With significant recent advancements in thermal sciences—such as the development of new theoretical and experimental techniques, and the discovery of new transport mechanisms—it is helpful to revisit the fundamentals of vibrational heat conduction to formulate an updated and informed physical understanding. The increasing maturity of simulation and modeling methods sparks the desire to leverage these techniques to rapidly improve and develop technology through digital engineering and multi-scale, electro-thermal models. With that vision in mind, this review attempts to build a holistic understanding of thermal transport by focusing on the often unaddressed relationships between subfields, which can be critical for multi-scale modeling approaches. For example, we outline the relationship between mode-specific (computational) and spectral (analytical) models. We relate thermal boundary resistance models based on perturbation approaches and classic transmissivity based models. We discuss the relationship between lattice dynamics and molecular dynamics approaches along with two-channel transport frameworks that have emerged recently and that connect crystal-like and amorphous-like heat conduction. Throughout, we discuss best practices for modeling experimental data and outline how these models can guide material-level and system-level design.
I. THERMAL SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGIES
A. Motivating thermal
As technology calls for more extreme structural and functional materials, pushing the upper and lower limits of thermal conductivity (κ) is an important scientific endeavor.1–3 Energy technologies, which consider thermal properties to be primary in design (e.g., thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coatings, thermal energy storage, battery thermal runaway), would greatly benefit from improved understanding and control of these limits. In fields where thermal properties are not considered to be primary (e.g., quantum information science, memristors, hypersonics), thermal properties can be closely tied to technological success. Developing these emerging technologies with thermal properties in mind can help identify engineering challenges and elucidate positive iterative design strategies. As performance limits are pushed to extremes in existing technologies (e.g., power electronics, communication electronics, opto-electronics, rapid charging of batteries), thermal management becomes critical and the co-design of electrical, optical, and thermal properties is necessary.
B. Digital engineering of transport
First principles simulations for thermal conductivity of perfect crystals has matured in the past decades,4 and the level of confidence in such predictions is perhaps the highest of any transport property. In the coming decades, there is tremendous potential in leveraging these first principles predictions in multi-scale models for materials containing extended defects and in device-level simulations.
Digital engineering methods (e.g., integrated computational materials engineering, ICME) have accelerated the development of structural materials, and they have successfully transferred from academic research to industry (see “From Atoms to Autos” in Ref. 5). One critical aspect enabling this success is the development of length-scale bridging methodologies, which connect atomistic simulations to device level materials properties. These length-scale bridging methodologies are rarely “one size fits all.” Different material and device classes often require tailored solutions, since the simplifying assumptions that are required and/or justified often change from case to case. There is a desire to apply similar digital engineering methods to electronic, thermal, and ionic transport; however, many of the required length-scale bridging methods require development and validation.
Since a solid computational baseline has been achieved in thermal transport of pristine materials, thermal transport is a logical field to pursue multi-scale digital engineering methods. The success of such a scientific initiative will pave the way for similar approaches in electronic and ionic transport, where first principles simulations are rapidly progressing.
C. Device-level considerations
While much focus is given to material level thermal properties in the literature, thermal heat sinking to the environment in device-level applications is often a primary challenge. When materials are incorporated into technological applications, the system-level heat transport problem should be considered; from the active material to the environment. For example, devices based on thin film thermoelectrics will often be forced into a regime where power is heat sink limited due to the large temperature gradients and heat fluxes required.6 For power electronics, Warzoha et al. provided a detailed review that highlights how the electronics packaging of transistors (e.g., interfaces, substrates, and heat spreaders) significantly impacts the nanoscale thermal environment and device performance.7 Even in amorphous
HfO
2
memristors, where the active device is a conductive filament that can be tens of atoms in diameter, the long-range thermal environment set by the device substrate has been shown to impact the memristive behavior.8,9 A common theme between these cases is that the thermal boundary condition from the device to environment is often critically important. Under fixed thermal boundary conditions, the material level properties become the primary factor influencing device performance.
D. Review outline
This review focuses on the materials physics governing thermal properties. Special attention is given to the interconnection of sub-fields, which is critical to multi-scale, digital engineering initiatives. Less focus will be given to material already covered in recent reviews,4,10–14 and the reader will be directed to sections of these works periodically.
We start with a broad overview of thermal transport (Sec. II). Critical concepts such as vibrational wave packets, harmonic normal mode decomposition, and phonon-gas and diffuson conduction channels are introduced at a conceptual level. Mathematical formalism is reviewed in the  Appendixes, which serve to establish notation and as technical reference for common computational and analytical equations and procedures. Content is then organized in increasing level of material disorder. First, phonons in perfect crystals are reviewed (Sec. III). Special focus is given to q-point sampling and the long wavelength (near Γ-point), low frequency limit, since behavior in this limit is expected to become increasingly important when multi-scale models are developed that consider extended defects and far-field thermal effects. Second, phonons in defective crystals are reviewed (Sec. IV). Analytical scattering theory is used to build intuition about the frequency dependence of phonon-defect scattering. Then, materials systems where lattice softening has been found to be important are highlighted, and potential mechanisms are discussed. Third, thermal boundary resistance is reviewed (Sec. V). While this may be considered a sub-category of phonons in defective crystals, it is broken out into its own section due to the uniqueness of measurements, simulations, and models used. Finally, thermal transport in disordered materials is reviewed (Sec. VI). In this case, the phonon-gas model breaks down and new materials design principles are required. These methods are discussed in relation to recently developed two-channel lattice dynamics approaches (unified lattice dynamics,15 quasi-harmonic Green-Kubo method16).
II. THERMAL TRANSPORT OVERVIEW
The thermal conductivity of a solid, κ, can be thought of as a sum of contributions from different heat conduction channels, which are commonly taken to be independent. The most common channels considered are atomic vibrations (⁠

⁠. It varies depending on the electronic band structure,17 but rarely more than 30%. One must be careful when the homogeneous solid approximation fails due to the presence of electrical resistance at grain boundaries.18 In this case,
κ
e
is expected to be underestimated, leading to an overestimation of
κ
vib
⁠. In materials where charge carriers do not behave as nearly free electron quasi-particles, such as VO219,20 and semiconducting polymers,21 the applicability of the Wiedemann-Franz law is debated and values of an effective Lorenz number can be far from the Sommerfeld value of L.
This review will focus on the heat carried by atomic vibrations

in solids at the upper (e.g., diamond) and lower (e.g., glass) limits of thermal conductivity, and also contributes appreciably to many technological materials in between (e.g., semiconductors).

In non-cubic materials, particularly layered compounds with van der Waals bonding, thermal anisotropy can be quite high. In this review κ implies κxx.

A. Wave-packets
When building an understanding of thermal transport, it is important to distinguish the concepts that emerge from wave-packet physics, specifically the relaxation time (τ), wavelength (λ), mean free path (Λ), and coherence length. In the context of vibrational thermal conductivity, wave packets are supported by the atoms bonded together in the solid. Atomic bonding is typically described by a spring mass model ( Appendix A). While it is not always obvious, many aspects of transport theories rely on the concepts of wave-packets. Therefore, it is beneficial to review basic concepts, which are shown schematically in both reciprocal space [Fig. 2(a)] and in real space [Figs. 2(b) and 2(c)].

The solid black line in Fig. 2(a) represents the frequency (ω) or energy (⁠

relationship is commonly referred to as a dispersion relation, and the individual states (labeled by the black dot) are referred to as plane-wave eigenstates. Details on how one obtains
ω
(

)
from interatomic force constants12 are given in Appendix A 1. The harmonic vibrational state (eigenstate) refers to the mode energy (eigenvalue) and mode polarization (eigenvector). A collection of these plane-wave eigenstates (spanning
Δ
q
about q) linearly combine to form a wave-packet [Fig. 2(b)]. In this way, plane-wave eigenstates that have an infinite spatial extent are used to describe quasi-particle wave-packets that have a finite spatial extent. This wave-packet has classically been referred to as a phonon. However, the phonon can be defined more generally as a harmonic vibration regardless of character, as discussed in Sec. II C. The spatial extent over which atomic vibrations are correlated is termed the coherence length, not to be confused with the mean free path or wavelength. Coherence length considerations are critically important when exploring phononic properties of materials and meta-materials.23 Latour and Chalopin24 provide a nice discussion regarding coherence length, where they distinguish the “spatial” coherence length (simply called the coherence length here) and the “temporal” coherence length (i.e., the mean free path
Λ
=
v
g
τ
stemming from the relaxation time τ). The speed at which the wave packet travels is its group velocity and is simply the slope of the dispersion relation (⁠
v
g
=
d
ω
/
d
q
⁠) at q.
When perturbations are considered (e.g., anharmonicity of the interatomic potential or crystal defects), there is a broadening of this dispersion relation. The broadening in energy is inversely proportional to the phonon lifetime and relaxation time (τ). This is depicted in real space Fig. 2(c) as the time the wave-packet may travel before being scattered by either other phonons or a crystal defect (not pictured). This relaxation time multiplied by the group velocity gives the distance the wave-packet traveled before scattering, or the mean free path (Λ).
The mean free path of a wave-packet will determine how “closely spaced” additional crystal defects will need to be in order to significantly influence its contribution to thermal conductivity. Note that a wide range of mean free paths exist in single material, making the problem inherently multiscale. The wavelength (λ) will determine the “physical size” of defects that will most strongly scatter the wave-packet [Eq. (12)].
B. Molecular dynamics and lattice dynamics
Two of the most common methods for simulating atomic dynamics and vibrational thermal conductivity are molecular dynamics (see recent reviews by DeAngelis et al.11 and Seyf et al.25) and lattice dynamics (see recent review by McGaughey et al.4).
Molecular dynamics (MD) is a real space method where the position and velocity of every atom is tracked as a function of time. Thermal transport can be computed directly from this information using Hardy's heat current operator26 along with the Green-Kubo method [see Eqs. (1) and (2) of DeAngelis et al.11] Lattice dynamics (LD) is, in a sense, a subset of molecular dynamics that asserts harmonic interatomic forces and periodic boundary conditions allowing a Fourier plane wave decomposition of the atomic motion to be used that completely describes the atomic dynamics. This Fourier decomposition inverts the problem, making lattice dynamics a reciprocal space method. The resulting plane waves (normal modes) can be identified by a wavevector (q), which defines the plane wave direction and wavelength (λ, where
q
=
2
π
/
λ
⁠). These plane waves are the so-called phonon eigenstates, and each has an associated eigenvector (mode shape) and eigenvalue (energy). These plane waves can transport thermal energy in wave packets (reviewed in Sec. II A). The mechanism of propagating wave packets conducting thermal energy is described by the common phonon-gas model. Since MD computes thermal transport directly from atomic positions and velocities, it is agnostic to the nature in which vibrational energy is transported and to the character of the vibrational modes participating. Traditionally, LD approaches have asserted the phonon-gas model, thereby only capturing the heat carried by propagating phonon wave packets. Recently, generalized, two-channel LD approaches have emerged that capture diffuson channel transport as well, an effect that extends beyond the phonon-gas model. Two-channel LD is discussed further in Sec. II D.
C. Phonon and diffuson taxonomy
The necessity to describe vibrational states that do not exhibit propagating character, yet still conduct thermal energy, has sparked a taxonomy for classifying vibrations based on their character27 (i.e., propagons, diffusons, locons). Consequently, there has been some debate on the definition of a phonon. DeAngelis et al. provide a discussion regarding this topic, which we briefly summarize here.11 Some consider a phonon as a quasi-particle that must exhibit propagating wave-packet behavior, which consist of attributes that fit into the phonon-gas model. We will refer to this as the “strict” viewpoint. Since it has been shown that, even in the harmonic limit (where the phonon normal mode decomposition is defined), vibrational modes can arise that do not exhibit propagating behavior,11,27 some authors consider the strict viewpoint to be too stringent. Taking a broader definition, a phonon is simply a quanta of normal mode vibrational energy, regardless of its character. We will refer to this as the “generalized” viewpoint. From the generalized viewpoint propagons and diffusons are not necessarily new quasi-particles, but can be considered types of phonons. A phonon that transports energy as a propagating wave-packet is succinctly denoted a propagon. A phonon that is not propagating but transports its heat diffusely is called a diffuson. A phonon that has its vibrational energy completely localized is a locon.
Additionally, a phonon that crosses below the Ioffe-Regal limit is not considered to be destroyed but, rather, loses its propagating character. This is similar to how electrons that cross below the Ioffe-Regal limit are not considered to be destroyed but can no longer be described as a nearly free electron that travels with a mean free path before scattering. Another benefit of the generalized viewpoint that it is naturally consistent with the observation that the transition from propagating to non-propagating character is a gradual process.28 Furthermore, localized rattling modes in crystals, as well as interfacial modes, have consistently been considered to be phonons, but they are indeed non-propagating. The generalized viewpoint will be taken in this review.
D. Two-channel lattice dynamics
Lattice dynamics based approaches rely on idealized, non-interacting, harmonic vibrational states as a starting basis for the heat conduction model (Appendix A 1). Using these harmonic states as a basis, vibrational heat conduction can be thought of as occurring through two channels,15,16,26,29,30 the phonon-gas channel (⁠
κ
pg
⁠) and the diffuson channel (⁠
κ
diff
⁠). These two channels contribute additively to the vibrational thermal conductivity
κ
vib
=
κ
pg
+
κ
diff
.
(3)
Physical results, meaning a non-infinite
κ
pg
and non-zero
κ
diff
⁠, are only obtained after considering perturbations to these harmonic vibrational states (e.g., phonon-phonon interactions). It's important to recognize that since the magnitudes of
κ
pg
and
κ
diff
are both set by the energy and broadening of the phonon states (Fig. 3), they are not as independent as Eq. (3) makes them seem.

The two channels can be understood through the concept of band folding, shown for one dimension in Fig. 3(a).29 As the size of the unit cell is increased, e.g., by modulating the interatomic force constants, the maximum q-vector decreases and more phonon branches can be found at the same q point, which is due to the creation of optical modes. As these modes are broadened due to anharmonicity and/or crystal defects, some of them may begin to overlap, making them quasi-degenerate.16 This is highlighted in red in Fig. 3(a). The thermal conductivity within the two-channel lattice dynamics framework can be thought of as a square matrix, with rows and columns designating normal modes [Fig. 3(b)]. The diagonal and off-diagonal elements of this matrix have distinctly different physical interpretations. The diagonal components (⁠
s
=
s
′
⁠) give the phonon-gas channel [
κ
pg
⁠, Eq. (B1)], and the off-diagonal components (⁠
s
≠
s
′
⁠) give the diffuson channel [
κ
diff
⁠, Eq. (56)]. The physical picture of the phonon-gas channel involves propagating wave packets. The physical picture of the diffuson channel involves non-propagating oscillators, which can be defined across many atoms, exchanging energy with each other.
The diffuson channel is, in principle, present in all solids, but tends to become important in amorphous materials,16,27 crystalline materials that are very anharmonic,15 and/or structurally complex crystals that have many atoms per unit cell.29,32 As defects are introduced, it is expected that the phonon-gas channel will be suppressed and the diffuson channel will be promoted due to increasing mode overlap.11 At the highest temperatures, the diffuson channel is expected to dominate.31 The transition between
κ
pg
- and
κ
diff
-dominated heat conduction with increasing crystal complexity, anharmonicity, defect concentration, and temperature is an important avenue of ongoing research. The historical paradigm is that the phonon-gas channel is so large in crystals that
κ
vib
≈
κ
pg
⁠. It is now becoming clear that this approximation is likely not valid for many technologically relevant materials, particularly those with low κ.
E. Ballistic and diffuse transport regimes
It is important not to confuse the diffusive transport regime for the phonon-gas channel with the diffuson channel. Within the diffusive transport regime of the phonon-gas channel, phonon wave packets are still thought to be propagating a length equal to their mean free path at the micro-scale. This is precisely the reason ballistic effects can become important when considering the phonon-gas channel. In contrast, vibrational modes conducting through the diffuson channel do not exhibit propagating character and are not expected to exhibit any ballistic transport effects, no matter how small the length scale considered.
When considering propagating phonons in the phonon-gas channel, one must be mindful of ballistic transport effects. Fourier's law, given in Eq. (2), assumes diffusive transport and predicts that the thermal energy flux (ji) will continue to increase no matter how large the temperature gradient (⁠
∇
j
T
⁠) becomes. In reality, a limit exists where all phonon wave packets are traveling ballistically through the sample unperturbed. It can be helpful to consider the analogous, and perhaps more familiar, propagation of light. A photon propagating through clear air unperturbed is traveling ballistically. A photon traveling in hazy air scatters frequently and transports diffusely. Fourier's law describes diffuse propagation. When a phonon's mean free path [defined in Fig. 2(c)] is larger than (or approximately equal to) the characteristic length scale of
∇
T
⁠, then a ballistic phonon transport regime is entered. When a phonon's mean free path is smaller than the characteristic length scale of
∇
T
⁠, there is diffusive transport and Fourier's law holds. The importance of ballistic effects depends on the material system and the length and time scale of temperature gradients being considered. When considering experimental error in the measurement of
κ
vib
(commonly 3% via laser flash analysis) and temperature (commonly 5% at a
0.5
μ
m
resolution via thermoreflectance imaging), Fourier's law and the relaxation time approximation tend be sufficient for materials such as Si and GaN (see Fig. 5 of Carrete et al.33) and the accuracy of these approximations is expected to increase as
κ
vib
of the material decreases.
Open source computational packages such as almaBTE provide tools for examining ballistic transport effects,33 which can become important in high thermal conductivity materials. The work of Hua and Minnich34 provides a framework to experimentally probe and simulate the transition between transport regimes based on a frequency dependent Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) approach. Other methods for capturing ballistic effects include the McKelvey-Shockley flux method35 and phonon hydrodynamics.36 
In systems with very large thermal gradients, such as power electronics, a model based on Fourier's law may over predict thermal conduction, due to the presence of ballistic effects. For example, Donmezer and Graham showed that spatially localized (⁠
<
1
μ
m
⁠) hot spots in electronic devices reach higher temperatures than is predicted from a model based solely on Fourier's law.37 However, this effect is expected to be difficult to measure given that the spatial resolution of temperature measurements is commonly
∼
0.5
μ
m
(e.g., thermoreflectance imaging).
In general, models based on Fourier's law (such as finite element analysis, FEA) are more versatile in terms of system geometry and the different materials that can be considered, but neglect ballistic transport effects. While a mode specific BTE simulation of an entire device remains intractable, FEA models can be modified to artificially capture ballistic effects (e.g., by modifying κ based on various conditions), or by creating a multi-scale transport model. However, the development of these approaches is still an active area of research.
III. PHONONS IN PERFECT CRYSTALS
Before examining how crystalline defects will influence heat conduction by phonons, we first review phonons in perfect crystals.
κ
vib
is often dominated by
κ
pg
in perfect crystals. We refer the reader to the review provided by McGaughey et al. for a detailed tutorial of
κ
pg
computed via DFT based lattice dynamics.4 Here, we focus on aspects that are critical for multi-scale modeling considerations (such as the long-wavelength limit) and for building intuition regarding the influence of defects and disorder.
A. Phonon-gas thermal conductivity
The computation of the phonon-gas channel of perfect crystals via DFT based lattice dynamics, where phonon properties are computed mode-specifically [Eq. (B1)], has become common in the field. However, in systems containing crystal defects (particularly extended defects), which is a main focus of this review, this procedure may become prohibitively difficult or even impossible. In these cases, spectral treatments, where phonon properties are characterized as a function of frequency (ω), may be required. Additionally, a spectral decomposition of a mode specific model may be desired for purposes of multi-scale modeling and/or interpreting results. In  Appendix B we provide a spectral decomposition of the mode specific model given in Eq. (B1), resulting in

using mode specific quantities as in Eqs. (B4) and (B5), it is common to define them analytically using semi-empirical expressions for the phonon dispersion relation and relaxation time (Appendix B 3). This procedure is commonly called Callaway-Klemens type modeling and can be useful when interpreting emergent phenomena in the thermal transport of complex, defective systems where a mode resolved treatment [Eq. (B1)] is not warranted, prohibitively difficult, and/or not possible.
Figure 4 shows the spectral decomposition of a mode specific model for Si at 300 K. Harmonic interatomic forces are used to compute the dispersion relation [Fig. 4(a)], heat capacity [Fig. 4(b)], and group velocity [Fig. 4(c)]. Three-phonon scattering, built from anharmonic 3rd order interatomic force constants, broadens the phonon modes in energy [Fig. 4(d)] and thus gives finite relaxation times (Fig. 4). The solid black curves in Figs. 4(b), 4(c) and 4(e) are computed using the spectral decompositions given in Eqs. (B3), (B4), and (B5), respectively. These phonon properties combine to give the spectral thermal conductivity due to the phonon-gas channel (Fig. 4). It can be seen that the majority of the heat is carried by acoustic phonons, below
25
meV
⁠, due primarily to their very long relaxation times. While optical phonons indeed have a lower
v
g
(
ω
)
⁠, they carry much less heat primarily due to their very low τ, due to strong phonon-phonon scattering.

B. The low-ω challenge
Here we take a closer look at the behavior of low-ω phonons in perfect crystals. Understanding the expected behavior of
κ
pg

as

→

is particularly important when approximating Brillouin zone integration via q-meshing procedures, when implementing multi-scale models, and when considering the impact of micro-structure, grain boundaries, interfaces (Sec. V), and dislocation strain fields (Sec. IV). First we review the analytical aspects of the problem and then discuss how the analytical conclusions compare to results obtained using uniform q-meshing procedures. Our discussion is constrained to 3D systems. Low-dimensional materials exhibit different ω-dependencies in their density of vibrational states, so conclusions may not directly translate from 3D to 2D or 1D systems.38 
We start by considering a question that has been debated historically:39–42 Will a defect-free, infinitely large crystal have infinite thermal conductivity? In such a case, the only phonon scattering mechanism would be scattering with other phonons due to natural anharmonicity of the crystal potential. While this question may seem academic, a conclusive answer would bring with it more accurate predictions of how extended defects such as interfaces will influence the thermal conductivity, which is a topic of technological importance.
One can understand this problem by examining the spectral decomposition of the phonon-gas thermal conductivity [
κ
pg
(
ω
)
]. To see where the proposed question arises, we examine the lower bound of the integral over ω. First, we assign
τ
(

the general form
τ

which contains a temperature dependent constant A(T) (to be discussed later) and an arbitrary frequency dependence n. As

From this representation one can easily see that the exponent in the power law dependence of the lifetime, n, is the critical parameter. If phonons exhibit a power law dependence with
n
≥
3
⁠, then
κ
pg
will diverge to infinity (at any temperature) if there are no other phonon scattering mechanisms. Only 3-phonon scattering processes are considered. Other effects contributing to τ can be important at very low frequency (e.g., MHz), such as thermoelastic and Akhieser damping.43 The phonon spectrum extends up to the
THz
scale; therefore, in the context of the thermal transport of phonons we only consider 3-phonon processes. Consequently, the power law dependence of the phonon lifetime at low-ω is critical for determining the strength at which extended defects, such as interfaces and dislocations, will reduce
κ
pg
⁠. Early theories predicted phonon lifetimes at low ω would exhibit n = 4; therefore, several theories have indeed predicted that the thermal conductivity would diverge to infinity if the material was infinitely large and defect free.42 There are several consequences of phonons exhibiting
n
≥
3
⁠. First, the thermal conductivity of very clean crystals would continue to increase as crystal size increases. Second, the thermal conductivity determined computationally would not converge with increasing q-mesh density. It seems that these attributes are not typically observed, suggesting that in most cases n < 3.
Figure 5 shows the lifetimes from Fig. 4(e) on a log-log scale. The lines show a
τ

show an

This example agrees with the results presented by Ward and Broido, and the reader is referred to their work for more discussion on low-ω behavior of τ in Si and Ge.44 We examine results within the relaxation time approximation that do not distinguish between Umklapp and Normal processes. As Maznev and Wright pointed out, since no rigid line can be drawn between Umklapp and Normal processes, distinguishing them in a model can create difficulties.45 In this review, the term “phonon-phonon scattering” embodies both Umklapp and Normal processes.

Computing measurable properties such as heat capacity, diffusivity, and thermal conductivity requires integration of the Brillouin zone. Standard q-meshing procedures used to approximate this integration can lead to misinterpretation of the importance of low-ω acoustic phonons, seeming to predict

The computational results in Fig. 4(f) make it seem as if phonons below
∼

do not carry heat. This conclusion may even seem intuitive since there are very few phonon modes at this low energy; i.e., the pDOS and
C
(
ω

go to 0 as
ω
→
0
⁠. However, this attribute is simply an artifact of the uniform q-meshing procedure and, through the analytical considerations discussed herein, low-ω phonons are indeed important for thermal conductivity.
To reiterate this important point, we define the amount of heat carried by phonons within a small band of frequencies

κ

for Si using Gaussian quadrature in Cartesian coordinates for the q-mesh sampling compared with a q-mesh with similar number of sampled points but in spherical coordinates, which allows for better sampling at long wavelengths. Increasing the mesh density, in order to sample longer wavelengths, scales as N3 for a uniform mesh; whereas it scales as N for a spherical mesh. The green line shows a linear fit based on Eq. (8) where the slope essentially gives A(T). The poor long wavelength sampling is reflected in the sharp steps seen in the red line. While the magnitude of
κ
pg
has converged and agrees between the uniform and spherical q-mesh, the spectral properties at low-ω and long wavelength are represented differently.
Extended crystal defects, such as dislocations and interfaces, are known to influence low-frequency, long-wavelength phonons, as we discuss in Sec. IV. Therefore, q-meshing techniques that sample near Γ-point phonons will likely be critical when building ab initio based multi-scale models.
2. Lifetimes of low-ω phonons in GaN
Low-ω phonon lifetimes have been measured in GaN,47,48 which provides an important experimental comparison with the computational and analytical considerations previously discussed in Sec. III B. These measurements utilize the attenuation of sub-THz and THz longitudinal acoustic waves to directly measure the intrinsic phonon relaxation times due to phonon-phonon interactions. Alternatively, phonon lifetimes can be extracted from the linewidths of inelastic x-ray and neutron scattering experiments.48–51 However, low-frequency data is usually buried in the elastic scattering (diffraction) peaks and the accuracy of the extracted lifetimes can be limited by instrument resolution.
Figure 7 shows experimental lifetimes of longitudinal acoustic phonons from Liu et al.47 (green squares) and Chou et al.48 (blue squares), compared to DFT-based simulations48 (orange circles) and an analytical model with a form provided by Slack52 (black line),

Rather than extracting the coefficients C1 and C2 from attenuation data (which is limited in the literature) or simulation, as they were in Fig. 7, they may be computed via material properties. The exponential term increases with decreasing temperature and is meant to capture the increased proportion of momentum conserving phonon-phonon scattering processes (Normal) to momentum non-conserving (Umklapp) processes, resulting in decreased thermal resistance from phonon-phonon scattering. As such,

IV. PHONONS IN DEFECTIVE CRYSTALS
Having reviewed heat conduction through the phonon-gas channel (⁠
κ
pg
⁠) in perfect crystals, we look at the influence of defects. We attempt to build physical intuition that can guide technologically relevant thermal design strategies using materials chemistry, nano/microstructure, and synthesis and fabrication procedures, as well as aid in the analysis of computational simulations. The foundational analytical treatment reviewed here illustrates behaviors expected from “first order” physics. Deviations from these analytical expectations may reveal novel physical behaviors, which may be observed experimentally or computationally. Furthermore, an understanding of analytical theories can be used to identify practical limitations of simulation methods where far-field effects can be difficult to capture.
Two fundamentally different mechanisms through which defects influence the vibrational thermal conductivity are phonon scattering and lattice softening. While these mechanisms influence both the phonon-gas and diffuson channels, we first focus on their impact on the phonon-gas channel, which to date has been more extensively studied. Both are illustrated in Fig. 8.

Phonon-defect scattering broadens phonon linewidths beyond intrinsic linewidths due to phonon-phonon scattering [Figs. 8(b) and 8(c)]. The average phonon energies and interatomic forces in the solid are assumed to remain constant. Therefore, the elastic moduli, mode specific heats, and speeds of sound are also assumed unchanged.
Elastic softening (also referred to as lattice softening) refers to the mechanism by which defects modify the average elastic moduli, speeds of sound, and energy of the phonons in a material—as illustrated in Fig. 8. Since, elastic softening alters the phonon dispersion, the maximum acoustic phonon frequency
ω
max
⁠, heat capacity
C
(

⁠, and phonon propagation (group) velocities

are also changed. Additionally, the intrinsic phonon-phonon scattering is modified since the phase space for scattering depends critically on the phonon density of states (pDOS), or more specifically the joint density of states [see Eqs. (20)–(24) of Togo et al.12).
Figures 8(b)–8(d) represent these effects in reciprocal space. Figure 8(a) schematically represents this in real space. The phonon scattering picture shows the phonon changing propagation direction while its frequency is unchanged. The lattice softening picture shows a decrease in phonon frequency and propagation speed. In Secs. IV A and IA B, we will examine the theoretical and experimental implications of these two distinct mechanisms.
A. Defect scattering
Defects in an otherwise perfect crystal perturb the phonon Hamiltonian, H [given in Eq. (A5)]. If this perturbation varies in space and/or time, it can induce phonon scattering. In this section, we discuss the effects of spatially varying perturbations by considering defect-induced scattering potentials,
V
(
r
)
⁠, and resulting phonon scattering processes computed in the context of Fermi's Golden Rule perturbation theory (i.e., in the Born approximation). We consider only elastic interactions, meaning the incident and outgoing phonons conserve energy.
1. Effect of defect dimensionality
We start by considering the relationship of the scattering defect dimensionality with the ω-dependence of the phonon lifetime. In doing so, we will find a deeper understanding of specular (the conservation of momentum in one or more directions) vs diffuse scattering. We attempt to capture first order physics and, therefore, make several approximations to achieve closed form expressions that help establish physical intuition. Specifically, we make the isotropic dispersion approximation and do not consider mode conversion (and therefore suppress the branch index, s). The conclusions made regarding defect dimensionality, specularity, phase space, and ω-dependence are expected to hold when these approximations are removed.
We follow the basic precepts of phonon scattering theory and its contribution to lattice thermal conductivity as laid out, for example, by Ziman.55 By applying these precepts to elastic scattering from a defect with scattering potential

indicates that the magnitude of the matrix element squared has been weighted by the forward scattering parameter (which states that a
q

q

⁠. The essential point, indicated by the subscript

⁠, the codimension of the defect. That is,
n

(13)
with

and
n

⁠, for a point defect
d
d
=

and
n

⁠, and so on.
We can understand Eq. (11) as follows. Consider a line defect (⁠
n
¯
=
2
⁠) parallel to the z axis. In addition to the energy, the z component of the phonon wavevector must be conserved when scattering with this defect. In this case, “specular scattering” occurs in the z-direction, which results in the phonon scattering onto a circle in q-space, and when summing over all possible final state wavevectors the density of accessible phonon states is effectively that of a system with two real spatial dimensions, written as
g
2
d
⁠. At the same time, the matrix element of the perturbation reduces to an integral over the coordinates perpendicular to the defect, x and y, and since this is now a two-dimensional integral, we write it as
M

d

2. Mass contrast scattering
Now that we have established the kinematic and phase space effects that arise from considering a scattering potential's dimensionality, we consider the nature of the scattering potential itself. It is instructive to first consider the effect of a change in atomic mass. By examining the two terms in H [Eq. (A1)], it can be seen that a change in mass will perturb the phonon states through the lattice kinetic energy, T [Eq. (A2)]. Within the formalism provided in  Appendix D, the scattering potential due to a change in atomic mass at point r in a crystal is
V

)
=

(
Δ

δ

(16)
This describes the scattering potential due to mass difference of a point defect or isotope, and is shown graphically in Fig. 9(a).
δ
(
r
)
is the three-dimensional δ-function, and V0 is the volume that the mass fluctuation occupies. Recall that
δ
(
r
)
has units of
1
/
(
volume
)
⁠, so the quantity
V
0
δ
(
r
)
is unitless. V, therefore, has the correct units of energy. Care must be taken to ensure that V0 and the mass fluctuation parameter
Δ
M
/
M
are defined consistently. A consistent method that translates well to multiatomic unit cells56 is to define V0 as the average atomic volume, and
Δ
M
=
M
def
−
M
s
¯
⁠, where
M
def
is the mass of the defect species occupying a site on the s sublattice and
M
s
¯
is the average mass of all atoms on that sublattice. In a multiatomic lattice, a final stoichiometric average over all sublattices must be performed on the matrix element, such that the scattering rate is proportional to the average atomic mass variance of the full crystal.56,57 In the denominator, M is then the average mass of all atoms in the crystal.
Off-stoichiometric defects, such as vacancies and interstitial atoms, have a uniquely large scattering strength because the addition or removal of bonds at the defect site produces a large potential energy perturbation. A simple model developed by Ratsifaritana and Klemens invokes the virial theorem to relate the potential energy perturbation to the average atomic mass in the lattice (M).58,59 In this case,
Δ
M
=
M
def
+
2
M
⁠, where
M
def
is the missing/added mass at the vacancy/interstitial defect. As a result, these off-stoichiometric defects have about 3 times the scattering strength of a simple, substitutional mass defect.56 
The Fourier transform of Eq. (16) is trivial given the presence of
δ
(
r

⁠, and with Eq. (D24) we can define the matrix element contribution to

When the Debye approximation is asserted, Eq. (18) is identical to the formula provided by Klemens,60 and the analytical expression provided by Tamura [Eq. (23) of Ref. 61].
Now suppose the mass fluctuation is arranged as a line through the crystal at

Note that, here,

⁠. Equation (23) has the same form as the expression given by Turk and Klemens [Eq. (19) of Ref. 62], which was derived for platelet-like coherent precipitates.
The treatment described above for mass difference scattering demonstrates how defect dimensionality affects phonon scattering rates. In each case, the matrix elements contribute
ω
2
to
τ
−
1
⁠. This stems from the fact that the mass fluctuations considered are localized in spatial extent and are therefore well described using δ-functions. This is illustrated and tabulated in the top portion of Fig. 9. When the dimensionality of the defect is changed from a point to a line to a plane, the phase space into which the phonon can scatter is altered. This changes the phase space contribution to
τ
−
1
⁠, which follows the expression provided in Eq. (14) and is tabulated in the bottom portion of Fig. 9. These phase space effects hold for all types of phonon-defect scattering. However, we will find in Sec. IV A 4 that when the scattering potential is a more complex function in real space, the matrix element contributions are more interesting.
3. Strain and anharmonicity
Internal strain fields can induce phonon scattering through anharmonicity of interatomic forces. The same dimensionality and phase space effects that were discussed in the context of mass contrast scattering are present in strain scattering. However, since the strain fields tend to have more complex behavior in real space, the matrix element contributions (⁠
M
n
¯
d
⁠) to phonon scattering tend to be more interesting for phonon-strain field scattering. The matrix element contains the Fourier transform of the scattering potential; therefore, the real space behavior of the strain field will influence the ω-dependence of the matrix element contribution and by extension ω-dependence of the scattering rate. This will be discussed further in the context of dislocations in Sec. IV A 4.
When considering phonon–strain field interactions, it is important to clearly distinguish the concepts of anharmonicity and inelastic scattering. This distinction can be understood in the context of third order perturbation theory. Consider the third order contribution to the interatomic potential energy,
U
3
rd
[Eqs. (A3) and (A4)]. Third order anharmonicity in the context of phonon-phonon interactions leads to inelastic scattering since each atomic displacement vector (⁠
u
i
α
,
u
j
β
⁠, and
u
k
γ
⁠) in
U
3
rd
corresponds to a phonon [Fig. 10(a)]. Phonon one (e.g.,
u
i
α
⁠) can be thought of as absorbing or emitting the energy of phonon two (⁠
u
j
β
⁠), which induces the transition into the phonon three (⁠
u
k
γ
⁠) of different energy. In contrast, when a phonon interacts with a static strain field [Fig. 10(b)], one of the atomic displacement vectors (e.g.,
u
j
β
⁠) can be thought of as representing the static strain field, which does not absorb or emit energy. Therefore, phonon one (⁠
u
i
α
⁠) and three (⁠
u
k
γ
⁠) must have the same energy. This concept is reflected in Eq. (19) of Carruthers, and the surrounding text,63 and is illustrated here in Fig. 10.

4. Dislocations
The description of phonon-dislocation interactions is a complex topic with a long history.60,63,65,66 It has been reviewed recently in the context of ab initio simulations (see Sec. III.2 in Lindsay et al.10). Here, we first discuss mechanisms for phonon-dislocation interactions (i.e., core, strain field, fluttering) and conceptualize the ω-dependence of the phonon scattering rate in the context of phase space and matrix element effects. We then review some recent cases where phonon-dislocation interactions have impacted technology. Finally, we highlight how dislocations behave as foundational defects, in that they provide a basis for describing more complex systems such as interfaces and even some aspects of amorphous materials (Fig. 11).
Dislocations are linear defects often described by two characteristic components, the dislocation core and the long-ranged strain field it induces. Early continuum-based models suggested that dislocation strain field scattering is generally larger than dislocation core scattering,63,67 a conclusion that has since been supported in wurtzite GaN68 using a Green's function approach based on DFT force constants.69 However, dislocation cores are expected to couple to high frequency phonons,70,71 and are shown to play a significant role in certain systems depending on dislocation density and type.
The dislocation strain field falls off as
ε
∝
1
/
r
⁠, where r is the distance from the dislocation core. This results in a dislocation that resides in an infinite crystal exhibiting an infinite strain energy72 and is often referred to as the “long-ranged” nature of dislocation strain. The strain energy and strength of phonon dislocation scattering is therefore expected to depend on the size of the crystallite the dislocation occupies, as well as the number and arrangement of other dislocations in the crystal due to interference between their individual strain fields. In simulations, dislocations are often arranged in configurations that cancel out this long-ranged strain field such that the defect can be contained within a simulation cell using periodic boundary conditions and a size that is not prohibitively large. In such configurations, the results of the simulation are expected to more heavily weight the dislocation core properties since much of the long range strain field is cancelled out.73 
Dislocation strain scattering scales as
τ
−
1
∝
ω
1
⁠. This ω-dependence can be rationalized by considering the strain field scattering potential,
V
(
r
)
=
ℏ
ω
γ
ε
(
r
)
[Eq. (28)]. The Fourier transform of this scattering potential is ω independent at low-ω, since the Fourier transform of
1
/
r
contributes a
1
/
q
⁠, and q is proportional to ω at low ω. This yields a ω-independent matrix element contribution (⁠

⁠). Therefore the only ω dependence from dislocation strain scatter originates from phase space considerations,

Dislocations are also known to introduce vibrational states, which are not native to the pristine crystal.75–77 It is important to distinguish dislocation “vibrational” motion (fluttering), from dislocation “glide” motion (often referred to simply as dislocation motion). Dislocation glide motion refers to the movement of the dislocation through the crystal and requires the breaking/making of bonds.
Early thermal conductivity measurements on LiF crystals containing dislocations at low temperatures by Anderson and co-workers,65 indicated a dislocation scattering strength far larger than that predicted from phonons interacting with the static dislocation strain field. This led to the conclusion that the fluttering mechanism dominates in LiF at low temperatures. Later measurements by Zhu and Anderson66 on Ge crystals containing dislocations showed much better agreement with static strain field scattering models. The conclusion that static strain field scattering dominates has been made in Si,78 Ge,66,79 Nb and Ta single crystals,80 Cu-Al alloys,81 and more recently in GaN.68,82 MD simulations and dislon theory have the capacity to capture phonon interactions with vibrating dislocations.76,83,183 By quantizing the dislocation field and defining a dislon Hamiltonian, the dislon formalism has the ability to treat the electron-phonon-dislocation on equal footing.84 Additionally, it has the capacity to capture normal mode re-normalization and predicts significant lattice softening [Fig. 4(a) of Li et al.76]. Perturbation theory [Eq. (11)], which is commonly used to compute phonon-defect scattering rates, often neglects the presence of these dislocation induced vibrational states and only considers scattering due to the dislocation core and strain field.
Dislocations are a foundational lattice defect and the base unit for many other extended defects, such as grain boundaries and heterointerfaces.85 Dislocation models for grain boundaries stem back to the classic Read-Schockley model,86 which describes the structure of low-angle grain boundaries (misorientation angle less than about
15
°
⁠). Since then the field of bicyrstallography has extended this concept to mathematically describe all crystalline grain boundaries as arrays of dislocations (see Sec. 2.3 of Priester87). Additionally, it is not uncommon to use dislocations and closely related disclinations88 to describe the structural properties of amorphous materials.89–91 Some have extended this concept to model the thermal conductivity of glasses at very low temperatures92 where propagating phonons and the phonon-gas channel are expected to become important.
Phonon-dislocation interactions have gained attention recently in various technological fields. Many of the growth techniques for III-V compounds (e.g., GaN, InN) introduce a large number dislocations. Therefore, phonon-dislocation interactions can influence the thermal management of opto-electronic and power electronic devices.82,93 A recent investigation even showed that directionally aligned dislocations could be used to engineer anisotropic thermal transport in otherwise fairly isotropic InN thin films for the purposes of directed heat dissipation.93 Dislocations have also emerged as an effective means to decrease the vibrational thermal conductivity in thermoelectrics while maintaining a high electronic mobility.94 
B. Softening
As discussed in Sec. IV A, crystal defects induce phonon scattering and reduce thermal conductivity by decreasing phonon lifetimes and mean free paths. From the common perturbation perspective, the bulk speed of sound and overall phonon dispersion is assumed to remain constant. This is to say that only phonon scattering is considered. Here, we review another important mechanism, which has received relatively less attention, where the average phonon velocities are altered directly.
In light of Eq. (4), phonon velocities are expected to play a significant role in the thermal transport of a phonon gas. Intuitively, to reduce thermal conductivity, it is desirable to reduce the average phonon velocity. This reduction can be referred to as elastic softening, lattice softening, or phonon softening. The average phonon velocity may be characterized by the bulk speed of sound95 insomuch as it captures the average frequency of the phonon density of states.96,97 Nevertheless, we consider measurements of the speed of sound to reflect changes to the bulk material in a thermodynamic sense. A measurement of defect induced elastic softening of a bulk material (such as ultrasound or heat capacity) indicates that the defects are present at a sufficient concentration to alter the bulk properties of the material. In this sense elastic softening goes beyond the classic perturbation approach since the average properties of the defective material are better described by a softened phonon dispersion and reduced elastic moduli.
The relative importance of elastic softening for tuning thermal transport (as compared to scattering) is expected to be larger in materials that have small intrinsic phonon mean free paths. In general, this pertains to materials at high temperature, having strong anharmonicity, and/or with high electronic charge carrier concentrations (Sec. IV B 2). Phonon softening expresses itself through several experimentally accessible material parameters, some of which are discussed in Sec. IV B 1.
Identifying and characterizing the physiochemical mechanisms that result in elastic softening is still an active area of research, as discussed in Sec. IV B 2.
1. Characterization methods
The acoustic phonon branches near the Γ-point can be characterized by bulk measurements such as the speed of sound and Debye temperature (see  Appendix E for a detailed discussion), both of which relate directly to the elastic moduli.98 As discussed in Sec. III, the acoustic branches are typically the dominant heat carriers, and their behavior at the Γ-point is expected to reflect the behavior of higher frequency phonon modes of similar polarization. Other experimental probes valuable to the study of lattice softening include:99 Raman spectroscopy (which can measure energies of optical phonons at the Γ-point), Brillouin light scattering, and inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering (which can measure phonon dispersions and densities of states).
It is important to recognize that elastic softening is expected to significantly reduce thermal conductivity if the energy of acoustic modes is decreased. Tracking the energy of optical modes with Raman spectroscopy is not a direct measurement of the softening of acoustic branches, though it may be related.
2. Models and mechanisms
The mechanisms of elastic softening are, likely, not yet fully characterized. However, it has been shown that increased internal strain95 (corresponding to residual stresses inside the dense material) and increased electronic carrier concentrations100 are both correlated with elastic softening. The former is expected from the Grüneisen relation,64 whereas the latter can be understood as a change in bond strength due to the population/de-population of bonding and anti-bonding orbitals as electrons are added or removed from the system. There are other reports of elastic softening without mention of an explicit mechanism.101 
From a thermodynamic perspective, elastic softening corresponds to an increase in the vibrational entropy
S
vib
of a material. Since there is a general observation that entropy tends to increase when work is done to a system, softening may be expected to result due to changes in various thermodynamic variables. Considering a free energy function, such as the Helmholtz free energy

an increase in entropy S is expected if the free energy is increased by pressure-volume (pdV) work and/or by the arbitrary conjugate variables Xi and ai representing mechanism i. This effect has been coined the compensation law and has been demonstrated in free-energy-driven Arrhenius processes102 and in the thermodynamics of solid-solutions.103 Entropy in a system can contain several contributions such as vibrational and configurational entropy (⁠

⁠). As there may be other mechanisms by which the material can increase the total entropy, then the magnitude of softening depends on the specifics of the material system. It may be possible, however, to utilize Maxwell relations to relate the magnitude of softening to other material properties, which is the origin of the Grüneisen parameter64 [Eq. (26)].
Nevertheless, even rather subtle changes in phonon velocities can have drastic consequences for thermal transport. Especially for phonon gas transport at high temperatures (⁠

V. THERMAL BOUNDARY RESISTANCE
Understanding the thermal effects of grain boundaries and interfaces is often critical to device performance, since these planar defects are often present in engineered materials. In power electronics, the objective is to minimize thermal resistances at boundary defects to improve device heat dissipation, which leads to an increase in power density, switching speeds, and device lifetime. In contrast, the increasingly common nanostructuring paradigm for thermoelectrics aims to suppress thermal transport by creating a high density of thermally resistive grain boundaries, which should not greatly perturb the electronic transport.
Fundamental questions about how thermal boundary resistance relates to the structure and composition at the boundary can be difficult to answer, since bulk thermal conductivity measurements typically probe the ensemble averaged interface scattering in a polycrystal. In addition, while isolating and characterizing a single interface is possible, it is currently time intensive and expensive. Nonetheless, recent progress has been made in measuring,106,107 modeling,108–110 and understanding the thermal boundary resistance (⁠
R

(33)
where j is the heat current normal to the interface, and
Δ

is the temperature drop across the interface.
To realize an engineering strategy for interfacial thermal transport, several materials level questions must be addressed, including: When constituent materials are fixed, what chemistry and structure-related factors set
R
B
⁠, and can they be controlled? If so, how much can
R
B
be tuned using chemistry and processing? If constituent materials are not fixed for a particular application, can materials be selected to intentionally increase or decrease
R
B
?
A. Measurement methods
Accurate measurements of thermal boundary resistance (⁠
R
B
⁠) are typically expensive and time intensive in part because of the difficulty in isolating a single interface. Additionally, the characterization of interfacial structure and vibrational properties is often required to interpret the measurements, which is also expensive. Two widely utilized methods for measuring the thermal boundary conductance (⁠
h
B
⁠) and resistance (⁠
R
B
⁠) are the 3ω method111,112 and time domain thermoreflectance (TDTR).107,113–116 The 3ω method uses a metal wire deposited on the sample surface to both apply the heat pulse and measure temperature through the temperature dependent resistivity of the wire. The TDTR method uses a pump-probe laser to both apply the heat pulse and measure temperature through the temperature dependent reflectively on the sample surface (or more commonly a metal transducer). Both methods rely on the measurement of temperature vs time after a thermal pulse is applied to the sample and a model is used to determine the thermal properties of interest such as the thermal conductivity or the
R
B
of interfaces within the sample. Samples often consist of layers of materials (transducer/sample/substrate) and the sensitivity to the
R
B
of a specific interface is highly dependent on the thermal conductivity and thickness of the layers, and thermal penetration depth of the measurement, which is tuned by changing the frequency of the heat pulse (in both
3
ω
and TDTR methods). Therefore, these types of measurements rely on careful sample design and models that predict the sensitivity of the measurement to various sample geometries and measurement conditions.
The 3ω method starts by applying an oscillating current through the heater wire at
1
ω
⁠. This induces a localized Joule heating at
2
ω
⁠. The increased temperature changes the resistivity of the wire also at
2
ω
⁠. The measured voltage then oscillates at
3
ω
⁠, since this signal contains both the
1
ω
applied current and the
2
ω
change in resistance. The thermal properties of the sample are contained within this
3
ω
voltage signal. Compared with TDTR method, 3ω is a relatively simple and low-cost method, since it requires the application of electrodes and standard electronics (i.e., voltmeters and a lock-in amplifier). However, when measuring
R
B
⁠, care must be taken in sample design and preparation to ensure that the geometry and thermal properties of the electrode, sample layers, and substrate result in a measurement that is sensitive to the
R
B
of interest. Since 3ω method relies on the electrical voltage oscillation, there are complexities that arise when measuring metals and semiconductors. In these cases, an electrically insulating layer is needed between the sample and the metal sensor, which may decrease the sensitivity of the measurement to a buried interface of interest.
For metal/semiconductor interfaces, the metal (e.g., Al and Au) can sometimes be directly used as the transducer for TDTR measurement, which makes TDTR method suitable for metal-non-metal interfaces.107 For efficient heat dissipation in devices, a high thermal boundary conductance (TBC) is usually preferred to improve the device thermal management, and
h
B
can be
100
MW
/
m
2
K
or higher. The sensitivity of TDTR to high TBC interfaces can be sufficient, and the sensitivity increases with substrate thermal conductivity.14 However, because of the optical nature of TDTR method, it usually requires high quality of the sample surface (surface roughness within tens of nanometers), which is not necessary for 3ω measurement. The penetration depth of TDTR is usually from tens of nanometers to a few microns at room temperature and depends on the modulation frequency (usually about several MHz) and material thermal properties. Therefore, sensitivity limitations can make the measurement of deeply buried interfaces difficult. Recently, steady-state thermoreflectance (SSTR) with much lower modulation frequency (about 100 Hz) was shown to exhibit a much larger penetration depth making it a promising method for the measurement of TBC of buried interfaces moving forward.117 
Models for
R
B
and
h
B
(TBC) often do not agree with measurements. However, a recent study of thermal transport across an atomically sharp and ultraclean Al-sapphire interface (confirmed by transmission electron microscopy) showed a good agreement between models for TBC and measurements made by TDTR.107 This demonstrates the importance of coupling TBC measurement with detailed characterization of the interface in question. The structure and local chemistry of the interface is expected to significantly impact the value of the measured TBC, such that a model that assumes a perfect interface may not be appropriate. This also provides motivation for the development of methods that can capture the effects of nanoscale structure and chemistry at the interface, such as molecular dynamics and perturbation approaches, since interfaces are rarely perfect in real technology. For example, the interfacial strain scattering approach predicts that interfacial strain fields due to misfit dislocations at a Si-Ge interfaces increase RB by a factor of two compared to the pristine interface.110 
B. Physical mechanisms
Thermal boundary resistance can be induced by many scattering contributions across very different length scales, making phonon-interface scattering an inherently multiscale problem. Each of these scattering contributions influences the transmission probability of a phonon across the interface, which underpins the thermal boundary resistance. Scattering sources can be categorized into elastic and inelastic processes (Fig. 10) and include the following:
Elastic
Acoustic impedance mismatch
Interfacial strain fields (e.g., lattice misfit or dislocation arrays)
Mass density variance (e.g., dislocation cores, point defect mass contrast, alloy/amorphous layer with differing mass density)
Force constant variance (e.g., dislocation cores, bond strength variation due to point defects, alloy/amorphous layer with differing elastic moduli)
Inelastic
Phonon coupling to interfacial vibrational modes
While the acoustic mismatch is fixed for a given material and interface orientation, the other contributions can increase
R
B
and are related to the structure and chemistry of the interface. The interfacial mode coupling is the only scattering source that takes into consideration the dynamical properties of the interface, while all other phenomena can be defined from the standpoint of a static interface.
C. Specularity and length scale considerations
The scattering sources listed above are distinct in the scattering transitions they imply. As depicted in Fig. 13, the modeled phonon transitions range from purely specular to purely diffuse, as fewer components of the momentum are conserved. An analogy can be drawn between the scattering transitions discussed in the context of defect dimensionality (see Fig. 9) and the scattering transitions discussed here. The acoustic mismatch is typically treated as an abrupt, step-function change in acoustic impedance at the interface. The resulting scattering potential cannot impart momentum in the plane of the interface, and as such, the phonon transitions are limited to either specular reflection or transmission.110,118 In other words, the acoustic mismatch scattering potential can be thought of as a planar defect, such that phonons are limited to the phase space depicted in Fig. 9(c). The classical acoustic mismatch model (AMM), an acoustic analog of Snell's law, captures this effect. The AMM evaluates a transmission probability determined by the ratio of acoustic impedances at the interface.14 The other end of the spectrum is fully diffuse scattering, in which phonons lose all memory of their incoming polarization and direction and conserve only energy [see Fig. 9(a)], as assumed in the diffuse mismatch model (DMM). While the AMM assumes an atomically sharp and flat interface, the DMM is consistent with a highly disordered and rough interface. The physical origin of the interface scattering is typically not specified in the DMM. Instead, the scattering probability is set only by the available phase space on either side of the interface (from perturbation theory considerations119) captured by the 3D phonon density of states mismatched for the incoming phonon frequency ω. The AMM and DMM are thought to provide upper and lower bounds on the thermal boundary resistance, but these standard models tend to neglect the structure and properties of the interface itself.120 
The scattering from interfacial dislocation arrays, present at many low-energy grain boundaries and interfaces, sits between these limits of specular and diffuse scattering.110,121 The periodic strain fields induced by the dislocation arrays act as a diffraction grating for phonons, leading to a finite set of allowed transitions.60,63 The dislocation strain field can impart momentum in the direction of periodicity quantized in units of
2
π
/
D
⁠, where D is the dislocation spacing.110,118,122 Since dislocation density can vary with grain boundary type, models that include this form of diffractive scattering capture experimentally and computationally observed trends between thermal boundary resistance and grain boundary angle.109,110,118,123
In reality, different energies and wavelengths of the phonon spectrum are expected to couple to different levels of structure at the boundary. Short-wavelengths phonons will interact with dislocation cores and point defects decorating the boundary,70 while mid-wavelength phonons with wavelengths on the order of the interfacial dislocation spacing D will couple to dislocation strain.124 Finally, very long wavelength phonons will remain agnostic to features local to the boundary and will experience specular scattering due to the acoustic mismatch. In Sec. III we highlight how mid to low frequency acoustic phonons carry a significant amount of energy, indicating the importance of capturing nanoscale structure at the interface as well as far-field effects.
D. Low-T thermal conductivity of polycrystals
The thermal conductivity at low temperatures (⁠
T
≤
θ
D
⁠) contains more information regarding phonon-microstructure scattering than high temperatures (⁠
T
>
θ
D
⁠). At low-T, the mean free path and relaxation time are limited by interactions with microstructural defects rather than other phonons. From Eqs. (4) and (B3), one can find that

Wang et al. demonstrated this effect in nanocrystalline Si and identified that this T2 behavior is best explained by a frequency dependent relaxation time, mean free path, and transmissivity.125 This is in contrast with the highly common “gray model” assumption, which asserts that the mean free path is limited to the grain size and is therefore ω-independent. Hua et al. measured a frequency-dependent transmissivity at Al-Si interfaces,126 demonstrating that this behavior is not limited to homointerfaces (such as grain boundaries). Hua et al. additionally emphasized the importance of non-gray scattering on thermal conductivity through Monte Carlo simulations, showing that the gray model severely underestimates the contribution of long-wavelength phonons to the overall thermal conductivity.127 In original reports the origin of the ω-dependent τ was unknown in detail, and it was suggested that it is related to interfacial roughness.125 Since then, models which treat the interfacial structure in more detail suggest that the ω-dependence arises from the roughness induced by interfacial dislocations (which are well described using bi-crystallography), and that heat carrying phonons most strongly couple to the interfacial strain fields they induce. Kim et al. originally suggested that frequency dependence stemming from dislocation strain scattering provides a likely explanation for the T2 behavior.67 By applying an interfacial perturbation approach to the Read-Shockley dislocation-array model for grain boundaries, this conclusion was found to hold for scattering off a grain boundary defect.118 However, a sharp change in the ω-dependence of the phonon transmissivity is predicted, similar in nature to that measured by Hua et al.,126 when the full dislocation array is considered. This change in ω-dependence stems from a dimensionality crossover effect. Below the crossover frequency, the phonon scatters off of the long range (step-function like) change in elastic properties, and
τ

is frequency independent [planar defect scattering, Fig. 9(c)]. Above the crossover frequency, the phonon scatters off of the interfacial strain field, which arises from the nanoscale features of the interfacial dislocation array, resulting in

E. Thermal boundary resistance models
There exist several general approaches for modeling thermal resistance at an interface. Certain approaches can, by design, omit potentially important physical mechanisms discussed (e.g., nano-structure, strain fields, atomic segregation, disorder). We will first introduce theoretical approaches in increasing level of detail. Then, in Sec. V E 2, we will show how these seemingly separate frameworks can be related.130 
The Landauer-type approach captures all details regarding phonon-interface interactions in a probability of transmission
t

[or
t
(
q
s
)
]. Therefore, any details such as the presence of an amorphous interfacial layer, misfit dislocation strain fields, and the associated interfacial vibrational modes are buried within
t
(
ω
)
⁠.
Another common method is an application of the Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation, which treats the material as a homogeneous solid with a relaxation time that is modified by the additional interfacial scattering through Mattheissen's rule. This approach allows one to treat the interface as a perturbation, which is described by introducing a scattering potential, which is seen by an incoming wave-packet and induces a scattering probability and relaxation time through quantum perturbation theory [Eq. (D1)]. This method assigns a physical mechanism for phonon-interface coupling through the definition of a scattering potential (V), and the modeling results can then be compared to experiment or computational simulation. We call this the interfacial perturbation approach, which can naturally capture nano-scale structural features and transitions from specular to diffuse scattering (i.e., the conservation of phonon momentum within the plane of the interface). This approach has been applied to tilt and twist grain boundaries, semi-coherent interfaces,110 and ferroelectric domain walls.131 
1. Landauer-type models

In practice, Eq. (38) can be useful when characterizing the grain size dependence of thermal conductivity133–135 for material systems where a bulk series resistance model has strong physical significance, such as the presence of a thick grain boundary phase. However, this picture is not expected to hold for phonons that have a wavelength comparable to or longer than the interfacial thickness. Equation (37) recognizes that an interface can be less resistive to low-ω phonons than to high-ω phonons,110 and that phonons at the longest wavelengths (i.e., ultrasound) pass through the interface unperturbed (mean free path larger than Lz).
2. Interfacial perturbation models
The second method introduces the interface as an additional scattering mechanism that can reduce the phonon lifetime. The relaxation time due to this scattering mechanism can be calculated using the scattering theory presented in Sec. IV A. The total thermal resistivity is calculated as the sum of the resistivity due to phonon-phonon scattering and the resistivity due to boundary scattering,

Since this relaxation time is derived by considering perturbations to the crystal Hamiltonian, this method has the capacity to capture materials physics, which may be missed by the classic definitions of transmissivity (e.g., AMM and DMM). In the perturbation theory approach, the effects of defect dimensionality and spatial extent of the scattering potential, as well as the physical origin of the phonon scattering are naturally built into the theoretical framework (e.g., anharmonicity, elastic anisotropy, local changes in atomic mass or interatomic force constants, etc.).
However, the two approaches can be related by equating Eqs. (38) and (39),

and differ no more than 5% across the entire range, which captures most solid-solid interfaces. While intuition might suggest that perturbation theory cannot capture the significant changes in the acoustic medium at grain boundaries and interfaces, the close correspondence shown here suggests that perturbation theory is still predictive.
3. Interfacial modes and MD
Thus far, our discussion of scattering sources has largely assumed that the interface is a static defect. A static interface would lack the dynamical degrees of freedom to absorb or emit energy, and so the scattering processes described so far are elastic. However, atomistic simulations, like the ones described in this section, have revealed that inelastic interactions can play a significant role in thermal boundary conductance
h
B
predictions.136 Inelastic processes occur when bulk vibrational modes couple to interfacial vibrational modes, defined as eigenmodes with large displacements for interfacial atoms, which form due to the higher degree of anharmonicity at the interface relative to the bulk.136–139,181 Their role in interface conductance problems has thus far largely been discerned through molecular dynamics simulations.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, as mentioned in Sec. II B, use classical mechanics to update atom positions and velocities in each time step of the simulation. Unlike the scattering frameworks described previously, individual scattering contributions do not have to be separately modeled or understood in an MD simulation, as they will be naturally captured as long as the harmonic and anharmonic properties of the lattice are well-described by the MD interatomic potentials. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to compute a Kapitza conductance
h
B
directly from the simulation temperature profile once steady state has been established. Much of the currently available data used to understand
h
B
trends between grain boundary type, angle, and orientation stem from MD investigations. Several similar strategies exist for extracting the Kapitza resistance from MD simulations.108,140 One common approach described by Schelling et al.108 involves adding and subtracting energy
Δ
ε
from a thin slab of atoms on either side of the boundary, which fixes the thermal current [j in Eq. (33)]. Then, the temperature discontinuity at the interface is computed from the temperature profile (⁠
Δ
T
⁠) such that the
h
B
can be solved by using Eq. (33).
MD simulations offer many advantages through being a real-space, time-domain technique. For example, using the Green-Kubo modal analysis method, the modal contributions to the atom positions and velocities can be determined, allowing one to then evaluate the modal contributions to the Hardy heat flux operator j.11,26,141 The Green-Kubo formalism can then be applied to evaluate the thermal conductivity from the time correlation of the heat fluxes as

(46)
This time-correlation approach can have major benefits over the phonon gas model when phonon velocities are ill-defined, which tends to occur in highly disordered materials and complex unit cell materials, common in the field of thermoelectrics.141 However, interpreting these simulations can become a challenge since post processing or controlled wave packet simulations142 must be performed to extract mode specific properties.
A similar modal analysis technique has been developed by Gordiz and Henry specifically for interface conductance and is referred to as interface conductance modal analysis (ICMA).136–138 This technique has revealed that, in certain cases, a new set of vibrational eigenmodes, unique to the interface, must be included in the analysis to fully describe the heat flow across the interface. In the case of a Si-Ge heterointerface, the interfacial modes were shown to contribute to heat transfer, increasing the
h
B
relative to the model that excluded these modes.138 A more comprehensive survey of interfaces between different materials has since suggested that interfacial mode coupling may be a unique feature of interfaces between certain structure types, like the diamond cubic lattices of Si and Ge.139 
Finally, an increasingly popular alternative simulation approach is the atomistic Green's function (AGF). As with lattice dynamics (see Sec. II B), AGF is a reciprocal space approach and is useful for studying the spectral dependence of phonon transmission at an interface.142 Physically, the Green's function represents the response of the lattice dynamical equations to an impulse perturbation. The AGF can be applied to the interface scattering problem in a straightforward way by re-framing the system as two contact materials, each described by a separate Green's function, which are then coupled at the interface. The system's dynamical response to the perturbation caused by this coupling is captured by this approach and used to compute a spectral phonon transmission coefficient.143 While this approach is known to perform efficiently in the ballistic regime, anharmonic scattering effects have been notoriously difficult to implement, although developing anharmonic extensions to the AGF is a rapidly progressing initiative.144,182
VI. DISORDERED MATERIALS
In disordered materials, the phonon-gas model is expected to be an incomplete description of vibrational thermal transport.11,28 The broadening and eventual disappearance of diffraction peaks is often used as a structural characterization of disorder. In terms of vibrational properties and thermal conductivity, a key characteristic of disordered or glass-like behavior is the loss of a measurable dispersion relation. However, recent inelastic x-ray scattering and simulation work by Moon et al.145,146 demonstrates that amorphous silicon, a material with no crystal diffraction peaks, supports an acoustic dispersion relation up to 40 meV (well into the thermal phonon energy range), corresponding to wavelengths as short as 6 Å. In contrast, crystalline
Yb
14

11
⁠, which does show diffraction peaks, exhibits no clear acoustic branches above 3 meV, and simulations indicate it conducts primarily through the diffuson channel above room temperature.29 Therefore, in terms of vibrational properties and thermal transport, a material can exhibit characteristics of a glass while structurally exhibiting characteristics of a crystal, and vice versa. These counter-intuitive findings highlight the potential for discovery in disordered materials and how modern experimental and computational techniques are poised to unlock new understanding.
Molecular dynamics has been applied extensively to study disordered materials. The reader is referred to the recent review by DeAngelis et al.11 for an overview. Here, we review analytical models for the glassy/minimum/diffuson-mediated thermal conductivity. Then the history, current work, and future implications of two-channel lattice dynamics and diffuson-channel are discussed. The relationship between these topics is discussed throughout.
A. The “minimum” thermal conductivity
The concept of a minimum thermal conductivity has important implications, since it provides practical limits for technological design. There are several analytical models96,105,147 that attempt to compute the minimum thermal conductivity. Their similarities and differences can be observed by viewing them within a consistent framework

assuming that vibrational energy attempts a jump every half period of oscillation and completes the jump every attempt (probability P = 1).
The differences in analytical models typically arise in the treatment of the jump distance α. The jump distance defined by Cahill and Pohl105 is set to half the vibration wavelength

is given in Eq. (E1). Equation (51) is equivalent to Eq. (3) of Cahill and Pohl.105 In the high temperature limit, Eq. (51) simplifies to96

Since the jump distance (⁠

D

and the mean free path is half of the wavelength, i.e.,
Λ

⁠.
The diffuson-mediated model presented by Agne, Hanus, and Snyder96 does not rely on a well-defined E-q relation like that needed to describe phonon gas transport. Instead, they start from a vibrational density of states picture where a well-defined wavevector is not needed. The model is then developed by supposing all vibrations in the density of states behave as diffusons with a jump distance equal to a characteristic interatomic distance,
α

Through a heuristic correlation of the average frequency of the vibrational density of states with the Debye frequency,

⁠, then
κ

can be recast in the same form as Eq. (51) [see Eq. (18) in Agne et al.96], which has a high temperature limit defined by the speed of sound as

(55)
Comparison of the high temperature limits of the Cahill-Pohl and Agne-Hanus-Snyder models [Eqs. (52) and (55)] leads to the conclusion that
κ
AHS
is about 37% lower than
κ
CP
on average. This is consistent with the fact that the average oscillator jump distance in the Cahill-Pohl model is ∼20% larger than that used by Agne-Hanus-Snyder. As an estimate of the minimum thermal conductivity, it makes sense to consider the smallest possible jump distance, i.e., the interatomic distance as first noted by Kittel149 and used by Clarke.147 The fact that
κ
CP
is a good predictor of the magnitude of the thermal conductivity of glasses150 is in agreement with the idea that the average length-scale of thermal diffusion should be somewhat higher than the interatomic distance.27 
We note in passing that these minimum thermal conductivity models are for isotropic bulk materials and that thin films and layered or highly anisotropic materials may have additional considerations.151,152
B. The diffuson channel
It is widely accepted that the phonon-gas model is an incomplete description of vibrational thermal conduction, even when considering the harmonic phonon decomposition.26,153 This was first identified by Hardy in 1963, where through definition of the energy-flux operator and its application to the harmonic phonon decomposition the thermal energy flux is represented by a matrix containing diagonal and non-diagonal terms [see Eqs. (3.29)–(3.31) in Hardy26] Before Hardy's work, the phonon-gas model was obtained by considering the phonon modes of a monatomic linear chain, which results in a single acoustic branch shown in the blue box of Fig. 3(a). This 1D lattice naturally misses any effects that may arise due to quasi-degeneracy16 [shown as red shading in Fig. 3(a)], since only one branch exists. When Hardy derived the thermal energy flux operator in 3D, even a monatomic lattice exhibited three branches at any given q-point (one longitudinal and two transverse modes), and therefore, it became apparent that there is a contribution to thermal conduction due to normal mode mixing (off-diagonal components). Mathematically this is expressed by considering the heat flux and thermal conductivity as a matrix [Fig. 3(b)] with diagonal elements describing phonon modes conducting heat as propagating wave packets (phonon-gas channel) and the non-diagonal elements describing phonons conducting energy diffusely through normal mode mixing (diffuson channel). In relatively simple crystals that are not significantly anharmonic, Hardy correctly argued that the non-diagonal contributions will be negligible compared to the diagonal contributions.
Decades later, Allen and Feldman153,154 studied amorphous Si and
Si
x
Ge
1
−

⁠, by considering the harmonic interatomic forces of a relaxed amorphous-like unit cell structure that obeyed periodic boundary conditions. Therefore, phonon mode decomposition could be applied. However, their structure contained up to 1000 atoms per unit cell and so the phonon band structure can be considered an extreme case of band folding [green box in Fig. 3(a)], such that the Brillouin zone integration could be performed by sampling a single q-point (Γ).
The extension of Allen and Feldman's methodology to explore the vibrational character of crystalline solids has been a development over the last decade.155,156 The ability to quantify the vibrational character of a particular phonon mode has seen marked improvements from the simple participation ratio metric used by Allen and Feldman.11 The basic classification scheme is to use the spatial correlation of phonon eigenvectors for each vibrational mode. Propagaons, which correspond to the typical picture of a cyclic spatial displacement field defined by the wavevector, have eigenvectors that are highly correlated throughout all atoms in the solid. Diffusons represent phonon modes that are also extended across many atoms, but each atom vibrates in a different direction (defined by the eigenvector) that may even appear random. This is why the wavevector is no longer a reasonable descriptor for these vibrations. Locons are phonons that are spatially localized, which is to say that these are movements of an atom (or a few atoms) that are essentially uncorrelated with the movement of its neighbors.
From both molecular dynamics simulations (e.g., using Green-Kubo modal analysis25) and lattice dynamics calculations15,16,157,158 it has been possible to quantify the relative contributions of the phonon gas and diffuson channels to thermal conductivity. There have also been various constructions of two-channel thermal transport models from analytical theories.30,53,159–162

which describes the transfer of thermal energy C between two vibrational modes s and
s

at a specific q. In general, however, coupling between modes at different q may also be considered.29 The velocity matrices v determine the rate of energy transfer and depend on the eigenvectors of the two modes such that
v

τ

v

and

There is tremendous potential to leverage MD and two-channel LD techniques in materials design. However, more experimental and computational experiments are required to guide intuition and uncovered design principles. Currently the predictive design of vibrational character through composition, defects, and materials processing is in its infancy. Mechanisms to reduce thermal conductivity often result in a larger proportion of diffuson-channel conduction. It is known that this can be accomplished by disordering the atomic structure (e.g., amorphous materials27) and is also expected for materials with high anharmonicity.15 To further reduce thermal conductivity, however, it is desirable to reduce transport within the diffuson channel itself. This may be accomplished by increasing the spectral distribution of modes and isolating them energetically as identified in a recent study on Yb14(Mn,Mg)Sb11.29 The development of other design paradigms for the diffuson channel will be crucial for next generation ultralow thermal conductivity materials. Additionally, the impact of vibrational character, and its relationship with ionic transport in solids, is mostly unexplored and is an entirely new direction of research.163,164

Additionally, there are databases containing IFCs of many compounds to second and even third order.168 It seems that for many materials treating U to 3rd order is sufficient.4 In some very anharmonic materials and at high temperatures, fourth order IFCs can become important and play the role of renormalizing the phonon dispersion relation and opening up additional scattering phase space.169–171

1. Harmonic vibrational states
Harmonic vibrational eigenstates (phonons) can be mathematically defined by solving the atomic equations of motion, assuming harmonic coupling between all atoms (read

(⁠
ℏ
is the reduced Plank constant and ω is the phonon angular frequency). The phonon dispersion relation is, in essence, a Fourier transform of the interatomic force constants weighted by the atomic masses, and naturally contains information of lattice symmetries.

Here we describe computation of

Isaeva et al. define terms explicitly in this form, and the reader is referred to Eq. 9 of Ref. 16. Here, we cast the theory provided by Simoncelli et al. into the same form as Eq. (A10). The quantity contained within the sum can be thought of as a matrix with rows and columns designating the mode index, s and
s

[Fig. 3(b)] at a given q. The diagonal elements sum together giving the phonon-gas channel
κ

[Eq. (B1)].
The velocity matrix can be written as a matrix element containing the gradient of the dynamical matrix, which is commonly used to compute the phonon-gas channel group velocity

2. Spectral
Depending on the complexity of the system of interest, it may be desirable or necessary to work with spectral models for
κ
pg
where each phonon property is expressed as a function of frequency, ω, rather than mode-specific models where each mode
q
s
in the Brillouin zone is considered independently. However, it is important to understand how mode-specific and spectral models are related, particularly when constructing multi-scale thermal transport models. In this section, we start with a mode-specific treatment [Eq. (B1)] and demonstrate how it can be reduced to a spectral model [Eq. (4)]. Additionally, we summarize common analytical expressions for the dispersion relation, heat capacity, and phonon-phonon relaxation time.
a. From mode-specific data
The quantities present in Eq. (B1) can be readily computed using ab initio based lattice dynamics, and the results for a perfect, infinite (i.e., no crystal boundary scattering) Si crystal are shown in Figs. 4(a), 4(c), and 4(e).
In Eq. (B1), we define the spectral phonon heat capacity as
C
(
ω
)
=
∑
q
s
C
s
(
q
)
δ
(
ω

and the average group velocity and relaxation time at a given frequency

)
.
(B5)
Note that by omitting the Cartesian index in
v
s
(
q
)
we are implicitly referring to the magnitude of the group velocity of phonon mode
q
s
⁠. Since
∑
q
s
δ
(
ω

ω
(
q
s
)
)
=
g
(
ω
)
,
(B6)
is the phonon density of states (pDOS), Eqs. (B4) and (B5) are simply pDOS weighted averages of
v
s
(
q
)
and
τ
s
(
q
)
⁠. There are several ways to execute Eqs. (B4) and (B5) computationally. In Fig. (4) the δ-functions are approximated as Gaussian distributions using uniform Brillouin zone mesh sampling.
b. From dispersion relation approximations
We now wish to reduce the mode-specific model given in Eq. (B1) into a spectral model given in Eq. (4), which can be computed using dispersion relations and semi-empirical expressions for τ.
We will examine the ij = zz component and for brevity consider three degenerate branches. Therefore, we introduce a factor of 3 and drop the s subscript. We start by converting the sum over q into an integral

⁠, and
x

⁠. The lower case

is essentially the same as

instead of the factor

3. Dispersion relation approximations
The Debye approximation simply assumes all phonons have a group velocity equal to the material's speed of sound
v
S
⁠. It is common to also make the isotropic approximation, such that the speed of sound used is the isotropic speed of sound and ω is therefore only a function of the magnitude of q,
ω
(
q
)
=
v
S
q
,
for
 0
<
q
<
q
max
,
(B16)
where
q

=

)
1
/
3
and
ω
max
=

v
S
q

/
π
⁠. Another common dispersion approximation is the Born-von Karman dispersion relation
ω
(
q
)
=
ω
max
sin
(
π
q
2
q
max
)
.
(B17)
Here,
V
at
is the volume per atom, and N is the number of atoms in the primitive unit cell. Since
q
max
is determined using the volume of the primitive unit cell (⁠
V
at
N
⁠), this thermal transport model only considers acoustic phonons. If
V
at
is substituted for
V
at
N
in the equation for
q
max
⁠, the number of modes considered in the model equals total number of vibrational modes, acoustic plus optical. Equations (B16) and (B17) can be used to compute the group velocity (⁠
v
g
=
d
ω
/
d
q
⁠) and phase velocity
v
p
=
ω
/
q
⁠.
4. Phonon-gas thermal conductivity at high-T
Here we solve for an analytical expression for the phonon thermal conductivity at high-T. The spectral heat capacity given in Eq. (B14), at high temperatures (⁠

APPENDIX C: DETAILS FOR Si PERFECT CRYSTAL EXAMPLE
The phonon energy, group velocity, and relaxation times in Figs. 4(d) and 4(e) were sampled on a dense 30 × 30×30 uniform q-mesh throughout the Brillouin zone. The length of the horizontal dash-type data points in Fig. 4(a) visually represent the resolution of q-meshing. Keep in mind that
τ
s
(
q
)
is not defined at the Γ-point (⁠
q
=
0
⁠) and is set to zero. Therefore, the Brillouin zone integration is approximated by a q-mesh sampling procedure where the lower bound is not computed. The interatomic force constants (IFCs) used for Fig. 4 and Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) were obtained from the almaBTE database.168 Thermal conductivity accumulation calculations presented in Fig. 6(c) used Si harmonic IFCs from Ref. 173 with Gaussian quadrature sampling of the Brillouin zone in Cartesian coordinates and separately in spherical coordinates with similar number of integration sampling points.
APPENDIX D: ELASTIC DEFECT SCATTERING
In this section, we derive analytical expressions for phonon scattering off of a perturbation
H

to the harmonic lattice Hamiltonian
H
0
=
T
+
U
2
nd
⁠, where the total Hamiltonian is given as
H
=
H
0
+
H
′
⁠. For intrinsic phonon-phonon scattering,
H
′
comes from anharmonic terms in the interatomic potential (e.g.,
U
3
rd
⁠). For phonon defect scattering, it is common to represent the perturbation as a spatially varying scattering potential function
V
(
r
)
⁠, which can be understood as perturbing H through T (atomic mass or density fluctuations),
U
2
nd
(fluctuations in elastic constants or IFCs), and/or
U
3
rd
(strain fields). The probability of scattering per unit time of a phonon is given by Fermi's Golden Rule as174

(D1)
For elastic defect scattering, an incident phonon q interacts with the defect and scatters into
q
′
of the same energy. Therefore, the initial state in Eq. (D1) is simply a phonon in state q,
|
i

=

q

⁠, and the final is one in state
q

,

f

⁠. The change in energy of the system is then given by
Δ
E
=
E
q
−
E
q

⁠, where
E
q

ω
q
is the energy of a phonon with wavevector q. For simplicity, we suppress phonon branch index, since that does not affect the central point of our argument, which can be seen by thinking of the perturbation in terms of a scattering potential
V
(
r
)
⁠. In  Appendices A 1–A 3, we will derive
V
(
r
)
from the real-space lattice perturbation induced by point, line, and planar defects. For these examples, it is convenient to think of the crystal as a rectilinear brick with sides Lx, Ly, Lz in the x, y, and z directions with volume

(D2)
The object of ultimately greater interest than the scattering probability is the phonon relaxation time,
τ
(
q
)
⁠, and its inverse the phonon scattering rate,
Γ
(
q
)
=
τ
(
q
)
−
1
⁠. To find these, we must integrate
W
q
,
q
′
over all possible final phonon wavevectors. In the definition of the relaxation time, a forward scattering suppression factor
(
1
−
q
̂
·
q

′
)
is introduced into the integral over
q
′
⁠, with
q
̂
and
q
̂
′
being unit vectors parallel to q and
q
′
⁠. Its presence can be appreciated by considering the forward scattering process where
q
=
q

⁠. Such a transition has no consequence to the system, so forward scattering contributions to
Γ
(

are suppressed via the presence of
(

)
⁠. (See page 326 of Ashcroft and Mermin174 for more details on the forward scattering suppression factor.) Therefore, we have

The role of the dimensionality of the scattering defect can now be addressed. It is useful to discuss the different dimensionalities separately and begin in the middle with a linear defect,

1. One-dimensional defects
Suppose the defect is a linear object parallel to the z direction, so that
V

(D4)
is a function only of x and y. The position integral in the matrix element then simplifies to

The two δ-functions in the integral now represent conservation of energy and wavevector parallel to the defect. Therefore, scattering from a defect of this type is specular in the z-direction,
Q
z
=

−
q

⁠. We can see this by assuming an isotropic phonon spectrum,
E
q
=
E

q
⁠, in which the energy
E

depends on
q
=

only. With the phonon group and phase velocities defined as

(D11)
Beginning here, we will omit the absolute value sign around
v
g
as the group velocity is always positive for our treatment. However, real phonon dispersion relations can have a negative
v
g
and in this case the absolute value is required. We stress that the assumption of isotropy in no way diminishes the generality of the dimensional arguments, and is made so as to not encumber the analysis with inessential detail. In spherical polar coordinates, the second δ-function [in conjunction with
δ
(
q

q

)
] reads
δ
(

=

APPENDIX E: MEASUREMENTS OF THE SPEED OF SOUND AND DEBYE TEMPERATURE
1. Debye temperature
It is important to note the energy scale of phonons in a system. For reference, the maximum phonon frequency of Si is approximately
65
meV
⁠, where
k
B
T
=
25
meV
at room temperature (⁠
T
=
300
K
⁠). Therefore, all the phonons in Si will be significantly thermally populated at around 2.5 times room temperature. This is one intrinsic material property that the Debye temperature (⁠
θ
D
⁠) strives to quantify: the temperature at which all vibrations in a material are active (⁠
θ
D
=
660
K
in Si). There are many ways to measure and compute
θ
D
⁠, and one should only directly compare the magnitude of
θ
D
values, which are determined by a consistent method. Several methods for quantifying
θ
D
are reviewed here. Important relations are
k
B
θ
D
=
ℏ
ω
D
=
ℏ
v
S
(
6
π
2
V
)
1
/
3
,
(E1)
where
ω
D
is the Debye frequency,
v
S
is the average speed of sound [Eq. (E2)], and V is the volume per atom. If the volume per unit cell is used for V instead, one might call this an “acoustic Debye temperature/frequency” since only acoustic modes are considered.
2. Pulse-echo ultrasound
The speed of sound in a material can be readily and accurately measured by a pulse-echo method where a piezoelectric transducer coupled to a sample sends an initial stress-wave pulse, and then acts as receiver measuring the echoed ultrasound reflection from the other side of the sample (Fig. 15).175 When no preferred orientation is observed, say by X-ray analysis, randomly oriented polycrystals can be treated as elastically isotropic, particularly for dense samples with grain sizes sufficiently smaller than the ultrasonic wavelength. The time-delay,
t
d
⁠, between subsequent reflections must be determined by maximizing the cross-correlation [Fig. 15(c)] of the two reflections as follows. If
A
n
(
t
)
is the amplitude of reflection n, then
∑
t
A
n
(
t
)
A
n
+
1
(
t
−
t
d
)
is maximized by varying
t
d
⁠. This corresponding value of
t
d
along with the sample thickness, h, is then used to calculate the speed of sound,
v
L
,
T
=
2
h
/
t
d
⁠. Table honey with low water content acts as a nice coupling agent for both longitudinal and transverse acoustic waves. Its viscoelastic properties make it surprisingly effective at transferring acoustic energy. Crystalbond or superglue can also be used. A typical waveform should contain over four reflections (3 time-delay measurements), and the measurements from a minimum of three waveforms (corresponding to 9 individual speed of sound measurements) can be averaged. Measurements having a standard deviation of less than 1% of the mean are common. The largest error in this technique is the measurement of the sample thickness, and if care is taken to ensure the sample faces are parallel and a micrometer is used to measure the sample thickness,
<
1
%
characterization related error is achievable. The average speed of sound that is commonly used for transport modeling is calculated as98

The Debye temperature can be calculated using
v
S
and the volume per atom V by Eq. (E1).
3. Low temperature heat capacity
To verify speed of sound measurements via pulse-echo ultrasound, low-T heat capacity can be used.
It is possible to determine the so-called Debye level, which is defined as
β
→
C
p
/
T
3
in the
T
→
0
K limit, where
C
p
is the heat capacity at constant pressure. β is the horizontal plateau that is observed when the low frequency linear dispersion (i.e., speed of sound) makes up the vibrational density of states [i.e.,
g
(
ω
)
∝
ω
2
] and is related to the Debye temperature through the relation
θ
D
=
(
12
5
π
4
N
R
)
1
/
3
β
−
1
/
3
,
(E3)
where β has units of J mol−1 K−4, N is the number of atoms per formula unit, and R is the gas constant. The results of low-T heat capacity have provided excellent verification of the pulse-echo experiments in many systems including PbTe,95 SnTe,176 and the Mg2(Sb,Bi)3 system.177 
4. High temperature heat capacity
The Debye temperature as obtained from speed of sound and low temperature heat capacity is really a probe of the low frequency acoustic phonons. Therefore, Debye frequency measured via those methods are not always a good estimate for the true maximum vibrational frequency of the solid.96,178 Another interpretation of the Debye temperature is the temperature at which the heat capacity begins to saturate at high temperatures. In the Debye model for constant volume heat capacity, this corresponds to the temperature when the heat capacity reaches ∼95% of the Dulong-Petit value of 3
k
B
per atom. As an estimate for the true maximum of the phonon density of states, this definition of the Debye temperature holds even for constant pressure heat capacity. Alternatively, the Debye temperature could be used as a fitting parameter in the constant pressure heat capacity polynomial proposed by Agne et al.,177

Equation (21) is a factor of 3 smaller than Klemens' expression, Eq. 65 of Ref. 60 (which is given for
θ
=
π
/
2
⁠). This may be due to differences in assumptions regarding mode conversion when computing the scattering phase space. If one assumes a phonon can scatter into any three of the acoustic branches, then the phase space contribution is
3
g
2
d
⁠. Since in full detail the matrix element will contain a dot product between the incident phonon eigenvector (polarization vector) and the scattered phonon eigenvector, we use
g
2
d
