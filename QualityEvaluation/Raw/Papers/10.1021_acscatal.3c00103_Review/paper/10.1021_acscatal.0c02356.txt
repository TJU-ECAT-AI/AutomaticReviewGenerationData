Abstract
A variety of Sn-containing Beta zeolites possessing framework or extraframework Sn sites were prepared by a two-step postsynthesis procedure. The nature of these Sn species was systematically investigated by several approaches, including DRIFT, XPS, UV–vis, and solid-state 119Sn MAS NMR spectroscopy. The subtle distinctions of the Lewis acidic features between the framework and extraframework Sn sites were identified via acetone-2-13C, TMPO, and NH3 adsorption, studied via 13C, 31P, and 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy, respectively. Two types of Lewis acid sites (LAS) have been observed and attributed to (i) framework Sn sites and (ii) extraframework SnOx clusters confined inside the pores or cages of [Si]Beta zeolite, both exhibiting Lewis acid properties. The Lewis acidic characteristics of the extraframework Sn sites were found to depend on the cluster sizes. The confined SnOx clusters with sizes of 0.5–2 nm possess Lewis acidic characteristics similar to those of the framework Sn species and also exhibit a comparable catalytic activity in the Baeyer-Villiger (B-V) oxidation of cyclohexanone and cyclohexene oxide hydration. With an increase in size of the SnOx clusters to over 2 nm, the Lewis acidic characteristics of the extraframework Sn species gradually weaken or even disappear.

1. Introduction
As types of important catalysts, Lewis acids exhibit excellent activity in the production of many chemicals. In comparison with homogeneous catalysts, solid Lewis acids are easy to recover and reusable and consequently have aroused broad attention. (1−3) The introduction of Sn-containing Beta zeolite made a great breakthrough in the utilization of solid Lewis acids in aqueous-phase reactions. (4,5) Microporous Sn-Beta zeolite with tetrahedrally incorporated framework Sn species in the siliceous BEA-type zeolite has exhibited remarkable activity in numerous reactions: e.g., the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley, (6,7) Bayer–Villiger, (8) aldol condensation, (9,10) and Diels–Alder reactions. (11) In addition, Sn-Beta zeolites have also been utilized in various reactions of carbohydrate conversion: e.g., sugar isomerization, (12−16) epimerization, (17) and Cannizzaro-type reactions. (18−20)
Inspired by the widespread utilization of Sn-Beta zeolites, researchers have extensively evaluated a large number of procedures for Sn-Beta zeolite syntheses, (3,19,21−23) but the essence of the Sn active sites in these samples is still lacking in understanding. (24), (25) As is well known, two kinds of tetrahedral Sn species are present in Sn-Beta zeolites: i.e., the open and closed Sn sites. (5,26,27) To determine the nature of the active LAS, several techniques have been utilized for investigating the different Sn centers. Among these methods, the solid-state NMR technique is one of the most reliable tools, which allows the observation of two different 119Sn solid-state NMR signals at around −424 and −445 ppm attributed to the open and closed Lewis acidic Sn sites, respectively. Upon hydration, these signals could shift to −685 and −700 ppm assigned to octahedral Sn sites, owing to the hydrated form of tetrahedral Sn sites. (15,28) In addition, the extraframework Sn species can also be easily identified by this approach, since SnOx clusters cause signals at ca. -605 ppm. However, the application of this method is limited because of the low natural abundance level of the 119Sn isotope (8.5%), which requires an experiment time of several days for each 119Sn MAS NMR measurement. (29) To improve the detection sensitivity for Sn-Beta zeolites, dynamic nuclear polarization surface-enhanced NMR spectroscopy (DNP-SENS) was recently employed, (30−32) and the sensitivity could be enhanced by 28–75 times. In addition, according to DNP-SENS NMR spectroscopy, multiple 119Sn NMR signals due to Sn sites at the different T-sites of Beta zeolite could also be determined. (31,32) The recent results of Ivanova et al. indicate that the utilization of different CPMG NMR methods could give six different 119Sn NMR signals within the range of −420 to −447 ppm assigned to Sn atoms in individual T-site positions. (33) According to the probe molecule adsorption and 119Sn MAS NMR spectroscopy, the essence of different Sn active species and their activity can also be assessed. (34) The Lewis acidity of tetrahedral Sn species in Beta zeolites could also be determined by 15N pyridine and TMPO probe molecules and the corresponding 15N and 31P MAS NMR spectra. (35,36)
Due to their ease of use, UV–vis and XPS spectroscopy are often applied to investigate the framework and extraframework Sn species in Sn-containing zeolites. (3,16,19,21,37−43) UV–vis spectroscopy can rapidly evaluate the chemical environment of Lewis acidic metal sites in zeolites, but numerous spectra of similar samples given in the literature have often generated misunderstandings. (25) On the other hand, although XPS is generally utilized to compare the framework Sn and bulk SnO2, the presence of SnOx clusters cannot be specifically discriminated. (25) In addition, DRIFT has also been frequently utilized to assess the Sn substitution into the zeolite framework for the postsynthesized Sn-Beta. For the postsynthesized Sn-Beta, the introduction of Sn sites is related to the evolution of the silanol groups generated from the dealumination. (3,19,21,41) Our recent results indicate that the extraframework Cu, Zn, and Y clusters confined in dealuminated H-Beta zeolite can also lead to the disappearance of the silanol groups at hydroxyl nests and exhibit characteristics of LAS. (44−47) Furthermore, extraframework SnO2 clusters have recently been proven to possess Lewis acidity (5) and appear to be reactive in glucose to fructose conversion when they are confined in Beta zeolite pores. (15) Therefore, different approaches may occasionally give conflicting results for the same materials, and a more systematic investigation of framework and extraframework Sn sites in Sn-containing Beta zeolites is still missing but is crucial for constructing the structure–activity relationships.
The aim of the present study is to elucidate the essence of the Lewis acidic Sn species including framework and extraframework Sn sites in Sn-containing Beta zeolites via several complementary spectroscopic methods. A variety of Sn-containing Beta zeolites possessing framework or extraframework Sn sites were prepared by a two-step postsynthesis strategy, and the nature of Sn species was investigated by several approaches, including DRIFT, UV-vis, XPS, and 119Sn MAS NMR spectroscopy. In addition, acetone-2-13C, TMPO, and NH3 adsorption, together with 13C, 31P, and 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy, respectively, were investigated to identify the subtle distinctions of the Lewis acidic features between the framework and extraframework Sn sites. We find for the first time that the characteristics of extraframework SnOx species highly depend on their sizes. Tiny extraframework SnO2 clusters confined in [Si]Beta give similar UV–vis and XPS spectra as well as Lewis acidic characteristics like those of the framework Sn sites and also exhibit a comparable catalytic activity in the B-V oxidation of cyclohexanone and cyclohexene oxide hydration. In contrast, large extraframework SnO2 clusters exhibit the same characteristics as those of bulky SnO2 clusters.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Preparation of Sn-Containing Zeolites
Sn-containing Beta zeolite samples were prepared via a two-step post-synthesis strategy. First, the siliceous Beta zeolite was produced by the dealumination of H-Beta (nSi/nAl = 13.5) in concentrated nitric acid (13 M). Subsequently, different amounts of Sn species were introduced into the [Si]Beta zeolites by dry impregnation. The final samples were labelled as X%Sn-Beta-I, where X denotes the weight content of the Sn metal. More experimental details are provided in the Supporting Information.
For comparison, X%Sn-Beta-II catalysts were also prepared by the same strategy as that for X%Sn-Beta-I except for the omission of a vacuum calcination process. 5%Sn-Beta-III was prepared via incipient wetness impregnation of dealuminated [Si]Beta utilizing SnCl4 as the Sn precursor, followed by treatment at 473 K and calcination at 823 K for 6 h in an air atmosphere. In addition, [Si]Beta-supported tin oxide, i.e. SnO2/[Si]Beta, was also prepared by mixing the dealuminated [Si]Beta with SnO2 oxide and thereafter the mixture was calcined at 823 K for 6 h.
2.2. Sample Characterization and In Situ Measurements
The physicochemical properties of the as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The precise weight loadings of Sn species were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The changes of hydroxyl groups in H-Beta, dealuminated [Si]Beta, and Sn-containing Beta samples were investigated by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy, while the chemical environment and the nature of Sn species within the [Si]Beta zeolite were verified by diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and solid-state 119Sn MAS NMR spectroscopy. The nature of Sn species and the changes in Sn coordinations in the Sn-containing Beta zeolites during the hydration and dehydration process was monitored by in situ UV–vis spectroscopy and 119Sn MAS NMR spectroscopy. The Lewis acidic features of the framework and extraframework Sn sites in Sn-containing Beta zeolites were qualitatively and quantitatively identified via acetone-2-13C, TMPO, and NH3 adsorption, studied via 13C, 31P, and 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy, respectively. More equipment parameters and experimental details of the aforementioned characterizations are provided in the Supporting Information.
2.3. Catalytic Evaluation
The B-V oxidation of cyclohexanone was performed in a round-bottomed glass flask (25 mL). The reactant solution (0.33 M cyclohexanone diluted in 1,4-dioxane; 5 mL) was first mixed with 20 mg of Sn-containing Beta zeolites. Thereafter, the mixture was heated and kept at 363 K for 15 min, followed by adding H2O2 solution with vigorous stirring. After reactions for different times, the reaction products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu 2010) with a FID detector and a Agilent HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). Toluene was utilized as the internal standard.
The cyclohexene oxide hydration was also carried out in a round-bottom flask (25 mL). First, 10 mmol of cyclohexene oxide and 0.1 g of Sn-containing Beta zeolite catalyst were mixed in 20 mmol of H2O with vigorous stirring. After different reaction times at 313 K, the products were analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu 2010) with a FID detector and a Agilent HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). Octanol was utilized as the internal standard.
More than 95% carbon balance was achieved for all of the aforementioned experiments, and the reaction rates of the B-V oxidation of cyclohexanone and cyclohexene oxide hydration over different Sn-containing catalysts were estimated on the basis of the initial conversion with a reaction time of 1 h.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Structural Characterization of the as-Prepared Sn-Containing Zeolites
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of H-Beta and the post-treated samples under study. Typical diffraction peaks of Beta zeolite occur for all of the samples, suggesting that the dealumination treatment and incorporation of Sn species did not cause structural changes in Beta zeolite, in line with previous reports. (3) Except for the mixed SnO2/[Si]Beta, no obvious characteristic diffraction peaks of Sn species were detected in the Sn-containing zeolites, because of the homogeneous dispersion of Sn species. During the processes of dealumination and introduction of Sn species, the contraction/expansion of the Beta zeolite framework occurs, causing slight changes in the diffraction peak of (302) at 2θ = 22.5°. (48,49) After dealumination, an obvious decrease in d302 spacing associated with the 2θ value, from 3.941 Å (H-Beta, 2θ = 22.54°) to 3.897 Å ([Si]Beta, 2θ = 22.80°), occurs (Figure 1), confirming the contraction of the [Si]Beta matrix. After Sn introduction, the d302 spacing gradually increases with an enhancement in the Sn loadings: e.g., from 3.897 Å for [Si]Beta (2θ = 22.80°) to 3.927 Å for 5%Sn-Beta-I and then to 3.939 Å for 10%Sn-Beta-I. This indirectly demonstrated the expansion of the BEA framework, revealing that the Sn species was successfully introduced into the Beta zeolite framework. This is in good agreement with the N2 adsorption/desorption results, where no obvious differences in BET surface areas and micropore volumes occur for the Sn-containing zeolites (Table 1).

On the basis of our previous studies, obvious changes of the silanol groups in the Beta zeolites could be observed during the dealumination and introduction of metal heteroatoms. (3,50)Figure 2 presents the DRIFT spectra of hydroxyl groups on the calcined samples under study. The dominant band at 3735 cm–1 with a weak shoulder at 3745 cm–1 occurs on H-Beta. The former band is attributed to internal Si–OH groups from small defects, while the latter band is assigned to external Si–OH groups from zeolite surfaces and large defects. (42,51) Another obvious band at 3605 cm–1 also occurs due to bridging hydroxyl group Si–OH–Al. (52) After dealumination with concentrated HNO3 solution, the 3605 cm–1 band disappears owing to full dealumination, in good agreement with the ICP results (Si/Al > 1800). Simultaneously, the band at 3735 cm–1 shifts to about 3730 cm–1 with an increased intensity (due to Si–OH groups) and a new broad band around 3510 cm–1 also appears, indicating the formation of more defect sites on Beta zeolite. Specifically, the appearance of the band at approximately 3510 cm–1 demonstrates the formation of hydroxyl nests in the dealuminated [Si]Beta zeolite, according to a previous assignment. (3) The internal Si–OH groups and the hydroxyl nests are frequently employed as the anchoring sites for Sn species, and significant decreases in the intensities of the bands at 3510 and 3735 cm–1 occur for the samples upon the introduction of Sn species, indicating that the Sn precursors interact with the internal silanols. In contrast, for the mechanically mixed SnO2/[Si]Beta, no obvious changes occur in the DRIFT spectra, indicating that tin oxides are the main species within the dealuminated [Si]Beta matrix without reaction toward the Si–OH groups, in line with the XRD results. According to our previous studies, (44) these observations indicate that catalytic microreactors with the confined Sn species have been established through the postsynthesis strategy. Namely, Sn precursors would decompose and react with the Si–OH groups produced by the dealumination after calcination. In this manner, Sn species can be introduced into the pores or cages of [Si]Beta zeolite, to construct the confined microreactors. However, the incorporation of Sn sites into the BEA framework and the coordination states of Sn species require further identification.

3.2. Characterization of the Sn Sites
The coordination states of Sn species in the Sn-containing Beta samples were first studied by UV–vis spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 3, the mixed SnO2/[Si]Beta and 5%Sn-Beta-III show a broad UV–vis band centered at around 285 nm and with a large shoulder expanding until 300 nm, owing to the extraframework SnO2 species. However, the absence of XRD diffraction peaks due to the bulk SnO2 in 5%Sn-Beta-III (Figure 1) indicates that the Sn species are well dispersed within the [Si]Beta matrix in the form of small SnO2 clusters. For Sn-Beta-I and Sn-Beta-II, however, strong UV–vis bands due to the tetrahedral coordination framework Sn sites appears at ca. 207 nm, and the intensities of these bands are obviously enhanced with an increase in Sn loading. In addition, a very weak shoulder at about 250 nm attributed to extraframework SnO2 species occur on Sn-Beta-I, the intensity of which obviously increases with an increase in Sn loading. This indicates that the Sn species in Sn-Beta-I mainly exist as the tetrahedral coordination framework Sn sites and only a very small amount of Sn species are present as extraframework SnO2, which can be well supported by XPS results (vide infra). Furthermore, a large shoulder at about 210–225 nm with two bumps occurs for Sn-Beta-II. This broad shoulder might also be assigned to tetrahedral Sn species but exhibits electronic properties different from those responsible for the band at 207 nm. (42) However, the obvious bumps appearing in the range of 210–225 nm may be due to the different tetrahedral Sn species or a bad signal to noise ratio of the UV–vis instrument. Further in situ UV–vis measurements clearly indicate that only two obvious bands at 207 and 224 nm without any bumps (vide infra; see Figure 4b) occur for dehydrated Sn-Beta-II. Therefore, the small bumps occur in the UV–vis spectra (Figure 3) might be due to the bad signal to noise ratio of the UV–vis instrument. For 5%Sn-Beta-III, a weak band at around 207 nm, due to tetrahedrally coordinated Sn, is also observed, indicating that small amounts of Sn species are also incorporated into the BEA framework through wetness impregnation.

As Sn-Beta zeolite catalysts have an excellent tolerance to water, the effect of water on the nature of Sn species has attracted broad attention. Therefore, the changes in the coordination behavior of Sn species upon hydration and dehydration were further studied via in situ UV–vis spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 4, upon hydration, a red shift of the band at 207 nm toward higher wavelengths with a maximum absorbance at ca. 224 nm occurs for 5%Sn-Beta-I and 5%Sn-Beta-II. Additionally, a new band at about 275–285 nm occurs on 5%Sn-Beta-II upon hydration. Bands at around 270 nm have been previously assigned to extraframework SnO2 species. However, the disappearance of these signals after dehydration rules out this assignment. Upon dehydration, the bands at 224 nm also shift back to about 207 nm. These results indicate that the new bands occurring at 224 and 275–285 nm for 5%Sn-Beta-I and 5%Sn-Beta-II, respectively, observed after hydration should be attributed to the hydrated forms of isolated SnIV species with high coordination numbers such as Sn(O)x(OH)y(H2O)z. (16,42) For 5%Sn-Beta-III prepared via incipient wetness impregnation, the broad band at around 285 nm is nearly unaffected upon both hydration and dehydration (Figure 4c). This indicates the formation of small SnO2 agglomerates on 5%Sn-Beta-III, (16,25) which are unreactive toward water.
The XPS technique is able to analyze the surface metal oxidation states and their proximal environment and thus has always been utilized to investigate the existing states of Sn species in Sn-containing zeolites. In Figure 5, two dominant signals at 487.9 and 496.4 eV attributed to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoelectrons of tetrahedral Sn species (17,41) occur in the Sn 3d XPS of the calcined 5%Sn-Beta-I and 5%Sn-Beta-II. In contrast, two main signals at 486.0 and 494.5 eV, assigned to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoelectrons of octahedrally coordinated extraframework Sn species appear for 5%Sn-Beta-III. These results clearly indicate that the Sn species in Sn-Beta-I and Sn-Beta-II samples prepared via the dry impregnation method are mainly tetrahedrally coordinated in the BEA framework. However, in a Sn-Beta-III sample prepared via wetness impregnation, SnO2 groups are observed as the main species, in accordance with the UV–vis results. However, the isolated SnIV species occurred in the UV–vis spectra, i.e., the bands at 207 and 225 nm, cannot be distinguished by XPS.

119Sn MAS NMR spectroscopy is an effective tool to obtain structural information on Sn species and the corresponding changes in Sn coordination upon dehydration or hydration. Figure 6 shows the 119Sn MAS NMR spectra obtained for the Sn-containing Beta zeolites along with bulk SnO2 before and after hydration. In the spectrum of the dehydrated Sn-Beta-I samples, a dominant signal of tetrahedral Sn species at ca. −443 ppm with a weak shoulder at −423 ppm is observed. These two signals can be attributed to closed-framework Sn sites with four (Si)O– bonds and open-framework Sn sites with n (Si)O– bonds and 4 – n OH groups (n = 1, 2 3), respectively. (15,28) Upon hydration, these signals disappeared, while a new signal appeared at −689 ppm simultaneously, which corresponds to octahedrally coordinated Sn sites. Such an interconversion of the tetrahedrally coordinated into octahedrally coordinated Sn sites during the hydration process is related to the coordinated water molecules at Sn sites. (53) In contrast, the hydrated Sn-Beta-III and SnO2/[Si]Beta zeolites only show the dominant signals centered at −605 ppm, attributed to the bulk SnO2 (δ119Sn −605 ppm), in line with a previous study. (15) Interestingly, a new signal appears at about −705 ppm for Sn-Beta-II but is absent for Sn-Beta-III and SnO2/[Si]Beta samples upon hydration, which is also assigned to octahedral Sn sites, due to the hydrated form of tetrahedral Sn sites (δ119Sn −423 ppm). (15,21,53) However, this is inconsistent with the present study, as the tetrahedral Sn sites (δ119Sn −423 ppm) are absent in the dehydrated Sn-Beta-II samples and, therefore, should be reconsidered.
Figure 6
Figure 6. 119Sn MAS NMR spectra of dehydrated and hydrated Sn-containing Beta zeolite and SnO2 samples.
According to previous studies, the line broadening of 119Sn MAS NMR signals can reflect their geometric heterogeneities among the octahedral Sn centers. (15) The broad signal (δ119Sn −605 ppm) occurring for the Sn-Beta-II under study indicates the formation of very tiny SnOx clusters, which are confined in the hydroxyl nests. In contrast, the sharp resonance (δ119Sn −605 ppm) reveals the occurrence of large SnO2 particles on Sn-Beta-III and SnO2/[Si]Beta, in line with the UV–vis results, where UV–vis bands for bulk SnO2 were observed. Upon hydration, the very tiny SnOx clusters confined in Sn-Beta-II samples may exhibit characteristics of disturbed tetrahedral Sn species being able to adsorb water molecules, thus leading to the appearance of octahedral Sn sites (δ119Sn −705 ppm), which are absent in Sn-Beta-III and SnO2/[Si]Beta with large SnO2 particles. In addition, the 119Sn MAS NMR signal at −605 ppm can return to −705 ppm after rehydration, confirming the 119Sn MAS NMR signal at −705 ppm originates from the hydration of the octahedral Sn sites at δ119Sn −605 ppm (Figure S2). This may also explain the assignment of the UV–vis band at 224 nm for Sn-Beta-II, which could be due to very tiny SnOx clusters confined in [Si]Beta matrix but exhibiting characteristics of disturbed tetrahedral Sn species. These tiny SnOx clusters show a red shift to higher wavelengths of 275–285 nm in the UV–vis spectra by forming octahedral Sn species upon hydration. In contrast, the band at about 280 nm occurring for Sn-Beta-III, due to bulk SnO2 species, is unreactive toward water. Therefore, we attribute the signal at δ119Sn −605 ppm over Sn-Beta-II to the very tiny SnOx clusters confined in [Si]Beta, which may exhibit the characteristics of disturbed tetrahedral Sn species being able to adsorb water molecules, thus leading to the appearance of octahedral Sn sites (δ119Sn −705 ppm) upon hydration.
The Sn species on different Sn-containing Beta samples were further explored by electron microscopy. The HRTEM and high-resolution HAADF-STEM images of 5% Sn-Beta-I show clear lattice fringes of the [Si]Beta matrix, and very few clusters in the sub-nanometer scale of 0.2–0.5 nm may also occur (Figure 7a and Figures S1 and S3), but with a lower resolution, which could be attributed to the few extraframework Sn sites, as confirmed by XPS and UV–vis results. The corresponding element mapping results clearly indicate that the Sn species are homogeneously dispersed on the support. When these results are integrated with the aforementioned 119Sn MAS NMR results, the HRTEM images reveal that the Sn species are mainly introduced into the Beta zeolite framework and are present as isolated sites on 5% Sn-Beta-I. In contrast, clear bright flecks with diameters of ∼0.5–2 nm are distributed in the image of 5%Sn-Beta-II (highlighted by yellow circles, Figure 7b and Figure S3), indicating the formation of SnOx clusters. This could also be evidenced by the corresponding element mapping results, as an enrichment in Sn species in specific regions is observed. However, for 5%Sn-Beta-III and 5%SnO2/Si-Beta samples, larger Sn-containing particles with sizes of 2–5 and 5–25 could be observed, respectively (Figure 7c,d and Figure S3). These results support the explanation of the broad 119Sn NMR signal at −605 ppm (Figure 6) well: that is, 5%Sn-Beta-II with tiny SnOx clusters gives a broad signal at δ119Sn −605, while 5%Sn-Beta-III and 5%SnO2/Si-Beta containing larger SnO2 particles give sharp signals at δ119Sn −605 ppm.

Summarizing the aforementioned characterization of Sn sites, we come to the conclusion that Sn species exist as framework Sn sites in Sn-Beta-I prepared by the dry impregnation method with the vacuum calcination process. In contrast, for Sn-Beta-II prepared by the dry impregnation method but without the vacuum calcination process, Sn species exist as very tiny extraframework SnOx clusters. However, the tiny extraframework SnOx clusters confined in Sn-Beta-II also exhibit the characteristics of disturbed tetrahedral Sn species and show UV–vis and XPS spectra similar to those for Sn-Beta-I. In contrast, the large extraframework SnO2 particles present in both Sn-Beta-III via the wet impregnation method and the mixed SnO2/Si-Beta, exhibit characteristics similar to those of bulk SnO2 species. This clearly demonstrates that the sophisticated 119Sn MAS NMR technique can clearly discriminate the tetrahedral framework and octahedral extraframework Sn sites and also offer inferences for the sizes of extraframework SnO2 clusters. In contrast, the frequently utilized UV–vis and XPS spectra characterizing local structures of Sn species require an explanation of the spectral features with more imprecision and ambiguity. That is, the framework Sn sites cannot be directly identified solely by these two methods.
3.3. Identification of Lewis Acidity Originating from Sn Sites in Zeolite
Acetone-2-13C is frequently utilized as a solid-state NMR probe molecule to determine the LAS in microporous solid acids. (54−57) The 13C CPMAS NMR spectra of [Si]Beta and Sn-containing Beta after acetone-2-13C loading are shown in Figure 8. A dominant signal (δ13C 209 ppm) assigned to physisorbed acetone-2-13C at nonacidic Si–OH groups occurs for [Si]Beta. Another weak 13C CPMAS NMR signal at 30 ppm is attributed to non-13C-enriched methyl groups of acetone-2-13C. After the Sn species is introduced, new 13C CPMAS NMR signals appeared at approximately 232 ppm for Sn-Beta-I and Sn-Beta-II, indicating the existence of strong LAS. This strong LAS could be due to tetrahedral framework Sn sites in Sn-Beta-I or tiny extraframework Sn clusters confined in Sn-Beta-II, corresponding to the broad 119Sn NMR signals at −443 and −605 ppm (Figure 6), respectively. In addition, the noticeable 13C CPMAS NMR signals at δ13C 75, 105, 158, and 173 ppm resulting from the products of acetone condensation also indirectly indicate the presence of strong LAS. In contrast, for Sn-Beta-III, the signal at δ13C 232 ppm is absent but there is the presence of weak signals at δ13C 75, 105, and 158 ppm, indicating the catalytic conversion of acetone-2-13C at weak LAS. These weak LAS may be due to the large SnO2 particles corresponding to the sharp resonance (δ119Sn −605 ppm) in 119Sn MAS NMR spectra, (5) but with a low dispersion on the surface of [Si]BEA zeolite. The number of these weak LAS is very low on the surface of large SnO2 particles, and therefore, the signal at δ13C 232 ppm is absent. In addition, 13C CPMAS NMR spectra similar to those of [Si]Beta can be observed over the mixed SnO2/[Si]Beta, indicating that no LAS are generated on this sample with bulk SnO2 species.

Interestingly, strong 13C CPMAS NMR signals at about δ13C 211–214 ppm also appeared for Sn-Beta-II and Sn-Beta-III samples, giving a hint that the surface OH groups adsorbed with acetone-2-13C possess a slightly higher acid strength in comparison with the SiOH groups causing the 13C CPMAS NMR signal at 208 ppm in [Si]Beta zeolite. According to previous studies, (58,59) Al species in the vicinity of Si–OH groups can bring about weak Brønsted acid sites (BAS) and exhibit a 13C CPMAS NMR signal at approximately 213 ppm. However, due to the complete dealumination with concentrated HNO3 solution, the presence of aluminum in [Si]Beta zeolite under study can be excluded (Figure S4). In addition, the open-framework metal sites in the vicinity of silanol groups (M–OH···OH–Si) in the metal-doped zeolites can exhibit weak Brønsted acidity, (5,60) which might give rise to 13C MAS NMR signals at about 211–214 ppm. Because of the absence of open-framework Sn sites (δ119Sn −423 ppm) in the Sn-Beta-II samples under study, this assignment must be excluded. Furthermore, if weak BAS were formed in Sn-Beta-II samples, the 1H MAS NMR spectra of samples after ammonia loading should show ammonium signals at 6.4–6.7 ppm associated with BAS, which are absent in our case (vide infra). Considering the presence of tiny extraframework Lewis acidic SnOx clusters in Sn-Beta-II under study, we hypothesize that the chemical properties of Si–OH groups with neighboring Lewis acidic SnOx clusters (Si–OH···SnOx) have changed. These Si–OH···SnOx sites exhibit a slightly higher acid strength in comparison to that of the common nonacidic silanol groups. Therefore, the 13C CPMAS NMR signals at δ13C 211–214 ppm may be due to acetone-2-13C adsorbed at the aforementioned Si–OH···SnOx sites in the present study.
For support of the aforementioned results, TMPO was also used as a solid-state NMR probe molecule to determine the acidity of the Sn-containing Beta zeolites. The 31P MAS NMR spectra of the TMPO-loaded samples along with the bulk TMPO are given in Figure 9. The dominant 13P MAS NMR signals at 41 ppm correspond to physisorbed TMPO at nonacidic Si–OH groups on [Si]Beta. In addition, other than the strong signal at 41 ppm, no other signals occur for SnO2/[Si]Beta possessing extraframework SnO2 particles, revealing that the TMPO probe molecules could not be bound to the bulk SnO2 species to a large extent. On the other hand, for Sn-Beta-I, a new signal appeared at δ31P 56 ppm, which lies in the expected range for TMPO absorbed on BAS or LAS. (61) According to recent 31P MAS NMR studies of Sn-Beta after TMPO loading, (36) this signal could be assigned to TMPO molecules bound to framework Sn species, originating from the Sn sites at δ119Sn −423 to −443 ppm (Figure 6). Analogously, the 31P MAS NMR signal at 56 ppm for Sn-Beta-II can be attributed to TMPO binding at confined tiny Lewis acidic SnOx species responsible for the 119Sn MAS NMR signal at −605 ppm. In addition, a weak 31P MAS NMR signal also appeared at about 30 ppm over the Sn-Beta samples. According to the former studies, this weak signal may be assigned to “mobile” TMPO bound in the intercrystalline voids or near the windows of the pores of the zeolites. (62)

For Sn-Beta-II and Sn-Beta-III, another 31P MAS NMR signal occurred at 51 ppm, indicating the presence of another type of LAS, in line with the UV–vis results, where distinct isolated SnIV species (UV–vis bands at 207 and 224 nm) were observed. Together with the strong 13C CPMAS NMR signals at about δ13C 211–214 ppm for acetone-2-13C-loaded Sn-Beta-II and Sn-Beta-III (Figure 8), we attribute the 31P MAS NMR signal at 51 ppm to TMPO binding the SnOx···OH–Si defect sites, which is absent in the spectrum of SnO2/Si-Beta containing extraframework bulk SnO2 particles.
3.4. Quantification of Lewis Acidic Sn Sites
Quantitative 1H MAS NMR spectra of the Sn-containing samples were collected using ammonia as a probe molecule to measure the densities of LAS. Generally, 1H MAS NMR signals at 6–7 ppm indicate the formation of ammonium ions at BAS, while signals at −0.5 to 3 ppm hint at the bound ammonia molecules at LAS. (54) The 1H MAS NMR spectra of hydroxyl groups in [Si]Beta and Sn-containing Beta samples are shown in Figure S5. For [Si]Beta zeolite, a dominant 1H MAS NMR signal at 1.3 ppm is attributed to the Si–OH groups at framework defects. Upon ammonia loading, no difference in the 1H MAS NMR spectra occurs, excluding the presence of Brønsted and LAS in [Si]Beta. This result reveals that the Al species are completely removed from the framework of Beta zeolite. After the Sn species is introduced, the intensities of the 1H MAS NMR signal are distinctly enhanced within the range of 0.8–3.0 ppm upon ammonia adsorption (Figure 10). According to previous results, (58) these signals could be assigned to ammonia probe molecules binding at LAS. In comparison with Sn-Beta-I, obvious signals at δ1H 0.8–1.3 ppm occurred for Sn-Beta-II and Sn-Beta-III, indicating the existence of weak LAS corresponding to the 31P MAS NMR signals at 51 ppm (Figure 9). Additionally, no 1H MAS NMR signals at δ1H ≃2.6 ppm due to the bound ammonia probe molecules at strong LAS appear in Sn-Beta-III, in good agreement with the 13C and 31P MAS NMR results, where the signals at δ13C 232 and δ31P 56 ppm due to LAS are both absent (Figures 8 and 9). Furthermore, the 1H MAS NMR signals at 6–7 ppm corresponding to ammonium ions associated with the BAS are also absent. These results confirm that LAS are only generated after the introduction of Sn species into the [Si]Beta matrix, excluding the presence of weak BAS, which can give a 13C CPMAS NMR signal at δ13C 213 ppm after the acetone-2-13C loading. The quantitative determination of the 1H MAS NMR signals at 0.8–2.6 ppm gave the amounts of accessible LAS in the Sn-containing samples: i.e., 0, 0.02, 0.13, and 0.16 mmol/g for 5%SnO2/[Si]Beta, 5%Sn-Beta-III, 5%Sn-Beta-II, and 5%Sn-Beta-I, respectively.

3.5. Catalytic Performance of Sn-Containing Zeolite Samples
The catalytic performance of Sn-containing Beta zeolites was first evaluated in the B-V oxidation of cyclohexanone with H2O2. As shown in Figure 11a and Figure S6a, comparable activities with a cyclohexanone conversion of 30–37% (363 K, 4 h) and a lactone selectivity of 89–92% can be achieved on 5%Sn-Beta-I and 5%Sn-Beta-II, indicating that the as-prepared Sn-Beta samples via the dry impregnation method are very efficient in this reaction. Additionally, a significant cyclohexanone conversion but with a lower lactone selectivity of 78% can be obtained on 5%Sn-Beta-III (363 K, 4 h). The lower selectivity to lactone could be due to the presence of unoccupied Si–OH groups in 5%Sn-Beta-III zeolite, which is enough to catalyze the hydrolysis reaction of lactone to 6-hydroxycaproic acid. (3,19) In contrast, the mixed 5%SnO2/Beta without LAS exhibits negligible activity, confirming that LAS are indeed the active sites for the reaction.
Figure 11
Figure 11. Catalytic performance of the Sn-containing catalysts in the B-V oxidation of cyclohexanone (a) and cyclohexene oxide hydration (b), as well as the plots of reaction rates as a function of the number of accessible LAS.
Our recent studies demonstrated that the epoxide hydration could also be realized over water-tolerant solid Lewis acids. (3) The catalytic performance of postsynthesized Sn-containing Beta zeolites was further studied in cyclohexene oxide hydration. As shown in Figure 11b and Figure S6b, the mixed 5%SnO2/[Si]Beta without LAS exhibited a negligible activity in epoxide hydration. In contrast, a significant activity with 12% cyclohexene oxide conversion and 85% 1,2-diol selectivity could be achieved on Sn-Beta-III. When 5%Sn-Beta-I and 5%Sn-Beta-II with more LAS are applied as catalysts, higher cyclohexene oxide conversion and 1,2-diol selectivity can be achieved. Obviously, the LAS in Sn-containing Beta zeolites are vital to achieve a good catalytic performance in cyclohexene oxide hydration.
For further comparison of the relevance of the catalytic activity to the density of accessible LAS in Sn-containing Beta samples under study, the initial reaction rates in Baeyer–Villiger oxidation and epoxide hydration catalyzed by various Sn-containing zeolites under identical reaction conditions with a TOS of 1 h are plotted as a function of the number of LAS in the samples. Clearly, the number of LAS correlates well with the activity in Baeyer–Villiger oxidation and epoxide hydration, evidencing that the LAS generated from Sn sites are responsible for the catalytic activity. On the other hand, these data also confirm that the LAS originating from the tiny extraframework SnOx clusters confined in [Si]Beta zeolite exhibit a catalytic activity comparable to that of the isolated SnIV sites in Sn-containing Beta zeolites.
The recyclability of 5%Sn-Beta-I and 5%Sn-Beta-II in the B-V oxidation of cyclohexanone and cyclohexene oxide hydration was also studied (Figure S6c,d). After washing with acetone solvent and calcining at 823 K for 6 h, the catalytic activity of the regenerated catalysts could be completely recovered after four cycles. This indicates that the LAS originating from the Sn(IV) sites within the BEA framework and tiny extraframework SnOx clusters confined in [Si]Beta zeolite both exhibit excellent stability in Baeyer–Villiger oxidation and epoxide hydration.
4. Conclusions
A variety of Sn-containing Beta zeolites with the framework or extraframework Sn species were prepared by a two-step postsynthesis strategy in the present work. For clarification of the nature of the Sn species, several approaches including DRIFT, XPS, UV–vis, and 119Sn MAS NMR spectroscopy were used for comparison. The characterization results distinctly demonstrated that the sophisticated 119Sn MAS NMR technique can clearly discriminate the tetrahedral framework and octahedral extraframework Sn sites and also offer inferences for the sizes of extraframework SnO2 clusters. In contrast, the frequently utilized DRIFT, UV–vis, and XPS spectra characterizing the local structures of Sn species require an explanation of spectral features with more imprecision and ambiguity.
The Lewis acidic features of the Sn species were identified via acetone-2-13C, TMPO, and NH3 adsorption, investigated via 13C, 31P, and 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy, respectively. Two types of LAS have been observed and attributed to (i) tetrahedral framework Sn sites and (ii) octahedral extraframework SnOx clusters confined inside the pores of [Si]Beta zeolite, both exhibiting Lewis acidic properties. Additionally, the Lewis acidic characteristics of the extraframework SnOx species were found to depend on the cluster sizes. The confined SnOx clusters with sizes of 0.5–2 nm possess Lewis acidic characteristics similar to those of the tetrahedral framework Sn sites and exhibit comparable catalytic performance in the B-V oxidation of cyclohexanone and cyclohexene oxide hydration. With an increase in the size of the SnOx clusters, the Lewis acidic characteristics of these extraframework Sn species gradually weaken or even disappear. These results have enhanced our understanding of the essence of Lewis acidic Sn sites in Sn-containing Beta zeolites.
