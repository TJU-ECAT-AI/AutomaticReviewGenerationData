Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation is one of the most admired technologies for propylene production. However, the development of an active and stable catalyst presents a significant challenge. In this study, Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalysts were prepared via coimpregnation, followed by H2 reduction, and applied in propane dehydrogenation. The Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalyst with a Ga/Pt molar ratio of 1 exhibited a high propane conversion of up to 60% and high selectivity toward propylene of 98.2% at 550 °C for 10 min, with a propane conversion of 51.6% and propylene selectivity of 99.5% after reaction for 25 h. The physicochemical properties characterized using N2 physisorption, XRD, TEM, XPS, CO chemisorption, and in situ CO–DRIFT spectroscopy reveal that the Pt–Ga alloy nanoparticles were formed on the SBA-15 support after direct reduction with H2. The study of coke formation via temperature-programmed oxidation showed that a large amount of coke was deposited over the support of spent Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalyst, indicating coke mobility from the active sites to the supports and its contribution to catalyst stability. The activities of spent catalysts could be almost completely recovered via reduction regeneration, during which Pt–Ga alloy retains the original geometrical and electronic structure well. The dilution of Pt ensembles due to the addition of Ga, e.g., Pt–Ga alloy formation, plays an important role in enhancing the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation.

1. Introduction
Propylene is an important building block for various industrial chemicals including polypropylene, acrolein, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and so on. Given the scarcity of fossil fuels and the surge of shale gas, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become a widely used on-purpose route to satisfy the ever-increasing global demand for propylene. (1−4) PDH is a thermodynamically limited reaction. Thus, a high reaction temperature is often required to obtain economically attractive propylene yields. However, such a harsh reaction condition impedes selectivity for the target propylene. Unlike propane, propylene molecules possessing an unsaturated C═C bond are more easily adsorbed and activated on the catalyst surface, thus involving them in undesirable side reactions. Coke is then produced and blocks the active site over catalysts. The used catalyst is periodically regenerated in an oxidative atmosphere at high temperatures to maintain an acceptable service lifetime, removing coke from the catalyst surface and also accelerating the sintering of active metals. (5,6) Therefore, the development of a good PDH catalyst that is highly active and stable at high temperatures presents a serious challenge.
Al2O3-supported Pt catalysts employed in the UOP C3 Oleflex process are thus far the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts. They have many advantages over CrOx-based catalysts, such as selective C–H bond activation and ecofriendliness. Nonetheless, deactivation due to coke formation still occurs on Pt-based catalysts. Isolation of Pt atoms is an efficient strategy to inhibit the undesirable side reactions of PDH. Pt–Pt ensembles can be diluted, and propylene selectivity and catalyst stability can be enhanced when alloyed with certain inactive metals such as Sn, (7−13) Ga, (14−18) Zn, (19,20) In, (21,22) Cu, (23,24) Ni, (25) and Ge. (26,27) These bimetallic catalysts have been studied to improve catalytic performance, among which Pt–Sn catalyst is the most classic example.
In addition to notable Pt–Sn, Pt–Ga is also a bimetallic combination in which each individual component was reported to be active in PDH. Matveyeva et al. used a Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst for isobutane dehydrogenation at atmospheric pressure and 520–580 °C; they observed higher selectivity toward dehydrogenation than to cracking over the catalyst. (28) The trace amount of Pt markedly promoted the activity over the Ga2O3 catalyst. Microkinetic analysis suggested that the Pt–O site induces dehydrogenation, and the Ga–O site remains active for H2 desorption. (14) Searles et al. (17) demonstrated the role of GaxPt alloy and isolated Ga sites in promoting PDH. Nakaya et al. (16) designed three-hold-Pt ensembles blocked by Pb deposition, and reported that single-atom Pt in intermetallics results in highly selective and stable PDH. The aforementioned results have thus far been reported to explain Pt–Ga catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The intrinsic role of Ga on Pt for dehydrogenation and the differences between Ga and Sn as promoters remain elusive.
Moreover, mesoporous silica materials with high surface areas and well-ordered channels can evidently enhance the diffusion and increase the catalyst stability and lifetime, which are widely used supports for thermocatalytic reaction. (29−31) Wang et al. used mesoporous silica to isolate Sn and found that it is stable and selective for propane dehydrogenation. (32) Chen et al. compared the roles of SBA-15 and SiO2 in methylcyclohexane dehydrogenation and found that SBA-15 increased the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and restricted its further growth and that the Pt–SBA-15 catalyst exhibited higher stability. (33)
Therefore, in this study, we synthesized SBA-15 support for the preparation of Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalysts and applied them in propane dehydrogenation to propylene. Their catalytic performance was studied and compared with Pt–Sn/SBA-15. Their structural properties were clarified with characterization techniques including N2 adsorption–desorption, XRD, XPS, TEM, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF)-STEM, CO chemisorption, and in situ DRIFT spectroscopy. It was found that the isolation of Pt atoms due to Pt–Ga alloy formation over SBA-15 is important to the highly enhanced catalytic activity. Furthermore, unlike the promoter Sn, the addition of Ga substantially drained the coke gathering around the active site to the support, and Pt–Ga/SBA-15 exhibited a slightly better stability than Pt–Sn/SBA-15. Finally, reduction regeneration is more conducive to maintaining and activating the formed Pt–Ga nanoalloys than an oxidation–reduction regeneration method. The activity of spent Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalyst could be almost completely recovered by reduction regeneration. The present work might provide a choice for the development of a high-efficiency catalyst system for propane dehydrogenation.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Catalyst Preparation
The mesoporous silica SBA-15 was synthesized with a typical hydrothermal method. Briefly, 5 g of Pluronic P123 (EO20PO70EO20, Mn 5800, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 177 mL of HCl aqueous solution (2 mol L–1). The mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 6 h. Then, 10.56 g of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, 98%, Aladdin) was slowly dripped into the mixture under stirring. The resultant solution was further stirred at 40 °C for 48 h. The white gel mixture was loaded into an autoclave lined with Teflon and aged at 100 °C for 48 h. The obtained sample was filtered, washed using distilled water, and desiccated at 100 °C for 12 h. The sample was ultimately calcined at 550 °C for 6 h, thereby obtaining the SBA-15 support.
The Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalyst was prepared by coimpregnation with H2PtCl6·6H2O (Aladdin) and Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (x = 7–9, Aladdin) as the precursors. The support was typically impregnated with H2PtCl6 and Ga(NO3)3·xH2O solution. The mixed aqueous solution was sonicated for 0.5 h and then stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The resultant mixture was evaporated at 60 °C for 12 h. Then, the dried sample was reduced with H2 at 550 °C for 1 h to obtain the Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalyst. The loading of Pt was 3 wt %, and the catalysts were labeled as xPtyGa/SBA-15, where x and y represent the initial molar ratio of Pt to Ga.
For comparison, Pt/SBA-15 and 1Pt1Sn/SBA-15 catalysts with 3 wt % Pt were prepared using the same method. The catalyst Ga2O3/SBA-15 with a loading of 3 wt % on the basis of Ga was calcined at 550 °C for 2 h under a N2 stream.
2.2. Catalyst Evaluation
Propane dehydrogenation took place in a fixed-bed quartz tube reactor (diameter: 8 mm), which was packed with 100 mg of the catalyst (20–40 mesh pellets). Before catalyst evaluation, the sample was first treated with 25 vol % H2/N2 gaseous mixture (50 mL min–1) at 550 °C for 1 h (except for the Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst). The temperature was then maintained at 550 °C, and a reactant gas mixture was fed (100 mL min–1, C3H8/H2/N2 = 4:1:15, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 12 L h–1 g–1cat, atmospheric pressure). The consequential gas products were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (Ramiin GC2060).
2.3. Catalyst Regeneration Operation
The spent catalyst was regenerated by oxidation–reduction or reduction treatments. For oxidation–reduction regeneration treatment, the catalyst was operated for propane dehydrogenation for 4 h. The reactor was purged with 20 vol % O2/N2 gaseous mixture (50 mL min–1) at 550 °C for 1 h to remove the carbon deposits. Then, the reactor was purged with N2 for 0.5 h. Finally, the catalyst was reduced with 25 vol % H2/N2 gaseous mixture (50 mL min–1) at 550 °C for 1 h. For reduction regeneration treatment, the spent catalyst (after reaction for 4 h) was regenerated by reduction at 550 °C for 1 h using a 25 vol % H2/N2 gaseous mixture (50 mL min–1). The catalyst regenerated with oxidation–reduction or reduction treatment was labeled as “Pt–Ga/SBA-15(OR)” or “Pt–Ga/SBA-15(R)”, respectively.
2.4. Catalyst Characterization
N2 adsorption–desorption experiments were performed using a Quantachrome Autosorb iQ analyzer. Prior to the physisorption measurements, the catalysts were pretreated in a vacuum at 150 °C for 12 h. The specific surface areas of the catalysts were measured using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method. The specific pore volume and pore diameter data were determined with the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a Smartlab X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (γ = 1.5406 Å) radiation sources in the 2θ range of 10–90° with a scan rate of 10°/min.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of different catalysts were recorded using HT7800 and JEM-2100F microscopes, respectively. The powder sample was ultrasonicated in ethanol, and a small amount of the resulting suspension was deposited on carbon-coated copper grids.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded using an ESCALAB Xi+ spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) with monochromic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV) in a chamber under vacuum conditions of 8 × 10–10 Pa. The XPS data were collected at a pass energy of 30 eV for C 1s, Si 2p, Pt 4f, and Ga 3d core XPS levels. The binding energies were calibrated by adjusting the C 1s peak to 284.8 eV.
The number of exposed Pt surface sites was estimated by CO chemisorption using a chemisorption analyzer (ChemStar, Quantachrome Instruments) equipped with TCD detectors. First, 50 mg of catalyst precursor was packed in a quartz tube and reduced with hydrogen at 550 °C for 1 h, followed by a pure He (30 mL min–1) purge for 1 h at the same temperature. CO chemisorption was carried out at 50 °C, and each sample was repeated five times. The amount of exposed Pt was determined from the amount of adsorbed CO.
In situ CO diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (CO–DRIFTs) was performed using a FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet IS50, Thermo Fisher, USA). Before the CO chemisorption test was conducted, the catalysts were placed in an in situ DRIFTs cell and slightly pressed onto a flat surface. Reduction was carried out under a H2 stream (50 mL min–1) at 500 °C for 30 min. The cell was then cooled to 30 °C under a N2 stream, and background spectral data were obtained. CO adsorption was conducted with 10 vol % CO/N2 flowing.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis was performed using a chemisorption analyzer (ChemStar, Quantachrome Instruments) coupled to an online mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum, D-35614 Asslar). First, 50 mg of spent catalysts was packed in a quartz tube and pretreated at 100 °C for 30 min under Ar stream (30 mL min–1). Then, the temperature was increased to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 using a 20 vol % O2/N2 gaseous mixture (30 mL min–1). The amount of CO2 formed was analyzed using an online mass spectrometer.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Catalytic Performances over Supported Pt–Ga Bimetallic Catalysts
The catalytic activities of propane dehydrogenation with time-on-stream over Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalysts with different Pt/Ga nominal ratios, Pt/SBA-15, Ga2O3/SBA-15, 1Pt1Sn/SBA-15, 1Pt1Ga/fumed silica, and 1Pt1Ga/nanosilica catalysts are presented in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1A, the amount of Ga added to the Pt/SBA-15 catalyst significantly influenced the activities of propane dehydrogenation. Propane conversion first increased and then decreased with an increase in Ga. Figure 1B shows that the selectivity toward propylene also improved with the addition of Ga. Notably, the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance. The initial conversion of propane achieved 60%, and the selectivity toward propylene exceeded 98%. This catalyst also exhibited superior stability during a reaction for 4 h, and no apparent decrease in propane conversion was observed after reacting for 4 h.

(C) Propane conversion over SBA-15, fumed silica, and nanosilica-supported Pt–Ga and Pt–Sn catalysts. (D) Selectivity of propylene over SBA-15-, fumed silica-, and nanosilica-supported Pt–Ga and Pt–Sn catalysts.
Other types of fumed silica or nanosilica were also used to support Pt–Ga catalysts. As shown in Figure 1C,D, the type of support material considerably affects the catalytic performance. Even thought the catalysts showed similar selectivity, the propane conversion was markedly lower for supports other than that of the Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalyst. These results indicate the contribution of the unique structural properties of SBA-15 to the superior performances of the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst. Furthermore, we compared the Pt–Ga bimetallic catalyst with the Pt–Sn bimetallic catalyst, which is a widely used catalyst for PDH. (34,35) As shown in Figure 1C,D, both SBA-15 catalysts exhibited superior dehydrogenation performance with similar initial conversions of propane. However, the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst exhibited slightly higher stability than the 1Pt1Sn/SBA-15. Compared with the 1Pt1Sn/SBA-15 catalyst, the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst retained its higher activity and showed a lower deactivation rate with an increase in reaction time. Moreover, without Pt, the Ga-based catalysts also exhibited activity and selectivity for PDH; even the catalytic activity over the Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst was much lower than that of either the Pt/SBA-15 or Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalysts.
Considering that the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst exhibited the most activity among the catalysts tested in this study, we further evaluated its stability. As shown in Figure 2, the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst shows excellent stability, as does the 1Pt1Sn/SBA-15 catalyst (the widely known excellent bimetallic catalyst), although both catalysts exhibited high selectivity toward propylene and similar initial conversion. After the reaction for 50 h, the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst retained its activities (46.2% conversion and 99.7% selectivity at 50 h) and showed a slightly lower deactivation rate than the 1Pt1Sn/SBA-15 catalyst.

3.2. Structural Properties of Supported Pt–Ga Bimetallic Catalysts
Figure 3 presents the XRD patterns of Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalysts. The broad peaks in all the catalysts at around 22° can be ascribed to the silica support. The Pt/SBA-15 catalyst showed diffraction peaks at 39.8, 46.2, 67.4, and 81.3°, corresponding to Pt (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) (JCDPS No. 04-0802), respectively. With the addition of Ga, the peak due to Pt (1 1 1) shifted toward higher angles, which can be clearly observed in the catalysts with a greater amount of Ga additive. Particularly, the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst revealed the features of a Pt3Ga alloy with conspicuous diffraction peaks at 40.1° (JCDPS No. 65-8000). (36,37) This finding indicates the incorporation of Ga into the Pt lattice and the formation of Pt3Ga alloys. Meanwhile, the intensity of the Pt–Ga phase peaks weakened relative to that of Pt/SBA-15, suggesting that the addition of Ga diluted the Pt nanoparticles. Finally, no Ga species peaks were detected on Pt–Ga/SBA-15, indicating the high dispersion of Ga species.

As shown in Table 1 and Figure 4, 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15, Pt/SBA-15, and Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalysts and SBA-15 support exhibited a typical type-IV adsorption isotherm with an H1-type hysteresis loop, suggesting a mesoporous structure. This structure is consistent with the regular hexagonal mesoporous structure of SBA-15. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the supported catalysts, including 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15, Pt/SBA-15, and Ga2O3/SBA-15, still exhibited type-IV adsorption isotherms with an H1-type hysteresis loop, indicating that the structure of SBA-15 did not considerably change with the metal loading. The average pore size and pore volume of the pure SBA-15 supports were 6.64 nm and 1.18 cm3 g–1, respectively, which slightly decreased in the cases of supported catalysts. It was implied that Pt or Ga species may have penetrated into the mesoporous channels of SBA-15.

Figure 5 presents the HRTEM images and elemental mapping images of the catalysts. The highly ordered hexagonal mesoporosity of the SBA-15 support is shown in Figure 5c,e, being consistent with the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms results. With monometallic Pt loading, metallic Pt nanoparticles can be observed over SBA-15 in Figure 5d, exhibiting a wide particle size distribution and an average size of 5.4 nm. In contrast, SBA-15-supported bimetallic Pt–Ga catalysts exhibited smaller particles with an average size of about 4.8 nm, as shown in Figure 5a. These results suggest that the addition of Ga reduces the average size of Pt particles and improves the dispersion of Pt, as suggested by the XRD results. Figure 5f shows the HAADF–STEM image of the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst. Over fully distributed Si in Figure 5i, Pt is also highly dispersed on SBA-15 (Figure 5g), where Ga coexists and shows similar distribution features with Pt (Figure 5h). This observation strongly suggests the intimate locations of Pt and Ga species. Considering the XRD results, the formation of Pt–Ga alloys on the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst could be confirmed.

3.3. Surface Analysis of Supported Pt–Ga Bimetallic Catalysts
XPS studies were conducted to determine the surface species of the catalysts. Table 2 summarizes the binding energies of Pt and Ga from their spectra presented in Figure 6. Pt 4f7/2 peaks appeared at 70.89 eV for 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 and at 71.08 eV for Pt/SBA-15. On the basis of their binding energies, the platinum species in both 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 and Pt/SBA-15 can be ascribed to metallic Pt. The binding energy of Pt 4f decreased when Ga was added to Pt/SBA-15, indicating the electronic effects of Ga over Pt.

The surface Ga/Pt ratio for 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst was as high as 3, significantly larger than the bulk Ga/Pt ratio of 1, which indicates the enrichment of Ga surface over the Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalyst. We further studied the Ga species in the Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalyst by preparing a Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst with the same Ga content as that of the Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalyst for comparison. Two peaks appeared at about 20.20 and 24.50 eV for the Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst, which can be attributed to Ga3+ 3d bands and O 2s bands, respectively. (38,39) The weaker Ga3+ 3d band peak was located at 20.20 eV for the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst. Even Pt3Ga was clearly detected over the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst via XRD technique, but the electronic effect of Pt over Ga was not observed from the Ga3+ 3d band peak. This can be ascribed to the presence of more oxidized Ga on the catalyst surface. Ga was partially alloyed with Pt, and the remaining Ga presented in the oxidation state and enriched over the catalyst surface, as shown in the XRD and XPS data. Furthermore, it was also possible that the overlapping of the Ga 3d signal with the O 2s peak induced chemical shift errors, resulting in the ratio of reduced Ga species becoming hard to measure. (40)
Table 3 shows the CO pulse chemisorption results of the Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalysts with different Pt/Ga nominal ratios. The CO uptake first increased and then decreased with the increase in Ga content. It was indicated that a small amount of Ga introduced to the Pt/SBA-15 catalyst slightly increased the number of accessible exposed Pt surface sites because of the increase in Pt dispersion with the formation of Pt–Ga nanoalloys. The CO/Pt nominal ratio for Pt/SBA-15 was 0.107, and that for 8Pt1Ga/SBA-15 was 0.163. However, the CO/Pt ratio for 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 was much smaller at just 0.045. Combined with the XRD, TEM, and XPS results, we suggest that CO chemisorption was inhibited by Pt–Ga nanoalloys or the surface enrichment of Ga species.
Table 3. CO Chemisorption Results for Catalysts
catalysts CO adsorption (μmol g–1) CO/Pt
Pt/SBA-15 16.5 0.107
8Pt1Ga/SBA-15 25.1 0.163
5Pt1Ga/SBA-15 25.8 0.168
2Pt1Ga/SBA-15 14.3 0.093
1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 6.9 0.045
1Pt2Ga/SBA-15 5.7 0.037
We further evaluated the surface properties of the Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalysts by performing CO–DRIFTs measurements. As seen from Figure 7, for the Pt/SBA-15 catalyst, a peak initially appeared at 2077 cm–1 with the introduction of the CO gas. Subsequently, the peak at 2077 cm–1 intensified with an increase in the CO flowing time, and two new, narrow, and weak peaks near 2123 and 2171 cm–1 occurred. Three peaks appeared near 2077, 2123, and 2171 cm–1, which can be ascribed to the CO linearly adsorbed on Pt atoms. The bands at 2123 and 2171 cm–1 could be attributed to the weak adsorption of CO on the Pt surface. Moreover, another peak at 1859 cm–1 was present, which could be assigned to the bridge-bonded CO on Pt ensembles.
Figure 7
Figure 7. DRIFT spectra of CO adsorbed on the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 and Pt/SBA-15 catalysts.
For the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst, the intensity of the peak related to the linear Pt–CO adsorption was weaker than that for the Pt/SBA-15 catalyst, suggesting a smaller amount of Pt was exposed on the surface of the atoms over the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst than those over Pt/SBA-15. Notably, the bridge-bonded CO around 1859 cm–1 was not observed over 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15. It was implied that the addition of Ga significantly modified the geometric properties of Pt. Large Pt ensembles favoring bridge-bonded CO disappeared over 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15. Combined with the XRD and XRS data, it was concluded that the formation of Pt–Ga nanoalloys decreased the size of Pt ensembles. Moreover, the Ga species could cover the step, edge, and corner sites of Pt nanoparticles. Figure 7 further shows the shift of the linear Pt–CO adsorption vibration peak (2077–2085 cm–1, 2123-2117 cm–1) with the addition of Ga, probably resulting from the electronic modification of Pt by alloying with Ga.
3.4. Coke Deposition and Catalyst Regeneration
Coke formation is one of the main reasons for catalyst deactivation during high-temperature reactions. (41−43) Thus, we further conducted the coke analysis of the spent Pt–Ga bimetallic catalysts by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Figure 8 shows CO2 formation over the spent catalysts during TPO. Table S1 displays the semiquantitative results of the TPO and carbon balance results. The monometallic spent Pt/SBA-15 catalyst exhibited a small and broad peak at ∼475 °C (α peak) accompanied with a big and narrow peak (β peak) at ∼548 °C; these peaks were mostly attributed to the coke deposited on the active metal site or SBA-15 support, respectively. (31) Moreover, α and β peaks with decreased intensity were observed for the spent Pt–Sn/SBA-15 catalysts, implying the inhibition of coke formation with Sn addition. As the reaction time increased from 4 to 25 h, the amount of coke formed did not change a lot. More interestingly, the spent Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalyst after 4 h of reaction only exhibited a β peak without an α peak. It was strongly implied that there was different coke deposition behavior over the SBA-15-supported Pt–Ga bimetallic catalysts compared with the Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts and the Pt monometallic catalyst. It seems that almost all coke was located on the support, avoiding blocking of the active site. Such a drain-off effect─ the coke shifting from an active metal surface to the inert supports (44−46)─substantially contributed to the excellent catalytic stability of the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst. Differently from Pt–Sn/SBA-15, more coke formed on 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 as the reaction time increased from 4 to 25 h. Ga addition significantly drained the coke gathering around the active site to the support SBA-15 with a high specific surface area and unique pore structure. This is vital for the high stability of the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst during the long-time reaction, as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 8
Figure 8. Temperature-programmed oxidation profiles of the spent catalysts (the spent catalysts were obtained after propane dehydrogenation for 4 or 25 h under the following reaction conditions: T = 550 °C, WHSV = 12 L h–1 g–1cat, P = 1 atm, C3H8/H2/N2 = 4:1:15, total flow = 100 mL min–1, mcat = 0.1 g).
Even with the drain-off effect of Ga, still a great amount of coke was deposited on the support as the reaction progressed. The service lifetime of the catalyst was prolonged via the elimination of formed coke via two catalyst regeneration methods that were carried out on the spent catalysts. As shown in Figure 9, the reacted Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalyst was regenerated by oxidation–reduction or reduction treatment for three cycles. The initial propane conversion over the fresh 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst was 60.6%. With the first regeneration of oxidation–reduction treatment, the selectivity of propylene was slightly improved, and the conversion of propane was substantially decreased in comparison with the fresh catalyst. The initial conversions of propane over the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst in the following three cycles were 49.0%, 40.9%, and 34.6%. In contrast, the catalytic activity can be almost completely recovered by reduction treatment. During the three regeneration cycle tests, the initial conversions of propane over the 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst were 58.3%, 56.9%, and 56.4%, being close to the 60.6% conversion achieved with the fresh catalyst.

(B) Catalyst regeneration by reduction treatment (reaction conditions: T = 550 °C, WHSV = 12 L h–1 g–1cat, P = 1 atm, C3H8/H2/N2 = 4:1:15, total flow = 100 mL min–1, mcat = 0.1 g).
We studied the structure of the reacted 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst regenerated by oxidation–reduction or reduction treatment for three cycles to understand the effects of the two different regeneration treatments on the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation. Figure S4 shows the carbon deposition over two catalysts. Compared with reduction treatment, oxidation–reduction treatment affords an extremely smaller CO2 signal, indicating that coke could be almost removed from the catalyst by oxidation–reduction. However, such a treatment resulted in a great loss of catalyst activity. Weckhuysen et al. reported Sn segregation from Pt–Sn alloy on Al2O3 during coke burning (oxidation treatment) and regeneration of Pt–Sn alloy phases via following reduction. They also pointed out that multiple dehydrogenation–regeneration cycles result in a gradual Sn enrichment of the alloy, leading to a decrease in the overall dehydrogenation activity. (5) In this study, the XRD patterns of the two regenerated 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalysts shown in Figure 10 exhibited a Pt3Ga alloy phase (JCDPS No. 65-8000), indicating that oxidation–reduction or reduction treatment did not significantly change the alloy formed. However, stronger diffraction peaks over 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 (OR, 3 cycle) than 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 (R, 3 cycle) indicated alloy sintering occurred with the oxidation–reduction treatment for three times. Meanwhile, oxidation–reduction regeneration affords apparently stronger Pt 4f XPS signals than the reduction regeneration catalyst (Figure 11). This result further proves that oxidation–reduction regeneration results into alloy sintering. The Pt 4f7/2 peak position of fresh 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 catalyst was 70.89 eV, which shifted to 70.50 eV with oxidation–reduction treatment for three times. It was indicated that the surface Pt chemical environment or the electron interaction between Pt and Ga changed. In contrast, reduction regeneration avoids Ga segregation and realloying and maintains the active structure of Pt–Ga nanoalloys so that no obvious sintering occurs. Thus, the catalytic activity was greatly recovered even with various reaction-regeneration cycles, as shown in Figure 9 B. Those results indicate that direct reduction is a more suitable regeneration method than oxidation–reduction regeneration for SBA-15-supported Pt–Ga bimetallic catalysts.

4. Conclusions
Mesoporous silica SBA-15-supported Pt–Ga bimetallic catalysts were prepared via coimpregnation followed by direct reduction with H2. The Ga/Pt ratio substantially influenced the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. The Pt–Ga/SBA-15 catalyst with a Ga/Pt molar ratio of 1 exhibited the highest activity and best stability, for which Pt–Ga alloys with a metallic Ga-enriched surface were highly dispersed on SBA-15. The high specific surface area and unique pore structure of SBA-15 not only improved the dispersion of Pt–Ga alloy nanoparticles but also held a substantial amount of coke formed. With the addition of Ga, coke can be drained from the active site to the supports, therefore 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15 exhibited a slightly better stability than 1Pt1Sn/SBA-15. Reduction regeneration can avoid the oxidation of Pt–Ga alloys during the regeneration and maintain the geometrical and electronic structure of Pt–Ga nanoalloys, thus effectively recovering the activities of spent catalysts. It is one more suitable regeneration method for mesoporous silica SBA-15-supported Pt–Ga bimetallic catalyst.
