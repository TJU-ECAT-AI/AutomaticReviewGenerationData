Heterogeneous single-atom catalysis
Single-atom catalysis has arguably become the most active new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis. Aided by recent advances in practical synthetic methodologies, characterization techniques and computational modelling, we now have a large number of single-atom catalysts (SACs) that exhibit distinctive performances for a wide variety of chemical reactions. This Perspective summarizes recent experimental and computational efforts aimed at understanding the bonding in SACs and how this relates to catalytic performance. The examples described here illustrate the utility of SACs in a broad scope of industrially important reactions and highlight the advantages these catalysts have over those presently used. SACs have well-defined active centres, such that unique opportunities exist for the rational design of new catalysts with high activities, selectivities and stabilities. Indeed, given a certain practical application, we can often design a suitable SAC; thus, the field has developed very rapidly and afforded promising catalyst leads. Moreover, the control we have over certain SAC structures paves the way for designing base metal catalysts with the activities of noble metal catalysts. It appears that we are entering a new era of heterogeneous catalysis in which we have control over well-dispersed single-atom active sites whose properties we can readily tune.
