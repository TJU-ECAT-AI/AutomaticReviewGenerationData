Dehydrogenation of propane over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalyst
Abstract
The dehydrogenation of propane and the hydrogenation of propylene were kinetically investigated over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts. The reactions were carried out in conventional closed static reactor at temperatures ranging from 443 to 505 °C. The runs were performed on propane, propane + propylene, propane + hydrogen and propylene + hydrogen. The rates were obtained from the initial slope of the pressure-time curves. The reaction rate data were described satisfactorily with the rate equation such as It was concluded that the rate determining step of the reaction was (C3H8)a → (C3H6)a + (H2)a.
