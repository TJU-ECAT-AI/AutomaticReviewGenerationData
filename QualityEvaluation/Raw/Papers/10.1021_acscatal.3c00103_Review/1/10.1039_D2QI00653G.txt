Advances in zeolite-supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation
Propylene is one of the building blocks in modern industry and the feedstock for polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and other important chemicals. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most promising on-purpose technologies to produce propylene, and thus has attracted widespread attention from both the academic and industrial communities. In recent years, zeolite-supported metal catalysts have exhibited excellent activity and superhigh stability in PDH reactions, which even exceed that of industrial catalysts, suggesting their great application prospects. In this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the latest research progress in the synthesis of state-of-the-art zeolite-supported metal catalysts, including monometal catalysts, bimetal catalysts, and single-site catalysts, and their outstanding catalytic activity in PDH reactions. Also, their advanced characterization techniques, catalytic mechanisms, and structure–function relationships are introduced simultaneously. Finally, some current limitations and future perspectives in the field of zeolite-supported metal catalysts for PDH processes are proposed. It is expected that this review will provide references and give insights into the future design of highly efficient zeolite-supported metal catalysts for PDH applications.

1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important basic chemicals that can be processed into various types of value-added products, such as polymers (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and polyesters), oxygenates (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde), daily care products, and washing detergent.1 The conventional propylene production processes include fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel.2 However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene. Thus, given these circumstances, a highly efficient way to produce propylene is urgently need, both scientifically and economically.3 In the past few years, multiple technologies for the production of propylene have been developed, such as the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process,4,5 Fischer–Tropsch (FT) process,6 and propane dehydrogenation (PDH).7 Particularly, PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products.7–15 In addition, with the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap. Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions. The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable. Accordingly, two have competitors emerged, i.e., Chevron (Catofin technology, now Lummus) and UOP (Oleflex technology), with their technology patented in 1968 and 1970, respectively.7,16–19 Afterwards, Snamprogetti-Yarsintez and Linde-BASF presented the FBD-4 process and PDH process to the world, causing a so-called “propylene rush”, which created a fortune worth hundreds of millions. Fig. 1 summarizes the representative industrial PDH reaction technologies.7,20–23

It is well-known that the PDH reaction is a highly endothermic process, involving an increase in gas molecules, which means a higher temperature contributes to higher conversion. To date, platinum (Pt)- and chromic oxide (CrOx)-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for these industrial processes, which generally use Al2O3 as a support to immobilize the metal species.7,9,12,24,25 However, during the PDH reaction at high temperatures (500–600 °C), Al2O3-supported metal catalysts are usually subjected to severe metal sintering, resulting in a fast and irreversible loss in their activity, requiring frequent regeneration. In addition, the undesirable acidity of the Al2O3 support is usually detrimental to the PDH reaction, leading to the fast formation of coke deposition on the surface of catalysts, which quickly deactivates their catalytic activity.
Zeolites are a class of crystalline nanoporous materials with large specific surface areas, well-defined and varisized microporous channels, and adjustable acidity and basicity, which have been widely applied in various industrial processes, exhibiting extraordinary catalytic activities and product selectivities.26–33 For instance, in the MTO process, silicoaluminophosphate SAPO-34 (CHA zeotype) exhibits superior selectivity for ethylene and propylene (>80%) due to its narrow 8-membered pore openings and large cha cages,4,5 zeolite Y (USY zeotype) exhibits excellent catalytic activity in fluid catalytic cracking, and the introduction of ZSM-5 (MFI zeotype) zeolites can increase the octane number of gasoline.30,34 In recent years, zeolites have also been regarded as ideal supports to anchor different types of metal species with high dispersity, achieving excellent performance in various heterogeneous catalysis. In comparison with other supported metal catalysts, zeolite-supported metal catalysts show significantly improved thermal/hydrothermal stability during catalytic reactions, especially under harsh conditions and unique shape-selective catalytic performances.35–43 Currently, a series of zeolite-supported metal catalysts, such as zeolite-supported monometal catalysts,44–46 zeolite-supported bimetal catalysts,47–50 and zeolite-supported single-site catalysts,51,52 have been developed and exhibited unprecedented long-term stability and ultrahigh selectivity for propylene in PDH reactions (more than 99%), which have attracted widespread attention from both the academic and industrial communities, reflecting their great potential in future practical large-scale applications for PDH reactions.
Currently, there are multiple elegant reviews focusing on summarizing the development of PDH techniques and catalysts,7,9,10,12 advanced synthesis and characterization of zeolite-supported metal catalysts, as well as their wide applications in various types of catalytic reactions.39,41,42 However, to date, no exclusive review on zeolite-supported metal catalysts for PDH reactions has been presented. Considering that there is a rising tide in the design and development of zeolite-supported metal catalysts for PDH processes, we aim to present a comprehensive summary of the advances in zeolite-supported metal catalysts, including zeolite-supported monometal catalysts, zeolite-supported bimetal catalysts, and zeolite-supported single-site catalysts, for PDH reactions, especially in the last five years (Fig. 2). The properties of representative zeolite-supported metal catalysts and their catalytic performances in PDH reactions are summarized in Table 1. In addition, the confinement effect of zeolites and the synergistic effect between different metallic components and between metal species and zeolites, as well as their structure–function relationship in PDH reactions are discussed simultaneously. In the last section of this review, we present some current limitations and future perspectives on opportunities and challenges in this topic. We expect that this review will offer some guidance on the future design and optimization of zeolite-supported metal catalysts for PDH reactions.

2. Zeolite-supported monometal catalysts
2.1 Zeolite-supported Pt catalysts
Pt is the most widely used noble metal for propane dehydrogenation because of its higher C–H bond activation over C–C bond scission.44,104 Generally, the active sites for the PDH process are at the terraces of the coordinatively saturated Pt sites and at the steps, corners, and edges of the unsaturated Pt sites.14,105 Therefore, the catalytic activity of Pt species, especially the conversion of propane can be significantly enhanced with a decrease in the particle size of Pt species.42 Corma and co-workers developed a novel strategy for the fabrication of ultrasmall Pt clusters/atoms with exceptionally high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions.44 The subnanometric Pt species were prepared through a reduction method using dimethyl formamide (DMF) as a weak reductant and capping agent. The Pt precursors were wrapped between the lamellar during the swelling process together with the hexadecyltrimethylammonium surfactant. Finally, the subnanometric Pt clusters were encaged within supercages of three-dimensional MCM-22 zeolites after all the organic species were removed by calcination under high temperatures. The Cs-corrected high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) measurements showed that the majority of Pt species were in form of atomically distributed Pt atoms and ultrafine Pt clusters with sizes in the range of 0.2–0.7 nm, which were anchored in the zeolite micropores (Fig. 3a), although several larger Pt nanoparticles could be also observed on the outside of zeolites. Based on the results of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements, the coordination number of the Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 was determined to be about 4.7, corresponding to Pt clusters with a size of less than 0.7 nm, composed of less than 13 Pt atoms (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the size of the Pt species in Pt/MCM-22-imp synthesized by the conventional impregnation method ranged from 1 to 5 nm. Both Pt@MCM-22 and Pt/MCM-22-imp were used as catalysts for both the propylene hydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation reactions. The hydrogenation rate of Pt@MCM-22 was 5-times higher than that of Pt/MCM-22-imp (Fig. 3c). During propane dehydrogenation at 550 °C, Pt@MCM-22 retained ∼90% of its initial activity, while Pt/MCM-22-imp lost more than 40% of its initial activity after 5 oxidation–reduction cycles, exhibiting the improved high-temperature stability of Pt@MCM-22 (Fig. 3d).

It is generally considered that the confinement effect of zeolites can greatly promote the catalytic performance of metal species and protect the active sites from sintering and poisoning, but this confinement effect may result in massive passivation effects in some cases. Xiao and coworkers prepared the Pt@NaX catalyst via an in situ synthetic method (Pt nanoparticles with an average size of 1.05 nm were encapsulated in zeolite crystals) and its Pt/NaX counterpart was synthesized via the impregnation method (Pt nanoparticles with an average size of 1.45 nm are located on the outside of the zeolites).55 The Pt/NaX catalyst exhibited remarkably higher propane conversion (9.92%) and propylene selectivity (67%) than the Pt@NaX catalyst (1.7% and 43%, respectively) in PDH reactions, and also showed about 11-fold enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF) compared with the Pt@NaX catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that the Pt clusters in Pt@NaX had a lower d-band center due to their encapsulation by the zeolitic frameworks, which are inferior to activate propane, resulting in a lower propane conversion. In addition, the surrounding zeolitic framework encapsulating the Pt species also suppressed the desorption of propylene, which is prone to deep dehydrogenation and coke formation, leading to a decrease in the selectivity towards propylene. Besides the aforementioned MWW and NaX zeolites, other zeolites such as ZSM-5 54 and silicalite-1 53 zeolites were also used as supports to anchor monometallic Pt species, achieving over 95% propylene selectivity.
2.2 Zeolite-supported non-noble monometal catalysts
Besides zeolite-supported Pt catalysts, some cost-effective zeolite-supported non-noble monometal catalysts (e.g., Ga,57,62,98,106–110 Sn,63 and Zn102,111) and non-noble monometal oxide catalysts (such as ZnO,45,56,61,65,66 CrOx,60 CoO,46,58 and VOx64,112,113) were also extensively studied for PDH reactions. Supported CrOx catalysts have been used for a long time in industrial PDH plants since 1964, one of which is the FBD-4 process that uses Al2O3 as a support.22 Recently, Yuan and coworkers developed a high-silica H-ZSM-5-supported CrOx catalyst with an SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260 (Cr/Z-5(260)) via the impregnation method using chromium nitrate as the metal precursor.60 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) elemental mapping measurements demonstrated that no large metal particles were present on the outside of the zeolite crystals, indicating that most of the Cr species were located within the zeolite matrix with a high dispersion (Fig. 4a–c). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements revealed that the Cr6+ species were the overwhelming majority in the Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst, which is attributed to the strong interactions between CrOx and the zeolite by forming Al–O–Cr and/or Si–O–Cr linkages. The 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst showed a high propylene yield of 45.2% after 5 h on stream, which is nearly 2- and 5-times higher than that of 5%Cr/Al2O3 (25.5%) and 5%Cr/SiO2 (9.6%). Significantly, the zeolite-supported CrOx catalysts maintained 32.6% propane conversion with 94.2% propylene selectivity under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.59 h−1 and a propylene formation rate of 4.1 mmol gcat−1 h−1 (WHSV = 0.59 h−1) after 50 h on stream, demonstrating their superior stability during the PDH reactions. In contrast, the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst lost 50% of its initial activity only after 5 h on stream. Besides the Cr species acting as active sites for the propane dehydrogenation, the Brønsted acid sites in the ZSM-5 zeolite could also increase the propane adsorption and enhance the C–H bond activation. However, too high concentration and strength of zeolite acidity could also cause deep dehydrogenation and cracking of propane, resulting in a decrease in propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation.

Although the Cr-based catalysts exhibit promising activity in PDH reactions, Cr species are highly toxic, which is a disadvantage for their industrial application due to the requirement of environmental protection. Thus, the development of non-noble metal catalysts with low toxicity and excellent activity is urgently required. Recently, several zeolite-supported Co catalysts have been developed and showed great promise in PDH reactions due to their efficient C–H activation ability, high propylene selectivity, and relatively cost-effective and environmentally friendly characteristics.46,58,114,115 Liu and co-workers encapsulated CoOx clusters within the micropore or framework of silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites through a one-pot ligand-protected crystallization method using Co-acetylacetonate (Co-acac@S-1) and Co-ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (Co-edta@S-1) as metal precursors, respectively.58 The aberration-corrected STEM (AC-STEM) measurements exhibited that the ultrasmall cobalt oxide clusters with an average size of approximately 0.7 nm were confined in the microporous channels of S-1 zeolite in the Co-acac@S-1 catalyst, which were much smaller than the Co species (3–5 nm) in the Co/S-1 catalyst synthesized via the impregnation method. However, no metal particles or clusters could be observed in the Co-edta@S-1 catalyst in the AC-STEM images at the same resolution. The EDS mapping images of the Co-edta@S-1 catalyst showed that the Co species were spread uniformly throughout the zeolite crystals, indicating that Co atoms were inserted into the framework of the S-1 zeolite (Fig. 4d–g). Based on the XPS analysis, most of the Co species in Co-acac@S-1 and Co-edta@S-1 were in the form of divalent cobalt, while both Co2+ and Co3+ species co-existed in the Co/S-1 catalyst. The PDH tests revealed that the Co-acac@S-1 catalyst exhibited high propane conversion (47%) with a propylene selectivity of about 94.7% at 600 °C under a WHSV of 0.4 h−1. In contrast, the Co-edta@S-1 catalyst only exhibited 4% propane conversion, which was much lower than that of the impregnated Co/S-1 catalyst (43%) (Fig. 4h). The TOF values of propylene formation rate for Co-acac@S-1, Co/S-1, and Co-edta@S-1 were 13.66, 8.43 and 0.35 mmol C3H6 gcat−1 h−1, corresponding to 30.26, 15.10, and 2.63 h−1, respectively (Fig. 4i and j). In addition, Co-acac@S-1 possessed the lowest apparent activation energies (Ea) value among the catalysts, demonstrating its low dehydrogenation barrier (Fig. 4k). The above-mentioned results revealed that the Co species supported on zeolite matrix are responsible for propane dehydrogenation, whereas the isolated Co2+ species in the zeolite frameworks barely possessed catalytic activity. The DFT calculation demonstrated that the CoO clusters could promote propylene desorption and prevent an over-dehydrogenation reaction, affording excellent catalytic performance in PDH reactions, while the isolated Co2+ sites in the zeolite frameworks possessed a higher dehydrogenation barrier than the CoO clusters due to the spatial restriction of the closed framework site, showing rather poor activity for the dehydrogenation of propylene. Besides zeolite-supported Co catalysts, other zeolite-supported non-noble monometal catalysts, such as ZnO/S-1,45 Zn/Beta,65 ZnO/Y,66 Zn/HZSM-5,61 Zn/S-1,56 Ga/H-ZSM-5,110 V/FAU,113 Ga/SiBEA,62 Ga/ZSM-5 59 and GaN/NaZSM-5 57 have also been developed and exhibited high performances in PDH reactions.
3. Zeolite-supported bimetal catalysts
Although monometallic Pt-based catalysts exhibit promising PDH activity, they still have some limitations. The large ensembles of monometal Pt surface atoms are active for the deep dehydrogenation of propane, causing the formation of coke and undesirable byproducts, resulting in fast deactivation and low selectivity for propylene. The performances of monometallic Pt catalysts are far from satisfactory in most cases. Thus, several methods have been developed to improve this situation. Constructing a bimetal system not only can modify the electronic structure state of the Pt species, but also be beneficial to increase the dispersion of Pt species, resulting in improved selectivity for propylene and conversion of propane. Besides, the introduction of another metal into Pt species can also remarkably enhance their long-term stability in PDH reactions by preventing coking and sintering of the catalyst.116–119 Recently, several zeolite-supported Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt–Sn,67 Pt–Zn,48,50 Pt-rare-earth element (REE),47 and Pt–Ga,92 have been reported and exhibited excellent selectivity for propylene and superior stability compared with their monometallic Pt counterparts. Moreover, zeolite-supported non-noble bimetal catalysts (e.g., Ni–Zn@S-1 and Zn–In/HZSM-5) have also been developed with attractive activity in the PDH reaction, especially outstanding propylene selectivity.95,96 In the next few paragraphs, we introduce these zeolite-supported bimetal catalysts in detail.
3.1 Zeolite-supported Pt–Sn catalysts
Supported Pt–Sn catalysts have been widely applied in industrial production since 1990, but were not introduced on zeolites (ZSM-5) until the late 1990s.120 Before that, alumina was always the ideal support for Pt–Sn alloy, and as-made catalysts could achieve 30% propane conversion and 75% propylene selectivity, but this was not satisfactory for researchers. Thus, the development of high-performance supported Pt–Sn catalysts has always been the pursuit of researchers. Recently, some well-designed zeolite-supported Pt–Sn catalysts have shown excellent catalytic performances in PDH reactions. Corma and coworkers employed a one-pot ligand-protected method to encapsulate Pt–Sn clusters inside K+ ion-containing silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites using H2PtCl6 and SnCl4 as metal precursors and ethylenediamine as a ligand-protecting agent, which were subjected to calcination and reduction procedures (Fig. 5a).49 High-resolution HAADF-STEM and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) measurements revealed that the Pt–Sn clusters of K-PtSn@MFI were 0.4–0.6 nm in size and preferred to stay in the intersectional sinusoidal channels of the S-1 zeolite, and most of the Pt and Sn atoms were located adjacent to each other, indicating the formation of the PtSn alloy structure (Fig. 5b). Based on the XANES and EXAFS results, both PtSn@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI had Pt species in the metallic state and the Sn species were located outside the zeolite in form of SnOx clusters. The coordination number (CN) of the Pt–Pt bonds was 6.4 in K-PtSn@MFI, which was smaller than that in the K-free PtSn@MFI (10.7), indicating that the introduction of K+ ions in the zeolites was conducive to the dispersion of metal species and reducing the metal size. PtSn@MFI exhibited significantly enhanced PDH activity at 600 °C with 65% propane conversion and over 95% propylene selectivity compared to Pt@S-1 (34% and 57%, respectively), which is attributed to the positive modulation of Pt reactivity by Sn. The introduction of K+ ions could remarkably enhance the stability during the PDH reaction, where more than 40% propane conversion was maintained with a slight decrease in propylene selectivity even after 65 h on stream over K-PtSn@S-1, while PtSn@MFI lost 1/3 of its initial activity within 20 h. In addition, the high catalytic activity of K-PtSn@S-1 could be maintained even after 3 reaction-regeneration cycles without apparent deactivation, while PtSn@S-1 lost 2/3 of its initial activity under the same number of cycles. Subsequently, Corma and coworkers further investigated the zeolite-supported Pt–Sn catalytic system for PDH reactions and found that the subtle changes in the structure of the PtSn clusters confined in the zeolite could significantly influence their performance for propane dehydrogenation.67 The Pt–Sn clusters consisting of a few Pt and Sn atoms through Pt–O–Sn bonding were formed gradually with the transformation of the atomically dispersed Pt and Sn(iv) atoms to Pt clusters and SnOx species during the reduction under an H2 atmosphere, respectively, and the confinement effect of zeolite benefited the formation of bimetallic Pt–Sn clusters (Fig. 5c). In addition, a long reduction treatment at high temperatures (e.g., 600 °C) was necessary to form bimetallic Pt–Sn clusters. An extension in the reduction time could enhance the Pt–Sn interactions and modify the hydrocarbon adsorption, causing the byproducts and coke to be hardly adsorbed by the active center, and therefore avoided deep dehydrogenation or hydrogenolysis, giving a better performance in propylene selectivity and stability during the PDH process.121 Besides K+ ions, the rare-earth element Ce could also promote the catalytic activity of zeolite-supported Pt–Sn catalysts. Zhang et al. employed the Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolite to support the Pt–Sn nanoparticles.72 The introduction of Ce species in the catalysts not only stabilized the metallic active sites and made more Sn species remain in the oxidative state, improving the interaction between the Sn species and zeolite, but also decreased the acid strength of the zeolite and facilitated the migration of coke from the metal species to the zeolite. The optimized PtSnNa/Ce (0.76%) ZSM-5 catalyst achieved 43.5% propane conversion and 96.87% propylene selectivity, which were over 3% higher than that of its Ce-free counterpart.

Besides the 10-membered-ring MFI zeolite, the Beta zeolite with 12-membered rings was also used to support Sn–Pt species for PDH applications. A post-synthesis strategy has been commonly used to prepare Beta-supported Pt–Sn catalysts. The H-beta zeolite is first dealuminated with concentrated nitric acid aqueous solution, and then Sn atoms are incorporated in the zeolite framework via the ion-exchange method or reaction of dealuminated Beta with Sn-containing salts. Subsequently, the Pt species are introduced in Sn-Beta via the impregnation method and the Beta-supported Pt–Sn catalysts can be finally obtained during the reduction treatment in an H2 atmosphere (Fig. 6a).78,79,81 During the dealumination procedure, some silanol nests are formed, which can act as anchors to embed the Sn and Pt species with high dispersions. In addition, the confined Sn species in zeolites can also remarkably promote the dispersion of Pt clusters and form strong interactions between the Sn and Pt species, greatly enhancing the catalytic activity in PDH reactions. Recently, Wu and co-workers implemented a structural reconstruction route coupled with the impregnation method to prepare Sn-Beta-encapsulated ultrasmall Pt cluster catalysts.78Cs-Correct HAADF-STEM measurements showed that highly dispersed Pt clusters and Pt atoms were encapsulated in the zeolite crystals (Fig. 6b and c). Based on the 119Sn NMR, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and in situ XPS measurements, monodispersed precursors (Si–O)3(H2O)2Sn(iv)–(O)–[PtCl5]− and the final active site of (Si–O)2Sn(ii)–(O)–Pt(1–15) were formed after the impregnation and reduction procedure, respectively. The obtained Pt–Sn-Beta-R catalyst subjected to direct H2 reduction exhibited 47% propane conversion and over 99% propylene selectivity even after 85 h on stream at 500 °C, which is much better than that with the Pt–Sn-Beta-CR sample prepared via calcination-reduction with large amounts of larger metal nanoparticles on the outside of zeolites. In contrast, the monometallic Pt–Si-Beta-R and Pt–Al2O3-R catalysts only exhibited approximately 25% propane conversion with a relatively low selectivity of propylene (less than 90%) after 10 h on stream (Fig. 6d and e, respectively). The strong interaction between Pt species and framework Sn species largely inhibited the aggregation of Pt species and retarded the coke deposition rate, and the synergy of bimetallic Pt–Sn was responsible for the high propylene selectivity. Moreover, Pt–Sn-Beta-R exhibited great anti-sintering and anti-coking ability and superior long-term stability, maintaining 90% of its initial activity after 410 h of continuous reaction. Besides Beta,78–81 ZSM-5 69–75,122 and silicalite-1,49,67,68 some other zeolites, such as SAPO-34,77,82,83,123 TS-1,76,124 and SUZ-4,84 have also been used as supports to fabricate Pt–Sn catalysts for PDH reactions and achieved attractive catalytic performances.

3.2 Zeolite-supported Pt–Zn catalysts
Besides Pt–Sn species, bimetallic Pt–Zn species supported by zeolites also exhibit splendid performances during PDH processes. Yu and co-workers developed a ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method for the encapsulation of subnanometric Pt–Zn clusters in silicalite-1 zeolites using Pt(en)2Cl2 and Zn(en)3(CH3COO)2 (en = ethylenediamine) complexes as metal precursors (Fig. 7a).48 Different from the previously used calcination-reduction treatments for removing the organic templates and ligands in zeolites, in this work, the direct H2 reduction process was implemented for the hydrogenolysis of the organic species and reduction of the metal species simultaneously. The organic species in the zeolites could significantly inhibit the aggregation of metal species, resulting in the formation of ultrasmall metal clusters with high dispersions. The Cs-corrected STEM measurements demonstrated that well-dispersed subnanometric Pt–Zn clusters were encapsulated in the intersectional void spaces of the MFI zeolite, and the introduction of metal species did not break the structure of the zeolite (Fig. 7b–g). In contrast, the size of the metal nanoparticles in Pt@S-1-C synthesized via the calcination-reduction method and Pt/S-1 catalyst prepared via the impregnation method was around 2.7 and 6.4 nm, respectively. Based on XANES and EXAFS, the average CNs of the Pt–Pt bonds in PtZn4@S-1-H with a Pt/Zn ratio of 1/4 was only 1.5–2.1, indicating that the Pt species were highly dispersed and consisted of a small number of Pt atoms. Most of the Zn species were in the form of single-site Zn2+ ions connected with Pt and Si atoms via three bridging O atoms and also formed some Pt–Zn alloy structures. The optimized PtZn4@S-1-H exhibited superhigh propylene selectivity of 99.3% with 47.4% initial propane conversion at 550 °C (WHSV = 3.6 h−1), which was much higher than that of monometallic Pt@S-1-H (79% propylene selectivity) due to the synergistic effect of the bimetallic Pt–Zn species. The electronic density around the Pt atoms increased with the introduction of Zn atoms and the electron-enriched Pt species were beneficial for the adsorption of propane, showing a positive effect on the catalytic performance. Moreover, the bimetallic Pt–Zn species could also enhance the desorption of propylene and suppress the formation and polymerization of unsaturated coke precursors, resulting in extraordinary propylene selectivity and stability during the PDH process. The single-site Zn ions also played an important role in the stabilization of the metal species. The optimized PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited excellent long-term stability and no obvious deactivation even after 13 000 min on stream with a WHSV of 3.6 h−1, affording a low deactivation constant of 0.001 h−1, which was 200-times less than that of the PtZn4/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 7h). In addition, the introduction of Cs+ cations was found to remarkably improve the regeneration stability of the catalysts. After four continuous cycles, the catalytic activity of PtZn4@S-1-H-Cs remained unchanged. This could be mainly attributed to the fact that the Cs+ ions were located inside the zeolite channels, preventing the migration of the metal species during the thermal regeneration processes under high temperatures and avoiding their aggregation and/or leaching.

Besides small Pt–Zn clusters without crystalline structures, the Pt–Zn intermetallic alloys (IMA) also exhibited excellent catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation. Liu and co-workers prepared Pt–Zn IMA nanoparticles in silicalite-1 zeolites by introducing Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2 in the initial synthesis gel of the zeolites.87 XANES and EXAFS measurements revealed that each Pt atom was surrounded by about seven Zn atoms, which was very close to that in Pt1Zn1 IMA with eight Zn atoms surrounding the isolated Pt atoms. The TEM measurements showed that the mean size of the Pt–Zn nanoparticles was approximately 2.4 nm and the lattice spacing of the Pt–Zn nanoparticles was 0.221 nm, which matched the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of Pt1Zn1 IMA (P4/mmm). The zeolite-supported Pt–Zn IMA catalysts exhibited a high initial propane conversion of 46.6% with a propylene selectivity of 99.2% and a low deactivation constant of 0.003 h−1 (WHSV = 5.9 h−1), which was 6-fold lower than the deactivation constant of the industrial Pt–Sn catalyst. The theoretical calculation revealed that the propylene desorption over PtZn IMA was greatly facilitated compared to its monometal Pt and bimetal Pt3Zn counterparts, and this advantage was responsible for achieving the high propylene selectivity and long-term stability.
The morphology and defect structures of zeolites also play an important role in the dispersion of Pt–Zn species and affect the catalytic activity in PDH reactions. Ryoo and co-workers developed a 1Pt1Zn/MZ nanosheet catalyst via the co-impregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2 on a pure silica MFI nanosheet, which was prepared using [C18H37-N+(Me)2-C6H12-N+(Me)2-C4H9]Br

as a micro-mesopore dual structure-directing agent.88 Well-dispersed and small Pt–Zn IMA nanoparticles with an average size of 3 nm were formed in the 1Pt1Zn/MZ catalyst with the assistance of the zeolite silanols (Fig. 7i and j), which were much smaller than that of the 1Pt1Zn/BZ catalyst (bulk zeolite-supported Pt–Zn species via impregnation method). The ultrathin morphology of the zeolite was not only beneficial for improving the metal dispersion, but also conducive to the formation of Pt–Zn IMA. The intermetallic compound-type Pt–Zn alloy structure could not be obtained when MCM-48 and silica gel were used as supports under the same synthetic procedure. The 0.7Pt0.7Zn/BZ catalyst exhibited extraordinary long-term stability, where the propane conversion only dropped to half of its initial value after 20 days on stream at 580 °C with a WHSV of 13 h−1 and its propylene selectivity remained as high as 98%, while its 1Pt1Zn/BZ, 1Pt1Zn/MCM-48, 1Pt1Zn/silica gel, and 1Pt1Zn/Al2O3 counterparts lost their activity sharply in a short time (Fig. 7k). The STEM analysis of the spent 1Pt1Zn/MZ catalyst revealed that the size of metal particles was the same as that of the fresh catalyst, indicating that coking was the major reason for the deactivation. Subsequently, 75% of the initial activity could be restored over the 1Pt1Zn/MZ catalyst after 5 regeneration cycles, and the main reason for the catalytic activity loss was the sintering of PtZn nanoparticles during the regeneration procedure.
Recently, Bell and coworkers developed a Pt–Zn-DeAlBEA catalyst with atomically dispersed Pt atoms stabilized in the nests of Zn atoms located within the pores of the dealuminated Beta zeolite.50 The HAADF-STEM measurements revealed that the isolated Pt atoms were uniformly located in the zeolite surrounded by several Zn atoms. Based on the XANES and EXAFS results, the as-made catalyst exhibited auto-reduction ability upon heating to 823 K in flowing He and only a single Pt–Zn scattering path was detected. The average number of Zn atoms coordinated to a Pt atom was in the range of 4 to 6 and the Pt–Pt bond was almost invisible, which indicated that the Pt species was atomically dispersed and bonded in the form of (Si–O–Zn)4–6Pt complexes. The Pt–Zn-DeAlBEA catalyst exhibited a high propane conversion (32%) and propylene selectivity (>99%) over 12 h on stream at 550 °C and under a WHSV of 1477 h−1 (based on Pt atoms), while the monometallic 0.04Pt-DeAlBEA catalyst only exhibited 2.4% propane conversion with 94% propylene selectivity. The Pt–Zn-DeAlBEA catalyst also exhibited outstanding long-term stability with the loss of only 10% of its initial activity after 160 h on stream and excellent regenerability that its full catalytic activity could be recovered after 3 consecutive regenerations. The high stability in PDH reactions of the Pt–Zn-DeAlBEA catalyst was attributed to the strong interaction of Pt atoms with multiple SiO–Zn–OH groups, which could remarkably inhibit the sintering of the Pt atoms.
Besides siliceous zeolites, the doping of heteroatoms in zeolite frameworks can also have a positive influence on the catalytic PDH activity of catalysts. Su and coworkers developed titanium-silicate zeolite-supported Pt–Zn catalysts (PtZn/0.02TS-1) by impregnating Pt and Zn species in TS-1 (Ti/Si = 0.02, MFI zeotype) zeolites.86 The Ti atoms in the zeolite frameworks could greatly increase the dispersion of Pt atoms, modify the electronic density of the Pt atoms together with Zn species, and also be conducive to strong interactions with Pt and Zn, forming bimetallic Pt–Zn species. PtZn/0.02TS-1 exhibited 47.3% initial propane conversion at 600 °C under a WHSV of 48 h−1, which was 20% higher than that with PtZn/S-1. In addition, the introduction of Ti atoms in the zeolite framework was also beneficial for decreasing the amount of undesirable isolated silanol groups, improving the durability of the catalysts in the PDH reactions.
3.3 Zeolite-supported Pt–REE catalysts
Rare-earth element (REE) oxides have been considered excellent stabilizers for dispersing ultra-small Pt species because of their strong metal-support interactions with Pt species.125 Although lots of efforts have been devoted to alloying transition metal elements with platinum, platinum alloying with REEs has barely been reported due to the low chemical potential of REE oxides, which are difficult to be reduced through the conventional H2 reduction route.126 Ryoo and co-workers performed a pioneering work on the synthesis of a series of Pt–REE catalysts based on a siliceous MFI zeolite with hierarchically micro/mesoporous layered structures through a post-treatment strategy involving the degallation of mesoporous MFI gallosilicate zeolite (mz-deGa).47 The silanol nests in the layered zeolites played a crucial role in the formation of REE-platinum alloys, which could enable the REEs to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of bulk REE oxides, making it easier for them to diffuse onto the Pt species. The atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM images revealed that the mean size of the Pt–Y (Y = yttrium) intermetallic compound nanoparticles was about 3 nm and every column of Y atoms was neighbored by 8 columns of Pt atoms viewed along the [100] direction, indicating the formation of Pt–Y alloy structures with an atomic composition of Pt3Y (Fig. 8a–c). Besides Pt–Y, other Pt–REE alloys, such as Pt–La and Pt–Ce could be also formed by H2 reduction at high temperature and stabilized on mz-deGa zeolites. The PDH tests showed that PtLa/mz-deGa exhibited the highest initial conversion of ∼40% and over 96% propylene selectivity, which were much higher than that commercial PtSn/alumina with less than 36% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity. The surface silanol nests played a key role in enabling La alloying with Pt at the atomic level, which was responsible for the exceptional PDH performance. In contrast, the PtLa/mz catalyst prepared by impregnating Pt and La precursors in conventional mesoporous zeolites exhibited low propane conversion (22%) and rapid deactivation with ∼80% loss in its initial propane conversion within 1.5 h because the bimetallic species failed to form the Pt–La alloyed structure. PtLa/mz-deGa showed excellent long-term stability, maintaining nearly half of its initial propane conversion even after 20 days on stream, while the PtSn/alumina rapidly lost its catalytic activity within one day (Fig. 8d and e).

Subsequently, Ryoo and coworkers pushed their research one step further. They developed a direct route to synthesize the mesoporous MFI zeolite with large amounts of silanol nests under sodium-free conditions using [C18H37-N(CH3)2C6H12-N(CH3)2-C4H9]Br2 and tetraethyl orthosilicate as the structure-directing agent and silica source, respectively.91 The obtained sodium-free mesoporous MFI zeolite (MZ-sf) acted as an effective support to anchor Pt–Y alloys via the co-impregnation strategy, followed by the calcination–reduction procedure. The HAADF-STEM measurements revealed that the Pt3Y alloy was uniformly dispersed throughout the sodium-free mesoporous zeolites with an average size of 2 nm (Fig. 8f–h), while the Pt–Y alloy could not be formed on the sodium-containing mesoporous zeolites, possessing Y2O3 nanoparticles separated from Pt species. The as-made Pt–Y/MZ-sf-Br exhibited excellent durability with only 16% decrease in its initial propane conversion (42%) after 30 days on stream and more than 95% selectivity toward propylene, which was comparable with the aforementioned PtLa/mz-deGa catalyst. The simplification of the synthetic procedure brings great convenience and may become a universal way to synthesize other zeolites with silanol nests to anchor metal species.
3.4 Other zeolite-supported Pt-based bimetal catalysts
In addition to Sn, Zn, and REE as promoters of Pt species to improve the PDH performance, other zeolite-supported Pt-based bimetal catalysts, such as Pt–Ga and Pt–Cu, have also been developed and exhibited good activity for propane dehydrogenation.92–94 Recently, Liu and co-workers prepared PtGa@MFI catalysts through a one-pot ligand-protected crystallization method using Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and Ga(NO3)3 as metal precursors.92 HR-TEM measurements demonstrated that the size of the PtGa nanoparticles was around 2.8 nm, which was much smaller than the impregnated sample PtGa/S-1 (6.7 nm). This was also confirmed by the EXAFS results. The PDH tests showed that the bimetallic PtGa@MFI catalyst had high propylene selectivity of up to 98% at 600 °C, while the propylene selectivity of the monometallic Pt@MFI was only 95%. Theoretical calculations confirmed that the desorption energy of the C3H6* intermediate on the Pt–Ga surface sharply decreased compared to that on the Pt surface, which was also lower than the energy needed for C–H scission, leading to high propylene selectivity. Coincidentally, Yuan and co-workers also developed a silicalite-1 zeolite-supported Pt–Ga catalyst via a similar in situ ligand-protected crystallization method by adding [Pt(en)2]Cl2 and [Ga(en)3](NO3)3 to the synthesis gel of the zeolites.93 The Pt–Ga species encapsulated in the silicalite-1 zeolite could be barely observed in the TEM images, but EDS mapping measurement confirmed the existence of uniformly distributed Pt and Ga elements throughout zeolite crystals. The PtGa@S-1 catalyst achieved 45% propane conversion with 92.1% propylene selectivity, which was twice that of Pt@S-1. CO-DRIFT and XPS confirmed that the doping of Ga made the surface of Pt more electron-enriched, which was beneficial for the desorption of propylene, resulting in high propylene selectivity. The PtGa@S-1 catalyst also demonstrated an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0068 h−1 during the PDH reaction, which could be mainly attributed to the electron transfer from Ga to Pt, which prevented the adsorption of the products and beneficial for the fast migration of coke out of the active sites. Zhang et al. reported that encapsulated Pt–Cu alloy nanoparticles in silicalite-1 zeolites have enhanced coke-resistant ability and improved propylene selectivity (93.2%) compared to their Pt@S-1 counterpart, but the Pt–Cu nanoparticles seemed to not be sufficiently stable and metal aggregation occurred easily, resulting in relatively quick deactivation.94
3.5 Zeolite-supported non-noble bimetal catalysts
Besides zeolite-supported Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, some zeolite-supported non-noble bi-metal catalysts have also been developed for PDH reactions.59,95,96 Although some non-noble metals possess activity for propane dehydrogenation, sometimes their propylene selectivity is not satisfactory due to their strong tendency towards C–C hydrogenolysis. The fabrication of non-noble bimetal systems can modify the electronic state of each non-noble metal species and suppress the hydrogenolysis of C–C bonds of propane, resulting in high activity in PDH reactions. Zu and co-workers reported Ni–Zn bimetallic catalysts located in the silicalite-1 framework via a ligand-protected strategy using [Ni(EDA)2](NO3)2 and [Zn(EDA)3](NO3)2 (EDA = triethylamine) as precursors.95 Based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), a new IR absorption band at 1452 cm−1 was observed for the representative monometallic Ni–S-1 and Zn–S-1, and bimetallic 0.2Ni0.06Zn–S-1 compared with pure zeolites, indicating that the Ni and Zn species were anchored in the zeolites. CO-FTIR, H2-TPR, H2 pulse chemisorption, XPS, and UV-Vis measurements revealed that the Ni and Zn were in the form of divalent species anchored on the zeolite framework, and the introduction of Zn species could enhance the electronic density of Ni species. The PDH tests were performed at 600 °C with a WHSV of 7.4 h−1 over various obtained zeolite-supported metallic catalysts. The optimized bimetallic 0.2Ni0.06Zn–S-1 achieved 32.5% propane conversion and 90.3% propylene selectivity. In contrast, the 0.2Ni–S-1 and 0.2Zn–S-1 catalysts only exhibited 20% and 5% propane conversion and 84.8% and less than 70% propylene selectivity, respectively. Moreover, both the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 0.2Ni–S-1 decreased to 8% and 67.1% after 8 h on stream, respectively, while 0.2Ni0.06Zn–S-1 maintained over 20% of conversion and its propylene selectivity remained almost unchanged. The decreased activity over the catalysts could be mainly attributed to the formation of cokes rather than Ni sintering due to the high-temperature stability of the Niδ+ and Znδ+ sites. Compared to the monometallic Ni–S-1 catalysts, the bimetallic 0.2Ni0.06Zn–S-1 demonstrated a relatively lower deactivation rate of 0.0778 h−1 and a good propylene formation rate of 4.3 mol g−1Ni h−1, which is mainly attributed to the formation of electron-enriched Niδ+ species, benefitting the desorption of propylene. In addition, when the ratio of Ni/Zn was 3/1, the catalytic performance was optimal, whereas the excessive introduction of Zn species led to the over-cracking of propane and reduced the propylene selectivity. Zhang and co-workers developed a ZnIn/HZSM-5 catalyst for PDH via the wetness impregnation method using indium nitrate and zinc nitrate as the metal precursors.96 The XPS analysis revealed that In3+ and Zn(OH)+ cations existed in the catalysts and acted as active sites for coupling propane with CO2 to form propylene. An enhanced propylene selectivity of 67.8% and yield of 12.2% were obtained over the bimetallic ZnIn/HZSM-5 compared to monometallic Zn/HZSM-5 with a propylene yield of only 5%.
4. Zeolite-supported single-site catalysts
Besides zeolite-supported monometallic and bimetallic nanoparticles and/or clusters, zeolite-supported single-site catalysts, such as Ga, Co, and Zn, have also been investigated for the dehydrogenation of propane. Bell and co-workers adopted a vapor-phase exchange strategy to synthesize Ga/H-MFI catalysts and deeply investigate the mechanism and kinetics of the dehydrogenation and cracking of C3H8 over the obtained catalysts.51 All the Ga species over Ga/H-MFI (Ga/Al = 0.05–0.3) existed as isolated cationic species. The dehydrogenation and cracking rates of propane over Ga/H-MFI (Ga/Al = 0.2) were 500 and 20-times higher than the corresponding rates over H-MFI under the same conditions. Both rates were independent of the Ga/Al ratio when the concentration of the [GaH]2+ cation in the catalysts was normalized, indicating that the [GaH]2+ cation was the active center for both the dehydrogenation and cracking reactions. In addition, H2 could react with the [GaH]2+ cation to form a [GaH2]+-H+ cation pair, which inhibited both the dehydrogenation and cracking rates of propane over the Ga/H-MFI catalysts. Tang and co-workers developed a catalyst using silicalite-1 as a support to incorporate atomically dispersed Co2+ species for PDH reactions.103 The preparation of Co–S-1 involved conventional hydrothermal synthesis using cobalt nitrate as the metal precursor in the presence of ammonia to prevent the precipitation of Co(OH)2. In the TEM measurements, no obvious Co nanoparticles could be observed in Co–S-1, indicating the atomic-level dispersion of Co species. The H2-TPR results illustrated that it was difficult for the Co species in Co–S-1 to be reduced, which could be attributed to the incorporation of Co species in the zeolite frameworks and the formation of Si–O–Co structure. The X-ray adsorption spectrum demonstrated that the valence of Co species in Co–S-1 was +2 and the coordination number of the Co–O bond was 4.34 and no Co–Co metal bond was detected, further indicating that Co species mainly existed as isolated tetracoordinate Co2+ sites in the zeolite skeleton. The Co–S-1 catalyst exhibited a propane conversion of 20.0% and selectivity for propylene of 99.3%, which are much higher than that of the control catalysts synthesized by the impregnation method (16.6% and 93.1%) (Fig. 9a and b), respectively. It is notable that even after 1040 min on stream, the propane conversion of Co–S-1 remained almost unchanged. Thermogravimetry analysis showed that the spent Co–S-1 catalyst had a weight loss as low as 2.04%, which afforded an extremely low deactivation rate constant of 0.00065 h−1, reflecting its outstanding long-term stability. Single-site Zn catalysts have also been widely investigated due to their relatively low cost and low toxicity.102,127,128 Recently, Li and co-workers reported the stabilization of single-site zinc inside the silicalite-1 zeolite (Zn@S-1) via the in situ hydrothermal method by introducing the [Zn(en)3]2+ complex in the synthesis gel.102 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 29Si magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR) and XPS measurements revealed that atomically dispersed Zn2+ species were trapped and stabilized by the Si–OH groups in Zn@S-1. In contrast, ZnOx nanoparticles with a size of 2–5 nm were observed in its Zn/S-1 counterpart synthesized via the impregnation method. Zn@S-1 exhibited a high propylene space–time yield of 24 mmolC3H6 gcat−1 h−1 and 97% propylene selectivity under a WHSV of 4.8 h−1 at 853 K in the PDH reaction, which was remarkably higher compared to that of its Zn/S-1 counterpart (Fig. 9c). However, the catalytic activity of Zn@S-1 sharply decreased after prereduction in an H2 atmosphere, indicating that the single-site zinc cations were the preferred active sites during the PDH process rather than the metallic zinc species. The catalytic activity was enhanced with an increase in the Zn loading in the zeolite, but the introduction of too many Zn species could also lead to a degradation in activity. Accordingly, it was found that the Zn loading of∼4% was optimal for Zn@S-1 in the PDH reaction (Fig. 9d). In situ near-ambient pressure XPS and ex situ XPS measurements revealed that Zn2+ could be partially reduced to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species during the PDH process, which also acted as active sites for the dehydrogenation of propane.

Besides single-site metal species, single-site non-metal species (e.g., boron) also possess catalytic activity for PDH reactions.100,101 Boron-containing catalysts (such as BN, supported boron oxide and B-MWW) have been discovered to have the ability to catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).101,129–131 B–O–B oligomers are considered as the active centers, which can suppress the over oxidation of propane and hinder the formation of coke. However, as the reaction proceeds, the B–O–B sites are easily damaged by water and change into boric acid, which dampens the catalysts once the boric acid leaks out of the catalytic system. Thus, considering the above-mentioned problems, Xiao and co-workers developed a boron-containing MFI zeolite (BS-1) with a Si/B ratio of about 62 through a solvent-free method using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide as a template.100 The BS-1 catalyst achieved a high propane conversion of 23.8% at 540 °C, which is about 2.8- and 12-times higher than that of the B/SiO2 (8.5%) and B/S-1 (1.9%) catalysts synthesized via the impregnation method, respectively. Significantly, a superhigh propane conversion of up to 41.4% could be achieved over the BS-1 catalyst at 560 °C with propylene and ethene selectivities of 54.9% and 26.3%, respectively. During the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, CO2 was the major product due to overoxidation. Excellent olefin selectivity (>81.2%) was obtained over the BS-1 catalyst at any propane conversion, which was higher than that of the typical h-BN catalyst (79.9%). After 210 h on stream, the BS-1 catalyst still exhibited 43.7% propane conversion, with propylene and ethene selectivity of 53.3% and 29.5%, respectively, demonstrating the superior stability of the BS-1 catalyst in the ODHP. The 2D 1H–1H double quantum MAS NMR measurements revealed that the hydrolysis of the Si–O–B linkage was reversible and the deep hydrolysis of Si–O–B species and B leaching could be effectively inhibited during the ODHP process, showing an excellent property of water tolerance. Based on an intensive NMR study coupled with in situ FTIR investigation, the –B[OH⋯O(H)–Si]2 structure in the BS-1 catalyst was identified as the active site, which could efficiently active both oxygen molecules and C–H bond of propane in the ODHP reactions. Moreover, the theoretical modeling revealed that the confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structures could also improve the reaction activity.
5. Conclusions and perspectives
Over the last five years, zeolite-supported metal catalysts have achieved great progress and shown tremendous potential for the PDH application, but there is still room for improvement and problems to solve. Thus, the development of novel and facile synthesis strategies to prepare zeolite-supported metal catalysts with high PDH performances is fundamental to promote the prosperity and progress in this field. The metal species prepared via the impregnation method are usually located on the outside of zeolites and suffer from severe agglomeration and rapid deactivation during PDH reactions. In contrast, the metal species prepared via the one-pot synthesis strategy are more easily encapsulated in the interior of zeolites, showing significantly improved thermal stability and catalytic performance in PDH reactions. The zeolite-encapsulated metal catalysts prepared via the one-pot synthesis method have gradually become a hot topic for PDH reactions. However, to date, the one-pot synthesis method has only been successfully applied in purely siliceous MFI-supported metal catalysts for PDH reactions. Further development of one-pot synthesis strategies to enable metal species to be completely encaged in zeolites with various topological structures remains a challenge. The optimization of synthetic conditions and selection of suitable metal precursors to match zeolite structures are the key to realizing the confined synthesis of highly dispersed and stable metal species in zeolite matrices.
It should be noted that the confinement effect of zeolites is also a double-edged sword for PDH reactions. Undeniably, the confined spaces of zeolite micropores can prevent metal species from sintering and leaching, but they may also restrict the diffusion of the reactant and products, decreasing the transformation frequency. The introduction of secondary larger mesopores/macropores in microporous zeolites or the fabrication of nanosized zeolites will provide solutions for overcoming the problem of unsatisfactory transport efficiency. Besides control of the porous structure and zeolite morphology, the doping of suitable heteroatoms and the manufacture of defective sites may also offer new ideas for the fabrication of zeolite-supported metal catalysts with excellent catalytic performances in PDH reactions. The heteroatoms in zeolite frameworks sometimes possess certain redox properties, which can improve the propane conversion and propylene selectivity through the establishment of a synergist effect with the active metal species confined in the zeolite. Besides, heteroatoms and defects (e.g. silanol nests) can also serve as anchors to immobilize metal species, which may improve the dispersion and stability of metal species with a great positive impact on the PDH reactivity.
Besides catalytic activity and long-term stability, the stable regeneration of catalysts is also a crucial factor to determine their practical industrial applications. Although zeolite-supported metal catalysts exhibit excellent lifetimes in PDH reactions, in many cases, they often have unsatisfactory stability during high-temperature regeneration processes due to the weak interaction between the metal species and zeolites. The metal species easily migrate to the outer surface of zeolites and agglomerate seriously during high-temperature calcination to remove carbon depositions. Thus, the fabrication of multi-metal species and the introduction of alkali metal ions have been proven to be effective methods to improve the regeneration stability of zeolite-supported metal catalysts. The development of novel strategies to further improve the regeneration performance of these catalysts remains highly desirable. Recently, high-entropy alloys have attracted extensive attention due to their high-temperature stability and excellent catalytic performance.132 The encapsulation of high-entropy alloys into zeolite matrices may provide a new possible route to solve the unsatisfactory regeneration stability of zeolite-supported metal catalysts.
For industrial applications, not only the catalytic performance but also the cost of catalysts must be considered. Compared to alumina, which is the commonly used industrialized support for PDH processes, the synthetic costs of zeolites remain relatively expensive, especially for the synthesis of purely siliceous zeolites. Thus, the development of green and facile methods for the cost-effective and energy-saving synthesis of zeolites is highly desirable. Pt-Based catalysts possess excellent catalytic performances in PDH reactions and have been widely used in industrial processes. The improvement of the utilization rate of Pt species, such as the introduction of other elements to improve the dispersion of Pt species and the establishment of single-site Pt species, is also an effective way to reduce the cost. Non-noble metals and non-noble metal oxides have long been expected to be alternatives to Pt-based catalysts. However, the catalytic performances of the present non-noble metal-based catalysts are still far from satisfactory, particularly in terms of propane conversion. Recently, some single-site non-noble metal catalysts have exhibited remarkably improved catalytic activity for PDH reactions, and some of them even match the performance of Pt-based catalysts, showing a superior application prospect. Thus, further optimization of the synthesis strategy and preparation of cheap and high-performance zeolite-supported non-noble metal catalysts have great significance for future research.
Besides the direct dehydrogenation of propane, the thought of tandem catalysis by coupling propane dehydrogenation with the selective combustion of hydrogen (SCH) has also been considered as a promising way to drive the reaction forward.133,134 However, in many cases, the propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propylene over the present catalysts is still uncompetitive compared to the direct propane dehydrogenation process due to the over-oxidation of hydrocarbons. Thus, the development of novel zeolite-encaged metal catalytic systems by constructing metal species with cascade reactivity coupled with shape-selectivity of zeolites can be expected to achieve breakthroughs in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propylene.
The identification of the active sites and investigation of the structure–function relationship are of great scientific significance for understanding the mechanism of PDH reactions, which can also guide the design and preparation of catalysts with improved performance. Although the confinement effect of zeolites can significantly promote the stability of metal species, the size, location, structure, and electronic state of the metallic active sites always change during PDH reactions at high temperatures, which significantly affect the catalytic activity. Thus, the further development of advanced characterization technologies, especially in situ/operando characterization techniques, such as XAFS, XPS, DRIFTS, AC-STEM, iDPC-STEM, and Raman spectroscopy, will be of great help to provide direct evidence to analyze the structural changes in the catalysts and the evolution of carbon deposits, making the structure–function relationship and catalytic mechanism clear. In addition, theoretical calculation is also a powerful tool to investigate the catalytic mechanism by establishing a rational model of the transition state and active sites as well as determining the optimized reaction paths.
In this review, we presented a comprehensive summary of the latest research progress in the innovative synthesis of zeolite-supported metal catalysts and their outstanding catalytic activity in PDH reactions. Due to the excellent catalytic activity and extraordinary stability of zeolite-supported metal catalysts, they have brought a new trend of thought to the field of propane dehydrogenation. We believe that zeolite-supported metal catalysts will keep on flourishing in the future and have great prospect in practical PDH industrial application, further promoting the innovation and advances in this field. We hope that this review will provide a reference and give insights into the future design of highly efficient zeolite-supported metal catalysts for the PDH application.
