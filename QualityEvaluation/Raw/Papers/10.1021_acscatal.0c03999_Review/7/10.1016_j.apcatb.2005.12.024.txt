Abstract
For thermodynamic reasons, CO2 has always been considered as inert at mild reaction temperatures (300 8C). In this study, we show that CO2
may be used as a valuable compound for the catalytic combustion of methane (CCM), if ceria-based materials are used as support for the palladium
active phase. Adding CO2 in the feed signiﬁcantly improves performances of ceria-zirconia supported catalysts. On the contrary, catalytic
performances are inhibited on Pd/g-Al2O3. Inhibition can be avoided by mixing the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst with some CeO2 evidencing cooperation
phenomena between both catalysts. In situ DRIFTS experiments show that the inhibition of the alumina-supported catalyst is not due to formation
of carbonates species. After an in situ reducing pre-treatment, pure CO2 is able to rapidly oxidize reduced Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst at 300 8C.
Dissociation of CO2 on Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 would be responsible for the oxidation process. Thus, CO2 helps in replenishing the O reservoir (OSC) of the
Ce-Zr-O support which is normally consumed by reductants such as CH4, H2 or other HC’s. XPS experiments show enrichment in oxygen species
bound to Ce (Low BE O1s) on the surface of ceria-zirconia when working in the presence of CO2. Implications of these results on the behavior of
ceria-containing catalysts can be important for practical applications, e.g., in automotive exhaust catalysis.

1. Introduction
One of the major challenges of this century is certainly the
lowering of the emission levels of noxious and/or greenhouse
effect gases in the atmosphere. One way to reach this goal is to
develop the catalytic combustion (CC) process, which is known
to produce heat and energy with much lower emission levels of
CO, NOx and hydrocarbons (HC’s) than thermal combustion [1–
7]. A debated issue concerning the catalytic combustion of
methane (CCM) istheinﬂuence of the reactionproducts upon the
rate of the reaction. Many authors have investigated this point so
far but their conclusions vary in a more or less extended way [7–
15]. They all came to the conclusion that water produced during
the reaction has an inhibiting effect on the reaction, which is
reversible, since it disappears when water is removed from the
feed [7,10–15]. Nonetheless, it has been shown that the amount
of water effectively produced in real CCM conditions is too low
to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the reaction rate, as it is for CO2, the
other major product of the reaction [12].
The inﬂuence exerted by CO2 is more debated than the effect
of water [7,11,13,15]. Indeed, some authors consider CO2 as a
simple inert gas towards the CC reaction rate [15] while others
consider it to have an inhibiting effect which can only be
observed in the absence of water [7,11,13]. This dependence of
the inhibiting effect of CO2 on the presence of water logically
means that the inhibition of the reaction exerted by water is
stronger than that attributed to CO2. This statement can be
correlated to the experimental fact that CO2 desorbs before
water [8,10]. Most of these studies were carried out on Pd/
Al2O3 and/or Pd/ZrO2 catalysts. In all these experiments, CO2
has been considered as inert. This is logical because
thermodynamics disfavors the conversion of CO2 to O2 and
CO at mild temperature. For instance, the dissociation constant
(Kp) is only about 1017 at 427 8C. Thus, at such low
temperatures, it is assumed that the dissociation of gaseous CO2
is completely excluded and consequently, CO2 is traditionally
considered as inert. However, recent investigations in our
laboratory showed that it is possible to dissociatively activate

CO2 at low temperatures [16,17]. CO2 could dissociate on the
surface of the catalysts yielding highly oxidative O species
following the surface reaction: CO2(g) ! CO(ads) + O(a) [16].
The resulting oxygen species produced are suggested to play an
important role in oxidation reactions concerned with both
selective oxidation and combustion processes. In addition, we
have recently shown that the effective inﬂuence of the presence
of CO2 in the gaseous atmosphere actually depends on the type
of support of the palladium catalyst [18,19]. In particular, the
commonly used Pd/g-alumina catalyst is inhibited by the
presence of CO2, whereas the Pd/Ce-Zr-O catalyst is not
weakened under those conditions and can even display a better
behavior [18–20]. Some activating effects of CO2 can be
observed, as stated above, when using Pd/CexZr1xO2 catalysts
[18–20].
More
precisely,
results
indicated
that
the
Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 composition gives rise to the best ceria-zirconia
based catalysts and, what is more, that the activity of this
catalyst (like most of the ceria-zirconia supported palladium
catalysts) can be enhanced by the addition of some CO2 in the
reactant feed [19]. In this paper, we investigated more deeply
the causes and origin of the effective inﬂuence of CO2 on the
CCM process using a Pd/g-Al2O3, a Pd/CeO2 and a Pd/
Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, CeO2 and Ce2(CO3)3 materials and a
50/50 (w/w) mixture of Pd/g-Al2O3 and CeO2. For this purpose,
they were tested under reaction conditions with and without
CO2 in the CCM feed and characterized by BET, XPS and XRD
techniques. Moreover, in situ DRIFTS experiments were also
carried out to study the formation and stability of potential
adsorbed species.
2. Experimental
2.1. Samples preparation
2.1.1. CeO2 and Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 materials
CeO2 was synthesized by the citrates method: 50.458 g of
Ce(NO3)36H2O (Acros, 21869) were dissolved in distilled
water and 26.860 g of citric acid monohydrate (Merck, 100244)
were added to obtain a 10 wt.% excess over the stoichiometric
quantity so as to ensure the complete complexation of the metal
ion. Water was then evaporated under reduced pressure in a
rotavapor at 45 8C until the appearance of a gel or viscous
material. This material was dried overnight in a vacuum oven
set at 70 8C. The resulting spongy, highly hygroscopic citrate
was then calcined at 700 8C in air for 3.5 h. The Ce0.21Zr0.79O2
mixed oxide was obtained by the same method as for pure
CeO2, but using ZrO(NO3)2xH2O (x = 2.2) along with
Ce(NO3)36H2O, in appropriate quantities.
2.1.2. Supported Pd (2 wt.%) catalyst
A Pd (2 wt.%)/g-Al2O3 (65 m2 g1) catalyst was prepared
by the wet impregnation technique. In order to prepare 1 g of
sample, 980 mg of g-alumina (Alfa-Aesar 39812) and 50 mg
Pd(NH3)4Cl2H2O (Aldrich 32343-8) were both put into 350 ml
distilled water and the pH of the impregnation solution was
raised up to 10.6 by addition of a 25 vol.% solution of ammonia
(Merck, 1.05432). After stirring for 1 h, water was evaporated
under reduced pressure in a rotavapor (45 8C) and dried
overnight in an oven at 110 8C. Then, the sample was heated up
to 400 8C under O2 (Indugas 99.995%, 60 ml min1) and kept
1 h at this temperature. O2 was evacuated under a ﬂow of N2
(Indugas 99.996%, 60 ml min1) for 30 min and palladium was
reduced by means of a gaseous treatment under 5 vol.% H2 in
N2 (Indugas 60 ml min1) for 3 h at 400 8C. Finally, the
reduced catalyst was calcined for 3 h at 600 8C under air in a
mufﬂe furnace. The same procedure was followed to prepare
the Pd (2 wt.%)/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 (8 m2 g1) catalyst.
2.1.3. Physical mixture
The 50/50 physical mixture of CeO2 and the Pd (2 wt.%)/g-
Al2O3 catalyst was obtained by mixing 50 wt.% of each
material using a spatula.
2.1.4. Commercial products
Some experiments were also carried out with commercial
compounds: Ce2(CO3)3 (Aldrich, 32550-3), CeO2 (Janssen,
1991227) and Ce(CH3COO)3 (Aldrich, 36775-3).
2.2. Catalytic tests
Catalytic tests were performed in a conventional ﬁxed-bed
micro-reactor operated at atmospheric pressure. The reactor
was made of a stainless steel tube with an internal diameter of
8 mm into which 320 mg of the powdered catalyst (granulo-
metry: 100–315 mm) were introduced and covered with glass
beads (diameter > 800 mm) checked to be inactive under the
conditions of reaction used. The total ﬂow rate of the reactants
mixture was set at 100 ml min1 and helium (Indugas,
99.995%) was used as carrier gas. Two kinds of tests were
performed: (1) test of reference (TR), using 1 ml min1 of CH4
(Indugas 99.993%) and 10 ml min1 of O2 (Indugas 99.995%),
balanced with He (89 ml min1), and (2) test in the presence of
3 vol.% of CO2 (Indugas 99.998%) in the gaseous reactants
feed with 1 ml min1 of CH4, 10 ml min1 of O2 and
3 ml min1 of CO2, balanced with He (86 ml min1). The
reactor was inserted in a furnace which, in turn, was enclosed in
a heated box which ensured the heating of all the reacting
system, comprising lines and valves, at a temperature of
120 8C. The reaction was run between 200 and 550 8C and the
conversion of methane was measured every 50 8C in a stepwise
way with a holding time of 90 min at each temperature.
Analysis of reactants and products was performed by on-line
gas chromatography (Varian CP-3800) during the whole
catalytic test. Two chromatography columns were used for
this purpose: a CP-PoraPLOT Q 25 m  0.53 mm which
allows to separate H2, O2, CO and CH4 (forming one gross
peak) from CO2 and H2O; then, H2, O2, CH4 and CO are
resolved in a CP-Molsieve 5A 25 m  0.53 m. The detection
and quantiﬁcation of compounds were performed using a
thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
In order to compare the different experiments, the results
will be expressed in terms of T10, T30 and T50 values which are
the temperatures to be reached to obtain 10, 30 and 50% of
methane conversion, respectively.

2.3. Characterization
BET surface area was determined using a Micromeritics
FlowSorb II 2300 instrument by adsorption of nitrogen at
196 8C. A 200 mg sample, previously degassed at 150 8C
overnight under a ﬂow of a 70/30 vol.% mixture of helium and
nitrogen (Indugas), was used for the measurement.
XRD patterns were recorded on a Siemens D5000 diffract-
ometer using the Cu Ka radiation (l = 1.5418 A
˚ ). The 2u range
was scanned between 20 and 908 at a rate of 0.028 s1.
Identiﬁcation of the phases was achieved by using the ICDD-
JCPDS database.
XPS analyses were performed on a SSX 100/206 photo-
electron spectrometer from Surface Science Instruments (USA)
equipped with a monochromatized microfocus Al X-ray source
(powered at 20 mA and 10 kV), a 308 solid angle acceptance
lens, a hemispherical analyzer and a position sensitive detector.
The powder samples pressed in small stainless steel troughs of
4 mm diameter were placed on an insulating home-made
ceramic carousel (Macor, Switzerland) to avoid differential
charging effect. Moreover, a ﬂood gun set at 8 eVand a Ni grid
placed 3 mm above the sample surface and grounded to the
carousel support were used for charge stabilization [21]. The
pressure in the analysis chamber was around 106 Pa. The
angle between the surface normal and the axis of the analyzer
lens was 558. The analyzed area was approximately 1.4 mm2
and the pass energy was set at 150 eV. In these conditions, the
resolution determined by the full width at half maximum
(FWHM) of the Au 4f7/2 peak was around 1.6 eV. The binding
energies
were
calculated
with
respect
to
the
C-(C,H)
component of the C1s peak ﬁxed at 284.8 eV. Data treatment
was performed with the CasaXPS program (Casa Software,
Ltd., UK), the spectra were decomposed with the least squares
ﬁtting routine provided by the software with a Gaussian/
Lorentzian (85/15) product function and after substraction of a
non linear baseline [22]. Molar fractions were calculated using
peak areas normalized on the basis of acquisition parameters
and sensitivity factors provided by the manufacturer.
2.4. In situ DRIFTS experiments
In situ diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform
spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) spectra were collected on a
Bruker Equinox 55 infrared spectrometer equipped with an air
cooled MIR source with KBr optics and a MCT detector.
Spectra were obtained by collecting 200 scans with a resolution
of 4 cm1 and are presented in absorbance mode without any
manipulation. Figures are indicated by numbers while spectra
are referred to by letters.
Samples were placed without packing or dilution inside a
commercial controlled temperature and environment reﬂec-
tance cell (Spectra-Tech 0030-102) with ZnSe windows
coupled to the spectrometer. A ﬂow of He (Indugas
99.995%) was ﬁrst introduced into the cell for 1 h and the
spectrum of the original sample collected. Various experi-
ments using CH4 (Indugas 99.993%), O2 (Indugas 99.995%),
CO2 (Indugas 99.998%) and He were then performed at a total
ﬂow rate kept constant at 10 ml min1. The various conditions
used were:
(1) Standard CCM conditions: Heating up to 500 8C under
CCM reaction conditions (CH4/O2/He = 5/20/75 vol.) in a
50 8C stepwise way on both the Pd (2 wt.%)/g-Al2O3 and
the Pd (2 wt.%)/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalysts.
(2) CO2-rich conditions: Heating up to 500 8C under CO2-
containing CCM reaction conditions (CH4/O2/CO2/He = 4/
20/10/66 vol.) in a 50 8C stepwise way on both the Pd
(2 wt.%)/g-Al2O3
and
the
Pd
(2 wt.%)/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2
catalysts.
(3) Redox cycles: Feeding the Pd (2 wt.%)/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2
catalyst with O2, CO2 or He at 300 8C for various durations
after in situ reduction pre-treatments under H2 40 vol.%/He
at 350 8C for 1 h.
3. Results
3.1. Catalytic tests
The evolution of the conversion of CH4 as a function of the
temperature was followed for Pd/g-Al2O3 and Pd/CeO2
catalysts, for home-made CeO2 and commercial Ce2(CO3)3
materials, and for a 50/50 (w/w) mixture of Pd/g-Al2O3 and
CeO2, both in presence and absence of 3 vol.% CO2 in the CCM
feed. The light-off curves obtained are displayed in Fig. 1 and
the T10, T30 and T50 values of the catalysts and the mixture are
listed in Table 1. Results for the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst are
also mentioned. As can be seen, the presence of CO2 in the
feed has an inhibiting effect on the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst
(T50 = 430 8C versus 410 8C), but has no signiﬁcant effect on
either the Pd/CeO2 catalyst (T50 = 470 8C versus 465 8C) or the
(Pd/g-Al2O3 + CeO2) mixture (T50 = 400 8C versus 395 8C).
An activating effect was observed on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2
catalyst (T50 = 395 8C versus 405 8C). Obviously, the (Pd/g-
Al2O3 + CeO2) mixture is the most effective catalytic system

for the CCM reaction, whereas CeO2 and Ce2(CO3)3 materials
are not very active for the reaction. Moreover, they are both
strongly inhibited by the presence of CO2. Pure alumina was
previously checked to be inactive for the reaction in this
temperature range.
3.2. Characterization results
The BET surface areas of the different samples measured
before and after reaction are listed in Table 2. The Pd/g-Al2O3
catalyst is very stable and its surface area remains constant after
testing, with or without CO2 in the feed (61 and 62 m2 g1
versus 60 m2 g1, respectively). Similarly, XRD analyses do
not show any difference after the reaction. The home-made
CeO2 material is also very stable from a textural as well as from
a structural point of view. The SBET values of the (Pd/g-
Al2O3 + CeO2) mixture represent an intermediate situation
between the Pd/g-alumina catalyst and pure CeO2, as it is
almost the arithmetic mean of these two components at each
stage. This interpretation is conﬁrmed by the XRD results
which show that the diffraction patterns of this catalyst before
as well as after reaction with or without CO2 are simply the
summation of the structural properties of the two partners.
Thus, these results clearly indicate that there is no formation of
hybrid phases like CeAlO3, for instance, during the reaction.
The XRD pattern of the Pd/CeO2 catalyst does not vary either
after reaction but variations in the surface area values of this
catalyst are observed after test with or without CO2 in the feed
(34 and 49 m2 g1 versus 25 m2 g1, respectively). Obviously,
the BET surface area of the Ce2(CO3)3 material strongly
increases after test with and without CO2 (41 and 36 m2 g1
versus 5.4 m2 g1, respectively). There are also important
structural modiﬁcations of the material, including the devel-
opment of the (1 1 1) peak of the CeO2 phase, whose FWHM is
wider than that of the home-made CeO2 (0.698 and 0.638 versus
0.448).
XPS results obtained after reaction, both with and without
CO2 in the feed, on various ceria-containing materials are
presented in Table 3. The surface C-content on the surface of
each sample is not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the presence of

CO2. Two kinds of O1s species could be identiﬁed (Low BE
O1s and High BE O1s). The former would be indicative of O
atoms bound to Ce atoms [23], whereas the latter would be
dedicated to O atoms linked to other elements like C or Zr
[19,20]. The ratio of Low BE O1s species to the overall amount
of O1s species (Low BE O1s/O1s) is also the same with and
without CO2 for both the Pd/CeO2 (51.5% versus 47.7%) and
the CeO2 (72.8% versus 72.1%) samples. However, an increase
of this ratio can be observed in the case of the Ce2(CO3)3
material when the test was carried out in the presence of CO2 in
the CCM feed (71.8% versus 53.7%). The same trend is
observed but to a more pronounced extent for the Pd/
Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst (68.7% versus 43.0%).
Some commercial ceria-containing and one home-made
CeO2 compounds were analyzed by XPS in order to validate the
use of the proportion of Low BE O1s/O1s ratio as an indicator
of the overall oxidation state of ceria. Results are given in
Table 4. Obviously, the Low BE O1s proportion increases with
the oxidation degree of ceria. The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio is
very
low
on
Ce(III)
compounds
(8.5
and
15.8%
for
Ce2(CH3COO)3 and Ce2(CO3)3, respectively), and quite high
on Ce(IV) materials (66.2 and 66.8% for home-made and
commercial CeO2 compounds, respectively).
3.3. In situ DRIFTS experiments
The Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst was studied under CCM reaction
conditions (Fig. 2). Gaseous CH4 is observed at 1304 cm1
(spectrum B) and CO2 production is evidenced at 500 8C (D) by
the appearance of the wide signal located around 2300 cm1. In
the presence of CO2 in the feed, this peak is strongly reinforced
(E to G) and additional peaks are observed at 200 8C at 1650
and 1440 cm1. They account for carbonates and/or hydro-
genocarbonate species adsorbed on the alumina support [24–
30]. These peaks disappear at 300 8C and no other pattern is
observed at 500 8C, a temperature at which the catalyst is
active, as evidenced by the increase of the CO2g signal.
A peak very close to that of CO2g is observed on the Pd/
Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst (Fig. 3, spectrum A). Under CCM
reaction conditions, this peak enlarges when temperature
increases up to 500 8C, due to the appearance of a shoulder
accounting for CO2 production (B to D). The signal-to-noise
ratio of the spectra is affected by production of water at high
temperature (C and D). No other spectral features are observed.
The same pattern is observed in presence of CO2 in the feed (E
to G); no differences are observed when compared with the
spectra collected under standard CCM conditions.
The evolution of the DRIFTS pattern of the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2
catalyst under oxidizing or reducing conditions is displayed in
Fig. 4. Under reducing conditions (40 vol.% H2 in He at 350 8C),
the peak centered at 1425 cm1 strongly decreases (A to B).
After He ﬂush (C), this peak quickly (2 min) reappears under
oxidizing conditions (50 vol.% O2 in He at 300 8C) (D). After a
new reductionprocess (E), the peakat1425 cm1 also re-appears
under He at 300 8C (F), but after a much longer time period
(46 min).
Speciﬁcexperimentswerethenmade at300 8Cfocusedonthe
speed of the recovery of the full intensity of the peak at
1425 cm1 after a reducing treatment (40 vol.% H2 in He at
350 8C for 1 h). Tests were made under He, O2 and CO2 and
results are illustrated in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table 5. As
mentioned above, the peak reappears after 46 min under He (A to

4. Discussion
4.1. Inﬂuence of the support
As can be seen, both in Fig. 1 and in Table 1, the addition of
some CO2 in the feed has an inhibiting effect on the activity of
the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst for the CCM reaction, as previously
reported in the literature [7,11,13,18]. On the contrary, the
presence of some CO2 in the gaseous feed does not
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the activity of both the Pd/CeO2
catalyst and the (Pd/g-Al2O3 + CeO2) mixture, whilst an
activating
effect
is
observed
in
the
case
of
the
Pd/
Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst. This result conﬁrms the dependence
on the support of the effective inﬂuence of CO2 in the
catalytic combustion of methane, as reported earlier [18,19].
However, it is worth noting that the activating effect of CO2
observed on ceria-zirconia based catalysts disappears when
ceria is used as the sole supporting material of the palladium
active phase. Thus, it seems that zirconia is necessary in order
to (i) increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium
catalysts in conventional operating conditions and (ii) allow
the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some
CO2 in the feed.
The ﬁrst observation might be partly related to the intrinsic
activity of the ceria-zirconia material for the CCM reaction in
the 400–800 8C temperature range [31,32]. Nonetheless, both
observations are certainly related to the well-known oxygen
storage capacity (OSC) of ceria [33–37], associated to its
ability to easily change oxidation states from Ce4+ to Ce3+ and
back [33,35,38,39], which is improved by the presence of Zr
[32,39–45]. Indeed, the introduction of the smaller Zr4+ cation
into the ﬂuorite lattice of CeO2 strongly enhances the
efﬁciency of the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple [45]. This generates
defects throughout the crystal, which in turn, brings to an
increase of the oxygen mobility and diffusion in the lattice.
Actually, the solid solutions resulting from their mixing
crystallize as cubic or tetragonal phases as a function of the
composition [33,46]: solid solutions crystallize in a cubic
system up to Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 composition [33]. According to
Ferna
´ndez-Garcı
´a et al. [44], the use of zirconium in ceria-
based
materials
allows
the
stabilization
of
tetragonal
structures displaying improved oxygen-handling properties
with respect to the ﬂuorite-type, cubic polymorph of ceria.
From this point of view, the lower surface area of Pd/
Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst than that of the Pd/CeO2 catalyst
(8 m2 g1 versus 25 m2 g1, respectively) is not a handicap,
since the OSC of ceria directly depends on its surface area, but
not that of ceria-zirconia [32,33].

4.2. Activation and dissociation of CO2
4.2.1. Role of zirconia
The PdO/CeO2 catalyst is known to be able to ignite
combustion at moderate temperatures [47], and our results
conﬁrm this statement. However, better results were obtained
with the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst and, what is more, an
activating effect of CO2 could be obtained with this catalyst.
We suggest that the activity improvement of Pd/Ce-Zr-O in
presence of CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of the
ceria-zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 in order to
maintain ceria in a highly oxidized state. Then, migration of
some O species coming from the ceria-zirconia material
towards the active catalytic phase would enhance the oxidation
state of the palladium, improving catalytic activity. Indeed, on
the one hand, it is well known that CeO2 promotes oxidation of
Pd to PdO [32,41,48–50]. The presence of ceria modiﬁes the Pd
chemistry under oxidizing conditions, maintaining palladium
in its oxidized state [41,48–50]. This is due to the very high
redox potential of the Ce4+/Ce3+ couple (1.61 eV), which is
higher than that of Pd2+/Pd0 [32]. On the other hand, it has
recently been shown that, under reaction conditions, palladium
works in a highly oxidized state with its surface covered with
active O species [51]. The explanation of CO2 dissociation on
ceria-zirconia material and migration of resulting O species
towards the palladium phase is coherent with this picture. This
migration would maintain the palladium phase in an oxidized
state, which is beneﬁcial for the methane combustion process,
as suggested also by other researchers [45].
4.2.2. Role of palladium and ceria
As discussed in the previous sections, the absence of
zirconia would prevent the catalyst from taking advantage of
the presence of CO2 in the stream. Moreover, the addition of
CO2 to the CCM feed on CeO2 alone induces an impressive
decrease of the intrinsic activity of this kind of material. Thus,
without the simultaneous presence of both supported palladium
and ceria, no activation of CO2 seems to be possible. Bernal
et al. [52] also suggested a Pt-assisted CO2 reoxidation of the
ceria support of a Pt/CeO2 pre-reduced catalyst at temperatures
as low as 200 8C. This is in line with results reported by
Holmgren et al. [37], which evidence that three terms actually
contribute to total OSC: the OSC of ceria itself, the OSC of Pt
and the OSC originating from the Pt-ceria contact.
However, our results show that no intimate contact between
the ceria support and the palladium active phase seems
necessary. Indeed, the simple physical contact with CeO2
allows a signiﬁcant increase in the catalytic activity of the Pd/
alumina catalyst, as observed for the (Pd/g-Al2O3 + CeO2)
mixture (T50 = 395 8C versus 410 8C). This result is in favor of
cooperation between phases (ceria and palladium) and is in line
with the above-mentioned hypothesis concerning the potential
migration of some O species coming from the ceria material.
Indeed, given that the intrinsic activity of the ceria compound
can be considered marginal, the apparent activity of the
mechanical mixture reﬂects a real cooperation between phases
(synergetic effect), and would result from the fact that some O
species could migrate from ceria towards palladium to keep it in
a highly oxidized state. This hypothesis is supported by the fact
that similar results were observed with mixtures of NiMoO4
and CeO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, as
discussed elsewhere [19]. Moreover, the addition of CeO2
allows the Pd/alumina catalyst to maintain its good activity
even under CO2-rich conditions, which is not the case when the
Pd/alumina catalyst is used alone. CeO2 would be responsible
for the disappearance of the inhibiting effect of CO2 thanks to
the formation and migration of O species which could come
from CO2.
Thus, it is obvious that ceria plays the main role in the
activating process of CO2, which is believed to be due to its
OSC character. Indeed, CO2 dissociation on ceria-based
materials has already been reported in the literature but only
above 700 8C [53–56]. The activation of CO2 in order to
produce active O species is enabled by the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox
couple of ceria [56]. More precisely, Wang et al. [54] suggest
that the Ce3+ sites formed during reaction would be responsible
for the activation of CO2. Indeed, reduced CeO2x moieties
have the powerful ability to abstract oxygen from simple
oxygen-containing molecules such as CO2 [36]. This was
conﬁrmed by CO2 isotope exchange experiments which
showed that this molecule exchanges oxygen with Pt/ceria
and ceria quite easily at 400 8C [37].
4.2.3. Results interpretation
Our XPS results are in line with the hypothesis emitted by
Wang et al. [54] concerning the active sites for CO2 activation.
Indeed, enrichment in Low BE O1s species was observed after
test in presence of CO2, on both Ce2(CO3)3 and Pd/
Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 but not on the CeO2 material or on the Pd/
CeO2 catalyst. It is obvious that the ﬁrst sample (initially)
contains Ce(III) atoms, whereas the last two are made of Ce(IV)
atoms; the case of the ceria-zirconia supported catalyst will be
discussed later. In view of the above-mentioned hypothesis, the
increase in Low BE O1s species in the Ce2(CO3)3 material can
now be interpreted in terms of a capacity of such material to
activate and dissociate CO2 to oxidize the ceria material much
better than without CO2 in the feed (71.8% versus 53.7%,
respectively). The value, very close to that of pure CeO2, with or
without CO2 (71.8 versus 72.8 and 72.1, respectively) suggests
that under these conditions, ceria was completely oxidized to
CeO2. In line with this, no difference was observed for this last
material in the presence of CO2, since no Ce(III) atoms were
initially present in the material. The same comment can be made
for the CeO2-supported catalyst; however, the presence of
palladium probably induces some interaction between both
phases, which might create some O vacancies in the ceria lattice.
These vacancies could be used to activate some CO2 molecules,
which could explain the (very) slight increase of Low BE O1s
species in presence of CO2. A strong increase of this ratio was
observed for the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst. This could be
explained by the interaction between ceria and zirconia, which
would induce O defects in the ceria framework. The sharing of O
atoms with the Zr atoms probably weakens the oxygen
environment of ceria, due to the higher electronegativity of
O. Demoulin et al. / Applied Catalysis B: Environmental 70 (2007) 284–293
290
zirconia (1.4 versus 1.1) lowering the overall oxidation state of
ceria, which leads to a decrease of the Low BE O1s/O1s ratio.
This is evidenced by the higher value of the Low BE O1s species
of these samples, when compared with that of the Pd/CeO2
catalyst, both with and without CO2 in the feed (529.7 and
529.7 eV versus 529.2 and 529.3 eV, respectively). Such an
increase of BE when the Ce content decreased was also observed
by Damyanova et al. on ceria-alumina materials and was
attributed to a change in the coordination number of Ce due to an
interaction between both components, forming Ce-O-Al bonds
[23]. These O vacancies could then act as activating centers for
CO2 dissociation. Moreover, the presence of palladium probably
enhances such structure defects, as discussed above in the case of
the PdO/CeO2 catalyst. As a consequence, an activating effect of
the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/
Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers are present (as
for Ce2(CO3)3) and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase
cooperation (as for Pd/CeO2), which are both necessary for CO2
activation.
This is in accordance with the increase in the Low BE O1s
species observed in Pd/CexZr1xO2 catalysts, after working
under CO2, as reported elsewhere [19,20]. These Low BE O1s
species are characteristic of oxygen bound to cerium atoms,
suggesting once again that the Ce atoms are responsible for the
activation of CO2.
4.3. Oxidizing power of CO2
The oxidizing power of CO2 at low or mild temperature has
already been reported in the literature [16,17,52,57,58]. As
mentioned above, Bernal et al. [52] reported that the support of
a pre-reduced Pt/CeO2 catalyst was partly reoxidized after
exposure to CO2 (300 Torr) at 200 8C.
Dury et al. observed higher conversion rates and lower
selectivity values when some CO2 was added in the feed during
the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) on NiMoO4
and ona mixture of NiMoO4 + a-Sb2O4 between 400 and480 8C
[16,17]. They attributed this catalytic behavior to the formation
of highly active O species coming from the dissociation of CO2
during the reaction [16,17]. They provided XPS clues for this
hypothesis but no direct spectroscopic evidence. Nonetheless,
spectral evidences of the oxidizing power of CO2 at low
temperature can be found elsewhere in the literature [57,58].
In the methanol synthesis reaction, Saussey and Lavalley
[57] observed a shift towards higher wavenumber values of the
n(CO) of CO species coordinated on copper when increasing
amounts of CO2 were introduced at 250 8C. They suggested
that this shift could be related to an increase in the oxidation
state of the copper sites due to CO2. In their IR study of the
surface passivation of a Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst, Wu et al. [58]
observed the appearance of a small CO band following CO2
adsorption between RT and 200 8C. They suggested that a
fraction of CO2 might undergo dissociation on the active sites
of Mo2C, giving CO and O atoms, even at RT. However,
Solymosi et al. found that the decomposition of CO2 to CO and
O atoms on Mo2C prepared on Mo(1 0 0) surface only occurred
above 550 8C [59].
Inthis work,wecould observe a direct spectroscopic evidence
of the oxidizing power of CO2 at mild (300 8C) temperature on
a Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst. By following the evolution of the
peak located at 1425 cm1 under various redox atmospheres, it
was possible to observe a faster recovery of full intensity of this
peak after a reducing treatment under a CO2 atmosphere than
under He. This peak belongs to the carbonates/bicarbonates
region (1700–1200 cm1) [43], and may tentatively be assigned
to unidentate carbonates [44]. Nonetheless, the fact that the
intensity of this peak is strongly inﬂuenced by the redox
atmosphere inside the cell points to a bond or vibration mode of
the oxidized ceria rather than to carbonates species.
The faster recovery under CO2 would result from the use of
surrounding CO2 by the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize
itself. This implies that the CO2 dissociation must occur to
allow some O atoms to be consumed by the Ce-Zr-O material.
This oxygen supply enables the surface of the material to
reoxidize faster than by O migration from the bulk, which is
supposed to explain the recovery of the full intensity under He.
Indeed, in the 300–500 8C temperature range, the surface
reduction process is faster than the O diffusion from the bulk to
the surface [60]. However, the oxidizing power of CO2 is very
slight when compared with the results obtained under O2.
Actually, this set of experiments illustrated the dynamic OSC,
which is measured using transient dynamic experiments while
total OSC is measured by pulse or TPR/TPO studies [43].
4.4. The carbonates formation hypothesis
Ce2(CO3)3 material was tested for the reaction of catalytic
combustion of methane to check the inﬂuence of the potential
formation of carbonate species on the ceria surface. It clearly
appears that Ce2(CO3)3 is almost inactive for the catalytic
combustion of methane. Moreover, the addition of some CO2 in
the reactants mixture further inhibits the very weak activity of
this kind of material. Actually, Ce2(CO3)3 transforms into CeO2
during the reaction, as conﬁrmed by the characterization results
(see Tables 2 and 4).
Indeed, the very low surface area of the Ce2(CO3)3 is
dramatically increased after reaction, either in presence or in
absence of CO2 in the feed. This is due to the transformation of
this material into pure CeO2 (cerianite) under the reaction
conditions, as evidenced by XRD, which shows that the (1 1 1)
peak of CeO2 appears on these catalysts after test. This
transformation occurs both with and without CO2 in the reactants
mixture. It is worth noting that the CeO2 thus obtained has a
relatively higher surface area than the synthesized CeO2,
obtained by the citrates method (Table 2). This observation is
conﬁrmed by XRD analysis, which shows that the (1 1 1) peak of
CeO2 obtained this way is wider than that of CeO2 synthesizedby
the citrates method. This reveals a less crystalline structure,
which is in agreement with a higher surface area (Table 2).
Furthermore, XPS results also clearly indicate that the
Ce2(CO3)3 transforms into CeO2 under reaction conditions.
Indeed, the Low BE O1s/O1s ratio becomes almost equal to that
observed on pure CeO2 after the test, in particular for the
sample tested in presence of CO2, for the reasons discussed
O. Demoulin et al. / Applied Catalysis B: Environmental 70 (2007) 284–293
291
above. When compared with the original values (see Table 4),
the increase of this index is tremendous (Low BE O1s/
O1s = 71.8 versus 15.8). It is worth noting that values obtained
on both the commercial and the home-made CeO2 materials are
very close to each other (66.8 and 66.2%, respectively). This
conﬁrms that the Low BE O1s/O1s ratio can be used as a
relevant indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria and that
fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) gives a ratio of about 70%. On the
contrary, compounds mainly based on Ce(III) are characterized
by a much lower ratio (15% or less).
DRIFTS results also indicate that carbonate species are not
stable under reaction conditions above 300 8C, i.e., above the
light-off temperature, ruling out the hypothesis of a carbonates-
related CO2 inhibition of the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst. Nonetheless,
these results also show that the presence of CO2 in the feed
induces indeed the formation of carbonates and/or hydro-
genocarbonates below 300 8C, which adsorb on the surface of
the alumina-supported catalyst. The point is that such
phenomenon is not observed in the case of the ceria-zirconia
supported catalyst. This observation does not explain the
effective inﬂuence of CO2 upon the CCM reaction, but is again
in favor of the hypothesis of the ability of ceria-zirconia
material to take advantage of the presence of CO2 in the feed
and to use it in a beneﬁcial way, preventing carbonates
formation and accumulation on the surface of the catalyst.
Wang et al. [54] also came to the conclusion that the ceria
component plays a role in the activation of the chemisorbed
CO2 to prevent the formation of bulk carbonate.
Finally, XPS results show that the overall C content on all
samples after reaction is not affected by the presence of CO2 in
the feed. This strongly suggests that some inﬂuence of presence
of coke at the surface of the catalyst can be ruled out in
explaining the role of CO2 in the reaction.
Thus, it seems that the hypothesis of carbonates formation
does not explain the inﬂuence of CO2 upon the CCM reaction
process, since (i) Ce2(CO3)3 transforms into CeO2 under reaction
conditions and (ii) CO2-induced carbonates are removed from
the surface of the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst below 300 8C under
reaction conditions; a temperature at which the catalyst is not yet
active. These results could help in understanding the debated
inﬂuence of CO2 upon the CCM reaction [7].
5. Conclusions
(1) The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during
catalytic combustion of methane and that its inﬂuence
actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst: the
alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2,
but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as
supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can
promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures.
(2) The hypothesis of carbonates formation to explain the
inﬂuence of CO2 upon the CCM reaction process is not
relevant, since carbonates species, which are only observed
on the alumina-supported catalyst, are not stable under
reaction conditions above 300 8C. Such species were never
observed in the case of the ceria-zirconia supported catalyst.
(3) The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O in presence of
CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of ceria-
zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 to CO and active
oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase
in order to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state,
improving activity.
(4) Ceria plays the main role in the activating process of CO2,
due to its oxygen storage capacity character: the Ce3+ sites
would be responsible for the activation of CO2. However,
zirconia is necessary (i) to increase the activity of ceria-
supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating
conditions, and (ii) to allow the ceria material to take
advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed, allowing
its activation. This would be related to the OSC of ceria.
(5) Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is also
necessary for CO2 activation. Thus, an activating effect of
the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/
Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers (Ce3+) are
present, and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase
cooperation.
(6) DRIFTS experiments evidenced that, after a reducing
treatment, the full intensity of a peak of the Pd/
Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst (at 1425 cm1) was recovered faster
under a CO2 atmosphere than under He (O migration from
the bulk). This would result from the use of surrounding
CO2, via its dissociation, by the ceria-zirconia material to
reoxidize itself. However, the recovery of full intensity of
the peak (reoxidation) was much faster under O2 than under
CO2 at 300 8C.
(7) The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio can be used as a relevant
indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria: fully
oxidized ceria (CeO2) gives a ratio of about 70%, whereas
compounds mainly based on Ce(III) are characterized by a
much lower ratio (15% or less).
