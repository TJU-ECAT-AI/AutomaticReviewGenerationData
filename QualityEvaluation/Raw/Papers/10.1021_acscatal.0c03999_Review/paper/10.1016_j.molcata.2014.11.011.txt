The  effect
 of  carbon

 and  hydrogen
 pre-reduction
 on  the performance
 of  10FeAl
 catalyst
 in
propane
 dehydrogenation
 was studied.
 The  optimal  results,
 20  wt%  propylene
 yield  at
 an  overall
 propane
conversion
 of 24 wt% was  obtained
 over  the  sample  pre-reduced
 by  hydrogen
 at  600 ◦C  for  10  h  at  560 ◦C.
Based
 on  XRD,
 XPS  and  IR  results,  it  is  proposed
 that  the  carbon  and  FexC  species
 formed
 from  propylene
cracking
 under  the  activation
 of
 surface  adsorbed
 oxygen
 species
 are  the  active  sites  for  the  formation
 of
abundant
 methane
 over  untreated  10FeAl  catalyst.
 Pre-reduction
 treatment
 leads
 to  the  consumption
 of
surface
 adsorbed
 oxygen
 species
 and the  formation
 of  Fe  and  Fe2+ species,
 which
 are  active
 for
 propane
dehydrogenation.
 For  one  thing,
 propane
 hydrogenolysis
 is
 strongly
 inhibited
 due
 to the  large  size  (around
30
 nm)  of Fe  grains.  For  another,
 propylene
 cracking
 and  the  generation
 of  carbon
 and  FexC  species  are
largely
 suppressed
 in
 the  absence
 of  surface  electronegative
 oxygen
 species,
 hence  inhibiting
 propane
cracking
 and  hydrogenolysis
 reactions,
 resulting
 in  greatly
 improved
 dehydrogenation
 performance.

 Introduction
Catalytic
 systems
 based
 on
 supported
 or
 unsupported
 iron
 are
a
 kind
 of
 active
 catalysts
 in
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
to
 propylene
 [1–7].
 Among
 the
 studied
 catalysts,
 iron-containing
zeolites
 with
 low
 iron
 loadings
 have
 been
 extensively
 reported
[2,3,6,7].
 Due
 to
 the
 stronger
 acidity
 of
 zeolites
 which
 favored
 cok-
ing
 and
 cracking
 reactions,
 the
 selectivity
 was
 rather
 low.
 In
 order
to
 further
 optimize
 the
 reaction
 results,
 many
 researchers
 have
paid
 their
 attention
 to
 the
 use
 of
 supports
 with
 weak
 acidity,
 e.g.:
Al2O3 or
 zeolites
 with
 high
 Si/Al
 [8].
 Nevertheless,
 the
 selectivity
was
 always
 improved
 at
 the
 expense
 of
 activity.
In
 comparison,
 catalytic
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 provides
an
 efﬁcient
 way
 to
 convert
 propane
 to
 propylene
 with
 high
 selec-
tivity.
 To
 date,
 most
 studies
 were
 focused
 on
 commercial
 Cr-based
[9–11]
 and
 Pt-based
 [12–14]
 catalysts.
 Far
 few
 researchers
 are
concerned
 with
 the
 performance
 of
 iron-based
 catalysts
 in
 this
reaction,
 let
 alone
 the
 nature
 of
 active
 sites
 for
 propane
 dehydro-
genation.
 In
 one
 paper
 [15],
 we
 reported
 that
 the
 introduction
 of
sulfate
 species
 signiﬁcantly
 improved
 propylene
 yield
 and
 selectiv-
ity
 over
 Fe2O3/-Al2O3 catalyst
 via
 the
 strong
 interaction
 with
 Fe
atoms
 in
 the
 form
 of
 Fe
 O
 S,
 which
 led
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 Fe
 sites

at
 electron-deﬁcient
 state
 and
 thus
 higher
 adsorption
 capacity
 of
propane.
 However,
 no
 detailed
 experiment
 on
 the
 role
 of
 Fe
 species
at
 different
 valence
 was
 conducted.
Typically,
 oxidized
 Fe2O3/-Al2O3 catalyst
 mainly
 contains
 Fe
in
 the
 form
 of
 well-dispersed
 Fe3+ or
 -Fe2O3 (at
 high
 loadings).
Under
 appropriate
 reducing
 atmosphere,
 Fe2O3 can
 be
 reduced
 in
the
 following
 steps
 [16]:
Fe2O3 →
 Fe3O4 →
 FeO
 →
 Fe
Depending
 on
 the
 reducing
 conditions,
 different
 intermediate
iron
 species
 are
 formed,
 which
 provides
 a
 theoretical
 basis
 for
 the
identiﬁcation
 of
 the
 role
 of
 Fe
 species
 at
 different
 valence
 in
 propane
dehydrogenation.
In
 this
 paper,
 the
 performance
 of
 Fe2O3/-Al2O3 catalysts
reduced
 under
 different
 reducing
 agent,
 temperature
 and
 time
in
 catalytic
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 was
 studied
 ﬁrst.
 Subse-
quently,
 the
 effects
 of
 reduction
 on
 the
 existing
 state
 of
 iron
 were
discussed.
 Based
 on
 these
 results,
 the
 nature
 of
 active
 iron
 species
in
 propane
 conversion
 was
 revealed.

 The
 catalyst
 (about
 30
 mg)
 was
 placed
 in
 a

 The
 temperature
 was
 raised
 from
20 ◦C
 to
 600 ◦C
 at
 a
 rate
 of
 10 ◦C/min
 under

 Samples
 were
 pressed
 into
 wafers
 and
 heated
up
 to

30
 mL/min.
 After
 reduction
 at

and
 purged
 in
 Ar
 for
 0.5

 Results
 and
 discussion
3.1.
 Effect
 of
 reducing
 agent
The
 activity
 of
 all
 catalysts
 was
 measured
 at
 a
 WHSV
 of
 0.54
 h−1
and
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 1.
 It
 is
 worth
 noting
 that
 for
 10FeAl,
 propylene
 was
the
 main
 product
 in
 the
 ﬁrst
 0.75
 h.
 Subsequently,
 propane
 conver-
sion
 and
 methane
 yield
 increased
 dramatically
 with
 TOS.
 After
 2
 h,
most
 of
 propane
 was
 converted
 to
 methane
 and
 hydrogen
 without
the
 formation
 of
 propylene.
 Besides,
 a
 certain
 amount
 of
 oxida-
tion
 products
 H2O
 and
 CO2 was
 observed
 (Fig.
 S1),
 suggesting
 that
propane
 can
 be
 oxidized
 by
 Fe2O3 [17].
 With
 extended
 reaction
time,
 the
 oxygen
 species
 were
 fast
 consumed
 as
 evidenced
 by
 the
dramatically
 decreased
 amount
 of
 H2O
 and
 CO2 in
 the
 product
 (Fig.
S1).
After
 pre-reduction,
 the
 catalysts
 exhibited
 a
 completely
 differ-
ent
 catalytic
 behavior.
 Propylene
 became
 the
 main
 product
 with
 the
formation
 of
 little
 amount
 of
 CH4,
 especially
 over
 sample
 F,
 much
higher
 propylene
 yield
 (about
 20
 wt%)
 was
 obtained.
 In
 spite
 of
the
 lower
 activity
 after
 pre-reducing
 by
 carbon
 monoxide,
 propane
dehydrogenation
 still
 predominated
 with
 propylene
 selectivity
maintained
 above
 70%.
 Among
 studies
 on
 propane
 dehydrogena-
tion
 published
 up
 to
 now,
 the
 effect
 of
 pre-reduction
 has
 not
 yet
been
 uniquely
 deﬁned.
 Gorriz
 et
 al.
 [18]
 suggested
 that
 CO
 pre-
reduction
 increased
 the
 initial
 cracking
 reaction
 and
 coke
 formation
in
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 over
 Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.
 Similar
results
 were
 obtained
 in
 isobutane
 dehydrogenation,
 besides,
 it
 was
found
 that
 hydrogen
 pre-reduction
 decreased
 the
 dehydrogenation
activity
 which
 was
 ascribed
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 OH/H
 groups
 [19].
In
 this
 regard,
 the
 present
 results
 are
 not
 in
 good
 agreement.
Fig.
 2
 showed
 XRD
 patterns
 of
 all
 samples.
 After
 pre-reduction,
no
 characteristic
 peak
 corresponding
 to
 Fe2O3 was
 retained,
 only
slight
 lines
 of
 Fe3O4 were
 observed
 after
 CO
 pre-reduction.
 While
after
 hydrogen
 pre-reduction,
 an
 obvious
 peak
 of
 Fe
 centered
 at
 2
44.7◦was
 detected.
 Based
 on
 these
 results,
 it
 is
 supposed
 that
 the
different
 catalytic
 performance
 is
 due
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 different
Fe
 species.
3.2.
 Effect
 of
 pre-reduction
 conditions
As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 S2,
 the
 H2-TPR
 proﬁle
 of
 10FeAl
 catalyst
 exhib-
ited
 mainly
 two
 reduction
 peaks
 with
 maxima
 at
 about
 450 ◦C
 and
600–650 ◦C,
 which
 can
 be
 ascribed
 to
 the
 reduction
 from
 Fe2O3 to
Fe3O4 and
 Fe3O4 to
 Fe
 [8,16,20].
 In
 order
 to
 further
 study
 the
 effect
of
 different
 Fe
 species
 on
 the
 catalytic
 performance,
 several
 kinds
of
 pre-reduction
 treatment
 by
 hydrogen
 with
 different
 reduction
temperature
 (450 ◦C
 and
 600 ◦C)
 and
 time
 (3
 h,
 10
 h)
 were
 adopted
and
 the
 results
 were
 displayed
 in
 Fig.

Similarly,
 all
 samples
 showed
 a
 signiﬁcant
 improvement
 in
 both
activity
 and
 selectivity.
 Increasing
 the
 reduction
 temperature
 from
450 ◦C
 to
 600 ◦C,
 an
 excellent
 dehydrogenation
 performance
 was
obtained,
 achieving
 more
 than
 80%
 selectivity
 at
 an
 overall
 propane
conversion
 of
 24
 wt%
 over
 sample
 F.
 Under
 the
 same
 reduction
temperature,
 both
 propylene
 yield
 and
 selectivity
 increased
 with
prolonged
 reduction
 time,
 which
 was
 more
 pronounced
 at
 600 ◦C.
Combining
 with
 the
 results
 in
 Section
 3.1,
 we
 deduce
 that
 the
stronger
 the
 reducibility
 of
 the
 reducing
 agent,
 the
 higher
 reduction
temperature
 and
 the
 longer
 reduction
 time,
 the
 higher
 dehydro-
genation
 activity
 and
 selectivity.
 Furthermore,
 the
 reaction
 was
performed
 over
 catalyst
 F
 at
 different
 space
 velocity
 by
 changing
the
 ﬂow
 rate
 of
 propane
 (Fig.
 S3).
 Both
 propane
 conversion
 and
propylene
 yield
 increased
 with
 decreasing
 space
 velocity.
 In
 the
meantime,
 side
 reactions
 such
 as
 cracking
 reaction
 were
 facili-
tated,
 resulting
 in
 increased
 methane
 yield
 and
 lower
 propylene
selectivity
 
at
 
longer
 
contact
 
time.
 
Nevertheless,
 
propyl-
ene
 
was
 
always
 
the

product,

It
 is
 worth
 noting
 that
 no
 “induction
 period”
 of
 activity
 was
observed
 for
 sample
 F.
 In
 the
 initial
 stage,
 the
 catalyst
 showed
the
 best
 performance
 with
 about
 20
 wt%
 propylene
 yield
 and
 84%
selectivity,
 indicating
 that
 Fe
 species
 at
 low
 state
 are
 more
 beneﬁ-
cial
 to
 the
 production
 of
 propylene.
 As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 2,
 Fe2O3 was
reduced
 to
 Fe3O4 and
 Fe
 after
 reduction
 at
 450 ◦C
 and
 600 ◦C
 respec-
tively,
 and
 the
 longer
 the
 reduction
 time,
 the
 stronger
 the
 intensity
of
 diffraction
 lines
 of
 Fe.
 Considering
 the
 increased
 activity
 with
raised
 reduction
 temperature
 and
 time,
 it
 seems
 to
 suggest
 the
 for-
mation
 of
 Fe
 is
 in
 favor
 of
 dehydrogenation
 reaction.
 For
 detailed
elaboration,
 we
 will
 discuss
 in
 the
 following
 sections.
3.3.
 The
 reaction
 route
 of
 propane
 over
 Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalyst
We
 have
 demonstrated
 that
 pre-reduced
 10FeAl
 catalysts
 are
more
 selective
 in
 propane
 dehydrogenation.
 Under
 the
 same
 reac-
tion
 conditions,
 most
 of
 propane
 was
 converted
 to
 methane
 over
10FeAl
 after
 reaction
 for
 1
 h.
 Pre-reduction
 of
 the
 catalyst
 signif-
icantly
 changed
 the
 course
 of
 reaction,
 turning
 dehydrogenation
reaction
 into
 the
 predominant
 reaction.
 To
 study
 the
 origin
 of
 this
phenomenon,
 it
 is
 essential
 to
 explore
 the
 reaction
 route
 of
 propane
over
 10FeAl
 ﬁrstly.
Alka
 and
 Lunsford
 [21,22]
 had
 studied
 the
 reactions
 between
simple
 alkanes
 (alkenes)
 and
 oxygen
 species,
 putting
 forward
 that
in
 addition
 to
 activating
 alkane
 dehydrogenation
 to
 corresponding
alkenes,
 O−is
 also
 active
 in
 cracking
 reaction,
 e.g.:
 at
 tempera-
tures
 above
 450 ◦C,
 mainly
 methane
 was
 obtained
 by
 the
 reaction
between
 propylene
 and
 O−.
 According
 to
 the
 reaction
 results
 over
10FeAl
 catalyst,
 we
 may
 envisage
 that
 one
 possible
 source
 of
methane
 is
 propylene
 cracking.
 To
 validate
 the
 above
 speculation,
the
 O
 1s
 spectrum
 of
 sample
 A*
 (10FeAl
 reacted
 for
 2
 h)
 was
 char-
acterized
 and
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 4.
 Only
 one
 peak
 centered
 at
 about
531–532
 eV
 was
 observed,
 indicating
 the
 presence
 of
 electrophilic
oxygen
 species
 such
 as
 O−,
 O22−.
 However,
 if
 all
 of
 methane
 is
 from
propylene
 cracking,
 one
 would
 expect
 approximately
 equal
 mole
(that
 is,
 the
 ratio
 of
 the
 mass
 yield
 is
 8:1)
 of
 methane
 and
 hydrogen
in
 the
 product
 according
 to
 the
 reaction:
C3H6 →
 CH4 +
 H2 +
 2C
 
(1)
But
 less
 methane
 was
 obtained
 (Fig.
 1).
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 after
1
 h,
 propane
 conversion
 and
 methane
 yield
 began
 to
 increase
 dra-
matically
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 suggesting
 that
 propane
 also
 makes
great
 contribution
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 methane.
 According
 to
literatures
 [23–26],
 it
 is
 probably
 through
 propane
 hydrogenolysis

reaction
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 generated
 hydrogen,
 and
 two
 parallel
reactions
 were
 supposed
 to
 occur:
C3H8 +
 H2 →
 C2H6 +
 CH4
(2)
C3H8 +
 2H2 →
 3CH4
(3)
Since
 ethane
 is
 much
 less
 active
 than
 propane,
 its
 further
 con-
version
 to
 methane
 can
 be
 negligible
 [25,26].
 Hence,
 it
 is
 concluded
that
 the
 hydrogenolysis
 of
 propane
 to
 methane
 takes
 place
 through
reaction
 (3).
 To
 verify
 the
 speculation,
 the
 reaction
 was
 performed
over
 10FeAl
 under
 1:1
 molar
 ratio
 of
 H2/C3H8 (Fig.
 5).
 In
 the
 initial
stage,
 the
 catalyst
 exhibited
 a
 lower
 activity
 because
 of
 diluted
 con-
centration
 of
 propane
 with
 hydrogen,
 but
 propylene
 was
 still
 the
main
 product.
 After
 1
 h,
 methane
 yield
 began
 to
 increase
 dramati-
cally
 while
 that
 of
 propylene
 declined.
 At
 TOS
 =
 2
 h,
 32
 wt%
 methane
yield
 with
 96%
 selectivity
 were
 obtained.
 Despite
 the
 slightly
 lower
initial
 activity
 after
 the
 introduction
 of
 hydrogen,
 it
 is
 obvious
 that
the
 existence
 of
 hydrogen
 signiﬁcantly
 promotes
 the
 formation
 of
methane.
 Furthermore,
 the
 reaction
 was
 conducted
 over
 10FeAl
under
 various
 molar
 ratios
 of
 H2/C3H8 by
 changing
 the
 ﬂow
 rate
of
 hydrogen
 (Fig.
 S4).
 Similarly,
 propane
 mainly
 dehydrogenated
to
 propylene
 in
 the
 initial
 stage.
 After
 1
 h,
 methane
 yield
 went
 up
signiﬁcantly
 with
 increased
 propane
 conversion,
 and
 the
 higher
the
 hydrogen
 partial
 pressure,
 the
 higher
 the
 yield
 of
 methane,
demonstrating
 the
 promotion
 effect
 of
 hydrogen
 on
 the
 formation
of
 methane.
We
 should
 also
 note
 that
 in
 addition
 to
 methane,
 about
 3
 wt%
hydrogen
 yield
 was
 obtained.
 If
 only
 reaction
 (3)
 occurs,
 the
 yield
 of
hydrogen
 should
 decrease
 with
 the
 increase
 in
 propane
 conversion.
Nevertheless,
 an
 opposite
 tendency
 was
 observed,
 suggesting
 that
there
 is
 another
 reaction
 process
 contributing
 to
 the
 formation
 of
hydrogen,
 which
 is
 supposed
 to
 be
 catalytic
 cracking
 of
 propane:
C3H8 →
 2CH4 +
 C
 
(4)
Based
 on
 these
 results,
 a
 simple
 reaction
 scheme
 over
 10FeAl
catalyst
 is
 proposed
 as
 depicted
 in
 Scheme
 1.
 Propylene
 is
 ﬁrst
formed
 by
 dehydrogenation
 reaction
 followed
 by
 cracking
 to
methane
 under
 the
 activation
 of
 surface
 electrophilic
 oxygen
species
 such
 as
 O−. Then
 methane
 and
 hydrogen
 are
 formed
through
 catalytic
 cracking
 and
 hydrogenolysis
 of
 propane.

 The
 nature
 of
 active
 iron
 species
 for
 propane
 conversion
As
 mentioned
 above,
 propane
 cracking
 and
 hydrogenolysis
 reac-
tions
 contribute
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 methane
 over
 10FeAl
 catalyst.
XRD
 results
 showed
 that
 Fe2O3 was
 reduced
 to
 Fe3O4 or
 Fe
 after
reduction,
 leading
 to
 signiﬁcantly
 improved
 catalytic
 performance.
Based
 on
 these
 results,
 it
 is
 inferred
 that
 10FeAl
 catalyst
 with
 the
formation
 of
 different
 iron
 species
 exhibit
 completely
 different
 cat-
alytic
 behavior.
In
 order
 to
 obtain
 more
 information
 about
 the
 changes
 in
 Fe
phase
 during
 the
 pre-reduction,
 the
 infrared
 spectra
 of
 adsorbed
CO
 on
 10FeAl
 catalysts
 reduced
 by
 hydrogen
 under
 progressively
more
 severe
 conditions
 were
 characterized
 and
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 6.
After
 reduction
 at
 723
 K,
 three
 bands
 at
 2155,
 2085
 and
 2050
 cm−1
appeared.
 Increasing
 the
 reduction
 temperature
 to
 873
 K,
 the
band
 at
 2085
 cm−1 disappeared
 while
 that
 at
 2050
 cm−1 became
much
 stronger
 with
 the
 emergence
 of
 a
 small
 shoulder
 band
 at
2010
 cm−1.
 Upon
 extending
 the
 reduction
 time,
 especially
 the
 band
at
 2010
 cm−1 intensiﬁed
 considerably.
 Since
 the
 band
 at
 2155
 cm−1
was
 always
 present
 and
 hardly
 affected
 by
 the
 reduction
 condi-
tion,
 it
 was
 attributed
 to
 CO
 adsorbed
 on
 Fe2+ cations
 that
 strongly
interact
 with
 the
 support
 [27].
 By
 contrast,
 the
 relative
 intensity
 of
2010/2050
 cm−1 band
 increased
 with
 progressively
 severe
 reduc-
tion
 treatment.
 Combining
 with
 XRD
 results,
 these
 bands
 probably
pointed
 to
 CO
 adsorption
 on
 metallic
 Fe
 atoms.
 According
 to
 Shep-
pard
 [28]
 and
 Seip
 et
 al.
 [29],
 the
 band
 at
 2050
 cm−1 can
 be
 ascribed
to
 CO
 adsorbed
 on
 reduced
 Fe
 atoms
 interacting
 with
 oxygen
 atoms
while
 that
 at
 2010
 cm−1 to
 fully
 reduced,
 iron
 crystallites.
 Thus,
 it
is
 concluded
 even
 after
 more
 severe
 reduction
 treatment,
 the
 sur-
faces
 of
 iron
 crystallites
 are
 still
 not
 fully
 reduced.

ticates

 the
 speculation
 (Fig.
 S5).
 Only
 2
 wt%

 loss
 was
obtained,
 which
 is
 smaller
 than
 the
 theoretical
 value
 of
 3
 wt%
 if
Fe2O3 is
 fully
 reduced
 to
 Fe.
To
 further
 investigate
 the
 effect
 of
 different
 iron
 species
 on
 the
catalytic
 performance,
 XPS
 measurements
 were
 also
 conducted
(Fig.
 7).
 After
 pre-reduction
 at
 450 ◦C
 for
 10
 h,
 two
 Fe
 2p
 peaks
located
 at
 724.1
 and
 709.8
 eV
 assigned
 to
 Fe3O4 were
 observed
[30,31].
 After
 reduction
 at
 600 ◦C,
 a
 double
 peak
 centered
 at
 706.8
and
 720.0
 eV
 corresponding
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 Fe
 appeared.
Besides,
 a
 small
 amount
 of
 Fe2+ evidenced
 by
 the
 appearance
 of
Fe
 2p3/2 (B.E.
 =
 709.0
 eV)
 with
 the
 satellite
 peak
 at
 around
 715.0
 eV
and
 Fe
 2p1/2 (B.E.
 =
 722.7
 eV)
 still
 presented.
 Based
 on
 the
 above
results,
 it
 is
 supposed
 that
 the
 Fe
 species
 at
 low
 valence
 state
 are
more
 conductive
 to
 propane
 dehydrogenation.
However,
 we
 should
 recognize
 that
 under
 the
 reaction
 condi-
tions,
 Fe3O4 can
 be
 further
 reduced
 as
 evidenced
 by
 the
 reduction
peak
 centered
 in
 the
 range
 of
 530–700 ◦C
 in
 Fig.
 S2.
 Thus,
 it
 is
 not
reasonable
 to
 correlate
 the
 properties
 of
 fresh
 sample
 D
 with
 the
performance.
 To
 trace
 the
 phase
 changes
 during
 the
 reaction,
 XRD
pattern
 of
 reacted
 sample
 D
 which
 showed
 the
 highest
 activity
was
 ﬁrstly
 carried
 out.
 As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 2,
 the
 diffraction
 lines
of
 Fe3O4 disappeared
 without
 the
 detection
 of
 diffraction
 lines
corresponding
 to
 metallic
 iron
 species,
 indicating
 the
 absence
 of
crystalline
 Fe
 phases
 of
 particle
 size
 greater
 than
 4
 nm.

 as
 described
 in
 Section
 2.2
 and
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 S6.
 Com-
pared
 with
 fresh
 sample
 D,
 the
 band
 at
 2085
 cm−1 disappeared
 with
the
 appearance
 of
 a
 new
 band
 at
 2020
 cm−1,
 which
 was
 attributed
to
 CO
 adsorbed
 on
 fully
 reduced
 iron
 atoms
 [28,29].
 Besides,
 the
two
 bands
 at
 2155
 cm−1 and
 2050
 cm−1 became
 much
 weaker,
demonstrating
 that
 some
 Fe2+ cations
 are
 further
 reduced
 to
 Fe
species
 during
 the
 process
 of
 reaction.
 Thus,
 it
 is
 concluded
 that
the
 Fe2+ and
 Fe
 species
 are
 the
 active
 sites
 for
 propane
 dehydro-
genation.
Similarly,
 Fe2O3 can
 also
 be
 reduced
 during
 the
 process
 of
 reac-
tion
 over
 10FeAl,
 but
 methane
 was
 the
 main
 product
 without
 the
formation
 of
 propylene.
 To
 explore
 the
 origin
 of
 the
 completely
different
 catalytic
 behavior,
 the
 reaction
 was
 conducted
 over
 pre-
reduced
 Fe2O3 (Fig.
 8).
 In
 the
 ﬁrst
 3
 h,
 most
 propane
 was
 converted
to
 COx and
 propylene,
 then
 methane
 and
 hydrogen
 began
 to
increase
 dramatically.
 As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 2,
 Fe2O3 was
 also
 reduced
 to
Fe
 species
 after
 reduction,
 but
 behaved
 completely
 differently
 from
sample
 E
 and
 F.
 The
 XRD
 pattern
 of
 pre-reduced
 Fe2O3 reacted
 for
4
 h,
 which
 exhibited
 high
 cracking
 activity
 showed
 obvious
 diffrac-
tion
 lines
 of
 FexC,
 which
 is
 supposed
 to
 be
 responsible
 for
 propane
cracking
 and
 thus
 the
 generation
 of
 abundant
 methane
 [30].
 Com-
bining
 with
 the
 discussions
 in
 Section
 3.3,
 it
 is
 concluded
 that
 in
the
 presence
 of
 active
 surface
 oxygen
 species
 such
 as
 O−,
 propyl-
ene
 produced
 in
 the
 initial
 stage
 over
 10FeAl
 catalyst
 ﬁrstly
 takes
place
 cracking
 reaction,
 leading
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 carbon
 and
 FexC
species.
 On
 one
 hand,
 the
 generated
 carbon
 species
 combine
 with
surface
 oxygen
 species
 and
 give
 rise
 to
 unsaturated
 C
 O
 groups
such
 as
 carboxyl
 group,
 which
 are
 considered
 to
 be
 the
 active
 sites
for
 cracking
 and
 carbon
 deposition
 reactions
 [24].
 On
 the
 other
hand,
 the
 resulting
 FexC
 species
 facilitate
 propane
 hydrogenolysis
reaction,
 hence
 abundant
 methane
 is
 generated.
 In
 this
 regard,
 the
presence
 of
 surface
 oxygen
 species
 O−plays
 a
 key
 role
 in
 propane
conversion,
 which
 was
 validated
 by
 the
 reaction
 results
 over
 sam-
ple
 G.
 After
 re-oxidation
 of
 sample
 F
 at
 600 ◦C,
 a
 similar
 product
distribution
 with
 10FeAl
 (Fig.
 S7)
 was
 obtained,
 demonstrating
above
 speculations.
In
 comparison,
 pre-reduction
 treatment
 signiﬁcantly
 improves
the
 catalytic
 performance,
 leading
 to
 much
 higher
 yield
 and
 selec-
tivity
 of
 propylene.
 In
 the
 light
 of
 aforementioned
 results,
 this
phenomenon
 is
 attributed
 to
 the
 following
 reasons.
 For
 one
 thing,
the
 surface
 electronegative
 oxygen
 species
 are
 consumed
 after
pre-reduction,
 suppressing
 propylene
 cracking
 and
 thus
 the
 for-
mation
 of
 carbon
 and
 FexC
 species
 which
 are
 supposed
 to
 promote
propane
 cracking
 and
 hydrogenolysis
 reactions.
 For
 another,
 in
spite
 of
 the
 formation
 of
 Fe
 particles
 after
 reduction,
 the
 calcu-
lated
 average
 particle
 size
 of
 Fe
 from
 the
 XRD
 line
 broadening
using
 Scherrer
 equation
 of
 sample
 E
 and
 F
 are
 25
 nm
 and
 34
 nm
respectively,
 which
 is
 to
 the
 disadvantage
 of
 propane
 hydrogenol-
ysis
 [32,33].
On
 the
 basis
 of
 above
 results,
 a
 simple
 reaction
 mechanism
over
 untreated
 and
 pre-reduced
 10FeAl
 catalysts
 is
 proposed
 as
depicted
 in
 Fig.
 9.
 For
 10FeAl,
 propane
 is
 ﬁrst
 converted
 to
 pro-
pylene
 followed
 by
 cracking
 reaction
 under
 the
 activation
 of
adsorbed
 electronegative
 oxygen
 species,
 simultaneously,
 Fe2O3
is
 reduced
 accompanied
 by
 the
 formation
 of
 methane
 through
propane
 cracking
 reaction
 and
 hydrogenolysis
 reactions
 under
 the
activation
 of
 carbon
 and
 FexC
 species.
 In
 comparison,
 the
 pre-
reduction
 treatment
 consumes
 surface
 oxygen
 species
 and
 leads
 to
the
 formation
 of
 Fe2+ and
 larger
 Fe
 particles,
 inhibiting
 propylene
cracking
 and
 thus
 propane
 cracking
 and
 hydrogenolysis
 reactions.
In
 addition,
 it
 is
 speculated
 that
 propane
 is
 easy
 to
 adsorb
 on
 the
formed
 coordinately
 unsaturated
 iron
 sites
 (Fe2+ and
 Fe
 species)
 at
electron-deﬁcient
 state,
 where
 C
 H
 is
 activated
 and
 broken
 with
the
 formation
 of
 OH
 and
 Fe
 C
 in
 a
 manner
 similar
 to
 that
 proposed
for
 Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts
 [17],
 hence
 facilitating
 the
 formation
 of
propylene.

 Conclusions
The
 effect
 of
 pre-reduction
 on
 the
 performance
 of
 Fe2O3/Al2O3
catalysts
 in
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 is
 elucidated
 by
 treating
10FeAl
 with
 different
 reducing
 agent,
 reduction
 temperature
 and
time.
 Both
 pre-reduction
 by
 hydrogen
 and
 carbon
 monoxide
resulted
 in
 dramatically
 improved
 propylene
 yield
 and
 selectivity,
and
 better
 catalytic
 performance
 was
 obtained
 at
 higher
 reduction
temperature
 and
 with
 longer
 reduction
 time
 by
 hydrogen.
 The
 best
results
 with
 20
 wt%
 propylene
 yield
 at
 an
 overall
 propane
 conver-
sion
 of
 24
 wt%
 was
 achieved
 after
 pre-reduction
 by
 hydrogen
 at
600 ◦C
 for
 10
 h.
On
 the
 basis
 of
 reaction
 and
 characterization
 results,
 a
 simple
reaction
 mechanism
 for
 propane
 conversion
 was
 proposed.
 It
 is
concluded
 that
 methane
 is
 formed
 through
 propane
 hydrogenoly-
sis
 and
 cracking
 reactions
 in
 which
 surface
 electronegative
 oxygen
species
 play
 a
 key
 role.
 After
 pre-reduction,
 surface
 adsorbed
 oxy-
gen
 species
 are
 consumed
 with
 the
 formation
 of
 Fe
 crystallites
 and
Fe2+.
 On
 one
 hand,
 propane
 hydrogenolysis
 is
 strongly
 inhibited
due
 to
 the
 larger
 size
 of
 Fe
 grains
 (about
 30
 nm).
 On
 the
 other
hand,
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 adsorbed
 oxygen
 species
 such
 as
 O−,
 pro-
pylene
 cracking
 and
 the
 resulting
 formation
 of
 carbon
 and
 FexC
species
 are
 largely
 suppressed,
 therefore,
 propane
 cracking
 and
hydrogenolysis
 reactions
 are
 inhibited.
 Nevertheless,
 this
 is
 only
a
 simple
 reaction
 mechanism
 proposed
 based
 on
 our
 experiment
results,
 detailed
 work
 needs
 to
 be
 carried
 out
 to
 give
 an
 insight
 into
the
 explicit
 reaction
 mechanism.
