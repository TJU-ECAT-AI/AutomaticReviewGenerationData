The relation between tungsten and vanadium oxide species in V2O5AWO3/TiO2 catalysts for the selective
catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides by ammonia was studied with two series of catalysts containing
0.5–5 wt.% V2O5 and 0 or 10 wt.% WO3 impregnated onto a high surface-area titania hydrate of anatase
structure to keep theoretical surface coverages of the transition metal oxides 61. The catalysts, which
were investigated by XRD, nitrogen physisorption, Raman and EPR spectroscopy, temperature-pro-
grammed reduction (TPR), and catalytic reduction studies, all exhibited the well-known acceleration of
the SCR reaction by the tungsten promoter. From the EPR spectra and the TPR proﬁles, it was concluded
that the presence of tungsten induces the formation of a surface oxide phase with intimate mixing
between vanadium and tungsten oxide species instead of pronounced surface vanadium oxide island for-
mation, which was found in the absence of tungsten. This suggests that the promotional effect of tung-
sten may originate from a direct inﬂuence on the neighboring vanadium oxide species or from the
disruption of too large surface vanadium oxide ensembles.

1. Introduction
Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is a well-established technol-
ogy for the removal of harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) from station-
ary emission sources [1]. The ammonia reductant reduces NOx
selectively to nitrogen (e.g., for NO):
4NO þ 4NH3 þ O2 ! 4N2 þ 6H2O
Typical industrial catalysts contain V2O5 and WO3 supported on
TiO2 (anatase) [1]. Vanadium oxide is the active component, but
due to its toxicity and its activity for undesired SO2 oxidation, its
content is usually 62 wt.% [2,3]. WO3 is a promoter and stabilizer
[4,5], typically with an amount of 10 wt.%, which is described to in-
crease the activity, widen the temperature range in which the cat-
alysts are selective and to stabilize their physical surface area
[2,4,6,7]. These catalysts, which provide high NOx conversion and
N2 selectivity between 550 and 670 K [1,8], are often considered
to be technically mature and well studied. There are, however, com-
peting views on the origin of the promoting effect of the W
component.
It has long been known that the interaction of TiO2 with sup-
ported V(V) or W(VI) oxide species leads to surface oxide phases
with structures strongly different from those of the corresponding
bulk oxides [9,10]. In the case of vanadium, isolated surface oxide
species with a strongly distorted tetrahedral geometry were ob-
served in dehydrated samples at low V oxide coverage [10–15].
With increasing loading, two-dimensional islands of oligomeric
or polymeric metavanadate species are formed [9–11,14], and
crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles were observed at high vanadium
content [11,14]. There was a dispute if aggregates or oxide crystals
may occur at V oxide contents below the theoretical monolayer
coverage, but it was shown by surface analytical techniques that
in well-prepared catalysts, the surface oxide species do not grow
into the third dimension until the support is completely covered
by the two-dimensional surface oxide phase [16,17]. In dehydrated
WO3/TiO2 catalysts, strongly distorted octahedral surface species
((AO)5AW@O) were reported to predominate up to high tungsten
oxide coverage [11]. They were found to coexist with tetrahedral
monovanadate and polymeric surface vanadates in V2O5AWO3/
TiO2 catalysts: The abundance of the polymeric species increased
with increasing tungsten content at metal coverages which consid-
erably exceeded the monolayer limit if both metals were to com-
pete for the same surface sites [11].
There is remarkable agreement regarding the nature of the
active sites for ammonia-SCR in V2O5/TiO2. Although isolated

vanadium oxo sites were proposed in early studies [18], the partic-
ular role of oxo-bridged dimeric vanadium sites has been empha-
sized by many groups [19–23]. A stronger than proportional
increase of the catalytic activity with the vanadium content
[22,24] indeed supports the higher activity of dimeric (polymeric)
sites, but also indicates an activity of isolated V oxo centers. The
latter have been suggested to be an order of magnitude less active
but more selective for N2 formation [24]. Brønsted sites (VAOH)
have been found to be involved in the reaction as well [25–27].
The observations made with V2O5/TiO2 catalysts are well ex-
plained by a catalytic cycle proposed by Topsoe et al. [28–31] on
the basis of in situ FT-IR and online mass spectrometric studies,
which employs dimeric sites comprising both a VAOH and a
V@O entity.
Previous explanations for the promoting effect of the W com-
ponent in these catalysts rely on various experimental observa-
tions. Thus, their acidity was increased in the presence of
tungsten, which favors the ammonia supply for the reaction
[6,32]. Tungsten oxide was reported to delay the loss of BET sur-
face area [5,33] and the transformation from monomeric vanadyl
to crystalline V2O5 during aging [34]. It was also observed to in-
crease the reducibility of the V component [6], which might favor
the catalytic reaction. The aspect most closely related to the
above-mentioned concept of the active sites was, however, the
suggestion that the W component occupying a signiﬁcant part
of the support surface enforces a closer proximity on the surface
V oxide species encouraging thus the formation of the most active
VAOAV structures [6]. In the latter role, the tungsten species are
just spectators. One might, therefore, expect that similar activities
can be achieved also in absence of tungsten by systematically
decreasing the TiO2 surface area, but reports on such an approach
are not available.
We have now studied the inﬂuence of tungsten on V2O5/TiO2
catalysts for NH3-SCR by comparing two series of catalysts with
identical vanadium contents differing by the presence or absence
of 10 wt.% WO3. The catalysts were prepared by a method near
to industrial practice (incipient wetness impregnation). Deliber-
ately mild conditions were, however, chosen for the ﬁnal thermal
step (synthetic air, 623 K, 1 h), because we did not aim at maxi-
mum activity, instead the purpose was to ﬁx the species struc-
ture resulting from the impregnation by inducing condensation
with the support OH groups. The promotional effect of the tung-
sten was veriﬁed by catalytic investigation of the SCR activity,
and the structural properties of the samples were studied by
XRD, nitrogen physisorption, temperature-programmed reduc-
tion, EPR, and Raman spectroscopy. The data suggest that vana-
dium
and
tungsten
oxide
species
tend
to
create
a
mixed
surface oxide phase and that the effect of tungsten is rather to
prevent than to encourage island formation of the surface V
oxide component.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Samples were prepared starting from a titania hydrate in
the anatase modiﬁcation, for which an ignition loss of 11.9%, a
speciﬁc surface area of >250 m2/g, a density of 3.8 g/cm3, a sulfate
content of 62%, and impurity contents of Fe2O3 and Na2O
<100 ppm each are speciﬁed by the manufacturer. Sources for W
and
V
were

elements
<0.0088 wt.%) and ammonium meta vanadate (NH4VO3, Acros,
99%). The reaction feed was prepared from pre-mixed gas mixtures
(Air Liquide).
2.2. Catalyst preparation and characterization
WO3 was deposited on the TiO2 hydrate by wet impregnation of
APT from its aqueous solution, the concentration of which was
chosen to obtain a tungsten oxide loading of 10.0 wt.%. Subse-
quently, the material was dried at 383 K overnight and calcined
at 713 K for 1 h (heating ramp 2 K/min to 400 K, then 5 K/min, in
ﬂowing synthetic air, 20% O2/He), which brought the BET surface
area down to 140 m2/g.
The WO3/TiO2 material and the initial TiO2 hydrate were wet
impregnated with an aqueous NH4VO3 solution to obtain loadings
of 0.5, 1.5, 3.0, and 5.0 wt.% V2O5. The eight resulting catalysts were
dried overnight at 383 K and calcined in O2/He (20% O2, synthetic
air) at 623 K for 1 h, which will be denoted as ‘‘reference calcina-
tion’’. These materials will be labeled W10Vx and Vx, respectively,
where x reports the V2O5 content (wt%). For reference purposes,
one V2O5/TiO2 catalyst (5 wt.% V2O5) was made with a BET surface
area similar to those of the tungsten-containing catalysts (cf.
Section 3.1.) by employing the TiO2 hydrate after a calcination at
673 K for 1 h resulting in a BET surface area of 128 m2=g ð! V
5:0Þ.
Speciﬁc surface areas of the catalysts were determined by nitro-
gen physisorption using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 MP instru-
ment. Prior to analysis, the samples were outgassed for 2 h at
573 K. The XRD measurements were performed with a D8 Advance
instrument (Bruker AXS), using Cu Ka radiation (0.15413 nm,
40 kV, 40 mA). Temperature-programmed reduction was made
with 4.5% H2 in Ar, ramping the temperature to 1073 K or 1273 K
at 10 K min1. The efﬂuent gas was analyzed by a Hydros thermal
conductivity detector (Fisher-Rosemount).
The EPR spectra of dehydrated samples (1 h at 623 K in Ar) were
measured with an ELEXSYS 500–10/12 CW spectrometer (Bruker)
using a microwave frequency of 9.5 GHz (X band), a power of
6.3 mW, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and a modulation
amplitude of 0.5 mT. Spectra were recorded at 77 K. Spectral inten-
sities were normalized on the sample mass. Therefore, intensities
are
directly
comparable,
although
an
integration
was
not
performed. The simulation of the EPR spectra was done by the
program SIM14S [35] (version 06/09/1991).
FT-Raman spectra of dehydrated samples (1 h at 623 K in Ar)
were measured with a Thermo Nicolet Vectra Plus Instrument
using a laser wavelength of 1064 nm (NIR) at 370 mW. The spec-
trometer resolution was 4 cm1. The resultant interferograms were
collected with a liquid nitrogen-cooled Ge detector; the spectra
were visualized with the OMNIC 6.2 software. Some spectra (see
legend to Fig. 7b) were measured with a DRX Raman Microscope
(Thermo Scientiﬁc).
2.3. Catalytic measurements
The catalysts were pressed and sieved to arrive at a grain size of
250–350 lm. Their activity was studied in a micro ﬂow reactor (in-
ner diameter – 4.2 mm) with a feed gas mixture containing
1000 ppm NO, 1000 ppm NH3, and 2% O2 in He. The experiments
were
made
with

of
3.3  103 g s ml1
(catalyst

–

deduced from the bed height obtained, this results in a GHSV of
750,000 h1. In the experiments, the temperature was raised to
the reaction temperatures at 5 K min1 and conversions were re-
corded after the steady state had been attained. Data obtained be-
tween 423 and 723 K will be reported in this paper, although the
conversions achieved above the calcination temperature of 623 K
cannot be referred to the initial state of the catalysts.
NO and NH3 conversions were determined with a non-disper-
sive IR photometer (XStream, Emerson). An NO2 analyzer in the
analytical scheme did not indicate formation of sizable amounts

of NO2. In these experiments, N2O was not analyzed. However, in
similar experiments with a different series of V2O5AWO3/TiO2 cat-
alysts [36,37], the nitrogen selectivity remained typically >95% be-
low 723 K.
3. Results
3.1. Texture studies
In Table 1, the BET surface areas of the catalysts and the titania
hydrate, all after the reference calcination (623 K, 1 h), are summa-
rized and employed for the evaluation of transition metal surface
coverage data. The surface areas of the tungsten-containing cata-
lysts are between 115 and 125 m2/g, those of the tungsten-free
samples between 175 and 225 m2/g. Unexpectedly, there is no in-
verse relation between BET surface area and vanadium content,
although surface vanadium oxide species have been described to
destabilize the texture of TiO2. A parallel trend can be noted in both
series, although the changes between the W-containing catalysts
seem to be near the limits of experimental error. However, it seems
signiﬁcant that the lowest BET surface area occurs with 1.5 wt.%
V2O5, for reasons which have not been understood so far. It is also
remarkable that the BET surface area of all tungsten-containing
catalysts fell short of 140 m2/g, although the ﬁnal calcination tem-
perature (623 K) was well below that employed to establish the
140 m2/g of the WO3/TiO2 precursor.
Table 1 indicates a failure in our initial intention to keep the BET
surface areas of both series in a comparable range. This means that
indeed two parameters are changed between these two series: the
presence of tungsten and the BET surface area. It will be seen
below, however, that this drawback will not interfere with the con-
clusions to be drawn from the data. Sample V
5:0 with a BET surface
area comparable to that of the W-containing catalysts has been
included in the study to remove remaining doubt.
For the evaluation of the theoretical surface coverage of the tran-
sition metal oxide species, different parameters for their areal
monolayer density are available in the literature: according to
[38], 12.7 lmol V or 6.8 lmol W can be accommodated per m2 sup-
port surface; according to [39], the densities are somewhat less
(10.4 lmol V or 4.6 lmol W per m2). In Table 1, coverage degrees
according to both sets of density data are given. For the tungsten-
containing catalysts, the coverage can be differentiated with the
W/V atomic ratios reported in the last column. It can be seen that
the V-only catalysts are very dilute whereas in the tungsten-con-
taining samples the TiO2 appears to be largely covered by the sup-
ported species, in particular at the higher vanadium oxide contents.
In Fig. 1, XRD patterns of some catalysts are compared with that
of the titania hydrate, after the reference calcination. The diffracto-
grams are dominated by the reﬂections of anatase, their consider-
able width indicates a small primary particle size, which may be
evaluated by the Scherrer equation. Particle sizes may be also esti-
mated from the BET surface areas (Table 1) via dBET = 6/(qSBET),
where q is the material density. For the titania hydrate, the BET
surface area provides a much smaller particle size than XRD
(dBET  6 nm, dXRD = 11.8 nm, from the (101) reﬂection). This
suggests a strong surface roughness of the particles, a crystalline
core being probably surrounded by an amorphous, porous overlay-
er. With the loss of surface area due to the inﬂuence of the impreg-
nated vanadium, the discrepancy decreased somewhat: for V5.0 the
corresponding diameters were dBET  7.5 nm and dXRD = 11.4 nm.
The best coincidence was obtained with the tungsten-containing
samples, which had experienced the intermediate calcination at
713 K. Here, the BET-derived sizes (13.7, 12.9, and 14.2 nm for
W10V1.5, W10V5.0, and V
5:0) compare well with 14.1, 12.2, and
15.0 nm obtained from the diffractograms.
For all catalysts, the presence of crystalline WO3 and V2O5 can
be excluded on the basis of the diffractograms (Fig. 1) even in sam-
ples where the theoretical surface coverage degree of the transition
metal oxides is near or above 1 (cf. Table 1). There is a tiny hump at
2H = 26.65  in the diffractogram of V5.0, which is near to reﬂec-
tions expected for WO3 and V2O5. The latter are, however, minor
signals in the reﬂection patterns of the oxides, and the more prom-
inent signals are missing. Apparently, the peak arises from minor
amounts of quartz present in the sample analyzed ((101) reﬂec-
tion at 26.64). There was not any V2O5 signal in the XRD pattern
of V
5:0 either (not shown).
3.2. Catalytic properties
The catalytic activities of our catalysts are summarized in Fig. 2
where the temperature dependence of NO and NH3 conversions
are shown and the temperature range above the calcination temper-
ature has been shaded. The promotion effect of tungsten is clearly
visible: at all vanadium contents, the conversion curve of the tung-
sten-containing samples rises at lower temperature. The ammonia
oxidation tendency was very low in all cases. From the curves in
Fig. 2a through d, it is also obvious that the SCR activity increases
with the vanadium content both in presence and absence of tung-
sten. One may be tempted to examine the relation between activity
and vanadium content from these data to conﬁrm the more than
proportional relation between them reported in [22,24]. We have
attempted this despite the fact that for all suitable temperatures
the conversions range from extremely small, not very accurate
values till far outside the differential range. Treating the integral

data with an assumed ﬁrst-order rate law, we indeed conﬁrmed the
expected more than proportional relation except for data points too
close to the conversion maxima (e.g. in Fig. 2d), but due to the prob-
lems mentioned above this result should not be overemphasized.
Remarkably, the promotion effect is very pronounced just at
5 wt.% V2O5 where a theoretical surface vanadium oxide coverage
of 20–25% should give rise to abundant VAOAV pair formation al-
ready without promotion by tungsten.
3.3. Structural characterization of the vanadium phase
3.3.1. EPR spectroscopy
The EPR spectra of tungsten-free samples and tungsten-con-
taining samples, all measured at 77 K, are compared in Fig. 3 on
the same intensity scale. Examples for the spectral simulation are
given in Fig. 4. The g and A values resulting from the simulation
and the relative intensities Irel (related to the intensity of one of
the hyperﬁne structure (hfs) signals) are summarized in Tables 2
and 3. These tables report also the parameter Dg||/Dg\ (with
Dg|| = g||  ge, Dg\ = g\  ge; ge = 2.0023 for the free electron),
which measures the axial distortion of the V4+ center [40,41],
and the in-plane delocalization coefﬁcient b2
2 [41], which is a mea-
sure of the extent to which the single electron is delocalized
toward the O ligands in the equatorial plane of the O4V@O site,
i.e., for the degree of covalence of the VAO bonds. b2
2 was obtained
from Eq. (1), where the element-speciﬁc parameter P, which covers
the relation between Bohr magneton lb and nuclear magneton lN,
was set to 184.5 G for a free V4+ ion [42]. b2

ization of the unpaired electron at the vanadium nucleus.

The tungsten-free samples were dominated by a broad isotropic
singlet which is due to the clustered VAOAV species (Fig. 3a) and
increased with increasing vanadium loading. In addition, a hyper-
ﬁne structure signal typical of an isolated VO2+ species can be ob-
served in all samples. In presence of tungsten, the isotropic
singlet can be also discerned (Fig. 3b), but it is much less intense
than in the tungsten-free catalysts. Instead, the signals of the iso-
lated VO2+ species are more complicated, which suggests the pres-
ence of at least two different sites. From the spectra, it should be
expected that the intensity ratio between the isotropic signal and
those of the isolated sites is much larger in the absence of tungsten.
These spectra have been simulated to derive the spectral
parameters and relative intensity of signals. Apart from signals of
isolated and clustered V4+ species, a signal for an O
2 species was
included in the case of tungsten-containing catalysts. Such species
had been observed on the bare TiO2 support and, with enhanced
intensity,
on
the
WO3/TiO2
precursor
[36].
Notably,
no
tungsten-derived signals could be found on WO3/TiO2 [36], there-
fore such signals were not included in the analysis of the
V2O5AWO3/TiO2 catalysts.

Examples for the quality of the simulation are given in Fig. 4.
While a better coincidence between experimental and simulated
signals would have been desirable in particular for the tungsten-
free catalysts (cf. Fig. 4a, central part between 3250 and 3350 G),
the major features are apparently reproduced by the model. Most
of the divergences can be traced back to a limitation of the soft-
ware which does not allow using different line widths for the indi-
vidual hyperﬁne lines, although variations are obvious. In the V
multiplets, the positions of the outermost A|| hyperﬁne lines at
low and high ﬁeld are well ﬁtted in all cases which suggests that
the number of superimposed signals and, thus, of different single
VO2+ sites, and their basic parameters (g and A values) are basically
correct.
In absence of tungsten, the hyperﬁne structure signal of isolated
VO2+ could be ﬁtted with almost identical parameters in all sam-
ples (Table 2, species 1). Both axial distortion (Dg||/Dg\ = 2.15)
and degree of delocalization (b2
2 ¼ 0:56) do not depend on the
vanadia loading. At low vanadium content, a second hfs signal
can be observed, but it could be simulated only for V0.5 (Table 2,
species 2). This VO2þ species has a slightly lower axial distortion
(Dg||/Dg\ = 1.96), and the unpaired electron is closer to the V4+
center (b2
2 ¼ 0:77). However, compared to the signal of the
clustered phase, the hfs signals are minor. In V0.5, the isotropic
signal is 50 times more intense than the latter, and its predomi-
nance increases with the vanadium content: in V5 the intensity
ratio (Irel) is as large as 340, although the theoretical coverage of
the surface V oxide species is on the order of only 0.2.
In the spectra of the tungsten-containing samples, two signals
of isolated VO2þ species were always found (Fig. 3b, Fig. 4b–d,
Table 3). The spectral parameters of these signals are different from

those in absence of vanadium; therefore they have been labeled
species 3 and 4, although their properties vary with the V content
unlike those of the major species in absence of tungsten. The var-
iation concerns, in particular, the degree of axial distortion (Dg||/
Dg\ of species 3 ranging from 2.36 at 0.5 wt.% V2O5 to 3.2–3.3 at
3–5 wt.% V2O5, species 4 from 2.85 at 0.5 wt.% V2O5 to 4.83
5 wt.% V2O5), while the location of the unpaired electron is rather
similar in all cases and closer to V than in absence of tungsten
(b2
2 ¼ 0:81  0:88). Species 4 is apparently more strongly distorted
than species 3. There is also a broad isotropic signal in presence of
tungsten. Notably, its intensity ratio to the hfs signals is much
smaller than in absence of tungsten. It increases very moderately
with the vanadium content, just doubling from 5 to 10 at a tenfold
increase of the vanadium loading.
3.3.2. Temperature-programmed reduction
In Fig. 5, TPR proﬁles of reference samples are compared with
those of some catalysts in order to derive an assignment for the
features observed. The hydrogen consumption data are summa-
rized in Table 4. The TiO2 hydrate gave a reduction signal between
630 and 850 K, which can be assigned to the reduction of the
sulfate species to SO2. It comprises three sub-signals at 643 K,
753 K, and 813 K which indicates a strong heterogeneity of the sur-
face sulfate species [43]. The hydrogen consumption (Table 4) is
well in agreement with a sulfate content of 2 wt. In the V2O5/
TiO2 catalysts, the sulfate was co-reduced with the vanadium at
lower temperatures (see V1.5 in Fig. 5, with a peak temperature
of 740 K, and Fig. 6a). Tungsten oxide supported on the TiO2 hy-
drate was reduced in two steps (Fig. 5, W10). The hydrogen con-
sumption data conﬁrm that the ﬁrst step at 860 K originates
from the reduction of W(VI) to W(IV), which is reduced to W(0)
in the second peak around 1160 K. In presence of vanadium
(W10V1.5), there are indeed three signals, but with unexpected rela-
tion of the hydrogen consumption. The W(VI) ? W(IV) reduction
peak is much smaller than in W10, whereas the signal for vanadia
reduction is large. This suggests that tungsten ions in the vicinity
of surface vanadium oxide species are coreduced with the latter
and only non-interacting surface tungsten oxide species show up
at 860 K.
The TPR proﬁles of all catalysts are displayed in Fig. 6. In ab-
sence of tungsten, the vanadium was always reduced in one step,
which superimposes the sulfate reduction. With growing vanadia
content, the peak temperature decreased from 800 K (V0.5) to
720 K (V5.0). V
5:0 reduced in a somewhat broader single peak cen-
tered at 745 K (not shown). The hydrogen consumptions indicate
a reduction of V(V) to V(III), the remaining consumption agreeing
roughly with the reduction of ca. 2 wt.% sulfate (Table 4). In pres-
ence of tungsten, the three-peak pattern discussed above can be
seen in all cases (Fig. 6b). The central peak representative for sur-
face tungstate not interacting with surface vanadate was always
smaller than in vanadium-free W10 (light-gray trace at the bottom
of the diagram). The signals have been ﬁtted with Gaussian lines to
estimate the H2 consumptions for the individual species, and the
results are given in Table 4. The accuracy of these data is limited
because possible increases of the baseline at high temperatures
(cf. Fig. 6a) would have exaggerated the values for the high-tem-
perature signal. However, it is clear that the hydrogen consump-
tion of the 860 K signal is always smaller than expected, and the
consumption in the ﬁrst signal signiﬁcantly exceeds the sum of
consumptions due to sulfate and vanadium reduction. The latter
difference may be even underestimated because the total H2 con-
sumption measured was always short of the expected value (sum
of consumptions for V, W, and sulfate species), and there was no
sulfate peak discernible in the proﬁle of W10 (Fig. 5). Probably,
the intermediate calcination of the tungsten-containing support
at 713 K had resulted in a signiﬁcant loss of sulfate, therefore the

excess consumption during V(V) reduction is most likely larger
than suggested by the ﬁgures in Table 4.
The proﬁles of the samples with high vanadium content exhibit
another remarkable feature – a sharp peak preceding the top of the
signal assigned to coreduction of interacting surface vanadium and
tungsten oxide species. The peak shape is reminiscent of the signal
shapes obtained in absence of tungsten (Fig. 6a). This suggests that
the narrow tip may originate from separate surface vanadium
oxide species, which are not inﬂuenced by surface tungstates. At
1.5 wt.% V2O5 and below, such narrow signal was not observed.
On the basis of the proposed assignment, this would mean that
practically all of the surface vanadate species are in the vicinity
of surface tungstate species, only at higher vanadium content, a
signiﬁcant amount of surface vanadium oxide islands or clusters
is present.
3.4. Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy is the method that has provided most
information on the speciation of vanadium sites in supported vana-
dium oxide catalysts so far. FT-Raman spectra of the initial titania
hydrate and of an anatase and a rutile reference are presented in
Fig. 7a, whereas the spectra of the catalysts V1.5, W10V1.5, V5.0,
and W10V5.0 are depicted in Fig. 7b. In the bare support (Fig. 7a),
the signal position of all lines agree very well with those of the ref-
erence anatase, although the lines are signiﬁcantly broader. The
latter explains why the overtone of the 395 cm1 vibration at
796 cm1 is not resolved. Although the anatase structure can be
clearly identiﬁed for the support, differences in the intensity distri-
bution between the major signals at 638 cm1, 515 cm1, and
395 cm1 should be noted. In particular, the Eg vibrations [44]
(638 cm1, also 197 cm1 and 150 cm1, which are cut off in
Fig. 7) are less distinct in the titania hydrate than in the reference
anatase.
Surprisingly, no signals for surface vanadium or tungsten oxide
species could be found in the spectrum of W10V1.5 (Fig. 7b). The
intensity distribution between the major bands at 638 cm1,
515 cm1, and 395 cm1 was slightly changed, with a somewhat
higher intensity at 638 cm1, but there was no signal between
800 and 1100 cm1 except for the very weak overtone at ca.
800 cm1. Fig. 7b contains also a spectrum measured with the
same catalyst after a thermal treatment (873 K, 4 h) which brought
the BET surface down to 71 m2/g. Here, a signal of the supported
species is clearly discernible. In Fig. 7a, a spectrum of the TiO2
hydrate calcined to bring its BET surface area down to 128 m2/g
(673 K, 1 h) is presented as well. The shifts in the intensity distri-
bution of the anatase bands are very similar to those in W10V1.5.
With the highest vanadium oxide content, it was possible to
detect signals of the supported species even after the reference cal-
cination. In V5.0, a signal at 1026 cm1 can be clearly discerned.
When 5 wt.% V2O5 were supported on the precalcined TiO2 (V
5:0),
the signal became broad, extending to wave numbers below
1000 cm1, although there was still intensity around 1030 cm1.
The spectrum of W10V5.0 was almost identical with that of V
5:0.
No signals of surface tungsten oxide species could be observed
on a vanadium-free catalyst (W10) which was calcined to achieve a
BET surface area of ca. 80 m2/g (not shown).

purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of surface tung-
state species on the vanadium oxide speciation, the samples delib-
erately deviated from technical catalysts: ﬁrst, in their large BET
surface area, because the theoretical transition metal oxide surface
coverage was to be kept below 1, and second, in their thermal his-
tory. It is known that calcination at high temperatures may im-
prove
the
activity
of
V2O5AWO3/TiO2
catalysts
[3].
Here,
exposure to T > 623 K was avoided to conﬁne solid-state reactions
to the ﬁxation of the impregnated transition metal oxide species to
the support. The catalytic data obtained with these samples (Fig. 2)
show that the typical promotion effect of tungsten was obtained
despite these deviations. This holds, in particular, for the boost of
activity caused by the tungsten promoter: at identical V2O5 con-
tent, the NO conversions always increased at signiﬁcantly lower
temperatures in presence of tungsten. Remarkably, this effect is
most pronounced at large vanadium contents. The reported widen-
ing of the temperature window for the selective NO reduction
[2,4,6] cannot be conﬁrmed with the present set of samples as their
structure might change above the calcination temperature of
623 K.
4.2. Raman spectra
The study of the structural properties of the supported vana-
dium and tungsten oxide species by Raman spectroscopy provided
less information than expected. No crystalline V or W oxide phases
were detected by XRD (Fig. 1), but the direct observation of surface
vanadate or tungstate species by Raman spectroscopy [9–11,14]
was possible only at the highest vanadium oxide loading. Appar-
ently, the signals seen there were all due to surface V oxide species

because no signals were detected on a tungsten-only catalyst with
the spectrometer used. Indeed, it has been reported that the Raman
cross sections of supported tungsten oxide species are signiﬁcantly
smaller than that of supported V oxide species [11].
The comparison of spectra taken with W10V1.5 after the refer-
ence calcination and after thermal treatment at 873 K (Fig. 7b) sug-
gests that the failure to detect the supported V oxide species is not
due to insufﬁcient sensitivity of the spectrometer. Instead, we be-
lieve it may be due to a strong energetic heterogeneity of the spe-
cies on the high surface area support. This would cause distortions
of the coordination polyhedra and inﬂuence the V@O wave num-
bers resulting in broadening of the corresponding signals [45] up
to their disappearance in the background. On the other hand, sig-
nals of three-dimensional oxide phases (V2O5, WO3), which are
traced by their characteristic bands (V2O5 – 994 cm1, WO3 –
800 cm1) with great sensitivity due to the generally large interac-
tion cross sections of the bulk oxide phases [11,46–48], were not
found either. Therefore, the expected two-dimensional structure
of the surface vanadium and tungsten oxide phase can be sup-
ported indirectly at least.
The signal at 1026 cm1 observed in the spectrum of V5.0 can be
assigned to isolated surface vanadium oxide species [11]. Its broad-
ening toward lower wave number in V
5:0 is difﬁcult to explain be-
cause the V@O bonds in surface polyvanadate species, which
should be more abundant given the lower surface area of the sup-
port, are rather expected at higher wave numbers [49]. One might
assume that the broadening is a result of the more intense very
broad structure centered around 930 cm1, which is due to VAOAV
vibrations in polyvanadates. Due to the low Raman interaction cross
sections of these species, their presence already in V5.0 cannot be
excluded on the basis of the spectrum in Fig. 7b. In the spectrum
measured with the tungsten-containing catalyst (W10V5.0), the
broadening may also contain intensity from VAOAW structures.
It should be also noted that the spectra of the supported cata-
lysts are still signiﬁcantly different from that of the reference ana-
tase. In the initial titania hydrate, a defective structure may be
assumed, where a distortion of the tetragonal anatase structure
has a particular effect on the symmetry of the multidimensional
vibrations. Indeed, the discrepancy between particle diameters de-
duced from nitrogen physisorption and from XRD (section 3.1) sug-
gests the presence of porous, disordered material to which the
effect might be ascribed. However, this does not hold for W10V1.5
where the BET surface area had decreased by more than 50% and
particle dimensions from the BET surface area and the diffracto-
grams were close. The spectrum taken from the bare support cal-
cined down to 128 m2/g (Fig. 7a) shows that the structural
distortions are not induced by the transition metal oxide species
loaded on the surface of W10V1.5 – which would have been surpris-
ing for particles of >10 nm diameter. Instead, we believe that the
deviating pattern of Raman intensities arises from an internal
defectivity of the TiO2 particles, which needs temperatures in ex-
cess of 713 K (calcination temperature of the WO3/TiO2 precursor)
to be healed. This defectivity may have contributed to the struc-
tural heterogeneity of the surface vanadates and tungstates which
has probably impeded their observation in the Raman spectra.
4.3. EPR spectra
In the EPR spectra, V(IV) defects in the fully oxidized catalysts
are detected. The relative abundance of these defects has been
reported to be in the order of 8–10% in this type of catalyst [6].
However, this relative abundance may be different for each species
identiﬁed, e.g., for all types of VO2+ sites discussed below. Strictly
speaking, it may differ even for the (most likely two-dimensional)
clusters causing the singlet signals in presence or absence of tung-
sten because of the differences in the g values (Tables 2 and 3).
Therefore, the signal intensity ratios reported should not be under-
stood as concentration ratios, and even the trends which will be
outlined are not conclusive on their own unless conﬁrmed by an
independent method. This conﬁrmation was obtained by the TPR
results (vide infra).
The most striking feature of the EPR study is the pronounced
difference in the clustering (viz., island formation) tendency of
the surface vanadium oxide species in presence or absence of tung-
sten (Fig. 3). Without tungsten, a strong isotropic singlet of inter-
acting V(IV) ions was obtained already at a theoretical surface
coverage of just 2–3% (V0.5). The further increase of the intensity
ratio between this singlet and the isolated V sites with growing
vanadium content (Table 2) is no surprise on this background. In
the presence of tungsten, the singlet signal is much smaller, actu-
ally hardly to be seen on the same intensity scale up to 1.5 wt.%
V2O5 (Fig. 3b), and despite the mentioned risks due to possible dif-
ferent defect formation tendencies, the conclusion that tungsten
suppresses island formation of the surface vanadium oxide species
appears quite plausible. This may be due to an afﬁnity of surface
tungsten and vanadium oxide sites to interact with each other
for energetic reasons, or it may be a consequence of the tendency
of surface tungstates to form isolated sites even at high coverage
[11], which would leave limited space for island formation from
a second component.
In absence of tungsten, up to two signals of isolated vanadium
oxide sites were identiﬁed on top of the singlet signal. In the litera-
ture, similar signals were assigned to VO2+ interacting with TiO2
alone or with sulfate and TiO2 [41,50]. In our study, signal (2) was ob-
served only at 0.5 and 1.5 wt.% V2O5, too weak for reliable simulation
in the latter case. This suggests its assignment to the sulfate-related
site, because the concentration of sulfate is ﬁxed and the abundance
of isolated vanadium oxide sites interacting with it should decrease
as these sites would be more and more included into islands. Indeed,
there is fair agreement between the spectral parameters of this sig-
nal and the corresponding signals assigned to sulfate-related VO2+
by other authors (Table 2, signals labeled ‘‘2’’). Signal 1 arises, there-
fore, from VO2+ sites interacting with the TiO2 surface only. Here, the
considerable deviation of the spectral parameters from those re-
ported in the literature (Table 2) is surprising. This divergence might
be assigned to difference in surface properties of the anatase sup-
ports. The better coincidence of the spectral parameters of the sul-
fate-related VO2+ may indicate that the properties of this site are
dominated by the interaction with the sulfate species.
In the presence of tungsten, two signals of isolated VO2+ species
were observed, which differed from those found in absence of
tungsten not only by their spectral parameters, but also by the
dependence of the latter on the vanadium content (Table 3). Given
the deviations in the spectral parameters of VO2+ on different ana-
tase supports, the moderate difference in the properties of signal 1
and signal 3 (in W10V0.5) would not sufﬁce to conclude an inﬂuence
of tungsten on the latter, but the continuous increase of the axial
distortion (Dg||/Dg\) with the vanadium content both in signal 3
and 4 strongly suggests such interaction. Both signals apparently
reﬂect a certain average number of tungsten atoms around the
vanadium site. As it is unlikely that the distribution of such ‘‘coor-
dination numbers’’ would be bimodal in all samples, there must be
another difference causing the presence of two well-deﬁned sig-
nals in all cases. A tentative explanation might be the vicinity of
isolated vanadate and tungstate sites reﬂected in signal 3, whereas
signal 4 might arise from species involving (an) oxygen bridge(s)
(VAOAW) between them.
The above-mentioned increase of the axial distortion may indi-
cate a growing interaction of the isolated vanadium site with tung-
state neighbors, which is not á priori plausible at decreasing W/V
ratio. A tentative explanation would rely on the tendency of sur-
face vanadate and tungstate species to interact with each other

(vide supra), enhanced by the decreasing availability of free surface
area. In Fig. 3b, it can be observed that the singlet signal did not
show a continuous increase with the vanadium content but was
smallest in W10V1.5. At a surface coverage of 0.6. . .0.8 (W10V0.5,
see Table 1), there seems to be sufﬁcient space to form some sur-
face vanadium oxide islands even in presence of the surface tung-
state phase. However, the spectroscopic difference of the isolated
sites (in particular site 4) from those found in absence of tungsten
(Tables 2 and 3) indicates that pairing between surface vanadium
and tungsten oxide species already competes with island forma-
tion. With decreasing available space, the vanadium islands would
be ﬁrst consumed by the WAV pairing tendency and then reap-
pear, maybe in smaller size, due to the abundance of vanadium
oxide species to be accommodated at the highest vanadium con-
tents. The very low intensity of these singlet signals as compared
to those of the tungsten-free samples (Fig. 3) may suggest that a
relatively small part of the vanadium is engaged in the islands.
Hence, a large quantity of vanadium has to be separated by the
tungsten present in particular at the higher vanadium contents.
At W/V ratios approaching equimolarity, this will lead to a well-
mixed surface oxide phase. As free space is less and less available
with increasing transition metal oxide loading, the vanadium oxide
sites will have to be surrounded more and more completely by
tungstate species to avoid island formation, which might explain
the increased distortion of the isolated V sites.
4.4. Temperature-programmed reduction
The TPR proﬁles conﬁrm this model to a large extent. V2O5AWO3/
TiO2 catalysts were subjected to temperature-programmed reduc-
tion earlier [43,51], and the basic patterns observed in our study
were known before. An excess of the hydrogen consumption over
the expectations for V(V) reduction was noted by Reiche et al. in
their report on the V2O5AWO3/TiO2 Eurocat round robin [51], and
shoulders at the low- and high-temperature side of the ﬁrst peak
were mentioned. On the Eurocat, the ﬁrst peak appeared at signiﬁ-
cantly higher temperature than in our case (845 K vs. 735–780 K),
although the temperature region of the high-temperature peak
was similar (1140 K vs. >1100 K except for W10V5.0, peaks are cut
off in Fig. 6b). The larger intermediate temperature range in our case
may have favored the detection of the weak signals assigned to sur-
face tungsten oxide species not in interaction with vanadia.
To the best of our knowledge, the observation of this signal and
also of a sharp tip at the low-temperature signals at higher vana-
dium content (Fig. 6b) assignable to surface vanadia islands is
new. It permits assigning the excess H2 consumption of the ﬁrst
peak to W(VI) species interacting with surface vanadia species.
Although the quantitative evaluation of component signals in the
interval between the two main peaks is not very accurate, the data
suggest that ever more surface tungsten oxide species interact
with the vanadium oxide with increasing V content. On the other
hand, nearly all surface vanadate species are in interaction with
tungsten oxide sites at low vanadium content, whereas at high
vanadia loadings, some island formation is indicated by the TPR
proﬁles, in good agreement with the conclusions from EPR.
4.5. Consequences for the promoting inﬂuence of tungsten in
V2O5AWO3/TiO2 catalysts
The observations made in this study are at variance with the
view that the promoting effect of tungsten in V2O5AWO3/TiO2
SCR catalysts can be explained by a mere compression of the sur-
face vanadate phase by the competition for the support surface,
which would induce formation of highly active VAOAV paired
structures from less active isolated vanadium oxide sites. In partic-
ular, our EPR study shows that the extent of (two-dimensional)
clustering is much larger in tungsten-free catalysts, it is instead re-
duced by the introduction of tungsten. When such disruption of
surface vanadia islands causes sizeable increases of the catalytic
activity, a different explanation for the promotional effect has to
be found.
The isolated sites detected by EPR might be seen as candidates
for the explanation of this effect. On the basis of the present data,
such hypothesis cannot be appropriately examined as the intro-
duction of tungsten most likely changes two parameters at the
same time – the abundance and the structure of the sites (cf. spec-
tral parameters in Tables 2 and 3). From an investigation of ther-
mal treatments with W10V1.5, which will be reported in a future
pair of papers [37,52], we can, however, exclude all species detect-
able by EPR (including the singlet signal) from being relevant for
the catalytic activity because catalyst states with very different
catalytic behavior were found to provide identical EPR spectra. This
is not really surprising because the binuclear VAOAV sites favored
by most groups cannot be singled out in our spectra: they might
contribute to the singlet, where they are heavily superimposed
by signals from larger entities, or they might produce a signal with
different axial distortion (V(IV)AOAV(V) bound to the support),
which would be enhanced with the vanadium content. This was,
however, not observed.
Our interpretation is therefore that the promotion effect of
tungsten is just related to its ability to prevent excessive VxOy is-
land formation and to create a mixed surface phase with small sur-
face vanadium and tungsten oxide entities. Among these entities,
the isolated sites can be detected by EPR, but one can expect that
the structure created contains binary sites as well, maybe trimers
and other oligomers of low nuclearity. As a grave inﬂuence of
three-dimensional clustering may be ruled out for our catalysts,
samples with identical vanadium content will expose the same
number of vanadium sites – once predominantly in more or less
extended islands (V2O5/TiO2), once predominantly in isolated sites
and small oligomers with tungstate neighbors (V2O5AWO3/TiO2).
The signiﬁcantly larger activity of the latter may be due to a spe-
ciﬁc inﬂuence of the tungstate species on the nearby vanadate sites
or to a superior activity of binuclear VAOAV sites (or small oligo-
mers) compared with VAOAV entities in extended islands. A deci-
sion between these choices cannot be made on the basis of the
evidence presented so far. Results of the above-mentioned study
about the effect of thermal stress on W10V1.5, which will be pub-
lished in the future [37,52], will provide some evidence in favor
of the second explanation.
5. Conclusions
By studying V2O5/TiO2 catalysts of varying V2O5 content with
and without 10 wt.% WO3 by electron-paramagnetic resonance
and temperature-programmed reduction, it has been found that
the structure of the surface vanadium oxide species is strongly per-
turbed in presence of surface tungstate species. In absence of WO3,
the surface vanadates exhibit a pronounced tendency to island for-
mation, which is strongly suppressed in presence of tungsten.
From the TPR proﬁles, it may be suggested that most of the surface
tungstate species are surrounded by surface vanadates and vice
versa, i.e., a well-mixed surface oxide phase is formed instead of
a system of coexisting islands. Explanations for the promoting ef-
fect of tungsten should be sought in the intimate mixing between
the transition metal oxide species rather than in a compression of
the surface vanadate phase by the coexisting surface tungstate
phase. They may include speciﬁc effects of the tungstate species
on neighboring vanadium sites or a superior activity of small (di-
meric, oligomeric) vanadium sites as compared to sites in extended
islands.
