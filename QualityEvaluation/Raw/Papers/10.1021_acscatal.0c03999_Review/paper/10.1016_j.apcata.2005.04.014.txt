Abstract
In connection with the speciﬁc requirements of the hydrotreating of FCC gasoline, the selectivity of hydrotreating catalysts in
hydrodesulfurization with respect to the hydrogenation of oleﬁns has to be controlled and if possible improved. The aim of this study
was, on the one hand, to ascertain the role of Co and Ni on the activity of MoS2 catalysts in the activation of dihydrogen and in the
hydrogenation of oleﬁns and, on the other hand, to identify the origin of the hydrogen involved in the hydrogenation reaction.
It was shown that the promotion effect of Ni on both the hydrogenation of cyclopentene (150 8C, ﬁxed bed reactor) and the hydrogenation
of propene (80 8C, recycling reactor) was higher than that of Co. This is in accordance with the fact that CoMo catalysts are more efﬁcient in
the selective hydrodesulfurization of FCC gasoline than NiMo catalysts.
The hydrogenation of propene was carried out on catalyst samples, which were pre-treated with D2S at the reaction temperature (80 8C)
then with helium at 200 8C in order to desorb part of it. Under these conditions it was shown that D-atoms coming from D2S were added to
propene to form mainly mono-deuterated propane. No isotopic exchange between propane and D2 was detected under these conditions. The
comparison of the initial product distributions in propane and in gas phase hydrogen indicated that D-atoms issuing from D2S were added to
propene directly. This was particularly clear with the NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst and also with the non-promoted catalyst. With the CoMo/Al2O3
catalyst, the activity in isotopic exchange was so high that the complete H–D scrambling between D2S and H2 occurred even at very low
hydrogenation conversion so that it was not possible to conclude. It was also found that the presence of gas phase hydrogen was necessary for
the reaction to occur, which is considered further evidence in favour of the heterolytic dissociation of H2 on sulﬁdes.

1. Introduction
Because of increasing environmental concern and pertain-
ing regulations, hydrotreating has become more and more
important in reﬁning with the objective of removing as much
as possible of the sulfur impurities from petroleum products
[1–7]. The catalysts have to be very efﬁcient in hydro-
desulfurization and, at the same time, the consumption of
hydrogen has to be limited. Regarding the gasoline pool, the
sulfur content depends essentially on the fraction coming
from catalytic cracking (FCC). In this particular case, the
selectivity in hydrodesulfurization with respect to the
hydrogenation of oleﬁns has to be controlled in order to
limit the octane rating loss. Several factors can inﬂuence this
selectivity[7]althoughMilleretal.[8] foundthatthe presence
of a promoter in the catalyst was the only parameter, which

hypotheses were proposed to explain it [9–11]. The most
relevant explanation seems to be that the catalytic centers are
made of sulfur vacancies at the edges of MoS2 or WS2
particles where Mo or W atoms are substituted for promoter
atomsinsuchawaythatthestrengthofthe metal–sulfurbonds
is weakened down to the optimum required for the HDS
activity [9,10]. However, the promotion effect also exists for
the hydrogenation of oleﬁns [12–15]. Then, one could wonder
if, as certain results in the literature would suggest, the
optimum in synergy for HDS and oleﬁn hydrogenation could
occur for different concentrations in promoter [13,14] or if the
effect could be different in magnitude for the two reactions
[15]. In fact, several studies showed that the cobalt promoter
enhanced the HDS activity (for thiophene, for instance) more
than the oleﬁn hydrogenation activity ([7] and references
therein). In connection with this, it was found [16] that Ni had
no effect on the isotopic exchange between H2 and D2 (i. e. on
the dissociation of H2) while Co had quite a signiﬁcant effect,
which is in accordance with other ﬁndings [17–19].
According to recent theoretical studies [20,21], this could
be attributed to the fact that cobalt increases the ability of
sulfuratomstobindprotonsbecause the sulfuratomsboundto
cobalt are more basic than sulfur atoms in non-promoted Mo
sulﬁde. On the other hand, sulfur bound to Ni on a Ni-
promoted edge is considered as unstable so that no S–Ni pairs
are available to dissociate H2. The idea then is that the
promotion effect of Co and Ni in the hydrogenation of oleﬁns
could also be different as certain results in the literature seem
also to indicate [15]. Therefore, one of the objectives of this
work was to verify the effect of both Co and Ni on the activity
of Mo sulﬁde in the hydrogenation of oleﬁns (cyclopentene
andpropene)inthe hopeofbringingnewinsightinthe process
of oleﬁn hydrogenation on sulﬁdes in general.
The other objective of the work was related to the
fundamental aspects of the hydrogenation of oleﬁns on
sulﬁde catalysts. More speciﬁcally, the aim of the study was
also to examine the possible involvement of ‘‘heterolytic’’
hydrogen in oleﬁn hydrogenation. Actually, previous studies
in our laboratory [22–24] brought corroborating elements in
favour of the heterolytic dissociation of H2 on sulﬁdes. For
instance, it was shown that an exchange of H and D atoms
between H2 and D2S occurred on sulﬁded alumina-
supported hydrotreating catalysts [22]. Similar results were
obtained by Hensen et al. [18] on carbon-supported catalysts
and by Barbour and Campbell in older experiments carried
out on unsupported molybdenum sulﬁde [25]. Hence, it was
concluded that both reactants dissociated in the same
manner on the same kind of catalytic centers, and since it is
generally accepted that the dissociation of H2S (D2S) on
sulﬁdes is heterolytic [26–34], it was assumed that the
dissociation of hydrogen also was heterolytic. This is in
accordance with theoretical calculations [20,26] as well as
with proposals made on the basis of molecular modelling
[35], kinetic modelling [36–38] or mechanistic considera-
tions [39]. In such a process, the dissociation of H2 on a
catalytic center composed of a sulfur vacancy located on a
molybdenum atom and of a neighbouring sulfur anion leads
to the H-atom having a hydride character adsorbed on the
metal ion and the H-atom with a protonic character
adsorbed on the sulfur anion [27,36,40,41]. By carrying out
H2–D2 exchange experiments on a H2/H2S presulﬁded
NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst or by reacting D2 on such a catalyst
sample, it was also shown through isotopic dilution, that
gaseous D2 could incorporate H-atoms coming from the
support [16,22,23]. On a typical commercial catalyst, the
amount of support hydrogen which could be incorporated
into the deuterium of the gas phase varied depending on the
pretreating conditions and could be as high as 90% of the
hydrogen held by the solid after sulﬁdation. It was also
shown that the latter resulted mostly from the adsorption of
H2S [16]. Since the H atoms of the hydroxyl groups of the
alumina support have undoubtedly an ionic character, this
was also considered good evidence in favour of the
heterolytic splitting of D2 (H2). FTIR studies conﬁrmed
that hydrogen from the gas phase could be exchanged with
the hydrogen atoms of the hydroxyl groups of the support
via the sulﬁde phase [16,23]. In order to see if ‘‘ionic’’
hydrogen could be involved in the hydrogenation of oleﬁns,
we carried out experiments in which propene was
hydrogenated
on
catalyst
samples
which
had
been
pretreated with D2S. Experiments were carried out on
both promoted and non-promoted MoS2 in order to see if
the promoter could have an effect on the process.
2. Experimental
Two types of reactors (and corresponding reaction
conditions) were used: (i) a ﬁxed bed reactor in which
the hydrogenation of cyclopentene was carried out and (ii) a
closed recycling reactor with a limited volume which made
it possible to detect the participation in the reaction of the
hydrogen held by the solids.
2.1. Catalysts
A series of laboratory-made CoMo/Al2O3 and NiMo/
Al2O3 catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation
were used for the hydrogenation of cyclopentene. Their
preparation and characteristics were given elsewhere [42].
Their chemical composition as well as the main character-
istics of the Mo/Al2O3 catalyst used for the hydrogenation of
propene and of the commercial catalysts used for the
hydrogenation of both oleﬁns are reported in Table 1.
The catalysts were presulﬁded in situ with a ﬂow of H2
(90%) and H2S (10%) at 400 8C under atmospheric pressure
for 15 h.
2.2. Hydrogenation of cyclopentene
After sulﬁdation, the catalyst samples were treated under
helium at 350 8C for 1 h. The hydrogenation of cyclopentene

in solution in n-heptane (15.6 mol.%) was carried out in a
ﬁxed-bed reactor at 150 8C under atmospheric pressure. The
H2/hydrocarbon molar ratio was equal to 36. The molar ﬂow
rate of cyclopentene was equal to 0.34 mmol h1 for the Mo
and CoMo catalysts and to 1.14 mmol h1 for the NiMo
catalyst while the amount of catalyst was, respectively, 300
and 100 mg. The activity of each sample was measured after
stabilization (2–3 h on stream) at conversion rates, which
were below 10%.
2.3. Hydrogenation of propene
The hydrogenation of propene was carried out at 80 8C in
a 72 cm3 recycling reactor.
After sulﬁdation, and before the hydrogenation reaction,
the catalyst samples (250 mg, generally) were treated for 1 h
at 350 8C in a ﬂow of dry helium and cooled down to 80 8C
under helium. The reactants (H2 plus propene; 0.5 bar of
each, 12.4  104 mol) were then introduced into the
reactor (so that the total pressure was equal to 2 bar) and the
recycling pump was started. The initial rate of the reaction
was obtained from the slope of the curve representing the
formation of propane versus reaction time.
For the experiments with preadsorbed D2S, the latter was
introduced in the closed reactor and recycled at 80 8C
(0.5 bar with 1.5 bar of He) for 1 h. The catalysts were then
treated under a ﬂow of helium at various temperatures for 1 h
and cooled down to 80 8C. A treatment under a ﬂow of argon
at 80 8C for 1 h was necessary to remove the helium, which
has the same molecular weight as D2. Then H2 and propene
were introduced.
The equipment which was described elsewhere [22], was
ﬁtted with a gas chromatograph equipped with a FID
detector for the analysis of the mixture of propene and
propane and with a mass spectrometer in order to analyse
H2, HD, D2, propene and propane, deuterated or not.
3. Results
3.1. Hydrogenation of cyclopentene
As shown in Fig. 1, a maximum in activity was obtained
with a promoter/(promoter + molybdenum) atomic ratio of
about 0.3. However, the promotion effect of Ni (about nine at
the optimum) was much more signiﬁcant than that of Co
(about two only). This was not so for the hydrodesulfuriza-
tion of dibenzothiophene carried out on the same series of
catalysts: both had approximately the same activity in that
case [42]. We may also notice that the commercial NiMo and
CoMo catalysts had approximately the same activity in the
hydrogenation of cyclopentene as the corresponding home-
made catalysts.
3.2. Hydrogenation of propene
3.2.1. Effect of the promoters on the activity of the
presulﬁded catalysts
As indicated in the experimental part, the hydrogenation
of propene was carried out at 80 8C in a recycling reactor
after treatment of the sulﬁded catalysts under helium at
350 8C for 1 h. As can be seen in Table 2, the activity of the
NiMo catalyst was again much higher than that of the CoMo
catalyst, which was hardly more active than the non-
promoted Mo catalyst.
3.2.2. Reaction on D2S-treated presulﬁded samples
As indicated in Section 2, the reaction was carried out in a
recycling reactor containing 1.24 mmol of propene and of
H2 under the standard reaction conditions. In order to be able
to detect the incorporation of D-atoms in propane at low
conversion, we had to choose the size of the reactor so that
the volume of propene reactant in the gas phase was as small
as possible compared to the amount of D2S preadsorbed on

the catalyst. It was also necessary to ﬁnd a compromise
between the fact that H2S (D2S) inhibited the reaction very
much under the chosen reaction conditions [43] and the fact
that a maximum of preadsobed D2S was necessary to make it
possible to detect D-atoms among the products. Moreover,
most of the preadsorbed H (D) was found to be located on
the support [16,23]. Therefore, the extent of incorporation of
D-atoms in propane depended also very much on the rate of
transfer of the D-atoms from the support to the sulﬁde phase
which was much lower than the rate of the direct dissociation
of H2 on the sulﬁde phase. For instance, it was found that the
rate of formation of HD obtained by contacting H2 at 80 8C
with a presulﬁded NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst which had been
pretreated with D2S, then with helium at the reaction
temperature was 4.4 times lower than the rate of dissociation
of H2 (actually the rate of formation of HD resulting from the
isotopic exchange between H2 and D2) under the same
conditions over a presulﬁded sample treated under helium at
the reaction temperature [22].
As shown previously [16,22], the amount of preadsorbed
H on NiMo/Al2O3 after presulﬁdation and treatment under
helium at 80 8C (the reaction temperature for H2–D2 isotopic
exchange experiments and propene hydrogenation) was
about 2.4 mmol g1, which in principle was enough to be
detected. However, under these conditions, the hydrogena-
tion of propene did not occur. On the other hand, preliminary
experiments carried out with the same catalyst showed also
that after treatment under helium at 350 8C, the amount of
available D-atoms on the catalyst resulting from the
preadsorption of D2S was obviously too low to obtain
reliable D-distribution in the products and the reaction was
too fast to obtain reproducible data at low conversion.
Finally, it appeared that a good compromise was obtained
after treatment of the D2S-exposed samples under helium at
200 8C. Under these conditions the amount of exchangeable
preadsorbed D-atoms over 250 mg of the NiMo catalyst
could be estimated at a maximum of about 0.45 mmol
(1.8 mmol g1) [16].
3.2.2.1. Activity. Table 3 shows the inﬂuence of the Co and
Ni promoters on the initial rate of hydrogenation of propene
over the presulﬁded samples which were treated with D2S at
80 8C, then with helium at 200 8C. As can be seen in the
table, the activity was lower than the activity obtained after
treatment under helium at 350 8C because of the inhibiting
effect of adsorbed D2S, which was more signiﬁcant.
However, the results conﬁrm that the promotion effect of
Ni was higher than that of Co.
3.2.2.2. Deuterium incorporation and distribution in pro-
pane and in dihydrogen. As shown in Table 3, D-atoms did
incorporate in gas phase hydrogen, which was expected
[22,23] and also in propane via propene hydrogenation.
Considering, for instance that the amount of exchangeable
D-atoms present on the NiMo catalyst after treatment with
D2S at 80 8C, then under helium at 200 8C was of about
1.8 mmol g1, the amount of D-atoms incorporated into the
products after 2 h of reaction represents approximately 25%
of this available amount.
Fig. 2 shows the D-distribution in propane and in gas phase
dihydrogen versus propene conversion. Small quantities of
deuterium were incorporated in propane and in dihydrogen.
However, its distribution versus conversion was not the same
with all the catalysts. Whatever the conversion in hydro-
genation the deuterium distribution in propane and in
dihydrogen was the same with the CoMo catalyst whereas
at low conversion, the distribution was different with the Mo
and particularly with the NiMo catalyst.
4. Discussion
4.1. Promotion effect
In relation with the fundamental aspects of the HDS of
thiophenic compounds and in connection with the more
recent concern regarding the practical aspects of the HDS
of FCC gasoline, the question of whether the hydrogena-
tion of oleﬁns and HDS (or C–S bond cleavage) occur on
the same catalytic centers or not has been the subject of a
large
debate
in
the
literature
[7,44–51].
Actually,
according to Miller et al., the presence of a promoter
in the catalyst is the only parameter, which has an effect

on the HDS/hydrogenation selectivity of FCC gasoline
[8].
The fact that the optimum in oleﬁn hydrogenation activity
occurred for the same value of the promoter/(promoter +
molybdenum) atomic ratio as the one generally reported for
HDS [10] militates in favour of a single type of catalytic
centers for the two reactions. The fact that the magnitude of
the promotion effect in hydrogenation of the oleﬁns was
much less signiﬁcant than, for instance, in the HDS of
dibenzothiophene
[42]
is
not
contradictory
with
the
hypothesis of a single type of site. It is generally accepted
[52–54] that the promoter modiﬁes the electron density on
the molybdenum and the basicity of the neighbouring sulfur
atoms. Consequently, it can change the adsorption strength
of the reactants. However, the adsorption strength depends
also on the nature of the reactant and there is no reason for
the effect to be the same in magnitude for two different
reactants. Moreover, the promotion effect on two different
reactions can also depend on various other factors even if
both reactions occur on the same sites made of a
coordinatively unsaturated center associated with a neigh-
bouring sulfur anion [27,36,38,40,41]. It can indeed depend
on the nature of the rate-limiting step, which may not be of
the same nature for both reactions; for instance, the addition
of a hydrogen species for the hydrogenation of oleﬁns and
the C–S bond cleavage for HDS. Then, depending on the
reaction mechanisms, the catalytic center may not be
involved in the same manner in the reactions. For instance,
sulfur anions may take part directly in C–S bond cleavage if
it occurs through a b-elimination process or they may be
involved simply as SH groups providing hydrogen in the
case of oleﬁn hydrogenation and again the effect can of
course be different in magnitude.
An interesting point is that the promotion effects of Co
and Ni in the hydrogenation of oleﬁns were quite different in
magnitude while they were similar in HDS [42]. This
conﬁrms previous results by Candia et al. [15], which
indicated that the promotion effect of Ni on the hydro-
genation of butene formed during the HDS of thiophene was
more signiﬁcant than the effect of Co. Indeed, the fact that
Co has a more limited effect than Ni in this reaction explains
why in practice CoMo catalysts are more efﬁcient than
NiMo catalysts in the selective HDS of FCC gasoline.
However, this result is rather difﬁcult to explain. The
difference in promotion effects cannot be due to the
activation of H2 since the opposite was obtained in the latter:
the promotion effect of Co was greater than that of Ni in the
isotopic exchange between H2 and D2 [16–19]. Actually, the
explanation given by Travert et al. [20], then by Sun et al.
[21], was that cobalt increases the ability of sulfur atoms to
bind protons because the sulfur atoms bound to cobalt are
more basic than sulfur atoms in non-promoted Mo sulﬁde.
Consequently, if it is assumed that the rate-limiting step of
the exchange is the dissociation of H2 or D2, the reaction is
expected to be faster on CoMo than on Mo catalysts. On the
other hand, sulfur bound to Ni on a Ni-promoted edge is
considered as unstable so that no S–Ni pairs are available to
dissociate H2 (although dissociation may occur at bridging S
atoms) and hence no or a very limited promotion effect is
observed. Now, to explain the promotion effects in the
hydrogenation of oleﬁns, we have to consider other
hypotheses. It has been reported that the hydrogenation of
aromatics on sulﬁdes involved ‘‘heterolytically’’ dissociated
hydrogen and that the rate-limiting step of the reaction was
the addition of a proton to the adsorbed substrate having
undergone ﬁrst the addition of a hydride species [36,38]. If it
was also the case for oleﬁn hydrogenation, then Co should
decrease the rate since the SH groups are expected to be less
acidic than on the unpromoted catalyst. However, this effect
can be compensated to a large extent by the increase of the
number of catalytic centers [55] so that the CoMo catalyst is

slightly more active than the unpromoted catalyst. The more
signiﬁcant effect of Ni seems to be more complex. It can also
increase the number of catalytic centers and, in line with the
proposal of Travert et al. [20], it can also be supposed that
the hydrogen species adsorbed on the NiMo catalyst are so
unstable that they are very easily captured by any basic
substrate such as an adsorbed oleﬁn.
4.2. Involvement of ‘‘heterolytic hydrogen’’ in the
hydrogenation reaction
The results reported in Table 3 show that D-atoms from
preadsorbed D2S do incorporate into propane produced
through propene hydrogenation. Indeed, we veriﬁed that
under the experimental conditions no exchange was
occurring between D2 and propane. However, the incorpora-
tion of D-atoms into propane could result from the H–D
exchange between gas phase hydrogen and D2S giving HD
through a heterolytic process followed by the addition of the
latter to propene through a different mechanism (e.g.
homolytic). Then, the question is whether D-atoms from
D2S were added to propene directly or not. If we assume that
the dissociation of the H2 and D2S reactants is heterolytic,
D2S provides only D+ (together with SD) while H2
provides both H+ and H. Consequently, propane can result
initially from the addition of H (equation (1)) followed
either (i) by the addition of D+ (equation (2)), which leads to
d1-propane or (ii) by the addition of H+ (equation (3)), which
leads to non-deuterated propane:

(3)
Since D2S was preadsorbed on the catalyst, it can be
expected that at the early stage of the reaction the
concentration of D+ on the surface was very high. Therefore,
if under these conditions H–D scrambling in hydrogen is not
complete, the concentration of the mono-deuterated species
in propane resulting from the sequence represented in
equations (1) and (2) should be higher than the concentration
of HD in dihydrogen. In fact, the gap should be all the more
signiﬁcant as the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst is
more important compared to its activity in H/D exchange
between H2 and D2. So the idea was to look at the isotope
distribution in the products at low hydrogenation conversion.
Fig. 2c shows that with the NiMo catalyst, at conversions
lower than about 10%, the percentage of the d1-species in
propane was clearly higher than the percentage of HD in
dihydrogen. As indicated in the foregoing, this is in favour of
the direct addition of D-atoms (D+) from D2S to propene. At
higher conversions, the D-distribution in propane and in
hydrogen becomes very close because of H–D scrambling
between H2 andD2S.Moreover, it was found that the presence
of dihydrogen in the gas phase was absolutely necessary for
the reaction to occur. The same observation was made by
Barbour and Campbell [25] who carried out similar
experiments with buta-1,3-diene. They concluded that
hydrogen was necessary to replenish the SH groups which
were involved in the hydrogenation reaction. If we assume
that the dissociation of H2 is heterolytic, an alternative
explanation which we propose is that adsorbed D2S can only
afford D+ and that H2 is absolutely necessary to provide H.
With the Mo catalyst, the results were similar to those
obtained with the NiMo catalyst although the phenomenon
was less signiﬁcant and was only detectable at very low
conversion (less than 2–3%; Fig. 2a). With the CoMo catalyst,
however, the isotopic scrambling between H2 and D2S was
apparently so fast that no difference in D-distribution was
detectable even at very low conversion (Fig. 2b). As can be
seen in Table 2, the difference in isotopic distribution at low
conversion is completely consistent with the values of the
ratio between the activities in hydrogenation and isotopic
exchange of the catalysts which decrease in the order:
NiMo > Mo > CoMo
It can, therefore, be concluded that ‘‘heterolytic hydro-
gen’’ contributes to the hydrogenation reaction over sulﬁdes.
5. Conclusion
Our results conﬁrm that the promotion of Ni in the
hydrogenation of oleﬁns is higher than that of Co. Its
optimum appears for the same value of the promoter/
(promoter + molybdenum) atomic ratio as for HDS and
although its magnitude is lower than that for the latter, this
militates in favour of a single type of sites for both reactions.
On the other hand, this explains why CoMo catalysts are
generally considered as more efﬁcient than NiMo catalysts
in the selective HDS of FCC gasoline.
The comparison of the initial product distributions in
propane resulting from the hydrogenation of propene on the
D2S-treated catalysts and in gas phase hydrogen indicates
that D-atoms issuing from D2S were added to propene
directly, which means that hydrogen atoms resulting from
the heterolytic dissociation of dihydrogen participate in the
reaction.
The fact that gaseous hydrogen was necessary for the
reaction to occur is considered further evidence in favour of
the heterolytic dissociation of H2 on sulﬁdes.
