A novel hollow ﬁber catalytic membrane reactor for oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH) was fabricated
by integrating BaBi0.05Co0.8Nb0.15O3-δ (BBCN) perovskite hollow ﬁber membrane with silica-supported isolated
Co2+ catalyst. Two other modes of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) were studied for comparison, non-oxidative
dehydrogenation (NPDH), and conventional OPDH reaction via co-feed method. The results showed excellent
performance of the catalytic membrane reactor, with C3H6 yield of ~ 50% and C3H6 selectivity of ~ 74% ob-
tained at 650 °C over a 50-h long-term stability test, which are signiﬁcantly higher than values obtained in the
other two conventional reaction modes. Currently, this BBCN catalytic membrane reactor showed the highest
C3H6 yield and best long-term stability as compared to other perovskite membrane reactors reported in litera-
ture. Propane feeding rate should be adjusted to match the oxygen permeation through the membrane thus
maintaining the optimum ratio between propane to oxygen; excess oxygen permeation leads to combustion of
propylene product and loss of propylene selectivity, while low oxygen permeation leads to low propane con-
version. High temperature favors oxygen permeation through perovskite membranes but also increases the
probability of cracking reaction. Therefore, if there is enough oxygen permeation through the membrane, it is
preferred to operate this reaction at a lower temperature to increase the selectivity of propylene.
1. Introduction
Propylene is an essential chemical intermediate for production of
more valuable chemical products (mainly polypropylene). Catalytic
propane dehydrogenation is an increasingly popular process which can
be used to produce propylene [1]. Catoﬁn (CrOx based catalyst) and
Oleﬂex (Pt-Sn based catalyst) are most used commercialized dehy-
drogenation processes for propane dehydrogenation. Both the processes
show good selectivity of > 85% with once-through conversion of
~ 40% [2]. However, there are several problems limiting the propylene
production via PDH: (1) PDH reaction is limited by thermodynamic
equilibrium; (2) PDH reaction is a highly endothermic reaction (Reac-
tion (1′)) requiring a large amount of energy; (3) the activity of the
commercial catalysts show rapid deactivation due to the severe coke
deposition on the catalysts surface. Hence, the commercial catalysts
require frequent regeneration step within a short interval of time
(10–30 mins) [2,3].
C3H8↔C3H6+H2, ΔH(298k)=+124 kJ/mol
(1′)
C3H8+1/2O2→C3H6+H2O, ΔH(298k)=-117 kJ/mol
(2′)
Oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH) is a promising alter-
native for propylene production which can help to alleviate the lim-
itations of PDH. The combination of exothermic OPDH reaction with
endothermic PDH reaction helps to overcome the thermodynamic
limitations of PDH, and to reduce the problem of catalyst coking
thereby prevents deactivation of the catalyst. Generally, steam, CO2 and
O2 are used as oxidants, with oxygen being the most eﬃcient oxidant.
However, as oleﬁns (C3H6) are more active than alkanes (C3H8), oxygen
will also further oxidize the desired products to COx [4]. Hence, the
selectivity of propylene via OPDH reaction with O2 as oxidant is much
lower than that via PDH reaction.
Oxygen permeable perovskite membrane reactors have shown no-
teworthy advantages to overcome aforementioned shortcomings of
OPDH reaction [5–7]. Firstly, oxygen permeable perovskite membranes
show distinctive oxygen permeability via oxygen ion conduction, oﬀer
100% theoretical O2 selectivity through the membrane [8–12]. The
catalytic perovskite membrane reactor integrates oxygen separation
with reaction in one unit, synergistically enhances both membrane
permeability and catalytic activity, resulting in process intensiﬁcation
[13–15]. Recently, our group developed BBCN perovskite hollow ﬁber
membranes with excellent oxygen permeability [16–18]. Oxygen

permeation through BBCN membranes can be observed at as low as
600 °C, matching the required temperature for PDH reaction [19–21].
The conﬁguration of hollow ﬁber membranes also provides the ad-
vantage of having a signiﬁcantly higher ratio of membrane surface area
per reactor volume when compared to disk or tubular membranes
[22–32]. Moreover, oxygen can be uniformly distributed along the
hollow ﬁber membrane to the catalyst bed resulting in improved pro-
pylene selectivity.
Despite the promising beneﬁts oxygen permeable perovskite mem-
brane reactors can oﬀer, few studies have investigated OPDH reaction
via oxygen permeable perovskite membrane reactors [6,7,33,34]. To
date, the best reported performance was obtained in a multistep per-
meating hollow ﬁber membrane reactor, with a maximum propylene
yield of 36%, and selectivity of 48% at 675 °C [33]. However, this
performance is still insuﬃcient for industrial applications. Furthermore,
none of the studies investigated the long-term stability of their per-
ovskite membranes. In this work, BBCN hollow ﬁber membrane was
integrated with silica-supported isolated Co2+ catalyst to fabricate a
novel catalytic BBCN hollow ﬁber membrane reactor to investigate
OPDH reaction (Fig. 1). The results show excellent performance with
C3H6 yield of 46–51% and C3H6 selectivity of 68–74% obtained at
650 °C, as well as excellent (50 h) long-term stability of the membranes.
So far, this BBCN catalytic membrane reactor showed the highest C3H6
yield and best long-term stability as compared to other perovskite
membrane reactors reported in literature.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of BBCN hollow ﬁber membrane and Co (II) ions catalysts
The synthesis of BaBi0.05Co0.8Nb0.15O3-δ (BBCN) perovskite powders
and the fabrication of BBCN hollow ﬁber membrane precursor can be
found in our previous work [16,17]. Ceramic BBCN hollow ﬁber
membranes were obtained by sintering the membrane precursor at
1175 °C for 5 h. Silica-supported isolated Co2+ catalyst was synthesized
via surface organometallic grafting (SOG) method with 5 wt% cobalt
doping ratio, the details can be found in the literature [35].
2.2. Catalytic hollow ﬁber membrane reactor and PDH reaction
The performance of PDH reaction via the three catalytic reactor
types were tested and measured as shown in Fig. 2. Reactor (a) (R (a)):
conventional packed bed reactor for non-oxidative propane dehy-
drogenation (NPDH) as shown in Fig. 2(a); Reactor (b) (R (b)): con-
ventional packed bed reactor with propane and O2 co-feed mode for
oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH) as shown in Fig. 2(b);
Reactor (c) (R (c)): catalytic BBCN hollow ﬁber membrane reactor for
OPDH reaction as shown in Fig. 2(c). Catalyst was packed around the
middle section of BBCN hollow ﬁber membrane and ﬁxed by quartz
wool, giving an eﬀective membrane area of around 1 cm2. This mem-
brane reactor was then placed in a tubular furnace to control the
temperature. The catalyst for R (a), R (b) and R (c) is silica-supported
isolated Co2+ from the same synthesis batch, with the same catalyst
loading of 0.5 g in each reactor. 10 ml/min of 10% propane feed was
used for all three reactors by using pure propane feed rate of 1 ml/min
mixed with a pure He feed rate of 9 ml/min. For the catalytic hollow
ﬁber membrane reactor, propane was fed on the shell side of the hollow
ﬁber membrane, and air was introduced into the lumen side of the
hollow ﬁber membrane with ﬂow rate of 200 ml/min. The ﬂow rate of
all inlet gases (C3H6, He and Air) were controlled using mass ﬂow
controllers (Brooks 5850E). Both inlet and outlet gas ﬂow rates were
also measured using a bubble ﬂow meter. OPDH reaction via the cat-
alytic membrane reactor was initiated at 600 °C with the reactor tem-
perature slowly ramped up to 700 °C. All reaction products were passed
through a condenser held at 5 °C to condense any moisture before being
injected to a Gas Chromatography (GC) system equipped with a thermal
conductivity (TCD) detector. Propane conversion (X), product se-
lectivity (S), and propylene product yield (Y ) are deﬁned as follows:

2.3. Characterization
The crystal phase structures of fresh and spent membranes after
reaction were determined by X-ray diﬀraction (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-
6000 power diﬀract meter) using Cu K-α radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å).
Continuous scan mode was used to collect 2θ data from 20° to 80° at
room temperature. Speciﬁc surface area of this catalyst was also de-
termined via nitrogen physical adsorption at 77 K with a Micromeritics
ASAP 2020 system, using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.
The speciﬁc area of the silica-supported isolated Co2+ catalyst was
measured to be about 1026 m2/g. Carbon residue on the spent catalyst
after PDH reaction was measured via thermo-gravimetric analysis
(TGA). Around 10 mg spent catalyst was used for TGA analysis and
heated in static air while the temperature was increased to 900 °C at a
ramping rate of 10 °C/min. Surface morphology and element compo-
sition for fresh and spent membranes were measured using a Scanning
Electron Microscope coupled with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy
(SEM-EDX, JEOL, JSM-6701F). The samples were degassed under va-
cuum condition to remove impurities. Platinum coating (about10nm
thickness) was carried out at 20 mA for 60 s to increase the electron
conductivity for SEM-EDX. UV–visible absorption spectroscopy mea-
surements for the fresh and spent catalysts were also carried out on a
Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer using barium sulfate as a reference.
3. Results and discussion
The performances of all three types of reactors are shown in Fig. 3.
As shown in Fig. 3(c), the novel catalytic membrane reactor (R (c))
showed excellent performance, with C3H6 yield of 46–51%, C3H8 con-
version of 62–75%, and C3H6 selectivity of 68–74% achieved at 650 °C
in the long-term (50 h) stability test. In contrast, it can be seen from
Fig. 3(a) that the reaction mode R (a) showed initial C3H8 conversion
increases to 70% in 6 h duration, and then sharply decreases to 24%
after 50 h duration, corresponding to a 66% loss in activity. Meanwhile,
C3H6 selectivity was observed to drop from 81% to 67% in the same
time-period. This phenomenon is attributed to the coke deposition on
the catalyst surface during PDH reaction, which will be illustrated using
TGA analysis. In reaction mode R (b), using the co-feed mode for OPDH
reaction, the ﬂow rate of oxygen introduced was same as the total
oxygen permeation through BBCN hollow ﬁber membrane in R (c),
which is around 0.4–0.5 ml/min. As apparent in Fig. 3(b), the OPDH
reaction in co-feed mode showed a stable performance over 50 h. C3H8
conversion was around 52% and 48% while C3H6 selectivity is around
39% and 46% when the ﬂowrate of O2 was at 0.5 and 0.4 ml/min re-
spectively. Generally, OPDH reaction delivers higher conversion and
lower selectivity compared to non-oxidative PDH (NPDH) reaction.
However, the C3H8 conversion from R (b) was less than that from R (a).
This could be due to the Co (II) ions getting partially oxidized to cat-
alytically inactive Co (III) ions which do not have catalytic activity for
PDH reaction [36–38]. Oxygen could not be distributed uniformly in
the catalyst bed in the co-feed mode for OPDH reaction, with oxygen
concentration at the inlet expected to be higher than that at the outlet
as it gets consumed by the reaction. After reaction, the color of the
catalyst bed was not uniform and showed a color gradient from light
gray near the inlet to black near the exit of the catalyst bed. Hence, it
can be inferred that the inlet part of the catalyst bed might be oxidized
to Co (III) under a comparably higher oxygen concentration. In con-
trast, oxygen was distributed uniformly along the catalytic hollow ﬁber
membrane reactor resulting in a lower oxygen concentration, which
prevents further oxidation of Co (II) ions. This conclusion will be fur-
ther illustrated using UV–vis spectrophotometric analysis.
The selectivity of side products from the three reactor types are
shown in Fig. 4. In all three types of catalytic reactors, C2H4, C2H6 and
CH4 were found to be side products which are attributed to thermal
cracking reaction. It also can be found from Fig. 4(b) and (c) that CO
and CO2 were produced from R (b) and R (c) due to combustion

reaction. Regarding NPDH reaction, it can be seen from Fig. 4(a) that all
side products increased with time. Due to coke deposition on the sur-
face of the catalyst, active sites are blocked leading to the weaker ad-
sorption of propane, and there is a possibility for thermal cracking
being prominent in the absence of availability of active sites at 650 °C.
In OPDH reaction (R (b)), it can be seen from Fig. 4(b) that CO se-
lectivity was around 16% and 12%, while CO2 selectivity was around
10% and 8% under the two diﬀerent oxygen feed rates. In contrast, it
can be seen from Fig. 4(c) that CO and CO2 selectivity was around 4–6%
in R (c). This shows that COx side products from deep combustion can
be eﬀectively inhibited using the catalytic hollow ﬁber membrane re-
actor over the oxygen co-feed reactor.
It is well known that oxygen permeation through perovskite mem-
brane increases with increasing temperature. For OPDH reaction, low
oxygen permeation will be insuﬃcient in improving reaction activity
while excess oxygen permeation will lead to combustion of desirable
products to undesirable side products (COx). Hence, appropriate oxygen
permeation is required to match propane feeding rate. As seen from
Fig. 5, low conversion and high selectivity can be obtained at 600 °C. At
this temperature, the oxygen permeation through BBCN membrane was
very low, which suggests that most of the reaction happening was the
NPDH reaction. On the other hand, high conversion but low selectivity
was obtained at 700 °C. At this temperature, excess of oxygen leads to
formation of undesirable combustion products, and the high tempera-
tures also leads to severe propane cracking [36–38]. Both high con-
version and high selectivity was achieved at 650 °C. At this tempera-
ture, the oxygen permeation was optimal for OPDH reaction, trading oﬀ
some selectivity for an increase in conversion. Moreover, the catalytic
activity of the catalyst was also maintained due to the removal of
carbon residue on the catalyst by permeated oxygen.
In addition, 2–4% H2 can be detected in the products of OPDH re-
action via BBCN catalytic hollow ﬁber membrane reactor. This suggests
that both the true OPDH reaction (Reaction (2)), NPDH reaction (Re-
action (1)), as well as combustion are happening at the same time [1].
Even though increasing oxygen permeation could enhance the con-
version of propane and the stability of the catalyst, the loss of propene
selectivity may make the process uneconomical. Hence, oxygen

permeation in this catalytic membrane reactor should be carefully
controlled to ensure an optimum trade-oﬀbetween propene selectivity
and propane conversion.
The spent catalysts of three type catalytic reactors show diﬀerent
color after reaction as shown in Fig. 2. The spent catalyst after long-
term NPDH reaction in R (a) shows a uniform black color; the one after
long-term conventional OPDH reaction in R (b) shows a color gradient
from light gray (inlet part of the catalyst bed) to black (outlet part of the
catalyst bed); the one after long-term OPDH reaction via the novel
catalytic membrane reactor R (c) shows a uniform gray color. To
measure the carbon residue on the catalyst, all spent catalysts were
analyzed by TGA. Spent catalyst near the inlet and outlet sections of
reactor R (b) were individually collected for TGA analysis. The results
are shown in Fig. 6. It was observed that R (a) experiences the most
weight loss of almost 50%. This severe weight loss suggests that a large
amount of carbon was deposited on the spent catalyst after long-term
NPDH reaction, which could explain why the conversion sharply de-
creased after 6 h of reaction. The carbon residue can be inhibited via
catalytic oxygen permeable membrane reactor R (c), as seen from the
reduced weight lost to around 20%. Further increase of oxygen per-
meation could further prevent the formation carbon residue, but at the
cost of selectivity, as shown in Fig. 5. Spent catalyst extracted from R
(b) at the inlet and outlet part of the catalyst bed show diﬀerent weight
loss, with 3.2% weight loss in the inlet part and 32% weight loss in the
outlet part. This result was consistent with the explanation from Fig. 3
that oxygen concentration decreases as it passes through the catalyst
bed due to it being consumed as the reactant gases travel down the
reactor.
The micro-morphology and elemental composition of fresh and
spent membranes were detected by SEM-EDX analysis. It can be seen
from Fig. 7(a) that the SEM image of fresh membrane showed free from
voids or other defects was formed - all ceramic grains were interlinked
with clear grain boundaries visible. After the reaction, on the outer
surface of spent membrane, the boundaries of ceramic grains became
indistinctive as shown in Fig. 7(b). Comparison with EDX spectrums of
the fresh membrane with that of spent membrane, a large amount of
carbon element are shown on the spent membrane after long-term
reaction, which could be attributed to some carbon residue on the
surface of spent membrane. It also can be observed from EDX spectrums
that barium element was enriched on the spent membrane after long-
term reaction which could be attributed to the formation of barium
carbonate as barium in the perovskite membrane reacts with CO2
produced from OPDH reaction. Similar ﬁndings were reported in our
previous work for other reactions via catalytic reactors [14,15]. How-
ever, the change only happened on the surface of the membrane, the
bulk of membrane was still intact as shown in Fig. 8. XRD analysis of
the spent membrane showed the same XRD patterns as the fresh
membrane, showing cubic perovskite phase structure without any im-
purity phase. This result conﬁrms that the membrane remains intact
even after long-term reaction.
The UV–vis spectra of both fresh and spent catalysts in the reaction
mode R (b) are shown in Fig. 9. The UV–vis spectra for both samples
exhibit three absorption peaks at around 525, 590 and 640 nm, which
can be assigned to the 4A2(F) →4T1(P) transition of Co (II) ions in tet-
rahedral structure [39,40]. However, one broad peak can be found on
the UV–vis spectra of spent catalysts after reaction in R(b), which can
be assigned to the charge transfer from O (II) to Co (III) in
Co3O4[41,42]. This suggests that the isolated Co (II) ions are partially
oxidized to Co (III) ions which are catalytically inactive in the PDH
reaction. This also explains the decrease of propane conversion after gas
phase oxygen was introduced into the packed bed catalytic reactor. Pre-
mixed propane and gas phase oxygen leads to an oxygen concentration
gradient along the catalyst bed, and the initial high oxygen con-
centration leads to the oxidization of functional Co (II) ions near the
reactor inlet. In contrast, oxygen can be uniformly distributed along the
catalytic hollow ﬁber membrane reactor, which allows for controlled
introduction of oxygen into the PDH reaction to prevent undesirable
combustion of products and oxidation of catalysts.
The performance of BBCN catalytic hollow ﬁber membrane reactor
was compared with that of other perovskite membrane reactors re-
ported in literature for OPDH reaction, the comparison of performances
was summarized in Table 1. The catalytic BBCN membrane reactor
shown in this work has a better performance than any other reactor
reported in literature, both in selectivity and yield. In addition, our
study is the ﬁrst study to carry out a long-term stability test and showed
a stable performance of the hollow ﬁber membrane reactor during a
50 h test for OPDH reaction.
4. Conclusions
The catalytic BBCN perovskite hollow ﬁber membrane reactor was
investigated for OPDH reaction. The results show that high C3H6 yield
(~ 50%) and selectivity (~ 74%) can be achieved from the catalytic
membrane reactor, which was more than twice the yield and selectivity
that was obtained from the conventional co-feed mode reactor. In ad-
dition, the catalytic membrane reactor shows a good stability over 50 h,
a marked improvement over conventional packed bed reactor for NPDH
reaction. To achieve the optimum performance via this catalytic per-
ovskite hollow ﬁber membrane reactor for OPDH reaction, it is im-
portant to maintain the proper propane feed to oxygen permeation
ratio. If oxygen permeation is suﬃcient, the operating temperature
should be further decreased to prevent undesirable cracking. Therefore,
the development of low temperature oxygen permeable membrane is
