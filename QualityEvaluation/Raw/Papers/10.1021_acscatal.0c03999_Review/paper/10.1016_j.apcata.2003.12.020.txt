Abstract
Oxidation of propane with oxygen, nitrous oxide or oxygen together with nitrous oxide over ZSM-5 zeolites with low concentration of iron
(30–1200 ppm) treated at various conditions was studied at 450 ◦C. The highest conversion of propane (51.7%) and selectivity to propene
(39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1–C3 alcohols) was achieved if a mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide
was used as oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5. Based on the ESR results this activity was ascribed to extra-framework Fe-oxo complexes
generated by hydrolysis of framework Si–O–Fe bonds followed by extraction of iron to extra-framework positions.

1. Introduction
Light alkenes are produced by catalytic dehydrogenation
of alkanes at high temperatures, but alkane conversion is
limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. Moreover, coke
formation and the resulting catalyst deactivation represents
additional serious problem. Oxidative dehydrogenation of
alkanes removes hydrogen from the system, shifting thus
equilibrium completely to the oxidized products. But the
desired products of selective oxidations, as alkenes, alco-
hols, aldehydes and organic acids are more reactive than the
respective alkanes. This requires tailoring of highly selec-
tive catalysts providing activation of alkanes in the presence
of alkenes.
Generally, the selectivity in hydrocarbon oxidation by
molecular oxygen is mainly controlled by the state of oxy-
gen species formed within the catalyst. With mixed metal
oxide systems, like, e.g. Fe–Mo–O, Bi–Mo–O and V–P–O,
according to Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [1], lattice oxy-
gen represents the species responsible for selective oxida-
tions. Metal ions exchanged in zeolites, as Co, Fe and Mn
ions in ZSM-5 [2] and beta structures [3–5], have appeared

to be active in ethane and propane oxidation with molec-
ular oxygen to corresponding alkenes. However, the activ-
ity of both mixed metal oxides and metallo-zeolites is still
low for industrial application. Moreover, the function of
metal ion site in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over
metallo-zeolites is so far not completely understood.
In the last decade, much attention has also been devoted
to the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with nitrous oxide
to respective alcohols. Easy decomposition of nitrous oxide
leads to formation of atomic oxygen, which is a highly se-
lective oxidant providing insertion of an oxygen atom into
a hydrocarbon molecule. The most successful catalyst and
corresponding process has been developed for benzene hy-
droxylation with nitrous oxide to phenol over Fe-ZSM-5
catalyst by Panov’s group and scaled up by Monsanto Co.
[6]. Panov et al. [7] have also shown that, e.g. methane can
be oxidized with N2O to methanol, but at the temperature
needed for desorption of methanol from the catalyst its fur-
ther oxidation to carbon oxides occurred.
Although that the hydroxylation activity of H-ZSM-5
(with trace concentrations of iron) and Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts
has at ﬁrst been attributed to the protonic and Al-Lewis
sites [8–12], it has ﬁnally been evidenced [7,13–15] that the
Fe impurities in H-ZSM-5 zeolites play a decisive role in
the reaction. Particularly, the Fe ions released from the ze-
olite framework into the extra-framework positions at high

calcination temperatures or by the zeolite steaming exhibit
extremely high activity [16]. Low concentration of iron
also prevents formation of bulk iron oxide, which might
enhance hydrocarbon total combustion. The concentration
of the so-called -oxygen formed by N2O decomposition
in the zeolite, correlated well with the concentration of Fe
in the zeolite. Mössbauer and EXAFS studies of Fe zeolites
revealed presence of the dinuclear Fe complexes bearing
bridging oxygen atoms [17–20]. However, a straightforward
correlation between the concentration of these sites and
zeolite hydroxylation activity was not reported so far. Thus,
the question if the active site has a dinuclear (Fe–O–Fe) or
mononuclear (Fe–O) character is still open.
Recently, the activity of ZSM-5 zeolite with the ex-
changed Fe3+, Mn2+ and Co2+ ions in oxidative dehy-
drogenation of propane with oxygen and nitrous oxide has
been reported [2]. It was found out that with nitrous oxide,
in comparison with molecular oxygen, high selectivity to
propene was achieved, particularly on samples calcined at
relatively high temperature, 900 ◦C. The authors assume
that while -oxygen is responsible for the hydroxylation
activity, the O−species might oxidize alkanes to alkenes.
Very recently, we reported enhancement of propene produc-
tion over CoH-BEA zeolite by addition of nitrous oxide to
oxygen [21]. It has been found out that nitrous oxide is more
selective, but less active compared to molecular oxygen.
Synergy effect of oxygen and nitrous oxide led to three-fold
higher yield of propene than that one if oxygen or nitrous
oxide was used as an oxidant. There is also reported en-
hancement of the non-selective oxidation of ethane to carbon
oxides by trace concentration of iron [22], and the activity of
Fe-zeolites in the oxidation of ethane with N2O [23], where
new Fe species are expected to be formed during the reac-
tion. During preparation of this manuscript a paper has ap-
peared describing high activity in oxidation of propane with
N2O over steamed Fe-MFI zeolites [24]. The authors found
among the products mainly propene and propionaldehyde.
In this study, the effect of iron concentration and steaming
of FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites with low Fe content on their activity
in selective oxidation of propane to propene and oxygenates
is investigated and compared at conditions when as oxidant
is used oxygen or nitrous oxide or their mixture. From the
complete product analysis of propane oxidation with differ-
ent oxidants, it is speculated on the reaction pathway.

2. Experimental
2.1. Zeolites
H-ZSM-5 zeolites (originally NH4-ZSM-5) with differ-
ent iron content and treated at various conditions were used.
NH4-MFI (Si/Al = 28) with trace Fe concentration (30 ppm
Fe) and NH4-MFI (Si/Al = 28) with 1200 ppm Fe were
prepared by hydrothermal synthesis by using of tetraethy-
lorthosilicate, Al nitrate and Fe nitrate, as sources of silicon,
aluminium and iron. Preparation procedure was described in
ref. [15]. The synthesized zeolites were thoroughly washed
by distilled water, dried, and calcined in a stream of dry
oxygen at 500 ◦C for 6 h to remove the template. The NH4
forms of zeolites were prepared by repeated three times ion
exchange of the calcined material with 0.5 M NH4NO3 at
25 ◦C. NH4-MFI zeolite (Si/Al = 12.5, 190 ppm Fe) was
provided by the Research Institute of Inorganic Chemistry
Inc., CZ. A part of the NH4-MFI zeolite (Si/Al = 28,
1200 ppm Fe) and that of NH4-MFI zeolite (Si/Al = 12.5,
190 ppm Fe) was treated in a stream of oxygen containing
30% water vapor at temperature 600 ◦C for 6 h, and in addi-
tion a part of the steamed zeolite (Si/Al = 28, 1200 ppm Fe)
was transformed into Na form by repeated (three times) ion
exchange using 0.1 M NaCl solution at 25 ◦C. The elemental
analysis of zeolites was done by X-ray ﬂuorescence spec-
troscopy and inductively coupled plasma emission spectrom-
etry. The chemical analysis is given in Table 1. The samples
are labeled as follows: iron-cocation-zeolite structure-iron
concentration in ppm.
2.2. IR spectra of Fe-zeolites
The concentration of Brønsted and Lewis sites in zeolites
was determined by quantitative analysis of FTIR spectra of
adsorbed d3-acetonitrile according to procedure described
elsewhere [25]. Thin transparent self-supporting wafers of
zeolites (∼5–6 mg/cm2) were calcined at 480 ◦C with fol-
lowing evacuation. Adsorption of 1.2 kPa of d3-acetonitrile
was carried out at RT followed by evacuation for 20 min at
the same temperature. Spectra of adsorbed d3-acetonitrile
were recorded at RT with 2 cm−1 resolution by collecting
of 200 scans. The spectra intensities were normalized on a
sample thickness of 5.5 mg/cm2 using the integrated area of

the zeolite skeletal bands from 1750 to 2100 cm−1. IR bands
of adsorbed d3-acetonitrile were deconvoluted into Gaus-
sian proﬁles. A band at 2297 cm−1 was ascribed to the in-
teraction of Brønsted sites with the CN group of acetonitrile
and the bands at 2325 cm−1 corresponded to the interac-
tion of acetonitrile with Al-Lewis sites. If electron acceptor
Fe sites were present then the respective band of adsorbed
acetonitrile overlapped the band of adsorbed acetonitrile on
Brønsted sites and quantitative analysis of these sites was
not possible.
2.3. ESR spectra of Fe ions
ESR spectra of Fe3+ ions were monitored in the X-band
region on an ESR spectrometer (ERS-220, Germany). Spec-
tra were recorded at RT in the region of 30–500 mT. Before
the measurements the spectra of the samples were pretreated
in a stream of dry oxygen at 480 ◦C for 2 h, cooled to RT,
and evacuated for 30 min at 10−2 Pa. The samples were then
transferred under vacuum to a quartz cell and sealed. Mn2+
ions in a solid matrix were used as an internal standard.
2.4. Catalytic tests
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was carried out in
a ﬁxed bed through ﬂow microreactor at atmospheric pres-
sure. The amount of catalyst used was 0.2 g mixed with
1.5 cm3 of inert silicon carbide. Typically, a total ﬂow rate
was 100 cm3/min and the feed composition was 5 vol.%
of propane and 6.5 vol.% of O2 or 10 vol.% of N2O or
6.5 vol.% O2 + 10 vol.% N2O in helium. The catalysts were
pretreated in a ﬂow of oxygen at a temperature of 500 ◦C
for 2 h before each reaction run. The reactions were mea-
sured at the temperature of 450 ◦C. Analysis of the reaction
mixture was performed using on-line connected gas chro-
matograph CHROM-5 (CZ) equipped with thermal conduc-
tivity and ﬂame ionization detectors. Hydrocarbons, related
oxygenates, carbon dioxide and N2O were separated on a
packed column Porapak Q. Permanent gases (N2, O2, CO
and CH4) were separated on the molecular sieve 5A col-
umn. Conversion, selectivity and yield were calculated on
the basis of mass balance.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 illustrates IR spectra of adsorbed d3-acetonitrile on
FeH-zeolites. The spectra show that the parent zeolites con-
tain predominantly Brønsted sites and much lower concen-
tration of Lewis sites. The zeolite steaming is accompanied
by a substantial decrease in the concentration of Brønsted
sites, while that of Lewis sites is only slightly changed (see
Table 1). The structural changes occurring under zeolite
steaming were also reﬂected in the changes of the location
of Fe ions. Due to low concentration of Fe in zeolites, we

investigated the state of Fe in trivalent state by using a sen-
sitive ESR spectroscopy. In Fig. 2, there are shown the ESR
spectra of zeolites calcined in oxygen as well as steamed
ones. It is seen that in calcined zeolites some Fe is in cationic
sites, represented by a signal at g = 4.3, reﬂecting tetrahe-
drally coordinated Fe ions. After zeolite steaming the signal
at g = 4.3 increased in intensity and the signals at g = 5.6
and 6.0, appeared indicating appearance of Fe in distorted
tetrahedral coordination in extra-framework positions. Note
that the signal at g = 4.3 might reﬂects both Fe3+ in the
framework and at extra-framework sites (see [15,26,27]).
Catalytic activity of FeH-zeolites expressed in terms of
propane conversion, yield of propene and product selectivity
with respect to hydrocarbons and oxygenates, is summa-
rized in Table 2. The results of propane oxidation in oxy-
gen, nitrous oxide and in their mixture over FeH-ZSM-5
with various Fe content, regardless of the state of iron, evi-
dence that the active sites are exclusively Fe centers, and that
the protonic sites are not responsible for the zeolite redox
activity, although they can participate in acid-like transfor-
mations within the reactant–product mixture. These results
represent further support for the conclusion that the redox
activity of H-zeolites is only apparent, caused in fact by
the highly active Fe sites always present in trace concentra-
tions in the zeolites, as already reported for the reactions of
NO–NO2 equilibration [28,29], and benzene oxidation with
N2O [7,13–15]. Hundreds of ppm of Fe are usually present

pared by standard synthesis procedure.
All the investigated zeolites exhibited low activity in the
oxidation of propane with oxygen at conditions selected in
this study. The activities of catalysts are compared at the re-
action time-on-stream (T-O-S) of 400 min. The conversion
of propane reached maximally 3.4% for the steamed zeo-
lite with maximum iron content. The main products were
propene and carbon oxides. Selectivity towards propene
reached 44.0%, but the yield was only 1.5%. It means that
the iron present in the zeolite do not signiﬁcantly activate
molecular oxygen under the reaction conditions to provide
propane oxidation.
Replacement of oxygen in propane oxidation with nitrous
oxide led to a dramatic increase in propane conversion over
FeH-MFI zeolites, particularly over the zeolites steamed at
600 ◦C (3.4% versus 43.5% for FeH-MFI-1200-HT). An in-
crease in the activity was also accompanied by a substan-
tial increase in the selectivity to propene (44.0% versus
55.9%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (0%
versus 29.0%); being again the highest with the steamed
zeolites. Among the products appeared methanol, ethanol,
iso- and n-propanol, phenol and acetone. Also the products
of propane cracking, i.e. methane, ethane and ethene ap-
peared when N2O was used. On the other hand, an increase
in propane conversion over FeH-MFI-190-C calcined in dry
oxygen (3.8% versus 1.2%), when N2O instead of oxygen
was used, was much lower. It implies that using N2O as
oxidant compared to oxygen resulted in the higher propane
conversions, higher selectivity to propene and in the appear-
ance of alcohols in the products as well as of products of
propane cracking and propene dimerization. These enhance-
ments were higher with increasing Fe content in the zeolite
and with the zeolites steamed at high temperature compared
to those calcined in dry oxygen.
These results suggest that nitrous oxide is activated on
the extra-framework Fe sites generated from the framework
sites by zeolite steaming, but to much less extent by cal-
cination of the zeolite in a dry oxygen stream, as follows
from the ESR spectra of the Fe ions (see Fig. 2). It has been
shown that the iron in the synthetized zeolites is mainly in
the framework positions, in addition to Fe in iron oxide-like
species. Such framework sites as well as oxide species are
not active in N2O decomposition and generation of active
oxygen species is connected with the process of leaching
of Fe to the cationic sites. Panov and co-workers [7,13,14]
and Kubánek et al. [15] reported that calcination of the zeo-
lite at 480 ◦C under dry oxygen does not lead to extraction
of a substantial amount of iron from the tetrahedral frame-
work positions and, therefore, calcined Fe-zeolites did not
exhibit substantial catalytic activity. Upon the steaming at
600 ◦C, the tetrahedrally coordinated Fe in the framework is
extracted to the cationic positions by hydrolysis of Si–O–Fe
bonds [15,16]. This process leads to formation of various
iron species, including isolated iron ions and oligonuclear Fe
species. Sobolev et al. [30] reported that the iron ions with
the so-called -site are not able to activate molecular oxy-
gen, but they decompose nitrous oxide to molecular nitrogen
and atomic oxygen bound to extra-framework Fe sites. The
Fe species reﬂected in the ESR spectra by the signals at g
=5.6 and 6.0 are expected to be the sites active in N2O ox-
idations, while the signal at g = 4.3 did not correlate with
the zeolite activity in benzene hydroxylation [15].
Oxidation of propane with N2O over the steamed
Fe-zeolites led to production of a high amount of propene.
In addition, a considerable amount of other oxygenates
(methanol, ethanol, iso-propyl and n-propyl alcohol, phenol
and acrolein) and aromatics (benzene and toluene) were
formed. Only small amount of propane was lost by its oxi-
dation to carbon oxides. However, the catalyst performance
depended on the reaction time-on-stream. Fig. 3 shows the
dependence of propane conversion, propene yield, and se-
lectivity to propene and the sum of oxygenates and higher
hydrocarbons on T-O-S over steamed FeH-MFI-1200 cat-
alyst. With decreasing propane conversion from 63.0 to
43.5%, the selectivity to propene increased as well as the
yield of propene, which reached ca. 24% within 100 min
T-O-S and then remained relatively constant. On the other
hand, the selectivity to the sum of known oxygenates re-
main nearly constant with T-O-S (it change from 24.6 to
26.4%) as well as the selectivity to the sum of products of
propane cracking (7.1%). The distribution of oxygenates
was substantially changed with T-O-S, as given in Table 3.

substantially decreases from 10 to 2.6%. Aromatics nearly
disappeared within the T-O-S experiment, and accordingly
decreased the selectivity to phenol. As for iso-propyl alco-
hol, its selectivity increased with the reaction time. However,
the substantial amount of unknown products formed during
the early stage of the reaction, which nearly disappeared
within the T-O-S experiment. Some coke was deposited on
the catalyst surface during the reaction. We suppose that
the deactivation of catalysts is caused by formation of car-
bonaceous deposits blocking the active surface. Formation
of coke can be mostly connected with the presence of strong
acidic protons in the zeolite surface as well as by the pres-
ence of Fe and Al electron acceptor sites. Blocking of these
acid sites is accompanied by the observed lower selectivity
to aromatics and phenol, and thus the higher selectivity to
propene and propanols.
Oxidation of propane with N2O over Na form compared
to H form of steamed zeolite (FeNa-MFI-1200-HT, contain-
ing trace concentration of Brønsted sites) was manifested
in a slightly lower propane conversion, lower degree of de-
activation with T-O-S, resulting in the higher selectivity to
propene and constant yield of propene, as well as in a consid-
erably lower selectivity to the sum of hydrocarbons and phe-
nol excluding propene and iso-propyl alcohol (see Table 4
and Fig. 4). Stable reaction performance was achieved within
300 min with respect to all products.
From the product analysis and performance of the cata-
lysts in T-O-S, it can be speculated that the ﬁrst step of the
propane oxidation with N2O is cracking of propane to lower
weight hydrocarbons and propene dimerization to benzene.
Simultaneously, propane and other hydrocarbons are oxi-
dized to alcohols and phenol. However, the product compo-
sitions at different zeolites do not allow us to speculate how
propene is formed either by simple oxidative dehydrogena-
tion or via alcohols dehydration. Further studies are needed
to the reaction pathway.
Using a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants
resulted with all the catalysts in an increase in propane
nconversion accompanied by a substantial increase in the
selectivity to carbon oxides and a decrease in the propene
selectivity, but not in substantial changes in the propene
yields. The selectivity to and production of oxygenates and
aromatics decreased dramatically, and C1–C3 alcohols were
the most populated products among oxygenates.
Different T-O-S behavior of propane conversion was ob-
served depending on the oxidation agents used (see Fig. 5).
With molecular oxygen no deactivation occurred, while with
N2O a substantial deactivation was found, being slightly
slower with the Na-form compared to H-form of the Fe
zeolite. This ﬁnding corresponds to the presence of acidic
protonic sites, which catalyze oligomerization and aroma-
tization and hydrogen transfer reactions (as seen from the
product composition) leading to formation of coke precur-
sors. Moreover, the N2O presence can initiate radical reac-
tions. Participation of radicals in the oxidation process also
supports formation of coke precursors. If, on the other hand,
a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide was employed a lower
deactivation in T-O-S was observed compared to the oxida-
tion only with nitrous oxide. A lower deactivation during the
oxidation reaction with a mixture of N2O and oxygen can
be attributed to the oxidation of the reaction intermediates
to carbon oxides by molecular oxygen.

The obtained data cannot provide clear conclusion on

[31,32] investigated dehydrogenation of light alkanes
(mainly ethane) to alkenes by O−stabilized at the surface
of MgO after the reaction of N2O with electrons trapped on
the surface. They suggested that the net reaction involves
hydrogen abstraction from alkane with formation of surface
OH−group and alkyl radical (like for gas phase reactions),
which is transformed to alkoxides via reaction with O2−.

formed from the reaction of alkyl cation with O2−from
MgO, which was formed via the preceding reaction of alkyl
radical with a hole in MgO.
However, the suggestion on the formation of propene
with participation of O−species [2] and of alcohols through
the -oxygen does not seem to be likely mechanism. The
product composition indicates that under propane oxidation
with nitrous oxide, a spectrum of C1–C6 alcohols is readily
formed (sum of their selectivity is 15–25%, with the highest
selectivity to propyl alcohols). Their formation is a result of
22

propane cracking and oligomerization to C1–C6 hydrocar-
bons. While alcohols formation can be expected to proceeds
via -oxygen, mechanism of formation of propene is not
clear. Either reaction pathway through alcohol dehydration
or direct propane oxidative dehydrogenation can be expected
to occur.
The highest yields of alcohols and propene found with the
steamed highly loaded Fe zeolite, i.e. with the zeolite with
the highest concentration of the extra-framework Fe sites,
reﬂected in the ESR signals at g = 5.6 and 6.0, indicates that
the Fe species bearing the -sites predominantly control the
described reaction.
4. Conclusions
Oxidation of propane with oxygen, nitrous oxide or with
a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide over calcined and
steamed FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites with various Fe contents
(30–1200 ppm) demonstrated high catalytic activity of the
steamed zeolites in the propane oxidation by N2O and low
activity if only oxygen was employed. The use of N2O as an
oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5 leads to very high se-
lectivity to propene (56%), in addition to C1–C6 alcohols, at
relatively high propane conversion (44%). Yield of propene
is comparable to that one achieved with most active mixed
metal oxides for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. An
advantage of this catalytic system is a substantially lower
reaction temperature (450 ◦C) in comparison with the mixed
metal oxide catalysts operating in the temperature range
550–650 ◦C. In addition to propene, other valuable products
as ethene, methanol, ethanol and acetone are formed.
The activity of Fe-zeolites depends on the Fe content
and conditions of zeolite pre-treatments. The highest cat-
alytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe con-
tent steamed in the ﬂow of water vapor at 600 ◦C. The level
of deactivation of the FeH-ZSM-5 catalyst might be de-
creased by using of a suitable ratio of N2O/O2 and by elim-
ination of protonic sites. In agreement with the conclusions
of Panov’s group on hydroxylation of benzene with nitrous
oxide, the catalytic activity in propane oxidation by N2O
was ascribed to the presence extra-framework Fe species
in ZSM-5. Propane oxidation to propene by nitrous oxide
and/or by its mixture with oxygen might be advantageously
applied using tail gases from adipic acid, as suggested for
benzene oxidation with N2O to phenol [33], or those from
the other technology units producing nitrous oxide.
