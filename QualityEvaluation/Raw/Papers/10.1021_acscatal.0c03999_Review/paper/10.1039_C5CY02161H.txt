Hydrothermal synthesis method was adopted to prepare a highly active Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst (GA-HS), 
which displayed superior catalytic performance for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the 
presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2). The highest propane conversion on GA-HS was 35.2%, which was much 
higher than the catalysts prepared using grind-mixture method (8.7%) or coprecipitation method (26.2%). 
10 
Moreover, propylene selectivity over GA-HS catalyst was higher than that over other catalysts in a period 
of 9 h reaction. These catalysts were characterized by N2 physical adsorption, ICP-AES, XRD, TGA, 
TEM, SEM, DRIFT, Py-FTIR, NH3-TPD, XPS, 27Al MAS NMR and 71Ga MAS NMR techniques. The 
characterization data indicated that hydrothermal treatment increased the surface area, expanded the pore 
size and promoted the formation of more tetrahedral Ga ions and generation of more medium-strong 
15 
Lewis acid sites. Furthermore, this catalyst mainly displayed amorphous sponge-like morphology as well 
as a new morphology that some pieces were covered with amorphous nanoparticles. The superior activity 
of GA-HS was attributed to higher surface area of this catalyst and larger amount of tetrahedral Ga ions 
(Ga3+ and probably Gaδ+ δ< 2) related to medium-strong Lewis acid sites. 
1. Introduction 
20 
At present, urgent demand of propylene has drawn academic and 
industrial sectors’ attention to deeply investigating the catalytic 
dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, for it represents a way 
in which more expensive alkenes can be produced economically 
from low-cost saturated hydrocarbons.1, 
2 However, the 
25 
dehydrogenation of propane has inherent disadvantages such as 
thermodynamic limitations for propane conversion, high energy 
requirements ascribed to endothermic reaction and limited 
catalytic stability in virtue of coke formation, etc.3, 4 Recently, 
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen as an 
30 
alternative process for propylene production offers a new 
promising technology in term of its energy-saving. By using 
oxygen as oxidant, the dehydrogenation can be proceeded well, 
but dramatic decrease of propylene selectivity due to excessive 
propane oxidation is still a problem.2 Considering that, CO2 as a 
35 
mild oxidant is used to develop a safer and more economical 
process for propane dehydrogenation.5-7 With introduction of 
CO2, the dehydrogenation efficiency is increased because of the 
new additional production process of propylene: a direct surface 
redox mechanism in which the catalyst undergoes reduction (by 
40 
propane) and reoxidation (by carbon dioxide) cycles8-10 or a more 
complex reaction pathway involving a simple dehydrogenation 
followed by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.11-13  
Ga2O3-containg catalysts have been considered for alkane 
oxidative dehydrogenation processes due to their relatively good 
45 
catalytic performance.14-34 This was verified by Nakagawa et al.35 
According to their result, the commercial Ga2O3 showed higher 
activity in the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the 
presence of CO2, compared with Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts. 
Zheng et al.36 investigated dehydrogenation of propane to 
50 
propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2) over four 
polymorphs of gallium oxides. They thought that the superior 
performance of β-Ga2O3 catalyst was ascribed to an abundance of 
surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to the unsaturated 
Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide. The 
55 
optimal propane conversion and  propylene selectivity could 
achieve to 23% and 95% respectively, at 500 °C with feed gas 
mixture (CO2/C3H8 molar ratio = 2:1) and flow rate of 3 L g-1 h-1. 
Based on that, supported gallium oxide catalysts (Ga2O3/TiO2, 
Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/SiO2, Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/MgO) were 
60 
also used for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2 
by Bingjun Xu et al.37 It was found that Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, 
and 
Ga2O3/ZrO2 
showed 
a 
stronger 
ability 
for 
the 
dehydrogenation of propane than Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, 
due to the abundant medium-strong Lewis acid sites on these 
65 
catalysts’ surface and special interactions between the support 
and Ga2O3. Ga2O3/TiO2 showed the highest activity, and the 
propane conversion over this catalyst highly achieved to 39% at 
600 °C with feed gas mixture (CO2/C3H8 molar ratio= 2:1) and 
flow rate of 6 L g-1 h-1. Michorczyk et al.30 prepared ordered 
70 
mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 by nanocasting, which were 
used as effective catalysts for DHP-CO2. The results revealed that 
the pure mesoporous gallium and gallium-aluminum oxides 
(Ga/Al = 4:1) exhibited a promising catalytic performance in the 
DHP-CO2. Over the most active materials, propylene was

produced with the yield of 10-18% and high selectivity of 91-95% 
during 4 h on stream at 550 °C with feed gas mixture (CO2/C3H8 
molar ratio= 5:1) and flow rate of 9 L g-1 h-1. Moreover, Chen et 
al.11, 12 studied the effect of preparation method and treatment 
process on the activity and stability of Ga2O3-containg catalysts 
5 
for the dehydrogenation of propane. The results suggested that 
larger amount of surface Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity were 
presented on gallia-alumina solid solution prepared using 
coprecipitation method than that on the Ga2O3–Al2O3 oxide 
catalysts prepared using physical mixture method, thereby 
10 
leading to its better performance in propane dehydrogenation 
with CO2. It was found that the initial conversion of propane and 
selectivity of propylene over Ga8Al2O15 were 49.7% and 91.7% 
respectively, at 500 °C with feed gas mixture (CO2/C3H8 molar 
ratio = 2:1) and flow rate of 3 L g-1 h-1. For the sake of deeply 
15 
understanding this reaction, many researchers36-38 drew their 
attention to investigating the influence of surface Ga3+ in Ga2O3-
containg catalysts on dehydrogenation of propane. And their 
results suggested that hydrocarbon activation proceeded on low-
coordinated Ga3+ cations, accordingly forming propyl-Ga 
20 
species,36, 37 and the dehydrogenation products were then 
generated via subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-
Ga species. Specifically speaking, the low-coordinated Ga3+ sites 
over gallium oxide were highly effective in the heterolytic 
dissociative adsorption of propane, because of the very strong 
25 
polarizability of the C–H bonds resulted from perturbation of 
propane on the low-coordinated Ga3+ sites.39 It’s obvious that 
more active catalysts for propane dehydrogenation can be 
obtained by getting a higher population of low-coordinated 
surface Ga3+ sites in the Ga2O3-containg catalysts.  
30 
In this work, a facile hydrothermal synthesis method was 
adopted to prepare a Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst for DHP-CO2. The as-
prepared catalyst displayed better catalytic performance than the 
catalysts prepared using grind-mixture method or coprecipitation 
method. We have in-detail rationalized the results by various 
35 
characterizations such as N2 physical adsorption, ICP-AES, XRD, 
TEM, TGA, SEM, DRIFT, Py-FTIR, NH3-TPD, XPS, 27Al MAS 
NMR and 71Ga MAS NMR techniques, and aimed to unveil the

2. Experimental section 
2.1 Catalyst preparation  
Herein, Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts as well as the simple oxide of 
Ga2O3 and Al2O3 were prepared using different methods as 
45 
follows.  
Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can be obtained from Ga(NO3)3 and 
Al(NO3)3 respectively through the  same treatment of drying at 
120 °C for 8 h in constant temperature oven and subsequent 
calcinations at 550 °C for 5 h (from room temperature to 550 °C 
50 
at a ramp rate of 3 °C/min) under static air in a muffle oven.  
Grind-mixture method: 0.01 mol Ga(NO3)3 and 0.02 mol 
Al(NO3)3 (Ga/Al = 1:2) as the precursors were firstly mixed and 
ground, followed by drying at 120 °C for 8 h in constant 
temperature oven. The resulting mixture was heated to 550 °C 
55 
from room temperature at a ramp rate of 3 °C/min, and kept for 5 
h under static air in a muffle oven, the catalyst was obtained and 
defined as GA-GM. 
Coprecipitation method: the Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalyst was 
prepared through an alcoholic coprecipitation pathway.40 In a 
60 
typical synthesis, 0.01 mol Ga(NO3)3 and 0.02 mol Al(NO3)3 
(Ga/Al = 1:2) were completely dissolved in 40 mL ethanol. Then, 
40 mL concentrated aqueous ammonia (28 wt%) was added 
dropwise to above ethanol solution. The resulting suspension was 
filtrated and washed by ethanol. After that, the cake was dried at 
65 
120 °C for 8 h in constant temperature oven, followed by 
calcination at 550 °C for 5 h (from room temperature to 550 °C at 
a ramp rate of 3 °C/min). The obtained catalyst was defined as 
GA-CP. 
Hydrothermal synthesis method: 0.01 mol Ga(NO3)3 and 0.02 
70 
mol Al(NO3)3 (Ga/Al = 1:2) were completely dissolved in 40 mL 
ethanol. Then, 40 mL concentrated aqueous ammonia (28 wt%) 
was added dropwise to above ethanol solution. The resulting 
suspension was transferred into 200 ml Teﬂon cup inserted in 
stainless steel autoclave, then heated to 170 °C from room 
75 
temperature at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min and kept for 24 h. After 
that, the crystalline product was washed repetitively with ethanol, 
followed by drying at 120 °C for 8 h in constant temperature 
oven, and calcined at 550 °C for 5 h under static air like that of 
coprecipitation method. The obtained catalyst was defined as 
80 
GA-HS. 
Compared with GA-HS, pure Ga (G-HS) and Al (A-HS) were 
prepared using hydrothermal synthesis method. Moreover, 
Ga2O3-Al2O3 materials with different Ga/Al molar ratios (1:1 and 
2:1) were also prepared by grind-mixture method, coprecipitation 
85 
method and hydrothermal synthesis method, defined as G1A1-
GM, G2A1-GM, G1A1-CP, G2A1-CP, G1A1-HS and G2A1-HS 
respectively. 
2.2 Catalyst characterization  
The textural properties of catalyst were measured by N2 physical 
90 
sorption at 77K using a Tristar 3000 machine. Surface areas were 
calculated by the BET method and micro-, meso-, and macropore 
volumes were calculated by the t-plot method.  
      The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured 
on a Rigaku MiniFlex II X-ray diffractometer using CuKα 
95 
radiation. The anode was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The 2θ 
angles were scanned from 10° to 70°. 
       Diffuse reflectance infrared spectra (DRIFT) measurements 
were performed using a Bruker Tensor 27 instrument with a MCT 
detector (64 scans, 4 cm−1). Simply, 20 mg of catalyst was put it 
100 
in an infrared cell with KBr windows for in-situ treatments. The 
DRIFT spectra were recorded after treating the catalyst at 300 °C 
for 1 h with a flow of argon.  
      Pyridine-adsorbed Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy 
(Py-FTIR) was used to determine the amount of Brønsted acid 
105 
sites and Lewis acid sites using Bruker Tensor 27 equipment. 20 
mg of catalyst was pressed into a regular wafer (R = 1.3 cm) and 
then put in an infrared cell. The infrared spectrum was recorded 
after sample treatment at 400 °C for 2 h under vacuum, wherein 
this spectrum was used as background for the adsorbed pyridine 
110 
experiments. Pyridine was then adsorbed to a 5.0×10-2 Pa 
equilibrium pressure at 40 °C. FTIR spectra were recorded after 
consecutive evacuation at 400 °C.

TPD) was used to test the amount and strength of the Lewis acid 
or Brønsted acid sites of as-prepared catalysts in TP-5080 
chemisorption instrument. The catalyst (100 mg) was pre-treated 
at 500 °C under a flow of N2 (30 ml/min) for 2 h and then cooled 
down to 100 °C. Then NH3 was introduced into the flow system. 
5 
The TPD spectra were recorded after about 1h evacuation time 
until the baseline of TCD signal is steady at a ramp rate of 
10 °C/min from 100 °C to 600 °C.  
      X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyse 
the change of surface composition measured by AXIS ULTRA 
10 
DLD equipment. The binding energy values were corrected for 
charging effect by referring to the adventitious C1s line at 284.5 
eV. 
   The chemical compositions (Al and Ga) of as-prepared samples 
were determined by an inductively coupled plasma-atomic 
15 
emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) method using Thermo iCAP 
6300 equipment.  
71Ga MAS NMR measurements were performed on Bruker 
AVANCE III 600 MHz equipment. 71Ga MAS NMR spectra 
were obtained by a single pulse length of Π/6, and Ga chemical 
20 
shifts were referenced to Ga(NO3)3.  
27Al MAS NMR measurements were performed on Bruker 
AVANCE III 600 MHz equipment. 27Al MAS NMR spectra were 
obtained by a single pulse length of Π/6, and Al chemical shifts 
were referenced to Al(NO3)3.  
25 
Transmission electron microscopies (TEM) were performed 
using a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope. 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained 
for morphologic identification using a JSM-7001F. 
      Pulsed reaction technique was used to measure the activities 
30 
of these catalysts and carried out on chemisorption instrument 
(TP-5080) and OMNI star. Transient responses of m/z = 44 (C3H8 
and CO2) and m/z = 44, 43 (C3H8) over as-prepared catalysts was 
tested by an on-line mass spectrometer against a pulsed 
introduction of C3H8 under steady flow of mixture gas (10% CO2 
35 
and 90% Ar). Reaction conditions: catalyst = 100 mg; CO2 and Ar 
carrier = 30 mlmin-1; C3H8 = 1 ml; furnace temperature = 550°C. 
    Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a 
Rigaku TG analyzer to determine the amount of coke deposited 
on the catalyst after the reaction. 10 mg of sample was heated 
40 
from room temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min 
in flowing air. 
2.3 Catalyst evaluation  
The catalyst test was carried out in a horizontal quartz tube fixed-
bed reactor. Reaction conditions: T = 550 °C; P = 100 kPa; mcat. = 
45 
150 mg; the feed gas mixture C3H8/CO2/N2 with the molar ratio 
of 1:3:27; total flow rate = 15 cm3·min−1.  
The products were analysed by off-line gas chromatograph 
(HUAAI GC 9560) equipped with a FID with Al2O3 packed 
column, and offline gas chromatograph (East & West GC 4000A) 
50 
equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with carbon 
molecular sieves packed column, respectively. The propane 
conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated using the 
following eqs (1) and (2).

3. Results and discussion 
65 
3.1 Catalyst test 
The conversion of propane and the selectivity of propylene over 
these as-prepared samples as a function of time on stream are 
shown in Fig. 1. Compared with single Al2O3, the activity of 
Ga2O3-containg catalysts are remarkably superior for propane 
70 
dehydrogenation (Fig. 1A), indicating that the presence of Ga 
species is necessary to generate active sites for propane 
dehydrogenation.35 Especially on GA-HS, the initial propane 
conversion is the highest (35.2%), which is much higher than that 
on Ga2O3 (5.7%), GA-GM (8.7%) and GA-CP (26.2%). From 
75 
Fig. 1B, it is noticeable that propylene selectivity over these 
Ga2O3-containing catalysts achieve to about 95.0%, which are 
obviously higher than that on single Al2O3 (only 73.2%). 
Propylene selectivity over Ga2O3 and GA-GM decrease by 13.7% 
and 26.5 % respectively after 9 h reaction, while that over GA-
80 
HS and GA-CP almost remain unchanged during the running 
period accompanied by the decline of propane conversion. 
Seemingly, the propylene selectivity over GA-HS is slightly 
higher than that over GA-CP. These test results suggest that the 
activities of Ga2O3-containing catalysts are strongly affected by 
85 
the preparation method and treatment process. And our adopted 
hydrothermal synthesis method is remarkably favourable for 
preparing the catalyst for efficient dehydrogenation of propane, in 
comparison with the grind-mixture method or coprecipitation 
method. In addition, pure Ga2O3 (G-HS) and Al2O3 (A-HS) are 
90 
prepared using hydrothermal synthesis method in comparison 
with GA-HS. The initial propane conversions on G-HS and A-HS 
are 21.4% and 0.8% (Fig. S1a) respectively, much lower than that 
on GA-HS, implying that single Ga2O3 or Al2O3 component is 
indifferent for propane dehydrogenation but their synergistic 
95 
effect is active due to forming special structure. Besides, the rapid 
decreases of propylene selectivity on G-HS and A-HS (Fig. S1b) 
are seen with increase of time on stream in comparison with GA-
HS. Moreover, Ga2O3-Al2O3 materials with different Ga/Al molar 
ratios (1:1 and 2:1) are also investigated. From evaluation results 
100 
of these catalysts, it’s found that the conversions of propane on 
the Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts are enhanced with the increase of 
Ga/Al molar ratio (Fig. S1a). Wherein, the Ga2O3-Al2O3 prepared 
using hydrothermal synthesis method still shows the superior 
activity for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 to 
105 
those catalysts prepared using grind-mixture method and 
coprecipitation method with the same Ga/Al molar ratio. The 
propylene selectivity over the hydrothermally prepared catalyst 
achieves to about 95.0 % during the whole test period like the 
coprecipitated-prepared catalyst (Fig. S1b), which is higher than

that over the catalyst prepared by grind-mixture method. 
In order to study the effect of CO2 on this reaction, the catalytic 
tests without CO2 are performed over these Ga2O3-Al2O3 
catalysts for comparison (Fig. S2 and Table S1). The initial 
15 
conversions of propane on these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts without 
CO2 are higher than that with CO2, indicating that the presence of 
carbon dioxide is not positive to promote the dehydrogenation of 
propane as expected. Xu et al.37 considered that the negative 
effect was been attributed to the greatly reduced propane 
20 
adsorption capacity due to the competition of CO2. However, 
compared with catalytic tests in presence of CO2, rapid 
deactivation of these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts in the absence of CO2 
is observed. And propane conversions on these Ga2O3-Al2O3 
catalysts testing in presence of CO2 are higher than that in the 
25 
absence of CO2 after 9 h on stream. It can be indicated that the 
presence of CO2 is beneficial for improving durability of the 
catalysts. The enhanced stability of these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts 
in the presence of CO2 may be due to their low coking 
tendency.12 In addition, the primary product (propylene) and by-
30 
products (methane, ethylene, ethane, etc.) are formed during the 
dehydrogenation process of propane regardless of the presence of 
CO2. However, it is worthy to note that the selectivity to by-
products over these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of CO2 
is lower than that in the absence of CO2. It is thought that CO2 as 
35 
a mild oxidant can promote the dehydrogenation of propane 
preferentially and weaken the cracking and hydrocracking 
reactions somewhat, thereby increasing the selectivity of target 
product propylene compared with that in absence of CO2. With 
the observation of higher conversion of CO2 and lower molar 
40 
ratio H2/CO over GA-HS (Table S1), it can be further confirmed 
that GA-HS has superior activity to GA-GM and GA-CP in the 
present reaction. The catalytic tests of GA-HS after regeneration 
with air or CO2 are performed (Fig. S3). The comparative results 
of regeneration with O2 and CO2 indicate that both agents are 
45 
effective in coke removing. But propane conversion and 
propylene selectivity on regenerated GA-HS with CO2 after 9h 
reaction on stream are much lower than that with air, implying 
that the CO2 can partly remove the coke through Boudouard 
reaction. 37 
50 
Considering the distinction of test conditions (such as reaction 
temperature, GHSV and CO2/C3H8 molar ratio of feed gas 
mixture, etc.), it is difficult to make a certain conclusion that 
which preparation method is more preferential by comparing the 
activities of the Ga2O3-containing catalysts prepared by different 
55 
researchers. But it is widely accepted that the presence of Lewis 
acid sites related to Ga3+ ions in tetrahedral sites, which is 
obtained through special treatment process such as hydrothermal 
synthesis, is favourable for propane dehydrogenation. However, 
propane conversion and propylene selectivity over GA-HS are 
60 
higher than that over these catalysts prepared using grind-mixture 
method or coprecipitation method at the same test conditions, 
indicating that the hydrothermal synthesis can improve the 
activity of Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts greatly. In this work, we focus 
on the effect of preparation method on the activity of Ga2O3-
65 
Al2O3 catalysts for DHP-CO2. 
Propane conversions over these Ga2O3-containing samples all 
decrease as a function of reaction time. Wherein, it is thought that 
this gradual deactivation of the catalysts is caused by the coke

deposition on the surface of these catalysts.25, 36 Based on that, 
coke deposition on the spent Ga-containing samples is quantified 
by TG-DTA as show in Fig. 2A. The weight loss of these spent 
samples decreases in the order: GA-HS > GA-CP > GA-GM > 
Ga2O3. Spent GA-HS displays maximum weight loss compared 
5 
with the Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts prepared using grind-mixture 
method or coprecipitation method, demonstrating its high coke 
performance. Published work19, 30 reported that the high catalytic 
performance of Ga-containing materials is attributed to the 
surface gallium sites with Lewis acidity, which are also the coke 
10 
deposition sites. For the present catalysts, GA-HS should possess 
more Lewis acid sites than the others based on its relatively good 
performance (as shown in Fig. 1A). That implies that there are 
more coke deposition sites existed on GA-HS. Moreover, the 
initial conversion of propane (Fig. S2) and the initial selectivity 
15 
of propylene (Table S1) over these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts in the 
absence of CO2 are much higher. This result suggests that the 
concentration of propylene in the absence of CO2 in the initial 
step is also high. Because the propylene is more reactive than 
propane, its higher concentration in reaction zone leads probably 
20 
to higher coke amount, which also contributes to fast deactivation 
of catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane in terms of 
substrates-products reactivity.17, 30 Thus, the coke is easily formed 
on GA-HS catalyst during DHP-CO2 process due to its high 
activity. In addition, the coke also has significant effects on the 
25 
durability of these catalysts. As our observation, the propane 
conversion decrease dramatically with increase of time

(Fig. 2B) show that both spent GA-GM and spent Ga2O3 only 
display one peak at 460 °C and 426 °C respectively, 
corresponding to one type of carbon species. But the spent GA-
40 
CP shows two peaks at 454 °C and 479 °C assigned to two 
different types of carbon species. Spent GA-HS displays a similar 
DTA profile to the spent GA-CP, but with higher amounts of 
carbon species. Nevertheless, it deserves further study to 
understand the details about the mechanism of formation of 
45 
different carbon species. 
3.2 Catalyst composition and textural properties 
The pore volume, pore size and BET surface areas (SBET) of 
different catalysts are obtained based on sorption isotherms of N2 
condensation at 77 K. N2-sorption isotherms of these catalysts 
50 
(Fig. S4) are a type ІV with a steep increase around P/P0 = 0.4, 
indicating that these samples belong to typical mesoporous 
materials.41, 42  From the profiles of pore size distributions in Fig. 
3, it can be seen that GA-GM and GA-CP have a very narrow 
pore size distribution with average pore diameter 7.6 nm and 7.9 
55 
nm respectively, while GA-HS has a broad pore size distribution 
with average pore diameter 12.5 nm. This suggests that special 
pore structure can be produced after the hydrothermal treatment. 
The BET surface area and total volumes of the catalysts are 
calculated and the results are shown in Table 1. The BET surface 
60 
area and total volumes of GA-HS are 234 m2/g and 0.730 cm3/g 
respectively, higher than that of GA-GM, GA-CP, pure Ga2O3 
and pure Al2O3. In combination with the above test results,

it is thought that active Ga species can be more easily dipersed on 
5 
GA-HS due to its high BET surface and volumes than that of GA-
GM and GA-CP, thereby leading to its good performance 
probably. Moreover, the higher micropore surface area and 
micropore volumes of GA-CP than that of GA-HS and GA-GM 
means that using a coprecipitation method can lead to the 
10 
preferential formation of  micropores over GA-CP than other 
catalysts. Based on the larger number of mes- and macro-pores in 
GA-HS than GA-CP and GA-GM, the conclusion can be made 
that hydrothermal synthesis promotes the formation of mes- and 
macro-pores 
over 
the 
Ga2O3-Al2O3 
catalyst, 
but 
the 
15 
coprecipitation method is in favor of formation of micropores. 
To clarify the thermal stability of the catalyst prepared by 
hydrothermal method, the textural properties of the samples after 
DHP-CO2 test and regeneration with air have been characterized 
by low N2 adsorption and the data is listed in Table 2. Compared 
20 
with the fresh samples, the spent GA-CP and spent GA-HS both 
show obvious decrease in the SBET (decrease by 96.2 m2/g and 
74.0 m2/g) and pore volume (decrease by 0.297 m3/g and 0.543 
m3/g) respectively, whereas the spent GA-GM shows some 
increase in the SBET and pore volume (incease by 33.1 m2/g and 
25 
0.014 m3/g) due to cumuli of coke deposition. After regeneration 
with air, pores of these spent Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts are recovered 
partly. And the regenerated GA-HS still shows the highest SBET 
and pore volume among these regenerated samples, indicating 
that the hydrothermal synthesis method is superior to other 
30 
preparation methods in this work. 
Fig. 4 illustrates the XRD patterns of these Ga2O3-Al2O3 
catalysts, along with simple Ga2O3 and Al2O3. The diffraction 
lines of the as-prepared samples are very broad, demonstrating a 
low crystallinity of all the samples. This low crystallinity is a 
35 
common feature of metastable γ-variety of both alumina and 
gallia polymorphs.12 The as-prepared Ga2O3 reveals the typical 
characteristics of γ-Ga2O3 inferred from the 2θ angles (30.8°, 
36.2° and 64.2° in curve a) of diffraction peak, while simple 
Al2O3 suggests the typical characteristics of γ-Al2O3 based on the 
40 
2θ angles (45.4°, 60.3° and 67.1° in curve e) of the diffraction 
peak. GA-GM closely resembles γ-Ga2O3 and γ-Al2O3 in the light 
of diffraction maxima (curve b), indicating that no new structures

are formed in physical mixture process. Yet GA-CP and GA-HS 
don’t exhibit typical characteristics of simple γ-Ga2O3 and/or γ-
Al2O3 like GA-GM. d(440) spacing corresponds to cubic lattice 
parameter a0,  which can be used to distinguish the cubic spinel-
type structure (gallia-alumina solid solution) by the location of 
55 
(440) peak.40 It can be seen that the (440) peaks of γ-Ga2O3 and γ-
Al2O3 are located at 64.2° and 67.1° respectively. The (440) peaks 
of GA-CP and GA-HS lie between that of γ-Ga2O3 and γ-Al2O3, 
indicating that the cubic spinel-type structures are formed on GA-
CP and GA-HS.43 In comparison with GA-CP, the (440) peak of 
60 
GA-HS shifts to high 2θ angle due to preparation method. This

suggests that different structure presents on GA-CP and GA-HS 
in despite of the presence of similar cubic spinel-type structures 
on these two catalysts, which results in their activity differences 
for propane dehydrogenation. 
3.3 Coordination state and oxidation state of Ga  
5 
To reflect the coordination state of Ga3+ ion, the 71Ga MAS NMR 
chemical shift measurements are conducted and the spectra of 
different catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. The two asymmetric bands 
within -100 ppm ~ 300 ppm are assigned to tetrahedral Ga (GaT) 
ions and octahedral Ga (GaO) ions, respectively.14, 40, 44-46 Peak 
10 
deconvolution of the NMR GaT and GaO bands are also done to 
provide more information about the Ga distribution (among 
tetrahedral and octahedral sites) in the structure of these catalysts. 
The deconvoluted results in Table 3 suggest that most of Ga ions 
in GA-GM and Ga2O3 occupy octahedral GaO sites while that in 
15 
GA-CP and GA-HS are mainly located at tetrahedral GaT sites. 
Especially for GA-HS, the GaT ions percent achieves to 85.5%. It 
indicates that hydrothermal synthesis method promotes the 
formation of tetrahedral GaT ions. Besides, the content of total 
GaT ions is also calculated in combination with bulk content of 
20 
the Ga obtained by ICP-AES. The results show that the content of 
total GaT ions of GA-HS is higher than GA-GM and GA-CP. 
Already published research36, 
37 indicated that the low-
coordinated GaT cations contributed to the activity of Ga2O3- 
containg catalysts for DHP-CO2. And it is consistent with our 
25 
results that the content of GaT cations has a positive relationship 
with 
activity 
of 
Ga2O3-containg 
catalysts 
for 
propane 
dehydrogenation. Propane can heterolytically dissociate on low-
coordinated surface Ga3+ sites in gallium oxide, forming gallium 
hydride and gallium alkoxide species as step (3), and the 
30 
alkoxides then decompose further to the dehydrogenation 
products as step (4) and (5) as follows: 
H-     C3H7
+ 
Ga3+–O2—M3+ + C3H8 → Ga3+–O2−–M3+  (M = Ga, Al)    (3) 
H-    C3H7
+                                      H-         H+ 
35 
Ga3+–O2—M3+ + C3H8 → Ga3+–O2−–M3+ + C3H6                   (4) 
and  
H-      H+                                    
Ga3+–O2—M3+→ Ga3+–O2−–M3+ + H2                               (5) 
When CO2 is introduced into the propane dehydrogenation 
40 
reaction, chemisorbed H2 generates from the step (5) can be 
removed via an alternative route as step (6): 
H-      H+                                    
Ga3+–O2—M3+ + CO2 → Ga3+–O2−–M3+ + CO + H2O    (6) 
 
45 
It’s apparent that the more low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites are 
obtained in the Ga2O3-containg catalysts, the better catalytic 
activity in propane dehydrogenation is. Apart from that, the 
coordination state of the Al3+ ion is also investigated by 27Al 
MAS NMR and the results are shown in Fig. S5 and the 
50 
percentage of Al3+ ions are listed in Table S2. The results suggest 
that the percentage of Al3+ ion in GA-HS is higher than that in 
GA-GM and GA-CP, indicating that hydrothermal synthesis

promotes the formation of more tetrahedral AlT ions as well as 
tetrahedral GaT ions.   
XPS is an effective technique to characterize the surface 
situation of catalysts.47-52 Oxidation states and quantity of the 
5 
elements that are present within the top 1-12 nm of the sample 
surface can be obtained by this technique. The surface Ga/Al 
ratios measured by XPS and the bulk Ga/Al ratios determined by 
ICP-AES are shown in Table 3. The surface Ga/Al ratio of GA-
GM is lower than bulk Ga/Al ratio, while the surface Ga/Al ratios 
10 
of GA-CP and GA-HS are higher than their bulk Ga/Al ratios. 
This indicates that the coprecipitation synthesis and hydrothermal 
synthesis could make more Ga species expose on the surface of 
Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts. This is also verified by SEM-EDS results 
(Fig. S6), which show that the surfaces of GA-CP and GA-HS are 
15 
remarkably enriched in Ga, compared with GA-GM. The Ga 3d 
and Ga 2p1/2 XPS spectra of these catalysts are displayed in Fig. 6. 
From the deconvoluted spectra on the Ga 3d region (Fig. 6A), the 
observation is that only two peaks appear in the spectra of GA-
GM and GA-CP at about 24.1 and 20.6 eV respectively, which 
20 
are assigned to O2s and Ga3+ 3d bands.53 As for GA-HS, a new 
and additional low-energy peak at 19.6 eV is found, which can be 
attributed to the presence of Gaδ+ species (δ< 2),21, 54 suggesting 
that the reduced Ga species are probably generated by the 
hydrothermal synthesis. This can be further verified by Ga 2p1/2 
25 
XPS spectra (Fig. 6B).  It can be seen that the GA-CP and GA-
GM only show one oxidation state, and Ga 2p1/2 binding energy 
(BE) value for GA-CP (1144.6 eV) is higher than that for GA-
GM (1144.2 eV). While GA-HS show two oxidation states 
(1144.2 eV and 1147.9 eV, respectively). It is deduced that the 
30 
other Ga oxidation state (1147.9 eV) ascribed to Gaδ+ species 
probably is formed on GA-HS, due to the surface enrichment of 
Ga species and generation of more low-coordinated GaT species 
by hydrothermal treatment. The dehydrogenation of propane over 
reducible metal oxide catalysts such as chromium and iron oxides 
35 
in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to follow a redox 
mechanism.55 That is, propane is oxidized to propylene with the 
simultaneous reduction of metal oxide (e.g. Fe2O3, Cr2O3), and 
subsequently the reduced metal oxide catalyst is reoxidized by 
CO2. According to the above results, Gaδ+ species (δ< 2) exist in 
40 
our prepared GA-HS and the mentioned redox mechanism is 
probably applicable for the present catalyst system. However, 
compared that the fresh catalyst, the spent GA-HS with or 
without CO2 (Fig. S7A) shows two binding energy peaks in Ga 
3d XPS spectra at about 24.1 eV and 20.8 eV assigned to O2s and 
45 
Ga3+ 3d bands respectively, and yet the original low-energy peak 
at 19.6 eV attributed to the presence of Gaδ+ species (δ< 2) 
disappears. It is deduced that these Gaδ+ species have been 
converted into Ga3+ species probably. This can be also further 
verified by the disappearance of binding energy peak at 1147.9 
50 
eV (ascribed to the Ga oxidation state) in Ga 2p1/2 XPS spectra 
(Fig. S7B) after reaction with or without CO2. Compared with 
fresh GA-HS, oxidation states in the spent GA-HS with CO2 are 
similar to that without CO2, implying that the redox mechanism in 
which the CO2 is taken as an oxidant is not available for the 
55 
present catalyst. However, CO2 still plays a positive role in the 
enhancement of dehydrogenation activity through reverse water-
gas shift reaction and elimination of coke by Boudouard 
reaction.37 The reduced gallium ions (Gaδ+ species δ< 2) are also 
thought to have high dehydrogenation efficiency. The gallium-
60 
hydrogen bond can be formed on these reduced gallium ions by 
heterolytic hydrogen dissociation, and can be stabilized on the 
support surface.21 Therefore, dehydrogenation proceeds on the 
supported gallium oxide catalysts probably through a heterolytic 
dissociation reaction pathway instead of redox mechanism. 
65 
Wherein, it should be pointed out that the further work needs to 
be done to clarify the mechanism of conversion of Gaδ+ species 
(δ< 2) to Ga3+ species with and without CO2.  
3.4 Morphologies of as-prepared samples 
In order to reveal the morphologies of these as-prepared samples, 
70 
TEM is applied and the results are shown in Fig. 7. Al2O3 shows 
smooth pieces (Fig. 7a) while Ga2O3 takes on an irregular and 
segregated morphology (Fig. 7b). GA-GM as shown in Fig. 7c 
mainly contains two kinds of morphologies. Wherein, it is 
thought that they are ascribed to Ga2O3 and Al2O3 respectively, in 
75 
combination with Fig. 7a, 7b. While GA-CP (Fig. 7d) just 
exhibits a unified distinct sponge-like morphology probably 
ascribed to gallia-alumina solid solution (cubic spinel-type 
structure) inferred from the XRD results that gallia-alumina solid 
solution (cubic spinel-type structure) is generated. In case of GA-
80 
HS, besides amorphous sponge-like morphology like GA-CP as 
shown in Fig. 7d, an additional morphology (Fig. 7e) that some 
pieces are covered with amorphous nanoparticles is also seen. 
Furthermore, some amorphous nanoparticles can embed into 
these pieces (Fig. 7f). It’s easily understandable that the distinct 
85 
multiple morphologies of these samples are ascribed to their 
different structures, which are determined by preparation method 
and treatment process.  
3.5 Acidity of the catalysts 
A comparison of the DRIFT spectra in the OH stretching region 
90 
for the as-prepared samples is showed in Fig. 8. The stretching 
band of Ga-OH groups for Ga2O3 and Al-OH for Al2O3 are 
located at 3650 cm-1 and 3716 cm-1 respectively. As for GA-GM, 
no any stretching bands of Al-OH groups or Ga-OH groups are 
observed but only a broad region, probably because of the 
95 
formation of disordered mixture between Al2O3 and Ga2O3. GA-
CP and GA-HS both show a new stretching band of special group 
at about 3683 cm-1, which is assigned to Ga-OH or Al-OH in the 
cubic spinel-type structure. The appearance of the new OH group 
somewhat affects the acidity of catalyst. Based on that, the 
100 
distribution of acidity on these different catalysts is measured by 
NH3-TPD and the profiles are shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that 
there is only one NH3 desorption peak over these catalysts. The  
desorption peak on GA-HS shows an obvious shift to higher 
temperature (315 °C) in comparison with that on GA-GM 
105 
(284 °C) and GA-CP (303 °C), meaning that the acidity strength 
of the GA-HS is enhanced facilely via the hydrothermal synthesis 
and the medium-strong Lewis acid sites are generated on the 
catalyst accordingly. Moreover, the increased number of Lewis 
acid sites over GA-HS, in comparison of GA-CP and GA-GM 
110 
(Table 3), implies that the hydrothermal synthesis promotes the 
formation of medium-strong Lewis acid sites. It has been proved 
that the dehydrogenation of propane proceeded mainly on the

Lewis acid sites related to low-coordinated Ga3+ ions on Ga2O3–
containing catalysts, which affected intensively their activities for 
dehydrogenation of propane.12, 56 It’s apparently plausible that 
20 
large amount of Lewis acid sites over GA-HS play a key role in 
improving the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation.  
Apart from the acidity number and acidity strength of active 
sites over these catalysts, the acidity type also contributes to their 
catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. Based on 
25 
that, FTIR spectra of pyridine adsorption on different catalysts 
are recorded to identify the Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid 
sites, and the results are shown in Fig. 10. two peaks, at 1458 cm-
1 and 1620 cm-1 respectively, appear over all these catalysts, 
which are assigned to Lewis acid sites.44, 57 That’s to say, only 
30 
Lewis acid sites exist on these Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts. In view of 
NH3-TPD profiles, it is deduced that the desorbed NH3 arise from 
Lewis acid sites. And these Lewis acid sites are related to 
coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ ions in the tetrahedral position.57 
It’s apparent that GA-HS possesses more Ga3+ ions in the 
35 
tetrahedral sites than GA-GM and GA-CP because of more 
number of Lewis acid sites on GA-HS inferred from by NH3-TPD, 
thereby showing better catalytic performance substantially. This 
result is consistent with the NMR results. 
Chen et al.11, 12 reported that surface acidity (specifically 
40 
Lewis acid sites density of surface) on the Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts 
is crucial to obtain high activity and stability in propane 
dehydrogenation. Wherein, the surface acidity is attributed to the 
surface tetrahedral Ga3+ ions. Therefore, the investigation to 
surface tetrahedral Ga3+ sites is helpful to understand the propane 
45 
dehydrogenation in-deep. As proposed, propane activation firstly

proceeds on these low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, forming propyl-
Ga species, and then the dehydrogenation products are generated 
by subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-Ga species. 
In our work, a positive correlation between the number of Ga 
species in tetrahedral sites and the number of surface Lewis acid 
5 
sites on GA-HS further verifies the previous work.12  
3.6 Pulsed reaction 
To gain more insight into the mechanism of DHP-CO2 over the 
different catalysts, a pulsed reaction technique is used to measure 
the activities of these catalysts.13 The transient responses over as-
10 
prepared catalysts against a pulsed introduction of C3H8 at 550°C 
under steady flow of mixture gas (10% CO2 and 90% Ar) are 
tested by an on-line mass spectrometer as well as the contrast 
tests, and the results are shown in Fig. 11.  When C3H8 is pulsely 
introduced under steady flow of pure Ar, similar narrow and 
15 
positive peaks with the transient response of m/z= 44 (C3H8) over 
all these catalysts (Fig. S8) can be seen. Besides, the transient 
response of m/z= 43 determined as C3H8 also can be noticed.58, 59 
When steady flow is introduced with 10% CO2, the peak 
responses of m/z = 43 and m/z = 44 over theses catalysts are 
20 
obviously different. The transient response of m/z= 43 over GA-
GM, GA-CP and GA-HS are all similar and present as narrow 
peaks (Fig. S9), suggesting that C3H8 is detected over these 
catalysts.. In case of the responses of m/z = 44 over GA-HS, the 
inverted peaks apparently indicate that the introduced C3H8 and 
25 
CO2 has been consumed greatly (Fig. 11c). Whereas, the narrow 
and positive peaks of GA-CP imply that the remarkable amount 
of C3H8 feedstock is still reserved (Fig. 11b). The largest broad 
and positive peaks of the transient response (m/z = 44) over GA-
GM (Fig. 11a), indicate the weak conversion of C3H8. 
30 
Conclusively, the above results suggest that activity of GA-HS 
for DHP-CO2 is higher than that over other catalysts, which 
agrees with the previous test results.  
Reported work60-63 has shown that hydrothermal conditions 
(generated self-pressure, hydrothermal temperature and time) had 
35 
great influence on the crystallization and formation process of the 
catalysts. In this work, the characterization data suggested that 
hydrothermal conditions such as generated self-pressure, 
hydrothermal temperature and time (170 °C for 24 h) played 
significant roles in improving the dispersion and distribution of 
40 
surface gallium sites. Through the hydrothermal process, more 
tetrahedral Ga3+ sites gallium sites were exposed on the surface of 
GA-HS, thus contributing to formation of surface Lewis acid sites. 
Moreover, this hydrothermal treatment is also favorable for 
improving surface area and increasing pore volume of the 
45 
catalyst. It’s the superior structure and physical properties 
obtained by hydrothermal synthesis that ultimately result in high 
activity for dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, it can be 
concluded apparently that hydrothermal synthesis is quite an 
effective method to obtain an efficient Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst for 
50 
propane dehydrogenation. 
4. Conclusion remarks 
A Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalyst (GA-HS) prepared using hydrothermal 
synthesis method showed prominent activity for the DHP-CO2. 
The highest propane conversion achieved on GA-HS catalyst was 
55 
35.2%, which was much higher than that of GA-GM (8.7%) 
prepared using grind-mixture method and GA-CP (26.2%) 
prepared using coprecipitation method. Furthermore, the 
propylene selectivity over GA-HS was highest among these 
catalysts during the whole reaction time. On the other hand, 
60 
propane conversion and propylene selectivity as a function of 
time on stream on regenerated GA-HS with CO2 are some low in 
comparison with that on fresh GA-HS, implying that the coke can 
be partly eliminated with CO2 through Boudouard reaction. 
Besides, the introduction of CO2 to this reaction system improved 
65 
durability of the catalysts in spite of the decreased initial 
conversions of propane on these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts. 
Characterization results such as BET, XPS, etc. suggested that 
hydrothermal conditions such as generated self-pressure, 
hydrothermal temperature and time (170 °C for 24 h) played 
70 
significant roles in improving the dispersion and distribution of 
surface gallium sites. This process made more tetrahedral Ga3+ 
sites expose on the surface of GA-HS, which contributed to 
formation of surface 
Lewis acid sites. Moreover, the 
hydrothermal treatment is favorable for improving surface area 
75 
and increasing pore volume of the catalyst. The texture of GA-HS 
was largely recovered with air regeneration even after 9 h 
reaction time well. Higher surface area and larger amount of 
tetrahedral Ga ions (Ga3+ and probably Gaδ+) related to strong 
Lewis acid sites were responsible for the superior activity of GA-
80 
HS catalyst. The correlative work about generation and effect of 
Gaδ+ ions are still on-going.
