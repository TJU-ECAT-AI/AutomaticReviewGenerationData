The effect of sulfate species in propane dehydrogenation over Co/Al2O3 catalysts was studied. On the one hand,
the interaction between SO4
2−and cobalt species leads to better dispersed cobalt oxide and restrains the reduc-
tion to metallic Co species, thereby inhibiting cracking reaction. On the other hand, the initial C–H bond activation
and scission are facilitated on the electron-deﬁcient cobalt and sulfate sites, resulting in dramatically improved
dehydrogenation performance. XPS, MS and XRD results show that the reduction of sulfate species to SO2 and
consequently the loss of active cobalt species contribute to the irreversible deactivation of catalyst.

1. Introduction
Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is an excellent way to convert
cheaper and available propane into high value-added propylene. Cur-
rently, most researchers are focused on commercial Cr-based [1–3]
and Pt-based [4–6] catalysts. However, due to the serious pollution of
Cr6+ and the high cost of Pt, their applications are largely restricted. Be-
sides, Pt-promoted Ga/Al2O3 [7], Zn-MOR [8] and HNO3-activated meso-
porous carbon [9] catalytic systems are reported to be promising
catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. Nevertheless, little attention
has been paid to the application of cobalt-supported catalysts.
Cobalt-based catalysts are known to be efﬁcient in many reactions
such as F–T synthesis [10,11] and partial oxidation of alkanes [12,13].
Freas and Campana [14] reported that the terminal cobalt atoms of
oxygen-deﬁcient cobalt cluster ions can insert into hydrocarbon bonds
and catalyze the dehydrogenation of isobutene in the gas phase. Fur-
thermore, van Koppen et al. [15] investigated the reaction of Co+ with
propane, proposing that C–H activation only occurs on the surface of
ground state Co+ ions while C–C activation is prone to occur on the sur-
face of excited-state Co+ ions, consequently, dehydrogenation reaction
and cracking reaction proceed respectively. Despite the great difference
between the homogeneous gas-phase reaction and the heterogeneous
gas–solid reaction, these ﬁndings provide deep insight into the nature
of dehydrogenation reaction.
According to our previous experiment results, the breakage of C–C
bond occurred preferentially in propane dehydrogenation over Co/
Al2O3 catalysts with high loadings of Co3O4 (above 10 wt.%), generating
abundant methane. Therefore, great effort should be made to achieve
higher selectivity of propylene. In previous studies, we found that the
introduction of sulfate to Ni-based [16] and Fe-based [17] catalysts dra-
matically inhibited cracking reaction and improved the selectivity of al-
kenes in alkane dehydrogenation, eg: up to 20 wt.% propylene yield
with 80% selectivity were obtained over Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts [17].
Herein, in this paper, sulfate species were introduced to Co/Al2O3
catalyst with 20 wt.% loading of Co3O4 by the impregnation of ammoni-
um sulfate. The effect of sulfate addition on the structural and electronic
properties of Co/Al2O3 catalyst was investigated and correlated with the
catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. Finally, the reasons
for the catalyst deactivation were also discussed.

of 50 wt.% was observed. Besides, a large amount of oxidation product
COx (16.6 wt.% yield) was detected, suggesting that the oxidative reac-
tion predominates in the initial stage. After 1 h, propane conversion in-
creased to almost 100 wt.% while methane yield to 92 wt.% without the
formation of propylene. Meanwhile, the yield of COx decreased to 0.8
wt.%, indicating a fast consumption of surface oxygen species. Thus, it
is concluded that the dramatically enhanced cracking reaction is proba-
bly resulted from the changes in cobalt species during the reaction,
hence generating abundant methane.
In order to get more information about the changes in cobalt species
during the reaction, XRD characterization of fresh and spent 20Co/Al,
which exhibited high cracking activity was carried out and shown in
Fig. 2. As for fresh 20Co/Al, diffraction peaks centered at 2θ 31.2, 36.8,
59.3 and 65.2 indicative of Co3O4 consistent with reported values
(JCDPS 01-081-1543) were observed, which disappeared after reaction
and accompanied by the appearance of metallic Co phase. As reported in
literature [18], metallic Co species were very active in C–C rupture
through catalyzing the hydrogenolysis of alkanes. Therefore, it is de-
duced that as the reaction proceeded, Co3O4 was reduced to metallic
Co species in the presence of generated hydrogen, resulting in dramat-
ically increased yield and selectivity of methane.
Compared with 20Co/Al, 20Co–5S/Al showed a much lower initial
propane conversion of about 22 wt.%. With prolonged reaction time,
both propane conversion and propylene yield increased in the ﬁrst 2 h,
eg: 22.4 wt.% propylene yield and 80% selectivity were obtained at TOS
(time on stream) = 2 h. Though the activity is lower than that reported
for Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts, the catalyst is environment-friendly
compared with Cr-based catalysts and cheaper than Pt-based catalysts.
Moreover, the yield of methane was maintained at a rather low level
during the investigated 6 h, TG–DTA results also showed that the carbon
deposition for 20Co/Al after reaction for 6 h was 482 mg/gcat while that of
20Co–5S/Al was 91 mg/gcat, demonstrating that the cracking reaction is
effectively inhibited with sulfate addition. Furthermore, the reaction
was performed at 600 °C using 3 g of 20Co–5S/Al to get an identical con-
version (Fig. 1(c)). At TOS = 2 h, propane conversion increased to 50 wt.%
with propylene selectivity to 70.2%, which is much higher than that over
20Co/Al (TOS = 0.16 h), demonstrating the improved catalytic perfor-
mance with sulfate addition. Based on these results, it is concluded that
sulfate addition signiﬁcantly altered the reaction route over 20Co/Al cata-
lyst, turning dehydrogenation reaction into the predominant reaction. For
detailed elaboration, we will discuss it in the following sections.
3.2. The role of sulfate species
Based on the above results, it is concluded that the metallic Co
species generated from the reduction of Co3O4 during the reaction are
the active sites for cracking reaction over 20Co/Al catalyst. Whereas
the introduction of sulfate species dramatically inhibits the cracking re-
action and promotes propane dehydrogenation, leading to much higher
yield and selectivity of propylene. Thus, it is of great interest to explore
the origin of the promoting effect of sulfate species.
3.2.1. Dispersion effect
As shown in Fig. 2, the XRD pattern of 20Co–5S/Al was very similar
to that of 20Co/Al, predominantly exhibiting diffraction lines corre-
sponding to Co3O4 with weaker intensity, suggesting that sulfate addi-
tion effectively suppresses the aggregation of cobalt oxide, which is
consistent with the increased surface area (from 111.3 to 121.0 m2/g)
and decreased average size (from 49.5 nm to 35.6 nm) of Co3O4 crystals
calculated from the (311) line using Scherrer equation (Table S1). The
SEM images (Fig. 3) of the catalysts using the oxide precursors also
showed that after the introduction of sulfate species, the relatively
large catalyst particles (300–400 nm) were divided into small particles
of about 100 nm, further verifying that sulfate addition effectively pre-
vents the formation of large ensembles of cobalt metals which cause un-
desirable cracking reaction.

T = 600 °C, P = 0.1 MPa, m cat = 3 g, FC3H8 = 12 mL/min).

In order to further authenticate above speculations, 20Co/Al and
20Co–5S/Al were reduced in hydrogen at 560 °C for 2 h before reaction
and the reaction results were displayed in Fig. S1. As expected, propane
was converted to methane without the formation of propylene over re-
duced 20Co/Al, meanwhile, much higher propane conversion of 99 wt.%
was obtained. According to XRD results, obvious diffraction peaks char-
acteristic of metallic Co species were observed for reduced 20Co/Al,
demonstrating the high cracking activity of metallic Co species. In com-
parison, propylene was still the main product with the formation of a
small amount of methane during the investigated 6 h over reduced
20Co–5S/Al. Besides, no diffraction lines of metallic Co were detected,
conﬁrming that sulfate addition signiﬁcantly restrains the reduction of
Co3O4 to metallic Co species.
3.2.2. Effect on the acidity and electronic properties
As discussed above, sulfate addition not only improves the disper-
sion of cobalt species but also strongly inhibits the reduction to large
metallic Co particles, resulting in the transformation from cracking reac-
tion to dehydrogenation reaction. To get a deeper understanding of the
favorable interaction, IR, H2-TPR and XPS measurements were carried
out.
The FT-IR spectra of Al2O3 and 20Co/Al only exhibited a strong band at
around 1450 cm−1 attributed to the chemisorption of pyridine on Lewis
acid sites [19]. After sulfate addition, Bronsted acid sites represented by
the absorption band at 1540 cm−1 appeared, meanwhile, the intensity
of the band at 1490 cm−1 indicative of the total amount of acid signiﬁ-
cantly increased, suggesting an enhanced acidity, which is supposed to
be responsible for the improved dehydrogenation performance.
Fig. 4 showed the Co 2p spectra of all samples. As for 20Co/Al, the Co
2p peak located at 779.6 eV with an associated satellite peak at 785.8 eV,
ascribing to the presence of Co3O4 [20,21]. After sulfate addition, the
band position shifted to higher binding energy (780.2 eV), indicating
an electron transfer from Co atoms, which can be attributed to the
strong electron-withdrawing ability of SO4
2- as evidenced by the S 2p
peak centered at around 169.3 eV (Fig. S2) [22]. On the basis of afore-
mentioned results, it is concluded that the impregnation of alumina by
ammonium sulfate signiﬁcantly improved the interaction between the
Co precursor and the support, leading to increased cobalt dispersion
and enhanced acidity. That is, the generated sulfate species interact
with Co atoms via Co–O–S bond and confer on Co atoms at electron-
efﬁcient state. For one thing, the Co–O bonds are strengthened and
make the reduction to metallic Co species more difﬁcult, consequently,
inhibiting the cracking reaction. This can be further veriﬁed by the H2-
TPR results as shown in Fig. S4. 20Co/Al mainly exhibited two reduction
peaks centered at about 520 °C and 580 °C, which were attributed to the
reduction process of Co3O4 →Co2+ and Co2+ →Co. After sulfate addi-
tion, only one peak in the range of 500–600 °C ascribing to the reduction
from Co3O4 to Co2+ was observed, demonstrating above speculations.
For another, the initial C–H scission was facilitated at the sulfate site in
a manner similar to that proposed by Burch et al. for propane activation
over Pt/Al2O3 catalysts [23,24], forming C3H7
+ and H−which will inter-
act with CoLC
n+ and OLC
2−(LC denotes low coordination) respectively. Ac-
cording to this mechanism, the lower coordinated Co sites (probably
Co2+) are in favor of propane dehydrogenation, agreeing with the
observed “induction period” of activity over 20Co–5S/Al.
All in all, the sulfate addition to 20Co/Al catalyst exerts a dispersion
effect and obviously improves both the acidity and electronic proper-
ties. In this regard, the reduction to large metallic cobalt species which
are responsible for cracking reaction is strongly inhibited, meanwhile,
C–H bond activation and subsequent rupture are facilitated, leading to
higher propylene yield and selectivity.
3.3. Catalyst deactivation
Fig. S5 exhibited the reaction results over 20Co–5S/Al catalyst during
the ﬁve reaction–regeneration cycles. The activity gradually decreased
with increased cycles, eg: after ﬁve cycles, only 14.8 wt.% propylene
yield was retained at a conversion of 19.4 wt.%, suggesting that in addi-
tion to carbon deposition, there are other reasons for the irreversible de-
activation of catalyst.
According to XPS results (Table S2), the sulfur content of 20Co–5S/Al
(Table S2) decreased from 2.0 wt.% to 1.0 wt.% after ﬁve cycles, suggest-
ing a loss of sulfate species. Fig. 5 also showed that the content of SO2
during the reaction–regeneration cycles dramatically decreased,

conﬁrming the reduction of sulfate species and release in the form of
SO2. Besides, the intensity of Co3O4 signiﬁcantly decreased after ﬁve cy-
cles (Fig. 2). Combining with the decreased surface molar ratio of Co/Al,
it is concluded that with the loss of sulfate species and consequently
weakened Co–O–S bond, active cobalt ions may migrate and incorpo-
rate into the octahedral sites of alumina, causing the formation of
CoAl2O4-like phase as evidenced the Co 2p peak at around 781 eV [25]
and thus the decreased activity. Besides, though the activity decreased
gradually with prolonged reaction time in each cycle, the selectivity of
propylene exhibited little changes, suggesting that the loss of sulfate
species does not change the reaction route over 20Co–5S/Al.
4. Conclusions
The effect of sulfate addition on the performance of Co/Al2O3 cata-
lysts in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane was studied. It is found
that the generated sulfate species improve the dispersion, acidity and
electronic properties of cobalt species. The dispersion effect restrains
the aggregation of cobalt oxide and the reduction to metallic Co species,
thus inhibiting the cracking reaction. Meanwhile, the electronic effect
facilitates C–H bond activation and scission, leading to signiﬁcantly
improved dehydrogenation performance. However, the reduction of
SO4
2−to SO2 and thus the loss of active cobalt species contribute to the
irreversible deactivation of catalyst. These ﬁndings can help to improve
the dehydrogenation performance of cobalt-based catalysts by intro-
ducing electron-withdrawing promoters and increasing the dispersion
of cobalt species.
