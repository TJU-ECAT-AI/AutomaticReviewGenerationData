Europium Oxybromide Catalysts for Efficient Bromine Looping in Natural Gas Valorization
Graphical Abstract
Mind the gap: Europium-oxybromide-based materials are extraordinary catalysts for both HBr oxidation to Br2 and CH4 oxybromination to CH3Br. This enables a closed bromine loop for the sustainable upgrading of natural gas to fuels and chemicals.
Abstract
The industrialization of bromine-mediated natural gas upgrading is contingent on the ability to fully recycle hydrogen bromide (HBr), which is the end form of the halogen after the activation and coupling of the alkanes. Europium oxybromide (EuOBr) is introduced as a unique catalytic material to close the bromine loop via HBr oxidation, permitting low-temperature operation and long lifetimes with a stoichiometric feed (O2:HBr=0.25)—conditions at which any catalyst reported to date severely deactivates because of excessive bromination. Besides, EuOBr exhibits unparalleled selectivity to methyl bromide in methane oxybromination, which is an alternative route for bromine looping. This novel active phase is finely dispersed on appropriate carriers and scaled up to technical extrudates, enhancing the utilization of the europium phase while preserving the performance. This catalytic system paves the way for sustainable valorization of stranded natural gas via bromine chemistry.
More than 30 % of the known world's natural gas reserves are located in remote and scattered wells.1 This fact precludes their use as a long-lasting feedstock for the manufacture of chemicals and fuels because of prohibitively expensive shipping to centralized megaplants.2 Consequently, natural gas emitted from these wells is nowadays flared or vented, wasting approximately 3.5 % of global production, which is a fraction worth 13 billion USD.3 Among the various routes proposed to overcome the capital intensiveness of conventional syngas-based processes,4 the bromine-mediated functionalization of methane into methyl bromide (CH3Br), a versatile C1 platform molecule with similar upgrading paths to methanol, has emerged as an attractive technology for the manufacture of readily transportable value-added chemicals and fuels in compact plants amenable to decentralization.2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Key steps of the process (Figure 1; Supporting Information, Figure S1),2, 6, 7, 8, 9 which could also be applied to ethane and propane,2 comprise 1) methane bromination, which provides up to 95 % selectivity to CH3Br, 2) reproportionation of the polybrominated byproducts into monobrominated alkanes and olefins by reaction with C1–C5 alkanes, 3) coupling of CH3Br and reproportionation products into valuable hydrocarbons such as gasolines, olefins, and aromatics, and 4) recycling of hydrogen bromide (HBr), which is generated in stoichiometric amounts in the bromination and coupling steps. The latter step closes the bromine loop and is vital to the feasibility of the entire technology, since the high price and low availability of this halogen necessitate its full recovery. The highly efficient carbon atom utilization enabled by developments in the bromination, reproportionation, and coupling reactions, as well as advances in corrosion resistant construction materials, led to a large-scale demonstration of the bromine-based process for the production of petrochemical-grade aromatics from methane, which is nowadays offered for licensing.2, 10 Nevertheless, limited progress has been made towards sustainable bromine looping, which is commonly accomplished via cataloreactant processes or the catalytic HBr oxidation.2, 8, 11 The former approach relies on the absorption of HBr by an oxide or hydroxide, followed by its reoxidation in a second step to evolve bromine. Such a cyclic operation necessitates large reactors and is challenging to control because of the finite lifetime of the cataloreactants. Hence, it is highly desirable to develop a catalytic system for the continuous oxidation of HBr into molecular bromine at relatively low temperatures (T≤573 K) and a stoichiometric feed (O2:HBr=0.25). In addition to enhancing the overall space–time and energy efficiency of the process, this would enable the use of air as an oxygen source, thereby substantially reducing production costs. Nevertheless, such an operating window remains highly challenging because of the extensive bromination of active catalysts such as RuO2 and CeO2 (even under significant oxygen excess), leading to severe deactivation.11c,11d

In our quest for a novel catalytically active phase that enables efficient bromine looping, we have investigated the performance of various rare-earth oxides, including La2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, Gd2O3, Tb2O3, and Dy2O3, in HBr oxidation. Catalysts based on lanthanide metals have been widely applied in numerous reactions,12 but apart from CeO2, no member of this catalyst family has been investigated in HBr oxidation. Initial catalytic tests were conducted using an oxygen-rich feed (O2:HBr=2), which favors the reoxidation of the catalyst (Supporting Information, Figure S4).11c,11d All of the catalysts were found to transform to the oxybromide phase under these conditions (Supporting Information, Figure S3). Consequently, the performance of the lanthanide oxybromide (LnOBr) phases was considered. Comparatively, the highest rates of HBr oxidation in the low-temperature window (423–473 K) were observed over EuOBr, substantially exceeding those of the benchmark CeO2 and TiO2 catalysts (Figure 2 a; Supporting Information, Figure S4). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the application of EuOBr in catalysis. The light-off curve of LaOBr shifted to an approximately 150 K higher temperature compared to EuOBr; moreover, the former catalyst suffered deactivation (Supporting Information, Figure S4). Oxybromides of other lanthanides were all active at temperatures greater than 623 K, which exceeded the preferred operating window.

Conditions: HBr:O2:He=4.5:1.13–19:94.37–86.5, space velocity, FT/Wcat=200 cm3 min−1 gcat−1, P=1 bar.
The performance of EuOBr remained unaltered upon temperature cycling (Figure 2 a), which simulates the likely spatial and temporal fluctuations in a reactor. In contrast, during the temperature-increasing part of the cycle, CeO2 displayed a lower HBr conversion than during the temperature-decreasing part, indicating that deactivation is likely caused by the high bromine uptake at low temperatures.11c,11d On the other hand, TiO2, which is the benchmark of the bromination-resistant catalysts,11b,11d was less active compared to EuOBr. The stability of the latter material was also evident on cycling of the feed concentration of oxygen (Figure 2 b). Notably, the performance of EuOBr was only slightly affected by the oxygen concentration, showing no deactivation. Contrarily, the conversion of HBr over CeO2 drops to almost zero under the preferred stoichiometric feed (O2:HBr=0.25), and is only partially recovered upon returning to higher oxygen concentrations. The outstanding robustness of EuOBr was further demonstrated by its stable activity in a time-on-stream test under a stoichiometric feed at 523 K (Figure 2 c). Under the same conditions, the bromine production over CeO2 almost completely ceased just after 6 h. The deactivation profiles of this material observed upon temperature and oxygen cycling, as well as with time-on-stream coincide with the behavior of other highly active catalysts in this reaction, such as RuO2.11c,11d
The contrasting performance of EuOBr and CeO2 was rationalized by in-depth characterization of the catalysts recovered after different periods of time-on-stream in HBr oxidation. The appearance of new reflections in the X-ray diffraction patterns of the used samples indicated a chemical transformation of CeO2 (Figure 2 d); based on the increasing degree of bromination (see proceeding text), this was tentatively ascribed to the formation of (oxy)bromide phases (Supporting Information, Figure S6). Furthermore, pronounced particle sintering was revealed by a drop in surface area of the catalyst recovered after 6 h of reaction (13 m2 g−1) with respect to the fresh material (27 m2 g−1), which was also supported by electron microscopy examination (Supporting Information, Figure S7). Remarkably, the bulk structure of EuOBr showed no significant change after 20 h of use (Figure 2 d; Supporting Information, Figure S7), although its surface area (19 m2 g−1) was slightly decreased compared to the fresh catalyst (22 m2 g−1). The profound resistance of EuOBr to further bromination, and the progressive uptake of bromine by CeO2, are supported by the elemental maps obtained using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX; Figure 2 e; Supporting Information, Figure S7), and thermogravimetric analysis (Supporting Information, Figure S8). Inspection of the fresh and used CeO2 by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further demonstrated the increase of bromine content in the surface region of this catalyst upon use (Figure 2 f), leading to its reduction (Supporting Information, Figure S9), ultimately resulting in its deactivation (Figure 2 c). On the other hand, EuOBr displayed a constant Br:Eu ratio of about 0.7 in the surface region (Figure 2 f), indicating that the surface of the catalyst remains rich in oxygen under a stoichiometric feed. Europium was found to predominantly exist as Eu3+ with a minor contribution of Eu2+ (Supporting Information, Figure S10), suggesting the Eu3+/Eu2+ redox couple is responsible for the catalyst's activity. Based on these results, the exceptional stability of EuOBr can be ascribed to its structural integrity, which is preserved in oxygen- and HBr-rich feed mixtures.
Given the outstanding performance of EuOBr in HBr oxidation, the material was further evaluated in methane oxybromination (MOB), which is an alternative option that accomplishes continuous bromine looping by integrating HBr oxidation and methane functionalization in a single step (Figure 1; Supporting Information, Figure S1).13 Besides stability and activity constraints, a major challenge in the design of a MOB catalyst is to attain a high selectivity to CH3Br by suppressing the side combustion reactions.13 The latter are avoided if methane bromination and HBr oxidation are conducted separately, which favors the two-step route over MOB. Notably, the selectivity to CH3Br over EuOBr (85–65 % at 6–33 % single-pass methane conversion) substantially exceeded that of the benchmark (VO)2P2O7 (VPO) and CeO2 catalysts at comparable reaction rates in the broad range of conditions applied (Figure 3; Supporting Information, Figure S11).13 EuOBr also provided the highest selectivity to CH3Br (7–56 %) and CH2Br2 (2–30 %) on the basis of HBr (51–95 % single-pass conversion), although the selectivity to bromine (17–90 %) was significant (Supporting Information, Figure S12). Moreover, EuOBr exhibited a low formation of carbon oxides (COx), yielding bromine and dibromomethane (CH2Br2) as the dominant byproducts, which can be further upgraded via bromination and reproportionation, respectively (Figure 1; Supporting Information, Figure S1).2, 6, 9

Conditions: CH4:HBr:O2:Ar:He=6:6:3:4.5:80.5, FT/Wcat=100 cm3 min−1 gcat−1, P=1 bar. Legend in (a) also applies to (b).
To rationalize the activity of EuOBr in MOB, the catalyst was evaluated in methane combustion and methane bromination (Supporting Information, Figure S13), which were chosen as the test reactions to probe the catalyst's ability to dissociate C−H and form C−Br bonds, respectively. The low activity in methane combustion and absence of a catalytic effect in methane bromination, suggest a low propensity of this material to activate this alkane. Moreover, MOB over EuOBr proceeds in the same temperature window (T>733 K) as the non-catalytic gas-phase bromination of methane, whereby the two reactions exhibit almost identical apparent activation energies (Supporting Information, Figure S13). It is thus proposed that MOB proceeds by the gas-phase reaction of methane with molecular bromine that is (re)generated by HBr oxidation on EuOBr.13b,13c
Having identified the outstanding properties of EuOBr in HBr oxidation and MOB, the next step was to develop a ready-to-use technical catalyst based on this material. Besides reducing the price of a catalyst, the dispersion of an active phase over a suitable carrier can improve the intrinsic activity by ensuring both a high surface area and favorable electronic interaction. To study the potential impact of active phase dispersion, EuOBr was supported on three carriers: Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2 (9 wt % Eu) yielding catalysts denoted as EuOBr/Al2O3, EuOBr/ZrO2, and EuOBr/SiO2, respectively. These were evaluated in HBr oxidation revealing the following activity trend: EuOBr/Al2O3 > EuOBr/ZrO2 > EuOBr/SiO2 (Figure 4 a). Notably, the conversion of HBr over EuOBr/Al2O3 substantially exceeded that of the bulk system in the low-temperature region; that is, enabling an over one order of magnitude higher rate of HBr oxidation per content of europium, while preserving its resistance against bromination (Supporting Information, Figure S13). Characterization of the fresh and used samples revealed an atomic level dispersion of europium over all supported catalysts (Figure 5; Supporting Information, Figures S15 and S16). The specific surface area of the best performing EuOBr/Al2O3 was intermediate between that of EuOBr/ZrO2 and EuOBr/SiO2 (Supporting Information, Table S3), suggesting that the observed activity trend is also affected by the specific interaction with the support. On the other hand, the degree of bromination, ability to evolve bromine, and reducibility of the supported catalysts, (which all decrease in the order: EuOBr/Al2O3 > EuOBr/ZrO2 ≫ EuOBr/SiO2; Supporting Information, Figures S16, S17, and S18), strongly correlate with the activity in HBr oxidation. This confirms the impact of the carrier identity on the susceptibility to bromination, whereby the supported systems with a bromine content close to that of the oxybromide display a higher activity in HBr oxidation. The outstanding performance of EuOBr/Al2O3 was thus rationalized by the ability of Al2O3 to stabilize the brominated form of the catalyst and to promote the bromine evolution with respect to the bulk system.

In the case of MOB, the supported systems led to an increased production of COx with respect to bulk EuOBr (Figure 3; Supporting Information, Figure S19). This was particularly pronounced over EuOBr/Al2O3, which could be attributed to its high oxidizing potential (Supporting Information, Figure S18) as well as the propensity of Al2O3 to combust halocarbons.14 On the other hand, an enhanced COx formation over EuOBr/SiO2 is consistent with the low degree of catalyst bromination, which promotes combustion.13c EuOBr/ZrO2 shows balanced redox properties and a relatively high degree of bromination, providing the highest selectivity to CH3Br among the supported systems, which is close to that of the bulk EuOBr and is also preserved at lower europium loading (Supporting Information, Figure S20).
Based on the relative performance of the supported systems, Al2O3 and ZrO2 extrudates were chosen to prepare technical catalysts (EuOBr/Al2O3-t and EuOBr/ZrO2-t), which were tested in low-temperature HBr oxidation and MOB under stoichiometric, and substoichiometric feeds, respectively. The activities of EuOBr/Al2O3-t and EuOBr/ZrO2-t matched that of the supported systems in powder form and were stable for over 60 h of operation under the harsh conditions (Figure 4 b,c) with no detectable loss of europium.
In conclusion, EuOBr was found to be an exceptional catalyst for HBr oxidation, enabling low-temperature operation under a stoichiometric feed, and in conditions inaccessible to existing systems. This was ascribed to the marked bromine evolution activity and inherent resistance to further bromination of the oxybromide phase. Moreover, this material provided a high selectivity to CH3Br in MOB, outperforming all previously reported catalysts. The substantially suppressed COx production over EuOBr opens the door for the development of catalytic systems that do not produce COx side products. Thereby, the conversion of CH2Br2 via reproportionation could further enhance the overall selectivity to CH3Br. To bridge the gap between the activity of EuOBr in bromine recovery processes and its high price, the impact of different carriers on EuOBr performance was investigated. Al2O3 and ZrO2 were identified as the best supports for HBr oxidation and MOB, respectively, enabling an order of magnitude improved utilization of europium compared to the bulk catalyst. Catalysts in technical form prepared using Al2O3 and ZrO2 supports displayed robust performance, thus demonstrating a realistic potential for application in bromine-based processes that can enable the decentralized valorization of stranded natural gas.

In our quest for a novel catalytically active phase that enables efficient bromine looping, we have investigated the performance of various rare-earth oxides, including La2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, Gd2O3, Tb2O3, and Dy2O3, in HBr oxidation.

Conditions: HBr:O2:He=4.5:1.13–19:94.37–86.5, space velocity, FT/Wcat=200 cm3 min−1 gcat−1, P=1 bar.
The performance of EuOBr remained unaltered upon temperature cycling (Figure 2 a), which simulates the likely spatial and temporal fluctuations in a reactor. In contrast, during the temperature-increasing part of the cycle, CeO2 displayed a lower HBr conversion than during the temperature-decreasing part, indicating that deactivation is likely caused by the high bromine uptake at low temperatures.11c,11d On the other hand, TiO2, which is the benchmark of the bromination-resistant catalysts,11b,11d was less active compared to EuOBr. The stability of the latter material was also evident on cycling of the feed concentration of oxygen (Figure 2 b). Notably, the performance of EuOBr was only slightly affected by the oxygen concentration, showing no deactivation. Contrarily, the conversion of HBr over CeO2 drops to almost zero under the preferred stoichiometric feed (O2:HBr=0.25), and is only partially recovered upon returning to higher oxygen concentrations. The outstanding robustness of EuOBr was further demonstrated by its stable activity in a time-on-stream test under a stoichiometric feed at 523 K (Figure 2 c). Under the same conditions, the bromine production over CeO2 almost completely ceased just after 6 h. The deactivation profiles of this material observed upon temperature and oxygen cycling, as well as with time-on-stream coincide with the behavior of other highly active catalysts in this reaction, such as RuO2.11c,11d
The contrasting performance of EuOBr and CeO2 was rationalized by in-depth characterization of the catalysts recovered after different periods of time-on-stream in HBr oxidation. The appearance of new reflections in the X-ray diffraction patterns of the used samples indicated a chemical transformation of CeO2 (Figure 2 d); based on the increasing degree of bromination (see proceeding text), this was tentatively ascribed to the formation of (oxy)bromide phases (Supporting Information, Figure S6). Furthermore, pronounced particle sintering was revealed by a drop in surface area of the catalyst recovered after 6 h of reaction (13 m2 g−1) with respect to the fresh material (27 m2 g−1), which was also supported by electron microscopy examination (Supporting Information, Figure S7). Remarkably, the bulk structure of EuOBr showed no significant change after 20 h of use (Figure 2 d; Supporting Information, Figure S7), although its surface area (19 m2 g−1) was slightly decreased compared to the fresh catalyst (22 m2 g−1). The profound resistance of EuOBr to further bromination, and the progressive uptake of bromine by CeO2, are supported by the elemental maps obtained using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX; Figure 2 e; Supporting Information, Figure S7), and thermogravimetric analysis (Supporting Information, Figure S8). Inspection of the fresh and used CeO2 by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further demonstrated the increase of bromine content in the surface region of this catalyst upon use (Figure 2 f), leading to its reduction (Supporting Information, Figure S9), ultimately resulting in its deactivation (Figure 2 c). On the other hand, EuOBr displayed a constant Br:Eu ratio of about 0.7 in the surface region (Figure 2 f), indicating that the surface of the catalyst remains rich in oxygen under a stoichiometric feed. Europium was found to predominantly exist as Eu3+ with a minor contribution of Eu2+ (Supporting Information, Figure S10), suggesting the Eu3+/Eu2+ redox couple is responsible for the catalyst's activity. Based on these results, the exceptional stability of EuOBr can be ascribed to its structural integrity, which is preserved in oxygen- and HBr-rich feed mixtures.
Given the outstanding performance of EuOBr in HBr oxidation, the material was further evaluated in methane oxybromination (MOB), which is an alternative option that accomplishes continuous bromine looping by integrating HBr oxidation and methane functionalization in a single step (Figure 1; Supporting Information, Figure S1).13 Besides stability and activity constraints, a major challenge in the design of a MOB catalyst is to attain a high selectivity to CH3Br by suppressing the side combustion reactions.13 The latter are avoided if methane bromination and HBr oxidation are conducted separately, which favors the two-step route over MOB. Notably, the selectivity to CH3Br over EuOBr (85–65 % at 6–33 % single-pass methane conversion) substantially exceeded that of the benchmark (VO)2P2O7 (VPO) and CeO2 catalysts at comparable reaction rates in the broad range of conditions applied (Figure 3; Supporting Information, Figure S11).13 EuOBr also provided the highest selectivity to CH3Br (7–56 %) and CH2Br2 (2–30 %) on the basis of HBr (51–95 % single-pass conversion), although the selectivity to bromine (17–90 %) was significant (Supporting Information, Figure S12). Moreover, EuOBr exhibited a low formation of carbon oxides (COx), yielding bromine and dibromomethane (CH2Br2) as the dominant byproducts, which can be further upgraded via bromination and reproportionation, respectively (Figure 1; Supporting Information, Figure S1).2, 6, 9

To rationalize the activity of EuOBr in MOB, the catalyst was evaluated in methane combustion and methane bromination (Supporting Information, Figure S13), which were chosen as the test reactions to probe the catalyst's ability to dissociate C−H and form C−Br bonds, respectively. The low activity in methane combustion and absence of a catalytic effect in methane bromination, suggest a low propensity of this material to activate this alkane. Moreover, MOB over EuOBr proceeds in the same temperature window (T>733 K) as the non-catalytic gas-phase bromination of methane, whereby the two reactions exhibit almost identical apparent activation energies (Supporting Information, Figure S13). It is thus proposed that MOB proceeds by the gas-phase reaction of methane with molecular bromine that is (re)generated by HBr oxidation on EuOBr.13b,13c
Having identified the outstanding properties of EuOBr in HBr oxidation and MOB, the next step was to develop a ready-to-use technical catalyst based on this material. Besides reducing the price of a catalyst, the dispersion of an active phase over a suitable carrier can improve the intrinsic activity by ensuring both a high surface area and favorable electronic interaction. To study the potential impact of active phase dispersion, EuOBr was supported on three carriers: Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2 (9 wt % Eu) yielding catalysts denoted as EuOBr/Al2O3, EuOBr/ZrO2, and EuOBr/SiO2, respectively. These were evaluated in HBr oxidation revealing the following activity trend: EuOBr/Al2O3 > EuOBr/ZrO2 > EuOBr/SiO2 (Figure 4 a). Notably, the conversion of HBr over EuOBr/Al2O3 substantially exceeded that of the bulk system in the low-temperature region; that is, enabling an over one order of magnitude higher rate of HBr oxidation per content of europium, while preserving its resistance against bromination (Supporting Information, Figure S13). Characterization of the fresh and used samples revealed an atomic level dispersion of europium over all supported catalysts (Figure 5; Supporting Information, Figures S15 and S16). The specific surface area of the best performing EuOBr/Al2O3 was intermediate between that of EuOBr/ZrO2 and EuOBr/SiO2 (Supporting Information, Table S3), suggesting that the observed activity trend is also affected by the specific interaction with the support. On the other hand, the degree of bromination, ability to evolve bromine, and reducibility of the supported catalysts, (which all decrease in the order: EuOBr/Al2O3 > EuOBr/ZrO2 ≫ EuOBr/SiO2; Supporting Information, Figures S16, S17, and S18), strongly correlate with the activity in HBr oxidation. This confirms the impact of the carrier identity on the susceptibility to bromination, whereby the supported systems with a bromine content close to that of the oxybromide display a higher activity in HBr oxidation. The outstanding performance of EuOBr/Al2O3 was thus rationalized by the ability of Al2O3 to stabilize the brominated form of the catalyst and to promote the bromine evolution with respect to the bulk system.

In the case of MOB, the supported systems led to an increased production of COx with respect to bulk EuOBr (Figure 3; Supporting Information, Figure S19). This was particularly pronounced over EuOBr/Al2O3, which could be attributed to its high oxidizing potential (Supporting Information, Figure S18) as well as the propensity of Al2O3 to combust halocarbons.14 On the other hand, an enhanced COx formation over EuOBr/SiO2 is consistent with the low degree of catalyst bromination, which promotes combustion.13c EuOBr/ZrO2 shows balanced redox properties and a relatively high degree of bromination, providing the highest selectivity to CH3Br among the supported systems, which is close to that of the bulk EuOBr and is also preserved at lower europium loading (Supporting Information, Figure S20).
Based on the relative performance of the supported systems, Al2O3 and ZrO2 extrudates were chosen to prepare technical catalysts (EuOBr/Al2O3-t and EuOBr/ZrO2-t), which were tested in low-temperature HBr oxidation and MOB under stoichiometric, and substoichiometric feeds, respectively. The activities of EuOBr/Al2O3-t and EuOBr/ZrO2-t matched that of the supported systems in powder form and were stable for over 60 h of operation under the harsh conditions (Figure 4 b,c) with no detectable loss of europium.
In conclusion, EuOBr was found to be an exceptional catalyst for HBr oxidation, enabling low-temperature operation under a stoichiometric feed, and in conditions inaccessible to existing systems. This was ascribed to the marked bromine evolution activity and inherent resistance to further bromination of the oxybromide phase. Moreover, this material provided a high selectivity to CH3Br in MOB, outperforming all previously reported catalysts. The substantially suppressed COx production over EuOBr opens the door for the development of catalytic systems that do not produce COx side products. Thereby, the conversion of CH2Br2 via reproportionation could further enhance the overall selectivity to CH3Br. To bridge the gap between the activity of EuOBr in bromine recovery processes and its high price, the impact of different carriers on EuOBr performance was investigated. Al2O3 and ZrO2 were identified as the best supports for HBr oxidation and MOB, respectively, enabling an order of magnitude improved utilization of europium compared to the bulk catalyst. Catalysts in technical form prepared using Al2O3 and ZrO2 supports displayed robust performance, thus demonstrating a realistic potential for application in bromine-based processes that can enable the decentralized valorization of stranded natural gas.
