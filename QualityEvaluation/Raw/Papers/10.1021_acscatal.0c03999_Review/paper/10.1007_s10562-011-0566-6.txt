Abstract
Cr/silicalite-1 and Cr/H[B]MFI catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method, and Cr/H[B]MFI were further treated by steaming. The catalysts were employed for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2 as the oxidant. Cr/H[B]MFI showed significantly higher catalytic activity than Cr/silicalite-1, and steamed Cr/H[B]MFI was superior in the reaction stability to Cr/H[B]MFI. The nature of the supported chromium species have been characterized by a number of physicochemical techniques, such as Raman, UV–vis and NMR. It is concluded that the steaming led to the auto-reduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+, and resultant Cr3+ species might be located near the boron center in the borosilicate framework to counterbalance the negative charge of the framework. The transformation of Cr6+ species to Cr3+ species, facilitated by the steaming process and the presence of boron in the catalyst, is responsible for the enhanced stability of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide as the oxidant.
Graphical Abstract
Steaming treatment of Cr/H[B]MFI resulted in enhanced catalytic stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2 as oxidant, probably due to the transformation of some Cr6+ species to Cr3+ ones.

1 Introduction
The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene has received considerable attention as an alternative reaction route to meet the increasing demand for propylene, which is mainly produced by the steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [1]. Transition metals (vanadium, gallium, chromium, molybdenum, etc.) supported on various materials such as metal oxides, mesoporous materials and zeolites have been examined in search of more effective catalysts [2–5]. However, the use of O2 as the oxidant resulted in unavoidable over-oxidation, leading to inefficient use of the reactant. Among the less conventional but milder oxidants, the employment of CO2 in the ODH of propane is of particularly interest since the utilization of CO2 as a reactant presents a formidable challenge for the chemistry [6–8]. Takehira and his co-workers [9, 10] introduced a number of metals into the MCM-41 support and claimed that Cr-MCM-41 gave the highest production of propylene in the ODH of propane with CO2 as the oxidant.
The oxidative dehydrogenation function of Cr-loaded catalysts has been exhibited in the transformation of isobutane to isobutylene, which is used as a feedstock for methyl tert-butyl ether [11, 12]. It is widely accepted that the catalytic activities of those Cr-loaded catalysts are determined by the nature of chromium species on the support materials, and extensive investigations have been carried out to correlate the catalytic performance with the physicochemical properties of catalysts. Nevertheless, there have been ongoing debates about the catalytic roles of the Cr species, because the identification of Cr species has proven to be difficult. Most of the practical methods for preparing Cr-loaded catalysts lead to a variety of Cr species. Cr can be present as an isolated unit and bulk oxide with different agglomeration forms. Moreover, redox properties of the Cr catalysts are determined by the Cr valence states, coordination numbers, molecular structures, bulk oxide features, active phase density, etc., which are related with preparation methods, the nature of supports and the pretreatment conditions. The difficulties of characterizing Cr components are further aggravated taking into the account of the high mobility and reactivity with the solid support [13]. Therefore, characterization of Cr-supported catalysts requires a variety of characterization techniques, not only for the Cr species, but also for the support materials, to provide complementary information.
The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions. The chromium has been introduced to a number of molecular sieves by different methods and applied to a number of catalytic reactions [14–16]. It has been shown that acidic properties of the zeolite support strongly influence the formation of Cr species. However, there have been controversies about the catalytic roles of Cr species in the literature, and systematic studies are necessary to unravel the relevant reaction mechanisms. In addition, Cr3+ might be employed as a heteroatom incorporated into the frameworks of molecular sieve thus affecting the properties of resulting zeotype materials. Unfortunately, although great efforts have been devoted into the synthesis, there is hardly solid evidence for successful incorporation of Cr3+ into the framework of silicalite-1 materials, possibility owing to the high crystallization energies of octahedral coordination of Cr3+.
In the present study, we have prepared Cr supported catalysts over silicalite-1 (MFI topology) and borosilicate H[B]MFI, and tested their catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using CO2 as the oxidant. Borosilicate has been claimed to be an effective support to prepare vanadium-loaded catalysts for the ODH of propane [17]. We gave further steaming treatment of the catalyst with H[B]MFI as the support to take the advantage of the high reactivity of Cr species toward water molecule to obtain various Cr species. A variety of characterization techniques were applied to investigate the Cr species on different catalysts. The motivation is to understand the catalytic functions of different Cr species to develop more active and selective catalysts with good stability for the application in industry.
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation of Catalysts
The boron-containing MFI zeolite was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis in a autoclave. Cab-O-Sil M5 and H3BO3 were employed as silicon and boron sources, respectively. Tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) was used as the template. The sol–gel mixture was kept at 423 K for 7 days under tumbling conditions. The obtained crystals were filtered, washed and dried at 373 K overnight. The sodium type of MFI zeolites were ion-exchanged with NH4NO3, followed by calcination at 823 K for 10 h to produce the proton type H[B]MFI. ICP elemental analysis indicated that the Si/B ratio of the zeolite was 42 whereas the Si to B ratio was 5 in the sol–gel mixture, and the impurity of Al was below 0.1 wt%. For the synthesis of silicalite-1, no boron source was used. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement confirmed the typical MFI topology with high crystallinities for the samples (not shown).
Supported Cr catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of borosilicate H[B]MFI or silicalite-1 support with aqueous solutions of chromium nitrate nonhydrate (Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, Aldrich). Typically, the solid support was intimately mixed with the incipient volumes of aqueous solution containing a predetermined amount of chromium oxide precursor to prepare 3.0 wt% catalyst. The mixture was kept in a dessicator to remove the water, and then dried at 393 K overnight. Finally, the sample was calcined in simulated air atmosphere at 823 K for 6 h at the ramping rate of 1.5 K/min. The catalysts were designated as Cr/H[B]MFI and Cr/silicalite-1, respectively. Further steaming treatment of the Cr/H[B]MFI was carried out at 873 K in the presence of 46% water vapor for 1 h with the balance gas of 2% O2/N2. The catalyst was denoted by Cr/H[B]MFI-st.
2.2 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was measured using a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (RINT-Ultima III). XRD patterns were recorded in the range of 5° < 2θ < 50° using Cu Kα radiation at a scanning speed of 2° min−1.
Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (DR-UV–vis) studies of the prepared samples were performed on a JASCO V-650 spectrophotometer in the range of 800–200 nm with BaSO4 as the reference at room temperature. The spectra were converted to the Kubelka–Munk (KM) function.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu ESCA-3200 spectrometer with monochromatic Mg Kα exciting radiation. The catalyst powder was contained in a stainless-steel holder and installed in a vacuum chamber under a pressure below 1 × 10−9 mbar.
Raman spectra of the powered samples were recorded on a JASCO NRS-2100 laser Raman spectrometer. The measurements were carried out at room temperature, with the 514.5 nm line of an argon ion laser as the excitation source. The power of laser upon the powered sample was 100 mW. The samples were placed under a microscope, making it possible for the laser beam to be focused.
H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles of the catalysts were recorded on a Multitrack TPR equipment (Japan BEL). In the measurement, 100 mg catalyst was loaded into a quartz reactor and held in the middle by quartz wool. The sample was pretreated in vacuum at 323 K for 1 h to degas the sample. Subsequently, the sample was exposed to 5% H2/He (10 mL/min−1), and the reduction was carried out from 323 to 1,073 K at the heating rate of 5 K/min. A mass spectrometer was used to monitor consumed hydrogen.
Solid-state 11B and 29Si magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectra were obtained on a JEOL ECA-400 spectrometer. B(OH)3 was used as the reference sample for 11B NMR. 11B MAS NMR spectra were obtained with π/2 pulse width of 2 μs and pulse delay of 5 s. The employed boron resonance frequency was at 128.34 MHz and the sample spinning rate speed was 7.0 kHz. Tetramethylsilane was used as the reference sample for 29Si NMR. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were obtained with π/2 pulse width of 7 μs and pulse delay of 60 s.
Infrared spectra were recorded in a transmission mode on an FT/IR 7300 spectrometer with an MCT detector at a resolution of 4 cm−1 and 32 scans. The in situ cell, with NaCl windows, were cooled by liquid nitrogen through a stainless-steel tube, and the NO adsorption/desorption measurement was carried out at cryogenic temperatures. Typically, a self-supporting wafer (ca. 10 mg) was mounted on a holder, and the sample was treated in vacuum (0.1 Pa) at 823 K for 1 h to remove adsorbed water before cooling to 173 K. A background spectrum was measured at 173 K, and then the sample was exposed to 1,000 Pa of dosed NO gas. We observed a significant decrease in the NO pressure after exposing NO to the catalysts, indicating the adsorption of NO on the surface of catalysts. After the pressure was stabilized, the in situ cell was evacuated to 0.1 Pa and the infrared spectra were recorded. The cooling system was stopped, and the sample temperature increased gradually owing to the heat exchange with the environment. The desorption of NO at elevated temperature was recorded, and only the observed NO species at 193 K were shown in this report. The difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the background spectra. We note that there is almost no difference between the background spectra at 173 and 193 K.
2.3 Catalytic Tests
The catalytic reactions of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor with the reactor outlet pressure atmospheric. The reaction temperature, measured by a thermocouple inserted into the reactor, was set at 873 K. The effluent was analyzed by two well-calibrated online gas chromatographs (Shimadzu) with thermal conductive detectors (TCD). Thermon 3000 on Chromosorb was used to detect CO2 and the aliphatic products from C2 to C6. CO and CH4 were analyzed by a silica gel column. The catalyst (100 mg) was loaded into the reactor and treated under N2 atmosphere (50 mL/min) for 1 h at 873 K at the ramping rate of 5 K/min. The reactant mixture consisted of propane (15.15 kPa, 99.99%), CO2 (15.15 kPa, 99.99%) with N2 as the balance. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was kept at 1.1 g g−1 h−1, and overall WHSV was 7.3 g g−1 h−1. For the stability tests, a physical mixture of 0.1 g catalyst and a certain amount of quartz powder was employed to form the catalyst bed with length/diameter ratio of 5. The conversion of propane was calculated by the inlet and outlet concentrations of propane. The selectivity of the products was based on the overall carbon numbers present in the products. The carbon balance was ca. 95%, indicating the coke accumulation on the catalyst surface.
3 Results and Discussion
As shown in the XRD patterns of studied catalysts (Fig. 1), no other diffraction peaks but those of the supports were observed. Cr/H[B]MFI-st retained the MFI structure after the steaming treatment. Moreover, no crystallites of chromium oxide phase were visible by the XRD, indicating the well dispersion of Cr species. We observed no significant change after the catalysts were used for the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2.

The UV–vis measurement of the prepared samples was obtained under ambient conditions, and the spectra are displayed in Fig. 2. Although the spectra were complex and might encompass several overlapping bands, several bands were distinguishable at 268, 362, 463 and 608 nm. Usually, the UV bands at 268 and 362 nm are assigned to the charge transfer between O–Cr6+ bonds, and the bands at 463 and 608 nm are attributed to the presence of octahedral Cr3+ in Cr2O3 or CrOx. For the sample of Cr/silicalite-1 (Fig. 2a), both Cr6+ and Cr3+ species were observed despite the fact that the Cr precursor for the catalyst preparation was Cr3+. The presence of Cr6+ resulted from the oxidation of Cr3+ by the calcination in the preparation procedures. Compared with the silicalite-1 support, the use of H[B]MFI as the support resulted in the absence of band in the 463 and 608 nm (Fig. 2b), suggesting the efficiency of the transformation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ on H[B]MFI support. In other words, Cr was more readily converted to Cr6+ on H[B]MFI than on silicalite-1, and we suggest that the majority of Cr species on Cr/H[B]MFI were Cr6+. However, further streaming treatment over Cr/H[B]MFI led to the appearance of bands at 463 and 608 nm (Fig. 2c), indicating the generation of Cr3+ species although the steaming was performed in the presence of O2. Obviously, the water vapor played crucial roles in the auto-reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ during the steaming process.

In addition to the UV–vis spectroscopy, the oxidation states of Cr were also studied by XPS, although it has been shown to be of limited use on the catalysts of transition metal loaded on zeolites because only the metal species located near the external surface can be probed. The experimental spectra were fitted with two bands at 576 and 580 eV, which were assigned to Cr3+ and Cr6+, respectively. For the sake of simplicity, only the quantitative data after fitting are listed in Table 1. For the Cr species that can be detected by XPS, it is evident that the Cr3+ to Cr6+ ratio was significantly higher on Cr/H[B]MFI-st than on Cr/H[B]MFI; this underpinned the UV–vis observation that steaming treatment converted some Cr6+ oxide species into Cr3+ oxide species.

Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique to study the Cr species on the oxide support, and the ambient Raman spectra of the prepared catalysts are exhibited in Fig. 3 in the range of 1,400–400 cm−1. A weak and broad band at ca. 850 cm−1 was visible on Cr/silicalite-1 (Fig. 3a); this Raman shift might be related with the presence of hydrated surface chromium oxide species such as trichromate Cr3O10 2− [18]. Moreover, a strong and sharp peak at 550 cm−1 was clearly distinguished, which was assigned to the interaction between oxygen atoms and the octahedrally coordinated Cr3+; such a band was observed on the crystals of Cr2O3. When Cr was introduced into H[B]MFI, no band was observed (Fig. 3b), but further steaming treatment resulted in the appearance of the Raman shift at 550 cm−1 (Fig. 3c). This is in agreement with the UV–vis spectra which implied that the steaming treatment caused the auto-reduction of some Cr6+ species into Cr3+ species.

Figure 4 shows the profiles of temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of the Cr loaded samples with H2. When Cr was loaded on silicalite-1, no reduction of the Cr species was observed in the studied temperature range (Fig. 4a), although some of the Cr species seemed to be present in the oxidation state of Cr6+ as indicated by the UV–vis measurements. However, the introduction of Cr into the support of H[B]MFI led to a single reduction peak at ca. 750 K on Cr/H[B]MFI, suggesting a single reduction step of Cr species (Fig. 4b). This Tmax has been attributed to the reduction of Cr6+ or Cr5+ to Cr3+ species [9]. Clearly, the two supports of H[B]MFI and silicalite-1 caused different Cr6+-related species; i.e., the boron present in the borosilicate support facilitated the formation of some Cr6+ species that were readily reduced by H2 to Cr3+. Moreover, such readily-reduced Cr6+ species on Cr/H[B]MFI could be transformed into Cr3+ by steaming treatment, as suggested by the TPR of Cr/H[B]MFI-st in which no reduction from Cr6+ to Cr3+ was observed (Fig. 4c). Therefore, we propose that there might be two kinds of Cr6+ species on Cr/H[B]MFI; one Cr6+ species was similar to the Cr6+ species over Cr/silicalite-1 that was difficult to be reduced, and the other was the Cr6+ species related with the presence of boron, and was readily reduced to Cr3+ with H2 reduction or by steaming treatment.

The coordination geometry of boron incorporation in the borosilicate frameworks has been studied extensively, and it is well established that there are two kinds of boron centers, tetrahedral B[4] and trigonal B[3], upon hydration/dehydration treatments [19, 20]. The coordination state of boron in the synthesized samples was studied by 11B MAS NMR, and Fig. 5 depicts the spectra collected from the boron-containing samples. When Cr was loaded on H[B]MFI (Fig. 5a), a sharp and narrow peak was observed at −3 ppm; this resonance represented the tetrahedrally coordinated boron in the zeolite frameworks. Moreover, the spectrum showed a broad band (−9 to −2 ppm) that originated from the second order quadrupole broadening of trigonally coordinated 11B nuclei in a planar configuration, indicating the presence of B(OSi)3 in the Cr/H[B]MFI. However, after the sample was treated in steam (Fig. 5b), the broad band due to the trigonally coordinated boron disappeared, while the characteristic peak of B[4], B(SiO)4, still remained. Moreover, no broad line at ca. 17–10 ppm, the characteristic resonance of nonframework trigonal boron species, was visible on either of the samples, suggesting that the majority of boron species were located in the borosilicate framework even after steaming treatment. Hence, we propose that the steaming treatment converted the trigonal boron to the tetrahedral one in the zeolite framework, leading to the disappearance of the broad band due to trigonal boron center. Such transformation was facilitated by the presence of water vapor in the steaming [19], and chromium-containing cations such as [CrO]+ might stabilize boron in the tetrahedral coordination.

The 29Si NMR spectra of the prepared samples are presented in Fig. 6. The spectrum of Cr/silicalite-1 revealed that the majority of the silicon is in the tetrahedrally coordinated state (−112 ppm) of Si–(OSi)4 (Q4) in the zeolite framework. For the boron-containing samples, broad bands centered at −111 ppm were dominant. Nevertheless, no substantial band at −102 ppm representing HO–Si–(OSi)3 (Q3) was observed after the sample was steamed (Fig. 6c), implicating that no remarkable amount of B–OSi bonds underwent hydrolysis to form silanol. The successive hydrolysis is a prerequisite for the dislodgment of boron from the framework and the formation of the silanol nest; thus it is concluded that such “nests” were not significantly formed over Cr/H[B]MFI-st. Together with the octahedral coordination nature of Cr3+, the possibility of incorporation of Cr3+ into the zeolite framework during the steaming process can be excluded. Hence, the Cr3+ oxide species after steaming is suggested to be located in the ion-exchange sites to counterbalance the negative charge of the framework.

The NO molecule has been widely used as a probe to identify the oxidation state of the Cr species on a variety of supports. However, the interpretation of the adsorbed NO species are controversial in the literature due to the complexity of the adsorbed NO species and the heterogeneity of the surface Cr species [21, 22]. Figure 7 shows the difference IR spectra for NO adsorbed on the prepared catalysts at 193 K. We note that no adsorption of NO was observed on the parent materials of silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI borosilicate, and thus all the bands in Fig. 7 were caused by the Cr species. A peak at 1,840 cm−1 was eminent on Cr/silicalite-1 with a visible shoulder at 1,860 cm−1 (Fig. 7a). This overlapping band was related with the dinitrosyl species adsorbed on the chromium species. For Cr/H[B]MFI, the N–O stretching vibration of Crn+(NO)2 dinitrosyl shifted to 1,862 cm−1 and its asymmetric stretching mode was clearly visible at 1,741 cm−1 (Fig. 7b). In addition, a broad band at 1,930 cm−1 was observed which was a typical stretching mode of mononitrosyl species, indicating the presence of NO+ on the surface [23]. Nevertheless, the chromium species corresponding to NO+ remained unclear. After steaming, the most significant change was that the band at 1,930 cm−1 disappeared, implicating that the nature of related Cr species changed (Fig. 7c). In short, the IR of adsorbed NO confirmed that there was a difference in the supported Cr species between Cr/H[B]MFI and Cr/silicalite-1 catalysts, and that steaming treatment of Cr/H[B]MFI led to the transformation of certain Cr species.

The dehydrogenation of propane with the oxidant of CO2 at 873 K are shown in Fig. 8 as a function of time on stream (TOS) for Cr/silicalite-1 and Cr/H[B]MFI catalysts. The initial propane conversion over Cr/H[B]MFI was more than 50%, but decreased quickly to ca. 20% in 2 h whereas the conversion of propane remained lower than 10% over Cr/silicalite-1 under the given reaction conditions. The representative selectivities of the reactions are listed in Table 2. The propylene was the main hydrocarbon product detected in the reactor effluent (higher than 90%) over both catalysts, indicating the efficiency of Cr species in the catalytic function. No higher boiling-point hydrocarbon product was observed. However, the main by-product over Cr/silicalite-1 was ethane, whereas a significant formation of ethene (ca. 5%) was observed upon Cr/H[B]MFI.

Because fixed bed reactors are usually employed for this process in the industrial application, the stability of reaction is of great importance for the practical use of the catalysts. The advantage of steam-treated catalyst over Cr/H[B]MFI catalyst is shown in Fig. 9 for the stability tests for 60 h. The steam-treated catalyst, Cr/H[B]MFI-st, exhibited relatively stable catalytic activity although its initial activity was lower than its counterpart of Cr/H[B]MFI. In the prolonged reaction time of more than 40 h, the conversion of propane was higher over Cr/H[B]MFI-st than Cr/H[B]MFI. Moreover, both the reaction selectivities toward the desired product of propylene remained nearly unchanged (ca. 90%) as listed in Table 2. It is well known that the coke formation and reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ are responsible for the deactivation of dehydrogenation catalysis [24]. This is in agreement with our results that the activities could be partly restored by the burning of the coke, indicating a part of the deactivation was caused by the coke formation (not shown). Moreover, steaming is an efficient method for reducing Brönsted acidity in the zeolites, and the resulting decrease in acidic sites might contribute to the enhanced reaction stabilities.

In summary, the catalytic behavior is determined by the nature of Cr species loaded on the support. Our characterization results unambiguously confirmed that there were significant differences in the nature of the Cr species among the catalysts, affecting their catalytic functions in the studied reaction. Various Cr species have different functions to catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Cr6+ monochromate was suggested to be more active than Cr3+ polychromate in the ODH of propane to propylene with CO2 as the oxidant [9]. This is in accordance with our finding that the initial activity of Cr/H[B]MFI was higher than that of Cr/H[B]MFI-st. Nevertheless, Cr3+ monochromate such as [CrO]+, generated after the steaming treatment on Cr/H[B]MFI, might also catalyze the studied reaction, particularly from the stability point of view as shown in Fig. 9. Indeed, the catalytic roles of different Cr3+ species in the ODH of propane were elaborated [11, 25, 26], and it was claimed that the reduced Cr3+ formed from Cr6+ during the reaction was less active than the dispersed Cr3+ oxide [11]. In other words, different Cr3+ species could play different catalytic functions.
4 Conclusions
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was investigated over a series of chromium-based catalysts supported on MFI zeolitic materials. Structural characterization suggests that the boron present in the framework modified the nature of introduced Cr species. According to UV–vis, Raman and H2-TPR, the steaming process resulted in auto-reduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+ on Cr/H[B]MFI. A significantly enhanced stability was achieved over the steaming-treated catalyst, which was possibly attributed to the related Cr3+ oxide species.
