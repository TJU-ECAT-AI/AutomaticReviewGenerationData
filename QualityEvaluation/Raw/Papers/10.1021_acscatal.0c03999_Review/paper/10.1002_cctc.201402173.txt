Isobutane Dehydrogenation over Metal (Fe, Co, and Ni) Oxide and Sulfide Catalysts: Reactivity and Reaction Mechanism
Graphical Abstract
Benefits of sulfur: The introduction of sulfur into metal oxide catalysts dilutes and separates the aggregated metallic species. As a result, hydrogen atoms in isobutane molecules bond with sulfur atoms neighboring metallic species on the catalyst surface and thus the carbon–hydrogen bonds weaken and break. Subsequently, isobutene and hydrogen are released to the gas phase as final products.
Abstract
Silica-supported metal oxide and sulfide catalysts of Fe, Co, and Ni were evaluated comparatively for the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane. The results of the activity test and temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen characterization indicate that metal oxides, except Fe2O3, are easily reduced to metal ensembles, which are extremely active for alkane hydrogenolysis and lead to the formation of a considerable amount of methane and coke. However, the dehydrogenation performance was significantly improved after sulfidation treatment. The introduction of sulfur affects the catalysts in two ways: one is the geometric effect, which dilutes the aggregated metallic species and reduces hydrogenolysis activity, and the other is the electronic effect, which facilitates the desorption of olefin and increases the product selectivity. Moreover, the reaction mechanism is explored by using the proposed model of the interaction between isobutane and sulfide catalysts. Finally, sulfur loss and partial coke deposition are determined to be the main reasons for catalyst deactivation.
Introduction
The dehydrogenation of light alkanes has attracted increased attention as an efficient route to produce alkenes from low-cost saturated hydrocarbons.1, 2 A number of commercial catalytic dehydrogenation processes have been developed for the production of propene and isobutene, which are widely used in the synthesis of polymers and gasoline-octane boosting additives.
Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are generally used in these commercial dehydrogenation processes. To increase alkene selectivity and decrease coke formation, appropriate promoters, such as Sn, K, Ca, and Li,3–6 are introduced into these catalysts. Although the catalytic performance is relatively satisfactory after the modification, the high cost of Pt and the hazardous effects of Cr6+ have unavoidably limited the use of these catalysts.
The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, an alternative route to catalytic dehydrogenation, has been studied widely owing to its thermodynamic advantages.7, 8 Previous studies have been focused on supported vanadium oxide9–12 and molybdenum oxide13–16 catalysts. Although many attempts have been made to modify the catalyst formula,17, 18 and to select mild oxidants,19–21 oxidation reactions inevitably occur, leading to increased formation of COx and inferior selectivity toward alkenes.22, 23 Consequently, it is difficult to make a significant breakthrough in this route. Therefore, the development of a cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalyst system demonstrating an excellent dehydrogenation performance in the absence of oxidants is important.24
Because CH bond activation is regarded as the rate-determining step in alkane dehydrogenation,25, 26 the mechanism of CH bond activation of the alkane and the interaction of the catalyst should be determined primarily. However, owing to the complexity of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, the activation of alkanes with transition-metal ions in the gas phase has been investigated.27–37 It has been found that CC bond insertion is more favorable on thermochemical grounds than CH bond insertion over Ni, Co, and Fe ions.31, 37
We have previously found that the introduction of sulfur into oxide catalysts of Ni and Fe inhibits cracking reactions effectively and increases dehydrogenation activity significantly.38, 39 In addition to the aforementioned catalysts, a series of metal sulfide catalysts demonstrating an excellent dehydrogenation performance, even better than that of industrial Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, has been discovered.40 Given that supported MoS2,41 CoS,42 and NiS43 catalysts are widely used in the hydrogenation reaction, and that hydrogenation and dehydrogenation are reverse reactions, the excellent dehydrogenation performance of these sulfides seems to be reasonable. However, supported sulfides of Cu, Mn, and Fe, rarely used in hydrogenation reactions, also demonstrate excellent performance. Therefore, to better understand the active sites for dehydrogenation, the reaction behavior and mechanisms of sulfide catalysts should be investigated in detail.
Herein, to explore the reasons for the remarkable improvement in the dehydrogenation performance after the introduction of sulfur, silica-supported oxide catalysts of Fe, Co, and Ni with and without sulfidation were chosen as representative samples and evaluated for the dehydrogenation of isobutane. Moreover, the dehydrogenation reaction mechanisms and the origin of catalyst deactivation over metal sulfides were systematically studied.
Results and Discussion
Structural characteristics of metal oxide and sulfide catalysts
The XRD patterns of silica-supported oxide catalysts of Fe, Co, and Ni (with a loading of 13 wt %), along with those of the corresponding sulfide catalysts, are shown in Figure 1. The diffraction peaks representative of Fe2O3, Co3O4, and NiO are observed for oxide catalysts after calcination. As for the sulfide catalysts, newly emerged diffraction peaks characteristic of the cubic structure of FeS, CoS, and NiS have been detected, indicating that sulfidation treatment can efficiently convert oxides on the catalysts to the relevant sulfides.

In addition, BET surface areas and pore-structure properties of both metal oxide and sulfide catalysts were measured to clarify whether sulfidation treatment could have destructive effects on the pore channels of the catalysts; the results are listed in Table 1. These results indicate that the catalyst surface area and pore volume decreased slightly after sulfidation and the pore diameter increased to some extent, suggesting that sulfidation treatment caused no significant damage to the catalyst structure.

Performance of metal oxide catalysts
To detect the variation trend of products more accurately during the reaction, isobutane dehydrogenation was performed over silica-supported metal oxide catalysts with a pulse-mode microreactor equipped with an online mass spectrometer; the obtained mass spectra are shown in Figure 2. As for the 13 Fe2O3/SiO2 catalyst, an increasing trend of the signal intensity was detected for isobutane (m/z=58), isobutene (m/z=56), and hydrogen (m/z=2) in several initial pulses. The signal intensity demonstrated no significant change with the increase in pulse number. Moreover, the results of the activity test in the first 10 min are summarized in Table 1. Although the ability to activate isobutane was relatively poor for the Fe-based catalyst, the selectivity toward isobutene was the highest among the three catalysts.

Mass spectra of the pulse-mode isobutane dehydrogenation over silica-supported metal oxide catalysts.
Compared with the relatively stable signal intensity observed for the 13 Fe2O3/SiO2 catalyst, the signal intensity for 13 Co3O4/SiO2 and 13 NiO/SiO2 varied significantly with pulse number. The signal intensities of hydrogen and methane (m/z=16) first increased and then decreased. In contrast, the signals corresponding to isobutane and isobutene presented an opposite variation trend; that is, the minimum signal intensities of isobutane and isobutene were achieved when the signals corresponding to hydrogen and methane reached the maximum, implying that with the increase in pulse number, the reaction first transformed from dehydrogenation into cracking and then reverted to dehydrogenation.
For the 13 Co3O4/SiO2 and 13 NiO/SiO2 catalysts, the signal intensities of both hydrogen and methane began to increase at the same pulse number. However, as for the 13 NiO/SiO2 catalyst, the signal intensities of hydrogen and methane first increased at a faster rate and then decreased at a slower rate. Moreover, consistent with the activity results summarized in Table 1, no isobutene was detected in the mass spectra of the Ni-based catalyst, indicating that the cracking ability of NiO/SiO2 was much higher than that of Co3O4/SiO2. In addition, the coke content in the first 10 min was the highest over the 13 NiO/SiO2 catalyst.
To better understand the differences in the dehydrogenation performance of the 13 Fe2O3/SiO2, 13 Co3O4/SiO2, and 13 NiO/SiO2 catalysts, temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR) experiments were performed. As shown in Figure 3, the reducibility of the three catalysts decreased in the following order: 13 Co3O4/SiO2>13 NiO/SiO2>13 Fe2O3/SiO2, which indicated that the reduction of Fe2O3 species was the most difficult. The reduction temperatures of 13 Co3O4/SiO2 and 13 NiO/SiO2 were approximately 360 and 400 °C, respectively, which suggested that Co3O4 and NiO on the support could easily be reduced below the reaction temperature of 560 °C (see the dotted line in Figure 3). However, Fe2O3 species could not be reduced completely to the metallic state at that temperature. Therefore, the steady performance of the 13 Fe2O3/SiO2 catalyst can be attributed to its relatively stable redox properties, that is, it is difficult to reduce to a metallic species at the reaction temperature. In addition, the cracking ability of the three metal-based catalysts decreased in the following order: Ni>Co>Fe.

According to the above results, the transformation of the reaction with time on stream over Co3O4/SiO2 and NiO/SiO2 catalysts may be attributed to the changes in surface species. During the catalysis of metal oxide on the fresh catalyst, isobutene was generated initially through the dehydrogenation reaction in spite of the low activity. Subsequently, with the reduction of oxides in isobutane atmosphere, aggregated metal ensembles were formed in situ and played a significant role in cracking reactions, confirmed earlier in the dehydrogenation of isobutane over the NiO/MgAl2O4 catalyst.38 However, the active centers for cracking were gradually covered by the large amount of coke generated, which results in weakened cracking reactions; this observation was consistent with the reported result44 that the carbonaceous species formed on the Ni particles led to a low cracking activity of the Ni/MoO3 catalyst.
Formation of methane over metal oxide catalysts
Given the considerable amount of methane generated during isobutane dehydrogenation over Fe-, Co-, and Ni-based catalysts, the route for the formation of methane should be determined. Notably, metallic Ni facilitated CC bond scission in alkanes,31, 37, 45 and Coughlin et al.46, 47 reported that large ensembles of group VIII metals were active for the hydrogenolysis reaction. Moreover, Resasco et al.48 believed that aggregated metallic Ni catalyzed the hydrogenolysis reaction of isobutane and produced large amounts of methane and coke; this finding was consistent with our results. Considering that hydrogen has been introduced into the reactor in the work of Resasco et al.,48 the question to be answered is whether methane is formed through the hydrogenolysis reaction without the introduction of hydrogen.
To answer the above question, the pulse-mode isobutane dehydrogenation over silica-supported metallic Ni catalysts with and without exterior hydrogen was performed with a homemade apparatus (Scheme 1); the method is described in the Experimental Section. In the absence of exterior hydrogen (Figure 4 a), with the increase in pulse number, the signal intensity of methane (m/z=16) demonstrated an increasing trend owing to the increase in the signal intensity of hydrogen (m/z=2). In addition, the signals corresponding to isobutane (m/z=58) and isobutene (m/z=56) were detected, even though their intensities were too weak to be observed in the original proportion. In contrast, in the presence of exterior hydrogen (Figure 4 b), the intensities of hydrogen and methane reached the maximum and remained unchanged with the increase in pulse number. At the same time, the signals for isobutane and isobutene could not be detected in the pulse-mode spectra, which indicated that isobutane was completely converted to methane through the hydrogenolysis reaction in the presence of exterior hydrogen.

In conclusion, the large amount of methane generated during the catalysis of Fe-, Co-, and Ni-based catalysts resulted from the hydrogenolysis reaction of isobutane. The hydrogenolysis reaction occurs even without the introduction of hydrogen.
Performance of metal sulfide catalysts
The catalytic performance of Fe-, Co-, and Ni-based sulfide catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation was also evaluated under the same reaction conditions, and the results are presented in Table 1 and Figure 5. Herein, turnover frequency (TOF) is defined as the moles of isobutene produced per mole of active metal atoms per hour, and the number of active metal atoms was determined through H2 pulse chemisorption. The TOF values of metal sulfide catalysts were approximately ten times larger than those of the corresponding oxide catalysts (Table 1), suggesting that the dehydrogenation performance was improved remarkably after sulfidation treatment.

Catalytic performance of silica-supported metal sulfide catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation.
As listed in Table 1, the selectivity toward isobutene increased after sulfidation treatment, which was more than 85 wt % for all metal sulfide catalysts. Moreover, the catalytic activity was maintained at a relatively high level. Isobutane conversion reached up to 71 wt % for the 13 CoS/SiO2 catalyst and decreased in the following order: 13 CoS/SiO2>13 FeS/SiO2>13 NiS/SiO2. In addition, the coke content decreased significantly after sulfidation, especially for the Ni-based catalyst (Table 1). However, the excellent dehydrogenation performance was not maintained and both the conversion of isobutane and the selectivity toward isobutene decreased as the reaction proceeded (Figure 5). Such a phenomenon reveals possible loss and consumption of the active metal sulfide during the reaction.
To characterize the catalyst deactivation rate, a deactivation index, defined as the ratio of isobutane conversion at different reaction times to the initial isobutane conversion, is used; that is, a lower value represents much faster deactivation. The deactivation index decreased in the following order: 13 CoS/SiO2>13 FeS/SiO2>13 NiS/SiO2 (Figure 6), which is consistent with the order of isobutane conversion. These results suggested that the catalyst with higher activity deactivated much faster and was probably caused by the accelerated consumption of the active metal sulfide and increased coke deposition on the catalyst. In brief, an excellent dehydrogenation performance could be achieved at the initial reaction time for the three sulfide catalysts, although minor differences existed.

Effect of the loading amount of metal sulfide catalysts
To investigate the effect of the active-component loading on the dehydrogenation performance of metal sulfide catalysts, sulfided NiO/SiO2 catalysts with different NiO loadings (0.5, 1, 5, 9, 17, and 21 wt %) were prepared and evaluated. As shown in Figure 7, isobutane conversion increased gradually with the increase in the loading amount and reached the maximum of 74.8 wt % at a NiO loading of 17 wt %. With further increase in the loading amount, a minor decrease in isobutane conversion was observed. Notably, isobutane conversion up to 54.3 wt % could still be obtained with an NiO loading as low as 0.5 wt %. However, the low amount of active species on the catalyst surface was consumed quickly; thus, the activity decreased sharply with time on stream and only 19.5 % of the initial activity was reserved after 1 h reaction. In contrast, at higher loadings, both the conversion of isobutane and the selectivity toward isobutene decreased at a much slower rate with time on stream. This decrease was probably caused by faster replenishment of the consumed surface active sites by bulk NiS species.

Catalytic performance of sulfided NiO/SiO2 catalysts with different NiO loadings for isobutane dehydrogenation.
Ni dispersion and TOF values (defined as above) of sulfided NiO/SiO2 catalysts with different NiO loadings are listed in Table 2. With the decrease in NiO loading, both surface Ni density and particle size decreased gradually and Ni dispersion increased at the same time. During this process, the formation rate of isobutene decreased slightly at first and then increased gradually and accelerated at a low loading amount. On decreasing the NiO loading to 0.5 wt % the TOF value increased to 12.38. Thus, both the activity of a single Ni atom and the utilization efficiency of Ni species on the catalyst increased with the decrease in NiO loading.

As discussed above, a relatively high conversion ability of isobutane can still be obtained over supported NiS catalysts even with a low Ni loading. However, the deficiency of the active phase in bulk leads to a sharply decreasing catalytic activity.
Origin of catalyst deactivation
As discussed above, although an excellent dehydrogenation performance can be obtained for metal sulfide catalysts, the catalyst stability still needs to be improved. Therefore, to explore appropriate measures to recover the catalytic activity, the origin of the rapid catalyst deactivation should be investigated.
Phase analysis was performed for the three sulfide catalysts after a 5 h reaction time, and their XRD patterns are shown in Figure 1 c. For the spent 13 FeS/SiO2 catalyst, the intensity of diffraction peaks characteristic of FeS decreased as compared with those for the fresh sulfide catalyst. For the other two spent sulfide catalysts, Co9S8 and Ni3S2 emerged instead of the original CoS and NiS, respectively, which suggested the loss of sulfur during the reaction. Although the pathways of sulfur loss were different for the three sulfide catalysts, the loss of sulfur probably caused the deactivation of the catalyst.
An online mass spectrometer was also used to detect the released gases during isobutane dehydrogenation over the 13 NiS/SiO2 catalyst. In addition to the dehydrogenation product, a signal corresponding to H2S (m/z=34) was detected (data not shown). This observation confirms the loss of sulfur during the reaction as well as suggesting that it was lost mainly in the form of H2S, which is consistent with our previous report of isobutane dehydrogenation over Ni/MgAl2O4 catalysts.38
To supplement sulfur and recover the activity of the spent sulfide catalysts, a sulfidation treatment was performed for another 3 h after the 5 h reaction, and a total of five sulfidation–reaction cycles were performed. The initial conversion of isobutane and selectivity toward isobutene obtained in different cycles over the three sulfide catalysts are shown in Figure 8. Notably, the catalytic performance could be completely recovered after each sulfidation, demonstrating that sulfidation treatment is an appropriate approach to maintain the activity of metal sulfide catalysts. Moreover, isobutane dehydrogenation over metal sulfide catalysts, along with a co-feed of H2S (2 mL min−1), was performed. As shown in Figure 9, isobutane conversion decreased to some extent in the initial reaction period and then the catalytic performance remained relatively steady, with an isobutene yield greater than 50 wt % for all three samples in the continuous 7 h reaction. This finding indicated that high catalytic performance for dehydrogenation can be maintained with online replenishment of sulfur, which again demonstrated the importance of sulfur.

In addition to sulfur loss, coke deposition inevitably occurred and possibly contributed to catalyst deactivation. The temperature-programmed oxidation by oxygen (O2-TPO) test of the spent NiS/SiO2 catalyst was performed to investigate the coke deposited during the reaction; meanwhile, an online mass spectrometer was used to detect the released CO2 (m/z=44), and the result is presented in Figure 10 a. The appearance of two distinct peaks (327 and 464 °C) corresponding to CO2 formation during the coke-burning process indicated that at least two types of coke species existed on the catalyst.
Figure 10

PowerPoint
Mass spectra obtained during O2-TPO and H2-TPR of different NiS/SiO2 catalysts.
Full recovery of the activity of the catalyst through sulfidation not only indicated that sulfur loss was one reason for the catalyst deactivation, but also meant that coke deposition could probably be eliminated through sulfidation with H2S/H2. To investigate the above speculation, the H2-TPR test of the spent NiS/SiO2 catalyst was performed, and the corresponding MS spectra are shown in Figure 10 b. The appearance of methane (m/z=16) during the H2-TPR process suggested that the presence of hydrogen eliminated the coke deposition to some extent. After the H2-TPR test, the O2-TPO test of the spent catalyst was performed, and the corresponding mass spectra are shown in Figure 10 c. Compared with the spent catalyst without the H2-TPR process (Figure 10 a), the high-temperature peak in the mass spectra was generally retained; however, the low-temperature peak disappeared. These results revealed that the deposition of coke species burnt at low temperature (below 400 °C) was probably the other cause of catalyst deactivation whereas coke species burnt at high temperature had little effect on the catalytic activity.
Reaction mechanisms
Compared with the corresponding oxide catalysts, the remarkable improvement in the dehydrogenation performance of metal sulfide catalysts is surely not only caused by the modification of physicochemical properties (adsorption–desorption and redox behaviors, etc.), but can also be fundamentally attributed to the emergence of metal sulfides, which have been speculated to be the active sites of sulfide catalysts for dehydrogenation.38
According to the literature, the hydrogenolysis reaction of alkanes is structure sensitive49–51 and requires a large amount of aggregated metal sites to constitute the active phase.48 It is also believed that the hydrogenolysis activity is closely related to the size of metal particles.52–56 Dalmon and Martin54 reported that at least nineteen neighboring Ni atoms on the catalyst surface are necessary for the hydrogenolysis of butanes. Over Fe-, Co-, and Ni-based catalysts, the aggregated metallic sites formed in situ led to the generation of a large amount of methane owing to the hydrogenolysis reaction. Moreover, with the decrease in loading amount, the size of metal particles decreased and thus the activity of the hydrogenolysis reaction also decreased.38 Nevertheless, the dehydrogenation reaction seems to be structure insensitive, which is reflected by the high initial isobutane conversion over the sulfided Ni-based catalyst with NiO loading as low as 0.5 wt %. Moreover, Biloen et al.57 reported that the dehydrogenation reaction can be catalyzed even by a single metal-atom site.
The activity results indicated that the introduction of sulfur species played a significant role in the dehydrogenation reaction, and thus it is important to clarify how the sulfur species works. We have reported previously that the introduction of sulfur facilitated the dispersion of Ni particles on the MgAl2O4 support.38 Moreover, the existence of the metal–sulfur bond in metal sulfide catalysts weakened the interaction between metal atoms. Therefore, the effect of sulfur introduction can be explained in terms of the geometric effect, which dilutes the aggregated Ni sites on the catalyst surface and breaks large metallic Ni ensembles active for hydrogenolysis. Consequently, the occurrence of hydrogenolysis and coking reactions is reduced. Such an effect is similar to that of Sn introduction into Pt-based catalysts; Sn acts as a spacer, isolates Pt particles into smaller ensembles, reduces the deactivation rate, and increases the selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions.58, 59
In contrast, the bonding strength between the adsorbed intermediate and the catalyst surface also affected the reactivity significantly. The weak bonding interaction facilitated the desorption of the intermediate and reduced the reactivity whereas the strong bonding interaction led to the strengthened carbon–metal bond and weakened carbon–carbon bond in alkanes,60 finally resulting in an aggravated hydrogenolysis reaction and formation of methane. The adsorption amounts of isobutane and isobutene over reduced oxide catalysts (i.e., metal catalysts) and sulfided catalysts are listed in Table 3. As for metal catalysts, the adsorption amounts of both isobutane and isobutene decreased in the following order: Ni>Co>Fe, which was consistent with the order of cracking ability. Therefore, this result explained the high ability of the Ni-based catalyst for activating isobutane and the corresponding high isobutane conversion. Meanwhile, given the low adsorption amount of isobutene over the Fe-based catalyst, the formed isobutene could desorb from the catalyst promptly and the high selectivity toward isobutene could also be understood. Compared with metal catalysts, the adsorption amount of isobutane over sulfide catalysts was moderate for all three cases. However, the adsorption amount of isobutene decreased significantly after sulfidation treatment, especially for Ni- and Co-based catalysts. Such a phenomenon indicated that the introduction of sulfur facilitated the desorption of olefin; that is, the interaction between surface metal atoms and adsorbed alkene molecules was weakened by the presence of neighboring sulfur atoms. One possible reason is that a higher electron density of surface atoms, caused by the electron donation of introduced sulfur, led to more repulsive interactions with olefins. That is, the introduction of sulfur probably adjusted the electronic properties of Ni atoms, altered the nature of surface species, and decreased the adsorption heat of olefin as well as the activation energy of its desorption, consequently leading to an increased selectivity toward isobutene.

The interaction model between the isobutane molecule and the catalyst surface before and after sulfidation is demonstrated in Scheme 2. As for metal oxide catalysts, the oxides on the support are readily reduced to metal atoms during the reaction. A strong interaction between carbon atoms in isobutane molecules and the metal atoms weakens and breaks carbon–carbon bonds in isobutane and thus leads to the generation of a significant amount of methane. However, with the introduction of sulfur, the aggregated metallic species are diluted and separated, further reducing the possibility for the formation of the adjacent carbon–metal bonds in an isobutane molecule. In addition, the hydrogen atoms in isobutane molecules bond with sulfur atoms neighboring metallic species on the catalyst surface and thus the carbon–hydrogen bonds weaken and break. Subsequently, isobutene and hydrogen are released to the gas phase as the final products.

Interaction model between the isobutane molecule and the catalyst surface.
To better understand the active sites, the reaction mechanism of isobutane dehydrogenation over metal sulfide catalysts has been explored further. For example, in the NiS/SiO2 catalyst, NiS has a hexagonal structure (JCPDS no. 01-075-0613) as indicated by the XRD patterns. Moreover, for the hydrogenation reaction catalyzed by metal sulfide catalysts, the active sites are generally believed to be sulfur vacancies, that is, the coordinatively unsaturated sites.61–63 Therefore, the active Ni atom is speculated to be bonded with three sulfur atoms. Accordingly, a catalytic cycle of sulfide catalysts, including reaction, deactivation, and regeneration, is proposed, which is illustrated in Scheme 3. An isobutane molecule diffuses to the catalyst surface and dissociatively adsorbs on the coordinatively unsaturated Ni sites, forming an intermediate species (1, Figure 11) with a Ni atom bonded to the tertiary butyl group and a sulfur atom bonded to the left hydrogen atom. Through β-hydrogen transfer, a hydrogen molecule is formed and desorbs to the gas phase, leaving a labile intermediate (2, Figure 11) bonded to a π-bonded alkene. Then, an isobutene molecule is evolved and released from the catalyst surface; meanwhile, the active center is regenerated. If the NiS bond weakens, H2S is generated and released, and the Ni center with one less bonded sulfur atom (3, Figure 11) demonstrates much lower dehydrogenation activity (Scheme 3, red arrows). The catalytic activity of the spent catalyst can be recovered by sulfur replenishment through sulfidation with H2S/H2 (Scheme 3, blue arrows).

Conclusions
Silica-supported metal oxide and sulfide catalysts of Fe, Co, and Ni have been evaluated comparatively for the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane. The combined results of the activity test and catalyst characterization indicate that metal oxides, except Fe2O3 on silica, are easily reduced to metal ensembles active for alkane hydrogenolysis, which results in the formation of a large amount of methane and coke.
Metal sulfide catalysts have been prepared by sulfonation of the corresponding oxide catalysts with H2S/H2. After the introduction of sulfur, the hydrogenolysis reaction was inhibited effectively and the dehydrogenation performance was improved significantly. The selectivity toward isobutene of all the tested catalyst samples could reach up to 85 wt %, and isobutane conversion over the Co-based catalyst increased to 71 wt %. In general, the promoting effects of sulfur introduction can be understood in two ways: Firstly, the geometric effect dilutes the aggregated metallic species and inhibits the CC bond rupture; secondly the electronic effect facilitates the desorption of olefins and increases the product selectivity.
Furthermore, the mechanisms of dehydrogenation reaction, catalyst deactivation, and regeneration have been explored by using the speculated model of the interaction between isobutane molecules and sulfide catalysts. Finally, sulfur loss in the form of H2S and the deposition of coke species burnt at low temperature were determined to be the main reasons for catalyst deactivation.
Experimental Section
Catalyst preparation
Silica-supported oxide catalysts of Fe, Co, and Ni were prepared through an incipient wetness impregnation of mesoporous silica (80–180 μm) with aqueous solutions of Fe(NO3)3⋅9 H2O, Co(NO3)2⋅6 H2O, and Ni(NO3)2⋅6 H2O, respectively. The prepared catalysts were dried in air at 120 °C overnight and then calcined at 560 °C in air for 2 h, and the as-prepared samples were labeled as a MOx/SiO2, in which a was the nominal MOx content in wt % and M represented Fe, Co, or Ni. Subsequently, the supported metal oxide catalysts were sulfided in a flow of 10 vol % H2S/H2 (flow rate: 30 mL min−1) at 560 °C for 3 h and the corresponding metal sulfide catalysts were obtained, labeled as a MSx/SiO2.
Catalyst characterization
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements were performed with a Quadrasorb SI instrument (Quantachrome Corporation, USA) at liquid nitrogen temperature to determine the BET specific surface area and pore properties of the catalyst samples. To ensure complete removal of the adsorbed moisture, all samples were evacuated at 300 °C and 1.0×10−3 kPa for 4 h before the measurement. The XRD measurements of the samples was performed with an X′Pert PRO MPD diffractometer system (Philips, The Netherlands) to analyze the crystalline structure of the catalysts by using CuKα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Moreover, the H2-TPR experiment was performed to investigate the redox behavior of the samples, and detailed operational methods have been provided in our published work.24
Metal dispersion and particle size were measured through H2 pulse chemisorption with a FINESORB-3010 chemisorption analyzer (Finetec Instruments, China). The catalyst (≈0.3 g) was reduced in situ under a flow of 10 vol % H2/N2 (flow rate: 30 mL min−1) at 773 K for 1 h and then cooled to 100 °C in argon atmosphere. Then, H2/N2 was pulsed into the catalyst bed to determine metal dispersion.
To compare adsorption amounts of isobutane or isobutene over metal catalysts and the corresponding sulfide catalysts, pulse chemisorption tests were performed using the same equipment used for H2 chemisorption. The catalyst (≈0.5 g) was loaded into a quartz tube reactor. After the prereduction of oxide catalysts and pretreatment of sulfide catalysts, isobutane or isobutene (0.803 mL) was pulsed into the catalyst bed with a flow of nitrogen (flow rate: 30 mL min−1) at 300 °C. An online GAS-100Q quadrupole mass spectrometer (AVI GmbH, Switzerland) was used to detect signals of the released hydrocarbons.
To investigate the hydrogenolysis behavior of metal catalysts, the FINESORB-3010 chemisorption analyzer was adopted (a schematic of the apparatus is shown in Scheme 1). For each test, the catalyst (≈0.1 g) was loaded into a quartz tube reactor and preheated in a flow of helium (flow rate: 30 mL min−1) at 200 °C for 0.5 h. Subsequently, with a four-way valve, the helium flow was switched to a mixture of 10 vol % H2/N2 (flow rate: 30 mL min−1) to reduce the metal oxides on the support to metallic species, with the temperature increased from 200 to 560 °C (heating rate: 10 °C min−1). After the reduction process, the four-way valve was switched back to the helium flow to purge the catalyst bed. Finally, isobutane was injected into the pulse-mode reactor with a six-way valve and the gas released from the reactor was analyzed with an online GAS-100Q quadrupole mass spectrometer. Moreover, to investigate the hydrogenolysis reaction with the introduction of exterior hydrogen, after the catalyst reduction process hydrogen was fed to the catalyst bed together with isobutane without switching to helium in the pulse-mode test.
Catalytic activity test
Catalytic activity tests were performed in a conventional fixed-bed microreactor at 560 °C under atmospheric pressure, with 4 g of the catalyst loaded into the reactor. To remove adsorbed oxygen and moisture from the catalyst, a flow of nitrogen was introduced into the reactor before the reaction. During the test, a mixture of isobutane and nitrogen (molar ratio: 1:6; total flow rate: 14 mL min−1) was fed into the reactor. The compositions of the reactant and the effluent gaseous product were determined with a Bruker 450 gas chromatograph equipped with three detectors, which included a flame ionization detector to analyze the composition of hydrocarbons and two thermal conductivity detectors to measure the contents of H2, N2, CO, and CO2. In addition, the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst after the reaction was evaluated by analyzing the amount of CO2 generated during in situ coke combustion with the chromatogram. Mass balances of all tests were above 95 wt %.

Introduction
The dehydrogenation of light alkanes has attracted increased attention as an efficient route to produce alkenes from low-cost saturated hydrocarbons.1, 2 A number of commercial catalytic dehydrogenation processes have been developed for the production of propene and isobutene, which are widely used in the synthesis of polymers and gasoline-octane boosting additives.
Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are generally used in these commercial dehydrogenation processes. To increase alkene selectivity and decrease coke formation, appropriate promoters, such as Sn, K, Ca, and Li,3–6 are introduced into these catalysts. Although the catalytic performance is relatively satisfactory after the modification, the high cost of Pt and the hazardous effects of Cr6+ have unavoidably limited the use of these catalysts.
The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, an alternative route to catalytic dehydrogenation, has been studied widely owing to its thermodynamic advantages.7, 8 Previous studies have been focused on supported vanadium oxide9–12 and molybdenum oxide13–16 catalysts. Although many attempts have been made to modify the catalyst formula,17, 18 and to select mild oxidants,19–21 oxidation reactions inevitably occur, leading to increased formation of COx and inferior selectivity toward alkenes.22, 23 Consequently, it is difficult to make a significant breakthrough in this route. Therefore, the development of a cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalyst system demonstrating an excellent dehydrogenation performance in the absence of oxidants is important.24
Because CH bond activation is regarded as the rate-determining step in alkane dehydrogenation,25, 26 the mechanism of CH bond activation of the alkane and the interaction of the catalyst should be determined primarily. However, owing to the complexity of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, the activation of alkanes with transition-metal ions in the gas phase has been investigated.27–37 It has been found that CC bond insertion is more favorable on thermochemical grounds than CH bond insertion over Ni, Co, and Fe ions.31, 37
We have previously found that the introduction of sulfur into oxide catalysts of Ni and Fe inhibits cracking reactions effectively and increases dehydrogenation activity significantly.38, 39 In addition to the aforementioned catalysts, a series of metal sulfide catalysts demonstrating an excellent dehydrogenation performance, even better than that of industrial Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, has been discovered.40 Given that supported MoS2,41 CoS,42 and NiS43 catalysts are widely used in the hydrogenation reaction, and that hydrogenation and dehydrogenation are reverse reactions, the excellent dehydrogenation performance of these sulfides seems to be reasonable. However, supported sulfides of Cu, Mn, and Fe, rarely used in hydrogenation reactions, also demonstrate excellent performance. Therefore, to better understand the active sites for dehydrogenation, the reaction behavior and mechanisms of sulfide catalysts should be investigated in detail.
Herein, to explore the reasons for the remarkable improvement in the dehydrogenation performance after the introduction of sulfur, silica-supported oxide catalysts of Fe, Co, and Ni with and without sulfidation were chosen as representative samples and evaluated for the dehydrogenation of isobutane. Moreover, the dehydrogenation reaction mechanisms and the origin of catalyst deactivation over metal sulfides were systematically studied.
Results and Discussion
Structural characteristics of metal oxide and sulfide catalysts
The XRD patterns of silica-supported oxide catalysts of Fe, Co, and Ni (with a loading of 13 wt %), along with those of the corresponding sulfide catalysts, are shown in Figure 1. The diffraction peaks representative of Fe2O3, Co3O4, and NiO are observed for oxide catalysts after calcination. As for the sulfide catalysts, newly emerged diffraction peaks characteristic of the cubic structure of FeS, CoS, and NiS have been detected, indicating that sulfidation treatment can efficiently convert oxides on the catalysts to the relevant sulfides.

In addition, BET surface areas and pore-structure properties of both metal oxide and sulfide catalysts were measured to clarify whether sulfidation treatment could have destructive effects on the pore channels of the catalysts; the results are listed in Table 1. These results indicate that the catalyst surface area and pore volume decreased slightly after sulfidation and the pore diameter increased to some extent, suggesting that sulfidation treatment caused no significant damage to the catalyst structure.

Performance of metal oxide catalysts
To detect the variation trend of products more accurately during the reaction, isobutane dehydrogenation was performed over silica-supported metal oxide catalysts with a pulse-mode microreactor equipped with an online mass spectrometer; the obtained mass spectra are shown in Figure 2. As for the 13 Fe2O3/SiO2 catalyst, an increasing trend of the signal intensity was detected for isobutane (m/z=58), isobutene (m/z=56), and hydrogen (m/z=2) in several initial pulses. The signal intensity demonstrated no significant change with the increase in pulse number. Moreover, the results of the activity test in the first 10 min are summarized in Table 1. Although the ability to activate isobutane was relatively poor for the Fe-based catalyst, the selectivity toward isobutene was the highest among the three catalysts.

Mass spectra of the pulse-mode isobutane dehydrogenation over silica-supported metal oxide catalysts.
Compared with the relatively stable signal intensity observed for the 13 Fe2O3/SiO2 catalyst, the signal intensity for 13 Co3O4/SiO2 and 13 NiO/SiO2 varied significantly with pulse number. The signal intensities of hydrogen and methane (m/z=16) first increased and then decreased. In contrast, the signals corresponding to isobutane and isobutene presented an opposite variation trend; that is, the minimum signal intensities of isobutane and isobutene were achieved when the signals corresponding to hydrogen and methane reached the maximum, implying that with the increase in pulse number, the reaction first transformed from dehydrogenation into cracking and then reverted to dehydrogenation.
For the 13 Co3O4/SiO2 and 13 NiO/SiO2 catalysts, the signal intensities of both hydrogen and methane began to increase at the same pulse number. However, as for the 13 NiO/SiO2 catalyst, the signal intensities of hydrogen and methane first increased at a faster rate and then decreased at a slower rate. Moreover, consistent with the activity results summarized in Table 1, no isobutene was detected in the mass spectra of the Ni-based catalyst, indicating that the cracking ability of NiO/SiO2 was much higher than that of Co3O4/SiO2. In addition, the coke content in the first 10 min was the highest over the 13 NiO/SiO2 catalyst.
To better understand the differences in the dehydrogenation performance of the 13 Fe2O3/SiO2, 13 Co3O4/SiO2, and 13 NiO/SiO2 catalysts, temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR) experiments were performed. As shown in Figure 3, the reducibility of the three catalysts decreased in the following order: 13 Co3O4/SiO2>13 NiO/SiO2>13 Fe2O3/SiO2, which indicated that the reduction of Fe2O3 species was the most difficult. The reduction temperatures of 13 Co3O4/SiO2 and 13 NiO/SiO2 were approximately 360 and 400 °C, respectively, which suggested that Co3O4 and NiO on the support could easily be reduced below the reaction temperature of 560 °C (see the dotted line in Figure 3). However, Fe2O3 species could not be reduced completely to the metallic state at that temperature. Therefore, the steady performance of the 13 Fe2O3/SiO2 catalyst can be attributed to its relatively stable redox properties, that is, it is difficult to reduce to a metallic species at the reaction temperature. In addition, the cracking ability of the three metal-based catalysts decreased in the following order: Ni>Co>Fe.

H2-TPR profiles of silica-supported metal oxide catalysts.
According to the above results, the transformation of the reaction with time on stream over Co3O4/SiO2 and NiO/SiO2 catalysts may be attributed to the changes in surface species. During the catalysis of metal oxide on the fresh catalyst, isobutene was generated initially through the dehydrogenation reaction in spite of the low activity. Subsequently, with the reduction of oxides in isobutane atmosphere, aggregated metal ensembles were formed in situ and played a significant role in cracking reactions, confirmed earlier in the dehydrogenation of isobutane over the NiO/MgAl2O4 catalyst.38 However, the active centers for cracking were gradually covered by the large amount of coke generated, which results in weakened cracking reactions; this observation was consistent with the reported result44 that the carbonaceous species formed on the Ni particles led to a low cracking activity of the Ni/MoO3 catalyst.
Formation of methane over metal oxide catalysts
Given the considerable amount of methane generated during isobutane dehydrogenation over Fe-, Co-, and Ni-based catalysts, the route for the formation of methane should be determined. Notably, metallic Ni facilitated CC bond scission in alkanes,31, 37, 45 and Coughlin et al.46, 47 reported that large ensembles of group VIII metals were active for the hydrogenolysis reaction. Moreover, Resasco et al.48 believed that aggregated metallic Ni catalyzed the hydrogenolysis reaction of isobutane and produced large amounts of methane and coke; this finding was consistent with our results. Considering that hydrogen has been introduced into the reactor in the work of Resasco et al.,48 the question to be answered is whether methane is formed through the hydrogenolysis reaction without the introduction of hydrogen.
To answer the above question, the pulse-mode isobutane dehydrogenation over silica-supported metallic Ni catalysts with and without exterior hydrogen was performed with a homemade apparatus (Scheme 1); the method is described in the Experimental Section. In the absence of exterior hydrogen (Figure 4 a), with the increase in pulse number, the signal intensity of methane (m/z=16) demonstrated an increasing trend owing to the increase in the signal intensity of hydrogen (m/z=2). In addition, the signals corresponding to isobutane (m/z=58) and isobutene (m/z=56) were detected, even though their intensities were too weak to be observed in the original proportion. In contrast, in the presence of exterior hydrogen (Figure 4 b), the intensities of hydrogen and methane reached the maximum and remained unchanged with the increase in pulse number. At the same time, the signals for isobutane and isobutene could not be detected in the pulse-mode spectra, which indicated that isobutane was completely converted to methane through the hydrogenolysis reaction in the presence of exterior hydrogen.

In conclusion, the large amount of methane generated during the catalysis of Fe-, Co-, and Ni-based catalysts resulted from the hydrogenolysis reaction of isobutane. The hydrogenolysis reaction occurs even without the introduction of hydrogen.
Performance of metal sulfide catalysts
The catalytic performance of Fe-, Co-, and Ni-based sulfide catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation was also evaluated under the same reaction conditions, and the results are presented in Table 1 and Figure 5. Herein, turnover frequency (TOF) is defined as the moles of isobutene produced per mole of active metal atoms per hour, and the number of active metal atoms was determined through H2 pulse chemisorption. The TOF values of metal sulfide catalysts were approximately ten times larger than those of the corresponding oxide catalysts (Table 1), suggesting that the dehydrogenation performance was improved remarkably after sulfidation treatment.

Catalytic performance of silica-supported metal sulfide catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation.
As listed in Table 1, the selectivity toward isobutene increased after sulfidation treatment, which was more than 85 wt % for all metal sulfide catalysts. Moreover, the catalytic activity was maintained at a relatively high level. Isobutane conversion reached up to 71 wt % for the 13 CoS/SiO2 catalyst and decreased in the following order: 13 CoS/SiO2>13 FeS/SiO2>13 NiS/SiO2. In addition, the coke content decreased significantly after sulfidation, especially for the Ni-based catalyst (Table 1). However, the excellent dehydrogenation performance was not maintained and both the conversion of isobutane and the selectivity toward isobutene decreased as the reaction proceeded (Figure 5). Such a phenomenon reveals possible loss and consumption of the active metal sulfide during the reaction.
To characterize the catalyst deactivation rate, a deactivation index, defined as the ratio of isobutane conversion at different reaction times to the initial isobutane conversion, is used; that is, a lower value represents much faster deactivation. The deactivation index decreased in the following order: 13 CoS/SiO2>13 FeS/SiO2>13 NiS/SiO2 (Figure 6), which is consistent with the order of isobutane conversion. These results suggested that the catalyst with higher activity deactivated much faster and was probably caused by the accelerated consumption of the active metal sulfide and increased coke deposition on the catalyst. In brief, an excellent dehydrogenation performance could be achieved at the initial reaction time for the three sulfide catalysts, although minor differences existed.

Effect of the loading amount of metal sulfide catalysts
To investigate the effect of the active-component loading on the dehydrogenation performance of metal sulfide catalysts, sulfided NiO/SiO2 catalysts with different NiO loadings (0.5, 1, 5, 9, 17, and 21 wt %) were prepared and evaluated. As shown in Figure 7, isobutane conversion increased gradually with the increase in the loading amount and reached the maximum of 74.8 wt % at a NiO loading of 17 wt %. With further increase in the loading amount, a minor decrease in isobutane conversion was observed. Notably, isobutane conversion up to 54.3 wt % could still be obtained with an NiO loading as low as 0.5 wt %. However, the low amount of active species on the catalyst surface was consumed quickly; thus, the activity decreased sharply with time on stream and only 19.5 % of the initial activity was reserved after 1 h reaction. In contrast, at higher loadings, both the conversion of isobutane and the selectivity toward isobutene decreased at a much slower rate with time on stream. This decrease was probably caused by faster replenishment of the consumed surface active sites by bulk NiS species.

Catalytic performance of sulfided NiO/SiO2 catalysts with different NiO loadings for isobutane dehydrogenation.
Ni dispersion and TOF values (defined as above) of sulfided NiO/SiO2 catalysts with different NiO loadings are listed in Table 2. With the decrease in NiO loading, both surface Ni density and particle size decreased gradually and Ni dispersion increased at the same time. During this process, the formation rate of isobutene decreased slightly at first and then increased gradually and accelerated at a low loading amount. On decreasing the NiO loading to 0.5 wt % the TOF value increased to 12.38. Thus, both the activity of a single Ni atom and the utilization efficiency of Ni species on the catalyst increased with the decrease in NiO loading.

As discussed above, a relatively high conversion ability of isobutane can still be obtained over supported NiS catalysts even with a low Ni loading. However, the deficiency of the active phase in bulk leads to a sharply decreasing catalytic activity.
Origin of catalyst deactivation
As discussed above, although an excellent dehydrogenation performance can be obtained for metal sulfide catalysts, the catalyst stability still needs to be improved. Therefore, to explore appropriate measures to recover the catalytic activity, the origin of the rapid catalyst deactivation should be investigated.
Phase analysis was performed for the three sulfide catalysts after a 5 h reaction time, and their XRD patterns are shown in Figure 1 c. For the spent 13 FeS/SiO2 catalyst, the intensity of diffraction peaks characteristic of FeS decreased as compared with those for the fresh sulfide catalyst. For the other two spent sulfide catalysts, Co9S8 and Ni3S2 emerged instead of the original CoS and NiS, respectively, which suggested the loss of sulfur during the reaction. Although the pathways of sulfur loss were different for the three sulfide catalysts, the loss of sulfur probably caused the deactivation of the catalyst.
An online mass spectrometer was also used to detect the released gases during isobutane dehydrogenation over the 13 NiS/SiO2 catalyst. In addition to the dehydrogenation product, a signal corresponding to H2S (m/z=34) was detected (data not shown). This observation confirms the loss of sulfur during the reaction as well as suggesting that it was lost mainly in the form of H2S, which is consistent with our previous report of isobutane dehydrogenation over Ni/MgAl2O4 catalysts.38
To supplement sulfur and recover the activity of the spent sulfide catalysts, a sulfidation treatment was performed for another 3 h after the 5 h reaction, and a total of five sulfidation–reaction cycles were performed. The initial conversion of isobutane and selectivity toward isobutene obtained in different cycles over the three sulfide catalysts are shown in Figure 8. Notably, the catalytic performance could be completely recovered after each sulfidation, demonstrating that sulfidation treatment is an appropriate approach to maintain the activity of metal sulfide catalysts. Moreover, isobutane dehydrogenation over metal sulfide catalysts, along with a co-feed of H2S (2 mL min−1), was performed. As shown in Figure 9, isobutane conversion decreased to some extent in the initial reaction period and then the catalytic performance remained relatively steady, with an isobutene yield greater than 50 wt % for all three samples in the continuous 7 h reaction. This finding indicated that high catalytic performance for dehydrogenation can be maintained with online replenishment of sulfur, which again demonstrated the importance of sulfur.

In addition to sulfur loss, coke deposition inevitably occurred and possibly contributed to catalyst deactivation. The temperature-programmed oxidation by oxygen (O2-TPO) test of the spent NiS/SiO2 catalyst was performed to investigate the coke deposited during the reaction; meanwhile, an online mass spectrometer was used to detect the released CO2 (m/z=44), and the result is presented in Figure 10 a. The appearance of two distinct peaks (327 and 464 °C) corresponding to CO2 formation during the coke-burning process indicated that at least two types of coke species existed on the catalyst.

Mass spectra obtained during O2-TPO and H2-TPR of different NiS/SiO2 catalysts.
Full recovery of the activity of the catalyst through sulfidation not only indicated that sulfur loss was one reason for the catalyst deactivation, but also meant that coke deposition could probably be eliminated through sulfidation with H2S/H2. To investigate the above speculation, the H2-TPR test of the spent NiS/SiO2 catalyst was performed, and the corresponding MS spectra are shown in Figure 10 b. The appearance of methane (m/z=16) during the H2-TPR process suggested that the presence of hydrogen eliminated the coke deposition to some extent. After the H2-TPR test, the O2-TPO test of the spent catalyst was performed, and the corresponding mass spectra are shown in Figure 10 c. Compared with the spent catalyst without the H2-TPR process (Figure 10 a), the high-temperature peak in the mass spectra was generally retained; however, the low-temperature peak disappeared. These results revealed that the deposition of coke species burnt at low temperature (below 400 °C) was probably the other cause of catalyst deactivation whereas coke species burnt at high temperature had little effect on the catalytic activity.
Reaction mechanisms
Compared with the corresponding oxide catalysts, the remarkable improvement in the dehydrogenation performance of metal sulfide catalysts is surely not only caused by the modification of physicochemical properties (adsorption–desorption and redox behaviors, etc.), but can also be fundamentally attributed to the emergence of metal sulfides, which have been speculated to be the active sites of sulfide catalysts for dehydrogenation.38
According to the literature, the hydrogenolysis reaction of alkanes is structure sensitive49–51 and requires a large amount of aggregated metal sites to constitute the active phase.48 It is also believed that the hydrogenolysis activity is closely related to the size of metal particles.52–56 Dalmon and Martin54 reported that at least nineteen neighboring Ni atoms on the catalyst surface are necessary for the hydrogenolysis of butanes. Over Fe-, Co-, and Ni-based catalysts, the aggregated metallic sites formed in situ led to the generation of a large amount of methane owing to the hydrogenolysis reaction. Moreover, with the decrease in loading amount, the size of metal particles decreased and thus the activity of the hydrogenolysis reaction also decreased.38 Nevertheless, the dehydrogenation reaction seems to be structure insensitive, which is reflected by the high initial isobutane conversion over the sulfided Ni-based catalyst with NiO loading as low as 0.5 wt %. Moreover, Biloen et al.57 reported that the dehydrogenation reaction can be catalyzed even by a single metal-atom site.
The activity results indicated that the introduction of sulfur species played a significant role in the dehydrogenation reaction, and thus it is important to clarify how the sulfur species works. We have reported previously that the introduction of sulfur facilitated the dispersion of Ni particles on the MgAl2O4 support.38 Moreover, the existence of the metal–sulfur bond in metal sulfide catalysts weakened the interaction between metal atoms. Therefore, the effect of sulfur introduction can be explained in terms of the geometric effect, which dilutes the aggregated Ni sites on the catalyst surface and breaks large metallic Ni ensembles active for hydrogenolysis. Consequently, the occurrence of hydrogenolysis and coking reactions is reduced. Such an effect is similar to that of Sn introduction into Pt-based catalysts; Sn acts as a spacer, isolates Pt particles into smaller ensembles, reduces the deactivation rate, and increases the selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions.58, 59
In contrast, the bonding strength between the adsorbed intermediate and the catalyst surface also affected the reactivity significantly. The weak bonding interaction facilitated the desorption of the intermediate and reduced the reactivity whereas the strong bonding interaction led to the strengthened carbon–metal bond and weakened carbon–carbon bond in alkanes,60 finally resulting in an aggravated hydrogenolysis reaction and formation of methane. The adsorption amounts of isobutane and isobutene over reduced oxide catalysts (i.e., metal catalysts) and sulfided catalysts are listed in Table 3. As for metal catalysts, the adsorption amounts of both isobutane and isobutene decreased in the following order: Ni>Co>Fe, which was consistent with the order of cracking ability. Therefore, this result explained the high ability of the Ni-based catalyst for activating isobutane and the corresponding high isobutane conversion. Meanwhile, given the low adsorption amount of isobutene over the Fe-based catalyst, the formed isobutene could desorb from the catalyst promptly and the high selectivity toward isobutene could also be understood. Compared with metal catalysts, the adsorption amount of isobutane over sulfide catalysts was moderate for all three cases. However, the adsorption amount of isobutene decreased significantly after sulfidation treatment, especially for Ni- and Co-based catalysts. Such a phenomenon indicated that the introduction of sulfur facilitated the desorption of olefin; that is, the interaction between surface metal atoms and adsorbed alkene molecules was weakened by the presence of neighboring sulfur atoms. One possible reason is that a higher electron density of surface atoms, caused by the electron donation of introduced sulfur, led to more repulsive interactions with olefins. That is, the introduction of sulfur probably adjusted the electronic properties of Ni atoms, altered the nature of surface species, and decreased the adsorption heat of olefin as well as the activation energy of its desorption, consequently leading to an increased selectivity toward isobutene.

The interaction model between the isobutane molecule and the catalyst surface before and after sulfidation is demonstrated in Scheme 2. As for metal oxide catalysts, the oxides on the support are readily reduced to metal atoms during the reaction. A strong interaction between carbon atoms in isobutane molecules and the metal atoms weakens and breaks carbon–carbon bonds in isobutane and thus leads to the generation of a significant amount of methane. However, with the introduction of sulfur, the aggregated metallic species are diluted and separated, further reducing the possibility for the formation of the adjacent carbon–metal bonds in an isobutane molecule. In addition, the hydrogen atoms in isobutane molecules bond with sulfur atoms neighboring metallic species on the catalyst surface and thus the carbon–hydrogen bonds weaken and break. Subsequently, isobutene and hydrogen are released to the gas phase as the final products.

To better understand the active sites, the reaction mechanism of isobutane dehydrogenation over metal sulfide catalysts has been explored further. For example, in the NiS/SiO2 catalyst, NiS has a hexagonal structure (JCPDS no. 01-075-0613) as indicated by the XRD patterns. Moreover, for the hydrogenation reaction catalyzed by metal sulfide catalysts, the active sites are generally believed to be sulfur vacancies, that is, the coordinatively unsaturated sites.61–63 Therefore, the active Ni atom is speculated to be bonded with three sulfur atoms. Accordingly, a catalytic cycle of sulfide catalysts, including reaction, deactivation, and regeneration, is proposed, which is illustrated in Scheme 3. An isobutane molecule diffuses to the catalyst surface and dissociatively adsorbs on the coordinatively unsaturated Ni sites, forming an intermediate species (1, Figure 11) with a Ni atom bonded to the tertiary butyl group and a sulfur atom bonded to the left hydrogen atom. Through β-hydrogen transfer, a hydrogen molecule is formed and desorbs to the gas phase, leaving a labile intermediate (2, Figure 11) bonded to a π-bonded alkene. Then, an isobutene molecule is evolved and released from the catalyst surface; meanwhile, the active center is regenerated. If the NiS bond weakens, H2S is generated and released, and the Ni center with one less bonded sulfur atom (3, Figure 11) demonstrates much lower dehydrogenation activity (Scheme 3, red arrows). The catalytic activity of the spent catalyst can be recovered by sulfur replenishment through sulfidation with H2S/H2 (Scheme 3, blue arrows).

Conclusions
Silica-supported metal oxide and sulfide catalysts of Fe, Co, and Ni have been evaluated comparatively for the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane. The combined results of the activity test and catalyst characterization indicate that metal oxides, except Fe2O3 on silica, are easily reduced to metal ensembles active for alkane hydrogenolysis, which results in the formation of a large amount of methane and coke.
Metal sulfide catalysts have been prepared by sulfonation of the corresponding oxide catalysts with H2S/H2. After the introduction of sulfur, the hydrogenolysis reaction was inhibited effectively and the dehydrogenation performance was improved significantly. The selectivity toward isobutene of all the tested catalyst samples could reach up to 85 wt %, and isobutane conversion over the Co-based catalyst increased to 71 wt %. In general, the promoting effects of sulfur introduction can be understood in two ways: Firstly, the geometric effect dilutes the aggregated metallic species and inhibits the CC bond rupture; secondly the electronic effect facilitates the desorption of olefins and increases the product selectivity.
Furthermore, the mechanisms of dehydrogenation reaction, catalyst deactivation, and regeneration have been explored by using the speculated model of the interaction between isobutane molecules and sulfide catalysts. Finally, sulfur loss in the form of H2S and the deposition of coke species burnt at low temperature were determined to be the main reasons for catalyst deactivation.
Experimental Section
Catalyst preparation
Silica-supported oxide catalysts of Fe, Co, and Ni were prepared through an incipient wetness impregnation of mesoporous silica (80–180 μm) with aqueous solutions of Fe(NO3)3⋅9 H2O, Co(NO3)2⋅6 H2O, and Ni(NO3)2⋅6 H2O, respectively. The prepared catalysts were dried in air at 120 °C overnight and then calcined at 560 °C in air for 2 h, and the as-prepared samples were labeled as a MOx/SiO2, in which a was the nominal MOx content in wt % and M represented Fe, Co, or Ni. Subsequently, the supported metal oxide catalysts were sulfided in a flow of 10 vol % H2S/H2 (flow rate: 30 mL min−1) at 560 °C for 3 h and the corresponding metal sulfide catalysts were obtained, labeled as a MSx/SiO2.
Catalyst characterization
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements were performed with a Quadrasorb SI instrument (Quantachrome Corporation, USA) at liquid nitrogen temperature to determine the BET specific surface area and pore properties of the catalyst samples. To ensure complete removal of the adsorbed moisture, all samples were evacuated at 300 °C and 1.0×10−3 kPa for 4 h before the measurement. The XRD measurements of the samples was performed with an X′Pert PRO MPD diffractometer system (Philips, The Netherlands) to analyze the crystalline structure of the catalysts by using CuKα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Moreover, the H2-TPR experiment was performed to investigate the redox behavior of the samples, and detailed operational methods have been provided in our published work.24
Metal dispersion and particle size were measured through H2 pulse chemisorption with a FINESORB-3010 chemisorption analyzer (Finetec Instruments, China). The catalyst (≈0.3 g) was reduced in situ under a flow of 10 vol % H2/N2 (flow rate: 30 mL min−1) at 773 K for 1 h and then cooled to 100 °C in argon atmosphere. Then, H2/N2 was pulsed into the catalyst bed to determine metal dispersion.
To compare adsorption amounts of isobutane or isobutene over metal catalysts and the corresponding sulfide catalysts, pulse chemisorption tests were performed using the same equipment used for H2 chemisorption. The catalyst (≈0.5 g) was loaded into a quartz tube reactor. After the prereduction of oxide catalysts and pretreatment of sulfide catalysts, isobutane or isobutene (0.803 mL) was pulsed into the catalyst bed with a flow of nitrogen (flow rate: 30 mL min−1) at 300 °C. An online GAS-100Q quadrupole mass spectrometer (AVI GmbH, Switzerland) was used to detect signals of the released hydrocarbons.
To investigate the hydrogenolysis behavior of metal catalysts, the FINESORB-3010 chemisorption analyzer was adopted (a schematic of the apparatus is shown in Scheme 1). For each test, the catalyst (≈0.1 g) was loaded into a quartz tube reactor and preheated in a flow of helium (flow rate: 30 mL min−1) at 200 °C for 0.5 h. Subsequently, with a four-way valve, the helium flow was switched to a mixture of 10 vol % H2/N2 (flow rate: 30 mL min−1) to reduce the metal oxides on the support to metallic species, with the temperature increased from 200 to 560 °C (heating rate: 10 °C min−1). After the reduction process, the four-way valve was switched back to the helium flow to purge the catalyst bed. Finally, isobutane was injected into the pulse-mode reactor with a six-way valve and the gas released from the reactor was analyzed with an online GAS-100Q quadrupole mass spectrometer. Moreover, to investigate the hydrogenolysis reaction with the introduction of exterior hydrogen, after the catalyst reduction process hydrogen was fed to the catalyst bed together with isobutane without switching to helium in the pulse-mode test.
Catalytic activity test
Catalytic activity tests were performed in a conventional fixed-bed microreactor at 560 °C under atmospheric pressure, with 4 g of the catalyst loaded into the reactor. To remove adsorbed oxygen and moisture from the catalyst, a flow of nitrogen was introduced into the reactor before the reaction. During the test, a mixture of isobutane and nitrogen (molar ratio: 1:6; total flow rate: 14 mL min−1) was fed into the reactor. The compositions of the reactant and the effluent gaseous product were determined with a Bruker 450 gas chromatograph equipped with three detectors, which included a flame ionization detector to analyze the composition of hydrocarbons and two thermal conductivity detectors to measure the contents of H2, N2, CO, and CO2. In addition, the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst after the reaction was evaluated by analyzing the amount of CO2 generated during in situ coke combustion with the chromatogram. Mass balances of all tests were above 95 wt %.
