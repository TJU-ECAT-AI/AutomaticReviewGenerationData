Abstract
The catalytic behavior of iron supported on activated carbon was investigated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. CO2 was applied as oxidant. High ethylbenzene conversion (>70%) and selectivity towards styrene (>90%) were observed at 550 °C. Apart from styrene, benzene, toluene, carbon monoxide and water were formed as products.
