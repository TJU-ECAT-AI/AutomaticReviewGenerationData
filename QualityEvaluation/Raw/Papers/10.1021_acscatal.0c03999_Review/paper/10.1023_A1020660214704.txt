Abstract
The effect of the deposition of oxidative condensation products in the reaction of oxidative propane dehydrogenation in the presence of SO2 on the catalytic, acid–base, and texture characteristics of silica was studied. It was found that the oxidative condensation products exhibited high catalytic activity in this reaction. The carbonization of silica from 0 to ∼40 wt % was accompanied by an increase in the yield of propylene from 3.4 to 46 mol % (640°C; a C3H8/SO2/He + N2 mixture, 10 : 10 : 80 vol %). Further accumulation of condensation products resulted in a considerable decrease in the pore volume and radius; this imposed diffusion limitations on both propane conversion and selectivity to propane conversion products. The nature of active and deactivated condensation products was studied by DRIFT spectroscopy, diffuse-reflectance UV–VIS spectroscopy, EPR spectroscopy, XPS, thermal analysis, and electron microscopy.
