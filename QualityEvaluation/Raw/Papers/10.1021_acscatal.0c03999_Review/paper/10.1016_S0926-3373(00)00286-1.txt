Abstract
The effect of coexisting SO2 on the catalytic activity of Ga2O3–Al2O3 prepared by impregnation, coprecipitation and sol–gel
method for NO reduction by propene in the presence of oxygen was studied. Although the activity of Al2O3 and Ga2O3–Al2O3
prepared by impregnation (Ga2O3/Al2O3(I)) and coprecipitation (Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP)) was depressed considerably by the
presence of SO2, NO conversion on Ga2O3–Al2O3 prepared by sol–gel method (Ga2O3–Al2O3(S)) was not decreased but
increased slightly by SO2 at temperatures below 723 K. From catalyst characterization, SO2 treatment was found to cause two
important effects on the surface properties: one is the creation of Brønsted acid sites on which propene activation is promoted
(positive effect), and the other is the poisoning of NOx adsorption sites on which NO reduction proceeds (negative effect). It
was presumed that the inﬂuence of SO2 treatment on the catalytic activity is strongly related to the balance between the negative
and positive. The activity enhancement of Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) by SO2 was accounted for by the following consideration: (1)
increase of the propene activation ability by SO2, (2) incomplete inhibition of NOx adsorption sites by SO2. © 2001 Elsevier

1. Introduction
Selective reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in
the presence of oxygen is an important challenge for
removal of NOx emitted from diesel and lean-burn
engines. Although most of the current studies have
been related to zeolite-based catalysts such as Cu-
[1], Co- [2] and Fe-ZSM-5 [3], metal oxide-based
catalysts such as alumina-supported metal (oxide)
catalysts would be promising candidates for practical
applications because of their high stability [4].
Exhaust gases usually contain materials poisonous
to the catalysts such as H2O, SO2 and particulate mat-

ters. The reaction inhibition and poisoning of the cat-
alysts by these compounds are important issues. The
inﬂuence of H2O on the catalytic performance has
been extensively studied for several catalysts so far.
However, the effect of SO2 on the activity for NO re-
duction has not been sufﬁciently examined. In gen-
eral, two kinds of poisoning effects of SO2 are known,
namely irreversible and reversible deactivation. The
former deactivation has been observed for Al2O3 cat-
alyst for NO reduction by methanol [5]. According to
the report [5], NO conversion on Al2O3 was decreased
at the initial stage of the reaction by the presence of
SO2 but the deactivation stopped at a certain stage and
the stable activity did not depend on SO2 concentra-
tion. On the other hand, Kung et al. [6] reported that
the activity of Sn/Al2O3 for NO reduction by propene

was depressed by the presence of SO2 but could be
restored slowly after removal of SO2.
Recently, we reported the preparation of highly ac-
tive Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalyst by sol–gel method for NO
reduction by propene in the presence of oxygen [7]. It
was also found that the high activity of Ga2O3–Al2O3
prepared by sol–gel method is hardly inﬂuenced by the
presence of SO2. This high tolerance toward SO2 is
quite interesting from a practical point of view. How-
ever, its reasons still remain to be solved.
In the present work, we investigated in detail the
effect of SO2 on the activity of Ga2O3–Al2O3 pre-
pared by impregnation, coprecipitation and sol–gel
methods for NO reduction by propene in the presence
of oxygen. We will discuss here the reasons for the
high tolerance of sol–gel Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalyst to-
ward SO2 based on the reaction data as well as the
catalyst characterizations such as Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and temperature pro-
grammed desorption (TPD).
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Al2O3 was synthesized from aluminum boehmite
sol prepared by hydrolysis of aluminum(III) tri-isopro-
poxide (AIP) in hot water (363 K) with a small amount
of nitric acid. The sol solution thus obtained was
heated under reduced pressure to remove the solvents.
The residue was dried at 383 K in an oven and then
calcined at 873 K for 5 h in ﬂowing air. Ga2O3 was
prepared from gallium hydroxide which was obtained
by adding urea to an aqueous solution of gallium(III)
nitrate and stirring at 363 K for 10 h. The precipitate
thus obtained was washed with distilled water, fol-
lowed by drying at 383 K and calcination at 873 K for
5 h in ﬂowing air.
Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by three
different methods (abbreviated as Ga2O3/Al2O3(I),
Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP) and Ga2O3–Al2O3(S)). Ga2O3/
Al2O3(I) was prepared by impregnating above-men-
tioned alumina with an aqueous solution of gal-
lium(III) nitrate, followed by drying at 383 K and
calcination at 873 K for 5 h in ﬂowing air.
Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP) was prepared by coprecipitation
method, where a precipitate was produced by mix-
ing 10% NH4OH and an aqueous solution of alu-
minum(III) nitrate and gallium(III) nitrate. In this pro-
cedure, the pH of the mixed solution was kept at ca.
9. The precipitate thus obtained was washed with dis-
tilled water, followed by drying at 383 K and calcina-
tion at 873 K for 5 h in ﬂowing air.
Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) was prepared by sol–gel method.
A solution of gallium(III) nitrate dissolved in ethylene
glycol was ﬁrst added into the aluminum boehmite sol
solution produced by the same manner as described
above. After the solution was stirred at room tempera-
ture for 1 day, the solvents were eliminated by heating
under reduced pressure. The resulting catalyst precur-
sors were dried at 383 K, followed by calcination at
873 K for 5 h in ﬂowing air.
Basically, the gallium loading for Ga2O3/Al2O3(I),
Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP) and Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) was ﬁxed at
30 wt.% as Ga2O3, although Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) sam-
ples with different Ga2O3 contents from 5 to 70 wt.%
were also prepared. In this case, the samples are ex-
pressed in terms of Ga2O3(x)–Al2O3(S), where x is
the loading of Ga2O3 (wt.%).
2.2. Catalytic activity measurements
The catalytic activity was measured by using a
ﬁxed bed ﬂow reactor. A feed gas mixture contain-
ing 900 ppm NO, 900 ppm C3H6, 10% oxygen, 9.1%
H2O and helium as a balance gas was fed to 0.2 g
of a catalyst at a rate of 66 cm3 min−1 (W/F =
0.18 gscm−3). H2O was supplied with a microp-
ump. In some experiments, SO2 was introduced into
the reaction gas mixture at a concentration of 90 ppm.
In this case, the catalyst had been pre-treated at 773 K
for 12 h in a ﬂowing gas containing 900 ppm NO,
10% O2, 300 ppm SO2 and 9.1% H2O diluted in He
with a gas ﬂow rate of 66 cm3 min−1, in order to
stabilize the catalytic activity. The reaction tempera-
ture was changed from 873 to 573 K with a step of
50 K.
The analysis of the efﬂuent gas was made with two
gas chromatographs (Shimadzu GC8A) equipped with
a Molecular Sieve 5A column (for the analysis of N2
and CO) and a Porapak Q column (for that of N2O,
CO2 and C3H6). The catalytic activity was evaluated
in terms of NO conversion to N2 and that of propene
to COx (CO+CO2). The formation of N2O was found
negligible in the present work.

2.3. Catalyst characterization
The BET surface areas of the catalysts were de-
termined with a conventional ﬂow apparatus (Mi-
cromeritics Flowsorb II) by nitrogen adsorption at
77 K. The results are summarized in Table 1. The crys-
tal structure of the catalysts was identiﬁed by X-ray
diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XD-D1) measurements
using Cu K radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Elemen-
tal analysis was conducted by inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) method using a Shimadzu ICP-2000.
A self supporting sample disk of about 10 mg cm−2
prepared by pressing the catalyst powder was placed
in an IR cell with CaF2 windows. Prior to each ex-
periment, the sample disk was treated with oxygen
at 13.3 kPa for 1 h and then evacuated at the same
temperature (873 K for the fresh catalysts, 773 K
for the SO2-treated catalysts). The activated samples
were contacted with 133.3 Pa of 2,6-dimethylpyridine
(DMP) at room temperature and then evacuated at
423 K in order to estimate the band strength of the
adsorbate. In the case of the SO2-treated catalysts,
the status of SO2 accumulated on the catalyst surface
was also measured before DMP adsorption. All the
IR spectra were recorded at room temperature using
a Shimadzu FT-IR 8600PC with an MCT detector at
a resolution of 4 cm−1.
Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) exper-
iments of NOx were carried out by using 50 mg of a
sample. The sample was pretreated in a ﬂow of 10%
O2/He at 873 K (for fresh catalysts) or 773 K (for
SO2-treated catalysts) for 1 h and then cooled to 473 K
under the same gas ﬂow. NOx adsorption was per-
formed by passing a gas mixture containing 1000 ppm
NO and 10% O2 diluted in He through the sample
bed at 473 K for 1 h. After the adsorption gas was
purged with He until no NO was detected in the ef-
ﬂuent, TPD measurement was carried out up to 873 K
with a heating rate of 5 K min−1 in ﬂowing He. The
gas ﬂow rate was ﬁxed at 60 cm3 min−1. Five masses
characteristic of He (m/e = 4), NO (m/e = 30), O2
(m/e = 32), N2O (m/e = 44) and NO2 (m/e = 46)
were monitored continuously by a quadruple mass
spectrometer (ANELVA M-QA200TS) as a function
of temperature. Signal intensities were normalized us-
ing the He peak (m/e = 4). No desorption peaks were
observed for N2O (m/e = 44) and NO2 (m/e = 46)
in the present work.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performance of Ga2O3–Al2O3(S)
The activity of Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) with different
Ga2O3 content for NO reduction was examined in the
absence and presence of SO2. In the present work,
the material balance of nitrogen and carbon was as
high as 95%, indicating that little amount of carbona-
ceous materials is formed on the catalyst surface.
Fig. 1(A) shows the NO conversion obtained in the
absence of SO2 at 673, 723 and 773 K. Obviously, the
NO conversion on Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) increased with
an increase in Ga2O3 loading up to 30–50 wt.%, and
then decreased after that. This is the same result as
reported previously [8], and the high catalytic activity
of Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) is ascribed to the uniform forma-
tion of a composite oxide, [GaxAl(1−x)]2O3. As can
be seen in Fig. 1(B), the quite similar results were
obtained for NO reduction in the presence of SO2
over SO2-treated catalysts, namely, the NO conver-
sion increased with an increase in Ga2O3 loading up
to 30–50 wt.% and then decreased. It should be noted
that the NO conversion on Ga2O3(30)–Al2O3(S) at
723 K increased by SO2. Also, the NO reduction
activity of the other Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) catalysts was
hardly affected by SO2.
In order to conﬁrm the activity enhancement by
SO2, we examined the response of catalytic activity to
the supply of SO2 on Ga2O3(30)–Al2O3(S) with time

on stream at 723 K. As indicated in Fig. 2, the addi-
tion of 90 ppm SO2 increased NO conversion from 63
to 75%, and C3H6 conversion from 48 to 60%. After-
wards, stable NO conversion was obtained for more
than 20 h. Interestingly, the high level NO conversion
as much as 75% was not changed even after the re-
moval of SO2 from the reaction gas. SO2 seems to ir-
reversibly alter the features of the catalytically active
sites of Ga2O3(30)–Al2O3(S) for NO reduction.
3.2. Effect of preparation method on the catalytic
performance of Ga2O3–Al2O3

catalysts (Ga2O3/Al2O3(I), Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP) and

Ga2O3–Al2O3(S)) along with that of Al2O3 and
Ga2O3 for NO reduction by propene. Obviously, ad-
dition of Ga2O3 into Al2O3 caused a considerable
activity enhancement of Al2O3 over the entire tem-
perature range, irrespective of preparation method,
although Ga2O3 itself was not so active. Among
them, Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) showed the highest NO

reduction activity with decreasing activity in the or-
der of Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) > Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP) >
Ga2O3/Al2O3(I) > Al2O3 > Ga2O3.
Fig. 4 shows the activity of all the catalysts in the
presence of SO2. As can be seen by comparing Figs. 3
and 4, the NO reduction activity of Ga2O3/Al2O3(I),
Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP), Al2O3 and Ga2O3 was depressed
considerably by SO2, although the inﬂuence of SO2
on propene oxidation into COx was very small. The
presence of SO2 seems to cause a decrease of propene
utilization for NO reduction. In fact, the NO reduction
selectivity deﬁned as 2N2/(2CO + 3CO2) × 100 (%)
on Ga2O3/Al2O3(I) and Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP) at 723 K
decreased from 16 to 11% by the presence of SO2.
The selectivity stands for the ratio of oxygen atoms
supplied from NO to all oxygen atoms reacted with
propene to CO and CO2 [9]. On the other hand, as
described above, NO conversion on Ga2O3–Al2O3(S)
was not decreased but increased slightly by SO2 at
temperatures below 723 K. It is quite interesting that
propene conversion into COx was also increased. In
this case, no great difference in the selectivity on
Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) by the presence of SO2 was ob-
served, where the selectivity was about 17%. This sug-
gests that the enhancement of NO reduction activity
of Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) by SO2 is not due to the inhi-
bition of propene combustion by O2 which decreases
propene utilization.
There have been several reports concerning the ef-
fect of SO2 for zeolite-based [2,10] and alumina-based
catalysts [5,6,11–15] so far. Zhang et al. [16] reported
that the presence of SO2 enhances the activity of
Pt/B2O3–SiO2–Al2O3 for NO reduction by propene.
Zhu et al. [17] also reported the promotional effect of
SO2 on the activity of Ag/Al2O3 for NO reduction by
methanol in the presence of H2O. In the both cases, no
enhancement of the conversion of reducing agent was
observed by coexisting SO2, suggesting that the role
of SO2 seems to improve the utilization of reducing
agent. According to our knowledge, Ga2O3–Al2O3(S)
is the ﬁrst example for which the enhancement of NO
conversion as well as C3H6 conversion by SO2 was
observed.
3.3. Physical properties of the catalysts before and
after SO2 treatment
Table 2 compares the characteristics of the fresh and
the SO2-treated catalysts of Al2O3, Ga2O3/Al2O3(I),
Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP) and Ga2O3–Al2O3(S). A decrease
of BET surface area was observed for all the catalysts
after the SO2 treatment at 773 K for 12 h. Since the
accumulation of sulfur was recognized by elemental
analysis, the decrease of BET surface area can be as-
cribed to a blockage of the pores by the accumulated
sulfur.
Fig. 5 shows XRD patterns of the fresh and the
SO2-treated catalysts, where diffraction peaks as-
signed to -Al2O3 were observed for all the four
catalysts. XRD peaks ascribed to -Ga2O3 were also
detected
for
Ga2O3/Al2O3(I).
Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP)
and Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) showed similar XRD pat-
terns consisting of distinct XRD peaks assigned to
[GaxAl(1−x)]2O3 (x < 1) [8,18] as solid-solution
of Ga2O3 and Al2O3, although the crystallite size
in Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP) was much larger than that
in Ga2O3–Al2O3(S). It can be seen by comparing
Fig. 5(A) and (B) that no great difference in the
XRD spectra was observed between the fresh and the
SO2-treated catalysts. This means that SO2 treatment

Probably, sulfur would be present on the catalyst
surface.
In order to examine the status of sulfur accumu-
lated on the catalyst surface, FT-IR spectra of the
SO2-treated catalysts were measured. As indicated
in Fig. 6, two intense IR peaks at around 1100 and
1400 cm−1 appeared on all the SO2-treated catalysts
after the pretreatment at 773 K. Chang [19] inves-
tigated the behavior of SO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 by
using infrared spectroscopy and observed two in-
tense IR peaks at 1090 and 1390 cm−1, and assigned

these peaks to sulfate ion (SO42−). Similar IR bands
assignable to SO42−species formed on Al2O3 were
also reported by Saur et al. [20]. According to these
reports, the ν(S=O) shift between the symmetric
and asymmetric stretching modes of SO42−species
seems to be about 300–350 cm−1. In our case the
ν(S=O) shift of about 320 cm−1 was observed
for SOx-adspecies on Al2O3, Ga2O3/Al2O3(I) and
Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP), suggesting that sulfur accumu-
lated on the surface of these catalysts is in the form
of SO42−species linked to Al3+ and/or Ga3+. On the
other hand, the ν(S=O) shift on Ga2O3–Al2O3(S)

was 272 cm−1, which is smaller than that on the other
catalysts. Since the ν(S=O) shift for SO2 bounded
to metal sites is known to be about 220–250 cm−1
[19,21], SO2 species as well as SO42−species would
be formed on the surface of Ga2O3–Al2O3(S).
3.4. Inﬂuence of SO2 treatment on NOx
adsorption/desorption behavior
Nitrate adspecies formed on the catalyst surface
is known to play an important role in NO reduc-
tion [8,22–24]. Since adsorption of NOx, resulting
in the formation of nitrates (NO3−), takes place on
basic oxygen sites, SO42−-adspecies would affect ad-
sorption/desorption behavior of NOx on the catalyst
surface. Accordingly, the inﬂuence of SO2 on the
NOx-TPD proﬁles for all the catalysts was examined.
As shown in Fig. 7(A), one major desorption peak
of NO was observed at around 730 K for Al2O3 and
Ga2O3/Al2O3(I) and 710 K for Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP)
and Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) in their similar TPD proﬁles.
O2 desorption was also recognized simultaneously
with the NO desorption (not shown), suggesting
the decomposition of nitrates (NO3−) present on
the catalyst surface. As summarized in Table 3,
the amount of desorbed NO was the largest for
Ga2O3–Al2O3(S), and its value decreased in the or-
der of Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) > Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP) ≫

sample was pretreated in ﬂowing 10% O2/He at 873 K (fresh)
or 773 K (SO2-treated) for 1 h, followed by NO adsorption in
ﬂowing 1000 ppm NO/10% O2/He at 473 K for 1 h. TPD mea-

Al2O3 > Ga2O3/Al2O3(I). This tendency is in good
agreement with the NO reduction activity.
When the catalyst was treated in the reaction
gases including 300 ppm SO2, a drastic change in the
NO-TPD proﬁle was observed. As shown in Fig. 7(B),
only a broad desorption peak was detected at around
700 K only for Ga2O3–Al2O3(S). No distinct desorp-
tion peaks were observed for the other three catalysts.
Obviously, SO2 treatment of the catalysts caused a
decrease of the capability for the formation of ni-
trates (Table 3). This is probably because basic sites
on which nitrate is formed are strongly poisoned by
sulfate species which acts as an acidic probe.
3.5. Study of acid properties by infrared spectroscopy
Przystajko et al. [25] and Ziolek et al. [26] reported
that the treatment of metal oxides by SO2(+O2)
creates Brønsted acid sites. Although pyridine is of-
ten used as basic probe to distinguish Lewis and
Brønsted acid sites [27], its vibrations are much less
sensitive to perturbations involving adsorption on

weak Brønsted acid sites [28]. On the other hand,
2,6-dimethylpyridine (DMP) adsorption is a powerful
method to detect weak Brønsted acid sites because
of its high basicity and the steric hindrance of the
nitrogen atom by two methyl groups [26,29]. In order
to specify the presence of Brønsted acid sites on the
surface of SO2-treated catalysts, DMP adsorption has
been attempted.
As shown in Fig. 8(A), DMP adsorption on fresh
catalysts at room temperature followed by evac-
uation at 423 K gives rise to IR bands at 1616
and 1574 cm−1 along with the shoulder band at
1580 cm−1, which can be assigned to DMP species
interacting with strong Lewis acid sites [29,30]. It

appears that Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) has large amount of
strong Lewis acid sites on the surface. A weak IR
band at 1649 cm−1, which is due to protonated species
of DMP [29,30], is also detected on only Al2O3, in-
dicating the presence of small amounts of Brønsted
acid sites. Addition of Ga2O3 into alumina seems to
destroy the Brønsted acid sites.
Fig. 8(B) shows the IR spectra of DMP species
adsorbed on SO2-treated catalysts after evacuation at
423 K. Three distinct IR bands were detected at 1649,
1630 and 1618 cm−1. The band at 1630 cm−1 is also
due to DMP species interacting with Brønsted acid
sites. In agreement with the report of Ziolek et al. [26],
the result of the IR study suggests that SO2 treatment

increases the amount of Brønsted acid sites on Al2O3
and creates Brønsted acidity on the other catalysts. It
should be noted that no great difference in the amount
of Brønsted acid sites was observed among the cata-
lysts studied here.
3.6. Contribution of surface properties modiﬁed
by SO2 treatment to catalytic activity
The inhibition effect of SO2 on the catalytic ac-
tivity for NO reduction by hydrocarbons has been
reported for many alumina-based catalysts [5,6,14].
This negative effect of SO2 is probably due to the
strong adsorption of SO2 on the surface compared
with NO2 [31,32]. In fact, we observed considerable
depression of the catalytic activity of SO2-treated
Ga2O3/Al2O3(I) and Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP) catalysts for
NO reduction by propene in the presence of SO2
(Fig. 4). On the other hand, surprisingly, NO conver-
sion on Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) was not decreased but in-
creased by SO2 at temperatures below 723 K (Fig. 4).
The catalytic activity of Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts for
NO reduction decreased in the following order: SO2-
treated Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) > Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) >
Ga2O3–Al2O3 (CP) > SO2-treated Ga2O3–Al2O3
(CP) > Ga2O3/Al2O3(I) > SO2-treated Ga2O3/
Al2O3(I).
Characterization of SO2-treated catalysts by in-
frared spectroscopy revealed that the status of sulfur
accumulated on Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) is slightly differ-
ent from that on the other catalysts. Namely, on the
former catalyst SO2 species linked to Al3+ and/or
Ga3+ were detected in addition to sulfate (SO42−)
species, while on the other catalysts SO42−was the
only detected surface species (Fig. 6). Recently, Niwa
et al. [33] reported that the inhibition effect of SO2
on the deNOx activity of RhGaZrAlOx is related to
the formation of SO42−species but not SO2 species.
Therefore, one of the reasons for high tolerance of
Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) toward SO2 would be due to low
concentration of SO42−species compared with the
other catalysts. It should be noted that from infrared
study of DMP adsorption, SO2 treatment was found
to create Brønsted acid sites on the surface of all the
catalysts (Fig. 8).
It is well known that the selective reduction of NO
with hydrocarbons is a very complex reaction compris-
ing several parallel and/or consecutive reaction steps.
Recently, we proposed a reaction pathway of NO re-
duction by propene over Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) that nitrate
(NO3−) species formed via NO oxidation by O2 re-
acts with propene (or propene-derived adspecies), re-
sulting in the formation of N2 and COx [8]:
NO + O2 →NO2 →NO3−(ads)
(1)
C3H6 + O2 →[CxHyOz] →COx + H2O
(2)
NO3−(ads) + [CxHyOz] →N2 + COx
(3)
A similar reaction pathway would be likely for the
other catalysts, Ga2O3/Al2O3(I) and Ga2O3–Al2O3
(CP). In this reaction scheme, the formation of NO3−
species (step (1)) and the activation of propene (step
(2)) are important steps to initiate the reaction.
As can be seen in Fig. 7, NOx adsorption ability
related to the step (1) of the catalysts was consid-
erably decreased by SO2 treatment, and the amount
of desorbed NO from the SO2-treated catalysts de-
creased in the sequence of Ga2O3–Al2O3(S)
>
Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP) > Ga2O3/Al2O3(I) (Table 3).
This order is in good agreement with the catalytic
activity for NO reduction in the presence of SO2
(Fig. 4).
As described above, the creation of Brønsted acid
sites by SO2 treatment was revealed. The importance
of surface acid–base property in NO reduction has
been emphasized by many researchers [9,34–37]. It
can be expected that Brønsted acid sites play an im-
portant role for the reaction. Recently, Masters and
Chadwick [38] reported that the activation of methanol
is promoted on Brønsted acid sites created by SO2
adsorption on -Al2O3. In order to examine such an
effect of Brønsted acid sites on Ga2O3–Al2O3, the
activity of fresh and SO2-treated Ga2O3/Al2O3(I) and
Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) catalysts for C3H6 oxidation by O2
was measured. As shown in Fig. 9, the enhancement
of C3H6 oxidation activity by SO2 treatment was ob-
served for both catalysts. This result suggests that the
step (2) is accelerated on the SO2-treated catalysts
compared with the fresh catalysts because propene
can be activated by Brønsted acid sites.
From the above-mentioned results, SO2 treatment
was found to cause two important inﬂuences on the
catalytic performance: one is the poisoning of NOx ad-
sorption sites on which NO reduction proceeds (neg-
ative effect), and the other is the creation of Brønsted

acid sites on which propene activation is promoted
(positive effect). Consequently, the inﬂuence of SO2
treatment on the catalytic activity is presumed to be
strongly related to the balance between the negative
and positive effect. In the case of Ga2O3/Al2O3(I) and
Ga2O3–Al2O3(CP), NOx adsorption site is strongly
poisoned by sulfur accumulated as SO42−(step (1)),
although the activation of propene (step (2)) is pro-
moted. This leads to the decrease of selectivity for NO
reduction. In fact, the selectivity on both catalysts de-
creased from 16 to 11% by the presence of SO2. On
the other hand, nitrate formation rate of SO2-treated
Ga2O3–Al2O3(S) (step (1)) seems to be enough fast
compared with the other catalysts, because the amount
of desorbed NO was the largest for this catalyst. Tak-
ing into account the fact that no great difference in
the selectivity (ca. 17%) was observed by SO2 treat-
ment, the activity enhancement of Ga2O3–Al2O3(S)
by SO2 might be accounted for by the acceleration of
the reaction step (3) accompanied with the increase of
propene activation (step (2)).
4. Conclusion
The conclusion from the present work is that
Ga2O3–Al2O3 prepared by sol–gel method pos-
sesses high tolerance toward SO2 for the selective
reduction of NO with propene. Particularly, the ac-
tivity of Ga2O3(30)–Al2O3 at around 673–723 K was
enhanced by the presence of SO2. NOx-TPD mea-
surements and infrared study of DMP adsorption
revealed that SO2 treatment causes the inhibition of
NOx adsorption sites (negative effect) and the cre-
ation of Brønsted acid sites (positive effect). The role
of Brønsted acid sites was found to promote propene
activation. The balance between the negative and pos-
itive effect of SO2 was presumed to be the important
factor affecting the catalytic performance.
