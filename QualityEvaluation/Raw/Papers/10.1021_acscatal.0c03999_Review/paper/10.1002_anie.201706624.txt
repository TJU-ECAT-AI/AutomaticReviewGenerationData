Graphical Abstract
Gas up: Ethylene and propylene can be generated from ethane and propane, respectively, or from methane/ethane/propane mixtures, over a europium oxychloride catalyst. The reaction proceeds by oxychlorination with yields surpassing those of any existing technologies for alkene production. Its performance is preserved in technical form, and testifies to the practical relevance of this technology for the manufacture of light olefins.
Abstract
Ethylene and propylene are the key building blocks of the chemical industry, but current processes are unable to close the growing gap between demand and manufacture. Reported herein is an exceptional europium oxychloride (EuOCl) catalyst for the selective (≥95 %) production of light olefins from ethane and propane by oxychlorination chemistry, thus achieving yields of ethylene (90 %) and propylene (40 %) unparalleled by any existing olefin production technology. Moreover, EuOCl is able to process mixtures of methane, ethane, and propane to produce the olefins, thereby reducing separation costs of the alkanes in natural gas. Finally, the EuOCl catalyst was supported on suitable carriers and evaluated in extrudate form, and preserves performance for >150 h under realistic process conditions.
Vast conventional and unconventional natural gas reserves are rich in ethane and propane, thus offering the potential feedstocks to produce, respectively, ethylene and propylene, the platform molecules for the manufacture of virtually all polymers, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals.1 Currently, these olefins are produced by steam cracking, fluid-catalytic cracking, and/or catalytic dehydrogenation, all of which are highly capital- and energy-intensive and are unable to close the growing gap between their demand and manufacture.1b, 2 Thus, the replacement of these highly endothermic technologies with one-step, exothermic processes would result in enormous economic benefits.2c, 3 Towards this goal, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane,2a, 4a the partial oxidation of ethane,4b,4c and the oxidative coupling of methane4d have been extensively studied for decades as a way to attain olefins, but thus far they have not achieved commercial reality because of the lack of suitable catalysts which can achieve economically attractive yields of ethylene and propylene (<75 % and 30 %, respectively). The catalytic alkane oxychlorination route, comprising the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and oxygen, is appealing as it enables selective functionalization of the alkane under moderate reaction conditions.1a, 5 However, so far this route has mainly targeted the production of either vinyl chloride monomer or alkyl chloride, wherein ethylene and propylene were observed as a by-product with low yields of 50 and 20 %, respectively.1a, 6 The selective production of ethylene and propylene in a single step from the corresponding alkane would be highly interesting. This reaction requires the design of novel multifunctional catalytic materials which can integrate the oxychlorination of the alkane and the alkyl chloride with subsequent dehydrochlorination to yield the olefin (Figure 1).

Closed-loop chlorine-mediated process for the one-step conversion of light alkanes into ethylene and propylene.
Herein, we have investigated the gas-phase oxychlorination of ethane and propane under variable reaction conditions over different catalytic families, including, cerium oxide (CeO2), vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7), titanium oxide (TiO2), iron phosphate (FePO4), and europium oxychloride (EuOCl). The oxide and phosphate systems were selected based on their good activity and stability in methane oxyhalogenation,5b, 7a while the choice of EuOCl was based on a previous study revealing its promising performance in ethylene oxychlorination to give vinyl chloride,7b and on a recent report of EuOBr for methane oxybromination to give methyl bromide and HBr oxidation to Br2.7c The catalysts were compared by evaluating the product distribution obtained in the oxychlorination of ethane and propane at about 20 and 15 % alkane conversion, respectively (Figure 2 a,b; see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), obtained by adjusting the reaction temperature. Based on this criterion, the catalysts can be classified into three different groups. The first category is represented by CeO2, which led to the lowest yields of olefin because of the formation of chlorinated hydrocarbons and combustion products in ethane oxychlorination (EOC) and particularly in propane oxychlorination (POC). The second class, represented by (VO)2P2O7 and TiO2, achieved higher yields of ethylene with 80 and 90 % selectivity, respectively, in EOC. However, they caused pronounced formation of combustion products in POC. Finally, FePO4 and EuOCl enabled over 95 % selectivity to the alkene in both EOC and POC. EuOCl displayed the highest yields of ethylene and propylene at unaltered selectivity (Figure 3 b; see Figure S4), thus emerging as an outstanding catalyst for olefin production by oxychlorination chemistry. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and N2 sorption analyses of all materials before and after the catalytic tests showed no alterations of the crystallographic structure, but evidenced a small decrease in the total surface area (see Figure S2). We have assessed the stability of EuOCl, and demonstrated its robustness in preserving the outstanding performance for over 100 hours on stream in both EOC and POC (see Figure S3), as well as its bulk structure (see Figure S3), whereas a slight increase in the crystallinity of the sample was evidenced from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and by a small decrease in the total surface area (see Figure S3). We sampled the materials after 5 hours on stream in both EOC and POC and confirmed that the surface area stabilizes after a few hours on stream. Thermodynamic calculations show that the transformation of EuOCl into EuCl3 is highly disfavored under the operating conditions of the oxychlorination reaction (see Figure S3), and might be due to its structural arrangement of alternating halide and oxide layers, as shown in Figure 1. Finally, we conducted elemental analysis on the used catalyst and confirmed the absence of coke deposits (see Table S4).

C2H5Cl dehydrochlorination: C2H5Cl/Ar/He=1:4.5:94.5, EOC: C2H6/HCl/O2/Ar/He=6:6:3:4.5:80.5. b) Selectivity (solid symbols) and yield (open symbols) of ethylene in EOC versus the oxidizing ability of the catalyst under typical oxychlorination conditions [T10(HCl)]. The latter is measured as the temperature to attain 10 % HCl conversion in the gas-phase HCl oxidation to Cl2 (see Figure S4). Conditions: C2H6/HCl/O2/Ar/He=6:6:3:4.5:80.5. GHSV=2550–6950 h−1 (see Table S3).
Further evaluation of EuOCl under variable conditions showed the preservation of high selectivity (>90 %) over a wide range of temperatures (623–847 K), and feed concentrations of alkanes (1.5–6 vol. %), O2 (3–6 vol. %), and HCl (1–15 vol. %; Figure 2 c,d). The formation of alkenes might derive from the oxidative dehydrogenation of the alkane over the catalyst. Thus, to demonstrate the pivotal role of HCl for alkane activation and olefin generation, a test was performed in the absence of HCl. Both the alkane conversions and alkene selectivities decreased drastically (Figure 2 c,d). Interestingly, by switching from 0 to 1 vol. % of HCl, the alkane conversion, and particularly olefin selectivity, were boosted in both alkane oxychlorination reactions. Further optimization of the inlet feed enabled the attainment of the highest single-pass yields of ethylene and propylene (90 and 40 %, respectively) among any alkane-to-olefin upgrading route (Figure 2 c,d).
Olefin production from alkanes by oxychlorination chemistry stem from the integration of alkane oxychlorination to produce alkyl chloride and subsequent dehydrochlorination of the latter to yield the corresponding alkene on the catalyst surface (Figure 1). Nonetheless, these chloro derivatives were not observed over EuOCl (Figure 2 a,b; see Figure S1), and might be explained by its fast dehydrochlorination kinetics. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed ethyl chloride and propyl chloride dehydrochlorination experiments on EuOCl and FePO4 and observed that ethylene and propylene generation occurred at much lower temperature compared to that of EOC and POC, particularly in the case of europium oxychloride (Figure 3 a; see Figure S4).
To rationalize the different performance of the catalysts in EOC and POC, the gas-phase HCl oxidation to Cl2 was studied (see Figure S4) and taken as a relative measure of the oxidizing ability of the catalysts under typical oxychlorination conditions. Thus, if the temperature at which approximately 10 % HCl conversion is attained in HCl oxidation, T10(HCl), is high, the material possesses a low oxidizing character. This temperature was found to correlate linearly with olefin selectivity in EOC and POC (Figure 3 b; see Figure S4), thus suggesting that the catalysts with lower reducibility are preferred to achieve a high olefin selectivity, which is a likely consequence of the suppressed combustion reactions, as evidenced in the case of EuOCl and FePO4 (Figure 2 a,b). However, if the reducibility is too low, the olefin yield will be insufficient as seen for FePO4. EuOCl appeared to have the optimal oxidizing potential, as it achieves the highest yields of olefins in both EOC and POC (Figure 3 b; see Figure S4). Thus, the outstanding performance of this catalytic material can be rationalized by: 1) its balanced redox properties, thus enabling it to selectively functionalize the alkane and suppress undesired reactions, as well as 2) its unparalleled ability to readily dehydrochlorinate the produced alkyl chloride, which allows it to selectively yield olefins and to recover the halogen source (see Figure S5).
As a result of the increasing scarceness of oil reserves, the world is currently undergoing an unprecedented revolution in raw hydrocarbon feedstock supply, with abundant natural gas leading the charge.9 Consequently, we explored the potential of EuOCl in the oxychlorination of mixtures of methane, ethane, and propane (MEPOC; see Figure S5) to show the level of flexibility of this catalytic technology with respect to the feed composition. In this reaction, the onset temperature for propylene formation was lower than the one for ethylene, and is in line with the higher activity observed in POC compared to EOC. At 773 K, 20 and 27 % yield of ethylene and propylene, respectively, were achieved at greater than 95 % selectivity (see Figure S5). Methane conversion and COx formation were very low (<5 %). Moreover, we have investigated the effect of increased feed concentration of HCl and varying reactants ratio on the catalytic performance (see Figure S5), which show that the yields of ethylene and propylene could be improved to 30 and 40 %, respectively, at greater than 95 % selectivity. In this respect, the olefin mixture could then potentially be upgraded by established technologies to gasoline blends over zeolite or supported metal-based catalysts.10 These results show an attractive feature of the EuOCl catalyst, thus preserving the high alkene selectivity in the alkane mixture, and gives an added potential for natural gas upgrading because of its low sensitivity to feed purity.
To demonstrate the practical potential of the EuOCl-based system for olefin production, we developed a technical catalyst by dispersing europium (10 wt.%) onto millimeter-sized bodies of silicon carbide (SiC), silicon oxide (SiO2), zirconium oxide (ZrO2), and titanium oxide anatase (TiO2-a). Evaluation of the supported catalysts in EOC and POC identified EuOCl/TiO2-a as the best catalyst for ethylene production, thus enabling unaltered ethylene selectivity and higher ethane conversion compared to that of bulk EuOCl, and EuOCl/SiC as the best system for propylene production by maintaining greater than 90 % propylene selectivity and reaching 40 % propylene yield (see Figure S6). This data suggests that the carrier selection plays an important role in controlling the performance of the EuOCl phase. We conducted XRD analysis of the best catalysts for ethylene and propylene production before and after the tests (Figure 4 a,b; see Figure S7). No europium-containig phases were identified over EuOCl/TiO2-a, thus indicating its high dispersion. In contrast, reflections of the Eu2O3 phase could be distinguished in the used EuOCl/SiC sample, thus suggesting 1) lower europium dispersion, and 2) likely strong active phase–carrier interactions, which prevents the transformation of Eu2O3 into EuOCl over SiC. Transmission-electron microscopy (TEM) in high-angle annular dark-field mode (HAADF) and high-resolution TEM corroborated the high and low europium dispersion in the EuOCl/TiO2-a and EuOCl/SiC catalysts, respectively (Figure 4 c,d; see Figure S8).

The numbers in the sample code denote the molar feed ratio (C2H6/HCl/H2O/O2). f) Alkane conversion (X), product selectivity (S), and ethylene STY versus time-on-stream over EuOCl/TiO2-a extrudates in the oxychlorination of ethane. Conditions: Wcat=0.5 g, GHSV=8080 h−1, C2H6/HCl/H2O/O2/Ar/He=12:12:12:6:4.5:65.5.
Further evidence on the importance of the carrier selection comes from the alkane oxidation, and the alkyl chloride dehydrochlorination (in the presence or absence of oxygen) tests conducted over these catalysts (see Figures S9 and S10). It was found that EuOCl/TiO2-a possesses low tendency towards alkane combustion, and high activity in the dehydrochlorination of C2H5Cl, thus making it a very effective catalyst for ethylene production. In contrast, it fails in POC because of its high reactivity in combusting C3H7Cl. The low tendency to combust C3H7Cl and the alkane, together with its good activity in dehydrochlorination, makes EuOCl/SiC a better catalyst for POC.
To further demonstrate the practical relevance of the presented catalytic technology, the best ethylene producer, EuOCl/TiO2-a extrudates, was taken as representative, analyzed in greater detail, and evaluated under more demanding conditions. Microscopy measurements by scanning TEM in HAADF mode with elemental mapping by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy showed uniform distribution of europium along the extrudate before and after the reaction (see Figure S11). Mercury porosimetry indicated the preservation of the meso and macroporosity of the extrudate (see Figure S12). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the samples evidenced the presence of Eu2+ on the catalytic surface, which increased slightly after being exposed to the reaction environment (see Figure S12), thus suggesting that Eu3+/Eu2+ is an active redox couple, in line with other studies on europium-based catalysis.7c
To verify the robustness of shaped EuOCl/TiO2-a, we have studied the effect of higher reactant partial pressure and total pressure over this catalyst in EOC. A threefold increase in the concentration of reactants led to a more than three times higher ethylene space time yield (STY(C2H4)) at greater than or equal to 90 % selectivity. Likewise, upon increasing the total pressure from atmospheric pressure to 1.75 bar, a twofold increment of STY(C2H4) was achieved at greater than 90 % selectivity (Figure 4 e). Carbon elemental analysis (see Table S4) of the sample recovered after 5 hour exposure to three times higher reactant concentration demonstrated the absence of coke. Moreover, we have tested EuOCl/TiO2-a by using N2 as the carrier gas instead of He and observed that the catalytic performance was preserved.
Although today, mature technologies for HCl/H2O separation are applied in industry,11 effective and tailored methods would be required to separate water since it is a net reaction product. From this aspect, we have studied the effect of the addition of stoichiometric amounts of water to the EOC feed over EuOCl/TiO2-a. Ethylene selectivity of greater than or equal to 90 % was attained despite a small drop in productivity, which could be partially restored by doubling the partial pressure of all reactants (Figure 4 e), thus demonstrating that an operation with dry HCl is not critical to maintain an outstanding performance. Finally, we evaluated EuOCl/TiO2-a extrudates in a long-term test at higher reactant partial pressure and by using a water co-feed, and it showed its ability to retain the outstanding performance for over 150 hours as well as its mechanical, surface, and bulk physicochemical properties (Figure 4 f; see Figure S12).
In conclusion, we have discovered EuOCl as a highly promising catalyst for the one-step conversion of ethane and propane into olefins by oxychlorination chemistry, leading to the highest single-pass yields of ethylene and propylene (90 and 40 %, respectively) among any reported technology for olefin production. The performance of EuOCl was rationalized by 1) its balanced redox properties, which allow functionalization of the alkane and avoidance of combustion, and by 2) its unpaired ability to dehydrochlorinate the formed alkyl chloride to yield the olefin, thus enabling the recycling of the halogen source. Moreover, EuOCl is also able to selectively process mixtures of methane, ethane, and propane to produce ethylene and propylene. Finally, we demonstrated the scalability of the EuOCl-based catalyst in extrudate form using widely available carriers. Titanium oxide anatase was identified as the best support for ethylene production, and maintained the outstanding performance for over 150 hours on stream at both increased reactant partial pressure and by having a co-feed of water. These results have practical relevance for natural gas upgrading, and drives future research on several macroscopic engineering aspects, such as heat management, products separation (i.e. H2O, HCl, COx), reactor design etc., for further demonstration of the large-scale applicability of this catalytic technology.

GHSV=2550–6950 h−1 (see Table S3).
Further evaluation of EuOCl under variable conditions showed the preservation of high selectivity (>90 %) over a wide range of temperatures (623–847 K), and feed concentrations of alkanes (1.5–6 vol. %), O2 (3–6 vol. %), and HCl (1–15 vol. %; Figure 2 c,d). The formation of alkenes might derive from the oxidative dehydrogenation of the alkane over the catalyst. Thus, to demonstrate the pivotal role of HCl for alkane activation and olefin generation, a test was performed in the absence of HCl. Both the alkane conversions and alkene selectivities decreased drastically (Figure 2 c,d). Interestingly, by switching from 0 to 1 vol. % of HCl, the alkane conversion, and particularly olefin selectivity, were boosted in both alkane oxychlorination reactions. Further optimization of the inlet feed enabled the attainment of the highest single-pass yields of ethylene and propylene (90 and 40 %, respectively) among any alkane-to-olefin upgrading route (Figure 2 c,d).
Olefin production from alkanes by oxychlorination chemistry stem from the integration of alkane oxychlorination to produce alkyl chloride and subsequent dehydrochlorination of the latter to yield the corresponding alkene on the catalyst surface (Figure 1). Nonetheless, these chloro derivatives were not observed over EuOCl (Figure 2 a,b; see Figure S1), and might be explained by its fast dehydrochlorination kinetics. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed ethyl chloride and propyl chloride dehydrochlorination experiments on EuOCl and FePO4 and observed that ethylene and propylene generation occurred at much lower temperature compared to that of EOC and POC, particularly in the case of europium oxychloride (Figure 3 a; see Figure S4).
To rationalize the different performance of the catalysts in EOC and POC, the gas-phase HCl oxidation to Cl2 was studied (see Figure S4) and taken as a relative measure of the oxidizing ability of the catalysts under typical oxychlorination conditions. Thus, if the temperature at which approximately 10 % HCl conversion is attained in HCl oxidation, T10(HCl), is high, the material possesses a low oxidizing character. This temperature was found to correlate linearly with olefin selectivity in EOC and POC (Figure 3 b; see Figure S4), thus suggesting that the catalysts with lower reducibility are preferred to achieve a high olefin selectivity, which is a likely consequence of the suppressed combustion reactions, as evidenced in the case of EuOCl and FePO4 (Figure 2 a,b). However, if the reducibility is too low, the olefin yield will be insufficient as seen for FePO4. EuOCl appeared to have the optimal oxidizing potential, as it achieves the highest yields of olefins in both EOC and POC (Figure 3 b; see Figure S4). Thus, the outstanding performance of this catalytic material can be rationalized by: 1) its balanced redox properties, thus enabling it to selectively functionalize the alkane and suppress undesired reactions, as well as 2) its unparalleled ability to readily dehydrochlorinate the produced alkyl chloride, which allows it to selectively yield olefins and to recover the halogen source (see Figure S5).
As a result of the increasing scarceness of oil reserves, the world is currently undergoing an unprecedented revolution in raw hydrocarbon feedstock supply, with abundant natural gas leading the charge.9 Consequently, we explored the potential of EuOCl in the oxychlorination of mixtures of methane, ethane, and propane (MEPOC; see Figure S5) to show the level of flexibility of this catalytic technology with respect to the feed composition. In this reaction, the onset temperature for propylene formation was lower than the one for ethylene, and is in line with the higher activity observed in POC compared to EOC. At 773 K, 20 and 27 % yield of ethylene and propylene, respectively, were achieved at greater than 95 % selectivity (see Figure S5). Methane conversion and COx formation were very low (<5 %). Moreover, we have investigated the effect of increased feed concentration of HCl and varying reactants ratio on the catalytic performance (see Figure S5), which show that the yields of ethylene and propylene could be improved to 30 and 40 %, respectively, at greater than 95 % selectivity. In this respect, the olefin mixture could then potentially be upgraded by established technologies to gasoline blends over zeolite or supported metal-based catalysts.10 These results show an attractive feature of the EuOCl catalyst, thus preserving the high alkene selectivity in the alkane mixture, and gives an added potential for natural gas upgrading because of its low sensitivity to feed purity.
To demonstrate the practical potential of the EuOCl-based system for olefin production, we developed a technical catalyst by dispersing europium (10 wt.%) onto millimeter-sized bodies of silicon carbide (SiC), silicon oxide (SiO2), zirconium oxide (ZrO2), and titanium oxide anatase (TiO2-a). Evaluation of the supported catalysts in EOC and POC identified EuOCl/TiO2-a as the best catalyst for ethylene production, thus enabling unaltered ethylene selectivity and higher ethane conversion compared to that of bulk EuOCl, and EuOCl/SiC as the best system for propylene production by maintaining greater than 90 % propylene selectivity and reaching 40 % propylene yield (see Figure S6). This data suggests that the carrier selection plays an important role in controlling the performance of the EuOCl phase. We conducted XRD analysis of the best catalysts for ethylene and propylene production before and after the tests (Figure 4 a,b; see Figure S7). No europium-containig phases were identified over EuOCl/TiO2-a, thus indicating its high dispersion. In contrast, reflections of the Eu2O3 phase could be distinguished in the used EuOCl/SiC sample, thus suggesting 1) lower europium dispersion, and 2) likely strong active phase–carrier interactions, which prevents the transformation of Eu2O3 into EuOCl over SiC. Transmission-electron microscopy (TEM) in high-angle annular dark-field mode (HAADF) and high-resolution TEM corroborated the high and low europium dispersion in the EuOCl/TiO2-a and EuOCl/SiC catalysts, respectively (Figure 4 c,d; see Figure S8).

Further evidence on the importance of the carrier selection comes from the alkane oxidation, and the alkyl chloride dehydrochlorination (in the presence or absence of oxygen) tests conducted over these catalysts (see Figures S9 and S10). It was found that EuOCl/TiO2-a possesses low tendency towards alkane combustion, and high activity in the dehydrochlorination of C2H5Cl, thus making it a very effective catalyst for ethylene production. In contrast, it fails in POC because of its high reactivity in combusting C3H7Cl. The low tendency to combust C3H7Cl and the alkane, together with its good activity in dehydrochlorination, makes EuOCl/SiC a better catalyst for POC.
To further demonstrate the practical relevance of the presented catalytic technology, the best ethylene producer, EuOCl/TiO2-a extrudates, was taken as representative, analyzed in greater detail, and evaluated under more demanding conditions. Microscopy measurements by scanning TEM in HAADF mode with elemental mapping by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy showed uniform distribution of europium along the extrudate before and after the reaction (see Figure S11). Mercury porosimetry indicated the preservation of the meso and macroporosity of the extrudate (see Figure S12). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the samples evidenced the presence of Eu2+ on the catalytic surface, which increased slightly after being exposed to the reaction environment (see Figure S12), thus suggesting that Eu3+/Eu2+ is an active redox couple, in line with other studies on europium-based catalysis.7c
To verify the robustness of shaped EuOCl/TiO2-a, we have studied the effect of higher reactant partial pressure and total pressure over this catalyst in EOC. A threefold increase in the concentration of reactants led to a more than three times higher ethylene space time yield (STY(C2H4)) at greater than or equal to 90 % selectivity. Likewise, upon increasing the total pressure from atmospheric pressure to 1.75 bar, a twofold increment of STY(C2H4) was achieved at greater than 90 % selectivity (Figure 4 e). Carbon elemental analysis (see Table S4) of the sample recovered after 5 hour exposure to three times higher reactant concentration demonstrated the absence of coke. Moreover, we have tested EuOCl/TiO2-a by using N2 as the carrier gas instead of He and observed that the catalytic performance was preserved.
Although today, mature technologies for HCl/H2O separation are applied in industry,11 effective and tailored methods would be required to separate water since it is a net reaction product. From this aspect, we have studied the effect of the addition of stoichiometric amounts of water to the EOC feed over EuOCl/TiO2-a. Ethylene selectivity of greater than or equal to 90 % was attained despite a small drop in productivity, which could be partially restored by doubling the partial pressure of all reactants (Figure 4 e), thus demonstrating that an operation with dry HCl is not critical to maintain an outstanding performance. Finally, we evaluated EuOCl/TiO2-a extrudates in a long-term test at higher reactant partial pressure and by using a water co-feed, and it showed its ability to retain the outstanding performance for over 150 hours as well as its mechanical, surface, and bulk physicochemical properties (Figure 4 f; see Figure S12).
In conclusion, we have discovered EuOCl as a highly promising catalyst for the one-step conversion of ethane and propane into olefins by oxychlorination chemistry, leading to the highest single-pass yields of ethylene and propylene (90 and 40 %, respectively) among any reported technology for olefin production. The performance of EuOCl was rationalized by 1) its balanced redox properties, which allow functionalization of the alkane and avoidance of combustion, and by 2) its unpaired ability to dehydrochlorinate the formed alkyl chloride to yield the olefin, thus enabling the recycling of the halogen source. Moreover, EuOCl is also able to selectively process mixtures of methane, ethane, and propane to produce ethylene and propylene. Finally, we demonstrated the scalability of the EuOCl-based catalyst in extrudate form using widely available carriers. Titanium oxide anatase was identified as the best support for ethylene production, and maintained the outstanding performance for over 150 hours on stream at both increased reactant partial pressure and by having a co-feed of water. These results have practical relevance for natural gas upgrading, and drives future research on several macroscopic engineering aspects, such as heat management, products separation (i.e. H2O, HCl, COx), reactor design etc., for further demonstration of the large-scale applicability of this catalytic technology.
