Chemistry with Methane: Concepts Rather than Recipes
Graphical Abstract
Elementary steps associated with the activation of methane are addressed from experimental and computational viewpoints; what matters most are relativistic effects, two-state reactivity scenarios, and cluster-size and ligand effects, which all play a role in the organometallic chemistry of methane at ambient conditions.
Abstract
Four seemingly simple transformations related to the chemistry of methane will be addressed from mechanistic and conceptual points of view: 1) metal-mediated dehydrogenation to form metal carbene complexes, 2) the hydrogen-atom abstraction step in the oxidative dimerization of methane, 3) the mechanisms of the CH4→CH3OH conversion, and 4) the initial bond scission (CH vs. OH) as well as the rate-limiting step in the selective CH3OH→CH2O oxidation. State-of-the-art gas-phase experiments, in conjunction with electronic-structure calculations, permit identification of the elementary reactions at a molecular level and thus allow us to unravel detailed mechanistic aspects. Where appropriate, these results are compared with findings from related studies in solution or on surfaces.
1. Introduction
…︁ I believe that in twenty-five years methane will be the most popular ligand in coordination chemistry.
Joseph Chatt, 19761
While, in retrospect, Chatt’s bold prediction may be dismissed as exaggerated, there cannot possibly exist any serious doubt about the grand challenges associated with the activation and functionalization of methane.2 For example, current large-scale, economically viable processes at ambient conditions are unable to bring about direct conversion of methane to methanol [Eq. (1)], to couple this alkane with carbon dioxide [Eq. (2)], or to use methane as a hydrogen source to produce directly hydrogen peroxide or ammonia [Eq. (3) and (4)].

Clearly, a part of the difficulties is due to the intrinsic properties of the hydrocarbon, as indicated by the significant energies required for both homo- and heterolytic CH bond cleavages, the negligibly small (if not negative) electron affinity, the large ionization energy, the huge HOMO–LUMO gap, the extremely high pKa value, the absence of a dipole moment, and the rather small polarizability of CH4. All these features make the substrate rather unsuitable for ordinary redox or acid–base chemistry. Moreover, in the context of CH4 activation for the time being, tunable catalysts are not available to solve the deceptively simple problems of bond breaking and bond making or the coupling of the molecular fragments and the liberation of the product from the catalyst. Furthermore, attempts aimed at uncovering the elementary steps and elucidating mechanistic aspects associated with these transformations have proved particularly challenging.2 This deplorable situation is not really surprising and is further enhanced given the enormous complexity that prevails in “real-life situation” in which often ill-defined effects of solvents, counterions, aggregates, or surface inhomogeneities obscure a reaction center or mask the intrinsic properties of a reactive intermediate. Clearly, a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanisms, derived from atomic or molecular-level insights, is desirable if not necessary for improving existing and designing new catalysts.3
Gas-phase studies on “isolated” reactants provide an ideal arena for probing experimentally the energetics and kinetics of a chemical reaction in an unperturbed environment at a strictly molecular level. In fact, in the last two decades numerous mass-spectrometry-based experiments have been exploited to provide insight into the elementary steps of various catalytic reactions and to characterize in detail reactive intermediates that have previously not been within the reach of conventional condensed-phase techniques.4 Of course, as a result of the net Coulombic charge of the ions studied in high vacuum as well as the absence of counterions and solvation, these “naked” species will, in general, be much more reactive than their condensed-phase counterparts. Thus, gas-phase studies will, in principle, never account for the precise mechanisms, energetics, and kinetics which prevail in the condensed phase, and direct transfers of the conclusions arrived at are, in general, not warranted. Having said that, studies of this kind, performed under well-defined conditions and complemented by computational investigations, have nevertheless proved meaningful, for they provide a conceptual framework to analyze the reactions in question. In fact, the Degussa process, that is, the platinum-mediated coupling of CH4 and NH3 to generate HCN,5a may serve as a good example. Mass-spectrometry-based experiments5b–5d suggested the key role of CH2NH as a crucial transient, and the existence of this species was later confirmed by means of in situ photoionization studies.5e
In this Review, we focus our attention on four reactions, all of which are associated with the chemistry of methane (Scheme 1): metal-mediated dehydrogenation of methane, process
, oxidative dimerization of methane (ODM), process
, the methane→methanol conversion, process

2. Dehydrogenation of Methane: Relativistic and Cluster-Size Effects
[Relativistic effects] are therefore of no importance in the consideration of atomic and molecular structure and ordinary chemical reactions.
Paul A. M. Dirac, 19296
Dehydrogenation of methane (Scheme 1, process
) to generate [M]CH2 is of conceptual interest, as the methylene complex can serve as an intermediate in the metal-mediated conversion CH4→CH2O.7 To make dehydrogenation thermochemically feasible, the metal–methylidene bond strength D0(MCH2) must exceed the heat of dehydrogenation of methane [Eq. (5)].
((5))
Among “bare” transition-metal cations, this requirement is met only by some of the 5d elements, for example, M+=Ta, W, Os, Ir, and Pt.8 In fact, in contrast to their lighter 3d and 4d congeners, these cations bring about spontaneous gas-phase dehydrogenation of methane at room temperature, as first reported by Irikura and Beauchamp9 and later by others.10 The remarkable increase in bond strength from, for example, 74 kcal mol−1 (for Ni+CH2) to 111 kcal mol−1 (for Pt+CH2)11 has been attributed to a sizeable relativistic stabilization12 of the 6s orbital of M+ in these cationic complexes M+CH2, as demonstrated for M=Pt by fully relativistic, four-component Dirac–Fock–Coulomb benchmark calculations including correlation effects.8, 13 Actually, up to 40 % of the bond strength in Pt+CH2 is due to a relativistic contribution.8, 12, 13b
Armentrout and co-workers have extended the earlier work9 and performed extensive experimental and computational studies for the systems M+/CH4 (M=Re,11b W,14 Ir,15 and Ta16). Most interesting is their finding that in the course of dehydrogenation, in particular to form the insertion intermediate HM+CH3, a spin–orbit-mediated switch from the high-spin ground state to the low-spin excited surface is crucial. As will be shown later in a different context, this scenario of a two-state reactivity (TSR) pattern,17 in which excited states play a pivotal role, is a hallmark of many transition-metal-mediated processes.
TSR matters also in the unexpected thermal gas-phase dehydrogenation of CH4 by main-group atomic As+.18 As shown in Figure 1, in the course of the reaction the ground-state triplet asymptote of the couple As+ (3P0)/CH4 undergoes a crossover to the excited singlet surface at a minimal-energy crossing point (MECP) located between the encounter complex As-2 and the oxidative addition intermediate As-3. If the system stayed on the triplet ground-state surface, insurmountably high transition states (e.g. As-TS3–4 or As-TS4–5) would have to be overcome. Instead, it is the very spin-flip that opens up a reaction channel for a thermal process which would not be accessible at all for the reactants. Interestingly, as shown by a comparison of Figures 1 a and b, scalar relativistic effects, however, do not affect the energetics in this particular system. Finally, in the thermal dehydrogenation of methane by the doubly-charged metal ion Ta2+ 19a or the actinide species Th, Th+, and Th2+,19b–19f a TSR scenario has also been invoked.

Admittedly, bare metal cations have been rightly considered as extreme “reagents”, and the findings derived from their reactions in the gas phase have little relevance to processes in solution or on surfaces—clearly, the reductionist principle in simplifying the complexity that prevails in reality has been stretched a bit too far. More appropriate models are clusters, and collections of cluster have been suggested as the reactive sites on surfaces.20 In fact, size-selected unsupported neutral platinum clusters not only react with methane but also exhibit a remarkable size dependence in the dehydrogenation of CH4, and the analysis reveals that coordinative unsaturation is of crucial importance.21 A related behavior has also been observed for free charged Ptn+/− clusters (n=1–21) which, in addition to pronounced size effects, exhibit the following trends: 1) Cationic clusters, owing to their electrophilic character and to the mechanism of CH bond activation, are generally more reactive than their anionic counterparts, with the reactivity of a given neutral platinum cluster falling between those of the charged systems; 2) with increasing cluster size the reactivity drops.22 The anomalously low reactivity of Pt4+[22] has been traced back to the lack of a thermochemical driving force.23c In the room-temperature reactions of cationic heteronuclear MPt+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au) or of the homonuclear Rh2+ clusters, dehydrogenation of CH4 is also facile.5c,5d, 23
A notable cluster-size effect in the context of catalytic methane activation was reported by Bernhardt, Landman, and co-workers.24 While atomic ground-state Au+ (1S0) is entirely unreactive towards methane,25 isolated Au2+ clusters mediate CC coupling of methane at increased substrate pressure to yield ethane [Eq. (6)].
((6))
In this experimental and computational study, approximately 106 mass-selected Au2+ ions were confined to an ion trap (which acts, so to speak, as the gas-phase chemist’s test tube) for a few hundred microseconds in CH4/He mixtures at a pressure of about 1 Pa and a temperature that was varied between 200 and 300 K. These experimental conditions permit derivation of the catalytic cycle depicted in Scheme 2, which was completely characterized in terms of the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Several features are noteworthy. 1) Owing to the rather high pressure applied, reaction intermediates were collisionally stabilized and thus accessible; further, the temperature variation permitted the study of endothermic processes. 2) These findings illustrate an oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) at ambient temperature. 3) In the multicollision experiment, methane is not only involved as a reactant but also serves as a ligand to release C2H4 from the Au2+ catalyst. 4) Working at higher pressure removes the problem of the so-called “pressure gap” between the high vacuum and condensed phases, which often hampers model studies in their “relevance” for understanding real catalysis.3b, 26 As to some of the facets contained in Scheme 2, the first barrier ΔE1, surpassed only at temperatures above 250 K, is encountered in the sequence of CH bond activation, making an HH bond, and the elimination of H2. A second barrier (ΔE2) must be involved in the release of C2H4 from the intermediate Au2(C2H4)(CH4)+, because this intermediate is observed between 250 and 270 K, but not at 300 K. Finally, a third barrier (ΔE3) is associated with the cluster degradation. As stated in a Highlight article,27 these findings, in addition to their fundamental importance, are likely to be of practical importance in the design of catalysts.

Finally, it should be mentioned that coupling of methane to produce C2H4 has also been realized in a cluster-assisted σ-bond-activation reaction. Here, atomic Ti+, at elevated CH4 pressure, undergoes CH bond activation and oxidative coupling of the CHn (n=2, 3) fragments in Ti(CH4)m+ clusters (m≥4) at thermal energies.28, 29
3. Hydrogen-Atom Abstraction from Methane: The Very First Step in the Lunsford Mechanism of Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM)
Much of the research on the direct conversion of methane has been devoted to this reaction, which involves the catalytic conversion of methane and oxygen to ethane and water [Eq. (7)] at elevated temperature (above 650 °C).2d, 30
((7))
The fundamental aspects of the problem involve both a heterogeneous component, which includes the activation of CH4 on (usually doped) metal oxide surfaces, and a homogeneous gas-phase part; in the latter, coupling of the free methyl radicals and subsequent dehydrogenation (C2H6→C2H4) occurs. Much of the current debate31 centers around the nature of the active metal oxide surface species, which, according to Lunsford’s suggestion,30b, 32 corresponds to an oxygen-centered radical (Scheme 3). However, no controversy exists as to the rate-limiting step of OCM, and the consensus view assigns this role to the initial homolytic scission of the CH bond of methane.33

Perhaps the most compelling evidence for the role of oxygen-centered radicals in the hydrogen-atom abstraction step by metal oxides [Eq. (8)], as well as mechanistic insight into the elementary steps of the reaction with an emphasis on the detailed role of [M], have been provided by gas-phase studies of mass-selected, electronic ground-state metal oxide ions. These include not only the transition-metal-based oxides OsO4+.,9a FeO+.,34 MnO+.,35 MoO3+.,36 V4O10+.,37 TiO2+.,38 ZrO2+.,38 and their oligomeric clusters39 but also main-group-element oxides, for example, MgO+.,40 MO+. (M=Ca, Sr, Ba),41 PbO+.,42 non-metallic SO2+.,43 mixed metal/non-metal clusters PnV4−nO10+. (n=1, 2, 4),44 the bimetallic oxide AlVO4+.,45 as well as the oligomeric clusters (Al2O3)n+. (n=3–5).46 Common to all these systems are the following features: 1) A very efficient homolytic CH bond activation according to Equation (8) achieved at room temperature; this activation is a consequence of a favorable thermochemistry, as the hydrogen affinities of these element oxide species exceed the CH bond strength in methane, and 2) without exception, according to the theoretical studies, all element oxide radical ions exhibit high spin densities at a terminal oxygen atom.
((8))
The crucial role of an oxygen-centered radical is demonstrated by the following experimental observations and computational findings. 1) For the oligomeric clusters (Al2O3)n+. (n=3–5) only those clusters react spontaneously at room temperature according to Equation (8) that have an even number of aluminum atoms (Al6O9+., Al8O12+., and Al10O15+.); clusters that contain an odd number of aluminum atoms (Al7On+ (n=9, 10, 11) and Al9On+ (n=13, 14)) lack a radical center and do not exhibit any reactivity towards CH4.46 2) In contrast to the open-shell cluster Al3VO7+., whose spin is not located at a terminal oxygen atom, the related system AlVO4+. brings about efficient homolytic cleavage of the CH bond of CH4 at room temperature. DFT calculations indicate that the hydrogen-atom transfer is exclusively confined to the terminal AlO and not the VO unit, as it is the former group at which the spin is located (Figure 2).45a Similarly, in the mixed PnV4−nO10+. clusters (n=1, 2) or the heteronuclear vanadium silicon oxide radical cation clusters, the radical site is located at the terminal PO or SiO units.44b,44c, 45b 3) Finally, while H-atom abstraction from the closed-shell system CaO/CH4 is calculated to be slightly exothermic, the barrier of the process is insurmountably high;47 this behavior very much contrasts with that of the rather reactive CaO+./CH4 couple.41

As to the mechanism(s) of the hydrogen-atom abstraction from CH4, two conceivable scenarios have been identified, that is, a direct pathway (“harpoon” mechanism) and an indirect process in which the hydrogen delivery from the carbon atom to the oxygen atom is mediated by the metal atom. Convincing examples for both scenarios are known, with SO2+., AlVO4+., and PnV4−nO10+. (n=0, 1, 2, 4) belonging to the former and MgO+., PbO+., MnO+., FeO+., and MoO3+. to the latter. Both mechanistic variants will be presented below.
In the gas-phase reaction of the polynuclear oxide cluster V4O10+. with methane,48 no long-lived encounter complex V4O10+./CH4 seems to exist; rather, in a barrier-free process (Figure 3) the hydrogen atom is pulled away to produce, in a rather exothermic reaction, the intermediate [V4O9OH]+⋅⋅⋅CH3., from which the loosely bound CH3. is liberated.37

The evolution of this efficient process (60 % of the collision rate), which is associated with an intramolecular kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 1.35,37, 49 has been confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (Figure 4 and Figure 5). For the first 450 fs of the simulation, the potential energy decreases steadily, driven only by the small attractive forces between methane and the cluster ion, which is indicative of a barrier-free reaction. In parallel, the OH and VC distances decrease steadily, and the CH distance increases. After 450 fs, when the system has gained approximately 24.5 kcal mol−1 internal energy, energy is transferred into the CH and OH stretching modes, corresponding to oscillations of the hydrogen atom between the vanadyl oxygen atom and the methyl carbon atom. Further, the VC distance decreases until t=470 fs and then slowly increases again, thus indicating the beginning of the expulsion of the CH3 radical.

The fluctuations after 450 fs result from vibrational motions, mainly of the OH group (adapted from Ref. 37).
The progress of the reaction can also be seen by inspection of the calculated spin densities shown in Figure 5. In the initial-state structure (a), the spin density is similar to that of the isolated V4O10+. cluster and only insignificantly more delocalized. Structure (b) describes the situation after 443 fs; the OH and CH distances are nearly identical, and the spin density is distributed between the vanadyl oxygen atom and the carbon atom and is polarized along the O-H-C axis. Finally, in the product (c), the spin is completely transferred to the methyl radical.

Room-temperature activation of CH4 by diatomic MgO+. may serve as an example for a “metal-mediated” hydrogen abstraction; such homolytic bond cleavage is also a hallmark of the reactions of CH4 with PbO+., MnO+., FeO+., and MoO3+. As shown in Figure 6, the reaction commences with the generation of an encounter complex CH4⋅⋅⋅Mg2+⋅⋅⋅O−. in which the spin is almost exclusively located at the oxygen atom. Next, the methane molecule migrates around the magnesium atom toward the oxygen atom, delivery of a hydrogen atom occurs, and the newly formed methyl group is pulled back to the magnesium core. The thus formed H3C⋅⋅⋅Mg+OH intermediate represents a complex between a loosely bound methyl radical, which carries more than 98 % of the spin, and protonated magnesium oxide. From this intermediate, CH3. is liberated in an entropy-driven dissociation; formation of the thermochemically more favored product combination Mg+./CH3OH by a rebound mechanism is kinetically less attractive.40

Finally, in the context of homolytic CH bond cleavage reactions, a brief comment seems befitting about using kinetic isotope effects as an experimental probe to classify reaction mechanisms. As already mentioned, direct hydrogen abstraction from CH4 is characterized by rather small KIEs, whereas those homolytic CH bond cleavages which are mediated by the metal core exhibit larger KIEs, typically greater than 2.0. Moreover, as discussed by Schröder et al. in detail,50 for a given reaction type there exists a relationship between the size of the KIEs and the overall rate coefficients of the hydrogen-atom abstraction from methane. For example, the intermolecular KIE, derived from the reactions with CH4 and CD4, continuously increases from about 1.3 for MgO+. via 2.1 and 2.4 for CaO+. and SrO+., respectively, to 3.2 for BaO+..41 This trend of increasing KIEs is paralleled by a decrease of the overall rate coefficients for the activation of methane, for example, from 3.9×10−10 for MgO+. and 2.9×10−10 for CaO+. to 9.8×10−11 and 1.1×10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for SrO+. and BaO+., respectively.41, 50 With regard to catalysis, this observation implies that the less reactive oxidants exhibit higher selectivities in terms of the associated KIEs, apparently in line with the time-honored Bell–Evans–Polanyi principle.51
4. The Conversion of Methane to Methanol: A Long-Time Conundrum Resolved at Long Last by the Two-State Reactivity Concept
Dem Anwenden muss das Erkennen vorausgehen.
Max Planck, 191952
Planck’s comment on the decision to award the Nobel Prize for Chemistry (1918) to Fritz Haber, and repeated at the annual meeting of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft on October 29, 1919 in a different context, does not only serve to this very day as a precept of Germany’s Max-Planck-Gesellschaft but also summarizes Haber’s exceptional skill in bridging the gap in the natural sciences between theory and application. In Bernal’s words, Haber was “the greatest authority in the world on the relations between science and industry”.53
Perhaps the largest potential for a major advance in methane conversion technology is in the discovery of a direct route to the formation of methanol and formaldehyde at ambient conditions,2 and it is not unjustified to relate Sir Derek Barton’s famous dictum2a about “Holy Grails in Chemistry”54 to the oxygenation of CH bonds in alkanes, for example, the reaction in Equation (1), given the complexity of this deceptively trivial reaction, which looks easy only on paper.55, 56 In reality, there are quite a few challenges, as for example:
1)
the unbalanced stoichiometry: there is one oxygen atom too many in Equation (1);
2)
the overoxidation challenge: both intermediates CH3OH and CH2O are kinetically more prone to further oxidation than the starting molecule CH4 with its thermochemically strong and kinetically inert CH bond;
3)
the spin dilemma: since CH4 and CH3OH possess singlet ground states, the reaction is spin-forbidden when O2 is used as terminal oxidant.
1
Nature has solved these riddles in the evolutionary development of the methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzyme, which contains at the reaction center a structurally relatively simple, doubly oxygen-bridged diiron cluster.57 MMO has served chemists as an enticing example of what could possibly be achieved, and FePO4 is an interesting in vitro model for the production of CH3OH and CH2O when H2 is added to CH4 and O2.58 The two oxidation products are formed with selectivities of 23 and 45 %, respectively, but only at a disappointingly low methane conversion level of about 0.6 %. Similarly unsatisfying with regard to a large-scale, economically attractive, environmentally benign functionalization of CH4 were the mechanistically appealing experiments of Periana et al., which made use of bipyrimidyl-substituted platinum(II) complexes,2i, 59a in analogy to Shilov’s seminal studies employing platinum compounds dating back to the mid-20th century,60 or Au0-based oxidations of CH4 with H2SeO4.59b With regard to practical applications, however, experiments which employ platinum-based solid catalysts are more promising.59c,59d
A rewarding insight into the mechanisms—and thus the underlying obstacles encountered in the numerous, often frustrating solution-phase and surface-based experiments—has been derived in the last two decades from a happy marriage between sophisticated gas-phase experiments of mass-selected, electronic-ground-state metal oxide cations MO+ and computational studies. Only some of the more fundamental aspects from this rather extensive work61 will be addressed here. First, it should be mentioned in passing, without discussing this fascinating topic in any further detail, that the understanding of the simple gas-phase reaction, depicted in Equation (9a), has later proved helpful in the clarification and elucidation of the mechanisms of the intricate cytochrome P450 mediated hydroxylation of hydrocarbons as well as in providing a rationale for the competitive H-atom abstraction versus O-atom transfer of nonheme iron(IV) oxide oxidants.62
(9)
In the stoichiometric gas-phase model reactions of MO+ with CH4, three principal product channels are conceivable [Eq. (9)], and the experimentally determined rate coefficients and branching ratios are controlled by thermochemical and spin considerations; Reaction (9c) is usually reserved for oxides that contain 5d metals.7 In this Section, we will focus on features that are of particular relevance for the reaction shown in Equation (9a), in which the insertion intermediate H3CM+OH is key. Although the metal has the formal oxidation state MIII in both MO+ and H3CM+OH, there are fundamental differences in the bonding situations, which have important consequences. Thus, 3d and 4d metals cannot effectively support π-type double bonds in MO+, which consequently leads to high-spin ground states for the MO+ monocations. In contrast, the insertion intermediates primarily involve σ-type bonding, for which perfect pairing and thus low-spin ground states are preferred. Therefore, a situation results, in which the spin surfaces cross each other such that the reaction pathway of lowest energy demand must involve a crossover from the high-spin to the low-spin surface and eventually back to high spin in the final products. In fact, the analysis of the reactions of bare metal oxide cations in the gas phase led, among other things, to the development of the paradigm of two-state reactivity (TSR).17c,17d, 62, 63 The TSR scenario is now widely accepted in various areas of science far beyond gas-phase-ion chemistry, for example in organometallic chemistry64 and also in the context of metalloenzymes.62
The (simplified) potential-energy surface for the reaction of bare FeO+ with CH4 (Figure 7) may serve as an illustrative example. After having formed an encounter complex (CH4)FeO+, spin–orbit-mediated coupling brings about a switch from the high-spin sextet ground state to an excited quartet state;34e, 65 only in this spin state is formation of the insertion intermediate H3CFe+OH via TS1 thermochemically possible under ambient conditions, and it is the spin change that avoids the high-energy TS1 on the ground-state sextet surface.

Thus, as stated above, excited states are involved in a thermal reaction. As pointed out by Poli and Harvey,64a it is only because of a spin change that these reactions occur at all under ambient conditions. The essence of the idea of a TSR scenario is depicted in Figure 8, and it represents the key element of “spin catalysis”: a (thermal) reaction is accelerated by a spin change which, by avoiding energetically less attractive transition structures, opens up favorable pathways.

While the details of the PESs for CH bond oxygenation by MO+ depend very much on the nature of the transition metal M in MO+, excellent agreement has been arrived at for the thermal reactions of MO+ (M=Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) with CH4 when compared with computational studies.4a, 34a,34b, 35a,35b, 66 Several notable, general trends are as follows: First, the early 3d transition-metal oxides ScO+, TiO+, VO+, CrO+, and MnO+ have low-spin ground states. This characteristic alters the PESs such that the intersystem crossing does not occur in the vicinity of TS1 (Figure 7) but instead closer to TS2. As the ground states of the products are high-spin systems, only one spin flip is necessary. Next, the reactions of ScO+, TiO+, and VO+ with CH4 to produce CH3OH are endothermic owing to the enormous D0(M+O) values (greater than 135 kcal mol−1), which substantially exceed the oxygen-atom affinity of CH4 to produce CH3OH (90.7 kcal mol−1). Further, as the O-atom transfer from CrO+ is only slightly exothermic, none of these oxides bring about thermal activation of CH4.
For MnO+, the exothermicity of its reaction with methane already suffices to break the CH bond and to generate H3CMn+OH; next, this intermediate liberates a methyl radical in a spin-allowed, entropically favored process; the spin-forbidden rebound step, with subsequent CH3OH loss, is not competitive. The two late-transition-metal oxides CoO+ and NiO+, when treated with CH4, undergo spin inversion close to the entrance channel; an additional spin flip at the elimination of CH3OH is not required, because the ground state of the resulting metal ions is of the 3dn configuration. The experimentally observed significant differences in the reaction coefficients (more than a factor of 20 in favor of NiO+) in generating CH3OH from CH4 and MO+ (M=Co, Ni) are due to details of the PESs close to the insertion step as well as to different spin–orbit coupling factors. Finally, according to the calculations, CuO+ is predicted to be one of the most powerful hydrocarbon oxidants among all binary 3d metal oxide cations; however, as a consequence of its small bond-dissociation energy, D0(Cu+O)=37.4 kcal mol−1, to date all attempts to generate the reagent in the gas phase and to subject it to the stoichiometric or catalytic conversions of methane have failed. [See however the Addendum.]
The genuine gas-phase catalytic oxidation CH4→CH3OH by MO+ was realized quite some time ago for FeO+ 34a and, more recently, for NiO+ and PdO+.67 On the basis of computational and experimental studies, it was shown that NiO+, owing to its easy availability and high selectivity, is a rather promising candidate, and experiments that use NiO- or FeO-doped zeolites as catalyst for the oxygenation of CH4 under ambient conditions are also encouraged by computational and (for iron and copper) experimental investigations.68
5. On the Detailed Mechanisms of CH3OH→CH2O Oxidation
While most of the roughly 40 million metric tons of methanol processed annually are converted into a variety of diverse chemical products,2k the leading among them is formaldehyde, which is also one of the top 25 chemicals produced worldwide.2k, 69 Here, we focus on some mechanistic aspects of the conversion CH3OH→CH2O, and the relevant questions in this context center around the following topics: 1) In the initial step (Scheme 4) does a metal-based mediator [M] preferentially induce a cleavage of the stronger OH bond (102.4 kcal mol−1) or the weaker CH bond (91.7 kcal mol−1), and 2) for a given sequence of events, which of the two hydrogen-transfer steps constitutes the rate-determining one? These questions will be addressed first by describing reactions of methanol with neutral atoms under matrix-isolation conditions, on surfaces, or in the gas phase when treated with bare or ligated ions. Subsequently, examples of genuine gas-phase catalysis will be presented, and, finally, a brief comparison will be made between model systems and a real catalyst.

Pathways for a metal-mediated methanol–formaldehyde conversion.
5.1. The Initial Step: Cleavage of the Strong OH versus the Weaker CH Bond
In all matrix-isolation studies, often complemented by computational exercises, for the reactions of methanol with neutral atoms (M=Fe,70 Si,71 B,72 Be,73 Mg,73a Sc,74 Ti,75 or Mn70a) upon annealing or photochemical activation, the encounter complexes M(CH3OH) undergo, in a kinetically controlled fashion, specific activation of the stronger OH bond (path
Scheme 4) to produce the corresponding [M]OCH3 species.76 Similarly, the numerous experimental investigations, employing the whole arsenal of contemporary advanced surface-spectroscopy techniques, combined with elaborate computational studies of the reactions of methanol on supported metal oxides, demonstrate that the “methoxide pathway”
is preferred.77 These studies, which, among other things, also deal with the role of support effects, formal oxidation states of the metal oxides, and selectivity effects caused by the atomic structures of the surfaces, further reveal that in the sequence CH3OH→[M]OCH3→CH2O the second step, that is, the CH bond activation in the methoxy intermediate, constitutes the rate-limiting one.77 In a rather detailed computational investigation, the kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the CH3OH→CH2O conversion using titania-supported vanadates were addressed, and the following main conclusions were drawn:78
1)
Methoxy species are key intermediates in the reaction, with a tetrahedral vanadia unit containing a vanadyl group, a methoxy group, and two bridging V-O-Ti sites forming the most stable one. A fivefold-coordinated vanadia unit was found to be potentially interesting for catalytic reactivity.
2)
The rate-limiting step in the oxidation mechanisms corresponds to the transfer of a hydrogen atom from the [V]OCH3 intermediate to the catalyst oxygen site VO (barrier of 41.0 kcal mol−1) or to a bridging interface unit V-O-Ti (barrier 46.0 kcal mol−1). Both pathways involve spin crossings from the singlet to the triplet potential-energy surfaces, involving TSR scenarios.
However, and perhaps not entirely unexpectedly, a change in mechanism can occur when methanol oxidation is brought about by oxide-free surfaces. For example, in the oxidative CH3OH decomposition on Pt(111), according to periodic, self-consistent DFT calculations, the rate-limiting step is now assigned to initial OH bond activation to produce a methoxy-bound intermediate.79 Other computational work80 arrived at the conclusion that CH bond scission contributes to the first and rate-limiting step in the Pt(111) decomposition of CH3OH; while this process is favored by 12 kcal mol−1 as compared with an initial OH bond activation (Figure 9),80a neither decomposition route for methanol can compete with the desorption of the intact substrate from the surface.

A change in mechanism has also been noted in the electrochemical decomposition of CH3OH on platinum surfaces; a KIE of 3 for the system CH3OH/CD3OH and its absence for the CH3OH/CH3OD couple, together with other data, were interpreted in favor of the “hydroxymethyl pathway” (
in Scheme 4).80, 81 Finally, initial CH rather than OH bond cleavage is computationally predicted to be favored in methanol activation on sub-nanometer Pd clusters.82
Numerous gas-phase experiments with both cationic and anionic reagents, bare or ligated atoms, and clusters of different sizes and varying stoichiometries have been conducted over the last three decades and aimed at revealing the mechanisms of CH3OH→CH2O conversion at a strictly molecular level. While highly remarkable cluster-size effects,83g–83k,83n,83q the role of formal oxidation states,83q or anomalously large kinetic isotope effects have been observed,83e most of these studies83 did not provide a clear-cut mechanistic distinction between initial OH versus CH bond scission (Scheme 4). Preferred OH bond activation, however, is suggested for the system FeO+/CH3OH according to experimental data84a and supported by DFT calculations.84b Similarly, mass-selected cations FeX+ (X=OH, F) undergo a clean reaction with CD3OH [Eq. (10)],85a while the related NiX+ systems (X=OH, F, Cl, Br) effect both OH and CD bond activation of CD3OH; the branching ratio is strongly ligand-dependent.85b For example, Ni(OH)+ prefers OH bond activation, but the complex NiBr+ preferentially activates the CD bond of CD3OH.85b Finally, in the initial phase of the reaction of VO3− with methanol, extensive labeling experiments and computational studies indicate that specific activation of the OH group prevails as well.86
((10))
Unambiguous examples for an initial CH bond activation are rather scarce; for example, the gas-phase reaction between Mn(CO)3− and methanol commences with the rate-limiting CH bond cleavage of the substrate,86a and in the reaction of Con+ (n=4, 5) cluster ions with CD3OH, only D2 is liberated.86b For the oxidation of methanol by ferrate (FeO42−), numerous pathways were considered computationally, and it appears that CH and OH bond scissions compete with each other.87 This prediction, including computed KIEs to distinguish between different mechanistic scenarios, calls for an experimental verification. For the dehydrogenation of CH3OH by mononuclear vanadium oxide cations, in line with the experimental findings, calculations clearly favor a reaction path that is initiated by activation of a CH bond in the course of which the metal’s oxidation state does not change (Scheme 5); moreover, spin changes from the ground-state triplet surface to the excited singlet manifold do not matter in this particular system, as the two electronic ground states are well-separated energetically and do not cross.88

The mechanisms of the CH3OH→CH2O oxidation by the Fenton reagent were studied by Baerends and co-workers at the DFT level89 both in the gas phase by considering microsolvated clusters and in aqueous solutions. Two competing mechanisms were identified, in line with the dual nature of the reagent: 1) A direct one in which the high-valent FeIVO2+ moiety homolytically abstracts a hydrogen atom from the methyl group (path
in Scheme 4) and 2) a coordination mechanism in which after complexation the OH bond of the substrate is cleaved heterolytically to generate initially an Fe(OCH3) species (path
in Scheme 4). As expected, given the nature of highly charged systems, solvent effects matter, with the consequence that the energy barriers calculated are quite sensitive to changes of the microenvironment.89
A strongly metal-dependent, alternating activation of CH versus OH bonds of methanol occurs when the gas-phase species are generated upon electrospray ionization of methanolic solutions of MX2 (M=Fe, Co, Ni; X=Br, I).90–92 As shown in Figure 10, in the iron system selective activation of the hydroxy group of the ESI solvent prevails; in contrast, nickel salts activate the CH bond, and for the cobalt complexes an intermediate situation is encountered.90a

Combining the labeling data (Figure 10) with structure-specific collision experiments of the [M,C,H3,O]+ product ions provides evidence for the exclusive formation of Fe(OCH3)+, Ni(CH2OH)+, and a mixture of Co(OCH3)+ and Co(CH2OH)+ with a preference for the methoxy complex.90a Interestingly, a mixture of Rh(OCH3) and Rh(CH2OH), with comparable RhO and RhC bond dissociation energies, has also been obtained from treating rhodium(I) porphyrines with methanol.90b
Mechanistic insight into the origin of the bond-selective, metal-dependent CH3OH activation has been gathered from extensive DFT calculations and by experimentally establishing the precursors from which the [M,C,H3,O]+ species originate upon ESI of MX2/CH3OH solutions.90a, 92 For iron, the Fe(OCH3)+ product is due to sequential evaporation of up to eight CH3OH molecules from Fe(OCH3)(CH3OH)n+ (n≤8), and the latter is generated by solvolysis of FeX2 by the nucleophilic CH3OH solvent. Moreover, high-spin Fe(OCH3)+ is, according to DFT calculations, 16.6 kcal mol−1 more stable than the quintet isomer Fe(CH2OH)+. For the co-generation of isomeric [Co,C,H3,O]+, two pathways have been identified. One, leading to the methoxy complex Co(OCH3)+, is analogous to that for the iron system starting from Co(OCH3)(CH3OH)n+ (n≤8). However, this precursor, in competition with sequential CH3OH evaporation, also undergoes loss of CH2O and CH3OH to generate Co(H)(CH3OH)+. This intermediate, in a spin-allowed elimination involving the CoH bond and a hydrogen atom from the methyl group of CH3OH, then decomposes to a quartet state of Co(CH2OH)+ which is 6.0 kcal mol−1 higher in energy than ground-state Co(OCH3)+ having the same multiplicity. For the exclusive generation of Ni(CH2OH)+ two pathways were identified, both involving Ni(X)(CH3OH)+ (X=H, Br) as immediate precursors; in the subsequent evaporation of HX, the hydrogen atom originates from the methyl group of CH3OH. DFT calculations (Figure 11) are not only consistent with the experimental observations but also explain why Ni(CH2OH)+ is formed rather than the thermochemically slightly more favorable Ni(OCH3)+ isomer. Here, the crucial point is that starting from ground-state triplet Ni(H)(CH3OH)+ (36), the spin-allowed reaction to produce 3Ni(OCH3)+ via 3TS6/7 cannot compete energetically with a reaction which, after spin inversion 36→16, proceeds via 1TS6/8 toward 1Ni(CH2OH)+.92

Both structures 7 and 37a correspond to Ni(OCH3)(H2)+ complexes, with the HH bond parallel and perpendicular to the NiOC plane, respectively; no bond activation is involved in 3TS7/7a. 3TS8a/8 corresponds to a haptotropic metal shift from the oxygen atom to the carbon atom of the CH2OH ligand. Relative energies are given in kcal mol−1 (adapted from Ref. 92).
Finally, the celebrated Ni(H)(OH)+ species93 in the reaction with CD3OH undergoes exclusive loss of HD, thus pointing to a clean activation of the methyl CD bond.85b
5.2. Genuine Catalytic Cycles in the Gas-Phase Oxidation of Methanol
A conceptually rather attractive scheme for the Fe+-catalyzed oxidation of methane that involves the conversion of CH4 into CH2O by O2 in the presence of CH3OH as a co-catalyst will be discussed first.55, 94 Oxygen-atom transport may proceed both in the formation of CH2O from CH3OH with O2 as the O-atom donor for atomic Fe+ and in the oxidation CH4→CH3OH with FeO+ [Eq. (11)–(13)], .

((13))
The key gas-phase experiments that mimic the overall Reaction (13) are summarized in Equations (14)–(17), , , . The 〈O〉 equivalent of the reaction shown in Equation (11) is provided by FeO+. Since FeO+ cannot be generated directly from the Fe+/O2 couple on thermochemical grounds,95 the decisive experiment is a methanol-mediated activation of dioxygen in which the alcohol serves as a co-reductant [Eq. (16)]. While this process is quite exothermic (ΔrH=−24 kcal mol−1), the rate efficiency is only about 10 % as a result of spin barriers.84, 85, 96
((14))
((15))
((16))
((17))
A combination of the steps in Equations (14)–(17) leads to a viable sequence for the Fe+-mediated oxidation of CH4 to generate CH2O according to Equation (13). Here, the CH3OH molecule coordinated to the metal plays a central role both as a precursor for the oxidation product CH2O and as a crucial intermediate in the activation of O2. Furthermore, the co-formation of FeO+ in Reaction (16) is quite remarkable in that over-oxidation (namely, the formation of Fe+ and HCOOH) does not occur in this experiment, although bare FeO+ rapidly reacts with formaldehyde.97 The seemingly most simple step in Scheme 6, that is, the mere complexation of the iron cation by methanol [Eq. (17)], however, does not take place in the low-pressure regime (typically below 10−7 mbar). However, the magnitude of k17 can be enhanced with increasing pressure through ternary collisions.

A completely different, rather interesting example has been reported by O’Hair and co-workers, who studied computationally and experimentally the reaction of VO3− with CH3OH in the gas phase, including the re-oxidation of the catalyst.98 The first step of the reaction corresponds to the addition of methanol so that the methoxy group coordinates directly to the vanadium atom and the hydrogen atom of the OH group interacts with one of the oxygen atoms of VO3− (Scheme 7). In the second step, another hydrogen atom from the methyl group migrates to the newly formed hydroxy group, which leads to a complex of VO2−, water, and formaldehyde. This complex loses preferentially H2O. Formaldehyde is subsequently replaced by molecular oxygen, and this step represents the reoxidation of VIII back to the VV catalyst. The subsequent coordination of another methanol molecule proceeds in analogy with the first step, but the oxidation of the methoxy group to formaldehyde this time is not associated with the formation of a water molecule but with the reduction of the η2-peroxy ligand. Elimination of the thus formed formaldehyde and subsequent water loss leads to the regeneration of the VO3− catalyst.

For the binuclear anionic dimolybdate clusters shown in Scheme 8, two gas-phase cycles have been identified, and in both cycles Mo2(O6)(OCHR2)− (R=H, alkyl) acts as a central intermediate.99 Three steps matter: 1) condensation of [Mo2O6(OH)]− with the alcohols R2CHOH and elimination of water to produce an alkoxo-bound cluster; 2) oxidation of the alkoxo ligand and its liberation as an aldehyde or a ketone in a step which is rate-limiting and requires the supply of external energy through collisional activation; 3) regeneration of the catalyst by oxidation with nitromethane. The second cycle is similar, but differs in the order of the reaction with the alcohol and the use of nitromethane as the terminal oxidant.

links Mo2O6(OCH3)− and Mo2O5(OH)− and appears in both cycles, which differ in the sequence of the reactions with CH3NO2 and CH3OH (adapted from Ref. 99).
The role of the binuclear metal center was assessed by examination of the relative reactivities of the mononuclear MO3(OH)− and binuclear M2O6(OH)− complexes (M=Cr, Mo, W). The molybdenum and tungsten binuclear centers (M=Mo, W) were reactive towards alcohols, but the chromium complex was not; this finding is consistent with the order of basicity of the hydroxo ligand in these anionic complexes. However, the tungsten complex W2O6(OCHR2)− prefers a redox-neutral elimination of an alkene rather than oxidation of the alkoxo ligand to form an aldehyde or a ketone. This observation is in keeping with the oxidizing power of the anions. Interestingly, each of the mononuclear anions MO3(OH)− (M=Cr, Mo, W) was inert to reaction with methanol, which highlights the importance of the second MO3 unit in the catalytic cycles. Clearly, only the bimolybdate center has the appropriate balance of electronic properties that allows it to participate in each of the three steps; these gas-phase studies with well-defined cluster anions correspond to the unique role of molybdenum(VI) trioxide (MoO3) in the industrial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde at 300–400 °C.100
Finally, the dinuclear manganese oxide cations Mn2O2+ and Mn2O+ were also found to act as catalysts in the gas-phase oxidation of CH3OH.101 As in the previous system, input of external energy (collisional activation or heating) is, however, essential for at least one of the reaction steps to close the catalytic cycle for the Mn2On+ (n=1, 2) oxides.
5.3. Comparison of a Model System with a Real Catalyst
While most of the gas-phase experiments rely on charged systems and therefore are somewhat limited in scope, in an in silico experiment, that is, computations, the intermediates and transition states assumed to be involved in a catalytic cycle do not suffer from this limitation; in addition, the structural complexity of the species can be modified at will and adjusted to both the gas-phase models and the real catalyst. Here, we will describe some aspects of the CH3OH→CH2O conversion for which silica-supported vanadium oxides serve as real catalysts. This reaction has also been studied in the gas phase in quite some detail using VO(OCH3)3+ and larger vanadium oxide clusters as models,83r, 88, 102 and extensive computational work also exists.77h, 103 The computed reaction sequence commences with adsorption of the substrate on the surface, the latter having a presumed vanadyl-site structure VO(OSi)3 (Figure 12). This step is associated with the cleavage of one of the VOSi bridges and provides VO(OCH3)(OSi)2 and HOSi sites. Next, a hydrogen atom from the methoxy group is transferred to the terminal vanadyl oxygen atom, which results in the formation of formaldehyde. The model compound VO(OCH3)3 thus mimics an intermediate in which two methoxy groups represent the missing OSi links to the silica support, while the remaining part is realistic. In the singly charged state, the model corresponds to the VV oxidation state with a radical site located at the oxygen atom of the VO unit; rearrangement leads to the VIV radical species coordinated to formaldehyde (Figure 12). The overall reaction within this distonic radical cation is exothermic. The energy barrier predicted at the B3LYP level (ca. 19 kcal mol−1) is slightly overestimated, as revealed by a comparison with the threshold photoionization study of the dissociation of VO(OCH3)3+; the latter suggests a barrier of about (13±2) kcal mol−1. The same model reaction in the neutral state shows similar results as far as the geometry and the formal oxidation states of the vanadium sites of intermediates and products are concerned; however, the corresponding reaction step is endothermic, as are experiments with real catalysts. Thus, in this case, while the charged model provides hints as to the reaction mechanism and suggests possible structures of intermediates, it cannot be taken as a reliable guide for energetic considerations.103a

Different models for a vanadyl site of a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst for the CH3OH→CH2O conversion, as calculated using B3LYP/TZVP; relative energies are given in kcal mol−1 (adapted from Refs. 4n, 103b).
As a further test for the relevance of such simplified models, a comparison of VO(OCH3)3 with larger model compounds, such as the dimer of VO(OCH3)3, VO[OSi(OH)3]3, or vanadyl silsesquioxane (Figure 12) has been made. The dimer of VO(OCH3)3 exhibits a reactivity that is qualitatively analogous with that of the monomer. The next two models, VO[OSi(OH)3]3 and silsesquioxane, offer the possibility to study the first reaction step, that is, the adsorption of methanol on the catalyst. This step leads, in the case of the VO[OSi(OH)3]3, to free Si(OH)4, which is stabilized by the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds.104 As this option is not available in a real catalyst, this model overestimates the adsorption energy (21 kcal mol−1). In the case of the vanadyl silsesquioxane complex, the addition of methanol to the model catalyst is accompanied by the formation of an integrated OSi(H)(OH)O unit, and therefore, the results can be expected to be more accurate. Accordingly, the adsorption energy drops substantially to 9.6 kcal mol−1. Next, hydrogen rearrangement within the OVO(OCH3)O unit occurs, and the activation energy for this step is calculated to be around 48 kcal mol−1 for the VO[OSi(OH)3]3 model and 48.5 kcal mol−1 for silsesquioxane. Final optimization using the broken-symmetry approach, correction for the spin contamination, and the inclusion of zero-point vibrational energy lowers the energy barrier to 37 kcal mol−1 (Figure 12). This value is in rather good agreement with the experiments conducted with real systems; therefore, the model approach appears adequate.103a, 104
Other examples for using gas-phase experiments with “isolated” reagents as models for mimicking reactions in the condensed phase include 1) the Degussa process, that is, the platinum-mediated coupling of methane and ammonia to generate HCN,5 2) the mechanistic understanding of the Cytochrome P450 mediated CH bond oxygenation62, 63 based on a detailed analysis of the most simple system, that is, FeO+/H2,63, 96 or 3) the relationship between the rich gas-phase chemistry of bare PtO2+[105] and the extraordinary features exhibited by high-valent platinum oxides,106 just to mention a few.
6. Conclusions
It remains a source of frustration to know so much about the reactions of transition-metal ions with hydrocarbons and yet have so many questions remain unanswered.
Peter B. Armentrout, Jack L. Beauchamp, 1989107
On this rather depressing note, Armentrout and Beauchamp concluded their superb review on the fundamental aspects of gas-phase organometallic chemistry. Considering the difficulties encountered at that time in elucidating mechanistic aspects of reactions occurring at a single metal center, it was not surprising that processes of higher complexity involving clusters, surface reactions, and metal catalysts were considered as “largely shrouded in mystery”.107 However, things have changed since the landmark paper of Allison, Freas, and Ridge in 1979108a about the first example of gas-phase activation of alkanes by “naked” transition-metal ions, the seminal Kappes–Staley report108b on genuine, homogeneous gas-phase catalysis by bare Fe+, and the Armentrout–Beauchamp review in 1989107—and, fortunately, things have changed for the better! This is in no small part due to the breath-taking instrumental improvements (laser desorption, electrospray ionization, Smalley-type cluster-ion sources, multipole analyzer, ion traps, gas-phase ion spectroscopy, ion-mobility experiments, or ion-electron diffraction, to name but a few) which permit experiments which were thought of as simply impossible two decades ago. Structures of gaseous, medium-sized species of any charge state can now be routinely identified spectroscopically and thus form a reliable starting point for reactivity studies.109 Conceptually, the development of new mechanistic paradigms, such as two-state reactivity17 or appreciating the role of relativistic effects12–14 in bond-activation processes, has removed some of the mysteries and are now considered relevant in several areas far beyond the field of gas-phase organometallic chemistry.62, 64 Further, the inclusion of ligated systems4j,4m,4n, 110 not only extends beyond the world of “idealized” naked-atom chemistry; these systems also serve as more realistic models for reactive species or intermediates that are capable of activating methane in the condensed phase, as do the exciting cluster studies aimed at mimicking surface reactions.4a,4g,4k,4l,4n, 22, 24, 48b,48c, 83, 111 A major breakthrough certainly was driven by computational chemistry. While open-shell, electronically and coordinatively unsaturated transition-metal systems still pose non-trivial problems,112 the progress made in the last two decades is nearly unparalleled—and that applies not only to gas-phase studies113 but extends also to the most complex surface reactions.31a, 114 Actually, the quality of contemporary computational studies is such that theoretical work no longer only complements or explains experimental findings after the fact; rather, theory occasionally challenges experimentalists by predicting the fleeting existence of particularly reactive species which have not yet been generated.115
There is indeed good reason to argue that an integrated approach, as intended and already realized to some extent by UniCat,116 will also help to cope with the persisting challenges associated with the activation of small molecules, for example, methane or carbon dioxide.117 Thus, at long last, bridging the gap between chemistry conducted at an atomic level in the gas phase and the most complex behavior at surfaces118 or in solution119 seems possible, provided scientists do not ignore Gerhard Ertl’s gentle reminder about the relationship between the simple and the complex, as depicted in Figure 13.120

7. Addendum
Since the submission of this review article, numerous publications have appeared which have a bearing on the topics discussed here. Among these studies, together with a few articles which were not included originally, the following ones deserve brief mentioning.
An exhaustive review on the role of organometallic intermediates on the active centers in surface-mediated CH bond activation has been published by Coperét,121 and the state-of-the-art of theoretical descriptions of surface reactions, aimed at engineering the electronic structure of the active surface sites, forms the focus of a review by Norskøv et al.122
With regard to the dehydrogenation of methane (Scheme 1, process
) by singly or doubly charged actinide ions (An+ or An2+), the role of 5f electrons and orbitals has been analyzed both computationally and experimentally.123 Of particular importance is the finalizing that the insertion efficiency to produce CAn2+H or CAn+H species is related to the energy needed to promote the An+/An2+ ions from their ground state to a prepared divalent state with two non-5f-valence electrons.124 In addition, in the exothermic reaction of, for example, Th2+ with CH4, a spin crossing from the ground-state triplet reactant to the excited singlet surface of the products is necessary to bring about thermal dehydrogenation. Possible origins of the anomalously low reactivity of Pt4+ towards CH422,23d has been discussed at great length using DFT-based calculations.125
In the context of homolytic CH bond cleavage [Eq. (8)], quite a few studies have been performed recently. In addition to the hydrogen-atom abstraction from CH4 by PbO+.,42 the congeners GeO+. and SnO+. exhibit parallel behavior both in terms of efficiencies and kinetic isotope effects.126 Extremely insightful experimental and computational studies on this topic were conducted by He, Ding, and co-workers.127 This work once more underlines the crucial role that oxygen-centered radicals play in the hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT), irrespective of the charge state; in fact, the calculated spin density at the terminal oxygen atoms in cluster oxides could be correlated with the observed rate constants, and evidence was presented how, by a proper choice of the chemical composition of the cluster oxides, a fine tuning of the spin density can be achieved.127b These findings, together with those described in Section 3, are of quite some importance in the conceptual understanding of HAT in solution. Here it has been suggested128 that “the presence of unpaired spin density at the abstracting atom is not a requirement for, or a predicator of, HAT reactivity”,128a and that HAT is better described by a coupled electron/proton transfer, that is, H.≅e-+H+. In the latter, the electron is transferred to the highly electrophilic metal (often in a high oxidation state), and the proton to the basic (oxygen) ligand. As far as gas-phase reactions are concerned, without any exception, thermal HAT requires the presence of unpaired spin density at the abstracting oxygen atom. This view is also supported by the recently described CuO+./CH4 couple.129 Here, the ground-state triplet of CuO+. with a spin density of 1.68 at the oxygen atom brings about, at room temperature, HAT with an efficiency of 20 % and an intramolecular KIE of 2.6. The competing CH4→CH3OH conversion, having an efficiency of 31 %, occurs after a triplet–singlet switch, that is, the CuO+./CH4 system demonstrates spin-selective reactions in the thermal activation of methane.
For the CH4→CH3OH conversion, several new articles addressing different aspects of this problem have also surfaced recently. Gunnoe and co-workers describe in a minireview strategies and fundamental advancements,130 the identification of reactive intermediates by matrix-isolation infrared spectroscopy has been reviewed by Wang and Zhou,131 theoretical aspects of the cytochrome P450 mediated methane oxidation form the subject of articles by Hu et al.132a and the Shaik group,132b tuning a P450 enzyme by protein engineering has been reported by Reetz and co-workers,133 and, finally, the role of Fe-doped zeolites68 in the oxidation of CH4 by N2O was reported as early as 1998.134
For the mechanism of the CH3OH→CH2O oxidation (Section 5), the work of Mavrikakis and co-workers135 is worth mentioning; the authors present a microkinetic model together with detailed experimental studies on the platinum-mediated decomposition of CH3OH and demonstrate that the reaction commences with scission of the CH bond, according to Scheme 4, path
; this step is also rate-limiting. For iron–vanadate catalysts, often employed for this reaction, in recent studies the nature of the catalytically active site has been identified, and it was shown that OH bond activation (Scheme 4, path
) initiates the methanol oxidation.136, 137

1. Introduction
…︁ I believe that in twenty-five years methane will be the most popular ligand in coordination chemistry.
Joseph Chatt, 19761
While, in retrospect, Chatt’s bold prediction may be dismissed as exaggerated, there cannot possibly exist any serious doubt about the grand challenges associated with the activation and functionalization of methane.2 For example, current large-scale, economically viable processes at ambient conditions are unable to bring about direct conversion of methane to methanol [Eq. (1)], to couple this alkane with carbon dioxide [Eq. (2)], or to use methane as a hydrogen source to produce directly hydrogen peroxide or ammonia [Eq. (3) and (4)].

Clearly, a part of the difficulties is due to the intrinsic properties of the hydrocarbon, as indicated by the significant energies required for both homo- and heterolytic CH bond cleavages, the negligibly small (if not negative) electron affinity, the large ionization energy, the huge HOMO–LUMO gap, the extremely high pKa value, the absence of a dipole moment, and the rather small polarizability of CH4. All these features make the substrate rather unsuitable for ordinary redox or acid–base chemistry. Moreover, in the context of CH4 activation for the time being, tunable catalysts are not available to solve the deceptively simple problems of bond breaking and bond making or the coupling of the molecular fragments and the liberation of the product from the catalyst. Furthermore, attempts aimed at uncovering the elementary steps and elucidating mechanistic aspects associated with these transformations have proved particularly challenging.2 This deplorable situation is not really surprising and is further enhanced given the enormous complexity that prevails in “real-life situation” in which often ill-defined effects of solvents, counterions, aggregates, or surface inhomogeneities obscure a reaction center or mask the intrinsic properties of a reactive intermediate. Clearly, a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanisms, derived from atomic or molecular-level insights, is desirable if not necessary for improving existing and designing new catalysts.3
Gas-phase studies on “isolated” reactants provide an ideal arena for probing experimentally the energetics and kinetics of a chemical reaction in an unperturbed environment at a strictly molecular level. In fact, in the last two decades numerous mass-spectrometry-based experiments have been exploited to provide insight into the elementary steps of various catalytic reactions and to characterize in detail reactive intermediates that have previously not been within the reach of conventional condensed-phase techniques.4 Of course, as a result of the net Coulombic charge of the ions studied in high vacuum as well as the absence of counterions and solvation, these “naked” species will, in general, be much more reactive than their condensed-phase counterparts. Thus, gas-phase studies will, in principle, never account for the precise mechanisms, energetics, and kinetics which prevail in the condensed phase, and direct transfers of the conclusions arrived at are, in general, not warranted. Having said that, studies of this kind, performed under well-defined conditions and complemented by computational investigations, have nevertheless proved meaningful, for they provide a conceptual framework to analyze the reactions in question. In fact, the Degussa process, that is, the platinum-mediated coupling of CH4 and NH3 to generate HCN,5a may serve as a good example. Mass-spectrometry-based experiments5b–5d suggested the key role of CH2NH as a crucial transient, and the existence of this species was later confirmed by means of in situ photoionization studies.5e

2. Dehydrogenation of Methane: Relativistic and Cluster-Size Effects
[Relativistic effects] are therefore of no importance in the consideration of atomic and molecular structure and ordinary chemical reactions.
Paul A. M. Dirac, 19296
Dehydrogenation of methane (Scheme 1, process
) to generate [M]CH2 is of conceptual interest, as the methylene complex can serve as an intermediate in the metal-mediated conversion CH4→CH2O.7 To make dehydrogenation thermochemically feasible, the metal–methylidene bond strength D0(MCH2) must exceed the heat of dehydrogenation of methane [Eq. (5)].
((5))
Among “bare” transition-metal cations, this requirement is met only by some of the 5d elements, for example, M+=Ta, W, Os, Ir, and Pt.8 In fact, in contrast to their lighter 3d and 4d congeners, these cations bring about spontaneous gas-phase dehydrogenation of methane at room temperature, as first reported by Irikura and Beauchamp9 and later by others.10 The remarkable increase in bond strength from, for example, 74 kcal mol−1 (for Ni+CH2) to 111 kcal mol−1 (for Pt+CH2)11 has been attributed to a sizeable relativistic stabilization12 of the 6s orbital of M+ in these cationic complexes M+CH2, as demonstrated for M=Pt by fully relativistic, four-component Dirac–Fock–Coulomb benchmark calculations including correlation effects.8, 13 Actually, up to 40 % of the bond strength in Pt+CH2 is due to a relativistic contribution.8, 12, 13b
Armentrout and co-workers have extended the earlier work9 and performed extensive experimental and computational studies for the systems M+/CH4 (M=Re,11b W,14 Ir,15 and Ta16). Most interesting is their finding that in the course of dehydrogenation, in particular to form the insertion intermediate HM+CH3, a spin–orbit-mediated switch from the high-spin ground state to the low-spin excited surface is crucial. As will be shown later in a different context, this scenario of a two-state reactivity (TSR) pattern,17 in which excited states play a pivotal role, is a hallmark of many transition-metal-mediated processes.
TSR matters also in the unexpected thermal gas-phase dehydrogenation of CH4 by main-group atomic As+.18 As shown in Figure 1, in the course of the reaction the ground-state triplet asymptote of the couple As+ (3P0)/CH4 undergoes a crossover to the excited singlet surface at a minimal-energy crossing point (MECP) located between the encounter complex As-2 and the oxidative addition intermediate As-3. If the system stayed on the triplet ground-state surface, insurmountably high transition states (e.g. As-TS3–4 or As-TS4–5) would have to be overcome. Instead, it is the very spin-flip that opens up a reaction channel for a thermal process which would not be accessible at all for the reactants. Interestingly, as shown by a comparison of Figures 1 a and b, scalar relativistic effects, however, do not affect the energetics in this particular system. Finally, in the thermal dehydrogenation of methane by the doubly-charged metal ion Ta2+ 19a or the actinide species Th, Th+, and Th2+,19b–19f a TSR scenario has also been invoked.

Admittedly, bare metal cations have been rightly considered as extreme “reagents”, and the findings derived from their reactions in the gas phase have little relevance to processes in solution or on surfaces—clearly, the reductionist principle in simplifying the complexity that prevails in reality has been stretched a bit too far. More appropriate models are clusters, and collections of cluster have been suggested as the reactive sites on surfaces.20 In fact, size-selected unsupported neutral platinum clusters not only react with methane but also exhibit a remarkable size dependence in the dehydrogenation of CH4, and the analysis reveals that coordinative unsaturation is of crucial importance.21 A related behavior has also been observed for free charged Ptn+/− clusters (n=1–21) which, in addition to pronounced size effects, exhibit the following trends: 1) Cationic clusters, owing to their electrophilic character and to the mechanism of CH bond activation, are generally more reactive than their anionic counterparts, with the reactivity of a given neutral platinum cluster falling between those of the charged systems; 2) with increasing cluster size the reactivity drops.22 The anomalously low reactivity of Pt4+[22] has been traced back to the lack of a thermochemical driving force.23c In the room-temperature reactions of cationic heteronuclear MPt+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au) or of the homonuclear Rh2+ clusters, dehydrogenation of CH4 is also facile.5c,5d, 23
A notable cluster-size effect in the context of catalytic methane activation was reported by Bernhardt, Landman, and co-workers.24 While atomic ground-state Au+ (1S0) is entirely unreactive towards methane,25 isolated Au2+ clusters mediate CC coupling of methane at increased substrate pressure to yield ethane [Eq. (6)].
((6))
In this experimental and computational study, approximately 106 mass-selected Au2+ ions were confined to an ion trap (which acts, so to speak, as the gas-phase chemist’s test tube) for a few hundred microseconds in CH4/He mixtures at a pressure of about 1 Pa and a temperature that was varied between 200 and 300 K. These experimental conditions permit derivation of the catalytic cycle depicted in Scheme 2, which was completely characterized in terms of the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Several features are noteworthy. 1) Owing to the rather high pressure applied, reaction intermediates were collisionally stabilized and thus accessible; further, the temperature variation permitted the study of endothermic processes. 2) These findings illustrate an oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) at ambient temperature. 3) In the multicollision experiment, methane is not only involved as a reactant but also serves as a ligand to release C2H4 from the Au2+ catalyst. 4) Working at higher pressure removes the problem of the so-called “pressure gap” between the high vacuum and condensed phases, which often hampers model studies in their “relevance” for understanding real catalysis.3b, 26 As to some of the facets contained in Scheme 2, the first barrier ΔE1, surpassed only at temperatures above 250 K, is encountered in the sequence of CH bond activation, making an HH bond, and the elimination of H2. A second barrier (ΔE2) must be involved in the release of C2H4 from the intermediate Au2(C2H4)(CH4)+, because this intermediate is observed between 250 and 270 K, but not at 300 K. Finally, a third barrier (ΔE3) is associated with the cluster degradation. As stated in a Highlight article,27 these findings, in addition to their fundamental importance, are likely to be of practical importance in the design of catalysts.

Finally, it should be mentioned that coupling of methane to produce C2H4 has also been realized in a cluster-assisted σ-bond-activation reaction. Here, atomic Ti+, at elevated CH4 pressure, undergoes CH bond activation and oxidative coupling of the CHn (n=2, 3) fragments in Ti(CH4)m+ clusters (m≥4) at thermal energies.28, 29
3. Hydrogen-Atom Abstraction from Methane: The Very First Step in the Lunsford Mechanism of Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM)
Much of the research on the direct conversion of methane has been devoted to this reaction, which involves the catalytic conversion of methane and oxygen to ethane and water [Eq. (7)] at elevated temperature (above 650 °C).2d, 30
((7))
The fundamental aspects of the problem involve both a heterogeneous component, which includes the activation of CH4 on (usually doped) metal oxide surfaces, and a homogeneous gas-phase part; in the latter, coupling of the free methyl radicals and subsequent dehydrogenation (C2H6→C2H4) occurs. Much of the current debate31 centers around the nature of the active metal oxide surface species, which, according to Lunsford’s suggestion,30b, 32 corresponds to an oxygen-centered radical (Scheme 3). However, no controversy exists as to the rate-limiting step of OCM, and the consensus view assigns this role to the initial homolytic scission of the CH bond of methane.33

Perhaps the most compelling evidence for the role of oxygen-centered radicals in the hydrogen-atom abstraction step by metal oxides [Eq. (8)], as well as mechanistic insight into the elementary steps of the reaction with an emphasis on the detailed role of [M], have been provided by gas-phase studies of mass-selected, electronic ground-state metal oxide ions. These include not only the transition-metal-based oxides OsO4+.,9a FeO+.,34 MnO+.,35 MoO3+.,36 V4O10+.,37 TiO2+.,38 ZrO2+.,38 and their oligomeric clusters39 but also main-group-element oxides, for example, MgO+.,40 MO+. (M=Ca, Sr, Ba),41 PbO+.,42 non-metallic SO2+.,43 mixed metal/non-metal clusters PnV4−nO10+. (n=1, 2, 4),44 the bimetallic oxide AlVO4+.,45 as well as the oligomeric clusters (Al2O3)n+. (n=3–5).46 Common to all these systems are the following features: 1) A very efficient homolytic CH bond activation according to Equation (8) achieved at room temperature; this activation is a consequence of a favorable thermochemistry, as the hydrogen affinities of these element oxide species exceed the CH bond strength in methane, and 2) without exception, according to the theoretical studies, all element oxide radical ions exhibit high spin densities at a terminal oxygen atom.
((8))
The crucial role of an oxygen-centered radical is demonstrated by the following experimental observations and computational findings. 1) For the oligomeric clusters (Al2O3)n+. (n=3–5) only those clusters react spontaneously at room temperature according to Equation (8) that have an even number of aluminum atoms (Al6O9+., Al8O12+., and Al10O15+.); clusters that contain an odd number of aluminum atoms (Al7On+ (n=9, 10, 11) and Al9On+ (n=13, 14)) lack a radical center and do not exhibit any reactivity towards CH4.46 2) In contrast to the open-shell cluster Al3VO7+., whose spin is not located at a terminal oxygen atom, the related system AlVO4+. brings about efficient homolytic cleavage of the CH bond of CH4 at room temperature. DFT calculations indicate that the hydrogen-atom transfer is exclusively confined to the terminal AlO and not the VO unit, as it is the former group at which the spin is located (Figure 2).45a Similarly, in the mixed PnV4−nO10+. clusters (n=1, 2) or the heteronuclear vanadium silicon oxide radical cation clusters, the radical site is located at the terminal PO or SiO units.44b,44c, 45b 3) Finally, while H-atom abstraction from the closed-shell system CaO/CH4 is calculated to be slightly exothermic, the barrier of the process is insurmountably high;47 this behavior very much contrasts with that of the rather reactive CaO+./CH4 couple.41

As to the mechanism(s) of the hydrogen-atom abstraction from CH4, two conceivable scenarios have been identified, that is, a direct pathway (“harpoon” mechanism) and an indirect process in which the hydrogen delivery from the carbon atom to the oxygen atom is mediated by the metal atom. Convincing examples for both scenarios are known, with SO2+., AlVO4+., and PnV4−nO10+. (n=0, 1, 2, 4) belonging to the former and MgO+., PbO+., MnO+., FeO+., and MoO3+. to the latter. Both mechanistic variants will be presented below.
In the gas-phase reaction of the polynuclear oxide cluster V4O10+. with methane,48 no long-lived encounter complex V4O10+./CH4 seems to exist; rather, in a barrier-free process (Figure 3) the hydrogen atom is pulled away to produce, in a rather exothermic reaction, the intermediate [V4O9OH]+⋅⋅⋅CH3., from which the loosely bound CH3. is liberated.37

The evolution of this efficient process (60 % of the collision rate), which is associated with an intramolecular kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 1.35,37, 49 has been confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (Figure 4 and Figure 5). For the first 450 fs of the simulation, the potential energy decreases steadily, driven only by the small attractive forces between methane and the cluster ion, which is indicative of a barrier-free reaction. In parallel, the OH and VC distances decrease steadily, and the CH distance increases. After 450 fs, when the system has gained approximately 24.5 kcal mol−1 internal energy, energy is transferred into the CH and OH stretching modes, corresponding to oscillations of the hydrogen atom between the vanadyl oxygen atom and the methyl carbon atom. Further, the VC distance decreases until t=470 fs and then slowly increases again, thus indicating the beginning of the expulsion of the CH3 radical.

The fluctuations after 450 fs result from vibrational motions, mainly of the OH group (adapted from Ref. 37).
The progress of the reaction can also be seen by inspection of the calculated spin densities shown in Figure 5. In the initial-state structure (a), the spin density is similar to that of the isolated V4O10+. cluster and only insignificantly more delocalized. Structure (b) describes the situation after 443 fs; the OH and CH distances are nearly identical, and the spin density is distributed between the vanadyl oxygen atom and the carbon atom and is polarized along the O-H-C axis. Finally, in the product (c), the spin is completely transferred to the methyl radical.

Room-temperature activation of CH4 by diatomic MgO+. may serve as an example for a “metal-mediated” hydrogen abstraction; such homolytic bond cleavage is also a hallmark of the reactions of CH4 with PbO+., MnO+., FeO+., and MoO3+. As shown in Figure 6, the reaction commences with the generation of an encounter complex CH4⋅⋅⋅Mg2+⋅⋅⋅O−. in which the spin is almost exclusively located at the oxygen atom. Next, the methane molecule migrates around the magnesium atom toward the oxygen atom, delivery of a hydrogen atom occurs, and the newly formed methyl group is pulled back to the magnesium core. The thus formed H3C⋅⋅⋅Mg+OH intermediate represents a complex between a loosely bound methyl radical, which carries more than 98 % of the spin, and protonated magnesium oxide. From this intermediate, CH3. is liberated in an entropy-driven dissociation; formation of the thermochemically more favored product combination Mg+./CH3OH by a rebound mechanism is kinetically less attractive.40

Finally, in the context of homolytic CH bond cleavage reactions, a brief comment seems befitting about using kinetic isotope effects as an experimental probe to classify reaction mechanisms. As already mentioned, direct hydrogen abstraction from CH4 is characterized by rather small KIEs, whereas those homolytic CH bond cleavages which are mediated by the metal core exhibit larger KIEs, typically greater than 2.0. Moreover, as discussed by Schröder et al. in detail,50 for a given reaction type there exists a relationship between the size of the KIEs and the overall rate coefficients of the hydrogen-atom abstraction from methane. For example, the intermolecular KIE, derived from the reactions with CH4 and CD4, continuously increases from about 1.3 for MgO+. via 2.1 and 2.4 for CaO+. and SrO+., respectively, to 3.2 for BaO+..41 This trend of increasing KIEs is paralleled by a decrease of the overall rate coefficients for the activation of methane, for example, from 3.9×10−10 for MgO+. and 2.9×10−10 for CaO+. to 9.8×10−11 and 1.1×10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for SrO+. and BaO+., respectively.41, 50 With regard to catalysis, this observation implies that the less reactive oxidants exhibit higher selectivities in terms of the associated KIEs, apparently in line with the time-honored Bell–Evans–Polanyi principle.51
4. The Conversion of Methane to Methanol: A Long-Time Conundrum Resolved at Long Last by the Two-State Reactivity Concept
Dem Anwenden muss das Erkennen vorausgehen.
Max Planck, 191952
Planck’s comment on the decision to award the Nobel Prize for Chemistry (1918) to Fritz Haber, and repeated at the annual meeting of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft on October 29, 1919 in a different context, does not only serve to this very day as a precept of Germany’s Max-Planck-Gesellschaft but also summarizes Haber’s exceptional skill in bridging the gap in the natural sciences between theory and application. In Bernal’s words, Haber was “the greatest authority in the world on the relations between science and industry”.53
Perhaps the largest potential for a major advance in methane conversion technology is in the discovery of a direct route to the formation of methanol and formaldehyde at ambient conditions,2 and it is not unjustified to relate Sir Derek Barton’s famous dictum2a about “Holy Grails in Chemistry”54 to the oxygenation of CH bonds in alkanes, for example, the reaction in Equation (1), given the complexity of this deceptively trivial reaction, which looks easy only on paper.55, 56 In reality, there are quite a few challenges, as for example:
1)
the unbalanced stoichiometry: there is one oxygen atom too many in Equation (1);
2)
the overoxidation challenge: both intermediates CH3OH and CH2O are kinetically more prone to further oxidation than the starting molecule CH4 with its thermochemically strong and kinetically inert CH bond;
3)
the spin dilemma: since CH4 and CH3OH possess singlet ground states, the reaction is spin-forbidden when O2 is used as terminal oxidant.
1
Nature has solved these riddles in the evolutionary development of the methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzyme, which contains at the reaction center a structurally relatively simple, doubly oxygen-bridged diiron cluster.57 MMO has served chemists as an enticing example of what could possibly be achieved, and FePO4 is an interesting in vitro model for the production of CH3OH and CH2O when H2 is added to CH4 and O2.58 The two oxidation products are formed with selectivities of 23 and 45 %, respectively, but only at a disappointingly low methane conversion level of about 0.6 %. Similarly unsatisfying with regard to a large-scale, economically attractive, environmentally benign functionalization of CH4 were the mechanistically appealing experiments of Periana et al., which made use of bipyrimidyl-substituted platinum(II) complexes,2i, 59a in analogy to Shilov’s seminal studies employing platinum compounds dating back to the mid-20th century,60 or Au0-based oxidations of CH4 with H2SeO4.59b With regard to practical applications, however, experiments which employ platinum-based solid catalysts are more promising.59c,59d
A rewarding insight into the mechanisms—and thus the underlying obstacles encountered in the numerous, often frustrating solution-phase and surface-based experiments—has been derived in the last two decades from a happy marriage between sophisticated gas-phase experiments of mass-selected, electronic-ground-state metal oxide cations MO+ and computational studies. Only some of the more fundamental aspects from this rather extensive work61 will be addressed here. First, it should be mentioned in passing, without discussing this fascinating topic in any further detail, that the understanding of the simple gas-phase reaction, depicted in Equation (9a), has later proved helpful in the clarification and elucidation of the mechanisms of the intricate cytochrome P450 mediated hydroxylation of hydrocarbons as well as in providing a rationale for the competitive H-atom abstraction versus O-atom transfer of nonheme iron(IV) oxide oxidants.62
(9)
In the stoichiometric gas-phase model reactions of MO+ with CH4, three principal product channels are conceivable [Eq. (9)], and the experimentally determined rate coefficients and branching ratios are controlled by thermochemical and spin considerations; Reaction (9c) is usually reserved for oxides that contain 5d metals.7 In this Section, we will focus on features that are of particular relevance for the reaction shown in Equation (9a), in which the insertion intermediate H3CM+OH is key. Although the metal has the formal oxidation state MIII in both MO+ and H3CM+OH, there are fundamental differences in the bonding situations, which have important consequences. Thus, 3d and 4d metals cannot effectively support π-type double bonds in MO+, which consequently leads to high-spin ground states for the MO+ monocations. In contrast, the insertion intermediates primarily involve σ-type bonding, for which perfect pairing and thus low-spin ground states are preferred. Therefore, a situation results, in which the spin surfaces cross each other such that the reaction pathway of lowest energy demand must involve a crossover from the high-spin to the low-spin surface and eventually back to high spin in the final products. In fact, the analysis of the reactions of bare metal oxide cations in the gas phase led, among other things, to the development of the paradigm of two-state reactivity (TSR).17c,17d, 62, 63 The TSR scenario is now widely accepted in various areas of science far beyond gas-phase-ion chemistry, for example in organometallic chemistry64 and also in the context of metalloenzymes.62
The (simplified) potential-energy surface for the reaction of bare FeO+ with CH4 (Figure 7) may serve as an illustrative example. After having formed an encounter complex (CH4)FeO+, spin–orbit-mediated coupling brings about a switch from the high-spin sextet ground state to an excited quartet state;34e, 65 only in this spin state is formation of the insertion intermediate H3CFe+OH via TS1 thermochemically possible under ambient conditions, and it is the spin change that avoids the high-energy TS1 on the ground-state sextet surface.

Thus, as stated above, excited states are involved in a thermal reaction. As pointed out by Poli and Harvey,64a it is only because of a spin change that these reactions occur at all under ambient conditions. The essence of the idea of a TSR scenario is depicted in Figure 8, and it represents the key element of “spin catalysis”: a (thermal) reaction is accelerated by a spin change which, by avoiding energetically less attractive transition structures, opens up favorable pathways.

While the details of the PESs for CH bond oxygenation by MO+ depend very much on the nature of the transition metal M in MO+, excellent agreement has been arrived at for the thermal reactions of MO+ (M=Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) with CH4 when compared with computational studies.4a, 34a,34b, 35a,35b, 66 Several notable, general trends are as follows: First, the early 3d transition-metal oxides ScO+, TiO+, VO+, CrO+, and MnO+ have low-spin ground states. This characteristic alters the PESs such that the intersystem crossing does not occur in the vicinity of TS1 (Figure 7) but instead closer to TS2. As the ground states of the products are high-spin systems, only one spin flip is necessary. Next, the reactions of ScO+, TiO+, and VO+ with CH4 to produce CH3OH are endothermic owing to the enormous D0(M+O) values (greater than 135 kcal mol−1), which substantially exceed the oxygen-atom affinity of CH4 to produce CH3OH (90.7 kcal mol−1). Further, as the O-atom transfer from CrO+ is only slightly exothermic, none of these oxides bring about thermal activation of CH4.
For MnO+, the exothermicity of its reaction with methane already suffices to break the CH bond and to generate H3CMn+OH; next, this intermediate liberates a methyl radical in a spin-allowed, entropically favored process; the spin-forbidden rebound step, with subsequent CH3OH loss, is not competitive. The two late-transition-metal oxides CoO+ and NiO+, when treated with CH4, undergo spin inversion close to the entrance channel; an additional spin flip at the elimination of CH3OH is not required, because the ground state of the resulting metal ions is of the 3dn configuration. The experimentally observed significant differences in the reaction coefficients (more than a factor of 20 in favor of NiO+) in generating CH3OH from CH4 and MO+ (M=Co, Ni) are due to details of the PESs close to the insertion step as well as to different spin–orbit coupling factors. Finally, according to the calculations, CuO+ is predicted to be one of the most powerful hydrocarbon oxidants among all binary 3d metal oxide cations; however, as a consequence of its small bond-dissociation energy, D0(Cu+O)=37.4 kcal mol−1, to date all attempts to generate the reagent in the gas phase and to subject it to the stoichiometric or catalytic conversions of methane have failed. [See however the Addendum.]
The genuine gas-phase catalytic oxidation CH4→CH3OH by MO+ was realized quite some time ago for FeO+ 34a and, more recently, for NiO+ and PdO+.67 On the basis of computational and experimental studies, it was shown that NiO+, owing to its easy availability and high selectivity, is a rather promising candidate, and experiments that use NiO- or FeO-doped zeolites as catalyst for the oxygenation of CH4 under ambient conditions are also encouraged by computational and (for iron and copper) experimental investigations.68
5. On the Detailed Mechanisms of CH3OH→CH2O Oxidation
While most of the roughly 40 million metric tons of methanol processed annually are converted into a variety of diverse chemical products,2k the leading among them is formaldehyde, which is also one of the top 25 chemicals produced worldwide.2k, 69 Here, we focus on some mechanistic aspects of the conversion CH3OH→CH2O, and the relevant questions in this context center around the following topics: 1) In the initial step (Scheme 4) does a metal-based mediator [M] preferentially induce a cleavage of the stronger OH bond (102.4 kcal mol−1) or the weaker CH bond (91.7 kcal mol−1), and 2) for a given sequence of events, which of the two hydrogen-transfer steps constitutes the rate-determining one? These questions will be addressed first by describing reactions of methanol with neutral atoms under matrix-isolation conditions, on surfaces, or in the gas phase when treated with bare or ligated ions. Subsequently, examples of genuine gas-phase catalysis will be presented, and, finally, a brief comparison will be made between model systems and a real catalyst.

Pathways for a metal-mediated methanol–formaldehyde conversion.
5.1. The Initial Step: Cleavage of the Strong OH versus the Weaker CH Bond
In all matrix-isolation studies, often complemented by computational exercises, for the reactions of methanol with neutral atoms (M=Fe,70 Si,71 B,72 Be,73 Mg,73a Sc,74 Ti,75 or Mn70a) upon annealing or photochemical activation, the encounter complexes M(CH3OH) undergo, in a kinetically controlled fashion, specific activation of the stronger OH bond (path
Scheme 4) to produce the corresponding [M]OCH3 species.76 Similarly, the numerous experimental investigations, employing the whole arsenal of contemporary advanced surface-spectroscopy techniques, combined with elaborate computational studies of the reactions of methanol on supported metal oxides, demonstrate that the “methoxide pathway”
is preferred.77 These studies, which, among other things, also deal with the role of support effects, formal oxidation states of the metal oxides, and selectivity effects caused by the atomic structures of the surfaces, further reveal that in the sequence CH3OH→[M]OCH3→CH2O the second step, that is, the CH bond activation in the methoxy intermediate, constitutes the rate-limiting one.77 In a rather detailed computational investigation, the kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the CH3OH→CH2O conversion using titania-supported vanadates were addressed, and the following main conclusions were drawn:78
1)
Methoxy species are key intermediates in the reaction, with a tetrahedral vanadia unit containing a vanadyl group, a methoxy group, and two bridging V-O-Ti sites forming the most stable one. A fivefold-coordinated vanadia unit was found to be potentially interesting for catalytic reactivity.
2)
The rate-limiting step in the oxidation mechanisms corresponds to the transfer of a hydrogen atom from the [V]OCH3 intermediate to the catalyst oxygen site VO (barrier of 41.0 kcal mol−1) or to a bridging interface unit V-O-Ti (barrier 46.0 kcal mol−1). Both pathways involve spin crossings from the singlet to the triplet potential-energy surfaces, involving TSR scenarios.
However, and perhaps not entirely unexpectedly, a change in mechanism can occur when methanol oxidation is brought about by oxide-free surfaces. For example, in the oxidative CH3OH decomposition on Pt(111), according to periodic, self-consistent DFT calculations, the rate-limiting step is now assigned to initial OH bond activation to produce a methoxy-bound intermediate.79 Other computational work80 arrived at the conclusion that CH bond scission contributes to the first and rate-limiting step in the Pt(111) decomposition of CH3OH; while this process is favored by 12 kcal mol−1 as compared with an initial OH bond activation (Figure 9),80a neither decomposition route for methanol can compete with the desorption of the intact substrate from the surface.

A change in mechanism has also been noted in the electrochemical decomposition of CH3OH on platinum surfaces; a KIE of 3 for the system CH3OH/CD3OH and its absence for the CH3OH/CH3OD couple, together with other data, were interpreted in favor of the “hydroxymethyl pathway” (
in Scheme 4).80, 81 Finally, initial CH rather than OH bond cleavage is computationally predicted to be favored in methanol activation on sub-nanometer Pd clusters.82
Numerous gas-phase experiments with both cationic and anionic reagents, bare or ligated atoms, and clusters of different sizes and varying stoichiometries have been conducted over the last three decades and aimed at revealing the mechanisms of CH3OH→CH2O conversion at a strictly molecular level. While highly remarkable cluster-size effects,83g–83k,83n,83q the role of formal oxidation states,83q or anomalously large kinetic isotope effects have been observed,83e most of these studies83 did not provide a clear-cut mechanistic distinction between initial OH versus CH bond scission (Scheme 4). Preferred OH bond activation, however, is suggested for the system FeO+/CH3OH according to experimental data84a and supported by DFT calculations.84b Similarly, mass-selected cations FeX+ (X=OH, F) undergo a clean reaction with CD3OH [Eq. (10)],85a while the related NiX+ systems (X=OH, F, Cl, Br) effect both OH and CD bond activation of CD3OH; the branching ratio is strongly ligand-dependent.85b For example, Ni(OH)+ prefers OH bond activation, but the complex NiBr+ preferentially activates the CD bond of CD3OH.85b Finally, in the initial phase of the reaction of VO3− with methanol, extensive labeling experiments and computational studies indicate that specific activation of the OH group prevails as well.86
((10))
Unambiguous examples for an initial CH bond activation are rather scarce; for example, the gas-phase reaction between Mn(CO)3− and methanol commences with the rate-limiting CH bond cleavage of the substrate,86a and in the reaction of Con+ (n=4, 5) cluster ions with CD3OH, only D2 is liberated.86b For the oxidation of methanol by ferrate (FeO42−), numerous pathways were considered computationally, and it appears that CH and OH bond scissions compete with each other.87 This prediction, including computed KIEs to distinguish between different mechanistic scenarios, calls for an experimental verification. For the dehydrogenation of CH3OH by mononuclear vanadium oxide cations, in line with the experimental findings, calculations clearly favor a reaction path that is initiated by activation of a CH bond in the course of which the metal’s oxidation state does not change (Scheme 5); moreover, spin changes from the ground-state triplet surface to the excited singlet manifold do not matter in this particular system, as the two electronic ground states are well-separated energetically and do not cross.88

The mechanisms of the CH3OH→CH2O oxidation by the Fenton reagent were studied by Baerends and co-workers at the DFT level89 both in the gas phase by considering microsolvated clusters and in aqueous solutions. Two competing mechanisms were identified, in line with the dual nature of the reagent: 1) A direct one in which the high-valent FeIVO2+ moiety homolytically abstracts a hydrogen atom from the methyl group (path
in Scheme 4) and 2) a coordination mechanism in which after complexation the OH bond of the substrate is cleaved heterolytically to generate initially an Fe(OCH3) species (path
in Scheme 4). As expected, given the nature of highly charged systems, solvent effects matter, with the consequence that the energy barriers calculated are quite sensitive to changes of the microenvironment.89
A strongly metal-dependent, alternating activation of CH versus OH bonds of methanol occurs when the gas-phase species are generated upon electrospray ionization of methanolic solutions of MX2 (M=Fe, Co, Ni; X=Br, I).90–92 As shown in Figure 10, in the iron system selective activation of the hydroxy group of the ESI solvent prevails; in contrast, nickel salts activate the CH bond, and for the cobalt complexes an intermediate situation is encountered.90a

Combining the labeling data (Figure 10) with structure-specific collision experiments of the [M,C,H3,O]+ product ions provides evidence for the exclusive formation of Fe(OCH3)+, Ni(CH2OH)+, and a mixture of Co(OCH3)+ and Co(CH2OH)+ with a preference for the methoxy complex.90a Interestingly, a mixture of Rh(OCH3) and Rh(CH2OH), with comparable RhO and RhC bond dissociation energies, has also been obtained from treating rhodium(I) porphyrines with methanol.90b
Mechanistic insight into the origin of the bond-selective, metal-dependent CH3OH activation has been gathered from extensive DFT calculations and by experimentally establishing the precursors from which the [M,C,H3,O]+ species originate upon ESI of MX2/CH3OH solutions.90a, 92 For iron, the Fe(OCH3)+ product is due to sequential evaporation of up to eight CH3OH molecules from Fe(OCH3)(CH3OH)n+ (n≤8), and the latter is generated by solvolysis of FeX2 by the nucleophilic CH3OH solvent. Moreover, high-spin Fe(OCH3)+ is, according to DFT calculations, 16.6 kcal mol−1 more stable than the quintet isomer Fe(CH2OH)+. For the co-generation of isomeric [Co,C,H3,O]+, two pathways have been identified. One, leading to the methoxy complex Co(OCH3)+, is analogous to that for the iron system starting from Co(OCH3)(CH3OH)n+ (n≤8). However, this precursor, in competition with sequential CH3OH evaporation, also undergoes loss of CH2O and CH3OH to generate Co(H)(CH3OH)+. This intermediate, in a spin-allowed elimination involving the CoH bond and a hydrogen atom from the methyl group of CH3OH, then decomposes to a quartet state of Co(CH2OH)+ which is 6.0 kcal mol−1 higher in energy than ground-state Co(OCH3)+ having the same multiplicity. For the exclusive generation of Ni(CH2OH)+ two pathways were identified, both involving Ni(X)(CH3OH)+ (X=H, Br) as immediate precursors; in the subsequent evaporation of HX, the hydrogen atom originates from the methyl group of CH3OH. DFT calculations (Figure 11) are not only consistent with the experimental observations but also explain why Ni(CH2OH)+ is formed rather than the thermochemically slightly more favorable Ni(OCH3)+ isomer. Here, the crucial point is that starting from ground-state triplet Ni(H)(CH3OH)+ (36), the spin-allowed reaction to produce 3Ni(OCH3)+ via 3TS6/7 cannot compete energetically with a reaction which, after spin inversion 36→16, proceeds via 1TS6/8 toward 1Ni(CH2OH)+.92

Both structures 7 and 37a correspond to Ni(OCH3)(H2)+ complexes, with the HH bond parallel and perpendicular to the NiOC plane, respectively; no bond activation is involved in 3TS7/7a. 3TS8a/8 corresponds to a haptotropic metal shift from the oxygen atom to the carbon atom of the CH2OH ligand. Relative energies are given in kcal mol−1 (adapted from Ref. 92).
Finally, the celebrated Ni(H)(OH)+ species93 in the reaction with CD3OH undergoes exclusive loss of HD, thus pointing to a clean activation of the methyl CD bond.85b
5.2. Genuine Catalytic Cycles in the Gas-Phase Oxidation of Methanol
A conceptually rather attractive scheme for the Fe+-catalyzed oxidation of methane that involves the conversion of CH4 into CH2O by O2 in the presence of CH3OH as a co-catalyst will be discussed first.55, 94 Oxygen-atom transport may proceed both in the formation of CH2O from CH3OH with O2 as the O-atom donor for atomic Fe+ and in the oxidation CH4→CH3OH with FeO+ [Eq. (11)–(13)], .

((13))
The key gas-phase experiments that mimic the overall Reaction (13) are summarized in Equations (14)–(17), , , . The 〈O〉 equivalent of the reaction shown in Equation (11) is provided by FeO+. Since FeO+ cannot be generated directly from the Fe+/O2 couple on thermochemical grounds,95 the decisive experiment is a methanol-mediated activation of dioxygen in which the alcohol serves as a co-reductant [Eq. (16)]. While this process is quite exothermic (ΔrH=−24 kcal mol−1), the rate efficiency is only about 10 % as a result of spin barriers.84, 85, 96
((14))
((15))
((16))
((17))
A combination of the steps in Equations (14)–(17) leads to a viable sequence for the Fe+-mediated oxidation of CH4 to generate CH2O according to Equation (13). Here, the CH3OH molecule coordinated to the metal plays a central role both as a precursor for the oxidation product CH2O and as a crucial intermediate in the activation of O2. Furthermore, the co-formation of FeO+ in Reaction (16) is quite remarkable in that over-oxidation (namely, the formation of Fe+ and HCOOH) does not occur in this experiment, although bare FeO+ rapidly reacts with formaldehyde.97 The seemingly most simple step in Scheme 6, that is, the mere complexation of the iron cation by methanol [Eq. (17)], however, does not take place in the low-pressure regime (typically below 10−7 mbar). However, the magnitude of k17 can be enhanced with increasing pressure through ternary collisions.

A completely different, rather interesting example has been reported by O’Hair and co-workers, who studied computationally and experimentally the reaction of VO3− with CH3OH in the gas phase, including the re-oxidation of the catalyst.98 The first step of the reaction corresponds to the addition of methanol so that the methoxy group coordinates directly to the vanadium atom and the hydrogen atom of the OH group interacts with one of the oxygen atoms of VO3− (Scheme 7). In the second step, another hydrogen atom from the methyl group migrates to the newly formed hydroxy group, which leads to a complex of VO2−, water, and formaldehyde. This complex loses preferentially H2O. Formaldehyde is subsequently replaced by molecular oxygen, and this step represents the reoxidation of VIII back to the VV catalyst. The subsequent coordination of another methanol molecule proceeds in analogy with the first step, but the oxidation of the methoxy group to formaldehyde this time is not associated with the formation of a water molecule but with the reduction of the η2-peroxy ligand. Elimination of the thus formed formaldehyde and subsequent water loss leads to the regeneration of the VO3− catalyst.

For the binuclear anionic dimolybdate clusters shown in Scheme 8, two gas-phase cycles have been identified, and in both cycles Mo2(O6)(OCHR2)− (R=H, alkyl) acts as a central intermediate.99 Three steps matter: 1) condensation of [Mo2O6(OH)]− with the alcohols R2CHOH and elimination of water to produce an alkoxo-bound cluster; 2) oxidation of the alkoxo ligand and its liberation as an aldehyde or a ketone in a step which is rate-limiting and requires the supply of external energy through collisional activation; 3) regeneration of the catalyst by oxidation with nitromethane. The second cycle is similar, but differs in the order of the reaction with the alcohol and the use of nitromethane as the terminal oxidant.

links Mo2O6(OCH3)− and Mo2O5(OH)− and appears in both cycles, which differ in the sequence of the reactions with CH3NO2 and CH3OH (adapted from Ref. 99).
The role of the binuclear metal center was assessed by examination of the relative reactivities of the mononuclear MO3(OH)− and binuclear M2O6(OH)− complexes (M=Cr, Mo, W). The molybdenum and tungsten binuclear centers (M=Mo, W) were reactive towards alcohols, but the chromium complex was not; this finding is consistent with the order of basicity of the hydroxo ligand in these anionic complexes. However, the tungsten complex W2O6(OCHR2)− prefers a redox-neutral elimination of an alkene rather than oxidation of the alkoxo ligand to form an aldehyde or a ketone. This observation is in keeping with the oxidizing power of the anions. Interestingly, each of the mononuclear anions MO3(OH)− (M=Cr, Mo, W) was inert to reaction with methanol, which highlights the importance of the second MO3 unit in the catalytic cycles. Clearly, only the bimolybdate center has the appropriate balance of electronic properties that allows it to participate in each of the three steps; these gas-phase studies with well-defined cluster anions correspond to the unique role of molybdenum(VI) trioxide (MoO3) in the industrial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde at 300–400 °C.100
Finally, the dinuclear manganese oxide cations Mn2O2+ and Mn2O+ were also found to act as catalysts in the gas-phase oxidation of CH3OH.101 As in the previous system, input of external energy (collisional activation or heating) is, however, essential for at least one of the reaction steps to close the catalytic cycle for the Mn2On+ (n=1, 2) oxides.
5.3. Comparison of a Model System with a Real Catalyst
While most of the gas-phase experiments rely on charged systems and therefore are somewhat limited in scope, in an in silico experiment, that is, computations, the intermediates and transition states assumed to be involved in a catalytic cycle do not suffer from this limitation; in addition, the structural complexity of the species can be modified at will and adjusted to both the gas-phase models and the real catalyst. Here, we will describe some aspects of the CH3OH→CH2O conversion for which silica-supported vanadium oxides serve as real catalysts. This reaction has also been studied in the gas phase in quite some detail using VO(OCH3)3+ and larger vanadium oxide clusters as models,83r, 88, 102 and extensive computational work also exists.77h, 103 The computed reaction sequence commences with adsorption of the substrate on the surface, the latter having a presumed vanadyl-site structure VO(OSi)3 (Figure 12). This step is associated with the cleavage of one of the VOSi bridges and provides VO(OCH3)(OSi)2 and HOSi sites. Next, a hydrogen atom from the methoxy group is transferred to the terminal vanadyl oxygen atom, which results in the formation of formaldehyde. The model compound VO(OCH3)3 thus mimics an intermediate in which two methoxy groups represent the missing OSi links to the silica support, while the remaining part is realistic. In the singly charged state, the model corresponds to the VV oxidation state with a radical site located at the oxygen atom of the VO unit; rearrangement leads to the VIV radical species coordinated to formaldehyde (Figure 12). The overall reaction within this distonic radical cation is exothermic. The energy barrier predicted at the B3LYP level (ca. 19 kcal mol−1) is slightly overestimated, as revealed by a comparison with the threshold photoionization study of the dissociation of VO(OCH3)3+; the latter suggests a barrier of about (13±2) kcal mol−1. The same model reaction in the neutral state shows similar results as far as the geometry and the formal oxidation states of the vanadium sites of intermediates and products are concerned; however, the corresponding reaction step is endothermic, as are experiments with real catalysts. Thus, in this case, while the charged model provides hints as to the reaction mechanism and suggests possible structures of intermediates, it cannot be taken as a reliable guide for energetic considerations.103a

Different models for a vanadyl site of a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst for the CH3OH→CH2O conversion, as calculated using B3LYP/TZVP; relative energies are given in kcal mol−1 (adapted from Refs. 4n, 103b).
As a further test for the relevance of such simplified models, a comparison of VO(OCH3)3 with larger model compounds, such as the dimer of VO(OCH3)3, VO[OSi(OH)3]3, or vanadyl silsesquioxane (Figure 12) has been made. The dimer of VO(OCH3)3 exhibits a reactivity that is qualitatively analogous with that of the monomer. The next two models, VO[OSi(OH)3]3 and silsesquioxane, offer the possibility to study the first reaction step, that is, the adsorption of methanol on the catalyst. This step leads, in the case of the VO[OSi(OH)3]3, to free Si(OH)4, which is stabilized by the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds.104 As this option is not available in a real catalyst, this model overestimates the adsorption energy (21 kcal mol−1). In the case of the vanadyl silsesquioxane complex, the addition of methanol to the model catalyst is accompanied by the formation of an integrated OSi(H)(OH)O unit, and therefore, the results can be expected to be more accurate. Accordingly, the adsorption energy drops substantially to 9.6 kcal mol−1. Next, hydrogen rearrangement within the OVO(OCH3)O unit occurs, and the activation energy for this step is calculated to be around 48 kcal mol−1 for the VO[OSi(OH)3]3 model and 48.5 kcal mol−1 for silsesquioxane. Final optimization using the broken-symmetry approach, correction for the spin contamination, and the inclusion of zero-point vibrational energy lowers the energy barrier to 37 kcal mol−1 (Figure 12). This value is in rather good agreement with the experiments conducted with real systems; therefore, the model approach appears adequate.103a, 104
Other examples for using gas-phase experiments with “isolated” reagents as models for mimicking reactions in the condensed phase include 1) the Degussa process, that is, the platinum-mediated coupling of methane and ammonia to generate HCN,5 2) the mechanistic understanding of the Cytochrome P450 mediated CH bond oxygenation62, 63 based on a detailed analysis of the most simple system, that is, FeO+/H2,63, 96 or 3) the relationship between the rich gas-phase chemistry of bare PtO2+[105] and the extraordinary features exhibited by high-valent platinum oxides,106 just to mention a few.
6. Conclusions
It remains a source of frustration to know so much about the reactions of transition-metal ions with hydrocarbons and yet have so many questions remain unanswered.
Peter B. Armentrout, Jack L. Beauchamp, 1989107
On this rather depressing note, Armentrout and Beauchamp concluded their superb review on the fundamental aspects of gas-phase organometallic chemistry. Considering the difficulties encountered at that time in elucidating mechanistic aspects of reactions occurring at a single metal center, it was not surprising that processes of higher complexity involving clusters, surface reactions, and metal catalysts were considered as “largely shrouded in mystery”.107 However, things have changed since the landmark paper of Allison, Freas, and Ridge in 1979108a about the first example of gas-phase activation of alkanes by “naked” transition-metal ions, the seminal Kappes–Staley report108b on genuine, homogeneous gas-phase catalysis by bare Fe+, and the Armentrout–Beauchamp review in 1989107—and, fortunately, things have changed for the better! This is in no small part due to the breath-taking instrumental improvements (laser desorption, electrospray ionization, Smalley-type cluster-ion sources, multipole analyzer, ion traps, gas-phase ion spectroscopy, ion-mobility experiments, or ion-electron diffraction, to name but a few) which permit experiments which were thought of as simply impossible two decades ago. Structures of gaseous, medium-sized species of any charge state can now be routinely identified spectroscopically and thus form a reliable starting point for reactivity studies.109 Conceptually, the development of new mechanistic paradigms, such as two-state reactivity17 or appreciating the role of relativistic effects12–14 in bond-activation processes, has removed some of the mysteries and are now considered relevant in several areas far beyond the field of gas-phase organometallic chemistry.62, 64 Further, the inclusion of ligated systems4j,4m,4n, 110 not only extends beyond the world of “idealized” naked-atom chemistry; these systems also serve as more realistic models for reactive species or intermediates that are capable of activating methane in the condensed phase, as do the exciting cluster studies aimed at mimicking surface reactions.4a,4g,4k,4l,4n, 22, 24, 48b,48c, 83, 111 A major breakthrough certainly was driven by computational chemistry. While open-shell, electronically and coordinatively unsaturated transition-metal systems still pose non-trivial problems,112 the progress made in the last two decades is nearly unparalleled—and that applies not only to gas-phase studies113 but extends also to the most complex surface reactions.31a, 114 Actually, the quality of contemporary computational studies is such that theoretical work no longer only complements or explains experimental findings after the fact; rather, theory occasionally challenges experimentalists by predicting the fleeting existence of particularly reactive species which have not yet been generated.115
There is indeed good reason to argue that an integrated approach, as intended and already realized to some extent by UniCat,116 will also help to cope with the persisting challenges associated with the activation of small molecules, for example, methane or carbon dioxide.117 Thus, at long last, bridging the gap between chemistry conducted at an atomic level in the gas phase and the most complex behavior at surfaces118 or in solution119 seems possible, provided scientists do not ignore Gerhard Ertl’s gentle reminder about the relationship between the simple and the complex, as depicted in Figure 13.120

7. Addendum
Since the submission of this review article, numerous publications have appeared which have a bearing on the topics discussed here. Among these studies, together with a few articles which were not included originally, the following ones deserve brief mentioning.
An exhaustive review on the role of organometallic intermediates on the active centers in surface-mediated CH bond activation has been published by Coperét,121 and the state-of-the-art of theoretical descriptions of surface reactions, aimed at engineering the electronic structure of the active surface sites, forms the focus of a review by Norskøv et al.122
With regard to the dehydrogenation of methane (Scheme 1, process
) by singly or doubly charged actinide ions (An+ or An2+), the role of 5f electrons and orbitals has been analyzed both computationally and experimentally.123 Of particular importance is the finalizing that the insertion efficiency to produce CAn2+H or CAn+H species is related to the energy needed to promote the An+/An2+ ions from their ground state to a prepared divalent state with two non-5f-valence electrons.124 In addition, in the exothermic reaction of, for example, Th2+ with CH4, a spin crossing from the ground-state triplet reactant to the excited singlet surface of the products is necessary to bring about thermal dehydrogenation. Possible origins of the anomalously low reactivity of Pt4+ towards CH422,23d has been discussed at great length using DFT-based calculations.125
In the context of homolytic CH bond cleavage [Eq. (8)], quite a few studies have been performed recently. In addition to the hydrogen-atom abstraction from CH4 by PbO+.,42 the congeners GeO+. and SnO+. exhibit parallel behavior both in terms of efficiencies and kinetic isotope effects.126 Extremely insightful experimental and computational studies on this topic were conducted by He, Ding, and co-workers.127 This work once more underlines the crucial role that oxygen-centered radicals play in the hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT), irrespective of the charge state; in fact, the calculated spin density at the terminal oxygen atoms in cluster oxides could be correlated with the observed rate constants, and evidence was presented how, by a proper choice of the chemical composition of the cluster oxides, a fine tuning of the spin density can be achieved.127b These findings, together with those described in Section 3, are of quite some importance in the conceptual understanding of HAT in solution. Here it has been suggested128 that “the presence of unpaired spin density at the abstracting atom is not a requirement for, or a predicator of, HAT reactivity”,128a and that HAT is better described by a coupled electron/proton transfer, that is, H.≅e-+H+. In the latter, the electron is transferred to the highly electrophilic metal (often in a high oxidation state), and the proton to the basic (oxygen) ligand. As far as gas-phase reactions are concerned, without any exception, thermal HAT requires the presence of unpaired spin density at the abstracting oxygen atom. This view is also supported by the recently described CuO+./CH4 couple.129 Here, the ground-state triplet of CuO+. with a spin density of 1.68 at the oxygen atom brings about, at room temperature, HAT with an efficiency of 20 % and an intramolecular KIE of 2.6. The competing CH4→CH3OH conversion, having an efficiency of 31 %, occurs after a triplet–singlet switch, that is, the CuO+./CH4 system demonstrates spin-selective reactions in the thermal activation of methane.
For the CH4→CH3OH conversion, several new articles addressing different aspects of this problem have also surfaced recently. Gunnoe and co-workers describe in a minireview strategies and fundamental advancements,130 the identification of reactive intermediates by matrix-isolation infrared spectroscopy has been reviewed by Wang and Zhou,131 theoretical aspects of the cytochrome P450 mediated methane oxidation form the subject of articles by Hu et al.132a and the Shaik group,132b tuning a P450 enzyme by protein engineering has been reported by Reetz and co-workers,133 and, finally, the role of Fe-doped zeolites68 in the oxidation of CH4 by N2O was reported as early as 1998.134
For the mechanism of the CH3OH→CH2O oxidation (Section 5), the work of Mavrikakis and co-workers135 is worth mentioning; the authors present a microkinetic model together with detailed experimental studies on the platinum-mediated decomposition of CH3OH and demonstrate that the reaction commences with scission of the CH bond, according to Scheme 4, path
; this step is also rate-limiting. For iron–vanadate catalysts, often employed for this reaction, in recent studies the nature of the catalytically active site has been identified, and it was shown that OH bond activation (Scheme 4, path
) initiates the methanol oxidation.136, 137
