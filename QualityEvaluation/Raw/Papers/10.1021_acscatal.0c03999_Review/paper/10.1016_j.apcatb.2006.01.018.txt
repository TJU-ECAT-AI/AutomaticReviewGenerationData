Abstract
The solvothermal reaction of mixtures of aluminum isopropoxide (AIP) and gallium acetylacetonate (Ga(acac)3) directly yielded the mixed
oxides of g-Ga2O3-Al2O3. In the solvothermal synthesis, the crystal structure of mixed oxides was controlled by the initial formation of g-Ga2O3
nuclei. The mixed oxides prepared in diethylenetriamine have extremely high activities for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with methane
as a reducing agent. With increasing crystallite size of the spinel structure, the catalytic activity increased. The ratio of the amount of methane
consumed by combustion to total methane conversion was proportional to the density of acid sites on the surface of the mixed oxides. The mixed
oxide catalysts prepared in diethylenetriamine had lower densities of acid sites and showed a higher methane-efﬁciency for CH4-SCR than those
prepared in other solvents. These catalysts maintained their high activity even when the reaction was carried out under the severe conditions (i.e.,
high space velocity and low NO concentration).

1. Introduction
Nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gases of stationary combustion
sources, such as power stations are now removed by selective
catalytic reduction (SCR) on V2O5/TiO2-based catalysts with
ammonia as the reducing agent [1]. However, because of the
toxicity and expensiveness of ammonia, safer, and less expensive
reducing agents, such as hydrocarbons have been sought.
Methane is one of the candidates [2–4], because it is a main
component of natural gas, an abundant resource, and in many
cases a fuel for thepower stations. Moreover, excess methane can
easily be removed by catalytic combustion, even if methane is
leaked from the SCR device.
Hydrothermal methods have been widely studied for the
synthesis of inorganic materials. We have been exploring the use
of organic media in place of water for the hydrothermal method
and found that various crystalline materials, such as a-Al2O3 can
be obtained in glycols (glycothermal method): a-Al2O3 was
crystallized via the glycothermal reaction at a temperature lower
than that required for the hydrothermal method [5–7]. The
products prepared by the glycothermal method are composed of
ultraﬁne particleshavinghighspeciﬁc surfaceareas,andtheycan
therefore be expected to be effective catalyst materials.
The Ga2O3/Al2O3-catalyzed selective catalytic reduction of
NO using methane as a reducing agent was reported by Shimizu
et al. [8,9]. We found that the glycothermal reaction of mixtures
of aluminum isopropoxide (AIP) and gallium acetylacetonate
(Ga(acac)3) directly yields the g-type Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed
oxides. These mixed oxides possess large surface areas and
higher activities for SCR of NO with methane than the catalysts
prepared by conventional methods [10]. Since the glycothermal
reaction of AIP alone yields the glycol derivative of boehmite
(GDB) [11], higher feed ratios of Al/(Ga + Al) result in a
contamination of the products with GDB, and the actual Al/
(Ga + Al) ratio in the mixed oxide is lower than that in the feed.
In the present work, therefore, the synthesis of g-Ga2O3-Al2O3
mixed oxides using various organic media was examined, and
the catalytic activities of the products for methane SCR of NO
were explored.

2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The g-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions were prepared by the
solvothermal method. A mixture of aluminum isopropoxide
and gallium acetylacetonate was suspended in 80 ml of a
solvent in a test tube, and the test tube was placed in a 200 ml
autoclave. An additional 30 ml of the reaction medium was
placed in the gap between the autoclave wall and the test tube.
After the autoclave was completely purged with nitrogen, the
reaction mixture was heated to 300 8C at a rate of 2.5 8C/min,
kept at that temperature for 2 h, and then cooled down to room
temperature. The product was repeatedly washed with acetone
by vigorous mixing and centrifuging, and then air-dried.
2.2. Selective catalytic reduction of NO with methane
Catalyst tests for the SCR of NO with methane were carried
out in a ﬁxed-bed ﬂow reactor. The solid solution in powder form
was calcined at 700 8C, tabletted, pulverized into 10–22 mesh,
and placed into the reactor. Thecatalystbedwas heatedto 600 8C
in a helium gas ﬂow and held at that temperature for 30 min.
Then, the reaction gas composed of 1000 ppm NO, 1000–
2000 ppm methane, 6.7% O2, 0–2.5% H2O, and helium as a
balance was introduced to the catalyst bed at W/F = 0.3 g s ml1
(SV  11,000 h1), and the efﬂuent gases from the reactor were
analyzed every 5 min in an on-line micro-gas-chromatograph
(columns: molecular sieve 5A at 80 8C; porapack Q at 40 8C).
Although the activity and selectivity were scarcely varied, data
obtained after keeping the catalyst bed at a temperature for
15 minwereadoptedinthispaper. Then,the bedtemperaturewas
decreased at a rate of 5 8C/min, and catalyst performance was
measured every 50 8C at the temperature range of 600–400 8C.
2.3. Characterization of catalysts
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a
Shimadzu XD-D1 diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation and a
carbon-monochromator. The crystallite size was calculated
from the half-height width of the (4 4 0) diffraction peak of the
g-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions using the Scherrer equation.
The speciﬁc surface areas of the samples were calculated by the
BET single-point method on the basis of the nitrogen uptake
measured at 77 K using a Micromeritics Flowsorb II 2300
sorptograph. The samples were evacuated at 300 8C for 30 min
prior to the measurement. Temperature-programmed desorp-
tion proﬁles of NH3 were obtained on a Bel Japan TPD-1-AT
apparatus with a Q-Mass detector.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Solvothermal synthesis of the Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed
oxides
The reaction of AIP alone in 2-(methylamino)ethanol
yielded g-Al2O3 with the crystal structure identical to that of
g-Ga2O3 obtained by the reaction of Ga(acac)3 alone.
Therefore, the g-Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxide without contam-
ination of byproducts was directly obtained even with an
extremely high Al/(Ga + Al) feed ratio. This is in sharp contrast
to the glycothermal reaction, in which the reaction of AIP alone
yielded the glycol derivative of boehmite; as a result, a high
feed ratio Al/(Ga + Al) resulted in contamination of the product
with the glycol derivative of boehmite [10].
Fig. 1 shows the relationship between the feed ratio Al/
(Ga + Al)andthe 4 4 0 spacingofthemixed oxide synthesizedin
1,5-pentanediol
(1,5-PeG)
and
2-(methylamino)ethanol.
Whereas the plots for the glycothermal products had an apparent
inﬂection at Al/(Ga + Al) = 0.778 because of the formation of
the glycol derivative of boehmite, the plots for the products
obtained in 2-(methylamino)ethanol gave a straight line over the
entire range of the Al/(Ga + Al) ratio in the feed. The broken line
in Fig. 1 represents the ideal 4 4 0 spacing of the Ga2O3-Al2O3
binary oxides linking between the 4 4 0 spacings of g-Ga2O3 and
g-Al2O3 (data from JCPDS cards No. 20–426 and 10–425,
respectively). The 4 4 0 spacing of the Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed
oxides obtained by the glycothermal method was slightly lower
than those expected from the Al/(Ga + Al) feed ratios, indicating
that the actual Al/(Ga + Al) ratios of the synthesized mixed
oxides was lower than that of the feed Al/(Ga + Al) ratios. On the
other hand, the 4 4 0 spacing of the Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides
prepared in 2-(methylamino)ethanol was identical with that
expected from the feed Al(Ga + Al) ratios. These results clearly
indicate that the solvothermal reaction in 2-(methylamino)etha-
nol directly yields the g-Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides with the Al/
(Ga + Al) ratios used in the feed.
The reaction of AIP alone in toluene at 315 8C for 2 h
yielded x-Al2O3, [12,13], and the reaction at 300 8C for 2 h
gave an amorphous product, while the reaction of Ga(acac)3
alone afforded g-Ga2O3. However, the reaction of mixtures of
Ga(acac)3 and AIP in toluene at both 315 and 300 8C for 2 h
yielded Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides with the g-type crystal

structure, irrespective of the reaction temperature. These results
can be explained by the initial formation of g-Ga2O3 nuclei,
which control the crystal structure of the mixed oxide, if
toluene is used as the reaction medium.
Although in some organic solvents (i.e., diethanolamine,
triethanolamine, and diethylenetriamine) amorphous products
were obtained in the reaction of AIP alone, a g-Ga2O3-Al2O3
mixed oxide (Al/(Ga + Al) = 0.70) was obtained in these
solvents (Fig. 2). These results indicate that, in the solvothermal
synthesis, the crystal structure of the mixed oxide is controlled
by the g-Ga2O3 nuclei. Therefore, we concluded that the
reaction media which lead to g-Ga2O3 in the reaction of
Ga(acac)3 alone, give g-Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides in the
reaction of mixtures of Ga(acac)3 and AIP.
3.2. Some properties of the mixed oxides
The crystal structures and physical properties of the products
obtained in various solvents are summarized in Table 1. The g-
Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides prepared in 2-(methylamino)etha-
nol had large surface areas and small crystallite sizes. On the
other hand, diethylenetriamine gave mixed oxides with small
surface areas and large crystallite sizes. The particle size
calculated from the surface area assuming that each primary
particle is spherical and that the true density of the mixed oxide
can be estimated from those of g-Ga2O3 and g-Al2O3 was
approximately identical with the crystallite size calculated from
the XRD using the Scherrer equation, suggesting that each
primary particle is a single crystal of the mixed oxide, and that
the primary particles are well dispersed. The crystallite size of
the g-Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides depends on the reaction
medium used for the solvothermal synthesis; however, no
correlation between the physical properties of the reaction
medium and the crystallite size of the product could so far be
found.
3.3. DeNOx reaction under dry conditions
Fig. 3 shows the results for SCR of NO with methane at
550 8C on the Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides synthesized in
various reaction media. With increasing Al/(Ga + Al) ratio in
the feed up to ca. 0.75, the NO conversion to N2 increases,
regardless of the reaction medium used for the synthesis of the
catalysts. We have already reported that tetrahedral Ga3+ ions
with Al3+ ions as next nearest neighbor sites are the active
centers for this reaction [9,10] and that Ga3+ ions preferentially
occupy the tetrahedral sites of the defect spinel structure of the
g-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution [10]. With increasing Al/
(Ga + Al) ratio, octahedral Ga3+ ions in the g-Ga2O3 structure
are progressively substituted by Al3+ ions, and therefore, the

number of active sites increases, thus increasing the catalyst
activity.
When the Al/(Ga + Al) ratio was further increased, the
catalytic activity abruptly decreased. As shown in Fig. 1, the
product obtained by using the glycol was contaminated with
GDB and boehmite. Therefore, in the previous paper [10], we
concluded that the decrease in the activity was due to the
decrease in the actual Al content of the mixed oxide. However,
for the Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides prepared in 2-(methyla-
mino)ethanol, the Al content in the mixed oxides mono-
tonously increased. Nonetheless, the activity decreased in the
high Al/(Ga + Al) region. Since Al3+ ions occupy tetrahedral
sites in the case of high Al/(Ga + Al) ratios, the density of
active sites of the catalysts decreased, thereby diminishing the
activity. For the catalysts synthesized in 1,5-PeG, the ratio of
Al/(Ga + Al), where the mixed oxide catalyst exhibited the
highest activity, was slightly higher than that for the catalysts
prepared in 2-(methylamino)ethanol. This result can be
explained by the fact that the actual Al content in the solid
solution prepared by the glycothermal method was slightly
lower than the feed ratio.
Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the crystallite size
of the mixed oxides prepared in various solvents and their
catalytic activities determined at two different temperatures.
The products having crystallite sizes of 9.5, 9.8, and 10.2 nm
were obtained in diethylenetriamine with different reaction
times (2, 4, and 8 h, respectively). With increasing crystallite
size of the catalyst, the activity increases in spite of the
fact that the increase in the crystallite size lowers the surface
area of the catalyst. These results indicate that the crystal
structure plays an important role in the activity of the
catalysts.
3.4. Surface acidity of the mixed oxides
Fig. 5 shows the relationship between the Al/(Ga + Al) feed
ratio and the acid site density per surface area of the mixed
oxides determined by the NH3-TPD technique. The acid density
per surface area was essentially constant irrespective of the feed
Al/(Ga + Al) ratio, but it varied with the reaction medium used
for the synthesis. This result indicates that the total acid amount
of the Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides prepared in a solvent
depends on their surface area. Note that the NH3-TPD proﬁles
were essentially identical (albeit with different peak height)
irrespective of the feed Al/(Ga + Al) ratio and reaction
medium. The observed independence of the acid density on

the Al content indicates that the acid sites are randomly formed
on both aluminum and gallium sites.
In our previous paper, we reported that, at a relatively low
temperature of 400 8C, the NO conversion to N2 was four times
larger than the CH4 conversion to CO2; therefore we proposed
that the reaction on the present catalyst system proceeded
according to the stoichiometry shown in Eq. (1) [14]:
CH4 þ 4NO ! 2N2 þ CO2 þ 2H2O
(1)
With increasing reaction temperature, the ratio of the NO
conversion to the CH4 conversion decreases. This is due to the
fact that methane is consumed by combustion, as shown in
Eq. (2).
CH4 þ 2O2 ! CO2 þ 2H2O
(2)
It is widely accepted that SCR of NO with methane in the
presence of O2 proceeds according to Eq. (3), which competes
with the combustion shown by Eq. (2) [2,8,15,16].
CH4 þ 2NO þ O2 ! N2 þ CO2 þ 2H2O
(3)
However, the stoichiometry of reaction (3) cannot be applied
to the present catalyst system, since the ratio of CH4/NO
converted at low temperatures was four. Accordingly, O2 was
not consumed at all at low temperatures. This was actually
observed, although these data may not have enough accuracy
because of the presence of O2 in a large excess (6.7%).
Therefore, we further examined competitive reactions, such as
Eqs. (1) and (2). The ratio of the amount of CH4 consumed by
combustion to the total CH4 conversion was estimated by the b/
a ratio illustrated in Fig. 6. Fig. 7 shows the b/a ratio at 450 8C
versus (a) the Al/(Ga + Al) feed ratio and versus (b) the density
of acid sites per surface area of the mixed oxides, respectively.
The b/a ratio was essentially constant irrespective of the feed
Al/(Ga + Al) ratio, but increased with increasing density of acid
sites, indicating that the combustion activity of the present
catalysts increases with increasing density of acid sites.
As shown in Fig. 3, catalyst activity strongly depended on
the Al/(Ga + Al) feed ratio: in the catalysts prepared in 1,5-
PeG, the highest activity was attained by the catalyst with the
Al/(Ga + Al) feed ratio of 0.778. This catalyst showed 30% NO
conversion and 10% CH4 conversion at 450 8C, while pure
Ga2O3 catalyst exhibited 4.0% NO conversion and 1.5% CH4
conversion. Therefore, independence of the b/a ratio on the feed
Al/(Ga + Al) ratio shown in Fig. 7(a) is not due to the methane
conversion level.

Some reports have discussed the effect of acidity of the
catalyst on the combustion activity. Choudhary and Rane [17]
reported that the presence of acid sites plays a key role in the
activation of hydrocarbons for combustion reactions. Dias and
Portela [18] suggested that the acid sites on the TiO2 support
in V2O5/TiO2 catalysts for the synthesis of phthalic anhydride
facilitate the formation of the total oxidation product (CO2). It
is generally accepted that acidity plays a key role in
determining the activity of catalysts for the oxidation of
chlorinated hydrocarbons, which is believed to be initiated by
the adsorption of the reactants on these sites [19–23]. The
present results (Fig. 7(b)) are in accordance with these
reports.
For supported noble metal catalysts, it is known that the
acidity of the support enhances the activity for combustion of
hydrocarbons. However, enhanced activity of this type of
catalysts is generally attributed to higher dispersion of metal
species stabilized on the acid sites [24–27].
Nishizaka and Misono [28,29] found that Pd supported on
acidic materials shows excellent performance in the SCR of NO
with methane. Various acidic supports were examined [16,30–
35]. For zeolite catalysts exchanged with metal cations other
than Pd, the importance of acidity on the SCR reactivity has
also been pointed out [36–39], although Li and Armor found
that acidity seems to play no role on Co-ZSM catalysts [40].
Misono et al. proposed that acid sites indirectly promote the
reaction by maintaining a high dispersion of Pd and directly
participate in the oxidation of NO to NO2 and the reaction of
NO2 to N2 [28,29,41]. In the present catalyst system, however,
the acidity of the catalyst rather promotes combustion of
methane and, therefore, has a negative effect on CH4-SCR.
Moreover, oxidation of NO to NO2 inherently means that the
reaction obeys the stoichiometry of Eq. (3), which is not the
case for the present catalyst system. Since the mixed oxide
prepared in dethylenetriamine has a low acid-site population,
the Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst prepared in this solvent shows a high
activity and uses methane more effectively for SCR of NO. The
present results, in a sense, resemble those reported by
Kumthekar and Ozkan for CH4-SCR of NO on Pd/TiO2
catalysts [42]. These authors reached the conclusion that the
activation of CH4 is the rate determining step for this reaction.
They suggested that the reaction network was likely to include
the NO + CH4 reaction (Eq. (1)) and methane combustion
(Eq. (2)) [42].
3.5. Reaction in the presence of water in the feed gas
Fig. 8 shows the results for SCR of NO with methane under
wet conditions. Since the presence of water in the feed
drastically decreased the NO conversion, data obtained with
twice larger CH4-concentration are shown by closed symbols.
The catalyst prepared in diethylenetriamine maintained a high
NO conversion even in the presence of water in the feed gas.
The results for the reaction carried out under more severe
conditions (lower W/F and NO concentration albeit higher CH4
concentration) are shown in Fig. 8 by open symbols. The
catalyst shows a high activity under such severe conditions, and
therefore, this catalyst has a high potential for the practical use
for CH4-SCR of NO.
4. Conclusion
g-Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides with various crystallite sizes
were obtained by the solvothermal method. In this reaction, the
initial formation of g-Ga2O3 nuclei controls the crystal
structure of the mixed oxide. Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides with
a larger crystallite size (10 nm) were prepared in diethylene-
triamine as a reaction solvent. The product showed much higher
activities than that synthesized in 1,5-pentanediol (crystallite
size 5 nm). Mixed oxides with a higher acid density per
surface area showed higher methane combustion rates. This
tendency is completely opposite to those reported for many
catalyst systems, while oxidation of NO to NO2 followed by
reaction of NO2 with hydrocarbons yielding N2 is the key step.
The Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst prepared in diethylenetriamine had a
lower density of acid sites than those prepared in other solvents,
and therefore, methane was more effectively used for SCR of
NO. The former catalyst maintained a high activity even under
severe conditions.
