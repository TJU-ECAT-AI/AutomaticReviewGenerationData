Abstract 
This study focuses on a novel route for propylene production using a transition metal (Fe, Co, 
Ni, Mn, Cu) catalyst via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with co-feeding hydrogen sulfide 
(H2S). The SiO2-supported Fe (Fe/SiO2) catalyst was found to be highly active and selective for 
PDH with co-feeding H2S. The Fe/SiO2 catalyst displayed higher stability than the commercial 
CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The durability of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst was tuned by changing the ratio of 
H2S to propane (H2S/C3) from 0.2 to 2.6: the most stable performance was obtained over the 
Fe/SiO2 catalyst with a H2S/C3 ratio of below 0.4 for 50 h. The structure of the active site on the 
Fe/SiO2 catalyst was investigated using XRD, XPS, and XAFS analyses. The co-supplying of 
H2S promoted formation of an iron sulfide species during the reaction, which was the active site 
for PDH. The thermodynamic calculations indicate that the iron sulfide active phase was 
non-stoichiometric, e.g., Fe1–xS. This structure was maintained by co-supplying H2S. DFT 
calculations of the dehydrogenation path suggest that PDH occurs on an iron sulfide 
active site via an intermediate of the propyl group combining with the surface sulfide 
ion.

1. Introduction  
Propylene is an important intermediate for production of polypropylene, propylene 
oxide, and acrylonitrile [1, 2]. The main routes for producing propylene are thermal cracking of 
naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [3-5]. In these processes, the main products are 
ethylene and gasoline; therefore, propylene is produced as a by-product. The global propylene 
production capacity reached approximately 100 million tons in 2015 [6]. The propylene demand 
will increase from about 100 million to 120 million tons by 2020; steam cracking is estimated to 
produce 60 million tons of propylene by 2020, i.e., only half of the demand [7]. Therefore, 
propylene demand is growing more rapidly than production by steam cracking. The FCC units 
are optimized for the production of gasoline, which impedes sufficient production of propylene 
to meet the demand. Therefore, a novel route for propylene production is required to fulfill the 
increased demand [8, 9]. 
Recently, significant attention has been focused on simple propane dehydrogenation 
(PDH; C3H8 → C3H6 + H2) to produce propylene [10-13]. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 is one of the 
commercialized catalysts for PDH, which was discovered in pioneering work by Frey and 
Huppke [14]. The CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst shows a high activity for PDH and excellent selectivity 
for the production of propylene: the propane conversion was about 50% with a 90% selectivity 
for propylene [15-20]. Numerous papers have been published regarding Cr-based catalysts such 
as CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/γ-Al2O3, and CrOx/ZrO2 [21-24]. However, severe coke deposition occurs 
during PDH, which quickly deactivates dehydrogenation on Cr-based catalysts. Normally, steam

can be used to suppress coke deposition; however, in this case, steam oxidizes and deactivates 
the Cr-based catalyst. Therefore, a regeneration process to combust the coke using diluted air is 
required after very short reaction periods [25]. Recently, many promising catalytic systems have 
been proposed, basing on vanadium, gallium, iron, tungsten, indium oxides or platinum 
component [26-35]. 
In our previous study, a novel dehydrogenating catalyst was explored for the PDH 
process [36]. We found that a transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni) catalyst loaded onto aluminum oxide 
(γ-Al2O3) with a sulfate ion (SO42–) was selective for PDH. Sun et al. also observed such 
promotional effect in PDH process [37]. Using this catalyst system, propylene selectivity 
improved significantly, and coke deposition was decreased dramatically by the sulfidation 
treatment, which comprised the addition of ammonium sulfate to the γ-Al2O3 precursor sol. The 
loaded sulfate species (SO42–) were reduced to sulfide ions (S2–) in the reaction atmosphere and 
then functioned as the active site for PDH. Other researchers also reported the effectivity of 
metal sulfide catalysts for the dehydrogenation of alkanes: Wang et al. investigated the catalytic 
performance of metal sulfides for dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene [38, 39]. The metal 
sulfide catalyst showed superior selectivity in dehydrogenation to metal oxide catalysts. It was 
proposed that the sulfide catalyst activates the C–H bond without breaking the C–C bond 
thereby suppressing the side reaction of isobutane cracking. Resasco et al. developed a nickel 
sulfide catalyst for dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene [40]. They proposed that the 
active site constituted nickel anchored to three sulfur species. The mechanism involves 
isobutane dissociatively adsorbing as an isobutyl cation onto the unsaturated Ni center, leaving 
H bonded to the sulfur atom. Via β-H elimination from the isobutyl cation, the β-H combines 
Journal Pre-proof
5 
 
with the H on the sulfur atom, which is followed by the formation and desorption of H2. The 
catalytic cycle is completed by desorption of isobutylene from the unsaturated Ni–S species. 
Metal sulfide catalysts are considered as one of the promising candidates for dehydrogenation of 
alkanes. However, there is a crucial problem regarding the loss of a sulfide ion (S2–) from the 
metal sulfide via a reaction with H2, which leads to decreased dehydrogenation activity [41]. 
Therefore, suppression of the release of S species from the metal sulfide is necessary to 
maintain high dehydrogenation activity. 
In petrochemical industries, hydrodesulfurization is performed to remove sulfur 
species from sulfur-containing compounds. A large quantity of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas is 
exhausted during this process. The exhausted H2S is generally removed using the well-known 
Claus process (2H2S + O2 → 2S +2H2O). However, global sulfur supplies could exceed demand 
by about several million tons, which suggests the need for a new application of H2S [42]. H2S is 
known to decompose to produce H2 and S2– on various metal components [43]. Therefore, the 
effect of the addition of a co-supplying H2S with propane on the PDH performance of transition 
metal catalysts (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu) was investigated. We expected that co-supplying H2S 
would improve the stability of the performance of the catalyst through continuous regeneration 
of S2- during the reaction. In addition, the structure of the active site of the high-performance 
catalyst was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption fine structure 
(XAFS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. Based on these results, we 
considered the active site for PDH with co-feeding H2S and the reaction mechanism by density 
functional theory (DFT) calculation.

2. Experimental 
2.1. Catalyst preparation 
The SiO2 (JRC-SIO-4) support was supplied by the Catalysis Society of Japan. The 
transition metal oxide (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu) and sulfate ions (SO42–) were loaded using an 
impregnation method: The corresponding metal nitrate (i.e., Fe(NO3)3, Co(NO3)2, Ni(NO3)2, 
Mn(NO3)2, Cu(NO3)2) and ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) were impregnated on the support 
and then evaporated until dry. After calcination of the catalyst at 700°C for 1 h, the sulfated 
catalyst, containing 5 wt% SO42– and 20 wt% transition metal, was obtained. For comparison, a 
CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared using a conventional impregnation method with 
Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (Kanto Kagaku Inc., Japan) and γ-Al2O3 followed by sequential calcination at 
650°C in air. The loadings of Cr components were 10, 15, and 20 wt%, respectively. 
 
2.2. Activity tests 
The PDH performances of the prepared catalysts, including the catalytic activity, selectivity for 
the product, and stability, were examined in a conventional fixed-bed reactor. The reaction was 
performed at 600°C under atmospheric pressure. Propane was supplied to the catalyst bed with 
co-feeding H2S, as balanced by He. The molar ratio of H2S to propane ranged from 0.2 to 2.6. 
The propane feed rate was 2.5 mL·min-1 (SATP), and the catalyst weight was 0.25 g. The 
gaseous reactants and products in the effluent gases (i.e., C3H8, CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H6) 
were collected by micro-syringe and subsequently injected into the off-line thermal conductivity 
detection gas chromatograph and flame ionization detection gas chromatograph (GC-8A; 
Shimadzu Inc., Japan). Other products except for the above products were not confirmed in the

effluent gas. In addition, carbon balance was almost 100%. Propane conversion (PC) and the 
selectivity for the products (SP) were calculated using the following equations:

where F denotes the flow rate of the reactant and products, P indicates a specific product, and N 
indicates the number of carbon atoms in the product, respectively. 
 
2.3. Characterization of catalysts 
The amount of deposited carbon on the catalyst after the reaction was measured 
using an element analyzer Flash EA 1112 (Thermo Fisher Electron Inc., USA). During the 
measurement, 15 mg of the catalyst was placed in an aluminum foil cup. The deposited carbon 
on the catalyst was oxidized by increasing the temperature from room temperature to 900°C 
under air atmosphere. Based on the produced COx detected by GC-FID-methanizer, the amount 
of coke deposition was calculated. The crystalline structure of the prepared catalyst was 
determined by XRD analysis using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å, Ultima IV, Rigaku Inc., Japan). 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100F, JEOL Japan)) operating at accelerating 
voltages of 200 kV
. The components of the products were evaluated by energy-dispersive X-ray 
spectroscopy (EDX). The Fe K-edge XAFS measurement was performed at the hard X-ray 
XAFS beamlines of BL5S1 in the Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center (Aichi SR, Japan); this 
center has an electron storage ring with a circumference of 72 m that is operated at an electron 
energy of 1.2 GeV with a current of 300 mA. The XANES spectra were normalized with respect

to the edge jump energy. EXAFS oscillation (k) was weighted by k3, in order to compensate for 
the diminishing amplitude in the high k range due to the decay of the photoelectron wave. The 
filtered k3-weighted (k) was then Fourier transformed into R space (k range: 2.0–14.0 Å–1). In 
the curve-fitting step, the possible backscattering amplitude and phase shift were calculated by 
using the FEFF 6 code. To determine the atomic concentrations of iron and sulfur species in the 
catalysts, XPS (Axis Ultra DLD; Shimadzu Inc., Japan) analyses were performed using 
monochromatic AlKα radiation. The binding energy was referenced to C1s = 284.7 eV
. 
 
2.4. DFT calculation 
Propane dehydrogenation was computed at the level of DFT by using the CASTEP. 
The exchange correlation energy was described with GGA-PBEsol. Ionic cores were described 
by the ultrasoft pseudopotential and the Kohn-Sham one-electron states were expanded in a 
plane wave basis set up to 410 eV
. A Fermi smearing of 0.1 eV was utilized. Brillouin zone 
integration was approximated by a sum over special k-points chosen using the Monkhorst-Pack 
scheme (3 3 1). Without counting the adsorbates, the vacuum between the slabs was set to span 
the range of 20 Å for the slabs without significant interaction. Geometry optimizations were 
carried out by BFGS method. Transition states (TS) were located by the LST/QST method and 
MEP method. Hubbard repulsion parameter (U=2.5 eV) was introduced for 3d electrons of Fe 
atoms. The convergence criteria for structure optimization and energy calculation were 1.0 × 104 
eV·Cell–1 for SCF, 1.0 × 103 eV·Cell–1 for energy difference, 100 eV·Å–1 for maximum force 
and 100 Å for maximum displacement.

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Propane dehydrogenation with co-feeding H2S 
The catalytic performances were investigated in the PDH with co-feeding H2S over 
SiO2-supported various transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu) catalysts (described as 
Metal/SiO2). Figure 1(a) shows the propane conversion over the Metal/SiO2 catalysts. The 
Fe/SiO2, Co/SiO2, Ni/SiO2 catalysts showed a high propane conversion at initial stage of the 
reaction. In addition, the Fe/SiO2 catalyst displayed better stability during PDH with co-feeding 
H2S than the other transition metal catalysts. The Mn/SiO2 and Cu/SiO2 catalysts showed a low 
propane conversion. The stability of these catalysts was largely dependent on the type of active 
metals. The product selectivity at 200 min is shown in Figure 1(b). Propylene (C3H6), methane 
(CH4), and ethylene (C2H4) were confirmed as the products over all the catalysts. CH4 and C2H4 
by-products were produced by propane cracking (C3H8 → CH4 + C2H4). Conley et al. have 
reported the formation mechanism of by-product over the Cr/SiO2 catalyst [44]. Cracking is 
associated with the cleavage of a C−C bond in propyl intermediate (Cr−C3H7). Then, β-alkyl 
transfer proceeds, and forms the Cr-(ethylene)(CH3) species. This Cr-species releases ethylene 
to form methyl intermediate. Subsequent proton transfer from Si−(μ-OH)−Cr to Cr−CH3 forms 
the methane. Such reaction mechanism proceeded on the catalysts, which produced CH4 and 
C2H4. Comparison of the C3H6 selectivity over each catalyst revealed that the Fe/SiO2 catalyst 
had the highest selectivity of 92.8%; this high selectivity was almost maintained throughout the 
dehydrogenation, as shown in the Supporting information (Figure S1). The C3H6 selectivities of 
the other catalysts were as follows: 88.2%, 67.5%, 58.3%, and 52.8% over the Co/SiO2, Ni/SiO2, 
Mn/SiO2, and Cu/SiO2 catalysts, respectively. In terms of the catalytic performance, the Fe/SiO2

catalyst is a suitable material for PDH with co-feeding H2S. 
The dehydrogenation performance of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst was compared to that of 
the CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, which is known to be highly active catalyst for PDH. Figures 2(a) 
and 2(b) show the yield of C3H6 with and without co-feeding H2S, respectively. Here, CrOx 
loadings of 10, 15, and 20 wt% were investigated. The CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed high 
initial activities; however, their activities rapidly decreased over time, as shown in Fig. 2(a). In 
addition, the activity of the CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts decreased even in the presence of H2S in the 
dehydrogenation atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Although the Fe/SiO2 catalyst had almost 
no activity in the absence of H2S, the addition of H2S significantly improved the performance. 
The stability of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst was superior to that of the CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The 
reason for the high activity of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst with co-feeding H2S is discussed in terms of 
the bulk structure of the catalyst in this paper. Table 1 shows the amount of coke deposited after 
PDH with co-feeding H2S. The amount of coke was a little on the transition metal catalyst after 
the PDH with co-feeding H2S; 1.2 wt% coke was deposited on the highly-active and stable 
Fe/SiO2 catalyst. While, the amounts of coke deposited on the CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with 
loadings of 10, 15, and 20 wt% were 7.6, 7.2, and 6.0 wt%, respectively; these values are higher 
than that for the transition metal catalyst. Co-feeding H2S significantly improved the 
performance of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst. 
 
3.2. Effect of H2S ratio on dehydrogenation performance of Fe/SiO2 catalyst 
Since co-feeding H2S has a profound effect on the dehydrogenation properties of the 
catalyst, the effect of the ratio of H2S to propane (abbreviated as H2S/C3, where C3 indicates 
Journal Pre-proof
11 
 
propane) on the dehydrogenation performance was investigated over the Fe/SiO2 catalyst. 
Figure 3 shows the C3H6 yield and product selectivity under various H2S/C3 values. Here, the 
partial pressure of propane was fixed at 9.7 kPa (equilibrium conversion: 70.9%) and H2S/C3 
was varied from 0 to 2.6. When H2S was not supplied in the feed (i.e., H2S/C3 = 0), the 
propylene yield was very low. Therefore, it is essential to supply H2S for sufficient 
dehydrogenation performance over the Fe/SiO2 catalyst. Upon supplying H2S (H2S/C3 = 0.2 and 
0.4), the Fe/SiO2 catalyst showed a stable performance with high selectivity for propylene. 
Furthermore, the activity was enhanced by increasing the H2S/C3 from 1.4 to 2.6; however, the 
stability and selectivity for propylene was slightly decreased. Cummins et al. investigated the 
mechanism for sulfidation of hematite to iron sulfide by feeding H2S [45]. Upon exposing 
hematite to H2S, iron sulfide formed on the hematite surface. They proposed the following 
mechanism: Above the hematite surface, H2S firstly dissociates into H2 and S. These 
compounds diffuse onto the hematite, while the iron cation (Fe3+) and lattice oxygen (O2–) 
diffuse toward the surface. The H2 and O2– react to produce H2O accompanied by the reduction 
of Fe3+ to Fe2+. The produced Fe2+ then reacts with the sulfur atom to form iron sulfide on the 
surface. During dehydrogenation with H2S over the Fe/SiO2 catalyst, the conversion increased 
over time, as shown in Figure 3. This result suggests that there is an induction period, which 
might involve reduction of the Fe cation and subsequent sulfidation. This induction period was 
shortened by increasing the H2S/C3. A high H2S/C3 might promote the formation of iron sulfide 
on the catalyst, thereby improving the catalytic performance.  
Figure 4 shows the durability of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst during a 50-h reaction period 
using H2S/C3 values of 0.2, 0.4, and 1.4. The initial propylene yield was high at a H2S/C3 of 1.4. 
Journal Pre-proof
12 
 
However, the catalyst was deactivated as the reaction proceeded: After 35 min, the conversion 
was 49.5% with 94.4% propylene selectivity; the activity was decreased to a conversion of 
15.0% with 78.2% propylene selectivity after 50 h. This result indicated that the catalyst was 
degraded significantly during the reaction. At H2S/C3 values of 0.2 and 0.4, the initial 
conversion was lower than that at a H2S/C3 value of 1.4. However, there was only a slight 
decrease in the conversion and selectivity. Additionally, the catalyst only underwent slight 
deactivation over the 50 h reaction under H2S/C3 values of 0.2 and 0.4; for example, relatively 
high conversions and 90% selectivity were obtained at a H2S/C3 of 0.4. 
 
3.3. Bulk structure of Fe/SiO2 catalyst 
Based on the results of the performance evaluation, the Fe/SiO2 catalyst was high 
performance for PDH with co-feeding H2S. To investigate the reason for this performance, the 
composition of the catalyst after PDH with co-feeding H2S (i.e., the used catalyst) was analyzed 
by STEM-EDX mapping. Figure 5 shows a STEM image and element maps of the silicon (Si), 
iron (Fe), and sulfide (S) components of the used Fe/SiO2 catalyst. From the element maps, it is 
evident that Fe and S components were detected on the catalyst, as shown in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d). 
The element map of the S species suggests dispersion of the Fe component on the SiO2 support. 
This result provides evidence of Fe–S bond formation during the reaction. The generated Fe–S 
species might play an important role during PDH in the presence of H2S. 
The XRD pattern of the catalyst after PDH with co-feeding H2S was examined to 
determine the structure of the Fe–S species in the catalyst. Figure 6 shows the XRD pattern of 
the Fe/SiO2 catalyst before and after the dehydrogenation reaction. Before the reaction, the iron 
Journal Pre-proof
13 
 
species of the catalyst had a hematite (α-Fe2O3) structure. After PDH with co-feeding H2S, the 
α-Fe2O3 structure changed to a troilite (FeS) or pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS, 0≤x≤0.125) structure. Figure 
7 describes the structural images of troilite that were reported by Skinner [46]. The structure of 
troilite is similar to that of the NiAs-type hexagonal close-packed structure with each iron atom 
octahedrally coordinated to six sulfur atoms [47]. In contrast, for pyrrhotite, the Fe atoms are 
coordinated to either five or six sulfur atoms because of metal vacancies [48]. Pyrrhotite has a 
slightly distorted NiAs-type structure with a non-stoichiometric composition including Fe7S8, 
Fe8S9, Fe9S10, and Fe10S11 [49]. The FeS stoichiometric compound and Fe1-xS (Fe8S9, Fe9S10, and 
Fe10S11) intermediates have orthorhombic and hexagonal structures, respectively. The 
iron-deficient Fe7S8 compound has a monoclinic symmetry. These Fe–S species might be 
formed by the reduction and subsequent sulfidation of α-Fe2O3 during PDH with co-feeding 
H2S. 
To verify the stable phase of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst during PDH with co-feeding H2S, 
thermodynamic calculations on these reaction conditions were performed using HSC 
Chemistry® ver. 6.0 to generate phase diagrams of the ternary component systems of Fe–H–S. 
Figure 8 shows a phase diagram of the iron species at the reaction temperature of 600°C. The 
dehydrogenation atmosphere in this calculation includes 13.6 kPa H2S and H2 as the 
dehydrogenation product at 3.0 kPa, which was the partial pressure calculated based on the 
propylene yield. The point that corresponds to these conditions is indicated in Figure 8. The 
calculation result predicts the existence of Fe0.877S rather than the stoichiometric compound FeS, 
which is not stable under these reaction conditions. In the region of a high partial pressure of 
H2S, the iron disulfide (FeS2) phase and Fe metal are stable phases when there is a high partial 
Journal Pre-proof
14 
 
pressure of H2. α-Fe2O3 on the SiO2 support was transformed to a deficient iron sulfide during 
reduction and subsequent sulfidation. Since the iron sulfide phase was only observed in the 
catalyst, this iron sulfide might be the active phase for dehydrogenation. According to Wang et 
al., sulfide catalysts have been reported as being selective for dehydrogenation of isobutane 
through suppression of the sequential reaction due to the decreased adsorption of isobutene [41]. 
Modification of the metal catalyst by sulfur increases the electron density of the surface atom, 
which facilitates a repulsive interaction between isobutene and the catalyst surface. Similarly, 
the excellent dehydrogenation performance of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst might be caused by the effect 
of sulfidation on the electronic state of the Fe cation. The high durability of the catalyst might 
be attributed to maintenance of the thermodynamically stable iron sulfide phase by co-feeding 
H2S in the feed. 
 
3.4 Identification of the iron phase  
In the presence of co-feeding H2S, iron sulfide was formed over the Fe/SiO2 catalyst 
in the reaction atmosphere. To elucidate the origins of the high performance of this catalyst for 
PDH with co-feeding H2S, the active species of the Fe-based catalysts after the reaction were 
investigated using XANES analysis. Figure 9(a) shows Fe K-edge XANES spectra of the 
Fe/SiO2 catalysts before and after PDH with co-feeding H2S. XANES spectra of the reference 
Fe species, i.e., hematite (α-Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), wüstite (FeO), and cation-deficient iron 
sulfide (Fe1-xS), are also shown in Fig. 9. Note that α-Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and FeO were obtained from 
Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). The Fe1-xS was prepared by supplying H2 and 
H2S to Fe2O3 at 700°C for 2 h. The XANES spectra of Fe1-xS corresponding to the reported 
Journal Pre-proof
15 
 
pyrrhotite phase [50]. As shown in Fig. 9(a), the XANES spectrum of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst 
before the reaction corresponded with α-Fe2O3. The XANES spectrum of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst 
was different after the reaction. The XANES spectrum of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst was completely 
identical to that of Fe1-xS. The Fe phase on the SiO2 support transforms into the Fe1-xS species 
during the reduction and subsequent sulfidation that occurs in the reaction. Figure 9(b) shows 
the Fourier transforms of filtered EXAFS oscillations k3(k) of the Fe K-edge in the Fe/SiO2 
before and after reaction into R space in the k range of 2-14 Å–1. The filtered k3(k) plots and 
the curve fitting line in k space calculated by the FEFF 6 code was shown in Figure 9(c). The 
Fe/SiO2 catalyst before the reaction showed a well-defined first Fe-O coordination shell and a 
second coordination Fe-Fe shell, which is in good accordance with Fe2O3. While, the Fe/SiO2 
catalyst after the reaction exhibited a first Fe-S coordination shell located at a distance of 2.40 Å, 
suggesting the pyrrhotite of iron sulfide phase on SiO2 support. Based on this result, it is evident 
that the iron sulfide phase is important for high dehydrogenation activity. 
To fully elucidate the role of H2S on the catalyst, catalytic performance tests and 
XPS analysis were performed on the Fe/SiO2 catalyst. The catalytic performance test involved 
the following method: firstly, PDH with co-feeding H2S was conducted, followed by purging of 
the surface adsorbate using flowing He; secondly, PDH was carried out without co-feeding H2S, 
followed by purging and desorption of the surface adsorbate (mainly physically adsorbed H2S 
on the catalyst); finally, PDH with co-feeding H2S was conducted again. Figure 10 shows 
propane conversion over the Fe/SiO2 catalyst with reaction time. The conversion reached as 
high as 50%; however, it significantly decreased when the co-feed of H2S was stopped. When 
H2S was co-supplied again to the PDH, the catalytic activity was recovered to 33.1%. Under the 
Journal Pre-proof

co-feeding H2S conditions, the catalyst surface might be covered by a surface lattice sulfide 
atom (S2–), which imparted the high activity. In contrast, during PDH without H2S, H2 reduction 
probably occurred at the expense of a surface lattice sulfide atom (S2–). Therefore, a decrease in 
the dehydrogenation activity might occur as the sulfide atoms were consumed. However, by 
supplying H2S again, the surface lattice sulfide atoms (S2–) were regenerated, resulting in a 
recovery of the dehydrogenation activity. This hypothesis was supported by the XPS analyses 
results. The surface atom concentrations for sulfur (S) and iron (Fe) atoms and the atomic ratio 
for S/Fe were obtained. Table 2 shows the atomic concentrations calculated from the areas of 
the Fe2p and S2p XPS spectra. Here, the three catalyst samples, which are indicated by red circles 
in Figure 10, were prepared by performing PDH with and without co-feeding H2S. Each XPS 
spectra in provided in the Supporting information (Figure S2). Under co-feeding H2S conditions, 
the atomic ratio of S/Fe was 1.71. Such a non-stoichiometric composition indicates that the 
catalyst surface contains excess sulfur. In contrast, removing the H2S feed from the PDH 
reaction decreased the S/Fe ratio of 1.05, which is very close to stoichiometric. This result 
implies that the catalyst surface contained the iron cation, while the surface sulfide ion (S2–) was 
probably consumed by oxidative PDH or H2 reduction in the following reactions: 
C3H8 + S2– → C3H6 + H2S 
(3) 
H2 + S2– → H2S 
 
(4) 
After resuming the co-feed of H2S, the S/Fe ratio recovered to 1.58. The surface sulfide ion (S2–) 
was regenerated through the reverse of the reaction shown in eq. (4). One possible reason why 
the S/Fe did not reach its original value of 1.71 upon the re-supply of H2S might be 
micro-structural changes in the iron sulfide due to redox cycling. Based on the atomic 
Journal Pre-proof
17 
 
concentration in Table 2, the high activity might be derived from the presence of the sulfur-rich 
iron sulfide phase. Therefore, one of the key roles of the H2S is the formation of an iron-sulfide 
phase with a sulfur-rich composition. 
Based on the performance in Fig.1 the Fe/SiO2, Co/SiO2, and Ni/SiO2 catalysts 
showed a high dehydrogenation performance, however, the Mn/SiO2 and Cu/SiO2 catalysts had 
much lower activity. There are two main reasons for the low activity over the Cu/SiO2 and 
Mn/SiO2 catalysts. Figure S3 in supporting information shows XRD pattern of used catalysts of 
the M/SiO2 (M: Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu). The metal sulfide was formed as a single phase on these 
catalysts, except for the Cu/SiO2 catalyst. While, the catalyst of Cu/SiO2 had the multiple phases 
with different valences of monovalent and divalent. The formation of such multiple phases was 
considered to cause a low activity for PDH with co-feeding H2S. The low activity of Mn/SiO2 
was possibly caused by the electronic structure of metal sulfide catalyst. Gómez-Balderas 
performed DFT study of the 3d transition metal sulfides [51]. For the Co, Ni and Fe sulfides, 
calculation results showed that the electron density of states (DOS) was existed in the occupied 
states region below the Fermi level. In contrast, the DOS of MnS is increased in the unoccupied 
states region above the Fermi level. They suggested that the possibility of a strong interaction 
with charge donating sulfur adsorbate atoms poisoned the active surface of MnS. In this work, 
H2S, which was charge donating sulfur molecule, was co-fed with propane. The charge donating 
sulfur molecule of H2S might strongly adsorb on the catalyst, which would produce a low 
dehydrogenation performance of the MnS catalyst. 
Higher H2S/C3 leads to a quicker deactivation rate than the cases with lower H2S/C3, 
as shown in Fig. 3. Under high H2S/C3 condition, the rate of consumption of S2- is accelerated 
Journal Pre-proof
18 
 
by the progress of the reactions of (3) and (4). Under such condition, the rate for the S2– 
regeneration (5) did not catch up with the rate for the consumption of S2-, which might cause 
micro-structural changes in the iron sulfide and deactivate the catalyst. 
H2S + Vs → H2 + S2–  
(5) 
Another possible reason was the accumulation of coke. Table 3 shows the coke deposition of the 
Fe/SiO2 catalyst under various H2S/C3 values. Higher H2S/C3 value caused a higher amount of 
coke deposition on the catalyst, because of the increase of the selectivity to by-products of CH4 
and C2H4 as shown in Fig. 3(b). Such accumulation of coke on the catalyst might accelerate the 
quicker deactivation. 
An important question to address is how the reaction mechanism proceeds on the 
sulfur-rich iron sulfide. Based on the structure of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst, DFT calculations were 
performed to identify potential reaction pathways and reaction intermediates on iron sulfide. 
Figure 11 schematically shows the energy diagram for PDH on the low-index (001) facet of the 
iron-sulfide phase. Note that the (001) facet of the iron sulfide was reported to be the most 
stable surface [52, 53]. As a preliminary experiment, we calculated the most stable surface state 
of the (001) facet in the dehydrogenation atmosphere by adding a hydrogen atom to the surface. 
In addition, the London dispersion force was corrected using the method reported by 
Tkatchenko and Scheffler [54]. Figure 11 indicates the stabilization energies of various 
hydrogen-added surfaces. The hydrogen atom was present on the top site of the sulfide atom 
and hollow site of the iron atom. On the basis of this hydrogenated structure as a starting point 
for PDH, the C–H bond in the second carbon of propane dissociates on the sulfide ion to 
produce an alkyl species and H atom. The produced H atom reacts with the adsorbed H atom to 
Journal Pre-proof
19 
 
produce a H2 molecule, as shown in Fig. 12. The alkyl species then bonds with the sulfide ion, 
forming the alkyl sulfide species as an intermediate species on the catalyst. Subsequently, the H 
atoms were removed from the alkyl sulfide intermediate species. The catalyst cycle was 
completed by desorption the propylene product from the catalyst surface. Yun et al. investigated 
the reaction mechanism for PDH over H-[Fe]-ZSM-5 [55]. They proposed a redox mechanism 
involving the formation of a propane radical cation as a reaction intermediate over 
H-[Fe]-ZSM-5. The reaction of PDH over the Fe/SiO2 catalyst must have proceeded via a 
similar route due to the nature of H2S. H2S could be decomposed radical species such as SH and 
H species at high temperature [56]. Propane was initially activated on the iron sulfide catalyst 
and/or radical species, to form a propane radical cation and H atom. The removed H atom 
reacted with the originally adsorbed H atom to produce a H2 molecule. At the same time, the 
Fen+ (n: 2, 3) on the iron sulfide was reduced to Fe(n-1)+ through the transfer of an electron from 
the propane radical. This generated the propyl cationic species, which interacted with the 
surface sulfide, as shown in Fig. 12 (step 3). Such an alkyl sulfide species formed as the 
reaction intermediate. The H atom was subsequently removed from the reaction intermediate. 
The catalytic cycle was completed by the production of propylene accompanied by oxidation of 
Fe(n-1)+ to Fen+. Although future work is required to verify the proposed radical mechanism, the 
present study introduced a novel dehydrogenation system, in which the lattice-S–mediated 
reaction path results in highly selective and continuous production of propylene by co-feeding 
H2S. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Journal Pre-proof
20 
 
The catalytic properties of transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu) catalyst for PDH 
with co-feeding H2S were evaluated. The Fe/SiO2 catalyst displayed a high activity and 
selectivity for the production of C3H6; its overall performance was superior to that of the 
CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. By tuning the ratio of H2S to propane (H2S/C3) in the feed to 0.4, the 
catalyst proved to be highly stable for about 50 h of reaction. Based on the structural 
characterization results of XRD, XPS, and XANES analyses, iron sulfide formed on the Fe/SiO2 
catalyst. During the reaction, the co-fed H2S promoted the formation of iron sulfide, which was 
the active site for PDH. Based on the DFT calculations, PDH occurs on the formed iron sulfide 
site via the combination of the intermediate propyl group with the surface sulfide ion.
