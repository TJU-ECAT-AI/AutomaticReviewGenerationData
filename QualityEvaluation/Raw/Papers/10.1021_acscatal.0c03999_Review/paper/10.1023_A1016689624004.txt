Abstract
The addition of reducible metal oxides as promoters shows a positive effect on the catalytic behavior of lanthanum vanadate (LaVO4). A C3H6 yield increase of 6.5% is observed at 500 °C on molybdenum-promoted LaVO4, which can be attributed to the change of the redox properties, the blocking of the strong oxidation sites of the catalysts and to an increase of the accessibility of the labile oxygen toward the reactant. The influence of the catalyst preparation method and of the Mo loading as well as the additional promoting effect of CO2 in the gas feed was also examined.
