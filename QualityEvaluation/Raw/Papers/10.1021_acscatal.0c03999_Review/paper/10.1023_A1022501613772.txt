Abstract
In the present study, we show the advantages of CO2 use for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene on the basis of thermodynamic considerations and some experimental results. Several metal oxides Ga2O3, Cr2O3, Fe2O3 unsupported and supported on g- Al2O3 and SiO2 were tested. Ga2O3 catalyst was found to be an effective agent for dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The yield of propene at 873 K was 30.1 %.
