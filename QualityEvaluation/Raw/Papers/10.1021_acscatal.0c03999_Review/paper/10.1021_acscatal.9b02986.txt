Inhibitor, co-catalyst, or co-reactant? Probing the different roles of H2S during CO2

Abstract 
Natural gas is often sour, containing varying amounts of H2S and CO2. Gas sweetening processes 
that are routinely used rely on processes such as amine-based adsorption-desorption cycles, 
membrane separation, and cryogenic technologies which are energy-intensive and reject CO2.  
This work explores the mechanism and nature of active sites for hydrogenation of CO2 in the 
presence of H2S on MoS2, a sulfur-tolerant catalyst, using steady-state kinetics studies and Density 
Functional Theory calculations. In the absence of H2S, this reaction is positive order in CO2 and 
H2 and negative order in CO and H2O; the system, further, shows no H/D kinetic isotope effect, 
thereby indicating that C-O scission is rate controlling. The specific mechanism at play, viz. redox 
or associative, could, however, not be adequately resolved with the available data. In the presence 
of H2S, the rate first drops (until about 60 ppm co-feed) and, then, remarkably increases (at > 200 
ppm) indicating a complex functional relationship of the reaction system with H2S.  A combination 
of ab initio phase diagram, kinetic experiments, and H2S-D2 scrambling studies indicate: (i) the 
edge structure of the molybdenum sulfide catalyst varies substantially with reaction conditions and 
co-feeds, (ii) multiple types of sites at play, in particular a sulfur-poor site that is active but prone 
to H2S-poisoning and a sulfur-rich site that is less active but tolerant to sulfur with a preponderance 
of data pointing to these being coordinative unsaturated (CUS) and brim sites, respectively, on the 
metal edge, (iii) H2S inhibits CO2 hydrogenation by dissociative adsorbing on these CUS sites at 
low co-feeds (0 – 60 ppm), reacts with CO2 to produce COS and CO at high co-feeds (>1000 ppm), 
and assists (or co-catalyzes) hydrogenation by acting as a hydrogen shuttle at intermediate co-
feeds.

1. Introduction
A large share of the worldwide natural gas resources is sour comprising varying amounts of 
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2).1 In addition, shale gas in the US can have up to 
100s of ppm of H2S and up to 30% of CO2.2–4 The cost of sour gas cleanup often makes natural 
gas resources containing a high concentration of acidic gases uneconomical for extraction and use. 
Active and sulfur tolerant catalysts would allow directly converting a large portion of the sour 
natural gas streams to value-added products.5 Further, a paradigm shift is essential in considering 
CO2 and H2S as an abundant source of carbon and sulfur rather than a waste stream to address the 
crucial challenges of global climate change and sustainability. Transition metal sulfides, 
molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) in particular, are good hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and 
hydrogenolysis catalysts that are intrinsically tolerant to H2S. Indeed, MoS2 has been shown to be 
active for methane coupling6 and alkane dehydrogenation7–10 in addition to their traditional use in 
hydrotreating,11 hydrodesulfurization,12,13 WGS (water gas shift)14 and alcohol production.15 Few 
studies have shown that transition metal sulfide catalysts can be high-performance sour gas tolerant 
catalysts for the WGS reaction.16–18  We begin with the description of the structure of MoS2 catalyst 
and the relevant chemistries it can catalyze.
Bulk MoS2 is a layered material having a stacking of S-Mo-S trilayers, which are held together by 
the van der Waals forces. The activity of this material has been mainly associated with the edges 
while the basal plane considered to be inactive due to sulfur saturation although vacancies present 
there could create potentially active sites.19 It has been shown via scanning tunneling microscopy 
(STM) studies that single-layered nanoparticles having a hexagonal morphology can be present 
under a reducing condition11 where the active sites are located on the edges, namely the Mo-edge 
(10 0) and the S-edge ( 010) and the corner site. Several types of sites exist on the edges of the

MoS2. Lauritsen et al. have probed the importance of brim sites in presence of -SH species towards 
the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene.20 Similarly, the formation of coordinative unsaturated 
(CUS) sites on the Mo-edge has also been reported in presence of hydrogen21 and has long been 
thought to play a prominent role in hydrodesulfurization. Moreover, a CUS site on the corner 
(located on the intersection of the Mo-edge and S-edge) has also been proposed to serve as active 
HDS centers (as compared to HDN) by Rangarajan et al.22 on promoted CoMoS/NiMoS catalyst 
for unhindered thiophenes. Maugé et al.23–27 have used CO as a molecular probe to determine the 
morphology (metal/sulfur edge ratio) of promoted and unpromoted MoS2/Al2O3 by employing

infra-red studies along with density functional theory (DFT). Figure 1 illustrates the above-
mentioned characteristics of MoS2.
Figure 1.  Pictorial representation of MoS2: a) Bulk MoS2 is composed of S-Mo-S layers held

type of edges, viz., the M- and S-edges. Several active sites that are located on these edges are also 
indicated. Molybdenum atoms are in cyan, sulfur atoms in yellow, and hydrogen atoms in white. 
Promoted18,28 and unpromoted MoS214 are the active and stable catalysts for the WGS reaction in 
the presence of H2S. Moreover, K-MoS2 have been utilized to synthesize CH3SH from 
CO+H2+H2S mixture29–33 and for the production of alcohols from syngas.15  The CO is a vital 
platform chemical for the production of methanol or long-chain hydrocarbon via Fischer–Tropsch 
synthesis. rWGS is a key reaction for transitioning CO2 to CO. The rWGS is most commonly 
performed using Cu34–36, Au37, Pt37,38 deposited on the support. However, the catalyst deactivation 
due to the sulfur sources, such as H2S, poses significant challenges.39 Alternatively, Pt40,41, Co-
MoS226,42–44, MoS214,18,44–47, La2O2SO448 have been investigated for WGS/rWGS reaction as sulfur 
tolerant catalyst. Osaki et al.49 observed that the MoS2 was highly selective towards rWGS and no 
methanation reaction was observed. Hence, MoS2 catalyst can be envisioned to be active for both 
H2S decomposition to yield H2 and perform rWGS consecutively. 
The thermodynamics of H2S splitting is more favorable than that of H2O;50,51 this presents new 
opportunities for the use of H2S as a hydrogen source. Thermal decomposition of H2S has been 
studied on metal sulfide catalysts for sulfur recovery.52 Numerous approaches, such as thermal

decomposition,53,54 thermochemical decomposition,55 membrane,56 and recirculation reactors,52,57 
photochemical splitting58 and plasma facilitated decomposition59 have been suggested to 
decompose (and thereby valorize) H2S to an H2-rich feedstock. MoS2 is determined to be highly 
active for H2S decomposition in comparison to other transition metal sulfides (WS2 and Cr2S3) at 
temperature higher than 600 oC.60 Decomposition of H2S, however, is limited by gas-phase 
equilibrium and is favored at high temperature and low pressure.61 As a consequence, MoS2 with 
intermittent removal of products can achieve up to 95% conversion at 800 oC (sub-atmospheric 
pressure 5-20 kPa) using a recirculation reactor.60 The decomposition of H2S is particularly 
important during sour gas processing where large amounts of H2S are converted annually to sulfur 
by the Claus process.62 The main disadvantage of the Claus process is the production of a large 
volume of tail gas (COS/CS2). Subsequently, the potential valuable H2 is lost to the atmosphere as 
H2O. Therefore, Bowman et al.63 suggested a thermochemical cycle for CO2 assisted 
decomposition of H2S. The H2S decomposition into elemental sulfur (T> 600 oC) in presence of 
CO2 showed increased conversion as excess hydrogen is removed via reverse water gas shift 
reaction on MoS264 and Co-MoS2.65 Su et al.66 showed that selectivity towards the formation of 
CO and S2 improved in presence of MgO catalyst. Hence, the use of an efficient water gas shift 
catalyst (MoS2) can effectively reduce the production of unwanted side product and yield valuable 
molecules such as CO and sulfur.
DFT based investigation of active sites and mechanism for MoS2 catalyst in the WGS chemistry 
has been carried out by Shi et al.45 and Zheng et al.47 The study47 suggested that the formation of 
CO2 and H2 is facilitated by the presence of a CUS site on the Mo-edge via an associative pathway 
(COOH mediated); further an undercoordinated Mo-S pair is responsible for the activity on the S-
edge via the redox pathway. However, the simultaneous reactions of CO2/H2/H2S have never been 
considered in detail before and are, therefore, the scope of the present study. 
The objective of this work, set in this broader context, is to elucidate the nature of active sites, 
kinetics, and mechanism of the reactions of CO2/H2/H2S on MoS2. The specific combination of 
reactants is chosen to concurrently (i) assess the ability of MoS2 to catalyze the hydrogenation of 
CO2 (or the reverse water gas shift reaction, rWGS) with H2 potentially obtained from alkanes 
present in natural and shale gas, and (ii) infer how H2S interacts with CO2 and with the active sites 
of MoS2. To this end, we report a diverse set of results comprising of steady-state reaction kinetic 
experiments, isotope labeling studies and atomistic insights from density functional theory (DFT).

As expounded later, our results indicate that H2S substantially influences the active sites on MoS2, 
which in turn affect the catalytic activity, and, in some cases, the product distribution. 
2. Methods
2.1 Experimental details
2.1.1 Materials and reagents.  MoS2 (99%) and SiO2 (99.995%) were purchased from Sigma 
Aldrich. 10 % H2, 10 % CO2, 1 % H2S and 100 ppm H2S (all diluted with N2) were purchased from 
Airgas. Two calibration gas cylinders, first containing CS2, COS, CH3SH, and (CH3)2S and the 
second containing 1 % H2, 1 % CO2, 1 % CO and 1 % CH4 (all in N2) were used to calibrate the 
gas chromatograph (GC).  
2.1.2 Steady-state catalytic reactivity testing. The steady-state kinetics experiments were 
performed in a quartz tube reactor (6.8 mm I.D). The catalyst was diluted with SiO2 particles to 
increase the bed length (support the catalyst) while also preventing channeling and reducing heat 
transfer gradient. MoS2 particles were pelletized, crushed and sieved to a particle size of 106 to 
150 µm. The rate of the reaction was not affected by the change in the particle size, indicating that 
the measurements were unaffected by the internal mass transfer (shown in Figure S1).67 All 
reported steady-state experiments were carried out using 100 mg MoS2 powder as the catalyst, 
diluted in 100 mg SiO2, with the reactor operating at 1 atm with negligible pressure drop. Quartz 
wool was placed in the reactor to support the catalyst bed. The temperature was ramped at 10 
oC/min to 620 oC. The catalyst was pretreated in a stream of H2S/H2 ratio of 0.1 (
 atm 
𝑃𝐻2 = 0.05
and 
 atm) for 4 hours. Gas flows were regulated by calibrated Brooks mass flow 
𝑃𝐻2𝑆= 0.005
controllers. The reactor effluent was analyzed using SRI 8610C gas chromatograph utilizing 
nitrogen as the carrier gas. Typically, the GC sampled the effluent gas every twenty (20) minutes. 
The GC was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), flame ionization detector fitted 
with a methanizer (FIDM), and combination of flame photometric detector and flame ionization 
detectors (FPD/FID). The FPD/FID detector was equipped with MXT-1 column to separate sulfur 
compounds, such as H2S, COS, CS2, CH3SH, and (CH3)2S. Small molecules, such as CO, CH4, 
and H2 were separated using MS5A and detected using a combination of TCD and FIDM detectors.  
Hayesep D column was used for separation of CO, CO2 and higher hydrocarbons that were 
detected using TCD and FIDM. Copper tubing was introduced after Hayesep D column to avoid

the deactivation of the methanizer. The lines after the reactor were heated at 120oC to avoid 
condensation of the products. The cold end of the reactor tube was used as a cold trap to capture 
any elemental sulfur. 
The total inlet flow rate was 100 ml/min, with a reference gas composition of 2% CO2, 2% 
H2, and balance being N2. The temperature was varied from 560-600 oC to obtain the Arrhenius 
plot. The reaction orders were determined at 600 oC by varying the concentration of one component 
while keeping the others fixed. In particular, concentration of CO2 [1-6 mol%], H2 [1-5 mol%], 
H2O [0.3-1.9 mol%], CO [2-4 mol%], H2S [0.0002-0.5 mol%] in the feed were varied. The amount 
of water in the feed was adjusted by bubbling N2 gas through a water saturator. The amount of N2 
flowing through the saturator was adjusted to vary the partial pressure of water in the feed. The N2 
gas flow was adjusted in the feed to compensate volume flow changes and keep the total volume 
flow constant (Vf) at 100 ml/min. Reactivity and productivity (CO or COS production) were 
calculated according to equations (1) and (2)

The first data point was collected after 2 hours of catalyst stabilization under given reaction 
conditions. Multiple data points were collected to ensure steady-state was achieved before 
reporting kinetics data. Replicate experiments reproduced reaction rates to within 10 % error. We 
have also included the catalyst characterization in Figure S2-S3 and Table S1. 
2.1.3 Kinetic reactivity testing.  SRS RGA 200 was used for transient kinetic and isotope 
exchange experiments. The consumption of H2 (m/z = 2) or D2 (m/z = 4) was quantified using 
calibrated mass spectrometry. The quantity of HD evolved was calculated from the mass balance. 
The mass spectrometer was passivated upon exposure to H2S (m/z = 34) for 2 hours before the 
data collection.  
2.2 Computational details.  In this study, the MoS2 nanoparticle edge structures were modeled as 
a single-layered periodic stripe, in view of the small size of the adsorbate relative to the inter-layer

distance, as shown in Figure 2. The periodic supercell was taken from our previous work22,68,69 
comprised of four rows of six Mo atoms along the y-axis and had at least 10 Å of vacuum in x and 
z directions to prevent spurious interactions of adsorbate and the neighboring image. The edge of 
the striped model was modified as needed by the addition or deletion of S, O or H atoms while the 
remaining Mo atoms were fully coordinated by S atoms (i.e. per bulk stoichiometry of Mo:S of 
1:2). The bottom two rows were kept fixed for a specific edge (either Mo- or S- edge) to simulate 
bulk conditions.  The nomenclature for sulfur, oxygen, and hydrogen decoration used in this study 
is as follows. Each decoration was referred to by the percentage of S (or O) relative to complete 
saturation of the Mo atoms, calculated as NS/12, where NS is the number of S (or O) atoms; H 
decoration was given by NH/ NS, where NH is the number of hydrogen atoms.  For example, 17%S 
50%H implies there are two sulfur atoms and one hydrogen atom on the edge. The model in Figure 
2 represents the 50%S Mo-edge as established in this study by ab-initio phase diagram analysis in 
section 3.5, indicating that there are 6 S atoms to a maximum of 12 S atoms possible per 6 Mo 
atoms under the pretreatment condition (as mentioned in section 2.1.2).  The S atoms on the Mo-
edge have been shifted from its conventional bulk position indicating rearrangement as previously 
reported.70

Here, the Mo-edge is shown at the top; by virtue of construction, the bottom edge is the sulfur 
edge. The Mo atoms are shown in cyan and S atoms are in yellow.

The theoretical structural calculations were performed using Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package 
(VASP), a plane wave density functional theory code.71–74 Plane waves are used as a basis set for 
representing the Kohn-Sham orbitals; an energy cutoff at 500 eV and a density cutoff at 700 eV 
were used. A Projected Augmented Wave (PAW) based approach was considered to treat the ionic 
core-electron interaction.75 The generalized gradient approximated exchange-correlation 
functional based on the parameterization proposed by Perdew, Burke and Ernzehof,76 (GGA-PBE) 
was employed along with the D3 semi-empirical dispersion correction by Grimme.77 A self-
consistent solution to the Kohn-Sham equation was obtained by iterative diagonalization of 
Hamiltonian until an energy difference of 10-4 eV or lower was achieved between consecutive self-
consistent field (SCF) iterations. A Monkhorst-Pack K-point sampling78 scheme of 1x2x1 points 
in the reciprocal lattice was employed. Gaussian smearing of 0.05 eV was employed to introduce 
partial occupancies to orbitals near the Fermi level to improve the convergence; the resulting 
energies were subsequently extrapolated to 0 K. The charge density was updated at every step 
using Pulay mixing. The dipole and spin-polarized corrections were included in the calculation of 
the electronic energy and this self-consistent cycle was followed by structure relaxation via the 
conjugate-gradient method until the Hellmann-Feymann forces on each atom were less than 0.02 
eV. The numerical convergence test with respect to K-points and the cut-off details can be found 
in the Supporting Information (Table S2). 
The lattice constant calculations for bulk MoS2 were found to be 3.163 Å at PBE-D3 level of 
theory, which is comparable to the experimental lattice constant 3.16 Å (for details regarding 
convergence parameters, Figure S5).79 The supercell dimensions for adsorbate calculations were 
27 x 18.975 x 22.5 Å. For gas-phase species, the computational settings were the same as that of 
the adsorbate calculations but with a supercell that had at least 10 Å of vacuum in all directions 
and with the gamma point sampling.
Thermodynamic corrections.  The role of thermodynamic corrections in the context of phase 
diagrams has been explored in previous studies on MoS2 based catalyst.70,80 To make such 
corrections for the adsorbates and/or slab in the supercell, the outermost row of S (O and H atoms, 
if present on the edge structure), were treated as harmonic spring which were free to move in the 
three dimensions. Such a methodology assumes frustrated modes of vibration for the translational 
and rotational degrees of freedom and hence vibrational entropy was calculated based on the

statistical mechanical calculation of the vibrational partition function. The entropy obtained was 
used to fit for Shomate parameters of each adsorbate and/or slab in the supercell, using a procedure 
explained in detail by Grabow and Mavrikakis.81 The Shomate parameters can be used to calculate 
the free energy of each adsorbate and/or slab in the supercell.
For gas-phase species, the vibrational modes were evaluated using the harmonic model for 3N-5 
or 3N-6 degrees of freedom as appropriate while the translational and rotational modes were 
described via the ideal gas and the rigid rotor approximation. Hence a procedure elaborated by 
Ochterski et al.82 which involves the separation of the rotational and translations eigenmodes from 
the mass-weighted Hessian prior to statistical treatment was employed. The details of the 
convergence setting for frequency mode calculations can be found in Table S3.
Ab initio phase diagram analysis.  It is known that the morphology and edge structure 
configuration of MoS2 is sensitive to the atmosphere of hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen,83 which 
is, in turn, linked to the catalytic activity of MoS2.20 Additionally the presence of water at the 
reaction condition, as is the case of hydrodeoxygenation reaction can lead to the presence of 
oxygenated species on the edge of MoS2.84,85 To better understand the influence of the reaction 
conditions, an ab initio phase diagram analysis was conducted. The grand potential, defined by 
equation 3, was evaluated for each of the 28 different Mo-edge and 30 S-edge decorations with 
respect to the bare edge (

In order to cover a large range of chemical potential of sulfur and oxygen, the ratio of H2S and H2 
was varied from 1.0 x 10-20 to 10 and the ratio of H2O and H2 was varied from 1.0 x 10-20 to 10; 
the chemical potential of hydrogen was fixed with respect to 2% H2. The effect of the change in 
the partial pressure of H2 (varied from 1-4% H2) was studied using a different analysis known as 
the Boltzmann analysis (as described in section 3.6) and results were included in the 
Supplementary Information (shown in Figure S7-S14).
A similar ab-initio study is conducted without water in the gas phase. In such a study, a grand 
potential, shown in equation 5, with respect to the chemical potential of sulfur and hydrogen in 
the gas phase was calculated for 24 and 28 different decorations of the Mo-edge and S-edge, 
respectively. This study is included in the Supplementary Information (shown in Figure S15-S17)

3.0 Results 
3.1 rWGS kinetics. The steady-state kinetics data of rWGS reaction on MoS2 catalyst were 
determined using a fixed bed reactor and shown in Figure 3.  The underlying catalyst stability was 
first tested and found that the catalyst showed uniform activity over 24 hours of operation, as 
shown in Figure S18.  Activation energy value determined was 67 kJ/mole in the temperature 
range from 820 to 870 K. Osaki et al.49 reported a similar activation energy of 75 kJ/mole on MoS2, 
determined in the temperature range of 500-800 K. The reaction orders with respect to CO2, H2, 
CO, and H2O were 0.60, 0.38, -0.16, and -0.68 respectively. Similar reaction orders were reported 
for H2 (0.36) and CO2 (0.73) by Osaki et al.49

Figure 3. The observed kinetics of rWGS reaction on MoS2. (a) Arrhenius plot (560-600 oC), with 
the feed containing 2% CO2, 2% H2 and balance N2. Partial pressure dependence of rWGS kinetics 
on (b) CO2 (varied 1-3 mol%) and H2 (varied 2-4 mol%), (c) H2O (varied 0.2-1.9 mol%), and (d) 
CO (varied 2-4 mol%) is also shown.  In these studies, the reference concentrations of CO2, H2, 
CO, and H2O were 2%, 2%, 0%, and 0%, with balance N2, such that the total flow rate of 100 
mol/min was ensured; the temperature was fixed at 600 °C. 
3.2 Kinetic isotope effect 
Since rWGS is a hydrogenation reaction, we evaluated the kinetics of this chemistry after 
switching the H2 stream to D2. The ratio of

conditions (shown in Figure S19) indicating that the rate-controlling events do not involve the 
scission or formation of bonds involving H atoms.

Figure 4. H2-D2 isotopic exchange at various temperatures during rWGS with equimolar H2-D2 
(1%), 2% CO2 and balance being N2 at 600 oC.
The exchange between H2/D2 was examined on MoS2 to determine the exchangeable surface 
hydrogen86,87 under rWGS conditions using calibrated mass spectrometry. The rWGS reaction was 
carried out with an equimolar mixture of the H2 and D2 (1% each) at various temperatures (as 
shown in Figure 4). The scrambling between H2 and D2 was not complete; however, the 
conversion was calculated to be twice as much as that of CO2 indicating that this reaction (or H2 
dissociation) is not rate-controlling (shown in Table S5).  We note here that Drescher et al.88 
observed that activation energy for H2/D2 scrambling varies based on oxygen chemisorption 
capacity of the catalyst (which is indicative of coordinative unsaturation) implying that more than 
one type of sites are active for exchange reaction.
3.4 Effect of low H2S co-feed (0 – 60 ppm) on rWGS kinetics 
Next, the effect of H2S co-feed on the kinetics of rWGS was explored in different co-feed 
concentration regimes. First, low H2S co-feed experiments were conducted where the feed 
concentration of H2S was varied from 0 to 60 ppm.  The corresponding steady-state reactor data is

shown in Figure 5.  The reaction rate decreased by a factor of six when H2S co-feed was increased 
to 60 ppm; the reaction order with respect to H2S [2-60 ppm] was determined to be -0.36. Notably, 
the rate remains fairly constant and attained a non-zero value beyond 20 ppm.
 
Figure 5. The rate of CO2 consumption in the presence of different amounts of H2S in the co-feed

indicated above, with the balance being N2 and the reaction temperature of 600 oC. The dashed 
lines are to guide the eye.
3.5 Effect of high H2S co-feed (60– 2500 ppm) on rWGS kinetics
Figure 6 shows the effect of the increasing H2S concentration in the feed on rWGS activity. In 
sharp contrast to the observations at low H2S co-feed (H2S<60 ppm), the rate of CO2 consumption 
increased upon increasing the concentration of H2S albeit remaining well below that of rWGS rate 
(~5.15 mmol g-1 h-1). The order with respect to H2S in this regime (200– 1000 ppm, shown in 
Figure S20) is ~0.20. Elemental sulfur deposition after the reactor was not observed. 
Subsequently, no other byproducts containing sulfur (CS2, CH3SH, CH3SCH3) were detected up

Table 1 reports the calculated apparent activation barriers and reaction orders for various H2S co-
feed cases. The production of COS was inhibited in the presence of H2. The order with respect to 
H2 for production of COS 
 was -0.36 in the presence of constant H2S co-feed (shown in 
(𝒪𝐻2→𝐶𝑂𝑆)
Figure S24).  The order of production of CO and COS are tabulated in Table S6 when the partial 
pressure of different reactant (CO2/H2/H2S) in the feed was varied.
3.6 Ab initio phase diagram and Boltzmann statistics
To understand the potential active sites at play during the conditions of varying H2S co-feed, we 
evaluated the grand potential, 
 of several edge decorations on the Mo-edge and S-
Ω𝑖(𝑇, 𝜇𝑆, 𝜇𝐻,𝜇𝑂)
edge as a function of the gas-phase partial pressure of H2S, H2O and H2 under reaction conditions. 
The resulting phase diagram shown in Figure 7 shows that the edges of MoS2 were decorated by 
S, H and O atoms under relevant reaction conditions. The region of conditions relevant to our study 
was highlighted by a blue and golden patch in Figure 7.  
The catalyst was initially pretreated in an atmosphere of H2S/H2 (0.1) as indicated in section 2.1.2. 
This corresponds to a 50% S decoration of the Mo-edge of the catalyst (shown in Figure S15 i) 
and 83.3%S decoration on the sulfur edge (shown in Figure S15 ii). A 50%S decoration on the 
Mo-edge is indicated by sulfur atoms out of phase on the edge region similar to the observed STM 
images by Besenbacher et al.89 Upon subjecting the catalyst to a feed containing no H2S, i.e., under 
reaction condition of 2% H2 and 2% CO2 (but assuming a small 0.01 ppm of residual H2S produced 
due to loss of sulfur atoms from the catalyst in a reducing atmosphere) and a 10% conversion 
towards formation of  CO and H2O, we observe a drop in the sulfur coverage that leads to formation 
of CUS like sites on Mo-edge (viz. 33%S Mo-edge) and, similarly, an under-coordinated S-edge 
(viz. 50% O decoration). The formation of CUS sites has been previously observed in STM images 
by Besenbacher et al,21 when the MoS2 nanoparticle was exposed to a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. 
Through computational calculations, Badawi et al.84,85 have indicated the existence of oxygen

presence of H2S. Both these observations were in accordance with our study, as shown in Figure

quantity of each type of decoration of the edges cannot be inferred from this plot. Therefore, we 
calculated the population of each edge decoration under the relevant reaction conditions assuming 
a Boltzmann distribution. Mathematically, the fraction of each type of decoration (χi) can be 
expressed as 
(6 .

𝑒
― Ω𝑖(𝑇, 𝜇𝑆, 𝜇𝐻,𝜇𝑂)
𝑅𝑇
∑𝑁
𝑖𝑒
― Ω𝑖(𝑇, 𝜇𝑆, 𝜇𝐻,𝜇𝑂)
𝑅𝑇
)
Such a statistic should give the highest population for the most stable edge structure as predicted 
by the phase diagram analysis. Figures 8 and 9 were consistent with Figure 7 in this regard; 
however, they also show significant populations of other edge decorations indicating that the MoS2 
nanoparticles are fairly heterogeneous. The CUS sites, which were predominant when the sulfur 
chemical potential is low as is the case during the rWGS reaction (assuming a 0.01 ppm of H2S 
and 10% conversion towards H2O formation), were observed to reduce quantitatively as the 
chemical potential of sulfur increases (i.e. with increasing concentration of H2S). Specifically, it 
was observed that as the partial pressure of H2S in the co-feed was increased, the concentration 
(referring to the Boltzmann population as calculated in equation 6) of 33%S Mo-edge 
(representative of a pair of CUS site) was depleted from 48% to 3.5% (2 ppm of H2S co-feed). 
Such a drop in the number of CUS sites on the Mo-edge was well-aligned with the drop in the 
activity of the catalyst as observed in Figure 5. An additional Boltzmann analysis was performed 
at 4% H2 in the feed and included in Figure S10 and S14 to understand the effect of increasing 
chemical potential of hydrogen, (which represents kinetic experiments to determine the order with 
respect to hydrogen), on the Mo-edge and S-edge.

edge is resilient to changes in water concentration whereas S-edge can start incorporating oxygen 
atoms, in accordance with the studies done previously by Badawi et al.84,85 The Boltzmann 
analysis, on the other hand, indicates that even the Mo-edge sulfur atoms can be replaced by 
oxygen atoms (hydroxyl groups being present on the edge, i.e. OH groups on 33%S Mo-edge)  to 
a small (~2.6%) extent. However, the S-edge is fully substituted with an oxygen atom as per the 
Boltzmann distribution under the reaction condition. Interestingly, a low ppm (2 ppm) of sulfur 
results in the complete removal of oxygenate species (viz. OH on 33%S) on the Mo-edge as 
observed by the negligible population of the Mo-edge decorated with OH species. A similar 
observation was noted for the S-edge, related to the drastic decrease in the 50%O decorated edges, 
however the presence of oxygen atoms on the S-edge was not completely eliminated. Figure 9 
represents the Boltzmann plot for S-edge.

4. Discussion 
4.1 rWGS kinetics and mechanisms on MoS2 catalyst
The reaction mechanism of the WGS/rWGS reaction catalyzed by MoS2 has been discussed in the 
literature, although no consensus has been reached. In general, there can be three routes for the 
reverse water gas shift reaction including (i) a redox pathway involving a direct C-O scission of 
CO2 on an undercoordinated site with high affinity for oxygen, (ii) formation and decomposition 
of a carboxyl intermediate, and (iii) formation and consumption of a monodentate or bidentate 
formate intermediate. Hou et al.14 argued that WGS proceeds through the redox mechanism based 
on X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and kinetics data on the MoS2/Al2O3. They suggested 
a regenerative scheme where Mo (IV) is oxidized and Mo (V) is reduced in the presence of H2O 
and CO, respectively. Lund46 developed a microkinetic model of WGS on supported MoS2 catalyst 
assuming a reduction-oxidation scheme that was able to explain several experimental observations 
such as (i) higher conversion of CO with increasing H2S, (ii) the observed rate passes through a 
maximum rate for a certain amount of steam (H2O) in the feed, and (iii) the coverages of surface 
species predicted by the model were consistent with spectroscopic data available in the literature. 
Shi et al.45 used periodic DFT to propose that the redox mechanism is the dominant pathway on 
both edges. They concluded that the OH*O*+H* step on the Mo-edge and H2O OH*+H* on 
the S-edge were likely to be rate determining.  However, the authors did not consider alternative 
reaction routes. A transient kinetic study of WGS on Co-promoted molybdenum sulfide catalysts 
indicated that an associative pathway (either ii or iii) was at play.42 Zhang et al.44 performed a 
more expansive DFT analysis on Mo- and S-edges of MoS2 with 37.5% and 50% edge coverage 
(with respect to S atoms), respectively. They concluded that the COOH mediated pathway was 
favorable on Mo-termination whereas a redox pathway was more favorable on the S-edge for water 
gas shift reaction. Finally, COOH mediated pathway was found to be favorable for rWGS on 
Mo6S8-TM cluster (TM- Pd, Pt, Ag), using DFT calculations.47 On Fe-Cr catalysts, the high-
temperature WGS (HT-WGS) has been shown to follow the redox pathway.90 The apparent order 
of reaction is first order for CO and zero-order in H2O on Fe-Cr catalyst for WGS.91,92 For the 
rWGS by Fe-Cr catalysts, the reaction order is 0 for H2 and 0.6 for CO2.93

Our results for the kinetics of rWGS can be summarized as follows: (i) the apparent barrier is 67 
kJ/mol and the order ( ) with respect to CO2, H2, H2O, and CO is 0.6, 0.38, -0.68, and -0.16 
𝒪
respectively, (ii) no observable kinetic isotope effect, (iii) an equimolar mixture of H2 and D2 
scramble, although not completely, but the rate of scrambling is higher than that of CO2 
hydrogenation. The redox pathway (illustrated in Figure 10 a) as such is not consistent with these 
observations. This is because the only way to account for the observed hydrogen order (𝒪𝐻2 = 0.38
) would be if the formation of OH* (by O* + H*  OH*) or H2O* (OH* + H* H2O*) was rate-
determining; this, however, would have shown an observable KIE. 
The observed orders qualitatively (
) indicate, as the first guess, that an 
𝒪𝐻2 < 0.5,  0.5 <  𝒪𝐶𝑂2 < 1
associative mechanism (shown in Figure 10 b) can potentially take place during rWGS on MoS2. 
Further, it can be argued that an abundant surface intermediate exists, which is likely of the form 
HCOy*; based on the general understanding of the mechanisms of WGS and its reverse and the 
DFT reports, one can argue that the reaction proceeds through a carboxyl pathway although a 
bidentate formate (HCOO*) could be the MASI (Most Abundant Surface Intermediate) in view of 
its high stability. We note that HCOO** species has been observed to be a spectator or minor 
intermediate in Pt38,94,95, Au37 and Cu34 based catalysts for related chemistries. We further note that 
DFT studies indicate that the COOH pathway has the lowest activation barrier (1.13 eV) in 
comparison to the formate (2.38 eV) and redox pathway (1.71 eV).44 However, the data do not 
conclusively point to the associative mechanism. Specifically, the dissociation of the carboxyl 
intermediate (COOH*), which would be the rate-determining step in the associative pathway, 
could exhibit secondary KIE although additional DFT calculations are necessary to conclusively 
show this. Furthermore, one of the main arguments against the redox pathway,  the observed 
hydrogen order being greater than zero, could be due to changes in the relative concentration of 
the active sites at varying hydrogen chemical potential. We note here that the decoration of the 
edges vary considerably with the conditions of the experiments (see Figures 8 and 9). We explore 
this further in the next subsection. More details of the potential energy surface at the appropriate 
edge decorations and a microkinetic analysis are needed to make a concrete assertion about the 
reaction pathway. The negative apparent order with respect to CO and H2O (𝒪𝐶𝑂= ―0.16; 𝒪𝐻2𝑂
) indicates the chemistry is inhibited by both products. CO inhibition is probably arising

from competitive adsorption on active sites because both CO2 and H2 interact with MoS2 rather 
weakly (purely dispersive). The observed inhibition by water is likely the result of a structure 
modification as evinced from the Boltzmann distribution (comparing Figure 8 and 9 with Figure 
S16 and S17). Moreover, Figures S28 and S29 indicate that the edges are not modified in presence 
of water therefore the order with respect to water is due to its chemistry unlike the case for the 
order with respect to hydrogen as discussed previously (refer Table S7 and S9).
Figure 10. A schematic illustration of the a) redox pathway and b) associative carboxyl pathway 
on the MoS2 catalyst. For illustration purposes, the CUS site on the Mo-edge is shown to be the 
active site. Molybdenum and sulfur atoms are shown as cyan and yellow respectively. 
4.2 H2S low ppm co-feed 
Our results indicate that the presence of trace amounts of H2S (<60 ppm) in the co-feed 
substantially inhibits rWGS activity as shown in Figure 5. The drop in the activity indicates that 
some fraction of the active sites were inhibited or modified in the presence of H2S co-feed. In order 
to assess this observation, an ab initio analysis was conducted to identify the type of sites. As 
discussed earlier, the active regions of a MoS2 catalyst were primarily located on its periphery 
(Mo- and the S-edges, and the included corners). Theoretical and experimental studies have shown 
the presence of variety of sites such as –SH or -MoH groups70, coordinatively unsaturated sites 
(CUS)11, brim site96,97, the edges11,21 (Mo-edge or S-edge) under numerous reaction conditions. 
The sites with sulfur unsaturation referred to as coordinatively unsaturated sites were shown to be 
active for hydrogenation (HYD) and hydrogenolysis (or hydrodesulfurization, HDS). The sulfur

vacancy may also exist on the basal plane however the energetics for such a process is large as 
compared with that on the edge (2.55 eV vs 0.9 eV) as indicated by our calculations in Table S4. 
Besenbacher et al.98 showed that the brim site exhibits catalytic activity for hydrogenation. In prior 
literature, an ab initio phase diagram has been used for the identification of the above-mentioned 
active sites as a function of the sulfur and hydrogen chemical potential and temperature of the 
system.70,80 We observe that at rWGS conditions (reaction condition), the ab-initio phase diagram 
predicts 2 CUS sites (33%S) on the Mo-edge (shown in Figure 7i) and undercoordinated Mo-O 
pair (50%O) for the S-edge (shown in Figure 7ii). Recent ab initio phase diagram reported by 
Rosen et al.80 predicts the presence of CUS sites on the Mo-edge, however, a smaller model was 
used to model the edge, as compared to our model, which would naturally exclude some edge 
decorations such as the one we predict for the Mo-edge viz. 33%S at reaction conditions for Mo-
edge (shown in Figure 7i). Moreover, the Boltzmann analysis performed in this study provides 
important information about the other type of sites (for eg, presence of CUS sites (42%S Mo-edge) 
at 60 ppm for Mo-edge as shown in Figure 8), which can exist along with the one inferred from 
the phase diagram. 
Under the reaction conditions, we observe that the S-edge was susceptible to a complete 
substitution with O atoms in the presence of H2O in the gas phase (shown in Figure 9). This 
complete substitution has been previously predicted by Badawi et al.84,85 for the S-edge, which 
they further reported to be less susceptible to adsorption of oxygenate species. To circumvent this 
problem, the authors suggested to co-feed H2S in order to preserve the S atom and the activity. We 
observe from the Boltzmann plots in Figure 9 that under a co-feed of 2 ppm H2S under reaction 
conditions, the S-edge recovers the S atoms and the Boltzmann population predicts 50%S to be 
the major decoration of edge sites. Similar observation (shown in Figure 8) was made on the Mo-
edge wherein the presence of oxygen atom (OH species on 33%S, in this case) was negligible in 
the presence of H2S (as low as 2 ppm).  For the low ppm range of co-feed of H2S (i.e. rWGS-60 
ppm), we observe that the Boltzmann plots for both the edges predict either a CUS site or 
undercoordinated Mo-S sites. The presence of CUS sites on the S-edge, in the form of 
undercoordinated pair of Mo-S, has been previously pointed out by Schweiger et al.99 and Raybaud 
et al.70 Therefore, all CUS sites on S-edge were filled up when we have complete saturation as in 
the case with 100% sulfur decoration on the S-edge unlike the Mo-edge wherein the formation of 
undercoordinated Mo-S pair results in elimination of CUS sites. Interestingly, H2S in conjunction

with 2,6-DMP was used to titrate the CUS sites present on these sulfided catalysts.100 Therefore, 
as a possible explanation for the drop in activity (shown in Figure 5), we evaluate the possibility 
of site blocking of these sulfur poor sites as predicted via Boltzmann analysis (shown in Figure 8 
and 9).
The drop in the population of these sulfur-poor sites was indicative of the fact that H2S present can 
block the site by molecular or dissociative adsorption suggested by several authors in the context 
of hydrotreating.101,102 Farag et al.101 focused their studies on two different sources (based on 
synthesis procedure) of unpromoted bulk MoS2 and found that H2S inhibited one type of catalyst 
hydrogenation products whereas the other catalysts activity gets promoted in presence of H2S. The 
authors explained this observation by suggesting that deposition of H2S in the CUS site and the 
possible role of the =SH2 group in the hydrogenation activity increase. On the other hand, the 
activity towards direct desulfurization product was inhibited in both cases. These studies, however, 
indirectly suggest that the H2S would block or form new sites as from their contrasting roles of 
inhibition and promotion. Raybaud et al.102 suggested that the Mo-S bond strength of the transition 
metal sulfide influences its activity in presence of H2S. They observed that sulfides with lower 
Mo-S bond energy such as Cr2S3 were promoted in presence of H2S as compared to MoS2. In 
addition, they have established a kinetic expression (whose kinetic parameters are related to the 
Mo-S bond strength from the BEP relations) suggesting the possible mechanism of H2S and H2 
dissociative adsorption on the main active site of transition metal sulfides. The modeling results 
suggested that the -SH groups are present primarily on MoS2 due to their high Mo-S bond 
strengths. We report DFT calculated values of equilibrium constant on the Mo-edge and S-edge in 
the SI (Table S10 and S11). It can be inferred from the equilibrium information that dissociative 
adsorption of H2S was more favorable than molecular adsorption. Such an observation was 
consistent with the observation that the Boltzmann population (shown in Figure 8 and 9) indicates 
the presence of brim like sites (50%S Mo-edge conc.) as the H2S concentration in the feed 
increases. We further investigate for the presence of –SH group by plotting the Boltzmann 
distribution for various hydrogen chemical potentials (1-4%), as shown in Figure S7-S14. It was 
observed that the edge decoration containing an –SH group has negligible population either on the 
Mo-edge or S-edge in the low ppm reaction range. This was in agreement to our past observation 
that the equilibrium constant for the deposition of S atoms is more favorable, and in this case, as 
compared to the formation of –SH species. Therefore, we posit that the sulfur poor sites get

“blocked” with S atoms by the dissociation of H2S. These newly formed sulfur-rich sites were less 
active towards hydrogenation but less susceptible to H2S, which is in line with previous 
experimental observation made on CoMoS catalyst by Liu et al.103 A reaction schematic of the 
above hypothesis of site blocking is shown in Figure 11.
Figure 11. Reaction schematic of a sulfur poor site (site ‘A’) getting blocked on the Mo-edge due 
to H2S present during low ppm co-feed (<60 ppm of H2S) resulting in the formation of Site ‘B’. 
The Mo atoms are shown in cyan, S atoms in yellow and hydrogen in white. Note: the choice of 
Mo-edge is arbitrary at this point as the activity could be coming from either the Mo-edge or the 
S-edge or the corner site.
We note that a brim site is an example of a sulfur-rich site capable of hydrogenating.98 Since the 
activity of the catalyst does not drop to zero (shown in Figure 5), a simultaneous contribution 
coming from both the sulfur poor and sulfur-rich part of the catalyst can be thought of the source 
of the rWGS activity in the low ppm regime. A kinetic model based on these two sites is proposed 
in the consequent section to investigate the nature of this sulfur poor site.

4.2.1 A two-site kinetic model to describe the MoS2 site poisoning in a low H2S concentration 
regime 
A two-site model, the nature of whose sites was assumed to be independent of sulfur partial 
pressure, is proposed in equation 7. It describes an additive and mutually exclusive combination 
of activity coming from the sulfur poor site, hereby represented as site ‘A’, and the sulfur-rich 
hereby represented as site ‘B’ of the catalyst.

that the blocking of the site ‘A’ with S atoms was responsible for the loss in activity. Consequently, 
a site ‘B’ which was sulfur-rich was formed resulting in an increase in its quantity and therefore 
activity coming from site ‘B’. An interconversion parametric term,  was introduced to capture 
𝛼
this increase in activity coming from the newly formed site ‘B’. We assumed that the rate arising 
from the site ‘B’ was independent of the sulfur partial pressure. A modified version of equation 7 
was used to model the reactivity in the low ppm regime (i.e. <60 ppm) and is shown in equation 
8.

for  can be derived intuitively since the sulfur-rich site was formed in place of the sulfur poor

site, therefore a ratio of

Figure S30 shows that two types of sites (the CUS site on the M-edge and an oxygen-containing 
site on the S-edge) correlate with the reaction rate, indicating that the two types of sites (A and B) 
can be on both edges. Here, we use data from our M-edge calculations; the results based on the S-
edge are in the supplementary information (Figure S31 and Table S12). The M-edge contains 
varying edge decorations of sulfur poor sites and/or sulfur-rich sites depending on the chemical 
potential of S and H (see Figure 8). We note here that the presence of oxygen to a first 
approximation can be considered under the two-site model definition as a sulfur poor site since 
their population was low (around 3 %). Equation 10 was used to calculate the net fraction of sulfur 
poor sites,

The model in Equation 9 was fit to experimental data (low H2S co-feed) (see Figure S26 a for 
details) for T=873.15 K. The results are tabulated in Table 2. Figure 12a shows that this model 
fits very well with the data. We note here that we have not considered site reported in the literature 
if our calculations do not show a high concentration of them. Previous studies involving HDS of

is three orders of magnitude lower as compared to the partial pressure of hydrogen in the HDS 
conditions (around 10 bar). Hence, -SH groups were not considered in the present model. 
Moreover, oxygenated species can also be considered into the model building process, however 
since their population was small, it was not considered in the model as well. 
Table 2.  Model parameters used in equation 9, fitted to the reaction data (T=873.15 K) in the low

on equation 10 and 11. An error of 0.1 mmol/g-hr is assumed towards the calculation of the 
experimental rates as obtained from Figure S26 a). The error range is therefore obtained for the

Clearly, from Table 2,

intrinsically twenty-five times more active than ‘B’, reinforcing the hypothesis of the two-site 
model. The inhibition constant 
can be compared with DFT-derived estimates of equilibrium

constants of site blocking on the Mo-edge (i.e. compared with values in Table S10). We find that 
the value estimated in Table 2 is consistent with dissociative adsorption of H2S on

 Furthermore, the model can provide an independent quantification of the available sites ‘A’ (i.e. 
CUS sites on M-edge) under a given H2S co-feed using equation 12; this can be directly compared 
with the Boltzmann distribution using equation 10.

Figure 12 b) shows this comparison. We note that the initial concentration of CUS sites was 
identical for both the methods because the initial ratio of the two sites was taken from DFT-based 
Boltzmann distribution for subsequent conditions, the predictions of the model were remarkably 
close to DFT. We, therefore, infer that two-site model based on the CUS and brim region of the 
Mo-edge can describe some critical features of the reaction in the low ppm regime. Figure 11 
highlights the two sites, namely CUS and brim region of the Mo-edge.
Figure 12.  The two-site model (as given by equation 9), is fitted to the experimental data for 
rWGS reaction in low ppm regime of co-feeding of H2S. (a) shows  the fit of the model to the 
experimental data (annotations are consistent with the markers on the graph of the right inset) and 
(b) shows the fraction of total sites remaining that are ‘sulfur-poor’ as estimated from the model 
(in red) and as obtained from DFT via the Boltzmann analysis (in blue) for the CUS sites on the 
metal edge. The experimental condition are as follows, 1-rWGS condition (having CO2 and H2 in 
the inlet stream and 0.01 ppm of H2S representative of H2S lost during reaction); 2- rWGS 
condition with 2 ppm co-feed of H2S; 3- rWGS condition with 6 ppm co-feed of H2S; 4- rWGS 
condition with 10 ppm co-feed of H2S; 5- rWGS condition with 40 ppm co-feed of H2S; 6- rWGS 
condition with 60 ppm co-feed of H2S. 
Figure S26 a) illustrates the reactivity at different temperatures (i.e. T=833.15 K - 873.15 K) in 
the low ppm regime. The two-site model can be modified to incorporate this temperature-
dependent reactivity data to further elucidate the nature of the sites present on the Mo-edge of the 
catalyst. To a first approximation, the intrinsic activities of the site ‘A’ and ‘B’ of the Mo-edge

Table 3 shows the results of the two-site model fitted to the temperature-dependent reactivity data. 
We note that the activation barriers, as predicted by the experiments (for no co-feed of H2S) is 67 
kJ/mol (shown in Figure 3 a)). This is closer to the barrier of the sulfur-poor site (Site ‘A’). This 
value does not compare well with the activation barrier of site ‘B’. We note here that the error on 
Ea, Brim is quite large, plausibly in view of site’s relatively smaller contribution to the overall rate 
and, consequently, a lower numerical sensitivity of its activity to temperature relative to the CUS 
site.  
The thermochemistry of H2S blocking on the Mo-edge was provided in Table S10. We observe 
that the enthalpy and entropy of reaction as calculated from DFT, for H2S blocking on 33%S (2 
CUS sites) Mo-edge was comparable to the value obtained from the model within the error range. 
This observation was consistent with the Boltzmann analysis for the reaction condition (involving 
no co-feed of H2S) wherein 33%S has the major population. We, therefore, infer that the sulfur 
poor site can be better represented by a 33%S Mo-edge model. To investigate this claim further, 
we are currently exploring the kinetics of the rWGS chemistry on the 33%S Mo-edge using DFT; 
this will be the subject of a follow-on publication. 
The two-site model was also applied assuming the sites were on the S-edge as shown in equation 
S4. Figure S31 a) shows that the two-site model fits well to the data; however, the model-predicted

changes in the site concentrations were not consistent with DFT based Boltzmann analysis (shown 
in Figure S31 b). 
 As indicated in section 4.1, the observed order with respect to hydrogen could be due to changes 
in the edge decoration. To evaluate this, we extrapolate the two-site model to different hydrogen 
partial pressures. As shown in detail in the supplementary information, using equation S2 and 
equation 9, we are able to calculate the overall reactivity for a different H2 partial pressure (i.e. 
either 1%, 3% or 4%), from which an order can be calculated assuming to a first approximation 
that the activity of each site was not dependent on hydrogen (i.e. their intrinsic order was zero). 
We found that the order with respect to hydrogen can vary from ~0 to 0.8 (Table S9) depending 
on the H2S concentration we assume at rWGS conditions. This indicates that the observed order 
could, at least in part, come from the changes in the relative concentration of the sulfur-rich and 
sulfur-poor sites upon co-feeding different amounts of hydrogen.  
4.3 H2S high ppm co-feed 
Our results for the kinetics of CO2 hydrogenation when H2S>60 ppm in the co-feed can be 
summarized as follows: (i) the apparent barrier was 74 kJ/mole for 200 ppm H2S in the co-feed 
and the apparent barrier decreases in the presence of higher concentration of H2S in the co-feed 
(Ea = 65 kJ/mole when H2S = 1000 ppm in the co-feed, shown in Figure S23), (ii) the reaction 
order with respect to CO2 was found to be almost constant with varying amount of H2S (0-2500 
ppm, shown in Figure S21-S24 ) in the co-feed, (iii) the order with respect to H2 was dependent 
on the H2S concentration in the co-feed. Notably, we observe zero order with respect to H2 when 
the H2S was ≥500 ppm in the co-feed (shown in Figure S22-S24), (iv) the reaction order with 
respect to H2, CO2 and H2S for the formation of CO and COS were also determined.  The apparent 
barrier and reaction orders are summarized in Table 1 and Table S6. The CO2 + H2S reaction was 
also observed under our experimental conditions. The CO, COS, and sulfur (Sx) were observed as 
the reaction products which is consistent with the literature reports (shown in Figure S32).66,104 
Subsequently, H2S-D2 exchange study was performed to check whether H2S can dissociate in the 
presence of D2 under the reaction conditions (600 °C). The feed for H2S-D2 exchange study 
contained 0.6% H2S (6000 ppm), 2% D2 (or 2% H2) and balance being N2 (shown in Figure S33).

We observe that the H2S can dissociate in the presence of D2 and lead to the formation of H2 and 
DH as the products. 
The two-site model was extrapolated to determine the rate of the rWGS reaction at high 
concentrations of H2S (>60 ppm, using equation 9) in the co-feed. It was observed from the two-
site model that when H2S ≥ 60 ppm in the co-feed, the rate of the rWGS was almost constant as 
the reaction proceeds primarily on the brim sites (shown in Figure 13). Since rWGS is almost 
constant, a secondary reaction pathway is plausibly responsible for the steady increase in CO 
production with increasing H2S concentration in the co-feed (shown in Figure 13).

between 200-5000 ppm) for CO production. See equations 14 and 9 for the contribution of

We observed that the apparent barrier slightly decreases when H2S in the co-feed was increased 
from 200 ppm to 1000 ppm. This may indicate a change in chemistry and edge structure. This 
observation is consistent with our DFT calculations which indicates the potential of a higher sulfur 
coverage on both edges when H2S ≥ 60 ppm in the co-feed (shown in Figure S8 and Figure S12). 
We observe a similar activation barrier for the different amount of H2S (500, 1000 and 2500 ppm) 
in the feed, which suggests a similar rate-controlling step. The observed reaction order for H2 (𝒪𝐻2
 decreases to zero when H2S was ≥500 ppm in the co-feed. A possible explanation for the 
→0)
observed reaction order is that the H2S dissociates and saturates the edge with H*. But this is in 
direct disagreement with our Boltzmann distribution (shown in Figure S7-14) which indicates that 
the Mo-edge and the S-edge are not saturated with H* under our reaction conditions. The 
Boltzmann distribution, however, predicts more S coverage at higher H2S in the co-feed. Hence, 
it is possible that the secondary pathway involves a sulfur-containing species. The secondary 
pathway assumes that the observed increase in CO production is due to H2S assisted CO2 reduction 
in the presence of H2 (shown in Scheme 1). 
Scheme 1. Proposed elementary reaction steps (reaction network) for CO2 hydrogenation in the 
presence of high H2S co-feed are as follows
(I)
𝐶𝑂2 ∗+ 𝐻2𝑆∗ →𝐶𝑂𝑂𝐻∗+𝑆𝐻∗

The COS was observed as a byproduct of the reaction, and its formation was detectable when the 
H2S was greater than 1000 ppm in the co-feed. We posit that the formation of COS proceeds 
through the reaction between CO* and –S* deposited on the edges. Solid sulfur was not observed 
to be deposited at the cold end of the reactor suggesting that the formation of S* on the edges via 
(IV) or (V) was followed by its consumption by (V or VI). We posit that the production of COS is 
responsible for maintaining the edge structure (-S coverage) in steady-state conditions.

Furthermore, we observed that the production of COS was strongly dependent on H2S (𝒪𝐻2𝑆→𝐶𝑂𝑆
), whereas the production of CO (
) was weakly dependent on H2S. It was also 
 ~1
𝒪𝐻2𝑆→𝐶𝑂= 0.26
observed that the COS productivity was inhibited in the presence of H2 (
); it has 
𝒪𝐻2→𝐶𝑂𝑆= ―0.36
been reported that the formation of COS is inhibited in the presence of H2 during the synthesis of 
CH3SH on a W-K-Al2O3 catalyst.105 The observed COS inhibition by H2 is likely the result of a 
structure modification (i.e. a lower –S coverage) as evinced from the Boltzmann distribution 
(Figure S7, S11 compared to Figure S10, S14) upon increasing H2 feed. Similarly, the increased 
production of COS at higher H2S in the co-feed could be due to the higher –S coverage. The 
production of COS, therefore, highlights the role of H2S as a co-reactant. Moreover, we note that 
the reaction orders with respect to CO2 for the production of CO and COS are similar (0.6) when 
H2S was 2500 ppm in the co-feed (Figure S24 c). It suggests that CO and COS are produced in a 
parallel reaction pathway and both the products forms through a common intermediate.  
When the co-feed of H2S was between 60 and 1000 ppm, no sulfur-based byproduct was observed. 
It is possible that the COS was undetectable at these intermediate concentrations of H2S in the co-
feed. When we extrapolate the rate data (shown in Figure S24) for COS formation to lower H2S 
co-feeds, we noted that the formation of COS would drop to zero when H2S < 500 ppm in the co-
feed. The absence of sulfur byproducts in the effluent indicates that the H2S does not get consumed 
under these conditions; the increased activity of the catalyst, on the other hand, indicates to a co-
catalytic effect of H2S at these conditions. Moreover, we observed the formation of H2 and HD 
during H2S-D2 exchange experiment. The H2S-D2 experiment points out that H2S is dissociating 
on the catalyst and the gas phase D2 is interacting with the intermediate sulfur species present on 
the catalyst (via reaction III and V). Based on the following experimental observation, we posit 
that H2S may be acting as a conduit for H* transfer to CO2. The proposed reaction pathway is as 
follows: H2S reacts with CO2 to yield CO and subsequently forms an intermediate sulfur species 
on the edges (reactions I and IV). Now, the sulfur species can interact with surplus H2 (adsorbed 
or gas phase) and leave the surface as H2S to complete the catalytic cycle and maintain a steady-
state concentration of -S on the edges (reaction III). The dynamic effect of the H2S on the active 
sites, reaction rate, and byproducts underscores a complex reaction network is at play which is 
currently under investigation using DFT to identify the most probable reaction pathway.

5. Conclusion
In the present work, the mechanism and actives sites of the rWGS reaction on MoS2 has been 
explored via kinetic experiments and DFT calculations. The reaction rate depends more strongly 
on CO2 (0.60) compared to H2 (0.38) under equimolar ratio of CO2:H2. Reaction rates measured 
under H2 and D2 revealed absence of kinetic isotope effect for rWGS.  The relative contribution of 
redox vis-à-vis the associative pathways could not be easily resolved; we posit that DFT with 
microkinetic analysis will provide such a conclusive proof and is the subject of a follow-up study. 
In the presence of H2S (60 ppm) the conversion dropped by 6x (CUS site inhibition). The presence 
of H2S has an inhibitory effect on rWGS reaction and low ppm H2S (<60 ppm) experiment showed 
the rate dependence of -0.36 based on
. The kinetic and DFT analysis provides evidence of a 
 𝑃𝐻2𝑆
two-site model, a very active sulfur-poor site that is susceptible to H2S and an H2S-tolerant sulfur-
rich site that has a relatively lower hydrogenation activity. In contrast, when H2S (>200 ppm), the 
CO production steadily increases with increasing concentration of H2S in the co-feed (H2S order~ 
0.20). Furthermore, no side product (COS/Sx) were observed (200 to 1000 ppm) implying an H2S-
assisted pathway is at play, alluding to its role as a co-catalyst. When H2S >1000 ppm in the co-
feed, the CO production is accompanied by the formation of additional COS and hence, 
establishing the role of H2S as a co-reactant. The formation of Sx species can take place in absence 
of H2. Hence, the H2S can act as an inhibitor, co-catalyst and a co-reactant for CO2 hydrogenation 
based on 
 in the co-feed.
