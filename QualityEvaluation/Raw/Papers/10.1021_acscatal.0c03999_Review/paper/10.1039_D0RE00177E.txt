Abstract
The application of catalytic mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactors show 
great promise for industrial processes to produce value-added chemicals. A catalytic 
membrane reactor combines separation and reaction in one unit and also synergistically 
enhances the membrane permeability and catalyst activity, resulting in process 
intensification. This article presents a review on the development of O2 permeable, H2 
permeable and CO2 permeable catalytic mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactors 
for methane conversion. Majority of such studies focus on the application of O2 
permeable ceramic membrane reactors while fewer applications of H2 permeable and 
CO2 permeable ceramic membrane reactors have also been reported. These catalytic 
mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactors are mainly applied in several CH4 
conversion reactions, such as partial oxidation of methane (POM), steam reforming of 
methane (SRM), dry reforming of methane (DRM), oxidative/nonoxidative coupling of 
methane (OCM/NCM), methane aromatization (MA) and bi-functional membrane 
reactors. The performance, advantages and challenges of catalytic membrane reactors 
for various reactions are summarized and discussed. Finally, the prospects and direction 
of future development of mixed conducting membranes for industrial application are 
discussed and highlighted.

Introduction
Dense ceramic membranes made from mixed conducting materials have attracted 
intense research interest in the past decade owing to their potential applications in gas 
separation and various catalytic reactions at high temperature 1-3. There are mainly three 
types of mixed conducting ceramic membranes: (1) oxygen permeable mixed oxygen 
ion and electron conductive membranes; (2) hydrogen permeable mixed proton and 
electron conductive membranes; (3) carbon dioxide permeable dual phase mixed 
oxygen ion and carbonate ion conductive membranes. 
Among these mixed conducting ceramic membranes, oxygen permeable mixed 
ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) membranes have been widely studied and 
reported. For example, perovskite membrane with ABO3-Œ¥ Structure, oxygen transport 
through this membrane is only via the diffusion of mobile oxygen vacancies and 
electronic defects, the purity of permeated oxygen can reach 100%. Perovskites have 
been widely investigated as MIEC materials with high oxygen permeability 4-6. 
Generally, perovskites with the typical formula ABO3-Œ¥, alkaline metal (Ba, Sr, Ca, etc) 
or rare earth metal (La, Pr, etc) occupy A-site of perovskite materials, while transition 
metal (Co, Fe, etc) occupy B-site of perovskite materials6-9. It is well known that oxygen 
vacancies 
 are formed in these solid oxides to satisfy the requirement of electrical

neutrality. On the side of the membrane where the oxygen partial pressure is high, 
gaseous oxygen adsorb on the membrane surface to form surface oxygen, then these 
molecular oxygen 
 can react with oxygen vacancies 
 to form lattice oxygen

side of the membrane where the oxygen partial pressure is low10. Additionally, 
perovskite materials with another structure K2NiF4 have been also widely investigated 
for high-temperature electrochemical applications, such as cathodes of solid oxide fuel 
cells. The oxygen transport in K2NiF4-type perovskite materials occurs via an 
interstitial migration mechanism; the incorporation of extra oxygen into rock-salt layers 
of the K2NiF4-type structure is charge-compensated by hole generation in the perovskite 
sheets11.

Air separation process via a membrane system exhibits many advantages over 
conventional technologies, such as high energy-efficiency, simplified operation and 
remarkably reduced costs. For example, oxygen production from air separation through 
the perovskite membrane is expected to reduce the cost by 30% as compared to 
traditional energy-intensive cryogenic air separation or pressure swing adsorption 
process.7. Better yet, integrating oxygen permeable MIEC ceramic membranes with 
catalysts to form membrane reactors allow separation and reaction to be carried out 
simutaneously. Integrated membrane reactors can provide a highly efficient route and 
have been widely applied for methane conversion reactions, such as partial oxidation 
of methane (POM), oxidative steam reforming of methane (OSRM), oxidative dry 
reforming of methane (ODRM), oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), oxidative 
methane aromatization (OMA) and so on 12, 13. A brief schematic of the catalytic oxygen 
permeable MIEC membrane reactors for various reactions is shown in Fig. 1(a). 
Generally, air as an oxygen source is fed into the lumen side of the tubular/hollow fiber 
membrane reactors, while a few studies also reported N2O and H2O as oxygen source 
via deNOx and water splitting (WS) reaction in the lumen side of membrane reactors. 
Meanwhile, CH4 as the main reactant is introduced on the shell side of membrane

reactors where reaction takes place. The catalyst is either packed outside the membrane 
or coated on the membrane surface. Hence, the oxygen ions (dissociated from the 
oxygen molecules on the high temperature activated MIEC membranes) will react with 
the reactant gases on the catalyst bed. The continuous consumption of the oxygen ions 
by oxygen-consumable reactions retains the oxygen partial pressure difference required 
for allowing the continuous permeation of oxygen from air or other oxidants (N2O and 
H2O) for supply to the reactor bed 7.
There are several other remarkable advantages of using oxygen permeable MIEC 
ceramic membrane reactors, e.g. (1) oxygen permeable MIEC membranes supplies 
lattice oxygen which can partially oxidize hydrocarbons rather than promoting 
complete combustion, thereby increasing the reaction selectivity and productivity14; (2) 
it also helps to uniformly distribute oxygen along the length of the reactor to prevent 
hot spots; (3) carbon formation on the catalyst surface can be supressed as more surface 
oxygen species are available for reaction with the carbonaceous species forming the 
CO component of syngas. The catalytic performance of the reforming catalyst will, 
therefore, be more stable15. In addition, the coupling of dense ceramic oxygen 
permeable membranes with the intended chemical reaction creates a synergy between 
these two systems. This unique technique is expected to be a promising route in 
achieving green and sustainable chemistry driven processes. One of the earliest 
industrial applications of oxygen permeable MIEC membrane reactors was studied for 
propylene dimerization by British Petroleum (BP) in the 1980s. Besides, BP also 
developed Electropox process to use the catalytic MIEC membrane reactor for POM or 
OSRM reactions. Subsequently, Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) also investigated 
catalytic membrane reactors for OCM and olefin epoxidation reactions16.

Mixed proton and electron conducive (MPEC) membrane is another type of mixed 
conducting ceramic membranes, which can permeate H2 via proton conduction in 
hydrogen-containing atmosphere at high temperature. The increasing need of large 
amount of H2 for clean fuel and chemical process leads to great interest on hydrogen 
permeable MPEC membranes. Generally, there are three types of proton conducting 
ceramics oxides that are most studied for hydrogen permeable ceramic membranes: (1) 
SrCeO3 2, 17-19, (2) BaCeO320-22, (3) defective fluorites23. Proton conductive perovskite 
materials generally have larger lattice volume than oxygen permeable perovskite 
membrane materials because proton conduction in MPEC is processed via hydroxide 
species (OH) which is larger than oxygen ion (O2-) 24. The mechanism of hydrogen 
permeation through MPEC membranes is followed: the protons do not transport as free 
interstitial ions but rather associate strongly with a lattice oxygen and migrate by 
hopping between adjacent lattice oxygen from higher H2 partial pressure side to lower 
H2 partial pressure side 25, 26. In wet atmosphere, water vapor can react with oxygen

To achieve high hydrogen permeation flux, the membrane materials should have 
both appreciable proton and electron conductivity in non-galvanic mode. In most 
MPEC materials, protonic conductivity is much higher than electronic conductivity. 
Hence, electronic conductivity limits H2 permeance through MPEC membranes18. To

increase the electronic conductivity of MPEC materials, three effective ways can be 
used, i.e. doping aliovalent ions in Ce3+ site, adding a metal phase to proton conducting 
ceramic powders or doping other high electronic conductive phase ceramic materials in 
proton conductive ceramic powders to form dual-phase composite ceramics. The effect 
of doping different aliovalent ions on hydrogen permeance has been investigated by 
many researchers. Many good hydrogen permeable MPEC membranes have been 
reported, such as SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3-Œ¥17, 19, 27, SrCe0.95Tm0.05O3-Œ¥2, 18, SrCe0.95Tb0.05O3-Œ¥25,

Œ¥32. Secondly, doping metal phase in MPEC materials remarkably increases electronic 
conductivity of materials, thereby improving H2 permeation through these cermet 
membranes. For example, Ni-BaCe0.95Tb0.05O3-Œ¥ cermet membrane shows a remarkable 
H2 permeance, although the stability needs to be improved33. Lastly, dual-phase 
composite ceramics with protonic and electronic phase, such as BaCe0.85Co0.1Tb0.05O3-
Œ¥-Ce0.85Gd0.15O2-Œ¥34, BaCe0.85Fe0.15O3-Œ¥-BaCe0.15Fe0.85O3-Œ¥ 35, demonstrate a good 
hydrogen permeability and stability.  
Generally, H2 permeable MPEC membranes work above 600oC and have a good 
mechanical and chemical stability at high temperature. Hence, it is suitable for 
integrating with catalysts to form catalytic H2 permeable MPEC membrane reactor for 
H2 production reactions with operation temperature above 600 oC, such as steam 
reforming of methane (SRM), dry reforming of methane (DRM), non-oxidative 
coupling of methane (NCM) and methane aromatization (MA). The advantage of 
catalytic H2 permeable MPEC reactors is to not only separate pure hydrogen from the 
reaction system but to also help overcome the thermodynamic equilibrium of some 
reactions, thereby improving the products yield. Fig. 1(b) shows the schematic diagram

of catalytic hydrogen permeable MPEC membrane reactors for various reactions. 
Simultaneously, the produced hydrogen from reaction is separated by H2 permeable 
membranes driven by hydrogen partial pressure gradient generated by sweep gas and/on 
vacuum condition on the other side of the membrane.
Due to rapidly increasing global warming by carbon-dioxide emission, CO2 
capture and conversion is the most promising solution to prevent greenhouse effect. 
Membrane separation process is the most potential method for CO2 separation due to 
low cost, easy operation and high energy efficiency. A large amount of CO2 comes 
from flue gas which is too hot to separate by polymer membranes. In this case, it is 
highly desirable and economically advantageous to capture CO2 directly from gas 
mixture at a high temperature without cooling. Recently, a new promising membrane 
consisting of mixed conducting materials for CO2 capture and conversion at high 
temperature was firstly proposed by Lin‚Äôs group 36, 37. CO2 permeable mixed conducting 
ceramic membranes are made by mixed oxide-ion and carbonate-ion conductive 
(MOCC) dual-phase ceramic (O2--conductor)-carbonate composite, such as 
Sm0.15Ce0.85O1.925 (SDC) - molten Li/Na/K2CO338-41, Bi1.5Y0.3Sm0.2O3-Œ¥ (BYS) - molten 
Li/Na/K2CO336, 42, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-Œ¥ (LSCF) - molten Li/Na/K2CO33, 43, 44, YSZ -

La0.85Ce0.1Ga0.3Fe0.65Al0.05O3‚àíŒ¥ 
(LCGFA) 
- 
molten 
Li/Na/K2CO346. The mechanism of CO2 permeation through MOCC membranes is that 
oxygen ions (O2-) within the oxygen ion conducting phase react with CO2 on the surface 
of feed-gas side (upstream side) to form CO32- which then passes through the membrane 
in the carbonate phase driven by the partial pressure gradient of CO2 between the 
upstream and downstream sides of the membrane. On the sweep gas side (downstream 
side), pure CO2 is released and the charged oxygen ions remain in the oxygen ion 
conducting phase, as shown in Reaction (4) 3.

CO2 permeable mixed conducting memrbanes not only represent a new direction 
for high temperature CO2 separation but also provide a potential application to construct 
a membrane reactor for coupling other reactions at high temperature. Generally, to 
permeate CO2, BYS-molten carbonate membrane, SDC-molten carbonate membrane 
and YSZ- molten carbonate membrane work at 550¬∞C and above 36, 45, 47, 48, LSCF-
molten carbonate membrane work at 700¬∞C and above 3, 44. The operating temperature 
for the dual-phase carbonate membrane matches the reaction temperature for several 
high temperature reactions that use or produce CO2. For example, MOCC membrane 
reactors can be applied for simultaneous DRM reaction and CO2 capture from hot flue 
gas, and simultaneous CO2 removal from SRM reaction to proudce H2 as shown in Fig. 
1 (c). 
There are different geometries of mixed conducting membranes, such as disk, 
tubular and hollow fiber. Among these types of membranes, the hollow fiber membrane 
with advanced configuration have numerous advantages as compared to other 
membranes, such as high surface area to volume ratio, high oxygen permeation flux 
due to thinner wall of membranes and also avoids high temperature sealing problems 
49, 50. Most reviews so far have only discussed the materials and separation performance 
of mixed conducting ceramic membranes. Only few reviews have discussed the 
application of mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactors 1, 7, 12, 51-53. In this review, 
we particularly focus on catalytic mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactors and 
comprehensively discuss O2, H2 and CO2 permeable mixed conducting membrane 
reactors for high-temperature methane conversion reactions. The entire review is 
divided into different subsections. To begin with, in section 2 we have reviewed each 
reaction involving methane conversion reaction where various types of membrane

reactors were applied. For examples, partial oxidation of methane (POM) (Sec. 2.1), 
steam reforming of methane (Sec.2.2), dry reforming of methane (DRM) (Sec.2.3.), 
oxidative/non-oxidative coupling of methane (OCM/NCM) (Sec.2.4), methane 
aromatization (MA) (Sec.2.5.) and bifunctional membrane reactors where two reactions 
take place simultaneously and balance the mass and heat transfer (Sec. 2.6.). In these 
sections, the progress and challenges of mixed conducting membrane reactors are 
discussed in detail with more emphasis on the advantages of coupling with the 
membrane. Furthermore, in section 3, general problems of mixed conducting 
membrane reactors are discussed in detail to provide an outlook for the future 
development in industrial applications. The major discussion includes the effect of 
reaction on the permeability through mixed conducting membranes (Sec.3.1), chemical 
stability (Sec.3.2.), high-temperature sealing techniques (Sec 3.3), the configuration 
and stability of mixed conducting membranes (Sec 3.4), heat management in the mixed 
conducting membrane and finally the state-of-art in industrial development (Sec.3.5).

2. Catalytic mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactors for methane 
utilization via different reactions
2.1 POM reaction
Syngas (a mixture of H2 and CO) is an essential building block for many value-
added chemicals which is usually converted from natural gas (CH4 as the main 
component) via two main reactions: partial oxidation of methane (POM) and steam 
reforming of methane (SRM). POM reaction is a slightly exothermic reaction as shown 
in Reaction (5). The products ratio (H2/CO) of POM reaction is around 2, which is 
suitable for Fischer‚ÄìTropsch (F‚ÄìT) synthesis to liquid fuel. However, POM requires 
tons of oxygen which is generally produced by costly and energy intensive cryogenic 
air separation or pressure swing adsorption process 1, 52. Conventionally, air can also be 
used as an oxygen source, but there are three problems in this process: (1) the separation 
process of downstream products is quite costly; (2) a large volume of N2 results in a 
decreased heating value of the entire process; (3) NOx pollutants are inevitably 
produced during this high temperature reaction.

Dense oxygen permeable MIEC membrane reactors with distinct advantages have 
attracted intense research interest for POM reactions. The requirement of oxygen for 
POM reaction is much more than other oxidative reactions. In addition, OSR and ODR 
reaction can be considered as the combination of POM reaction with SR and DR 
reactions. Hence, a large body of work has been devoted to the partial oxidation of 
methane (POM) in catalytic oxygen permeable MIEC membrane reactors as shown in 
Table 1 and 2. The catalytic membrane reactor with integration of catalysts and ceramic 
membranes showed much better performance as compared to the membrane alone

reactor without addition of catalysts54-56. In addition, the catalyst should be highly 
active and stable for POM reaction done at high temperature. The activity of catalysts 
could severely affect the performance of catalytic membrane reactors. For example, 
even though dual-phase membrane (e.g. Ce0.8Sm0.2O 2‚àíŒ¥-La0.8Sr0.2CrO3‚àíŒ¥) has good 
stability for oxygen permeation, the membrane integrated with perovskite type catalysts 
(e.g. La4Sr8Ti12O38-Œ¥ and SrTiO3) showed less conversion and activity as compared with 
Ni-based catalytic membrane reactors.57, 58 It should be noted that Ni-based catalysts 
require strong metal-support interaction to prevent Ni-metal agglomeration and 
maintain smaller particle size at high temperature, thereby maintaining high activity 
and stability, such as Ni-phyllosilicate type catalyst.59
To obtain an efficient catalytic oxygen permeable membrane reactor, it is 
necessary to fabricate high oxygen permeable membranes and active catalysts. The 
criterion of high performance membranes is high oxygen permeability and good 
stability under the complex gas mixture atmosphere in POM reaction. If the amount of 
catalyst is enough to completely convert the introduced CH4 in POM reaction, the 
oxygen permeation rate plays a dominant role in the reaction capacity of membrane 
reactors49. The ratio of CH4/O2 is ideally 2 for POM reaction, but a slight variation 
during the real reaction is required to optimize the conversion and selectivity. There is 
an optimum ratio of oxygen permeation flux to methane feeding rate to achieve high 
syngas yield. If the oxygen permeation flux is higher than this optimum ratio, the excess 
oxygen will lead to deep oxidation of methane and loss of H2 and CO selectivity. 
However, if the oxygen permeation flux is less than this optimum ratio, the methane 
conversion could decrease.
The stability of oxygen permeable membrane is another important factor for 
industrial applications during POM reaction. Since the main product from POM

reaction is syngas (H2 and CO) which are strong reducing gases. Hence, membranes 
should have capability to tolerate a certain concentration of reducing gas. Most MIEC 
materials cannot stand reducing atmosphere at high temperature due to the intrinsic 
property of solid oxides. These solid oxides powders could be reduced and decomposed 
under reducing gases atmosphere. However, once these oxygen conductive MIEC 
materials are fabricated to membranes, the behavior would be different from powders. 
During POM reaction, one side of membranes is exposed to air while another side is 
exposed to CH4 and syngas. If oxygen permeation rate through the membrane is fast, 
the high oxygen permeation rate through membranes can protect MIEC membranes 
from fracture under reducing gases. For example, BBCN membrane powders can be 
reduced by H2 at 500oC and by CO at 450oC as shown in Fig. 2a H2-TPR and Fig. 2b

For industrial applications, the productivity and stability are of primary 
consideration. Several remarkable catalytic membrane reactors have been reported and 
have shown excellent performance for POM reaction. At 950 oC, a U-shaped PLNCG 
hollow fiber membrane reactor with remarkable performance with O2 permeation of 
10.5 ml/min/cm2, CH4 conversion of 97%, CO selectivity of 99.5%, and stable 
operation for 140h have been achieved60. At 900 oC, SrFe0.8Nb0.2O3-Œ¥ multi-channel 
hollow fiber membrane reactor showed the best performance with CH4 conversion of 
94.6%, CO selectivity of 99%, O2 permeation of 19.2 cm3/min/cm2, H2 production of 
54.7 cm3/min/cm2 and stable operation for 120 h61. At 875 oC, BaCe0.1Co0.4Fe0.5O3‚àíŒ¥ 
disk membrane reactor showed that O2 permeation was 11.7 cm3/min/cm2, both CH4 
conversion and CO selectivity are above 97% and stable for 1000 h62. At 850 oC, a 
porous-dense dual layer disk membrane reactor with good conversion and selectivity 
showed stable performance for 1500 h operation63. The remarkable results reveal a

breakthrough improvement for potential industrial application. However, all of these 
studies are carried out at comparatively high temperature. To decrease the energy 
requirement and capital cost, some membrane reactors were studied at a medium-low 
temperature (800 oC and below). Recently, our group reported a BaBi0.05Co0.8Nb0.15O3-
Œ¥-Ni phyllosilicate catalytic hollow fiber membrane reactor for POM reaction at low 
temperature. This catalytic membrane reactor demonstrated a good catalytic-separation 
performance, achieving excellent hydrogen production rate of 33 ml/min/cm2, high 
oxygen permeation flux through BBCN membrane of 15 ml/min/cm2, CH4 conversion 
of 80% and CO selectivity of 85% under low temperature (730 oC) with low catalyst 
loading (20 mg) and high reactant feeding rate (
=25 ml/min). The performance was 
ùêπùê∂ùêª4
stable for 100 hours of operation 59.
Other than intrinsic property of membranes and catalysts, the design of catalytic 
membrane reactor also plays a significant role in the performance of membrane 
reactors64. Tan‚Äôs group investigated the design of membrane reactors by modeling of 
POM reaction via membrane reactors. The result shows that using the smaller 
membrane tubes is an effective way to reduce mass transfer resistance and achieve a 
higher reaction capacity, but the pressure drop is a problem to be considered. The 
maximum syngas yield can be estimated from their oxygen permeability49. In addition, 
the way of integrating catalyst with membrane is crucial which affects the performance 
of membrane reactors. Generally, three ways have been proposed to form catalytic 
membrane reactors for POM reactions. Firstly, packing catalysts on the membrane 
surface, this is the most popular way due to easy operation. Secondly, catalysts are 
coated on the membrane surface to form a thin catalysts layer. Lastly, a porous support 
contains Ni component as the catalyst for a dual layer membrane reactor which includes

a thin separation layer and a porous support substrate. For comparison of the three ways, 
coating catalyst on the membrane is not suggested since the thin catalyst layer is easily 
oxidized by permeated oxygen. Wang‚Äôs group investigated the different performance 
between coating and packing catalyst on the membrane, as shown in Fig. 4 54. These 
results show that by coating catalyst on the membrane surface, higher CH4 conversion 
is achieved at the cost of low CO selectivity65. This implies that the combustion of 
methane is a dominant reaction, because the permeated oxygen through the membrane 
easily oxidized the Ni coating layer on the membrane surface to form NiO which prefers 
deep oxidation rather than partial oxidation. Hence, a lot of CO2 is produced in this 
system where the catalyst is coated on hollow fiber membrane reactor. In terms of CO 
selectivity, packed catalysts on the membrane performed much better than coated 
catalysts. In conclusion, the mechanism of POM reaction in packed bed catalytic 
membrane reactors is as follows: a part of CH4 is completely oxidized to CO2 and H2O 
in the catalyst zone close to the membrane surface where the Ni-based catalyst is easily 
oxidized by permeate oxygen to NiO, while the rest of CH4 reacts with CO2 and H2O 
to occur reforming reaction to produce syngas in the catalyst zone far from the 
membrane, as shown in Fig. 5 54, 66. In addition, the position of the catalyst bed on the 
hollow fiber membrane significantly affects the performance. More catalyst behind the 
active zone of the membrane (Fig. 4 D) is better than the catalyst only covering the 
active zone of the membrane (Fig. 4 C) with higher conversion and selectivity, because 
more catalysts facilitate CH4 reforming with CO2 and H2O to produce syngas. The third 
way using porous support as catalysts has shown low catalytic activity, because the 
support and separation layer are generally co-sintered at high temperature which leads 
to low activity due to Ni-metal particles sintering 67, 68.

2.2 SRM reaction
Recently, different catalytic mixed conducting membrane reactors have been 
applied for steam reforming of methane (SRM) to H2 enriched syngas or purified H2. 
In terms of oxygen permeable MIEC ceramic membrane reactors, the permeated 
oxygen takes part in SRM reaction for partial oxidation of methane (POM). Then the 
reaction becomes oxidative steam reforming of methane (OSRM) as shown in Fig. 6 
(a). SRM reaction is a highly endothermic reaction (Reaction (6)) while POM reaction 
is an exothermic reaction (Reaction (5)). Hence, O2 permeable MIEC ceramic 
membrane reactor can minimize the energy requirement from traditional SR reaction 
even can perform auto-thermal reforming of methane 85. To apply oxygen permeable 
membrane for OSR reactions, the membrane should have a good oxygen permeability 
and stability under steam atmosphere. Several groups studied the performance of 
oxygen permeable perovskite membrane under steam atmosphere in terms of 
permeability and stability 86-89, which provide basic information for the design of 
catalytic membrane reactors for OSR reactions. Unlike POM reaction, in OSR reaction 
the CO selectivity, H2/CO ratio and heat of the reaction are profoundly affected by 
H2O/CH4 ratio and the temperature 90. Generally, the CO selectivity increases with 
increasing temperature since high temperature facilitates SRM (Reaction (6)) as well 
as reverse water gas shift reaction (H2+CO2‚ÜíCO +H2OŒîH (298K) = 41 kJ / mol) 
which can produce more CO product. However, the CO selectivity decreases with 
increasing the H2O/CH4 ratio due to the presence of excessive water, which facilitates 
water gas shift reaction (H2O+CO‚ÜíCO2 +H2 ŒîH (298K) = -41 kJ / mol). In contrast, 
H2 productivity shows an opposite trend to the CO selectivity with the change of 
temperature and H2O/CH4 ratio. Jin‚Äôs group reported a tubular Al2O3-doped

SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3‚àíŒ¥ membrane reactor for oxidative steam reforming of methane and 
showed a good performance. The H2/CO ratio in products could be tuned from1.9 to 
2.8 by varying the temperature or H2O/CH4 feeding ratio90. An auto-thermal reaction 
via catalytic membrane reactors can be achieved by carefully adjusting the temperature 
and H2O/CH4 ratio 85, 91, 92. The idealized condition is controlled based on the following 
reactions (5)-(7). 
CH4 + 1/2 O2 ‚Üí CO + 2H2    
ŒîH (298K) = -36 kJ / mol
(5)
CH4 + H2O ‚Üí CO + 3H2     
ŒîH (298K) = 206 kJ / mol
(6)
CO + H2O ‚Üí CO2 + H2      
ŒîH (298K) = -41 kJ / mol
(7)
In industries, steam reforming process is generally operated under pressure. 
Delbos‚Äôs group reported a catalytic La0.8Sr0.2Fe0.7Ga0.3O3‚àíŒ¥ membrane reactor for 
OSRM at the operating condition as close as possible to industrial requirements in terms 
of high pressure 93. The result shows that this membrane reactor was stable for more 
than 142 h without any fracture.CH4 conversion is around 74% and CO selectivity is 
around 50% at 900¬∞C with S/C=1 under pressure of 3 bar. In addition, the O2 
permeation through the membrane not only minimizes the energy requirement but also 
decreases carbon deposition on the catalyst for the heavy hydrocarbon reforming 
reaction. 
Hydrogen permeable and CO2 permeable dual-phase mixed conducting ceramic 
membrane reactors are also applicable for SRM reaction for purified H2 production. In 
H2 permeable MPEC ceramic membrane reactors, pure hydrogen can be extracted from 
the reaction system and the CH4 and steam conversion and H2 production can be 
improved due to simultaneous H2 removal from products as shown in Fig. 6 (b); In CO2 
permeable dual-phase mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactors, CO2 can be

simultaneous removed from the reaction system of steam enhanced methane reforming 
(reaction (6) and (7)), thus purified H2 is obtained and water-gas shift reaction (7) is 
promoted due to in situ CO2 removal as shown in Fig. 6 (c). Although both membrane 
reactors show attractive advantages to produce purified H2 by steam reforming of 
methane, the study of this application has seldom been reported. The possible reason is 
that these permeable membrane materials need to be stable enough to stand the harsh 
conditions 
of 
SRM 
reaction.

BaCe0.85Fe0.15O3‚àíŒ¥ - BaCe0.15Fe0.85O3‚àíŒ¥ (BCF8515-BCF1585) disk membrane reactor in 
SR reaction. The result showed that high purified H2 can be produced via the membrane 
reactor with 0.56 ~ 0.98 ml/min/cm2 as the temperature increased from 820 to 940 oC 
95. The membrane reactor can be stably operated in SRM reaction for 100 hours even 
though the membrane surface got partially reduced. The application of CO2 permeable 
dual-phase mixed conducting membrane reactor for SR reaction is reported by Lin‚Äôs 
group that Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-Œ¥ (SDC) / molten-carbonate dual-phase tubular membrane 
reactor could achieve 90% hydrogen yield with 84% CO2 recovery 96. Owing to in situ 
CO2 removal, high concentration H2 (~88 %) could be produced in a single-stage 
membrane reactor, and water-gas shift reaction (WGS) was remarkably enhanced. To 
further develop mixed conducting membrane reactor in SRM reaction, the stability of 
membrane materials under high reducing conditions (H2 enriched atmosphere) at high 
temperature needs to be improved.

2.3 DRM reaction
Dry (CO2) reforming of methane (DRM) is able to convert two main greenhouse 
gases (CO2 and CH4) to more valuable products (syngas). However, the main problems 
of DRM lie in its high energy requirements owing to its endothermic property (Reaction 
(8)) and high carbon deposition on the cheap and widely used Nickel based catalysts. 
Many researchers have explored novel Ni-based catalysts to improve the catalytic 
activity and stability for DRM reaction 98-125. The carbon residue on the catalysts can 
be minimized by decreasing and maintaining the Ni particle size via enhancing the 
metal support interaction106, 107, 112, 121, 126-128, doping with other elements to form 
bimetallic catalysts120, improving other properties such as basicity99 and oxygen 
mobility101, 103, designing structured catalysts such as core/yolk shell 104, 105, 111, 116, 129, 
130, perovskite101 and spinel structure102 and confining Ni nanoparticles within porous 
materials such as nanotubes, zeolites and ordered meso-porous structures114, 118. In 
addition, introducing small amount of oxygen into DRM reaction can facilitate the 
carbon removal and improve the catalysts stability. 
The application of catalytic oxygen permeable MIEC membrane reactor for 
oxidative dry reforming of methane (ODRM) reaction can tackle off the above 
problems since the permeated O2 introduces exothermic POM in the reaction and enable 
gasification of carbon to prevent carbon deposition on the catalyst 131, 132. Another 
important aspect to be considered for membrane synthesis for this type of reaction is its 
tolerance towards CO2. Many CO2 tolerant membrane materials have been successfully 
fabricated 56, 133-153.

Several groups have investigated catalytic membrane reactors for ODRM reaction 
131, 
132, 
154-157. Our group has recently published their findings of using 
La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Ni0.2O3-Œ¥ (LSCN) 156 and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Ga0.2O3-Œ¥ (LSCG) 157 based 
hollow fiber membrane configurations for the DRM reaction in the oxygen transport 
membrane reactor . Particularly, LSCG hollow fiber membrane reactor can maintain 
steady operation of DRM reaction for 160 h with high CH4 and CO2 conversions of ca. 
94% and 73% at 725 oC. The remarkable performance achieved presents the 
groundbreaking potential of oxygen permeable membrane reactor for oxidative DRM 
reaction. In fact, only a few studies have been dedicated to oxidative DRM reaction via 
oxygen permeable membrane reactor. For instance, BSCF membrane reactor which has 
been applied for ODRM reaction was only stable for a short period before displaying 
signs of deactivation due to the formation of barium carbonate 158. In addition, Jiang‚Äôs 
group reported a dual-phase catalytic membrane reactor for biogas reforming reaction 
and investigated the performance by adjusting CO2 concentration in the feeding gas 154. 
The result shows that the oxygen permeability and methane conversion increased by 
either raising the operating temperature or increasing the CO2 concentration. The 
benefits of utilizing oxygen permeable membrane reactors in terms of improved 
conversions as well as lower carbon deposition were adequately demonstrated in DRM 
reaction. The energy requirement and the conversion of CO2 and CH4 can be flexibly 
controlled by changing reaction parameters (feeding rate, CO2/CH4 ratio and 
temperature) of catalytic membrane reactors. 
To produce pure hydrogen, the H2 product from DRM reaction is separated from 
a mixture of H2 & CO using hydrogen permeable mixed conducting ceramic membrane 
reactors.

SrCe0.8Zr0.2O3-Œ¥ layer as the support and catalyst itself 159. The performance of this 
membrane reactor for DRM shows that CO2 conversion is increased by 10% and 30% 
at 900 ¬∞C for CH4/CO2 = 1/1 and CH4/CO2/H2O = 2/1/1 feed ratios, respectively, since 
simultaneous removal of H2 overcomes the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations of 
DRM reaction. It was also found that H2 production was improved by 15% and 18% at 
above conditions, respectively. However, the stability test was not reported in this study. 
Carbon residue on the catalyst is a major problem for DRM reaction. Moreover, 
simultaneous H2 removal from reaction system could aggravate this problem. Even 
though carbon residue could be reduced with increasing temperature (above 800oC), 
attempts should be made to reduce the reaction temperature of DRM to save energy and 
capital cost. Hence, a highly carbon-resistance catalyst is required for the catalytic H2 
permeable mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactor to apply in DRM reaction. In 
addition, membrane materials should be stable under CO2 atmosphere at high 
temperature.
Recently, a novel CO2 permeable dual-phase ceramic-carbonate membrane with 
the unique feature provides a potential application to construct a membrane reactor for 
high temperature reactions 97, 160, 161. Owing to high temperature CO2 permeability, the 
ceramic-carbonate dual phase membrane offers potential to integrate with catalysts to 
form a catalytic CO2 permeable mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactor for DRM 
reaction. Lin‚Äôs group proposed a modeling of CO2 permeable dual-phase membrane 
reactor for DRM reaction. The schematic diagram of the tubular membrane reactor 
consisting of a tubular ceramic-molten carbonate dual-phase membrane packed with 
Ni-based catalyst is shown in Fig. 7 162. High temperature CO2-containning flue gas is

fed into the shell side, and CH4 is fed into the tube side in which catalyst is packed. CO2 
permeates selectively through the membrane from the shell side to the tube side driven 
by the CO2 partial pressure difference. In the tube side, the on-going permeated CO2 
reacts with CH4 to produce syngas. Thus, the reactor couples the CO2 separation and 
DRM reaction into one bed, also the heat from the flue gas can be utilized directly 
through the membrane into the reaction system to provide energy for the endothermic 
DRM reaction. The simulation results show that the tube side CO2 pressure decreases 
and CO2 flux increases sharply when DRM reaction exists in the tube side. This work 
provides guidance for experimental study and application of CO2 permeable mixed 
conducting membrane reactors. Thereafter, Anderson and Lin firstly reported that the 
integration of LSCF-molten carbonate membrane with the catalyst to form the 
membrane reactor for DRM reaction. This membrane reactor showed CO2 permeation 
flux about 0.17 ml/ min/cm2 at 850 oC with an activation energy for permeation of about 
99.3 kJ/mol, meanwhile, the CO2 conversion as high as 88% was achieved163. 
Additionally, a simultaneous CO2 and O2 permeable triple-phase (Ce0.9Pr0.1O2-Œ¥-
Pr0.6Sr0.4Fe0.5Co0.5O3-Œ¥- molten carbonate) ceramic-carbonate membrane reactor was 
developed for ODRM reaction 164. In this reactor, CO2 and O2 was simultaneously 
permeated and reacted with CH4.  Overall 99% CH4 conversion and 6.25 ml/min/cm2 
syngas production rate was achieved. For practical application of catalytic CO2 
permeable mixed conducting membrane reactors, the match between the flue gas flow 
rate and the DRM reaction rate is very important to achieve the optimum separation 
and reaction efficiency.

2.4 OCM/NCM reaction
Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is a promising route to directly produce 
ethane and ethylene, a feedstock for synthesis of numerous value-added synthetic 
materials. However, for commercial exploitation, it is necessary to achieve a threshold 
of 30% C2 yield in the OCM reaction to ensure profitability. The main problem of OCM 
reaction is that the desired C2 products can be easily further oxidized to carbon oxides. 
The rate constant for COx formation from C2H4 combustion is up to six times greater 
than that from the direct combustion of CH4 165. Thus, the combustion of C2 products is 
also one of the main routes of COx formation with increasing methane conversion. 
Hence, it is difficult to obtain high conversion and selectivity at the same time.
Oxygen permeable MIEC membrane reactors have many advantages for OCM 
reaction, such as increasing selectivity, process intensification and reducing energy 
requirement. Since oxygen permeation through MIEC membranes is based on oxygen 
ion conduction, ionized oxygen can be delivered to the reaction compartment, which is 
highly selective for partial oxidation rather than combustion. Many groups investigated 
the application of oxygen permeable perovskite membrane reactors for OCM reaction 
as shown in Table 3 165-177. Tan‚Äôs group reported that LSCF perovskite powders have 
no selectivity for C2 production, but the blank LSCF membrane can achieve higher C2 
selectivity of 71.9% with CH4 conversion of 8% at 925oC. The CH4 conversion can be 
remarkably enhanced by integrating with SrTi0.9Li0.1O3 catalysts. The catalytic LSCF 
membrane reactor has obtained a maximum C2 yield of 21% with at 975oC166. Lin‚Äôs 
group could achieve C2 yield of 35% with selectivity of 54% at 900 oC via a tubular 
Bi1.5Y0.3Sm0.2O3‚àíŒ¥ (BYS) membrane reactor. This is a remarkable improvement for 
OCM reaction (C2 yield is above the threshold of 30% C2 yield for commercialization), 
but the feeding methane concentration was as low as 2%.

Recently, Li‚Äôs group developed a novel micro-structure hollow fiber membrane 
reactor for OCM reaction as shown in Fig. 8. This novel hollow fiber membrane 
consists of conical-shaped micro-channels at the inner surface and an outer dense 
oxygen separation layer. The membrane with this morphology can reduce mass transfer 
resistance for oxygen permeation, increase inner surface area of the membrane. The 
best result showed that a C2 yield of 39% with C2 selectivity of 79% was achieved by 
this novel membrane reactor at 900 oC. So far, this C2 yield is the highest value 
reported171.

OCM reaction has a heterogeneous-homogenous mechanism, wherein the 
formation of methane radical on the solid catalyst surface is a rate-controlling step. 
Methane reacts with the lattice oxygen of the oxide catalyst to form methane radicals 
(Reaction (9)). Then, methane radicals are coupled to form ethane in the gas phase 
(Reaction (10)), which is much faster than Reaction (9). In addition, ethane easily reacts 
with gas phase oxygen to form COx 174, 175. To increase the selectivity of C2 species, gas 
phase oxygen should be prevented in OCM reaction system.

Even though lattice oxygen is very important for the formation of methane radical, not 
all MIEC materials with high oxygen ion conductivity have catalytic activity for OCM 
reaction. For example, LSCF (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3‚àíŒ¥) and SCF SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3‚àíŒ¥ 
powders exhibit poor catalytic activity for OCM reaction178. The reason is that electron 
hole ( ) also plays an important role in Reaction (9). It is well known that the electronic 
‚Ñé.
conductivity of perovskite materials (such as LSCF and SCF) is dominated by electron 
conductivity (n-type) while that of some fluorite materials (such as BYS) is dominated 
by electron hole conductivity (P-type)173, 179. Hence, BYS not only has oxygen 
permeability but also has catalytic activity for OCM reaction, making a suitable 
material for catalytic MIEC membrane reactor for OCM reaction 172, 175-177, 180.
There are three designs of catalytic MIEC membrane reactors for OCM reaction 
as shown in Fig. 9. In the packed bed catalytic membrane reactor as shown in Fig. 9 
(a), the membrane function like oxygen distributor, and most of the reaction in the 
reactor involves gas phase oxygen. Only a small fraction of catalysts closely contacts 
the membrane, which has high selectivity for C2 molecules since ionized state oxygen 
play a dominant role in this area. Hence, C2 yield does not improve much compared 
with traditional co-feed packed bed catalytic reactor. Fig. 9 (b) shows the membrane 
reactor with a coating of catalyst on the surface. In this membrane reactor, the catalyst 
contact more uniformly with the membrane compared to the packed bed membrane 
reactor. Catalyst in close contact with the membrane can obtain ionized oxygen from 
the membrane to perform highly selective OCM reaction. However, gas phase oxygen 
cannot be completely prevented even in this membrane reactor design. Complete 
elimination of gas phase oxygen can be achieved by the third design as shown in Fig. 9

(c). In the third design, the membrane has both oxygen permeability and catalytic 
activity for OCM reaction, such as a BYS membrane. The entire surface of membrane 
functions as catalyst, which make it possible to utilize ionized oxygen only without gas 
phase oxygen if the reaction rate and permeation rate are carefully controlled and 
matched. 
To achieve the best performance (maximum C2 yield), the oxygen permeation flux 
and reaction rate must match each other. If the oxygen permeation is too high as 
compared to the reaction rate, the C2 yield could decrease. However, if the oxygen 
permeation is too low as compared to the reaction rate, the CH4 conversion could 
decrease. In addition, the stability of catalytic membrane reactor for OCM reaction is 
also important for industrial application, unfortunately most studies so far have not 
reported the long-term stability test. 
Fig. 9 Three designs of catalytic MIEC membrane reactors for OCM reaction
Beside the study of OCM reaction via oxygen permeable MIEC membrane 
reactors, non-oxidative coupling of methane (NCM) (Reaction (11)) can be carried out 
via H2 permeable MPEC membrane reactor to simultaneously remove hydrogen from 
NCM reaction. Only a few studies reported the application of H2 permeable membrane 
reactors for NCM reaction. Li‚Äôs group reported a SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3‚àíŒ¥ hollow fiber 
membrane without additional catalyst for NCM reaction181. The result shows that

simultaneously removing hydrogen from reaction system promotes the formation of 
ethylene and ethane. The maximum C2 yield of 13.4% can be achieved at 950oC. Due 
to the methane carbonization and the formation of higher hydrocarbons, the C2 
selectivity decreases with increasing temperature. There are several problems to be 
overcome in order to apply H2 permeable MPEC membrane reactor for NCM reaction. 
Firstly, the working temperature of H2 permeable MPEC membrane is too high to 
obtain appreciable C2 selectivity. Secondly, in-situ H2 removal can enhance CH4 
conversion but aggravate methane carbonization. Lastly, additional catalyst with good 
activity is required for this membrane reactor.

2.5 MA reaction
Recently, methane aromatization (MA) has attracted great interest since methane 
can be directly converted to aromatic hydrocarbons without any intermediate steps as 
show in Reaction (12). There are two major problems which hinders this process 
commercialization: (1) fast catalyst deactivation due to severe coking problem; (2) 
methane conversion is quite low as this reaction is limited by the thermodynamic 
equilibrium. For example, CH4 conversion of 12% and benzene yield of 4% can be 
expected at 700 oC 182, 183. 
6CH4 ‚Üî C6H6 + 9H2, ŒîH(298k) = +498.8 kJ/mol
(12)
To overcome the above problems, O2 or H2 permeable mixed conducting ceramic 
membrane reactors were applied for this reaction. For oxygen permeable MIEC ceramic 
membrane reactor, the reaction becomes oxidative methane aromatization (OMA) as 
shown in Reaction (13). O2 permeation has to be carefully controlled to avoid deep 
oxidation of products. In addition, Mo/HZSM-5 is the most developed catalyst for MA, 
where molybdenum carbide is the active catalyst essential for the formation of aromatic 
compounds. Excess oxygen could lead to oxidation of Mo2C, which favors POM or 
OCM reaction rather than MA reaction 184. Caro‚Äôs group first reported one oxygen 
permeable BSCF perovskite membrane reactor integrated with Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst 
for OMA reaction182. The result shows that methane conversion is enhanced via this 
membrane reactor, since MA is thermodynamically more favorable in the presence of 
oxygen. Furthermore, the permeated O2 reduces coking and stabilizes the performance 
of MA reaction, which shows that CH4 conversion and benzene selectivity via the 
membrane reactor was around 10% and 30% after 1000 mins reaction at 750oC, 
respectively. For comparison, CH4 conversion and benzene selectivity via traditional

fixed bed reactor only reached around 7% and 6% after 1000 mins at same condition. 
The sharp decrease of selectivity is mainly due to the coking on the catalyst. Meanwhile, 
it also proves that the catalyst still maintains MO2C as the active component for 
aromatization in this oxygen permeable MIEC ceramic membrane reactor. 
6CH4 + 4.5O2 ‚Üí C6H6 + 9H2O, ŒîH(298k) = -1677.6 kJ/mol  
(13)
Another solution to improve the productivity of MA reaction is utilization of H2 
permeable MPEC ceramic membrane reactors. Simultaneous H2 removal from MA 
reaction system can shift the thermodynamic equilibrium to products side. Caro‚Äôs group 
also reported this novel study183. In this study, a MPEC hollow fiber membrane 
(La5.5W0.6Mo0.4O11.25‚àíŒ¥) was integrated with Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst to form catalytic H2 
permeable MPEC ceramic membrane reactor for MA reaction as shown in Fig. 10. The 
results show that the starting yield of aromatics (benzene, toluene and naphthalene) in 
the membrane reactor can be increased by 47% (using CO2 as the sweep gas) to 70% 
(using argon as the sweep gas), in comparison with fixed bed reactor, because around 
50% H2 has been extracted from MA reaction system at 700oC, with a weight hourly 
space velocity (WHSV) of 840 cm3 gcat‚àí1 h‚àí1. These advantages of this membrane 
reactor decrease with time on stream since H2 abstraction enhance the coking on the 
catalyst. However, the catalyst performance can be regenerated via combustion in air. 
Even though the advantage of catalytic mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactors 
for OMA or MA is obvious, the aromatics yield is still too low to commercialize this 
process. It would take more research effort to further study catalysts as well as mixed 
conducting ceramic membrane reactor to enhance the valuable products yield.

2.6 Bi-functional membrane reactors
When two reactions are simultaneously carried out in one catalytic membrane 
reactor, it may be termed as a bi-functional membrane reactor. In the bi-functional 
membrane reactor, one reaction produces permeated gas (O2, H2 or CO2) and the other 
reaction consumes permeated gas (O2, H2 or CO2). By this way, the driving force of gas 
permeation is significantly increased due to high partial pressure gradient. In general, 
pressurization or vacuum operation was applied to create high partial pressure gradient 
for high gas permeation, but it is energy intensive and costly. The bi-functional 
membrane reactor not only can resolve the aforementioned problem but also 
concentrate two processes in one reactor to save the space of the reactor.
This novel design has mostly been applied for oxygen permeable mixed 
conducting ceramic membrane reactors. Generally, one oxygen producing reaction 
occurs (NOx decomposition, water splitting, CO2 decomposition, etc.) on one side of 
the membrane while one oxygen consuming reaction (POM, OSRM, ODRM, etc.) 
occurs on the other side of the membrane as shown in Fig. 11. By this way, the bi-
functional membrane reactors have three main advantages: (1) Both reactions are 
simultaneously carried out and can produce more valuable products and intensify the 
process; (2) Oxygen permeability through the membrane is enhanced owing to more 
driving force due to oxygen consumption reaction maintaining low oxygen partial 
pressure on one side of the membrane; (3) The conversion of oxygen producing reaction 
can be enhanced by simultaneous removal of O2 from the reaction system, which could 
help overcome the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation of the oxygen producing 
reaction. Several groups reported these novel bi-functional membrane reactors as 
shown in Table 4.

Caro‚Äôs group reported a catalytic BCFZ membrane reactor for simultaneous water 
splitting (WS) reaction (Reaction (14)) and POM reaction (Reaction (5)). The results 
show that H2 production from water splitting reaction (WS) was dramatically enhanced 
by combining with POM reaction in one membrane reactor. The hydrogen production 
rate was 3.1 and 2.3 ml/min/cm2 swept by CH4 at 950¬∞C and 900¬∞C, respectively, while 
was only 0.026 ml/min/cm2 at 900¬∞C swept by He. The hydrogen production rate 
increased with increasing temperature, and also by increasing the methane 
concentration due to a higher oxygen partial pressure gradient across the membrane. 
186. In the other model, air and steam were co-fed to produce ammonia synthesis gas 
(H2&N2) by WS and air separation on the one side of the membrane reactor, while 
common syngas (H2&CO) by POM reaction was co-produced on the other side of the

membrane reactor 187, 188. Compared with traditional industrial processes to produce 
two kinds of syngas, the energy consumption via membrane reactor can be decreased 
by around 66.5%. These excellent achievement and progress via this novel bi-functional 
membrane reactor is obvious, but the operating temperature is still too high for 
industrial application.  
NOx decomposition (Reaction (15)) is one efficient method for DeNOx treatment, 
and it can be the source of oxygen for the other reaction (oxygen consuming reaction) 
in the bi-functional membrane reactor. Caro and Jiang‚Äôs group reported several studies 
on this bi-functional membrane reactor system for DeNOx and oxidative methane 
reforming. For example, NO decomposition and POM was operated in the membrane 
reactor and showed a complete conversion of NO to N2 at 875¬∞C with N2 yield of 95%, 
and the NOX decomposition was greatly enhanced by coupling with POM reaction 189. 
Moreover, N2O decomposition and ODRM was coupled in a membrane reactor and 
showed higher conversion of both CH4 and N2O owing to CO2 participating in the CH4 
reforming reaction 190. All the above reactions were operated at a temperature of 875 
¬∞C and higher. To save the energy consumption and decrease the capital cost for these 
membrane reactor system, our group developed low temperature bi-functional 
membrane reactor for NO decomposition and POM reaction and showed an almost 
complete NO conversion at 675 ¬∞C185.

The design of coupling two reactions in one membrane reactor also can be applied 
for H2 and CO2 permeable mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactors. However, 
very few studies have reported this kind of work so far. Recently, Liu‚Äôs group reported 
H2 permeable SrCe0.7Zr0.2Eu0.1O3-Œ¥ membrane reactor for simultaneous NCM reaction

(Reaction (11)) and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reactions. However, the extreme 
high operating temperature (Ôπ•1000¬∞C) limited their performance.
Theoretically, the design of bi-functional membrane reactors can be widely 
applied for all O2, H2 and CO2 permeable membrane reactors as long as one reaction 
produces permeated gas and the other reaction consumes permeated gas to create a high 
driving force for gas permeation. However, several considerations are necessary for 
successfully coupling two reactions in one membrane reactor: (1) the operating 
temperature zone for two reactions could be close to each other; (2) membrane materials 
could be able to withstand complex gas conditions for the two reactions; (3) it is better 
to couple one endothermic and one exothermic reactions in one membrane reactor for 
energy efficiency and preventing hotspot or cold spot formations along the membrane 
reactor.

General problems and outlooks of mixed conducting membrane 
reactors
Although there are breakthrough progresses in the development of 
catalytic membrane reactors, the commercialization of such systems have not 
yet been realized. There are still many issues to be addressed to meet the 
requirement of industrial applications. The current challenges and the directions 
for development of mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactors in the future 
are discussed in this section.
3.1 The effect of reactions on permeability through mixed conducting 
membranes
The permeability through mixed conducting membranes during a reaction 
will be much different from the one without reaction. It is well known that 
oxygen permeation through O2 permeable MIEC membranes will be severely 
increased under reaction conditions with a specific reducing gas. However, 
most studies only concluded this phenomenon without providing quantitative 
analysis. For oxygen permeable MIEC membrane under reaction conditions, it 
is difficult to detect the oxygen partial pressure on the reaction side (
). But 
ùëÉ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ùëÇ2
this value can be estimated by the equilibrium constant of this reaction (KT) at 
certain temperature. For example, in POM reaction with a fast reaction rate, it 
may be assumed that equilibrium is reached at the reaction side without side 
reactions. Then, the oxygen partial pressure in the reaction side (
) can be 
ùëÉ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ùëÇ2
calculated based on (KT) in Reaction (5) at temperature T as shown below:

Under the assumption that the air flow rate on the other side of membranes 
is high enough to maintain a constant oxygen concentration (
), the 
ùëÉ‚Ä≤ùëÇ2
maximum driving force for oxygen permeation under the reaction can be 
expected as (

extremely fast reaction rate where reaction equilibrium is achieved. In the real 
case, the reaction may not be fast enough to reach the equilibrium, which 
strongly depends on the reaction rate, catalyst activity and reactant feeding rate. 
For example, the oxygen permeation flux through BYS membrane under 
reaction conditions with ethane is about one order of magnitude higher than that 
with methane because of significantly faster oxidation reaction of ethane, which 
can thereby almost completely consume the permeated oxygen196. To improve 
the model of permeation under reactions, a finite reaction rate model was 
introduced into the calculation by Lin‚Äôs group as shown below, which can be 
used for quantitative analysis for the oxygen permeation through MIEC 
membranes under reactions197. 
For p-type mixed conducting membrane with representation of

To illustrate the effect of the reaction on permeation rate, a simple reaction 
(CO oxidation) in a simple continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was 
modeled. The reaction rate can be correlated to the oxygen partial pressure in 
the reaction side (

literature197. Based on mass balance in the membrane reactor, the model 
solution can be achieved. The results showed that the increase in reaction rate 
caused the transition of oxygen permeation mechanism from p-type to n-type, 
which remarkably increase oxygen permeation by up to 30 times. Based on 
above discussion, it is obvious that the gas permeation through mixed 
conducting membrane could be significantly improved (one magnitude higher) 
when coupled with a catalytic reaction. Hence, the reactant feeding rate into the 
membrane reactor has to be carefully controlled to synchronize with the 
permeation rate, thereby preventing membrane fracture or deep combustion. 
Additionally, it is important to design an economic catalytic mixed 
conducting membrane reactor by balancing catalyst amount and membrane area. 
The product yield of the membrane reactor is mostly decided by the catalyst 
amount, reactant feed rate and permeation rate at certain temperature. For 
example, oxygen permeable membrane reactor for POM reaction, the syngas 
yield can be increased by the increase of the catalyst loading amount due to high 
capacity of methane conversion but is also limited by the oxygen permeation 
amount which is decided by the membrane area.  Generally, non-noble metal

(Ni, Fe, Co etc.) catalyst is widely used for reforming reaction with cheaper cost 
compared with mixed conducting membrane. In this case, it suggests that the 
catalyst loading amount in the membrane reactor could be excess to achieve a 
high yield based on the maximum permeation through the membrane. However, 
if the catalyst is noble metal or other higher cost catalyst compared with mixed 
conducting membranes, then the membrane area should be provided excess to 
achieve a maximum yield based on the amount of the catalyst.
3.2 Chemical stability
It is necessary to develop more stable and reliable membrane materials to 
withstand harsh gas atmosphere at high temperature during long-term reactions. 
Demixing and decomposition were found on perovskite membranes after long-
term separation test. For example, Co and Fe enrichment as well as La depletion 
was found on the surface and in the bulk at the air side of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-Œ¥ 
membranes after long-term oxygen separation test (up to 5512 h). Even though 
oxygen permeability of LSCF membranes was not affected by the demixing and 
decomposition after 5512 h, it is expected to be affected by more severe change 
on the membrane after longer operation times198. However, the kinetic demixing 
and decomposition could be inhibited by A-site atom excessive perovskite 
materials to increase the membrane stability. 
The mixed conducting membrane in membrane reactors is subjected to 
more harsh condition than in only separation applications. Generally, 
membranes are exposed to highly reducible gases (H2, CO, CH4 and so on), 
steam, CO2 and some impurity gas (such as sulfur compounds)41, 199. The 
membrane materials should be stable and maintain its phase structure upon

exposure to such gas atmosphere at high temperature. Especially, CO2-tolerant 
perovskite materials have attracted more attention in recent years. Barium and 
cobalt enriched perovskite materials generally have high oxygen permeability 
but cannot maintain a stable performance during long-term reactions, because 
barium easily reacts with CO2 to form barium carbonate which is very stable 
and difficult to decompose, cobalt enrichment can decrease electronegativity to 
enhance the basicity of perovskite materials which leads to easier reaction with 
CO2. Hence, to obtain a stable membrane reactor, high barium and cobalt 
doping ratio in perovskite materials are not suggested for long-term reaction in 
the industrial applications. Syngas (H2 and CO) produced from methane 
reforming reaction is highly reducing in nature, and even though fast oxygen 
permeation rate can protect the bulk of oxygen permeable MIEC membrane, the 
membrane surface exposed to the reaction side is inevitably reduced by syngas. 
A slight reduction ( when a small amount of perovskite oxides on the membrane 
surface were reduced) could increase membrane surface area due to roughness 
of membrane surface, which could increase oxygen permeation due to the 
enhancement of surface exchange reaction on the membrane surface59. 
However, significant reduction (when most of perovskite oxides on the 
membrane surface were reduced to mixed oxides) causes the failure of oxygen 
conductivity on the membrane surface, which leads to a decrease of oxygen 
permeation due to the limitation of surface exchange reaction on the membrane 
surface 11, 200, 201.
Common catalysts for POM, OSR, ODR and WGS reactions are metal-
based catalysts. mixed conducting oxides materials have no catalytic activity 
for above reactions. In this case, a suitable catalyst is indispensable to integrate

with the membrane to achieve high catalytic performance for above reactions. 
On the other hand, some MIEC oxides materials have good catalytic activity for 
OCM reaction. Hence, MIEC membrane alone functions as both oxygen 
permeable membrane and active catalysts. In addition, the catalyst materials 
must be compatible with membrane materials. For example, there are 
possibilities that one element from catalyst may fuse into membrane material 
due to solid state reaction, forming a separate phase. In this case, an inert porous 
separation layer is required to avoid the direct contact between membranes and 
catalysts if both can react each at high temperature. This design is reported by 
Caro‚Äôs group for oxidative propane dehydrogenation and achieved a stable 
catalytic membrane reactor with good mechanical strength due to the protection 
of porous alumina tube. However, this design increases the capital and 
manufacturing cost, and it cannot utilize ionic oxygen from the membrane 
surface, which may be only used for the membrane with low chemical stability 
and weak mechanical property 202.
Additionally, mixed conducting ceramic membranes undergo obvious 
chemical expansion at high temperatures due to the formation of oxygen 
vacancies which could be affected by oxygen partial pressure and temperatures. 
The spatial dilation of mixed conducting materials is associated with a gradual 
increase in lattice parameter upon the change in oxygen non-stoichiometry (Œ¥), 
which is commonly defined as chemical expansion. For example, the oxygen 
non-stoichiometry (Œ¥) of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.4Fe0.6O3-Œ¥ perovskite materials could 
change based on oxygen partial pressure at high temperatures203. At high 
temperatures, Co and Fe tend to undergo thermal reduction from high valence 
to low valence associated with the increase in non-stoichiometry (Œ¥), which

leads to the spatial expansion of the BSCF membrane. When the membrane is 
placed under high oxygen partial pressure gradient, such as under POM reaction, 
the oxygen vacancy (related to Œ¥) concentration on both sides of the membrane 
is significantly different which leads to different extent of chemical 
expansion204. Therefore, the membrane is subjected to chemical induced stress 
which causes the fracture of the membrane205. However, reducing membrane 
thickness could lower the chemical induced stress to maintain the membrane 
stability206.
3.3 High temperature sealing technique
High temperature sealing technique has been hindering the practical 
application of mixed conducting ceramic membranes and membrane reactors. 
The sealant has to withstand high temperatures (600oC and above) and keep the 
membrane system gas tight. Furthermore, due to the obvious chemical 
expansion of mixed conducting membranes under high-temperature operation, 
the high temperature sealants are required to have similar expansion coefficient 
as that of mixed conducting ceramic membranes or to be flexibility at high 
temperatures. Otherwise, it will lead to the fracture of membranes. For most 
lab-scale study on mixed conducting hollow fiber membrane reactors, the 
sealant is kept out of heating zone 59, 149, 156, 207. In this case, the temperature of 
joint part is controlled around 300~350oC and below, high temperature silicon 
sealant can be applied for this design of hollow fiber membrane reactors. 
However, it leads to incomplete utilization of mixed conducting membranes 
because part of membranes is out of heating zone and does not play a role in 
permeation. To increase the efficiency of membrane utilization, the join part

56
should be closer to heating zone if the sealant can stand high temperature and 
match the thermal expansion coefficient of membranes. Several high 
temperature sealants have been applied in the lab-scale study. For example, 
silver, golden paste or rings are most commonly applied for high temperature 
sealing in mixed conducting membrane reactors 54, 67, 208. High temperature pre-
treatment (around 900-950oC) is necessary for this sealant to make it dense 
before the application. However, this technique is quite expensive and 
membranes are easily cracked during cooling down because of the different 
thermal coefficient between metal and ceramics. Another type is ceramic-glass 
sealant. The composition of ceramic-glass sealant is not fixed, which should be 
adjusted based on the thermal expansion coefficient of different mixed 
conducting membrane materials. This sealant also requires a high temperature 
pre-treatment based on the melting and softening point of different ceramic-
glasses 174, 175. In addition, ceramic-glass sealant should be inert without severe 
reaction with membrane material at high temperature. Lastly, graphite ring can 
also be used as a sealant, but can only be applied in non-oxidative atmosphere. 
Hence, it is only suitable for H2 permeable mixed conducting membrane 
reactors and not in O2 permeable mixed conducting membrane reactors. 
However, the mechanical strength of mixed conducting membranes should be 
enough to stand the twisting force during assembling membrane reactors, 
especially for hollow fiber membrane reactors. Even though, the above high 
temperature sealants have been mentioned in the experimental study of 
literatures, few researchers particularly investigated the high temperature 
sealing for mixed conducting membranes. Lin‚Äôs group have reported that the 
ceramic-glass composite seal can be tailored to obtain suitable wettability,

viscosity, chemical inertness, thermal expansibility and bonding strength for a 
number of different mixed conducting membranes209. Gallucci‚Äôs group 
investigated and compared different high temperature sealants, such as glass 
powder, ceramic paste and gold paste. An optimized sealing technique 
consisting of an inert gold layer and the glass sealant has shown the best 
performance for high temperature sealing210. For future industrial application, 
the high temperature sealing is very critical and should be further improved to 
enhance the stability of membrane reactor and simplify the operation process.
3.4  The configuration and mechanical stability of mixed conducting 
membrane reactors
The configuration of catalytic membrane reactors should be considered for 
industrial applications. There are three main types of configurations, namely, 
plate (or planar), tubular and hollow fibers. Planar membrane module can be 
fabricated on a large scale and are used by industries (Air Products and 
Ceramatec). Planar design can provide a large membrane area but their 
development and application are still constrained by the high-temperature 
sealing problem 211. Tubular membranes can avoid high-temperature sealing 
problem since the sealing part can be put outside of the heating zone. However, 
the tubular configuration provides a low packing density. The configuration of 
hollow fiber membrane exhibits both advantages of planar and tubular 
membranes such as higher surface area/volume ratio, avoidance of high-
temperature sealing and higher permeation flux 7, 55, 207, 212-220. For example, our

high flux of 14.08 ml/min/cm2 due to much smaller membrane thickness217. In 
addition, hollow fiber membranes using the phase inversion technique can 
significantly increase the membrane area by using same amount of membrane 
materials, which leads to reduce membrane cost. Furthermore, it was reported 
that hollow fiber membrane with thin membrane thickness could reduce 
chemically induced stress to prevent cracking of membranes206.
However, for the hollow fiber membrane configuration, constraints are 
imposed by high gas velocities resulting in pressure drop over the membrane 
and the low mechanical strength of hollow fiber membrane limiting industrial 
application. Recently, several groups are improving the configuration of 
perovskite hollow fiber membranes to resolve the above problems. Liu and 
Tan‚Äôs group simultaneously improved the mechanical strength and oxygen 
permeation flux of the individual perovskite hollow fiber membranes by 
bundling strategy as shown in Fig. 12. The application of porous 
Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.4Fe0.6O3-Œ¥ perovskite as the binder not only plays the function of 
binding to increase the mechanical strength but also works as the catalyst 
attached on the exterior of the hollow fiber to improve the oxygen permeation 
flux 221. Jin‚Äôs group reported multi-channel perovskite hollow fiber membranes 
as shown in Fig. 13 (a) and (b). The results show that the mechanical strength 
of the 4-channel and 19-channel perovskite hollow fiber membrane was 6~60 
times that of single perovskite hollow fiber membrane, and the oxygen 
permeation flux was about two times that of single channel hollow fiber 
membranes at similar conditions 222, 223. Li‚Äôs group further studied the 
morphology, performance and stability of multi-channel (3, 4, 7-channels) 
perovskite hollow fiber membranes as shown in Fig. 13 (c). The bending force

to break these multi-channel membranes are 10.4, 13.5, 15.4 and 11.7 N for the 
3-channel, 4-channel, 7-channel-DMSO and 7-channel-NMP membranes with 
3cm length, respectively, which are much higher than that of single hollow fiber 
membranes. The oxygen permeation through multi-channel hollow fiber 
membranes is similar to that through the typical sandwich-like structured single 
hollow fiber membrane at temperatures below 900 ¬∞C, but is remarkably higher 
at higher temperatures due to their thinner membrane walls. It is noteworthy 
that multi-channel hollow fiber membrane can enhance mechanical strength and 
oxygen permeation but they sacrifice the packing density. For example, the 
packing density of the single channel hollow fiber membrane is around ~3000 
m2/m3 while that of the 19-channel hollow fiber membrane is around ~800 
m2/m3 223. The trade-off relationship between the packing density and 
mechanical strength has to be considered in the future industrial applications.

3.5 Heat management and industrial development
In the real industrial application, heat management of mixed conducting 
ceramic membrane reactors is a significant issue to be addressed for stable 
production and saving energy because all reactions are either endothermic or 
exothermic. For example, POM is a typical exothermic reaction. In a large scale 
mixed conducting membrane reactor, the heat could accumulate from upstream 
to downstream, which lead to temperature gradient along the stream direction 
resulting in the breaking of mixed conducting ceramic membranes. Hence, a 
heat exchanger has to be combined in the ceramic membrane reactors. The 
design of heat exchanger in the traditional packed bed reactor is a mature 
technique, but few studies have reported the design of heat exchanger in ceramic 
membrane reactors. Air Products and Ceramatec have reported this issue in the 
application of large scale mixed conducting membrane reactors with planar 
geometry. They also mentioned that planar compact heat exchanger can achieve 
higher convective heat transfer coefficients than tube heat exchanger since the 
heat transfer coefficients are inversely proportional to the hydraulic diameter.

In this case, the design of efficient heat exchanger for tubular and hollow fiber 
membrane is a big challenge for industrial application. 
Recently, a breakthrough improvement for the application of oxygen 
mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactor in the industrial application has 
been reported by Air Products and Ceramatec 211, 225. They demonstrated a 
significant scale mixed conducting ceramic membrane unit for oxygen and 
syngas production with the capacity to produce up to 100 tons/day oxygen and 
over 15000 hours lifetime. In term of syngas production via mixed conducting 
membrane reactors, it is suggested to use high pressure natural gas feed with 
low pressure air achieve the best economics. These results inspire researchers 
to make more efforts to commercialize mixed conducting ceramic membrane 
reactors for industrial application. Additionally, in terms of bi-functional 
membrane reactor, the best choice is to couple one endothermic reaction with 
another exothermic reaction in one membrane reactor to balance the energy 
requirement also can resolve the heat exchange problems. But the reaction rates 
of both side reactions have to be carefully controlled to achieve best 
performance as well as heat management.

Conclusions
This review comprehensively discusses the progress made and challenges 
in the development of catalytic O2, H2 and CO2 permeable mixed conducting 
ceramic membrane reactors for methane conversion. From the overview, it can 
be concluded that the performance of these catalytic membrane reactors depend 
on both permeability of the membrane and catalytic activity of the catalyst.

Meanwhile, reactant inlet flow rate should be carefully regulated according to 
the amount of permeance from membrane to achieve maximum yield of 
valuable products. Few key mechanisms of application of catalytic mixed 
conducting ceramic membrane reactors are discussed and proposed, which 
provide a guideline for the design of membrane reactors. Although there are 
breakthrough progresses in the development of catalytic membrane reactors, 
commercialization of such systems has not yet been realized. There are still 
many issues to be addressed in order to meet the requirement of industrial 
applications, such as chemical and mechanical stability of mixed conducting 
membranes, high temperature sealing technique, and the optimization of 
membrane reactors design and heat management. Moreover, mixed conducting 
membranes cost has to be decreased, which depends on the cost of raw materials, 
synthesis method of membrane materials, fabrication method of membranes and 
products qualification ratio. Currently, the development of catalytic mixed 
conducting ceramic membrane reactors is highly promising, and there is need 
to put more efforts to overcome the challenges and make a pathway for its 
commercialization in the near future.
