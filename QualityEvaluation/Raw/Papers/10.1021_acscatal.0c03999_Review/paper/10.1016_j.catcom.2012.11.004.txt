A series of mesoporous β-Ga2O3 with high surface area have been prepared using eco-friendly sucrose as a
non-surfactant template and studied in relation to their performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to
propylene in the presence of CO2. Among the four sucrose-derived samples tested, the material prepared
from a sucrose/Ga2O3 molar ratio of 4 achieved the highest propane conversion, which was approximately
the double efﬁciency of the conventional β-Ga2O3. The enhanced activity of the sucrose-derived materials
is attributed to a high abundance of coordinative unsaturated surface Ga sites as a consequence of their favor-
able textural properties and enhanced surface areas.

1. Introduction
Direct conversion of light alkanes to value-added oleﬁns by on-
purpose oleﬁn technologies may become a potentially economically via-
ble route in the coming years [1]. In this connection, much recent atten-
tion has been directed to the CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation
(PDH), which is a potentially attractive alternative approach to produce
propylene, an important monomeric feedstock in the chemical industry
[2,3]. In this valuable transformation, cheap and abundant CO2 serves
two distinct functions: as a mild oxidant to shift the equilibrium towards
the products and the suppression of coke deposition [4,5]. Whereas a
number of catalysts have been developed for such purpose, a persistent
challenge is the control of reaction kinetics to avoid rapid deactivation
owing to coke formation [6]. Thus far, gallium oxides have been recog-
nized as one kind of the most promising materials due to their excellent
catalytic efﬁciency as compared to conventional Cr- or V-based systems
[7,8]. The superior performance of the Ga2O3-based system for PDH has
been attributed to the unique structural characteristics of coordinatively
unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites [9], which is believed to be crucial
for hydrocarbon activation in CO2 atmosphere [10]. However, the devel-
opment of new improved catalytic system exhibiting desirable stability
and activity continues to be a major challenge.
Over the years, a number of studies have established that the popula-
tion of the catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is a strong function of the
surface area of Ga2O3 among different Ga2O3 polymorphs [10–12]. In this
sense, one may rationalize that simply increasing the surface area of
Ga2O3 can lead to an improvement in the PDH activity. There were how-
ever, only very few studies on the synthesis of Ga2O3 with enhanced sur-
face area. In a recent study by West et al. [13], mesoporous Ga2O3 with a
surface area up to 307 m2 g−1 has been synthesized via a nanocasting
technique using mesoporous carbon (CMK) as a hard template. The prob-
lems inherent in this procedure are that it is extremely tedious and
time-consuming. A urea-based hydrothermal method using polyethylene
glycol (PEG) as the soft template agent has been employed for prepara-
tion of a series of mesoporous β-Ga2O3 nonorods, which however can
only afford a very limited accessible surface area of ca. 29 m2 g−1 [14].
Alternatively, sucrose is a kind of water soluble carbon source, which
has been widely employed as a simple and convenient carbon template
precursor in synthesis of high surface area α-Al2O3 [15,16] and ZrO2
[17]. Herein, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that, high surface area
mesoporous β-Ga2O3 materials prepared using eco-friendly sucrose as a
non-surfactant template show a signiﬁcantly improved performance for
catalyzing propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
An appropriate amount of sucrose was dissolved in 0.25 M aqueous
Ga(NO3)3 solution at 303 K under continuous stirring. The pH of the so-
lution was adjusted to ca. 5 by dropwise adding of 3 M ammonia solu-
tion. After aging at 353 K for 2 h, the resulting material was oven dried
at 383 K for 24 h. The thus-obtained black precursor (2 g) was then
transferred into a tube furnace and was initially annealed under N2
(30 mL min−1) at 923 K for 30 min, followed by calcination at 923 K

under ﬂowing air (10 mL min−1) for 4 h. Four sucrose-templated sam-
ples with sucrose/Ga2O3 molar ratio at 1, 2, 4, and 8 were synthesized,
denoted as β-Ga2O3-S1, β-Ga2O3-S2, β-Ga2O3-S4, and β-Ga2O3-S8, re-
spectively. For comparison purpose, a conventional β-Ga2O3 sample
was prepared by calcination of gallium nitrate at 923 K for 4 h [18].
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The BET speciﬁc surface areas of the samples were determined by
adsorption–desorption of nitrogen at 77 K using a Micromeritics TriStar
3000 equipment. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements of
the catalysts were carried out on a Germany Bruker D8Advance X-ray dif-
fractometer using nickel ﬁltered Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA.
The acidic property of each catalyst was characterized by ammonia
temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). NH3 was adsorbed at
393 K after pre-treatment at 773 K in an He stream. The desorbed NH3
in ﬂowing He gas was quantiﬁed (NH2 fragment of mass number 16)
by mass spectroscopy (Balzers OmniStar QMS 200). The morphology
and microstructure were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, Philips XL 30) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM,
JEOL-2011, operated at 200 kV).
2.3. Activity measurement
Catalytic tests were performed in a ﬁxed-bed ﬂow microreactor at
atmospheric pressure, and the catalyst load was 200 mg. Prior to the re-
action, the catalysts were pretreated at 773 K for 1 h in N2 ﬂow. The feed
was at a total ﬂow rate of 10 mL min−1 containing 2.5 vol.% propane,
5 vol.% CO2, and a balance of N2. The hydrocarbon reaction products
were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (Type GC-122,
Shanghai) equipped with a 6-m packed column of Porapak Q and a
ﬂame ionization detector (FID). The permanent gaseous products, in-
cluding N2, CO, and CO2, were analyzed on-line by another GC equipped
with a TDX-01 column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
3. Results and discussion
It is known that gallium oxide has ﬁve different polymorphs (α-, β-,
γ-, δ-, and ε-Ga2O3), among which β-Ga2O3 can be obtained by heating
any other form of Ga2O3 or gallium hydrates in air with temperature
above 1173 K [19]. The diffraction proﬁles for the sucrose-derived
Ga2O3 samples along with conventional β-Ga2O3 are shown in Fig. 1.

observed for all samples, demonstrating that the most stable form of
Ga2O3 was achieved via the sucrose-template synthesis. The sucrose-
derived β-Ga2O3 samples show obviously lower crystallinity, as reﬂected
from their broadened peaks and decreased diffraction signals relative to
that for conventional β-Ga2O3. In general, the crystallinity for the ﬁve
samples decreased in the following order: β-Ga2O3>β-Ga2O3-S1>
β-Ga2O3-S2>β-Ga2O3-S4>β-Ga2O3-S8.
The corresponding nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and
pore size distributions of the Ga2O3 samples are presented in Fig. 2. All
samples show typical type IV isotherms characteristic of mesoporous
structures, among which H3 [20] and H1 [21] hysteresis loops were re-
spectively identiﬁed for conventional β-Ga2O3 and the sucrose-derived
samples. As summarized in Table 1, the sucrose-templating approach
can afford the production of a series of mesoporous samples with favor-
able textural properties and enhanced surface areas. The fact that the
resultant materials are pure white in color suggests a complete tem-
plate removal during the calcination step, as conﬁrmed from the
thermogravimetry analysis (Fig S3). The SEM images of conventional

β-Ga2O3 and sucrose-derived samples are shown in Fig. 3. It is observed
that conventional β-Ga2O3 presents a solid bulk structure, while the
sucrose-templated samples display distinct sponge-like morphology, a
feature probably as a result of the carbon template removal during com-
bustion processing. Note that the sample prepared with higher sucrose/
Ga2O3 ratio possesses higher porosity. Moreover, the TEM analysis re-
veals a much smaller average particle size of β-Ga2O3-S4 (Fig. 3g) rela-
tive to that of the conventional β-Ga2O3 (Fig. 3f), in line with the
microstructural crystallinity as reﬂected from the XRD measurements.
Surface acidity of these Ga2O3 samples was measured by NH3-TPD
experiments. A broad asymmetric NH3 desorption peak is registered
in the TPD proﬁles for all ﬁve samples as shown in Fig. S1, consistent
with the results observed by Zheng et al. [18]. The peak temperatures
of the ﬁve samples are all located within 560–575 K, indicating the
presence of only marginal variation in the acid strength for all sam-
ples. Nonetheless, there is a signiﬁcant difference in the total amounts
of the surface acidity between the two types of β-Ga2O3 samples. Spe-
ciﬁcally, the total acidity of the four sucrose-derived samples is ap-
proximately 1–2 times higher than that of the conventional β-Ga2O3
(Table 1). Previous studies on the surface property of β-Ga2O3 have
revealed that the Lewis acid centers comprise mainly the structurally
defective Ga sites characteristics of (cus) nature [9,22]. Thus, it fol-
lows that the remarkably increased acid sites of the sucrose-derived
samples can be largely attributed to a higher density of surface de-
fects as a consequence of the decreased crystallinity and structural
modiﬁcation as inferred from XRD and TEM studies.
The dehydrogenation of propane over the β-Ga2O3 samples in the
presence of CO2 was investigated at 773 K, and the catalytic activity
and product selectivity data were shown in Fig. 4. The major product
formed in the reaction is propylene, with the minor products being eth-
ane, ethylene and methane. During the 8 h run, the selectivities of pro-
pylene remain above 86% for the ﬁve catalysts (Fig. 4), among which
slightly higher values were achieved over the templated samples. It is in-
teresting to note that the sucrose-derived samples gave consistently
higher propane conversion during the reaction, showing that the textur-
al properties of the β-Ga2O3 materials play a signiﬁcant role in the titled
reaction. Worth mentioning is that over β-Ga2O3-S4 with the highest
speciﬁc surface area, a conversion of propane (43.7%) approximately
twice that of conventional β-Ga2O3 (23.8%) can be achieved. As far as
we are aware, this value compared favorably with the exceptionally
high activity obtained with the Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions [23]. It is
also found that the catalytic performance show an excellent correlation
with the surface acidity data (Fig. S2). Therefore, in line with the broad
literature documenting the PDH reaction over Ga-based materials, it ap-
pears that a high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is the key fac-
tor in achieving high catalytic activity of sucrose-derived Ga2O3 catalysts
[11,22].
As far as the stability is concerned, after 8 h run, conventional β-Ga2O3
lost 79% of its initial activity, while the sucrose-templated samples show
conversion loss corresponding to 43–56% of their initial values. This re-
veals another attractive advantage of the sucrose-templated samples for
prolonging the lifetime of β-Ga2O3 catalyst. However, deactivation is
still severe for the sucrose-templated samples, and regeneration therefore
seems indispensable from the perspective of application. Note that such
deactivation could be largely ascribed to the blocking of the active Lewis
acid sites by carbon deposition, rather than a signiﬁcant degradation
of the textural or structural properties of the mesoporous β-Ga2O3-S4
material (Table 1). For regenerating β-Ga2O3-S4 that reacted 8 h on
stream at 773 K, the reaction was interrupted under an N2 stream, and
then air was introduced at 923 K to burn off carbon species deposited
on the catalyst (Fig. 5). After the ﬁrst regeneration, the initial propane
conversion for β-Ga2O3-S4 amounted to 39% at 773 K, which is slightly
lower than that for the fresh sample (43.7%). However, after the second
and third regenerations, only marginal variations in initial activity were
observed. Analogous phenomenon was reported by Zheng et al. in regen-
eration of β-Ga2O3 [18].
4. Conclusions
The present work demonstrates the high potential of using environ-
mentally friendly sucrose as a non-surfactant template to prepare
mesoporous β-Ga2O3 materials with favorable textural and structural
properties for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. It is important
to highlight here that this approach is not limited to the use of sucrose
as the carbohydrate-based carbon sources (see Table S1). The present
ﬁndings may provide new opportunities for the rational design of new
mesostructured gallium oxide catalyst systems for advanced applications.
