Abstract 
An Al2O3 material assembled by nanoflakes was used to prepare supported CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst via 
a deposition-precipitation method for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2. Both 
unsupported and commercial Al2O3-supported CeO2-ZrO2 were prepared for comparison. It was 
found that the CeO2-ZrO2/nanoflake-assembled Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic activity. 
The characterization results revealed that the slit-shape pores existing in nanoflake-assembled 
Al2O3 were responsible for the small particle size and high Ce/Zr surface ratio of supported 
CeO2-ZrO2 species. The dispersion of Ce1-xZrx(OH)4 precursors onto Al2O3 support surface during 
the deposition-precipitation process was proposed. The high dispersion and large numbers of 
surface oxygen vacancies of the CeO2-ZrO2 species on nanoflake-assembled Al2O3 contributed to 
the excellent catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2. This 
kind of special Al2O3 is expected to be a promising support for preparing highly dispersed 
metal/metal oxide catalysts.

1 Introduction 
The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes and 
ethylbenzene (EB) has received significant attentions in recent years [1-4]. Styrene (ST), an 
important monomer for synthetic polymers, is commercially produced by EB dehydrogenation in 
the presence of a large quality of superheated steam, which serves as a diluent, a heat carrier, and a 
decoking reactant [5-7]. However, the unavoidable loss of heat in the steam condensation leads 
this process to be highly energy-consuming. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 
(CO2-ODEB) is a promising route to replace the above commercial process, since it has been 
estimated that the amount of required energy for yielding per ton ST can be decreased from 
1.5×106 kcal via the commercial process to 1.9×105 kcal via the CO2-ODEB route [6]. 
Furthermore, several advantages such as accelerating the reaction rate, alleviating the chemical 
equilibrium and enhancing the ST yield are also proposed [7]. Therefore, the development of 
efficient catalysts for this energy-saving process is highly desirable. 
Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions are important materials as catalysts or catalyst supports for many 
redox reactions due to the excellent redox properties [8-11]. The presence of cerium can provide a 
better reduction capacity for catalyst at all the temperatures studied, in contrast with the other 
non-cerium catalysts. This is consistent with the well-known oxygen storage/release capacity of 
ceria owing to oxygen vacancies in the catalyst [12]. In the field of CO2-ODEB, Ce1-xZrxO2-based 
materials have been extensively investigated and show satisfactory performances [13-17]. The 
catalytic performance of Ce1-xZrxO2 highly depends on its physicochemical properties, including 
the crystalline phase, particle size, special surface area, surface composition and density of oxygen 
vacancy. Unfortunately, unsupported Ce1-xZrxO2 catalysts are susceptible to sintering at high 
temperatures [18]. An effective method to overcome this drawback is to stabilize Ce1-xZrxO2 on 
thermally stable supports such as SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2 and MFI [19-22]. 
Al2O3 materials have been widely used as catalyst supports owing to the large surface area and 
both chemical and thermal stability. Their surface properties not only influence the dispersion of 
active species but also tailor the chemical environment of active sites. In past several years, a 
special Al2O3 assembled by nanosheets, nanoflakes or nanoplates, which usually presents 
hierarchically flower-like microstructure, has been developed and used as support for metal 
catalysts [23-25]. It exhibits some unexpected advantages especially in the improvement of metal 
dispersion. In a previous work [23], a flower-like Al2O3@Co-Cu-Al catalyst was designed via a 
layered double hydroxide precursor route for the oxidation of EB. This heterogeneous Co-based 
catalyst exhibited a high dispersion of cobalt species due to the interactions between the Co-Cu 
species in the well-developed three-dimensional flower-like platelets. Zhang et al. [24] 
synthesized flower-like Ni/γ-Al2O3 composites by a facile hydrothermal method for methane dry 
reforming. The hierarchical spinel intermediates embedded Ni nanoparticles in nanoflakes of the 
hollow Al2O3 microspheres, and the strong metal-support interactions resulted in a high dispersion 
of Ni. More recently, Zhao et al. [25] prepared hierarchical core-shell Al2O3@Pd-CoAlO 
microspheres with a flower-like shell assembled by nanosheets. The excellent catalytic efficiency 
of this novel catalyst for toluene combustion was attributed to the homogeneous distribution of 
catalytically active Pd-CoAlO nanosheets on the Al2O3 supports. The above reports indicate that 
this kind of hierarchical Al2O3 support is beneficial to the formation of highly dispersed metal 
species on catalyst surface.  
Herein, a nanoflake-assembled Al2O3 synthesized by a hydrothermal method was used to 
prepare supported CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst via a deposition-precipitation method. It was found that the 
special pore structure of nanoflake-assembled Al2O3 can effectively improve the dispersion and 
Ce/Zr surface ratio of CeO2-ZrO2 species, which further determined its excellent catalytic 
performance in CO2-ODEB reaction.  
2 Experiments 
2.1 Catalyst preparations 
Nanoflake-assembled Al2O3, labeled as NFA, was prepared via a hydrothermal method 
according to a previous literature [26]. A commercial Al2O3 support, labeled as CA, was purchased 
from Sinopharm Chemical. 
Supported CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts were prepared by a previous deposition-precipitation method 
with some modifications [20]. Typically, 1 g of NFA or CA powders was dispersed into 400 ml of 
deionized water under vigorous stirring for 2 h. 40 ml of aqueous solution containing 1.45 mmol 
of (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 and 1.45 mmol of Zr(NO3)4·5H2O was dropped into the suspension. Then, 360 
ml of additional deionized water was added and the resultant suspension was stirred for another 1 
h. Thereafter, the pH of the solution was adjusted to ~8 using diluted NH3·H2O (2.5 wt%) under 
vigorous stirring. The light yellow solids were immediately filtered and washed with deionized 
water for several times, followed by drying at 100 oC overnight. Finally, the supported CeO2-ZrO2 
catalysts, labeled as CZ/NFA or CZ/CA, were obtained by calcination of above solids at 600 oC 
for 4 h in static air. The percentage of CeO2-ZrO2 in the catalysts was 30 wt% and the nominal 
Ce/Zr ratio was 1. For comparison, unsupported CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst, labeled as CZ, was prepared 
following the above procedure except that no support was introduced. 
2.2 Characterization techniques 
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were obtained on a Zeiss Supra 
55 microscope. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were 
recorded on a FEI Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired on a 
Panalytical X’Pert Pro MPD diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (0.15406 nm) at 40 kV and 40 
mA. N2 physisorption experiments were performed on an automatic analyzer (3H-2000PM1, 
Beishide, China) at -196 oC. All samples were outgassed under vacuum at 200 oC for 2 h prior to 
the measurement. The special surface area was calculated by the BET method. The pore volume 
was taken at the P/P0=0.98 single point. The pore size distribution was obtained by applying the 
BJH formalism to both the adsorption and desorption branch of the isotherm. 
H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were performed on a chemical 
adsorption instrument (PCA-1200, Builder, China). 50 mg of sample was pretreated at 300 oC for 
30 min in N2 (40 ml/min). After cooling to room temperature, TPR experiment was carried out in 
H2/N2 (5%/95% in volume, 30 ml/min) in the range of 100 to 900 oC with a heating rate of 10 
oC/min. 
UV-Vis diffuse reflectance (UV-Vis DR) spectra were recorded on a Jasco V-550 
spectrophotometer in the range of 200 to 800 nm referenced to BaSO4. UV Raman spectra were 
collected in the anti-Stokes range of 100-2000 cm-1 on a DL-2 Raman spectrometer using a He-Gd 
laser (excitation wavelength of 325 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was 
performed on a Thermo VG ESCALAB 250 Microprobe instrument using Al Kα radiation as the 
X-ray source. The binding energy of the element was calibrated using a C 1s photoelectron peak at 
284.6 eV.  
2.3 Catalytic tests 
CO2-ODEB reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed quartz tubular reactor with an inner diameter 
of 4 mm at 600 oC under an atmospheric pressure. Before the reaction, 0.3 g of catalyst was placed 
at the center of the reactor with quartz wool plugs and then purged with N2 at 600 oC for 1 h. The 
reaction was started by changing the atmosphere from N2 to a reaction mixture gas of CO2 and EB 
vapours with a molar ratio of 20, which was produced by bubbling a CO2 flow (20 ml/min) 
through a liquid EB held at 50 oC in a thermostat. The cooling products were analyzed by gas 
chromatography on Agilent-6890 equipped with a FID detector and capillary column of HP-5. 
3 Results and discussions 
3.1 Physicochemical properties of the catalyst materials 
The morphologies of CA and NFA supports were determined using FESEM. Fig. 1a shows the 
FESEM image of CA support, which indicates that the sample is composed by a large number of 
irregular particles. By contrast, NFA support consists of numerous nanoflake-assembled 
architectures, as shown in Fig. 1b. A closer inspection in Fig. 1c reveals that the thickness of these 
nanoflakes is about 40 nm. 
 
 
Fig. 2 shows the HRTEM images of CZ, CZ/CA and CZ/NFA catalysts. The lattice fringes with 
the interplanar spacing of 0.31 nm associated with the cubic (111) or tetragonal (111) facet of 
Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions suggests that the CeO2-ZrO2 species of these catalysts were well 
crystallized after calcination [27, 28]. The average particle sizes are 7.0, 4.5 and 4.0 nm for CZ, 
CZ/CA and CZ/NFA, respectively. The significant decrease in the particle size of Ce1-xZrxO2 
nanoparticles in the supported catalysts, especially in CZ/NFA, implies the improved dispersion of 
CeO2-ZrO2 species. 
 
 
Fig. 3 shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of both the supports and the CeO2-ZrO2 
catalysts. All samples display non-reversible adsorption-desorption isotherms with hysteresis 
loops characteristic of capillary condensation in mesopores. The hysteresis loops of CZ, CA 
support, and CZ/CA are classified as type H2 and suggest the presence of intraparticle mesopore 
[29]. By comparison, NFA support and CZ/NFA exhibit the hysteresis loops of type H3, reflecting 
the slit-shape pores associated with the space between the neighboring nanoflakes of the 
nanostructures [29]. The loading of CeO2-ZrO2 results in different changes in the isotherms of the 
two supports. There is a remarkable decrease in the adsorption volume at P/P0>0.9 in the isotherm 
of CZ/CA, compared to CA support. Whereas, CZ/NFA shows the isotherm similar to NFA 
support. 
 
 
Fig. 4 depicts the pore size distributions (PSD) curves of the samples in the 1.7-100 nm range. 
In the aspect of desorption PSD curves (Fig. 4a-c), CZ catalyst displays a unimodal PSD with a 
pore diameter at 3.5 nm, resulted from the aggregation of nanoparticles. For the two supports, CA 
presents a pore diameter of around 8.0 nm. By contrast, the PSD of NFA exhibits a hierarchical 
porosity consisting of a narrow pore centered at 3.4 nm, derived from the inter space among 
primary Al2O3 particles, and a broad interpenetrating meso-macropore, indicative of the slits 
between the adjacent nanoflakes. Generally, the particle size of nuclei formed in solution during 
precipitation process ranges from 4 to 20 nm [30]. Thus it is difficult to deposit precipitates into 
the pore of a support, of which the diameter is smaller than the particle size of precipitate nuclei. 
Comparing the PSD curves of CA and NFA, it can be inferred that the slit-shape pores of NFA is 
more accessible to Ce1-xZrx(OH)4 precipitates than the intraparticle pores of CA during the 
deposition-precipitation process. After loading CeO2-ZrO2 species, the PSD of CZ/CA shows the 
shape similar to CA and an additional narrow peak around 3.5 nm, meaning that the loaded 
CeO2-ZrO2 species hardly locate into the intraparticle pores of CA support but instead aggregate 
on the surface. In the case of CZ/NFA, a newly broad peak at 6.4 nm appears in its PSD curves, 
which may be resulted from the incorporation of CeO2-ZrO2 species into the slit-shape pores of 
NFA. Considering that the peak around 3.5 nm in Fig. 4a-c might be caused from tensile strength 
effect of the adsorbed phase [31], the adsorption PSD curves for these materials are also provided 
and displayed in Fig. 4d-f. As observed in Fig. 4d, unsupported CZ represents a single peak 
around 3.0 nm. Comparing the curves of CA and CZ/CA in Fig. 4e, it is found that the loading of 
CeO2-ZrO2 leads to an obvious decrease in the intensity of the curve for CA, except for the pore 
around 3.0 nm due to the aggregated CeO2-ZrO2 nanoparticles on the surface. By contrast, the 
incorporation of CeO2-ZrO2 into NFA results in a newly shown shoulder peak at around 8.0 nm 
(Fig. 4f). These results are consistent with the observations in the desorption PSD curves. Thus, 
the presence of false pore in these materials can be ruled out. 
 
 
The textural data of the samples are gathered in Table 1. Compared to the supported CeO2-ZrO2 
catalysts, CZ has the lowest special surface area (SBET) and pore volume (Vp) due to the 
aggregation characteristic. As expected, the loading of CeO2-ZrO2 species leads to decreases in 
SBET and Vp for CA support because of partial pore blockage as well as a dilution effect by 
CeO2-ZrO2 species [29]. However, CZ/NFA shows textural data similar to NFA support. This 
suggests that the hierarchical porosity of NFA is hardly closed off by the metal oxide particles 
compared to the exclusively intraparticle porosity of CA. 
 
 
The surface compositions for the catalysts were analyzed using XPS technique. As seen in Table 
1, all CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts show Ce/Zr surface ratios below 1, a nominal ratio for them. This result 
reflects the Zr-rich surface and the Ce-rich core of their CeO2-ZrO2 species [32]. Compared to CZ, 
CZ/CA and CZ/NFA possess the relatively higher ratios of 0.56 and 0.60, respectively, indicating 
that the core-shell structure of their CeO2-ZrO2 species is partially disrupted. The higher value for 
CZ/NFA than CZ/CA suggests that NFA support shows an advantage over CA support in 
disturbing the core-shell structure. The (Ce+Zr)/Al surface ratios of CZ/CA and CZ/NFA are also 
displayed in Table 1. It can be seen that the value of CZ/NFA is lower than that of CZ/CA. 
Combining this result with the higher CeO2-ZrO2 dispersion for CZ/NFA observed by HRTEM, it 
can be deduced that many CeO2-ZrO2 species of CZ/NFA are inside the slit-shape pores rather 
than preferentially on the outer surface of NFA support [33], in accord with the observation of its 
PSD in Fig. 4c and 4f. 
The XRD patterns of the CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. In addition to the two 
diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS 10-0425) at 245.8o and 66.9o for the two supported 
catalysts, all samples present four main characteristic diffraction peaks at 229.4o, 33.8o,48.8o, 
and 58.0o and no separated single oxides of CeO2 and ZrO2 are detected. These results demonstrate 
the formation of Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions [34], in agreement with the observation of HRTEM. 
For CZ, a Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 phase can be distinguished [34]. It is worth noting that the peak at 2=29.4o 
is slightly asymmetric. Generally, the asymmetric shape of diffraction peaks for Ce1-xZrxO2 means 
the segregation of the Ce-rich and Zr-rich phases due to the heterogeneous distribution of Ce4+ and 
Zr4+ cations in the oxides [35, 36]. Herein, the slight asymmetric peak of CZ reflects that the metal 
cations are inhomogeneously distributed, in accord with the fact that the main phase of CZ differs 
from an ideal Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 phase with the Ce/Zr ratio of 1. In the case of the supported CeO2-ZrO2 
catalysts, the asymmetry of this diffraction peak becomes more evident, to the extent that it splits 
into two peaks at 2=29.0o and 29.6o for CZ/NFA, corresponding to Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and Ce0.3Zr0.7O2 
phases, respectively [34]. This result indicates that the NFA support has a more significant effect 
on the Ce4+/Zr4+ distribution than CA support, in agreement with the XPS results. 
 
 
Based on the above results, it is noted that the Al2O3 supports significantly influence both the 
dispersion and the surface compositions of CeO2-ZrO2 species. Compared to CA, NFA support is a 
superior support that not only enhances the dispersion of CeO2-ZrO2 species, but also increases 
the Ce/Zr surface ratio.  
The differences in the dispersion and the atomic distribution of CeO2-ZrO2 species in the 
catalysts can be explained by the formation mechanism of Ce and Zr precursors during the 
precipitation processes. Fig. 6 shows the schematic of synthesis processes for the three catalysts. It 
is necessary to take into account that the solubility constant (Ksp) of Ce(OH)4 is several orders of 
magnitude lower than that of Zr(OH)4, with Ksp of 410-51 and 210-48, respectively [32]. Thus, 
the precipitation rate of Ce(OH)4 is faster than that of Zr(OH)4 during the coprecipitation process 
of Ce4+ and Zr4+ in alkali media. In the coprecipitation process for preparing CZ, Ce-rich 
hydroxide precipitates are initially formed and act as nucleating agents for Zr-rich precipitates at 
the final stage. This fact results in the core/shell structure of CZ with a low Ce/Zr surface ratio, as 
confirmed by XPS. The large particles and intraparticle pore of CZ, as observed in the HRTEM 
image and the PSD curve, respectively, are inevitably formed due to the high-temperature 
sintering during the transformation of these Ce1-xZrx(OH)4 precursors into oxides.  
For 
the 
Al2O3-supported 
CeO2-ZrO2 
catalysts, 
a 
different 
situation 
in 
the 
deposition-precipitation process can be inferred. In general, a supersaturated solution is necessary 
for the formation of precipitate nuclei in the solution in order to compensate for the considerable 
surface energy of nuclei particles [37]. When supports are introduced into the solution, although 
precipitates can form in the solution and on the support surface simultaneously, the nucleation rate 
of precipitates on support surface is much higher because the relatively lower nucleation barrier 
[37, 38]. In the present work, it is rational that the initial Ce-rich precipitates are deposited 
preferentially onto the Al2O3 support surface, accompanied by the formation of a few Ce-rich 
nuclei in the solution. Those Ce-rich nuclei formed in the solution are severely defected [39], and 
tend to adhere to the Ce-rich precipitates deposited on Al2O3 or to uncovered Al2O3 surface under 
vigorous stirring [37, 40, 41]. With the concentration of Ce4+ in the solution decreasing, Zr-rich 
hydroxides are formed and deposited on the Ce-rich precipitate surface to form a core/shell 
structure or directly on the uncovered Al2O3 surface. This model of dispersing Ce1-xZrx(OH)4 
precursors onto the surface of Al2O3 supports can account for the higher Ce/Zr surface ratios and 
higher dispersions of CeO2-ZrO2 species in the supported catalysts than in unsupported CZ, as 
substantiated by XPS and HRTEM. In this respect, the accessible surface of Al2O3 support is 
essential to the dispersion of Ce1-xZrx(OH)4 precursors. Since the slit-shape pores of NFA are 
much more exposed to the hydroxide precursors than intraparticle pores of CA, as suggested by 
their PSD curves, CZ/NFA exhibits both higher Ce/Zr surface ratio and higher dispersion of 
CeO2-ZrO2 species than CZ/CA.  
 
Fig. 7 shows the H2-TPR profiles of the three CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts. Generally, the TPR profile 
of Ce1-xZrxO2 samples shows two main reduction peaks around 550 and 800 oC, attributed to the 
reduction of surface and bulk Ce4+ cations, respectively [8, 42]. The surface Ce4+ ions are easily 
reduced because the unsaturated surface oxygen anions can be removed by hydrogen at low 
temperature, while the bulk Ce4+ ions are reduced only when the bulk oxygen species have been 
transported to the surface region at high temperature [8]. In this work, only one broad asymmetric 
reduction peak is displayed in the range of 300 to 700 oC for these CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts. It could 
be attributed to the overlap of reduction peaks of both surface and bulk Ce4+ cations due to the 
small nanoparticles of their CeO2-ZrO2 species, which are beneficial to the diffusion of bulk 
oxygen species. Compared with CZ, CZ/CA and CZ/NFA exhibit moderate decreases in reduction 
temperature to 565 and 551 oC, respectively, reflecting the smaller particle sizes of CeO2-ZrO2 
species on the supported catalysts. The CeO2-ZrO2 species dispersed on NFA surface may have the 
smallest particle size. 
 
The UV-Vis DR spectra of the catalysts were shown in Fig. 8. All catalysts show broad bands in 
the range of 200 to 600 nm. It is known that pure CeO2 presents three absorption maxima centered 
at ~255, 285, and 340 nm in its UV-Vis DR spectrum [43]. The former one is attributed to the 
Ce3+O2- charge transfer transitions, while the latter two are ascribed to Ce4+O2- charge 
transfer and inter-band transitions, respectively. On the other hand, the spectrum of pure ZrO2 
exhibits a main absorption at 211 nm with a shoulder in the region of 290 to 400 nm [44]. Thus, 
the broad bands of the CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts are the result of the superposition of the above 
absorption bands. Remarkably, the absorption edges of CZ/CA and CZ/NFA are significantly 
blue-shifted with respect to CZ, pointing out the decrease in particle size of the CeO2-ZrO2 species 
[45]. CZ/NFA shows a more obvious blue-shift of absorption edge than CZ/CA, indicating that the 
CeO2-ZrO2 species in the former case possess a smaller particle size. The results of H2-TPR and 
UV-Vis DR further substantiate the observation of HRTEM that the CeO2-ZrO2 species supported 
on NFA are better dispersed than on CA. 
 
Fig. 9 displays the UV Raman spectra of the CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts. UV Raman spectroscopy 
using excitation wavelength of 325 nm mainly reflects the surface information on the catalyst [46]. 
In Fig. 9, both CZ and CZ/NFA show a main band around 630 cm-1 and a weak band around 460 
cm-1, corresponding to the oxygen vacancies and the symmetric stretching F2g mode of Ce-O, 
respectively [34, 43]. The defect-related band around 630 cm-1 of CZ/NFA is more intensive than 
that of CZ, suggesting that there are more oxygen vacancies on CZ/NFA surface. The spectrum of 
CZ/CA (not given) is difficult to be analyzed due to strong fluorescence interference. 
 
The Ce 3d XPS spectra of the CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts are plotted in Fig. 10. These Ce 3d spectra 
consist of eight peaks related to four different spin-orbit doublets. Among them, the peaks labeled 
as u, u´´ and u´´´ are attributed to Ce4+ 3d3/2 and those remarked as v, v´´ and v´´´ arise from Ce4+ 
3d5/2, while the doublet u´ and v´ are characterized of Ce3+ 3d3/2 and Ce3+ 3d5/2, respectively [47]. 
The proportion of Ce3+ in the total Ce species based on the area ratios of v´/(v+v´+v´´+v´´´) are 
shown in Table 1. It can be seen that the values of Ce3+/(Ce3++Ce4+) of CZ/CA and CZ/NFA are 
21.9% and 23.8%, respectively, which are higher than that of CZ. Since the surface oxygen 
vacancy of Ce1-xZrxO2 materials locates between two neighbouring Ce3+ ions in the surface region 
[48]. The higher relative concentrations of Ce3+ for the supported CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts signify the 
more surface oxygen vacancies, in agreement with the UV Raman result. Although Zr-doping into 
CeO2 facilitates the generation of oxygen vacancies, the excess amount of Zr will decrease the 
amount of neighbouring Ce ions and hinder the formation of oxygen vacancies [49]. Therefore, the 
increased Ce/Zr surface ratios of CZ/CA and CZ/NFA, as listed in Table 1, may contribute to their 
higher Ce3+/(Ce3++Ce4+) ratios and thereby the more surface oxygen vacancies. Among the two 
supported catalysts of CZ/CA and CZ/NFA, the higher proportion of Ce3+ for CZ/NFA indicates 
that the CeO2-ZrO2 species on NFA surface possess the larger amount of oxygen vacancies.  
 
 
The above-mentioned characterizations of FESEM, HRTEM, N2 physisorption, XPS, XRD, 
H2-TPR, UV-Vis DR and UV Raman indicate that the pore structure of Al2O3 support has great 
influences on the precipitation process of metal cations and subsequently on the dispersion and 
surface properties of CeO2-ZrO2 species in the catalysts. During the preparation process for CZ in 
which Al2O3 support is absent, the Ce1-xZrx(OH)4 precursors aggregate into Ce-rich core/Zr-rich 
shell structure, resulting in the low dispersion and Ce/Zr surface ratio of its CeO2-ZrO2 species. 
Moreover, the Zr-rich surface hinders the formation of surface oxygen vacancies. For the 
preparation of the supported CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts, the Al2O3 supports disperse the Ce1-xZrx(OH)4 
precursors and disturb the formation of core/shell structure, leading to significant improvements in 
the dispersion and Ce/Zr surface ratio of the CeO2-ZrO2 species, as well as the generation of 
surface oxygen vacancies. Among the two supported catalysts of CZ/CA and CZ/NFA, the 
nanoflake-assembled support of CZ/NFA possesses slit-shape pores, which expose more 
accessible surface than the intraparticle pores of CA support for the dispersion of Ce1-xZrx(OH)4 
precursors during the deposition-precipitation process. Therefore, CZ/NFA has both the higher 
CeO2-ZrO2 dispersion and the larger number of surface oxygen vacancies than CZ/CA. 
3.2 Catalytic performance in CO2-ODEB 
The catalytic performances of these CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts in CO2-ODEB are shown in Fig. 11. In 
accordance with the characteristics of CO2-ODEB, all catalysts show high steady-state selectivity 
of >96% towards ST. However, the EB conversions over the supported catalysts of CZ/CA and 
CZ/NFA are much higher than unsupported CZ. The enhanced activities can be related to the 
improvements in the dispersion and the formation of surface oxygen vacancies of the supported 
CeO2-ZrO2 species, since high CeO2-ZrO2 dispersion results in a high density of active species and 
surface oxygen vacancies are important sites involving with the redox process for EB 
dehydrogenation over Ce-based catalysts [14, 50, 51]. Most importantly, CZ/NFA catalyst exhibits 
a superior activity than CZ/CA, indicating the CeO2-ZrO2 species supported on NFA are more 
efficient than on CA. As aforementioned, the slit-shape pores of NFA are more accessible to the 
Ce1-xZrx(OH)4 precursors than the intraparticle pores of CA. This leads to the higher CeO2-ZrO2 
dispersion and more surface oxygen vacancies present on CZ/NFA, thereby contributing to the 
superior activity.  
 
 
4 Conclusions 
The pore structure of Al2O3 support was a key factor influencing the physicochemical properties 
and catalytic activity of supported CeO2-ZrO2 species. It was found that numerous slit-shape pores 
existed in NFA support, while exclusive intraparticle pores were present in CA support. Since the 
slit-shape 
pores 
were 
more 
accessible 
to 
Ce1-xZrx(OH)4 
precursors 
during 
the 
deposition-precipitation process, NFA was a superior support that not only dispersed the 
hydroxides precursors but also disturbed the Ce-rich core/Zr-rich shell structure. The resultant CZ 
CZ/NFA catalyst exhibited both the highest dispersion and the highest Ce/Zr surface ratio among 
the catalysts investigated. Furthermore, the increased Ce/Zr surface ratio of CZ/NFA endowed this 
catalyst with the largest number of surface oxygen vacancies. Therefore, the CeO2-ZrO2 species of 
CZ/NFA were catalytically efficient in CO2-ODEB. This kind of nanoflake-assembled Al2O3 may 
be an excellent support to prepare highly dispersed metal/metal oxide catalysts.
