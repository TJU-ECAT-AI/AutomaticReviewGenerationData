Abstract
Oxidized diamond played a significant role as an efficient support for a Cr2O3-loaded catalyst during the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 in the presence of carbon dioxide at 923 K, giving a 22.5% C2H4 yield with a 87.7% C2H4 selectivity. The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was about 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst increased with increasing CO2 partial pressures. XPS analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 maintained the surface Cr2O3 at a higher-oxidation state than the reaction in the absence of CO2. On the other hand, bulk of Cr2O3 was not reduced in either atmosphere.

1. Introduction
Recently, the surface chemistry of diamond has received much attention, and several functional groups have been introduced onto the diamond surface. 1-3 However, the limit and scope of diamond or oxidized diamond-supported catalyst have not been yet revealed. Further applications of the diamond-supported catalyst need to be explored. Diamond has long been considered an inert material. One of the present authors demonstrated that the diamond surface behaved in the manner of an organic substances.1 In addition, the diamond surface is expected to express possible chemical reactivities as organic molecules.3 This led us to develop the novel utilization of diamond as a catalyst or catalyst−support material for chemical reactions.
Oxidized diamond has recently drawn attention as a new unique material phase as a solid carbon oxide. The diamond surface is easily oxidized by oxidative acids such as HNO3, HClO, H2O2, etc. and is also oxidized with oxygen at an elevated temperature to form C−O−C ether-type structures and CO carbonyl-type structures.1 Until now, no carbon-oxide solid phase has been found; however, the surface of oxidized diamond is considered to be a pseudo-carbon-oxide solid phase. The oxidized diamond surface is expected to behave as a carbon oxide for specified surface reactions such as catalytic, electrochemical reactions. Because such reactions must be controlled by the interaction between molecules and surfaces, the bulk structures of solids are less important. Silicon oxide (called silica) is widely used as a neutral support for many catalytic reactions. Silica support has very weak interactions with some metals and metal oxides and plays an important role in yielding active reaction sites due to its high surface area.
Activated carbon has been widely utilized as a support material for metal or metal oxide-loaded catalysts. Activated carbon is composed of amorphous sp2 carbon atoms. Recently, carbon nanofilaments have been reported as a novel carbon material that can be used for catalytic processes. 4 No carbon material constituted of pure sp3 carbon atoms (diamond) has been examined as a catalyst−support material. However, our recent study of oxidized diamond-supported chromium oxide (III) or nickel exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, 5,6 the partial oxidation of CH4, 7,8 and the decomposition of CH3OH to synthesis gas, 9 respectively. In these reactions, weak but significant interactions between loaded metal catalysts and support surfaces seemed to play important roles in enhancing and prolonging the activity of the respective catalysts. Oxidized diamond behaved as solid carbon oxide material and presents an excellent support material for catalysts.
C2H4 is predominantly produced by steam cracking of naphtha, C2H6, or liquefied petroleum gas at high temperatures at a short residence time. To reduce the energy consumption of C2H4 production, oxidative dehydrogenation required by C2H6 is proposed (reaction 2).
The reaction becomes exothermic and could be thermodynamically possible at a lower temperature. However, it is necessary to remove heat from the reaction and to control over-oxidation to COx to keep high selectivity to C2H4. Recently, a great variety of catalysts have been developed and tested to achieve this reaction. 10-13 In the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 and C3H8, some reports 14,15 have pointed out that thermal noncatalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 and C3H8 proceeded to give alkene in the same yield as compared to catalyzed runs which were operated at higher temperatures than those in noncatalyzed runs. This suggests that the catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is not highly superior to thermal nonoxidative pyrolysis. Recently, CO2 has been investigated as a mild oxidant for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, 16-18 C2H6, 19,20 or C3H8, 21,22 since many investigators have suggested that the catalyzed oxidative reactions of lower alkanes with oxygen have a lesser advantage. We first found that CO2 markedly promoted dehydrogenation of C2H6 over Ga2O3-based catalysts 23-25 and the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst 5 with high selectivity (reaction 3).
In this work, we dealt with the performance of oxidized diamond as a new support material for the Cr2O3-loaded catalyst in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 and found that the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst markedly promoted dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 in the presence of CO2. We applied oxidized diamond surfaces as a new catalytic support for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to yield C2H4 and elucidated the roles of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the oxidized diamond-supported catalysts.
2. Experimental Section
To have a reactivity for a catalytic reaction and a hydrophilicity for impregnating metal oxides as an active material on the diamond surface, oxidized diamond was prepared by the oxidation of commercial fine-powdered diamond at 723 K for 1 h under a stream of O2−Ar (1:4) mixed gases. Before oxidation, to eliminate impurities and activate the diamond surface, diamond powder was hydrogenated at 1173 K for 1 h. Catalysts were prepared by impregnating aqueous solutions of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.), Ga(NO3)3·8H2O (Kishida Chemicals), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, (CH3COO)2Mn·4H2O (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.), (NH4)4VO3 and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (Nacalai tesque, Inc.) to Al2O3 (JRC-ALO-4, the reference catalyst provided by the Catalyst Society of Japan), SiO2 (Merck), activated carbon (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.), and oxidized diamond (B.E.T. surface area = 12.6 m2·g-1), and they were evaporated to dryness. Supported catalysts were calcined at 723 K for 3 h in air prior to the reaction. The reaction was carried out using a fixed-bed flow-type quartz reactor (i.d. 10 mm × 350 mm) at atmospheric pressure. Using 200 mg of a catalyst, 5 mL/min C2H6 and 25 mL/min of CO2 or Ar were introduced. Analyses of the C1, C2, and C3 hydrocarbon gases were carried out using a Shimadzu GC14BPF gas chromatograph (FID detector) equipped with a 3 mm × 3 m glass column packed with Porapack Q in N2 carrier. Analyses of CO, CO2, and CH4 were carried out using a Shimadzu GC8AIT gas chromatograph (TCD detector) equipped with a 3 mm × 3 m stainless steel column packed with activated carbon (30/60 mesh) using He as a carrier gas. Analyses of H2 were carried out using a Shimadzu GC8AIT gas chromatograph (TCD detector) equipped with a 3 mm × 3 m stainless steel column packed with an activated carbon (30/60 mesh) and with N2 carrier. The surface area of the catalyst was measured by the BET method using N2 at 77 K using an automatic Micromeritics Gemini model 2375.
Diffuse reflectance IR spectra were recorded on an FT-IR instrument (JIR-7000, JEOL) equipped with a cooled MCT detector in the region of 400−4000 cm-1 at a resolution of 2 cm-1. A KBr standard powder was used for the reference spectrum. Diffuse reflectance was converted into Kubelka−Munk function units. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Simadzu XRD-6000 utilizing monochromatized Cu Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results were obtained using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (JPS-9000MX, JEOL) using Mg Kα radiation as the energy source. Raman spectroscopy with a 1-μm depth resolution by Ar+ laser excitation (NR-1800MB, Jasco) was used.
Transient response measurements of the catalyst bed temperature during the pulsed reactions were carried out using a fixed-bed quartz reactor (i.d. 4 mm × 200 mm) which was set in a horizontal position in an electric furnace. Two thin-wall sheathed thermocouples (o.d. 0.6 mm) were fixed at the front and the rear end of the catalyst bed, and 100 mg of the catalyst was charged. The reaction system has been described elsewhere in detail.24 A pulse of C2H6 was introduced by means of a six-port gas-sampling valve equipped with measuring tubes, under a stream of CO2 or Ar carrier gas. The reaction temperature was controlled using a programmable controller that monitored the outside temperature of the reactor wall.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Diffuse Reflectance FT-IR Spectroscopic Analysis of Hydrogenated and Oxidized Diamonds. Figure 1 shows the diffuse reflectance FT-IR spectra of hydrogenated and oxidized diamonds. The spectrum of hydrogenated diamond contained bands in the region of 2800−2970 cm-1 (Figure 1a), which were ascribed to C−H stretching vibrations (νC−H) of sp3 hybridized bonding.1,27,28 Oxidized diamond was obtained by the oxidation of hydrogenated diamond at 723 K for 1 h under a stream of O2−Ar (1:4 mixture). No significant C−H stretching vibrations were observed on the oxidized diamond (Figure 1b). The spectrum of oxidized diamond contained bands in the region of 1650−1850 cm-1 (Figure 1b), which were ascribed to CO stretching vibrations (νCO), and absorptions at 1150 and 1250 cm-1 were assigned to C−O−C stretching vibrations (νC−O). 26 These results indicated that oxygen species were introduced into the diamond surface.

3.2. Dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the Presence of CO2 over Oxidized Diamond-Supported Metal Oxide Catalysts. Figure 2 shows C2H4 yields on various oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts in the presence or absence of CO2. Thermal dehydrogenation gave only a c.a. 2.5% of C2H4 yield in both CO2 and Ar atmospheres. Equilibrium conversion of C2H6 to C2H4 is ca. 50% at 923 K at a C2H6−CO2 ratio of 1:5. The order of the activity of various oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 at the reaction temperature of 923 K was as follows:  Cr2O3 > V2O5 > MoO3 > Ga2O3 > CeO2 > Mn3O4 > Fe2O3 > Sm2O3 > CaO > Tb4O6 > Y2O3 > SnO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > Pr6O11. The C2H4 selectivities in all the metal oxide catalysts were higher than 85% in the dehydrogenation under CO2 atmosphere. Oxidized diamond alone and Sm-, Ca-, Tb-, Y-, Sn-, Zn-, La-, and Pr-loaded on oxidized diamond catalysts did not show catalytic activity. Oxidized diamond-supported Mo, Ga, Ce, Zr, Mn, and Fe oxide catalysts exhibited slight catalytic activity. Mo-, Ga-, Ce-, and Fe-containing catalysts were known to be active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of O2 or steam. The oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst afforded the highest yield of C2H4 (22.5%) among various oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts.

Reaction conditions:  temperature:  923 K, reaction time:  0.5 h, C2H6:CO2 (Ar) = 5:25 (mL/mL), catalyst = 200 mg, SV = 9000 h-1 mL/g-cat, numerals in parentheses: surface area (m2/g), M:oxidized diamond = 5:95 (wt %).
The promoting effects of CO2 on C2H4 yield were observed over oxidized diamond-supported Cr, V, Mo, Ga, and Ce catalysts (Table 1). In particular, the activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2. Dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst produced mainly C2H4, CO, H2, and H2O. The promoting effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 on the Ga2O3 was twice that under Ar atomosphere.23 In the case of Ga2O3/TiO2, the conversion of C2H6 in the presence of CO2 increased twice that in the presence of Ar; however, a secondary reaction such as the decomposition of C2H6 or C2H4 occurred to give CH4 decreasing C2H4 selectivity.24,25 In the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, the increase in C2H4 yield was about 17% in the presence of CO2. One of the characteristic features of diamond support is a higher C2H4 selectivity. By using this support, the absence of secondary reactions with reactants or products could probably be prevented.

3.3. Effect of Support on the Dehydrogenation of C2H6 over Cr2O3-Loaded Catalysts. Oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts were compared to unsupported metal oxide or Cr2O3-loaded catalysts on various support materials. Figure 3 shows C2H4 yields on bulk metal oxide and Cr2O3-loaded on various support materials. The order of the activity compared by unit Cr and by unit surface area at a reaction temperature of 923 K was as follows:  Oxidized diamond > unsupported Cr2O3 > Al2O3 > SiO2 > activated carbon. The C2H4 selectivities in all the metal oxide catalysts were higher than 90% in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2. However, the unsupported Cr2O3 catalyst showed a lower C2H4 yield than did the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. This indicated that oxidized diamond significantly supported the Cr2O3-loaded catalyst in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 in the presence of CO2.
Figure 3 Dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2 or Ar over various Cr2O3-loaded catalysts. Reaction conditions are the same as those shown in Figure 2:  C2H4 yield under CO2 flow/C2H4 yield under Ar flow.
3.4. Effect of Temperature on the Dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the Presence and Absence of CO2 over Oxidized Diamond-Supported Cr2O3 Catalyst. Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of catalytic activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence and the absence of CO2. C2H4 yields in the noncatalytic runs did not depend on atmosphere. In the presence of CO2 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, C2H4 yields increased remarkably with increasing reaction temperature, and a 27.4% C2H4 yield was obtained at 973 K. In contrast, C2H4 yield in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing reaction temperature, and above 948 K the same yield as that of the uncatalyzed run was obtained. In the absence of CO2, this inverse relation, i.e., the decrease the C2H4 yield with an increase in the reaction temperature, is probably caused by rapid carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. CO was detected over the catalyst during dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2. In addition, CO was formed during the reaction between CO2 and used catalyst (oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst) after the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the absence of CO2. Therefore, in the presence of CO2, the elimination of deposited carbon (reaction 5) may be a possible case of the promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of C2H6.

Figure 5 shows effect of the Cr2O3-loading level on C2H4 yield in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 under CO2 atmosphere. The highest C2H4 yield (23.8%) was obtained at 2.5 wt % Cr2O3, and C2H4 yield remained constant over a Cr2O3-loading level of 1.0−7.5 wt %, at a reaction temperature of 923 K.

3.5. Effect of Space Velocity on the Dehydrogenation of C2H6 over Oxidized Diamond-Supported Cr2O3 Catalyst. To obtain more detailed information regarding the role of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, the space velocity was varied by increasing the feed rate at a reaction temperature of 923 K. Figure 6 shows the effect of space velocity on the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. In the presence of CO2, C2H6 conversion and C2H4 yield decreased with increasing space velocity. In contrast, C2H4 selectivity increased. Selectivity of CH4 which was produced by hydrocracking of C2H6 and C2H4 decreased with increasing space velocity. Probably a secondary reaction of C2H6 or C2H4, such as hydrocracking, decreased. Under a CO2 atmosphere, the yield of C2H4 on the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst did not significantly decrease even at a high space velocity.
Figure 6 Effect of space velocity on the C2H6 conversion, and C2H4 yield and selectivity over oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. Reaction conditions:  temperature:  923 K, catalyst = 200 mg, loading level of Cr = 2.5 wt %, C2H6:CO2 = 1:5.
Figure 7 shows the effect of apparent contact time (1/SV) on C2H6 conversion over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. Instead of reaction rates, C2H6 conversion at the initial stage was used to evaluate reaction rates. The good linear relation between the natural logarithms of conversion against the inverse of SV clearly shows that the reaction is approximately first-order to C2H6. In this relation CO2, contact time was changed simultaneously; thus, the reaction rate evaluated involves the effect of reaction order against CO2. Since the reaction was carried out in excess CO2 (CO2/C2H6 = 5), the effect of CO2 on the reaction rates was not seen, indicating that reaction order to CO2 is nearly zero.
Figure 7 Effect of contact time on C2H6 conversion over oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst.
Figure 8 shows Arrhenius plots of the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2. The apparent activation energy over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst is ca. 66 kJ/mol and is much lower than that of the thermal reaction of 246 kJ/mol. The large advantage of catalytic dehydrogenation was semiquantitatively clarified. As shown in Figure 4, however, due to the rapid deactivation of the dehydrogenation of C2H6 under an Ar atmosphere, a comparison of activation energy between the run in CO2 and Ar could not be performed.
Figure 8 Arrhenius plots showing the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 over oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst.
3.6. Effect of CO2 and Steam Pressure on the Dehydrogenation of C2H6over Oxidized Diamond-Supported Cr2O3 Catalyst. Figure 9 shows the effect of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. C2H6 conversion and C2H4 yield markedly increased with the addition of a small portion of CO2 and increased gradually with further increases in the CO2 partial pressure. The C2H4 selectivity only slightly decreased with increases in the CO2 partial pressure. These results indicate that only a small amount of CO2 played an important role in increasing C2H4 yield over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. Figure 10 shows relationship between ln[C2H6 conversion] and ln[partial pressure of CO2] over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The good linear relation between ln[C2H6 conversion] and ln[partial pressure of CO2] was obtained. It was indicated that C2H6 conversion strongly depended upon partial pressure of CO2.

Reaction conditions:  temperature:  923 K, reaction time:  0.5 h, catalyst = 200 mg, loading level of Cr = 2.5 wt %, SV = 9000 h-1 mL/g-cat, C2H6: 5 mL/min, total flow rate = 30 mL/min.

In the dehydrogenation of C2H6 under a CO2 atmosphere, the roles of CO2 would be considered as follows:
In the dehydrogenation of C2H6 under a CO2 atmosphere, H2O was produced during the reaction (reaction 4). Cr2O3 has been reported to be a solid acid catalyst.29 Therefore, there is the possibility of carbon deposition on the Cr2O3-loaded catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethane. As mentioned above over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, CO2 acts to eliminate deposited carbon and to remove H2 from the reaction site, thus shifting the equilibrium favorably to the product side. Another possibility of the role of CO2 and formed H2O might be the modification the acidity or the chemical structure of the surface of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. A similar result was obtained using Ga2O3-loaded catalysts.24,25
In the dehydrogenation of C2H6 under CO2, water was produced during the reaction (reaction 3). Carbon deposition is one of major problems in the dehydrogenation of C2H6. The role of water in the dehydrogenation of ethane under CO2 would be considered as follows:
To obtain information regarding the effect of steam on the dehydrogenation of C2H6, steam was introduced in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence and in the absence of CO2. Using the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, C2H4 yield in the absence of CO2 was about 5.9%. C2H4 yield was markedly increased by the introduction of steam, and a product distribution similar to that in the run under CO2 was obtained (Table 2). These results suggest that steam produced in the presence of CO2 might also have promoted the dehydrogenation of C2H6. In this reaction, COx was detected and CH4 selectivity increased. Therefore, steam could eliminate deposited carbon on the catalyst's surface.

3.7. Effect of Time-on-Stream on the Dehydrogenation of C2H6 over Oxidized Diamond-Supported Cr2O3 Catalyst. Figure 11 shows effect of time-on-stream on the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. Both in the presence and in the absence of CO2 over this catalyst, C2H4 yields decreased markedly with increasing reaction time, due to carbon deposition. Using the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, deactivation of the catalyst in the presence and absence of CO2 without steam decreased from 22.5 to 11.5% and from 7.4 to 2.7% within 3 h, respectively.

To improve the stability of the catalyst's activity, steam was introduced in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence and in the absence of CO2. As described above, the introduction of steam together with CO2 improved the catalyst's stability over a long run.
3.8. Role of Oxidized Diamond and CO2 in the Dehydrogenation of C2H6over Cr2O3-Loaded Catalyst. To examine the promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, a pulsed reaction technique25,26 was employed to measure transient temperature changes in the catalyst beds.
Figure 12 shows the transient temperature responses of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst against a pulsed injection of C2H6 in the presence and the absence of CO2. The temperature at the front edge of the catalyst bed decreased with the introduction of the C2H6 pulse both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 923 K. In the absence of CO2, a large decrease in the temperature (c.a. 10 K:  3 mL pulse) of the front edge of the catalyst bed was observed as compared to the temperature drop in the presence of CO2. Observation of the catalyst-bed temperature by means of injecting a pulse of reactants might provide detailed information regarding the reaction being taking place on the catalyst's surface. Both reactions 1 and 3 are endothermic reactions, the value of ΔH of both reactions are also almost the same. Reaction 1 is more endothermic than reaction 3. The temperature drop in the catalyst bed might have indicated that the advantage of the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2 is much larger than that in the absence of CO2. In the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4, the advantages in using CO2 instead of Ar (without CO2) would be expressed on the basis of thermodynamic considerations.

To determine the types of deposited carbons during the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence and absence of CO2 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, used catalysts were examined using Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra of the used oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalysts in the presence and the absence of CO2 are shown in Figure 13. Two peaks were observed for the spectra of deposited carbon both in the presence and the absence of CO2:  one appears around 1330 cm,-1 and the other, at 1600 cm-1. The peak at 1330 cm-1 is ascribed to diamond. In addition, the peak at 1600 cm-1 was assigned to the in-plane carbon−carbon stretching vibration of graphite layers.30 It is considered that deposited carbons both in the presence and absence of CO2 might be same types.

The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst might be considered as follows:  in the Ga2O3 catalyst, a visible amount of carbon was deposited;25 however, visible carbon deposition was not observed over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. CO was detected at nearly twice the amount of C2H4 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst during the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2. One possible cause of this increased dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 might be a utilization of CO2 as oxidant for the dehydrogenation of C2H6. A second possibility would be the elimination of deposited carbon.
In the XRD patterns of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, Cr2O3 was observed both in the presence and absence of CO2 for the fresh and used catalysts. However, XPS analyses revealed that the binding energy of the chromium species of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst reacted at 923 K in the presence of CO2 shifted to a slightly higher binding energy than that of fresh catalyst or that reacted at 923 K in the presence of Ar (Figure 14). This result could show the oxidation of chromium oxide to maintain a higher-oxidation state. Wang et al. investigated the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst and, on the basis of the results of XPS analyses, found Cr3+ and Cr6+ coexist on the catalyst's surface. They proposed that the redox property played an important role in dehydrogenation in the presence of the CO2.19 We consider that maintaining a higher-oxidation state of the chromium species might be an important factor indicating high catalytic activities for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2.
Figure 14 X-ray photoelectron spectra of oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. Reaction conditions:  loading level of Cr = 7.5 wt %, (a) fresh, (b) after reaction with CO2 flow, (c) after reaction with Ar flow.
Figure 15 shows diffuse reflectance FT-IR spectra of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. After the reaction in the absence of CO2, the spectra from 1650 to 1850 cm-1 and at 1150−1250 cm-1 which were ascribed to CO and C−O−C stretching vibrations decreased compared with those in the presence of CO2. From these results, it is suggested that CO2 also played an important role in maintaining the oxygen species on the diamond surface. To obtain a high C2H4 yield in the dehydrogenation of C2H6, it would be necessary to keep both the highly oxidized state of chromium species and the presence of oxygen species on diamond surface.
Figure 15 Diffuse reflectance FT-IR spectra of oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. Reaction conditions:  temperature:  923 K, C2H6:CO2 (Ar) = 5:25 (mL/min), catalyst = 200 mg, loading level of Cr = 7.5 wt %, SV = 9000 h-1 mL/g-cat.
Scheme 1 shows the most plausible interpretation of such a synergism between Cr2O3 and oxidized diamond regarding the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2. To produce C2H4, Cr2O3 or a higher-oxidation state of chromium oxides are required. If chromium oxides are dispersed on the oxidized diamond surface, the chromium oxides might stabilize and become difficult to reduce. Even if the chromium oxides are reduced with C2H6 or H2, they will be oxidized by CO2 or oxygen species of the diamond surface. The threshold loading level of Cr2O3 on oxidized diamond might be ca. 1.25−2.5 wt %. In the case of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, the threshold level would be considered based on the total amount of oxygen species on the diamond surface. The oxygen species on the oxidized diamond surface were supplied from CO2 (Scheme 2). Such a mutual promotion effect on chromium oxide phase formation is believed to be the reason for the observed apparent synergism or promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of C2H6.

4. Conclusions
Among Cr2O3 loaded-catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest C2H4 yield for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2. C2H4 yields over this catalyst increased with increasing CO2 partial pressure. To maintain catalytic activity, steam which was produced in the presence of CO2 also played an important role in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the catalyst.
From the results of XRD and XPS, to obtain a high C2H4 yield in the dehydrogenation of C2H6, it was suggested that a higher-oxidation state of chromium species might be required. From the result of FT-IR, the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface would also play the important role for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 in the presence of CO2 using Cr2O3-loaded oxidized diamond catalyst.
The role of CO2 for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 on the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst might be to eliminate deposited carbon of catalyst surface. Furthermore, to maintain the higher-oxidation state of the chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface, CO2 would be necessary.
