Abstract
Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of dibenzothiophene (DBT) over laboratory synthesized bulk MoS2 catalysts using
batch microautoclave reactor was studied. Inﬂuence of H2S (wide range level) on the DBT HDS activity and selectivity
was investigated. In general, H2S was found to inhibit the direct desulfurization route that leads to biphenyl regardless
the catalyst applied. However, the hydrogenation pathway which mainly produces phenylcyclohexane inferred to be
either uninhibited or even more interestingly highly promoted by the presence of H2S depending on the catalyst nature.
The ultimate sum impact of H2S on the catalytic activity shows two extremes, inhibition and promotion. Mechanism of
H2S eﬀect is proposed.

1. Introduction
Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) currently ranks in
importance with other large-scale petroleum reﬁn-
ing processes as the legislations for protecting the
global environment becomes more strict towards
the conversion level of sulfur to be even more than
95% especially in the developed countries. The
hydrodesulfurization process is much aﬀected by
other partners that presumably compete on the
same catalytic active sites [1–5]. H2S is among the
well-known inhibitors of this process. Actually, it is
unavoidable inhibitor in HDS because so far it is
the by-product of these reactions. There is almost a
convention in the literature about the retardation
eﬀect of H2S on HDS reactions of real feed and
model sulfur compounds as well [1,4–10]. These
investigations were focused on supported NiMo
and/or CoMo catalysts. It is believed that for such
catalysts H2S is required to maintain the catalysts
sulﬁdes form rather than oxides.

alumina and carbon by presence of H2S has been
reported in our previous work [5]. This study em-
ploys model polyaromatic sulfur compounds, like
dibenzothiophene or 4,6-dimethyldibenzothioph-
ene, which represent the main refractory sulfur
species in the petroleum feedstocks. HDS reactions
are well known to proceed via two parallel path-
ways, the hydrogenation and the direct desulfur-
ization routes. Kinetic of having this kind of
parallel and consecutive reactions is the leading
point of considering two kinds of active sites for
these reactions. It was shown that carbon sup-
ported CoMo catalysts deactivated much more
than when alumina was used. Furthermore, H2S
was found to not only aﬀect the overall catalytic
activity of HDS but also the relative importance of
the reaction routes contribution arises from such
parallel and consecutive reactions. In general, it
was demonstrated that H2S inhibits to some extent
proceeding the HDS reaction through the direct
desulfurization route but has almost no inﬂuence
on the hydrogenation pathway.
While most studies on inhibition of HDS reac-
tions mainly used supported CoMo or NiMo cat-
alysts in the investigations, little attention has been
paid, however, to the inhibition eﬀect on the bulk
transition metal sulﬁdes catalysts [11]. This is
probably due to the low HDS activity trend ex-
hibited by the bulk species in comparison the
corresponding supported phase. However, the in-
hibition experiments may put some clues on the
catalytic active sites, which is the breakthrough of
developing active catalysts.
In this study, the eﬀect of H2S on the HDS
activity of DBT over two representative bulk
MoS2 catalysts was investigated. The study ad-
dresses the possible dual character behavior of H2S
depending on the nature of the synthesized MoS2
catalysts.
2. Experimental section
Two unsupported MoS2, AM and AC, catalysts
were prepared starting from two diﬀerent precur-
sors, ammonium heptamolybdate, (NH4)6Mo7O24 
4H2O) and molybdenum acetylacetonate, MoO2
(C5H7O2)2. Detailed preparation description was
given elsewhere [12]. Brieﬂy, the starting precursor
was loaded on silica tube reactor and was heat an-
nealed at 800 and 400 C with a continuous ﬂow of
10% (v/v) H2S/H2 gas mixture for ammonium
heptamolybdate and molybdenum acetylacetonate,
respectively. These treatments manipulation was
inferred to obtain quantitatively the MoS2 phase
structure. The samples then ﬂushed by helium gas
for about 30 min and thereafter cooled to ambient
temperature. The MoS2 obtained was conducting
for grinding using the media-agitating mill using a
media of zerconia beads (1 mm diameter) and ro-
tation speed of 3000 rpm. AM-G and AC-G are the
ultimate species that will be forward for catalytic
examination.
All MoS2 obtained were characterized by X-ray
powder diﬀraction (Rigaku Diﬀractometer; Cu-Ka
radiation (k ¼ 1:54056 
A). The patterns illustrate
scans that are characteristic to MoS2 structure but
with diﬀerent crystallinity. Particle sizes of 4 and
1.9 nm for AM-G and AC-G were estimated from
the width of line broadening at Miller index peak
of (0 0 2), respectively. The forthcoming study is
the detailed description of the structural charac-
teristics of these species with TEM, SEM and
other tools.
Catalytic activity was performed by the aid of
sampler magnetic stirrer microautoclave batch re-
actor of 100 ml. By using this reactor, useful in-
formation such as rate constants and selectivity can
be obtained by following the reaction transforma-
tion fraction as a function of time. A typical run
was as follows: The reactor charged with 0.1–0.2 g
catalyst and 10 g, 1 wt.% DBT in decane and for
some runs copper powder was added as a scrubber
of the self-produced H2S during reaction. Then the
reactor was purged 5 times by H2 for replacing the
atmosphere. A wide variety of H2S concentration in
the feed was adjusted from either inserting sulfur
powder or a certain pressure of 10% (v/v) H2S/H2
gas mixtures. All the investigated HDS reaction
runs were adjusted to perform at a ﬁxed conditions
of 340 C and 3 MPa H2. The reaction content was
analyzed and quantiﬁed with time intervals so that
to cover the conversion level of HDS of DBT to be
over than 95% with the aid of GC-FID, Agilent HP
6890. The qualitative investigation was accom-
plished with GC-MS, HP 5970.

3. Results
The products detected in HDS of DBT over
the two bulk MoS2 catalysts, AM-G and AC-G,
were inferred to be biphenyl (BP), phenylcyclo-
hexane (PC) and hydrogenated dibenzothiophene
(H4-DBT), consistent with literature. In addition,
some very traces of hydrocracked species like
1-methylnaphthalene and alkylbenzene were also
observed. The reaction scheme could be suggested
to consist of two independent routes, hydroge-
nation and direct desulfurization as convention-
ally found in the literature [2,3,6]. The activity
results of HDS of DBT over these two catalysts
were found to follow the kinetics of pseudo-ﬁrst-
order reaction.
3.1. H2S as promoter
Fig. 1 shows the eﬀect of H2S self-produced and
the externally added H2S to the reaction on the
catalytic activity of HDS of DBT over AM-G
catalyst. It is interesting and surprising to note the
obvious enhancement in catalytic activity with the
addition of H2S to more than 4 times its standard
value (the run with adding copper to avoid the
eﬀect of the self-produced H2S during reaction).
After the sharp promotion of activity on the early
stages of presence of H2S, adding further concen-
tration of H2S exhibits no more impact on the
catalytic activity even at presence of relatively high
level. The stable activity plateau of HDS of DBT
with adding H2S can be clearly seen from Fig. 1.
Figs. 2 and 3 give an example describing the in-
ﬂuence of H2S presence and/or absence in the re-
action feed on the main product distributions for
HDS of DBT. One can see that the main pro-
nounced enhancement in activity is correlated to
the signiﬁcant increase of the hydrogenation route
product (PC) while the direct desulfurization route
(BP) was signiﬁcantly retarded.
One may suspect about this catalyst of being
partially oxidized during grinding and conse-
quently sulﬁdation during reaction by H2S is a

possible explanation of these results. To rule out
this possibility, we have further sulﬁded AM-G
catalyst after grinding with 10% (v/v) H2S/H2 gas
mixtures at 400 C and then this freshly sulﬁded
catalyst was examined directly for the eﬀect of H2S
on HDS of DBT. The results are included to Fig. 1
and the enhancement in HDS activity can easily be
recognized. Thus, H2S does act as promoter for
the hydrogenation route and on the other hand as
inhibitor for the direct desulfurization pathway.
The ultimate sum eﬀect on the overall reaction
kinetics is the obvious enhancement in the catalytic
activity but mainly due to the promotion occurred
in the hydrogenation route.
3.2. H2S as inhibitor
Fig. 4 represents the inhibition eﬀect caused by
H2S for HDS of DBT over AC-G catalyst. There is
only slight inhibition by the self-produced H2S.
However, for more level added of H2S, a reduction
of almost two times in the HDS activity can be
observed. Examples of the reﬂection of presence of
H2S on the product selectivity of HDS of DBT
over AC-G catalyst are depicted in Figs. 5 and 6
for hydrogenation (PC) and direct desulfurization
(BP) routes of DBT, respectively. It is interesting
to note that while H2S acts as promoter for the
hydrogenation route of DBT HDS over AM-G as
seen previously in Fig. 2 it has almost no eﬀect on
this route when catalyst AC-G was applied. In
addition and online with what was found for the
direct desulfurization route for AM-G catalyst,
H2S inhibits this route for HDS of DBT over AC-
G catalyst but with diﬀerent extent.
4. Discussion
Table 1 shows the eﬀect of H2S on the selec-
tivity behavior of HDS of DBT through putting
the above-mentioned results in easily understand-
able, analytical and representative way.
The results shown so far demonstrate two ex-
tremes for the inﬂuence of H2S on the HDS cata-

lytic activity, i.e., promotion of overall activity of
AM-G and reduction of HDS activity for AC-G
catalysts. It is to conclude that H2S always sub-
stantially inhibits the direct desulfurization route
for HDS of DBT regardless the catalysts back-
ground and the reaction conditions, whereas, for
the hydrogenation route H2S either promote or
almost shows no eﬀect which seems to be depen-
dent on the catalyst morphology.
5. Proposed mechanism for H2S eﬀect
Sulfur anion vacancies have for a long time
been considered to be active sites for HDS [1,2]. In
view of this, it seems logical to suggest the at-
tacking of H2S molecule in order to ﬁll up these
coordinately unsaturated sites. Proposed scheme is
depicted in Fig. 7. This will create new sites that
are mainly from the geometry point of view can
proceeds hydrogenation. Reasonably, not all the
newly created sites are catalytically active, the only
sites which locate to ﬁt the adsorption requirement
of the substrate probably at the edges of the MoS2
phase, is suggested to be usable. The dissociation
of hydrogen may lead to ASH and @SH2 groups.
@SH2 group is supposed to forward hydrogena-
tion while ASH may help doing direct desulfur-
ization and in some circumstances hydrogenation
in which the location geometry of the substrate is a
concerned factor. The identity of the active sites
and the overall number of them are to be consid-
ered factors in the activity promotion.
Based on the mechanism, as the H2S concen-
tration increased the @SH2 active site numbers
also increased and consequently, the ASH active
site numbers decreased. This would be expected,
based on the proposed mechanism, to forward to
more extent the hydrogenation route in the HDS
of the refractory sulfur compounds. The @SH2
functional active site could likely be present even
at very low level of H2S but merely in low con-
centration that leads to the preliminary contribu-
tion in hydrogenation at low level of H2S.
Then, the question arises how H2S promotes
HDS, as the case in AM-G catalyst and in contrast
inhibits the HDS reaction over AC-G and Mo-
supported catalysts whether it is promoted by Ni
or Co or un-promoted, Table 1. Speculation on
the HDS reaction selectivity may put some high-
lights on this behavior. The main inhibition takes
place in the direct desulfurization route, while the

hydrogenation either remains stable or signiﬁ-
cantly promoted. It can be visualized in view of the
above-mentioned mechanism the shift down in
number of direct desulfurization sites. This is due
to the equilibrium shown in step 1 in the mecha-
nism scheme. However, the increase of hydroge-
nation sites has to be looked in view that not all of
them posses a catalytic eﬃciency. Only the sites
that ﬁt the geometry and stability factors will take
care the hydrogenation reactions. Thus, a geome-
try concern [13–17] of the newly created active sites
is a signiﬁcant driving force for making their
beneﬁciary. In hydrogenation, ﬂat mode adsorp-
tion through p-complexation of the aromatic ring
is to be occurred. The nature of the active sites and
its activity is likely being dependent on the particle
size. Usually, 1–3 layers of MoS2 were prescribed
to be located on the support surface. It is well
known that the forces holding these stacked layers
are the van der Waals forces. Non-uniform hex-
agonal structure that leads to the modiﬁcation of
the surface morphology of MoS2 is suggested.
Therefore, it is the morphological location nature
of the sites that ruled its activity. It is to state that
H2S creates active sites and it is probably a matter
of geometry not chemically whether these sites are
available to the substrate. However, more studies
are needed to clarify this issue.
6. Conclusion
In essence, the activity and usability of the newly
created active sites are highly aﬀected by their ge-
ometry that allows the suitable accommodation
feasibility of the substrate. Although H2S creates
new active sites some of them may be excluded from
the contribution in the hydrogenation reaction
most probably due to the steric geometry hindrance
factor. Therefore, for AM-G catalyst the majority
of the newly created active sites by H2S seem to
have catalytic beneﬁciary. On the other hand, in
case of AC-G and presumably for supported NiMo
and/or CoMo catalysts as well the majority of these
new sites are no longer been usable for hydroge-
nation reaction probably due to the steric restric-
tion of geometrical factor. The sum impact of H2S
on AM-G catalyst is increasing the hydrogenation
activity, which leads to the increase of overall HDS
activity. In addition H2S has no signiﬁcant increase
in hydrogenation activity over AC-G and the sum
result is decreasing the overall HDS activity. Re-
sults suggest the morphology nature of the created
active sites by H2S and not the chemical nature that
rule the precise control of their contribution on the
HDS reaction.
