ABSTRACT 
A pulsed isotope exchange technique was applied to study the oxygen scrambling 
activity of polycrystalline calcium oxide under temperatures and pressures relevant 
for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). Oxygen exchange was observed above 
400°C. The onset was attributed to the removal of impurities on the catalyst surface. 
By trapping impurities in the gas feed, the scrambling could already be observed at 
room temperature. An activation energy of 80 kJ/mol was determined for the oxygen 
scrambling of O2 on the surface of polycrystalline CaO powder in absence of other 
gases. Presence of water and carbon dioxide shift the onset of the reaction to higher 
temperatures and increase the activation energy significantly to 110 kJ/mol and 
150 kJ/mol, respectively. The OCM activity could be directly linked to the oxygen 
scrambling activity of the material in pulsed OCM operation. It is proposed that the 
same sites are responsible for oxygen scrambling and OCM reaction and that the 
rate is dictated by desorption of CO2 and H2O. The high reaction temperatures in 
OCM in case of CaO are only required to regenerate the active sites, which may 
apply to basic OCM catalysts in general. In-situ Raman and thermogravimetric 
experiments verified the formation of a bulk calcite phase below 750°C, which is 
inactive in OCM and oxygen scrambling. Above 750°C no surface oxygen species or 
adsorbates were found by Raman spectroscopy suggesting that only surface defects 
are responsible for catalytic activity of CaO.

1. INTRODUCTION 
With methane being one of the most abundant carbon sources, the transformation 
into more valuable compounds is of high economic interest.1,2 Several options to 
directly convert methane towards higher hydrocarbons have been investigated,3 one 
of those being the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), first described in the 80's.4 
In the presence of oxygen, methane is converted to ethane and ethylene. 
Non-reducible oxides such as alkaline earth oxides, often in combination with rare 
earth oxides, have been studied as promising OCM catalysts. The catalytic 
performance of such materials appeared to correlate with their basic strength,5,6 
however, involving limitations due to stable carbonate formation. In case of alkaline 
earth oxides, CaO is the most promising candidate, with MgO being less basic, and 
SrO and BaO forming stable carbonates under reaction conditions. 
The oxidative coupling of methane requires the activation of C-H bonds in the 
methane molecule as well as the oxygen-oxygen bond in the O2 molecule. A widely 
accepted reaction mechanism involves methyl radicals formed by hydrogen 
abstraction from methane on the catalyst surface, which combine afterwards in the 
gas phase giving ethane. The reaction has been suggested to take place at O- 
centers, which can be generated by introducing alkali metal ions into alkaline earth 
oxides, such as Li, forming [Li+O-] centers.7 However, DFT calculations indicated 
thermodynamic instability of such centers in a large pressure and temperature 
window, albeit [Li+O-] centers were not excluded to be formed under non-equilibrium 
conditions.8 
The formation of activated oxygen species on the surface of "pure" alkaline earth 
oxides has been often correlated to the presence of dopants such as alkali metal ions 
or transition metal ions present in the material due to intended addition or as

impurities.9 In EPR studies on "pure" CaO, Na was found to be involved in the 
formation of peroxide species at step sites.10 Similarly, surface defects might be 
important on “pure” alkaline earth oxides. A structure reactivity correlation indicated 
atomic step sites to be the active centers on MgO catalysts.11  
The oxidative coupling of methane is far away from industrial implementation due to 
an apparent yield barrier for C2 products of about 30% that has yet to be 
surpassed.12 However, the presence of oxygen in the gas phase under reaction 
conditions renders it difficult to achieve high selectivity. The released methyl radicals 
can not only combine, but also react with gaseous oxygen to form methyl peroxy 
radicals, which are considered as precursors for undesired oxidation products such 
as CO and CO2.13 In general, oxygen activation on the surface and the intermediate 
appearance of activated oxygen species may have a major impact on selectivity.14 In 
case of CaO, the introduction of anionic vacancies by the addition of Li+ ions into the 
lattice can improve the oxygen dissociation.15 Even though extensive studies have 
been made, the oxygen activation on the catalyst surface is still under debate.3,16  
Another aspect is the interaction of the byproduct water and side products such as 
carbon dioxide with the catalyst and the influence of the formation of surface 
carbonates and hydroxides on oxygen activation. Conflicting results were found 
concerning the impact of carbon dioxide on the catalytic performance, varying from 
no impact at all,17,18 to a negative impact on activity18 or a beneficial effect on 
selectivity19 and even activity.20 The negative effect on activity is mostly explained by 
stable carbonate formation, which can be neglected at temperatures far above the 
decomposition temperature that applies to the temperature range in which OCM is 
usually performed on MgO- and CaO-based systems. The increased selectivity in 
some cases is attributed to CO2 blocking unselective oxidation sites,19 but lacking 
definitive proof so far.

In fundamental studies on thin CaO films grown on molybdenum single crystal 
supports oxygen adsorption was studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in 
ultra-high vacuum (UHV) verified by theoretical calculations.21 The adsorption energy 
for oxygen on a pristine CaO surface was found to be low with 13 kJ/mol and the 
dissociation barrier was determined to be 110 kJ/mol. The barrier was reduced 
significantly in presence of high valence dopants in the sub-surface of the CaO film. 
The present study aims at linking model studies under UHV conditions with high-
performance catalysis in fixed bed reactors by investigating “pure” polycrystalline 
CaO as model system in powder form. Oxygen activation and OCM are 
comparatively studied at normal pressure and over a wide temperature range 
revealing analogies of the two processes. The impact of surface hydroxyl groups and 
carbonate species on reactivity will be discussed as well.

2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 
Synthesis. Calcium carbonate was prepared as a calcium oxide precursor for the 
measurements by the following co-precipitation procedure. A 10.7 wt% calcium 
nitrate solution (Ca(NO3)2x4H2O, Fisher Scientific analytical reagent grade, dissolved 
in appropriate amount of millipore water) and a 8.03 wt% ammonium carbonate 
solution ((NH4)2CO3, Roth, p.a., dissolved in appropriate amount of millipore water) 
were simultaneously added over a period of one hour to a 0.74 wt% ammonium 
carbonate solution at 30°C under constant stirring using an automated LabMax® 
reactor (Mettler Toledo). The product was aged in the solution, filtered, washed 
multiple times with millipore water and dried at 80°C for 24 h. For catalytic 
measurements the resulting powder was pressed at 200 bar, crushed and sieved to 
yield a sieve fraction of 200-300 µm (internal catalyst ID 24254 for catalysis, thermal 
analysis and elemental analysis, 25763 for ICP, isotopic scrambling and Raman). 
Elemental Analysis. ICP-OES measurements were carried out using a Varian 
ICP-OES 715 ES. For sample preparation 500 mg calcium carbonate were dissolved 
with 3 ml 69% HNO3 (ROTIPURAN® Supra ROTH) and diluted to a total volume of 
15 ml with water (VWR, ultrapure, HPLC grade). For calibration, a dilution series of 
an ICP standard from Sigma-Aldrich was prepared containing 33 elements of the 
main and first transition metal group elements (Periodic table mix 1 for ICP, 
TraceCERT®). The main impurity was found to be Sr with 150 ppm. Na was found to 
be below the detection limit of 50 ppm. 
Nitrogen adsorption. Surface area determination was carried out using an 
Autosorb® iQ by Quantachrome® Instruments, performing an 11 point BET surface 
area analysis. The sample was activated in a 4 mm inner diameter quartz tube 
reactor with flowing air (40 ml/min) at 900°C for 6 h applying a heating rate of

5 °C/min. After activation, the feed gas was switched to helium at 900°C and cooled 
down to room temperature. The sample was sealed inside the reactor using a 
methane-oxygen torch, transferred into a glove box and afterwards filled into the 
measuring cell.  
Catalytic Tests. The catalytic tests in constant as well as pulsed feed were carried 
out in a 8 mm inner diameter quartz tube reactor equipped with an internal 
thermocouple positioned inside an inner quartz tube of 2 mm outer diameter. For the 
tests, 100 mg calcium carbonate (200-300 µm) were diluted in 1400 mg of silicon 
carbide (300-400 µm). Prior to the catalytic tests, the carbonate was decomposed at 
850°C for 6 h in synthetic air (30 ml/min). In constant feed mode a gas composition of 
6:1:3, He:O2:CH4 was mixed using Bronkhorst mass flow controllers. In the pulsed 
mode the feed was set to 9:1, He:O2 and conducted through a pneumatic 6-port 
diaphragm valve by Valco VICI equipped with a 1 ml sample loop. Methane was 
pulsed every 10 min (every 20°C) applying this loop. The total gas flow was fixed at 
30 ml/min for each experiment. The products were quantitatively analyzed using a 
GAM 200 mass spectrometer. The conversion in case of constant feed mode was 
calculated by:

MYTHEN 1K position sensitive microstrip solid-state detector. For sample 
preparation the samples were crushed using a mortar. 
Thermogravimetric Analysis. The in situ thermogravimetric experiments were 
carried out using a DynTHERM magnetic suspension balance (Rubotherm). The 
effluent gases were qualitatively analyzed using a GAM 200 mass spectrometer. A 
more detailed description of the setup can be found elsewhere.22 For these 
experiments 500 mg of calcium carbonate (200-300 µm) were placed in the ceramic 
crucible and decomposed by heating in argon (500 ml/min) with 5 °C/min up to 
900°C. After complete conversion to calcium oxide (mass loss expected from 
MCaCO3 = 100.1 g/mol to MCaO = 56.1 g/mol), temperature and feed were varied. For 
OCM conditions a feed composition of (3:1:3, Ar:O2:CH4) was applied. For buoyancy 
correction a blank experiment was performed. It has to be noted, that under the 
investigated temperatures for OCM (>700°C) the conversion of oxygen was always 
100% due to metal parts inside the balance (e.g. thermocouples: stainless steel shell, 
suspension: Pt/Ir alloy). 
Raman. Raman spectroscopy was carried out using a TriVista TR557 spectrometer 
(S&I Spectroscopy & Imaging GmbH) equipped with a confocal Raman microscope. 
For in situ studies a Linkam CCR-1000 reactor stage was used coupled with a micro 
GC (Agilent). For the laser source a 532 nm laser was used applying a laser power of 
1.30 mW to exclude laser-induced damage. Resolution is dictated by the laser 
wavelength and grating used, in this case 600 grooves/mm, which yield a resolution 
of approximately 1 cm-1. Prior exposure to the feed, 10 mg of calcium carbonate 
(200-300 µm) were placed inside the in situ cell and activated in synthetic air 
(10 ml/min) at 900°C. A feed of 3:1:3, He:O2:CH4 (10 ml/min) was used and the 
temperatures were varied between 700°C and 800°C. It has to be noted that due to

heated metal parts inside the cell (e.g. thermocouples, heating system), the oxygen 
conversion above 700°C was almost 100%. 
Pulsed Isotope Exchange Experiments. The setup used in pulsed isotope 
exchange experiments resembles the setup used for temperature-programmed 
catalytic test measurements. A scheme of the apparatus is presented in the 
supporting information (Figure S1). To reduce the reactor volume, a 4 mm inner 
diameter quartz tube reactor was used with an external thermocouple. For the tests, 
50 mg of calcium carbonate (200-300 µm) diluted in 730 mg silicon carbide were 
placed in the reactor fixed with quartz wool. The carbonates were decomposed at 
900°C for one hour in synthetic air (80% He and 20% O2) prior to the experiments. 
For the pulsed isotope scrambling experiments a constant feed of synthetic air (20% 
O2 in He) was applied at 30 ml/min, for experiments with additional carbon dioxide 
20% CO2 were added replacing equal parts of the helium, for experiments containing 
water, the feed was conducted through a saturator adding ~4% water to the feed. 
The isotope was added using a pneumatic 6-port diaphragm valve equipped with a 
1 ml sample loop. The loop was evacuated multiple times using a vacuum pump and 
filled with 18O labeled synthetic air (20% 36O2 in N2, Westfalen) to 500 mbar. The 
effluent gases were analyzed using a GAM 200 mass spectrometer. It has to be 
noted, that the spectrometer was not calibrated for the isotopes. To calculate the 
18O-distribution xi,F, the mass spectrometer signals I were integrated and the 
response factors for all isotopes of the same chemical composition (such as: 
32O2,34O2,36O2 and 18H2O,20H2O and 44CO2, 46CO2, 48CO2) were assumed to be equal. 
Using F as the amount of exchanged oxygen (e.g. 1 in 46CO2 and 2 in 48CO2) in a 
chemical compound i (i: CO2, H2O, O2) and mi,F as the corresponding m/z value, the 
calculation was performed as follows:

of methane instead of 500 µl labeled air. The calculations for these experiments were 
similar to the pulsed temperature-programmed experiments. A stainless steel tube 
with 1/2" inner diameter was filled with 10 g of CaCO3, activated at 900°C for 24 h 
and installed prior to the quartz tube reactor to investigate the influence of impurities 
in the gas feed.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1 Oxygen Isotopic Scrambling 
To test the calcium oxide catalyst in terms of its capability to activate oxygen, pulsed 
oxygen exchange experiments were conducted (Figure 1). CaO was exposed to a 
constant 32O2 flow and pulses of 36O2 were applied at constant temperature. The 
18O-distribution in the outlet pulse gives direct information about the oxygen 
exchange activity of the tested material. A gas phase contribution due to the 
simultaneous presence of both, 32O2 and 36O2, as well as an activity of the inert 
material was excluded by a blank experiment with silicon carbide (Figure 1). Bulk 
contributions in this experiment cannot be analyzed, but can be neglected due to the 
omnipresence of 16O in the gas phase immediately regenerating exchanged oxygen 
atoms on the surface and the bulk diffusion being very slow compared to the surface 
reaction and therefore only weakly affecting the tailing of the outlet pulses.23 
An advantage of this method lies in its applicability. Since SSITKA experiments 
require a dead zone free reactor with optimized flow conditions to analyze the 
transients, the pulsed exchange can be applied in any standard catalysis test reactor. 
The amount of isotope needed is also minimized. A SSITKA method with reduced 
isotope usage has been reported before, but the transient analysis in this case is by 
far more challenging.24,25 Due to the avoidance of 18O diffusion into the bulk, an 
extensive regeneration between the pulses is not necessary, which is also an 
advantage compared to the temperature programmed isotopic exchange (TPIE) 
technique, where the isotope accumulates in the catalyst lattice during the 
experiment.26 In comparison to other pulsed techniques, such as temporal analysis of 
products (TAP),27 the constant oxygen partial pressure ensures no vacuum induced 
reduction that may falsify the obtained results. The isotope exchange with the

calcium oxide lattice has been found to be sensitive towards the pretreatment, such 
as reduction or oxidation, finding a pre-reduced surface more easily to exchange 
surface oxygen compared to the oxidized surface.23 
 
Figure 1: 18O distribution in O2 after dosing a pulse of 500 µl of labeled synthetic air 
(80% N2 and 20% 36O2) into 30 ml/min unlabeled synthetic air (80% He and 20% 
32O2) at temperatures between 50°C and 800°C over 27.7 mg CaO (25763) diluted in 
730 mg SiC (black symbols), with the additional upstream introduction of a 20 g CaO 
sacrificial column (blue symbols) and over 750 mg SiC without the column (green 
symbols). 
 
In the present experiments, CaO was activated in the reactor at 900°C in synthetic air 
prior to starting oxygen exchange. In Figure 1 (black symbols) the 18O distribution 
after oxygen scrambling on the activated calcium oxide at different temperatures in 
flowing oxygen is presented. Showing no activity at temperatures below 400°C, the 
catalyst becomes quite active at temperatures above 500°C. On magnesium oxides a 
similar behavior was observed before.28 It was concluded that the removal of surface 
OH by the release of H2 triggered the onset of the reactivity with molecular oxygen. 
Since the calcium oxide was dehydroxylated by activation prior to the oxygen

exchange experiments at 900°C, coverage with OH is not likely, however, OH groups 
might be re-formed due to reaction of CaO with traces of water in the feed. To get rid 
of any possibly remaining impurities in the gas supply, a column of 20 g CaO was 
introduced in front of the actual reactor in a subsequent experiment to trap all traces 
of impurities in the oxygen feed (for example H2O and/or CO2) as far as possible 
(blue data points in Figure 1). Now that impurities were removed, the onset of the 
oxygen exchange activity decreases down to a temperature of 50°C, suggesting that 
even very little amounts of surface hydroxide or carbonate are able to quench the 
oxygen exchange activity of calcium oxide completely. The apparent activation 
energy of 80 kJ/mol determined in this experiment is lower than the calculated 
dissociation barrier for oxygen on pristine flat CaO surfaces with 110 kJ/mol,21 but 
comparable to what was found for the double oxygen exchange on a pre-oxidized 
CaO surface with 74 kJ/mol before.23 
The ability of alkaline earth oxides such as MgO to activate oxygen and even 
exchanging a fraction of a monolayer with the gas phase is well known.29–31 Since the 
pristine flat calcium oxide surface should not be able to activate oxygen in absence of 
a reducing agent or dopant,21 the capability of irreducible oxides to activate oxygen is 
often attributed to the presence of trace amounts of dopants, such as transition 
metals or alkali metals.9 In case of alkali metal dopants, the oxygen exchange could 
be correlated down to 0.001 at% Na impurities in the used CaO catalyst. However, 
such low concentrations can hardly be avoided in catalyst synthesis. Here, a Na 
content of < 0.005 at% was determined, which was the detection limit of the applied 
analysis method.27 According to proposed mechanisms, the oxygen exchange 
involves O- species on the surface, forming an ozonide O3
- species with gas phase 
oxygen as an intermediate.29,30 O- species on the catalyst surface were assumed to 
be formed by the splitting of O2
2- acting as surface terminations on step sites.10

Those sites have also been related to the presence of Na ions in the vicinity creating 
a hole structure identified by EPR.32 In case of low Na-doped CaO, the presence of 
sodium influenced the ratio of kads/kdis reducing the coverage of the catalyst surface 
with molecular oxygen.27 A value of 89 kJ/mol was found for the adsorption, but for 
the dissociation a barrier of 249 kJ/mol was determined.27 
 
Figure 2: 18O distribution in outlet pulses after dosing a pulse of 500 µl of labeled 
synthetic air (80% N2 and 20% 36O2) over 27.7 mg CaO (25763) diluted in 730 mg 
SiC between 50°C and 800°C in a carbon dioxide containing feed (60% He, 20% O2, 
20% CO2, left) and with the addition of water (78% He, 18% O2 and 4% H2O, right). 
Hollow symbols represent experiments without the addition of CO2 or H2O. 
 
To investigate the influence of by- and side-products occurring in OCM feeds on the 
oxygen activation, water and carbon dioxide were co-fed (Figure 2). By the addition 
of carbon dioxide and thus stabilizing calcium carbonate, it becomes evident that the 
carbonate is not able to interact with gaseous oxygen in a manner of dissociating 
oxygen in order to induce a scrambling of the oxygen isotopes. Scrambling is only 
observed at temperatures at which the carbonate becomes thermodynamically 
unstable and decomposes (dashed line in Figure 2, left). A similar behavior was 
observed earlier for rare earth oxide catalysts in OCM investigated by TPIE.26

Carbonates were found to shift the onset of the isotopic oxygen exchange with the 
catalyst lattice to higher temperatures. It has to be noted that in this case primarily 
the impact of bulk properties such as oxygen diffusion was investigated. At 
temperatures above carbonate decomposition an oxygen exchange is observed and 
the 18O is found in oxygen as well as in carbon dioxide. Due to the higher abundance 
of 16O sources (20% in the synthetic air plus the 16O in the 20% carbon dioxide), the 
overall conversion of 36O2, assuming a statistical distribution, is expected to be higher 
in these experiments compared to oxygen exchange experiments in absence of CO2. 
It is known that scrambling of oxygen with carbon dioxide does not take place in the 
gas phase, even not at high temperatures.33 A mechanism for the oxygen exchange 
between C18O2 and CaO on well-ordered Ca16O films was recently reported.34 The 
exchange occurs even on defect-free CaO(001) planes due to rotation and other 
motions of the adsorbed carbonate. Monodentate isolated carbonate species are 
easily able to exchange oxygen atoms with the calcium oxide lattice, especially on 
monoatomic step and corner sites, where the intrinsic barrier for oxygen scrambling 
is reduced to 80 kJ/mol and 27 kJ/mol, respectively.34 Finding an almost statistical 
distribution of the 18O among the oxygen as well the carbon dioxide in the present 
experiment, it can be assumed that the scrambling of oxygen and carbon dioxide 
takes place on similar surface sites, which in both cases can be step sites on the 
catalyst surface. The activation energy in this case was determined to be much 
higher compared to the theoretical value with 150 kJ/mol, indicating that not the 
scrambling, but the CO2 release from the surface might be rate determining. 
The addition of water induces a similar behavior and shifts the oxygen scrambling 
also to higher temperatures, which proves that OH compensated sites and 
hydroxides are not or less able to dissociate oxygen (Figure 2, right). An isotope 
exchange with the water is also observed, but to lower extent compared to CO2. The

activation energy in this case was found to be slightly elevated compared to the pure 
oxygen experiments with about 110 kJ/mol. The results also indicate that water 
interacts with the active sites even above the hydroxide decomposition temperature. 
In summary, oxygen activation was studied applying oxygen scrambling experiments 
on calcium oxide. It becomes apparent that by- and side-products of the OCM 
reaction, such as CO2 and water, act as poisons for the sites active towards oxygen 
activation on calcium oxide catalysts. 
3.2 Temperature-Programmed Coupling of Methane 
 
Figure 3: Temperature programmed reaction over 55 mg CaO (24254) in 1400 mg 
SiC with 30 ml/min gas feed and a heating rate of 5 °C/min under continuous 
operation (left) with 6:3:1, He:CH4:O2 and pulsed operation (right) with 9:1, He:O2 and 
1 ml CH4 pulse every 10 minutes. 
 
Temperature-programmed oxidative coupling of methane on CaO is presented in 
Figure 3 (left). With the initial activity observed at roughly 600°C, the onset 
temperature is slightly higher compared to the findings for oxygen scrambling activity. 
Upon heating, the conversion rises as expected and an increased product formation 
is observed. The increased CO2 release between 700°C and 750°C hardly affects the 
formation of the other products (such as CO, C2H6, or C2H4) or the conversion of

methane, meaning CO2 formed at lower temperatures and fixed in form of carbonates 
on the catalyst surface is being released at the higher temperatures to a large extent 
by decomposition of carbonates, but it does not (or hardly) affect the activity of the 
catalyst by site blocking. Increasing the temperature above 750°C, the formation of 
carbon dioxide and carbon oxide increases less in favor of the formation of C2 
products, mainly C2H4. An explanation for this behavior can be the decreased 
abundance of oxygen in the gas phase due to the high conversion, reducing the 
over-oxidation of the formed C2-hydrocarbons. 
Conducting the experiment in a pulsed mode by introducing methane to a feed 
consisting of oxygen and helium, major differences can be found in the reactivity 
(Figure 3, right). One difference is the reduced onset temperature of the reaction, 
slightly above 500°C, very well in agreement with the onset of the oxygen scrambling 
activity (Figure 1). Another difference is the omission of the CO2 release compared to 
the continuous flow experiment. Due to the higher ratio of oxygen to methane, higher 
overall conversions were obtained. The reduced C2-product formation can also be 
explained by the higher abundance of oxygen in the gas phase. Assuming the widely 
accepted mechanism involving methyl radicals being released to the gas phase and 
combining to ethane,7 the collision of the radicals with oxygen becomes more likely in 
an oxygen-rich atmosphere, favoring the unselective gas phase reactions leading to 
CO and CO2.35

700°C (bottom) and 760°C (top) over 55 mg CaO (24254) in 1400 mg SiC. 
 
The accordance of the onset temperatures in pulsed OCM reaction (Figure 3, right) 
and oxygen scrambling activity (Figure 1), but the shifted onset temperature of OCM 
in the continuous experiment (Figure 3, left) can be explained by the permanent 
presence of reaction products in the gas phase in the continuous experiment. While 
in the constant feed mode water and carbon dioxide are constantly present to poison 
the active sites, in the pulsed feed mode only oxygen and helium are present 
between the pulses cleaning the catalyst surface at high temperatures. Each pulse of 
methane comes in contact with a pre-purified surface, whereas in the constant feed 
mode the surface is always contaminated by the reaction products. The CO2 release 
is also facilitated due to the reduced CO2 partial pressure in the gas phase in the 
pulsed mode not stabilizing the carbonate formation and thus preventing a CO2

accumulation in the system. Having a closer look at the time-resolved pulses (Figure 
4), the carbon dioxide release is strongly delayed compared to the other gases, 
indicated by a pronounced tailing of the corresponding peak. At low temperatures 
(700°C), the tailing of the peak is quite significant, proving that under steady state 
condition an accumulation of CO2 on the catalyst has to be assumed. But even at 
temperatures above 750°C, the release of CO2 is slightly delayed compared to the 
methane peak, indicating a strong CO2-surface interaction and a possible formation 
of surface carbonate species. 
3.3 In Situ Catalyst Characterization 
To investigate influences of adsorbates, carbonate or hydroxide formation, in situ 
thermogravimetric experiments as well as in situ Raman measurements were 
conducted. In both experiments the oxygen conversion approaches almost 100% and 
the selectivity towards C2-products is negligible. Therefore, these experiments 
particularly provide information regarding the interaction of by- and side-products of 
the OCM reaction with the catalyst material.

and 700°C and B) XRD analysis of spent catalyst after 30 h on stream at 720°C in

Mass changes of CaO at temperatures between 700°C and 800°C in the presence of 
methane combustions gases are presented in Figure 5A. The mass of the catalyst 
increases abruptly during initial heating when the onset temperature of OCM reaction 
is reached, but decreases again during holding at a reaction temperature of 800°C. 
Then, the reaction temperature was stepwise decreased. Reducing the temperature 
from 750°C to 740°C, an increase in the catalyst mass can be observed, which is 
enhanced by further reducing the temperature to 730°C. A direct conversion from 
CaO to CaCO3 is known to take place at these temperatures, whereas at low 
temperatures the process is slow and is enhanced by the presence of water, first 
forming hydroxides, which then react with CO2.36 As XRD analysis shows (Figure 
5B), the mass gain can be attributed to a direct calcite formation, no hydroxide 
residues were found. Changing the temperature from 800°C to 750°C, no significant 
change in mass was observed, which could hint at the presence of surface 
carbonates or hydroxides. At best a mass gain of 25 µg can be observed (Figure S4) 
which is very likely caused by an error in the buoyancy correction. Determining the 
catalyst surface to be 17.3 m²/g, 25 µg correspond to roughly 3% of a monolayer 
covered with carbon dioxide. Extensive surface carbonate formation under 
generation of chains, which are known to be formed on CaO at lower temperatures,37 
is, therefore, unlikely to occur in the temperature range 800°C - 750°C. 
Similar results were obtained by Raman spectroscopy (Figure 6). At temperatures 
above 740°C no Raman active species were found.38 At temperatures below 750°C 
calcite formation can be observed (peaks at 136, 250, 708, 1078 and 1738 cm-1), 
which is reversible upon heating to higher temperatures. The shifted peak positions 
compared to the reported peak positions at room temperature measurements can be 
explained by thermal lattice expansion.39,40 No indication of active oxygen species at

800°C was observed by switching from helium to oxygen containing feed (Figure S5). 
In Raman studies on MgO-supported BaO materials, a peroxide species was found 
to be in equilibrium with a barium carbonate phase covering the magnesium oxide 
surface,41 which is in agreement with the well known formation of stable peroxides for 
BaO and SrO in contrast to CaO and MgO.42

700°C and heating again to 750°C before cooling to room temperature. 
 
3.4 General Discussion 
Finding (i) accordance in the onset temperature of OCM and oxygen activation 
(Figure 7, left) as well as (ii) comparable poisoning of the two reactions by the 
presence of CO2 in the gas phase (Figure 7, right), indicate that similar sites are 
involved in oxygen activation and OCM over CaO. As discussed before, the oxygen 
activation most likely takes place on O- sites, which can be formed on step sites. The 
same sites have been proposed to be active for alkane activation24,43 and CO2 
scrambling.34 The presence of oxygen in the gas phase is necessary for the reaction 
to take place (Figure S6), therefore the O- species alone cannot be active for methyl

radical formation. In case of MgO, methane activation was directly correlated to the 
abundance of monoatomic step sites, where in the presence of oxygen the 
heterolytic splitting of methane forming peroxide species takes place.11,44 The 
absence of a Raman signal in the range of 700-1000 cm-1 also supports the theory of 
only a very minor part of the surface, such as step sites, being involved in the 
reaction, even though the influence of metal impurities in CaO cannot be completely 
neglected having found the sodium content to be below 50 ppm and the main 
impurity to be Sr with 150 ppm, which is known to be capable of forming peroxide 
species.42 Morphologic changes due to the formation and decomposition of 
carbonates during the experiments will affect the abundance of specific surface sites, 
but considering all CaO catalysts being derived from carbonate precursors, the 
nature of the developed surface sites will be the same in all investigated CaO 
samples.

Given the possible presence of such intermediates on the surface of CaO under 
OCM conditions, reaching high selectivity to C2+ products is quite challenging, 
assuming that activated oxygen species and molecular adsorbed oxygen are not 
selective towards C2 formation, but directing the reaction towards oxygen 
insertion.27,45 The complicated situation occurs because the same site appears to be 
responsible for the selective as well as the unselective oxidation of methane. This 
means that the selectivity is dependent on the competitive adsorption of oxygen and 
methane on the active sites. Another challenge is the poisoning effect by side- and 
by-products of the reaction. Carbon dioxide blocks the active sites, which, depending 
on the temperature, can have a significant influence on the yield of the reaction.18–20 
At lower temperatures, CO2 blocks the active sites by carbonate formation, at higher 
temperatures, it adds to the competitive adsorption on the active sites and can, 
therefore, influence activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Here, in agreement with 
findings on MgO,17 no significant influence was found, despite a significant carbonate 
accumulation at lower temperatures (Figure 3, left). This can be attributed to the use 
of an integral reactor. While in the inlet there is no CO2, the initial part of the catalyst 
bed is not affected by carbonate formation, where the downstream part of the catalyst 
is converted to carbonate and inactive in the reaction. With increasing temperature 
more of the catalyst bed is converted to CaO, adding to the overall activity, explaining 
the steady behavior of conversion and product formation. Another negative influence 
of carbon dioxide is the enhanced sintering of CaO, reducing the active surface.46 
Hydroxide formation was not observed under reaction conditions, but a partial OH 
termination of the surface is very likely. As OH can interact with alkanes by H 
exchange,47 their influence has to be considered in a micro kinetic model for the 
oxidative coupling of methane on CaO.

4. CONCLUSIONS 
A simple oxygen scrambling method was applied to qualitatively analyze the oxygen 
activation capability of calcium oxide. An apparent activation energy towards 
scrambling was found to be 80 kJ/mol, which is far less than the dissociation barrier 
of oxygen on pristine CaO surfaces, making defect sites more likely to be the active 
site for this reaction. Calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate were found to be 
inactive (or at least magnitudes less active compared to CaO) towards the oxygen 
scrambling, and, therefore, the oxygen dissociation. Oxygen scrambling of CO2 and 
H2O with O2 was observed on CaO even though the activation energy for O2 
scrambling was found to be significantly higher in the presence of those gases, 
110 kJ/mol in presence of water and 150 kJ/mol in presence of carbon dioxide. Small 
amounts of impurities in the gas feed were found to quench the scrambling activity of 
CaO, explaining why catalytic activity of CaO is only observed above 500°C. 
The onset of OCM reaction and oxygen scrambling were directly correlated 
suggesting that the same active sites are most likely responsible for both reactions. 
The ability to dissociatively activate oxygen appears to be imperative for the OCM to 
take place on CaO. The increased activation energy of O2 scrambling in presence of 
H2O and CO2 indicates, that the rate of desorption of surface species formed by 
interaction of CaO with water and carbon dioxide, such as OH groups and carbonate 
species, is most likely the rate-determining step for this reaction. 
In situ Raman and thermogravimetric experiments confirm the possibility of bulk 
carbonate formation at lower reaction temperatures (depending on CO2 partial 
pressure) and, therefore, CO2 acting as a catalyst poison under certain reaction 
conditions. At higher temperatures a competitive adsorption of CH4, O2, H2O and CO2

has to be considered to explain selectivity and activity of the catalyst. The formation 
of hydroxide species was not found under reaction conditions. 
The results clearly show that neither oxygen nor C-H activation account for the very 
high reaction temperatures generally applied in OCM over alkaline earth oxides, but 
the regeneration of the active sites. Based on our findings targets in catalyst 
development are endorsed that comprise defect engineering to create sites for O2 
and C-H activation and surface modifications to ensure weak interactions of the 
catalyst with the byproduct water and the side product carbon dioxide.
