Abstract
Identifying surface-active sites and reaction pathways is of great significance in heterogeneous catalysis. However, even for the simplest catalytic reaction, there could exist a myriad of possible active sites and reaction intermediates, rending exhaustive computational and experimental investigations of all possible reaction pathways difficult. For the oxychlorination of C3H8 over CeO2 catalyst, electron affinity and Brønsted basicity of a variety of surface sites and reaction intermediates have been calculated using density functional theory (DFT), and a diagram of the corresponding energy levels is used to help identify the relevant reaction sites and intermediates. It is found that surface Cl• radicals that are generated from Cl– oxidation by peroxide at oxygen vacancies play an important role in the C–H activation of alkanes. The formation of C3H7Cl and C3H5Cl intermediates regulates reaction channels and prohibits overoxidation. We show that thermodynamic analysis based on energy levels is useful to elucidate reaction sites and mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation.

1. Introduction
Metal oxide (MO)-catalyzed oxidations of light alkanes have attracted a great deal of attention in heterogeneous catalysis, (1,2) especially for the transformation of light alkanes (methane, ethane, or propane) into value-added chemicals of olefins or oxygenates. To improve the efficiency of the catalytic oxidation, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the reaction mechanisms. However, due to the uncertainty of surface-active sites and the complexity of reaction networks, many oxidation mechanisms remain controversial. In particular, there is considerable diversity of surface sites, such as different defect sites, dynamic adsorbates, and M–O coordination (M–O–M, M–OH, M = O) environments on metal oxides, making it hard to identify the active sites. For instance, there are quite a few proposals in the literature on the active sites for C–H activation on metal oxide surfaces. On reducible oxides like TiO2 or CeO2, Mx+–O2– pairs were proposed as the active site for H abstraction. (3) In contrast, on PdO or IrO2, (4,5) the unsaturated metal ions were suggested as the active sites to form σ-complexes with electron donation and back-donation. For vanadium oxides such as vanadium pyrophosphate and V2O5 having complex coordination environments, the active sites are still under debate. (1,2,6) As yet, investigations of the active sites and reaction networks of catalytic oxidation remain challenging.
Oxychlorination (or oxidative chlorination) is an efficient strategy for alkane conversion with coparticipation of an oxidizing agent of oxygen and a chlorinating agent of hydrogen chloride. (7) The catalytic oxychlorination of light alkanes can produce their chloro-derivatives (CH3Cl for CH4, etc.) or olefins (C2H4 for C2H6, C3H6 for C3H8). The oxychlorination is usually carried out on catalysts of chloride salts or metal oxides. (8) Previous experimental studies showed that pristine or modified CeO2 were excellent catalysts for oxychlorination. (9−11) Particularly, the oxychlorination of methane on CeO2 catalyst can achieve a high selectivity of 66% toward CH3Cl with methane conversion of 12% at 753 K. (9) For ethane oxychlorination, an ethylene selectivity of 69% and an ethane conversion of 94% were obtained at 723 K over an 8 wt % Mn-modified CeO2 catalyst. (10) For propane oxychlorination, a propylene selectivity of 80% was achieved at a propane conversion of 69% over an 8 wt % Ni-modified CeO2 catalyst at 773 K. (11) Co-feed HCl plays an important role in catalytic performances. Taking propane conversion on pure CeO2 catalyst as an example, the propylene selectivity was only 3% and propane conversion was 17% with only O2 fed and no HCl. (11) However, when HCl was pumped in, the propylene selectivity increased to more than 60% and the propane conversion increased to almost 40%. (11) Therefore, HCl participation significantly increases both the reactivity and selectivity and reconciles the common dilemma between conversion and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation. (12) The following questions arise: How does HCl regulate the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes? What are the active sites and reaction channels in the catalytic oxychlorination? What is the chemical state of Cl and how does it change during the course of the reaction?
Recently, Lercher et al. have studied the mechanism of oxychlorination of methane and ethane on La-based catalysts and alkali chloride catalysts. (13−15) They speculated that the OCl– species on the surface might be active for C–H activation, but OCl– was not observed in the experiment. Zhou et al. performed a series of works on methane oxidative bromination (16,17) and suggested that molecular O2 oxidizes HBr into Br• radical and then the gas-phase Br• radical reacts with methane via a radical-induced chain reaction. In contrast, Pérez-Ramírez et al. proposed that in the oxybromination of light alkanes on vanadium phosphate (VPO) catalyst, molecular O2 oxidizes HBr into Br2 and then molecular Br2 activates light alkanes through radicals in the gas phase. (18) However, an earlier study indicated that the gas-phase reaction triggered by halogen radicals can lead to uncontrolled product selectivity. (19) Indeed, it is known that gas-phase radical chain reactions usually give a mixture of polyhalogenated hydrocarbons, which is not consistent with experimental findings for catalyzed oxychlorination. (11) Thus, it was proposed that C–H activation processes in oxychlorination/oxybromination should confine on catalyst surfaces, instead of taking place in the gas phase. The recent kinetic study by Pérez-Ramírez et al. also supported this viewpoint. (20) In addition, Gong et al. studied the mechanisms by theoretical calculations and suggested that HCl hardly affects alkane activation and only provides chlorination channels. (21) Until now, the oxychlorination mechanisms and the role of HCl have not been fully understood yet.
Due to the complexity of catalytic reactions, density functional theory (DFT) calculation can complement existing experimental techniques to study the reaction mechanisms of oxychlorination. We first present the method for the computation of electron and proton affinities, in which an internal reference of proton attached to a surface lattice oxygen is used to balance the change of net charge due to electron/proton insertion or removal. (22) Energy levels, often used to describe defects in solids, (23,24) are adapted to present and compare the thermodynamic driving force for the transfer of electron, proton, and hydrogen in surface catalysis. (25) We thus calculated the energy levels of relevant surface sites to identify the active one and present the energy levels of reaction intermediates to help elucidate the reaction pathways. Following the thermodynamic analysis, based on the energy levels, we further calculated reaction barriers in different pathways to confirm the proposed mechanism.
2. Methods
2.1. Thermochemistry of Electron Transfer and Proton Transfer in Oxidative Dehydrogenation
In oxidative dehydrogenation, C–H bond activation involves a hydrogen (H•≡H+ + e–) transfer process from light alkanes to oxide surfaces, usually with two separate sites accepting the electron and proton. For example, the C–H activation in the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 on CeO2 catalyst is illustrated in Figure 1a. The electron is captured by the oxidative site (e.g., Ce4+), and the proton goes to Brønsted base site (surface lattice O2–). The reactive sites on metal oxide surface could be the intrinsic Mx+–O2– site or different adsorbates. The physical model of electron transfer and proton transfer in oxidative dehydrogenation is shown in Figure 1b. The difference of electron affinity and proton affinity between the H-atom donors and acceptors is the driving force for electron transfer and proton transfer, respectively. Both the oxidative property and Brønsted basicity of the metal oxides surface are parameters to evaluate the reactivity for C–H activation. The electron affinity and Brønsted basicity of surface sites were calculated based on density functional theory. It is worth mentioning that some descriptors, e.g., O vacancy formation energy and H adsorption energy, have been reported to correlate with catalytic activity. (3) For example, H adsorption energy is actually equivalent to the sum of electron affinity and proton affinity here, and the explicit separation of proton and electron transfer has certain advantages of keeping track of the relevant chemical events behind the surface catalytic reactions, such as changes in oxidation or protonation states of surface sites. In addition, the perspective of Lewis acid–base chemistry mentioned by Metiu is also consistent with electron affinity here because the Lewis bases/acids serve as electron donors/acceptors. (26,27)

(b) The physical model of electron transfer and proton transfer in oxidative dehydrogenation. The difference of electron affinity and proton affinity between the H-atom donors and acceptors is the driving force for electron transfer and proton transfer, respectively.
2.2. Calculation Methods and Models
In our calculation, the electron affinity and Brønsted basicity (proton affinity) of surface sites/species were calculated following the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) triangle, (28) as shown in Figure 2a. The calculation starts from a hydrogenated state, taking pure CeO2 as an example; when a H-atom is adsorbed, the proton is anchored on lattice oxygen and the electron is localized on the 4f orbital of Ce, reducing Ce4+ into Ce3+ (see the electronic structure in Figure 2b). Acidity constants are calculated by analyzing the thermodynamics of protonation and deprotonation. (29) In the calculation of deprotonation, one surface lattice oxygen in the model that is far from the studied site was taken as the internal reference (i.e., setting its proton affinity to reference zero). Thus, the energy of proton transfer from the studied site to reference site, i.e., the horizontal line in Figure 2a, corresponds to the proton affinity of that site (ΔEp). The reference site of “H+–O2––Ce” in different cells has a uniform electronic distribution (see the detailed analysis in the Supporting Information), which indeed indicates it can be used as a constant reference. For electron transfer in the vertical line, we couple it with a deprotonation of the reference site to form gas-phase H2, which mimics the standard hydrogen electrode in electrochemistry (30) and gives a redox potential on the scale of a reference electrode based on surface O2– anion site, O2–H+ + e– (vac) → O2– + 1/2H2 (g). The diagonal line in the triangle indicates dehydrogenation reaction, which is the reverse of the hydrogenation of the surface Ce4+–O2– pair, and the energy is ΔEH. Apparently, ΔEp, ΔEe, and ΔEH follow Hess’s law, ΔEH = ΔEp + ΔEe. The surface model and the spin density showing the position of excess electron are shown in Figure 2b. The local states of unpaired electrons are well simulated as our former work. (31) The electron affinity and proton affinity of surface sites are illustrated in a diagram of energy levels in Figure 2c, which closely follows the work of Cheng et al. (25) The red axis of electron affinity points down, and the black axis of Brønsted basicity (proton affinity) points up. The red lines refer to electron affinities, and the larger value, i.e., lower position, means stronger oxidizing ability. The black lines refer to the proton affinities, and the larger value, i.e., higher position, means stronger Brønsted basicity. The gap between the black line and red line corresponds to the hydrogenation energy of the surface site consisting of a pair of electron and proton acceptors. The alignment of energy levels helps us understand the fundamental thermochemistry of PCET reactions on surfaces. (25,32,33) Thus, this energy-level diagram can offer a comprehensive picture of the thermodynamic capability of surface sites for oxidative dehydrogenation.

2.3. Computational Setup
The stoichiometric and reduced CeO2{111} were modeled by a four Ce–O–Ce layer slab with a (2 × 4) surface cell. Full 3D periodic boundary conditions were used with a vacuum gap of 20 Å between the slabs, leading to a supercell of 13.25 × 15.30 × 30.93 Å3. For the surface modeling, the spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). (34) The ion–electron interactions were represented by the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method and the electron exchange–correlation by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. (35,36) The Kohn–Sham valence states were expanded in a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. The (2s, 2p), (5s, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d), (2s, 2p), (1s), and (3s, 3p) shells were treated as valence states for O, Ce, C, H, and Cl atoms, respectively. (37) The DFT + U approach was applied to improve the description of localized states in CeO2, in which U is a Hubbard-like term describing the on-site Coulombic interactions. (38) Herein, a value of U = 4.5 eV was adopted for the 4f orbitals of Ce, which is well tested and widely used in previous studies. (39) Given the large size of cells used, only Gamma point was used for the Brillouin zone integration. For geometry optimization, the ionic positions were allowed to relax until the forces were less than 0.05 eV Å–1. Transition states for C–H activation on the surfaces were determined using a constrained optimization scheme, (40) and vibrational analysis was further carried out to confirm the transition states with only one imaginary frequency. For dehydrogenation in the gas phase, reaction energies were calculated employing the Gaussian 09 computational software package, (41) and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional and 6-31G basis set were used for C and H atoms. (42)
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Electron Affinities and Proton Affinities of Surface Sites
We first calculated all possible electron and proton acceptor sites including the perfect and defective CeO2 surfaces and adsorbates of chlorine and oxygen species on the defective surfaces. The calculated electron affinity and proton affinity levels are plotted in Figure 3a. The structures of the dehydrogenated states of the above sites/species are shown in Figure 3b. The hydrogenated states and the detailed calculations are shown in the Supporting Information. On the clean CeO2{111} surface, the Ce4+–O2– ion pair can accept the electron and proton. The calculated electron affinity of the Ce4+ site is 0.97 eV, and the proton affinity of the connected lattice O2– is close to 0, with respect to the reference surface lattice O2– well separated from the redox center, as shown in Figure 3a,i. The electron affinity of Ce4+ indicates the oxidizing ability of CeO2 that captures one electron on the 4f orbital of Ce. The empty state of 4f orbital on Ce can play an important role in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation. (43) It is known that oxygen vacancies (denoted as “VO”) are easy to form on the CeO2 surface, (44) and energy levels on the defective site were calculated. The stable state for the oxygen vacancy is usually neutral with two neighboring Ce3+ cations, (45,46) but it can donate up to two electrons, giving rise to two positive oxidation states, denoted by Ce4+VoCe3+ and Ce4+VoCe4+. We calculated the electron affinities and proton affinities associated with these two states of the oxygen vacancy site, which are shown in Figure 3a,ii,iii. We found little difference between the two states. The electron affinities for the two states of oxygen vacancy site are about 0.3 eV larger than that without oxygen vacancy, and the proton affinities are similar to that of the perfect surface.

The structures of the corresponding hydrogenated states are given in the Supporting Information. The green balls represent chlorine atoms, and the isosurfaces of the spin density of the unpaired electron with an isovalue of 5 × 10–3 are highlighted in blue. Other notations are the same as in Figure 2.
When HCl is pumped in, it is usually expected that it undergoes heterolytic adsorption and the Cl– anion tends to adsorb in oxygen vacancy, denoted as Ce3+Cl–Ce3+. We consider the corresponding oxidation state, i.e., Ce4+Cl–Ce3+ (see Figure 3b,iv), as a possible electron acceptor. The computed electron affinity of Ce4+Cl–Ce3+ is 1.13 eV (Figure 3a,iv), which is close to the value of the Ce4+ site on a clean CeO2 surface, indicating that the Cl– adsorption has a small effect on the oxidative property. In contrast, the proton affinity of the adjacent surface O2– site increases to 1.09 eV due to the electron enrichment effect of the Cl– ion. In addition, HCl oxidation could occur and we consider the Cl• radical adsorbed on top of the Ce site (Figure 3b,v) as a possible surface intermediate. The calculated electron affinity of Cl• is 1.82 eV, and the proton affinity of lattice O2– near the Cl• radical is 0.44 eV (Figure 3a,v). It is clear that the Cl• radical not only has strong oxidizing ability but also increases the Brønsted basicity of adjacent surface lattice O2–.
The adsorption of molecular O2 may produce different oxygen-containing species that have been previously reported. (47) When the molecular O2 adsorbs in the +1 charged oxygen vacancy (Ce4+VOCe3+, Figure 3b,ii), it can take the electron from Ce3+ and transform to superoxide radical anion O2–. The calculated electron affinity of superoxide O2– is 1.74 eV, and the proton affinity of the obtained peroxide O22– is −0.34 eV (Figure 3a,vi). The adsorption of O2 at the neutral oxygen vacancy can also produce peroxide O22–, which has been detected by Raman spectroscopy in a previous experiment. (11) If peroxide O22– continues to take an electron, the O–O bond will be elongated, forming a hemibond with a negatively charged O•– sitting on the Ce site nearby. The corresponding electron affinity is rather high, computed to be 1.97 eV (Figure 3a,vii). The O•– on the Ce site can accept a proton to form an OH• radical, and the corresponding proton affinity is 0.71 eV. The electron affinity and proton affinity of this OH• have also been calculated to be 1.95 and 0.54 eV, respectively (Figure 3a,viii).
3.2. Mechanistic Implication from the Level Diagram of Surface Sites
According to Figure 3a,i–iv, we found that Ce4+, on both perfect and defective surfaces, has rather weak oxidizing ability. The adsorption of Cl– anion (Figure 3a,iv) does not affect the oxidative property of the adjacent Ce4+. However, surface Cl• radical (Figure 3a,v) has a large electron affinity and increases the proton affinity of adjacent surface lattice O2–. Moreover, O22– (Figure 3a,vii) and OH• radical (Figure 3a,viii) show a larger electron affinity than the Cl• radical.
When HCl is pumped in, HCl can be oxidized to Cl2, which is known as the Deacon reaction, and CeO2 is a well-known catalyst for the Deacon reaction. (48) The formation of molecular Cl2 was observed in the experiment when alkanes were absent. (11) However, the active sites and reaction mechanisms for the Deacon reaction are not well understood in CeO2. The electronic energy levels in Figure 3a help understand them. The electron affinity of Ce4+ (Figure 3a,i) is smaller than that of the Cl• radical (Figure 3a,v), which indicates that the clean CeO2 surface cannot oxidize HCl into Cl• radical. Thus, the lattice Ce4+ site does not participate in HCl oxidation in the Deacon reaction. While peroxide O22– at oxygen vacancies (Figure 3a,vii) has a larger electron affinity, capable of oxidizing Cl– anion into Cl• radical. Therefore, the energy-level diagram can help understand the active role of peroxide at oxygen vacancies for HCl oxidation on CeO2. This also indicates the importance of oxygen vacancies, which is in line with the kinetic experiment that shows the catalytic activity is strongly dependent on the O2 partial pressure and coverage of oxygen vacancies. (49,50)
For the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes on reducible metal oxides (e.g., CeO2), the Mars–Van Krevelen mechanism is well accepted. (3,51) C–H bond activation occurs on the Ce4+–O2– pair (Figure 3b,i), with Ce4+ as an electron acceptor and the lattice O2– as a proton acceptor. On the other hand, HCl feed can effectively regulate the reaction channels of oxidative dehydrogenation, and the role of HCl can be also understood with the help of the energy-level diagram. As shown in Figure 3a, peroxide O22– at oxygen vacancies (Figure 3a,vii) and surface OH• radical (Figure 3a,vii) can oxidize Cl– anion into Cl• radical, consistent with the experimental observation of Cl2 formation in the absence of alkanes. (11) Also according to Figure 3a, it can be seen that the pair of Cl• radical and adjacent lattice O2– (Figure 3a,v) shows stronger thermodynamic potential for C–H activation than the Ce4+–O2–pair (Figure 3a,i). This can also explain the observed increase of propane conversion in the presence of HCl. (11)
3.3. Thermochemistry of Oxidative Dehydrogenation in the Gas Phase
Activation of alkanes on oxide surfaces such as CeO2 can proceed via a rebound mechanism that C–H breaking occurs by direct collision without chemical adsorption. (5) Therefore, the reactivity is not only determined by energy levels of surface sites but also related by the energy levels of gas-phase species. Therefore, the energy levels of the gas-phase species have also been calculated. Without feeding HCl, successive dehydrogenation occurs, and thus C3H8, C3H7•, C3H6, and C3H5• are considered. When HCl is added, chlorohydrocarbons such as C3H7Cl and C3H5Cl may be obtained. (11) The oxidation, deprotonation, and dehydrogenation energies of these gas-phase species have been calculated, and the corresponding levels are plotted in Figure 4.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Electronic and protonic energy levels of gas-phase species. The red lines and black lines refer to oxidation and deprotonation energies, respectively. The gaps between the black lines and red lines refer to dehydrogenation energies (blue arrows). Deprotonation (horizontal), oxidation (vertical), and dehydrogenation (diagonal) energies of the reaction intermediates are shown below, and they are all total energies as calculated for gas-phase species including reference H+ and H2.
The reactivity for the C–H breaking of these gas-phase species can be assessed by the dehydrogenation energy; the more positive the dehydrogenation energy, the more difficult to break the C–H bond. In Figure 4, the dehydrogenation energies of C3H8, C3H7•, C3H6, and C3H5• are 2.1, −0.8, 1.4, and 0.3 eV, respectively. It is clear that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 is the most difficult, while the dehydrogenation of obtained intermediates C3H7•, C3H6, and C3H5• is much easier. Thus, it is expected that the overoxidation pathway that follows “C3H8 → C3H7• → C3H6 → C3H5•···CO → CO2” could be the main reaction channel.
When HCl is involved, the C3H7• radical can couple with surface Cl• radical, forming C3H7Cl. C3H7Cl has a much larger dehydrogenation energy than C3H7• radical. Therefore, further dehydrogenation can be effectively prevented at C3H7Cl. Similarly, compared to C3H5•, the dehydrogenation energy of C3H5Cl is much larger. Thus, the formation of C3H5Cl can also prohibit overoxidation. It is interesting to note that binding to chlorine leads to much more positive oxidation energy, as shown in Figure 4. As a strong electrophilic group, (52) Cl makes the C–H bond in hydrocarbons harder to be oxidized. On the other hand, the C3H7Cl intermediate can effectively convert to C3H6 via dehydrochlorination. (20,53,54) Indeed, previous experiment showed that C3H7Cl could be easily transformed into C3H6 (yield > 96%). (11)
3.4. Energy Profile of Reaction Pathways of the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of C3H8
According to the above thermodynamic analysis based on energy levels, we have further calculated the activation energies of the relevant reaction paths and plotted the reaction energy profiles in Figure 5. The black line refers to the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 on clean CeO2 catalyst in the absence of HCl via “C3H8 → C3H7• → C3H6 → C3H5•···CO → CO2” pathway. On the Ce4+–O2– site (Figure 3b,i), the barrier of the C–H activation of C3H8 is as large as 1.8 eV. Whereas, for the C3H7• radical, the activation energy is only 0.7 eV, which is much smaller than that of C3H8. The generated C3H6 can readily desorb with a negligible adsorption energy. If C3H6 further undertakes C–H breaking, the activation energy is 1.3 eV. Thus, the calculated activation energies indicate that C3H7• and C3H6 are more active than C3H8 and overoxidation is very easy to occur. When HCl is involved in the reaction pathway, the energy barrier of the C–H activation of C3H8 on Cl• radical and adjacent O2– site (Figure 3b,v) is 0.9 eV. Clearly, the Cl• radical and adjacent O2– have kinetic advantage for C–H activation over the Ce4+–O2– site. The generated C3H7• can readily couple with surface Cl• forming C3H7Cl, which can efficiently convert into C3H6 via dehydrochlorination. Energy barriers of C–Cl and C–H cleavage in dehydrochlorination are 0.8 and 0.7 eV, respectively, as shown in the inset of Figure 5. In contrast, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H7Cl is not an energetically favorable pathway, and the activation energy for the C–H bond cleavage of C3H7Cl is as large as 1.9 eV. Thus, the conversion of C3H7Cl clearly prefers the dehydrochlorination pathway over the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. Similarly, after C3H6 formation, the activity of C3H5• would be further quenched by coupling with Cl• because the barrier of the C–H activation of C3H5Cl is as large as 1.6 eV. Therefore, the chlorine group in hydrocarbons makes C–H bond activation more difficult, preventing the overoxidation of alkanes.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Energy profiles of C3H8 conversion in HCl-absent and HCl-present cases. Activation energies (Ea) of C–H cleavage are also given. The black lines refer to the overoxidation channel in HCl-absent condition. The green lines refer to Cl•-catalyzed C3H8 activation and dehydrochlorination of C3H7Cl in oxychlorination. The red lines indicate C–H activation of C3H7Cl or C3H5Cl intermediates. Configurations of intermediates and transition states (TS) are given in the Supporting Information.
Cl• radical-catalyzed C–H activation and dehydrochlorination of chlorohydrocarbons intermediates are the two key features in the mechanism of oxychlorination, as also suggested in a recent experimental study. (20) The oxychlorination reaction is initiated with the activation of molecular O2 on oxygen vacancies on the CeO2 surface. The active peroxide species (O22–) could oxidize Cl– into the Cl• radical, and then the adsorbed Cl• radical effectively reacts with C3H8. The generated C3H7Cl converts into C3H6 via dehydrochlorination, releasing HCl. Thus, HCl recycling in the oxychlorination mechanism follows the “HCl → Cl• → C3H7Cl → HCl” route. It is worth stressing that the catalytic role of HCl is two-fold. First, the addition of HCl changes the reactive site for C–H cleavage from the surface Ce4+–O2– pair to the Cl• radical and adjacent lattice O2–. Second, the formation of C3H7Cl can effectively inhibit the overoxidation of alkanes and is followed by dehydrochlorination to give C3H6.
4. Conclusions
C3H8 oxychlorination on CeO2 has been studied using the electronic and protonic energy levels of relevant surface sites and reaction intermediates. These energy levels present the thermodynamics of electron/proton transfer, determining the reactivity of surface sites and reaction intermediates, which can help identify the active sites and reaction pathways. In this work, the redox ability and Brønsted basicity of surface sites on CeO2 have been extensively calculated using density functional theory. Our calculation and theoretical analysis show that in alkane oxychlorination, addition of HCl leads to the formation of the surface Cl• radical, which together with adjacent lattice O2– is responsible for C–H activation. Thus, chlorohydrocarbons can be readily obtained, which further undergo dehydrochlorination to give alkenes. We expect that thermodynamic analysis based on energy levels could be extended to the mechanistic investigations of other catalytic reactions of X–H (i.e., X = C, N, and O) bond breaking.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. Illustration of the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 on CeO2-based catalysts. (a) The first step of the oxidative dehydrogenation process in which the electron transfers to the oxidative site (ox) and the proton transfers to the Brønsted base site (base) on metal oxides surface. (b) The physical model of electron transfer and proton transfer in oxidative dehydrogenation. The difference of electron affinity and proton affinity between the H-atom donors and acceptors is the driving force for electron transfer and proton transfer, respectively.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Electronic and protonic energy levels in oxidative dehydrogenation. (a) Thermodynamic triangle of electron/proton/hydrogen transfer of a surface site on a clean CeO2 surface. (b) Illustrative model for calculating electron affinity, proton affinity, and hydrogenation energy on the CeO2{111} surface. Yellow, Ce; red, O; white, proton; blue, spin density of an unpaired electron; and pink, the referenced lattice oxygen site. (c) Level diagram for electron affinity (red lines), proton affinity (black lines), and hydrogenation energy (energy gap between red and black lines) of a surface site.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Electronic and protonic energy levels of all possible sites on the CeO2{111} surface in the oxychlorination reaction. (a) Level diagram of different surface sites labeled in the “dehydrogenated state/hydrogenated state” form. (b) Structures of the dehydrogenated states of the respective surface sites. The structures of the corresponding hydrogenated states are given in the Supporting Information. The green balls represent chlorine atoms, and the isosurfaces of the spin density of the unpaired electron with an isovalue of 5 × 10–3 are highlighted in blue. Other notations are the same as in Figure 2.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Electronic and protonic energy levels of gas-phase species. The red lines and black lines refer to oxidation and deprotonation energies, respectively. The gaps between the black lines and red lines refer to dehydrogenation energies (blue arrows). Deprotonation (horizontal), oxidation (vertical), and dehydrogenation (diagonal) energies of the reaction intermediates are shown below, and they are all total energies as calculated for gas-phase species including reference H+ and H2.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Energy profiles of C3H8 conversion in HCl-absent and HCl-present cases. Activation energies (Ea) of C–H cleavage are also given. The black lines refer to the overoxidation channel in HCl-absent condition. The green lines refer to Cl•-catalyzed C3H8 activation and dehydrochlorination of C3H7Cl in oxychlorination. The red lines indicate C–H activation of C3H7Cl or C3H5Cl intermediates. Configurations of intermediates and transition states (TS) are given in the Supporting Information.
