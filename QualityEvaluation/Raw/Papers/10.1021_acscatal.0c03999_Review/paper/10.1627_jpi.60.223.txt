1. Introduction
Propylene is utilized in petrochemical industry as an 
important intermediate for the production of poly-
propylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile1),2).    The 
main routes for the production of propylene are the 
thermal cracking of naphtha and the fluid catalytic 
cracking (FCC)3)～5).    The naphtha steam cracker and 
FCC units, respectively, produce ethylene and gasoline 
as the main products.    The propylene is produced as a 
by-product.    The growth rate of the propylene demand 
is estimated at 4-5 % per year6).    The market demand 
of propylene will not be easily satisfied, because the 
operations of the steam cracker and FCC units are mainly 
optimized for the production of ethylene and gasoline. 
Thus, the risk of a propylene supply shortage is expected 
in the near future.    Recently, a great deal of attention 
has been devoted to the on-purpose technologies for the 
propylene production, such as the dehydrogenation of 
propane, olefin metathesis, and the catalytic cracking of 
C4/C52),7),8).
Among these processes, the dehydrogenation of pro-
pane (Eq. (1)) is attractive in terms of the direct conver-
sion of an economical feedstock to the valuable olefin, 
which could contribute to the chemical industry.

The CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst shows a high activity and 
excellent selectivity to propylene for the dehydrogena-
tion of propane.    However, on the CrOx/Al2O3 cata-
lyst, severe coke deposition during dehydrogenation of 
propane deactivates the performance in short reaction 
periods9)～13).    The steam is normally used for sup-
pressing the coke deposition, but deactivates the activity 
of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst by adsorbing the active site 
of Cr.    Thus, a regeneration process by the coke com-
bustion using diluted air is required after short reaction 
periods14).    Such a cyclic regeneration process for 
removing the deposited coke causes the irreversible de-
activation of the catalyst by a phase transformation and 
sintering.    Hence, the development of a novel catalyst 
with a stable performance is strongly required.
Recently, the iron-based catalyst supported on a sul-
fated alumina was reported to be highly active and 
selective in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane15),16). 
The sulfate addition to the Co based catalyst also pro-
moted the propane dehydrogenation17).    Although the 
sulfation treatment was effective for the catalytic per-
formance, the reason for a promoting effect has not 
been clarified so far.    Therefore, in this study, the effect 
of the sulfation treatment was investigated to improve 
the catalytic performance of transition metal oxide, and 
to clarify the reason for a high dehydrogenation perfor-
mance by characterizing the unsulfated and sulfated 
catalysts using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, X-ray

This study focuses on clarifying the active species over a sulfated transition metal oxide (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, 
Cu) catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.    The unsulfated catalyst showed a high conversion for the dehydroge-
nation of propane, with significantly low selectivity to the desired product of propylene.    On the other hand, the 
sulfated catalyst displayed a high selectivity to propylene, though the conversion was slightly decreased.    The 
sulfation treatment was especially effective for the Co and Fe catalysts.    The sulfate species (SO42–) were reduced 
to the active species of the sulfide ion (S2–) in the reaction atmosphere, which increased a selectivity to propylene.

2. Experimental
2. 1. Catalyst Preparation
The catalyst support of γ-Al2O3 was prepared by a 
sol-gel method (Al[OCH(CH3)2]3: 12 g, HNO3 aq.: 
6 mL, HCHO: 4 mL, H2O: 80 mL).    Then, ammonium 
sulfate was added to the γ-Al2O3 sol.    In case of the 
preparation of the unsulfated catalyst, the addition of 
the ammonium sulfate was skipped.    After a dry and 
calcination processes at 700 ℃ for 2 h, a sulfated 
γ-Al2O3 support was obtained (abbreviated as Al2O3 or 
SO42–/Al2O3).    The transition metal oxide (Cr, Mn, Fe, 
Co, Ni, Cu) was supported by an evaporation to dryness 
as follows; each metal nitrate was impregnated on 
SO42–/Al2O3.    After a calcination of the catalyst at 
700 ℃ for 2 h, the sulfated catalyst was obtained 
(abbreviated as M/Al2O3 or M/SO42–/Al2O3, M: Cr, Mn, 
Fe, Co, Ni, Cu).    The loading of SO42– and metal was 
5 wt% and 20 wt%, respectively.
2. 2. Catalytic Activity Test
The catalytic activity was evaluated using a fixed-bed 
reactor.    The reactant of C3H8 and diluent He were 
supplied to the reactor by 5.0 mL min–1 and 45.0 mL 
min–1, respectively.    Reaction temperature and catalyst 
weight were 600 ℃ and 500 mg.    Outlet gases were 
analyzed using hydrogen-flame ionization detector 
(FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) gas 
chromatographs.
2. 3. Characterization
The crystalline structure of the prepared catalyst was 
ascertained by X-ray powder diffraction with CuKα 
radiation (λ＝1.54 Å, Ultima IV; Rigaku Corp.).    Raman 
spectroscopy was performed using a Renishaw spec-
trometer.    The spectra were collected between 100 cm–1 
and 1000 cm–1 under the sample exposed to air at ambi-
ent temperature.    The quantifications of the S species 
and carbon deposited on the catalysts were accom-
plished using an elemental analyzer of a FlashEA 1112 
(Thermo Electron Corp.).    For analysis of the catalyst 
surface, an XPS (Axis Ultra DLD; Shimadzu Corp.) 
measurement was performed using monochromatic 
AlKα radiation.    The binding energy was referred to 
the carbon of C1 s＝284.7 eV for convenience.    The S 
K-edge XANES measurements were performed by ﬂuo-
rescence X-ray yield method at the soft X-ray absorp-
tion fine structure (XAFS) beamline BL6N1 of the 
Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center (Aichi SR), which 
has an electron storage ring with a circumference of 
72 m and is operated at an electron energy of 1.2 GeV 
with a current of 300 mA.
3. Results and Discussion
3. 1. Catalytic Performance
In order to investigate the effect of sulfation treat-
ment on a catalytic performance, the activity test was 
performed over the M/Al2O3 and M/SO42–/Al2O3 (M: 
Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) catalysts.    Figures  1(a) and 
1(b) showed propane conversion with time on stream. 
The Cr/Al2O3 catalyst displayed a high initial conver-
sion, but showed a gradual deactivation behavior.    The 
Ni/Al2O3 catalyst denoted a similar catalytic behavior 
to the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst.    The Co/Al2O3 and Fe/Al2O3 
catalysts also revealed a high propane conversion, how-
ever the activity tests could not be performed due to a 
considerable coke deposition on these catalysts, leading 
to a blockage of the reactor.    The Mn/Al2O3 and Cu/
Al2O3 catalysts showed a considerably low conversion.

Propane Conversion over (a) M/Al2O3 and (b) M/SO42–/
Al2O3 Catalysts with Time on Stream
In case of the sulfated catalyst (Fig.  1(b)), the M/SO42–/
Al2O3 catalysts (M: Co, Fe, Ni, Cr) showed a lower pro-
pane conversion, compared to the unsulfated bare cata-
lysts.    However, the important finding in the sulfation 
treatment is the improvement of the catalytic stability 
of the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 and Fe/SO42–/Al2O3 catalysts. 
Especially, the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 catalyst has no deactiva-
tion during the dehydrogenation reaction for 200 min. 
Table  1 showed the amount of coke deposited on the 
unsulfated and sulfated catalysts.    The amount of coke 
deposition was significantly decreased by the sulfation 
treatment.    Such a decrease of the coke amount might 
contribute to the improvement of the catalytic stability.
Figures  2(a) and 2(b) showed a product selectivity 
at the end of the reaction period over the M/Al2O3 and 
M/SO42–/Al2O3 (M: Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) catalysts. 
The selectivity to propylene was clearly improved by the 
sulfation treatment.    Namely, the improvement from 
63.1 to 88.7 % was observed over the Fe/Al2O3 catalyst; 
that from 0 to 87.2 % over the Co/Al2O3 catalyst; that 
from 85.6 to 92.2 % over the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst; that 
from 36.5 to 79.9 % over the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. 
In order to compare the selectivity at the almost same 
conversion over the Co/Al2O3 and Co/SO42–/Al2O3 cata-
lysts, we investigated the products selectivity at differ-
ent propane conversion under various W/Fs, which is 
the ratio of a catalyst weight to the ﬂow rate of propane. 
 
Figures  3(a) and 3(b) showed products selectivity at 
various propane conversion over the Co/Al2O3 and Co/
SO42–/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively.    Over the Co/
Al2O3 catalyst, propylene selectivity was 69.7 % at 
3.7 % conversion.    Methane, ethylene and carbon 
monoxide were obtained as by-products.    By-products 
of methane and ethylene probably produced via pro-
pane decomposition on the catalyst as the following Eq.

Slight by-product of carbon monoxide was probably 
produced via the propane and/or propylene oxidation 
using a lattice oxygen in the Co oxide species.    By in-
creasing propane conversion from 3.7 to 16.3 %, the 
propylene selectivity was decreased from 69.7 to 50.4 %. 
The selectivity to methane and carbon monoxide was 
increased.    The propylene sequentially reacted on the 
catalyst via the hydrogenolysis of propylene (Eq. (3)) 
and oxidation of the produced ethylene by lattice oxy-
gen (Eq. (4)) proceeded on the catalyst.

version, the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 catalyst displayed a high 
propylene selectivity: 84.6 % at 18.3 % conversion; 
80.0 % at 26.1 % conversion; and 72.6 % at 29.6 % 
conversion.    Compared to the propylene selectivity at 
the almost same conversion over the unsulfated and sul-
fated catalysts, the dehydrogenation was found to selec-
tively proceed on the sulfated catalyst.    In other words, 
there was an interaction between the sulfate ion and Co 
element, which produced a higher propylene selectivity 
over the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 catalyst than that over the Co/
Al2O3 catalyst.
3. 2. Catalyst Structure
Table  2 indicated the amount of S species on the 
SO42–/Al2O3 before and after calcination process.    The 
amount of S species on the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 catalysts 
before and after reaction was also shown in Table  2. 
The SO42–/Al2O3 before calcination had 1.74 wt%, 
which was corresponded to 5.22 wt% of the sulfated 
ion (SO42–).    By calcining the SO42–/Al2O3 sample, the 
amount of S species was decreased by 43.7 %. 
Further calcination process and the dehydrogenation 
reaction caused a decrease of the S species on the cata-
lyst.    The portion of the sulfated ion (SO42–) was dis-
appeared from the catalyst by the calcination process 
and the reaction.    However, the S species was remained 
on the catalyst, even if the catalyst was exposed to the 
reaction atmosphere.
The structure of the Co/Al2O3 and Co/SO42–/Al2O3 
catalysts was investigated by an XRD measurement, to 
examine the effect of the sulfation treatment on the bulk 
structure.    Figures  4(a) and 4(b) showed the catalyst 
structure before and after the dehydrogenation of the 
Co/Al2O3 and Co/SO42–/Al2O3 catalysts.    Before the 
reaction, the peaks were identified with the γ-Al2O3, 
Co3O4 and CoAl2O4.    As for the catalysts after the de-
hydrogenation, the peaks were fitted with the γ-Al2O3, 
Co3O4 and CoAl2O4 as well as Co metal.    The reduc-
ing atmosphere caused the reduction of Co3O4 to Co 
metal.    Compared to the XRD patterns between the 
unsulfated and sulfated catalyst, there were almost no 
differences in the catalyst structure.    Figure  5 showed 
the Raman spectra of the Co/Al2O3 and Co/SO42–/Al2O3 
catalysts before and after the reaction.    The spectrum 
shows clearly the Raman peaks at 203, 485, 530, 624 
and 692 cm–1 in the range of 100-1000 cm–1, which cor-
respond respectively to the F12 g, Eg, F22 g, F32 g and A1 g 
modes of crystalline Co3O4 or CoAl2O418).    There were 
almost no differences in all catalysts.    These results 
obtained from XRD and Raman measurements indicated 
that the sulfation treatment did not affect the bulk struc-
ture of Co oxide.
3. 3. Catalyst Surface
Figures  6(a) and 6(b) showed XPS spectra of core 
electron for Co2p and S2p of the Co/Al2O3 and Co/SO42–/
Al2O3 catalysts before the dehydrogenation, respectively. 
From Fig.  6(a), the peaks for Co3＋ were observed at 
around 779.4 eV and 795.2 eV19).    In the S2p spectrum, 
the peak for sulfate ion of SO42– was confirmed at 
169.7 eV.    Compared to the peak positions between 
the Co/Al2O3 and Co/SO42–/Al2O3 catalysts before the 
de 
hydrogenation, the peak of cobalt species was slightly

shifted to higher binding energy and broadened by sul-
fation treatment: 779.5 eV and 795.2 eV over the Co/
Al2O3 catalyst; and 780.6 eV and 796.3 eV over the Co/
SO42–/Al2O3 catalyst.    Because the XPS peak for Co2＋ 
species appeared at higher binding energy than that for 
Co3＋ species, the cobalt element in the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 
catalyst had a lower oxidation state20).    This phenome-
non might derive from the interaction between sulfated 
ion (SO42–) and cobalt element to form CoSO4-like spe-
cies.    Figures  7(a) and 7(b) showed XPS spectra of 
core electron for Co2p and S2p of the Co/Al2O3 and Co/
SO42–/Al2O3 catalysts after the dehydrogenation reac-
tion, respectively.    From Fig.  7(a), a slight peak shift 
to higher binding energy was observed over both cata-
lysts, compared to the catalysts before the reaction. 
This result meant that the Co3O4 might be reduced and 
disappeared after reaction due to the reduction by pro-
duced H2 in the propane dehydrogenation21).    The peak 
for Co species over the sulfated catalyst was resulted in 
almost the same position, compared to that over the 
unsulfated catalyst.    From Fig.  7(b), the two peaks were 
observed in the S2p spectra at 169.7 eV and 162.4 eV, 
which were corresponded to sulfated ion (SO42–) and 
sulfide ion (S2–)22).    The reaction atmosphere was re-
ductive, which caused the reduction of sulfated ion 
(SO42–) to sulfide ion (S2–).    As described in catalytic 
performance over the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 in Fig.  1(b), the 
propane conversion was increased with time on stream. 
 
In order to consider the relationship between the cata-
lytic performance and S2– species on the catalyst, XPS 
analyses were performed over the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 cata-
lyst after 20, 50 and 200 min reaction.    To evaluate the 
amount of S2– species on the catalyst, the ratio of the 
area of S2– and SO42– species to the area of Al3＋ was 
calculated and summarized in Table  3.    From 
Table  3, the ratio of SO42–/Al3＋ had no tendency.    The 
ratio of SO42–/Al3＋ on the catalyst after 20 min reaction 
was largely decreased, compared to that on the catalyst 
before the dehydrogenation.    During the reaction, the 
sulfated ion (SO42–) species were reduced and/or 
desorbed from the catalyst.    Such phenomena might 
cause a large decrease of the ratio of SO42–/Al3＋. 
Additionally, the ratio of SO42–/Al3＋ did not become a 
constant value even if the progress of the reaction.    On 
the other hand, the ratio of S2–/Al3＋ has the tendency, 
which was slightly increased with time on stream. 
Since the catalytic activity was increased with time on 
stream (Fig.  1(b)), the activity might be related with 
sulfide ion (S2–), excluding sulfated ion (SO42–) species.

The oxidation state of the reduced sulfur species was 
further analyzed by XANES measurement in detail. 
Figure  8 showed S K-edge XANES spectrum of the 
Co/SO42–/Al2O3 catalyst before and after the dehydro-
genation.    The peak for the S6＋ in standard CoSO4 
closely matched with the observed peak at 2481.8 eV in 
the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 catalyst before the dehydrogena-
tion.    The absorption at 2481.8 eV was attributed to 
the transition of S1 s core level electrons to t2＊ of S3p 
orbital23).    Good agreement between the standard sample 
and the catalyst before the dehydrogenation indicated 
that the sulfur species was present as sulfated ion (SO42–). 
On the other hand, XANES spectrum of the catalyst 
after the dehydrogenation was coincident with the CoS

standard sample including CoSO4.    The peaks at 
2470.8 eV and 2481.8 eV were corresponded to sulfide 
ion (S2–) and sulfated ion (SO42–) species, respectively. 
The first prominent absorption at 2470.8 eV was derived 
from the transition of S1 s core level electrons to un-
occupied S3p σ＊ antibonding hybridized with Co3d (eg) 
orbital24).    From XANES results, the CoS and CoSO4 
were present on the surface of the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 cata-
lyst during the dehydrogenation.
Figure  9 displays a STEM image and an elemental 
mapping of the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 catalyst after reaction. 
From the mapping, the S species was slightly detected. 
In addition, the mapping shapes of the S species almost 
fit with the dispersed state of the Co component.    The 
result indicated that Co_S bond was formed by the reac-
tion atmosphere.    The formed CoS species would have 
an important role on the propane dehydrogenation.

Dehydrogenation Performance
As shown in Fig.  1(b), the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 catalyst 
had an induction period to show a high performance for 
dehydrogenation.    The reason for the induction period 
was considered to be the formation of CoS species on 
the catalyst as shown in the section 3. 3.    In order to 
form S2– species on the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 catalyst before 
the dehydrogenation, the pre-reduction was performed 
using 5 vol%-H2 stream (5 mL min –1) at 600 ℃. 
Figure  10 showed a propylene yield with time on stream 
over the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 catalyst with and without the 
H2 reduction.    The propylene yield over the Co/SO42–/
Al2O3 catalyst without pre-reduction was increased with 
time on stream.    On the other hand, there was no 
induction period over the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 catalyst with 
pre-reduction.    The pre-reduction might produce CoS 
species on the Co/SO42–/Al2O3 catalyst, which dis-
played a good performance.
Based on the obtained results, the CoS species might 
be responsible for the dehydrogenation performance. 
Other researchers also reported the importance for metal 
sulfide for dehydrogenation of alkane.    Wang et al. 
investigated that the metal sulfide catalyst for dehydro-
genation of isobutane to isobutene25).    The metal sulfide 
catalyst showed a higher dehydrogenation performance 
in terms of selectivity, compared to the metal oxide cat-
alyst.    The sulfide catalyst was possible to activate C_
H bond without C_C bond breaking, which suppressed 
the side reaction of cracking of isobutane.    Resasco et 
al. studied the dehydrogenation of isobutane dehydro-
genation over the sulfided Ni catalyst26).    The supported 
metallic nickel catalyzed the hydrogenolysis of iso-
butane, which resulted in extremely poor selectivity 
toward dehydrogenation product of isobutene.    By sul-
fidation of the catalyst, the hydrogenolysis reaction was

suppressed.    The saturation coverage of hydrogen was 
reduced on Ni due to a steric hindrance of sulfur on 
hydrogen adsorption site.    Such an effect suppressed 
hydrogenolysis reaction, and produced a high selectivity 
to isobutene.    Based on these results, the formed CoS 
species in this study might suppress the hydrogenolysis 
reaction of propane and propylene, which produced a 
high selectivity to the dehydrogenation product of pro-
pylene.    Based on the above descriptions and our ob-
tained data, the following reaction mechanism on the 
CoS species was suggested as a possible explanation. 
Propane would dissociatively adsorb on the CoS sur-
face as the propyl intermediate, leaving the H bonded to 
a sulfide ion.    The β-hydrogen in the propyl intermedi-
ate was subsequently withdrawn from the propyl inter-
mediate.    These hydrogen species combined to molec-
ular hydrogen, and followed by desorbing to the gas 
phase.    The produced π-bonded propylene intermedi-
ate would be desorbed from the CoS catalyst without a 
sequential progress of hydrogenolysis.    The above re-
actions smoothly proceeded on the catalyst, which pro-
duced a high selectivity to propylene.
4. Conclusions
The sulfated catalyst showed a better selectivity and 
stability for the propane dehydrogenation, compared to 
the unsulfated catalyst, especially for the Co/SO42–/
Al2O3 catalyst.    The sulfated ion (SO42–) was present 
over the catalyst before the dehydrogenation, and 
reduced to sulfide ion (S2–) during the dehydrogenation 
reaction.    The formed S2– might work as the active site 
for the propane dehydrogenation.

ゾル-ゲル法でγ-Al2O3を調製し，そこへ硫酸アンモニウムを
投入することで硫酸処理した担体を用い，遷移金属（Cr, Mn, 
Fe, Co, Ni, Cu）を担持した触媒を調製した。そして，プロパン
脱水素反応に及ぼす硫酸処理の影響と活性種の調査を行った。
担体に硫酸処理をしない触媒はプロピレン選択性が低かった
が，硫酸処理した触媒は高いプロピレン選択性を示した。特
に，Co 成分を担持した触媒が高選択的にプロピレンを生成し
た。また，安定性も改善されて，触媒劣化が抑制された。硫酸
処理したCo 触媒の反応前と反応後の触媒について物理化学的
特性を評価し，触媒性能が向上した要因を検討した。XRD や
Raman 測定の結果から，硫酸処理は触媒のバルク構造には影
響を与えないことが分かった。XPS やXANES 測定から，反応
前にSO42– として担持された硫黄種は，反応中にS2– に還元さ
れることが分かった。活性の上昇とともにS2– の量が増加して
いることから，S2– が活性種として機能し，選択的に脱水素反
応を促進する一因と推測された。
