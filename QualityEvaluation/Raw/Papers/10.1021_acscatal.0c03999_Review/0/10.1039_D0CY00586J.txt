Catalytic Performance and Stability of Fe-Doped CeO2 in Propane 
Oxidative Dehydrogenation Using Carbon Dioxide as Oxidant 
Hedun Wang a and George Tsilomelekis* a 
Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) in the presence of CO2 was investigated over a series of Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts. 
The well-recognized properties of cerium oxide materials regarding imporved  oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity 
(OSC) was utilized towards the synthesis of stable catalytic systems. The iron-cerium oxide solid solution catalysts with Fe 
dopant content from 1% up to 15% were successfully synthesized via co-precipitation method and calcined at 873K. It was 
confirmed by XRD and Raman characterization that all samples featured single cerianite crystalline phase with periodic 
lattice Ce ions substituted by Fe ions, with no hematite phase identified. Initial screening of catalytic behavior showed that 
propane ODH pathway was enhanced at high Fe/Ce ratio while propane cracking was suppressed. Stable propane conversion 
and propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours was achieved for the synthesized catalysts with moderate Fe loading. Ex-situ 
Raman, XPS and STEM was applied to analyze post-reaction catalyst and confirmed that deactivation occurred over low Fe 
catalysts were resulted from coke deposition on the surface, while CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals 
were the primary deactivation reasons for high Fe loading catalysts.

Introduction
Propylene is undoubtedly among the most important and 
fastest growing in demand petrochemicals. Although fluid 
catalytic cracking (FCC) as well as steam cracking processes are 
still widely utilized, research efforts have been placed in 
developing new technologies that maximize propylene 
production while addressing the big gap between supply and 
demand. Vast availability of low molecular weight alkanes due 
to the recent shale gas revolution is considered as a game-
changing opportunity towards the potential development of 
‘on-purpose’ 
production 
processes. 
Propane 
direct 
dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation 
(ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial 
interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been 
reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3. 
Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high 
temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields.

 The CATOFIN® dehydrogenation process4-5 provides 850000 
MTA (million metric tons annually) of propylene with minimum 
of 99.5% purity and is based on chromium oxide supported on 
activated alumina. The toxicity of the chromium-based 
catalysts, especially the hexavalent chromium species that 
initially dominate the surface of the catalyst, is an important 
issue. The Oleflex dehydrogenation process4-5 relies on the 
traditional Pt/Sn catalytic system to produce polymer grade 
propylene. The high operating temperature as well as the cost 
of the Pt catalysts comprise the main drawbacks. In addition, 
the reaction is usually accompanied by catalyst deactivation due 
to coke formation and spatial separation of Pt-Sn species thus 
highlighting the stability of catalysts used among the major 
botlenecks6-7. 
On the other hand, although the exothermic character of 
propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce 
the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is 
difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of 
propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or 
dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity. Even 
though there is very rich literature on various catalytic systems 
(e.g. metals, transition metal oxides, rare-earth metal oxides, 
metal carbides, supported alkali oxides and supported alkali 
chlorides), the lack of suitable catalysts that exhibit high activity 
while maintaining promising olefin selectivity is hampering 
potential endeavors for large scale commercializing.
The aforementioned competitive reaction network due to the 
overoxidation of parafins and/or olefins can be suppressed by 
replacing oxygen with a weak oxidant, such as carbon dioxide8. 
The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the 
potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) 
reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to 
participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-
gas shift reaction (RWGS).
𝐶𝑂2 + 𝐻2⇌𝐶𝑂+ 𝐻2𝑂        (2)
In recent years, a large variety of metal oxide catalysts have 
been explored in propane ODH with CO2 with dispersed 
chromium oxide species to show great potential as active sites 
towards high conversion and selectivity. XANES and XPS results 
for spent catalysts have shown that during the reaction 
process9-11, Cr6+ undergoes a rapid reduction to Cr3+/Cr2+, which 
is crucial for catalytic activity12-16. With CO2 being a soft oxidant, 
it was found that reduced Cr species can be partially re-oxidized 
to higher oxidative states. Although promising initial propylene 
yield was achieved, Cr-based catalysts suffer from severe and 
rapid deactivation within a short time, regardless of sample 
preparation, reaction conditions and reactor design. The 
proposed

deactivation

reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)/Cr(II) as the main reason behind 
deactivation20.
Pioneering work by the research group of JG Chen has provided 
molecular level understanding on light alkane CO2 assisted ODH 
over non-precious metal (Fe-Ni) and precious metal (Fe-Pt, Ni-
Pt) over CeO221-26. Recently, the effect of oxide supports was 
also investigated by the same research group highlighting the 
CeO2 as the most promising support26 due to its ability to 
activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission. Olefin selectivity was 
found to depend on competitive reaction pathways such as 
ODH, reverse water gas shift as well as alkane dry reforming 
that can be tuned via rational selection of the bimetallic 
composition of active sites. DFT calculations suggested that Fe-
Ni surface favors C-H bond scissoring while Pt-determined 
surface favors C-C cleavage. Additional evidence from EDS and 
TGA of spent Fe-Ni catalyst deactivation showed small regions 
of higher Fe content as compared to fresh catalyst thus 
excluding coking as the main deactivation reason. 
In this work, we report a series of Fe doped CeO2 as catalysts 
that show enhanced stability and promising catalytic 
performance for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation using 
CO2 as soft oxidant. The well-reported oxygen mobility and 
oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria based catalysts sets the 
foundation and main hypothesis of this work towards the 
formation of stable surface active sites27-28. To that end, we 
introduce Fe3+, which is proved to be active for propane 
dehydrogenation23, 29-30 as well as CO2 activation21, 23, 31, into 
ceria lattice with a series of Fe/Ce molar ratios. 
Experimental
Materials and synthesis of catalysts
Ce(NO3)36H2O (99.99%) and Fe(NO3)39H2O (99.95%) were 
purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further 
purification. A series of Fe-doped ceria materials as bimetallic 
oxide catalyst (xFeCeO2T, x indicates the molar percentage of Fe 
over Ce atoms; T indicates the calcination temperature in 
degree Celsius) were prepared batchwise via a co-precipitation 
method, as reported elsewhere32-34. In a typical synthesis, pre-
calculated amount of precursor solutions was mixed and heated 
up to 343K under stirring. NH4OH (Sigma Aldrich 30%) was 
added dropwise as precipitating agent by elevating solution pH 
value. Mixed precursor solution was kept stirring for 1 hour 
when pH adjusted around 7-8. Additional ammonium solution 
was added dropwise until pH reached 10.5. The mixture was 
kept at 343K for 24 hours. The precipitation mixture was then 
filtered, washed thoroughly with 1L DI water and 200ml pure 
ethanol, and then dried at 110C overnight. 
Determination of calcination temperature
Calcination temperature is crucial for phase transformation and 
crystalline growth, as well as removal of surface hydroxyl 
groups and possible carbon-based organics. Fe-doped ceria 
from the same synthesis batch were calcined at different 
temperatures and characterized by BET, Raman and XRD. As 
shown in the Supporting Information, (Figures S1, Table S1) 
calcination at 600°C is beneficial in the following aspects: higher 
specific surface area and formation of Fe-Ce solid solution 
rather than two separated cerianite-hematite phases is 
achieved. Although it has been shown in the open literature 
that 450°C is a suitable temperature in terms of formation of Fe-
Ce solid solution structure35, the actual reaction conditions (as 
shown later) for CO2 assisted propane ODH require higher 
temperature (550-600°C) and as a consequence, all samples 
studied for catalytic tests were calcined at 600°C as an optimal 
temperature.
Characterization methods
All prepared samples were thoroughly characterized prior the 
catalytic performance tests in order to obtain their 
physicochemical properties. 
BET analysis
BET surface area measurements were conducted with 
Micromeritics TriStar 3000 (Serial # 2111) system. Typically, 
around 30mg of catalyst was loaded into a BET tube and 
degassed at 150°C for 8 hours prior to BET analysis in order to 
completely remove chemisorbed water from sample surface. 
Thirteen points were collected within 0.05 to 0.3 P/P0 with 0.02 
increment. 
X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD)
XRD analysis was performed with a PANalytical Philips X’Pert X-
Ray diffractometer to determine crystallinity and phase 
composition. The XRD instrument is equipped with a CuKα 
source at 40 kV and 40 mA and angular incidence 2θ between 
20° and 90° with 0.05° step and 4.0 s/step. The phase 
composition was analysed by whole pattern fitting (WPF) 
refinement 2-phase analysis with relative error R% targeted 
below 15%. Silicon was used as an external standard reference 
to determine any possible peak shift.
Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectra of the samples were collected with a Horiba 
Scientific LabSpec HR Evolution Raman spectrometer cooled 
with a Synapse CCD detector (-70C). The laser line used (532nm 
solid-state, 80mw) was directed on the sample and focused by 
using a 50X long working distance objective. The power of the 
laser was kept at a low value to avoid overheating by using a 
neutral density filter (5%). The acquisition time was 30 seconds 
with a total of twenty accumulations.
X-ray photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis were performed 
with 180° double focusing hemispherical analyzer and Al-Kα X-
ray monochromatic source (400mm analysis spot size). The 
post-reaction catalysts were sieved with 325 mesh. All samples 
were exposed to air in a sufficient long time before analysis.
Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)
Both the imaging and electron energy loss (EEL) data were 
acquired by a Nion UltraSTEMTM 100. The microscope was 
operated at 60 kV with a probe convergence semi-angle of 35 
mrad and an energy loss collection semi-angle of 34 mrad. The 
EEL spectrum image (SI) data was processed using Hyperspy1, a 
python-based microscopy analysis package. After background 
removal, the intensity of each element in the SI data was 
normalized to its maximum value in the SI map such that one 
can visualize the spatial distribution of the elements in the 
acquired area.

Catalytic performance test
The catalytic activity was evaluated in a fixed bed quartz tube 
reactor (4mm ID) packed with 200mg catalyst diluted in 1000 
mg of quartz sand (ACROS Organics 40-100 mesh). Reactants co-
feed consists of propane (Airgas, 50% in nitrogen), CO2 (Airgas, 
BD) and N2 (Airgas, UHP). The reactant mixture was fed into the 
reactor (Scheme 1) with a flowrate varying from 10 to 
30mL/min with 5% propane and 5% carbon dioxide in balancing 
nitrogen, unless otherwise stated.  The catalyst was preheated 
in oxygen (Airgas, UHP) with 5K/min until the desired reaction 
temperature and kept in the same gas environment for 30mins 
to ensure the presence of fully oxidized catalyst. The catalysts 
were evaluated for the ODH reaction in the temperature range 
of 450 to 600C and atmospheric pressure. The outlet stream 
was analysed with an in-line microGC (Agilent 490) equipped 
with MS5A column (for CH4, CO and H2) and PoraPlot Q column 
(for CO2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8). Calculations of reactant 
conversion, selectivity and yield to main product and by-
products were estimated as follow:

Results and discussion
Structural implications of Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts 
X-ray diffractograms of the various Fe-doped ceria materials are 
shown in Figure 1. Upon calcination at 600°C, all the materials 
show that cerianite is the main crystalline phase (reference 
cerianite phase lines are also included). As compared to the 
reference cerianite, all diffraction peaks of the Fe-doped ceria 
samples shift to higher Bragg angles underscoring the formation 
of Fe-Ce solid solution, where Ce4+ cations are partially 
substituted by smaller Fe3+ ions inside cubic ceria structure27. 
The small shift as well as observed broadening of the diffraction 
peaks indicate also possible changes of the crystallite sizes of 
cubic CeO2; however, the average crystallite size of cubic CeO2 
as estimated from the corresponding (111) diffraction peak by 
means of the Debye-Scherrer equation (See Supporting 
Information, Table S1) appears to be within the 8-12nm without 
a monotonic behaviour across different samples. In addition, 
this type of partial substitution of Ce ions has the potential to 
result in different local environments of the oxygen atoms such 
as oxygen from the main ceria lattice phase, oxygen surrounded 
by Ce/Fe cations (Ce-rich) and/or oxygen surrounded by Fe/Ce 
cations (Fe-rich)36. The diverse nature of oxygen atoms and/or 
vacancies created within the surface of CeO2 have been 
highlighted as important active sites for propane activation. It is 
worth mentioning here that crystalline hematite (α-Fe2O3) 
phase was not detected by XRD for any of the samples tested 
indicating a good dispersion of Fe in the ceria lattice. The 
possibility of very small α-Fe2O3 crystals that lie below the 
detection limit of the XRD cannot be excluded. 
Catalytic evaluation
Initial Screening of xFeCeO2 catalysts 
In Figure 2a, we present the catalytic evaluation screening, as 
referred to propane conversion and olefin selectivity for all 
catalysts synthesized. The data reported in Figure 2 pertain to 
initial reaction conditions, 20ml/min total flow (w/F=0.6 g.s/cc) 
and constant temperature at 550°C. The data collected for 
commercial CeO2, Fe2O3 as well as their physical mixture 
(Fe2O3/CeO2 = 1:20 molar ratio) are also included for 
comparison. The commercial CeO2 shows very low conversion, 
less than 5%, with propylene selectivity to reach around 40%. 
Fe2O3 shows slightly higher propane conversion while the 
propylene selectivity decreased dramatically due to the 
formation of carbon oxides as discussed later. A physical

mixture of the commercial CeO2 and Fe2O3 resulted to almost 
double propane conversion (as compared to pure CeO2) with 
the propylene selectivity to reach almost that of pure CeO2. 
Although moderate temperature treatment (close to the 
reaction temperature, i.e. 550°C) of CeO2 and Fe2O3 physical 
mixtures does not alter significantly the local structure of the 
individual oxides, it is reported that the reducibility and overall 
redox properties can be enhanced just through their physical 
contact37. The incorporation of small amount of Fe (1FeCeO2) in 
ceria structure as dopant leads to a significant increase in 
propane conversion while propylene selectivity slightly 
decreases as compared to pure CeO2. Upon increasing of Fe 
content, a monotonic increasing trend in propane conversion 
was observed from 6.5% (1FeCeO2) to 21.5% (15FeCeO2). 
Interestingly, although the conversion increases, the same 
behaviour was observed for the selectivity towards the 
propylene, reaching a maximum of around 47% for the 
10FeCeO2 catalyst. The increase in propane conversion can be 
partially associated with the increase in surface area of the 
catalysts (see Table S1 of the supporting information). A 
maximum in propylene selectivity and propane conversion is 
achieved between 10FeCeO2 and 15FeCeO2 with the initial yield 
to reach ~10% for the 15FeCeO2 catalyst at 550°C. Besides the 
slightly higher surface area, the results suggest that there is a 
promotional effect of Fe as dopant on the activity of C-H bond 
activation. This effect can be associated to relative changes 
induced in active species with different local oxygen 
environments. As Fan et al.36 demonstrated in a recent DFT 
study of ethylbenzene ODH on ZrCeOx, the C-H bond activation 
is positively correlated with charge transferred from adsorbed 
hydrocarbon species to catalyst surface. It is likely that higher 
Fe concentration benefits the formation of Fe-rich oxygen sites 
rather than Ce-rich or Ce lattice oxygen species, which in turn 
results in advantages from two different aspects: lowering of 
reaction activation energy barrier and favoring the formation of 
oxygen vacancies in ceria surface lattice. The former has the 
potential to improve the catalytic activity, i.e. propane 
conversion, while the latter is observed to be closed associated 
with propylene selectivity, which is discussed in later section.
In Figure 2b, the selectivity patterns to methane and ethylene 
are also shown. A monotonic decrease in the formation of 
methane and ethylene is clear as more Fe is incorporated in the 
catalyst 
structure. 
The 
most 
straightforward 
propane 
conversion pathway towards ethylene and methane is the 
catalytic cracking which stoichiometrically results in 1:1 molar 
ratio between these hydrocarbon products:
𝐶3𝐻8→𝐶𝐻4 + 𝐶2𝐻4         (3)
In low Fe content catalysts, the molar ratio of methane-to-
ethylene is very close to 1 (See Figure S2 of Supplementary 
Information), up to 5FeCeO2 indicating that selectivity loss is 
associated to propane cracking. On the other hand, methane-
to-ethylene molar ratio increased by two-fold over 10FeCeO2 
and 15FeCeO2, which suggests that additional reaction 
pathways may exist that lead to the formation of excess 
methane. Among the possible reaction pathways towards 
methane, the propane decomposition to carbon deposits, 
𝐶3𝐻8→𝐶𝐻4 + 2𝐶(𝑠) + 2𝐻2     (4)
is likely to occur at the temperature range of our experiments 
while the CO2 methanation reaction38,
𝐶𝑂2 + 4𝐻2→𝐶𝐻4 + 2𝐻2𝑂     (5)
cannot be excluded. The former reaction is expected to severely 
affect the stability of these catalysts and will be discussed in 
more detail at a later section. However, the total selectivity of 
methane and ethylene decrease significantly at high Fe content 
indicating that these pathways do not dominate the catalytic 
performance under these reaction conditions.
The improved catalytic performance of the 10FeCeO2 and 
15FeCeO2 catalysts is associated with the lower amount of 
other hydrocarbon by-products present under our reaction 
conditions. Considering that the overall carbon balance as 
calculated based on the total carbon flow of all gaseous 
reactants/products is usually above 98-99%, the rest carbon

flow pertains to carbon oxides, CO and CO2. It must be 
highlighted here that the majority of carbon oxides pertains to 
CO that is also consistent with previous reports23, 25, 39. 
Although CO2 formation from deep oxidation is plausible, CO2 
readily reacts over the catalytic surface under our reaction 
conditions as shown also in Figure 2a. It is evident that the 
addition of Fe in the ceria shows a monotonic increase in the 
apparent CO2 conversion that resembles the propane 
conversion behavior. The maximum CO2 conversion (~30%) was 
observed for the 15FeCeO2 catalyst. In carbon dioxide assisted 
alkane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction it is well recognized 
that CO2 participates mainly in the RWGS reaction which in 
turns favours propane conversion as discussed earlier. The 
catalytic behavior presented here for the Fe-doped catalysts 
appears to be consistent with the aforementioned reaction 
scheme, but the difference in product selectivity across 
different catalysts underscores the complexity of the reaction 
network that exists. In addition, recent report38 highlight also 
the possibility of CO2 participation in methanation (reaction 5) 
as well as in propane dry reforming reaction (reaction 6). 
𝐶3𝐻8 + 3𝐶𝑂2→6𝐶𝑂+ 4𝐻2       (6)
Very recently, the concept of CO2 dissociation over reduced 
metal oxides was also introduced in light of reoxidizing surface 
oxygen vacancies according to the following reaction40.
𝐶𝑂2 + [ ∗]𝑣𝑎𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑦→𝐶𝑂+ [𝑂∗]𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑒      (7)
However, it is hard to clearly distinguish the actual selectivity to 
CO and/or CO2 due to the uncertainty of relative contribution of 
CO production from either propane combustion, reverse water 
gas shift reaction, dry reforming, reverse Boudouard reaction or 
CO2 splitting. Future experimental endeavours towards the 
establishment of kinetic and mechanistic understanding can 
shed light on the actual role of CO2 on the activity, stability 
and/or deactivation of the catalyst reported herein. 
Effect of temperature and residence time on catalytic activity
Next, we evaluate the effect of temperature as well as residence 
time on the catalytic performance of the most selective, 
10FeCeO2, catalyst. Specifically, we assess the catalyst activity in 
the 450°C–600°C temperature range while we also varied the 
total flow of reaction mixture within the 10-30ml/min range. 
Figure 3 compares relevant results for the propane conversion 
as well as propylene selectivity and yield. The selectivity to 
other products is also shown in Figure S3 of the Supporting 
Information. Upon increasing temperature and/or reducing 
residence time (W/F), the propane conversion increases 
significantly reaching a maximum of 52% at 600°C and 
0.33gcat.*h/L. The selectivity to propylene is monotonically 
reduced upon increasing the residence time which is associated 
with consecutive paraffin/olefin oxidation to COx as shown also 
in Figure S3. Propylene selectivity reaches a maximum upon 
increasing temperature around 500-550°C while a decrease is 
observed at higher temperature. The decrease in selectivity at 
high temperature is attributed to combustion to COx, thermal 
cracking of propane as well as consecutive oxidation of 
propylene by either catalyst surface oxygen species or carbon 
dioxide41. Thermodynamic analysis of standard Gibbs free 
energy change of light alkanes and olefins cracking shows that 
spontaneity of olefin cracking outweigh alkane cracking, 
especially at high temperatures42. This is also consistent with 
our experimental results presented in supporting information 
that show a monotonic increase in selectivity to ethylene and 
methane, the major products of C3 cracking. It is very important 
here to underscore that the propane cracking and overall 
catalyst deactivation can be also associated with the presence 
of acidic sites on the catalyst surface. In oxygen assisted alkane 
ODH it has been shown that the strength of Lewis acidity of the 
cation sites of the catalyst besides selective C-H activation leads 
also to non-selective activation and combustion. However, 
study on Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts with similar Fe loading has 
shown that even though the incorporation of Fe increases the 
amount of Brønsted and Lewis acids (as compared to the pure 
CeO2 support), their intrinsic strength is relatively low as 
revealed from in-situ IR coupled with NH3-TPD43. Under similar 
reaction conditions, Nijhuis et al. reported the formation of 
coke deposits at different positions of the catalyst bed as 
revealed by in-situ Raman and thermogravimetric studies.  They 
found that significantly less coke was observed at the top 
catalyst layers than the middle and bottom parts of the catalyst 
bed44. Since 550°C show promising propylene selectivity, next 
we evaluate the stability of all catalysts synthesized with time 
on stream.
Effect of C3H8/CO2 in the feed on propane ODH
The effect of the C3H8/CO2 in the feed on the catalytic 
performance of the most selective catalyst identified, i.e. 
10%FeCeO2, was studied under 550°C and total flow of 
20ml/min. Relevant results concerning propane conversion and

propylene selectivity are summarized in Figure 4. Our data show 
that higher partial pressure of CO2 in the feed mixture results in 
slight decrease in conversion for feeds rich in propane and 
almost no change for low propane initial concentration. In all 
cases, a marked decrease in propylene selectivity was observed. 
The highest propylene selectivity exceeded 60% for 5:1 
C3H8/CO2 ratio in the reaction feed while propane conversion 
was maintained at ~18% resulting in a maximum of ~11% 
propylene yield. On equimolar feeds, the propylene selectivity 
remains the same while propane conversion increases in the 
presence of dilute feeds (1:1). These results in conjunction with 
the preceding discussion suggest that the observed negative 
effect of CO2 on propylene selectivity could be attributed to the 
promotion in propane dry reforming pathway. 
Time-on-stream catalytic performance and deactivation 
Figure 5(a-c) displays the propane conversion and selectivity of 
major products on three Fe-doped CeO2 samples with time-on-
stream (stability performance of all the rest catalysts is listed at 
the Supporting Information, Figure S4). The stability of catalysts 
was tested for 20-24hr time-on-stream. We observe that the 
selectivity to propylene appears to be stable for most of the 
catalytic materials tested. With a closer look at the Fe-doped 
catalysts with large Fe/Ce ratio, an increase in propylene 
selectivity is observed within the first 2-4 hours of reaction and 
then remained stable. For the 10FeCeO2 catalyst, this increase 
was almost 10% and was accompanied by a gradual decrease in 
propane conversion from 17.5% to 14%. Similar behaviour was 
observed for the 15FeCeO2 catalyst. Contrary, for low Fe 
concentration catalysts, the propane conversion is more stable 
with time-on-stream; the best stability performance was 
observed for the 5FeCeO2 catalyst. More specifically, the 
conversion for the 1, 2.5 and 5FeCeO2 catalysts was found to be 
stable up to 6, 10 and 15 hours respectively while for the rest 
catalysts a monotonic decrease is observed. 
It is worth mentioning here that for the low Fe concentration 
catalysts, the gradual decrease of propane conversion at very 
long time-on-stream is accompanied by a simultaneous 
increase in the selectivity of ethylene and methane. This result 
suggests that the observed deactivation observed is also 
associated probably with consecutive paraffin and/or olefin 
cracking that can lead to lighter hydrocarbons and/or coke. On 
the other hand, even though a monotonic decrease in propane 
conversion was observed for the catalysts with large Fe/Ce 
ratio, no significant change was noticed in methane and 
ethylene selectivity. These results underscore that between low 
and high Fe/Ce catalysts, different deactivation mechanisms 
may exist that directly affect the stability in their catalytic 
performance. In order to investigate the effect of CO2 on the 
stability of our catalysts, experiments were also conducted in 
the absence of CO2 in the reaction feed for the 10FeCeO2 
catalysts and relevant results shown in Figure S5 of the 
supporting information. By comparing relevant catalytic results 
under identical reaction conditions, we observe an increase of 
the initial propane conversion when no CO2 was present in the 
reaction feed while initial propylene selectivity was almost the 
same. With time-on-stream, there is a very rapid deactivation 
of the 10FeCeO2 catalyst as can be clearly seen from the 
monotonic and rapid drop in propane conversion. The rapid 
deactivation is accompanied by the simultaneous monotonic 
increase in the selectivity of ethylene indicating the presence of 
propane cracking among the primary pathways. It appears that 
the presence of CO2 in the feed helps improving the stability 
performance of the catalysts probably due to the reoxidation of 
surface active sites and/or by in-situ removing coke deposits

from the surface via the reverse Boudouard reaction. We 
believe that the initial improvement of propane conversion can 
be associated with the promotion of propane adsorption on all 
available and accessible active sites. This hypothesis is also in 
agreement with a recent study on FeNi/CeO2 systems25, 45 
where the competitive adsorption between propane and CO2 
was highlighted among the key-factors controlling catalyst 
productivity.
To further investigate the reasons behind the observed 
deactivation, thorough characterization of the fresh and post 
reaction catalysts has been performed via Raman spectroscopy. 
Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the structural 
characterization of metal oxides46-47. Figure 6a shows the 
Raman spectra of the fresh catalysts after calcination. The 
spectral envelope in the 200-800cm-1 range displays a very 
strong band located at 460cm-1 which is associated with the F2g 
vibrational mode of CeO248. Upon increasing of Fe, a very small 
shift was observed to lower wavenumbers that is ascribed to 
the gradual doping of CeO2 lattice with Fe and is consistent with 
the XRD results discussed at an earlier section. A closer look 
shows a monotonic increase in intensity of D band (Figure 6a-
inset) located at 592cm-1 which is associated with the presence 
of substoichiometric CeO2-x units underscoring an increase in 
oxygen vacancies49. The relative intensity ratio of 592cm-1 and 
460cm-1, I592/I460, has been routinely used in the open 
literatures50-52 as an indicator of the presence of oxygen 
vacancies in CeO2 based materials. The I592/I460 is shown in the 
Supporting Information, Figure S6. We observe that the I592/I460 
reaches a maximum at high Fe/Ce catalysts. This trend 
resembles the increase in propylene selectivity thus suggesting 
the possible participation of oxygen deficient site in the 
selective dehydrogenation pathway. On the other hand, post-
reaction Raman characterization shown in Figure 6b, show the 
presence of two broad and intense peaks located at 1344cm-1 
and 1598cm-1 which are associated with the G and D bands of 
carbon deposits7, 53-54. At low Fe/Ce, coke is favoured while at 
high Fe/Ce catalysts coke is minimal. This result suggests that 
the gradual deactivation of low Fe/Ce catalysts is due to the 
formation of carbon deposits on the surface which is also 
consistent with the increased selectivity towards cracking 
products as discussed earlier. However, one cannot exclude 
possible reactivity loss due to rapid reduction of available active 
sites under these reaction conditions. It has been shown that a 
small amount of Fe incorporation in CeO2 lowers the reduction 
temperature of the main surface oxygen sites from ~520°C to 
the range of 370-400°C indicating a weakening of surface Ce-O 
bonds that leads to an enhanced oxygen mobility.  Although H2-
TPR/O2-TPO experimentation has shown to be a valuable tool

towards understanding the redox properties of Fe-doped CeO2 
catalysts43, 55-56, future research endeavors towards an in-depth 
investigation of cyclic H2-TPR and CO2-TPO experiment can 
provide insights into the product distribution and contribution 
of CO2 as an oxidizing agent. Coupling these measurements with 
advanced Operando spectroscopic techniques such as Raman 
and IR can disentangle the contribution of individual active sites 
to the overall performance while providing at the same time 
molecular level information on catalyst deactivation.
In addition, ex-situ XPS was applied to investigate the chemical 
states of highly ordered carbon nanostructures deposited over 
fresh and spent iron-cerium oxides. Symmetrical sp3 peak 
(284.6~284.8eV) and asymmetrical sp2 peak (284.2~284.3eV) 
was fitted to the C1s main feature for post-reaction catalysts57. 
The detailed deconvolution is shown in the supporting 
information (Figure S7). An apparent increase was observed in 
C/O ratio for up to 5FeCeO2 spent catalysts as opposed to fresh 
material, where the C/O basis was estimated within 20~30%. A 
major contribution of this carbon amount lies in the advent of 
sp2 peak fitted on the basis of the invariant sp3 peak, revealing 
aromatic structure as primary chemical states of coke. As higher 
Fe-dopant concentration was reached, C/O ratio decreases 
together with sp2 peak area percentage, observation that is 
consistent with our Raman data. Particularly, C/O ratio fell into 
the range of reference fresh material, which is a strong proof of 
minor carbon deposition after 24-hour ODH reaction.  Although 
the suppressed formation of coke deposits appears to be 
associated with the higher propylene selectivity observed, the 
reasons behind the monotonic decrease in the conversion for 
the high Fe/Ce catalysts is still elusive. 
In an effort to gain more insight into the observed catalytic 
behaviour of the 10FeCeO2, samples before and after reaction 
were investigated using a scanning transmission electron 
microscope (STEM). Typical catalyst particles before and after 
reaction are shown in Figure 7(a-c). It is observed that the 
particle size before the reaction is less than 10 nm (consistent 
with XRD results) while the particle size after the reaction is in 
general larger than 15 nm. This result points to the decrease in 
specific surface area due to sintering as one possible reason 
behind the observed catalyst deactivation as seen from the 
conversion of propane in time-on-stream. In addition, element 
mapping was carried out for the after-reaction sample. As show 
in Figure 7c, iron is found in two localized areas in the mapped 
area. The result suggests that, besides CeO2 sintering, iron also 
migrates to localized areas instead of keeping its initial solid 
solution form during the reaction indicating a significant change 
in morphology of the catalysts which can in turn affect the 
overall catalytic performance. 
Conclusions
CO2-assissted propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was 
tested over a series of Fe-doped cerium oxide catalysts with 
varied Fe/Ce ratio from 1% to 15%. It is demonstrated that both 
propane conversion and propylene selectivity were improved at 
higher Fe/Ce ratio, indicating that propane ODH pathway is 
favored over Fe-rich surfaces. Careful examination on reaction 
by-products revealed propane cracking and dry reforming as 
two major side reactions in the reaction system. At high Fe/Ce 
ratio, cracking reactions appear to be minimized. In general, all 
catalysts exhibit comparably stable catalytic behavior for over 
20 hours continuous catalytic test, with 5FeCeO2 standing out 
as the most stable catalyst.  Raman, XPS and STEM 
characterizations of post-reaction catalysts were performed in 
order to study possible reasons for xFeCeO2 catalyst 
deactivation. Our characterization results unveiled that at low 
Fe/Ce ratio, carbon deposition and coke formation is the 
primary reason that hampers propane conversion while at high 
Fe/Ce ratio, the FeCeO2 catalysts suffer from ceria crystal 
sintering and Fe migration to nano-size crystals.
