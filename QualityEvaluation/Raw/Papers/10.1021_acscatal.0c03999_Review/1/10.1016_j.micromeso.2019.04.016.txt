Abstract 
CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared by adding Cr precursors at 
different preparation stages using sol-gel method (X=1, 2, 3) and incipient-wetness 
impregnation method (X=4), and their catalytic performances of propane oxidative 
dehydrogenation were evaluated in the presence of CO2. The results indicate that for the 
Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method, Cr adding time significantly influences the 
Cr dispersion, surface physic-chemical properties and their catalytic performance. Cr/MSS-2 
catalysts obtained by adding Cr precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) show the 
optimal catalytic activity. Although Cr/MSS-1 also shows good CrOX dispersion, part CrOX 
wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres presents weaker catalytic activity. In this 
work, the catalyst preparation method is quite facile and has the potential to be utilized for 
industrial production.

Introduction 
In the past decades, the dehydrogenation of light paraffin is one of the most remarkable 
study fields, which is the excellent way to obtain high value-added olefins using readily 
available alkanes [1-13]. Propene is an extremely important chemical in petrochemical 
industry and its demand continues to increase in recent years. Research on dehydrogenation 
of propane has developed rapidly in recent years [4-8]. Copiously innovative catalysts had 
been used in propane dehydrogenation process, such as NbOx/CeO2, Sn/SiO2, 
Ga2O3/NaZSM-5, LaZrOx and carbon catalysts [7-11]. However, traditional catalysts like 
Pt-based catalysts[4, 5], V-based catalysts[13, 14] and Cr-based catalysts[15-17] still have 
superiority. Cr-based catalysts attract extensive concern because of their high catalytic activity 
and low price. Additionally, they can be applied for both direct propane dehydrogenation 
(PDH) and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP)[18, 19]. 
Compared with direct PDH process, the ODHP process can overcome the limitation of 
thermodynamic equilibrium because it is an exothermic reaction [20-22]. However, using O2 
and NO2 as oxidants often causes excessive oxidation and environmental problems, which 
hampers the development oxidative dehydrogenation of propane [23-25]. CO2 is a mild 
oxidant in comparison with O2 and NO2 and can hinder the deep oxidation of alkenes [20, 
26-29]. Additionally, the consumption of CO2 is an environmentally friendly route, which is 
in line with the meaning of green chemistry. Botavina et al[30] compared the propane 
dehydrogenation performance of 2.0-Cr/DHS catalyst under N2, O2, CO2 atmosphere, 
respectively. They found the highest propane yield was achieved under CO2 atmosphere. 
Therefore, CO2 is an ideal oxidant for ODHP process. 
Mesoporous silica is a promising support in catalytic dehydrogenation because it has high 
surface area, good thermal stability, low acidity, uniform structure and adjustable mesoporous 
size [31-34]. In particular, when CO2 was chosen as the oxidant, compared with Al2O3 and 
active carbon, mesoporous silica can motivate the performance of Cr-based catalysts for ODHP 
process [26, 35]. In many cases, wet impregnation and direct synthesis were the most widely 
used technique for preparing supported catalysts with mesoporous silica carrier. Recently, 
direct synthesis was brought into focus because the prepared catalysts had high dispersion of

metal oxides and superior catalytic activity [36-38]. Hu et al[39] studied the effects of 
gelation temperature of VOx-SiO2 catalysts obtained by in-situ one pot synthesis. Zapata et 
al[33] prepared Cr/SiO2 mesoporous catalysts by hydrothermal method and studied the effect 
of hydrothermal treatment and calcination temperature on the structure and properties of the 
catalysts. It seems that researchers paid more attention to the temperature condition in direct 
synthesis. However, we developed a great interest in the preparation of catalysts in one-pot 
synthesis. Hu introduced active precursor NH4VO3 in the initial solution, but Zapata added 
Cr(NO3)3·9H2O together with tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) during the reaction. This 
difference was also observed in other studies. Baek synthesized Cr/MSU-x catalysts 
employing sol-gel method by adding Cr(NO3)3·9H2O in the initial solution [34]. On the 
contrary, also using sol-gel method, Wang introduced tin chloride at the second stage of 
reaction and obtained Sn-HMS catalysts[8]. In previous studies, catalysts were prepared by 
adding active precursors at different preparation stages in the one-pot direct synthesis. However, 
the effect of the adding time of active precursors on the morphology, pore structure, active 
species and catalytic performance of catalysts was scarcely paid attention. 
In this work, CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared with 
sol-gel method for ODHP in the presence of CO2. The effect of the Cr precursors of the adding 
time on the structure and catalytic performances of Cr/MSS-X catalysts is studied in detail. The 
state-of-the-art characterization techniques were applied to explore the physicochemical 
properties and structure-performance relationship of Cr/MSS-X catalysts. The catalytic 
performances of the prepared Cr/MSS-X catalysts were evaluated by ODHP in the presence 
of CO2.

2.1. Catalyst preparation 
Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) (≥99%,aladdin), triethanolamine (TEAH3) 
(AR, ≥98%, aladdin), tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) (GC, ≥99%, aladdin), and

illustrated in Scheme 1. 
A mixture of 0.306 g of CTAB, 21.34 g of TEAH3, 50 mL of deionized water and 0.67 g 
of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O were stirred at 80°C for 1 h. Then, 3.098 g of TEOS was added into the 
mixture quickly and was kept stirring at 80°C for 3 h. The resultant mixture was filtered and 
washed with deionized water and ethanol for three times, respectively. After that, the obtained 
precipitate was dried at 100°C in an oven for 20 h. Finally, the solids were calcined in air at 
600°C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2°C/min to remove the template. The finally obtained 
catalyst was named as Cr/MSS-1. 
The synthesis of Cr/MSS-2 was performed with the similar step to Cr/MSS-1 except for 
the Cr(NO3)3·9H2O adding time. The mixture of 0.306 g of CTAB, 21.34 g of TEAH3 and 50 
mL of deionized water were stirred at 80°C for 1 h. Then, 3.098 g of TEOS and 0.67 g of 
Cr(NO3)3·9H2O were quickly added into the mixture in sequence and was kept stirring at 
80°C for 3 h. Subsequent filtration, drying and calcination treatment were the same as 
Cr/MSS-1. 
For preparing Cr/MSS-3, a mixture of 0.306 g of CTAB, 21.34 g of TEAH3 and 50 mL of 
deionized water was stirred at 80 °C for 1 h. Then 3.098 g of TEOS was added into the 
mixture quickly and kept stirring at 80°C for 2 h. After that, 0.67 g of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O was 
added to the mixture and continued stirring for 1 h. Subsequent filtration, drying and 
calcination were the same as Cr/MSS-1. 
Cr/MSS-4 was synthesized by incipient-wetness impregnation with MSS as support. The 
resultant mixture was aged for 12 h, then filtered, washed, dried and calcined, which was 
consistent with the previous process. 
Pure MSS and Cr/MSS-1 were prepared in the same way, except that no Cr(NO3)3·9H2O 
was added. 
2.2. Catalysts characterization 
The textural properties of samples were obtained N2 adsorption–desorption at 77K with 
an automatic analyzer (NOVA 4000, Quantachrome, USA). Before the measurement, the 
Cr/MSS-X samples were degassed at 573k for 3 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were 
collected on a Bragg–Brentano diffractometer (RigakuD/Max-2000). The diffraction patterns 
were perceived with a monochromatic Cu Ka radiation (k = 1.5418 Å). The catalysts were

scanned from the 2θ value of 20 to 60° with a scanning rate of 5°/min. The morphologies of 
catalysts were recorded by HITACHI S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscopy 
(FESEM) at 5.0KV. TEM images were observed with a JEM-2010 microscope operated at 
200 kV. Jobin Yvon confocal laser Raman spectrometer (SuperLabRam II) was used to record 
Raman spectra with a 632.8nm He–Ne ion laser beam. All spectra were obtained by three 
accumulations within 30 s. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) results were collected on 
the Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using an Al Ka source. 
The binding energy (BE) was detected with the C1s level at 284.9 eV as a reference. The 
weighed catalysts were dissolved with HF/HNO3(3:1 V/V) solution and the chromium 
contents of the catalysts were obtained with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission 
spectroscopy (ICP-AES) with Varian Vista MPX. Ultraviolet–visible (UV−vis) spectra of the 
catalysts were collected on a Shimadzu MPC-3100 spectrophotometer. BaSO4 was used as the 
reference and the range was 200−800 nm. Temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen 
(H2-TPR) analysis was tested on an autosorb-iQ Instrument equipped with a programmable 
temperature system (Quantachrome, USA). The samples were placed in a U-tube reactor and 
pretreated with a dry argon flow at 500°C for 1 h. Then, the reactor was heated from room 
temperature to 800°C with the rate of 10°C/min under a mixture gas of 10% H2 and 90% (v/v) 
Ar. Temperature programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) measurements were 
implemented to analyze the acidity of catalysts on a TP-5080 adsorption instrument. 0.1 g of 
sample was pretreated at 400°C for 1 h and saturated with the NH3 for 30 min after cooling to 
120°C. Finally, the samples were flowed with dry He to remove the adsorbed NH3. 
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the deteriorated catalysts was performed on a 
Shimadzu DTG-60H thermogravimetric analyzer. 3-5 mg of spent catalysts was installed in a 
ceramic crucible and heated from 50 to 800°C under a dry air atmosphere.  
2.3. Catalytic test 
The catalytic test was carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor. 0.2 g of fresh Cr/MSS-X 
catalyst was placed on the center of tube and the reaction temperature was detected with a 
thermocouple. The catalyst was heated from room temperature to 600°C for 1 h with an Ar 
flow. After purging with Ar for 30 min, the mixture gas consisting of C3H8, CO2 and Ar 
(C3H8/CO2/Ar molar ratio = 2/8/8, total flow=18 mL min-1) was fed to the reactor. Products

FID detector. Other products (CO, CO2) were analyzed using another gas chromatograph 
(SP-6890) equipped an online TCD. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were

Results and discussion 
3.1. Structural properties of Cr/MSS-X 
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the MSS and Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by 
sol-gel method with different Cr adding times and incipient-wetness impregnation method. 
Corresponding small-angle XRD patterns of MSS and Cr/MSS-X catalysts are shown in 
Figure S1. All the Cr/MSS-X catalysts only show the peaks at 2θ of 24.4, 33.6, 36.2, 41.5, 
50.2, 54.9, 63.3 and 65.1, which are ascribed to the typical characteristic reflections of 
α-Cr2O3. It should be pointed out that α-Cr2O3 is the most stable CrOx species and has a 
negative impact on the catalytic activity of ODHP reaction[40]. In Figure 1, Cr/MSS-1 
catalyst shows the weakest diffraction peaks; while Cr/MSS-4 prepared by incipient-wetness

impregnation method exhibits the strongest ones. It should be noteworthy that the CrOx 
species on the support are affected by the dispersion of Cr. Previous research has 
demonstrated that the polymerization of CrOx species would lead to the formation of α-Cr2O3 
species [40-42]. XRD results show that α-Cr2O3 contents of Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2 are 
lower than those of Cr/MSS-3 and Cr/MSS-4. It should be attributed to different Cr adding 
times in the catalyst preparation process. During the preparation of Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2, 
Cr precursor was introduced together with silicon oligomers. Thus, CrOx species were well 
distributed along the whole micelle-silica wall. In contrast, the silicon spheres partially 
formed when Cr precursor was added for Cr/MSS-3. So the Cr precursor was distributed only 
on the later formed micelle-silica wall. As for Cr/MSS-4, it was prepared by incipient-wetness 
impregnation. A mass of Cr precursor was huddled in the channels and easily formed α-Cr2O3 
species, which caused poor Cr dispersion. 
The low-temperature nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements of MSS and 
Cr/MSS-X were determined and the results are shown in Figure 2. The BJH model pore size 
distribution is shown in Figure S2. It is noted that the isotherm curves of MSS, Cr/MSS-3 and 
Cr/MSS-4 have a rise trend at the high relative pressure p/p0=0.9-0.99, which is caused by the 
accumulation of the uniform particles of MMS, Cr/MSS-3 and Cr/MSS-4 [43-45]. On the 
contrary, Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2 particles are more homogeneous without the rise trend in 
their isotherm curves. This also can be evidenced by the subsequent FESEM images of the 
catalysts. The textural properties of MSS and Cr/MSS-X samples are summarized in Table 1. 
There are little difference in specific surface area (SBET) and pore diameter (Dp) among MSS, 
Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2 samples. This means that Cr precursors didn’t change the pore 
structure in Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2. However, the SBET of Cr/MSS-3 is significantly 
reduced to 706.85 m2/g. It can be attributed to α-Cr2O3 clusters that block part pore 
channels[37]. Compared with others, Cr/MSS-4 prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation 
has an observable decline in SBET, VTotal and Dp. For Cr/MSS-4, Cr species have low 
dispersion and block the channels of support[37]. On the other side, Cr precursors in 
Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2 are embedded in the mesopore walls with the growing of silicon 
sphere. The formed α-Cr2O3 clusters are too less to fill the pores so that the SBET and Dp 
change little.

Figure 3 shows the FESEM and TEM images of pure MSS and Cr/MSS-X catalysts. All 
the samples display in regular sphere form. An interesting phenomenon is found that the 
particle size of MSS, Cr/MSS-3 and Cr/MSS-4 is approximately 60-100 nm; while the 
particle sizes of Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2 are nearly 160-230 nm and 130-200 nm, 
respectively. As can be seen, the addition of Cr precursors enlarges the particle size of 
Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2; while Cr/MSS-3 and Cr/MSS-4 are unaffected. Previous studies 
found that ionic strength played an important role in determining the final particle size[46]. In 
the initial period of the formation of silica particles, higher ionic strength would result in a 
larger final particle size. However, after the initial period, the ion strength does not affect 
particle size of silica particles. The addition of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O increases the initial ion 
strength of the sols for Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2, and thus leads to larger particle size of them. 
However, during the preparation of Cr/MSS-3, Cr(NO3)3·9H2O was not added in the initial 
period, which cannot affect the final particle size. From the TEM results, all the samples show 
wormhole-like mesoporous structure, indicating that Cr adding time does not affect the 
mesoporous structure of the catalysts. 
Raman spectra of Cr/MSS-X catalysts were detected and shown in Figure S3. All the 
catalysts show peaks at 430 cm-1 and 497 cm-1, which are ascribed to be amorphous SiO2 and 
cyclic tetrasiloxane rings, respectively[47, 48]. A broad band centered at around 900 cm-1 can 
be ascribed to Cr6+ species of polymeric chromates [28, 42]. Cr/MSS-4 exhibits the strongest 
intensity of this band among all of the catalysts. It can be seen that the spectra of all the 
catalysts exhibit a band at 980 cm-1, which is assigned to the isolated Cr6+ species[34]. It is 
clear that Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2 exhibit approximate peak intensity which are higher than 
Cr/MSS-3 and Cr/MSS-4. This is in conformity with the XRD results. 
Figure 4 presents the UV-vis spectra of Cr/MSS-X catalysts. All the catalysts were 
detected at the wavelength of 200-800 nm and all of the bands are associated with O→Cr 
charge-transfer (CT). The bands at 270 nm and 350 nm are assigned to the isolated Cr6+ with 
tetrahedral coordination[41]. The intensity of these two bands of Cr/MSS-X catalysts 
decreases in the order of Cr/MSS-1≈Cr/MSS-2 > Cr/MSS-4 > Cr/MSS-3. Cr/MSS-3 and 
Cr/MSS-4 present a shoulder band at about 460 nm and the latter shows a higher intensity of 
this band. This is closely related to the Cr6+ species of dimers or polymeric Cr oxides [34, 49].

The above observations are consistent with the Raman results. Another broad band is 
observed at 600 nm which is caused by α-Cr2O3 clusters [50-52]. Cr/MSS-4 shows the largest 
band, followed by Cr/MSS-3, and Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2 exhibit the weakest band. This 
tendency is in accordance with the XRD and Raman results. 
To further examine the chemical state of Cr in the surface CrOx species, XPS spectra of 
the catalysts were conducted, and the results are listed in Table 2. The Cr2p3 spectra can be 
deconvoluted into two peaks at about 577.0 and 579.7 eV, which are assigned to Cr3+ and Cr6+ 
respectively [53]. Cr/MSS-2 shows the highest Cr6+ percentage and Cr/MSS-4 prepared by 
impregnation method exhibits the highest Cr3+ percentage. It is worthwhile to mention that the 
highly dispersed Cr6+ species play a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation reaction [54-56].  
H2-TPR was carried out to investigate the reducibility of CrOx species, and the 
corresponding curves of Cr/MSS-X catalysts are shown in Figure 5. A broad reduction peak 
centered at 420-440 °C can be seen for all the catalysts, and this can be ascribed to the 
reduction of isolated Cr6+ to Cr3+ species[16, 34, 55]. Among all the samples, Cr/MSS-2 
shows the highest peak intensity and Cr/MSS-4 shows the lowest intensity, corresponding to 
the highest and the lowest isolated Cr6+ contents respectively. This is in line with the XPS 
results. The TPR data show that the Cr6+ peak intensity of Cr/MSS-2 is much higher than that 
of Cr/MSS-1, which is different from UV-vis and Raman results. It can be explained by the 
difference in sensitivity to Cr6+ species in different tests. Another weak band centered at 
287 °C has drawn intense attention in the inserted figures which are partially enlarged view. 
In fact, this band is considered as the reduction of Cr6+ species dispersed on α-Cr2O3[40]. This 
band appears in Cr/MSS-3 and becomes distinct in Cr/MSS-4. This further proves that 
Cr/MSS-4 has the lowest CrOx dispersion, followed by Cr/MSS-3. Although this band can 
hardly be seen in Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2, this does not mean that the catalysts do not 
contain α-Cr2O3.  
Proper acidity is advantageous to dehydrogenation reaction because acidic sites can 
abstract hydrogen atoms from propane, especially in the initiating propane oxidative 
dehydrogenation[57]. Normally, solid acidic sites of catalysts can be classified as weak, 
medium and strong ones. Research has proved that weak acidic sites had no catalytic effect, and 
medium acidic sites could promote catalytic activity [58]. The surface acidic properties of

Cr/MSS-X catalysts were investigated by NH3-TPD measurement and the results are shown in 
Figure S4. The semi-quantitative data were obtained by fitting profiles with Gaussian 
deconvolution method and listed in Table 3. The acidity of pure MSS is too weak (not shown 
in the figure). However, the acidity significant increases after adding CrOx species. Two 
desorption peaks, centered at 230-243°C and 372-295°C, assigned to medium acid sites and 
strong acid sites, are observed for all the Cr/MSS-X catalysts. Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2 show 
the similar fractions of medium acid sites and the total acid sites. Cr/MSS-3 and Cr/MSS-4 
possess larger strong acid fraction and lower total acid sites. It is believed that isolated and 
polymeric chromates can enhance the medium acid sites, but the formation of crystalline 
α-Cr2O3 would weaken the total acid sites [57-60]. The Cr species of Cr/MSS-1 and 
Cr/MSS-2 were incorporated during the formation of pore walls, and thus the good dispersion 
leads to large amount of isolated and polymeric chromates, which can strengthen medium 
acid sites. In contrast, large Cr precursors were aggregated in Cr/MSS-3 and Cr/MSS-4 and 
produced lots of crystalline α-Cr2O3, so their medium acid sites and total acid sites declined 
significantly. Although acid sites are indispensable, they aren’t the only decisive factor in 
catalytic activity. 
3.2. Catalytic performances of Cr/MSS-X catalysts 
The catalytic performances of Cr/MSS-X catalysts and pure support MSS for ODHP 
reaction in the presence of CO2 were investigated in a fixed-bed reactor at 600°C. Blank 
experiment without catalyst was also conducted as a control test. Figure 6 shows the propane 
conversion and propene selectivity vs. reaction time of Cr/MSS-X catalysts and pure support 
MSS. The reproducibility of catalytic performance is shown in Figure S5. All the Cr/MSS-X 
catalysts exhibit much higher propane conversion and propene selectivity than that of pure 
support MSS and blank tube without catalyst, which verifies that Cr species act as the active 
sites. Propane conversion decreases for all the Cr/MSS-X catalysts with the time on steam. 
This decline of catalytic activity might be mainly attributed to the formation of coke, which 
could cover the active sites and block the pore channels of catalysts. Among these catalysts, 
Cr/MSS-2 catalyst presents the highest initial propane conversion of about 70% and the final 
value approaches to 32%. It can be observed that the initial propane conversion of Cr/MSS-1 
is 55% and the final propane conversion is nearly 29%. A rapid decline of propane conversion

is observed at the initial time for Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2 catalysts. It can be attributed to the 
reduction of Cr6+ species. Previous studies proved that the intermedium, unsaturated Cr3+ 
species, derived from the reduction of Cr6+ had higher catalytic activity than the intrinsic Cr3+ 
species in the catalysts[54-56]. CO2 is a mild oxidant, only part of the reduced Cr3+ species 
can be re-oxidized to Cr6+. This can be confirmed by CO2 conversion, a rapid decrease can be 
seen in Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2 catalysts at the initial time (Figure S6). Besides, coke 
formation is another reason for the initial rapid decline. As shown in Figure 6(b), the propene 
selectivity of Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2 rises at the beginning of reaction. This can be put 
down to the high initial conversion. It is well-known that the coke is more easily generated 
from propene compared with propane. In the initial stage of reaction, superior conversions of 
Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2 easily produce a large amount of propene and coke. The coke 
decreases with the drop of conversion accompanied with the rise of propene selectivity.  
TG analysis was carried out to investigate the coke deposition of the deteriorated 
Cr/MSS-X catalysts, and the profiles are depicted in Figure S7. All the catalysts exhibit a 
weight loss of less than 5wt.%. A slight weight loss in the range of 100-300°C is attributed to 
the loss of adsorbed water. The weight loss at 300-450°C is attributed to the burning of coke 
[39]. As can be seen in Figure S7, Cr/MSS-4 shows the minimum weight loss of coke 
deposition (~2.44%). It can be interpreted by the worst activity of Cr/MSS-4. It is worthwhile 
to note that Cr/MSS-2 has higher activity but less coke deposition (4.02%) than Cr/MSS-1 
(4.19%) and Cr/MSS-3 (4.25%). This can be accounted for the difference of the acid sites. 
Actually, strong acid sites easily facilitate the formation of coke[61]. Therefore, the low 
fraction of strong acid sites for Cr/MSS-2 leads to a less coke amount.  
Figure 7 exhibits the reaction-regeneration cycles of Cr/MSS-2 catalyst. The deteriorated 
catalyst was regenerated in an air flow at 600 °C for 4 h to reoxidize the active CrOx species 
and remove the coke on catalyst surface. In the first cycle, propane conversion quickly is 
reduced from ~69% to ~33%. After regeneration treatment, the catalyst is restored and the 
initial propane conversion achieves 60% in the 2nd cycle. In the subsequent cycles, the initial 
propane conversion slightly reduces and approximately attains the stabile point of 52%. 
Figure S8 shows the Laser-Raman spectra of fresh, regenerated and spent Cr/MSS-2 catalyst. 
Both bands for amorphous coke (~1300 cm-1) and graphite coke (~1570cm-1) can be observed

on spent Cr/MSS-2 catalyst[62, 63]. After regenerating, no peak was observed, indicating that 
the coke was removed completely. Previous studies manifested that Cr6+ species would be 
reduced to Cr3+ species during the OPDH reaction, and part of the reduced Cr3+ species would 
transform into α-Cr2O3 species. This α-Cr2O3 cannot be reoxidized to Cr6+ species and leads to 
the decrease of initial propane conversion in the first two cycles[17, 41, 64]. This can be 
verified by the spectra of fresh Cr/MSS-2 catalyst and regenerated sample in Figure S9. It can 
be seen that the bands at 270 and 350 nm of regenerated sample decrease after 5 cycles, 
implying the decrease of isolated Cr6+ species with tetrahedral coordination. Additionally, the 
enhanced band at 600 nm-1 further indicates the increase of α-Cr2O3 clusters of the 
regenerated sample, which is negative for ODHP reaction.  
The chromium content, propene yield, CO2 conversion and TOF values of MSS and 
Cr/MSS-X catalysts are listed in Table 4. All catalysts have similar chromium content and the 
results are similar to the designed chromium content. Besides, it can be seen that the yields of 
Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2 are higher than those of Cr/MSS-3 and CrMSS-4. The difference in 
catalytic performance is mainly caused by the CrOx species on the catalysts, which are 
determined by their preparing process. All of the four catalysts have high CO2 conversion in 
the initial period and low value at the final point. This is caused by the consumption of Cr6+. 
With the increasing of reaction time, lots of Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+ and oxidative 
dehydrogenation of propane becomes weak. Hence, the CO2 conversion is also decreased. 
The TOF values of the catalysts vary greatly. Especially, the TOF value of Cr/MSS-1 is 
almost twice as those of Cr/MSS-3 and Cr/MSS-4 catalysts. The top TOF value of Cr/MSS-1 
should attributed to the lowest surface Cr/Si among all the catalysts (Table 4). The above 
results indicate that, in preparation of Cr/MSS-X catalysts, the time of adding chromium 
precursors plays a key role in determining the catalytic performances.  
3.3. Correlation between Cr adding time and catalytic performance 
To expediently elucidate the effect of the adding time of Cr precursor, the synthesis 
process of Cr/MSS-1 and Cr/MSS-2 catalysts is illustrated in Figures 8-9. 
As shown in Figure 8A, when Cr(NO3)3·9H2O was added with CTAB and TEAH3, Cr 
species dispersed in solution together with micelles. After adding TEOS, the hydrolytic silica 
oligomers would rapidly accumulate and nucleate in the initial stage, and the small particles

formed (the blue cycle in Figure 8B) [46, 65-67]. Thus, large amount of CrOx species would 
be surrounded by silica and stored in the center, which is confirmed by Cr/Si ratios 
determined by XPS in Table 4. These CrOx species aren’t easily exposed to propane and 
present a weakly catalytic activity. As the result, Cr/MSS-1 shows the lowest surface Cr/Si 
among all the catalysts in this work. After the initial stage, the small particles gradually grew, 
and the residual Cr species were dispersed in the mesoporous walls after removing the 
surfactant (shown in Figure 8C)[46, 65-67]. 
Differently, Cr/MSS-2 was prepared by adding Cr(NO3)3·9H2O together with TEOS. As 
shown in Figure 9A, the micelles had been formed in the initial solution before adding Cr 
precursor. After 1 h reaction, TEOS and Cr(NO3)3·9H2O were added into the initial solution in 
sequence (Figure 9B). As soon as TEOS is added, small particles were formed in the initial 
time [46, 65-67]. Therefore, no Cr could get into the center of silica spheres. After the initial 
time, Cr species were dispersed on the micelle-silicon walls with the gradual generation of 
silicon walls (Figure 9C). Hence, after removing the surfactant, Cr species were distributed in 
the whole pore channels. The formed Cr/MSS-2 had higher surface Cr concentration than 
Cr/MSS-1 and better Cr dispersion than Cr/MSS-3 and Cr/MSS-4. 
As for Cr/MSS-3, because Cr(NO3)3·9H2O was added to the mixture after reacting for 3h, 
micelle-silicon spheres had partly formed. Part Cr species were dispersed on the later formed 
micelle-silicon walls with the gradual generation of micelle-silicon spheres. However, there 
still were a large amount of Cr precursors that might gather and block part of the pore 
channels, which led to the reduction of SBET and Dp. 
Cr/MSS-4 was prepared by the traditional incipient-wetness impregnation, which usually 
leads to poor CrOx dispersion and pore blockage. 
4. 
Conclusions 
In this work, Cr/MSS-X catalysts were prepared using sol-gel and incipient-wetness 
impregnation method by adding Cr precursors at different preparation stages and the catalysts 
were evaluated for propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. It is found that Cr adding 
time strongly influences the surface Cr concentration, specific surface areas, Cr dispersion

and surface acidic sites. The catalytic performance of Cr/MSS-X is affected a lot by the Cr 
species and the surface acidic sites, which are determined by the dispersion of Cr on the 
catalysts. The results show that Cr/MSS-2 catalysts prepared by adding Cr(NO3)3·9H2O 
together with TEOS exhibited the best CrOx dispersion and the highest proportion of medium 
acid sites, which led to the best catalytic activity and good resistance to coke deposition. 
Although Cr/MSS-1 also showed good Cr dispersion on the surface, part CrOx species were 
wrapped in the mesoporous silica spheres center and could hardly contact with propane which 
led to weaker catalytic activity compared with Cr/MSS-2. Furthermore, the facile preparation 
method of the catalysts is easily large-scale industrially produced.

Highlights 
 
CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were synthesized by sol-gel method. 
 
Adding time of Cr precursor influences the structure and properties of Cr/MSS-X. 
 
Good catalytic properties are obtained for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. 
 
The synthesis mechanism of Cr/MSS-X is proposed.
