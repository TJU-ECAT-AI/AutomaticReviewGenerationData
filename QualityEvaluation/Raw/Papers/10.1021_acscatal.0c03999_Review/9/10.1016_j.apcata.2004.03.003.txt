Abstract
The effect of the iron distribution in steam-activated FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite on their catalytic performance for direct N2O decomposition
and for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with N2O and O2 was investigated by means of steady-state and transient pulse
experiments. Steam-activated FeZSM-5, containing a large fraction of iron as oligonuclear FexOy clusters, is more active and selective in
ODHP and direct N2O decomposition than steam-activated Fe-silicalite, where isolated iron species predominate. This suggests that the same
type of iron centers is involved in both conversions. The higher activity of steam-activated FeZSM-5 is associated to the higher mobility of
atomic oxygen species attached to oligonuclear iron species, which lead to a faster oxygen desorption in direct N2O decomposition as well
as to a faster transfer to propane in the ODHP reaction. Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites were found to be highly effective catalysts for ODHP
with N2O, with initial propene yields up to 24%. Relatively high yields of propionaldehyde are also obtained, which mainly originates from
the selective oxidation of propene. The unique ODHP performance of iron zeolites requires the use of N2O as monooxygen donor. Such
species cannot be created by O2. Only a fraction of oxygen species deposited over iron sites of FeMFI upon N2O activation was found to be
active towards propane oxidation under transient vacuum conditions. This is explained by a fast transformation of short-living highly reactive
atomic oxygen species into less reactive ones.

1. Introduction
Light oleﬁns are industrially produced by non-oxidative
catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, ﬂuid catalytic crack-
ing (FCC), the steam cracking of naphta and metathesis at
high temperatures. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of
alkanes is an alternative route to oleﬁns. The exothermicity
of this reaction enables to operate at lower reaction temper-
atures than in case of non-oxidative dehydrogenation pro-
cesses. The main challenge for oxidative dehydrogenation
processes is, however, to minimize formation of carbon ox-
ides (COx). Numerous catalytic systems have been evaluated

for ODH and the results in this ﬁeld have been recently re-
viewed [1,2]. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
(ODHP), promising formulations are based on relatively
complex systems based on molybdenum and vanadium ox-
ides. The highest propene yields reported in the literature
are in the range of 24–30%, which were achieved over
V–Mg–O oxide [3], K/Mo oxides supported on SiO2–TiO2
[4], and Ba-promoted Ni–Mo–O oxide [5] catalysts, using
O2 as the oxidant. An alternative oxidizing agent, nitrous
oxide (N2O), was also applied in ODHP over supported
vanadium oxide catalysts [6], resulting in an increased selec-
tivity to partial oxidation products as compared to oxygen.
However, relatively low propane conversions were achieved.
The oxidizing properties of N2O in hydrocarbon conver-
sions over Fe-zeolites are unique. This was triggered by the
accomplishments in hydroxylation of parafﬁns to alcohols

and of aromatic hydrocarbons to phenols over FeZSM-5
[7]. Previous studies have reported high selectivities of MFI
frameworks with iron towards oxidative dehydrogenation of
light alkanes with N2O and O2 at a low degree of hydrocar-
bon conversions (2–10%), thus achieving a low yield of the
oleﬁn (<10%) [8,9]. Recently, Nowi´
nska et al. [10] inves-
tigated the oxidation of propane over liquid-ion exchanged
M-ZSM-5 zeolites (M = Fe, Co, Mn) using O2 and N2O
as oxidants. N2O was found to be signiﬁcantly more selec-
tive for propene formation than O2, and propene yields up
to 20% were achieved over FeZSM-5 (the most active cat-
alyst), using a feed mixture of C3H8:N2O:N2 = 1:5:20. In
parallel, we have reported initial propene yields of 21–24%
during ODHP with N2O over steam-activated FeMFI zeo-
lites in a feed of C3H8:N2O:Ne = 10:10:80 [11]. These
signiﬁcant yields are comparable with the highest values re-
ported over V- and Mo-based oxides with O2. Besides, re-
markable yields towards propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have
been achieved. This novel application of FeMFI leads to
the simultaneous functionalization of propane, a relatively
cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an
environmentally harmful gas.
The aim of the present study was to derive relationships
between the forms of iron in steam-activated FeZSM-5 and
Fe-silicalite and their catalytic performance in selective
propane oxidation with N2O and O2. The nature and dis-
tribution of iron species in these catalysts differ strongly,
as concluded from detailed characterizations reported else-
where [11–14]. In parallel with C3H8 oxidation, direct N2O
decomposition was also investigated. Kinetic and mecha-
nistic insights into both reactions derived from steady-state
and transient pulse experiments have been correlated with
the iron constitution in the catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts
Details on the hydrothermal synthesis of FeZSM-5 and
Fe-silicalite have been described elsewhere [12,13,15]. The
as-synthesized samples, containing the different metals in
the zeolite framework, were calcined in air at 823 K for
10 h and converted into the H-form by three consecutive ex-
changes with a NH4NO3 solution (0.1 M) for 12 h and sub-
sequent air calcination at 823 K for 5 h. Finally the catalysts
were activated in a ﬂow of nitrogen and steam at ambient
pressure, using a partial steam pressure of 300 mbar and
30 ml STP N2 min−1 at 873 K for 5 h. Along the manuscript,
the steam-activated iron zeolites are denoted as ex-FeZSM-5
and ex-Fe-silicalite.
2.2. Catalytic tests
The catalytic tests were performed in a U-form conti-
nuous-ﬂow ﬁxed-bed quartz reactor (6 mm i.d.) at atmo-
spheric pressure. The reactor was immersed into a bed of
ﬂuidized sand, serving as a source or sink of heat. The cat-
alyst was diluted by quartz particles (three times dilution
in volume) of the same fraction (250–355 m). Thereby
quasi-isothermal operation was achieved. The temperature
proﬁle in the catalyst bed was measured using a movable
thermocouple located inside the quartz capillary in con-
tact with the catalyst. The highest temperature gradient was
15 K. The oxidative conversion of propane was investigated
using a feed of 10 vol.% C3H8 and 10 vol.% N2O in Ne
(C3H8:N2O:Ne = 10:10:80) or 10 vol.% C3H8 and 5 vol.%
O2 in N2 (C3H8:O2:N2 = 10:5:85) at 773 K and 1 bar.
For acquiring selectivities at different degrees of propane
conversion, the contact time was varied from 3 × 10−3 to
7 × 10−2 s g cm−3 by changing the amount of catalyst and
the total ﬂow rate. In order to derive additional insights
into products formation, catalytic experiments were carried
out with addition of propene (1 and 2 vol.% C3H6) to the
feed mixture containing C3H8 and N2O. The feed and reac-
tion products were analyzed using on-line gas chromatog-
raphy (HP 5890) equipped with Porapack Q and Molsieve
5A columns. The yield and selectivity of propene and pro-
pionaldehyde were calculated according to

The performance of the catalysts in direct N2O decom-
position was investigated in a continuous-ﬂow ﬁxed-bed
reactor (5 mm i.d.) using a catalyst mass of 20–35 mg
(250–355 m), and a feed of 10 vol.% N2O (Pro Narcosis)
in neon (Ne 4.5) at a total pressure of 1.5 bar. The total ﬂow
rate and reaction temperature were varied between 60 and
240 ml STP min−1 and 673 and 773 K, respectively. The con-
tact times were adjusted to keep the degree of N2O conver-
sion below 5%. This enabled a proper estimation of the initial
rates of O2 formation or N2O decomposition according to

where FT is the total volumetric ﬂow, Wcat the catalyst
mass, and C(O2) is the measured oxygen concentration at
the reactor outlet. The ratio of Wcat/FT is deﬁned as the
contact time τ, expressed as s g cm−3. The feed and product
components were analysed by on-line gas chromatogra-
phy (Chrompack CP-2002) equipped with Poraplot Q and
Molsieve 5A columns.

2.3. Transient studies
Transient experiments were performed in the temporal
analysis of products (TAP) reactor, a pulse technique with
a time resolution in the sub-millisecond range. The TAP re-
actor system has been described in detail elsewhere [16,17].
The catalyst (ca. 50 mg; 250–355 m) was packed between
two layers of quartz particles of the same size fraction
in the quartz micro-reactor (6 mm i.d.). Prior to the ex-
periments, the catalysts were pretreated in ﬂowing helium
(30 ml STP min−1) for 3 h at 773 K and ambient pressure.
The pretreated catalyst was exposed to vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa)
and pulse experiments were carried out in the temperature
range of 573–823 K. Pulses containing a small amount of
reactants (ca. 5 × 1014 molecules per pulse) were injected
via two high-speed valves into the TAP micro-reactor. Tran-
sient responses were monitored at the reactor outlet using a
quadrupole mass spectrometer (Hiden Analytical) at atomic
mass units (AMUs) related to feed components, reaction
products, and inert gas. Two types of transient experiments
were performed:
• N2O decomposition in single pulsing mode: A gas mixture
of N2O and Ne (N2O:Ne = 1:1) was pulsed into the
reactor.
• Reaction of C3H8 and N2O in sequential pulsing mode:
Gas mixtures of N2O/Ne (N2O:Ne = 1:1) and C3H8/Xe
(C3H8:Xe = 1:1) were sequentially pulsed from two dif-
ferent pulse valves at operator-speciﬁed time intervals, re-
ferred to as the time delay (t). Experiments with t =
0 s correspond to simultaneous pulsing of C3H8 and N2O.
The gases applied in our experiments, Ne (4.5), Xe (4.0),
N2O (2.0), and C3H8 (3.5), were used without additional
puriﬁcation. In both types of experiments described, pulses
were repeated 10 times for each AMU and averaged to im-
prove signal-to-noise ratio. For mass spectroscopic identiﬁ-
cation of the different compounds the following AMUs were
used: 132 (Xe), 44 (N2O, CO2, C3H8), 42 (C3H6, C3H8), 32
(O2), 30 (N2O), 29 (C3H8), 28 (CO, CO2, N2O, N2), 20 (Ne)
and 18 (H2O). The variations in feed components and reac-
tion products were determined from the respective AMUs
using standard fragmentation patterns and sensitivity factors.
3. Results
3.1. Iron constitution in the catalysts
A detailed characterization of the steam-activated iron ze-
olites used in this study, based on a multi-technique ap-
proach, has been reported elsewhere [12,13,15]. The iron
content in ex-FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31 and 0.67 wt.% Fe) and
ex-Fe-silicalite (Si/Al ∼∞and 0.68 wt.% Fe) catalysts was
very similar, although the catalyst constitution with respect
to iron (nature and distribution of species) differs strongly.
Ex-Fe-silicalite does not show a signiﬁcant degree of iron
association, and the majority of extraframework iron species
is uniform and well isolated, with a fraction of iron in frame-
work positions. Contrarily, total dislodgment of framework
iron and clustering were observed in ex-FeZSM-5. In the lat-
ter sample, extraframework isolated iron ions and oligonu-
clear iron species in the zeolite pores coexist with iron oxide
nanoparticles of 1–2 nm. Since activation conditions were
identical in both catalysts, the different iron constitution
can be attributed to the different composition of the zeo-
lite framework, which determines the extraction of isomor-
phously substituted iron and the degree of association of
extraframework iron species [13,14].
3.2. Oxidative conversion of propane
3.2.1. Transient experiments
The lifetime of the oxygen species formed on extraframe-
work iron species upon N2O activation and its reactivity to-
wards propane were investigated under transient conditions
using sequential pulsing of N2O and C3H8 in the TAP re-
actor. In this cyclic pump-probe mode, a pulse of N2O is
followed by a pulse of C3H8 after a certain time delay (t)
in the range from 0 to 2 s. This enables to probe the reaction
of C3H8 with atomic oxygen species, which was previously
deposited by N2O activation over the catalyst surface. By
varying the time delay between N2O and C3H8 pulses, the
inﬂuence of surface oxygen coverage on the propane con-
version and products distribution can be determined, provid-
ing essential information on elementary (single-event) steps
involving propane activation. The operating conditions in
the TAP reactor under Knudsen diffusion regime enable to
study purely heterogeneous reaction steps, since interaction
of molecules in the gas-phase is minimized.
At all the time delays between N2O and C3H8 pulses, CO,
CO2, and C3H6 were the only gas-phase products detected
by MS analysis at the outlet of the TAP micro-reactor. Fig. 1
shows the transient responses of N2O, C3H8, and C3H6
during sequential pulsing of N2O and C3H8 with t (0.1 s)
over ex-FeZSM-5 at 673 K. The proﬁles are normalized to
enable a better comparison of the pulse shapes. The signal

of propene is broader than that of propane and is shifted
to longer times, strongly suggesting primary formation of
propene from propane. Fig. 2 shows a decrease in propane
conversion and propene yield with an increase in the time
delay between N2O and C3H8 pulses at 673 K, revealing
the importance of the lifetime of reactive atomic oxygen
species deposited by N2O for C3H8 activation and C3H6
formation. It is clear that ex-FeZSM-5 leads to the higher
propane conversion and propene yield than ex-Fe-silicalite
at all the time delays.

3.2.2. Catalytic performance under continuous ﬂow
conditions
The performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the
oxidative conversion of propane with N2O and O2 versus
time on stream is shown in Fig. 3. The ﬁrst value in these
ﬁgure corresponds to the analysis of reaction products after
ca. 15 min on stream, denoted hereafter as the initial perfor-
mance. When N2O is used as oxidant, the degree of C3H8
and N2O conversion continuously declines in a period of
100 min, due to coke formation. The catalysts completely

recovered their initial activity after treatment in oxygen at
773 K for 30 min. This was checked by performing various
ODHP-reaction and O2-regeneration cycles. Ex-Fe-silicalite
deactivates much faster than ex-FeZSM-5. For both zeolite
catalysts, C3H6, CO, CO2, and CH3–CH2–CHO (propi-
onaldehyde) were the main reaction products detected at
the reactor outlet by GC analysis. Initial C3H8 and N2O
conversions of 52 and 86% respectively were obtained over
ex-FeZSM-5. These values are signiﬁcantly higher than
those over ex-Fe-silicalite (26 and 49%). Initial propene and
propionaldehyde yields over ex-FeZSM-5 (22 and 5.5%, re-
spectively) were also superior compared to ex-Fe-silicalite
(16.5 and 3.6%, respectively).
When O2 was used as the oxidant, a slight catalyst deac-
tivation was observed in the time scale of our experiments
(Fig. 3). However, the yield of C3H6, the main coke precur-
sor species, is much lower as compared to the catalytic tests
with N2O. Besides, only traces of propionaldehyde were
formed with O2, and acrolein was the main oxygenate with
selectivity of ca. 3%. Interestingly, ex-Fe-silicalite is more
active for ODHP with O2 than ex-FeZSM-5 (Fig. 3). For the
former catalyst, O2 conversion is nearly 100%, but a poor
selectivity towards propene and thus a low yield is obtained.
The above results clearly evidence the speciﬁcity of N2O for
achieving a high activity and selectivity of FeMFI zeolites
in the oxidative functionalization of propane to propene and
propionaldehyde.
Further insights into propene and propionaldehyde forma-
tion were derived from ODHP tests with N2O at different
contact times. Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the de-
gree of C3H8 and N2O conversion (initial, measured after
15 min on stream) and the contact time at 773 K. As ex-
pected, the degree of C3H8 and N2O conversion increases
with an increased contact time. This activity order for N2O
conversion differs from that in the selective catalytic reduc-
tion (SCR) of N2O with propane in the presence of oxy-
gen [13] at temperatures below 673 K, where ex-Fe-silicalite
showed higher activity as compared to ex-FeZSM-5. A com-
parative discussion between the results presented in this
manuscript and in [13] is however not straight forward. First

of all a near to complete degree of N2O conversion in SCR
was achieved over the both catalysts at 700 K, while the
ODHP reaction was studied at 773 K. In addition, the pres-
ence of excess oxygen prevents coke deposits in SCR, as
compared to the strong deactivation by coke in ODHP. Since
the ﬁrst analysis takes place after 15 min on stream, initial
activities cannot be strictly determined.
The selectivity–conversion relationship of ODHP over the
iron zeolite catalysts is presented in Fig. 5. The selectiv-
ity towards propene decreases with an increased propane
conversion, while the selectivity towards propionaldehyde
increases slightly. In agreement with the TAP results, this
further supports that propene is formed via direct dehydro-
genation of propane. However, propionaldehyde originates,
at least partially, from a secondary transformation propene.
This can be concluded from the C3H8–N2O reaction with
addition of propene in the feed. As shown in Fig. 6, the selec-
tivity towards propionaldehyde increases with an increased
concentration of propene in the feed mixture.
The different catalytic performance of ex-FeZSM-5 and
ex-Fe-silicalite should be associated with the different iron
constitution in the zeolites. Ex-FeZSM-5, with a signiﬁcant
degree of iron association in the active form(s) of oligonu-
clear iron species and even iron oxide clusters of 1–2 nm, is

considerably more active and selective than ex-Fe-silicalite
mainly having isolated iron ions in extraframework posi-
tions. In view of this, our strategy was to carry out a more
detailed mechanistic and kinetic analysis of the iron zeolites
in direct N2O decomposition, aiming at deriving correla-
tions between the catalytic performance in these two N2O
conversions and the forms of active iron in the catalysts.
3.3. Direct N2O decomposition
3.3.1. Transient experiments
Under vacuum conditions in the TAP reactor, ex-FeZSM-5
and ex-Fe-silicalite decompose N2O without formation of
gas-phase O2 in the temperature range of 523–673 K. Sig-
niﬁcant but non-stoichiometric amounts of oxygen were ob-
served above 773 K. Typical normalized transient responses
of N2O, N2 and O2 during single pulsing of N2O at 773 K
are shown in Fig. 7. The N2 response follows directly that
of N2O, while the O2 response is broader and considerably
shifted to longer times. Kinetically, this indicates that dur-
ing N2O decomposition, nitrogen formation is faster than
oxygen formation. This is in agreement with previous tran-
sient pulse studies of N2O decomposition over ex-FeZSM-5

in the Multitrack, a TAP-like reactor, where oxygen desorp-
tion was concluded to be a rate-limiting step in the reac-
tion [18,19]. From the oxygen transient response presented
in Fig. 7(a) and (b) it is concluded that O2 formation dur-
ing direct N2O decomposition is faster over ex-FeZSM-5 as
compared to ex-Fe-silicalite.
3.3.2. Steady-state kinetics
N2 and O2 were the only observed products during
steady-state N2O decomposition over ex-FeZSM-5 and
ex-Fe-silicalite at ambient pressure in the temperature range
from 623 to 823 K. The ratio of N2/O2 was close to 2,
according to
2N2O →2N2 + O2
(1)
The rate of O2 formation during N2O decomposition at dif-
ferent temperatures is presented in Fig. 8. The results clearly
show that ex-FeZSM-5 is more active for direct N2O decom-
position than ex-Fe-silicalite. The apparent activation energy
of O2 formation, determined from the slope of the Arrhe-
nius plot in Fig. 8, is signiﬁcantly higher over ex-Fe-silicalite
(226 kJ mol−1) than over ex-FeZSM-5 (190 kJ mol−1). In
general terms, this indicates that O2 formation during di-
rect N2O decomposition over ex-Fe-silicalite is energetically

less favorable than over ex-FeZSM-5. This result is in good
agreement with N2O decomposition experiments in the TAP
reactor described above, where, slower oxygen desorption
was observed over ex-Fe-silicalite.
4. Discussion
4.1. Role of Fe species in N2O conversions
We have recently reported [11] that steam-activated com-
mercial H-ZSM-5, containing 170 ppm Fe, showed a rather
low activity for the ODHP reaction at 723–823 K, with
propene yields <10% and only traces of propionaldehyde.
The relatively low propene yield over steamed H-ZSM-5 as
compared to steam-activated iron zeolites strongly supports
that the presence of iron in the formulation is predominantly
responsible for the observed performance, as concluded in
other N2O conversions over Fe-zeolites [7,20].
The experimental data presented in this manuscript show
that the performance (initial activity and deactivation behav-
ior) of steam-activated FeMFI zeolite catalysts in the oxida-
tive functionalization of propane depends on the nature of
the oxidant and the forms of iron in the catalyst. The activ-
ity of the zeolites for direct N2O decomposition is iron-site
sensitive too. Transient experiments in Fig. 7 can be used to
explain the higher activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O de-
composition compared to ex-Fe-silicalite. In agreement with
previous transient studies [18,19], the present TAP study has
shown that O2 formation during direct N2O decomposition
is a much slower process than N2 formation. Accordingly,
the overall reaction rate of N2O decomposition should be
limited by oxygen desorption from the catalyst surface lead-
ing to regeneration of the active site. This reaction is initi-
ated by the activation of N2O on a vacant site, leading to O∗
species (Eq. (2)). Two different mechanisms were postulated
for regeneration of the active site [21,22]; the reaction of a
second N2O molecule with the oxidized site (Eq. (3)) and the
recombination of adsorbed oxygen atoms (Eq. (4)). Some
of us concluded that O2 is mainly produced by recombina-
tion of atomic oxygen based on transient experiments in the
Multitrack, in the temperature range of 573–973 K [18,19],
while Nobukawa et al. [23] obtained experimental evidence
for Eq. (3) using an 18O-tracer technique at 693 K and atmo-
spheric pressure. Although, the mechanism of O2 formation
is not completely resolved, it is widely accepted that oxygen
desorption is a rate-determining step during N2O decompo-
sition over Fe-zeolites [18,19,23]:
N2O + ∗→N2 + O∗
(2)
N2O + O∗→N2 + O2 + ∗
(3)
O ∗+O∗→O2 + 2∗
(4)
In Section 3.3, it was shown that oxygen formation during
direct N2O decomposition under both vacuum and ambi-
ent pressure conditions is faster over ex-FeZSM-5 than over
ex-Fe-silicalite. As previously suggested [13], the above re-
sults conﬁrm that a certain degree of iron association, in the
form of oligonuclear iron oxo-clusters is required to achieve
active catalysts for direct N2O decomposition via an im-
proved O2 desorption.
The results of this paper convincingly show that at high
temperatures, the activity in direct N2O decomposition and
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with N2O correlate,
which may suggest the participation of similar iron sites.
This may be further discussed if we take into account that
the atomic oxygen species in oligonuclear species are more
mobile and reactive not only for recombination (Eq. (4)) but
also for its transfer to the hydrocarbon molecule:
C3H8 + O∗→C3H6 + H2O + ∗
(5)
Another relevant aspect derived from our study is the fact
that not all oxygen species formed upon N2O activation
participate on propane activation. This is in line with pre-
vious observations on oxygen isotopic exchange [24] and
CO oxidation [25] over Fe-MFI catalysts, precovered by
oxygen species from N2O. For these reactions, it was ob-
served that the number of deposited oxygen species by N2O
largely exceeds the number of reactive oxygen species. Our
results of sequential pulse experiments with N2O and C3H8
in Fig. 2 show that the degree of propane conversion de-
creases with an increased time delay between the N2O and
C3H8 pulses. The reason for this observation should be re-
lated to an eventual transformation of short-living highly re-
active atomic oxygen species into less reactive ones, since
no gas-phase O2 was observed in the experiments. Un-
der vacuum conditions of the TAP reactor, the zeolite ma-
trix can be reduced, therefore, oxygen species deposited
by N2O over Fe sites can be incorporated into zeolite ma-
trix. Previous experiments on N2O decomposition over Cu-
and Fe-zeolites with 18O-labeled N2O support this mech-
anism [26]. These authors assumed that N2O decomposes
over iron sites resulting in 18O species followed by its in-
corporation into the zeolite matrix. This mechanism is sug-
gested to prevail over ex-Fe-silicalite, where isolated iron
ions are mainly present. For ex-FeZSM-5 with highly clus-
tered iron species, an alternative mechanism can also be con-
sidered. Iron in oligonuclear iron species may experience
reduction from Fe3+ to Fe2+ under vacuum conditions. The
reduced Fe2+ species are easily re-oxidized to Fe3+ by oxy-
gen species deposited by N2O. Thus, the conclusion is that
the O∗species deposited on active extraframework iron sites
undergo a rapid transformation into oxygen-species (O)
with a different identity, loosing its unique catalytic pro-
perties:
O ∗+ →O + ∗

4.2. Nature of the oxidant in propane functionalization
As shown in Section 3.2, the activity and selectivity (prod-
ucts distribution) of ODHP strongly depends on the nature
188

of the oxidant applied (Fig. 3). Propene was the main oleﬁne
with both N2O and O2. However, the selectivity achieved
is very low when dioxygen is used as the oxidant. A sim-
ilar conclusion has been previously reported by Nowi´
nska
et al. [10] for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over
ZSM-5 zeolite modiﬁed by transition metals. Such an effect
of the oxidant on the catalytic performance can be associated
to the oxidant active and the nature of the activated oxygen
species. The unique ability of oxygen species formed from
N2O over FeMFI catalysts for selective oxidation has been
previously reported for various oxidative reactions [7,9,27].
Concerning dioxygen activation over different catalytic ma-
terials, both atomic (O, O−or O2−) and polyatomic ad-
sorbed species (O2−, O22−or O32−) can be formed [28].
Although, direct experimental evidence is not available at
this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species
(O, O−, O2−) are responsible for selective oxidation, while
polyatomic oxygen species (O2−, O32−) take part in COx
formation [29–31]. Due to this complex spectrum of oxygen
species, FeMFI catalysts are suggested to have lower cat-
alytic performance in the ODHP reaction with O2 as com-
pared to N2O.
Another important feature of the ODHP reaction with
N2O is the formation of propionaldehyde as the main oxy-
genate. In the presence of O2, acroleine is formed in low
amount. Panov et al. [32,33] reported non-catalytic oxida-
tion of different alkenes in the liquid phase using N2O as
oxidant. Respective aldehydes and ketons are the main re-
action products. In our study we found that the selectiv-
ity towards propionaldehyde is increased when propene is
added to the C3H8–N2O feed mixture (Fig. 6). This indicates
that oxygen species deposited by N2O over certain Fe sites
are able to selectively oxidize propene to propionaldehyde.
From the selectivity–conversion plots in Fig. 5, the possibil-
ity for direct oxidation of propane to propionaldehyde can-
not be excluded. However, this reaction route should play
a minor role in the formation of this aldehyde, since no
oxygenates were observed during TAP experiments. Based
on these data, a simpliﬁed scheme for selective routes of
propane oxidation in the presence of N2O can be suggested,
where propane is primarily converted to propene and propi-
onaldehyde, followed by secondary oxidation of propene to
propionaldehyde (Fig. 9). From our experiment it cannot be
concluded whether propene and propionaldehyde are alter-

natively formed via fast dehydration or oxidation of inter-
mediate alcohols (n-propanol, i-propanol), respectively. Al-
cohols have been previously reported to be primary formed
from different alkanes over FeZSM-5 in the presence of N2O
at room temperature [27,34,35]. However, it has to be noted
that alcohols were never detected in the gas phase. There-
fore, we assume that direct oxidation of propane to propene
and propene to propionaldehyde should be the main reaction
route of propene and propionaldehyde formation, respec-
tively. When O2 is used as the oxidant, COx is the major
product. This means that in comparison to N2O, activation
of molecular oxygen on iron species results in formation of
other oxygen species, which is not selective and leads to
total combustion of propane and propene.
Summarizing, the presence of iron is a precondition for
high activity and selectivity of FeMFI zeolites in direct N2O
decomposition as well as in the N2O-mediated oxidative
propane dehydrogenation to propene and propionaldehyde.
The structure of iron species is also a crucial feature. A cer-
tain degree of iron clustering in the form of extraframework
oligonuclear iron oxo-clusters, conﬁned in the zeolite chan-
nels, is beneﬁcial to achieve improved ODHP performances.
However, assuming that the same oxygen species is formed
from N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite, the better
catalytic performance of the former as compared to the lat-
ter cannot be only explained by the number, structure (na-
ture), and distribution of Fe species. Catalyst acidity may
play a role in the selective propane oxidation [11], as have
been already postulated for other catalytic reactions [36,37].
However, no strong conclusion can be drawn based on the
present results.
5. Conclusions
The following conclusions can be derived from this study:
• Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites are highly efﬁcient cat-
alysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative functionalization
of propane to propene and propionaldehyde. The perfor-
mance of Fe-zeolites in the reaction of propane with O2 is
poor, leading to low propane conversions and propene se-
lectivity (mainly COx formation). This further highlights
the speciﬁcity of N2O as monooxygen donor in selective
oxidations and the capability of determined iron species
in the zeolites for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen
species.
A parallel-consecutive reaction scheme for propi-
onaldehyde from propane and propene is suggested for
the oxidative functionalization of propane with N2O. The
consecutive propene transformation to propionaldehyde
is assumed to be the main reaction pathway of propi-
onaldehyde formation. This indicates a unique ability of
atomic oxygen species deposited over iron sites upon
N2O decomposition for its selective incorporation into
more reactive oleﬁnes.

• Compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, ex-FeZSM-5 shows a supe-
rior performance (activity and selectivity) in the oxidative
conversion of C3H8 with N2O, as well as a higher resis-
tance to deactivation by coking. The same activity order
was found in direct N2O decomposition, suggesting that
a similar type of iron centers are actively involved in both
N2O conversions.
• The nature and distribution of iron species determines the
catalytic performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites.
The higher activity of ex-FeZSM-5 is related to the pres-
ence of oligonuclear FexOy clusters, which favor the cat-
alytic performance as compared to extraframework iso-
lated iron ions predominant in ex-Fe-silicalite. The latter
sample also contains a certain (small) fraction of iron in
tetrahedral framework positions, which is not active.
• The higher activity of ex-FeZSM-5 for direct N2O decom-
position is related to the easier recombination of atomic
oxygen species (rate-determining step) over oligonuclear
iron clusters, which is a difﬁcult step over isolated ions.
This is concluded from the lower apparent activation en-
ergy of O2 formation in ex-FeZSM-5 during N2O decom-
position at ambient pressure and the narrow oxygen re-
sponse derived from transient experiments in vacuum.
• Active oxygen species deposited over iron centers in
FeMFI zeolites upon N2O activation possess a certain
lifetime under vacuum conditions. A fraction of these
reactive species transforms into other non-reactive oxy-
gen species. Since no gas-phase oxygen was observed,
probably reactive oxygen species ﬁlls oxygen vacancies
of the zeolite framework.
