Abstract 
A thermodynamic analysis of propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide was 
performed using constrained Gibbs free energy minimization method. Different reaction 
networks corresponding to different catalytic systems, including non–redox and redox 
oxide catalysts, were simulated. The influences of CO2/C3H8 molar ratio (1–10), 
temperature (700–1000 K) and pressure (0.5–5 bar) on equilibrium conversion and 
product composition were studied. In the presence of CO2 with a molar ratio of 
CO2/C3H8=1, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 30 K lower than that of 
dehydrogenation in the presence of steam (H2O/C3H8=1) and about 50 K lower than that 
of simple dehydrogenation without dilution to achieve 60% propane conversion. It was 
found that the occurrence of dry reforming of propane and coke forming side reactions 
could strongly impact the equilibrium product composition of the multi–reaction system 
and, therefore, these reactions should be kinetically controlled. Comparison of the 
simulated reactant conversions with those reported in the literatures revealed that the 
experimental conversion levels of propane are far below the corresponding equilibrium 
values due to rapid catalyst deactivation by coke implying that research efforts should be 
directed towards formulation of more active and selective catalysts.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Propylene is an important raw material in the production of polypropylene, 
polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. The conventional manufacturing methods 
such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a by–product do not 
meet the ever–increasing demand. Therefore, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has 
received much attention (Heinritz–Adrian et al., 2008):

Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per 
pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation. The process is endothermic and the 
thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable (Olah and Molnar, 2003). Temperatures 
above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures, 
undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates 
frequent catalyst regeneration. The use of too high contact time or temperature causes 
cracking as side reaction, therefore, proper reaction conditions are essential for selective 
dehydrogenation to occur. 
 
To reduce catalyst deactivation, coke–removing agents such as steam and hydrogen have 
been used as co–feeds in certain commercial processes. Steam controls the reaction 
temperature, serving as heat sink and enhances the selectivity.

By removing the hydrogen in the form of water from reaction 1, oxidative 
dehydrogenation proceeds to greater extent than simple catalytic dehydrogenation. 
Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative 
because it is an exothermic and non–thermodynamically limited reaction. However, the 
propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over–
oxidation of propane (Xu et al., 2006). On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon 
dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide 
(CO2–PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2 (Zangeneh et 
al., 2011). 
 
CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. Bartholomew (1984) reported that oxidizability in 
the gasification of coke was in the following order: O2(105) > H2O(3) > CO2(1) > 
H2(0.003), where numbers in parentheses indicate the relative ratios of the gasification 
with oxidants. CO2 has been called as nontraditional, unusual mild oxidant and oxygen 
transfer agent. In this sense, carbon dioxide could be proposed as an oxidant in the 
oxidative conversions of hydrocarbons. 
 
The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the 
reverse water–gas shift reaction – RWGS (reaction 2), which shifts the equilibrium of 
propane dehydrogenation to completion (two–step pathway) or its participation in direct 
oxidation of propane to propylene (reaction 3) (one–step pathway):

The oxide catalysts which are active in the non–oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are 
also active in the process with CO2. Many bulk and supported oxide–based materials 
containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et 
al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; 
Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe 
(Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane 
in the presence of CO2. Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga 
were found to be the most active and selective (Michorczyk et al., 2011). 
 
The one–step mechanism has been proposed for redox oxides (Cr2O3, Cr2O5, ZnO and 
V2O5), where CO2 can participate as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle

Redox oxides involve the transfer of electron between species by different oxidation 
states. The two–step pathway has been proposed for non–redox oxides such as Ga2O3 (Xu 
et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2005). Production of H2 could be an indication of the two–step 
pathway. 
 
Unfortunately, depending on the system conditions, many undesired side reactions can 
occur including dry reforming of propane to synthesis gas

The reverse of reactions 8 and 9 serve as coke removing reactions under appropriate 
conditions. 
 
Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst 
deactivation due to coke formation. Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few 
hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to 
Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011). 
 
Any combination of reactions 1–3 and 6–9 could be favored according to the catalyst 
formulation and operating conditions and, accordingly, different sets of equilibria could 
be approached. A suitable catalyst should favor only the desirable reaction(s). 
 
Thermodynamic analysis of possible reactions for a series of feed components is an 
important step in the design of suitable catalyst for a particular reaction (Richardson, 
1989). It provides a basis for experimental and computational studies, as well as, 
understanding the boundaries and constraints that thermodynamics imposes on process 
and catalyst development (Mawson et al., 1993). The thermodynamics of CO2 propane 
dehydrogenation has been studied earlier (Ogonowski and Skrzynska 2008; Michorczyk

et al., 2011). However, a detailed study incorporating the effect of different co–feeds and 
the effect of individual side reactions is scarce. 
 
In this work, results are presented for a detailed computational study of the chemical 
equilibria that apply to the CO2–PDH. The chemical equilibria of one– and two–step 
oxidative PDH with CO2, in the absence and presence of competing side reactions, is 
studied. The equilibrium compositions were calculated by Gibbs free energy 
minimization using Lagrange undermined multipliers method. The resulting set of 
equations was solved using Matlab software. The results were compared with available 
experimental data in the literature. 
 
2. SIMULATION AND MODELING METHOD 
Equilibrium compositions and conversions of a reacting system can be obtained by 
minimization of the total Gibbs energy Gt according to Eq. (10) (Perry et al., 1999).

For gas–phase reactions the problem is to find the equilibrium composition for given T 
and P and for a given initial feed. The objective function is subjected to the constraining 
material balance equations, based on conservation of the total number of atoms of each 
element in a system comprised of w elements. The material balance for the element k is

where Ak is the total number of atomic masses of the kth element in the feed and aik is the

Lagrange function F is obtained by addition of this sum to Gt:

present work, ideal gas assumption is adequate. 
 
There are N equilibrium equations (Eqs. 14), one for each chemical species, and there are 
w material balance equations (Eqs.12), one for each element (a total of N + w equations). 
The choice of a set of species is entirely equivalent to the choice of a set of independent 
reactions among the species. In any event, a set of species or an equivalent set of 
independent reactions must always be assumed and different assumptions produce 
different results (Perry et al., 1999).

The above formulation considers all possible reactions among the reactive species (i.e., 
reactants or products). This is appropriate for noncatalytic reactions at high temperatures 
where all reactions can proceed. However, in catalytic systems, the catalyst may promote 
certain reaction(s) among possible reactions and change the equilibrium composition 
within the time frame of interest. This can be implemented by specifying the reacting 
species and/or additional constraints (to the elemental balances) in the above 
formulations (Table 1). Each additional constraint (if any) will introduce a new term and 
λ into equation 13, with necessary modifications in subsequent equations. 
 
The required thermodynamic functions were obtained from the literature (Yaws, 1999) 
and resulting set of non–linear equations was solved by Matlab software using a quasi–
Newton method.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
According to the set of reactions considered for equilibrium calculations, very different 
equilibrium conversions and compositions could be obtained for a given feed and 
operating conditions. In this section the results of equilibrium calculations for different 
sets of reactions are presented and discussed. First of all, the one– and two–step CO2–
PDH results without side reactions are presented and compared. In subsequent sections 
propane dry reforming and coke formation are further considered in the reaction network. 
 
3.1. One– And Two–Step CO2 Propane Dehydrogenation 
For one–step reaction system, the number of chemical species (assuming no hydrogen 
fed) in the gaseous phase is 5 with one equilibrium reaction (reaction 3).  Therefore, the 
number of independent components is 4, and according to the phase rule, the degree of 
freedom is 4. For two–step reaction, the number of compounds is 6 with 2 equilibrium 
reactions, giving the same variance of 4. Consequently, by specifying T and P, the molar 
fraction of only two compounds can vary independent of others, that is, the others may be 
calculated by the thermodynamic constants of the reactions for both systems. 
 
Figure 1 shows the effect of temperature on equilibrium propane conversion with 
different diluting agents. The conversions increase with temperature because of the 
endothermic nature of the overall reactions. The simple dehydrogenation (that is, without 
diluent) is also depicted as the reference. Addition of a diluent (both inert and/or reactive) 
increases the conversion through decreasing the partial pressure of the products, and also, 
in the case of carbon dioxide, consuming the produced hydrogen. In the case of hydrogen

10 
co–feed, however, the effect is more complex. Hydrogen addition tends to increase the 
conversion through decreasing partial pressure, as other diluents, and to decrease the 
equilibrium conversion by shifting reaction 1 to the left as H2 is a product. The net effect 
is a slight drop in conversion as illustrated in Fig. 1. The highest conversion is observed 
in the case of two–step CO2–PDH. These results are closely related to the results obtained 
for dehydrogenation of propane (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003) and ethylbenzene to 
styrene (Qin et al., (2003), Sun et al. (2004)). 
 
Figure 2 shows the effect of diluent concentration at 873 and 923 K. Except for hydrogen 
diluted system, an increase in diluent concentration will increase equilibrium propane 
conversion with the highest conversion being observed for the two–step CO2–PDH. The 
one–step CO2–PDH, on the contrary, shows the lowest conversion at lower diluent 
concentrations and even no conversion at zero CO2 concentration. However, the non–
redox oxides catalyzing CO2–PDH reaction, catalyze simple dehydrogenation in the 
absence of CO2 as well, and consequently, propane conversion should be observed even 
at zero CO2 concentration. Therefore, one–step CO2–PDH equilibrium, by itself, could 
not be a good representative of the real systems especially at low CO2 concentrations and 
its combination with simple dehydrogenation should be a better approximation of the real 
systems.  These results are also in good agreement with those obtained by Michorczyk 
and Ogonowski (2003). 
 
One might note that the combination of one–step and simple dehydrogenation gives 
exactly the same results as two–step CO2–PDH since reactions 1 to 3 are not

11 
thermodynamically independent. This is not the case, however, when the reactions are 
kinetically controlled, i.e., when the reactions proceed independently by their own 
mechanism.  
 
Figure 3 shows the effect of total pressure on equilibrium propane conversion at 873 and 
923 K. The higher the pressure, the lower is the propane conversion in all cases as the 
overall conversion is accompanied with a net increase of the total number of moles. 
 
Table 2 shows the temperatures required for 50% and 60% propane conversions (typical 
commercial values) for different pathways. For 60% conversion, equimolar addition of 
CO2 to the feed reduces the reaction temperature by 54 and 29 K compared to non–
diluted and steam diluted systems, respectively, illustrating the advantage of using CO2 as 
a mild oxidant in PDH. 
 
3.2. Competitive Reforming Of Propane (And/Or Propylene) 
In the previous section only combinations of reactions involved in direct and indirect 
CO2–PDH (that is, reactions 1–3) were considered for chemical equilibrium calculations. 
The results are only applicable to systems with highly selective catalysts. An important 
side reaction could be dry reforming of propane (reaction 6). The degree of freedom of 
the system is 4 from the phase rule. Two compositions in addition to T and P are required 
to specify the system.

Figure 4 shows the effect of the temperature on the equilibrium conversion of the 
reactants and propylene selectivity for equimolar C3H8/CO2 feed at atmospheric pressure 
when propane reforming is the competing reaction. The conversion of CO2 is much 
higher than that of propane implying a rather low extent of PDH reaction. Both propane 
and carbon dioxide conversions increase with temperature due to the exothermic nature 
of the main reactions. At higher temperatures, the conversion of both reactants is nearly 
complete while the equilibrium propylene selectivity approaches 0.67. 
 
Figure 5 shows the effect of temperature on equilibrium product compositions. The 
equilibrium compositions of both CO and H2 approach asymptotically to 0.429 while 
those of propylene and water to 0.153 and zero, respectively. This illustrates that at 
higher temperatures, CO2 is involved in thermodynamically more favorable dry 
reforming of propane while propylene is obtained via simple dehydrogenation of the 
excess propane. 
 
Around 823 K, carbon dioxide conversion is nearly complete and the mole fraction of CO 
(the main oxygen containing component present) passes a maximum at this temperature. 
The subsequent decrease in equilibrium carbon monoxide concentration is simply due to 
the increase of total moles resulted from formation of lower–molecular weight 
compounds at higher temperatures. 
 
Figure 6 shows the effect of carbon dioxide concentration (yCO2) in the initial feed on the 
equilibrium conversion of propane and carbon dioxide and selectivity to propylene at 873

K when propane reforming is the competing reaction. At very low CO2 contents in the 
feed, the product distribution is same as that of simple PDH. The conversion of propane 
increases with CO2 mole fraction at the expense of propylene selectivity. The equilibrium 
CO concentration passes a maximum at CO2 mole fraction of about 0.75 (Fig. 7) 
corresponding to the stoichiometric value for propane dry reforming. This is reasonable 
as dry reforming of propane is the main carbon dioxide consuming reaction at this 
temperature. However, when CO2 concentration passes the stoichiometric ratio and no 
propane is available, part of the excess CO2 can react through reverse water gas shift 
reaction to form water. The water concentration passes a maximum around yCO2 of 0.9 
where both CO2 and H2 concentrations are sufficiently high to form water. 
 
It should be pointed out that as steam reforming of propane (another possible side 
reaction) is not thermodynamically independent of the set of reactions used in 
calculations; its effect on equilibrium conversions and compositions has been inherently 
considered. 
 
In summary, the results indicate that under typical CO2–PDH conditions, propane dry 
reforming is thermodynamically much more favored, making the product distribution 
unfavorable. This can explain why Pt–based catalysts which are widely used and 
commercialized for propane dehydrogenation have not been successfully used and not 
reported for carbon dioxide PDH. These catalysts, like most other Group VIII metals, are 
good catalysts for dry reforming of propane (Solymosi et al., 2005). Consequently, the 
selectivity to propylene should be unacceptably low over Pt–based catalysts.

3.3. Coke Formation 
Coke formation is characteristic of many catalytic reactions involving hydrocarbons and 
other carbon containing feeds such as carbon dioxide. It reduces the catalyst activity and 
lifetime. Therefore, its inclusion in thermodynamic equilibrium calculations provides a 
good assessment on the suitable reaction conditions for stable operation. 
 
When coke forming reactions are included in equilibrium calculations, the product 
compositions change dramatically. The degree of freedom is 3 for the system. Figure 8 
shows the effect of temperature on the equilibrium conversions and propylene selectivity 
for equimolar C3H8/CO2 feed at atmospheric pressure when both propane reforming and 
coke formation are the competing reactions. The conversion of propane is nearly 
complete and the selectivity to propylene is negligibly small. The conversion of carbon 
dioxide is relatively high over the range shown. 
 
The main carbon–containing product is coke, the extent of which decreases with 
increasing temperature (Fig. 9). This can be attributed to the fact that coke gasification 
reactions (the reverse of reactions 8 and 9) converting coke to CO are endothermic and 
are favored at higher temperatures. At higher temperatures (>1000 K), the mole fraction 
of both coke and CO in products approaches to 0.25 and that of hydrogen to 0.5, with 
other components being present in very small amounts. The main reactions are thus coke 
formation and propane dry reforming.

Figure 10 shows the effect of carbon dioxide concentration in the initial feed on the 
equilibrium conversion of propane and carbon dioxide and selectivity to propylene at 873 
K when propane reforming and coke formation are the competing reactions. The 
conversion of propane is nearly complete over the whole range shown while that of 
carbon dioxide decreases monotonically with increasing CO2 content in the feed. The 
selectivity to propylene is negligible. 
 
The main carbon containing product is coke over most of the range (Fig. 11). At very low 
CO2 mole fractions, the main reaction is propane pyrolysis. Upon increasing yCO2, the 
selectivity to both H2 and coke (as well as their equilibrium mole fraction) decreases 
which is due to their oxidation by CO2. Water and CO mole fractions pass peaks at yCO2 
of ca. 0.7 and 0.9, respectively. At very high CO2 concentrations, the mole fractions of 
H2O, H2 and coke become identical but smaller than that of CO indicating that when 
propane content in the initial feed mixture approaches zero the overall reaction 
stoichiometry is approximated by the following reaction

which is a combination of reactions 6 and 9. 
 
These results show that coke formation is also thermodynamically much more favorable 
than CO2–PDH and highlight again the critical role of catalyst for successful 
implementation of CO2–PDH by kinetic control of side reactions. As a consequence, 
acidic supports or oxides are not desirable as they favor cracking and coke formation 
(that is, acid coking (Richardson, 1989)). In fact, basic oxides have been favored for

CO2–PDH reaction due to the acidic nature of CO2. However, the alkali and alkaline 
earth oxides are inefficient because they form carbonate species in the presence of carbon 
dioxide (Rangel et al., 2012). Metal oxides of moderate basicity are required and must 
participate in the redox process with the reduction of carbon dioxide (Krylov et al., 
1995). 
 
3.4. Applicability To Practical Systems 
The results of the previous sections imply that equilibrium compositions obtained in the 
presence of propane reforming and coke forming side reactions are of little applicability 
to practical catalytic systems. Although these reactions are largely controlled by the 
catalyst formulation, their occurrence (especially coke formation), even to a small extent, 
can significantly affect the catalyst performance in CO2–PDH by covering and modifying 
the active sites. 
 
For proper comparison of thermodynamic simulation results with experimental data, the 
experimental system should be close to equilibrium–controlled regime for the reaction(s) 
under consideration. Therefore, among experimental data reported for a given operating 
conditions over different catalysts, only those with the highest conversion (and 
selectivity, if applicable) were selected for comparison. 
 
Table 3 shows a comparison of propane conversions for simple dehydrogenation 
(hydrogen or inert–diluted) using various diluent combinations over different catalysts 
with those obtained from equilibrium calculation. A good agreement is observed in most

cases, indicating that excellent results (close to equilibrium) could be achieved for simple 
propane dehydrogenation in practice. 
 
Unfortunately, this is not the case for carbon dioxide dehydrogenation, as shown in Table 
4. The main cause is rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation rendering precise 
conversion measurements impossible. To reduce this effect, often a higher than 
stoichiometric ratio of CO2/C3H8 is employed in experimental works and the 
measurements are performed in relatively short times–on–stream. 
 
Propane and propylene are both thermodynamically unstable under typical 
dehydrogenation conditions. Consequently, the coke removing capability of the dilunet 
plays an important role on catalyst stability. Carbon dioxide is a weaker coke removing 
agents when compared to steam. The fact that PDH with H2 (which is a weaker coke 
removing diluent compared to CO2) has been commercialized illustrates that the current 
catalyst formulations cannot effectively control coke formation in CO2–PDH. 
Consequently, much is to be done to achieve active and coke resistant catalysts to make 
use of the advantages of carbon dioxide in commercial dehydrogenation of light alkanes. 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
The effect of operating conditions and side reactions on the equilibrium conversions and 
product compositions in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide was 
studied. The inclusion of different side reactions such as propane reforming and coke 
formation which corresponds to different catalysts and operating conditions in the

reaction network results in dramatic changes in equilibrium compositions. Some 
generalization of the results could be outlined as below: 
 
Thermodynamic considerations showed that the equilibrium conversions of 
propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or 
hydrogen with two–step > one–step.   
 
The reported experimental conversion levels for one– and two–step propane 
dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be 
attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation. 
 
The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases 
propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more 
favorable than the main reaction. 
 
Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is, 
propane dry reforming. 
 
Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and 
propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions 
kinetically. 
 
Further research and development works are necessary to develop more efficient 
catalysts to realize this environmentally favorable process.
