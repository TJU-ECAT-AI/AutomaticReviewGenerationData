Abstract
Zeolite ZSM-5 of Si/Al ratio from 14 to 100, modiﬁed with transition metal ions (Fe3+, Mn2+, Co2+) introduced by means
of ionic exchange, showed catalytic activity for propane oxidation already at 330 ◦C. The use of air as oxidant resulted mainly
in carbon oxides, while application of N2O led to high selectivity towards propene. Thermal treatment of modiﬁed zeolites
was a crucial parameter inﬂuencing an oxidative activity of the samples. High activity for propane oxydehydrogenation was
found for samples calcined at 900 ◦C, while the calcination at lower temperature (600 ◦C) resulted in negligible propane
conversion. Presence of MFI structure appeared indispensable for the formation of active transition metal complexes, while
Si/Al ratio inﬂuenced activity and selectivity of catalysts less signiﬁcantly.

1. Introduction
Oxidation of light parafﬁns has attracted great at-
tention from many research groups in the past 20 years
and a large variety of different catalysts was testiﬁed
in this process. The mixed oxides [1–3] and modiﬁed
heteropoly compounds (HPC) containing molybde-
num [4–6] or tungsten [7,8] as terminal atoms have
been considered as catalysts for propane, ethane and
i-butane oxidation. Also transition metal modiﬁed
zeolites ZSM-5 were tested for the reaction oxidation
of light parafﬁns at presence of oxygen. Chang et al.
[9] showed that transition metal (Co2+, Fe3+, Cu2+,
Cu+) exchanged zeolites ZSM-5 were able to catalyse
oxydehydrogenation of ethane with oxygen already

at 400 ◦C, however, selectivity towards oleﬁn was not
very high. During last 10 years, new, very special pro-
cess of direct benzene to phenol oxidation over iron
modiﬁed zeolite ZSM-5 with N2O as an oxidant was
developed [10–13]. Panov et al. [10,11] indicated that
oxide-like iron complexes formed from the frame-
work iron species released from zeolite structure were
able to decompose N2O with formation of so-called
-oxygen. The latter was able to oxidise benzene di-
rectly to phenol. Panov et al. [10,11] have also found
that hydroxylation of methane to methanol occurred
in the presence of -oxygen under very mild condi-
tions. However, N2O decomposition over transition
metal cations may result not only in -oxygen for-
mation but also in appearance of O−oxygen species
[10,14–16]. O−species were found to be stable at
relatively high temperature and to catalyse many ox-
idation reactions. -Oxygen may be easily inserted
into hydrocarbon structure [10,11], which results in

oxygen bearing compounds formation, while O−
species were reported to facilitate oxydehydrogena-
tion reaction [10,14–16].
According to Panov et al. [10], decomposition of
N2O over iron containing zeolite ZSM-5 resulted
mainly in the formation of -oxygen. One could ex-
pect that -oxygen species may interact with hydro-
carbons resulting in the formation of oxygen bearing
compounds. Therefore, it seemed very promising to
use a transition metal modiﬁed zeolite ZSM-5 as cat-
alyst for oxidation of light parafﬁns. The presented
study was focused on the research of propane oxida-
tion over transition metal modiﬁed zeolites ZSM-5.
The inﬂuence of Si/Al ratio and the effect of oxidant
(N2O or O2) on the activity and selectivity of propane
oxidation reaction as well as the result of the use of
different zeolite matrix were studied.

propane and N2O were diluted with nitrogen (molar
ratio of propane:nitrous oxide:nitrogen = 1:5:20). Ox-
idation reaction was carried out at 330, 350, 370 and
400 ◦C for 2 or 3 h. If air was used as an oxidant, the
ratio of propane:oxygen:nitrogen = 1:5:20.
Acidity of the samples was estimated from their
activity for cumene cracking reaction at 350 ◦C. Cat-
alytic performance in cumene cracking was measured
by pulse technique in a microreactor coupled with
gas chromatograph. Acidity (presence of Brønsted
and Lewis sites) was also characterised by means of
FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine. FT-IR spectra
were recorded for self-supporting wafer of catalyst
placed in the vacuum cell and evacuated at 300 ◦C
for water removal. The evacuated samples were con-
tacted with vapours of pyridine and IR spectra were
recorded after evacuation at 100, 200, 300 and 400 ◦C
with Brucker spectrometer.
Structure of transition metal modiﬁed zeolites cal-
cined at 600 and 900 ◦C was characterised by XRD
patterns recorded with Brucker diffractometer using
Cu K radiation.
3. Results and discussion
Transition metal (Fe3+, Mn2+, Co2+) exchanged
zeolite ZSM-5 catalysed the reaction of propane with
oxygen already at 330 ◦C. However, total oxidation
was the main reaction and CO2 was the predominant
product (Figs. 1 and 2). Selectivity towards oleﬁn and
oxygen bearing products was very low and it was inﬂu-
enced by the cation introduced into zeolite channels.
Manganese modiﬁed zeolites showed relatively high
selectivity towards oxygenates (Fig. 1) and almost
no propene was observed among the products. Iron
modiﬁed zeolite ZSM-5 besides CO2 and oxygenates
resulted also in a low propene selectivity (Fig. 2).
Selectivity towards cracking products (C1 and C2 hy-
drocarbons) was very low over all applied catalysts. It
could result from high temperature treatment (900 ◦C)
of modiﬁed zeolites, which led to decrease in zeolite
acidity.
Propane oxidation with N2O over iron, cobalt and
manganese modiﬁed zeolites ZSM-5 occurred also al-
ready at 330 ◦C. However, if N2O was used as an oxi-
dant, oxydehydrogenation was a main reaction, which

run over all catalysts under study. Propane conver-
sion grew up with increase in the reaction temper-
ature, while selectivity towards propene slightly de-
creased (Figs. 3 and 4). Propane was oxidised mainly
to propene and almost no CO2 was formed at 330 and
350 ◦C. Selectivity towards oxygen bearing products
was moderate and it was inﬂuenced in some extent
by metal cation introduced into zeolite channels. The
number of oxygenates changed insigniﬁcantly with the

reaction temperature (330–370 ◦C) (Figs. 3–5). The
kind of cation introduced into zeolite channels affected
mainly the conversion of propane, while the selectiv-
ity was inﬂuenced insigniﬁcantly. Fe-ZSM-5 showed
the best catalytic performance for the oxidation reac-
tion (Fig. 6).
Process of propane oxidation may result in many
different products such as: propene (from oxydehy-

drogenation), COx (total oxidation), oxygen bear-
ing organic compounds of C3 (oxidation process),
methane and C2 compounds (from cracking process)
and ﬁnally higher hydrocarbons, which result from
oligomerisation. Composition of products depends on
the oxidant used, reaction temperature and character
of catalyst surface. Propane oxidation described in this
paper performed in the presence of N2O as oxidant

over modiﬁed zeolites of MFI structure led mainly to
propene with very low selectivity towards CO2 and
moderate amount of oxygen bearing products. Among
oxygenates, mainly compounds of C1 (methanol) and
C2 (ethanol and acetaldehyde) were found, while the
amount of i-propyl alcohol was very low and acetone
was not recorded. The C1 and C2 oxygen bearing
products resulted from oxidative breaking of C–C
bond. The cracking process led also to coke formation
and subsequent slow decrease in oxidative activity.
Propene, which was a main product of propane oxida-
tion under applied conditions can be formed both from
direct oxydehydrogenetion of propane and from dehy-
dration of earlier formed i-propanol. As far as thermo-
dynamics is concerned, the formation of i-propanol
from propane is more favourable than the direct oxy-
dehydrogenation (H: −174 and −117.1 kJ mol−1,
respectively). However, mechanism of propane ox-
idation may be inﬂuenced by many parameters and
for many catalytic systems the formation of propyl
radical was treated as a ﬁrst step of propane oxidation
[17,18]. Propene is relatively stable under conditions
applied for propane oxidation as compared to oxy-
genates. The decrease in contact time (from 2.4 to 1.2
and 0.8 s) inﬂuenced propane conversion very little
(Fig. 7), while selectivity towards propene increased
signiﬁcantly and selectivity towards oxygenates and
CO2 decreased. This may indicate that propene may

sult of interaction of propane with oxygen species to

[19–21].
The use of different oxidants for propane oxida-
tion (N2O or dioxygen), resulted in very different

products (Fig. 8). It could indicate that different oxy-
gen species were involved in oxidation reaction if
dioxygen was replaced by N2O. Panov and others
[10–13] proved that an activity of iron modiﬁed zeo-
lites for oxidation reaction involving N2O was due to
the formation of -oxygen, which resulted from N2O
decomposition over active iron complexes, so-called
-complexes. According to the quoted authors, the
presence of -oxygen should result mainly in the for-
mation of oxygen bearing products. On the other hand,
Aika and Lundsford [14,15] have shown that surface
O−species reacted with alkanes to form alkenes. Ac-
cording to these authors, reaction between alkanes and
O−species running at low temperature resulted in
oleﬁns, while at high temperature CO2 and CH4 were
formed.
When propane was oxidised with N2O over tran-
sition metal modiﬁed zeolites ZSM-5, propene was a
predominant product, while selectivity towards oxy-
genates was signiﬁcantly lower (Figs. 3–5). The re-
action of propane with N2O at 330 and 350 ◦C led
mainly to propene and some amounts of oxygenates,
while CO2 appeared among the products starting from
370 ◦C. Taking into consideration that both -oxygen
and O−species can be formed as a result of N2O de-
composition [10,16] it seems that the interaction of
O−radicals with alkane molecules is privileged under
applied conditions resulting mainly in oleﬁn forma-
tion. Presence of some amounts of oxygenates among

the products showed that also -oxygen participated
in oxidation process.
It has been determined earlier [22,23] that de-
composition of N2O results also in the formation of
monoatomic negatively charged O−oxygen species.
Tench et al. [22] have shown that N2O readily captures
an electron forming charged species of (N2O)−with
very short lifetime (10−7–10−3 s), which is decom-
posed in the following way: N2O−→(O−)s + N2.
N2O introduced on the surface containing electron
donors (for example, reduced semiconductors of
n-type) behaves in similar way and results in (N2O)−
species formation. O−is a paramagnetic species and

can be recorded by means of EPR as characteristic
signal with g-value around 2. However, on the surface
of paramagnetic solid, O−species is transformed very
fast to non-paramagnetic (O2−)s and its observation
is very difﬁcult. The O−species was easily recorded
when it was formed over solid such as MgO [14],
while attempts to observe the EPR signal from O−
radicals after adsorption of N2O on transition metal
modiﬁed zeolite ZSM-5 were not successful. Some
indirect evidence for O−formation can be found from
the product of the consecutive reaction. Konduru and
Chuang [23] have found that adsorption of N2O on
Cu-ZSM-5 may occur both on Cu+ and on Cu2+

nska et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 243 (2003) 225–236
233
ions. Adsorption of N2O on Cu2+ ion led at ﬁrst to
(O−)s formation. The following interaction with N2O
adsorbed on neighbouring Cu2+ ion results in the
formation of Cu2+(NO3−) species, which can be ob-
served by IR spectra (band at 1623 and 1565 cm−1).
Adsorption of N2O on Fe-ZSM-5 applied in this
paper besides the bands characteristic for adsorbed
N2O species [24], showed also, rather weak band at
1623 cm−1 and a very weak at 1563 cm−1 (Fig. 9).
It may be an indirect conﬁrmation of the presence of
O−species resulting from N2O decomposition over
iron modiﬁed zeolite ZSM-5.
The -oxygen has been deﬁned by Panov et al. [10]
as uncharged, monoatomic, nonparamagnetic species.
Concentration of -sites can be directly measured
from dinitrogen evolved as a result of N2O decom-
position at 250 ◦C or from -oxygen desorbed after
heating of catalyst to above 300 ◦C [25]. Sobolev et al.
[26] have demonstrated that the number of -oxygen
may be evaluated from interaction of benzene with
-oxygen at room temperature with following extrac-
tion of formed phenol with methanol and subsequent
analysis by means of gas chromatography.
It was also postulated that the activity for benzene
to phenol hydroxylation may be used as a measure

of concentration of iron -sites on the catalyst. High
concentration of -oxygen generated on iron -sites
resulted in high activity for benzene to phenol hy-
droxylation. Considering the above, the presence of
-oxygen generated in zeolites applied in this paper
was estimated from their activity for benzene to phe-
nol hydroxylation. Concentration of -sites over iron
modiﬁed ZSM-5 applied in this paper was also esti-
mated on the grounds of amount of phenol formed as a
result of benzene with -oxygen interaction (at room
temperature) and it was described in [24]. According
to quoted paper, the concentration of -sites was 6.3
and 0.3 mol g−1 for Fe-ZSM-5 (A) and Fe-ZSM-5
(B), respectively. These results are consistent with the
activity of these samples for benzene to phenol hy-
droxylation performed in continuous ﬂow reactor at
420 ◦C, which is presented in Fig. 10.
A comparison of the oxidative activity for benzene
hydroxylation resulting from -oxygen presence and
propane oxydehydrogenation due to O−species for-
mation showed in Fig. 10 indicates that the use of
different zeolite matrix (A and B, both of MFI struc-
ture) stimulates the formation of different iron com-
plexes. Iron complexes accommodated inside channels
of ZSM-5 zeolite of A group showed high activity
234

nska et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 243 (2003) 225–236
both for benzene hydroxylation and for propane ODH
reaction, which indicated N2O decomposition result-
ing in the formation of both oxygen species (-oxygen
and O−species). Selectivity towards propene and oxy-
genates resulted from the competitive interaction of
hydrocarbon with two different forms of active oxy-
gen. Iron modiﬁed ZSM-5 of B group was very active
for oxydehydrogenation of propane and almost inac-
tive for benzene hydroxylation. It brings about the con-
clusion that mainly O−species are formed over iron
complexes accommodated in channels of Fe-ZSM-5
of B group. Disparity in the activity of iron modiﬁed
samples, prepared on the base of different zeolite ma-
trix of MFI structure, for benzene hydroxylation pro-
cess was reported earlier [27,28]. According to Panov
et al. [10,11] and also other authors [30] MFI struc-
ture is indispensable for the formation of iron -sites.
It seems, however, that some other factors are also es-
sential for -sites generation. On the other hand, the
formation of O−species as a result of N2O decomposi-
tion was reported over different transition metal com-
pounds [16]. Therefore, one could expect that the MFI
structure may not be indispensable for propane oxyde-
hydrogenation with N2O as an oxidant. To answer this
question an iron modiﬁed mordenite was used as cat-
alyst for propane ODH process. It appeared, however,
that oxidative activity of iron modiﬁed mordenite for
propane oxydehydrogenation was negligible. It could

indicate that MFI structure played signiﬁcant role in
the formation of iron complexes catalysing propane
oxydehydroganation reaction performed in the pres-
ence of N2O.
It was shown earlier that thermal treatment of iron
modiﬁed zeolite ZSM-5 inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly an
oxidative activity of iron complexes formed in zeo-
lite channels. The best performance for benzene hy-
droxylation was found for samples calcined at 900 ◦C
[27–29]. Therefore, it seemed interesting to answer the
question whether the thermal treatment of iron mod-
iﬁed zeolite ZSM-5 affects the propane oxydehydro-
genation process involving O−species. Results pre-
sented in Fig. 11 indicated that the calcination of iron
modiﬁed samples at 600 and 900 ◦C brought about
very different propane conversion, while the selectiv-
ity towards propene remained practically unchanged.
Samples calcined at 900 ◦C showed propane conver-
sion from 14% (at 330 ◦C) to 24% (at 370 ◦C), while
propane conversion on samples calcined at 600 ◦C was
lower then 3%. Selectivity towards propene was in-
ﬂuenced by the temperature of thermal treatment to a
very small degree. These results suggested that ther-
mal treatment of transition metal modiﬁed zeolites
affected signiﬁcantly a number of complexes respon-
sible for propane oxidation, anchored inside zeolite
channels. It may indicate that the formation of both
-oxygen and O−species needs an iron complex,

which is formed during the high temperature treat-
ment.
The question arises whether the calcination of tran-
sition metal modiﬁed zeolite ZSM-5 at 900 ◦C affects
the MFI structure. Kim and Ahn [31] reported some
loss of crystallinity as a result of calcination at 900 ◦C.
The XRD patterns of the applied samples calcined at
500 and 900 ◦C looked very much alike, which sug-
gested that calcined samples still show MFI structure
(Fig. 12).
Considering the possible inﬂuence of acidic sites on
the oxidation reaction we could expect that Si/Al ratio
of zeolite matrix may affect the propane conversion
over transition metal modiﬁed samples. The inﬂuence
of Si/Al ratio of the parent zeolites on the activity of
modiﬁed samples for propane oxidation was not very
distinctive (Fig. 13). Some tendency of increase in se-
lectivity towards propene and decrease in propane con-
version with the increase in Si/Al ratio was observed.
It could be due to the modiﬁcation of the samples
acidity resulting from different Si/Al ratio as well as
to difference in the number of iron cations introduced
into zeolite (Fig. 13, Table 1). Acidity of iron mod-
iﬁed samples calcined at 900 ◦C was estimated from
their activity for cumene cracking (Fig. 14) and on the
grounds of IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine (Fig. 15).
It was surprising that after calcination at such a high
temperature (900 ◦C for 2 h) a number of Brønsted
acid sites enable to catalyse cumene cracking were
still present. One could expect that the Brønsted acid
sites were regenerated as a result of contact of cal-
cined samples with atmospheric moisture before being
tested for cumene cracking. The activity of the sam-
ples decreased as a Si/Al ratio increased.
The samples calcined at 900 ◦C for 2 h were also
characterised by adsorption/desorption of pyridine. IR
spectra presented in Fig. 15 indicate that the sample
of Si/Al ratio = 25 after contact with pyridine shows
marked band at 1543 cm−1 even after evacuation at
400 ◦C. As Si/Al ratio increased (50 and 100) the in-
tensity of this band decreased. Nevertheless, even for
Si/Al = 100 very weak band of pyridinium ion was
visible after evacuation at 300 ◦C.
Considering that the number of iron ions exchanged
into zeolite was strongly inﬂuenced by Si/Al ratio
(Table 1, Fig. 14: line), it seems that both parameters
(acidity and iron concentration) may inﬂuence the ox-
idative activity of the samples.
