Abstract
Dynamic effects brought about by the introduction of small amounts of CO2 and N2O in the reaction feed during the
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene on -NiMoO4 catalysts are reported. CO2 promotes oxidation proba-
bly via the formation of adsorbed oxygen species, O(a), formed by the dissociation of CO2 on NiMoO4. Catalysts in
presence of CO2 work in a high oxidation state increasing conversion. CO2 is not an inert non-selective product. It can
play an active role during the reaction. It could, via O(a): (i) oxidise propane to propene, (ii) increase the oxidation state
on the surface of the catalyst and (iii) in high concentration, promote the non-selectivity of the catalyst. In presence of
N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of
O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts. The O∗produced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane
to propene. Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic
reaction.

1. Introduction
The addition of gas promoters is already used in
some industrial applications. Gaseous dopes added to
the reactant feed of a reactor could improve activity
and selectivity and inhibit non-desirable reactions and
deactivation. However, literature is scarce on the exact
role that gaseous promoters play during the catalytic
reaction. Fundamental studies are then of high priority
in this ﬁeld. A better understanding of the mechanistic

processes in presence of dopes are then a key to un-
derstanding the real state of the catalysts during the re-
action, and to improve selectivity. The possibility that
co-adsorbate species could modify the intrinsic activ-
ity/selectivity of the surface and the pathways of trans-
formation or could play a direct role as co-catalysts
has been discussed based on indirect experimental ev-
idence [1]. The partial oxidation of benzene to phenol
on V, W, La, Mo, enriched with Pt or Pd catalysts was
studied in the presence of a mixture of oxygen and
hydrogen [2]. The direct oxidation of propylene to
propylene oxide on Ti-catalysts was performed us-
ing hydrogen as a dope [3]. CO2 has been used
as a dope in the oxidation of alkylaromatics over

Fe/Mo/borosilicate molecular sieve [4], in the syn-
thesis of methanol from synthesis gas [5] and in the
oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane over LaBaSm
oxide catalysts [6]. Recently, CO2 has been claimed
to be an effective dope in the oxidation of butane to
maleic anhydride [7]. N2O has been used as pure ox-
idant: in the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane
[8] or formaldehyde [9,10], in the transformation of
benzene to phenol [11] or in the oxidation of ethylene
to epoxide [12,13].
Our work is based on the well established fact
that the dynamic processes occurring at the surface
of oxide catalysts during oxidation reactions could
modify strongly the surface properties of the cata-
lysts. The understanding of the role of promoters on
the activity and selectivity of an oxidation process
thus requires the knowledge of the effects induced
by all the factors which could inﬂuence the architec-
ture of the active sites and the dynamic phenomena
occurring at the surface of the catalyst during the
reaction.
The aim of the present contribution is to shed light
on these aspects. It concerns the effects brought about
by the introduction of small amounts of CO2 and N2O,
in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane. Our objective is not to design new perfor-
mant catalysts but to detect any change or tendency in
the catalytic performances due to the addition of small
amounts of gas dopes. We have selected NiMoO4 as
catalysts. This catalyst (formed principally by - and
-phase) shows interesting catalytic performances and
a good selectivity. Experiments carried out by using
NiMoO4 in alkane oxidation have already shown that
a molybdenum to metal (Mo/M) ratio greater than one,
or, in other words, the presence of molybdenum ox-
ide besides metallic molybdates, enhances its catalytic
properties [14–20].
The strategy followed in this work is to carry out the
reaction in presence and absence of CO2 and N2O and
to characterise the catalysts before and after reaction in
order to correlate the catalytic activity with any change
occurring on the catalysts during the reaction and to
determine the effect of the addition of dopes on such
changes. It will be demonstrated that CO2 and N2O
are able to modify the chemical state of the active sites
of NiMoO4 under the conditions of reaction and that
the dissociation of both dopes on the surface of the
catalyst have to be taken into account to explain the
catalytic performances in their presence. Both dopes
can oxidise the propane to propene.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
Nickel molybdate was prepared from a 0.0571 M
aqueous
solution
of
ammonium
heptamolybdate
((NH4)6Mo7O24·7H2O, Aldrich, >99%) and a 0.4 M
aqueous solution of nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O,
Aldrich, >99%) (36). A 1000 ml volume of the nickel
solution was heated to 333 K in a 2000 ml vessel.
Then, 1000 ml of the ammonium heptamolybdate
solution was added drop-wise to the nickel solution
under vigorous stirring, maintaining the same tem-
perature. The pH of the mixture was kept constant at
a value of 6 by the addition of ammonium hydroxide.
After 4 h, the reaction mixture was ﬁltered and the
precipitate was dried in air at 283 K for 24 h. It was
thereafter calcined at 773 K for 4 h under 60 ml min−1
of ﬂowing oxygen (Indugas, 99.995%).
2.2. Catalytic test
Catalytic tests were performed in a conventional
ﬁxed-bed micro-reactor (Pyrex U-tube with an internal
diameter of 8 mm) operated at atmospheric pressure.
The catalysts were used as pellets with a granulome-
try between 200 and 315 m. The concentrations of
both O2 (Indugas, 99.995%) and propane (Indugas,
99.5%) in the feed were 10% by volume. Helium
(Indugas, 99.995%) was used as carrier gas. The total
ﬂow of the reactant mixture was 30 ml min−1. Cat-
alytic activity was measured in the absence and in the
presence of 3% CO2 (Indugas, 99.998%) or 300 ppm
N2O (Indugas, 99.998%) introduced as gas dope in
the feed. In order to maintain the space velocity con-
stant for all tests, the ﬂow of He was balanced so
that the total gas ﬂow was unchanged. In the case of
addition of CO2, the reaction was run at 673, 723 and
753 K for 2 h at each temperature. In the case of N2O
dope, temperature was 723 K. An additional experi-
ment was also performed, stopping the feed in N2O
and maintaining the operation conditions unchanged.
Analysis of reactants and products was continuously
performed by on-line gas chromatography (GC)

using two columns, namely a Hayesep Q column
1.5 m × 0.3 cm (100–120 m) and a molecular sieve
1.5 m × 0.3 cm (0.5 nm). Carrier gas in both columns
was helium. As the variation of performance with
the introduction of dopes was not high, replicates of
the catalytic reactions measurements under identical
conditions and using catalysts from the same batch
were performed to verify the results and to detect ten-
dencies. The measured performances were accurate
within about 1% (in relative) for the conversions of
propane and oxygen and within about 8% (in rela-
tive) for the yields in propylene and CO2. The range
of accuracy on the selectivity was thus about 10%
(in relative).
2.3. Characterisation techniques
BET surface areas, were measured using a Mi-
cromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument by adsorption of
nitrogen at 77 K on 200 mg of samples previously
degassed at 423 K for 2 h under a controlled ﬂow of
30% N2, 70% He.
XRD was performed on a Siemens D5000 diffrac-
tometer using the K radiation of Cu (λ = 1.5418 Å).
The 2θ range between 5 and 80◦was scanned at a
rate of 0.02◦min−1. Identiﬁcation of the phases was
carried out by using JCPDS database.
XPS was performed with two different instruments
depending on the samples. NiMoO4 samples were
analysed with a SSI X-probe (SSX-100/206) spec-
trometer from Surface Science Instrument (Fisons)
working with a monochromatic Al K radiation
(10 kV, 22 mA). Charge neutralisation was achieved
by using an electron ﬂood gun adjusted at 8 eV and
placing a nickel grid 3.0 mm above the sample. Pass
energy for the analyser was 50 eV and the spot size
was 1000 m in diameter, corresponding to a FWHM
(full width at half maximum) of 1.1 eV for the Au
4f7/2 band of a gold standard. For these measure-
ments, Ni 2p, Mo 3d, O 1s and C 1s bands were
recorded. The binding energies were calibrated by
ﬁxing the C–(C, H) contribution of the C 1s adventi-
tious carbon at 284.8 eV. For the quantiﬁcation of the
elements, Wagner sensibility factors were used. De-
composition of the Mo 3d doublets to Mon+ species
was done by ﬁxing an energy gap of 3.15 eV, and an
area ratio of 2–3 between the Mo 3d3/2 and the Mo
3d5/2 bands. Solutions of the decomposition were
afterwards validated by checking that the binding en-
ergies for the different Mon+ eventually found ﬁtted
with those commonly accepted and that an energy
gap of about 1.2 eV existed between corresponding
bands of two successive Mon+ species.
Diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform spec-
troscopy (DRIFTS) spectra were obtained by using
a controlled temperature and environment reﬂectance
cell (Spectra-Tech 0030-102) with ZnSe windows cou-
pled to a Brucker EQUINOX55 infrared spectrometer
equipped with an air cooled MIR source with KBr op-
tics and a MCT detector. The sample was placed in-
side the chamber without packing or dilution. A ﬂow
of 36.4 ml min−1 of He was introduced in the DRIFTS
cell during 1 h and the spectra of the original sam-
ple collected. Then the sample was heated “in situ”
to 728 K under helium, maintained 1 h at such tem-
perature and then 1% of N2O, 10% of N2O and then
synthetic air (20% O2 and 80% N2) was adsorbed
successively. All the experiments were carried out at
36.4 ml min−1 of total ﬂow of reactants. Spectra were
obtained by co-adding 200 scans at 4 cm−1 of resolu-
tion, and they are presented in absorbance mode with-
out any manipulation.
NH3-TPD was performed to determine the number
and the strength of the acid sites. The samples were
ﬁrst degassed for 1 h at 743 K under helium. There-
after, NH3 (anhydrous, Indugas) was adsorbed on the
samples at 423 K as 10 pulses of 380 l. The desorp-
tion proﬁle was recorded by GC–MS while heating
the sample at a rate of 10 K min−1 up to 743 K and
then stabilising it at this temperature for 30 min. The
quantity of NH3 adsorbed and that desorbed were
both measured by titration of the ammonia trapped
at the outlet of the reactor in a solution of boric
acid.
Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed
with a Labram spectrometer (Dilor) interfaced with an
Olympus optical microscope. The excitation radiation
was a He:Ne laser (632.8 nm) operated at a power of
10 mW. The 100× objective of the microscope was
used so that a spot of about 1 m at the surface of the
sample was measured at once. Spectra were obtained
by averaging three scans of the Raman shift range
between 1200 and 200 cm−1 recorded in 10 s with a
spectral resolution of 7 cm−1. The identity of the spec-
tra obtained at different positions of each sample was
systematically veriﬁed.

3. Results
3.1. Catalytic test CO2 as a dope
With respect to the results obtained for the tests in
the absence of CO2, the consequences of the addi-
tion of CO2 in the gas feed, which were veriﬁed in
replicate experiments, are (Table 1): (i) an increase
in the conversion of propane at 723 K (18%), an in-
crease at 673 K and no change at 753 K, (ii) an in-
crease in the yield of propene at low temperature
(18%) and a decrease at high temperature (−8%), (iii)
a decrease in the selectivity of propylene at all tem-
peratures (−10% on average), (iv) a decrease in the
consumption of oxygen at all temperatures (−10% on
average) and (v) a decrease in the yield and selectiv-
ity in CO2 (−26 and −38%, respectively, at 723 K).

CO2) and selectivity (S CO2) in CO2 obtained with 250 mg of NiMoO4 at 723 K for the different catalytic tests made successively: (a)
without N2O; (b) same conditions as in (a) but in presence of 300 ppm of N2O; and (c) same conditions as in (a) after stopping the feed
in N2O. The data plotted correspond to the performance obtained at the beginning of the test during the 1 h of reaction.
The addition of CO2 in the feed also induces forma-
tion of a small amount of a non-identiﬁed oxygenated
compound.
3.2. N2O as a dope
The addition of 300 ppm of N2O leads (Fig. 1) to:
(i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (−15%),
(ii) a modest increase in the yield in propene (11%),
(iii) an increase in the selectivity in propene (32%),
(iv) a weak decrease in the selectivity in CO2 (−7%).
Similar results are observed at all temperatures. An
important fact is that when the feed in N2O is stopped,
the catalytic performance remains unchanged com-
pared with that in presence of N2O. The performances
observed before the addition of N2O are only slowly
re-established.

3.3. Characterisation
3.3.1. CO2 as dope
The fresh NiMoO4 sample has a speciﬁc area value
of 58 m2 g−1. After reaction in presence or absence
of CO2, the speciﬁc area of NiMoO4 drops by about
40%.
Before reaction, the XRD pattern possesses all the
peaks characteristic of -NiMoO4 [21,22]. Only two
peaks, at 2θ values of 26.6 and 27.3◦, do not belong
to -NiMoO4, pointing to the presence of -NiMoO4
[21]. Independent of the conditions of reaction, the
two peaks of -NiMoO4 almost completely disappear
after catalytic test. This observation indicates without
ambiguity that -NiMoO4 is not stable during any
of the catalytic tests, regardless of the presence or
absence of CO2. The XRD peaks of the -NiMoO4
catalyst after both tests are completely identical to
those found in the fresh sample. No new oxide phase
was observed in any case.
The Raman spectrum found for the fresh NiMoO4
exhibits a combination of peaks typical of Mo–O
vibrations involving molybdenum atoms in an oc-
tahedral co-ordination (peaks at 938.1, 907.8 and
703.1 cm−1) and of peaks typical of Mo–O vibra-
tions involving molybdenum atoms in a tetrahedral
co-ordination (peaks at 955.1, 885.7 and 818.2 cm−1).
Tetrahedral peaks were attributed to -NiMoO4 [22].
After the test with or without CO2, all the peaks
corresponding to tetrahedral co-ordinations have dis-
appeared and only those corresponding to octahedral
co-ordinations remain, identically to those found
for the fresh NiMoO4. This indicates that (i) the
-NiMoO4 phase undergoes an oxidation of its struc-
ture during the tests performed both in presence or
not of CO2, (ii) the presence of CO2 in the feed does
not perturb this tendency and (iii) CO2 succeeds in
maintaining the structure of -NiMoO4 in a rather
oxidised state during the catalytic reaction.
From XPS analysis it is concluded that all the bind-
ing energies corresponding to C, O, Mo and Ni are al-
most identical for the fresh NiMoO4 and the samples
recovered after the different catalytic tests (Table 2).
In particular, no contribution in the C 1s signal for
binding energies below 283 eV, attributed to carbide
species, is found for any sample. Also, no signiﬁcant
differences in the atomic ratios are observed between
the samples. The fact that the values for the Ni/Mo

XPS atomic ratios are higher than 1 indicates an excess
of Ni with respect to the stoichiometry at the surface
of the NiMoO4 samples. The increase of this ratio af-
ter reaction could be explained by the segregation of
NiO particles towards the surface of -NiMoO4 dur-
ing the catalytic reaction. For the fresh NiMoO4, as
for the catalysts recovered after both tests, only Mo6+
species are found [22].
DRIFTS spectra of the fresh NiMoO4 sample ob-
tained at room temperature presents the following
bands in the region 760–1000 cm−1: 1000, 976, 940,
885, 823, 810 and 760 cm−1. In spite of the con-
siderable discrepancy between the IR band positions
reported in the literature for molybdenum oxide and
molybdates [24,25], which makes difﬁcult the assign-
ment of these bands, the ones observed in our sample
match the ones described by Mestl et al. [24] for
mechanically activated MoO3 which they ascribed to
MoO3 and molybdenum hydrate, suggesting that the
nickel molybdate is covered by MoO3.
The band at 1000 cm−1 is assigned to the Mo=O
fundamental stretching vibration of crystalline MoO3
[24] and those at 976, 885, 823 and 810 cm−1 are at-
tributed to vibrations of the terminal Mo=O [25]. The
existence of molybdenum hydrate can be postulated
by the presence of the band at 760 cm−1, ascribed
to a Mo–OH stretch, and that at 955 cm−1 [24,25].
When sample is heated to 728 K, a decrease in inten-
sity of the bands due to MoO3 is observed. This fact
must be related with the thermal dehydration of the
solid. No vibration band is ever found in the range
100

1450–1410 cm−1, for any of the samples analysed, the
fresh NiMoO4 and the catalysts recovered after the dif-
ferent catalytic tests. This indicates that under the sets
of conditions of reaction described in this work, car-
bonate species never form at the surface of NiMoO4
[22].
Results from the ammonia TPD show that the fresh
NiMoO4 and the catalysts recovered after both tests
adsorb similar quantities of NH3 (about 2.0 mol of
NH3 m−2) at their surface. Also, TPD proﬁles are very
similar for all the samples with the desorption starting
around 483 K, then suddenly increasing to reach an
identical maximum between 543 and 563 K, before
slowly decreasing linearly until about 783 K [22].
3.4. N2O as dope
The drop in speciﬁc area of NiMoO4 is very similar
to that of the test in presence of CO2. XRD patterns
after catalytic test are similar to that of the fresh cat-
alyst, whether the reaction is performed in presence
or in absence of N2O. The peaks corresponding to
-NiMoO4 disappear after catalytic test. No new peak
is observed [23].
The Raman spectra for catalysts, fresh and af-
ter reaction, in presence or in absence of N2O, are
essentially the same. Spectra after reaction present
only the octahedral co-ordination peaks. The peaks
corresponding to molybdenum in tetrahedral position
disappear after a catalytic test [23].
The XPS analysis results are essentially the same
as those observed in the presence of CO2, except that,
comparing with fresh catalysts, after reaction in pres-
ence of N2O, the amount of Mo5+ increases. Reduced
molybdenum is observed. The reduction of molybde-
num atoms seems induced by the presence of N2O
during the reaction. On the other hand, the C/Mo and
the O/Mo XPS atomic ratios remain nearly unchanged
(Table 3) [23].
Results from TPD-NH3 showed that desorption pro-
ﬁles are essentially similar for fresh and used samples,
in presence or absence of N2O (as in the case of the
presence of CO2) [22,23].

trace C) induces an increase in the intensity of the
bands of the molybdenum–oxygen vibrations in the
1100–500 cm−1 region. Simultaneously, a decrease in
the intensity of the bands due to stretching and bend-
ing modes of hydroxyls groups are produced (not
shown). However, no bands assigned to the adsorbed
N2O species are detected, and only gaseous N2O
bands are visible. A similar behaviour is observed
when increasing the concentration of N2O in the gas
phase to 10% (Fig. 2, trace B). It is clear that gaseous
N2O is able to interact with the surface OH groups
of NiMoO4, inducing changes in the metal–oxygen
structure. When N2O is removed from the gas phase,
reverse changes in the DRIFTS spectra are observed.
However, it is important to note that this is not a com-
pletely reversible process, since the band intensities of
the initial spectra are not fully recovered (Fig. 2, trace
D). The introduction of synthetic air in the DRIFTS
chamber has a similar but deeper effect on the spectra
than the one described for N2O. Three observations
and/or conclusions must be extracted from this ﬁgure:
(i) N2O and air exert a similar effect on the DRIFTS
spectra, increasing the intensity of the Mo–O vibra-
tions bands; (ii) such effect is not fully reversible, as
can be deduced from the remaining positive inten-
sity of the Mo–O bands after removing N2O from
the chamber and (iii) the intensity of the bands due
to Mo–O vibrations of the solid increases in the se-
quence: Helium < 1% N2O < 10% N2O < synthetic
air. From these results it could be concluded that N2O
promotes less amounts of metal–oxygen structure than
oxygen(air), namely a more reduced oxidation state

4. Discussion
4.1. The architecture of Ni molybdate
The fresh nickel molybdate sample has an XRD
pattern possessing all the peaks characteristics of
-NiMoO4. Only two peaks can be attributed to the
presence of -NiMoO4. The presence of -NiMoO4
is additionally suggested by Raman spectroscopy. The
DRIFTS experiments seem to point to the presence
of pure MoO3. No bands attributed to molybdates or
other Ni compounds were observed.
The most plausible architecture for the fresh
NiMoO4 sample consists in a mixture of -NiMoO4
phase, as the main component, and of -NiMoO4
phase as a minor component, probably both covered
on the surface by small amounts of MoO3 crystallites.
In presence or absence of dopes, -NiMoO4 phase
completely disappears after catalytic test. This obser-
vation indicates without ambiguity that -NiMoO4 is
not stable during the catalytic tests, regardless of the
presence or absence of dopes. The Raman spectrum
found for the fresh NiMoO4 exhibits a combination of
peaks typical of Mo–O vibrations involving molyb-
denum atoms in an octahedral co-ordination and in
a tetrahedral co-ordination. Peaks corresponding to
octahedral co-ordinations are more intense than those
corresponding to tetrahedral co-ordinations and are
characteristic of the -NiMoO4 phase. The peaks
in tetrahedral co-ordination are situated on reduced
-NiMoO4 matrix and on -NiMoO4 phase [22].
After the tests in presence or absence of dopes, all
the peaks corresponding to tetrahedral co-ordinations
have disappeared and only those corresponding to
octahedral co-ordinations are observed.
4.2. Attempt to explain the effects due to the
introduction of dopes
It is evident that adding certain amounts of CO2
or N2O in the feed produces important changes in
the catalytic activity. Data from the characterisation
exclude that the observed catalytic effects could be
explained by: (i) a change in the surface area, in fact in
presence and in absence of dopes the changes in BET
surface area are exactly the same, (ii) the formation of
102
F. Dury et al. / Catalysis Today 81 (2003) 95–105
a new compound: although the crystallographic phases
change during the catalytic reaction, the evolution of
the phases observed by XRD are the same whether
dopes are present or not. We remark that in all cases
the formation of a carbonate, nitrate phase or other
mixed oxide is excluded, (iii) a change in the acidity:
the results on TPD of ammonia are very conclusive:
the acidity in any case is the same. The acidity of the
catalysts is not modiﬁed by the presence of dopes.
The XPS results clearly show that, compared with
catalysts having worked in absence of dopes, N2O pro-
motes the reduction of the catalysts. On the contrary,
in presence of CO2 the catalysts work under a more
oxidised state. In presence of both dopes, changes in
the surface are not signiﬁcant, except the decreases in
the Ni/Mo atomic ratio which is easily explained by
a preferential deposition of carbonaceous species on
Ni atoms. As a consequence of all of this, the most
likely explanation of the observed catalytic results is
that both dopes succeed in modifying principally the
chemical state of the active sites of NiMoO4 under
the conditions of reaction. Our suggestion is that the
mechanism by which such modiﬁcation is realised is
via the dissociation of both dopes on the surface of
the NiMoO4.
4.3. Explanation of the effects observed in
presence of CO2
Two arguments point to an oxidating role of CO2:
(i) XPS indicates that the catalysts are not reduced in
presence of CO2 and (ii) Raman microscopy shows
that, as in absence of CO2, the tetrahedral species dis-
appear after reaction. A crucial experiment to prove
the oxidating role of CO2 was performed reacting a
reduced molybdenum phase (namely Mo8O23) with
O2 or with CO2, under exactly the same reaction
conditions. Catalysts were analysed by XPS under
very sensitive conditions [22]. The main contribution
of the Mo 3d band for the fresh Mo8O23 corresponds
to Mo6+ species. An Mo5+ contribution is also found
representing about 11% of the total molybdenum.
When Mo8O23 is submitted to a ﬂow of diluted O2
at 673 K, its surface undergoes oxidation, veriﬁed
by a lower proportion of Mo5+ found at its surface.
However, the proportion of Mo5+ species decreased
also when Mo8O23 was submitted to a ﬂow of diluted
CO2. More surprisingly, in this last case the amount
of Mo5+ is slightly smaller than when the sample is
oxidised using O2. This shows without ambiguity that
CO2 is able to oxidise the reduced Mo8O23 and, in ad-
dition and unexpectedly, that it works more efﬁciently
than O2. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that
this type of result is presented in the literature.
The difﬁculty is that thermodynamics shows that
the gas phase dissociation of CO2 to CO and O2 is
very difﬁcult or, more precisely, that it can be ex-
cluded, especially at the low temperatures used in this
work [22]. That is the reason why we suggest that the
mechanism by which CO2 promotes such oxidation
is via the formation of monoatomic oxygen species
O(a) adsorbed on the surface of NiMoO4. This species
would form by the dissociative adsorption of CO2 on
the surface of NiMoO4 following the reaction CO2 →
CO + O(a). Thermodynamics calculations shows that
the dissociative adsorption of CO2 to CO and O(a) on
Ni catalysts should proceed spontaneously under our
conditions of reaction. The free energy of formation
of O(a) was indeed evaluated to be −240 kJ mol−1 at
423 K [5]. We have no proof that such dissociation oc-
curs in our catalyst, however the dissociation has been
veriﬁed experimentally in the case of Ni, Pt, Cu cat-
alysts by several physico-chemical methods (LEED,
TDS, HREELS, TAP, etc.) [26–32]. This is an impor-
tant argument which seems to support our hypothesis.
An attempt to detect CO production resulting from
the dissociative adsorption of CO2 was made. Regard-
ing the sensibility of our equipment, no carbon oxide
was detected. This clearly suggests that the dissocia-
tion of CO2 under our experimental conditions is very
low. In spite of that, the effect of such dissociation can
be very important.
If this occurs, our results (XPS) show that one of
the roles of O(a) would be to maintain the molybde-
num sites in a high oxidation state during the reaction.
However, we cannot exclude that O(a) is also directly
involved in the oxidation of propane, as a reactant. To
further understand the oxidating role played by CO2,
an additional test was performed with only a small
amount of O2 (0.5% by volume). A test was carried
out in the absence of CO2 (TABSCO2) and another
one was carried out by adding 10% by volume of CO2
(TWITHCO2). In TABSCO2, NiMoO4 exhibits dur-
ing the 1 h of reaction an extremely high conversion of
propane (about 80%). Catalyst is very active but not
selective. Propene is not formed at all and only a small
F. Dury et al. / Catalysis Today 81 (2003) 95–105
103
amount of CO2 is produced. Propane is principally
decomposed into coke [22]. Other cracked and/or
oxygenated compounds seem to be produced (they
have not been identiﬁed successfully). After 1 h of re-
action under these conditions, the catalyst deactivates
suddenly and its conversion of propane drops com-
pletely to zero. When CO2 (10% in volume) is added
in the feed (TWITHCO2), propane is effectively con-
verted, although the conversion is low (about 2%), and
propene is produced with a high selectivity (around
66%), then the yield in propene is not negligible (about
1.3%). Moreover, contrary to the behaviour observed
in test TABSCO2, NiMoO4 does not undergo any de-
activation with time-on-stream. In TWITHCO2, cata-
lyst keeps its performances constant for several hours
of reaction. No coke is formed. These results show
unquestionably that CO2 is able to oxidise propane to
propene. Interestingly, these results are a good basis to
explain the higher performances obtained by oxidising
butane to maleic anhydride in presence of CO2 [7].
However, the catalytic test in Table 1 give another
insight. When the temperature is low (673 K), an
increase in the propene formation is observed when
adding 3% CO2. This indicates that probably, under
these conditions, the selective oxidation of propane
is favoured. When the temperature increases, the in-
crease in the conversion is not followed by an increase
in the yield of propene, indicating that under these con-
ditions the oxygen species formed is too active and se-
lectivity is not favoured. This could indicate that under
more drastic conditions (high temperature, high CO2
concentration), the oxygen generated by the dissocia-
tion of CO2 could lead either to promote the formation
of non-selective sites or to oxidise non-selectively
the propene. This result could have implications in
the control of the processes due to the non-selective
reactions (run-away in industrial oxidation reactions).
4.4. The role of N2O
4.4.1. Modiﬁcation of the surface atomic
concentration during the reaction
The possibility of a modiﬁcation in the surface
composition of the catalyst due to a metal migration
during the reaction seems to be excluded. Probably,
carbonaceous products seem to be formed preferen-
tially on Ni atoms, decreasing the Ni concentration on
the surface, as is clearly indicated by XPS analysis.
The decrease of Ni/Mo XPS atomic ratio is coherent
with this picture. The weak decrease in the O/Mo XPS
atomic ratio could be explained by the reduction of
the catalyst due to the presence of N2O, as discussed
previously. However, the same decrease is observed in
presence of CO2. What is important to underline here
is that it should not be necessary to call to some atom
migration occurring on the surface due to the pres-
ence of N2O to explain the observed results. In fact
it would be very speculative to admit that by the only
presence of N2O in the feed, such migration could
occur.
4.5. Dynamic processes involved under reaction
conditions
As has been said previously and taken into account
in the above discussion, the most likely explanation
for the observed results is that the N2O introduced in
the feed is able, as CO2 does, to modify the chemical
state of the active sites on NiMoO4 by some dynamic
processes induced under the reaction conditions.
XPS give the argument for a plausible explanation.
In the presence of N2O, molybdenum works in a more
reduced state (Table 3). Mo5+ is observed only in the
presence of N2O. The presence of 300 ppm of N2O
in the feed, promotes the reduction of molybdenum.
Contrarily, in the absence of N2O, no reduced molyb-
denum was observed. DRIFTS experiments strongly
support this result. When N2O is added, hydroxyls de-
crease and the bonds corresponding to M=O increase
further. This indicates, unequivocally, that the interac-
tion of N2O with NiMoO4 modiﬁes the nature of the
sites on the surface of the catalysts, decreasing the OH
and promoting the formation of M=O bonds. When O2
is introduced, after evacuation of the N2O, the amount
of M=O bonds formed increases further (Fig. 2). This
indicates that the number of M=O bonds in presence
of molecular oxygen is higher compared with those
observed in presence of N2O [23]. In other words, the
surface of the catalysts is in a higher oxidation state in
presence of O2. On the contrary, when N2O is added,
the oxidation of the surface is limited, it is less oxi-
dised. These results allow to suggest that, during the
reaction in presence of N2O, the catalyst is not able
to reach an oxidation state as full as in its absence. In
conclusion, N2O inhibits the oxidation, promoting a
more reduced oxidation state of the catalyst.

4.6. Mechanism by which N2O limits the
oxidation rate
It could be suggested that N2O limits the oxidation
rate of the catalysts by inhibiting the adsorption of
O2 on their surface. N2O can be adsorbed in the same
vacancies as O2. There exists, then, a competition for
the adsorption sites. The inhibition in the adsorption
of O2 can have two consequences: (i) to limit the
amount of O2−species produced by the dissociation
of O2 on the surface and/or (ii) to limit (or inhibit) the
formation of more electrophilic oxygen species (O−,
and O2−) which can be formed from the dissociation
of molecular oxygen on the NiMoO4. This proposed
mechanism of inhibition seems to explain correctly
the results observed when 300 ppm of N2O is added in
the feed. It is observed that the conversions in propane
and in oxygen decrease, the yield in propylene is lit-
tle higher and the selectivity in propylene increases
signiﬁcantly (32%). In addition, the yield and the
selectivity in CO2 decrease. These results could be
well explained admitting that some non-selective sites
(where (non-selective) electrophilic oxygen species
are formed) have been inhibited, then the conversion
decreases and the consumption of oxygen decreases
also. What is remarkable is that, in presence of N2O,
the amount of Mo5+ (and very probably the amount
of M=O, following DRIFTS analysis) is higher than
in the presence of O2. This indicates that a more re-
duced oxidation state of molybdenum (and logically
less amount of M=O) is the key point to control the
selectivity of the catalyst and that this modulation of
the oxidation state is realised by N2O during the cat-
alytic reaction. Brieﬂy, N2O inhibits the adsorption
of O2, so limiting the oxidation rate of the catalysts.
Catalysts containing less oxidised sites work better
than fully oxidised catalysts. The degree of reduction
of the catalytic sites, thus their selectivity, can be
controlled by adding N2O in the feed. In other words,
N2O “creates” or “modulates”, during the reaction,
selective sites on the surface of the NiMoO4.
4.7. Reversibility of the sites created by N2O
Another important aspect that deserves attention is
the fact that the catalytic performances observed in
presence of N2O, remain when the amount of N2O is
stopped. The effect produced by N2O is reversible, but
the reversibility is not instantaneous after the replace-
ment of N2O by O2 in the feed. This has been observed
clearly in DRIFTS experiments. The changes in the
intensity of the bands associated to Mo=O induced by
the introduction of N2O in the DRIFTS cell remain, to
a certain degree, up to 2 h after N2O has been replaced
by synthetic air (Fig. 2). This indicates that the nature
of the selective sites created by N2O is not modiﬁed
spontaneously when the N2O is not present any more
in the feed. Namely, in spite of the absence of N2O, the
sites remain in their oxidation state which is adequate
to produce propene from propane. Some time (proba-
bly hours) is needed to equilibrate the catalysts under
the new reaction conditions. This result explains why
it is necessary to maintain some amounts of N2O in
the feed to maintain the selective sites created during
the introduction of N2O [23].
4.8. The oxygen species formed by dissociation
of N2O
The nature of the oxygen species formed on the
surface of the catalyst by dissociation of N2O has
been studied extensively using surface potential mea-
surement on MoO3/SiO2 catalysts [10]. At lower
temperatures (413–553 K) and in N2O atmosphere,
N2O is decomposed following the reactions:
N2O + e−→N2 + O−
O−+ e−→O−2
This indicates that under the reaction conditions
used in our work and under steady-state conditions, the
two oxygen species can coexist on the surface. How-
ever, the amount of O2−on the surface is probably low.
As the O−species leads to total oxidation products
while the O2−leads to selective oxidation products, it
could be suggested that the presence of O2−species,
could be the responsible for the observed effects.
Anyway, we cannot exclude that the dissociated oxy-
gen (named O∗) could participate directly as oxidat-
ing reactant producing oxygenated products or more
precisely propene. This has been veriﬁed working
under high concentration of N2O. In fact in absence
of oxygen, N2O (10% in volume) is able to produce
a conversion of propane of 8.5%, propene in appre-
ciable yield (2.4%) with a higher selectivity (28.7%)
while in presence of oxygen (5% in volume (namely
the same amount of oxygen atoms)), a conversion
F. Dury et al. / Catalysis Today 81 (2003) 95–105
105
of 10% with a yield of 2.1% and a selectivity of 20.6
is observed. This result shows without discussion that
N2O could be also an oxidant to produce propene.
5. Conclusions
Both CO2 and N2O succeed in modifying the chem-
ical state of the active sites of NiMoO4 under the con-
ditions of reaction. CO2 increases the oxidation state
of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. The mechanism by
which CO2 promotes such oxidation goes via the for-
mation of oxygen species on the surface (O(a)). This
species would form by the dissociation of CO2 on the
surface of NiMoO4. O(a) is more active as oxidant
than O2. The stronger oxidating character of O(a) is
also consistent with the lower selectivity of the process
(oxidation of selective products) and with the lower
O2 consumption (as part of the oxygen atoms come
from CO2 and no more only from O2). A crucial im-
plication of our results is that, contrary to what it is
believed, CO2 is not inert in the reaction. It is not only
a non-selective product but it also modiﬁes, via O(a),
the selectivity of the catalyst.
In the presence N2O, catalytic sites work in a more
reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so
limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species
(from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts.
This explains the increases in the yield and selectivity
to propene and the lower O2 consumption when N2O
is added. It is not excluded that N2O (via the dissoci-
ated oxygen species O∗) could also participate directly
as oxidant. If this is the case, the results, in particu-
lar at high N2O concentration, must thus be regarded
as due to the superposition of both above described
phenomena.
