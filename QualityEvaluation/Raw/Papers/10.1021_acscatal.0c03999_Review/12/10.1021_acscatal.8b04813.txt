Abstract
Single non-heme Fe(II) ions present as structural moieties in several metal–organic frameworks (e.g., MIL-100, MIL-101, and MIL-808, where MIL indicates Materials of Institute Lavoisier) are identified by Kohn–Sham density functional calculations as promising catalysts for C–H bond activation, with energetic barriers as low as 40 kJ mol–1 for ethane and 60 kJ mol–1 for methane following the oxidative activation of iron. The rate-determining step is the activation of N2O and has a barrier of 140 kJ mol–1. Through consideration of the full reaction profile leading to the corresponding alcohols, ethanol and methanol, we have identified key changes in the chemical composition of the node that would modulate catalytic activity. The thermal and chemical stabilities of these materials, together with the scalability of their syntheses, make them attractive catalysts for the selective low-temperature conversion of light alkanes to higher-value oxygenates.

1. Introduction
The conversion of gaseous light hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane to liquid fuels is pivotal for economic exploitation of biogas and natural gas. (1) Such conversion would also have important environmental repercussions because it would reduce gas flaring in oil fields (estimated to exceed 140 billion cubic meters per year), (2) which occurs because the transportation of natural gas, in the absence of a dedicated pipeline, is not economically viable. Efficient catalysts able to convert methane and ethane (the two major components of natural gas) into liquid, or solid, chemical feedstock would thus constitute a turning point in the global energy supply. Given the importance of this goal, many efforts to catalyze such reactions have been undertaken, but no catalyst to date has advanced to the level of having clear potential in an industrial-scale process. (2)
C–H bonds in alkanes are apolar, implying that both heterolytic and homolytic scission pathways require aggressive reaction conditions, which brings forth kinetic challenges in selective C–H functionalization. Selective cleavage of methane and ethane C–H bonds (the enthalpies associated with the homolytic scission are 439 and 423 kJ mol–1, respectively, at room temperature) (3) thus require highly active oxidation catalysts and in many instances high temperatures and pressures are employed to improve yields. A particular challenge, however, is that the C–H bonds of initially oxidized species, e.g., alcohols are more reactive than those in the starting light alkanes, (3) making it difficult to suppress over-oxidation. (1,4) In the metalloenzyme arena, methane monoxygenases are able to selectively convert methane to methanol at room temperature and atmospheric pressure exploiting one or more copper or two iron atoms in their active sites, (5,6) but progress has been slow in translating the selectivity of the enzymes into simpler synthetic systems. (7)
From the synthetic point of view, high surface area supports have been extensively studied as matrices for the introduction of biomimetically inspired active sites. (8) Among these species, iron-based zeolites are particularly intriguing for being able to catalyze the hydroxylation of methane at room temperature, (5,9) with activity attributable to single Fe(II) sites [α-Fe(II) sites] characterized by a high-spin ground state, constrained coordination geometries, and a minimal number of ligands around Fe. (5,10,11) These three characteristics have been determined to be key for activity. The mononuclearity of the Fe active sites is distinct in reference to other metal-exchanged zeolite and metal–organic framework (MOF) catalysts, (12) especially those based on copper, in which the active species have been proven to be di- or trinuclear metallic sites. (2,13−15) However, in zeolites, the active ions are hosted as extra-framework species. Thus, although the host material is crystalline, the Fe ions are disordered and multiple species are present in the solid. (9) The relative amounts of those species and their nature can be strongly dependent on the synthetic procedure. (9,16,17) Besides decreasing the selectivity of the reaction, such disorder makes the isolation and characterization of the reacting species particularly difficult, with inactive spectator ions often the majority of deposited Fe. Indeed, the structure of the α-Fe(II) species was only recently elucidated after many years of effort. (11)
MOFs comprise a relatively new class of materials that has begun to demonstrate its utility for various applications. (18) One of their hallmarks is an intrinsic flexibility in design owing to their construction as sets of inorganic nodes interconnected by organic linkers. Thus, modulation of their chemical and physical properties can be achieved by changing their building units. Moreover, most MOFs are crystalline solids, which is a characteristic of primary importance for materials design, and MOFs have been exploited as catalysts for many different reactions. (19) In analogy to the zeolites discussed above, extra-framework iron species in MOFs have been demonstrated to be active for C–H bond cleavage (20−22) although this extra-framework character poses the same challenges to characterization and optimization that have already been discussed. (21) In other instances, iron species at structural positions of inorganic MOFs building units exhibit catalytic function with high selectivity (>80%) under mild conditions, e.g., for the conversion of ethane to ethanol for Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc)2 [also called MOF-74-(Mg,Fe); see Figure S8] (23,24) and methane to methanol for MIL-53-(Al,Fe); see Figure S9 (where MIL indicates Materials of Institute Lavoisier). (25,26) The iron species in these MOFs have different oxidation states, Fe(II) for MOF-74 and Fe(III) in MIL-53, and consequently, their mechanisms may be expected to differ, but these catalysts nevertheless share common features: in both cases, the active sites are single, non-heme iron species in octahedral environments obtained through high dilution of the iron atoms into the otherwise inert framework established with a different structural metal (note that “structural” implies that the metal is an intrinsic component of the MOF itself, not deposited post-synthetically). While promising, these materials offer room for improvement. Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc)2 is not stable in air for long time. (27,28) While MIL-53-(Al,Fe) does not suffer from similar instability, (28) it has been synthesized only in low yield using an electrochemical approach. (25) Finally, the inorganic components of both MOF-74 and MIL-53 consist of one-dimensional chains of coordinated metal sites. (23,25) Thus, to better isolate the iron atoms, in both cases, the loading in the active Fe has to be kept very low (<5 mol %). This requirement, in addition to complicating the synthesis, decreases the yield of oxygenates per mass of catalyst and has the potential to lead also to heterogeneity in active sites.
Triiron oxo-centered clusters [Fe(III)3(μ3-O)(X)]6+ (with X = OH, F, or Cl; see the central part of Figure 1) are recurrent in the structure of many MOFs, including MIL-100 and MIL-101, two MOFs characterized by exceptional chemical and thermal stability (29) and for which simple, sustainable and highly scalable synthetic protocols have been reported. (30) Interestingly, upon thermal activation, one of the three iron atoms in each node can be reduced to Fe(II) with the simultaneous elimination of the −X group and opening of one coordination site. This process has been monitored in several studies using Mössbauer (29,31) and infrared spectroscopies, (32−34) excluding the formation of Fe species in other oxidation states. These MOFs have been reported to catalyze several reactions involving C–H bond activation, using as oxidant mainly peroxides (29) and, in some cases, molecular oxygen. (35) (36) Their activity for the oxidation of light hydrocarbons, however, has not yet been reported, nor have computational predictions been made. The square pyramidal geometry of the active Fe(II) site in the MIL series is very similar to that found in MOF-74. N2O has been proven to be an efficient oxidant for the iron species in heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts to convert selectively divalent Fe species to Fe(IV)═O species, (1,9,37) but it has never been considered as an option in the previous studies on MOFs based on tri-iron oxo-clusters. Moreover, the zero-dimensionality of the MIL nodes makes MIL active sites intrinsically monodispersed: no small alkane can coordinate to more than a single iron center. This offers potential advantages with respect to the density of active sites [in principle, one Fe(II) per node, i.e., 33 mol %] that the triiron oxo-centered MOFs can present (versus <5 mol % for MOF-74 and MIL-53). In addition, the incorporation of heteroatoms in the node itself may offer the opportunity to tune Fe site reactivity, in analogy to reports for bulk (doped) metal oxides. (38,39) MIL-100 and MIL-101 have also been synthesized using metals other than Fe, particularly, Al and Cr. Mixed-metal forms of these MOFs have been also reported.

In this work, we have used Kohn–Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) and a MOF cluster model to predict the activity of the Fe(II) species in the [Fe(III)2Fe(II)(μ3-O)]6+ node for the hydroxylation of ethane to ethanol and methane to methanol. In the cluster model used, the metal node was capped using six formate groups, as in Figure 1 [Fe(III)2Fe(II)(μ3-O)(HCOO)6]. Al- or Cr-doped clusters have also been considered to assess the effect of Fe dilution on activity, i.e., having general formula of M1(III)M2(III)Fe(II)(μ3-O)(HCOO)6, where M1 and M2 = Al3+, Cr3+ or Fe3+ (M1M2Fe). We note that the Fe(III) atoms at the “other” positions on the node are similar to those reported to catalyze methane to methanol in MIL-53. (25) However, catalysis of alkane hydroxylation by Fe(III) uses H2O2 as an oxidant and involves different activation and reaction pathways (25) than for Fe(II), and we will not investigate them here.
2. Methods
Density Functional Calculations
All of the KS-DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program. (40) The cluster used to model the triiron metal node is shown in Figure 1. Formate groups were adopted as capping groups. This model has been previously demonstrated to describe the adsorption of small molecules with similar accuracy to the one obtained using larger clusters. (41) Accordingly, the reaction enthalpy from AO to B for FeFeFe is calculated to be 0.1 kJ mol–1 for a cluster saturated with phenyls, a value that is very close to −0.7 kJ mol–1 obtained for the corresponding formate model. M06-L (42) in its unrestricted formalism (U) was used in combination with the def2-TZVP basis sets. (43,44) This level of theory has previously been shown to be accurate, in comparison to multi-reference wave function theory, for the electronic structure of single iron centers in ethane and methane oxidation studies. (24) Calculations performed at the M06-L level for the interaction of probe molecules with FeFeFe accurately reproduced the experimental vibrational shifts of NO and CO following adsorption on Fe(II) sites in MIL-100-Fe (experimental values (32,34) of −55 and 27 cm–1 versus −57 and 29 cm–1 at the M06-L level, respectively), suggesting that the M06-L model properly captures the combination of donation and back-donation occurring at the Fe(II) centers in these MOFs, which will figure critically in their catalytic activity. (45)
For each intermediate of the catalytic cycle in Figure 1, the spin ladder was determined using a smaller basis set, with all-electron def2-SVP basis sets (43) on C, H, and O. Geometry optimization was carried out by means of the Berny optimization algorithm with analytical gradient and default convergence thresholds. A (99,590) pruned grid was used (i.e., 99 radial points and 590 angular points per radial point), corresponding to the grid equal to ultrafine option. All of the energetic data points have been corrected for basis set superposition error (BSSE) following the a posteriori method proposed by Boys and Bernardi, (46) as implemented in Gaussian 09. BSSE is associated with the use of a finite basis set in the calculations, and it is known to cause an extra stabilization especially for molecular complexes. The BSSE-corrected energetic values are indicated by a c superscript and were obtained from the computed Y values as Yc = Y – BSSE. The BSSE is always lower than 10 kJ mol–1 for all of the steps in the reaction mechanism.
Unscaled, harmonic vibrational frequencies were computed analytically. Enthalpies and Gibbs free energies were calculated at 1 atm and 298 K from conventional ideal gas, rigid rotator, particle in a box, and quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator partition functions except that low vibrational frequencies (<50 cm–1) were replaced by a cutoff value (50 cm–1) following the scheme suggested by de Moor et al. (47) and accounting for limitations in the harmonic oscillator approximation for very-low-frequency vibrations. (48−52) Charge and spin densities were obtained using Charge Model 5 (CM5) (53) and Hirshfeld population analysis, (54) respectively.
Multi-Reference Wave-Function Calculations
Single-point calculations at the optimized DFT geometries on A structure as in Figure 1 for FeFeFe and AlAlFe clusters were performed using the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) (55) method followed by perturbation theory to second order (CASPT2), (56) as implemented in the Molcas 8.2 program. (57) Relativistic all-electrons ANO-RCC basis sets were used for all of the atoms; (58,59) triple-ζ quality for O, Al, and Fe atoms; and double-ζ quality for C and H. The resolution of identity combined with the Cholesky decomposition was used to reduce the cost associated with the treatment of two-electron integrals. No symmetric constraints were imposed on the wave function. The active space includes all the molecular orbitals having the main contribution from 3d orbitals of the Fe centers and their valence electrons. For FeFeFe, the active space included 16 electrons and 15 orbitals (16,15), while for AlAlFe, it included 6 electrons in 5 orbitals (6,5). For the AlAlFe cluster, the convergence with the active space size was explored considering (6,10), (8,11), and (14,14) active spaces. The CASPT2 relative stability of the quintet, triplet, and singlet state does not vary significantly with the active space (see Table S28). This trend validates the use of a minimal active space for FeFeFe.
3. Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the catalytic cycle studied for ethane hydroxylation by M1M2Fe clusters (an equivalent cycle was considered for methane). Similar mechanisms have been suggested for other Fe(II)-containing MOFs. (21,24,60) The reaction sequence involves four elementary steps: (i) Fe(IV)═O formation (from AO to B in Figure 1), (ii) C–H bond activation (from C to D), (iii) formation of ethanol (from D to E), and (iv) desorption of ethanol, which corresponds to regeneration of the catalyst (from E to A). With respect to the formation of the Fe(IV)═O species, we employ N2O as the oxygen source because it is more effective and selective for Fe than other oxidants (e.g., O2), as discussed by Zecchina et al. (9) and Vogt et al., (37) although one may generate the ferryl species by many approaches. N2O enables two-electron redox oxidation cycles, whereas the use of molecular O2 as an oxidant requires four-electron reduction/reoxidation cycles. Further, there is an entropic driving force in N2O-mediated oxidation associated with N2 release during O atom transfer to form highly reactive metal-oxo species that can activate apolar C–H bonds in alkanes at low temperatures. Three transition states are of special interest: TS1 (ferryl formation), TS2 (C–H bond scission), and TS3 (alkyl radical rebound). All energetics, unless otherwise specified, are referenced to the total energy of the separated reactants (A, N2O, alkane).
The reaction profiles for methane oxidation to methanol and ethane oxidation to ethanol are reported in panels a and b of Figure 2, respectively, where the reaction enthalpies are shown. The corresponding plots displaying the Gibbs free energies values are reported as Figure S5a,b. The description provided by the enthalpies and Gibbs free energies of the effect of the cluster composition on the activity of the catalysts is fully equivalent. In the following, only the enthalpic values will be discussed to allow the most direct comparison with literature data. All relevant energy values are compiled in Tables S12–S21, and relevant electronic and geometrical parameters are compiled in Tables S1–S11. For the particular case of the AlAlFe cluster, structures of the optimized geometries along the reaction path are also shown in Figure 3.

Selected geometrical parameters are reported for optimized stationary points (only the reacting Fe center and its first coordination sphere are depicted). Color code: red, oxygen; orange, iron; blue, nitrogen; gray, carbon; and white, hydrogen.
Considering the possible spin states, all Fe and Cr centers were found to prefer high-spin configurations, as expected given the weak ligand field associated with the coordinating oxygen atoms. These energetic preferences were substantial: for example, in the A structure for AlAlFe node, the triplet Fe is predicted to be less stable than the quintet Fe by 100 kJ mol–1 at the M06-L level and by >180 kJ mol–1 at both the CASCF and the CASPT2 levels (see Tables S26 and S28); a similar difference was reported for isolated Fe(II) in MOF-74. (24) The quintet state persists as the lowest spin state along the entire reaction coordinate (i.e., there is a single-state reactivity), for both methane and ethane conversion, again in analogy to Fe(II) in MOF-74. (24) This differs with other non-heme complexes in which a spin crossing between the triplet and the quintet surfaces can occur along the reaction coordinate. (61,62)
Although the individual Cr and Fe atoms are in their highest spin state, the fully coupled high-spin state (HS) is the ground state only for the trivial case of AlAlFe (spin ground state: S = 2) and AlFeFe (S = 9/2). For FeFeFe, CrCrFe, and CrFeFe, by contrast, the most stable spin states are the ones with antiferromagnetic coupling between the M1 and M2 centers. These states correspond to intermediate spin requiring a broken symmetry (BS) treatment within single-determinantal KS DFT, namely the septet for CrFeFe and the quintet for FeFeFe and CrCrFe. For the bare cluster, the BS states are more stable than the HS state in these three systems by more than 20 kJ mol–1.
While a BS approach can provide accurate energetics, it provides a non-physical description of the spin density. (63,64) Moreover, we observed in many instances that the convergence to a particular broken symmetry solution was highly dependent on the specific initial guess of the KS determinant, making it quite difficult to follow the reaction profile reliably. In such instances, so long as the intermediate-spin state derives from relatively weak coupling of locally high-spin centers that are themselves primarily spectators to a particular process, it can be equally effective to compute the energetics of the reaction coordinate on the HS surface. CASPT2 calculations on A of FeFeFe show that all of the spin states lay within 22 kJ mol–1 (see Table S25). This suggests that following the high-spin surface is an appropriate choice. The CASPT2 results also show that the three iron centers have a different oxidation state; namely, there are two Fe(III) and one Fe(II) (see Table S26). This result is in agreement with Mössbauer measurements showing the presence of a Fe(II) center in reduced MIL-100(Fe). (29) Density functional calculations, however, indicate three equivalent Fe in an intermediate (II)–(III) oxidation state (see Table S1). The activation enthalpies associated with TS1 and TS2 for ethane computed at the M06-L level for FeFeFe were indeed found to be very similar on both the quintet and the pentadectet surfaces, with computed values for the former of ΔHTS1c= 122.8 and for the latter of 140.5 kJ mol–1 and ΔHTS2c= 28.6 and 39.0 kJ mol–1, respectively. Again, we expect similarity in these energetics because the difference between the two spin states is associated only with the antiferromagnetic coupling among the two spectator Fe centers (see the spin map in Figure S1); similar results have been obtained in other studies of catalysts involving analogous coupling among multiple iron centers. (25,65) With respect to the 11–18 kJ mol–1 lower barriers predicted on the BS surface, these may be attributable more to instabilities associated with the final BS solutions for the various stationary points than to an actual difference between reactivity on the two spin-state surfaces. In addition, the structures obtained for S = 7 and the BS S = 2 are very close (see, for example, the comparison of the AO and TS1 structures in Figure S10). However, even if the lower barriers are accurate, that suggests that calculations on the HS surface will only be more conservative in terms of predicting C–H bond activation energies, and favorable results may be taken as upper bounds to actual reactivity. In any case, noting our own testing and precedent, (25,65) the energies reported hereafter are for the HS configurations of all clusters (S = 7 for FeFeFe, S = 5 for CrCrFe, and S = 6 for CrFeFe).
N2O Activation
The first step in the catalysis is the formation of the active Fe(IV)═O species (B) from Fe(II) (A) using N2O as oxygen source. Nitrous oxide first coordinates to the Fe(II) center (AO intermediate in Figure 1) and then dissociates to molecular nitrogen through TS1 generating the ferryl.
For all AO clusters, the adsorption of N2O on the Fe(II) site was found to be exothermic by 20–30 kJ mol–1 (see Table S3). Similar adsorption energies for N2O have been reported for other Fe-based MOFs. (24,66) In all cases, adsorption at the N terminus of N2O was favored over adsorption at the O terminus but by less than 4 kJ mol–1. The geometry of N2O adsorption involves Fe–O–N or Fe–N–N angles greater than 130°, which are less acute than those reported for some other Fe(II)-MOFs, e.g., MOF-74 (120°) (24) and Fe-BTC (111°). (66) Competitive adsorption of N2O on Al3+ and Cr3+ sites was evaluated for the AlAlFe and the CrCrFe clusters. The energy of adsorption on Fe3+ sites was evaluated using a FeFeFe cluster coordinating a chlorine. With respect to Fe2+, Al3+ is not competitive for binding N2O, Fe3+ has similar affinity, while Cr3+ preferentially binds N2O by 14 kJ mol–1. N2O would saturate Cr3+ sites in a mixed Fe/Cr metal node.
The AO → B step is predicted to be exothermic (and exergonic) for all clusters. The relative stabilization of B and the corresponding reaction enthalpies of the AO → B process (ΔHAO→B) are quite sensitive to the cluster composition varying because AlAlFe (ΔHAO→B = −52 kJ mol–1) < CrCrFe < AlFeFe < CrFeFe < FeFeFe (−0.7 kJ mol–1). The magnitude of ΔHAO→B decreases on increasing the Lewis acidity of the trivalent ions (Al3+ < Cr3+ < Fe3+). (67) This result has some similarities with those reported for Fe-zeolites, in which the reactivity of monomeric active site is increased when near two vicinal aluminum sites. (68) These reaction enthalpies are all less negative than those computed previously at the same level of theory for isolated Fe(II) sites in Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc)2 (−76 kJ mol–1) (24) and Fe-BTT (−58 kJ mol–1), (21) while for Fe-BTC, in which there is a Fe–Fe bond, a less-negative ΔE has been reported (−27.6 kJ mol–1, to be compared with the values in Tables S3), (66) consistent with our noted sensitivity to coupled redox centers.
Considering the ferryl species in more detail, it has previously been noted (11,69) that the Fe═O bond is shorter and stronger in the absence of a ligand trans to the oxo thanks to the larger stabilization of the Fe 3dz2 in a square pyramidal geometry compared to an octahedral one. In Fe-BEA, (11) an unusually short Fe=O bond of 1.59 Å in the α-Fe species has been attributed to such a lack of ligands trans to O. Interestingly, the calculated Fe–Otrans distance in Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc)2 is 2.05 Å, a value decidedly larger than any predicted for the clusters computed here (see Table S1), and this weak ligation is consistent with the more exothermic formation of B reported for this MOF. (24) For species A the reactivity of the Fe(II) leading to B correlates with the partial charges on the central oxygen of the cluster Oc, q(Oc), (Tables S1 and S2 and Figures 4a and S2b; R2 = 0.95). A similar correlation was derived also for the spin density of Oc, ρ(Oc) (see Figure S2a). The CASSCF calculations (see Table S27) also confirm larger charges on Oc for FeFeFe than for AlAlFe [the systems with the largest and the lowest q(Oc) according to DFT calculations, respectively; see Tables S1].
Figure 4
Figure 4. Reaction enthalpy for AO → B, ΔHAO→B vs (a) charge of the central oxygen of the cluster, q(Oc) in A and (b) the activation enthalpy, ΔHTS1c, for M1M2Fe clusters at the UM06-L/def2-TZVP level. Best linear fits are shown as solid lines. In panel b, literature values reported for Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc)2 (74) (blue square), Fe-BTC (66) (green triangle), and Fe-BTT (21) (pink diamond), are also shown.
The activation enthalpy ΔHTS1c for AO → B is predicted to be significant ranging from 92.6 (for AlAlFe) to 140.5 kJ mol–1 (for FeFeFe). These values are larger than those reported for the same reaction in other iron-based MOFs. (21,24,66) A comparison to the activation energy reported for N2O decomposition in Fe-zeolites and corresponding onset temperatures, (70−72) suggests that this step will be feasible in the range of stability of MIL-100 and MIL-101 (up to 300 °C in air) (30,73) even for FeFeFe, in which it should start at temperatures slightly lower than 150 °C. (71) The reaction AO → B shows Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi behavior, with ΔHTS1c being linearly correlated with the reaction enthalpy ΔHAO→B (Figure 4b, R2 = 0.99). Results reported for Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc)2 also fall on this correlating line, while those reported for Fe-BTC and Fe-BTT deviate (Figure 4b), the latter deviation being consistent with the different heteroatoms in the Fe coordination shell in Fe-BTC (1 Fe, 4 O) and Fe-BTT (1 Cl, 4 N) compared with 5 O atoms. Gavi and Kulik (69) have recently verified the validity of this linear dependence of ΔHTS1c on ΔHAO→B by screening nearly 500 single Fe models. They verified that the metal–ligands plane dihedral angle can also play a role in such a correlation.
Relevant electronic, geometrical, and energetic data for B after desorption of N2 (AB) are reported in Table S2. N2 is very weakly bound to the AB clusters (adsorption enthalpy: 3–4 kJ mol–1). Interestingly, for all of the Fe(IV)═O species studied here, the spin densities, charges, and Fe–O bond lengths are identical within very small variations. All Fe=O bond lengths are 1.61 Å, which may be compared to 1.61 Å in Fe-BTC (66) and 1.63–1.64 Å in Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc)2 (24,60) (and very similar experimental values were reported for other heme and non-heme complexes). (24) Similarly, the hydrogen affinity EH of the Fe(IV)═O (as defined in section S2 of the Supporting Information), which has been suggested in previous studies (75,76) to be a good descriptor for catalytic activity for C–H bond activation, is computed to be about −80 kJ mol–1 for all clusters (see Table S2). While we do not observe much variation, such a large negative value of EH would portend low barriers for C–H bond activation, even for methane. This independence of the Fe=O bond length and hydrogen affinity on the chemical composition of the node can be explained by the dominant impact of the oxyl ligand on the electronic structure at the Fe center, as opposed to the negligible impact of the weak ligand field, equatorial oxygen ligands, and Oc. (77) This distinguishes triiron-oxo species in MIL-100 from single Fe systems having ligands with a similar strength to the oxyferryl one, and that can influence the Fe(IV)═O reactivity. (69)
C–H Bond Activation
In this step, a C–H bond of a reacting ethane/methane is cleaved to produce an alkyl radical and a Fe(III)–OH group (D). The total spin does not change because the alkyl radical is anti-ferromagnetically coupled with the Fe(III)OH (for Hirshfeld spin densities on C and Fe see Tables S6 and S7). The reaction follows a so-called σ pathway, which is typical for non-heme oxoferryl species. (24,78,79)
Structural data for all cases may be found in Tables S4–S7 (cf. Figure 3 for AlAlFe). The C–H bond cleavage step itself is predicted to be endothermic for all clusters by roughly 20 and 45 kJ mol–1 for ethane and methane, respectively (Tables S3–S7 and Figure 2). The difference among these two barriers is very close to the computed difference in absolute C–H bond dissociation energies for the two alkanes at the M06-L/def2-TZVP level, 23.8 kJ mol–1. These reaction enthalpies are slightly less endothermic than those reported previously for Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc)2 (31 and 47 kJ mol–1), while for Fe-BTT, this step was reported to be endothermic for ethane by only 2 kJ mol–1, (21) and for the highly reactive Fe(IV)═O in BEA zeolite, this step is reported to be exothermic by 16 kJ mol–1 for methane.

Activation enthalpies ΔHTS2c for the C–H bond dissociation are listed in Tables S4 and S5, along with additional electronic and geometrical data. ΔHTS2c values are very similar for all the clusters, amounting to 39–47 kJ mol–1 for ethane and 55–62 kJ mol–1 for methane, differing again by roughly the C–H bond dissociation energies of the two alkanes. The insensitivity of the C → D energy profile to the chemical composition of the node indicates the Fe(IV)═O site to be effectively isolated, suggesting no need for iron dilution to avoid undesirable polynuclear reactivity, as observed for MIL-53 and MOF-74. The C → D step does not exhibit a Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi behavior (see Figure S3), likely because the values obtained for all clusters are very close to each other. Interestingly, the predicted M1M2Fe barriers are lower than those computed at the same level of theory for Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc)2 (ΔHTS2c = 58 and to 69 kJ mol–1, respectively) albeit higher than those computed for methane in zeolite Fe-BEA (15 kJ mol–1). (11) The higher barrier for the MIL model compared to the zeolite system may be attributed to the absence of a trans oxygen ligand in the Fe coordination sphere of the latter. Such a trans ligand has been shown to decrease the strength of the forming FeO–H bond in heterogeneous catalysts. (11) Because of that, unlike in the zeolite, in which the strength of the formed O–H bond is equivalent to that of the activated C–H bond; in the M1M2Fe clusters, the O–H bond strength is about 407–412 kJ mol–1.
Alkyl Rebound
Rebound of the alkyl radical to the Fe(III)–OH group forms metal-bound ethanol (or methanol) (E) with reduction of the metal back to Fe(II) (changes in spin densities on the iron and carbon centers going from D to E are listed in Tables S6, S7, S10, and S11).
This step has low activation enthalpies (TS3), as expected for a radical rebound reaction. For Fe-BTT and Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc)2, the analogous reactions have been reported to have activation enthalpies of only 5 and 7 kJ mol–1 for ethyl, respectively. In the M1M2Fe clusters, ΔHTS3c varies from 7.8 (AlFeFe) to 0.9 kJ mol–1 (FeFeFe) for ethyl and from 10.5 (AlAlFe) to 4.7 kJ mol–1 (CrFeFe) for methyl.
Alternatives to rebound can lead to reduced activity and the formation of byproducts. If the radical desorbs from the active site (i.e., dissociates), (80) with its high reactivity it can readily react with other components present in the MOF, e.g., by abstracting hydrogen atoms from organic linkers, adding to aromatic linkers, or at sufficiently high concentrations coupling with other radicals. Enthalpies for radical desorption are reported in Tables S6 and S7 and are about −9 kJ mol–1 for methyl and −13 kJ mol–1 for ethyl. While these values are larger than corresponding ΔHTS3c values (Tables S8 and S9), they are sufficiently close to suggest that dynamical effects may permit some alkyl radicals to avoid alcohol formation via rebound.
An alternative pathway available in the case of the ethyl radical is removal of an additional hydrogen atom from the β position to form ethylene and water (see TSdes and Edes in Figure 5). This is a reaction of potential interest, as ethylene is more valuable than ethane. The relevant activation enthalpies are all lower than 24 kJ mol–1 (see Table S23 and Figure 5), leading to similar conclusions to what has been reported for MOF-74. (24) ΔHTSdesc are larger than corresponding ΔHTS3c besides for FeFeFe (in which ΔHTSdesc is lower by 3 kJ mol–1) by a margin that decreases with the iron content of the node (see Table S23).

Catalyst Regeneration
Regeneration is the last step of the catalytic cycle and requires desorption of the alcohol from the Fe(II) center. The adsorption enthalpies on the Fe(II) sites range from 77.7 to 91.5 kJ mol–1 for methanol and from 69.6 to 84.3 kJ mol–1 for ethanol (see Tables S10 and S11). These values are slightly higher than those reported experimentally for the adsorption of methanol and ethanol (81) in MIL-100-Fe (72 and 56 kJ mol–1, respectively). The differences can be related to an over-estimation of the alcohol affinity by the DFT method. Nevertheless, De Lange et al. (81) point out that the experimental values were obtained using only few data points.
The activation enthalpy for desorption is not as high as that for the formation of the Fe(IV)═O, but it is sufficiently high relative to the adsorption enthalpy of N2O (20–30 kJ mol–1), suggesting that a deliberate process for alcohol removal will need to take place before a new catalytic cycle can begin. Although steam is sometimes used in zeolites to remove alcohols, (17) experiments have indicated methanol and ethanol to be removed from MIL-100 and MIL-101-Fe without affecting the framework at 150 °C. (81) Thermal reactivation at such a relatively low temperature would be an attractive feature for catalysis.
4. Conclusions
Triiron oxo-centered clusters Fe(II)Fe3(III)(μ3-O)(HCOO)6 are structural units recurrently found in various MOFs, including MIL-100(Fe), MIL-101(Fe), MIL-127, (41,82) and PCN-250. (83) These MOFs have been extensively studied because of their thermal and chemical stability as materials for adsorption, separation, and, more recently, for catalysis. Based on Kohn–Sham density functional calculations, Fe(IV)═O units generated from the Fe(II) centers are predicted to oxidize methane to methanol and ethane to ethanol with C–H bond activation enthalpies of only 63.3 and 39.3 kJ mol–1, respectively. Such values suggest that MOFs based on triiron oxo-centered clusters are promising catalysts for these reactions under relatively mild conditions. Moreover, the Fe sites are predicted to function in an isolated manner so that it should not be necessary to dilute the Fe concentration to maintain highly catalytic activities, unlike in other Fe MOFs previously shown to carry out such oxidations. (25,84) Multi-reference calculations show that all spin states are very close in energy and that, in the system with three Fe centers, the formal oxidation states of the three Fe is Fe(III), Fe(III), and Fe(II). The highest activation enthalpy in the catalytic sequence involves the formation of the Fe(IV)═O species from N2O as oxidant (140 kJ mol–1). Doping the node with other metals (M = Al and Cr) strongly impacts N2O activation energy, while it has relatively little effect on the energetics for C–H bond activation by the Fe(IV)═O unit. A comparison of the present results to prior experimental works for MIL-100 (81) suggests that it should be possible to desorb product alcohols from the catalysts by thermal activation without compromising the structure of the MOF. Thus, MOFs based on this tri-iron oxide node merit further investigation as potentially promising catalysts for the conversion of light alkanes to alcohols.
