1. Introduction
Propene is an important raw material for producing poly-
propene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein and acrylic acid. The catalytic
dehydrogenation of propane to propene has attracted intense
attention recently since the propene production from steam
cracking and FCC is not sufﬁcient to meet the increasing needs of
the market. The present industrial process is not optimal due to the
quick deactivation of catalysts during the reaction [1,2]. The
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen has been
proposed as an alternative process. However, the selectivity to
propene is relatively low because of the over-oxidation of propane
to carbon dioxide in the reaction. Carbon dioxide is a mild oxidant
utilized in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming
and oxidative coupling of methane. The oxidative dehydrogenation
of propane by carbon dioxide has also been reported to give rather
high propene selectivity. Moreover, carbon dioxide can promote
the dehydrogenation reaction by the reversed water-gas shift
reaction over supported Cr2O3 and Ga2O3 catalysts [3–5]. However,
the stability of the catalytic reaction is still an unsolved problem,
which is fatal for industrial application.
Aromatization of propane over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts
has
been
studied
intensely
in
the
previous
decades.
The
aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional
mechanism, in which gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing
the dehydrogenation of propane while Brønsted acid sites account
for catalyzing the oligomerization of the oleﬁns thus produced and
their subsequent aromatization [6–11]. Our recent work has
demonstrated that HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalyst was
also highly active and stable for the dehydrogenation of propane to
propene in the presence of CO2, when the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5
support was increased [12–14]. The high propene yield and
superior stability were ascribed to the decrease in the number of
acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which
results
in
the
suppression
of
the
side
reactions
such
as
oligomerization, cyclization, cracking and aromatization [13].
Zinc modiﬁed HZSM-5 materials with lower Si/Al ratios
(generally below 35) are known to be another kind of effective
catalysts for the production of aromatics from light alkanes
[15,16]. The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex
scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization and ring-
closure steps. The modifying zinc cations play a key role in the
dehydrogenation of light parafﬁns, which is quite similar to that of
gallium species in Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts [17–27]. This
suggests that ZnO/HZSM-5 could be also a promising catalyst for
the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2
if the acidity of the HZSM-5 support is decreased. However, there is
little report focused on this so far.

Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 was investigated over zinc oxide
supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratios. The stability of supported ZnO catalysts for the reaction
improves with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support, while the catalytic activity shows a
contrary trend. A highly active and stable catalyst, ZnO supported on HZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 160,
was obtained, with a propane conversion of 41.5% and a propene yield of 25.8% at steady state. The
results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption reveal that the enhancement of the catalytic
stability stems from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side
reactions, such as cracking, oligomerization and aromatization. This can be veriﬁed by the fact that the
amount of coke deposited on the catalyst diminishes with raising the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support.
The promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction is observed, which can be attributed to the
reverse water-gas shift reaction. The catalytic stability is also enhanced by the introduction of CO2 to the
feed gas.

In the present work, ZnO catalysts supported on HZSM-5 with
high Si/Al ratios were prepared and their catalytic performance for
the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2
was investigated. The inﬂuence of Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5
support on the catalytic behavior of ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts as well
as the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction are also
discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
ZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios were prepared
following the procedures in the literature [28]. Typically, an
aqueous solution of H2SO4 was dripped slowly into a solution
containing 33.5 g Na2SiO39H2O, calculated amount of NaAlO2,
6.4 g tetrapropylammonium bromide and 56 g H2O. The pH value
is between 8 and 9. After being aged under stirring at room
temperature for 4 h, the mixture gel was transferred into a
stainless steel autoclave lined with Teﬂon and crystallized at
180 8C for 2 days. The products were ﬁltered, washed, dried at
100 8C, and ﬁnally calcined at 550 8C for 6 h in air. The obtained
ZSM-5 zeolites were turned into the H-form by three consecutive
ion exchanges with 1 M NH4NO3 solution at 80 8C for a total of 9 h
and subsequent calcination in air at 550 8C for 6 h.
The supported zinc oxide catalysts were prepared by impreg-
nating an aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)26H2O on HZSM-5 using an
incipient wetness method. The impregnated samples were dried at
100 8C overnight and calcined at 600 8C for 6 h in air. The obtained
catalysts are denoted as ZnO/HZSM-5(x), where x represents the
molar ratio of Si/Al. The content of ZnO in all the catalysts was
5 wt.%.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a
Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using nickel-ﬁltered Cu Ka
radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The bulk Si/Al ratios of the prepared
HZSM-5 zeolites were measured by X-ray ﬂuorescence spectrum
(XRF) on a Bruker-AXS S4 Explorer. The BET surface areas and
micropore volumes of the catalysts were analyzed by N2 adsorption
at 196 8C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument. 27Al MAS
NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker DSX-300 spectro-
meter at a resonance frequency of 78.2 MHz. Spectra were recorded
at a spinning rate of 12 kHz, a pulse length of 0.31 ms and a delay
time of 0.5 s. All the samples were hydrated in a desiccator over a
saturated NaCl solution for 3 days prior to the measurements. The
surface acidity was measured by temperature-programmed deso-
rption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) in a ﬂow-type ﬁxed-bed reactor at ambient
pressure. A 100-mgsamplewas preheatedat 550 8C for2 h,and then
cooled to 120 8C in ﬂowing helium. At this temperature, sufﬁcient
pulses of ammonia were injected until adsorption saturation
occurred, followed by purging with helium for 2 h. The temperature
was then raised from 120 to 600 8C at a rate of 10 8C min1, and the
ammonia desorbed was collected in a liquid nitrogen trap and
detected by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a
TCD. FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on the catalysts were
recorded on a Nicolet Nexus 470 FT-IR spectrometer furnished with
an in situ sample cell. A self-supporting disk of the sample (ca.
10 mg) was pretreated at 300 8C for 4 h under a vacuum of 102 Pa
and then cooled to room temperature. FT-IR spectra were recorded
after pyridine adsorption at room temperature for 30 min and
evacuation at a desired temperature (100–300 8C) for 30 min.
Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted in ﬂowing air on
a PerkinElmer TGA 7 to determine the amount of coke deposited on
the catalyst after reaction.
2.3. Reaction testing
Catalytic tests for propane dehydrogenation were performed
at 600 8C in a ﬁxed-bed ﬂow microreactor at atmospheric
pressure. The catalyst load was 200 mg, and it was activated at
600 8C for 1 h in nitrogen ﬂow prior to the reaction. The gas
reactant contained 2.5 vol% propane, 5 vol% carbon dioxide and
balancing nitrogen, unless otherwise stated. The total ﬂow rate of
the gas reactant is 20 ml min1. The hydrocarbon reaction
products were analyzed using an on-line GC equipped with a 6-
m packed column of Porapak Q and a FID. The gas products,
including CO and CO2, were analyzed on-line by another GC
equipped with a 2-m packed column of carbon molecular sieve
601 and a TCD. The reverse water-gas shift reaction on the ZnO/
HZSM-5 catalyst was run in the same microreactor at atmospheric
pressure. The catalyst load was 200 mg. For the reaction, the total
ﬂow rate of the gas reactant is 20 ml min1, in which H2/CO2/N2
molar ratio is 1/1/18. The reaction temperature is in the range of
500–600 8C. The amounts of CO2 before and after the reaction
were analyzed on-line by a GC equipped with a column of carbon
molecular sieve 601 and a TCD.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The HZSM-5 supports with different Si/Al ratios were prepared
by a hydrothermal method and their XRD patterns after supporting
zinc oxide are shown in Fig. 1. Five diffraction peaks characteristic
of MFI structure at 2u = 8.08, 8.98, 23.18, 23.38 and 24.08 are
observed on the patterns of all the samples. The peak intensities of
the samples are almost the same except for those with Si/Al ratios
of 201 and 242, whose crystallinity is slightly lower than that of the
others. No characteristic peaks of zinc oxide appeared on the XRD
patterns, showing that zinc oxide is well dispersed on the supports.
The composition and textural properties of the supported zinc
oxide catalysts are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the
bulk Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 supports measured by XRF is close to
that of the initial gel, indicating that the majority of the added Al
and Si species is incorporated into the framework of the zeolite
during the synthesis. The BET surface areas and micropore volumes
of the HZSM-5 supported samples are in the range of 300–
344 m2 g1 and 0.14–0.16 cm3 g1, respectively, showing that the
micropore channel of HZSM-5 support was not blocked by the
supported ZnO species.

27Al MAS NMR has been shown to be a powerful technique in
the characterization of the local coordination environment of
aluminum atoms in zeolites. Fig. 2 depicts the 27Al MAS NMR
spectra of the HZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios. An
intense signal at 54 ppm assigned to 4-coordinate aluminum in
the HZSM-5 zeolite framework and a weak one at 0 ppm from
extra-framework 6-coordinate aluminum are observed. The
intensity of the framework aluminum in all the samples appears
much greater than that of extra-framework aluminum, indicating
that most of the Al atoms are located in the framework of the
zeolite.
3.2. Acidity measurements
The acidity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts was
investigated by the NH3-TPD method, and the results are
summarized in Table 2. There is a broad asymmetric NH3
desorption peak on the TPD proﬁles of all the supported zinc
oxide catalysts (not shown here). NH3 molecules desorbing
between 120 and 350 8C correspond to acidity with weak acid
strength,
and
those
desorbing
between
350
and
600 8C
correspond to acidity with strong acid strength. The number
of weak and strong acid sites decreases quickly with increasing
the Si/Al ratio of the support from 60 to 201, and diminishes a
bit with further increase of the Si/Al ratio from 201 to 242.
Similar
phenomenon
was
observed
on
the
Ga2O3/HZSM-5
catalysts [14].
The nature of the acid sites on HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts
was measured in situ by FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on the
catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3, the band detected at 1544 cm1 is
ascribed to pyridine adsorbed on Brønsted acid sites, whereas the
bands assigned to pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites were
recorded at 1451 and 1610 cm1. The band at 1490 cm1 is
attributed to pyridine adsorbed on both Brønsted and Lewis acid
sites. Brønsted and Lewis acidities are quantiﬁed into the
integrated areas of the absorbance peaks at 1544 and
at
1451 cm1, respectively, after calibrating the molar extinction
coefﬁcients of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites (the ratio of former to
latter = 1:1.5 [29]). As presented in Fig. 4, Lewis acidity is much
greater than Brønsted acidity for all the catalysts, which results
from high Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support and introduction of
ZnO to the support. It has been reported that supporting ZnO on
HZSM-5 leads to an increased number of Lewis acid sites and a
decreased number of Brønsted acid sites [19]. As the Si/Al ratio of
the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and
Brønsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD
results. When the Si/Al ratio reaches 201 and above, Brønsted
acidity is undetectable. This is understandable since the presence
of Brønsted sites on HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts should
be directly related to the framework Al species, which is reduced
with raising the Si/Al ratio.
3.3. Catalytic performance
Dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 was carried
out at 600 8C over various HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts.
The results are given in Fig. 5 and Table 3. The initial propane
conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, suggesting that
the acidities of the supported zinc oxide catalysts have a great effect
on their dehydrogenation activity. ZnO/HZSM-5(60), which is the
most acidic one according to the results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR
spectra of adsorbed pyridine, has the highest initial activity. In
contrast, the initial propene selectivity increases with raising the Si/
Al ratio. As a consequence, the initial propene yield has the sequence
of
ZnO/HZSM-5(160) > ZnO/HZSM-5(201) > ZnO/HZSM-5(120) >
ZnO/HZSM-5(242) > ZnO/HZSM-5(60). For all the catalysts, the
propane conversion drops with reaction time and almost reaches

steady state in 30 h. The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity
becomes lower for those catalysts with Si/Al ratio higher than 160,
indicating that the catalyst stability improves as the catalyst acidity
decreases. This can also be veriﬁed by the coke deposited on the
catalystsafterreacting for30 h (Table3).Noticeably,the ZnO/HZSM-
5(160) catalyst gives the best performance, with the highest steady
propane conversion (41.5%), the highest steady propene yield
(25.8%) and superior stability in the presence of CO2.
It is widely recognized that the dehydrogenation of light
alkanes over zinc-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts proceeds through a
bifunctional mechanism. Using DFT calculations, Pidko et al. [27]
have proposed more recently that ethane is most likely to be
dissociatively adsorbed on zinc oxide sites at the initial step
(Eq. (1)), followed by the decomposition of the resulting product
via one-step elimination of H2 and C2H4 (Eq. (2)). The activation
energy of this elimination reaction is strongly dependent on the
relative position of [Zn–C2H5]+ and framework attached H+ ions.
Therefore, the presence of acidic protons in the catalyst can
promote the regeneration of the active sites, leading to an increase
in activity [27].

ð2Þ
Similar conclusion could be adopted for the dehydrogenation of
propane. As the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support increases, the
possibility of occurrence of H+ ions close to the [Zn-C3H7]+ species
in ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst decreases, resulting in the diminishment
of its initial activity. On the other hand, the side reactions, such as
cracking, oligomerization and cyclization, also take place on the
acid sites. It is well believed that the catalyst deactivation in
dehydrogenation reactions is generally attributed to the coke
deposition on the catalyst surface. Thus, inhibiting these side
reactions through decreasing the number of acid sites present on
the catalyst would improve the propene selectivity and the catalyst
stability for propane dehydrogenation. This is the reason why the
initial selectivity to propene and the catalyst stability are
signiﬁcantly enhanced by reducing the amount of strong acid
sites which results from increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5
support. Thus, appropriate amount of acid sites is critical for
gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of
ZnO/HZSM-5(160) in our present study.
3.4. Role of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation
CO was detected in the reaction products, suggesting that CO2
was converted into CO during the reaction. It has been reported
that CO2 can react through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and
the Boudouard reaction [3–5,30], as shown below:
CO2 þ H2 ! CO þ H2O
(3)
CO2 þ C ! 2CO
(4)
In order to understand the role of CO2 in the reaction, the variation
of the amount of CO in the reaction product with reaction time on
ZnO/HZSM-5(160) catalyst was tested and given in Fig. 6. The
amount of CO formed in the reaction is always higher than that of
consumed CO2, but lower than twice of CO2 consumed in the
reaction, indicating that CO2 was converted into CO through the
above both reactions during the dehydrogenation process.
To gain further information about the role of CO2 in the
dehydrogenation reaction, the effect of CO2 partial pressure on the
dehydrogenation of propane over ZnO/HZSM-5(160) catalyst was
investigated, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. The propene yield
increases initially with the CO2/C3H8 ratio up to 2, and then
decreases
with
further
increasing
the
CO2/C3H8
ratio.

promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation
reaction can be attributed to the reverse water-gas shift reaction,
which accelerates the formation of the dehydrogenation products
by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O [30]. This can be
proved by the result of H2/CO2 reaction on ZnO/HZSM-5(160), as
shown in Fig. 8. Obviously, the ZnO/HZSM-5(150) catalyst is active
for the reverse water-gas shift reaction. At 600 8C, the CO2
conversion reaches 17.4%.
On the other hand, CO2 has a negative effect on the reaction by
displacing the propane adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Propane is
thought to be dissociatively adsorbed on zinc oxide [27]. So acidic
sites are needed for the adsorption of C3H7
, and basic sites are
needed for the adsorption of H+. Since CO2 is an acidic gas, the
competitive adsorption of CO2 on the basic sites would certainly
reduce the possibility of propane adsorption, leading to a reduction
in propene yield. The negative effect of CO2 on the reaction is not so
evident at a low concentration of CO2, and the propene yield
increases with increasing the CO2/C3H8 ratio. When the CO2
concentration further increases, this negative effect becomes
dominant and the yield of propene begins to decrease. This
accounts for the variation of the propene yield with CO2/C3H8 ratio.
It can also be seen from Fig. 9 that the catalyst stability is greatly
improved after the addition of CO2. The activity of the ZnO/HZSM-
5(160) catalyst drops quickly in the absence of CO2, with an activity
loss of 52.7% after 30 h on stream, much greater than 26.8% in the
presence of CO2. This can also be veriﬁed by the decrease in amount
of coke deposited on the catalyst after reacting in the presence of
CO2 (1.0 wt.%) compared to in the absence of CO2 (2.4 wt.%). This
improvement can be attributed to the suppression of coke
formation from two aspects: elimination of coke by the Boudouard
reaction and acceleration of desorption of the dehydrogenation
product (propene) from the catalyst surface, which was also

supported Ga2O3 catalysts [31].
3.5. Regeneration test
A regeneration treatment of the ZnO/HZSM-5(160) catalyst
after 10 h of reaction at 600 8C in the presence of CO2 was
attempted, and the result is shown in Fig. 10. The propane
conversion on the catalyst decreases from 68.3% to 50.2% after 10 h
on stream. The reaction was interrupted under a N2 stream, and
then O2 was introduced at 550 8C for 3 h to burn off carbon species
deposited on the catalyst. The propane conversion on the
regenerated catalyst is 63.3%, which is lower than the initial
conversion, showing that the original activity of the catalyst could
not be fully restored. Meanwhile, after the second regeneration the
activity of the catalyst is almost fully recovered. The increase in the
activity after regeneration is owing to the removal of carbonaceous
deposit on the catalyst, and the reduction in the activity after the
ﬁrst regeneration could be due to the loss of some temporary active
sites on the fresh catalyst.
4. Conclusions
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the
presence of CO2 was carried out over a series of zinc oxide catalysts
supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratios. The initial activity of
HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts decreases with increasing
the Si/Al ratio, while the stability and the propene selectivity
improve. The ZnO/HZSM-5(160) catalyst exhibits the best perfor-
mance, with a propane conversion of 41.5% and propene yield of
25.8% at steady state. The enhancement of the catalyst stability
with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support originates
from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, as revealed by the
results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption, which
leads to the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking,
oligomerization and aromatization. The promoting effect of CO2 on
the dehydrogenation reaction is observed over ZnO/HZSM-5
catalyst. Results of the inﬂuence of CO2 partial pressure on the
dehydrogenation reaction suggest that there are two roles of CO2: a
positive role by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O through
the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role by
blocking the dissociative adsorption of propane on the catalyst
surface. The catalytic stability is also improved by the addition of
CO2 to the feed gas due to the suppression of coke formation.
