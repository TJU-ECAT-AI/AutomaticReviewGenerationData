Recent advances of pore system construction in
zeolite-catalyzed chemical industry processes
Jing Shi,a Yangdong Wang,a Weimin Yang,a Yi Tang*b and Zaiku Xie*c
The kaleidoscopic applications of zeolite catalysts (zeo-catalysts) in petrochemical processes has been
considered as one of the major accomplishments in recent decades. About twenty types of zeolite have
been industrially applied so far, and their versatile porous architectures have contributed their most
essential features to aﬀect the catalytic eﬃciency. This review depicts the evolution of pore models
in zeolite catalysts accompanied by the increase in industrial and environmental demands. The
indispensable roles of modulating pore models are outlined for zeo-catalysts for the enhancement of
their catalytic performances in various industrial processes. The zeolites and related industrial processes
discussed range from the uni-modal micropore system of zeolite Y (12-ring micropore, 12-R) in fluid
catalytic cracking (FCC), zeolite ZSM-5 (10-R) in xylene isomerization and SAPO-34 (8-R) in olefin
production to the multi-modal micropore system of MCM-22 (10-R and 12-R pocket) in aromatic alkylation
and the hierarchical pores in FCC and catalytic cracking of C4 olefins. The rational construction of pore
models, especially hierarchical features, is highlighted with a careful classification from an industrial
perspective accompanied by a detailed analysis of the theoretical mechanisms.
1. Introduction
The petrochemical industry plays a crucial role in the economic
growth of our modern society. Zeolite catalysts (zeo-catalysts),
being famous for their porous features, have found widespread
applications and have proved to be substantial and paradigmatic
in oil refining and petrochemical processes, such as fluid catalytic
cracking (FCC), aromatics conversion and olefin production.1–6
It is unequivocal that the commercial utilization of zeo-catalytic
technologies has significantly promoted the development of the

petrochemical industry over recent decades, and investigations
on zeo-catalytic materials have become an increasingly hot topic
in academia and industry.7–9 So far, more than two hundred
zeolitic frameworks have been defined and announced by the
International Zeolite Association, and each framework is
described using a three-letter code.10 However, even with natural
zeolites, the emphasis for industrially applied zeo-catalysts in oil
refining and petrochemical process is still placed on zeolites
Y (FAU), ZSM-5 (MFI), mordenite (MOR), beta (BEA), MCM-22
(MWW) and zeolite-like SAPO-34 (CHA) etc.11,12 The most prob-
able reason could be due to their unique pore architectures that
provide a perfect match with the requirement of target reactions,
and their possessing a suitable accessibility of active sites for
guest molecules.13–18
With the increasing demand for sustainability and environ-
mental protection, many engineers and scientists have devoted
themselves to improve the eﬃciency of current industrial
processes or explore new techniques for developing new (petro)-
chemical processes. However, two major challenges still remain
in zeo-catalyzed processes:19–24 (1) the necessity to develop new
processes and catalysts for poor-quality or alternative raw
materials, for example, the production of light olefins from
coal or biomass instead of a conventional oil route has attracted
much attention in the past two decades;25 although an indirect
method from synthesis gas (syngas) to light olefins is now on its
way to being commercialized, a direct process is highly desir-
able. And (2) the demand for maximizing the efficiency and
reducing the energy consumption in currently available tech-
nology. One example in this aspect is a tandem reaction which
integrates different reactions in one-pot.26 Eco-efficiency and
added value to the manufacture process would be significantly
enhanced by avoiding separation, transference and reservation of
intermediates. Therefore, to fit in with the higher requirements
of zeo-catalysts for plentiful feed stocks and novel reactions,
explorations on the construction of proper pore architectures
and their effects, especially those of hierarchical structures, are
particularly attractive.27
Several famous zeo-catalysts have been fabricated and applied
in industrial processes as milestones in history, and have
brought on huge changes in petrochemicals. For example, the
introduction of zeolite Y into the FCC process greatly increased
the catalytic eﬃciency for fuel production, in which the intra-
crystalline supercage of 1.3 nm coupling with the 12-ring (12-R)
micropores at 0.74 nm brought about the concept of the ‘‘porous
eﬀect’’.1,28 Later on, the ZSM-5 zeolite with an intersected 10-R
micropore system with sinusoidal channels of 0.51  0.55 nm
and straight channels of 0.53  0.56 nm gave rise to the well-
known concept of ‘‘shape-selective catalysis’’ maximizing the
benefits in many petrochemical processes.29 In the 1980s,
a SAPO-34 molecular sieve with a narrower 8-R window
(0.38–0.5 nm) was successfully fabricated boasting excellent
performance in the conversion of natural gas and coal to
chemicals via methanol. Recently, small pore zeo-catalysts have
attracted much attention for the requirements of special
‘‘shape-selectivity for small olefins’’.30,31 Since the 1990s, a new
type of zeo-catalyst has been proposed with a multi-modal
micropore system instead of a unimodal one. For instance,

zeolite MWW with two dimensional 10-R sinusoidal channels
and 12-R supercages located between the layers has provided
fantastic, versatile architectures with unexpected performances
in the alkylation of aromatics.32–34
Apart from the innovation of uni- and multi-modal micro-
pores in industrial zeo-catalysts, model constructions of hierar-
chical pores35 have gained increasing interest, and the synthesis
and application of hierarchical zeolites have been reviewed by
many research groups.36–39 The ‘‘hierarchical catalysis’’ concept
was accordingly proposed.40 Thanks to hierarchical pore systems
with multi-functions of micro-meso-macropores, multiple-step
reactions could be carried out in one single zeo-catalyst. As the
product from the previous step could be the reactant of the next
step, energy consumption required for separation, purification
and transformation could be avoided. Many studies and reviews
have indicated that the application of hierarchical zeolites in
various reactions would greatly improve their catalytic perfor-
mances due to the combination of the advantages of both multi-
modal porous systems and the natural properties of zeolite
crystal themselves.41 Being consistent with theoretical and experi-
mental results, some specific cases with hierarchically porous
zeolites used as industrial catalyst were studied by Sinopec.
A micro- and mesoporous structure with the nest-shaped Y
zeolite (called NSY) was successfully synthesized by Sinopec for
a catalytic cracking process through the in situ growth of NaY
zeolite on grains of Kaolin clay.42 With the aid of a special
bi-modal pore system, the NSY catalyst exhibited higher activity
for heavy oil, higher selectivity for gasoline and lower yield for
diesel than commercial systems. Another significant develop-
ment of Sinopec is the full-crystalline zeo-catalyst (zeolite pellets
without binder) with a hierarchical pore structure for the cata-
lytic cracking of C4 olefins prepared via vapor-phase crystal
transformation. Its volume of micropores for catalytic reaction
and that of macropores for molecule diﬀusion increased as
much as 47.8 and 9.4% compared to the conventional zeolite
catalyst, respectively. Propylene selectivity and stability were
dramatically improved for C4 catalytic cracking when using the
full-crystalline ZSM-5 catalyst. An industrial plant for the cata-
lytic cracking of C4 using such a catalyst has been operating in
China since 2009.43
As indicated from the above crucial cases, the evolution of
industrial zeo-catalysis is closely related to the development of
their pore systems. No matter if it is the unimodal pore system
for zeolites Y (12-R), ZSM-5 (10-R) to SAPO-34 (8-R), or the multi-
modal pore system such as those in zeolite MCM-22 (12-R and
10-R), or the micro-mesoporous zeolite NSY and the macro-
meso-microporous zeolite ZSM-5, the pore model construction
generally plays an indispensable role in the advancement of
zeo-catalysts and the innovation of zeo-catalysis. Inspired by the
abundant studies on the pore construction of zeolites and their
great success in broad applications in the petrochemical field
including those of Sinopec, this review seeks to (1) thoroughly
describe the development and advances of zeo-catalysts in the
fundamental industrial processes of FCC, aromatic conversion
and olefin production, and (2) rationally propose a perspective
for the model construction of pore systems in zeo-catalysts from
the industrial viewpoint through the rational classification of
pore topological types and the theoretical analysis of their eﬀects
on the catalytic properties.
2. Overview of the development of
industrially applied zeo-catalysts
2.1
Zeo-catalysts for FCC process
The development of zeo-catalysts is generally summarized in
Fig. 1. The introduction of Y zeolite in FCC is regarded as a
milestone both for the petroleum industry and for zeo-catalysts.
From then, the porous eﬀect on catalytic processes has become
an attractive point for scientists and has gradually been applied
in the design of industrial catalysts. Many studies have been
carried out to innovate the uni-modal micropore system within
the zeolite to match the ever changing requirements of crude
oil quality and production eﬃciency.44–47 For example, Corma
et al.48 reported a new zeolite ITQ-21 (ITO structure, Fig. 2)
which has cavities as spacious as those in zeolite Y but with the
interconnection of six 12-R windows of 0.74 nm rather than the
four in Y zeolite. Its large void space with controlled size and
connectivity was considered beneficial for the diffusion of large
guest molecules and accessibility of the interior active sites.
Catalytic tests showed that ITQ-21 zeolite exhibited an excellent
performance for vacuum gas oil (VGO) cracking with a conver-
sion of 72.5%, compared to a conversion of 68% by USY zeolite.
In order to satisfy the demand for a higher octane number in
gasoline distillation and good yields of light olefins, addition of a
tiny amount of stream-treated ZSM-5 (10-R) in Y (12-R) zeolite has
been widely adopted in the FCC process. The boosted gasoline
octane number and increased yield of propylene can be explained
by the restrained hydrogen transfer and the enhanced selective
cracking of C7–C13 alkanes with straight or short branched
chains in the medium micropore system of ZSM-5 zeolite.49–51
Owing to the success of ZSM-5 zeolite, much effort has been
devoted to the exploration of zeolites with different microporous
topologies as cracking additives (Fig. 3).52 The zeolites MCM-22,53
beta54 and IM-555 have been tried in gasoline cracking. The REY,
USY, mordenite,56 ITQ-7,57 TNU-9 and SSZ-3358 zeolites have been
used for VGO cracking and SAPO-5, MCM-41 and VPI-5 have been
applied in residue cracking. The bi-modal microporosity combi-
nation displayed an obvious synergism in the catalysis. Besides,
it is found from Fig. 3 that more and more zeolites with a larger

micropore size have been employed as additives to improve the
catalytic performance of the FCC process. The mechanical
mixture of two zeolites with different micropore windows, i.e.
the mixing of zeo-catalysts, turned out to be a new direction for
the FCC process with well controlled product selectivity.
With the rapid development of industrial catalytic technol-
ogy, strategies for regulating zeolitic micropore structures have
advanced to chemical methods instead of simple mechanical-
mixing.28 For example, a ZSM-5/Y zeolite composite was synthe-
sized through an in situ crystallization of zeolite NaY gel. The
catalytic results implied that the composite ZSM-5/Y zeo-catalyst
with a peculiar reaction space showed an equivalent light
oil (gasoline and diesel) yield and a higher diesel yield and
diesel/gasoline ratio than the mechanically mixed catalyst due to
the improved intracrystal mass transportation.59 Other multi-
microporous composite zeo-catalysts such as zeolites ZSM-5/
SAPO-11 and MFI/MAZ have also been tested.60–62
Another aspect to improve the catalytic properties of FCC
lies in conquering the diﬀusion limitation of the micropore
system for large molecules in crude oil by manipulating the
accessibility of the inner active sites. The composition of the
feedstock for FCC depends on the source and the previous
treatment of crude oil. Processing increasingly heavier feedstock
is accompanied with increasing mass transfer limitations.28
Although zeolite Y with supercages and 12-R windows performs
well in the cracking reaction, large molecules of the reactant/
intermediate/product still suﬀer from their diﬃculty in diﬀusing
into or out of the channels, which might seriously aﬀect the
reaction eﬃciency and coke formation.63,64 Exploration of the
mesopore system for application in the FCC process has been
made by many groups.65–67 MCM-41, with highly regular arrays
of uniform channels on the mesoscale (Fig. 1), is typical.
Although its activity and selectivity is close to or even higher
than that of USY zeolite,66,67 MCM-41 presents a lower stability
(hydrothermal and mechanical) and a reduced acidity, which
limits its actual application. One strategy to solve this problem
is to construct composites of mesoporous materials and micro-
porous zeolites, such as silicalite-1, L, and USY/Y.68–70 For
example, FAU zeolite was coated with a thin layer (5–20 nm)
of mesoporous MCM-41 (MCM-41/USY) by Kloetstra et al.71 and
was tested in cracking of vacuum gas oil. The experimental
results showed that MCM-41/USY exhibited a higher selectivity
for light cycle oil and gasoline and a lower formation of coking
for the cracking of heavier fractions when compared with

uncoated USY. This contributed to the enlarged pore size
caused by mixing the micropore and mesopore together. Moreover,
the core–shell structured meso-HZSM-5@Al-MCM-41 was also pre-
pared from the sequential desilication (HZ-MT and HZ-ET) and
recrystallization (HZ-MR and HZ-ER) of the parent HZSM-5 and
displayed an excellent catalytic performance in the catalytic crack-
ing of supercritical n-dodecane (500 1C, 4 MPa). By analyzing the
product distribution, it is reasonable to conclude that the pre-
cracking of n-dodecane over Al-MCM-41 shell and the enhanced
diffusion in the meso-HZSM-5 core played an important role in the
increased conversion of dodecane (Fig. 4).72 Therefore, this kind of
multi-modal pore material provides another possibility for design-
ing industrial zeolite catalysts in a chemical sense.

Kaolin and provided the mass transportation path for large
molecular reactants. The mesophase contained the primary
and the secondary structural building units of zeolite Y and
supplied the space for ‘‘pre-cracking’’ of heavy oil molecules
before their entrance into the micropores of Y zeolite. This
advanced gradient pore system significantly facilitated mass
transfer of guest molecules and greatly improved the accessi-
bility to active sites, leading to increased yields of gasoline and
reduced amounts of coke and dry gas. Furthermore, the
asphaltenes (polymeric structures of up to 350 Å) in the heavy
oil would not penetrate into the intracrystalline micropores of
HY zeolites and aﬀect the catalytic cracking in the micropores
of the zeolite.
Hence, the key point in the design of an excellent zeolitic
catalyst for cracking reactions lies in the construction of a
hierarchical structure to optimize the porous gradient for mass
transfer and accelerate the elementary reactions of reactants
with distinct diameters.
In addition to fabricating composites of diﬀerent zeolites
with various porosities, a more promising idea is to integrate
the dual/multi-sizes or structures of pores into one crystal.75
Park et al. demonstrated gas-oil cracking on a mesoporous
ZSM-5 zeo-catalyst for the first time with intracrystal mesopores
of 2.2 and 5.2 nm (MSU-MFI(2.2) and MSU-MFI(5.2)) shown in
Fig. 6a prepared using a soft templating method.76 Notably, the
nitrogen uptake at P/P0 = 0.10–0.90 for the MSU-MFI derivatives
was higher than that of ZSM-5 due to the capillary condensation
of the adsorbate in the small mesopores (Fig. 6b). Jin et al.77
presented a facile method for the fabrication of mesoporous
zeolite Y with bifunctional [(CH3O)3SiC3H6N(CH3)2–C18H37]Cl
as a template. With the introduced intracrystalline mesoporosity
in zeolite Y (Fig. 6e and f), this material showed superior catalytic
performance for heavy oil catalytic cracking (Fig. 6d). A signifi-
cant increase in yields of gasoline and reduction in yields of coke
and dry gas were achieved with mesoporous zeolite Y as com-
pared with the classical microporous zeolite Y.
The development of zeo-catalysts shows that the rational
design and regulation of the pore structure is of significance in
determining the conversion of the raw material and the distribu-
tion of the final products in the FCC process. The matching of the
pore system with the reactants and the target products is very
important. The existence of large pores and spaces would increase
the accessibility of the interior active sites while the small ones
would mainly give rise to spaces for reactions with high activity
and shape-selectivity. The tendency to design catalysts for oil
refining processes will grow, not only in the combination of
various zeolites with diﬀerent pore sizes or pore structures, but
also in the integration of ‘‘hierarchical pores’’ with specially
designed macro-meso-micropores in zeolite crystals.
2.2
Zeo-catalysts for conversion of aromatics
The replacement of liquid acid catalysts by solid ones provides
a solution to the potential environmental problems in indus-
trial processes.78,79 Owing to the perfect geometric matching of
aromatics and micropores,80–83 zeolites have become the most
attractive catalysts for the selective conversion of aromatics,
such as p-xylene production through xylene isomerization and
alkylbenzene preparation via benzene alkylation. So far, industrial
technology for the shape-selective transformation of aromatics has
been viewed as a dominant trend in zeo-catalysts. The construction
of pore systems in zeo-catalysts, especially multi-modal pore struc-
tures, has a great impact on the development of these processes. An
enhanced efficiency of catalysts is achieved via lowering of the
diffusion limitation of the reactant/product but maintaining the
shape-selectivity of the intrinsic microporosity of the zeolite.

aromatics might also occur. Its selectivity is therefore a main
concern for catalytic evaluation. It has long been assumed that the
zeo-catalyzed mechanism of xylene isomerization was largely
governed by the pore structures of the zeolite, i.e. the space
confinement and molecule proximity inside the cavities of the
zeolites could favor bimolecular over unimolecular reactions on
amorphous silica–alumina.85 Besides, for large-pore zeolites
with bigger void spaces or wider pore sizes, the isomerization
would undergo a bimolecular mechanism and require dispro-
portionation and transalkylation involving tri- and tetramethyl-
ated diphenylmethane (3mDPM and 4mDPM) derivatives as
reaction intermediates.84,93 Consequently, the catalytic perfor-
mance will be greatly dependent on the pore architecture of the
zeolite used.
Industrially, the zeolite mordenite has a good performance
due to its wide micropore aperture with 12-R (0.57–0.70 nm),
which is convenient for access of the reactant. However, this
large pore size also provides sufficient space for transalkylation
and causes the non-negligible generation of by-products, such
as toluene and C9-aromatics, while with ZSM-5 zeolite the
transalkylation reaction is greatly inhibited due to its confined
space for the bi-molecuear reaction. However, the smaller pores
of the industrialized zeolite ZSM-5 also promote the undesired
dealkylation process and reduce the amount of the target
aromatic produced.86–90 To solve such a problem, a special bi-
modal micropore EU-1 zeolite, with medium 10-R pores (similar
to ZSM-5) and large 12-R side pockets, was studied and indus-
trialized for the isomerization of xylene.91 Its unique bimodal
micropore structure could not only offer a shape-selective
reaction space for the main isomerization reaction but also
promote the diffusion of product molecules and thereby inhibit
the dealkylation, which renders it with a possibility of both high
conversion and high selectivity under milder conditions. Indus-
trialized plants based on these zeo-catalysts are in operation all
over the world, as listed in Table 1 and Fig. 7.
Additionally, many studies have been conducted for the
development of this process.92 Hong et al.93 compared the
catalytic properties of up to 16 zeolites with diﬀerent frame-
work topologies for this aromatic transformation. These zeo-
lites can be generally classified into two types: (1) zeolites with a
uni-micropore system containing 12-R or 10-R channels such as
mordenite, beta, Y, H-ZSM-5, H-IM-5, H-ITQ-2, H-ZSM-22 and
H-ZSM-23 and (2) zeolites with a bi-micropore system with 12-R
plus 10-R (e.g. H-MCM-22, H-TNU-9, H-NU-87 and H-EU-1) and
10-R plus 8-R channels (e.g. H-ZSM-57, H-TNU-10, H-SUZ-4, and
H-ferrierite). It was found that for uni-micropore systems, the
zeolites with a medium size gave a notably higher conversion
and higher yield than any of those with a large pore size, such as
H-Y, H-beta, and H-mordenite via the bimolecular mechanism. For
the bi-micropore system, the shortest dimensions (4.0 or 4.1 Å) of
the 10-ring portals in H-MCM-22 imparted a smaller intracrystal-
line diﬀusivity of m-xylene and presented a fairly low conversion
and product yield. H-TNU-10 (STI) and H-ZSM-57 (MFS) with
intersecting 10- plus 8-ring channels showed slightly lower and
higher conversions at 523 K than HZSM-5, respectively, but gave
rise to considerably higher p-xylene/o-xylene ratios than H-ZSM-5.
As for H-TNU-9 (TUN) and H-NU-87 with 10-ring and 12-ring
pockets, a higher m-xylene conversion was observed, suggesting
their promising potential as isomerization catalysts (Fig. 8).
2.2.2
Zeo-catalysts for alkylation of benzene and ethylene. As
an important intermediate in styrene production, ethylbenzene
(EB) is highly required in the petrochemical industry for use in
making polystyrene.94 Industrially, EB is mainly fabricated
through two methods, i.e., alkylation of benzene with ethylene
in the gaseous phase or liquid phase. Some commercial pro-
cesses are listed in Table 2.
2.2.2.1 Gas phase. Mobil and Badger developed an indus-
trialized alkylation technology for EB fabrication in the vapor
phase on the basis of the ZSM-5 catalyst.95,96 Thanks to the
proper pore size of this zeolite, the eﬃciencies for EB diﬀusion
and alkyl transfer were drastically increased while the production
of polyethylbenzene was greatly suppressed.97 However, the pure
zeolite ZSM-5 catalyst suﬀered from severe disadvantages. For
example, the high benzene to ethylene molar ratio (B/E of about
8–16) required more energy for the separation of EB. The high
level of byproducts, the low selectivity toward EB and the rapid
deactivation of the catalyst required severe operating conditions
and frequent regeneration.98 Thereafter, improvement of this
zeo-catalyst was highly desired for this process.
An intergrown structure of ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 zeolites with
special reaction space of multi-micropores was synthesized

by Mobil.99,100 The skeletal drawing of its periodic framework is
shown in Fig. 9A. Xu et al.101,102 successfully synthesized a
series of ZSM-5/ZSM-11 co-crystalline zeolites with various
compositions and morphologies via an organic template-free
hydrothermal route (Fig. 9B and C) and studied their alkylation
kinetics and coking behaviors. It was found that this mechani-
cally bi-micropore structure favored the diﬀusion of large inter-
mediates and the selective formation of ethylbenzene, but
inhibited the generation of multinuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
for coke formation. Based on research of the reaction behavior
with time, temperature, reactants and products during the
alkylation process, the coking rate followed the order of ethyl-
benzene 4 ethylene 4 propylene 4 benzene for single com-
ponents, and benzene–ethylene 4 benzene–propylene for
bi-components. Thanks to the decreased coke deposition and
prolonged stability of the catalyst, ZSM-5/ZSM-11 intergrown
zeolite was successfully industrialized for ethylbenzene pre-
paration by DICP in China.103,104
Since the similar boiling points of xylene and ethylbenzene
often lead to a serious problem in the separation process,

the co-existence of xylene as a by-product, even in trace amounts,
is fatal in the alkylation process of EB fabrication.105,106 It is
found that the formation of xylene is generally ascribed to the
cracking and consequent transalkylation of EB (Fig. 10). There-
fore, to inhibit its generation, the diﬀusion properties of the
zeo-catalyst needs to be improved. On the one hand, zeolites
with bi-micropores in one crystal, such as NU-87 (NES) zeolite
with 10-R channels intersected by perpendicular 12-R cavities,107–109
may provide an interesting candidate for this catalysis. Its large
12-R cavities provide the spaces for the diffusion and reaction
of large molecules, while its unique bi-micropore system would
allow the products to diffuse at different rates. On the other
hand, hierarchical pore zeolites with intra- or inter-crystalline
mesoporosity interconnecting with the inherent microporosity

would improve the additional mass transportability of guest
species through the micropore-to-mesopore and mesopore-to-
mesopore networks.110 MCM-36 zeolite, derived from MCM-22(P)
with silica species pillared between the layers, possessed a unique
‘‘pseudo-hierarchical porous’’ structure with micro- and meso-
pores. Such a meso/microporous system had abundant exposed
acid sites and promoted the diffusion of products in the porous
networks, which consequently reduced/inhibited the formation
of xylene.111 Furthermore, studies on the synthesis of meso-
porous ZSM-5 zeolite with meso- and micro-pores both existing
in a crystal have also been reported recently.112 The catalytic
properties of this bi-modal pore in the alkylation of benzene
with ethylene are shown in Fig. 11A and B. The authors
attributed the improved catalytic activity and the high selectivity
of ethylbenzene to the rapid diffusion of desired products in the
interconnected mesoporous networks, which shortened the path
length of the micropores within each individual zeolite crystal.
Such connection of the hierarchical pore network could also
be confirmed using laser-hyperpolarized 129Xe NMR (HP 129Xe
NMR)113 on the synthesized mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolite using
tetrapropylammonium hydroxide with starch as the co-template
(Fig. 11C and D). The results of the two-dimensional exchange

spectroscopy (EXSY) indicate that even at very low temperature,
Xe atoms still undergo much faster exchange between meso-
pores and micropores in meso-ZSM-5 than conventional ZSM-5.
2.2.2.2 Liquid phase. The adoption of Y zeolite as a catalyst
for benzene alkylation in the liquid phase was explored by UOP/
Lummus/Unocal.114 Afterwards, zeolite beta with high defects
was gradually applied in this process for its higher selectivity of
EB. The three-dimensional 12-R interconnected chiral micro-
pore network with a pore size relatively smaller than that of Y
zeolite greatly matched the reaction requirements and eﬃ-
ciently prevented the formation of bulky by-products. However,
the diﬀusion limit in these uni-micropores was still consider-
able at low temperature in the liquid phase, and in this case,
bulky by-products of alkylbenzene would be generated from
further alkylation of benzene and led to a high B/E ratio in the
raw material in the industrial process.115,116
In the 1990s, bi-modal zeolite MCM-22 was gradually developed
for its application in the liquid phase alkylation of benzene with a
low ratio of B/E, such as the famous EBMax process developed by
Mobil.117 This novel zeolite possesses a unique 10-R pore and 12-R
half-supercage as well as a lamellar structure.118–120 On the one
hand, its 10-R pore with a certain degree of shape-selectivity could
promote the formation of EB in alkylation more than that in the
12-R pore of zeolite beta. On the other hand, its layered structure
and large-sized supercage would supply enough space for the
diffusion of bulky products which could efficiently decrease coke
formation to improve the stability of the catalyst. In the litera-
ture,121 the role of the pore system in the valued MCM-49 system,
possessing nearly the same framework topology as calcinated
MCM-22 (only the average unit cell c-parameter is 0.02 nm longer
in MCM-49),33 was studied through the coking and poisoning of
the distinct pores or cages. It was found that the main reaction
occurred in the pockets at the surface while coke deposition and
oligomerization of ethylene were more favorably produced in the
large space of the supercages and 10-R pores. Shu et al.122–124
obtained MCM-49 zeolite via the transformation from NaA (LTA)
zeolite in the synergism of hexamethyleneimine (HMI), NaOH,
and SiO2 (Fig. 12A). The easy accessibility of active sites provided
simultaneous improvement in ethylene conversion and EB selec-
tivity. Afterwards, this group further investigated the size control
and morphology control of the obtained MCM-49 (Fig. 12B and C).
By changing the original size of the parent FAU zeolites via
topology reconstruction (Fig. 12B), size controlled synthesis of
MCM-49 zeolites was achieved. This demonstrated that the
smaller the MCM-49, the better the accessibility to the active
centers for benzene and the higher the geometrical regularity of
the zeolite, which ensured excellent catalytic performance in the
liquid-phase alkylation of benzene with ethylene. For morphol-
ogy tailoring, they post-treated the as-synthesized MCM-49 with
tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) and obtained different
samples from rose-like shapes to small irregular sheets packed
in disorder (Fig. 12C). These materials with increased surface
areas and pore volumes would offer more opportunities for
reactants to access the active centers to increase ethylene con-
version without loss of EB selectivity.
2.2.3
Zeolites for cumene synthesis. The development
and catalytic ability of pore systems with diﬀerent zeolites in
cumene synthesis are listed in Table 3. In the alkylation of
benzene with propylene, byproducts like n-propylbenzene would
be favored instead of cumene (IPB) when ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst is
used (Fig. 13),106 and a higher reaction temperature is needed
to circumvent the diﬀusion limitation in the 10-R pores of
ZSM-5.125,126 Therefore, the main trend in industrial processes
was to use zeolites X, Y or mordenite with large uni-micropore
sizes for cumene synthesis.127 The catalytic properties of zeo-
lites beta, ZSM-12, ERB-1, Y and mordenite were compared for
cumene synthesis via experimental and computational methods
(Fig. 14).126,128 Among these zeolites, beta zeolite appeared to be
the most eﬃcient catalyst producing the smallest amount of
propylene oligomers and n-propylbenzene on account of the
diﬀerences in the diﬀusion barriers and the binding energy in
the micropores. Furthermore, it exhibited high cumene selectivity
as well as catalytic activity due to the three-dimensional network
with suﬃcient pore space and appropriate acid strength. Con-
sequently, this new alkylation catalyst for cumene was studied by
UOP and the so-called Q-Max process was successfully developed
in the early 1990s.129 Concluding from the applied patents, the
catalyst named MgAPSO-31 in such a process was beta zeolite.
The eﬃcacy of the uni-micropore system in zeolite beta and
the bi-micropore system in the MCM-22 catalyst was tested using
a real feed under experimental conditions.130 Zeolite MCM-22
produced a lower yield of unknown oligomer and deactivated
more slowly than zeolite beta. The diﬀusion of benzene and
cumene in either of the two pore systems of zeolite MCM-22 was
hampered by a high energy barrier, while for beta zeolite, both
benzene and cumene could diﬀuse without great diﬃculty due
to the lower steric hindrance. Corma et al.33 treated a sample of
zeolite MCM-22 with 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine, which was too
large to diﬀuse through 10-R windows and channels, to passivate
the external surface of MCM-22 without poisoning the internal
acid sites of this zeolite.
It was found that the oligomer produced inside the 10-R
cavities of MWW zeolite would not aﬀect the alkylation of
benzene with propylene which mainly occurred in the 12-R cups
or the pore mouths on the external surface. Moreover, the improve-
ment of diﬀusion rate in the 12-R pores would benefit the genera-
tion of cumene with the advantage of dynamic diﬀusion, and
remarkably decrease the production of n-propylbenzene.34 How-
ever, due to the unavoidable condensation of interlamellar Si–OH
in calcination, the open half-supercage of MWW zeolite usually
converted into the closed cage, leading to the obvious diminishing
of accessible acid sites.131 Sinopec recently developed a new
technology for the preparation of lamellar MWW zeolite using
an organosilicone hybrid method.132 Grafting organosilicones
in situ on the layer could efficiently inhibit the condensation of
Si–OH groups and hence generate a long-range disordered
lamellar structure. Such an open-pore structured zeolite with
an organosilicone hybrid lamellar was named SRZ-21 by Sinopec
and commercialized in 2010, and exhibited good catalytic per-
formance for the industrial alkylation process of cumene with a
low benzene/propylene (B/P) ratio.

Recently, a new kind of zeolite with a bi-micropore system,
zeolite ITQ-39, was prepared. It possessed an outstanding pore
system with interconnected large pores of 12-R and medium
pores of 10-R and therefore achieved an eﬀective pore diameter
between ZSM-5 and beta zeolites.133,134 In the alkylation
of benzene with propylene, such a bi-modal 12-R plus 10-R
pore network exhibited improved diﬀusion properties and an
increased selectivity of the target product (Fig. 15A–D). Besides,
ITQ-24, another new bi-micropore zeolite, containing two sets
of 12-R channels and one 10-R channel system that intersected
perpendicularly to both 12-R channel systems has been found
to be catalytically active and selective for the alkylation of

pores which would slow down the coking rate on the catalyst.137
It is reasonable to conclude that pore model construction from
uni-micropore to bi-micropore or even pseudo-hierarchical pores
could find a foothold to improve industrial alkylation processes
and would further direct the development of zeo-catalysis.

Zeo-catalysts for olefin production
Light olefins such as ethylene and propylene were traditionally
produced via thermal cracking of hydrocarbons at high
temperature.138 After 2000, the zeo-catalysts SAPO-34 and zeo-
lite ZSM-5 were demonstrated to be of use for the conversion of
methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and the cracking of C4/C5 olefins,
respectively and the related techniques were successfully com-
mercialized.139,140 These two processes mainly involved the
transformation of intermediates in the ‘‘hydrocarbon pool’’ which
could be tuned and regulated by means of precisely controlling
the pore system in the zeolite catalyst.

including light olefins could be produced from methanol when
catalyzed by H-ZSM-5, which was the so-called methanol-to-
hydrocarbons (MTH) conversion.141 This process has emerged as
an attractive alternative to the re-emergence of the coal chemical
industry.142–146 The raw material methanol can be converted to
diverse products through methanol-to-olefin (MTO), methanol-
to-propylene (MTP) and methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) conver-
sions, when catalyzed by different zeolites with specific pore
structures (Fig. 16).147
The reaction mechanism of MTO conversion is very compli-
cated due to the complex product distribution (olefins, alkanes,
and aromatics). During the past four decades, over 20 diﬀerent
reaction mechanisms were proposed, and many experimental
and theoretical works have been dedicated to understand the
MTO reaction mechanism.148,149,152,153 More details can be found
in recent reviews.152,153 Herein, the viewpoints on the MTO
reaction mechanisms are concisely summarized. A direct
coupling mechanism, displayed in Fig. 17A, involving C1 species
like carbenium, carbene, and oxonium-ylide, were proved impos-
sible due to the higher energy barriers.150–152 Later, an indirect
reaction mechanism, known as a hydrocarbon pool mechanism,
see Fig. 17B, has gained wide acceptance.153 In this mechanism,
certain organic reaction centers, called hydrocarbon pool spe-
cies, act as co-catalysts at which methanol reacts to form alkyl
chains, and then these alkyl chains eliminate to produce light
olefins as products. Both polymethylbenzenes and olefins them-
selves were once proposed as the primary hydrocarbon pool
species in the MTO conversion. A dual-cycle concept was then
proposed according to the features of the hydrocarbon pool.154
In H-ZSM-5, Svelle et al.145 proposed that ethylene was exclu-
sively produced from an aromatic-based cycle, while propylene
and higher olefins were produced from an olefin-based cycle. In
the aromatic-based cycle, the alkyl side chain could be formed by
side chain or paring reaction routes. It was theoretically found
that it was a side chain cycle rather than a paring route which
played an important role in this cycle in H-SAPO-34. Polymethyl-
benzenium cations and species with exocyclic double bonds
were believed to be important intermediates in the side chain
aromatic-based cycle. In the olefin-based cycle (see Fig. 17C),
methanol reacted with olefins to form higher carbenium
cations and then the latter cracked into lighter olefins. In this
proposed olefin-based cycle, all the observed products includ-
ing olefins, alkanes, and aromatics could be formulated. We
theoretically indicated that the distribution of cracking pre-
cursors (carbenium cations, alkoxides, and higher olefins)
affected the product distribution.
A large number of zeolites or aluminosilicate zeotypes either
with uni-micropores like ZSM-48, ZSM-12, ZSM-22 or those with
bi-micropores like SAPO-46 and EU-1, etc. have been extensively
explored for MTO conversion (Table 4).155–157 Song et al.157
reported that for one-dimensional (1D) zeolite catalysts with
similar pore structures, it is a difference of 0.3 Å in pore size
(e.g., 5.6  6.0 Å for H-ZSM-12 and 4.6  5.7 Å for H-ZSM-22)
that leads to an activity difference for the MTO process. The
sizes of the main hydrocarbon pool intermediates for the MTO
process are suggested to be between 5.7 and 6.0 Å. Olsbye and
Svelle et al.155 systematically compared the distribution of
products in 1D 10-R zeolites, such as ZSM-22, ZSM-23, ZSM-48
and EU-1. Although the ZSM-22 and ZSM-23 zeolites both
possess 1D channel structures of 10-R, the activity and product
distributions are obviously different, as shown in Fig. 18A. In
another set of 10-R zeolites with different volumes at channel
intersections (TNU-9, IM-5, ZSM-11, and ZSM-5, Fig. 18C), Olsbye
et al.158 found that the effluent products were strikingly similar
with different life-time durations. The presence of larger cavities
in TNU-9 and IM-5 resulted in the formation of polyaromatics
and fast deactivation compared to ZSM-5 and ZSM-11. By care-
fully selecting SAPO molecular sieves with different cavity sizes
but having identical 8-R pore openings, Liu et al.159 compared
the confinement effects on the intermediates in olefin genera-
tion. Verified using isotopic tracing methods and theoretical
calculations based on the observation of two types of carbenium
intermediates, polyMB+ and polyMCP+, the cavity size controlled
the intermediate type and resulted in different MTO activity and
product selectivity. Dai et al.160 also compared different frame-
works of SAPO-11 (10-R, 4  6.5 Å), SAPO-46 (12-R, 7  7 Å) and
SAPO-41 (10-R, 4.3  7.0 Å) possessing 2D and 3D pore archi-
tectures for MTO. The results in Fig. 18B indicated that the
oversized pore windows/cages of SAPO-46 permitted the diffu-
sion of high-carbon branched hydrocarbons (4C4) and alkyl-
benzenes, and exhibited a quite low catalytic activity. By slightly
increasing the pore size as in SAPO-11 and SAPO-41, initial
methanol conversion could be enhanced effectively. Although
the selectivity to olefins in SAPO-41 was not as high as that in
SAPO-34, the lifetime of the former was superior to SAPO-11 and
SAPO-34 due to its moderate pore size and sufficient Brønsted
acid sites. These features facilitated the diffusion of inter-
mediates from re-methylation on the one hand, and prevented
deactivation of the zeo-catalyst on the other hand. Davis et al.16
compared the catalytic performance of zeolites containing
8-R pores with different cavity geometries (SSZ-13, SSZ-16, and
SSZ-17). They observed that the selectivity to ethylene decreased
as the cage size increased, and the propylene selectivity for
SSZ-13 exceeded those of either SSZ-16 or SSZ-17. Liu et al.161

also compared zeolites with 8-R pores (H-SAPO-18, H-SAPO-34,
and H-SAPO-35). They found that the primary products in
H-SAPO-34 and H-SAPO-18 were propylene and butylene, while
the primary products in H-SAPO-35 were ethylene and propylene,
and in particular ethylene was predominantly produced. The
formed coke species was found to greatly depend on the reaction
temperature and cage size. Employing a classical molecular
dynamics method, we found that the diffusion abilities of
ethylene and propylene varied with the zeolite framework
topology.162 The diffusion of propylene in CHA with 8-R pores
was severely restricted since the diffusion barrier was more
than 20 kJ mol1, and the ratio of the self-diffusion coefficient
of ethylene/propylene was as high as 18 kJ mol1. By using
12C-/13C-methanol switching technology, Liu et al. comparatively
studied MTO conversion over ZSM-5, ZSM-22 and SAPO-34.163

was found to be hindered in TON-structured ZSM-22 with a one
dimensional channel structure without intersections. Since it
could provide a large space at 5.7  4.6 Å2, a low selectivity was
observed with the mechanism through the methylation and
cracking steps. However zeolite ZSM-5, which had a dual inter-
connected channel structure, provided suitable space for the
evolution of hydrocarbon pool species and produced a relatively
high selectivity for ethylene and propylene. In contrast, due to
the smaller pore size, SAPO-34 was found to produce a lower
amount of aromatics than ZSM-5 and presented the highest
selectivity for light olefins. Additionally, this process was also
tested for USM-12 (ERI), H-SSZ-13 (CHA), H-SAPO-34 (CHA) and
H-SAPO-17 (ERI) by Lee et al.164 It was demonstrated that the
intermediate of phenanthrene rather than methylphenanthrenes
could be detected in the deactivated zeolite with CHA topology.
However in the ERI-type architecture, the trend was opposite.
Both methylphenanthrenes and methylanthracenes were detect-
able in the products. It is well known that methylanthracenes are
slightly narrower but longer than methylphenanthrenes which
matched perfectly with the ERI cage that was slightly narrower
but had a longer space than the CHA cage. This suggests that in
the small-pore cage-based material, the shapes and sizes of
cavities/windows may act as reverse templates for the formation
of the accumulated aromatics and finally govern the MTO
catalytic activity, selectivity and deactivation. Therefore, fine
tuning of the pore structure in zeolites is a very critical factor
for the catalytic performance in MTO conversion.
In addition to the precise control of the uni-micropore and
bi-mircopore zeolites either through the morphology or the
particle size,165,166 the introduction of hierarchical-pores into a
microporous zeolite framework can not only improve the
accessibility of the active sites for molecules of a special size,
but also influence the shape selectivity to reactants/intermediates/
products of zeolitic pore structures. Several works have reported
the preparation of hierarchical zeolites through (1) a bottom-up
method with templates followed by calcination or (2) a top-down
strategy with extraction of one framework element from the
zeolite. The referred-to templates of mesoporous zeolites for
the MTO process mainly include carbon nanomaterials and
nanotubes,167 P123168,169 and N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantan-
ammonium hydroxide (TMAdOH).170 Extraction was mainly
performed using an acid or basic treatment like NaOH171 and
fluoride ions.172 Furthermore, SAPO-34/Kaolin microspheres
(4-SCKMs) were obtained under hydrothermal conditions using
TEAOH as a template after pre-treating the Kaolin with 4 wt%
NaOH solution.173 Its catalytic activity could be preserved for
more than 960 min because of the existence of mesopores (pore
size 17.4 nm) which improved the diﬀusion of larger molecules
and decreased the formation of coking.

Zeo-catalysts for catalytic cracking of C4 olefins. In
recent years, the catalytic cracking of C4 olefins has been proved
to be important in boosting the demand of light olefins and
there has been an increasing interest in the catalytic cracking of
butene to produce ethylene and propylene. The representative
technologies for the catalytic cracking of C4 olefins are the MOI
technology from Mobil, the Superflex technology from ARCO
and the Propylur technology from Lurgi. These processes are
mainly catalyzed by the acidic ZSM-5 zeolite with a medium

pore size, which is larger than the diameter of the C4-olefin
(0.51 nm) and smaller than the size of the coke precursors.174
The catalytic cracking of C4 olefins into propylene was com-
pared on MOR (12-R pore), ZSM-5 (10-R pore) and SAPO-34
(8-R pore) in our laboratory to explore the relationship between
pore structures and catalytic performance. Plots of conversion
and propylene yield with time on stream (TOS) in various
zeolites are shown in Fig. 19E and F.175 The ZSM-5 and
mordenite zeolites exhibited higher initial conversions than
SAPO-34 (Fig. 19E). The yield of target propylene on ZSM-5 was
above 20% (Fig. 19F), but that of mordenite and SAPO-34 was
very low. Besides, ZSM-5 zeolite possessed a relatively longer
lifetime than mordenite and SAPO-34 zeolites. In terms of pore-
structure, the mordenite zeolite consisted of a 1D 12-R pore

system which positively facilitated the diﬀusion of C4 olefins
and products but negatively brought the possibility of blockage
from coking. As a result, it exhibited a poor stability. The small
size of the 8-R pores in SAPO-34 would limit the diﬀusion of
large reactants and products despite its 3D interconnected
framework. It gave rise to a low catalytic activity. Moreover,
the occurrence of most side-reactions at the external surface
would lead to its low selectivity.
The diﬀerence in the deactivation pathways of HZSM-5
zeolite and SAPO-34 for the transformation of ethylene or
1-butene to propylene was reported176 in the literature. In the
CHA structure of SAPO-34 with cavities in the intersections, the
diﬀusion of alkylated aromatics towards the outside was inhibited
and the active acid sites were blocked, whereas, in the MFI
structure of HZSM-5 with a high connectivity and without cavities,
diﬀusion of the aromatics was favored and a longer lifetime was
presented. The pore structure plays an important role in regulat-
ing the final distribution of the products. The interconnection
and appropriate size of the ZSM-5 channels make it an optimal
candidate for C4 catalytic cracking with high anti-coking ability
and stability. Also, many other zeolites such as ZSM-23,177
ZSM-48,178 MCM-22179 have been tried in this process but have
poorer catalytic performance than ZSM-5 (Fig. 19A–D).
Since the products have diﬃculty diﬀusing in the micro-
porous structure of ZSM-5, its pore openings are easily blocked
by the products and coke is formed. To further improve the
diﬀusion ability and stability of ZSM-5, a full crystalline zeolite
catalyst with a hierarchical pore structure was prepared using a
crystal transformation at the vapor phase. The amorphous
binder was transformed into a zeolite structure and meso-
porous templates were introduced to build hierarchical pores.
Compared to a conventional zeolite catalyst, its volume of micro-
pores for the reaction and that of the macropores for diﬀusion
were increased by 47.8 and 9.4%, respectively. Propylene selecti-
vity and stability for C4 catalytic cracking were dramatically
improved using the full crystalline ZSM-5 catalyst. An industrial
plant for the catalytic cracking of C4 using such a catalyst has
been in operation in China since 2009.43,180,181 Additionally, the
combination of micro- and meso-pores is beneficial to improving
the activity and the diﬀusion of the products. Recently, meso-
porous ZSM-5 with micro- and meso-pores integrated in one
crystal was reported via an alkali-treatment.182 The introduction
of mesopores into parent ZSM-5 led to a high yield of ethylene
plus propylene.
3. Insight into the porosity influence in
industrially applied zeolitic catalysis
Based on the development of industrial processes for the FCC
process, aromatic conversions and olefin production, it is obvious
that the pore architecture plays a crucial role in zeo-catalysis
processes. Facing the various requirements of industrial pro-
cesses, rational construction of the pore model is critically
essential. Besides, the pore structure of the zeolite would have
a substantial and direct eﬀect on the utilization eﬃciency of the
zeo-catalyst. The Thiele modulus j and the eﬀectiveness factor
Z are classically used to describe the catalyst utilization degree
in reaction engineering as shown in Fig. 20.35,183 As the
intrinsic reaction rate (kv) would not change for a given reaction
at a given temperature, the eﬀectiveness factor Z could increase
with an increment of the diﬀusivity Deﬀby reducing the typical
particle size or pore length (L). These parameters definitely
depend on the accessibility of the active sites, and the confine-
ment and connectivity of the pores at various levels, which
could be precisely modulated by the construction of the pore
model in the zeolite.
On the basis of the eﬀects of the pores on the product
selectivity and utilization eﬃciency of the zeo-catalyst, we
defined three types of zeolites according to their pore models
(Fig. 21) which were believed to be the main trends for developing
and designing further industrial zeo-catalysts.
 Type I: zeolites with one modal micropore (uni-micropore).
This refers to the zeolites with one set of micropore systems
such as Y for the FCC process, ZSM-5 for aromatic conversion
and SAPO-34 for MTO reactions.
 Type II: zeolites with multi-modal microporosity (multi-
micropores). This includes zeolites with two or more models of
micropores. This type of zeolite could be further classified into
three sub-types: (1) Type II-1 represents a mechanical mixture
of two or more kinds of zeolites with diﬀerent microporosities,
such as Y zeolite mixing with ZSM-5 as additives in the FCC

process (Y + ZSM-5), (2) Type II-2 includes composites of
diﬀerent zeolites integrated via various chemical interactions,
such as ZSM-5/Y in FCC and ZSM-5/ZSM-11 in ethylbenzene
synthesis, and (3) Type II-3 refers to a single zeolite framework
containing two or more types of micropores, such as zeolite EU-1
for p-xylene synthesis and MCM-22 for the cumene process.
 Type III: zeolites with hierarchical nanostructures of micro-
meso-macropore systems. This type further includes two subtypes:
(1) Type III-1 includes microporous zeolite composites with macro-
or mesopores in the substrate or the component around, such as
MY/Kaolin for FCC and SCKMs for MTO, and (2) Type III-2 refers
to zeolites with meso- or macropores extending inside the crystal,
such as meso-ZSM-5 for ethylbenzene fabrication.
3.1
Zeolites with one-modal micropore systems (Type I)
By applying high-throughput technology and computerized
strategies, more and more zeolites with novel frameworks are
being successfully predicted and synthesized to enrich the zeo-
bank.184 However, only a few types of zeolite have been paid
attention to for practical applications.185,186 Firstly, zeolites for
industrial applications mainly possess 8-, 10- and 12-R pores
with diameters between 4 and 7.5 Å which match perfectly with
the sizes of the hydrocarbons in oil-refining and petrochemical
processes, as shown in Fig. 22.187 If the pore size is too narrow,
such as the SOD zeolite with a pore diameter of only 2.8 Å (6-R),
the reactant would be excluded from entering into the inside
space, and therefore the catalytic process is hindered. Secondly,
for zeolites with proper micropore dimensions that enable the
desired reactants and products to get through, their particular
reaction pathway might be further limited by the pore or cave
structures with diﬀerent sizes and confined spaces.188,189
In the catalytic cracking reaction involving the conversion of
large reactants to smaller products, the FAU zeolite with 12-R
pores was preferred due to its pore size and supercage large

(A) The equation of the Thiele modulus j (1), its relationship with the eﬀectiveness factor Z (2), and the concentration profiles across a zeolite
crystal (slab geometry) (3). (B) A low Thiele modulus leads to full catalyst utilization (j  0, Z  1) while a high Thiele modulus results in a poorly utilized
catalyst (j  N, Z  1/N). Full utilization of the catalyst particle (Z  1) represents a situation where the observed reaction rate equals the intrinsic reaction
rate due to operation in a chemical regime, i.e. free of any diﬀusion constraints. They were derived assuming steady-state diﬀusion and reaction, a slab
model, a first-order irreversible reaction, and isothermal conditions. (C) The reactant concentration inside the particle, which is lower than the bulk
concentration Cs if diﬀusion limitation occurs. The concentration across a zeolite crystal is extinguished (c/cs = 0) near the surface at j = 10, while being
practically uniform and very similar to the surface concentration (C/Cs = 1) at j = 0.1. (D) A schematic illustration of the concentration profile of a reactant
through (1) a conventional zeolite crystal when diﬀusion is limiting the zeolite catalyst performance. The concentration in the gas-phase is constant at a
given position in the catalytic reactor under steady state conditions. (2) In a mesoporous zeolite crystal, the diﬀusion is suﬃciently fast to maintain the
reactant concentration at the same level inside and outside the crystal during reaction. For catalytic reactions involving reactants and products with
relatively slow diﬀusion rates, it is not possible to fully utilize the entire zeolite crystal for catalysis (3) unless intracrystalline mesopores are introduced (4).

enough for the adsorption and conversion of alkane molecules.
With the increasing demand for a higher octane number of
gasoline distillation and yields of light olefins, ZSM-5 with 10-R
micropores was added to its medium micropore system for the
selective cracking and isomerization of C7–C13 alkanes with
straight or short branched chains. As reported for the zeo-catalyzed
conversion of n-decane, the pore structure of the zeolite played
an important role in deciding the free energy of formation of
the key intermediates (calculated from Configurational-Bias
Monte Carlo) and left its signature on the final product distribu-
tion. In MEL zeolite with a relatively wide pore size, n-decane will
isomerize to 2,4-dimethyl octane which snugly fits in the large
pore intersections, while in MFI zeolite with zigzag channels,
n-decane prefers to form 4,4-dimethyl octane instead and exhi-
bits an opposite trend in experimental catalytic runs. According
to previous studies,190–192 the adsorption enthalpy and activation
energy of the same n-alkane molecule varied as a function of the
mean pore diameter of the zeolites with the frameworks MFI,
MOR, FAU, RHO, LTA and FER. The larger the pore size was, the
lower the heat of adsorption was. In the case of a small pore
zeolite such as RHO and LTA, the n-alkane preferred to stay in a
localized, highly coiled state in the maximum a-cages, which in
turn influenced the diffusion and the location of the molecules
in the zeolites.

As for aromatic conversions with reactants and products
with slightly diﬀerent sized scales, the eﬀect of geometrically
matching the micropores and guest molecules on the product
distribution (shape selectivity) is distinctly observed. For xylene
isomerization, ZSM-5, with its micropore architecture perfectly
matching the dimensions of p-xylene, plays an important role
in achieving its unique shape selectivity. In the synthesis of
ethylbenzene and cumene, ZSM-5 zeolite with MFI structure
was suitable for the alkylation of benzene and ethylene but not
appropriate for the larger propylene. And for reactions with a
diﬀerent pathway, such as the disproportionation of ethyl-
benzene, it was reported that the reaction proceeded through a
bimolecular mechanism in the FAU zeolite with a large supercage
connected by 12-R windows, while it was conducted through a
single molecular mechanism in ZSM-5 zeolite with a smaller
pore size of 10-R channels.193
In the MTH process with the conversion of small reactants to
larger molecular products, the geometrical matching eﬀect of the
micropores significantly aﬀects the chemistry involving the aro-
matic intermediates.147 Larger and more substituted aromatic
transition states could be easily generated because of their lower
reaction rates than those of the smaller analogues within zeolite
pores with the steric eﬀect. Although the relationship between
the product distribution and the zeolite topology has been
revealed in some specific cases, the kinetic behavior, reaction
mechanism as well as the interaction of each reaction in the
MTH hydrocarbon pool are still unclear. The interplay between
the zeolite topology and the catalytic performance or kinetic
process is pivotal for the final product distribution in MTH
processes, which we believe is dependent on the pore size and
the confined space supplied by the diverse pore features of
the zeolite.
The evolution of pore size in commercial zeolite catalysts
has changed from 12-R of FAU (pore size of 7 to 8 Å) to 10-R of
MFI (pore size of 5 to 6 Å), and then to 8-R of CHA (pore size of
4 Å) to meet the diﬀerent requirements of FCC, aromatic
conversion and olefin production, respectively. The micropore
opening size and the confined spaces in a zeo-catalytic process
would not only determine whether the industrial process works
or not but also decides the kinetics when it works. Thus, to
satisfy the changeable requirements of diﬀerent industrial pro-
cesses, an appropriate micropore architecture highly adaptable
with the target product and the reaction pathway is strongly
desired and will become one of the main trends in designing
industrial zeo-catalysts.

(Type II-1) is a way of designing zeo-catalysts with multi-modal
micropores. The intergrowth of zeolites via co- or mixed-
crystallization of multiple types of zeolitic frameworks in one
particle (Type II-2) is the main way of realizing a micropore
combination. A multi-micropore structure with fault stacking
orders and thereby unique acid and porous characteristics may
make the zeolite a very special catalyst.194,195 So far, a lot of
co-crystallized zeolites, including MFI/MEL, MWW/FER and
MAZ/MFI, have been synthesized and performed well in cracking,
FCC gasoline upgrading and aromatization reactions. Remark-
ably, eﬀorts to determine the detailed framework structures of
co-crystallized zeolites with possible multi-periods to define
their space group, or even exploiting these new types of zeolites,
is very meaningful for the future.196–198
Moreover, one significant progress for zeo-catalysts is the
development of frameworks with multiple-level pore models
(Type II-3). This type of zeolite with a multi-micropore system in
one crystal could not only retain the accessibility of guest
molecules to acid sites, but also promote the selectivity for
the reactant/intermediate/products, making it a good candidate
for the specific demands of industry. Zeolites with bi-modal
micropore systems, such as MOR zeolite with a 12- and 8-R pore
system, MWW zeolite with a 10- and 12-R half-supercage and
EUO zeolite with a 10-R pore and 12-R side pocket were developed
and tested in industrial processes.199,200 It is reasonably inferred
that more kinds of zeolite with inherent multi-micropore
systems, such as ZSM-57 zeolite (MFS) with 10- and 8-R pore
systems, ZSM-4 zeolite (MAZ) with 12- and 8-R and MCM-68
(MSE) zeolite with 12- and 10-R pore systems, will find actual
industrial applications.
3.3
Zeolites with hierarchical micro-meso-macropore systems
(Type III)
Recently, a lot of macro-meso-microporous composite materials
(Type III-1) have been prepared and described in several
reviews.41,201–205 From our point of view, heterogeneous catalytic
reactions in porous materials are normally conducted with a
complex reaction network, which involves the synergy of a series
of elementary steps and paths, such as adsorption, desorption
and diffusion of reactants/intermediates/products into and out of
the pores and the co-operation/competition of several reactions
on various active sites. Hierarchical porous systems, composed of
macro-, meso- and micropores, are therefore an ideal multifunc-
tional microreactor model for highly efficient catalysis. In detail,
lots of active sites are present on the walls of the hierarchical
pores to catalyze the reactions, while the connective channels in

this hierarchical system will benefit the diffusion of molecules.
As a result, the smaller molecules would exhibit a higher diffusion
ability and could easily arrive at the active sites in the micropores,
while larger molecules could react better in the meso- or macro-
pores. Hence, no matter if the reactions are for small or large
molecules or tandem reactions from large molecules to small
ones or vice versa, hierarchical porous materials usually display a
higher catalytic activity compared to traditional catalysts. Besides,
the products could escape easily from the interior of the pore due
to the presence of a large amount of meso- and macropores,
prohibiting further reaction and coking formation. Thus, block-
age of the micropores seldom occurs which ensures a good anti-
coking ability of the hierarchical porous catalyst. Overall, the
distribution of products and the stability of the catalysts could
be well improved and tailored using a hierarchical pore system.
Since the reactants/products mainly diﬀuse into or out of the
zeolite through the framework channels, controlling the velocities
of in-pore mass transfer and diﬀusion would be very important
even in one crystal zeolite.206–210 An attractive approach is the
construction of hierarchical pores (in particular, a meso-
microporous material) in one crystal (Type III-2) that is able
to hold the structural stability and acidity of the zeolite and at
the same time avoid the negative impact on diffusion of
traditional zeolites. In particular, the improved connectivity
of hierarchical pore systems can promote the porous material
to be of commercial use. The successful preparation of meso-
porous ZSM-5, beta, and Y zeolites opens a new window on
zeolite catalysis and brings great potential for their industria-
lization once the expensive templates can be replaced.
It is reasonable to speculate that by adjusting the porosity,
connectivity and hierarchy of the pore system by controlling the
composition and hierarchical pore distribution of the zeo-
catalyst, either in particles of the whole composite or in the
zeolitic crystals themselves, the accessibility of the active sites
and the diﬀusivity can be precisely regulated. As a result, the
activity and product distribution of the whole reaction network
can be theoretically predicted.
4. Summary and outlook
As a novel porous system would be able to achieve the compro-
mise between shape selectivity and catalytic activity to maximize
its benefits, the model construction of a pore system would not
only be able to well control the total activity and product distribu-
tion of the whole reaction network, but also surpass or replace the
current catalysts and bring about new technologies for new
reactions for industry. The advancement of pore architecture in
petrochemical processes has been thoroughly described. From
unimodal to multi-modal-pore industrialized systems, pore archi-
tectures with pore opening sizes and interior spaces deliberately
defined and regulated definitely need to be considered. With the
requirements in contemporary industry of enhancing catalytic
eﬃciency and environmental protection, the further design of zeo-
catalysts should pursue directions along (1) the creation of multi-
pore structures through either physical or chemical integration of
micro–micro pores by co-crystallization of various zeolites, (2) the
creation of zeolite crystals with novel frameworks with both
intrinsic micro- and mesoporosity, and (3) the development of
hierarchical pore systems via the coordination of designed
ratio, size and space distributions and interconnectivity of
macro-, meso- and micropores either in one crystal or their
composites.
The evident relationship between the textural properties or
topologies of pore systems and their catalytic performance has
been and is being comprehensively investigated,211–213 although
the reasoning for the orientation, distribution, connectivity and
hierarchy of the porous systems of industrialized zeolites is still
ambiguous. Besides, the crystallization processes or mecha-
nisms of the mesoporous frameworks should also be investi-
gated for zeo-catalysis for industrial applications. Last but not
least, the exploitation of new zeolite frameworks with promising
architectures is another significant direction for zeo-catalysts.
Corresponding fabrication strategies with one-pot procedures or
even more simple operations on a large scale are greatly required
to meet the more economical, greener and sustainable standards
of industry.
Apart from traditional processes, acidic zeolites could be
used as catalyst supports or as co-catalysts in some important
chemical processes, such as the Fischer–Tropsch (FT)214,215
process and biochemical or fine reactions.216–220 In the FT
synthesis, the utilization of hierarchical zeolites e.g., mesoporous
ZSM-5, would be beneficial to the rational design of catalysts with
controlled product selectivity due to their efficient mass-transport
properties. In biochemical and fine chemical processes,216–219
the application of multi-functional or zeo-microcapsules could
not only provide a confined space which greatly hinders the
occurrence of side reactions and gives rise to high selectivity,
but could also produce an isolation effect for the leakage and
poisoning of active species. It is reasonable to predict that pore
system construction would also be of great significance for
these processes.
