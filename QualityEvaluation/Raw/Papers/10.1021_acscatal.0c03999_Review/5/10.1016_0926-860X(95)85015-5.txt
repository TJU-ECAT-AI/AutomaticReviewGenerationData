Abstract 
An attempt 
to use carbon dioxide as a diluent and oxidant in the dehydrogenation 
of ethylbenzene 
to styrene was carried out over an activated carbon-supported 
iron catalyst (Fe 17 wt.-%) at 773-973 
K, CO,/ethylbenzene=50-70 
mol/mol 
and W/F= 30-120 g h/mol. An addition of 20-30 mol-% 
lithium nitrate to iron resulted in a significant increase in the catalytic activity. The highest yield of 
styrene (40.45%) 
with more than 90% selectivity was obtained at a ratio of lithium to iron of O.l- 
0.2 (moVmo1). 
In addition to styrene, carbon monoxide and water were formed as products. This 
indicated that the reaction, proceeds via an oxidative dehydrogenation 
mechanism. 
Added lithium 
nitrate was converted into lithium ferrite during the treatment of an iron-lithium 
co-loaded activated 
carbon catalyst under carbon dioxide at 973 K. Lithium ferrite thus formed would be an active center 
of the reaction.

1. Introduction 
Large amounts of styrene (ST) are commercially 
produced (more than 2 million 
tons per year in Japan) by dehydrogenation 
of ethylbenzene 
(EB ) using iron oxide 
based catalysts. The dehydrogenation 
reaction is carried out in an adiabatic reactor 
with a steam to ethylbenzene 
molar ratio of lo-15 mol/mol 
(excess steam), at 
873-923 K under atmospheric pressure [ l-71. 
Several investigations 
on addition of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation 
of 
ethylbenzene 
have been published 
[ 8-101, and in those papers the presence of

carbon dioxide was reported to depress the catalytic activity of the iron based 
catalyst. 
Improvement 
of the dehydrogenation 
process in order to reduce the energy 
consumption 
is of current interest. Grunewald and Drago [ 1 
l] reported the oxi- 
dative dehydrogenation 
of ethylbenzene 
to styrene using a pyrolyzed polyacryloni- 
trile carbon catalyst with air, which resulted in a considerable 
decrease of the 
reaction temperature. Guen-ero et al. [ 121 recently used graphite or activated carbon 
as catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation 
of ethylbenzene. 
Recently, several attempts to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for methane to 
give hydrogen 
and carbon monoxide 
have been carried out [ 13-151. However, 
dehydrogenation 
of ethylbenzene 
using carbon dioxide has not been reported to 
our knowledge. 
In the present paper, we will deal with the dehydrogenation 
of ethylbenzene 
to 
give styrene catalyzed 
by iron oxide supported 
on an activated carbon in the 
presence of excess carbon dioxide. 
2. Experimental 
2.1. Materials 
All chemicals were purchased from commercial sources, and used without further 
purification. Fine particles of activated carbon (Darco-G60, 
1098 m2/g) and gran- 
ular activated carbon (Wako, 10-30 mesh, 1103 m2/g) were used as a support. 
Iron oxide catalysts were prepared by mixing iron oxide (a-Fe,O,) 
powder and 
an aqueous solution of potassium carbonate in the desired molar ratio. The resulting 
pastes were dried at 393 K overnight and calcined at 873 K for 4 h in an air stream 
[81. 
Carbon-supported 
iron catalysts were prepared by impregnating a carbon support 
with aqueous solutions of iron nitrate. Carbon-supported 
iron catalysts co-loaded 
with alkali metal and alkaline earth metal were prepared by either successive 
impregnation 
of a carbon support with solutions of an iron nitrate and an alkali 
metal (Li, Na, K) nitrate or alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca) nitrate, or by co- 
impregnation of a solution containing both salts. After the metal salts impregnation 
by immersing the support for 24 h in aqueous solutions, water was evaporated in 
vacua, and then the activated carbon supported iron was dried at 343 K under 
reduced pressure. 
2.2. Apparatus and procedure 
The reaction was carried out in a conventional 
flow type reactor made of a 
stainless steel tube (4.3 mm I.D., 8 mm O.D., 400 mm length) operated at atmos- 
pheric pressure. 50-200 mg of catalyst was placed in the center of the reactor by 
M. Sugino et al. /Applied 
Catalysis A: General 121 (1995) 125-137 
127 
using a quartz glass wool plug. The reaction was carried out at 723-973 K for 2- 
10 h. Before introducing ethylbenzene 
into the reactor, the catalyst was pretreated 
as follows: it was heat-treated under an argon stream from room temperature to 973 
K at a heating rate of 100 K/min and was maintained at this temperature 
for 10 
min. Then the catalyst was oxidized with carbon dioxide at 973 K for 10 min, and 
then the reactor was cooled to the desired reaction temperature under a stream of 
carbon dioxide The effect of the carbon dioxide pretreatment 
was examined, but 
no significant effect of pretreatment 
period was observed in the range of 10 to 30 
min. Therefore, the pretreatment period was set to 10 min for most of the runs. 
Ethylbenzene 
was fed (ca. 1.3 mmol/h) 
to the reactor by passing carbon dioxide 
(30 ml/min) 
through the ethylbenzene 
saturator thermostated 
at 3 15 K. The efflu- 
ent from the reactor was condensed 
in two traps containing heptane, externally 
cooled in an ice water bath. 
Analyses of reaction products were carried out with a FID gas chromatograph 
(Shimadzu GC14APF) 
equipped with a 3 mm X 3 m glass column packed with 
Silicon SE-30. Analyses of gaseous products (CO, CO*, CH4) were carried out 
with a gas chromatograph 
(Shimadzu GC8APT) 
equipped with a TCD using a 3 
mm X 2.5 m stainless steel column packed with an activated carbon. The amount 
of water formed during the reaction was determined by the Karl Fischer method 
using an Aquacounter 
(Hiranuma AQV-5s) . 
The amount of carbon deposited on the catalysts was determined by measuring 
the change in the weight of the catalyst bed before and after the reaction. 
2.3. Analyses of catalysts 
Iron species before and after the dehydrogenation 
were analyzed with powder 
X-ray diffraction using a X-ray diffractometer 
(Rigaku Geiger Flex 2013) with Fe 
Ka radiation. The surface area of the catalyst was measured with a BET single 
point method using nitrogen as adsorbate at 77 K.

I. Activities of various catalysts 
The results of catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation 
of ethylbenzene 
with 
various iron oxide based catalysts are shown in Table 1. The Numerals in paren- 
theses, indicating features of the catalyst in Table 1 and other parts of this paper, 
denote amounts (in mmol) of the respective 
metal species loaded per gram of 
carbon. Specific activity indicates moles of styrene produced per mole of iron in 
an hour. In the dehydrogenation 
carried out under a carbon dioxide flow at 823 K, 
as shown in run 1, in the absence of a catalyst, only a very low conversion 
of 
ethylbenzene 
was observed. In the oxidative dehydrogenation

air, activated carbon [ 1 
I] and graphite [ 121 were reported to be active catalysts. 
Active carbon support itself was used as a catalyst (run 2)) and considerable styrene 
yield was obtained 
(9.8%). 
A conventional 
a-Fe203-K&O3 
catalyst used for 
styrene production in a commercial plant did not show significant catalytic activity 
in carbon dioxide. This is consistent with a previous observation 
[ 161 that carbon 
dioxide depletes the dehydrogenation 
activity of a Fe,O, catalyst. 
Considerable 
conversion 
of ethylbenzene 
was observed 
with an iron-loaded 
activated carbon catalyst (runs 4,5). When the reaction was conducted in an argon 
flow, a very low catalytic activity was observed with considerable carbon deposition 
in the reactor (run 6). Therefore 
use of carbon dioxide is indispensable 
in this 
reaction. 
Since commercial 
iron catalyst is known to be promoted 
with alkali metals, 
effects of an addition of alkali and alkaline earth metal salts were examined 
[ lo]. 
Addition of an alkali metal salt enhanced the ethylbenzene 
conversion as shown in 
runs 7-l 1. In particular, lithium salt markedly enhanced the dehydrogenation 
of 
ethylbenzene. 
The order of activity of alkali or alkaline earth metals on the styrene 
formation is as follows: Li > Na > Ca > Ba > K. The order of the alkali metals 
in the enhancement 
of the iron catalyst is that of decreasing the ionic radius. 
Fig. 1 illustrates effects of an amount of lithium on the iron-loaded carbon catalyst 
at a fixed iron loading level. The highest conversions of ethylbenzene 
(40-45%) 
was obtained at lithium to iron ratios of 0.1-0.2 (mol/mol) 
. On the other hand the 
selectivity 
to styrene remained constant within a lithium to iron ratio of 0 to 0.3 
and decreased 
markedly above a ratio of 0.3 (mol/mol). 
When lithium-loaded 
activated carbon was used as a catalyst, only a slight conversion 
of ethylbenzene 
was obtained. This indicates that excess lithium seems to block active sites. How-

ever, the decrease in the selectivity at a higher loading level of lithium to iron can 
not be accounted for at present. 
Fig. 2 represents ethylbenzene 
conversion and selectivity to styrene as a function 
of loading level of iron at a constant lithium to iron ratio (Li/Fe = 0.1 mol/mol) . 
Ethylbenzene 
conversion increased with an increase in the loading level of iron to 
3 mm01 on 1 g of carbon, and above this level the conversion 
of ethylbenzene 
leveled off. The styrene selectivity reached 90% at 1.5-3.0 mm01 of iron to a gram 
of carbon and gradually decreased with an increase in the loading level of iron and 
lithium.

Two types of carbon supports, Dar-co G-60 and Wako granular activated carbon, 
exhibited similar effects as seen in run 7 in Table 1 and run 2 1 in Table 3, although 
different reaction conditions were employed. When Darco G-60 was used, a higher 
pressure drop was observed due to a larger packing density of the support. There- 
fore, with Darco G-60 a higher W/F (70) was employed as compared to the case 
of granular activated carbon ( Wl F = 24). 
The effect 
of the reaction 
temperature 
on the dehydrogenation 
activity 
of 
Fe( 3)Li( 0.3) /AC catalyst was examined. Ethylbenzene 
conversion, styrene yield 
and selectivity to styrene as a function of reaction temperature are shown in Fig. 3. 
With increasing reaction temperature, 
ethylbenzene 
conversion 
increased mono- 
tonically, and styrene yield increased from 20% at 773 K to 47% at 873 K, whereas 
the selectivity to styrene gradually decreased from 99% at 773 K to 83% at 873 K. 
Further increases in the reaction temperature 
resulted in increased ethylbenzene 
conversions 
with larger decreases in the styrene selectivity. This indicates that at 
higher temperature 
thermal decomposition 
of ethylbenzene 
did occur to give car- 
bonaceous materials on the surface of the catalyst. 
The specific activity was calculated to be 3.7 mol styrene/mol 
Fe h at a reaction 
temperature 
of 773 K; a value higher than 1, indicating that iron species acted 
catalytically 
above this temperature. 
Although we did not determine the iron dis- 
persion, the number of active centers of this catalyst should be much lower than 
the amount of loaded iron, and consequently 
much larger turn over numbers would 
be expected than the specific activity indicated in this paper.

oxidize iron to magnetite, oxidation with carbon dioxide was carried out before the 
dehydrogenation, 
since oxidation with oxygen or air considerably 
burns out the 
carbon support. Lund and Dumesic [ 17,181 reported that upon reduction in a 15% 
CO-85% 
CO2 gas mixture, iron oxides in a silica-supported 
iron catalyst were 
converted to Fe,O,. One of the present authors [ 191 demonstrated 
an iron redox 
cycle of metallic iron and magnetite in iron catalyzed carbon gasification 
with 
carbon dioxide. 
The effect of the pretreatment period at 973 K with carbon dioxide on the styrene 
yield and the selectivity to styrene is shown in Fig. 4. The conversion of ethylben- 
zene was constant up to a pretreatment 
period of 30 min, but a slight increase in 
the styrene yield was observed with increasing pretreatment 
to 30 min, and then 
the styrene yield decreased drastically with increasing pretreatment time. The selec- 
tivity to styrene showed maxima at 30 min, then rapidly decreased with an increase 
in the treatment time. These results indicate that longer pretreatment 
of the iron 
catalyst with carbon dioxide is not necessary for higher dehydrogenation 
activity, 
due to the rapid oxidation of iron on carbon with carbon dioxide. Decreases in the 
specific activity with increasing carbon dioxide treatment time may be accounted 
for by the agglomeration 
of iron species on activated carbon due to the slight 
gasification of the carbon support in carbon dioxide. Since the carbon support could 
be selectively 
gasified on the iron loaded sites, a loss of the support may directly 
cause aggregation of dispersed iron [ 191.

to styrene. In these experiments, 
W/F was changed by varying the amount of 
catalyst charged under a constant ethylbenzene 
feed rate. The organic substances 
detected in addition to styrene were unreacted ethylbenzene, 
toluene and benzene. 
With an increase in the contact time, yield of ethylbenzene 
increased 
and the 
selectivity 
to styrene decreased. 
However, 
the increase in styrene yield is not 
proportional 
to the contact time. The decrease in the specific activity with an 
increase in contact time is remarkable. 
Cracking of ethylbenzene 
to benzene and 
toluene occurred slightly (OS-1.0%) 
with increasing contact time. However, the 
amounts of these products were not large enough to account for the decrease in the 
selectivity to styrene. These results seem to indicate that the decrease in the selec- 
tivity to styrene could be accounted for by thermal decomposition 
of ethylbenzene 
and styrene. 
3.4. Activity decay of the catalyst 
Changes in the specific activity against time-on-stream 
by using Fe/AC and Fe- 
Li/AC at a reaction temperature 
of 823 K are shown in Fig. 6. In both catalysts, 
the specific activity decreased 
gradually with the progress of the reaction. The 
decrease in the specific activity of the Fe( 3)Li(OS) 
/AC catalyst is not so remark- 
able as that in the specific activity of the Fe( 3) /AC catalyst. Decreases in the 
styrene selectivity in both catalysts showed similar tendencies as in the decreases 
in the specific activity. This observation shows that the addition of lithium contrib- 
utes to a decreased 
deactivation 
of the catalyst during the dehydrogenation 
of 
ethylbenzene 
in carbon dioxide. 
In order to reveal the origin of catalyst deactivation, 
we measured the surface 
area of the fresh and the used catalyst. As seen in Table 2, decreases in the surface

area of the used catalysts were remarkable 
in all cases. In particular, the surface 
area of the used catalyst in run 14 after 10 h reaction time decreased to half that of 
the fresh catalyst. Such a decrease in the surface area seems to be due to the 
deposition of carbon on the iron catalyst. Considerable 
increases in the catalyst 
weight were observed in separate experiments 
(see runs 21 and 22)) although the 
reaction was carried out in a stainless steel reactor, the accuracy of the measurement 
of the weight change before and after the reaction was poor. Decreases in the 
styrene selectivity with increasing reaction temperature 
and contact time seem to 
be ascribable to carbon deposition.

peaks of magnetite and iron carbide were observed (Fig. 7a). However, peaks due 
to lithium species were not seen. Since, as reported previously 
[ 191, reduction of 
magnetite to metallic iron occurred above 1023 K, the diffraction patterns in Fig. 
7a are quite reasonable. 
Fig. 7b shows a diffraction 
pattern of iron and lithium

followed by the same heat treatment 
(973 K, 10 min) under argon atmosphere.

Figs. 7b and c show diffraction peaks ascribed to lithium ferrite ( LiFeSO marked 
A). It must be noted that lithium ferrite was formed on the carbon surface at a 
temperature as low as 923 K. In general, lithium ferrite was reported to form above 
1273 K [20,21]. 
Since the atomic ratio of lithium to iron in LiFe,O, 
agrees with the optimum 
lithium to iron ratio (0.1 to 0.2) for ethylbenzene 
dehydrogenation 
and the inten- 
sities of the diffraction 
peaks ascribed to lithium ferrite was weakened by the 
reaction with ethylbenzene 
in the carbon dioxide stream, LiFe,O, plays an important 
role in the formation 
of active centers. Ferrite has been reported to be an active 
catalyst in the selective oxidative dehydrogenation 
of butene to butadiene. How- 
ever, common promoters are Zn, Mg and Cr [ 22-261.

peaks attributed to lithium ferrite disappeared, and those ascribed 
to magnetite were hardly observed, but those assigned to iron carbide increased in 
intensity. We consider disappearance 
of ferrite and magnetite as one of the factors 
causing activity decay. An increase in the intensity of the iron carbide phase and a 
decrease in the magnetite phase show clearly that the role of carbon dioxide in the 
dehydrogenation 
of ethylbenzene 
to styrene is to keep the lithium ferrite and mag- 
netite phases in the catalytic process. 
3.4. Redox cycle of the catalyst 
Specific activities higher than 1 mean iron oxide acted as a real catalyst. In 
addition, the disappearance 
of the iron oxide phase in the reaction under argon 
atmosphere 
suggests the possibility of a redox cycle of the iron oxide in lithium 
ferrite with ethylbenzene 
and carbon dioxide, as shown below:

In order to confirm above reactions, the amounts of carbon monoxide and water 
in the effluent were determined. 
Results are summarized 
in Table 3. When the 
reactions were carried out without catalyst or with an activated carbon support, 
very low styrene yields were observed together with small amounts of water and 
carbon monoxide 
(runs 19, 20). The reaction in argon flow exhibited a similar 
result (run 22). In run 23 the amounts of carbon monoxide ( 1.53 mmol) and water 
formed ( 1.97 mmol) are in fair agreement with the amount of styrene formed (2.01 
mmol). These results clearly show dehydrogenation 
of ethylbenzene 
with iron- 
loaded carbon catalyst proceeded with a redox cycle shown in Eqs. ( 1) and (2). 
In other words, carbon dioxide acted as an oxidant in the reaction.

4. Conclusion 
Carbon-supported iron catalysts exhibited a high styrene yield in the presence of 
excess carbon dioxide. An addition of 0.1 to 0.3 mol of lithium nitrate to 1 mol of 
iron catalyst supported on carbon resulted in a significant increase in catalytic 
activity. 
X-ray diffraction analyses of lithium promoted carbon-supported iron indicated 
that iron and lithium on the surface of the carbon support were converted into 
magnetite and lithium ferrite under pretreatment with carbon dioxide at 973 K. 
Since the lithium ferrite phase disappeared in the reaction of ethylbenzene in an 
argon atmosphere, lithium ferrite is considered to be an active phase of the catalyst. 
The amounts of carbon monoxide and water produced during the reaction agreed 
well with the amount of styrene. The results indicate a redox cycle a follows: ( 1) 
lattice oxygen of iron oxide in lithium ferrite abstracts hydrogen from ethylbenzene 
to give styrene; (2) carbon dioxide oxidizes oxygen defects in the iron oxide phase 
in lithium ferrite.
