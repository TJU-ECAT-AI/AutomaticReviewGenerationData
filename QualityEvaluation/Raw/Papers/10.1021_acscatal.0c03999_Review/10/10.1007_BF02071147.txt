The oxidative condensation products of the title 
reaction 
are catalytically active, presumably 
because sulfur enters into their composition.

It is known that SO 
2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent 
for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]. In most detail t~ede- 
hydrogenation of ethylbenzene [4-7] has been studied. It has 
been established [4-6] that in the course of this reaction on 
u 
one can observe the deposition of oxidative condensa- 
tion products (OCP). The specific activity of this catalyst in- 
creases, which is attributed to the greater ability of OCP to 
enhance the reaction compared to that of the initial u 
As far as the dehydrogenation of propane by SO 
2 is concerned, 
it is known that the application of iron oxides supported on 
activated carbon as catalysts permits to obtain high yields of 
propylene [2J. The aim of the present study was to investigate 
propane dehydrogenation by SO 
2 on carbon, (SBET=436 m2/g) ob- 
tained by ash granulation (the authors thank V.A. Semikolenov 
for the donation of this catalyst).

Experiments were carried out under flow and pulse cata- 
lytic conditions. Every experiment was performed with a fresh 
catalyst sample. The free volume of the reactor was filled with 
the 0.25-0.5 mm fraction of quartz glass. Prior to the experi- 
ments the catalyst was purged by helium for 1 h at T=913 K. 
Reaction mixtures had the composition 
(vol%) :R (i0 C3H8+90 He), 
SO (10 S02+90 He), RSO (i0 C3H8+I0 SO2+80 He) and S (helium 
saturated at 423-433 K by sulfur vapors with S8=(2.6-3.1)xi0 -2 
vol.% [8]). In pulse experiments the catalyst activity was cha- 
racterized by the amount of propylene 
(mol) formed per one pulse 
(1.75 cm3). 
Carrying out the reaction under flow conditions at a con- 
stant contact time indicates that propane conversion decreases 
with time (Table I). In this case the surface area of the cata- 
lyst diminishes and one can observe disbalance with respect to 
carbon. These data suggest that during the reaction OCP are 
formed on the catalyst surface.

To establish the mechanism of participation of the oxidant 
propylene formation and OCP, pulses of either propane (R), or 
propane with an oxidizing agent (RSO) or separate pulses of pro- 
pane and an oxidizing agent (R and SO) were admitted to the 
catalyst. The content of propylene formed upon admitting R 
(Fig. la) is low and varies slightly from pulse to pulse. Upon

admitting SO after a pulse of R to the catalyst, no propylene 
is formed, which indicates the weak adsorption of propane. The 
amount of propylene formed in a pulse of R admitted to a carbon 
pretreated by 50 pulses, is close to that after a pulse of R 
admitted to a fresh sample (0.30 and 0.33xi06 mol, respectively). 
Upon admitting RSO pulses (Fig. Ib), the amount of propylene 
formed after the first pulse is almost 2.5 times higher than 
after R pulses and increases with the pulse number. 
The significantly higher yield of propylene after the first 
pulse of RSO compared to R can be attributed to the concerted 
mechanism of propane interaction with SO 
2. Its increase from 
pulse to pulse can be due to the accumulation of catalytically

more active OCP on carbon. The suggestion of the high catalytic 
activity of OCP is also confirmed by the formation rates of 
propylene (Table i) calculated taking into account changes in 
the catalyst surface area during the reaction. It is seen that 
after i00 min of catalyst operation the formation rate of pro- 
pylene (in mol/s m 
2) is approximately four times as high as 
after 3 min. OCP deposition increases the portion of a step- 
wise mechanism (Fig. 2). It is seen that the difference in the

amounts of propylene formed after R and RSO pulses, which was 
ascribed to the contribution of the concerted mechanism 
for 
propylene interaction with SO2, remains unchanged as the amount 
of OCP rises, whereas that of propylene formed after R pulses 
increases. 
Since it is known that both sulfurized catalysts [9-103 
and elemental sulfur [3,113 
can selectively enhance the de- 
hydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it was of particular interest 
to establish the dependence of catalytic activity on S 
con- 
centration in the sample. 
In treating carbon with sulfur-containing compounds, sul-

fur can be inserted into the carbon molecular structure [12-13]. 
To establish the sulfur contribution to the reaction under 
study, we have carried out the following experiments. An R 
pulse was admitted to the initial catalyst and the amount of 
evolved propylene was analyzed. Then certain amounts of S, RSO 
or SO were passed through the catalyst and again an R pulse 
was admitted and the amount of propylene was analyzed, and so 
on. Propylene yield was used to determine changes in the de- 
hydrogenation properties of the catalyst (Fig. 3). It is seen

that with increasing amount of preadsorbed sulfur (for RSO it 
was determined approximately, since the analysis for elemental 
sulfur had not been performed) the propylene yield after an R 
pulse 
also rises. The results suggest that the sulfur concen- 
tration affects significantly the catalytic properties of OCP. 
For the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene by SO 
2 in the pre- 
sence of y-Al203 it has been shown previously [63 that the con- 
centration of sulfur in OCP rises as they are depositing. Appa- 
rently, a similar phenomenon also takes place in the reaction 
examined. It can be suggested that the sulfur entering into

the OCP composition participates in propane activation and in- 
creases the contribution of the stepwise mechanism with growing 
yield of OCP.
