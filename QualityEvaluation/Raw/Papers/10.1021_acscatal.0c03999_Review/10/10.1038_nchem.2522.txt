Catalyst design for natural-gas upgrading through
oxybromination chemistry
Vladimir Paunović, Guido Zichittella, Maximilian Moser, Amol P. Amrute and Javier Pérez-Ramírez*
Natural gas contains large volumes of light alkanes, and its abundant reserves make it an appealing feedstock for value-
added chemicals and fuels. However, selectively activating the C–H bonds in these useful hydrocarbons is one of the
greatest challenges in catalysis. Here we report an attractive oxybromination method for the one-step functionalization
of methane under mild conditions that integrates gas-phase alkane bromination with heterogeneously catalysed
HBr oxidation, a step that is usually executed separately. Catalyst-design strategies to provide optimal synergy between
these two processes are discussed. Among many investigated material families, vanadium phosphate (VPO) is identiﬁed
as the best oxybromination catalyst, as it provides selectivity for CH3Br up to 95% and stable operation for over
100 hours on stream. The outstanding performance of VPO is rationalized by its high activity in HBr oxidation and low
propensity for methane and bromomethane oxidation. Data on the oxybromination of ethane and propane over VPO
suggest that the reaction network for higher alkanes is more complex.
T
he emerging conventional and non-conventional natural-gas
reserves,
which
contain
copious
amounts
of
methane
(75–99 mol%), but also of ethane (1–15 mol%) and propane
(1–10 mol%), offer an exciting potential as a feedstock for value-
added chemicals and fuels1–10. However, currently less than 10%
of the global natural-gas production is used for the manufacture
of commodities and the rest is burned for heating, transport and
electricity-generation purposes1,2. This reﬂects the inadequacy of
state-of-the-art technologies for natural-gas upgrading, inevitably
intermediated
by
energy-
and
capital-intensive
reforming
processes1,2. Thus, more-efﬁcient methods that allow a selective
one-step functionalization of the rather inert C–H bonds in
methane and other alkanes have been recognized as important
goals in catalysis research. Among various strategies proposed,
halogen-based processes are particularly attractive as they enable a
homolytic C–H bond scission in the gas phase to proceed in a selec-
tive fashion under relatively mild conditions (T < 800 K, P ≈1 bar
(Fig. 1, middle left))1,11,12.
Bromination is preferred over chlorination as it provides a high
selectivity for monohaloalkanes (also referred to as alkyl halides)
and facile halogen elimination1 because of the weaker C–Br bond
(284.9 kJ mol−1) compared with the C–Cl bond (338.9 kJ mol−1).
Notably, the bromination of alkane to give bromoalkane, and the
subsequent dehydrobromination of the latter to give a wide range
of valuable products release HBr (Fig. 1, middle). The efﬁcient
recovery of bromine from the by-product HBr is a decisive factor
to realize this approach on an industrial scale. The gas-phase
oxidation of HBr over the recently developed robust RuO2-, IrO2-,
CeO2- or TiO2-based systems, which generally proceeds at much
lower temperatures compared with those of HCl oxidation, can be
implemented as a separate step to close the bromine cycle13,14
(Fig. 1, top left). However, the integration of the alkane function-
alization with the HBr recovery in a single-step process via an
oxybromination reaction (Fig. 1, bottom left) is conceptually a
more-advanced strategy, as it enables process intensiﬁcation and a
theoretical 100% halogen-atom efﬁciency15–19. In fact, the oxyhalo-
genation of light alkanes, which has a long history dating back to the
ﬁrst half of the 20th century20, has been forecast as the most cost-
effective technology for natural-gas upgrading1. Different materials,
such as noble Ru- and Rh-based catalysts, as well as non-noble
FePO4 and CeO2 systems, have been reported to catalyse the oxybro-
mination of methane, which is typically claimed to proceed as a het-
erogeneously catalysed reaction15–19. Besides the polybromination
that leads to CH2Br2 formation, COx generation is the main chal-
lenge in this reaction because it eventually limits the yield of the
brominated products.
The present study aims to develop an oxybromination process for
the selective functionalization of methane through symbiosis
between heterogeneously catalysed HBr oxidation and gas-phase
alkane bromination, sustained by radicals continuously supplied
from the bromine pool that is, in turn, regenerated on the catalyst
surface by molecular oxygen. The C–H bond scission is thus
decoupled from the highly reactive oxygen species on the catalyst,
which would generally promote the undesired deeper oxidation of
alkane and brominated products. The key to accomplish this micro-
level spatiotemporal management of the complex heterogeneous
gas-phase network is to ﬁnd a catalyst that is able to oxidize HBr,
but is inert with respect to the C–H bonds of the carbon-containing
molecules. Owing to their stability and operational window, which
generally coincides with that of the gas-phase alkane bromination
(Fig. 1, left), the above-mentioned HBr oxidation catalysts13,14 are
interesting candidates to investigate in the oxybromination reaction,
although their strong oxidizing character is likely to cause substan-
tial combustion. These undesired oxidation reactions can be sup-
pressed by applying the concept of redox-site isolation through
dispersion in a quasi-inert matrix, such as phosphates, and
thereby enabling better control of the surface-active oxygen
species, as well as ﬁne tuning of the redox and acid–base proper-
ties21,22. The phosphate incorporation also ensures that the
redox centres are more stable under the highly corrosive oxybromi-
nation conditions23, and the involvement of lattice oxygen (the
Mars–van Krevelen mechanism)21,22 makes the oxidation less severe.
Here the catalytic activity of different oxides and phosphates in
the oxybromination of methane was investigated systematically

and a set of new active oxybromination catalysts identiﬁed.
Vanadium phosphate (VPO) was observed to be the best, with an
operating temperature approximately 100 K lower than those of pre-
vious reports15–19. Performance differences among various catalysts
were related to their activities in the oxidation of HBr, methane and
bromomethanes, which are proposed to constitute the key descrip-
tors of the oxybromination potential. The mechanism of methane
oxybromination over VPO, which involves heterogeneous HBr oxi-
dation coupled with gas-phase methane bromination, was sup-
ported experimentally and, based on that, feed-optimization
strategies to maximize the CH3Br selectivity and productivity are
discussed. Finally, the oxybromination of the more-activated light
alkanes, such as ethane and propane, over VPO was investigated.
Results and discussion
Oxybromination of methane over oxide and phosphate catalysts.
The gas-phase oxybromination of methane over different families of
catalysts
was
studied
using
a
ﬁxed-bed
reactor
set-up
(Supplementary Fig. 1). The concept of oxybromination based on
in situ coupling of the catalysed HBr oxidation with the non-
catalysed
gas-phase
bromination
was
ﬁrst
approached
by
evaluating the representative HBr oxidation catalysts, TiO2, RuO2
and CeO2, in the oxybromination of methane. The catalytic tests
revealed a substantial productivity of CH3Br and CH2Br2 over
these materials, being signiﬁcantly higher than the ‘background’
activity of the empty quartz microreactor (Fig. 2). The highest
yields of the brominated compounds were observed over CeO2,
which was previously reported to be an efﬁcient oxybromination
catalyst19. CH2Br2 generation is a common challenge in both the
bromination and oxybromination of methane, particularly if the
mixture
of
bromomethanes
is
coupled
to
the
higher
hydrocarbons, with which CH2Br2 is known to favour aromatics
formation, and eventually it promotes catalyst deactivation because
of fouling6,24,25. Different strategies to convert CH2Br2 into methyl
bromide and higher hydrocarbons via reproportionation24 or
catalytic hydrodebromination reprocesses25, or acetic acid and its
derivates15, make this product yet to be utilized. Nevertheless, the
selectivity for the bromomethanes over the studied oxides was
seriously conﬂicted by CO2 generation, especially over RuO2 and
CeO2. Although the COx formation might appear as an inherent
drawback of the oxybromination approach, a substantial carbon
loss also occurs in the oxygen-free bromination of methane24 in
the form of coke deposition, which gives rise to a semicontinuous
reactor operation. Among the two carbon oxides, CO2 is easier to
separate, but the possibility to exploit CO as a carbonylation
reagent in a Monsanto-like process to yield acetic acid15 from
CH3Br
increases
the
overall
efﬁciency
of
the
carbon-atom
utilization. Thus, although a high yield of CH3Br is of prime
interest, it is in the ﬁrst place necessary to suppress the
undesirable CO2 formation, which is the only product of no
practical use in the halogen-mediated light-alkane upgrading
chain. This is not possible over the above-mentioned oxide
catalysts because of their strong oxidizing character, which relates
to the high mobility of the surface oxygen atoms, as well as to the
high concentration of the basic oxygen sites26–29. The latter
favours nucleophilic attack on the brominated compounds, and
ultimately results in overoxidation and combustion.
To mitigate these, metal phosphates (Fig. 2 and Supplementary
Table 1) are promising candidates with which to reconceive the
mild oxidation potential with a reduced oxygen basicity and high
stability under the corrosive reaction environment18,21–23,30–34. The
oxybromination tests performed over many phosphates show that,
besides the previously reported FePO4 catalyst18, Cu3(PO4)2,
CrPO4 and VPO are highly active in this reaction. In fact, VPO
provided the highest yield of the brominated compounds with
negligible CO2 productivity and thus emerged as the best catalyst
among all the investigated systems. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis

of the VPO sample (Supplementary Fig. 2) evidenced the substantial
bulk changes of the catalyst structure, which primarily involve the
reduction of the initial V(V) into V(IV) phases, although no
changes in the catalyst performance could be observed (see Fig. 3).
The operational window of all the active catalysts, including
those that were previously reported to catalyse this reaction, was
advantageously shifted to temperatures at least 100 K lower than
those in the earlier works on methane oxybromination15–19. This
marked increase in activity is attributed to the absence of water inhi-
bition when using dry HBr instead of its aqueous solution. The
latter is commonly used in the studies reported to date.
Evolution of the VPO structure in the oxybromination of
methane. The VPO catalyst was evaluated in a long run followed
by ex situ characterization of the samples recovered at different
times to gain insights into structural alterations of the starting
phase. Importantly, the conversion of methane as well as the
product distribution remained unchanged over 100 hours on
stream (Fig. 3a). However, XRD analysis of the samples collected
after quenching the reaction at 5, 15 and 40 hours indicated a
progressive transformation of the initial vanadium oxyphosphate
(VOPO4) phases into a reduced (VO)2P2O7 form (Fig. 3b) and
equilibration of the bulk-phase composition within the ﬁrst 15
hours of the reaction. The reduction of V5+ into V4+ was also
evidenced
by
a
temperature-programmed
reduction
with
hydrogen
(H2-TPR)
(Fig.
3c)
and
magic-angle
spinning
phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31P MAS NMR)
spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 3). The low-temperature peaks
in the H2-TPR proﬁles positioned at about 780 and 845 K are
attributed to the reduction of V5+ species into V4+ and V3+,
respectively35. These peaks gradually vanished over the reaction
time and were almost undetectable in the 40 hour sample.
Similarly, the strong signals located at around δ = 0 ppm in the
31P NMR spectra, which are characteristic of the V5+ states in
VOPO4
phases36,37,
were
substantially
reduced
over
time.
Nevertheless, NMR spectra demonstrated the presence of a small
amount of V5+ even after 40 hours on stream. An increase in
crystallinity over reaction time was observed from XRD, 31P MAS
NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Figs 3 and 4)
analyses and is corroborated by a decrease of the total surface area
of the used catalyst samples (Fig. 3b). Moreover, HRTEM
evidenced a transformation of the needle-like (fresh) particles into
cuboids
(40
hours)
and
the
continuous
presence
of
the
amorphous layer on the surface of the crystalline grains. This
layer was also observed in the n-butane oxidation to give maleic
anhydride over VPO catalysts and is thought to be crucial for its
performance in this reaction38. A more-detailed picture on the
nature of the active site needs further investigation, which is
beyond the scope of this manuscript.
Performance descriptors for the oxybromination catalyst. To
rationalize the performance differences of various catalyst classes, we
studied their behaviour in the reactions that are proposed to
constitute the key descriptors for the ultimate product distribution in
the oxybromination of methane (Fig. 4). These include HBr
oxidation, which is essential to enable a continuous (re)generation of
bromine along the catalyst bed, and the combustion of the
brominated products (CH3Br and CH2Br2) and methane, which are
responsible for the loss in the overall selectivity for the brominated
methanes. Temperatures at which 40% (T40) of HBr, CH3Br and
CH2Br2, and 2% (T2) of methane were converted were taken as the
relative measure of the catalyst activity in the corresponding
oxidation reactions. Based on the simple optimality criteria that states
a superior oxybromination catalyst should lead to high rates of HBr
oxidation with no combustion of methane or bromomethanes to
ensure high yields of the latter, the relative activities of the catalysts
were cross-compared by plotting them along the edges of the
catalytic pyramid (Fig. 4). From this presentation, the outstanding
oxybromination performance of VPO can be rationalized by its high
activity in HBr oxidation, which is comparable to those of CeO2 and
TiO2, and relatively low combustion activity, which makes this
catalyst the closest to the apex of the pyramid.

oxidation of methane over VPO and FePO4 under conditions
similar to those applied in the oxybromination reaction is rather
slow (Fig. 4). This points to a high activation barrier for the
catalytic C–H bond scission and hints that the gas-phase
bromination is a likely pathway for C–Br bond formation in the
oxybromination reaction. To verify this aspect, the following
experiments were conducted. First, gas-phase bromination was
performed over a bed of inert quartz particles that had a volume
typical of a catalyst bed in the oxybromination of methane
(Fig. 5a). The results demonstrated that the onset temperature of
∼675 K, the trends in methane conversion and the distribution of
brominated products in the bromination reaction are in a good
agreement with those in the oxybromination reaction (Figs 5a
and 6a). The only exception was CO formation in the latter
process. The addition of molecular oxygen to the bromination
mixture (Fig. 5a) did not change the product yields, except that
some CO was observed at 745 K, which testiﬁes to the absence of
any
inhibition
by
O2.
This
pronounced
difference
in
CO
productivity suggests that its formation in the oxybromination
reaction probably originates from the combustion of brominated
products on the catalysts, which is also reﬂected by lower T40
values
for
CH3Br
and
CH2Br2
combustion
over
catalysts
compared with that over inert SiC particles (Fig. 4). Second, the
quantiﬁcation
of
the
molecular
bromine
during
the
oxybromination over VPO showed that this was the main product
observed
at
low
temperatures
(∼88%
yield
at
90%
HBr
conversion) (Fig. 5b), which suggests the bromine desorption
occurs at low temperatures. With a rise in bed temperature (Tbed),
the increasing production of the bromomethanes is accompanied
by a decreasing bromine yield and HBr conversion, which
illustrates that the uptake of the evolved bromine by methane in
the
gas
phase
results
in
HBr
liberation.
These
results
unambiguously suggest that the formation of C–Br bonds in
methane oxybromination originates from a gas-phase reaction
between methane and bromine. To comprehend whether the
gas-phase free-radical chain reactions can be unfolded in our
experimental
conditions,
we
simulated
the
bromination
of
methane under conditions comparable to those applied in the
oxybromination
(Supplementary
Fig.
5).
This
revealed
that
signiﬁcant
methane
conversion
and
yields
of
brominated
products can be attained at the residence times estimated for the
void volume between the catalyst particles. Based on
this
consideration, a simpliﬁed reaction mechanism is proposed for
VPO. The bromine that is formed by the catalytic HBr oxidation
(equation (1)) initiates the gas-phase bromination (equation (2))
and polybromination (equation (3)) reactions, liberating the HBr,
which is continuously recycled on the catalyst surface (equation (1)).
The functionalized bromomethanes are more prone to oxidize
than methane (equation (4)), which leads to COx formation that
predominantly occurs on the catalyst surface.

Improved productivity by optimizing the operating conditions.
Having rationalized the performance of the best catalyst, VPO,
and understood the different pathways of oxybromination, our
next step was to improve the CH3Br selectivity by engineering the
feed compositions and reaction conditions. The partial pressure of
oxygen is critical as it is expected to promote the undesired
oxybromination reactions. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the
present
oxygen
content
is
sufﬁcient
to
attain
high
HBr
conversions (Fig. 5b). Based on our ﬁndings that the gas-phase

an increase of about double the CH3Br productivity and a 10%
increase in its selectivity at 753 K (Fig. 5c). By decreasing the Tbed
to 693 K, the space–time yield (STY) of CH3Br at 10 vol% of CH4
in the inlet feed was similar to that obtained with a 4.5 vol%
methane feed content at a temperature 60 K higher. Importantly,
the selectivity for CH3Br reached 91%, with about 5% and 4%
selectivity for CO and CH2Br2, respectively. An increase in the
total pressure from 1.4 to 1.8 bar led to an increase in the
methane conversion. Nevertheless, the Pareto-like dependence of
the selectivity for CH3Br on CH4 was preserved. To verify further
the applicability of the VPO under realistic reactant-rich feeds, its
performance was evaluated at increasing partial pressures of the
reactants with their molar ratio kept constant (Fig. 5d). The small
alterations
in
the
product
distribution
at
similar
methane
conversions that were observed demonstrate the scalability of the
catalyst performance and, consequentially, a strong enhancement
of the STY of methyl bromide.
Extrapolation to other light alkanes. The applicability of the VPO
catalyst to the functionalization of the other two representative alkane
candidates, ethane and propane, was explored further (Fig. 6). The
onset temperature of the oxybromination reaction decreased in the
order methane > ethane > propane, in line with increase in their
C–H bond strengths40. In the case of methane, a high selectivity for
CH3Br (>92%) can be achieved at low conversions (<7%).
However, a further increase in the conversion, which has a linear
dependence on the temperature, was inevitably coupled with a loss
in the selectivity for CH3Br (vide supra) because of the formation
of CH2Br2 and CO. Likewise, in the oxybromination of ethane,
bromoethane (C2H5Br) was the principal product in the lower
temperature window (83% selectivity, 8% conversion) but, in
contrast to methane, no polybrominated ethanes could be detected
at the reactor outlet. This might be a result of their susceptibility to
cracking
and/or
combustion,
which
could
also
explain
the
equimolar production of CO and CH4 at higher conversions, at
which the polybromination is more favoured. Interestingly, the
selectivity for the latter C1 products slightly decreased at a higher
temperature. Instead, a drop in selectivity for C2H5Br was
progressively compensated with ethylene (C2H4) formation, which
suggests the in situ dehydrobromination of the former, which can
be promoted over phosphate catalysts23. The productivity of C2H4
(67% selectivity, 42% conversion) was higher than that observed in
the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over VPO conducted
under comparable conditions (Supplementary Fig. 6), and those
previously reported for the best-performing VPO systems in
oxidative dehydrogenation41. The rate of double-bond formation in
the case of propane (C3H8) was also higher than that recorded in
the
oxidative
dehydrobromination
performed
under
similar
conditions (Fig. 6). Nevertheless, given the even weaker C–C bonds
in propyl radicals40,42, cracking reactions were more pronounced
than those of ethane, which resulted in C2H5Br being a dominant
product in the lower temperature window, and no bromopropanes
could be detected. Moreover, at higher temperatures, coking was
evident from a substantial deviation in the carbon balance (vide
infra, 10% at 693 K) and visually conﬁrmed by the dark deposits
on the catalyst bed and reactor wall. The results for ethane and
propane suggest that the reaction network is even more complex

Figure 5 | Heterogeneous gas-phase reaction pathways and improvement of the CH3Br productivity by optimizing reaction conditions. a, Methane
conversion (X) and product selectivity (S) versus Tbed in the gas-phase methane bromination follow similar trends as in the oxybromination of methane over
VPO. b, HBr conversion (X) and yields (Y) of bromine and bromocarbons (carbon-based) versus Tbed in the oxybromination of methane over VPO indicate
the bromine consumption in the gas-phase bromination, which ultimately results in a formal decrease of the HBr conversion. c, CH3Br selectivity (S) versus
STY of CH3Br production for two methane concentrations, total pressure and temperature over VPO shows that an excess of methane in the inlet feed is
crucial to reach a high selectivity for CH3Br. d, The single-pass carbon yields of products (Y) and STY of CH3Br versus total reactant concentrations at a
ﬁxed CH4:O2:HBr molar ratio of 4.5:1.5:3 over VPO demonstrate the rather stable product distribution and the scalability of the oxybromination processes
over the VPO catalyst. The experimental error was within ±5%. Other conditions are speciﬁed in Methods.

higher alkanes and the corresponding bromoalkanes to the catalyst
surface. Although challenging in terms of the catalyst and process
design, these results testify to a bright perspective for the
oxybromination approach to functionalize light alkanes.
Conclusions and outlook
Our efforts to design a catalyst that allows a selective one-step
methane functionalization via oxybromination chemistry resulted
in the identiﬁcation of VPO, which provided the highest yields of
the bromomethanes along with negligible CO2 production. The cat-
alyst demonstrated a stable operation over 100 hours on stream,
despite the restructuring of its bulk, which equilibrated within the
ﬁrst 15 hours of the reaction. The outstanding performance of
VPO is rationalized by its high activity in the HBr oxidation and
low propensity to oxidize methane and brominated compounds.
Based on the mechanistic understanding of the reaction that com-
prises synergetic cooperation between the heterogeneous HBr oxi-
dation and the gas-phase methane bromination, the productivity
of CH3Br over a VPO catalyst was enhanced further by optimizing
the reaction conditions, whereby a selectivity for CH3Br of above
90% was attained by increasing the feed partial pressure of
methane. The oxybromination of ethane and propane over VPO
indicated a more-complex reaction network that comprised dehy-
drobromination and cracking of the brominated compounds. In
the case of ethane, high yields of ethylene could be achieved with
only marginal CO2 formation. These ﬁndings constitute an impor-
tant step and provide a comprehensive background for the design of
an efﬁcient process to valorize the abundant and readily available
natural-gas reserves.
Methods
Catalyst preparation. TiO2 (Aldrich, rutile nanopowder, 99.5%) and Cu3(PO4)2
(ABCR, 98%), RuO2 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.9%) and CeO2 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.9%) were
calcined at 823, 723 and 1,173 K, respectively, in static air with a heating rate of
5 K min−1 for ﬁve hours. VPO was prepared via an organic route22. A suspension of
V2O5 (15 g; Aldrich, ≥99.6%) in isobutanol (90 cm3; Acros, >99%) and benzyl
alcohol (60 cm3; Sigma Aldrich, >99%) was reﬂuxed for three hours. After cooling to
room temperature, H3PO4 (Sigma Aldrich, ≥85%) was added to set the molar P/V
ratio to 1.2 and the mixture was then reﬂuxed for another 16 hours. The resulting
slurry was separated by ﬁltration, washed with isobutanol and methanol (Fluka,
≥99.9%), dried in vacuum (50 mbar) at 373 K for 16 hours and ﬁnally activated in
ﬂowing air (100 cm3 STP min−1) at 823 K (heated at 5 K min−1) for ﬁve hours.
FePO4 was prepared by mixing the Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (13.38 g; Sigma Aldrich, ≥98%)
and (NH4)H2PO4 (3.81 g; Acros, >99%) in deionized water for two hours, then
dried in vacuum (50 mbar) at 363 K for 16 hours and calcined in ﬂowing air
(100 cm3 STP min−1) at 873 K (5 K min−1) for ﬁve hours. CrPO4 was synthesized by
mixing aqueous CrCl3·6H2O (0.09 M, 1 dm3; Aldrich, ≥98%) and KH2PO4 (0.09 M,
1 dm3; Fluka, ≥99.5%) in deionized water with NaCH3COO·3H2O (0.1 M; Acros,
>99%) for six hours. The precipitate was recovered by ﬁltration, washed with water,
dried in vacuum (50 mbar) at 363 K for three hours and ﬁnally calcined in
ﬂowing air (100 cm3 STP min−1) at 1,273 K (20 K min−1) for three hours. The
preparation of the other metal phosphates, CePO4, LaPO4, TiP2O7, Mn3(PO4)2,
CoPO4, Ni3(PO4)2, and Zn3(PO4)2, studied in this work is provided in the
Supplementary Information.
Catalyst characterization. Powder XRD measurements were carried out with a
PANalytical XʹPert PRO-MPD diffractometer. Data were recorded in the 10–70° 2θ
range with an angular step size of 0.017° and a counting time of 0.26 seconds per
step. N2 sorption at 77 K was performed using a Quantachrome Quadrosorb-SI
analyser. Prior to the measurement, the solid was evacuated to 50 mbar at 573 K
for 12 hours. H2-TPR was measured using a Micromeritics Autochem 2920 unit.
The sieved sample (40 mg) was loaded into a U-shaped quartz microreactor and
pretreated in He (20 cm3 STP min−1) at 473 K for 30 minutes. The analysis was
carried out in 5 vol% H2/Ar (20 cm3 STP min−1), ramping the temperature from 473
to 1,203 K at 10 K min−1. The 31P MAS NMR spectra were recorded at a spinning
speed of 80 kHz by using a Bruker Avance 400 NMR spectrometer at 400 MHz and
9.4 T. The spectra were recorded by using 512 accumulations at pulses of eight
milliseconds and a relaxation time of one second, with 85% H3PO4 as a reference.
HRTEM measurements were performed using a FEI Tecnai F30 ST microscope
(ﬁeld emission gun, operated at 300 kV).
Catalyst testing. The oxybromination of alkanes was performed in a home-made
continuous-ﬂow microreactor (see Supplementary Fig. 1). The catalyst (Wcat = 1 g,
particle size dP = 0.4–0.6 mm) was loaded into a quartz tube (16 mm internal
diameter) over a plug of quartz wool and pretreated in a He ﬂow for 30 minutes prior
to the reaction. Unless otherwise stated, steady-state tests were conducted at a total
pressure (P) of 1.4 bar in a Tbed range of 673–773 K using a total ﬂow (FT) of 100 cm3
STP min−1 that consisted of 4.5 vol% methane, ethane or propane (Messer, 20% in
He), 1.5 vol% O2 (PanGas, 5% in He), 3 vol% HBr (Messer, 2.3 anhydrous) and
3 vol% Ar (PanGas, purity 5.0) balanced in He (PanGas, purity 5.0). In combustion
tests, CH3Br, synthesized in the laboratory, was supplied by a mass-ﬂow controller
and CH2Br2 (ABCR, 99%) was fed with a syringe pump into a home-made
evaporator using the feed gas (mixture of O2, He and Ar, 100 cm3 STP min−1) as the
carrier. The bromination of methane was performed over a bed of quartz particles

Figure 6 | The performance of VPO in the oxybromination of methane,
ethane and propane. The alkane conversion (X) as a function of the Tbed
shows that the temperature onset of the oxybromination reaction
decreases in the order methane > ethane > propane, which is in line with a
decrease in the C–H bond strength. Bromoethane (C2H5Br) is the principal
product observed in the oxybromination of ethane at low reaction
temperatures but, in contrast to methane, no polybromoethanes are
observed, probably because of their higher propensity to cracking. At higher
temperatures, the dehydrobromination pathway is opened, which results in
signiﬁcant ethylene (C2H4) production, with negligible selectivity (S) for
CO2. Differently, propane oxybromination causes signiﬁcant cracking and
coking, probably because of the activation of propane on the catalyst
surface. The experimental error was within ±5%. Other conditions are stated
in Methods.

(particle size dP = 0.4–0.6 mm) at 1.55 bar using a feed that contained 4.5 vol% CH4,
1.5 vol% Br2 (Acros, >99.8%), 0 or 1.5 vol% O2 and 3 vol% Ar balanced in He.
Liquid Br2 was supplied by means of a syringe pump and evaporated directly into the
remaining gas mixture in a home-made evaporator. The efﬂuent gas stream was
analysed after one hour of stabilization under each reaction condition. The Br2 content
was determined off-line by iodometric titration using a Mettler Toledo G20 Compact
Titrator. The amount of the carbon-containing products (methane, ethane, propane,
ethylene, propylene, their brominated derivatives and CO and CO2) and HBr in the
efﬂuent gas was determined on-line with a gas chromatograph equipped with a
GS-CarbonPLOT column (113–3133) coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS,
Agilent GC 6890, MS 5973N). The HBr oxidation was performed in a continuous-ﬂow
set-up as described elsewhere13. Further experimental details with respect to the
product analyses are given in the Supplementary Information.
