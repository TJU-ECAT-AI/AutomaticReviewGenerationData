Impact of K and Ba promoters on CO2 hydrogenation
over Cu/Al2O3 catalysts at high pressure†
Atul Bansode,a Bruno Tidona,b Philipp Rudolf von Rohrb and Atsushi Urakawa*a
CO2 hydrogenation over K and Ba promoted Cu/Al2O3 catalyst was systematically investigated to study the
promoter eﬀects in a wide range of pressure conditions. The catalysts prepared by the impregnation method
were characterized by XRD, physisorption, N2O-pulse chemisorption, H2-TPR, and CO2-TPD techniques. The
catalytic performance was evaluated using a fixed-bed microreactor for a pressure and temperature range of
0.40–36 MPa and 443–553 K. The influence of promoters on the formation of surface species present during
the reaction was examined by in situ DRIFTS. As expected from thermodynamics, high pressure and low
temperature are the favourable conditions to achieve high selectivity to methanol over the Cu/Al2O3
catalyst. Improved reaction performance towards methanol synthesis and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS)
reaction was observed for the Ba and K promoted Cu/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively. Notably, with the
Ba promotion the selectivity to methanol was enhanced to 62.2% compared to 46.6% of the unpromoted
Cu/Al2O3 catalyst at 10 MPa and 473 K at the expense of a lowered CO2 conversion. In contrast, the K
promoted catalyst exhibited high selectivity to CO (95.8%) under the same reaction conditions. Formation of
dimethyl ether, significant over the unpromoted Cu/Al2O3 catalyst at 0.4–10 MPa, was strongly suppressed at
36 MPa. Ba and K promoters effectively suppressed the formation of dimethyl ether under all examined
pressure conditions by weakening the acidity of the alumina support. The strong promotional effects of K
was explained by the predominant coverage of both Cu and alumina surface sites, creating specific active
sites stabilizing surface intermediate species and preferring the RWGS pathway. On the contrary, the Ba
promoter covers the alumina surface exclusively and renders Cu accessible and more easily reducible,
promoting methanol synthesis. The effects of promoters on the catalytic performance were found to be
valid at low and at elevated pressures.
Introduction
There is a worldwide need to address the problem of global warming
caused by the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere
and to find sustainable solutions for this problem. It is also a
demand of time to harness the utilisation of carbon which is ‘‘lost’’
in CO2 molecules from burning fossil fuels, causing both CO2
release into the atmosphere and depletion of fossil fuels. One of
the promising approaches to mitigate and solve this problem is to
recycle CO2 from the atmosphere and from the processes where CO2
is generated such as power and chemical plants and convert it into
valuable chemicals and fuels. Conversion of CO2 by means of
catalytic hydrogenation has attracted considerable attention as one
of the key processes for CO2 fixation and as recycling of carbon
source emitted as CO2.1 Numerous research works have been
reported on converting CO2 into basic chemicals such as methanol,
hydrocarbons, esters, and ethers by means of CO2 hydrogenation.2–4
Methanol synthesis holds a key position in CO2 hydrogenation,
because methanol can be used as a starting feedstock in the
chemical industries and as an alternative to fossil fuel (e.g. methanol
fuel cells). Therefore, great eﬀorts have been made to discover
highly active and selective catalysts for methanol synthesis.
Supported Cu and Zn based catalysts and the nature of the active
site have been extensively studied in the presence or absence of
various promoters such as Zr, Si, Al, B, Cr, Ce, Ga, V, and Ti.1–6
Commercially used Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts achieve high selectivity
to methanol with good methanol yield after careful optimization
of separation, recycling, and coupling of reactors. Along with
improved activity, catalyst stability is also an important issue in
terms of the economic life time of a catalyst.7
Among others, there are two important competitive reactions
in CO2 hydrogenation. The first one is methanol synthesis

(RWGS) reaction (reaction (2)).7 There is also a possibility that
CO formed in reaction (2) undergoes further hydrogenation to
give methanol (reaction (3)).

Despite existing controversies about the reaction pathways,
i.e. methanol formation via CO or CO2 hydrogenation, isotope
labelling study by Chinchen et al. suggested that CO2 is the
main carbon source in methanol from the CO/CO2 hydrogena-
tion reaction over the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst.8 Further recent
modelling studies by Grabow and Mavrikakis showed that on
Cu both CO and CO2 hydrogenation pathways are active under
typical methanol synthesis conditions.9 Besides catalyst composi-
tion and active site structure, parameters like temperature, pressure,
and space velocity play important roles in determining the perfor-
mance of the reaction.10 Methanol synthesis is an exothermic
reaction with reduction in the total molecule number. Thus, low
temperature and high pressure favour the reaction based on
thermodynamic analysis.11,12 In most reports, the reaction was
tested from ambient pressure up to 10 MPa, except a few.10,13,14
The area of CO2 hydrogenation above 25 MPa remains largely
unexplored due to expensive equipments and safety precautions,
despite obvious advantages of the reaction. Generally, high pressure
processes are regarded more energy consuming compared to low
pressure ones; however they can oﬀer new opportunities to reduce
the required energy and cost for production while attaining high
yield of products from CO2 reduction, possibly benefitted from the
enhanced performance of the reaction and also from the reactor size
reduction keeping the same or even better productivity.
This work presents CO2 hydrogenation over Cu/Al2O3 catalysts
promoted with K and Ba in a continuous fixed-bed microreaction
system at pressures up to 36 MPa. The choice of the promoters is
due to its high aﬃnity with CO2, forming carbonates which can be
decomposed under mild conditions.15–17 The high aﬃnity to CO2
and the low stability of the resulting carbonates under a reducing
atmosphere may oﬀer great advantages to enhance the reaction
rate and alter selectivity. Indeed, K promotion has been reported
to enhance the RWGS selectivity.18 A study on Cu/ZnO/Al2O3
catalysts promoted with some metal components including Ba
has been reported for CO/CO2 hydrogenation.19,20 However, to the
best of our knowledge, the promoter eﬀects given solely by Ba
and also for Cu/Al2O3 catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation have not
been reported. Furthermore, a small-scale microreactor was
used in this study. Advantages of microreactors are improved
heat and mass transfer,21–23 increased space-time yield,24
increased reaction selectivity control,25 and most importantly
the ability to handle dangerous chemicals more safely, thanks
to the reduction in reactor volume. This is particularly true for high
pressure conditions involving flammable gases such as hydrogen.
In this work, we investigate the eﬀects of high pressure and the
promoters on the catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation. The
catalysts are characterized by XRD, H2 temperature programmed
reduction (H2-TPR), BET surface area, N2O pulse chemisorption,
CO2 temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD), and
in situ diﬀuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectro-
scopy (DRIFTS) to explain possible origins of the diﬀerences in
the catalytic performance.
Experimental section
Catalyst preparation
Cu/Al2O3 (18/82 wt%) catalyst was prepared by the incipient wet-
ness impregnation method using copper nitrate hexahydrate
(>98%, Alfa Aesar) and g-Al2O3 (Bimodal, Alfa Aesar). It was dried
overnight in an oven at 373 K and subsequently calcined in air at
673 K for 4 h. Further, it was divided into three parts. The two parts
were impregnated with barium acetate (>99%, Sigma Aldrich) or
potassium carbonate (>99%, Acros) to obtain Cu–Ba/Al2O3 (5 wt%
Ba/95 wt% Cu/Al2O3) or Cu–K/Al2O3 (5 wt% K/95 wt% Cu/Al2O3),
respectively. The K and Ba promoted catalysts were dried overnight
at 373 K and calcined in air at 673 K for 4 h.
Catalyst characterization
XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance
diﬀractometer equipped with a Cu tube, a Ge (1 1 1) incident
beam monochromator (l = 0.1541 nm), and a Vantec-1 PSD
operated in transmission mode. Data were recorded in the range
of 5–701 2y with a step size of 0.021 and a counting time of 4 s per
step. The crystallite sizes of CuO, Cu, and BaCO3 mentioned in
Table 1 were estimated from the full width at half maximum
(FWHM) of corresponding peaks using the Scherrer equation with
the shape factor of 0.9 assuming the spherical particles.26 (2 0 2)
reflection for CuO, (111) reflection for Cu, and (111) reflection for
BaCO3 were used to determine the crystallite size.
N2 isotherms at 77 K were measured on a Quantachrome
Autosorb 1-MP analyzer. Prior to analysis, the samples were
degassed in vacuum at 573 K for 12 h.
H2-TPR of the as-prepared catalysts (20 mg) was carried out
on a Thermo TPDRO 1100 equipped with a TCD detector. The
samples were previously treated at 373 K for 1 h under N2
stream, and subsequently heated from 323 to 903 K at the rate
of 10 K min1 under a stream of 5% H2 in N2 at 20 ml min1.

A soda lime (CaO + Na2O) trap was used to adsorb mainly H2O
and CO2.
For CO2-TPD, the catalyst samples (20 mg) were firstly
reduced in 5% H2 in N2 at 20 ml min1 for 2 h at 603 K,
followed by exposure to CO2 at 323 K for 1 h at 20 ml min1.
TPD was performed under H2 flow at 20 ml min1 to study the
stability of adsorbed CO2 under a reducing environment as in
CO2 hydrogenation. The temperature was increased from 323 to
903 K at the rate of 10 K min1 and maintained at 903 K. The
eﬄuent gases were analysed on a mass spectrometer (MS),
Pfeifer Omnistar GSD 301 C, without any trap.
The copper surface area and dispersion were measured
using the nitrous oxide pulse chemisorption method reported
by Evans et al.27 Prior to analysis, samples were reduced in 5%
H2 in He stream at 603 K, followed by cooling to 363 K under He
flow. A known volume of N2O was then injected as pulse by
using a six port valve. The N2O at the exit was trapped in liquid
N2 and the evolved N2 was measured on the calibrated mass
spectrometer, Pfeifer Omnistar GSD 301 C. Copper metal surface
areas were calculated assuming 1.46  1019 copper atoms per m2.27
Though Ba and K components are known to promote N2O decom-
position, they are active only above 473 K hence no interference was
assumed in this analysis from Ba and K on the N2O decomposition
and thus on the derived Cu surface area.28–30
In situ DRIFTS measurements were performed using a reac-
tion chamber (HVC-DRP, Harrick) mounted in a Praying Mantis
(Harrick) DRIFTS optical system. The spectra were collected
using a Bruker Vertex70v FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a
liquid-nitrogen-cooled MCT detector at 4 cm1 resolution.
About 50 mg of the sample was loaded in the cell for each
measurement. The flow of gases was controlled by means of
mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst). The gases pass through
the sample (catalyst) packed-bed, mimicking the plug-flow
condition of the reaction. Prior to the measurements, sample
powders were reduced in situ at 573 K in H2 stream (9 ml min1
H2 and 3 ml min1 He) for 1.5 h. Subsequently, the system was
cooled to 443 K in the H2 stream and then to the reactant
mixture (H2 : CO2 = 3 : 1, total flow 12 ml min1) until the
signal in DRIFTS was stabilized. The spectra were recorded
every 30 seconds to follow the reaction and stabilization
process of the catalysts and the evolution of surface species.
In situ DRIFTS study was carried out at the lowest examined
temperature of the catalytic testing (443 K) where the level of
product formation was low and in some cases it was close to the
detection limit of the gas chromatography (GC) instrument
used in catalytic testing. However, this temperature was chosen
because the diﬀerences in the product selectivity were more
prominent at lower temperatures and thus the surface species
which are not stable at high temperatures can be more clearly
observed.
Catalytic testing
The performance of the three catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation was
studied using a fixed-bed microreaction system. A tubular reactor
(ID: 1.74 mm, OD: 3.17 mm) was used. Before charging the
catalysts to the reactor, they were pelletized, crushed and sieved
to a size of 100–300 mm. 170 mg of catalyst was loaded in the
reactor (the bed length of ca. 10 cm) and reduced in the stream of
Ar (10%) and H2 (90%) at 603 K for 2 h at atmospheric pressure.
After the prereduction, the catalyst bed was cooled down to room
temperature. The reaction mixture was then introduced into the
reactor at a flow rate of 30 Nml min1 (11 ml min1 liquid CO2
(293 K) or 6 Nml min1 CO2 and 24 Nml min1 H2) at GHSV of
4000 h1. For the reactions below the critical pressure of CO2, a
thermal mass flow controller was used to feed gaseous CO2, while
above the critical pressure a liquid CO2 syringe pump (Isco
Teledyne 260D) was used to feed liquefied CO2. A high pressure
thermal mass flow controller (Bronkhorst) was used to maintain
the constant flow of the H2–Ar mixture. The pressure in the reactor
was regulated by an automatic back-pressure regulator (Jasco, BP
2080 plus). The reactor system is similar to that reported by
Trachsel et al.31 except for the H2 compressor (Haskel AG75),
reservoir, and two pressure regulators (GO regulator PR57 and
TESCOM 44-1100) to remove the pressure fluctuations, installed
before the H2 mass flow controller. The reaction was carried out
under four diﬀerent pressure conditions of 0.40, 3, 10 and 36 MPa.
For every new pressure condition, as-prepared catalyst was charged
to the reactor and tested at diﬀerent temperatures between 443
and 553 K. The data points were collected during the steady state
operation of the reaction at specified temperature, pressure and
flow conditions. No obvious catalyst deactivation was observed
during the data collection throughout the catalyst testing. The feed
mixture was composed of CO2 (20%), H2 (72.5%) and Ar (7.5%) as
an internal standard for GC analysis. The eﬄuent stream was
analyzed by an on-line GC instrument (Bruker 450) equipped with
a Porapak Q+ Mol sieve column and a TCD detector for analysis of
gaseous products, and with a CP wax 52 CB capillary column and a
FID detector for analysis of methanol and other oxygenates. The
product transfer line from the reactor to GC was heated to 423 K to
avoid condensation of products.
CO2 conversion was determined directly from the CO2
concentration measured by the TCD detector. The maximum
standard deviation of CO2 in the reaction feed was 0.5% of the
measured value. This is critical when CO2 conversion is below 1%.
In these cases, CO2 conversion was calculated from the carbon
balance, based on the product concentrations for which the
sensitivity, thus the accuracy, is higher. The detection limits for
methanol and CO were 10 and 200 ppm, respectively, based on the
S/N of the chromatograms. This ensures accuracy of CO2 conver-
sion, better than 0.1%. The conversion and selectivity values were
calculated by averaging over several injections after product con-
centrations were stabilized. The tendency and accuracy of the
catalytic performance were ensured by a minimum of two runs
carried out on diﬀerent days. The standard deviations for CO2
conversion and product selectivities were o2.2%.

Besides minor reflections due to the g-Al2O3 support, a very
minor peak due to BaCO3 was observed for Cu–Ba/Al2O3.
In contrast, no reflections due to K2CO3 were observed for
Cu–K/Al2O3. Both barium and potassium are expected to exist
as respective carbonates based on the used precursor and
calcination in air. The absence or minor presence of reflections
in XRD indicates that K and Ba carbonates exist in a highly
dispersed form such as nano-crystallites or thin layers. There
was no change in the crystallite size of CuO in the three
catalysts (Table 1).
Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the three catalysts after CO2
hydrogenation at 36 MPa (the catalysts tested under diﬀerent
pressure conditions show similar XRD patterns). Clearly, copper
in the three catalysts exists in a metallic form as confirmed
by JCPDS data 4-0836. Even after prolonged exposure to air
(10 days), the patterns remained unaltered and copper stayed
metallic, indicating full reduction of CuO to metallic Cu and
possible sintering during the activation and reaction. The main
diﬀerence between the three patterns was the presence of
BaCO3 in Cu–Ba/Al2O3, more pronounced than in the as-prepared
catalyst (Fig. 1). The crystallite size of BaCO3 in as-prepared
and used Cu–Ba/Al2O3 was estimated to be 7.7 and 12.3 nm,
respectively. This implies that the barium particles agglo-
merated and/or sintered during the reaction, although the
crystallite size remained very small. Interestingly, the reflections
due to K2CO3 were not observed even after the reaction, indicating
that the K component remained in a highly dispersed state
during the reaction.
Textural properties
Table 1 summarizes the results obtained by the physisorption
analysis along with the specific copper surface area (SCu) of the
three catalysts. After the loading of copper on alumina the BET
surface area was reduced from 247 to 184 m2 g1. There was
significant reduction in the average pore volume of Cu/Al2O3
compared to that of Al2O3, indicating the pore filing by the
copper component. After the potassium promotion to Cu/Al2O3,
no remarkable change in the BET surface area was observed. In
the report by Levy and Bauer, the increase in the surface area of
potassium doped alumina was observed up to 0.03 ion ratio of
K/Al, and above 0.03 up to 0.07 of K/Al the surface area
decreased close to that of alumina.32 The K/Al ion ratio of our
study was 0.064 and negligible change in the BET surface area may
have the same origin. Further to this observation, Kantschewa et al.
reported a strong interaction of potassium with alumina by
forming AlOK groups and that some potassium even penetrates
into subsurface layers, reducing the surface concentration of
potassium.33
In contrast to the BET surface area, a strong decrease in the
copper surface area, i.e. from 2.25 to 0.74 m2 g1, was observed
upon K promotion. As reported by Chen et al.,18 it can be due to
the homogeneous coverage of copper particles by the potas-
sium component, explaining the similar BET surface area of
Cu–K/Al2O3 to that of Cu/Al2O3. This highly dispersed form of
the K component also explains the low crystallinity of K2CO3 in
the Cu–K/Al2O3 XRD pattern reported above. On the other hand,
the addition of the barium component resulted in a further
decrease in the BET surface area of Cu/Al2O3. It is interesting
that a higher copper metal area was observed upon Ba promotion
compared to that of Cu/Al2O3. The decrease in the BET surface
area indicates partial coverage of the barium component on the
alumina surface and preventing the agglomeration of copper
particles, thus possibly enhancing the specific copper surface
area. Furthermore, a negligible influence on the pore volume
was found by K and Ba promotion.
H2-TPR
The reducibility of Cu in the three catalysts was studied by
H2-TPR and the profiles are presented in Fig. 3. Two clear peaks
were observed for Cu/Al2O3 (profile (a)). They were ascribed to

the reduction of the highly dispersed CuO species, occurring
at a lower temperature, and of the bulk-like CuO phases,
occurring at a higher temperature,34 denoted b and g peaks,
respectively. K promotion did not alter the general profile thus
the reducibility of the Cu component (profile (b)). It slightly
increased the stability of CuO by 21 and 20 K for b and g peaks,
respectively.
Interestingly, Ba promotion resulted in a completely diﬀerent
H2-TPR profile. Deconvolution obtained by Gaussian functions
clarifies that the profile is comprised of three peaks (profile (c)).
There was no change in the reduction temperature of highly
dispersed CuO (b peak), but the amount of hydrogen uptake to
reduce this copper species decreased significantly in comparison
to Cu/Al2O3. On the other hand, the position of the g peak shifted
to a much lower temperature, indicating that Ba promotion
facilitates the reduction of bulk copper species. Also, an additional
reduction peak, denoted g1, was observed and the reduction
temperature was very close to that of the g peak.
In summary, barium promotion facilitates CuO reduction
and all the copper species are reduced at the same temperature
within a narrow temperature window. The origin of the drastic
change in the H2-TPR profile of Cu–Ba/Al2O3 remains unclear,
but it may be related to the melting of Ba species under this
reduction condition where water is also formed.16 This wetted
barium hydroxide like species may promote Cu reduction.
CO2-TPD
In addition to modifying the surface sites of the Cu and Al2O3
surfaces, K and Ba may function as CO2-capturing components
during the reaction because of the high activity of their oxides
and hydroxides with CO2 to form the respective carbonates. On
the other hand, inorganic carbonates are typically stable and a
high temperature is required for decomposition (decomposition
temperature of K2CO3 and BaCO3 is ca. 1160 and 1620 K,
respectively35,36), although nano-crystallites of these carbonates
show significantly lower decomposition temperatures.16,37 In this
study, we adapted the impregnation method and precursors so
that a low decomposition temperature could be obtained.16
Also, it has been reported that formate species dominate over
the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst surface in the reaction gas mixture of CO2
and H2 at elevated temperatures38 and formate species may be
formed during the CO2-TPD of this study. In order to under-
stand the stability of CO2 adsorbed and stored as carbonates
and/or formates, CO2-TPD study was performed after pre-
reduction of the catalysts to render K and Ba components in
their oxide form before CO2 adsorption (their decomposition
was confirmed by MS). CO2 desorption was studied under a H2
atmosphere in order to study the stabilities of such adsorbed
and carbonate/formate species under a reductive environment
as in the target reaction. Fig. 4 shows the CO2-TPD profiles in
the presence of hydrogen. CO2 desorption on Cu/Al2O3 shows a
single peak at 375 K denoted peak (I). Bo
¨nicke et al. studied
CO2-TPD on a stepped copper (332) surface and showed a
desorption peak of CO2 at 376 K.39 Further, Chen et al. reported
that the CO2 desorbed at 375 K could originate from the
decomposition of formate species formed in the presence of
H2 on the surface of copper.18
The amount of CO2 desorbed was significantly higher for the
K and Ba promoted copper catalyst, implying that K and Ba
promotion provides an additional active site to enhance the
concentration of the surface formate and/or carbonate species.
The amount of the CO2 desorption peak (I) was significantly
increased after the addition of K and Ba promoters, indicating
that the number of CO2 adsorption sites was increased as
compared to the unpromoted catalyst. In the case of the K
promoted catalyst, peak (I) at 376 K shifted to 388 K, and two
additional peaks at 458 (II) and 723 K (III) were observed.
Jørgensen et al. also observed peaks (II) and (III) on K/Cu(110)
at a high coverage of potassium on copper.37 The density of the
adsorption site for peak (III) was correlated to the coverage of K
adatoms.37 These peaks were ascribed to two diﬀerent surface
carbonate species desorbing above 450 K. Here, as evident from

the BET surface area and copper metal surface area, potassium
components cover the copper particles and likely create adsorp-
tion sites similar to those on the K–Cu interface, in addition to
the sites available on the alumina surface. On the other hand,
the Ba promoted catalyst showed the identical position of peak
(I), while a prominent peak (II) was observed at 453 K and
no peak (III) was detected. Assuming that peak (I) originates
from the decomposition of surface formates and peaks (II) and
(III) from that of surface carbonates, the profile indicates the
presence of only one type of carbonate species on Cu–Ba/Al2O3.
Peak (II) can be attributed to the carbonate on a specific surface
site formed by Cu and Ba interactions, similar to the case of
Cu–K/Al2O3. Based on the high accessibility of the Cu surface in
Cu–Ba/Al2O3 (Table 1), the barium components predominantly
cover the alumina surface and not the copper surface. Impor-
tantly, the major desorption peaks (I) and (II) fall well within
the temperature range at which the reaction was carried out,
suggesting the high reactivity of CO2 captured as surface carbonate
and formate species and that the adsorption site corresponding
to these peaks may play crucial roles in determining the
catalytic performance.

Unpromoted Cu/Al2O3. First, the catalytic performance of
the unpromoted Cu/Al2O3 catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation was
evaluated. Fig. 5 shows the CO2 conversion obtained under diﬀer-
ent temperature (443–553 K) and pressure (0.4–36 MPa) conditions.
Large impacts of reaction pressure and temperature on the catalytic
performance were evidenced. High CO2 conversion was observed
at higher pressures and particularly at higher temperatures. The
maximum CO2 conversion attained was 29.6% at 36 MPa at
553 K. Carbon monoxide, methanol, methyl formate, and
dimethyl ether were the products detected.
Fig. 6 shows the influence of pressure and temperature on
methanol selectivity. At high pressures (>3 MPa), methanol
selectivity was higher at lower temperatures. The rise in pressure
resulted in an increase in CO2 conversion, as seen from Fig. 5,
while retaining a similar level of methanol selectivity, thus
enhancing methanol productivity at low temperatures. Inter-
estingly, with the increase in the reaction temperature metha-
nol yield increased and reached a plateau at 0.40 and 3 MPa
(Table S1, ESI†). In contrast, it decreased at 10 and 36 MPa
because of enhanced catalytic activity towards RWGS above
503 K. The comparison at 473 K showed over 7-fold increase in
methanol yield when the reaction pressure was increased from
3 to 36 MPa. The highest methanol yield of 103.4 mg gcat
1 h1
was achieved at 473 K and 36 MPa. Among the data above the
confident accuracy for CO2 quantification and the detection
limit of the products (the cases where CO2 conversions were >
1%), the highest methanol selectivity was 69.5% at 36 MPa with
a good methanol yield of 75.0 mg gcat
1 h1 at the lowest
examined temperature of 443 K.
The CO selectivity was greatly increased at higher tempera-
tures as expected from thermodynamics because of the
endothermic nature of the RWGS reaction. As the reaction
temperature was increased from 443 to 553 K, roughly 15-,
71-, 146-, and 28-fold increases in CO productivity were
observed at 0.4, 3, 10, and 36 MPa, respectively (Table S1, ESI†).
Pressure had an impact on the RWGS reaction activity, but its
influence was minor compared to that of temperature as
expected from the thermodynamic calculation.12 The highest
CO yield of 718.2 mg gcat
1 h1 was observed at 553 K and
36 MPa with a high CO selectivity of 91.7%.
The formation of dimethyl ether was significant, in some cases
with its selectivity and yield exceeding those of methanol (at 533,
553 K at 3, 10 MPa). The formation of dimethyl ether was more
significant above 473 K. The highest yield of 130.9 mg gcat
1 h1 was
observed at 553 K and 10 MPa. (Table S1, ESI†).
Trace amount of methyl formate was also observed at 3 MPa
which was completely absent at 0.4 MPa. A further rise in pressure
increased methyl formate selectivity, with a maximum of 3.1% at
36 MPa and 443 K. Above 533 K the formation of methyl formate
was found to be suppressed.

Potassium and barium promoted Cu/Al2O3. CO2 hydrogenation
over the K and Ba promoted Cu/Al2O3 catalysts was tested under
identical conditions as above. Fig. 7 depicts CO selectivity observed
for the Cu–K/Al2O3 catalyst under various conditions of pressure
and temperature. In agreement with the literature,38 addition of K
eﬀectively suppressed the formation of methanol and promoted
CO formation. The RWGS reaction was very selective; the selectivity
to CO was always higher than 95.0% above 503 K at all investigated
pressures (Fig. 7). Although the level of CO2 conversion was very
close to that observed for Cu/Al2O3 (Table S2, ESI†), it is remark-
able to observe 94.8% CO selectivity under the condition (443 K,
10 MPa) where the highest methanol selectivity of 80.0% was
achieved for Cu/Al2O3 (Fig. 6), inverting the selectivity between the
two main reactions. The selectivity to methanol for Cu–K/Al2O3
was always lower than that of Cu/Al2O3 except one condition at the
lowest temperature and pressure (443 K, 0.4 MPa) where the
methanol selectivity was 29.8% and the value is less accurate
due to the very low CO2 conversion (Table S2, ESI†). K promotion
fully suppressed the formation of dimethyl ether (Fig. 9) and
methyl formate (Table S2, ESI†), whose formations were detected
for Cu/Al2O3, and CO and methanol were the only products
detected under the investigated conditions.
In contrast, Ba promotion positively aﬀected methanol
selectivity particularly at low temperatures (Table S3, ESI†).
Fig. 8 compares the methanol selectivities for the unpromoted
and the K and Ba promoted Cu/Al2O3 catalysts at 473 K at
diﬀerent pressures, highlighting the promoter eﬀects of Ba in
methanol synthesis and those of K in RWGS. Similar to K, the
promotional eﬀect of Ba was valid (ca. 20% increase in methanol
selectivity compared to the unpromoted catalyst) at all examined
pressures and more notable at lower temperatures (Fig. 8,
Tables S1 and S3, ESI†). The increased methanol selectivity of
the Ba promoted catalyst was accompanied by a slight reduction in
CO2 conversion as compared to the unpromoted and K promoted
catalysts. The slight decrease in methanol selectivity above 10 MPa
can be explained by the formation of methyl formate, whose
formation was appreciable for the unpromoted and Ba promoted
catalysts (Tables S1 and S3, ESI†). Methyl formate with a selectivity
of 10.3% was observed at 36 MPa and 443 K.
Yu et al. reported that methanol can react with formate
species adsorbed on catalyst surfaces to produce methyl formate
by the transesterification reaction.40 Alternatively, dehydrogena-
tion of methanol can lead to the formation of methyl formate as
in reaction (4)
2CH3OH - HCOOCH3 + 2H2
(4)
A study by Tonner et al. showed that RANEY
s copper, consisting
of porous copper with a small amount of residual high surface area
alumina, was active for dehydrogenation of methanol to methyl
formate.41 Under our reaction conditions, both pathways are
possible to form methyl formate, although our high pressure
condition of 36 MPa likely promoted the formation of surface
formate intermediates to promote the former reaction. Also the
absence of methyl formate at the lowest examined pressure
supports that this would be the most probable pathway. More-
over, the dehydrogenation reaction (4) may not be favoured due
to the high concentration of H2 in the reaction.
Moreover, both promoters eﬃciently suppressed the formation
of dimethyl ether which was produced for the unpromoted catalyst
(Fig. 9) in some cases in a greater yield than methanol. Dimethyl
ether formation is assumed to occur via dehydration of methanol.
An increase in the residence time at higher pressures due to the
constant GHSV of this work may have promoted the conversion of
methanol to dimethyl ether for the unpromoted catalyst. This was
evidenced by the results at 0.40, 3, and 10 MPa (Table S1, ESI†).
Interestingly, at 36 MPa the formation of dimethyl ether was found
to be reduced at all examined temperatures.
In situ DRIFTS study
Surface species present during the reaction on the unpromoted
and promoted Cu catalysts were investigated by in situ DRIFTS
to clarify the influence of the promoters on the formation of
specific surface species and thus the catalytic performance.

Fig. 10 compares the DRIFT spectra of the surface species
formed on the bare support (g-Al2O3) and on the Cu/Al2O3
catalyst in the reaction mixture (H2 : CO2 = 3 : 1) at the lowest
temperature examined in this study (443 K). This temperature
condition was chosen because the promoter eﬀects were most
prominently observed. Although the examined pressure was
atmospheric, similar promoter eﬀects as under high pressure
conditions of this study were assumed.
Fig. 10(a) shows the DRIFT spectra obtained for the g-Al2O3
support. There was no change in the spectral features and only
the absorbance of the bands increased with time. The promi-
nent bands formed at 1653, 1435 and 1228 cm1 are assigned to
surface bicarbonates.42–44 The bicarbonate species dominates
the surface of alumina under the reaction conditions in the
absence of metal components. The minor bands at 1472 and
1389 cm1 can be assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric
OCO stretching frequencies of a monodentate carbonate.45–47
As reported by Bando et al., the formation of carboxylate species
was indicated by the broad bands at 1560 and 1360 cm1.42
Absence of bands in the CH stretching region rules out the
formation of surface formate species on g-Al2O3.
Surface species drastically changed when Cu was present on
the surface of g-Al2O3. Fig. 5(b–d) shows the evolution of sur-
face species during the reaction over Cu/Al2O3. Initially, rapid
formation of bicarbonate species was observed (Fig. 10(b)),
most likely on the alumina surface. As the bicarbonate bands
gained intensity further, the formation of bidentate formates on
Cu was evidenced by the bands at 2930, 2850, and 1350 cm1.48
For the bidentate formates on Cu, an additional band at
ca. 1580 cm1 is expected, but this was not firmly confirmed
due to the broader nature of the band with less intensity
compared to the band at 1350 cm1.48 The sharp bands at
1597, 1394, and 1377 cm1 can be assigned to formates
on alumina.49 Also, the positions of the bands in the C–H
stretching region (2999, 2890, and 2743 cm1) are identical to
those observed when formic acid is adsorbed and evacuated at
473 K on alumina.42 Therefore, we assign these bands to
formate species on the alumina surface. At the steady state
(Fig. 10(d)) the bicarbonate bands became less intense, while
the formate bands became more prominent. This contrast in
the surface species given by the presence or absence of Cu
clearly indicates that the formate species formed on the Cu
surface migrate to the alumina surface and gradually cover the
latter surface during the reaction. The gradual decrease of
bicarbonate species indicates the replacement of bicarbonate
species by formate species on the alumina surface.
Furthermore, the eﬀects of K and Ba promoters on the
formation of surface species were investigated by the identical
experiments with Cu–K/Al2O3 and Cu–Ba/Al2O3 (Fig. 11). Similar
to the case of Cu/Al2O3, initially the formation of bicarbonate
species was confirmed but to a lesser extent for Cu–Ba/Al2O3
(Fig. 11(a–c)) with a similar temporal profile as observed for
Cu/Al2O3; an initial increase and later decrease of the bicarbo-
nate bands with time. This is likely due to the modification of
the alumina surface by the Ba promoter as evidenced from the
less formation of bicarbonate species and less distinct formate
species on alumina. Importantly, bidentate formate species on
the Cu surface was confirmed by the bands at 2930, 2850, and
1350 cm1, even more clearly identifiable than in the case of
the unpromoted Cu catalyst. The results prove a good accessi-
bility of the Cu surface under the reaction conditions when
promoted with Ba.
More prominent promoter eﬀects on the type of formed
surface species were evidenced for Cu–K/Al2O3 (Fig. 11(d–f)).
Notably, no formation of bicarbonate species was observed
from the initial period of the reaction, and the absence of
formate species on Cu was suggested both in the C–H and C–O
stretching regions. This is clear evidence that the K promoter is
well dispersed and strongly modified the surface properties of
both Cu and alumina. The bands at 2775, 2685, 1590, and
1350–1330 cm1 are assigned to the bidentate formate due to the
specific interactions with K.33,50,51 Diﬀerent spectral features in

the C–H stretching region compared to those of Cu/Al2O3 and
Cu–Ba/Al2O3 as well as the very broad feature of the two bands
between 1700 and 1200 cm1 imply that various configurations
of formate species exist on the surface.
Fig. 12 shows a pictorial representation of possible inter-
mediates and the arrangements of promoters on the surfaces of
the three catalysts indicated from ex situ/in situ characterization
results.
Impact of K and Ba promoters and possible reaction
mechanisms
The catalytic tests clearly showed the prominent eﬀects of K/Ba
promoters to the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst and on the product selectiv-
ity in methanol synthesis at low and elevated pressures. For Cu/
Al2O3 and Cu–Ba/Al2O3, the productivity of methanol was found
to be always higher than those reported in the literature under
similar GHSV conditions,52–54 benefited from our high-pressure
approach. All three catalysts greatly enhanced the RWGS activity
at higher temperatures. At 0.4 MPa, the obtained conversions for
Cu/Al2O3 and Cu–K/Al2O3 catalysts were comparable to those
reported for Cu/SiO2 and K promoted Cu/SiO2.
18
The addition of K and Ba promoters played significant roles in
selecting the pathway over the two major competitive reactions,
i.e. methanol synthesis and RWGS, occurring in the CO2
hydrogenation reaction. Although controversies exist on the
reaction mechanisms, it has been widely reported in the
literature that formate dissociation, forming CO, is the major
reaction pathway for the RWGS reaction,55–60 while hydrogena-
tion of formate species is the major one for the methanol
formation.55,61–65 Correlating the results obtained in the pre-
sent investigation with those in the literature, we propose that
the addition of the K promoter enhances the formate dissocia-
tion capability, whereas the addition of the Ba promoter
inhibits the dissociation process or promotes the formate
hydrogenation process.
As evident from characterization results, the K promotion to
the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst strongly reduced the Cu metal surface
area and slightly altered the BET surface area, indicating that
the K promoter covers most of the Cu surface with very high
dispersion, possibly as a thin layer, as suggested by XRD. The
shifting to higher temperatures of the two peaks for the
reduction of CuO in H2-TPR (Fig. 3) and also of peak (I) in
CO2-TPD (Fig. 4) of the Cu–K/Al2O3 catalyst compared to those
of the unpromoted one indicates hindering of the reduction
process and thus low hydrogenation activity of Cu, possibly due
to the coverage of the K promoter over the Cu surface. The
absence of formates directly associated with Cu and bicarbonate
species on the alumina surface clarified by in situ DRIFTS study
also confirms the full coverage of the Cu surface and a strong
modification of surface acidity by the K promoter. It identified
the presence of unique types of surface formates interacting with
K by the creation of active sites at the interface between Cu and
K.18,38,66 The dominant presence of formates interacting with
K–Cu and over the alumina surface without an exposed Cu surface
promoted dissociation of formates over the formate hydrogena-
tion, resulting in the high RWGS selectivity of Cu–K/Al2O3.
In the case of the Ba promotion, a significant reduction in
the BET surface area was observed with an unexpected increase
in the copper metal surface area. The XRD pattern of the
as-prepared and spent catalyst revealed that the barium compo-
nent exists as barium carbonate but in a highly dispersed state as
indicated by the very broad and weak diﬀraction peaks. The Ba
promoter obviously interacts with Cu components during the
activation (reduction in the H2 process, Fig. 3), facilitates
the reduction of CuO, and prevents the sintering as observed
by the smaller Cu crystallite size in Cu–Ba/Al2O3 than that in
Cu/Al2O3, while keeping the Cu surface exposed and not covering
it as evidenced from in situ DRIFTS study. The CO2-TPD study

(Fig. 4) showed the increased amount of released CO2 from the
surface species while retaining the same desorption temperature of
peak (I) of Cu/Al2O3. This result indicates a higher concentration of
surface species, formates according to the in situ DRIFTS study,
when the catalyst is promoted with Ba and the easiness of their
decomposition as in Cu/Al2O3. According to the higher temperature
of peak (I) observed for Cu–K/Al2O3, this decomposition of surface
formates is assisted by the exposed Cu surface. It is generally
accepted that a higher Cu metal surface area is beneficial for
methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation.67 The exposed high
metallic Cu surface as well as the low stability of the surface
formate species in the Ba promoted catalyst likely promoted
its hydrogenation to methanol rather than formate dissociation
leading to the formation of CO.
During the reaction, the Ba promoter might not exist as
barium carbonate as observed in XRD of the as prepared and
spent Cu–Ba/Al2O3 catalysts. It is possible that carbonates were
formed after the exposure of catalyst to air. The absence of
barium carbonates after the reduction was also reported by
Weigel et al. using in situ IR spectroscopy.68 It is most likely that
barium exists as hydroxide or oxide, forming transient carbo-
nate species. Millar et al. have reported that alkali ions form
hydroxylic species in the presence of water.69 According to
reactions (1) and (2), water is the side product and always
present during CO2 hydrogenation. Therefore, it is unlikely that
barium can exist in an oxide state under the reducing reaction
conditions and in the presence of water. The XRD pattern
obtained after the reaction shows an increased crystallite size
of barium carbonate. The proneness of barium hydroxides to
form large particles by agglomeration was reported in the study
of Vedage et al.20 From these observations, we speculate that the
barium component remains in a hydroxide state, temporarily
forming its carbonates, during the reaction.
Moreover, the formation of dimethyl ether was observed
mainly for Cu/Al2O3. It has been proven that the selective
dehydration of methanol is conditioned by the acidic function
of the solid-acid catalysts such as g-alumina,70,71 which was
used in this study as the support material. Although g-alumina
catalyses the methanol dehydration reaction to form dimethyl
ether, Xu et al. reported that water blocks the active sites
through competitive adsorption with methanol on the catalyst
surface.72 Also, the study by Jun et al. showed that addition of
water rapidly (in ca. 20 min) deactivates the alumina catalyst
activity towards dimethyl ether synthesis.73 The formation of
methanol or CO involves the formation of equal amount of
water. In this study, the highest amount of methanol and CO
was observed at 36 MPa, which in return implies the highest
amount of water formation under these conditions. Thus, a
significant amount of water formed during the reaction might
have modified the surface sites of g-alumina, inhibiting the
formation of dimethyl ether as evidenced by the strong suppres-
sion of the reaction at 36 MPa for Cu/Al2O3. Also, this reaction was
fully suppressed in the case of K promotion and eﬃciently
suppressed in the case of Ba promotion. It is possible that acidic
sites on the alumina were neutralised by the addition of alkali and
alkaline earth metal components. In the case of K promotion,
no dimethyl ether formation was observed likely due to the high
level of suppression of methanol synthesis activity as well as
homogeneous coverage of the catalyst surface by the K component.
In the case of the Ba promoter, higher productivity of methanol as
well as its major coverage over the alumina support, as indicated by
a significantly less amount of bicarbonate species over Cu–Ba/Al2O3
compared to that observed over Cu/Al2O3, resulted in a good
level of inhibition of the dehydration activity of alumina, thus
the eﬃcient suppression of dimethyl ether formation, and
enhancement of methanol selectivity.
Furthermore, Ai studied the impact of alkali and alkaline
earth metal on the dehydrogenation activity of methanol to
methyl formate.67 Both types of promoters showed an increase
in the activity but the eﬀect was more prominent in the latter
case. The findings were explained by the modification of acid–
base properties of the support and metal catalyst. Although
both K and Ba promoters were reported to enhance the activity
in methanol dehydrogenation, we observed the formation
of methyl formate with an increase in pressure and at low
temperatures with Cu–Ba/Al2O3. It is speculated that under
these reaction conditions the concentration of methanol became
suﬃciently high to produce methyl formate by the enhanced
methanol productivity from the positive impacts of high-pressure
and Ba promotion. On the other hand, no methyl formate
could be detected because of the low activity of Cu–K/Al2O3 in
methanol synthesis.
Conclusions
The present study shows the positive impacts of high pressure
conditions to achieve high conversion and selectivity towards
methanol in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. As expected, the
reaction temperature had a drastic influence on the catalytic
performance. It has been clearly demonstrated that low tempera-
tures and high pressures are favourable conditions for methanol
synthesis using the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by the impregna-
tion route in this work, but this may not be a necessarily
favourable condition for the Cu and Cu/ZnO catalysts prepared
by the coprecipitation route where Cu can occur in a highly
dispersed state and possibly highly defective. The formation of
dimethyl ether over Cu/Al2O3 due to dehydration of methanol,
mediated by the surface acidity of alumina, was greatly suppressed
at 36 MPa. This shows that increase in pressure strongly enhances
the catalyst activity and it is likely that the amount of water formed
as a co-product is suﬃciently high to inhibit the side dehydration
reaction to dimethyl ether.
Potassium and barium promotion had a great influence on
the selection of the CO2 hydrogenation pathways. K and Ba
promotion enhanced CO and methanol selectivity, respectively,
the tendency being particularly prominent at lower tempera-
tures. The eﬀect of the promoters on product distribution was
found to be consistent with increase in pressure, where the
eﬀect of the K promoter was more prominent than Ba. Both
promoters eﬃciently hindered the formation of dimethyl ether,
which can be correlated with the neutralisation of alumina
acidity by the promoters. A further increase in pressure to 36 MPa

resulted in the observation of a good amount of methyl formate
along with methanol for Cu–Ba/Al2O3, which was explained
by the unique combination of the high methanol production
and the modified surface acid–base property given by the Ba
promotion. The promoter eﬀects on the surface species under
reaction conditions have been clearly identified by in situ
DRIFTS study.
Both promoters were highly dispersed over the catalyst;
the Ba component exists as small crystallites mainly on the
alumina support but interacts strongly with Cu and promotes
the reducibility of Cu, while the K component exists as nano-
crystallites or thin layers covering the surfaces of both alumina
and copper. The high accessibility and enhanced reducibility of
the Cu surface of the Ba promoted catalyst was beneficial for
the formation of surface formates and further hydrogenation to
methanol. On the other hand, for Cu–K/Al2O3 the Cu surface
was covered by the K promoter and the hydrogenation ability of
Cu was hindered by the promotion. This eﬀect and enhanced
formation of surface formates on the alumina surface by the K
promotion likely led to enhanced probability of surface formate
decomposition, as the major pathway for the RWGS reaction.
The benefit of increasing pressure shown on the CO2 conver-
sion will be further investigated with an expanded pressure
range of up to 100 MPa.
