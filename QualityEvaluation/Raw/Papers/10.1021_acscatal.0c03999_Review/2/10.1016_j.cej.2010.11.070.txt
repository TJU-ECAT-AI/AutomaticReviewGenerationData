In the present work catalysts prepared by a new perspective method of metal vapour synthesis were
studied in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant. This
method let to obtain on the catalyst surface a high dispersed chromium species even at high chromium
loadings. On the surface of the catalysts with the chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only chromate species
were found, the further increase of the chromium loading results in the appearance of the -Cr2O3. The
catalyst with 6.0 wt% demonstrated also the highest catalytic activity with the yield in propene 69%.

1. Introduction
Supported chromium catalysts play a relevant role in many
important industrial chemical processes, both actual (e.g, the
Phillips catalysts of the polymerization of ethene [1–4]) and per-
spective. Among these latter is the oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane (ODH), where O2, CO2 or a CO2 + O2 mixture can be used
like an oxidant agents [5–14]. Actually, this process has been the
subject of many investigations, and a number of catalysts have
been evaluated [15]. However, catalysts based on Cr are among
the more effective, and the optimisation of their behavior is still
a target to be attained. In this respect, a basic point is repre-
sented by the achievement of a high dispersion of chromium, as
isolated/oligomeric CrOx species are supposed to exhibit the high-
est catalytic activity. The traditional preparation method based on
wet impregnation is characterized by a low cost and operational
easy, but it appeared unable to prevent the formation of agglom-
erated species and Cr2O3 particles, that are less effective or even
effective towards side reactions (e.g., total oxidation) respectively.
Conversely, “one-pot” methods for the preparation of Cr/MCM-41

[9,10,16] and Cr/SBA-15 [17,18] materials with highly isolated Cr
species exposed at the inner wall of the channels of a silica regular
mesoporous matrix have been developed, but Cr contents higher
than 1 wt% usually resulted in the depletion of the mesoporous
structure. Here, we reported the possibility to prepare Cr/SiO2
catalysts for ODH by using the so called “metal vapour synthesis
(MVS) method”. The co-condensation at low temperature of metal
vapour (commonly produced on lab scale by resistance heating
and on larger scale by electron beam vaporization) with vapour
of weakly stabilizing organic ligands (such as mesitylene, acetone
or acetonitrile), using commercially available reactors [19], affords
solvent-stabilized metal atoms (solvated metal atoms, SMA) sol-
uble in the excess of ligand [20,21]. Depending from the kind of
the organic ligand SMA can afforded well deﬁned organo-metallic
species [22] or solvent stabilized metal clusters suitable for the
preparation of supported metal systems on a wide range of organic
and inorganic materials [23–26]. Thus, this method appears as a
good candidate for the attainment of a high dispersion of sup-
ported species even at quite high loading. Actually, the presence
of a high amount of possibly isolated Cr species is among the basic
requirement for setting up highly active ODH catalysts, that, if char-
acterized also by a good selectivity and stability, could be of interest
for actual applications. In this paper we report on CrOx/SiO2 cata-
lysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis that were tested in the
reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation using a mild oxi-
dant (CO2).

2. Material and methods
Catalysts (here/after Cr–SiO2-MVS) were prepared using metal
vapour synthesis (MVS) [19–26]. According to that method
chromium (800 mg) was sublimed by resistive heating in an
alumina coated tungsten wire crucible. Chromium vapour was co-
condensed with mesitylene vapour (60 mL) on the cooled walls
of a previously described glass reactor [21] maintained at the
liquid nitrogen temperature (−196 ◦C) for 1 h. As a result it was
obtained a solid matrix which, at the end of the reaction, was
allowed to melt under vacuum at ca. −40 ◦C simply removing the
nitrogen liquid bath and warming up the solution at 25 ◦C. The
resulting deep red solution containing mono- and oligonuclear
chromium–mesitylene species [22] was worked up under dry argon
atmosphere with the use of standard Schlenk techniques and kept
at 25 ◦C. The amount of chromium in the above solutions was
evaluated by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spec-
trometers (ICP-OES) with a Spectro-Genesis instrument, using a
software Smart Analyzer Vision. The support (commercial silica
KSKG, Russia) was ground and sieved to obtain the fraction with
particle size in 0.25–0.5 mm and than this fraction was calcined in
air ﬂow at 600 ◦C for 2 h.
The deep red [Cr–mesitylene] solution was added to an appro-
priate amount of a suspension of the support in mesitylene under
dry argon atmosphere and was stirred at room temperature until
the liquid phase became colorless (overnight). The organic phase
was than removed via syringe and powdered catalyst was washed
with n-pentane and dried under vacuum at room temperature, than
calcined at 600 ◦C in air ﬂow for 2 h.
Catalytic studies were carried out in a ﬂow-reactor at T = 600 ◦C
and atmospheric pressure. The composition of the reaction feed
was: C3H8:CO2:N2 = 15:30:55. Before the reaction all catalysts were
activated in air ﬂow at T = 600 ◦C for at least 2 h. The reaction prod-
ucts were analysed by GC methods using two columns – molecular
sieves 5A (H2, O2, N2, CH4, CO) and Porapak Q (CO2, hydrocar-
bons). After the experiment catalysts were regenerated in air ﬂow
at T = 600 ◦C for 6 h.
Speciﬁc surface area (SSA) were measured with a Micromeritics
ASAP 2010 by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K following the BET model,
while pore volume and size were calculated by using the BJH model
(adsorption branch). Before measurements all samples were out-
gassed at 200 ◦C until a residual pressure 1.0 × 10−4 Torr (1 Torr:
133.33 Pa).
Observations and analysis of the powders by transmission
electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spec-
troscopy (TEM-EDS) were performed with a JEOL 3010-UHR
instrument (acceleration potential of 300 kV) equipped with an
Oxford Inca Energy TEM 200 EDS X-rays analyzer. To obtain a good
dispersion and avoid any contamination, lacey carbon Cu grids were
brieﬂy contacted with the powders, resulting in the adhesion of
some particles to the sample holders by electrostatic interactions.
When EDS was used in mapping mode, the Cr K emission at 5.4 kV
was selected.
Diffuse Reﬂectance UV–Vis spectroscopy (DR UV–Vis) measure-
ments were performed with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda19 instrument
equipped with an integrating sphere with the internal surface cov-
ered inside with BaSO4. The catalysts (diluted with bare silica in a
1:12 rates by weight) were placed in a ﬂow reactor connected with
a side branch sealed with an optical quartz cell for the UV–Vis mea-
surements. The samples were treated in the reactor at 600 ◦C under
ﬂow of oxygen for 2 h, than cooled to room temperature and kept
in static O2. The powder was then transferred in the side branch for
the UV–Vis measurements.
FTIR spectra were collected using Vector 22 spectrometer
equipped with a MCT detector and running at 4 cm−1 resolution.
The catalyst powders were pressed in self supported pellets and
placed in a quartz cell with KBr windows that allow all neces-
sary thermal treatments and the subsequent adsorption of the
probe molecule (NH3) without exposure the catalyst pellet to air.
Before IR measurements the samples were heated in 100 Torr of
O2, T = 550 ◦C, 1 h and than outgassed at the same temperature for
1 h (residual pressure 1.0 × 10−5 Torr, 1 Torr: 133.33 Pa). Spectra of
absorbed NH3 are reported in Absorbance after subtraction of the
IR pattern before NH3 admission onto the sample. High purity NH3
(Matheson) was used dried by passing through a trap cooled with
solid/liquid ethanol mixture before admission in the cell.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Textural features of the catalysts
Catalysts Cr–SiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt%
exhibited a speciﬁc surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease
of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content
(Table 1, Part A). The catalyst with Cr loading of 10.0 wt% showed
a decrease of speciﬁc surface area of ca. 20% with a further loss of
total pore volume and a sharp decrease of average pore diameter
that should result from the ﬁlling or blockage of the smallest pores
by chromium species.
For the sake of comparison, the values for the catalysts pre-
pared by wet impregnation method (hereafter: Cr–SiO2-WI) are
also reported [5] (Table 1, Part B). It can be observed, that the
two types of catalysts with the similar chromium loadings exhibit
similar textural features.
The pore size distribution remained monomodal (the highest
pore fraction with the size 14 nm) for all studied samples. Up to
the Cr loading of 6.0 wt% the porosity of the catalysts was similar
to that exhibited by the bare support, indicating that highly dis-
persed chromium particles do not block silica pores. Conversely,
the increase of Cr loading up to 10.0 wt% resulted in the decrease of
the pore size that can be due to the formation of bulky supported
species on the silica surface.
Such an evolution of textural features was accounted by changes
in structure and morphology observed by TEM. The samples with
Cr loading up to 6.0 wt% appeared constituted by irregular particles,
mainly constituted by SiO2, as checked by EDS (Fig. 1A). In addition
to a mapping of the location of Cr and Si was carried out by EDS,
and the contours of the obtained maps appeared almost coincident
with the borders of the particles aggregates, observed in the corre-
sponding TEM images, suggesting the presence of highly dispersed
Cr on the silica surface (Fig. 1B and C).
At Cr 10 wt% loading also big prismatic particles were clearly
observed (Fig. 2A). EDS revealed that they are essentially composed
by Cr and O (Fig. 2B), and on the basis of the spectroscopic data
reported in the following, they can be identiﬁed as -Cr2O3 parti-
cles. In the bigger fragment of the catalyst the presence of Si is also
observed (Fig. 2C).
3.2. DR UV–Vis spectroscopy
All samples were re-calcined in the UV–Vis cell in ﬂowing O2
and DR UV–Vis spectra of the not re-exposed to air catalysts were
recorded (Fig. 3, panel A). For the sake of comparison, the spectra
of the catalysts, prepared by wet impregnation (Fig. 3, panel B) and
the spectrum of the bare silica KSKG (Fig. 3, panel B, curve 1) are
also reported [5].
Bands at ca. 40,000, 27,000 (with an ill resolved shoulder at ca.
30,000 cm−1), and 21,500 cm−1 are present in the spectra of all cat-
alysts, prepared by both methods. The presence of these bands is
the evidence of oxygen to Cr6+ CT transitions of monochromates,
di- and/or polychromates grafted to the SiO2 surface [27a,28]. The

bands at 40,000 and 21,500 cm−1 did not appear structured enough
to distinguish the contribution of each of these species, while the
sub-bands at ca. 30,000 cm−1 and 27,000 cm−1 can be attributed
to di-and/or polychromates and monochromates, respectively. By
increasing the Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% (Fig. 3, panel A, curves
1–5) all mentioned bands progressively increased in intensity and
underwent a light shift towards high frequency, but no other band
was observed. At a higher Cr loading 10.0 wt% the intensity of the
bands at 40,000, 27,000 and 21,500 cm−1 increased insigniﬁcantly
and a new band at 16,500 cm−1 that can be assigned to the lowest
CT transition occurring in -Cr2O3 was observed, while in the spec-
tra of Cr–SiO2-WI catalysts this band (16,500 cm−1) appeared at the
chromium loading of 3.0 wt% already (Fig. 3, panel B, curves 4–6). As
the spectral changes occurred in such a region could be accounted
by the presence of progressively increasing amount of di-and poly-
chromates [27a–c], it can be supposed that depositing chromium
via metal vapour synthesis resulted in a higher dispersion of
the supported phase. Such a results of DR UV–Vis measure-
ments are in good correspondence with TEM-EDS data reported
above.

3.3. FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed NH3
The presence of the Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst surface
are an object of interest as such centres can promote the trans-
formation of initially produced oleﬁns, in particular starting the
processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking
[29]. The catalysts were tested by adsorption of ammonia, mon-
itored via IR. For the sake of simplicity, only the spectral range
where bands due to the deformation modes of adsorbed NH3 and
NH4+ species will be presented, being enough informative with
respect to the scope of this work. The catalysts were pre-outgassed
at high temperature, contacted with 20 Torr NH3 and then progres-
sively outgassed until prolonged pumping at room temperature.
IR spectra (not reported) indicated that at the end of this process
ammonia molecules were completely desorbed from silanols, while
components due to NH3 molecules adsorbed on Crn+ sites, acting
as Lewis acid centres, ammonium ions produced by interactions
with Brønsted acid centres, if any, and other species resulting from
chemical reactions between ammonia and surface sites underwent
changes due to the removal of physisorbed ammonia solvating
them only, while their desorption, in the adopted conditions, essen-
tially did not occur. For this reason, only the spectra related to such
irreversibly adsorbed species are shown in Fig. 5. The data are nor-
malized to both the mass and SSABET of the various materials, and
then the intensity of the IR bands is proportional to the amount of
the correspondent species per unit of surface area.
For the sake of comparison, NH3 adsorption was carried out
on the bare SiO2 support, resulting in the spectrum in curve 1
(Fig. 4, panel A), exhibiting only a very weak component at ca.
1460 cm−1, likely corresponding to the asymmetric deformation
mode of ammonium ions formed on impurity traces having a
Brønsted acid character. For the reference the same spectra on the
catalysts, prepared by wet impregnation method, are reported in
Fig. 4, panel B.
As for the spectra obtained for the MVS catalysts containing the
increasing amount of chromium (Fig. 4, panel A, curves 2–6), in all
cases they appeared dominated by band at 1615 cm−1 due to the
ıasym mode of ammonia molecules adsorbed on Crn+ surface centres
[30,31]. Unfortunately, such a vibrational modes is poorly sensitive
to the oxidation states (2+, 3+ or 6+) of the adsorbing chromium
centres [30,31], that, vice versa, could be probed by the features of
the ısym absorption, but it falls in the 1300–1100 cm−1 range, then
below the low frequency cut-off due to the silica support.
Moving towards lower frequency, the weak band at 1555 cm−1,
can be attributed to the ıNH2 mode of Si–NH2 species formed by
reaction of NH3 with strained Si–O–Si (and/or Si–O–Cr) bridges
[32,33]. The other product of this reaction should be Si–OH (and/or
Cr–OH) species, likely contributing to the broad and complex band
in the OH region (not shown).
Finally, a broad absorption with maximum at ca. 1445 cm−1 is
present, due to asymmetric bending modes of adsorbed ammo-
nium ions [30,31]. The symmetric bending mode of such species is
responsible for the very weak feature at ca. 1680 cm−1, so feeble
because related to forbidden IR transitions [30].
As for the behavior of these spectral components in dependence
on the Cr loading, it can be observed that the integrated intensity
of both the signals related to adsorbed ammonia molecules and
ammonium ions markedly did not changed signiﬁcantly for the
samples with low Cr loadings (0.5 and 1.3 wt%) and then increase
progressively with the increase of the chromium content (Fig. 4,

panel A, curves 2–6), while the integrated intensity of weaker band
due to Si–NH2 species increased up to 2.5 wt% of chromium and
that remains stable.
The heterogeneity of Cr species in the various catalysts evi-
denced by DR UV–Vis spectroscopy and the lack of sensitivity
towards adsorbing centres of the band related to ammonia stabi-
lized on such centres prevented the possibility to obtain speciﬁc
information on Cr surface sites along the series of catalysts from
the band at 1615 cm−1. However, the observed dependence of the
integrated intensity of such band on the Cr loading indicates some
possibility of the further increase of the amount of exposed Cr
centres by increasing the Cr amount over 10.0 wt%, in agreement
with the indication on the speciation and dispersion of Cr species
obtained from DR UV–Vis data.
Passing to the components related to adsorbed ammonium ions,
their presence clearly indicates that the supporting of chromium
resulted also in the appearance of Brønsted acid sites. The depen-
dence of the integrated intensity of the band at 1445 cm−1 on the Cr
loading, similar to that exhibited by the 1615 cm−1 band, suggests
that these acid centres could related to “not three-dimensional”
supported chromium species. Such a feature is similar to that
reported in the literature for V5+ [34–36] and Ti4+ [32]. The presence
of Brønsted acid sites is of interest in the elucidation of the sur-
face properties of the investigated catalysts, because, as reported in
the literature devoted to parafﬁn dehydrogenation processes [29]
these centres can promote the further transformation of initially
produced oleﬁns, in particular starting the processes leading to the
deactivation of the catalysts by cocking.
Finally, also the features related to the band at 1555 cm−1 due
to Si–NH2 species resulting from reaction of ammonia with of
Si–O–Si and/or Cr–O–Si strained bridges, deserve some comment.
The appearance of this component, and then the related surface
sites, resulted from the presence of chromium on the support.
Strained Si–O–Si bridges, reactive towards ammonia, are known
to be formed also on bare silica, but after outgassing treatment at
signiﬁcantly higher temperatures [37–39]. The formation of such
particular structure is then apparently promoted by the involve-
ment of the silica support in the ﬁxation of chromium species. A
similar behavior was found in the case of Ti4+ centres dispersed on
MCM-41 silica [32], although in that case the transition metal ions
were introduced in the silica carrier through a one-pot synthesis.
The other noticeable point is that the amount Si–NH2 species, and
then of parent Si–O–Si and/or Cr–O–Si strained bridges, increased
up to the 2.5 wt% of the chromium loading, suggesting that the for-
mation of such strained bridges is related to the formation of highly
dispersed chromium species.
As for the behavior of the same components in the spectra of the
catalysts, obtained by WI method, it can be observed that the inte-
grated intensity of both the signals related to adsorbed ammonia
molecules and ammonium ions markedly increase until the con-
tent of chromium is raised up to 3.0 wt%, and then increase less
signiﬁcantly (Fig. 4, panel B), while the weaker band due to Si–NH2
species exhibit essentially the same intensity independently of the
Cr loading. The observed dependence on the integrated intensity of
the band 1615 cm−1 on the Cr loading indicates the decline of the
possibility to further increase the amount of exposed Cr centres
by increasing the Cr amount over 3.0 wt% for WI catalysts. At the
same time the amount Si–NH2 species, and then of parent Si–O–Si
and/or Cr–O–Si strained bridges, did not depend on the Cr loading,
suggested that the highly dispersed chromium species was formed
in essentially the same amount as the amount of supported Cr on
the surface of WI catalysts was higher than 0.5 wt%.
The higher possibility of the increase of the amount of exposed
Cr centres with the increase of Cr loading together with the
observed increase of the formed Si–NH2 species up to 2.5 wt% of
chromium, monitors that by using the MVS method the higher
dispersion of chromium species can be attained.
3.4. Catalytic tests
The initial propane conversion (x), selectivity towards oleﬁns (S)
and oleﬁns yield (Y) for the catalysts with the different chromium
loading prepared by MVS technique in the oxidative dehydrogena-
tion of propane in the presence of CO2 are reported in Table 2.
Catalyst that contains only 0.5 wt% Cr already demonstrated
propane conversion of ca.45% that is almost equal to the propane
conversion that can be achieved on the catalyst with 5.0 wt% Cr
but prepared by standard method of wet impregnation (47%) [5].
Propane conversion increased with the increase of chromium load-
ing and on the catalyst with 6.0 wt% of chromium attained 85%. The
further increase of the chromium loading up to 10.0 wt% do not
result in the additional increase of propane conversion – it remains
on the level of 80%. Taking into account that the speciﬁc surface
area of the catalyst with 10.0 wt% Cr is ca. 20% lower than that of
the catalyst with 6.0 wt% Cr the catalyst with the higher chromium

Fig. 5. Catalytic properties vs. reaction time in the reaction of ODH of propane, T = 600 ◦C, w = 200 h−1, reaction mixture C3H8:CO2:N2 = 15:30:55 on the: (1) 0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS;
(2) 5.0-Cr/SiO2-WI catalysts. Panel A: C3H8 conversion. Panel B: total selectivity to oleﬁns (curves a) and total oleﬁn yield (curves b).
loading (10.0 wt%) exhibited even superior hydrocarbon conver-
sion per unit of surface area. As concerns propene selectivity its
values slightly decrease with an increase of the chromium content
(from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78 at 10.0 wt% Cr). Selectivity to ethylene
was on the level of 7–8% in all investigated range of the chromium
loading. On catalyst with chromium loading of 6.0 wt% total oleﬁn
yield reach 68%.
The results of the long-term tests for the MVS catalyst with
0.5 wt% chromium loading are reported in Fig. 5, curves “1”. For
the sake of comparison on the same ﬁgure the results of the similar
test for the WI catalyst with ten times higher chromium loading
(5.0 wt%) are presented (curves “2”) [5].
The initial conversion of propane on the 0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS cat-
alyst was ca. 42%, than in 400 min decreased till ca. 28% and then
remained stable for the next 400 min (Fig. 5, Panel A). In the same
reaction conditions the initial conversion of propane on the 5.0-
Cr/SiO2-WI catalyst reached ca. 45% and than in 400 min reduced
till ca. 30% and continue to decrease.
As for total oleﬁn selectivity (Fig. 5, Panel B, curves a) for the both
catalysts the close results were obtained (ca. 94% for 5.0-Cr/SiO2-
WI catalyst and ca. 92.5% for 0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS catalyst). Since the
propane conversions and total oleﬁn selectivity were almost the
same the total oleﬁn yields appeared also similar (Fig. 5, Panel B,
curves b). For the 0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS catalysts it was ca. 40% in the
beginning and than decrease till ca. 25%, and for 5.0%Cr/SiO2-WI
catalyst it falls down from initially 41% to ca. 30%.

of
0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS
and
5.0%Cr/SiO2-WI catalysts supposed that due to the higher dis-
persion of chromium species the amount of active centres on
the surface of 0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS catalyst was comparable with the
amount of active centres on the surface of SiO2-WI – the catalyst
with ten times higher chromium loading.
4. Conclusions
Presented data clearly indicate that metal vapour synthesis can
be successfully applied to obtain Cr/SiO2 catalytic materials, high
active and selective in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydro-
genation in the presence of CO2. The selectivity to main product
– propylene was higher than 80% and as a main by-product it
was produced another oleﬁn – ethylene. Consequently, the yield
of propylene was ca. 40% and higher for all studied catalysts with
the chromium loading higher than 0.5 wt%. Such a result superior
the major part of the publicized data [15] and can be of the indus-
trial interest. The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique
allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and
to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface
up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings. The catalytic activity
should be related to the presence of chromate species of various
nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Chromium loading higher
than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono- or poly-
chromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of
the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process. The
formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the
appearance of Brønsted acid sites, responsible for coke production,
and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.
