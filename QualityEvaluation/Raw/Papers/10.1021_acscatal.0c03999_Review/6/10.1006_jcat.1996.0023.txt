reached a maximum (1.5 wt%) and did not increase further
even at the highest loading of chromium oxide. For CrO3
contents higher than 2 wt%, the amount of soluble Cr61
steadily increased up to a content of 2 wt% (reached for
an overall CrO3 content of 4 wt%). For even higher CrO3
contents, the increase in this species was much less marked.
Finally, for overall CrO3 loadings higher than 4 wt% Cr31
was also found, and its content increased linearly with
increasing chromium oxide loading. This species was not
dissolved by the treatment with water.
Also reported in Fig. 1 is the value obtained by ﬁrst
treating the calcined 15.3 wt% CrO3 catalyst with water,
in order to remove the soluble Cr61 selectively, and then
calcining the catalyst again at 6008C. The amount of soluble
Cr61 was restored at the expense of the Cr31 species, which
correspondingly decreased by a similar amount.

in the entire NIR range, and a very broad band ranging
from 800 to 2000 nm stood out in the sample with higher
chromium oxide content. Such a broad band was also pres-
ent in commercial samples of pure a-Cr2O3, as also shown
in the Fig. 6. These data can be rationalized as follows:
(a) Bands at 260–270 and 380 nm are attributed to tetra-
hedral chromate transitions 1T2 r 1A1 (1t1 R 7t2 and
6t2 R 2e) and 1T2 r 1A1 (1t1 R 2e) respectively (14, 31,
36, 37).
(b) The peak at 470 nm is also assigned to a Cr61 transi-
tion 1T1 r 1A1 (1t1 R 2e). Since such a transition is symme-
try forbidden in Td symmetry, the intensity of this band
indicates the distortion of the Cr61 group from the Td
symmetry (typical of the chromate anion) caused by an-
