Abstract
The stability of various gallium species (Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2) as models for the active sites in reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and the possible
reaction paths of alkane dehydrogenation were studied using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach. In general, alkanes are
preferentially activated via an “alkyl” mechanism, in which gallium acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group. A comparison of the computed
energetics of the various reaction paths for ethane indicates that the catalytic reaction most likely proceeds over Ga+. The initial step of C–H
activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the
basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. Although the catalytic reaction can also occur over GaH2+ and GaH+2 sites, these paths are not favored.
Decomposition of GaH2+ leading to formation of Ga+ during the catalytic cycle is more favorable than regeneration of these sites. The reactivity
of GaH+2 ions is strongly dependent on the distance between the stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. In cases of greater Al–Al
distances, the stability of the GaH+2 species is very low, and it decomposes to Ga+ and a Brønsted acid site, whereas when Al atoms are located
more closely, the charge-compensating GaH+2 ions are the most stable and exhibit the lowest activity for the initial C–H bond cleavage reaction.

1. Introduction
Gallium- and zinc-exchanged H-ZSM-5 zeolites (Ga/ZSM-5
and Zn/ZSM-5) are known to be effective catalysts for promot-
ing the selective conversion of light alkanes to aromatics [1].
The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex
scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring-
closure steps [2–16]. The modifying cations play key roles in
dehydrogenation of parafﬁns [2–5,14–16], whereas Brønsted
acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the oleﬁns thus
produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization. Numer-
ous experimental [2–16] and theoretical [17–22] studies have
been devoted to investigating the mechanism of catalytic de-
hydrogenation of light alkanes over gallium-exchanged ZSM-5
zeolites. However, the structure of the active intrazeolite Ga

species and, accordingly, the mechanism of hydrocarbon acti-
vation have not been fully elucidated.
Extra-framework gallium is introduced into zeolites by ei-
ther a conventional ion-exchange technique or solid-state ion
exchange. In both cases, gallium is initially deposited on the
external surface of the zeolite crystals, because hydrated Ga+3
ions are too bulky to enter the elliptical channels of ZSM-5 [23].
The Ga2O3 species obtained after calcination are reduced dur-
ing pretreatment with hydrogen or with the hydrocarbon feed
to Ga2O species that migrate into the zeolite channels [11,12].
These mobile species react with the zeolitic Brønsted acid pro-
tons, resulting in formation of reduced cationic Ga+, GaH2+,
or GaH+2 species bound to zeolite oxygen atoms. The result-
ing material may contain several types of reduced Ga species
besides gallium oxide particles if the reduction process is not
complete. The oxide species may include bulkier aggregates on
the external surface or smaller ones in the micropore space of
the zeolite. Meitzner et al. [11] found using in situ Ga K-edge

lium is present in reduced Ga+ form, although the oxidation
state changes to 3+ on cooling to lower temperatures. Simi-
larly, Kazansky et al. [15] found that Ga+ species are the most
stable species at high temperatures and that oxidative addition
of hydrogen to Ga+ leads to GaH2+ species at lower tempera-
tures. It is important to note that these gallium hydride species
are relatively stable and decompose only slowly at higher tem-
peratures [15].
Recently, a new and completely anhydrous route for the
preparation of well-deﬁned cationic Ga species via chemical
vapor deposition of trimethylgallium to anhydrous HZSM-5 has
been reported [14–16,24–26]. Careful removal of the methyl
ligands by reduction leads to GaH2+ cations, which can then be
decomposed at high temperatures to Ga+ cations. When Ga+
cations are predominant in ZSM-5, stable activity in propane
dehydrogenation to propylene is observed [16]. Decreased ac-
tivity is found when the catalyst contains GaH2+ cations. The
higher activity at steady state is attributed to the decomposi-
tion of less active GaH2+ cations to Ga+ under the reducing
high-temperature reaction conditions.
Most theoretical studies have considered GaH2+ as the ac-
tive site for alkane dehydrogenation [17,18,21,22]. Frash and
van Santen [17] proposed a three-step mechanism including (i)
“alkyl” (Rδ−–Hδ+) activation of the C–H bond, resulting in the
formation of a zeolitic Brønsted acid proton and a rather un-
stable neutral H2Ga–R species; (ii) the subsequent desorption
of molecular hydrogen via recombination of the acidic proton
and one of the hydride ions bounded to gallium; and (iii) the
decomposition of the resulting [H–Ga–R]+ complex to alkene
and GaH2+. The decomposition step is rate-limiting, and an ac-
tivation energy of 254 kJ/mol is computed for a model reaction
of ethane dehydrogenation. Alternatively, a one-step concerted
mechanism over GaH2+ was recently considered by Pereira
and Nascimento [21]. The activation energy for this process is
substantially higher (by 90 kJ/mol) than the mechanism pro-
posed by Frash and van Santen [17] and, consequently, this
mechanism is less likely. Very recently, Joshi and Thomson
[22] proposed the existence of bivalent extra-framework gal-
lium species (GaH+2) close to a pair of tetrahedral framework
Al species in ZSM-5 zeolite as active sites for alkane dehy-
drogenation. The overall activation energy for the “carbenium”
pathway for ethane activation over GaH+2 species, which are
stabilized by two aluminum-containing oxygen tetrahedra, lie
in the range of 260–360 kJ/mol, depending on the cation site
at which GaH+2 species were stabilized. Moreover, the choice
for a positively charged alkyl group for the initial activation of
ethane contrasts with earlier proposals.
The recent experimental results indicating that Ga+ cations
are the active sites [14–16] led us to reconsider the reaction
mechanism of alkane activation over reduced Ga cations stabi-
lized in zeolites. Here we present a detailed comparative analy-
sis of the reactivity of various cationic species (Ga+, GaH2+,
and GaH+2) by density functional theory (DFT) cluster calcula-
tions. In addition, we discuss the relative stability of the various
cationic Ga species and the dependence of their chemical prop-
erties on the aluminum distribution in ZSM-5 zeolite.
2. Experimental
Dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite, as well
as stability of different gallium-containing active sites, was
studied using GaHAl2Si6O9H14 and GaH3Al2Si6O9H14 clus-
ter models, which represent two adjacent ﬁve rings from the
wall of the straight channel of ZSM-5 zeolite. Ga+, GaH2+, and
GaH+2 cations compensated the negative charge of the [AlO2]−
unit in one ring, whereas for the ﬁrst two types of cations,
the other negative charge in the other ring was stabilized by
a proton. Al atoms were placed in T12 and T8 lattice posi-
tions [27] to model a cation site (Zd) with distantly separated
anionic sites, whereas the next nearest T12 and T6 lattice posi-
tions were occupied with aluminum atoms in the cluster Zs. The
distance between two aluminum ions was equal to 8.14 Å for
the Zd cluster model and 4.84 Å for the Zs cluster model. Note
that the T12 site is located at the cross-section of the straight
and sinusoidal channels of ZSM-5; accordingly, the cations sta-
bilized in the vicinity of this site are considered to have the
highest accessibility. Therefore, the charge-compensating gal-
lium species were located in the ﬁve-ring-containing aluminum
at the T12 position. Hydrogen atoms were used to saturate
the dangling Si–O bonds at the periphery of the cluster. The
starting geometry of the clusters corresponded to the real lat-
tice of the ZSM-5 zeolite corresponding to X-ray diffraction
data [28].
DFT, with the B3LYP [29] hybride exchange-correlation
functional, was used to perform all of the calculations. Ear-
lier, the hybride B3LYP method was reported to provide ex-
cellent descriptions of various reaction proﬁles and particularly
of geometries, heats of reaction, activation energies, and vi-
brational properties of various molecules [30]. Geometry op-
timization and saddlepoint searches were all performed us-
ing the Gaussian 03 program [31]. The 6-31G(d,p) basis set
was used for the exchanged gallium cation and the bridg-
ing hydroxyl group, whereas the ethane molecule and the ze-
olitic oxygen atoms were described by the 6-311G(d,p) ba-
sis set. Al and Si atoms of the zeolite framework, as well as
the boundary (H∗) hydrogen atoms, were treated by the D95-
Dunning/Huzinaga basis set. It was shown earlier that such a
compromise is successful for studies of cation-exchanged zeo-
lites [32–34].
As described previously [32–34], special restrictions on the
positions of the boundary H∗atoms were imposed during the
optimization procedure. In short, the structure of the initial
zeolite cluster was ﬁrst constrained to the X-ray diffraction
data [28]. Subsequently, only Si–H∗and Al–H∗bond lengths
and the position of the gallium ion were optimized, whereas
positions of the other atoms, as well as the directions of the
bonds, were ﬁxed according to crystallographic data. The posi-
tions of the H∗atoms in all subsequent calculations were then
ﬁxed, whereas the positions of the remaining atoms of the clus-
ter were optimized. All of the energies obtained from the DFT
calculations used for estimating the reaction heats and activa-
tion barriers were corrected for the zero-point energy.

3. Results
3.1. Structure and properties of active sites
Fig. 1 displays the optimized structures of Ga+, GaH2+, and
GaH+2 ions stabilized in the Zd (distantly separated Al ions)
and Zs (Al ions in the next-nearest positions). Table 1 lists the
corresponding optimized Ga–O and Ga–H bond lengths, the
atomic charges, and the relative energies. The univalent cations
Ga+ and GaH2+ are located in close vicinity to one of alu-
minum atoms (T12) and coordinate to two adjacent oxygen
atoms (O1 and O2). The structural parameters show that the
Ga–O bonds (Ga–O1 and Ga–O2) between Ga and lattice oxy-
gens are somewhat shorter for the dihydrido-gallyl ion than for
the Ga+ cation. On the other hand, the Ga–O distances to the
other oxygens (Ga–O3 and Ga–O4) of the cluster are shorter
in the latter case. This is most likely due to the repulsive in-
teractions of basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework with
the negatively charged hydride ions in the bonded GaH2+ com-
plex. On the other hand, weak electrostatic interaction of Ga+
ion with remote zeolitic oxygens leads to additional stabiliza-
tion of the cation. This is also supported by the fact that the
increased basicity of O3 and O4 atoms due to exchange of the
Si by Al atom at framework T6 position results in a signiﬁ-
cant decrease of the corresponding Ga–O distances in the Ga Zs
cluster. The computed Ga–O and Ga–H distances for GaH2+
species stabilized in either Zd or Zs clusters agree very well
with those reported for the dihydrido-gallyl ion in the extended
cluster model containing 11 T atoms [22], corresponding to the
cation site located at the cross-section of the straight and sinu-
76

soidal channels of ZSM-5 zeolite. We infer that the presence of
an additional anionic site in our model that is balanced by an
acidic proton does not signiﬁcantly affect the properties of the
gallium-containing sites (Ga+ and GaH2+).
The bivalent GaH+2 ion is preferentially located at the Zd
site (Fig. 1c) near the Al1 atom and at a rather long distance
[r(Ga–Al2) = 6.857 Å] from the second anionic site of the
cluster. Table 1 shows that the GaH+2 ion is coordinated by four
oxygen atoms, two of which are bonded at a somewhat shorter
distance (∼0.2 Å) due to the lower basicity of the oxygen atoms
of the silicon-occupied oxygen tetrahedra compared with those
of the aluminum-occupied tetrahedra. This is in agreement with
the fact that the GaH+2 ion sits almost in the center (Ga–Al1
and Ga–Al2 distances are equal to 2.995 and 2.957 Å, respec-
tively) of the 5T rings containing two anionic sites (GaH Zs
structure; Fig. 1f ).
The Lewis acidic properties of the GaH+2 ions should be
similar to those of Zn+2, and, accordingly, we would expect
similar bonding properties of these charge-compensating ions
with the zeolite. Indeed, the Zn–O bond lengths (Table 1) re-
ported by Zhidomirov et al. [32–34] for zinc stabilized at the
similar cationic site cohere well with the geometry parameters
of the GaH Zd cluster, taking into account the slightly smaller
radius of the Ga3+ cation. The geometry of the GaH Zs corre-
lates also very well with that reported by Shubin et al. [35] for
zinc ions stabilized in the 5T zeolitic ring containing two alu-
minum atoms (Table 1). Therefore, one expects the GaH+2 ions
to exhibit similar chemical properties to those of exchanged
zinc ions.
Desorption of H2 from GaH2+ (1) resulting in formation of
Ga+ ions is slightly endothermic (Table 1). However, due to in-
crease of entropy at high temperature, the equilibrium of this
process is shifted strongly toward Ga+ formation (G◦
823 K =
−75 and −101 kJ/mol, respectively, for Zd and Zs models).
This ﬁnding corresponds well to the experimental observa-
tion that charge-compensating Ga+ ions are transformed into
dihydrido-gallyl ions only at lower temperatures in hydrogen
atmosphere [11,15]. Dehydrogenation of these species, result-
ing in formation of univalent gallium ions, was found to proceed
on high-temperature treatment in inert atmosphere or in vacuum
[15],
(1)
GaH2+Z−⇄Ga+Z−+ H2.
Formation of GaH+2 ions from Ga+ and a Brønsted acid pro-
ton (2) is found to be a strongly endothermic process (E =
+88 kJ/mol) for the case of a long Al–Al distance (Zd mode)
and a strongly exothermic process (E = −102 kJ/mol) when
two Al atoms are placed at the next-nearest positions of the
cation site (Table 1),
Ga+Z−+ H+Z−⇄Z−+ GaH+2Z−.
(2)
Therefore, we predict that for relatively long Al–Al distances,
the equilibrium of reaction (2) shifts to the side of the univa-
lent Ga+ ion and the proton. On the other hand, when located
in the vicinity of two anionic sites, the bivalent GaH+2 ion is
more stable (by 102 kJ/mol) than the Ga+ Zs site (Table 1),
and the equilibrium will shift to the formation of the gallium
monohydride.
3.2. Ethane dehydrogenation over Ga+
In agreement with recent experimental DRIFTS investiga-
tions [14], molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga Zd does not
result in any speciﬁc interaction between C2H6 and the ad-
sorption site at low temperature. The geometry and charge
properties of both the C2H6 moiety and the cluster model in
the adsorption complex are similar to those calculated for the
individual fragments. Recent experiments [15] indicate that
at moderate temperature (523 K), dehydrogenation of ethane
over Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite is initiated by dissociative adsorption of
C2H6 on charge-compensating reduced Ga+ species, resulting
in the formation of gallium-ethyl hydride according to
Ga+Z−+ C2H6 →[H–Ga–C2H5]+Z−.
(3)
Reaction (3) as written corresponds to an oxidative addition of
ethane to Ga+, resulting in oxidation of the univalent gallium
to Ga+3. The activation energy of the direct homolytic cleavage
of the C–H bond of an ethane molecule on the Ga Zd cluster is
computed as 374 kJ/mol [Fig. 2, route (a), TS1′]. This barrier
is too high to explain the experimentally observed formation of
[C2H5–Ga–H]+ species (II) at 523 K. Moreover, the value for
the activation energy is very close to the C–H bond energy in
molecular ethane (423 kJ/mol [36]). Thus, it appears that for
the case of ethane activation over Ga+-exchanged ZSM-5, sta-
bilization of the nonpolar transition state (TS1′) is very weak,
and most likely the role of the active site is limited to stabi-
lize the products of the homolytic dissociation of ethane via
chemisorption of C2H5 and H radicals.
Generally, alkanes are activated over transition metal com-
plexes [37–39] via formation of a σ-C2H6 complex. The bond-
ing of a hydrocarbon molecule with the transition metal ion in
such complexes is described by a synergetic combination of the
ligand-to-metal donation from the σ C–H orbitals of the hydro-
carbon to the partially occupied s-orbital of the transition metal
(TM) and the metal-to-ligand back-donation from the dπ or-
bital to the C–H σ ∗-orbitals. Such interactions result in a very
strong weakening of the C–H bond, which in turn, together with
formation of new TM...C and TM...H bonds, signiﬁcantly
facilitates homolytic C–H bond cleavage. However, the fully
occupied 3d-orbitals of univalent gallium are of too-low energy
and thus do not contribute to the backdonation. Moreover, be-
cause the 4s-orbital is occupied, it will not act effectively as
an electron-acceptor orbital. Thus, the formation of the σ CH
complex between ethane and Ga+ is unlikely, and, correspond-
ingly, the energy cost for the homolytic dissociation of ethane
over Ga Zd is very close to that for the gas-phase dissociation.
Alternatively, the interaction with a soft Lewis acid–base
pair consisting of Ga+ and the basic oxygen atom of the ze-
olite lattice appears to be responsible for the initial C–H bond
cleavage. This route of heterolytic activation of the C–H bond is
shown in Fig. 2, route (b). The geometry and charge parameters
of the intermediates and transition-state structures are summa-
rized in Table 2. In the initial step, heterolytic dissociation of the

a For isolated C2H6 molecule distances and charges were computed at B3LYP DFT level with 6-311G(d,p). For isolated C2H4 molecule Mulliken charges
computed at the same level are −0.219 and 0.109 on C and H atoms, respectively.
C–H bond results in formation of a neutral Ga–C2H5 species
in the vicinity of a zeolitic Brønsted acid site (I). The calcu-
lated activation energy (TS1, 210 kJ/mol) is signiﬁcantly lower
than that obtained for the homolytic path. The corresponding
transition state structure (TS1) is characterized by very strong
polarization of the reacting C–H bond following the “alkyl”
mechanism; that is, both the positive charge on the H atom
and the negative charge on carbon strongly increase compared
with gas-phase C2H6. At the same time, the positive charge on
the gallium decreases, indicating weakening bonds between the
cation and zeolitic oxygen. The partial negative charge on the
O1 atom also decreases due to bonding with the proton from
ethane. Similar effects were also observed for the O3 atom of
the Zs cluster model (Table 1) for the Ga Zs and GaH2 Zs clus-
ters.
The intermediate (I) resulting from heterolytic activation of
ethane over the Ga Zd site is very unstable and readily re-
arranges to the stable product (II). This reaction proceeds via
oxidation of the Ga–C2H5 species by the Brønsted acid site
with a very low activation barrier (9 kJ/mol, TS2). The ease
of formation of complex (II) also explains why only the prod-
uct of oxidative addition was observed experimentally [15].
The ﬁnal step in ethane dehydrogenation over Ga+ was
found to be a one-step desorption of H2 and C2H4 molecules via
the TS3 structure. This reaction can be described as a “destruc-
tive reductive elimination,” resulting in reduction of the Ga+3

ion and regeneration of the initial Ga Zd site. Table 2 shows that
the hydrogen atoms of the free methyl group in structure II are
positively charged, whereas the H atom bounded to gallium is
negatively charged. Hence, the catalytic cycle is closed by the
recombination of these atoms to form molecular hydrogen via
transition state TS3. The activation barrier of the latter process
is computed as 224 kJ/mol. This value is slightly higher than
that calculated for the initial C–H cleavage (210 kJ/mol). The
overall activation energy of the ethane dehydrogenation over
the reduced dehydrogenated Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite is 233 kJ/mol.
3.3. Ethane activation over GaH2+
To compare the reactivities of the various charge-compensa-
ting gallium species, we investigated the alkyl activation path-
way over the GaH2+ site proposed by Frash and van San-
ten [17] with the present Zd cluster model. The energetics
for this mechanism are presented in Fig. 3, and the geometry
and charge parameters of the intermediates and transition-state
structures are listed in Table 3.
Similar to the ﬁndings for Ga+, molecular adsorption of
ethane on the dihydrido-gallyl ion stabilized in the Zd cluster
was very weak and did not result in any signiﬁcant perturbation
of either the adsorbed molecule or the adsorption site. Thus, it
is assumed that this molecular adsorption does not inﬂuence the
subsequent chemical activation of C2H6 molecules. The mech-
anism of the initial activation of the hydrocarbon molecule on
dihydrido-gallyl ion is very similar to that suggested for the het-
erolytic dissociation of ethane on Ga Zd. Indeed, a very strong
polarization of the reacting C–H bond is observed in the TS4
structure, leading to heterolytic C–H bond splitting with forma-
tion of a neutral (H−)2Ga+3–C2H5−species in the vicinity of
a Brønsted acid site (III). The calculated activation energy for
this elementary step (193 kJ/mol) is signiﬁcantly higher than
that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously [17] for GaH2+ species
stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. On the other hand, the
present value is slightly lower than that (203 kJ/mol) reported
by Yoshi and Thomson [22] for the dihydrido-gallyl ion stabi-
lized at a more extended cluster model containing 11T atoms.
We attribute the higher activation barrier than that reported by
Frash and van Santen [17] mainly to greater steric hindrance of
the interaction of the C–H bond with the Ga...O pair caused
by the constrained geometry and the larger size of the clus-
ter model. The difference between the present result and that
reported in [22] is also attributed to the steric factors and to dif-
ferent basic properties of the zeolitic O atom involved in the
C–H activation resulting from size differences of the cluster
model.
The H2Ga–C2H6 species formed in the initial step are stabi-
lized by interaction between a hydride ion (H1′) bonded to the
gallium and an acidic proton (H1). This interaction results in
a strong elongation (by about 0.2 Å) of the O1–H1 bond. The
Ga–O2 distance in structure III (Table 3) is signiﬁcantly less
than the corresponding distance in structure I (Table 2) and is
indicative of the stronger interaction of the trivalent gallium in
the H2Ga–C2H6 species with the framework zeolitic oxygens.
Due to the latter interaction, the coordination of the Ga+3 ion
in structure III is rather close to tetrahedral, which is known
to be preferred for Ga+3-containing compounds [40]. Thus,
both attractive interactions provide additional stabilization of
the reactive species III compared with Ga–C2H6 species (I).
Moreover, this facilitates subsequent decomposition of III via
desorption of H2 and formation of the stable tetrahedral gal-
lium in the [H–Ga–C2H5]+ ion (II). The calculated activation
barrier (TS5) for this process is equal to 2 kJ/mol.
To close the catalytic cycle via regeneration of the initial
dihydrido-gallyl ion, the decomposition of the structure II was
proposed by Frash and van Santen to proceed via abstraction
of a hydride ion from the β-position of the ethyl group by the
positively charged gallium atom and simultaneous desorption
of ethylene [Fig. 3, route (a)]. The activation energy for this
process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the
previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol [22] and 254 kJ/mol
[17]. This close agreement indicates that the chemical proper-
ties of the exchanged trivalent gallium species almost do not
depend on the surrounding unless the other atoms of the zeo-
lite are involved in the reaction. However, Table 3 shows that
both the abstracting H atom of the β-methyl group and the
gallium ion are positively charged. Thus, regeneration of the
GaH2+ active site requires “repolarization” of the C–H bond,
a process that appears to be unfavorable. On the other hand,
simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4 [Fig. 3, route (b)],
which results in formation of the univalent gallium ion (Ga
Zd), is about 30 kJ/mol more favorable than closure of the cy-
cle with regeneration of the dihydrido-gallyl ion. Note that this
process is also strongly favored because of the entropy factor.
The calculated Gibbs energy changes (G◦
823) at the conditions
of catalytic reaction (823 K, 1 atm.) are equal to +1 for route (a)
and −74 kJ/mol for route (b).
3.4. Ethane activation over GaH+2
Recently, Joshi and Thomson [22] proposed that the GaH+2
species stabilized in the vicinity of two framework Al atoms
are the active species for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation in
Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts. The initial step of alkane activation over
these active sites was suggested to be a heterolytic dissociation
of the C–H bond via a “carbenium” mechanism, resulting in for-
mation of a “carbenium” ion attached to the basic oxygen of the
zeolite and a hydride ion bonded to gallium (GaH Zd + C2H6
→V) [Fig. 4, route (a)]. In view of earlier results [17,41], this
mechanism seems disputable. Thus, to clarify the mechanism
of alkane activation over GaH+2 species and to compare the re-
activity with those of the earlier discussed gallium containing
sites, the initial activation of ethane over GaH+2 stabilized at
the Zd cluster was computed.
The elementary steps and the reaction energy diagrams for
the “carbenium” and “alkyl” pathways of ethane activation over
GaH Zd cluster are shown in Fig. 4, routes (a) and (b), respec-
tively. The geometry and charge parameters of the interme-
diates and transition state structures involved are summarized
in Table 4. According to Joshi and Thomson [22], activated
molecular adsorption of ethane on GaH+2 species (structure
IV in Fig. 4) precedes C–H bond cleavage. In contrast to the

aforementioned molecular adsorption of C2H6 on Ga Zd and
GaH2 Zd, this process leads to very signiﬁcant changes in
the geometry and charge parameters of both adsorbed C2H6
and the adsorption site. The Ga–O coordination opens (Ga–
O3 and Ga–O4 bonds are broken), and the GaH+2 ion partially
leaves the cation site (5T ring), so that gallium becomes co-
ordinated to only two framework oxygens (O1 and O2). The
coordinative unsaturation of the GaH+2 species is then partially
compensated by interaction with one of the methyl group of
ethane. Formation of such an activated adsorption complex is a
strongly endothermic process (GaH Zd + C2H6 →IV, E =
+68 kJ/mol; Fig. 4), because it requires destruction of a sta-
ble fourfold coordination of GaH by the lattice oxygen atoms.
On the other hand, coordination of ethane to the cation does not

compensate for the energy loss associated with the breaking of
two Ga–O bonds (Ga–O3 and Ga–O4). In other words, it is not
possible to form a strong adsorption complex of ethane with
GaH Zd without decreasing the effective coordination number
of the cation to the basic zeolitic oxygens, as was observed for
Zn+2 ion stabilized in a similar cluster model [32,33]. The dif-
ference with GaH+2 is that the gallium ion in the initial GaH
Zd model is shielded by the attached hydride ion, which hin-
ders the stabilizing charge donation from ethane to the cation.
The twofold coordination of GaH+2 ion in structure IV removes
these hindrances. The effective transfer of electron density from
ethane to the adsorption site is 0.283e−, which is in agree-
ment with the signiﬁcant decrease in the positive charge of the

tensities and simulated IR spectrum (with all DFT computed vibrational fre-
quencies scaled by factor 0.964) for structure IV. The shape of the C–H
vibration mostly perturbed due to interaction with GaH+2 ion is shown by
“balls and sticks” model. IR spectrum of free C2H6 molecule calculated at
B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level is presented for comparison by the dashed line.
GaH+2 ion (Table 4). This indicates appreciable Lewis acidity
of the “activated” GaH+2 ion in a cationic position with dis-
tantly placed aluminum ions. The charge transfer is much larger
(by 0.168e−) than that for ethane adsorption on zinc ions [32],
indicating a much stronger Lewis acidity of low-coordinated
GaH+2 species.
Interaction of the hydrocarbon molecule with the exces-
sively charged low-coordinated monohydrido-gallyl ion results
in very strong polarization of the adsorbed molecule. This is re-
ﬂected in a very strong increase in the negative charge on the
carbon atom (C1) and, at the same time, of the positive charge
on the hydrogen atom (H1) involved in the interaction (Table 4).
In addition, the C1–H1 bond length is 0.038 Å longer than
that of the corresponding value for gas-phase ethane. These
perturbations of the adsorbed molecule affect the vibrational
properties of the C2H6 moiety in structure IV (Fig. 5). One can
see that the calculated IR spectrum of C–H vibrations of IV
contains ﬁve slightly perturbed bands with frequencies close
to those observed in the gas phase, whereas one band is very

strongly red-shifted (by >300 cm−1) and exhibits a very high
relative intensity compared with those of the other C–H stretch-
ing bands. This band corresponds mainly to displacement of the
hydrogen atom (H1) for the C1–H1 bond directly interacting
with the GaH+2 ion. Recently we reported that such a strong
perturbation of adsorbed molecules leads to their subsequent
chemical activation at higher temperatures after the displace-
ment of atoms of the adsorbed molecule corresponding to the
most intense low-frequency infrared band [42]. Thus, the ini-
tially proposed structure for the product of C–H activation of
ethane on GaH Zd was built by displacement of the H1 atom by
1 Å in structure IV following the aforementioned C–H stretch-
ing vibration. Geometry optimization of the resulting structure
leads to formation of product VI of the “alkyl” heterolytic C–H
bond cleavage. The calculated activation energy for this process
[IV →VI; Fig. 4, route (b)] is equal to 104 kJ/mol. The cor-
responding transition state structure TS6 is characterized by an
increase in the “alkyl” C1–H1 bond polarization, resulting in
formation of a proton (H+) attached to the basic zeolitic O atom
and an alkyl (C2H5−) grafted to the gallium ion. The resulting
product, VI, is destabilized due to localization of likely charged
ions (H+ and [H–Ga–C2H5]+) in the immediate vicinity of one
another. However, it can be further stabilized by 195 kJ/mol
via proton transfer from O4 (structure IV) to the more basic O7
ion bounded to the Al2 (structure II). It was shown previously
[34] that the activation energy of this process does not exceed
50 kJ/mol.
It was also found that the product (V) of “carbenium” acti-
vation of C2H6 on GaH Zd is just 14 kJ/mol less stable than
structure VI [Fig. 4 routes (a) and (b), respectively]. Unfortu-
nately, we could not locate the transition-state structure corre-
sponding to the “carbenium” mechanism of ethane activation on
GaH+2 species [IV →V; Fig. 4, route (a)] proposed by Joshi
and Thomson [22]. However, with regard to the above discus-
sion, it is obvious that this process will be less favorable than
the “alkyl” one, because reaction IV →V requires very strong
“repolarization” of the electron density of adsorbed ethane to
produce a negative charge on H1 and a positive charge on the
carbon atom (C1). There do not appear to be any facilitating
factors for this process, and hence we surmise that the “car-
benium” pathway will be strongly disfavored in comparison
with the “alkyl” activation of ethane on charge-compensating
GaH+2 sites.
Thus, the initial activation of C2H6 on GaH Zd results in
formation of the intermediate II, and hence, the catalytic cy-
cle follows the reaction pathway described for ethane dehydro-
genation over Ga Zd (Section 3.2), and GaH+2 is converted to
Ga+.
3.5. Effect of Al–Al distance on the reactivity of Ga+ and
GaH+2 sites
The stability and reactivity of Ga+ and GaH+2 ions in the Zs
cluster model were compared with those for clusters in which
aluminum atoms are separated by a relatively long distance
(8.138 Å). Here we present the computational results of ethane
activation over these ions compensating for the negative charge
in cluster models in which the aluminum ions are placed at the
next-nearest allowed framework positions [Ga Zs and GaH Zs;
r(Al1–Al2) = 4.837 Å]. The intermediates and transition-state
structures thus calculated are very similar to those obtained for
the Zd model and exhibit similar trends in changes of geometry
and charge parameters of intermediates due to chemical conver-
sions. The calculated energetic parameters for elementary steps
of ethane activation on Ga Zs and GaH Zs are summarized in
Table 5.
The activation energies and enthalpies for both the ho-
molytic and heterolytic C–H bond cleavage on Ga+ ion in Zs
clusters are very similar to those calculated for the distantly
separated Al atoms. Thus, it can be concluded that relative
localization of anionic [AlO2]−units in the framework of ze-
olite does not signiﬁcantly affect the reactivity of the charge-
compensating univalent gallium ions. In contrast, the chemical
properties of GaH+2 depend strongly on the Al–Al distance
in the cluster used. Similar to Joshi and Thomson [22], we
could not detect activated molecular adsorption of ethane on
GaH Zs corresponding to the earlier-considered structure IV
(Fig. 4). This is most likely connected to the fact that GaH+2
ion is much more strongly coordinated with the basic lattice
oxygens of Zs than with those of Zd cluster model. Hence, coor-
dination of ethane with the low-coordinated gallium ion cannot
even partially compensate for the loss of energy due to Ga–
O bond breaking, which is necessary for the formation of the
C2H6...GaH+2 activated adsorption complex. This agrees well
with a much higher activation barrier for the “alkyl” C–H bond
dissociation. As follows from Table 5, the energy cost of the re-
82

action (4) is 42 kJ/mol higher in the GaH Zs site than in the
GaH Zd site,
Z−GaH+2Z−+ C2H6 →[H–Ga–C2H5]+Z−+ H+Z-.
(4)
The transition-state structure for the “carbenium” initial acti-
vation of ethane on GaH Zs was not identiﬁed. However, the
enthalpy of this process is equal to +274 kJ/mol; therefore,
the activation energy would be expected to be higher than this
value. This then signiﬁcantly exceeds the value of the activation
energy calculated for the “alkyl” pathway. Taking into account
the results of Section 3.4, the latter process seems to be more fa-
vorable over GaH+2 ions independent of the distance between
charge-compensating [AlO2]−anionic sites.
4. Discussion
In the present study, we considered three possible types of
charge-compensating gallium species in reduced Ga/ZSM-5:
Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2. Stability of univalent species (Ga+,
GaH2+) is remarkably higher than that of GaH+2 in the case of
low Al content in zeolite, that is, distantly separated framework
Al atoms. In contrast, when the Al–Al distance is rather small
(with two aluminums located in the next-nearest positions), the
presence of bivalent ions is preferred in the immediate vicin-
ity of two anionic sites. The repulsive interaction between two
closely situated positively charged univalent species results in
strong destabilization of Ga+ and GaH2+ at such cation sites.
The fraction of cation sites containing two aluminum atoms
in the next-nearest positions is small; for instance, in a zeolite
with an Si:Al ratio of 25, it does not exceed 30% [43]. Thus,
with regard to the results presented in Table 1, it can be con-
cluded that univalent Ga+ or GaH2+ ions are the predominant
charge-compensating species in high-silica gallium-exchanged
zeolites, whereas GaH+2 cations can be found in only a rela-
tively small portion of zeolitic cation sites, which contain two
Al atoms.
It was found that at the initial step of ethane activation, all
of the gallium species considered act as Lewis acids promot-
ing heterolytic C–H cleavage involving the basic oxygen atoms
of the zeolite lattice. In Ga+ and GaH2+ active sites, this re-
sults in the formation of very unstable neutral Ga–C2H5 and
H2Ga–C2H5 species, respectively, as well as a Brønsted acid
site, which readily either oxidizes Ga–C2H5 species or recom-
bines with one of the hydride ions bounded to H2Ga–C2H5,
leading to desorption of hydrogen. In both cases, at the end
of the reaction, very stable [H–Ga–C2H5]+Z−species (II) are
formed.
The catalytic cycle is closed by one-step decomposition of
[H–Ga–C2H5]+Z−. It was found that simultaneous desorption
of H2 and C2H4 from these species [reaction (5)] is the most
favorable process. The activation energy for production of Ga+
from [H–Ga–C2H5]+ following reaction (5) is 33 kJ/mol lower
than that for regeneration of GaH2+ via desorption of ethyl-
ene (6). Moreover, under the conditions of the catalytic process,
due to the entropy factor, the G◦
823 is much lower for reac-
tion (5) than for reaction (6) (−74 vs. +1 kJ/mol),
[H–Ga–C2H5]+Z−→Ga+Z−+ C2H4 + H2
(5)
and
(6)
[H–Ga–C2H5]+Z−→GaH2+Z−+ C2H4.
Indeed, in reaction (5), rotation of the ethyl group results in for-
mation of some weak attractive interaction between an unlikely
charged hydride ion and a H atom from the β-methyl group of
the C2H5−bound to gallium. In contrast, reaction (6) proceeds
via abstraction of a hydride ion by a positively charged gallium
from the same β-methyl group. This process requires signiﬁ-
cant repolarization of the C–H bond involved and thus exhibits
a higher activation barrier. Therefore, ethane dehydrogenation
over dihydrido-gallyl ions results in their decomposition. The
equilibrium concentration of GaH2+ at high temperature is very
low, and hence these sites cannot be considered responsible for
ethane dehydrogenation. This ﬁnding is in agreement with the
recent experimental results [16] indicating decomposition of
GaH2+ ions in the catalytic process.
According to the results presented above on the reactivity of
GaH+2 species, these species do not play a signiﬁcant role as
active sites in the reaction considered. In addition, the mech-
anism of ethane activation proposed by Joshi and Thomson
[22] is disputable. Those authors suggested that gallium in such
species acts as a hydride ion acceptor and that the C–H bond
polarization follows a “carbenium” mechanism (Cδ+–Hδ−);
however, the activated molecular adsorption of ethane, which
precedes C–H cleavage, results in the opposite Cδ−–Hδ+ po-
larization. Note that this ﬁnding is in line with the higher elec-
tronegativity of carbon with respect to hydrogen (2.5 vs. 2.1
in the Pauling scale [44]). It is obvious that subsequent disso-
ciative adsorption of ethane should follow the “alkyl” mecha-
nism leading to formation of the intermediate product [H–Ga–
C2H5]+Z−.
It is also noticeable that the GaH+2 species are isolobal to
Zn+2 ions. This is reﬂected in the similarities of both the geom-
etry and the charge properties of the zeolitic cation sites con-
taining corresponding species (Table 1), as well as their chem-
ical properties. Recently, it was shown experimentally [42,45]
and theoretically [41] that the “alkyl” pathway of hydrocarbon
dehydrogenation over zinc-exchanged zeolites is much more fa-
vorable than the “carbenium” pathway. The same conclusion
follows directly from the calculations presented for GaH+2 ions
exchanged in zeolite independently on the distance between
charge-compensating [AlO2]−framework units. The reactivity
of either Ga+ or GaH2+ in hydrocarbon activation exhibits very
slight dependence on the distribution of aluminum in zeolite. In
contrast, the GaH+2 stabilized in the cation site containing two
anionic sites in the same zeolitic ring is much less active than
that in the “charge-alternating” cation site.
Summarizing the foregoing results, we can conclude that
univalent Ga+ ions at cation sites of high-silica zeolites are
the most probable active species for the hydrocarbon dehy-
drogenation reaction. The apparent activation barrier for this
process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol.
To the best of our knowledge, no experimental data are avail-
able on the activation energies for alkane dehydrogenation over

Ga2O3/HZSM-5 [46] is signiﬁcantly lower (163 kJ/mol) than
this value. This disagreement is most likely due to the imper-
fection of the model used. Indeed, it does not take into account
the electrostatic ﬁeld of the zeolite cage, which can signiﬁ-
cantly stabilize polar transition state structures [47] involved
in this process. Moreover, physical adsorption of ethane (∼20–
30 kJ/mol) due to dispersive interactions between the hydro-
carbon molecule and zeolitic walls, which cannot be correctly
estimated by DFT, also decreases apparent activation energy
compared with the true one.
5. Conclusion
The reaction mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation was in-
vestigated using DFT calculations for various reduced-gallium
sites in Ga/ZSM-5. The probable catalytic cycle starts with the
heterolytic C–H bond cleavage involving exchanged univalent
gallium cation and a basic oxygen atom of the zeolite frame-
work. The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied
s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,
respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for
the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation. Therefore,
heterolytic splitting of the C–H bond is much more favorable
due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hy-
drocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acid–base pair. The result-
ing product easily rearranges to form [H–Ga–C2H5]+, which
decomposes via simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4, re-
generating the initial Ga+ species. The overall activation bar-
rier for C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga+Z−sites is equal to
233 kJ/mol.
Hydrogenated gallium species (GaH2+Z−and Z−GaH+2Z−)
are less likely active sites. Decomposition of the dihydrido-
gallyl ions, resulting in formation of univalent gallium ions
during the catalytic cycle, is signiﬁcantly favored over regen-
eration of GaH2+ sites. In addition, the estimated overall acti-
vation barrier for the considered catalytic reaction is higher (by
58 kJ/mol) for GaH2+ sites than for Ga+ sites.
Bivalent GaH+2 species stabilized at the cation site with dis-
tantly separated framework Al sites exhibit signiﬁcantly higher
initial activity for ethane activation but much lower stability
compared with Ga+ sites. However, initial heterolytic cleav-
age of the C–H bond results in formation of [H–Ga–C2H5]+
ions that preferentially follow the reaction path, again leading
to univalent gallium cations.
On the other hand, GaH+2 ions charge-compensating two
proximate framework aluminum ions are the most stable
cationic species; however, initial activation of the C–H bond
over these sites is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically
and kinetically. In contrast, the reactivity of univalent gallium
species exchanged in zeolite depends only slightly on the rela-
tive position of zeolitic anionic sites ([AlO2]−units).
