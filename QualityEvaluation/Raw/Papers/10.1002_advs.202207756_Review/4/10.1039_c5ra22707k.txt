Hierarchical galloaluminosilicate nanosheets with the MFI structure have been successfully prepared by a 
one-pot hydrothermal process. The tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH), a dual structure-directing 
agent (SDA), was used to simultaneously produce the MFI structure and the self-assemblies of nanolayers. 
The as-synthesized samples were characterized by means of XRD, TEM, SEM, EDS, ICP, 27Al MAS NMR, FTIR, 
H2-TPR, NH3-TPD and N2 physisorption. The galloaluminosilicate nanosheets exhibit the outstanding 
properties, such as an extremely high meso/macroporosity (to be five to six orders of magnitude higher 
compared with the conventional zeolite), a uniform Si, Al and Ga distribution, along with the appropriate 
acidic properties. The galloaluminosilicate nanosheets can greatly enhance the catalytic performances in 
terms of activity (60 and 20% for propane conversion over the hierarchical Ga/HZSM-5 and the conventional 
zeolite, respectively), BTX selectivity (almost three times higher compared with the conventional zeolite), 
and significant reduction of deposited coke (approximately by 70%) for converting of propane at 823 K under 
an atmospheric pressure without any special pre-treatments of catalysts. This first example demonstrates 
the simple and low-cost approach for the synthesis of hierarchical bifunctional zeolite nanosheets and the 
challenging for the development of heterogeneous catalysts. 
Introduction 
Zeolites are regularly the crystalline aluminosilicates with a well-
defined three-dimensional structure. Their crystalline framework 
directly provides the outstanding properties, such as high 
thermal/chemical stabilities, tunable acid-basic properties and 
shape selectivities. As a result, they have played an important role 
in various potential applications ranging from adsorption to 
separation and catalysis.1-5 Due to the microporous feature of 
zeolites, they often suffer from disadvantages, such as low external 
surface areas, low accessible active sites, mass/heat transfer 
limitation and short catalyst lifetime.6 To overcome these 
drawbacks, there are several approaches to be demonstrated, for 
example, making zeolites having nanocrystal sizes, resulting in 
shortening the diffusion path length.7-9 Although the zeolite 
nanocrystals exhibit great external surface areas and provide the 
fast diffusion of guest molecules to accessible active sites,10, 11 the 
zeolite nanocrystals also suffer from an increase of pressure drop in 
a packed-bed reactor and a high cost of the synthesized process 
due to their difficult separation after synthesis or/and reaction 
processes.6 An alternative way to improve the efficiency of 
conventional zeolites is to design the zeolites with hierarchical 
porous structures, namely hierarchical zeolites. These materials 
compose of at least two levels of porosity such as micro-
mesoporous or micro-macroporous or micro-meso-macroporous 
structures. Recently, the hierarchical zeolite nanosheets have been 
successfully prepared by various approaches.12-14 The advantages of 
these materials are not only to greatly decrease diffusion limitation 
due to reducing their diffusion path length, but also to generate a 
secondary porous structure between their layers. This results in the 
addition of the meso/macroporous molecular highway connected 
to the microporous diffusion path providing high accessible active 
sites.   
 
 
In 2009, Choi et al.15 have discovered a new synthetic route 
by using the designed diquaternary ammonium-type surfactant 
(C22H45-N1(CH3)2-C6H12-N1(CH3)2-C6H13) as a structure directing agent 
(SDA) to directly design single-unit-cell MFI nanosheets. The 
diammonium groups control the microporous MFI structure, while a 
long hydrophobic chain forming a micelle structure, resulting in 
preventing the zeolite growth along the b-axis to generate 2D 
zeolite nanolayers. Recently, Wueyi Zhang et al.16 demonstrated the 
synthesis of self-pillared MFI nanosheets by repetitive branching. 
The tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) was also used as a 
bifunctional structure agent controlling the structures of 
microporous MFI and 2D nanolayers, resulting in the formation of a

house of cards structure by repetitive branching of MFI nanosheets. 
Although there are several synthetic approaches to be revealed for 
the preparation of hierarchical MFI nanosheets, there are only a 
few works focusing on the direct synthesis of ZSM-5 nanosheets by 
using a phosphonium structure-directing agent (SDA). This type of 
template also has many advantages, such as its low cost and high 
stability compared with other quaternary ammonium surfactants.17  
In addition to the aluminosilicate zeolites, the incorporation of 
metal atoms to the zeolite framework exhibits the interesting 
properties.18 In particular, the gallium-incorporated zeolites are the 
effective bifunctional catalysts for converting light alkanes to 
aromatics.19 These materials are not only to improve the aromatic 
yield but also to increase the catalyst stability due to a relative 
decrease of acid strength compared with the aluminosilicate 
zeolites. This behavior leads to a significant decrease of coke 
formation.20-22  
 
 
The conversion of propane to high value-added 
aromatic products, such as benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX), 
is an interesting issue in both academic and petrochemical 
industrial points of view.23 Several studies have shown that the 
bifunctional gallium loaded HZSM-5 is one of the most suitable 
catalysts for aromatization of propane.23-25 The Ga species 
have played an important role for the dehydrogenation of 
propane to propylene, while the Brønsted acid sites of zeolite 
promote the oligomerization of olefins and the subsequent 
aromatization to produce the aromatics.26-29 Typically, the 
Ga/ZSM-5 has been prepared by the post synthesis treatment, 
such as an impregnation, and an ion-exchange. The gallium 
species obtained by these two methods are not active without 
a special treatment. In addition, the gallium species are 
aggregated on external surfaces of zeolites, resulting in losing 
of the catalytic activity.28,30 In contrast, the Ga/HZSM-5 
obtained from an in-situ hydrothermal method gives a higher 
aromatic yield for the aromatization of light alkanes due to 
highly dispersed active gallium species in close vicinity to 
Brønsted acid sites.31-33 However, it often suffers from the fast 
deactivation of catalysts.  This might be the relatively large 
amount of deposited coke on surfaces.25,34-36  
 
 
To improve the efficiency of catalysts for converting 
propane to aromatics, Yassir et al.37 reported the benefits of 
mesoporous galloaluminosilicates for the aromatization of 
propane. Hierarchical Ga/HZSM-5 was prepared by three-step 
modifications, involving the direct-hydrothermal synthesis of 
conventional Ga/HZSM-5, the steaming of the obtained 
zeolites and the subsequent hydrolysis of steam–treated 
zeolites in the presence of surfactant to generate the 
mesoporous feature. Recently, Ogunronbi et al.38 reported the 
synthesis of the hierarchical Ga-containing HZSM-5 zeolite by a 
top-down post-synthesis method (e.g., desilication, alkaline 
treatment, CTAB-mediated assembly of Ga-containing zeolite 
seed into MCM-41 mesostructure, etc.). Although there are 
some reports describing the synthesis of mesoporous 
galloaluminosilicates, most of them have focused on the post 
synthesis treatment, 
which requires several steps of 
preparation. To date, the design of the galloaluminosilicate 
with hierarchical nanosheet structure has not yet been 
demonstrated.                      
In the present study, we report the synthesis of 
hierarchical galloaluminosilicate nanosheets with the MFI 
framework by a one-pot hydrothermal method.  The tetra(n-
butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) was used as a dual 
functional template to simultaneously control both the MFI 
structure and hierarchical nanosheet assemblies. This first 
example of the hierarchical Ga/HZSM-5 nanosheets, obtained 
by a one-step synthesis method without any special 
treatments, exhibits an excellent catalytic application for 
converting propane to aromatics (BTX) in terms of activity, 
selectivity and catalyst lifetime. 
Experimental  
Catalyst Preparation 
 
 
MFI-type 
galloaluminosilicate 
nanosheets 
were 
hydrothermally 
synthesized 
by 
using 
a 
tetra(n-
butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) as the SDA. The molar 
composition of the synthesis gel was 60SiO2/ 0.40Al2O3/ 
0.60Ga2O3/ 18TBPOH/ 0.75NaOH/ 240EtOH/ 600H2O. In a 
typical procedure, the first solution containing 0.0530 g of 
aluminum isopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 98.0%), 0.0343 g of 
gallium nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) and 8.6780 g of 
tetraethyl 
orthosilicate 
(Sigma-Aldrich, 
≥ 
99.0%) 
was 
prepared. The second solution containing 8.6250g of TBPOH 
solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 40% in H2O) and 0.200 g of sodium 
hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98.0%) in 2.3250 g of distilled 
water was added into the first solution under vigorous stirring. 
The resultant gel was continuously stirred at room 
temperature for 12 h to obtain a homogenous mixture. The 
obtained gel was transferred to a Teflon lined stainless steel 
autoclave and heated at 403 K for 48 h. The precipitated 
product was collected and washed with distilled water by 
repeated centrifugation until the pH of filtrate less than 9. The 
product was dried overnight at 373 K, and then finally calcined 
in air at 923 K for 8 h to remove the SDA. The synthesized 
product was converted to the H+ form by an ion-exchange with 
1 M NH4NO3 solution at 353 K for three times. The obtained 
solid was dried and finally calcined in air at 923 K for 6 h. The 
obtained MFI-type galloaluminosilicate nanosheet is denoted 
as the Ga-HZSM-5-NS. The MFI-type aluminosilicate nanosheet 
(HZSM-5-NS) was synthesized without the addition of gallium 
precursor by following the literature procedures.16 The 
conventional MFI-type galloaluminosilicate (Ga-HZSM-5-CON) 
was synthesized by using TPAOH as the SDA and the gel 
precursor was crystallized at 453 K for 3 d. The molar 
composition of a synthesis gel is 10SiO2/ 0.05Al2O3/ 
0.10Ga2O3/ 1TPAOH/ 1.03NaOH/ 240EtOH/ 400H2O. The 
obtained product was filtered, washed with DI water and dried 
at 373 K overnight. Finally, the product was calcined at 923 K 
for 8 h to remove the SDA. The conventional MFI-type 
aluminosilicate (HZSM-5-CON) was obtained by the similar 
procedure in the absence of the gallium precursor. 
 
Catalyst Characterization 
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-
synthesized samples were investigated by using a Bruker D8 
ADVANCE diffractometer and CuKα radiation (30 kV, 40 mA) with 
step size of 0.02 and scan rate of 1° min-1. The relative crystallinity 
of synthesized samples was estimated based on the intensity of the 
peaks of 2θ = 22-25. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images 
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded 
by the JEOL JSM-7600F (at 2 kV) and JEOL JEM-2010 microscope 
operated at 200 kV, respectively.  The composition and elemental 
distribution of synthesized samples were measured by an 
inductively coupled plasma analysis, ICP-OES, using a model Agilent 
technologies 715 and an energy dispersive spectroscopy, EDS,

respectively. 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy performed on an 
AVANCE 300 MHZ Digital NMR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin; 
DPX-300) was used to investigate the nature of aluminium species. 
The 
textural 
properties 
were 
determined 
by 
a 
N2 
adsorption/desorption technique at 77 K performed on a 
Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus. The specific surface area (SBET), 
micropore surface area and pore volume, mesopore size 
distribution were calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) 
method, t-plot method and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model, 
respectively.39  
 
The H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) 
and NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) 
measurements were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor system 
equipped with a TCD detector. Typically, the samples (0.3 g) 
were pre-treated at 823 K for 2 h with heating rate of 10 K/min 
under the flow of N2 and then cooled down to a desired 
temperature. In the case of the H2-TPR experiments, the 
temperature was increased from 323 to 1173 K with the 
heating rate of 5 K/min in a flow of 2v/v% of H2 in Ar (5 
ml/min). In the NH3-TPD experiment, the sample was 
equilibrated with 5% of NH3 in He for 30 min at 323 K and then 
purged with He for 1 h to remove the weak adsorbed NH3. The 
NH3 TPD profiles were recorded by increasing the temperature 
from 323 K to 1073 K with the heating rate of 5 K/min in the 
flow of He (30 ml/min). 
 
 Propane Aromatization  
 
 
The conversion of propane to aromatics was carried out 
in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor. A 0.3 g of catalyst was 
placed into the reactor. Prior to the catalytic studies, zeolite 
samples were activated at 823 K in the flow of N2 (2.5 ml/min) 
for 2 h. The feed was the propane in N2 with the molar volume 
ratio of 1:1. All reactions were carried out at 823 K, GHSV (gas 
hourly space velocity) of 300 h-1, and atmospheric pressure. 
The analysis of the reaction mixtures was performed by an on-
line gas chromatograph (GC) (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a 
FID detector and a GS-GASPRO capillary column (60 m x 0.320 
mm) at an interval time of 1 h. The mass balance was checked 
for all experiments (98.65 ± 1.32%). The conversion of feed 
(Xfeed) and product selectivity (Si) are reported in the mole 
percentage and calculated by the following equations: 
    
                         X feed(%) = (
Ai −Aunreacted _ feed
∑

                             Si(%) = (

∑
)×100% 
Where ΣAi and Aunreacted_feed are the corrected chromatographic 
areas of species i and remaining propane, respectively. 
Results and Discussions 
 
 
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of all as-synthesized 
samples. The characteristic diffraction patterns of HZSM-5-NS 
and HZSM-5-CON were identical to the typical reflection 
characteristic of the MFI framework structure, confirming that 
the synthesized aluminosilicates compose of a highly 
crystalline MFI framework without the contamination of any 
other crystalline phases. Ga-containing samples (Ga-HZSM-5-
NS and Ga-HZSM-5-CON) also were the highly crystalline MFI. 
The relative crystallinity of Ga-containing samples was slightly 
higher compared with that of the corresponding HZSM-5 
samples. In addition, no XRD characteristic peaks assigned to 
be the bulk β-Ga2O3 was observed in the MFI-type 
galloaluminosilicates, implying that the Ga species appear as 
highly-dispersed species in the form of either gallium oxide 
species with small size (< 4 nm) or the Ga framework.40

The 
scanning 
electron 
micrographs 
reveal 
the 
morphologies of as-synthesized samples (Fig. 2). According to 
the conventional zeolite samples, cubic-shaped crystals with 
particle sizes of 368±36 and 412±32.5 nm were observed for 
the HZSM-5-CON and the Ga-HZSM-5-CON, respectively (see 
the particle size distribution in Fig. S1(a-b) in Supporting 
Information). In strong contrast to this, the spherical 
assemblies of ZSM-5 nanolayers were observed in the case of 
the HZSM-5-NS and the Ga-HZSM-5-NS. The particle size 
distribution of their assemblies and the nanosheet thickness 
are shown in Fig. S1(c-d) and Fig. S2(a-b) in the Supporting 
Information, respectively. The particle size and the nanosheet 
thickness of the galloaluminosilicate nanosheets insignificantly 
change compared with the aluminosilicate nanosheets.  This 
indicates that the gallium incorporation into the zeolite 
framework does not change the morphologies of zeolites.

The TEM images of the Ga-HZSM-5-NS also confirm 
their highly uniform particle size distributions (Fig. 3(a) for 
TEM images of the Ga-HZSM-5-NS). The HRTEM reveals that 
the Ga-HZSM-5-NS composes of the house of cards structure 
of zeolite nanolayers with the nanosheet thickness of 9.81 nm 
and the lattice fringes also confirm the presence of the 
polycrystalline structure in the assemblies of nanolayers (Fig. 
3(b) and Fig. S2(a-b) in Supporting Information).

resolution TEM images of the Ga-HZSM-5-NS. The inset 
in (b) is the selected-area-diffraction (SAD) pattern of 
the high-resolution image. 
 
The elemental composition of Si, Al and Ga and their 
distributions of the Ga-HZSM-5-NS were obtained by ICP-OES 
and EDS mapping as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4. The 
SiO2/Al2O3 and Ga/(Al+Ga) ratios obtained by ICP-OES of all as-
synthesized samples are approximately by 63 and 0.72, 
respectively, which are similar to the values obtained by the 
EDS analysis (72 and 0.77 for SiO2/Al2O3 and Ga/(Al+Ga), 
respectively). In addition, the EDS elemental mapping of Si, Al 
and Ga elements shows the highly uniform distribution of all 
elements over the entire particle areas.

Si, (b) Al and (c) Ga elements. 
 
 
The textural properties of the synthesized samples were 
investigated by the N2 physisorption technique as shown in 
Table 1. The N2 sorption isotherms of the HZSM-5-CON and the 
Ga-HZSM-5-CON correspond to a type I isotherm because of 
the micropore filling41 (Fig. S3A (a-b) in the Supporting 
Information). In contrast, the HZSM-5-NS and the Ga-HZSM-5-
NS exhibit the combination of the type I isotherm at low 
relative P/P0 and the hysteresis loop at high P/P0 due to a 
capillary condensation within mesopores and macropores 
(Fig.S3A (c-d) in the Supporting Information). The pore size 
distribution (PSD) data derived from the BJH adsorption 
branch of isotherm reveal a broad distribution of mesopores in 
the range between 5 and 15 nm (Fig.S3B in the Supporting 
Information). 
This 
behaviour 
indicates 
that 
both 
aluminosilicate and galloaluminosilicate nanosheets compose 
of the micropororous feature due to zeolite characteristics and 
mesopores/macropores obtained from the assemblies of 
nanolayers and the interparticle voids. This makes it clear that 
external surface areas and meso/macropore volumes of the 
HZSM-5- NS and Ga-HZSM-5-NS can be five to six orders of 
magnitude higher compared with the conventional zeolites. 
This demonstrates that the designed hierarchical zeolites 
increase the meso/macroporosity, while the microporosity is 
significantly preserved.  
        The nature of aluminium active sites was investigated 
by 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy as shown in Fig. S4 in the 
Supporting Information. A strong peak at the chemical shift 
about 52.3 ppm, assigned to the tetrahedral coordinated 
aluminium in frameworks, was observed, whereas no 
characteristic peak of the octahedrally coordinated extra-
framework aluminum species appeared at the chemical shift of 
0 ppm. It clearly confirms that the aluminium atoms are most 
likely to occupy as the Al-substituted zeolite framework, 
whereas the presence of the extra-framework aluminum 
species can be omitted even in the galloaluminosilicate 
samples. This shows that the dealumination was not observed 
by the Ga incorporation to the zeolite framework during the 
crystallization. 
Fig. 5 shows H2 TPR curves and NH3 TPD profiles.  
According to the H2 TPR profiles, the three major peaks are 
observed for the Ga-HZSM-5-NS nanosheets. The first and 
second peaks at c.a. 833-843 K and c.a. 923-933 K correspond 
to 
the 
reduction 
of 
well-dispersed 
Ga2O3 
or 
GaO+ 
extraframework. The reduction peak at high temperature (c.a. 
1023-1033 °C) can be attributed to the segregated bulk Ga2O3 
particles.32 In contrast, the Ga-HZSM-5-CON exhibits the 
characteristic peaks at higher temperature, indicating that the 
Ga species in the conventional MFI-type galloaluminosilicate 
agglomerate into larger Ga2O3 particles or preferably situated 
on the outermost surfaces of the zeolite. The acidity of 
synthesized nanosheets was investigated by the NH3 TPD. 
There are three major desorption peaks at 513, 588, and 648 K 
assigned to weak, medium and strong acid sites, respectively. 
With the incorporation of Ga in the zeolite framework, the 
desorption-peak is shifted to lower temperature, indicating 
lower acid strength of the Ga-HZSM-5-NS compared with the 
HZSM-5-NS. In addition, the amount of strong acid sites of the 
galloaluminosilicate decreases approximately by 6% compared 
with that of the HZSM-5.  
To illustrate the benefits of the Ga-HZSM-5-NS, the 
conversion of propane to aromatics was studied as the model 
reaction. Fig. 6A demonstrates the conversion of propane as a 
function of time-on-stream (TOS). The low activity of propane 
conversion was observed for the HZSM-5-CON. As expected, 
the hierarchical MFI nanosheets can significantly enhance the 
propane conversion. Compared with the HZSM-5-CON, the 
catalytic activity of the HZSM-5-NS is higher approximately by 
1.5 times. Interestingly, the Ga-HZSM-5-NS exhibits the 
excellent catalytic activity, which can be three orders of 
magnitude higher compared with another samples. Not only 
the improved catalytic activity, but also the enhanced 
selectivity of aromatics (BTX) was observed for the MFI-type 
galloaluminosilicate nanosheets.

         Fig. 6B shows the product selectivity at 24 h of TOS. It 
clearly shows that the aluminosilicate samples (HZSM-5-CON 
and HZSM-5-NS) promote the catalytic cracking reaction of 
propane to produce C1 and C2 as the main products, whereas 
the aromatic yield is very low. However, the dehydro-
cyclization of propane is significantly enhanced by the 
incorporation of Ga in the MFI structure, resulting in an 
increase of aromatics and propylene.   
 
         This makes it clear that gallium species play an 
important role in the dehydrogenation of propane to yield the 
propylene, which is the important intermediate for the further 
oligomerization and the subsequent cyclization. This could 
eventually lead to an increased selectivity of the propylene 
and aromatics (almost 75%) over the Ga-HZSM-5-NS.

To further explain the effect of the hierarchical structure on 
propane conversion, the amount of deposited coke was also 
measured by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as shown in Fig. 
S5. The TGA curves of all catalysts exhibit two main-weight-loss 
peaks. The peak at 373 K is due to H2O removal, whereas the peak 
at 723 K is due to the carbon decomposition. The carbon weight 
loss over the HZSM-5-CON, the Ga-HZSM-5-CON, the HZSM-5-NS 
and the Ga-HZSM-5-NS is 18.53, 17.61, 17.16 and 5.35%, 
respectively. This result suggests that the Ga-HZSM-5-NS not only 
enhances the catalytic performances in terms of activity and 
BTX/propylene selectivity, but also reduces the amount of 
deposited coke, which probably causes the catalyst deactivation.

performances of propane conversion without any special pre-
treatments. This opens up interesting perspectives for the 
development of bifunctional catalysts with hierarchical structure 
obtained by a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis for the potential 
applications, especially in the petrochemical reactions. 
 
Conclusions 
 
 
Hierarchical MFI-type galloaluminosilicate nanosheets 
have been successfully prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal 
synthesis. The TBPOH was used as a dual structure-directing 
agent (SDA) to simultaneously control the MFI structure and 
the self-assemblies of nanolayers. They also exhibit the 
outstanding properties, such as a high meso/macroporosity 
with the significant amount of microporosity, a uniform Si, Al 
and Ga distribution, along with an interesting acidic properties 
compared 
with 
the 
corresponding 
aluminosilicate. 
Interestingly, 
they 
also 
show 
the 
excellent 
catalytic 
performances in terms of activity, BTX and propylene 
selectivity as well as a significant reduction of deposited coke, 
for converting of propane without any special pretreatments. 
This can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the suitable 
acidity due to the Ga incorporation and the hierarchical 
structure due to the added meso/macroporous molecular 
highway, which improves the accessibility of guest molecules 
into active sites. This first example demonstrates the design of 
novel hierarchical galloaluminosilicates by a simple and low-
cost approach and it also opens up interesting perspectives for 
the applications of heterogeneous catalysis in petrochemical 
processes.
