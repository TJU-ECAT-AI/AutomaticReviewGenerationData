Co-based catalysts are promising alternatives to replace Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for propane dehydro-
genation (PDH) in view of the catalytic activity for C–H bond activation, low cost, and low toxicity.
However, the reduction of unstable CoOx species and coke deposition cause serious catalyst deactivation.
In this work, a sheet-shaped Co–Al2O3 catalyst comprising of isolate Co2+ sites shows a high intrinsic
activity (speciﬁc reaction rate > 16 mmol g1 h1) and catalytic stability in highly selective PDH reaction
(>97% C3H6 selectivity). Extensive characterization demonstrates that the tetrahedral Co2+ isolated site is
stabilized by the c-Al2O3 matrix, facilitating propylene desorption to inhibit formation of coke and other
byproducts and to free the active Co sites.

1. Introduction
Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of
a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide,
acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [1–4]. The increasing global
demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas
deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane
dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene. The commercial
PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies,
the Oleﬂex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catoﬁn pro-
cess with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst [5]. For Pt-based catalysts, the elec-
tronic modiﬁcation by promoters and the speciﬁc interaction
with the optimized supports lead to the enhancement in both cat-
alytic activity and stability [6–11]. However, the high price of Pt
metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict
the further development of the PDH process. Development of
cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-,
Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic
challenge [12–24].
Low-coordinate cobalt species (Co+/Co2+) are known to be efﬁ-
cient in C–H activation for hydrocarbons [25]. It has been reported
that the oxygen-deﬁcient cobalt/oxygen cluster ions could accom-
plish the dehydrogenation of isobutane via the insertion into the
C–H bond with formation of the [CoxOx-1C4H8]+ intermediates
[26]. The isotopic labelling kinetics of Co+-catalyzed C–H and C–C
activation of C3H8 show a remarkable dependence on the elec-
tronic state of Co+ cation adducts [27]. The activation of C–H and
C–C bonds and H2/CH4 elimination favored the Co+ with the
exited-state rather than with the ground-state [28]. Co2+ ion-
exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst is capable of C3H8 activation;
however it also reveals fast reaction rates of C–C cracking path-
ways [29,30]. Nearly 80% propylene selectivity could be obtained
on a mesoporous CoAl2O4 spinel catalyst in the PDH reaction,
whereas the rapid deactivation was observed [31]. The optimal cat-
alytic performance of 21.5% C3H6 yield was achieved on a 5 wt% Co/
Al2O3 catalyst [32]. Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory C3H6 selectivity
of 83.6% indicated that the co-existence of the diverse Co active
sites on the surface of Al2O3 support that caused signiﬁcant side
reactions. This is partly due to the lacking of structure-control on
the Co sites. Modiﬁed spinel Co3O4 has shown good activity in
the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, however, it can
be easily reduced to metallic Co0 species during the anaerobic
PDH
reaction,

signiﬁcant methane and C2 molecules [33,34]. Therefore, exposure
of stabilized and active surface Co sites with a single state still
remain as a key challenge for facilitating both catalytic selectivity
and stability in Co-catalyzed PDH reaction [35].
Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heteroge-
neous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability. For
instance, the coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites present on the
(100) facets of commercial c-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites to
anchor atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites [36,37]. The speciﬁc
interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral
Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type c-Ga2O3-Al2O3
solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in
PDH reaction [38]. The c-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-
coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse
and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong
interactions between metals and support [39]. This PtSn/Al2O3
sheet catalyst displayed an excellent performance at an ultrahigh
space velocity in a long-term PDH reaction. In addition to being
an appropriate support, the hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3
showed a high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as the sur-
face active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to
isobutylene [40]. Furthermore, the diversity and complexity on the
structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-
coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the
adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition
in the PDH reaction. It is therefore desirable to tailor the structure
of Co2+ and Al2O3 composites for improving the catalytic perfor-
mance in the PDH reaction.
Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to syn-
thesize sheet-shaped Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts for efﬁciently catalyz-
ing the PDH reaction. The structural and catalytic stabilities as well
as the Co–Al2O3 interaction for these catalysts are benchmarked to
an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. We further illustrate the
effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in the Co-catalyzed PDH
reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The c-Al2O3 sheets were synthesized according to a previously
reported hydrothermal procedure with minor modiﬁcations. The
formation of the shaped boehmite (c-AlO(OH)) precursor with
the aid of urea is regard as the key to control the sheet-like mor-
phology of the resultant catalysts [41]. 6.44 g of Al(NO3)39H2O
and 9.4 g of urea (CO(NH2)2) were dissolved in 190 mL of deionized
water to form a homogeneous solution under vigorous stirring for
15 min. The solution with a pH of approximately 4 was transferred
into a Teﬂon-lined stainless autoclave and then maintained at
100 C for 48 h. After natural cooling, the white precipitate was ﬁl-
tered and then washed with deionized water and anhydrous alco-
hol several times. The powder was dried at 100 C overnight and
calcined in air at 600 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 1 C/min
to obtain the c-Al2O3 sheets.
All Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts were prepared using the same
hydrothermal procedure except of the addition of Co precursor
salt. Urea was used as the precipitating agent and the certain molar
ratio of Co and Al was adjusted by changing the dosages of Co
(NO3)26H2O and Al(NO3)39H2O. Typically, the molar ratio of urea
to total metals (Co+Al) was approximately 9:1. The synthesis of
5 wt% Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst as the reference catalyst was followed
the incipient wetness impregnation method. The diluted Co(NO3)2
solution was incipient impregnated into the c-Al2O3 sheet support.
The sample was maintained at room temperature for 2 h and then
dried at 70 C overnight. All the Co catalysts were ﬁnally obtained
by the calcination in air at 600 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 C/
min.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Ultraviolet–visible
diffuse
reﬂectance
(UV–Vis–DR)
spectra
were recorded from 250 to 900 nm on a Lambda 950 spectrometer
(PerkinElmer) equipped with a 150 mm integrating sphere. X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected between 10 and 80 in
2h value on a Bruker AXS D8 Focus diffractrometer with Cu Ka
radiation (k = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analyses were performed on a JEOL JEM 3010
instrument operated at 300 kV. Scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental
mapping were carried out on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN system
operated at 200 kV. The metal ratios of Co/Al in all catalysts were
quantiﬁed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission
spectrometry (ICP-OES, Avio 200, PerkinElmer). Thermo gravimet-
ric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a TGA 2 (Mettler Toledo) with
a raising rate of 10 C/min in air for coke measurement.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained
on an Escalab250Xi electron spectrometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc) with
monochromatic 150 W Al Ka radiation, and the binding energy was
referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The peak ﬁtting is on the
basis of the constraints as follow: the two doublet peaks and the
two satellite peaks have the equal peak width, respectively. The
Co 2p3/2 level peak with a binding energy (BE) of 780.9–781.7 eV
and the Co 2p1/2 level peak with a BE of 795–706 eV are the char-
acteristic of the octahedral Co3+ species of Co3O4. The Co 2p3/2 level
peak with a BE of 779.5–780.3 eV and the Co 2p1/2 level peak with a
BE of 795–706 eV are attributed to the tetrahedral Co2+ species.
27Al magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS
NMR) spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance III 400 equipped
with 89 mm wide-bore 9.4 T superconducting magnets in 4 mm
rotors at Larmor frequencies of 104.3 MHz. Single pulse 27Al MAS
NMR spectrum was acquired at a spinning speed of 14 kHz and
1.0 s recycle delay. 27Al chemical shifts were referenced to 1 M
Al(NO3)3 at 0 ppm.
Ex-situ Co K-edge extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure
(EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) exper-
iments were performed in transmission mode on the XAFCA beam-
line of the Singapore Synchrotron Light Source. The collected data
was analyzed by by the IFEFFIT software package package follow
the standard protocol [42]. EXAFS oscillations v(k) were extracted
from normalized spectrum and then Fourier transformation was
performed in Athena to obtain k2-weighted r-space data. The r-
space spectra were ﬁtted in Artemis. The ﬁtting window in k space
is 3–11 Å1 while in r-space is 1–3 Å. The amplitude reduction fac-
tor So
2 was obtained from the ﬁtting for Co foil, assuming the coor-
dination number of the ﬁrst shell scattering atoms is 12. Then So
2
was constrained as a constant in the following data ﬁtting for the
Co K edge spectrum from samples. The coordination number
(CN), distance and Debye-Waller factor (r2) were used as ﬁtting
variables.
Temperature programmed analyses were performed on a
chemisorption analyzer (AutoChem 2920, Micromeritics) with a
thermal conductivity detector (TCD) or a mass spectrometry (MS)
detector (QGA, Hiden Analytical Ltd.). For temperature pro-
grammed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR), 150 mg of sample
was pretreated at 400 C for 2 h and cooled down to 100 C under
30 mL/min of Ar stream. The sample was reduced by a 10% H2/Ar
mixture gas (30 mL/min) in the temperature range of 100–900 C
at a heating rate of 10 C/min for the signal recording. For temper-
ature programmed desorption of propylene (C3H6-TPD), 50 mg of
catalyst was pretreated in Ar (30 mL/min) at 400 C for 120 min
and cooled to 50 C. Subsequent absorption of propylene gas

(99.99%, 10 mL/min) was lasted for 30 min and the system was
then purged with Ar for 60 min. The catalyst was heated to
900 C at a constant rate of 10 C/min in Ar to collect the signal.
50 mg of sample was used in temperature programmed desorption
of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and ﬁrst pretreated in Ar stream (30 mL/
min) at 400 C for 120 min. When the catalyst cooled to 50 C,
NH3 was adsorbed for 30 min with 10% NH3/N2 (20 mL/min) and
the gas was then switched to Ar to remove the physically absorbed
NH3. The signal of NH3-desorption was recorded with heating sam-
ple at a rate of 10 C/min in 30 mL/min of Ar.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Catalytic PDH reaction was performed on a ﬁxed-bed reactor
under atmospheric pressure. The inner diameter of the quartz
tubular reactor is 10 mm. Catalyst (0.15 g) with 30–60 mesh was
diluted with 0.15 g of quartz sand, loaded in the middle of the reac-
tor. The catalyst was pretreated in N2 from room temperature to
590 C at 15 C/min and kept for 30 min for reaching the steady
state and removing the impurities. For the PDH reaction, the molar
ratio of C3H8:H2:N2 was 1:0.8:3.2 with the total ﬂow rate of 20 mL/
min. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was
2.9 h1. To study the diffusion effect, 0.15 g or 0.30 g of catalyst
with 40–50 mesh and varied ﬂow rates were used. Based on the
calculation result by ChemOfﬁce software, the thermodynamical
equilibrium conversion was 51.5% under used reaction conditions.
An online gas chromatograph equipped a TCD detector channel
with a 3 m TDX-1 column and a ﬂame ionization detector (FID)
channel with a KB-Al2O3 capillary column (60 m  0.32 mm  10
mm) was used to analyze the products including N2, C3H8, C3H6,
C2H4, C2H6, C2H2, CH4, CO and CO2. The conversion of propane,
selectivity to propylene, and turnover frequency (TOFCo) were
determined from the following equations:

where i represents the hydrocarbon products in the efﬂuent gas, ni

ing ﬂow rate, t is the reaction time, nin(C3H8) is the total number of
C3H8 in the feeding gases, and NCo is the number of total Co atoms in
the catalyst. If we convert the coke weights to reacted C3H8 moles,
the contribution of coke is less than 0.05% in all cases. Therefore, the
effect of coke on the evaluation of catalytic performances is ignored
in this work.
For the coke removal and the catalyst regeneration in recycling
tests, the reused catalyst was oxidized in 30 mL/min of O2 at
500 C, and then purged in 30 mL/min of N2 or post-reduced in
30 mL/min of H2 at 590 C.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structures of Al2O3 sheets supported Co catalysts
Two kinds of Co-based catalysts on c-Al2O3 sheets, Co–Al2O3–
HT and Co/Al2O3-IMP, are prepared by one-step hydrothermal
procedure and incipient witness impregnation, respectively. The
similar Co loadings with approximately 5 wt% for both catalysts
are clariﬁed with ICP-OES results. The structural differences
between these two Co catalysts are ﬁrstly investigated using
detailed characterizations.
The TEM images reveal the sheet-like morphology for these two
catalysts. Individual nanoparticles with 5 nm disperse on the Al2O3
sheets for Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, as shown in Fig. 1A. Nonetheless,
only nanosheets with <6 nm in thickness but no nanoparticles are
found in Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst (Figs. 1B and S1 in Supporting
Information). Highly homogeneous distribution of Co, Al and O ele-
ments in Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst is further demonstrated by EDX
elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 1C-F). This results indicate that
the one-step hydrothermal synthesis added with Co salt cannot
change the sheet-like shape of Al2O3 matrix. The BET surface areas
of bare Al2O3 support and two Co catalysts are also measured and

listed in Table 1. A slightly decreased surface area is obtained on
Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst (174 m2 g1) compared to Al2O3 support
(226 m2 g1) and Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst (230 m2 g1), due to the
impregnated deposition of Co3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of
Al2O3 sheets.
The UV–Vis–DR spectra (Fig. 2A) provide the structural infor-
mation of Co species in these two catalysts. A board absorption
band with the maximum peaks at approximately 543, 578 and
630 nm are observed on Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst, which are associ-
ated
with m3

transition
characteristic
of
the
pseudo-tetrahedral Co2+ species [43,44]. For Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst,
the peaks of Co2+ species are insigniﬁcant, and broad adsorption
bands at ca. 405 and 690 nm are emerged. These two bands are
assigned to the ligand-metal charge-transfer of O2– ?Co2+ and
O2– ?Co3+ in spinal Co3O4, which is agreement with the pattern
of the reference sample of commercial Co3O4 particles (Fig. S2).
This result suggests the existence of Co3O4 phase on the Al2O3 sur-
face in Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst [45,46].
Fig. 2B shows representative XRD patterns of as-prepared Al2O3
sheet support, Co–Al2O3–HT and Co/Al2O3-IMP catalysts, and
Table S1 in Supporting Information summarizes the comparative
results. The diffraction peaks of Al2O3 sheet support match well
with
the
pattern
of
c-Al2O3
phase
(PDF#29-0063).
For
Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst, no signiﬁcant peak shift is observed (<0.1
shifts compared to c-Al2O3 phase), and neither metallic Co0 phase
nor Co oxide is found, implying high dispersion of isolate Co sites.
For Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, the peak shift toward low-angle is
obviously observed. For instance, the peak positions of 31.2,
36.7 and 59.4 are markedly lower than 32.0, 37.2 and 60.5
which are corresponding to (220), (311) and (511) peaks of c-
Al2O3 support, respectively. The position of these peaks of Co/
Al2O3-IMP
catalyst
is
close
to
that
of
spinel
Co3O4
phase
(PDF#78-1970) and CoAl2O4 phase (PDF#44-0160). Although these
two phases have similar characteristic diffraction peaks, we expect
that Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst consists of c-Al2O3 phase coexisted with
Co3O4 particles rather than with CoAl2O4 species. The conclusion is
supported by the following experimental evidences. A weak peak
at 55.6 is exclusively observed on the pattern of Co/Al2O3-IMP cat-
alyst, which is assignment to the (422) plane of Co3O4 phase
(Fig. 2B and Table S1). The UV–Vis spectrum of Co/Al2O3-IMP cat-
alyst displays a typical Co3O4 pattern but not the feature of spinel
CoAl2O4 with Co2+ ions. The high dispersion of nanoparticles,
which is conﬁrmed by the TEM images, also suggests that the Co
atoms cannot completely embed into Al2O3 matrix to form CoAl2-
O4 structure. Therefore, Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst possesses separated
phases of Co3O4 nanoparticles and c-Al2O3 sheets.
Fig. 3A presents the XPS spectra of Co 2p electronic levels in two
Co catalysts. No peaks corresponding to the metallic Co0 state is
observed on both Co catalysts. All Co 2p core-level spectra are
deconvoluted into four individual contributions, including two
spin-orbit doublets of Co2+ and Co3+ at Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, as well
as two satellite peaks. The peak ﬁtting results suggest that the Co
species on the Co–Al2O3–HT surface mainly exist as Co2+ state
(Co2+/Co3+ = 92/8). The Co3+ species dominates over the Co2+

species on the Co/Al2O3-IMP surface with the Co2+/Co3+ratio of
44/56 that is slightly higher than that in spinel Co3O4 (Table 1).
The XANES analyses (Fig. 3B) of these two Co catalysts provide
the information on the oxidation state and the geometry of the Co
sites. The Co K-edge pattern of Co–Al2O3–HT is close to the CoO but
far from the Co3O4 reference. A pre-edge peak located at 7709.4 eV
and a shoulder peak located at 7719.3 eV are also observed, which
are typically corresponding to the tetrahedral coordination of Co2+
in CoAl2O4 structure [33,47]. In contrast, the photon energy at Co
K-edge in Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst shifts to a higher value, and the
peak energy reaches 7729.0 eV, which is identical to that of
Co3O4 standard sample. The pre-edge peak at 7710.1 eV suggests
the octahedral environment of Co3+ sites in Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst
[48].
The 27Al MAS NMR spectra after the normalization with the
intensity (Fig. 3C) provides the coordination of Al3+ species in var-
ious catalysts. The signals of both tetrahedral Al3+ (Al3+
tetra, at
63 ppm) and octahedral Al3+ (Al3+
oct, at 5 ppm) coexist in the spectra
[36,37,49]. As summarized in Table 1, the ratio of Al3+
tetra to Al3+
oct in Co/
Al2O3-IMP catalyst is comparable to that in bare c-Al2O3 sheet sup-
port, indicating that the deposition of Co3O4 species do not affect the
intrinsic crystal structure as well as the coordination distribution of
c-Al2O3. However, the relatively lower ratio of Al3+
tetra to Al3+
oct is
obtained on Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst, because the tetrahedral Co2+ spe-
cies occupy the Al3+
tetra sites. A higher lattice energy of octahedral Al3+
sites results in its high stability in the Al2O3 structure, limiting the
substitution of Co2+ for Al3+
oct [50]. In addition, a similar coordinate
environment allows that the substitution of tetrahedral Co2+ for
Al3+
tetra occurs easily.
The difference in Co-related coordinate structures between
these two Co catalysts is further studied by Co K-edge EXAFS spec-
tra (Fig. 3D). The Fourier transform moduli are limited to the ﬁrst
shell of neighbors (up to R = 4.0 Å) and the corresponding ﬁts for
both Co catalysts are listed in Table 2. A typical Co3O4 pattern
appears for Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst with a strong peak (label A at
R = 1.5 Å) for the ﬁrst shell Co–O coordination (CN = 4.9) and a
dual-peak (label B and C) of different Co–O–Co coordinations
(CN = 2.3 and 3.4). The peak B is ascribed to the environment of
two adjacent octahedral Co sites with 2.87 Å distance, while peak
C is contributed to the scattering between Co ions in tetrahedral
and octahedral sites (3.35 Å aside) [51]. A ﬁrst shell Co–O coordi-
nation with the distance of 1.98 Å was obtained on Co–Al2O3–HT
catalyst. The corresponding CN number is 4.4, which is remarkably
lower than the average number of spinel Co3O4 phase, suggesting
that
tetra-coordinated
Co
species
dominate
over
hexa-
coordinated Co species in Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst. In addition, par-
ticularly evident peak shifts in the R range of 2.5–3.5 Å is observed
compared to Co3O4 and Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. These signals are
also signiﬁcantly different from the CoO phase (R = 2.6 Å) and
the spinel CoAl2O4 phase (R = 3.2 Å) [33]. Combining the results
of UV–Vis and 27Al NMR characterizations, a structural model of
Co2+-substituted c-Al2O3 is built, the simulated spectrum ﬁts well

occupying a Al3+
tetra site. Two kinds of bridged Co–O–Al bonds con-
necting tetrahedral Co2+ and octahedral Al3+ with different bond
angle and distance (3.00 and 3.49 Å) make the primary contribution
to the dual-peak scattering signal. Above detailed characterization
results provide the structural information of these two Co-based cat-
alysts, which the aggregated Co3O4 nanoparticles are supported on
the c-Al2O3 nanosheets in Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, while tetrahedral
Co2+ sites are isolated in thin c-Al2O3 nanosheets in Co–Al2O3–HT
catalyst.
3.2. Performances of Co-catalyzed PDH reactions
The catalytic performances of Co–Al2O3–HT and Co/Al2O3-IMP
in the PDH reactions with a WHSV of C3H8 of 2.9 h1 at 590 C
are displayed Fig. 4A. It should be noted that the bare c-Al2O3 sup-
port is inactive for the PDH reaction, which the C3H8 conversion
and the C3H6 selectivity are 0.8% and 73%, respectively. For the ﬁrst
5 h on reaction stream, the satisfactory selectivity of C3H6 is main-
tained at >97.1% and >94.6% over Co–Al2O3–HT and Co/Al2O3-IMP
catalysts, respectively. A small amount of the byproducts includes
ethylene,
ethane
and
methane.
The
C3H8
conversion
of
Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst slightly decreases from 24.8% to 21.1%
(speciﬁc rate: 4.5–3.9 lmol g1 s1) in 5 h reaction duration. In
contrast, the conversion over Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst drops from
21.2% to 13.9% (3.9–2.6 lmol g1 s1) in 5 h. A higher TOFCo of
0.093 s1 can be obtained under kinetic region, and a smaller deac-
tivation rate constant of 0.06 h1 quantitatively demonstrates its
better stability compared to Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst (0.16 h1).
The C3H8 conversions of less than 10% are obtained by changing
the space velocity in the temperature range between 550 and
610 C for plotting the Arrhenius dependences of these two
Co-based catalysts (Fig. 4B). The apparent activation energy (Ea)
of Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst is 168.9 kJ/mol, which is lower than that
of Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst (206.7 kJ/mol). These values are lower
than that of Pt-based catalysts but similar to that of Ru/ZrO2-
based catalysts [24,52,53].
For Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst, the nanosheets with relatively smal-
ler thickness and larger surface area can allow more active Co2+
sites exposed on the catalyst surface, leading to enhanced PDH
activity. It is also worth emphasizing that the mass-transfer and
the diffusion kinetics cannot be limited by thin nanosheet struc-
ture [39,54,55]. The PDH reaction is carried out on the sheet-
shaped Co catalyst at different gas ﬂow rates but constant contact
time (constant W/F ratio), and similar C3H8 conversions are
obtained in six runs, as shown in Fig. 5A. The elimination of the
mass transport limitations is also supported by the linear relation
between C3H8 conversion and W/F value in the diffusion experi-
ments (Fig. 5B). In addition, a high C3H6 selectivity and a low
degree of C–C cracking and coking can be achieved on these Co cat-
alysts, as compared to the most frequently reported Pt- and Cr-
based catalysts (Table S2). In-situ reduction of CoOx species to
metallic Co0 in the reductive PDH reaction environment leads to
the formation of CH4 via C–C cleavage [32,56]. In this study, no
metallic Co0 exists in the fresh and the spent catalyst based on
the characterization results, supporting the fact that almost no
CH4 is produced in the PDH reactions over our Co catalysts.
3.3. Characterizations of the spent catalysts
In spite of similarly high C3H6 selectivity (94–97%), the
long-term stability is distinct for these two Co catalysts, which is
determined by the different structures of Co sites interacted with

c-Al2O3 sheet. The characterizations of spent Co/Al2O3-IMP and
Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts are performed to shed further light on the
correlation between the catalytic stability and the catalyst struc-
ture. The XRD patterns (Fig. 2B) show that the phase of c-Al2O3
and its crystal size for these two catalysts are well-maintained in
a 5 h dehydrogenation reaction. For Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst, neither
Co-related phases of metal and oxide nor deposited carbon species
is observed, implying the excellent structural stability of embed-
ded Co2+ sites in the c-Al2O3 sheet support. Such structural stability
is further evidenced by the triplet peaks of the isolated tetrahedral
Co2+ species in the UV–Vis–DR spectrum of the spent Co–Al2O3–HT
catalyst (Fig. 2A). The stable Co2+ local coordination and oxidation
state are also reﬂected on the XANES Co K-edge spectrum and the
XPS Co 2p spectrum, as shown in Figs. 3B and S3. The 27Al NMR
spectrum of the spent Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst in Fig. 3C displays that
there is no obvious difference in the ratio of Al3+
tetra to Al3+
oct between
the fresh and the spent catalysts, suggesting stable coordination
environment of Co2+-containing Al2O3.
However, the structure of Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst dramatically
changes during the PDH reaction. The diffraction peaks of Co3O4
including (4 2 2) peak at 55.6 disappears from XRD pattern
(Fig. 2B), indicating that the atomic rearrangement of unstable
Co3O4 species on the of c-Al2O3 sheet surface occurs under the
reductive reaction atmosphere. The UV–Vis–DR spectrum of the
spent Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst displays a triplet signal of the isolated
tetrahedral Co2+ species rather than a dual-band signal of Co3O4
species that appears in the fresh sample (Fig. 2A), revealing the
change of Co3+-to-Co2+ in Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst during the PDH
reaction. However, the great majority of reduced Co species cannot
embed into the matrix to form spinel CoAl2O4 structure, because
the ratio of Al3+
tetra to Al3+
oct from 27Al NMR spectrum (Fig. 3C) is 0.32
for the spent Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, which is close to that of pure
Al2O3 sheet support (0.35). In the Co K-edge XANES spectrum in
Fig. 3B, a slight shift of rising-edge line toward low-energy is
observed. The spectrum also shows a relatively stronger absorbance
at 7710–7715 eV in pre-edge region, which is assignment to metallic
Co species, as shown in the insert in Fig. 3B. In addition to the feature
of ﬁrst-shell Co–O coordination at R = 1.5 Å, the characteristic signal
of metallic Co species with Co–Co coordination at R = 2.2 Å (label D)
is also reﬂected on the Co K-edge EXAFS spectrum (Fig. 3D) of the
spent Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. These results strongly demonstrate that
both Co3+-to-Co2+ and Co3+-to-Co0 transformations occur during the
PDH reaction over Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. As with the large-size
metallic Co particles, these in-situ generated and highly dispersed
metallic Co species can also cause severe C–C cracking and coking
issues on Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst [32,56,57]. As expected, obvious
diffraction peaks of deposited coke species (the (0 0 2) and (0 0 4)
planes of graphite carbon locate at 26.6 and 54.8) arise on the
XRD pattern of the spent Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. The coke amounts
are further quantiﬁed by TGA analyses. As shown in Fig. 6A, the coke
amount on Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst is 28.5%, remarkably larger than
4.4% on Co-Al2O3-HT catalyst. Therefore, both serious coke deposi-
tion and Co3O4 restructure result in rapid deactivation of Co/Al2O3-
IMP catalyst. A superior catalytic stability of Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst
is beneﬁted from the stable isolated Co2+ site and the great anti-
coke capability. The catalytic effects with these two respects would
be discussed independently in the following sections.
3.4. Stabilization of Co2+ site and desorption of C3H6
The stabilization of active Co2+ sites on the catalyst surface dur-
ing the PDH reaction might be due to the strong interaction
between Co2+ site and the c-Al2O3 sheet support. The reduction
behavior of oxidative Co species in these two Co/Al2O3 catalysts
is investigated by H2-TPR characterizations (Fig. 6B). The TPR curve
of commercial Co3O4 particles as the reference reveals three con-
secutive peaks located at 350–500 C, which are corresponding to
the sequential reduction of Co3O4 to metallic Co via CoO [57–59].
The reduction temperatures of Co3O4 species in Co/Al2O3-IMP cat-
alyst are 478, 579 C and 833 C. These reduction temperatures are
signiﬁcantly higher than that of Co3O4 reference, suggesting that
the CoOx species strongly interact with the c-Al2O3 sheet to inhibit
reduction. Different reduction curve is obtained on Co–Al2O3–HT
catalyst. A single broad peak exists at 678 C, which is attributed
to the reduction of surface CoO species that strongly interacted
with the support by signiﬁcant anchoring effect [59–61]. Consider-
ing that the temperature beyond 800 C is usually ascribed to the
reduction of spinel CoAl2O4 species [32,57], the lack of reduction
peak at such high temperatures indicates that the bulk CoOx spe-
cies inside Al2O3 matrix are still not be reduced. This result con-
ﬁrms that the surface Co2+ species in Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst are
stable at the PDH reaction temperature of 590 C, and cannot be
further reduced into metallic Co0 species that lead to the CH4
formation.
The C3H6-TPD proﬁles (Fig. 6C) show that the starting tempera-
ture for the C3H6 desorption is 50 C and 75 C for Co–Al2O3–HT
and Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, respectively. The maximum C3H6 des-
orption occurs at 80 C and 125 C for these two catalysts, respec-
tively. The easier C3H6 desorption from Co–Al2O3–HT surfaces
suppresses further transformation of the electron-rich C3H6 into
byproducts especially coke during the reaction, therefore main-
taining the excellent selectivity and extending the catalyst lifetime
[39,62,63]. Furthermore, the facile C3H6 desorption quickly release
the active Co2+ sites for devoting these ‘‘free” sites to activate C–H
bond of C3H8 that serves the key step of PDH reaction, and conse-
quently enhances the catalytic performances.

The NH3-TPD proﬁles provide the information about the
strength and the amount of the surface acidic sites in these two
Co catalysts, as shown in Fig. 6D. Similar integral area for the
NH3 desorption peaks is observed, indicating the equal total acid
content on these two catalysts. However, the NH3 can be com-
pletely desorbed from Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst at a relatively lower
temperature, compared with Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst (ca. 600 C vs
700 C). The results suggest that Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst has a
slightly larger content of the weaker acid sites in contrast to Co/
Al2O3-IMP catalyst. The low-coordinate Al3+ of Al2O3 is normally
responsible for coke formation by serving as the acid site
[50,64,65]. The substitution of tetrahedral Al3+ with Co2+ in
Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst reduces these acid sites to suppress the coke
deposits, and thus promotes the catalytic stability in the PDH
reaction.
The Co2+ sites stabilized by c-Al2O3 matrix in Co–Al2O3–HT cat-
alyst shows superior activity against deactivation during the PDH
reaction, which is beneﬁted from the strong metal-support interac-
tion, whereas Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst leads to a dramatic deactiva-
tion. In addition, the facile desorption of C3H6 from the catalyst
surface with lower acidity not only accelerates the catalytic PDH
reaction rate, but also largely inhibits the side reactions especially
the coke formation for satisfactory propylene selectivity and long-
term stability.
3.5. Regeneration behaviors of catalysts
Based on the understanding on the structural information of
Co–Al2O3–HT and Co/Al2O3-IMP catalysts before and after PDH
reaction, their regeneration behaviors are further investigated
independently. Similar deactivation curves in recycling reaction
runs are observed on Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, as shown in Fig. S4.
Its regeneration process not only includes the removal of large
amounts of coke species, but the redox circle of Co-related species
also occurs on the catalyst surfaces. Such redox process of surface
Co species determines that the catalytic activity of the regenerated
catalyst can recover to the initial level without reduction with H2
before next reaction run. However, unstable Co species on the cat-
alyst surface may ultimately embed into Al2O3 matrix to form com-
paratively stable Co2+ active sites after several reaction runs,
leading to similar catalytic properties with Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst.
For the regenerated Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst, the post-reduction is
necessary to renew originally high activity. Fig. 7A displays a near
10
h
climbing
stage
for
pre-activating
the
regenerated
Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst without post-reduction, whereas Fig. 7B
reveals the absence of such pre-activation stage for the regener-
ated Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst with post-reduction. During its regen-
eration process, there may be a strong trend to form ‘‘Troy” Co2+
sites in locally stable structure of CoAl2O4 spinel by Co2+–Al2O3
matrix interaction under the high-temperature oxidizing atmo-
sphere. Although the releasing of these Co2+ sites to the catalyst
surface can be achieved under the reductive reaction atmosphere
consisting of C3H8 and H2, a long time duration needs to be spent
due to the weak status in the competition with PDH reaction. How-
ever, the migration of inner Co2+ species toward the surface can be
rapidly completed for their exposure during the post-reduction
process, which is supported by signiﬁcantly increased relative
intensity of tetrahedral Co2+ signal reﬂected on UV–Vis–DR spectra

in Fig. S5. These results demonstrate again that to recreate surface
Co2+ sites by optimized regeneration procedure is critical for
enhancing Co-catalyzed PDH performance.
3.6. Co2+–Al2O3 interactions at regulated Co loadings
Compared with supported Co3O4 particles in Co/Al2O3-IMP, the
isolate Co2+ sites anchored in Al2O3 sheet beneﬁts the catalytic PDH
performance over Co–Al2O3–HT. Further optimization might be
achieved by increasing the active Co2+ sites in the c-Al2O3 sheet.
Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts with 2–15 wt% Co loadings are prepared
by the same hydrothermal strategy and the Co–Al2O3 interactions
in these catalysts are also carefully examined. UV–Vis–DR spectra
(Fig. 8A) reveal that only sharp triple-peaks of tetrahedral Co2+
sites are observed on 2–7 wt% Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts. The weak
Co2+ signal is reﬂected on 10 wt% and 15 wt% Co–Al2O3–HT cata-
lysts, and the peaks corresponding to Co3+ species are also recog-
nized, indicating the co-existence of Co2+ and Co3+ species in the
Co-rich Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts. The XRD patterns (Fig. 8B) demon-
strates the phase separation between c-Al2O3 and Co3O4 in 7–
15 wt% Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts. The results of UV–Vis and XRD
analyses suggest that the tetrahedral Co2+ species dominate in 2–
7 wt% catalysts, while Co2+ species and Co3O4 particles co-exist
in 10–15 wt% catalysts. The XANES and XPS spectra also reveal that
the Co2+/Co3+ ratio gradually decreases with increasing Co loading
in Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts (Figs. 8C, S6 and Table 1). It is expected
that Co species energetically prefer self-assembly to form oxide
nanoparticles on the support surface beyond the maximum capac-
ity of sheet matrix to anchor the isolated Co2+ sites. The aggrega-
tion is veriﬁed with 27Al NMR results, the relation between the

Al3+
tetra/Al3+
oct ratio and the Co loading displays a reverse volcano vari-
ation trend (Fig. 8D and Table 1). The EXAFS spectra (Fig. 8E and
Table 2) also clarify that the isolated Co2+ species with Co–O–Al
bonds exist in the low-Co-content Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts and the
aggregated Co3O4 species with Co–O–Co bonds dominate in the
high-Co-content catalysts.
The state of Co species determines their interaction with Al2O3
support, as well as the PDH performance. The H2-TPR proﬁles
(Fig. 8F) demonstrate that the reducible species are hardly observed
on 2 wt% catalyst, indicating a strong interaction of single-site Co2+
with Al2O3 sheet. Two peaks corresponding to the Co3O4 reduction
shift towards low temperature, and their intensities increase with
raising Co loadings of 7–15 wt%, suggesting that the formed Co3O4
nanoparticles weakens the interaction with the support.
Satisfactory C3H6 selectivities (93–98%) are obtained on all Co
catalysts in the PDH reactions (Fig. 9). The speciﬁc reaction rate
varies with the Co loadings in Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts. The maximal
activity and stability are obtained on 7 wt% catalyst with a speciﬁc
rate of 5.5 lmol g1 s1 and a lowest kd value of 0.05 h1. A higher
TOFCo of 0.144 s1 can also be achieved on 7 wt% catalyst under
kinetic region. Larger kd values of 0.13 and 0.12 h1 are observed
on 10 wt% and 15 wt% Co catalysts (Table 1), which are equal to
that of some supported Pt catalysts [7,66–68]. The serious deacti-
vation of the high Co loading catalysts is caused by the coking
(59.5% coke in the spent 15 wt% catalyst from TGA result in
Fig. S7) and restructure of Co3O4 species, which is consistent with
the observations on 5 wt% Co/Al2O3-IMP as discussed early. The
presented coke deposit and disappeared Co3O4 phase are simulta-
neously observed on XRD patterns of spent 10–15 wt% catalysts
(Fig. S8). A small amount of coke deposit is found on 7 wt% catalyst
and no evident structural change is observed on 2–5 wt% catalysts.
These results highlight the effect of Al2O3 sheet support on the sta-
bilization of isolate Co2+ active sites via a strong interaction, not
only preventing the reconstruction of surface Co species during
the reaction but also inhibiting the formation of coke deposits.
4. Conclusions
In
summary,
PDH
catalysts
composed
of c-Al2O3-sheet-
stabilized isolate Co2+ sites are prepared in the present study. Reac-
tion testing and extensive characterizations of the catalysts reveal
their excellent structural stability and the strong interaction of Co
with the support. In the PDH reaction, this catalyst displays a high
speciﬁc activity with >97% C3H6 selectivity and a superior coke
resistance compared to Al2O3-supported Co3O4 nanoparticle cata-
lyst. The facile C3H6 desorption can effectively inhibit the side reac-
tions of C–C cracking and coke formation for enhancing the
selectivity and the stability in PDH reaction.
