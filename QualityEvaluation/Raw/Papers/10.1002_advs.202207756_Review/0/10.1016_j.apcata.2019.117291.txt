Abstract: Tin oxide supported on silica (SnO2/SiO2) were prepared by 
incipient-wetness impregnation method and examined for propane dehydrogenation at 
600 °C. The physicochemical properties of SnO2/SiO2 were characterized by 
N2-physisorption, XRD, UV-vis-DRS and H2-TPR. The results indicate that, at Sn 
loading ≤ 1.78 wt%, SiO2 contains a uniform distribution of Sn as isolated species in 
tetrahedral coordination, while crystalline SnO2 together with isolated Sn species are 
found for the higher Sn loadings. The reducibility of various Sn species was studied 
by a combination of XPS, H2-TPR, and reduction-reoxidation-TPR techniques. The 
results reveal that after high-temperature H2 reduction, crystalline SnO2 is fully 
reduced to metallic Sn, whereas isolated Sn are stabilized in the Sn2+ state with high 
dispersion due to a strong interaction between isolated Sn and support. Catalytic 
activity tests showed that these Sn2+ species exhibits both high activity and stability 
for propane dehydrogenation.

1. Introduction 
Journal Pre-proof
In recent years, the increasing availability of inexpensive propane from natural gas 
and the rapidly growing demand for propylene has led to an increased interest in the 
propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which has the potential to make up the shortfall of 
propylene supply left by conventional crackers [1,2]. Nevertheless, PDH is a highly 
endothermic process with equilibrium limitations, and both kinetic and 
thermodynamic considerations make this reaction particularly challenging [3]. 
Catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition, sintering, and restructuring of the active 
species is often severe [4]. Hence, the operating conditions put a difficult demand on 
catalyst stability, and it is, therefore, desirable to be able to design and develop new 
catalysts with high stability and selectivity [5,6]. In this context, much effort has been 
dedicated to the improvement of commercial CrOx and Pt based catalysts [7,8] or the 
development of novel and potential catalysts, such as VOx [9,10], GaOx [11,12], CoOx 
[13] and ZnOx [14,15].  
Tin (Sn) is known as an efficient promoter of Pt catalyst, but is generally 
considered to be an inactive metal as a dehydrogenation catalyst [16]. However, in our 
previous work, metallic Sn supported on silica (Sn0/SiO2) has been proved to be an 
efficient PDH catalyst. The catalyst gives good selectivity for propylene (>85%) with 
little cracking or coking, making this an excellent candidate for the dehydrogenation 
of propane. [17]. Unfortunately, Sn0 is not completely stable under the reaction 
condition due to its low melting point (232 oC). The high reaction temperature triggers 
the sintering and loss of active Sn0 species, ultimately resulting in irreversible catalyst 
deactivation. Thus, the stability of Sn0/SiO2 catalyst is not entirely satisfactory. 
Journal Pre-proof
ions (Fe[3], Co[18], Zn[19], Ga[20], etc.) isolated on silica surface have also been 
suggested as highly selective and stable catalysts for PDH. The authors believe that 
generating isolated sites on silica could diminish reduction of active metal oxide and 
allow for the development of a catalyst with enhanced stability under PDH conditions. 
In fact, isolated Sn on silica prepared via incipient wetness impregnation has been 
reported [21], and it has been successfully tested in several reactions, such as the 
Baeyer-Villager oxidation of ketones to lactones 3-5, and the Meerwein-Ponndorf 
reduction of aldehydes and ketones [22]. However, to the best of our knowledge, 
isolated Sn on silica has rarely been studied as a catalyst for the PDH. This current 
situation invites us to carry out a systematic study in this field.  
Therefore, the aim of the present study is to explore the potential of isolated Sn on 
SiO2 for PDH with a particular focus on a long-term stability. Meanwhile, the effect 
of tin loadings on the distribution of SnOx species on the silica as well as the valence 
state of various Sn species during the PDH reaction are also elucidated with the 
application of different methods (XRD, BET, UV-vis DRS, H2-TPR, XPS). The 
structure-activity relationships of the prepared catalysts are analyzed and elucidated. 
2. Experimental section 
2.1 Catalyst preparation  
A commercial silica with a particle size of 0.18-0.25 mm and specific surface area 
of 330 m2/g was used as support. Prior to its use, it was washed with 1 M HNO3 
aqueous solution for 6 h at room temperature, and then filtered, rinsed copiously with 
deionized water, dried at 100 oC, and calcined at 300 oC for 3 h. Tin (Ⅳ
) chloride 
Journal Pre-proof
pentahydrate (SnCl4∙5H2O, 99.0 %) obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent 
Company was used as tin salt precursor. Bulk SnO2 (purity, 99.9 %) was purchased 
from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, and used as received.  
The silica supported tin oxide (SnO2/SiO2 ) catalysts were prepared, respectively, 
by the incipient wetness impregnation method and water-washing of impregnated 
samples. The impregnation of silica with tin was performed by incipient wetness 
impregnation with an aqueous solution of SnCl4∙5H2O. The mixture were stored in 
partially covered containers at ambient conditions for 6 h. Then, the obtained solid 
was quantitatively divided into two parts: (1) One part was dried at 30 oC under 
vacuum for 24 h and then calcined at 600 oC for 3 h (incipient wetness impregnation 
method); (2) The other part was thoroughly washed with distilled water at room 
temperature through a Büchner until the filtrate was neutral and free from chloride 
ions (negative AgNO3 test). The resulting catalyst precursor was subsequently 
subjected to drying at 30 oC for 24 h and calcination at 600 oC for 3 h. The (1) and (2) 
catalysts are hereafter referred to as x-Sn/Si(n) and y-Sn/Si(n)-(ws), respectively, where 
x and y in the catalyst label express tin content in wt.% of Sn (determined by X-ray 
fluorescence), suffix n is numeric identifier (n = 1, 2…the same n value in the 
x-Sn/Si(n) and y-Sn/Si(n)-(ws) means that two catalysts are derived from the same 
impregnated solid) and ws in the bracket represents water-washed impregnated 
samples.  
2.2 Catalyst characterization 
X-ray diffraction measurements. XRD patterns of all samples were obtained using a 
Journal Pre-proof
Rigaku D/Max RB diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The data 
were collected in the 2θ range between 15° and 75° with a scan rate of 5°/min. 
Nitrogen adsorption and desorption analysis. Nitrogen physisorption experiments 
at -196 oC were carried out using a Quantachrome BET instrument to examine the 
textural property of each sample. About 0.1 g of the sample was pretreated in vacuum 
at 300 oC for 6 h before the measurement. Specific surface area values were obtained 
using the BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) equation. 
Diffusion reflectance UV-vis. Diffuse reflectance measurements in the UV-vis 
region were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2700 spectrophotometer at room 
temperature. All the samples were dried at 300 oC before measurement. The spectra 
were recorded within the wavelength range of 200-600 nm using BaSO4 as a standard. 
Temperature-programmed reduction. The reducibility of catalysts was assessed 
with H2 temperature programmed reduction. 100 mg sample was loaded in a 
U-shaped quartz tube and pretreated in a flow of He at 600 °C for 1 h. After the 
sample had cooled to room temperature in He atmosphere, TPR was carried out up to 
900 oC in 10 % H2/Ar with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The profile was registered 
with a thermal conductivity detector. The amount of hydrogen consumed by the 
sample was obtained by integrating the TPR profile. For H2 consumption 
quantification, CuO (99.999 %, Aldrich) was used as the calibration standard sample. 
About 10, 20, 30, 50 and 75 mg CuO were employed to do H2-TPR experiments to 
achieve a plot of H2 consumption amounts versus TCD integration areas. The average 
oxidation state of tin species was calculated on the basis of H2 consumption by 
Journal Pre-proof
assuming that the fresh catalyst was totally in the oxidation state Sn4+ and that 1 mol 
of hydrogen consumed would mean the reduction of 1 mol of Sn4+ to Sn2+.  
Reduction-reoxidation-TPR experiment. The experiment was carried out in the 
setup described above for TPR measurements. 300 mg sample was reduced in H2 at 
600°C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature in H2 flow, the sample was flushed 
with He for 15 min and then reoxidized in the air flow for 30 min at room temperature, 
after which the H2-TPR was performed with 10 % H2/Ar. The heating rate was 10 
oC/min in the range 50-700 oC.  
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. XPS studies were carried out on an ESCALAB 
250Xi system (Thermo Scientific, USA) equipped with an Al Kα X-ray radiation 
source. Before the measurements, all samples were reduced under a flow of hydrogen 
at 600 °C for 1 h in the catalyst cell attached to the analysis chamber so that the 
transfer was free of reoxidation. The residual pressure inside the analysis chamber 
was below 1×10-7 Pa. The binding energies were calibrated by setting the C 1s peak to 
284.8 eV.  
2.3 Catalytic tests 
The catalytic performance in the PDH reaction of catalysts was measured in a 
quartz fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure at 600 oC. The sieved catalyst 
(60-80 mesh) was held in the reactor by quartz wool and preheated in a stream of dry 
N2 (purity, 99.999 %) for 15 min at 600 oC before each test. Finally, N2 was replaced 
by a reactant stream consisting of propane (99.9 %) without dilution, and the PDH 
reaction started. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 0.65 h-1.

The product gas was analyzed by gas chromatography (Bruker GC-450). The propane 
conversion and the propylene selectivity were calculated using the following 
equation: 
Conversion(C3H8) = nC3H8

Selectivity(C3H6) =

where n with superscripts ‘‘inlet” and ‘‘outlet” stand for molar flow of components at 
the reactor inlet and outlet, respectively.

The textural properties of the freshly prepared SnO2/SiO2 samples, as well as SiO2 
support, are characterized by low-temperature adsorption of N2. The calculated 
specific surface areas and pore volume are presented in Table 1. For both the x-Sn/Si(n) 
and x-Sn/Si(n)-(ws) samples, the surface area and pore volume decrease gradually with 
an increase in the Sn loadings, indicating that at higher Sn loadings some of the pores 
are partly occupied by tin oxide. However, this decrease is moderate for all the 
samples. Even in the case of 3.82-Sn/Si(5) with the highest Sn loading, the SBET value 
is only 6 % lower than that of bare SiO2 support, ruling out the presence of large tin 
oxide particles that may cause plugging of the SiO2 pores.  
3.1.2 X-ray diffraction 
 
Fig. 1. XRD patterns of the (a) x-Sn/Si(n) as well as bulk SnO2, and (b) x-Sn/Si(n)-(ws).  
Fig. 1 depicts the XRD patterns obtained for calcined SnO2/SiO2 samples, along 
with that of bulk SnO2 as a reference. The 2θ angles at 26.6°, 33.9°, 38.0°, 51.8°, 
54.8°, 57.8°, 61.9°, 64.7°, 65.9° and 71.3° are characteristic of the tetragonal rutile 
phase of SnO2 (JCPDS No. 41-1445). The broad diffraction peak at ca. 22°, which is 
observed in the XRD patterns of all the SnO2/SiO2 samples, is typical for amorphous 
Journal Pre-proof
silica.  
For the x-Sn/Si(n) samples, the diffraction peaks corresponding to SnO2 are detected 
in the XRD patterns of the samples with Sn loading ≥ 1.96 wt% (Fig. 1a). It can be 
seen that the peaks due to crystalline SnO2 become sharper and narrower as the Sn 
loadings increase, indicating an increase of SnO2 mean particle size. Estimated from 
the Debye-Scherrer formula based on the (110) reflection of XRD, the average 
particle sizes of SnO2 are 5, 18 and 35 nm for the 1.96-Sn/Si(3), 2.57-Sn/Si(4) and 
3.82-Sn/Si(5) samples, respectively. By contrast, no diffraction peaks other than that of 
the silica support are identified in the patterns of the x-Sn/Si(n) samples with Sn 
loading ≤ 1.36 wt%, and all the x-Sn/Si(n)-(ws) samples (Fig. 1b). The absence of the 
diffraction peaks characteristic for SnO2 phase in the XRD patterns of these samples 
may be explained either by the presence of a high dispersion of SnO2 phase on the 
SiO2 support or by a detection limit of XRD technique. Hence, UV-vis spectroscopy, 
which has been successfully used to distinguish the SnOx species in silica supported 
tin systems, is also utilized to obtain more definitive information about the possible 
presence of XRD-undetectable surface SnOx species for SnO2/SiO2 samples.  
3.1.3 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy 
Journal Pre-proof
 
Fig. 2. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra of (a) x-Sn/Si(n), and (b) x-Sn/Si(n)-(ws). 
A comparison of the UV-vis spectra of the SnO2/SiO2 samples investigated is 
shown in Fig. 2. For the x-Sn/Si(n) samples with Sn loading ≤ 1.36 wt% and all the 
x-Sn/Si(n)-(ws) samples, the spectra are essentially the same, revealing a main 
absorption band with a maximum absorbance below 200 nm. According to [23-24,25], 
this band is assigned to the O→Sn4+ charge transfer of isolated Sn4+ species in 
tetrahedral coordination. The intensity of this absorption increases with the Sn loading, 
indicating an increase in the concentration of these isolated Sn species. In the case of 
the x-Sn/Si(n) samples with Sn loading ≥1.96 wt%, in addition to the band 
characteristic of isolated Sn4+ species, a broad UV-vis band at around 280 nm is 
observed. According to [26-27], the band around 280 nm is ascribed to the electron 
transition from valence band to conduction band of crystalline SnO2. Such a result 
indicates that crystalline SnO2 is formed on these samples, in agreement with the 
XRD observations as shown in Fig. 1a. In a previous report we notice absence of 
SnO2-related signals in UV-vis considering a detection limit of 0.08 wt% Sn for 
crystalline SnO2 [31]. Since no signs of the presence of crystalline SnO2 is found in 
Journal Pre-proof
x-Sn/Si(n) samples with Sn loading ≤ 1.36 wt%, and all the x-Sn/Si(n)-(ws) samples, it 
is concluded that these samples are free of crystalline SnO2.  
3.1.4 Temperature-programmed reduction 
 
Fig. 3. H2-TPR profiles for differently prepared SnO2/SiO2 catalytic materials as a 
function of Sn loading: (a) x-Sn/Si(n) and (b) x-Sn/Si(n)-(ws). 
The reducibility of various SnOx species in the SnO2/SiO2 catalysts is investigated 
by H2-TPR experiments and the profiles are displayed in Fig. 3. Quartz wool and SiO2 
are examined as control experiments, and these are found to show negligible reduction 
signals. For comparison and calibration purposes, the TPR profile of bulk SnO2 is first 
obtained (Fig. S1). This shows a broad reduction peak at ca. 620 oC, attributable to the 
characteristic reduction of Sn4+ to Sn0 [28-29]. 
The TPR profiles of the x-Sn/Si(n) samples are shown in Fig. 3a. It can be seen that 
the reduction effects for the samples depend on the Sn loading. Only one sharp and 
intense peak at ca. 500 oC is observed for the samples with Sn loadings lower than 
1.36 wt%. According to the above UV-vis observations and literature [30-31, 34], this 
peak could be ascribed to the reduction of isolated Sn4+ to Sn2+. An increase in the Sn 
content above 1.36 wt% of Sn results in the appearance of additional peaks above 500 
Journal Pre-proof
oC. These peaks are only seen for these high-loaded samples which have been shown 
to contain crystalline SnO2 (XRD, Fig. 1 and UV-vis-DRS, Fig. 2) and thus are 
assigned to the reduction of these bulk-like SnO2 crystallites species [32].  
Besides, the Tmax of the peaks due to crystalline SnO2 gradually shifts to the higher 
temperature with the increase of Sn loading. A former study proves that for bulk tin 
oxide, the larger the particle size, the harder for it to be reduced [33]. As the particle 
size increases tin oxide become more difficult to reduce due to bulk diffusion 
limitation, which will result in a shift of the reduction peaks to higher temperatures 
[34]. It has been reported that large SnO2 particles (27 nm) display a reduction peak at 
650 oC [40], whereas reduction Tmax of small SnO2 particles (10 nm) locates at 580 oC 
[35]. Thus, these shifts to higher Tmax imply that the average sizes of crystallite SnO2 
tend to increase with the Sn loading. This trend is in accord with the variation 
tendency of crystallite SnO2 sizes calculated by Debye-Scherrer formula.  
The TPR profiles of all the x-Sn/Si(n)-(ws) samples are almost the same as those of 
low-loaded x-Sn/Si(n) samples (≤1.36 wt%) and also characterized by one peak of H2 
consumption related to the reduction of isolated Sn4+ species (Fig. 3b ). In addition, 
the high-temperature reduction peaks originated from crystalline SnO2 are not 
observed for all the x-Sn/Si(n)-(ws) samples, indicating that they are free of crystalline 
SnO2, which agrees well with the XRD and UV-vis DRS results.  
On the basis of the results obtained from above XRD, H2-TPR and UV-vis-DRS 
work, it is determined that in the calcined SnO2/SiO2 samples an initial coverage of 
the silica support occurs, constituted of isolated Sn4+ species in tetrahedral 
Journal Pre-proof
coordination anchored to the support, whereas crystalline SnO2 and isolated species 
are found for the higher Sn loading. Besides, from a comparison of characterization 
results for x-Sn/Si(n) and x-Sn/Si(n)-(ws), it can be found that rinsing the impregnated 
SnO2/SiO2 samples with water prior to drying and calcination process can effectively 
reduce the amount of crystalline SnO2 in the calcined catalysts, whereas isolated Sn4+ 
species are almost unaffected by such treatment. For x-Sn/Si(n) samples with Sn 
loading ≤ 1.36 wt%, the Sn loading and the types of Sn speices are basically 
unchanged after water-washing. This means that during the initial impregnation, some 
tin chloride complex in the impregnating solution adsorbs strongly on the silica 
support, which resist being removed by treatment with water. After calcination, these 
strongly adsorbing species are converted into isolated Sn species. These results 
suggest the existence of a strong interaction between isolated Sn4+ and support, which 
leads to the anchoring of partial tin chloride complex to support, causing a buildup of 
isolated Sn4+ in the early stages of impregnation.  
3.2 Propane dehydrogenation activity
 
Fig. 4. Propane dehydrogenation over the calcined SnO2/SiO2 catalysts: (a) propane 
conversion and (b) selectivity to propylene. Reaction conditions as described in 
Journal Pre-proof
section 2.3 
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over the calcined SnO2/SiO2 
catalysts is investigated in a fixed-bed reactor at 600 °C under 1 atmosphere total 
pressure. Prior to the catalytic tests, a control experiment is performed in the absence 
of catalyst, with the catalyst replaced by SiO2 of equal volume. It is found that under 
the conditions used for the tests, the background propane conversion is negligible. 
The propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the investigated catalysts as a 
function of time-on-stream are depicted in Fig. 4.  
It can be noted that all of the freshly prepared SnO2/SiO2 catalysts exhibit relatively 
low C3H8 conversion and extremely poor C3H6 selectivity at the first data point (5 min 
on stream). Subsequently, conversion of propane and selectivity to propylene increase 
simultaneously and reach their maximum at 60 min. After this period, stable activities 
with pronounced selectivity to propylene (>85 %) can be maintained for all the 
samples. Meanwhile, a relatively large amount of COx is detected during the initial 
period of reaction. Such results indicate that an induction period is required to develop 
the active site for the production of propylene, that is, a period for the in situ creation 
of active and selective Sn species.

Fig. 5. Propane dehydrogenation over the H2 pre-reduced SnO2/SiO2 catalysts: (a) 
Propane conversion and propylene selectivity; (b) The rate normalized per unit 
surface area of propane conversion. 
To understand better the behavior of the catalysts during the induction period, the 
activities of the SnO2/SiO2 catalysts are measured after hydrogen reduction (10% 
H2/Ar, 600 oC and 1 h), and the results are presented in Fig. 5a. It is of interest to note 
that the H2-pretreatment has a distinct influence on the catalytic performance of all 
SnO2/SiO2 catalysts at the initial stage of the reaction, with essentially no influence on 
the steady-state activity. Pre-reduced SnO2/SiO2 samples show immediate high initial 
activity without experiencing the induction period. More importantly, the activities of 
the pre-reduced samples are at the same level as the steady-state activities of their 
calcined counterparts. These findings, together with the H2-TPR revealing that 
extensive reduction of tin oxide on the SnO2/SiO2 catalysts takes place below 600 oC 
(Fig. 4), suggest that a partial reduction of highly oxidized Sn4+ species in the calcined 
catalysts is beneficial for the extended conversion of C3H8, and particularly for the 
formation of C3H6.  
The C3H8 conversion increase with an increase of the tin loading and reach the 
Journal Pre-proof
maximum for the catalyst containing 1.78 wt % of Sn. A further increase in the Sn 
loading affects the catalytic activity slightly, and no sharp drop in activity is observed. 
The rate normalized per unit surface area of propane conversion is proportional to the 
Sn content of 0.83-1.78%. With further increasing Sn content, the rate normalized per 
unit surface area does not increase. The characterization results show that in low 
loaded (≤1.78 wt%) SnO2/SiO2 samples, isolated Sn4+ species predominate, and the 
amount of these well-dispersed Sn species increase as the Sn loading increases, 
similar as the catalytic activity increases. This confirms the involvement of the 
isolated Sn species in the PDH reaction.  
3.3 Oxidation states of tin oxide after reduction 
Considering the fact that the PDH reaction over the calcined SnO2/SiO2 catalysts is 
characterized by an induction period, and pre-reduction of the catalysts at 600 oC with 
hydrogen can fully eliminate the induction period, it is believed that Sn species with 
lower oxidation state is more active for the PDH reaction than Sn4+ species in calcined 
catalysts. Thus, it is essential to find out the oxidation state of Sn after 
high-temperature H2 reduction. 
Thus, the amounts of H2 consumed during the H2-TPR experiments were measured, 
and the average oxidation state of tin species was calculated. For comparison purpose, 
a quantitative chemisorption experiment of the consumed H2 is also performed by 
using calibrated pulses of pure H2 at 650 oC to quantify the reduction extent of tin 
speices (detailed information can be obtained in section S2 of the supporting 
information).

the bulk SnO2, the degree of reduction of Sn4+ is 99.6 %, indicating that bulk SnO2 
can be completely reduced to Sn0 [36]. For the samples with Sn loading less than 1.78 
wt%, on which isolated species are dominant, the degree of reduction of Sn4+ varies 
slightly with the increase of Sn loading and is 50 ± 5 % based on a Sn4+ to Sn0 
reaction. Thus, the average oxidation state of isolated tin speices after H2 reduction 
should therefore be Sn2+. These results indicate that isolated Sn4+ species are only 
partially reduced, which agrees with results of Aguirre et al. [37]. However, for 
samples with Sn loading ≥ 1.96 wt%, the degree of reduction of Sn increases with the 
increase of Sn loading, and it gradually exceeds 50% but is still less than 100%, 
suggesting that some of Sn4+ in these samples are reduced to the metallic state. To 
Journal Pre-proof
probe this hypothesis, XRD studies of 2.57-Sn/Si(4) and 3.82-Sn/Si(5) samples after 
H2-TPR experiments are carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. S3. It can be 
seen that the diffraction peaks owing to crystalline SnO2 in the XRD patterns of 
calcined samples entirely disappear, and the diffraction peaks due to metallic Sn 
emerge after H2-TPR. Since the above characterization results suggest that these two 
samples contain both isolated Sn4+ species and crystalline SnO2, and isolated Sn4+ 
species are only partially reduced after TPR, the metallic Sn species are more likely 
produced by the complete reduction of “bulk-like” crystalline SnO2.

To gain further insight into the oxidation state of the supported Sn species after H2 
reduction, XPS studies on reduced SnO2/SiO2 samples (10 vol.% H2/Ar, 600 oC and 1 
h) are performed, and the results are shown in Fig. 6. In the case of the reduced 
1.96-Sn/Si(3) and 2.57-Sn/Si(4) samples, the shape of the Sn 3d5/2 peak indicates the 
presence of a doublet. After curve fitting, two peaks are obtained with peak positions 
Journal Pre-proof
at 486.5-487.0 and 484.5 eV corresponding to oxidized Sn (Sn2+ or Sn4+) and metallic 
Sn (Sn0), respectively [38-39,40,41]. For the reduced 1.78-Sn/Si(4)-(ws) and 
1.36-Sn/Si(2) samples, Sn 3d5/2 peaks lie in the range of 487-488 eV, and peaks due to 
Sn0 is not detected, which tell us that the majority of the Sn is in the oxidized Sn (+2, 
+4) state. Unfortunately, XPS cannot discriminate between Sn2+ and Sn4+ oxidized 
states [50]. However, the results in Table 2 regarding an assessment of the extent of 
Sn reduction indicate that the reduction of isolated Sn4+ species does not proceed 
below an average oxidation state of Sn2+. Hereby, we propose that isolated Sn4+ is 
reduced only to Sn2+ state.  
Besides, a noticeable shift of Sn 3d5/2 peak to the higher binding energy is observed 
when the loading of Sn decreases. By XPS and Auger spectroscopy, Jiménez et al. 
find that at very low coverages of SnO on SiO2, XPS shows a positive binding energy 
shift of around 1 eV in the BE of the Sn3d5/2 peak with respect to the values found for 
the bulk SnO. Electron energy loss spectroscopy shows that this shift is due to 
interaction effects among SnO and SiO2 since excitation energy of Sn-O-Si tends to 
be higher than Sn-O-Sn [42]. Thus, the shifts in the Sn3d5/2 peak observed in Fig. 7 
suggests the existence of interactions between Sn2+ species and SiO2 support.

Fig. 7. H2-TPR profiles of selected samples obtained in the reoxidation treatment at 
room temperature. 
It has been reported that metallic Sn could react with oxygen to form oxide 
overlayer even at room temperature (RT), whereas Sn2+ do not adsorb oxygen at all 
[43]. Based on this, a reduction-reoxidation-TPR experiment is carried out to further 
clarify whether isolated Sn4+ species are reduced to the Sn0 during the 
high-temperature reduction. After H2-reduction, the reduced catalyst is cooled to room 
temperature (RT) in hydrogen and then reoxidized in air flow at RT. The re-oxidized 
catalyst is again subjected to the second TPR. For comparison, a physical mixture of 
silica and metallic Sn powder (0.6 wt% Sn) are prepared by manually grinding the 
silica and Sn powder (>99.9%, Aladdin) in a mortar, and are also subjected to the 
experiment. The TPR profiles of the reoxidized samples are shown in Fig. 7. 
The TPR profile of a physical mixture of metallic Sn and SiO2 shows a symmetric 
peak at 400 oC. Since the SiO2 shows negligible reduction signals, it can be concluded 
that the detected H2 consumption peak is the result of the reduction of tin oxide layer 
formed on the metallic Sn during the reoxidation treatment. Similar reduction peaks 
Journal Pre-proof
are observed for 1.96-Sn/Si(3) and 2.57-Sn/Si(4) samples, demonstrating that metallic 
Sn is formed on the two samples, in agreement with the XPS observations. Instead, 
there is no distinct reduction peak for 0.83-Sn/Si(1), 1.36-Sn/Si(2) and 1.78-Sn/Si(4)-(ws) 
samples, implying that the reduced Sn species present on the catalysts cannot be 
reoxidized at room temperature. Combined with the results of XPS and TPR, it is 
concluded that isolated Sn4+ species are reduced only to Sn2+ state.  
It is known that bulk SnO is thermodynamically unstable, and can disproportionate 
to Sn0 and SnO2 above 550 oC [44]. However, the above results demonstrate that 
isolated tin species can be stabilized in the Sn2+ state after hydrogen reduction. This 
must indicate that there is a strong interaction between the Sn2+ and the silica support, 
which hinder the disproportion and complete reduction of Sn2+. Besides, the XRD 
pattern of 1.78-Sn/Si(4)-(ws) samples taken after reduction in hydrogen shows only a 
broad diffraction peak due to the amorphous silica, and no obvious diffraction peaks 
corresponding to SnO (Fig. S3), suggesting that these Sn2+ species are not present as 
bulk SnO, but are well-dispersed on the silica support. 
3.4 Long-term stability test of well-dispersed Sn2+ species 
 
Journal Pre-proof
Fig. 8. On-stream propane conversion and propylene selectivity in PDH reaction over  
pre-reduced 1.78-Sn/Si(4)-(ws) catalyst. Reduction condition: T = 600 oC; 10 vol.% 
H2/Ar; 1 hour. Reaction conditions: T = 600 oC; C3H8 molar ratio = 100 %; WHSV = 
0.65 h-1.  
One of the biggest challenges of the PDH is the deactivation of catalysts with 
time-on-stream. Hence, the catalysts must be regenerated frequently to maintain 
sufficient activity. Nevertheless, such treatment results in a gradual loss of initial 
activity and reduced on-stream stability on account of the restructuring of the 
catalytically active species [45]. In our previous work, Sn0 has been observed to be 
active for the PDH reaction and shows stable performance during 60 h reaction [26]. 
Unfortunately, Sn0 is not completely stable because of low melting point. The high 
temperature of reaction triggers the loss and sintering of Sn0, resulting in irreversible 
deactivation of the catalyst.  
Thus, an extended 120 h on-stream operation for PDH is carried out on the reduced 
1.78-Sn/Si(4)-(ws) catalyst with the aim of examining the likely long-term behavior of 
well-dispersed Sn2+ species under the reaction conditions. Fig. 8 shows the variation 
of propane conversion and selectivity to propylene as a function of time-on-stream. It 
can be seen that the catalyst exhibits exceptionally stable activity during evaluation 
period. After 120 h on-stream, only a 3.5 % loss of initial activity is detected, 
stressing the high stability of these Sn2+ species.  
To gain insights into the recyclability of these well-dispersed Sn2+ species, the 
1.78-Sn/Si(4)-(ws) catalyst after 120 h time-on-stream is regenerated with air at 600 oC 
Journal Pre-proof
for 3 h followed by the reduction in hydrogen. From Fig. S4, it is clear that the initial 
activity of the catalyst can be fully recovered upon oxidative regeneration, and the 
regenerated catalyst exhibit stable performance without apparent deactivation. To 
check whether a change in Sn constitution occurs during the reaction-regeneration 
process. After reaction, the catalyst is treated with air again to burn of any carbon 
deposits and cooled down to room temperature in pure N2, and then taken out for later 
XRD, UV-vis-DRS and XRF analysis. As shown in Fig. S5, the XRD pattern of the 
regenerated catalyst exhibits no peaks except for those of the silica support, and the 
UV-vis spectrum reveals only one absorption bands below 200 nm which is assigned 
to isolated Sn4+. Our previous work shows that the volatilization of metallic Sn over 
the course of long-term PDH reaction leads to the decrease of Sn content in the 
catalyst since the melting point of metallic Sn is much lower than the reaction 
temperature. Nevertheless, XRF results in Table S1 show that no significant change in 
Sn loading is observed for 1.78-Sn/Si(4)-(ws) catalyst after 120 h reaction-regeneration. 
Sn loading slightly decreases to 1.71 % from 1.69 %. These results indicate that these 
dispersed Sn2+ species are highly stable during the long-term reaction.  
 
4. Conclusion 
In this study, silica-supported tin oxide catalysts with the Sn contents varying from 
0.8 to 3.8 wt % are prepared. Combination of the characterization results obtained by 
different techniques for SnO2/SiO2 catalysts reveals that the nature and distribution of 
SnOx species depend on the Sn loading. SnOx surface species are highly dispersed as 
Journal Pre-proof
isolated species in the samples with Sn loading up to 1.78 wt%. Crystalline SnO2, as 
well as isolated species is present on the samples with higher Sn loading.  
Catalytic activity tests in propane dehydrogenation show that Sn species with a 
lower oxidation state favor selective conversion of propane to propylene than highly 
oxidized Sn4+ in the calcined catalysts. A detailed investigation of the valence state of 
various Sn species on the support surface is therefore carried out by using several 
characteration techniques. From the results of these studies, it reveals that after 
reduction, isolated Sn4+ species are stabilized in Sn2+ state by interaction with the 
silica support. The results of  long-term stability test show that these Sn2+ species 
exhibit extremely stable catalytic performance for 120 h reaction on-stream without 
apparent deactivation, which could be explained by the strong interaction between 
Sn2+ and support.
