Abstract
This review looks at the main processes avail-
able for the production of light oleﬁns with a focus on
maximizing the production of propylene. Maximization of
propylene production has become the focus of most re-
ﬁneries because it is in high demand and there is a supply
shortage from modern steam crackers, which now produce
relatively less propylene. The ﬂexibility of the ﬂuid cat-
alytic cracking (FCC) to various reaction conditions makes
it possible as one of the means to close the gap between
supply and demand. The appropriate modiﬁcation of the
FCC process is accomplished by the synergistic integration
of the catalyst, temperature, reaction-residence time, coke
make, and hydrocarbon partial pressure. The main con-
straints for maximum propylene yield are based on having
a suitable catalyst, suitable reactor conﬁguration and re-
action conditions.

Introduction
Light oleﬁns are important raw materials in many petro-
chemicals because they are building blocks for many end
products, such as polyethylene and polypropylene. Re-
cently, market analysis show that the demand for propylene
is outpacing that of ethylene and the current supply cannot
match the demand. A large proportion of propylene is
produced by steam cracking (SC) of light naphtha and
during the ﬂuid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. Figure 1
illustrates the propylene production capacity of the main
technologies and their contribution in bridging the demand
supply gap [17, 51].
SC is an established technology for the production of
light oleﬁns, such as ethylene and propylene. It accounts
for about 60–65 % of the world’s propylene production,
with the established reﬁnery FCC process accounting for
30 % and the remainder is produced on purpose using
metathesis or propane dehydrogenation [57, 76].
With the ethylene and gasoline being the main products
from SC and conventional FCC, respectively, propylene
and other light oleﬁns are obtained as byproducts from
these technologies. Propylene production from steam
crackers depends upon the operating rates of the steam
cracker and the type of feedstock. In the past, propylene
was produced from steam crackers via heavy liquid
cracking and as a result, it was readily available; however,
most modern steam crackers use ethane-based feed in place
of heavy liquids leading to less propylene being produced
as illustrated in Table 1 [18]. From Table 1, it is expected
that propylene production from steam crackers will be
lower than the corresponding ethylene production as a re-
sult of the shift to ethane-based feed.
As highlighted in Fig. 1 and Table 1, it can be seen that
SC alone cannot satisfy the demand for propylene.
Therefore, there is need of new technology to produce
additional propylene to bridge the gap between supply and
demand.
With on purpose propylene production technologies,
such as propane dehydrogenation and metathesis being
touted as possible alternatives, the cost associated with
these technologies remains less competitive relative to
steam crackers and FCC.

It could have been easier to ﬁll the gap by reconﬁguring
the steam cracker, but the steam cracker does not provide
ﬂexibility of operation and it has high energy consumption.
It is the most energy consuming process in the chemical
industry and uses approximately 8 % of the total global
primary energy use, excluding energy content of ﬁnal
products [89]. According to Ren et al. [89], the pyrolysis
section of a naphtha steam cracker alone consumes about
65 % of the total process energy and contributes to about
75 % of the total energy loss.
Being an essentially non-catalytic and nonselective
process SC is energy intensive and catalysts have never
been widely used in the pyrolysis section in SC to optimize
energy efﬁciency. By adopting technologies based on the
reconﬁguration of the FCC unit to maximize the production
of propylene and light oleﬁns, it is expected that energy
savings and ﬂexibility of operation will be obtained be-
cause [58, 89]:
•
First, FCC catalysts provide an alternative route to SC
with the use of lower activation energy for C–C bonds
rupture. Consequently, the temperatures for the new
catalytic naphtha cracking processes are 150–250 C
lower than those for steam crackers.
•
Second, catalysts improve selectivity to desired prod-
ucts, such as propylene. Even if the same operating
conditions as those of SC are applied for catalytic
cracking, the total oleﬁn yield would still be enhanced
by at least 15 % [4].
•
Third, coke formed during the cracking process is
constantly removed by catalysts that are in turn decoked
through catalyst regeneration or catalyst decoking.
•
Fourth, FCC is one of the most ﬂexible processes in a
reﬁnery and can readily adjust to changes in feed
quality through modiﬁcations to catalyst and operating
conditions.
The conﬁguration of the FCC process, which involves a
circulating ﬂuidized bed with the availability of heat and
mass transfer and catalysts regeneration, makes it possible
for the FCC to be used for applications that go beyond the
upgrading of heavy feed to gasoline.
In the FCC, light oleﬁns are produced via catalytic
cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks by contacting the feed
with a catalyst usually consisting of one or more crystalline
microporous molecular sieves to selectively convert the
feed into an oleﬁn containing mixture.
The propylene demand from FCC is growing at a faster
rate than global FCC capacity and therefore propylene
yields from FCC need to increase to keep up with demand.
Figure 2 illustrates the production of additional propylene
due to the advent of on-purpose FCC technology.

The objective of the present review is to evaluate the
processing of hydrocarbon feedstocks to produce propylene
and summarize the effects of existing FCC technology,
operation variables and catalysts on product quality and
quantity. These three main factors form what is called the
constraint triangle for maximizing propylene production as
described by Maadhah [65]. The effect of each factor is
discussed and supported by experimental results in the
literature.
Variables that affect propylene production
Reactor conﬁguration
New FCC catalyst technologies are being developed to
enable reﬁners to achieve the challenging propylene yields
required to meet the growing demand for propylene from
FCC. As a result, various methods and conﬁgurations have
been proposed for increasing or enhancing the output of
propylene product stream from the FCC unit (see Fig. 3).
By taking into consideration the operating conditions
and yields of the FCC, the propylene yield pattern can be
represented in the form of a continuum varying from op-
erating severity to process design and these can be opti-
mized to suit the reﬁnery speciﬁc economics [32]. The
optimum process design provides reﬁners with the ﬂex-
ibility to move up or down the optimal economic range of
the propylene yield curve as shown in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3,
it can be seen that higher propylene production comes at
the expense of gasoline. For traditional reﬁners, maximiz-
ing gasoline yield is more important than the propylene
yield, while for those interested in petrochemical applica-
tions, the target is operating at maximum propylene yield.
With the strong market demand for propylene and the
capability to achieve elevated propylene yields via FCC
technology, there is a natural desire to go for maximizing
propylene yields.
Riser and downer FCC
Many FCC processes increase propylene by manipulating
FCC reaction variables such as catalyst to oil (C/O) ratios,
residence times and reaction temperatures [39]. The
modiﬁcations can be put into two categories: Up Flow
(Riser) and Down Flow (Downer) technologies. In the riser
reactors, solid catalyst and hydrocarbon vapors ﬂow up-
wards against gravity. This upward ﬂow results in a cata-
lyst ﬂow that is signiﬁcantly slower than the lighter
hydrocarbons leading to back mixing of the catalyst and as
a result there is an increase in residence time of the cata-
lyst. This in turn can lead to undesirable secondary reac-
tions leading to over cracking. The illustration of the ﬂow
pattern in the riser and downer is shown in Fig. 4 [6].
In contrast to risers, and to overcome the issues related
to back mixing, the downer reactor was developed as il-
lustrated in Fig. 4. The ﬂow of the catalyst and the feed is
in the direction of gravity and as such, back mixing is
largely avoided and there is an even distribution of catalyst
with an effective contact time of catalyst and feed less than
that of the riser.
The FCC technology based on the downer design, and
which is in commercial operations, is brieﬂy described
below.

Downer FCC technology: high severity ﬂuid catalytic
cracking (HS–FCC)
The HS–FCC process developed jointly by Saudi Aramco
and its partners is operated under considerably higher reac-
tion temperatures (550–650 C) than conventional FCC
units and the main objective is to produce more propylene
and high octane number gasoline [3, 5, 24, 41, 64, 65, 82].
Under these conditions, however, thermal cracking of hy-
drocarbons also takes place concurrently with catalytic
cracking, resulting in increased undesirable products as dry
gas and coke. Short contact time (less than 0.5 s) of the feed
and product hydrocarbons in the downer minimizes thermal
cracking. Undesirable successive reactions, such as hydro-
gen transfer, which consume oleﬁns, are suppressed. To at-
tain the short residence time, the catalyst and the products
have to be separated immediately at the reactor outlet. For
this purpose, a high efﬁciency, short residence time product
separator has been developed, and is capable of suppressing
side reactions (oligomerization and hydrogenation of light
oleﬁns) and coke formation [5, 6, 24, 41, 65].
Due to the short contact time, the conversion in HS–
FCC mode is expected to drop and to compensate for this,
the HS-FCC process is operated at a high C/O ratio and at
higher temperatures than the conventional FCC. The ad-
vantage of operation at a high C/O ratio is the enhanced
contribution of catalytic cracking over thermal cracking.
High C/O maintains heat balance and helps minimize
thermal cracking, over cracking, and hydrogen transfer
reactions. The synergetic operation of the reaction condi-
tions, high C/O ratio and downer operation guarantee a
high oleﬁn.
Riser FCC technology
Two technologies based on Riser FCC are deep catalytic
cracking (DCC) and catalytic pyrolysis process (CPP),
developed by SINOPEC.
a.
Deep catalytic cracking (DCC)
DCC is derived from FCC and its ﬂow scheme is similar
to that of FCC consisting of a continuous reaction/
regeneration system with ﬂuidized catalyst circulation [68,
83, 92, 93, 100, 103, 105]. The main difference in hardware
is a bed reactor installed after the riser. DCC uses FCC
principles with speciﬁc enhancements to produce large
yields of light oleﬁns and high octane naphtha. To achieve
a high oleﬁn yield, a high reactor temperature is required.
The DCC unit operates at temperatures as high as 570 C,
somewhat higher than maximum oleﬁn FCC and residue
FCC operations.
b.
Catalytic pyrolysis process (CPP)
CPP is further modiﬁed from DCC aiming at more
ethylene production. The modiﬁcation includes new cata-
lyst formulation, varied operating conditions and some
changes on engineering [100, 105].
CPP catalyst possesses the features of low hydrogen
transfer reaction; high matrix activity; active component
consisting of both large pore and meso-pore zeolites;
modiﬁcation of the meso-pore zeolite to increase the ratio
of Lewis acid to Bronsted acid for enhancing free radical
reaction; higher hydrothermal stability and lower attrition
index. CPP operating conditions are more severe than that
of DCC. In comparison with DCC, the reaction tem-
perature is about 80 K higher, therefore, it requires higher
regeneration temperature to provide the heat of reaction;
and both the steam dilution and catalyst to oil ratio are
double. CPP uses a riser reactor, a quenching technology,
and a cross current degassing device to minimize the ﬂue
gas adsorbed and entrained by the regenerated catalyst (see
Table 2).
DCC and CPP use more steam than conventional FCC
(Table 3) and their operation can be termed as steam cat-
alytic cracking (SCC). SCC is a process of cracking hy-
drocarbons to light oleﬁns in mild temperatures in the
presence of steam over a catalyst. SCC combines mild
thermal cracking with the acid promoted cracking of a
zeolite-based catalyst, and can provide very high yields of
light oleﬁns (with the possibility of varying the propylene-
to-ethylene ratio) while operating at temperatures much
lower than those used in the SC process [104]. The main
feed for the SCC process so far has been naphtha or other
light feed [5, 9, 29–31, 65, 67, 89, 104], but the amount of

coke produced during cracking of naphtha, or similar feeds,
is too low to produce heat by combustion to maintain the
catalyst temperatures required in the reactor. Therefore,
extra heat will have to be supplied into the regenerator by
burning off added hydrocarbons or more coke would have
to be produced by using suitable catalyst and heavier
feedstocks as a solution for heat balancing the SCC.
Characteristics of some FCC technologies
Table 2 illustrates the main characteristics of the FCC-
based technologies compared to those of SC.
Most of the new FCC based technologies for SCC make
use of high C/O ratios to promote catalytic cracking and
reduce thermal cracking. Using a high C/O ratio also
guarantees that more heat is transferred from the regen-
erator to the reactor as the catalyst and oil will equilibrate
at higher temperatures in the reactor.
Apart from the DCC, all the other techniques have
shorter residence times in the reactor than the normal FCC
and again, this is based on the triple constraints in the
triangle in Fig. 3. For the CPP and HS–FCC, which operate
at higher temperatures, the advantage of shorter residence
time is to prevent over cracking, which can lead to the
production of more ethylene. While for the DCC, a longer
contact time is required to guarantee the cracking of the
reactants.
The product distribution from these technologies is
summarized in Fig. 5 from which it can be seen that all the
FCC modiﬁed processes produce more propylene than the
main FCC process. Also, apart from the HS–FCC process,
more coke is produced showing that these processes are
capable of achieving the heat balance needed during
steady-state operation. Another observation is the fact that
all the FCC-based processes produce less gasoline, espe-
cially the CPP process. This shows that if the FCC-based
processes are fully integrated into the reﬁnery system, there
is a possibility of having a shortage of gasoline in the
market. This therefore requires that a balance be made
between maximum propylene yield and guaranteeing ga-
soline supply. One way of guaranteeing gasoline produc-
tion is to look at using crude oil as feed so that reﬁnery
capacity should not be a restricting factor for the new
processes.
While propylene generation from an FCCU certainly
varies with feedstock, it is primarily a function of catalyst
type, reactor temperature, partial pressure, C/O ratio and
total pressure.
Catalyst composition
Catalyst structure
One of the factors that affects the design and operation of
an FCC unit is the type of catalyst to be employed in the
process. Most FCC catalysts consist of an active compo-
nent (zeolite), a matrix such as amorphous silica-alumina
(which also provides catalytic sites and larger pores), a
binder (such as betonite clay) and ﬁller, which provides
physical strength of the catalyst [7, 42, 50, 68, 84, 95, 102,
104]. Ultra-stabilized zeolite Y (USY) is used as the main
active zeolite in today’s conventional FCC catalyst, which
consists of different phases as shown in the schematic
representation in Fig. 6 [84]. It is composed of spherical
particles, suitable for application in a ﬂuidized circulating
reactor, in which the zeolite crystals are dispersed in an
active matrix of alumina or silica-alumina together with
clay particles. The spherical particles contain large voids
and pores necessary for allowing the mass transport of the
heavy feedstock.
The matrix of an FCC catalyst serves both physical and
catalytic functions [95]. Physical functions include pro-
viding particle integrity and attrition resistance, acting as a
heat transfer medium, and providing a porous structure to
allow diffusion of hydrocarbons into and out of the catalyst
microspheres [7, 42, 47, 95, 102, 104]. The matrix can also
affect catalyst selectivity, product quality and resistance to
poisons.

The matrix tends to exert its strongest inﬂuence on
overall catalytic properties for those reactions, which di-
rectly involve large molecules.
FCC catalysts also have a hierarchical pore architecture
spanning from the macro- to meso- to microporosity with
an illustration shown in Fig. 7 [79]. Each of these classes
of pores has a deﬁned role in the entire catalytic process.
According to this scheme, the transformation of heavy
molecules to valuable products (gas-oil and gasoline) oc-
curs in the meso- and micropores [10, 56, 59, 62, 63, 66,
73, 78, 79, 87, 88, 90, 97].
Although the FCC unit was developed purposely to help
in the conversion of low value feed into more gasoline, the
unit and the process have undergone several modiﬁcations,
some of which are aimed at tackling the increasing demand
for some of it byproducts, such as propylene. Propylene
used to be a byproduct from the FCC unit, but recent
market trends have made it possible for the redesign of the
FCC unit, subsequently upgrading propylene from a
byproduct to a co-product. This has also meant a redesign
of the catalyst that will enable the production of more
propylene.
For the modern conventional FCC process, the desired
catalyst properties are:
•
Good stability to high temperature and to steam [5, 29,
30, 31, 43–45, 52, 61, 65, 67, 69, 99, 104, 106]. The
catalysts must have the thermal stability to maintain
particle and catalytic integrity under severe regenerator
conditions.
•
High activity to carry out conversion of the feed before
any signiﬁcant amount of thermal cracking sets in.
Thermal cracking leads to undesirable products such as
methane, ethane and some propane. On the other hand,
catalytic cracking produces relatively fewer C1 and C2
fragments and a larger number of oleﬁns are produced.
•
Large pore sizes to crack larger molecules so that
they can get into smaller pores.
•
Good resistance to attrition to maintain particle mor-
phology under the severe impact and erosion forces that
exist in the FCC unit.
•
Low coke production so the catalyst can remain active
for a longer period.
One catalyst that has been incorporated into the FCC
catalyst formulation for the production of light oleﬁns is
ZSM-5. Table 3 shows the chronology of catalyst and ad-
ditive development for light oleﬁns enhancement in the
FCC.
ZSM-5 additive for oleﬁn production
a.
Effect of ZSM-5 amount
As the unit operating severity is limited by mechanical
constraints and the choice of feed is characteristic of the
source of crude oil, the selection of the optimum catalyst
system is critical in maximizing both the desired yield and
unit proﬁtability [8]. This requires a thorough understand-
ing of the unit constraints and limitations, as well as the
feed quality and yield objectives. The optimum catalyst
system will maximize both propylene selectivity and ga-
soline oleﬁnicity, while minimizing hydrogen transfer,
isomerization, oligomerization and aromatization reac-
tions. For the purpose of producing more propylene and
oleﬁns, more ZSM-5 is being used as the main active
component of the catalyst in the FCC unit [2, 11, 19, 33,
108].
Bulatov and Jirnov [20] analyzed feed conversion over
varying concentrations of a component additive containing
ZSM-5. The additive level was varied from 0 to 40 % over
a C/O ratio of about 28, a riser outlet temperature of
566 C, a riser partial pressure of 0.0793 MPa, and a
contact time of 1.5 s. From the analysis, it was observed
that increasing the amount of ZSM-5 to very high levels

123
had only a marginal effect on the production of propylene
as shown in Fig. 8.
Propylene yield tends to plateau with about 10 % ZSM-
5 crystal concentration in the catalyst inventory. This is
explained by the fact that the diminishing effectiveness of
ZSM-5 at higher concentrations occurs primarily due to the
depletion of the gasoline oleﬁn precursors. ZSM-5 gener-
ates propylene by selectively cracking oleﬁns in the gaso-
line boiling range. As the concentration of ZSM-5 additive
in the catalyst inventory increases, the incremental yield of
propylene produced per percentage of additive decreases.
Crystal size (diffusion path length) and the Si/Al ratio
(catalyst acidity) of ZSM-5 will also affect the yield of
propylene and to suppress large transition state high reac-
tion order, undesirable hydrogen transfer and aromatization
reactions, the acid sites need to be quite far apart and the
crystal size needs to be small.
b.
Effect of crystal size
The main factor allowing molecular sieving, and con-
sequently, the shape selectivity is generally considered to
be exclusively a steric effect, i.e., only molecules having a
critical kinetic diameter lower than the channel diameter
are allowed to enter the pores and to react on an active site,
or to exit them and to be recovered as a product of the
reaction [12]. Alternatively, transition state shape selec-
tivity effects limit the formation of bulky transition state
intermediates inside the pores and avoid the formation of
some unwanted reaction products. In a heterogeneous
catalytic reaction involving large molecules, diffusion of
these large molecules to the catalytic active internal sites of
the zeolites will become a rate limiting process. More
secondary products and faster deactivation were observed
due to longer intra-crystalline diffusion path lengths [23,
48, 75, 77].
One method of overcoming these diffusional limitations
is to reduce the particle size of zeolites and shorten the
diffusional paths [37]. In ZSM-5 there exists a remarkable
molecular sieving effect for light hydrocarbons and this has
been widely used as shape selective catalysts in various
hydrocarbon processes; however, because the crystal sizes
of ZSM-5 are usually much larger than the sizes of the
micropores, the rate limiting step of the reaction tends to be
the diffusion of the reactant/product molecules within the
micropores [40, 54, 101]. Moreover, carbon solid (coke)
readily forms near the external surface of the crystal under
diffusion controlled conditions, thereby, rapidly plugging
the pores, leading to a short catalyst lifetime. To achieve
low diffusion resistance, nano-sized zeolites are effective
because the diffusion length for reactant/product hydro-
carbons, which depends on the zeolite crystal size, is re-
duced [55, 74, 98]. High propylene selectivity from
cracking of naphtha is favored over larger 10-membered
ring zeolites having a pore index between 26 and 30. The
pore size index is deﬁned as the product of the two prin-
cipal dimensions, or diameters, of the pore and is in units of
square Angstroms (A
˚ 2).
Konno et al. [54], studied the effect of zeolite crystal
size on the catalytic stability using ZSM-5 zeolites (Si/
Al = 150) in n-hexane cracking. Their results are sum-
marized in Fig. 9. From their results, it can be seen that
the initial conversion of n-hexane was almost the same
(approximately 94 %) regardless of the crystal sizes, and
the highest ethylene ? propylene yield obtained was
53.5 C-mol % with a propylene/ethylene ratio of 1.57 at
94.1 % conversion over MFI(S)150. Subsequently, the
conversion gradually decreased with time onstream over
MFI(L)150, decreasing to 48 % after 50 h. In contrast,
MFI(S)150 and MFI(M)150 maintained high conversions
at 82 and 81 %, respectively, after 50 h, and were hardly
changed from the start of reaction. Moreover, the stable
activity of the nano-zeolites (MFI(S)150 and MFI(M)150)
gave stable product selectivities compared with the
macro-zeolite (MFI(L)150).
c.
Effect of Si/Al
ZSM-5 zeolite has a unique three-dimensional structure,
with very small pores compared to the Y-zeolite in a nor-
mal FCCU catalyst. This makes ZSM-5 zeolite ‘‘shape
selective’’ for cracking the long chain (C6–C10) oleﬁn
molecules in FCCU gasoline (it also cracks the equivalent
parafﬁn molecules but at a much slower rate). The products
of these cracking reactions are predominantly propylene
and butylene, with a small amount of isobutane [86].
Changing the Si/Al ratio in ZSM-5 translates to altering the
ratio of cracking/isomerization rates.
Catalytic active sites also exist on the external surface
and at the pore mouth of zeolite crystals. For shape se-
lective reactions, these sites are considered to be respon-
sible for unwanted nonselective catalysis [81]. Most
hydrogen transfer reactions in ZSM-5 occur on the surface
of the catalysts and are more pronounced at low Si/Al

ratios when acidity is high [13, 35]. These hydrogen
transfer reactions lead to the production of more dry gas,
such as methane and ethane, leading to a drop in the se-
lectivity of light oleﬁns. It is thought that a smaller crystal
size in combination with high Si/Al ratio gives higher light
oleﬁns yields due to lower residence time of primary
products in the pores of the catalyst in contact with the acid
sites [109].
The stability of the catalyst is also affected by the Si/Al
ration especially in relation to coke formation. It has been
proven that the higher the Si/Al (lower acidity), the smaller
the amount of coke form, with the knock-on effect being
the extended catalyst lifetime. This is directly linked to the
fact that coke deposition is dependent on hydrogen transfer
reactions, which in turn is dependent on the catalyst acid-
ity. If the catalyst acidity is suppressed, then the rate of
coke deposition is reduced.
d.
Hydrothermal stability of ZSM-5
The main cause of ZSM-5 deactivation is de-alumination
due to the presence of steam at high temperatures, which
leads to a partial destruction of its framework structure [5, 29,
30, 31, 43–45, 52, 61, 65, 67, 69, 99, 104, 106]. To overcome
of this problem, phosphorus impregnation has been used to
stabilize the ZSM-5 structure. Several studies have reported
changes on the hydrothermal stability after impregnation
with phosphorus not only for ZSM-5 zeolites but also for
FAU and MOR zeolites [5, 29, 30, 31, 43–45, 52, 61, 65, 67,
69, 99, 104, 106]. Even so, before the steaming treatment, the
impregnation with phosphorus was said to produce several
counterproductive effects [22]:
•
Reversible decrease in activity due to the interaction of
P species with the protonic sites;
•
External surface blockage;
•
Decrease in the microporous volume; and even
•
De-alumination.
Despite these setbacks, the phosphorus impregnated
samples seemed to retain their acidity and activity dur-
ing the steam treatment to a higher level than the un-
treated zeolite. This means that the phosphorus species
formed in the treatment reinforce the zeolite structure
and prevent de-alumination. The optimal phosphorus
content (highest activity) obtained depends essentially on
the zeolite (Si/Al) ratio and on the model reaction used
[16, 21]. For example, Blasco et al. found a maximum in
the n-decane cracking activity for P/Al molar ratios of
0.5–0.7 [16].
If normal FCC catalysts have to be adopted for pro-
cesses using SCC, then the catalysts would have to be
highly hydrothermal and this should be achieved without
necessarily compromising the yield to ethylene and
propylene [29, 30].
e.
Coke formation
FCC processes are usually accompanied by the pro-
duction of coke and all heterogeneous acid catalyzed re-
actions of organic compounds result in deactivation due to
coking. Coke can be deﬁned as compounds with hydro-
carbon ratio of 0.3–1.0 and it is made up of many com-
ponents, which are nonvolatile, with low boiling points and
low hydrogen content.
Coke is generally formed as a result of a sequence of
elementary reactions, which are affected by the type of
reaction, feed composition, type of catalyst and reaction-
reactor environment. In addition, a range of factors will
affect the composition of coke, including the nature of the
reactants, time on-stream, temperature, acid site concen-
tration and the location of the coke deposit [15, 22, 34, 38].
Therefore, coke will have a broad range of compositions,
determined by these different factors.
There are ﬁve main types of coke identiﬁed in catalytic
cracking [22, 34, 38].
•
Catalyticcoke—from condensationand dehydrogenation.
•
C/O coke—hydrocarbons entrained in the small pores
and not removed by the stripper.
•
Thermal coke—formed by a free radical mechanism, it
is important at high reaction temperatures and also
yields hydrogen. It is less important than catalytic coke
due to the low extent of thermal cracking at typical
FCC conditions.
•
Additive coke (or Conradson coke)—from heavy
molecules already present in the feed. Its amount
correlates directly with the Conradson carbon residue
(residue remaining after the fuel has been pyrolyzed by
raising the temperature to 800 C).
•
Contaminant coke—from dehydrogenation catalyzed
by Ni, Fe and V.

Coke formation is highly complex and probably in-
volves precursors of various types, as well as many chain
reactions and rearrangements inside the channels and
cavities and/or on the external surface of the catalyst.
Therefore, it is a very important consideration when
acidic zeolite catalysts are used. When deciding which
catalyst and which process to use, it is essential to un-
derstand fully the mechanisms that control coking and the
effect it has on catalytic properties, such as activity and
selectivity. In most industrial processes, catalyst deacti-
vation is as important a consideration as controlling the
activity and selectivity, because it is extremely costly. It is
therefore a fundamental economic objective to limit de-
activation by coking and also to regenerate catalysts. The
problems relating to facilitating the stability of catalysts
and optimizing their regeneration need to be investigated
in both industrial and academic laboratories to ﬁnd both
technical and conceptual solutions.
It is known that in zeolites, pore size, pore structure and
acidity affect coke deposition [44]. The ZSM-5 zeolite has
a lower tendency to form coke, compared to the Y zeolite,
due to its narrow pores that limit the formation of bulky
coke intermediates.
After considering the reactor system and catalyst for-
mulation to go with it, the next thing that will ultimately
affect conversion and product selectivity is the reaction
variables.
Reaction variables
Effect of contact time or catalyst circulation rate
Residence time in the reactor varies according to the re-
actor conﬁguration, reaction temperature, C/O ratio and the
intended product. Taking the HS–FCC conﬁguration for
example, short contact time is required to prevent a sec-
ondary reaction involving hydrogen transfer reactions from
occurring [6]. In terms of residence time distribution, the
conventional FCC has a higher residence time distribution
than the HS–FCC process. This is because the HS–FCC
process uses a higher C/O ratio, higher temperature and it
is aimed at maximizing propylene production to prevent
thermal cracking and hydrogen transfer reactions from
taking place as illustrated in Fig. 10.
Outside the optimum residence time window, there is
the possibility of producing less propylene than anticipated
because there is low conversion at lower residence time,
and over cracking at higher residence time.
Meng et al. [70] studied the effect of contact time on
product distribution at 650 C using VGO and CEP-1
catalyst and their results are shown in Table 4.
The feed conversion was about 98.5 % and remains
relatively constant with residence time. The yields of light
oleﬁns ﬁrst went up until a residence time of about 2.0 s,
where they remained relatively constant.
A longer residence time indicates that there was more
time for catalytic pyrolysis of hydrocarbons, and therefore
the pyrolysis extent was more thorough. At these ex-
perimental conditions, the reaction rates of heavy oil cat-
alytic pyrolysis were very fast. The LPG was susceptible to
secondary cracking reactions to produce dry gas, and ac-
cordingly, the yield of LPG decreased as residence time
increased. At the same time, the yields of dry gas, gasoline
and diesel oil increased.
Effect of temperature
A rise in temperature will increase the extent of catalytic
cracking. In a commercial unit, the reaction temperature is
raised by raising the catalyst circulation. By using a higher
C/O ratio, the reaction rate of the catalytic cracking is
improved and the propylene yield increases. To control the
hydrogen transfer reaction, it is better to use a short contact
time since it is a secondary reaction. Reactions with only
short contact times will also control overcracking [46].
HS–FCC units operating at maximum propylene pro-
duction use short contact time along with high reaction
temperature and higher C/O ratio. This is to accelerate
catalytic cracking, limit thermal cracking and control the
hydrogen transfer [6, 20].
Meng et al. [70] studied the effect of temperature on
feed conversion, selectivity of total light oleﬁns and pro-
duct distribution in the reaction temperature range of
600–716 C using a CEP-1 catalyst. The results from their
study are summarized in Fig. 11.
From the results in Fig. 11, as the temperature goes up,
the yield of dry gas increases, while that of propylene and
butylene decreases. Secondary reactions by propylene and
butylene increase as a consequence of further pyrolysis,
due to temperature increase.

According to the experimental data, ethylene yield in-
creases with the increase of reaction temperature, while the
yields of propylene and butylene pass through maxima.
Propylene and butylene are mainly generated through
cracking mechanism via the carbonium ion and because
they are intermediate products, they can undergo secondary
reactions such as cracking and hydrogen transfer, espe-
cially at high temperatures. So from their results, to achieve
a high propylene yield, the optimum temperature range is
620–660 C and the propylene yield is much higher than
that of ethylene.
Effect of C/O ratio
The amount of catalyst that contacts the feed will vary
depending on the temperature of the regenerated catalyst
and the severity of the FCC process. A high C/O ratio will
operate to maximize conversion, which tends to favor light
oleﬁn production [71, 80, 94].
Although it has been well established within the art of
FCC that increasing C/O ratios will increase conversion,
C/O ratios cannot be easily increased since this ratio is not
an independent variable in standard FCC units. Rather the
C/O ratio is dependent on the heat balance limitations of
the unit. Consequently, only relatively low C/O ratios of
4–10 are typically observed for conventional FCC. Such a
means of increasing C/O ratios, however, was not expected
to maintain high catalyst activities due to the coke deac-
tivation of the catalyst. Reducing the C/O ratio results in an
increased light oleﬁn yield and a decreased dry gas yield.
An example of the effect of C/O ratio is illustrated in
the study carried out by Meng [70] and shown in Table 5.
As the C/O ratio goes up, the feed conversion and the
yields of dry gas and coke increase, that of gasoline and
diesel oil decrease, while that of LPG shows a maximum
at about 17. From the data, there is little variation in the
yields of light oleﬁns with increasing C/O ratio. It shows a
slight increase in ethylene yield and a slight decrease in
the butylene yield. Also, yields of propylene and total
light oleﬁns pass through maxima and the selectivity to
light oleﬁns reaches its highest value of 49.42 % at
around a C/O of 13.
A large C/O ratio means that reaction will occur at a
higher temperature as the catalyst and feed will equilibrate
at high temperatures. This means much energy can be
transferred in the reaction process, which can accelerate
thermal cracking reactions. To a certain extent, a high C/O
ratio means a thorough pyrolysis as this can promote sec-
ondary reactions of light oleﬁns and may affect production

cost. Therefore, the value of the C/O ratio cannot be too
high and should be optimized based on the FCC technology
being used.
Effect of feed quality
Feedstocks that are high in aromatics have low hydrogen
content and therefore are resistant to conversion at typical
FCC residence times. The production of propylene requires a
disproportionate share of the hydrogen and co-products, in-
cluding propane, and dry gas requires an even greater share of
hydrogen. Therefore, the amount of hydrogen available from
the feedstock can limit the potential to produce propylene.
Subsequently, propylene production is highly dependent on
feed properties. Conradson carbon is another important factor
as much of the Conradson carbon ends up as coke, thereby
further reducing the potential propylene production.
Meng et al. [70] were able to show the effect of feed-
stock quality on product distribution by investigating four
types of feeds using a CEP-1 catalyst at a reaction tem-
perature of 660 C, residence time of 2.2 s, C/O weight
ratio of 15.5 and steam-to-oil weight ratio of 0.75. Their
results are summarized in Table 5:
From the results in Table 6, they found that the feed
conversion of the four kinds of heavy oils remained very
high, above 98 %. They also observed that as the hydro-
carbon mol ratio was increasing with a corresponding de-
crease in aromatic carbon content, the yields of dry gas,
diesel oil was decreasing, but the coke yield showed an
increasing trend. The yields of LPG and light oleﬁns to-
gether with the selectivity of overall light oleﬁns show an
increasing trend.
In general, more propylene can potentially be derived
from feed sources that are hydrogen rich and low in con-
taminants because of the relative ease of conversion [8,
70]. Feed sources rich in aromatic components produce
fewer oleﬁn precursors in the gasoline boiling range, re-
sulting in potentially less propylene yield.
Effect of hydrogen transfer index
The hydrogen transfer index is deﬁned as the parafﬁn/oleﬁn
ratio of C3, linear C4 and branched C4 species. The relative
activity of FCC catalysts for generating secondary reac-
tions can be estimated using the hydrogen transfer index
(HTI) for catalysts tested under constant conditions with
the same feed [1, 8, 27, 36, 60, 91, 107]. Catalysts with
lower HTIs generate fewer secondary reactions, preserving
a greater quantity of the gasoline boiling range oleﬁns,
which can be subsequently cracked to lighter oleﬁns.
Suppressing hydrogen transfer by maximizing the avail-
ability of oleﬁn precursors is the key to maximizing
propylene.
Hydrogen transfer reactions involve the formation of
bulky bimolecular reaction intermediates, and are mainly
controlled by steric constraints, due to the space available
inside the micropores of the zeolites [28]. They can also
occur on the outer surface of the zeolite particles. The
smaller the pore size of the zeolite, the greater the extent of
the suppression of the hydrogen transfer reactions of the
alkenes, which means that the HTI decreases with the pore
size of the zeolite.
Zhu [109] studied the effect of pore size on hydrogen
transfer activity and from their results, they showed that

hydrogen transfer activity decreases as the pore size of the
zeolite decreases. For the zeolite studied, they showed that
the HTI decreased in the following order: Y [ Be-
ta [ MCM-22 [ ZSM-5.
Catalyst properties can be modiﬁed by several tech-
niques to suppress hydrogen transfer reactions. Controlling
the zeolite acid site density and optimum dispersion of
these acid sites is crucial in minimizing hydrogen transfer
[14, 72, 85]. Reducing the number of acid sites may be
accomplished by minimizing the zeolite unit cell size
(UCS) [85]. The zeolite UCS may be reduced by several
techniques; as the alumina ions are removed, the intrinsic
activity of the zeolite decreases.
Hydrogen transfer activity may also be mitigated by
producing a zeolite with a highly accessible pore structure,
which enhances diffusion. A catalyst designed with high
accessibility allows the oleﬁn produced from primary
cracking to rapidly diffuse from the catalyst particle. Since
hydrogen transfer is a bimolecular reaction requiring the
reactants to be in close proximity to a pair of acid sites,
reducing the residence time of oleﬁns within the catalyst
particle reduces the hydrogen transfer rate. For small pore
zeolites, the residence time can be reduced by using
nanocrystals.
Effect of hydrocarbon partial pressures
It is generally expected that a rise in hydrocarbon partial
pressure will increase the rate of all bimolecular reactions,
including hydrogen transfer, relative to cracking, which is
unimolecular [49]. An increase in the rate of hydrogen
transfer will result in a reduction of oleﬁns in both gasoline
and LPG, and an increase in gasoline range aromatics and
parafﬁns. The change in the rate of hydrogen transfer could
also affect the gasoline sulfur concentration as well as the
effectiveness of gasoline sulfur reduction catalysts and
additives. Moreover, the effectiveness of ZSM-5 additives,
which are used to produce light oleﬁns, especially propy-
lene, could be affected by the hydrocarbon partial pressure.
As ZSM-5 works by cracking gasoline range oleﬁn mole-
cules, changing the rate of hydrogen transfer could have a
profound impact on the propylene yield.
Hu [49] studied the effect of hydrocarbon partial pres-
sures on propylene yield by using a Davison circulating
riser (DCR) and their results are summarized in Table 7.
From their results in Table 7, they found that raising the
hydrocarbon partial pressure increased the amount of dry
gas and coke at the expense of gasoline. They attributed the
higher coke yield to a higher rate of oligomerization, which
is a bimolecular reaction and favored at high pressure.
They also found that increasing the hydrocarbon partial
pressure substantially lowered the C3 and C4 oleﬁnicities
leading to a decrease in the yield of propylene and buty-
lene. These yield shifts suggest that the rate of hydrogen
transfer increases with hydrocarbon partial pressure, as
would be expected for a bimolecular reaction [26, 49].
These observations are consistent with the notion that
hydrogen transfer reactions, being bimolecular in nature,
increase with rising hydrocarbon partial pressure. The hy-
drogen transfer increased with the hydrocarbon partial
pressure. They also demonstrated that the effectiveness of
ZSM-5 additives was lessened at high hydrocarbon partial
pressure due to the depletion of gasoline range oleﬁns via
hydrogen transfer reactions.

Conclusions
The main constraints for maximum propylene yield are
based on having a suitable catalyst, suitable reactor con-
ﬁguration and reaction conditions. The FCC process is
modiﬁed by the synergistic integration of the catalyst,
temperature, reaction-residence time, coke make, and hy-
drocarbon partial pressure. Achieving maximum propylene
and conversion from a wide range of feed qualities offers
considerable challenges to the catalyst design. The impact
of feed composition and process variables on the yields and
heat balance is signiﬁcant and therefore requires a good
understanding of the chemistry to help with designing the
right FCC catalyst for a unit. To guarantee high propylene
yield, a good catalyst must have low hydrogen transfer,
high accessibility and prevailing matrix technology to
complement
the
right
reaction
system
and
reaction
conditions.
Global propylene demand trends remain strong, and
with the change toward lighter feedstocks in modern steam
crackers there will be a growing dependence on the FCC to
balance the supply side of the propylene equation. Some of
the technologies described in this review are those that
have been taken to the commercial stage such as DCC and
HS–FCC, and are by no means an exhaustive list because
there is a rising interest and ongoing research in applying
special reactors and catalysts to control the yield of oleﬁns
and improve energy efﬁciency. The future development of
catalytic oleﬁn technologies would be strongly affected by
the market forces and feedstock cost competition.
