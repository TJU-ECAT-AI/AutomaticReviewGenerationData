Abstract: 
12 
A number of hierarchical GaZSM-5 zeolite molecular sieves with diverse amounts of mesoporosity and 
13 
acidity were prepared by post-synthetic desilication with different concentrations of alkali. The zeolite 
14 
structure and acidity have an important effect on the catalyst lifetime and the product distribution of the 
15 
methanol to olefins (MTO) reaction, which have been investigated. The changes in pores and acidity by 
16 
post-treatment were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, NH3-TPD, FTIR, Py-IR, etc. An alkali treatment 
17 
of an appropriate concentration can increase the mesoporosity and reduce the strong acid density, which 
18 
improves catalytic stability by suppressing coke formation. However, excessive alkali concentrations cause 
19 
low crystallinity and excessive acidity despite a high mesoporosity, which is conducive to the formation of 
20 
aromatic products and coking. The desilication significantly changes acidity of GaZSM-5 zeolites and 
21 
affects the product selectivity; the selectivities of C2 and C3 olefin are consistent with the change of Lewis 
22 
acid amount.

1. Introduction 
1 
 
2 
With the continuous reduction in petroleum resources, namely, natural gas and coal, other abundant 
3 
storage resources are used to synthesize methanol. Methanol can be converted to ethylene, propylene, 
4 
gasoline, and aromatic hydrocarbons according to different reaction processes of some solid-acid catalysts. 
5 
The methanol to olefin (MTO) conversion reaction, as a non-petroleum path to produce important raw 
6 
chemical materials, has received wide attention from academic and industrial fields [1]. The MTO reaction 
7 
process is complex, and the product distribution is closely related to the catalyst. The HZSM-5 molecular 
8 
sieve was the initial catalyst for the MTO reaction and has been extensively studied thus far because of its 
9 
two-dimensional ten-membered ring structure and favourable acidity. However, although ZSM-5 has been 
10 
industrialized for the MTO reaction, its selectivity of light olefins is relatively low, and carbon deposition is 
11 
unavoidable due to the limited mass transfer of micropores and the excessive Brønsted acid sites [2]. 
12 
Therefore, the search for modifying ZSM-5 to extend the life of the catalyst and the selectivity of olefin 
13 
products has attracted the attention of researchers. 
14 
  Modifying zeolites with heteroatoms is an appropriate method for adjusting pore structure, decreasing 
15 
acid strength and density, and improving catalytic performance. Many metal-modified ZSM-5 zeolites have 
16 
been successfully synthesized, such as ZnZSM-5, FeZSM-5, and GaZSM-5, and applied in methanol 
17 
conversion reactions [3,4]. The introduction of Ga atoms in ZSM-5 zeolites can not only increase the 
18 
selectivity of olefins by promoting dehydrogenation properties, improving acid properties and providing 
19 
unique pore structures but also effectively inhibit the secondary reaction, thereby inhibiting the further 
20 
conversion of olefins into aromatic hydrocarbons [5,6]. Some post-synthesis routes, such as ion exchange, 
21 
impregnation and mechanical mixing, are used to synthesize isomorphic metal-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites. 
22 
Introducing Ga species into catalysts with different synthesis methods can obtain different structures and 
23 
acidities due to the different positions and forms of Ga. The impregnation method is a common method for 
24 
preparing Ga-containing ZSM-5. However, the dispersity of Ga species in ZSM-5 obtained by the 
25 
impregnation method is poor. Most of the Ga species appear outside the pore due to the hydrated Ga3+ ions 
26 
are so bulky that they cannot enter the channels of ZSM-5, and some large extra-crystalline Ga2O3 species 
27 
aggregates on the outer surface [7]. It is understood that the poor dispersity and weak interaction between 
28 
Ga2O3 and the zeolite lattice result in poor catalytic performance in the MTO reaction. Undoubtedly, an 
29 
isomorphic-substituted ZSM-5 zeolite with a large Ga3+ framework and a small number of dispersed 
30 
- 3 - 
extra-framework Ga2O3 molecules can be obtained via an in situ synthesis method that shows high 
1 
dispersity and stability of Ga species in a molecular sieve crystal structure [8,9]. The aromatic selectivity 
2 
and the dehydrogenating activity of the Ga isomorphic-substituted ZSM-5 are enhanced because of the 
3 
existence of a few highly dispersed extra skeletal gallium oxide species (ex-GaO+) that are close to 
4 
Brønsted acid sites.   
5 
Although the isomorphic-substituted ZSM-5 zeolite was successfully synthesized and showed improved 
6 
catalytic performance in the MTO reaction, the limited mass transfer of micropores and some 
7 
non-framework species that inevitably exist in the pore channel makes it easy to form coke and lead to a 
8 
low catalytic life. According to previous reports, the introduction of mesoporous particles can improve the 
9 
diffusivity and reduce the formation of coke [10,11]. It is a long-established and particularly appealing 
10 
method to generate mesopores by post-synthesis with an acid or alkali solution because of its simplicity and 
11 
fairly extensive applicability [12-14]. However, studies about the preparation of hierarchical Ga 
12 
isomorphic-substituted ZSM-5 zeolite by a post-synthesis method are scarce. 
13 
In the current study, the synthesis of hierarchical Ga-containing ZSM-5 zeolite was introduced based on 
14 
the first synthesis of Ga isomorphic-substituted ZSM-5 zeolite by a hydrothermal method and then an alkali 
15 
treatment with different concentrations of NaOH. The catalytic performances of the hierarchical 
16 
Ga-containing ZSM-5 zeolites were evaluated for the methanol to olefins conversion reaction to determine 
17 
the effects of introducing Ga atoms in the zeolite framework and the increased mesoporosity on the 
18 
formation of coke and product distribution.

2. Experimental 
20 
2.1 Preparation of catalyst 
21 
2.1.1. Synthesis of GaZSM-5 
22 
The fabrication process of Ga-containing ZSM-5 zeolite involves two steps based on the synthesis 
23 
method of ZSM-5 zeolites [15]: synthesis of a seed suspension and synthesis of GaZSM-5 zeolite by 
24 
isomorphic substitution. The seeding suspension was prepared from a clear mixture whose molar 
25 
composition is Al2O3:100, SiO2:21.4, TPAOH:650 and H2O. The starting materials were mixed with 
26 
tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH), aluminium isopropoxide (AIP), deionized water and 
27 
tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). The solution was stirred and pre-hydrolysed for 3 h at room temperature. 
28 
Next, it was heated for 12 h at 90 °C. The seeding suspension was obtained and set aside after cooling 
29 
without any treatment.  
30 
- 4 - 
Ga isomorphic-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites were prepared based on the synthesis route of ZSM-5 zeolites. 
1 
The whole synthesis procedure is the same except that a gallium source was adopted instead of an 
2 
aluminium source. First, Ga2O3, which was the gallium source, was dissolved into sodium hydroxide 
3 
solution at 2 h for 160 °C in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Second, the gel mixtures were 
4 
synthesized with a molar composition of Ga2O3:100, SiO2:6, Na2O:1250 and H2O. The Al-containing seed 
5 
suspension (5 wt.%) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 30 minutes. Then, the mixture was 
6 
transferred to an autoclave with hydrothermal treatment at a temperature of 180 °C for 24 h. The 
7 
synthesized Ga isomorphic-substituted ZSM-5 zeolite was denoted GaZSM-5.  
8 
To remove the organic template and other impurities, all of the GaZSM-5 samples were calcined in 
9 
standing air at a rate of 5 degrees per minute to 550 °C (holding time of 6 h). What is more important, the 
10 
samples were ultimately added to 1.0 M NH4NO3 solution twice by an ion exchange method at 90 °C for 3 
11 
h with a certain weight ratio of zeolite to NH4NO3 solution (1:10). The samples were calcined in standing 
12 
air at 550 °C for 3 h in order for the NH4
+-form zeolite samples to present the H-form of the products. 
13 
2.1.2. Alkali treatment 
14 
The alkali treatment procedure is as follows. First, different concentrations of 10 mL sodium hydroxide 
15 
solution (0.1 M, 0.2 M, and 0.3 M) were prepared and heated to 80 °C. Second, approximately 3.0 g 
16 
unmodified GaZSM-5 zeolite was added to a hot sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture was stirred and 
17 
refluxed at 80 °C (holding time of 4 h). The slurry was then treated with centrifugal washing until the pH 
18 
dropped to 7. The retained solid product was dried in an oven at 100 °C overnight. Finally, the 
19 
alkali-treated sample was ion-exchanged again to produce the H-form samples. The GaZSM-5 samples 
20 
treated with a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution of 0.1 M, 0.2 M, and 0.3 M were referred to as 
21 
GaZSM5-0.1, GaZSM5-0.2 and GaZSM5-0.3. 
22 
 
23 
2.2 Catalyst Characterization 
24 
A D8 ADVANCE type X-ray powder diffractometer manufactured by Bruker Company of Germany was 
25 
used with Cu Ka radiation as a radiation source (40 mA, 40 kV) and a large-angle diffraction scanning 
26 
range of 5°-80°. The relative crystallinity (%) was calculated by the peak area in the range 2θ = 22°–25°, 
27 
and the relative crystallinity of the GaZSM-5 sample was defined as 100 %. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) 
28 
spectroscopy with an SRS-3400 X-ray fluorometer was used to determine the bulk chemical compositions 
29 
of the samples. To realize the nature of Al and Si, the 27Al and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS 
30 
- 5 - 
NMR) spectra were acquired using a 500 spectrometer (Bruker Avance III) with a 4 mm ZrO2 probe. A 
1 
frequency of 130.3 MHz was used for the 27Al MAS NMR, and the frequency of the 29Si MAS NMR was 
2 
99.4 MHz.  
3 
The morphology of the zeolite was scanned using an S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) 
4 
manufactured by Hitachi. The microstructure of GaZSM-5 and its alkali-treated samples was observed 
5 
under a Tecnai G220 S-Twin transmission electron microscope (TEM) with an accelerating voltage of 200 
6 
kV. The surface area and pore volume values of the samples were tested using an Autosorb-1-MP type 
7 
adsorption analyser. The specific surface areas of the samples were obtained by the BET method, and the 
8 
mesopore volumes were calculated by the BJH method. The volumes and specific surface areas of the 
9 
micropores were obtained by the t-plot method. H2-temperature-programmed reduction measurements 
10 
(H2-TPR) were performed by a Finetec Finesorb-3010 instrument. Typically, 0.20 g of the sample was 
11 
pre-treated in situ at 10 °C/min to 600 °C (holding time of 1 h) under an Ar flow of 40 mL/min. When the 
12 
temperature was decreased to 100 °C in an Ar flow, the H2-TPR measurement was carried out by heating 
13 
from 100 °C to 900 °C in a mixture of 10 vol. % H2/Ar (40 mL/min). During the TPR test, a thermal 
14 
conductivity detector was used to detect the consumed H2. 
15 
The acidic properties of the catalysts were determined by an ammonia temperature-programmed 
16 
desorption (NH3-TPD) method developed by the Dalian University of Technology. The samples were 
17 
activated at 600 °C for 1 h before testing and then cooled to 120 °C. The desorbed ammonia was detected 
18 
in flowing He gas at 40 mL/min by a thermal conductivity detector with a programmed ramp-up of 
19 
10 °C/min up to a temperature of 700 °C. The total amount of acid was calculated by titration with 
20 
hydrochloric acid. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and infrared spectra for pyridine adsorption (Py-IR) 
21 
were used to determine the acidity by acid type. The acidity by acid type, which included Lewis and 
22 
Brønsted acid amount, was determined on a PE100 Fourier transform infrared spectra equipped with a high 
23 
temperature flow cell containing CaF2 windows. The temperature was lowered to 100 °C, and the pyridine 
24 
was adsorbed to saturation after the sample was activated at 300 °C (holding time of 2 h). After that, any 
25 
physisorbed pyridine was removed by degassing for 2 h at 150 °C in vacuum. FTIR spectroscopy was 
26 
performed at room temperature. The data of total acid amount were adopted by NH3-TPD method. The 
27 
integrated molar extinction coefficient was 1.5 for the 1455 cm-1 band characteristic of pyridine on a Lewis 
28 
acid site following the procedure of Ref [16]. The 1455 cm-1 band and 1540 cm-1 band were first area 
29 
integrated and then the area at 1455 cm-1 was divided by 1.5. The concentrations of Lewis and Brønsted 
30 
- 6 - 
acid sites were calculated from the area of the bands at 1450 cm−1 and 1540 cm−1.

2.3 Catalytic measurements 
3 
The MTO reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor equipped with a stainless steel tube that had an 
4 
8-mm inner diameter. Catalyst (1.0 g) was packed in the thermostatic section of the reactor, and both ends 
5 
of the bed were filled with quartz sand. In each test, the catalyst was heated to 500 °C and kept for 2 h 
6 
under a N2 flow of 40 mL/min. After that, the temperature was decreased to the reaction temperature, and 
7 
methanol was injected with a constant flow of N2 (40 mL/min) as the carrier gas. The MTO reaction 
8 
performance was evaluated under normal pressure, 320 °C and a methanol weight hourly space velocity 
9 
(WHSV) of 10 h-1. 
10 
  The reaction products were separated by a gas-liquid separator with an ice-cooled condenser. On-line gas 
11 
chromatography (GC 7900A, Tianmei) with an aluminium oxide (Al2O3) capillary column was used to 
12 
analyse the gas-phase products. The liquid-phase product was analysed by gas chromatography (GC 7900, 
13 
Tianmei) using an FID detector and HP-5 capillary column. The following formula, which was based on 
14 
the carbon balance, was used to calculate the methanol conversion:

3. Results and discussion 
20 
3.1 structural characterization  
21 
The XRD patterns of parent GaZSM-5 and modified GaZSM-5 samples are shown in Fig. 1. It is very 
22 
obvious that all the samples have a typical MFI topology structure. (JCPDS No. 42-0024) and that all 
23 
samples show a high-intensity X-ray diffraction pattern, which infers that all samples display high 
24 
crystallinity. These results show that the alkali treatment did not cause obvious destruction of the zeolite 
25 
structure. In addition, the XRD patterns of the GaZSM-5 and post-treated GaZSM-5 samples show no XRD 
26 
reflections due to the bulk Ga2O3 phase, indicating that the Ga species enter the lattice of the molecular 
27 
sieve and form skeletal atoms or are highly dispersed. The relative crystallinity values of the parent 
28 
GaZSM-5 and post-treated samples are listed in Table 1. The relative crystallinity of GaZSM-5 and 
29 
- 7 - 
post-treated samples gradually decreased as the alkali-treatment concentration increased. This result is 
1 
considered a slight destruction of the zeolite skeleton by the removal of Ga or Si after the post-treatment 
2 
[17]. The crystallinity of the GaZSM5-0.1 and GaZSM5-0.2 samples decreased little, indicating that the 
3 
low alkali concentration hardly caused destruction of the GaZSM-5 molecular sieve structure. The 
4 
crystallinity of the GaZSM5-0.3 sample decreased significantly to 83 %, indicating that the high 
5 
concentration of alkali caused some damage to the GaZSM-5 molecular sieve framework. In addition, a 
6 
broadening of the XRD peaks can be observed in Fig. 1, which indicates that alkali treatment possibly 
7 
results in a decrease in crystal size based on the Scherer equation [18]. 
8 
The unit cell volumes of all samples were determined by the XRD patterns, and the calculated data are 
9 
summarized in Table 1. The unit cell volume data indicate a certain amount of reduction, which illustrates 
10 
the decrease in the pore dimensions after alkali treatment. Moreover, this indicates that the Ga atoms or Al 
11 
atoms were removed through the alkali treatment because the Si-O bonds (0.161 nm) are shorter than the 
12 
Ga-O bonds (0.193 nm) and Al-O bonds (0.175 nm) [19,20]. 
13 
Table 1 shows the XRF results. The Si/Ga ratios of the initial gel are higher than the Si/Ga ratios of the 
14 
parent GaZSM-5 and post-treated GaZSM-5 samples. This illustrates that the Ga atoms are more likely 
15 
than Si atoms to enter the lattice of the zeolite. Additionally, the XRF analysis shows an extremely low Al 
16 
content in the parent GaZSM-5 and post-treated samples because the seed suspension was added. The bulk 
17 
Si/Ga and Si/Al ratios of the GaZSM-5 and post-treated samples gradually decreased as the alkali 
18 
concentration increased. This indicates that some Si species were removed during the alkali treatment.  
19 
Fig. 2 shows the 29Si MAS NMR spectra of the GaZSM-5 and post-treated samples. All samples show 
20 
similar characteristic peaks in the range of -120 to -100 ppm, which are centred as five peaks at 
21 
approximately -102, -106, -109, -112, and -115 ppm according to the literature [21,22]. The peaks at 
22 
approximately -112 and -115 ppm correspond to Framework Q4(0Al) sites. The Q4(1Al) sites give rise to 
23 
the peaks at -106 and -109 ppm. The peak at approximately -102 ppm is attributed to Q3(0Al) sites, which 
24 
are related to the external zeolite surface. [23]. According to the peak area at different positions, the 
25 
formula for calculating Si/(Ga+Al) framework ratios (in Table 1) is as follows: Si/(Ga+Al)NMR = 
26 
Itot/(0.25I1), where Itot is the total intensity of all 29Si NMR signals and I1 is the sum of the Q4(1Al) site 
27 
intensities [24]. 
28 
The value of Si/(Ga+Al)NMR is significantly higher than the bulk Si/(Ga+Al) ratios, which is partly due to 
29 
the use of different test methods. Meanwhile, the high Si/(Ga+Al)NMR ratios suggest that a certain number 
30 
- 8 - 
of extra skeletal gallium oxide species (ex-GaO+) have already been formed. The change trends of the 
1 
Si/(Ga+Al)NMR ratios are different from that of the bulk Si/Ga ratios, which first increase and then decrease. 
2 
The Si/(Ga+Al)NMR ratios of post-treated GaZSM-5 rise from 31.4 for the parent sample to 47.1 and 45.8 
3 
for the GaZSM5-0.1 and GaZSM5-0.2 samples, respectively, indicating that the primary Ga-framework or 
4 
Al-framework species are leached. Furthermore, the Si/(Ga+Al)NMR ratio decreases to 36.6 for 
5 
GaZSM5-0.3 when the alkali concentration is 0.3 M. This indicates that a high concentration of alkali is 
6 
more conducive to the removal of silicon species. The above analysis proves that Si species were leached 
7 
simultaneously with Ga species during the process of alkali treatment. The concentrations of alkali directly 
8 
affected the proportion of removed Si and Ga species. The Ga species was mainly removed when the 
9 
concentration of alkali was low, while high concentrations of alkali easily leached the silicon species, 
10 
which is consistent with the behaviour in previous reports [25,26].  
11 
The properties of the Al species in the parent GaZSM-5 and post-treated zeolites were studied by 27Al 
12 
MAS NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 3). Two peaks at ~54 ppm and ~0 ppm in the 27Al MAS NMR spectra are 
13 
attributed to the tetrahedral Al-framework (F-Al) and extra-framework Al (ex-Al) species, respectively [27]. 
14 
The ex-Al species are considered to the oligomeric alumina with a low degree of hydration/hydroxylation 
15 
[28]. The F-Al contents of the zeolites were calculated from the percentage of F-Al in the integrated peak 
16 
intensities in the 27Al MAS NMR spectra and are listed in Table 2. The GaZSM-5 sample shows a weak 
17 
signal at ~0 ppm, which indicates that the GaZSM-5 sample contains very small amounts of ex-Al species. 
18 
Interestingly, ex-Al species can be obviously observed in the alkali-treated GaZSM-5 samples. A 
19 
conclusion can be drawn that alkali treatment of GaZSM-5 by NaOH effectively leached F-Al and 
20 
generated ex-Al species.  
21 
Based on the XRD, XRF and solid-state NMR characterization analysis, it is observed that a certain 
22 
number of Ga atoms entered the lattice of the ZSM-5 zeolite and replaced the original Al position in the 
23 
HZSM-5 zeolite. The synthetized samples have been proved to be the isomorphic-substituted GaZSM-5 
24 
zeolite. However, a certain number of ex-GaO+ species are inevitably formed. The reducible ex-GaO+ is the 
25 
active centre of dehydrogenation for the Ga-containing zeolite in the MTO reaction. Therefore, the changes 
26 
in the state of the ex-GaO+ species before and after the introduction of H2 were studied to observe their 
27 
reducibility. The H2-TPR curves of bulk Ga2O3 and the prepared samples are shown in Fig. 4. The 
28 
reduction peaks of the Ga2O3 sample occur from 420 °C to 550 °C. Meanwhile, obvious reduction peaks of 
29 
all Ga-containing ZSM-5 zeolites are observed between 420 °C and 650 °C. This indicates that some 
30 
- 9 - 
ex-GaO+ are on the outer surface of the synthesized zeolites. The results show that the content of ex-GaO+ 
1 
significantly decreases with the increase in alkali concentration, indicating that the alkali treatment 
2 
removed additional skeletal Ga species (F-Ga). After careful observation of the peak temperatures, it can be 
3 
found that the peak temperatures of the GaZSM-5 samples are higher than the bulk Ga2O3 reduction 
4 
temperatures. This is due to the strong interaction of ex-GaO+ species with the negative potential of the 
5 
zeolite framework during the calcination process. One pronounced characteristic peak is observed at a 
6 
higher reduction temperature in the 700 °C to 900 °C range, which corresponds to the reduction of the 
7 
ex-GaO+ species located in the channels of the ZSM-5 zeolites.

The parent and modified samples represent common Langmuir isotherms (types IV) associated with 
11 
microporous and mesoporous structures (Fig. 5a). The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherm curves of 
12 
GaZSM5-0.1, GaZSM5-0.2 and GaZSM5-0.3 in Fig. 5a are moved along the y-axis by 20, 40 and 60 cm3 
13 
g-1, respectively, to avoid overlap. The isotherms of all samples show significant hysteresis loops as a 
14 
mesoporous formation. The hysteresis loop becomes increasingly apparent as the alkali concentration 
15 
increases, indicating that increasing the alkali treatment concentration increases the mesoporosity of the 
16 
sample. The formation of mesopores can be attributed to the fact that more skeletal elements are removed 
17 
as the alkali concentration increases.  
18 
The hierarchical GaZSM-5 has a pore size distribution similar to that of the parent GaZSM-5 sample 
19 
(Fig. 5(b)). The main pore size diameters of all samples are about 2.0~6.0 nm. After careful observation of 
20 
the BJH curve, it can be found that the GaZSM-5 and GaZSM5-0.1 are different from the GaZSM5-0.2 and 
21 
GaZSM5-0.3. Few pores have been found at to be larger than 6 nm for GaZSM-5 and GaZSM5-0.1, while 
22 
the BJH pore size distribution curves of GaZSM5-0.2 and GaZSM5-0.3 samples did not return to near the 
23 
baseline at more than 6 nm, indicating that there were widely distributed macropores. Both parent and 
24 
post-treated GaZSM-5 samples show texture data containing a high specific surface area and a high total 
25 
pore volume based on calculations (Table 3). The surface area of the post-treated samples is decreased by 
26 
alkali treatment because of the slight destruction of the framework. In addition, the BET surface areas and 
27 
the micropore surface areas of the GaZSM5-0.1 and GaZSM5-0.2 samples are not significantly lower than 
28 
those of the GaZSM-5, indicating that the structural damage of the two samples is not significant. The BET 
29 
surface area of the GaZSM5-0.3 sample is reduced to 269.9 m2/g, which is mainly attributed to the decrease 
30 
- 10 - 
in external surface area. However, the mesopore volume of GaZSM5-0.3 is obviously increased, although 
1 
the external surface area is significantly reduced. According to the characterization results of XRD, XRF 
2 
and MAS NMR spectra, some Si species and Ga/Al species in the pore channel are removed when the 
3 
concentration of alkali reaches 0.3 M. The decrease in the micropore surface area of GaZSM5-0.3 is 
4 
smaller than the reduction in mesopore volume from Table 3. This indicates that the crystal structure of 
5 
GaZSM5-0.3 has not been seriously damaged. The significantly increased mesopore volume of 
6 
GaZSM5-0.3 is due to the expansion of the micropore volume caused by the leaching of metal elements in 
7 
the pore channel. The decreased external surface area of GaZSM5-0.3 is due to damage to the crystal 
8 
structure and formation of extra-framework oxides.  
9 
SEM images show that the spherical morphology of the parent and post-treated GaZSM-5 samples 
10 
included nanosized crystal aggregation with an individual particle size of approximately 200 nm (Fig. 6) 
11 
[29,30]. This is consistent with the crystal structure of GaZSM-5 molecular sieves prepared by the seed 
12 
method previously reported in the literature [31]. The morphology of the GaZSM-5 sample treated with 
13 
alkali has not substantially changed. Irregular crystals appeared in the GaZSM5-0.3 sample, indicating that 
14 
the alkali treatment causes some extended damage to the zeolite structure.  
15 
The TEM images of the parent and post-treated GaZSM-5 zeolites are shown in Fig. 7. The parent 
16 
GaZSM-5 has fewer shades and spaces than the others, which indicates that fewer mesopores are present in 
17 
the parent GaZSM-5. Some mesopores can be clearly observed in the TEM images of the alkali-treated 
18 
samples, indicating abundant mesopores are produced in the zeolite crystallites. More mesopores are 
19 
generated with increasing alkali concentration. This is consistent with the characterization result of the tN2 
20 
adsorption and the previous literature [32]. Fig. 7(d) shows that the GaZSM5-0.3 has abundant mesopores, 
21 
while preserving its high crystallinity. Fig. 7(e) shows that the mesoporous distribution is very uneven and 
22 
mainly concentrates at 4~16 nm, which is consistent with the results in Fig. 5(b). 
23 
 
24 
3.3 Acidities 
25 
Fig. 8 shows the acidity of all the zeolite samples that were investigated by NH3-TPD profiles. The 
26 
NH3-TPD profiles are usually deconvoluted to two Gauss fitting distribution peaks in the range of 180 °C 
27 
to 550 °C. The low temperature peak of 180-260 °C is related to weak acid sites, and the high temperature 
28 
peak of 350-450 °C corresponds to strong acid sites. After alkali treatment, the position and size of the 
29 
NH3-TPD peaks slightly change, indicating that the acid strength of all samples is similar. The number of 
30 
- 11 - 
weak and strong acid sites can be estimated by the peak areas when an NH3 molecule is assumed to 
1 
correspond to an acid site (Table 4). The amounts of strong acid sites successively decrease for the 
2 
GaZSM5, GaZSM5-0.1 and GaZSM5-0.2 samples, indicating that Ga/Al species are mainly leached from 
3 
the Si-OH-Ga or Si-OH-Al groups. The numbers of weak acid sites simultaneously decrease for the 
4 
GaZSM5-0.1 and GaZSM5-0.2 samples, indicating that some ex-GaO+ or ex-Al species are removed. The 
5 
total acid sites of the GaZSM5-0.3 samples, especially the strong acid sites, significantly increase. 
6 
According to the results of the MAS NMR and N2 adsorption/desorption, this increase indicates that 
7 
skeletal Si species are removed and partially deposited in the zeolite, which forms the extra-framework 
8 
species.  
9 
To further discriminate between the Brønsted acid and Lewis acid sites, FTIR spectra of the adsorbed 
10 
pyridine were also obtained (Fig. 9). In the present work, pyridine is an adaptive precursor molecule, since 
11 
the diameter of pyridine is similar to that of the ZSM-5 zeolite (5.5) but larger than that of the benzene ring 
12 
(2.8); thus, it can be close to the internal porosity of zeolite. More importantly, it is a rather hard base with 
13 
nitrogen lone electron pairs and may form PyL coordination species at Lewis acid sites and PyH+ pyridine 
14 
ions at proton sites. The adsorption of pyridine on Brønsted acid sites produces bands in the region of 
15 
approximately 1540 cm-1, and pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites produces a characteristic band at 
16 
approximately 1450 cm-1. The band at 1490 cm-1 is thought to be a joint contribution of a Brønsted acid site 
17 
and a Lewis acid site. [33] The concentrations of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites were calculated from the 
18 
area of the bands at 1450 cm−1 and 1540 cm−1 (Table 4). The measurements revealed significantly 
19 
decreased amounts of pyridine bound to Brønsted acid sites for GaZSM5-0.1 and GaZSM5-0.2 samples. 
20 
Decreases of 19 % and 31 % relative to that of the parent GaZSM-5 sample were observed for the samples 
21 
treated in 0.1 M and 0.2 M NaOH, respectively. The amount of Brønsted acid sites of GaZSM5-0.3 
22 
significantly increased, reaching 1.07 mmol/g, which is due to the removal of Si-framework species. The 
23 
trends identified from these spectra are the same as those observed for NH3-TPD. This is consistent with 
24 
the change of strong acid sites tested by NH3-TPD and indicates that mainly F-Ga or F-Al species are 
25 
removed when the concentrations of alkali were 0.1 M and 0.2 M. Lewis acidity displays the same trend, 
26 
initially decreasing from 0.70 mmol/g for the parent GaZSM-5 to 0.56 mmol/g for the GaZSM5-0.1 and 
27 
0.50 mmol/g for the GaZSM5-0.2 but subsequently increasing with increasing treatment concentration. 
28 
This indicates that a certain amount of ex-GaO+ and ex-Al species were removed simultaneously. The 
29 
simultaneous increase in Lewis acidity and Brønsted acidity of the GaZSM5-0.3 are likely the result of 
30 
- 12 - 
improved pyridine accessibility to acid sites associated with Si-O-Al framework species in the mesoporous 
1 
samples. This explanation is consistent with the variations in mesoporosity detected by nitrogen 
2 
physisorption.  
3 
Fig. 10 shows that the FTIR spectra in the -OH region of the samples have three key peaks in the range 
4 
of 3800-3500 cm-1, which appear at approximately 3610 cm-1, 3660 cm-1 and 3750 cm-1. According to the 
5 
literature [34,35], the peak at 3610 cm-1 represents Si-OH-Al, which is assigned to Brønsted acidic OH. As 
6 
the alkali concentration increases, the peak intensity of Brønsted acidic OH generally shows a decreasing 
7 
trend. This indicates that a certain amount of F-Ga and F-Al species were removed. This is consistent with 
8 
the previous characterization results. The peak at 3660 cm-1 represents Al-OH, corresponding to the ex-Al 
9 
species. The Al-OH peak intensities of all samples are weak, indicating a small amount of ex-Al species. 
10 
The peak at 3750 cm-1 corresponds to Si-OH species. A successively enhanced peak corresponding to 
11 
Si-OH is observed as the alkali concentration increased. The enhanced peak of Si-OH is due to the 
12 
generation of new structure defects on the out surface of the zeolites.  
13 
 
14 
3.4 Catalytic performance 
15 
The changing of conversions for MTO reaction with time over parent GaZSM-5 and post-treated 
16 
samples are shown in Fig. 11. The Fig. 12 shows the XRD pattern of the deactivated catalysts. All 
17 
deactivated catalysts have maintained high crystallinity, which indicates that the crystal structure of zeolites 
18 
in the reaction has not been significantly damaged and the deactivation of zeolites is mainly due to coking. 
19 
The catalyst lifetimes of GaZSM5-0.1 and GaZSM5-0.2 are remarkable extended because of the improved 
20 
diffusivity and decreased strong acidity amount by Ga leaching. The GaZSM5-0.2 shows the longest 
21 
catalytic life among that of the four catalysts, retains a conversion above 99 % for 12 h and has a 
22 
deactivation that is quite slow. The considerably increase of catalyst lifetime for the post-treatment sample 
23 
is consistent with previously reports. However, the catalytic activity of the GaZSM5-0.3 is significantly 
24 
lower than that of the other samples. The GaZSM5-0.3 has the highest number of strong acid sites, high 
25 
mesopore volumes and low relative crystallinity. The conversion falls below 40 % after reacting 30 h. It 
26 
indicates that the excess acidity in GaZSM5-0.3 facilitates obviously coke deposition, although 
27 
GaZSM5-0.3 has a high mesopore volume. Thus, the catalyst lifetime is affected by both diffusion and 
28 
zeolite acidity [36].    
29 
The detailed aromatic and aliphatic product selectivity of the MTO reaction at 8 h is shown in Fig. 13. 
30 
- 13 - 
The mechanism for the MTO reaction over zeolite catalysts is quite complex and has been extensively 
1 
discussed in the literature [37,38]. The hydrocarbon pool mechanism has been widely recognized [39]. In 
2 
this mechanism, the reaction is divided into alkene-based and aromatic-based cycles, which can explain the 
3 
formation of olefins and the distribution of products under the catalysis of zeolite with special pore 
4 
structure and acidity. 
5 
The product distribution of MTO is closely related to the pore structure and acidity of the zeolite catalyst 
6 
because the topology of the zeolite molecular sieve limits the molecular size and reactivity generated by 
7 
HCP [40]. The selectivity of propylene can be improved by adding Ga into zeolite and forming H (Ga) 
8 
ZSM-5 zeolite according to the literature [41]. The selectivities for CH4 and C2H6 of all samples are less 
9 
than 1 %. This indicates that the cracking activity of C2-C4 olefins is very low. GaZSM5-0.1 and 
10 
GaZSM5-0.2 have slightly lower selectivities for C2 and C3 olefins compared with those of the parent 
11 
GaZSM-5, which is attributed to a decreased Lewis acid content. Fig. 13 shows that the selectivities of C2 
12 
and C3 olefin are consistent with the change of Lewis acid amount. However, although the selectivity of C4 
13 
olefin also mainly comes from the hydrogen transfer reaction, the change of C4 selectivity is different from 
14 
that of the C2 and C3 selectivity, which is mainly reflected in the GaZSM5-0.3 catalyst. The selectivity of 
15 
C2 and C3 olefin for GaZSM5-0.3 catalyst increased significantly, while the selectivity of C4 olefin 
16 
decreased slightly, indicating that the increase of Lewis acid amount mainly promoted the generation of C2 
17 
and C3 olefin. In an MTO reaction, a Lewis acid has no catalytic activity and generally has a synergistic 
18 
effect with a Brønsted acid. Strong acid sites have high catalytic activity, but they easily produce coke 
19 
deposition reactions. According to Liu's report, the formation of dimethylether from methanol is directly 
20 
related to a weak acid site, which is beneficial to the formation of an initial C-C bond and the conversion of 
21 
methanol in the initial reaction stage [42]. Weak acid sites are also conducive to alkylation and methylation 
22 
reactions, resulting in the cracking reaction of C5+, and the selectivity of ethylene and propylene will 
23 
increase accordingly [43]. In addition, this behaviour can slow the coking rate and prolong the catalyst life. 
24 
However, having an excessive number of weak acid sites is not conducive to the conversion of methanol. 
25 
Butane, other alkanes and aromatics are usually produced as by-products. The selectivity for these 
26 
by-products depends largely on the structure and acidity of the catalysts [42,44]. GaZSM5-0.3 has higher 
27 
selectivities for C6 and C6+ compared with those of the other samples, which are mainly attributed to an 
28 
increased number of Brønsted acid sites and larger pore structures. Oxygen transfer and aromatization of 
29 
low-carbon olefins occur due to excessive acidity, and the larger pore structure enables the pore to 
30 
- 14 - 
accommodate more aromatics and the formation of coke.

Conclusions  
3 
In this paper, hierarchical GaZSM-5 zeolites were successfully synthesized by a desilication method with 
4 
different concentrations of sodium hydroxide. The parent GaZSM-5 and post-treated GaZSM-5 were 
5 
characterized and used for a methanol to olefins conversion reaction. From the results of the 
6 
characterization, abundant mesopores were generated by the post-treatment with an appropriate 
7 
concentration of alkali (0.1 and 0.2 M NaOH), and the number of acid sites decreased. Because of the 
8 
mesoporosity increase and the acid concentration decrease, the lifetime of the catalyst increases. However, 
9 
an excessively high concentration of alkali (0.3 M NaOH) caused low crystallinity and excessive acidity 
10 
despite a high mesoporous volume, which is conducive to the formation of aromatic products and coking. 
11 
In addition, desilication significantly affects the product selectivity and the selectivities of C2 and C3 olefin 
12 
are consistent with the change of Lewis acid amount.
