Abstract
Several reconstructions of catalytic active sites in gallium-exchanged mordenite have been analyzed using periodic density
functional theory method. It is found that a number of structures in which gallium is present as Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and
Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx can be reached under alkane dehydrogenation conditions. The transition barrier for the rate determining step in
alkane dehydrogenation are evaluated. The values indicate that these gallium structures can catalyze alkane dehydrogenation
and suggest an alternative reaction route in addition to those that have been proposed before. To cite this article: X. Rozanska

Résumé
Différentes reconstructions de sites catalytiquement actifs dans une mordénite échangée avec des cations contenant du gal-
lium ont été analysées à l’aide d’une méthode périodique faisant appel à la théorie de la fonctionnelle de la densité. Différentes
structures, dans lesquelles le gallium est présent sous forme de Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx et Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx, peuvent être atteintes
dans les conditions de la réaction de déshydrogénation des alcanes. Ces structures sont testées dans le cadre de l’activation de
l’état de transition, qui est l’étape déterminante pour la vitesse de réaction de déshydrogénation de l’éthane. Ces reconstructions
peuvent catalyser la déshydrogénation des alcanes. Les résultats suggèrent un chemin réactionnel alternatif à ce qui a été proposé
précédemment. Pour citer cet article : X. Rozanska et al., C. R. Chimie 8 (2005).

1. Introduction
Dehydrogenation of alkanes is an important reac-
tion as it constitutes the starting point in the conversion
of cheap and abundant chemical compounds into valu-
able products. Oleﬁns that are obtained from dehydro-
genation of alkanes are precursors in ﬁne organic chem-
istry, or polymers synthesis [1].Among other catalysts,
zeolites have been shown to catalyze this reactions. Zeo-
lites are microporous aluminosilicates built up by link-
ing SiO4 tetahedra together by sharing oxygen atoms
[2]. They exist as such naturally or can be obtained syn-
thetically. The presence of aluminum is a prerequisite
for zeolite showing catalytic activity [3]. When alumi-
num substitution occurs, the resulting negative charge
in excess is balanced by the introduction of cations in
the micropores. These cations can be of different nature
and will govern the catalytic activity. Normally, sodium
is present as charge compensating cation but it can vir-
tually be exchanged with any other cation [2,4].A well-
known example is the exchange with ammonium ion
which will leave proton as charge-compensating cat-
ion after desorption of ammonia and renders a solid
acid catalyst. Alternatively, also gallium can be em-
ployed as charge-compensating cation [5].
Although sodium or proton-exchanged zeolites also
shows some catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reac-
tions [6], the activity is rather low due to the high bar-
riers associated with the generation of carbonium ions.
Gallium-exchanged zeolites allow higher dehydroge-
nation activities [5,7]. Nevertheless, high reaction tem-
peratures are still needed because of the endothermic
nature of dehydrogenation reactions [8]. Moreover, con-
version of alkanes leads to the formation of aromatic
when the reaction is catalyzed by gallium-exchanged
zeolite [7,9]. The commercial Cyclar process uses this
class of catalyst [10].
The details of the reaction mechanisms and the
nature of the gallium active sites in these reactions are
not precisely known [11,12]. However, the structure of
gallium in the zeolitic precursors is understood to a bet-
ter extent. Gallium is present as Ga(III). The gallium
cation in tetrahedral position is connected to two hydro-
gen and interacts with two oxygen atoms of an AlO4
tetrahedron (Scheme 1). During alkanes dehydrogena-
tion, the structure of the catalytic site becomes more
complex. The ﬁrst reason for this is that high tempera-
ture is required to achieve the reaction, which blurred
signiﬁcantly a clear identiﬁcation of reaction interme-
diates and lead to reconstructions of the catalytic active
site [13].
Frash and Van Santen have performed a quantum
chemical study of the dehydrogenation of ethane by
gallium-exchanged zeolite [11]. For this purpose, they
used as model of the gallium-exchanged zeolite cata-
lyst a small molecular fragment within the framework
of the cluster approach [14,15].Various structural alter-
natives of the active site were compared and the com-
plete catalytic cycle for dehydrogenation was com-
pleted. The most likely reaction sequence is depicted
in Scheme 2. The limiting step in dehydrogenation of
ethane catalyzed by a gallium-exchanged zeolite clus-
ter model corresponds to a transition state structure that
leads to the formation of ethene from ethyl chemi-
sorbed to GaH-Z, where Z is the zeolite cluster (see
TS3 in Scheme 2). One notices that the energy barrier
of the rate-limiting step in this reaction pathway is par-
ticularly high. A possible reason for this is probably
inherent to the cluster approach method. It is now well
understood that the zeolite framework can have a sig-
niﬁcant stabilizing effect of transition state structures
[15,16]. In the cluster approach method, activation
energy barriers are generally overestimated as the zeo-
lite framework is not described. However, if on the one
hand the zeolite framework stabilizes charge separa-
tion in transition states of carbocationic nature [17], on
the other hand, absence of stabilization or even desta-
bilization can occur for transition states of different
nature [18]. A closer look at this reaction pathway
reveals other interesting facts. The Int2 intermediate
has been considered to be an intimately associated com-
plex, whereas, considering the bond order in this struc-
ture it might equally be considered to be a zeolite Brøn-
sted site on which is physisorbed a GaH3 molecule
(Scheme 2). The gas phase cluster approach method
has a tendency to overemphasize interactions between
the different fragments as they cannot behave differ-
ently due to the limited size of the system. In a zeolite

micropore, there is room for more favorable arrange-
ments.
In this study, we will use periodic density functional
theory to describe the zeolite framework as realisti-
cally as possible. We will check different alternatives
of the reconstruction of gallium-exchanged zeolite. We
select mordenite as zeolite framework because it has a
small unit cell [19,20]. Experimentally, mordenite and
ZSM-5 are employed in the conversion of alkanes into
aromatics [9,21].
In addition to the periodic density functional theory
calculations, we will perform few gas-phase cluster cal-
culations to check the viability of some structures as
potential active sites in dehydrogenation. We will use a
similar model and similar methods as those used by
Frash and Van Santen [11] to ease comparison.
2. Methods
The periodic density functional theory calculations
are performed employing the Vienna ab initio simula-
tion package (VASP) [22–24]. The total energy is cal-
culated solving the Kohn–Sham equations using the
local exchange-correlation functional proposed by Per-
dew and Zunger [25]. The results are corrected for non-
locality in the generalized gradient approximation with
the Perdew-Wang functional (PW91) [26]. VASP uses
plane waves, and ultrasoft pseudopotentials [27]. A
300 eV energy-cutoff and a Brillouin-zone sampling
restricted to the C-point were selected in our calcula-
tions.
Relaxation of the adsorbed compounds and interme-
diates was performed employing a quasi-Newton algo-
rithm based on analytical forces minimization. Conver-
gence was assumed to be reached when all forces were
below 0.05 eV/Å.
As previously mentioned, we selected mordenite as
host structure for the gallium-cations. The unit cell of
the periodically repeated image of the system is deﬁned
as
a = 13.648 Å,
b = 13.672 Å,
c = 15.105 Å,
 = 96.792°, b = 90.003°, and c = 90.022°. The details
of the optimization of the mordenite unit cell can be
found elsewhere [20]. In the unit cell, two aluminum
substitute tetrahedrally coordinated silicon atoms. They
are located at the junction of the 12-membered ring side
pocket. When an aluminum substitution takes place on
one side of the 12-membered ring channel, the next one
takes place on the opposite side (Fig. 1), therefore
respecting the Loewenstein [28] rule.
A main reason why periodic density functional
theory method has been chosen is that we are going to
investigate different possible reconstructions of the
gallium-exchanged zeolite catalyst. It is known that den-
sity functional theory is poorly suited to account for
Van der Waals contribution. This has some conse-
quences on the results that is, however, balanced by the
uniform shift that is generally obtained when Van der
Waals contribution is correctly described [29].An alter-
native to pure density functional theory would be to

use QM/MM or QM/QM method. [29,30] However, in
the present case, this is actually not really suitable as
we cannot a priori deﬁne what will be the sufﬁcient
and self-consistent size of the part of the system that
needs high accuracy QM description.
In the present study, we will ﬁrst consider a morden-
ite unit cell in which the compensating cation at the
aluminum substituted tetrahedral is GaH2
+. Then, we
will add a GaH3 molecule to the systems. Lastly, incor-
poration of propene and H2 within the micropore will
be considered. For each of the three systems, recon-
struction of the catalytic active sites in gallium-
exchanged mordenite will be investigated.
To support the relevance of the reconstructed cata-
lytic sites in the dehydrogenation of alkane, we have
also performed gas-phase calculations. For these cal-
culations, we have employed similar method and a simi-
lar model as those in the study of Frash and Van Santen
[11]. This allows a comparison with their values. We
used the Gaussian98 [31] package with the B3LYP
method [32] and 6-31g basis set [33]. With these cal-
culations we are not interested in quantitative values
but qualitative ones. Therefore, this limited approach
is self-sufﬁcient. It is known that zeolite framework can
seriously shift the energies of transition state structures
or sterically hindered intermediates [15,16]. However,
our objective in the present study is not to investigate
these effects but to propose and analyze reconstruc-
tions of gallium-exchanged zeolite and to check whether
or not they are relevant in the catalytic cycle of alkane
dehydrogenation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Reconstructions in gallium-exchanged
mordenite
In its most stable conﬁguration in zeolite, Ga3+
adopts a tetrahedral coordination [5,11].Within the zeo-
lite micropores after reductive treatment, GaH2
+ inter-
acts with two oxygen atoms of an aluminum tetrahe-
dral unit (Fig. 1a and Scheme 1). Two GaH2
+ adopting
this conformation are set in our mordenite unit cell,
which contains two aluminum atoms at the locations
as described before. This system is shown in Fig. 1a
and the most important geometrical parameters are
reported in Table 1a. The oxygen-gallium bond length
distances range from 2.02 to 2.04 Å. This is slightly
larger than that was found by Frash and Van Santen in
their quantum chemical study using aAl(OHSiH3)2H2
–
zeolite model [11].

It is possible to generate a Brønsted acidic site start-
ing from a [GaH2]-zeolite structure [34]. We have
checked the reconstruction in which [Ga(III)H2]-MOR
evolves toward H-MOR (Figs. 1 and 2). It is known
that gallium-exchanged zeolite at high temperature can
evolve toward the formation of metallic gallium, i.e.
reduction of Ga(III) to Ga(0) [35]. García-Sánchez et al.
[36] have suggested that Ga(III)Hx species can evolve
toward Ga(II), Ga(I) and eventually to Ga(0) under reduc-
ing conditions. As we will show, this reconstruction to
H-MOR and Ga(I)H is not very stable. Therefore, we
have considered conditions under which the reconstruc-
tion of [GaH2]-MOR to reduced Ga could be stabi-
lized.
Potential reconstructions have been checked employ-
ing periodic density functional theory calculations and
are displayed in Fig. 1. Initially, the unreconstructed
species in mordenite is a system where two [Ga(III)H2]-
MOR are present (Fig. 1a). This site can decompose to
H-MOR and Ga(I)H. To stabilize GaH, we have consid-
ered its association with [Ga(III)H2]-MOR, leading to a
system in which Ga(I) is reoxidized (Fig. 1b and
Table 1b). The [GaH2GaH]-MOR species is in essence
similar to the intermediate [i-C2H6-GaH]-MOR in the
ethane dehydrogenation reaction pathway (Int3 in

Scheme 2) [11]. The energy of this system is
+136 kJ/mol with respect to the unreconstructed sys-
tem. [Ga(II)H2Ga(II)H]-MOR can evolve through hydro-
gen transfer to a system having both Ga(I) and Ga(III): a
GaH3 molecule can be formed leaving [Ga(I)] coordi-
nated to the zeolite wall (Fig. 1c). The main geometri-
cal parameters of this structure can be seen in Table 1c.
The energy for this structure is +128 kJ/mol with respect
to the initial unreconstructed system.
The calculations show that the non-assisted reduc-
tion of Ga(III) is quite highly energetic. However, one
notices that comparable energy reaction intermediates
are present in the catalytic cycle of ethane dehydroge-
nation (Scheme 2) [11]. Hence, it remains possible that
these reconstructions occur under reaction conditions.
However, before such reconstructions as seen in
Fig. 1b, c can occur, H-MOR and GaH must be formed.
Using a mordenite unit cell with a single aluminum
atom and a [Ga(III)H2]-MOR as starting point, we have
evaluated the reaction energy to reach H-MOR and GaH
(Fig. 2). The geometry details are not reported here as
they are rather straightforward: the systems can be
described as H-MOR and GaH present in the micropore.
The free GaH molecule has no signiﬁcant effect on the
zeolite framework. The GaH bond length is 1.67 Å.
More important is the energy of this structure: it is
+215 kJ/mol with respect to [Ga(III)H2]-MOR. Consid-
ering this energy, spontaneous reduction of [Ga(III)H2]-
MOR to Ga(I)H and H-MOR is unlikely. This is in line
with the experimentally observations that show that
such transformation only occurs under reducing condi-
tions and at high temperature [35].
3.2. Reconstructions in gallium-exchange mordenite
in presence of GaH3
Next, we analyze different alternatives that allow the
reconstruction of the Ga(III) dihydrate species with assis-
tance of external molecules. The ancillary molecules
include GaH3 and H2 and propene.
As a ﬁrst ancillary molecule for reconstruction of
[Ga(III)H2]-MOR, GaH3 is considered (Fig. 3). In the
initial system, two [Ga(III)H2]-MOR and GaH3 are
present (Fig. 3a). The [Ga(III)H2]-MOR are similar to
those reported before (Fig. 1a and Table 1a). The energy
of [Ga(III)H2]-MOR and GaH3 is used as energy refer-
ence. We observe that the formation of H-MOR and
Ga(I)H is probably prevented because of the high energy
that is required to reach this structure. Here, GaH can
associate with GaH3, leading to the formation of
[GaH3·GaH] and H-MOR (Fig. 3b and Table 2). The
energy of this system is +164 kJ/mol. This corresponds
to an energy stabilization energy of around 50 kJ/mol
with respect to the energy of formation of H-MOR and
GaH. A proton jump can transform Ga(III)H3·Ga(I)H in
Ga(II)H2–Ga(II)H2 (Fig. 3c). Then, the energy of the sys-
tem becomes +144 kJ/mol, corresponding to a
20-kJ/mol stabilization of the energy with respect to its
previous state. The reaction energies for these recon-
structions of [Ga(III)H2]-MOR are now on the same
order of magnitude as the reaction energies in alkane
dehydrogenation [11].
3.3. Reconstructions in gallium-exchanged
mordenite in presence of propene and hydrogen
The last series of periodic density functional theory
calculations were performed on the reconstruction of

two [Ga(III)H2]-MOR, propene, and H2 (Fig. 4). It is
important to mention that alkanes dehydrogenation pro-
duces H2 [37], which probably keeps the catalyst under
reductive conditions. From the starting system, genera-
tion of a zeolite Brønsted acidic site was considered.
The energy of the initial structure was used as energy
reference (Fig. 4a).
Previously, GaH3 was used as hydrogen source to
assist in the generation of the Brønsted acidic site. Here,
H2 is directly used for this purpose. [Ga(III)H2]-MOR
and H2 dissociate leading to the formation of GaH3 and
H-MOR (Fig. 4b). The energy of this system is
+108 kJ/mol. It is known that propene is readily proto-
nated in protonic zeolite [38]. Moreover, the propyl car-
bocation is not stable in zeolite and eventually chemi-
sorbs to Z– where Z– is the deprotonated Brønsted acidic
site [39]. This GaH3 [Ga(III)H2]-MOR, and [i-C3H7]-
MOR system was checked (Fig. 4c). It leads to an even
more stable intermediate as expected because of the
exothermic propene chemisorption to H-zeolite corre-
sponding to an energy is +65 kJ/mol.
The GaH3 molecule that is generated here may be
involved in the [Ga(III)H2]-MOR reconstruction as
shown in Fig. 3. Also, a reconstruction of [Ga(III)H2]-
MOR as shown in Fig. 1 may be relevant. We have only
considered the situation where GaH3 associates to
[Ga(III)H2]-MOR to lead to the formation of
[Ga(II)H2Ga(II)H]-MOR (Fig. 4d). The energy of this
system is +114 kJ/mol with respect to the energy ref-
erence structure. This means that the reaction of forma-
tion of [Ga(II)H2Ga(II)H]-MOR from GaH3 and
[Ga(III)H2]-MOR is only around 50 kJ/mol. This de-
crease in energy is partly obtained because of the exo-
thermic nature of the formation of the alkoxy species.
Moreover, it can be seen that the reconstruction of
[Ga(III)H2]-MOR to other structures in the presence of
propene and H2, both products of alkane dehydrogena-
tion, have energies that are equivalent or lower than
that of reaction intermediates in alkane dehydrogena-
tion (Scheme 2) [11]. However, the generation of alkoxy
and eventually of aromatics compounds results in a
favorable thermodynamic driving force when propene
is present.
3.4. Dehydrogenation activity of the reconstructed
sites
At the moment it is not know whether these inter-
mediates are kinetically relevant if the activation ener-

gies in alkane dehydrogenation are considered. To give
some insight in the answer we performed small gas-
phase and cluster approach calculations using similar
method as employed by Frash and Van Santen [11].
The results of these calculations are summarized in
Schemes 3 and 4. In Scheme 3, reaction (1) is the dehy-
drogenation step from the study of Frash andVan Santen
[11]. From the transition state in reaction (1), we derive
the transition states for reactions (2) to (5). Ga(III)H2–
C2H5 dissociates to Ga(III)H3 and C2H4 in reaction (2).
The activation energy corrected from zero point energy,
the activation enthalpy and free energy at 298 K are
reported in Scheme 3. One observes that the activation
energy barrier for this step is around 110 kJ/mol lower
than that of [Ga(III)HC2H5]-Z to [GaH2]-Z and ethyl-
ene. Interestingly, this decrease in activation energy
matches roughly the reaction energy associated with
the generation of ‘free’ Ga(III) from Ga(III)-MOR as
obtained in the periodic density functional theory cal-
culations (Fig. 3c). However, a reaction following the
reaction pathway as suggested in reaction (2) might be
kinetically preferred over reaction (1). Reaction (2) can
also be used as a reference to check how the reconstruc-
tion and association of gallium atoms in mordenite as
shown in Fig. 1b, c, and Fig. 3c will affect the reaction
energy barrier in the rate determining step of the dehy-
drogenation catalytic cycle (Scheme 2) [11]. In reac-
tion (3), the same reaction is considered when the acti-
vation occurs by a –Ga(II)HGa(II)H2 instead of –Ga(III)H2
(Scheme 3). The activation energy decreases by around
20 kJ/mol with respect to the activation energy in reac-
tion (2). When the reaction is activated by –Ga(II-
)HGa(0), the decrease of the activation energy is even
more important (reaction (4) in Scheme 3) and becomes
around 60 kJ/mol compared to the activation energy
barrier in reaction (2).
Finally, we checked the same step in the case of acti-
vation by –Ga(I) (reaction (5) in Scheme 3). For this
situation no decrease in activation energy is observed
but a higher energy barrier is obtained.
A further point to be discussed is the ease of forma-
tion of the Ga(I) cation. The conversion of Ga(II)H2–
Ga(II)H2 to Ga(III)H3·Ga(I)H is indeed relatively easy
(reaction (1) in Scheme 4). Considering the order of
magnitude of the activation energies that are required
in alkane dehydrogenation (Scheme 2), this suggests
that an equilibrium between Ga(II)H2–Ga(II)H2 and
Ga(III)H3·Ga(I)H is obtained under reaction conditions.
Starting from Ga(III)H3·Ga(I)H, further dehydroge-
nation can be achieved (reaction (2) in Scheme 4). This
step is energetically more demanding with an activa-
tion energy around 104 kJ/mol. However, this remains

well below the activation energies that are identiﬁed in
alkane dehydrogenation (Scheme 2 and Scheme 3).
Therefore, it appears that the reconstructions of gal-
lium sites as proposed in the periodic density func-
tional theory calculations can catalyze alkane dehydro-
genation. Considering the limited models that were
employed here, more studies must be achieved to truly
clarify the role of the reconstructions in catalysis. How-
ever, the reaction energy of the gallium reconstruc-
tions, i.e. 101–128 kJ/mol for the most stable recon-
structions, is well below the reaction energy of ethane
dehydrogenation, i.e. 134 kJ/mol. The reconstructions
are thermodynamically more favorable than alkane
dehydrogenation.
Another interesting result is that the activation energy
for the reaction of [Ga(III)HC2H5]-Z to C2H4 and
[Ga(III)H2]-Z is higher than that of systems in which
Ga(III) is not chemisorbed to the zeolite. This suggests
that an alternative reaction route from Int2 in Scheme 2
is possible. This reaction route might follow the se-
quence Int1–TS1–Int2 as in Scheme 2. Then, the route
would fold toward a transition state structure as in reac-
tion (2) (Scheme 3). Using the same energy reference
as in Scheme 2, there is no energy gain in this reaction
route. However, when one considers that a previously
formed oleﬁn can chemisorb to the zeolite Brønsted
acidic site that is hence made available, this leads to a
stabilization of the system by around 25–40 kJ/mol
[15,16]. This alternative reaction route becomes kineti-
cally dominant. It would result in the formation of
GaH3, C2H4, and H-Z. The last step in this reaction
route is then the restoration of the initial catalytic site,
namely [GaH2]-Z, from GaH3 and H-Z. We performed
the calculation for this transition state which is in
Fig. 4. Geometries and energies of [Ga(III)H2]-MOR, [Ga(III)H2]-MOR, propene, and H2 (A), [Ga(III)H2]-MOR, H-MOR, GaH3, and propene

density functional theory calculations.

essence similar to TS2 in Scheme 2. We did not put
GaH3 in contact with H-Z because the optimization of
GaH3 physisorbed to H-Z, where Z is AlH2(SiH3)2
–,
resulted in an unrealistic deformation and interactions
of the cluster due to its limited size. We found an acti-
vation energy for this reaction of 128 kJ/mol
(DHact = 131 kJ/mol and DGact = 84 kJ/mol at 298 K).
This last step again does not constitute a rate determin-
ing step as demanding as Int3 to TS3 in Scheme 2.
4. Conclusions
We have performed a quantum chemical analysis of
various structural changes of gallium-exchanged
mordenite using periodic density functional theory
method. It appears that these reconstructions exhibit
relatively high reaction energies. However, those high
energy intermediates are reachable when they are set
in the perspective of the alkane dehydrogenation cata-
Scheme 3. Reaction intermediates and transition states and their energies as obtained in the calculations when different gallium-based molecules
are tested in the rate limiting step of the ethane dehydrogenation reaction. Eact is the activation energy barrier corrected from zero point energy.
DHact and DGact are enthalpy and free energy of activation at 298 K, respectively. All values are in kJ/mol.

lytic cycle. A succession of Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Hx, and
Ga(I)Hx intermediates have almost equivalent energies.
Some of these intermediates can lead to enhanced rates
of dehydrogenation. Especially, it appears that conden-
sation of gallium to dimeric species can reduce the acti-
vation energy of the rate determining step in alkane
dehydrogenation. Moreover, non-coordinated to the
zeolite gallium species are observed to be more active
than when they are chemisorbed to a zeolite aluminum
oxide tetrahedron. The generation of alkoxy results in
a favorable thermodynamic driving force in the sys-
tem. Based on these results, an alternative reaction route
in alkane dehydrogenation that goes through direct
decomposition of GaH2CyHz (see Int2 in Scheme 2) to
oleﬁn and GaH3 is proposed. The gallium species is
then restored to the chemisorbed state with assistance
of a zeolitic Brønsted acidic site. When dimeric gal-
lium species are involved, the reaction goes through
decomposition of Ga2HxCyHz to oleﬁn and Ga2Hx+1.
The restoration of the catalytically active gallium-
exchanged by a zeolitic Brønsted acidic site follows
the same sequence as with monomeric species.
