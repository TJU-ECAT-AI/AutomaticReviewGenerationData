 reveal
that
 the  activities
 of In2O3–Ga2O3 catalysts

 Introduction
The
 catalytic
 dehydrogenation
 of
 short-chain
 hydrocarbons
such
 as
 light
 alkanes
 is
 an
 effective
 way
 to
 increase
 the
 value
 of
light
 alkane
 streams
 from
 fossil-based
 sources.
 Dehydrogenation
is
 of
 renewed
 interest
 due
 to
 the
 large
 availability
 of
 new
 feed-
stocks
 derived
 from
 hydraulic
 fracturing
 (‘fracking’)
 operations
 [1].
Among
 this
 family
 of
 reactions,
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 (PDH)
is
 of
 particular
 interest,
 since
 propylene
 is
 a
 crucial
 feedstock
 for
polymer
 production
 [2].
 Total
 propylene
 consumption
 was
 83
 mil-
lion
 tons
 in
 2013
 and
 the
 global
 demand
 is
 forecast
 to
 grow
 at
 a
CAGR
 of
 4.8%
 during
 2013–2018
 [3].
Oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 (ODH)
 of
 propane
 is
 an
 alternate
way
 to
 produce
 propylene.
 In
 this
 scenario,
 an
 oxidative
 gas
 (O2
or
 CO2)
 is
 co-fed
 with
 propane.
 This
 process
 has
 several
 advan-
tages,
 such
 as
 being
 exothermic
 and
 offering
 no
 thermodynamic
limitations.
 However,
 this
 approach
 is
 faced
 with
 problematic

over-oxidation
 (combustion),
 which
 can
 decrease
 propylene
 pro-
ductivity.
 The
 most
 extensively
 studied
 catalysts
 involve
 Mo/V/Ce
based
 oxides
 [4–7].
 An
 array
 of
 alternate
 catalysts
 also
 continue
to
 be
 explored,
 such
 as
 metallic
 alloy
 (i.e.,
 Cu–Al)
 catalysts
 [8]
and
 intermetallic
 (i.e.,
 Cu–Sn,
 Cu–Fe–Al)
 ﬁbers
 [9].
 Several
 reviews
focus
 on
 discussing
 ODH
 approaches
 in
 detail
 [10–12].
Non-oxidative
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 is
 an
 endothermic
 and
equilibrium-limited
 process
 that
 requires
 relatively
 high
 tempera-
ture
 and
 low
 pressure
 conditions
 to
 obtain
 a
 high
 yield
 of
 propylene.
The
 main
 issues
 associated
 with
 PDH
 under
 such
 conditions
 are
undesired
 thermal
 cracking
 of
 the
 feedstock
 and
 products
 (produc-
ing
 short-chain
 hydrocarbons)
 as
 well
 as
 coke
 formation,
 which
blocks
 active
 sites
 and
 causes
 rapid
 catalyst
 deactivation
 [13].
Currently,
 commercial
 industrial
 PDH
 processes
 are
 based
 on
 Cr
[14,15]
 (CATOFIN® from
 CB&I
 Lummus)
 and
 Ptcatalysts
 [16–18]
(Oleﬂex
 from
 UOP)
 catalysts.
 However,
 these
 catalytic
 systems
 are
impacted
 by
 rapid
 deactivation
 due
 to
 coke
 formation
 and
 com-
petitive
 C
 C
 bond
 cracking,
 which
 causes
 loss
 of
 propylene
 yield.
Hence,
 a
 periodic
 catalyst
 regeneration
 step
 is
 important
 in
 the
above-mentioned
 industrial
 operations
 [19].
 Many
 efforts
 have
been
 made
 in
 improving
 the
 catalytic
 performance,
 including
 the
addition
 of
 a
 second
 metal
 such
 as
 Sn,
 In,
 or
 Ga
 into
 Pt-based
catalysts
 [20–30],
 or
 the
 modiﬁcation
 of
 Cr-catalysts
 with
 alkali

additives
 [31–34].
 Meanwhile,
 other
 parallel
 investigations
 were
devoted
 to
 systems
 involving
 MoOx [35],
 VOx [36,37],
 and
 Zn2+ [38].
However,
 improved
 PDH
 catalysts
 are
 continuously
 sought.
Recently,
 PDH
 catalysts
 involving
 group
 IIIA
 metal
 oxides
 have
attracted
 attention.
 It
 has
 been
 reported
 that
 supported
 Ga2O3
and
 bulk
 Ga2O3 show
 promising
 catalytic
 performance
 for
 propane
dehydrogenation
 [39–41]. However,
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 active
 site
 in
Ga2O3 is
 still
 unclear,
 in
 part
 because
 of
 its
 structural
 complex-
ity
 and
 the
 co-existence
 of
 several
 polymorphs
 of
 Ga2O3 in
 mixed
oxide
 materials.
 Also,
 the
 reducibility
 of
 Ga2O3 strongly
 depends
on
 its
 interaction
 with
 the
 support
 material
 as
 well
 as
 the
 potential
presence
 of
 metals
 such
 as
 Pt
 [42]
 and
 Pd
 [43].
 A
 proposed
 reaction
mechanism
 involves
 heterolytic
 dissociation,
 in
 which
 H−adsorbs
on
 a
 Ga+ site
 (gallium
 hydride)
 and
 a
 C3H7+ carbocation
 bonds
 with
a
 neighboring
 O
 atom
 to
 form
 a
 gallium
 alkoxide
 [44].
 Supported
In2O3 as
 a
 catalyst
 in
 presence
 of
 weak
 oxidative
 gases
 (i.e.,
 CO2,
N2O)
 was
 also
 investigated,
 and
 was
 found
 to
 be
 of
 interest
 as
 a
potential
 new
 PDH
 catalyst
 [45–48].
 The
 authors
 proposed
 that
reduced
 metallic
 indium
 at
 the
 catalyst
 surface
 was
 the
 active
 site
due
 to
 observation
 of
 an
 induction
 period.
However,
 to
 the
 best
 of
 our
 knowledge,
 there
 are
 no
 reports
investigating
 binary
 In2O3–Ga2O3 mixed
 oxide
 catalysts
 for
 PDH.
Since
 each
 single
 oxide
 component
 exhibited
 some
 activity,
 we
hypothesized
 that
 the
 mixed
 In–Ga
 oxide
 catalysts
 could
 show
interesting
 PDH
 properties
 different
 from
 the
 two
 individual
 oxide
catalysts.
 To
 this
 end,
 in
 this
 work
 we
 have
 prepared
 a
 series
of
 mixed
 In–Ga
 oxides
 and
 evaluated
 them
 in
 detail
 for
 the
catalytic
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane.
 The
 structural
 properties
of
 these
 mixed-oxide
 catalysts
 were
 also
 elucidated
 via
 charac-
terization
 by
 a
 range
 of
 techniques
 including
 X-ray
 diffraction
(XRD),
 X-ray
 photoelectron
 spectroscopy
 (XPS),
 X-ray
 absorption
spectroscopy
 (XAS),
 N2-physisorption,
 temperature-programmed
desorption
 (TPD)
 of
 NH3,
 temperature-programmed
 reduction
(TPR)
 with
 H2,
 and
 elemental
 analysis
 by
 inductively
 coupled
plasma-optical
 emission
 spectroscopy
 (ICP-OES).
 The
 deposited
carbonaceous
 species
 were
 examined
 by
 thermogravimetric
 anal-
ysis
 (TGA)
 and
 Raman
 spectroscopy.
 The
 resulting
 mixed-metal
oxides
 exhibit
 a
 considerably
 higher
 activity
 in
 terms
 of
 propane
conversion
 than
 previously
 reported
 mixed
 In2O3–Al2O3,
 as
 well
as
 compared
 to
 -Ga2O3,
 on
 both
 a
 catalyst
 mass
 basis
 and
 surface
area
 basis.
 The
 origin
 of
 this
 behavior
 is
 discussed.

 Experimental
2.1.
 Catalyst
 preparation
A
 series
 of
 binary
 In2O3–Ga2O3 mixed
 oxides
 was
 synthesized
by
 an
 alcoholic
 co-precipitation
 method
 [49].
 In
 a
 typical
 syn-
thesis,
 speciﬁc
 amounts
 of
 the
 indium
 and
 gallium
 precursors
(nitrate
 hydrate,
 Sigma–Aldrich,
 99.9%)
 at
 different
 molar
 ratios
were
 dissolved
 in
 ethanol
 (Alfa-Aesar,
 95%).
 Then,
 a
 mixture
 con-
taining
 concentrated
 aqueous
 ammonia
 (Sigma–Aldrich,
 28
 wt%)
and
 ethanol
 (1:1
 in
 volume)
 was
 added
 dropwise
 to
 the
 precursor
solution
 until
 no
 further
 precipitation
 occurred
 (pH
 ≈
 8.5).
 After
aging
 for
 1
 h
 while
 stirring
 at
 250
 rpm
 at
 room
 temperature,
 the
mixture
 was
 centrifuged
 for
 30
 min
 at
 6000
 rpm.
 Then
 the
 recov-
ered,
 precipitated
 gel
 was
 dried
 at
 70 ◦C
 overnight.
 Finally,
 the
obtained
 sample
 was
 calcined
 in
 air
 at
 600 ◦C
 for
 6
 h.
 The
 result-
ing
 In–Ga
 binary
 oxides
 are
 labeled
 as
 IGx-y,
 where
 x
 and
 y
 denote
the
 molar
 ratio
 of
 In2O3/Ga2O3 in
 the
 catalyst
 (e.g.,
 IG10-90
 denotes
a
 material
 with
 In
 and
 Ga
 in
 a
 10:90
 ratio).
2.2.
 Catalyst
 characterization
N2 adsorption–desorption
 isotherms
 were
 measured
 with
 a
Tristar
 II
 3020
 apparatus
 from
 Micromeritics.
 The
 samples
 were
degassed
 and
 preheated
 at
 110 ◦C
 under
 vacuum
 on
 a
 Schlenk
 line
for
 12
 h
 before
 the
 measurements.
 The
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 (by
 the
BET
 method),
 pore
 volume
 (by
 T-plot
 method),
 and
 the
 average
 pore
size
 (by
 the
 BJH
 method)
 were
 obtained
 with
 the
 software
 of
 the
apparatus.
Elemental
 analysis
 for
 indium
 and
 gallium
 within
 the
 catalysts
was
 performed
 using
 inductively
 coupled
 plasma-optical
 emission
spectroscopy
 (ICP-OES)
 by
 ALS
 Global.
X-ray
 diffraction
 (XRD)
 measurements
 were
 performed
 on
 a
PANalytical
 X’pert
 Pro
 X-ray
 diffractometer
 operating
 with
 Ni-
ﬁltered
 Cu
 K
 radiation
 (0.154187
 nm),
 with
 generator
 settings
 of
45
 kV,
 40
 mA,
 a
 scanning
 step
 size
 of
 0.008◦,
 and
 scanning
 regions
of
 6–80◦2.
The
 reducibility
 of
 catalysts
 was
 assessed
 with
 H2 temperature-
programmed
 reduction
 (H2-TPR)
 in
 a
 ﬂow-type
 ﬁxed
 bed
 reactor
using
 an
 Autochem
 II
 Chemisorption
 Analyzer
 from
 Micromerit-
ics.
 A
 mixture
 of
 10
 vol%
 H2/Ar
 was
 used
 as
 the
 reducing
 gas
with
 a
 total
 ﬂow
 rate
 of
 30
 sccm.
 About
 100
 mg
 sample
 was
heated
 from
 room
 temperature
 to
 900 ◦C
 at
 a
 heating
 rate
of
 5 ◦C/min
 after
 being
 pretreated
 at
 150 ◦C
 for
 1
 h
 in
 Ar
 gas
ﬂow
 (50
 sccm).
 The
 reducing
 gas
 was
 cooled
 by
 a
 cold
 trap
ﬁlled
 with
 a
 mixture
 of
 acetone
 and
 liquid
 nitrogen
 to
 remove
the
 water
 generated
 from
 reduction
 of
 catalyst.
 The
 reduc-
tion
 signal
 was
 recorded
 by
 a
 thermal
 conductivity
 detector
(TCD).
The
 surface
 acidity
 was
 assessed
 by
 temperature-programmed
desorption
 of
 NH3 (NH3-TPD)
 at
 ambient
 pressure
 with
 the
above-mentioned
 equipment.
 About
 100
 mg  sample
 was
 pre-
heated
 to
 500 ◦C
 with
 a
 ramp
 of
 10 ◦C/min
 and
 maintained
 for
1
 h,
 followed
 by
 cooling
 to
 120 ◦C
 under
 He
 ﬂow
 (25
 sccm).
Then
 sufﬁcient
 NH3 (5
 vol%
 in
 He,
 30
 sccm,
 2
 h)
 was
 injected
until
 a
 saturated
 sample
 was
 obtained,
 followed
 by
 purging
with
 He
 (25
 sccm)
 for
 1
 h.
 After
 obtaining
 a
 stable
 baseline,
 the
sample
 was
 heated
 to
 700 ◦C
 at
 a
 rate
 of
 10 ◦C/min.
 The
 des-
orbed
 NH3 was
 detected
 by
 a
 thermal
 conductivity
 detector
(TCD).
Raman
 spectroscopy
 was
 performed
 using
 a
 Thermo
 Nico-
let
 Almega
 XR
 Dispersive
 Raman
 Spectrometer,
 equipped
 with
confocal
 optics
 before
 the
 spectrometer
 entrance,
 and
 a
 CCD
 detec-
tor.
 A
 microscope
 was
 used
 to
 focus
 the
 excitation
 laser
 beam
(488
 nm)
 with
 a
 laser
 power
 of
 ∼15
 mW
 on
 the
 sample
 and
to
 collect
 the
 Raman
 signal
 in
 the
 backscattered
 direction.
 The
acquisition
 time
 was
 30
 s
 and
 30
 spectra
 were
 recorded
 for
 each
sample.
 Moreover,
 each
 sample
 was
 analyzed
 by
 collecting
 data
at
 3–5
 points
 to
 eliminate
 the
 effects
 of
 the
 heterogeneity
 of
 the
sample.
Thermogravimetric
 analysis
 (TGA)
 was
 carried
 out
 by
 using
 Net-
zsch
 STA
 409
 TGA-DSC.
 About
 30
 mg  sample
 was
 loaded
 in
 a
 pan.
Then
 it
 was
 heated
 from
 20 ◦C
 to
 900 ◦C
 in
 air
 with
 ﬂow
 rate
 of
90
 mL/min.
XPS
 analysis
 was
 carried
 out
 using
 Thermo
 K-Alpha
 spectrom-
eter
 employing
 a
 monochromatic
 Al
 K
 X-ray
 source.
 Pressures
near
 5
 ×
 10−8 Torr
 were
 observed
 in
 the
 analytical

 dur-
ing
 surface
 analysis.
 The
 binding

 (BE)
 of
 all
 elements
 were
referenced
 to
 the
 C
 1s
 peak
 of
 contaminant
 carbon
 at
 284.6
 eV
 with
an
 uncertainty
 of
 ±0.2
 eV.
XAS
 measurements
 were
 carried
 out
 at
 the
 beamline
 of
 the
materials
 research
 collaborative
 access
 team
 (MRCAT,
 10BM-A,B)
at
 the
 Advanced

Samples
 were
 measured
 in
 transmission

bers
 with
 2%
 N2 in
 Ar.
 Data
 were
 collected
 with
 a

 reaction
 was
 performed
 in
 a
 U-shape
 ﬁxed
 bed
 quartz
reactor
 (ca.
 3.5
 mm
 i.d.,
 80
 cm
 long)
 with
 a
 measured
 amount
 of
catalyst
 (pellet
 size
 150–212

 atmospheric
 pressure
 at
600 ◦C.
 The
 sieved

 was
 held
 in
 the
 reactor
 by
 quartz

The
 reactor
 was
 then
 heated
 to
 600 ◦C
 in
 an

(Techne

 under

 N2 ﬂow.
 The
 reactant
 ﬂow
 contained
C3H8 with

 N2.
 The

 as
 well
 as

were
 analyzed
 on

 In
 contrast,
 the
 broad
 diffraction
 lines
 of
 the
 as-
synthesized
 Ga2O3 indicate
 a
 mostly
 amorphous
 structure.
 The
peaks
 at
 31.9◦,

 assigned
 as

 in
 the
 -polymorphs

 may
 also

 [52].

Table
 1
 summarizes
 the
 textural
 properties
 (BET
 surface
 area,
pore
 volume
 and
 average
 pore
 size)
 of
 the
 IG
 catalysts.
 The
physisorption
 isotherms
 are
 shown
 in
 the
 supporting
 information
(Fig.
 S2).
 The
 bulk
 In2O3 has
 the
 largest
 pore
 size
 but
 lowest
 sur-
face
 area,
 while
 the
 bulk
 Ga2O3 exhibits
 the
 opposite
 behavior,
 a
large
 surface
 area
 with
 a
 small
 pore
 size
 less
 than
 4
 nm.
 As
 the
indium-gallium
 ratio
 is
 adjusted
 within
 the
 mixed
 oxide
 samples,
the
 properties
 follow
 the
 above
 trend
 within
 the
 limits
 of
 instru-
mental
 error.
Among
 the
 surface
 properties
 of
 the
 catalysts
 that
 affect
 cat-
alytic
 performance,
 acidity
 plays
 a
 key
 role
 in
 many
 reactions
 [53].
Hence,
 the
 surface
 acidity
 of
 the
 In–Ga
 catalysts
 was
 examined
 by
NH3-TPD
 (see
 supporting
 material,
 Fig.
 S3).
 The
 results
 are
 sum-
marized
 in
 Table
 2.
 All
 the
 mixed
 metal
 oxides
 exhibit
 two
 TPD
peaks:
 one
 broad
 peak
 at
 120–450 ◦C,
 and
 a
 smaller
 peak
 between
450
 and
 600 ◦C.
 These
 two
 peaks
 correspond
 to
 acid
 sites
 with
 weak
and
 medium
 strength,
 respectively.
 It
 is
 difﬁcult
 to
 explicitly
 corre-
late
 the
 acid
 properties
 of
 binary
 oxide
 systems,
 since
 the
 resulting
acidity
 can
 be
 inﬂuenced
 by
 many
 factors
 such
 as
 the
 type
 of
 metals,
the
 synthetic
 method,
 and
 the
 relative
 population
 of
 metals
 [54].
However,
 it
 is
 widely
 accepted
 that
 the
 combination
 of
 two
 metal
oxides
 can
 usually
 generate
 more
 acidic
 sites
 than
 that
 of
 a
 single
component
 oxide
 [55–57].
 It
 can
 be
 seen
 from
 Table
 2
 that
 the
 In–Ga
samples
 contain
 more
 acid
 sites
 (normalized
 by
 the
 mass
 of
 cata-
lyst)
 than
 pure
 In2O3 and
 Ga2O3.
 Pure
 In2O3 exhibits
 the
 most
 acid
sites
 based
 on
 surface
 area,
 and
 the
 value
 monotonically
 decreases
when
 increasing
 the
 Ga2O3 percentage.
3.2.
 Redox
 properties
 characterization
The
 redox
 properties
 of
 the
 IG
 mixed
 oxides
 were
 character-
ized
 by
 H2-TPR.
 Fig.
 2
 shows
 the
 H2-TPR
 proﬁles
 of
 the
 bulk
 In2O3,
Ga2O3,
 and
 various
 In2O3–Ga2O3 mixed
 oxides.
 A
 broad
 peak
 cen-
tered
 at
 ∼710 ◦C
 is
 assigned
 to
 the
 reduction
 of
 bulk
 In2O3 to
In0 [58,59].
 The
 calculated
 H2 uptake
 is
 ∼8.9
 mmol/gcat,
 indicat-
ing
 ∼80%
 of
 the
 In2O3 species
 were
 reduced
 to
 indium
 metal
under
 these
 conditions.
 Similarly,
 the
 reduction
 extents
 for
 In–Ga
binary
 oxides
 samples
 containing
 indium
 are
 calculated
 and
 listed
in
 Table
 1.
 In
 contrast,
 no
 peaks
 are
 observed
 for
 reduction
 of
 bulk
Ga2O3,
 suggesting
 Ga2O3 could
 not
 be
 reduced
 in
 H2 in
 the
 current
temperature
 region
 [60].
 For
 the
 case
 of
 In–Ga
 mixed
 oxides,
 the
reduction
 peak
 appears
 at
 a
 lower
 temperature
 (ca.
 500–600 ◦C)

with
 much
 weaker
 intensity,
 although
 no
 peak
 was
 observed
 for
the
 IG2-98
 sample,
 possibly
 due
 to
 the
 extremely
 small
 amount
 of
indium
 in
 the
 sample.
 The
 shift
 of
 the
 reduction
 peak
 is
 generally
accepted
 for
 reduction
 of
 supported
 In2O3 with
 different
 particle
sizes.
 Smaller
 particles
 lead
 to
 lower
 reduction
 temperatures.
 Tak-
ing
 into
 account
 that
 highly
 dispersed
 In2O3 could
 be
 reduced
 in
the
 range
 of
 200–500 ◦C
 [58,59],
 the
 observed
 shift
 suggests
 the
formation
 of
 moderately
 dispersed
 In2O3 in
 the
 mixed
 oxide.
 The
appearance
 of
 a
 single
 reduction
 peak
 suggests
 that
 only
 one
 type
of
 In2O3 phase
 may
 exist
 in
 the
 IG
 samples,
 an
 observation
 that
 is
different
 from
 the
 previous
 study
 on
 In–Al
 mixed
 oxides
 [46].
3.3.
 Propane
 dehydrogenation
 reactions
Propane
 dehydrogenation
 over
 the
 In–Ga
 mixed
 oxides
 was
carried
 out
 at
 600 ◦C
 under
 1
 atmosphere
 total
 pressure.
 The
main
 products
 were
 propylene
 and
 hydrogen.
 Other
 side
 products
formed
 include
 short
 chain
 hydrocarbons,
 such
 as
 methane,
 ethane,
and
 ethylene.
 Trace
 amounts
 of
 higher
 hydrocarbons
 (i.e.,
 butane,
pentane)
 were
 also
 observed.
 Prior
 to
 the
 reaction,
 blank
 tests
 were
carried
 out
 under
 the
 same
 conditions
 (i.e.,
 temperature,
 gas
 mix-
ture
 composition,
 residence
 time,
 etc.)
 to
 investigate
 the
 extent
 of
thermal
 cracking.
 The
 results
 indicate
 that
 less
 than
 4.5%
 conversion
can
 be
 associated
 with
 thermal
 reactions
 (see
 supporting
 material,
Table
 S1).
Two
 ranges
 of
 reactivity
 were
 investigated
 in
 this
 study.
 First,
the
 reactions
 were
 run
 such
 that
 the
 initial
 propane
 conversion
 was
less
 than
 10%
 to
 assess
 the
 intrinsic
 reactivity
 of
 the
 catalysts.
 The
gas
 mixture
 composition
 was
 ﬁxed
 at
 5
 vol%
 C3H8 balanced
 with
N2,
 with
 a
 total
 ﬂow
 rate
 of
 20
 sccm,
 while
 the
 catalyst
 amount
 was
varied.
 The
 residence
 time
 was
 ca.
 4
 s.
 As
 can
 be
 seen
 in
 Fig.
 3a,
 a
deactivation
 was
 observed
 for
 the
 three
 catalysts
 during
 the
 ini-
tial
 90
 min,
 after
 which
 the
 conversion
 became
 stable.
 The
 IG2-98
catalyst
 showed
 a
 constant
 C3H6 selectivity
 ranging
 from
 30
 to
40%,
 while
 for
 the
 IG5-95
 and
 IG10-90
 catalysts,
 the
 selectivity
decreased
 to
 ca.
 20%
 after
 150
 min.
 However,
 the
 initial
 selectiv-
ity
 during
 the
 ﬁrst
 30
 min
 of
 reaction
 was
 higher
 for
 these
 catalysts
than
 for
 the
 IG2-98
 material
 (Fig.
 3b).
 Fitting
 the
 reactivity
 data
from
 the
 steady-state
 region
 and
 extrapolating
 back
 to
 time
 zero,
 an
extrapolated
 initial
 conversion
 (‘intrinsic
 activity’)
 was
 estimated
for
 each
 catalyst.
 Our
 data
 suggest
 the
 In–Ga
 mixed
 oxides
 exhibit
higher
 intrinsic
 activity
 as
 the
 indium
 percentage
 decreases
 (on
both
 catalyst
 mass
 basis
 and
 surface
 area
 basis).
 Given
 the
 observed
trend,
 it
 is
 worthwhile
 to
 examine
 whether
 bulk
 Ga2O3 would
 be
the
 most
 active
 catalyst.
 Hence,
 a
 control
 experiment
 was
 car-
ried
 out
 under
 the
 same
 conditions
 with
 -Ga2O3 (see
 supporting
material,
 Fig.
 S4).
 Interestingly,
 the
 calculated
 initial
 activity
 for
this
 material
 was
 similar
 to
 IG5-95.
 The
 initial
 reaction
 rates
 on
both
 catalyst
 mass
 basis
 and
 surface
 area
 basis
 are
 summarized
in
 Table
 3.
 The
 highest
 values
 for
 IG2-98
 are
 25.5
 mol/h/m2 and
2.1
 mol/h/gcat,
 respectively.
 To
 have
 an
 accurate
 comparison
 with
the
 literature,
 the
 instantaneous
 activities
 associated
 with
 the
 ﬁrst
data
 point
 were
 also
 calculated
 and
 are
 reported
 in
 Table
 3. For
an
 alternate
 comparison,
 the
 mass
 based
 activity
 of
 the
 reference
catalyst
 IA10-90
 was
 calculated
 by
 considering
 only
 In2O3 species
as
 active.
 While
 for
 the
 current
 IG
 series,
 both
 In2O3 and
 Ga2O3
are
 considered
 to
 provide
 activity.
 The
 results
 suggest
 the
 catalysts
of
 the
 IG
 series
 exhibit
 higher
 activity
 than
 the
 Al2O3-supported
In2O3 catalysts
 reported
 previously
 by
 a
 factor
 of
 12–28
 (surface
area
 basis)
 and
 1–3
 (active
 metal
 basis)
 at
 the
 same
 reaction
 tem-
perature
 [46],
 noting
 that
 the
 current
 WHSV
 is
 4
 times
 that
 used
in
 the
 previous
 literature
 report
 (0.54
 h−1 vs.
 0.135
 h−1).
 In
 addi-
tion,
 the
 superior
 activities
 of
 IG5-95
 and
 IG2-98
 compared
 with
-Ga2O3 suggest
 a
 synergistic
 effect
 due
 to
 incorporation
 of
 indium
into
 a
 dominant
 Ga2O3 phase.
A
 second
 series
 of
 experiments
 was
 aimed
 at
 reaching
 a
 higher
conversion
 regime
 that
 is
 more
 relevant
 to
 industrial
 operation.
For
 these
 runs,
 the
 reaction
 conditions
 were
 ﬁxed
 for
 all
 three
catalysts,
 giving
 the
 results
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 4.
 The
 residence
 time
was
 ca.
 8
 s.
 As
 before,
 a
 deactivation
 period
 was
 observed
 in
 the
initial
 90
 min
 of
 reaction,
 as
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 4a.
 Subsequently,
 a
steady
 activity
 was
 obtained
 over
 the
 In–Ga
 mixed
 oxides
 in
 the
order
 of
 IG2-98
 >
 IG5-95
 >
 IG10-90.
 The
 calculated
 intrinsic
 activi-
ties
 were
 0.9,
 0.7,
 and
 0.5
 mol/h/gcat,
 respectively.
 Regarding
 the
C3H6 selectivity
 data
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 4b,
 IG2-98
 provided
 a
 value
of
 ∼25%
 over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 reaction.
 For
 the
 case
 of
 IG5-95
and
 IG10-90,
 although
 the
 initial
 selectivity
 value
 was
 higher
 (ca.
28%)
 it
 dropped
 to
 a
 lower
 steady-state
 selectivity
 (ca.
 13%
 and
 10%,
respectively)
 with
 the
 following
 order:
 IG2-98
 >
 IG5-95
 >
 IG10-90.
The
 main
 side-products
 were
 CH4,
 C2H6 and
 C2H4.
 The

tributions
 are
 shown
 in

 observed.
 Taking
 into
 account
 the
 fact
 that
 metallic
 indium
 has
a
 melting
 point
 at
 ca.
 157 ◦C,
 at
 the
 current
 reaction
 temperature
the
 generated
 In0 could
 be
 highly
 mobile,
 leading
 to
 sintering
 of
 the

 period,
one
 may
 surmise
 the

 different
 from

 In2O3/Al2O3 system.
The

 with
 a
 decrease

 Meanwhile,
 a
 rough
 trend
 of
 C3H6 selectivity
 was
 observed:
lower
 temperature
 led
 to
 higher
 selectivity,
 as
 expected
 (although
the
 data
 in
 Fig.
 6b
 have
 relatively
 larger
 scatter
 than
 those
 in
 Fig.
 6a).
This
 observation
 can
 be
 rationalized
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 lower
 hydro-
carbon
 (C1–C2)
 byproducts
 formed
 through
 cracking
 and
 pyrolysis
processes
 become
 kinetically
 and
 thermodynamically
 unfavorable

 Thus,
 an

Ex
 situ
 XPS
 measurements
 were
 carried
 out
 to
 reveal
 the
 sur-
face
 In/Ga
 ratio
 of
 the
 catalysts.
 The
 results
 for
 the
 series
 of
 catalysts
before
 and
 after
 reaction
 are
 summarized
 in
 Table
 4.
 It
 can
 be
 seen
that
 the
 In/Ga
 ratio
 at
 the
 surface
 increased
 after
 the
 reaction.
 This
may
 be
 due
 to
 the
 migration
 and
 agglomeration
 of
 indium
 from
 the
bulk
 phase
 to
 the
 surface
 during
 the
 reaction.
 In
 addition,
 consid-
ering
 the
 redox
 properties
 of
 indium
 oxide,
 the
 dispersed
 In2O3
species
 at
 the
 surface
 can
 be
 simultaneously
 reduced
 by
 the
 formed
H2 during
 the
 dehydrogenation,
 which
 leads
 to
 removal
 of
 surface
oxygen
 and
 consequently
 causes
 an
 increase
 of
 the
 indium
 mass
percentage
 at
 the
 surface.
Indium
 K-edge
 XANES
 was
 used
 to
 evaluate
 the
 electronic
 state
of
 the
 In–Ga
 catalysts
 before
 and
 after
 reaction,
 and
 the
 ﬁtting
results
 are
 summarized
 in
 Table
 4
 as
 well.
 The
 raw
 XANES
 data
 and
ﬁtting
 curves
 are
 available
 in
 the
 supporting
 information
 as
 Figs.
 S5
and
 S6.
 From
 the
 data,
 it
 is
 clear
 that
 no
 metallic
 indium
 exists
 in
 the
as-synthesized
 In–Ga
 catalysts.
 However,
 after
 dehydrogenation,
all
 the
 In–Ga
 catalysts
 contain
 metallic
 indium
 to
 varying
 extents,
suggesting
 that
 indium
 oxide
 domains
 are
 easily
 reduced
 under
 the
reaction
 conditions
 employed.
 There
 is
 no
 obvious
 trend
 that
 cor-
relates
 the
 In0/In3+ ratio
 with
 the
 overall
 In–Ga
 composition.
 This
is
 possibly
 due
 to
 the
 complexity
 of
 the
 binary
 metal
 oxide
 system
(i.e.,
 how
 the
 guest
 indium
 oxide
 disperses
 in
 the
 primary
 Ga2O3,
the
 domain
 size
 of
 indium
 oxide,
 etc.).
 It
 should
 be
 mentioned
 that
metallic
 indium
 is
 quite
 stable
 to
 oxidation
 at
 room
 temperature
and
 could
 hardly
 be
 oxidized
 to
 In2O3 under
 an
 ambient
 air
 envi-
ronment,
 though
 it
 has
 been
 reported
 to
 form
 a
 ∼4
 nm
 oxide
 layer
after
 heating
 at
 130 ◦C
 in
 air
 for
 120
 min
 [62]. In
 addition,
 although
metallic
 indium
 can
 exhibit
 intermediate
 oxidation
 states
 at
 high
temperature,
 in
 the
 current
 study,
 it
 is
 unlikely
 to
 occur
 as
 a
 sta-
ble
 species,
 since
 preparation
 of
 In2O
 from
 In2O3 was
 reported
 to
require
 heating
 at
 700 ◦C
 under
 vacuum
 conditions,
 while
 InO
 was
only
 detected
 in
 the
 vapor
 phase
 [63].
In
 parallel
 with
 the
 XANES
 investigation,
 ex
 situ
 XRD
 measure-
ments
 were
 carried
 out
 to
 examine
 any
 changes
 in
 crystallinity
 of
the
 In–Ga
 catalysts
 after
 the
 reaction,
 with
 the
 results
 summarized
in
 Fig.
 7.
 For
 the
 IG10-90
 and
 IG5-95
 samples,
 characteristic
 peaks
assigned
 to
 In2O3 (JCPDS
 6-0416)
 appeared
 after
 the
 dehydrogena-
tion
 reaction,
 consistent
 with
 indium
 sintering
 during
 reaction.
Moreover,
 it
 is
 noteworthy
 that
 some
 diffraction
 peaks
 associated
with
 metallic
 indium
 (JCPDS
 85-1409)
 also
 appear
 [64].
 This
 is
 due
to
 the
 partial
 reduction
 upon
 exposure
 to
 reducing
 reaction
 con-
ditions
 (600 ◦C
 with
 H2 and
 hydrocarbons).
 Such
 a
 conclusion
 is
also
 supported
 by
 the
 H2-TPR
 experiments.
 Along
 with
 the
 XPS
and
 XANES
 results,
 this
 provides
 evidence
 for
 the
 formation
 of
 In0
during
 the
 reaction.
 No
 obvious
 change
 is
 observed
 for
 the
 IG2-98
sample
 in
 the
 XRD
 pattern,
 likely
 due
 to
 the
 low
 indium
 loading,
although
 the
 XANES
 spectra
 support
 the
 formation
 of
 some
 In0
domains
 in
 this
 material
 as
 well.
To
 gain
 insights
 into
 the
 stability
 and
 recyclability
 of
 the
 In–Ga
catalysts,
 a
 re-oxidation
 step
 at
 600 ◦C
 was
 added
 and
 IG10-90
was
 investigated
 over
 the
 course
 of
 two
 re-oxidation
 cycles
 after
an
 initial
 period
 of
 activity.
 From
 Fig.
 8,
 it
 is
 clear
 that
 after
 the
re-oxidation
 step,
 the
 activity
 modestly
 increased
 during
 the

 However,
 overall,
 the
 activity
 and
 selectivity
 of
 the
 cata-
lyst
 remained
 mostly
 unchanged,
 even
 after
 re-oxidation.
 An
 XRD
measurement
 for
 IG10-90
 catalyst
 after
 the
 re-oxidation
 step
 was
also
 carried
 out
 and
 is
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 7,
 where
 it
 can
 be
 observed
that
 after
 exposing
 to
 air
 at
 the
 reaction
 temperature
 for
 1
 h,
 the
main
 peak
 for
 the
 (1
 0
 1)
 plane
 of
 In0 slightly
 decreases
 in
 intensity,
suggesting
 the
 In0 domains
 could
 be
 partly
 re-oxidized.
 Aside
 from
this,
 the
 overall
 pattern
 is
 almost
 identical
 to
 that
 of
 the
 sample
before
 re-oxidation.
 This
 observation
 suggests
 that
 during
 the
 reac-
tion,
 the
 agglomeration
 of
 well-dispersed
 In2O3 to
 larger
 domains
occurs
 and
 may
 be
 responsible
 for
 the
 loss
 of
 activity.
 Such
 a
 pro-
cess,
 at
 least
 under
 the
 current
 re-oxidation
 treatment,
 is
 believed
to
 not
 be
 completely
 reversible.
H2 pretreatment
 was
 also
 applied
 to
 an
 example
 of
 IG10-90
 prior
to
 the
 reaction
 at
 600 ◦C,
 with
 the
 results
 shown
 in

 It
 can
 be
seen
 that
 the
 initial
 conversion
 was
 ∼16%,
 and
 dropped
 to
 a
 steady
conversion
 of
 ∼12.5%
 after
 70
 min.
 After
 a

 H2-regeneration,
the
 IG10-90
 catalyst
 regained
 its
 original
 activity
 and
 decreased
to
 the
 steady
 state

 within

 min.

should
 be
 noted
 that
 for
 this
 IG
 catalyst
 after
 the
 H2-treatment,
 the
C3H6 selectivity
 was
 poorer
 than
 in
 the
 case
 of
 the
 O2-treatment.
 A
H2-pretreatment
 (reducing
 some
 In2O3 to
 In0)
 could
 signiﬁcantly
change
 the
 surface
 properties
 (acidity,
 surface
 area)
 of
 the
 solid.
Therefore,
 an
 H2-TPR
 followed
 by
 NH3-TPD
 over
 bulk
 In2O3 was
investigated.
 After
 reduction
 by
 H2,
 the
 produced
 In0 showed
 a
weak
 NH3 desorption
 signal,
 indicating
 the
 sample
 lost
 most
 of
the
 surface
 acidity
 (see
 supporting
 material,
 Fig.
 S7).
 Our
 ﬁndings
indicate
 that
 reduced
 In0 under
 reaction
 conditions
 may
 melt
 and
migrate/agglomerate
 as
 a
 non-porous
 material,
 causing
 a
 dramatic
loss
 of
 surface
 area
 and
 acidity,
 which
 is
 proposed
 to
 contribute
 to
the
 loss
 of
 activity.
 In
 addition,
 the
 increase
 of
 In2O3 domain
 size
(from
 ex
 situ
 XRD)
 might
 be
 another
 reason
 for
 loss
 of
 catalytic
performance.

 Coke
 analysis
As
 the
 main
 issue
 associated
 with
 deactivation
 in
 the
 PDH
 pro-
cess
 is
 coke
 formation,
 Raman
 spectroscopy
 was
 used
 to
 examine
the
 deposited
 carbonaceous
 species
 at
 the
 catalyst
 surface.
 The
spectra
 were
 deconvoluted
 into
 a
 combination
 of
 4
 bands.
 The
individual
 peak
 parameters
 (position,
 intensity,
 FWHM)
 were
 set
based
 on
 visual
 inspection.
 Then
 the
 residuals
 between
 the
 raw
data
 and
 overall
 ﬁt
 were
 minimized
 in
 a
 least
 squares
 regression.
The
 G
 band
 was
 ﬁtted
 by
 a
 Lorentzian
 function,
 while
 a
 Gaussian
function
 was
 used
 to
 ﬁt
 other
 bands.
 Fig.
 10
 shows
 the
 stack
 of
obtained
 Raman
 spectra
 as
 well
 as
 the
 ﬁtted
 results
 for
 the
 spent
IG
 catalysts
 that
 were
 used
 for
 the
 experiments
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 3.
As
 can
 be
 seen,
 four
 distinguishable
 bands
 appear
 in
 the
 region
of
 1000–1800
 cm−1.
 The
 most
 intensive
 band
 at
 ca.
 1590
 cm−1 is
assigned
 as
 the
 G
 band,
 which
 is
 due
 to
 a
 highly
 crystalline
 car-
bonaceous
 material
 (i.e.,
 a
 graphitic
 lattice)
 [65].
 The
 second
 most
intense
 band
 at
 ∼1360
 cm−1 is
 the
 D1 band
 due
 to
 in-plane
 defects
and
 heteroatoms
 in
 the
 carbon
 lattice.
 In
 addition,
 the
 D3 band
 at
1500
 cm−1 and
 the
 D4 band
 at
 1220
 cm−1 are
 assigned
 as
 amor-
phous
 carbon
 (out-plane
 defect)
 and
 a
 disordered
 graphitic
 lattice,
respectively
 [66].
 A
 previous
 study
 tried
 to
 correlate
 the
 G
 band
position
 to
 the
 graphite
 particle
 size,
 (1575
 cm−1 for
 larger
 and
perfect
 graphite
 crystals,
 while
 a
 blue
 shift
 to
 1590
 cm−1 indicated
a
 decrease
 of
 the
 crystallite
 size)
 [67].
 For
 the
 catalysts
 studied
here,

is
 not
 observed.
 However,
 the
 G
 band
 positions
 for
 the
 IG
 sam-
ples
 are
 all
 around
 1590
 cm−1,
 suggesting
 small
 graphite
 crystals
amongst
 the
 deposited
 coke.
 An
 important
 parameter
 to
 describe
degree
 of
 organization
 of
 the
 carbonaceous
 materials
 is
 the
 inten-
sity
 ratio
 of
 the
 D1/G
 bands
 (R1 ratio).
 These
 values
 are
 listed
 in
Table
 S2,
 where
 it
 can
 be
 seen
 that
 a
 decrease
 in
 the
 In/Ga
 ratio
corresponds
 to
 the
 D1/G
 ratio
 dropping
 from
 0.88
 to
 0.70.
 This
indicates
 that
 a
 catalyst
 with
 a
 lower
 indium
 percentage
 tends
to
 produce
 coke
 with
 a
 more
 ordered
 and
 graphitic
 nature.
 This
might
 suggest
 a
 correlation
 between
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 coke
 formed
and
 the
 steady
 state
 value
 of
 the
 C3H6 selectivity:
 coke
 with
 more
graphitic
 nature
 is
 correlated
 with
 catalysts
 that
 yield
 a
 higher
C3H6 selectivity,
 perhaps
 by
 suppressing
 side
 reactions
 that
 lead
to
 low
 molecular
 weight
 (cracking)
 products.
 This
 would
 be
 con-
sistent
 with
 Weckhuysen’s
 previous
 study
 over
 Pt-based
 catalysts
[66].
It
 should
 be
 mentioned
 that
 the
 accurate
 quantitative
 analysis
of
 coke
 in
 the
 catalysts
 by
 TGA
 is
 difﬁcult
 in
 the
 current
 In–Ga–O
system
 because
 the
 indium
 species
 reduced
 under
 reaction
 condi-
tions
 are
 reoxidized
 during
 TGA
 experiments
 aimed
 at
 assessing
the
 coke
 content
 on
 the
 catalysts.
 In
 this
 study,
 two
 methods
 were
applied
 to
 estimate
 the
 total
 amount
 of
 formed
 coke:
 (i)
 direct
TGA
 measurements
 with
 simplifying
 assumptions
 to
 deconvolute
indium
 oxidation
 vs.
 carbon
 combustion,
 and
 (ii)
 examination
 of
the
 carbon
 percentage
 of
 the
 remaining
 spent
 catalyst
 by
 ele-
mental
 analysis.
 The
 TGA
 results
 are
 shown
 in
 the
 supporting
information
 (Fig.
 S8).
 It
 should
 be
 noted
 that
 the
 mass
 loss
 dur-
ing
 the
 350–600 ◦C
 ramp
 range
 is
 the
 overall
 effect
 of
 mass
 loss
due
 to
 the
 coke
 decomposition
 and
 mass
 gain
 due
 to
 oxidation
of
 metallic
 indium
 produced
 under
 PDH
 conditions.
 In
 this
 way,
the
 coke
 percentage
 was
 estimated
 by
 subtracting
 the
 indium
 re-
oxidation
 (assuming
 all
 In0 atoms
 are
 oxidized.
 The
 indium
 content
in
 each
 sample
 was
 measured
 by
 elemental
 analysis).
 The
 calcu-
lated
 deposited
 coke
 percentage
 as
 well
 as
 the
 carbon
 balance
from
 both
 methods
 are
 summarized
 in
 Table
 5.
 It
 can
 be
 seen
that
 the
 general
 trend
 suggests
 that
 higher
 gallium
 content
 leads
to
 more
 coke
 formation.
 In
 general,
 calibrated
 results
 based
 on
these
 methods
 show
 good
 consistency,
 although
 method
 1
 pro-
vides
 a
 little
 higher
 coke
 estimate
 than
 method
 2.
 The
 carbon
balance
 after
 calibration
 using
 these
 methods
 is
 generally
 higher
than
 90%.

 Conclusions
In
 this
 work
 we  have
 explored
 In2O3–Ga2O3 mixed-oxide
 cat-
alysts
 for
 non-oxidative
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 reactions.
 This
family
 of
 catalysts
 is
 shown
 to
 exhibit
 high
 intrinsic
 activity
 in
 terms
of
 C3H8 conversion.
 Among
 the
 In–Ga
 catalysts,
 we  report
 that
IG2-98
 provides
 maximum
 activity
 of
 58.6
 mol/h/m2 (28-fold)
and
 4.9
 mol/h/gcat (3-fold)
 higher
 than
 the
 previously
 studied
In2O3/Al2O3 catalysts
 even
 at
 a
 4
 times
 higher
 WHSV,
 although
 the
steady
 value
 of
 C3H8 selectivity
 is
 less
 than
 half
 of
 that
 observed
in
 In2O3/Al2O3 (ca.
 35%
 vs.
 85%).
 For
 the
 best
 catalyst
 operat-
ing
 at
 higher
 conversions,
 a
 stable
 conversion
 of
 ca.
 25%,
 was
achieved
 with
 a
 modest
 ca.
 25%
 C3H6 selectivity.
 As
 expected,
a
 lower
 reaction
 temperature
 helps
 to
 suppress
 side
 reactions
(cracking)
 to
 enhance
 C3H6 selectivity,
 while
 suppressing
 over-
all
 productivity.
 H2-TPR
 measurements
 suggest
 the
 incorporation
of
 In–O–Ga
 linkages
 improves
 the
 dispersion
 and
 reducibility
 of
In2O3 domains.
 NH3-TPR
 experiments
 demonstrate
 a
 generation
of
 acidic
 sites
 in
 the
 mixed
 oxides
 compared
 to
 the
 single
 compo-
nent
 oxides.
 Raman
 analysis
 indicates
 that
 catalysts
 with
 deposited
coke
 with
 more
 disordered
 structures
 have
 lower
 C3H6 selectiv-
ity,
 while
 catalysts
 with
 graphite-like
 coke
 better
 suppress
 side
reactions
 and
 maintain
 higher
 level
 of
 C3H6 selectivity.
 Ex
 situ
XPS,
 XRD,
 and
 XANES
 analysis
 illustrates
 the
 agglomeration
 of
 dis-
persed
 In2O3 domains
 and
 production
 of
 In0 are
 responsible,
 at
least
 in
 part,
 for
 the
 loss
 of
 activity
 during
 use.
 These
 processes
are
 not
 completely
 reversible
 under
 O2/H2 regeneration
 treat-
ments.
The
 present
 study
 indicates
 that
 the
 In/Ga
 binary
 oxide
 system
has
 potential
 as
 a
 new
 catalyst
 for
 the
 propane
 dehydrogenation
reaction.
 However,
 due
 to
 the
 low/moderate
 propene
 selectivity
and
 catalyst
 deactivation,
 substantial
 improvements
 in
 catalyst
preparation
 would
 have
 to
 be
 achieved
 to
 reach
 a
 performance
comparable
 to
 commercial
 Cr-based
 and
 Pt-based
 catalysts
 for
 this
reaction.
