Abstract
With regard to establishing the effect of the nature of Zn species loaded in a zeolite on the aromatization of propane, the transformation of 13C-labeled propane (propane-1-13C and propane-2-13C) has been monitored by 1H and 13C (CP) MAS NMR at 296–623 K for two zeolite samples, containing exclusively either isolated Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite sample) or small (ZnO)n clusters of zinc oxide (ZnO/H-BEA zeolite sample). It has been established that similar intermediates, π-complex of propene and σ-allylzinc species, are formed at propane transformation to aromatics on both zeolite samples. However, the formation of the identified intermediates and their evolution to final aromatic products have been detected to occur on Zn2+/H-BEA at lower temperature (by 100 K) as compared to the same transformation on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite. Analysis of the kinetics of propane transformation by 1H MAS NMR in situ has shown similar regularities for propane aromatization and hydrogenolysis on the different zeolite samples, but the reactions on Zn2+/H-BEA occur 10 times faster than on ZnO/H-BEA. This allows us to conclude on a higher efficiency of Zn2+ cations compared to ZnO species for propane aromatization on Zn-modified zeolites.

1. Introduction
Light C1–C4 alkanes, found as natural gas constituents or produced as the downstream industry products, are abundant and cheap feedstock. Chemical utilization of the alkanes requires specific catalysts and new processing technologies. However, there are a number of fundamental and applied issues that have to be addressed before the active and selective catalysts are developed. Each of the alkanes meets distinct challenges with respect to chemical activation and further conversion. For example, the direct one-step conversion of methane is difficult to realize since it is the most inert alkane among saturated hydrocarbons; therefore, either high temperatures (1) or indirect routes (2) for its conversion are required. On the other hand, propane, being more easily converted on zeolite catalysts, can yield not only valuable products, such as propene or a mixture of simple aromatic hydrocarbons, (3−5) but also undesired byproducts of the alkane hydrogenolysis, such as methane and ethane. (6−8) Hence, the corresponding studies are needed for further advances in the development of the effective catalysts for light alkanes transformations.
Zn-containing zeolites, ZSM-5 or BEA, show their potential for propane transformation to aromatic hydrocarbons. (4,9−11) It is established that, in dependence of the preparation method, zinc species can be found in the form of isolated Zn2+ cations, (9,12−16) bridged (Zn–O–Zn)2+ fragments, (14,17) small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores, (9,15,18) and large ZnO particles located on the outer surface of zeolite crystals. (9,18) Considering this variety, the exact roles of different zinc species and Brønsted acid sites (BAS) in propane aromatization have to be clarified for further improvement of Zn-modified zeolite properties with regard to dehydrogenation and aromatization efficiency. In particular, it is of immense importance to study the peculiarities of propane interaction with different Zn sites for the alkane activation to understand how the nature of the Zn sites (e.g., Zn2+ cations or ZnO species) affects the overall performance of the catalyst for aromatization reaction.
The efficiency of different Zn species for propane aromatization can be addressed by the analysis of the reaction occurrence with spectroscopic methods. High-resolution solid-state 1H NMR (1H MAS NMR) can be used to monitor in situ the peculiarities of the reaction kinetics (19−25) for the zeolite samples modified exclusively by one type of the zinc species, e.g., either Zn2+ cations or small ZnO clusters. (15) This allows to reveal the similarities or differences of the kinetics, their parameters, such as rate constants and activation energies, the reaction routes, and the main products in dependence of the particular Zn species present in the zeolite. 13C (CP) MAS NMR provides complementary data for the nature of the surface intermediates formed from propane during its conversion. (8,26−33) Hence, the peculiarities of the mechanism of propane transformation with the assistance of different Zn sites can be established.
To address the efficiency of propane aromatization on Zn-modified zeolites with the assistance of Zn species of different nature, in this work two samples of H-BEA zeolite, containing either Zn2+ cations or small ZnO clusters, were tested for the aromatization reaction. In particular, the kinetics of propane transformation on these different zeolite samples was monitored with 1H MAS NMR in situ in the temperature range 543–573 K. The kinetics parameters were determined for the main pathways of propane transformation, aromatization, and hydrogenolysis. Also, the 13C CP/MAS NMR method was used to follow the peculiarities of propane transformation in dependence of the nature of Zn species loaded in the zeolite. The use of propane with the selective 13C-labels, in either methyl or methylene groups, helped us to identify major surface intermediates of the reaction. Thus, the successive steps of propane transformation were determined, and the efficiency of Zn2+ cations and ZnO species for propane aromatization was clarified. Importantly, the kinetics analysis provided an evidence for the co-conversion of methane with propane on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite at temperatures as low as 563 K to yield ethane. This could be of potential interest for developing the process for the production of valuable chemicals from methane under relatively mild conditions.
2. Experimental Section
Samples Preparation
The zeolite beta in the sodium form Na-BEA (Si/Al = 23) (34,35) was used as a starting material. Two different procedures were employed to load zinc into the zeolite pore system in the form of either Zn2+ cations or subnanometric ZnO clusters. To prepare the Zn2+-exchanged form, the parent Na-BEA was transformed into acidic form (by the treatment with NH4NO3 solution and calcination at 823 K) followed by evacuation and reaction with zinc vapor at 773 K. (15,16,36−38) All the procedures were performed in a sealed glass tube to exclude influence of atmospheric moisture and air. The procedure leads to about 40% exchange of bridged Si–O(H)–Al groups for Zn2+ cations in BEA zeolite (Table S1). This sample is designated as Zn2+/H-BEA. To prepare the sample with ZnO clusters inside zeolitic pores, the Na-BEA zeolite was transformed to Li form by the ion exchange with LiNO3 solution, and the external surface was neutralized with trimethylsilyl chloride (10 wt % toluene solution). Under vacuum conditions, the Li-BEA zeolite was exposed to dimethylzinc vapor followed by the hydrolysis of the zinc–organic species inside zeolitic pores with water vapor at ambient temperature. Finally, lithium cations were substituted by the ion exchange for ammonium, and the sample was calcined at 823 K to create Brønsted acid sites and to remove all the organic species from the inner and external surface of the zeolite. (15) According to chemical analysis, the zinc content in the resultant sample, which is designated as ZnO/H-BEA, was 0.94 wt %. The synthesized ZnO/H-BEA sample was activated under vacuum at 673 K before use. More details on the preparation procedure and characterization of the synthesized samples with various techniques can be found in refs (15and39). There it was shown that Zn species of the ZnO/H-BEA sample represented the small ZnnOn (n = 2–5) clusters, located inside the internal void of the zeolite pores, and the quantity of BAS was identical to that of parent H-BEA (Table S1). (15,39) Both samples, Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA, have similar zinc contents. These samples were used for comparative analysis of the products composition, formed from propane and for comparison of the conversion rates.
Reagents Used
Propane with the selective 13C-labels (99% isotope enrichment), propane-1-13C and propane-2-13C, and unlabeled propane, C3H8 (purity 99.97%), were purchased form Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc. Before use, the reagents were frozen in the liquid nitrogen trap to remove the possible traces of water vapor or other admixtures.
NMR Samples Preparation
To prepare the sample for NMR measurements, the activated zeolite sample, Zn2+/H-BEA or ZnO/H-BEA, was placed into highly symmetric ampules made of the Pyrex glass tubes (outer diameter 3.0 or 5.5 mm) and was further loaded with propane from the gas phase by cooling the zeolite to liquid nitrogen temperature. Loading of propane was 300 μmol per gram of dehydrated zeolite sample. Finally, the glass tube was sealed with flame and kept at liquid nitrogen temperature prior to NMR measurements.
NMR Measurements
All measurements were performed on a Bruker Avance-400 NMR spectrometer (9.4 T) equipped with broad-band double-resonance MAS NMR probes (7 or 4 mm rotor diameter). The samples in the sealed glass ampules were tightly inserted into MAS rotors and spun at 3 kHz (7 mm rotor) or 5–9 kHz (4 mm rotor) with dry compressed air. 13C MAS NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature at the resonance frequency of 100.63 MHz. The length of the 90° pulse was 5.5 μs, and 2000–4000 scans were accumulated with the repetition delay of 10 s. High power proton decoupling was applied during signal acquisition at the power level equivalent to 5.0 μs length of 90° 1H pulse. Cross-polarization (13C CP/MAS NMR) spectra were accumulated with the contact time of 2 ms and the Hartmann–Hahn matching condition of 50 kHz. From 30000 to 60000 scans were accumulated for each 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum with 2 s delay between the scans. 1H MAS NMR spectra (24 scans, 4 s repetition delay) were recorded at 400.13 MHz with the use of Hahn-echo pulse sequence (π/2−τ–π–τ–acquisition), where the delay τ is equal to one rotor period and the length of π/2 excitation pulse is 5.0 μs. To minimize the time for temperature stabilization during in situ1H MAS NMR kinetic measurements, the NMR probe with rotating sample was preheated at the temperatures lower by 50–60 K than the reaction temperature. Then the temperature was quickly raised within several minutes to the target temperature, the sample was kept at the reaction temperature for 5 min, and then the measurement of kinetics started. The temperature was controlled by a variable-temperature unit (Bruker BVT-1000) during in situ1H MAS NMR kinetic measurements. The method of 207Pb MAS NMR chemical shift thermometer (40) was applied to calibrate the temperature inside MAS NMR rotor with an accuracy of ±1 K. Chemical shifts in the 13C and 1H NMR spectra were referenced to TMS as an external standard.
GC-MS Analysis
The products of propane conversion were analyzed with GC-MS (Agilent 7000B GC/MS chromatograph, VF-5 ms column) after the reaction was performed in the sealed ampule. The sealed glass ampule was opened, and the products were extracted with Et2O at ambient temperature. The oven program started from 323 K followed by 8 K/min heating up to 553 K. The evaporation temperature was 573 K. The injected sample volume was 0.8 μL. The mass spectra were obtained with the following parameters: electron ionization of 70 eV and scanning regime in the m/z range 40–500.
Kinetics Modeling
Modeling of the experimental kinetic curves was performed on the basis of the Runge–Kutta method for solving of a set of kinetic equations, corresponding to the suggested reaction network, with the use of Mathcad 15.0 software.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Propane Transformation on ZnO/H-BEA Zeolite Monitored by 13C MAS NMR
Propane-1-13C
Figure 1 shows 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of propane-1-13C adsorbed on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite after heating the sample at 296–573 K. The corresponding 13C MAS NMR spectra are shown in Figure S1. The intense resonance at 16.0 ppm belongs to 13C-labeled methyl groups of the initial propane (Figure 1a and Figure S1a). Heating of the sample at 473 K for 6 h results in the appearance of a broad and weak signal at 110 ppm and a more narrow one at 19.6 ppm from the CH2= and −CH3 groups of propene formed at propane dehydrogenation (Figure 1b and Figure S1b). (24,30) These two signals for the terminal groups of propene stem from the 13C-labeled methyl group of propane. Further heating of the sample at 573 K results in the increase of the intensity of the signals at 19.6 and 110 ppm from propene and the appearance of the signals at 26.5 and 93 ppm from the −CH2– and CH2= groups of the σ-allylzinc species (Zn–CH2–CH═CH2) (24) formed in the course of further dehydrogenation of propene (Figure 1c and Figure S1c).
Figure 1
Figure 1. Evolution of 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of propane-1-13C adsorbed on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite. The zeolite sample with adsorbed propane was successively heated at 296 K for 1 day (a), 473 K for 6 h (b), 573 K for 15 min (c) and for 1 h (d), 623 K for 1 h (e), and 673 K for 1 h (f). The corresponding 13C MAS NMR spectra are shown in Figure S1.
Besides, the signals of ethane (5.7 ppm) and methane (−8.4 ppm), and the signal at 12.5 ppm, presumably from the methyl groups of propene oligomers, appeared in the spectrum at 573 K. Also, the signal at 17.2 ppm of initially unlabeled −CH2– group of propane becomes visible in the spectrum because of 13C-label scrambling in unreacted propane at T ≥ 573 K (21,22) (Figure 1d and Figure S1d). The signals at 20.0 and 130 ppm (150 ppm) belong to the methyl groups and aromatic rings of simple (toluene and xylenes) and condensed aromatics formed from propane on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite at 623 and 673 K (Figure 1e,f). In quantitative 13C MAS NMR spectra, mainly the signals from methane and ethane are visible at these temperatures (Figure S1e,f). According to literature data, methane and ethane are formed by two possible pathways: propane hydrogenolysis and cracking of propene oligomers. (24,30) At T ≥ 623 K, the demethanation of methyl-substituted aromatics as well as ethane hydrogenolysis (25) can also contribute to the formation of some quantity of methane. Therefore, the intensity of methane signal is higher than that of ethane (Figure S1f).
Propane-2-13C
Heating of propane-2-13C on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite at 573 K results in the appearance of the signal at 165 ppm from the labeled −CH= group of propene (24) (Figure 2). The signal is shifted by about 33 ppm downfield with regard to gaseous propene or weakly adsorbed propene on bulk ZnO (132 ppm). (26,41) A large downfield shift is indicative of strong propene interaction with Zn species (24,30) present in the form of small ZnO clusters located inside the zeolite pores. The signal of the −CH= group of σ-allylzinc species (Zn–CH2–CH═CH2), which is also formed at this temperature, presumably coincides with the signal of the propene −CH= group at 165 ppm as was concluded earlier. (24) Interestingly, the spectrum of propane-2-13C after heating at 573 K indicates the presence of 13C atoms in the =CH2 (93 ppm) and the −CH2– (26.5 ppm) groups of σ-allylzinc species, although −CH3 groups were not labeled with 13C isotope in the initial propane-2-13C. The appearance of these resonances can be referred to the 13C-label scrambling process either in propane or in propene formed due to propane dehydrogenation at this temperature. The signals from methane (−8.4 ppm) and ethane (5.7 ppm) are also detected in the spectrum at 573 K. The intensity of the signal of ethane is essentially larger compared to that of methane (Figure S2). This may imply a notable contribution of direct cracking or hydrogenolysis of propane under these conditions. (24) Indeed, direct hydrogenolysis of propane-2-13C should give ethane-13C1 and unlabeled methane. This should result in an intense signal of ethane and a very weak signal of methane in the 13C NMR spectra.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Evolution of 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of propane-2-13C adsorbed on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite. The zeolite sample with adsorbed propane was successively heated at 296 K for 1 day (a), 473 K for 6 h (b), 573 K for 15 min (c) and for 1 h (d), and 623 K for 1 h (e). The corresponding 13C MAS NMR spectra are shown in Figure S2.
At 623 K, mainly the signals at 20.0 and 130 ppm from aromatic products and the products of propane hydrogenolysis (cracking), ethane, and methane, besides weak signals of σ-allylzinc species (26.5 ppm) and methyl groups of propene oligomers (12.5 ppm), are observed in the spectrum (Figure 2 and Figure S2).
3.2. Propane Transformation on Zn2+/H-BEA Zeolite Monitored by 13C MAS NMR
Propane-1-13C
Figure 3a and Figure S3a show 13C MAS NMR spectra for propane-1-13C adsorbed on Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite. Contrary to propane transformation on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite, the signals from propene (19.6 and 110 ppm) and σ-allylzinc species (26.5 and 93 ppm) appear in the spectrum already after 15 min heating at 473 K for propane-1-13C on Zn2+/H-BEA (Figure 3b). Further heating of the sample at 473 K for 6 h affords the redistribution of the signal intensities between propene and σ-allylzinc in favor of the latter species (Figure 3c). Also, upon increasing the reaction time at 473 K from 15 min to 6 h, gradual growth of the signal intensities is observed for both ethane (5.7 ppm) and methane (−8.4 ppm) (Figure S3b,c). The signal from the Zn–methyl species (−20 ppm) (15,37,42) also becomes visible after sample heating at 473 K (Figure S3c). Further heating of the sample at 523 K results in the disappearance of propene signals and appearance of the broad resonances at 115 and 140 ppm, presumably from the C═C double bonds of oligomeric olefins (Figure 3d). However, the signals from σ-allylzinc and Zn–methyl species continue increasing in the intensity (Figure 3d and Figure S3d). Subsequent heating of the sample at 573 and 623 K gives mainly simple (toluene and xylenes) and condensed aromatics with the signal at 20.0 ppm from the methyl groups and broad signals at 130 and 140 ppm from aromatic rings (Figure 3e–g and Figure S3e–g). A small quantity of σ-allylzinc, propene oligomers, and Zn–methyl species is still detectable in the spectrum (Figure 3e). Basically, the signals of methane and ethane and the weak signals of the methyl group of aromatics (20.0 ppm) and the −CH2– group of σ-allylzinc are detected in the 13C MAS NMR spectrum at 573 K (Figure S3e). Interestingly, the signal at −20 ppm from Zn–methyl species (15) formed from methane generated in the course of the reaction is observed in the spectrum at temperature above 473 K (Figure 3c–e).
Figure 3

The zeolite sample with adsorbed propane was successively heated at 296 K for 1 day (a), 473 K for 15 min (b), 473 K for 6 h (c), 523 K for 1 h (d), 573 K for 15 min (e), 573 K for 1 h (f), and 623 K for 1 h (g). The corresponding 13C MAS NMR spectra are shown in Figure S3.
Propane-2-13C
Propane-2-13C adsorbed on Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite exhibits a signal at 17.2 ppm (Figure 4a). The signal at 165 ppm, which is a common signal for the −CH= groups of propene and σ-allylzinc species, becomes detectable in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum at 423 K; it survives heating at 523 K (Figure 4b–f). At 473 K, the signals at 93 and 26.5 ppm from the =CH2 and −CH2– groups of σ-allylzinc species and the signal from the −CH3 group of propene at 19.6 ppm appear in the spectrum because of the 13C-label scrambling (Figure 4e). At 523 K, propene oligomers are formed with the signals at 12.5 ppm (−CH3) and 115 ppm (=CH2). The signals from the −CH2– groups of the oligomers may have a contribution to the signal at 26.5 ppm. Interestingly, a broad signal at about 200 ppm arises in the spectrum at 523 K (Figure 4f). This resonance can only be detected with the use of higher MAS rate (9 kHz) when spinning sidebands are minimized in the spectrum. This signal together with the signal at 140 ppm can be reasonably assigned to pentamethylbenzenium cation, (43,44) formed as an intermediate for propane transformation to simple aromatic molecules. Also, the signal at 200 ppm together with the signal at 93 ppm may be alternatively assigned to alkyl-substituted allene intermediates; (45) their formation from σ-allylzinc was suggested at propane transformation to aromatics on Zn/H-BEA. (24) At T ≥ 573 K, the signals from the simple and condensed aromatics are detected at 20.0, 130, and 150 ppm (Figure 4g–i). Similar to the case with propane-1-13C, the Zn–methyl species (−20 ppm) is present at temperatures above 523 K (Figure 4f–i) as a result of the interaction of methane generated in the course of the reaction with zinc sites.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Evolution of 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of propane-2-13C adsorbed on Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite. The zeolite sample with adsorbed propane was successively heated at 296 K for 1 day (a), 423 K for 30 min (b), 473 K for 15 min (c), 473 K for 1 h (d), 473 K for 6 h (e), 523 K for 30 min (f), 573 K for 15 min (g), 573 K for 1 h (h), and 623 K for 1 h (i). The corresponding 13C MAS NMR spectra are shown in Figure S4.
13C MAS NMR spectra have shown a gradual decrease of propane quantity (17.2 ppm), the appearance of the signal from ethane (5.7 ppm) at 423 K with subsequent decrease of its intensity, and increasing amount of methane at T > 573 K (Figure S4). As we have already noted (vide supra), methane and ethane can be formed by different pathways, including propane and ethane hydrogenolysis, propene oligomers cracking, and demethanation of methyl-substituted aromatics.
3.3. What We Have Concluded from the Analysis of 13C NMR Spectra
Analysis of the 13C MAS NMR spectra of the 13C-labeled propane allows us to conclude that both Zn-modified zeolites, Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA, exhibit similar regularities of propane transformation to aromatics, resembling earlier observations on Zn/H-BEA. (24) Propene and σ-allylzinc species as the products of propane dehydrogenation and the intermediates for propane aromatization are detected in both cases. However, for Zn2+/H-BEA, the formation of propene and σ-allylzinc species occurs already at 473 K, whereas it requires higher temperature (573 K) on ZnO/H-BEA. The aromatic products are observed at 573 K on Zn2+/H-BEA, while on ZnO/H-BEA the aromatics is formed only at T > 623 K. Therefore, higher temperature is required for propane aromatization on ZnO/H-BEA.
For both zeolite samples, propane aromatization process is accompanied by significant production of lower alkanes (ethane and methane) under our conditions of closed reactor. Both ethane and methane are detected for propane-1-13C, whereas there is no methane observed for propane-2-13C on Zn2+/H-BEA at initial propane conversion. This is a reasonable observation for propane with the selective 13C label at either the C1 or C2 position, if propane undergoes direct hydrogenolysis on Zn-modified zeolite. (8)
In contrast, initial conversion of propane-1-13C on ZnO/H-BEA (T = 473 K) yields only ethane and propene (the signals at 5.7 and 19.6 ppm) (Figure S1b). Methane is not formed along with ethane. Neither the signal of methane nor the signals of methoxy or Zn–methyl species, as the possible products of further methane transformation, are found in the 13C MAS NMR spectra under these conditions. Hence, the direct hydrogenolysis mechanism, which can be suggested for propane on Zn2+/H-BEA, cannot explain some of the reaction steps of propane conversion on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite. Therefore, some different mechanism should be proposed for the initial stages of propane transformation on ZnO/H-BEA to account for only ethane formation at temperatures around 473 K.
Zn–methyl species as a product of further methane transformation is observed on Zn2+/H-BEA. The species is not detected at propane transformation on ZnO/H-BEA. This supports an earlier finding on methane transformation on both Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA (15) that Zn–methyl is not formed from methane on ZnO/H-BEA.
For propane-2-13C on Zn2+/H-BEA, 13C NMR signals at 200 and 140 ppm are detected in addition to earlier observations. They are assigned to one more possible intermediate of propane aromatization, either pentamethylbenzenium cation or alkyl-substituted allene.
Thus, the general regularities of propane transformation are similar for both zeolite samples. Both Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA provide the dehydrogenation and aromatization of propane. The similar intermediates, π-complex of propene, σ-allylzinc species, possibly allene species, or pentamethylbenzenium cations, have been identified. The peculiarity of Zn2+/H-BEA is that the aromatization and hydrogenolysis of propane on this zeolite sample occur at lower temperature (by ∼100 K) compared to the reaction occurrence on ZnO/H-BEA. This indicates a higher activity for propane aromatization of the zeolite sample containing Zn2+ cations with respect to that one with ZnO species.
3.4. Monitoring the Kinetics of Propane Transformation with 1H MAS NMR in Situ
Figure 5a and Figure 5S show the evolution of 1H MAS NMR spectrum with reaction time at 553 K for propane adsorbed on Zn2+/H-BEA. The signals of the −CH2– group (1.4 ppm) and the −CH3 groups (1.0 ppm) of propane decrease to zero within 400–500 min. The signal of ethane (0.8 ppm), which coalesces in part with the signal of the −CH3 groups of propane, shows rapid increase of the intensity with subsequent decrease with much slower rate. The signal of methane (0.0 ppm) steadily increases up to the reaction time of 1500 min.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Stack plot of 1H MAS NMR spectra of propane on Zn2+/H-BEA (a) and ZnO/H-BEA (b) zeolites at 553 K. Time interval between successive spectra recording is 30 min (a) and 80 min (b).
Figure 5b shows the reaction of propane on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite affords similar kinetics behavior with respect to the formation of two main products (ethane and methane) detectable in the 1H MAS NMR spectra. However, propane conversion and the formation of ethane and methane occur notably slower on the ZnO/H-BEA sample as compared to those on Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite under the same reaction conditions (cf. Figures 5a and 5b). These observations confirm the conclusion of 13C MAS NMR data that zinc species present in the zeolite pores in the form of Zn2+ cations provides a higher activity with respect to propane transformation.
The conditions of our kinetic measurements do not allow the observation of the broad and low intensity signals or the signals with long relaxation times due to limited time for the recording of each spectrum at kinetics monitoring with 1H MAS NMR. Hence, we were not able to reliably identify the signals of some expected intermediates and products that have been revealed with 13C CP/MAS NMR (Figures 1–4), including propene, surface σ-allylzinc, propene oligomers, and aromatics. This limits us to monitor directly only three kinetic curves for propane, ethane, and methane with 1H MAS NMR (Figure 6 and Figure S6a–d). The kinetic curves for other products present on the surface of the catalyst can be derived from the overall balance of H and C atoms (see curves designated as “H surface” and “C surface” in Figure S6e,f). The total ratio H:C among the surface products gradually decreases with the reaction time (Figure S6g,h), reflecting the formation of more unsaturated with hydrogen hydrocarbons in the course of propane transformation to aromatics. The released hydrogen atoms are disposed further in the saturated hydrocarbon products, ethane or methane, detected in our kinetic experiments. Having compared the kinetics for two zeolite samples, we conclude that Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite forms a mixture of less saturated hydrocarbons (H:C = 1.2) from propane on the zeolite surface (Figure S6g) than ZnO/H-BEA zeolite (H:C = 1.6) (Figure S6h). Hence, zeolite modified with ZnO clusters is less effective in either dehydrogenation of the surface products or in disposal of H atoms released from the surface intermediates to form ethane and methane.
Figure 6
Figure 6. Experimental kinetic curves (points) of propane transformation and the formation of ethane and methane on Zn2+/H-BEA at 543–573 K. Simulated kinetic curves (solid lines) were obtained on the basis of Scheme 1; the corresponding rate constants k1–k6 are shown in Arrhenius plots (Figure 8).
Composition of aromatic products formed at propane transformation at 573 K was analyzed with GC-MS after the products extraction from the zeolite with Et2O. Both zeolite samples, Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA, yield almost the same composition of the aromatic compounds (Table S2) with the prevalence of toluene (25–28%) and p-xylene (27–29%). Minor differences between the two zeolite samples are related to the absence of ethyldimethylbenzene among the products extracted from Zn2+/H-BEA. The GC-MS data support that the simple aromatic compounds represent the main constituents, corresponding to the products at the end of kinetics with the final H:C ratio of 1.2 and 1.6 for the surface products identified with 1H MAS NMR on Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA, respectively (Figure S6e,f).
Experimental kinetic curves, in terms of hydrocarbon concentrations at temperatures 543–573 K, are shown in Figures 6 and 7. On Zn2+/H-BEA, nearly equal amounts of ethane and methane are formed at the beginning of the kinetics (Figure 6). In addition, ethane kinetic curve exhibits a maximum due to ethane conversion to methane. (25) In the final part of the kinetics, the rate of methane formation appears to exceed the rate of ethane conversion. This might be related to an additional route of methane formation by the demethanation of the simple methyl-substituted aromatics, besides direct ethane hydrogenolysis (8) producing two methane molecules from ethane.

Figure 7. Experimental kinetic curves (points) of propane transformation and the formation of ethane and methane on ZnO/H-BEA at 543–573 K. Simulated kinetic curves (solid lines) were obtained on the basis of Scheme 1 (with an additional kinetic step k7, see text). The corresponding rate constants k1–k7 are shown in Arrhenius plots (Figure 8).
A different behavior is demonstrated by ZnO/H-BEA zeolite at the initial part of the kinetics. Clearly, the quantity of ethane formed is larger than that of methane, though the initial rates for ethane and methane are not very different when extrapolated to zero conversion (Figure 7). Methane kinetic curve tends to have a kink point where the rate of methane formation is sharply changed to a lower value. The effect is more pronounced at lower temperatures (see kinetics at 543–553 K in Figure 7). These findings support the conclusion of 13C MAS NMR data that ethane formation at the initial stages of propane transformation on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite contradicts the hydrogenolysis mechanism (vide supra). We have further applied the kinetics modeling to describe these distinct features in the kinetic behavior of propane on Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites.
Kinetics Modeling of Propane Transformation on Zn2+/H-BEA
A kinetic scheme for propane transformation (Scheme 1) was adopted from ref (24). We regard this scheme as a minimal required set of reaction steps that allow modeling the experimental kinetics. The first step implies propene formation by propane dehydrogenation (k1). The released hydrogen atoms are involved in propane hydrogenolysis (k2), yielding equal amounts of ethane and methane. This step quickly reduces available hydrogen, while further stage of propene aromatization (k5) affords additional amounts of hydrogen. Without step k5, the highest possible ethane and methane quantities would be essentially lower compared to the experimentally observed ones due to a lack of hydrogen atoms for the hydrogenolysis step. When most of the propane is consumed, the kinetics is dominated by three reaction steps: ethane dehydrogenation (k3), hydrogenolysis (k4), and aromatization (k6). We assume that aromatization steps (k5, k6) lead to a single aromatic product toluene (C7H8). Its composition (with regard to C and H quantity in aromatic product) represents a close approximation to the average composition of the products found from GC-MS analysis (Table S2). Aromatization of an olefin is characterized by a single parameter (rate constant k5 or k6). The intermediate stages of oligomerization, cyclization, and dehydrogenation are omitted in Scheme 1. We have found it necessary to include the reversal step of propene hydrogenation (k–1) for describing a slowdown of propane conversion in the final part of experimental propane kinetics shown in Figure 6. In a similar manner, the reversal hydrogenation of ethene to ethane (k–3) is allowed by Scheme 1. This reversal step may virtually include the pathway of cracking of olefin oligomers, which is an alternative route for propane (ethane) formation. However, the suggestion presumes some unreasonable values of activation barriers that could be estimated for k–1 and k–3 within the frame of Scheme 1.
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Kinetic Scheme for Propane Conversion by Aromatization and Hydrogenolysis
Scheme 1 with the steps k1–k6 offers a fairly good description of the experimental kinetics shown in Figure 6. We found that the variation of the rate constants k3, k–3, and k6 affected the similar parts of the simulated kinetic curves in Figure 6. Therefore, independent determination of these constants via fitting to the experimental points is hindered. To obtain a reasonable description of the kinetics for propane at various temperatures, we have assumed that the activation barriers for ethane dehydrogenation (k3) and aromatization (k6) are close to those ones of propane (k1, k5). The estimated values of rate constants k1–k6 are shown in the form of Arrhenius plots (Figure 8).

Rate constants are grouped as follows: (a) the dehydrogenation of propane C3 (k1) and ethane C2 (k3); (b) the hydrogenolysis of propane C3 (k2) and ethane C2 (k4) plotted together with the rate constant k7; (c) aromatization of propene C3= (k5) and ethene C2= (k6). The corresponding activation barriers (E1–E7) are shown in Table S3.
Kinetics Modeling of Propane Transformation on ZnO/H-BEA
Taking into account the conclusions based on 13C MAS NMR data on the similarity of the propane aromatization pathways for Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA, we assume that Scheme 1 should properly describe the essential features of propane transformation on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite as it does for Zn2+/H-BEA. However, the initial part of the kinetics in Figure 7 with decreased formation of methane as compared to ethane implies some additional kinetic steps because it cannot be described within the frame of Scheme 1. The observed ratio between ethane and methane on ZnO/H-BEA is notable and cannot be rationalized entirely in terms of the known mechanisms for propane activation and transformation on Brønsted or zinc sites. (3,15,24,46) Indeed, protolytic scission of the C–C bond in propane on BAS is expected to afford primarily methane and ethene. (3) One can suggest further that zinc sites rapidly hydrogenate ethylene to ethane. In this case, the ethane quantity cannot exceed that of methane under this assumption because of concurrent oligomerization and aromatization of ethane. With regard to the activation of propane by zinc sites, the propylzinc intermediate is presumably formed first, followed by β-hydride elimination leading to propene. (46) One may assume the other pathway of propylzinc decomposition via methyl group transfer to form methylzinc species and ethylene (Scheme S1). In this case, a higher yield of ethane in the gas phase compared to that of methane can be expected, if ethene hydrogenation occurs faster than releasing of methyl fragment from the surface. However, we have never observed methylzinc species on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite with 13C MAS NMR. (15) Moreover, the pathway of methyl group transfer in the propylzinc intermediate is energetically unfavorable. (46) We also reject the hypothesis that additional amounts of ethane may be formed by cracking of propene oligomers on ZnO/H-BEA because it does not explain the sharp change in the methane formation rate, which is observed in the kinetics at 543–563 K (Figure 7).
A reasonable explanation of the increased ethane formation could be based on the hydrogenolysis mechanism proposed earlier (see Scheme 1, pathway 2, in ref (24)), where both BAS and ZnO species were suggested to be involved in the activation and hydrogenolysis of propane. This mechanism implies that methane is released from methylzinc before ethane is released from the ethoxy species. Alternatively, one may consider that the key step in the hydrogenolysis mechanism represents a formation of ethylzinc and methoxy species from propylzinc species (Scheme S2). In this case, a decreasing rate of methane formation during the kinetics could be related to the accumulation of surface methoxy species. Because the methoxy species are not found in the 13C MAS NMR spectra, such a mechanism does not account for different quantity of the formed methane and ethane in the experimental kinetics on ZnO/H-BEA.
Thus, we conclude that initial propane transformation by its hydrogenolysis occurs by the mechanism suggested earlier (24) with the formation of equal amounts of methane and ethane. Because we do not observe formation of propylzinc species on ZnO/H-BEA in the 13C MAS NMR spectra, it is likely that the formation of propylzinc is followed by fast scission of C–C bond in propylzinc (Scheme 2a). Protolysis of the C–C bond in propylzinc may proceed more easily due to electron density donation from zinc oxide cluster. Methane accumulated in the course of hydrogenolysis can initiate a process of methane dissociative adsorption (Scheme 2b). One can assume that methylzinc species with high electron density facilitates the C–C bond rapture in a similar way as ZnO species does (Scheme 2a). This may lead to ethylzinc and ethoxy fragments which afford two ethane molecules (Scheme 2c). Methane and propane may produce two molecules of ethane by this scheme. Under these assumptions, an increased ethane formation at the expense of methane may be expected in the kinetics of propane conversion on ZnO/H-BEA. The process indicated by Scheme 2c does not occur on Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite, presumably because of higher stability of methylzinc species formed on Zn2+ cations compared to ZnO clusters. Note that methylzinc species survives 673 K heating on Zn2+/H-BEA (Figure 4i), whereas it is not detected on ZnO/H-BEA at all.

For kinetic modeling of propane conversion on ZnO/H-BEA we have taken the reaction steps 1–6 of Scheme 1 and the additional step 7.
(7)
Step 7 represents the pathway of ethane formation described by Scheme 2. Similar to the case of Zn2+/H-BEA discussed above, the activation barriers for alkane dehydrogenation steps (rate constants k1 and k3) were assumed to be similar for modeling the experimental kinetics of propane on ZnO/H-BEA at various temperatures, and a similar assumption was made with respect to the aromatization steps k5 and k6. Figure 7 demonstrates that a decent description of the experimental kinetics can be achieved on the basis of the applied kinetic scheme by fitting the parameters k1–k7 to the experimental points. Thus, the results of kinetics modeling support a possible involvement of methane in the reaction of propane hydrogenolysis to yield two ethane molecules.
This conclusion encourages further studies concerning methane and propane co-conversion into valuable chemicals. Previously, methane involvement into propane aromatization on Zn-modified zeolite has been claimed to occur through alkylation of benzene ring by surface methoxy species. (47) Moreover, such a process requires the presence of molecular oxygen to oxidize methylzinc to methoxy species. (16) It seems unlikely that sufficient amount of aromatic molecules could be present on the surface of ZnO/H-BEA at the beginning of propane transformation kinetics (Figure 7) for the effective methane consumption via aromatics methylation. Therefore, the current study allows us to suggest that in the case of zeolite BEA containing zinc in the form of ZnO clusters a pathway may exist for methane co-conversion with propane that occurs at early stages of propane transformation and does not need aromatic molecules on the surface of the catalyst. This issue deserves further investigations.
Elaborating the Difference between Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA Performances
Arrhenius plots for the determined rate constants are compared for Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA in Figure 8. Kinetic analysis confirms that Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite is more active toward the dehydrogenation/aromatization of propane and hydrogenolysis process as compared to ZnO/H-BEA zeolite (Figure 8a,b). Within the frame of Scheme 1, the rate constants k5 and k6 characterizing the aromatization step were determined to be ∼1 order of magnitude larger on Zn2+/H-BEA (Figure 8c). A similar conclusion can be made with respect to the hydrogenolysis pathway which is described by the rate constants k2 and k4 (Figure 8b). We find that on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite the rate constant k6 (ethene aromatization) should be much lower than k5 (propene aromatization) within the frame of Scheme 1 (Figure 8c). Probably, the activity of these two olefins toward their aromatization is not much different and the obtained rate constants more likely reflect peculiarities of the involvement of hydrogen atoms into the hydrogenolysis process on this catalyst.
Activation energies estimated on the basis of Scheme 1 are shown in Table S3 and referred to intrinsic activation barriers. (48) The values obtained for the Zn2+/H-BEA sample coincide with those ones determined previously for the Zn-modified BEA zeolite prepared by the impregnation and containing zinc species of various types. (24) Thus, the activity of that sample appears to be referred to the presence of Zn2+ cations. For the propane dehydrogenation step, the activation barriers were found to be 60 kJ/mol for both Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites. This estimation is lower compared to monomolecular dehydrogenation of alkanes (140–200 kJ/mol) on acidic zeolites (34,49−52) or metal-containing zeolites. (53−55) For olefin aromatization step, we estimate the activation energies of 93–145 kJ/mol (Table S3), which is close to the value of 125 kJ/mol (52) related to the formation or cracking of olefin oligomers. Note that other investigations of the oligomerization or aromatization processes on different zeolites gave lower values of the activation energies (50–80 kJ/mol). (56−59) Curiously, ethane formation via reaction step k7 is characterized by relatively small activation barrier (76 kJ/mol) within the frame of Scheme 1. In this regard, this process does not become evident with the increase of the reaction temperature above 563 K due to the acceleration of hydrogenolysis process.
The zeolite sample containing zinc in the form of Zn2+ cations tends to have lower activation barriers than the sample with loaded ZnO species. Indeed, lower activation energies were obtained for alkane hydrogenolysis (E2, E4) and olefin aromatization steps (E5, E6) on Zn2+/H-BEA (see Table S3). Taking into account recently reported results (39) and the data of this study, we infer that Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite performs activation of C–H bonds in propane followed by its dehydrogenation and aromatization faster than ZnO/H-BEA zeolite. The intermediate, propene, is more strongly retained by Zn2+ cations in the form of π-complex and σ-allylzinc species than by zinc oxide clusters, which does not hamper the aromatization process on Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite. In contrast, ZnO/H-BEA zeolite, being a more effective aromatization catalyst than pure acidic zeolite, is less active compared to Zn2+/H-BEA. Importantly, ZnO/H-BEA zeolite seems to provide a pathway for methane co-conversion with propane at temperatures below 553 K. The last process is proposed on the basis of the kinetic analysis of methane and ethane formation as the products of propane hydrogenolysis step. This idea needs further verification because it may be of potential interest for the studies of methane transformation in the presence of propane under mild conditions on Zn-modified zeolites.
4. Conclusions
Zn-modified zeolite samples containing zinc in the form of either Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA) or small ZnO clusters (ZnO/H-BEA) have been examined for propane transformation to aromatics. The MAS NMR technique has been applied for the analysis of the surface products formed from propane (13C MAS NMR) and in situ kinetics measurements (1H MAS NMR) under the conditions of a closed microreactor. Analysis of the 13C MAS NMR spectra of the 13C-labeled propane has shown that both zeolite samples, Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA, exhibit similar regularities of propane transformation to aromatics. Propane undergoes dehydrogenation to form, successively, propene, stabilized in a form of the π-complex on Zn sites, and σ-allylzinc species. Both these species represent the intermediates for the process of propane aromatization. ZnO/H-BEA zeolite is less active compared to Zn2+/H-BEA and requires higher temperatures to achieve the same levels of propane conversion. On Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite, the formation of propene π-complex and σ-allylzinc species starts at 473 K, and aromatic products are observed at 573 K, whereas on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite these intermediates appear at 573 K and aromatics are formed at T > 623 K. Despite different activity, both zeolite samples yield similar composition of the aromatic products from propane according to GC-MS analysis of the extracted products, with toluene and p-xylene being the main constituents. On Zn2+/H-BEA, 13C MAS NMR signals at 200 and 140 ppm have been detected, which have been assigned to the pentamethylbenzenium cation or alkyl-substituted allene intermediates preceding the aromatics formation.
An essential amount of smaller alkanes (ethane and methane) is formed during propane aromatization on both Zn-modified zeolites. On Zn2+/H-BEA, nearly equal amounts of ethane and methane are produced from the very beginning of propane conversion due to propane hydrogenolysis. Such process is likely to arise from simultaneous action of neighboring Brønsted acid sites and Zn species for propane molecule activation leading to surface methylzinc and ethoxy fragments followed by the interaction with hydrogen atoms released in the dehydrogenation/aromatization steps. On ZnO/H-BEA, the ratio between propane hydrogenolysis products sharply changes during the kinetics, resulting in increased ethane formation at the expense of methane. The effect is more pronounced at temperatures below 553 K. It has been suggested that surface methylzinc species formed at methane dissociative adsorption might be involved into the scission of the C–C bond in the propylzinc intermediate, yielding surface ethylzinc and ethoxy fragments. Such a process seems to be impossible for Zn2+/H-BEA because of higher stability of the methylzinc species formed on zinc cations or the absence of proper vacant sites for the abstraction of a hydrogen atom during the insertion of methyl group from propane into Zn–CH3 fragment. Kinetic analysis supports the concept of possible co-conversion of propane with methane since other probable hypotheses give unsatisfactory kinetics modeling for ZnO/H-BEA. This finding is of potential interest in view of searching for the pathways for methane conversion into valuable chemicals. Kinetics analysis reveals that zinc species in the form of Zn2+ cations on the surface of the zeolite provide essential increase of the rate of propane conversion and lower activation barriers compared to zinc oxide clusters. This accounts for the higher activity of Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite in the process of propane aromatization or propane hydrogenolysis as compared to ZnO/H-BEA zeolite.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. Evolution of 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of propane-1-13C adsorbed on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite. The zeolite sample with adsorbed propane was successively heated at 296 K for 1 day (a), 473 K for 6 h (b), 573 K for 15 min (c) and for 1 h (d), 623 K for 1 h (e), and 673 K for 1 h (f). The corresponding 13C MAS NMR spectra are shown in Figure S1.

Figure 8. Arrhenius plots for the rate constants k1–k7 obtained from the modeling of the experimental kinetics of propane transformation on Zn2+/H-BEA (solid symbols) and ZnO/H-BEA (open symbols). Rate constants are grouped as follows: (a) the dehydrogenation of propane C3 (k1) and ethane C2 (k3); (b) the hydrogenolysis of propane C3 (k2) and ethane C2 (k4) plotted together with the rate constant k7; (c) aromatization of propene C3= (k5) and ethene C2= (k6). The corresponding activation barriers (E1–E7) are shown in Table S3.
