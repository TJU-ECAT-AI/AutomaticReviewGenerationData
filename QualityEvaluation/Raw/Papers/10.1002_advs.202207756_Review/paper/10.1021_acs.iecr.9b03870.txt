Abstract
The Cr/Al2O3 catalyst is a typical commercial catalyst system that has been widely applied for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Appreciable improvement in catalytic performance of this catalyst is of importance regarding its further applications, but investigations of the interaction between Ce and Cr species and the effects of Ce modification on the dispersion and distribution of the active Cr phases have seldom been concerned in the previous works. In this work, M/Al2O3 (M: Cr, Ce, and Ce–Cr) catalysts were synthesized and the Ce-modified catalyst exhibited enhanced activity. It was shown that modification of Ce on the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst decreased the amount of inactive isolated Cr(VI) sites. Meanwhile, the increased amount of oxygen vacancy was observed over the Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, which promoted the interaction between Ce and Cr species. The above results can be confirmed by the characterization results of X-ray diffraction, UV–vis, H2-temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, which provide meaningful information for improving catalytic performance of the commercial Cr/Al2O3 catalyst during PDH.

1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the raw materials for the synthesis of polymers such as acrylic acid, polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, and propylene oxide in the petrochemical industry. (1−5) The two main ways to obtain propylene are derived from the oil stock by steam and catalytic cracking of naphtha. Recently, compared with traditional methods, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) shows advantages in propylene yield and operating cost. (5,6) Furthermore, owing to the increased production of shale gas worldwide and uncertainty of future oil prices, PDH including oxidative PDH (OPDH) and nonoxidative PDH is regarded as an alternative to produce propylene. However, OPDH may cause deep oxidation of the reaction because of the presence of oxidants, thus reducing the selectivity of the product. (7,8) In contrast, PDH has received extensive attention because of its safety and high propylene yield. (9,10)
As a commercial catalyst, Cr/Al2O3 has been widely used in dehydrogenation plants, (e.g., PDH), because of its high activity and selectivity for the reaction and its good mechanical stability. (11−15) From the prospect of further applications, appreciable improvement in catalytic performance of this catalyst is of importance. Different promoters, such as transition-metal oxides (e.g., Ni, Co, Cu), are generally employed to enhance catalytic performance of Cr/Al2O3 because positive changes of the structure and physicochemical properties of the support are achieved with the addition of suitable promoters. (16−18) It has been reported that rare earth oxide ceria by Ce modification can increase catalytic performance of the supported catalysts by interacting with the support and/or increasing the dispersibility of the active metal component. (19,20) In fact, Ce was used as the promoter on the Cr-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (e.g., isobutane, propane, and ethylbenzene) because of its excellent oxygen storage capacity, which can enhance the reduction–oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, thereby increasing the activity of the catalyst. (21−26) However, investigations of the interaction between Ce and Cr species, and the effects of Ce modification on the dispersion and distribution of the active Cr phase have seldom been concerned in these works, especially for propane nonoxidative dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction. From this point of view, using CeO2 to modify Cr/Al2O3 for PDH arouses our interest in the present research.
As a matter of fact, different kinds of surface Cr species are reported to coexist on the Cr supported catalysts, causing difference in the catalytic performance for PDH. (7,10) It is indicated in our previous work that the presence of isolated Cr(VI) species decreases catalytic activity toward propane conversion and causes low selectivity of propylene during PDH process. (7) From this point of view, investigation of the effect of Ce modification on the distribution of active Cr species and the catalytic performance for PDH is meaningful. In our present work, Cr/Al2O3 modified with Ce as the promoter was evaluated in PDH. Moreover, the nature of active Cr sites and the positive effect of Ce modification were investigated and confirmed by the characterization results of X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–vis, H2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. The results indicated that the Ce-modified Cr/Al2O3 catalyst displayed improved activity. Furthermore, decreased amounts of in-active isolated Cr(VI) sites were seen on the Ce doped Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, while increased amounts of oxygen vacancy over the Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalyst promoted the interaction between Ce and Cr species.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Catalyst Preparation
Cr/Al2O3, Ce/Al2O3, and Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the isovolumetric impregnation method. The alumina support was impregnated with aqueous solutions of Cr(NO3)3·6H2O, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O or Cr(NO3)3·6H2O, and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O. The obtained samples were stirred and followed by drying at 90 °C for 6 h. After calcination treatment in air at 650 °C for 5 h, the catalysts were labelled as 5% Cr/Al2O3, 5% Ce/Al2O3, and 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 (loading content of both Ce and Cr are 5 wt %).
2.2. Characterization of Catalysts
XRD patterns of the obtained catalysts were measured on a Rigaku D/max-1200 diffractometer (using Cu Kα radiation, at 40 kV and 30 mA). The surface areas of the catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption at −196 °C using a NOVA 4200e instrument. All the catalysts were degassed at 300 °C for 3 h in the vacuum prior to analysis. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were surveyed at room temperature by using a Cary 500 spectrometer and recorded in the region of 250–800 nm. H2-TPR experiments were carried out by using a device equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Pretreatment of 100 mg of catalysts was conducted at 100 °C in a flow of H2/Ar (30 mL/min) for 1 h and then reduced from 100 to 700 °C (at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min).
XPS were studied to analyze the atomic state of surface chromium species. Correction was performed by referring to the characteristic binding energy (BE) of C 1s at 284.6 eV. Laser Raman spectra were obtained on a HORIBA Jobin Yvon XploRA spectrometer. The Raman spectrum has a wavelength of 532 nm and a laser power of 25 mW. TEM was obtained on a JEM-2010HR with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Propane and propylene temperature-programed desorption (C3H8-TPD, C3H6-TPD) experiments were performed on an AutoChem II 2920 (USA) automatic chemical adsorption instrument with a TCD analyzer. Before tests, 0.1 g of the sample was pretreated at 400 °C for 30 min, and subsequently cooled to room temperature. Afterward, the dried samples were saturated with 5% C3H8/N2 and 5% C3H6/N2 at 50 °C. Then, the samples were purged by N2 and subsequently heated to the required temperature at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The signals of desorbed compounds were detected by the TCD analyzer.
2.3. Activity Measurements of Catalysts
The PDH activities were assessed in a fixed bed microreactor with 400 mg of catalysts. Reaction conditions were recorded as follows: reaction gas = C3H8 (14%)/N2, temperature = 630 °C, atmospheric pressure, flow rate = 29 mL/min. In the PDH process, the concentrations of the reactants and products were analyzed by using an on-line gas chromatography in combination with TCD and FID detectors. The conversion of C3H8 and selectivity of C3H6 were calculated according to the following equation
Cin is the reaction gas inlet concentration, and Cout is the concentration of products in the outlet gas.
Besides, the turnover frequencie (TOF) calculation was performed by using the following equation (27,28)
where Cconversion is the concentration of substrate conversion (%), Ftotal is the flow rate of feed gas (mol/s), and MCr is the molar amount of Cr in the catalyst (mol) (based on Raman analysis).
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Activity Results
Different Ce loadings of Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalysts were optimized before experiment tests. The results show that the Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalyst with 5 wt % Ce loading has the best activity (results are provided in Figure S1 in Supporting Information). Subsequently, the PDH over 5% Cr/Al2O3 and 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 was performed, and the activity results are shown in Figure 1. It is seen from Figure 1a,b that both activity toward the conversion of C3H8 (Figure 1a) and the selectivity of C3H6 (Figure 1b) over 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 are higher than those on the sample of 5% Cr/Al2O3. Moreover, as observed from Figure 1a,b, it is obvious that the deactivation rate of the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalyst is slower than that of the 5% Cr/Al2O3 sample after 100 min of exposure. The above activity results illustrate that the Ce-modified Cr/Al2O3 catalyst displays enhanced catalytic performance during PDH process. In particular, the activity of the catalyst modified with Ce is still superior to that of the unmodified catalyst after eliminating the effects of internal and external diffusion (results are shown in Figure S2). Besides, in order to investigate the difference of intrinsic activity of Cr with and without Ce promoter, TOF calculation of the catalysts was performed. The data (as recorded in Table S1 in Supporting Information) show that the TOF of 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 is higher than that of 5% Cr/Al2O3, which indicates the improved activity of the Ce-modified catalyst.

Besides, as a commercial catalyst, multiple-cycle regeneration is necessary with regard to its industrial application. Accordingly, four regeneration cycles of the 5% Cr/Al2O3 and 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are investigated (the regeneration process of these spent catalysts are studied by switching the air flow of 30 mL/min at 630 °C for 1 h), and the results are shown in Figures 1c and S3 in Supporting Information. From Figure S3, it is clearly obtained that the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a slower deactivation rate when compared to the sample of 5% Cr/Al2O3 during multiple regeneration process. Surprisingly, the activity of the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 sample with four regeneration cycles is higher than that of the 5% Cr/Al2O3 sample with one regeneration cycle (as shown in Figure 1c). Therefore, it is deduced that Ce promoter results in a positive effect on the activity of the commercial Cr/Al2O3 catalyst during PDH process. In fact, the Ce/Al2O3 catalyst shows lower catalytic activity when compared to pure Al2O3 (as displayed in Figure S4 in Supporting Information). Thus, the positive effect from the interaction between Ce and Cr species to promote the catalytic performance of the Ce–Cr/Al2O3 sample is expected, and further characterization investigations are conducted subsequently to explain these results.
3.2. Characterization Results
The XRD patterns of the Al2O3-supported Cr, Ce, and Ce–Cr catalysts are presented in Figure 2a. As can be seen from Figure 2a, some diffraction peaks corresponding to (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), and (331) planes of the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 are found on the 5% Ce/Al2O3 and 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. (29) Moreover, the diffraction peaks attributed to the Cr2O3 crystallite are identified for the samples of 5% Cr/Al2O3 and 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3, (30) but the intensity of these diffraction peaks over the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalyst is lower than that of the 5% Cr/Al2O3 sample, indicating the better dispersion of Cr sites on the Ce-modified catalyst. (31)

Figure 2. (a) XRD patterns, (b) UV–vis spectra, and (c) H2-TPR profiles of 5% Cr/Al2O3 and 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.
The UV–vis spectra results are given in Figure 2b to investigate the oxidation state and coordination of Cr species in the catalyst. Two strong adsorption bands at about 269 and 365 nm, designated as ligand–metal charge transfer of Cr species (O → Cr6+), indicate the presence of Cr6+ species in the catalysts. (10,32−34) In particular, in the 5% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, the more prominent peak at about 365 nm is the characteristic of isolated Cr6+ sites, (7) suggesting the presence of a higher concentration of isolated Cr6+ in the catalyst without Ce addition (as a matter of fact, not all the Cr(VI) species are converted to inactive Cr(III) species at high Cr loading. Instead, some of them have not been anchored by the exhausted surface hydroxyl groups. As a result, some isolated Cr(VI) species are found. Schematic representation of the formation of isolated Cr(VI) species is exhibited in Figure S4 in Supporting Information). As a matter of fact, the existence of isolated Cr6+ species in the catalyst is proved to cause a negative effect on the catalytic performance during PDH. (7,33) From this point of view, the decrease in the amount of the isolated Cr6+ species in the Ce-modified Cr/Al2O3 catalyst is beneficial for the improvement of reactivity during PDH. Furthermore, two bands at about 460 and 614 nm, belonging to CrOx clusters or Cr2O3 of octahedral Cr3+, (10,32−34) are also detected on the 5% Cr/Al2O3 and 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, which are consistent with those observed in the XRD.
The H2-TPR analysis in Figure 2c is used to calculate the redox properties of the catalysts. It is seen from Figure 2c that the 5% Cr/Al2O3 and the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalysts display similar characteristics in the shape of the hydrogen consumption peak, where a significant peak at about 250–400 °C and a weak peak at about 400–475 °C are observed on both the catalysts. These peaks are generally represented for the Cr6+ species (the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+) that interact differently with the support. (35−40) It is worth noting that the peak intensity of the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 sample is higher than that of the 5% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, revealing the higher amount of Cr6+ species on the Ce-modified catalyst. Besides, from Figure 2c, it is also obtained that the reduction temperature of the 5% Cr/Al2O3 sample (ca. 324 °C) is lower than that of the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 sample (ca. 331 °C), suggesting a stronger interaction between Ce and Cr species over the Ce-doped sample, (41) as illustrated from the XRD results. In particular, the 5% Cr/Al2O3 sample exhibits a reduction peak at about 560 °C, while it is absent on the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. The high-temperature reduction peak is presumably caused by the presence of the isolated Cr6+ species, which is reported to be hardly reduced than other Cr6+ species. (7) Therefore, the H2-TPR data is consistent with the UV–vis and XRD results.
The effect of Ce incorporation on the oxidation state of Cr in the catalyst is analyzed by XPS, and the results are provided in Figure 3. It is seen from Figure 3 that the two peaks around 576 and 579 eV are respectively attributed to the existence of Cr3+ and Cr6+. (42−45) Subsequently, the relative percents of Cr3+ and Cr6+ over the 5% Cr/Al2O3 and the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are calculated and recorded in Figure 3 and Table 1. As obtained from Table 1, the ratio of Cr6+/Cr3+ increases from 0.32 to 0.433 when Ce is added to the 5% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, indicating that increased amounts of active Cr6+ sites are formed on the Ce-modified catalyst. Furthermore, the BEs of Cr3+ and Cr6+ of 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 are shifted to the higher one, while the BE of Ce4+ species are shifted to the lower one, showing that modification of Ce enhances the interaction between Ce and Cr species, (46) which is well in accordance with the above XRD and H2-TPR results. Besides, the spectrum of O 1s is displayed in Figure S4 in Supporting Information. It is observed that two peaks representing the existence of lattice oxygen (OL) and adsorption oxygen (OA) are appeared on the catalysts. (46) Surprisingly, from Figure S4, the relative percent of surface OL in the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 sample is higher than that of other catalysts; this could be caused by the existence of more oxygen vacancies in the Ce-doped Cr sample. It is revealed in our previous works that more amount of internal lattice oxygen contributes to the migration of internal lattice oxygen to supply surface lattice oxygen, (47) which may be conducive to the improvement of catalytic performance.

Raman spectra of the Al2O3-supported catalysts are shown in Figure 4. It is seen from Figure 4a that one shape line at about 466 cm–1, caused by the F2g vibration mode of oxygen surrounded by Ce, is found on the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 sample, (48) while it shows weak intensity on the sample of 5% Ce/Al2O3 (Figure 4d). Meanwhile, an overlapping peak of CeO2 and CrO3 at about 487 cm–1 (Figure 4a,d) is observed on both samples of 5% Ce/Al2O3 and 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3, while a sharp band at about 550 cm–1, attributed to Cr–O–Cr vibration of octahedrally coordinated in the crystal phase of Cr2O3, (49−53) can be only found on the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, one band at about 620 cm–1, corresponding to the vibration caused by crystal lattice relaxation near the oxygen vacancies as shown in Figure 4c, (54) obviously exhibited on the sample of 5% Ce/Al2O3, instead of the 5% Ce/Al2O3 catalyst. This shows that the Ce-modified Cr/Al2O3 catalyst leads to an increase in the amount of oxygen vacancies. Moreover, the peak deconvolution of the Raman band (from 700 to 1000 cm–1) shows the presence of five peaks (as plotted in Figure 4b). It is noted that all these five peaks are possibly originated from Cr6+ species with different forms. As a result, the peaks at about 830 and 890 cm–1 are likely attributed to the formation of trichromates or a higher degree of chromates, respectively. (55) The peak at about 860 cm–1 can be assigned to the symmetric stretching and bending modes of the tetrahedral surface of monochromate (Cr6+) species. (14) The peak at about 900–950 cm–1 can be assigned to the symmetric stretching mode of CrO2 units, (36) which is also reported to be resulted from the polymerization of the monomeric chromate units. (36,56) Obviously, from Figure 4b, the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 sample owns a higher amount of monochromate Cr6+ species than 5% Cr/Al2O3, indicating that the incorporation of Ce contributes the dispersion of Cr6+ on the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, which is consistent with the above mentioned XRD, UV–vis, and XPS results, and this should be in favour of improving the catalytic performance during PDH.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Raman spectra of the catalysts.
The morphology of the as-synthesized 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalyst was characterized by TEM (as displayed in Figure 5). It is obtained from Figure 5b that the two inequable lattice spacings (0.31 and 0.248 nm) are simultaneously detected on the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 sample, which are respectively corresponding to the (111) crystal plane of CeO2 and (120) crystal plane of Cr2O3. The overlap of the two lattice fringes demonstrates the interaction between Ce and Cr species, which is consistent with the above analysis. Additionally, C3H8-TPD tests of the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 and 5% Cr/Al2O3 samples are conducted. It is seen from Figure 6a that 5% Cr/Al2O3 and 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalysts display an obvious propane-desorbed signal in the temperature range of 30–300 °C. Especially, the propane-desorbed signals of 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 is much stronger than that of the 5% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, which illustrates a better catalytic activity toward C3H8 conversion during PDH process. (7) Furthermore, it is obtained from Figure 6b that 5% Cr/Al2O3 and 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 display propylene desorbed peaks in the temperature range of 50–200 °C. The temperature of the desorption peak generally reflects the extent of the interactions between propylene and catalysts. With the addition of Ce, the desorption peak of propylene on the 5% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst shifts from 119 °C to a lower temperature (about 113 °C), which indicates that the addition of Ce weakens the interaction between propylene and the catalyst, thereby reducing the adsorption amount of propylene and increasing the selectivity of propylene in the PDH. (57) Moreover, it is seen from Figure 6b that 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 displays a higher intensity peak than that of the 5% Cr/Al2O3 sample. In fact, higher intensity of the propene TPR peak is disadvantageous to propene selectivity because the intensive adsorption of propene on the catalyst generally leads to deep dehydrogenation reaction and coke deposition (coke deposition analysis of the spent catalysts are carried out by Raman spectroscopy, and the amount of the coke deposit over the 5% Ce–Cr/Al2O3 catalyst is lower than that over the 5% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst with the same exposure time (Figure S7 in Supporting Information)).

4. Conclusions
The modification of the commercial Cr/Al2O3 catalyst with rare earth Ce was synthesized and applied for PDH process. The results indicated that the Ce-modified catalyst exhibited improved catalytic activity toward C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity when compared with the unmodified catalyst. Moreover, the activity of the Ce-doped sample with four regeneration cycles was higher than that of the undoped sample with one regeneration cycle, suggesting that Ce promoter caused a positive effect on the performance of the commercial Cr/Al2O3 catalyst during PDH. The subsequent characterization results illustrated that decreased amounts of inactive isolated Cr(VI) sites were formed on the Ce-modified sample, while increased interaction between Ce and Cr species resulted from the formation of increased amounts of oxygen vacancy that was obtained on the Ce-modified catalyst. All the above characters for the Ce-modified sample should contribute to the improved catalytic performance of the commercial Cr/Al2O3 catalyst during PDH.
