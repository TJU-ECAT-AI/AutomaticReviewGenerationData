Hydrogen removal occurs by recombinative desorption and by hydrogen transfer during dehydro- 
genation steps required for alkane and cycloalkane conversion on Te/NaX, H-ZSM5, and Ga/H- 
ZSM5 catalysts. Recombinative desorption limits the rate of n-heptane and methylcyclohexane 
aromatization on Te/NaX and prevents equilibration between gas-phase H2 and H-adatoms formed 
in intermediate dehydrogenation steps. The resulting high surface hydrogen fugacities lead to low 
steady-state concentrations of required unsaturated intermediates. Te ions catalyze rate-limiting 
hydrogen desorption steps during alkane reactions on Te/NaX. On H-ZSM5, hydrogen removal 
limits the rate of propane conversion to aromatics. Hydrogen adatoms are removed predominantly 
by reactions with coadsorbed hydrocarbon fragments, leading to high cracking selectivity. Ga ions 
introduce a recombinative desorption function that partially relieves the resulting high hydrogen 
surface fugacities and allows dehydrogenation steps to occur without concurrent cracking. Thus, 
Ga ions increase aromatics selectivity by providing a "porthole" for the removal of hydrogen 
adatoms as dihydrogen. We propose that rate-limiting hydrogen desorption steps, and the high 
surface hydrogen fugacities that result, control the rate and selectivity of dehydrogenation and 
related reactions on many nonmetal surfaces.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Alkane rearrangements proceed via com- 
plex reaction sequences on metal and metal 
oxide surfaces (1, 2) and often require dehy- 
drogenated gas-phase and surface interme- 
diates (3). Previously, we described the in- 
termediate 
role 
of heptenes 
and 
cis- 
heptatrienes in n-heptane dehydrocycliza- 
tion on Te/NaX (4). Here, we examine the 
dehydrogenation and hydrogen desorption 
elementary steps that lead to unsaturated 
intermediates on Te/NaX, H-ZSM5, and 
Ga/H-ZSM-5.

(5-7) involve the release of H-atoms onto 
surface sites. Here, we show that many of 
these reactions, specifically alkane dehy- 
drogenation and dehydrocyclization on Te/ 
NaX and on related Ga- and Cr-based mate- 
rials, are limited by the rate of desorption 
of these H-adatoms (4). Desorption-limited 
reactions lead to virtual pressures (surface 
fugacities) that exceed the corresponding 
gas-phase pressure of the desorbing species 
(5, 8). In effect, the chemical potential of 
desorbing species increases by kinetic cou- 
pling with preceding elementary steps that 
form them; desorbing species are forced into 
the gas phase only after a significant in- 
crease in their effective surface fugacity and 
chemical potential. 
High hydrogen surface fugacities lead to 
low steady-state concentrations of alkene, 
diene, and triene species required in many 
dehydrocyclization reactions; these con-

centrations reflect thermodynamic equili- 
bration with existing surface hydrogen fu- 
gacities 
rather 
than 
with 
gas-phase 
hydrogen pressures. Our proposed mecha- 
nism explains the observed isotopic equili- 
bration of 13C and 12C between alkenes and 
alkanes, but not between these species and 
gas-phase deuterium. 
We suggest that high hydrogen surface 
fugacities also occur during hydrogen-trans- 
fer (5, 6) and disproportionation (7) reac- 
tions of hydrocarbons on surfaces. They 
arise because the catalytic surfaces are un- 
able to desorb hydrogen adatoms without 
raising their chemical potential and fugacity 
significantly above those in the ambient gas 
phase. These hydrogen-transfer reactions 
involve the addition and removal of hydro- 
gen atoms from a surface pool that remains 
largely nonequilibrated with gas-phase dihy- 
drogen. Consequently, such reactions kinet- 
ically resemble bimolecular transfer of H- 
atoms between two or more adsorbed hy- 
drocarbon species. 
2. BACKGROUND 
2.1. Catalytic Dehydrogenation/ 
Dehydrocyclization of AIkanes on 
Te/NaX Catalysts 
Te atoms with X- and Y-zeolites catalyze 
alkane dehydrocyclization (9-13); turnover 
rates, however, are much lower than on Pt- 
based catalysts (4). Isotopic tracer studies 
previously suggested that alkenes and other 
unsaturated species are reactive intermedi- 
ates in the catalytic sequence (14-17). Re- 
cent work confirmed these conclusions and 
provided independent evidence for n-hep- 
tane dehydrocyclization 
via thermal electro- 
cyclic addition reactions of cis-heptatrienes 
intermediates (4). 
2.2 Alkane Dehydrocyclodimerization on 
H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5 
Dehydrocyclodimerization of C2-C 
7 al- 
kanes occurs on Pt- (18-21) and Ga-(22-25) 
based catalysts by a complex sequence of 
dehydrogenation, dimerization, and cycli- 
zation steps that proceed in parallel with 
acid-catalyzed and thermal cracking reac- 
tions. Ga-based catalysts and moving-bed 
reactors are used in the CYCLAR process 
to convert C2-C4 alkanes to C~ aromatics 
(25). The oxidation state of 
Ga during cataly- 
sis and its role in the reaction sequence re- 
main unresolved; Ga-catalyzed alkane de- 
hydrogenation (32) and alkene cyclization 
(24) have been proposed to explain the en- 
hanced selectivity and activity of Ga-based 
catalysts in these reactions. Here, we sug- 
gest that Ga ions catalyze the desorption of 
H-adatoms as H 2 and thus lower surface 
hydrogen fugacities and cracking selec- 
tivity. 
2.3. Kinetic Coupling and Hydrogen 
Virtual Pressures at Catalytic Surfaces 
Temkin and Pyzhev (26, 27) proposed 
the concept of virtual pressure, created by 
"pumping" of intermediates onto a sur- 
face, to describe the kinetics of ammonia 
decomposition on Fe. This reaction is lim- 
ited by recombinative desorption of ad- 
sorbed nitrogen atoms (N*), a process that 
leads to nitrogen virtual pressures (i.e., 
dinitrogen pressures that would equilibrate 
with actual steady-state (N*) concentra- 
tions) much higher than those in the con- 
tacting gas phase. In effect, a virtual equi- 
librium is defined between any species 
being interconverted in a rate-limiting (i.e., 
exergic) step. 
Kemball (5) used virtual pressure con- 
cepts to explain the kinetics of ethane hy- 
drogenolysis and exchange reactions and 
the selectivity of CHa/D 2 and CO/H2 reac- 
tions; these reactions lead to surface over- 
pressures of CH~ species. Tamaru and co- 
workers (28, 29) measured nitrogen cover- 
ages directly during ammonia decomposi- 
tion on W and Mo foils by Auger electron 
spectroscopy. They found that surface ni- 
trogen coverages greatly exceed those pres- 
ent in equilibrium with ambient dinitrogen 
pressures. 
Boudart (30, 31) described the kinetic 
consequences of virtual pressures, more 
correctly defined as surface fugacities, by 
applying the De Donder equation for an ele-

where Ai is the affinity for the Rh reaction

(3) 
i 
where f is the thermodynamic activity or 
fugacity of species that participate in the ith 
reaction step as reactants (ui < 0) or prod- 
ucts (vi > 0). An equilibrated elementary 
step (Ai = 0) obeys the usual equilibrium 
expression 
[-[ f[i = eAOi/RT 
(4)

Rate-limiting steps are exergic (A i > O) 
and account for most of the affinity change 
in the overall reaction. Therefore,

and at steady state 
< 1. 
(6a) 
If subsequent steps are equilibrated, steady- 
state and equilibrium fugacities of the prod- 
ucts of the ith step are equal and Eq. (6a) 
becomes 
[I

(6b)

where f refers only to the fugacity of the 
reactants in the ith step. Clearly, then, 
77" 
i (flivil)ss > "17" 
i (f!vil)eq, 
(6c) 
and the fugacity of reactants involved in a 
rate-limiting step must exceed those of the 
products of the ith step. 
Every step in a reaction sequence must 
occur in the forward direction (Ai > 0) for 
the overall sequence to proceed. Therefore, 
steps with unfavorable standard affinity 
(A 
° < 0) must couple kinetically with pre- 
ceding steps in order to raise the fugacity of 
reactants to levels required for a positive 
affinity in the ith step. These conclusions 
are valid for any nonequilibrated (exergic) 
step in a steady-state reaction sequence, 
whether catalytic or not. 
3. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 
Catalysts were prepared by ball-milling 
elemental Te with NaX zeolite (Linde, 
13 x) for 4 h at room temperature. The 
initial Te content was 9-10 wt%. The cata- 
lyst was activated in flowing dihydrogen at 
773 K for 4-6 h before catalytic experi- 
ments. Te atoms not stabilized by interac- 
tions with cationic sites within zeolite 
channels sublimed during pretreatment. 
The Te content in the activated catalyst 
decreased to 4-5 wt% during the initial 
pretreatment 
but remained constant at 
these levels during subsequent catalytic 
experiments. 
Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts were prepared by 
ion exchange ofH-ZSM5 (Si/Al = 14.5) with 
an aqueous solution of Ga nitrate (32) at 353 
K. The catalyst (2.0 wt% Ga) was pretreated 
in H2 at 823 K for 6-8 h before catalytic 
experiments. 
Unlabeled hydrocarbons were obtained 
from commercial sources [methylcyclohex- 
ane (Fluka, 99.6%); n-heptane (Fluka pur- 
iss grade, >99%); heptenes (Aldrich, Gold 
Label, >99%); perdeuterated n-heptane 
(MSD Isotopes, >99%, 98.4% D); 3-meth- 
yl-l-cyclohexene (Fluka, >99%)]. n-Hep- 
tane labeled at one terminal carbon posi- 
tion (n-[l-~3C]heptane) was prepared by 
catalytic coupling of n-hexyl-magnesium 
bromide with [~3C]methyl iodide (4). Hy- 
drogen [Air Products; 99.995%] and deute- 
rium [Air Products; 99.5%] were purified 
using catalytic (Engelhard, 298 K) and mo- 
lecular sieve traps (Linde, 13x, 77 K). 
Propane (Air Products, Research Purity, 
>99.8%), propene (Air Products, Chemical 
Purity, >99.2%), and [2-J3C]propane (MSD 
552 
IGLESIA, BAUMGARTNER, AND PRICE 
Isotopes, >99.6% 13C) were obtained from 
commercial sources and used without fur- 
ther purification. 
Catalytic 
rates and selectivities were mea- 
sured in a gradientless recirculating batch 
reactor at reactant conversions less than 
25% (4). Products were analyzed by capil- 
lary column chromatography using flame 
ionization or electron-impact mass-spectro- 
metric detection. Deuterium distributions in 
reactants and products were determined us- 
ing mass spectrometry and a matrix calcula- 
tion technique reported recently (33). 
Reaction rates are reported as turnover 
rates [(moles reactant converted)/(g-atom 
surface site • s-l)]. Selectivity is reported 
on a carbon-atom basis as the percentage 
of converted reactant appearing as a given 
product. The slopes of turnover-time plots 
give turnover rates for conversion to a given 
product. Turnovers are defined as the moles 
of reactant (e.g., n-heptane) converted to a 
given product (e.g., toluene) per gram-atom 
surface sites in the reactor. Surface sites 
were assumed to be Te atoms in Te/NaX 
and AI atoms in H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5 
in the turnover calculations. 
4. n-HEPTANE DEHYDROGENATION/ 
DEHYDROCYCLIZATION ON Te/NaX 
Te/NaX catalysts convert n-heptane to 
toluene, isoheptanes, and C1-C 
6 hydrocar- 
bons. Typical product distributions are 
shown in Table 1. Dehydrocyclization and 
cracking activation energies are 215 and 230 
kJ/mol, respectively. Turnover rates are 
much lower than on Pt-based catalysts but 
dehydrocyclization selectivities are simi- 
lar (4). 
4.1. Catalytic Turnover Rates and 
Reaction Pathways 
Contact time plots for heptenes suggest 
that they are reactive intermediates in n- 
heptane dehydrocyclization and isomeriza- 
tion on Te/NaX (Fig. 1). The low initial 
slopes (turnover rates) and nonzero inter- 
cepts of toluene and methylhexane turn-

Figure 2 describes experimental heptene/ 
heptane ratios for 1-, cis-2-, and trans-2- 
heptenes; they approach a constant value 
after about 2 ks for all heptene isomers. The 
dashed lines show the equilibrium value ex- 
pected for each alkene isomer at reaction 
temperature and gas-phase dihydrogen 
pressure (96 kPa) (4, 34). Experimental and 
equilibrium heptene/heptane ratios differ 
significantly. The observed constant values 
of heptene/heptane ratio, therefore, appear 
to reflect nonequilibrated heptene concen- 
trations. The ratio of experimental (steady 
state) to equilibrium alkene to alkane ratios 
(X, Eq. (13)) is less than one and very similar 
for all heptenes (1-heptene, 0.66; cis-2-hep- 
tene, 0.64; trans-2-heptene 0.66, at 96-kPa 
dihydrogen pressure; Table 2). These data 
suggest that in the absence of hydrogen sur- 
face overpressures [Hz)g/(H2)ss = I], the ki- 
netic constant ratio (k2/k_l) would be 
0.5-0.6 and independent of the double-bond

rates are zero at all heptane pressures (Fig. 
3). Turnover rates increase as contact time 
increases; they reach steady-state values 
(reported in Fig. 3) after about 1-2 ks, the 
contact times required to achieve steady- 
state concentrations of heptene interme- 
diates. 
Steady-state dehydrocyclization turnover 
rates are inversely proportional to dihydro- 
gen pressure between 20 and 96 kPa (Fig. 
4a). Asymptotic alkene/alkane ratios in- 
crease only slightly as dihydrogen pressure 
decreases (Fig. 4b); they do not obey the 
inverse dependence expected for equili- 
brated dehydrogenation steps. Steady-state 
and equilibrium ratios for terminal and inter- 
nal heptene intermediates are shown in Ta- 
ble 2 at several dihydrogen pressures. Devi- 
ations from equilibrium (X) increase as 
dihydrogen pressure decreases; they are 
similar for all heptene isomers. These data 
suggest that the initial dehydrogenation step 
is nonequilibrated; the reaction sequence 
essentially consists of rate-determining se- 
quential 
dehydrogenation 
steps. 
Alter- 
nately, these data could reflect a surface 
hydrogen pool that remains nonequilibrated 
with gas-phase dihydrogen.

4.4. Dehydrocyclization Kinetic Isotope 
Effects in n-Heptane 
Dehydrocyclization and dehydrogenation 
turnovers for n-heptane (C7H16 in H2) and 
perdeuterated n-heptane (C7D16 in D2) re- 
actants are compared in Fig. 5. A large ki- 
netic isotope effect is observed; toluene 
turnover rates are 4.3 times lower (Fig. 5a) 
and asymptotic heptene/heptane ratios (Fig. 
5b) are 1.5 times lower for perdeuterated 
reactants. The observed dehydrocyclization 
kinetic isotope effects are greater than those 
expected from a single rate-determining de- 
hydrogenation step in an irreversible se- 
quence; thus, it is inconsistent with a totally 
irreversible reaction sequence, whose over- 
all rate equals the unidirectional forward 
rate of the initial dehydrogenation step. The 
kinetic isotope effect for the initial (irrevers- 
ible) n-heptane dehydrogenation to hep- 
tenes on Te/NaX is about 2.0, considerably 
lower than the value of 4.3 obtained for the 
overall catalytic sequence. The observed ef- 
fect of deuterium substitution on heptene/ 
heptane ratios (KIE = 1.5) is somewhat 
weaker than that for n-heptane reactions on 
Pt catalysts (1.7-1.9) (35); the latter reflects 
isotooic effects on the hydrogenation-dehy- 
drogenation equilibrium constant. Isotope 
effects on heptene/heptane ratios on Te/ 
NaX (-1.5) are unlikely to reflect only deu- 
terium effects on (k2/kl) ratios, which deter- 
mine heptene/heptane ratios for an irrevers- 
ible sequence (Eq. (12)). Such isotope 
effects should approach unity because of the 
similar expected kinetic isotope effects in 
the consecutive alkane and alkene dehydro- 
genation steps. 
Kinetic isotope effects on Te/NaX (4.3) 
are consistent with a sequence of surface- 
catalyzed dehydrogenation steps (7a)-(7c), 
(7e) where alkane/alkene adsorption, de- 
sorption, and interconversion are in quasi- 
equilibrium but where the overall reaction 
rate is limited by the hydrogen-desorption 
step that accompanies each dehydrogena- 
tion event; it must occur four times for the 
formation of a toluene molecule. The overall 
rate of such a reaction sequence is given by 
K4K5 KIKzK3 (C7H16) 
v - 
(H2)4s 
(14) 
If deuterium isotope effects measured for 
heptane dehydrogenation on Te/NaX (35) 
(-1.5) apply for subsequent dehydrogena- 
tion steps, and if the equilibrium constant 
for the thermal electrocyclic addition reac- 
tion of heptatrienes is unaffected by deute- 
rium substitution because it involves con- 
certed C-H 
bond-breaking 
and bond-

making steps, the calculated kinetic isotope 
effect for the overall sequence is 5.0, in qual- 
itative agreement with the observed value 
of 4.3. 
The rate-limiting recombinative desorp- 
teen of deuterium leads to large kinetic iso- 
tope effects because of the higher binding 
energy of deuterium atoms on most surfaces 
and because deuterium desorption must oc- 
cur four times in one dehydrocyclization 
turnover. 
4.5 Isotopic Tracer Studies of 1-Heptene 
Reaction Pathways 
The intermediate role of heptenes and 
their relative rates of hydrogenation (to hep- 
tane) and conversion to products were es- 
tablished by measuring the rate of appear- 
ance of unlabeled heptane and of unlabeled 
toluene, isoheptanes, and CI-C6 products 
from 
l-heptene 
(~25% 
mol) 
and 
n- 
[1J3C]heptane (~75% mol) reactant mix- 
tures. 
Figure 6 shows the ~3C content in n- 
heptane, heptenes, and toluene at dihydro- 
gen pressures of 20 kPa (Fig. 6a) and 96 
kPa (Fig. 6b). The 13C content in all hep- 
tenes is similar, suggesting that ]3C equili- 
bration occurs rapidly among heptene iso- 
mers. 
Isotopic 
equilibration 
between 
heptenes and n-heptane proceeds more 
slowly; isotopic contents become equal at 
contact times greater than about 2 ks, 
suggesting that isotopic, and therefore 
chemical, equilibration eventually occurs 
between heptane and heptenes. Toluene is 
preferentially formed from unlabeled hep- 
tenes, suggesting that alkene intermediates 
are required in dehydrocyclization reac- 
tions. The intermediate role of unsaturated 
species in dehydrocyclization is consistent 
with alkane cyclization via thermal electro- 
cyclic addition reactions of heptatriene in- 
termediates (4). Initial methylhexane and 
CI-C6 products are also unlabeled, sug- 
gesting that heptenes are also required 
intermediates in isomerization and cracking 
reactions. 
These results suggest that 13C isotopic 
equilibration occurs between n-heptane 
and 1-heptene at contact times similar to 
those required for attaining steady-state 
heptene/heptane ratios. Yet, these ratios 
are well below equilibrium values. 13C 
equilibration between n-heptane and hep- 
tenes occurs rapidly; yet, it must occur

experimental results provide only an upper 
limit for this ratio because rapid isotopic 
equilibration prevents direct measurements 
at low isotopic conversion, and the effect of 
reverse reactions (n-heptane dehydrogena- 
tion) is to decrease the net rate of 12C appear- 
ance in n-heptane. These ratios of rate con- 
stants (Eq. (8)) are 0.18 and 0.09 at 20- and 
96-kPa dihydrogen pressures, respectively 
(Table 3). These values are upper limits; yet, 
they are considerably smaller than those cal- 
culated from deviations of steady-state al- 
kene/alkane ratios from their equilibrium 
values (Table 2). 
These (k2/k_ 1) ratios measured from iso- 
topic exchange rates are small; they suggest 
that dehydrogenation-hydrogenation steps 
involving carbon atoms are quasi-equili- 
brated during steady-state dehydrocycliza- 
tion of n-heptane. For example, the ex- 
pected 1-heptene/n-heptane ratios (in the 
case of equilibrated 
hydrogen adsorp- 
tion-desorption) for these values of (k2/k_ 1) 
are 0.55 x 10 -2 and 2.51 x 10 -2 at 96- and 
20-kPa dihydrogen pressures, respectively; 
the corresponding experimental values are 
significantly lower (0.40 x 10 -2 and 0.58 x 
10-2), especially at low dihydrogen pres- 
sures. The marked differences between 
steady-state and equilibrium heptene/hep- 
tane ratios, their weak dependence on dihy- 
drogen pressure and the low (k2/k_ 1) values 
reported in this section suggest that isotopic 
carbon equilibration occurs rapidly during 
n-heptane reactions on Te/NaX but without 
concurrent equilibration between gas-phase 
and surface hydrogen species. In other 
words, desorption of hydrogen from the sur- 
face is a rate-determining (exergic) step that 
prevents complete equilibration between H 2 
and hydrogen adatoms produced in sequen- 
tial dehydrogenation steps. 
In effect, dehydrogenation elementary 
steps (8a)-(8d) divert some of the overall 
affinity change of the dehydrogenation se- 
quence into raising the chemical potential 
(fugacity) of hydrogen adatoms in order to 
overcome an unfavorable standard affinity 
(A 
°) in the hydrogen desorption step (8f). As 
a result, the rate of n-heptane dehydrogena- 
tion decreases. Hydrogen desorption limita- 
tions lead to high hydrogen surface fugacit- 
ies; 
dehydrocyclization 
rates 
decrease 
because the concentration of unsaturated 
reaction intermediates are limited to values 
in equilibrium with a high surface hydrogen 
fugacity rather than with the lower gas- 
phase dihydrogen pressure. 
4.6. n-Heptane-Deuterium Exchange 
The rate of isotopic exchange between 
gas-phase deuterium and n-heptane pro- 
vides an independent value of the ratio of 
alkene hydrogenation (Vn) to net alkene 
dehydrocyclization, 
isomerization, 
and 
cracking (vT). In effect, these data can 
show whether surface hydrogenation reac- 
tions use H-atoms cleaved from n-heptane 
reactants or D-adatoms equilibrated with 
gas-phase D 2. The distribution of deute- 
rium in unreacted n-heptane and in cis-2- 
heptene and toluene products of n-heptane/ 
D2 mixtures are shown in Fig. 8 at several 
contact times and 20- and 96-kPa D2. At 
short contact times, the gas phase, and 
any adsorbed species in equilibrium with 
it, contain no protium species, n-Heptane- 
d~ and -d2 species are the most abundant 
deuterated species at short contact times; 
they reflect the weak contribution of gas- 
phase deuterium to the surface hydrogen 
pool and to the hydrogenation (vH) of olefin 
intermediates. 
More highly deuterated n-heptane, with a 
binomial deuterium distribution centered at 
about ds-d6, is formed by hydrogenation of 
intermediate olefins that previously under- 
went secondary deuterium-exchange reac- 
tions; these reactions occur rapidly on cat- 
ionic sites within NaX zeolites during 
double-bond isomerization of intermediate 
olefins (36). They result in toluene and olefin 
deuterium contents significantly higher than

those in unreacted n-heptane. The similar 
binomial shape of the d3-d14 deuterium dis- 
tributions in heptenes and heptanes suggest 
that deuteration or hydrogenation of exten- 
sively exchanged heptenes accounts for 
multiply-exchanged n-heptane. The marked 
differences in do-d2 distribution and in total 
deuterium content between heptane and 
heptenes, however, demonstrate the lack of 
H-D isotopic exchange between heptenes 
and heptane in contact times that suffice for 
13C isotopic equilibration. The low deute- 
rium content (<3% D) in "unreacted" n- 
heptane at these short contact times (-2 ks) 
suggests that heptene hydrogenation steps 
use predominantly protium (from n-hep- 
tane) rather than deuterium adatoms (from 
gas-phase O2). 
The presence of deuterium atoms in n- 
heptane reactants suggests a partially re- 
versible 
dehydrogenation-hydrogenation 
sequence:

Steady-state n-heptane turnover rates are 
given by the rate of appearance of toluene 
and methylhexane products (cracking selec- 
tivities are less than 15%) that require olefin 
intermediates (4). The ratio of the rate of 
deuterium incorporation into heptane (the 
exchange rate, VD), which occurs during re- 
versible 
dehydrogenation-hydrogenation 
steps, to the heptane conversion rate gives 
the fraction of the reactive surface hydrogen 
pool that consists of deuterium (from D2). 
Thus, we obtain a direct measurement of the 
hydrogen surface fugacity. These calcula- 
tions assume that H-D kinetic isotope ef- 
fects in CvHI6/D 
2 
mixtures are small; experi- 
mental isotope effects for dehydrogenation 
of C7HI6/D2 mixtures are less than 1.2. 
Deuterium incorporation into n-heptane 
occurs in at least two ways: (a) by a revers- 
ible dehydrogenation-hydrogenation reac- 
tion event without intermediate deuterium 
exchange into reactive heptenes (leading to 
n-heptane-d2 if the surface is equilibrated 
with gas-phase D2), or (b) by a similar re- 
versible step, but after fast exchange of in- 
termediate heptenes with deuterium (lead- 
ing to n-heptane-(d3-dl6)), n-Heptane-d l 
products must arise from similar pathways 
on a surface containing both H- and D-atoms 
or from an incomplete traversal of the re- 
versible 
dehydrogenation-hydrogenation 
step (Eq. (19)). Thus, we calculate turnover 
rates for exchange (i.e., hydrogenation us- 
ing the gas-phase source of hydrogen) from 
the rate of formation of n-heptane molecules 
containing one or more deuterium atoms. 
Deuterated n-heptane turnovers (Fig. 9) are 
calculated from the number of dl (multiplied 
by 0.5 to account for its acquiring only one 
deuterium in the hydrogenation step) and 
d2+ n-heptane molecules in the product. 
We consider every n-heptane molecule 
containing one or more deuterium atoms to 
have made one reactive sojourn on a surface 
containing only D* and thus instantaneously 
and completely equilibrated with gas-phase 
D2. The rate of heptane deuteration is then 
given by the slope of the deuteration turn- 
over-contact time plots shown in Fig. 9. The 
steady-state conversion rate of heptenes to 
products (vT) is given by the accompanying 
total turnover-contact time plot (Fig. 9). 
The (v~/vD) ratios obtained from deute- 
rium exchange data are considerably larger 
than (vT/vn) ratios obtained from ~3C isoto- 
pic tracer studies (e.g., 0.90 vs 0.18 at 20 
kPa; 0.26 vs 0.09 at 96 kPa gas-phase pres- 
sures) (Table 4). The 13C tracer experiments 
give a kinetic ratio for a hydrogenation event 
(19) 
that reacts with the entire hydrogen surface 
pool, whether equilibrated with gas-phase 
hydrogen species or not. Deuterium ex- 
change rates, however, measure only those

provides an estimate of the fraction of the 
surface pool that consists of D* and is there- 
fore equilibrated with gas-phase deuterium. 
These fractions are 0.20 and 0.34 at 20 and 
96 kPa deuterium, respectively (Table 4). 
These values agree well with the observed 
fraction of deuterium in toluene (0.18 and 
0.33); toluene molecules exchange rapidly 
with surface hydrogen species and thus sam- 
ple the composition of the hydrogen surface 
pool on Te/NaX (Table 4). 
These data show that the hydrogen sur- 
face fugacity is 1.4 times greater than gas- 
phase pressures at 96 kPa and 4.8 times 
greater at 20 kPa during n-heptane reactions 
on Te/NaX (Table 4). Surface fugacity val- 
ues determine surface reaction rates; the ki- 
netic behavior of this surface is identical to 
that observed on surfaces actually equili- 
brated with similar gas-phase dihydrogen 
fugacities.

4.7. I-Heptene Deuteration Rates 
The initial deuterium content in n-heptane 
formed during dehydrocyclization of C7HI4 
/ 
Dz (Fig. 10) or C7HI4/C7DI6/D2 mixtures 
(Fig. 11) is very low, also suggesting that 
high hydrogen surface fugacities exist dur- 
ing alkene dehydrogenation reactions on 
Te/NaX. 1-Heptene undergoes dehydroge- 
nation and dehydrocyclization reactions 
that release hydrogen (H*) onto the surface 
and hydrogenation, which consumes H* and 
any D* equilibrated with D 
2. 1-Heptene re- 
acts much more rapidly than n-heptane; 
therefore, surface hydrogen fugacities arise 
mostly from C7H14 dehydrogenation rather 
than from C7D16 reactions in CvHI4/C7DI6/ 
D 2 mixtures, n-Heptane-d2 is the expected 
initial product of 1-heptene hydrogenation 
if only D* is present at the surface (i.e., 
equilibrated hydrogen adsorption-desorp- 
tion); n-heptane-d0 forms only if surface hy- 
drogen fugacities significantly exceed gas- 
phase D2 pressures. 
The most abundant initial product of 1- 
heptene reactions in D 
2 (Fig. 10) or C7D16/ 
D2 (Fig. 11) mixtures on Te/NaX catalysts 
pretreated with H 2 (but subsequently ex- 
changed with Dz at reaction conditions for 
0.6 ks before reaction) is n-heptane-d0. The 
initial n-heptane product (0.3 ks, Fig. 10) 
from C7HI4/D2 mixtures contains 78% do, 
19% d 1, and 3% d2. This distribution sug- 
gests that "deuteration" occurs on a surface 
containing about 85% H* and 15% D* (pre- 
dicted binomial distribution: 72% do, 24%

dl, 2% d2). Such surfaces behave as if they 
were equilibrated with a gas-phase con- 
taining about 5.7 times more H 2 than D2, 
rather than pure deuterium. Therefore, sur- 
face fugacities of hydrogen and deuterium 
are 114 and 20 kPa, respectively. 
These deuteration studies confirm that 
hydrogen adsorption-desorption steps are 
not equilibrated during heptane and hep- 
tene dehydrogenation and dehydrocycliza- 
tion reactions on Te/NaX. Hydrogen ada- 
toms 
placed 
on 
surface 
sites 
by 
dehydrogenation steps are unable to equili- 
brate with corresponding gas-phase hydro- 
gen species; their net removal from the 
surface as H2 limits the overall rate of the 
catalytic sequence. 
5. METHYLCYLOHEXANE 
DEHYDROGENATION ON Te/NaX 
Cycloalkane dehydrogenation also in- 
volves the release of hydrogen adatoms onto 
surface sites, from which they must desorb 
for sites to "turnover." Methylcyclohexane 
dehydrogenates to intermediate methyl- 
cyclohexene and 
methylcyclohexadiene 
isomers and to stable toluene products on 
Te/NaX (Fig. 12a). The reaction proceeds 
without establishing 3-methyl-l-cyclohex- 
ene/methylcyclohexane equilibrium ratios 
(4.8 x 10 -4, steady state; 9.0 x 10 -4 equi- 
librium) and without extensive exchange be-

l-hexene (-20% mol) and [1-13C]methyl

Isotopic ~3C equilibration between methyl- 
cyclohexane and methylcyclohexene oc- 
curs in about 2 ks (Fig. 12b), a time scale 
similar to that required for attaining steady- 
state methylcyclohexene concentrations 
(Fig. 12a). Measurements of unlabeled 
methylcyclohexane and unlabeled toluene 
turnovers allow us to obtain the ratio of 
methylcyclohexene hydrogenation (v-22) 
rate to that of its conversion to toluene prod- 
ucts ('023). The initial value of this ratio (1)_22/ 
v23) is about 1.5 (Table 5). 
The rate of deuterium incorporation into 
methylcyclohexane in the presence of D 2 is 
similar to the toluene formation rate (Fig. 
12a). Their ratio (v22/v23) is about 0.9 (Table 
5). This value is lower than that obtained 
from 13C isotopic tracer studies (1.5), sug- 
gesting that steady-state methylcyclohex- 
ane hydrogenation occurs on a surface con- 
taining about 60% D* and 40% H*. Thus, 
hydrogen adsorption-desorption is not 
equilibrated and recombinative desorption 
of hydrogen adatoms limits the rate of meth- 
ylcyclohexane conversion to toluene. The 
surface hydrogen fugacity generated by de- 
hydrogenation steps is about 65 kPa, while 
the corresponding deuterium surface fugac- 
ity equals its gas-phase pressure (96 kPa). 
Thus, the total surface hydrogen pressure is 
about 160 kPa (Table 5), in excellent

Propane reactions lead to products rang- 
ing from methane to C12 aromatics on H- 
ZSM5 (Table 6). The selectivity to C6+ aro- 
matics is low and the hydrogen adatoms 
formed in dehydrogenation steps are re- 
moved from the surface predominantly by 
reaction with adsorbed hydrocarbon frag- 
ments, leading to methane and ethane; hy-

drogen adatoms seldom desorb as dihydro- 
gen, 
suggesting 
that 
recombinative 
desorption is slow on H-ZSM5. 
Isotopic 
tracer 
studies 
of propene/ 
[2-13C]propane mixtures show that dehydro- 
cyclodimerization occurs via alkene inter- 
mediates on H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5. A1- 
kenes enter oligomerization/cracking cycles 
that lead to the many skeletal isomerization 
events during one surface turnover; many 
C-C and C-H bonds are broken and re- 
formed in one surface turnover. As a result, 
all products of [2J3C]propane reactions on 
H-ZSM5 contain statistical numbers of ~3C 
atoms (Fig. 14). For example, benzene mol- 
ecules with zero to five ~3C atoms are de- 
tected in the products of [2-13C]propane re- 
actions (Fig. 14a). Their relative isotopomer 
abundance obeys a binomial distribution, 
suggesting that the propane backbone is to- 
tally and randomly rearranged during re- 
action. 
Every C-C and C-H bond in propane or 
propene reactants is broken and reformed 
several times during the formation of one 
product molecule. Thus, product molecules 
accurately sample the composition of the 
surface hydrogen pool; the deuterium con- 
tent in the products of CsHs/D2 reactants 
reflects the relative surface protium and 
deuterium fugacities and the extent to which 
hydrogen 
adsorption-desorption 
steps 
equilibrate during propane conversion. On 
H-ZSM5, deuterium contents are similar for 
all products (Fig. 15), suggesting that all 
products equilibrate with the same hydro- 
gen surface fugacity. The deuterium content 
is low (2-4%); therefore, the surface hydro- 
gen pool consists almost entirely of protium 
adatoms formed from reacting propane mol- 
ecules rather than deuterium adatoms from 
gas-phase D2. The deuterium surface fugac- 
ity equals its gas-phase value (6.6 kPa) be- 
cause deuterium is not formed or consumed 
at significant rates during C3H8 conversion. 
The protium surface fugacity is 25-50 times 
greater than the deuterium pressure and 
leads to the measured 2-4% D in reaction 
products; the protium surface fugacity 
equals 165-330 kPa at reaction conditions.

2 reactions on H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5 (773 K, 
26.6 kPa C3H 
8, 6.6 kPa D2, <15% propane conversion). (a) H-ZSM5. (b) 2.1 wt% Ga/H-ZSM5. 
The presence of Ga ions (2.1 wt%) at ex- 
change sites within zeolite channels in- 
creases propane conversion rate and C6+ 
aromatics selectivity and yield (Table 6). Ga 
selectively increases the rate of propane and 
propene dehydrogenation steps and leads to 
the appearance ofdihydrogen as a gas-phase 
product. We propose that Ga ions ex- 
changed onto cationic sites in ZSM5 act as 
"portholes" (37) for the recombinative de- 
sorption of hydrogen adatoms; in this man- 
ner, Ga ions lower hydrogen surface fugacit- 
ies at catalytic sites on H-ZSM5. In the 
presence of Ga, cracking reactions are no 
longer required for removing all hydrogen 
adatoms formed in dehydrogenation steps. 
Aromatics can be formed without concur- 
rent cracking events and the C6÷ aromatics 
selectivity increases (43.1% vs 10.6%, Table 
6). 
Ga ions increase the deuterium content 
in propane reaction products (Fig. 15); all 
products initially contain about 25% D, a 
value much higher than that on H-ZSM5 
(2-4% D). The deuterium content in the 
products decreases as contact time in- 
creases (Fig. 15) because gas-phase D: is 
diluted by the H 2 product formed in C3H 
8 
reactions. Products are formed on catalytic 
sites that contain about 25% D-atoms (from 
gas-phase D2) and 75% H-atoms (from re- 
acting propane molecules). Again, the sur- 
face deuterium fugacity equals its gas-phase 
value (6.6 kPa) and protium virtual pres- 
sures are about three times greater (20 kPa). 
Thus, the total hydrogen surface fugacity is 
much lower on Ga/H-ZSM5 (26.6 kPa) than 
on H-ZSM5 (165-330 kPa); however, gas- 
phase and surface hydrogen pools remain 
nonequilibrated and modest protium surface 
fugacities remain during propane conver- 
sion on H-ZSM5 even in the presence of Ga 
ions. 
Recombinative desorption of hydrogen 
adatoms limits propane conversion rates 
and aromatics selectivity on H-ZSM5. De- 
hydrogenation rates and steady-state con- 
centrations of unsaturated intermediates are 
decreased by high surface hydrogen fugacit- 
ies that also lead to hydrocracking as the 
predominant hydrogen removal pathway. 
We propose that Ga ions partially relieve 
these hydrogen overpressures by catalyzing 
the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms

during propane conversion. This porthole 
effect probably accounts also for similar ef- 
fects of Pt and Zn on the rate and selectivity 
of propane conversion on H-ZSM5 (18-25, 
38, 39). The earliest evidence for hydrogen 
desorption portholes was reported by H. S. 
Taylor in 1961 (37): Pt surfaces catalyzed 
the desorption of hydrogen adatoms during 
the decomposition ofGeH 
2 
to Ge metal. Un- 
doubtedly, hydrogen desorption portholes 
also play a crucial role in controlling hydro- 
gen transfer reactions (35) that occur in cata- 
lytic cracking processes. 
The enhancing effect of Pt, Ga, and Zn 
species on propane dehydrocyclodimeriza- 
tion rates and aromatics selectivity on 
HZSM-5 (21-25, 38, 39) is consistent with 
reaction rates limited by hydrogen desorp- 
tion. Metals and low-valent metal ions such 
as Ga +8 enhance dehydrogenation rates of 
alkanes, alkenes, and cycloalkanes on zeo- 
litic and nonzeolitic metal oxides (38-40) 
and on active carbon (41) by increasing the 
rate of alkane dehydrogenation (39) and of 
hydrogen removal as H 2 (38, 40, 41) during 
alkane reactions. We suggest that an acid 
functionality (such as HZSM-5 or SiOJ 
A1203) can carry out stoichiometric paraffin 
dehydrogenation and olefin dimerization 
and cyclization reactions. Yet, sites cannot 
turnover without hydrogen desorption sites 
(e.g., Ni, Cu, Zn +~ (38), Ga +~ (40), noble 
metals (41), metal chromites, or mixtures 
thereof) that provide an efficient porthole 
for the removal of the hydrogen adatoms 
formed in dehydrogenation steps. 
Our work shows conclusively that Ga +8 
ions enhance the interaction between gas- 
phase and surface hydrogen pools by in- 
creasing the rate of hydrogen adsorp- 
tion-desorption. However, complete equili- 
bration does not occur even at high Ga 
loadings (2.0 wt%) and hydrogen removal 
remains one of the rate-limiting steps even 
on Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts. 
Recombinative desorption of hydrogen 
adatoms from metal oxides and nonmetals 
occurs by heterolytic recombination of H + 
and H- species. Most previous studies have 
addressed the reverse step: the heterolytic 
dissociation of H2 on such surfaces (42, 43). 
Heterolytic dissociation of H 2 leads to the 
formation of protons stabilized by the metal 
cation and hydride species associated with 
the oxygen anions (42): 
H2(g) + M +80s-2 
H-M +~ + H + - O~ 
-2. 
(25) 
A subsequent redox process 
H- M +~ + M +~ O~ 
-2 ~--- 
2M+~8-1)Os 2 H + 
(26) 
can lead to the formation of additional pro- 
tons and to the partial reduction of a neigh- 
boring metal cation (43). This latter process 
occurs only on oxides of metals with multi- 
ple valence states. 
We propose that recombinative desorp- 
tion of hydrogen adatoms occurs on Te/NaX 
and Ga/H-ZSM5 by the reverse of Eq. (25), 
H- 
1÷.21 
(27) 
perhaps with a slight decrease in the metal 
oxidation state (Eq. (27)) in order to de- 
crease the net negative charge of the hydride 
ion. Thus, Ga and Te ions act as Lewis acids 
that stabilize the negative charge in H- spe- 
cies. In the absence of such low-valent ions, 
zeolites momentarily stabilize hydride ions 
by adsorption on AI atom sites that lack 
neighboring protonated O- sites. These un- 
stable hydride species are likely to recom- 
bine with the hydrocarbon that formed them 
or with neighboring hydrocarbon fragments

7. CONCLUSIONS 
We have provided experimental evidence 
for the rate-determining role of hydrogen 
desorption steps and for the presence of hy- 
drogen surface fugacities that exceed gas- 
phase hydrogen pressures during n-heptane 
dehydrocyclization and methylcyclohexane 
dehydrogenation on Te/NaX and during 
propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H- 
ZSM5 and GaJH-ZSM5. Hydrogen desorp- 
tion limits the rate of the intermediate dehy- 
drogenation steps required in these alkane 
reactions. High surface hydrogen fugacities 
decrease the concentration of unsaturated 
intermediates by limiting them to values in 
equilibrium with surface hydrogen fugacit- 
ies that significantly exceed gas-phase dihy- 
drogen pressures. 
Hydrogen desorption rates can be in- 
creased by metal ions such as Te +~, Ga +~, 
and others; they act as catalysts for the rate- 
determining hydrogen desorption steps. Hy- 
drogen removal rates can also be increased 
by surface reactions that attach it to a sur- 
face hydrocarbon fragment (hydrocracking) 
or to an unsaturated adsorbed molecule (hy- 
drogenation). Thus, alkanes can be used as 
effective hydrogen sources for desired hy- 
drogenation and hydrocracking reactions; in 
this manner, we can benefit from high hy- 
drogen surface fugacities that would other- 
wise limit the rate of alkane dehydrogena- 
tion reactions.
