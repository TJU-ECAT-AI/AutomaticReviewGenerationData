Abstract
Synthetic methods are reported to prepare chabazite (CHA) zeolites (SSZ-13) at fixed elemental composition but with different arrangements of their framework Al atoms (Al–O(−Si–O)x–Al) between paired (x = 1, 2) and isolated (x ≥ 3) configurations. SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 15–30) that crystallized in hydroxide media and in the presence of only N,N,N-trimethyl-1-admantylammonium cations (TMAda+) contained only isolated framework Al, evident in their inability to exchange divalent Cu2+ or Co2+ cations that titrate paired Al sites. Addition of Na+ to the zeolite crystallization medium, with total cationic charge ((Na+ + TMAda+)/Al) and other synthesis parameters held constant, crystallized SSZ-13 zeolites at a fixed Si/Al ratio but with paired Al densities that increased linearly with the Na+ content incorporated into the crystalline solids. Crystallization media containing equimolar amounts of Na+ and TMAda+, but varying Al content, crystallized SSZ-13 at different compositions (Si/Al = 5, 15, 25) with the paired Al density expected if Al atoms were distributed randomly subject to Löwenstein’s rule. The relative ratio of organic (TMAda+) and inorganic (Na+) cations in the crystallization medium, which determines its cationic charge density, systematically influences the arrangement of isolated and paired Al, which determines the anionic charge density in the zeolite framework. The synthetic strategy of using mixtures of organic and inorganic structure-directing agents extends concepts of charge density mismatch in zeolite crystallization, which have been exploited previously to discover routes to new framework topologies and compositions, to systematically control the atomic arrangement in a given zeolite at fixed composition and, in doing so, provide new methods to introduce structural and catalytic diversity.

1 Introduction
Brønsted acidic zeolites are silica-based molecular sieve frameworks that contain a fraction of their silicon atoms substituted with aluminum atoms, which generate anionic charges balanced by protons that differ in the local micropore environment among known zeolite topologies and in density with changes in bulk elemental composition (Si/Al ratio). Even a given zeolite at fixed composition, however, contains structural and catalytic diversity conferred by the arrangement and distribution of its framework Al atoms. One type of Al arrangement describes the location of Al atoms among different pores of a given zeolite, as in the case of ferrierite (FER) zeolites (Si/Al = 10–20) that can be synthesized with mixtures of organic structure directing agents (SDAs) that differ in size and direct the siting of framework Al atoms in either 8-membered ring (8-MR) or 10-MR locations. (1-3) Similarly, MFI zeolites synthesized in the presence of only tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) cations contain higher fractions of Al atoms located in 10-MR channel intersections, within which TPA+ cations remain occluded in crystalline products, than MFI zeolites synthesized with mixtures of organic TPA+ and inorganic alkali (Na+) cations, which reside within straight and sinusoidal 10-MR channels. (4) The distribution of Al among different voids of a given zeolite influences catalytic reactivity, in spite of the similar acid strength of attendant protons, (5) because reactive intermediates and transition states stabilized at such protons interact with surrounding oxide cavities by van der Waals forces whose strength depends on the geometry of the confining environment. (6-8) This Al distribution also influences the structural stability of a given zeolite, as in the case of BEA zeolites whose Al atoms in different tetrahedral sites (T-sites), quantified by fitting Al K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) and 27Al MAS NMR spectra to those derived from DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations, showed different susceptibility to steam dealumination after hot liquid water treatments (433–573 K, 24 h). (9-11)
Another type of Al arrangement describes the proximity of Al atoms within the framework, ranging from the limit of Al site isolation (Al–O(−Si−O)x–Al, x ≥ 3) to higher densities of proximal or “paired” Al atoms, which are defined here as two Al atoms separated by either one or two Si atoms in a 6-MR (Al–O(−Si–O)x–Al, x = 1, 2; Scheme 1) because both configurations in chabazite (CHA) zeolites exchange divalent cations with similar energies (within 20 kJ/mol for Cu2+ according to DFT). (12, 13) Steam dealumination of faujasite (FAU) zeolites preferentially removes Al atoms in next-nearest neighbor configurations, identified by Q2 sites ((Si–O)2–Si–(O–Al)2: δ = −95 ppm) in 29Si MAS NMR spectra, to form “ultra-stable” Y (USY) zeolites that contain predominantly isolated Al atoms that are less susceptible to further structural changes. (14-16) Isolated Al atoms among different T-sites and zeolite topologies in periodic DFT models generate protons of equivalent ensemble-averaged deprotonation energy (DPE), (5) a rigorous and probe-independent measure of Brønsted acid strength that influences reactivity in acid catalysis, (17-20) while paired Al atoms generate weaker protons with higher DPE values (by 11–108 kJ mol–1) according to quantum chemical calculations on embedded cluster models. (21) Higher fractions of isolated Al atoms in CHA zeolites, achieved by increasing the bulk Si/Al ratio from 2 to 70, correlate with longer time-on-stream stabilities and lesser amounts of coke formed during methanol-to-olefins (MTO) catalysis (548–673 K). (22, 23) These findings indicate that synthetic methods that control the isolation and pairing of framework Al atoms in zeolites would provide new opportunities to introduce structural and catalytic diversity in a given zeolite at fixed composition.

The collective work of Dedecek and co-workers has provided evidence that different procedures used to synthesize MFI and other zeolites lead to different fractions of paired Al atoms, quantified by Co2+ titration, and has concluded that Al siting in zeolites is not determined randomly but also is not controlled by simple rules. (24) MFI zeolites synthesized with TPA+ cations as the organic SDA and different Al sources (AlCl3, Al(NO3)3, Al2O3, Al-tri-sec-butoxide) contained similar Si/Al ratios (28–29) but varying fractions of paired Al (0.07–0.33), while MFI zeolites synthesized with Al(OH)3 or metallic Al sources contained higher fractions of paired Al (>0.50) but also higher Si/Al ratios (34–60). (25) In contrast, MFI zeolites synthesized with only TPA+ and different Si sources (tetraethoxy orthosilicate, fumed silica, colloidal silica, sodium silicate) contained similar paired Al fractions (0.06–0.12) and similar Si/Al ratios (23–25). (26) The addition of Na+ (via NaCl) to TPA+-containing synthesis gels crystallized MFI zeolites (Si/Al = 22) with lower paired Al fractions (0.15) than those crystallized with TPA+ alone (0.40), but only to a point, beyond which increasing Na+ concentrations did not influence the crystalline products formed. (27) The use of Na sources with different counteranions (OH–, Cl–, PO43–; fixed Na/Al = 3.3) crystallized MFI zeolites (Si/Al = 21–29) with paired Al fractions that varied with counteranion identity (0.06, 0.14, 0.24, respectively) and were invariant with Na+ content (Na/Al = 3.3–9.9) when Cl– and PO43– were present (0.14–0.18 and 0.22–0.26, respectively), but increased with Na+ content (0.06–0.58) when OH– was present. (25) Taken together, these findings suggest that the isolated and paired Al distribution in MFI zeolites can sometimes be influenced by changing the concentrations and identities of certain reactant precursors, but without predictable or systematic trends with a single synthesis parameter and, in certain cases, also with changes to zeolite bulk composition (Si/Al = 20–60).
Here, we focus on the synthesis of CHA zeolites (SSZ-13), (28) which are used commercially in their H-form to catalyze MTO (29, 30) and after Cu- or Fe-exchange to catalyze NOx (x = 1, 2) selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with ammonia in mobile-source pollution abatement. (31, 32) CHA zeolites contain one unique T-site and double 6-membered ring (6-MR) building units that interconnect to form 8-MR windows (0.38 nm diam.), which limit transport into larger cages (0.82 nm diam., 18 T atoms per cage). They are commonly synthesized in the presence of N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantylammonium cations (TMAda+), which become occluded within CHA cages during crystallization, (33) although other organic SDAs (tetraethylammonium hydroxide, benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide) have also been reported. (34-36) Methods to synthesize low-silica SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al < 7) involve using low-silica FAU zeolites (Si/Al < 5) as the Al source in the presence of TMAda+, (33) or using amorphous aluminosilicate (37) and FAU precursors (38) in organic-free media. Methods to synthesize high-silica SSZ-13 zeolites of varying Si/Al ratio (Si/Al > 10) involve preparing precursor solutions in hydroxide media with equimolar amounts of Na+ and TMAda+ cations with varying Al content, (23, 28, 39) or in fluoride media using only TMAda+. (40) Mechanistic insights and conclusions regarding the consequences of synthesis methods on the siting of Al atoms in CHA zeolites have not been made previously, but different preparation routes are expected to influence the Al distribution as has been previously suggested for CHA zeolites (41) and demonstrated for MFI zeolites. (25-27)
Here, we report methods for the systematic control of Al isolation in SSZ-13 zeolites, at constant Si/Al ratio, by systematically changing the Na+/TMAda+ ratio in the synthesis solution. We provide evidence that SSZ-13 crystallized in hydroxide media with only TMAda+ cations contain exclusively isolated framework Al atoms, and that the number of paired Al atoms increases linearly with the number of Na+ cations retained within final crystalline products. During these syntheses, the total hydroxide concentration (OH–/Al), Si/Al ratio, total cationic charge ((Na++TMAda+)/Al), total water content, reagent precursor sources, and synthesis conditions are held constant. This carefully regulated and systematic synthesis approach enables us to isolate the consequences of using organic and inorganic SDA mixtures on the formation of paired Al atoms in SSZ-13 at fixed Si/Al ratio and to identify a clear, predictive, and single-valued synthesis–structure relation between the fraction of paired Al in SSZ-13 zeolites and the Na+/TMAda+ ratio in the hydroxide media used to crystallize them.
2 Experimental Methods
2.1 Synthesis of SSZ-13 Zeolites
High-aluminum Na-SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 5) were synthesized using a recipe adapted from the procedure described by Fickel et al., (42) which is a modified version of the original synthesis reported by Zones (33) and can be found in Section S.1 of the Supporting Information. SSZ-13 zeolites of Si/Al = 15 and 25 were synthesized following an adapted procedure described by Deka et al., (39) which is a modified version of the original synthesis reported by Zones (28) and can be found in Section S.2 of the Supporting Information. Pure-silica chabazite was synthesized following the procedure reported by Díaz-Cabañas et al. (43) and is described in Section S.3 of the Supporting Information.
Synthesis of Na+-free SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 60) was attempted in hydroxide media from precursor solutions containing molar ratios of 1 SiO2/X Al2O3/0.5 TMAdaOH/44 H2O, where X was varied between 0.067 and 0.20 (full synthesis procedures in Section S.4, Supporting Information). In a typical synthesis experiment, aqueous 1 M TMAdaOH solution (25 wt % Sachem) was added to deionized water (18.2 MΩ) in a perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) container (Savillex Corp.) and stirred for 15 min under ambient conditions. Next, Al(OH)3 (98 wt %, SPI Pharma) was added to the TMAdaOH solution, and the mixture was homogenized for 15 min under ambient conditions. Then, colloidal silica (Ludox HS40, 40 wt %, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the mixture and the contents were stirred for 2 h at ambient conditions until a homogeneous solution was obtained. The synthesis solution was then transferred to a 45 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (Parr Instruments) and heated in a forced convection oven (Yamato DKN-402C) at 433 K and rotated at 40 rpm for 6 days.
SSZ-13 zeolites were synthesized in hydroxide media from precursor solutions that contained a constant Na+/TMAda+ ratio of 0.67 but with varying Si/Al ratios (10–200), in which precursor solutions contained molar ratios of 1 SiO2/X Al2O3/0.3 TMAdaOH/0.2 NaOH/44 H2O (full synthesis procedures in Section S.5, Supporting Information). SSZ-13 zeolites were synthesized at Si/Al ratios of 15 and 25 with varying charge density (Na+/TMAda+ = 0–3), but with constant total charge ((Na++TMAda+)/Al = 7.5), in which precursor solutions contained molar ratios of 1 SiO2/Y Al2O3/X TMAdaOH/(0.5 – X) NaOH/44 H2O (full synthesis procedures in Section S.6, Supporting Information). SSZ-13 zeolites were synthesized at a solution Si/Al ratio of 15 with varying charge density (Na+/TMAda+ = 0–5.6) and varying total cationic charge ((Na+ + TMAda+)/Al = 5.4–7.1) (full synthesis procedures in Section S.7, Supporting Information). The preparation and crystallization procedures for Na+-containing zeolites occurred as described for Na+-free zeolites, in which the Al addition and homogenization step was followed by addition of Na+ via a 5 M sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH: 16.7 wt % NaOH in deionized water; NaOH 98 wt % Alfa Aesar) and homogenization for 15 min under ambient conditions.
2.2 Preparation of H-Form and Partially Cation-Exchanged Zeolites
Solids were recovered from autoclaves after their allotted crystallization time and washed thoroughly with deionized water (18.2 MΩ) and acetone (99.9 wt %, Sigma-Aldrich) in alternating steps (70 cm3 solvent per g solids) until the pH of the supernatant remained constant between washes, followed by a final water wash to remove residual acetone. Solids then were recovered via centrifugation, dried at 373 K under stagnant air for 24 h, and then treated in flowing dry air (1.67 cm3 s–1 gcat–1, 99.999% UHP, Indiana Oxygen) at 853 K (0.0167 K s–1) for 10 h. The residual Na+ content was removed by converting to the NH4-form via aqueous phase ion-exchange using 150 cm3 of a 1.0 M NH4NO3 solution (8.0 wt % in H2O; 99.9 wt %, Sigma-Aldrich) per g solids for 24 h at ambient conditions, followed by washing the solids four times with deionized water (70 cm3 per g solids). NH4-form zeolites were recovered using centrifugation, dried at 373 K under stagnant air for 24 h, and then converted to their H-form by treatment in flowing dry air (1.67 cm3 s–1 gcat–1, 99.999% UHP, Indiana Oxygen) at 773 K (0.0167 K s–1) for 4 h.
H-SSZ-13 zeolites were converted to their Cu2+ form by ion-exchange using aqueous Cu(NO3)2 solutions with molarities ranging between 0.001 M and 0.25 M (0.02–3.75 wt % Cu(NO3)2; 99 wt %, Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h at ambient conditions under stirring. The pH of the exchange solution was controlled to 5 through dropwise addition of 0.1 M NH4OH (pH ∼ 11; Sigma-Aldrich). After Cu2+ exchange, samples were washed four times with deionized water until the pH was constant between washes, recovered via centrifugation, and then dried at 373 K under stagnant air for 24 h. Cu-zeolites were then treated in flowing dry air (1.67 cm3 s–1 gcat–1, 99.999% UHP, Indiana Oxygen) at 773 K (0.0167 K s–1) for 4 h.
H-SSZ-13 zeolites were converted to their Co2+ form by an aqueous ion-exchange using 150 cm3 of a 0.25 M Co(NO3)2 (4.6 wt % Co(NO3)2; 99 wt %, Sigma-Aldrich) solution per g zeolite for 4 h at ambient conditions under stirring. The pH of the exchange solution was not controlled and reached a final value of ∼3.3 after 4 h. After the exchange the samples were washed four times with deionized water (70 cm3 per g solids), recovered using centrifugation, and dried at 373 K under stagnant air for 24 h. Co-SSZ-13 materials were then treated in flowing dry air (1.67 cm3 s–1 gcat–1, 99.999% UHP, Indiana Oxygen) at 773 K (0.0167 K s–1) for 4 h. A subsequent Co2+ ion exchange was performed using a 0.5 M Co(NO3)2 solution (9.2 wt % Co(NO3)2) to verify that each sample was saturated with Co2+ after exchanges performed with 0.25 M solutions.
H-SSZ-13 zeolites were converted to their Na+ form using 150 cm3 of an aqueous NaCl (99 wt %, Sigma-Aldrich) solution per g zeolite with molarities ranging from 0.01 M-2.0 M (0.06–11.7 wt % NaCl in deionized water) for 24 h at ambient conditions. The pH of the Na+ exchanges was not controlled and reached a final value of ∼3.2 after 24 h. Na+ exchanged samples were washed four times with deionized water (70 cm3 per g solids), recovered using centrifugation, and dried at 373 K under stagnant air for 24 h. Na-SSZ-13 materials were then treated in flowing dry air (1.67 cm3 s–1 gcat–1, 99.999% UHP, Indiana Oxygen) at 773 K (0.0167 K s–1) for 4 h.
2.3 Zeolite Characterization
Zeolite topologies were determined from powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns measured on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.154 nm) operated at 1.76 kW. Typically, 0.50 g of zeolite powder were loaded onto a high volume sample holder (Rigaku) and the diffraction pattern was measured from 4–40° 2θ at a scan rate of 0.04° s–1. Powder XRD patterns for all synthesized materials were compared to a known reference material and to diffraction patterns for CHA (SSZ-13) and MOR reported in the International Zeolite Association (IZA) structure database. (44) All XRD patterns are normalized such that the maximum peak intensity in each pattern is set to unity, and are shown in Section S.8 of the Supporting Information.
Zeolite micropore volumes were determined from Ar adsorption isotherms measured on H-SSZ-13 samples held at 87 K in a liquid Ar bath using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer. Micropore volumes were obtained by converting adsorbed gas volumes (cm3 gcat–1 at STP) to liquid volumes using a density conversion factor assuming the liquid density of Ar at 87 K. Samples were pelleted and sieved to a nominal diameter between 180 and 250 μm before degassing by heating 0.03–0.05 g of sieved sample to 393 K (0.167 K s–1) under high vacuum (∼5 μmHg) for 2 h and then further heating to 623 K (0.167 K s–1) under high vacuum (∼5 μmHg) and holding for 9 h. Micropore volumes (cm3 gcat–1 at STP) were estimated from extrapolation of the linear volumetric uptake during the beginning of mesopore filling (∼0.08–0.30 P/P0) to zero relative pressure, which agreed with micropore volumes estimated from analyzing the semilog derivative plot of the adsorption isotherm (∂(Vads)/∂(ln(P/P0)) vs ln(P/P0)). All Ar adsorption isotherms are shown in Section S.9 of the Supporting Information.
Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was used to determine the total Si, Al, Na, Cu, and Co content of each sample using a PerkinElmer AAnalyst 300 Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. Samples were prepared for AAS measurements by dissolving 0.02 g of zeolite in 3 g of hydrofluoric acid (48 wt %, Sigma-Aldrich), letting the solution sit overnight, and then diluting with 60 g of deionized water (18.2 MΩ). Caution: when working with HF acid, use appropriate personal protective equipment, ventilation, and other safety measures. Absorbances were measured using radiation sources at wavelengths of 251.6 nm and 309.3 nm for Si and Al, respectively, in a reducing acetylene/nitrous oxide flame and at wavelengths of 589.0 nm, 324.8 nm, and 240.7 nm for Na, Cu, and Co, respectively, in an oxidizing acetylene/air flame. Elemental compositions were determined from calibration curves derived from known standard solutions.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were performed on a TA Instruments SDT Q600 thermogravimetric analyzer and differential scanning calorimeter (TGA-DSC) by heating 0.02 g of as-synthesized SSZ-13 in 83.3 cm3 s–1 gcat–1 dry air (UHP, 99.999%, Indiana Oxygen) to 523 K (0.167 K s–1) and holding for 0.5 h to remove physisorbed water before further heating to 1073 K (0.167 K s–1). Combustion of the organic structure directing agent was characterized by a sharp exothermic heat flow centered around 773 K, which was accompanied by a sharp decrease in mass. All SSZ-13 samples exhibited a weight loss of about 20 wt % associated with combustion of TMAda+, corresponding to one TMAda+ molecule per CHA cage (Table S.1, Section S.10 in Supporting Information), consistent with reported organic weight loss of TMAda+ synthesized SSZ-13. (23, 33)
27Al magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectra were recorded on H-SSZ-13 zeolite samples to quantify their fraction of framework and extraframework Al. NMR spectra of H-SSZ-13 were collected using a Chemagnetics CMX-Infinity 400 spectrometer in a wide-bore 9.4 T magnet (Purdue Interdepartmental NMR Facility) and were acquired at ambient conditions using a 2.3 μs pulse (equivalent to ca. 30°), an acquisition time of 12.8 ms, and a relaxation delay of 1s and were measured at 104.24 MHz and a MAS rate of 5 kHz. 1H decoupling was used during acquisition, employing two-pulse phase modulation (TPPM) scheme. Zeolite samples were hydrated by holding for >48 h in a desiccator containing a saturated potassium chloride (KCl) solution prior to packing in a 4 mm ZrO2 rotor. All 27Al MAS NMR spectra are referenced to a static sample of AlCl3 dissolved in D2O (0 ppm 27Al line) and are shown in Section S.11 of the Supporting Information.
29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded on H-SSZ-13 samples to characterize their coordination of Si atoms. Spectra of H-SSZ-13 were collected using a Chemagnetics CMX-Infinity 400 spectrometer in a wide-bore 9.4 T magnet (Purdue Interdepartmental NMR Facility) operated at 79.6 MHz and equipped with a 5 mm H-X-Y MAS probe. Zeolite samples were packed in 5 mm ZrO2 rotors and spun with a MAS rate of 5.6 kHz at room temperature. Single-pulse spectra were obtained using a 29Si pulse of 5 μs (ca. 90 deg) and CP spectra used a 1H 90° pulse of 5 μs and a contact time of 2 ms. Both types of spectra were collected with a relaxation delay of 60 s and an acquisition time of 20.5 ms were used, along with 1H decoupling during acquisition using the TPPM modulation scheme. Zeolite samples were hydrated by holding for >48 h in a desiccator containing a saturated potassium chloride (KCl) solution prior to packing in a 5 mm ZrO2 rotor. All 29Si MAS NMR spectra are referenced to a solid sodium salt of 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS) with the 29Si line referenced to 0 ppm.
The number of H+ sites on H-form zeolites was quantified by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of samples after liquid-phase ion-exchange with NH4+ cations, while the number of residual H+ sites on metal-exchanged zeolites (Cu- and Co-SSZ-13) was quantified by TPD of samples saturated with gas-phase NH3 after performing purging treatments that remove all non-Brønsted bound NH3 from the samples, as reported in detail elsewhere. (45, 46) TPD experiments were performed using a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 Chemisorption analyzer connected to an Agilent 5973N mass selective detector (MSD).
UV–visible spectroscopy (UV–vis) was used to determine the oxidation state of Co2+ ions and to detect the presence of Co-oxides on Co-SSZ-13(15, 1) after exchange with Co(NO3)2 solutions of varying molarity. Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra were recorded under ambient conditions using a Varian Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR Spectrophotometer attached with a Harrick Scientific Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance accessory. Baseline spectra were recorded for every sample using barium sulfate (BaSO4; 98 wt %, Sigma-Aldrich) as a 100% reflectance reference material and also on H-SSZ-13(15, 1), which is subtracted from the Co-SSZ-13(15, 1) spectra. Spectra were recorded from 12 500 to 50 000 cm–1 at a scan rate of 167 cm–1 s–1. Typically, 0.10–0.15 g of Co-SSZ-13 samples were loaded into a sample cup and pressed with a clean microscope slide until the surface was uniform.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Quantification of Isolated and Paired Al in SSZ-13 Zeolites
Methods were first developed to quantify the number of protons that compensate isolated and paired Al sites in H-SSZ-13 zeolites of different elemental composition. Each high-silica (Si/Al > 10) sample is denoted as H-SSZ-13(X, Y), where X and Y are the Si/Al ratio and the Na+/TMAda+ ratio in the synthesis gel. High-silica SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 15, 25) were crystallized from precursor solutions containing equimolar amounts of Na+ and TMAda+ cations but different Al contents, (28, 39) and one low-silica SSZ-13 zeolite (Si/Al = 5) was prepared using TMAda+ cations and low-silica FAU zeolites as the Al source. (33) H-SSZ-13(5), H-SSZ-13(15, 1), and H-SSZ-13(25, 1) showed XRD patterns consistent with phase-pure CHA (Figure S.1, Supporting Information). Micropore volumes were consistent with the CHA topology for H-SSZ-13(15, 1) and H-SSZ-13(25, 1) zeolites (0.18–0.19 cm3 g–1, Ar adsorption isotherms in Figure S.8, Supporting Information) but slightly lower for H-SSZ-13(5) zeolites made via FAU-to-CHA transformation (0.16 cm3 g–1) (23) that are also characterized by H+/Al ratios (0.65 by NH3 TPD) and framework Al contents (Alf/Altot = 0.85 by 27Al MAS NMR) lower than expected for phase-pure CHA. (46)
H-SSZ-13(5), H-SSZ-13(15, 1), and H-SSZ-13(25, 1) samples were equilibrated with aqueous Cu(NO3)2 solutions of increasing molarity to obtain partially Cu-exchanged zeolites, with solid Cu/Al ratios measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The numbers of residual H+ sites on H-form and Cu-exchanged zeolites were measured by NH3 temperature-programmed desorption after NH3-saturated samples were held in flowing wet helium (3% H2O, 433 K) to remove Cu-bound NH3 and retain only NH4+ species. (45, 46) Cu exchanged predominantly as isolated Cu2+ cations for two H+ sites until Cu/Al ratios of 0.21, 0.09, and 0.05 on H-SSZ-13(5), H-SSZ-13(15, 1), and H-SSZ-13(25, 1), respectively, and then as isolated [CuOH]+ complexes for one H+ site (Table S.2, Figure S.14, Supporting Information), consistent with DFT calculations and variable temperature-programmed XRD analysis indicating that a Cu2+ cation exchanged at 2 Al atoms in a 6-MR is the most stable Cu exchange site in CHA zeolites. (13, 42) The transition from Cu2+ to [CuOH]+ agrees quantitatively with statistical estimates of the number of paired Al atoms in a 6-MR of CHA based on a random Al distribution obeying Löwenstein’s rule (Figure S.15, Supporting Information). (47) These findings also agree with recent observations that SSZ-13 zeolites crystallized from synthesis gels containing equimolar amounts of Na+ and TMAda+ (Si/Al = 4–55) exchanged an equivalent number of Cu2+ cations as the number of paired Al predicted for a random Al distribution. (23) Taken together, these data suggest that the Cu2+ saturation capacity provides a direct measurement of the number of paired Al and that synthesis gels containing equimolar amounts of Na+ and TMAda+ but varying Al content crystallize SSZ-13(X, 1) zeolites with their framework Al atoms distributed randomly, subject to Löwenstein’s rule.
H-SSZ-13 samples were also equilibrated with aqueous Co(NO3)2 solutions of increasing molarity to obtain partially Co-exchanged zeolites and measure ion-exchange isotherms (derivation in Section S.14, Supporting Information), in order to corroborate the findings from Cu-exchange, considering previous evidence for the nonrandom ordering of Al atoms in certain CHA zeolites. (48, 49) In contrast with Cu exchange, Co exchanged exclusively as isolated Co2+ cations with Langmuirian adsorption behavior until saturation, as shown for H-SSZ-13(15, 1) in Figure 1a, evident in the replacement of two H+ sites per exchanged Co cation (Figure 2). Diffuse reflectance UV–vis (DRUV) spectra recorded under ambient conditions on Co-SSZ-13(15, 1) zeolites with varying Co content (Co/Al = 0.02–0.08) are shown for the d–d transition region (12 500–28 500 cm–1) in Figure 3 (full spectra in Figure S.16, Supporting Information). Increasing Co content in Co-SSZ-13(15, 1) resulted in a linear increase in the area of DRUV absorption bands for d–d electronic transitions of isolated, octahedrally coordinated, hydrated Co2+ cations (∼19 000 cm–1, Figure 3 inset), which are observed at similar energies for electronic transitions of isolated, tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ cations located near 6-MRs of dehydrated FAU zeolites. (50-54) Absorption bands in a region reflecting charge transfer transitions in Co oxides (25 000–33 000 cm–1) (51, 53) do not appear in the spectra of any Co-SSZ-13(15, 1) sample except that containing Co/Al = 0.08, where a small feature centered ∼26 500 cm–1 is detectable but likely reflects trigonally coordinated Co2+ within a 6-MR, which exhibits an additional higher energy d–d transition (∼24 000–27 000 cm–1) in FAU and LTA zeolites. (52, 53, 55, 56)

Saturation Co2+/Al and Cu2+/Al uptakes were identical on all three H-SSZ-13 samples (Figure 4) and also identical to the fraction of Al pairs predicted at these Si/Al ratios if framework Al atoms were distributed randomly subject to Löwenstein’s rule (Section S.13, Supporting Information). (13) We conclude that Co2+ cations selectively titrate paired Al in CHA zeolites (24) and that the number of Al atoms in a paired configuration can be quantified from twice the saturation Co2+ exchange capacity, as long as spectroscopic and titration evidence verifies the sole presence of Co2+ cations. The saturation Co2+ exchange capacity is a direct and functional descriptor of the number of framework Al sites that can stabilize an extraframework divalent charge (i.e., paired Al), which is different than the number of proximal Al sites detected by Al characterization methods such as NMR, because Al atoms may be separated by two Si T atoms (Al–O-(Si–O)2–Al) but generate H+ sites within different pores. (27) We also conclude that synthesis solutions containing equimolar amounts of Na+ and TMAda+ crystallized SSZ-13 zeolites with randomly distributed framework Al atoms at different compositions, which was unexpected considering the nonrandom siting of Al atoms reported for CHA (48, 49) and other zeolites.

3.2 Distribution of Al Atoms in SSZ-13 Zeolites Synthesized Using only N,N,N-Trimethyl-1-adamantylammonium Cations
High-silica SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 15, 25) crystallized from solutions comprising equimolar amounts of Na+ and TMAda+ contained a detectable fraction of paired Al atoms, as quantified by their saturation uptakes of divalent cations. The maximum density of framework Al atoms beyond which the incorporation of additional Al causes unavoidable formation of next-nearest-neighbor Al arrangements (Al–O–Si–O–Al) can be calculated from the topological density of zeolite frameworks (63, 64) and occurs for CHA at a Si/Al ratio of ∼7, (63) suggesting that SSZ-13 with Si/Al > 7 can be prepared, in theory, to contain exclusively isolated Al atoms. Each TMAda+ cation contains a large hydrophobic adamantyl moiety (∼0.7 nm diam.) covalently bound to a singly charged quaternary ammonium center and occupies the void space within one CHA cage (18 T atoms). (33) Thus, we hypothesized that SSZ-13 crystallized solely in the presence of TMAda+, based on steric constraints, should result in the isolation of one Al atom per CHA cage (Si/Al = 17, defect-free).
The hydroxide-mediated crystallization of SSZ-13 using only TMAda+, in the absence of alkali, was attempted at different synthesis solution Si/Al ratios (10–60) with all other synthesis parameters held constant. Precursor solutions containing Si/Al ratios of 15 (repeated a total of six times), 20, 25, and 30 were able to crystallize phase-pure CHA zeolites (XRD patterns in Figure S.2, Ar adsorption isotherms in Figure S.9, Supporting Information) with solid Si/Al ratios between 15 and 26. All crystalline samples contained undetectable amounts of extraframework Al by 27Al NMR (spectra in Section S.11, Supporting Information) and H+/Al ratios measured by NH3 titration between 0.94 and 0.98 (Table 1), reflecting the nearly complete incorporation of Al atoms within the CHA framework. The Co2+ exchange isotherm measured on SSZ-13(15, 1) shows Langmuirian adsorption behavior to saturation at Co/Al = 0.09, while SSZ-13(15, 0) showed negligible Co2+ exchange even at >10× higher aqueous-phase [Co2+]/[H+]2 ratios (Figure 1a). In sharp contrast, Na+ exchange isotherms (Figure 1b) on SSZ-13(15, 0) and SSZ-13(15, 1) reached saturation at Na/Al = 0.91 and 1.02, respectively (isotherm derivation in Section S.16, Supporting Information). These data suggest that all Al atoms are completely isolated in SSZ-13 zeolites synthesized with only TMAda+ cations, consistent with the occlusion of 1 TMAda+ molecule per CHA cage, as inferred from thermogravimetric analysis (Table 1), that directs the siting of 1 Al atom per CHA cage.

29Si MAS NMR spectra (Figure 5, solid traces) of SSZ-13(15, 0) and SSZ-13(15, 1) appear indistinguishable and show high occupancies of both Q4 sites (Si–(O–Si)4: δ = −111 ppm) and Q3 sites ((Si–O)3–Si–(O–Al): δ = −105 ppm), along with a third feature ca. −101 ppm that reflects either Q2 sites ((Si–O)2–Si–(O–Al)2) or silanol groups (Si(OSi)3OH). (40, 65)1H–29Si CP MAS NMR spectra (Figure 5, dashed traces) showed a distinct resonance ca. −101 ppm, suggesting that silanol groups, but not Q2 sites, are also present on these samples. These data suggest that Al–(O–Si)2–O–Al linkages are formed preferentially over Al–O–Si–O–Al linkages (29Si Q2 sites) in SSZ-13(15, 1), as has also been observed in FAU zeolites, (66, 67) but that not even Al–(O–Si)2–O–Al linkages are formed in SSZ-13(15, 0) zeolites, which are unable to exchange Co2+ cations (Figure 1a).

Attempts to crystallize SSZ-13 zeolites with Si/Al > 30 in hydroxide media with only TMAda+ as the structure-directing agent resulted in amorphous phases, apparently because crystallization was frustrated by the requirement to form anionic framework vacancy defects to balance excess cationic charges in occluded TMAda+ cations that did not balance framework Al (Table 1). These observations are consistent with the ability of SSZ-13 to crystallize with low Al densities (Si/Al > 60) and in a purely siliceous form (Si/Al = ∞) in the presence of fluoride anions (Section S.3, Supporting Information), (68) which remain occluded within crystalline solids to balance excess cationic charges introduced by TMAda+ cations. SSZ-13 synthesis solutions with Si/Al < 15 also formed amorphous phases when only TMAda+ was present, yet formed phase-pure SSZ-13 (Si/Al = 9) when additional Na+ cations were added to these solutions (Figure S.4, Table S.3, Supporting Information), indicating that such high concentrations of AlO4– tetrahedra led to anionic charge densities higher than TMAda+ cations alone were capable of stabilizing. These observations are consistent with charge density mismatch theory, (69-74) which proposes that the crystallization of aluminosilicate synthesis solutions with a high density of anionic charge (i.e., low Si/Al ratios, high concentrations of AlO4– tetrahedra) becomes inhibited in the presence of SDAs with low cationic charge density (e.g., bulky organics), (71, 72) and that the addition of small amounts of cations with higher charge density (e.g., Na+) can help overcome this barrier to crystallization. (70) Although previous work has shown that charge density mismatch approaches can be used to crystallize zeolites of new topology (e.g., UFI) (74) or known zeolites at compositions that were previously inaccessible (e.g., BPH and LTA with Si/Al > 1, and ERI with Si/Al > 5), (73-75) the demonstration herein illustrates that these approaches can control the arrangement of isolated and paired Al atoms in a given zeolite at fixed composition.
None of the SSZ-13(X, 0) zeolites were able to exchange detectable amounts of Co2+ (Table 1), demonstrating that SSZ-13 crystallized solely in the presence of TMAda+ contains only isolated framework Al (1 Al per 6-MR). All SSZ-13(X, 0) samples contained one 1 TMAda+ molecule per CHA cage (Table S.1), as expected during the formation of CHA crystallites. (23, 33) Furthermore, Cu exchanged onto SSZ-13(15, 0) solely as [CuOH]+ species (Cu/Al = 0.24, residual H+/Al = 0.76, Figure 6) as expected if every framework Al atom were isolated, in sharp contrast to the sequential exchange of Cu2+ at paired Al and [CuOH]+ at isolated Al on SSZ-13(15, 1) (Figure 6 and Figure S.14, Supporting Information). These findings also agree with recent reports of the predominance of monovalent [CuOH]+ species in high-silica Cu-SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 14, Cu/Al = 0.44) (76-79) synthesized using only TMAda+ cations in fluoride media, (40) as would be expected from the incorporation of isolated Al atoms by TMAda+ cations. The different Na+/TMAda+ ratios used to synthesize H-SSZ-13(15, 0) and H-SSZ-13(15, 1) resulted in zeolites with identical bulk compositions (Si/Al = 15, H+/Al = 0.98), but dramatic differences in their distributions of isolated and paired framework Al sites, suggesting that the use of monovalent SDAs of different size and cationic charge density directly influenced the arrangement and distribution of the framework Al atoms. These findings extend the concepts of charge density mismatch in zeolite crystallization and demonstrate that using organic and inorganic SDA mixtures opens routes to systematically control the arrangement of matter in zeolites at fixed composition of matter.

The two dashed lines correspond to slopes of −2 and −1, reflecting exchange of only isolated Cu2+ or [CuOH]+, respectively.
3.3 Effect of Synthesis Gel Cationic Charge Density on the Arrangement of Al in SSZ-13 Zeolites
The synthesis solutions used to crystallize SSZ-13(15, 0) and SSZ-13(15, 1) contained constant total cationic charge ((Na+ + TMAda+)/Al) but different cationic charge densities, as a result of different ratios of two monovalent cations (Na+/TMAda+) with different molecular volumes. Thus, we next focused on systematically varying the molar ratio of Na+/TMAda+ (i.e., cationic charge density) between 0 and 3 at a fixed synthesis solution composition (Si/Al = 15), fixed total cationic charge ((Na++TMAda+)/Al = 7.5), and fixed total hydroxide concentration (OH–/Al = 7.5). Precursor solutions with constant total cationic charge and Si/Al ratio (15) crystallized phase-pure CHA zeolites with Si/Al = 15 (Table 2), whose occluded TMAda+ content was measured by TGA (1 TMAda+ per cage, Table S.1, Supporting Information) and Na+ content was measured by AAS. The (TMAda+ + Na+)/Al ratio on each SSZ-13(15, X) sample was near unity (Table 2), indicating that every framework Al atom was charge-balanced by either a TMAda+ or Na+ cation. Precursor solutions with increasing Na+/TMAda+ ratio (0 to 1) crystallized SSZ-13(15, X) zeolites that showed a linear increase in saturation Co2+ uptakes between Co/Al values of 0 and 0.08 (Figure 7), which range from the limit of Al isolation (Co/Al = 0) to that predicted for a random Al distribution (Co/Al = 0.09). (13) As Na+/TMAda+ ratios increased from 1 to 2, saturation Co2+ uptakes decreased toward zero (Figure 7), while Na+/TMAda+ ratios >2 caused a phase transition toward formation of mordenite (MOR) zeolites (XRD patterns in Figure S.5, Supporting Information).

Fraction of Al in paired configurations, measured by Co2+ titration, in SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 15) as a function of the Na+/TMAda+ ratio (i.e., cationic charge density) in crystallization media containing fixed total cationic charge. Dashed lines bound a region where a mixed CHA/MOR phase is observed.
A second set of synthesis experiments with varying total cationic charge of the precursor solution (i.e., (Na+ + TMAda+)/Al) at constant Si/Al = 15 (Table S.4, Section S.18, Supporting Information) was used to probe the influence of total cationic charge on Al siting. SSZ-13 crystallized with solid Si/Al ratios that systematically decreased from 18 to 12 with increasing total cationic charge (Figure S.17), yet the fraction of paired Al depended only on the cationic charge density determined by the Na+/TMAda+ ratio in the precursor solution (Figure 8). SSZ-13 zeolites crystallized from solutions with varying total charge had varying compositions (Si/Al = 18–12), while SSZ-13 synthesized with constant total charge had similar compositions (Si/Al = 15) (Figure 7). The decrease in the Si/Al ratio in the final crystalline SSZ-13 product suggests that the solid Al content is controlled by the total cationic charge in the synthesis solution, independent of the charge density, and depends on the ratio of cations to anionic AlO4– tetrahedra (i.e., (Na+ + TMAda+)/Al). Furthermore, both sets of SSZ-13(15) zeolites undergo a phase transformation to MOR at the same Na+/TMAda+ ratio (>2), irrespective of the Si/Al ratio or total cationic charge (Figure 8), suggesting that this phase transformation is governed by thermodynamic driving forces in order satisfy electrostatic constraints imposed by the charge density of the synthesis solution.

Fraction of Al in paired configurations, measured by titration with Co2+, in SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 15) as a function of the cationic charge density with constant cationic charge (squares) and with cationic charge (open circles). Dashed lines bound a region where a mixed CHA/MOR phase is observed.
An analogous set of experiments performed at a constant synthesis solution Si/Al ratio of 25 and constant (Na+ + TMAda+)/Al ratio (Table S.5, Section S.19, Supporting Information), but with varying cationic charge density (Na+/TMAda+), was also performed. The number of paired Al sites, measured by Co2+ titration, increased from the limit of Al site isolation (Co/Al = 0) in SSZ-13(25, 0) to the value predicted (Co/Al = 0.04) for a random Al distribution in SSZ-13 (25, 1) and then decreases as the Na+/TMAda+ content increases beyond unity (Figure S.18). These findings are analogous to the dependence of paired Al content on cationic charge density for SSZ-13(15, X) zeolites synthesized at constant total cationic charge. These data provide further evidence that the cationic charge density in the crystallization medium, varied here through the Na+/TMAda+ ratio, influences the siting of Al in isolated or paired framework locations in SSZ-13 zeolites.
3.4 Proposed Role of Synthesis Gel Cationic Charge Density on Framework Al Distribution in SSZ-13 Zeolites
SSZ-13 zeolites contained predominantly isolated framework Al atoms when crystallized in the presence of only TMAda+ cations (1 per CHA cage; Table S.1, Supporting Information), as expected if each framework Al and attendant anionic charge were positioned near their cationic quaternary ammonium centers and if nonpolar siloxane portions of the zeolite framework were organized around their hydrophobic and nonpolar adamantyl groups (Scheme 2). Interestingly, SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 15) crystallized from precursor media with Na+ cations also present (Na+/TMAda+ < 2) contained a number of paired Al atoms that was similar to the Na+ content of the crystalline solid (Figure 9). We surmise this phenomenon reflects the positioning of a second framework Al atom compensated by a Na+ cation (which is sited within a 6-MR) proximal to an Al atom compensating the cationic portion of a TMAda+ cation (which is occluded within the CHA cage), in order to avoid disruption of nonpolar contacts between the siloxane framework and the adamantyl group of TMAda+ (Scheme 2). Although zeolite crystallization predominantly occurs by a series of kinetically controlled processes, (80-82) this hypothesis suggests that the incorporation of Al atoms into the oxide framework during crystallization can be directed via electrostatic forces and influenced by thermodynamic considerations.

Figure 9. Fraction of Al in paired configurations, measured by Co2+ titration, in SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 15) as a function of the solid Na+ content for samples synthesized from solutions containing 0 < Na+/TMAda+ < 1 (solid circles) and 1 < Na+/TMAda+ < 2 (open circles). The dashed line corresponds to a slope of two.
The amount of Na+ incorporated into SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 15) increases with precursor solution Na+/TMAda+ ratios between 0 and 1, and then decreases as Na+/TMAda+ ratios increase further between 1 and 2 (Table 2), beyond which additional Na+ causes a phase transformation to MOR (Figure 7). These phenomena appear to reflect the partitioning of Na+ cations within a separate amorphous phase that does not crystallize CHA but which eventually (at Na+/TMAda+ > 2) crystallizes MOR (Figure 7), a commonly observed competition between organic and alkali cations present in zeolite synthesis solutions. (83) We note that different Na+ concentrations in crystallization media of pentasil zeolites (e.g., MFI) have been observed to influence the paired Al density measured by Co2+ titration, (25) but in a nonsystematic and uncontrolled manner, either because other synthesis parameters (e.g., counteranions, Si and Al precursors used) were not controlled for, or because Na+ and tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) mixtures used to crystallize MFI zeolites do not function mechanistically as the Na+ and TMAda+ mixtures used here to crystallize CHA zeolites.
4 Conclusions
Titration procedures to quantify the number of paired Al sites in SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 5, 15, 25) using divalent Co2+ were developed by measurement of ion-exchange isotherms on samples synthesized using an equimolar amount of Na+ and TMAda+. The sole presence of isolated Co2+ cations on samples exposed to ambient conditions was verified by diffuse-reflectance UV–visible spectra, which showed bands for d–d transition at ∼19 000 cm–1 characteristic of hydrated Co2+ cations and whose integrated area increased linearly with increasing Co content. Furthermore, each exchanged Co2+ cation replaced two H+ sites, quantified by selective titration of residual H+ sites in Co-exchanged SSZ-13 zeolites using gaseous NH3 saturation and purge procedures developed to retain only NH4+ species. (45) The number of paired Al sites on SSZ-13 zeolites was also determined by counting residual H+ sites after different extents of Cu cation exchange, which occurs sequentially as isolated Cu2+ cations at paired Al sites and then as [CuOH]+ species at isolated Al sites. On SSZ-13 samples crystallized using equimolar ratios of Na+ and TMAda+, saturation Cu2+ uptakes agreed quantitatively with saturation Co2+ uptakes and the predicted number of Al pairs for a random Al distribution obeying Löwenstein’s rule. These spectroscopic and titration data provide the requisite evidence to confirm the sole presence of Co2+ cations at coverages that saturate paired Al sites, which cannot be assumed or asserted based solely on the adoption of Co2+ ion-exchange protocols reported previously.
SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 15–30) synthesized solely in the presence of TMAda+ cations did not contain any paired Al sites, evident in their inability to exchange Co2+ or Cu2+ cations, indicating the complete isolation of framework Al atoms. SSZ-13 zeolites synthesized at fixed Si/Al ratio (15 or 25) with varying ratios of Na+ and TMAda+ cations in the synthesis solution, while all other synthesis parameters were held constant, contained a number of paired Al sites that increased linearly with solution Na+/TMAda+ ratio (0–1), and reached a maximum value at Na+/TMAda+ = 1. The number of Al pairs in SSZ-13 decreased as the Na+/TMAda+ ratio increased from 1 to 2, beyond which a phase transformation to MOR occurred. The number of paired Al correlated linearly with the retained Na+ content in crystalline SSZ-13 products, suggesting that Na+ cations are sited proximal to cationic quaternary-ammonium centers of TMAda+ so as to induce Al pairing and avoid disruption of nonpolar contacts between siloxane bonds and the hydrophobic adamantyl group of TMAda+. The distribution of isolated and paired Al sites in SSZ-13 can be systematically controlled by varying the Na+/TMAda+ ratio, a surrogate for the synthesis gel cationic charge density.
The findings reported herein demonstrate that the cationic charge density of the crystallization medium, determined by the amounts of organic and inorganic structure directing agents present, influences the anionic charge density in the zeolite lattice, determined by the distribution of framework Al atoms. We expect that the approach described herein, to control the isolation and pairing of Al atoms by manipulating the cationic charge density in the crystallization medium, can be adapted to control the arrangement of Al atoms at fixed elemental composition (Si/Al) in other zeolite topologies that utilize mixtures of organic and inorganic structure directing agents. The arrangement of framework Al atoms influences the hydrothermal stability of a given zeolite and also controls the speciation of extraframework cations that behave as catalytic active sites, as in the case of monovalent [CuOH]+ complexes exchanged at isolated Al and divalent Cu2+ cations exchanged at paired Al in CHA zeolites for NOx SCR with NH3 in automotive emission control. Therefore, the ability to systematically control the arrangement of isolated and paired Al in zeolites promises to expand their structural and catalytic diversity in a manner that has remained dormant and inaccessible to date and provides access to one of the few opportunities to do so for a given zeolite at fixed composition.

Abstract
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Different Arrangements of Al Atoms between (a) Isolated and (b, c) Paired Configurations in a 6-MR
Figure 1
Figure 1. (a) Co2+ and (b) Na+ ion-exchange isotherms measured on SSZ-13(15, 0) (circles) and SSZ-13(15, 1) (squares); solid lines represent least-squares regression of data to Langmuirian isotherms.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Number of residual H+ sites measured by NH3 titration on Co-SSZ-13(15, 1) samples of increasing Co content. The two dashed lines correspond to slopes of −2 and −1, reflecting exchange of only divalent or monovalent species, respectively.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Diffuse reflectance UV–visible absorption spectra of Co-SSZ-13(15, 1) samples with increasing Co2+ content (Co/Al = 0.021, 0.027, 0.041, 0.080, 0.084 from light to dark); inset shows integrated areas for Co2+ d–d transitions (∼19 000 cm–1) as a function of Co content.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Co2+ (squares) and Cu2+ (closed circles) saturation values on SSZ-13(5), SSZ-13(15, 1), and SSZ-13(25, 1) plotted against the maximum M2+/Al predicted for a random Al distribution. Cu2+ saturation values (open circles) on SSZ-13 (Si/Al = 4–45) prepared from equimolar Na+ and TMAda+ mixtures reported by Deimund et al. (23) The dashed line represents a parity line.
Figure 5
Figure 5. 29Si MAS NMR (solid traces) and 1H–29Si CP MAS NMR (dashed traces) of (a) H-SSZ-13(15, 0) and (b) H-SSZ-13(15, 1).
Figure 6
Figure 6. Number of residual H+ sites on SSZ-13(15, 1) after increasing extents of Cu2+ exchange (circles) and after Co2+ saturation (square), and on SSZ-13(15, 0) after Cu2+ exchange (diamond). The two dashed lines correspond to slopes of −2 and −1, reflecting exchange of only isolated Cu2+ or [CuOH]+, respectively.
Figure 7
Figure 7. Fraction of Al in paired configurations, measured by Co2+ titration, in SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 15) as a function of the Na+/TMAda+ ratio (i.e., cationic charge density) in crystallization media containing fixed total cationic charge. Dashed lines bound a region where a mixed CHA/MOR phase is observed.
Figure 8
Figure 8. Fraction of Al in paired configurations, measured by titration with Co2+, in SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 15) as a function of the cationic charge density with constant cationic charge (squares) and with cationic charge (open circles). Dashed lines bound a region where a mixed CHA/MOR phase is observed.

Scheme 2. Proposed Organization of Si and Al Atoms in the CHA Crystallization Medium To Form (a) Isolated Al in the Presence of TMAda+ or (b) Paired Al in the Presence of TMAda+ and Na+
Figure 9
Figure 9. Fraction of Al in paired configurations, measured by Co2+ titration, in SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 15) as a function of the solid Na+ content for samples synthesized from solutions containing 0 < Na+/TMAda+ < 1 (solid circles) and 1 < Na+/TMAda+ < 2 (open circles). The dashed line corresponds to a slope of two.
