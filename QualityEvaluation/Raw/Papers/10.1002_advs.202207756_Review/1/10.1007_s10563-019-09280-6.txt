Abstract
Steam thermal cracking is an established technology for the production of light olefins, such as ethylene and propylene. The 
shift to lighter, ethane-based feeds means that propylene production from steam crackers will be lower than the correspond-
ing ethylene production. Therefore, alternative technologies have to be developed to produce more propylene to make up 
for the shortfall from steam cracking. This review looks at the steam catalytic cracking technology, which combines both 
catalytic cracking and steam cracking to maximize the production of light olefins. This review looks at the effect of catalyst 
and technology applied in fluid catalytic cracking reactors to enhance light olefins production. The influence of reaction 
conditions and the reaction mechanism are also presented.

Technologies for Light Olefin Production
Light olefins make up important building blocks in the pet-
rochemicals industry, with derivatives such as polyethylene 
and polypropylene being used to manufacture plastic pack-
aging, plastic bottles and car parts. The traditional route for 
light olefins production is steam cracking (SC) furnaces and 
fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) reactors. Figure 1 illustrates 
the propylene production capacity of the main technologies 
and their contribution in bridging the demand supply gap 
[1].

The traditional routes accounted for 81% propylene pro-
duction (with 50% from steam cracking and 31% from FCC), 
while the on-purpose technologies like propane dehydroge-
nation contributed 19%.
Propylene is usually obtained as by-product from steam 
crackers and FCC units which produce with mainly ethylene 
and gasoline, respectively. The type of feedstock used in 
steam crackers affect the yield of propylene. While heavy 
feeds produce more propylene, lighter feeds tend to produce 
less propylene, as illustrated in Table 1 [2]. The recent trend 
in steam crackers has been the use of ethane-based feeds 
which guarantee a bigger yield of ethylene, with far less 
propylene being produced as a by-product. Therefore there is 
expected to be a shortage of propylene, and therefore, there 
is need to look for alternative methods and technologies to 
increase the propylene yield to address forecasted supply 
and demand imbalance.
A major alternative to the steam cracker as a source of 
propylene is the FCC where the use of catalysts leads to 
much lower operating temperatures than those in steam 
crackers [4]. By employing a catalyst, it is also possible to 
tilt the selectivity in favor of propylene instead of ethylene. 
The FCC was originally designed to upgrade low value feeds 
such as vacuum gas oil (VGO) and atmospheric residue to 
gasoline, and as such, a suitable catalyst is required if light 
olefins are to form a major part of the product slate. The very 
nature of the FCC unit means that it will also struggle to 
process light feeds such as naphtha, which require relatively 
high cracking temperatures than heavy feeds. Also the use 
of light feeds need to be accompanied by suitable active and 
selective catalysts to ensure the production of light olefins. 
Other challenges associated with the use of light feed such 
as naphtha are lower coke yield, lower regenerator tempera-
ture and elevated catalyst circulation rates to account for 
higher endothermic heat of reaction since catalyst is the 
main heat carrier in the FCC. Therefore, more active cata-
lysts are required to generate sufficient coke yields to close 
the FCC energy balance in support of stable operations. It is,

therefore important to develop a technology that is capable 
of processing light feed like naphtha with the aim of maxi-
mizing light olefin production.
Therefore, a new route to convert light feeds such as 
naphtha into value added light olefins is required, and steam 
catalytic cracking is an alternative technology that combines 
useful aspects of catalytic cracking and steam cracking to 
increase the yield of both ethylene and propylene at rela-
tively lower temperatures than in steam cracking [3, 5]. The 
use of temperatures higher than those in FCC, but lower than 
those in steam crackers, in combination with a suitable cata-
lyst can help ensure that light olefins are the main products 
as illustrated in Table 2. The amount of steam used in steam 
catalytic cracking will hydrothermally deactivate conven-
tional FCC catalysts, therefore, special catalyst capable of 
withstanding high temperatures and high amount of steam 
need to be developed for commercial applications.
In steam catalytic cracking, steam is used as an inexpen-
sive diluent and also to decrease the amount of coke deposi-
tion on catalysts. Steam also plays a significant part in steam 
catalytic cracking [6]:
•	 Firstly, steam will reduce the hydrocarbon partial pres-
sure and facilitate the cracking reactions of hydrocar-
bons.
•	 Secondly, steam could inhibit bimolecular reactions, such 
as hydrogen transfer, aromatization, and polymerization, 
thanks to the reduction of the concentration of reactants 
and products which favored the selectivity of light ole-
fins.
•	 Thirdly, steam will react with hydrocarbons at a high 
temperature and accelerate the gasification of coke 
deposited on catalyst surface, and, consequently, will 
reduce the coke yield and prevent catalyst activity from 
decreasing quickly.
•	 Lastly, steam will facilitate the reactions of carbonium 
ions and favor the production of propene and butene.

Integrating Steam Catalytic Cracking 
into a Refinery or Petrochemical Complex
Most of the technologies in Table 2 can function as stand-
alone technologies; however, they can also be installed as 
complementary technologies alongside existing petrochemi-
cal complex or refinery installations to help maximize the 
yield of light olefins.
2.1  
Petrochemicals Integration of Steam Catalytic 
Cracking
By integrating steam catalytic cracking with steam cracking 
units the production of petrochemicals can be maximized as 
illustrated in Fig. 2. By routing various feed streams and by-
products to the appropriate technology, an overall product 
stream with maximum value can be obtained. For example, 
fresh feedstock can be routed to either FCC or steam pyroly-
sis type reactors. By products such as light naphtha and/
or aromatics raffinate can be recycled for steam catalytic

cracking to produce propylene and ethylene. Saturated 
byproduct streams such as ethane, propane and/or aromat-
ics raffinate are recycled for the steam cracking thermal pro-
cess to maximize ethylene production. This integration will 
enhance the production of light olefins by sending various 
by-products to the optimum cracking technology.
The full integration of steam catalytic cracking and steam 
cracking shall provide flexibility in processing a variety of 
feedstocks. The integration allows both on-purpose thermal 
and catalytic cracking units to be used in a complementary 
fashion in a new or retrofitted petrochemical complex.
2.2  
Refinery Integration to Process Recycled 
Naphtha Streams
By integrating steam catalytic cracking to refinery FCC, 
it possible to recycle low value streams which cannot be 
blended with gasoline, to produce more light olefins as 
illustrated in Fig. 3. Various naphtha feeds which are either 
partially hydrogenated or as raffinate from an extraction pro-
cess can be processed via steam catalytic technology. This 
provides a means to create value from otherwise potentially 
low value olefins-rich streams, such as FCC and coker light 
naphthas. These streams, in consideration of new motor 
gasoline regulations regarding vapor pressure, olefins con-
tent and oxygenate specifications, may have increasingly low 
value as blend stock for gasoline.

Catalyst for Steam Catalytic Cracking
Heterogeneous catalysts offer a means of influencing the 
degree of conversion of hydrocarbon feedstocks and the 
selectivity of the process with respect to light olefins. 
Catalyst is the key in the study on steam catalytic cracking 
because it affects both the product distribution and operat-
ing conditions.
For steam catalytic cracking process, the main chal-
lenge is the synergetic integration of steam cracking and 
catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons in order to produce more 
light olefins especially propylene. Steam catalytic cracking 
gives high yields of light olefins and also mitigates the huge 
energy consumption issue, since it operates at much lower 
temperatures compared to the steam cracking [14, 15]. To 
achieve this objective, development of suitable catalysts 
capable of withstanding severe thermal and hydrothermal 
conditions such as those existing in steam crackers and FCC 
is important [16–19]. The development of steam catalytic 
cracking catalysts needs to focus on producing catalysts that 
have high activity and selectivity for the production light 
olefins while minimizing the yield of hydrogen, methane and 
coke [10, 20]. The catalyst should also display the properties 
of high stability, and mechanical robustness. One way to 
achieve the desired properties and to also ensure applicabil-
ity in FCC unit, is following the procedure for conventional 
FCC catalyst, but with improved metal loading and zeolite 
modification.
Conventional FCC catalysts do display high thermal sta-
bility due to the make-up of the catalysts as illustrated in 
Fig. 4 [21]. FCC catalysts are micropsherical particles with 
an average particle size of 60–80 µm and are usually made 
of silica–alumina materials. A typical FCC catalyst particle 
comprises a zeolite as an active component dispersed on a 
matrix such as kaolin, a binder such as boehmite, and filler. 
The particle size and spherical shape of the FCC catalyst 
particles enable them to be used in a circulating fluidized 
bed, and also helps to limit the attrition rate of the particles.
The matrix of an FCC catalyst provides the platform on 
which the zeolite particles are dispersed and is made up of 
everything except the active zeolite (clay, binder and filler).

The binder helps provide attrition resistance by binding the 
zeolite and the matrix together. With active matrix, the acid 
sites catalyze the cracking of feed molecules too large to 
enter the zeolite pores. The large pores of the matrix facili-
tates the diffusion of molecules to the zeolite. The matrix 
also performs the role of metal traps, for contaminant metals 
like nickel and vanadium.
The role of the matrix in the FCC is to ensure the thermal 
stability, physical integrity and attrition resistance of catalyst 
particles, as well as providing the catalytic function of con-
verting heavy resid molecules into gas oil [10, 21–27]. The 
zeolite active component such as USY helps to upgrade gas 
oil molecules to predominantly gasoline fraction by making 
use of its pore structure and acid sites. Some other physi-
cal functions of the matrix include acting as a heat transfer 
medium, and providing a porous structure to allow diffusion 
of hydrocarbons into and out of the catalyst microspheres 
[10, 22–24, 26, 28, 29].
The nature of the pores in an FCC catalyst particle gives 
rise to a hierarchical pore architecture spanning from the 
macro- to meso- to microporosity as shown in Fig. 5 [30]. 
Each of these classes of pores is attributed to a particular 
component of the FCC catalyst and they all contribute to 
the overall conversion of feed. Resid molecules for example 
are cracked in the matrix and/or binder into shorter gas oil 
molecules. The gas oil molecules are cracked in the USY 
zeolite component of the FCC catalyst to generate gasoline, 
which further cracked by the ZSM-5 particles to generate 
LPG which usually contains light olefins [30–43].
The FCC unit was originally developed to upgrade low 
value feed to high value products like gasoline, but it has 
recently undergone further modification to increase the yield 
of by-products such as light olefins. It is for this reason that 
ZSM-5 has been incorporated into the FCC catalyst formula-
tion and/or FCC additives [44–51].
Catalytic cracking using zeolite catalyst has been 
studied by various groups using both naphtha and heavy 
feeds [51–55]. Catalyst deactivation from coke deposi-
tion cannot be avoided in the atmosphere of active olefins 
products, and dealumination of zeolite catalysts in steam 
cracking is also a challenge to long-term performance sta-
bility. Therefore, in order to make FCC catalysts suitable 
for steam catalytic cracking, the hydrothermal properties 
of the zeolite component needs to be improved. Several 
methods have been proposed in the literature to address 
this such as phosphorus impregnation, rare earth metal ion 
exchange and impregnation, as well as making the zeolite 
hydrophobic by increasing the Si/Al ratio.
One of the main challenges for catalyst destined for 
steam catalytic cracking, especially when using heavy feed 
contaminated with metals like vanadium is hydrothermal 
stability [56]. The mechanism of vanadium attack on FCC 
catalysts has been studied by various authors [56–64] and 
they all concluded that formation of vanandic acid was 
what was responsible for zeolite dealumination and sub-
sequent deactivation by structure collapse.
Rare earth oxides such as ­
La2O3 are basic in nature and 
can passivate vanadium by forming rare earth vanadates 
[65–68], thereby preventing the hydrolysis of the zeolite 
framework. The reaction of rare earths (RE) with acidic 
vanadium compounds forming vanadates is represented 
in Eq. (1):
where ­
RE2O3 is representing the rare earth oxide, forming 
stable vanadium compounds [69].
The stability and the inertness of rare earth vanadates 
under FCC conditions help to reduce zeolite deactivation 
and the formation of coke and dry gas [65, 70].

Evidence of Steam Participation 
in the Reaction
While it is widely accepted that steam affects the hydro-
thermal stability of the catalyst used in steam catalytic 
cracking, more work needs to be done to establish the 
effect steam has on the cracking reaction itself. It may 
appear that the use of steam is a cheaper alternative to 
nitrogen, but a closer look at the product distribution 
shows that the use of steam comes with other benefits, 
especially in the product distribution.
Table 3 shows the influence of steam on the product 
distribution for steam catalytic cracking of Daqing oil [6]. 
By switching the fluidizing gas from nitrogen to steam, 
there was an increase in light olefins yield. The effect of 
steam on product distribution can be attributed to the fact 
that hydrogen transfer reactions which are responsible for 
the saturation of olefins are inhibited, therefore leading to 
an increase in light olefins.
A similar observation on the effect of steam on prod-
uct yield was reported by other authors [7–9]. According 
to Meng [6], the participation of steam is attributed to 
steam gasification and water–gas shift reactions as shown 
in Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively.
Following the steam gasification and water–gas shift 
reactions, steam could facilitate the formation of carbon 
oxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen, while inhibiting the 
yield of coke.
Meng [6] also observed that with nitrogen as the flu-
idizing gas, there was no carbon dioxide detected in the 
pyrolysis gas, while small amounts of carbon dioxide was 
detected in the pyrolysis gas when steam was used as a flu-
idizing medium. The formation of carbon dioxide suggests 
that steam may also be taking part in the reaction. This 
shows that steam influences the product distribution and it

may even participate to some extend in the steam catalytic 
cracking reactions via the formation of carbon dioxide.

Influence of Reaction Parameters on Light 
Olefins Yield
As it is shown in Table 3, steam catalytic cracking influences 
the yield of light olefins, but the degree of to which this is 
effected is also a function of operating conditions, such as 
reaction temperature, residence time, steam to oil weight 
ratio, catalyst to oil weight ratio, and partial pressure.
5.1  
Effect of Reaction Temperature
The reaction temperature for steam catalytic cracking 
depends on the type of catalyst, feed and the expected prod-
uct slate from the reaction. Metal oxide catalysts generally 
require high temperature, while catalytic cracking using 
molecular sieve catalysts occurs at relatively low tempera-
tures. Jeong et al. [71] studied the steam cracking capabil-
ity of naphtha over ­
KVO3 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor 
at 800–900 °C, as illustrated in Fig. 6. In their study, they 
observed that steam catalytic cracking led to 10 and 5% 
increase in the yields of ethylene and propylene, respec-
tively, compared to the thermal pyrolysis at the same opera-
tion conditions. Figure 6 shows that ethylene production 
increases with an increase in temperature whether the reac-
tion is in the presence of a catalyst or not. For thermal crack-
ing, the yield of propylene increases with temperature, but at 
a lower rate than that of ethylene. However, for steam cata-
lytic cracking, the yield of propylene goes through a maxi-
mum. The same phenomenon was observed by Basu and 
Kunzru [72] when they studied the steam catalytic cracking 
of naphtha using CaO–Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor, 
and at a temperature of 700–900 °C.
Most of the catalyst development effort with CaO and 
­
KVO3 was carried out to either increase the yield of olefins 
or to lower the coke deposition on the reactor wall and on 
the catalyst in order to maintain its activity for the reaction. 
By studying the steam catalytic cracking of kerosene and 
gas oil cuts, Adelson et al. [73] concluded that it is pos-
sible to obtain high ethylene and propylene yield at high

temperatures by decreasing the secondary reactions, such 
as hydrogen transfer reactions that lead to the formation of 
condensation products.
The use of oxide catalysts however, does not substantially 
lower the temperature of the reaction and also, there is lit-
tle or no catalytic benefit when oxide catalysts are used. In 
order to draw the benefits associated with a reduction in 
operating temperature, it is important to investigate different 
catalytic materials that can provide an alternative reaction 
pathway with lower activation energy. The catalytic material 
should also provide additional cracking function, and it is 
in this respect that zeolites have been investigated for steam 
catalytic cracking.
Driven by the need to increase light olefin yields in addi-
tion to reducing operating temperatures to optimize the eco-
nomics, different zeolite catalysts have been investigated by 
different researchers. Wan et al. [55] and Meng et al. [6, 54, 
74, 75] investigated the steam catalytic cracking of naphtha 
and Daqing oil respectively, and they found that the opti-
mum temperature for light olefins production was between 
630 and 680 °C. This temperature range is much lower than 
the operating temperatures for steam crackers, potentially 
translating to a reduction in operating.
In another study as illustrated in Fig. 7, Meng et al. [54, 
75] showed that ethylene yield and dry gas increased with 
an increase in reaction temperature. The yields of propylene, 
butylene and overall light olefins were found to pass through 
maxima in the range of 640–700 °C. This is associated to 
the fact propylene and butylenes are intermediate products 
and can undergo secondary reactions, leading to a decrease 
in yield.
In practice, steam catalytic cracking over zeolite based 
catalysts involves catalytic cracking reactions and ther-
mal cracking reactions both on catalyst surfaces and in 
the interspaces between catalyst particles. Propylene and 
butylene are mainly generated from catalytic cracking 
reactions following the carbonium ion mechanism, and 
they are intermediate products, which can undergo such 
secondary reactions as hydrogen transfer, aromatisation, 
cracking and polyreaction. Ethylene is primarily formed 
from thermal cracking reactions following the free radi-
cal mechanism, and it is close to an end product, so it is 
unlikely to undergo any other secondary reaction, apart 
from hydrogenation to ethane. The increase in reaction 
temperature helps accelerate secondary reactions of pro-
pylene and butylene, which explains why the yield patterns 
go through maxima.
5.2  
Effect of Residence Time
For steam catalytic cracking, residence time or space time 
is an important parameter and it depends on the reactor 
configuration. An optimum residence time will guarantee 
a high yield of light olefins. If the residence time is below 
the optimum, there is the possibility of producing less pro-
pylene than anticipated due to low conversion. A longer 
residence time will lead to more secondary reactions and 
the subsequent conversion of light olefins to undesired 
products. This is illustrated in the study by Sha et al. [76] 
and summarized in Fig. 8. The figure shows that the yield 
of light olefins first goes up until a residence time of 2.0 s, 
where it then levels off. Similar conclusions were reached 
by Basu and Kunzru [72].

Effect of Catalyst to Oil Ratio
The amount of catalyst active sites that contact the feed 
will vary depending on the temperature of the regenerated 
catalyst, catalyst formula, reactor severity, feed quality and 
conditions. A high catalyst-to-oil (C/O) ratio is preferred to 
maximize conversion and light olefin selectivity [74, 77, 78]. 
Sha et al. [76] investigated the effect of C/O ratio on light 
olefin yield during the steam catalytic cracking of atmos-
pheric residue over LCM-5 catalyst as summarized in Fig. 9.
Figure 9 shows that increasing C/O led to an increase in 
the yields of ethylene and dry gas, while propylene went 
through a maximum. As catalyst is the main source of heat 
for FCC, an increase the C/O ratio increases the severity of 
secondary reactions such as hydrogenation and condensation 
reaction, leading to overcracking and more saturates. Subse-
quently, more dry gas is produced, which in this case is made 
up of mainly methane and ethane. For thermal cracking, free 
radicals are formed through the splitting C–C bonds and 
H–C bonds, and then inclined to undergoing alpha scission, 
beta scission, and polymerization to produce ­
H2, methane, 
ethylene and coke [79]. At higher C/O, thermal cracking is 
effectively inhibited as hydrocarbons.
5.4  
Effect of Steam to Hydrocarbon Feed Ratio
Although steam is used as an inexpensive diluent and also 
to decrease the amount of coke deposition on catalysts, the 
amount of light olefins products is usually influenced by 
the amount of steam used. Using a reaction temperature of 
650 °C, residence time of 2.7 s and catalyst-to-oil weight 
ratio of 15.5, Meng et al. [58] investigated the effectiveness 
of steam-to-oil weight ratio in the range of 0.2–1.6 on prod-
uct yields and product distribution (see Fig. 10). From their 
study, they found that the yield of light olefins increased 
with an increase in steam-to-oil ratio.
The results in Fig. 10 can be explained by the fact that 
steam reduces the hydrocarbon partial pressure and this 
helps to suppress secondary bi-molecular reactions and 
thus favors the yield of light olefins. Therefore, using a large 
steam-to-oil ratio leads to a high yield of light olefins. How-
ever, the quantity of steam used in the reaction system is also 
influenced by the economic benefits and the steam disposal 
capacity of the units [76, 80]. This is because the production 
of high temperature steam is an energy consuming process 
and therefore, the optimum steam/oil ratio is required.

Effect of Hydrocarbon Feed Properties
The aromaticity of a feed can be assessed from its BMCI 
[81, 82], a correlation index developed by the U.S. Bureau 
of Mines. The BMCI relates the average boiling point (mid 
boiling point) of a distillation fraction to its specific gravity 
as defined by the empirical formula in Eq. (5) below:

cific gravity of the fraction at 15.6/15.6 °C.
Feed is classified as paraffinic when it has a BMCI of 
0–15; it is classified as an intermediate feed when its BMCI 
is 15–50, while a BMCI above 50 means the feed is naph-
thenic and indicative of aromatic oils. The BMCI can also 
be correlated to the yield of ethylene in steam crackers [81, 
83, 84] and light olefins during catalytic cracking [75]. Fig-
ure 11 shows the result from a steam cracker study, carried 
out by Scherzer et al. [81] and it shows that the lower the 
BMCI, the higher the ethylene and light olefins yield.
The same phenomenon is observed for steam catalytic 
cracking. Feedstocks that are high in aromatics have low 
hydrogen content, and therefore, are resistant to conversion 
at typical FCC residence times [3]. The effect of feed aroma-
ticity during catalytic cracking is illustrated in Fig. 12 [58].
Figure 12 shows that as the aromatic content of the feed 
increases, light olefins yield decreases. This is because light 
olefins are produced via cracking of side chains of aromatic

ring, while the aromatic rings themselves are difficult to 
crack except at high hydrogen pressure. Therefore, the 
aromatic carbon content can be used to estimate the steam 
catalytic cracking ability of feedstocks. Feeds with high aro-
matic content also act as coke precursors and usually have 
the tendency to produce more coke during catalytic cracking 
[49, 85].

Steam Catalytic Cracking Reaction 
Mechanism
Most work on steam catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons is 
mainly focused on the development of catalysts and tech-
nologies, but not enough attention is given to the reaction 
mechanisms. With regards to the reaction mechanisms for 
steam catalytic cracking, there is a divided opinion as to the 
actual mechanism, and this has been prompted by fact that 
factors such as temperature and catalyst impact the actual 
mechanism in play. Steam cracking, which is a thermal pro-
cess usually, proceeds by the free radical mechanism and 
some catalyst can promote the formation of free radicals. 
This phenomenon was reported in a study by Zeng [86], 
where Ca–Al catalysts where found to accelerate the initial 
reactions of free radicals. Zhang et al. [87] also observed the 
same effect with catalysts containing potassium vanadate, 
manganese, and chromium oxides as active components. It 
is widely accepted that steam catalytic cracking of hydrocar-
bons over oxide catalysts follows the free-radical mechanism 
[88, 89].
Cracking reactions over acidic catalysts like zeolites 
usually proceed via the carbonium ion mechanism [49, 
51, 90–92]. Catalytic cracking mechanism is usually pre-
dominant at lower temperatures. The combination of steam 
cracking and catalytic cracking means the interplay of free 
radical and catalytic cracking mechanisms, since the reac-
tion temperature is relatively high. This means mechanistic 
pathways and product distribution during steam catalytic 
cracking is the result of a dual reaction mechanism. Acidic 
molecular sieves like ZSM-5 contain both Brønsted (proton 
acidic centers) and Lewis (non-proton acidic centers) sites. 
Cracking reactions over Brønsted acid sites take place via 
the carbonium ion mechanism. The carbonium ions undergo 
α-cracking reactions resulting in a smaller paraffin and more 
stable carbenium ion which can further be desorbed as a 
smaller alkene. Cracking on Lewis acid sites proceeds via 
both the carbonium ion mechanism and the free radical 
mechanism. Lewis acid sites activate adsorption of hydro-
carbons, boost the breaking of C–C bonds, and accelerate 
the formation of free radicals and the cracking of β-bonds. 
Brønsted acid sites favor the formation of light olefins; while 
strong Lewis acid sites are accelerate coke formation [76, 
80, 93–96].

The above observation show that the reaction mechanism 
used to describe steam catalytic cracking varies with cata-
lysts and technologies. For FCC related processes, steam 
catalytic cracking involves catalytic cracking reactions and 
thermal pyrolysis reactions, controlled by both the free radi-
cal mechanism and the carbonium ion mechanism. As for 
cracking process on metal oxide catalyst such as Ca–Al, the 
free radical mechanism plays a leading role, while the car-
bonium ion mechanism plays an important part for cracking 
process on acidic molecule sieve catalysts at low tempera-
tures. However, for catalytic cracking at high temperatures 
over zeolite catalysts with double acidic centers, both the 
free radial mechanism and the carbonium ion mechanism 
play an important role.
6.1  
Mechanistic Pathway for Steam Catalytic 
Cracking
It is possible to use the product distribution to establish the 
predominant mechanistic pathway for a particular steam 
catalytic cracking process. This is because product distribu-
tion is heavily influenced by the mechanistic pathway of the 
reaction.
This approach was used by Meng et al. [54] to determine 
the mechanistic pathway for the steam catalytic cracking of 
Daqing AR. They did this by studying the production of i-C4 
and n-C4 products, with assumption that i-C4 is a typical 
product arising from carbonium ion mechanism, while n-C4 
is formed mostly through the free radical mechanism. With 
this assumption, they used the flowing equation to explain 
the relative percentages of the two mechanisms acting in 
catalytic pyrolysis processes:
where ­
Rm is the mechanism parameter of steam catalytic 
cracking.
A larger value of ­
Rm indicates that the carbonium ion 
mechanism plays a bigger function in steam catalytic crack-
ing. A smaller ­
Rm value indicates that the free radical mech-
anism operates predominantly. The ­
Rm and the relative per-
centages of reaction mechanism values are summarized in 
Figs. 13 and 14, and are based on the results by Meng et al. 
[54] using different catalysts (CEP-1, LCM-5 and AKZO)
and reaction temperatures.
The results in Fig. 13 show Quartz and LCM-5 have low 
­
Rm values compared to AKZO and CEP-1. However, the 
­
Rm value decreases for all catalyst, as reaction temperature 
increases, indicating that the effect of the free radical mecha-
nism in catalytic pyrolysis processes becomes more signifi-
cant, and that of the carbonium ion mechanism becomes less 
significant. The observed trends are expected because quartz 
and LCM-5 rarely contain proton acidic centers on which 
(6)
Rm = i −C4
n −C4,
carbonium ion reactions are initiated, and as a result the 
free radical mechanism is predominant on these surfaces. 
CEP-1 and AKZO contain both proton and non-proton acidic 
centers, which can promote the reactions of both carbonium 
ions and free radicals, with CEP-1 having depleted protonic 
acidic centers compared to AKZO (a typical conventional 
FCC catalyst.
Figure 14 shows that the relative percentage of the free 
radical mechanism increases with temperature, while the 
opposite trend is observed for the carbonium ion. Figure 14a 
shows that the free radical mechanism is more predominant 
when LCM-5 is used as a catalyst for steam catalytic crack-
ing. Figure 14b shows that for CEP-1 catalyst, both the 
free radical and carbonium ion reaction mechanisms play 
important parts in the process, although the free radical 
mechanism becomes more predominant as the temperature 
increases.

Conclusions
This review highlights the role steam plays in steam cata-
lytic cracking technology. It shows that steam not only plays 
the function of a diluent and fluidizing gas, but it can also 
influence the product distribution. Product distribution from 
steam catalytic cracking is also influenced by several factors 
such as catalyst, feedstocks properties and reaction param-
eters. The review also shows that the reaction temperature of 
metal oxide based catalysts is commonly 50–200 °C higher 
than that of molecular sieve based catalysts. Although for 
different steam catalytic reactors the yields of olefins are 
different, the laws of olefin yields that change along with 
operating conditions are uniform. Steam catalytic cracking 
with molecular sieve based catalysts operates at lower tem-
peratures than convention steam cracking, thus providing 
energy savings. It also provides flexibility in terms of feeds 
and can further increase the selectivity to light olefins com-
pared to conventional steam cracking.
