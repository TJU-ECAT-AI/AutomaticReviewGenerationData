Abstract
The objective of this study is to examine the mechanisms and kinetics of C2H6 dehydrogenation and n-C4H10 dehydrogenation and cracking over isolated Ga species in Ga/H-MFI and to compare these results to those reported previously for C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking. C2H6 dehydrogenation is found to be catalyzed by both [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+ cations at similar turnover frequencies. Rate measurements over Ga/H-MFI containing predominantly [GaH2]+ cations reveal that C2H6 dehydrogenation rates exhibit a Langmuir–Hinshelwood dependence on C2H6 partial pressure at elevated temperatures (>730 K), consistent with the involvement of chemisorbed [C2H5–GaH]+ species. The reaction kinetics suggest that C2H6 dehydrogenation proceeds via heterolytic C–H cleavage of adsorbed C2H6 by [GaH2]+ cations to form H2 and [C2H5–GaH]+ species, which further decompose via β-hydride elimination to form C2H4. By contrast, C4H10 dehydrogenation and both terminal and central cracking are catalyzed exclusively by [GaH]2+ cations. All three reactions exhibit a Langmuir–Hinshelwood dependence on C4H10 partial pressure and are inhibited by H2. Ratios of dehydrogenation to cracking (total) and terminal to central cracking are approximately independent of C4H10 partial pressure consistent with the involvement of a common C4H10-derived surface intermediate. The observed reaction kinetics are consistent with an alkyl-mediated mechanism occurring over [GaH]2+, analogous to that reported previously for C3H8 dehydrogenation/cracking over Ga/H-MFI (Phadke, N. M.; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 1614−1627). The mechanism proceeds via facile, heterolytic dissociation of adsorbed C4H10 to form [C4H9–GaH]+–H+ cation pairs via methyl C–H-activated pathways. Dehydrogenation then proceeds via β-hydride elimination, respectively, forming butene, while terminal and central cracking proceed via C–H-activated H+ attack. Methylene activation was also considered but found to occur at a significantly lower rate. Theoretical analysis of the proposed reaction pathways leads to apparent activation enthalpies in good agreement with values extracted from the measured kinetics, thereby supporting the proposed pathways and the roles of [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+ cations in the dehydrogenation and cracking of light alkanes on Ga/H-MFI.

1. Introduction
Increasing demand for light alkenes together with the low cost of C2H6 and C3H8 from the condensable fraction of natural gas and the availability of C4H10 from naphtha have led to growing interest in the conversion of these feed stocks to alkenes and aromatics via dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization, respectively. (1−3) Gallium-exchanged MFI zeolite (Ga/H-MFI) is a particularly active catalyst for these reactions (2,4−7) The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics over Ga/H-MFI is complex and involves an interplay between concurrent dehydrogenation, cracking, oligomerization, hydride transfer, and cyclization all of which may be catalyzed by both Ga species and residual Brønsted acid O–H groups. (2,8) The most energetically demanding step of this sequence is the initial dehydrogenation of the reactant alkanes to their corresponding alkenes and H2. (7) As a consequence, many studies have been devoted to understanding the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-MFI and identifying which extra-framework Ga species are active catalysts for this reaction, as well as alkane cracking, an undesired side reaction. (2,9,10)
Multiple Ga species have been identified in Ga/H-MFI; however, their distribution and catalytic role continues to be a subject of active discussion. (11−19) These studies have shown that the proportions of isolated and proximate cation-exchange sites, and the distance between proximate sites in MFI, together with the catalyst pretreatment conditions affect the structure and distribution of Ga species. (14,15,20−27) A number of Ga structures have been proposed to be catalytically active for alkane dehydrogenation, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga2O2]2, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, Ga+–H+ cation pairs, and Ga2O3 clusters. (7,12−17,19,22,28−30) Defining which structures are most active has been challenging because the conventional protocol for the preparation of Ga/H-MFI, which is based on wet impregnation of H-MFI with Ga(NO3)3 followed by calcination and H2 reduction, produces isolated cationic Ga species, as well GaOx clusters. (2,31)
Ga/H-MFI containing purely isolated Ga3+ species can be produced by vapor-phase exchange of dehydrated H-MFI with GaCl3. (27,32) We have shown that under reducing conditions and the absence of water vapor, [GaH]2+ cations, which are stable at proximate cation-exchange sites with framework Al–Al distances ≤5 Å, form at low Ga/Al ratios and are the predominant species at a Ga/Al ratio of 0.1. Increasing the Ga/Al ratio from 0.1 to 0.3 results in the titration of proximate cation-exchange sites with framework Al–Al distances >5 Å by Ga3+ species as [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs.
We have recently probed the mechanism and kinetics of C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI samples prepared via vapor-phase exchange of H-MFI with GaCl3. (33) We found that C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking are catalyzed exclusively by [GaH]2+ cations at low Ga/Al ratios and that the specific rates (normalized per Altot) at which these reactions proceed are 2 orders and 1 order of magnitude, respectively, higher than the specific rates (normalized per Altot) for the corresponding reactions occurring over Brønsted acid O–H groups. [GaH2]+ cations, which form at Ga/Al ratios >0.1, are inactive for both reactions. Our experimental and theoretical studies suggest that both reactions proceed via facile heterolytic activation of C–H bonds in C3H8 over [GaH]2+ to form [C3H7–GaH]+–H+ cation pairs. The rate-limiting step for the dehydrogenation reaction is β-hydride elimination from [C3H7–GaH]+ to form C3H6 and H2 and restore [GaH]2+, the active site. On the other hand, cracking proceeds via attack of the C–C bond in the [C3H7–GaH]+ fragment by the proximal Brønsted acid O–H group in the [C3H7–GaH]+–H+ cation pair. Selectivity toward either reaction pathway is governed by the difference in the intrinsic free energy barriers between the two pathways.
A number of theoretical studies have examined the mechanism for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over Ga+, [GaH2]+, [GaO]+, [Ga2O2]2+, and [GaH]2+ cations in Ga-exchanged zeolites; however, these studies do not lead to a consensus regarding the relative activity of these species. (13,16−19,29,30,34,35) We have recently reported that [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+ cations are predicted to exhibit similar activity for C2H6 dehydrogenation although the former structure catalyzes the reaction via an alkyl or a carbenium mechanism, whereas the latter structure catalyzes the reaction via a three-step mechanism involving [C2H5–GaH]+ intermediates. (29) Experimental studies of the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over Ga/H-MFI are scarce. Bandiera et al. have reported an activation energy of 39 kcal/mol for C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga/H-MFI prepared by supporting Ga2O3 on H-MFI, whereas Dooley et al. have examined the effects of different catalyst pretreatments and gaseous additives on the rate of C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga/H-MFI. (20,36) However, neither of these studies provided evidence for the presence of isolated Ga species in Ga/H-MFI and did not provide details about the reaction mechanism and kinetics. (36) A recent study by Kosinov et al. (37) posits that Ga+ cations in Ga/H-MFI are responsible for ethane dehydrogenation. We note, though, that in earlier work, [GaH2]+ sites are predicted to form more favorably than Ga+ sites under the reducing environment of ethane dehydrogenation, rendering the relevance of Ga+ sites unlikely for ethane dehydrogenation. (29) While there have also been a number of recent studies investigating the catalytic activity of Ga/H-MFI for ethane dehydrogenation and aromatization, (38−40) these studies have not addressed the nature of the sites on which ethane dehydrogenation occurs. Even fewer studies have been devoted to n-C4H10 dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI. We have shown via theoretical analysis that [GaH]2+ cations are more active for n-C4H10 dehydrogenation than [GaH2]+ cations and that the former structure activates n-C4H10 via an alkyl mechanism, similar to the one reported for C3H8. (29) More recently, Schreiber et al. have reported the rate of n-C4H10 dehydrogenation over Ga/H-MFI to be a factor of 5 lower than the rate of C3H8 dehydrogenation; however, the measured activation energies for the two reactants are similar. (19) The effects of Ga loading, the mechanism by which C4H10 dehydrogenation occurs, and the role of Ga3+ structures in catalyzing the cracking of central and terminal C–C bonds of C4H10 are questions that have not been adequately addressed.
In this study, we report the site requirements, kinetics, and mechanisms for C2H6 dehydrogenation and n-C4H10 dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI prepared via vapor-phase exchange of H-MFI with GaCl3 and compare our findings with those reported earlier for C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking over identical Ga/H-MFI samples. The presence of isolated and well-defined [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+ cations under reducing conditions in these materials enables us to derive a structure–function relationship between the chemical structure of Ga3+ cations and their reactivity toward alkane reactants of varying chain lengths under different reaction conditions. In doing so, we are able to provide insight that will enable rational catalyst design of dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization catalysts containing Ga3+ moieties that are tailored to be reactive for the conversion of a given alkane reactant.
We find that the site requirements for reactions of light alkanes over Ga/H-MFI vary with the carbon chain length of alkane reactants. The dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 and H2 is catalyzed by both [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+ cations with similar turnover frequencies (1.1 × 10–3 mol/(mol Ga·s) at 2 kPa C2H6 and 753 K). The reaction kinetics are consistent with the occurrence of a four-step alkyl-mediated mechanism for C2H6 dehydrogenation over [GaH2]+ cations, a finding that is well supported by theoretical calculations. By contrast, the dehydrogenation, terminal, and central cracking of n-C4H10 are catalyzed exclusively by [GaH]2+ cations in Ga/H-MFI at turnover frequencies that are 3 orders, 2 orders, and 1 order of magnitude higher than the corresponding turnover frequencies of these reactions over H-MFI under identical conditions. [GaH2]+ cations are inactive for alkanes with a carbon chain length greater than 2 due to the considerable entropic penalties associated with the transition state for the initial C–H activation step. Our analysis of the reaction kinetics and theoretical predictions suggests that all three reactions of C4H10 proceed over [GaH]2+ via the formation of alkyl-activated [n-C4H9–GaH]+–H+ species with a mechanism that is analogous to the alkyl mechanism for C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI. (33) Terminal cracking is favored over central cracking, via methyl C–H activation of C4H10 over [GaH]2+ cations.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Preparation of H-MFI and Ga/H-MFI Samples
NH4-MFI (Zeolyst, CBV 3024E) was converted to its H-form by placing 1–2 g of zeolite in quartz calcination boats, which were then heated at 2 K/min from ambient temperature to 773 K, and held at this temperature for 4 h. All steps were conducted in a stream of dry air (Praxair, Ultra Zero) flowing at 100 cm3/min. The Si/Al ratio of this sample was measured to be 16.5 ± 1.0 based on inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (Galbraith Laboratories, Knoxville, TN). Ga/H-MFI samples (Ga/Al = 0.05–0.5) were prepared using the vapor-phase exchange of Brønsted acid O–H groups in H-MFI with GaCl3 vapor. The detailed synthetic protocol used is described in ref (27).
2.2. Reaction Rate Measurements
Reactions of C2H6 and n-C4H10 were investigated using a quartz flow reactor (30.5 cm in length and 0.64 cm in outer diameter). For reactions of C2H6, catalyst charges (typically ∼20 mg) were placed on a quartz wool plug fitted at a pinch inside the quartz reactor. For reactions of n-C4H10, a small amount of catalyst was used (∼4 mg) to attain C4H10 conversions of less than 4%, and the catalyst charge was diluted with inert SiO2 (SiliaFlash 150A, ∼14–16 mg). The temperature of the catalyst bed was monitored by a K-type thermocouple (Omega) connected to a temperature controller (Omega). The quartz reactor was heated by means of a cylindrical ceramic furnace. The flowrate of gases fed to the reactor was measured using mass flow controllers (Porter).
Prior to measuring reaction rates, the catalyst bed was heated at 5 K/min from ambient temperatures to 773 K in a stream of flowing dry air (Praxair, Ultra Zero, 100 cm3/min) and held at this temperature for 1 h. The reactor was then purged with He (Praxair, UHP, 100 cm3/min) for 5 min after which the flow was switched to a stream of 2.5% H2/He (Praxair, CSG, 100 cm3/min). The catalyst bed was exposed to H2/He for 1 h to convert oxidized Ga3+ species into catalytically active GaHx species. (27,33)
Following reduction, the catalyst bed was exposed to mixtures of pure C2H6 (99.999% purity, Matheson) or n-C4H10 (99.999% purity, Matheson) diluted in He to attain alkane partial pressures of 0.5–14 kPa. Experiments involving co-fed H2 were conducted by diluting the alkane/He feed with a stream of 2.5% H2/He (Praxair, CSG). Reactions were conducted under a differential conversion (<9% product conversion). In the case of n-C4H10 reactions, reactant conversions were maintained below 4% to avoid extensive catalyst deactivation, and the rate of dehydrogenation was determined on the basis of the sum of the concentrations of butene isomer products (1-butene, cis-, trans-2-butene, isobutene), whereas the rates of cracking were estimated on the basis of the concentration of alkane products produced during cracking (e.g., for C4H10, C2H6 is a proxy for the rate of central cracking and CH4, for terminal cracking). Reactions rates were fitted to Langmuir–Hinshelwood models using a nonlinear least squares regression. Activation enthalpies were derived from rate coefficients measured at different reaction temperatures and the application of equations derived from transition state theory. (33,41)
Measurements of reaction rates were also conducted as a function of space time (defined as mol Altot·s/mol alkane) to assess the effects of product inhibition and secondary reactions on the rates of primary reactions. Rates were extrapolated to zero space time to eliminate these effects. Deactivation did not exceed 10% in typical runs and was corrected by periodically measuring reaction rates at a reference condition (2 kPa C2H6/He, τ = 7.0 mol Altot·s/mol C2H6 for C2H6 reactions and 0.9 kPa C4H10/He, τ = 3.5 mol Altot·s/mol C4H10 for n-C4H10 reactions). Products of the reactions were conveyed to a sampling loop via a heated transfer line and analyzed periodically by gas chromatography (Agilent 7890A). Reactants and products were separated by a capillary column (Agilent 1909IP-Q02, 25 m × 350 μm × 10 μm) and were detected and quantified using a flame ionization detector (FID). Response factors for the FID were estimated by measuring the detector response for the known concentrations of hydrocarbons.
2.3. Theoretical Component
A quantum mechanic/molecular mechanic (QM/MM) (42,43) approach was used for the theoretical component of this work. (44) A T437 atom cluster was used to represent the zeolite framework surrounding the active site. The QM region was modeled using a fully relaxed T9 cluster and the T428 atom MM region in which the framework Si and O atoms were fixed at their crystallographic positions. The framework Al atom associated with extra-framework Ga cationic species is taken to be at the T12 site, which is situated at the channel intersections of MFI. (45) Only a small difference (2.6 kcal/mol) was found in the calculated barriers for ethene methylation over H-MFI calculated for both T5 and T20 clusters, (46) which suggests that our QM/MM approach is not influenced significantly by the size of the QM region used. An illustration of the model used for the [GaH]2+ cation in this study is shown in Figure S17.
For the QM region, geometry optimizations and transition state searches were conducted at the ωB97X-D/6-31G** level of theory using the default optimization procedure available in QChem. (47) Reported energies were computed using the ωB97X-D functional (48) with the triple-ζ, split-valence Pople basis set, with diffuse and polarization functions 6-311++G(3df,3pd). Although statistically improved accuracy (49,50) relative to the ωB97X-D functional has been demonstrated for more recent density functional theory (DFT) functionals, the force field parameters used for the atoms in the MM region were developed specifically for the ωB97X-D functional. (51) The quasi rigid rotor harmonic oscillator (RRHO) approximation was used to predict enthalpic and free energies, which were analyzed using the energetic span model proposed by Kozuch and Shaik. (52−55) Free energy and enthalpy landscapes for butane dehydrogenation, terminal, and central cracking, which are catalyzed by methyl activation and methylene C–H activation are illustrated in the Supporting Information.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Effects of the Ga Content on the Rate of C2H6 Dehydrogenation
The reaction of C2H6 over H-MFI and Ga/H-MFI leads to the formation of C2H4 and H2 via dehydrogenation. Under the conditions prevalent during our measurements (conversions <1%), C2H4 was the only product detected. Over Ga/H-MFI for higher conversions and partial pressures of C2H6, only trace concentrations of CH4 and C3H6 were detected, suggesting that these products form via secondary pathways.
Figure 1a shows the dependence of the rate of C2H6 dehydrogenation (at 2 kPa C2H6 and 753 K) normalized per Altot atom on the Ga/Al ratio for a range of Ga/Al ratios (Ga/Al = 0–0.5). These rates were extrapolated to zero space time to account for the effects of product inhibition by C2H4 and H2 on C2H6 dehydrogenation rates measured at finite space times (see Section S.4). The linear increase in the rate of C2H6 dehydrogenation with increasing Ga/Al ratio suggests that the activity of Ga sites is independent of the Ga/Al ratio. At the highest Ga/Al ratio of 0.5, the rate of C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga/H-MFI is about 11 times higher than the corresponding rate (per Altot) measured over H-MFI under similar conditions (Figure S1). The C2H6 dehydrogenation rate normalized per Ga atom (after subtracting the rate contributed per Altot over H-MFI) is shown in Figure 1b. The independence of the rate on the Ga/Al ratio suggests that all Ga3+ structures are equally active.

(a) Turnover frequencies for C2H6 dehydrogenation (normalized per Altot atom) as a function of the Ga/Al ratio and (b) turnover frequencies for C2H6 dehydrogenation (normalized per Ga atom) as a function of the Ga/Al ratio. Rates were measured at 2 kPa C2H6/He at 753 K and extrapolated to zero space time. Solid lines are guidelines for the eye. Samples were reduced in H2 at 773 K for 1 h prior to the measurement of reaction rates.
Characterization of the Ga/H-MFI samples used in this study has shown that for Ga/Al ratios ≤0.3, Ga species are present as isolated cationic species. (27) In the H2-reduced state, [GaH]2+ cations are the predominant active species for Ga/Al < 0.1 and that for 0.1 < Ga/Al < 0.3, [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs form in increasing Ga concentration. (27) Both structures require the presence of proximate cation-exchange sites. (27) The monotonic increase in C2H6 dehydrogenation rates as a function of the Ga/Al ratio seen in Figure 1a suggests that [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs present in these samples exhibit virtually identical activity.
In the oxidized state, an increase in the Ga content of Ga/H-MFI such that Ga/Al > 0.3 leads to saturation of proximate cation-exchange sites and the concomitant formation of neutral GaOx oligomers. (27)Figure 1a,b also shows Ga/H-MFI samples that contain Ga in excess of the saturation stoichiometry of the proximate cation-exchange sites (i.e., for Ga/Al = 0.5); the catalyst continues to be active for C2H6 dehydrogenation at a rate per Ga that is similar to that for Ga sites present in Ga/H-MFI with Ga/Al < 0.3. This finding suggests that either GaOx oligomers that are present in the Ga/Al = 0.5 sample are as active as cationic GaHx species or that reduction in H2 prior to reaction transforms these neutral clusters into cationic GaHx species. Since Dooley et al. have shown that GaOx agglomerates in Ga/H-MFI catalysts are much less active for C2H6 dehydrogenation than cationic Ga species, (20) the higher catalytic activity of the Ga/Al = 0.5 sample is less likely due to GaOx agglomerates but more likely due to the formation of additional cationic GaHx species in these samples. In agreement with this proposal, we find that the exchange stoichiometry of the Ga/Al = 0.5 sample increases from 0.55 H+ exchanged per Ga atom for the catalyst in the oxidized state to 0.84 H+ exchanged per Ga atom upon H2-reduction (measured using NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)). This increase in the fraction of exchanged Brønsted acid O–H groups and the resulting near-unity exchange stoichiometry ([GaH2]+ is expected to have an exchange stoichiometry of 1 Hexch+ per Ga) is consistent with the re-dispersion of GaOx agglomerates as [GaH2]+ cations located at residual isolated cation-exchange sites in the Ga/Al = 0.5 sample. Therefore, a linear increase in catalytic activity with the Ga/Al ratio is a result of the increase in the concentration of [GaH2]+ cations with the Ga content, which are identical in activity whether they are present at isolated cation-exchange sites or at cation-exchange sites that are proximate. These site requirements for C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga/H-MFI vary markedly from those for C3H8 dehydrogenation (33) or n-C4H10 dehydrogenation (see Section 3.4 and beyond), both of which are catalyzed exclusively by [GaH]2+ cations present in Ga/H-MFI at Ga/Al ratios below 0.3. The identical activity of [GaH]2+ cations and [GaH2]+ cations for C2H6 dehydrogenation is supported by theoretical calculations reported by Mansoor et al., which predict similar apparent free energy activation barriers for C2H6 dehydrogenation over both structures. (29)
3.2. Effects of C2H6 Partial Pressure and Temperature on C2H6 Dehydrogenation over Ga/H-MFI
The effects of C2H6 partial pressure on C2H6 dehydrogenation turnover rates (normalized per Ga atom) are shown in Figure 2 for three different temperatures—733, 753, and 773 K. Rates measured at finite space times were extrapolated to zero space time to mitigate the effects of product inhibition on measured kinetics. At low partial pressures, dehydrogenation rates approach a first-order dependence on C2H6 partial pressure, while at high partial pressures, these rates approach a zero-order dependence on C2H6 partial pressure. A Langmuir–Hinshelwood dependence of C2H6 dehydrogenation rates on reactant partial pressure is observed for all three temperatures in Figure 2. The change in reaction order as a function of partial pressure implies the involvement of strongly bound C2H6 reactive intermediates that saturate active sites at sufficiently high partial pressures, resulting in the observed zero-order rate dependences.

Reported rates were extrapolated to zero space time. Solid lines indicate fits of data to eq 1 via nonlinear, least squares regression.
The rate data shown in Figure 2 can be fit to a rate equation of the functional form given by eq 1.

In eq 1, the dehydrogenation rate has units of mol/(mol Ga·s). The parameter αe (which has units of mol/(mol Ga·s·bar)) and βe (which has units of bar–1) are empirical parameters. As discussed below, both parameters can be interpreted in terms of equilibrium constants and rate coefficients for elementary steps involved in the dehydrogenation of C2H6(Table 1).

3.3. Mechanistic Analysis of C2H6 Dehydrogenation over [GaH2]+ Cations
NH3-TPD was used to estimate the concentrations of different Ga3+ species in the Ga/Al = 0.5 sample. (27,33) By this means, we find that only 20% of the total Ga in this sample is present as [GaH]2+, whereas the remaining 80% is present as [GaH2]+. Consequently, the rates of C2H6 dehydrogenation measured over this Ga/H-MFI sample (Ga/Al = 0.5) predominantly reflect the activity of [GaH2]+ cations. Below, we propose a mechanism for C2H6 dehydrogenation over [GaH2]+ cations and present a theoretical analysis to support it. We also discuss the extent to which the rate of C2H6 dehydrogenation over [GaH]2+ differs from that over [GaH2]+.
The role of [GaH2]+ cations in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 has been described using the four-step alkyl mechanism in theoretical studies by Frash et al., Joshi et al., Pereira et al., and more recently by Mansoor et al. (13,17,29,34) The steps in this mechanism and the associated activation barriers are shown in Scheme 1. The first step represents the adsorption of C2H6 at a [GaH2]+ via weak physisorption (ΔHads = −7.2 kcal/mol). The second step involves the insertion of the Ga3+ center in the C–H bond of adsorbed C2H6 leading to C–H cleavage and the formation of [C2H5–GaH2]+ species while the H+ removed during C–H cleavage migrates to a nearby framework O atom. This step is predicted to have an activation enthalpy of 27.5 kcal/mol (see ref (30) and Section S.6). The third step is an almost barrier-less recombination of a Ga-bound hydride and the proximal H+ to form H2. The final step of the sequence involves β-hydride elimination from the alkyl fragment, resulting in the formation of surface-bound C2H4 and [GaH2]+. This step has an activation enthalpy of 42.4 kcal/mol (see ref (30) and Section S.6).
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Proposed Alkyl Mechanism for C2H6 Dehydrogenation over [GaH2]+ Cationsa
aThe enthalpies reported in ref (30) have been corrected to 753 K, the temperatures at which the present experimental work were carried out. Activation enthalpies are denoted as ΔH‡.
The elementary steps shown in Scheme 1 can be used to derive a rate law for C2H6 dehydrogenation over [GaH2]+ cations (see Section S.5 for a full derivation), shown here as eq 2.
(2)
In eq 2, k2 is the rate coefficient for the C–H cleavage of adsorbed C2H6 in step 2, K1 is the equilibrium adsorption constant for C2H6 physisorption at [GaH2]+ cations in step 1, k4 is the rate coefficient for β-hydride elimination/C2H4 formation from [C2H5–GaH]+ species in step 4, and [L] is the total number of [GaH2]+ sites supported on MFI.
As discussed in greater detail in Section S.5 of the Supporting Information, the second term in the denominator of eq 2 (i.e., k2(K1/k4)[C2H6]) reflects the steady-state surface concentration of [C2H5–GaH]+. If the free energy of barrier for β-hydride elimination is much lower than the free energy barrier for initial C–H cleavage, i.e., k2K1/k4 ≪ 1, the second term in the denominator of eq 2 becomes insignificant. If this were to be true, eq 2 predicts that the dehydrogenation rate would be first-order in C2H6 for all reaction conditions and consequently the rate-determining step would be step 2 of Scheme 1.
To understand if this is the case, we examined the Gibbs free energy barriers for steps 2 and 4, predicted theoretically. (29) These energies were previously reported at 823 K and therefore had to be recalculated at 753 K (Section S.6), the temperature used for most of our experiments. Inspection of Gibbs free energy barriers for these steps at 753 K reveals that step 2 has the highest free energy of activation (59.4 kcal/mol with respect to gas-phase C2H6). Step 4 of the sequence, i.e., the β-hydride elimination/C2H4 formation step also has a relatively high Gibbs free energy of activation (42.5 kcal/mol with respect to [C2H5–GaH]+ species), but this value is lower than the free energy of activation for step 2. It is noteworthy that the predicted intrinsic activation enthalpy for step 4 is actually 17.8 kcal/mol higher than the predicted apparent activation enthalpy for step 2 (see Scheme 1). The opposite trend observed for the Gibbs free energy barriers of these steps has been attributed to entropic differences between the transition states for these two reactions. (29) Since the Gibbs free energy of activation for step 4 is not substantially lower than the Gibbs free energy of activation for step 2, it is apparent that the term k2K1/k4 in eq 2 may become significant at sufficiently high C2H6 pressures.
Comparison of eqs 1 and 2 indicates that the first-order rate coefficient αe in eq 1 corresponds to the term k2K1 in eq 2 and that βe corresponds to k2K1/k4. Table 2 lists the apparent activation enthalpy for αe (k2K1), and the activation enthalpy for βe (k4) determined from the data presented in Table 1 (see Section S.7 for details). Also shown are the theoretical values for these activation enthalpies reported in ref (30) and corrected here to 753 K.

The apparent activation enthalpy determined experimentally from an Arrhenius plot of k2K1(αe) is 25.5 ± 4.7 kcal/mol. This value is in good agreement with the theoretically predicted difference between the transition state for step 2 relative to gas-phase C2H6 (27.5 kcal/mol). Similarly, the experimental activation enthalpy extracted from values of k4 is 35.9 ± 3.5 kcal/mol, a value that is similar but slightly lower than the enthalpy difference between the transition state for step 4 relative to [C2H5–GaH]+ species (45.3 kcal/mol). We note that our theoretical studies only examined the properties of [GaH2]+ located at the T12 site in MFI. Consequently, it is possible that [GaH2]+ cations located at other cation-exchange sites in MFI could have lower activation barriers than the site considered for this study.
3.4. Steady-State Reactions of n-C4H10 over Ga/H-MFI (Ga/Al = 0.2)
Figure 3a illustrates the rate of n-C4H10 consumption over Ga/H-MFI (Ga/Al = 0.2) measured at a partial pressure of 0.9 kPa C4H10 in He, a space time of 3.5 mol Al·s/mol C4H10, and a temperature of 718 K. Figure 3b,c shows the steady-state product selectivities (reported as the fraction of converted C appearing in products) as a function of time-on-stream. Under the conditions employed, the conversion is <4% and C4 species account for 80% of the butane converted in the form of 1-butene, trans- and cis-2-butene, isobutene, and a small fraction of isobutane. C3H6 (∼11%) and C2H4 (∼6%) constitute the other major products. In addition to these species, CH4, C2H6, and aromatic products are formed in low concentrations. This product distribution varies markedly from that for n-C4H10 conversion over H-MFI (see Table S2), which consists of similar proportions of CH4, C3H6, C2H4, C2H6, and C4H8. It is also apparent from space-time studies (Figure S6) that among the C4 products, the selectivity toward 1-butene and trans-2-butene is significantly higher than selectivity to cis-2-butene and isobutene. In addition, with increasing space time, the selectivity to 1-butene and trans-2-butene decreases while the selectivity to cis-2-butene and isobutene increases. These observations suggest that 1-butene and trans-2-butene are formed as primary products during C4H10 dehydrogenation over Ga/H-MFI.

Turnover frequencies for (a) n-C4H10 conversion (normalized per Altot atom), (b) carbon selectivity to C4 products, and (c) carbon selectivity to remaining products, measured at τ = 3.5 (mol Al·s/mol C4H10), 0.9 kPa C4H10/He, and 718 K over Ga/H-MFI (Ga/Al = 0.2) for n-C4H10 conversions <4%. Ga/H-MFI samples were prereduced in H2 at 773 K for 0.5 h prior to reaction.
The primary processes for the reaction of n-C4H10 over H-MFI and Ga/H-MFI are C4H10 dehydrogenation to produce butenes and H2, central cracking of C4H10 to produce C2H4 and C2H6, and terminal cracking of C4H10 to produce CH4 and C3H6. In the absence of secondary reactions involving any of the above products, an equimolar yield of each product pair is expected for each reaction pathway. At finite space times, measured product molar ratios of H2/C4H8, C3H6/CH4, and C2H4/C2H6 over Ga/H-MFI (Ga/Al = 0.2) are all greater than unity (see Figure S5), indicating the occurrence of secondary reactions even at low conversions (<4%). However, when the reaction rates are extrapolated to zero space time (Figure S4), all three product molar ratios approach unity. This suggests that the rates of the three primary reactions can be extracted from rate data extrapolated to zero space time. The increase in the ratios of C3H6/CH4 and C2H4/C2H6 with increasing space time suggests that C2 and C4 alkene products can also form via secondary pathways, such as the cracking of primary butene products. (56) To mitigate the effects of product inhibition and secondary reactions, all reported rates in the following sections were extrapolated to zero space time. This procedure also allows us to measure the rates of 1- and 2-butene formation and avoid the formation of isobutene, since the effects of butane isomerization catalyzed by Brønsted acidic O–H groups is minimized. (4,57)
3.5. Effects of the Ga/Al Ratio on the Rates of n-C4H10 Dehydrogenation and Cracking
The effects of the Ga content on the rates of n-C4H10 dehydrogenation, terminal, and central cracking are shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. The rates of dehydrogenation and both terminal and central cracking normalized per Altot atom increase with the Ga content up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.1, beyond which these rates are essentially independent of the Ga content. At their maximum, the rate of n-C4H10 dehydrogenation (normalized per Altot) over Ga/H-MFI is 180 times greater than the corresponding dehydrogenation rate over H-MFI, while the rate of n-C4H10 terminal cracking and n-C4H10 central cracking (both normalized per Altot) are 15 and 5 times higher, respectively, than the corresponding rates over H-MFI under identical experimental conditions. This indicates that residual Brønsted acid O–H groups in Ga/H-MFI have a negligible effect on dehydrogenation and terminal cracking but could be significant for central cracking. While the dehydrogenation to cracking rate ratio (D/C) is close to unity over H-MFI, this ratio is approximately 10 over Ga/H-MFI. Similarly, the terminal to central cracking rate ratio over H-MFI is close to unity, but this ratio is approximately 3 over Ga/H-MFI. Therefore, Ga/H-MFI is significantly more selective for dehydrogenation relative to cracking and more selective for terminal cracking relative to central cracking than H-MFI. Elucidation of these selectivity differences requires identification of the kinetically relevant Ga3+ species for these reaction pathways.

Rates were measured at 0.9 kPa C4H10/He at 718 K and extrapolated to zero space time. [GaH]2+ site densities were estimated by NH3-TPD. (27) Solid lines are guides for the eye.
The similarity in the trends for dehydrogenation and cracking as a function of the Ga/Al ratio seen in Figures 4a and 5a suggests that identical active sites catalyze all three reactions. Since the rates of all three reactions depend on the Ga content only at low Ga/Al ratios, it is conceivable that [GaH]2+ cations, which are predominant in Ga/H-MFI at low Ga/Al ratios (Ga/Al ≤ 0.1), (27) are the active sites for n-C4H10 dehydrogenation, terminal and central cracking. Shown in Figures 4b and 5b are the rates of these reactions normalized by the density of [GaH]2+ cations estimated from NH3-TPD. (27) It is observed that the rates of all three reactions are approximately independent of the Ga/Al ratio when normalized by the concentration of [GaH]2+ cations. Thus, [GaH]2+ cations appear to be the sole active species for reactions of n-C4H10, analogous to the findings for C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI. (33) [GaH2]+ cations that form in increasing concentration in Ga/H-MFI with Ga/Al ratios >0.1 do not appear to contribute to measured rates. Consequently, turnover frequencies over Ga/H-MFI (normalized per [GaH]2+) for dehydrogenation, terminal, and central cracking are 3 orders, 2 orders, and 1 order of magnitude, respectively, higher than the turnover frequencies of these reactions over H-MFI (normalized per H+). These findings are in stark contrast to the trends observed for C2H6 dehydrogenation, for which both [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+ cations are active sites.
3.6. Effects of n-C4H10 Partial Pressure and Temperature on the Rates of n-C4H10 Dehydrogenation and Cracking over Ga/H-MFI
The effects of C4H10 partial pressure on turnover rates (per [GaH]2+) for dehydrogenation, terminal, and central cracking at 718 K are shown in Figure 6a,b. All three reactions exhibit a Langmuir–Hinshelwood dependence on C4H10 partial pressure—the rates are first order in C4H10 at low partial pressures but decrease to less than first order at higher C4H10 partial pressures. Similar dependences of rates on C4H10 partial pressure were also observed at two other reaction temperatures (see Section S.11). These observations are analogous to those observed for C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI (33) for which the formation of chemisorbed alkyl–Ga intermediates upon dissociation of propane by [GaH]2+ species was found to lead to a Langmuir–Hinshelwood dependence of rates on the propane partial pressure.

Rates were extrapolated to zero space time and are normalized per mol of [GaH]2+. Solid lines reflect fits of the data to eqs 3–5 via nonlinear, least squares regression.
The similar site requirements and similar effects of reactant and product partial pressure on the rate of C4H10 dehydrogenation and both terminal and central cracking suggest that these reactions proceed via a common C4H10-derived intermediate. If this is the case, the ratios of the rates of dehydrogenation to cracking (terminal + central) (D/C) and terminal to central cracking (Ct/Cc) should bear the same dependence on the C4H10 surface coverage and should therefore be approximately independent of C4H10 and H2 partial pressures. As observed in Figure 6c, D/C and Ct/Cc rate ratios are only weakly dependent on C4H10 partial pressure, suggesting that all three reactions likely proceed via a common C4H10-derived surface intermediate. We note that both ratios appear to decrease slightly with increasing C4H10 partial pressure, but this dependence becomes weaker with decreasing temperature (see Section S.11).
The observations presented above suggest that the effects of C4H10 partial pressure on the D/C ratio and Ct/Cc ratio could arise from the contributions of residual Brønsted acid O–H groups to the measured cracking rates at high C4H10 partial pressures. As noted in Section 3.5, the rate of central cracking over Ga/H-MFI (Ga/Al = 0.2) is only a factor of 5 higher than the corresponding rate over H-MFI at 0.9 kPa C4H10 and 718 K. Central cracking catalyzed by Brønsted acid O–H groups has a first-order dependence on C4H10 partial pressure (see Section S.12), while the same reaction catalyzed by [GaH]2+ is expected to reach a zero-order dependence on C4H10 partial pressure at high C4H10 partial pressure. Since the Ga/H-MFI sample used for the present experiments has 34% fewer Brønsted acid O–H groups than H-MFI (based on the characterization of H2-reduced Ga/H-MFI samples by NH3-TPD (27)), we can correct the first-order rate coefficient (per Altot atom) for central cracking over H-MFI by a factor of 0.66. The resulting analysis shows that at 10 kPa C4H10, the rate of central cracking (normalized per Altot atom) over Ga/H-MFI (Ga/Al = 0.2) will only be 1.35 times higher than the central cracking rate (normalized per Altot atom) over H-MFI. Thus, with an increase in C4H10 partial pressure, residual Brønsted acid O–H groups in Ga/H-MFI could have a non-negligible contribution to central cracking.
An attempt was made to correct the rate of central cracking over Ga/H-MFI for contributions from protolytic central cracking reactions by subtracting the rate of central cracking over H-MFI (estimated using the measured first-order rate coefficient over H-MFI) from the rate of central cracking over Ga/H-MFI (see Figure S13). The resulting D/C ratios are independent of C4H10 partial pressure; Ct/Cc ratios are nearly independent of C4H10 partial pressure but show a nonsystematic increase at high C4H10 partial pressures (>8 kPa C4H10). This nonsystematic variation may be caused by small (15–20%) differences between the actual central cracking rate coefficient over residual Brønsted acid O–H groups in Ga/H-MFI and the measured central cracking rate coefficient over H-MFI that was used for the rate subtraction process. Previous work by our group has shown that the selectivity to central cracking relative to terminal cracking for protolytic C4H10 cracking over H-MFI is sensitive to the location of Brønsted acid O–H groups in H-MFI. (5) In Ga/H-MFI, the locations of residual Brønsted acid O–H groups (in the case of the H2-reduced Ga/Al = 0.2 sample, 66% of the total H+ initially present in H-MFI) are not known. Consequently, the intrinsic reactivity of these residual Brønsted acid O–H groups for central cracking may be slightly different from that of the average of all of the Brønsted acid O–H groups initially present in H-MFI. As a result, we cannot reliably use cracking rate coefficients measured over H-MFI to correct central cracking rates over Ga/H-MFI for protolytic contributions. Nonetheless, these corrections provide a qualitative explanation for the weak effects of C4H10 pressure on D/C and Ct/Cc ratios in Figure 6c and support the conclusion that in the absence of such effects, both ratios are approximately independent of C4H10 partial pressure, suggesting the prevalence of a common C4H10-derived surface intermediate for all three reactions.
Additionally, even though dehydrogenation, terminal, and central cracking are inhibited by H2, D/C and Ct/Cc ratios are independent of the H2 partial pressure (see Figure S10) consistent with the hypothesis that a common surface intermediate is involved in all three reactions, the formation of which is inhibited in the presence of H2. As noted previously, D/C and Ct/Cc ratios measured at two lower temperatures (see Figure S10) decrease more weakly with C4H10 partial pressure than data taken at 718 K and shown in Figure 6c. This is expected if [GaH]2+-catalyzed cracking has much lower activation energy than protolytic cracking, as was found for C3H8 cracking over Ga/H-MFI and H-MFI. (33) Consequently, contributions from protolytic central cracking are expected to be less significant for the two lower temperatures (see Figure S11), and, therefore, the contribution from protolytic central cracking is not expected to significantly influence our experimentally measured estimate of the activation energy for central cracking over Ga/H-MFI.
The rate data presented in Figure 6a,b can be fit to eqs 3–5. These empirical rate expressions contain parameters αd, αt, and αc for dehydrogenation, terminal cracking, and central cracking, respectively, and a parameter β common to all three equations. Inspection of eqs 3–5 indicates that αd, αt, and αc reflect first-order rate coefficients with units of mol/(mol [GaH]2+·s·bar) for dehydrogenation, terminal, and central cracking respectively. The parameter β has units of bar–1. At very high C4H10 partial pressures, for which the rates of dehydrogenation, terminal, and central cracking approach zero-order dependence on C4H10, the parameters αd/β, αt/β, and αc/β represent zero-order rate coefficients with units of mol/(mol [GaH]2+·s).

3.7. Mechanisms of C4H10 Dehydrogenation and Both Terminal and Central Cracking Catalyzed by [GaH]2+
The findings reported in Sections 3.5 and 3.6 suggest that [GaH]2+ cations catalyze C4H10 dehydrogenation and both terminal and central cracking. We propose that these reactions proceed via mechanisms analogous to the alkyl mechanism for C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking. (33) By analogy with that study, the adsorption of C4H10 is envisioned to form [n-C4H9–GaH]+–H+ cation pairs, via methyl C–H activation, and [sec-C4H9–GaH]+–H+ cation pairs, via methylene C–H activation. Also, by analogy with our work on C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking, we envision that these alkyl–Ga species are intermediates for the dehydrogenation and cracking of C4H10.
Scheme 2 shows the proposed elementary steps for n-C4H10 dehydrogenation and for terminal and central cracking over [GaH]2+ cations. The first two steps of the sequence are common to all three reaction pathways. Step 1 involves physisorption of n-C4H10 at [GaH]2+ to form a physisorbed alkane–[GaH]2+ complex. Step 2 involves heterolytic dissociation of primary and secondary C–H bonds in C4H10 and the concomitant formation of [n-C4H9–GaH]+–H+ and [sec-C4H9–GaH]+–H+ cation pairs. Dehydrogenation and cracking pathways can branch from these alkyl intermediates, as illustrated in Scheme 2. Here, the “*” superscript is used to denote methylene-activated pathways, so as to distinguish them from methyl-activated pathways.

Methyl dehydrogenation (step 3d in Scheme 2) proceeds via β-hydride elimination of the alkyl fragment to produce butene and H2 in a concerted fashion. This process involves a cyclic transition state, which produces 1-butene and H2 if the methyl C–H bonds undergo β-hydride elimination and 2-butene and H2 if methyl C–H bonds undergo β-hydride elimination. Terminal cracking proceeds via attack of the terminal C–C bonds in the [n-C4H9–GaH]+ cation by the proximal Brønsted acid O–H group (step 3t in sequence 2), leading to the formation of C3H6, CH4, and the [GaH]2+ site. Central cracking proceeds via the C–C bond attack of the central C–C bond by the proximal Brønsted acid O–H group (step 3c in Scheme 2), resulting in the formation C2H4 and C2H6. No transition state structures were observed for central cracking via methylene activation; however, transition states for both methylene C–H activated dehydrogenation (step 3d* in Scheme 2) and terminal cracking (step 3t* in Scheme 2) were found (see Figures S17–S22).
Our analysis of the free energy and enthalpy profiles for the dehydrogenation and cracking of C4H10 are shown in Figures S18–S22. The results presented in Figures S18–S20 show that for methyl activation, steps 1 and 2 of Scheme 2 are quasi-equilibrated and that steps 3d, 3t, and 3c are rate-limiting for dehydrogenation, terminal cracking, and central cracking, respectively. By contrast, Figures S21 and S22 show that for methylene activation, only step 1 is quasi-equilibrated and that steps 2*, 3d*, and 3t* may contribute to the determination of the rates of dehydrogenation and terminal cracking, respectively. We note that a transition state activated via methylene C–H cleavage could not be found for central cracking. Comparison of Figures S18–S20 and Figures S21 and S22 leads to the conclusion that the rates of dehydrogenation and cracking via the methyl-activated pathway should be about 30 times higher at 718 K than those via the methylene-activated pathway. For this reason, we exclude the methylene pathway from further consideration.
The elementary steps shown in Scheme 2 can be used to derive rate expressions for each of the three pathways, shown here as eqs 6, 7, and 8 for dehydrogenation, terminal and central cracking, respectively. Rate equations for terminal and central cracking from the two intermediate species were also lumped into a single term for terminal and central cracking (see Section S.14 for derivation).

In eqs 6–8, kd is the rate coefficient for β-hydride elimination, a step which is predicted to be rate determining for dehydrogenation, kt is the rate coefficient for C–C bond attack by H+ leading to terminal cracking, and kc is the rate coefficient for C–C bond attack by H+ leading to central cracking. The parameters K1 and K2 represent the equilibrium constants for n-C4H10 physisorption at [GaH]2+ and the formation of [C4H9–GaH]+–H+ cation pairs, respectively. A comparison of eqs 6–8 with eqs 3–5 shows that the first-order rate coefficients αd, αt, and αc correspond to the terms kdK2K1, ktK2K1, and kcK2K1, respectively, for methyl-activated pathways. The parameter β corresponds to the equilibrium constant product, K2K10. Consequently, the zero-order rate parameters αd/β, αt/β, and αc/β correspond to the rate coefficients kd, kt, and kc, respectively.
Apparent activation enthalpies for each of the three reaction pathways were obtained from Arrhenius plots of the apparent rate coefficients, which were determined by fitting eqs 3–5 to rate data measured over Ga/H-MFI (Ga/Al = 0.2) at different temperatures (see Section S.15). The resulting apparent activation enthalpies for the three reactions are listed in Table 3. Also shown are theoretical predictions for the apparent activation enthalpies for C4H10 dehydrogenation catalyzed via [C4H9–GaH]+ species. We observe that for dehydrogenation, the theoretically predicted values (23.4 and 19.7 kcal/mol) are in good agreement with the experimentally determined apparent activation enthalpy (17.5 ± 4.7 kcal/mol).

bObtained via fitting of rate coefficients of data in Figures 6a,b, S11.1, and S11.2 to eqs 3, 4, and 5. Arrhenius plots are included in Section S15.
Table 3 shows that the measured apparent activation enthalpy for central cracking is 3.1 kcal/mol lower than the corresponding activation enthalpy for terminal cracking. The corresponding theoretically predicted estimates follow the same trend. The magnitude of the theoretically predicted terminal cracking barrier is higher than the one predicted for central cracking by 7.5 kcal/mol. Additionally, we note the possibility that meta stable cracking intermediates derived from methyl-activated butyl-Ga-hydrides may exist after the terminal cracking transition state (TS2 in Figure S19); however, as the magnitude of the calculated barriers associated with the transition state following the RDTS (TS2 in Figure S19) is lower than that of the RDTS, the results reported in Table 3 are not affected by this finding. Furthermore, it should be noted that an additional proton hopping step is involved in the mechanism for methyl-activated central cracking after the first C–H activation, which is noted in Figure S20 but not explicitly mentioned in Scheme 2.
3.8. Mechanistic Similarities and Differences between the Reactions of C2H6, C3H8, and n-C4H10 over Ga/H-MFI
The findings presented in this study reveal that there are significant effects of alkane chain length on the activity of isolated [GaHx](3–x)+ cations in Ga/H-MFI. First, the site requirements for dehydrogenation reactions appear to vary significantly as a function of alkane chain length. Both [GaH]2+ cations and [GaH2]+ cations catalyze C2H6 dehydrogenation with similar activity. While the former species require the presence of proximate cation-exchange sites with framework Al–Al distances ≤5 Å apart, (27) the latter structure can form at all cation-exchange sites in MFI. This results in the observed proportionality of C2H6 dehydrogenation rates (normalized per Al) with respect to the Ga content. In contrast to C2H6, C3H8 and n-C4H10 dehydrogenation are only catalyzed by [GaH]2+ cations, prevalent at low Ga/Al ratios. (33) As a result, these reaction rates (normalized per Altot) are only proportional to the concentration of [GaH]2+ species in Ga/H-MFI, and [GaH2]+ cations appear to be inactive for C3H8 and n-C4H10 dehydrogenation.
The differences in site requirements discussed above reflect differences between the mechanisms for the dehydrogenation of C2H6, C3H8, and n-C4H10 over Ga/H-MFI. Over [GaH2]+ cations, which catalyze C2H6 dehydrogenation, there are two kinetic regimes: initial C–H cleavage of adsorbed C2H6 (step 2) which appears to limit rates at low C2H6 partial pressures, and desorption of C2H4 from [C2H5–GaH]+ species (via β-hydride elimination) which appears to limit rates at much higher C2H6 partial pressures. The free energy barriers for these phenomena are reflected in first- and zero-order C2H6 dehydrogenation rate coefficients, respectively. Theoretical calculations suggest that the transition state for the first kinetic regime, which is limited by step 2 (initial C–H cleavage) in Scheme 1, is highly constrained, leading to a significant loss of entropy. (29) These entropic losses (29) are predicted to become more severe as the carbon chain length of the alkane increases, likely rendering [GaH2]+ cations inactive for C3H8 and n-C4H10 dehydrogenation, as observed experimentally. On the other hand, the second kinetic regime for C2H6 dehydrogenation, which is limited by step 4 (alkene desorption) in Scheme 1, is predicted (29) to have a much later transition state, resembling a fully formed Ga–H bond and molecular C2H4, and to be much less constrained geometrically than the transition state for step 2.
C3H8 and n-C4H10 dehydrogenation are catalyzed by [GaH]2+ cations. In this case, a single step, involving the concerted formation of alkene and H2 (via β-hydride elimination) from [alkyl–GaH]+–H+ cation pairs, limits the rates of both reactions (see Scheme 2 for C4H10). Initial C–H activation of alkane reactants by [GaH]2+ is enthalpically facile, allowing the Ga center to remain in its electronically favored tetrahedral coordination, and providing the superior Lewis acidic function of [GaH]2+ cations when compared with [GaH2]+ cations. (29)
Table 4 shows measured first- and zero-order rate constants for C2H6 dehydrogenation (normalized per Ga atom) and those for C3H8 dehydrogenation (normalized per [GaH]2+) at 753 K. (33) The first-order rate coefficient for C3H8 dehydrogenation is 453 times higher than the corresponding rate coefficient for C2H6 dehydrogenation, which corresponds to a difference of 9.2 kcal/mol between the Gibbs free energy barriers for the two reactions. The measured apparent activation enthalpy (derived from the first-order rate coefficients) for C2H6 dehydrogenation is only 6.5 kcal/mol higher than that for C3H8 dehydrogenation (19.0 ± 6.0 kcal/mol for C3H8 dehydrogenation (33) and 25.5 ± 4.7 kcal/mol for C2H6 dehydrogenation). (33) Thus, a greater entropic loss for C2H6 dehydrogenation than for C3H8 dehydrogenation is required to explain the observed difference between turnover rates for the two reactants. This conclusion is consistent with the more constrained character of the transition state for C2H6 dehydrogenation via step 2 relative to the β-hydride elimination transition state for C3H8 dehydrogenation. We also note that the ratio of zero-order coefficients for C3H8 and C2H6 dehydrogenation in Table 4 is 97, a value much lower than the ratio of first-order coefficients. This decrease may reflect the fact that in the zero-order regime, both C2H6 and C3H8 dehydrogenation are limited by similar β-hydride elimination transition states.

Comparison of C3H8 and C4H10 dehydrogenation also provides insights. Table 5 lists measured first- and zero-order rate coefficients (both normalized per [GaH]2+) for C3H8 and C4H10 dehydrogenation and the ratio of these constants for C3H8 relative to C4H10. The first-order rate coefficient for C3H8 dehydrogenation is about a factor of 2 higher than that for C4H10 dehydrogenation even though the zero-order rate coefficient for C3H8 dehydrogenation is about a factor of 0.5 lower than that for C4H10 dehydrogenation. In both cases, we estimate that a difference in free energy barriers between the two reactants of about 1 kcal/mol would be sufficient to account for these differences in turnover frequencies. Given the similar mechanism and nature of the rate-determining transition state for dehydrogenation of these two reactants and similar measured activation enthalpies (19.0 ± 6.0 kcal/mol for C3H8 dehydrogenation (33) and 17.5 ± 4.7 kcal/mol for C4H10 dehydrogenation), it is reasonable to expect that free energy barriers for the two reactants would be similar, as also demonstrated by theoretical predictions.

4. Conclusions
The kinetics and mechanisms for C2H6 dehydrogenation and C4H10 dehydrogenation and cracking were examined over Ga/H-MFI catalysts prepared via vapor-phase exchange of dehydrated H-MFI with GaCl3 and subsequently reduced in H2 to remove all Cl. Catalysts prepared via this protocol contain predominantly isolated [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+ cations. We find that C2H6 dehydrogenation is catalyzed by both [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+ cations with similar turnover frequencies over the two species. C2H6 dehydrogenation rates over the Ga/Al = 0.5 sample, which contains [GaH2]+ cations predominantly, follows a Langmuir–Hinshelwood dependence on the C2H6 partial pressure. These kinetics are consistent with a four-step alkyl mechanism catalyzed by [GaH2]+ cations, in which C2H6 physisorbed at [GaH2]+ cations undergoes heterolytic C–H cleavage to form [C2H5–GaH]+ species and H2. The final step involves β-hydride elimination from the alkyl fragment to form C2H4. At low partial pressures of C2H6, dehydrogenation rates are first-order in C2H6 partial pressure and are limited by the initial C–H cleavage step that produces [C2H5–GaH]+ species. However, at high partial pressures of C2H6, [GaH2]+ cations become saturated with [C2H5–GaH]+, resulting in dehydrogenation rates becoming limited by β-hydride elimination.
Reactions of n-C4H8—dehydrogenation, terminal, and central cracking—are catalyzed by [GaH]2+ with turnover frequencies that are 3 orders, 2 orders, and 1 order of magnitude higher, respectively, than the turnover frequencies over H-MFI under identical experimental conditions. [GaH2]+ cations appear to be inactive for these reactions. Space-time studies indicate that trans-2-butene and 1-butene are formed as primary dehydrogenation products. CH4 and C3H6 are the primary products of terminal cracking, and C2H6 and C2H4 are the primary products of central cracking. The rates of all three reactions follow a Langmuir–Hinshelwood dependence on C4H10 partial pressure. These rates are also inhibited by H2. The ratio of the dehydrogenation rate to the cracking (total) rate and the ratio of the rates of the terminal to central cracking are approximately independent of C4H10 partial pressure, suggesting the involvement of a common C4H10-derived surface intermediate for all three reactions. The formation of trans-2-butene and 1-butene as primary dehydrogenation products together with the observed partial pressure dependences of the rates at which these products are formed suggests that these intermediates are [C4H9−GaH]−H+ cation pairs. We note that 1-butene formation is mediated by [n-C4H9−GaH]−H+ cation pairs, whereas trans-2-butene formation is mediated by [sec-C4H9−GaH]−H+ cation pairs. Experimental rate data supported by theoretical calculations are consistent with the prevalence of an alkyl mechanism for C4H10 dehydrogenation and cracking, analogous to previous findings for C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking. (33)
The alkyl mechanism proceeds via facile, heterolytic dissociation of physisorbed n-C4H10 at [GaH]2+ cations to form [n-C4H9–GaH]+–H+ cation pairs. Methyl dehydrogenation proceeds from these species via rate-determining β-hydride elimination while terminal and central cracking proceed via a rate-determining attack of terminal and central C–C bonds in the alkyl fragment by the proximate Brønsted acid O–H group. The rate of terminal cracking over Ga/H-MFI is 3-fold higher than the rate of central cracking.
In summary, this work identifies for the first time the activity of different extra-framework Ga species for the dehydrogenation and cracking of light alkanes over Ga/H-MFI. Our theoretical analysis of the reaction pathways for C2–C4 dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 and C4 alkanes shows how Ga hydride species participate in both reactions and demonstrates that where alkane cracking can occur, dehydration and cracking proceed via a common intermediate.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. (a) Turnover frequencies for C2H6 dehydrogenation (normalized per Altot atom) as a function of the Ga/Al ratio and (b) turnover frequencies for C2H6 dehydrogenation (normalized per Ga atom) as a function of the Ga/Al ratio. Rates were measured at 2 kPa C2H6/He at 753 K and extrapolated to zero space time. Solid lines are guidelines for the eye. Samples were reduced in H2 at 773 K for 1 h prior to the measurement of reaction rates.
