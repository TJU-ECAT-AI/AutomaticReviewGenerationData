An efﬁcient method is developed for the microscopic description of the frequency-dependent polar-
izability of ﬁnite-gap molecules and solids. This is achieved by combining the Tkatchenko-Schefﬂer van
der Waals (vdW) method [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 073005 (2009)] with the self-consistent screening
equation of classical electrodynamics. This leads to a seamless description of polarization and depolar-
ization for the polarizability tensor of molecules and solids. The screened long-range many-body vdW
energy is obtained from the solution of the Schro
¨dinger equation for a system of coupled oscillators. We
show that the screening and the many-body vdW energy play a signiﬁcant role even for rather small
molecules, becoming crucial for an accurate treatment of conformational energies for biomolecules and
binding of molecular crystals. The computational cost of the developed theory is negligible compared to
the underlying electronic structure calculation.

van der Waals (vdW) interactions are ubiquitous in
nature, playing a major role in deﬁning the structure,
stability, and function for a wide variety of molecules
and materials. Thus, the accurate description of vdW in-
teractions is essential for improving our understanding of
many biological, chemical, and (hard and soft) condensed
matter. Many encouraging ideas and methods have been
proposed in recent years for approximately including the
missing long-range vdW interactions in generalized gra-
dient and hybrid density-functional theory (DFT) methods
(see, e.g., Refs. [1–4] and references therein). However, the
efﬁciency of popular methods for vdW interactions hinges
on two major approximations: (1) the neglect or only
effective treatment of electrostatic screening and (2) the
neglect of nonadditive many-body vdW energy contribu-
tions beyond the pairwise approximation.
The recently developed Tkatchenko-Schefﬂer (TS) vdW
method [5] computes the vdW energy for atoms in mole-
cules using the ground-state electron density and accu-
rately includes hybridization effects for the polarizability.
However, the TS-vdW scheme does not include long-range
electrostatic screening extending beyond the range of the
exponentially decaying atomic densities. Neglecting retar-
dation effects, the two-body vdW energy originates from
the electrostatic interaction of ‘‘atomic’’ dipolar ﬂuctua-
tions. When an atom is embedded in a condensed phase (or
in a large molecule), dipolar ﬂuctuations differ from their
free atom counterpart not only because of the local envi-
ronment but also because a ﬂuctuating dipole interacts
electrostatically (via a power law decay) with the more
distant ﬂuctuating dipoles. Both short- and long-range
effects of the environment act to screen the atomic dipolar
ﬂuctuation, and it is important to include these effects in
ﬁrst-principles calculations. In this Letter, we propose to
extend the original TS-vdW method for molecules and
solids by self-consistently including long-range screening
effects in the effective atomic polarizabilities. Even with
this improvement, vdW energies beyond two-body inter-
actions are not included, and this Letter proposes a scheme
based on the coupled ﬂuctuating dipole model (CFDM) [6]
to account for many-body effects. It should be mentioned
that in practical applications the treatment of effects be-
yond two-body has been limited mostly to the three-body
Axilrod-Teller formula [7] (a procedure that might even
give the wrong sign for the many-body vdW energy) [8,9].
The adiabatic-connection ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem
(ACFDT) is an exact expression for the total electron
correlation energy [10]: Thus, it clearly contains the full
many-body vdW energy, and the formulas proposed in this
Letter can be derived with approximations from the
ACFDT formula [11].
We assume that the system (molecule or condensed
matter) has a ﬁnite electronic (highest occupied molecular
orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) gap and can
be divided into effective atomic fragments, for example, by
using the Hirshfeld electron-density partitioning scheme.

short-range
quantum-mechanical exchange-correlation effects are ac-
counted for in p and !p by construction. However, the
TS-vdW deﬁnition of the effective atomic polarizability
lacks the aforementioned long-range electrostatic screen-
ing. In fact, atoms located inside molecules and materials
experience the dynamic electric ﬁeld created by the sur-
rounding atoms, which gives rise to polarization and de-
polarization effects and is largely responsible for the
anisotropy in the molecular polarizability [13,14].
These effects can be included microscopically by mod-
eling the environment as a dipole ﬁeld and solving the
resulting classical electrodynamics self-consistent screen-
ing (SCS) equation [13–15]

where TSðr; i!Þ is the sum of the TS-vdW effective
atomic polarizabilities, and T ðr  r0Þ is the dipole-dipole

The SCS equation requires the dipole polarizability
TSðr; i!Þ as a continuous function over space, while the
TS-vdW method in principle only yields point polarizabil-
ities.

Asanillustration ofincluding the SCS effects, webegin by
considering the static polarizability of the N2 molecule. The
N2 polarizability is anisotropic, with experimental values
being
k ¼ 16:1
and
? ¼ 9:8 bohr3
[iso ¼ ðk þ
2?Þ=3 ¼ 11:9 bohr3] [14]. We ﬁrst extended the TS-
vdW scheme to treat atomic anisotropy by integrating the
Hirshfeld volume in the x, y, and z directions, obtaining
k ¼ 13:7 and ? ¼ 11:9 bohr3 (iso ¼ 12:5 bohr3) for
N2. It is clear that the atomic Hirshfeld partition of the
molecular electron density is not sufﬁcient to reproduce the
anisotropy in the molecular static polarizability. However,
the anisotropy is greatly reduced when calculating the C6
coefﬁcients, because the response becomes increasingly iso-
tropic for larger imaginary frequencies. In fact, this is the
reason why the TS-vdW scheme yields signiﬁcantly better
results for the C6 coefﬁcients (5.5% error) than for the static
polarizability ( 12% error) [5]. The SCS equation with the
TS-vdW polarizability as input yields k ¼ 16:0 and ? ¼
8:7 bohr3 (iso ¼ 11:2 bohr3) for N2, signiﬁcantly increas-
ing the anisotropy. We further calculated the polarizability
tensor of 17 small molecules, ranging from H2 to cyclohex-
ane. The error in the fractional polarizability anisotropy

was
found to be 23% compared to experimental values [14].
However, because the anisotropy is less important for the
integrated vdW coefﬁcients, this error is acceptable, as
shown below by the performance of TS-vdW þ SCS for
intermolecular C6 coefﬁcients. We note that the error in
fractional anisotropy at the TS-vdW level is 80%. Thus, the
screening clearly improves the physical description of the
polarizability anisotropy.
The TS-vdW method has been shown to yield accurate
isotropic C6 coefﬁcients (mean absolute error of 5.5%) for
a large database of 1225 atomic and molecular dimers [5].
The TS-vdW þ SCS method slightly increases the error to
6.3% due to linear alkane chains, where the anisotropy
along the chain is overestimated.
The importance of long-range screening grows with the
system size, becoming the greatest for solids. We illustrate
this effect with the example of hydrogen-saturated silicon
clusters of increasing size and also with the silicon bulk.
The results are shown in Fig. 1 and compared to the time-
dependent local density approximation (TDLDA) calcula-
tions. We measured the accuracy of TDLDA using the
experimentally derived dipole-oscillator strength C6 coef-
ﬁcient for the SiH4 molecule [18] (13% error) and the
CSi-Si
6
coefﬁcient in the silicon bulk (3% error) using the
Clausius-Mossotti equation with the experimental dielec-
tric function [19]. Therefore, we deem the TDLDA C6
coefﬁcients as accurate references for the larger silicon
clusters. For smaller clusters, the TS-vdW values are in
good agreement with TDLDA and experiment. However,
the error in the TS-vdW C6 coefﬁcients increases progres-
sively with the cluster size, with an error of 27% for the
largest cluster, Si172H120. The inclusion of SCS effects

leads to an overall depolarization for the larger clusters,
decreasing the error signiﬁcantly in comparison to
TDLDA. The depolarization is even larger for the Si
bulk, in which the TS-vdW scheme yields an overestima-
tion of 68% in the CSi-Si
6
coefﬁcient in comparison to the
value derived from the experimental dielectric function,
whereas the TS-vdW þ SCS method is in excellent agree-
ment with experiment, with an error of just 8%.
We now extend the TS-vdW þ SCS method to include
the fully nonadditive many-body vdWenergy. For a system
with N atoms, the many-body vdW energy will contain
terms up to Nth order (i.e., 2-body, 3-body, . . ., N-body).
First, the fully screened static polarizability SCS
p
and the
characteristic excitation frequency !SCS
p
are obtained for
every atom in the system using the SCS procedure de-
scribed above [20]. The many-body vdW energy is com-
puted using the coupled ﬂuctuating dipole model (CFDM)
[6,21] for a collection of coupled isotropic three-
dimensional QHOs that represent the atoms in the molecu-
lar system of interest. The CFDM Hamiltonian can be
written as [21]

above equation, the ﬁrst two terms correspond to the
kinetic and potential energy for an individual QHO, while
the third term corresponds to the dipole-dipole interaction
between QHOs [T 0

will be deﬁned below]. The SCS superscript is ommited in
the notation, but assumed for all  and !. The bilinear
form of the interaction term in the CFDM Hamiltonian
allows for a numerically exact solution of the Schro
¨dinger
equation by diagonalizing the 3N  3N interaction matrix.
The vdW interaction energy between the QHOs is then
computed as the difference between the zero-point ener-
gies of the coupled and uncoupled QHOs

where p are the Hamiltonian eigenvalues. The above ex-
pression for the vdW energy can be derived from ACFDT,
since in our case the polarizability is an even function of !
and has only simple poles on or below the real ! axis. Under
these circumstances the ACFDT correlation energy is given
as the difference of zero-point energies [22,23].
The many-body vdW energy is part of the long-range
correlation energy, but in general the correlation energy
includes other contributions. In order to have an electronic
structure method that treats the full range of exchange and
correlation effects, we need to couple the vdWenergy to an
approximate DFT functional. This coupling typically in-
troduces empiricism into the approach. However, instead
of the ad hoc damping functions used in interatomic pair-
wise dispersion-correction approaches, here the coupling is
more naturally introduced through a modiﬁed Coulomb
potential [24]. We take an arbitrary, albeit one of the
simplest, forms for the Coulomb potential
W0ðrpqÞ ¼ f1  exp½ðrpq=RvdW
pq Þg=rpq;
(7)
where  is a range-separation parameter and RvdW
pq
is the
sum of the vdW radii for a pair of atoms p and q. The
parameter  controls how quickly the Coulomb potential
reaches the 1=rpq asymptote in the long range. Physically,
the dispersion energy is ﬁnite in the zero-distance limit
[25]; however, approximate DFT functionals should al-
ready capture part of this energy. Thus we choose   2,
which ensures that W0ðrpqÞ ! 0 when rpq ! 0. In Eq. (7)
the vdW radius of an atom is deﬁned as in the TS-vdW
scheme, RvdW

, where the free
atom vdW radius is obtained from the coupled-cluster
electron density. This accurate reference electron density
is required for a consistent deﬁnition of the vdW radius
with the polarizability [5].
The combination of the TS-vdW scheme with SCS and
CFDM gives rise to an efﬁcient method for obtaining the
vdW energy, wherein short- and long-range screening ef-
fects are seamlessly included and the many-body vdW
energy is computed to inﬁnite order in the dipole approxi-
mation. In what follows we call this new scheme DFA þ
MBD, where DFA is substituted by the name of the func-
tional used to approximate the DFT energy, and MBD
means many-body dispersion. We benchmarked the per-
formance of DFA þ MBD on the S22 database of inter-
molecular interactions [26,27]. All DFA calculations
employ the FHI-AIMS code [28]. The  parameter in

Eq. (7) is determined using the S22 database ( ¼ 2:56 for
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [29],  ¼ 2:53 for PBE0
[30]). The mean absolute relative error (MARE) with
respect to the recent coupled-cluster method with singles,
doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] binding ener-
gies computed at the basis-set limit is shown in Fig. 2 for
different state-of-the-art methods. The range of binding
energies in the S22 database varies from 23 to 895 meV,
thus the MARE is the most unambiguous measure of the
performance. The MARE is decreased from 9.2% for
PBE þ TS-vdW to 5.4% for PBE þ MBD. In particular,
the MARE for vdW-bound systems is reduced by 10%
compared to PBE þ TS-vdW. We note that both PBE þ
MBD and PBE0 þ MBD methods yield remarkable accu-
racy for all types of intermolecular interactions in the S22
database.
In order to show that the improvement obtained with
DFA þ MBD also holds outside of the S22 database, we
calculated the relative energies of 27 conformers of alanine
tetrapeptide (Ace-Ala3-NMe)—a fundamental biomolecu-
lar benchmark system [31,32]. As a reference, we use
recently calculated CCSD(T) relative energies [31,32].
The PBE0 þ TS-vdW method yields a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 0:52 kcal=mol compared to CCSD(T). However,
PBE0 þ TS-vdW predicts the wrong conformation to be
the most stable, and there are changes in the conforma-
tional hierarchy compared to CCSD(T). PBE0 þ MBD
reduces the MAE to just 0:29 kcal=mol, predicting the
right conformation to be the most stable one and leading
to a conformational hierarchy in excellent agreement with
CCSD(T). The differences in conformational energies be-
tween
PBE0 þ TS-vdW
and
PBE0 þ MBD
reach
1 kcal=mol, illustrating the importance of including SCS
and the MBD energy contributions for reaching chemical
accuracy in biomolecular simulations.
The screening effects and the many-body vdW energy
become even more pronounced for extended systems. Here
we use the benzene molecular crystal as an example, since
the crystal geometry and the cohesive energy have been
accurately measured [33,34], as well as recently computed
using the exact-exchange plus RPA correlation energy
method [35]. We computed the cohesive energy using the
PBE þ TS-vdW and PBE þ MBD methods at the experi-
mental geometry. At the PBE þ TS-vdW level, the cohe-
sive energy was computed as 690 meV=molecule, which is
a signiﬁcant overestimation compared to the experimental
values of 518–560 meV=molecule (extrapolated to 0 K and
with zero-point vibrational energy subtracted) [35]. PBE þ
MBD signiﬁcantly improves the prediction, yielding
565 meV=molecule. Notice the large reduction of the
binding energy that comes from the collective inclusion
of both SCS and MB effects.
In conclusion, we have developed an efﬁcient method
for obtaining an accurate description of vdW interactions
that includes both screening effects and treatment of the
many-body vdWenergy to inﬁnite order. This method has a
single physically motivated range-separation parameter for
a given DFT functional and is applicable to ﬁnite-gap
molecules and condensed matter systems. The calculation
of the MBD energy takes  3 min for a system of 1000
atoms on a single processor (DFT calculation time not
included). Our method signiﬁcantly improves the binding
energies for small molecules compared to high-level quan-
tum chemical methods, with pronounced improvements
found for larger, more complex systems. The efﬁciency
of our method paves the way to molecular dynamics simu-
lations with the full many-body treatment of vdW inter-
actions. Work to derive the self-consistent MBD potential
and forces is in progress.

[12] The employed expression for the frequency-dependent
polarizability [Eq. (1)] does not satisfy the Thomas-
Reiche-Kuhn sum rule, since the TS-vdW model only
accounts for dipole ﬂuctuations of the valence electrons.
The calculation of the vdW energy requires evaluating
integrals over products of atomic frequency-dependent
polarizabilities, which are shown to be accurate in our
work. We note that the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule
might become important for computing the vdW interac-
