First principles calculations using density functional theory with
corrections for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT + U) are pre-
sented in which we compute the energy for the conversion of CO
to CO2, NO2 to NO and NO to N2 over ceria surfaces. The sur-
face sensitivity is discussed on the basis of the vacancy formation
energies.
Introduction
Ceria, CeO2, is used as a support material in automotive
catalysis.1 However, due to the relative ease with which ceria
surfaces can be reduced (formation of oxygen vacancies) it is not
merely an inactive support. In particular, the reduction of ceria
surfaces provides oxygen atoms so that carbon monoxide can be
oxidised to CO2. A reduced ceria surface can be re-oxidised by
extracting oxygen from NO2, which dissociates to NO as
demonstrated with atomic force microscopy in ref. 2. The NO
so formed can dissociate on a reduced ceria surface with the
release of N2. Fig. 1 displays a schematic of the catalytic cycle
for the conversion of NO2 and CO over a ceria surface.
Knowledge of the mechanism of these reactions, their ener-
getics and any surface sensitivity would be of great help in
developing and optimising new ceria-containing catalysts. Be-
fore this is possible, an understanding of the properties of ceria
surfaces must be obtained. In ref. 3–6 the low index (111), (110)
and (100) surfaces have been studied using ﬁrst principles
density functional theory with the generalised gradient approx-
imation (GGA-DFT). The results are consistent with previous
atomistic simulations and experimental data.
The study of reduced ceria surfaces is more problematic.
Skorodumova et al.3 claimed that treating the unoccupied
cerium 4f states as valence (Ce4+) gives a good description of
bulk ceria and the low index surfaces. However in order to
describe correctly the Ce3+ ions of fully reduced ceria, Ce2O3,
the 4f states needed to be treated as core (localised), even
though they are occupied in reduced ceria. This approach
introduces an unnecessary user deﬁned input to the description
of the electronic structure of ceria.
We have demonstrated that for partially reduced ceria sur-
faces, GGA-DFT incorrectly delocalises the partially occupied
Ce 4f states.5,6 A correction for DFT, such as the DFT + U
approach for on-site Coulomb interactions,7 localises these
states, so that artiﬁcially describing occupied Ce 4f states as
core is unnecessary. With DFT + U (U = 5 eV5,6), we have
obtained a description of reduced ceria surfaces consistent with
experimental ﬁndings.9,10 Similar results have been obtained for
bulk ceria by Fabris et al.11
In order to understand further the role of ceria in catalytic
reactions, we have studied for the ﬁrst time the sensitivity of the
energetics of CO oxidation and NO2 and NO reduction over
ceria to the nature of the surface. Throughout, we apply the DFT
+ U approach, which we have shown to model in a consistent
fashion the electronic structure of pure and reduced ceria.5,6
Methods
We compute the total energy of all species with the DFT code
VASP,12 in which valence electronic states are expanded in a set
of periodic plane waves and the interaction between the core
and the valence states is treated with the projector augmented
wave (PAW) method;13 the Ce core is [Xe] and the C, N and O
cores are [He]. We use the PW91 GGA exchange–correlation
functional,14 a 500 eV plane wave cut-oﬀenergy and all
calculations involving Ce were performed at the DFT + U
level with a U value of 5 eV.5,7 The surfaces are modelled with a
three-dimensional slab model of ﬁnite thickness ((111) surface:
10.5 A
˚ (12 atomic layers), (110) surface: 11.5 A
˚ (7 atomic layers)
and (100) surface: 10.94 A
˚ (9 layers)) in which adjacent slabs are
separated by a suﬃciently large vacuum gap to eliminate slab–
slab interactions perpendicular to the surface. Oxygen vacancies
are formed on both sides of the slab to ensure that no dipoles
are formed. p(2  2) expansions of the (111) and (100) surface
unit cells are applied to minimise defect–defect interactions
resulting from the periodic nature of the surface models, while
for the (110) surface, a p(2  1) expansion is applied. All
calculations involving oxygen vacancies are fully spin polarised.
k-space was sampled using a 2  2  1 Monkhorst–Pack grid

Results
Table 1 presents the surface energies and the energies for partial
reduction of the three surfaces as well as the computed energies
for conversion of CO, NO2 and NO to CO2, NO and N2. The
vacancy formation energies reported will be aﬀected by known
errors in the binding energy of O2 calculated using DFT.15,16
This overstabilises O2 and the present vacancy formation
energies are thus an underestimation. Comparison with the
experimental O2 binding energy17 indicates that this error will
result in an increase in the vacancy formation energy of the
order of 0.70 eV. This error is surface independent and hence
does not aﬀect the surface dependence of the vacancy formation
energies and our analysis. Vacancy formation energies will also
be inﬂuenced by the value of U; however, testing of U values
from 1–7 eV,5 shows that too small a value of U leads to the
wrong description of the atomic and electronic structure of
reduced ceria and the vacancy formation and reaction energies
so computed will be inﬂuenced by this error. Thus, the energies
presented in what follows are derived from calculations using a
value of U (5 eV) which provides a description of defective
ceria5,6 that is consistent with experiment.9,10 The magnitude of
the vacancy formation energies in Table 1 is such that at the
high temperatures present in an automotive exhaust, formation
of oxygen vacancies will be relatively favourable, compared to
other oxides, such as MgO. This is consistent with the known
catalytic behaviour of ceria.
The surface energies conﬁrm that the order of stability of the
pure surfaces is (111) 4 (110) 4 (100), see ref. 5 for more
details. However, the vacancy formation energies display a
diﬀerent dependence on the surface, which has not been
observed before. For the low energy compact (111) surface we
ﬁnd that formation of an oxygen vacancy is least favourable,
which is not unexpected, while this process is most favoured on
the (110) surface. In terms of catalytic activity the least stable
surface is usually considered to be most applicable as a cataly-
tically active material; in the present case, this would be the
(100) surface. However, the present results show that it is not
necessarily possible to predict from the stability of the pure
surfaces the surface for which oxygen vacancy formation will be
most favourable and hence the surface that should be most
catalytically active. To understand the origin of this result, we
have carried out an electronic relaxation of the surfaces upon
formation of the oxygen vacancy; in these calculations, the
atomic positions are not relaxed. The vacancy formation
energies from the electronic relaxation show that the ordering
of the vacancy formation energies follows the stability of the
pure surface. Compared to the fully relaxed defective surfaces,
this indicates that the stability of the vacancy is driven by
atomic relaxations.
The catalytic reactions in Table 1 are all exothermic (the
exothermic nature of the reactions is independent of the surface,
as is the energy of the reaction CO + NO2 - CO2 + NO or
CO + NO - CO2 + 1/2 N2) so that reduction of NO2 and NO
to NO and 1/2 N2 and oxidation of CO to CO2 is favoured. Of
interest is the surface sensitivity of the reaction. This question
has been explored to an extent with the oxidation of CO to CO2
on polycrystalline ceria18 (which shows (111) faces) and ceria
nanorods19 (which show (110) and (100) faces). The conclusion
from these studies is that the reactivity towards CO oxidation
depends on the nature of the exposed surface, so that nanorods
were found to be more active than nanoparticles (which expose
predominantly the (111) face).19
The energy gained in the formation of CO2 from CO for the
(110) surface is qualitatively consistent with the results of ref. 20
and 21, in which the energy gain for this reaction was computed
to be 3.40 eV, using an interatomic potential (IP) approach;
this is the only reaction for which we have existing literature
data available for comparison. On the (111) surface, both the
present DFT + U result and the IP result show that the
reaction is less exothermic, with a reaction energy of 0.22
eV with the IP, compared to a reaction energy of 0.56 eV for
the DFT + U calculations. Both the present results and the IP
results suggest a surface sensitivity that is consistent with
experimental conclusions.18,19 While the IP and DFT + U
data are consistent, the reaction energies computed with IPs will
be dependent on the exact IP applied and require the use of an
experimental estimate of the second electron aﬃnity of oxygen,
which is known to be sensitive to the oxygen environment.22 We
have demonstrated that the energetics and structural relaxa-
tions of the pure (111), (110) and (100) surfaces are dependent
on the IP used8 and it would be reasonable to assume that the
same applies to the defective surfaces. The present results
advocate the application of DFT + U to the study of cataly-
tically interesting reactions; for the abstraction of hydrogen
from methane over Li-doped MgO, the utility of DFT + U in
describing the energetics has been shown.23
The energy for the reaction CO + NO2 - CO2 + NO (as
well as CO + NO - CO2 + 1/2 N2) is independent of the ceria
surface, since ceria is simply a catalyst for the reaction. We can
comment on the surface dependence of the individual reactions
and develop an understanding regarding the magnitudes of the
energies as well as the surface dependency. For example, the
energy for formation of CO2 is most favourable on the (110)
surface and least favourable on the (111) surface. The origin of
this diﬀerence arises from the vacancy formation energies which
show that formation of an oxygen vacancy is least favoured on
the (111) surface. Conversely, the formation of NO from NO2 is
now most favourable on a reduced (111) surface. Since the
formation of NO from NO2 re-oxidises a reduced surface, it

should be clear that this will be favoured for the (111) surface,
for which formation of a reduced surface is least favoured in the
ﬁrst place. The same analysis holds for reduction of NO over a
reduced ceria surface. Thus, it is the oxygen vacancy formation
energy (which we have shown is not related to the stability of the
pure surface6) which determines the surface sensitivity of these
catalytic reactions. Taking this into account, the (110) surface
seems to be a suitable surface on which to study these catalytic
reactions.
The magnitude of the energy gained in each reaction can be
related to the interactions between the molecules and the oxide
surfaces. Preliminary calculations indicate that strong changes
to the surface structure are found for CO oxidation,8 while for
NO reduction the reaction will certainly involve more than one
molecule, with a complex mechanism for formation of N2. For
NO2 reduction, the mechanism is very simple; NO2 simply loses
one oxygen atom to heal a vacancy site, yielding NO. This is
quite a facile process at 300–400 K.24 Future work will consider
the details of the reaction mechanisms.
Conclusion
We have presented the ﬁrst calculation of the energetics for the
catalytic conversion of CO, NO2 and NO to CO2, NO and N2
over pure and defective ceria surfaces, using a consistent ﬁrst
principles approach that describes pure and reduced ceria. The
present results show that the most favourable surface for
vacancy formation cannot simply be predicted from the stabi-
lity of the pure surfaces. In addition, we have demonstrated that
the sensitivity of the energetics of the catalytic reactions to the
nature of the surfaces is determined by the surface vacancy
formation energy. The surface sensitivity so found is consistent
with experimental data for CO oxidation over ceria nanopar-
ticles and nanorods. These results represent an important
contribution to developing our understanding of the role of
ceria in promoting catalytic reactions.
