Dissociative adsorption is one of the most important reactions in catalysis. In this communication
we propose a model aiming to generalize the important factors that affect dissociation reactions.
Speciﬁcally, for a dissociation reaction, say AB→A1B, the model connects the dissociation barrier
with the association barrier, the chemisorption energies of A and B at the ﬁnal state and the bonding
energy of AB in the gas phase. To apply this model, we have calculated CO dissociation on
Ru~0001!, Rh~111!, Pd~111! ~4d transition metals!, Os~0001!, Ir~111!, and Pt~111! ~5d transition
metals! using density function theory ~DFT!. All the barriers are determined. We ﬁnd that the DFT
results can be rationalized within the model. The model can also be used to explain many
experimental observations.

Undoubtedly, the dissociation of molecules is one of the
most important reactions in catalysis. It is the ﬁrst step and
often the rate-determining step in many catalytic processes.
Therefore, dissociation reactions have been extensively stud-
ied both experimentally and theoretically in the last 50
years.1–7 Following the detailed investigation of the simplest
system, H2 dissociation on metal surfaces,2,3 the dissociation
of heavier molecules, such as NO, CO, and N2, on ﬂat and
stepped metal surfaces4–6 have recently received more atten-
tion and some progress in understanding these reactions has
been made. To date two factors4 are found to affect the dis-
sociation reactions. The ﬁrst one is the electronic factor: It
has been found experimentally that the reactivity of transi-
tion metals for dissociation reactions decreases from left to
right in the periodic table.7 Hammer and Norskov4 have suc-
cessfully correlated the reactivity of metal for dissociation
reactions with the metal d band center. The second factor is
the geometrical one: Both experimental and theoretical work
shows that dissociation reactions occur much more efﬁ-
ciently on corrugated surfaces than on ﬂat surfaces.4,6 De-
spite these advances, a general model for dissociation reac-
tions is still unavailable. In this communication we intend to
generalize all the important factors that affect dissociation
reactions in one model.
For any co-adsorption system of two adsorbates, say A
and B, the total chemisorption energy of A and B, EA1B ,
can be written8 @Fig. 1~a!#
EA1B5EA1EB2Eint,
~1!
where EA(EB) is the chemisorption energy of A ~B! in the
co-adsorption structure ~including both transition state like
and ﬁnal state like structures! without B ~A!, and Eint is
deﬁned as the interaction energy. The physical meanings of
EA1B , EA , and EB are self-evident, and Eint is a quantitative
measure of the interaction between A and B in the coadsorp-
tion system, which is believed mainly due to a bonding com-
petition effect9,10 that results from the sharing atom of two
adsorbates on the surface.4,6,11–13 If A and B do not share
atoms in a coadsorption system, Eint will be very small.10,11
Speciﬁcally,
suppose
that
a
dissociation
reaction,
AB→A1B, occurs on a catalyst. We can obtain the follow-
ing equation for the transition state ~TS! and the ﬁnal state
~FS! using Eq. ~1!:

systematically investigated CO dissociation on Ru~0001!,

using density function theory. Calculation details are de-
scribed in Refs. 14–18. Transition states of all reactions were
searched by constraining the C–O distance, using the so-
called constrained minimization technique.9,15,16 The TS is
identiﬁed when ~i! the force on the atoms vanishes and ~ii!
the energy is a maximum along the reaction coordinate, but a
minimum with respect to all remaining degrees of freedom.

The lowest energy TSs for CO dissociation on different tran-
sition metal surfaces have been shown in Fig. 2 and their
structural parameters are listed in Table I. Although all the
metal surfaces investigated are close packed, it can be seen
that the TS structures can be quite different, especially in CO
dissociation on Os~0001!. Nevertheless, there are obvious
common features at the TSs: ~1! long stretched distance be-
tween the C and the O at the TSs ~Table I!, which are usually
called ‘‘late TSs,’’ and ~2! sharing of bonding with a metal
atom between the C and the O ~Fig. 2!, implying the exis-
tence of bonding competition effect. Our TS geometry on
Pt~111! is qualitatively consistent with the estimation from
previous work.5 All the reaction barriers and each term in
Eq. ~5! have been determined and are shown in Table II.
It can be seen that Ea
dis vary considerably from 0.55 to
2.21 eV on these metals ~Table II!, but there is a correlation
between Ea
dis and SEX
FS in each row of the periodic table
investigated. This appears to be evident by the linear regres-
sion ﬁtting Ea
dis against SEX
FS ~for 4d and 5d metals!, shown
in Fig. 3. For 4d metals, we obtain Ea
dis520.98SEX
FS
112.98 while for 5d it is Ea
dis521.35SEX
FS117.30. A simi-
lar phenomenon has been observed by Hammer for NO
dissociation.4 Hammer suggested that the apparent long dis-
tance between N and O atoms at the TS is the reason for the
linear relationship ~TSs behave like FSs!. In fact, these re-
sults can be qualitatively explained using Eq. ~5!. Appar-
ently, the slope for 4d metals ~20.98! agrees well with the
theoretical prediction ~21! of Eq. ~5! assuming that Ea
as is
constant. On the other hand, the slope of 21.35 for 5d met-
als is substantially lower than 21, indicating that Ea
as varies
in an opposite trend with SEX
FS. As can be seen in Table II,
on going from left to right in 5d metals of the periodic table,
Ea
as increases just in contrast to SEX
FS . It is this variation of
Ea
as that lowers the slope of a 5d metal curve to 21.35. In

fact, even for 4d metals Ea
as is not constant either. The Ea
as on
Rh is about 0.2 eV lower than that on Ru and Pd, resulting in
the point of Rh being slightly away from the linear line
(Ea
dis520.98SEX
FS112.98) for 4d metals. Nevertheless, the
changes in Ea
as are much less pronounced than that in SEX
FS ,
leading to the apparent linear relationship between the disso-
ciation barrier and the FS chemisorption energy.19 In other
words, to a large extent the dissociation reaction barrier is
determined by the FS atomic chemisorption energy for these
systems. This is consistent with the empirical Bronsted–
Polanyi relationship, which indicates the change in reaction
barrier can be correlated with the change in the heat of reac-
tion as long as the reaction mechanism is unchanged.20 It
should be stressed that the Bronsted–Polanyi relationship is
only qualitatively correct because Ea
dis not only depends on
SEX
FS , but also is related to the Ea
as @Eq. ~5!#. As shown in
Table II for CO dissociation on all the close-packed metal
surfaces investigated, even with the same reaction mecha-
nism Ea
as is not constant and hence the relationship between
Ea
dis and SEX
FS is not exactly linear.
Since the dissociation barrier also depends on the asso-
ciation barrier @Eq. ~5!#, it is worth discussing the origin of
the association barrier. Using Eqs. ~2! and ~3!, we can write
Ea
as as
Ea
as5EA1B
FS

TS 5DEA1DEB1DEint,
~6!
where DEA5EA
FS2EA
TS ; DEB5EB
FS2EB
TS, and DEint5Eint
TS
2Eint
FS'Eint
TS . Obviously, all three terms strongly depend on
the TS geometry. DEA(DEB) is further related to the chemi-
sorption energy of A ~B! at the FS.21 As EA
FS and EB
FS in-
crease, DEA and DEB should increase. Eint
TS measures the
bonding competition effect at the TS geometry, which is
metal dependent. To screen off the TS geometry effect on
Eint
TS, and then to estimate the quantitative trend of bonding
competition effect on different metals, we performed the fol-
lowing calculations: ~i! optimizing the C and the O in a
separate p(232) unit cell ~both at hcp hollow sites!, respec-
tively, and calculating their chemisorption energies, namely
EC and EO ; and ~ii! calculating the total chemisorption en-
ergy, EC1O, of a C and O coadsorption, in which the C is at
a hcp hollow site and the O at the neighboring hcp site22
~thus they share bonding with metal atoms! and both are
ﬁxed in structure ~i!. Then we deﬁne Eint
0 5EC1EO2EC1O
as the standard interaction energy. All Eint
0
are listed in
Table II. It can be seen that as the metal d occupancy in-
creases ~from left to right in the periodic table!, Eint
0 is in-
creased. In contrast, SEX
FS is reduced with the increase of d
occupancy4 ~Table II!. Therefore, it is these two opposite
trends that result in the overall small change in Ea
as @Eq. ~6!#
compared with that in Ea
dis. For example, for 5d metals the
change in Ea
as is 0.38 eV ~larger than 4d metals!, while the
change in Ea
dis is higher up to 1.41 eV ~Table II!. It should be
noted that the above discussion of bonding competition ef-
fect and SEX
FS is based on the fact that the reactions studied
here possess late TSs. In this case, it is the bonding compe-
tition effect, not the bonding and antibonding states between
the C and the O, that greatly inﬂuences the Eint
TS .
Based on the understanding presented here, we can ex-
plain many observations for dissociation reactions. For ex-
ample, the two important factors that affect the dissociation
barrier, namely the electronic and geometrical factors,23 can
be rationalized within the present model. The electronic ef-
fect on the dissociation barrier, i.e., the increase of the dis-
sociation barrier from left to right in the periodic table,
mainly results from the variation of SEX
FS , as shown in Fig.
2. This chemisorpion energy trend also affects Ea
as and ﬁnally
affects Ea
dis, but to a much less extent for systems with late
TSs. The geometrical effect on the dissociation barriers, i.e.,
lower dissociation barriers on steps,6 kinks, and defects than
that on terraces,4 is mainly a consequence of change in Ea
as ,
particularly in Eint
TS . On these corrugated surfaces, the reac-
tion can achieve such TS structures that two reactants do not
share bonding with metal atoms ~the dissociation path has
been changed at the corrugated surfaces!. As a result, the
bonding competition between the two reactants is small at
the TSs, resulting in a small DEint(Eint
TS). Thus, the associa-
tion barriers, Ea
as , will be small @Eq. ~6!#, leading to ﬁnally
lower dissociation barriers.
It is worth mentioning the effect of AB bonding energy
in the gas phase, EAB , on the dissociation barrier. It can be
seen in Eq. ~5! that the higher the EAB is, the larger the
dissociation barrier, which is obvious from chemical intu-
ition. What is not apparent is whether a dissociation reaction
should be a nonactivated one ~no dissociation barrier! or an
activated one and whether a dissociation reaction should oc-
cur through the precursor-mediated mechanism ~molecules
adsorb molecularly ﬁrst and then dissociate!. The present
model can provide some clues to the answers to these ques-
tions. In Eq. ~5!, if Ea
as1EAB.SEx
FS , the reaction is cer-
tainly an activated process; if Ea
as1EAB,SEx
FS , then the
reaction would occur without a barrier ~nonactivated!, other-
wise the reaction should follow a precursor-mediated mecha-
nism @Fig. 1~b!#.
In summary, this work represents one of the ﬁrst at-
tempts to generalize a model for dissociation barriers. Spe-
ciﬁcally, a model to connect the dissociation barrier to the
association barrier, chemisorption energies at the FS, and the
bonding energy of the molecule is proposed. Using the
present model many observations can be rationalized.

13Eint may contain other terms, such as the Pauli repulsion. The Pauli repul-
sion contribution to Eint is important only when A and B are very close
~Ref. 11!. For the systems concerned in this communication, the distances
between A and B are usually large. In addition, the distances between A
and B at the TSs determined in this study are similar. Therefore, one may
expect that the Pauli repulsion contribution to Eint will not change dra-
matically from one system to another. In other words, the Pauli repulsion
will not considerably affect the reactivity difference for the systems in-
vestigated in this study.
14A generalized gradient approximation was utilized in all the calculations
~Ref. 17!. The electronic wave functions were expanded in a plane wave
basis set and the ionic cores were described by ultrasoft pseudopotentials
~Ref. 18!. Ru~0001!, Rh~111!, Pd~111!, Os~0001!, Ir~111!, and Pt~111!
were modeled by three layers slabs with all layers ﬁxed at their bulk
positions. The surface relaxation was checked and found to be rather small
~less than 0.1 eV!. The vacuum region between slabs was 10 Å and a
cutoff energy of 340 eV was used. 33331k point sampling for p(2
32) unit cell and 33231k point sampling for p(233) unit cell have
been used in calculations. Convergence check has been performed by
increasing k point sampling up to 43431 for p(232) slab and 333
31 for p(233) slab. Previous work ~Refs. 15 and 16! also show that this
setup affords enough accuracy. All the total energy calculations were per-
formed using CASTEP @M. C. Payne, M. P. Teter, D. C. Allan, T. A.

19The effect of the approximate linear relationship between Ea
dis and SEX
FS
with a slope around 21 is quite dramatic in some sense. For instance, if
SEX
FS lowers down by 0.5 eV, then the barrier will increase by 0.5 eV
@such chemisorption energy difference can be easily achieved if sulphur
sits at the neighboring site of reaction center ~Refs. 11 and 12!#. Thus a
little sulphur addition should suppress the local reactivity of metal surface.
The same explanation is also applicable for the self-poisoning phenom-
enon ~coverage effect!, in which as the coverage of the fragments in-
creases, the dissociation reaction rate decreases quickly due to the consid-
erable decrease in SEX
FS .
20See, e.g., R. A. van Santen and M. Neurock, Catal. Rev. Sci. Eng. 37, 557
~1995!.
21EA
TS can be approximated as EA
TS5E0f(r02rTS), where E0 is the chemi-
sorption energy of A at the optimized position, r0 , and rTS is the TS

mainly on how two adsorbates sharing bonding with the top layer metal
atoms. Metal atoms in the second layer have little effect on Eint
0 . For
example, Eint

for C on a hcp site and O on a neighboring hcp site on
Pt~111! is calculated as 1.10 eV ~Table II!, which is very similar to that for
C on a hcp site and O on a neighboring fcc site ~1.19 eV!.
