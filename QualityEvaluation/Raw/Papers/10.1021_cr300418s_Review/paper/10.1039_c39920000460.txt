In the presence of rhodium, the H2-Ce02 interaction is to a large extent reversible, simple evacuation of the 
reduced sample has been demonstrated to promote reoxidation of the support; this explains some puzzling 
effects of the reduction/evacuation treatments on the actual oxidation state of ceria in Rh-CeOz catalysts. 
In the last few years, many research groups have concentrated 
their efforts in the study of the redox surface chemistry of 
ceria, an essential piece of knowledge in understanding some 
of its most interesting catalytic properties, i.e. its oxygen 
storage capacity, 
1 its singular chemisorptive properties against 
H2,*-5 or the precise nature of the strong metal-support 
interaction phenomena suggested to occur over a number o
f
 
mctal-Ce02 systems.6.1" Many important questions remain 
unanswered as yet. In particular, the role played by highly 
dispersed metals has not been extensively investigated. 
The catalyst, with 2.9% metal loading by m a s ,  was 
prepared by incipient wetness impregnation from an aqueous 
solution of Rh(N03)3. After the impregnation step, it was 
dried in air, at 383 K, for 10 h, and then stored until it was 
reduced in situ with hydrogen, at 623 K, for 1 h. The cerium 
dioxide was a high surface area (135 m* g-1) sample. The

Fig. 1 XPS spectra of the Ce 3d transitions in (a) bare CeOl and (b) Rh-Ce02 system submitted to the following conditions: (i) 
evacuation at- 
295 K; (ii) heating under H2 (PH2 
= 760 Torr) 
temp. 623 K; (iv) similar conditions to (ii) and (iii), temp. 773 K 
Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was not signifi- 
cantly modified by either the impregnation or the reduction 
treatments. High resolution electron microscopy images 
showed that the rhodium dispersion was very high, with metal 
crystallites not larger than 1.5 nm.

which was used and the way of estimating the percentage of 
CeIV reduced after each of the treatments are given else-

A precursor/support sample, the mass of which was 128.5 
mg, was submitted to the successive series of treatments 
indicated in Table 1. In accordance with this Table, the initial 
hydrogen treatment at 623 K leads to the reduction of ceria to 
an extent, 26.1%, quite close to that reported3 for the 
reduction of a bare high surface area (115 m2 g-1) oxide 
sample. The effect of the evacuation treatment ( P  <1O-S 
Torr; 1 Torr = 133.322 Pa) at the reduction temperature, 
however, is completely different for Ce02 
and Rh-Ce02. In 
the first case, for ceria only, the reduction level remains 
unaltered, whereas, over Rh-Ce02, support reoxidation 
occurs to a large extent. 
The results reported in Table 1 demonstrate that at room 
temperature, the catalyst takes up large amounts of hydrogen, 
apparent H/Rh: 5.7, in good agreement with the results 
obtained from volumetric measurements. For ceria only no 
significant hydrogen adsorption takes place below 473 K.3.4 
The spill over observed at 295 K on our Rh-Ce02 catalyst 
implies the reduction of ceria to a similar extent to that 
reached after the treatment with hydrogen at 623 K. Data 
included in Table 1 also show that we can arrive at a cyclic 
reproducible behaviour for the H2-(Rh-Ce02) system, thus 
indicating that, in the presence of highly dispersed rhodium, 
hydrogen chemisorption on ceria is to a large extent revers- 
ible. Fwthermore, upon raising the evacuation temperature 
and further evacuation at 473 K; (iii) similar conditions to (ii), 
up to 773 K, some further reoxidation of ceria occurs, the final 
reduction level reached by the support being similar to that of 
the starting, untreated with hydrogen, sample. 
The results presented here suggest that the actual state of 
ceria submitted to a reduction treatment with hydrogen 
depends critically on the presence of the metal. For ceria only, 
irreversible reduction of the oxide, leading to the elimination 
of H 2 0 ,  and therefore to the creation of oxygen vacancies, 
takes place to a much larger extent. This can be important 
when discussing the likely occurrence and actual nature of 
metal-support interaction in metal-C'e02 catalysts. It can also 
be deduced from our results that the evacuation conditions, 
rather than the reduction treatment can constitute the key 
factor in determining the reduction level reached by ceria in 
rhodium containing phases. 
Fig. 1 shows Ce(3d) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(XPS) spectra corresponding to our Ce02 and Rh-Ce02 
samples, untreated as well as reduced with H
2
 at 473, 623 and 
773 K. Upon analysing these two series of spectra, more 
specifically the variation throughout them of the relative 
intensity of the so-called v' peak, considered to be as a 
characteristic feature of Ce"1 ions,l2 some conclusions can be 
drawn. In contrast with that found for ceria only, for which the 
reduction degree increases as the reduction temperature 
does;3 for Rh-Ce02 the highest reduction level is reached at 
473 K, becoming lower at higher reduction temperatures. 
Rh(3d) XPS spectra, on the other hand, show that the three 
reduction treatments lead to Rho. This, in principle, puzzling 
result can reasonably be interpreted 
as owing to reoxidation of 
ceria occurring during the evacuation following the hydrogen 
treatment of Rh-Ce02 samples. Also worth of noting is that 
after reduction at 473 K, the rhodium containing sample 
becomes more deeply reduced than the bare support. The 
opposite is true for higher reduction temperatures. This is very

consistent with our observations”.“ in the sense that the 
hydrogen interaction with pure cerium dioxide just starts to be 
observed at 473 K. 
Our results can also be very helpful to interpret the 
temperature programmed desorption-H2 diagrams as well as 
the conventional hydrogen volumetric chemisorption studies 
carried out on Rh-Ce02 catalysts. In particular would be 
stressed the occurrence of hydrogen desorption from the 
support below 473 K, even at 295 K. Obviously, this obliged us 
to be cautious in assigning the hydrogen forms desorbed in the 
low temperature region, i.e. 295-473 K, to species chemi- 
sorbed on the metal, or even to the so-called revcrsible forms.
