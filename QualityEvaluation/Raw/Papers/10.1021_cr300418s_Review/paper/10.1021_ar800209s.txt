Abstract
Because of growing environmental concerns and increasingly stringent regulations governing auto emissions, new more efficient exhaust catalysts are needed to reduce the amount of pollutants released from internal combustion engines. To accomplish this goal, the major pollutants in exhaust—CO, NOx, and unburned hydrocarbons—need to be fully converted to CO2, N2, and H2O. Most exhaust catalysts contain nanocrystalline noble metals (Pt, Pd, Rh) dispersed on oxide supports such as Al2O3 or SiO2 promoted by CeO2. However, in conventional catalysts, only the surface atoms of the noble metal particles serve as adsorption sites, and even in 4−6 nm metal particles, only 1/4 to 1/5 of the total noble metal atoms are utilized for catalytic conversion. The complete dispersion of noble metals can be achieved only as ions within an oxide support.
In this Account, we describe a novel solution to this dispersion problem: a new solution combustion method for synthesizing dispersed noble metal ionic catalysts. We have synthesized nanocrystalline, single-phase Ce1−xMxO2−δ and Ce1−x−yTiyMxO2−δ (M = Pt, Pd, Rh; x = 0.01−0.02, δ ≈ x, y = 0.15−0.25) oxides in fluorite structure. In these oxide catalysts, Pt2+, Pd2+, or Rh3+ ions are substituted only to the extent of 1−2% of Ce4+ ion. Lower-valent noble metal ion substitution in CeO2 creates oxygen vacancies. Reducing molecules (CO, H2, NH3) are adsorbed onto electron-deficient noble metal ions, while oxidizing (O2, NO) molecules are absorbed onto electron-rich oxide ion vacancy sites. The rates of CO and hydrocarbon oxidation and NOx reduction (with >80% N2 selectivity) are 15−30 times higher in the presence of these ionic catalysts than when the same amount of noble metal loaded on an oxide support is used. Catalysts with palladium ion dispersed in CeO2 or Ce1−xTixO2 were far superior to Pt or Rh ionic catalysts. Therefore, we have demonstrated that the more expensive Pt and Rh metals are not necessary in exhaust catalysts.
We have also grown these nanocrystalline ionic catalysts on ceramic cordierite and have reproduced the results we observed in powder material on the honeycomb catalytic converter. Oxygen in a CeO2 lattice is activated by the substitution of Ti ion, as well as noble metal ions. Because this substitution creates longer Ti−O and M−O bonds relative to the average Ce−O bond within the lattice, the materials facilitate high oxygen storage and release. The interaction among M0/Mn+, Ce4+/Ce3+, and Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couples leads to the promoting action of CeO2, activation of lattice oxygen and high oxygen storage capacity, metal support interaction, and high rates of catalytic activity in exhaust catalysis.

1 Introduction and Background
Supported noble metal catalysts are widely used to reduce pollutants from exhausts. Auto exhaust catalyst alone is estimated to consume about 40% of platinum group metals. (1) Prominent demands on exhaust catalysts are total CO and hydrocarbon oxidation and simultaneous NOx reduction with high N2 selectivity at low temperature under fuel-lean and -rich conditions. Automotive exhaust catalysis revolves around Pt, Pd, and Rh metal nanoparticles supported on alumina and promoted by ceria and ceria−zirconia mixed oxides. (2) Noble metal atoms on the surfaces of nanometal particles in their zero-valent state are the active sites for both oxidizing and reducing molecules. Thus, catalytic activity increases with increase in metal dispersion. Atomic dispersion of noble metals on traditional supports such as Al2O3 is difficult because the metal atoms sinter into metal particles due to metal−metal bonding. Reducible oxides, TiO2 and CeO2, were therefore added to increase the metal dispersion to enhance catalytic activity. The cause for higher dispersion is not well understood. Noble metal interaction with reducible oxide supports and the promoting action of CeO2 and TiO2 has been the subject of intense research due to the importance of exhaust catalysis. (3-13) The debate on the exact nature of noble metal−support oxide interaction continues and a basic principle to design a three-way catalyst is yet to emerge.
An entirely new approach was to synthesize a uniform solid catalyst with the noble metal ion and CeO2. Noble metal oxides PtO, PtO2, PdO, and Rh2O3 are known, and therefore, it should be possible to synthesize solid solutions between CeO2 and noble metal oxides. Noble metal loading in exhaust catalysts is only to the extent of 1−2 wt %. Therefore, substitution of only 1−2% noble metal ion in CeO2 should be sufficient to make a catalyst. The underlying principle of doping aliovalent metal ion in a support oxide is to retain its parent structure as in p-type or n-type doped silicon. Thus, synthesis of single phase oxide, Ce1−xMxO2−δ (M = noble metals), is a new concept that forms a basis of noble metal ionic catalyst. Indeed, nanocrystalline Ce1−xPtxO2−δ (x = 0.01, 0.02; δ ≈ x) was synthesized, which showed much higher three-way catalytic activity compared with Pt metal dispersed on CeO2 or Al2O3. (14) Platinum is fully dispersed as ions in Ce1−xPtxO2−δ. Nanocrystalline materials provide high surface area for the catalyst. Sintering of Pt ions into Pt metal particles is avoided due to ionic repulsion. Lower valent Pt2+ ions create oxygen vacancy. The reducing (CO, H2, NH3) and oxidizing (O2, NO) molecules are adsorbed on electron-deficient Pt2+ ions and electron-rich oxide ion vacancy sites, respectively, leading to an increase in catalytic activity. (1, 14, 15) We have been following this novel approach to synthesize noble metal ionic catalysts for the last ten years. The origin of concepts in catalysis such as (a) promoting action of CeO2 and TiO2, (b) metal−support interaction, (c) activation of lattice oxygen in the support oxide, (d) high oxygen storage capacity, and (e) hydrogen spillover have been traced to the interaction of M0/Mn+, Ce4+/Ce3+, and Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couples in the noble metal ionic catalysts.
2 Synthesis of Ce1−xMxO2−δ and Ti1−xMxO2−δ by Solution Combustion Method
The synthesis of fine metal oxides by solution combustion synthesis was an accidental discovery. (16) When an aqueous solution containing stoichiometric amounts of aluminum nitrate and urea (fuel) is heated rapidly, the solution boils, froths, and burns with flame temperature ∼1500 °C yielding high surface area α-alumina in less than 3 min. We envisaged nanometal particle dispersion on alumina by the combustion of Al(NO3) and urea solution containing 1% PdCl2 or H2PtCl6 solution. The combustion of this mixture indeed gave 4−7 nm size Pd or Pt metals dispersed on α-alumina. (17, 18) When an attempt was made to disperse 1−2 atom % Pt metal in ceria by the combustion of ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN), H2PtCl6, and oxalyldihydrazide (C2H6N4O2, ODH), Pt metal particles on ceria were not present. Instead, 25−30 nm size crystallites of Ce1−xPtxO2−δ (x = 0.01, 0.02; x ≈ δ) were formed where Pt ions were in +2 and +4 oxidation states. (14)
The combustion reaction involved during the synthesis of nanocrystalline Ce1−xPdxO2−δ is (19)

Table 1 summarizes single phase oxides substituted with noble metal ions synthesized by this method. (19-22) “Bimetal ionic catalysts”, Ce1−xPtx/2Rhx/2O2−δ (x = 0.005, 0.01) have also been prepared in a single step. (23) Ti1−xMxO2−δ are synthesized by the combustion of TiO(NO3)2, metal nitrates and glycine as fuel, and sizes of metal ion doped TiO2 in anatase phase were 5−10 nm. (24, 25) As synthesized compounds are directly used as catalysts, and they do not need any postcombustion treatment.

3 Structure of Ce1−xMxO2−δ and Ti1−xMxO2−δ
The substitution of noble metals in CeO2, TiO2, and Ce1−xTixO2 is a simple extension of solid-state chemistry. Crystal structure, electronic structures, and local structure of noble metal ions and oxide ion vacancies have been determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS).
a XRD Studies
Ceria (CeO2) crystallizes in fluorite structure where Ce4+ ions are cubic close-packed with all tetrahedral voids occupied by oxygen. To establish substitution of noble metals to the extent of 1−2% in ceria lattice, high-resolution XRD data with rotating anode X-ray source was used. The Rietveld-refined XRD profile show that the R factors are less than 1%. With 2% Pd2+ ion (0.84 Å) substitution for Ce4+ (0.99 Å) in CeO2, a decrease in lattice parameter from 5.4113(2) to 5.4107(3) Å was ascertained. Diffraction lines due to Pd metal or PdO were not detectable. However, small percentage of Pd taken in the preparation may be dispersed as clusters of Pd and PdO, which are not detectable by XRD. On the contrary, in the Pd impregnated ceria catalysts, diffraction lines due to Pd metal were present. The absence of diffraction lines due to Pd metal or PdO in the combustion synthesized catalyst together with decrease in the lattice parameter indicated Pd ion substitution in CeO2. By XRD analysis, formation of Ce1−xMxO2−δ (M = Pd, Cu, Pt, Rh) (19, 26-28) and Ce1−x−yTiyMxO2−δ (M = Pt, Pd) (29, 30) phases have been confirmed. Combustion synthesized Ti1−xMxO2 crystallizes in anatase structure. (24, 25)
b Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
The combustion synthesized catalysts have been examined by TEM. (14, 26-30) For example, a high-resolution image of Pt-ion substituted Ce0.85Ti0.15O2 (Figure 2) shows only 3.2 Å lattice fringes of Ce0.85Ti0.15O2(111). X-ray emission from the lattice fringes shows the presence of 1 atom % Pt. Ring pattern is indexed to the fluorite structure. However, Pt metal impregnated on the same support oxide does show Pt nanoparticles with 2.3 Å Pt(111) as well as 3.2 Å Ce0.85Ti0.15O2(111) fringes. (29) Absence of Pt metal particle fringes and presence of Pt X-ray emission (Figure 2a,c) confirmed Pt ion substitution in Ce0.85Ti0.15O2.

c Local Structure of Noble Metal Ions by EXAFS
Substitution of Pd, Cu, Pt, and Rh ions in the CeO2 lattice is further confirmed by detailed EXAFS studies. (19, 26-28) Ce−Ce distance in CeO2 is 3.84 Å. Unique Ce−Pd, Ce−Pt, Ce−Rh, and Ce−Cu distances at 3.31, 3.28, 3.16, and 3.15 Å were observed confirming ionic substitution. These correlations (distances) are absent in either CeO2 or noble metal particles or in their oxides such as PdO, PtO2, Rh2O3, or CuO. The oxide ion vacancy created due to lower valent metal ion substitution is located next to the metal ions as seen from lower coordination of metal ions compared with Ce ion. While EXAFS experiment confirmed noble metal ion substitution in the bulk crystallites, XPS study indeed showed surface segregation of noble metal ions. (15)
d Activation of Lattice Oxygen
There is only one type of oxygen in CeO2 (Ce−O = 2.34 Å), and oxygen from the surface can be utilized for CO oxidation:
(2)
Reversibly exchangeable oxygen from the lattice is defined as oxygen storage capacity (OSC). (31) For pure CeO2, δ value is about 0.05. But OSC (δ) increased to 0.15−0.20 in the solid solution of Ce1−xZrxO2 (x = 0.25−0.3). (32-34) Oxygen in the Ce1−xZrxO2 lattice is activated even though ZrO2 cannot be reduced by CO. Zr ion has a smaller ionic radius (0.84 Å) than Ce ion (0.99 Å), and it prefers the 4 + 4 coordination instead of the 8 coordination. The EXAFS study of Ce1−xZrxO2 (x = 0.25, 0.5) indeed showed tetrahedral-like 4 + 4 coordination around both Ce and Zr ions, which was confirmed by density functional theory (DFT). (33) While metal ions in the sublattice remained cubic, the oxygen sublattice is distorted. This resulted in shorter Ce−O (2.26 Å) and Zr−O (2.03 Å) bonds and longer Ce−O (2.45 Å) and Zr−O (2.59 Å) bonds than the mean Ce−O bonds at 2.34 Å in CeO2. Similarly, in Ce1−xTixO2, Ti as well as Ce ions prefer 4 + 4 coordination with short Ti−O (1.90 Å) and Ce−O (2.30 Å) and long Ti−O (2.46 Å) and Ce−O (2.41 Å) bonds. (35) The bond distribution (36) of Ti−O and Ce−O is shown in Figure 3a. Thus, longer Ce(Zr,Ti)−O bonds created by the Zr and Ti ion substitution in CeO2 are the activated oxygen.
Figure 3

Since ionic radii of Pt2+ (0.80 Å) and Pd2+(0.84 Å) are smaller than that of Ce4+(0.99 Å), these ions also behave similar to Ti or Zr ion in CeO2. Lower valent ionic substitution creates oxide ion vacancy to balance the charges. The local structure of Pt and Pd ions in the Ce0.75Ti0.25O2 lattice has been determined. (36) Figure 3b shows the local coordination of metal ions from EXAFS. Pt has 3 (2.0 Å) + 4 (2.63 Å) coordination indicating oxide ion vacancy in its first coordination and four longer Pt−O bonds. Pd ion showed 4 (2.01 Å) +3 (2.47 Å) coordination with the oxide ion vacancy in the longer coordination shell. Ti ion has a lower coordination (4 (1.92 Å) + 3 (2.48 Å)) to account for overall oxygen deficiency. Thus, both Ti and the metal ions activate lattice oxygen. Creation of longer M−O bonds makes the metal ion more easily reducible than the corresponding metal oxide. The DFT calculations by Metiu and co-workers indeed show selective activation of oxygen in the Au-, Ag-, and Cu-doped CeO2 for CO oxidation (37) and selective promotion of different modes of methanol adsorption via the cation substitutional doping of a ZnO surface. (38)
e Electronic Structure
Oxidation states of Pt, Pd, Rh, and Cu and also the Ce and Ti in these catalysts are obtained from XPS. While cerium remains in the +4 oxidation state, Pt ions are in both +2 (85%) and +4 (15%) oxidation states in Ce1−xPtxO2−δ (x = 0.01, 0.02). (14, 26) Pt metal gets oxidized to +2 oxidation state when Pt metal nanoparticles are heated with pure nanocrystalline CeO2 in a vacuum-sealed quartz tube:
(3)
While Pt is oxidized to +2 oxidation state, Ce4+ is partially reduced to +3 oxidation state establishing redox coupling between Pt and Ce ions. (27) Combustion synthesized CeO2 is known to have 2−3% oxide ion vacancies. (39) Therefore, δ > x in Ce1−xPdxO2−δ (x = 0.01−0.02) as Pd is fully in +2 oxidation state. (14, 19) Binding energy of Pd(3d5/2) in the catalyst and in PdO are at 337.6 and 336.7 eV, respectively. Thus, Pd2+ ion is more ionic in CeO2 than in PdO. Rh in Ce1−xRhxO2−δ (28) and Cu in Ce1−xCuxO2−δ (8, 26) are fully dispersed in +3 and +2 oxidation states, respectively.
Stabilization of noble metal ions in CeO2 or TiO2 can be inferred from the relative positions of metal valence levels with respect to valence levels of CeO2 and TiO2. The valence band of TiO2 as well as CeO2 consists of the O(2p) band spread over ∼3−9 eV (Figure 4a) and the empty Ce(4f) level is located at ∼2 eV below the EF. (40) Pt, Pd, and Rh metals have high electron density at the Fermi level (Figure 4b, EF = zero of the energy scale), and the valence bands of these metals extend even up to 6 eV below EF. (41) When these metals are oxidized, Mn+(d) bands shift to higher binding energies with the effect that the Mn+(d) bands are located at about 2.5−3.5 eV below EF as in PdO (Figure 4c). In Ce1−xMxO2−δ, the Mn+(d) band lies below the Ce(4f) level but above the O(2p) band, and hence, Ce ion in the compound remains mostly in the +4 state. When metal ion in Ce1−xMxO2−δ is reduced to metal in the lattice, the metal valence level moves up toward the Fermi level, which is above the empty Ce(4f) level. Hence, electron transfer from metal to Ce4+ ion (M0 + 2Ce4+(4f0) → M2+ + 2Ce3+(4f1)) becomes facile, and the noble metals remain ionic in CeO2. Similarly, Pt and Pd ions get stabilized in TiO2 because Pt2+(5d) and Pd2+(4d) bands lie below Ti3+(3d) and above O(2p) bands. (29, 30, 42)

4 Redox Studies from Hydrogen Temperature Programmed Reduction
a Hydrogen Uptake Studies
To understand redox properties of catalysts, temperature programmed reduction (TPR) by hydrogen is employed where the volume of hydrogen consumed by the reduction of an oxide is measured. In a TPR experiment, CuO is fully reduced to Cu0 at ∼300 °C with H2/Cu = 1; on oxygen exposure, Cu0 does not get oxidized to CuO, and the process is not reversible. But, Ce0.95Cu0.05O1.95 takes up hydrogen at 200 °C with H2/Cu ratio of 2.2 with the final composition Ce4+0.83Ce3+0.12Cu00.05O1.84 where Cu2+ is reduced to Cu0 and 0.12Ce4+ ion is reduced to +3 state. On oxygen exposure, the compound gets reoxidized fully, and the TPR is reversible. Pure CeO2 takes up hydrogen at 400 °C. Therefore substitution of Cu in CeO2 activates lattice oxygen. (26) Similarly, not only Pd2+ ion in Ce1−xPdxO2−δ gets reduced but part of Ce4+ ion also gets reduced with H2/Pd > 2.5, and the process is reversible. In Ce1−xTixO2, the oxide ions are already activated due to distortion of oxide ion sublattice. Pt or Pd ionic substitution in the mixed oxide further activates the lattice oxygen. In fact, hydrogen is adsorbed at room temperature over Pt or Pd ion doped Ce1−xTixO2 with H2/Pt and H2/Pd ratios of ∼5 and ∼7.5, respectively. (29, 30)
b Hydrogen Spillover
When platinum metal is dispersed on oxide supports, more than one hydrogen atom per Pt is adsorbed, and this is known as hydrogen spillover. (43) More than five hydrogen atoms adsorbed at room temperature per Pt in Ce0.99Pt0.01O2−δ led us to study the hydrogen spillover phenomenon. (15) Over 30 times more hydrogen is adsorbed over Ce0.99Pt0.01O2−δ compared with hydrogen on Pt metal. The reason for such high H/Pt ratio is due to adsorption of protonic molecular hydrogen ion (H2δ+) on ionic Pt instead of hydridic (H−) hydrogen over Pt atoms as confirmed from NMR and DFT calculations. (44) Thus, the hydrogen spillover phenomenon is associated with ionic Pt in the support oxides.
5 Catalysis with Ionic Catalysts
The noble metal ionic catalysts were tested for various catalytic reactions, and their activities were compared with the corresponding metals supported on oxides.
a CO Oxidation
The sticking probability of CO on Pt2+ ion in Ce1−xPtxO2-δ is ∼0.12, and it is about the same on Pt metal. (14) Adsorption of CO on Pt2+ in Ce1−xPtxO2−δ is confirmed by FTIR studies. (15) CO oxidation in the presence and absence of stream oxygen and NO reduction by CO were chosen to test the catalytic activity of all the noble metal ion substituted CeO2 catalysts. (23, 26-30) In the absence of feed oxygen, CO gets oxidized to CO2 by extracting activated lattice oxygen. On exposure to oxygen, the lattice oxygen is replenished. This means that the feed oxygen gets adsorbed and incorporated in the oxide ion vacancy. Such a dual site mechanism has been used to develop kinetic models (45, 46) for CO oxidation and NO reduction with CO over these catalysts. These bifunctional models are the only cases that fit the experimental data, further confirming that there are two independent sites on the catalyst that adsorb reducing and oxidizing molecules, respectively.
Figure 5 shows the typical CO oxidation profile over Pd ion substituted ionic catalysts. Once 100% CO conversion is reached at a particular temperature, the conversion continues to be 100% at higher temperatures. The catalyst is not deactivated, and 100% conversion is obtained even after 25 h on stream. (15) A dramatic decrease in CO oxidation temperature is observed over the ionic catalyst compared with Pd impregnated catalyst. The activation energy (Ea) of CO oxidation over Ce0.99Pt0.01O2−δ and Ce0.84Pt0.01Ti0.15O2−δ is 19.6 and 13.2 kcal/mol. (29)Ea for Ce0.98Pd0.02O2−δ for the same reaction is 16 kcal/mol, and that for Ce0.73Ti0.25Pd0.02O2−δ is 13.0 kcal/mol, whereas in the case of 2% Pd metal impregnated on Ce0.75Ti0.25O2 it is 31.5 kcal/mol. (30) With Ti0.99Pd0.01O1.99, Ea is the lowest at 12.7 kcal/mol. (46) In general, rates with ionic catalysts are higher by 20−30 times compared with the same amount of metal impregnated catalysts. Among the noble Pt, Pd, and Rh metal ions, Pd ion substituted CeO2 or Ce1−xTixO2 or TiO2 showed the highest rate of CO conversion and lowest activation energy.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Percent CO conversion as a function of temperature over different Pd ionic catalysts compared with the Pd metal impregnated on CeO2. Once 100% CO is converted to CO2 at ∼80 °C with Ti0.99Pd0.01O2−δ, then 100% CO conversion continues above 80 °C.
A dual site mechanism (15, 19) of CO oxidation based on the structure of Ce1−xPtxO2−δ is compared with Langmuir−Hinshelwood mechanism on Pt metal surface in Figure 6. On the Pt ionic catalyst surface, CO is adsorbed on the electron-deficient metal ions. O2 is adsorbed on the oxide ion vacancy because the vacancy site is activated by the electron-rich environment. The size of the oxide ion vacancy is ∼2.8 Å, which can accommodate the oxygen molecule of diameter 2.42 Å. Thus, there are two distinct sites, one for reducing and one oxidizing molecules, in the ionic catalysts unlike Pt metal. Electron transfer from reducing molecules to oxygen is facilitated by the lattice via coupling between Pt2+/Pt0 and Ce4+/Ce3+ accessible redox couples. The enhanced activity is due to the creation of redox sites leading to site-specific adsorption and electronic interaction between the noble metal ions and the lattice. In addition to this, the lattice oxygen is activated in the catalyst with long M−O and Ce−O bonds, and CO can get oxidized via a Mars−van Krevelen mechanism whereby oxide ion is continuously consumed and formed. The difference in the rate of CO oxidation over different metal ion substituted catalysts should be due to differences in their redox properties.

(b) Mechanism of CO oxidation by O2 on Ce1−xPtxO2−δ: CO adsorption on Pt ion and O2 on oxide ion vacancy; electron transfer from CO to Pt ion and to O2(ad) via Ce ion; CO extracting dissociated oxygen from the vacant site or from the activated lattice oxygen forming CO2. Lattice oxygen is replenished by feed oxygen.
b NO Reduction by CO, NH3, and H2
NO is an electron donor as well as an acceptor molecule. Therefore, on the ionic catalysts depicted in Figure 6, NO can be molecularly adsorbed on noble metal ions and dissociatively chemisorbed on the oxide ion vacant sites. CO is specifically adsorbed on metal ion sites. NO adsorbed molecularly on the metal ion sites would lead to N2O formation and on the oxide ion vacant site to N2 formation. Further, N2O reduction by CO would give higher N2 selectivity. Indeed, Ce0.98Pd0.02O2−δ showed high rates of NO and N2O reduction by CO compared with Pt, Pd, and Rh metal supported catalysts. (45) N2 selectivity is more than 80% over Ce0.98Pd0.02O2−δ compared with ∼35% on Pt, Pd, and Rh metals on oxide supports. Under selective catalytic reduction conditions (with excess oxygen), high rates of NO to N2 conversion were observed over the Pd ion catalyst. On Ce0.73Ti0.25Pd0.02O2−δ, NO conversion rates and N2 selectivity are higher than on Ce0.98Pd0.02O2−δ. (30) Ti0.99Pd0.01O1.99 also shows high rates of NO conversion and high N2 selectivity, and specifically, rates of N2O reduction by CO are very high. (46) A comparison of Pt, Pd, and Rh ion substituted CeO2 showed higher catalytic activity with Pd ion than both Pt and Rh ions. (47) Thus, these studies have shown that costlier Rh, as well as Pt, metals can be dispensed in favor of Pd.
More than three hydrogen adsorptions per Pd ion in Ce1−xPdxO2−δ makes it a better catalyst for NO reduction by hydrogen, and 100% N2 selectivity is observed at low temeprature. (48) NO and N2O reduction by hydrogen over Ti0.99M0.01O2−δ (M = Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ru) have been studied, and again, Pd ion is found to be better than other metal ions. (49) Selective catalytic reduction of NO by NH3 over Ti1−xMxO2−δ (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, or Cu, x = 0.1) showed high selectivity with Fe ion. (50) With noble metal ions in TiO2, dissociation rate of NH3 is low, while Mn or Fe ion in TiO2 shows higher dissociation.
c Hydrogen−Oxygen Recombination
Pt metal is the only catalyst on which hydrogen−oxygen reaction occurs at room temperature. Since adsorption of more than three protonic type H2δ+ molecular ions per Pt2+ ion in Ce0.98Pt0.02O2−δ below room temperature and dissociative chemisorption of oxygen on oxygen vacant sites occur, rates of hydrogen−oxygen recombination are an order of magnitude higher compared with Pt metal nanocrystalline catalysts. (51, 52)
In addition to the above reactions, catalytic partial oxidation of methane, (53) water gas shift reaction, (54) and hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane at atmospheric hydrogen pressure (55) over Ce1−xPtxO2−δ have shown high rates of catalytic conversion. The conversion of methane to CO and H2 is over 95% with a very high H2/CO (1.98) over Ce1−xPtxO2−δ. Coke is not formed on this ionic catalyst, and it is resistant to poisoning due to PtC formation. Over 90% CO conversion to hydrogen occurs at 220 °C over this catalyst in the water gas shift reaction. The superiority of Au and Pt ionic catalysts for water gas shift reaction was shown earlier by Flytzani-Stephanopoulos. (56)
6 Three-Way Catalysis with Ionic Catalysts over Ceramic Honeycombs
To see whether the advantages of ionic catalysts can be exploited for exhaust catalysis, ionic catalysts were coated on cordierite honeycombs by a single-step combustion method. Epitaxial growth of CeO2 on CeAlO3 in turn grown on γ-Al2O3 is shown and forms adhesion of CeO2 to γ-Al2O3. (57) Coating of γ-Al2O3 on cordierite honeycomb is achieved by the same combustion method. Ionic catalyst is grown on the γ-Al2O3-coated ceramic honeycomb by a dip−dry−combustion method, and advantages of ionic catalysts for automotive catalysis have been demonstrated. (58)
7 Summary and Future Outlook
The catalytic activity of noble metal ion substituted in reducible oxide is much higher than the corresponding metal particles supported on oxides. We have studied Pt, Pd, Rh, and Cu metal ions substituted in CeO2, TiO2, and Ce1−xTixO2. Pd ion substituted oxides are the best three-way catalysts for automotive exhaust applications.
Noble metal ions in a number of new oxide supports such as Ce1−xAxO2 (A = Ti, Zr, Hf, Th,) can be developed. Substitution of first row transition metal ions in CeO2 are amenable to redox coupling between M(3d) and Ce(4f). There are a number of other reducible oxide supports such as SnO2 or V2O5. Redox properties of noble metal ions in first row transition metal oxides are not yet explored. Understanding the redox behavior of reducible metal oxides doped with more easily reducible noble metal ions would be a worthwhile area to pursue in catalysis combined with solid-state chemistry.

Figure 6. (a) L−H mechanism of CO + O2 reaction on Pt metal surface; dissociation of oxygen due to expansion of O−O bond. (b) Mechanism of CO oxidation by O2 on Ce1−xPtxO2−δ: CO adsorption on Pt ion and O2 on oxide ion vacancy; electron transfer from CO to Pt ion and to O2(ad) via Ce ion; CO extracting dissociated oxygen from the vacant site or from the activated lattice oxygen forming CO2. Lattice oxygen is replenished by feed oxygen.
