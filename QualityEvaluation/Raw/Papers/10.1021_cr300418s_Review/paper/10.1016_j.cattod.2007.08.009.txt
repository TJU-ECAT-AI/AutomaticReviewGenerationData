Abstract
The present article will highlight some recent experimental and theoretical studies of both unpromoted MoS2 and promoted Co–Mo–S and Ni–
Mo–S nanostructures. Particular emphasis will be given to discussion of our scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), density functional theory
(DFT), and high-angle annular dark-ﬁeld scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) studies which have provided insight into
the detailed atomic structure. In accordance with earlier theoretical studies, the experimental studies show that the Ni–Mo–S structures may in
some instances differ from the Co–Mo–S analogues. In fact, the Co–Mo–S and Ni–Mo–S structures may be even more complex than previously
anticipated, since completely new high index terminated structures have also been observed. New insight into the HDS mechanism has also been
obtained and complete hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis pathways for thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) have been calculated on the type of
structures that prevail under reaction conditions. It is seen that important reaction steps may not involve vacancies, and special brim sites are seen to
play an important role. Such studies have also provided insight into inhibition and support effects which play an important role in practical HDS.
Recent STM studies have shown that MoS2 clusters below 2–3 nm may exhibit new structural and electronic properties, and a large variety of size-
dependent structures have been identiﬁed. In view of the large structure sensitivity of hydrotreating reactions this is expected to give rise to large
effects on the catalysis.

1. Introduction
In recent years, new legislation regarding the sulfur content
in transport fuels has resulted in the demand for ultra low sulfur
diesel (ULSD), and this has introduced new challenges for
hydrodesulfurization (HDS) in the reﬁning industry [1–9]. In
addition, the demand for diesel fuels is increasing, and as the
availability of light petroleum resources decreases, increasingly
heavy feedstocks have to be reﬁned. In order to achieve the
higher sulfur conversion, very refractory sulfur compounds,
like dialkylated dibenzothiophenes (DBT), need to be removed
[1,3–6,10]. It has been known for some time that the conversion
of the sterically hindered DBTs mainly proceeds via a pre-
hydrogenation route (HYD) rather than the direct desulfuriza-
tion route (DDS), which dominates for molecules like DBT [3].
However, under industrial conditions, the presence of other
compounds in the feed often changes the relative role of the
HYD and the DDS pathways. In particular, speciﬁc basic
nitrogen-containing
compounds
inhibit
HDS,
and
these
compounds are observed to mainly inhibit the HYD pathway
[11–13]. Furthermore, H2S is an HDS inhibitor, and interest-
ingly, it mainly inhibits the DDS rather than the HYD pathway
[1]. To improve HDS catalysts and gear them to the
increasingly heavy feedstocks, detailed understanding of their

mechanistic action is necessary so that targeted modiﬁcations
can be made.
In order to elucidate the HDS reaction and the two different
HYD and DDS pathways in detail, it is important to
characterize the active nanostructures and in particular to
identify the active sites for the two pathways. Until the early
1980s, very little information was available on the structure of
active hydrotreating catalysts. A key discovery was the
identiﬁcation of the MoS2 and Co–Mo–S structures by EXAFS,
Mo
¨ssbauer and infrared techniques, and it was shown that the
Co–Mo–S structure was responsible for the promotion of
catalytic activity [14–18]. These results revealed that Co–Mo–S
(and also Ni–Mo–S) structures are small MoS2-like nanocrys-
tals, where the promoter atoms are located at the edges of the
MoS2 layers. The results furthermore suggested that Co atoms
are located in the same plane as Mo, but that their local
coordination is different. In spite of the signiﬁcant progress, it
was for a long-time difﬁcult to address the issue of the detailed
edge structure of unpromoted and promoted MoS2, as no
atomic-resolved structures could be obtained. As a conse-
quence, it has also been difﬁcult to understand the nature of
HYD and DDS pathways and sites. Recently, we have achieved
a large breakthrough in the structural studies of the active
nanostructures in HDS using scanning tunnelling microscopy
(STM) to image the real-space structure of MoS2 nanoclusters
grown on ﬂat model substrates. With the STM, it was possible
for the ﬁrst time to reveal the equilibrium morphology of the
nanoclusters. Furthermore, atomic-resolution STM images
made it possible to elucidate the detailed structure of the
catalytically important edges, the sulfur coverage and the
location of sulfur vacancies, which are normally considered to
be active sites [19]. In further studies, we have also managed to
synthesize and characterize the atomic-scale structure of Co–
Mo–S and Ni–Mo–S and thereby it has been possible to obtain
information on the location of the Co and Ni promoter atoms
[20,21]. Recently, MoS2, WS2 and promoted structures were
studied by another new technique, high-angle annular dark-
ﬁeld scanning tunnelling electron microscopy (HAADF-
STEM), and additional information on the morphology
of MoS2- and WS2-based nanostructures could be obtained
[22–24]. In most of the STM studies, gold was used as a support
of the sulﬁde nanostructures. Since gold is a weakly interacting
support, the studies have provided important insight into the
intrinsic properties of the nanostructures. In industrial HDS
catalysts, the support usually plays a signiﬁcant role and the
STM studies have recently been extended to carbon-supported
systems [25]. Many earlier studies have indicated that
hydrotreating reactions are extremely sensitive structure [1].
One may therefore expect that the reactions will depend
strongly on the particle size, but not much has been known
about such effects. Recently, STM has for the ﬁrst time
provided us with atom resolved images of MoS2 clusters of
different sizes [26]. Many size-dependent structural and
electronic changes were observed and such effects must
clearly also be taken into account when addressing the
catalysis.

First principles modelling techniques, like density func-
tional theory (DFT), have over the last decade provided
increasing insight into atomic structure and reactivity of the
active phases of HDS catalysts. DFT can often provide
information that is complementary to the multitude of
experimental information, and the synergy of theoretical and
experimental approaches can thus give a very detailed picture
of catalyst structure and reactivity. After our initial studies of
Co–Mo–S [27–29], we have recently used this approach in a
series of studies, where STM and DFTwere combined to obtain
insight into the structure of unpromoted and promoted MoS2
under different conditions [30–33,21]. The general approach of
combining DFT with the chemical potential of the gas phase
can be used to connect DFT calculations performed at 0 K and
in vacuum to reaction conditions with relevant temperatures
and pressures [34–39].
The very powerful combination of STM experiment and
DFT calculations has led to several important ﬁndings in our
studies, and one of the most signiﬁcant results was the
discovery of the so-called brim states and their role in HDS
catalysis. It was found that the Mo edge exhibits a special
electronic edge state, which can easily be identiﬁed in STM
images of the nanoclusters as a very bright brim extending
along the edges (see e.g. Fig. 1). These brim states arise from a
perturbation of the electronic structure near the edges relative to
the interior part of the clusters. Detailed analysis using DFT
revealed the presence of edge states, which are metallic states
that are localized at the cluster edges and give rise to the brim
states [30]. Quite surprisingly, it was observed that these states
possess reactivity towards the hydrogenation of thiophene,
which could be observed using STM [31,32]. Thus, insight into
these
sites
is
essential
for
understanding
hydrotreating
reactions.
The ever increasing computational power makes it possible
to study increasingly complex systems, and in recent years a
number of reports on catalyst-support interactions have been
published [40–44]. Also, the reaction pathway of thiophene and
thiophene derivatives on MoS2 have been studied by us [45] and
several other groups [46–49] and thus, we can begin to
understand reaction pathways and ﬁnd descriptors for catalytic
activity.
In this review, we will highlight some of the above-
mentioned developments. In Section 2, we discuss the recent
STM and DFT studies of promoted CoMoS and NiMoS
structures as well as HAADF-STEM studies on unpromoted
and promoted MoS2 and WS2. In Section 3, we summarize the
results concerning support interactions and in Section 4 we
discuss recent developments concerning reaction pathways and
inhibition. In Section 5, recent STM results regarding size
effects are described.
2. Structure of MoS2, Co–Mo–S and Ni–Mo–S
According to the now well-accepted Co–Mo–S model for
the promoted MoS2 hydrotreating catalysts, the Co and Ni
promoter atoms are located at edge positions of MoS2
nanostructures. Their substitution of Mo at edge sites is
believed to enhance vacancy formation and the creation of new
and more active sites. Several studies have been carried out to
correlate the structure of the active promoted phases to the
activity [1,15,17], but the exact location and coordination of the
promoter atoms have been debated extensively [1,14,50–54].
Lack
of
structural
insight
has
hampered
the
progress.
Consequently, the origin of the promoting effect of Co and
Ni is still not fully understood, and in particular it has been
interesting to resolve the origin of the different speciﬁc
selectivities with respect to hydrodesulfurization (HDS),
hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrogenation (HYD) for
the two types of promoted systems [1,3,4,8,10,55].
Following the initial STM studies of unpromoted MoS2
nanoclusters [19], we have used STM to reveal the atomic scale
structure of both Co–Mo–S [20] and more recently Ni–Mo–S
[21]. Fig. 1 shows the STM images of Co–Mo–S and Ni–Mo–S
nanoclusters. One can see that the main indicator of the
formation of promoted Co–Mo–S and Ni–Mo–S phases is a
distinct change in morphology compared to the unpromoted
MoS2 nanoclusters, which under similar synthesis conditions
have
a very
regular
triangular shape. This
change
in
morphology is concluded to be mainly driven by the preference
for the promoter atoms (Co and Ni) to substitute certain sites. In
many instances, there is a preference for the substitution at the
ð¯
1 0 1 0Þ S edges of MoS2 rather than at the ð1 0 ¯
1 0Þ Mo edges
which under similar conditions are the only edges exposed in
the unpromoted triangular clusters.
The above situation is illustrated for Co–Mo–S in Fig. 1a,
which shows that the nanocluster adopts a clear hexagonally
truncated shape, indicating that both ð1 0 ¯
1 0Þ Mo edges and
ð¯
1 0 1 0Þ S edges are present. One type of edge in the Co–Mo–S
structure is found to be identical to that observed for the
unpromoted MoS2 triangles [19], with the outermost row of
protrusions out of registry with the basal plane S atoms and a
clear bright brim along the edge. This type of edge can therefore
be identiﬁed as a ð1 0 ¯
1 0Þ Mo edge. The other edges must
according to the symmetry be the ð¯
1 0 1 0Þ S edges. This type of
edge is seen to exhibit an even brighter brim structure in which
individual protrusions can be identiﬁed. The periodicity of one
lattice distance along the brim indicates that Co atoms have
replaced all Mo atoms at the S edge creating a ð¯
1 0 1 0Þ Co–Mo–
S edge. It is, however, not straightforward to identify the exact
edge structure and sulfur termination exclusively from STM
images. We have therefore performed DFT calculations to
identify the edge termination of the ð¯
1 0 1 0Þ Co–Mo–S edges
[21], and simulated STM images show that only a 50% sulfur
covered edge is consistent with the experimental STM images.
Furthermore, this theoretical analysis reveals that a metallic
edge state (brim state) is responsible for the very bright brim
observed at the promoted edge. This resulting local structure
around the Co atoms is in good agreement with previous
spectroscopic measurements [51,56,57].
The edge truncation effects observed in the STM studies are
more complex for the Ni–Mo–S nanoclusters [21]. In addition,
the nature of the truncation for the Ni–Mo–S system was seen to
depend on the cluster size. The larger type A clusters are
characterized by a hexagonally truncated shape similar to that

88
of the Co–Mo–S nanoclusters (See Fig. 1b). The smaller type B
clusters, on the other hand, have a more complex dodecagonal
morphology (See Fig. 1). The Ni–Mo–S type A structures are
terminated by two types of edges. As for the Co–Mo–S case, the
Ni–Mo–S type A clusters expose both an unpromoted ð1 0 ¯
1 0Þ
Mo edge and a new ð¯
1 0 1 0Þ Ni–Mo–S edge structure, in which
Ni has fully substituted all edge Mo sites. In order to understand
the structure and properties of this edge in detail, we have again
used DFT. The DFT-based simulated STM images show that
only an edge with 50% sulfur coverage is energetically
favourable and consistent with the experimental images. The
structure of Ni–Mo–S type A, which is depicted in the ball
model in Fig. 1b, is thus similar to that of Co–Mo–S. The DFT
calculations of the ð¯
1 0 1 0Þ Ni–Mo–S edge show that the bright
brim observed with STM is related to two distinct Ni–Mo–S
metallic edge states. One of the metallic Ni–Mo–S edge states
is similar to the one in Co–Mo–S, but the other one has no MoS2
or Co–Mo–S counterpart [21,30] and it is possible that this edge
state plays a catalytic role and is responsible for differences in
catalytic activity and selectivity between Co–Mo–S and Ni–
Mo–S. The smaller dodecagonally shaped type B Ni–Mo–S
clusters (Fig. 1c) are structurally more complicated and are seen
to be terminated by three different types of edges. Two of the
edge types can be identiﬁed as the same fundamental types as
the ð1 0 ¯
1 0Þ Mo edge and the ð¯
1 0 10Þ Ni–Mo–S edge also
found in the type A Ni–Mo–S clusters. However, the STM
images show bright protrusions on the Mo edges indicating that
Ni atoms also have substituted at Mo edge sites creating
ð1 0 ¯
1 0Þ Ni–Mo–S edges (Fig. 1c). Comparing the experi-
mental STM images with simulated STM images from DFT, we
conclude that type B ð1 0 ¯
1 0Þ Ni–Mo–S edges have a partial
substitution of Mo by Ni, and only the parts of the edge with
alternating Mo–Ni sections are seen to have sulfur adsorbed
[21]. The last type of edge present in type B Ni–Mo–S is
associated with a high-index ð1 1 ¯
2 0Þ edge. The presence of
such edges is quite surprising, since previously, such edges have
not been considered as stable edge terminations in Co–Mo–S or
Ni–Mo–S structures. The STM experiments and the HAADF-
STEM measurements discussed below are the ﬁrst experi-
mental evidence that such edges may be present under sulﬁding
conditions.
The presented observations suggest that the promoting role
of Co and Ni may be two-fold. The change in the electronic
structure as indicated by the modiﬁed brim and the lower S
coordination on the promoted ð¯
1 0 1 0Þ Ni–Mo–S edges may be
an attractive situation enabling adsorption of sulfur-containing
molecules. Furthermore, the presence of Ni–Mo–S type B
clusters clearly demonstrate that there may be major differences
in the morphologies of Co–Mo–S and Ni–Mo–S catalysts
exposed to similar sulﬁding environments, and this may be a
key to explain the different selectivities of the two systems in
the hydrotreating processes.
Recently, we have employed high-angle annular dark-ﬁeld
scanning transmission electron miscroscopy (HAADF-STEM)
to obtain morphological information on unpromoted and
promoted WS2 and MoS2 structures and to gain more insight
into the changes induced by the promoter atoms [22–24].
Traditionally, researchers have been using high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) to obtain mor-
phological insight into HDS catalysts [58–72]. However, it has
been difﬁcult to get such insights from HRTEM measurements
since single S–Mo–S layers are typically only imaged when
they are oriented approximately edge-on relative to the electron
beam, i.e. the layers are viewed as lines in the images. In
contrast, HAADF-STEM uses electron scattering at high angles
to create a Z-contrast image with Z denoting the atomic number.
This situation is especially advantageous for heavy elements
and in the ﬁrst study [22], we investigated WS2/C catalysts and
observed that even single WS2 layers could be imaged with the
beam along the c-axis. In this way, the morphology of the layers
could be directly imaged. In accordance with the STM results,
we observed that the shape of the nanostructures may deviate
signiﬁcantly from the hexagonal morphology observed for bulk
crystals. Recently, we have applied this method to MoS2, Co–
Mo–S and Ni–Mo–S structures [24] and some of the resulting
HAADF-STEM pictures are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that
in spite of the high sulﬁding temperature (1073 K), many of the
single layer clusters still contain irregularities and defects,
which distinguish them from the much more regular STM
images of MoS2 on Au(1 1 1). Also in industrial catalysts, the
structures may have defects and layers are often curved [1]. It
should be remarked that the clusters observed here are larger

line of observation. The image (c) displays accidental overlap of clusters located along the same line of observation, possibly clusters located at opposite sides of the
same graphite sheet. Adapted from Ref. [24].

than the ones in the STM study on Au(1 1 1). We ﬁnd that most
of the imaged clusters are single-layer clusters, as also shown
by edge-on images presented in [22]. For the unpromoted MoS2
structures, we ﬁnd that the predominant shape is a truncated
hexagon. From comparison with the STM images of MoS2 on
Au(1 1 1) [19] and with DFT calculations on edge stability
[38], one can assume that predominantly Mo edges are exposed
and they therefore correspond to the longer edges observed in
the images. The promoted Co–Mo–S and Ni–Mo–S structures
were also investigated and they are depicted in Fig. 2b and c,
respectively. In accordance with the STM results it is found that
promotion changes the morphology of the nanoclusters and that
their shape becomes signiﬁcantly more hexagonal. Further-
more, some of the hexagons appear with rounded corners,
which indicate that high-index edge terminations are exposed
also in the case of Co–Mo–S. These results differ from the Co–
Mo–S and Ni–Mo–S structures on Au(1 1 1) studied by STM
[21], where only Ni–Mo–S was observed to expose higher-
index edge terminations. This difference may be due to the
different supports as well as different preparation and
sulﬁdation methods. The STM samples have been prepared
by gas phase metal deposition onto a gold surface, whereas the
HAADF-STEM samples have been prepared by impregnation
of carbon powder followed by sulﬁdation. It is not surprising
that the choice of such methods may greatly inﬂuence the
structure of the catalyst [1]. However, considering the different
synthesis methods and supports, it should be emphasized that
many of the observed structure and the morphology changes
induced by Co and Ni in the STM and HAADF-STEM
experiments are rather similar. Regarding the possible role of
the support, it should be noted that we recently have studied
MoS2 structures on graphite by STM [25], and these results are
discussed in the following section.
3. Support interactions
The role of support interactions has been an important topic
in catalysis research for many years, since the catalytic
properties of MoS2 are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the support
[1]. The most common support is high-surface area alumina,
since it allows for the production of small stable nanoclusters of
MoS2. Preparation conditions inﬂuence the activity signiﬁ-
cantly, e.g. it has been observed that an increase in sulﬁdation
temperature resulted in the formation of modiﬁed Co–Mo–S
structures [73], which had a signiﬁcantly higher activity than
those prepared at lower temperatures. These structures were
termed Type II Co–Mo–S as opposed to the Type I Co–Mo–S
structures formed at lower temperatures. Extensive character-
ization studies using EXAFS, FTIR and a multitude of other
techniques [74–78] have suggested that Type I Co–Mo–S
structures contain Mo–O–Al linkages with the support, whereas
no such linkages are present in Type II structures. The Co
promoter atoms are not involved in the formation of these
linkages, as could be shown by Mo
¨ssbauer spectroscopy
[79,80]. Many studies have shown that catalysts with Type II
structures often contain multilayer Co–Mo–S nanoclusters. In
this case, only the layers close to the support may be bound to
the latter by linkages, whereas the other layers only interact
weakly by van der Waals forces and thus exhibit Type II-like
activity. One way to avoid the Type I linkages is to increase the
sulﬁdation temperature, but this has a number of unwanted side
effects, e.g. sintering and loss of surface area. A different
approach is to avoid the formation of linkages altogether and
form directly Type II structures, and several studies have shown
that this indeed is possible e.g. by the use of chelating ligands or
additives [80–82]. It has also been shown that Type II structures
may dominate when employing weakly interacting supports as
e.g. carbon [1].
It is of signiﬁcant interest to understand these support effects
in detail, and theoretical modelling with density functional
theory has been of great use to investigate these aspects. A few
earlier [40,41] and several recent studies [43,44] have
investigated support effects by modelling promoted and
unpromoted MoS2-based cluster structures on different facets
of g-Al2O3, and in the latter studies different adsorption
geometries and conﬁgurations were mapped out in great detail.
Such investigations are complicated further by the fact that the
precise location of non-spinel sites in g-Al2O3 is not completely
known and still under discussion [83–87].
In a recent study [42], we have investigated a simpliﬁed
system, where we modelled the linkages by hydroxyl groups,

concentrating exclusively on the chemical impact of support
linkages without considering steric issues. We found that
linkages have a thermodynamic preference for the S-edge, as
illustrated in Table 1 and Fig. 3. Furthermore, vacancy
formation, both at the linkage sites themselves and in the
immediate vicinity, is energetically much more expensive and
therefore not favoured. We also found that the electronic
structure of the linkage sites as well as hydrogen adsorption
differs signiﬁcantly from that of the S-edge without linkages.
These ﬁndings could explain several experimental observa-
tions: In previous high temperature sulﬁdation studies [16,79] it
was found that the temperature at which the support linkages
can be broken, i.e., the Type I to Type II transition temperature,
depends on the Co loading. For low Co content, the Type I to
Type II transition takes place at a higher temperature than for
high Co content, and for unpromoted MoS2, the transition was
not observed at all in the employed temperature region.
Combining our results with the results that Co primarily is
located at the S-edge (see previous section), these results are
easy to understand: Linkages and Co are likely not located at
the same site, and therefore at high Co content (or higher
coverage of the S-edge by Co), there are fewer linkages that
have to be broken and thus the transition temperature is lower.
In some systems, the transition occurred at the temperature at
which edge saturation had occurred. This simpliﬁed support
interaction model thus allowed us to gain some insight into
important phenomena which had remained unexplained for two
decades. The results also showed that the linkages may also
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the brim sites which play an important
role in the catalysis (see Section 4).
The choice of substrate can be, as discussed above, used as a
means of inﬂuencing catalyst structure and properties, and in
this regard, graphite is highly interesting since Type II
structures are formed [88] and indeed, carbon-supported
MoS2-based hydrotreating catalysts exhibit a very high HDS
reactivity [88,18,89,90]. This motivation has recently led us to
apply STM to investigate the atomic-scale structure and
morphology of MoS2 nanoclusters synthesized on a graphite
(HOPG) substrate [25]. Due to a very weak bonding and high
mobility of Mo to the graphite it was not possible to synthesize
highly dispersed MoS2 clusters on the clean single crystal
HOPG surface. Instead, a HOPG substrate, pretreated by ion
bombardment, was used since this created a low density of
surface defects capable of stabilizing well-dispersed nanoclus-
ters. Not surprisingly, both the crystallinity, morphology, and
stacking of the MoS2 nanostructures were found to be
dependent on the subsequent annealing temperature. Clusters
synthesized at 1000 K consist predominantly of a single
S–Mo–S layer, whereas the clusters synthesized at 1200 K
exclusively grow as stacked multilayer clusters containing
typically 2–6 S–Mo–S layers. Atom-resolved STM images of
both the single- and multilayer clusters reveal a well ordered
MoS2 basal plane structure in the interior consisting of
hexagonally arranged protrusions with an average interatomic
spacing of 3.15 A
˚ , in perfect agreement with the interatomic
spacing of the S atoms in the (0 0 0 1) basal plane of bulk
MoS2.
The
preferential
shape
of
small
single-layer
MoS2
nanoclusters is observed to be hexagonal (see Fig. 4). However,
the morphology of large single-layer clusters is signiﬁcantly
more complex due to pinning of the cluster edges to defects.
Such effects were also observed by HAADF-STEM [22–24].
The interface structure between the S–Mo–S layer and the
HOPG is obtained in atomic detail in the STM images of the
single-layer clusters. In this way it was possible to pinpoint the
anchoring sites of the MoS2 nanoclusters as surface defects
preferentially located directly underneath the nanoclusters
edges and not the basal plane.
The multilayer clusters are also predominantly shaped as
hexagons (See Fig. 4b). This is not surprising since adjacent
layers, in the 2H stacking commonly encountered in bulk
MoS2, are translated and rotated 608 around the c-axis. The
result is that Mo atoms in one layer are placed on top of S atoms
in the next layer and a multilayer cluster will therefore expose
Mo edges and S edges in an alternation fashion, and any
difference in edge free energy thus tends to cancel out.

The top layer of the multilayer clusters is not perturbed by
the defects in the HOPG and can thus be used to obtain
interesting atom-resolved information. One of the two edge
types has the outermost row of protrusions out of registry with
the basal plane S atoms and a clear bright brim along the edge
(Fig. 4c). This type of edge is thus completely identical to the
edges observed for the unpromoted MoS2 triangles [19] and this
type of edge is therefore identiﬁed as a Mo edge fully saturated
with sulfur dimers. Importantly, the atom-resolved STM
images provide solid evidence for one-dimensional metallic
brim sites on the graphite-supported MoS2, which as discussed
further in Section 4 play an important role in the catalytic
properties of single-layer MoS2 [31,32]. Thus the brim sites are
not special for the gold supported systems but likely to be an
important feature of all MoS2- and WS2-based catalysts on
different supports.
The other type of edge must according to the symmetry be a
S edge (Fig. 4d). This type of edge was not previously observed
under the same sulﬁding conditions for the Au supported
system, since only Mo edges are exposed for the single layer
MoS2 triangles under such conditions [19]. However, the
appearance of the edge with the outermost row of protrusions in
registry with the basal plane S atom and clearly resolved
protrusions along the brim resembles the S edges imaged for
hexagonal MoS2 clusters synthesized in a mixture of H2 and
H2S [33]. The S edges formed under these conditions are fully
sulﬁded with hydrogen adsorbed in the form of S–H groups
[34,38,91,33]. The similarities suggest that the multilayer
clusters also expose this kind of S edges and it thus seems
plausible that the intensity variation observed along the brim
(Fig. 2d) is due to a partial hydrogen adsorption. The
observation of hydrogen adsorbates at the clusters edges is
highly interesting from a catalytic point of view, since both
adsorption of the S-containing molecule and dissociation of H2
are required to facilitate the HDS reaction, as will be discussed
further in the following section.
4. Hydrogenation and direct desulfurization reaction
routes
As discussed in Section 2, STM images have clearly
revealed that MoS2, Co–Mo–S, and Ni–Mo–S expose bright
brims at the edges [19,20,21]. Using DFT, these brims have
been shown to be the result of one or more metallic edge states
[30,38]. Combined STM and DFT studies have investigated
thiophene HDS over MoS2 particles at STM conditions, and it
was found that fully sulﬁded MoS2 particles which have a
bright brim are able to hydrogenate thiophene and make 2,5-
dihydrothiophene. Furthermore, it is important to note that at
these sites one is also able to break one S–C bond and thereby
produce cis-2-butenethiolate [31,32]. These studies indicate
that brims can play a role in hydrogenation reactions and also in
S–C scission reactions. Contrary to the general view in the
previous literature, the results show that S–C scission may
occur without the involvement of vacancies.
In a recent DFT study [45], we have further investigated the
HDS reactions of thiophene over MoS2. In order to make the
studies of direct relevance for actual HDS, we have as starting
point used the edge conﬁgurations corresponding to actual HDS
conditions. The study clearly shows that there may be several
HYD and DDS pathways on the ð1 0 ¯
1 0Þ Mo and the ð¯
1 0 10Þ S
edges. The structure of MoS2 is very dependent on reaction
conditions [34–39] and the structure at HDS conditions (seen in
Fig. 5) may therefore be quite different from that present at
vacuum conditions for STM imaging. However, it was found
that the brim sites consisting of metallic edge states are also
present at HDS conditions [38].
The reaction scheme obtained from our DFT study is
depicted in Fig. 5. In general, we ﬁnd that the active site at the S
edge is most likely a vacancy site whereas the active site at the
Mo edge is a brim site and not a coordinatively unsaturated site
[45]. It is important to note that the brim sites are present at the
equilibrium edge conﬁguration under HDS conditions, while

the S edge vacancy site ﬁrst needs to be created from the
equilibrium structure. For this creation of the vacancy site, it
was found that the effective energy barrier for vacancy
formation depends on the hydrogen pressure. Investigating the
HYD pathway it was found that hydrogenation and H transfer
steps have lower barriers at the Mo edge brim site than at the S
edge vacancy sites. In contrast, the S–C scission reactions have
lower barriers at the S edge. Furthermore, thiophene prefers to
be adsorbed at the Mo edge while the intermediates prefer to
adsorb at the S edge vacancy site.
The investigated HYD pathway proceeds via thiophene
adsorption, followed by hydrogenation to 2-hydrothiophene,
and further hydrogenation to 2,5-dihydrothiophene and then
subsequent S–C scission. The DDS pathway is initiated by
hydrogenation to 2-hydrothiophene which is then immediately
followed by S–C scission. The relative importance of the S edge
and the Mo edge in HDS of thiophene was found to depend on
reaction conditions and the different possible reaction pathways
have been summarized in Fig. 5. The HYD pathway may occur
at the Mo edge brim site without involving a coordinative
unsaturated site as seen in Fig. 5. Therefore, the Mo edge brim
site is able to both hydrogenate thiophene and break S–C bonds.
The HYD pathway may also proceed via prehydrogenation and
hydrogenation at the Mo edge brim site, diffusion to the S edge
and then S–C scission at the S edge vacancy site. The S–C
scission reactions have lower barriers at the S edge and the
intermediates bind more strongly but the number of active sites
is much lower since vacancies need to be created prior to
reaction. The edge interaction between the Mo edge and the S
edge will probably be of importance at high hydrogen pressures
or low H2S pressures where the vacancy coverage at the S edge
is signiﬁcant. The S edge vacancy site was also found to be the
primary site for the S–C scission in the DDS pathway. The
crucial step is for both the HYD and the DDS pathway proposed
to be the active site regeneration. It was therefore proposed that
an activity descriptor could be the minimum energy required to
either add or remove S from the equilibrium edge structures.
The identiﬁcation of the Mo edge brim site as the
hydrogenation site explains the low inhibiting effect of H2S
on hydrogenation as found in many studies [1,92], since H2S
does not bind to the fully coordinated brim sites. Inhibition of
HDS by nitrogen-containing compounds is of central impor-
tance in practical HDS of many feedstocks [1,8,93]. In
particular, it has been shown that basic heterocyclic compounds
as e.g. pyridine primarily inhibit the HYD pathway of the HDS
reaction [94,95]. This is especially important, as there is an
increasing demand for deep desulfurization, where sterically
hindered alkyl substituted molecules like 4,6-DMDBT have to
be desulfurized. In these molecules, access to the sulfur is
sterically hindered and HDS of the pure component proceeds
primarily via the HYD route [3], and thus there is an interest to
avoid inhibition of especially this route. Furthermore, under-
standing of inhibition, by e.g. pyridine, offers the opportunity to
gain further insight into where the reactive sites are located. For
non-sterically hindered heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen
in a six-membered ring, as for instance pyridine, it has been
observed that the inhibitor strength and the gas phase proton
activities are correlated [12,96]. Aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g.
benzene also primarily inhibit the HYD route, but their effect is
much weaker than for e.g. pyridine.
In a recent study [97], we investigated the effects of the three
different inhibitors pyridine, benzene and H2S. We found that
pyridine itself only adsorbs weakly on the Mo edge, but in the
presence of hydrogen under HDS conditions, pyridine becomes
protonated. The resulting pyridinium ion adsorbs strongly on
the Mo-edge and forms a chemical bond to the surface, as
shown in Fig. 6. It should be noted that the pyridinium ion
interacts with the special brim sites that, as discussed above,
also are involved in the HYD reaction [30]. Interestingly, it was
found that protonation of pyridine does not take place at the S
edge, as hydrogen itself is too strongly bound to this edge and
thus not available. Benzene and H2S only bind weakly to both
edges, which explains why their inhibition effect is much lower
than pyridine. These results also point to the Mo edge primarily

being the active site for the HYD pathway, and the results
support that the brim sites seem to play a special role.
5. Size effects
It is well-known that materials scaled down to particles in
the nanometer regime may adopt new and interesting structural
and electronic properties that are signiﬁcantly different from
those observed in bulk systems [98]. Numerous studies have
shown that this also may lead to unique catalytic properties. For
example, catalysts based on gold nanoparticles supported on a
metal oxide have indeed been shown to exhibit interesting size-
dependent activities for low temperature oxidation reactions
[99]. In a ‘‘nanocatalysis’’ context this is often highlighted as a
prototype system since bulk gold is noble and catalytically
inert. We have recently revealed that very strong structure-size
effects also exist for MoS2 nanoclusters catalysts, and such
effects are expected to inﬂuence the hydrogenation and
hydrodesulfurization activities of MoS2 nanoclusters in this
size regime [26]. Fig. 7 shows a series of atom-resolved STM
images of seven single-layer MoS2 nanoclusters with varying
size. It should be noted that all clusters with the same size
exhibit similar images. The large variation in the images of
different size clusters demonstrates that for each cluster size
there appears to be a ‘‘unique’’ minimum energy structure. The
STM images also provide information on how the electronic
structure like the brim sites vary with changing cluster size, and
the results clearly show that the smallest clusters do not possess
extended metallic states. The four largest clusters all adopt the
structure described in Section 2 and in the previous studies
[19,30], and these clusters are terminated by fully sulﬁded Mo
edges. For the triangular clusters with less than six Mo atoms on
the edge (n  6), the edge structure appears differently and also
the appearance of the interior of the cluster becomes brighter
and different from that of normal basal planes. In Ref. [26], the
structural changes were suggested to be caused by a
rearrangement of the cluster edges in response to an increase
of the S:Mo ratio for the smallest nanoclusters. Even in the
fairly large nanoclusters (n = 8), a large ‘‘excess’’ of sulfur
exists (S:Mo  2.89 for n = 8). If the edge structure remains
constant, smaller clusters would have S:Mo ratios greater than
three. In Ref. [26], it was noted that the large excess of sulfur
can be avoided by exposing different edges (see ball models in
Fig. 7). Thus, it was suggested in Ref. [26] that below a given
cluster size a complete inversion of the edge structure may take
place. Furthermore, for very small clusters (n  4) indications
for spontaneous formation of sulfur vacancies were noted [26]
and the edge structure may be described as a 75% S covered S
edge. Importantly, this scenario illustrates that the bonding
energy of sulfur in the clusters and thus the tendency to form the
catalytically important sulfur vacancies on the cluster edges
could exhibit a signiﬁcant variation with cluster size. A detailed
analysis of the images and a deconvolution of the structural and
electronic effects await a full DFT-STM study. Nevertheless,
even without a detailed interpretation, the present results
clearly show that small MoS2 clusters have interesting new
structural and electronic properties. In view of the discussion in
the previous sections, such clusters will undoubtedly also
exhibit novel and very different catalytic properties and it will
be an interesting challenge to prepare and investigate systems
containing such clusters with well-deﬁned sizes.
6. Conclusions and outlook
Using a combination of novel experimental and theoretical
techniques like STM, DFT and HAADF-STEM, we have
recently gained further insight into structure, support, size and
reactivity effects in hydrotreating catalysis. One picture which
emerges from these studies is the important concept of the
special ‘‘brim sites’’, which we have shown to exhibit catalytic

size, where n denotes the number of Mo atoms on the cluster edge. Lower part: Ball models (top view) associated with the MoS2 triangles observed by STM and the

activity for hydrogenation reactions. This is quite contrary to
the common belief that vacancy sites are the key active sites,
since the brim sites are not coordinatively unsaturated sites.
Nevertheless, the emerging picture is shown to be consistent
with many inhibition steric and poisoning effects which have
been difﬁcult to interpret using a ‘‘vacancy model’’. DFT
calculations have helped us gain detailed insight into the HDS
of thiophene under industrial conditions, and it is suggested that
the hydrogenation reactions take place on the brim sites,
whereas the sulfur removal can take place at both edges.
Furthermore, the results reveal how the promoters Co and Ni
change the morphology of the nanoparticles, and recently
several novel forms of the Ni–Mo–S and Co–Mo–S type
structures have been observed. Using STM, also unique size
dependent structures of MoS2 have been observed and these
changes also result in signiﬁcant variations in the electronic
structure of the clusters. In the future, the new experimental and
theoretical tools should be able to provide further insight into
the structure sensitivity and size effects and the studies should
be able to reveal how structural and morphological changes
give rise to changes in the catalytic activity.
