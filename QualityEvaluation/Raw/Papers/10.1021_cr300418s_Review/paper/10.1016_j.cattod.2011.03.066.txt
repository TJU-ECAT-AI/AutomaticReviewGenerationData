An  Ir-in-CeO2 catalyst

 of  CO,  and  the effects  of
 the  formed

 were  studied  by  a pulse  calorimetry.
 A  volcano-like

 between
the

 The  presence
 of  oxygen  vacancy
is
 favorable
 for  CO  oxidation,
 with  the  best  activity  when
 1.5%  amount
 of
 oxygen  vacancy  is
 obtained.
However,
 the activity  decreases
 with  further  increase
 of oxygen
 vacancy.
 A
 quantitative
 analysis
 of  the
reaction
 process  suggests
 that the
 increase
 of  oxygen
 vacancy
 promotes
 the  buildup  of  strongly
 adsorbed
carbonates,
 leading
 to  the  prohibition
 of  the  adsorption
 and  activation
 of
 CO
 but  not  O2. The  reduced
supply
 of  adsorbed
 CO  to react  with  oxygen
 species  may  result  in  the  decreasing
 activity  with more
oxygen
 vacancy.

 Introduction
CO
 oxidation
 on
 ceria-based
 catalysts
 has
 been
 extensively
 stud-
ied
 during
 the
 past
 decades,
 due
 to
 the
 high
 capacity
 of
 ceria
 to
 store
and
 release
 oxygen
 as
 a
 reducible
 support
 [1–4].
 Recently,
 a
 debate
about
 the
 role
 of
 ceria
 in
 CO
 oxidation
 is
 ongoing.
 The
 reversible
 for-
mation
 of
 oxygen
 vacancy
 (Ov)
 on
 the
 activated
 ceria
 was
 thought
to
 operate
 in
 its
 catalytic
 cycle.
 The
 catalysts
 with
 noble
 metal
 (NM)
encapsulated
 by
 ceria
 can
 still
 behave
 a
 high
 activity
 even
 without
the
 direct
 participation
 of
 the
 NM
 [5–9].
 It
 has
 been
 proposed
 that
the
 addition
 of
 NM
 weakened
 the
 surface
 Ce–O
 bond
 strength
 and
promoted
 the
 formation
 of
 Ov,
 which
 became
 the
 active
 sites.
Reactive
 oxygen
 removal
 from
 ceria
 with
 formation
 of
 Ov
 is
 a
well
 known
 step
 during
 CO
 oxidation,
 concomitant
 with
 the
 tran-
sient
 CO2 formation
 [10–12].  The
 presence
 of
 Ov
 was
 generally
helpful
 for
 the
 activation
 of
 O2 [13,14]. It
 was
 suggested
 that
 CO
can
 react
 with
 these
 active
 oxygen
 species
 to
 produce
 carbonates,
which
 would
 affect
 CO
 oxidation,
 either
 as
 a
 reaction-intermediate
or
 as
 a
 spectator
 staying
 steady
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 Ov
 [15–18].
However,
 there
 were
 few
 studies
 to
 quantify
 the
 amount
 of
 Ov
 of
ceria-based
 catalysts
 and
 further
 correlate
 it
 with
 the
 activity
 of
 CO

 That
 is,
 little
 attention
 was
 paid
 to
 ﬁnd
 the
 optimum
Ov
 content
 of
 the
 catalyst
 in
 its
 active
 state.
Our
 previous
 work
 has
 suggested
 that
 CO
 oxidation
 progressed
on
 the
 activated
 ceria
 of
 an
 Ir-in-CeO2 sample
 (most
 of
 iridium
encapsulated
 by
 ceria)
 and
 reductive
 pretreatment
 increased
 its
activity,
 indicating
 the
 important
 role
 of
 Ov
 [9,20].
 In
 this
 study,
 we
investigated
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 CO
 pretreatment
 on
 this
 Ir-in-CeO2
sample.
 With
 pretreatment
 by
 pulses
 of
 CO,
 different
 amounts
 of
Ov
 and
 carbonates
 were
 obtained
 and
 their
 effects
 on
 CO
 oxidation
were
 in
 turn
 studied.
 A
 volcano-like
 relationship
 between
 Ov
 and
the
 activity
 of
 CO
 oxidation
 was
 established,
 the
 reasons
 of
 which
were
 then
 investigated
 by
 analysis
 of
 the
 transient
 process
 during
CO
 oxidation.

 Experimental
2.1.
 Catalyst
 preparation
The
 Ir-in-CeO2 catalyst
 was
 prepared
 by
 a
 redox
 co-precipitation
method,
 as
 described
 previously
 [9].  An
 aqueous
 solution
 of
 H2IrCl6
and
 Ce(NO3)3 was
 added
 to
 a
 heated
 NaOH
 solution
 (353
 K)
 to
form
 a
 black
 precipitate.
 After
 aging
 for
 2
 h,
 the
 suspension
 was
suction
 ﬁltered
 and
 washed
 with
 deionized
 water
 several
 times
until
 no
 Cl−was
 detected
 by
 AgNO3.
 Thereafter,
 the
 solid
 mate-
rial
 was
 dried
 at
 333
 K
 overnight
 and
 ﬁnally
 calcined
 at
 673
 K
 for
2
 h.
 The
 powder
 sample
 was
 pressed,
 crushed,
 sieved
 with
 a
 size
of
 20–40
 mesh
 for
 characterization.

 Catalyst
 characterization
Temperature
 programmed
 reduction
 of
 CO
 (CO-TPR)
 was
 per-
formed
 in
 a
 quartz
 microreactor,
 and
 about
 100
 mg  of
 a
 sample
 was
used
 in
 each
 measurement.
 The
 calcined
 sample
 was
 pretreated
under
 He
 ﬂow
 at
 393
 K
 for
 2
 h
 and
 then
 cooled
 down
 to
 313
 K.
The
 ﬂow
 of
 5%
 CO
 in
 He
 (50
 mL  min−1)
 was
 then
 switched
 into
the
 system
 and
 the
 sample
 was
 heated
 up
 to
 1023
 K
 at
 a
 rate
 of
3
 K
 min−1.
 CO,
 CO2,
 and
 H2 in
 the
 outlet
 gas
 were
 measured
 by
 a
mass
 spectrometer
 (MS)
 OminiStar
 equipped
 with
 the
 software
quadstar
 32-bit.
 CO
 and
 H2 signals
 were
 calibrated
 by
 using
 5%
CO/He
 and
 10%
 H2/Ar,
 respectively.
 CO2 signal
 was
 calibrated
 by
a
 pulse
 of
 pure
 CO2 with
 a
 ten-port
 pulsing
 valve.
 The
 signals
 of
 CO,
H2,
 and
 CO2 evolved
 during
 the
 measurement
 were
 determined
from
 the
 MS
 and
 the
 ﬂow
 rate
 of
 reducing
 agent.
Temperature
 programmed
 oxidation
 of
 O2 (TPO)
 was
 done
 in
 the
similar
 type.
 The
 calcined
 sample
 was
 pretreated
 by
 pulses
 of
 CO
 at
673
 K
 and
 then
 cooled
 down
 to
 313
 K.
 The
 2%
 O2 in
 He
 (50
 mL  min−1)
was
 then
 switched
 into
 the
 system
 and
 the
 sample
 was
 heated
 up
to
 1073
 K
 at
 a
 rate
 of
 10
 K
 min−1.
 The
 signals
 were
 also
 detected
 by
a
 MS
 OminiStar
 just
 as
 described
 in
 CO-TPR
 characterization.
The
 pulse
 calorimetric
 technique
 is
 composed
 of
 a
 calorime-
ter
 (HT-1000
 calorimeter,
 Seteram,
 France)
 coupled
 with
 a
 pulse
reactor
 system,
 which
 has
 been
 described
 in
 detail
 in
 our
 previ-
ous
 work
 [21].
 The
 calorimeter
 response
 was
 calibrated
 using
 a
standard
 joule
 calibrator.
 In
 a
 typical
 experiment,
 100
 mg
 of
 a
 sam-
ple
 (mcat.)
 was
 placed
 in
 the
 sample
 vessel
 while
 the
 reference
vessel
 was
 empty.
 The
 stainless
 steel
 plumbing
 system
 attached
to
 the
 equipment
 enables
 an
 identical
 ﬂow
 of
 gas
 through
 them.
The
 efﬂuents
 were
 analyzed
 by
 a
 gas
 chromatography
 (GC
 Agilent
6890N).
 The
 percentage
 of
 reactants
 adsorbed
 or
 reacted
 (xa)
 was
determined
 quantitatively
 from
 the
 change
 in
 the
 peak
 areas
 of
reactants
 injected
 and
 eluted.
 In
 the
 pretreatment,
 a
 limited
 num-
ber
 of
 CO
 pulses
 were
 injected
 at
 673
 K
 and
 the
 pretreated
 sample
was
 denoted
 as
 Ir-in-CeO2-xp
 with
 x
 as

The

 of

 Results
 and
 discussion
3.1.
 Surface
 behavior
 during
 CO
 pretreatment
As
 depicted
 in
 Fig.
 1,
 CO2 is
 released
 with
 repeated
 pulses
 of
 CO
on
 Ir-in-CeO2,
 correspondingly
 with
 the
 accumulation
 of
 residual
carbon
 species,
 might
 as
 graphite-like
 ones
 or
 carbonates.
 There
are
 several
 possible
 explanations
 for
 the
 surface
 behavior
 during
CO
 pretreatment.
1. CO
 reaction
 with
 OH
 groups
 on
 the
 surface.
2.
 Disproportionation
 reaction
 of
 CO.
3. CO
 reaction
 with
 the
 lattice
 oxygen
 provided
 by
 the
 CeO2 and
the
 remaining
 as
 a
 form
 of
 carbonates.
As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 2,
 the
 temperature
 of
 CO2 released
 is
 in
 accord
with
 that
 of
 CO
 consumed
 during
 CO-TPR
 of
 CeO2 and
 Ir-in-CeO2,
and
 only
 negligible
 amounts
 of
 H2O
 and
 H2 were
 detected
 cor-
respondingly.
 If
 CO
 reacts
 with
 the
 OH
 groups
 to
 produce
 CO2,
according
 to
 hypothesis
 1,
 there
 would
 be
 a
 reasonable
 amount
of
 H2O
 or
 H2 released
 [23,24].  This
 is
 not
 the
 case,
 however.
 This
observation
 implies
 that
 the
 concentration
 of
 OH
 group
 is
 not
 high
enough
 or
 the
 OH
 group
 is
 not
 easy
 to
 react
 with
 CO
 on
 Ir-in-CeO2.
The
 production
 of
 CO2 might
 also
 come
 from
 the
 CO
 dispropor-
tionation
 reaction
 according
 to
 hypothesis
 2.
 This
 can
 complicate
the
 quantiﬁcation
 of
 Ov
 by
 calculating
 the
 amount
 of
 released
 CO2.
We
 pretreated
 the
 Ir-in-CeO2 by
 pulses
 of
 CO
 at
 673
 K
 until
 few
 CO2
was
 released.
 The
 remained
 carbon
 species
 in
 this
 pretreatment
were
 ascertained
 by
 checking
 the
 temperature
 for
 CO2 production
in
 the
 process
 of
 TPO.

 with

 main
 peak
 centered
 at
 386
 K.
 If
 CO
 disproportion-
ation
 reaction
 took
 place,
 the
 removal
 of
 the
 residual
 carbon
 species
(mainly
 as
 graphite-like
 ones)
 required
 a
 temperature
 higher
 than
950
 K
 [10,25].
 However,
 such
 a
 weak
 intensity
 of
 CO2 produced
 at
around
 900
 K
 in
 the
 TPO
 experiment
 led
 us
 to
 conclude
 that
 the
 CO
disproportionation
 made
 neglectable
 contributions
 to
 CO2 forma-
tion.
 Therefore,
 most
 of
 the
 remaining
 carbon
 species
 stayed
 in
 a
form
 of
 carbonates.
The
 conclusion
 reached
 from
 above
 observations
 was
 that
 the
formation
 of
 Ov
 and
 carbonates
 predominated
 during
 CO
 pretreat-
ment
 as
 depicted
 from
 the
 hypothesis
 3.
 This
 is
 convenient
 for
 us
 to
quantify
 the
 formation
 of
 Ov
 by
 the
 released
 amount
 of
 CO2 and
 cor-
respondingly
 the
 accumulation
 of
 carbonates
 with
 pretreatment
 by
pulses
 of

 by
pulses
 of

 related
 with
 the
 pretreated
 number
 of
 CO
 pulses.
As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 4,
 the
 released
 amount
 of
 CO2 per
 pulse
 of
 CO
 +
 O2
increases
 with
 the
 pretreated
 number
 from
 0
 to
 2.
 However,
 this
amount
 decreases
 with
 further
 increasing
 pretreated
 pulse
 num-
ber
 of
 CO,
 although
 the
 amount
 of
 Ov
 under
 steady
 state
 increases
correspondingly.
 The
 catalytic

 is
 best
 on
 the
 Ir-in-
CeO2-2p
 sample
 with
 about
 1.5%
 Ov

 under
 steady

 Revealing
 the
 reasons
 for
 the

 loss
 with
 more
pretreated
 number
 of
 CO

The
 presence
 of
 Ov
 is
 favorable
 for
 CO
 oxidation
 on
 ceria-
based
 catalysts.
 However,
 the
 volcano-like
 relationship
 between
the
 amount
 of
 Ov
 and
 the
 yield
 of
 CO2 reminds
 us
 that
 the
 for-
mation
 of
 Ov
 might
 not
 be
 the
 sole
 factor
 for
 the
 change
 of
 its
activity.
 Thus
 it
 is
 indispensable
 to
 further
 study
 the
 effects
 of
 these
pretreatments
 on
 CO
 oxidation.
 The
 Ir-in-CeO2-2p
 and
 Ir-in-CeO2-
8p
 samples
 were
 selected
 and
 compared
 in
 order
 to
 ﬁnd
 out
 the
reasons
 for
 the
 decreasing
 activity
 of
 CO
 oxidation
 with
 more
 pre-
treated
 number
 of
 CO

 O2,
 CO,
 and
 CO2 adsorption
 on
 Ir-in-CeO2-2p
 and
Ir-in-CeO2-8p
To
 address
 the
 effects
 of
 Ov
 and
 carbonates
 on
 the
 catalytic
activity,
 we
 ﬁrst
 studied
 the
 adsorption
 behaviors
 of
 O2,
 CO,
 and
CO2 with
 the
 pulse
 number
 on
 the
 Ir-in-CeO2-8p
 and
 Ir-in-CeO2-
2p
 samples
 at
 393
 K
 by
 the
 pulse
 calorimetry.
 The
 results
 are
shown
 in
 Fig.
 5
 and
 Table
 2.
 With
 the
 pulses
 of
 O2,
 a
 little
 CO2 is
released,
 attributed
 to
 the
 behavior
 of
 oxygen-assisted
 decomposi-
tion
 of
 carbonates.
 The
 initial
 adsorption
 heat
 and
 the
 saturation
uptake
 of
 O2 are
 391
 kJ
 mol−1 and
 42.5
 mol
 on
 Ir-in-CeO2-8p
while
 342
 kJ
 mol−1 and
 15.0
 mol
 on
 Ir-in-CeO2-2p,
 indicating
 that
the
 presence
 of
 more
 Ov
 is
 favorable
 for
 O2 adsorption
 and
 acti-
vation.
 Unexpectedly,
 the
 adsorption
 of
 CO
 is
 largely
 prohibited,
with
 the
 adsorption

 and

 of
 only

 relative
 to
 that
 of
 146
 kJ
 mol−1 and
3.4

 on
 Ir-in-CeO2-2p.
 The
 CO2 adsorption
 heat
 on
 Ir-in-CeO2-
8p
 (115
 kJ
 mol−1)
 is
 higher
 than
 that
 on
 Ir-in-CeO2-2p
 (96
 kJ
 mol−1),
although
 the
 saturation
 uptakes
 of
 CO2 are
 similar.
 The
 CO2 was
usually
 adsorbed
 in
 a
 form
 of
 carbonates
 over
 ceria-based
 cata-
lysts
 [12,26].
 Thus,
 it
 suggests
 that
 on
 Ir-in-CeO2-8p,
 there
 appeared
more
 Ov,
 the
 existence
 of
 which
 leads
 to
 the
 strong
 adsorption
 of
the
 carbonates.
3.3.2.
 Successive
 pulses
 of
 CO
 +
 O2 at
 393
 K
The
 formation
 of
 more
 Ov
 was
 favorable
 for
 the
 adsorption
 of
O2 but
 led
 to
 the
 prohibition
 of
 CO
 adsorption
 and
 activation.
 On
the
 other
 hand,
 it
 improved
 the
 adsorption
 strength
 of
 carbonates.
The
 Ov
 and
 carbonates
 were
 both
 involved
 in
 the
 process
 of
 CO
oxidation
 [15,16].  We  then
 described
 the
 process
 of
 CO
 oxidation
before
 the
 steady
 state
 by
 exposing
 the
 freshly
 pretreated
 catalysts
to
 successive
 pulses
 of
 CO
 +
 O2 (2:1).
 The
 CO-,
 O2-,
 and
 CO2-related
quantities
 were
 shown
 as
 well
 as
 the
 heat
 evolved
 from
 the
 initial
state
 to
 the
 steady
 state.
Fig.
 6
 displays
 the
 reaction
 process
 when
 the
 Ir-in-CeO2-8p
 was
subjected
 to
 pulses
 of
 CO
 +
 O2 at
 393
 K.
 In
 the
 1st
 or
 2nd
 pulse
 of
reactants,
 few
 CO2 is
 released.
 The
 pronounced
 high
 amount
 of
O2 is
 consumed,
 indicating
 the
 overreduction
 of
 ceria
 compared
with
 that
 under
 steady
 state,
 and
 the
 additional
 oxygen
 supply
 to
decrease
 Ov
 content.
 Meanwhile,
 the
 lower
 consumption
 of
 CO
 is
found.
 Nevertheless,
 the
 consumption
 amount
 of
 CO
 (2.3
 mol
 for
the
 ﬁrst
 pulse)
 is
 higher
 than
 the
 saturation
 adsorption
 amount
of
 CO
 (1.0
 mol
 as
 shown
 in
 Table
 2),
 indicative
 of
 the
 reaction
 of
CO
 with
 adsorbed
 O2.
 The
 difference
 between
 CO2 formation
 and
CO
 consumption
 can
 be
 ascribed
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 carbonates
[27].
 The
 initial
 heat
 of
 354
 kJ
 mol−1 is
 a
 little
 lower
 than
 that
 of
 O2
adsorption
 (391
 kJ
 mol−1),
 indicating
 the
 preferential
 activation
 of
O2 rather
 than
 CO.
 In
 the
 subsequent
 3rd
 to
 10th
 pulse,
 both
 the
amounts
 of
 released
 CO2 and
 adsorbed/reacted
 CO
 increase
 sig-
niﬁcantly.
 It
 should
 be
 noted
 that
 the
 amount
 of
 released
 CO2 is
even
 higher
 than
 that
 of
 consumed
 CO.
 This
 indicates
 that
 part
 of
CO2 is
 produced
 by
 the
 decomposition
 of
 the
 pre-adsorbed
 car-
bonates.
 Correspondingly,
 the
 decreasing
 evolved
 heat
 with
 pulses
of
 reactants
 could
 result
 from
 the
 endothermic
 step
 of
 carbon-
ates
 decomposition
 other
 than
 the
 direct
 reaction
 of
 adsorbed
 CO
with
 oxygen
 species.
 However,
 it
 is
 unexpected
 that
 the
 consump-
tion
 amounts
 of
 CO
 and
 O2 simultaneously
 decrease
 after
 10th
pulse
 of
 CO
 +
 O2.
 Generally,
 the
 temperature
 (K)
 for
 desorption
of
 adsorbed
 species
 nearly
 equates
 four
 times
 of
 adsorption
 heat

 corresponding
 temperature
 for

orption
 of

 calculated
 from
 the
 initial
 adsorption
 heat
of
 CO2 on
 Ir-in-CeO2-8p
 is
 around
 460
 K,
 which
 is
 higher
 than
 the
reaction
 temperature
 (393
 K)
 of
 CO
 oxidation.
 This
 indicates
 some
carbonates
 irreversibly
 adsorb
 on
 this
 sample.
 Therefore,
 some
 of
the
 reactive
 sites
 may
 be
 covered
 by
 these
 carbonates,
 resulting
 in
the
 decreased
 yield
 of
 CO2.
 After
 16th
 pulse
 of
 CO
 +
 O2,
 the
 quan-
tity
 intensities
 show
 a
 stoichiometric
 and
 steady
 consumption
 of
the
 reactants
 and
 a
 corresponding
 amount
 of
 CO2 formation.
 The
evolved
 heat
 keeps
 a
 constant
 of
 around
 185
 kJ
 mol−1,
 consistent
with
 the
 enthalpy
 of
 direct
 reaction
 between
 CO
 and
 O2 [21,30].
Comparatively,
 the
 situation
 is
 different
 on
 Ir-in-CeO2-2p.
 As
shown
 in
 Fig.
 7,
 the
 consumption
 amount
 of
 O2 remains
 6.5
 mol
per
 pulse
 of
 reactant.
 The
 adsorbed/reacted
 amount
 of
 CO
 is
 higher
than
 that
 on
 Ir-in-CeO2-8p.
 In
 spite
 of
 the
 initial
 prohibition
 on
CO
 adsorption
 and
 activation
 by
 pre-accumulation
 of
 carbonates,
more
 and
 more
 CO
 is
 activated
 and
 transformed
 to
 CO2 with
 pulses
of
 reactants
 before
 the
 steady
 state
 for
 CO
 oxidation.
 The
 initial
 heat
is
 about
 250
 kJ
 mol−1 for
 the
 1st
 pulse,
 and
 then
 slowly
 decreases
to
 around
 180
 kJ
 mol−1 until
 the
 6th
 pulse.
 Compared
 with
 that
on
 Ir-in-CeO2-8p,
 the
 corresponding
 temperature
 for
 desorption
 of
carbonates
 on
 Ir-in-CeO2-2p
 calculated
 from
 the
 initial
 adsorption
heat
 of
 CO2 was
 only
 384
 K,
 lower
 than
 the
 reaction
 temperature.
Thus,
 the
 carbonates
 can
 reversibly
 adsorb
 and
 do
 not
 prohibit
 the
reaction
 of
 CO
 with
 O2 under
 steady
 state
 on
 Ir-in-CeO2-2p.
 Cor-
relating
 with
 the
 results
 in
 Table
 1,
 the
 amount
 of
 Ov
 1.5%
 and
carbonates
 0.08
 MLs
 coverage
 might
 be
 proper
 to
 promote
 CO
 oxi-
dation.
For
 CO
 oxidation
 on
 ceria-based
 catalysts,
 Ov
 sites
 are
 chemi-
cally
 active
 and
 play
 an
 important
 role.
 A
 junction
 effect,
 arising
from
 the
 contact
 between
 ceria
 and
 a
 metal
 with
 high
 work
 func-
tion,
 has
 been
 suggested
 to
 explain
 the
 high
 activity
 of
 NM-in-CeO2
catalysts,
 on
 which
 the
 easily
 formed
 Ov
 becomes
 the
 active
 sites
[31,32].
 Although
 not
 absolutely
 excluding
 the
 possibility
 of
 the
contribution
 of
 few
 exposed
 metal
 Ir
 sites,
 our
 results
 in

 show
a
 clear
 relationship
 between

 Not
 a

 increase
 of

 with
the
 Ov
 but
 the
 best
 performance
 of
 CO
 oxidation
 with
 1.5%
 Ov  is
found.
 The
 pulse
 calorimetric
 studies
 show
 that
 the
 adsorption
 and
activation
 of
 CO
 but
 not
 O2 is
 prohibited
 with
 more
 Ov.
 The
 analy-
sis
 of
 transient
 step
 of
 CO
 oxidation
 suggests
 that
 the
 prohibition
 of
CO
 adsorption
 and
 activation
 is
 probably
 caused
 by
 the
 buildup
 of
carbonates.
 Moreover,
 the
 strongly
 adsorbed
 carbonates,
 accom-
panied
 with
 more
 Ov,
 would
 decrease
 the
 catalyst
 activity
 under
steady
 state.
 This
 might
 be
 explained
 by
 a
 reaction
 scheme
 in
 which
the
 supply
 of
 adsorbed
 CO
 (COad)
 to
 react
 with
 oxygen
 species
 is
reduced
 due
 to
 these
 strongly
 adsorbed
 carbonates,
 as
 the
 temper-
ature
 needed
 for
 carbonates
 desorption
 is
 higher
 than
 the
 reaction
temperature
 on
 Ir-in-CeO2-8p.
 This
 process
 closely
 resembles
 the
reasons
 leading
 to
 the
 deactivation
 of
 Au/TiO2 sample,
 on
 which
the
 accumulation
 of
 carbonates
 decreased
 the
 local
 density
 of
 COad
and
 correspondingly
 the
 amount
 of
 CO2 by
 an
 in
 situ
 DRIFTS
 study
[33].
 In
 order
 to
 further
 demonstrate
 the
 effects
 of
 carbonates
 on
CO
 oxidation,
 we
 also
 studied
 the
 surface
 behavior
 of
 Au-in-CeO2,
which
 has
 been
 extensively
 studied
 for
 CO
 oxidation.
 Unlike
 Ir-
in-CeO2,
 the
 pretreated
 number
 of
 CO
 pulses
 does
 not
 affect
 the
ﬁnal
 activity
 on
 Au-in-CeO2 under
 steady
 state.
 This
 is
 in
 accord
with
 the
 recent
 data
 from
 a
 temporal
 analysis
 of
 products
 reactor,
showing
 that
 the
 ﬁnal
 activity
 under
 steady
 state
 does
 not
 depend
on
 the
 method
 of
 oxygen
 removal
 for
 Au/CeO2 catalyst
 [19].
 The
initial
 adsorption
 heat
 of
 carbonates
 on
 Au-in-CeO2 pretreated
 by
8
 pulses
 of
 CO
 was
 only
 90
 kJ
 mol−1,
 thus
 the
 carbonates
 could
 eas-
ily
 desorb
 at
 393
 K.
 Then
 the
 supply
 of
 COad is
 not
 prohibited,
 and
the
 catalyst
 activity
 does
 not
 decrease
 with
 more
 pretreated
 num-
ber
 of
 CO
 pulses.
 Therefore,
 the
 adsorption
 strength
 of
 carbonates
remains
 a
 decisive
 factor
 to
 affect
 the
 catalyst
 performance
 under
steady
 state.
 The
 buildup
 of
 strongly
 adsorbed
 carbonates
 prohibits
the
 adsorption
 and
 activation
 of
 CO,
 leading
 to
 the
 deactivation
 of
the
 Ir-in-CeO2 catalyst.
4.
 Conclusions
The
 activation
 of
 Ir-in-CeO2 by
 pulses
 of
 CO
 pretreatment
 for
CO
 oxidation
 was
 studied.
 The
 formation
 of
 Ov
 and
 carbonates
 is
one-step
 achieved
 during
 this
 pretreatment.
 By
 injecting
 pulses
 of
reactants
 onto
 these
 pretreated
 samples,
 we
 observed
 a
 volcano-
like
 relationship
 between
 Ov
 and
 catalyst
 activity
 under
 steady
state.
 The
 presence
 of
 1.5%
 Ov
 is
 best
 but
 more
 amount
 of
 Ov
 leads
to
 the
 decreasing
 activity.
 The
 adsorption
 strength
 of
 carbonates
plays
 a
 crucial
 role
 on
 the
 change
 of
 this
 activity.
 The
 prohibition
 of
CO
 oxidation
 with
 more
 Ov
 may
 result
 from
 the
 decreased
 supply
of
 adsorbed
 CO
 to
 react
 with
 oxygen
 species
 due
 to
 the
 buildup
 of
strongly
 adsorbed
 carbonates.
