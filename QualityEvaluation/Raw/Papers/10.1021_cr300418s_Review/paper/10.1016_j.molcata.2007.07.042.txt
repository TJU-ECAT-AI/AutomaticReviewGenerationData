Abstract
The precipitation and impregnation methods in the preparation of chromium-doped magnetite for water gas shift reaction (WGSR) were compared
in this work. This reaction is an important step in the commercial production of highly pure hydrogen from natural gas or naphtha feedstocks. It was
found that the preparation method affects both the textural and catalytic properties of chromium-doped magnetite. However, chromium was able to
preserve the speciﬁc surface area during the WGSR and to delay the metallic iron production, independently of the preparation method. Chromium
caused a decrease in activity per area, depending on the preparation method. This fact was assigned to its ability in making the production of
Fe2+ species more difﬁcult, making the catalytic sites less active, because the redox cycle of the reaction becomes more difﬁcult. The most active
catalyst was obtained by adding chromium by impregnation, which led to a large amount of total chromium in the solid and then a catalyst with
high speciﬁc surface area was produced. It was showed that the catalysts can be prepared in the active phase avoiding the reduction step, before
reaction.

1. Introduction
It is well-known [1] that the preparation method of the cata-
lysts has a strong inﬂuence on their ﬁnal properties. In addition,
the reactivity of the solids largely depends on the nature and
on the concentration of the imperfections that can be gener-
ated during their preparation. Therefore, several factors such as
concentration, pH, temperature, aging time and kind of anions
can affect the ﬁnal product [2]. Concerning iron oxides, several
works have been carried out to state the effect of the prepara-
tion method on the properties of these catalysts [2,3]. With this
goal in mind, the precipitation and impregnation methods in the
preparation of chromium-doped magnetite (Fe3O4) were com-
pared in this work. The characteristics of the solids produced
were related to their catalytic activity in water gas shift reaction
(WGSR).

In recent years, the WGSR has attracted increasing interest
mainly because of its application in fuel cells [4]. By WGSR,
the hydrogen production from steam reforming is increased and,
most importantly, the hydrogen stream is puriﬁed by the removal
of carbon monoxide which often poisons most of metallic cata-
lysts, including the platinum electrocatalyst for fuel cells [4,5].
The water gas shift reaction: CO + H2O ⇄CO2 + H2 has
been widely investigated for different purposes, for instance,
for ammonia synthesis and hydrogenation reactions. Thermo-
dynamically, the WGSR is favored by low temperatures and
excess of steam, since it is exothermic (H = −41 kJ mol−1) and
reversible. However, high temperatures are required for indus-
trial applications and thus the reaction is carried out in two
steps in commercial processes: a high temperature shift (HTS)
in the range of 643–693 K and a low temperature shift (LTS)
at around 503 K. The HTS step is typically performed over an
iron oxide-based catalyst while the LTS stage is carried out over
a copper-based one. The most used HTS catalyst is chromium-
doped hematite (-Fe2O3), which is reduced in situ to produce
magnetite (Fe3O4), the active phase. In this exothermic reduc-

tion, the production of metallic iron should be avoided, since it
can promote undesirable reactions such as methanation, carbon
monoxide disproportionation reactions [6] and Fischer-Tropsch
synthesis [7,8]. In addition, hydrogen is consumed in the pro-
cess and theexothermicnatureofthesereactionscanproducehot
spots in the reactor and also the weakness and physical damage
to catalyst pellets [9].
In industrial plants, the process gas (carbon monoxide and
dioxide, hydrogen, methane and argon), from the reforming con-
verters, is used to perform this reduction and large amounts
of steam are added to the gas feed, in order to ensure the
magnetite stability. However, this procedure increases the oper-
ational costs. Therefore, there is a demand for more stable
catalysts that could avoid the iron reduction to metallic state
and thus do not need an excess of steam [5]. It is expected that
a catalyst prepared in the active phase can inhibit the reduction
step and save energy in industrial processes. With this goal in
mind, the precipitation and impregnation methods were com-
pared, with the aim of preparing HTS catalysts in the active
form.
2. Experimental
2.1. Sample preparation
In the precipitation method, an ammonium hydroxide solu-
tion (25%, m/v) was slowly added by a pump, at room
temperature, to an iron nitrate (1 M) and chromium nitrate
(0.1 M) solutions, previously mixed, to get the MCP sample.
In the impregnation method, the ammonium hydroxide solution
was added to the iron nitrate solution to produce a gel which was
further impregnated with the chromium nitrate solution, for 24 h
(MCI sample). The sol produced was centrifuged and the gel was
washed with an ammonium acetate solution 5% (w/v) to remove
the nitrate ions and to promote the sorption of acetate species,
responsible for the magnetite formation [5,10]. The solid was
dried at 393 K and heated under nitrogen ﬂow (100 mL min−1)
at a rate of 10 K min−1 up to 773 K, and kept at this temperature
for 2 h, to produce the catalysts. Pure magnetite was also pre-
pared by the method described, which was used as a reference
(M sample).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The catalysts were characterized by chemical analy-
sis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray
diffraction
(XRD),
speciﬁc
surface
area
measurements,
temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) and M¨
ossbauer spectroscopy.
The iron and chromium contents were determined by energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in a Shimadzu model
EDX-700HS equipment. The presence of acetate groups in the
samples was conﬁrmed by FTIR, using a Perkin Elmer model
Spectrum One equipment, in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. The
XRD powder patterns of the solids were obtained in a Shi-
madzu model XD3A equipment, using a Cu K (λ = 1.5420 ˚
A)
radiation and nickel ﬁlter, with 2θ ranging from 10◦to 80◦.
The speciﬁc surface area measurements were carried out by
the BET method in a Micromeritics model TPD/TPR 2900
equipment, using a 30% N2/He mixture. The sample was pre-
viously heated (10 K min−1) up to 433 K, under nitrogen ﬂow
(60 mL min−1) being kept at this temperature for additional
30 min. The TPR proﬁles were obtained using the same equip-
ment. The samples (0.05 g) were reduced at a temperature
rangingfrom303upto1273 K,at10 K min−1,undera5%H2/N2
mixture.
The XPS spectra were obtained with a VG Scientiﬁc spec-
trometer, Escalab model 220i-XL, with X-ray source, Mg K
(1253 eV) anode and 400 W power, with a hemispheric electron
analyzer. This reference was, in all cases, in good agreement
with the BE of the C 1s peak, at 284.6 eV.
The M¨
ossbauer spectra, at 298 K, were measured in trans-
mission geometry with a 512-channel constant acceleration
spectrometer. A source of 57Co in an Rh matrix of nominally
50 mCi was used. Velocity calibration was performed against
a 12 m-thick -Fe foil. All isomer shifts (δ) are referred to
this standard at room temperature. The spectra were folded to
minimize geometric effects, being evaluated using a commercial
computer ﬁtting program named Recoil.
2.3. Catalysts evaluation
The catalysts were evaluated using 0.2 cm3 of powder 100
mesh size and a ﬁxed bed microreactor operating at 643 K, 1 atm
and WHSV = 12,000 h−1, for 6 h. A gas mixture (10% CO, 10%
CO2, 60% H2 and 20% N2) and a steam to gas molar ratio
of 0.6 were used. These conditions were chosen to achieve a
10% conversion (far from the equilibrium value, 46%) using
a commercial catalyst (chromium-doped hematite) and also to
avoid any diffusion effect. After each experiment, the reactor
with the catalyst was cooled under nitrogen (with traces of oxy-
gen) until reaching room temperature, to avoid the pyrophoric
effects [4,11]. The spent catalysts were analyzed by XRD, spe-
ciﬁc surface area measurements, M¨
ossbauer spectroscopy and
XPS.
3. Results and discussion
The FTIR spectra of the samples before heating, shown in
Fig.1(a),conﬁrmedthepresenceofacetategroupsbytheabsorp-
tion bands at 1550 and 1430 cm−1 [12]. The spectra also show
bands at 3400 and 1380 cm−1, assigned to hydroxyl and nitrate
groups, respectively [13,14], besides a broad Fe–O absorption
band below 800 cm−1 [15]. After heating at 773 K under nitro-
gen, for 2 h, the bands related to acetate and nitrate groups
disappeared and a band at 570 cm−1 assigned to magnetite [16]
appeared, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The chromia characteristic
bands [16] and the typical bands of chromates [17] were not
detected, in agreement with previous works [10,18].
In accordance with these results, the X-ray diffractograms
showed that during heating the solids produced magnetite
(JCPDF 88-0315) and no other phase was found, regardless the
preparation method and the presence of chromium, as shown
in Fig. 2(a). After WGSR, the X-ray patterns did not change

(Fig. 2(b)), indicating that the catalysts were stable during reac-
tion.
The TPR of pure iron oxide showed a curve with two small
reduction peaks between 543 and 673 K (Fig. 3), both attributed
to the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ species; they can be related
to the reduction of a maghemite layer produced on the solids
due to air exposition. A high temperature peak, in the range of
723–1043 K, is assigned to the reduction of Fe2+ to Fe0 species
[19]. The additional peak at 1138 K can be related to the reduc-
tion of the residual iron oxide in the center of the particles, which
was reduced at higher temperatures. It is well-known [20,21] that
thereductionofironoxideproceedsthroughasurface-controlled
process; once a thin layer of iron oxide with lower oxidation state
(wustite, metallic) is formed on the surface, it changes to dif-
fusional control. Therefore, this residual core does not easily
access the reducing gas and thus is reduced at higher temper-
ature where the diffusional process is faster. The addition of

chromium to magnetite did not affect its reduction proﬁle, but
shifted the peaks to high temperatures. It means that chromium
made the production of metallic iron more difﬁcult, suggesting
that it can delay this process during WGSR, in agreement with
previous works [22].
The results of the speciﬁc surface area measurements of
the solids are shown in Table 1. The chromium-doped samples
showed speciﬁc surface areas higher than magnetite, regardless
the preparation method, showing the role of chromium as tex-
tural promoter, in accordance with previous works [8,11]. In
addition, the impregnated sample showed higher speciﬁc sur-
face area than the precipitated one. After WGSR, the solids did
not show changes in the speciﬁc surface areas, indicating that
the solids were stable during reaction.
A typical Fe 2p core-level spectrum of the catalysts before
reaction is shown in Fig. 4(a). A similar proﬁle was obtained
with the spent catalysts. The Fe3+ and Fe2+ species can be
identiﬁed by two peaks at around 710.0 and 711.0 eV and a
satellite structure located at the high binding energy side [23].
Fig. 4(b) illustrates a typical Cr 2p core-level spectrum of the
catalysts before WGSR, which did not change during reaction.
The Cr3+ species were identiﬁed by a peak at around 576.0 eV
and a satellite structure located at the high binding energy side
[23].
In all cases, the amount of chromium on the surface was
higher than in the bulk, as noted by comparing the results of EDS
(bulk) and XPS (surface), shown in Table 2, in accordance with
previous works [8,24–26]. Therefore, the role of chromium in
delaying sintering can be assigned to its action as a spacer on the
surface, making the particles apart, as proposed by other authors
[8,24]. During the water gas shift reaction, some chromium had
migratedfromthesurfacebutitdidnotcauseasigniﬁcantchange
in speciﬁc surface areas. It suggests that chromium also plays
a role in the bulk, as noted previously for aluminum [27,28]
and chromium-doped iron oxide [29,30]. In fact, Edwards et al.
[29] showed that Cr3+ (d3) goes into the magnetite lattice and
occupies the octahedral sites because of its high crystal ﬁeld sta-

bilization, in contrast with the Fe3+ ion (d5) which does not have
any preferred site. In this case, chromium is supposed to cause
strains in the lattice, during the spinel formation, and then shifts
the equilibrium particle size towards smaller particles, since it
decreases the strain to the surface effects ratio.
It can also be noted that the impregnation method led to the
production of solids with higher amounts of chromium on the
surface, as compared to the precipitated one. This method also
led to a higher total amount of chromium in the solid, a fact
which can explain the higher speciﬁc surface area of the MCI
sample. This can be related to the lower rates of precipitation
of chromium compounds as compared to the iron ones. It is
well-known [31–36] that Fe3+ and Cr3+ ions undergo hydroly-
sis and polymerization in aqueous medium, as the pH increases.
Both ions exist as simple aquo-ions and form octahedral com-
plexes. As the Fe3+ cation (3d5) does not show any crystal
ﬁeld stabilization in octahedral symmetry, the rates of hydrol-
ysis and of polymerization are higher than those of the Cr3+
one (3d3) which exhibits a high crystal ﬁeld stabilization in
the same symmetry. Therefore, chromium cation is the least

hydrolyzed since it is the most crystal ﬁeld-stabilized one and
then the OH−species are supposed to produce a weaker ﬁeld
than water. As the olation reaction rates slow down as the crystal
ﬁeld stabilization increases, a decrease of the reactivity of the
chromium cation towards the ligand exchange is expected. In
agreement, the rate of dimerization of the [Fe(OH)(OH2)5]2+ ion
is k = 450 L mol−1 (25 ◦C) while the rate of dimerization of the
[Cr(OH)(OH2)5(C2O4)2]2+ isk = 10−5 L2 mol−2 s−1 [31].Inthe
present work, one can suppose therefore that in the preparation
conditions the iron compounds precipitated in a larger extension
than the chromium ones. On the other hand, during impregna-
tion (24 h) there was enough time for most of chromium to be
sorbed on the particles.
The Fe2+/Fe3+ molar ratios on the surface are also shown in
Table 2. It can be seen that chromium caused an increase of these
values and this effect was more pronounced for the impregnated
sample. After reaction, however, the opposite was noted and the
chromium-doped catalysts showed the lowest values. A large
decrease of the relative amounts of these species was noted after
reaction, in the case of chromium-doped catalysts.
The M¨
ossbauer spectrum of pure magnetite (Fig. 5(a)) was
ﬁtted with two sextets whose hyperﬁne parameters correspond to
Fe3+ in tetrahedral sites (A sites) and Fe“2.5+′′ in octahedral sites
(B sites) of Fe3O4 (Tables 4 and 5) [37]. The chromium addition
to magnetite (MCP and MCI samples) produced a decrease in
the hyperﬁne magnetic ﬁelds in both sites. This effect can be
attributed to the replacement of iron ions by chromium ones.

This decrease was more pronounced in B sites, indicating that
chromium ions entered preferentially into these sites. Notwith-
standing, within the experimental errors, the B/A population
ratio is the same for all fresh samples. Although it is well-known
that to estimate unambiguously the populations of A and B sites
it is necessary to do measurements at low temperatures [38], the
present results are adequate for comparative purposes. It was
also noted that the amount of Fe2+ and Fe3+ species depends
on the preparation method. For the spent MCP and M samples
(Fig. 5(b)) the B/A ratio has been increased about 20% as com-
pared to the fresh solids, while for the MCI sample this relation
remains constant.
It has been pointed out [39] that magnetite goes on slow oxi-
dation at low temperatures producing maghemite or hematite
depending on its preparation method. Therefore, the production
of an oxidized iron oxide on the magnetite particles is expected.
In the present work, this layer was detected by TPR on fresh cata-
lysts and probably was also present on the spent ones. Because of
this, the XPS and M¨
ossbauer experiments were used for com-
parison among samples exposed to the same conditions. The
Fe2+/Fe3+ surface ratio remains the same during reaction for the
M sample and thus the re-oxidation due to air exposition can be
considered the same for all samples; consequently, the decrease
of the Fe2+/Fe3+ surface ratio for the MCP and MCI samples dur-
ing reaction should not be attributed to air exposition and can
be related to chromium presence. In addition, M¨
ossbauer spec-
troscopy is less sensitive to the surface characteristics (except
when the crystallites are extremely small) than XPS and then
the agreements between these two techniques shows that the re-
oxidation of the samples due to air exposition can be considered
negligible for comparative purposes.
As expected, chromium increased the activity of the catalysts
as shown in Table 3. The preparation method strongly affected
the activity of the chromium-doped samples, which increased
in the order: MCP < MCI. In both cases, chromium caused an
increase in speciﬁc surface area, but a decrease in activity per
area. The decrease in the activity per area can be assigned to
the chromium ability in making the production of Fe2+ species
more difﬁcult, as shown by the M¨
ossabuer spectroscopy and
XPS results. This can decrease the activity of the catalytic sites,
by making the iron redox cycle more difﬁcult during WGSR.
It is largely accepted that the WGSR on iron-based catalysts
occurs by the regenerative mechanism, according to which the
surface undergoes successive oxidation and reduction cycles by
oxygen and water and carbon monoxide [8]. For the precipitated
sample, it resulted in a large decrease in the activity per area and
a catalyst with the same activity as magnetite was obtained, due
to the textural action of chromium. On the other hand, for the
impregnated catalyst, the decrease in the activity per area was
not enough to overcome the increased activity due to the higher
speciﬁc surface area and a more active catalyst was produced.
Fig. 6 shows the activity of the catalysts as a function of time. It

can be seen that all the samples were stable during the reaction
time.
4. Conclusions
The use of the precipitation and impregnation methods for
preparing chromium-doped magnetite leads to catalysts with
different textural and catalytic properties towards the water gas
shift reaction. However, chromium is able to preserve the spe-
ciﬁc surface areas during WGSR and to delay the metallic iron
production, regardless the preparation method.
Chromium also causes a decrease in activity per area, depend-
ing on the preparation method. This fact can be assigned to its
ability in making the production of Fe2+ species more difﬁcult
and then decreasing the activity of the catalytic sites, during
the redox cycle of the reaction. The most active catalyst can be
obtained by adding chromium by impregnation, which leads to
a large amount of total chromium in the solid and then a cata-
lyst with high speciﬁc surface area is produced. Chromium is
believed to act both in the bulk and on the surface preventing
sintering.
Moreover, it was conﬁrmed that it is possible to prepare the
catalysts in the active phase avoiding the reduction step.
