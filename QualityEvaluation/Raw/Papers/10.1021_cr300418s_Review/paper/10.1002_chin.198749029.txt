ChemInform Abstract has been performed by XRD, thermal gravimetry, temp.-programmed decomposition-MS, and temp.-programmed reduction-MS. After impregnation, the support consists of partially carbonated lanthanum hydroxide. Reduction at 623 K yields
Rh/LaO(OH). A reduction temp. of 723 K is necessary to obtain the Rh/La2O3 catalyst. In contrast to the dehydration of the support, the reduction of the carbonated phase is strongly activated by the presence of Rh.
