Oxygen vacancies on metal oxide surfaces have long been thought
to play a key role in the surface chemistry. Such processes have
been directly visualized in the case of the model photocatalyst sur-
face TiO2ð110Þ in reactions with water and molecular oxygen.
These vacancies have been assumed to be neutral in calculations
of the surface properties. However, by comparing experimental
and simulated scanning tunneling microscopy images and spectra,
we show that oxygen vacancies act as trapping centers and are ne-
gatively charged. We demonstrate that charging the defect signif-
icantly affects the reactivity by following the reaction of molecular
oxygen with surface hydroxyl formed by water dissociation at the
vacancies. Calculations with electronically charged hydroxyl favor a
condensation reaction forming water and surface oxygen adatoms,
in line with experimental observations. This contrasts with simula-
tions using neutral hydroxyl where hydrogen peroxide is found to
be the most stable product.

The rutile TiO2ð110Þ surface, which we use as a model photoca-
talytic system here, is displayed as a ball model in Fig. 1A. It is
characterized by alternate rows of fivefold coordinated Ti (Ti5c)
and bridging-O atoms (Ob) that run in the [001] direction. Fig. 1B
shows a typical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) image of
the surface. The Ti5c rows appear bright, and the Ob rows appear
dark. Point defects are common on this surface, the vast majority
being Ob vacancies (Ob-vac) and surface hydroxyls (OHb). As can
be seen in Fig. 1B, these defects appear as bright spots between
the bright Ti5c rows. Ob-vac are known to be particularly reactive,
with STM images providing compelling evidence that O2 dissoci-
ates at Ob-vac (1, 2) leaving a healed vacancy and one oxygen
adatom (Oad) on Ti5c according to ref. 3:
2Ti3þ þ Ob-vac þ O0
2ðgÞ →2Ti4þ þ O2−
b þ O0
ad
[1]
where the reduction of one oxygen atom of O2ðgÞ to one bridging
oxide species (O2−
b ) is accomplished by oxidation of the two Ti3þ
sites associated with Ob-vac to Ti4þ (3), on the basis of a purely
ionic model. (Formal charges are written in reactions 1 and 2 to
highlight the redox processes involved.)
The interaction of O2 with OHb, on the other hand, is still a
matter of controversy. Following the reaction of these species at
temperatures ≤240 K, water is seen to desorb at ∼310 K in tem-
perature programmed desorption (TPD) spectra (3, 4). Hender-
son et al. (3) concluded that this water evolution is a consequence
of the formation of oxygen adatoms (Oad) at the surface as
follows:
2Ti3þ þ 2OH1−
b þ O0
2ðgÞ →2Ti4þ þ H2O0ðgÞ þ 2O2−
b þ O0
ad
[2]
where the two Ti3þ species provide the two electrons necessary to
reduce one oxygen atom of O2ðgÞ to H2OðgÞ (3). In stark contrast
to the TPD results, previous calculations find H2O2 to be by far
the most stable product (5). Moreover, on the basis of these
calculations, water desorption is not expected up to the highest
temperature computed, 350 K (5). This discrepancy provided the
initial motivation for the present work.
Results and Discussion
We use STM to provide an additional experimental test of the
picture that has emerged thus far. Fig. 1B shows a surface con-
taining both Ob-vac and OHb, alongside the same surface in
Fig. 1C after it was exposed to 90 Langmuirs (L) O2 at 300 K
(1 L ¼ 1.33 × 10−6 mbar · s, 1 mbar ¼ 100 Pa). A number of
small, bright spots can be seen on the Ti5c sites (bright rows)
in the latter image. The histogram of the height distribution of
these bright spots, shown in Fig. 1D, indicates that these bright
spots are almost entirely due to one final product.
It should be noted that at lower O2 exposures we see a number
of different types of species on Ti5c rows that are likely to arise
from terminal hydroxyls (OHt) and other metastable species such
as O2H. These latter results are consistent with previous work
(4, 6).
Analysis of the images in Fig. 1 shows that before the reaction
with O2 there were about 72 OHb species and 38 Ob-vacs. Fol-
lowing the reaction with O2, about 118 new bright spots are seen
on the bright Ti5c rows in Fig. 1C. As it is well known that Oad
form after exposure of Ob-vac to O2 (1, 2, 7–9), we conclude that
Oad also forms from exposure of OHb to O2, in line with the
conclusions of Henderson et al. (3). Moreover, the availability
of only 72 H atoms rules out the possibility that the products
in the present case are OHt (4, 6).
There is, however, a subtle but crucial discrepancy between our
observations and the conclusions of Henderson et al. (3). With a
starting point of 38 Ob-vacs and 72 OHb, we would expect each
Ob-vac to yield one Oad (reaction 1) and each OHb to yield half an
Oad (reaction 2), i.e., only 74 Oad in total compared to the 118
found in the experiment. Because the availability of electrons
from reduced TiO2 is a prerequisite for O2ðgÞ dissociative adsorp-
tion on TiO2ð110Þ (3, 5), the extra Oad found in Fig. 1C require
the TiO2 sample to supply more electrons than expected on the
basis of the number of Ob-vac (2Ti3þ) and OHb (1Ti3þ) initially
present.
Thus, the assignment of the adsorbates in Fig. 1C to Oad and
the interpretation of TPD results (3) challenge the current

theoretical understanding of the surface chemistry of TiO2ð110Þ.
Even using a hybrid HSE06 approach (10, 11), which is expected
to describe more accurately than other functionals the electronic
structure of metal oxides, we also predict that H2O2 is over-
whelmingly the most stable product of the reaction between
O2 and OHb. This result, which is inconsistent with the TPD data,
mimics that found in previous simulations (5).
It turns out that we can only model Oad as the most stable
product when we allow excess electronic charge to accumulate
at the Ob-vac and OHb (see Fig. 2), the latter being formed by
reaction of water molecules with Ob-vac. The presence of extra
electrons at Ob-vac∕OHb originates from occupation of addi-
tional 3d electron states arising from polaronic distortion at both
Ob-vac and OHb sites. As we discuss later, the excess electronic
charge is not pinned directly at the Ob-vac but is rather found
localized at a number of reduced Ti sites around the vacancy
(see also Fig. S1). High affinities for both surface and bulk elec-
tron polaron trapping have been reported for substrates such as
HfO2 (13) and SiO2 (14). This has been used to explain a number
of surface properties, such as SiO2 discharge phenomena,
although not the surface chemistry.
Various spectroscopies suggest that Ob-vac introduces elec-
tronic states into the band gap about 1 eV below the conduction
band (CB) onset (3, 15, 16). These band gap states (BGS) are
known to have d character (15). The BGS persist even when
the Ob-vac are replaced with OHb formed by water dissociation
at the Ob-vac (3, 15). In our calculations, regardless of the numb-
er of electrons occupying the BGS [2 electrons (e) for Ob-vac(0),
3e for Ob-vacð1−Þ, 4e for Ob-vacð2−Þ, 1e for OHbð0Þ, 2e for
OHbð1−Þ, 3e for OHbð2−Þ] we find that the energy remains close
to 1 eV below the CB onset (Fig. 2A). The extra electrons, how-
ever, drastically affect the spatial distribution of the associated 3d
electronic density. While for Ob-vac(0), the simulations suggest a
subsurface localization immediately beneath the defect site (Tis
in Fig. 2B), the presence of one and two extra electrons induces
an electronic reorganization that moves electronic charge away
from the Ob-vac site and the corresponding Ob row (see Fig. 2D
and E). In line with other hybrid DFTresults for Ob-vac in high-k
dielectrics (13, 17), an analysis of the Ob-vac induced changes in
the global electronic distribution reveals symmetry breaking at
the defect site (details are shown in Fig. S2). This is discussed
in more detail below.
We now consider the possible origin of the additional electron-
ic charge. Given the ease of electron transfer in TiO2 (18, 19) with
reported barriers as low as 0.09 eV and mobilities as high as
5.24 × 10−2 cm2 V−2 s−1, it is reasonable to expect interstitial Ti
(Tiint)-donated electrons to diffuse comparatively freely within
the system (20). To test the hypothesis that they will, in this case,
diffuse toward the Ob-vac∕OHb sites at the surface, we also mod-
eled a much larger unit cell (8 trilayers) with inclusion of one
initially neutral Tiint atom. The increased size of the simulated
systems here (288 atoms for the clean slab) prevent us from
applying HSE06 so we chose instead to use a local spin density

approximation ðLSDAÞ þ U scheme already successfully applied
to Ob-vac on TiO2ð110Þ (21).
Fig. 3 shows the BGS spatial distribution for Ob-vac both
isolated and in the presence of one Tiint. Recently, Tiint species
have been suggested as the main origin of titania BGS (9) with
negligible importance of Ob-vac (or OHb) sites. In contrast, our
results shown in Fig. 3C and D demonstrate that a combination of
Tiint and Ob-vac induce new BGS. For isolated Ob-vac, the BGS
(and the associated Ti3þ sites) are symmetrically localized at or
immediately beneath the defect site (Fig. 3A). For one isolated
Tiint (Fig. 3B), the calculations suggest an asymmetric localisation
of the BGS at the Tiint site (one state) and on other separate,
regular lattice Ti sites across the slab. Following refs. 22 and
23, we assign the appearance of localized BGS, and the ensuing
local rehybridization to the chemical reduction of specific Ti sites
from their stoichiometric oxidation state (i.e., reduction from
Ti4þ to Ti3þ in an oversimplified ionic model).
Upon consideration of an Ob-vac together with one Tiint, cou-
pling between the vacancy site and the Tiint-donated electrons is
evidenced by the large changes in the BGS eigenvalues (Fig. 3D).
By comparing the formation energies of an isolated Ob-vac
(þ5.11 eV) and a Tiint-coupled vacancy (þ2.72 eV), the simula-
tions suggest a net stabilization of 2.39 eV for Ob-vac within the
adopted simulation cell. The concentration of Tiint modeled is
about an order of magnitude higher than experimental estimates
from the literature (20). This allows us to capture the qualitative
behavior but prevents us from addressing quantitatively the
number of electrons globally transferred to the surface. Given
that the Tiint concentration simulated is about an order of mag-
nitude greater than experimental estimates (20), this coupling
should be even more favorable in reality because the electrostatic
repulsion between BGS is expected to be much lower.
This BGS coupling drastically affects both the energy and, as
was the case for the HSE06 modeling for Ob-vacð2−Þ (Fig. 2), the
spatial distribution of the BGS of Ob-vac. The presence of Tiint-
donated BGS induces an electronic reorganization that moves
electronic charge away from the vacancy site and the correspond-
ing Ob row (Fig. 3C). Note that this is a different role for Tiint
than that claimed in an earlier study, where electronic states as-
sociated with Tiint were responsible for the BGS (9).
Analysis of the individual BGS for the coupled systems pro-
vides insight into how the Tiint-donated electrons couple to
Ob-vac sites. As shown in Fig. 3C–F, when Tiint-donated electrons
are modeled together with Ob-vac, hybridization between specific
BGS (circled in Fig. 3C, E, and F) make Tiint-donated electrons
available at the Ob-vac site thus locally charging Ob-vac with the
extra electrons necessary to account for the additional Oad
imaged in Fig. 1C. The same mechanism is also found for the
interaction of Tiint-donated electrons with OHb. In this case,
comparison
between
the

energies
of
OHb
(þ0.32 eV) and OHb∕Tiint (−1.05 eV) suggests a net stabilization
of 1.37 eV
. As with the Ob-vac∕Tiint system, the Tiint electronic
surplus is also characterized by symmetry breaking and hybridi-
zation between specific BGS (circled in Fig. S3).
Although we are unable to address directly the number of elec-
trons globally transferred to the surface, we can make estimates
based on the upper limit of reported Tiint concentration:
2 × 1019 cm−3, i.e., one per 800 TiO2 unit cells (20). In our esti-
mation, we assume typical Ob-vac∕OHb defect concentrations of
5 × 1013 cm−2 on a 1.0 × 0.5 × 0.1 cm3 sample, and we consider
that each Tiint generates four Ti3þ sites (Fig. 3B and ref. 24). This
means that to singly (doubly) charge Ob-vac∕OHb would only
require the participation of 0.0017% (0.0034%) of the global
number of Tiint-donated electrons.
T
o further validate our model of the electronic structure, we
probed the electronic charge distribution associated with Ob-
vac
experimentally
using
scanning
tunneling
spectroscopy
(STS) at ∼5 K. This low temperature was chosen to deliberately
freeze out polaronic hopping effects that are thought to average
out asymmetries that are predicted to arise at 0 K (17, 18, 25).
During the acquisition of the STM image shown in Fig. 4A,
the tip was immobilized at each point of the scan while tunneling
current versus bias voltage (I-V) spectra were recorded. This
method of recording I-V spectra alongside STM images is known
as current imaging tunneling spectroscopy (CITS) (16), and it
allows the I-V spectra to be displayed as current maps at each
voltage.
The STM image in Fig. 4A was acquired at a sample bias of
þ2 V with a tunneling current of 0.03 nA. It clearly shows both
OHb and Ob-vac as bright spots between bright Ti5c rows. The
current map at þ2 V has a similar appearance to the STM image,
as one would expect. However, the current map at −2 V (Fig. 4B)
has a very different appearance. Ob-vac and OHb both appear as
dark spots centered between two bright rows. Bright features can
be seen on the bright Ti5c rows and a correlation analysis (Fig. 4C)
shows that these lie diagonally adjacent to the Ob-vacs in the
positions of the second nearest Ti5c neighbors. Each Ob-vac tends
to be surrounded by one or two brighter features rather than four
equally bright features. Fig. 4D shows normalized conductance
spectra ðdI∕dVÞ × ðV∕IÞ that approximate the local density of
states. Each curve represents an average of 360 spectra corre-
sponding to the bright features, Ob-vac, OHb, Ti5c, and Ob. Simi-
lar spectra were recorded using the same tip with the tunneling
current set between 0.015 nA and 0.7 nA. We also recorded
some spectra using an iridium tip. In neither case did we observe
a shift of features, which suggests that the effect produced by

tip-induced band-bending is negligible. These STS data are in
broad agreement with recently reported 78 K results (27).
Fig. 5 shows our STM and current map simulations of Ob-vac
at þ2 V and −2 V, respectively. These are derived from the
HSE06 density of states. The simulations at þ2 V are similar
to each other, the highest current being found at the Ob-vac
(Fig. 5A, C, and E). In contrast, the simulations at −2 V are
strongly dependent on the Ob-vac charge. For both Ob-vac(0)
and Ob-vacð1−Þ, the highest current is found in a spot (or spots)
directly in line with the bridging O row, inconsistent with the ex-
perimental contrast. The experimental distribution of the defect
states is only reproduced in simulations of Ob-vacð2−Þ where the
highest current is found on a second nearest Ti5c neighbor with
little current along the Ob row. The current map for Ob-vacð2−Þ
at −2 V was deconstructed by separating the contributions into
“slices” with energy windows of 0.2 eV (Fig. S4). In this way, we
find that the asymmetry originates between energies of 1.1 and
1.5 eV
, with the majority signal between 1.1 and 1.3 eV
. This iden-
tifies the asymmetry in the current map with the BGS introduced
by Ob-vacð2−Þ. This asymmetry is not observed in data recorded
at 78 K (27). Presumably this arises because of significant polaro-
nic hopping of the type recently identified at room tempera-
ture (25).
STM and current map simulations based on the LSDA þ U
treatment of Tiint∕Ob-vac introduced above (Fig. 3C) also fit
the experimental results well. The asymmetry can again be traced
to the BGS of Ob-vac, in this case coupled to the Tiint donated
electrons (Fig. S5, S6).
We are now in a position to reexamine the theoretical descrip-
tion of the reactivity of O2 with Ob-vac and OHb in the presence
of Tiint-donated electron surplus. The use of the HSE06 (10, 11)
approach allows us to accurately describe the relative energies of
molecular H2OðgÞ, O2ðgÞ, H2ðgÞ. Consequently, the level of
accuracy of the calculated chemical potential and then the
grand-canonical formation energies are expected to be sufficiently
high to quantitatively address the thermodynamic stability of the
considered systems (SI Text, Table SI).
To match with our STM experiments, we use the results of our
calculations from a simulated temperature of 300 K, but we note
that the same trends are found at a large range of temperatures
around 300 K. The formation energies of the pertinent adsor-
bates (H2O2, H2O, O2H, OHt, and Oad) are shown in Fig. 6
alongside those for Ob-vac and OHb. We stress that owing to
the necessity of enforcing a compensating background in the
simulation cells, only relative energy differences for one specific
charge state can be meaningfully compared. T
o illustrate this
point, the energy of H2O2ð2−Þ can be compared with Oadð2−Þ
or O2Hð2−Þ but not with H2O2ð0Þ or Oadð0Þ.
The calculations indicate that when O2 reacts with Ob-vacð2−Þ
(ΔGf ¼ 0.41 eV), O2 dissociates, filling the vacancy and forming
one
Oadð2−Þ
(ΔGf ¼ −16.06 eV)
with
ΔG ¼ −16.47 eV
[Ob-vacð2−Þ þ ObðgÞ →Oadð2−Þ þ Ob], consistent with experi-
ments (1, 2). As for the reaction of O2 with OHb, we find that

whereas formation of O2Hð2−Þ from OHbð2−Þ is spontaneous
(OHbð2−Þ þ O2ðgÞ →O2Hð2−Þ þ Ob, ΔG ¼ −4.75 eV), the for-
mation of H2O2ð2−Þ (ΔGf ¼ −1.02 eV) is strongly unfavoured
with respect to Oadð2−Þ (ΔGf ¼ −16.06 eV). Thus the reaction
between O2 and OHb must take place via formation of
O2Hð2−Þ that, as with other OxHyð2−Þ intermediates, eventually
reacts to form Oadð2−Þ. O2 acts to scavenge all the initially avail-
able electron excess. Consistent with available spectroscopic data
(3, 9, 15) where exposure to O2 quenches the BGS, sample
oxidation in the calculation is accompanied by removal of Ti3þ
BGS and localisation of Oadð2−Þ states in the valence band,
VB (Fig. 6). Similar results are obtained by simulating one
Tiint in the presence of two Oad, as shown in Fig. S7. No BGS
are found associated with the Oad; instead the electronic charge
density contributes to the lattice VB. A Bader charge analysis
reveals a difference of 10% between the modeled atomic charges
of these Oad products (0.9e) and the bridging Ob atoms (1e), thus
highlighting the same oxide hybridization (22, 23) for both species
in the simulation cell.
Hence, by accounting for TiO2ð110Þ surface-trapped electron-
polarons, and the ensuing increase in the actual number of Ti3þ
species available at the surface, the experimentally observed for-
mation of Oad from the reaction of O2 with OHb can be correctly
described by theory. Furthermore, the same electron traps could
be involved in trapping photogenerated electrons with potential
implications for the photocatalytic activity of the surface. We
expect that electron trapping will be important in dictating the
reaction pathways on other dielectric metal oxide surfaces. This
will have important consequences in areas such as corrosion,
catalysis, and microelectronics.
Methods
Experimental. O2 reactions were performed at room temperature with a vari-
able temperature Omicron ultra high vacuum (UHV) STM. STS measurements
employed a liquid helium bath cryostat Omicron UHV STM in order to max-
imize stability. CITS were imaged with 100 × 100 pixels, the component I-V
spectra comprising 40 equally spaced points between þ2 and −2 V. Positive
bias indicates tunneling into empty sample states, with negative bias corre-
sponding to tunneling out of filled sample states. Tungsten tips were always
used unless otherwise stated. Standard sample preparation procedures were
employed that are described elsewhere (1).
Computational. Grand-canonical (μVT) formation energies (29) were calcu-
lated within a DFT-PAW approach implemented in the VASP program (30).
LSDA þ U simulations were carried out on the basis of 3 × 2 8 trilayers (8L)
slabs with a local Ueff ¼ 5.5 eV correction for Ti atoms, as suggested from
embedded cluster configuration interaction results (21). As for the smaller 3 ×
2 4 trilayer (4L) slabs, exchange and correlation terms were calculated at
PW91-GGA (31) level for geometrical relaxation and on a hybrid HSE06
(10, 11) basis for final single point calculations and STM simulations. Ti 3p
and 3s semicore states were treated as valence states. A 3 × 4 × 1 (Γ only) spe-
cial k-points grid, 15 Å vacuum range, and 400 eV plane-wave energy cutoff
were used for all the 4L (8L) simulations. The Γ-only finite sampling error on
BGS dispersion (8L) was found to be converged within 0.1 eV against the finer
3 × 4 × 1 grid. The two (six) topmost trilayers and the adsorbates were relaxed
to maximum atomic forces of 0.01 e Å−1. Spin polarization was enforced
accounting for the number of extra electrons and optimising for the highest
spin multiplicity.
As in previous investigations (28), STM and STS simulations were per-
formed with a Tersoff-Hamann approach (32) implemented in the bSKAN
program (33). The calculated HSE06 Fermi energy was used as the zero
voltage point.
Bader charge analysis (34) was carried out on the basis of the total charge
density i.e. accounting for both the electronic and ionic core charge.
