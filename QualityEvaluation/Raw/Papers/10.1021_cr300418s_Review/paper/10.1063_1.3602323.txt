Versatile Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relations are found from density functional theory for a
wide range of transition metal oxides including rutiles and perovskites. For oxides, the relation de-
pends on the type of oxide, the active site, and the dissociating molecule. The slope of the BEP
relation is strongly coupled to the adsorbate geometry in the transition state. If it is ﬁnal state-like the
dissociative chemisorption energy can be considered as a descriptor for the dissociation. If it is initial
state-like, on the other hand, the dissociative chemisorption energy is not suitable as descriptor for the
dissociation. Dissociation of molecules with strong intramolecular bonds belong to the former and
molecules with weak intramolecular bonds to the latter group. We show, for the prototype system
La-perovskites, that there is a “cyclic” behavior in the transition state characteristics upon
change of the active transition metal of the oxide. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

I. INTRODUCTION
Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relations1,2 have recently
been established quantitatively from density functional the-
ory (DFT) calculations. Linear relations between activation
energies and reaction energies or between transition state
energies and dissociative chemisorption energies have been
found for a number of surface reactions on different transition
metal surfaces3–11 and for a few transition metal compound
systems.12,13 Several reactions on transition metals are sug-
gested to follow a universal BEP relation, that is, they obey
a reactant independent but surface structure dependent linear
relation.4,6,10,14
In spite of considerable progress,15–22 theoretical under-
standing of the reactivity of transition metal oxides is less
established than that of pure transition metals. The aim of
this paper is to shed light on the reactivity of transition metal
oxides. We will probe the reactivity of these materials
by studying dissociation of small molecules on different
oxide surfaces. First, we will investigate if the dissociative
chemisorption energy can be used as a reactivity descriptor
by searching for a correlation between this energy and the
transition state energy, that is, if BEP relations exist for
these classes of materials. When it comes to the reactivity
of a surface, a more negative dissociative chemisorption
energy corresponds to a more reactive system. For catalytic

applications, the dissociative chemisorption energy should be
neither too high nor too low, that is, the products should nei-
ther bind too strongly nor too weakly to the surface. Second,
we will examine if a reactant independent BEP relation exists.
When combined with scaling relations23–25 the results of this
paper will provide tools to establish activity and selectivity
trends among oxide surfaces for heterogeneously catalyzed
reaction as is currently established for a number of transition
metal catalyzed reactions.26 The main conclusions in this
study are that BEP relations do exist for transition metal
oxide surface reactions, and that they are strongly dependent
on the bond properties of the dissociating molecules and the
reactivity of the surface.
In the following we will show results for a number of
different oxides. The oxides we have considered here can be
divided in two subgroups: binary MO2 oxides in the rutile
structure and ternary oxides ABO3 in the perovskite struc-
ture. In this study, the rutile surface under consideration is
the (110) surface (see Fig. 1), which is found to be most
stable.27 For perovskites, the (001) surface can be either AO-
or BO2- terminated. Here, the BO2-terminated perovskite sur-
face is considered due to its higher stability.28 Also, results on
pure metal surfaces are presented for comparison. The differ-
ent metal constituents in the oxides are M = Ti, Mo, Ru, Ir,
Pt, and A = Sr, La, and B = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co, Ni,
Cu. The chosen set of adsorbates is the homonuclear diatomic
molecules H2, N2, O2, Cl2, Br2, and I2, the heteronuclear di-
atomic molecules and radicals NO, CO, HCl, HBr, HI, and
OH, and the triatomic molecule H2O. Dissociation is studied

not only on different oxide surfaces but also at different active
sites for a given surface.
It should be noted, that while ordinary DFT calculations
within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) have
proven to give reliable and reasonably accurate results for
adsorption energies29,30 on transition metals, similar calcu-
lations for oxides are fewer and not as well tested. However,
there are several studies of oxides where a good agreement be-
tween DFT calculations and experiments exists.27,31 Possible
limitations and shortcomings of GGAs for oxides are a cur-
rent research topic.21,32–34 We caution that there may be cases
where the DFT-GGA approach employed here is not sufﬁ-
ciently accurate but these issues will not be considered here.
The present study is focusing on the variations in dissociation
and transition state energies between different systems, and
these will not be as sensitive to such accuracy issues as the
absolute energies.
II. CALCULATION DETAILS
All calculations are performed using the plane wave DFT
method as implemented in the DACAPO code.29,35 The sur-
faces are modeled using slabs consisting of four stoichiomet-
ric layers in a 2×2 unit cell geometry. Repeated slabs are
separated by a vacuum region of at least 15 Å (18 Å) for ru-
tiles (perovskites). During structure relaxation, the topmost
two layers are relaxed while the others are kept in the opti-
mized bulk positions. The Kohn-Sham equations are solved
using a basis set of plane waves with an energy (density) cut-
off of 350–400 eV (500 eV) and the Brillouin zone is sam-
pled with a 4×4×1 Monkhorst-Pack grid. To describe the
core electrons, the Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials36 are
used. The exchange and correlation interactions are modeled
with the RPBE functional29 and the dipole correction is in-
cluded according to the scheme in Ref. 37.

(Ediss = Ediss −Esurf −Emol,
ETS = ETS −Esurf −Emol, where Ediss is the energy of
the adsorbed dissociated molecule, ETS is the energy of the
adsorbed molecule in the transition state, Esurf is the energy
of the clean surfaces, and Emol is the energy of the molecule).
The O2 energy is calculated from H2O and H238 to avoid the
well-known DFT error in the O2 energy.39 The transition state
is determined by applying a ﬁxed-bond length method, in
which the energy at various bond lengths of the molecule are
calculated while the remaining degrees of freedom of the sys-
tem are completely relaxed. We note that for systems where
the dissociation of the reactant occurs without an energy
barrier the relations between ETS and Ediss become unde-
ﬁned. To present the data for these systems we have chosen
ETS as the highest energy point along the reaction pathway.
The adsorbate coverage in all systems is 1/4 ML relative
to the number of metal atoms in the surface layer. In addition,
the inﬂuence of the adsorbate–adsorbate interaction on the
BEP relations is investigated by performing calculations of
N2 and NO on RuO2 and PtO2 in a 2×3 unit cell geometry
corresponding to a 1/6 ML coverage. The results show that
the BEP relations are not signiﬁcantly affected by coverage
effects. The absolute Ediss and ETS energies are seen to
change slightly, but with the same amount, hence preserving
the BEP relation.
To test the accuracy of our approach we have compared
the BEP relations obtained using RPBE with other GGA
methods (PW91 and PBE). The dissociation of O2 on TiO2,
RuO2, and IrO2 have been studied and we ﬁnd that the rela-
tions are identical in terms of the slopes whereas the inter-
cepts are slightly different for the three GGA’s PBE having
the largest intercept and RPBE having the smallest. We ﬁnd
that the Ediss and ETS values shift by approximately the
same energy amount upon change of GGA.
To justify that the stationary points on our potential
energy surface obtained using a grid procedure indeed
represent transition state geometries we have performed a
vibrational analysis of O2 on TiO2, RuO2, and IrO2. In each
case we ﬁnd a single imaginary frequency hence identifying
the geometry as a ﬁrst order saddle-point.
In general, we do not expect large differences between
zero-point energies on transition state geometries and ﬁnal
state (FS) geometries. To substantiate this assumption we
have calculated the zero-point energies for O2 on TiO2, RuO2,
and IrO2. Indeed the zero-point energies in the TS and the FS
differ by less than 0.02 eV hence, in the following we will
disregard this.
The effect of spin has been tested also for the O2 dissoci-
ation on TiO2, RuO2, and IrO2. When spin is included in the
calculations it reduces to zero except in the case where the
transition state is weakly bonded to the oxide (TiO2). In this
case the transition state is already maximally ﬁnal state-like
and hence per deﬁnition on the dissociation line.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The general conclusion is that there exists a characteris-
tic correlation between ETS and Ediss for each molecule
on a given dissociation site of an oxide or a metal. It is, how-
ever, not given a priori that one should be able to describe this
correlation by a single linear relation given by
ETS = αEdiss + β.

From now on we will refer to a relation of this type as
the averaged BEP relation. A ﬁne-structure analysis of the

correlation shows that it, at least to a ﬁrst order approxima-
tion, can be viewed as a collection of piecewise linear BEP
relations.
We also ﬁnd that each molecule follows its own BEP
relation. This directly implies that the “universal” BEP rela-
tion only is valid as a very crude zeroth order approximation.
However, for certain molecules and surfaces in a narrow
energy region, the individual BEP relations are similar. It is
only under such circumstances that a universal BEP relation
is observed.
The averaged piecewise linear BEP relations are shown
in Figs. 2, 3, and 6 while the linear ﬁts for individual
molecules are given in Table I. To simplify the discussion we
divide the BEP relations in the following classes: (I) a sin-
gle BEP line or (II) a collection of piecewise linear BEP lines
(see Fig. 2). The latter can in turn be divided into two sub-
classes, deﬁned by whether the BEP relation is a single- or
multi-valued function of Ediss, denoted as IIa) and IIb), re-
spectively. In the following, the versatile nature of these cor-
relations is discussed for different materials individually and
then compared with each other.
A. Rutiles
For rutiles, the calculations reveal (see Fig. 2) unique
BEP lines for each of the considered dissociation sites:
cus–cus, br–br, br–cus, Ocus–cus, Obr–cus, Ocus–Ocus, and
Obr–Obr. The notation of the dissociation site follows the
geometry of the ﬁnal state, see Fig. 1. For example, Ocus–cus
denotes that one of the two molecule fragments is adsorbed
on a Ocus site and the other one on a cus site.
Class I: We ﬁnd that the br–br site, br–cus site, and the
Ocus–Ocus site (see the respective subﬁgures in Fig. 2) belong
to class I with a simple averaged BEP relation consisting of
only one line. The slopes of the BEP lines depend on the ac-
tive site (αbr–br = 0.75, αbr–cus = 0.84, and αOcus–Ocus = 0.14).
The adsorbate geometry in the TS differs between the ac-
tive sites. For the br–cus site, the bond length between the
two molecular fragments in the TS is considerably elongated,
which means that the adsorbed molecule has lost its molecu-
lar identity, and the TS geometry resembles the geometry of
the FS. The TS geometry has more FS character the closer the
point is to the dissociation line, deﬁned by ETS = Ediss.
For the Ocus–Ocus site, the bond length in the TS is close
to the bond length of the free molecule. The TS geometry
in the br–br site is less FS-like than the one of the br–cus
site, and therefore αbr–br < αbr–cus. Hence, having a FS-like
TS geometry results in a BEP line with a slope close to unity.
The more initial state (IS)- like the TS geometry is, the larger
the deviation from the dissociation line is leading to α ≪1.
This in turn indicates that ETS is very weakly dependent on
Ediss, if at all.
Class IIa: The BEP relation for dissociation of H2 on the
Obr–Obr site can be classiﬁed as IIa (see the Obr–Obr subﬁg-
ure in Fig. 2). One part of the BEP relation coincides with
the dissociation line while the other part coincides with the
association line, which corresponds to ETS = 0. For the ox-
ides on the dissociation (association) line the TS geometry is
FS-like (IS-like). This illustrates that Ediss is not a suitable
descriptor.
Class IIb: The cus–cus and the Obr–cus sites (see the re-
spective subﬁgure in Fig. 2) belong to class IIb. The averaged
BEP relation consists of two parts, with slopes that coincide
either with the slope of the dissociation line or with the slope
of the association line. For a given Ediss value, the resulting
ETS can fall on either the association or the dissociation line.
This implies that different molecules follow signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent BEP lines. For the molecules on the averaged BEP line
with α ∼0, ETS is independent of the Ediss. This supports
the ﬁnding of case IIa, that Ediss is not a good descriptor
for dissociation. From the geometrical investigation, we again
ﬁnd that the slope of the BEP line depends on whether the ad-
sorbates TS geometry is FS-like, resulting in an α-value close
to unity, or if it is IS-like, resulting in an α-value close to zero.
From the above analysis, the molecules can be divided
into two groups: molecules with quite strong or very strong
intramolecular bonds, for example, N2, and very reactive
molecules, for example, the diatomic homogeneous halide
based molecules or diatomic heteronuclear weakly bond
molecules containing halide atoms. In conclusion, the BEP
relation is strongly dependent on the dissociating molecule.
For the dissociation of H2O into OH and H over the
Ocus–cus site (see the Ocus–cus subﬁgure in Fig. 2), when
ﬁtting the points to a straight line we ﬁnd a BEP slope that
is larger than one. Since α > 1 is unphysical it is likely that
the barrier for H2O dissociation is overestimated on TiO2 and
that all transition state energies exactly follow the ﬁnal state
behavior, note the small energy scale on the y-axis.
We ﬁnd that many molecules prefer to dissociate over the
symmetric cus–cus site on a stoichiometric non-reduced MO2
surface. This is presumably because of the completion of
the octahedral geometry of the under-coordinated metal sur-
face atoms on the clean surface. Nevertheless, the heteronu-
clear diatomic molecules that contain H prefer the asymmetric
Obr–cus site, where the H recombines with O.
Comparing sites where only surface metal atoms are in-
volved in the dissociation, i.e., the cus–cus, br–br, br–cus
site, one ﬁnds that for a given adsorbate, the magnitude of
the slopes of the BEP relations can be ordered as αbr–br
< αbr–cus < αcus–cus. This illustrates that the BEP slope de-
pends on the active site and that the α-values can be extrap-
olated. On a bridge site each adsorbate atom interacts with
two fourfold coordinated surface metal atoms, while on the
cus site each adsorbate atom interacts only with one ﬁvefold
surface metal atom. Hence, the bridge site, which resembles a
vacancy site, is highly under-coordinated and, therefore, sub-
stantially more reactive than the cus site. The BEP slope is
smallest for br–br since the surface atoms are more reactive
and the intramolecular bonds will break more easily, resulting
in a TS geometry that is less FS-like. Hence, the dissociation
is favorable on a reduced surface where the br-sites are free to
take part in the reaction.
For some molecules, e.g., N2 on metal surfaces it has
been shown that there is a geometric effect inﬂuencing the
form of the BEP relation.6,40 One could talk about such an
effect for the br–br site, which has a signiﬁcantly different
geometry than the rest of the considered active sites. Another

site where the BEP line experiences a rigid shift away from
the dissociation line is the Obr–cus site. This should be com-
pared with the cus–cus site. Dissociation over these two active
sites involves the same amount of surface atoms, however,
these surface atoms have different coordination and consist of
different atomic species. Hence, there is no straightforward
one-to-one correspondence between the geometry of the ac-
tive site and the α-value for the oxides.
In conclusion, the BEP relations for rutiles show a deli-
cate interplay between the type of molecule and the electronic
structure of the active site in the conformation of the TS.
B. Perovskites
Figure 3 shows the results for the (100) surfaces of
La- and Sr-perovskites. Also for this group of oxides BEP
relations exist with an averaged relation given by ETS
= 0.79Ediss + 1.42 eV on a zoomed out level. However, the
individual relations for each adsorbate and perovskite group
(see Table I) show that different adsorbates obey their own
BEP relations. In other words, the universal relation for per-
ovskites is insufﬁcient to describe the ﬁne-structure behavior
of the dissociation barriers.
The considered adsorption site on perovskites is atop of
the surface B atoms, which leads to a locally fully coordinated
structure around the surface B atom (see inset in Fig. 3). For
the perovskites adopting or being very close to the ideal cubic
symmetry, the relaxed adsorbate geometry is where the two
atoms in the adsorbed molecule are positioned symmetrically
atop of the B surface atoms. Otherwise, the adsorbate geome-
try gets skewed due to tilting of the octahedral framework.
When it comes to the transition state geometries, the per-
ovskites on or in the close proximity of the dissociation line
have FS-like geometries. In Sec. III C, the character of the TS
will be discussed in more detail.
C. Transition state character: La-perovskites
To study the variations in character of the TS, we here
consider dissociation of N2, NO, and O2 on LaBO3 per-
ovskites with different B metal atoms belonging to the 3d

Fig. 4) approaches the dissociation line for high Ediss values
and deviates from the dissociation line as the Ediss becomes
more negative. The α-values change as 0.86, 0.80, and 0.58
for N2, NO, and O2, respectively.
Second, if the reactivity of an oxide would depend solely
on the position of the B metal atom constituent in the peri-
odic table, the reactivity trend should be monotonous along a
period. The situation is, however, more complicated, for ex-
ample, the reactivity of the LaBO3 perovskites for N2 dissoci-
ation is LaScO3 < LaCuO3 < LaNiO3 < LaCoO3 < LaFeO3
< LaTiO3 < LaMnO3 < LaVO3 < LaCrO3.
In Fig. 5, the calculated potential energy along the disso-
ciation path is given for each adsorbate. For a given molecule,
the character of the TS changes upon change of the substrate,
in other words as the B constituent of ABO3 changes. The
TS character can be either IS-like, FS-like, or somewhere in-
between. For N2, the TS is FS-like on LaCuO3, and it be-
comes less FS-like and more IS-like as the B metal is changed
from Ni to Cr. The TS character has most IS-character when
N2 is dissociated on LaCuO3. As the B metal is changed from
V to Sc the TS character changes and becomes more FS-like.
Similar results are found for NO and O2, with the difference
that the turning points are found for different B metals in the
perovskites.
The conclusion is that when moving in the 3d series from
Cu to Sc, the TS goes through a “cycle” from being FS-like
(like B = Cu), where the points fall on the dissociation line,
to IS-like (like B = Fe), and becoming FS-like (like B = Sc),
falling back on the dissociation line. Compounds with the
most IS-like character are located to the left of the BEP lines
and, therefore, deviate the most from the dissociation line.
There is no reason not to believe that this “cyclic” behavior
should be valid for substrates with B metals with other group
numbers outside the studied range. It is also this cyclic
behavior that is responsible for non monotonous reactivity
order of the La-perovskites.

relations for the lowest TS barriers can be characterized
as class I, with the averaged relations given by ETS
= 0.81Ediss + 1.56
eV
and
ETS = 0.75Ediss + 2.06
eV for the (211) and (111) surfaces, respectively. They
are in agreement with the relations from Ref. 6, ETS
= 0.87Ediss + 1.34 eV and ETS = 0.90Ediss + 2.07 eV,
for the (211) and (111) surfaces, respectively. The difference
in the relations found in the current study and the one in
Ref. 6 is assigned to the somewhat different composition of
the calculated data points on which the linear regressions
are made. In the current study, metal surfaces in a broader
reactivity range are included. Including more reactive metals,
that is more negative Ediss, results in a larger deviation from
the dissociation line. The individual ﬁts for each adsorbate on
these surfaces are given in Table I. It is found that O2 has an
α-value that is substantially different from the averaged BEP
α-value. This implies that there is a signiﬁcant ﬁne structure
in the BEP relation for both transition metals as well as for
oxides.
E. Oxides vs metals
When comparing the BEP relations associated with the
lowest TS for metals and oxides, we ﬁnd (considering the N2,
O2, and NO molecules) that both groups of oxides obey re-
lations that are closer to the dissociation line than the (111)
and (211) metal surfaces. The rutiles have very low (if any)
barriers with respect to the gas phase, while the perovskites
exhibit more pronounced barriers. The averaged α-value for
the perovskites is in-between the α-value of the (111) and the
(211) surfaces, whereas the averaged β-value is closer to the
β-value of the (211) surfaces. Hence, there is a major differ-
ence between the two types of oxides. The fact that molecules
with strong or moderate intramolecular bonds dissociate with-
out any substantial barriers on rutiles, make these oxides ex-
tremely interesting as catalysts for dissociation of diatomic
molecules compared to the metals. In the energy region most
relevant for catalysis, i.e., where Ediss ∼0 eV, we ﬁnd ru-
tiles as RuO2 and IrO2.

IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
In summary, density functional theory calculations show
that BEP relations also exist for oxides and that they have
a richly detailed structure. Among the molecules and oxides
investigated in this study, one ﬁnds the whole spectrum of
BEP relations with slopes from one to almost zero. A slope
equal to zero corresponds to a system with no activation bar-
rier and hence the ETS by deﬁnition is not a well deﬁned
quantity. Surprisingly, we have found that the BEP relations
for molecules with strong intramolecular bonds on the most
stable site on rutiles follow a relation that almost coincides
with the dissociation line. This suggests that these oxides
are interesting as alternative catalysts for reactions involving
the dissociation of diatomic molecules compared to transition
metals. The perovskites could also be interesting for some re-
actions, since with respect to their dissociative abilities they
intrinsically resemble the steps on transition metals.
Our results show that if the underlying nature of bond-
ing in the TS and the dissociated state are similar, that is the
TS is FS-like, these are correlated via a BEP relation with a
slope close to unity. This is the case for molecules with strong
intramolecular bonds. On the other hand, if the TS is more
IS-like the BEP relations become FS-independent and the dis-
sociative chemisorption energy becomes an invalid descriptor
for the dissociation barrier. This is the case for very reactive
surfaces or molecules with weak intramolecular bonds. We
have identiﬁed a “cyclic” behavior in the TS character, that is
it can change from being FS to IS and back to FS as the metal
constituent of the oxide is varied through a period in the peri-
odic table. This implies that on a detailed level the concept of
universal BEP relation is an insufﬁcient model unable to take
into account the ﬁne-structure observed in this study.
It is also found that, for a given molecule and active site,
the BEP relation is a continuous function that depends on
the strength of the bond formed between the surface and the
molecule. At the moment we do not have a completely pre-
dictive approach of what the form of the BEP relation should
look like, but we know that it to a good approximation can be
viewed as a piecewise linear relation. This will be the subject
of future studies.
The combined knowledge of BEP relations and scaling
relations opens up the possibility to evaluate the activity of
oxides in terms of simpliﬁed descriptors. Hence, extending
the fundamental knowledge of the reaction chemistry at the
atomic level may widen our perspectives of oxides as future
heterogeneous catalysts.
