A correlation-energy
formula
due to Colle and Salvetti [Theor. Chim. Acta 3'7, 329 (1975)], in
which the correlation
energy
density
is expressed
in terms of the electron density
and a Laplacian
of the second-order
Hartree-Fock
density
matrix,
is restated
as a formula
involving
the density
and local kinetic-energy
density.
On insertion
of gradient
expansions
for the 1ocal kinetic-energy
density,
density-functional
formulas
for the correlation
energy
and correlation
potential
are then
obtained.
Through
numerical
calculations
on a number of atoms, positive ions, and molecules, of
both open- and closed-shell
type, it is demonstrated
that these formulas,
like the original
Colle-
Salvetti formulas,
give correlation
energies within a few percent.
I. INTRODUCTION
Interest
in calculation
of the correlation
energy
continues
unabated. '
%e here report
a new
development,
in
which
the Colle-Salvetti
formula
for calculating
correlation
energy
from the Hartree-Fock
second-order
density
ma-
trix
is converted
into a density-functional
formula.
Let p(r) be the Hartree-Fock
electron density
and p2 "(r,,r2) be the diagonal
element of the second-order
Hartree-
Fock reduced density matrix,

p2" can also be expressed
in terms of interparticle
coordinates,
p2 "(r,s), where
ri+r2

The Colle-Salvetti
formula
for correlation
energy then is

where a =0.049 18„b=0.132, c =0.2533, and d =0.349.
This formula
was arrived
at by Colle and Salvetti
by a
theoretical
analysis
accompanied
by a series of approxi-
mations,
beginning
(essentially)
from the reasonable
pro-
position
that the second-order
density
matrix
including
correlation
may
approximated
by
the
Hartree-Pock
second-order
density
matrix
times a correlation
factor.
The constants a, b, c, and d in the final formula
were ob-
tained
by a f][tting procedure
using
only
the Hartree-
Fock orbital
for the
hehum
atom.
Colle and
Salvetti
demonstrated
that Eq. (3) gave good predicted
correla-
tion energies
for atoms
and molecules.
They also pro-
vided
and tested a generalized
form for open-shell
sys-
tems.
Here we carry on the analysis of Eq. (3) itself.
II. FORMULAS INVOLVING LOCAL

having
an even number of electrons.

Results
of calculations
with
this
formula
are given
in
Table I.
For
atoms,
Clementi
wave
functions
were
used;
for
molecules,
wave
functions
of Snyder
and
Basch.
These are in complete
agreement
with
the re-
sults of Colle and Salvetti,
as they
should
be since Eq.
(10) follows directly from Eq. (3).
Consider
next a system
in a state described
by a gen-
eral
single
determinant,
in
which
the
a-spin
electron
density
difFers from the P-spin electron
density.
(In the
open-shell
restricted
Hartree-Fock
case, which
here
is
our primary
concern, the a-spin orbitals are the same as
the P-spin orbitals
in the closed-shell
part, but an excess
of lx- or p-spin
orbitals
in the rest. )
Equation

placed by

III. GRADIENT EXPANSION FGRMUI.AS
Equations
(10) and
(15) lack of being
pure
density
functionals
only because of the appearance
in them of
the Hartree-Pock
local kinetic-energy
densities
tHF, tHF,
and t HF, which depend on individual
orbital densities.
If
the view is adopted
that the orbitals are the Kohn-Sham
orbitals,
then these quantities
too are functionals
of the
density,
and
Eqs.
(10)
and
(15) are
pure
density-
functional
expressions
[as would
be Eq. (3) with this in-
terpretation].
Eschewing
that
view for the present„one
can
turn
Eqs.
(10) and
(15) into
explicit
density-
tT„(r)=C~P(r)'i,
C~= —,
', (3n
) i
(16)
In terms of this, the conventional
closed-shell
gradient
expansion of tHF gives,
to zero order,
to second order,
tHF(r)=tTF(r)+[ —,
'tg (r)+ —,
', V' p],
l
functional
formulas
by using gradient
expansions„where-
by
t HF
is
expanded
about
the
Thomas-Fermi
local
kinetic-energy
density
tTF.
The Thomas-Fermi
kinetic-energy
density
is given by
DEVELOPMENT OF THE COLLE-SALVETTI CORRELATION-. . .
and
so on.
An alternative
formula
is provided
by the
mean-path
approximation,
to zero order,
tH„(r)=tTF(r)+[ ,
'tn
—(r)
——
,', V' p] .
For the open-shell
case, the corresponding
formulas
are
readily derived using"
t „(r)=-,
't „(2p (r),r),
t~H„(r)= —,
'tH„(2ptt{r), r) .
The correlation
energy
formulas
of Eqs. (10) and
(15)
then become

As written,
these are conventional
second-order
gradient
expansion
formulas,
for closed and open shells, respectively.
The zero-order
formulas
are obtained
by striking
out the terms
within
the parentheses
in each case. The zero-order
mean-path
formula
is obtained
by replacing
—,
', with —
—,
', in these terms.
Table I gives numerical
results obtained
from these formulas.
The second-order
gradient
formulas
are hardly
distin-
guishable
from the original Eqs. (10) and (15) and provide excellent representations
of actual correlation
energies.
The
conventional
zero-order
gradient
formula
and the zero-order
mean-path
formula
are not quite as good.
