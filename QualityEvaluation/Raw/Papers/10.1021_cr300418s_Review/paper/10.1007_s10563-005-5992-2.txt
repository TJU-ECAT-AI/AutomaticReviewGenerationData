An innovative intelligent catalyst that exhibits a greatly improved durability as a result of the self-regenerative function of Pd
nanoparticles has been developed. Self-regeneration was realized through a cycle between solid solution and segregation of Pd in a
perovskite crystal, without any auxiliary treatment. That is, Pd atoms move back and forth between the inside (as Pd cations in the
lattice) and the outside (as Pd nanoparticles) of the perovskite crystal in synchronization with the ﬂuctuations between reductive
and oxidative (redox) atmospheres that occur in real automotive exhaust gases. As a result of this cyclic redox reaction, the growth
of Pd nanoparticles can be suppressed during the entire lifetime of the vehicle. This self-regenerative function provides a new and
useful tool for the development of future automotive catalysts. The mechanism of the self-regenerative function is described, and it
is shown by ex situ and in situ X-ray absorption ﬁne-structure spectroscopic analyses that the self-regenerative function occurs at an
extremely high speed over a wide range of temperatures. In addition, technical solutions for overcoming the weaknesses of general
perovskite catalysts for practical use are described.
1. Introduction
A catalyst that does not age has been a long-held
dream of automotive engineers. In this article, the
outline of an intelligent catalyst is described [1–5]. This
catalyst has the ability to regain its catalytic activity,
should this deteriorate, without any outside interference.
From the viewpoint of intelligent materials [6], the
intelligence of the catalyst may be deﬁned as its ability to
maintain a high performance by adapting its structure,
responding sensitively to environmental changes.
The important role of the automotive three-way cata-
lyst is widely recognized for the simultaneous conversion
of emissions of three pollutants in engine exhaust gases:
carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and un-
burned hydrocarbons (HC). The conventional three-way
catalyst consists of ﬁne particles of precious metals dis-
persed on ceramic support materials such as alumina, ce-
ria, or zirconia; however, the catalytic activity of such
catalysts deteriorates, owing to the agglomeration and
growth of precious-metal particles during use. It is essen-
tial to suppress the growth of precious metal particles to
achieve a high eﬃciency and to conserve precious metals.
An intelligent Pd–perovskite catalyst has been devel-
oped that has a greatly improved durability as a result of
the self-regeneration function of Pd nano-particles. It has
been conﬁrmed that the catalytic activity can be main-
tained even when the amount of precious metals is
reduced by 70–90%. A vehicle equipped with the intel-
ligent catalyst was supplied to the market and succeeded
in achieving the ultra-low-emission vehicle (ULEV)
standard in 2002. Moreover, the intelligent catalyst has
also succeeded in achieving a new super-ultra-low-emis-
sion vehicle (SULEV) standard, adopted from January
2004. The production of clean vehicles equipped with the
intelligent catalyst exceeded one million units in January
2005. By this technology, it not only became possible to
achieve a drastic reduction in the cost of catalysts, but
also the technology solved the problem of the supply and
demand of precious metals for automotive applications,
which had caused a negative eﬀect on other industries.
The
intelligent
catalyst
now
attracts
worldwide
attention and provides a new concept for the develop-
ment
of
future
automotive
catalysts.
Here,
the
background to the development of the catalyst, technical
details of the intelligent catalyst in the study phase,
problems in practical application and their solutions,
and future prospects are described.
2. Background
2.1. Purpose of the study
Automotive emissions regulations are getting tighter
and tighter all over the world. The Japanese government
has introduced cleaner emission standards, designated
ULEV and SULEV, which involve, respectively, 50%
and 75% reductions in emissions of both HC and NOx
in comparison with the emission regulation in force in
2005. The Japanese government oﬀers a tax incentive in
respect of ULEV and SULEV vehicles and is promoting
the introduction of such clean vehicles to the market.

More and more precious metals must be used to meet
these
severe
standards
when
conventional
catalyst
technologies are applied. In particular, the demand for
Pd for use in automotive catalysts has mushroomed
from 15 tonnes per year to over 150 tonnes per year
over the last decade (ﬁgure 1) [7]. This drastic increase is
a result of the strengthening of cold-emission regulations
world wide, which has made development of technolo-
gies to reduce the use of precious metals so urgent. The
intelligent catalyst has been developed as a solution to
reduce the use of precious metals, especially Pd.
2.2. History of research on perovskite catalysts
A perovskite-type oxide has an ABO3-type crystal
structure, in which cations with a large ionic radius have
a twelve-fold coordination to oxygen atoms and occupy
the A-sites, and cations with a smaller ionic radius have
a six-fold coordination and occupy the B-sites. A and O
form a cubic close packing, and B is contained in the
octahedral voids within the packing. If the ionic radii
are rA, rB, and rO, for a perovskite crystal structure to be
formed,
the
tolerance
factor
(t) = (rA + rO)/
2(rB + rO) must lie within the range 0.8 < t < 1.0,
and
rA > 0.090 nm,
and
rB > 0.051 nm.
A
large
number
of
elements
can
form
ideal
or
modiﬁed
perovskites, depending on the tolerance factor.
Perovskites are interesting materials for catalytic
applications and for fundamental studies of catalysis.
Many studies on the catalytic properties of perovskite-
type mixed oxides have been reported [8–28]. The
characteristics of perovskite catalysts are summarized as
follows [29,30].
(1) In LnMO3 (Ln
= lanthanide,
M = transition
metal) perovskites, the catalytic activity for oxida-
tion is mainly determined by the B-site elements and
follows the order Co > Mn > Ni
> Fe > Cr
[23].
(2) In LnMO3 perovskites, the structural stability in a
reductive atmosphere is also determined by the
B-site elements, in the order Cr > Fe > Mn > -
Co > Ni [17].
(3) One of the advantages of the formation of a
perovskite structure is the increase in the thermal
stability of the transition metal oxide [13].
(4) Another advantage is the ability to control valencies
and vacancies to enhance the catalytic activity
[10,12,15,19].
(5) Addition of precious metals to perovskites improves
the activity of three-way catalysts for NOx reduction
[26–28].
(6) A new function of Pd–perovskite has been devel-
oped to regenerate precious metals through the cycle
of solid solution and segregation in a perovskite
crystal under the conditions of use, without any
auxiliary treatment [1–5].
2.3. Issues relating to the industrialization of perovskite
catalysts
In order to industrialize the perovskite catalyst as an
intelligent catalyst for automotive applications, the
following issues remain:
Issue A: The perovskite catalysts investigated in our
previous studies contain cobalt (Co), which has been
identiﬁed in the German clean air regulations TA-luft as
a potential carcinogen.
Issue B: The most important issue is the proof of the
operation of this new self-regenerative function in the
ambience of an actual automotive exhaust gas.
Issue C: In order to put the catalyst into practical use,
it is necessary to overcome the problem of a low surface
area, which is a weak point of the perovskite [20,21]. It is
also required to improve the chemical stability against
sulfur poisoning.
In this article, the self-regenerative function of Pd in a
LaFeCoPdO3 perovskite is elucidated, and the eﬀect of
this function on the catalytic activity of the perovskite is
demonstrated. Next, as a solution of issue A, it is shown
that a perovskite catalyst with a new Co-free LaFePdO3
composition
has
a
self-regenerative
function.
The
temperature dependency and response of the self-
regenerative function of the LaFePdO3 perovskite were
studied in relation to issue B.
Moreover, a composite material technique, which
enhances the surface area by forming and dispersing ﬁne
perovskite particles on support materials, has been
developed to answer issue C. The design of a catalyst for
practical use of perovskite composite materials is
explained, and the results of an examination of the
resistance of the catalyst to poisoning by sulfur are
described. The details of experiment techniques and
procedures have been explained in previous papers,
shown as references.
3. Elucidation of the self-regenerative function
A palladium-containing perovskite (Pd–perovskite;
LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3) powder catalyst was prepared
Figure 1. Demands for precious metals.

by the alkoxide method [1,3]. The monolithic catalysts,
LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3 and Pd/Al2O3, were aged at
900 C (catalyst inlet temperature) for 100 h in exhaust
gas from a real 4000-cm3 V-8 engine [1]. Figure 2 com-
pares the CO–NOx crossover point conversion of these
catalysts [1]. The Pd–perovskite catalyst maintained its
high activity during aging, whereas the activity of the
Pd/alumina
catalyst
deteriorated
by
about
10%.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the
aged catalysts are shown in ﬁgure 3 [1,32]. The magni-
ﬁcation is 400,000 times and the white bar measures
20 nm. The Pd particles on alumina reached sizes of up
to 120 nm, whereas only small metallic particles of
about 1–3 nm in diameter were found on the perovskite
surface. The remarkable suppression of the growth
of metallic particles directly aﬀects the ability of the Pd–
perovskite catalyst to maintain a high catalytic activity.
Detailed analyses were carried out to elucidate the
mechanism of suppression of Pd grain growth. The
powder catalyst was exposed to the following treatment.
First, the catalyst was oxidized in air at 800 C for 1 h
(800-O). Then, the sample was reduced in 10% H2
balanced with N2 for 1 h at 800 C (800-OR). Finally,
the sample was re-oxidized in air for 1 h at the same
temperature (800-ORO). This successive single-run of
treatments creates a separate model for each of the key
stages of the evolution of the engine exhaust atmosphere
[1].
The states of Pd on the surface of powder catalysts
after oxidation, reduction and re-oxidation treatments
at 800 C were analyzed by means of X-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy (XPS). The results are shown in
ﬁgure 4 [2]. Binding energies were corrected based on
measured values for C1S. The values for Pd0 and Pd2+
were determined by comparison with metallic Pd and
PdO, respectively. The binding energy of Pd in oxidized
LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3 perovskite indicates an extraor-
dinarily high oxidation state of Pd3+ [2,3,23]. The Pd in
the reduced sample was found to be in the metallic state.
In the re-oxidized sample, the oxidation state of Pd was
once again estimated to be Pd3+.
To determine the distribution of Pd in the catalyst
more precisely, X-ray anomalous diﬀraction (XAD) was
measured at the bending-magnet beamline BL14B1 of
the 8 GeV synchrotron radiation source in SPring-8 [1].

catalyst,
LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3, after oxidation, reduction, and
re-oxidation treatments. The XRD patterns indicate
that the perovskite crystal structure is predominant.
After reduction treatment, the positions of the Bragg
reﬂections from (100) and (110) shifted to lower angles,
indicating an expansion of the crystal lattice and partial
transformation of the material into La(OH)3 via La2O3.
After re-oxidation
treatment, the
(100)
and (110)
reﬂections returned to the oxidized position, and the
La2O3 and La(OH)3 signals disappeared completely.

intensity for the oxidized catalyst. The cusp of the
intensity of these reﬂections at the Pd K-edge indicates
that Pd forms a solid solution with the perovskite
crystal. Furthermore, by considering the structure fac-
tors involved, the increase of (100) and the decrease of
(110) reﬂection intensities at the edge energy prove that

Pd occupies the B-site. On the other hand, the cusp of
the intensity was not observed for the reduced catalyst,
implying that Pd does not occupy any site in the
perovskite lattice of the reduced catalyst.
X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (XAFS) was also
measured at the bending-magnet beam line BL14B1 of
the 8-GeV synchrotron radiation source in SPring-8.
The spectra were measured near the Pd–K edge in
transmission mode because of the high transmissivity of
the X-ray. The photon energy was calibrated with a Pd
foil by assigning 24.350 keV to the energy at half the
edge jump.

gether with the XANES spectra of Pd-foil and PdO as
reference materials [1]. After oxidation treatment, the
chemical shift observed at the edge position indicated, as
did the XPS analysis, that Pd in LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3
perovskite is in the Pd3+ or Pd4+ state. Next, the edge
position of the reduced catalyst was identical to that of
Pd-foil, suggesting that Pd is in a metallic state. Finally,
after re-oxidation treatment, the edge position shifted
back to a higher energy.

after
redox
treatments
at
800 C, obtained by a standard XAFS analysis accord-
ing to McKale et al., is shown in Table 1 [1]. At ﬁrst, the
Pd in the sample oxidized at 800 C, occupies the B-site,
in a six-fold coordination with oxygen, of the unit
formula of ABO3 in the perovskite structure. When
the sample is reduced and Pd is segregated from the
perovskite crystal to form small metallic particles, the
peak shows a mixture of Pd–Pd and Pd–Co bonds. In
the re-oxidized sample, Pd is restored to the lattice of the
perovskite. The results of XRD, XPS, XAD, and XAFS
analyses indicate that Pd of the LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3
perovskite moves in a completely reversible manner
during sequential redox ﬂuctuations (Figure 8) [30].
4. Cobalt-free perovskite catalyst
A
new
Co-free
perovskite
powder
catalyst,
LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3, was prepared by the alkoxide method
[32,33]. The monolithic LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalysts were
also aged at 900 C for 100 h in an exhaust gas, and a
remarkable suppression of Pd particle growth was
conﬁrmed by TEM observation (ﬁgure 3).
The powder was exposed to the following treatments.
First, the catalyst was oxidized in air at 800 C for 1 h.
Secondly, the sample was reduced in 2.5% H2 and 7.5%
CO balanced with N2 for 1 h at 100, 200, 300, 400, 600,
or 800 C. Finally, the sample was re-oxidized in air for
1 h at the same temperatures as in the reductive
treatment (ﬁgure 9) [34–38].
The local structure parameters of the ﬁrst nearest
neighbor around the Pd in LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 after redox
treatments at 800 C are shown in table 2 [31,37,38].
The temperature dependency of the radial structure
function around Pd is shown in ﬁgure 10 [34–38].
At ﬁrst, Pd in the sample oxidized at 800 C (800-O)
occupied the B-site,
in six-fold coordination with
oxygen, of the unit formula of ABO3 in the perovskite
structure. When the sample was reduced and Pd was
segregated from the perovskite crystal to form small
metallic particles, the ﬁrst nearest peak height corre-
sponding to the Pd–O bond decreased, and the second
peak corresponding to the Pd–Pd bond increased as the
reduction
temperature
increased
from
200 C.
At
800 C, the peak showed a mixture of Pd–Pd and Pd–Fe
bonds (800-OR). Note that the summation of the weight
of both the Pd–Pd and Pd–Fe bonds is only 0.64,
implying that the deposited metal particle is very small.
In a re-oxidative atmosphere, the height of the Pd–Pd
bond decreased from 200 C (ﬁgure 10) [37,38]. After re-
oxidation at 800 C (800-ORO), the Pd–Pd bond dis-
appeared, and the local structure around Pd was

identical to that of the oxidized catalyst (800-O). The
results of XAFS analysis indicate that Pd in Co-free
LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite moves in a completely
reversible manner during subsequent redox ﬂuctuations.
For comparison with XAFS, the behavior of surface
Pd in the reduction treatment was also analyzed by XPS.
This showed that the ratio of metallic Pd on the surface
is higher than that in the bulk structure within the

temperature range 100–300 C (ﬁgure 11) [34–36]. This
suggests that reductive segregation of Pd begins near the
surface, and then Pd from the bulk of the perovskite
framework segregates later. Also, it is revealed that this
regenerative function of Pd occurs even at unexpectedly
low temperatures.

situ DXAFS trial at BL28B2 in SPring-8 [38]. An exam-
ple of the results of measurements of structural changes

changes very quickly. It can be concluded from this
measurement that the transient time for structural
change around Pd is only a few seconds at 600 C.
5. Development of perovskite catalyst for practical use
The speciﬁc surface areas for the perovskite-type
oxide and the support materials after thermal aging are
shown in ﬁgure 14 [39]. In order to overcome the
problem of a low surface area, composite technology
was developed for forming and dispersing the perovskite
crystal on the heat-resistant support material [16,39]. To
prevent reaction with perovskite, this support material
had to be newly developed in relation to the composi-
tion and preparation method.
Table 3 summarizes the main characteristics of the
full-scale monolithic catalysts for practical applications.

The composite perovskite material was located in the
lower layer to avoid sulfur poisoning, and Pt and Rh
were dispersed in the upper layer. A benchmark catalyst
was also prepared in-house as the standard representing
today’s heat-resistant catalyst technology: the amount
of precious metals loaded was 1.5 times that of the
intelligent catalyst. The conﬁgurations of the catalysts
are illustrated in ﬁgure 15 [30,39]. A Japan ULEV cat-
alyst, obtained in the marketplace, was also tested as a
reference at the same time.
The full-scale monolithic catalysts were attached to
an engine and exposed to exhaust gases at temperatures
of up to 1050 C for 40 h (ﬁgure 16) [30,39]. The results
for the catalytic activity, the 50% conversion tempera-
ture (T50), and the CO–NOx and HC–NOx cross-over
point conversions, are shown in ﬁgure 17.
The intelligent catalyst showed better characteristics
than the other catalysts, even though the amount of
precious metals used was small. The conversion per-
formance of the intelligent catalyst, up to a high gas ﬂow

conditions at the manifold position. The results are
shown in ﬁgure 18. The full-scale intelligent catalyst
exhibited excellent performance up to higher space
velocity (SV) conditions.
The sulfur tolerance of the full-scale intelligent cat-
alyst
was
investigated.
Dibutyl
disulﬁde,
[CH3(CH2)3S]2, was added to regular gasoline, and the
concentration of sulfur was adjusted to 500 ppm. The
test fuel contained 10 times more sulfur than is found
in normal fuel. The practical intelligent catalyst was
ﬁtted in the manifold position of the engine of a pas-
senger vehicle. The emission after the modal testing
was divided by the base emission in the absence of the
catalyst, and the catalytic activity was calculated. The
results of four sequential tests using the sulfurized
gasoline are shown in comparison with those for reg-
ular gasoline (ﬁgure 19). The vertical line on the ﬁgure
shows the deviation of catalytic activity from that at-
tained using regular gasoline. The quadrature axis
shows the test frequency, and the zero shows the result
for regular gasoline use. The deviation of activity
through modal tests was within 1% in conversion
eﬃciency.
The intelligent catalyst showed a high resistance to
deactivation by sulfur poisoning as a result of its
eﬀective design that placed the perovskite oxide in
the lower layer. In addition, since the catalyst was
mounted in the close-coupled position to the engine,

6. Conclusion
The self-regenerative function of precious metals in
the intelligent catalyst is an epoch-making technol-
ogy in the history of automotive catalysts after the
1970s. It can make contributions in various ﬁelds
related
to
society,
economics,
resources,
and
the
environment.
The modern gasoline engine has adopted a feed-
back control system that uses an oxygen sensor for
three-way catalysts to function, and the oxygen con-
centration of the exhaust gas component is always
ﬂuctuating. It has been shown that in the case of the
intelligent catalyst, the precious metal is always
rejuvenated by the action of the inherent ﬂuctuations
in the emissions, and thereby degradation of the cat-
alyst is prevented (ﬁgure 20). The intelligent catalyst
provides a new material design technology, and it is
expected that this technology will contribute consid-
erably
to
the
solution
of
the
supply-and-demand
problems
of
precious
metals
in
the
automotive
industries. By using this catalyst, the demand for
palladium can be reduced world wide by 100 tonnes/
year or more. The evaluation of the economic eﬀect,
taking account of the current price of palladium, is
left to the reader.
The author believes that the intelligent catalyst is an
important technology, not only for automobiles, but
also for various internal combustion engines. By further
development of this technology, a dream vehicle that
emits an exhaust gas that is cleaner than ambient air
could be achieved. Intelligent catalyst technology is
expected to be the key that opens the window for clean
air to blow in.
