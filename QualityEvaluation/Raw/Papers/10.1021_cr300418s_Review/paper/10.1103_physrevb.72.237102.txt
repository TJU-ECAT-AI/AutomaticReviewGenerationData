We address the issues raised in the preceding Comment by discussing the effects of an explicit account of the
nonlinear core correction NLCC into the Ce pseudopotential employed in our previous calculations of
reduced ceria Phys. Rev. B 71, 041102R 2005. At the plain density-functional-theory DFT level, such an
account brings our pseudopotential results in good agreement with all-electron ones, which do not predict the
insulating character of reduced ceria. At the DFT+U level, the inclusion of the NLCC has no effect on the
previously reported electronic structure and equilibrium geometries. The dependency of the DFT+U energy on
the choice of the projector functions deﬁning the Hubbard-U functional is discussed in further detail.

In a recent paper we have addressed the ability of density
functional theory DFT to model the electronic properties of
reduced ceria, that are determined by the quasi-degeneracy
of states in which Ce-4f electrons are localized or, in turn,
itinerant.1 Our main conclusion was that the addition of a
Hubbard-U term to the standard local-density LDA or
generalized-gradient GGA functionals stabilizes the insu-
lating solution, in which f electrons are localized, with re-
spect to the f-delocalized, metallic solution, thus consider-
ably enhancing the predictive power of DFT for these
systems. As a by-product of our investigation we also found
that: i the insulating solution is stable even at the plain
LDA or GGA levels i.e., without introducing any Hubbard-
U term, and that ii the calculated DFT+U energy depends
sensitively on the form of the atomiclike projector used to
deﬁne the Hubbard-U term. A suitable choice of this projec-
tor, based self-consistently on Wannier-Boys functions, re-
sults in energies which agree with those predicted by plain
DFT. In this framework, the main effect of the Hubbard-U
term would be to enhance the stability of the insulating so-
lution, without affecting its energy.
In a comment to our paper, Kresse et al.2 questioned the
ﬁrst of the above ﬁndings i by showing that all-electron
AE calculations always result in a metallic solution for
Ce2O3, when performed at the plain LDA or GGA levels.
They concluded that our ﬁndings are the result of an overes-
timate of the exchange 4f splitting intrinsic to our pseudo-
potential PP approach. In this reply we show that, while the
ﬁndings of Kresse et al. are basically correct, their conclu-
sions are not totally so, in that a simple account of the non-
linear core correction3 NLCC to the exchange-correlation
energy which we admittedly failed to consider in Ref. 1
would bring PP results in substantial agreement with AE
ones, making the insulating solution of Ce2O3 unstable at the
plain LDA or GGA levels. A proper account of the NLCC
within DFT+U does not have any noticeable effects on the
calculated equilibrium geometries, while the reduction ener-
gies calculated at the GGA+U level result to be in better
agreement with experiments than previously found.
In order to address the criticisms raised in Ref. 2, we have
repeated some of the calculations already presented in Ref. 1
using a newly generated Ce pseudopotential differing from
the one used in Ref. 1 only in the proper account for the
NLCC. The resulting ground state is metallic ferromagnetic
FM in plain DFT both at the LDA and GGA levels, see
Fig. 1a, in agreement with the AE predictions of Ref. 2.
The structural properties equilibrium lattice parameter, bulk
modulus, relaxed atomic coordinates of CeO2 and reduced
ceria are unaffected by the account for the NLCC. The anti-
ferromagnetic AF metallic solution for Ce2O3 is 0.09 eV
LDA and 0.11 eV GGA per formula unit higher in energy
than the FM metallic solution, again in good agreement with
AE predictions. These results demonstrate that our chosen
value for the core radius is not by itself responsible for the

observed discrepancy. In fact a simple account for the over-
lap between core and valence densities using the NLCC is
enough to bring the PP results in agreement with the AE
ones.
Coming now to the implementation of the Hubbard-U
term in the energy functional, the linear-response approach4
employed to calculate the value of the parameter U in the
ground state of Ce2O3 with the newly generated Ce PP gives
U=5.3 eV in the LDA and U=4.5 eV in the GGA. The
LDA+U and GGA+U density of electronic states for Ce2O3
are shown in Fig. 1b. The position of the occupied gap state
turns out to be still in good agreement with experiment,5–8
thus proving the internal consistency of the method. The
DFT+U electronic ground state for reduced ceria obtained
with the present PP is always insulating AF, as already
reported.1 The main effect of the account for the NLCC in
the DFT+U calculations is in the calculated values for the
reduction energies. We stress again that the DFT+U total
energy depends on the speciﬁc choice of the projector func-
tions used to deﬁne the Hubbard-U functional. In the case of
ceria, this dependency of the total energy on the value of U
tends to deteriorate the fair agreement with experiment that
can be obtained already at the plain GGA level. Figure 2
displays the dependence of the reduction energy CeO2
→1/2 Ce2O3+1/4 O2 on the Hubbard-U parameter ob-
tained with i the standard projector derived from Ce-4f
atomic orbitals  and ii with Wannier-Boys functions 
¯
obtained from the self-consistent electronic solution. The re-
duction energy calculated with the projector functions  de-
pends linearly on the value of U. Most importantly, the re-
duction energy obtained with the self-consistently calculated
values of U, delivering the correct position of the gap state in
the electronic structure, is 1.2 eV in LDA+U and 0.87 eV in
GGA+U open circle in Fig. 2. These values are in substan-
tially worse agreement with the available experimental data9
thin solid line in Fig. 2 than those calculated at the plain
LDA and GGA levels. On the contrary, the reduction energy
calculated with the Wannier-Boys orbitals 
¯ 2.97 eV in
LDA+U and 2.36 eV in GGA+U is effectively independent
on the speciﬁc value of U and, in the case of the GGA+U
calculations, it is in reasonable agreement with the experi-
mental value. The vacancy formation energies calculated in
the bulk with the present pseudopotentials and with the
Wannier-Boys projector functions are 6.74 eV LDA+U
and 5.55 eV GGA+U. The GGA result is now in better
agreement with experiment10 and with other GGA and
GGA+U values 4.7–5.4 eV reported in the literature.11,12
In conclusion, we thank the authors of Ref. 2 for pointing
out the need to improve with respect to our previous pseudo-
potential description of reduced ceria. The study presented
in this reply and prompted by Kresse et al. demonstrates
that—while all-electron calculations are a benchmark for
electronic structure calculations—pseudopotentials remain
an effective, accurate, and predictive tool when overlap ef-
fects between core and valence charge densities are properly
accounted for.
