Abstract
CeO2–ZrO2 oxides with different CeO2 content (1–12 wt%) were prepared by the impregnation method. The effects of CeO2 content,
calcination temperature and interaction between the components on the structure and reductive properties of CeO2–ZrO2 oxides were
evaluated by using different techniques such as XRD, DRS, FTIR, Raman, XPS, TGA and TPR. Spectroscopic data showed that the tetragonal
phase of zirconia is preserved in all CeO2–ZrO2 oxides, although they retain a high number of defect sites caused by a strong interaction
between zirconia and cerium oxide species. An enrichment of the zirconia surface with a ﬂuorite structure of CeO2 is observed for the CeO2–
ZrO2 oxide with the highest CeO2 content (12 wt%). The samples subjected to consecutive reduction–oxidation cycles at different
temperatures showed good redox properties related to the increase of oxygen mobility. It was concluded that these CeO2–ZrO2 oxide
systems, displaying high surface and good thermal stability, are similar to chemically mixed oxides due to the strong interaction between the
zirconia carrier and deposited ceria.

1. Introduction
When used as supports, oxides such as ceria and zirconia are
known to impart metal-support interactions to enhance catalytic
performances, due to the oxygen-storage/transport character-
istics of the support [1] or to the generation of active centres at
the interface between metal and support [2–4]. Ceria and ceria-
based mixed oxides are effective carriers or catalysts for
important industrial or environmentally friendly reactions, such
as automotive exhaust gas conversion [5], methane reforming
processes [6,7], water–gas shift reaction [8,9], etc. An oxygen-
storage component in the form of ceria-containing oxide can
be included in the catalyst to decrease coke deposition on the
active phase for CH4 reforming catalysts or to moderate the
effect of the oscillations between reach and lean conditions for
the three-way catalysts operating under atmospheric pressure.
Cerium oxide is widely employed as a promoter for supported-
noble metal catalysts due to its advantages: (i) to stabilize the
metal dispersion on the carrier; (ii) to improve the oxidation and
reduction of the noble metal; (iii) to enhance oxygen storage
and release by shifting between CeO2 under oxidizing
conditions and Ce2O3 under reducing conditions, respectively.
However, the major problem of CeO2 when used as a carrier is
the loss of oxygen storage capacity (OSC) due to a reduction in
surface area upon thermal treatment. Insertion of zirconia into
the cubic CeO2 framework with formation of a solid solution
results in increased thermal stability and improved redox
properties due to the high efﬁciency of the Ce4+ , Ce3+ redox
cycle [10–12].
The mixed CexZr1  xO2 oxides, as a new generation of
oxygen storage capacity systems, have recently been reported
in many studies. The distortion of the O2 sublattices in the
mixed oxides permits a higher mobility of lattice oxygen, and
the reduction occurs not only on the surface but also extends
deep into the bulk [13]. Ceria stabilized zirconia has attracted
attention in recent years due not only to its good mechanical

and electrical properties, but also to its application as catalysts,
given their good stability and redox properties. However, the
properties of these materials largely depend on the preparation
method, the nature of the present phases and their content. It
has been shown that phase segregation of binary oxides could
be suppressed by doping with proper elements. The substitu-
tion of zirconium atoms by iron ones can generate oxygen
vacancies in the tetragonal network of ZrO2–CeO2 system
prepared by the solid-state route, or phase segregation could be
inhibited by doping the mixed oxide with rare earth elements
[14,15].
It is worth noting that the most frequently used methods for
obtaining a binary oxide system are sol–gel and ﬁring of
mechanically ground mixtures of the oxide precursors at high
temperatures [16,17]. Ceria–zirconia mixed oxides have
recently been prepared by continuous hydrothermal synthesis
in supercritical water, resulting in a homogeneous complex
with highly crystallized nanoparticles [18]. However, such
methods ensure the formation of a solid solution, and products
are highly dense, lacking the surface area and pore volume
desired for catalytic applications.
An important feature associated with binary CeO2–ZrO2
systems is to improve their low-temperature reducibility at
moderate temperatures or their oxygen storage/release capa-
city. It is well known that the reducibility of the carrier of
supported metal catalysts is a very important issue regarding its
ability to generate oxygen vacancies and transfer the oxygen
onto the metal particles. This refers to redox behaviour that is
relevant to catalysis and considers all the characteristics of the
reduction and oxidation processes.
The objective of our work is to stabilize highly dispersed
ceria on zirconia and obtain ceria–zirconia oxides with high
thermal stability and surface area and good redox properties.
The high thermal stability and high reducibility of these oxides
would make them very attractive carriers for supported Pt
catalysts for CH4 reforming reactions. The work is focused on
the effect of: (i) CeO2 content; (ii) temperature of calcination;
(iii) interaction between the components on the structure and
reductive properties of CeO2–ZrO2 oxides. Different techni-
ques were used for characterization of the samples: X-ray
diffraction (XRD), UV–vis diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy
(DRS),
Fourier-transform
infrared
spectroscopy
(FTIR),
Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), tem-
perature-programmed reduction (TPR) and thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA).
2. Experimental
2.1. Sample preparation
The ZrO2 was obtained by calcination of zirconium
hydroxide, kindly provided by Eurosupport, The Netherlands.
The CeO2–ZrO2 supports were obtained by impregnation of
ZrO2 with an aqueous solution of diammonium hexanitrate
cerate (NH4)2[Ce(NO3)6] (99.99% pure from Degussa). The
obtained solids were dried in air at 383 K for 12 h and were
calcined at 823 and 1073 K for 4 h. The theoretical amount of
CeO2 was in the range of 1–12 wt%. The samples were denoted
as xCeO2–ZrO2, where x is the theoretical amount of CeO2. For
comparative purposes, a CeO2 was obtained by calcination of
(NH4)2[Ce(NO3)6] at 923 and 1073 K for 4 h.
2.2. Methods
Chemical analysis of calcined samples was determined by
inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy
(ICP-AES) using a PerkinElmer Optima 3300DV instrument.
The CeO2 loading of the samples is summarized in Table 1.
The textural properties of the calcined samples were
evaluated from the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms,
determined at 77 K with a Micromeritics TriStar 3000
apparatus. The samples were previously degassed at 423 K
for 24 h under vacuum (104 mbar) to ensure a relatively clean
surface. The speciﬁc areas of the samples were determined
according to standard BET procedure using nitrogen adsorption
data taken in the relative equilibrium pressure interval of
0.03 < P/P0 < 0.3.
XRD measurements of the calcined samples were performed
on a computerized Seifert 3000XRD diffractometer using Cu
Ka (l = 0.1538 nm) radiation and a PW 2200 Bragg–Brentano
u/2u goniometer equipped with a bent graphite monochromator
and an automatic slit. The XRD diffraction patterns were taken
in the 2u range of 5–808 at a scan speed of 0.048/s. Phase
identiﬁcation was carried out by comparison with JCPDF
database cards. The particle size of ZrO2 crystallites was
determined by means of the Scherrer equation [19] using the
most intensive reﬂections.
UV–vis diffuse reﬂectance spectra of the calcined samples
were recorded in the range of 200–800 nm at room temperature
using a Varian Cary 5000 UV–vis spectrometer equipped with
an integration sphere. The framework (400–800 cm1) vibra-
tions were recorded on a Nicolet 5ZDX FTIR spectro-
photometer. The calcined samples were diluted in KBr
(0.05 wt% of sample in KBr) and pressed into transparent
discs. Typically, 100 scans were recorded at a resolution of
4 cm1 using a MCT-B detector.
The Raman spectra were run with a Renishaw Micro-Raman
System 1000 equipped with a cooled CCD detector (200 K) and
a holographic Notch ﬁlter that removes the elastic scattering.
The samples were excited with the 514 nm Ar line in an in situ
cell (Linkam, TS-1500), which allows temperature treatments
of up to 1770 K under gas ﬂow. The samples were in powder
form to prevent diffusion problems and ensure that all the

catalyst in the cell is exposed to the gas ﬂow. The spectral
resolution is 3 cm1, and the spectra acquisition consisted of 20
accumulations of 30 s for each sample. The samples calcined at
1073 K were pre-treated in air at 773 K for 30 min.
Surface analysis was carried out on a VG Escalab 200R
electron spectrometer provided with Al Ka (hn = 1486.6 eV,
1 eV = 1.6302  1019 J) X-ray source and a hemi-spherical
electron analyser. The powder samples pressed in 8 mm
diameter copper troughs were ﬁxed onto the XYZ manipulator.
The base pressure in the analysis chamber was maintained
below 4  109 mbar during data acquisition. The binding
energies (BE) of Zr 3d, Ce 3d and O 1s core-levels were
recorded. The binding energies were referenced to the C1s peak
at 284.6 eV. The accuracy of the BE values was 0.1 eV. Data
processing was performed with the XPS peak program, and the
spectra were decomposed with the least squares ﬁtting routine
provided with the software with Gaussian/Lorentzian (90/10)
product function and after subtracting a Shirley background.
Atomic fractions were calculated using peak areas normalized
on the basis of sensitivity factors.
Temperature-programmed reduction proﬁles of the calcined
samples were obtained on a semiautomatic Micromeritics TPD/
TPR 2900 apparatus interfaced with a computer. Samples of
50 mg placed in a U-shaped quartz tube were ﬁrst purged in a
He ﬂow at 473 K for 0.5 h and then cooled to ambient
temperature. The TPR proﬁles of the fresh samples were
recorded on the previously degassed sample by passing a
10 wt% H2/Ar gas mixture (60 ml/min) through the sample
heated at a constant rate of 15 K/min from room temperature to
1173 K. A cold trap was placed just before the thermo-
conductivity detector (TCD) to remove water from the exit
stream. Samples denoted as R-O773 and R-O1073 were subjected
to redox treatment, which consists of H2-TPR to 1173 K
followed by in situ oxidation with an oxygen ﬂow (70 ml/min)
at 773 and 1073 K for 2 h, respectively.
Thermogravimetric analysis experiments in Ar/H2 (5%)
ﬂow (total ﬂow 100 ml/min) were recorded with TGA/SDTA
851e Mettler Toledo. Each sample was treated in a N2
atmosphere at 553 K for 30 min. They were then heated at a
constant rate (10 K/min) to 673 K and kept at that temperature
for 15 min to remove the adsorbed water. Finally, the Ar/H2
mixture was introduced while keeping the temperature at 773 K
for 30 min. The observed weight loss due to oxygen removal by
H2 to form water was associated with the total oxygen storage
capacity at that temperature [15].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Textural properties
Table 1 lists the most important textural parameters
calculated from the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms:
the speciﬁc surface area BET (SBET) and pore volume (Vp). The
representative isotherms of the samples are shown in Fig. 1. The
shape of the isotherms of CeO2–ZrO2 oxides is similar to that of
ZrO2 and belongs to type I/II of the IUPAC classiﬁcation [20].
At low relative pressure, the prevailing process is the formation
of a monolayer of adsorbed molecules, while multilayer
adsorption takes place at high relative pressure. Type I/II
isotherms are typical for micro- and macroporous materials.
The isotherms of the samples have hysteresis loops belonging
to H1 type according to IUPAC, typical for mesoporous
materials [20]. The isotherm of CeO2 showed that ceria has
micropores.
The calcined CeO2–ZrO2 samples have speciﬁc areas in the
range of 204–180 m2/g (Table 1). The CeO2 content 6 wt%
does not affect the textural properties of the mixed oxides.
However, the CeO2 content of 12 wt% leads to a slight decrease
in both speciﬁc area and pore volume of ceria–zirconia oxide.
The stabilization effect of ceria on the textural properties of
zirconia is evident at low ceria loadings. The same variation in
the textural properties with CeO2 loading was observed for
CeO2–Al2O3 system [21]. The surface areas decreased by 20–
30% after treatment of the ZrO2 and CeO2–ZrO2 samples at a
high temperature of 1073 K.
3.2. Structure and surface properties
3.2.1. XRD
The diffraction patterns of the mixed CeO2–ZrO2 oxides
calcined at 823 and 1073 K are compared in Fig. 2A and B,
respectively. Pure CeO2 sample calcined at 923 and 1073 K
(Fig. 2A and B, respectively) is composed of cubic CeO2 with
ﬂuorite structure at 2u = 28.78, 47.68 and 56.48 [21]. X-ray

diffraction pattern of ZrO2 at 823 K (Fig. 2A) shows poorly
resolved peaks of zirconia, indicating an amorphous phase. The
addition of a small amount of ceria to zirconia leads to the
appearance of broad peaks, characteristic of zirconia, at
2u = 30.28, 50.48 and 44.78 (Fig. 2). The characteristic peaks of
ZrO2 are well resolved after high temperature treatment of the
samples at 1073 K (Fig. 2B). The broadness of the XRD peaks
exhibited by the calcined samples means that it is not possible
to use the X-ray results to establish clearly whether the formed
phase is tetragonal or cubic. It is known that the XRD patterns
of the cubic and the tetragonal zirconia modiﬁcations are nearly
identical [22]; the only difference is that the tetragonal phase
shows a limited number of additional high order, low intensity
reﬂections due to its lower degree of symmetry. However, the
tetragonal and cubic phases may be readily identiﬁed and
distinguished by other spectroscopic techniques.
No indication of phase splitting is detected after calcination
of the CeO2–ZrO2 oxides at higher temperature (1073 K,
Fig. 2B). However, this cannot exclude the presence of different
arrangements of oxygen sublattice or the presence of a multi-
phase system at nanoscale level after high temperature
treatment. A slight shift of 2u8 to a lower angle is observed
for the sample with the highest CeO2 content compared to that
of ZrO2 (from 30.68 to 30.18), suggesting an enrichment of the
zirconia surface with ceria.
XRD data show that the calculated average particle size of
ZrO2 (DXRD) in CeO2–ZrO2 oxides is not too strongly affected
by the increase of CeO2 content (Table 1). An estimate of
average particle size by the line broadening method gives a
value of around 6 nm. The increase of calcination temperature
to 1073 K leads to a less pronounced effect on the crystallite
size of ZrO2 (to about 7 nm). There is a signiﬁcant increase in
the crystallite size of CeO2 at high temperature treatment (from
9.8 to 29.4 nm at 823 and 1073 K, respectively, Table 1).
It is clear from these results that a signiﬁcant sintering of
ZrO2 does not occur during calcination up to 1073 K. It
suggests that the resistance of ZrO2 to phase transformation is
probably due to its ability to retain small particle size
forthcoming during the preparation procedure.
3.2.2. DR-UV–vis spectroscopy
The electronic spectra of the samples calcined at 823 and
1073 K are shown in Fig. 3A and B, respectively. A split of the
absorption is observed at 276 and 342 nm in the spectrum of
pure ceria (Fig. 3A). The former can be related to O2 ! Ce4+
charge transfer transitions in agreement with Refs. [23,24]. A
main absorption at 211 nm with a shoulder in the region of 290–
400 nm is observed in the spectrum of pure zirconia (Fig. 3A).
The absorption edge appearing at higher energies (211 nm) is
attributed to the charge transfer transitions of O2 ! Zr2+ [23].
According to the d0 conﬁguration of Zr4+ ions, no feature
characteristics of d–d transitions are displayed in the visible
region (above 400 nm) in the electronic spectrum of zirconia
(Fig. 3A). The occurrence of the second component in the
spectrum of zirconia is very likely due to the presence of
impurities

species

wavelength [23].
It should be noted that the overall absorption of the CeO2–
ZrO2 oxides is signiﬁcantly higher than that of pure zirconia
(Fig. 3). Two maxima can be distinguished (Fig. 3A) in the
electronic spectra of the mixed oxides treated at 823 K. The ﬁrst
maximum centred at 211 nm is related to the transitions on pure
zirconia. The second one is centred at 295 nm. There is no
connection between the position of the second maximum in the
spectra of the mixed oxides and their composition. However,
the intensity of the second maximum rises with increasing
CeO2 content in the CeO2–ZrO2 samples. On the other hand,
the value of the second maximum is an intermediate of the
values for the split absorption of pure ceria. This means that the
zirconia surface is covered with cerium oxide species.
When comparing the electronic spectra in Fig. 3A and B, it is
evident that the sintering process, which takes place at 1073 K,

89
results in a loss of intensity of the electronic spectra of all
samples. The position of both maxima shifts to higher energies.
The main maximum for pure zirconia and zirconia-supported
samples is shifted from 211 to 204 nm. Whereas the position of
the second one in the spectra of the samples is related to the
composition of the mixed oxides; it shifts to lower energies with
the increase of CeO2 content (from 265 to 280 nm for 1CeO2–
ZrO2 and 12CeO2–ZrO2, respectively). Moreover, the position
of the edge onset is slightly higher than that for the oxides
treated at low temperature. The shift of the absorption onset to
lower energies is probably associated with the larger crystal
size of the oxides calcined at 1073 K compared to those at low
calcination temperature.
3.2.3. FTIR spectra
The IR spectra of pure ceria, zirconia and CeO2–ZrO2
samples after calcination at 823 and 1073 K are shown in
Fig. 4A and B, respectively. A broad absorption at ca. 460 cm1
with a less well-deﬁned shoulder at ca. 430 cm1 is displayed in
the IR spectrum of pure ceria previously calcined at 923 K
(Fig. 4A). According to literature data [25] on the vibrational
active modes in the ﬂuorite structure, the main maximum would
be assigned to the transverse mode (TO) of the triply
degenerated F1u fundamental, and the shoulder to the
longitudinal component (LO) of the same fundamental.
The IR spectrum of pure zirconia treated at 823 K (Fig. 4A)
displays
an
intense
absorption
with
less
well-resolved
components at about 516 and 596 cm1. The breadth of the
peak is anomalous owing to a structural disorder associated
with oxygen vacancies [23]. Two bands associated with the
movements of oxide ions, both undergoing TO–LO splitting,
are expected in the 400–650 cm1 range [24]. The IR active
mode in the 600–650 cm1 range is caused by asymmetrically
coupled asymmetric Zr–O–Zr stretching, and the mode arising
from the symmetric Zr–O–Zr stretching is revealed in the 400–
500 cm1 region [24]. The IR spectra of the mixed CeO2–ZrO2

oxides with CeO2 content up to 6 wt% do not vary strongly
compared to that of pure zirconia. The intensity of the low-
wavenumber component increases slightly with the increasing
CeO2 content, as seen in Fig. 4A. However, the IR spectrum of
the CeO2–ZrO2 sample with the highest CeO2 content (12 wt%)
reveals a strong absorption with a maximum at about
500 cm1 nm and a poorly deﬁned shoulder in the higher
wavenumber range. The shifting of the maximum from
516 cm1 to lower wavenumber with the increasing CeO2
content, near to that observed for pure ceria, means that a
ﬂuorite-like phase becomes predominant in CeO2 richer
samples.
After
treatment of the mixed oxides at the higher
temperature of 1073 K (Fig. 4B), the intensity of the right
component of the absorption at ca. 600 cm1 increases
compared to that for pure zirconia. This is more pronounced
for samples with CeO2 content lower than 12 wt%. In addition,
this component is moved to a higher wavenumber (up to
620 cm1) for the sample with 6 wt% CeO2. This phenomenon
is similar to the case when a tetragonal solid solution phase is
formed and a distortion of the unit cell in CeO2–ZrO2 mixed
oxides occurs [24,25]. Although our samples are prepared by
the conventional impregnation method, there is a strong
grafting of ceria on the zirconia surface.
3.2.4. Raman spectra
Since the information provided by IR spectroscopy is less
relevant due to its lower sensitivity (broadening of the peaks
and LO–TO splitting) to unit cell distortions, Raman spectro-
scopy was applied to determine the coordination symmetry of
cations in the mixed CeO2–ZrO2 oxides. The Raman spectra of
the pure (ZrO2, CeO2) and mixed CeO2–ZrO2 oxides calcined
at 1073 K are shown in Fig. 5. It should be noted that the Raman
spectra of zirconia and CeO2–ZrO2 samples calcined at 823 K
did not reveal any band from ZrO2. However, broad bands at
148, 268, 311, 450 and 635 cm1 are detected in the Raman
spectrum of pure ZrO2 at 1073 K, which is characteristic of the
tetragonal zirconia phase. The present results are similar to
those reported in Refs. [25,26]. Six-Raman-active modes of
A1g + 3Eg + 2B1g symmetry are typical for the tetragonal ZrO2
phase (space group P42/nmc) [25,26], whereas only one F2g
mode centred at ca. 490 cm1 is Raman active for the cubic
ﬂuorite structure (space group Fm3m) [27]. In the Raman
spectrum of pure ceria, which also has a ﬂuorite structure, the
F2g mode is centred at 456 cm1, as seen in Fig. 5. A high
frequency broadening of the 450 nm band is observed after the
addition of ceria to zirconia due to some overlapping with the
band of the cubic phase (Fig. 5). The attenuation of the Raman
spectra of the CeO2–ZrO2 samples is probably caused by the
high concentration of oxygen vacancies formation resulting
from cerium reduction [11], due to a strong interaction between
zirconium and cerium oxide species occurring under the high
temperature calcination process. Kim et al. [28] have observed
two strong bands at 263 and 148 cm1 in the pure tetragonal
ZrO2, whose frequencies shift towards lower values in the
tetragonal t-Ce0.12Zr0.88O2 mixed oxide caused by defect sites.
The presence of a signiﬁcant amount of defects in the binary
CeO2–ZrO2 oxides was revealed by density measurements [29],
and not even their precise nature was ascertained. Due to the
broadness and overlapping of the bands of ZrO2 and CeO2, it is
difﬁcult to say whether there is a co-presence of a tetragonal
and a cubic phase. However, it is suggested that the spectra of
CeO2–ZrO2 with the highest CeO2 loading contains both
phases. The formation of nanocrystalline CeO2 oxide phase is
expected to be less efﬁcient at low CeO2 concentrations
(<12 wt%).
3.2.5. XPS studies
Photoelectron spectroscopy was used to obtain further
information about the valence/oxidation state of the elements
and surface composition of the Ce–Zr mixed oxides by
inspecting the spectral line shape and the intensities of the Ce
3d core-level electrons. Fig. 6 compares the Ce 3d spectra of the
CeO2–ZrO2 oxides calcined at 823 K with that of the Ce 3d
spectrum of pure CeO2. The BEs of Ce 3d5/2, Zr 3d5/2 and O 1s
core-levels and surface atomic Ce/Ce + Zr ratios are listed in
Table 2. The satellites and the main peaks are clearly identiﬁed
in the spectrum of CeO2 and they are similar to those reported
by Burroughs et al. [30]. According to the complexity in the
resolution of the spectra of CeO2 [29], peaks denoted as u and n
correspond to Ce 3d3/2 and Ce 3d5/2 contributions at 882.7 and
900 eV, respectively. Ce 3d spectrum of CeO2 is characteristic
of strong satellites at 888.8 (vII), 898.7 (vIII) and 907.6 (uII),
916.9 (uIII) eV. Comparing the observed Ce 3d spectra, it can be
concluded that all samples (Fig. 6) show distinct spectral
features compared to that of CeO2 (Fig. 6). A new component

(vI) at about 885 eV appeared in the spectra of CeO2–ZrO2
samples. The growth of the line vI and disappearance of vII
component indicate that the electronic conﬁguration of cerium
is far from 4+. In addition, the decrease of the intensity of the
Ce4+ satellite at 916.7 eV (uIII) is taken as an indication of the
presence of Ce3+ [31]. Thus, both the shape and the intensity of
satellites of Ce 3d spectrum of the mixed Ce–Zr oxides are
indicative of the presence of cerium in different oxidation
states, Ce4+ and Ce3+. Through ﬁtting of the Ce 3d proﬁle to
eight components, the ratio (r) of the area of the satellite at
916.7 eV to the total area was calculated. Assuming that this
ratio is proportional to the surface concentration of Ce4+ and
that this ratio reaches 0.16 for all cerium atoms in the Ce4+ state,
the percent fraction r = Ce4+/(Ce3+ + Ce4+) was calculated. The
3CeO2–ZrO2 sample displayed the lowest r value (38), then it
increased for 6CeO2–ZrO2 (44), 12CeO2–ZrO2 (56) and
1CeO2–ZrO2 (75), while r reached 94 for bulk CeO2.
As mentioned above, the broadening of the lines in the XPS
of CeO2–ZrO2 samples can be caused by the presence of several
surface cerium oxide species. Non-stoichiometric CeO2  x
(0 < x > 0.5) is probably formed due to a strong interaction
between supported CeO2 and ZrO2 carrier under calcination. In
addition, it should be noted that some photoreduction of Ce4+
might take place during exposure of the samples to a high X-ray
ﬂux under ultra-high vacuum employed during data acquisition.
We can thus conclude that the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple exists on
the surface of the fresh CeO2–ZrO2 oxides.
The change in the coordination number of Ce atoms is
conﬁrmed by the change in the BE values of Ce 3d5/2 core levels
(Table 2). For all CeO2–ZrO2 samples, there is a decrease in the
values of BE of Ce 3d5/2 component (882.3 eV) compared to
that for bulk CeO2 (882.9 eV). This shift can be interpreted in
terms of the interaction between zirconia and cerium oxide
species, i.e. Ce–O–Zr bond formation. It is likely that oxygen
vacancies are easily generated at the Ce–O–Zr interface. As
ZrO2 oxide is the major oxide phase in the ZrO2–CeO2 systems,
the BEs of Zr 3d5/2 core-levels (182.1 eV) are essentially the
same for all CeO2–ZrO2 samples and identical to that of pure
zirconia. An idea of the dispersion degree reached by ceria on
the zirconia substrate can be obtained from the surface Ce/
(Ce + Zr) atomic ratios. Experimental Ce/(Ce + Zr) surface
ratios are collected in Table 2 and compared with the nominal
ones assuming that ceria has been uniformly distributed within
the CeO2–ZrO2 system. It is evident from this comparison that
the surface of CeO2–ZrO2 is CeO2-enriched, and that this
enrichment is more marked at the highest CeO2 loading
(12 wt%).
3.3. Redox properties
3.3.1. TPR
The reducibility of the carrier of supported metal catalysts is
a very important issue in connection with its ability to generate
oxygen vacancies and transfer the oxygen onto the metal
particles.
The TPR proﬁles of fresh ceria, zirconia and CeO2–ZrO2
oxides calcined at 823 K and the effects of subsequent
reoxidation and reduction cycles are compared in Fig. 7a–f.
The calculated H2 consumptions per gram of material and the
positions of the TPR peaks are summarized in Table 3. Bulk
CeO2 exhibits two peaks: the small one at ca. 816 K and the big
one with a maximum at ca. 1080 K (Fig. 7f). As reported in
literature [32], the reduction of ceria occurs in two steps: the
bulk reduction occurs at temperatures above 1023 K, while the

surface shell reduction step takes place at a much lower
temperature. Surface shell reduction involves several phenom-
ena [33], including: (i) reduction of the surface Ce atoms from
Ce4+ to Ce3+ oxidation state; (ii) formation of bridging OH
groups. The area of the low-temperature peak is lower
compared to that of the high-temperature peak, which is
typical for low-surface area samples [34]. A good relationship
was found between the BET surface area and H2 consumption

from the ﬁrst peak, indicating that the reduction of ceria occurs
ﬁrst on the surface and then progressively affects the bulk. The
highest temperature peak can therefore be attributed to the
complete reduction of Ce4+ into Ce3+ by removing O2 anions
of the lattice and the formation of Ce2O3. It should be
remembered that the CeO2 used in the TPR experiments was
prepared by calcination at 1023 K and the surface area of the
sample is relatively low.
Intense H2 consumption with poorly resolved maxima at 856
and 908 K is observed in the TPR proﬁle of the fresh ZrO2
(Fig. 7a and Table 3). The observed reducibility for ZrO2 is
unusual since no reduction of ZrO2 has been detected in many
reports. Indeed, the XPS spectrum of pure ZrO2 precluded the
presence of carbonates and other impurities. As this behaviour
appears to be associated to the kind of zirconia phase and also to
the method of preparation, it is suggested that the H2
consumption peak formation is caused by the formation of
the type II bridging OH groups, as observed by Pigos et al. [35].
The TPR proﬁles of CeO2–ZrO2 oxides differ compared to
that of pure ZrO2. The difference is probably due to the type of
interaction strength between supported cerium oxide species
and zirconia carrier. The addition of ceria causes a shift in the
temperature of the surface reduction process on zirconia to
lower values (Fig. 7); the maximum of the main peak in the TPR
of the fresh CeO2–ZrO2 samples is shifted to lower values with
increasing CeO2 content. On the other hand, the low intense
peak to the left of the main peak revealed in the TPR proﬁles of
the samples with higher CeO2 content (6 wt%) (Fig. 7d and e)
is due to a reduction of cerium oxide species. It should be noted
that this reduction occurs at a lower temperature (below 770 K)
compared to that observed for bulk ceria. Doping zirconium
atoms into ceria could facilitate the oxygen transport from bulk
to surface [36]. Traces from Ce2O3 at 1101 K are observed in
the TPR proﬁle of the sample with the highest CeO2 content
(12 wt%, Fig. 7e). The calculated hydrogen consumption for
CeO2–ZrO2 samples increases with the increase of CeO2
content (Table 3).
The redox properties of the pure oxides, as well as of the
mixed oxides, subjected to different treatments, are shown in
Fig. 7. The characteristic peak in TPR proﬁles due to the surface
reduction of the fresh materials disappeared after subjecting the
samples to reoxidation at 773 K (R-O773) (Fig. 7). All samples
show marked enhancement of the low-temperature reducibility
relative to that of the fresh samples. This improved low-
temperature reducibility is especially dominant for mixed
CeO2–ZrO2 samples. The easy reduction should be caused by
the increasing oxygen mobility in the structure of ceria–
zirconia oxides.
A strong peak at 652 K accompanied by a small one at 904 K
is detected for pure ZrO2 subjected to R-O773 (Fig. 7a). By
contrast, for pure ceria subjected to R-O773 (Fig. 7f), the peak at
a low-temperature range is signiﬁcantly lower compared to that
at 1080 K from bulk reduction. The shoulder at ca. 757 K on the
high-temperature side of the 646 K peak is probably due to a
formation of non-stoichiometric cerium oxide species [34].
Non-stoichiometric ceria has been obtained from perfect
stoichiometry of ceria heated at 773 K in air [37], in vacuum
or in a hydrogen atmosphere [38], with no detectable departure
from the original structure.
It is difﬁcult to separate the species corresponding to the
reduction of cerium or zirconium oxide species and their
relative amounts of H2 consumed in the TPR proﬁles of mixed
CeO2–ZrO2 oxides due to the width of the peaks and their
overlapping. Two TPR peaks are observed for mixed oxides
with the lowest CeO2 content after R-O773 (Fig. 7b): a big one at
649 K and a small one at 806 K. The ﬁrst peak coincides with
that for pure zirconia, but the second one can be related to a
reduction of cerium oxide species. A shift of the peak
maximum to higher values with the increase of CeO2 content up
to 6 wt% is observed (from 649 to 700 K and from 806 to 840 K
for 1CeO2–ZrO2 and 6CeO2–ZrO2, respectively). After that,
the peak maximum is again shifted to a lower value for the
sample with the highest CeO2 content. In addition, H2
consumption is also increased with the CeO2 content (Table 3).
A further point worth noting is that the reduction in fresh
samples starts at a higher temperature than that of the recycled
samples at R-O773. The higher ionic character of the Zr–O bond
compared to that of Ce–O bond promotes the hydrophilic
character of the ZrO2 surface, rendering surface rehydroxyla-
tion an easy process. Upon thermal treatment, the ZrO2 surface
shows a depletion of surface oxygen, that is, an indication of
Lewis type acidity [39]. Accordingly, we suggest that a
progressive elimination of the surface OH groups occurs with
the increasing temperature during the TPR experiment, which
could generate surface sites of strong Lewis acidity. Therefore,
such sites may play a role in H2 activation, accounting for the
lower temperature of the surface reduction after recycling
(Fig. 7). In addition, the high surface area favours surface
reduction at a lower temperature similar to the observation for
mixed Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 oxides prepared by sol–gel method [11],
where modiﬁcation of the surface properties accounted for the
variation of the initial temperature of the reduction.

temperature reducibility, more evident for high CeO2 loaded
samples. H2 consumption increases signiﬁcantly for all samples
(Table 3).
It can be concluded that the redox behaviour of the samples
after
R-O1073
is
modiﬁed,
since
the
reduction
occurs
concurrently at the surface and in the bulk. The shoulder on
the high temperature side of the broad peak at about 1093 K in
the TPR proﬁles of the samples subjected to R-O1073 is
attributed to a bulk reduction of zirconia, as well as to the
reduction of CeO2 to Ce2O3 (Fig. 7). The maximum of the
shoulder is moved to a lower temperature after addition of a
small amount of CeO2 to ZrO2 (Table 3), thereby facilitating the
bulk reduction of the zirconia phase. The presence of two peaks
for bulk reduction was previously reported for solid solution
Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 [11], and it was attributed to clustering of bulk
oxygen vacancies.

It is generally accepted that the low-temperature process
accounts for reduction of the surface. It has been observed [18]
that bulk reduction may prevail due to the high-temperature
redox aging, while the role of surface reduction diminishes. It
was suggested that the lattice oxygen should migrate more
easily in the bulk after some redox aging treatment of binary
CeO2–ZrO2 oxides obtained by co-precipitation and super-
critical synthesis [1,16,18]. It can be assumed that the surface
shell reduction as well as the bulk reduction of ZrO2 and mixed
CeO2–ZrO2 samples is occurred. This could be associated with
an increase in defect sites on zirconia phase due to the deeper
incorporation of ceria into zirconia causing increased oxygen
mobility [1,11]. By contrast, the highest reduction degree of
CeO2 is mainly due to the bulk reduction of the larger ceria
crystallites (Table 1).
CeO2–rich samples show higher H2 consumption after
reoxidation at both temperatures compared to those of the fresh
samples and pure ZrO2 (Table 3). A partial segregation of Ce3+
occurs on the surface of the oxides due to the higher ionic radii
of Ce3+ (1.1 A
˚ ) compared to that of Ce4+ (0.97 A
˚ ) and Zr4+
(0.84 A
˚ ) [40]. Upon reoxidation, the segregated cerium cations
form small ceria-rich clusters on top of the oxides. The surface
segregation of cerium species is conﬁrmed by the increasing
surface atomic Ce/Ce + Zr ratio (Table 2). The reduction of the
surface and the bulk of this new ceria-rich phase could be
responsible for the enhanced reducibility of the mixed CeO2–
ZrO2 oxides after high-temperature redox aging.
The TGA proﬁles of the samples showed weight loss against
time under H2/N2 atmosphere at 773 K. According to Trovarelli
et al. [15] the weight loss due to the removal of oxygen with
formation of water was related to a measurement of OSC. The
weight loss of the samples decreases in the following order:
12CeO2–ZrO2 > 6CeO2–ZrO2 > 3CeO2–ZrO2  1CeO2–
ZrO2  ZrO2 > CeO2. An unusually low OSC is obtained for
CeO2. It should be noted that the CeO2 sample was obtained at
high calcination temperature (1073 K) and the contribution of
the surface shell reduction is low, as seen in the TPR proﬁle of
ceria (Fig. 7f). However, ceria rich samples have high OSC (6
and 12 wt%) showing high H2 consumptions (Table 3). Since
total OSC is correlated to more subtle structural features, H2
consumption values extracted from TPR could therefore
sometimes be considered as total OSC [15].
4. Conclusions
Although CeO2–ZrO2 oxides are not true mixed oxides,
being prepared by impregnation of ZrO2 with a solution of
cerium nitrate, the results clearly indicate that a strong
interaction exists between the zirconia carrier and deposited
ceria, which makes the system similar to chemically mixed
oxides. The CeO2–ZrO2 system displays better redox properties
than that of ZrO2, due to the generation of a high concentration
of defect sites on the zirconia surface and the ability to generate
O-vacancies. The availability of our CeO2–ZrO2 system for
redox processes at moderate temperature makes these materials
very attractive as carriers for catalysts requiring a highly
efﬁcient redox couple Ce4+/Ce3+.
