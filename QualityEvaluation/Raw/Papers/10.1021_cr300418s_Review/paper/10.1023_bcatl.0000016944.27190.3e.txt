Abstract
Various metal-doped (Fe, V, Zr, Mg) titanium oxides were prepared by an acid-catalyzed sol–gel method and their properties as catalysts were investigated for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the presence of carbon dioxide. The characterization techniques, XRD, BET, TGA were employed to analyze the features of catalyst. Fe3Ti catalyst was found to be quite effective among the catalysts tested at 823 K, 39.8% ethylbenzene conversion and 98% styrene selectivity were acquired.
