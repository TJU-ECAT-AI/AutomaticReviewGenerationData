Abstract
Various La2O3-based catalysts are well-known to be useful for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM reaction). We examined the catalytic activities of various La2O3-based OCM catalysts for the OCM reaction in the kinetic region (i.e., lower O2 conversion). Our investigation revealed that the Fe-doped La2O3 catalyst is a good candidate for the OCM reaction. The La/Fe ratio of the Fe-doped La2O3 catalyst is an important factor for OCM activity. Especially, the O2-based C2 yield of the Fe-doped La2O3 catalyst was higher than that of La2O3 in the case of La/Fe > 5. The Fe-doped La2O3 catalyst modified with Na2O and Na4P2O7 showed high C2 selectivity (83%). Moreover, modification with Bi compounds also enhanced C2 selectivity of the Fe-doped La2O3 catalyst. This catalyst showed higher C2 yield than the Fe-doped La2O3 catalyst.

1 Introduction
Natural gas is important as an energy source and a chemical source. Although conversion technologies, such as GTL and methanol synthesis, have been considered, they have low energy efficiency and complex processing. From the perspective of effective use of natural gas, oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) has received considerable attention for producing C2 hydrocarbons (especially ethylene) directly. (1, 2) Although the OCM reaction is attractive, C2 yields (methane conversion × C2 selectivity) greater than 30%, which are industrially required, have not been accomplished yet. Therefore, further investigation for an active/selective catalyst for the OCM reaction is required.
The OCM reaction has been studied for the last 3 decades. Control of oxidation of methane and C2 hydrocarbons is the most important aspect of the OCM reaction. The active oxygen species for catalytic OCM are O−, O22−, and O2− on the oxide catalyst. These oxygen species activate methane, and the activated methane couples to C2 hydrocarbon. Lunsford considered O− of the [Li+O−] center on Li/MgO as the active site. (3-5) Choudhary suggested that basic O2− is the active center. (6) Furthermore, it was widely accepted that the C−H bond of methane is dissociated on the active oxygen species and that CH3 is generated. Then, the CH3 couples to form ethane, with subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation into ethylene. (7)
To date, various oxide catalysts have been researched. Basic oxides, such as alkali metal oxides, alkali earth metal oxides, and rare earth oxides, show high C2 selectivity in the OCM reaction; especially, La2O3 is well-known to be an effective catalyst. (8-20) Borchert suggested that the oxygen anion vacancies of La2O3 doped with Sr2+ favor the adsorption of gaseous oxygen and its subsequent transformation into lattice oxygen. Consequently, nonselective surface reactions of methyl species and C2 hydrocarbons with weakly adsorbed oxygen are suppressed. (13)Furthermore, Yamashita investigated O22− and O− on the Ba−La−O catalyst, which exhibited 18% C2 yield. (14) Furthermore, perovskite oxide (ABO3) is known to have oxide ion conductivity and that its conductivity can influence the oxidation of methane. Hayakawa investigated the reactivity of LaCoO3-based perovskite oxides and suggested that the formation of hypervalent metal ions, such as Co4+, and disordering of lattice oxygen play important roles in the OCM reaction. (15)
Lattice oxygen anion on the perovskite oxides can be translated to the active sites for the OCM reaction. Therefore, we examined several perovskite oxides: LaFeO3, LaFe0.9Co0.1O3, LaFe0.9Mn0.1O3, LaFe0.9Cr0.1O3, LaFe0.9V0.1O3, LaFe0.9Mo0.1O3, and LaFe0.9W0.1O3. However, these catalysts showed low OCM activity.
In this study, we particularly addressed La2O3, which is known as an effective catalyst for the OCM reaction, and examined modification of La2O3 with many compounds. We attempted to develop an effective La2O3-based OCM catalyst.
2 Experimental Section
2.1 Preparation of Catalyst
Catalysts were prepared as follows using the citric acid method. Precursors, such as La(NO3)3·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, and several nitrates, were dissolved into water followed by adding the aqueous solution of ethylene glycol and citric acid. After heating at 353 K in a water bath, the solution was evaporated completely using a hot stirrer. Then, the obtained complex was decomposed by heat treatment at 673 K for 2 h and subsequent calcination at 1123 K for 10 h. It was then pressed and crushed into particles to obtain the 355−500 μm particle size.
2.2 Catalytic Experiments
The OCM reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed reactor. A quartz tube was used as a reactor; 81 mg of catalyst was charged in it with 500 mg of SiC as a diluent. The catalyst in the reactor was heated to the reaction temperature (1023 K) at the rate of 10 K min−1 in a N2 flow. Reactant gases (CH4/O2/N2 = 10:1:30, total flow rate = 410 mL min−1) were introduced into the reactor. The reaction temperature was 1023 K; W/F (CH4 and O2) was 0.3 g of catalyst h mol−1. At the reactor outlet, a cold trap was used to remove water from the effluent gas. The effluent gas was analyzed using gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC−FID) with a Porapak Q packed column after methanation by the Ru catalyst (for analysis of CH4, CO, CO2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8) and gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (GC−TCD) with a molecular sieve 5 A packed column (for analysis of H2, O2, and N2). Typically, >97% of carbon mass balance was achieved. The experiments were conducted in the kinetic region (i.e., high space velocity, low oxygen feed rate, low temperature as 1023 K, and oxygen conversion is less than 80%); therefore, C2 yield was calculated on the basis of the following equation:
(2.2)
2.3 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the catalyst was carried out using a X-ray diffractometer (operating at 40 kV and 20 mA, Cu Kα radiation filtered by nickel, RINT-2000; Rigaku Corp.). The catalyst surface area was measured using the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) method (AUTOSORB-1; Quantachrome Instruments).
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Several Metal-Doped La2O3 Catalysts
First, we examined the activity of La2O3 or perovskite oxides incorporated with La in the A site. Expecting the release of lattice oxygen, we adopted some transition metals as the B site of the La-contained perovskite oxides. Results of reactions over La2O3 and LaBO3 (B = Fe, Co, Mn, Cr, and Ni) are presented in Table 1. La2O3 showed high C2 selectivity of 64.9%. Over LaFeO3, LaCoO3, LaMnO3, and LaCrO3, oxidation to CO2 was the dominant reaction. In addition, over LaNiO3, enormous quantities of carbon were generated on the catalyst. To modify La2O3 with perovskite oxides, which can activate oxygen effectively, we attempted several metal-doped La2O3 for the OCM reaction. Table 2 presents catalytic activities and crystal phases of several metal-doped La2O3 (B/La = 0.2) catalysts. These catalysts showed higher O2 conversion about 80% than the La2O3 catalyst because of its high oxidizing ability. Results showed that C2 selectivity on LaB0.2Ox was higher than that on LaBO3. Particularly, C2 selectivity on LaFe0.2Ox was the highest. Therefore, we considered the Fe-doped La2O3 catalyst as a good candidate for the OCM reaction.

3.2 Fe-Doped La2O3 Catalyst
From these results, LaFexOy oxides, which are a mixed phase of La2O3 and LaFeO3, have a good potential for the OCM reaction because of their high selectivity to C2 derived from La2O3 and high oxidizing activity derived from LaFeO3 perovskite. Therefore, the catalytic activities of Fe-doped La2O3 catalysts were examined at various Fe concentrations. Figure 1 indicates O2 conversion, C2 selectivity, and O2-based C2 yield according to the La/Fe ratio of Fe-doped La2O3. Also, Figure 1 presents specific surface areas of Fe-doped La2O3 and La2O3 catalysts. O2 conversion, CH4 conversion, and C2 selectivity are 85.7, 7.1, and 38.5% at La/Fe = 5 (LaFe0.2Ox), respectively. Then, they are 69.5, 9.8, and 53.3% at La/Fe = 20 (LaFe0.05Ox), respectively. The C2 selectivity and O2-based C2 yield improved with the La concentration. Especially, the O2-based C2 yield of Fe-doped La2O3 was higher than that of La2O3 in the case of La/Fe > 5. Furthermore, from Figure 1, LaFeO3 and La2O3 had specific surface areas of 3.5 and 0.9 m2 g−1, respectively; those specific surface areas of Fe-doped La2O3 catalysts declined concomitantly with the La concentration. It was surmised that the decline of O2 conversion with the La concentration was attributed to the decrease of the specific surface area and LaFeO3 phase, which activated oxygen effectively, and that the improvement of C2 selectivity with the La concentration resulted from the increased La2O3 phase, which was associated with the generation of C2 compounds. Therefore, LaFeO3 perovskite plays a very important role in improving the oxygen conversion, and the La2O3 phase plays an important role in increasing C2 selectivity. Considering the role of these two oxides, we assumed that the LaFexOy catalysts, which have a La/Fe ratio of 10−20 are good for the OCM reaction.

3.3 Nature of LaFexOy Catalysts
Next, we examined the characteristics of Fe-doped La2O3 (LaFexOy) catalysts in detail. Figure 2 depicts XRD spectra of LaFeO3, LaFe0.5Ox, and LaFe0.05Ox. As shown in Figure 2, only the LaFeO3 perovskite phase was detected at La/Fe = 1 (LaFeO3) and La2O3 was the main component at La/Fe = 20 (LaFe0.05Ox). The LaFeO3 perovskite phase decreased, and the La2O3 phase increased with an increasing La/Fe ratio. Furthermore, Figure 3 shows the catalytic activity of LaFe0.05Ox. LaFe0.05Ox had stable O2 conversion of about 90%, CH4 conversion of about 10%, and C2 selectivity of about 50%. It was inferred that Fe-doped La2O3 catalysts had a stable structure under reaction conditions. Therefore, on the basis of this catalyst, we developed a more efficient catalyst for the OCM reaction by impregnating or doping some other compounds/elements onto or into the LaFe0.05Ox catalysts.

3.4 Modification by Impregnating Some Compounds on LaFexOy Catalysts
Next, to enhance C2 selectivity, we impregnated many oxide compounds, such as Na2O3, Y2O3, ZrO2, WO3, and ZnO on Fe-doped La2O3 (for results, see the Supporting Information). Among them, impregnation with sodium compounds enhanced the C2 selectivity of Fe-doped La2O3. Sodium is well-known as an active species for the OCM reaction. (3)
Some sodium-compound-impregnated Fe-doped La2O3 catalysts were examined. First, we prepared 5.4 wt % Na2O/LaFe0.05Ox catalyst by the impregnation method from an aqueous solution of NaNO3. Figure 4a shows the catalytic activity of 5.4 wt % Na2O/LaFe0.05Ox catalyst. The C2 selectivity decreased from 77.6 to 67.2%, and O2 conversion increased from 14.3 to 21.7% during 370 min of the OCM reaction. Although 5.4 wt % Na2O/LaFe0.05Ox showed higher initial C2 selectivity of 77.6% than LaFe0.05Ox (50.4%), the selectivity to C2 hydrocarbons decreased with reaction time. Concomitantly, with the decrease of the selectivity to C2 hydrocarbons, oxygen and methane conversion increased. We presumed that this phenomenon resulted from sintering or volatilization of Na compounds on the catalyst.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Catalytic activities of (a) 5.4 wt % Na2O/LaFe0.05Ox, (b) 0.5 wt % Na4P2O7/LaFe0.05Ox, and (c) 0.5 wt % Na4P2O7−5.4 wt % Na2O/LaFe0.05Ox, Reaction conditions: CH4/O2/N2 = 10:1:30, the total flow rate = 410 mL min−1, 1023 K, W/F = 0.3 g h mol−1.
Therefore, to stabilize C2 selectivity of this catalyst, we impregnated Na4P2O7, which has a high melting point (1173 K), onto the LaFe0.05Ox catalyst. The activity and selectivity to products are shown in Figure 4b. Although the activity was less compared to Na2O-supported catalyst, this catalyst exhibited stable C2 selectivity of about 55% during 370 min of the reaction. Therefore, we impregnated Na4P2O7 onto Na2O/LaFe0.05Ox catalyst by co-impregnation to obtain a higher yield of C2 hydrocarbons and more stable catalyst simultaneously. Figure 4c shows the activity and selectivity for 0.5 wt % Na4P2O7−5.4 wt % Na2O/LaFe0.05Ox. This catalyst retained more than 80% C2 selectivity. It was inferred that P2O74− prevented sintering of Na compounds or retained it on the catalyst.
3.5 Modification by Doping Some Elements in LaFexOyCatalysts
We doped many compounds, such as In, Cu, W, Zn, Ce, and Bi, into Fe-doped La2O3 (for results, see the Supporting Information). Among them, modification with Bi enhanced the OCM activity of Fe-doped La2O3. (16) Figure 5 depicts the catalytic activity of LaBi0.025Fe0.05Ox catalyst. The O2 conversion, CH4 conversion, and C2 selectivity of this catalyst were 24.1, 1.4, and 54.8%, respectively, at the initial period of the reaction, and conversions increased and reached stable value with reaction time. At 490 min of the time course, the O2 conversion, CH4 conversion, and C2 selectivity on LaBi0.025Fe0.05Ox were about 75, 9.2, and 60%, respectively. These values are higher than those of LaFe0.05Ox (Figure 1). Figure 6 portrays XRD spectra before and after the reaction for the LaBi0.025Fe0.05Ox catalyst. The LaBi0.025Fe0.05Ox catalyst consisted of the LaFeO3 perovskite phase and the La2O3 phase. We were unable to detect any Bi compounds in fresh or after reaction XRD spectra of the catalyst because of its low loading amount; no peak shift was observed. The LaBi0.025Fe0.05Ox catalyst is presumed to be composed of La2O3, LaFeO3, and a trace amount of Bi2O3, which enhanced C2 selectivity of the catalyst.

4 Conclusion
For this study, many La2O3-based catalysts were examined for the OCM reaction. Among several metal-doped La2O3 catalysts, the Fe-doped La2O3 catalyst showed high OCM activity. The La/Fe ratio of the Fe-doped La2O3 catalyst was an important factor for OCM activity. Especially, the O2-based C2 yield of the Fe-doped La2O3 catalyst was higher than that of La2O3 in the case of La/Fe > 5. We modified Fe-doped La2O3 with various compounds to improve the OCM activity. The Fe-doped La2O3 catalyst modified with Na2O and Na4P2O7 showed high C2 selectivity (76%). In addition, modification with Bi compounds enhanced both the C2 selectivity and O2 conversion of Fe-doped La2O3, and the catalyst showed a higher yield of C2 hydrocarbons compared to LaFeO3 and LaFe0.05Ox catalysts.
