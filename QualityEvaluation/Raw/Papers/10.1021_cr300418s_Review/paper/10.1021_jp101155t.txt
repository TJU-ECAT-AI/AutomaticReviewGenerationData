Abstract
Understanding and quantifying the principles governing surface-to-adsorbate charge transfer is of utmost importance because excess electrons in n-type oxides alter significantly surface binding and reactivity. We performed a systematic study using density functional theory (DFT) of the role of excess electrons in rutile TiO2, which can result from point defects such as oxygen vacancies, bridging row hydroxyls, and interstitial Ti species. These defects create excess electrons within the Ti sublattice which can perform redox chemistry on adsorbates. We show the similarity of these defects in their ability to donate electrons to surface adsorbates, indicating that experimentally distinguishing the nature of the defects may be difficult. We examined the adsorption and reactivity of O2 in detail and also present a generalization of these findings for a variety of species. A characterization of the redox properties of the surface/adsorbate complex indicates that when the electronegativity of the adsorbate is greater than the surface electronegativity, significant charge transfer from the reduced surface to the absorbate occurs. Surface defects do not participate in significant charge transfer for adsorbates with low electronegativity. Through variations of the U parameter in the DFT+U theory we modulated the position of the defect states in the band gap. Increased stability of the defect states leads to more difficult charge transfer to the adsorbates and a decrease in the adsorption energy. The present study offers insights on requirements with regard to modeling reduced TiO2 using electronic structure methods and an understanding of how to control the surface reactivity through degree of reduction or defect state location.

I Introduction
TiO2 is a model reducible oxide wherein the creation of point defects, such as O vacancies (Ov), leads to reduction of Ti4+ cations to form Ti3+ sites; i.e., O2− + 2Ti4+ → 1/2O2 + Ov + 2Ti3+. Due to their unsaturated coordination these defect sites are often very reactive. For example, filling of an O vacancy by O2 (1) or H2O (2, 3) is a facile process. Besides producing reactive sites, defects can also donate excess unpaired electrons to the lattice, and these electrons can participate in surface chemistry. It is known, for instance, that O2 is a common electron scavenger over TiO2, (4, 5) meaning that it can take up available electrons from TiO2. Recent experimental work (6) showed that O2 can dissociate at surface five-coordinated Ti sites (Ti5c) on reduced surfaces without direct interaction of O2 with Ov’s. The presence of excess electrons can also change reaction pathways significantly, for example as seen in the reaction of O2 with surface hydroxyls (4, 7-9) and the adsorption of Au clusters. (10, 11) The role of electrons in the photochemistry of TiO2 is well-known and discussed in several reviews. (1, 5, 12, 13) Our recent work (14, 15) showed that migration of electrons is very facile within TiO2. In the present work we examine through density functional theory (DFT) calculations how point defects with their accompanying unpaired excess electrons can affect surface adsorption and reactivity of key adsorbates such as O2 or H2O on TiO2. We then present a rationalization of the findings through the characterization of the redox properties of the surface and adsorbate by considering their relative electronic chemical potentials, i.e., electronegativities. This rationalization can help in anticipating when redox processes may be important in adsorbate−surface interactions.
There have been a number of experimental (2, 3, 6-8, 16-19) and theoretical studies (20-25) focusing on the characterization of defects in TiO2. Much of the theoretical work (21) has focused on Ov’s, but recent work has suggested that Ti interstitials (Tiint) are key defects in reduced samples. (6, 10) This issue is still not experimentally settled, and other more recent work suggests that hydroxyls and Ov’s, rather than Ti interstitials, are the major electron-donating defects. (18, 26) The “ionosorption model” long used by the gas sensing community postulates that charge transfers from semiconducting metal oxides to adsorbed species, forming adsorbed ions. However, in a recent review this model has been criticized for lack of experimental evidence. (27) Hence, a better understanding of the defects’ role and their accompanying electrons in surface processes is warranted. We recently proposed that unpaired electrons near hydroxyls occupy a distribution of near-surface sites and can readily migrate to surface-adsorbed molecules. (24) The interactions of bridging hydroxyls (HOb), Ov’s, and Tiint’s with adsorbates have also received some attention using theoretical methods, (6, 7, 17, 28) but the effects of excess electrons resulting from defects on surface chemistry has not been systematically investigated. In the current work we considered surfaces with Ov’s, HOb’s, and Tiint’s and show that the point defects all behave very similarly by providing excess electrons which can participate in surface chemical processes and modify adsorption energies of electron-accepting species. We also show that the number of excess electrons has a strong energetic effect on adsorption. There have been a number of studies that have ignored the full effect of excess electrons (e.g., peroxide formation (7-9)), and we show in the present work that not accounting for excess electrons may lead to incorrect conclusions. Hence, our work represents a significant step in characterizing the role of excess electrons in the surface chemistry of TiO2.
The paper is organized as follows: in section II we describe the computational methodology; in section III we present and discuss the results. Our conclusions are given in section IV.
II Methodology
All calculations were performed with the CP2K (29-31) package using a slab model for the rutile TiO2 (110) surface. The majority of calculations were at the spin polarized gradient corrected density functional theory (DFT) (32) level, a standard electronic structure method, while a subset (discussed below) was at the DFT+U (33) level, with U applied to the Ti 3d electrons. Core electrons were treated by Goedecker−Teter−Hutter pseudopotentials. (34) For better accuracy, (35) we employed a small-core pseudopotential on Ti (with the 3s and 3p electrons in the valence space) to model the reduced TiO2 systems. The valence electrons were expanded over a double-ζ Gaussian basis set and an auxiliary planewave basis set with an energy cutoff of 300 Ry. All calculations were performed using Γ-point sampling. Charge analysis was performed using the Bader atom-in-molecule approach. (36, 37)
The relevant defect features are shown in Figure 1, as well as the bridging row oxygens (Ob) and the five-coordinate Ti’s (Ti5c). We used both (6 × 2) and (4 × 2) rutile TiO2(110) surface slabs that were between four to six O−Ti−O trilayers thick (12−16 atomic layers thick), where only the bottom layer was kept fixed to the bulk lattice positions and all other degrees of freedom we allowed to relax. We also investigated a variety of large surface slabs so that defect coverages (such as Ov) could approach experimentally relevant coverages (∼0.1). The conclusions did not change whether we used (6 × 2) or (4 × 2) surfaces or whether we used four-, five-, or six-layer slabs, indicating that the slabs were sufficiently large and the results appear converged with respect to cell size. The thicker slabs were used to model surface reactions with subsurface defects (Tiint or bulk Ov) and when applying DFT+U. Adsorption energy is defined using the standard thermodynamic scale,
such that more stable molecules have lower (more negative) adsorption energies.

The notable surface sites are the bridging row O atoms (Ob) and the five-coordinated Ti sites (Ti5c). Also shown are defects that lead to surface reduction: O vacancies (Ov), surface hydroxyls (HOb), and interstitial Ti atoms (Tiint).
The activation energy for H transfer between O−Ti5c (via a symmetric structure with H between two O−Ti5c) was calculated by the constrained optimization method.
We modeled O2 adsorption over reduced surfaces (with HOb’s, Ov’s, or Tiint’s), O2 reactions with surface HOb’s, and various other adsorbates over surfaces with Ov’s. For all the adsorbates we modeled adsorption over positively charged Ti5c atoms, which are key reaction sites, and thus our results are likely to be extendable to other surfaces where adsorbate−cation binding occurs. For the O2 adsorption work, the Ov’s and HOb’s were all directly located on the surface, while the Ti interstitials were located in the first subsurface layer. We varied the defect location when modeling the reaction of HOOad or HOad/Oad formation. The exact location of the defect relative to the adsorbates had little effect on the surface chemistry (discussed further below). See for example Figure 4 which shows the small dependence of the adsorption energy and the O2 charge on the Ov−O2 distance. Table 1 also illustrates that surface Ov’s and bulk Ov’s give similar reaction energies, and the depth of the Tiint (first or fourth subsurface layer) has only a small effect on the preferred products.

III Results and Discussion
A Electron-Donating Ability of Surface Defects
We first modeled the adsorption of O2, a common adsorbate and representative model molecule, on rutile TiO2 (110) surfaces with the three defect types at various concentrations. Interactions between O2 and reduced TiO2 have already been the subject of several recent studies. (6, 16, 18, 38, 39) In these studies, the source of electrons involved in O2 adsorption is not fully resolved. (6, 18) Previous theoretical work already predicted increased binding of O2 to Ti5c sites in the presence of Ov’s (40, 41) while experiment indicated that O2 does not bind to stoichiometric surfaces except at low temperatures. (42, 43) The present results related to O2 adsorption are in accord with the findings of Chrétien and Metiu (ref 11), and they go beyond that work by quantitatively comparing several point defects (e.g. Ti interstitials).
O2 Binding as a Function of the Number of Excess Electrons
We modeled the binding of O2 to one Ti5c, as shown in Figure 2, which shows the most stable adsorption mode for O2. We found other stable adsorption geometries, such as O2 in a bidentate configuration (coordinated to two Ti5c atoms) or O2 oriented along the Ti5c rows (as opposed to rotated), but all were less stable than the structure in Figure 2. The adsorption energies and O2 charges over various surfaces are summarized in Figure 3.

Figure 3
Figure 3. Comparison of charge and adsorption energy for O2 molecularly adsorbed at one Ti5c site (see Figure 2) on various reduced surfaces with defects. Shown are the adsorption energies and Bader charges of O2 over surfaces with (a) Ov’s, (b) HOb’s, and (c) Tiint’s.
Figure 3 shows that there is a strong correlation between the Bader charges of O2 and its adsorption energy: larger charges on O2 are seen for more stable adsorbed O2. Unpaired electrons provided by the defects transfer to the O2 π* orbitals and increase the electrostatic interaction between Ti cations and the anionic O2 molecules. This increased electrostatic interaction drives the more exothermic adsorption. Importantly, the defects behave similarly: one Ov, two HOb’s, or one Tiint all provide two electrons per O2. The defects provide electrons to the surface, and these electrons can in turn be donated to O2. All three defects have adsorption energies near −1.8 eV. Bader charge analysis (36, 37) gives Tiint charges of +1.8 (+2.1 for regular Ti atoms) after O2 adsorption, and thus Tiint’s appear to have an oxidation state intermediate between +2 and +3 states, in agreement with other calculations, (10) and can be considered to donate approximately two electrons to O2. Partial filling of the O2 π* orbitals when only one HOb (one excess electron) per O2 is present leads to only a fractional increase in the binding of O2. Once the O2 π* orbitals are filled, more defects (excess electrons) have no effect on O2 adsorption, as can be seen with two Ov’s, three or more HOb’s, and two Tiint’s. These results agree very well with recent experimental work (18) which showed that the amount of adsorbed O2 is in proportion to the concentration of surface HOb’s and Ov’s and that two HOb’s adsorb the same amount as one Ov. Our results support the idea that the three defects all donate electrons in a similar manner and lead to similar surface reduction states. This suggests that the same redox chemistry can be generated independently of the source of excess electrons.
O2 Binding as a Function of the Location of the Defects
We also considered the effect of defects on alternate O2 binding scenarios. While an O2 molecule prefers to fill the Ov, the mere presence of charged defects stabilizes O2 at Ti5c sites. Of additional interest is the effect of the distance between the O2 and Ov, which is shown in Figure 4. The adsorption energies range from −1.77 to −1.94 eV, and the Bader charges differ by less than 0.03 e−, indicating minimal effect upon charge transfer. For these calculations the O2 molecule was simply placed over Ti5c sites at various distances from the Ov. We found a small preference (0.13 eV) for the Ti5c one site away from the Ov, similar to adsorption of CO near an Ov. (44) Other experimental results show little correlation between the O2 diffusion rate and the O2−Ov distance, (45) which indicates that the distance between the defect and adsorbate has little effect on adsorbate stabilization. As seen in our calculations, this arises as a result of the observation that a primary role of the defect is to donate electrons to the TiO2 lattice in the form of excess electrons which in turn are transferred to the surface bound adsorbate. The mere presence of an Ov or other defects indeed stabilizes O2 at Ti5c sites. We also modeled the dissociation of O2 to form a pair of adsorbed O atoms (Oa) and the results (46) are similar to those for O2: Oa’s are stabilized on the surface by taking up excess unpaired electrons available from defects.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Comparison of O2 adsorption energy versus distance from Ov along the Ti5c row ([11̅0] direction). Calculations were performed with a (6 × 2) cell with one O2 adsorbed and one surface Ov. A distance of 0 Å indicates the O2 is adsorbed at the Ti5c adjacent to the Ov, while a distance of ∼3.0 Å is at the next Ti5c site, etc.
B Effect of Excess Electrons on Surface Reactivity
To demonstrate how the reduction state of the surface influences the chemical reactivity, we considered the interaction of adsorbed O2 with surface hydroxyls. We recently reported (8) that O2 can react with surface hydroxyls to form a newly identified intermediate peroxy (HOO−Ti5c) species (O2 + HOb + Ti5c → HOO−Ti5c + Ob) which can spontaneously dissociate into a terminal hydroxyl (HO−Ti5c) and oxygen adatom (O−Ti5c) pair (HOO−Ti5c → HO−Ti5c + O−Ti5c). Other authors (7) have suggested that a HO−Ti5c/O−Ti5c pair is more stable than HOO−Ti5c, where it was emphasized that excess electrons are necessary for the HO−Ti5c/O−Ti5c formation and their DFT model incorporated bulk Ov’s within their slab to model these excess electrons. We performed an exhaustive analysis of this reaction and confirmed that HOO−Ti5c is indeed more stable than the HO−Ti5c/O−Ti5c pair over the stoichiometric surface, but the HO−Ti5c/O−Ti5c pair is more stable on reduced surfaces, irrespective of the source of the reducing electrons. A summary of these calculations is shown in Table 1. These results indicate that care must be taken when modeling surface reactions to ensure that experimentally relevant surfaces are used in the simulations and that any reaction model developed from experimental data must also take into account electron-donating centers.
The product geometries (HOO−Ti5c and HO−Ti5c/O−Ti5c) and reaction energies are given in Figure 5 and Table 1. Table 1 demonstrates that reduced surfaces favor the formation of HO−Ti5c/O−Ti5c over HOO−Ti5c. The number of defects/electrons has little effect on the HOO−Ti5c formation energy; only the presence of a defect changes the energy compared to the stoichiometric surface reaction energy. In contrast, more defects lead to increased reaction energy for HO−Ti5c/O−Ti5c. This behavior is similar to what has already been observed in our work for O2 adsorption. When considering how general these observations are, we note that the stability of the adsorbates correlates to their electron affinity: HO (1.8 eV (47)), O (1.5 eV (48)), HOO (1.1 eV (49)), and O2 (0.5 eV (50)). While electron affinity is useful when comparing the stability of different adsorbates, it is not sufficient to predict when charge transfer will occur, if at all. Thus, there is a need to obtain a broader understanding of the factors that affect the charge donation from reduced surfaces to adsorbates. This is the subject of the next section.

Before reporting on this point, we were also interested in quantifying the activation energy for H transfer from HO−Ti5c to O−Ti5c in an HOa/Oa pair and how it might be affected by the presence of defects and their associated excess electrons compared to stoichiometric conditions. Our calculations yielded a low activation energy, between 0.1 and 0.2 eV, on both stoichiometric and reduced surfaces. While excess electrons lead to the HOa/Oa pair as a substantially more stable product of the reaction of O2 with HOb over an HO2 product, the activation barrier for the proton to transfer between HOa and Oa is essentially not affected by the number of excess electrons. It is always small, be it on stoichiometric or defected surfaces.
C Electron Transfer and Adsorbate Electronegativity
To understand in a simple way when excess electrons can influence surface reactivity, we considered the relative electronegativity of the surface and adsorbate as possible key parameters to understand charge transfer between surface and adsorbate. Electronegativity is well-defined in the context of DFT as the change in energy of a system as the number of electrons is varied and thus is an electronic chemical potential. It provides a first estimate for knowing when charge transfer between two isolated subsystems can occur when they are brought into contact. According to the Sanderson principle of electronegativity equalization, (51) electrons flow from less electronegative species to more electronegative species and the electronegativity difference provides an approximate estimate of the strength of a polar covalent interaction. The absolute (Mulliken) electronegativity is defined as χ = (I + EA)/2, where I is the ionization potential and EA is the electron affinity of the species. Figure 6 shows the differences in adsorption energies for a variety of species between surfaces with an Ov and stoichiometric surfaces (ΔEads = Eads-Ov − Eads-clean). Ov-defected surfaces of course have excess electrons to transfer to the absorbate. Small values of ΔEads are indicative of adsorbate binding not being affected by charge transfer arising from the presence of excess electrons. Large negative values of ΔEads are indicative of a strong effect of excess electrons on adsorbate binding energies due to enhanced charge transfer. The gains in binding energy resulting from excess electrons are plotted against the electronegativity of the adsorbate in Figure 6c. It can be seen that, for adsorbates with electronegativities lower than ∼4.5−6 eV (e.g., H2O), the effect of an Ov is negligible, while for adsorbates with larger electronegativies the effect of excess electrons can be considerable.
Figure 6
Figure 6. Illustration of the effect of electronegativity on adsorption energies. In a, the electronegativity of the adsorbate (χadsorbate) is larger than the electronegativity of TiO2 (χTiO2) so that electron transfer to the adsorbate occurs. In b, no electron transfer occurs because χadsorbate < χTiO2. In c is shown the relationship between χadsorbate and the calculated difference in adsorption energy between the reduced (one Ov present) and clean surface (ΔEads = Eads-Ov − Eads-clean). A ΔEads value of 0 eV would indicate that the stoichiometric and reduced surfaces have equivalent adsorption energies, while a negative ΔEads value indicates adsorption is stronger on the reduced surface. The transition region between the case in a and that in b is indicated in the plot. Electronegativity values were taken from Pearson (63) with the exception of F2 and NO, which were calculated from I and EA values. (64-67)
The separation between the two regimes of stabilization of adsorbates by excess electrons from an Ov is not a sharp delineation. This can be understood by the fact that electronegativity differences provide only an approximate measure of charge transfer and the strength of polar covalent interactions and second-order effects related to the absolute hardness of the species are expected to come into play for systems where the relative electronegativites are close, as exemplified by NO, CO, and Au. In addition, charge transfer to adsorbates leads to increased Coulombic interaction between the surface and the charged adsorbate, as well as surface/adsorbate geometric relaxation; both may strengthen the adsorption energy and lead to deviations from this simple argument. Nevertheless the existence of the two approximate regimes can be seen. Species with low electronegativity (<4.5 eV) do not show substantial stabilization due to surface−adsorbate charge transfer, whereas those with high electronegativity (<6.0 eV) do. Our findings strongly suggest circumstances when charge transfer is likely to occur for species over Ti5c sites (major reactive sites of TiO2) and to some extent the magnitude of the strengthening of the binding energy in these cases. We expect similar results over a variety of TiO2 surfaces, as well as phases, when adsorbates interact with surface Ti cations. Indeed experimental work (52) involving a mixed TiO2−SiO2 catalyst showed that charge transfer occurred with adsorbed electrophilic molecules, while charge transfer did not occur with a less electrophilic molecule. It was later surmised that similar results would be seen for TiO2 (53) and that the adsorbate electronegativity would suggest when charge transfer would occur. Our work confirms this hypothesis.
In a real TiO2 crystal there are a number of occupied and unoccupied gap states due to lattice defects which pin the Fermi level to the center of the gap. (54) Some of the gap states may be occupied, and removing an electron from an occupied gap state has an energy which is equal to I. The workfunction,WTiO2, is the energy required to remove an electron from the lattice to vacuum, and is thus equivalent to I. Adding an electron to an unoccupied gap state has an energy equal to EA. The gap states are close in energy, or I ≈ EA, leading to the relationship χTiO2 ≈ WTiO2. Experimental values for WTiO2 of a (110) surface can range from 5.8 to 4.4 eV depending on the degree of reduction. (55) The experimental WTiO2 range agrees very nicely with the electronegativity range in Figure 6c, validating this model, namely, that charge transfer occurs when the adsorbate’s electronegativity is greater than the TiO2 electronegativity.
D Relationship between Defect States and Electron Transfer
In this subsection we probe how the character of excess electrons in localized gap states can influence surface redox chemistry. We first digress and note that due to the fact that we have employed standard DFT (a generalized gradient approximation functional), the excess electrons associated with defects tend to delocalize at the bottom of conduction band (56) in contrast with experimental observations where the electrons localize ∼1 eV below the conduction band in a polaronic state. (54, 57) This is a well-known DFT weakness originating in the functionals of the density that have been developed for application of the theory. (21, 24, 56, 58) Despite these shortcomings, studies involving DFT are common and are widely accepted as providing useful information about chemical processes, as indicated by a number of papers (6, 7, 9, 10, 59-61) studying surface reactivity or adsorption over reduced TiO2 using DFT. DFT is able to capture the essential features of adsorbates over reduced surfaces, in spite of the delocalization problem. In our case the same thermodynamic end point (i.e., charge transfer to electronegative molecules) occurs regardless of where the electrons come from or the degree of localization. Interestingly, a recent paper (25) showed the energies from localized and delocalized states using DFT+U to be often nearly degenerate, further validating the use of DFT.
For our current purposes we wish to understand how the surface redox chemistry depends upon the work function of a rutile TiO2 (110) surface by artificially modifying the energy of the gap states. By clarifying this relationship, we can obtain additional insight into the surface redox processes even if the actual quantitative prediction of binding energies is limited by our current electronic structure method. This was achieved by controlling the defect state energy in an ad hoc manner. using DFT+U, (33) a popular approach to increase on-site electron localization. DFT+U employs a biasing potential (controlled by the magnitude of the U parameter) to increase the self-attraction of electrons, and hence stabilizes and localizes electrons at Ti sites in the TiO2 lattice. Consequently DFT+U can correctly provide localized electronic states for the excess electrons in TiO2 which exist as mobile polarons in the lattice. (14, 24) At a low (or no) U value the defect states are not well stabilized and hence lie at the bottom of the conduction band. Increasing the U value pushes the defect states lower in energy relative to the bottom of the conduction band (i.e., into the band gap as in the real crystal) until finally at high U values the defect states lie at the top of the valence band. The correlation between the defect state energy and the U value has been established by several researchers. (24, 58, 62) We show in Figure 7 a sample density of states plot for a surface with a single hydroxyl: as shown the defect state is in the middle of the gap. We also refer the reader to our recent work (24) (see for example Figure S1 in the Supporting Information of ref 24) which further discusses this relationship between U value and location of the defect state within the gap, as well as the Supporting Information of the current work. On the one hand, this observation means that one is not able to definitively assign the gap state energy of the defect states by DFT+U (since U is an adjustable parameter). On the other hand, this behavior provides us with a route whereby we can systematically vary the gap state energy, by adjusting U, and see how this affects the surface redox properties.
Figure 7
Figure 7. Sample density of states (DOS) plot for a surface with single hydroxyl at U = 2.2 eV. The inset shows the region near the band gap with a defect-induced gap state. The 0 eV on the energy scale corresponds to the valence band edge. A five-layer slab was used for this calculation.
Since the work function of TiO2 determines when redox chemistry can take place, manipulating WTiO2 can be a way to control surface chemistry. As mentioned, the location of defect states determines WTiO2 and lowering the defect state energy increases WTiO2, and hence χTiO2. We tested this idea by simulating the adsorption of O2 over defective surfaces at different U values. Higher U values give defect states with lower gap energies, or more tightly bound electrons, while lower U values give less bound electrons. U values between 3 and 5 eV are typical, as shown by previous studies. (58, 62) Our results (given in Figure 8) indicate that increasing the U value, i.e., lowering the defect state energy, decreases the adsorption energy of O2, until, at high U values, χTiO2 is too large and charge transfer to O2 is considerably hindered and stable adsorption does not occur. This observation is consistent with the role of electronegativity determining the degree of surface-to-adsorbate charge transfer and shows how changing WTiO2 can be used to control surface chemistry.

Finally, for these DFT+U calculations the unpaired electrons could be localized at various Ti locations in the lattice. Among these locations several of them displayed close energy as localized sites for one excess electron. See our recent work on HOb’s. (24) Similar findings were found for two excess electrons originating from one Ov’s. We also refer to recent work (25) that showed several localized and delocalized solutions to be close in energy. This suggests that finding the ground state for reduced systems is difficult. Thus, we believe that the location of the unpaired electrons has a small effect on the initial state energies of the surface, and hence small effect on the adsorption and reaction energies. The final state occurs (with the electron charge transferred to the adsorbate) regardless of the initial state. In other words, our conclusions about the thermodynamics of surface-to-adsorbate charge transfer do not change when different defect states, i.e., different electronic wave functions, occur.
IV Conclusions
We have shown that there is a semiquantitative correlation between the number of defects/excess electrons and the strength of adsorption at Ti5c sites. One cannot therefore ignore the role of these electrons or assume that merely the presence of defects/electrons gives a satisfactory model of the TiO2 surface. We have also shown that three common defects behave similarly; they all give up electrons to the TiO2 lattice which in turn can transfer electron charge to surface adsorbates. The resulting picture provides a solid underpinning for the appropriateness of an ionosorption model for understanding surface/adsorbate redox processes on reduced TiO2 surfaces. In addition these results provide ideas on how to properly model the effects of charged defects upon adsorption. Our work also shows that significant charge transfer occurs only for species with large electronegativity. Finally we have shown how the location of the defect state (corresponding to the TiO2 work function) determines the strength of the charge transfer to the adsorbate molecule. Strong modifications of the surface work function can change the reactivity of some species and tailor the chemistry of the surface. These conclusions may aid in the design and synthesis of future TiO2 catalyst materials. Our observations may also be applicable to other oxide materials, and this will be the subject of future research.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. Structure of the rutile (110) surface. Red spheres represent O atoms, gray spheres represent Ti atoms, and white spheres represent H atoms. The notable surface sites are the bridging row O atoms (Ob) and the five-coordinated Ti sites (Ti5c). Also shown are defects that lead to surface reduction: O vacancies (Ov), surface hydroxyls (HOb), and interstitial Ti atoms (Tiint).
Figure 2
Figure 2. O2 adsorption geometry for the most stable adsorption mode: (a) side and (b) top views.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Comparison of charge and adsorption energy for O2 molecularly adsorbed at one Ti5c site (see Figure 2) on various reduced surfaces with defects. Shown are the adsorption energies and Bader charges of O2 over surfaces with (a) Ov’s, (b) HOb’s, and (c) Tiint’s.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Comparison of O2 adsorption energy versus distance from Ov along the Ti5c row ([11̅0] direction). Calculations were performed with a (6 × 2) cell with one O2 adsorbed and one surface Ov. A distance of 0 Å indicates the O2 is adsorbed at the Ti5c adjacent to the Ov, while a distance of ∼3.0 Å is at the next Ti5c site, etc.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Adsorption modes of (a) HOO−Ti5c and (b) HO−Ti5c/O−Ti5c after reaction of O2 with a surface hydroxyl: (a) O2 + HOb + Ti5c → HOO−Ti5c + Ob or (b) O2 + HOb + 2Ti5c → HO−Ti5c + O−Ti5c.
Figure 6
Figure 6. Illustration of the effect of electronegativity on adsorption energies. In a, the electronegativity of the adsorbate (χadsorbate) is larger than the electronegativity of TiO2 (χTiO2) so that electron transfer to the adsorbate occurs. In b, no electron transfer occurs because χadsorbate < χTiO2. In c is shown the relationship between χadsorbate and the calculated difference in adsorption energy between the reduced (one Ov present) and clean surface (ΔEads = Eads-Ov − Eads-clean). A ΔEads value of 0 eV would indicate that the stoichiometric and reduced surfaces have equivalent adsorption energies, while a negative ΔEads value indicates adsorption is stronger on the reduced surface. The transition region between the case in a and that in b is indicated in the plot. Electronegativity values were taken from Pearson (63) with the exception of F2 and NO, which were calculated from I and EA values. (64-67)
Figure 7
Figure 7. Sample density of states (DOS) plot for a surface with single hydroxyl at U = 2.2 eV. The inset shows the region near the band gap with a defect-induced gap state. The 0 eV on the energy scale corresponds to the valence band edge. A five-layer slab was used for this calculation.
Figure 8
Figure 8. Effect of DFT+U on the adsorption energy of a single O2 molecule over clean and reduced surfaces. Shown are results over (a) surfaces with Ov’s, (b) hydroxylated surfaces, and (c) surfaces with Tiint’s. A five-layer slab was used for these calculations.
