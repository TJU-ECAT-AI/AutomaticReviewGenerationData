The gas–solid reaction between methane and cerium oxide
(CeO2) directly produced a synthesis gas with H2/CO ratio of 2.
The addition of Pt black remarkably accelerated the formation
rates of H2 and CO and decreased the activation energy for the
production of the synthesis gas. The hydrogen-exchange reaction
between CH4 and CD4 proceeded remarkably faster than the oxi-
dation of methane with CeO2 regardless of the presence or absence
of Pt. Thus, It was suggested that the cleavage of the C–H bond
of methane could not be the rate-determining step. The small ki-
netic isotopic effect (kH/kD = 1.1 ± 0.1) in methane conversion sug-
gested that the step involving hydrogen such as the recombination
or desorption of hydrogen could be the rate-determining step. H2,
CO, and a small amount of CH4 were observed in temperature-
programmed desorption experiments for the chemisorbed species
generated on CeO2 during the reaction with methane. This result
along with the in situ FT-IR spectroscopic results suggested that
the reaction proceeded not through HCHO but probably through
carbon intermediate. CO must be produced by the reaction of the
carbon with the lattice oxygen of CeO2. TPD experiments showed
that the presence of Pt remarkably decreased the temperature for
the desorptions of H2 and CO. The obvious tailing of H2 formation
in the reaction of CeO2 with methane pulse also indicated that the
recombination or desorption of hydrogen was the rate-determining
step. It was suggested that Pt accelerated this step probably through
a reverse spillover mechanism.

INTRODUCTION
The chemical utilization of natural gas, one of the world’s
abundant resources, to produce basic chemicals is one of the
desirable goals in the current chemical industry. However,
because of the chemical inertness of methane, the main con-
stituent of natural gas, the chemical transformation of nat-
ural gas directly into useful chemicals as industrial starting
materials is a great challenge. The conversion of methane
to useful chemicals has attracted much attention in re-
cent years and many methods and technologies have been
reported. Although the direct conversion of methane to
valuable chemicals such as methanol or ethylene is the most

fascinating route, no viable process or catalyst has been
developed (1–3). At present, the indirect transformation
of methane via synthesis gas is still the most competitive
process (4). Generally, methane is converted to synthesis
gas via steam reforming (5). The synthesis gas then serves
as a feedstock of many chemical processes, e.g., Fischer–
Tropsch and methanol syntheses. However, as shown in
Eq. [1],
CH4 + H2O →CO + 3H2,
1H = +49.3 kcal/mol, [1]
because the steam reforming is a highly endothermic re-
action, the reaction has to be operated at high tempera-
ture (>900◦C) and a large amount of energy is consumed
to drive this reaction. Furthermore, for Fischer–Tropsch or
methanol synthesis,
nCO + 2nH2 →CnH2n + nH2O,
[2]
CO + 2H2 →CH3OH,
[3]
the desired H2/CO ratio is 2, thus the H2/CO ratio of syn-
thesis gas obtained from steam reforming must be adjusted
through the reverse shift reaction. By contrast, the partial
oxidation of methane to synthesis gas
CH4 + 1
2O2 →CO + 2H2,
1H = −8.5 kcal/mol,
[4]
is an exothermic reaction and gives a H2/CO ratio of 2. This
reaction may proceed at much moderate temperatures (e.g.,
<500◦C). However, the direct oxidation of methane to syn-
thesis gas is very difﬁcult to achieve (6, 7). Actually, most
of the reports concerning the partial oxidation method in-
volved the complete oxidation of methane to CO2 and H2O
followed by the reforming of the remaining CH4 with H2O
and CO2 (8–15). As a result, a high temperature (>800◦C)
is required to obtain high selectivities of H2 and CO due to
the limitation of thermodynamic equilibrium of the reform-
ingreactionatlowtemperatures.Althoughseveralcatalysts
are active in this partial oxidation of methane, a rapid de-
activation of catalysts seems to be a big problem.
Recently, we tested a novel method for the direct con-
version of CH4 to synthesis gas by gas–solid reactions (16).

METHANE TO SYNTHESIS GAS BY CERIUM OXIDE
153
FIG. 1.
Method for direct conversion of CH4 to synthesis gas using
redox of CeO2.
This method is schematically represented in Fig. 1. CH4
reacts with CeO2 in step 1, producing H2 and CO with a
ratio of 2. The gas product can directly be used for the
Fischer–Tropsch or the methanol synthesis. The reduced
cerium oxide (CeO2−x) can be recovered to CeO2 by the
reaction with CO2 or H2O in step 2, producing pure CO or
H2 simultaneously. Both CO and H2 are industrially nec-
essary chemicals for the carbonylation and hydrogenation
processes, respectively. Equations [5]–[7] summarize the re-
actions occurring in both steps.
step 1
CeO2 + xCH4 →CeO2−x + xCO + 2xH2
[5]
step 2
CeO2−x + xCO2 →CeO2 + xCO
[6]
CeO2−x + xH2O →CeO2 + xH2
[7]
The thermodynamic considerations of the reactions in
Eqs. [5]–[7] are shown in Fig. 2. The oxidation of CH4 by
CeO2 is thermodynamically viable at >600◦C, while the re-
action in step 2 is favorable at <700◦C. Thus the two-step
method described above can overcome the thermodynamic
limitation at ca. 600◦C. In previous papers (16), we have
demonstrated that H2 and CO with a ratio of 2 are se-
lectively produced by the reaction of CH4 with CeO2 at
≥700◦C. The reduced CeO2–x was recovered to CeO2 by
H2O with high efﬁciency in step 2, producing H2 at 400–
600◦C. Compared to the reaction in step 2, the reaction in
step 1, i.e., the reaction between CH4 and CeO2, needed
considerably higher temperatures than 600◦C because of
lower reaction rate. Therefore, in order to increase the efﬁ-
ciency of this two-step method, the reaction in step 1 needs
to be accelerated. The main purpose of this work is to ﬁnd a
suitable catalyst for the acceleration of the rate of reaction
of CH4 with CeO2 and to clarify its catalytic function. The
reaction mechanism for the formation of H2 and CO from
CH4 is also discussed on the bases of kinetic, FT-IR, TPD,
and pulse studies.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
The CeO2 (purity >99.9%) purchased from Wako Chem-
ical Industry Co. was used for the reaction. The BET surface
area determined by N2 adsorption was 6.3 m2/g. Many met-
als and oxides used as catalysts or additives were thoroughly
mixed with CeO2 using an agate mortar for 1 h. The sam-
ples with the amount of the additives of 8 mol% in metal
element basis for oxide additives and of 1 wt% for metal
black additives were selected as representatives in this
paper, because 5 and 25 mol% for the former and 0.5 wt%
for the latter showed similar enhancing or retarding effects
as their essential features of the effects.
Reactions
The gas–solid reaction between CH4 and CeO2 was car-
ried out using a conventional ﬁxed bed quartz reactor
operated at atmospheric pressure. The inner diameter of
the reactor was 8 mm. For a standard reaction, 3.0 g of
CeO2 or of the mixture of CeO2 and catalyst was loaded
in the reactor. The granules with sizes of 20–40 mesh were
used. The length of the CeO2 bed (both with and without
catalyst) was ca. 4 cm. The reactor was set in an electric
furnace ca. 40 cm long and a thermal homogeneous zone of
FIG. 2.

2. The calculation was based on the data in Ref. (20).

ca. 8 cm. The CeO2 with or without catalyst was pretreated
in an O2 ﬂow diluted with Ar (P(O2) = 50.5 kPa, total ﬂow
rate = 120 cm3/min) at 700◦C for 1 h before the reaction.
After the reactor was purged with pure Ar (99.99%, ﬂow
rate = 120 cm3/min) for 1 h, the reaction was started by pass-
ing a CH4 ﬂow diluted with Ar (P(CH4) = 50.5 kPa, total
ﬂow rate = 120 cm3/min). The products were analyzed by a
TCD equipped on-line gas chromatograph with an interval
of ca. 10 min. An active carbon column (3 m) was used for
the analysis of H2, CO, and CH4. H2O and CO2 were simul-
taneously analyzed by a Gaschropak-54 (3 m) column. The
line between the exit of the reactor and gas chromatograph
was heated to 110◦C to prevent the condensation of H2O.
Because CeO2 is the only oxygen source, the degree of re-
duction of CeO2 by CH4 could be evaluated from the total
amount of the oxygen-containing products, i.e., CO, CO2,
and H2O, as follows:
degree of reduction =
[CO] + 2[CO2] + [H2O] (mol)
2[CeO2] (mol)
× 100 (%).
The recovery of the reduced cerium oxide (step 2) af-
ter the reaction with CH4 (step 1) was performed by re-
action with CO2 or H2O. CO2 or H2O gas diluted with
Ar (CO2/Ar = 1/7 or H2O/Ar = 1/40) at a ﬂow rate of
40 cm3/min was introduced to react with CeO2−x after the
reactor was purged with Ar. The recovery of the lattice
oxygen of cerium oxide was calculated on the basis of the
amount of CO or H2 produced as follows:
degree of recovery =
amount of CO or H2 produced in step 2
amount of oxygen removed from CeO2 in step 1 × 100 (%).
FT-IR Measurement
For IR-transmission measurement, CeO2 or Pt-added
CeO2 was pressed into a self-supporting water. The quartz-
made IR cell equipped with two NaCl windows was con-
nected to a closed gas-circulation system linked to a vacuum
line. The sample in the cell could be heated to 1000 K. The
IR experiments were carried out with a Fourier-transform
infrared spectrometer (JASCO FT/IR-7000) equipped with
an MCT detector cooled with liquid nitrogen. All the spec-
tra were recorded after the sample was cooled down to
room temperature with a cooling water pipeline surround-
ing the IR cell.
Temperature-Programmed Desorption
(TPD) Measurement
TPD measurements of the chemisorbed species were per-
formed for CeO2 and Pt-added CeO2 after the contact with
CH4 at 650◦C. After the samples being cooled down to
room temperature, the gas phase was removed by evac-
uation to 10−6 Torr. TPD measurement was then carried
out by increasing the temperature at a rate of 4◦C/min. The
desorbed products were monitored by a quadrupole mass
spectrometer.
CH4–CD4 Exchange Reaction and Isotope Effect
(kH/kD) Measurement
The isotope exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4
and the measurement of the isotope effect (kH/kD) on the
basis of their rates of conversion were carried out using
a closed gas-circulation system made of Pyrex glass. The
CeO2 or Pt-added CeO2 powder was placed in a U-shaped
quartz reactor (i.d. 4 mm) which was inserted in an electric
furnace. The gases were circulated by a circulation pump
during the reaction. The system was connected through
a leak valve to a quadrupole mass spectrometer and to a
gas chromatograph for the analysis of the products from
methane.
Pulse Reaction
Thesameapparatusfortheﬂowreactiondescribedabove
was used for pulse reactions. For the pulse reactions, a CH4
pulse carried with Ar was introduced to the ﬁxed bed re-
actor loaded with CeO2. The exit pulse including products
were directly passed through an active carbon column, and
the responses of the CH4 and the products were recorded
by an on-line gas chromatograph.
RESULTS
Gas–Solid Reaction between CH4 and CeO2
Figure 3 represents typical kinetic curves of the products
in the reaction of CH4 with CeO2 at 700◦C. H2 and CO
were the overwhelming products, although H2O and CO2
were observed at the very early stage of the reaction. The
ratio of H2 and CO was almost kept at 2.0 after 20 min of
reaction. As described earlier, such a syngas with H2/CO
ratio of 2 could directly be used for the Fischer–Tropsch or
the methanol synthesis.
The formation of H2 and CO under the conditions of
Fig. 3 lasted for ca. 400 min. The calculation showed that
the degree of reduction of CeO2 was 21% after the reaction,
comparable to the value (25%) by assuming that CeO2 is
completely reduced to Ce2O3. Such an amount of oxygen
consumed obviously cannot be ascribed to the surface oxy-
gen only, because the amount of oxygen at the ﬁrst surface
layer on the basis of BET surface area (6.3 m2 g−1) corre-
sponds to roughly 5% of the consumed oxygen in step 1.
Therefore, it is clear that the bulk lattice oxygen of CeO2
must participate in the oxidation of CH4.
It should be noted in Fig. 3 that the formation of H2 and
CO continued in the absence of H2O and CO2 in the gas
phase after 30 min. The presence of gaseous H2O and CO2

at the early stage of the reaction did not particularly accel-
erate the formation of H2 and CO. In order to understand
the scheme for the formation of H2 and CO, the reform-
ing reactions of CH4 with CO2 were carried out on CeO2.
The reforming reaction of CH4 with CO2 (initial P(CH4) =
50kPa,P(CO2) = 5kPa,andCeO2 = 1.0g)alwaysproduced
H2O, and the H2/CO ratio never did exceed 1.0 at temper-
atures of 600–800◦C. The reforming reaction of CH4 with
H2O was always accompanied by the formation of CO2 and
never gave the H2/CO ratio of 2. Therefore, we believe that
the H2 and CO in Fig. 3 were not the reforming products but
rather that the products formed directly from the reaction
of CH4 and CeO2.
Carbon deposition during the reaction is an important
aspect in carrying out the reaction smoothly. Thus, we mea-
sured the total amount of carbonaceous species deposited
on cerium oxide after the reaction with CH4. After the re-
action, the reactor was purged with Ar, and then a pure O2
ﬂow (120 cm3/min) was introduced to burn out the carbon
deposited on cerium oxide. The CO and CO2 produced
were quantiﬁed by gas chromatograph and were used to
calculate the amount carbon deposit. Such measurements
were done by stopping the reaction of CH4 with CeO2 at dif-
ferent reaction times and thus at different degrees of CeO2
reduction. As indicated in the previous paper (16), almost
no carbon deposit was observed at a degree of reduction
lower than 10%. However, the carbon deposit increased
sharply when the degree of reduction was increased above
10%. Therefore, we have already claimed that it is better
to keep the degree of reduction below 10% to avoid the
carbon deposit in step 1 and to guarantee the repeated use
of the cerium oxide in steps 1 and 2.
Oxidation of CeO2−x with CO2 and H2O
The reduced cerium oxide (CeO2−x) after the experiment
in Fig. 3 (the degree of reduction was 8%) was purged
with Ar and subjected to the reaction with CO2 or H2O.
Figure 4 shows the formation rates of CO and H2 during the
reactions with CO2 and H2O at 450 and 550◦C, respectively.
Both reactions proceeded smoothly at such temperatures
and ﬁnished after 20 and 40 min, respectively. The calcula-
tions showed that the degrees of recovery of CeO2 reached
82 and 90%, respectively.
Catalyst for the Reaction between CH4 and CeO2
The results described above suggest that the reaction in
step 2 proceeds smoothly and fast as compared with the
reaction in step 1. In order to increase the efﬁciency of this
two-step method, the reaction in step 1, i.e., the reaction be-
tween CH4 and CeO2, should be accelerated. Thus, many
additives were tested for the oxidation of CH4 with CeO2.
The formation rates of H2 and CO (average rates in the ini-
tial 20 min) in the presence of different additives are shown
in Fig. 5. It is known that the addition of alkaline earth
metal oxides such as CaO and SrO results in the forma-
tion of solid solutions with CeO2, generating lattice oxygen

defects (17). The diffusion of lattice oxygen anion could
thus be accelerated. However, the formation rates of both
H2 and CO were not appreciably enhanced by the addi-
tion of these alkaline earth metal oxides as shown in Fig. 5.
Therefore, the diffusion of lattice oxygen might not be a
rate-determining step in the reaction of CH4 with CeO2.
The addition of alkali metal oxides, i.e., Li2O, Na2O, and
K2O remarkably decreased the formation rates of H2 and
CO. On the other hand, the presence of Pt black or Pd black
obviously accelerated the formation of H2 and CO. Figure 5
shows that the formation rate of H2 is highest in the pres-
ence of Pd black. However, the H2/CO ratio obtained was
ca. 6.0, which notably exceeded the stoichiometric ratio of
H2/CO (= 2.0) expected in Eq. [5]. This high H2/CO ratio
indicates the deposit of carbon on Pd-added CeO2. On the
other hand, in the case of Pt, the ratio of H2/CO was 2.05.
Thus, Pt accelerated the stoichiometric reaction of Eq. [5]
without depositing carbon.
The reaction of CH4 with Pt black (30 mg) without CeO2
produced only a small amount of H2 (ca. 1% of that in the
presence of CeO2). The formation of CO was not observed
at all. Therefore, Pt functioned as a catalyst for the reaction
of CH4 with CeO2.
The formation rates of CO at different reaction temper-
atures for both CeO2 and Pt-added CeO2 were measured
previously (16). The formation rate of CO was increased in
the presence of Pt at all the temperatures investigated. It
should be noted that the ratio of H2/CO was always 2.0 ± 0.1
irrespective of the reaction temperature. The apparent acti-
vation energy for the formation of CO was decreased from
160 to 68 kJ/mol due to the presence of Pt. This result
strongly supports the idea that Pt black has a very notable
catalytic function on the formation of CO and H2.
The degrees of reduction of CeO2 after the reaction with
CH4 for 2 h at different temperatures were plotted in Fig. 6.
Pt black enhanced the degrees of reduction of CeO2 at all
the reaction temperatures, and such enhancement became
more notable at lower temperatures. The oxidation of CH4
with CeO2 became notable at ca. 550◦C in the presence of
Pt catalyst, while temperatures ≥650◦C were required when
the catalyst was absent.
In Situ FT-IR Measurement
As described above, it was demonstrated that H2 and CO
with a ratioof 2 could be selectively produced from the gas–
solid reaction of CH4 with CeO2, and this reaction was ac-
celerated by Pt catalyst. The elucidation of the mechanism
for the formation of H2 and CO is important in understand-
ing the role of Pt. One possibility is that H2 and CO may be
formed through intermediates such as absorbed CH3O or
HCHO. Thus, in situ FT-IR measurements have been car-
ried out to investigate the adsorbed species. Figure 7 shows
the spectra obtained after the reaction of CH4 (5.3 kPa)
with Pt-added CeO2 (wafer with a diameter of 3 cm and
a weight of 80 mg) in IR cell at 550◦C for 2 h. The spectra
were recorded within 10 min after the sample was quenched
to room temperature. Difference spectra are shown here,
in which the absorbance arising from the Pt–CeO2 sample
itself is subtracted. No obvious absorption peak is observed
in the region of OH and C–H stretching vibrations (3500–
2500 cm−1), except for the stretching of C–H ascribed to
gaseous CH4 (sharp peak at 3016 cm−1). This indicates that
the species comprising C–H and O–H due to the adsorbed
HCHO and CH3OH or due to their precursors or derivates
may not be formed on the surface of Pt–CeO2 during the
reaction. Furthermore, the absorption bands ascribed to
the stretching of C=
=O in HCHO, which should appear at
1650–1800 cm−1, were not observed as shown in Fig. 7B.
On the other hand, four absorption peaks at 1576, 1296,
1030, and 860 cm−1 were observed, and these peaks could

It is very usual that carbonate species exists on the surface
of cerium oxide because of the basicity of cerium oxide.
However, whether there is a correlation between the car-
bonate species and the formation of CO is unclear at this
moment.
As a conclusion of IR measurements, the absorption
bands which could be assigned to CHx, methoxide (CH3O),
and HCHO species were not observed. Although we can-
not exclude the situation that the lifetime of these species is
too short or the steady-state concentration of these species
is too low to be detected by FT-IR spectroscopy, this result
more likely indicates that the reaction does not proceed
through these intermediates.
TPD Measurement
To obtain further information about the possible reaction
intermediates and to understand the effect of Pt on the
formation of the products, the desorption features of the
chemisorbed species on CeO2 with and without Pt were
investigatedbyTPDmethod.Theexperimentswerecarried
out in the following sequences. Before TPD measurements,
the reaction of CeO2 with CH4 in the presence and absence
of Pt had been performed at 650◦C for 1 h, the reactor was
then cooled down to room temperature within 10 min. The
TPD measurements for the chemisorbed species on CeO2
with and without Pt were then carried out after the gas
phase in the reactor had been removed by evacuation to
ca. 10−6 Torr. The heating rate used for TPD measurement
was 4◦C/min. The products desorbed were monitored by a
mass spectrometer.
The result for CeO2 was shown in Fig. 8A, only the des-
orptions of H2 and CO along with a trace of CH4 were
observed. The desorptions of both H2 and CO occurred al-
most simultaneously and started at ca. 250◦C. The fact that
HCHO was not observed in this experiment supports the
speculation that the reaction does not proceed through a
HCHO intermediate.
The TPD results in the presence of Pt black are shown in
Fig. 8B. In this case, the main desorption products were also
H2 and CO. However, the commencement temperature for
the desorption of both H2 and CO was obviously lowered
due to the presence of Pt black. It should be noted that no
CO was observed and only a very small amount of H2 (<1%
of the total H2 desorbed in Fig. 8B) was desorbed when only
Pt was used. Thus, Pt lowered the temperature for the des-
orption of H2 and CO which had been adsorbed on cerium
oxide. Besides H2 and CO, the desorption of CH4 was also
observed and its amount was increased in the presence of
Pt. The adsorption of CH4 on CeO2 was studied in detail by
Li and Xin using FT-IR spectroscopy (19). They reported
FIG. 8.

158

that CH4 could only be adsorbed on CeO2 at temperatures
lower than −15◦C. Thus, it is unlikely that the CH4 desorbed
at 150–300◦C in Fig. 8 results from the adsorbed CH4 itself
on CeO2. Moreover, since the peak temperature for the des-
orption of CH4 was very close to those of H2 and CO, we
speculate that this CH4 arises through the hydrogenation of
adsorbed carbon species, a probable reaction intermediate.
Thus, it is likely that the adsorbed carbon and hydrogen
atoms may serve as the intermediates for the formation of
H2 and CO.
CH4–CD4 Exchange Reaction
Hydrogen exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 was
carried out to obtain information about the dissociation of
C–HbondofCH4.Figure9showstheresultoftheCH4–CD4
exchange reaction on CeO2 at 650◦C. The reaction was car-
ried out using a closed gas-circulation system. The initial
CH4/CD4 ratio was 12/13. Both CH4 and CD4 concentra-
tions decreased steeply with reaction time at early stage
of the reaction (<10 min). Simultaneously, the hydrogen-
exchanged products, i.e., CH3D, CHD3, and CH2D2, were
formed and their concentrations increased along the reac-
tion time. However, their concentrations did not change
appreciably after 20 min.
A quantitative calculation showed that at least 149 µmol
of methane molecules exchanged their hydrogen and deu-
terium during CH4–CD4 reaction in the ﬁrst 10 min on CeO2
without Pt. However, the amount of methane converted to
CO was only 2 µmol under such reaction conditions. This
result means that the CH4–CD4 exchangereaction proceeds
much more rapidly than the oxidation of methane on CeO2.
This is also true of the case in the presence of Pt. Thus,
the cleavage of C–H bond of methane could not be the
rate-determining step in the overall oxidation of CH4 with
CeO2.

Isotope Effect in the Oxidation of Methane
In order to get further knowledge about the rate-deter-
mining step in the overall reaction of methane with CeO2,
the isotope effect (kH/kD) was measured by comparing the
conversion rates of CH4 and CD4. The reactions of CH4
and CD4 with CeO2 were performed using a closed gas-
circulation system under the same conditions. The conver-
sions of CH4 and CD4 versus reaction time are shown in
Fig. 10.
Similar to the results obtained in the reactions using the
gas ﬂow system described earlier, the products for these ex-
periments were also mainly CO and H2 or D2. The slopes
of the curves at the initial stage of the reaction (<30 min)
in Fig. 10 showed that the isotope effect (kH/kD) for the
conversion of methane was 1.1 ± 0.1. This low isotope ef-
fect may not contradict the suggestion obtained from the
CH4–CD4 exchange reaction, i.e., the cleavage of the C–H
bond is not the rate-determining step in the overall reac-
tion of methane into H2 and CO. We consider that this low
isotope effect is caused by other elementary steps involv-
ing hydrogen, probably the formation of H2 through the
recombination of H atoms or the desorption of H2.
Pulse Reaction
The reaction of CeO2 with CH4 pulses was carried out to
get further information about the mechanism for the reac-
tion between CeO2 and CH4 and the formation of H2 and
CO. The transient responses of the product pulses were
shown in Fig. 11. For the ﬁrst CH4 pulse, the formation of
CO2 was observed. The formation of CO2 may be a result
of the reaction of CH4 with the active oxygen on CeO2 sur-
face. However, no CO was observed for the ﬁrst to third
CH4 pulse reactions. The formation of CO was observed

from the fourth pulse of CH4 and the H2 peak was sharply
increased simultaneously. It should be noted that the sensi-
tivity of the TCD detector was 10 times higher for H2 than
for CO2 or CO. Thus, the observed H2 peak was much larger
than that of CO. The experimental results mentioned above
imply that the reduced sites on CeO2, i.e., the sites with Ce3+
and oxygen anion vacancies which are generated in the re-
actions of ﬁrst to third CH4 pulses, may be important for
the selective formation of H2 and CO.
Another experimental fact which should be noted is the
remarkable tailing of the H2 peak observed from the fourth
CH4 pulse. However, such notable tailing was not observed
for CH4 and CO peaks. Moreover, no tailing of H2 peak
was observed when a H2/CO pulse with a ratio of 2/1 was
injected to the reactor in the absence of CeO2 (the last
response peaks in Fig. 11). These observations imply that
the desorption of H2 from a slightly reduced cerium oxide is
a slow step. Thus we speculate that the recombination of H
atomsor thedesorptionofH2couldbetherate-determining
step in the formation of synthesis gas.
DISCUSSION
As described above, we have reported a novel method for
the selective conversion of CH4 to H2 and CO with a ratio
of 2 by gas–solid reaction between CH4 and CeO2 in the
absence of gaseous O2. Here, it should be stressed again that
CeO2 acts as not a catalyst but an oxidant for the oxidation
ofCH4.TheformationrateofH2andCOcanberemarkably
enhanced by adding Pt as a catalyst. The CeO2−x after the
reaction with CH4 (step 1) can be recovered by reactions
with CO2 and H2O (step 2), producing pure CO and H2,
respectively. The separation of the two steps is important,
since the catalytic reaction of CH4 with CO2 or H2O on
CeO2 did not give H2 and CO with a ratio of 2 without
producing H2O or CO2.
The FT-IR experiments suggested that the formation of
H2 and CO would not proceed through intermediates such
asadsorbedCH3OH(orCH3O)andHCHO.TheTPDmea-
surement for the chemisorbed species after the reaction
of CH4 with CeO2 suggested that adsorbed carbonaceous
species and hydrogen atoms were probably the reaction
intermediates. Thus, we speculate that the reaction may
proceed as follows:
CH4 →C(a) + 4H(a),
[8]
4H(a) →2H2,
[9]
xC(a) + CeO2 →xCO + CeO2−x.

A further detailed reaction mechanism which we have
in mind is shown in Fig. 12. As suggested by the results of
the pulse reaction experiments (Fig. 11), the reduced sur-
face sites, i.e., Ce3+ and oxygen vacancy, must be responsi-
ble for the activation of CH4 for the selective production

of H2 and CO. The carbon and hydrogen atoms thus formed
might be adsorbed in the vacancies near Ce3+. The rapid
CH4–CD4 exchange reaction and the small isotope effect
(kH/kD = 1.1 ± 0.1 at 650◦C) suggested that the cleavage
of CH4 on the Ce3+ sites was not the rate-determining
step.
CeO2 is the only oxygen source in the oxidation of CH4.
The degree of reduction of cerium oxide after a complete
reaction with CH4 (until neither H2 nor CO formation
was observed) reached 21%, suggesting that almost all the
CeO2 was reduced to Ce2O3. Obviously, such a large
amount oxygen consumed cannot be ascribed only to the
surface oxygen of CeO2. Thus, the lattice oxygen must
be responsible for the formation of CO. The experimen-
tal fact that the improvement of the diffusion of the lat-
tice oxygen does not increase the formation rates of H2
and CO allows us to speculate that the diffusion of lat-
tice oxygen is not the rate-determining step in the overall
reactions.
The low isotope effect (kH/kD = 1.1 ± 0.1) is consistent
with the results of CH4–CD4 exchange reactions that the
cleavage of CH4 is not the rate-determining step. This low
isotope effect further indicates that another elementary
step involving hydrogen atoms must control the reaction.
The obvious tailing of H2 in the transient response pulse re-
action suggests that the step for the formation of H2, which
involves the recombination of hydrogen atoms and the des-
orption of H2, is a slow step. The presence of Pt accelerates
this step as shown by the TPD measurement. We specu-
late that this enhancement may be achieved by a reverse
spillover mechanism, viz., the spillover of H atoms trapped
in the surroundings of Ce3+ to Pt sites where the recombi-
nation of H atoms or the desorption of H2 must occur more
facilely.
