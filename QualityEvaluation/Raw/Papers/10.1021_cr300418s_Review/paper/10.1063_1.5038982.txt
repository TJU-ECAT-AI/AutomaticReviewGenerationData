Abstract. In this work, the genetic algorithm has been introducted into parameter extraction for on-wafer inductors for up 
to 110 GHz millimeter-wave operations, and nine independent parameters of the equivalent circuit model are optimized 
together. With the genetic algorithm, the model with the optimized parameters gives a better fitting accuracy than the 
preliminary parameters without optimization. Especially, the fitting accuracy of the Q value achieves a significant 
improvement after the optimization. 
INTRODUCTION 
Parameter extraction and modeling with high accuracy for devices in the integrated circuit are very important. 
Although there are usually different modeling and parameter extraction methods for a certain kind of device, in most 
cases, optimization (finding best-fit parameters) needs to be taken to fit the model to the measured characteristics of 
the on-wafer device. 
After extracting the preliminary model parameters, sweeping the parameters in the neighboring area of the initial 
values is a common optimization method. Nevertheless, due to the exponential computing complexity, this method 
always spends too much time when too many parameters need to be optimized. Genetic algorithm (GA) [1] is a met 
heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). 
Genetic algorithm is commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying 
on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection [1, 2]. Usually, we can get a satisfying optimization 
result without too many iterations. 
In this work, a set of on-wafer inductors fabricated on HLMC 40 nm RF CMOS process are investigated. The 
model parameters of the inductors are extracted from the electromagnetic (EM) simulations, which are validated by 
the de-embedded measurements of the fabricated devices [3]. We apply a genetic algorithm to optimization of the 
model parameter extraction for the on-wafer inductors for up to 110 GHz operation, achieving a significant 
improvement on the fitting accuracy over the preliminary parameter extraction method without optimization. 
GENETIC ALGORITHM IN MODEL PARAMETER EXTRACTION 
In a genetic algorithm, a population of candidate solutions (called individuals) to an optimization problem is 
evolved toward better solutions. Each candidate solution has a set of properties (its chromosomes or genotype) which 
can be mutated and altered; traditionally, solutions are represented in binary as strings of 0s and 1s, but other encodings 
are also possible [2].

The evolution starts from a population of randomly generated individuals, and is an iterative process, with the 
population in each iteration called a generation. In each generation, the fitness of every individual in the population is 
evaluated; the fitness in the optimization problem being solved is defined by the user. The more fit individuals are 
stochastically selected with a larger probability from the current population, and each individual's genome is modified 
(recombined and randomly mutated) to form a new generation. The new generation of the candidate solutions is then 
used in the next iteration of the algorithm. The algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations 
has been produced, or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population.  
In parameter extraction of the on-wafer devices, we encode the parameters, which need to be optimized, to a 
chromosome and each genotype on the chromosome represents a parameter. The population size keeps unchanged in 
every generation. The reciprocal of the fitting error of the device characteristics between the model and the 
electromagnetic simulation is used as the fitness in the algorithm.

In (1)-(3), ܻ

The preliminary values of element parameters for this model are extracted with the parameter extraction method 
proposed in [4]. The preliminary values give a benchmark to set the lower and upper optimization boundary for each 
element parameter in the GA optimization process. 
In this work, a genetic algorithm is used to optimize parameter extraction for on-wafer inductors for up to 110 
GHz. 
As FIGURE 3 shows, these nine parameters are encoded into a binary chromosome with length of 90, where every 
10 continuous bit sequence in the chromosome is a genotype. The value of each parameter can be decoded with the 
corresponding genotype. Equation (4) shows the relationship between the genotype and the corresponding parameter 
value:

Where y is the parameter value, x is the genotype in decimal system, Max and Min are the upper and lower 
optimization boundary, respectively.

The generational process of the algorithm is repeated until the specified number of generations reached. In this 
work, the specified size of the population is 50 and the specified number of generations is 20. TABLE 1 shows the 
preliminary values and the final values after the GA optimization for the nine model parameters, respectively. As 
FIGURE 4 shows, the model with the optimized parameters gives a better fitting accuracy than the preliminary 
parameters without optimization. Especially, the fitting accuracy of the Q value is found to achieve a significant 
improvement after the optimization with GA. 
CONCLUSION 
With the genetic algorithm, all the parameters of the equivalent circuit model can be optimized and without too 
many iterations (generations) needed to get a satisfying solution. In this work, we apply a genetic algorithm to 
optimizing parameter extraction for the on-wafer inductors for up to 110GHz millimeter-wave operations, achieving 
a significant improvement on the fitting accuracy over the preliminary parameter extraction method without 
optimization.
