The screening parameter quoted in this paper =0.15
is not the one that was actually used in the code. In order to
reproduce
our
results,
two

values
are
needed:

=0.15/20.106
for
Hartree-Fock
and
=0.1521/3
0.189 for the PBE part.
This erratum applies to all of our PBEh and HSE cal-
culations published to date. We emphasize, however, that all
our results obtained with this functional are reproducible us-
ing the two  values quoted above. The validity of all our
published HSE values is not affected.
Optimization of a single value of  for a functional of
the type reported in this paper will be presented elsewhere.
We thank Oleg Vydrov and Artur Izmaylov for ﬁnding this
error.
