An aluminum defect in quartz has been studied by means of all-electron calculations based on the full-
potential linearized-augmented-plane-wave method. A comparative study of alumina, pure quartz, and Al-
substituted quartz shows that the Al impurity introduces levels between the bonding and nonbonding states of
pure SiO 2 a quartz; these features are shown to derive from the formation of the Al-O chemical bond. The
dangling bond in the @Al~O4) 1/2#2 unit is evenly shared among the four oxygen atoms adjacent to the defect,
and no bias of the charge density around the impurity is observed. A planar averaged potential energy curve for
a light carrier ion ~e.g., Li 1, H 1), trapped in an optical channel of the defective quartz has been determined
as a function of its location with respect to the aluminum position. @S0163-1829~96!01243-X#
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years intrinsic and extrinsic defects have been
extensively studied in both crystalline and amorphous
SiO 2, due to the great technological importance of this com-
pound. In fact modern research is investigating the properties
of materials designed to fulﬁll the requirements of sophisti-
cated applications. The main interest is focused on point de-
fects, localized near the sites of the constituent atoms of
chemically pure silica.1–10 One of the most important defects
in natural and hydrothermally grown synthetic quartz5,11 is
represented by Al 31 substituting for Si 41.5–10 The resulting
charge imbalance is compensated for either by an interstitial
alkali ion M 1 ~where M5Li, Na, or K!, by a proton H 1 or
by a hole h1 trapped at an oxygen atom, adjacent to the
aluminum. These charge compensators are located in the
large empty channels along the z axis, and form Al31-M 1,
Al-OH2, and Al31-h1centers, which can be observed by
means of various experimental techniques: mechanical loss
measurements have been performed to study the Al31-M 1
center,6
while

and
electron-
paramagnetic-resonance ~EPR! ~Refs. 8 and 12! detected
Al-OH2 and Al31-h 1 centers, respectively.
Most of quantum-mechanical or quantum-chemical calcu-
lations of the electronic properties of defective SiO 2 are
based on semiempirical methods, frequently restricted to
cluster models of limited size.3,4 On the other hand, numer-
ous solid-state calculations on point defects based on classi-
cal force ﬁelds9 exist: unfortunately they do not permit elec-
tronic structure investigations.
In the present work we study the modiﬁcations of the
electronic properties of a quartz ~the SiO 2 polymorph stable
at ambient conditions! induced by the presence of a substi-
tutional neutral Al impurity in the host lattice. A theoretical
investigation is performed by means of ab initio quantum-
mechanical
calculations
based
on
the
full-potential
linearized-augmented-plane-wave ~FLAPW! method.13 We
adopt a ‘‘supercell method,’’ which permits us straightfor-
wardly to exploit the tools implemented in band-structure
calculations. The advantage of this approach is to overcome
most of the problems related to the use of limited clusters,
since it permits us to describe the crystalline ﬁeld correctly.
We examine the electronic structure of the defective sys-
tem, comparing our results with those related to chemically
pure a quartz at room pressure, obtained in a previous
study,14 in order to understand the signiﬁcant changes in-
duced by the presence of the extrinsic point defect. In par-
ticular, impurity states are observed between bonding and
nonbonding states of pure SiO 2, which can be related to the
formation of the Al-O bond. In this regard, we obtained in-
sights from a parallel study of a-Al2O3, whose relevant re-
sults are also preliminarily discussed in the present work. An
accurate analysis of the charge density in the neighborhood
of the Al impurity suggested an unpreferential share of the
dangling bond among the four oxygens bound to the defect.
Finally, we were able to determine a planar averaged poten-
tial energy-curve which could be experienced by a light car-
rier ion moving along an optical channel of a defective
quartz sample.
II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
A. Structural details
We considered a supercell containing 18 atoms ~twice as
many as the unit cell of a quartz!: ﬁve Si, one neutral Al
~which substitutes for one neutral silicon! and 12 O atoms.
The formula unit of the resulting system is: SixAl12xO2,
where x5 5
6. We preserved the hexagonal shape of the unit
cell of a quartz,15,16 doubling it along the crystallographic
z axis. The symmetry subgroup contains only two opera-
tions: the identity and the twofold rotation around the crys-
tallographic x axis; ten atoms are independent for symmetry:
three silicon, one aluminum, and six oxygen atoms. In Table
I we list the complete set of structural data used for our
calculations, and in Fig. 1 we show the supercell of the de-
fective system.

parameters of Wyckoff21 ~Table II!. In Fig. 2~a! we show the
unit cell of a alumina. As can be noted, the structure of
corundum is quite different from that of a quartz @Fig. 2~b!#.
This is a result of the chemical bond of the two compounds,
as will be discussed below.
B. Computational parameters
Our ab initio calculations are based on the FLAPW
method, within density-functional theory22 in the local-
density approximation, as parametrized by Hedin and
Lundqvist.23
The mufﬁn-tin radius was chosen to be R 5 1.5 and 1.77
a.u. for all atomic types in defective quartz and a-Al2O3,
respectively. We used a cutoff KmaxR56.3 in both systems,
resulting in about 1900 and 1350 LAPW basis functions for
Al-substituted quartz and a alumina, respectively.
The self-consistency of the Si 5/6Al 1/6O 2 system was
achieved using nine special k points24 for the integration in
the irreducible wedge of the Brillouin zone ~IBZ!: this set is
equivalent to the one used in the calculations of a quartz14
and a alumina. Si and Al (3s, 3p) and O (2s, 2p) orbitals
were treated variationally as valence states, in the scalar rela-
tivistic approximation. For an accurate description of the
electronic density of states ~DOS! the Hamiltonian was di-
agonalized at 40 k points in the IBZ within the linear tetra-
hedron method.25
III. RESULTS
A. Electronic properties
In this section we discuss the modiﬁcations of the elec-
tronic properties induced by the presence of the substitu-
tional
defect,
comparing
the
results
of
the
defective
~Si5/6Al1/6O2) structure with those of perfect a quartz14 and
a alumina.20
In Fig. 3 the calculated density of states of the defective
system is reported, while in Fig. 4 we plot those for SiO 2
and a-Al2O3, as reference. In order to make the comparison
between different DOS’s easier, we labeled the main features
using equal numbers.
Comparing Fig. 3 with Fig. 4~a!, we can easily recognize
many similarities: the states at higher binding energy ~labels

gies (A3 and B3) are mainly O 2p bonding states; and those

close to the valence band, separated by a forbidden energy
range from the former, are O 2p nonbonding pz-like orbitals.
On the other hand, the major variations induced by the Al
impurity are represented by ~i! the partial closing of the for-
bidden energy range between O bonding and nonbonding
states @from -5.0 to -4.0 eV; A4 in Fig. 3~a!#; and ~ii! a peak
located at about 216.7 eV ~A2!. Some minor modiﬁcations
can be noted in the bonding and nonbonding (A3 and A5,
respectively! DOS features, expecially near the upper
(25.0 eV! and lower (23.8 eV! edges, respectively.
The projected density of states ~PDOS! can now tell us
the origin of these extra features induced by the defect. Let
us look, in particular, at the data for Al ~Fig. 3! and for the
oxygen atoms farthest from–and nearest to—Al ~see Table
III!: namely, O1 and O4 atoms, respectively. The observed
extra peaks are typical impurity states, originated by the for-
mation of the Al-O4 chemical bond. The main Al component
is, in fact, located in the energy range from ' 25.0 to
24.0 eV, and it is made of 3p bonding orbitals. In addition,
a relevant O4 component is found in the same energy range:
it corresponds to 2p bonding orbitals involved in the Al-O4
bond. Moreover, the position of O4 2p bonding states is
shifted toward lower binding-energy values, with a modiﬁ-
cation of the shape of the corresponding PDOS features.
On the other hand, the electronic states related to O1
~which is a bridging oxygen between two silicon atoms;
Table III! are substantially unaffected by the presence of Al
defect, as could be noted by the comparison of the O1 PDOS
~Fig. 3! with the oxygen atom in a quartz:14 only some mi-
nor differences seem to be introduced by the impurity.

ALL-ELECTRON STUDY OF THE ELECTRONIC . . .
Let us look now at the projected DOS diagrams for Si1
and Si3 atoms ~Table III!, reported in Fig. 3. We note that
Si1 is not directly bonded to Al, and that the features of its
PDOS components ~Fig. 3! are substantially unaffected and
are therefore very similar to those in pure a quartz.14 On the
other hand, some modiﬁcations are shown by the Si3 atom,
located at the minimum distance from Al ~Table III!. The
energy levels between 25.0 and 24.0 eV are due to
the interaction with the impurity, and are related to the
Al-O4-Si3 bond. It is interesting to note that the dis-
tance of these atoms from the point defect plays an important
role: almost all features due to the impurity, present in
Si3 DOS have disappeared in Si1. Now we can observe that
the minimum distance between two Al atoms is ;4.9 Å, and
that this value is rougly in between the Si3–Al and Si1–Al
distances (;3.1 and ;5.4 Å, respectively!. Therefore, since
the effects on the electronic states due to the presence of the
impurity tend to disappear as the interatomic distance Si-Al
increase, ~the PDOS for Si1 is nearly identical to the PDOS
in pure a quartz!, we can infer that the interactions between
two adjacent defects are nearly negligible. This conﬁrms that
the size of our system is, in ﬁrst approximation, large enough
to signiﬁcantly minimize the interactions of defects located
in neighboring cells.
This preliminary analysis of the DOS indicates that the
impurity states of our system have a prevalent localized na-
ture: they are due to short-range interactions related to the
formation of the chemical bond between the substitutional
impurity and the atoms of the original host lattice. As already
noted, these states are made of O 2p and Al 3p bonding
orbitals and they produce a partial closing of the forbidden
energy range present in pure a quartz. A similar situation is
present in a-Al2O3. In fact, in this compound two relevant
differences can be noted in the valence band with respect to
a quartz: ~i! the absence of the forbidden energy range be-
tween bonding and nonbonding O p states; and ~ii! the larger
extension of the topmost portion of the valence band in
SiO 2 @;9.5 eV; features B3 and B5 of Fig. 4~a!# compared
to a-Al2O3 @;7.5 eV; C3 and C5 DOS regions in Fig.
4~b!#.
Now let us consider the charge-density contour maps. In
Fig. 5 we plot the valence charge density of Si 5/6Al 1/6O 2,
projected in the Al-O4-Si3 @Fig. 5, panel ~a!# and in the
Si1-O1-Si2 @Fig. 5~b!# bonding plane, compared to the
charge density of a quartz, projected in the plane cutting the
Si-O-Si angle @Fig. 5~c!#. The charge accumulation along the
bonding directions in Fig. 5~a! shows only a slight asymme-
try along Al-O4 and Si3-O4 bonding directions. It is inter-
esting to observe the partial electronic depletion along the
Al-O4 direction, due to the impurity which has one electron
less than the host silicon atoms. In Fig. 5~b!, the charge
density around the oxygen site does not show any distortions
and it is qualitatively very similar to the valence charge den-
sity of a quartz Fig. 5~c!.
Let us now look at how the different groups of valence
states contribute to the charge density. In Fig. 6 we plot the
charge density of the Si5/6Al1/6O2 structure, corresponding to
the states labeled A3 and A4 in Fig. 3 @panels ~a! and ~b!,
respectively# and those labeled A5 in Fig. 3 @panel ~c!#, pro-
jected in the Al-O4-Si3 bonding plane. In Figs. 6~a! and 6~b!,
the distortions of the charge density appear clearly; the bond-
ing character of the impurity states whose corresponding
charge density shows a relevant asymmetry along Al-O4 and
Si3-O4 directions is also evident. On the other hand, the
highest valence states @Fig. 6, panel ~c!# exihibit the familiar
SiO 2 nonbonding nature: the variations with respect to the
perfect crystal are here less drastic ~e.g., the electronic deple-
tion around the oxygen site is almost irrelevant!; neverthe-
less, a slight asymmetry seems to affect the local charge
distribution.
B. Dangling bond around the Al site
and the average potential curve
As discussed in Sec. III A, the charge depletion around Al
atomic site is due to the reduced valence of the substitutional
impurity with respect to the silicon atoms: this results in a
dangling bond located in the @Al~O4) 1/2#2 unit. An accurate
analysis of the charge density around the defect shows that
the dangling bond is evenly shared among the four oxygen
atoms close to the Al impurity. This can be deduced by the
electronic charge deformation map, i.e., the difference be-
tween the charge densities of the defective and pure solid,
projected in the corresponding bonding planes. In Fig. 7 we
plot the charge-density difference betweenSi5/6Al1/6O2 and
a quartz, projected in the Al-O4-Si3 plane which also cor-
responds to the Si-O-Si asymmetric bonding plane in pure
quartz. It is possible to observe the charge depletion around

Al site, in a spherical region whose mean radius is about
1.25R. This effect is partially reduced along the Al-O bond-
ing direction, due to the charge accumulation localized at the
oxygen site. The most relevant feature is the unpreferential
share of the dangling bond: this is due to the almost ideal
tetrahedral coordination, which is not compatible with any
directional bias of the charge density. This result indicates
that the relaxation process will involve atomic displacements
around the impurity that would destroy the local symmetry
and cause a rearrangement of atoms belonging to many co-
ordination shells. The correct treatment of such processes is a
very demanding computational task and is beyond the aim of
the present calculation.
Additional insights can be obtained considering the planar
average of the charge density and the corresponding poten-
tial, performed on planes perpendicular to the crystallo-
graphic z axis. In Fig. 8~a! we show the macroscopic average
difference „Dr(z)… of the charge densities in defective and
pure a quartz averaged on planes perpendicular to the z axis,
calculated according to Baroni, Resta, and Baldereschi.29
The electronic charge depletion around the impurity is
evident, while we must note that the charge difference is
already vanishing at the positions of the nearest Si atoms.
This further conﬁrm that the effects produced by the impu-
rity are substantially localized and that the interactions be-
tween two adjacent Al atoms are nearly negligible.
Solving the Poisson equation for the macroscopic average
charge density r(z) for each compound, it is possible to
determine the planar average of the electrostatic potential in
each cell.29 In Fig. 8~b! the macroscopic planar average of
the potential for defective and pure quartz is shown. For both
materials the macroscopic average potential can represent an

approximate estimate of the potential experienced by a light
carrier ion moving along an open channel without perturbing
the host lattice. This result may be very useful to understand
the ionic transport phenomena,9,10,26–28 if those can be de-
scribed by an Arrhenius-like equation. In fact an alkali-ion
M 1 or a proton H 1 present in a real defective quartz sample
may move along the large open channels parallel to the crys-
tallographic z axis when a proper electrical ﬁeld is applied.
The ionic mobility process is controlled in ﬁrst approxima-
tion by the average planar potential, as that reported in Fig.
8~b! ~solid line!. Of course, this simpliﬁed description is
valid if the carrier ion is sufﬁciently light ~e.g., Li 1, H 1) as
it does not perturb signiﬁcantly the host lattice and if the
potential shape on the x-y plane can be well represented by
its average value. On the other hand, the average potential
curve of pure a quartz @Fig. 8~b!, dashed line# could repre-
sent the potential experienced by an ion moving along a
channel far away from the Al atomic position, as experimen-
tally observed in defective X-irradiated quartz samples, in
which Al 31 is electrically neutralized by a hole so that
charge carrier ions can freely move.10 The calculated average
potential curve shows a two-minimum well centered on the
Al position, in agreement with some model calculations and
with transport measurements for Na 1 ions.10 Of course, a
comparison with the experimental data is possible only on a
qualitative basis as far as the overall shape of the potential is
concerned, since we averaged out variations on the x–y
plane. Moreover, the size and shape of the effective potential
barrier are expected10 to vary, through screening and size-
dependent mechanisms, with the chemical species of the
alkali-ion considered.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
We presented results of a FLAPW investigation of the
electronic properties of quartz with an Al impurity substitut-
ing for a Si atom. The analysis shows that the most signiﬁ-
cant changes induced by the defect are represented by the
occurrence of impurity states, prevalently located in the en-
ergy range between 25.0 and 24.0 eV, corresponding to
p-like Al and O bonding orbitals. The variations are strictly
localized and involve the electronic structure around host
atoms which are directly bonded to the extrinsic defect. On
the other hand, atoms sufﬁciently far away from the impurity
are unaffected by the presence of Al. Moreover, the size of
our system seems to be sufﬁciently large to minimize the
interactions between neighboring defects.
Finally, an averaged potential-energy curve for a light
carrier ion ~e.g., Li 1, H 1), trapped in an optical channel of
the defective quartz and which does not perturb the host
lattice during its motion, has been determined as a function
of its location with respect to the Al position. This can rep-
resent an approximate estimate of the potential controlling
ionic transport processes in a real defective quartz sample.
