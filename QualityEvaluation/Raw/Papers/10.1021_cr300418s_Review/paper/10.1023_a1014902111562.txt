Abstract
Calcined hydrotalcite-like compounds were effective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the presence of CO2 as an oxidant. X-ray diffraction patterns suggested that the catalyst components are distributed uniformly. The activity (areal rate) of Fe(1)/Al(2)/Zn(6) oxide catalyst (molar ratios in parentheses) was the highest among the catalysts tested.
