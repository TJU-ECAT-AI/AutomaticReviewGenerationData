Abstract
The structure mobility of the zigzag mercuric oxide chains and the strong preference of mercuric (II) cation sites for bromine lead to a novel
bromine-mediated partial methane oxidation at relatively low reaction temperature (220 8C). Zn-MCM-41 supported mercuric oxide nanophases
were used as the model catalyst to investigate the role of bromine in the catalytic cycle. The introduction of bromine to feed gas consisting of CH4/
O2/Ar (3:1:6) leads to a sharp increase in the methane conversion. Meanwhile, a transient high product selectivity to C1 oxygenates was observed.
Two bromine-mediated routes can be identiﬁed: MeHgBrn as the intermediate species and mercuric hypobromite as the active agent for methane
oxidation, which occur simultaneously in the methane conversion. The controlling mechanism transfers from the former to the latter with the
gradual ﬁxation of bromine into mercuric oxide lattice. The catalyst was characterized detailedly by XRD, XPS, and N2 sorption. The chemical
composite changes of active species were detected by XPS, which provide some direct information about the mediator role of bromine in the
catalytic cycle.

1. Introduction
The catalytic partial oxidation of methane (POM) to C1
oxygenates remains a challenging task with high pay-off,
because of the low reactivity of the substrate and the poor
selectivity to the desired products (CH3OH and/or H2CO)[1–7].
Many low temperature homogeneous processes in strong acidic
media have been reported to convert methane to various methyl
derivatives such as methanol [8,9], methane sulfonic acid
[10,11], methane sulfonyl chlorides [12], methyl bisulfate
[13,14], and acetic acid [15–18]. But the POM over solid
catalysts requires high reaction temperature and the selectivity to
C1 oxygenates is poor. The target products (CH3OH and/or
H2CO) are less thermodynamically stable than methane and
hence are further oxidized to carbon oxides. A great deal of
research has focused on many factors controlling the process
activity and selectivity. Adding NOx into reactant stream of CH4/
O2 has been proved to be an efﬁcient approach to increase the
activity and selectivity of POM over silica supported vanadium
oxides [19–21]. Dispersion and localization state of the active
phasesisanotheraffecting factor determiningthe performance of
POM catalysts. The isolated active sites can prevent the over-
oxidation of C1 oxygenates to carbon oxides, but the
agglomerated active sites may lead to the sequent oxidation of
C1 oxygenates by the vicinal sites of the reaction site [22–28].
Halogen-mediated conversion ofmethanehasbeen consideredto
be a low temperature process with relatively high selectivity to
C1 oxygenates. Olah et al. have described a sequential two-step
process including the selective monohalogenation of methane
over supported acid and platinum-metal catalysts and the
following hydrolysis of methyl halides over g-alumina-
supported metal oxide/hydroxide catalysts converts methane
to methanol and dimethyl ether [29]. Lorkovic et al. proposed a
process for the functionalization of methane and ethane using
bromine as the mediator over a sequential zone ﬂow reactor
(SZFR) [30]. Recently we have reported a bromine-mediated
process by using supported hydrate dibromodioxomolybdenum
as catalysts [31]. The above processes all proceed via the

selective halogenation of methane followed by the catalytic
dehalogenation of methyl halide to oxygenate. Herein, we
investigate bromine-mediated selective methane oxidation
process over supported mercuric oxide nanophases. Bromine
is involved in the catalytic cycle both by forming methyl bromide
and by activating the lattice oxygen of active sites and facilitating
the regeneration of active sites.
‘‘Soft’’ mercuric cation sites show a strong preference for
halogens [32]. Methyl bromide can be facilely converted to
MeHgBrn, which is further oxidized to C1 oxygenates.
Elemental bromine can be inserted into zigzag –O–Hg–O–
Hg–O– chains at room temperature and the lattice oxygens are
activated to give highly active catalytic oxidation agents:
mercuric hypobromite, which are active for methane oxidation
under mild conditions [33] (Scheme 1). The resulting mercuric
bromide lattice can be facilely reoxidized to HgO chains by
dioxygen under 200 8C. The released bromine is recycled to
activate the lattice oxygens in HgO chains and form methyl
bromide.
Through
this
mechanism,
a
bromine-mediated
methane oxidative conversion catalytic cycle can be proposed
(Scheme 2). Because of the special reactions between mercuric
(II)
oxide and
bromine, the supported
mercuric
oxide
nanophases are the excellent model catalyst to investigate
the role of bromine in the catalytic cycle.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of the catalyst
Zn-MCM-41 was prepared as the following method. 1.2 g
Zn(OH)2 was dissolved in 9.5 g 25 wt.% ammonia and then the
mixture was added into 120 ml aqueous solution of 2.4 g
cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide.
Ten
grams
tetraethyl
orthosilicate was added drop by drop in 15 min. After a few
minutes, the formed white solids were ﬁltered and dried in air at
90 8C. Calcining at 90 8C for 6 h gives Zn-MCM-41. The
aqueous solution of Hg(NO3)2 and NH4NO3 was introduced
into the mesopores of Zn-MCM-41 by wet impregnation. The
incipient sample was dried at 70 8C in air and treated at 300 8C
under argon stream to give Zn-MCM-41 supported HgO.
2.2. Catalytic activity test
Catalytic activity measurement (1.6 g catalysts, load of HgO
is 8.0 wt.%) was conducted in a conventional ﬁxed bed reactor
at 220 8C with the feed gas consisting of methane, oxygen, and
argon (PAr : PCH4 : PO2 ¼ 6 : 3 : 1, W/F = 0.3 g min cm3). At
1.5 h on the reaction stream, bromine (2.0 mmol Br2) is injected
into a gasiﬁcation chamber and conveyed into the catalyst
column by feed gas. The product analysis was performed on a
DB5 column (30 m  0.25 mm) using a VG Trio200 with TCD
or MS detector. Conversion and selectivity are deﬁned as %
conversion = [([CH4]inlet  [CH4]outlet)/[CH4]inlet]  100
and
% selectivity to X = [[X]/([CH4]inlet  [CH4]outlet)]  100.
2.3. Characterizations of the catalyst
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained
with an ESCALab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG
Scientiﬁc using 300 WAl-Ka radiation. The base pressure was
about 3  109 mbar. The binding energies were referenced to

the C 1s line at 284.8 eV from adventitious carbon. Eclipse
V2.1 data analysis software supplied by the VG ESCALab200i-
XL instrument manufacturer was applied in manipulation of the
acquired spectra. Powder XRD patterns were measured on a
Rigadu Rotaﬂex diffractometer equipped with a rotation anode
and Cu-Ka radiation (40 kV, 200 mA; l = 1.54056 A
˚ ). Nitro-
gen adsorption isothermal and textural properties of the as-
synthesized materials were determined at 77.3 K using nitrogen
by a Quantachrome Autosorb Automated Gas Sorption System
(Quantachrome Corporation). Before analysis, HgO/Zn-MCM-
41 was dried at 70 8C under vacuum for 16 h and Zn-MCM-41
was dried at 300 8C under vacuum for 6 h.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Chemical and physical properties of the as-synthesized
catalysts
The powder X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 1a) of the as-
synthesized sample exhibits four diffraction peaks correspond-
ing to d (1 0 0) of 4.2437 nm, d (1 1 0) of 2.3480 nm, d (2 0 0)
of 2.0487 nm and weak d (2 1 0), which are a typical MCM-41
XRD reﬂection pattern. The incorporation of HgO causes
marked intensity decrease of the four peaks. However, the basal
(1 0 0) and (1 1 0) diffraction peaks are clearly observed. This
indicates that the structure of Zn-silica mesoporous sieves
remains intact through the supporting procedure. With the
increase of mercuric oxide loads, three XRD reﬂection peaks of
introduced species are detected, as shown in Fig. 1b.
Mesopores of MCM-41 type materials can greatly expand the
capabilities of heterogeneous catalysis [34]. The capillary
condensation occurs inside the mesoporous channels, allowing
a relatively high concentration of reactant molecules inside the
mesoporous channels. Thus, when taking the mesoporous
channels as the microreactors, the reaction would proceed as
if it were carried out at higher partial pressure compared with
most other catalytic solid surfaces. The N2 adsorption–
desorption isotherm of Zn-MCM-41 exhibits a typical capillary
condensation step for mesopores in the relative pressure (P/P0)
range of 0.20.4 (Fig. 2). The sharpness and height of the
capillary step indicate that the resulting materials have good
mesopore structure ordering. A hysteresis loop is observed for
the difference between desorption isotherm and adsorption
isotherm cause mesopore capillary condensation. The introdu-
cing of mercuric oxide leads to a marked loss of surface area.
However, the capillary condensation step and the hysteresis loop
are observed in the adsorption–desorption isotherm of HgO/Zn-
MCM-41. This indicates that the loading of mercuric oxide
causes little changes in the mesopore structure, which have been
interpreted by the powder X-ray diffraction pattern. The marked
loss of surface area is due to partially shutting off two-
dimensionalpore systemsofMCM-41inthewet impregnationof
mercuric oxide precursors. Chemical composite of the as-
synthesized catalyst was characterized by XPS. ZnO (Zn 2p3/2:
1023.0 eV) andHgO(Hg4d5/2: 361.6 eV)was detected (Fig.4a).
3.2. Bromine-mediated methane conversion and the role of
bromine in catalytic cycle
As shown in Scheme 2, the involvement of bromine is the
key mechanism for oxidative conversion of methane to C1

oxygenates. Two possible reaction cycles are proposed: the
cycle I with MeHgBrn as the intermediate species and the cycle
II with mercuric hypobromite as the active agent for methane
oxidation. Time-on-stream (TOS) results are shown in Fig. 3.
At 1.5 h on the reaction stream, bromine (2.0 mmol Br2) is
injected into a gasiﬁcation chamber and conveyed into the
catalyst column by feed gas. The presence of bromine in feed
gas leads to a sharp increase in the methane conversion
(Fig. 3a), which demonstrates the mediator role of bromine in
the methane conversion. After reaching the maximum, the
methane conversion decreases gradually and ﬂuctuates around
10%. Before introducing bromine, carbon oxides are the main
products under about 2% methane conversion. With the
addition of bromine, the total selectivity to C1 oxygenates
(formaldehyde, methanol, and
dimethyl ether)
increases
greatly, which reaches the maximum value of 87.6% and
gradually decreases with reaction run (Fig. 3b). In all process,
bromine and methyl bromide are not detected in the outlet ﬂow
of the catalyst column. The role of Zn contents in the bromine-
mediated process has been established [31]. As shown by
Scheme 3, the involvement of ZnO multiplies the chance of
scavenging the bromine from HBr and C–Br functionality to
yield the oxidized products. The moderate bromine metathesis
rate of ZnBr2/ZnO pairs is an important mechanism for holding
bromine in the catalyst column and the promoting effects of
ZnBr2 upon C–H bond bromination may also reduce the
leaching of unreacted bromine.
The methane oxidation over general oxide catalysts requires
high reaction temperature and the selectivity to C1 oxygenates
is poor. The target products (CH3OH and/or H2CO) are less
thermodynamically stable than methane and hence are further
oxidized to carbon oxides. But such bromine-mediated
methane conversion over mercuric oxide nanophases shows
relatively high selectivity to C1 oxygenates at reaction
temperature of 220 8C. As revealed by Scheme 2, there are
two possible reaction routes. In the cycle I, methyl bromide is
ﬁrst formed, and then combined with active mercuric (II) sites
to give MeHgBrn, which is the precursor of C1 oxygenates. For
this mechanism, the bromine concentration in the reactant ﬂow
must be kept high enough to product methyl bromide to sustain
the sequent conversion. The isolated mercuric (II) cation center
combined with methyl can avoid the over-oxidation of products
and increase the selectivity to C1 oxygenates. In the cycle II,
mercuric hypobromite formed through the insertion of bromine
into zigzag –O–Hg–O–Hg–O– chains, which releases the
activated lattice oxygen atoms to form Br2O, shows high
activity for methane oxidation. However, the over-oxidation of
target products cannot be avoided and the total selectivity to C1
oxygenates is relatively low when the methane conversion is
controlled by this mechanism. As revealed by the tendency of
TOS data and product distribution with reaction run (Fig. 3),
both mechanisms may occur in the bromine-mediated methane
conversion. In the incipient stage after bromine introducing,
there is high bromine concentration in the reaction ﬂow and the
main reaction routes is the cycle I. The conversion process
shows high selectivity to C1 oxygenates, as observed in Fig. 3b.
However, bromine is gradually ﬁxed into the mercuric oxide
lattice with time on stream. The controlling mechanism
transfers to the cycle II and the selectivity to C1 oxygenates
decreases markedly.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements provide
direct information about the role of bromine in the methane
conversion. Fig. 4a shows XPS survey spectra of a fresh catalyst
and three catalysts exposed to different feed gas. The samples
attacked by bromine containing feed gas shows the formation
of bromine compounds in the catalytic cycle. The speciﬁcation
of Br 3d peaks reveals the coexistence of two chemical states of
bromine: HgBr2 (Br 3d: 70 eV) and Hg(OBr)2 (Br 3d: 73.8 eV)
(Fig. 4b). Compared with HgBr2, the concentration of

Hg(OBr)2 is lower because of its high activity. This result
demonstrates that methane oxidation via the mercuric sites
activated by the insertion of bromine into zigzag mercuric oxide
chains (the cycle II) occurs in the total bromine-mediated
methane conversion. But the marked ﬂuctuation of the
selectivity during the incipient stage suggests a different
controlling mechanism. Fig. 4c shows the C 1s XPS peaks of
the samples exposed to the feed gas containing bromine. The
peaks at binding energy of 284.8 eV are from adventitious
carbon, which is inevitable in XPS determination. The catalyst
on the reaction stream of Ar/CH4/O2/Br2 for 1.0 h shows two
well deﬁned C 1s peaks: adventitious carbon (284.8 eV) and
MeHgBrn (282.6 eV), but the catalyst on the reaction stream of
Ar/CH4/O2/Br2 for 3.0 h only shows the C 1s peak of
adventitious
carbon.
Meanwhile,
the
selectivity
to
C1
oxygenates exhibits a gradually decrease (Fig. 3b). The
disappearance of C 1s peak (MeHgBrn, 282.6 eV) with time
on stream demonstrates the controlling mechanism gradually
transfers from the cycle I to the cycle II with time-on-stream.
Herein, it is concluded that both bromine-mediated routes
described in the cycle I and the cycle II occur simultaneously in
the methane conversion and the main mechanism transfers from
the cycle I to the cycle II with the gradual ﬁxation of bromine
into mercuric oxide lattice.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we present a novel bromine-mediated process
over supported HgO nanophases for selective methane partial
oxidation at relatively low reaction temperature. A transient
high product selectivity to C1 oxygenates was observed under
the methane conversion of 13%, and then the methane
conversion and the selectivity to C1 oxygenates gradually
decrease and ﬂuctuate around 10% and 55%, respectively. This
special methane conversion was applied as the model reaction
to investigate the role of bromine in the catalytic cycle. Two
reaction routes can be identiﬁed: the cycle I with MeHgBrn as
the intermediate species and the cycle II with mercuric
hypobromite as the active agent for methane oxidation. Both
bromine-mediated routes occur simultaneously in the methane
conversion and the main mechanism transfers from the cycle I
to the cycle II with the gradual ﬁxation of bromine into

exploration of the processes with analogous reaction mechan-
ism is under way to substitute for the mercuric active phases,
