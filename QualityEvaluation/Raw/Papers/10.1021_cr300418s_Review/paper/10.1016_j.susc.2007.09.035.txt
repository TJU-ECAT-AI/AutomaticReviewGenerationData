Abstract
Niobia/alumina model catalysts were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Nb in an oxygen atmosphere onto thin alumina ﬁlms.
Structural characterization, performed with scanning tunneling microscopy and infrared reﬂection absorption spectroscopy, revealed
highly dispersed N2O5 nanoparticles exposing Nb@O groups. Thermal stability of the system was also examined. The results are com-
pared with those obtained on thin niobia ﬁlms and previously studied vanadia/alumina systems.

1. Introduction
Niobium oxide based catalysts have received much
attention due to their potential use in many industrially
important processes such as the Fischer–Tropsch reaction,
oxidative coupling of methane, etc. (e.g., see [1–8]). In these
catalysts, the niobia is basically used as a support for
highly
dispersed
metal
particles
and
typically
forms
Nb2O5 crystallites, which may exist in diﬀerent polymorphs
depending on the heat treatment [9,10]. In addition, the
niobia can also participate as an active component when
added to other high surface area oxides such as alumina
and silica, thus forming so called ‘‘monolayer’’ type cata-
lysts based on the structural model where oxide spreads
over support [11–15]. The supported niobia catalysts often
show enhanced catalytic performance as compared to the
bulk oxide systems (see e.g. [2,3,16]). The atomic structure
of the niobia as well as other monolayer catalysts continues
to be debated in the literature (see [5,17,18] and references
therein).
In order to understand structure–reactivity relationships
for niobia based catalysts and elucidate the reaction mech-
anisms, we have recently begun model studies using well-
ordered niobium oxide thin ﬁlms grown on a metal sub-
strate [19,20]. In continuation of these studies, here we re-
port on the preparation and structure of niobia/alumina
model catalysts. Structural characterization was performed
with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and infrared
reﬂection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). Thermal stabil-
ity of these systems was also examined. In addition, we
have compared niobia and vanadia model catalysts since
both belong to the Group V transition metals, and vanadia
is more well studied in the literature. This may also be help-
ful in revealing similarities and trends in structure–reactiv-
ity relationships for the Group V oxide catalysts.
2. Experimental
The experiments were carried out in two ultra-high vac-
uum (UHV) chambers (base pressure below 5 · 1010
mbar) denoted as ‘‘STM’’ and ‘‘IRAS’’. Both chambers
are equipped with standard facilities for surface cleaning,
quadrupole mass-spectrometer (QMS, Hiden) and four-
grid low energy electron diﬀraction (LEED, Specs), also
used for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The IRAS
chamber is additionally equipped with high-resolution

electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS, Delta 0.5, VSI
GmbH).
The crystal temperature was controlled using a chromel–
alumel thermocouple spot-welded to the edge of the crystal
and a feedback control system (Schlichting Phys. Instrum.).
In the STM chamber, heating was achieved by electron
bombardment from the backside of the crystal using a W
ﬁlament. For the IRAS studies, the crystal was placed be-
tween two parallel Ta wires used for resistive heating.
Gases (CO and O2, both 5.0 from AGA) were exposed to
the samples using a directional gas doser.
The thin alumina ﬁlms were grown on a NiAl(110) sin-
gle crystal as described elsewhere [21–23]. The surface was
cleaned by a standard procedure including cycles of Ar+
sputtering and annealing to 1250 K and checked by AES.
Then the surface was exposed to 106 mbar O2 at 550 K
and annealed in UHV (5 min, 1140 K). The oxidation-
annealing procedure was repeated in order to form a dense,
hole-free alumina ﬁlm.
Niobium (as well as vanadium) was vapor deposited
onto the alumina ﬁlm in 107 mbar O2 at 300 K from a
Nb (V) rod (2 mm diameter, Goodfellow, 99.99%) using
a commercial evaporator (Focus EFM3). The deposition
rate was calibrated using a quartz microbalance (in the
IRAS chamber) or by STM, and was in the range of
0.05 A
˚ /min. The niobium oxide coverage is presented in
the text in amounts of metallic Nb as a nominal thickness
(in A
˚ ). Approximately 1.6 A
˚ of Nb corresponds to Nb2O5
monolayer coverage [19].
Photoelectron spectra were measured on the niobia ﬁlms
using synchrotron radiation at BESSY II (Berlin, beamline
UE52-PGM1). The spectra were taken with a Scienta
SES200 analyzer. Spectra were recorded with a photon en-
ergy of 310 eV for Nb 3d level. The energy was calibrated
via the Fermi edge and also the binding energy of the Au
4f level (84.0 eV) of a clean gold foil.
The HREEL-spectra on the niobia ﬁlms were measured
in a specular geometry (grazing angle 30, spectral resolu-
tion 4 meV) with a primary electron energy 5 eV.
The STM images presented here were subjected to plane
corrections and low-pass ﬁltering.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows a series of STM images of the niobia/alu-
mina surface prepared at room temperature at increasing
niobia coverage. At 0.1 A
˚ coverage, the particles are ran-
domly dispersed on the surface, i.e. both on and between
the line defects (antiphase and reﬂection domain bound-
aries, steps) clearly visible in Fig. 1a. As previously shown
for other metal deposits on the alumina ﬁlm, the particle
spatial distribution basically reﬂects the degree of metal
support interaction [21,22]. The absence of preferential
nucleation for niobia, as shown in Fig. 1, can be interpreted
as a relatively strong interaction between Nb atoms and the
alumina surface.
Particle density increases with the coverage up to 1 A
˚
and then saturates at 2 · 1013 cm2, while the average
particle height is nearly constant from the onset (see
Fig. 1f). Note that at high coverage the particle size is dif-
ﬁcult to determine precisely due to the tip deconvolution
eﬀect. Obviously, niobia grows in a three-dimensional
mode under these conditions.
Infrared spectroscopy was used to study the surface
structure of the alumina supported niobia particles. The
IRAS method allows one to investigate phonon vibrations

at oxide surfaces as well as of adsorbates such as CO used
here as a probe molecule. The phonon region of the IRA-
spectra is shown in Fig. 2a. The pristine alumina ﬁlm
exhibits a sharp peak at 865 cm1 as previously reported
[23]. The alumina phonon attenuates upon niobia deposi-
tion and a new band appears as a shoulder at around
900 cm1, ultimately resulting in a broad signal centered
at 885 cm1 for the highest niobia coverage studied. The
spectral broadening is consistent with the formation of ran-
domly dispersed small niobia particles as revealed by STM.
At the coverage of 1 A
˚ , a band centered at 986 cm1
emerges which grows in intensity with the coverage.
The assignment of these spectral features is facilitated by
comparison with the results on a supported vanadia system
previously studied in detail [17,24,25]. For convenience, the
bottom curve in Fig. 2a shows the spectrum obtained for
the similarly prepared 3.5 A
˚ vanadia/aluimina sample in
the same experimental setup. Based on Raman and IR
spectroscopy results, the peak at 1045 cm1 has been as-
signed to the stretching of vanadyl (V@O) groups. Mean-
while the broad signal at 950 cm1 is associated with
vibrations involving V–O–Al linkage at the vanadia/alu-
mina interface as predicted by theoretical calculations
[17,24]. Therefore, turning back to the niobia/alumina sys-
tem, the peak at 986 cm1 must be assigned to the niobyl
(Nb@O) stretching, and the signal at 890 cm1 must be as-
signed to Nb–O–Al interface vibrations, which should
show lower frequencies as compared to vanadia/alumina,
based solely on mass considerations (Nb atom is heavier
than V).
This conclusion is further supported by HREELS and
PES
studies
of
the
thin
niobia
ﬁlms
grown
on
a
Cu3Au(100) substrate (see Fig. 3). The PE-spectra for
the well-ordered monolayer ﬁlms [19] showed the binding
energy (BE) of the Nb3d5/2 core level to be 206.4 eV, which
is a bit lower than observed for Nb2O5 [26,27] due to the
well-known screening eﬀect of the metal substrate under-
neath. According to the structure of the monolayer ﬁlm
proposed [6], it contains the outmost oxygen ions in the
bridge position forming the Nb–O–Nb bonds. As a result,
HREEL-spectra only showed the signal at 703 cm1, i.e.
typical for stretching and/or bending vibrations of the
Nb–O–Nb linkage [28].
Thicker niobia ﬁlms, prepared on the same substrate by
repeated cycles of Nb deposition and annealing at 900 K in
106 mbar O2, are less ordered than the monolayer ﬁlms as
judged by LEED and STM. The PES measurements re-
vealed the signal at 207.4 eV for the Nb3d5/2 level (see
Fig. 3) clearly showing that the multilayer niobia ﬁlms con-
sist of Nb cations in the highest oxidation state, 5+. Con-
comitantly, the small shoulder at 206.4 eV, observed at
normal electron emission and not in grazing emission,
can be assigned to Nb ions at the niobia/substrate
interface.
In contrast to the monolayer ﬁlms, the multilayer niobia
ﬁlms showed energy losses at 565, 842 and 984 cm1. To
the best of our knowledge, only Xie et al. [29] reported
on vibrational properties of the niobia ﬁlms. The authors
prepared diﬀerent thin ﬁlms (NbOx and Nb2O5 in their
notation) on Pt(111), which turned out to be of a poor
crystallinity. These ﬁlms showed signals at 384 and
926 cm1 in HREEL-spectra. (Note the limited resolution
of the spectra reported in [29]: 96 cm1 vs 50 cm1 in
our work.) The authors assigned the high frequency band
to the stretching vibrations of Nb@O species, although
the frequency is signiﬁcantly lower than any observed on
H–Nb2O5 but much higher than that of other stable crys-
talline (T- and TT-) or amorphous phases of niobium pent-
oxide (700–870 cm1) by Raman and IR spectroscopy [30–
32]. Note also for comparison that the NbO2 phase showed
transverse optical phonons below 700 cm1 [33], which
would
correspond
to
surface
phonon
frequencies
of
807 cm1 as calculated in [29].

Based on the spectral characteristics of reference Nb
compounds, Jehng and Wachs [32] proposed a correlation
between the stretching frequencies of Nb–O surface sites
and the extent of distortion of NbO6 octahedra, which
compose most of the niobium oxide compounds via edge
and corner sharing. These authors suggested that highly
and slightly distorted structures exhibit vibrations in the re-
gions of 850–1000 cm1 and 500–700 cm1, respectively. It
should be mentioned however that, due to the existence of
many often coexisting metastable polymorphs of Nb2O5,
the precise peak position may critically depend on the sam-
ple preparation. Note also that IRA- and HREEL-spec-
troscopy of the thin ﬁlms grown on refractory metal
substrates follow the selection rules, whereby only vibra-
tions resulting in a dynamic dipole moment perpendicular
to the metal surface will be detected. Therefore, some
vibrational bands in IR (and Raman) spectra on powders
may be inactive in the IRAS measurements of the thin ﬁlms
and supported nanoparticles, thus making the comparison
rather uncertain. However, it is clear that the bands above
900 cm1 must be associated with the surface Nb@O spe-
cies present in Nb2O5.
The position of the high frequency band at 984 cm1
in HREEL-spectra shown in Fig. 3 almost coincides with
that observed on the supported niobia particles
(
986 cm1, see Fig. 2) and therefore can be assigned to
Nb@O species. The comparative study strongly suggests
that both three-dimensional Nb particles on the alumina
ﬁlms and multilayer niobia ﬁlms prepared under low oxy-
gen pressure conditions (106 mbar) are in fully oxidized,
niobium (5+) oxide phase exposing Nb@O species on the
surface, i.e. like in H–Nb2O5. To some extent, these results
are in contrast with those previously observed for vanadia
model systems (both the supported vanadia and the van-
adia ﬁlms) where vanadium deposition under the same oxy-
gen
pressure
conditions
(106 mbar)
leads
to
the
formation of V2O3 particles and ﬁlms, both V@O termi-
nated. This diﬀerence can be explained by the fact that nio-
bium, in contrast to vanadium, does not form a stable
sesquioxide and therefore transforms into the Nb2O5
phase.
An IRAS study of adsorption of CO as a probe mole-
cule further supports the conclusion on the oxidation state
of Nb in the model systems. Interaction of CO with niobia
is found to be weak and can be seen only at low tempera-
tures (see Fig. 2b). The strongly blue-shifted frequency of
CO as compared to the gas phase (2191 vs 2143 cm1) im-
plies that CO is linearly adsorbed on top of Nb5+ sites
[20,34]. A similar feature at 2190 cm1 was also obtained
on the thin niobia ﬁlms (not shown here), i.e. fully consis-
tent with the above PES results.
Therefore, combined STM and IRAS studies show that
niobia deposited on thin alumina ﬁlms in an oxygen atmo-
sphere form small Nb2O5 particles terminated by the
Nb@O groups and also Nb5+ sites.
Thermal stability of the supported niobia particles was
further examined by STM and IRAS. Fig. 4 shows STM
images of the 0.5 A
˚ niobia/alumina sample after a thermal
ﬂash to elevated temperatures (500–900 K) in UHV.
Annealing to 700 K basically decreases the particle density
partially due to sintering of the particles (some particles
gain in size) and also due to niobia migration into the ﬁlm,
which is more clearly observed after annealing to 900 K. As
previously shown for other metal particles [22], the interdif-
fusion probably goes through the line defects of the alu-
mina ﬁlm, thus resulting in their decoration (see Fig. 4d).
The 2.5 A
˚ niobia/alumina sample, shown in Fig. 5a, was
ﬁrst ﬂashed in UHV to 700 K, then oxidized in 107 mbar
O2 at 400 K and ﬁnally at 900 K. One can see that, in con-
trast to annealing in UHV, ambient oxygen precludes the
migration of the niobia particles, and only partial sintering
occurs at 900 K.

Fig. 6 shows the results of a complementary IRAS study
for 2.5 A
˚ niobia/alumina sample. Initially existing Nb@O
species at 983 cm1 apparently disappear upon heating
to 700 K. Concomitantly, the broad band centered at
900 cm1 and assigned to the Nb–O–Al interface vibra-
tions, becomes sharper most probably due to a strong
attenuation of the band at 865 cm1 corresponding to the
pristine alumina ﬁlm. This eﬀect can be explained by the
onset of niobia migration as revealed by STM and dis-
cussed above. Mild oxidation at 400 K recovers the niobyl
species without aﬀecting the interface region. However, fur-
ther oxidation at 900 K shifts the interface phonon from
915 cm1 to 948 cm1 (partially overlapping with the
Nb@O band). This shift can be related to the structural
transformations of the niobia/alumina interface since the
STM results showed that overall particle morphology is
not aﬀected much by oxidation at 900 K. Note also that
this ﬁnding indirectly supports our previous assignment
of
the
900 cm1
band
to
niobia/alumina
interface
phonon.
The eﬀect of ambient oxygen on the thermal stability of
the niobia particles can be rationalized in terms of oxygen
preventing the reduction of the niobia surface and hence
migration of the Nb atoms into the ﬁlm. In addition, pre-
vious studies on the oxygen interaction with alumina sup-
ported particles showed that the metal particles may
promote thickening of the alumina ﬁlm via oxygen dissoci-
ation and subsequent diﬀusion of atomic oxygen to the alu-
mina/NiAl interface [35,36]. This in turn may also alter the
interaction of the niobia particles and the alumina ﬁlm.
4. Summary
Niobia/alumina model catalysts were prepared by phys-
ical vapor deposition of Nb in an oxygen atmosphere
(107 mbar, 300 K) onto thin well-ordered alumina ﬁlms
grown on NiAl(110). Using scanning tunneling micros-
copy and infrared reﬂection absorption spectroscopy as

recovered upon oxidation treatment. All measurements were performed at
room temperature. The spectra are oﬀset for clarity.

well as CO as a probe molecule, we have found that niobia
forms randomly dispersed N2O5 nanoparticles exposing
Nb@O and Nb5+ surface sites. The model catalysts are
fairly stable up to 700 K in vacuum and much more sta-
ble in ambient oxygen. The structural characteristics of
niobia/alumina are similar to the previously studied van-
adia/alumina system, except that vanadium (3+) forms a
sesquioxide but fully oxidized niobium (5+) pentoxide
phases are formed. Both systems primarily exhibit metal–
oxygen double bond surface terminations (Nb@O and
V@O).
