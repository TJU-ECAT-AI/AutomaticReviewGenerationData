High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)
were used to study the interaction of O2 with reduced TiO2(110)–(1×1) crystals. STM is the technique of
choice to unravel the relation between vacancy and non-vacancy assisted O2 dissociation channels as a
function of temperature. It is revealed that the vacancy-assisted, ﬁrst O2 dissociation channel is preferred at
low temperature (~120 K), whereas the non-vacancy assisted, second O2 dissociation channel operates at
temperatures higher than 150 K–180 K. Based on the STM results on the two dissociative O2 interaction
channels and the TPD data, a new comprehensive model of the O2 chemisorption on reduced TiO2(110) is
proposed. The model explains the relations between the two dissociative and the molecular O2 interaction
channels. The experimental data are interpreted by considering the available charge in the near-surface
region of reduced TiO2(110) crystals, the kinetics of the two O2 dissociation channels as well as the kinetics
of the diffusion and reaction of Ti interstitials.

1. Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a reducible transition metal oxide that is
widely used in a number of technological ﬁelds such as photocatalysis,
heterogeneous catalysis, solar cells, hydrophilic ﬁlms, gas sensors,
waste remediation, and biocompatible materials [1–8]. Among these
applications particularly in areas such as photocatalysis, photode-
gradation of organic pollutants and the photo-generation of hydro-
philic ﬁlms, the interaction of O2 with TiO2 plays an important role
[1,3,5,7,8]. For example, O2 is a common oxidant and is also used in
photocatalysis as a scavenger of the photo-excited electrons to
prevent negative charge accumulation on the surface of the catalysts
[1–3]. Furthermore, the interaction of O2 with TiO2 is interesting with
a view to the possible photodynamic therapy of cancer, where the O2
molecules play a vital role as oxidizing species [1]. To enhance the
efﬁciencies of the applications listed above, it is essential to improve
our understanding of how O2 interacts with TiO2 surfaces. The
promising applications of TiO2-based materials have spurred tremen-
dous research both in fundamental as well as in more applied ﬁelds.
In early surface science studies under ultra-high vacuum (UHV)
conditions, the interaction of molecular O2 with TiO2 single crystals was
studied most frequently using photon-stimulated desorption (PSD) and
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) [8–22]. In all these works
the rutile TiO2(110)–(1×1) surface (cf. Fig. 1), which is the most stable
surface of rutile, and which is often considered the model system for
transition-metal oxide surfaces [4,6,17,23–27], was studied. Very
valuable information has been gained by using these desorption
techniques on the O2 interaction with rutile TiO2(110)–(1×1). For
example, O2-PSD studies by the Yates group [8–10,16,17] have revealed
that the O2-PSD occurs in UHV on O2-exposed TiO2(110) very much as it
is observed on high-surface-area TiO2 powder materials [28–30]. In
addition, the thermal chemistry has been examined by Henderson and
co-workers by combining detailed TPD studies with electron energy loss
spectroscopy (EELS) measurements [12–14]. These studies disclosed
the complex nature of the O2–TiO2(110) interaction and showed that
dissociative and molecular channels co-exist on reduced TiO2(110)
crystals. The desorption of O2 at ~410 K was observed for TiO2(110)–
(1×1) samples characterized by ~8%ML (monolayer) bridging oxygen
(Obr) vacancies after O2 adsorption at temperatures lower than ~180 K
[12–14,16]. Interestingly, no sign of scrambling was found for the O2
molecules that desorb in the TPD peak centered at ~410 K neither with
the Obr atoms on the surface nor with other O2 molecules [12,15]. EELS
measurements indicated that charge is transferred from the TiO2(110)
surface to O2 molecules adsorbed at 120 K and suggested the
stabilization of a superoxo species (singly charged O2) on the surface
[12–14]. Recent low-temperature TPD studies by Dohnálek et al. [18]
and Kimmel and Petrik [20] showed that physisorbed O2 desorbs from
the TiO2(110) surface at temperatures below 100 K. Utilizing the

desorption of physisorbed O2, it is possible to distinguish between
physisorbed and chemisorbed forms of O2, and the amount of
chemisorbed O2 can be quantiﬁed using liquid He cooled samples [20].
However, based alone on desorption and other spectroscopic
techniques insights into reactions on the surface can only be deduced
indirectly, which may explain why some of the previous models of the
O2–TiO2(110) interaction are rather speculative. For example, Hen-
derson et al. suggested that O2 adsorption onto reduced TiO2(110)–
(1×1) at ~120 K would lead to the stabilization of up to three O2
molecules per Obr vacancy [12], and Kimmel and Petrik reported that
each Obr vacancy would stabilize two O2 molecules at low tempera-
tures [20]. On the other hand, STM studies by Wendt et al. reported
that the O2 molecules dissociate at Obr vacancy sites [Fig. 2(a)] even at
temperatures as low as ~120 K [26,31,32], at variance with the models
previously proposed [12,20]. By means of TPD, it is rather difﬁcult to
gather information about O2 dissociation on the reduced TiO2(110)
surface. Yet, the existence of O adatoms (Oot) on the ﬁve-fold-
coordinated Ti (5f-Ti) sites (cf. Figs. 1 and 2), created by O2
dissociation, has been inferred from TPD studies addressing the
chemistry of water and ammonia on O2-exposed TiO2(110) single
crystals [11]. The TPD peaks ascribed to the ﬁrst monolayer (ML) of
water and ammonia, respectively, were found to shift to higher
temperatures on O2-predosed TiO2(110) crystals and explained
through additional H bonds to the Oot adatoms on the surface [11].
Using a desorption technique, more direct evidence of the Oot adatoms
was found only recently by the Yates group [21]; Lee et al. used
electrons with 210 eV to stimulate the desorption of Oot adatoms and
reported that these Oot adatoms on the TiO2(110) have a very high
ionic cross section for O+ production [21].
The technique of choice to study the dissociative adsorption of O2
on reduced TiO2(110) is STM. Previous STM studies have unraveled a
surprisingly rich and complex interaction of O2 with the reduced TiO2
(110) surface [4,6,25–27,31–42]. For example, Li et al. reported the
formation of irregular networks of pseudo-hexagonal rosettes and
[001]-oriented strands on originally ﬂat TiO2(110)–(1×1) surfaces
through the oxidation of vacuum-annealed crystals at 470 K–830 K
[36]. In addition, Du et al. [39] showed that O2 dissociation at Obr
vacancy sites (the ﬁrst O2 dissociation channel) at room temperature
(RT) leads to Oot adatoms left behind in the Ti troughs that are
separated by one lattice constant along the [001] direction away from
the original Obr vacancy positions [Fig. 2(b)]. Moreover, results
obtained by our group provided evidence of a non-vacancy-assisted
O2 dissociation channel that occurs in addition to the ﬁrst, vacancy-
assisted dissociation channel [32]. Upon O2 exposure at RT, this
second O2 dissociation channel leads to the formation of paired Oot
adatoms on next-nearest 5f-Ti sites in the Ti troughs [Fig. 2(c)].
Recently, Du et al. conﬁrmed the formation of Oot adatom pairs on the
surface of reduced TiO2(110) crystals upon O2 exposure at RT [42]. The
occurrence of the second O2 dissociation channel is a strong indication
of the existence of charge donors in the near-surface region, since
without charge donation the adsorption and dissociation of O2 on TiO2
(110) is predicted to be energetically unfavorable [31,32,43–45].
The exact nature of the charge donors on the surface of reduced
TiO2(110) crystals is still an issue of ongoing research [33,44,46–56].
For a long time the prevailing opinion in the literature was that the
chemistry on reduced TiO2(110) is governed by Obr vacancies
[4,6,8,23,24,57–61]. Consequently, it was thought that the Ti3d defect
state in the band gap observed on reduced TiO2 samples
[4,12,24,48,59,60,62–64] was caused by missing surface O atoms.
However, this belief was recently disputed [32], because a number of

experimental studies provided solid evidence of the existence of Ti
interstitials
in
the
bulk
of
reduced
TiO2(110)
samples
[32,34,36,37,65–67], which could also lead to the defect state in the
band gap [50,51,68–70]. In a recent paper, we reported on valence
band spectroscopic measurements showing that the Ti3d defect state
remains almost unchanged on nearly defect-free TiO2(110) surfaces
compared to surfaces with defects, Obr vacancies and H adatoms (or
OHbr groups), respectively. Based on this and additional results we
proposed that the Ti3d defect state arises predominantly due to the
extra charge originating from Ti interstitials in the near-surface region
rather than from Obr vacancies [32]. On the contrary, two recent
studies reported that electron-donating surface defects, Obr vacancies
and H adatoms, rather than Ti interstitials control the reactivity of
TiO2(110) [53,55]. However, in both these studies TiO2(110) crystals
were irradiated with electrons in order to create additional surface
defects. Because electron irradiation does not exclusively create Obr
vacancies, but also other, unidentiﬁed defects in the near-surface
region of TiO2(110) crystals [56] the conclusions of these two studies
are debatable. Further research is needed to clearly disentangle
surface and near-surface contributions to the defect state and to
improve our understanding of the redox chemistry on the surfaces of
bulk-reduced TiO2 crystals.
In the present article we report on systematic and detailed STM
studies on the prevailing O2 dissociation channel on reduced TiO2
(110)–(1×1) as a function of the adsorption temperature. The STM
studies reveal that the second O2 dissociation channel is an activated
process requiring temperatures higher than 150 K–180 K and that the
O2 dissociation reaction on reduced TiO2(110) is self-limiting. The
STM results are supported by TPD data that allow us to directly
compare the here presented new results with previously published
spectroscopic data. The results are explained by invoking a compe-
tition between dissociative and molecular O2 interaction channels for
the electronic charge in the near-surface region, and a new model for
the interaction of molecular O2 with reduced TiO2(110) crystals is
proposed. From the STM and TPD results we infer that charge
donation from bulk defects to adsorbed oxygen species plays a crucial
role, however, the kinetics of the two O2 dissociation channels as well
as the kinetics of the diffusion and reaction of Ti interstitials must be
considered as well.
2. Experimental
The STM and TPD experiments were carried out in a UHV chamber
with a base pressure in the low 10−11 Torr range equipped with a
homebuilt, variable-temperature Aarhus STM, a quadrupole mass
spectrometer (QMS), and standard facilities for sample preparation
and characterization [71,72]. The Aarhus STM used for this study is
capable of fast scanning and high resolution in a temperature range
between 100 and 400 K. Electrochemically etched tungsten tips were
used in all the STM experiments. The differentially pumped QMS was
connected to the main chamber via a closed cone with a small
aperture (d~3 mm) facing the sample at a distance of 1 mm. The latter
ensures that only molecules released from the sample can reach the
QMS. The temperature of the sample could be varied from 100 K using
liquid nitrogen to 1200 K by heating the back side of the sample with a
ﬁlament and electron bombardment. The sample temperature was
measured using a K-type thermocouple spot-welded to the sample
plate such that the thermocouple is in direct contact with the crystal
face. Before mounting the crystals, the reliability of the temperature
measurement was checked by using liquid nitrogen as a reference.
The temperature of the sample was controlled and recorded by using
a Eurotherm temperature controller that contains an automatic
compensation of ambient temperature changes. A calibrated pyrom-
eter was used to double check the temperature of the samples during
vacuum-annealing.
To obtain clean TiO2(110) surfaces [r-TiO2(110)], the crystals were
Ar+ sputtered at RT and vacuum-annealed at 780 K–960 K several
times. A short ﬂash to ~600 K was applied when the sample reached
RT after vacuum-annealing in order to free the sample from H
adatoms that result from water adsorption during the cooling of the
sample after the 20 min anneal [31]. All the STM images presented in
this study were acquired in the constant current mode with a
tunneling voltage of ~+1.25 V and a tunneling current of ~0.1 nA.
If not stated otherwise, clean r-TiO2(110) surfaces were exposed to
O2 using a directional doser containing a 10 μm glass capillary array
disk of ~8 mm diameter [73], which was placed in front of the sample
at a distance of ~1 mm from the sample surface. When using the
directional doser, the local O2 pressure was estimated to be ~100 times
higher that the background O2 pressure [74]. The given O2 exposures in
L (Langmuir), with 1 L=1.33×10−6 mbar s, take this factor of ~100
into account. The use of a directional doser was crucial to minimize
possible contamination of the surface by water, which can be a serious
problem even for studies performed under UHV conditions [6,31,75].
Before accomplishing of the O2 exposures the clean TiO2(110) crystals
were investigated by STM at temperatures between 100 K and 140 K.
For adsorption temperatures 200 K≤T≤350 K the samples where
slowly heated to the anticipated temperatures and kept constant for at
least 2 min at these temperatures to make sure that the measured
temperatures precisely represent the temperatures of the TiO2(110)
crystals. Assuming a monotonic correlation between bulk and surface
reduction, we estimated the Obr vacancy densities in order to provide a
rough measure of the bulk reduction of the TiO2(110) crystals. All the
densities of surface species or defects are given in %ML, with 1 ML
being the density of the (1×1) unit cells, 5.2×1014/cm2.
3. Results
3.1. Combined STM and TPD data
Fig. 3 shows empty state STM images acquired from the same TiO2
(110) crystal (sample #1) at different reduction states, low- and
medium-reduced, respectively. As the crystal was low-reduced [Fig. 3
(a)], steps were running preferentially parallel to the [1–
11] and [1–
1–
1]
directions, while steps in the [001] direction occurred less frequently.
Steps running parallel to the [1–
11] and [1–
1–
1] directions are uniform
and smooth, whereas steps running parallel to the [001] direction are
often rough, as also observed in previous work [4]. When the crystal
was low-reduced, the terrace width was found to be ca. 30 Å–130 Å
and the density of Obr vacancies (2.9±0.6) %ML. In its medium-
reduced state [Fig. 3(b)], the crystal was characterized by terraces of
ca. 100 Å–160 Å width, and the density of Obr vacancies was (6.1±1.0)
%ML. The different reduction of the crystal is a consequence of both the
applied sputtering/annealing cycles (in these examples 32 and 63,
respectively) as well as the temperature of the ﬁnal anneal. When the
TiO2(110) crystal was medium-reduced, the optimal ﬁnal annealing
temperature was 50 K to 100 K higher than when the crystal was low-
reduced. When choosing the annealing temperature, the criterion was
whether or not ﬂat and well-ordered TiO2(110) surfaces with large
terraces could be achieved since such surfaces are advantageous for
the STM studies.
The predominant point defects on the terraces of sputtered and
vacuum-annealed TiO2(110)–(1×1) crystals are Obr vacancies
[4,6,27,31]. The Obr vacancies appear in the STM images as bright
protrusions within the dark rows, since the STM contrast on TiO2
(110) is dominated by electronic effects [4,6,76], leading to a reversed
contrast with the geometrically protruding Obr rows appearing dark
and the Ti troughs appearing bright. Examples of Obr vacancies are
indicated by squares in Fig. 3(c) and (d). In addition to the Obr
vacancies, we also identiﬁed a few residual H adatoms (indicated by
hexagons) in these zoom-in STM images. The H adatoms are the result
of water dissociation at Obr vacancy sites [6,14,27,31,62,77]. In the
1947
E. Lira et al. / Surface Science 604 (2010) 1945–1960
STM images acquired with the tunneling conditions used here, the H
adatoms appear as slightly brighter protrusions than the Obr vacancies
[6,27,31,75,78]. In spite of a brief ﬂash to ~600 K directly before we
started the STM experiments, the occurrence of a few H adatoms is
difﬁcult to avoid, because the r-TiO2(110) surface is inherently very
reactive towards water [6,31,75].
Fig. 4 displays two series of O2-TPD spectra for O2 adsorption at
125 K acquired on the same TiO2(110) crystal that was used in the STM

in this paper the tunneling parameters were +1.25 V and 0.1 nA. The crystal was prepared by applying 32 and 63 sputtering/annealing cycles, respectively. The annealing temperature
was initially (during the ﬁrst 14 cycles) between 760 K and 800 K (a) and ﬁnally ~900 K (b). The Obr vacancy densities obtained were ~2.9% ML (a) and ~6.1%ML (b), respectively.
Corresponding zoom-in STM images acquired within the same experiments are displayed in (c) and (d), respectively. Symbols indicate Obr vacancies (squares) and single H adatoms
(hexagon).

experiments of Fig. 3. The ﬁrst series [Fig. 4(a)] was acquired when the
crystal was in its low-reduced state, while the second series [Fig. 4(b)]
corresponds to the medium-reduced state of the crystal. After each
TPD spectrum, the crystal was again sputtered and vacuum-annealed
in order to restore a well-ordered, ﬂat r-TiO2(110) surface. Therefore,
the reduction state of the crystal varied somewhat within the two
series of TPD experiments. In spite of the different bulk-reduction of
the TiO2(110) crystal and the correspondingly different density of Obr
vacancies, the two series of O2-TPD spectra are very similar. We found
O2 molecules to desorb between ~360 K and ~450 K for all O2
exposures greater than ~0.1 L O2, and the desorption temperature
was invariant with O2 coverage to within ±5 K. In both series no O2
desorption was found for exposures smaller than ~0.1 L, and the TPD-
peak areas saturate for O2 exposures≥1 L [Fig. 4(c)]. In order to
estimate the amount of desorbing O2 from the TiO2(110) surfaces, we
performed O2 desorption experiments on Pt(111) (not shown).
Speciﬁcally, we acquired TPD spectra of the Pt(111)–(2×2)O phase
[79] to calibrate the O2-TPD spectra. Based on this calibration, we
found for the O2-TPD experiments of Fig. 4 and O2 exposures≥1 L that
only (7±2) %ML O2 are desorbing between ~360 K and ~450 K from
this TiO2(110) crystal. The main results extracted from the combined
TPD and STM studies addressing sample #1 are summarized in Table 1.
Fig. 5 shows STM images acquired on another TiO2(110) crystal
(sample #2) that was taken from the same batch as sample #1.
Comparing the preparations of samples #1 and #2, the annealing
temperature for sample #2 was throughout somewhat higher than
that used to prepare sample #1 (in average by ~60 K), while the
sputtering conditions were kept constant. As a consequence of the
higher annealing temperatures, we obtained a well-ordered r-TiO2
(110) surface characterized by large terraces after applying only 14
sputter/anneal cycles [Fig. 5(a)]. Likewise, the density of Obr vacancies
increased faster on sample #2 than on sample #1. After additional 24
sputter/anneal cycles and a further increase of the annealing
temperature (from ~860 K at the 14th cycle to ~920 K at the 38th
cycle), the terraces became even larger [Fig. 5(b)]. The surface of this
medium-reduced TiO2(110) crystal was characterized by terraces of
ca. 160 Å–250 Å widths and by a density of Obr vacancies of ~8.3%ML.
Fig. 6 shows two O2-TPD spectra acquired from sample #2 when it
was in a medium-reduced reduction state and where we found the O2
desorption to be at a maximum. The amount of desorbing O2 from
sample #2 was clearly larger than on sample #1. Speciﬁcally, we
found that at maximum (40±15) %ML O2 are desorbing from sample
#2, which is about a factor of six more than what we observed at
maximum when working with sample #1. Note that the exposures
used in the experiments performed with sample #2 (20 L to 100 L)
were certainly high enough to saturate the O2-desorption peak at
~410 K. In addition, the O2-TPD spectra obtained on sample #2 show a
ﬁne structure that was not observed for sample #1. The main
desorption peak was found at ~412 K, but a shoulder at ~386 K is also
evident in the spectra corresponding to this crystal. Furthermore, we
found that some O2 molecules desorb from sample #2 at very low
temperatures (LT) shortly after starting the temperature ramp. The
LT-O2-desorption may reach a maximum at ~175 K under our
experimental conditions; however, it is noteworthy that O2 molecules
desorbed from the surface throughout the whole temperature range
between ~150 K and ~360 K before the main desorption sets in. Such
LT-O2-desorption was not clearly evident in the O2-TPD spectra
acquired on sample #1. The following STM studies were performed on
a number of TiO2(110) crystals that were prepared similarly as sample
#2.
3.2. STM data obtained on oxidized TiO2(110) surfaces
3.2.1. O2 dissociation at low temperatures (100 K≤T≤150 K)
We now turn to our STM data addressing the interaction of O2 with
r-TiO2(110) surfaces at temperatures ranging from 100 K to 150 K, i.e.
conditions for which the adsorption of O2 molecules can be expected,
based on the above TPD results. Fig. 7 shows STM results obtained on a
medium-reduced TiO2(110) crystal (Obr vacancy density ~8.2%ML)
that was exposed to 50 L O2 at 120 K. New protrusions appeared in the
Ti troughs (indicated by circles) after the O2 exposure, cf. Figs. 7(a)
and (b). Based on previous studies we assign these protrusions to Oot
adatoms [6,31,32,39,42,64]. However, in this and many other STM
images obtained after similar preparations we did not ﬁnd any
protrusions or depressions that could be ascribed to adsorbed O2
molecules. Instead, we identiﬁed Oot adatoms and residual Obr
vacancies after the O2 exposure. Below it will become clear that O2
molecules are also adsorbed on the TiO2(110) surface, as expected,
but that they are invisible in the STM images.
Counting the surface species identiﬁed in the STM data sets
acquired before and after the O2 exposure reveals that the total
density of Obr vacancies and Oot adatoms obtained after the O2
exposure is very similar to the density of Obr vacancies before the O2
exposure [cf. Fig. 7(c) and Table 2]. This analysis conﬁrms previous
results obtained by our group, namely that the identiﬁed Oot adatoms
in the experiments with the O2 exposure performed at temperatures
lower than ~150 K stem from O2 dissociation at Obr vacancy sites
[31,32], i.e. from the ﬁrst O2 dissociation channel. We repeated the
experiment of the same type as shown in Fig. 7 several times on
various TiO2(110) samples under similar conditions (cf. also Fig. 8 and
Table 2). Only for O2 adsorption in the LT range, 100 K≤T≤150 K, we
found Obr vacancies/Oot adatoms-ratios close to 1:1. In the following,
we denote TiO2(110) surfaces prepared at 100 K≤T≤150 K as o-TiO2
(110) surfaces.
Fig. 8 and Table 2 display the results of three further O2 adsorption
experiments where we exposed r-TiO2(110) surfaces to O2 at LT. In the
ﬁrst experiment, a low-reduced TiO2(110) crystal with an Obr vacancy
density of ~4.4%ML was exposed to 5 L O2 at ~109 K [Fig. 8(a)]. In the
second experiment, a r-TiO2(110) surface characterized by an Obr
vacancy density of ~7.5%ML was exposed to 25 L O2 at ~142 K [Fig. 8(b)].
In the third experiment, a r-TiO2(110) surface characterized by an Obr
vacancy density of ~9.9%ML was exposed to 10 L O2 at ~128 K [Fig. 8(c)].
The STM results summarized in Fig. 8 further conﬁrm that part of the
impinging O2 molecules dissociate at Obr vacancy sites at
100 K≤T≤150 K. However, not all the Obr vacancies are healed through
O2 dissociation at vacancy sites. On a low-reduced TiO2(110) crystal
(~4.4%ML Obr vacancy density) ~5% of the Obr vacancies remained
unﬁlled on the surface after 5 L O2 exposure at ~109 K, as revealed by
our analysis [cf. Fig. 8(d) and Table 2]. On TiO2(110) crystals
characterized by Obr vacancy densities greater than ~5%ML we found
always unﬁlled Obr vacancies irrespective of the O2 exposure. For
example, ~10% of the Obr vacancies remained unﬁlled on the TiO2(110)
crystal with an Obr vacancy density of ~7.5%ML [cf. Fig. 8(e)], although
this crystal was exposed to25 L O2. In several additional experiments we
experienced that it becomes increasingly more difﬁcult to heal all the
Obr vacancies the more reduced the TiO2(110) crystals are. In the
example shown in Fig. 8(c) ~12.1% of the Obr vacancies remained

Summary of estimated Obr vacancy densities, the terrace widths and integrated O2-TPD
areas corresponding to a TiO2(110) crystal in different reduction states (sample #1),
and of a second TiO2(110) crystal (sample #2), where the annealing temperature was
throughout higher compared with sample #1. For the Obr vacancy densities, the given
error bars result from the slightly changed reduction states of the crystals within the
course of the experiments and not from the statistical error, which was much smaller.
For the integrated O2-TPD areas, the given error bars result essentially from the
uncertainty regarding the desorbing oxygen from the Pt(111)–(2×2)O phase, i.e. from
our reference.

vacancy density of ~9.9%ML [cf. Fig. 8(f)].
3.2.2. Temperature dependence of O2 dissociation
Fig. 9 and Table 3 show our STM results addressing the temperature
dependence of the O2 dissociation reaction on low-reduced TiO2(110)
crystals with Obr vacancy densities between 4 and 6%ML. In each
experiment within this series a TiO2(110) crystal was exposed to 2 L
O2, and the chosen adsorption temperatures were 200 K, 250 K, 293 K,
and 350 K, respectively [Fig. 9(a)–(d)]. In Table 3 and in the following
we denote the Oot adatoms on next-nearest 5f-Ti sites as p(2)-Oot
adatoms, and the single Oot adatoms are denoted as s-Oot. The
given counts in Table 3 and at any other place in the manuscript refer
to the number of Oot adatoms (not to the number of pairs), regardless
whether the Oot adatoms occur isolated or within the p(2)-Oot pairs.
Between ~1.7%ML (200 K) and ~5.2%ML (350 K) Oot adatoms were
found on the TiO2(110) surface after the 2 L O2 exposure [Fig. 9(e)–(h)].
For O2 adsorption at 200 K [Fig. 9(a)], the density of Oot adatoms in p
(2)-Oot pairs amounts to only ~0.2%ML (~12% of the total density of Oot
adatoms), and the total density of Obr vacancies and Oot adatoms is only
little larger than the density of Obr vacancies before the O2 exposure.
With the exception of the small density of Oot adatoms in the p(2)-Oot
pairs, the situation after O2 adsorption at 200 K is reminiscent to the LT-
case(100 K≤T≤150 K)discussed above. ForO2 adsorption at 250 K and
293 K [Fig. 9(b) and (c)], the density of Oot adatoms in p(2)-Oot pairs
amounts to ~0.7%ML (~30% of the total density of Oot adatoms) and
~1.2%ML (~32% of the total density of Oot adatoms), respectively. In
Fig. 5. STM images of clean r-TiO2(110) surfaces acquired from the same crystal (sample #2) in different reduction states. The crystal was prepared by applying 14 and 38 sputtering/
annealing cycles, respectively. The annealing temperature was initially ~860 K (a) and ﬁnally ~920 K (b). The Obr vacancy densities obtained were ~6.3%ML (a) and ~8.3%ML
(b), respectively. Corresponding zoom-in STM images acquired within the same experiments are displayed in (c) and (d), respectively. Symbols indicate Obr vacancies (squares) and
single H adatoms (hexagon).

these latter two cases the total densities of Obr vacancies and Oot
adatoms after the O2 exposures exceed the densities of Obr vacancies
before the exposures by ~0.7%ML and ~0.9%ML, respectively. These
values are close to the densities of Oot adatoms in the p(2)-Oot pairs,
~0.7%ML and ~1.2%ML, respectively. A peculiarity seems to exist at
350 K [Fig. 9(d)], because for this adsorption temperature the density of
Oot adatoms in p(2)-Oot pairs is smaller as compared to the situation at
293 K (~0.7% ML versus ~1.2% ML). However, after the O2 exposure at
350 K we obtained an unusually high density of Oot adatoms with three
lattice distances to each other, namely 1.4%ML, which is ~27% of thetotal
density of Oot adatoms. In the following we denote the pairs of Oot
adatoms with three lattice distances to each other as p(3)-Oot pairs. For
O2 adsorption at350 K thetotal densityof Obrvacancies and Oot adatoms
after the O2 exposure exceeds the density of Obr vacancies before the
exposure by about the sum of the Oot adatom-densities in the p(2)-Oot
and the p(3)-Oot pairs. Clearly more O2 molecules dissociate at 350 K
than at the lower adsorption temperatures.
Next, we describe our results obtained after 2 L O2 exposure at
200 K to a medium-reduced TiO2(110) crystal that was characterized
by an Obr vacancy density of ~8.3%ML (Fig. 10, Table 3). The
motivation of this experiment was to test whether the temperature
dependence of the O2 dissociation reaction as obtained on low-
reduced TiO2(110) crystals is also valid for more strongly reduced
TiO2(110) crystals. After O2 exposure at 200 K we found ~4.4%ML Oot
adatoms (total density) and ~4.8%ML unﬁlled Obr vacancies. Thus, on
the medium-reduced TiO2(110) crystal we found a higher density of
Oot adatoms than on the low-reduced TiO2(110) crystal, where we
obtained solely ~1.7%ML Oot adatoms after the same O2 exposure. On
the medium-reduced TiO2(110) crystal [Fig. 10(c)], the total density
of Obr vacancies and Oot adatoms exceeds the density of Obr vacancies
before the O2 exposure by ~0.9%ML, which equals the density of Oot
adatoms occurring in p(2)-Oot pairs. Comparing this result with the
situation found on the low-reduced TiO2(110) crystal [cf. Fig. 9(a) and
(e)], clearly more Oot adatoms occur in p(2)-Oot pairs on the medium-
reduced TiO2(110) crystal than on the low-reduced crystal (~0.9%ML
versus ~0.2%ML).
3.2.3. Heating of o-TiO2(110) surfaces
In Fig. 11 and Table 4 we summarize the results of a series of STM
measurements performed after the following preparations: (i) Clean

ﬁnal annealing at 910 K for 20 min. This surface was characterized by

areas, which established a very solid basis to assess whether the analyzed areas were indeed representative.

The surface as characterized by the STM image shown in (d) after ﬁnal
annealing at 550 K, again for 120 s [cf. Fig. 11(e)]. As expected from
the STM data presented above, we found after the O2 exposure at
120 K a density of Oot adatoms about as high as the density of Obr
vacancies before the exposure [cf. Fig. 11(f)]. However, after brief
annealing of the sample at 393 K we found an enhanced density of Oot
adatoms on the surface [cf. Fig. 11(c) and (f)]. Speciﬁcally, we found
an Oot density ca. twice as high as found directly after the O2 exposure
at 120 K. In addition, small islands with STM heights of ~2.2 Å
appeared on the terraces (indicated by circles). These TiOx islands are
the result of Ti interstitial diffusion toward the surface and their
reaction with Oot adatoms [32,41]. After annealing at even higher
temperatures, the density of Oot adatoms decreases, and ﬁnally goes
to zero [cf. Fig. 11(d), (e) and (f)], and the density of TiOx islands
increases simultaneously. Comparing the surface morphologies after
annealing at 480 K and 550 K, it appears that some of the TiOx islands
have agglomerated after annealing at 550 K. This explains why the
density of the TiOx islands has slightly decreased after brief annealing
at 550 K. A detailed analysis of the STM images depicted in Fig. 11(d)
and (e) reveals that at least three different types of TiOx islands exist
on the terraces, and that the islands are distributed over the whole
surface. The TiOx islands remain on the surface even after annealing at
higher temperatures than was done in the experiment of Fig. 11 (not
shown), and we experienced that sputtering/annealing of the crystal
is required to recreate a TiO2(110) surface with ﬂat terraces after an
experiment of this type was performed. We ﬁnally note that a low
density of Obr vacancies was also evident in the STM images after
annealing at 550 K [cf. Fig. 11(e) and (f)].
4. Discussion
4.1. TPD results
The O2-TPD data presented in Figs. 4 and 6 are in good agreement
with previously published data showing O2 desorption peaking at
~410 K from sputtered and vacuum-annealed TiO2(110) crystals
[12,14,16,20]. As in the previous studies we found the O2 desorption
temperature to be invariant with O2 coverage to within ±5 K,
suggesting ﬁrst-order desorption kinetics rather than second-order
O atom recombination kinetics. Furthermore, we observed O2
desorption in the LT range directly after starting the temperature
ramp very similar as has been observed by other groups [12,16,22].
Based on these similarities we anticipate that our sample preparations
and experimental conditions are comparable to those of previous O2
desorption studies on reduced TiO2(110) crystals.
A more detailed comparison of our TPD results to previously
published data reveals that the O2-TPD spectra acquired when using
sample #1 (cf. Fig. 4) resemble the spectra published by Kimmel and
Petrik [20]. Both the line shape of the O2-TPD spectra and the
estimated amount of desorbing O2 reported in [20] are very similar to
our TPD data collected from sample #1. On the other hand, the O2-TPD
spectra displayed in Fig. 6, that were collected from sample #2,
resemble the TPD spectra previously published by Henderson et al.
[12]. In Ref. [12] some of the O2-TPD spectra also showed a shoulder
on the low-temperature tail. Since the amount of desorbing O2 from
sample #2 was much larger than on sample #1 (cf. Table 1), our data
clearly reveal a crucial role of the sample preparation for the O2-TPD
peak at ~410 K. This ﬁnding may explain the discrepancy regarding

the amount of desorbing O2 at ~410 K in the studies by Henderson et
al. [12] and by Kimmel and Petrik [20].
It is indeed not only the preparation procedure directly before
recording an O2-TPD spectrum, but instead the whole sample history
that determines the TPD line-shape and the amount of desorbing O2.
Once an O2-TPD spectrum with a single peak at ~410 K [cf. Fig. 4] was
obtained for a certain crystal, then all of the following O2-TPD spectra
collected from this crystal were also dominated by a single peak at
~410 K. Generally, we ﬁnd that the O2-TPD spectra presented in Fig. 4
are typical for TiO2(110) crystals that were annealed at relatively low
temperatures (initial annealing temperature ~780 K) and that are
characterized by small terraces, whereas the O2-TPD spectra pre-
sented in Fig. 6 are typical for TiO2(110) crystals that were annealed
throughout at higher temperatures and that are characterized by
larger terraces. Clearly more O2 desorbs at ~410 K from the TiO2(110)
crystals with large terraces (as typically used in our STM studies)
compared to crystals characterized by small terraces. In addition to
the temperature upon annealing, it also plays a role how often the
TiO2(110) crystals were exposed to oxygen. TiO2(110) crystals that
were often exposed to O2 tend to have small terraces, and the O2-TPD
peak obtained on such samples is quite small. The fact that the amount
of desorbing O2 at ~410 K and the line shape of the TPD spectra
depend on the sample history raises questions about the previously
proposed models for the O2-TiO2(110) interaction. If the O2 molecules

graphs of estimated densities of Obr vacancies and Oot adatoms, respectively, in %ML before (left) and after O2 exposure (right) are shown beneath the selected STM images in (e) to

were stabilized on reduced TiO2(110) crystals solely through surface
defects as previously proposed [12,14,20], the sample history is not
expected to play a decisive role.
In addition, the two series of O2-TPD spectra presented in Fig. 4
reveal that the density of Obr vacancies is not decisive for the O2
desorption at ~410 K (cf. Table 1). According to the previous models
where the O2 molecules are thought to be stabilized at Obr vacancies
[12,14,20], the maximum amount of desorbing O2 molecules at
~410 K is expected to scale with the density of Obr vacancies.
However, even though the Obr vacancy densities corresponding to
the two series of O2-TPD spectra displayed in Fig. 4 differed by a factor
of two, we found very similar amounts of desorbing O2 [cf. Fig. 4(c)].

Therefore, the TPD and STM data presented in Figs. 3 and 4 are at
variance with these previously proposed models of the O2-TiO2(110)
interaction that are based on an O vacancy model and where the Obr
vacancies are considered as the main charge donors.
4.2. STM results
4.2.1. O2 adsorption at 100 K≤T≤150 K on low-reduced TiO2(110)
crystals
Considering the STM results for adsorption temperatures between
100 K and 150 K on low-reduced TiO2(110) crystals [cf. Figs. 8(a,d) and
11(a,b,f) the following picture emerges: Most of the Obr vacancies are
healed after an O2 exposure of 5 L to low-reduced TiO2(110) crystals and
only ~0.2%ML Obr vacancies are not healed, i.e. less than 5% of the Obr
vacancies. The healing of the Obr vacancies occurs through the vacancy
assisted, ﬁrst O2 dissociation channel. For each healed Obr vacancy one
Oot adatom is created in the Ti trough because, at the low temperatures,
the Oot adatoms cannot diffuse to other Obr vacancies. For tempera-
tures≤150 K it is likely that the created Oot adatoms occupy predom-
inantly the5f-Tisites right nextto thehealed Obr vacancy[cf.Fig. 2(a)],as
was previously observed in an STM movie acquired at ~135 K [31].
In addition to the dissociative O2 adsorption at Obr vacancies, O2
molecules are also adsorbed on the low-reduced TiO2(110) crystals
after 5 L O2 exposure at 120 K. This is directly evident from the TPD
data [cf. Fig. 4]. Additionally, the STM data presented in Fig. 11
strongly support this conclusion, since after brief annealing of the
sample at 393 K the density of Oot adatoms on the surface was more
than twice as high as found directly after the O2 exposure at 120 K [cf.
Fig. 11(b,c,f)]. Thus, in case of the STM experiment described in Fig. 11
at least ~4.6%ML Oot adatoms and ~2.5%ML O2 molecules were
chemisorbed on the TiO2(110) surface at 120 K. Note that this is a
lower limit since the O2 molecules desorbing at ~410 K and Oot
adatoms that are incorporated in the TiOx islands are not considered
in this estimation.
It is known from density functional theory (DFT) studies that
electronic charge transfer to the adsorbates is required to chemisorb
Oot adatoms and O2 molecules on the TiO2(110) surface [31,32,43–45].
Otherwise, the chemisorption of oxygen species on TiO2(110) surfaces
is endothermic [31,32,43–45]. According to a Bader charge analysis
reported in [32], a molecularly adsorbed O2 species withdraws ~0.9 e−
from the TiO2(110) substrate, whereas an Oot adatom withdraws
~0.8 e−. In principle, this charge can be provided both from the Obr
vacancies and from the charge donors in the near-surface region.
However, most of the Obr vacancies are healed upon O2 exposure at
adsorption temperatures 100 K≤T≤150 K on low-reduced TiO2(110)
crystals. Therefore, the Obr vacancies can be ruled out as being the main
charge donors for the adsorbates, Oot adatoms and O2 molecules,
respectively. The STM data acquired on low-reduced TiO2(110)
crystals thus suggest that Oot adatoms and O2 molecules withdraw
electronic charge predominantly from the near-surface region.
4.2.2. O2 adsorption at 100 K≤T≤150 K on medium-reduced TiO2(110)
crystals
For medium-reduced TiO2(110) crystals, adsorption temperatures
100 K≤T≤150 K and O2 exposures of 25 and 50 L, respectively, we
found that 0.6–0.8%ML Obr vacancies were not healed, i.e. 8–10% of the
Obr vacancies [cf. Figs. 7 and 8(b,e)]. This result is remarkable,
considering the high O2 exposures used, 25 L and 50 L, respectively.
On medium-reduced TiO2(110) crystals always some of the Obr
vacancies remained unﬁlled regardless of the O2 exposure. Assuming
that charge can be transferred along the [001] direction over distances
up to ~12 Å [52], the Oot adatoms and O2 molecules can withdraw the
charge of residual unﬁlled Obr vacancies. However, the total charge of
the residual unﬁlled Obr vacancies is by far not sufﬁcient for
the chemisorption of ~7%ML Oot adatoms [cf. Figs. 7 and 8(b,e)] and
(40±15)%ML O2 molecules [cf. Table 1]. From an estimation for which
we use the aforementioned Bader charges of the oxygen adsorbates
and assume that each Obr vacancy provides its formal charge, 2 e−, it
follows that at most 7% of the total charge needed to chemisorb ~7.0%
ML Oot adatoms and (40±15)%ML O2 molecules can be provided by
the residual unﬁlled Obr vacancies, ~0.7%ML. Therefore, the STM
results obtained on medium-reduced TiO2(110) crystals likewise
suggest that most of the electronic charge withdrawn by the oxygen
adsorbates stems from charge donors in the near-surface region.
Based on our estimation, we conclude that more than 90% of the
electronic charge must be provided from charge donors in the near-
surface region. Note that the O2 molecules that dissociate upon
heating (cf. Fig. 11 and [41]) and which thus do not desorb at ~410 K
are not considered in our estimation.
4.2.3. O2 dissociation at intermediate temperatures: 150 K≤T≤350 K
The data presented in Figs. 9, 10 and Table 3 complete our picture
of the O2-TiO2(110) interaction, since they provide information about
the onset of the second O2 dissociation channel on low- and medium-
reduced TiO2(110) crystals. In addition, the STM data depicted in Fig. 9
reveal an interesting temperature dependence of both O2 dissociation
channels.
For a 2 L O2 exposure onto the low-reduced TiO2(110) crystal at
200 K [cf. Fig. 9(a,e)] the situation is still comparable to the LT-case
(100 K≤T≤150 K). The majority of the Oot adatoms are isolated and
only a few Oot adatoms appeared in the p(2)-Oot pairs. However,
clearly more O2 molecules dissociate in the Ti troughs at the higher
adsorption temperatures [cf. Fig. 9(f)–(h)]. By extrapolating to zero
coverage of p(2)-Oot pairs, we estimate that the second O2
dissociation channel sets in on the low-reduced TiO2(110) crystals
at ~180 K.
Comparing this result for low-reduced TiO2(110) crystals with the
situation found for the medium-reduced TiO2(110) crystal after
identical O2 exposure [cf. Fig. 10(c)], we ﬁnd that the second O2
dissociation channel sets in on medium-reduced TiO2(110) crystals at
lower temperatures than on low-reduced crystals. Taking into
consideration that no p(2)-Oot pairs were evident in the experiment
summarized in Fig. 8(b) and (e), where a similarly reduced TiO2(110)
crystal was exposed to 25 L O2 at ~142 K, we can conclude that the
second O2 dissociation channel sets in on medium-reduced TiO2(110)
crystals between ~142 K and ~180 K. In light of the rather large
density of Oot adatoms in p(2)-Oot pairs obtained on the medium-
reduced TiO2(110) crystal after O2 exposure at 200 K (~0.9% ML), we
speculate that the second O2 dissociation channel sets in on medium-

reduced TiO2(110) crystals at temperatures in the lower end of the
~142 K to ~180 K range.
To explain the different onsets of the p(2)-Oot pair formation on low-
and medium-reduced TiO2(110) crystals we refer to the DFT results
addressing the second O2 dissociation channel published in Ref. [32].
According to these DFT calculations it is expected that the onset of the
second O2 dissociation channel depends on the bulk-reduction of the
TiO2(110) crystals. Because more strongly reduced TiO2(110) crystals
contain more extra charge than low-reduced crystals, the barrier for O2
dissociation in the Ti troughs should be lower on the medium-reduced
TiO2(110) crystals. Hence, the onset of the second O2 dissociation
channel is expected to occur at lower temperatures on the medium-
reduced TiO2(110) crystals than on low-reduced ones, in excellent
agreement with the experimental results. Thus, the STM data depicted
in Figs. 9 and 10 are in accord with Ref. [32] and further support our
assertion that the chemisorbed oxygen species on r-TiO2(110) surfaces
essentially withdraw electronic charge from the near-surface region.
The measured temperature dependence of the O2 dissociation
reaction on low-reduced TiO2(110) crystals (Fig. 9 and Table 3) shows
that the higher the temperature is, the more O2 molecules dissociate,
i.e. the sticking coefﬁcient for dissociative adsorption increases with
temperature. It can be seen from our analysis that both O2 dissociation
channels contribute to the higher total densities of Oot adatoms at the
high adsorption temperatures. Regarding the second O2 dissociation
channel, the results corresponding to adsorption temperatures of
250 K and 293 K, respectively, can be interpreted straightforwardly,
i.e. the densities of Oot adatoms in p(2)-Oot pairs can be directly
correlated with this channel. Solely the results obtained for 350 K
adsorption temperature [cf. Fig. 9(d) and (h)] require an interpreta-
tion, since in this case the density of Oot adatoms in p(2)-Oot pairs is
relatively low, but we found an unusual high density of Oot adatoms in
p(3)-Oot pairs [cf. Fig. 2(d)]. At 350 K, the surface vibrates more than
at RT where p(2)-Oot pair formation is predominant [32,42].
Therefore, it is likely that the identiﬁed p(3)-Oot pairs have also
been formed through the second O2 dissociation channel.
In addition to the enhanced second O2 dissociation channel as a
function of adsorption temperature, the results summarized in Fig. 9
show an enhanced density of isolated Oot adatoms (s-Oot). To explain
this result we propose that an impinging O2 molecule solely
dissociates at an Obr vacancy site if it directly hits the Obr vacancy
(Langmuirian adsorption). In this model a zone around the Obr
vacancy exists within which an impinging O2 molecule dissociates,
whereas all other O2 molecules outside of the zone are repelled. With
increasing adsorption temperatures the dissociation zone becomes
larger because of the higher thermal energy of the surface. This model
infers the existence of large O2 diffusion barriers for hops into the Obr
vacancy. Nevertheless, this model is tempting, because it also offers a
possible explanation why the O2 molecules dissociate at Obr vacancy
sites even at low temperatures such as 120 K.
4.3. A new explanation of the O2-TPD peak at 410 K
Based on the discussed STM and TPD results it is now possible to
achieve an improved understanding of the thermally activated
reactions occurring upon heating of o-TiO2(110) surfaces. The
schematic diagram displayed in Fig. 12 summarizes the various
interaction channels, as they may occur after O2 adsorption between
100 K and 150 K onto bulk-reduced TiO2(110) crystals. Upon O2
exposure at temperatures in this range the majority of the Obr
vacancies are healed through the ﬁrst O2 dissociation channel. In the
diagram, the blue area represents the ﬁlled Obr vacancies and the light
yellow area the Oot adatoms. In addition to Oot formation and Obr
vacancy ﬁlling, also O2 molecules stabilize on the surface upon O2
exposure at LT (cf. Fig. 13); in the diagram displayed in Fig. 12 these
O2 molecules are represented by the gray (light-red) area.
Upon heating of o-TiO2(110) surfaces some of the O2 molecules in
the Ti troughs dissociate [cf. the hatched light-gray (yellow) area in
Fig. 12]. According to the STM results presented in Figs. 9–11 this
second O2 dissociation channel occurs between ~150 K and ~400 K,
causing the consumption of O2 molecules in this temperature range.
Whereas the dissociation of O2 molecules in the Ti troughs (second
channel) sets in between 150 K and 180 K (cf. Figs. 9 and 10), clearly
higher temperatures are required for the diffusion of Ti interstitials
towards the surface [32,36,41,65,66]. According to a recent study by
Zhang et al. [41], out-diffusion of Ti interstitials from the bulk to the
surface is hindered by a barrier of ~1 eV and sets in between 360 K
and 400 K. Thus, upon heating of o-TiO2(110) surfaces to tempera-
tures in this range, Ti interstitials start to diffuse towards the surface,
where they react with Oot adatoms (and possibly also with the O2
molecules) and form small TiOx islands on the terraces (cf. Fig. 11). In
Fig. 12. Schematic diagram illustrating the fate of the chemisorbed oxygen species, O2
molecules and Oot adatoms, on sputtered and vacuum-annealed TiO2(110) crystals for
O2 adsorption at 100 K–150 K. Two dissociative interaction channels exist, one of which
is vacancy-assisted [medium-gray (blue) and light-gray (light-yellow) areas], and the
other is not assisted by Obr vacancies [hatched light-gray (light-yellow) area]. Some of
the O2 molecules [gray (light-red) area] dissociate, and non-dissociated O2 desorbs at
~410 K. TiOx islands [dark-gray (orange) area] form on the terraces due to out-diffusion
of Ti interstitials that react with the Oot adatoms. In cases where all the adsorbed O2
molecules have dissociated before the diffusion and reaction of Ti interstitials sets in, no
O2 molecules desorb at ~410 K.
Fig. 13. Schematic diagram illustrating the main difference between O2 chemisorption
at ~100 K (a) and 300 K (b) on the surface of reduced TiO2(110) crystals.
1956
E. Lira et al. / Surface Science 604 (2010) 1945–1960
this way the Oot adatoms are incorporated into the surface. The onset
of TiOx island formation and the onset of O2 desorption occur both at
~360 K. This suggests that a correlation exists between the diffusion of
Ti interstitials and desorption of O2 molecules.
Because the out-diffusing Ti interstitials react with the Oot
adatoms, a Ti interstitial depletion layer forms in the near-surface
region upon heating of an o-TiO2(110) surface to temperatures
between ~360 K and ~400 K [41]. In valence band spectra measured
after brief annealing of an o-TiO2(110) surface at ~400 K we did not
observe a sign of reduction [32], and therefore we believe that the TiOx
islands formed at these temperatures are predominantly stoichio-
metric. Electronically, the formation of a Ti interstitial depletion layer
implies that the near-surface region is lacking electronic charge.
Therefore we propose that the O2 desorption centered at ~410 K is
driven by the lack of electronic charge rather than by thermally
activated bond breaking between the molecules and the surface, as
usually probed in TPD experiments. In this model, the O2 desorption
peak at ~410 K originates from the residual O2 molecules that did not
dissociate upon heating (cf. Fig. 12). This “lack-of-charge-model”
naturally explains why the desorbing O2 molecules do not scramble
with the Obr atoms on the surface nor with other adsorbed O2
molecules, as reported previously [12,15].
To better understand the O2 interaction with reduced TiO2(110)
crystals it is instructive to consider the charges of theoxygen adsorbates,
~0.9 e−per adsorbed O2 molecule and ~0.8 e−per Oot adatom,
respectively [32]. Based on these charges and the new insights into
the two O2 dissociation channels, it becomes apparent why the O2
desorption peak observed at ~410 K is only evident after exposing
reduced TiO2(110) crystals to O2 at LT (cf. Figs. 13 and 14). For
temperatures higher than 150 K–180 K, impinging O2 molecules can
overcome the dissociation barrier, even without Obr vacancies nearby,
and thus the accumulation of O2 molecules, if any, is small. The
dissociating O2 molecules lead to a strong charge depletion of the
electron donors in the bulk, and, thus, postexposure with O2 at LT does
not lead to the stabilization of O2 molecules [12,18]. However, for
temperatures lower than 150 K–180 K the impinging O2 molecules
cannot overcome the dissociation barrier. Therefore, O2 molecules
accumulate on the cooled TiO2(110) surface until all theavailablecharge
is withdrawn from the substrate. This model is fully consistent with the
strong dependence of the O2 desorption at ~410 K on the adsorption
temperature (cf. Fig. 14). In excellent agreement with previous results
by Henderson et al. [12] we found that O2 desorption at ~410 K is high at
low adsorption temperatures such as 115 K but decreases dramatically
as the adsorption temperature is raised to ~160 K. No O2 desorbs for
adsorption temperatures higher than ~180 K.
Considering the charges of the oxygen species, ~0.9 e−per O2
molecule and ~0.8 e−per Oot adatom [32], it follows that the total
number of “O's” in the oxygen adsorbates can be almost twice as high at
low adsorption temperature compared to the RT-case where exclusively
Oot adatoms can be stabilized on the TiO2(110) surface (cf. Fig. 13).
When heatingreduced TiO2(110) crystals thatwere saturated withO2 at
LT, the dissociation of O2 is not only hindered by the adsorption kinetics
but is also hindered by the lack of charge, because two Oot adatoms
withdraw almost twice as much charge as one O2 molecule, and most of
the charge has been withdrawn already upon adsorption. Upon heating
of the sample some of the O2 molecules dissociate, as is evident from the
occurrence of neighboring Oot adatoms [41]. Since the newly formed Oot
adatoms withdraw more charge than the O2 molecules did before their
dissociation it can be understood why a portion of the O2 molecules
desorbs already at temperatures much lower than those required for the
diffusion of Ti interstitials. Note that electronic charge is scarce on the
surface in case of O2 saturation at LT. Thus, the “lack-of-charge-model”
also offers an explanation for the O2 desorption observed between 140 K
and 360 K [cf. Fig. 6] that has also been observed in previous studies
[12,16,22] but whose origin was hitherto elusive.
Upon heating the crystal to higher temperatures, the characteristic
O2 desorption peak at ~410 K occurs when the diffusion of Ti
interstitials towards the surface sets in and an interstitial depletion
layer forms in the near-surface region [cf. Fig. 12]. In this O2
desorption peak all the residual intact O2 molecules desorb into the
gas phase (note that the broad O2 desorption background occasionally
observed at low temperatures is not considered in Fig. 12.). Due to the
rapid diffusion and reaction of Ti interstitials for temperatures higher
than ~360 K, the remaining intact O2 molecules suddenly face a
stoichiometric surface layer that does not provide sufﬁcient extra
charge. Within this “lack-of-charge-model” it becomes clear why the
position of this TPD peak is almost completely invariant with respect
to the coverage, cf. Figs. 4, 6, 14 and [12,16,20]. Because the diffusion

of Ti interstitials towards the surface is nearly a ﬁrst order kinetic
process [41], the TPD peak centered at ~410 K obeys ﬁrst order
kinetics as well.
4.4. Comparison with literature
The presented TPD and STM data addressing the O2 interaction
with low- and medium-reduced TiO2(110)−(1×1) crystals are
consistent with our previous combined high-resolution STM, photo-
electron spectroscopy and DFT study where we proposed that Ti
interstitials in the near-surface region are largely responsible for the
defect state in the band gap and that these donor speciﬁc sites enable
the adsorption of electronegative adsorbates such as O2 molecules and
Oot adatoms on the surface [32]. The TPD and STM data are also
consistent with a recent resonant photoelectron diffraction study by
Krüger et al. where it was shown that the defect charge on sputtered
and annealed TiO2(110)–(1×1) crystals is shared by several regular
surface and subsurface Ti sites, and further that the defect charge
distribution is inhomogeneous with a dominant contribution on the
subsurface Ti ions beneath the row of 5f-Ti ions [46]. In agreement
with EELS data by Henderson et al. [12] we anticipate that the more
Oot adatoms and O2 molecules can be chemisorbed on the TiO2(110)
surface the more defect charge is available in the near-surface region,
i.e. the larger the Ti3d defect state is. Based on the STM data obtained
after O2 exposure at LT we can conclude with certainty that the
electronic charge stems predominantly from the near-surface region.
Thus, irrespective of the exact nature of the charge donors in the near-
surface region, their excess-charge needs to be considered when
interpreting and modeling redox reactions on the surfaces of bulk-
reduced TiO2 crystals. This conclusion is consistent with previous
surface science studies addressing adsorbates on the TiO2(110)
surface, cf. [36–38,45,50,80,81].
Presently, it is not known whether a preference exists for one of
the two chemisorption channels, dissociatively or molecularly,
respectively, upon O2 exposure at temperatures between 100 K and
150 K onto bulk-reduced TiO2(110) crystals. However, the fact that O2
molecules can be desorbed from o-TiO2(110) surfaces after very low
O2 exposures at LT, as previously shown in PSD and ESD experiments
[9,20], points against a strong preference towards the dissociative O2
chemisorption channel. We propose that the previously reported high
initial sticking probability of O2 on cooled TiO2(110) samples (0.5 to
0.65) [12,20] is essentially governed by the available charge in the
near-surface region rather than by the stabilization of O2 molecules at
vacancy sites. Thus, oxygen species may adsorb simultaneously in the
Ti troughs (molecularly) and at the Obr vacancy sites (dissociatively),
and the total sticking probability, stot, is the sum of the sticking
probability in the Ti troughs, s5f-Ti, and the sticking probability at the
Obr vacancy sites, sO-vac: stot=s5f-Ti+sO-vac.. Indeed, the measured
high initial sticking coefﬁcients [12,20] at 120 K and at even lower
temperature are consistent with this picture. Note that much more
electronic charge is available on the surface than can be provided from
the Obr vacancies.
The O2-TiO2(110) interaction mechanism proposed here is
consistent with recently published data by Henderson addressing
the role of O2 photodesorption in the photooxidation of acetone [19].
By varying the preheating conditions or performing pre-irradiation on
O2-exposed TiO2(110), the PSD events corresponding to O2 photo-
desorption and photochemical decomposition to acetate have been
found to be uncorrelated [19]. In light of our new explanation of the
~410 K desorption peak and the recent data on the role of O2
photodesorption in the photooxidation of acetone by Henderson [19],
it seems that the O2 molecules that desorb at ~410 K, which, in part,
can also be photodesorbed from the surface at ~120 K [9,13,16,22], are
actually the less interesting oxygen species (since non-reactive). The
desorbing O2 molecules solely act as electron scavengers, but they are
not directly involved in photooxidation reactions.
On the contrary, the “lack-of-charge-model” that allows us to
understand the O2-TPD peak at ~410 K is at variance with the O2-TiO2
(110) interaction mechanisms proposed previously. Henderson et al.
proposed that up to three O2 molecules adsorb at each Obr vacancy site
at 120 K and that one O2 molecule dissociates in the Obr vacancy upon
heating, whereas the other two O2 molecules desorb at ~410 K [12].
The data presented here are not consistent with this model, and we
believe that the model by Henderson et al. focuses too much on Obr
vacancies as charge donors. The possibility of O2 chemisorption in the
Ti troughs enabled through charge transfer from the near-surface
region has not been accounted for in Ref. [12]. We stress that the
interesting data of Ref. [12] can be consistently explained within our
proposed “lack-of-charge-model”.
The situation is similar in the study by Kimmel and Petrik [20]. To
explain the loss of O2 molecules between ~150 K and ~400 K, these
authors suggested the formation of tetraoxygen attached to Obr
vacancies at LT, as previously predicted by Pillay et al. in a DFT study
[82]. As in Ref. [12], Kimmel and Petrik assumed that the O2 molecules
are stabilized on the surface entirely through Obr vacancies, and other
charge donors in the near-surface region were not considered for the
adsorption of O2 at LT. However, because most of the Obr vacancies are
healed upon O2 exposure at LT we can rule out that the stabilization of
tetraoxygen close to Obr vacancies is a major channel. It is also worth
noting that Pillay et al. [82] assumed a stoichiometric bulk, which
renders the conclusions of this DFT study questionable. Especially
when addressing the adsorption of electronegative species on
reduced TiO2(110), it is crucial to take the bulk reduction into account
[36–38,45,50,80,81,83]. At variance with the conclusions drawn in
[82] and [20], our STM and TPD data point to a model wherein the
thermally activated O2 chemistry on reduced TiO2(110) can be fully
described by considering molecular and dissociative O2 adsorption
channels. In our model, the O2 molecules dissociate in the Ti troughs at
temperatures between ~150 K and ~400 K through the second O2
dissociation channel that occurs at 5f-Ti sites in the troughs and which
is not assisted by Obr vacancies.
5. Conclusion and outlook
The main conclusions of this detailed STM and TPD study can be
summarized as follows:
i) O2 molecules dissociate at Obr vacancy sites on the surface of
bulk-reduced TiO2(110) crystals even at temperatures as low
as 120 K (ﬁrst channel). Because most of the Obr vacancies are
healed upon high O2 exposure at 100 K≤T≤150 K, the
adsorbates, O2 molecules and Oot adatoms, are stabilized on
the surface through withdrawal of electronic charge essentially
from the near-surface region.
ii) By quantifying the densities of Oot adatoms and the residual Obr
vacancies after O2 exposure at 100 K≤T≤150 K, and the
desorbing O2 molecules at ~410 K we have established that
more than 90% of the withdrawn electronic charge stems from
the near-surface region. This important conclusion implies that
the excess charge from the defects in the near-surface region
needs to be considered when interpreting and modeling redox
reactions on the surfaces of bulk-reduced TiO2 crystals.
iii) Irrespective of the adsorption temperature, the stabilization of
oxygen species on clean reduced TiO2(110) surfaces is limited
by the available charge in the near-surface region. However,
due to kinetic limitations the ratio between molecular and
dissociative adsorption channels can be quite different. The
non-vacancy assisted O2 dissociation channel is suppressed on
low- and medium-reduced TiO2(110) crystals at temperatures
below 150 K–180 K, and, hence, O2 molecules accumulate on
the surface upon O2 exposure. For adsorption temperatures
1958
E. Lira et al. / Surface Science 604 (2010) 1945–1960
higher than 150 K–180 K, O2 molecules dissociate in the Ti
troughs (second channel).
iv) Once adsorbed, the Oot adatoms do not recombine again as
might be thought. Instead, upon heating of O2-exposed,
reduced TiO2(110) crystals the Oot adatoms react with out-
diffusing Ti interstitials, which leads to the formation of TiOx
islands (x~2) on the surface. In this way, the Oot adatoms are
incorporated into the surface.
v) Desorption of O2 molecules at ~410 K is induced by out-
diffusing Ti interstitials towards the surface. A Ti interstitial
depletion layer forms in the near-surface region upon heating
of O2-exposed, bulk-reduced TiO2(110) crystals to tempera-
tures between ~360 K and ~400 K. As a consequence, the
residual intact O2 molecules desorb, because they are suddenly
faced with a surface without excess charge available. Lacking
electronic charge may also explain why on low-temperature,
O2-saturated, reduced TiO2(110) crystals some O2 molecules
desorb already at temperatures between 140 K and 360 K.
vi) Our combined TPD and STM data indicate a strong dependence
of the O2-TPD peak at ~410 K on the sample history. This
ﬁnding may reconcile previous studies by Henderson et al. [12]
and Kimmel and Petrik [20], where different quantities of O2
molecules desorbing at ~410 K have been reported. No direct
correlation exists between the density of Obr vacancies before
O2 exposure and the O2-TPD peak at ~410 K. Our STM and TPD
data are consistent with previously published data but at
variance with previously proposed models of the O2-TiO2(110)
interaction.
The new insights into the complex relations between dissociative
and molecular O2 interaction channels may help to pave the way for
an improved understanding of the complex photochemistry of O2 on
TiO2 single crystal surfaces. Detailed mechanistic insight into
photochemical processes is still scarce, and it is not clear yet which
oxygen species are the main players in photoreactions. In addition, the
understanding of why O2 molecules can be stabilized on bulk-reduced
TiO2(110) crystals and desorb at unusual high temperatures may help
to better link model studies performed under UHV conditions with
more applied studies in the ﬁeld of materials science. With respect to
the latter point, it is noteworthy that striking similarities exist
between O2-TPD spectra obtained on rutile powder samples [30,84]
with those measured on well-characterized rutile TiO2(110) crystals.
In addition, it is noteworthy that also for TiO2 nanotube arrays
unexpected adsorption/desorption of O2 has been revealed [85], and
further that even under ambient pressure a narrow O2 desorption
peak at ~400 K was identiﬁed in TPD spectra on H2O2 treated “real”
TiO2 photocatalysts [86].
