Abstract
The object of this study was to provide a function for self-regeneration of precious metals in a usage ambience without auxiliary treatment. The strategy was to control the catalytic active site of those crystalline ceramics known as perovskite-type oxides at the atomic level in order to create the new, needed function. Three series of Pd-containing perovskite catalyst systems were prepared by coprecipitation of Pd with La, Fe, and Co using the alkoxide method. It was confirmed that Pd formed a solid solution of the perovskite-type oxide. And Pd in the perovskite crystal structure exhibited an abnormal oxidation number or higher binding energy than the normal bivalence, and it was presumed to be the reason for increasing the catalytic activity. The results of dissolution analysis for the aged Pd-perovskite catalyst suggested that Pd was not only dispersed on the surface of the perovskite crystal, but was present also in the solid solution of the perovskite crystal. The formation of a solid solution in this Pd-perovskite crystal was affected by the B site elements. And Pd in LaFe0.54Co0.36Pd0.10O3 system was more durable than in LaCo0.90Pd0.10O3 or in LaFe0.90Pd0.10O3. Furthermore, the formation of Pd solid solution into these perovskite crystals also depended on atmospheres and temperatures. It appeared that a high state of dispersion was maintained as Pd repeatedly forms solid solutions in the perovskite crystal or segregates out from the crystal depending on the fluctuation of redox conditions and temperatures in automotive catalyst ambience. We named such a catalyst, wherein a precious metal regenerates itself while in operation and remains highly active without requiring any auxiliary treatment, “an intelligent catalyst”.
