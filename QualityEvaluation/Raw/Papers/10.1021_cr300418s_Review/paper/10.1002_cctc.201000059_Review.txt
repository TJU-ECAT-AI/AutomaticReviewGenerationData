The Merits of Static and Dynamic High-Resolution Electron Microscopy (HREM) for the Study of Solid Catalysts†
Graphical Abstract
Recent advances in high resolution electron microscopy of solid catalysts are reviewed. We highlight how new insights can be made into the structure and chemistry of heterogeneous catalysts using a number of techniques including electron crystallography, 3D and 4D microscopy, aberration-corrected imaging and energy loss spectroscopy.
Abstract
Within the last decade there have been major advances in the deployment of electron microscopy for the elucidation of solid catalysts. Some of these have been technical (instrumental), like the arrival of aberration-corrected lenses and of new kinds of in situ stages for solid–gas and solid–liquid studies. Others have been largely conceptual, such as precession electron diffraction, to provide diffraction intensities suitable for crystallographic studies, or like the revolutionary approach of Zewail and colleagues in using 4D electron microscopy which, with its ability to reach picometer spatial resolution coupled with femtosecond time resolution, augurs well for future studies. Many major advances registered within the past few years are highlighted in this article and along with their significance.
Introduction
There has been a number of recent reviews dealing with the subject of the article;1–6 but such is the pace of change in technical improvements of the microscopes themselves, and in the specimen stages that have been devised to cope with in situ and other studies, that it is timely to outline some key recent developments which, we believe, have already added significantly to our knowledge of solid catalysts and which are likely to contribute further both to progress in understanding catalytic action of known catalysts and in pointing the way to the formulation of new ones.
The types of catalysts that we focus upon are of two main kinds: those that are of the oxide-supported precious-metal or transition-metal variety; and those that are either microporous or mesoporous solids of zeolitic or more generally nanoporous variety. The first of these entails detailed study of the number of metal atoms (or metal clusters) in a particular entity and its mode of attachment to the support; the second is concerned with the bulk structure of the solid catalyst because, in such solids, there are 3-dimensional surfaces, and a knowledge of global structure discloses insights into the nature of the catalytically active sites because these are embedded in, and are an integral part of the nanostructured solid.
So far as ‘static’ studies of catalysts are concerned, the single most important development that has taken place recently is the increasing availability of aberration-corrected (AC) electron microscopes. New possibilities with aberration-corrected electron microscopes was the subject of a recent, comprehensive Royal Society Discussion,7 in which all the major technical developments, encompassing both spherical and chromatic aberration, were initially assessed by leading investigations in the field. Indeed, one stalwart investigator, who pioneered the general use of electron microscopes fifty years ago, recently expressed8 the opinion that the quest to understand more about the nature and mode of action of catalyst is now the single most important factor responsible for the ever increasing deployment of AC microscopes. However, in addition to this fact, specialized approaches involving electron tomography, electron holography, and precession electron diffraction, not to mention the growing use of computational assistance, such as exit-wave reconstruction, are now widely used even with microscopes that are not fitted with aberration corrections.
Turning to dynamic electron microscopy (EM), it is well-recognized that considerable progress in unraveling catalytic action has been registered using video-rate speeds (i.e., with time-resolutions in the millisecond range), especially in environmental (E-TEM) studies reported by Gai et al.,1 by Hansen and others.3 Of late, nanosecond time-revolution using in situ dynamic transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies have been reported by La Grange et al.9 However, another major development is the so-called 4D electron microscopy, pioneered by Zewail,10 which has opened up fresh possibilities in the future study of solid catalysts and related materials, some of which we adumbrate later.
The Merits of Being Able to Image Individual Metal Atoms and Metal Cluster Catalysts
Prior to the arrival of AC-high-resolution microscopes it was extremely difficult, if not possible, to detect and identify individual atoms or small clusters of supported metal atom catalysts even under optimal conditions. Figure 1, taken from the work of Calvino and co-workers on Rh/CeO2 catalysts11 illustrates this fact clearly.

Nowadays, however, it had become almost routine to image individual, as well as small clusters of, metal atoms on supports such as carbon, Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 (Figure 2).

The consequences of improved resolution are manifold. Firstly, it is now increasingly argued that it is not the nanostructures (nanoparticles of 3–10 nm diameter) in systems such as supported Au or Pt (on CeO2 and after oxides) that are the loci of catalytic activity, but, instead, catalytic activity is thought to be located at much smaller entities, possibly consisting of one or a few individual metal atoms (i.e., see Ref. 16 , the work of Flytzani-Stephanopoulos et al.17 and the work of Kwak et al.14 shown in Figure 2 c, in which the single atoms of Pt are anchored directly to Al ions at the surface of the Al2O3 support).
Aberration correction has the effect of not only improving the resolution of the image but also, through the near-elimination of delocalization, the interpretability of image contrast. A key example of this second benefit is the work of Su et al. using AC-HREM to investigate the atomic structure of the surface of Ag particles, revealing terraces, steps, and edges.18
The work of Herzing et al.19 came to the conclusion that, in the Au/FeOx system for the low-temperature oxidation of CO in O2 to CO2, it was a bilayer of eight Au atoms that was the catalytically active entity. The question of how small must the clusters of Au be to effect this particular catalytic reaction has recently been examined by Liu et al.20 Their approach was to prepare Au nanoclusters by the colloidal deposition method. They ensured that, in testing the performance of their Au/FeOOH catalysts, all the organic species shrouding the colloidal nanoparticles were burnt away during preliminary oxidation (Figure 3).

CO Oxidation curves of the Au/FeOOH catalyst studied by Lui et al. (Ref. 20), in which the nanoclusters of Au were prepared by a colloidal method. The 1st curve shows a much slower rate of oxidation because the Au nanoclusters are still covered by an organic stabilizer. Once that is removed by oxidation, the catalyst exhibits remarkably high activity, with 50 % CO oxidation occurring at about 10 °C (2nd and 3rd curves).
They then investigated the resulting Au nanoparticles using AC-HREM, during the course of which they identified individual atoms of Au, which then enabled them to calibrate the intensity of a single Au atom. By examining minute nanoclusters systematically, and recording the integrated intensity of each atom column, they concluded that their nanoparticles (of approximate size 2.1±0.5 nm in diameter) were roughly spherical in shape, and of heights up to four or so atoms. Their further conclusion was that, contrary to the statement of Herzig et al.,19 bilayer gold clusters are not mandatory to obtain high activity.
So significant is this work that Liu et al., in the light of the continuing debate pertaining to the root cause of exception, that it now seems desirable that carefully designed experiments, using mass-selected minute clusters of Au are prepared (in the manner of Bernhardt et al.21 or Li et al.,22 or Tsukuda, in more detail later) so that such monodisperse preparations of Aun (n=1,2,…︁ etc. up to 10 or so) could then be systematically tested for various catalytic reactions.
Elucidating the Nature of Complex Mo–V–(Nb, Ta)–(Te, Sb)–O Selective Oxidation Catalysts by Dark-Field Microscopy
Selective oxidation catalysts, capable of converting propane (by ammoxidation) to acrylonitrile,23 are extremely complicated structurally (see below). It was only after the arrival of Rietveld’s method of refinement of X-ray powder diffractograms that it became possible to determine the atomic positions within these complex oxides, a procedure which gained in reliability with the availability of variable wavelength, highly monochromatized synchrotron X-ray sources.24 Of late, however, thanks to the use of aberration-connected high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-HRSTEM), deeper insights, and precise structure information have been retrieved pertaining to these complex oxides.
Before proceeding to outline how such insights have been gained, we first recall some relevant background facts. Firstly, for the selective oxidation and ammoxidation of propane, several families of vanadium-containing oxides, such as the Mo–V–W–O, the Mo–V–Nb–Sb–O, and the Mo–V–Nb–Te–O systems25–29 have been identified as particularly promising catalysts for acrylic acid and acrylonitrile production. Secondly, one of the most promising24, 25 of these catalysts is the two-phase Mo–V–Nb–Te–O system, commonly referred to as the M1/M2 system. A detailed model of the (more important) M1 structure, which has the composition {TeO}0.94(Mo7.8V12Nb)O28, based on a simultaneous Rietveld refinement of high-resolution X-ray and neutron powder diffraction data has been reported.24 The {TeO} entities are accommodated into the channels formed by rings of corner-shared transition-metal octahedra. The third point to emphasize is that the difficulty plaguing the structure refinements of such complex materials is that the model may have up to approximately 200 adjustable parameters, requiring very high-quality diffraction data and a suitable starting model with imposed constraints to ensure an acceptable and converging refinement. Lastly, a representation of the structure (projected along [001]) of the M1 phase of this complex oxide is shown in Figure 4. It is a fortunate fact that the unit cell repeat distance along the c-axis is 4.02 Å (the thickness of one octahedron effectively). This is a most favorable situation for (high angle annular dark field) HAADF images to be recorded along the [001] direction.

Figure 5 compares the projected images (by HREM) of the M1 phase taken with a conventional microscope (with and without aberration correction). A quantitative comparison of the x, y coordinates derived from the HAADF image with the Rietveld method is depicted in Figure 6. Because there is only a single layer of octahedra in the repeat distance, there are no overlapping crystallographically distinct metal sites. This allows for the direct extraction of x and y atomic coordinates from the HAADF images. The comparison between the HAADF-based x, y coordinates with those from the Rietveld-refined model reveals good agreement with discrepancies in atomic positions that are less than 0.3 Å. With such samples as the M1 phase, there is a major advantage in using high-resolution HAADF imaging because, to a first approximation, the image contrast scales with the square of Z, the atomic number. A comparison of the expected contrast ratios from the (Rietveld) refines M1 model and HAADF images is shown in Figure 7; and it is seen that most of the measured intensities follow the trends in the site occupancies predicted by the Rietveld model.

Buttrey has recently reported that, in his investigation of the structural subtleties exhibited by M1 phases in which Ta replaced Nb, there are definite indications of there being miscibility gaps in the solid-state.30 To what extent such gaps may have catalytic significance remains to be discovered. Buttrey and his colleagues have also uncovered three distinct Mo–V–O motifs in the complex (selective oxidation) catalysts, which are depicted in Figure 8.30

There is no known in situ technique for probing the individual and collective roles of the various redox systems (e.g., MoVI/MoV and VV/VIV) during the actual course of the cascade of catalytic processes from CH3CH2CH3 to CH3CH2CHO and to CH2CHCOOH.
Clarifying the Nature and Designing Superior Supported Oxide-on Oxide, Solid-Acid Catalysts. The Case of WOx on ZrO2
It has long been known that tungsten oxide supported on zirconia is a good catalyst for isomerizing light alkanes (C4 to C8) through the intermediacy of surface protons. Much, however, remains to be learnt about this kind of catalyst. In particular, what is the precise nature and optimum size of the clusters of WO3 (generally designated WOx) when bound to a ZrO2 support (Scheme 1)? Is the most active catalyst one that has monotungstate or polytungstate moieties at the surface?

By ingenious application of HAADF-STEM investigations, Kiely and co-workers31 have identified the key active site, and have thereby been led to design a superior catalyst. Their work is, in essence, summarized in Figures 9 and 10, in which both mono- and poly-tungstate entities supported on ZrO2 are clearly visible (through the utilization of a 200 kV JEOL 2200FS (STEM) microscope equipped with a CEOS probe Cs-corrector).

The caption to Figure 9 states the facts pertaining to the variety of sizes of WOx clusters that are present at a ZrO2 surface. But images such as that circled in Figure 10 clearly reveal (from the intensities of the octahedrally arranged M (where M is either W or Zr) centers) that small Zr-WOx clusters exist at the surface of high-activity samples. By deliberately altering the support of the introduced WO3 units (from ZrO2 to ZrOx(OH)4−2x), Kiely and co-workers could boost the quantity of Zr-WOx entities at the surface, thereby greatly improving the performance of the resulting solid as an acidic catalyst in, for example, the dehydration of methanol to yield dimethyl and ether. As it has subsequently been pointed out by Weckhuysen,32 the exact role of the minute amounts of Zr incorporated into the subnanometer Zr-WO3 cluster awaits clarification (by spectroscopic, computational, and kinetic means). It has also been pointed out that metal oxide catalysts consisting of ZrO2 and TiO2 as supports frequently outperform those composed of SiO2 or Al2O3 supports. In part, this may well be due to electronic factors: silica and alumina are insulators and are less readily oxidized or reduced in comparison with TiO2 or ZrO2. But it now seems prudent to probe afresh (by HAADF STEM) subnanometer entities of V–Ti, V–Zr and Cr–Zr clusters in cases in which hydrated oxide supports are used.
Electron Crystallography and its Application to the Determination of the Structure of a Complex Zeolite, IM-5
The approach of electron crystallography entails solving the structure of many small crystals in three dimensions using both the diffracted beams and the image formed in an electron microscope. The incoming beam is focused onto a small part of the specimen and then a selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is recorded using the aperture at the image plane. One for the great advantages of solving 3D structures by electron crystallography is that the beams that form the diffraction patterns may be refocused to form an image (the electron micrograph). This electron micrograph is, in essence, a hologram constructed from the diffracted beams and contains all the information about the relative phases of the beams, that is, the micrograph is a result of both the reconstructed amplitude and relative phases of the diffracted beam. The process is depicted in Figure 11.

Because the crystallography is carried out in the electron microscope, the 3D structural determination can be concerned with minute regions of the crystal of differing chemical composition, a feature that is of growing importance in the study of new solid catalysts of complicated stoichiometry. The method operates by using suitable regions of the electron micrograph rather than the electron diffraction pattern itself5, 33, 34 (this is known, rather inelegantly, as a selected-area Fourier diffractogram, SAFD). The micrograph, in effect, becomes the ‘crystal’ from which the structure is solved. In practice, micrographs are recorded along several suitable zone axes, and very thin sections (to avoid multiple scattering) are selected. This technique is particularly useful in solving the structures of mesoporous solids, typified by MCM-48,34 in which, because their unit cell dimensions are so large and the walls of the “vacancy lattice” (composed of large channels and cages) are amorphous, the structures are nearly impossible to be solved by X-ray crystallography. Structure solutions algorithms developed for X-ray crystallography (e.g., direct methods or charge-flipping) can be used also with electron intensities but care must be taken to avoid dynamical effects if conventional SAED patterns are used; for zeolites, such effects tend to be weak.35
IM-5 (Si288−mO576−2m) is a crystalline siliceous zeolite catalyst, one of the most complex (structurally) with 24 silicon atoms in the asymmetric unit.36 Its unit cell dimensions are: a=14.334, b=56.92, c=20.327 Å, space group Cmcm. It is a so-called high-silica zeolite, exhibiting strong Brønsted catalytic activity in the cracking of hydrocarbons and also in the reduction of NO.37 Its synthesis was first reported in 1998,38 but only recently has its structure been determined.36, 39 It is an important nanoporous catalyst because it governs the precise nature (i.e., shape and size) of the product molecules that may be formed within it during the process of thermal cracking of hydrocarbons.
Recently, X-ray powder diffraction has been combined with electron crystallography to determine the structures of several complex zeolite catalysts such as TNU-9,39 SSZ-74,40 and ITQ-37,41, 42 and the advantages of doing so have been emphasized by Sun et al.38 Electron crystallography alone has been used to determine the structure of a large range polycrystalline compounds, especially nano- and micro-sized intermetallic compounds and metal clusters.44, 45
The structure of IM-5 was determined36, 39 by combining SAED, 3D reconstruction of HRTEM images from different zone axes and distance least squares (DLS) refinement.46 The unit cell parameters were determined from SAED; the space group from extinctions in these patterns and from the projection symmetries of HRTEM images such as those shown in Figure 12 for the high-symmetry directions <100>.

Using the structure factor amplitudes and phases of 144 independent reflections obtained from the images shown in Figure 12, a 3D electrostatic potential map was calculated by inverse Fourier transformation (Figure 13). From this 3D potential map, all 24 unique Si positions could be determined. Oxygen atoms were added between each SiSi pair and further refined together with the Si positions by DLS refinement. The final structure model (Figure 14) deviates on average 0.16 Å for Si and 0.31 Å for O atom from the structure refined by X-ray powder diffractometry.

Precession Electron Diffraction and Its Potential in Solving the Structure of New Catalysts
The vast majority of crystal structures are determined by X-ray diffraction. The interaction of an X-ray with the crystal charge density is sufficiently strong to yield diffraction data with high signal-to-noise but weak enough to be described as kinematical in nature. In this kinematical limit, the intensities of reflections are proportional to the square of the structure factor for that reflection and this has huge advantages in solving crystal structures. The interaction of an electron, with the crystal potential is in general far stronger, intensities of reflections are ‘dynamical’ and are dominated by multiple scattering events. For many years, electron microscopists have devised methods to minimize dynamical effects to allow electron diffraction to be used for structure solution. These methods have included using ultrathin or weakly scattering crystals, as discussed above, using high voltage instruments, but in this case for many materials beam damage can be a limiting factor, or using weak reflections that are quasi-kinematical in nature, such as high order Laue zone (HOLZ) reflections at major zone axes.47
In 1994, Vincent and Midgley introduced a technique that involved rocking the beam to give hollow cone illumination onto the specimen and then de-rocking the beam back onto the optic axis below the specimen (Figure 15).48 This double-rocking idea developed from a similar ‘double-rocking’ method, introduced by Eades49 and Crewe a few years previously,50 and capitalized on the possibilities offered by hollow cone illumination.51

The hollow cone rocking–derocking action has a net effect equivalent to a (focused) stationary beam but with a crystal precessing about the optic axis, as one would find in X-ray precession experiments;52 this similarity led to the technique being called ‘precession electron diffraction’. Importantly, the precession effect means that the Ewald sphere is swept through the Bragg condition and so the intensities recorded are ‘integrated intensities’ which are less susceptible to dynamical effects.53 Moreover, although the diffraction pattern geometry has the same appearance as a zone axis pattern, the beam is tilted away from the zone axis by the precession angle. This further reduces the dynamical perturbations to the reflections. Figure 15 shows a diagram of the precession technique together with one of the original precessed patterns recorded from the [001] zone axis of Er2Ge2O7.
The circular patch of reflections in the zero-order Laue zone (ZOLZ) has a radius equal to twice the precession angle, and the width of the annulus of reflections in the HOLZ is equal to the precession angle. There are four key advantages of the precession technique:
1.
The precession action leads to many more reflections being visible in both the ZOLZ and HOLZ. The Ewald sphere is rocked backwards and forwards (twice) through the reflection and many more reflections are excited compared to a conventional pattern.
2.
The diffracted discs are of uniform intensity and are not dominated by the complex contrast seen, for example, in conventional CBED patterns. The precession action leads to intensities integrated through the Bragg condition.
3.
With the beam tilted away from the zone axis, the dynamical interactions are minimized but the geometry of the zone axis pattern is preserved.
4.
A highly focused beam can be retained to enable diffraction data to be collected from small crystallites.
The use of precession electron diffraction for structure solution has been growing in recent years. There have been a number of studies of complex oxide systems including minerals (e.g., beryl, andalusite, cordierite, uvarovite, åkaermanite and mordenite), other mixed metal oxides including (Ga,In)2SnO4, Ba6Mn5O15, and La4Cu3MoO12, and studies of intermetallic systems such as Al-Fe and Al-Mg-Zn. In the catalysis field, electron diffraction has been applied for many years to zeolite and related structures, known to be difficult to solve with conventional X-ray methods. Dorset, in particular, has pioneered the use of electron diffraction in the study of zeolites, and recently used precession electron diffraction, to solve many previously unknown or partially known structures.54 Figure 16 shows a precession pattern recorded from MCM68, together with the structure solution found using the maximum entropy algorithm MICE.55

McCusker and Baerlocher have also recently combined precession electron diffraction with powder X-ray diffraction and high resolution imaging to solve zeolite structures ZSM-5 and TNU-9.56
The probe size of a convergent beam in precession varies approximately as the square of the precession angle and linearly with the spherical aberration coefficient of the probe-forming lens. In order to reduce the effects of multiple scattering, and thus to record usable electron diffraction intensities, the precession angle has to be relatively large (typically 2–3°). Thus, in most electron microscopes, this means the probe size may be 10’s of nm in diameter on the specimen.
If ultra-small particles are to be studied, then the probe size can be reduced by using aberration-corrected lenses. In principle, this can lead to a probe size of approximately 1 nm or less (limited only by higher order aberrations), ideal for the study of catalyst nanoparticles. In practice, the electronics of the scan system will need upgrading to reach that theoretical minimum. However, this is technically possible and so we have in the very near future the exciting prospect of recording precession patterns from, and thus solving crystal structures of, nm-sized catalyst crystals.
The Merits of Electron Tomography and Electron Holography
Many complex devices and materials are three-dimensional in nature at many different length scales. A large fraction of catalysts used are highly porous structures with complex 3D structural networks and particle distributions. These are often challenging structures to investigate by electron microscopy, and electron tomography has proven to be a very powerful tool in unraveling the 3D structure at the nanoscale. Electron tomography57 is a method by which a series of images (projections) are acquired, normally about a single tilt axis, so that the 3D structure is viewed from many directions. The ensemble of images within the tilt series is then ‘back-projected’ into a 3D space and the object is reconstructed. The reconstruction (or tomogram) can then be visualized in many ways, including an isosurface render to pick out a particular phase, a volume projection to visualize the 3D mass thickness of the object and by taking slices, to reveal clearly internal structures, such as second phases and pore distributions.
Early electron tomography experiments used a tilt series of bright-field images but very quickly it became apparent that STEM HAADF imaging was the image mode of choice for the study of catalysts.58 The great advantages of STEM HAADF imaging are two-fold. Firstly, the STEM HAADF images are incoherent in nature, meaning that such images are far less prone to contrast reversals with changes to thickness and defocus, compared to bright field (BF) (coherent) imaging. Secondly, the STEM HAADF images have high atomic contrast; in the limit this varies as the square of the atomic number, approaching Rutherford-type scattering. This is of course extremely useful in seeing ultra-small metallic nanoparticles in light element supports, as is often needed in the study of heterogeneous catalysts.
We show here three case studies highlighting the application of STEM HAADF tomography to the study of heterogeneous catalysts. In the first case, see Figure 17, we show how the reconstructed tomogram of Pd/Ru nanoparticles supported on and within disordered mesoporous silica.59 Here, the particles are colored red and silica grey. A study of the underlying support showed that the pore surface was fractal in nature which can have consequences for the selectivity of reactions under certain conditions.60 Furthermore, it was found that the distribution of the bimetallic nanoparticles was not random and that there was a very strong preference for the particles to anchor themselves to surface features which had strong negative Gaussian curvature (in other words ‘saddle points’). Such fine-scale 3D information is just not possible to achieve by any other technique.

As a second example, the electron tomography of an ordered mesoporous silica, MCM48 is shown in Figure 18.61 This had been studied by more conventional electron microscopy, forming lattice images (see previous sections) from which the gyroid pore structure was determined. By recording STEM HAADF images, the 3D reconstruction confirmed the gyroid structure and the overall symmetry of the MCM48 structure. Differences were seen although in the pore size determination. 3D real space crystallography of this kind also allows defects to be seen, and a ‘twin’ boundary was discovered in MCM48, with a common {112} twin plane.

Lastly, electron tomography is adept at visualizing the faceting of nanocrystals. In Figure 19, we show a reconstruction of heavy metal oxide catalysts based on (Ce/Tb/Zr)O2−x with Au nanoparticles decorating the surface. The ceria facets are predominantly composed of {111} crystal faces but equally interesting is the observation that the Au nanoparticles occupy preferentially the ‘crevices’ formed by the facet structure.62

There are many electron imaging modes available for electron tomography. One with a great deal of potential is that of volume-spectroscopy63 or 4D spectral tomography in which energy loss is combined with the three spatial dimensions. One of the great benefits is that spectral information can be extracted from subvolumes avoiding any projection artifacts.
Nowadays, many catalysts are designed such that they have a ferromagnetic core (of Fe or Co) covered with a coating of either carbon or silica, to which are attached the active centers that impart the activity to the entire composite. The merit in doing this devolved upon the ease of separation (magnetically) of the catalyst itself (for further use) from the mixture of products and unconverted reactant species. A striking example of the implementation of this concept is contained in the work of Lu et al.64 (Figure 20) who nanoengineered a magnetically separable hydrogenation catalyst. These workers used carbon (as a coating for the ferromagnetic cobalt particles) and also as a support for metallic palladium, which constitutes the hydrogenating center. Electron holography assists in characterizing such catalysts.

Some Insights into Auto-Exhaust Catalysts
The work of Calvino et al.65 on the oxygen storage capacity of CeO2-based solids that are used in a three-way, auto-exhaust catalyst has benefited enormously from investigations involving HREM (STEM) and electron tomography. Typically, a composition such as Ce0.68Zr0.32O2 releases its oxygen (from within the bulk) when heated in H2 up to 900 °C, and it does so initially at temperatures in the vicinity of 700 K. However, when some 0.3 % of Rh is distributed over the surface of this (Ce–Zr)O2 support, it is seen that on heating again, the oxygen from the bulk is released at approximately 450 K. A spillover process occurs on the Rh and the dissociated hydrogen combine with the oxygen from the bulk, thereby creating vacancies.
HREM has proven invaluable in the hands of Calvino and collaborators in elucidating the nature of this kind of phenomenon. In particular, an in-depth structural and analytical investigation of two 25 wt % Ce0.8Pr0.2O2 (supported on δ-Al2O3) catalysts (with 3.5 wt % SiO2 and 4 wt % La2O3) was performed by Lopez-Haro et al.66 in which they aimed at clarifying the origin of the difference in evolution of their oxygen storage capacity with temperature. Using a combination of TEM and STEM, the details of the structural and compositional changes of the two catalysts with reduction temperature established the role of SiO2 as a stabilizer of the oxygen handling properties of the Ce–Pr mixed oxide phase under high temperature reducing environments. Pr does not fully mix with Ce during the synthesis of both catalysts and the SiO2 doping provides a barrier against lanthanide element incorporation into the alumina support. This hinders the formation of LnAlO3 (Ln=Ce, Pr) perovskite thought responsible for the loss of oxygen storage capacity during hydrogen treatments at temperatures above 800 °C.
The Value of Electron Energy-Loss Spectro- scopy (EELS)
By adding an electron spectrometer to either a STEM or a TEM instrument, a great deal of extra structural information about the specimen may be extracted. For example, the wealth of information schematized in Figure 21 is retrievable. The range of energies over which reasonable signals may be obtained extends to about 2000 eV below the incident energy. Proceeding from the zero-loss peak, the first feature of interest is the plasmon peak, which usually occurs between about 5 and 25 eV. Since plasmons are collective excitations of the electron gas, their energies are governed by the density of the electron in the sample, and the extent to which the electrons are free or bound. π- or σ-electrons have different energies; and one often readily distinguishes between a surface and a bulk plasmon. Plasmon resonance can be triggered either by light irradiation or by electromagnetic fields associated with impinging electrons.

Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and imaging provides a wealth of information including chemical composition, valence state (or oxidation number obtained from ELNES), interatomic distances (obtained from EXELFS), information pertaining to σ and π electrons (obtained from plasmon peaks) and momentum density of bonding electrons (obtained from Compton scattering).10
At higher energy loss, the electron intensity is much weaker and the features are analogous to the absorption edges found in X-ray absorption spectra, and they arise from scattering of the transmitted electrons by inner-shell (core) electrons of each element present in the specimen.
The great merit of EELS and electron-loss imaging in STEM and energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) is the information pertaining to composition and structure they yield: valence states, bond distances, and composition may all, under ideal conditions, be retrieved from the kind of spectra schematized in Figure 21. The number of d electrons in a transition metal or platinum group metal ion, coordination fingerprints and bond-mapping as well as bond-distances may all, under favorable circumstances, be deduced from EELS spectra (see Refs. 5 and Ref. 10).
Owing to the very recent availability of high-intensity, sharply focused (ca. 1 Å diameter) electron beams operating within AC-STEM instruments, truly atomic-scale chemical imaging is now possible, as recently demonstrated by Muller et al.67 who examined perovskite layers (Figure 22).

Such a development augurs well for the future of electron microscope studies of a wide variety of oxide catalysts, especially those based on novel perovskites now used increasingly in photocatalysis.68 Because of the availability of AC-STEM instruments an increase of some 100-fold in the signal becomes possible compared with what was achievable prior to their advent. New possibilities in EELS studies are discussed in the following sections.
4D Electron Microscopy
Four-dimensional (4D) ultrafast (stroboscopic) electron microscopy became feasible some five years ago, thanks to the efforts of Zewail and co-workers.69 Similar efforts have been made to develop ultrafast single-shot experiments at the Lawrence Livermore labs, known as dynamic TEM, or DTEM.70 It is an approach that adds the dimensions of time to the three spatial ones that are retrievable by HREM; and it has opened up new vistas and applications by using timed, single-electron (or just a few electron) packets. The full details of the Zewail approach71 and the variety of recent applications10 have been described elsewhere. Real-space imaging, Fourier-space (diffraction pattern) recording and EELS studies may all be carried out at femtosecond (fs) scale resolution. All this is achieved through coherent electron packets, which are liberated from a photocathode with femtosecond laser pulses, accelerated at 120 or 200 keV, and contain as little as one electron per pulse (Figure 24).

Reference 10 is a monograph that deals in depth with the principles and applications (up to late 2009) of 4D EM; and the reader is referred to that text to see, amongst others, how EELS spectra may be collected at subpicosecond time scales.72 That text also shows how convergent beam (CB) recording and electron energy-gain measurements are carried out.73
Many remarkable results have already been attained by Zewail’s 4D microscopy approach. However, the concerted study of catalysts has not yet begun. The fs-resolved EELS data recently recorded by Carbone et al.74, 75 using Zewail’s ultrafast electron microscope operating in the single-electron per pulse mode uses a train of 220 fs infrared laser pulses (λ=1038 nm), which is split into two paths (Figure 23). One path is frequency-doubled and used to excite the specimen on the microscope grid, and the other is frequency-tripled into the UV and directed to the photoemissive cathode to generate the electron packets. Full details of the way the EELS data and parallel information are recorded are given in Refs. 74 and Ref. 75.

Carbone et al.,74, 75 on examining graphite, observed non-equilibrium compression and subsequent expansion of the graphene layers, and is correlated with the direction of change from sp2 to sp3 (i.e., to 3D-diamond-like structure) electronic hybridization. With the reality of achieving even shorter optical pulse,76 the Zewail group provided the methodology to generate attosecond (10−18 s) electron pulses for imaging and for EELS, that is, on the time-scale at which electrons move. With such spatial and temporal resolutions, one has reached the ultimate scale of discrimination in bond lengths and angles and also in the movement of bonding electrons. In principle, therefore, unprecedented degrees of insight into the processes that occur at the surface of catalysts after the transfer of electrons to or from the reactant species and the solid catalyst become possible.
Time-resolved in situ studies of catalysts by electron microscopy
In addition to the picometer (spatial resolution) coupled with femtosecond (time resolution) that is an inherent feature of Zewail’s 4D electron microscopy, which has yet to be applied to a dynamic study of solid catalysts, there have been many successes in probing catalytic action at more modest time scales but at even higher spatial resolutions than have been achieved with 4D EM. Substantial progress has been made by Gai, Helveg, Henry, Allard, Yacaman, Creemer, and others in designing TEM systems that permit HREM images to be recorded of solid catalysts undergoing dynamic changes under modest (reduced) gas pressures.
Gai77 has perfected her in situ E-TEM approach in such a manner as to achieve atomic resolution in the imaging of nanoparticles (specifically Pt on TiO2) participating in catalytic turnover. The highest degree of time resolution so far attained by Gai and co-workers falls in the range of milliseconds. However, her instrument can routinely be employed to cope with gas pressures of up to 50 000 Pa of H2. Figure 24 shows a selective oxidation catalyst (known as CoAlPO-3678), which remains structurally stable up to about 400 °C at this relatively high-pressure (50 000 Pa) of H2.
One especially important aspect of heterogeneous catalysts, concerned with nanoparticle shape dynamics, is of considerable current interest. The size, shapes, and detailed surface structure of supported metal nanoparticles (such as Cu/ZrO in the synthesis of methanol from CO/CO2/H2 mixtures) play a key role in their catalytic performance. Although nanoparticles with predefined shapes can be readily synthesized, there is no guarantee that such materials remain stable when exposed to reaction conditions. In this regard, the work of Hansen et al., shown in Figure 25, is of particular relevance.79

Currently, Gai and Boyes80 are engaged in adapting a JEOL AC-STEM/TEM instrument to cope with environmental electron microscopy in the in situ sense outlined above.
A significant advance in environmental (in situ) TEM has been registered recently in a joint Dutch–Danish collaboration reported by Creemer et al.81 The strategy used by these workers (in order to limit the number of gas atoms in the specimen stage of the microscope) was to build a novel nanoreactor that is functionalized with micrometer-sized gas-flow channels, electron-transparent windows (made of amorphous SiNx) and a special heating device (Figure 26).

This micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) approach enables the integration of a heater and a thermal sensor for variable-temperature experiments at a subsecond time scale. A comparable advance, also using MEMS technology, has been made by Allard and Yacaman et al.82
Future Prospects
There are many growth points in electron microscopy that will lead to further advances in the elucidation of the nature and properties of novel catalysts. On the purely instrumental side, the so-called SMART project centered in Berlin is concerned, among others, with producing a spectro-microscope with lateral resolution of 2 nm with an energy resolution of 100 meV; both spherical and chromatic aberration is corrected, it is energy filtered and combines low energy electron microscopy (LEEM) and photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM), using an X-ray synchrotron as the source of radiation. Another significant development in this area is that pioneered by Asakura and his colleagues83 involving an aberration-corrected multipole Wien filter for energy-filtered X-ray PEEM.
PEEM, using UV light as a source, proved immensely valuable in the hands of Ertl and collaborators84 in investigating the dynamics of surface reactions on model catalysts, in which the various ‘chaotic’ and well-behaved features of reactants at surfaces could be followed from the local changes of work function during reactions
Ultralow-energy excitations and prospects for spatially-resolved spectroscopy
With the availability of monochromated electron sources, there is increasing interest in using energy loss spectroscopy to study ultralow-energy excitations. Howie first discussed the possibility of photon-assisted EELS to investigate excitations generated by a tuned photon beam or pulse train.[85] Energy gain spectroscopy is then possible, discussed further theoretically by Garcia de Abajo and Kociak86 and realized experimentally by Zewail’s group.73
Au and Ag nanoparticles exhibit a fascinating array of low energy modes that can be probed with monochromated EELS. The low energy of the excitations however means that the signal collected is delocalized, possibly over several tens of nanometers. One way to improve the localization of such a signal is to acquire only those electrons that have scattered to relatively high angles. Such energy-filtered low-loss STEM (EF-STEM) HAADF imaging is possible in some instruments and one of the first examples of this is shown in Figure 27 from the Stuttgart group87 using their SESAM instrument.

The need to prepare monodispersed nanocrystals and nanoclusters of catalysts
As we have indicated elsewhere,88 when bimetallic or trimetallic nanoclusters need to be prepared for catalytic testing, a reliable procedure is to use a precursor organometallic molecule (or ion) in which the two (or three) metals are an integral part of the structure of that precursor. The organo component of the precursor molecule is readily removed (by gentle thermolysis or oxidation at low temperature, for example) so as to yield the desired, monodisperse catalyst. This is the method we have used for systems such as Ru10Pt2C2, Ru5PtC, and Pd6Ru6.88, 89 The same strategy was used by Turner et al.90 in their study of nanocluster-nanoparticle gold, whereby they took a Au55 compound as a precursor.
The whole question of catalytic activity and cluster size in gold catalysis is still a deeply enigmatic issue. Thus the recent work of Tsukuda and co-workers91 on the dependence of catalytic activity as a function of size (in the range 1.0 to 9.5 nm), which straddles the cluster–particle divide, for some of the reactions shown in Scheme 2 is given in Figure 28; we see that the rate constants fall dramatically with increasing size of the Au cluster nanoparticle. In the Au preparations of Tsukuda and co-workers, such as that of many other workers in this field (i.e., Ref. 92), the Au clusters are partially covered with weakly bound poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidine) (PVP), which still allow sufficient access of reactants to bare regions of the Au surface. Tsukuda very recently studied a series of Au preparations in which ‘magic numbers’ of atoms were stabilized by PVP, and studied them using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS).93 He concluded that the reactivity of magic numbers smaller than 70 atoms are broadly in line with those of free clusters (in the gas phase).

An altogether different approach to the preparation of nanosized metals has recently been described by Zheng and co-workers.94 These workers employed an in situ TEM approach, in which the growth trajectories of Pt nanoparticle colloids (stabilized by a surfactant) were investigated, using a liquid cell that operates inside a TEM;95, 96 these workers showed that nanocrystals of Pt can grow either by monomer attachment from solution or by particle coalescence. Through the combination of these two processes, an initially broad size distribution can spontaneously narrow into a nearly monodisperse distribution (Figure 29).

With these two distinct modes of preparation, the role of advanced HREM studies will take further significance in pinning down precisely the roles of the enhanced catalytic performance of nanocluster metallic or bimetallic entities.
Epilogue
There are many other growth points in electron microscopy that could well have an impact on the study of solid catalysts. One of these is low voltage STEM, such as proposed in the SALVE project,97 sometimes entitled ‘Gentle STEM’, a term associated with the recent work of Krivanek et al.98 This technique refers to the practice of recording annular dark field (ADF) images and EELS at low primary energies of the electron beam, a feature made possible by the aberration correction of the STEM instruments. It is now possible to reach probe sizes close to 1 Å at 60 keV, that is, at an operating energy that avoids direct knock-on damage in materials consisting of light elements such as boron, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. Krivanek et al. have shown that their approach allows chemical identification of individual atoms, both heavy and light, and the recording of atomic motion of individual heavy atoms (Figure 30).

Introduction
There has been a number of recent reviews dealing with the subject of the article;1–6 but such is the pace of change in technical improvements of the microscopes themselves, and in the specimen stages that have been devised to cope with in situ and other studies, that it is timely to outline some key recent developments which, we believe, have already added significantly to our knowledge of solid catalysts and which are likely to contribute further both to progress in understanding catalytic action of known catalysts and in pointing the way to the formulation of new ones.
The types of catalysts that we focus upon are of two main kinds: those that are of the oxide-supported precious-metal or transition-metal variety; and those that are either microporous or mesoporous solids of zeolitic or more generally nanoporous variety. The first of these entails detailed study of the number of metal atoms (or metal clusters) in a particular entity and its mode of attachment to the support; the second is concerned with the bulk structure of the solid catalyst because, in such solids, there are 3-dimensional surfaces, and a knowledge of global structure discloses insights into the nature of the catalytically active sites because these are embedded in, and are an integral part of the nanostructured solid.
So far as ‘static’ studies of catalysts are concerned, the single most important development that has taken place recently is the increasing availability of aberration-corrected (AC) electron microscopes. New possibilities with aberration-corrected electron microscopes was the subject of a recent, comprehensive Royal Society Discussion,7 in which all the major technical developments, encompassing both spherical and chromatic aberration, were initially assessed by leading investigations in the field. Indeed, one stalwart investigator, who pioneered the general use of electron microscopes fifty years ago, recently expressed8 the opinion that the quest to understand more about the nature and mode of action of catalyst is now the single most important factor responsible for the ever increasing deployment of AC microscopes. However, in addition to this fact, specialized approaches involving electron tomography, electron holography, and precession electron diffraction, not to mention the growing use of computational assistance, such as exit-wave reconstruction, are now widely used even with microscopes that are not fitted with aberration corrections.
Turning to dynamic electron microscopy (EM), it is well-recognized that considerable progress in unraveling catalytic action has been registered using video-rate speeds (i.e., with time-resolutions in the millisecond range), especially in environmental (E-TEM) studies reported by Gai et al.,1 by Hansen and others.3 Of late, nanosecond time-revolution using in situ dynamic transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies have been reported by La Grange et al.9 However, another major development is the so-called 4D electron microscopy, pioneered by Zewail,10 which has opened up fresh possibilities in the future study of solid catalysts and related materials, some of which we adumbrate later.
The Merits of Being Able to Image Individual Metal Atoms and Metal Cluster Catalysts
Prior to the arrival of AC-high-resolution microscopes it was extremely difficult, if not possible, to detect and identify individual atoms or small clusters of supported metal atom catalysts even under optimal conditions. Figure 1, taken from the work of Calvino and co-workers on Rh/CeO2 catalysts11 illustrates this fact clearly.

Nowadays, however, it had become almost routine to image individual, as well as small clusters of, metal atoms on supports such as carbon, Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 (Figure 2).

The consequences of improved resolution are manifold. Firstly, it is now increasingly argued that it is not the nanostructures (nanoparticles of 3–10 nm diameter) in systems such as supported Au or Pt (on CeO2 and after oxides) that are the loci of catalytic activity, but, instead, catalytic activity is thought to be located at much smaller entities, possibly consisting of one or a few individual metal atoms (i.e., see Ref. 16 , the work of Flytzani-Stephanopoulos et al.17 and the work of Kwak et al.14 shown in Figure 2 c, in which the single atoms of Pt are anchored directly to Al ions at the surface of the Al2O3 support).
Aberration correction has the effect of not only improving the resolution of the image but also, through the near-elimination of delocalization, the interpretability of image contrast. A key example of this second benefit is the work of Su et al. using AC-HREM to investigate the atomic structure of the surface of Ag particles, revealing terraces, steps, and edges.18
The work of Herzing et al.19 came to the conclusion that, in the Au/FeOx system for the low-temperature oxidation of CO in O2 to CO2, it was a bilayer of eight Au atoms that was the catalytically active entity. The question of how small must the clusters of Au be to effect this particular catalytic reaction has recently been examined by Liu et al.20 Their approach was to prepare Au nanoclusters by the colloidal deposition method. They ensured that, in testing the performance of their Au/FeOOH catalysts, all the organic species shrouding the colloidal nanoparticles were burnt away during preliminary oxidation (Figure 3).

CO Oxidation curves of the Au/FeOOH catalyst studied by Lui et al. (Ref. 20), in which the nanoclusters of Au were prepared by a colloidal method. The 1st curve shows a much slower rate of oxidation because the Au nanoclusters are still covered by an organic stabilizer. Once that is removed by oxidation, the catalyst exhibits remarkably high activity, with 50 % CO oxidation occurring at about 10 °C (2nd and 3rd curves).
They then investigated the resulting Au nanoparticles using AC-HREM, during the course of which they identified individual atoms of Au, which then enabled them to calibrate the intensity of a single Au atom. By examining minute nanoclusters systematically, and recording the integrated intensity of each atom column, they concluded that their nanoparticles (of approximate size 2.1±0.5 nm in diameter) were roughly spherical in shape, and of heights up to four or so atoms. Their further conclusion was that, contrary to the statement of Herzig et al.,19 bilayer gold clusters are not mandatory to obtain high activity.
So significant is this work that Liu et al., in the light of the continuing debate pertaining to the root cause of exception, that it now seems desirable that carefully designed experiments, using mass-selected minute clusters of Au are prepared (in the manner of Bernhardt et al.21 or Li et al.,22 or Tsukuda, in more detail later) so that such monodisperse preparations of Aun (n=1,2,…︁ etc. up to 10 or so) could then be systematically tested for various catalytic reactions.
Elucidating the Nature of Complex Mo–V–(Nb, Ta)–(Te, Sb)–O Selective Oxidation Catalysts by Dark-Field Microscopy
Selective oxidation catalysts, capable of converting propane (by ammoxidation) to acrylonitrile,23 are extremely complicated structurally (see below). It was only after the arrival of Rietveld’s method of refinement of X-ray powder diffractograms that it became possible to determine the atomic positions within these complex oxides, a procedure which gained in reliability with the availability of variable wavelength, highly monochromatized synchrotron X-ray sources.24 Of late, however, thanks to the use of aberration-connected high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-HRSTEM), deeper insights, and precise structure information have been retrieved pertaining to these complex oxides.
Before proceeding to outline how such insights have been gained, we first recall some relevant background facts. Firstly, for the selective oxidation and ammoxidation of propane, several families of vanadium-containing oxides, such as the Mo–V–W–O, the Mo–V–Nb–Sb–O, and the Mo–V–Nb–Te–O systems25–29 have been identified as particularly promising catalysts for acrylic acid and acrylonitrile production. Secondly, one of the most promising24, 25 of these catalysts is the two-phase Mo–V–Nb–Te–O system, commonly referred to as the M1/M2 system. A detailed model of the (more important) M1 structure, which has the composition {TeO}0.94(Mo7.8V12Nb)O28, based on a simultaneous Rietveld refinement of high-resolution X-ray and neutron powder diffraction data has been reported.24 The {TeO} entities are accommodated into the channels formed by rings of corner-shared transition-metal octahedra. The third point to emphasize is that the difficulty plaguing the structure refinements of such complex materials is that the model may have up to approximately 200 adjustable parameters, requiring very high-quality diffraction data and a suitable starting model with imposed constraints to ensure an acceptable and converging refinement. Lastly, a representation of the structure (projected along [001]) of the M1 phase of this complex oxide is shown in Figure 4. It is a fortunate fact that the unit cell repeat distance along the c-axis is 4.02 Å (the thickness of one octahedron effectively). This is a most favorable situation for (high angle annular dark field) HAADF images to be recorded along the [001] direction.

Figure 5 compares the projected images (by HREM) of the M1 phase taken with a conventional microscope (with and without aberration correction). A quantitative comparison of the x, y coordinates derived from the HAADF image with the Rietveld method is depicted in Figure 6. Because there is only a single layer of octahedra in the repeat distance, there are no overlapping crystallographically distinct metal sites. This allows for the direct extraction of x and y atomic coordinates from the HAADF images. The comparison between the HAADF-based x, y coordinates with those from the Rietveld-refined model reveals good agreement with discrepancies in atomic positions that are less than 0.3 Å. With such samples as the M1 phase, there is a major advantage in using high-resolution HAADF imaging because, to a first approximation, the image contrast scales with the square of Z, the atomic number. A comparison of the expected contrast ratios from the (Rietveld) refines M1 model and HAADF images is shown in Figure 7; and it is seen that most of the measured intensities follow the trends in the site occupancies predicted by the Rietveld model.

Buttrey has recently reported that, in his investigation of the structural subtleties exhibited by M1 phases in which Ta replaced Nb, there are definite indications of there being miscibility gaps in the solid-state.30 To what extent such gaps may have catalytic significance remains to be discovered.

There is no known in situ technique for probing the individual and collective roles of the various redox systems (e.g., MoVI/MoV and VV/VIV) during the actual course of the cascade of catalytic processes from CH3CH2CH3 to CH3CH2CHO and to CH2CHCOOH.
Clarifying the Nature and Designing Superior Supported Oxide-on Oxide, Solid-Acid Catalysts. The Case of WOx on ZrO2
It has long been known that tungsten oxide supported on zirconia is a good catalyst for isomerizing light alkanes (C4 to C8) through the intermediacy of surface protons. Much, however, remains to be learnt about this kind of catalyst. In particular, what is the precise nature and optimum size of the clusters of WO3 (generally designated WOx) when bound to a ZrO2 support (Scheme 1)? Is the most active catalyst one that has monotungstate or polytungstate moieties at the surface?

By ingenious application of HAADF-STEM investigations, Kiely and co-workers31 have identified the key active site, and have thereby been led to design a superior catalyst. Their work is, in essence, summarized in Figures 9 and 10, in which both mono- and poly-tungstate entities supported on ZrO2 are clearly visible (through the utilization of a 200 kV JEOL 2200FS (STEM) microscope equipped with a CEOS probe Cs-corrector).

The caption to Figure 9 states the facts pertaining to the variety of sizes of WOx clusters that are present at a ZrO2 surface. But images such as that circled in Figure 10 clearly reveal (from the intensities of the octahedrally arranged M (where M is either W or Zr) centers) that small Zr-WOx clusters exist at the surface of high-activity samples. By deliberately altering the support of the introduced WO3 units (from ZrO2 to ZrOx(OH)4−2x), Kiely and co-workers could boost the quantity of Zr-WOx entities at the surface, thereby greatly improving the performance of the resulting solid as an acidic catalyst in, for example, the dehydration of methanol to yield dimethyl and ether. As it has subsequently been pointed out by Weckhuysen,32 the exact role of the minute amounts of Zr incorporated into the subnanometer Zr-WO3 cluster awaits clarification (by spectroscopic, computational, and kinetic means). It has also been pointed out that metal oxide catalysts consisting of ZrO2 and TiO2 as supports frequently outperform those composed of SiO2 or Al2O3 supports. In part, this may well be due to electronic factors: silica and alumina are insulators and are less readily oxidized or reduced in comparison with TiO2 or ZrO2. But it now seems prudent to probe afresh (by HAADF STEM) subnanometer entities of V–Ti, V–Zr and Cr–Zr clusters in cases in which hydrated oxide supports are used.
Electron Crystallography and its Application to the Determination of the Structure of a Complex Zeolite, IM-5
The approach of electron crystallography entails solving the structure of many small crystals in three dimensions using both the diffracted beams and the image formed in an electron microscope. The incoming beam is focused onto a small part of the specimen and then a selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is recorded using the aperture at the image plane. One for the great advantages of solving 3D structures by electron crystallography is that the beams that form the diffraction patterns may be refocused to form an image (the electron micrograph). This electron micrograph is, in essence, a hologram constructed from the diffracted beams and contains all the information about the relative phases of the beams, that is, the micrograph is a result of both the reconstructed amplitude and relative phases of the diffracted beam. The process is depicted in Figure 11.

Because the crystallography is carried out in the electron microscope, the 3D structural determination can be concerned with minute regions of the crystal of differing chemical composition, a feature that is of growing importance in the study of new solid catalysts of complicated stoichiometry. The method operates by using suitable regions of the electron micrograph rather than the electron diffraction pattern itself5, 33, 34 (this is known, rather inelegantly, as a selected-area Fourier diffractogram, SAFD). The micrograph, in effect, becomes the ‘crystal’ from which the structure is solved. In practice, micrographs are recorded along several suitable zone axes, and very thin sections (to avoid multiple scattering) are selected. This technique is particularly useful in solving the structures of mesoporous solids, typified by MCM-48,34 in which, because their unit cell dimensions are so large and the walls of the “vacancy lattice” (composed of large channels and cages) are amorphous, the structures are nearly impossible to be solved by X-ray crystallography. Structure solutions algorithms developed for X-ray crystallography (e.g., direct methods or charge-flipping) can be used also with electron intensities but care must be taken to avoid dynamical effects if conventional SAED patterns are used; for zeolites, such effects tend to be weak.35
IM-5 (Si288−mO576−2m) is a crystalline siliceous zeolite catalyst, one of the most complex (structurally) with 24 silicon atoms in the asymmetric unit.36 Its unit cell dimensions are: a=14.334, b=56.92, c=20.327 Å, space group Cmcm. It is a so-called high-silica zeolite, exhibiting strong Brønsted catalytic activity in the cracking of hydrocarbons and also in the reduction of NO.37 Its synthesis was first reported in 1998,38 but only recently has its structure been determined.36, 39 It is an important nanoporous catalyst because it governs the precise nature (i.e., shape and size) of the product molecules that may be formed within it during the process of thermal cracking of hydrocarbons.
Recently, X-ray powder diffraction has been combined with electron crystallography to determine the structures of several complex zeolite catalysts such as TNU-9,39 SSZ-74,40 and ITQ-37,41, 42 and the advantages of doing so have been emphasized by Sun et al.38 Electron crystallography alone has been used to determine the structure of a large range polycrystalline compounds, especially nano- and micro-sized intermetallic compounds and metal clusters.44, 45
The structure of IM-5 was determined36, 39 by combining SAED, 3D reconstruction of HRTEM images from different zone axes and distance least squares (DLS) refinement.46 The unit cell parameters were determined from SAED; the space group from extinctions in these patterns and from the projection symmetries of HRTEM images such as those shown in Figure 12 for the high-symmetry directions <100>.

Using the structure factor amplitudes and phases of 144 independent reflections obtained from the images shown in Figure 12, a 3D electrostatic potential map was calculated by inverse Fourier transformation (Figure 13). From this 3D potential map, all 24 unique Si positions could be determined. Oxygen atoms were added between each SiSi pair and further refined together with the Si positions by DLS refinement. The final structure model (Figure 14) deviates on average 0.16 Å for Si and 0.31 Å for O atom from the structure refined by X-ray powder diffractometry.

Precession Electron Diffraction and Its Potential in Solving the Structure of New Catalysts
The vast majority of crystal structures are determined by X-ray diffraction. The interaction of an X-ray with the crystal charge density is sufficiently strong to yield diffraction data with high signal-to-noise but weak enough to be described as kinematical in nature. In this kinematical limit, the intensities of reflections are proportional to the square of the structure factor for that reflection and this has huge advantages in solving crystal structures. The interaction of an electron, with the crystal potential is in general far stronger, intensities of reflections are ‘dynamical’ and are dominated by multiple scattering events. For many years, electron microscopists have devised methods to minimize dynamical effects to allow electron diffraction to be used for structure solution. These methods have included using ultrathin or weakly scattering crystals, as discussed above, using high voltage instruments, but in this case for many materials beam damage can be a limiting factor, or using weak reflections that are quasi-kinematical in nature, such as high order Laue zone (HOLZ) reflections at major zone axes.47
In 1994, Vincent and Midgley introduced a technique that involved rocking the beam to give hollow cone illumination onto the specimen and then de-rocking the beam back onto the optic axis below the specimen (Figure 15).48 This double-rocking idea developed from a similar ‘double-rocking’ method, introduced by Eades49 and Crewe a few years previously,50 and capitalized on the possibilities offered by hollow cone illumination.51

Precession electron diffraction method (left), and a precession diffraction pattern recorded at the [001] axis of Er2Ge2O7 (right).48
The hollow cone rocking–derocking action has a net effect equivalent to a (focused) stationary beam but with a crystal precessing about the optic axis, as one would find in X-ray precession experiments;52 this similarity led to the technique being called ‘precession electron diffraction’. Importantly, the precession effect means that the Ewald sphere is swept through the Bragg condition and so the intensities recorded are ‘integrated intensities’ which are less susceptible to dynamical effects.53 Moreover, although the diffraction pattern geometry has the same appearance as a zone axis pattern, the beam is tilted away from the zone axis by the precession angle. This further reduces the dynamical perturbations to the reflections. Figure 15 shows a diagram of the precession technique together with one of the original precessed patterns recorded from the [001] zone axis of Er2Ge2O7.
The circular patch of reflections in the zero-order Laue zone (ZOLZ) has a radius equal to twice the precession angle, and the width of the annulus of reflections in the HOLZ is equal to the precession angle. There are four key advantages of the precession technique:
1.
The precession action leads to many more reflections being visible in both the ZOLZ and HOLZ. The Ewald sphere is rocked backwards and forwards (twice) through the reflection and many more reflections are excited compared to a conventional pattern.
2.
The diffracted discs are of uniform intensity and are not dominated by the complex contrast seen, for example, in conventional CBED patterns. The precession action leads to intensities integrated through the Bragg condition.
3.
With the beam tilted away from the zone axis, the dynamical interactions are minimized but the geometry of the zone axis pattern is preserved.
4.
A highly focused beam can be retained to enable diffraction data to be collected from small crystallites.
The use of precession electron diffraction for structure solution has been growing in recent years. There have been a number of studies of complex oxide systems including minerals (e.g., beryl, andalusite, cordierite, uvarovite, åkaermanite and mordenite), other mixed metal oxides including (Ga,In)2SnO4, Ba6Mn5O15, and La4Cu3MoO12, and studies of intermetallic systems such as Al-Fe and Al-Mg-Zn. In the catalysis field, electron diffraction has been applied for many years to zeolite and related structures, known to be difficult to solve with conventional X-ray methods. Dorset, in particular, has pioneered the use of electron diffraction in the study of zeolites, and recently used precession electron diffraction, to solve many previously unknown or partially known structures.54 Figure 16 shows a precession pattern recorded from MCM68, together with the structure solution found using the maximum entropy algorithm MICE.55

McCusker and Baerlocher have also recently combined precession electron diffraction with powder X-ray diffraction and high resolution imaging to solve zeolite structures ZSM-5 and TNU-9.56
The probe size of a convergent beam in precession varies approximately as the square of the precession angle and linearly with the spherical aberration coefficient of the probe-forming lens. In order to reduce the effects of multiple scattering, and thus to record usable electron diffraction intensities, the precession angle has to be relatively large (typically 2–3°). Thus, in most electron microscopes, this means the probe size may be 10’s of nm in diameter on the specimen.
If ultra-small particles are to be studied, then the probe size can be reduced by using aberration-corrected lenses. In principle, this can lead to a probe size of approximately 1 nm or less (limited only by higher order aberrations), ideal for the study of catalyst nanoparticles. In practice, the electronics of the scan system will need upgrading to reach that theoretical minimum. However, this is technically possible and so we have in the very near future the exciting prospect of recording precession patterns from, and thus solving crystal structures of, nm-sized catalyst crystals.
The Merits of Electron Tomography and Electron Holography
Many complex devices and materials are three-dimensional in nature at many different length scales. A large fraction of catalysts used are highly porous structures with complex 3D structural networks and particle distributions. These are often challenging structures to investigate by electron microscopy, and electron tomography has proven to be a very powerful tool in unraveling the 3D structure at the nanoscale. Electron tomography57 is a method by which a series of images (projections) are acquired, normally about a single tilt axis, so that the 3D structure is viewed from many directions. The ensemble of images within the tilt series is then ‘back-projected’ into a 3D space and the object is reconstructed. The reconstruction (or tomogram) can then be visualized in many ways, including an isosurface render to pick out a particular phase, a volume projection to visualize the 3D mass thickness of the object and by taking slices, to reveal clearly internal structures, such as second phases and pore distributions.
Early electron tomography experiments used a tilt series of bright-field images but very quickly it became apparent that STEM HAADF imaging was the image mode of choice for the study of catalysts.58 The great advantages of STEM HAADF imaging are two-fold. Firstly, the STEM HAADF images are incoherent in nature, meaning that such images are far less prone to contrast reversals with changes to thickness and defocus, compared to bright field (BF) (coherent) imaging. Secondly, the STEM HAADF images have high atomic contrast; in the limit this varies as the square of the atomic number, approaching Rutherford-type scattering. This is of course extremely useful in seeing ultra-small metallic nanoparticles in light element supports, as is often needed in the study of heterogeneous catalysts.
We show here three case studies highlighting the application of STEM HAADF tomography to the study of heterogeneous catalysts. In the first case, see Figure 17, we show how the reconstructed tomogram of Pd/Ru nanoparticles supported on and within disordered mesoporous silica.59 Here, the particles are colored red and silica grey. A study of the underlying support showed that the pore surface was fractal in nature which can have consequences for the selectivity of reactions under certain conditions.60 Furthermore, it was found that the distribution of the bimetallic nanoparticles was not random and that there was a very strong preference for the particles to anchor themselves to surface features which had strong negative Gaussian curvature (in other words ‘saddle points’). Such fine-scale 3D information is just not possible to achieve by any other technique.

As a second example, the electron tomography of an ordered mesoporous silica, MCM48 is shown in Figure 18.61 This had been studied by more conventional electron microscopy, forming lattice images (see previous sections) from which the gyroid pore structure was determined. By recording STEM HAADF images, the 3D reconstruction confirmed the gyroid structure and the overall symmetry of the MCM48 structure. Differences were seen although in the pore size determination. 3D real space crystallography of this kind also allows defects to be seen, and a ‘twin’ boundary was discovered in MCM48, with a common {112} twin plane.

Lastly, electron tomography is adept at visualizing the faceting of nanocrystals. In Figure 19, we show a reconstruction of heavy metal oxide catalysts based on (Ce/Tb/Zr)O2−x with Au nanoparticles decorating the surface. The ceria facets are predominantly composed of {111} crystal faces but equally interesting is the observation that the Au nanoparticles occupy preferentially the ‘crevices’ formed by the facet structure.62

There are many electron imaging modes available for electron tomography. One with a great deal of potential is that of volume-spectroscopy63 or 4D spectral tomography in which energy loss is combined with the three spatial dimensions. One of the great benefits is that spectral information can be extracted from subvolumes avoiding any projection artifacts.
Nowadays, many catalysts are designed such that they have a ferromagnetic core (of Fe or Co) covered with a coating of either carbon or silica, to which are attached the active centers that impart the activity to the entire composite. The merit in doing this devolved upon the ease of separation (magnetically) of the catalyst itself (for further use) from the mixture of products and unconverted reactant species. A striking example of the implementation of this concept is contained in the work of Lu et al.64 (Figure 20) who nanoengineered a magnetically separable hydrogenation catalyst. These workers used carbon (as a coating for the ferromagnetic cobalt particles) and also as a support for metallic palladium, which constitutes the hydrogenating center. Electron holography assists in characterizing such catalysts.

Some Insights into Auto-Exhaust Catalysts
The work of Calvino et al.65 on the oxygen storage capacity of CeO2-based solids that are used in a three-way, auto-exhaust catalyst has benefited enormously from investigations involving HREM (STEM) and electron tomography. Typically, a composition such as Ce0.68Zr0.32O2 releases its oxygen (from within the bulk) when heated in H2 up to 900 °C, and it does so initially at temperatures in the vicinity of 700 K. However, when some 0.3 % of Rh is distributed over the surface of this (Ce–Zr)O2 support, it is seen that on heating again, the oxygen from the bulk is released at approximately 450 K. A spillover process occurs on the Rh and the dissociated hydrogen combine with the oxygen from the bulk, thereby creating vacancies.
HREM has proven invaluable in the hands of Calvino and collaborators in elucidating the nature of this kind of phenomenon. In particular, an in-depth structural and analytical investigation of two 25 wt % Ce0.8Pr0.2O2 (supported on δ-Al2O3) catalysts (with 3.5 wt % SiO2 and 4 wt % La2O3) was performed by Lopez-Haro et al.66 in which they aimed at clarifying the origin of the difference in evolution of their oxygen storage capacity with temperature. Using a combination of TEM and STEM, the details of the structural and compositional changes of the two catalysts with reduction temperature established the role of SiO2 as a stabilizer of the oxygen handling properties of the Ce–Pr mixed oxide phase under high temperature reducing environments. Pr does not fully mix with Ce during the synthesis of both catalysts and the SiO2 doping provides a barrier against lanthanide element incorporation into the alumina support. This hinders the formation of LnAlO3 (Ln=Ce, Pr) perovskite thought responsible for the loss of oxygen storage capacity during hydrogen treatments at temperatures above 800 °C.
The Value of Electron Energy-Loss Spectro- scopy (EELS)
By adding an electron spectrometer to either a STEM or a TEM instrument, a great deal of extra structural information about the specimen may be extracted. For example, the wealth of information schematized in Figure 21 is retrievable. The range of energies over which reasonable signals may be obtained extends to about 2000 eV below the incident energy. Proceeding from the zero-loss peak, the first feature of interest is the plasmon peak, which usually occurs between about 5 and 25 eV. Since plasmons are collective excitations of the electron gas, their energies are governed by the density of the electron in the sample, and the extent to which the electrons are free or bound. π- or σ-electrons have different energies; and one often readily distinguishes between a surface and a bulk plasmon. Plasmon resonance can be triggered either by light irradiation or by electromagnetic fields associated with impinging electrons.

Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and imaging provides a wealth of information including chemical composition, valence state (or oxidation number obtained from ELNES), interatomic distances (obtained from EXELFS), information pertaining to σ and π electrons (obtained from plasmon peaks) and momentum density of bonding electrons (obtained from Compton scattering).10
At higher energy loss, the electron intensity is much weaker and the features are analogous to the absorption edges found in X-ray absorption spectra, and they arise from scattering of the transmitted electrons by inner-shell (core) electrons of each element present in the specimen.
The great merit of EELS and electron-loss imaging in STEM and energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) is the information pertaining to composition and structure they yield: valence states, bond distances, and composition may all, under ideal conditions, be retrieved from the kind of spectra schematized in Figure 21. The number of d electrons in a transition metal or platinum group metal ion, coordination fingerprints and bond-mapping as well as bond-distances may all, under favorable circumstances, be deduced from EELS spectra (see Refs. 5 and Ref. 10).
Owing to the very recent availability of high-intensity, sharply focused (ca. 1 Å diameter) electron beams operating within AC-STEM instruments, truly atomic-scale chemical imaging is now possible, as recently demonstrated by Muller et al.67 who examined perovskite layers (Figure 22).

Such a development augurs well for the future of electron microscope studies of a wide variety of oxide catalysts, especially those based on novel perovskites now used increasingly in photocatalysis.68 Because of the availability of AC-STEM instruments an increase of some 100-fold in the signal becomes possible compared with what was achievable prior to their advent. New possibilities in EELS studies are discussed in the following sections.
4D Electron Microscopy
Four-dimensional (4D) ultrafast (stroboscopic) electron microscopy became feasible some five years ago, thanks to the efforts of Zewail and co-workers.69 Similar efforts have been made to develop ultrafast single-shot experiments at the Lawrence Livermore labs, known as dynamic TEM, or DTEM.70 It is an approach that adds the dimensions of time to the three spatial ones that are retrievable by HREM; and it has opened up new vistas and applications by using timed, single-electron (or just a few electron) packets. The full details of the Zewail approach71 and the variety of recent applications10 have been described elsewhere. Real-space imaging, Fourier-space (diffraction pattern) recording and EELS studies may all be carried out at femtosecond (fs) scale resolution. All this is achieved through coherent electron packets, which are liberated from a photocathode with femtosecond laser pulses, accelerated at 120 or 200 keV, and contain as little as one electron per pulse (Figure 24).

Reference 10 is a monograph that deals in depth with the principles and applications (up to late 2009) of 4D EM; and the reader is referred to that text to see, amongst others, how EELS spectra may be collected at subpicosecond time scales.72 That text also shows how convergent beam (CB) recording and electron energy-gain measurements are carried out.73
Many remarkable results have already been attained by Zewail’s 4D microscopy approach. However, the concerted study of catalysts has not yet begun. The fs-resolved EELS data recently recorded by Carbone et al.74, 75 using Zewail’s ultrafast electron microscope operating in the single-electron per pulse mode uses a train of 220 fs infrared laser pulses (λ=1038 nm), which is split into two paths (Figure 23). One path is frequency-doubled and used to excite the specimen on the microscope grid, and the other is frequency-tripled into the UV and directed to the photoemissive cathode to generate the electron packets. Full details of the way the EELS data and parallel information are recorded are given in Refs. 74 and Ref. 75.

Carbone et al.,74, 75 on examining graphite, observed non-equilibrium compression and subsequent expansion of the graphene layers, and is correlated with the direction of change from sp2 to sp3 (i.e., to 3D-diamond-like structure) electronic hybridization. With the reality of achieving even shorter optical pulse,76 the Zewail group provided the methodology to generate attosecond (10−18 s) electron pulses for imaging and for EELS, that is, on the time-scale at which electrons move. With such spatial and temporal resolutions, one has reached the ultimate scale of discrimination in bond lengths and angles and also in the movement of bonding electrons. In principle, therefore, unprecedented degrees of insight into the processes that occur at the surface of catalysts after the transfer of electrons to or from the reactant species and the solid catalyst become possible.
Time-resolved in situ studies of catalysts by electron microscopy
In addition to the picometer (spatial resolution) coupled with femtosecond (time resolution) that is an inherent feature of Zewail’s 4D electron microscopy, which has yet to be applied to a dynamic study of solid catalysts, there have been many successes in probing catalytic action at more modest time scales but at even higher spatial resolutions than have been achieved with 4D EM. Substantial progress has been made by Gai, Helveg, Henry, Allard, Yacaman, Creemer, and others in designing TEM systems that permit HREM images to be recorded of solid catalysts undergoing dynamic changes under modest (reduced) gas pressures.
Gai77 has perfected her in situ E-TEM approach in such a manner as to achieve atomic resolution in the imaging of nanoparticles (specifically Pt on TiO2) participating in catalytic turnover. The highest degree of time resolution so far attained by Gai and co-workers falls in the range of milliseconds. However, her instrument can routinely be employed to cope with gas pressures of up to 50 000 Pa of H2. Figure 24 shows a selective oxidation catalyst (known as CoAlPO-3678), which remains structurally stable up to about 400 °C at this relatively high-pressure (50 000 Pa) of H2.
One especially important aspect of heterogeneous catalysts, concerned with nanoparticle shape dynamics, is of considerable current interest. The size, shapes, and detailed surface structure of supported metal nanoparticles (such as Cu/ZrO in the synthesis of methanol from CO/CO2/H2 mixtures) play a key role in their catalytic performance. Although nanoparticles with predefined shapes can be readily synthesized, there is no guarantee that such materials remain stable when exposed to reaction conditions. In this regard, the work of Hansen et al., shown in Figure 25, is of particular relevance.79

Currently, Gai and Boyes80 are engaged in adapting a JEOL AC-STEM/TEM instrument to cope with environmental electron microscopy in the in situ sense outlined above.
A significant advance in environmental (in situ) TEM has been registered recently in a joint Dutch–Danish collaboration reported by Creemer et al.81 The strategy used by these workers (in order to limit the number of gas atoms in the specimen stage of the microscope) was to build a novel nanoreactor that is functionalized with micrometer-sized gas-flow channels, electron-transparent windows (made of amorphous SiNx) and a special heating device (Figure 26).

This micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) approach enables the integration of a heater and a thermal sensor for variable-temperature experiments at a subsecond time scale. A comparable advance, also using MEMS technology, has been made by Allard and Yacaman et al.82
Future Prospects
There are many growth points in electron microscopy that will lead to further advances in the elucidation of the nature and properties of novel catalysts. On the purely instrumental side, the so-called SMART project centered in Berlin is concerned, among others, with producing a spectro-microscope with lateral resolution of 2 nm with an energy resolution of 100 meV; both spherical and chromatic aberration is corrected, it is energy filtered and combines low energy electron microscopy (LEEM) and photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM), using an X-ray synchrotron as the source of radiation. Another significant development in this area is that pioneered by Asakura and his colleagues83 involving an aberration-corrected multipole Wien filter for energy-filtered X-ray PEEM.
PEEM, using UV light as a source, proved immensely valuable in the hands of Ertl and collaborators84 in investigating the dynamics of surface reactions on model catalysts, in which the various ‘chaotic’ and well-behaved features of reactants at surfaces could be followed from the local changes of work function during reactions
Ultralow-energy excitations and prospects for spatially-resolved spectroscopy
With the availability of monochromated electron sources, there is increasing interest in using energy loss spectroscopy to study ultralow-energy excitations. Howie first discussed the possibility of photon-assisted EELS to investigate excitations generated by a tuned photon beam or pulse train.[85] Energy gain spectroscopy is then possible, discussed further theoretically by Garcia de Abajo and Kociak86 and realized experimentally by Zewail’s group.73
Au and Ag nanoparticles exhibit a fascinating array of low energy modes that can be probed with monochromated EELS. The low energy of the excitations however means that the signal collected is delocalized, possibly over several tens of nanometers. One way to improve the localization of such a signal is to acquire only those electrons that have scattered to relatively high angles. Such energy-filtered low-loss STEM (EF-STEM) HAADF imaging is possible in some instruments and one of the first examples of this is shown in Figure 27 from the Stuttgart group87 using their SESAM instrument.

The need to prepare monodispersed nanocrystals and nanoclusters of catalysts
As we have indicated elsewhere,88 when bimetallic or trimetallic nanoclusters need to be prepared for catalytic testing, a reliable procedure is to use a precursor organometallic molecule (or ion) in which the two (or three) metals are an integral part of the structure of that precursor. The organo component of the precursor molecule is readily removed (by gentle thermolysis or oxidation at low temperature, for example) so as to yield the desired, monodisperse catalyst. This is the method we have used for systems such as Ru10Pt2C2, Ru5PtC, and Pd6Ru6.88, 89 The same strategy was used by Turner et al.90 in their study of nanocluster-nanoparticle gold, whereby they took a Au55 compound as a precursor.
The whole question of catalytic activity and cluster size in gold catalysis is still a deeply enigmatic issue. Thus the recent work of Tsukuda and co-workers91 on the dependence of catalytic activity as a function of size (in the range 1.0 to 9.5 nm), which straddles the cluster–particle divide, for some of the reactions shown in Scheme 2 is given in Figure 28; we see that the rate constants fall dramatically with increasing size of the Au cluster nanoparticle. In the Au preparations of Tsukuda and co-workers, such as that of many other workers in this field (i.e., Ref. 92), the Au clusters are partially covered with weakly bound poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidine) (PVP), which still allow sufficient access of reactants to bare regions of the Au surface. Tsukuda very recently studied a series of Au preparations in which ‘magic numbers’ of atoms were stabilized by PVP, and studied them using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS).93 He concluded that the reactivity of magic numbers smaller than 70 atoms are broadly in line with those of free clusters (in the gas phase).

An altogether different approach to the preparation of nanosized metals has recently been described by Zheng and co-workers.94 These workers employed an in situ TEM approach, in which the growth trajectories of Pt nanoparticle colloids (stabilized by a surfactant) were investigated, using a liquid cell that operates inside a TEM;95, 96 these workers showed that nanocrystals of Pt can grow either by monomer attachment from solution or by particle coalescence. Through the combination of these two processes, an initially broad size distribution can spontaneously narrow into a nearly monodisperse distribution (Figure 29).

With these two distinct modes of preparation, the role of advanced HREM studies will take further significance in pinning down precisely the roles of the enhanced catalytic performance of nanocluster metallic or bimetallic entities.
Epilogue
There are many other growth points in electron microscopy that could well have an impact on the study of solid catalysts. One of these is low voltage STEM, such as proposed in the SALVE project,97 sometimes entitled ‘Gentle STEM’, a term associated with the recent work of Krivanek et al.98 This technique refers to the practice of recording annular dark field (ADF) images and EELS at low primary energies of the electron beam, a feature made possible by the aberration correction of the STEM instruments. It is now possible to reach probe sizes close to 1 Å at 60 keV, that is, at an operating energy that avoids direct knock-on damage in materials consisting of light elements such as boron, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. Krivanek et al. have shown that their approach allows chemical identification of individual atoms, both heavy and light, and the recording of atomic motion of individual heavy atoms (Figure 30).
