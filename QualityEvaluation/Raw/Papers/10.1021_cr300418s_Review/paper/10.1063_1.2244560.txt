We consider a general class of hybrid density functionals with decomposition of the exchange component into short-range and long-range parts. The admixture of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange is controlled by three parameters: short-range mixing, long-range mixing, and range separation. We study how the variation of these parameters affects the accuracy of hybrid functionals for thermochemistry and kinetics. For the density functional component of the hybrids, we test three nonempirical approximations: local spin-density approximation, generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and meta-GGA. We find a great degree of flexibility in choosing the mixing parameters in range-separated hybrids. For the studied properties, short-range and long-range HF exchange seem to have a similar effect on the errors. One may choose to treat the long-range portion of the exchange by HF to recover the correct asymptotic behavior of the exchange potential and improve the description of density tail regions. If this asymptote is not important, as in solids, one may use screened hybrids, where long-range HF exchange is excluded. Screened hybrids retain most of the benefits of global hybrids but significantly reduce the computational cost in extended systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
The wide popularity of Kohn-Sham density functional theory1 (DFT) as an electronic structure tool is by a large part due to the remarkable accuracy of hybrid density functionals for a wide range of molecular properties. In a hybrid functional,2–4 a certain portion of exact exchange is admixed to one of the common density functional approximations (DFA) for the exchange-correlation (xc) energy. Exact exchange in Kohn-Sham DFT is defined by the same formal expression as in Hartree-Fock (HF) theory. In this work, we will use the terms “Hartree-Fock” and “exact” exchange interchangeably. In the conventional one-parameter mixing scheme,4 the xc energy is written as

The value of the mixing parameter
a
0
can sometimes be set a priori based on theoretical arguments,2,5 but in most cases it is fitted to training data sets. The optimal value of
a
0
can differ significantly depending on the property we wish to compute and on the particular DFA used. In the hybrid of the local spin-density approximation (LSDA), as much as 50% of Hartree-Fock exchange is needed to obtain acceptable thermochemistry.2 A smaller fraction of HF exchange is generally used in the hybrids of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals. It can be theoretically reasoned that
a
0
≈
0.25
should be optimal for predicting atomization energies by GGA hybrids.5 Using the GGA of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof6 (PBE) in Eq. (1) with
a
0
=
0.25
has proven particularly successful.7,8 This hybrid is usually known under the acronyms of PBEh, PBE0, or PBE1PBE. In the hybrids of meta-GGA functionals, an even smaller value of
a
0
is typically used. For the meta-GGA of Tao, Perdew, Staroverov, and Scuseria (TPSS),9 the recommended one-parameter hybrid10 uses
a
0
=
0.1
⁠. When we ascend the ladder of DFT approximations,11 the exchange functionals become more accurate and hence a smaller amount of the exact exchange would in principle be needed in the corresponding hybrids. Besides general-purpose hybrids, exemplified above, there are specialized hybrids intended for a particular narrow purpose. For example, a proper description of transition states of chemical reactions requires admixture of a larger fraction of HF exchange than is optimal for regular thermochemistry.12,13
A hybrid of Eq. (1), where
a
0
is a constant, is referred to as a “global hybrid.” A more general exchange mixing technique is a so-called “local hybrid,”14 where the mixing parameter is not a constant but some function of coordinates, which is used to mix exchange energy densities at each point in space. Local hybrids have not been widely used, mainly because they are nontrivial to implement.
The focus of this work is on hybrid functionals involving separation of the exchange component into short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) parts. Such a decomposition can be accomplished by splitting the Coulomb operator with the help of the standard error function (erf),15,16
(2)
where
ω
is a parameter defining the range of the separation. At a distance of about
2
∕
ω
the short-range interactions become negligible. The choice of the splitting function is not unique, but the error function is convenient because it allows analytic evaluation of two-electron repulsion integrals in Gaussian basis sets. For a given
ω
⁠, we can split HF and DFA exchange as
E

The parameters
a
and
b
in Eq. (5) can be adjusted (between 0 and 1) for different purposes. For instance, setting
b
=
0
excludes the long-range portion of HF exchange. Such “exchange screening” greatly reduces computational cost for extended systems, especially for systems with a small band gap.17–19 This technique enables hybrid DFT calculations on bulk metals, where conventional Hartree-Fock or global hybrid calculations are intractable. A PBE-based screened hybrid was recently developed and tested by Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE).17–20 HSE has been proven to be a powerful tool for solid state studies.19,21,22 A screened hybrid built from the TPSS meta-GGA is currently being tested.23 
With a totally different goal in mind, it has been suggested to treat the long-range part of the exchange interaction entirely by Hartree-Fock (which means setting
b
=
1
⁠).24–26 In this scheme,
E
x
LR
-
HF
serves as an “asymptotic correction” for the exchange potential. This method was shown to improve such properties as polarizabilities of long chains,24,27 charge transfer and Rydberg excitations,25 nonlinear optical properties,28 and dissociation of 2-center 3-electron bonds.26 It can also be utilized to describe the repulsive part of van der Waals potentials.29–34 In some cases, the long-range correction can affect thermochemical performance of a functional.35 Hence, it has been proposed to lift the
b
=
1
restriction and fit the parameters
a
and
b
independently, aiming for better accuracy at the price of losing the exact asymptotics.35,36
A scheme similar to Eq. (5) can be used to combine DFT at short range with a correlated wave-function method at long range.32–34,37,38 This technique requires SR-LR decomposition not only in the exchange component but also in the correlation part,16,39 to avoid double counting of the same correlation effects. SR-LR splitting of the correlation component is not considered in this study.
In this work, we study how variation of the parameters in Eq. (5) influences the performance of this mixing scheme for thermochemistry and kinetics. More specifically, we investigate what part of Hartree-Fock exchange, short range or long range, is responsible for better performance of hybrid functionals.
II. METHODOLOGY
To get an idea about acceptable ranges of the parameters in Eq. (5), we consider several limiting cases. When
a
=
b
⁠, the energy does not depend on
ω
and Eq. (5) reduces to a global hybrid of Eq. (1). For
ω
=
0
⁠, the hybrid of Eq. (5) becomes a regular global hybrid (1) with the mixing parameter
a
⁠. In the limit
ω
→
∞
⁠, the hybrid of Eq. (5) reduces to a global hybrid with the mixing parameter
b
⁠. In practical calculations, the value of
ω
is usually chosen in a relatively narrow range. Some typical values of
ω
(in
a.u.
−
1
⁠) are
ω
=
0.15
in Refs. 17–19 (but note Ref. 20),
ω
=
0.33
in Refs. 25, 28, 30, 35, and 36 (our
ω
corresponds to their
μ
⁠),
ω
=
0.4
in Ref. 24, and
ω
=
0.5
in Refs. 26, 32, and 33.
When the error function is used in Eq. (2), the transition between the short-range and the long-range parts is very smooth. Note also that, as
r
approaches zero,
erf
(
ω
r
)
∕
r
does not go to zero but to a constant
2
ω
∕
π
⁠. In other words, short-range interactions are not completely removed from the long-range part. In Ref. 40,
erf
(
ω
r
)
∕
r
is actually referred to as “background,” rather than “long-range” interaction. Alternative types of
1
∕
r
splitting have been proposed, such as the so-called “erfgau” interaction,16,39,40 which provides a sharper SR-LR separation. In the erfgau splitting, the long-range interaction goes to zero in the limit
r
→
0
⁠. Different types of SR-LR splitting functions, such as erfgau, may be an interesting direction for future research, but in this work, we limit our attention to the standard error function to facilitate comparisons with previous studies.
The short-range and long-range components of an exchange DFA can be straightforwardly derived, if the expression for the corresponding exchange hole is known. Given a spherically averaged exchange hole
h

⁠, the short-range part of the exchange energy is evaluated as

We have implemented and tested the SR and LR components for three exchange DFAs. The short-range Dirac/Slater exchange functional (which we will denote as SR-LSDA) was derived15,41 a decade ago and it is easy to implement. The SR-PBE exchange was obtained using the model PBE exchange hole,42 as described in Refs. 17 and 18. The TPSS exchange hole has been recently engineered43 and used to implement the corresponding SR component.23 The details of the implementation of all the terms in Eq. (5) can be found in Refs. 17, 18, and 23 
We note that a derivation analogous to Eq. (6) cannot be used for most of the available DFAs, since the explicit expression for the exchange hole
h
x
DFA
(
r
,
u
)
is usually unknown. In fact, most of the studies of SR (or LR) GGAs use various approximations. An approximate SR component of an exchange functional can be derived by interpolation from SR-LSDA.16,24,25 Other approximate strategies for deriving the SR components of GGA functionals have also been reported.34,39 We are currently conducting a comparative study of the accuracy of these approximations.44 
In all our hybrids, correlation components are used in an unaltered form. In LSDA hybrids, we use the correlation energy as parameterized by Perdew and Wang.45 PBE-based hybrids use the standard PBE correlation,6 and TPSS hybrids use the corresponding correlation component.9 All the hybrid functionals considered in this study are exact in the uniform density limit.
All benchmark calculations reported in this work have been performed self-consistently in the GAUSSIAN suite of programs46 using the

In some cases, mean errors (ME) and standard deviations (SD) are also reported. All figures are plotted as smooth interpolations between discrete values of parameters. The parameters

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Enthalpies of formation
Predicting accurate enthalpies of formation (or atomization energies) has traditionally been one of the major survival criteria in the natural selection of constantly appearing exchange-correlation approximations. In fact, a set of standard enthalpies of formation is often used to fit parameters in semiempirical functionals. Hybrid functionals hold the leading position in this “survival of the fittest” contest. Admixture of HF exchange has long been an effective means of improving thermochemical performance.3,4 In this section we try to determine which part of HF exchange is mainly responsible for this gain in accuracy: short range or long range.
As a benchmark set of standard enthalpies of formation
(
Δ
f
H
298
o
)
⁠, we use the G2-1 set of 55 small molecules.47 The geometries and zero-point energies are obtained at the
B
3
LYP
∕
6
-
31
G
(
2

,
p
)
level. A frequency scale factor of 0.9854 is used in calculation of zero-point energies and thermal corrections. We find enthalpies of formation of molecules by calculating the atomization energies and employing the experimental enthalpies of formation of free atoms. Hence, the errors reported in this section reflect the errors in computed atomization energies.
The comparison of the performance of pure DFAs for the enthalpies of formation reveals how the errors are reduced while ascending the ladder of xc approximations. For the G2-1 set, the MAE of LSDA is
36
kcal
∕
mol
⁠, while it is
8
kcal
∕
mol
in PBE and just
4.5
kcal
∕
mol
in TPSS. Figure 1 shows the errors of the global hybrids of Eq. (1) for the G2-1 set as a function of the HF exchange mixing parameter. In the hybrid of LSDA, the best performance is attained with about 50% of HF exchange: the MAE is lowered to
9.4
kcal
∕
mol
⁠. For the PBE hybrid, the typically used value of
a
0
=
0.25
provides optimal accuracy with a MAE of only
2.9
kcal
∕
mol
⁠. In the case of TPSS, an admixture of HF exchange does not lead to any considerable improvement for the G2-1 set.

Next, we consider range-separated hybrids, where the long-range exchange is described by Hartree-Fock, that is
a
=
0
and
b
=
1
in Eq. (5). Figure 2 shows how this “long-range correction” influences the errors in the enthalpies of formation. The
ω
dependence of the errors is quite different for LSDA, PBE, and TPSS hybrids, but is quite reminiscent of the
a
0
dependence in the global hybrids (Fig. 1). In the LSDA curve in Fig. 2, there is a deep minimum around
ω
=
0.55
with MAE of
8.0
kcal
∕
mol
⁠. This result is consistent with the work of Gerber and Ángyán,26 within the difference in computational details. For PBE, the minimal MAE of
3.6
kcal
∕
mol
is obtained when
ω
=
0.35
⁠. The long-range correction method applied to TPSS provides no improvement for the enthalpies of formation, irrespective of the value of
ω
⁠.

is in

As Fig. 2 clearly demonstrates, the accuracy of LSDA for the G2-1 set can be greatly improved by replacing the long-range portion of exchange by Hartree-Fock. This may lead to the conclusion that
E
x
LR
-
HF
is the most important ingredient in LSDA hybrids. Indeed, Fig. 3(b) shows that in the range-separated hybrids with the admixture of only
E
x
LR
-
HF
⁠, minimal errors are found when
b
=
1
⁠. Thus, it is beneficial to replace
E
x
LR
-
LSDA
entirely by
E
x
LR
-
HF
⁠. However, Fig. 3(a)shows that it is also possible to substantially decrease the error by admixing only short-range HF exchange. For instance, a “screened hybrid” of LSDA with
ω
=
0.25
⁠,
a
=
0.6
⁠, and
b
=
0
has a MAE of
11.9
kcal
∕
mol
⁠.

a
=
0
(right).
Figure 4 shows how the errors in enthalpies of formation change upon varying parameters
a
and
b
in range-separated hybrids of PBE. Admixing short-range HF exchange alone [Fig. 4(a)], it is possible to bring the MAE down to
2.9
kcal
∕
mol
(⁠
ω
=
0.25
⁠,
a
=
0.25
⁠,
b
=
0
⁠). This minimum in Fig. 4(a) reproduces the corresponding minimum in Fig. 1 for the global hybrid of PBE with
a
0
=
0.25
⁠. In general, our studies show that the results of the PBEh global hybrid for thermochemistry are well reproduced by the corresponding screened hybrid if
ω
<
0.3
⁠. The latter observation was one of the justifications for the HSE functional.17,18 On the other hand, adding long-range HF exchange alone can also significantly reduce the errors [Fig. 4(b)]. So we cannot definitively say which part of HF exchange is more important for the hybrid: short range or long range. Either one of them can be used to improve thermochemical accuracy.

(right).
In the case of TPSS (Fig. 5), admixture of any portion of HF exchange, either at short range or at long range, does not reduce the MAE for the G2-1 set. However, variation of the parameter
b
changes the errors only slightly, which indicates that the total energy is less sensitive to the description of the long-range interactions.

B. Barrier heights of chemical reactions
Significant underestimation of reaction barrier heights is a well known deficiency of common DFAs. Transition states of chemical reactions are characterized by unusual, stretched bonds. In such systems, the self-interaction error of a DFA may be particularly large.48 A greater fraction of HF exchange (usually between 40% and 50%) is needed for a global hybrid functional to obtain accurate barrier heights.12,13 Becke’s half-and-half functional,2 one of the earliest and simplest hybrids, contains 50% of HF exchange and it is surprisingly successful in predicting barrier heights,49 despite being not very accurate for other properties.
A benchmark set of barrier heights was recently assembled by Truhlar and coworkers.13,50 It consists of the forward and reverse barrier heights for 21 reactions. We will refer to it as the BH42 set. The best estimates of the barrier heights as well as the geometries of all the species in the BH42 set, optimized with a correlated wave function method, are available from the database website of Lynch et al.50 
The performance of the pure functionals for barrier heights is improved going from LSDA
(
MAE
=
17.7
kcal
∕
mol
)
to PBE
(
MAE
=
9.4
kcal
∕
mol
)
to TPSS
(
MAE
=
8.1
kcal
∕
mol
)
⁠. But even the accuracy of TPSS is still unsatisfactory. Figure 6 shows the errors of the global hybrids for the BH42 set. Admixture of 55% of HF exchange to LSDA brings its error down to
2.2
kcal
∕
mol
⁠. We note that in LSDA global hybrids, about 50% of HF exchange is optimal for both enthalpies of formation and barrier heights. Global hybrids of PBE and TPSS are not that consistent: a significantly larger fraction of HF exchange is required to accurately predict barrier heights. Figure 6 shows that
a
0
=
0.5
is needed in the PBE hybrid, which gives the lowest MAE of just
1.5
kcal
∕
mol
⁠. TPSS global hybrid with
a
0
=
0.4
has MAE of
3.1
kcal
∕
mol
⁠.

MAE

2.3

Figures 8–10, for LSDA, PBE, and TPSS respectively, show how parameters

and

in Eq. (5) influence the errors in barriers heights. Just like in the case of enthalpies of formation, it is possible to reduce the errors in barrier heights by adding either short-range HF exchange alone or long-range HF exchange alone.

A more challenging task is finding such a set of parameters that works well for barrier heights and for enthalpies of formation and at the same time. As we mentioned above, global hybrids of beyond-LSDA functionals are not well fit for that. Long-range corrected functionals seem to be more successful. As Table I shows, a hybrid of PBE with
a
=
0
⁠,
b
=
1
⁠, and
ω
=
0.4
is consistetly accurate for barrier heights as well as for equilibrium thermochemistry. In fact, we were unable to find another combination of
a
⁠,
b
⁠, and
ω
⁠, that would perform better than long-range corrected PBE in terms of uniform accuracy for all studied properties.

It is interesting to note that the antipode of the latter functional, a PBE hybrid with

describes barrier heights reasonably well, but it is quite inaccurate for other properties (Table I).
C. Ionization potentials and electron affinities
In this section we only consider hybrids of PBE, since PBE seems to benefit the most from an admixture of HF exchange, as can be seen from Figs. 1, 2, 6, and 7.
All the benchmark calculations of ionization potentials (IPs) and electron affinities (EAs) were performed on the G2 ion test set.51 The calculations of the
H
2
S
+
and
N
2
+
cations do not converge with pure DFT methods51 and these two species were dropped from the set. Our test set thus comprises 86 ionization potentials and 58 electron affinities. IPs and EAs were evaluated as the difference in total energies at
0

of the ion and the corresponding neutral, at their respective

level with a frequency scale factor of 0.9854. This method is often called
Δ
SCF
⁠, to emphasize that two self-consistent field calculations are compared.
The mean absolute errors in IPs and EAs of the global hybrids of PBE are shown in Fig. 11. Ionization potentials are only slightly improved by the admixture of HF exchange. The dependence of the errors in IPs on the mixing parameter
a
0
is weak: with
a
0
ranging from 0 to 0.8, the MAE varies by less than
0.05
eV
⁠. For
0.2
⩽
a
0
⩽
0.5
⁠, the MAE nearly levels off at
0.20
eV
⁠.

Mean absolute errors in the ionization potentials and electron affinities of the G2 set as a function of the exchange mixing parameter in global hybrids of PBE.
EAs, on the other hand, do not benefit from the admixture of HF exchange. The error in EAs grows with increasing
a
0
⁠. This observation is somewhat counterintuitive. Pure DFAs predict positive highest occupied orbital energies in anions, meaning that the outermost electron is effectively unbound.52 Admixture of a certain amount of HF exchange makes all occupied orbital energies properly negative. However, as seen from Fig. 11, this is not accompanied by any improvement in
Δ
SCF
EAs. When a finite basis set is used, the highest occupied orbital seems artificially stabilized irrespective of the sign of the orbital eigenvalue. The success of pure DFAs in predicting EAs seems to rest on basis set effects and error cancellations, which do not necessarily comply to a theoretical justification.
Figure 12 presents the performance of the long-range corrected PBE hybrid for IPs and EAs. There is a shallow minimum in the IP curve at
ω
≈
0.35
with a MAE of
0.19
eV
⁠. For EAs, the long-range correction provides no improvement.

In Fig. 13(a), the results of screened PBE hybrids with

a

and

(right).
The following is a summary of the results for IPs and EAs: The error in IPs can be only slightly reduced by adding a fraction of HF exchange, either at short range, or at long range, or both. For EAs, an admixture of HF exchange in any form increases the errors. The best performance for electron affinities is achieved by the pure PBE.
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
It is no news that thermochemical accuracy of many approximate functionals can be improved by an admixture of HF exchange. Range-separated hybrids provide additional flexibility in the choice of the mixing scheme. HF exchange can be admixed either at long range, or at short range, or both. The particular mixing parameters can be chosen based on the properties of interest and specific systems studied. If one is interested in a good description of the asymptotic density regions of atoms and molecules, it is advisable to admix HF exchange at long range. When the long-range part is treated entirely by Hartree-Fock (“long-range correction”), one recovers the exact
−
1
∕
r
asymptotic behavior of the exchange potential. In solids, where there are no “density tails,” such a “correction” is not needed and it is most natural to use screened hybrids such as HSE. HSE retains most of the benefits of PBEh and at the same time saves a great deal of computational time in periodic systems, especially in metals and narrow band gap systems.
We have studied hybrids of three nonempirical xc approximations. LSDA and PBE benefit from the admixture of HF exchange much more than TPSS does. PBE-based hybrids are the most successful in every considered category: global, screened, and long-range corrected. In Figs. 1, 2, 6, and 7, PBE curves have the lowest minima. The errors of several representative PBE hybrids are summarized in Table I.
The long-range corrected hybrid of PBE with
ω
=
0.4
happens to work well for enthalpies of formation, barrier heights, and IPs. We have found no other combination with such consistent performance for all our benchmarks. The correct asymptote of the exchange potential, obtained with
b
=
1
⁠, may not be very important for these benchmark properties, but it is very important for other properties, such as charge transfer, which are the subject of our ongoing investigations.44 
The study of range-separated hybrids we have carried out here is by no means exhaustive. We have considered only a limited number of parameter combinations and tested them against a few medium-sized benchmark sets. Similar studies for properties other than thermochemistry may be an interesting direction to explore.

In Refs. 17–19, two errors were made in interpreting the value of the parameter

ω

In Ref. 18, we observed that the HSE functional is somewhat less accurate in predicting IPs and EAs than PBE or PBEh functionals. However, this behavior seems to be entirely attributed to the errors described in Ref. 20.
