INTRODUCTION
Styrene is one of the most important monomer for
synthetic polymers. More than 90 % of its world production
is obtained by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB).
Currently, the dehydrogenation of EB is carried out at 600-
700 ºC, just below the temperature where thermal cracking
becomes significant on the promoted iron oxide catalysts1,2.
Due to the highly endothermic and volume increasing character
of the reaction, a large amount of superheated steam is required
to supply heat, lower the partial pressure of the reactant, thus
shifting the chemical equilibrium to higher styrene formation3-5.
The large amount of wasted energy in the form of excess steam6,
the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and the deactivation
of catalyst5 are among the several problems which must be
solved7. In order to circumvent some of these cited difficulties,
the process of dehydrogenation of EB using CO2 instead of
steam has received much attention8-12. This process, if developed
is believed to be an energy-saving and environmentally friendly
process. In fact, the oxidative dehydrogenation of EB with
CO2 as a soft oxidant13 possesses several advantages10,14-17 than
O2 (strong oxidant) which leads the production of undesired
by-products (oxygenates) along with styrene18. It is well known
that in the present commercial iron catalyst, hematite (α-Fe2O3)
is preferred for styrene production. Small amounts of other
metal oxides like Cr2O3 are added as promoters19. However,

Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide was investigated over a series of binary iron-chromium
oxides (Fe2O3-Cr2O3) supported on alumina, silica and titania. The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, IR and SEM. XRD and
FT-IR characterization indicated that iron and chromium ions are dispersed into the support matrix. Compared to Fe-Cr-Si-30 and Fe-Cr-
Ti-30 catalysts, Fe-Cr-Al-30 was found to be the most active (conversion = 57.2 %) and the most selective in styrene (94.1 %). The
activity value was observed in the following order Fe-Cr-Al > Fe-Cr-Ti.> Fe-Cr-Si. SEM images indicated that there are no significant
carbonaceous deposits on the spent Fe-Cr-Al-30 catalyst, whereas modifications of its morphological aspect were observed. The variation
of Fe-Cr content in the Fe-Cr-Al catalysts showed that the activity depends strongly on the content. The optimal content determined was
50 wt- %.

this commercial iron based catalyst does not work effectively
for the ethylbenzene in the presence of CO2. Consequently
various supports such as Al2O3, MgO, WO3, SiO2, ZrO2 and
activated carbon have been tested on the dehydrogenation of
EB in the presence of CO2
20-30. It has been found that Fe or Cr
oxides supported on activated carbon and Fe oxide supported
on ZrO2 exhibited high initial catalytic activity, but suffered
from severe deactivation22,23,28,31. Saito et al. 32 found that EB
was activated by the acidic sites over γ-Al2O3 supported
catalysts while CO2 was activated by basic sites; CO2 conversion
was then correlated with the amounts of strong basic sites.
The acid-basic and redox properties of the catalyst, at an
optimum composition, will influence the conversion and
selectivity to styrene24,29. Strong basic sites lead to the toluene
formation, whereas acidic ones lead to the benzene formation33.
In this work, the performance of the binary oxides Fe-Cr cata-
lyst system for the dehydrogenation of EB with CO2 has been
investigated. The effect of the support and Fe-Cr loading on
the support was explored.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalysts preparation: The supported catalysts were
prepared by the wet impregnation method. Typically, the
support (alumina, silica and titania) was impregnated with
aqueous mixture solution of 1 M Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and 1 M
Fe(NO3)3·6H2O. The volumes of the mixture solution were

selected to obtain Fe/Cr = 10/90 (molar ratio) in the final binary
oxides. Three catalysts, α-Fe2O3-Cr2O3-Al2O3, α-Fe2O3-Cr2O3-
SiO2 and α-Fe2O3-Cr2O3-TiO2, referred to as Fe-Cr-Al-30,
Fe-Cr-Si-30 and Fe-Cr-Ti-30 constituted of 30 % by weight
of the binary oxides Fe-Cr in the catalyst were prepared by
stirring the support and impregnation solutions maintained at
50 ºC until dryness evaporation and then dried overnight at
120 ºC. The precursor salt was calcined at 750 ºC in stainless
steel reactor with air flow of 6 L/h. The sample was heated
first to 120 ºC for 0.5 h then the temperature was increased to
750 ºC for 3.5 h.
Catalysts characterization: Powder X-ray diffraction
patterns were obtained on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer
with CuKα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation. Fourier transform-infra-
red spectra of the samples were recorded with Shimadzu FTIR
Spetrometer 8400S at ambient conditions via grinding the
sample with KBr and then pressed. Scanning electron micro-
scopy and elemental analysis (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis:
EDAX) were carried out using Jeol SEM model JSM 6360A
(Japan).
Catalyst testing: The dehydrogenation of EB in the
presence of CO2 was carried out in flow fixed bed reactor
loaded with a sample of catalyst under atmospheric pressure.
Prior to dehydrogenation of EB, a sample of a mixed oxides
catalyst was pretreated at 700 ºC for 1 h with 50 mL min-1 CO2
gas. Then, the reactant mixture CO2 and EB at a flow rate of
50 mL min-1 was passed through the catalyst at 660 ºC. The
molar ratio of CO2 to EB was fixed at 11.7 and the W/F was
controlled at 13.9 gcat h/mol. The flow of CO2 gas was cont-
rolled by mass flow controller. Ethylbenzene was fed to the
reaction system with syringe pump. The reaction products were
analyzed with a gas phase chromatograph (Agilent 6890N)
equipped with a flame ionization detector, a thermal conduc-
tivity detector and a capillary column (HP-PLOT Q length
30 m ID 0.53 mm).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
X-Ray powder diffraction: The XRD patterns of samples
with different compositions calcined at 750 ºC are shown in
Fig. 1. Phase identification was performed by comparing the
experimental XRD pattern results (Fig. 1) with the reported
XRD data in ICDD (International Centre for Diffraction Data)
and JCPDS (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards).
The mixed oxides, Cr-Fe-10, showed the typical XRD pattern
of Cr2O3 and α-Fe2O3 with hematite structure (JCPDS files No.
33-664 and 38-1479, respectively). The peaks are relatively
sharp and strong indicating crystalline product with relatively
large crystallites. Nevertheless, other phases could be present
as traces. In fact, it has been reported for several oxides, the

coexistence of various phases besides the main phase26,27. The
XRD results indicated that the mixed oxides have slightly diffe-
rent values than the unsupported binary oxides depending on
the support. Table-1 presents the d-spacings that correspond
to the most significant peaks in the patterns of the unsupported
and the supported binary oxides. The deviation from the
corresponding unsupported binary oxides, α-Fe2O3 and Cr2O3,
respectively may suggest that some iron and chromium ions
are dispersed into the support matrix.
FTIR analysis: The mixed oxides were characterized by
FT-IR spectroscopy. The IR spectra of the samples in the range
from 4000-400 cm-1 are shown in Fig. 2. The IR band at 3464
cm-1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of adsorbed H2O
molecules. The IR band at 1626 band is normally attributed to
O-H bending vibrations34. Compared with the unsupported
α-Fe2O3/Cr2O3 mixed oxides, the supported ones showed
almost the same features in their FT-IR spectra that can be
attributed to changes in the metal-oxygen bonding. The peaks
are characteristic of IR-active fundamental and combination
lattice modes of crystalline Cr and Fe oxides35. The bands in
800-400 cm-1 region could be assigned to Fe-O or Cr-O lattice
vibration36-41. The band at 947 cm-1 is assigned to Cr-O-Cr
vibrations. The bands at 897 cm-1 is assigned to Cr-O-Cr
vibrations and Fe-O-Fe22,35. The deviation from the unsupported

Change in the activity of catalyst with time on stream:
The dehydrogenation of EB was performed in the presence
of CO2 as a mild oxidant over the supported Fe-Cr oxide
catalysts. The overall EB conversion and the selectivity of
the products for the different catalysts were studied. Fig. 3
showed that the time-on-stream experiments revealed that the
EB conversion over Fe-Cr -Al decreased rapidly from 76.8 to
58.5 % after 7 h, whereas no evident decrease in the conversion
is observed over Fe-Cr -Si and Fe-Cr -Ti catalysts after 4 h.
The acidity of catalysts had significant impact on the catalytic
performance. Strong acidity could promote the cracking of
EB and make the styrene selectivity decrease. The deactivation
of Fe-Cr-Al might not be due only to the coke formation, but
also to the sintering of the catalyst. In fact, the evolution of
the yield with time on stream for all these catalysts showed
that they form the cracking products with almost the same
yield (Fig. 4). The yield obtained over Fe-Cr-Al, Fe-Cr-Si and
Fe-Cr-Ti are 3.7, 2.9 and 3.6 %, respectively. This result indi-
cated that all the catalyst underwent the same effect of carbon
deposition. Thus, the deactivation of Fe-Cr-Al might be due
also to the sintering of the catalyst. This result was evidenced
by SEM measurements. The morphological aspects of fresh
and spent catalysts were evidenced by SEM images. As shown
in Fig. 5a, fresh Fe-Cr -Al sample is characterized by irregular
prismatic crystals. By contrast, spent Fe-Cr-Al catalyst is
composed of large polygonal aggregates, particles (Fig. 5b).
No significant carbon deposits are identified; only the solid
structure was modified. Thus, CO2 contributed in the carbon
removal. In fact, Mamedov and Corberan42 have reported that
CO2 has two main roles: first is to remove the hydrogen
produced as water by the reverse water gas shift reaction; there-
fore, the equilibrium limitation of dehydrogenation shifts to
the products side and the second is to remove the deposited
coke.
The evolution of the styrene selectivity with time on stream
is shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that styrene is the major
product in this reaction whereas benzene and toluene are minor
by-products. After 7 h on stream, the Fe-Cr/Si and Fe-Cr/Ti

catalysts exhibited almost identical styrene selectivity 90.0 and
90.9 %, respectively. The stability of styrene selectivity with
time on stream while the activity decreased indicated that
the catalyst deactivation was mostly due to sintering but not
to carbon deposition (carbon deposition alters the styrene
formation). Thus, besides its role as a soft oxidant, CO2 played
also the role of coke removal. As shown in Table-2, the Fe-Cr/Al

catalyst is the most active solid (conversion = 57.2 %) and the
most selective in styrene (94.1 %). Its high activity compared
to its counterpart silica and titania supported Fe-Cr oxides is
due to the combined effects of acid-base and redox properties.
The activity values suggest the following order of the
favourable acid-base /redox and catalytic properties under
these reaction conditions: Fe-Cr-Al > Fe-Cr-Ti > Fe-Cr-Si.
Effects of binary oxides loading on the catalytic activity
of Fe-Cr-Al: It is well known that the conversion and selectivity
to styrene is influenced by the acid-basic and redox properties
of the catalyst. An optimum of configuration in acid-basic and
redox properties needs to be tailored base on the binding
energies in EB molecule. If the surface basic sites are strong
enough to abstract b-hydrogen from EB, the break of the lateral
C-C bond is promoted and, therefore, the selectivity to toluene
will increase. If the catalyst surface acidity is larger, α-hydrogen
can be abstracted from EB and the break of the phenyl-C bond
become more probably, therefore, a higher selectivity to benzene
will be obtained33. Since EB dehydrogenation occurs at the
redox sites on the solid surface and CO2 behaves as an oxidant
for Fe and Cr species, it is useful to determine the optimal
composition of the catalyst for dehydrogenation of EB with
CO2. For that purpose a series of Fe-Cr-Al catalysts with diffe-
rent Fe-Cr content (10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 wt %) marked as
Fe-Cr-Al-x (x denotes the weight percent of Fe-Cr in Fe-Cr-
Al) was prepared and tested. Fig. 7 represented the variation
of the overall conversion of EB dehydrogenation as a function
of time on stream over the series of catalysts. It can be seen
that the EB conversion declined gradually with time on stream
for low loadings while it remained stable for higher loadings

(70 and 90 %). It is worth noting that the most stable catalysts
were the less selective in styrene production (Fig. 8), i.e., the
most selective in cracking products. This result suggested that
the main deactivation was not due to the coke formation as it
was the case for many catalyst systems22,43,44.

The activity and the selectivity at the steady state for
dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2 are presented
in the Fig. 9. It can be seen that the catalytic behavour of
Fe-Cr/Al depends strongly on the loading. Ethylbenzene
conversion initially increased from 31.93-95.38 % when
Fe-Cr content increased from 10 to 70 %. Up to 70 % the EB
conversion remained unchanged. As for the selectivities, Fig. 9
showed that the selectivity of styrene and the cracking
products (benzene and toluene) remained unchanged when
the loading varied from 10-50 %. A further increase in the
binary oxides content decreased the styrene selectivity in
favour of that of cracking. Thus, the optimal loading of the
catalyst was determined to be 50 %.

Conclusion
Compared to Fe-Cr-Si and Fe-Cr-Ti, Fe-Cr-Al is the suitable
phase for the dehydrogenation of EB with CO2. The activity
value was observed in the following order : Fe-Cr-Al > Fe-Cr-
Ti > Fe-Cr-Si. The variation of the Fe-Cr content in the Fe-Cr-
Al catalyst systems indicated that the catalytic behavour of
Fe-Cr -Al catalyst was strongly dependent on the Fe-Cr
content. The optimal loading of the catalyst was observed when
Fe-Cr content was equal to 50 wt- %, which could be attributed
to the appropriate acid- base sites distribution. Characterization
of the spent Fe-Cr-Al catalyst indicated that that there are no
significant carbonaceous deposits on the spent Fe-Cr-Al-30
catalyst, whereas modifications of its morphological aspect
were observed. These results suggest that the main deactivation
is not due to the coke formation as it is the case for many
catalyst systems. Besides its role as a soft oxidant, CO2 contri-
buted in the carbon removal.
