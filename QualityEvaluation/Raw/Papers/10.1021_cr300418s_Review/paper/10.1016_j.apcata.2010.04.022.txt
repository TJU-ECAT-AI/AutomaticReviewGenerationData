The Fischer–Tropsch synthesis reaction using a simulated gas mixture, comparable to that obtained from
biomass transformation (biosyngas), was studied over LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskites. The perovskites were
prepared using the amorphous citrate precursor method and the FTS reaction was carried out in a stainless
steel ﬁxed bed reactor at 300 ◦C and 1 MPa. Nitrogen adsorption was at −196 ◦C. Thermal-programmed
reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy (FTIR), oxygen-temperature-
programmed desorption (O2-TPD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used as characterization
methods. The perovskites were found to display two crystal systems determined by XRD patterns,
orthorhombic for xCo < 0.5 and rhombohedral for xCo ≥0.5. The LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskites, with a sub-
stitution degree xCo = 0.1, 0.2 and 1.0, displayed signiﬁcant intrinsic CO conversion. This activity was
probably due to the formation of Co–metal segregates on the surface, as suggested by XRD patterns. The
highest CO intrinsic conversion was obtained for perovskites with a substitution degree of xCo = 0.2. The
LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskites presented a wide distribution of liquid hydrocarbons (C6–C18+) and high CH4
formation. The liquid product distribution was related to the average size of iron particles. The increase
of cobalt particle size favours the formation of hydrocarbons centred in C8–9 chain length.

1. Introduction
Perovskites are a mixed oxide type (ABO3) with a well-deﬁned
structure that allows a partial or total replacement of A3+ and B3+
ions without signiﬁcantly altering the crystal structure. The par-
tial substitution of A by cations of lower valence produces oxygen
vacancies and the unusual oxidation state of the B cation to main-
tain charge neutrality [1]. These vacancies also can be generated by
the replacement of other B cations with cations of similar size but
lower oxidation state. Due to these properties, perovskites have a
wide application and have been extensively studied as catalysts in
several reactions over the last 40 years [1]. In this context, the main
application of perovskites as catalysts has been in the oxidation of
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide [2–4]. The catalytic activity
of several LaBO3 (B = ﬁrst-row transition element) perovskites for
oxidation reactions has been related mainly with reduction and
oxygen adsorption properties [5–7]. Recently, LaBO3 perovskite
oxides have been studied in the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS)
from CO/H2 mixtures with a molar ratio H2/CO equal to 1 [8–10].
Bedel et al. [9] have studied FTS over La(1−y)Co0.4Fe0.6O3−ı per-
ovskite reporting a high C2–C4 oleﬁns selectivity. The activity of the

perovskites in the FTS has been related to the precursor perovskite’s
properties: its stability, crystalline structure and degree of reduc-
tion. The results obtained indicate that perovskites are promising
catalysts for FTS using a biosyngas feed, similar to recent reports
for Co/SiO2 and Fe/SiO2 catalysts [11–13].
Biosyngas is a mixture of CO2, CO, CH4, H2 and N2 obtained by
gasiﬁcation of biomass. The advantages of hydrocarbons produced
from the FTS using a biosyngas feed is that they will be free of S
and N as well as neutral in the CO2 greenhouse effect. Therefore,
these liquid hydrocarbons will be a good alternative to petroleum-
derived fuels and chemicals. Since it is necessary to look for new,
active and selective FTS catalysts, the focus of this work is to study
the FTS over LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskites using biosyngas as feed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the catalysts
LaFe1−xCoxO3 (xCo = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0) perovskites
were prepared via the amorphous citrate precursor method. Sto-
ichiometric amounts of aqueous solution of the nitrates of the
corresponding metals were mixed with a 10% of excess in equiv-
alent of an aqueous solution of citric acid. The resulting mixture
was stirred for 15 min at room temperature and evaporated at
70 ◦C until gel formation was reached. Then, the gel was dried in

an oven, by slowly increasing the oven temperature up to 250 ◦C
and maintaining it overnight. The resulting powders, amorphous
citrate precursor and basic precipitate were crushed and sieved to
obtain the required particle size (<200 m). Finally, the solids were
calcined at 700 ◦C in air for 6 h.
2.2. Characterization
Absorption atomic spectroscopy (AAS) was performed using a
Perkin Elmer instrument model 3100 to determine the lanthanum,
cobalt and iron composition of the bulk. The speciﬁc surface areas
were obtained from nitrogen adsorption isotherms at −196 ◦C in
an automatic micromeritics apparatus model ASAP 2010, and were
evaluated using the BET equation. SEM micrographs were obtained
in a JEOL model JSM 6380 LV. X-ray diffraction patterns were
obtained on a Rigaku diffractometer using a Ni-ﬁlter and CuK1
radiation. The crystalline phases were identiﬁed by reference to the
powder diffraction data (JCPDS-ICDD). TPR and oxygen TPD exper-
iments were performed in a TPR/TPD 2900 micromeritics system
with a thermal conductivity detector. For the TPR experiments, the
reducing gas was a mixture of 5% H2/Ar (40 cm3 min−1) and a heat-
ing rate of 10 ◦C min−1 was employed. For the TPD experiments, the
samples were exposed to oxygen for 1 h at 700 ◦C, followed by cool-
ing to room temperature in the same atmosphere. After switching
the atmosphere to a helium ﬂow, the sample was heated at a con-
stant rate of 10 ◦C min−1 and the oxygen desorbed was monitored
with a thermal conductivity detector. FTIR spectra were recorded
in a Nicolet Magna-IR 550 instrument equipped with a quartz sam-
ple holder with KBr windows. The perovskites were dehydrated at
210 ◦C and ﬁnely ground in an agate mortar with KBr to obtain a
sample/KBr ratio 1/150.
2.3. Catalytic activity
Activity tests were carried out in a ﬁxed bed stainless steel
reactor. The reaction conditions were: space velocity (GHSV) of
1800 ml g−1 h−1, pressure of 1 MPa and reaction temperature of
300 ◦C. The feed was a representative mixture obtained from
biomass gasiﬁcation with H2/CO/CO2/CH4/N2 in the molar propor-
tion 32%/32%/12%/18%/6%, respectively [14]. Prior to the reaction,
the catalysts were reduced in situ at 400 ◦C during 12 h under
hydrogen ﬂow. Activity data were taken at steady-state conditions,
approximately after 80 h on-stream. The products were analyzed by
gas chromatography using a Perkin Elmer 3920B system provided
with a thermal conductivity detector, using an n-octane Porasil-
C column for liquids and a Carbosieve II column for the gaseous
products.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. AAS
The elemental compositions of the LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskite
oxides were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry
and the results are compiled in Table 1. It can be seen that
the cobalt, iron and lanthanum contents approach the nominal
ones.
3.2. Speciﬁc area
The BET speciﬁc surface areas of the samples, summarized in
Table 1, were around 13 m2 g−1. LaFeO3 perovskite exhibits the
largest BET area (15.3 m2 g−1) and the lowest BET area (7.5 m2 g−1)
for xCo = 0.1. For 0.1 < xCo ≤0.5, the BET surface area increases with
cobalt content and reaches the value for the LaCoO3 reference. The
lower surface area value exhibited for LaFe0.9Co0.1O3 may seem
abnormal, but similar results have been previously reported for
these kinds of structure [15,16].
3.3. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)
Temperature-programmed reduction cycles (TPR1–TPR2) were
performed with the aim to study the prepared perovskites’
reducibility, which is a key parameter related to Co segregation.
The procedure included the following steps: (i) a ﬁrst reduction
step under H2/Ar ﬂow up to 700 ◦C (TPR1); (ii) a cooling in Ar ﬂow
to room temperature; (iii) an oxidation in an O2/He ﬂow mixture
up to 700 ◦C; and (iv) a second reduction treatment (TPR2) as in
step (i) once the sample was cooled to room temperature.
The TPR1 proﬁles are displayed in Fig. 1a and the corresponding
TPR2 proﬁles in Fig. 1b. The largest difference between TPR1 and
TPR2 proﬁles appears for the pure LaFeO3 and LaCoO3 perovskites,
whereas similar TPR proﬁles appear for the substituted perovskites,
indicative of a higher thermal stability after treatment in hydrogen
at 700 ◦C.
As seen in Fig. 1a, despite a broad weak shoulder near 400 ◦C and
a slight increase in H2 consumption at temperatures above 620 ◦C,
the pure LaFeO3 perovskite is essentially irreducible. However, the
TPR1 proﬁle of the substituted LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskites shows a
single peak centred at 400 ◦C, increasing in intensity and shifting
to lower temperatures as the Co fraction increases. LaFe1−xCoxO3
has two reducible cations in the B site, and thus, this reduction
peak could be attributed to Fe and/or Co species. For La1−xCaxFeO3
perovskites, the substitution of La3+ by Ca2+ has been reported to
increase iron’s oxidation state resulting in an additional reduc-
tion peak at 360 ◦C assigned to the reduction pair Fe4+/Fe3+ [17].
In the Co system counterpart, i.e., the La1−xCaxCoO3 perovskites
[18], a broad reduction peak between 350 and 450 ◦C has been
reported and assigned to the formation of an intermediate per-
ovskite. For LaCo1−xFexO3 perovskites [19], the substitution of Fe3+
by Co3+ affects the ﬁrst reduction stage, modifying the split peak of
the LaCoO3 perovskite showing only one reduction peak, probably
avoiding an intermediate reduction state. The subsequent reduc-
tion of Co3+/Co2+ to Co0 occurs at higher temperatures decreasing
in intensity with an increasing Fe amount and disappears when
the level of substitution reaches 50%. Therefore, for the studied
LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskite oxides, in the experimental conditions,

the TPR cannot detect the expected reduction stage to Co0. Mean-
while, in the activity test, under the experimental conditions (1 kPa,
400 ◦C), the reduction to Co0 is highly probable to occur, such as has
been detected by Bedel et al. [8,9].
In Fig. 1a for the pure LaCoO3 perovskite, two well-deﬁned peaks
appear, indicative of two reduction stages, in agreement with pre-
vious results [20–22]. The ﬁrst peak at 350 ◦C corresponds to the
formation of an oxygen-deﬁcient perovskite structure (LaCoO3−ı).
The complete reduction of the perovskite, with formation of La2O3,
La(OH)3, H2O and Co0, corresponds to the second reduction peak
at temperatures above 500 ◦C. In Fig. 1b, the TPR2 proﬁles show
slight differences with respect to the TPR1 proﬁles, indicative of
the reversibility of the redox cycle. For the pure LaFeO3, a small,
broad peak at 410 ◦C, not present in the TPR1 proﬁle, indicates the
presence of a segregated phase. Since this perovskite is a Co-free
sample and La is not reducible under the experimental conditions,
this reducibility must be associated with Fe3+ segregates during
the TPR1 proﬁle. Therefore, the slight increase in H2 consumption at
temperatures above 620 ◦C during TPR1 produced metallic iron that
was expelled from the perovskite structure during TPR1. The metal-
lic iron is re-oxidized into iron oxide during oxidation resulting in
a non-stoichiometric perovskite plus a fraction of segregated iron
oxide. The TPR2 proﬁles for pure LaFeO3 perovskite show only one
reduction peak that corresponds to segregated iron oxide at 410 ◦C.
For the substituted LaFe1−xCoxO3, the TPR2 cycles do not show sig-
niﬁcant differences with TPR1 proﬁles indicating that almost no
changes took place in the perovskite structure after hydrogen treat-
ment. The tendency of the Co effect on the perovskites’ reducibility
can be observed from the continuous decreases of the maximum
temperature of this reduction peak from xCo = 0.1 to a rather con-
stant value for xCo = 0.4 and 0.5. For the pure LaCoO3, the shoulder
of the two larger reduction stages indicates that there could be at
least four reduction stages as reported in the literature [23]. The
ﬁrst stage is the formation of the oxide of the B cation and a spinel
structure, followed by the B cation reduction, and ﬁnally, La2O3 and
Co0 formation. A partial reduction of Co3+ to a mixture Co3+/Co2+
occurs only for this perovskite during the TPR1 proﬁle, and thus the
shoulder in the peak of the TPR2 proﬁle is due to the reduction of
the segregated Co3O4 crystallites.
The quantiﬁcation of the ﬁrst reduction peak, at temperatures
lower than 500 ◦C, can be taken as a measurement of the extent of
Co insertion in the perovskite structure [10], i.e., the formation of a
non-stoichiometric perovskite. Table 2 compiles the amounts of H2
consumed. An almost linear increase with xCo is obtained. Taking
into account that the redox cycle of Co3+/Co2+ is easier to achieve
than the corresponding iron redox cycle, this increase can be related
to the progressive insertion of Co into the perovskite structure.

LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskites were performed with the objective to
reveal structural transformations and crystalline phases developed
after reduction and oxidization. Fig. 2 shows for the as-prepared
samples sharp reﬂections located at the expected 2 values, con-
ﬁrming that the perovskite structure was obtained after calcination
of the solids at 600 ◦C. For comparison purposes, the bar patterns
of orthorhombic LaFeO3 (JCPDS-ICDD, 37-1493) and rhombohe-
dral LaCoO3 (JCPDS-ICDD, 48-0123) phases are also included. It
can be seen that the pure LaFeO3 and LaCoO3 samples belong to
orthorhombic and rhombohedral phases, respectively, in absence
of any other crystalline phases, in agreement with the results
reported in the literature [24,25]. Changes depending on the cobalt
substitution can also be observed. A careful inspection of these
diffraction proﬁles reveals some features: (i) a slight shift towards
larger 2 angles, due to a lattice contraction, is observed upon sub-
stitution of Fe3+ ions in the lattice by Co3+ ions; and (ii) the full width
at half maximum of diffraction lines increases upon substitution
of Fe3+ by Co3+. These ﬁndings are in accordance with the general
trend that the extent of cobalt substitution is related to these effects
and corresponds to some structure modiﬁcation [26,27]. The peak

shift towards higher 2 angles as the cobalt amount increases indi-
cates a decrease in the interplanar distance, i.e., the unit cell volume
decreases. The ionic radius of Co3+ (HS 0.61 Å) is smaller than that
of Fe3+ (HS 0.78 Å); therefore, the decrease of the unit cell volume is
expected for Co3+ substitution. Fig. 3 shows the shift of the 2 val-
ues, corresponding to the Bragg angles of 32.3◦, 46.2◦and 57.4◦as
a function of the degree of cobalt substitution. The linear shift with
xCo suggests a continuous insertion of cobalt. A detailed view of the
signal corresponding to 2 = 33◦is also shown in Fig. 3. The typical
doublet of the rhombohedral structure appears for pure LaCoO3 and
for the xCo = 0.5 perovskite; the top of the peak became wider. For
xCo ≤0.4, this signal clearly corresponds to a singlet. For the sake
of simplicity, only the xCo = 0.4 signal is included. Therefore, for the
xCo ≤0.4 perovskites, the orthorhombic structure is obtained. The
absence of diffraction lines belonging to single iron or cobalt oxides
can be taken as indicative that after calcinations at 600 ◦C, there
are no segregated phases and the oxide phases are neither highly
dispersed nor in an amorphous form.
The mean crystallite sizes of the perovskites were evaluated
using the Debye Scherrer equation and are shown in Table 1. A
decrease in the perovskite crystal size from 42 to 31 nm as the
substitution degree increases is clearly seen for the xCo ≤0.4 per-
ovskites. The subsequent increases in the crystal size for xCo = 0.5
and 1.0 can be attributed to the change in the crystalline structure
from orthorhombic to rhombohedral.
Since the pre-treatment of the perovskites before catalytic
activity measurement is in hydrogen, the thermal behaviour in a
reduction atmosphere, XRD and nitrogen isotherms were carried

ovskites.
out after a thermal treatment in H2 for 12 h at 400 ◦C. The XRD
patterns and the speciﬁc area are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1,
respectively. The XRD patterns of the samples activated with H2
to 400 ◦C show slight differences in the diffractograms, indicating
a high stability of these LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskite solid solutions.
Fig. 4 shows broader diffraction lines indicative of poorer crys-
tallinity and no new diffraction lines, indicating either the absence
of or a highly dispersed segregated phase. Comparing Figs. 2 and 4,
the most important modiﬁcations are for the xCo = 1.0, the cobaltite,
in which the doublet at 2 = 33◦disappears, indicating a change in
the crystalline structure. This result is in line with the large differ-
ences in the TPR1/TPR2 proﬁles for this perovskite, and indicates
that this perovskite has the lowest stability in H2 of the studied
series. Therefore, segregated phases such as La(OH)3, La2O3 or CoO
compounds must be formed. The band at 2 = 41◦, correspond-
ing to metallic cobalt, is also observed and agrees with Crespin et
al. [22]. For the Co-free perovskite LaFeO3, it can be noted that a
higher thermal resistance under reducing atmosphere is detected.
The diffraction proﬁles for the xCo = 0.5 perovskite activated with
H2 to 400 ◦C are surprising because they almost correspond to the
diffraction proﬁles of the calcined sample. The close up in Fig. 4
of the peak at 2 = 33◦of the xCo = 0.5 sample is slightly broader
than the corresponding one in Fig. 2. Meanwhile, the differences
are larger for the xCo = 0.4, clearly indicating the higher stability of
the xCo = 0.5 in comparison with the xCo = 0.4 perovskite. Therefore,
for the equimolar Fe–Co perovskite, the stability under hydrogen
treatment is the highest of the series. The thermal behaviour of the
xCo = 0.1 and 0.3 perovskites is similar to the behaviour for xCo = 0.0
and 0.4, respectively. The observed behaviour of the xCo = 0.2 per-
ovskite, in which broader diffraction peaks and a larger shift in
the diffraction lines are obtained after the activation with H2 up
to 400 ◦C, indicates a loss in the perovskite structure, suggesting a
segregation of B cation.
3.5. Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy (FTIR)
The vibrational frequencies in the infrared are fundamental in
the determination of crystalline structures [28]. Fig. 5a presents
the IR spectra for all the perovskites in the region between
4000 and 1500 cm−1, and Fig. 5b presents the IR spectra corre-
sponding to the far infrared zone. Four vibrational modes have
been assigned for perovskites and mixed perovskite-type oxides:
1 = asymmetrical stretching of the B–O bond of the structure’s
octahedrons BO6; 2 = symmetrical lengthening of the O–B–O

tion at 400 ◦C for 12 h.

bond; 3 = vibration of the network’s cation A against the octahe-
drons BO6; 4 = deformation of the vibration angle of the O–B–O
bond [29]. Even when 4 is not active for cubic perovskites [16], it
can be active for the perovskites that present structural deforma-
tions. When the two ﬁgures are superimposed, three of the reported
frequencies emerge. In Fig. 5a, the most important band of the per-
ovskite structure, 1 at 604 cm−1, is sharper for the pure LaFeO3
perovskite (xCo = 0.0), indicating a more symmetrical structure, in
agreement with the orthorhombic structure revealed by XRD. Band
widening and/or the appearance of a shoulder indicate a structure
with lower symmetry. In the perovskites with yCo ≥0.4, a shoulder
also appears at 563 cm−1, which is characteristic of the rhombo-
hedral structure. In Fig. 5a for the pure LaFeO3 perovskite oxide,
a band at 2800 cm−1 is assigned to the segregated La2O3 phase.
The spectrum also shows bands at 1565 and 1440 cm−1 assigned,
respectively, to the asymmetric and symmetric O–C–O stretching
vibration modes of carboxylate structures associated with the pres-
ence of segregated phases in the form of carbonates. Since band
intensities are almost constant with the substitution degree (xCo),
this result indicates that the Co3+ ions for xCo ≤0.5 are incorpo-
rated into the orthorhombic LaFeO3 perovskite structure and that
a new rhombohedral structure appears for xCo = 0.5. The wide band
at 3600 cm−1 is associated to the lengthening of water’s O–H bond
due to exposure to air and environmental humidity for the studied
perovskites.
In Fig. 5b, the characteristic frequencies 2, 3 and 4 are
observed with differences in band intensity, position, and appear-
ance, conﬁrming the structural changes previously discussed for
the series of studied perovskites. For the pure LaCoO3 (xCo = 1.0),
the spectra correspond to a rhombohedral structure with great
symmetry [30]. The typical symmetrical doublet for rhombohedral
structures appears with bands at 419 cm−1 corresponding to mode
2 and the band at 334 cm−1 to 4. The band that appears at low
frequency, 176 cm−1, corresponds to the vibration of the bond 3.
With respect to pure LaFeO3, yCo = 0.0, the other extreme of the
series, the spectra correspond to an orthorhombic structure with
great symmetry, in which three vibrational modes reported for this
structure type [31] appear. The wide, intense band at 340 cm−1 cor-
responds to the vibrational mode 2 with the 4 band appearing
at 290 cm−1. At 170 cm−1, the vibrational mode 3 also appears.
A clear displacement of 2 and 4 bands towards higher vibration
frequencies and a more symmetric doublet as xCo increases can be
detected. This result indicates that pure LaFeO3 tolerates Co inser-
tion without larger structural changes up to values of xCo ≤0.3. For
xCo = 0.4 and 0.5, the presence of a mixture of orthorhombic and
rhombohedral structures can be detected. Even though XRD and
FTIR show the same structure results, the extent of rhombohedral
structure present for xCo = 0.4 was not detected by XRD. The broad
band observed at 3200 cm−1 is assigned to La2O3 as La(OH)3.
3.6. Oxygen-temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD)
The evolution of oxygen during temperature-programmed des-
orption experiments is correlated to the redox properties of these
oxides [32]. In Fig. 6, O2-TPD proﬁles are displayed. Depending
on the desorption temperature, physical, - and -oxygen can be
detected. Physical oxygen corresponds to the low desorption peak
centred at ca. 80 ◦C, which likely comes from weakly held oxygen

species [18]. The -oxygen appears as a shoulder at 250 ◦C for the
pure LaFeO3 perovskite and to a lower extent for some of the substi-
tuted ones. Finally, a small, broad desorption peak is also observed
at 400 ◦C, is denoted -oxygen and associated with the lattice
oxygen. Even though signiﬁcant changes in the extent of - and -
oxygen in other substituted perovskites have been reported [4,17],
no signiﬁcant changes in oxygen vacancies can be detected for the
studied system. The observed desorption is expected because there
is no charge compensation due to the substitution of Fe3+ by Co3+.
3.7. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
The SEM micrographs show slight differences in perovskite mor-
phology upon cobalt substitution. EDAX analysis of the samples was
used to quantify the amount of La, Co and Fe elements in the per-
ovskites. Fig. 7a and b shows the bulk and EDAX atomic ratios of
Fe/La and Co/La. Although EDAX is not a surface sensitive technique,
the obtained atomic ratio can provide important information about
the dependence of these ratios on xCo substitution. It can be seen
that the EDAX Co/La ratio is higher than expected considering the
nominal compositions, and the differences are even larger upon
increasing Co substitution. With respect to the EDAX Fe/La atomic
ratios, the difference between nominal and EDAX values decreases
upon xCo substitution. The dependence of EDAX atomic ratios is
almost linear with the studied degree of substitution. The xCo = 0.2
perovskite shows a singularity in the trends, with Fe/La and Co/La
higher that the expected values assuming linear behaviour. This
result indicates that the xCo = 0.2 perovskite becomes Fe- and Co-
enriched. Since perovskite-type oxides are a crystalline structure,
this enrichment must be due to the presence of highly segregated
phases since it was not detected by XRD patterns.
3.8. Catalytic activity
Fig. 8 shows the intrinsic CO conversion, expressed as moles
of CO converted per grams of catalyst and square meter of the
LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskites, as a function of Co content. It can be
seen that only the perovskites with a substitution degree xCo = 0.1,
0.2 and 1.0 display a signiﬁcant intrinsic CO conversion value.
It has been reported for perovskite-type oxides that only the
orthorhombic structure displays catalytic activity [10]. The studied
LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskites display the orthorhombic structure only
for the substitution degree xCo ≤0.4, and therefore the observed
results are not surprising. Moreover, the catalytic activity of the FT
catalysts can also be related to the presence of metallic Co [8–10].
Therefore, the trend obtained in Fig. 8 must also be related with the
presence of Co as a segregated phase in the prepared orthorhombic
perovskites. It has been previously pointed out for the TPR proﬁle
and XRD patterns results that xCo = 0.1 and 0.2 perovskites show a
widening and changing in the intensity of the diffraction lines, sug-
gesting a loss in the crystalline structure, with corresponding phase
segregation. It is highly probable that Co is formed and segregated
on the surface for these two perovskites, agreeing with Bedel et al.
[10]. On the other hand, the xCo = 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 perovskites do not
present signiﬁcant changes in the XRD patterns after the thermal
treatment in H2. This higher thermal stability in reducing atmo-
sphere implies that these perovskites do not segregate Co species.
The higher stability of the xCo = 0.4 and 0.5 perovskites in reducing
atmospheres is due to the presence of a mixture of orthorhombic
and rhombohedral crystalline structures as seen with FTIR. The high
stability in reducing atmospheres of the xCo = 0.3 perovskite is not
yet clear.
It must be pointed out that the catalytic activity of all of the pre-
pared perovskites was carried out using a mixture called biosyngas,
as a feed. Biosyngas, a mixture with a molar ratio of CO/H2 = 1.0
with other gases (N2, CO2 and CH4), displays lower reactivity in
the CO conversion than the normal mixture used as feed (syngas).
Therefore, to convert the CO molecule in a biosyngas mixture, it
is necessary to use catalysts with higher activity, i.e., highly seg-
regated Co species that are highly dispersed on the surface. The
higher CO conversion of the xCo = 0.2 perovskite can be explained
considering the EDAX results, which show a higher extent of segre-
gated phases on the surface. Regarding the pure LaFeO3 perovskite,

stitution degree.

reaction over LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskites as a function of Co substitution degree.
although this perovskite displays an orthorhombic structure, no
catalytic activity in CO conversion was observed. Considering the
TPR proﬁle results, since LaFeO3 is an almost irreducible per-
ovskite, temperatures higher than 500 ◦C are necessary to segregate
Fe metal. Therefore, under the reaction conditions used, no seg-
regated Fe species occurs. Pure LaCoO3 perovskite displays the
highest reduction degree in reducing atmospheres, and therefore,
it is highly probable that this perovskite segregates the highest
amounts of Co. However, LaCoO3 perovskites show lower activity
than the substituted xCo = 0.2 perovskite. Considering, the similar
SBET values of pure LaCoO3 and xCo = 0.2 perovskites, larger Co mean
metal particles size must be formed in pure LaCoO3 perovskites
decreasing the catalytic activity for lost active sites. These results
are in agreement with fact that the SFT reaction requires a suit-
able particle size (close to 10 nm) [33]. Conﬁrming that xCo = 0.1
and 0.2 perovskites must display smaller size Co segregates than
the LaCoO3 perovskite.
3.9. Selectivity
Table 3 shows the selectivity for CH4, CO2 and C5+ hydrocar-
bons for the LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskites as a function of Co content at
300 ◦C. It can be seen that CO2 selectivity decreases as the Co sub-
stitution degree increases, where the xCo = 0.1 perovskite has the
highest CO2 selectivity. Since CO2 can only be formed on metal-
lic Fe particles, a small amount of Fe-segregated species must be
present, favouring the water gas shift (WGS) reaction.
WGS reaction : H2O + CO →CO2 + H2
Additionally, CO2 formation may be possible by: (i) dispropor-
tion reaction of carbon monoxide on the surface of Co crystallites
according to the Boudouard reaction [34,35] and (ii) recombination
of atomic oxygen produced in the course of CO dissociation with
other CO molecules as proposed by Krishnamoorthy et al. [36]. In
this model, CO is adsorbed and dissociated on the carbon surface,

and hydrogen does not play any role, as shown in the following
reactions:
CO →Ca + Oa
Oa + CO →CO2
The selectivity of CH4 on LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskites as a function
of Co content can be associated to surface-segregated Co species
and to the morphology of these segregated cobalt species (metal
particle size). The large formation rate of C5+ hydrocarbons on pure
LaCoO3 perovskite is notable as shown in Table 3.
Fig. 9 shows the distribution of condensable products as a func-
tion of Co content. It can be seen that an increase in Co loading
produces a shift in the distribution of condensable products. The
xCo = 0.1 and 0.2 perovskites show a distribution centred in C10–C13,
however pure LaCoO3 perovskites show a distribution centred in
C8–C9. This change in the yield of hydrocarbon chain length has
been related to the metal particle size. Median et al. [11] show
that the formation of hydrocarbons with C8–C9 chain length is
related to an increase of cobalt particle size. Therefore, the for-
mation of hydrocarbon chain lengths centred in C8–C9 for pure
LaCoO3 perovskite can be explained due to the larger Co segregated
particle size. On the other hand, the lowest Co substituted per-
ovskites, xCo = 0.1 and 0.2 display lower amounts of segregated Co
species that are highly dispersed, i.e., smaller particle size, favour-
ing the formation of hydrocarbon chain lengths centred in C10–C13,
in agreement with Medina et al. [11]. The differences in the hydro-
carbon selectivity on larger Co particles can be attributed to the
differences on the rate of secondary reactions such as oleﬁn read-
sorption, as previously proposed [37].
Thus, the catalytic activity of LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskites in the
FT reaction can be explained in terms of the crystalline structure,
segregated Co content and particle size. It is possible to increase
activity and reaction selectivity using thermal treatment in reduc-
ing atmospheres. Even though the obtained results are not in
agreement with Bedel et al. [8], the differences can be attributed
to the nature of the feed and/or to the reduction conditions used in
the evaluation of the catalytic activity.
4. Conclusions
The obtained results show that LaFe1−xCoxO3 perovskites are
active in the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis using a simulated biosyngas
as a feed. The perovskites display two crystal systems determined
by XRD patterns, orthorhombic for xCo < 0.5 and rhombohedral
for xCo ≥0.5. The xCo = 0.1, 0.2 and 1.0 perovskites display a sig-
niﬁcant intrinsic CO conversion, which is related to the amount
of segregated metallic Co. The xCo = 0.2 perovskite displays the
highest CO intrinsic conversion due to the formation of highly dis-
persed, segregated Co species. The absence of segregated Co species
in the xCo = 0.3 and 0.4 perovskites explains the low activity of
these perovskites. This result is a consequence of the high stabil-
ity in reducing atmospheres due to the presence of a mixture of
orthorhombic and rhombohedral crystalline structures as shown
by FTIR. The decreasing selectivity towards CH4 with increasing xCo
and the increasing selectivity to longer chain length condensable
hydrocarbons with decreasing xCo were attributed to changes in the
average particle size of Co segregates. For the xCo = 0.2 and 0.1 per-
ovskites, their smaller particle size favours the formation of longer
chain hydrocarbons. Pure LaCoO3 perovskite displays the highest
extent of poorly dispersed segregated Co, favouring the formation
of short chain hydrocarbons (C8–C9).
