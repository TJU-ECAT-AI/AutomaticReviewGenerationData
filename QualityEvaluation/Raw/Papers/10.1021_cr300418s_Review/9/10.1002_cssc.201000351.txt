V2O5/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-Al2O3 as an Efficient Catalyst for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethylbenzene with Carbon Dioxide
Graphical Abstract
V2O5 impregnated onto Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-Al2O3 is a highly active and stable catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2. For the first time, highly dispersed vanadium species stabilized with CeO2 and/or CeZrO2 solid solution and deposited carbonaceous materials are revealed to be main factors contributing to its high stability.
Vanadium has been widely used in catalysis because metal-oxide-supported vanadia can catalyze many industrially important reactions, such as oxidation reactions.1, 2 The activity of the supported vanadia is highly dependent on the specific oxide support1–3 as a result of the so-called strong metal oxide–support effect. Although many researchers have attempted to gain insight into the catalytic mechanism, by using theoretic calculations and various characterization techniques, it is not yet fully understood.4 Thus, the design of a high-performance supported vanadia catalyst, especially one with a high degree of stability, is still a challenge.
The oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons (ODH) to alkenes is industrially important for various large-volume synthetic polymers. Because ODH with molecular oxygen as oxidant is a promising solution, many efforts have been reported.5 Based on the concepts of dehydrogenation and selective catalytic oxidation of hydrogen, the commercial SMART process for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene was developed. This process co-feeds oxygen and steam in series-reactor system.5a, 5b To overcome safety problems that result from mixing oxygen and light hydrocarbons, a novel idea to remove the dehydrogenation product of hydrogen by using reducible lattice oxygen was proposed,5c–5h and a high-performance catalyst for the selective combustion of hydrogen in the presence of light hydrocarbons has been developed.5e–5h
Alternatively, ODH using CO2, being a soft oxidant without the problem of deep oxidation, is very attractive because it may open up new directions for oxidation reactions,6 and create a new route for ODH. Thus, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 (CO2-ODEB) has been extensively investigated as an efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign process.6, 7 Although the supported vanadia catalyst shows high activity towards CO2-ODEB,7a–7f which proceeds via the Mars–van Krevelen redox mechanism,1, 2 it still suffers from severe catalyst deactivation.7a–7c
Being an excellent redox material, ceria stabilized with zirconia has found widespread use as catalyst or catalyst support.5f, 8 Moreover, defect-site-enriched ceria (with the nature of the defects determined by the applied preparation method) has been reported to promote ODEB with N2O.9 Thus, the combination of CeZrO2 with vanadia may create a unique ODH catalyst, provided that a very well dispersed oxide can be achieved. In this case, CO2-ODEB may proceed according to the redox cycle illustrated in Scheme 1. The oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ by CO2 and the reduction of V5+ to lower oxidation states (possibly V4+) by ethylbenzene are directly involved in CO2-ODEB. Subsequently, V4+ is oxidized to V5+ with the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ to complete the full cycle.

Proposed redox mechanism for CO2-ODEB over V2O5/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-Al2O3.
Herein, we report a highly active and stable catalyst, V2O5/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-Al2O3, for CO2-ODEB. The Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-Al2O3 is prepared by a modified sol–gel method. We determine that highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx stabilized with CeO2 and/or CeZrO2 solid solution is responsible for the high activity of the catalyst, while both the stabilized vanadium species and the deposited carbonaceous materials are, for the first time, revealed to be main factors for its high stability.
Figure 1 compares the results of CO2-ODEB over various catalysts. In accordance with the characteristics of CO2-ODEB, all of the catalysts gave high steady-state selectivity towards styrene (ST) (i.e., >95 %); however, a different scenario was observed in the case of ethylbenzene (EB) conversion. Most significantly, both high and stable EB conversion was observed over 6 wt % V2O5 loaded onto Ce0.6Zr0.4O2(7.3 wt %)-Al2O3 (CZA). In contrast, over 6 wt % V2O5/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2(7.3 wt %)-SiO2 (CZS) prepared by the same method the initial EB conversion was very low, and deactivation was quick. To quantify the roles of the different metal oxides, the turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated, and the results together with the properties of the catalysts are summarized in Table 1. The TOF of the supported vanadia catalysts was clearly higher than that of the Ce0.6Zr0.4O2, by over one order of magnitude, indicating the high catalytic activity of the supported vanadia towards CO2-ODEB. Moreover, the effect of the catalyst support on the TOF of vanadia was significant. This is confirmed by the fact that the TOF was doubled upon the addition of only 7.3 wt % Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 into 6 wt % V2O5/Al2O3.

[a] BET=Brunauer–Emmett-Teller. [b] The surface density of VOx, defined as the number of vanadium atoms per square nanometer of catalyst, is calculated from the BET surface area and the V2O5 loading. [c] The TOF, number of EB molecules converted per metal (vanadium or cerium and zirconium) atom per hour, is calculated based on the EB conversion rate. In cases for vanadium loaded catalysts, the TOF based on vanadium atoms is corrected by subtracting the contribution from Ce0.6Zr0.4O2. [d] Determined from TG-DSC analysis of the used catalyst after TOS of 10 h.
To gain more information on the high performance of the 6 wt % V2O5/CZA, spectroscopic and microscopic techniques were employed to probe the structural and surface properties of the catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman measurements (Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information) led to the conclusion that CZA comprised 2D ceria and/or solid solution of CeZrO2 highly dispersed on γ-Al2O3. In the case of V2O5-loaded samples, no diffractions assigned to any vanadium species were observed by XRD. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, together with diffuse selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Figure 2 a), revealed a very low degree of crystallization for the 6 wt % V2O5/CZA. An increase of the V2O5 loadings on the CZA, from 6 to 15 wt %, gave similar Raman patterns (Figure 2 c), indicative of the presence of similar vanadium species. The very broad Raman shift centered at about 940 cm−1 can be assigned to the interface mode of bridging VOS (where S refers to metal cations from the support, i.e., Al, Ce, and Zr).10 The broad bands at 338 and 480 cm−1 are due to symmetric and asymmetric bending modes of the surface VOx species, respectively. Thus, it can be deduced that 2D monomeric and/or polymeric VOx species together with 2D ceria and/or solid solution of CeZrO2 were anchored onto γ-Al2O3 for the 6 wt % V2O5/CZA. In the case of the CZS (Figure S1), only a broad diffraction line attributed to amorphous silica gel was detected by XRD. After loading 6 wt % V2O5 (Figure 2 d), crystalline V2O5 was formed as indicated by the sharp VO stretching Raman band at 992 cm−1 besides shifts attributable to mono- and/or polymeric VOx species (480 and 1020 cm−1). This is further confirmed by TEM images with different light contrasts (Figure 2 b), in which V2O5 nanoparticles are shown dispersed on the amorphous CZS matrix. XRD (Figure S1) and TEM measurements showed that the crystalline V2O5 was orthorhombic phase (powder diffraction file No. 65-0131).

The redox mechanism given in Scheme 1 is responsible for the high activity of the V2O5/CZA. The proposed mechanism is supported by the oxidation of the reduced CZA with the pulsed CO2 (Figure S3). Furthermore, the stabilization of V5+ with the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ over V2O5/Ce(111) thin film has been revealed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and characterization by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).11 Accordingly, as shown in Scheme 1, the activity for the CO2-ODEB over the V2O5/CZA is enhanced by the stabilization of highly dispersed V5+ by the 2D ceria and/or solid solution of CeZrO2. In contrast, due to the formation of crystalline V2O5, which diminishes the stabilization effect, the 6 wt % V2O5/CZS showed significantly lowered activity towards CO2-ODEB. As shown in Figure 3 a, an increase in the V2O5 loading over CZA, from 6 to 15 wt %, led to a significant decrease of the TOF, from 5.95 to 2.68, but no crystalline V2O5 was formed for any of the V2O5/CZA samples. Three kinds of bonds, that is, VO, VOV, and VOS, are present in the monomeric and polymeric VOx species of supported vanadia. Moreover, below the monolayer surface coverage, it has been proved that the polymerization extent of surface VOx species increases with increasing V2O5 loading.2, 10b, 11 Thus, the number of VO and VOV bonds must be increased when the V2O5 loading onto CZA was increased from 6 to 15 wt %. The increased number of VO and VOV bonds, and the decreased TOF accompanying the increase in V2O5 loadings indicate that these two kinds of bonds play a minor role for the catalytic activity. By contrast, the number of VOS bonds is strongly dependent on the polymerization extent of the surface VOx, and decreases with increasing V2O5 loading. Thus, the VOS bond is probably the active site for the CO2-ODEB. This is in agreement with a result obtained for the oxidation of methanol over supported vanadia, in which the specific catalytic activity originated from a ligand effect of the different support cations, that is, the VOS bond.10b The claim is also supported by the much higher activity of the 6 wt % V2O5/CZA sample compared to the 6 wt % V2O5/Al2O3 sample.

The stabilization of V5+ by highly dispersed ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution is also critical for the high stability of the V2O5/CZA. The high stability of the 6 wt % V2O5/CZA was further confirmed by reaction results obtained over a relatively long-term experiment (Figure 3 b). Indeed, after of 48 h time-on-stream (TOS), the 6 wt % V2O5/CZA still showed a stable EB conversion. According to the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism for ODH reactions,1, 2 the facile recycling between V5+ and V4+ is crucial for ODH reactions. Thus, the redox mechanism in Scheme 1 is facilitated as a result of the highly dispersed V5+ stabilized with the 2D ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution over the 6 wt % V2O5/CZA. This led to the high stability for CO2-ODEB, and is supported by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) results of fresh and used 6 wt % V2O5/CZA (Figure S4). In the case of the fresh catalyst, the peaks for the reduction of ceria and vanadia were well-resolved. In contrast, for the used 6 wt % V2O5/CZA, the peak for the reduction of ceria was either immersed in (after 10 h TOS), or became a shoulder (after 48 h TOS) of the peak for the reduction of vanadium species. Moreover, the reduction temperature at peak maxima was slightly decreased with the increase in TOS. When the CZA was prepared by a precipitation–deposition method (CZA-dp), a well-crystallized ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution was formed (Figure S1), leading to a quick deactivation of the 6 wt % V2O5/CZA-dp within 10 h TOS (Figure S5). Additionally, a more pronounced decrease in the EB conversion with the increasing TOS was observed for V2O5/CZA with a higher loading of vanadia (Figure 3 b). These results indirectly support our claim that the stabilization of V5+ by ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution is critical to the stability of the V2O5/CZA.
Although the stabilization of V5+ by ceria is very important for the high stability of V2O5/CZA, there must be additional factors, considering the stable performance of the V2O5/Al2O3. In recent years, different forms of carbon have been revealed to be active catalysts for the ODH reactions.12 Commonly, coke deposition occurs during CO2-ODEB. Thus, we speculate that the carbonaceous nature of the deposited coke may be involved in the CO2-ODEB. To reveal the effect of the coke deposition on the stability of the catalyst, the coke contents of the catalysts after 10 h TOS were determined by thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry (TG–DSC) analysis, and a typical TG–DSC profile is shown in Figure S6. The relative deactivation rate (R), defined as 100×(X1−X10)/X1, where X is the EB conversion and the subscript indicates the TOS, was calculated. R dramatically decreased with the increase in the coke content of the catalyst (Figure 4). This strongly suggests that coke deposited on the catalyst improves the stability of the catalyst towards CO2-ODEB.

In summary, 6 wt % V2O5/CZA shows a high activity and stability towards CO2-ODEB. The highly dispersed V5+ stabilized by 2D ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution, and the promotional effect of deposited carbonaceous materials are responsible for its high performance. The reaction probably occurs via a redox mechanism, involving oxidation–reduction recycling of Ce3+/Ce4+ and V5+/V4+ in a highly dispersed state, as shown in Scheme 1. This work provides a new route for designing widely used supported vanadia catalysts, and V2O5/CZA is expected to be a promising catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of other alkanes.
Experimental Section
γ-Al2O3, Ce0.6Zr0.4O2, CZA, and CZS were prepared by the same sol–gel procedure, using aluminum isopropoxide, cerium nitrate, zirconium nitrate, and tetraethyl orthosilicate as precursors for Al, Ce, Zr, and Si, respectively. A typical sol–gel procedure, using the preparation of CZA as an example, was as follows: A solution A (1.5 mol L−1) was prepared by dissolving the desired amount of aluminum isopropoxide into a toluene/ethanol mixed solvent (molar ratio 5:6). A solution B was prepared by dissolving cerium nitrate and zirconium nitrate into absolute ethanol (0.1 mol L−1, Ce/Zr=6:4). At room temperature, the desired volumes of solutions A and B were thoroughly mixed, and vigorously stirred for 1 h. The mixture was then refluxed at 90 °C for 3 h. After the solvent was evaporated at 80 °C over a water bath, CZA was obtained by drying and calcining the solid at 80 °C for 12 h and 550 °C for 4 h, respectively. The supported vanadia catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness method, via dipping fine powders of the supports into an aqueous solution of NH4VO3 along with oxalic acid. After drying at 100 °C for 5 h, the catalysts were calcined at 550 °C for 4 h.
The surface areas of the materials were determined by the BET method on an automatic Micrometrics ASAP 2020M instrument. Before measurement, the samples were degassed at 300 °C for 4 h, and N2 adsorption/desorption was performed at −196 °C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (D/Max 2550VB+/PC) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5406 Å) and a Ni filter. The applied voltage and current was 30 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The samples were scanned from 2θ of 20° to 80° with a step size of 0.02° and a counting time of 2.5 s per step. Diffuse reflectance UV/Vis spectra were recorded under ambient conditions on a JASCO V-550 UV/Vis spectrophotometer at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The laser line at 325 nm of a He–Cd laser was used as an excitation source at an output of 50 mW. TEM images were obtained on a Tecnai G2 F20 u-TWIN microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.
Catalytic performance was tested in a fixed-bed reactor (6 mm, i.d.) under atmospheric pressure. Typically, 0.5 g of catalyst (40–60 mesh) diluted with the same amount of quartz sand was loaded into the reactor. Prior to reaction, the catalyst was pretreated at the reaction temperature for 0.5 h under a flow of CO2. Analytical-grade ethylbenzene was introduced into the reactor with a HPLC pump. The condensed and gaseous products were analyzed on a gas chromatography instrument equipped with FID and TCD detectors.

Furthermore, the stabilization of V5+ with the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ over V2O5/Ce(111) thin film has been revealed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and characterization by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).11 Accordingly, as shown in Scheme 1, the activity for the CO2-ODEB over the V2O5/CZA is enhanced by the stabilization of highly dispersed V5+ by the 2D ceria and/or solid solution of CeZrO2. In contrast, due to the formation of crystalline V2O5, which diminishes the stabilization effect, the 6 wt % V2O5/CZS showed significantly lowered activity towards CO2-ODEB. As shown in Figure 3 a, an increase in the V2O5 loading over CZA, from 6 to 15 wt %, led to a significant decrease of the TOF, from 5.95 to 2.68, but no crystalline V2O5 was formed for any of the V2O5/CZA samples. Three kinds of bonds, that is, VO, VOV, and VOS, are present in the monomeric and polymeric VOx species of supported vanadia. Moreover, below the monolayer surface coverage, it has been proved that the polymerization extent of surface VOx species increases with increasing V2O5 loading.2, 10b, 11 Thus, the number of VO and VOV bonds must be increased when the V2O5 loading onto CZA was increased from 6 to 15 wt %. The increased number of VO and VOV bonds, and the decreased TOF accompanying the increase in V2O5 loadings indicate that these two kinds of bonds play a minor role for the catalytic activity. By contrast, the number of VOS bonds is strongly dependent on the polymerization extent of the surface VOx, and decreases with increasing V2O5 loading. Thus, the VOS bond is probably the active site for the CO2-ODEB. This is in agreement with a result obtained for the oxidation of methanol over supported vanadia, in which the specific catalytic activity originated from a ligand effect of the different support cations, that is, the VOS bond.10b The claim is also supported by the much higher activity of the 6 wt % V2O5/CZA sample compared to the 6 wt % V2O5/Al2O3 sample.

The stabilization of V5+ by highly dispersed ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution is also critical for the high stability of the V2O5/CZA. The high stability of the 6 wt % V2O5/CZA was further confirmed by reaction results obtained over a relatively long-term experiment (Figure 3 b). Indeed, after of 48 h time-on-stream (TOS), the 6 wt % V2O5/CZA still showed a stable EB conversion. According to the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism for ODH reactions,1, 2 the facile recycling between V5+ and V4+ is crucial for ODH reactions. Thus, the redox mechanism in Scheme 1 is facilitated as a result of the highly dispersed V5+ stabilized with the 2D ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution over the 6 wt % V2O5/CZA. This led to the high stability for CO2-ODEB, and is supported by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) results of fresh and used 6 wt % V2O5/CZA (Figure S4). In the case of the fresh catalyst, the peaks for the reduction of ceria and vanadia were well-resolved. In contrast, for the used 6 wt % V2O5/CZA, the peak for the reduction of ceria was either immersed in (after 10 h TOS), or became a shoulder (after 48 h TOS) of the peak for the reduction of vanadium species. Moreover, the reduction temperature at peak maxima was slightly decreased with the increase in TOS. When the CZA was prepared by a precipitation–deposition method (CZA-dp), a well-crystallized ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution was formed (Figure S1), leading to a quick deactivation of the 6 wt % V2O5/CZA-dp within 10 h TOS (Figure S5). Additionally, a more pronounced decrease in the EB conversion with the increasing TOS was observed for V2O5/CZA with a higher loading of vanadia (Figure 3 b). These results indirectly support our claim that the stabilization of V5+ by ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution is critical to the stability of the V2O5/CZA.
Although the stabilization of V5+ by ceria is very important for the high stability of V2O5/CZA, there must be additional factors, considering the stable performance of the V2O5/Al2O3. In recent years, different forms of carbon have been revealed to be active catalysts for the ODH reactions.12 Commonly, coke deposition occurs during CO2-ODEB. Thus, we speculate that the carbonaceous nature of the deposited coke may be involved in the CO2-ODEB. To reveal the effect of the coke deposition on the stability of the catalyst, the coke contents of the catalysts after 10 h TOS were determined by thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry (TG–DSC) analysis, and a typical TG–DSC profile is shown in Figure S6. The relative deactivation rate (R), defined as 100×(X1−X10)/X1, where X is the EB conversion and the subscript indicates the TOS, was calculated. R dramatically decreased with the increase in the coke content of the catalyst (Figure 4). This strongly suggests that coke deposited on the catalyst improves the stability of the catalyst towards CO2-ODEB.

In summary, 6 wt % V2O5/CZA shows a high activity and stability towards CO2-ODEB. The highly dispersed V5+ stabilized by 2D ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution, and the promotional effect of deposited carbonaceous materials are responsible for its high performance. The reaction probably occurs via a redox mechanism, involving oxidation–reduction recycling of Ce3+/Ce4+ and V5+/V4+ in a highly dispersed state, as shown in Scheme 1. This work provides a new route for designing widely used supported vanadia catalysts, and V2O5/CZA is expected to be a promising catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of other alkanes.
Experimental Section
γ-Al2O3, Ce0.6Zr0.4O2, CZA, and CZS were prepared by the same sol–gel procedure, using aluminum isopropoxide, cerium nitrate, zirconium nitrate, and tetraethyl orthosilicate as precursors for Al, Ce, Zr, and Si, respectively. A typical sol–gel procedure, using the preparation of CZA as an example, was as follows: A solution A (1.5 mol L−1) was prepared by dissolving the desired amount of aluminum isopropoxide into a toluene/ethanol mixed solvent (molar ratio 5:6). A solution B was prepared by dissolving cerium nitrate and zirconium nitrate into absolute ethanol (0.1 mol L−1, Ce/Zr=6:4). At room temperature, the desired volumes of solutions A and B were thoroughly mixed, and vigorously stirred for 1 h. The mixture was then refluxed at 90 °C for 3 h. After the solvent was evaporated at 80 °C over a water bath, CZA was obtained by drying and calcining the solid at 80 °C for 12 h and 550 °C for 4 h, respectively. The supported vanadia catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness method, via dipping fine powders of the supports into an aqueous solution of NH4VO3 along with oxalic acid. After drying at 100 °C for 5 h, the catalysts were calcined at 550 °C for 4 h.
The surface areas of the materials were determined by the BET method on an automatic Micrometrics ASAP 2020M instrument. Before measurement, the samples were degassed at 300 °C for 4 h, and N2 adsorption/desorption was performed at −196 °C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (D/Max 2550VB+/PC) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5406 Å) and a Ni filter. The applied voltage and current was 30 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The samples were scanned from 2θ of 20° to 80° with a step size of 0.02° and a counting time of 2.5 s per step. Diffuse reflectance UV/Vis spectra were recorded under ambient conditions on a JASCO V-550 UV/Vis spectrophotometer at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The laser line at 325 nm of a He–Cd laser was used as an excitation source at an output of 50 mW. TEM images were obtained on a Tecnai G2 F20 u-TWIN microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.
Catalytic performance was tested in a fixed-bed reactor (6 mm, i.d.) under atmospheric pressure. Typically, 0.5 g of catalyst (40–60 mesh) diluted with the same amount of quartz sand was loaded into the reactor. Prior to reaction, the catalyst was pretreated at the reaction temperature for 0.5 h under a flow of CO2. Analytical-grade ethylbenzene was introduced into the reactor with a HPLC pump. The condensed and gaseous products were analyzed on a gas chromatography instrument equipped with FID and TCD detectors.
