 but  improves

 This  is  attributed
 to  hydrogen

 from

 A  two-step

 for  the  EB  dehydrogenation

 show  that  the  redox  mechanism

 of  the  bare  alumina

 attributed
 to

 Introduction
The
 dehydrogenation
 of
 ethylbenzene
 to
 styrene
 with
 CO2 is
 an
alternative
 process
 option
 for
 the
 styrene
 production.
 It
 has
 several
advantages
 over
 the
 normal
 production
 route
 via
 the
 steam-aided
dehydrogenation.
 This
 new
 process
 has
 an
 improved
 conversion,
higher
 selectivity,
 is
 safer,
 and
 is
 less
 energy
 consuming
 [1–6].
The
 steam-aided
 dehydrogenation
 process
 is
 responsible
 for
about
 85%
 of
 the
 worldwide
 production
 of
 styrene.
 This
 process
uses
 a
 potassium
 promoted
 iron
 oxide
 catalyst
 and
 requires
 a
 high
molar
 ratio
 of
 steam
 to
 ethylbenzene
 of
 7–10.
 Steam
 is
 an
 essential
part
 of
 the
 process.
 Several
 functions
 have
 been
 attributed
 to
 H2O
in
 the
 process
 [7,8]:
• provides
 the
 energy
 for
 the
 endothermic
 dehydrogenation
 reac-
tion
 (125
 kJ/mol
 at
 600 ◦C);
• acts
 as
 a
 diluent,
 improving
 the
 equilibrium
 conversion
 of
 the
reaction;
• brings
 the
 catalyst
 to
 the
 right
 active
 oxidation
 state;
• cleans
 the
 catalyst
 from
 coke
 deposits
 by
 coke
 gasiﬁcation;

 (M.

• provides
 easy
 separation
 of
 diluent
 and
 product
 stream.
Carbon
 dioxide
 is
 believed
 to
 act
 in
 a
 similar
 way,
 with
 some
additional
 advantages.
 Its
 heat
 capacity
 is
 higher,
 requiring
 less
diluent
 from
 an
 energetic
 point
 of
 view.
 Under
 the
 dehydrogena-
tion
 conditions,
 CO2 is
 considered
 to
 be
 a
 mild
 oxidant
 like
 steam
and
 is
 able
 to
 re-oxidize
 the
 catalyst.
 It
 is
 claimed
 that
 coke
 can
 be
removed
 by
 the
 reverse
 Boudouard
 reaction.
 Carbon
 dioxide
 is
 a
permanent
 gas,
 making
 the
 separation
 of
 the
 product
 stream
 eas-
ier.
 And
 most
 importantly,
 CO2 can
 react
 with
 the
 formed
 H2 via
the
 reverse
 water–gas-shift
 (RWGS)
 reaction
 and,
 thereby,
 shifting
the
 equilibrium
 conversion
 to
 higher
 values
 [1–6].
The
 RWGS
 reaction
 is
 a
 mildly
 endothermic
 reaction
 (36
 kJ/mol
at
 600 ◦C)
 and
 makes
 the
 process
 more
 endothermic,
 but
 the
increased
 conversion
 per
 pass
 easily
 makes
 up
 for
 those
 additional
costs
 [2].  The
 RWGS
 reaction
 and
 its
 counterpart,
 the
 water–gas-
shift
 (WGS)
 reaction,
 are
 well
 known
 and
 widely
 practiced.
 The
WGS
 reaction
 is
 used
 in
 hydrogen
 production
 e.g.
 for
 the
 ammo-
nia
 production,
 the
 methanol
 synthesis,
 and
 the
 Fischer-Tropsch
synthesis.
 For
 the
 WGS
 reaction
 there
 is
 a
 high
 temperature
 and
 a
low
 temperature
 process
 with
 different
 catalysts.
 The
 low
 tempera-
ture
 WGS
 process
 (210–240 ◦C)
 is
 most
 favorable
 for
 H2 production,
a
 copper
 based
 catalyst
 (Cu/ZnO/Al2O3)
 is
 used
 here
 [9]. A
 low
temperature
 does
 not
 always
 match
 with
 the
 desired
 process
 con-
ditions,
 and
 as
 copper
 is
 not
 stable

 [10].
 The
 high
 temperature
 (300–500 ◦C)
 WGS
process
 uses
 an
 iron
 oxide
 based
 catalyst
 (Fe2O3/Cr2O3),
 but
 the
conversions
 are
 lower
 because
 of
 the
 equilibrium
 limitations
 [9].
The
 mechanism
 of
 (R)WGS
 can
 be
 either
 an
 associative
 or
 redox
type
 [9].  In
 the
 associative
 mechanism,
 the
 reactants
 adsorb,
 form
an
 intermediate,
 break
 into
 the
 products,
 and
 desorb
 [11,12].
 The
redox
 mechanism
 consists
 of
 adsorption,
 reduction
 of
 the
 catalyst
by
 H2 or
 CO,
 and
 oxidation
 of
 the
 catalyst
 by
 CO2 or
 H2O,
 and
desorption
 [12–16].  In
 the
 associative
 mechanism,
 CO
 can
 only
 be
formed
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 hydrogen.
 With
 the
 redox
 mechanism,
the
 CO
 production
 or
 H2O
 production
 should
 be
 observed
 without
the
 presence
 of
 the
 other
 reactant.
The
 dehydrogenation
 process
 in
 CO2 can
 be
 considered
 as
two
 consecutive
 reactions:
 a
 dehydrogenation
 (1)
 followed
 by
 the
RWGS
 (2);
 or
 as
 a
 direct
 dehydrogenation
 by
 CO2 (3)
 [2,6,17].
 These
two
 variations
 are
 comparable
 to
 the
 associative
 and
 redox
 mecha-
nism
 in
 (R)WGS.
 Carbon
 dioxide
 will
 oxidize
 the
 catalyst,
 or
 form
 a
reactive
 intermediate.
 Ethylbenzene,
 or
 hydrogen
 for
 that
 matter,
will
 reduce
 the
 catalyst,
 or
 it
 reacts
 with
 the
 intermediate
 species
on
 the
 catalyst.
 Both
 pathways
 are
 discussed
 in
 literature
 and
 both
seem
 to
 be
 possible.
 The
 two-step
 pathway,
 where
 both
 hydrogen
and
 CO
 are
 produced
 is
 most
 favorable
 from
 a
 thermodynamic
 point
of
 view
 and
 will
 give
 the
 highest
 theoretical
 styrene
 yield.

The
 role
 of
 the
 RWGS
 reaction
 has
 already
 been
 subject
 of
 previ-
ous
 research
 [2,6,17].
 However,
 the
 RWGS
 experiments
 were
 often
done
 under
 different
 reaction
 conditions,

son

compared
 the
 CO2 conversions
 of
 the
 different
 catalysts
 in
 the
presence
 and
 absence
 of
 dehydrogenation
 (Fig.
 1).
 Catalysts,
 con-
taining
 iron
 or
 chromium,
 were
 quite
 active
 for
 the
 RWGS
 alone,
but
 the
 vanadium
 containing
 catalysts
 performed
 much
 better
 in
combination
 with
 the
 dehydrogenation
 reaction.
 Vanadium
 cata-
lysts
 in
 the
 dehydrogenation
 yield
 higher
 CO2 conversions
 than
the
 iron
 or
 chromium
 catalysts.
 This
 was
 explained
 by
 a
 differ-
ence
 in
 mechanism
 for
 vanadium
 and
 other
 catalysts.
 Vanadium
would
 follow
 more
 the
 one-step
 pathway
 with
 the
 involvement
 of
atomic
 hydrogen;
 whereas
 the
 other
 catalysts
 would
 follow
 more
the
 two-step
 pathway
 with
 molecular
 hydrogen
 (Fig.
 2).
 Conditions
in
 those
 experiments
 were
 not
 exactly
 the
 same
 for
 dehydrogena-
tion
 and
 RWGS:
 the
 contact
 time
 was
 doubled
 for
 dehydrogenation
experiments,
 and
 EB
 was
 never
 completely
 converted
 making
 the
amount
 of
 hydrogen
 produced
 deﬁcient
 compared
 to
 the
 RWGS
reaction
 conditions.
 An
 absolute
 comparison
 of
 the
 CO2 conversions
is,
 therefore,
 extremely
 difﬁcult
 [17].
The
 goal
 of
 this
 study
 is
 to
 investigate
 the
 role
 of
 the
 RWGS
 reac-
tion
 in
 the
 dehydrogenation
 in
 CO2.
 This
 systematic
 study
 applies
the
 most
 used
 catalysts
 in
 the
 dehydrogenation:
 iron,
 vanadium,
and
 chromium,
 supported
 on
 alumina;
 un-promoted
 and
 promoted
with
 potassium
 or
 magnesium.
 RWGS
 experiments
 are
 done
 in
 the
presence
 and
 absence
 of
 the
 dehydrogenation
 under
 comparable
conditions
 for
 good
 comparison.
 Based
 on
 our
 recent
 insights
 into
dehydrogenation
 catalysis
 [18],
 also
 coked
 catalysts
 and
 support
are
 included.
 Based
 on
 the
 results,
 the
 reaction
 pathway
 of
 the
dehydrogenation
 in
 CO2 and
 the
 mechanism
 of
 RWGS
 is
 discussed.

 in
 a
 quartz

 with
 an
 inner
 diameter
 of
 8
 mm.
The
 reaction
 temperature
 was
 600 ◦C
 and
 the
 pressure
 at
 the

outlet
 was
 atmospheric.
 In
 a
 typical
 experiment
 400
 mg  of
 catalyst
was
 used.
 On
 top
 of
 the
 catalyst
 bed
 was
 a
 1
 cm
 layer
 of
 SiC
 to
preheat
 the
 feed.
 The
 catalyst
 bed
 and
 SiC
 were
 ﬁxed
 in
 the
 quartz
tube
 by
 quartz
 wool
 plugs.
 Gaseous
 carbon

 was
 fed
 through
a

 controller
 set
 at
 15
 ml

 (NTP
 =
 20 ◦C,

The
 total
 GHSV
 was
 1500

 Before
 starting
 the
experiment
 the
 reactor
 would
 be
 heated
 up
 with
 10 ◦C/min
 and
allowed
 to
 stabilize
 at
 reaction
 temperature
 for
 half
 an
 hour
 under
only
 a
 CO2 ﬂow.
 The
 experiment
 was
 started
 by
 feeding
 hydrogen
to
 the
 reactor.
 The

 kept
 constant,
 the

 where
 the

 could
 be
 switched
 on

 of
 seconds,
were
 performed
 using
 the

and
 under
 the

 was
 connected
 directly
 to
 the

 consisted
 of
 six
 time
intervals.
 Before
 and
 after
 these

 Dehydrogenation
 of
 EB
 in
 CO2
The
 dehydrogenation
 experiments
 were
 performed
 under
 the
same
 temperature
 and
 pressure
 as
 the
 RWGS
 studies.
 The
 test-
ing
 was
 done
 in
 a
 parallel
 ﬁxed
 bed
 setup
 with
 six
 reactors.
 Each
reactor
 had
 an
 independent
 gas
 (CO2 or
 N2)
 feed
 and
 liquid
 feed
(ethylbenzene).
 The
 temperature
 and
 the
 pressure
 of
 all
 reactors
were
 set
 at
 600 ◦C
 and
 atmospheric
 pressure.
 The
 amount
 of
 cat-
alyst
 loaded
 was
 1000
 mg,
 in
 a
 4
 mm
 inner
 diameter
 quartz
 tube
(about
 12
 cm
 bed
 height).
 The
 catalyst
 bed
 was
 held
 between
 lay-
ers
 of
 SiC
 (10
 cm),
 to
 hold
 it
 in
 position
 and
 to
 preheat
 the
 feed.
 The
liquid
 EB
 feed-ﬂow
 rate
 was
 1
 g/h
 (3.6
 ml/min

 the
 gas-
ﬂow
 rate
 was
 36

 resulting
 in
 a
 1:10

of
 ethylbenzene
 and

 was
 fed
 into
an

 where
 it
 was

 Ethylbenzene

 with
 and
 without
 CO2
Six
 of
 the
 nine
 supported
 catalyst
 samples
 were
 tested
 for
 their
performance
 in
 the
 ethylbenzene
 dehydrogenation,
 in
 both
 car-
bon
 dioxide
 (CO2)
 and
 nitrogen
 (N2)
 diluent.
 Their
 ethylbenzene
conversion
 and
 styrene
 selectivities
 are
 presented
 in
 Fig.
 3.
 All
 six
catalysts
 initially
 show
 a
 difference
 in
 conversion
 for
 the
 CO2 and
N2 diluent,
 in
 favor
 of
 the
 CO2 diluent.
 The
 differences
 in
 selectiv-
ities
 are
 rather
 small,
 in
 CO2 there
 is
 a
 little
 more
 surplus
 H2 and
CO
 (than
 expected
 from
 styrene
 yield).
 In
 the
 ﬁrst
 hours,
 all
 the
selectivities
 increase
 to
 stable
 and
 high
 levels
 of
 92–95%.
 The
 dif-
ferences
 in
 the
 catalyst
 activity
 are
 clearly
 present,
 especially
 for
the
 KV
 catalyst.
 In
 CO2 diluent
 the
 EB
 conversion
 is
 about
 10%
higher
 than
 that
 in
 N2.
 For
 the
 Cr
 catalyst
 the
 difference
 is
 about
 5%,
initially.
 All
 catalysts
 show
 a
 decreasing
 conversion,
 only
 the
 iron
catalysts
 in
 CO2 exhibit
 a
 maximum
 in
 the
 ethylbenzene
 conversion
after
 2–4
 h
 time
 on
 stream.
With
 an
 increase
 in
 time
 on
 stream,
 all
 the
 catalysts
 deactivate.
The
 conversions
 after
 20
 h
 time
 on
 stream
 are
 down
 to
 40–50%,
while
 initially
 they
 had
 an
 EB
 conversion
 between
 70–90%.
 The
 dif-
ferences
 between
 the
 experiments
 using
 CO2 and
 N2 diluent
 are
also
 decreasing
 in
 time.
 For
 most
 catalysts,
 the
 performance
 in
 CO2
or

 almost
 identical
 after

 in

 of
 dehydrogenation
All
 the
 catalysts,
 the
 alumina
 support,
 and
 the
 four-coked
 cata-
lysts
 were
 tested
 for
 their
 RWGS
 performance.
 In
 dehydrogenation,

 results
 in

 production.
 To
simulate

 effect
 on
 the
 RWGS
 activity,
 compared
 to
the
 un-promoted
 chromium
 catalyst.
 The
 coked
 KCr
 catalyst
 shows
that
 coke
 has
 deactivated
 this
 catalyst,
 as
 CO2 conversions
 are
 more
than
 25%
 lower
 than
 the
 fresh
 catalyst.
 The
 iron
 catalyst
 series
(Fig.

 are
 comparable
 to
 the
 chromium
 series.
 The
 potassium
promoter
 enhances
 the
 RWGS
 activity,
 the
 magnesium
 promoter
only
 has
 a
 small
 effect
 on
 the
 CO2 conversion.
 The
 coked
 KFe
 cata-
lyst
 shows,
 again,
 that
 the
 presence
 of
 coke
 deactivates
 the
 RWGS
reaction.
 The
 vanadium
 series
 (Fig.
 4C)
 shows
 a
 different
 trend.
 For
the
 vanadium
 catalyst,
 magnesium
 proves
 to
 be
 a
 better
 promoter
than
 potassium.
 The
 coked
 KV
 catalyst
 does
 not
 seem
 to
 be
 deacti-
vated
 at
 all
 for
 the
 RWGS
 reaction.
 Compared
 to
 the
 other
 vanadium
catalysts,
 it
 actually
 performs
 slightly
 better.
 The
 alumina
 support
(Fig.
 4D)
 does
 show
 some
 CO2 conversion,
 2.5–3.5%,
 but
 this
 is
 dra-
matically
 lower
 than
 all
 the
 other
 catalysts.
 The
 coke
 on
 the
 alumina
sample
 (Al-coke)
 clearly
 deactivated
 the
 RWGS
 reaction
 even
 fur-
ther.
 Its
 conversion
 of
 CO2 is
 lower
 at
 all
 conditions.
 Comparing
 the
potassium
 promoted
 chromium,
 iron,
 and
 vanadium
 catalysts
 with
each
 other
 and
 bare
 alumina
 (Fig.
 4E),
 it
 is
 clear
 that
 KCr
 is
 the
 best
RWGS
 catalyst,
 followed
 closely
 by
 KFe.
 For
 both
 these
 catalysts,
potassium
 is
 a
 good
 promoter
 for
 the
 RWGS
 reaction.
 The
 KV
 cata-
lyst
 or
 bare
 alumina
 are
 not
 good
 RWGS
 catalysts,
 much
 lower
 CO2
conversions
 are
 obtained
 than
 by
 the
 KCr
 and
 KFe
 catalyst.
 Of
 the

 samples
 (Fig.

 the
 iron
 catalyst
 is
 the
 most
 active,
 followed
by
 the
 vanadium
 and
 chromium
 catalysts.

 cata-

 show
 a

 of
 the

 in

 and
 then

 The

 a
 high
 and
 constant
 RWGS

 during
 the
 whole

 its
 RRWGS is
 about
 85%,
 close
to

 The
 RRWGS value
 of
 the
 KCr

 KFe
 cat-
alysts
 are
 much
 lower,
 13%
 and
 20%,
 respectively.
 The
 RRWGS value
for
 the

 is
 very
 low,
 5%,
 and
 is

ing

 Catalyst
 characterization
The
 TPR
 results
 of
 the
 KCr,
 KFe,
 and
 KV
 catalysts
 in
 fresh,
 spent
(after
 RWGS),
 and
 coked
 (after
 dehydrogenation)
 form,
 are
 dis-
played
 in
 Fig.
 7.
 The
 areas
 under
 these
 curves
 have
 been
 calculated
and
 are
 tabulated
 in
 Table
 1.
The
 fresh
 KCr
 sample
 shows
 two
 reduction
 steps,
 a
 large
 peak
around
 350 ◦C
 and
 a
 small
 one
 around
 500 ◦C.
 These
 steps
 can
 be
ascribed
 to
 the
 reduction
 of
 Cr6+ to
 Cr3+ and
 Cr3+ to
 Cr2+,
 respec-
tively
 [20–22].
 On
 the
 fresh
 catalyst,
 almost
 half
 of
 the
 chromia
 is
present
 as
 Cr6+,
 also
 Cr3+ is
 already
 available.
 The
 spent
 and
 coked
catalyst
 do
 not
 show
 any
 peaks
 and
 are
 considered
 to
 be
 in
 the
reduced
 state.
The
 fresh
 KFe
 proﬁle
 also
 consists
 of
 two
 reduction
 steps,
 around
400 ◦C
 and
 around
 550 ◦C.
 The
 ﬁrst
 step
 is
 assigned
 to
 the
 trans-
formation
 of
 Fe2O3–Fe3O4,
 the
 second
 step
 is
 the
 reduction
 of
Fe3O4–FeO
 [23–26].  Within
 the
 error
 of
 the
 measurement,
 the
 full
sample
 is
 reduced
 from
 Fe3+ to
 Fe2+.
 The
 spent
 KFe
 catalyst
 does
not
 show
 distinct
 reduction
 peaks,
 but
 the
 TCD
 signal
 is
 elevated
in
 both
 reduction
 regions,
 therefore
 some
 of
 both
 iron
 phases
 are
probably
 still
 present.
 The
 same
 holds
 for
 the
 coked
 KFe
 sample.
These
 samples
 are
 partly
 reduced
 under
 reaction
 conditions.

 V5+–V4+ [27–30].
The
 fresh
 sample
 is
 completely
 in
 V5+ state.
 In
 the
 spent
 and
 coked
sample,
 most
 vanadium
 is
 in
 V4+ oxidation
 state,
 but
 some
 V5+
is
 still
 present.
 These
 samples
 are
 partly
 reduced
 under
 reaction
conditions.
With
 the
 coked
 catalyst
 samples
 methane
 can
 also
 be
 formed
during
 TPR
 analysis.
 As
 a
 result
 of
 the
 methane
 formation
 the
 TCD
signal
 becomes
 negative,
 even
 though
 H2 is
 consumed.
 Mass
 spec-
troscopy
 showed
 that
 methane
 was
 only
 produced
 above
 650 ◦C.
These
 data
 are
 not
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 7.
The
 amount
 of
 coke
 before
 and
 after
 RWGS
 testing
 of
 the
 coked
catalyst
 samples
 is
 analyzed
 by
 TGA.
 Coke
 is
 deposited
 during
 the
 EB
dehydrogenation
 in
 CO2 over
 these
 catalysts,
 before
 the
 RWGS
 test-
ing.
 The
 results
 in
 Table
 2
 show
 that
 the
 amount
 of
 carbon
 hardly
changes
 during
 the
 RWGS
 testing
 so
 no
 substantial
 coke
 gasiﬁcation
by
 hydrogen,
 steam
 or
 carbon
 dioxide
 takes
 place.
 The
 speciﬁc
 sur-
face
 areas
 of
 the
 fresh
 and
 coked
 catalyst
 samples
 are
 determined
by
 N2 adsorption
 (Table
 2).
 The
 surface
 area
 of
 a
 coked
 catalyst
 is
about
 half
 that
 of
 a
 fresh
 catalyst.
 Among
 the
 fresh
 or
 coked
 catalyst
series,
 the
 differences
 are
 not
 considered
 to
 be
 signiﬁcant.
3.3.
 Step-response
 experiments
Data
 from
 the
 mass
 spectrometer
 (MS)
 on
 CO2 (m/e
 =
 44),
 H2
(m/e
 =
 2),
 CO
 (m/e
 =
 28),
 and
 H2O
 (m/e
 =
 18)
 were
 recorded
 during
the
 step-response
 experiments
 and
 are
 displayed
 in
 Fig.
 8
 for
 the
bare
 alumina
 and
 in
 Fig.
 9
 for
 the
 V
 catalyst.
 Each
 experiment
 took
more
 than
 4
 h
 in
 total.
 The
 y-axis
 is
 arbitrary,
 the
 MS  signals
 of
 CO
and
 CO2 are
 on
 the
 same
 scale,
 but
 the
 orders
 of
 magnitude
 are
different
 from
 H2 and
 from
 H2O.
 The
 data
 can
 only
 be
 compared
qualitatively.
 The
 ratio
 of
 CO–CO2 signal
 is
 also
 given
 on
 the
 right
axis,
 this
 is
 about
 1.2
 when
 only
 CO2 is
 fed
 and
 no
 reaction
 takes
place.
 When
 this
 ratio
 is
 higher
 than
 1.2,
 it
 indicates
 that
 CO
 is
produced.
 In
 between
 each
 period,
 argon
 is
 ﬂowing
 over
 the
 catalyst
to
 ﬂush
 the
 system
 and
 reach
 steady-state
 (base-line)
 MS
 signals.
A
 short
 description
 of
 each
 of
 the
 six
 periods:
1. In
 the
 ﬁrst
 period
 (a–b)
 with
 CO2 only,
 nothing
 special
 is
observed
 from
 the
 MS
 data,
 the
 catalysts
 are
 unaffected.
2.
 The
 second
 period
 (c–d)
 with
 only
 H2,
 on
 both
 samples
 some
CO
 is
 produced
 (the
 CO/CO2 ratio
 is
 larger
 than
 1.2)
 together
with
 H2O.
 The
 bare
 alumina
 produced
 more
 CO,
 and
 is
 known
 to
adsorb
 and/or
 form
 carbonates
 easily
 [31].
 The
 peak
 of
 water
 (c)
and
 delay
 in
 H2 appearance
 indicates
 a
 reduction
 of
 the
 vana-
dium
 catalyst.
 This
 is
 not
 observed
 over
 the
 Al2O3.
3.
 The
 third
 period
 (e–f),
 with
 only
 CO2,
 has
 no
 effect
 on
 the
 Al2O3.
Some
 CO
 is
 produced
 on
 the
 vanadium
 catalyst
 (e)
 without
 pro-
duction
 of
 H2O,
 indicating
 the
 (re)oxidation
 of
 the
 vanadium.
4.
 During
 the
 fourth
 period
 (g–h)
 with
 H2 and
 CO2 feed,
 RWGS
occurs
 on
 both
 catalysts.
 Conversion
 on
 vanadium
 catalyst
 is
much
 higher,
 as
 is
 shown
 by
 the
 ratio
 CO–CO2.
 The
 initial
 peak
 of
the
 CO/CO2 ratio
 at
 (g)
 is
 due
 to
 the
 interaction
 of
 CO2 with
 the
catalysts
 (adsorption
 and
 chemisorption)
 that
 delays
 the
 break-
through
 of
 CO2 compared
 to
 that
 of
 CO.
 This
 effect
 is
 stronger
 on
bare
 Al2O3.
 No
 initial
 peak
 of
 CO
 production
 is
 observed.
5.
 The
 ﬁfth
 period
 (i–j–k–l)
 is
 very
 comparable
 to
 the
 third
 and
fourth
 period
 combined.
 On
 the
 V
 catalyst
 some
 CO
 is
 formed
when
 CO2 feeding
 starts
 (i).
 When
 H2 is
 fed
 together
 with
 CO2
(j–k),
 RWGS
 is
 observed
 on
 Al2O3 and
 V
 catalyst.
 The
 CO2 signal
clearly
 drops
 during
 the
 RWGS
 reaction
 (j–k).
 Over
 Al2O3,
 the
CO
 production
 peaks
 initially,
 then
 evolves
 to
 its
 steady-state
value.
 At
 (k)
 the
 CO
 signal
 from
 Al2O3 drops
 instantaneous.
 The
CO
 signal
 from
 the
 V
 catalyst
 shows
 a
 delay,
 indicating
 again
 the
(re)oxidation
 of
 the
 vanadium.
6.
 The
 sixth
 period
 (m–n–o–p)
 shows
 a
 combination
 of
 the
 second
and
 fourth
 period.
 Some
 CO
 is
 produced
 over
 both
 catalysts
 when
only
 H2 is
 fed
 (m–n),
 with
 both
 feeds
 RWGS
 is
 clearly
 observed
(n–o).
 The
 H2 signal
 clearly
 drops
 when
 CO2 is
 fed
 (n–o).
 When
the
 CO2 feed
 is
 stopped
 (o),
 the
 RWGS
 reaction
 still
 continues,
its
 rate
 decreasing
 quickly.
 The
 CO2 signal
 decreases
 much
 faster
than
 the
 CO
 signal,
 giving
 a
 ratio
 above
 1.2.
Step-response
 experiments
 were
 also
 done
 with
 Cr
 and
 Fe
 cat-
alysts;
 these
 gave
 comparable
 results
 as
 with
 the
 V
 catalyst.
4.
 Discussion
The
 dehydrogenation
 experiments
 clearly
 show
 the
 advantage
of
 using
 CO2 as
 a
 diluent.
 All
 catalysts
 show
 higher
 EB
 conversions
in
 dehydrogenation
 in
 CO2 than
 in
 N2 as
 diluent.

of
 CO2,
 the
 produced
 hydrogen
 can
 be
 removed
 by
 the
 RWGS
 reac-
tion,
 increasing
 the
 equilibrium
 conversion
 of
 EB.
 In
 N2 diluent
 the
H2 product
 cannot
 react.
 Adding
 a
 potassium
 promoter
 to
 these
catalysts
 improves
 the
 EB
 conversion
 in
 CO2 even
 more,
 compared
to
 the
 un-promoted
 catalysts.
 The
 KV
 catalyst
 shows
 the
 highest
RWGS
 activity
 and
 the
 largest
 difference
 between
 the
 CO2 and
 N2
diluent.
 This
 RRWGS value
 indicates
 an
 approach
 of
 85%
 of
 the
 value
at
 equilibrium.
 The
 other
 catalysts
 have
 much
 lower
 activities
 and
also
 have
 smaller
 differences
 between

 A
high
 RWGS

 is
 necessary
 for
 an
 improved
 dehydrogena-
tion
 performance
 in
 CO2.
 A
 medium
 or
 low
 RWGS
 activity
 will

 Vanadium

A
 comparison
 based
 on
 RRWGS values
 is
 a
 better
 measure,
 because
of
 the
 reversible
 nature
 of
 the
 (R)WGS
 reaction.
 Chromium
 is
 easily
reduced
 to
 Cr3+ as
 shown
 in
 the
 TPR
 proﬁle
 in
 Fig.
 7
 and
 has
 stable
activity
 during
 the
 experiment,
 as
 the
 RRWGS parameter
 shows
 in
Fig.
 5.
 Iron
 is
 partially
 reduced
 during
 the
 experiment,
 all
 oxidized
states
 seem
 to
 be
 present
 in
 the
 spent
 catalyst.
 During
 the
 experi-
ment,
 RRWGS is
 going
 down,
 indicating
 that
 the
 catalyst
 deactivates.
A
 slow
 transformation
 of
 the
 iron
 species
 into
 inactive
 Fe2+ could
 be
responsible
 for
 the
 deactivation
 [32].
 Vanadium
 shows
 the
 lowest
RRWGS values.
 Both
 V5+ and
 V4+ are
 present
 after
 reaction.
 Adding
a
 magnesium
 promoter
 to
 the
 catalysts
 shows
 a
 positive
 effect
 for
vanadium.
 The
 potassium
 promoter
 improves
 the
 activity
 of
 both
iron
 and
 chromium
 catalysts.
 The
 enhanced
 adsorption
 CO2 of
 due
to
 the
 basicity
 of
 the
 potassium,
 and
 hence
 a
 higher
 intermediate
concentration,
 is
 thought
 to
 be
 the
 reason
 for
 this
 improvement.
The
 potassium
 can
 also
 assist
 in
 the
 oxygen
 transfer
 to
 the
 iron
 or
chromium
 oxide
 in
 the
 redox
 mechanism
 (see
 below).
Although
 different
 catalysts
 are
 tested
 with
 different
 promoters,
none
 of
 them
 reach
 the
 equilibrium
 conversion
 under
 the
 testing
conditions.
 Even
 changing
 the
 gas
 composition
 in
 the
 RWGS
 exper-
iments
 does
 not
 have
 an
 effect
 on
 RRWGS,
 even
 though
 the
 hydrogen
concentration
 changes
 from
 5%
 to
 9%.
 Of
 course
 the
 conversion
changes
 (Fig.
 4),
 but
 with
 a
 different
 composition
 the
 equilibrium
conversion
 changes
 as
 well.
 For
 these
 reasons
 we  compare
 activ-
ities
 based
 on
 the
 RRWGS.
 It
 appears
 that
 the
 change
 in
 hydrogen
concentration
 balances
 the
 effect
 of
 varying
 the
 hydrogen
 contact
time
 with
 the
 catalyst,
 giving
 equal
 RRWGS values.
 A
 better
 RWGS
catalyst
 should
 be
 made
 by
 improving
 its
 hydrogen
 dissociation
 and
CO2 oxidation
 properties.
 This
 can
 possibly
 be
 achieved
 by
 intro-
ducing
 noble
 metals,
 and
 by
 introducing
 more
 and
 stronger
 basic
sites.
The
 fact
 that
 none
 of
 the
 catalysts
 have
 a
 RRWGS value
 larger
 than
one
 (CO
 concentrations
 higher
 than
 expected
 from
 equilibrium
conversion)
 suggests
 that
 the
 two-step
 pathway
 with
 RWGS
 and
dehydrogenation
 is
 most
 likely.
 In
 case
 of
 the
 one-step
 pathway,
much
 more
 CO
 product
 would
 be
 expected,
 giving
 RRWGS values
larger
 than
 one.
 Sun
 et
 al.
 [17]
 analyses
 the
 one-step
 and
 two-
step
 mechanism
 slightly
 different,
 the
 one-step
 pathway
 being
 the
reaction
 of
 CO2 with
 adsorbed
 hydrogen
 from
 the
 dehydrogenation
reaction
 and
 the
 two-step
 pathway
 would
 be
 the
 reaction
 between
molecular
 hydrogen
 and
 CO2.
 This
 will
 however
 both
 give
 the
 same
end
 result
 (both
 H2 and
 CO
 can
 be
 produced)
 and
 does
 not
 differen-
tiate
 one
 pathway
 from
 the
 other.
 The
 difference
 between
 the
 one-
and
 two-step
 pathway
 is
 sometimes
 also
 simpliﬁed
 by
 assigning
all
 the
 CO2 converted
 to
 the
 one-step
 pathway
 and
 all
 the
 formed
H2 to
 the
 two-step
 pathway
 [2].  This
 ignores
 the
 fact
 that
 in
 the
two-step
 pathway
 both
 H2 and
 CO
 are
 formed.
The
 step-response
 experiments
 give
 mechanistic
 information
on
 the
 RWGS
 reaction.
 Both
 the
 alumina
 supported
 vanadia
 cat-
alyst
 and
 the
 bare
 alumina
 show
 RWGS
 activity.
 The
 activity
 is
the
 highest
 for
 the
 V
 catalyst.
 Carbon
 dioxide
 is
 easily
 transformed
into
 carbonate
 on
 the
 alumina
 support
 surface
 and
 is
 converted
into
 CO
 and
 H2O
 when
 H2 is
 fed
 (associative
 mechanism).
 On
 the
 V
catalyst,
 part
 of
 the
 alumina
 surface
 is
 not
 covered
 with
 vanadia.
Some
 carbonates
 are
 still
 formed,
 but
 less
 than
 on
 the
 bare
 sup-
port,
 leading
 to
 lower
 amounts
 of
 CO
 with
 the
 V
 catalyst
 in
 the
period
 (c–d).
 Hydrogen
 does
 not
 appear
 to
 adsorb,
 as
 no
 RWGS
is
 observed
 at
 (e–f)
 over
 both
 catalysts.
 Hydrogen
 does,
 however,
reduce
 the
 vanadium
 in
 the
 period
 (c–d)
 (redox
 mechanism).
 When
CO2 is
 fed
 after
 the
 reduction,
 it
 is
 initially
 converted
 into
 CO
 by
 oxi-
dizing
 the
 vanadium
 (e–f)
 until
 the
 vanadium
 cannot
 be
 oxidized
further
 (redox
 mechanism).
 These
 experiments
 show
 the
 clear
 dif-
ferences
 between
 the
 two
 mechanisms
 proposed
 in
 the
 literature,
the
 redox
 and
 associative
 mechanism
 [9].  A
 simpliﬁed
 reaction
scheme
 is
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 10.  On
 the
 support
 only
 the
 associative
RWGS
 mechanism
 takes
 place
 and
 on
 the
 metal
 oxide
 catalyst
 the
redox
 mechanism.
 On
 a
 supported
 metal
 oxide
 catalyst
 both
 mech-
anisms
 have
 to
 take
 place,
 because
 the
 catalyst
 loading
 is
 below
monolayer
 coverage.
 As
 the
 activity
 of
 the
 supported
 catalyst
 is
much
 higher
 than
 that
 of
 the
 support
 alone,
 the
 redox
 mechanism
has
 the
 largest
 contribution
 to
 the
 RWGS
 activity.
The
 dehydrogenation
 experiments
 also
 show
 a
 large
 challenge
that
 needs
 to
 be
 (re)solved:
 the
 catalyst
 deactivation
 by
 the
 exces-
sive
 coke
 formation.
 All
 the
 tested
 catalysts
 deactivate.
 When
 the
catalysts
 deactivate,
 the
 beneﬁcial
 effect
 of
 CO2 disappears.
 Coke
is
 not
 active
 for
 the
 RWGS
 reaction,
 but
 a
 limited
 amount
 of
 coke
needs
 to
 be
 present
 for
 selective
 dehydrogenation
 [18].
 Therefore
the
 coked
 catalysts
 from
 the
 dehydrogenation
 reaction
 are
 also
tested
 for
 their
 RWGS
 activity
 without
 dehydrogenation
 (Fig.
 6).
This
 should
 give
 a
 more
 realistic
 view
 on
 the
 role
 of
 the
 RWGS
 in
the
 EB
 dehydrogenation
 because
 the
 catalyst
 composition
 is
 closer
to
 the
 actual
 catalyst
 during
 dehydrogenation
 in
 CO2.
 The
 iron
 and
chromium
 catalysts
 are
 clearly
 deactivated
 due
 to
 the
 presence
 of
coke
 on
 the
 catalyst
 surface
 that
 can
 block
 the
 active
 RWGS
 sites,
but
 the
 vanadium
 catalyst
 shows
 the
 opposite.
 The
 presence
 of
 coke
enhances
 the
 RWGS
 activity
 of
 the
 vanadium
 catalyst,
 although
 the
coke
 itself
 does
 not
 show
 RWGS
 activity.
 The
 differences
 in
 the
RRWGS (Fig.
 6)
 between
 the
 coked
 catalysts
 are
 much
 smaller
 than
that
 for
 the
 fresh
 catalysts.
Comparing
 the
 RRWGS values
 from
 the
 fresh
 catalysts
 in
 dehy-
drogenation
 (Fig.
 5)
 and
 in
 RWGS
 experiments
 (Fig.
 6),
 there
 seems
to
 be
 no
 correlation.
 The
 poorest
 catalyst
 for
 RWGS,
 KV,
 is
 the
 best
catalyst
 for
 dehydrogenation
 in
 CO2 with
 the
 highest
 CO2 conver-
sion.
 This
 is
 consistent
 with
 other
 literature
 results
 [17].
 Fresh
 KCr
and
 KFe
 catalysts
 start
 with
 similar
 activities
 for
 the
 RWGS
 and
dehydrogenation,
 but
 deactivate
 during
 the
 process
 of
 the
 dehy-
drogenation
 due
 to
 the
 coke
 formation
 and
 possibly
 over-reduction
of
 the
 metal
 oxide
 as
 in
 case
 of
 KFe.
 The
 increase
 in
 RWGS
 activity
under
 dehydrogenation
 conditions
 of
 the
 KV
 catalyst
 is
 striking.
 As
a
 plausible
 explanation
 it
 is
 speculated
 that
 the
 coke,
 where
 the
dehydrogenation
 takes
 place
 and
 the
 hydrogen
 is
 generated,
 func-
tions
 as
 a
 hydrogen
 supply
 to
 the
 RWGS
 catalyst.
 The
 hydrogen
spills
 over
 from
 the
 coke
 to
 the
 metal
 sites.
 This
 system
 shows
 the
typical
 characteristics
 of
 spill-over,
 where
 the
 sum
 (CO2 conver-
sion
 during
 the
 dehydrogenation
 in
 CO2)
 is
 much
 larger
 than
 the
separate
 parts
 (CO2 conversion
 during
 RWGS)
 [33–36].
 The
 RWGS
activity
 over
 the
 alumina
 support
 is
 low,
 as
 is
 also
 the
 case
 for
 the
V
 and
 KV
 catalysts.
 Coke
 has
 a
 positive
 effect
 on
 the
 RWGS
 activity
(and
 CO2 conversion)
 of
 the
 KV
 catalyst,
 but
 when
 adsorbed
 hydro-
gen
 is
 produced
 from
 the
 dehydrogenation
 the
 CO2 conversion
 is
much
 higher
 (and
 the
 associated
 RWGS
 activity).
 In
 this
 case
 it
 is
not
 necessary
 that
 molecular
 hydrogen
 dissociates,
 as
 the
 hydrogen
atoms
 are
 already
 provided
 by
 the
 dehydrogenation
 reaction.
 This
can
 explain
 the
 similar
 activities
 of
 all
 the
 coked
 catalysts,
 where
hydrogen
 spill-over
 is
 the
 rate
 determining
 step
 in
 RWGS.
 Without
coke
 and
 dehydrogenation,
 hydrogen
 dissociation
 is
 very
 likely
 the
rate-limiting
 step
 on
 the
 vanadium
 catalyst.
The
 observations
 also
 have
 its
 consequences
 for
 the
 mechanism
of
 dehydrogenation
 in
 CO2.
 Returning
 to
 the
 proposed
 pathways
 by
Sun
 et
 al.
 (Fig.
 2),
 step
 2–2
 seems
 to
 be
 of
 minor
 importance.
 Their
“one-step”
 mechanism
 is
 already
 constituted
 of
 a
 dehydrogenation,
a
 hydrogen
 spill-over,
 and
 a
 RWGS
 step.
 During
 the
 dehydrogena-
tion
 in
 CO2,
 coke
 is
 always
 present.
 All
 the
 coked
 catalysts
 yield
similar
 CO2 conversions
 in
 RWGS,
 even
 though
 the
 fresh
 cata-
lysts
 have
 very
 different
 and
 higher
 RWGS
 activities.
 The
 RWGS
activity
 of
 the
 catalysts
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 dehydrogenation
 in
 CO2
is
 not
 changing,

 It

 also
 pos-

 that

 the

 Conclusions
The
 reverse
 water–gas-shift
 reaction
 is
 an
 important
 part
 of
dehydrogenation
 in
 CO2.
 However,
 a
 direct
 correlation
 between
 the
catalytic
 RWGS
 activity
 in
 the
 absence
 and
 presence
 of
 dehydro-
genation
 was
 not
 found.
 The
 presence
 of
 coke
 and
 the
 combination
with
 a
 dehydrogenation
 reaction
 have
 a
 different
 inﬂuence
 on
 the
catalytic
 RWGS
 reaction,
 depending
 on
 the
 catalyst.
 Hydrogen
 for
the
 RWGS
 reaction
 originates
 from
 adsorbed
 hydrogen,
 generated
in
 the
 dehydrogenation,
 that
 spills
 over
 from
 the
 coke
 to
 the
 RWGS
catalyst.
 A
 new
 mechanism,
 including
 the
 hydrogen
 spill-over,
 is
proposed.
 RWGS
 activity
 in
 the
 presence
 and
 absence
 of
 dehydro-
genation
 cannot
 be
 compared.
 The
 RWGS
 activity
 of
 the
 KV
 catalyst
is
 even
 enhanced.
 The
 dominant
 routes
 are
 the
 redox
 mechanism
for
 the
 RWGS
 reaction
 and
 the
 two-step
 pathway
 for
 the
 dehydro-
genation
 in
 CO2.
