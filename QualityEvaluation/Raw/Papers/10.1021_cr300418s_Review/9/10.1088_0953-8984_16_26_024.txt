Abstract
Recent experimental results (Hoeft et al 2001 Phys. Rev. Lett. 87 086101)
have questioned the capability of current theoretical methods for describing
the bonding of NH3, CO, and NO with the NiO(100) surface.
We show
that these systems do indeed represent a challenge to theory. For different
reasons, density functional theory (DFT) fails in describing the bonding of
these molecules to the NiO surface. The gradient-corrected functionals which
work better for the properties of NH3/NiO and CO/NiO (energies, geometries,
vibrations) provide wrong answers for NO/NiO and vice versa. This is not
due to the well-known difﬁculty as regards DFT describing the insulating
character of NiO. In fact, exactly the same problem is found for isolated Ni2+
impurities in MgO. A correct description of the bonding of both closed-shell
(NH3 and CO) and open-shell (NO) molecules to NixMg1−xO is obtained only
after inclusion of dynamical correlation and dispersion forces via wavefunction-
based methods. However, even with correlated calculations some uncertainties
exist regarding the predicted value of the energy of adsorption of NO on NiO.
While CASPT2 calculations reach reasonable agreement with experiment, the
results of approximate coupled-cluster calculations (the multi-conﬁguration
coupled-electron-pair approach) substantially underestimate the adsorption
energy.

1. Introduction
A correct description of the bonding of molecular complexes to transition metal oxide surfaces
is of fundamental importance for the understanding of problems in catalysis, gas sensors,
corrosion protection, etc. The bonding of simple molecules such as NH3, CO, and NO to
metal oxides represents a serious challenge to theorists. A recent experimental paper on
the structure of these molecules on NiO(100) [1, 2] has highlighted the weakness of current
theoretical descriptions of oxide–molecule bonding, in particular as regards the bond lengths
(and hence the bond strengths). Nowadays, two basically different approaches are used to
describe the bonding at surfaces. Wavefunction-based methods with explicit inclusion of
correlation effects (e.g. through conﬁguration interaction or perturbative treatments) were
developed in the 1980s and 1990s and can be applied within the local cluster model approach.
Their use is not straightforward and their application is restricted to relatively small systems.
This is one reason for the wide use of density functional theory (DFT) in the description
of the surface chemical bonding and of the electronic structure of solids and surfaces [3].
Historically, DFT was developed to perform band structure calculations where periodic
boundary conditions are properly taken into account. Thanks to the introduction of hybrid
exchange–correlation functionals, the description of bond dissociation energies in molecular
complexes has also approached so-called ‘chemical accuracy’ (errors < 1 kcal mol−1).
However, recent studies on some special problems (magnetic coupling [4], localized holes
in insulators [5, 6], weakly interacting systems [7, 8], etc) have shown limitations of DFT
which may lead to a physically incorrect picture or to a strong dependence of the results on
the exchange–correlation functional.
The adsorption properties of NH3, CO, and NO on NiO(100) and Ni-doped MgO(100)
have been determined experimentally in detail and represent a unique opportunity to test theory.
Photoelectron diffraction studies of NiO(100) thin ﬁlms show that NO is bound with a Ni–N
distance of 1.88 Å and a tilt angle of 59◦from the surface normal [1]; CO binds almost normal
to the surface with a Ni–C distance of 2.07 Å [1, 2]; a similar distance, 2.06 Å, is measured for
NH3 [1, 2]. Thermally programmed desorption (TPD) studies on NiO single crystals show that
the desorption energy of NO, 0.57 eV, is about twice that of CO, 0.30 eV [9]. According to a
crude estimate from TPD spectra of NH3 adsorbed on NiO thin ﬁlms [10], this molecule is the
most strongly bound, with a desorption energy of about 0.8 eV [1, 2]. Infra-red spectra of NiO
powders show that while the frequency of adsorbed NO is red-shifted compared to that of the
free molecule, ω = −71 cm−1 [11], that of CO is slightly blue-shifted, ω = +9 cm−1 [12].
Ni2+ ions diluted in a MgO matrix behavein a very similar way to Ni2+ ions in the extended NiO
surface: the CO vibrational frequencies are virtually the same in the two systems [11, 13]; the
desorption temperatures of NO adsorbed on Ni-doped MgO and NiO are very similar [14, 15];
for a more extended discussion see also [16]. The physical reason is that the bonding of CO
and NO to the Ni ion is very local and only marginally depends on the matrix in which the
ion is included. Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements on NO adsorbed on NiO/MgO
solid solutions show a single unpaired electron in the 3d shell of Ni (formally Ni+ 3d9) [17].
In this work we report a theoretical study where the bonding of the three molecules
to NiO and Ni-doped MgO is treated using both DFT and wavefunction-based methods. The
calculations have been done within the cluster approach and compared with results for periodic
slabs in selected cases. We will show that the DFT results exhibit a strong dependence on the
exchange–correlation functional used and that in some cases this results in a qualitatively
wrong picture of the interaction. Functionals which provide the best answers for NH3/NiO
and CO/NiO are inadequate to describe the bonding in NO/NiO and vice versa. A correct
solution requires explicitly correlated wavefunctionsgenerated by complete-active-spaceSCF,

CASSCF, and second-order perturbation theory, CASPT2, approaches [18, 19] or the multi-
conﬁguration coupled-electron-pair approach (MC-CEPA) method [20]. In this case also,
however, some uncertainties about the bonding properties remain, mainly due to the difﬁculty
of approaching a full CI treatment and selecting the proper conﬁgurations involved in the
differential electronic correlation effects.
2. Computational methods
Both spin-polarized and spin-restricted calculations have been performed. A spin-polarized
DFT calculation corresponds to an unrestricted HF approach, UHF, and, as such, cannot
rigorously describe the spin multiplicity of an open-shell system. In fact, the spin-polarized
calculations resulted in severe spin-contamination problems, as will be discussed below.
Therefore, the calculations have been performed also using the restricted open-shell (RO)
formalism.
In this case the corresponding electronic states are pure triplet states for the
adsorption of a closed-shell molecule on an isolated Ni2+ impurity in MgO and pure doublet
or pure quartet states for NO/NiO.
Correlation effects can be included, based on DFT. In the Kohn–Shamformulationof DFT,
the exact non-local HF exchange for a single determinant is replaced by a general expression,
the exchange–correlationfunctional, which can include both exchangeand electron correlation
energy terms. Here we used three different approaches; one of them is a pure DFT method
and the other two are hybrid approaches where the exchange interaction is described partially
or entirely by the HF exchange. In the pure DFT scheme, we used the approach based on
the gradient-corrected exchange functional proposed by Becke [21] combined with the non-
local expression of the correlation functional proposed by Lee, Yang, and Parr (BLYP) [22],
which goes back to the original work of Colle and Salvetti [23, 24] on the correlation factor.
In one hybrid approach the exchange term was entirely described at the HF level (100% HF
exchange) while the correlation part made use of the LYP correlation functional described
above; this approach is referred to as HFLYP. A second hybrid approach makes use of the
hybrid B3LYP method where the HF exchange is mixed in with the DF exchange using the
Becke three-parameter approach [25].
For CO/NiO the model of the NiO surface consists ofa Ni9O9 cluster embedded in effective
core potentials (ECP) and a 3×3×2 set of point charges(PC = ±2) to represent the crystalline
Madelung potential; see table 1. The geometry was ﬁxed to the ideal rock-salt structure of bulk
NiO with a lattice constant of 4.16 Å [26]; no geometrical relaxation at the NiO(100) surface
was allowed for. The calculations, performed with the GAUSSIAN98 program [27], have
been compared with periodic calculations carried out with the CRYSTAL code [28] on three
slabs of NiO for a CO coverage θ = 0.25 monolayers. On Ni9O9 we assumed a ferromagnetic
coupling of the spins on the Ni atoms; in the periodic calculation the correct antiferromagnetic
ordering has been used [29]. The differences in CO/NiO properties obtained with cluster and
slab are smaller than 0.03 Å for the bond lengths, 0.02 eV for the binding energy, and 7 cm−1
for the frequencies; see table 1.
For NH3 and NO most of the calculations have been performed for a NiMg8O9 model of
an isolated Ni2+ impurity on the MgO(100) surface; see ﬁgure 1 and tables 2 and 3. Here,
an undistorted MgO rock-salt structure was used [26]. As already mentioned above, the
behaviour of Ni2+ ions diluted in a MgO matrix is analogous to that of Ni2+ ions in the
extended NiO surface. This has been veriﬁed theoretically by comparing CO on NiMg8O9 and
Ni9O9 cluster models: within a given method, the results are the same within ≈0.05 eV for
the energies and 0.03 Å for the distances; see table 1. For the speciﬁc case of NO we also
performed periodic slab calculations; see table 3. Given the tilt angle of the NO molecule, the

coverage dependence of the results has been analysed by considering two coverages, θ = 0.25
and 0.125 monolayers. The properties computed for NO/NiO(100) slabs are similar to those
obtained with theNO/NiMg8O9 cluster; seetable3. ThisjustiﬁestheuseofNiMg8O9 instead of
a Ni9O9 cluster. One practical advantage in using a NiMg8O9 model is that NO/Ni9O9 clusters
result sometimes in severe convergence or spin-contamination problems due to the complex
spin coupling (see below).
The cluster wavefunctions have been constructed using localized Gaussian-type basis
sets of triple-zeta-plus-polarization quality. The basis set for NiMg8O9 is 6-31G for Mg,
[16s8p2d/6s5p2d]for O [30], and [22s14p6d/7s6p3d]for Ni [31] (see also basis set B in [32]).
The basis set for Ni9O9 is 6-311 + G for Ni [33], and 6-311 + G∗[34] for O (see basis set C
in [32]); this basis set has been used in a parallel study of CO adsorption at the NiO(100)
surface [29], and is similar in quality to the basis set used for NiMg8O9. The 6-311 + G∗[34]

basis set was used for the NH3, CO, and NO molecules. The adsorption energies have been
corrected using the counterpoise method to remove the basis set superposition error (BSSE)
inherent to the use of localized basis functions [35].
The DFT results have been complemented by wavefunction-based calculations with
explicit inclusion of correlation effects employing the CASSCF, CASPT2, and MC-CEPA
approaches. Clusters and basis sets are the same as for DFT. However, we restricted the
CASPT2 analysis to CO and NO adsorbates and to NiMg8O9 models, since calculations on a
Ni9O9 cluster, possible in principle, are quite complex because of the large number of possible
spin couplings in the 3d manifold all within a very small energy interval.
CASPT2 is a generalization of the well-known MP2 method based on HF wavefunctions
to CASSCF wavefunctions and reduces rigorously to MP2 for CAS containing a single closed-
shell Slater determinant (i.e. for a single HF wavefunction).
Some part of the electron
correlation effect is treated in a variational way in the CASSCF step, and the remainder,
S2502
G Pacchioni et al
mainly dynamical electron correlation, is estimated by second-order perturbation theory with
the CASSCF as the zeroth-order wavefunction. This strategy combines the accuracy of a
multi-reference CI treatment and the low computational cost of a perturbational approach.
Over the last few years the CASPT2 method has been proven to be a fruitful approach for
studying, analysing, and predicting the spectroscopy of a wide range of organic and inorganic
molecules [36–39]. The method has also been successfully applied for studying excited states
in solid-state compounds [40–42].
CASSCF and CASPT2 interaction energy curves have been determined by single-point
calculations as functions of the distance of CO or NO from the Ni cation (the C–O or N–O
distances have been kept ﬁxed at 1.13 and 1.17 Å, respectively; a tilt angle ϑ = 60◦has been
assumed for NO while CO is normal to the surface). In a ﬁrst set of CASSCF calculations on
NO/NiMg8O9 (CASSCF-A) the active space includes the Ni 3d(z2) and 3d(x2 −y2) orbitals,
two diffuse Ni 4d(z2) and 4d(x2 −y2) orbitals, and the π∗(x) and π∗(y) antibonding orbitals
on NO and three active electrons. For CO/NiMg8O9, the active space includes the CO 5σ,
6σ ∗, 1π, 2π∗and the Ni 3d(z2), 3d(x2 −y2), 3d(xz)3d(yz) orbitals and twelve electrons. In
CASPT2, a second-order estimate of the total energy is calculated by correlating a total of 162
(CO) and 163 (NO) valence electrons (CASPT2-A). The bonding of NO to NiO represents a
particularly complex case so another calculation has been performed on NO/NiMg8O9 using a
larger basis set (CASPT2-B). In particular, we used the atomic natural orbitals (ANO) basis set
given by Roos et al [43, 44]. The contraction scheme of the basis used for the NiMg8O9 is as
follows: [17s12p/3s2p] for Mg, [14s9p4d/6s5p2d]for O, and [21s15p10d6f/8s6p3d1f]for Ni.
For the NO molecule the contraction scheme is [14s9p4d/5s4p2d]. For the CASSCF–CASPT2
calculations we used the MOLCAS 5 package [45].
A less approximate way of including dynamical correlation effects on top of a HF or
CASSCF calculation is to employ a coupled-cluster method. In the present study, we have
used the MC-CEPA scheme developed by Fink and Staemmler [19] which is an approximate
multi-conﬁguration coupled-cluster method. It is, in contrast to CISD methods, exactly size
consistent, but contains certain approximations for complicated matrix elements [20]. The
present implementationcan make use of three variants: the genuine MC-CEPA approximation,
a variant-averaged coupled-pair functional (ACPF) as proposed by Gdanitz and Ahlrichs [46],
and a linearized version, CEPA-0, in which all matrix elements not necessary to ensure size
consistency are completely neglected. In all applications so far we found that MC-CEPA and
ACPF correlation energies are quite similar and rather close to full CI results as well, whenever
a comparison was possible, while CEPA-0 generally overestimates correlation effects. Similar
observations have been made by other authors using related approaches [47].
In the present study, we have performed single point MC-CEPA calculations for NO/NiO
employing the same cluster geometry and nearly the same basis sets as in the DFT and CASPT2
calculations. However, in order to keep the computer time low, we identiﬁed all doubly
occupied orbitals in the cluster and included only the valence orbitals at Ni, at the O atoms
adjacent to the Ni adsorption site, and at the NO molecule in the correlation treatment.
3. Results and discussion
NH3, CO, and NO bind to the NiO surface through completely different mechanisms. NH3 and
CO interact mainly electrostatically with the Ni2+3d8 surface cation (the 3B2 ground state in
C4v), with very small covalent bonding contributions[48]; the bonding arises from polarization
and dispersion forces with no change of Ni2+ spin state.
The bonding in NO/NiO and
NO/NiMg8O9 implies interaction of the paramagnetic NO molecule, the 2 ground state,
with a magnetic Ni2+ ion in an open-shell 3d8, 3B2, conﬁguration.
The coupling of the

unpaired electrons on the two fragments results in four electronic states, 2A′, 2A′′, 4A′,
4A′′ (Cs symmetry) [49].
Only one of them, 2A′′, is bonding, in agreement with ESR
measurements [17]; the other three states exhibit purely repulsive potential energy curves,
ﬁgure 1.
First we consider the bonding of the three molecules as described by the popular hybrid
B3LYP approach. At the U-B3LYP level CO/Ni9O9 and CO/NiMg8O9 are almost unbound
complexes, with De = 0.02 and 0.06 eV, respectively, despite a distance from the surface,
2.10 Å, close to the experimental one; see table 1. For NH3/NiMg8O9 we found at the same
level a weak bonding, De = 0.23 eV, much lower than in the experiment, and a distance
from the surface, 2.19 Å, which is ≈0.13 Å longer than the measured one [1, 2]; see table 2.
It is important to note that the spin contamination is small for both NH3 and CO surface
complexes and the expectation value of ⟨S2⟩is within 0.02 of the nominal value for a triplet
state. This is indicative of the single-reference nature ofthe ground state. For NO/NiMg8O9 the
U-B3LYP approach gives De = 0.25 eV (BSSE corrected), a Ni–N distance of 2.02 Å, but
a spin distribution which is contrary to experiment; see table 3. ⟨S2⟩is 1.41 instead of that
expected for a doublet state, 0.75, indicating a substantial spin contamination. The spin
distribution shows the presence of three unpaired electrons, two with spin up on Ni and one
with spin down on NO, at variance with the ESR experiment [17]. This is indicative of a
multi-reference character of the ground state [32, 49]. Similar results are obtained when we
model the NiO surface by a NiO slab; see the NO/NiO U-B3LYP results for θ = 0.25 in
table 3. The binding energy, however, is considerably smaller, De = 0.07 eV after BSSE.
This is due in part to adsorbate–adsorbate repulsions. In fact, repeating the calculation for
θ = 0.125 (the geometry has not been reoptimized), De becomes 0.16 eV. Apart from the
slightly different energy, the NiMg8O9 cluster and the NiO slab give similar properties and
incorrect spin distributions, showing that the problem cannot be treated properly within this
DFT approach. If the B3LYP calculation is repeated using the RO formalism so that the
corresponding solution is forced to be an eigenfunction of the ⟨S2⟩spin operator (pure 2A′′
state; ﬁgure 1), then the geometry is similar to the spin-polarized solution but the interaction
energy is close to zero; see table 3. The other wrong prediction ofthe B3LYP approach is for the
vibrational shifts of adsorbed CO and NO. For NO/NiMg8O9, ω (RO-B3LYP) = −209 cm−1
is three times the experimental value, −71 cm−1; ω (U-B3LYP) = −110 cm−1 is better but
still overestimated; see table 3. For CO/Ni9O9 even the direction of the shift is wrong (theory:
ω = −73 cm−1; experiment: ω = +9 cm−1 [12]; see table 1). Clearly, the B3LYP method
does not provide a satisfactory description of the three bonds.
We have further considered the ‘pure’ BLYP gradient-corrected exchange–correlation
functional. At the BLYP level, NH3/NiMg8O9 with De = 0.16 eV is underbound—table 2;
CO/NiMg8O9 with De = 0.30 eV matches the experimental result perfectly—table 1; while
NO/NiMg8O9 is overbound, De = 0.96 eV—table 3. Probably BLYP underestimates the
dispersion contribution to the bonding of NH3 to ionic substrates, while it overestimates the
covalent contribution in NO/NiO. For NO and especially for CO, the distance from the surface
is too short. This results in a strong overlap with the Ni 3d orbitals and in an excessive back-
donation of charge into the antibonding levels of the adsorbed molecule. The consequence
is that the CO vibrational shift is −172 cm−1, instead of +9 cm−1—table 1; for NO, ω
is −292 cm−1 instead of −71 cm−1—table 3. Thus, the BLYP method is also completely
inadequate for describing the bonding at the NiO surface. Notice that the Perdew–Wang GGA
approach provides results (not reported here for brevity) similar to the BLYP ones. LDA
appears to be totally inadequate since it fails even to correctly predict NiO as an insulator [50].
As a last example of exchange–correlation functionals, we have considered the HFLYP
approach. Notice that hybrid DFT approaches such as HFLYP give a rather good description
S2504
G Pacchioni et al
of the properties of bulk NiO [51, 52]. In HFLYP, for CO/Ni9O9, De = 0.15 eV is somewhat
smaller than the experimental value; the Ni–C distance, 2.38 Å, is 0.21 Å longer than in
the experiment; and ω is −10 cm−1 instead of +9 cm−1—table 1. For NH3/NiMg8O9,
De = 0.49 eV is slightly smaller than the experimental estimate and the Ni–N bond distance is
0.1 Å too long—table 2. These results are far from being satisfactory. Still, HFLYP provides
the best overall description of the bonding characteristics of CO/NiO and NH3/NiO among
the functionals considered. Unfortunately, the same HFLYP approach gives a completely
wrong description of NO/NiO; see table 3. The calculations are done at the RO level to avoid
spin-contamination problems. Only the bond length, 1.82 Å for NiMg8O9 and 1.78 Å for
a NiO slab, is reproduced with an acceptable error. The minimum of the 2A′′ curve for
NiMg8O9—see ﬁgure 1—lies 3.53 eV above the dissociation limit (3.90 eV with a NiO slab)
and ω, −404 cm−1, is ﬁve times larger than the experimental one! The reason for this
failure lies in the description of the on-site Coulomb repulsion in Ni2+. The coupling of the
NO spin with the Ni2+ unpaired electrons results formally in a change of Ni conﬁguration
from 3d8 to 3d9. This can be related to the electron afﬁnity (EA) of the Ni2+ cation in NiO,
a key parameter in determining the Hubbard U-parameter in magnetic insulators. EA for the
process NiMg8O9 + e−→[NiMg8O9]−changes dramatically as a function of the amount
of HF exchange which is mixed in with the DFT exchange and goes from −2.7 eV in BLYP
to −6 eV in HFLYP! The ordering of the 2A′′ curves follows the same trend; see ﬁgure 1.
Thus, the 3d intra-shell Coulomb repulsion is substantially overestimated when the exchange
is treated at the HF level. This is associated also with the level of spin localization: in HFLYP
the spin is localized by 94% on the Ni 3d orbital; in BLYP the localization is reduced to 68%;
see table 3.
These results show unambiguously the problems of the DFT approach for describing
the bonding of NH3, CO, and NO to NiO or Ni-doped MgO surfaces. Therefore, we made
use of wavefunction-based methods where the dynamical correlation, spin state, and multi-
reference character of the wavefunction are treated explicitly on an equal footing by means of
the CASSCF, CASPT2, and MC-CEPA approaches.
The 3B2 curves of CO/NiMg8O9 and the 2A′′ and 4A′′ curves of NO/NiMg8O9 have been
determined by considering several single-point geometries. The only geometrical parameter
which has been varied is the distance of CO or NO from the Ni cation. The bonding of
CO to NiMg8O9 is dominated by electrostatic and dispersion terms and does not involve any
spin change in the surface complex. At the CASSCF level the complex is unbound while in
CASPT2 the minimum is found for r(Ni–C) = 2.24 Å, with a De = 0.13 eV; see table 1. This
means that the distance is overestimated and that the bonding is about 50% of the experimental
one. The CO vibrational frequency exhibits a shift, ω = +16 cm−1, with the right sign and
an absolute value close to the measured one, +9 cm−1; see table 1. In this respect, CASPT2
represents a clear improvement in the description of the complex, since all properties are
determined with acceptable errors. The case of NO is somewhat more complex.
The key aspect of the bonding mechanism in NO/NiMg8O9 is the coupling of the unpaired
electrons in the Ni 3d(z2) orbital with that in the NO 2π∗antibonding level [49]. First of all
we notice that the CASSCF wavefunction does indeed result from a mixing of conﬁgurations,
conﬁrming the multi-reference character of the doublet state. However, no bonding is found at
theCASSCFlevel. The 2A′′ curveisin factpurely repulsive,asisthe 4A′′ one. SinceaCASSCF
wavefunction includes mainly non-dynamical correlation, one can deduce that the dynamical
correlation is essential for the description of the bonding. This has been included by means
of CASPT2; see table 3. The result is a distance, r(Ni–N) = 2.03 Å, and a De = 0.65 eV
before BSSE correction and 0.48 eV after (CASPT2-A). It should be mentioned that the BSSE
was estimated using the same correction as used for CO. Since most of this error is due to the
Bonding of NH3, CO, and NO to NiO and Ni-doped MgO
S2505
description of the cluster, and considering that the distances of CO and NO from the surface
are not too different, a similar BSSE can be expected. The calculation of the vibrational shift,
ω = −101 cm−1, is also in line with the measured one, −71 cm−1; see table 3. Thus, the
bond strength is somewhat underestimated. This important point has been considered in more
detail by performinga calculation with a largerbasis set, CASPT2-B. In principle, the CASPT2
result can be systematically improved by increasing the size of the basis set and of the active
space. The results—table 3—show that the geometrical parameters and the binding energy
are reasonably converged with respect to the basis set. Here we applied a full counterpoise
correction to determine the BSSE-corrected value. This is 0.31 eV, i.e. slightly smaller than
the CASPT2-A result, and about 0.3 eV smaller than the experimental value. Therefore, we
can conclude that CASPT2 is able to provide a correct description of all the properties of the
NO/NiO bond.
Finally, we have performed single-point calculations for NO/NiMg8O9 using the MC-
CEPA approximation [20] on top of a CASSCF reference wavefunction. The BSSE was
corrected both at the CASSCF and at the MC-CEPA level. In addition to the basis set used
for the DFT and CASPT2 calculations, we have also employed a more extended one which
contains several semidiffuse polarization functions for a better description of dispersion effects
and a reduction of the BSSE. The results are also included in table 3. They show that the MC-
CEPA approach, as well as ACPF which is not documented here, yields only a very small
binding energy of 0.02 eV (0.24 eV without BSSE correction), even with the more ﬂexible
basis set. This is much less than obtained at the CASPT2 level and observed in experiment.
On the other hand, our CEPA-0 result, 0.34 eV (0.57 without BSSE correction), is rather close
to the corresponding result at the CASPT2 level, calculated for the same adsorption geometry.
Apparently, the two ways of describing the NO/NiO interaction by wavefunction-based
correlated ab initio methods differ substantially. At the CASPT2 level, a moderately strong
chemical bond is obtained and most of the calculated properties are in fair agreement with
experiment. The approximatecoupled-cluster(MC-CEPA) approach, on the other hand, yields
only a very small binding energy, much lower than the experimental value. (Several additional
MC-CEPA calculations with different cluster models,basis sets, and embeddings led to the very
same picture and resulted in binding energies of only 0.05–0.10 eV at equilibrium geometries
with rather long Ni–N distances of about 2.3–2.5 Å [53].) The question is still open of which
one of these two approaches is more reliable. It is well established that the CASPT2 method
very often leads to reasonable results because of error cancellations between an overestimation
of correlation effects and basis set deﬁciencies. By proceeding to extended basis sets, one
might obtain too large binding energies at the CASPT2 level; a recent example has been given
by Persson and Taylor [54]. MC-CEPA might slightly underestimate correlation effects, but
hardly so much that the calculated adsorption energy is too low by about 0.5 eV. Of course,
there are other effects, e.g. surface relaxation, which were not included in the present study
and which might also have some inﬂuence on the precise value for the adsorption energy: the
importance of triples and of the antiferromagnetic structure of NiO for the bonding between
NiO and the open-shell molecule NO has yet to be investigated.
4. Conclusions
The description of the bonding of NH3, CO, or NO to a Ni2+ cation embedded in an oxide matrix
(either MgO or NiO) represents a challenge to theory. DFT methods provide very different
answers, often qualitatively incorrect, depending on the exchange–correlationfunctional used,
reﬂecting the different natures of the bonding of NH3, CO, and NO to NiO. For NH3 and CO
the failure is connected in part to the well-known limitations of DFT for describing dispersion
S2506
G Pacchioni et al
forces; for NO the problem is related to the description of the on-site Coulomb repulsion
in the Ni 3d shell and to the multi-reference character of the ground state [49]. Explicitly
correlated methods give an acceptable, although not perfect, description of all the properties
of both systems. However, there are still rather large discrepancies between perturbational
and variational ways for taking care of correlation effects (CASPT2 versus MC-CEPA). This
shows the importance of quantum-chemical methods in combination with cluster models for
describing surface bonds of some kinds. In this respect, the recent development of density-
based embedding cluster approaches seems particularly important [55].
