This critical review shows the basis of photocatalytic water splitting and experimental points, and
surveys heterogeneous photocatalyst materials for water splitting into H2 and O2, and H2 or O2
evolution from an aqueous solution containing a sacriﬁcial reagent. Many oxides consisting of
metal cations with d0 and d10 conﬁgurations, metal (oxy)sulﬁde and metal (oxy)nitride
photocatalysts have been reported, especially during the latest decade. The fruitful photocatalyst
library gives important information on factors aﬀecting photocatalytic performances and design
of new materials. Photocatalytic water splitting and H2 evolution using abundant compounds as
electron donors are expected to contribute to construction of a clean and simple system for solar
hydrogen production, and a solution of global energy and environmental issues in the future (361
references).

Introduction
Energy and environmental issues at a global level are impor-
tant topics. It is indispensable to construct clean energy
systems in order to solve the issues. Hydrogen will play an
important role in the system because it is an ultimate clean
energy and it can be used in fuel cells. Moreover, hydrogen is
used in chemical industries. For example, a large amount of
hydrogen is consumed in industrial ammonia synthesis. At
present, hydrogen is mainly produced from fossil fuels such as
natural gas by steam reforming.
CH4 + H2O - CO + 3H2
(1)
CO + H2O - CO2 + H2
(2)
In this process, fossil fuels are consumed and CO2 is emitted.
Hydrogen has to be produced from water using natural
energies such as sunlight if one thinks of energy and environ-
mental issues. Therefore, achievement of solar hydrogen
production from water has been urged. There are several ways
for solar hydrogen production.
(i) Electrolysis of water using a solar cell, a hydroelectric
power generation, etc.
(ii) Reforming of biomass.
(iii) Photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical water splitting
(artiﬁcial photosynthesis).
The characteristic point of water splitting using a powdered
photocatalyst is the simplicity as shown in Fig. 1. Sun shines at
photocatalyst powders dispersed in a pool with water, and
then hydrogen is readily obtained. The necessity of separation
of H2 evolved from O2 is disadvantageous toward the photo-
catalytic water splitting process. However, the problem will be
able to be overcome using a Z-scheme photocatalyst system.

Moreover, powdered photocatalyst systems will be advanta-
geous for large-scale application of solar water splitting be-
cause of the simplicity. So, photocatalytic water splitting is an
attractive reaction and will contribute to an ultimate green
sustainable chemistry and solving energy and environmental
issues resulting in bringing an energy revolution.
The photon energy is converted to chemical energy accom-
panied with a largely positive change in the Gibbs free energy
through water splitting as shown in Fig. 2. This reaction is
similar to photosynthesis by green plants because these are
uphill reactions. Therefore, photocatalytic water splitting is
regarded as an artiﬁcial photosynthesis and is an attractive
and challenging theme in chemistry. From the viewpoint of the
Gibbs free energy change, photocatalytic water splitting is
distinguished from photocatalytic degradation reactions such
as photo-oxidation of organic compounds using oxygen mo-
lecules that are generally downhill reactions. This downhill-
type reaction is regarded as a photoinduced reaction and has
been extensively studied using TiO2 photocatalysts.1,2
The Honda–Fujishima eﬀect of water splitting using a TiO2
electrode was reported in the early 1970s. When TiO2 is
irradiated with UV light electrons and holes are generated as
shown in Fig. 3.3 The photogenerated electrons reduce water to
form H2 on a Pt counter electrode while holes oxidize water to
form O2 on the TiO2 electrode with some external bias by a
power supply or pH diﬀerence between a catholyte and an
anolyte. Numerous researchers had extensively studied water
splitting using semiconductor photoelectrodes and photocata-
lysts since the ﬁnding. However, eﬃcient materials for water
splitting into H2 and O2 under visible light irradiation had not
been found. Accordingly, the photon energy conversion by
water splitting using photocatalysts had been considered to be
pessimistic, and its research activity had been sluggish. However,
new photocatalyst materials for water splitting have recently
been discovered one after another. Although the photon energy
conversion using powdered photocatalysts is not at the stage of
practical use, the research in photocatalytic water splitting is
being advanced. The photocatalytic water splitting is still a
challenging reaction even if the research history is long.
Many reviews and books for photocatalytic water splitting
have been published.4–30 In the present review, we focus on
heterogeneous photocatalyst materials of metal oxides, metal
(oxy)sulﬁdes and metal (oxy)nitrides for water splitting into
H2 and O2 in stoichiometric amount, and H2 or O2 evolution
from an aqueous solution containing a sacriﬁcial reagent.
After the bases of photocatalytic water splitting are inter-
preted heterogeneous photocatalyst materials are surveyed.
Factors aﬀecting photocatalytic performances and strategies
of photocatalyst design are discussed through the general
viewpoint. Some applications of newly developed photocata-
lysts to other photocatalytic reactions such as degradation of
organic compounds are also introduced.

Bases of photocatalytic water splitting
2.1
Processes in photocatalytic water splitting
Fig. 4 shows the main processes in a photocatalytic reaction.
The ﬁrst step (i) is absorption of photons to form electron–
hole pairs. Many heterogeneous photocatalysts have semi-
conductor properties. Photocatalytic reactions proceed on
semiconductor materials as schematically shown in Fig. 5.
Semiconductors have a band structure in which the conduc-
tion band is separated from the valence band by a band gap

with a suitable width. When the energy of incident light is
larger than that of a band gap, electrons and holes are
generated in the conduction and valence bands, respectively.
The photogenerated electrons and holes cause redox reactions
similarly to electrolysis. Water molecules are reduced by the
electrons to form H2 and are oxidized by the holes to form O2
for overall water splitting. Important points in the semicon-
ductor photocatalyst materials are the width of the band gap
and levels of the conduction and valence bands. The bottom
level of the conduction band has to be more negative than the
redox potential of H+/H2 (0 V vs. NHE), while the top level of
the valence band be more positive than the redox potential of
O2/H2O (1.23 V). Therefore, the theoretical minimum band
gap for water splitting is 1.23 eV that corresponds to light of
about 1100 nm.
Band gap (eV) = 1240/l (nm)
(3)
Band levels of various semiconductor materials are shown in
Fig. 6. The band levels usually shift with a change in pH
(0.059 V/pH) for oxide materials.4,29,30 ZrO2, KTaO3,
SrTiO3 and TiO2 possess suitable band structures for water
splitting. These materials are active for water splitting when
they are suitably modiﬁed with co-catalysts. Although CdS
seems to have a suitable band position and a band gap with
visible light response it is not active for water splitting into H2
and O2. S2 in CdS rather than H2O is oxidized by photo-
generated holes accompanied with elution of Cd2+ according
to the eqn (4).30
CdS + 2h+ - Cd2+ + S
(4)
This reaction is called photocorrosion and is often a demerit
of
a
metal
sulﬁde
photocatalyst.
ZnO
is
also
photo-
corroded under band gap excitation even if it is an oxide
photocatalyst.
ZnO + 2h+ - Zn2+ + 1/2O2
(5)
However, CdS is an excellent photocatalyst for H2 evolution
under visible light irradiation if a hole scavenger exists as
mentioned in section 2.2. On the other hand, WO3 is a good
photocatalyst for O2 evolution under visible light irradiation
in the presence of an electron acceptor such as Ag+ and Fe3+
but is not active for H2 evolution because of its low conduction
band level. The band structure is just a thermodynamic
requirement but not a suﬃcient condition. The band gap of
a visible-light-driven photocatalyst should be narrower than
3.0 eV (l 4 415 nm). Therefore, suitable band engineering is
necessary for the design of photocatalysts with visible light
response as mentioned in section 7.1.1.
The second step (ii) in Fig. 4 consists of charge separation
and migration of photogenerated carriers. Crystal structure,
crystallinity and particle size strongly aﬀect the step as shown
in Fig. 7. The higher the crystalline quality is, the smaller the
amount of defects is. The defects operate as trapping and
recombination centers between photogenerated electrons and
holes, resulting in a decrease in the photocatalytic activity. If
the particle size becomes small, the distance that photogener-
ated electrons and holes have to migrate to reaction sites on
the surface becomes short and this results in a decrease in the
recombination probability.
The ﬁnal step (iii) in Fig. 4 involves the surface chemical
reactions.
The
important
points
for
this
step
are
surface character (active sites) and quantity (surface area).

thermodynamically suﬃcient potentials for water splitting,
they will have to recombine with each other if the active sites
for redox reactions do not exist on the surface. Co-catalysts
such as Pt, NiO and RuO2 are usually loaded to introduce
active sites for H2 evolution because the conduction band
levels of many oxide photocatalysts are not high enough to
reduce water to produce H2 without catalytic assistance.
Active sites for 4-electron oxidation of water are required
for O2 evolution. Co-catalysts are usually unnecessary for
oxide photocatalysts because the valence band is deep enough
to oxidize water to form O2 as mentioned in section 7.1.1. This
is the characteristic point of heterogeneous photocatalysts
being diﬀerent from homogeneous photocatalysts for which
O2 evolution with 4-electron oxidation of H2O is a challenging
reaction. Back reactions to form water by reactions between
evolved H2, O2, and intermediates easily proceed because of an
uphill reaction. Therefore, poor properties for the back reac-
tions are required for the surface of co-catalyst and photo-
catalyst.
Fig. 8 shows how the processes indicated in Fig. 4 are aﬀected
by conditions of a photocatalyst in the case of TiO2. The TiO2
photocatalyst is prepared by several methods. For example,
amorphous TiO2 that may be denoted as TiO2nH2O is ob-
tained by hydrolysis of titanium tetra-isopropoxide. When the
amorphous TiO2 is calcined some factors are simultaneously
changed. Anatase and rutile are obtained through phase transi-
tion. The band gap of anatase is 3.2 eV while that of rutile is
3.0 eV indicating that the crystal structure determines the band
gap even if the composition is the same. The diﬀerence in the
band gap between anatase and rutile is mainly due to the
diﬀerence in the conduction band level. The conduction
band level of anatase is higher than that of rutile leading
the diﬀerence in photocatalytic abilities between anatase and
rutile (brookite TiO2 is selectively prepared by a hydrothermal
method).31 Crystallinity is increased by calcination: that is a
positive factor as shown in Fig. 7. The crystallinity is conﬁrmed
from half-widths of peaks of XRD patterns and also observa-
tion by electron microscopes. On the other hand, the surface
area (as determined by BET measurement) is decreased with
an increase in particle size through sintering: that is a negative
factor. Small particle size sometimes gives a quantum size
eﬀect as seen in colloidal particles resulting in widening of
band gap and blue shift in the absorption spectrum. The
resultant photocatalytic activity is dominated by the balance
among these factors. A high degree of crystallinity is often
required rather than a high surface area for water splitting
because
recombination
between
photogenerated
electrons
and holes is especially a serious problem for uphill reactions.
In
contrast,
high
surface
area
is
necessary
for
photo-
catalytic degradation of organic compounds because adsorp-
tion of the organic compound is the important process.
Concentration of surface hydroxyl groups may also aﬀect
photocatalytic activity.32
Many photocatalysts are also materials for solar cells,
phosphors and dielectrics. However, the signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between the photocatalyst and the other materials is that
chemical reactions are involved in the photocatalytic process,
but not in the other physical properties. Only when three steps
shown in Fig. 4 are simultaneously completed photocatalytic
activities can be obtained. Thus, suitable bulk and surface
properties, and energy structure are required for photocata-
lysts. So, it is understandable that photocatalysts should be
highly functional materials.
2.2
Photocatalytic H2 or O2 evolution in sacriﬁcial systems
Sacriﬁcial reagents are often employed to evaluate the
photocatalytic activity for water splitting as shown in Fig. 9,
because overall water splitting is a tough reaction. When the
photocatalytic reaction is carried out in an aqueous solution
including a reducing reagent, in other words, electron donors
or hole scavengers, such as alcohol and a sulﬁde ion,
photogenerated holes irreversibly oxidize the reducing reagent
instead of water. It enriches electrons in a photocatalyst and
an H2 evolution reaction is enhanced as shown in Fig. 9(a).
This reaction will be meaningful for realistic hydrogen
production if biomass and abundant compounds in nature
and industries are used as the reducing reagents.33–38 On
the other hand, photogenerated electrons in the conduction
band are consumed by oxidizing reagents (electron acceptors
or electron scavengers) such as Ag+ and Fe3+ resulting in
that an O2 evolution reaction is enhanced as shown in
Fig. 9(b). These reactions using sacriﬁcial reagents are
studied to evaluate if a certain photocatalyst satisﬁes the
thermodynamic and kinetic potentials for H2 and O2 evolu-
tion. These reactions are regarded as half reactions of water
splitting and are often employed as test reactions of photo-
catalytic H2 or O2 evolution as mentioned in sections 6 and 7.

Even if a photocatalyst is active for these half reactions the
results do not guarantee a photocatalyst to be active for
overall water splitting into H2 and O2 in the absence of
sacriﬁcial reagents. From this point, the term of ‘‘water
splitting’’ should be distinguishably used for H2 or O2 evolu-
tion from aqueous solutions in the presence of sacriﬁcial
reagents. Water splitting means to split water into H2 and
O2 in a stoichiometric amount in the absence of sacriﬁcial
reagents.
3.
Experimental method for water splitting
3.1
Points that should be paid attention
The points that should be paid attention to evaluate photo-
catalytic water splitting are shown in Fig. 10.7
(i) Stoichiometry of H2 and O2 evolution. In water splitting,
both H2 and O2 should form with a stoichiometric amount,
2:1, in the absence of a sacriﬁcial reagent. Often H2 evolution
is observed with a lack of O2 evolution. In this case, the
amount of H2 evolution is usually small compared with an
amount of a photocatalyst. It is not clear if such a reaction is
photocatalytic water splitting and it is important to clarify that
it is not a sacriﬁcial reaction.
(ii) Time course. Amounts of H2 and O2 evolved should
increase with irradiation time. To check not only the value of
activity or a gas evolution rate but also the time course is
important. Repeated experiment is also informative.
(iii) Turnover number (TON). Amounts of H2 and O2 should
overwhelm an amount of a photocatalyst. If the amounts are
much less than the amount of photocatalyst we do not know if
the reaction proceeds photocatalytically because the reaction
might be due to some stoichiometric reactions. Turnover
number (TON) is usually deﬁned by the number of reacted
molecules to that of an active site (eqn (6)).
TON ¼ Number of reacted molecules
Number of active sites
ð6Þ
However, it is often diﬃcult to determine the number of active
sites for photocatalysts. Therefore, the number of reacted
electrons
to
the
number
of
atoms
in
a
photocatalyst
(eqn (7)) or on the surface of a photocatalyst (eqn (8)) is
employed as the TON.
TON ¼
Number of reacted electrons
Number of atoms in a photocatalyst
ð7Þ
TON ¼
Number of reacted electrons
Number of atoms at the surface of a photocatalyst
ð8Þ
The number of reacted electrons is calculated from the
amount of evolved H2. The TONs (7) and (8) are smaller than
the real TON (6) because the number of atoms is more than
that of active sites. Normalization of photocatalytic activity by
weight of used photocatalyst (for example, mmol h1 g1) is
not acceptable because the photocatalytic activity is not
usually proportional to the weight of photocatalyst if an
amount of photocatalyst is enough for a certain experimental
condition. The amount of photocatalyst should be optimized
for an each experimental setup. In this case, photocatalytic
activity usually depends on the number of photons absorbed
by a photocatalyst unless the light intensity is too strong.
(iv) Quantum yield. The rate of gas evolution is usually
indicated with a unit, for example mmol h1. Because the
photocatalytic activity depends on the experimental conditions
such as a light source and a type of a reaction cell, the activities
cannot be compared with each other if the reaction conditions
are diﬀerent from each other. Therefore, determination of a
quantum yield is important. The number of incident photons
can be measured using a thermopile or Si photodiode.
However, it is hard to determine the real amount of photons
absorbed by a photocatalyst in a dispersed system because of
scattering. So, the obtained quantum yield is an apparent
quantum yield (9). The apparent quantum yield is estimated
to be smaller than the real quantum yield because the number
of
absorbed
photons
is
usually
smaller
than
that
of
incident light.
AQY ð%Þ ¼ Number of reacted electrons
Bumber of incident photons  100
ð9Þ
It should be noteworthy that the quantum yield is diﬀerent
from the solar energy conversion eﬃciency that is usually used
for evaluation of solar cells.
Solar energy conversion ð%Þ
¼
Output energy as H2
Energy of incident solar light  100
ð10Þ
The number of photocatalysts that can give good solar energy
conversion eﬃciency is limited at the present stage because of
insuﬃcient activities for the measurement. However, the solar
energy conversion eﬃciency should ﬁnally be used to evaluate
the photocatalytic water splitting if solar hydrogen production
is considered.
(v) Photoresponse. When a photocatalyst is irradiated with
light of energy larger than the band gap, water splitting should
proceed. An action spectrum is indispensable to see the
photoresponse, especially for a photocatalyst with visible light
response (band-path and interference ﬁlters are usually

employed to obtain monochromatic light for the action spec-
trum measurement). Even if a material absorbs visible light it
does not always show a photocatalytic activity by the excita-
tion of the visible light absorption band. Cut-oﬀﬁlters are
sometimes used to see the photoresponse. In this case the onset
of the photoresponse can be measured. Water splitting by
mechanocatalysis proceeds on some metal oxides under stir-
ring and dark condition.8,39 Some control experiments such as
no photocatalysts or non-irradiation have to be carried out to
conﬁrm the photocatalytic reaction and neglect the possibility
of the mechanocatalytic water splitting.
There are many other points that researchers have to pay
attention. The details of experiments for general photo-
catalysis are described in the literature by Ohtani.40
3.2
Experimental setup
There are several types of apparatus for water splitting. The
present authors have usually used a gas-closed circulation
system equipped with a vacuum line, a reaction cell and a
gas sampling port that is directly connected to a gas chroma-
tograph as shown in Fig. 11. If a photocatalytic activity is
too high to use a gas chromatograph a volumetric method
is employed for determination of evolved gases. The apparatus
should be air-free because the detection of O2 is very impor-
tant for evaluation of photocatalytic water splitting. There
are several reaction cells. In general, eﬃcient irradiation is
conducted when an inner irradiation reaction cell is used.
A high-pressure mercury lamp is often used with a quartz
cell for photocatalysts with wide band gaps when intensive
UV light with wavelength shorter than about 300 nm is
especially needed. When visible light irradiation is necessary
a Xe-lamp with a cut-oﬀﬁlter is usually employed. It is
important to know the spectrum of the incident light. It
depends on a light source, a material of a reaction cell, an
optical ﬁlter, a mirror, etc. A solar simulator that is a standard
light source for evaluation of solar cells should ideally be used
if solar hydrogen production is considered. A solar simulator
with an air-mass 1.5 ﬁlter (AM-1.5) irradiates 100 mW cm2
of power.

General view of elements constructing
heterogeneous photocatalyst materials
Fig. 12 shows elements constructing heterogeneous photoca-
talyst materials. The elements are classiﬁed into four groups;
(i) to construct crystal structure and energy structure, (ii) to
construct crystal structure but not energy structure, (iii) to
form impurity levels as dopants and (iv) to be used as co-
catalysts.
Most metal oxide, sulﬁde and nitride photocatalysts consist
of metal cations with d0 and d10 conﬁgurations. Their con-
duction bands for the d0 and d10 metal oxide photocatalysts
are usually composed of d and sp orbitals, respectively, while
their valence bands consist of O 2p orbitals. Valence bands of
metal sulﬁde and nitride photocatalysts are usually composed
of S 3p and N 2p orbitals, respectively. Orbitals of Cu 3d in
Cu+, Ag 4d in Ag+, Pb 6s in Pb2+, Bi 6s in Bi3+, and Sn 5s in
Sn2+ can also form valence bands in some metal oxide and
sulﬁde photocatalysts as mentioned in sections 7.1.4 and 9.3.
Alkali, alkaline earth and some lanthanide ions do not
directly contribute to the band formation and simply construct
the crystal structure as A site cations in perovskite com-
pounds.
Some transition metal cations with partially ﬁlled d orbitals
such as Cr3+, Ni2+ and Rh3+ form some impurity levels in
band gaps when they are doped or substituted for native metal
cations. Although they often work as recombination centres
between photogenerated electrons and holes they sometimes
play an important role for visible light response as mentioned
in sections 7.1.3 and 9.2.
Some transition metals and the oxides such as noble metals
(Pt,41,42 Rh42,43 and Au44,45), NiO46 and RuO2
47,48 function as
co-catalysts for H2 evolution. In water splitting, a back reac-
tion to form water from evolved H2 and O2 has to be
suppressed because of an uphill reaction. Au, NiO and
RuO2 are suitable co-catalysts on which the back reaction
hardly proceeds. A Cr–Rh oxide has recently been found
as an excellent co-catalyst for H2 evolution by oxynitride
photocatalysts.49,50 IrO2 colloids works as an O2 evolution
co-catalyst.51–53

Wide band gap metal oxide photocatalysts
for water splitting under UV irradiation
5.1
Oxide photocatalysts consisting of d0 metal
cations42–43,45,46,54–151
Table 1 shows photocatalyst materials consisting of d0 metal
cations (Ti4+, Zr4+, Nb5+, Ta5+ and W6+) for water splitting
with reasonable activities. The activities are not directly
compared with each other because experimental conditions
such as light sources, reaction cells, and the scale of the
reaction are diﬀerent from each other. But the values of
activities would make sense as to how high the activities of
photocatalysts are.
Valence bands of these photocatalysts, except for AgTaO3,
consist of O 2p orbitals of which the potential is about 3 eV vs.
NHE while conduction band levels are more negative than
0 eV. It results in that these materials respond to only UV. An
Ag 4d orbital forms a valence band of AgTaO3 with a O 2p
orbital.125
These metal mixed oxides are usually prepared by a solid-
state reaction. Metal oxides and/or alkali and alkaline earth
carbonates of starting materials are calcined at high tempera-
ture in air.
A polymerizable complex method152 is sometimes used for
preparation of photocatalysts.68,74,80,111,112,134,143 This pre-
paration method gives ﬁne and well-crystalline powders with
a high surface area at relatively low calcination temperature
and short calcination time compared with a conventional solid
state method. The example of an Sr2Ta2O7 photocatalyst is
shown in Fig. 13.111 SrCO3 and TaCl5 are dissolved in an
ethylene glycol (EG) and methanol mixed solution containing
anhydrous citric acid (CA) of a chelating agent to stabilize
metal cations. The transparent colourless solution is heated at
403 K with stirring to promote polymerization between CA
and EG. The solution becomes more viscous with time, and a
brown resin-like gel is obtained without any visible precipita-
tion after several hours. The brown gel is heated at 723 K for
several hours to remove residual solvents and to burn out
unnecessary organics. The powder obtained is referred to as
powder precursors for Sr2Ta2O7. The powder precursor
is calcined at temperatures between 973 and 1273 K for
5–100 h in air. Some metal oxide photocatalysts that are
hardly prepared by solid-state reactions can be obtained by
the polymerizable complex method.143 Aqueous processes
such as hydrothermal synthesis31,131 are also employed for
the preparation of photocatalysts. Photocatalysts prepared by
these soft processes sometimes show higher activities than
those prepared by solid state reaction because they have small
particle size and good crystallinity. Next, let us see each
photocatalyst.
5.1.1
Group 4 elements42,43,46,54–97. TiO2 has extensively
been studied for a long time. Although water splitting was
ﬁrstly demonstrated using a TiO2 photoelectrode with some
external bias as shown in Fig. 3 a powdered TiO2 photo-
catalyst can not split water without any modiﬁcations such as
loading co-catalysts. At the initial stage of the research, it was
questionable that a platinized TiO2 photocatalyst could split
water because the activity was usually low and no O2 evolution
was often observed. After that, NaOH-coating43 and additions
of alkali carbonates55 have been found to be eﬀective for water
splitting on the Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst.
SrTiO3
29,153 and KTaO3
29,154 photoelectrodes with perovs-
kite structure can split water without an external bias being
diﬀerent from TiO2 because of their high conduction band
levels as shown in Fig. 6. These materials can be used as
powdered photocatalysts. Domen and co-workers have re-
ported that NiO-loaded SrTiO3 powder can decompose pure
water into H2 and O2.46,59–63 The NiO co-catalyst for H2
evolution is usually activated by H2 reduction and subsequent
O2 oxidation to form a NiO/Ni double layer structure that is
convenient for electron migration from a photocatalyst sub-
strate to a co-catalyst.61 The pretreated NiO co-catalyst is
often denoted as NiOx in literature. It is important that the
NiO co-catalyst does not cause the back reaction between H2
and O2, being diﬀerent from Pt. The excellent NiO co-catalyst
has often been employed for many photocatalysts for water
splitting as seen in Table 1. Rh is also a suitable co-catalyst for
the SrTiO3 photocatalyst.42
TiO2 and SrTiO3 photocatalysts are also active for reduc-
tion of NO3
 using water as an electron donor.155–157
K2La2Ti3O10 that possesses a layered perovskite structure is
a unique photocatalyst. H2 evolution proceeds on a pretreated
NiOx co-catalyst while O2 evolves at the hydrated interlayer.
Many titanate, niobate and tantalate photocatalysts with
layered perovskite structure have been reported since the
K2La2Ti3O10
photocatalyst
was
found.
Sr3Ti2O7
and
Sr4Ti3O10 photocatalysts have perovskite slabs of SrTiO3.
La2Ti2O7, La2Ti2O7:Ba, KLaZr0.3Ti0.7O4 and La4CaTi5O17
photocatalysts with layered perovskite structure give high
quantum yields.
Na2Ti6O13 and BaTi4O9 with tunnel structure are also
unique titanate photocatalysts. KTiNbO5 shows activity
when it is prepared by a polymerizable complex method.
Gd2Ti2O7 and Y2Ti2O7 with pyrochlore structure are also
active.
ZrO2 is active without co-catalyst because of its high con-
duction band level. This photocatalyst is also active for CO2
reduction to CO accompanied with O2 evolution by oxidation
of water without any sacriﬁcial reagents.93
5.1.2
Group
5
elements45,70,76,98–146.
K4Nb6O17
and
Rb4Nb6O17 with layered structure as seen in mica show high
activities. These photocatalysts possess two kinds of inter-
layers in which ion-exchangeable potassium cations exist as
shown in Fig. 14.100 H2 evolution proceeds in one interlayer
with a nickel co-catalyst while O2 evolution occurs in another
interlayer. It is the characteristic of the K4Nb6O17 photocata-
lyst that H2 evolution sites are separated from O2 evolution
sites by the photoactive niobate sheet.101 This photocatalyst is
active for water splitting and H2 evolution from an aqueous
methanol solution even without co-catalyst. Moreover, the
activity for the sacriﬁcial H2 evolution is much enhanced by
H+-exchange.99
Ca2Nb2O7,
Sr2Nb2O7
and
Ba5Nb4O15
with
layered
perovskite structure show high activity. NaCa2Nb3O10 and
KCa2Nb3O10 stacked with RuO2 colloids from exfoliated
nano-sheets are active for water splitting although the native

NaCa2Nb3O10 and KCa2Nb3O10 are active just for half reac-
tions in the presence of sacriﬁcial reagents.113
ZnNb2O6 photocatalyst with d10 and d0 metal ions produce
H2 and O2 from pure water.
Ta2O5 shows high activity. K3Ta3Si2O13 and K3Ta3Bi2O12
with pillared structure in which three linear chains of corner-
shared TaO6 are connected with each other are active for
water splitting without any co-catalyst.120,121 The activity of
K3Ta3Si2O13
drastically
increased with
loading
a
small
amount of a NiO co-catalyst while naked K3Ta3B2O12 shows
high activity. Alkali and alkaline earth tantalates show photo-
catalytic activities for water splitting into H2 and O2. These
tantalate photocatalysts are also active for reduction of NO3

to N2 using water as an electron donor.157
Ishihara and co-workers have reported that photocatalytic
activity of KTaO3 is improved by doping of Zr, Ti and Hf.
Moreover, modiﬁcation of the KTaO3:Zr photocatalyst by
some metal complexes such as vitamin B12 improves the
photocatalytic activity through a dye sensitized two-photon
process.158 On the other hand, many tantalates with layered
perovskite structure are also active. The photocatalytic
activity of K2LnTa5O15 with tungsten bronze structure
depends on Ln as well as RbLnTa2O7 with layered perovskite
structure.119,139
Among tantalates, NiO/NaTaO3 is highly active. The
photocatalytic activity of NiO/NaTaO3 increased remarkably
with doping of lanthanide ions.128,129 An optimized NiO
(0.2 wt%)/NaTaO3:La (2%) photocatalyst shows high activity
with an apparent quantum yield of 56% for water splitting.
The activity is stable for more than 400 h under irradiation of
light from a 400-W high pressure mercury lamp. Bubbles of H2
and O2 evolved can be observed when the photocatalyst is
irradiated with UV from a 200 W Xe–Hg lamp as shown in
Fig. 15. Only light, water and photocatalyst powder exist in

the system. It is amazing that reduction and oxidation of
water, completely opposite reactions, simultaneously proceed
on the same surface of a nano-particle. The NaTaO3:La
photocatalyst is also active for methane coupling.159
A series of A3MO3 (A = Bi, Al, Ga and In, M = Nb and
Ta) has been reported.160,161
5.1.3
Group 6 and other d0 elements147–151. PbWO4 with
scheelite structure and RbWMO6 (M = Nb and Ta) with
pyrochlore structure are active. The f-block metal oxide, CeO2
doped with Sr is active for water splitting, though nondoped
CeO2 is not active. The reasonable photocatalytic activity of
the CeO2:Sr is obtained using a quartz rather than a Pyrex cell
even though the absorption edge of the material is around
400 nm, suggesting that excitation at higher energy than the
minimum band gap excitation leads to the activity.150
5.2
Factors aﬀecting photocatalytic ability of d0 metal oxides
Many photocatalysts for water splitting have been found as
shown in Table 1. It is important to make such a photocatalyst
library because the relationship between the nature of materi-
als and the photocatalytic abilities can be considered. For
example, systematic comparison of photocatalytic activities
between niobates and tantalates with similar structure give
some information on factors that aﬀect photocatalytic ability
as mentioned below.
5.2.1
Eﬀect of conduction band level consisting of Nb 4d and
Ta 5d orbitals on photocatalytic performances109. Sr2Nb2O7
possesses a layered perovskite structure that is the same as
Sr2Ta2O7 though the distortion of the framework is slightly
diﬀerent as shown in Fig. 16.162,163 These crystal structures are
composed of NbO6 and TaO6 octahedra. Moreover, the ionic
radius of Nb5+ is almost the same as that of Ta5+. However,
the photocatalytic activity of Sr2Ta2O7 is higher than that of
Sr2Nb2O7 as shown in Table 1 even if the number of absorbed
photons of Sr2Ta2O7 should be smaller than that of Sr2Nb2O7
under the same experimental condition, because the band gap
of the former is wider than that of the latter. The diﬀerence in
photocatalytic activities between niobates and tantalates is
mainly due to the conduction band level. The conduction
band of Sr2Ta2O7 consists of Ta 5d while that of Sr2Nb2O7
is Nb 4d. The valence band potential of Sr2Ta2O7 should be
similar to that of Sr2Nb2O7 because the valence bands consist
of O 2p orbitals and six oxygen anions coordinate to Ta5+ or
Nb5+ with the same ionic radius. Eqn (11), as reported by
Scaife for oxides not containing metal cations with partly ﬁlled d
orbital can be applied to the present system for the approximate
determination of the ﬂat band potential,164 where Vfb and Eg
represent a ﬂat band potential and a band gap, respectively.
Vfb(NHE) = 2.94  Eg
(11)
The band structures of Sr2Ta2O7 and Sr2Nb2O7 can be
roughly described as shown in Fig. 17.109 Band structure of
NiO is also shown.165 O2 evolution on Sr2Ta2O7 is as easy as
that on Sr2Nb2O7 because the potentials of their valence bands
are deep enough to oxidize water into O2. Therefore, it is due
to the diﬀerence in the conduction band level that the

photocatalytic activity of Sr2Ta2O7 is higher than that of
Sr2Nb2O7. The high conduction band level causes the driving
force for reduction of water to form H2. The reason why
Sr2Ta2O7 is able to decompose pure water without co-catalysts
is also due to its high conduction band.
In general, pretreatment of H2 reduction and subsequent O2
oxidation is indispensable for obtaining high activities for
NiO-loaded photocatalysts as mentioned in section 5.1.1.
The pretreatment is indispensable for NiO/Sr2Nb2O7 as usual
whereas it is not for NiO/Sr2Ta2O7. In the case of the non-
treated NiO/Sr2Ta2O7 photocatalyst, it is possible that the
photogenerated electrons in a conduction band of Sr2Ta2O7
can transfer to a conduction band of NiO because of the
suitable potential diﬀerence as shown in Fig. 17. In contrast,
this appears to be diﬃcult for Sr2Nb2O7 because the potential
diﬀerence in the conduction band between Sr2Nb2O7 and NiO
is negligible. In such a case, pretreatment would be necessary
as well as in the case of NiO/SrTiO3. Therefore, the eﬀect of
the conduction band level dominates the photocatalytic activ-
ities of the Sr2M2O7 system. Systematic investigation of solid
solutions also gives some information on factors aﬀecting
photocatalytic activities.110,111
In this section, main factors were just discussed from the
viewpoint of band structure as shown in Fig. 5. The nature of
connection of MO6 octahedra in crystal structure should be
suitable for migration of photogenerated electrons and holes,
and surface reactions of the carriers with water as indicated by
steps (ii) and (iii) in Fig. 4 as mentioned in the next section.
5.2.2
Eﬀect of distortion of framework of crystal structure
on energy structure109,122. All of ATaO3 (A: Li, Na, and K)
consist of corner-sharing TaO6 octahedra with perovskite-like
structures as shown in Fig. 18.122 The photocatalytic activities
of ATaO3 depends on the A site cation of perovskite-like
structure. The bond angles of Ta–O–Ta are 1431 (LiTaO3),
1631 (NaTaO3) and 1801 (KTaO3) in octahedral connection.
Wiegel and co-workers have reported the relationship between
crystal structures and energy delocalization for alkali tanta-
lates ATaO3 (A: Li, Na, and K).166 As the bond angle
approaches 1801, excited energy or electron–hole pairs in the
crystal migrate more easily and the band gap becomes nar-
rower. Therefore, the order of the delocalization of excited
energy or electron–hole pairs is LiTaO3 o NaTaO3 o
KTaO3, while that of the band gap is reversed in the order.
The degree of localization aﬀects the step (ii) in Fig. 4. This
discussion is applied to other photocatalyst systems.109,125,167
NaTaO3 shows the highest photocatalytic activity among the
ATaO3 (A: Li, Na, and K) photocatalysts when a NiO
co-catalyst is loaded. In the case of NaTaO3, excess sodium
in the starting material is indispensable for showing the high
activity indicating that preparation conditions are impor-
tant.123 The conduction band level of the NaTaO3 photo-
catalyst is higher than that of NiO165 as shown in Fig. 19.122
Moreover, the excited energy is delocalized in the NaTaO3
crystal. Therefore, the photogenerated electrons in the con-
duction band of the NaTaO3 photocatalyst are able to transfer
to the conduction band of the NiO co-catalyst. Therefore,
NiO-loading is eﬀective for the NaTaO3 photocatalyst even
without special pretreatment as observed for a NiO/Sr2Ta2O7
photocatalyst. Thus, the high activity of NiO/NaTaO3 is due
to the suitable conduction band level consisting of Ta 5d and
energy delocalization caused by the small distortion of TaO6
connections.
Charge separation of photogenerated electrons and holes is
required in the case of a water splitting reaction into H2 and
O2 more strongly than in the case of photocatalytic reactions

in the presence of sacriﬁcial reagents in order to prevent
recombination. Sr2Nb2O7 has a dipole moment along perovs-
kite layers, the c axis, due to the distortion of the framework of
perovskite layers as shown in Fig. 16. The charge separation
may be enhanced by the dipole moment.109 Inoue has pro-
posed the eﬀects of local distortion of polyhedra consisting of
the crystal structure of photocatalysts on the charge separation.18
These factors aﬀect charge separation of the step (ii) in Fig. 4.
5.2.3
Eﬀect of morphology on creation of active sites128–130.
The photocatalytic activity of NiO/NaTaO3 increases remark-
ably with doping of La ions.128,129 The reaction scheme for the
water splitting on the NiO/NaTaO3:La photocatalyst is shown
in Fig. 20.129 The particle size of the NaTaO3:La crystal
(0.1–0.7 mm) is smaller than that of the nondoped NaTaO3
crystal (2–3 mm) and ordered surface nano-steps are created by
lanthanum doping. The small particle size with high crystal-
linity is advantageous in terms of increasing the probability of
the reactions of photogenerated electrons and holes with water
molecules, rather than recombination as shown in Fig. 7. The
H2 evolution site of the edge is eﬀectively separated from the
O2 evolution site of the groove at the surface nanostep
structure. This separation is advantageous, especially for
water splitting in order to avoid the back reaction. Doping
of Ca, Sr and Ba also gives the same eﬀect as the La doping on
the formation of the characteristic morphology of NaTaO3
and the improvement of photocatalytic activity.130 Thus, the
change in surface morphology aﬀects the step (iii) in Fig. 4.
Time-resolved IR measurements reveal that the La doping
prolongs the lifetime of photogenerated electrons in a conduc-
tion band or a shallow trap level as shown in Fig. 21.168 The
absorption is due to the electrons photogenerated by band gap
excitation at 266 nm. The increase in the lifetime is also one of
the factors for the improvement of photocatalytic ability. This
factor aﬀects the step (ii) in Fig. 4.
5.3
Oxide photocatalysts consisting of d10 metal cations169–180
d10 metal oxides such as ZnO and In2O3 are well-known
photocatalysts for a long time. However, they are not active
for water splitting because of photocorrosion according to
eqn (5) and the low conduction band level, respectively.7 In
contrast, Inoue’s group has found various mixed oxide photo-
catalysts consisting of d10 metal cations, Ga3+, In3+, Ge4+,
Sn4+ and Sb5+, for water splitting as shown in Table 2.

A RuO2 co-catalyst is indispensable for these photocatalysts
except for a Ga2O3 photocatalyst. The RuO2 co-catalyst is
loaded using Ru3(CO)12 by an impregnation method. Con-
duction bands of these photocatalysts consist of sp orbitals of
d10 metal cations. These bands are dispersed well resulting in
high mobility of photogenerated electrons. Inoue has pro-
posed that the dipole moment formed by distortions of MO4
tetrahedra and MO6 octahedra enhances charge separation of
photogenerated carriers.170,176,177 The CaIn2O4 photocatalyst
is also used for degradation of Methylene Blue.181–184 Sakata

Wide band gap metal oxide photocatalysts
for H2 or O2 evolution from an aqueous solution
containing a sacriﬁcial reagent under UV
irradiation185–197
Many metal oxide photocatalysts for water splitting without
any sacriﬁcial reagents have been developed as shown in
Tables 1 and 2. Therefore, it may appear meaningless to
develop wide band gap metal oxide photocatalysts not for
water splitting but for H2 or O2 evolution from an aqueous
solution containing a sacriﬁcial reagent under UV irradiation.
However, their development is still important to get informa-
tion on factors aﬀecting photocatalytic activity.
Table 3 shows wide band gap metal oxide photocatalysts
that are active for H2 or O2 evolution from an aqueous
solution containing a sacriﬁcial reagent under UV irradiation.
Many layered titanates are active for H2 evolution. H+-
exchange often gives higher activity for H2 evolution than
the native materials even in the absence of co-catalysts
such as Pt. It means that these protonated layered metal
oxides
possess
excellent
active
sites
for
H2
evolution.
K2Ti4O9 and HCa2Nb3O10 with SiO2 pillars at the interlayer
show high activities.188 These layered metal oxides are attrac-
tive materials for preparing nano-sheets. Sasaki’s group has
extensively studied nano-sheets of layered oxide materials,198
and the term ‘‘nano-sheet’’ was probably ﬁrst used by Sasaki’s
group. Titanate nano-sheets show photocatalytic activity for
self-cleaning. Osterloh and co-workers have reported photo-
catalytic reactions using Pt/HCa2Nb3O10 nano-sheets.199,200

Bi2W2O9, BaBi4Ti4O15 and Bi3TiNbO9 consisting of a
layered structure with perovskite slabs are active not only
for O2 but also H2 evolution in the presence of sacriﬁcial
reagent. Na2W4O13 photocatalyst with layered structure is
also active for H2 or O2 evolution from aqueous solutions in
the presence of sacriﬁcial reagents although WO3 is inactive
for H2 evolution. Homogeneous photocatalysts of tungsten-
polyacids are also active for H2 evolution.201
PbMoO4 with scheelite structure shows activities for H2 and
O2 evolution in the presence of sacriﬁcial reagents under UV
irradiation. The substituted compounds, Na0.5Bi0.5MoO4,
Ag0.5Bi0.5MoO4, Na0.5Bi0.5WO4 and Ag0.5Bi0.5WO4, are also
active for O2 evolution. In these photocatalysts, although these
molybdates and tungstates respond to only UV, Pb, Bi and Ag
play an important role for making the valence bands as
mentioned in section 7.1.4.
Solid solutions of b-Ga2O3 and In2O3 consisting of d10 cations
have been systematically studied for photocatalytic activities for
H2 or O2 evolution from aqueous solutions in the presence of
sacriﬁcial reagents.196 In this photocatalyst system, the band gap
and luminescent energy decrease as the ratio of indium increases.

Photocatalysts with visible light response for H2
or O2 evolution from an aqueous solution containing
a sacriﬁcial reagent
Development of photocatalysts that work only for half reac-
tions of water splitting in the presence of sacriﬁcial reagents
might seem meaningless but this view is incorrect. These
photocatalysts can be used to construct Z-scheme systems
that are active for water splitting under visible light irradiation
as mentioned in section 8.3. Moreover, some of them will be
able to produce H2 using biomass and abundant com-
pounds.33–38 Tables 4 and 5 list photocatalysts for H2 or O2

7.1.1
Design of oxide photocatalysts with visible light
response. Suitable band engineering is required in order to
develop new photocatalysts for water splitting under visible
light irradiation as shown in Fig. 22. In general, the conduc-
tion bands of stable oxide semiconductor photocatalysts are
composed of empty orbitals (LUMOs) of metal cations with d0
and d10 conﬁgurations. Although the valence band level
depends on crystal structure and bond character between
metal and oxygen, the level of the valence band consisting of
O 2p orbitals is usually ca. 3.0 eV.164 Accordingly, a new
valence band or an electron donor level (DL) must be formed
with orbitals of elements other than O 2p to make the band
gap (BG) or the energy gap (EG) narrower because the
conduction band level should not be lowered. Not only the
thermodynamic potential but also kinetic ability for 4-electron
oxidation of water are required for the newly formed valence
band. Strategies for the band engineering are shown in Fig. 23.
The electron donor level is created above a valence band by

doping some elements into conventional photocatalysts with
wide band gaps such as TiO2 and SrTiO3. It results in the
formation of energy gap. On the other hand, some metal cations
and anions can contribute to valence band formations above
the valence band consisting of O 2p orbitals. Here, band gap is
distinguished from energy gap. The energy gap is formed by the
impurity level that does not form a complete band. Making a
solid solution is also a useful band engineering procedure. Such
band engineering is related to the step (i) in Fig. 4.
Oxide photocatalysts for H2 or O2 evolution from aqueous
solutions in the presence of sacriﬁcial reagents under visible

Native visible-light driven photocatalysts193,202–208.
WO3 is one of the most well known photocatalysts with visible
light response for O2 evolution in the presence of sacriﬁcial
reagents such as Ag+ and Fe3+. Abe and co-workers recently
found that Pt/WO3 is active for degradation of acetic acid,
CH3CHO and IPA under visible light irradiation.232
Bi2WO6
and
Bi2MoO6
with
the
Aurivillius
structure
are active for an O2 evolution reaction under visible light
irradiation. These tungstate and molybdate photocatalysts are
not active for H2 evolution because of the low conduction
band level. These photocatalysts are also used for degradation
of

Doped photocatalysts209–217. Doping has often been
attempted
to
prepare
visible
light-driven
photocatalysts
(Fig. 23(a)). Here, doping often means replacement with a
foreign element at a crystal lattice point of the host material.
A TiO2 photocatalyst is usually employed as a host material
for the doping. However, although the white powder becomes
colored with doping of transition metal cations, in general, the
photocatalytic activity drastically decreases because of forma-
tion of recombination centres between photogenerated elec-
trons and holes, even under band gap excitation. However,
doping of transition metals is a good strategy to develop
visible light responsive photocatalysts if a suitable dopant is
chosen as mentioned below.
Co-doping of Cr3+/Ta5+, Cr3+/Sb5+, Ni2+/Ta5+ and
doping of Rh cations is eﬀective in sensitization of SrTiO3 to
visible light. These doped SrTiO3 powders with Pt co-catalysts
show photocatalytic activities for H2 evolution from aqueous
methanol solutions under visible light irradiation. Cr and Fe
are eﬀective dopants for H2 evolution over a La2Ti2O7 photo-
catalyst. Rh-doped SrTiO3 is one of the rare oxide photo-
catalysts that can eﬃciently produce H2 under visible light
irradiation. This Rh doping is also eﬀective for CaTiO3. The
SrTiO3:Rh photocatalyst plays an important role on a
Z-scheme photocatalyst system for water splitting under visi-
ble light irradiation as mentioned in section 8.3. On the other
hand, TiO2 (rutile) co-doped with Cr3+/Sb5+, Rh3+/Sb5+
and Ni2+/Nb5+ is active for O2 evolution from aqueous
silver nitrate solutions. In these doped photocatalysts, the
dopants form electron donor levels in the band gap of the
TiO2 and SrTiO3 host materials, resulting in visible light
response. When Ti4+ is replaced with Cr3+ or Ni2+, the
charge becomes unbalanced. This may result in the formation
of recombination centres. Co-doped metal cations such as
Nb5+, Ta5+ and Sb5+ compensate the charge imbalance,
resulting
in
the
suppression
of
the
formation
of
the

recombination centres and maintaining the property of visible
light absorption. When about 1% of Cr was doped into TiO2
without
any
co-dopant,
activities
were
never
obtained
as a rule. Thus, transition metal doping into photocatalysts
with wide band gaps is eﬀective for the development of visible
light responsive photocatalysts if a suitable combination of
dopant–co-dopant is chosen. Next, the co-doping eﬀect is
discussed using the TiO2:Rh/Sb and TiO2:Cr/Sb photo-
catalysts in more detail.
Fig. 24 shows dependence of photocatalytic O2 evolution
from an aqueous silver nitrate solution on TiO2:Rh/Sb upon
the ratio of doped Sb to Rh.216 When only Rh is doped into
TiO2 no activity is obtained and the colour of the photo-
catalyst is black. When the ratio of Sb/Rh is equal to or larger
than the unity O2 evolution activity is observed accompanied
with a colour change from black to orange. TiO2:Rh without
co-doping of Sb contains Rh4+ because Rh is doped at a Ti4+
site. The Rh4+ species predominantly works as a recombina-
tion site. As the ratio of co-doped Sb increases, the formation
of Rh4+ is suppressed. Co-doping with Sb5+ produces Rh3+
forming an electron donor level, due to keeping of the charge
balance, and results in showing of photocatalytic activities.
The same dependency is observed for a TiO2:Cr/Sb photo-
catalyst in which formation of Cr6+ is suppressed by the
Sb5+ co-doping.209 It is conﬁrmed by IR transient absorption
spectroscopy for the TiO2:Cr/Sb photocatalyst that the
Sb5+
co-doping
prolongs
a
lifetime
of
photogenerated
electrons as shown in Fig. 25.251 TiO2:Cr/Sb with 1.0–2.0 of
optimum ratios gives slowest decay when it is excited by
532 nm. It is interesting that the lifetime of photogenerated
electrons for the optimized TiO2:Cr/Sb is longer than that
for nondoped TiO2 even by the band gap excitation. The decay
is too fast to measure in this time scale by pumping of both
wavelengths for inactive TiO2:Cr/Sb with smaller ratios than
unity. The visible light responses are due to the transitions
from electron donor levels consisting of Rh3+ and Cr3+ to
the conduction band of the TiO2 host. The TiO2:Rh/Sb
and TiO2:Cr/Sb photocatalysts can use visible light up
to 600 nm, of relatively long wavelength for O2 evolution
photocatalysts.
PbMoO4 shows activities for H2 and O2 evolution in the
presence of sacriﬁcial reagents under UV irradiation as shown
in Table 3. When Cr6+ is partly replaced for Mo6+ in this host
material Cr6+ forms an electron acceptor level resulting in a
visible light response.217 DFT calculation revealed that this
visible light response is due to the transition from the valence
band consisting of Pb 6s and O 2p to the electron acceptor
level composed of Cr 3d empty orbitals. Formation of such an
acceptor level is also useful for sensitization of wide band gap
photocatalysts to visible light if the potential for H2 evolution
is not required.
Anion doping such as nitrogen to a TiO2 photocatalyst has
been studied for oxidation of organic compounds.250
7.1.4
Valence band-controlled photocatalysts218–231. In the
doped photocatalysts mentioned above, the formation of
recombination sites by the dopant is more or less inevitable.
Moreover, the level formed by the dopant is usually discrete
and thus inconvenient for the migration of holes formed there.
Therefore, the formation of a valence band by orbitals not
associated with O 2p but with other elements is indispensable
for oxide photocatalysts in order to design visible light-driven
photocatalysts (Fig. 23(b)).
Orbitals of Pb 6s in Pb2+, Bi 6s in Bi3+, Sn 5s in Sn2+ and
Ag 4d in Ag+ can form valence bands above the valence band

consisting of O 2p orbitals in metal oxide photocatalysts. The
degree of the contribution of these metal cations to the valence
band formation depends on the crystal structure and the ratio
of the metal cations contained.
RbPb2Nb3O10 and PbBi2Nb2O9 with layered perovskite
structure show activity for H2 or O2 evolution.
BiVO4 with a monoclinic scheelite structure shows photo-
catalytic activities for O2 evolution from aqueous silver nitrate
solutions under visible light irradiation. BiVO4 can be pre-
pared
by
an
aqueous
process
at
ambient
temperature
and pressure222,223 in an environmentally friendly process.
The
photocatalytic
activity
of
BiVO4
prepared
by
the
aqueous process is much higher than that of BiVO4 prepared
by a conventional solid state reaction. The diﬀerence in
the photocatalytic activity between BiVO4 obtained by the
diﬀerent methods is due to the crystallinity and defects. The
aqueous process is especially advantageous for the preparation
of materials in which defects are easily formed by volatiliza-
tion at high temperature calcination. The valence band
formation by Bi 6s orbitals is conﬁrmed by the band structure
and density of states obtained by DFT calculation as shown
in Fig. 26. The conduction band is composed of V 3d
as
in
other
d0
oxide
photocatalysts.
Although
BiVO4
does not show activity for H2 evolution due to the low
conduction level, it is noteworthy that the valence band
formed with Bi 6s orbitals possesses the potential for water
oxidation to form O2 accompanied by 4-electron oxidation.
BiVO4 is also used for the decomposition of endocrine dis-
ruptors such as nonylphenol252 and degradation of Methylene
Blue,253,254 Methyl Orange,255–258 Rhodamine B,259,260 4-n-alkyl-
phenol,261,262 4-n-nonylphenol,261,262 aromatic hydrocarbons,263
and benzopyrene.264 OH radicals that are often an active
species for photocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds
are not involved with the degradation in the case of the BiVO4
photocatalyst.265
SnNb2O6 shows activity for H2 or O2 evolution when
suitable co-catalysts are loaded. Especially, IrO2/SnNb2O6
shows relatively high activity for O2 evolution.229 Although
SnNb2O6 is active for half reactions of water splitting under
visible light irradiation overall water splitting is as yet not
successful. Sn 5s orbitals in Sn2+ form a valence band as seen
in SnNb2O6 while Sn 5s5p orbitals in Sn4+ form a conduction
band as observed for Sr2SnO4 (Table 2).
AgNbO3 with a perovskite structure and Ag3VO4 are active
for O2 evolution. AgLi1/3Ti2/3O2 and AgLi1/3Sn2/3O2 with
delafossite structure are synthesized by treating layered
compounds
Li2TiO3
and
Li2SnO3
with
molten
AgNO3
through ion exchange of Li+ for Ag+ and show activities
for O2 evolution from an aqueous silver nitrate solution
under visible light irradiation. The visible light responses of
AgNbO3, AgLi1/3Ti2/3O2 and AgLi1/3Sn2/3O2 are due to the
band gap excitation between conduction bands consisting
of either Nb 4d or Ti 3d or Sn 5s5p orbitals and valence
bands consisting of Ag 4d orbitals.125,231 AgNbO3 is also
active for the decomposition of endocrine disruptors such as
nonylphenol.266 Moreover, band engineering using the Ag 4d
orbital is applied to develop solid solution photocatalysts of
AgNbO3–SrTiO3 for degradations of 2-propanol267,268 and
CH3CHO.269
7.1.5
Oxide photocatalysts with visible light response by
sensitization270–279. Photocatalytic reactions under visible light
irradiation by sensitization of wide band gap semiconductor
photocatalysts have been studied as shown in Table 5. TiO2
and K4Nb6O17 loaded with various metal complexes and dyes
respond to visible light for H2 evolution according to a scheme
as shown in Fig. 27. After an electron is excited from the
HOMO to LUMO of a dye by visible light the electron is
injected to a conduction band. H2 evolves on the wide
band gap photocatalyst. This sensitization is applied to a
Ru(bpy)3
2+/K4Nb6O17 thin ﬁlm electrode that gives a photo-
current responding to visible light.280 Layered metal oxide
photocatalysts intercalated with CdS are also active for H2
evolution in the presence of sacriﬁcial reagents. The layered
metal oxides serve as H2 evolution sites.

(Oxy)nitride and oxysulﬁde photocatalysts281–296
Domen and co-workers have reported (oxy)nitrides and oxy-
sulﬁdes as new types of visible light-driven photocatalysts as
shown in Table 6. The valence bands of these photocatalysts
consist of N 2p and S 3p orbitals, in addition to O 2p, resulting
in the formation of narrow band gaps. These materials can
utilize up to 500–600 nm visible light.
Oxynitride photocatalysts consisting of metal cations of
Ti4+, Nb5+ and Ta5+ with d0 conﬁguration are active for
H2 or O2 evolution in the presence of sacriﬁcial reagents.
TaON and Ta3N5 give high quantum yields for O2 evolution.

However, they are not active for water splitting into H2 and O2
without sacriﬁcial reagents at the present stage. These materi-
als can also be applied to photoelectrochemical cells.297–299
Although metal sulﬁdes such as CdS cannot evolve O2 because
of photocorrosion, Sm2Ti2O5S2, an oxysulﬁde with layered
perovskite structure is active for the O2 evolution.

Photocatalyst systems for water splitting under
visible light irradiation
There are two types of photocatalyst systems for water split-
ting under visible light irradiation as shown in Fig. 28. Band
engineering is indispensable to develop the single photo-
catalyst system as shown in Fig. 22. Some oxynitride
photocatalysts are active for water splitting as mentioned in
the next section. Two-photon systems, as seen in photosynthesis
by green plants (Z-scheme), is another way to achieve
overall water splitting as mentioned in section 8.3. The
Z-scheme is composed of an H2-evolution photocatalyst, an
O2-evolution photocatalyst, and an electron mediator. Photo-
catalysts that are active only for half reactions of water
splitting as shown in Fig. 9 can be employed for the construc-
tion of the Z scheme: that is the merit of the Z scheme. Some
photocatalysts listed in Table 4 are actually used for Z-scheme
systems.
8.1
d10 metal nitrides300–312
Nitrides consisting of d10 metal cations are active for water
splitting as shown in Table 7, in contrast to d0 metal (oxy)ni-
trides. Ge3N4 shows activity under UV irradiation. This is the
ﬁrst example of a non-oxide powdered photocatalyst for
water splitting.300 GaN is the well known semiconductor that
is used for a blue light emitting diode.313 Native GaN powder is
not active whereas GaN loaded with Rh2xCrxO3 co-catalyst
and
Mg-doped
GaN
powders
are
active
under
UV irradiation. In contrast, GaN:ZnO solid solutions are active
under
visible
light
irradiation.
The
solid
solutions
are prepared by NH3-treatment of a mixture of Ga2O3 and
ZnO at 1123–1223 K for 5–30 h. Although native GaN
and ZnO possess only UV absorption bands, the solid solutions
have visible light absorption bands depending on the composi-
tion as shown in Fig. 29.307 The visible light absorption is due to
a Zn-related acceptor level and/or p–d repulsion between Zn 3d
and N 2p + O 2p in addition to the contribution of N 2p to
valence band formation.312,314,315 Optimized GaN:ZnO with
Rh2xCrxO3 co-catalyst gives 5.9% of quantum yield.311
Ge3N4:ZnO is also active under visible light irradiation.

Z-Scheme systems (two-photon process)319–325
Table 8 summarizes Z-scheme systems that work under visible
light irradiation. Combined systems with Fe ion-WO3,326
Pt/TiO2(anatase)–TiO2(rutile)–IO3
/I321,327
and
Pt/TiO2-
(anatase)–Pt/WO3–IO3
/I321 are active for water splitting
through a two-photon process under UV irradiation because
an iron ion and TiO2 respond to only UV. Combined systems
with Pt/SrTiO3:Cr/Ta for the H2 evolution photocatalyst and
Pt/WO3 for the O2 evolution photocatalyst can split water into
H2 and O2 in stoichiometric amounts under visible light
irradiation in the presence of an IO3
/I redox couple.
Oxynitride photocatalysts, TaON, CaTa2O2N and BaTa2O2N
can be used as H2 evolution photocatalysts with a Pt/WO3 of
O2 evolution photocatalyst. These photocatalyst systems re-
spond to about 450-nm light, which is limited by the band gap
of WO3. The system of Pt/TaON with RuO2/TaON is a unique
combination and is active up to 500 nm. The Z-scheme system
consisting of Pt/SrTiO3:Rh and BiVO4 or Bi2MoO6 is also
active in the presence of an Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple. The
system of Pt/SrTiO3:Rh and BiVO4 responds to 520-nm light,
which corresponds to the energy and band gaps of SrTiO3:Rh
and BiVO4 as shown in Fig. 30. Although the eﬃciency is low,
solar hydrogen production from water has been accomplished
using the Z-scheme system with powdered photocatalysts as
shown in Fig. 31. It is a simple system: the sun is allowed to
shine on the powders dispersed in aqueous solutions of iron
ions and Co complexes which causes water splitting to form
H2 and O2.

Metal sulﬁde photocatalysts with visible light
response for H2 evolution from an aqueous solution
containing a sacriﬁcial reagent328–349
Metal sulﬁdes are attractive materials as candidates of visible-
light-driven photocatalysts. The valence band usually consists
of S 3p orbitals the level of which is more negative than O 2p
as shown in Fig. 22. Although instability is a drawback of
metal sulﬁde photocatalysts the photocorrosion is suppressed
by hole scavenger such as S2 and SO3
2.
Many metal sulﬁde photocatalysts have been reported for
H2 evolution in the presence of sacriﬁcial reagents as shown in
Table 9.
9.1
Native visible-light driven photocatalysts328–339
CdS with a 2.4 eV-band gap is a well known metal sulﬁde
photocatalyst that can produce H2 under visible light irradiation
in the presence of a sacriﬁcial reagent.328–331 CdS has been
studied for a long time. ZnS with 3.6 eV-band gap is also a
well-known photocatalyst for H2 evolution though it responds to
only UV. It shows high activity without any assistance of co-
catalysts such as Pt. Therefore, ZnS is an attractive host photo-
catalyst for doping and preparing solid solutions as mentioned
below. Photocatalytic H2 evolution on CuInS2, CuIn5S8, Ag-
GaS2 and AgIn5S8 has been reported in the presence of sacriﬁcial
reagents. These metal sulﬁdes consist of elements of groups 11
and 13. NaInS2 with layered structure and ZnIn2S4 with spinel
structure are active. Feng and co-workers have reported unique
photocatalysts of indium sulﬁde compounds with open-frame-
work structure.338,339
9.2
Doped photocatalysts330,340–342
Fig. 32 shows diﬀuse reﬂection spectra of ZnS doped with
various metal cations. Visible light absorption band tails are
observed in addition to the band gap absorption band of the
ZnS host. These spectra have typical shapes of doped photo-
catalysts being diﬀerent from those of band gap transitions.
These metal cation-doped ZnS photocatalysts show activities
for H2 evolution from aqueous solutions containing S2 and/
or SO3
2 as electron donors. Loading of co-catalysts such as
Pt is not necessary for the H2 evolution, indicating that the
high conduction band of the ZnS host is maintained after the
doping of metal cations. Ag doping is also eﬀective for a CdS
photocatalyst.
9.3
Solid solution photocatalysts330–332,343–348
CdS and ZnS possess the same crystal structure indicating that
they can form solid solutions. The CdS–ZnS solid solution is
active for H2 evolution.
Solid solutions of AgInS2–ZnS, CuInS2–ZnS and CuInS2–
AgInS2–ZnS that are designed according to the strategy as
shown in Fig. 23(c) show high photocatalytic activities for H2
evolution from aqueous sulﬁde and sulﬁte solutions under

visible light irradiation. A solid solution photocatalyst of
AgGa0.9In0.1S2 is also active. The solid solution formation is
usually conﬁrmed by X-ray diﬀraction. Peaks of XRD shift
with the composition of the solid solution according to the
diﬀerence in ionic radii between metal cations. The diﬀuse
reﬂectance spectra of AgInS2–CuInS2–ZnS solid solutions
shift monotonically with the composition of the solid solution
as shown in Fig. 33. DFT calculation indicates that the levels
of the conduction band consisting of Zn 4s4p and In 5s5p, and
of the valence band consisting of Cu 3d, Ag 4d and S 3p, shift
with
the
varying
composition.
Ru/Cu0.25Ag0.25In0.5ZnS2
shows an excellent activity for H2 evolution with a solar
simulator (AM-1.5). These sulﬁde solid solution photocata-
lysts can utilize visible light of wavelengths up to about 700 nm.
Moreover, solid solutions of AgInS2-CuInS2 are black photo-
catalysts with about 1.5 eV band gap for H2 evolution. The
black photocatalysts can utilize near-infrared radiation up to
820 nm. The authors have demonstrated solar hydrogen
products from an aqueous Na2S + K2SO3 solution using
the AgInS2–CuInS2–ZnS solid solution photocatalyst and a
reactor of 1 m2. H2 evolution at a rate of about 2 L/m2 h was
observed in November in Tokyo. This photocatalytic H2
evolution will be important if abundant sulfur compounds in
chemical industries or nature can be used as electron donors as
shown in Fig. 34. Ideally, this reaction produces H2 at ambient
temperature and pressure but does not consume fossil fuels
and does not emit CO2. It should be noted that the photo-
catalytic H2 evolution is not a solar energy conversion because
the change in the Gibbs free energy is not so positive. Toji’s
group have studied CdS and ZnS photocatalysts with shell
structure in the presence of an electron donor aiming at solar
hydrogen production.350
AgInS2–ZnS and CuInS2–ZnS solid solution materials are
applied to unique luminescent materials of which emission
wavelengths are tuneable with the ratio of the solid solu-
tions.351–353

Conclusions
Energy and environment issues are discussed in litera-
ture.354–359 Solar water splitting including photocatalytic pro-
cesses is focused on as a candidate of the science and
technology for solving the issues in the future.354,358,359 The
number of photocatalysts for water splitting was very limited
about twenty years ago. Furthermore, the only well-known
visible light driven photocatalysts were CdS and WO3 for H2
and O2 evolution, respectively, even in the presence of sacri-
ﬁcial reagents. Now, many photocatalyst materials have been
developed as introduced in the present review paper. So, we
are sure that this research area is progressing. For example, a
highly eﬃcient water splitting was achieved using a powdered
photocatalyst of NiO/NaTaO3:La under UV irradiation. The
ﬁnding has proven that highly eﬃcient water splitting is
actually possible using powered photocatalysts. New pow-
dered
photocatalyst
systems
of
oxynitrides
such
as
CrxRh2xO3/GaN:ZnO and Z-scheme systems such as Ru/
SrTiO3:Rh-BiVO4 have been developed for overall water
splitting under visible light irradiation after about 35 years
from the report of the Honda–Fujishima eﬀect. Solar water
splitting is conﬁrmed using the Ru/SrTiO3:Rh–BiVO4 photo-
catalyst system. Moreover, in the presence of sulfur com-
pounds
as
electron
donors,
the
sulﬁde
solid
solution
photocatalysts AgInS2–CuInS2–ZnS are highly active for H2
evolution under solar light irradiation. H2 is thus realistically
obtained under sunlight irradiation. Thus, the library of
photocatalyst materials has become plentiful. The photo-
catalyst library will give information on factors aﬀecting

photocatalytic abilities and the further development of new
photocatalysts. The science for understanding photocatalytic
processes is also developed.40,168,251,360,361
The target for eﬃciency for water splitting into H2 and O2 is
30% in terms of a quantum yield at 600 nm in this research
ﬁeld. This eﬃciency gives about 5% of solar energy conver-
sion. The CrxRh2xO3/GaN:ZnO and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh-BiVO4
photocatalysts respond to about 500 nm for overall water
splitting so approaching this target but the quantum yield is
still low. So, surveying photocatalyst materials are still im-
portant. It will be also important to construct the operating
system for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Such an
achievement will contribute to global energy and environmen-
tal issues in the future resulting in bringing about an energy
revolution.
