Abstract: Lithium-promoted magnesium oxide was used as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen 
in a conventional flow reactor. Ethane and ethylene (C, compounds) were obtained with 50% selectivity at a 38% conversion 
of CHI over 4 g of 7 wt % Li-promoted MgO at 720 O C .  The initial reactant mixture had a CH, to O2 
ratio of ca. two. The 
other products were CO and CO,. In this reaction system both the C, selectivity and the CH, conversion increased with an 
increase in reaction temperature up to ca. 700 OC. 
All catalysts doped with 1 to 26 wt % Li were effective in the C2 
production, 
while undoped and 0.2 wt % Li-promoted MgO caused nonselective oxidation. EPR spectroscopy revealed that [Li'O-] centers 
probably were the active sites responsible for initiating the reaction by abstracting a hydrogen atom from CH,. The [Li'O-] 
centers exist in an equilibrium state only at high temperatures in the presence of oxygen. Based on kinetic analyses a mechanism 
has been proposed in which most of the products, including CO and CO,, are produced via CH,.; the coupling of two CH3. 
leads to C2H,, which is partly oxidized to C2H4. Below 700 "C CO and CO, are produced by reactions of CH3. with either 
surface 0,- ions or gaseous 0,. The latter reaction leads to chain reactions in which additional methyl radicals are generated. 
The Li-promoted MgO contains no transition metals; thus it is a new type of oxidation catalyst on which thermally generated 
0- 
ions activate methane. 
Methane, which is abundant as the main component of natural 
gas, also may be produced by the hydrogenation of carbon, carbon 
monoxide, or carbon dioxide. High molecular stability, however, 
makes it difficult to convert CH4 
into other useful chemicals. The 
partial oxidation of methane into more reactive chemicals such 
as methanol, ethylene, and other aliphatics is a current problem 
of great significance in heterogeneous catalysis. In 
general, it has 
not been possible to achieve both high conversions of CH, and 
good selectivities for the partial oxidation products.*-' 
Work in our laboratory has demonstrated that on MgO surfaces 
0- 
ions, formed from N,O, react readily with simple alkanes by 
abstracting a hydrogen atom at room t e m p e r a t ~ r e . ~ , ~  
These 
results parallel those of gas-phase studies involving 0- 
and al- 
kanes.I0 On the surface the resulting alkyl radicals react with 
surface 02- 
ions to produce further oxidized products. Although 
these reactions were carried out in a stoichiometric rather than 
a catalytic manner, we may expect that 0- 
is an important in- 
termediate in the partial oxidation of alkanes. Using molybdenum 
supported on silica, Lipatkina et al." also investigated the stoi- 
chiometric reaction of 0- 
with CH4 
and confirmed the formation 
of CH3. radicals. 
Recent results from our laborat~ry'~-'~ 
have demonstrated that 
alkyl radicals, formed by the reaction between surface 0- 
ions 
and alkanes over Mo/Si02 catalyst, are part of a catalytic cycle

in the partial oxidation of CH, and C,H6. During the oxidation 
of CHI, formaldehyde and methanol were the main partial oxi- 
dation products, although the selectivity was high only at relatively 
low conversion~.l~~'~ 
Ethylene and acetaldehyde were the principal 
products during the partial oxidation of ethane.I2J3 These catalytic 
systems, however, have limited utility since the results were 
achieved with N 2 0  
as the oxidant. 
In the present paper we report on the selective conversion of 
methane to ethylene and ethane at relatively high conversions, 
using O2 
as the oxidant. The C2H4 and C2H6 are produced by 
the formation and coupling of methyl radicals over a Li-promoted 
MgO catalyst. Kinetic and spectroscopic data provide evidence 
for the role of [Li'O-] centers in the generation of methyl radicals. 
Experimental Section 
Catalytic Experiments The Li-promoted MgO catalysts (Li/MgO) 
were prepared by adding Aldrich MgO (Gold Label, >99.999%) and 
Fisher Li,CO, (Certified ACS, >99.0%) to deionized water and evapo- 
rating the water, while stirring, until only a thick paste remained. The 
paste was dried at 140 O
C
 for more than 5 h. The Li,CO,/Mg(OH), 
thus obtained was then converted to the Li-promoted MgO at 465 "C 
(see below). By this method six catalysts promoted with 0.2, 1, 3, 7, 14, 
and 26 wt % Li were prepared (the weight percentage is defined as ratio 
of Li to sum of Li plus MgO). An unpromoted MgO catalyst was 
prepared in the same manner, except for the addition of Li,C03. Cat- 
alysts of 20-40 mesh and having an apparent density of ca. 0.4 g mL-' 
were used to obtain the kinetic data. In other experiments an unsieved 
powder was used. The methane (>99.97%), oxygen (>99.6%), nitrous 
oxide (>99.01), and ethane (>99.0%) were obtained from Matheson 
Gas. No further purification was attempted. 
The catalytic experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor 
operated at 1 atm.I5 The samples were treated in the reactor at 465 "C 
for 1 h under an oxygen flow of 0.83 mL s-l. After the oxygen treatment 
a reacting gas mixture (usually methane and oxygen) was introduced, 
and 
the catalyst was raised to the desired temperature. A typical flow rate 
of the reactant gas mixture was 0.83 mL s-'. Helium (Airco, >99.995%)

was used as a diluent to achieve a total pressure of 1 atm. For the first 
run on a fresh catalyst the activity was measured after 3 h of reaction. 
All of the gases except HCHO were analyzed by gas chromatography; 
the method has been described in detail e1~ewhere.I~ 
Typically a 98% 
carbon mass balance was achieved by this method. 
The surface area of the used catalysts was measured by a volumetric 
method with krypton at -196 "C. The cross-sectional area of a krypton 
molecule was assumed to be 19.5 X 
EPR 
Measurements. The EPR spectra of [Li'O-] centers (see below) 
in the catalysts were measured at - 
196 "C using a Varian E-6S EPR 
spectrometer. A new type of reactor was constructed in which the sam- 
ples were heated under the presence of 0, 
(or an 02/Ar mixture) and 
then were dropped into liquid oxygen (or solid argon) at -196 OC." This 
quenching technique was necessary to observe the [Li'O-] centers be- 
cause these are transient centers which exist in an equilibrium state only 
at elevated temperatures.I8 The catalyst was subsequently transferred 
to a fused quartz EPR side arm. The EPR spectra were recorded after 
the gases were evacuated at -196 "C. The gvalues are reported relative 
to a phosphorus-doped silicon standard with g = 1.9987. In this paper 
only the relative concentration of the [Li'O-] centers is reported. This 
was obtained by measuring the signal height in the EPR spectra. It 
should be noted that the shape of the signal was independent of the 
amplitude. 
Results 
Effect of the Lithium Concentration. To examine the effects 
of the lithium, catalytic runs were carried out at 620 "C over 0.5-g 
catalysts promoted with various concentrations of Li'. 
The results 
are summarized in Table I. 
In the absence of a catalyst no 
reaction occurred under these experimental conditions. 
Table I shows that the Li/MgO catalysts resulted in the for- 
mation of C2H6 
and C2H4 (C, compounds) in addition to CO and 
C02, 
while the unpromoted oxide produced no C, compounds. 
Among this set of catalysts the maximum conversion of CH4 
was 
achieved over 1% Li/MgO with 54.7% selectivity for C2. Better 
selectivities for C, (ca. 70%) were achieved over the catalysts 
promoted with 7% or more Li'. 
The amounts of CH4 
converted 
over Li/MgO were higher than over the pure oxide by factors of 
2 to 4. The surface area measured after the catalytic runs was 
considerably lower for Li/MgO; thus the conversions based on 
an equivalent surface area were 20-30-fold greater over Li/MgO 
than over pure MgO. In a separate experiment the effect of MgO 
surface area on selectivity was evaluated by comparing high 
surface area (34 m2/g) and low surface area (8 m2/g) MgO 
catalysts. At comparable conversion (16%) the C2 
selectivities 
were 5 and 29%, respectively. 
Maximum Yields for the C2 
Compounds. In order to obtain the 
maximum C2 
yields over Li/MgO, with high selectivities, catalytic 
runs were carried out using 4 g of 3 and 7% Li/MgO. Table I1 
summarizes results obtained at 720 "C; higher and lower tem- 
peratures gave lower yields for C2.19 Methanol and formaldehyde

were also detected, but only in trace amounts. In the absence of 
the catalyst, conversion of CH4 
was only 0.2% under the same 
experimental conditions. 
When a reactant gas mixture contained about twice as much 
CH4 
as 02, 
both the C, selectivity and the CH, conversion were 
generally very good; about 50% selectivity was achieved at a 38% 
conversion level (runs no. 1 and 5). Approximately 85% of 0, 
in the reactant mixture was consumed in these runs. Good results 
were also obtained for the reactant mixtures containing higher 
partial pressures of CH4 
and 0, 
if the ratio of the two gases was 
kept at nearly two (runs no. 4 and 8). Note that the ratio of He 
to 0, 
in the reactant mixture of run no. 8 is close to that of N, 
to 0, 
in air. A larger CH, to 0, 
ratio led to a higher C, selectivity 
but to a lower conversion (runs no. 2 and 7), while a lower CH, 
to 0, 
ratio resulted in a higher conversion but in lower C2 
se- 
lectivity (runs no. 3 and 6). The catalyst used in runs no. 5 through 
8 had a very low surface area, ca. 2 m2 g-l, after the reaction. 
A very high C2 selectivity of 80% was obtained when the same 
reactant mixture as used in Table I was fed over 2.9 g of 7% 
Li/MgO at 670 "C, but the conversion dropped to 9.5%. The 
results presented in Table I1 
are considerably better than literature 
values reported recently.316,7 
The maximum C2 
yields were no more 
than 5% in these earlier studies. 
The decrease in catalytic activity during the reaction was ex- 
amined over 1 g of 7% Li/MgO at 700 OC, and the results are 
shown in Figure 1. In 
these experiments the reactant mixture 
was introduced over a catalyst which had been heated at 700 "C 
for 2 h in a helium flow. This pretreatment led to the evolution 
of CO, from any carbonates which might be decomposed under 
these conditions (see below). The conversion dropped from 27.0 
5064 J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 107, No. 18, 1985 
Ito, Wang, 
and Lunsford 
to 20.3% in the first 15 
h, but after this period very little change 
in activity was observed. This initial deactivation was mainly due 
to a decrease in the rate of CO, formation which resulted in an 
increase in C2 
selectivity. The decrease in C2 
yield was only 1.5% 
(from 14.9 
to 13.4%) 
after 15 
h. The surface area of this catalyst 
measured after a long period of reaction was ca. 2 
m2 g-'. 
At 720 
"C C2H4 was the main C2 
compound, but C2H6 
was 
also produced in considerable amounts (Table 11). The former 
is considered to be a more valuable chemical than the latter; thus 
it is desirable to convert C2H6 
into C2H4. This conversion proceeds 
rather easily over several catalysts.20 
X-ray powder diffraction of the 7% Li/MgO catalyst used at 
700 and 770 
O
C
 indicated that two phases were present, MgO 
and Li2C03. The carbonate is not extensively decomposed at these 
temperatures (the decomposition pressure reaches 760 
torr at 13 
1
0
 
OC21), although some Li20 
is probably present. The solubility 
of lithium ions in a MgO lattice is also small. The actual con- 
centration of lithium in single crystals of MgO, which were grown 
by an arc-fusion technique using MgO powder doped with Li2C03 
to a concentration of about 5% by weight, was only 0.03 
to 0.05 
atom %.18 
In view of the relatively large mole fraction of Li in these 
samples, the catalytic properties of the Li20/Li2C03 
phase must 
be considered. A 0.22-g 
sample of the carbonate (surface area 
(SA) = 0.6 
m2 g-]) was tested and found to be less active by a 
factor of 1
0
 
at 700 
OC than a 7% Li/MgO catalyst which con- 
tained an equivalent amount of Li'. 
A 
5.5-g 
sample of Li2C0, 
(SA 
= 0.4 
m2 
g-I) catalyzed at 675 
OC a 5% conversion of CH4 
(CH4:02 
= 2:l) 
with a C2 
selectivity of 70%. Thus, if the Li2C03 
remained undispersed its contribution to the overall activity would 
be negligible. If, however, the Li2C03 
spread uniformly over the 
MgO, its contribution would be dominant. In order to explore 
this possibility XPS experiments were carried out to determine 
the remaining exposed Mg2+ 
in the used catalysts. By measuring 
the Mg/O area ratios in the XPS spectra it is estimated that for 
the used 3 and 7% Li/MgO catalysts of Table I1 the remaining 
exposed Mg2+ 
was 70 
and 45%, respectively. Runs no. 1 and 5 
show that the activities and selectivities for the two catalysts were 
very similar; however, if the reaction were catalyzed mainly by 
LiO/Li2C03, 
one would expect that the sample with the larger 
amount of Li2C03 
would exhibit the greater activity. It is also 
possible to estimate the contribution of the dispersed Li,CO, to 
the total activity. At 670 
OC the Li2C03 
promoted about 2.3% 
conversion/m2 Li2C03. From the XPS data 30% of the 3% 
Li/MgO catalyst (SA = 1 m2 g-l) is Li2C03. The expected 
conversion from Li,CO, on 4 
g of this material is 2.8%. The total 
conversion on the 3% Li/MgO catalyst at 670 
O
C
 was 21%; thus 
up to 13% of the total activity may have been derived from the 
Li,CO, phase. The latter percentage, which is an upper limit, 
probably increases with an increasing amount of Li2C03. The 
mode of addition of the lithium does not seem to be critical, as 
a sample prepared from an aqueous solution of LiN0, and Mg- 
(NO,), by adding N H 4 0 H  had a catalytic activity at 700 OC 
comparable to that exhibited by the Li/MgO catalyst prepared 
from Li2C03. 
The identification of the active component currently is being 
addressed from another standpoint. The model for selective 
conversion of CH4 
described below requires that the alkali metal 
ion be able to substitute for the alkaline earth ion. Although 
Na2C03 
has activity similar to that of Li,CO,, a Na2C03/Mg0 
catalyst exhibits poor activity and selectivity.22 By contrast 
Na,CO,/CaO is an active and selective catalyst, comparable to 
Li,CO,/MgO. The most obvious explanation for these phenomena 
is that Naf ions are too large to substitute for Mg2+ 
ions, but they

(22) At 700 'C, PCH4 
= 100 torr, and Po, = 40 torr, the conversion and 
selectivity over 15% Na/CaO (1 g) were 22 and 52%, respectively. Under 
the same conditions, the conversion and selectivity over 20% Na/MgO (1 g) 
were only 12 and 18% respectively. The sodium levels correspond to a 
constant mol %.

may easily substitute for Ca2+ 
ions. Moreover, these observations 
support the conclusion made here that the major part of the 
activity results from the substitution of a monovalent cation into 
a divalent site, and not simply from the enhanced dispersion of 
the alkali carbonate. 
Kinetic Measurements. After the long-term experiment depicted 
in Figure 1, kinetic experiments described in this section were 
carried out using the same catalyst (7% Li/MgO, 1 g) because 
of its stable activity. In order to obtain kinetic parameters at low 
conversions, all reactions were carried out at 620 
"C, except when 
the temperature effect was determined. Conversions were always 
kept at less than 6% for CH4, 
but in a few cases 1
0
 
to 18% of the 
O2 
was consumed during the reaction. 
The partial pressure of CH4 converted into each product is 
depicted in Figure 2 
as a function of the pseudo-contact time, W/F, 
where W 
is the weight of catalyst and F 
is the flow rate of the 
reactant mixture. The sum of the partial pressure of all the 
products, as well as the partial pressure of each component, 
changed linearly with W/F 
values above 0.8 
g s mL-]. Moreover, 
in a separate experiment it was observed that the conversion was 
proportional to the amount of catalyst present. 
The lines in Figure 2, 
however, do not pass through the origin. 
A similar phenomenon was also observed in a W/F 
region of 0 
to 18 
g s mL-' when 4 
g of 7% Li/MgO was used. The reason 
for this unusual phenomenon is not obvious. It is unlikely that 
a diffusion process is operative because the linear relation holds 
over a wide range of W/F values. The absence of diffusion 
limitations is also supported by the fact that the surface area of 
the catalyst was low (2 
m2 g-'), which suggests the absence of 
micropores. As described later a chain mechanism is operative 
to some degree, and this may explain the abnormal relation be- 
tween the contact time and the partial pressure.

The temperature dependence of each product is shown 
in Figure 3. The partial pressure of CH4 
converted into each 
product rapidly increased with the reaction temperature, except 
for CO which did not increase appreciably above 640 OC. It should 
be emphasized that the C2 
selectivity was greater at the higher 
temperatures; the observed C2

means that the C, compounds can be produced in much greater 
yields at higher temperatures because both the CH4

In order to understand the reaction mechanism more fully, the 
partial pressure of CH4 
converted into products was determined 
as a function of the pressure of each reactant. The effect of 0, 
pressure is shown in Figure 4, where the C, (CO plus CO,) and 
the C, (C& 
plus C2H4) pressures are illustrated. As shown 
below, C2H4 was produced mainly by the further oxidation of 
C2H6. In 
fact, the dependence on O2 
pressure was similar for C2H6 
and C2H4, though the former was produced in higher concen- 
trations than the latter by factors of 7 to 10 at these levels of 
conversion. The COz 
to C O  
ratio in the product mixture was 4 
to 6. 
The presence of two regions in the dependence of total CHI 
conversion on the O2 
pressure is apparent in Figure 4. The amount 
of CH4 
converted increased steeply with the increase in O2 
pressure 
below 50 torr, but above this pressure the increase was much slower 
though it was still approximately linear. Below 50 torr the increase 
resulted mainly from the C2 
products. O

in the product mixture, of the component which is fed as a reactant. 
C O  and C 0 2  
increased above 50 torr; the C, formation decreased 
with increasing O2 
pressure. 
Figure 5 illustrates the effect of the CH4 
pressure. In this case 
the conversion of CH4 
increased gradually over the entire pressure 
range. A log-log plot showed that this increase was approximately 
proportional to the 0.4 power of the CH4 
pressure. In the very 
low pressure region, less than 40 torr, C O  and CO, increased 
steeply, while above 40 torr the increase in conversion was mainly 
due to C2 
(especially to C,H6). Ratios of C2H6 
to C2H4 and C02 
to C O  in the products were approximately 6 and 4, respectively. 
In determining a mechanism it is important to know whether 
the C O  and CO, came from the C2 
compounds or from CH4 
via 
another pathway. This was examined at 620 "C by feeding either 
CHI or C2H6 
as the reactant, and the results are summarized in 
Table 111. In run no. 1 an ordinary reactant of CH4 
was fed, 
while C2H6 was used in run no. 2. The partial pressure of C2H6 
in the reactant mixture was chosen to be approximately equal to 
the sum (3.45 torr) of the partial pressures of all the products in 
the former run. The total amount of C O  
and CO, produced from 
CH, was larger than that from C2H6 by a factor of 3.6. In 
addition, it is important to note that C2H6 can easily react with 
surface 0- 
ions to produce C2H4, CO, and C02.8,9,23 
This strongly 
suggests that active sites for the conversion of CHI and C2H6 
are 
the same. These centers competitively react with CH, and C2H6 
if both the reactants coexist. This situation is actually reflected 
in run no. 3 where both the reactants were present. For example, 
the amount of C2H4 produced in this run was less than that in 
run no. 2 where only C2H6 
was present. Based on these consid- 
erations we conclude that at 620 "C and low CH4 
conversions 
the dominant route to produce C O  and C02 
is not the further 
oxidation of C2H6, 
By comparing runs no. 1 and 2 similar ar- 
guments can be used to show that C O  and C 0 2  
are not derived 
primarily from C2H4.

Discussion 
Active Centers for the Formation of Methyl Radicals. The 
presence of ethane as a major product suggests the formation and 
coupling of methyl radicals; thus the ensuing discussion will focus 
on the active site for the formation of these radicals and their 
subsequent reactions, both on the surface and in the gas phase. 
It is convenient to divide the reactioh into two steps: (1) the 
formation of [Li'O-] centers and the generation of CH3- 
on them, 
and (2) the formation of the stable products from CH3.. 
The [Li'O-] centers have been studied in detail by Abraham 
and co-workers using single crystals of MgO and CaO doped with 
Li.18,26-29 
The [Li'O-] centers could be produced thermally by 
heating their samples above 1000 "C in the presence of O2 
and 
then rapidly quenching them. According to their mechanism 
thermally generated [Li'O-] centers in MgO are the result of the 
diffusion of Li' ions from regions of Li20 precipitates to sub- 
stitutional Mg2' sites; the rapid cooling from high temperatures 
prevents the Li' ions from reaggregation which leads to the 
disappearance of the [Li'O-] centers.29 It is also possible that 
quenching prevents the [Li+O-] centers from releasing their 
trapped holes, which results in the desorption of O2.I7 
The mechanism for the [Li'O-] 
formation in the powder 
samples used in this study is analogous to that described above 
except that the substitutional Li+ ions are generated from Li2C03 
precipitates instead of Li20.2s330 For every two Li' ions leaving 
carbonate phases, only one Mg2' enters to form MgC03.27 
From 
stoichiometric considerations, this excess of cations in the MgO 
matrix suggests the formation of oxygen vacancies which may exist 
on the surface. Gaseous oxygen molecules, however, immediately 
react with the vacancies at high temperatures, resulting in 02- 
ions and holes. The [Li+O-] centers are produced by these holes 
being trapped at 02- 
ions which are adjacent to Li+ ions.29 
This process may be expressed as follows: 
2Li+02- + + 1/202 
e 
2Li'O- + 02- 
(1) 
where 0 
denotes an oxygen vacancy. Although reaction 1 is not 
necessarily a true equilibrium state, the number of [Li'O-] centers 
are mainly determined by the temperature and the oxygen 
pressure. The mechanism for the formation of [Li'O-] centers 
in these catalysts will be treated in detail e1~ewhere.I~ 
The [Li'O-] centers also probably exist in the Li20/Li2C03 
phase and are responsible for the activity of this material. An 
attempt is currently being made to detect [Li'O-] centers in 
quenched Li2C03. At considerably higher temperatures (1 
527 
"C) LiO has been detected in the vapor phase over Li20, 
and the 
molecules may best be described by a completely ionic model, Le., 
In a series of related experiments it has been demonstrated that 
methyl radicals were produced when methane and oxygen were 
passed over similar Li-promoted MgO catalysts at 500 "C. The 
methyl radicals formed at the surface were released into the gas 
phase and trapped downstream in a solid argon matrix, where they 
were analyzed by EPR spectroscopy.2s~30 
It is significant that the 
rate of radical formation and the concentration of [Li+O-] centers 
behaved in a parallel manner with respect to Li loading. Thus,

Oxidation by N20. Nitrous oxide is an effective oxidant for 
the partial oxidation of alkanes provided electrons are available 
for the formation of 0- via the reaction N,O + e- - 
N2 + 
0-.9J2-15.24 
By contrast, N20 
is not as effective as O2 
in the 
generation of CH,. from CH, over pure Mg0.2S Preliminary 
experiments were carried out at 620 "C over several Li/MgO 
catalysts using N 2 0  
as the oxidant. At low Li loadings (<1%) 
the total CH4 
conversion was comparable to that found with 0, 
as the oxidant, but at greater Li loadings the conversions were 
much less with N20. Moreover, for Li loadings > 
1%, the yield 
for C2 
products was substantially greater with 02. 
For example, 
under the experimental conditions of Table I and at 7% Li, with 
N 2 0  
as the oxidant, the C2 
yield was 0.16% compared to 1.92% 
with O2 
as the oxidant. 
EPR Spectra. The 7% Li/MgO catalyst used in the runs listed 
in Table I1 was examined by EPR spectroscopy, and the spectra 
obtained are illustrated in Figure 6. When this sample was heated 
at high temperatures in the presence of O2 
and then quenched 
to -196 "C, a clear signal was observed at g ,  = 2.054 (spectrum 
a), This signal is in excellent agreement with the published value 
of g, = 2.0545 for [Li'O-] centers in MgO single crystals.'* The 
gll 
component at 2.0049 was not resolved, presumably because of 
overlap with strong signals of impurity ions such as Fe3+. In a 
related study, however, the g,, 
component was clearly seen following 
UV irradiation of the catalyst at -196 OC.I7 An additional signal 
appeared in this spectrum at g ,  = 2.038 with a much weaker 
intensity. This g ,  component is consistent with that of 0- 
or V- 
centers in Mg0.23 Only a trace amount of [Li'O-] was evident 
when the catalyst was slowly cooled from high temperatures. 
Neither [Li'O-] centers nor V- centers were detected when the 
same sample was heated in a pure argon atmosphere (spectrum 
b); i.e., the presence of O2 
during the heat treatment is essential 
for the creation of both the centers. These observations are 
consistent with the formation of [Li'O-] in MgO single crystals.18 
Fresh samples, which had not been used in catalytic runs, 
behaved in a very similar manner as the used catalysts although 
the signal intendity was greater in the used catalysts. In an 
unpromoted MgO sample [Li+O-] centers and V- centers were 
not observed, even after heating in 0, followed by quenching 
(spectrum c). 
The solid points in Figure 4 illustrate the effect of oxygen partial 
pressure on the signal intensity of [Li'O-] centers. The samples

it was concluded that CH3. 
was produced by a reaction between 
CH, and 0- 
of [Li'O-] centers: 
Li'O- + CHI - 
LifOH- + CH,. 
( 2 )  
Under the experimental conditions employed in this study, CH3. 
is believed to be formed in a similar manner. 
The regeneration of [Li'O-] 
centers after reaction 2 was 
proposed to occur by the following scheme:25 
2Li+OH- - 
Li+02- 
+ Li' 0 
+ H20 
Li+02- + Li+ + '/202 
- 
2Li+O- 
(3) 
(4) 
The [Li'O-] centers produced in reaction 4 again react with CH4 
by reaction 2. The latter does not appear to be an activated process 
because most of the 0- 
ions on Mo/Si02, for example, reacted 
with CH, even at 77 K.9 Reaction 3 is a typical dehydroxylation 
process which requires high temperatures. Reaction 4 may also 
require high temperatures because it includes the dissociation of 
the 0-0 bond, and perhaps the migration of Li' ions. Either 
reaction 3 or 4 is the rate-determining step in the catalytic pro- 
duction of CH3.. 
An alternate pathway may be possible for the regeneration 
process of reactions 3 and 4. In the MgO matrix Li+ would be 
stabilized more by a nearby monovalent negative charge than by 
divalent or neutral one. In 
such a case the regeneration process 
is expressed as follows: 
2Li+OH- - 
Li+O- + Li+ + H20 
Li+ + '/*02 
- 
Li+O-

where

Both the intensity of [Li'O-] centers and the total amount of 
CH, converted showed very similar 02-pressure dependence 
(Figure 4). Thus, the number of [Li'O-] centers available during 
the catalytic reaction is believed to be proportional to that observed 
by EPR. The latter amount was present in the equilibrium state 
which was controlled by reaction 1.

In the temperature range below 700 "C both the CH, conversion 
and the C2 
selectivity were greater at higher temperatures (Figure 
3). According to reaction 7 the formation of the C2 
compounds 
should be proportional to the square of the CH,. concentration, 
while the amount of CO plus CO, is expected to follow some lower 
order with respect to CH,. concentration (see below). Higher 
temperatures produce more methyl radicals which are favorable 
for the C2 
formation. This situation can be realized only when 
further oxidation of C2 
to CO and C02 
is relatively small. Above 
700 "C further oxidation becomes appreciable, leading to the 
observed decrease in C2 
~electivity.'~ 
At the lower temperatures carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide 
also were produced mainly through CH,.. This may be demon- 
strated by considering the following data. The concentration of 
[Li'O-] centers increased slowly with increasing pressure of O2 
above 50 torr (Figure 4); 
therefore, the rate of methyl radical 
formation by reaction 2 also is expected to increase gradually. 
In this pressure range, however, the amount of C2 decreased 
considerably, while the amount of CO plus C02 
increased. Since 
only a small part of the CO and C02 
was derived from further 
oxidation of C2 
compounds (Table 111), the observed decrease in 
J. Am. Chem. SOC., 
Vol. 107, No. 18, 1985 5067 
C2 
formation must be compensated by the formation of additional 
CO and C02 
from CH3..

In pathway 11, CO and C02 are produced from C2 com-

As discussed previously, this was not a major route 
to CO and C02 
at the reaction temperature of 620 "C in the 
presence of CHI (Table 111). In pathway 12 the reaction of CH3. 
with surface 02- 
ions results in methoxy ions, which subsequently 
d e c o m p ~ s e . ~ * ~  
The formation of CO and C02 
via this reaction 
should be related to the surface area of the catalysts. In the 
experiments discussed here the reaction temperature was suffi- 
ciently high to decompose surface OCH,- ions according to8 
OCH3- - 
CO + 3/2H2 
+ e- 
(14) 
The decrease in CO and C02 
production as a function of the time 
on stream (Figure 1) may result from a decrease in surface area 
due to sintering of the catalyst. The direct relationship between 
C1 
selectivity and surface area, described above, supports this 
hypothesis. 
Pathway 13 is a gas-phase reaction between CH,. and O2 
to 
produce CH3O2.  radical^.^^-,^ 
In this case the aiiiount of CO 
and C02 
should depend on the O2 
pressure. Below 50 torr of 
oxygen pressure the total amount of CH, converted, shown in 
Figure 4, increased significantly with the O2 
pressure. This in- 
crease is mainly due to a similar increase in [Li+O-] concentration 
(Figure 4). In this pressure range, the C2 
compounds increased 
more than the CO plus CO,. Above 50 torr the total amount of 
CH, converted continued to increase, but with a more gentle slope. 
The concentration of [Li'O-] centers also increased although its 
increment was less than that of CH, converted. It should be noted 
that, in this pressure range, the amount of C2 
decreased while the 
amount of CO plus C02 
increased. In order to explain this 
phenomenon, reaction 13 also must be included as one of the main 
routes for complete oxidation. 
Methylperoxy radicals, which were observed over Li/MgO 
together with C H , V , ~ ~

Since CH30H 
and HCHO were detected only in trace amounts, 
it is likely that these products were further oxidized at the elevated 
temperatures. Reaction 15 is actually reversible, and a ratio of 
[CH302-]/[CH3.] 
= 0.056 at 60 torr of O2 
and 620 "C has been 
estimated.36 In view of the high C2 
selectivities which could be 
obtained in these experiments, the chain reaction described by 
reactions 15 to 20 probably was not significant over the Li/MgO 
catalysts except when larger partial pressures of O2 
were used. 
Conclusions 
Ethane and ethylene are produced in high yields with good 
selectivities when CHI and O2 
are passed over Li/MgO catalysts 
at higbtemperatures. These C2 
compounds are formed via the

Abstract: The decomposition of tetramethyldioxetane (TMD) following either overtone excitation or infrared multiple photon 
excitation (IRMPE) under low-pressure conditions is discussed and compared to recent results obtained upon UV photoexcitation 
of acetone vapor. It is shown that the results are consistent with a mechanism by which IR excitation of TMD results in producing 
electronically excited acetone, which may be considered as a mixed state containing contributions from both the singlet and 
the triplet states. 
The chemiluminescent decomposition of tetramethyldioxetane 
(TMD) has been studied extensively in liquid solutions'-4 and to 
a somewhat lesser extent in the gas phase. The reaction seems 
to be well characterized kinetically and in thermal systems an 
Arrhenius expression of the type k( 
T) = A, exp(-E,/RT) 
fits the 
unimolecular decay rates reasonably well, with A, = lo'> 
s-' and 
E, in the range of 24-26 kcal/mol. Low-pressure vapor-phase 
measurements, using overtone excitation (OTE)5 and infrared 
multiphoton excitation (IRMPE),6%7 
can be interpreted by using 
a statistical model with k(E), 
the energy-dependent decomposition 
rate constant, calculable from the RRKM t h e ~ r y . ~ . ~  
Since the 
reaction results in electronically excited products, it has been 
arguedI0 that it does not lead to the statistically most probable 
products. This fact is not in conflict with applying RRKM theory 
to the process as rapid energy redistribution in the vibrationally 
excited parent molecule, prior to the reaction, is the only basic 
requirement. We have recently proposed'~" that if vibrational 
energy is indeed rapidly scrambled, the energy distributions of 
molecules excited by IRMPE can be estimated by comparison 
with OTE results. 
In this paper we discuss another aspect of the reaction, the 
nature of the electronically excited product. Most early work on

TMD was performed in liquid solutions under conditions where 
vibrational relaxation is much faster than the reaction rate or the 
decay of electronically excited states. On the basis of fluorescence 
sensitization experimentsI2 
and on chemical titration methods1> 
it has been concluded that the major product is acetone triplet 
in its vibrationally relaxed state (TIVR). 
The quantum yield has 
been estimated to range between 30 and 50%,4 namely almost 
quantitative. On energetic grounds, only one of the two product 
acetone molecules can be electronically excited. Some vibrationally 
relaxed singlet acetone (SIVR) 
is also formed. Its yield is low with 
estimates ranging between 
to 
Low-pressure vapor-phase work, based on rapid excitation by 
laser sources,6 
appeared at first to be at variance with these results. 
Under these conditions, the time evolution of the system can be 
studied with lo-* s time resolution. The amount of internal energy 
in the reacting molecules can be controlled by varying the laser's 
wavelength (in OTE experiments) or fluence (in IRMPE work). 
Thus, the rate of the reaction can be varied, as well as the internal 
energy in the product molecules. Furthermore, the resulting 
kinetics and emission spectra can be studied in real time. 
A complicated kinetic pattern is revealed5 with the emission 
decay being distinctly nonexponential. Overtone results could be 
approximately reproduced by fitting the observed chemilu- 
minescence (CL) signal intensity, IC-, to the following empirical 
relation 
ICL(t) 
= -A exp(-kt) + B exp(-k2t) + C exp(-k3t) 
(1) 
The first term relates to the reaction rate and is strongly de- 
pendent on the internal energy in the excited TMD molecules. 
The second and third terms are due to the decay of two kinetically 
distinct species, termed by Cannon and Crims (CC) the fast and 
slow components, The slow component can be identified with TVR, 
based on its decay time and emission spectrum. The fast one is 
clearly not the singlet observed in liquid solution or previous
