The combustion technique produces ionically dispersed Ag on a nano-crystalline
surface. The catalysts
CeO2
thus produced were characterized by X-ray di†raction, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy. Catalytic properties towards NO reduction, CO and hydrocarbon oxidation have
been investigated using the temperature programmed reaction technique in a packed bed tubular reactor.
These results are compared with
supported Ðnely divided Ag metal particles synthesized by the same
a-Al2O3
method. Both oxidation and reduction reactions over

Introduction
The catalytic activity of dispersed metals on a support is inÑu-
enced by a number of factors, namely, size, shape, extent of
dispersion, relative amount of metals present, chemical nature
of the support and the strength of interaction between the
support and the metal.1 The method of preparation plays an
important role in the behavior of these catalysts. Some of the
well known methods used to prepare these catalysts are
impregnation, ion exchange, anchoringÈgrafting, spreadingÈ
wetting and depositionÈprecipitation.2 All these methods are
quite involved and require long processing times. There has
been a growing interest towards novel chemical routes of syn-
thesis leading to ultra-Ðne, high surface area catalysts. Recent-
ly, we have reported the preparation, by the combustion
technique, of
and nano-sized metal particles dis-
Cu/CeO23
persed on
which are active for NO reduction, CO
a-Al2O3
and hydrocarbon oxidation.4,5
Generally zirconia, titania, silica, alumina, ceria and zeolite
supported noble and transition metal catalysts are active for
NO reduction, CO and hydrocarbon oxidation.6h12 Alumina
and zeolite supported Ag catalysts are known for NO
reduction by hydrocarbons.13h19 However, relatively few
studies are found in the literature on ceria supported Ag cata-
lysts. Recently, Kundakovic and Flytzani-Stephanopoulos20
have reported

catalyst. Here

Experimental
Synthesis
The combustion mixture for the preparation of 1% Ag/CeO2
contained
and
(NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 ,
AgNO3
C2H6N4O2
(oxalyldihydrazide) in the mole ratio of 0.99 : 0.01 : 2.381.
Oxalyldihydrazide (ODH) was used as the fuel. In a typical
preparation, 10 g of
(E. Merck India, 99%),
(NH4)2Ce(NO3)6
0.031 g of
(E. Merck India, 99.9%) and 5.186 g of
AgNO3
ODH were dissolved in the minimum volume of water in a
borosilicate dish of 130 cm3 capacity. The dish containing the
redox mixture was introduced into a muffle furnace main-
tained at 350 ¡C. The solution boiled with frothing, foaming
and ignited to burn with a Ñame (D1000 ¡C) yielding a volu-
minous solid product within 5 min.

the catalysts were carried out in an open muffle furnace kept
in a fume cupboard with an exhaust. The reaction can be con-
trolled by performing the combustion in an open vessel. As-
prepared combustion products, without further reduction by
have been used for all studies.

Characterization
The X-ray di†raction (XRD) patterns of ceria supported Ag
catalyst were recorded on a Siemens, D5005 di†ractometer
using Cu-Ka radiation with a scan rate of 2¡ min~1. Trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM) of powders was carried
out using a JEOL JEM-200CX transmission electron micro-
scope operated at 200 kV.
X-Ray photoelectron spectra of the supported Ag catalyst
were recorded on an ESCA-3 Mark II spectrometer (V G
ScientiÐc, Sussex, England) using Al Ka radiation (1486.6 eV).
Binding energies were calculated with respect to C(1s) at 285
eV. For X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis the
powder samples were made into pellets of 8 mm diameter and
placed into an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber at 10~9
Torr.
Temperature programmed reaction (TPR)
The catalytic reactions were carried out in a TPR system
equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer QXK300

(V G ScientiÐc, Suissex, England) using a packed bed tubular
reactor. Typically 0.1È0.2 g of the catalyst was mounted in a
quartz tube reactor of 20 cm length and 6 mm diameter. The
reactor can be heated from 30 to 750 ¡C at a rate of 15 ¡C
min~1 and the sample temperature was measured by a Ðne
chromeÈalumel thermocouple immersed in the catalyst. The
quartz tube was evacuated to 10~6 Torr. The gaseous pro-
ducts were sampled through a Ðne control leak valve to an
UHV system housing the quadrupole mass spectrometer at
10~9 Torr. The gases were passed over the catalyst at a Ñow
rate of 25 lmol s~1; the Ñow rate can be varied from 10 to 40
lmol s~1. Accordingly, the space velocity was in the range of
5 ] 10~5 to 2 ] 10~4 mol g~1 s~1. The dynamic pressure of
gases in the reaction system was in the range of 1 to 20 Torr
in all experiments. All the masses were scanned every 10 s.
The intensity of each mass as a function of temperature
(thermogram) was generated at the end of the reaction. All the
gases were obtained from Bhoruka Gases, Bangalore. Their
purities were better than 99% as analyzed by the quadrupole
mass spectrometer.

Catalytic properties
Reduction of NO by CO over 1%
catalyst starts at
Ag/CeO2
150 ¡C and complete NO reduction occurs below 270 ¡C.
Typical TPR proÐles of NO ] CO reaction over this catalyst
are given in Fig. 4. The decrease in NO (m/z \ 30) intensity
with a simultaneous increase in
(m/z \ 44) is considered
CO2
as a measure of the conversion of NO. As
and CO have
N2
the same mass, above 185 ¡C the mass peak intensity at
m/z \ 28 is due to

Similarly, CO oxidation was carried out over 1% Ag/CeO2
as well as over 3%
catalysts in the presence of
Ag/CeO2
O2 .
A sharp decrease in CO intensity over 1%
is noticed

sideration. The Ce4` ion seems to stabilize Ag` ions instead
of its separation into Ag metal particles in the combustion

Conclusion
The important features of this investigation are:
(1) The combustion method is a new single step technique
for the synthesis of
where Ag` ions are dispersed on
Ag/CeO2
a nano-sized
support.
CeO2
(2) Higher catalytic activities of combustion synthesized
have been attributed to the ionically dispersed Ag`
Ag/CeO2
on the
surface.

(3) NO reduction, CO and hydrocarbon oxidation tem-
peratures over
are lower compared to
Ag/CeO2
Ag/Al2O3 .
(4) Interaction between Ag ion and

CeO2
important role for relatively low temperature reactions com-
pared to 1%
