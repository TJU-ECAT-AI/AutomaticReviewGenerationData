 Introduction
With
 the
 soaring
 gasoline
 prices
 and
 the
 increasingly
 strict
emission
 limits,
 natural
 gas
 engines
 are
 widely
 applied
 to
 vehi-
cles
 nowadays
 [1].  In
 addition
 to
 economic
 and
 political
 reasons,
the
 use
 of
 compressed
 natural
 gas
 (CNG)
 for
 automotive
 applica-
tions
 offers
 signiﬁcant
 environmental
 advantages
 over
 gasoline
 and
diesel.
 However,
 the
 natural
 gas
 vehicles
 (NGVs)
 advantages
 are
partially
 balanced
 by
 the
 emission
 of
 unburned
 methane.
 As
 one
of
 greenhouse
 gases,
 methane
 is
 recognized
 to
 contribute
 more
 to
global
 atmosphere
 warming
 than
 CO2 at
 equivalent
 emission
 rates,
all
 the
 more
 since
 its
 lifetime
 is
 quite
 long
 [1,2].
 Therefore,
 the
abatement
 of
 unconverted
 methane
 exhausted
 from
 CNG
 vehicles
becomes
 rather
 important
 [3].
Catalytic
 combustion
 of
 methane
 is
 a
 promising
 technology
that
 can
 convert
 methane
 into
 carbon
 dioxide
 at
 relatively
 low
temperature,
 and
 is
 extensively
 studied
 over
 the
 last
 decade.
Noble
 metal-based
 catalysts,
 especially
 Pd-based
 ones
 can
 exhibit
outstanding
 catalytic
 behavior
 at
 low
 temperatures
 [3–6].

theless,
 catalysts
 based
 on
 transition
 metal
 oxides,
 such
 as
 Mn,
 Cu,
Cr,
 Fe,
 and
 Co
 oxides
 [7–9],
 become
 appealing
 due
 to
 lower
 cost
 and
relative
 abundant
 resources.
 Amongst
 these
 catalysts,
 spinel-type
oxides
 have
 attracted
 much
 attention
 for
 many
 years
 [1,10,11].
Among
 the
 spinel-type-oxides
 catalysts,
 Cr2CoO4 was
 found
 to
be
 very
 active
 for
 the
 oxidation
 of
 hydrocarbons
 [10,11], as
 well
as
 for
 catalytic
 removal
 of
 NOx [12]
 and
 diesel
 soot
 [13].
 As
 we
know,
 doping
 of
 metal-oxide
 can
 result
 in
 a
 material
 which
 has
signiﬁcantly
 different
 properties
 than
 the
 original.
 The
 above
 has
been
 exploited
 in
 several
 investigations
 so
 as
 to
 synthesize
 better
combustion
 catalysts
 [7,14–17].
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 cerium
 is
 a
 well-
known
 additive
 of
 exhaust
 catalysts,
 in
 view
 of
 its
 oxygen
 storage
capacity,
 enabling
 the
 application
 of
 such
 catalysts
 over
 a
 broad
range
 of
 air-to-fuel
 ratios,
 and
 enhancing
 the
 activity
 [14].
 In
 addi-
tion,
 it
 has
 been
 reported
 that
 combination
 of
 CeO2 with
 other
 metal
oxides
 affects
 the
 oxygen
 mobility,
 which
 would
 play
 an
 impor-
tant
 role
 in
 the
 catalytic
 combustion
 of
 methane
 [1,18].
 Therefore,
cerium
 was
 chosen
 as
 the
 dopant
 in
 the
 present
 investigation.
In
 this
 study,
 cerium
 modiﬁed
 cobalt
 chromite
 catalysts
 with
 dif-
ferent
 cerium
 content
 were
 prepared
 by
 co-precipitation
 method
and
 the
 catalytic
 activities
 were
 evaluated
 towards
 methane
 com-
bustion.
 The
 bulk
 structure
 was
 determined
 by
 Raman
 and
 XRD
and
 the
 phase
 segregation
 was
 studied
 by
 SEM.
 The
 reducibility
was
 studied
 by
 CH4 TPR-MS.
 The

 In
 particular,
 the
 objective
 is
 to
 under-
stand
 the
 promotional
 effect
 of
 cerium
 on
 cobalt
 chromite
 catalysts.

 Experimental
2.1.
 Catalyst
 preparation
For
 cerium
 doped
 cobalt
 chromite
 catalysts,
 the
 chromium
 in
CoCr2O4 was
 substituted
 by
 cerium
 with
 different
 substitution
degree
 (molar
 ratio:
 2%,
 5%,
 10%,
 20%,
 50%
 and
 100%).
 The
 catalysts
were
 prepared
 by
 co-precipitation
 method
 following
 a
 reference
procedure
 [19].
 Typically,
 a
 diluted
 aqueous
 ammonia
 (10
 vol.%)
solution
 was
 added
 to
 a
 mixed
 aqueous
 solution
 of
 chromium
nitrate,
 cobalt
 nitrate
 and
 cerium
 nitrate
 drop
 by
 drop
 with
 con-
tinuous
 stirring
 at
 room
 temperature
 until
 the
 pH
 value
 was
 9.30.
The
 precipitates
 were
 ﬁltered,
 washed
 several
 times
 and
 dried
 in
an
 air
 oven.
 Finally,
 the
 dried
 materials
 were
 calcined
 at
 700 ◦C
 for
4
 h.
 The
 available
 powders
 were
 ready
 for
 the
 methane
 oxidation
activity
 measurements
 after
 being
 crushed
 and
 sieved.
2.2.
 Catalyst
 characterization
The
 X-ray
 diffraction
 (XRD)
 measurements
 were
 carried
 out
with
 a
 Rigaku
 D/max-2500
 X-ray
 diffractometer
 using
 Ni
 ﬁltered
Cu
 K
 radiation.
 The
 applied
 current
 and
 voltage
 were
 200
 mA  and
45
 kV,
 respectively.
 During
 the
 analysis,
 the
 samples
 were
 scanned
from
 10
 to
 90◦at
 a
 speed
 of
 6◦/min.
Raman
 spectra
 (RS)
 of
 the
 samples
 were
 recorded
 on
 a
 Renishaw
RM
 2000
 instrument.
 A
 633
 nm
 He/Ne
 laser
 source
 at
 a
 power
 of
4.7
 mW
 was
 used
 at
 a
 scanning
 range
 of
 100–1200
 nm.
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
 (BET)
 surface
 areas
 and
 pore
 param-
eters
 of
 the
 samples
 were
 measured
 by
 nitrogen
 physisorption
 at
liquid
 nitrogen
 temperature
 (77
 K)
 on
 a
 Micromeritics
 ASAP
 2010
micropore
 size
 analyzer.
 The
 pore
 size
 distribution
 was
 calculated
from
 the
 desorption
 branch
 of
 the
 N2 adsorption
 isotherm
 using
the
 Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
 (BJH)
 method.
Field-emission
 
scanning
 
electron
 
microscopy
 
(SEM)
 
was
obtained
 by
 using
 a
 JEOL
 JSM-6700F
 instrument
 operating
 at
 a
 beam
energy
 of
 3.0
 kV.
X-ray
 photoelectron
 spectroscopy
 (XPS)
 data
 were
 obtained
with
 a
 PHI-5300/ESCA
 electron
 spectrometer
 with
 Mg  and
 Al
 radi-
ation
 at
 a
 pressure
 lower
 than
 10−7 Pa.
 The
 binding
 energies
 were
referenced
 to
 the
 C
 1
 s
 line
 at
 284.8
 eV
 from
 adventitious
 carbon.
Temperature
 programmed
 reduction
 of
 methane
 (CH4 TPR-MS)
was
 carried
 out
 in
 a
 quartz
 ﬂow
 microreactor.
 The
 catalyst
 (100
 mg),
held
 in
 the
 quartz
 tube,
 was
 degassed
 with
 He
 (30
 mL/min)
 at
600 ◦C
 for
 1
 h,
 and
 then
 the
 temperature
 was
 allowed
 to
 decrease
 to
room
 temperature.
 The
 TPR
 tests
 were
 performed
 with
 a
 20
 mL/min
mixture
 of
 CH4/He
 (5%
 CH4),
 at
 a
 rate
 of
 10 ◦C/min
 from
 room
temperature
 to
 1000 ◦C
 maintaining
 ﬁnally
 this
 temperature
 for
100
 min
 under
 the
 reactant
 mixture.
 Gases
 evolving
 from
 the
 reac-
tor
 were
 analyzed
 with
 a
 Pfeiffer
 Omnistar
 quadrupolar
 mass
spectrometer.
Temperature-programmed
 desorption
 of
 oxygen
 (O2-TPD)
 were
studied
 in
 the
 same
 system.
 100
 mg  of
 the
 catalyst
 was
 loaded
in
 a
 quartz
 reactor
 and
 prior
 the
 measurement,
 the
 sample
 was
heated
 in
 a
 5%
 O2/He
 ﬂow
 (30
 mL/min)
 at
 600 ◦C
 and
 remained
 in
this
 temperature
 for
 1
 h.
 After
 cooling
 in
 O2 to
 room
 temperature,
the
 ﬂowing
 gas
 was
 then
 switched
 to
 helium
 (20
 mL/min)
 to
 elimi-
nate
 the
 physically
 adsorbed
 oxygen.
 Temperature
 was
 then
 raised
at
 a
 rate
 of
 10 ◦C/min
 from
 room
 temperature
 to
 1000 ◦C,
 under
same
 helium
 ﬂow.
 Oxygen
 in
 the
 reactor
 outlet
 was
 detected
 by
using
 a
 quadrupolar
 mass
 spectrometer;
 A
 TCD
 was
 used
 for
 the
quantiﬁcation
 of
 the
 oxygen.
 The
 amount
 of
 O2 desorbed
 from
 the
catalysts
 was
 quantiﬁed
 by
 calibrating
 the
 peak
 area
 against
 that
of
 a
 standard
 O2 pulse
 (50.0
 L).

 Catalytic
 activity
 measurement
The
 methane
 combustion
 activities
 were
 tested
 in
 a
 ﬁxed-bed
quartz
 reactor
 (i.d.
 8
 mm)
 containing
 250
 mg
 catalyst.
 Operating
conditions
 were
 as
 follows:
 2000
 ppm
 CH4,
 10
 vol.%
 O2,
 and
 N2
as
 the
 balance
 gas,
 with
 a
 total
 ﬂow
 rate
 of
 150
 mL/min,
 corre-
sponding
 to
 a
 GHSV
 about
 36,000
 mL  h−1 g−1.
 The
 range
 of
 test
temperature
 was
 250 ◦C
 to
 600 ◦C.
 The
 concentration
 of
 CH4 in
inlet
 and
 outlet
 gases
 was
 measured
 by
 an
 on-line
 gas
 chromato-
graph
 (Agilent
 7890A)
 equipped
 with
 FID
 and
 TCD
 detectors.
 The
activities
 were
 evaluated
 in
 terms
 of
 CH4 conversion
 deﬁned
 as
(cin −
 cout)/cin ×
 100%,
 cin and
 cout being
 methane
 concentration
corresponding
 to
 the
 inlet
 and
 outlet,
 respectively.
 Activity
 data
were
 collected
 at
 every
 measurement
 points
 after
 stabilizing
 for
30
 min.

 The
 Co–Cr

 sample
 was
in
 a
 combined
 phases
 of
 cubic
 spinel-type
 CoCr2O4 (JCPDS
 22-1084)
and
 rhombic
 Cr2O3 (JCPDS
 6-0504).
 With
 the
 doping
 of
 cerium,
 the
intensity
 of
 chromic
 oxide
 decreased.
 For
 higher
 degree
 of
 cerium
substitution
 (x
 ≥
 10%),
 diffraction
 lines
 corresponding
 to
 cubic
 CeO2
(JCPDS
 43-1002)
 were
 observed.
The
 Raman
 spectra
 of
 Ce
 doped
 cobalt
 chromite
 catalysts
 are
compiled
 in
 Fig.
 2.
 As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 2,
 the
 CoCr2O4 (sample
 a)
 spec-
trum
 shows
 bands
 at
 190,
 301,
 342,
 512,
 ∼540,
 ∼560,
 ∼600,
 and
671
 cm−1.
 The
 bands
 at
 301,
 342,
 ∼540
 and
 ∼600
 cm−1 correspond
to
 the
 vibration
 bands
 of
 Cr2O3 [20,21],  and
 the
 other
 bands
 at
190,
 445,
 512,
 ∼560
 and
 671
 cm−1 correspond
 to
 cobalt
 chromite
[22].
 Compared
 to
 the
 Raman
 spectrum
 of
 CoCr2O4,
 the
 Raman
spectra
 of
 the
 cerium
 doped
 samples
 changed
 a
 lot.
 For
 Raman
spectrum
 of
 sample
 (b),
 the
 intensity
 of
 Raman
 band
 at
 ∼540
 cm−1
decreased
 but
 the
 intensity
 of
 band
 at
 512
 cm−1 increased
 evidently
compared
 with
 the
 spectrum
 of
 sample
 (a).
 For
 sample
 (c)
 and
(d),
 the
 Raman
 band
 at
 512
 cm−1 prevailed,
 and
 the
 weak
 band
 at
461
 cm−1 appeared
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 which
 is
 characteristic
 band
of
 CeO2 [23,24]. For
 sample
 (e)
 and

 the
 Raman
 band

the
 chromium

 stretching
 vibration
 became
 dominated.
 The
variation
 observed
 in
 Raman
 spectra
 might
 suggest
 that
 the
 defor-
mation
 of
 spinel
 structure
 might
 occur
 in
 the
 process
 of
 cerium
substitution.
 It
 has
 been
 reported
 that
 deformation
 favors
 oxy-
gen
 mobility,
 affecting
 the
 redox
 behavior
 of
 the
 material
 [15].
Furthermore,
 the
 Raman
 spectrum
 of
 sample
 (g)
 shows
 the
 typ-
ical
 spectra
 of
 Co3O4 and
 CeO2.
 The
 Raman
 bands
 pertaining
 to
the
 Co3O4 appear
 at
 195,
 481,
 520,
 620,
 and
 689
 cm−1,
 whereas
ceria
 exhibits
 peaks
 at
 236,
 and
 462
 cm−1,
 which
 are
 in
 agreement
with
 the
 literatures
 [23,25,26].  In
 addition,
 it’s
 worthy
 to
 note
 that
Raman
 band
 at
 461
 cm−1 were
 observed
 for
 all
 cerium-containing
samples
 but
 shifted
 to
 higher-wavenumber
 positions
 with
 increas-
ing
 cerium
 substitution
 degree.
 The
 narrowing
 and
 the
 blue-shift
 of
the
 Raman
 bands
 indicate
 that
 the
 size
 of
 ceria
 particles
 increased
with
 the
 increment
 of
 cerium
 content.
The
 values
 of
 BET
 surface
 area
 and
 pore
 parameters
 are
 pre-
sented
 in
 Table
 1.
 Results
 indicate
 that
 BET
 surface
 areas
 and
 pore
volumes
 increased
 ﬁrst
 then
 decreased
 with
 the
 increment
 of
 Ce
content.
 5%
 Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalysts
 had
 the
 largest
 surface
 area
and
 pore
 volume,
 which
 would
 beneﬁt
 the
 catalytic
 performance
towards
 methane
 oxidation.
 Signiﬁcantly
 the
 surface
 area
 and
 pore
volumes
 were
 rather
 small
 for
 50%
 Ce
 and
 Co–Ce
 catalysts.
 This
may  be
 caused
 by
 agglomeration
 and
 sintering
 of
 CeO2 particles
(as
 detected
 by
 SEM,
 Fig.
 3),
 which
 is
 consistent
 with
 the
 Raman
results.

 CH4 TPR-MS
 and
 O2-TPD
 results
The
 CH4 activation
 over
 CoCr2O4 and
 Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalysts
 was
investigated
 via
 TPR-MS.
 The
 evolution
 of
 CO2 and
 CO
 during
 CH4
TPR-MS
 is
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 4,
 and
 the
 evolution
 of
 all
 gases
 (includ-
ing
 CO,
 CO2,
 CH4,
 H2O
 and
 H2)
 during
 CH4TPR-MS
 tests
 over
 5%
Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalyst
 is
 also
 displayed
 in
 Fig.
 5.
 For
 5%
 Ce
 modiﬁed
catalyst,
 the
 initial
 temperature
 of
 CH4 activation
 was
 nearly
 the
same
 with
 that
 of
 CoCr2O4,
 but
 the
 amount
 of
 CH4 that
 is
 activated
increased
 signiﬁcantly.
 For
 20%
 and
 50%
 Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalysts,
 the
activation
 temperature
 shift
 to
 higher
 temperatures.
 A
 similar
 phe-
nomenon
 can
 be
 observed
 in
 the
 activation
 of
 CH4 to
 CO
 during
 CH4
TPR-MS
 (Fig.
 4(B)).
 The
 5%
 Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalyst
 had
 the
 lowest
 ini-
tial
 temperature
 of
 CH4 activation
 to
 CO
 and
 the
 largest
 amount
 of
CH4 activated.
 Therefore,
 the
 CH4 activation
 follows
 the
 order
 5%
Ce
 >
 Co–Cr
 >
 20%
 Ce
 >
 50%
 Ce.
 This
 happens
 because
 the
 presence
of
 Ce
 deformed
 the
 structure
 (as
 stated
 above),
 and
 then
 a
 large
number
 of
 defects
 might
 be
 formed
 during
 this
 process,
 result-
ing
 in
 numerous
 sites
 with
 unsaturated
 coordination.
 Since
 CH4
can
 be
 more
 easily
 adsorbed
 on
 the
 unsaturated
 sites
 with
 numer-
ous
 defects
 than
 on
 a
 crystal
 with
 fewer
 defects,
 its
 activation
 is
facilitated
 by
 the
 former
 catalyst.
 Consequently
 the
 deformations
caused
 by
 Ce
 substitution
 favor
 CH4 activation
 and
 then
 enhance
the
 reducibility
 of
 the
 catalysts.
A
 complete
 analysis
 of
 all
 the
 gases
 evolving
 during
 CH4
TPR-MS
 experiments
 gives
 important
 hints
 on
 the
 processes
 tak-
ing
 place
 in
 the
 course
 of
 the
 test.

 The

 was
 observed
 for

 [11,13]. The
 results
 of
 O2-TPD
 are
presented
 in
 Table

 Substitution
 of
 chromium
 with
 cerium
 gave
rise
 to
 an
 increase
 of
 the
 amount
 of
 released
 oxygen,
 especially
 the
-oxygen.
 The
 5%
 Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalyst
 got
 the
 largest
 amount
 of
oxygen
 desorbed
 and
 also
 the
 largest
 -type
 oxygen.
 It
 may
 indicate
that
 the
 5%
 Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalyst
 has
 better
 reducibility
 and
 oxy-
gen
 mobility,
 which
 would
 play
 a
 major
 role
 in
 methane
 oxidation
[33].
 Furthermore,
 the
 oxygen
 desorption
 behavior
 of
 the
 Co–Ce
catalyst
 was
 different
 from
 these
 of
 other
 catalysts.
 The
 -oxygen
was
 not
 observed,
 and
 a
 sharp
 -peak
 appeared
 in
 the
 temperature
range
 between
 750 ◦C
 and
 850 ◦C.
 The
 -peak
 may
 be
 attributed
 to
partial
 reduction
 of
 CeO2 to
 Ce2O3 (4CeO2 →
 2Ce2O3 +
 O2).
 Accord-
ingly,
 the
 promotional
 effect
 of
 Ce
 to
 -oxygen
 may
 be
 due
 to
 the
decomposing
 of
 ceria
 at
 high
 temperature.

 are

3d
 spectra
 and
 surface

 for
 the

 are
 compiled
in
 Table

As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 7(A),
 the
 intense
 main
 oxygen
 peaks
 have
shoulders
 at
 higher
 binding
 energies,
 which
 can
 be
 resolved
 into
two
 components
 with
 peaks
 around
 531.5
 and
 530.1
 eV,
 respec-
tively,
 as
 reported
 in
 literatures
 [1,2,34].
 The
 two
 peaks
 of
 O
 1s
 are
distinguished
 as
 OI and
 OII,
 while
 OI has
 a
 binding
 energy
 about
1.4
 eV
 higher
 than
 that
 of
 OII. The
 OI peaks
 can
 be
 associated
 with
adsorption
 of
 oxygen
 species
 at
 the
 surface
 [1,34,35],
 while
 the
 low
binding
 energy
 of
 OII could
 be
 ascribed
 to
 lattice
 oxygen
 [2,35].
 Area
ratio
 of
 OI/OII could
 be
 a
 yardstick
 to
 measure
 the
 proportion
 of
 the
two
 different
 oxygen
 species,
 thus
 higher
 area
 ratio
 indicates
 larger
amount
 of
 vacant
 oxygen
 [1].  It
 can
 be
 seen

 and
 the
 largest

In
 Fig.
 7(B),
 the
 multiplex
 spectra
 of
 cobalt
 on
 four
 samples
 are
shown.
 The
 spectra
 were
 ﬁtted
 with
 the
 Co2+ and
 Co3+ components,
characterized
 by
 the
 binding
 energy
 at
 about
 781.7
 ±
 0.1
 eV
 and
780.3
 ±
 0.4
 eV,
 as
 reported
 in
 literatures
 [12,36,37].  The
 presence
 of
the
 satellite
 peaks
 at
 about
 6
 eV
 from
 the
 high
 energy
 component
 is
a
 further
 evidence
 for
 Co2+ species
 [38,39].
 The
 relative
 percentage
of
 the
 two
 cobalt
 species
 was
 obtained
 by
 the
 intensity
 of
 the
 Co
2p3/2 components
 in
 terms
 of
 Co2+ and
 Co3+.
 The
 binding
 energy
of
 Co
 2p3/2 and
 Co3+/(Co3+ +
 Co2+)
 atomic
 ratio
 are
 summarized
 in
Table
 3.
 Interestingly,
 the
 atomic
 ratio
 of
 Co3+ decreased
 ﬁrst
 and
then
 increased
 as
 the
 content
 of
 cerium
 increased.
The
 Cr
 2p3/2 spectra
 (Fig.
 7(C))
 show
 a
 clear
 asymmetry
 and
 are
resolved
 into
 two
 peaks
 with
 maxima
 at
 576.3
 and
 578.2
 eV.
 The
peaks
 were
 assigned
 to
 Cr3+ and
 Cr6+ [10,12,40],
 respectively.
 The
binding
 energies
 of
 Cr
 2p3/2 spectra
 and
 surface
 atomic
 ratios
 of
Cr6+ are
 summarized
 in
 Table
 3.
 The
 relative
 percentage
 of
 Cr6+ was
estimated
 to
 be
 0.33
 for
 CoCr2O4,
 and
 for
 5%
 Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalyst,
the
 relative
 percentage
 of
 Cr6+ was
 0.31,
 which
 was
 slightly
 lower
than
 that
 of
 CoCr2O4.
 However,
 the
 percentage
 of
 Cr6+ for
 20%
 and
50%
 modiﬁed
 catalyst
 was
 higher
 than
 that
 for
 CoCr2O4.
In
 Fig.
 7(D),
 the
 Ce
 3d
 spectra
 of
 5%,
 20%
 and
 50%
 Ce
 modiﬁed
catalysts
 are
 shown.
 The
 curves
 were
 ﬁtted
 with
 eight
 peaks
 corre-
sponding
 to
 four
 pairs
 of
 spin–orbit
 doublets.
 The
 bands
 labeled
 U1
and
 V1
 represent
 the
 3d104f1 initial
 electronic
 state
 corresponding
to
 Ce3+,
 while
 the
 peaks
 labeled
 U,
 U2,
 U3,
 V,
 V2
 and
 V3
 represent
the
 3d104f0 state
 of
 Ce4+ ions
 [38,41,42].
 The
 relative
 percentage
 of
the
 two
 cerium
 species
 was
 obtained
 by
 the
 intensity
 of
 the
 Ce
3d5/2 components
 relative
 to
 Ce4+ (V,
 V2,

 and
 to
 Ce3+ (V1).

 corresponding

about

 mL
 h−1 g−1.
In
 Table
 3,
 the
 atomic
 ratios
 of
 Ce3+/(Ce3+ +
 Ce4+)
 and
 Ce/Co
 are
reported.
 Although
 it
 is
 well
 documented
 that
 ceria
 can
 be
 partial
reduced
 during
 XPS
 characterization
 [38,41],  we
 cannot
 exclude
 the
possibility
 that
 Ce3+ exists
 at
 the
 surface.
 By
 comparing
 the
 Ce/Co
atomic
 ratio
 of
 50%
 Ce
 sample
 with
 that
 of
 5%
 Ce
 and
 20%
 Ce
 sam-
ples,
 cerium
 enrichment
 of
 the
 surface
 was
 observed
 upon
 samples
with
 higher
 substitution
 degree.
It
 is
 interesting
 to
 note
 that
 the
 relative
 percentage
 of
 Co3+ and
Cr6+ for
 5%
 Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalyst
 was
 lower
 than
 that
 of
 CoCr2O4
catalyst.
 This
 is
 possibly
 because
 charge
 compensating
 occurs
 so
as
 to
 maintain
 charge
 balance
 when
 a
 foreign
 cation
 with
 different
oxidation
 state
 was
 introduced
 into
 the
 system.
 The
 normal
 oxida-
tion
 state
 of
 cerium
 is
 +4,
 which
 is
 higher
 than
 normal
 valence
 of
cobalt
 and
 chromium
 in
 spinel
 lattice,
 so
 electroneutrality
 can
 be
achieved
 either
 by
 formation
 of
 oxygen
 vacancies
 or
 by
 lowering
the
 oxidation
 state
 of
 cobalt
 and/or
 chromium.
 Therefore,
 the
 per-
centage
 of
 Co3+ and
 Cr6+ of
 5%
 Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalyst
 was
 lower
 than
that
 of
 CoCr2O4.
3.2.
 Catalytic
 activity
 for
 methane
 combustion
The
 catalytic
 activities
 were
 evaluated
 towards
 methane
 com-
bustion,
 and
 the
 results
 are
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 8.
 The
 catalytic
 tests
indicate
 that,
 in
 the
 temperature
 range
 investigated,
 all
 the
 cata-
lysts
 show
 100%
 selectivity
 towards
 CO2,
 and
 no
 CO
 was
 observed
during
 the
 reaction.
 As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 8,
 substitution
 of
 Cr
 with
appropriate
 amount
 of
 Ce
 promoted
 the
 catalytic
 activity
 of
 the
catalysts.
 However,
 large
 amount
 of
 Ce
 substitution
 reduced
 the
activity,
 especially
 for
 samples
 with
 substitution
 degree
 higher
than
 20%.
 The
 2%,
 5%
 and
 10%
 Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalysts
 all
 had
 bet-
ter
 methane
 conversion
 than
 the
 undoped
 catalyst.
 The
 highest
methane
 conversion
 was
 obtained
 over
 5%
 Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalysts,
and
 the
 T90 (the
 temperature
 needed
 to
 reach
 90%
 methane
 con-
version)
 was
 as
 low
 as
 465 ◦C.
 The
 lowest
 methane
 conversion
 was
found
 over
 Co–Ce
 catalyst.
 In
 summary,
 if
 T90 was
 set
 as
 standard
of
 activity,
 the
 descending
 order
 of
 activity
 for
 all
 the
 observed
 cat-
alysts
 was
 as
 follows:
 5%
 Ce
 >
 2%
 Ce
 >
 10%
 Ce
 >
 Co–Cr
 >
 20%
 Ce
 >
 50%

 >

It
 is
 interesting
 to
 note
 that
 the
 sequence
 of
 catalytic
 activity
consistent
 with
 the
 sequence
 of
 CH4 activation
 obtained
 from
 the
CH4 TPR-MS
 tests
 and
 the
 temperature
 at
 which
 CH4 oxidation
began
 was
 very
 close
 to
 the
 initial
 temperature
 of
 CH4 activation
(Figs.
 4
 and
 8).
 So
 it
 is
 plausible
 to
 suggest
 CH4 adsorption
 and
even
 activation
 on
 the
 catalyst
 may
 be
 a
 necessary
 and
 rate-limiting
step
 in
 methane
 oxidation
 reaction,
 as
 reported
 in
 the
 literatures
[43,44].
 The
 main
 difference
 between
 CH4 TPR-MS
 investigations
and
 activity
 tests
 lies
 on
 the
 availability
 of
 oxygen
 resources
 dur-
ing
 the
 adsorption
 and
 activation
 of
 CH4.
 For
 CH4 TPR-MS
 tests
(absence
 of
 added
 oxidant),
 the
 oxygen
 resources
 were
 lattice
 oxy-
gen
 and
 adsorbed
 active
 oxygen
 at
 the
 surface
 at
 low
 temperature,
but
 at
 higher
 temperature,
 the
 oxygen
 may
 origin
 from
 the
 bulk
oxygen,
 whose
 rate
 is
 affected
 by
 the
 low
 diffusion
 of
 the
 oxygen
towards
 the
 surface.
 However,
 during
 the
 activity
 tests,
 methane
adsorption
 is
 required,
 but
 the
 activation
 products
 of
 methane
 can
be
 rapidly
 and
 completely
 oxidized
 into
 carbon
 dioxide
 and
 water.
Simultaneously,
 the
 lattice
 oxygen
 consumed
 at
 the
 surface
 would
be
 quickly
 replenished
 and
 reach
 equilibrium
 with
 gas
 phase
 oxy-
gen.
 So
 the
 temperature
 at
 which
 the
 optimum
 activity
 was
 attained
was
 lower
 than
 that
 of
 CH4 TPR-MS
 tests
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 oxygen.
The
 T90 of
 Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalysts
 decreased
 ﬁrst
 and
 then
increased
 as
 the
 Ce
 content
 increased
 with
 the
 lowest
 result
 for
 5%
Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalyst.
 Interestingly,
 the
 change
 trends
 of
 the
 rela-
tively
 percentage
 of
 Co3+ and
 Cr6+ at
 the
 surface
 (Table
 3)
 seem
 to
 be
the
 same
 with
 that
 of
 T90. It
 may
 indicate
 that
 charge
 compensating
occurs
 during
 the
 process
 of
 Ce
 substitution,
 and
 the
 redistribution
of
 metal
 ions
 at
 the
 surface
 would
 inﬂuence
 the
 catalytic
 activ-
ity
 towards
 methane
 oxidation.
 Furthermore,
 from
 the
 results
 of
O2-TPD
 and
 XPS,
 one
 can
 observe
 that
 the
 5%
 Ce
 modiﬁed
 catalyst
has
 relatively
 larger
 concentration
 of
 oxygen
 vacancies
 and
 more
adsorbed
 oxygen,
 which
 may
 favor
 the
 adsorption,
 activation
 and
then
 oxidation
 of
 CH4.
For
 higher
 substitution
 degree,
 ceria
 enriched
 and
 sintered
 at
the
 surface
 (Figs.
 1–3),  resulting
 in
 lower
 surface
 area,
 thus
 leading
to
 the
 decline
 of
 the
 catalytic
 activity.

 Conclusions
Substitution
 of
 chromium
 in
 CoCr2O4 by
 cerium
 with
 appropri-
ate
 amount
 can
 enhance
 the
 catalytic
 activity
 of
 cobalt
 chromite
in
 methane
 combustion.
 The
 best
 result
 has
 been
 attained
 with
 5%
cerium
 modiﬁed
 catalyst,
 and
 the
 catalytic
 activity
 reached
 90%
of
 methane
 conversion
 at
 465 ◦C.
 This
 improvement
 is
 related
 to
structure
 deformation
 caused
 in
 the
 process
 of
 substitution;
 con-
sequently,
 it
 would
 increase
 crystal
 defects
 and
 oxygen
 vacancy
concentration,
 which
 facilitate
 oxygen
 mobility
 and
 thus
 increase
the
 catalytic
 performance
 of
 cerium
 modiﬁed
 cobalt
 chromite
 cat-
alysts.
