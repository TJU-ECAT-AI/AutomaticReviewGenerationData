I Abstract
Atoms and small molecules react with transition metal clusters in ways
that are analogous to the physisorption and chemisorption reactions observed on the
corresponding extended metal surface. However, often underlying these similarities are
size-dependent variations in the reaction mechanisms and rates, the interpretation of
which requires a detailed understanding of the structures of both the bare metal cluster
substrates and the cluster-molecule complexes. Although polyatomic transition metal
clusters cannot be characterized by the traditional methods of molecular spectroscopy,
thecombinationofotherphysicalandchemicalprobescanprovidequalitativeandsemi-
quantitative structural information. These techniques, when combined with equilib-
rium geometries calculated using ab initio or semiempirical methods, provide a detailed
picture of the structural origin of metal cluster reactivity and its variation with size.
INTRODUCTION
Over the past 20 years, the techniques of modern surface science have yielded a
great body of detailed information regarding the adsorption of atoms and molecules
on single crystal transition metal surfaces (1–3). Such studies of chemistry in two
dimensions have been invaluable in determining the complex reaction mechanisms
relevant to many heterogeneous catalytic processes. In 1981, Richard Smalley and
his coworkers reported a novel laser vaporization method of producing bare metal
and semiconductor clusters that in many ways behaved like nanometer-sized sur-
faces (4). Soon after its development, this method was being used in many labora-
tories to produce clusters composed of transition metals, as well as semimetals and
semiconductors, allowing investigation of their size-speciﬁc physical and chem-
ical behavior under isolated conditions. Clusters of transition metal atoms, Mn,
were found to exhibit particularly rich chemistry, reacting readily with a variety of

small molecules in ways that, broadly speaking, were analogous to the chemisorp-
tion reactions observed on the corresponding bulk metal surfaces. However, closer
examination revealed that the rates and mechanisms of cluster-molecule reactions
often varied signiﬁcantly with cluster size, demonstrating that these species are not
simply small pieces of the bulk metal, but rather distinct species whose structure
and properties change dramatically from one size to the next (5–10). The cluster-
surface analogy quickly became apparent from the reactivity surveys of the 1980s,
and the phrase molecular surface science was coined to describe this new approach
to the study of metal-molecule chemisorption reactions (6, 7, 9).
As in conventional surface chemistry studies, the goals in studying metal cluster
reactions are to determine the mechanisms, rates, and energetics of adsorption and
to understand how these attributes depend on the structures of the underlying bare
cluster substrates. However, until relatively recently, interpretation of metal cluster
reactivity experiments has been hampered by the lack of structural information,
both for the bare cluster substrates and for the product complexes. Fortunately, ad-
vances in theoretical and experimental methods have enabled signiﬁcant progress
to be made toward solving the general problem of cluster structure determination.
The focus of this review is to summarize the current state of the molecular surface
science of transition metal clusters. Earlier reviews of transition metal clusters and
their gas-phase reactions can be found elsewhere (6–11). In this review, emphasis
is given to recent results in which experiment and theory have been combined
to reveal the structural origin of size effects observed in rates of cluster-molecule
reactions; emphasis is also given to the structures of the resulting cluster-adsorbate
complexes. The scope of this review is limited to gas-phase reactions of transi-
tion metal clusters with atoms and small molecules and concentrates mainly on
reactions of neutral clusters. The study of transition metal ions M+
n and M−
n and
their chemistry is an active ﬁeld in its own right, and although the experimental
techniques are different from those used to study neutral clusters, it is generally ob-
served that charged clusters display the same reaction channels as are displayed by
the corresponding neutral clusters (12–14). Reviews of transition metal cluster ion
chemistry can be found elsewhere (10, 15). Recent studies describing interesting
“sandwich” and layered cluster structures produced via the reaction of transition
metal atoms with C60 and benzene are not reviewed here; instead, the reader is re-
ferred to the original literature (16–21). Finally, the deﬁnition of a transition metal
is expanded for the purpose of this review to include the coinage metals—copper,
silver, and gold.
CHARACTERIZING THE SUBSTRATE: The Determination
of Metal Cluster Structure
Although a comprehensive discussion of the determination of metal cluster struc-
ture is beyond the scope of this review, an introductory overview is in order, given
the central role of structure in determining reactivity. The task of determining

transition metal cluster structure has proven to be enormously difﬁcult because of
the size and complexity of these species. Laser-based spectroscopic techniques
are capable of yielding structural information only for very small clusters. Res-
onant two-photon ionization spectroscopy has provided spectroscopic constants
for a number of transition metal dimers (22), whereas zero electron kinetic energy
photoelectron spectroscopy has been used to obtain structures for species contain-
ing up to three metal atoms, such as Nb3C2 (23), Y3C2 (24), Nb3O (25), and their
cations. Raman spectroscopy has recently been used to determine the structures of
small, matrix-isolated silver clusters (26) up to Ag5. However, because of compli-
cations resulting from large numbers of vibrational degrees of freedom, low-lying
electronic states, and the resulting nonadiabatic behavior, these and other tradi-
tional techniques of molecular spectroscopy are ineffective in characterizing larger
metal clusters. As a result, structural information for larger metal clusters is usu-
ally obtained indirectly, using characteristic patterns in their physical or chemical
behavior to infer their geometries.
One such approach is the chemical probe technique developed by Riley &
Parks (27–29). This approach essentially turns the structure-reactivity problem
around, using probe molecules to saturate the adsorption sites on the surface of the
clusters such that the number of sites can be determined. This information is used
in conjunction with a set of empirical binding rules to choose from among a set of
reasonablecandidatesforagivenclusteralikelystructurewiththerequisitenumber
of binding sites. The structures of small nickel and cobalt clusters determined in
this way are shown in Figure 1, in this case probed by the adsorption of nitrogen
and ammonia. Although not providing absolute proof of cluster structures, this
type of experiment is one of the most useful structural tools available for metal
cluster structure determination, particularly for larger clusters where spectroscopic
probes are not applicable.
Because of the large number of electrons and the open d-shells of the constituent
atoms, calculation of the stable structures of polyatomic transition metal clusters
has proven to be among the most difﬁcult problems in quantum chemistry. Until
recently, the complexity (and computational difﬁculty) of the problem dictated
the use of less-accurate methods, such as the Hartree-Fock (30), extended H¨
uckel
(31, 32), and Xα-scattered wave (32, 33) approaches. Although these methods can
provide useful qualitative information and identify trends, they are of insufﬁcient
accuracy to reliably predict geometric structures or physical properties. However,
recent advances in both electronic structure methodology and computational per-
formance have permitted structures to be calculated accurately with reasonable
effort, enabling searches for global minima and low-lying isomers for clusters
containing up to eight or ten transition metal atoms. Density-functional theory
has emerged as a particularly promising approach, possessing both the necessary
accuracy and computational efﬁciency (34–38). Density-functional theory calcu-
lations of small nickel (35) and cobalt (35, 38) clusters, for example, ﬁnd ground
state structures that are generally in accord with the experimentally determined
structures shown in Figure 1.

For clusters containing more than approximately 10 metal atoms, the use of
high-level electronic structure methods is precluded because of prohibitive com-
putational demands. However, for certain metals for which reliable semiempir-
ical potentials are available, such as nickel and the coinage metals, molecular
dynamics- and gradient-based methods can be used to obtain stable structures for
much larger clusters than can be currently studied by ab initio methods. Although
not as accurate as state-of-the-art electronic structure methods, these methods are
capable of yielding properties and geometric structures that are largely insensitive
to the details of the potential. Nickel clusters have been extensively studied by such
techniques (39–51), driven in part by the availability of both accurate potentials
and a signiﬁcant body of experimental data to which the results can be compared.
The lowest-energy structures obtained for small nickel clusters (39–42, 45–47) are
generally in accord with those experimentally determined (52–56) by the chemical
probe method (Figure 1).
Often, even the “best” calculations are of insufﬁcient accuracy to predict reli-
ably the energetic ordering among a set of close-lying isomers. In such cases, it
is sometimes possible to identify the lowest-energy isomer among several candi-
dates by comparing one or more experimentally determined properties with those
predicted theoretically. Cluster attributes that are amenable to both calculation
and accurate measurement include their physical properties, such as ionization
potential and electron afﬁnity, as well as their spectroscopic signatures provided
by photoelectron spectra, optical absorption spectra, and vibrational spectra. For
example, ground state geometries of neutral iron (57) and niobium clusters (37)
were identiﬁed by comparing the characteristic shapes of the photodetachment
spectra of their corresponding anions with simulations based on the distribution
of excited electronic states calculated for the corresponding neutral clusters.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES
Kinetics and Reactive Scattering
The gas-phase production of bare transition metal clusters is most often accom-
plished by using a pulsed laser vaporization source similar to that originally de-
scribed by Smalley and coworkers (4, 58). This method of cluster production has
the advantage of being completely general, allowing the generation of neutral
or charged clusters from virtually any solid element. Because only a minuscule
amount of metal is evaporated with each laser pulse, targets consisting of rare or
isotopically enriched metals can be used at reasonable cost. In addition, this type of
source can be coupled to a wide variety of apparati suited to cluster reactivity stud-
ies, such as ﬂow-tube reactors, beam-gas reactive scattering cells, and (for charged
clusters) ion cyclotron resonance spectrometers (59) and ion drift cells (60, 61).
The elementary reactions of neutral metal clusters can be studied either within
a ﬂow-tube reactor coupled directly to the cluster source or, after expansion of

the clusters into vacuum, within a secondary low-pressure cell in a beam-gas
experiment. Of these two approaches, the ﬂow-tube (or fast-ﬂow) reactor is more
commonly used. In this setup, the reactant gas A is added to the carrier gas stream
containing the formed clusters prior to their expansion into vacuum. The energy
released in the Mn + A reaction produces an internally excited complex that, unless
stabilized by a third body collision with the carrier gas atom C, will eventually
dissociate:

Invoking the steady state assumption for [Mn A]∗, the reaction rate coefﬁcient, kr,
describing the depletion of Mn (and the appearance of Mn A) is predicted to vary
with the concentration [C ] (or, equivalently, pressure) of the carrier gas according
to
kr =
k0[C]

,
3.
where k0 = kaks/kd is the termolecular rate coefﬁcient. In the high-pressure
limit (i.e. as [C] →∞), virtually every nascent complex Mn A∗is stabilized,
such that kr →ka. From a practical standpoint, the carrier gas pressures (1–
100 Torr) used in typical ﬂow-tube cluster reactors are usually sufﬁcient to ensure
that reactions occur in this bimolecular regime. Of course, the mechanism given by
Equations 1 and 2 comprises the simplest case and does not include the possibility
of other energetically allowed unimolecular reactions that may occur in parallel
with simple desorption of the reactant A.
Evenatthelowestreactantgasﬂows, thereactantconcentration[A]isessentially
constant and greatly exceeds that of the clusters [Mn]. In this case, the methods
of pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetics can be used to evaluate the reactive rate coefﬁcient
kr from the depletion of bare cluster signal in the mass spectrum as a function of
[A]:
[Mn] = [Mn]0e−kr[A]τ.

In Equation 4, τ is the effective contact time of the clusters with the reagent within
the ﬂow tube, and [Mn]0 is the initial metal cluster concentration at τ = 0.
The reactant gas concentrations are typically chosen so that the number of
reactive collisions (which heat the cluster) are greatly exceeded by the number
of cooling collisions with the carrier gas. In this way it can be ensured that the
reaction products are stabilized and that the cluster-molecule reactions occur at a
constant temperature. It should be noted, however, that it is sometimes desirable
to conduct reactions at the opposite extreme, under high-temperature, reagent-rich
conditions favoring the production of metastable products, an example of which is

the met-car family of metal-carbon clusters (62, 63). In the absence of stabilizing
collisions, the total exothermicity of sequential cluster-molecule reactions can be
so high that the product complexes emit blackbody radiation extending into the
visible region, as demonstrated for reactions of niobium clusters with oxygen by
Frenzel et al (64).
Although the beam-gas method for studying elementary chemical reactions is
well established and has been used to study the reactions of size-selected metal
cluster ions (60, 61), its adaptation to the study of reactions involving neutral metal
clusters is fairly recent (65). In this approach, a molecular beam of clusters passes
through a differentially pumped gas cell, containing 0.1–1 Torr of reactant gas,
where nonreactive and reactive collisions occur. By measuring the depletion of
bare clusters Mn and the appearance of association products Mn A, Mn A2, etc,
as a function of reactant gas pressure PA, sticking probabilities can be obtained
(65–72). In contrast to ﬂow-tube reactor experiments, which are conducted within
a constant-temperature helium bath, beam-gas experiments are conducted under
(nearly) single-collision conditions and are therefore better described as occurring
at constant total energy, given by the sum of the relative translational energy Etr
and the energy released by the chemisorption reaction 1Hchem. Both nonreactive
and reactive scattering effects can complicate the calculation of absolute cross
sections from measured sticking probabilities. First, simple nonreactive scattering
attenuates the signal both from unreacted bare clusters and adsorbate complexes;
however, this effect decreases smoothly with increasing cluster mass and can be
corrected to ﬁrst order through measurement of deﬂection probabilities with rare
gas collision partners (71). Second, the unimolecular dissociation of vibrationally
excited product complexes can be accompanied by sufﬁcient translational kinetic
energy release that some fraction of the products recoil from the molecular beam
prior to detection. Such fragmentation effects vary signiﬁcantly with cluster size
and are manifested by discontinuities in the otherwise smoothly decreasing depen-
dence of deﬂection probability on cluster size. The sticking probabilities measured
in beam-gas experiments complement the thermal rate constants by providing an
absolute probability for the primary encounter, a quantity that in ﬂow-tube ex-
periments is obscured by the effects of subsequent collisions. Furthermore, the
scattering and unimolecular dissociation phenomena, although complicating the
estimation of reactive cross sections, provides valuable kinematic information re-
garding the cluster-molecule collision that is unobservable in ﬂow-tube kinetics
experiments.
Product Detection and Characterization
Mass spectrometry in some form is used in essentially all gas-phase reactivity stud-
ies of neutral metal clusters, providing both size speciﬁcity and the high sensitivity
needed to detect the minute quantities of clusters produced. Laser photoioniza-
tion time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry is the most widely used method and has the

advantage that a large range of cluster sizes can be studied concurrently, thus re-
ducing data collection times. Fortunately, the ionization potentials of all but the
smallest transition metal clusters are low enough that they can be one-photon ion-
ized at one or more of the wavelengths provided by rare-gas halide excimer lasers
or by frequency up-converted dye lasers.
Qualitative information regarding the nature of cluster-adsorbate bonding can
be obtained through threshold photoionization efﬁciency spectra, obtained from
cluster photoion intensities measured as a function of photoionization wavelength.
Fromphotoionizationefﬁciencyspectra, smallshiftsinclusterionizationpotentials
(IPs) that accompany the adsorption of atoms or molecules can be measured,
and from the magnitude and direction of these shifts, a general picture of how
adsorbates are bound to the underlying cluster can be obtained.
More detailed information regarding the interaction of the adsorbate with the
cluster can be obtained from infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Extremely small sam-
ple densities preclude the direct measurement of IR absorption spectra; however,
IR photodissociation spectroscopy, a depletion technique, can be used to obtain
spectra even in the sparse samples contained in molecular beams (73–83). This is
a pump-probe technique in which multiphoton absorption of IR (pump) light by
the complex results in its dissociation. The pump laser-induced depletion of the
product complexes is monitored by time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (the probe).
The relative IR absorption cross sections σ are determined from measurements of
depletion D recorded as a function of laser frequency via D = 1 −e−σ F, where F
is the pump laser ﬂuence (76). Applications of both photoionization spectroscopy
and IR photodissociation spectroscopy in the characterization of various Mn + A
reaction products are discussed below.
REACTION RATES AND EQUILIBRIA
Activated Versus Facile Bimolecular Reactions
A general (but greatly simpliﬁed) model describing the physisorption and chemis-
orption of molecules onto metal surfaces is illustrated in Figure 2. This idealized
surface model is also useful in understanding the mechanisms of metal cluster-
molecule reactions. In general, the attractive cluster-molecule potential consists
of a long-range component, dominated by van der Waals forces that give rise to
physisorption and a shorter range but deeper potential well, characteristic of either
molecular or dissociative chemisorption. As illustrated in Figure 2a, facile ad-
sorption reactions occur on a purely attractive potential, with no activation barrier
separating the gas-phase reactants from the adsorbed products. In contrast, acti-
vated reactions (Figure 2b) possess an entrance channel barrier separating reactants
from chemisorbed products. However, the point at which the physical and chemical
potential surfaces cross can be below the zero of energy deﬁned by inﬁnite surface-
molecule separation (Figure 2c). In this case, the chemisorption reaction can occur

directly either via a facile, barrierless reaction or by a two-step mechanism in which
the reactant molecule becomes weakly physisorbed prior to undergoing activated
chemisorption. In general, activated reactions are dissociative in nature, involving
the breaking of intramolecular bonds and the formation of stronger bonds between
the resulting atoms or fragments and the metal surface, whereas facile reactions can
involve either molecular or dissociative chemisorption. A potential energy surface
describing chemisorption may have several minima, corresponding, for example,
to molecular adsorption followed by one or more decomposition steps. All other
factors being equal, because of presence of the activation barrier, activated surface
reactions are predicted to occur with lower probability per collision than do facile
reactions.
Extending this surface model to metal clusters, we can expect that the rates for
facile, irreversible adsorption reactions will exhibit little cluster-size dependence,
occurring with high probability regardless of the detailed structure of the substrate
cluster. An example of a facile reaction occurring near the gas kinetic rate is
provided by the Nbn + O2 reaction, the 300 K rate coefﬁcients (84) for which
are shown in Figure 3. It is generally observed that molecules possessing lone
pairs of electrons such as carbon monoxide, methanol, and ammonia react with
metal clusters via facile association reactions (9, 85). Physisorption of rare gas
atoms and molecules onto metal clusters, also facile reactions, are only observed at
relatively low temperatures because of the weak nature of the van der Waals forces
involved and (in the case of molecular adsorbates) because competing activated
chemisorption reactions are slowed.
In contrast, because of the discontinuous evolution of structures (and hence
activation barriers), Mn + A reactions possessing an activation barrier may be
expected to exhibit signiﬁcant reactivity variations from one cluster size to the
next. Dissociative Mn + H2 →MnHH reactions fall into this category, display-
ing rate coefﬁcients that are often signiﬁcantly less than the gas kinetic collision
rates and that vary over several orders of magnitude with cluster size. These reac-
tivity variations tend to be largest for clusters containing fewer than 20 atoms, as
demonstrated in Figure 3 for the Nbn + H2 and Nbn + N2 reactions (84). These
ﬂuctuations are due to the sudden variations in electronic and/or geometric struc-
tures that occur in this size range. For larger clusters, the variations in reactivity as
well as other properties become less pronounced as common structural motifs are
adopted. Metal cluster reactions with molecular nitrogen often display the same
size dependence as the corresponding Mn + H2 reactions, as illustrated in Figure 3
for Nbn + N2, although clusters of certain transition metals (such as nickel and
cobalt) react with N2 at room temperature and below to produce stable complexes
in which the nitrogen is molecularly—rather than dissociatively—chemisorbed
(54–56, 86, 87). This is discussed in more detail below.
Soon after survey studies revealed large cluster size variations in the rates of
Fen + H2 and Nbn + H2 reactions, Whetten et al (88–90) recognized a rough
correlation between cluster reactivity and IP. Speciﬁcally, it was noted that those
clusters having an unusually high IP compared with neighboring clusters also dis-
played low reactivity and vice versa. This correlation is demonstrated in Figure 3

which is discussed below. Based on the observed correlation, Whetten et al pro-
posed a simple electron transfer model, adapted from surface chemistry (91), in
which electron donation from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of
the metal cluster to the hydrogen σ ∗(antibonding) orbital was assumed to be the
rate-determining step in the reaction. Thus, it was reasoned, the higher the IP of a
cluster, the higher the activation barrier for reaction. However, noting that clusters
of other transition metals did not follow this IP-reactivity correlation (and iron
clusters only approximately), Concei¸
c˜
ao et al proposed a more reﬁned model (92).
These workers found that variations in the reactivities of iron, cobalt, and nickel
clusters with hydrogen correlated more convincingly to the difference between
cluster IP and electron afﬁnity (EA) than to IP alone (Figure 4). Speciﬁcally, they

postulated that the quantity Ep = IP −EA −e2/R (the last term proportional to
the classical charging energy of the cluster of radius R) was a ﬁrst order measure
of the energy required to promote an electron from the HOMO to the lowest un-
occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the cluster. The key assumption of this
model is that the activation barrier is due to Pauli repulsion between the valence
electrons of the incoming H2 molecule and the cluster HOMO; the energy required
to surmount this barrier is given to ﬁrst order by the HOMO →LUMO promo-
tion energy, Ep. Recently, Kietzmann et al determined the HOMO-LUMO gap of
Nbn (n = 6–17) directly from the photoelectron spectra of mass selected Nb−
n and
found a similar correlation between the HOMO-LUMO gap and reactivity toward
hydrogen (93). As shown in Figure 3, the size variation in the HOMO-LUMO gap
is strikingly similar to that displayed by Ep, computed according to the prescrip-
tion of Concei¸
c˜
ao et al (92) from niobium cluster ionization potentials (94) and
electron afﬁnities (93).
The ability of high-level electronic structure theory to describe the potential
energy surfaces governing activated reactions was recently demonstrated in a study
ofNbn + H2 andNbn + N2 reactions(84).ItwasobservedthatN2 andH2 reactwith
niobium clusters with essentially the same size dependence (Figure 3). Supporting
density-functional theory calculations were performed for the computationally
tractable model complexes, NbnH2 and NbnN2 (n = 1–3). In the lowest-lying
conﬁgurations of both Nb2H2 and Nb2N2 complexes, the H2 and N2 molecules
were fully dissociated, with the H and N atoms bound on opposite sides of Nb2 in
a perpendicular bridging conﬁguration. It is interesting that these same structural
moieties were observed as subunits in the lowest-lying states of Nb3H2 and Nb3N2
as well, with the additional Nb atom not directly participating in the Nb-H and Nb-
N bonding. In addition to predictions of stable minima and their energetic ordering,
total energies were computed along reaction coordinates identiﬁed as being the
mostenergeticallyfavorablepathsconnectingreactantsandproducts.Theresulting
family of diabatic potential energy curves (Figure 5) correlates to the various
electronic states of Nb2 and Nb3 in the limit of inﬁnite separation. For the Nb2 + N2
system, the lowest-lying bound states of Nb2N2 (all having C2v symmetry) were
found to correlate to three excited electronic states of Nb2, each having doubly
excited δ∗(a2)2 conﬁgurations, whereas the ground (3B1) state of Nb2 possessing a
ﬁlled σ(a1)2 bonding orbital was repulsive with respect to N2 addition. In contrast,
the 1A1 ground state of Nb2H2 correlated to very low-lying states of Nb2, each
involving different occupations of the degenerate δ(a1, b1) HOMO. Noting that the
geometric and electronic structures for Nb3H2 and Nb3N2 were similar to those
in the corresponding Nb2 complexes, B´
erces et al proposed that the Nb2 subunit
formed the reactive site for H2/N2 dissociative chemisorption in Nb3 as well as in
larger niobium clusters. A detailed charge-density analysis showed that the sudden
inﬂections in the potential energy curves signifying H-H and N-N bond rupture
(see Figure 5) were accompanied by a net transfer of electron density to the H and N
atoms, mediatedbyavoidedcrossingswithionic potentialsurfaces.Iftheactivation

barrier for dissociative chemisorption is assumed to be governed by this neutral →
ionic transition, the height of the barrier would be expected to be proportional to
cluster IP, giving rise to the IP-reactivity correlation ﬁrst noted by Whetten et al
(88, 90). Combining this assumption of charge transfer with the notion that Nb2
was the reactive site within the Nbn, B´

estimated by assuming that the formal positive charge resided on the Nb2 site that is
directly involved in the reaction rather than at the center of the cluster. IPeff displays
the same size dependence (as well as the same correlation to niobium cluster
reactivity) as is shown by the HOMO-LUMO gap and Ep (Figure 3); however,
the underlying physical basis for these similarities is not obvious. It should be
emphasizedthatthisIP-reactivitycorrelationandthecharge-transfermodelderived
from it is most compelling for the Nbn+H2/N2 case; no other Mn + H2/N2 system
studied to date displays this empirical relationship as clearly. Understanding the
underlying factors controlling dissociative chemisorption of H2/N2 reactivity for
other Mn species will require detailed case-by-case theoretical studies (95).
Precursor-Mediated Chemisorption
Although the rates of Mn + H2 and Mn + N2 reactions generally display the
dramatic size-dependence indicative of activated reactions, the rate coefﬁcients
actually measured are often found to decrease with increasing temperature, con-
trarytoexpectation.SuchbehaviorisdisplayedbyratecoefﬁcientsfortheWn + N2

is readily understood if the simple Mn + H2 →MnHH reaction mechanism

The involvement of physisorbed precursors in chemisorption reactions on macro-
scopic metal surfaces is well documented (1, 97). For dissociative Mn + H2/N2
reactions, the effective bimolecular rate coefﬁcient k′
r describing the reactive
depletion of Mn (the quantity experimentally measured via Equation 4) can be
expressed in terms of the individual elementary rate coefﬁcients ka, kd, and kc,

In Equation 7, Ac,d and Ec,d are the preexponential factors and activation energies,
respectively, for chemisorption (c) and desorption (d). Equation 7 predicts that k′
r
will decrease with -increasing temperature for cases where Ed > Ec (Figure 2c)
and increase with temperature when Ed < Ec (Figure 2b). For Mn + H2/N2 reac-
tions, rate coefﬁcients that increase with decreasing temperature appear to be the
rule rather than the exception and have been observed for reaction of hydrogen
with Nin (99), Con (100), and Nbn (84) and of nitrogen with Wn (96) and Mon
(98, 101). As written, Equation 7 predicts that for reactions in which Ed > Ec, k′
r
will decrease monotonically with increasing temperature. However, if ka is as-
sumed to vary as T1/2 as predicted by simple gas kinetic considerations, k′
r will
display a minimum at some temperature and increase with temperature thereafter.
Such an effect has been observed for the reactions of Nin and Con with hydrogen
(86, 99).
Holmgren et al studied the Wn + N2 reaction with the beam-gas technique (72)
and found that the measured sticking probabilities followed the same size variation
and temperature dependence as the rate coefﬁcients obtained in the ﬂow-tube
studies (96). As shown in Figure 6, the sticking probability for N2 onto cold (77 K)
clusters was found to be considerably larger than those obtained for 298 K clusters,
a result consistent with the involvement of a physisorbed precursor complex in the
overall chemisorption mechanism. The most convincing evidence concerning the
state of the adsorbed nitrogen within the products comes from photodissociation
experiments. As shown in Figure 6, a large fraction of the complexes produced
from the cold Wn clusters was signiﬁcantly depleted when irradiated with 308-nm
(XeCl) laser light, whereas those produced from room temperature clusters showed
little depletion under the same conditions. These results clearly show that all the
complexes produced from the room temperature clusters were strongly bound,
resulting from dissociative chemisorption, whereas a signiﬁcant fraction of the
complexes formed by reaction of cold clusters were weakly bound complexes in
which the N2 was molecularly adsorbed.
Further evidence supporting the involvement of precursors has been found in
the correspondence of metal cluster reactivity with H2/D2 and their propensity to
form complexes with rare gases. As shown in Figure 7, those Fen, Con, and Nin
clusters displaying the highest (lowest) reactivity toward hydrogen also formed

MnArm and MnKrm complexes with the greatest (smallest) efﬁciency. Because the
relative propensity among a series of Mn to form van der Waals complexes with
atoms or molecules in general will vary according to their polarizabilities, it is
reasonable to expect that the same size-dependent pattern observed for MnAr and
MnKr formation will also occur for the production of Mn(H2)m van der Waals com-
plexes. No such correlation was observed for niobium clusters, however, which
suggests that Nbn + H2 reactions may occur predominantly through a direct (rather
than precursor mediated) channel (84). But how does this notion of precursor com-
plexes controlling cluster reactivity ﬁt with the purely electronic model (92), which
also successfully accounts for Fen, Con, and Nin cluster reactivity toward hydro-
gen? The connection became clear when it was recognized (92) that, formally,
the polarizability α of a cluster is inversely proportional to the sum of virtual
electronic excitations, α ∼P
i(E0 −Ei)−1, in which E0 and Ei denote ground
and excited electronic state energies, respectively. Thus, those clusters having a
particular low (high) HOMO-LUMO gap are predicted to have anomalously high
(low) polarizabilities. Note that this model predicts that the HOMO-LUMO gap
will inﬂuence reactivity in two ways: directly, by determining the height of the
activation barrier, and indirectly, through determining probability of formation of
precursor complexes. That cluster polarizability plays a signiﬁcant role in deter-
mining the rates of precursor-mediated reactions was reinforced by Pedersen et al
in their recent kinetics study of the Wn + cyclo-C3H6 system (102).

cross sections calculated for the Ni13 + D2 reaction, calculated from molecular
dynamics by using a semiempirical potential, display enhancements (reactive reso-
nances) near zero relative translational energy, Etr. Examination of the trajectories
revealed that these resonances were due to the enhanced probability of formation
of a weakly bound complex in which the D2 molecule was physisorbed. Only after
the D2 molecule diffused on the cluster surface to ﬁnd the proper site did disso-
ciation occur. In contrast, a signiﬁcant fraction of the reactive events occurring at
higher Etr were direct in nature, but because of the more stringent steric require-
ments governing direct reactions, they display lower cross sections than those of
the precursor-mediated channel—the only channel open at low Etr.
Bimetallic Clusters
There has been increasing interest in studying the reactivity of bimetallic clusters,
motivated by the prospect of observing “promotion” or “poisoning” effects akin to
those observed in supported catalysts (107). The number of examples experimen-
tally examined thus far (108–115) is relatively small, limited in no small part by
the difﬁculties of mass spectrometrically resolving the myriad of products that can
occur given the statistical distribution of clusters M1

composed of metals M1 and M2. Accordingly, most of the systems investigated

to date were chosen speciﬁcally to minimize such complications, for example
through the use of monoisotopic metals that have favorable atomic mass ratios.
The majority of studies regarding the reactivity of transition metal-containing
bimetallic clusters have come from Kaya and coworkers (108–114) and focus pri-
marily on their reactivity toward hydrogen, because of the ability of this molecule
to serve as a sensitive probe of cluster geometric and electronic structure. Kinetics
studies of ConNan (112), ConAlm (108), NbnAlm (108), and ConVm (109) with H2
have revealed that the presence of a single heteroatom can alter the reactivity of a
cluster signiﬁcantly. For example, Co5V and Co7V are several times more reactive
than Co6 and Co8, whereas Co12V is less reactive toward hydrogen than is Co13
(109). Similarly, the incorporation of one to three aluminum atoms was found
to increase the reactivity of cobalt clusters and niobium clusters toward hydrogen
(108), whereas sodium atoms did not change (or slightly inhibited) cobalt cluster
reactivity toward H2 (112).
Photoionization studies of ConNan (112), NbnAlm (116), ConVm (114), and
ConMnm (115) failed to reveal any correlation of their IPs with reactivity toward
hydrogen. It appears that for these systems, the observed changes in reactivity
on metal atom addition/substitution were not due to global changes in electronic

Electronic Shell Effects
Although clusters of open d-shell transition metals possess physical and chemical
properties that vary in a seemingly unpredictable way from one size to the next,
coinage metal clusters, Cun, Agn, and Aun, exhibit many properties having an un-
derlying periodicity. In particular, studies of physical properties such as ionization
potentials and electron afﬁnities and their relative stabilities toward unimolecular
dissociation have shown that certain clusters, namely those that have 8, 18, 20,
34, 40 . . . valence electrons, are “special” and stand out from the others (117–
130). It is now well established that this periodicity reﬂects the organization of
the delocalized valence electrons of the clusters into degenerate levels, forming
shells akin to those displayed by atoms. Those clusters possessing ﬁlled electron
shells are predicted to be spherical in shape, and it is these closed-shell clusters
that typically stand out as being special (131–134). An odd-even alternation effect
in cluster properties is often observed to be superimposed on the major spherical
shell-ﬁlling structure and is due to the ﬁlling of electron levels in ellipsoidal (rather
than strictly spherical) particles (131, 135, 136).
Much less is known about the chemical properties of coinage metal clusters,
in particular whether this electronic shell-ﬁlling phenomenon, which dramatically
inﬂuences their physical properties, affects their chemical behavior as well. Gen-
erally, reactivity surveys have revealed many similarities of the reaction channels
displayed by Cun, Agn, and Aun to those of the corresponding macroscopic sur-
faces (5, 71, 77, 82, 137–142). Copper clusters, for example, are reactive toward
carbon monoxide (137, 139) and oxygen (71, 143), but they are essentially inert
toward molecular hydrogen adsorption (5, 71), behavior that parallels that ob-
served on bulk copper surfaces. However, underlying the overall similarities in
their behavior, a size-dependent ﬁne structure with its origin in the periodic ﬁlling
of electron shells can sometimes be observed. For example, studies of CunCO+
complexes found that those species possessing a closed electronic shell, namely
Cu7CO+ and Cu17CO+, were more stable toward collision-induced dissociation
than were their open shell neighbors (139). As illustrated in Figure 9, ﬂow-tube
kinetics studies of copper clusters by Winter et al (143) revealed that Cu20, Cu40,
and Cu92, clusters possessing closed electronic subshells, are less reactive toward
molecular oxygen than are their open subshell neighbors. This inertness of closed
shell copper clusters toward oxygen chemisorption is also reﬂected in the single
collision sticking probabilities measured by Andersson et al (71) (Figure 9). In this
system, the lower reactivities of the high-IP, closed shell copper clusters are readily
understood in terms of an activation barrier involving formation of a Cu+
n −O−
2
complex. Interesting electronic effects have also been observed in the photodis-
sociation studies of AgnOCS complexes (144), in which low-IP, odd-n com-
plexes follow the AgnS + CO dissociation pathway, whereas the high-IP, even-n
complexes exhibit simple Agn + OCS desorption. These results are consistent
with the involvement of a dissociative Ag+
n −OCS−charge transfer complex that,
at λ = 308 nm, is energetically accessible only in the odd-n complexes.

Not all reactions of coinage metal clusters are sensitive to electronic shell
structure. For example, the binding energy of water molecules to copper clusters
follows a pattern of geometric (icosahedral) shell and subshell closings character-
izing the underlying clusters, a local—rather than global—electronic effect (143)
(Figure 9). Generally, it appears that association reactions involving electron pair–
donating molecules that form coordination-like bonds are facile, such that neither
their reactive pathways nor their rates depend on the global electronic structure of
the underlying clusters.
Reactions at Equilibrium
Many cluster-molecule reactions proceed irreversibly on the timescale of the ex-
periment, as a consequence of the relative high binding energy for transition metals
with commonly investigated molecular reactants such as hydrogen, oxygen, and
carbon monoxide. It is this assumption of irreversibility that underpins the de-
termination of rate coefﬁcients for association reactions using the methods of
pseudo–ﬁrst order kinetics in ﬂow-tube experiments (vide supra). However, for
molecules that bind more weakly, equilibrium can be achieved, even within the
short contact times of ﬂow-tube chemistry experiments:

of adsorption, via van’t Hoff plots. This approach has been used to measure the
adsorption enthalpies of NH3 onto Con and Nin (145), NH3 on Agn (81, 138), and
N2 on Nin (87). The values of 1H0
ads obtained in each of these studies, although
similar in magnitude to those found on the corresponding extended metal surfaces,
vary somewhat with cluster size. For NH3 on Agn, the size variation in 1H0
ads was
found (81) to be particularly large, varying from about 7 kcal mol−1 for Ag7 to
approximately 17 kcal mol−1 for Ag2, Ag16, and Ag17, thus bracketing the 1H0

value of 11 kcal mol−1 calculated for NH3 adsorption on bulk silver.
MOLECULAR VERSUS DISSOCIATIVE CHEMISORPTION:

Although techniques for the measurement of the rate coefﬁcients (or sticking prob-
abilities) of Mn + A reactions are now well established, methods for determining
the state of the adsorbate species within the Mn A complex (i.e. whether molecu-
larly chemisorbed, dissociatively chemisorbed, or physisorbed) are still at a more

primitive stage of development. Lacking other information, the chemisorbed state
of the reactant molecule A within the Mn Am complexes is often assumed to be that
observed on the corresponding macroscopic transition metal surface. The sparsity
andtransientnatureofthesamplescombinedwiththeenormousdensityofvibronic
states of these large molecules generally preclude the application of traditional
spectroscopic techniques of structure elucidation. The presence of multiple iso-
mers only compounds the problem. Fortunately, photoionization spectroscopy and
IR spectroscopy are two generally applicable techniques that, in combination, can
tell us much of what we wish to know about the nature of cluster-adsorbate binding.
PhotoionizationThresholdShifts: SimpleElectrostaticModels
Even without a detailed knowledge of cluster structure, it is possible to glean im-
portant information on the nature of the cluster-adsorbate complex by comparing
the observed variation of cluster IP with adsorbate coverage with the predictions of
simple electrostatic models. A number of studies have demonstrated that adsorbate
addition can have a signiﬁcant effect on cluster IP, analogous to the work function
changes, 1φ, accompanying chemisorption and physisorption of atoms and small
molecules on macroscopic metal surfaces (146–156). The basic premise underly-
ing the application of classical electrostatic models to cluster-adsorbate systems is
that to ﬁrst order, the underlying metal cluster can be treated as a conducting sphere,
in the same way that metal surfaces are treated as perfectly smooth, conducting
planes. Fortunately, the available evidence suggests that transition metal clusters
containing more than ﬁve or six atoms tend to adopt compact, spheroidal shapes in
order to maximize the bonding interaction among atoms, thus conforming to the
spherical assumption of the model to ﬁrst order. Of course, such simple models
can be expected to break down for very small clusters in which deviations from
sphericity are large, or when the cluster-molecule reaction leads to a complete
structural rearrangement of the metal cluster, for example in reactions leading to
ionic oxide or halide lattice clusters.
For adsorbates possessing a permanent dipole moment, 1IP can amount to sev-
eral tenths of an electron volt per adsorbed atom or molecule for clusters containing
up to a few tens of metal atoms. It is generally observed that electron donating
species (e.g. NH3) with dipole moments oriented toward the metal cluster sur-
face induce an IP decrease (146, 148), whereas electron withdrawing species (e.g.
atomic hydrogen) lead to an IP increase (147, 151), analogous to the 1φ effects
observed on bulk metal surfaces. For a spherical cluster of radius R containing m
identical adsorbate molecules with dipole moment µ, a simple Born-Haber cycle
equates adsorbate-induced IP changes to the changes in adsorbate binding energy
resulting from ionization of the cluster:
1IP =
emµ
(R + δ)2 ,
9.
where e is the elementary charge, and δ is the effective distance of the (point)
dipole from the cluster surface (146, 148). In this case, 1IP is determined by

the additional energy of the charge-permanent dipole pair(s) in the photoion and
is predicted to be positive if the dipole is oriented away from the cluster and
negative if oriented toward the cluster. An example of the latter case is illustrated
in Figure 10 for ammonia on nickel clusters, in which signiﬁcant IP lowering is
observed (148).
The adsorbate molecule (or atom) need not possess a permanent dipole moment
as a free entity in order to induce an IP change when adsorbed. For example,
in reactions of hydrogen with Vn, Nbn, Fen, and Nin, it has been observed that
the IPs of the resulting cluster-hydrogen complexes are higher than those of the
corresponding bare clusters, indicating that the hydrogen atom forms a bond having
a net dipole pointing away from the cluster (151, 156, 157). This observation is
consistent with hydride formation, conﬁrming that chemisorption is dissociative
rather than molecular.
A similar electrostatic model (149, 150) predicts that adsorption of nonpolar
species onto metal clusters will lead to a change in IP that is somewhat smaller in
magnitude than those due to the presence of typical dipolar adsorbates. In this case,
the sign of 1IP is predicted to be always negative and is due to the stabilizing effect
of the charge-induced dipole interaction in the nascent photoion (149, 150). This
IP-lowering effect has been demonstrated in photoionization studies of NbnArm
(149, 150), AunXem (153), NinHm(H2)p (156), and FenHm(H2)p complexes (157).
The magnitude of 1IP is predicted (149, 150) to be proportional to the static
polarizability α of the adsorbate:
1IP =
αe2m
2(R + δ)4 .

Figure 11
The two lowest-lying isomers of Ag3C2H4 calculated from density func-
tional theory (158).
Photoionizationstudiesofethyleneadsorptionontosilverclustershavealsodemon-
strated such IP-lowering behavior (78). Quantitatively, Equation 10 predicts 1IP
per adsorbed ethylene molecule of −0.16 eV and −0.05 eV for Ag5 and Ag15,
respectively, values that are considerably smaller than the experimentally ob-
served 1IP values of approximately −0.3 eV and −0.1 eV per ethylene molecule
for Ag5(C2H4)m and Ag15(C2H4)m. This suggests that ethylene does not behave
merely as a polarizable point body on the surface of silver clusters (i.e. bound
simply by van der Waals forces), but rather that it binds with a net ethylene →
cluster charge donation, thus forming a polar π-bonded complex having a net
dipole moment pointing toward the cluster. This conjecture has been put on a
ﬁrmer theoretical footing via gradient-corrected density-functional theory calcu-
lations of Ag3(C2H4) performed by Salian et al (158). These calculations revealed
two low-lying minima, the structures of which are shown in Figure 11. The IP of
the lowest-energy isomer (Figure 11a) is predicted to lie 0.37 eV lower than that
calculated for bare Ag3, in quantative agreement with the experimentally deter-
mined range for 1IP (78), whereas the IP of the higher-energy isomer (Figure 11b)
is predicted to be 0.16 eV above that of the bare trimer.
Infrared Spectroscopy
Complementary information regarding the nature of cluster-adsorbate bonding can
be obtained by probing the adsorbed species itself using IR photodissociation spec-
troscopy. The IR photodissociation spectra obtained by Koretsky & Knickelbein
(78) for small silver cluster–ethylene complexes, Agn(C2H4)m and Agn(C2D4)m,
are shown in Figure 12. The molecular nature of the chemisorption in Agn(C2H4)m
is immediately conﬁrmed by the prominent depletion bands in the 935–960 cm−1
range, assignable to the IR-active ν7 (b1u) mode and/or to the IR-inactive ν8 (b2g)
mode of C2H4, which in the gas-phase occur at 949 cm−1 and 943 cm−1, respec-
tively. As shown in Figure 12, many of the depletion features displayed by the
Agn(C2H4)m species appear to be composed of several partially resolved bands.

This complexity may be due to presence of both ν7 and ν8 bands. Although the
ν8 mode is not IR active for gas-phase (D2h) ethylene, adsorption onto the surface
of the silver clusters could induce this fundamental to become IR-allowed via
symmetry breaking. For reduction of D2h to C2h, C2v, and Cs point groups, the
b2g irreducible representation resolves to bg, b1, and a′′ species, respectively. Of
these, the latter two are IR active. Alternatively, it is possible that all the observed
bands are assignable solely to the IR-allowed ν7 mode of ethylene, but arise from
different Agn isomers than those that produce the 940 cm−1 band, or to the coex-
istence of complexes in which ethylene molecules occupy topologically different
sites on the surface of the clusters.
As shown in Figure 12, the photodissociation spectra of Agn(C2D4)m com-
plexes each display two depletion features. The bands around 1070–1080 cm−1
are readily assigned to the IR-active ν12 (b3u) mode of ethylene-d4, which lies at
1078 cm−1 in the gas phase. The second feature near 980 cm−1 is due to the ν3 (ag)
fundamental that, although IR-inactive for gas-phase ethylene, becomes dipole
allowed for adsorbed ethylene adopting effective C2v or Cs symmetries within
the complex. The observation of the ν3 band, combined with the absence of the
ν6 (b1g) fundamental, which lies at 1006 cm−1 in the gas phase and is IR-active
under Cs (but not C2v) symmetry, conﬁrms that ethylene effectively adopts a C2v
local symmetry within the complexes, as found explicitly by density-functional
theory calculations of Ag3C2H4 (Figure 11). It is notable that the intensity of the
nominally forbidden ag band is equal to or greater than that of the allowed b3u
feature. The multiplicity of the ag features in the Agn(C2D4)m complexes may,
as discussed above for Agn(C2H4)m, reﬂect the presence of multiple Agn iso-
mers, or of different bonding arrangements of C2D4, within a given complex. The
small magnitude of the shifts in the depletion band frequencies in Agn(C2H4)m
and Agn(C2D4)m compared with the fundamentals of free ethylene conﬁrms a
relatively weak cluster-ethylene interaction.
IR photodissociation spectroscopy has also been used to obtain adsorbate vi-
brational spectra for complexes of ammonia with Agn (80, 81, 159) and Fen (160);
methanol with Fen (73–76), Cun/Agn/Aun (79) and Au+
n (82, 83); benzene with
Agn (77); and ethylene oxide with Agn (78).
In all cases, simple molecular
adsorption was conﬁrmed, with the band positions of the adsorbed molecule
shifted tens of wavenumbers from those of the gas-phase values as is typically ob-
served on macroscopic surfaces (161, 162). Except for Agn(ammonia)m (80, 81)
and Aun(methanol)+
m (83), little variation of band position with the size of the
underlying cluster (n) was observed.
The ability of IR photodissociation spectroscopy to distinguish between molec-
ular and dissociative chemisorption unambiguously was recently demonstrated
in a study of hydrogenated and deuterated iron clusters, FenHm and FenDm, for
n = 9–20 (157). Selected spectra for this system are shown in Figure 13. Although

the spectra for other FenHm and FenDm complexes in then = 9–20 are qualitatively
similar, consisting of many overlapping bands of ∼20 cm−1 width, no two spectra
are exactly alike. The dissimilarity of the FenHm and the corresponding FenDm
species conﬁrms that the depletion features are due to absorption by hydrogen-
and deuterium-containing chromophores. The observed bands lie in the region
of the spectrum where the stretching fundamentals of H on Fe (110) have been
observed (163); however, the surface spectrum is simple by comparison, consisting
of only two bands: the stretching mode at 1060 cm−1 and the bend at 880 cm−1 (no
vibrational spectra of deuterium atoms adsorbed on iron surfaces have yet been
measured). Complexes in which hydrogen was molecularly adsorbed would be
expected to display bands not in this region of the spectrum but rather at much
lower frequencies (164). Further evidence that the hydrogen within the FenHm and
FenDm complexes is atomic rather than molecular was provided by photoionization
experiments in which cluster IPs were observed to increase on reaction with H2
(vide supra).
Interpretation of these complicated spectra was aided by density functional cal-
culations, performed for highly symmetric (Th) model complexes, Fe13H14 and
Fe13D14, that were chosen for computational simplicity. For Fe13H14, a number of
vibrational fundamentals involving H stretching and bending motion are predicted
to lie within the 800–1500 cm−1 range, but only those at 850, 1300, and 1460 cm−1
are IR-active and only the high frequency wing of the 850 cm−1 band reaches into
the 880–1090 cm−1 experimentally probed (see Figure 13). For Fe13D14, the cor-
responding IR-active fundamentals are predicted to lie at 606, 925, and 1040 cm−1.
Note that the stoichiometry of the computational model differs from that of the
experimentally observed hydrogen-saturated complex (Fe13H12.) This illustrates
the general observation that the measured FenHm/FenDm saturation stoichiome-
tries for n = 9–20 are difﬁcult if not impossible to rationalize using chemically
intuitive, highly symmetric structural models. The sparsity of the calculated spec-
tra compared with those measured experimentally for Fe13H12 and Fe13D12 (see
Figure 13) is likely a consequence of the high symmetry of the model, whereby the
resulting degeneracies and forbidden transitions reduce the number of predicted IR
bands.
OUTLOOK
Despite the explosion of activity over the past 15 years, the ﬁeld of metal cluster
chemistry remains largely unexplored territory, even at the simplest descriptive
level. And although many metal cluster-molecule systems have yet to be examined
fortheﬁrsttime, eventhemostthoroughlystudiedmetalcluster-moleculereactions
cannot be fully understood without a detailed knowledge of the geometric and
electronic structures of the clusters themselves—still the pieces of the structure-
reactivity puzzle that are most difﬁcult to obtain. There is no single technique that

will tell us all we wish to know about the reaction rates and pathways of transition
metal clusters. Instead, as in traditional surface science, which uses a number of
probes to unravel the details of chemisorption, developing a detailed understanding
of metal cluster reactions will require the application of many complementary
methods, both experimental and theoretical.
