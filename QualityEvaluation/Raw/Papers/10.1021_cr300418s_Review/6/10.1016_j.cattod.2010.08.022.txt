Model silver nanocatalysts between 9 and 23 nm in size were prepared by size-selected cluster deposition
from a free cluster beam on amorphous alumina ﬁlms and their size-dependent catalytic performance
studied in the partial oxidation of propylene under realistic reaction conditions. Smaller clusters pref-
erentially produced acrolein, while the 23 nm particles were considerably more selective towards the
formation of propylene oxide, at reaction rates far exceeding those previously reported for larger silver
particles. The activity of clusters dropped signiﬁcantly with increasing particle size. First-principle calcu-
lations, of the activation energies for oxygen adsorption and its dissociation, at variable surface coverage
yielded surface energies which resulted in particle shapes resembling the experimentally observed shapes
of partially oxidized silver clusters. The calculated activation barriers for propylene oxide and acrolein
formation on various facets and on the edges of the nanoparticles provided detailed information about
the energetics of the competing reaction pathways. The size- and corresponding morphology dependent
theoretical activity and selectivity are in good accord with experimental observations.

1. Introduction
Propylene oxide (PO) and acrolein (Acr) are important pre-
cursors for a variety of commodity chemicals [1]. Traditional
processes to produce propylene oxide are energy-intensive, inef-
ﬁcient and environmentally unfriendly since the processes involve

multiple steps and create large quantities of by-products and
waste. Therefore, the heterogeneously catalyzed direct oxidation
of propylene by molecular oxygen has received increased atten-
tion [1–9]. Silver-based catalysts have been successfully used
in the epoxidation of ethylene on both the laboratory [3] and
industrial scale [10], but no viable catalyst for propylene epox-
idation has been identiﬁed that would use molecular oxygen.
Much of the effort so far has been centered on the nature
of the active oxygen species [11] and size-dependent selectiv-
ity and reactivity [2]. However, the use of silver in propylene
epoxidation has been hampered by either low conversion or
poor selectivity towards propylene oxide. Moreover, to date a
detailed atomic level understanding of this process is still lacking
[2,5,8,9,12].

In the case of heterogeneous catalysts dispersed on supports, it is
a challenging task to elucidate the structure–reactivity relationship
with the traditional catalyst preparation methods which intro-
duce variations in mean particle size and particle size distribution.
Therefore, size-selected cluster deposition methods are well posi-
tioned to contribute to the understanding of the effect of catalyst
particle size on its catalytic reactivity and selectivity by providing
highly uniform supported model catalyst systems for such stud-
ies [13–29]. In general, the activity of the catalytic metals can be
optimized when used in a form of small sub-nanometer clusters
or small nanoparticles [15,19,26,27,30–42]. In the epoxidation of
propylene to propylene oxide on silver and gold nanoparticles these
catalysts exhibit strongly size-dependent catalytic activity and
selectivity [2,7,43,44]. However, none of the nanometer sized cata-
lysts reported to date possess both high conversion and selectivity
towards propylene oxide. For example, Haruta and co-workers dis-
covered a highly selective propylene epoxidation catalyst based
on titania-supported 2–4 nm gold nanoparticles when hydrogen
is co-fed with the oxygen and propylene mixture [7]. However,
the selectivity of these gold nanoparticles is extremely sensitive to
their size and shape, with particles smaller than 1.5–2.0 nm mainly
producing propane and particles larger than 4–5 nm preferentially
catalyzing oxidation of propylene to CO2 and H2O. Size-preselected
sub-nanometer gold clusters stabilized on amorphous alumina
exhibit highly selective catalysis for this reaction [23], while sub-
nanometer Ag clusters and their aggregates possess high activity
[25]. In order to make a correlation between the shape/morphology
of the catalyst and its function, it is necessary to track changes in
nanoparticle shape induced by temperature and exposure to reac-
tive gases in situ, under realistic reaction conditions. In the present
study, grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS)
[22,24,44–46] was used to monitor the change in size and shape
of supported silver nanoparticles, while the catalytic performance
was followed simultaneously by temperature-programmed reac-
tion (TPRx) under atmospheric pressure.
On the theoretical side, modern developments in computational
software and hardware allow one to investigate adsorption mech-
anisms and elementary reaction steps on realistic metal systems,
and studies have been conducted on the oxidation of extended Ag
surfaces and the interaction of alkenes with both bare and oxidized
Ag substrates in previous work [47–56]. For oxygen adsorption on
the (1 0 0) surface, a close competition has been found between
oxygen-induced reconstruction and simple oxygen chemisorption
in hollow sites [47] and it has been shown that at medium/high
oxygen coverage the formation of subsurface oxygen species is
energetically favoured. In contrast, alkenes bind rather weakly on
bare extended silver surfaces, mainly through the interaction of
the  orbitals of the organic species with the d orbitals of the
metal atoms [49], even though the binding energy can increase
in the proximity of extended defects (steps) and adatoms [50,51].
Co-adsorption with oxygen promotes the interaction of alkenes.
Chemisorbed oxygen adatoms interact with oleﬁnic molecules
giving rise to oxametallacycle intermediates [52] which act as pre-
cursors for the formation of epoxide or aldehyde species, while
surface reconstructions induced by subsurface oxygen atoms pro-
duce an increase of the interaction energy of ethylene molecules
with the surface due to a push-out effect [48]. The formation of
-bonded oleﬁnic species and oxametallacycle intermediates has
been shown to take place also on the silver (1 1 1) surface [53].
The involved bonding mechanisms are similar to those on the
(1 0 0) surface in the case of mild oxidation with the formation of
chemisorbed species. At high temperature (above 100 ◦C) in an oxy-
gen atmosphere the (1 1 1) surface reconstructs with the formation
of mixed silver–oxygen phases [54–56], and the formation of oxam-
etallacycle intermediates can occur as well due to the presence of
surface oxygen atoms [54].

In the present joint experimental and theoretical work, a
study of the catalytic activity and selectivity of size-selected sil-
ver clusters of 9–23 nm size in the direct partial oxidation of
propylene using molecular oxygen to preferentially produce propy-
lene oxide and acrolein was undertaken. The very strong effect of
size on catalyst performance is presented, along with the evolu-
tion of the morphology of the catalyst under reaction conditions.
Accompanying ﬁrst-principle simulations are then used to clar-
ify the adsorption and reaction mechanisms of oxygen and alkene
species on extended silver surfaces and ﬁnite-size models. Theo-
retical studies, here supplement prior results and explore cluster
reshaping under realistic conditions. The cooperative effects in
surface/oxygen/alkene interaction are investigated and compared
with experimental results on nanometer clusters. Differences in the
structural features of the nanometer sized silver clusters between
room temperature and 200 ◦C are highlighted, focusing in partic-
ular on the presence and availability of reactive oxygen species,
and are used to set up models providing a coherent mechanistic
framework for the restructuring of clusters and its inﬂuence on
selectivity, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental
catalytic data.
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Support preparation: atomic layer deposition of thin
amorphous alumina ﬁlms
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to deposit the alumina
support layer on top of a naturally oxidized silicon wafer. ALD is a
thin ﬁlm growth technique that uses alternating cycles of saturating
reactions between gaseous precursor molecules and the surface of
the substrate to deposit ﬁlms. In the case of Al2O3 it uses alternating
exposures to trimethyl aluminum (TMA) and water [57]:
Al–OH ∗+ Al(CH3)3 →Al–O–Al(CH3)2∗+ CH4
(1)
Al–CH3∗+ H2O →Al–OH ∗+ CH4
(2)
The asterisks represent surface species, and the reactions have
been simpliﬁed to show only a single functional group. In Eq.
(1), the surface hydroxyl species OH* reacts with TMA to attach
methyl-terminated Al atoms and liberate methane gas. In Eq. (2),
the resulting –CH3* surface groups react with water to restore the
hydroxyl-termination and again liberate methane. In an iterative
fashion, ﬁlms of well-controlled thickness can be grown. In this
study, six ALD cycles were used to coat the silicon. The thickness of
the ALD Al2O3 layer was 7.2 ˚
A based on a growth rate of 1.2 ˚
A per
cycle determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry. From the known
density of ALD Al2O3 of 3.0 g/cm3, we estimate a monolayer thick-
ness of 3.0 ˚
A so that the Al2O3 used in this study had a thickness
of 2–3 monolayers. With a scanning tunneling microscope (Omi-
cron LT-STM) the rough and amorphous surface of the created
support layer was revealed (Fig. 1). The surface roughness of about

0.69 nm (RMS) is to be viewed as a lower limit due to convolution
effects with the tip geometry. Uniform appearance and absence of
large protrusions are characteristics of the substrates. Much of the
roughness arises from the incomplete second monolayer. Support-
ing low energy electron diffraction (LEED) investigations showed
no evidence of a periodic crystal structure at the sample surface.
2.2. Size-selected cluster deposition
Deposition of Ag clusters was performed in Rostock using an arc
cluster ion source (ACIS) that is connected to a ultrahigh vacuum
(UHV) preparation chamber [18]. The clusters are deposited from
the free beam onto a ﬂat 10 mm × 10 mm substrate produced by
ALD as described above.
The wafers are transferred into the UHV chamber with a load-
lock system and positioned in front of the ACIS. The schematic set-
up of the deposition process is shown in Fig. 2.
In a cylindrical Ag cathode an arc is ignited between the water-
cooled anode and the target-material. As a result, metal-vapor
plasma is formed in the high temperature area. The cluster aggrega-
tion takes place in an inert gas atmosphere of about 80% He and 20%
Ar with a total pressure of about 3 kPa within the cathode. Around
the cathode a solenoid is mounted to ensure a rotation of the arc
so that the cathode is eroded uniformly in all radial directions. The
cluster beam passes an expansion channel, a system of aerodynam-
ical lenses [58] and two skimmers where it is separated from the
large part of the rare gas. An electrostatic quadrupole is used to
deﬂect the charged clusters by 90◦and to select the particle size.
The latter is adjusted by the voltage applied to the four quadrupole
plates. For this work voltages between 100 and 2000 V are used
for sizes between 9 and 23 nm. The cluster current measured at a
highly transparent metal grid is proportional to the cluster ﬂux at
the location of the sample. It has been calibrated for various cluster
sizes by determining the cluster density utilizing TEM. One main
challenge during deposition is to reduce the gas pressure from
2.96 × 10−2 atm in the cathode to UHV conditions at the support
to obtain pure and well-deﬁned particle deposits [58,59]. Several
differential pumping stages are used for this purpose as shown in
Fig. 2. For cluster sizes used in this work the kinetic energy per
atom is less than 20 meV which is estimated based on a spherical
cluster shape with measured cluster diameters. These energies are
well within the regime of soft-landing conditions observed exper-
imentally [60,61] and obtained from simulations [62,63]. Since no
fragmentation or implantation takes place under such conditions,
the number of atoms is not expected to change upon deposition.
The absence of fragments was conﬁrmed by scanning electron
microscopy. The particles therefore maintain their gas-phase size
and shape, but may experience a ﬂattening upon impact and with
interaction with the substrate [64]. The deposition process further
leads to a random orientation of particles in the present size range
[65]. For the sample coverage a cluster density of about 108 clusters
per cm2 was applied to avoid particle aggregation upon landing. As
determined by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray scattering
(see below for details), the lateral diameter of the supported size-
selected clusters was around 9, 12 and 23 nm on the three samples,
respectively.
2.3. Scanning electron microscopy
After the deposition process the samples were transferred to
air and transported to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at the
Paul Scherrer Institut to determine the lateral diameter and number
of clusters on the support before they continued to the Advanced
Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory for X-ray scatter-
ing and reactivity studies. After the reactivity studies, the samples
were sent back to the Paul Scherrer Institut for SEM in order to
verify particle size after the reactivity studies. The high resolution
SEM measurements were performed on a Zeiss FE-SEM Supra VP55
apparatus.
2.4. In situ high-resolution environmental transmission electron
microscopy
For the in situ observation in a high-resolution environmental
transmission electron microscopy (HRETEM) at CINaM Marseille,
the silver clusters were directly deposited on special copper discs
covered with a transparent 6–8 nm thick carbon ﬁlm. The copper
discs had a diameter of 3 mm and were pierced at the center by
7 adjacent holes of 0.15 mm in diameter in a hexagonal arrange-
ment. With a continuous carbon ﬁlm covering the pierced area,
the discs are gas proof and were tested up to a pressure differ-
ence of 3.95 × 10−1 atm on each side before use. The samples were
mounted in a closed environmental TEM sample holder from JEOL,
described in details in previous work [66,67]. This sample holder
can be used with a standard microscope (JEOL 3010) equipped
with a large gap pole piece (Cs = 1.4 mm). Under these conditions,
the point resolution is 0.21 nm. A similar copper disc with a clean
carbon ﬁlm was used to close the sample holder. The clusters
were sandwiched between the two carbon ﬁlms; the gas was cir-
culated between the carbon ﬁlms at the level of the sample. In
this simple closed environmental cell, the gas pressure must be
lower than 2.96 × 10−2 atm at room temperature. In this work, sil-

ver clusters were imaged at room temperature and a gas pressure of
3.95 × 10−3 atm in pure H2 and pure O2. The images were recorded
with a fast CCD camera to minimize exposure times. In order to
reduce undesired effects caused by the electron beam, which after
long exposures can cause a degradation of the sample, the adjust-
ments of the electron beam optics were done on different areas
than the working area of interest.
2.5. Grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering
Grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) has
been proved to be very powerful to study particles at surfaces and
their transformations under vacuum conditions and low-pressure
reactive gas environments at the nanometer [24,25,44,45,68–71]
and sub-nanometer scale [22,23,25,41,72]. In addition to the deter-
mination of the size and shape of clusters, GISAXS can also provide
information about faceting of nanoparticles [44,71] and structure
of fractals [73,74]. The GISAXS experiments were performed at the
12-ID-C beamline of the Advanced Photon Source using X-rays of
12.0 keV energy in a reaction cell of our own design. The internal
volume of the cell is approximately 25 ml, with the sample mounted
on a ceramic heater in the center of the cell. The cell was sealed with
mica windows and mounted on a computer controlled goniometer
and equipped with gas feedthroughs mounted in the side walls
of the cell. The reactant gas mixture was premixed in a remotely
controlled gas-mixing unit with calibrated mass ﬂow controllers
(Brooks model SLA5850). The reaction temperature was controlled
using a ceramic heater, and the sample temperature measured with
a K-type thermocouple attached to the edge of the heater surface.
As shown in Fig. 3, the X-ray beam was scattered off the surface of
the sample at near the critical angle (˛c = 0.18◦) of the substrate.
A 1024 × 1024 pixel two-dimensional MarCCD detector was used
for recording the GISAXS images from the sample. GISAXS data
were collected as a function of reaction temperature and time. The
two-dimensional X-ray images were analyzed by taking cuts in
the qy direction for horizontal information and in the qz direction
for vertical information. Scattering vectors q are calculated from
(4/) sin f where f is the scattering half angle and  is the wave-
length of the X-rays. The data were analyzed by Guinier analysis
[75], providing the horizontal and vertical particle radii of gyration
RgH and RgV, respectively. The diameter and height of the nanopar-
ticles can be calculated from the radii of gyration as 2.58 × RgH and
RgV, respectively. The uncertainty in the particle size was estimated
to be ±0.2 nm or better, which is 2% of the particle size or less. In this

tered beam angle ˛f.
study, GISAXS was used to determine the diameter of clusters size
under vacuum conditions before and after the reaction as well as to
monitor changes in particle morphology under reaction conditions.
2.6. Temperature-programmed reaction
The catalytic tests were performed in the reaction cell designed
for the GISAXS experiments (see above) using temperature-
programmed reaction (TPRx) at 1.3 atm pressure and total gas ﬂow
of 30 sccm. To achieve thermal equilibrium between the heater and
sample during the application of a temperature ramp, a low heat-
ing rate (<1.5 ◦C/min.) was used. The gas mixture used consisted
of 0.67% C3H6 and 0.33% O2 in helium. The reaction products were
analyzed on a differentially pumped quadrupole mass spectrome-
ter (Pfeiffer Prisma). m/z = 58 was chosen to monitor the propylene
oxide, as has been used by several other groups [76–79]. Theoret-
ical and experimental work has shown that during the oxidation
of propylene a variety of partial oxidation products can in princi-
ple form, some of which having the same molecular formula and
mass as propylene oxide (the parent ions of acetone and propenol
also have m/z = 58), a careful analysis of the mass spectra of the
gas mixture exiting from the reaction cell was performed. Based
on fragment patterns of the NIST mass spectra of these species the
formation of acetone and propenol could be excluded based on the
following. For the on-line analysis of the gas mixture exiting from
the reaction cell during the course of the reaction, the mass spec-
trometer was operated in multi-ion-detection mode (MID). This
operation mode allows for a simultaneous monitoring of the ion
current corresponding to up to 24 m/z values. In our experiments a

are background-corrected ones, using a support of the same size and composition without catalytic particles, and tested under identical conditions as the catalyst-containing
sample. The background ion signal intensity for propylene oxide measured on a blank alumina support were below 4% of the signal intensity measured in the presence of
silver nanoclusters, respectively. The mass spectrometer was calibrated using certiﬁed gas mixtures of the reactants and products in balance helium gas under identical ﬂow
conditions as in the TPRx experiments.
total of 20 m/z values were monitored, including the m/z values cor-
responding to the mass peaks of acetone and propenol, leading to
the following conclusions: (1) propenol could be excluded because
the mass spectrometer’s MID signal corresponding to m/z = 57, the
major peak of propenol, was below the detection limit during the
entire temperature-programmed reaction cycle. Acetone could be
excluded because there was no change in the mass spectrometer
signal (MID) corresponding to m/z = 43, the major peak of ace-
tone [80]. The uncertainty in the mass spectrometer signal has
been estimated from standard deviation of 11–23 readout points
which includes points both below and above the plotted reaction
temperature. The uncertainty is estimated to be ∼2% of the ion cur-
rent. Taking into consideration an estimated 10% uncertainty in the
determination of the number of deposited atoms, the uncertainty
in determination of the turn-over rates is estimated to be about
10% of the reported values. This approach is analogous to the one
reported by the Anderson group [81].
An estimate of the number of accessible surface silver atoms to
the reactants was done by assuming hemispherical particle shape
for the supported particles, with the lateral diameter and aspect
ratio determined by SEM and GISAXS. The exposed surface area of
the particles was calculated from the average height and diame-
ter of particles. (This excluded the Ag atoms sitting on the alumina
support which were inaccessible to the reactant molecules.) The
number of accessible atoms of the hemisphere was calculated by
taking into consideration the 2.88 ˚
A Ag–Ag distance in Ag(1 1 1)
with a fcc structure [82].
3. Computational methods
Density-functional (DF) calculations on the oxidation of Ag
surfaces were performed using the QuantumEspresso computa-
tional code [83], employing ultrasoft pseudopotentials [84] and
the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) [85] exchange-correlation
functional. Values of 40 and 240 Ryd were employed as the energy
cut-offs for the selection of the plane wave basis set for the
description of the wave-function and the electronic density, respec-
tively. DF calculations were performed spin-polarized by applying
a Gaussian smearing technique with a broadening of the one-
particle levels of 0.03 eV. To describe the silver surfaces, a supercell
approach with a 7-layer metal slab was employed. To describe oxy-
gen adsorption at increasing coverage, (3 × 3) and (2 × 2) cells were
used; namely the (3 × 3) cell has been used in the case of 1/9 cov-
erage, whereas the (2 × 2) cell for 1/4 and 1/2 coverages. A (4 4 1)
k-grid was used to sample both the (2 × 2) and the (3 × 3) cells. In
the case of the (1 1 0) surface, where the two in-plane lattice vec-
tors of the unit cell do not have the same length, we have adopted a
(4 3 1) k-grid. The silver atoms were positioned at the crystal sites
of the fcc structure at a ﬁrst-neighbour distance of 2.947 ˚
A, corre-
sponding to the equilibrium value predicted for fcc silver by our
DF/PBE approach. The inner three layers were kept ﬁxed in the
crystal positions, whereas the outer two were allowed to relax. A
symmetric adsorption on both sides of the metal slab was adopted
to cancel the dipole moment developed by the adsorption process.
Empty space between replicated cell was chosen between 10 and
15 ˚
A.
The DF calculations for the partial oxidation of propylene were
carried out using the DACAPO code [86], which also employs ultra-
soft pseudopotentials. The set-up is slightly different: the PW91
functional [87] was used for exchange-correlation, and in order to
keep the computational cost low (due to the large number of simu-
lations which these type of studies of reaction pathways requires)
the energy cut-off for the plane wave basis was slightly lower
(25 Ryd). For the same reason, the Ag(1 1 1) surface was modeled
using a 3-layer metal slab (relaxing only the ﬁrst layer). Energy
barriers were calculated by a constrained minimization method,
involving several simulations where the reaction coordinate (C–O
or C–H bond distance) was restricted at increasingly smaller values,
while allowing the rest of the system to freely relax [88].
4. Experimental results and discussion
4.1. Characterization of the size of the supported clusters by SEM
and GISAXS
Representative SEM images obtained on a silver sample before
and after reaction are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The
average lateral diameter of the clusters is determined by using the
Scion Image software. The error bar is the standard deviation of the
corresponding particle size counted from several SEM images on
different areas of the given sample. The samples #1, #2 and #3
consisted of discrete silver clusters with an average size of 23.3, 12
and 8.7 nm, respectively, with a very narrow size distribution (<5%)
as shown with bars in Fig. 4c. No noticeable change is observed
in the mean cluster size and its distribution before and after the
reaction. Cluster lateral diameters determined by GISAXS for sam-
ples #1 and #2 are also very well matched with SEM results. The
density of the silver particles on sample #3 is too low for accu-

rate GISAXS measurements. Cluster lateral diameters and heights
are determined from the Guinier analysis of the GISAXS images col-
lected at room temperature under pure helium. The results show an
average aspect ratio of about 1.6. The uncertainty of the dimensions
obtained by the analysis of the GISAXS data (∼0.2 nm) is calculated
based on the counting statistics, which provides errors of data ﬁt-
ting (linear regression in this case). As discussed in detail in Ref.
[24], the aspect ratio of the silver nanoclusters undergoes dramatic
changes after the exposure of the particles to the reactant gas mix-
ture and further evolves with temperature. Similar changes were
observed for the smaller cluster sizes reported here.
The alumina-supported silver nanoclusters are very stable
catalysts—they retain their size over the course of 4–6 reaction
hours, as determined by GISAXS and by the analysis of SEM images
collected before and after the reaction cycles (see Fig. 4a and b).
Thus we could exclude both aggregation and Ostwald ripening
[89] under our reaction conditions for all three particle sizes—an
important aspect in the light of potential future applications.

smaller size silver clusters #2 and #3 (12 and 8.7 nm lateral diam-
eter, respectively) start to react at much lower temperature than
the largest particles #1 (23.3 nm); the latter start to show catalytic
activity at ∼80 ◦C and reaching maximum activity at ∼150 ◦C [24].
At temperatures above 100 ◦C, the smaller silver clusters #2 and
#3 exhibit about an order of magnitude higher reactivity than the
largest size clusters #1. These results, along with the comparison of
the trends exhibited by the normalized TORs (Fig. 5b) indicate that
the reaction mechanism may change when crossing the ∼20 nm
size range.
Fig. 7. Selectivity of silver catalyst (ratio propylene oxide/acrolein) at 200 ◦C as the
function of particle size.
It should be noted that 100 ◦C is reported to be the required
temperature to form subsurface oxygen in silver via dissociation of
molecular oxygen, which plays important role on extended silver
surfaces [90–92], and Lu et al. identiﬁed an increased Ag2O phase
with decreasing particle size during the epoxidation of ethylene [5].
As reported by Savio et al. [93] in their study of O2 adsorption at
stepped surfaces, open steps favour the dissociation of oxygen and
provide a gateway through which subsurface sites can be accessed.
Fig. 6 shows the turn-over rate of the acrolein, the main co-
product identiﬁed, as a function of reaction temperature. High
reactivity towards acrolein formation, about 4 times of propylene
oxide production, is observed on smallest size clusters #3 (8.7 nm).
The rate of acrolein production sharply decreases with increasing
cluster size, dropping to about 1/3 of the TOR of propylene oxide
on the largest particles (23.3 nm) at 200 ◦C.
The surface-atom based TORs show an interesting, non-linear
decrease of activity with increasing size and corresponding surface
area and volume. Considering the two smallest Ag clusters (aver-
age lateral diameters #3 = 8.7 nm and #2 = 12 nm), the surface-atom
based TOR for PO decreases by about only 10% while acrolein pro-
duction drops by about 90% with the slightly increased cluster size.
For the largest Ag cluster (average lateral diameter #1 = 23.3 nm),
the surface-atom based TORs drop by about a factor of 10 for both
propylene oxide and acrolein. Thus, as we found above for the TOR’s
as a function of temperature, the reaction speciﬁcity also suggests
that the mechanism for the catalytic reaction is signiﬁcantly differ-
ent for the larger clusters. We note that the smaller clusters have a
much higher structural ﬂuxionality, than their larger cousin.
The observed high TOR for propylene oxide formation at 200 ◦C
on the ∼9 nm particles reported here is only about ∼30% lower
than that observed for 2 nm tall and 4 nm in diameter silver par-
ticles made by aggregation of size-selected sub-nanometer silver
trimer clusters [25], thus potentially indicating a new, sub-10 nm
size range for highly active silver-based alkene partial oxida-
tion catalysts. In comparison with reported silver-based propylene

epoxidation catalysts, the TOR for the 9 nm sized clusters per sur-
face atom or per atom is high. For instance, the rate of propylene
oxide molecule formation per surface silver atom is about 1.1 s−1
at 200 ◦C for the 9 nm particles, which is much greater than that
reported for larger silver particles. For example, turn-over rates per
surface atom (≤10−4 per total atom) is reported to be 1 × 10−2 s−1
for 50–660 nm unpromoted silver particles at 220 ◦C [5] and about
5 × 10−3 s−1 for a 3:1 weight ratio Ag/Ni catalyst tested in the
150–300 ◦C temperature range [94]. Thus, the turn-over rates in
this work are more than an order of magnitude higher than the
previously reported data by other groups (for reference data see
Supplemental Online Material of reference [25] for TORs on either
a per surface atom or a per atom basis).
The propylene oxide to acrolein ratio at 200 ◦C is plotted in Fig. 7,
showing a change in selectivity by over an order of magnitude in
the cluster size range ∼9 to ∼23 nm, reinforcing the conclusions
drawn from Table 1. It is noteworthy that acrolein formation occurs
at lower temperature than the temperature for propylene oxide for-
mation, and no onset temperature could be found for this reaction,
indicating that acrolein formation has a very low activation bar-
rier and that surface oxygen may be involved in the production of
acrolein, rather than subsurface oxygen whose formation requires
higher temperatures [1,2,91,95]. Particle size-dependent oxidation
properties have been reported by Bukhtiyarov and Kaichev [91] in
the epoxidation of ethylene. Their results show that concentration
of oxygen in silver catalysts is particle size dependent, and reactive
(subsurface) oxygen appeared for particle sizes greater than 30 nm,
which was associated with the rate of epoxidation of ethylene. Also
it has been reported that adsorbed molecular oxygen is responsi-
ble for the formation of acrolein, whose formation is favoured on
isolated silver sites [1].
As shown in Fig. 7, there is a pronounced effect of particle size
on the selectivity. The smaller size silver clusters may stabilize
adsorbed molecular oxygen more efﬁciently than the bigger clus-
ters, on which O2 dissociatively adsorbs to form subsurface oxygen
preferentially. Surface oxide structure of silver has been in long
debate [54,55,96–99] and high pressure subsurface oxide forma-
tion is not clearly understood [100]. Our results may indicate that,
under given reaction conditions of steady state oxygen concentra-
tion, the silver oxide formation and equilibrium between surface
and subsurface oxygen is particle size dependent, which can rep-
resent a key factor in controlling the selectivity in the oxidation
of propylene. No change in the mass signal corresponding to car-
bon dioxide is observed during the temperature ramp. Presumably,
low oxygen to propylene ratio (1:2) of the reaction gas effectively
suppresses total oxidation.
4.3. In situ GISAXS and HRETEM: change in faceting of the
particles
Fig. 8 shows a sequence of in situ GISAXS images of ∼9 nm
large silver particles recorded during the oxidation of propylene.
Fig. 8a shows the change in scattering pattern at room tempera-
ture caused by the reactants. Few minutes after the inlet of the

reactants a directional scattering emerges (indicated by arrows),
with its angle changing with time. As discussed below, we ascribe
this to the growth of (1 1 1) facets—a reshaping accompanied by
the reorientation of the particles. Fig. 8b shows the further evo-
lution of the scattering pattern with temperature as the reaction
proceeds. The directional scattering vanishes above 75 ◦C and the
symmetrical scattering pattern at 200 ◦C is indicative of the for-
mation of spherical particles at this temperature. Such directional
scattering is observed for example on much larger palladium and
silver nanoparticles [45,72].
In order to unambiguously attribute the observed pattern to
facets, we have imaged silver nanoparticles in environmental HR
TEM (HRETEM) under oxygen and hydrogen. Hydrogen was chosen
instead of propylene to mimic competition for oxygen binding with
propylene on the surface of the particles in order to avoid possible
contamination of the environmental TEM cell.
The results are shown in Fig. 9 and reveal faceted particles. A
reversible change in faceting structure is observed when alternat-
ing between oxygen and hydrogen environment. Fig. 9a shows a
silver cluster under H2 at a pressure of 3.95 × 10−3 atm. According
to the high-resolution images and their calculated Fast Fourier-
Transforms, the cluster is (1 1 0) oriented. In such an orientation,
the lateral faces parallel to the electron beam are (0 0 2) and (1 1 1)
faces.
The shape is limited by extended (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) surfaces, and
by (1 1 0) small surfaces. The Wulff shape ﬁtting to the external
shape is represented in Fig. 9b. The series of Wulff shapes of an
fcc cluster in the same (1 1 0) orientation were simulated for vary-
ing ratios between the surface free energies 111, 001 and 110.
The  values were used with increasing steps of 0.1 J m−2, from 0.9
to 1.3 J m−2 (see for example Ref. [101]). The comparison between
the calculated shapes and experimental ones allows the estima-
tion of the ratios 001/111, and 110/111. According to this shape,
the central distances to the limiting (1 0 0), (1 1 1) and (1 1 0) facets
are evaluated. According to the Wulff theorem, hi/hj = i/j, their
ratio corresponds to the ratio between the surface free energies

100, 111 and 110. The values of the anisotropy ratios are yield
100/111 = 1.00 and 110/111 = 1.11.
Fig. 10a shows the HRETEM image of the same silver cluster
in pure O2 at the same pressure after a few minutes. The cluster
is still (1 1 0) oriented but the shape limited by (1 0 0), (1 1 1) and
(1 1 0) faces is more isotropic. The Wulff shape ﬁtting to the external
shape observed in O2 is represented in Fig. 10b. In this case, the
values of the anisotropy ratios are evaluated to 100/111 = 1.00 and
110/111 = 1.055.
The effect of pure oxygen has previously been observed by the
same technique on Au clusters of the same size, supported on car-
bon [67] or TiO2 [102]. At variance with what was observed for Ag
clusters, the effect of pure O2 on Pt clusters on carbon [103] and Pd
clusters supported on MgO [66], induces an extension of the (0 0 1)
faces at the expense of the (1 1 1) faces. In the case of small Pd and
Au clusters [104], the experimental values from HRETEM observa-
tions in vacuum were also found to have extended the (0 0 1) facets
(100/111 = 1.15). The electron beam effect on the morphology of
the particles has been studied for example in Ref. [105].
In the case of the Ag clusters, the variations of the anisotropy
ratio between the (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) facets in H2 and O2 at a pressure
of 4 × 10−1 kPa, at room temperature were very small. On the oppo-
site side, the more open faces (1 1 0) are extended with O2 exposure.
The HRETEM results provided very important proof about the exis-
tence of facets and their alteration caused by changes in the gas
composition at lower temperatures, as indicated by GISAXS. How-
ever, due to differences between the gas composition and pressure
in the GISAXS and HRETEM experiments, as well as the different
composition of the support used, a direct quantitative comparison
between both experiments would be difﬁcult.
Fig. 11 shows a representative GISAXS image with facet scatter-
ings from ∼9 nm large nanoparticles. The blue solid arrows denote
all possible contributions from (1 1 1) facet scatterings from a single
crystalline nanoparticle oriented in a way that their (2 1 1) plane

tributions from (1 1 0) facet scatterings from the same particles.
The azimuthal angles (the angle between qz and facet scattering) of
(1 1 1) facet scattering are 19.5◦, 61.9◦, and 90◦[106]. Facet scat-
terings in the measured GISAXS images are well matched with
the calculated (1 1 1) facet direction shown by arrows suggesting
that (1 1 1) plane is a dominant facet of Ag nanoparticles under the
mixture of propylene and oxygen. The disappearance of the direc-
tional scattering at higher temperatures (cf. Fig. 8) demonstrates
the loss of (1 1 1) faceting and may be indicative of changes of the
surface energies in the presence of catalytic reactions leading to
more spherical particle shapes and/or the formation of disordered
surface structures.
5. Results of theoretical calculations and discussion
5.1. Oxygen adsorption
The Ag particles as deposited are left in air for several days.
Under these conditions, O2 molecules dissociate over silver sur-
faces, and some degree of surface oxidation can be assumed.
We argue that at room temperature and atmospheric pressure
the exposure of the silver clusters to oxygen produces only
chemisorbed species. Under mild conditions, in fact, the energy
barriers for complex surface reconstructions leading to the forma-
tion of subsurface oxygen species are too high to overcome. This
assumption is supported by experiment, which shows that oxygen-
induced reconstructions of compact surfaces are formed only above
at least 100 ◦C [107] or in the presence of defects [93]. We focus on
the adsorption of oxygen atoms over the most compact metal sur-
faces, namely the (1 1 1), (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) ones (which are those
experimentally observed by HRETEM) and at low coverages (up
to 0.5 ML). At higher coverages, the occupation of subsurface sites
becomes favoured [97,108].
Detailed studies of the oxygen adsorption process on the (1 0 0)
and (1 1 1) surfaces have been already carried out in the literature
[97,108]. Our calculations on these surfaces aim at validating our
approach and for assuring consistency with the calculation per-
formed on the (1 1 0) surface.
We evaluate the adsorption energy (Eads) of an oxygen atom
according to the relation [108]:
Eads = 1
No

Etot −EAg −No
2 EO2

where Etot is the total energy of the composite system, EAg is the
energy of the clean silver surface, EO2 is the energy of an oxygen
molecule and No is the number of oxygen atoms adsorbed on the
surface. Recall that our DF/PBE approach overestimates the bind-
ing energy of the oxygen molecule (6.6 eV against the experimental
value of 5.1 eV), and we expect that the oxygen/silver interaction is
similarly overestimated, as suggested by comparison with experi-
ment on strongly oxidized surfaces [54,55] . To evaluate the Gibbs
free energy corresponding to the adsorption process (Gads), the
O2 molar Gibbs free energy is calculated in the perfect gas approx-
imation, e.g., 0.54 eV at room temperature (298 K) and standard
pressure (1 atm). Both Eads and Gads are reported in Table 2 for
selected cases.
5.1.1. Oxygen adsorption on Ag (1 0 0) surface
In the case of the (1 0 0) surface, the most favourable adsorption
site for oxygen is a four-fold hollow position. In this site, oxy-
gen is surrounded by eight metal atoms (four in-plane and four
below the surface). Looking at the results reported in Table 2, we
can see that the adsorption energy is not appreciably modiﬁed
in passing from 1/9 to 1/4 coverage, but is reduced from 0.70 to
0.57 eV due to the Coulombic repulsion between the negatively
charged adatoms when the concentration is increased to 1/2 (and
the atoms are arranged according to a c(2 × 2) pattern (see Fig. 12a)
At higher coverage, conﬁgurations involving the occupation of sub-
surface sites become energetically favoured with respect to simple
chemisorption. The values of Gads are negative, implying that the
adsorption process occurs spontaneously. From Table 2 a cover-
age of 1/2, characterized by a c(2 × 2) arrangement of the adatoms
(Fig. 12a), results as a good estimate of the real coverage of the
(1 0 0) surface.
5.1.2. Oxygen adsorption on Ag (1 1 1) surface
On the (1 1 1) surface, which has also been the subject of previ-
ous studies (e.g. [97,109]), the most favourable adsorption sites for
oxygen atoms are three-fold hollow sites. In these sites the interac-

tion with the surface is decreased with respect to the (1 0 0) surface,
as metal atoms have higher coordination and the number of Ag–O
bonds is smaller. Looking at the numbers of Table 2, we can see
that at coverage of 1/9 and 1/4 on the (1 1 1) surface the interac-
tion energy is decreased by a factor of 2 with respect to the case of
the (1 0 0) surface (for example, 0.35 eV instead of 0.70 eV at 1/4),
whereas at a coverage of 1/2 the adsorption process results ener-
getically unfavourable. The values of the corresponding Gibbs free
energies are consequently reduced with respect to the (1 0 0) sur-
face, so that adsorption is spontaneous only up to a coverage of
1/4 (this structure is shown in Fig. 12b). This implies also that the
density of oxygen adatoms on the (1 1 1) surface is decreased with
respect the (1 0 0) case.
5.1.3. Oxygen adsorption on Ag (1 1 0) surface
The (1 1 0) surface exhibits an intermediate behavior between
the previous two cases. The most favourable adsorption sites are
the three-fold hollow sites, as in the (1 1 1) surface, but the metal
coordination of the three ﬁrst-neighbour atoms is reduced, so that
the adsorption energy is a bit higher than on the (1 1 1) surface
(0.42 eV instead of 0.35 eV at 1/4, see Table 2) and is only slightly
decreased in passing from 1/9 to 1/4 coverage. In Fig. 12c and d
we show two possibilities of adsorption at coverage of 1/2 among
the several cases investigated. The checkboard pattern (Fig. 12c)
is similar to the c(2 × 2) arrangement of the (1 0 0) surface and
corresponds to a drastic reduction of the adsorption energy with
respect to lower coverage. A better arrangement is realized in the
conﬁguration shown in Fig. 12d, in which the oxygen atoms are
organized in rows running along the [1 1 0] direction. The same row
pattern along the [1 1 1] direction (rows perpendicular to the for-
mer ones) is disfavoured, as the adsorption energy is only 0.08 eV
per adatom. The 1/2 coverage in the [1 1 0]-row arrangement is thus
a reasonable model for the oxygen adsorption on this surface.
5.2. Cluster reshaping
In Table 3, we report the values of surface energy for the (1 1 1),
(1 0 0) and (1 1 0) surfaces when they are clean and in case of
oxygen adsorption at room temperature and p(O2) = 1 atm and
p(O2) = 5 × 10−3 atm, respectively, as evaluated using our DF/PBE
energy values. In the presence of oxygen adsorption, the surface
energies are decreased, due to stabilization via oxidation. This sta-
bilization is strongest in the case of the (1 0 0) surface, characterized
by the largest interaction with the oxygen atoms and by a high
density of adatoms: the surface energy is decreased from 801 to
525 mJ/m2 at p(O2) = 1 atm. On the contrary, the (1 1 1) surface is
the one experiencing the smallest energy gain: its surface energy
changes from 742 to 700 mJ/m2 at p(O2) = 1 atm, due to the weaker
interaction with oxygen atoms and to the lower density of adatoms.
It should be recalled however, as noted above, that our DF/PBE
approach probably overestimates the ratio of Ag–O vs Ag–Ag bind-
ing energies, and correspondingly the stabilization of (1 0 0) vs
(1 1 1) surface.
Such changes in surface energies are reﬂected in a reshaping of
the supported silver clusters in the absence or presence of oxygen.
We apply the Wulff–Kaishev construction to derive the equilibrium
shape of the supported metallic particles. In Fig. 13, we show the
equilibrium shape of representative supported silver particles in
the case of clean surfaces (Fig. 13a) and in the case of oxygen adsorp-
tion at p(O2) = 1 atm (Fig. 13c) and at p(O2) = 5 × 10−3 atm (Fig. 13b).
For simplicity, we take into account only (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) sur-
faces. Furthermore, we assume a (1 1 1) epitaxy with an adhesion
energy equal to 0.20 eV per interacting atom (a reasonable esti-
mate for a simple ionic oxide, see e.g. Ref. [110]. The interaction
with the substrate translates into a further energy gain for the sur-
face in contact with the support, and as a consequence an increase
of the contact area with respect to the opposite face. For clean par-
ticles, the anisotropy ratio between the energy of the (1 0 0) and
(1 1 1) surfaces is 1.08, entailing that the area of the (1 1 1) faces

table, the equilibrium oxygen coverage is also reported, with the corresponding Gibbs free energy per oxygen adatom.

is larger than that of the (1 0 0) faces—see Fig. 13a. In contrast, in
the presence of oxygen adatoms, the ratio is decreased to 0.80 at
p(O2) = 5 × 10−3 atm or to 0.75 at p(O2) = 1 atm, entailing an increase
in the area of the (1 0 0) faces—see Fig. 13b and c. The calculated
aspect ratio of the cluster, i.e., the ratio between the lateral dimen-
sion and the height of the cluster is 1.75 in the absence of oxygen
adsorption, whereas it becomes 1.44 and 1.53 at p(O2) = 1 atm and
p(O2) = 5 × 10−3 atm, respectively.
If we assume that propylene in the absence of oxygen produces
a removal of oxygen atoms from the surface and thus a morphology
change to the gas-phase shape of the particles, our predicted aspect
ratio is 1.75 for the clean particles. The predicted aspect ratio of
1.53 for the oxidized particles at p(O2) = 5 × 10−3 atm is somewhat
smaller than the experimentally determined ∼1.6 aspect ratio of
the oxidized silver particles in the absence of propylene (but see
the warning above). When propylene and oxygen are co-fed in the
reaction mixture, a steady state will be reached, which will depend
on the ﬂux, the propylene/oxygen ratio, etc., and in which the oxi-
dation state of the particles’ surfaces will probably be intermediate
between the two limit conditions (pure propylene and pure oxy-
gen).
The situation is much more complex at T > 100 ◦C. In such con-
ditions, in fact, formation of complex surface reconstructions is
thermodynamically and kinetically favoured, on both the (1 0 0)

adatoms on the Ag(1 1 1) surface.
[111] and the (1 1 1) [55,56,106] surfaces. However the formation
of a thick shell of silver oxide is excluded by HRETEM and GISAXS
data as well as XPS on ∼3.5 nm size silver aggregates [25]. In par-
ticular, XPS data set an upper limit of ∼5% to the oxygen content
of the surface on small nanoparticles [25]. This is compatible with
the formation of oxidized surface layers, but not with a thick AgO
shell. Formation of structurally complex surface reconstructions
in which a mixture of different phase is realized are discussed in
Refs. [55,56,97,107,111] and is also consistent with the experimen-
tal observation at GISAXS that the particles lose faceting at higher
temperatures (c.f. Fig. 8).
5.3. Catalysis
5.3.1. Interaction of propylene or propylene/oxygen mixture with
Ag particle surface
In order to gain a better understanding of the experimental
results under catalytic conditions, the interaction of propylene
with various models of oxygen-covered silver nanoparticles have
been studied, considering cases with both small and large con-
centrations of surface oxygen (in the latter case, leading to the
effective formation of a thin surface oxide). In the ﬁrst place, we
use the Ag(1 1 1) surface as a reasonable approximation of facet
sites on large (∼10 nm) nanoparticles. Two oxygen adatoms are
then placed on the surface, and pathways for either propylene
oxide (C3H6O) or acrolein (C3H4O) formation are evaluated, start-
ing from a propylene oxametallacycle (OMC) intermediate. The

results in Fig. 14 show a relatively high stability (0.7 eV) of the
propylene OMC intermediate; this fact can be understood in terms
of a quite high reactivity of the supported oxygen adatoms. This
value is somewhat larger than the ones found for the analogous
ethene OMC on Ag(1 1 1), which has been extensively studied in the
past [52,107,112–115], being of the order of 0.4 eV. Then, starting
from the OMC intermediate, we have calculated the energy barri-
ers for the competitive steps of either closing the cycle (propylene
oxide formation) or hydrogen transfer from the propylene methyl
group towards a neigbouring oxygen adatom, which represents the
ﬁrst step of acrolein formation. We ﬁnd a sizable barrier of 0.33 eV
for the formation of propylene oxide, much higher than the one
for hydrogen transfer, which is almost a barrierless process (only
0.05 eV barrier). Similar results were found for the (1 0 0) and (1 1 0)
surfaces. We can therefore conclude that, at low oxygen coverage,
facet sites will be more selective towards acrolein production than
towards propylene oxide formation.
5.3.2. Interaction of propylene or propylene/oxygen mixture at Ag
particle edges
In the case of nanoparticle edge sites, the situation is some-
what changed. To obtain a relatively accurate model of this type
of sites, at a reasonable computational cost, we employed a one-
dimensional silver rod, which takes advantage of the periodic
symmetry requirements introduced by our plane-wave-based DF
approach. The insets in Fig. 15 show perspective views of the unit
cell for the relaxed rod structure, 4 Ag atoms long (a size that we
estimate large enough to minimize intercell interaction). Then, dis-
sociation of O2 at the edge leads to a conﬁguration with two oxygen
adatoms placed at both sites of the silver edge (several conforma-
tions of the two oxygen adatoms were tested, in order to ﬁnd the
most stable structure).
The higher reactivity of these sites causes chemisorbed oxygen
atoms to bind more strongly to silver, with a binding energy (with
respect to gas-phase O2) of 0.73 eV (the binding energy at Ag(1 1 1)
is only 0.31 eV). Then, we have again analyzed the propylene inter-
action with the slightly oxidized model catalyst. The results in
Fig. 15 show a weaker propylene OMC–silver interaction (0.30 eV
formation energy); this is due to the stronger binding of oxygen to
silver at these more reactive sites, which causes in turn a weakening
of the C–O bond strengths. Then, starting from the OMC interme-
diate, we have calculated the energy barriers for either propylene
oxide or acrolein formation (again, by hydrogen transfer from the
propylene methyl –CH3 group to the second oxygen adatom). In
both cases, the barriers rise (with respect to the Ag(1 1 1), i.e., facet
sites case), and, although selectivity towards acrolein is larger, the
difference in barrier height is now much reduced.
5.3.3. Interactions of propylene or propylene/oxygen mixture
with Ag particle surface: high oxygen coverage
We now move to the case of high oxygen coverages (which can
induce formation of a thin surface oxide). As a model of the highly
oxidized silver Ag(1 1 1) surface (presumably, with a similar struc-
ture to the one of the facets of relatively large silver nanoparticles),
we take the Ag1.83O/Ag(1 1 1) thin silver oxide found in STM-UHV
experiments by Bocquet et al. [107]. This structure has been also
identiﬁed through DF simulations as particularly stable by Li et al.
[97], being likely to form at temperatures above 100 ◦C. Fig. 16a
shows the side and top view of the p(4 × 4) unit cell; the surface
oxide structure is based on a honeycomb-like lattice of alternat-
ing O–Ag–O bonds, where half of the oxygen atoms are placed on
top of the ﬁrst Ag layer and another half below it. Next, half of the
hexagons are ﬁlled by Ag atoms placed in their centers. In agree-
ment with DF simulations by Bocquet and Loffreda [112], we ﬁnd
a 0.15 eV binding energy of “intact” propylene (i.e., with a dou-
ble C C bond) to the oxide, bonded to a Ag atom. Formation of

and binding energies for the reaction of propylene with the oxidized Ag(1 1 1) sur-
face. The ﬁrst reaction step (C3H6 adsorption) is included. Same atom coloring as
in Fig. 14. We take as energy reference (0.0 eV) the energy of gas-phase propene
plus the energy of the oxidized silver surface. The two insets to the right show
the structures of the Transition States for either acrolein (dashed line) or propy-
lene oxide (full line) formation. The lower inset to the left shows the structure for
propene adsorption, whereas the upper left inset shows the relaxed structure for
the propene oxametallacycle (OMC). Values for energy barriers shown in bold and
between parentheses.
the propylene OMC intermediate is thermoneutral, with a 0.0 eV
binding energy (with respect to gas-phase propylene), which indi-
cates a much less reactive character of the oxygen atoms which are
now part of the surface oxide. All these facts indicate a relatively
inert character of the surface, which agrees well with the exper-
imentally observed low reactivity of the larger Ag nanoparticles.
As for the selectivity, we ﬁnd a completely different behavior with
respect to the low oxygen coverage situation; now the energy bar-
rier towards acrolein production is actually higher (0.62 eV) than
the one for propylene oxide production (0.54 eV). We interpret this
ﬁnding in terms of the absence of reactive oxygen species in the
vicinity of the OMC intermediate, caused by the special structure of
the surface oxide. The only oxygen atom available for oxygen trans-
fer lies actually subsurface, and it costs a sizable amount of energy
to drive it upwards towards the propylene OMC methyl group. In
addition, we have also checked other reaction pathways involv-
ing direct reaction between the methyl group of “intact” adsorbed
propylene (inset to the right in Fig. 16b) and neighboring oxygen
atoms, but they turned out to be unfeasible due to the lack of a C–O
covalent bond (present in the OMC case) which helps on stabilizing
the ﬁnal state.
5.3.4. Interactions of propylene or propylene/oxygen mixture at
Ag particle edges: high oxygen coverage
Finally, we have considered the case of nanoparticle edge sites
at high oxygen coverage; we employ again the one-dimensional
rod model system, saturating one of its edges with adsorbed oxy-
gen atoms. The results are shown in Fig. 17. We ﬁnd that, after
fully relaxing the model system, very important surface recon-
structions occur, although the local chemical features at the edge
atoms are not qualitatively changed; as in the case of low cover-
age, two oxygen atoms are placed at each of the sides of the Ag
edge atoms. Interestingly, the overall features of the edge reac-
tivity and selectivity do not strongly change with respect to the

Dashed and full lines represent, respectively, pathways for acrolein or propylene
oxide formation. The inset to the right shows the Transition State for acrolein for-
mation, and the upper inset the TS for propene oxide formation. The lower inset

low coverage case, with a similar propylene OMC stability, and
a preference towards acrolein formation (with, actually, a larger
difference between the values of the barriers). Comparing this
situation with the Ag1.83O/Ag(1 1 1) case, the most striking differ-
ence (which causes the selectivity towards acrolein to drastically
change) is the availability of exposed reactive oxygen adatoms in
the vicinity of the propylene OMC. This fact is caused, as it can be
seen in the relaxed structures, by the special topology and irregu-
larities introduced by the presence of such defect-like edge sites.
5.3.5. Discussion of the theoretical results
Overall, the results from the DF simulations agree with the
behavior observed in the experiments. At low temperature, where
the oxygen coverage is relatively low, and surface oxides do not
form, propylene oxide formation is hindered by large activation
barriers, compared to the ones involved for acrolein formation.
We must remark, however, that the process of hydrogen abstrac-
tion from the propene methyl group involves the presence of two
neighbouring oxygen adatoms (one being involved in the propene
oxametallacycle formation, and another one reacting with the –CH3
group), suggesting that moderate oxygen coverages are necessary
to make this process feasible. On silver nanoparticle edges, we ﬁnd
a similar preference for acrolein formation, although the difference
in reaction barrier heights for both processes is now much smaller.
Above 100 ◦C we have the formation of surface oxides on the
particle surfaces. Unfortunately, the situation is very complex:
experiments [55,56,97,111] show that there is probably a mix-
ture of different structures. We can reasonably hypothesize the
presence of a substantial number of subsurface oxygen atoms. In
our simulations, we ﬁnd the energy barrier for acrolein formation
larger than the barrier for the formation of propylene oxide. This
is due to the extensive rearrangements that must take place for
H-abstraction on these extended (1 1 1) surfaces. The formation
of propene oxametallacycle intermediates involves reaction with
oxygen adatoms in the topmost layer, with only subsurface oxy-
gen neighbours. The formation of acrolein must necessarily occur
through diffusion of subsurface oxygen species, which requires
a large amount of energy. It is important to remark that reac-
tion pathways for acrolein formation involving direct reaction of
adsorbed propene with neigbouring oxygen surface adatoms were
also studied, but the barriers involved were even larger; from this
fact, an important conclusion can be reached: the OMC complex
serves as a reaction intermediate for both propylene oxide and
acrolein formation. Therefore we can conclude that in the case
of large particles, where such extended surfaces are dominant,
PO desorption becomes competitive with H-abstraction and hence
the PO/acrolein ratio strongly increases above 100 ◦C, in agree-
ment with experimental observations. For the smaller particles,
the greater presence of edges, kinks, defects in general, probably
implies a more irregular oxygen distribution making that oxygen
atoms are still (at least in part) available for H-abstraction. PO for-
mation in the ﬁnal products hence increases but does not become
dominant. Upon modelling a small oxidized Ag nanoparticle (see
insets in Fig. 17), we ﬁnd a strong stability for oxygen adatoms
placed at both sides of the nanoparticle edge. The existence of such
special arrangement allows now for reduced energy barriers in the
process leading to acrolein formation, which effectively results in a
reduced PO/acrolein ratio, in agreement with experimental obser-
vations.
In passing we note that the reaction mechanisms by very small,
sub-nanometer size clusters can be very different from those
occurring on few-nanometer particles or extended surfaces. The
presence of a dominant number of under-coordinated sites is in
fact known to modify substantially the chemistry of these sys-
tems [23,25,26,116]. These concepts have been reﬁned by a more
detailed analysis of the cluster frontier orbitals, from which basic
principles for alkene epoxidation by very small Au clusters have
been derived by Metiu and co-workers [34], while the question of
the relevance of surface defectivity on the cluster catalytic activity
has also been the subject of some attention, see e.g. Ref. [117]. It is
also important to note that this study was focused on the catalytic
oxidation of propene to propylene oxide with molecular oxygen,
in the absence of any additives or promoters. The only co-product
observed was acrolein, another valuable commodity chemical. Our
results show that by proper choice of the size of the silver clusters
either propylene oxide or acrolein can be efﬁciently produced, with
high selectivity and under mild reaction conditions.
6. Summary
Highly monodispersed model silver nanocatalyst with three
average lateral diameters (23.3, 12, and 8.7 nm) were prepared by
size-selected cluster deposition on amorphous alumina ﬁlms and
their size-dependent catalytic performance was studied for the par-
tial oxidation of propylene under realistic reaction conditions. All
clusters tested were very stable up to 200 ◦C, without any signs
of sintering under reaction conditions. Smaller clusters (8.7 and
12 nm) preferentially produced acrolein, while the 23.3 nm large
particles were considerably more selective towards the forma-
tion of propylene oxide. The observed reaction rates considerably
exceeded previously reported rates for larger silver particles. The
activity of clusters dropped signiﬁcantly with increasing particle
size, with an about order of magnitude change in the ratio between
propylene oxide and acrolein produced. The different speciﬁcities
and temperature dependences of the TOR for the smaller versus the
larger clusters studied indicate a change in reaction mechanism as
a function of size.
Using HRETEM and GISAXS, the surface crystallinity of the clus-
ters were investigated both in vacuum and under realistic catalytic
conditions. These results indicate a changing surface crystal struc-
ture for the particles under reaction conditions. Density-functional
calculations of the activation energies for oxygen adsorption and
its dissociation, at variable surface coverages on each silver plane
yielded surface energies which resulted in particle shapes consis-
tent with experimentally observed morphologies of the partially
oxidized silver clusters. Moreover, the changing crystal plane sta-
bilities are consistent with particle shape changes due to changing
plane areas.

The activation barriers calculated for the formation of propy-
lene oxide and acrolein on various facets and on the edges of
the silver clusters provided detailed insights into the compet-
ing reaction pathways leading to the size/morphology dependent
theoretical activity and selectivity, in good agreement with exper-
imental observations. The combined experimental and theoretical
results point towards a new class of highly selective silver-based
partial oxidation catalysts that works under mild reaction condi-
tions and with molecular oxygen.
