Enevoldsen et al. Reply: In Ref. [1], from simultaneously
recorded atomic force microscopy and STM images and
density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we showed
that hydrogen species could be atomically resolved in the
surface and subsurface of rutile TiO2. To explain an ap-
parent tip-assisted movement of H atoms between the two
sites, we predicted a barrier for hydrogen to diffuse directly
from bridging oxygen (Ob) on TiO2 (110) to a subsurface
site (Osub) of 2.4 eV for a H coverage of 1=8 ML using
DFT. This barrier is in agreement with the 2.6 eV given in
recent calculations for a higher coverage of 1 ML in
Ref.
[2], but is
now questioned in the preceding
Comment, Ref. [3]. A number of studies, Refs. [2–4],
suggest that a lower energy path via an intermediate in-
plane oxygen site (O3f) exists. For a coverage of 2 ML the
barrier is predicted to be 1.1 eV [4], and for a coverage of
1 ML it is further reduced to 0.9 eV [2].
To investigate whether the alternative path has the low-
est energy for the low coverage case (<0:1 ML) reﬂecting
the experimental conditions in Ref. [1], we calculated it
using the same methodology [1,5]. Speciﬁcally, DFT cal-
culations were performed using the plane wave VASP code
[6] with the local spin density approximation plus Hubbard
U [ðLSDAÞ þ U] method, which was shown to give better
agreement with experiments [5,7]. In order to see if the
functional plays a role in the size of the barrier, we also
calculated it using the standard generalized gradient ap-
proximation (GGA) method.
Our results (see Fig. 1) show that the barrier for Ob to
O3f is around 1.0 eV for the GGA functional, but there is
no local minimum at the O3f site with LSDA þ U.
However, in both cases the rate determining barrier is
found when passing through the Ti-O plane, and this is
about 1.6 eV for GGA and 1.8 eV for LSDA þ U. This is
lower than the original prediction of Ref. [1], which was
likely overestimated due to constraints on the migration
path. The barriers remain signiﬁcantly higher than the
predictions of Refs. [2,4], and assuming the barrier for
the total path was also considered, the difference must be
due to the higher coverages. However, we also speculate
that Calatayud et al. [3] might have neglected to include
the reaction energy from Ob to O3f to the energy barrier
from O3f to Osub. In any case, the fact that the barrier is
smaller than originally considered actually strengthens the
conclusion of our Letter [1] that H is manipulated to a
subsurface site.
We disagree with the interpretation of room temperature
behavior in the Comment [3]. Regardless of the H cover-
age, calculations predict a diffusion barrier of at least 1 eV.
This value is too high for thermally activated processes to
be active at room temperature, and spontaneous diffusion
of H should be an extremely rare process. Indeed, the
dynamics of surface H was studied experimentally in
high statistical detail in recent fast STM studies (e.g.,
[8]). Here, the removal or displacement of H adatoms,
other than through a surface reaction, was never observed.
