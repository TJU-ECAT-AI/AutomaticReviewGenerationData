Palladium/ceria exhibits unique catalytic activity for hydrocarbon oxidation; however, the chemical and
structural properties of active sites on the palladium–ceria surface are difﬁcult to characterize. Strong
interactions between palladium and the ceria support stabilize oxidized Pdd+ species, which may contrib-
ute to the signiﬁcant activity of Pd/ceria for methane oxidation. We present a density functional theory
(DFT + U) investigation into methane oxidation over Pd/ceria and quantify the activity of the
PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) mixed oxide surface in comparison with the PdO(1 0 0) and Pd(1 1 1) surfaces. The
methane activation barrier is lowest over the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface, even lower than over the
Pd(1 1 1) surface or low coordinated stepped or kinked Pd sites. Subsequent reaction steps in complete
oxidation, including product desorption and vacancy reﬁlling, are considered to substantiate that meth-
ane activation remains the rate-limiting step despite the low barrier over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1). The low bar-
rier over the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface demonstrates that mixed ceria-noble metal oxides offer the
potential for improved hydrocarbon oxidation performance with respect to dispersed noble metal parti-
cles on ceria.

1. Introduction
Ceria offers unique properties as a heterogeneous catalyst sup-
port or active component, of which the redox properties [1–4] and
methane oxidation activity [5,6] can be altered by the addition of
low levels of noble metals such as palladium. The oxidation state
and morphology of Pd species on Pd/ceria are a function of
preparation method [5,7–12] and catalytic operating conditions
[7,12–14]. Palladium can be supported on ceria as metal particles
[12,15] or PdOx species [8,11,16], and strong interactions between
Pd and the ceria support may stabilize a surface mixed oxide phase
(PdxCe1xOy) [5,13,17]. Each of the chemically distinct Pd species
on Pd/ceria likely provides unique catalytic activity; however,
which sites contribute to the signiﬁcant activity for methane oxi-
dation are unclear. Computational methods have been used to
probe the relative stability of Pd species on ceria [5,13] and to eval-
uate elementary reaction energies for methane oxidation over pure
CeO2 [18]; however, the catalytic activity of ceria-supported Pd
species has not been investigated. We present a computational
investigation, utilizing density functional theory, into methane
complete oxidation over the CeO2(1 1 1), PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1), and
PdO(1 0 0) surfaces, in comparison with C–H activation on Pd me-
tal surfaces. The reaction barrier for methane oxidation is lowest
over the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface, suggesting that this Pd/ceria
surface mixed oxide provides unusually high catalytic activity.
Our results detail the rate-determining steps and stable intermedi-
ates for methane oxidation over each surface.
The oxidation state of palladium and the morphology of the pal-
ladium surface are strongly a function of catalytic operating condi-
tions, which complicates characterization efforts to elucidate the
nature of the active site for methane oxidation. Ex situ character-
ization can be used to determine the Pd oxidation state before
and after reaction; however, these efforts illustrate further the
complexity in determining the structure and functionality of the
active phase. Hoﬂund et al. report ELS and XPS spectroscopy results
which show that PdO forms during methane combustion on palla-
dium powder [19]. The bulk transition for PdO decomposition to Pd
occurs at approximately 1070 K in 1 atm O2 [20]; however, oxida-
tion of small Pd particles may occur at lower temperatures. Ribeiro
et al. show that PdO decomposes to Pd at 907 K in 1.5 torr O2, and
that this transition results in an order of magnitude drop in the
methane combustion turnover rate [21]. Thus, depending upon
the temperature and oxygen pressure, Pd or PdO species may be
stable, with dramatic effects on catalytic activity. For Pd on ceria,
the dependence of the stable surface structure and oxidation state
on reaction conditions is even more complex, as Pd, PdO, or
PdxCe1xOy may be stable during reaction.
The morphology and oxidation state of Pd on ceria are both
strong functions of synthesis and pretreatment methods, and
strong interactions between Pd and ceria stabilize oxidized Pd

species. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that Pd/
ceria prepared by deposition–precipitation had a higher concentra-
tion of cationic Pdd+ sites than Pd/ceria prepared by wet impregna-
tion [8]. Preparation of Pd/ceria by solution-combustion synthesis
methods can facilitate mixing of Pd atoms into the CeO2 lattice
framework [5,17]. A combination of XPS, X-ray diffraction (XRD),
and extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS) results was
used to determine that Pd/ceria prepared by solution-combustion
synthesis contains Pd2+ cations incorporated into cubic ﬂuorite
CeO2 as a solid solution, whereas wet impregnation results in sam-
ples containing primarily metallic Pd [17]. Colussi et al. also re-
cently reported that surface solid solutions of Pd2+/CeOx with
distinct short and long range order can be prepared by solution-
combustion synthesis [5]. High-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) and DFT calculations conﬁrm that their
Pd2+/CeOx samples consist of a reconstructed CeO2(1 1 0) surface
with Pd2+ ions substituted for Ce4+ [5].
Palladium is an active catalyst for methane oxidation [19,21],
and the interaction between Pd and a ceria support facilitates un-
ique oxidation activity [5]. The oxidation rate on Pd/ceria exceeds
the rate over pure ceria, with particularly high catalytic activity
displayed by Pd/ceria catalysts containing oxidized Pdd+ species
or Pd–O–Ce linkages. For the direct oxidation of methane in a solid
oxide fuel cell (SOFC), the addition of 1 wt.% Pd to a pure ceria an-
ode increased the maximum power density by a factor of 10 [6].
The rate of methane combustion on Pd2+/CeOx mixed surface oxi-
des of 1 and 1.71 wt.% Pd was nearly twice that of Pd/ceria samples
of equivalent composition prepared by incipient wetness [5]. De-
spite numerous studies illustrating the catalytic activity of Pd/ceria
for methane oxidation, characterization of active sites is chal-
lenged by the heterogeneity of the metal/metal oxide structure
and structural changes which may occur during reaction. The com-
putational chemistry methods utilized herein probe the catalytic
activity of CeO2, PdxCe1xO2, PdO, and Pd to isolate the contribu-
tions of each to the overall oxidation performance of Pd/ceria
catalysts.
Computational chemistry methods can directly evaluate the rel-
ative energies of elementary reaction steps and activation barriers
on heterogeneous supported catalysts; however, applying these
methods to study catalytic reactions on ceria has been limited to
the consideration of simple redox reaction mechanisms. Previous
computational studies of hydrocarbon chemistry on ceria have fo-
cused on evaluating elementary reaction energies for CO oxidation
[18,22,23] and H2/H2O cycling [24,25] on pure CeO2, as well as CO
oxidation on CeO2 doped with single transition metal atoms such
as Au, Ag, Cu [26], and Zr [27]. The structural changes that result
from doping as well as the effects of doping on reducibility have
also been investigated using DFT methods for noble metal atoms
such as Pd [28] and Pt [29]. Knapp et al. evaluated the reaction en-
ergy
diagram
for
methane
combustion
to
CO2
over
pure
CeO2(1 1 1) [18], though the reaction energetics in the presence
of added transition or noble metals was not considered. Herein,
we report the reaction energetics for the oxidation of CH4 to CO2
over Pd/ceria to establish a complete methane oxidation cycle
and quantify changes in catalytic activity upon formation of
PdxCe1xO2. We compare the reaction energetics over CeO2(1 1 1)
and PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) to those over PdO(1 0 0) and Pd to distin-
guish the catalytic activity of the Pd/ceria mixed oxide from that
of other Pd species.
Our previous study used ab initio thermodynamics to evaluate
the stability of different Pd species on CeO2(1 1 1), (1 1 0), and
(1 0 0)
surfaces.
Under
varying
operating
conditions,
the
PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface is stable with respect to other single
atom states of Pd on the CeO2(1 1 1) surface [13]. The oxygen va-
cancy formation energy on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is less endothermic
than on CeO2(1 1 1), and the methane activation barrier is lower
over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) than over CeO2(1 1 1). This work utilizes
density functional theory to calculate the reaction free energies
of elementary steps in methane oxidation over CeO2(1 1 1),
PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1), and PdO(1 0 0) in comparison with C–H activa-
tion on Pd metal sites. These models represent the surface facets
of
a

palladium/ceria

(PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1)),
or

(PdO(1 0 0))
particle,
respectively. Evaluation of the oxidation mechanism over each of
these surfaces facilitates comparison between the catalytic activity
of Pd/ceria mixed oxides, PdO, and Pd metal. Regardless of the ini-
tial oxidation state, the oxidation state of Pd cycles between either
Pd0/Pd2+ or Pd2+/Pd4+ during the full reaction turnover of methane
oxidation. We report the activation barriers, rate-determining
steps, and stable intermediates for methane oxidation over each
surface, with discussion of adsorption sites and adsorbate geome-
tries. We use ab initio thermodynamics to evaluate the dependence
of rate-determining steps and the overall reaction mechanism on
catalytic operating conditions including temperature and partial
pressure of reactants and products. We speciﬁcally consider oper-
ating regimes corresponding to catalytic combustion experiments
and SOFC operation.
2. Methods
2.1. Electronic structure method
Calculations were made using the Vienna ab initio simulation
program (VASP), an ab initio total-energy and molecular dynamics
program developed at the Institute for Material Physics at the Uni-
versity of Vienna [30–32]. The projector augmented wave method
[33] was used to represent the core region, with valence electron
wavefunctions expanded in a tractable plane wave basis set. The
energy cutoffs of the plane wave basis sets used herein were
400 eV, 450 eV, and 500 eV for Pd metal, CeO2, and PdO, respec-
tively (chosen to ensure convergence of total energy with respect
to energy cutoff). Valence conﬁgurations were 5s25p66s24f15d1
for cerium, 2s22p4 for oxygen, 4d10 for Pd, 2s22p2 for C, and 1s1
for H. Structural optimizations were performed by minimizing
the forces on all atoms to below 0.05 eV Å1, and all calculations
for
CeO2
and
PdO
were
spin-polarized.
The
Perdew–Wang
(PW91) version of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
was used to incorporate exchange and correlation energies [34].
Due to well-established difﬁculties within DFT to accurately
represent the nature of 4f states in ceria [35–37], we implemented
the DFT + U approach. The DFT + U method introduces the Hubbard
U term as an on-site Coulombic interaction in the f states of ceria,
which properly localizes electrons in these states for reduced ceria
structures (CeO2x, or more generally Ce3þ
x Ce4þ
1xOy). We do not di-
rectly consider ceria surfaces reduced by oxygen vacancies herein;
however, our previous study illustrated that the adsorption of H
atoms and CH3 groups on pure CeO2 reduces surface Ce4+ cations
to Ce3+ [38]. We used a value of U = 5 eV, which is consistent with
recommended values within the DFT + U method used in previous
studies of ceria [18,28,39–42]. Our previous study included evalu-
ation of the dependence of methane activation and oxygen vacancy
formation on the value of the Hubbard U term on CeO2 and
PdxCe1xO2. For pure CeO2, the vacancy formation energy and
methane adsorption energy increase in exothermicity linearly with
increasing U value (DEvac and DEads are proportional to 0.4DU (eV))
[38]. Given the dependence of vacancy formation energy and
adsorption energy on the U value for pure ceria, the quantitative
values we calculate are inherently dependent on our speciﬁc
choice of U value. For PdxCe1xO2, the vacancy formation energy
and methane adsorption energy become less exothermic with
increasing U value, however, with much less dependence on U

17
value than for pure ceria as Pd4+ is reduced rather than Ce4+ (DEvac
and DEads are proportional to 0.05DU (eV)) [38]. We use a U value
of 5 eV to accurately describe the electronic structure of reduced
ceria, and the qualitative comparisons of reaction energies we re-
port over PdxCe1xO2 and Pd or PdO are not sensitive to the Ce 4f
U value.
2.2. Surface models
Fig. 1 displays the slab models used for the CeO2(1 1 1),
PdxCe1xO2 (1 1 1), and PdO(1 0 0). The mirrored slab model in-
cludes symmetrical adsorbates on both sides of the slab. The ceria
surface is modeled as a 12-layer (Ce16O32) mirrored slab of the
(1 1 1) termination of cubic ﬂuorite CeO2 separated by 15 Å of vac-
uum in the direction perpendicular to the surface. The surface en-
ergy of CeO2(1 1 1) is lowest among single crystal terminations of
ceria [38–40], indicating that this surface termination will repre-
sent a large portion of a polycrystalline CeO2 surface. The mirrored
slab model of the ceria surface was used speciﬁcally to minimize
slab-to-slab interactions that may result from a large net surface
dipole moment upon the interaction of the surface with adsorbates
and the reduction in surface metal ions. The Brillouin zone was
sampled using a (2  2  1) MP grid for the (1 1 1) surface, with
the third vector perpendicular to the surface. We use a p(2  2)
expansion of the surface unit cell, which results in a termination
of four surface oxygen atoms on each side of the slab and four Ce
atoms in the atomic layer below.
The PdO(1 0 0) surface was modeled as a slab of tetragonal pal-
ladium (II) oxide (PdO), respectively, also separated by 15 Å of vac-
uum in the direction perpendicular to the surface. The lattice
parameters of bulk PdO were optimized within 2% of the corre-
sponding experimentally determined value [43,44]. We used a 9-
layer mirrored slab with a (2  1) expansion to model the
PdO(1 0 0) surface, with all layers allowed to relax during struc-
tural optimizations. Schefﬂer et al. used DFT and ab initio thermo-
dynamics to show that the surface formation energy of the (1 0 0)
termination of PdO is less endergonic than all other single crystal
terminations of PdO at O2 pressures above 1030 atm at 300 K
[45], motivating its use in this study.
Methane activation barriers are also reported over Pd(1 1 1) and
Pd/CeO2 model systems to provide comparison to the Pd0 oxida-
tion state. Description of these models is included in the Supple-
mentary material.
2.3. Reaction free energies
Reaction intermediates for methane oxidation over each surface
were optimized by placing one adsorbate of the formula C1HxOy
(with 0 6 x 6 2 and 0 6 y 6 2), or an isolated H atom adsorbate,
in each surface unit cell. For each C1HxOy adsorbate, the O in
C1HxOy corresponds to oxygen bound to the carbon atom which
is not lattice oxygen of the stoichiometric surface. Each adsorbate
was placed at all high symmetry adsorption sites and conﬁgura-
tions on each surface, and the lowest energy adsorption conﬁgura-
tion for each adsorbate–surface pair was used to calculate the
relative energies of elementary reaction steps. Using one adsorbate
per unit cell results in a relatively low coverage of reaction inter-
mediates. For example, H on CeO2(1 1 1) consists of an H atom ad-
sorbed atop one of the four surface oxygen atoms in the unit cell,
corresponding to an effective H coverage of 25%. Therefore, reac-
tion energies and analysis reported herein approximate the low
coverage limit for methane oxidation. Harmonic vibrational modes
were calculated to determine zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE)
corrections to the total energy of isolated molecules and adsorbed
species. Optimizations of isolated gas-phase molecules were per-
formed with one free molecule within a 15  15  15 Å unit cell.
The free energies of gas-phase molecules and surface adsorbates
were calculated as the sum of the electronic energy (EDFT), ZPVE
correction, entropy (ST), and a pressure volume term (PV) as
follows:
Ggas ¼ EDFT þ ZPVE  ðSvib þ Strans þ Srot þ SelecÞT þ PV
ð1Þ
For surface adsorbates, translational and rotational entropy terms
are zero, and the electronic term is included only for gas-phase oxy-
gen. Constrained vibrational calculations were done for adsorbed
species, where the Hessian matrix is populated solely with the sec-
ond derivatives of energy with respect to position of the adsorbate
atoms. Conﬁgurational entropies of adsorbed species were ne-
glected as they are less than 0.02 eV in all cases. Free energy differ-
ences for elementary reaction steps were calculated by subtracting
the sum of free energies of the initial state from the sum of free
energies of the product state, as follows for the example of CH3 dis-
sociation to adsorbed CH2 and H fragments (CH

CH2, H, and CH3 species, respectively, and Gbare is the DFT energy
of the bare surface. The denominator of two is included in Eq. (2)
for energies calculated over the CeO2(1 1 1), PdO(1 0 0), Pd/
CeO2(1 1 1), and PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surfaces to account for the fact
that mirrored slab models are used with one adsorbate on each side
of the mirrored slab. Partial oxidation as well as total combustion
pathways involving C–H breaking, O–H forming, and C–O forming
steps were considered over the various surface models.
To evaluate the minimum energy path for methane oxidation
ðCH4 þ 2O2 ! CO2 þ 2H2OÞ over each surface, we also considered
the formation energy of CO2(g) and H2O(g) from reaction interme-
diates. Water is formed by adsorption of H atoms on surface oxy-
gen atoms followed by desorption of H2O(g) to leave a surface
oxygen vacancy. The formation energy of H2O(g) from H was cal-
culated on the CeO2(1 1 1), PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1), and PdO(1 0 0) sur-
faces, as:
DGH2O formation ¼ ½2  GH2O þ Gvacant þ Gbare  2  GH

ð3Þ
where GH is the free energy of adsorbed H (Eq. (1)), GH2O is the free
energy of H2O(g) (Eq. (1)), and Gvacant is the DFT energy of the sur-
face containing an oxygen vacancy on each side of the mirrored
slab. Water formation steps are included in the reaction energy dia-
grams reported herein as elementary steps immediately following
C–H breaking steps which result in H formation. For example, we
consider the following three elementary steps for the dissociation
of CH3 to CH2 CH

The consideration of product formation and vacancy ﬁlling
sequentially throughout the mechanism can be contrasted with
the approach of Knapp et al. [18]. Knapp et al. included all water
formation energies at the ﬁnal step and neglected vacancy ﬁlling
in their analysis of the reaction energy diagram for methane oxida-
tion over pure CeO2(1 1 1). The authors report that the ﬁnal step in
the catalytic cycle for total methane oxidation over CeO2(1 1 1) is
½4H ! 2H2OðgÞ þ 2V €
O with DE ¼ þ4:6 eV [18]. Their analysis of
methane oxidation does not consider the complete catalytic cycle
by neglecting oxygen vacancy ﬁlling and implies that the rate-
determining step for methane oxidation over ceria is water forma-
tion with an apparent barrier of nearly 450 kJ/mol (+4.6 eV). Our
method of incorporating elementary steps for water formation into
the reaction energy diagram for methane oxidation represents con-
tinuous water formation from H during the overall reaction.
2.4. Methane activation barriers
The majority of our analysis compares elementary reaction
energies between surfaces. Activation barriers were computed for
only C–H bond activation of methane. We do not calculate energy
barriers for any reaction step following methane activation, as
Knapp et al. show that the energy barrier for each C–H breaking
step subsequent to methane activation is lower than the barrier
for methane activation over the clean CeO2(1 1 1) surface [18].
We use a 3  3 unit cell to calculate the methane activation barrier
on Pd(1 1 1) to accommodate both CH3 and H within the unit cell.
The climbing image nudged elastic band method (CI-NEB) [46–48]
was used to isolate transition states and calculate reaction energy
barriers for methane activation ðCH4ðgÞ ! CH
3 þ HÞ. Within the
CI-NEB method, a sequence of images along the reaction path are
optimized with the highest energy image required to climb up in
energy along the elastic band to estimate the saddle point along
the minimum energy path [47]. Four equally spaced images be-
tween reactant and product states were used in each search (six
images total), and transition states were identiﬁed as the maxi-
mum energy image with an absolute tangential force of less than
0.04 eV Å1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Reaction free energy diagrams for methane oxidation
The reaction free energy of each elementary step in methane
oxidation over each surface is calculated at 0 K as well as at cata-
lytic combustion conditions. Each reaction free energy diagram
presented herein is calculated at T = 298 K and PCH4 = 0.01 atm,
PO2 = 0.04 atm, PH2O = PCO2 = 106 atm, to represent typical experi-
mental catalytic combustion conditions at 0% conversion [8,49].
Reaction free energies are calculated at T = 298 K as this tempera-
ture corresponds to the low conversion (low T) region of the meth-
ane oxidation light-off curve over CeO2 [49,50]. The methane
activation barriers displayed in each reaction free energy diagram
are calculated as the Gibbs free energy of activation (DzG) at these
catalytic combustion conditions, relative to the free energy of
CH4(g):
DzG ¼ GTSðGCH4ðgÞ þ GÞ
ð4Þ
In each reaction energy diagram presented herein, intermediate
energies are referenced to the free energy of CH4(g) + 2O2(g). Table
1 displays the barriers at 0 K (Eact) and the standard Gibbs free en-
ergy of activation DzG0 (at 273 K and PCH4 = 1.0 atm) for methane
activation on each surface. Table 2 displays the reaction free ener-
gies for each step in methane oxidation at 0 K. Adsorption geome-
tries for all adsorbates on each surface are provided in the
Supplementary material. The reaction free energy diagram for
methane oxidation on Pd/CeO2(1 1 1) is also included in the Sup-
plementary material.

tiﬁed this higher-energy transition state. This transition state for

sition state precedes the CH3 + H state along the reaction coordi-
nate, with the C–H bond elongated and the O–H bond partially
formed. The reaction free energy for ðCH4ðgÞ ! CH

slightly exergonic at 0.14 eV; however, each subsequent C–H
breaking step over pure ceria is endergonic (with the most ender-
gonic step HCO ? CO ? H at +0.71 eV). Each water formation

is exergonic by 2.44 eV (4.88 eV per V €

over the hydroxylated surface was not considered as the barrier
would be expected to increase. We instead presume that water
desorption and vacancy reﬁlling by oxygen must precede C–H acti-
vation in the catalytic cycle.
Each CHx species (1 6 x 6 3) adsorbs atop a surface oxygen atom
on CeO2(1 1 1), with elongation of each adjacent Ce–O bond. The

z. This result is similar to
the ﬁndings of previous DFT + U studies of CO adsorption on ceria
[51,52]. Carbon dioxide adsorption to CeO2(1 1 1) is equivalent to
CO2

formation on an oxygen vacancy. However, carbonate forma-
tion is not preferable as it is more exergonic for CO to desorb as
CO2(g) (1.04 eV at 298 K) than to form CO
2 (0.61 eV at 298 K).
Intermediates including CH3O, CH3OH, H2CO, H2COH, HCOH,
C, and HCOO were also considered. The formation of each of these
was endergonic with respect to other intermediates along the low-
est energy path.
Stable intermediates along the lowest energy path were identi-
ﬁed as those for which the subsequent reaction step is uphill (end-
ergonic)
in
free
energy.
The
‘‘most
stable
intermediate’’
is
identiﬁed as the intermediate from which the subsequent reaction
step in the most endergonic. The most stable intermediate over
CeO2(1 1 1) is HCO, which adsorbs with the carbon atom atop a
surface oxygen, and is equivalent to formate (HCOO) adsorbed
atop an oxygen vacancy. Diffuse reﬂection infrared Fourier trans-
form spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis conﬁrmed the presence and
stability of surface formates on ceria during low-temperature
water–gas shift reaction conditions [53,54]. These DRIFTS studies
determine the stretching bands for formate on ceria to be
2950 cm1 for C–H stretch and 1580 cm1 for O–C–O asymmetric
stretching [53,54]; we calculate 2970 cm1 for C–H stretch and
1599 cm1 for O–C–O asymmetric stretching. Stable intermediates
other than HCO on CeO2(1 1 1) include CH
3, CH
2, and H. The sta-
bility of CH
3 and CH
2 is further evidence of C–H breaking activity as
the limiting factor in hydrocarbon oxidation activity. The stability
of H suggests that hydroxyl groups will be present on the ceria
surface during reaction. The formation energies of partial oxidation

products such as methanol (CH3OH), formaldehyde (H2CO), and
formic acid (H2COOH) were thermodynamically unfavorable at
both 0 K and catalytic combustion conditions compared to further
steps toward total oxidation (CO2) and thus are not included in the
minimum energy path over CeO2(1 1 1).
3.1.2. Methane oxidation on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1)
Fig. 4 displays the reaction free energy diagram for methane
oxidation on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) at catalytic combustion conditions.
Methane adsorption on PdxCe1xO2 proceeds through H abstraction
by a surface oxygen atom to form CH3, followed by adsorption of
CH3 [38]. Subsequent ﬁner searches along the reaction coordinate
over
PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1)
(equivalent
to
our
approach
over
CeO2(1 1 1)) indicated a monotonic increase in energy between
CH4(g) and (CH3 + H), in contrast to the higher-energy transition
state between these two states found on pure ceria. The free en-
ergy (DzG) of the (CH3 + H) state over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is
+0.70 eV (Eact = +0.18 eV at 0 K [38]) with respect to CH4(g), sub-
stantially lower than that over pure ceria (DzG = +1.85 eV, Eact =
+1.40 eV at 0 K).
Each C–H breaking step over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is more exergonic
than the corresponding step over CeO2(1 1 1). The minimum en-
ergy path on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) follows the same intermediates as
for methane oxidation on CeO2(1 1 1) (i.e. C–H breaking to CH,
C–O forming to HCO, C–H breaking to CO, then desorption as
CO2 + V €
O). Carbon dioxide adsorbs equivalent to CO2
3
on an oxygen
vacancy on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1); however, it is exergonic for CO to
desorb as CO2(g) (0.34 eV at 298 K), whereas the formation of
CO
2 is endergonic (+0.13 eV at 298 K). Each CHx species (1 6 x 6
3) adsorbs atop a surface oxygen atom on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1), with
elongation of adjacent Pd–O and Ce–O bonds. Our previous study
of Pd-substituted ceria surfaces highlighted that Pd substitution in-
creases surface reducibility with respect to pure ceria and thereby
provides more active surface oxygen for oxidation reactions.
Adsorption of CHx and H on the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface results
in reduction of the incorporated Pd4+ species, which is more exo-
thermic than reduction of Ce4+ [38]. In the bare PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1)
surface, Pd4+ is approximately octahedrally coordinated by O
atoms, as expected based on crystal ﬁeld theory arguments for
the d6 metal center. Upon adsorption of H or CHx fragments, Pd–
O bonds lengthen, and speciﬁcally, elongation of a Pd–O subsurface
bond provides for a nearly square planar O environment about the
d8 Pd2+ atom. The Pd atom therefore provides the reduction center,
and incorporation into the CeO2 lattice provides for structural ﬂex-
ibility to stabilize both the Pd4+ and Pd2+ states.
The most stable intermediate over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is H, as
the only endergonic reaction steps following methane activation
are water formation steps. The formation energies of partial oxida-
tion products such as methanol (CH3OH), formaldehyde (H2CO),
and formic acid (H2COOH) were more endergonic than further
steps toward total oxidation (CO2) and thus are not included in
the minimum energy path over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1).
3.1.3. Methane oxidation on PdO(1 0 0)
Though
the
low
methane
activation
barrier
over
PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) suggests that incorporated Pd4+ ions in ceria pro-
vide high activity for methane oxidation, it is possible that the
active cationic Pd species identiﬁed experimentally correspond to
PdOx clusters. We use the PdO(1 0 0) surface to approximate the
surface of a PdO particle because the surface formation energy of
the (1 0 0) termination of PdO is less endergonic than all other sin-
gle crystal terminations of PdO at O2 pressures above 1030 atm at
300 K [45]. Fig. 5 displays the reaction energy diagram for methane
oxidation on PdO(1 0 0) at catalytic combustion conditions. Meth-
ane adsorption on PdO(1 0 0) occurs dissociatively with CH3 and H
fragments
adsorbing atop
surface
oxygen
atoms,
similar
to
methane dissociative adsorption on pure ceria [38]. Searches along
the reaction coordinate over PdO(1 0 0) indicated a monotonic
increase in energy between CH4(g) and (CH3 + H), and we approx-
imate the energy barrier for methane activation on PdO(1 0 0) as
the energy of CH4 ? CH3 + H (H abstraction and methyl radical
formation). Product or transition states that involved interaction
of H and CH3 fragments with surface Pd2+ were higher in energy
than that of H and CH
3 atop surface oxygen atoms. The free energy

of the CH3 + H state (DzG) is +1.58 eV (+1.08 eV at 0 K), lower than
over pure ceria and Pd/CeO2(1 1 1), but higher than that over
PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1).
Methane activation on PdO may also occur over coordinatively
unsaturated Pd atoms, either present near oxygen vacancies or
present on surfaces terminated by Pd with less than six-fold
oxygen coordination. Weaver et al. reported a DFT calculated
methane activation barrier of 0.65 eV on PdO(1 0 1) at 0 K via
metal insertion of a coordinatively unsaturated surface Pd atom
[55]. Methane dissociation over an oxygen vacancy on Pd(1 0 0)
is endergonic at +0.03 eV at 298 K, 0.4 eV more endergonic than
over the stoichiometric surface (0.37 eV at 298 K). The more end-
ergonic methane dissociation energy over PdO(1 0 0)/V €
O suggests
that methane activation over oxygen vacancies on PdO(1 0 0) is
not favorable relative to activation by H abstraction over the stoi-
chiometric surface. Methane activation transition state searches
over PdO(1 0 0)/V €
O indicate that activation via metal insertion does
not stabilize a transition state lower in energy than activation via H
abstraction over the intact PdO(1 0 0) surface. The activation
barrier and transition state over PdO(1 0 1) illustrate, however,
that methane activation can be facile over PdO surface termina-
tions which expose unsaturated Pd atoms of speciﬁc coordination
and geometry and that the methane activation barrier on PdO via
metal insertion is lower than via H abstraction on PdO(1 0 0).
Each C–H breaking step over PdO(1 0 0) is exergonic, with the
exception of HCO ? CO. Every C–H breaking step subsequent to
CH4 ! CH
3 þ H is more exergonic than over CeO2(1 1 1), but less
exergonic than over Pd/CeO2(1 1 1) or PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1). The min-
imum energy path on PdO(1 0 0) follows the same intermediates as
on each ceria surface, and each adsorbate sits atop one surface O
atom or bridged between two surface O atoms. The most stable
intermediate is CO, which binds strongly at a site bridging

between two surface oxygen and is equivalent to a carbonate ion,
CO2
3 , adsorbed on two adjacent oxygen vacancies. This adsorption
mode for CO is also equivalent to CO2 adsorbed on a single oxygen
vacancy; no stable adsorption site was found for CO2 on the intact
PdO(1 0 0) surface. The vacancy formation energy on PdO(1 0 0)
(+2.16 eV at 0 K) is less than that on CeO2(1 1 1) (+2.76 eV at 0 K)
or Pd/CeO2(1 1 1) (+2.64 eV at 0 K), and thus, water formation is
more exergonic and oxygen vacancy ﬁlling is more endergonic on
PdO than over CeO2(1 1 1) or Pd/CeO2(1 1 1). The formation of
partial oxidation products was prohibitively endergonic as found
for ceria-based surfaces.
3.1.4. Methane activation on Pd metal sites
Though the barrier for methane activation on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1)
is less than that for CeO2(1 1 1) or PdO(1 0 0), it is possible that re-
duced metal (Pd0) sites provide greater methane oxidation activity.
Hu et al. calculate the barrier over Pd(1 1 1) as 0.66 eV, with the
barrier over a Pd surface step (Pd(2 1 1)) as + 0.38 eV and over a
Pd surface kink (Pd vacancy on Pd(2 1 1)) as + 0.41 eV [56]. With
the same methods as used herein, we calculate the methane acti-
vation barrier over Pd(1 1 1) in a 3  3 unit cell to be +0.89 eV.
All of the values are signiﬁcantly higher than the barrier of
0.18 eV determined for methane activation over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1).
We also considered methane activation over a single Pd adatom on
ceria (Pd/CeO2(1 1 1)), as an extreme case for ideally dispersed
palladium on ceria. The methane activation barrier is +1.30 eV on
Pd/CeO2(1 1 1), higher than on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1), PdO(1 0 0), or
Pd metal surfaces. Adsorbed oxygen (O) will be present on the
Pd surface during reaction, and methane activation may also occur
over O species. Preliminary calculations indicate that the methane
activation reaction energy and barrier are higher over oxygen-cov-
ered Pd(1 1 1) than over Pd(1 1 1) or Pd steps or kinks.
Further description of the Pd(1 1 1) and Pd/CeO2(1 1 1) surface
models as well as full analysis of the methane oxidation reaction
mechanism over each surface is included in the Supplementary
material.
3.2. Dependence of rate-determining steps on operating conditions
We compare operating regimes for the catalytic combustion of
methane and methane electro-oxidation in a SOFC within which
distinct elementary steps over each surface are rate determining
(provide the largest energy barrier). The free energy of methane
activation (DzG), as well as the free energies of product desorption
steps, is a function of temperature and the partial pressures of
reactants and products, and thus, the rate-determining step is also
a function of temperature and partial pressures. For example, at
very high pressures of H2O(g) product, the desorption of H2O
may be more endergonic than any other elementary reaction en-
ergy or barrier. At low O2 pressures, oxygen vacancy ﬁlling will be-
come rate limiting. The DzG for methane activation is also
dependent on the methane pressure, with higher pressures reduc-
ing DzG. We implement Murdoch’s procedure [57] to identify the
rate-determining step of methane oxidation within each operating
regime. Murdoch’s procedure involves dividing the reaction free
energy diagram into sections of steadily decreasing free energy
and identifying the reaction sequence that passes through the larg-
est DG barrier of any given section as the rate-determining step
[57].
The partial pressures of reactants and products used to repre-
sent catalytic combustion reactor conditions at conversions greater
than 0% were ﬁxed by the stoichiometry of the overall reaction.
SOFC conditions were set as 973 K, 1 atm CH4 at the anode (pure
methane anode feed), and 0.21 atm O2 at the cathode (air cathode
feed), equivalent to experimental conditions in previous studies of
direct oxidation of hydrocarbons in SOFCs [58–60]. The partial
pressure of O2 at the anode was ﬁxed by the cell potential by the
Nernst relationship:

which can be rewritten for methane oxidation as:

path over CeO2(1 1 1) is rate determining:

Segments B and C represent H2O formation and vacancy ﬁlling,
respectively, each referenced to HCO since it is the most stable
intermediate over CeO2(1 1 1). At catalytic combustion conditions
(Fig. 6a), methane oxidation on CeO2(1 1 1) is rate limited by CH4
activation at all conversions. The regions of O2 and H2O pressures
within which water formation or vacancy ﬁlling is endergonic to
the extent that the rate-determining step is altered are character-
ized by extremely low O2 pressures (<1080 atm) and extremely
high H2O pressures (>1020 atm). At SOFC conditions, methane oxi-
dation over ceria is also rate limited by CH4 activation; however,
the region within which vacancy ﬁlling contributes to the rate-
determining step is much larger at the higher SOFC temperature;
the free energy of O2(g) is lower and thus vacancy ﬁlling is more
endergonic at higher temperatures.
Over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1), the methane activation barrier is lower
than over CeO2(1 1 1), and therefore, the conditions over which
H2O desorption or vacancy ﬁlling are limiting may be expected
to vary. Fig. 7 depicts the regions of O2 and H2O partial pressures
within which methane activation, water formation, or vacancy ﬁll-
ing over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is rate determining. Methane activation
is more exergonic over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) than over CeO2(1 1 1),
which contracts the region within which methane activation is rate
determining. Although this region is contracted, methane oxida-
tion remains rate limited by CH4 activation at all conditions of
interest over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1). The regions of H2O and O2 pres-
sures within which water formation and/or vacancy ﬁlling are rate
determining over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) are characterized by lower
H2O pressures and higher O2 pressures than over CeO2(1 1 1), be-
cause the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface is more reducible.
The comparison of rate-determining regions on PdxCe1x-
O2(1 1 1)
versus
CeO2(1 1 1)
illustrates
the
trade-off
in
the
development of ceria-based mixed oxide catalysts between surface
reducibility and C–H bond activity as established in our previous
study [38]. The incorporation of Pd4+ ions into the CeO2 lattice
increases the reducibility of the ceria surface and thereby the
catalytic activity for methane oxidation. Though the trade-off is
that increased reducibility will make vacancy ﬁlling more difﬁcult,
A.D. Mayernick, M.J. Janik / Journal of Catalysis 278 (2011) 16–25
23
vacancy ﬁlling is rate determining only at very low O2 (<1030 atm)
pressures at both 298 K and 973 K, suggesting that the catalysis of
hydrocarbon oxidation by ceria-based oxides is only dependent on
the energetics of C–H activation.
Plots depicting the dependence of rate-determining steps on
operating pressures at 298 K and 973 K for methane oxidation over
PdO(1 0 0), Pd(1 1 1), and Pd/CeO2(1 1 1) are included in the Sup-
plementary material. At both 298 K and 973 K, methane oxidation
is limited by C–H activation over PdO(1 0 0), Pd(1 1 1), and Pd/
CeO2(1 1 1) at all conversions.
4. Conclusions
The DFT + U method was used to calculate the free energies of
elementary
methane
oxidation
reaction
steps
over
pure
CeO2(1 1 1), PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1), and PdO(1 0 0). Methane oxidation
over Pd/ceria is limited by C–H activation, the barrier of which is
affected by the oxidation state, morphology, and chemical compo-
sition of the surface. At low coverage, methane oxidation occurs
over each surface via C–H breaking steps to CH, C–O forming to
form HCO (equivalent to HCOO- atop an oxygen defect for each
oxide surface), subsequent C–H breaking to CO, and ﬁnally C–O
formation and desorption as CO2(g). The formation of C is not fa-
vored over any surface, suggesting that, under the reaction condi-
tions considered, deactivation due to the formation of carbon
deposits is not likely. The formation of partial oxidation products
is also not thermodynamically favorable, which is in agreement
with the selectivity of ceria, palladium, and palladium/ceria for
the complete oxidation of CH4 to CO2.

ble 1 are the ratios of the rate constant over each surface to the rate
constant over CeO2(1 1 1). Methane activation is rate determining
over each surface, at both catalytic combustion and SOFC operating

stepped
Pd(2 1 1) [56], kinked Pd(2 1 1) [56], PdO(1 0 0), Pd/CeO2(1 1 1),
and CeO2(1 1 1). The relative rate of methane oxidation over
PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is three orders of magnitude larger than that over
stepped Pd(1 1 1) and much larger (>13 orders of magnitude) than
over Pd(1 1 1), CeO2(1 1 1), and PdO(1 0 0).
These results indicate that incorporated Pd4+ ions in ceria pro-
vide higher catalytic activity for methane oxidation than large Pd
particles
(Pd(1 1 1))
or
large
palladium
oxide
particles
(PdO(1 0 0)). An actual Pd/ceria catalyst will contain a heteroge-
neous distribution of surface sites, particle sizes, and Pd oxidation
states.
The

of

oxidation
over
PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) shows that, even if the concentration of incorpo-
rated Pd4+ atoms is 1000 times smaller than that of stepped or
kinked sites on metallic particles, the rate of methane oxidation
over incorporated Pd4+ will provide the majority of the overall
reaction rate. Stable intermediates differ over incorporated Pd4+
versus Pd0, Pd2+, or CeO2, and thus intermediates identiﬁed exper-
imentally may correspond to those present on less active sites than
Pd4+.
Our models represent the limits of ideally dispersed Pd4+ and
inﬁnitely large Pd or PdO particles. Experimental studies establish
the importance of Pd–O–Ce linkages and more generally oxidized
Pd species in dictating the catalytic activity of Pd/ceria; however,
these sites could exist on the edge of metal or PdO clusters. Consid-
eration of all possible particle sizes and morphologies is computa-
tionally prohibitive, and it is possible that highly active sites at the
boundary between PdOx particles and the CeO2 support could pro-
vide activity similar to incorporated PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1). This study
illustrates that mixed noble metal–ceria oxides can provide en-
hanced activity for hydrocarbon oxidation by tuning the reducibil-
ity of the mixed noble metal–ceria surface and thereby the
methane activation kinetics. These results provide insight into
the catalytic activity and surface functionality of Pd/ceria for
hydrocarbon oxidation and motivate future efforts in the develop-
ment of noble metal–ceria mixed oxide catalysts.
