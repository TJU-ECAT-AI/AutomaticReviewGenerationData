AND OTHERS. Discovery prob- 
lems in General Science. New York: College 
Entrance Book Company, 1950. 284 p. $0.90. 
This is a workbook for ninth grade general 
science. Its organization reflects the trend in re- 
cent textbooks and courses of study. A humorous 
cartoon to introduce and motivate the unit is 
effectively employed. There are plenty of simple 
demonstrations and activities. 
There are many 
illustrations in color.

Biology in Review. Chicago: Lyons and Car- 
naham, 1949. 405 p. 
This handbook is an excellent guide for the 
study of biology. There are fourteen units be- 
ginning with living cells and interrelationships 
and ending with conservation and distribution 
limitations covering both the plant and animal 
kingdoms. Each of the units has the more mod- 
ern teaching devices to stimulate thinking such as, 
“Some Things You Should Know,” Key Words, 
“A Test Yourself Experiment.”

verse. New York: 
The Macmillan Company, 
1950. 822 p. 
$4.75. 
This is the third edition of survey textbook of 
physical sciences for colleges. Physical science 
teachers who emphasize the importance of both 
information and development of scientific atti- 
tudes will find this book either an excellent text 
o
r
 reference. 
Some teachers will like its sys- 
tematic and functional approach. To that seem- 
ingly growing school of thought who disdain 
anything remotely resembling a functional ap- 
proach in the teaching of physical science courses 
as a phase of general education, this textbook 
would be not only useless but positively harmful.

College Biology. New York : 
Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1950. 806 p
,
 
College Biology is based on the following im- 
portant points: 1. emphasis on basic concepts, 
2. requirements of laboratory instruction, 3. mo- 
tivation of students, 4. development of scientific 
thinking, 5. need for student aids, and 6. pro- 
vision for the gifted student. 
The treatment of various phases of physiology, 
botany, and zoology seem quite adequate. Numer- 
ous illustrations and photographs supplemellt the 
textual material. Altogether it seems to be an 
excellent biology text which would also serve as a 
valuable reference for the high school biology 
teacher.

General Biology. New 
York : Appleton-Century-Crofts, Inc., 1950. 
This is the second edition of a text first pub- 
lished in 1942. The author states that “emphasis 
is placed on key principles and central concepts 
and on the evidence supporting them.”

ever possible biological discoveries are presented

with historical perspective. Some 150 new illus- 
trations have been added to this revised edition. 
There is increased stress placed on the human 
import of biological facts and principles. 
The content would seem most adequate to meet 
the needs of college students taking college bi- 
ology. 
The text would serve excellently as a 
reference in those courses using some other basic 
text, or not using any basic text at all. High 
school biology teachers, too, would find it an 
excellent reference for their courses. 
VILLFE, CLAUDE 
A. Biology: The Human Ap- 
proach. Philadelphia : W. B. Saunders Com- 
pany, 1950. 580 p. $5.00. 
This general biology text is an outgrowth of 
the author’s experience in teaching a course in 
Human Biology at the University of North Caro- 
lina. He 
is now at Harvard University. Emphasis 
has been placed on the comparative and evu- 
lutionary aspects of biology and on the physio- 
logical and chemical aspects of life. The author 
believes that the parts of biology most interesting 
to a beginning student and’most useful as a part 
of general education are those that explain how 
organisms, particularly human beings, function 
and how they came to stay that way. This text 
would serve excellently for use in college survey 
courses in biology and as a reference in high 
school biology courses.

Botatiy: An Ititroduction to Pfant Science. 
New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1950. 
480 p. $5.00. 
This text covers the basic facts of plant science 
and how they affect agriculture, medicine, and 
many other fields. Nearly 500 illustrations help 
to clarify important points of theory and structure. 
Each page is set in a double-column type of col- 
umn. Altogether this seems to be an unusually 
fine text i

Botany: An Evolutionary

Philadelphia :

This text features the classical approach to the 
subject. 
The author follows the sequence of 
evolution from the simplest to the complex, rather 
than beginning with familiar plants. There are 
261 illustrations and 118 plates. The author is 
Professor of 
Botany at McGill University, 
Montreal.

According to the author “This book is an out- 
growth of teaching experience, and one of its 
chief aims is to demonstrate that chemistry is not 
as difficult a science as many students are inclined 
to believe. To help accomplish this purpose a 
great deal of the material discussed has been 
illustrated with schematic drawings or photo-
