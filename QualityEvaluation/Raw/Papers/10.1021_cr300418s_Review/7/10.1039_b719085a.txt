Understanding the surface chemistry of TiO2 is key to the development and optimisation of many
technologies, such as solar power, catalysis, gas sensing, medical implantation, and corrosion
protection. In order to address this, considerable research eﬀort has been directed at model single
crystal surfaces of TiO2. Particular attention has been given to the rutile TiO2(110) surface
because it is the most stable face of TiO2. In this critical review, we discuss the chemical reactivity
of TiO2(110), focusing in detail on four molecules/classes of molecules. The selected molecules are
water, oxygen, carboxylic acids, and alcohols—all of which have importance not only to industry
but also in nature (173 references).

Introduction
Given the importance of TiO2 surface chemistry in a variety of
technologies,1–7 such as solar cells, catalysis, gas sensing,
medical implantation, and corrosion protection, it is hardly
surprising that there is a tremendous drive to probe and
enhance the chemical reactivity of this material. Currently,
research in this ﬁeld is wide-ranging, with activity extending
from synthesis of novel titania based structures (e.g. nano-
tubes8) to fundamental work aiming to comprehend surface
chemistry at the atomic scale (see, for example, ref. 9). This
latter eﬀort is typically concerned with studies of model low
Miller index single crystal surfaces under ultra-high vacuum
(UHV) conditions, in order to simplify the problem. Here, to
celebrate Gehard Ertl’s Nobel Chemistry Prize ‘‘for his studies
of chemical processes on solid surfaces’’,10 we review such
fundamental studies of chemical processes on TiO2, focusing
on the rutile TiO2(110) surface.
To date, rutile TiO2(110) is the most studied single crystal
TiO2 surface. Indeed, its 11 termination has emerged as the
prototypical metal oxide surface for fundamental studies. It
serves as a playground for researchers exploring a wide variety
of important topics, including surface chemistry at both
regular terrace sites and defects. A number of factors have
contributed to this surface’s pre-eminence for such work,
including the ready availability of high quality crystals, its
signiﬁcant electrical conductivity following annealing in va-
cuum, and the relative simplicity of the geometric structure of
the 11 phase.
In this critical review, we are not only concerned with the
chemistry of TiO2(110)11, but also that of the reconstructed
12 phase(s). We concentrate on the reactivity of these
surfaces with a number of technologically important mole-
cules, namely H2O, O2, R(COOH)n, and R(OH)n, updating
information provided in the seminal review of the surface
science of TiO2 by Diebold.11 Prior to discussing the reactivity
of TiO2(110) with the various molecules, we present pertinent
details of the structure of the clean 11 and 12 surfaces.

Clean surface
Key to the value of surface chemistry studies on model
substrates is a detailed knowledge of clean surface structure.
Without this information, mechanistic interpretation of reac-
tions can at best be speculative, at worst simply incorrect. For
TiO2(110), fortunately, many structural aspects are well char-
acterised, in particular for the 11 phase.

Fig. 1 displays a pseudo-space-ﬁlling model of the ideal
bulk-terminated TiO2(110)11 surface, consisting of so-called
bridging oxygens (Ob), 5-fold titaniums (Ti5c), and in-plane
oxygens at the solid–vacuum interface. The presence of this
structure, following typical UHV surface preparation compris-
ing inert gas ion bombardment and annealing cycles, has been
conﬁrmed experimentally using various quantitative probes of
surface crystallography.12–18 The most cited of these studies to
date is a surface X-ray diﬀraction (SXRD) study published by
Charlton et al. in 1997.12 Given that the displacements of the
11 topmost oxygen and titanium atoms (Ti(1)–Ti(4) and
O(1)–O(7) in Fig. 2) were determined with signiﬁcant preci-
sion, this structure has been considered a benchmark by many
researchers. However, there has been debate about the com-
plete accuracy of the optimised structure, with the bridging
oxygen atom (O(1) in Fig. 2) being of primary concern. This
situation has motivated a recent re-examination of the relaxa-
tion of the TiO2(110)11 surface, employing a number of
quantitative structural probes,15–18 including a more recent
SXRD study.18
Table 1 lists the atomic displacements corresponding to the
optimised structures emerging from the various recent experi-
mental studies,15–18 along with those from Charlton et al.’s
work.12 It is clear from this table that none of the latter work
replicates the relaxation of the bridging oxygen (O(1)) towards
the bulk determined in ref. 12, rather all ﬁnd that the oxygen

shifts away from the bulk. Furthermore, the displacements of
almost all other optimised atoms are quantitatively similar
across all of these recent measurements. Agreement is most
impressive for the quantitative low energy electron diﬀraction
(LEED-IV)15 and the latest SXRD18 experiments, as many of
the atomic displacements have been determined with high
precision (the error bars associated with the medium energy
ion scattering (MEIS) and photoelectron diﬀraction (PhD)
structures are typically somewhat larger).
Comparing experiment with ﬁrst-principles calculations of
the geometric structure of TiO2(110)11, these two strands of
eﬀort are apparently beginning to converge. In particular, no
recent theoretical studies predict that the bridging oxygen
(O(1)) relaxes signiﬁcantly towards the bulk; it either main-
tains its ideal bulk-terminated position,19,20 or shifts away
from the bulk.21–23 However, exact atomic coordinates are
dependent on the theoretical approach adopted, and further
work is required to establish a fully reliable, quantitative
theoretical
description
of
the
atomic
geometry
of
TiO2(110)11.
Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) images of TiO2(110)11
are also consistent with the structure displayed in Fig. 1 and 2
(see, for example, refs. 11, 24–28), although no further insight
into the coordinates of surface atoms is gained. The real value
of these probes is the visualisation of surface imperfections,
such as step edges, which are not normally accessible to
spatially integrating diﬀraction/scattering techniques. Of par-
ticular importance, as regards surface chemistry, are bridging
oxygen vacancies (Ob-vacs), which are the primary point
defects on this surface. Following standard substrate prepara-
tion in UHV, several percent of bridging oxygen atoms are
missing;28 the concentration of Ob-vacs can be controlled
through variation of the annealling temperature.29 Given
suﬃcient lateral resolution and appropriate tip condition,
these thermally induced vacancies can be imaged by both
scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STM), and non-contact
atomic force microscopy (NC-AFM). Almost all published
STM images show missing Ob as bright protrusions on dark
rows (see Fig. 3), the bright rows of the perfect terraces being
due to Ti5c rather than Ob.24,25 STM images can also be
obtained in which dark spots appear on bright rows but
because such images are not well understood they will not be
discussed further in this review.26 In both these cases and in all
other STM images presented in this review, positive tunnelling
is used so that electrons tunnel from ﬁlled tip states into empty
states of the sample. In NC-AFM, the Ob-vacs are usually
observed as dark depressions on bright rows, which in this case
are the Ob rows.27
Besides locally perturbing the geometry of TiO2(110)11,
Ob-vacs give rise to an occupied band gap state (BGS), which
from resonant photoemission is known to have primarily Ti 3d
character.30–32 This BGS can be directly observed spectro-
scopically,30–36 as demonstrated by Fig. 4, which displays
valence band photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) spectra from
(i) defect free TiO2(110)11, and (ii) TiO2(110)11 decorated
with Ob-vacs. It is also generally accepted that the presence of
this defect state is reﬂected in Ti 2p core level PES by the
appearance of a low binding energy shoulder, shifted by
B1.7 eV from the primary peak. Typically, these features
are nominally assigned to Ti3+ and Ti4+, respectively,
although it is clear from both experiment and theoretical
modelling that bonding in TiO2 has signiﬁcant covalent char-
acter.23,30,31
Very recently, the spatial distribution of the electronic
charge associated with the Ob-vac induced BGS has been
probed by scanned-angle mode PhD at the Ti 2p–Ti 3d
resonance.37 It is concluded that the charge is distributed
across several Ti atoms, both surface and subsurface, with
the majority being located on a second layer Ti (Ti(3) in
Fig. 2). Only a small amount of the charge is possessed by
surface layer titaniums (Ti(1) and Ti(2) in Fig. 2).
In addition to surface reduction, annealing a TiO2(110)
sample in UHV leads to substoichiometry in the bulk, which
is indicated by changes in sample colour.38 A pristine stoichio-
metric TiO2 single crystal sample is transparent, but with
increasing bulk reduction becomes green-blue, light/dark blue,
and ﬁnally dark blue-black. For considerably reduced (darker)

crystals, the (110) surface also reconstructs, usually to either a
simple 12 or a cross-linked 12 phase.39–54
Various
models for the
geometric
structure of simple
TiO2(110)12 have been reported in the literature. Initially, on
the basis of Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), a simple missing-
row model was suggested, formed by the loss of alternate rows of
bridging oxygen from the bulk terminated 11 surface.39 On the
basis of high resolution SPM images, this model has fallen out of
favour to be replaced by models involving added rows. Onishi
and Iwasawa have proposed that these added rows have Ti2O3
stoichiometry, although not the structure found in bulk Ti2O3
crystals.40,41 Pang et al. have hypothesised a contrasting model,
comprising Ti3O5 added rows, which is supported by theoretical
simulations of their STM images.42,43 Another model, developed
by Park et al., involves added Ti2O rows.44
Recently, Blanco-Rey et al. have removed the uncertainty
surrounding the identity of the simple 12 added rows,
through the employment of LEED-IV.45,46 They have demons-
trated that the added rows have the Ti2O3 architecture
suggested by Onishi and Iwasawa.40,41 Fig. 5 shows a ball
and stick model of the structure, and Table 2 lists atomic
coordinates of optimised atoms. This geometry is supported
by electron stimulated desorption ion angular distribution
(ESDIAD)
data,47
ion
scattering
measurements,48
and
ab initio calculations.49,50
Further STM studies, by Bennett et al., suggest that the
exact nature of the TiO2(110) reconstruction is dependent on
the extent of the bulk reduction of the TiO2 sample.51 They
have found that more stoichiometric samples (medium blue)
exhibit the simple 12 reconstruction, but that well-reduced
substrates (blue-black) display an x-linked 12 structure. In
addition to added rows, STM images (see Fig. 6) of this latter
phase show the presence of cross shaped structures connecting
neighbouring 12 rows, very roughly one every 12 unit cells in
the [001] direction. Bennett et al. also conclude that the
structure of the added rows is diﬀerent on simple 12 and
x-linked 12 surfaces. They assign the simple 12 added-rows
to Onishi and Iwasawa’s Ti2O3 model,40,41 whereas they
suggest that x-linked 12 added rows are consistent with a
slightly modiﬁed version of Pang et al.’s model,42,43 in which
an additional oxygen is incorporated into the added rows i.e.
Ti3O5 becomes Ti3O6. However, this assignment of the
x-linked added rows to Ti3O6 is disputed. For instance, it is
claimed in ref. 52 that they have the Onishi and Iwasawa Ti2O3
structure. Unpublished LEED-IV and SXRD data53 also
support a Ti2O3 stoichiometry for the x-linked added rows.

Water
TiO2 photocatalyses the splitting of water, and it is this
photoactivity which underpins the use of TiO2 in green
technology such as self-cleaning windows, air/water puriﬁca-
tion devices, and novel solar cells. Moreover, water is present
in virtually all conceivable technological applications of TiO2.
As such, the interaction of water with TiO2 surfaces is a crucial
area of research.

Here, we examine the dissociation of water in Ob-vacs, the
properties of water layers, and TiO2(110) under ambient water
pressures. Given that the enormous body of work discussing
water adsorption on TiO2(110) has been extensively reviewed
by Henderson in 200255 and summarised again in Diebold’s
review,11 we will introduce earlier work only brieﬂy and focus
on the signiﬁcant advances made in this area in the past few
years. As there are very few studies of water on the 12
terminations,56 only work on the 11 surface will be consid-
ered in this section.
Throughout this review, the coverage of molecules adsorbed
on TiO2(110) will be given in monolayers (ML), where 1 ML
corresponds to one adsorbate per primitive surface unit cell.
Gas and vapour exposures will be given in Langmuirs (L)
where 1 L = 1.33  106 mbar s.
3.1
Water dissociation
Nearly all experimental studies of water adsorption on
TiO2(110)11 indicate that water dissociates only at Ob-vacs,
as shown in the reaction scheme in Fig. 7. Water ﬁlls the
vacancy and one of the hydrogen atoms splits oﬀleaving a
bridging hydroxyl group (OHb) at the vacancy. The hydrogen
atom sits on a nearby bridging O atom, forming another OHb
species.
Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) spectra of water
on TiO2(110) give peaks at B163 K, B175 K, B265 K, and
B490 K, as shown in Fig. 8.57–60 For now, we will discuss only
the two higher temperature peaks.
When the surface was isotopically enriched with 18O before
exposure to H2
16O, H2
18O was preferentially desorbed at
B490 K.59 This not only shows that the B490 K peak must
arise from the recombination of dissociated water, it also
indicates that the hydrogen atoms of OHb can diﬀuse to other
Ob sites. As the coverage of water (B0.09 ML) desorbed in the
B490 K peak matches expectations of the Ob-vac concentra-
tion,57 it was concluded that water dissociates at the Ob-vacs.60
In contrast, only H2
16O desorbed at B265 K, suggestive of
molecular adsorption.
These peaks were further identiﬁed with molecular and
dissociative adsorption using static secondary ion mass spec-
trometry (SSIMS), as shown in Fig. 8. TiO(H2O)+ and
TiO(OH)+ peaks were monitored as a function of anneal
temperature following exposure to water. The TiO(H2O)+
signal falls to zero at B265 K whereas the TiO(OH)+ signal
attentuates at B490 K.60
As discussed in section 2, spectroscopic probes detect a BGS
B0.8–0.9 eV below EF which is associated with Ob-vacs.30–32
Resonant PES spectra show that water exposure even up to
100 L (at B300 K) does not attenuate the defect state,
indicating that electronically the Ob-vacs are not healed by
water,33 a conclusion also formed on the basis of electron
energy loss (EELS) data.34 In line with these observations,
theoretical calculations have recently detected the presence of
BGS for both Ob-vacs and OHb.61
Brookes et al.62 used STM at a range of temperatures in
order to observe this water dissociation, as shown in Fig. 9.
The key result was a switch from bright spots being adsorbed
on the bright rows at r200 K to bright spots appearing

the concentration of the bright spots at B290 K is about
B0.08 ML, Brookes et al.62 infer that they represent OHb
formed from water dissociated in Ob-vacs.
By imaging the reaction dynamically, STM has the power to
directly follow the dissociation of water in Ob-vacs. However,
an obvious prerequisite is that Ob-vacs must be unambigu-
ously identiﬁed in STM images. As discussed in section 2,
STM images of TiO2(110) are generally thought to show
Ob-vacs as bright spots on dark Ob rows.24 However, based
on STM imaging and electron stimulated desorption (ESD)
experiments, Suzuki et al.63 suggested that these bright spots
(also known as type-A defects) originate from OHb; the source
of hydrogen being residual water vapour or H2 in the vacuum
chamber. Schaub et al.64 partially resolved this issue by
showing the presence of two kinds of type-A defects (see
Fig. 10). The brighter (Ab) defects were assigned to Ob-vacs
and the darker (Ad) defects to OHb.
The evidence for this assignment was two-fold. First, their
DFT simulations of STM images suggest that Ob-vacs should
be brighter than OHb. Second, the concentration of type-A
defects after exposing TiO2(110) to water was counted to be
about twice the number of Ab defects before exposure, con-
sistent with water dissociation in Ob-vacs forming two OHb
species.
Evidence accumulated over the past few years, how-
ever,28,65–69 reverses the assignment of type-A defects by
Schaub et al.64 One of the keys to distinguishing OHb from
Ob-vacs was suggested by studies in which the STM tip was
scanned over the TiO2(110) surface at a raised voltage of
+3 V. Type-A defects were removed from the surface and
interpreted as tip-induced reﬁlling of Ob-vacs by Diebold et
al.70 and as tip-induced removal of hydrogen from OHb by
Suzuki et al.63
Bikondoa et al.28,65 removed individual type-A defects with
electrical pulses at ca. +3 V, as shown in Fig. 10. Crucially,
only Ab defects could be removed in this way and this was used
as a means to distinguish the two types of defects. Ab defects
were removed by scanning at a raised bias of +3 V, creating
an Ab defect-free region (the ‘clean-oﬀarea’) before exposing
to water, as shown in Fig. 11. If the Ab defects are Ob-vacs as
suggested by Schaub et al.,64 then exposure to water should
have little eﬀect in the clean-oﬀarea as there would be no
Ob-vacs to react with. On the other hand, if the Ad defects are
Ob-vacs, then exposure of the surface to water should replen-
ish the Ab defects in the clean-oﬀarea, due to water molecules
dissociating in the Ob-vacs.
It turned out that exposure of the surface to water led to the
replenishment of Ab defects in the clean-oﬀarea (Fig. 11c), so
that Ab defects were assigned to OHb and Ad defects to
Ob-vacs. This also means that the ca. +3 V scans and tip pulses
desorbed hydrogen from the OHb groups. Whilst the mechan-
ism for this hydrogen desorption is as yet unknown, it may be
related to an empty state identiﬁed by Onda et al.71 using two-
photon photoemission (2PP) spectroscopy and assigned as a
‘wet electron state’; a wet electron state being a partially
hydrated state. This state was found B2.4 eV above EF,
maximising when OHb coexists with 1 ML of molecular water.
Returning to Fig. 11c: because STM images were recorded
from the same area before and after exposure to water, it can
be seen that some of the new OHb reside in positions pre-
viously taken by Ob-vacs. Thus Bikondoa et al.28,65 imaged
water dissociating in the Ob-vacs forming one OHb in place of
the Ob-vacs and another OHb group elsewhere, in line with the
mechanism depicted in Fig. 7. Low temperature STM experi-
ments indicate that water dissociation occurs as low as
B187 K,68 which matches conclusions from high resolution
EELS (HREELS).34
One curiosity is that the number of OHb in positions
previously taken by Ob-vacs is always slightly higher than
the number found elsewhere. According to the mechanism in
Fig. 7, an equal number of OHb should be found at the
Ob-vacs and away from them. Wendt et al.67,68 propose that
immediately after water molecules dissociate, the two resulting
OHb sit next to each other in the [001] direction. In such a
conﬁguration, individual OHb from the pair are diﬃcult to
resolve in STM images and each OHb pair therefore appears as

a single feature, explaining the apparent anomaly. In some
images, type-A defects with three apparent sizes can be seen,
the largest assigned to OHb pairs, the next largest to isolated
OHb, and the smallest to Ob-vacs.65–69 These general trends
have been reproduced in the latest STM simulations of
Ob-vacs and OHb.66,72
The unambiguous assignment of OHb and Ob-vacs in STM
images enabled point defects in NC-AFM images of TiO2(110)
to be identiﬁed deﬁnitively as well. Fig. 12 shows an STM
image alongside a simultaneously recorded NC-AFM image.
The STM image was recorded simply by applying a bias
between the NC-AFM tip and sample, during otherwise
standard NC-AFM operation, and recording the tunnelling
current. By correlating the positions of the dark spots in the
NC-AFM image with OHb and Ob-vacs in the STM image,
Pang et al.73 show that the dark spots correspond to both OHb
and Ob-vacs. It then follows that the bright rows in the
NC-AFM image must correspond to Ob rows. The assignment
of both OHb and Ob-vacs (which are in reality protrusions and
depressions, respectively) to depressions in the NC-AFM
image is signiﬁcant because it means the intuitive idea that
NC-AFM faithfully traces the true surface topography must
be rejected.
In further support of this, NC-AFM images recorded by
both Pang et al.74 and Lauritsen et al.75 show that adventitious
tip changes can give images with diﬀering contrasts. As shown
in Fig. 13, Pang et al.74 recorded a pair of NC-AFM images
between which such a tip change occurs. In the ﬁrst image,
type-A defects appear as depressions in the bright Ob rows like
in Fig. 12b, whereas in the second image, the type-A defects
appear as bright features between bright rows; the latter must
therefore be assigned to Ti5c rows. One way in which a tip may
change is in the polarity of the apex and the observed contrast

employed ﬁrst a tip apex with a positive potential then a
negative one.75
3.2
Diﬀusion of water dissociation products
Wendt et al.68 and Zhang et al.69 tracked the diﬀusion of the
OHb following water dissociation. STM movies at B187 K
showed that the OHb pairs separate along the [1
10] direction
via proton exchange with water molecules.68 Snapshots of the
movie are displayed in Fig. 14. These movies were supported
by calculations of the potential energy proﬁle, which show that
the barrier to diﬀusion is lowered by this exchange with water.
Sequential NC-AFM images also capture the splitting of the
OHb pairs at room temperature.76 The same diﬀusion mechan-
ism occurs for isolated OHb and it should be noted that
because of the erroneous assignment of OHb and Ob-vacs by
Schaub et al.,64 this water-mediated diﬀusion of OHb was
mistakenly
reported
as
oxygen-mediated
diﬀusion
of
Ob-vacs,77,78 via a mechanism inconsistent with subsequent
isotope studies.79
In addition to this water-assisted diﬀusion, Zhang et al.69
observed OHb pairs separating along the [001] direction, as
shown in Fig. 15. By carefully analysing the positions of the
OHb, it was shown that the ﬁrst hop is usually taken by the
OHb which does not ﬁll the Ob-vac. Therefore, contrary to
previous expectations, the two OHb resulting from dissocia-
tion of a water molecule appear to be inequivalent. Zhang
et al. speculate that this is due to a diﬀerent charge distribution
around each OHb; the Ob-vac has two nominally Ti3+ ions
beneath it so that when water dissociates, the OHb which sits
in the vacancy is connected to two Ti3+ ions whereas the
adjacent OHb is bound to only one Ti3+ ion, the other Ti ion
being Ti4+. It is important to note this description of the
charge distribution serves only as an indication that the charge
around each OHb is likely to be diﬀerent as it is clear from
scanned angle PhD that the charge distribution around
Ob-vacs is rather complicated (see section 2),37 and one would
expect a similar situation for OHb.
3.3
Water layers
Returning to the water TPD in Fig. 8, measurements by
Hugenschmidt et al.57 show that the work function decreases
with the coverage of the B265 K peak. This can be explained
by the dipole created if water is molecularly adsorbed with its
O atom (Owater) pointing down (negative) and the hydrogen up
(positive). In such a conﬁguration, one would expect water to
sit on the Ti5c sites. This expectation was conﬁrmed in subse-
quently obtained low temperature STM images.62,64,67,68 Very
recently, this bonding conﬁguration was quantitatively exam-
ined with scanned energy mode PhD.80,81A Ti5c–Owater bond
length of 2.21 A
˚ was found, indicating a more weakly bound
chemisorbed species in comparison to other adsorbates on
TiO2(110), such as formate (2.08 A
˚ ). Given that most theore-
tical calculations overestimate the Ti5c–Owater bond length
(e.g. refs. 66, 82 and 83), it was suggested that a more accurate
theoretical description of this bond could be used as a bench-
mark in future theoretical modelling.
After the Ti5c sites are ﬁlled, a second layer of water can
adsorb over the Ob sites corresponding to water in the B175 K
TPD state. Exposures beyond the second layer leads to for-
mation of multilayer water which desorbs at B163 K in TPD
with the zero order desorption kinetics expected.

The work function measurements by Hugenschmidt et al.57
show that water exposure beyond the ﬁrst monolayer does not
lead to any further work function changes. This was taken as
evidence that the second layer water adsorbs parallel to the
surface, presumably to allow hydrogen bonding to the ﬁrst
layer water. An O–H stretch appeared in HREEL spectra
below B3300 cm1 when the second layer of water was
adsorbed. As stretching frequencies below B3400 cm1 are
typical
of
hydrogen
bonded
OH,84
the
feature
below
B3300 cm1 suggests that the second layer water is hydrogen
bonded. However, as the loss feature assigned to the mono-
layer remained at B3505 cm1, neither shifting nor attenuat-
ing, Henderson58 concluded that the hydrogen bonding does
not involve the O–H bonds of monolayer water.
New evidence has recently been given for hydrogen bonding
between monolayer and second layer water molecules by an
ESD study. Crucially, Petrik and Kimmel were able to form
isotopically distinct bilayers of water.85 A monolayer of water
was prepared by dosing one water isotope at 195 K. The
second layer could then be prepared by dosing another water
isotope below 70 K. By monitoring water evolution during
ESD at temperatures above 70 K, Petrik and Kimmel gave
evidence for H–D exchange above 70 K and interlayer mixing
of molecules above 90 K. Thus, it was concluded that the
second water layer hydrogen bonds to the monolayer. When
thicker water ﬁlms (B3 ML) were electron bombarded at
B100 K,86 H and H2 were detected, indicating that the
bombardment causes water to dissociate.
3.4
Water at ambient pressures
Ketteler et al.87,88 used a specially designed ambient pressure
PES system to investigate water adsorption on TiO2(110)
under pressures of up to B2 mbar. This was performed by
tracking the respective core level PES signals from oxygen
originating from molecular water and OHb. At the beginning
of the measurements, the OHb coverage was twice the initial
Ob-vac coverage, indicating that water had dissociated in the
Ob-vacs, as expected on the basis of UHV experiments (see
section 3.1 and refs. 28, 65–69). As the water coverage was
increased, either by decreasing the temperature at a ﬁxed
pressure (isobars) or by increasing the pressure at a ﬁxed
temperature (isotherms), the OHb concentration remains the
same, showing that no further water dissociation occurred
beyond that already attributed to Ob-vac dissociation.
The isotherms and isobars can be converted into a relative
humidity measurement (RH) which is deﬁned as p/pv(T) 
100, where p is the pressure and pv is the equilibrium vapour
pressure of bulk water or ice at the corresponding temperature
(T). When the isobars and isotherms are plotted together, they
follow the same curve. This indicates that the vapour and
surface are in thermodynamic equilibrium. Fig. 16 shows
coverage versus RH curves for three isobars. The water cover-
age increases steadily with RH then plateaus as the OHb
coverage is approached, after which the water coverage in-
creases again with inﬂections at B2 ML and B3 ML.
From these results, Ketteler et al. suggest that OHb act as
Brønsted acid sites, binding water into OHb–H2O complexes.
These
complexes

nucleate

water
adsorption. As more water attaches to these nucleation cen-
tres, the adsorption complex becomes less acidic and the water
binding structure tends to that of the bulk liquid. This is
achieved after adsorbing B2 ML of water.
4.
Oxygen
O2 like water is often present in environments where TiO2
might be used in technological applications. Added to this, the
interaction of O2 and TiO2 is of direct importance in devices
such as solar cells, gas sensors, and catalytic converters. In this
section, we focus ﬁrst on O2 adsorption chemistry. In parti-
cular, we consider examples of dissociative and molecular
adsorption as well as co-adsorption with water, before dis-
cussing the reoxidation of the surface at high temperature.
4.1
O2 dissociation
Numerous studies show that when TiO2(110) is exposed to O2,
the Ob-vacs are healed. Kurtz et al.33 used resonant PES to
show that when O2 is dosed at 400 K the BGS associated with
Ob-vacs is essentially quenched with O2 exposure. Similar
results were obtained by Pan et al.89 and Wang et al.35, the
latter employing defective surfaces prepared by electron bom-
bardment.
Onda et al.36 used 2PP spectroscopy to compare O2 adsorp-
tion on defective surfaces created by electron bombardment
and vacuum annealing. Their results suggest that defects
created by electron bombardment perturb the work function
less than those created by vacuum annealing. Furthermore,
Onda et al. found that the BGS introduced by electron
bombardment was quenched by only 0.3 L O2 at 100 K. In
contrast, for a defective surface created by UHV annealing,
Perkins and Henderson90 reported that the BGS detected by
EELS was only removed after annealing the surface to 200 K,

following exposure to O2 at 110 K. Onda et al.36 conclude that
electron bombardment can lead to pure Ob-vac creation
whereas vacuum annealing probably generates a variety of
defects, only some of which are Ob-vacs.
Pan et al.89 prepared an oxidised surface by annealing and
cooling TiO2(110) in 2.7  106 mbar O2. Low energy ion
scattering (LEIS) from this surface showed no 18O uptake even
after exposure to 500 L 18O2 at room temperature. On the
other hand, when an equivalent experiment was performed on
a UHV annealed surface, the 18O uptake had a saturation
value of B0.08 ML, consistent with estimates of the Ob-vac
density.33
Whilst these results indicate that exposure to O2 heals the
Ob-vacs even at low temperatures (at least based on the
electronic structure), the healing mechanism is yet to be
addressed. Epling et al.91 posited four feasible scenarios
whereby Ob-vac may be healed by O2: (1) two Ob-vacs are
ﬁlled by one O2 molecule, (2) one Ob-vac is ﬁlled by an O atom
from one O2 molecule with the other O atom being released
into the gas phase, (3) one Ob-vac is ﬁlled by an O atom from
one O2 molecule with the other O atom being incorporated
into the bulk, and ﬁnally (4) one Ob-vac is ﬁlled by an O atom
from one O2 molecule with the other O atom being adsorbed
at the surface, most likely at a Ti5c site.
Epling et al.91 show that adsorbed oxygen in some form is
left on the surface after the Ob-vacs are ﬁlled. The evidence
comes from the perturbation of the TPD spectra of water and
ammonia when the surface is pre-dosed with O2. For a
TiO2(110) surface pre-dosed with O2 at 300 K, then exposed
to water at 90 K, a new water TPD peak is found at B290 K.
Scenarios (1)–(3) above should not have any eﬀect on the
reactivity of the TiO2(110) surface, so it was concluded that
one Ob-vac is healed per O2 molecule with the other O atom
being adsorbed at a Ti5c site (Oad), a dissociation mechanism
supported by theoretical calculations.92,93
The B290 K peak can be explained as follows: water reacts
with the Oad to form two OH groups bound to the Ti5c sites
(OHt groups). As the temperature is ramped towards 300 K,
water is desorbed, leaving an Oad at the surface again. To test
that Oad is still present following desorption of water in the
B290 K peak, Epling et al.91 ﬁrst dosed O2 then water at 90 K.
A water TPD spectrum was then taken to 550 K with the new
peak at B290 K again appearing. Cooling the sample to 90 K
and re-dosing water without further O2 exposure led to an
almost identical spectrum. Isotopic studies show that the water
which desorbs at B290 K scrambles oxygen from Oad and
oxygen from the dosed water, consistent with the proposed
mechanism.
An indication of the temperature range at which Oad is
formed by O2 dissociation can be obtained by varying the O2
exposure temperature and measuring the area under the
B290 K peak in otherwise identical TPD spectra. The peak
area decreased slightly between 300–375 K and signiﬁcantly
between 530–650 K. The sharp decrease above 530 K can be
attributed to competition between dissociation of O2 to form
Oad and the reoxidation of the surface where oxygen is
incorporated into the growing TiO2(110) crystal, a process
which will be discussed further in section 4.4. Although there
was no change in the B290 K peak area for O2 exposed at
90 K and 300 K, this does not necessarily mean O2 dissociates
at the lower temperature because O2 molecules could adsorb
molecularly at the lower temperature, then dissociate as the
temperature is ramped towards B290 K.
Bikondoa et al.28,65 imaged the dissociation of O2 directly
using STM. They ensured that any O2 reaction with Ob-vacs
was not convoluted with O2/OHb reactions by removing OHb
from an area of the surface by scanning at +3 V. The same
area was then imaged before and after exposure to B0.6 L O2
at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 17. Following O2
exposure, the four Ob-vacs indicated in Fig. 17a are replaced
with four bright features on nearby bright rows. This indicates
that O2 has dissociated in the Ob-vacs, with one O atom ﬁlling
the vacancy and the other forming Oad on a nearby Ti5c site.
Wendt et al.67 obtained similar results with O2 dosed at 120 K,
showing that O2 dissociates in Ob-vacs at least down to 120 K.
Spatial analysis of the Oad positions following dissociation
at room temperature reveal B74% of them lie one lattice
constant (in the [001] direction) away from the Ob-vac ﬁlled,
the other B26% being found immediately adjacent and two

lattice constants away.94 As thermal diﬀusion of Oad on
TiO2(110) is very slow, the separation of Oad from the posi-
tions adjacent to the reacting Ob-vacs was attributed to energy
released during the exothermic dissociation of the O2 molecule
(calculated at B3.5 eV67) in a similar way to that observed for
Cl2 dissociation.95
4.2
Molecular adsorption of O2
A surprising temperature dependence was observed for
TiO2(110) surfaces exposed to O2. At 120 K, Henderson
et al.96 reported that up to three O2 molecules were adsorbed
per Ob-vac. As these surfaces are heated, one O2 per Ob-vac
dissociates. The other O2 molecules desorb molecularly at
B410 K. As the adsorption temperature is increased, the
amount of O2 desorbed in the B410 K state is reduced until
the state disappears at an adsorption temperature of 180 K. It
was therefore concluded that at Z 180 K, no molecular O2
adsorbs. After TPD to 435 K, re-exposing the surface to O2 at
120 K does not revive the B410 K O2 peak in TPD. Hender-
son et al.96 conclude that whilst the additional molecularly
adsorbed O2 may not adsorb directly in the Ob-vac, they
adsorb in sites somehow associated with them, such as in
adjacent sites.
Alongside this rich thermal chemistry, a series of photoreac-
tion
and
photodesorption
experiments
have
been
per-
formed.90,97–101
Lu
et
al.97
found
two
molecular
chemisorption states for O2 which were denoted as a and b
states. Upon UV irradiation, the a state photo-oxidises CO
whereas the b state undergoes fast photodesorption. When O2
is adsorbed at a temperature of B105 K, the a state dominates.
Annealing above B200 K converts the a state to the b state.
Above B300 K, the a state is no longer present and the b state
disappears above B400 K. As with the thermal experiments,
these molecular O2 states were linked to Ob-vacs. This was
based on their maximum saturation density (0.12 ML) which
compared well with typical estimates of the Ob-vac density.89
Further experiments led to the a state being resolved into
two states (a1 and a2) with diﬀerent photodesorption cross-
sections.98 However, very recently, Thompson and Yates have
proposed that rather than the existence of multiple O2 species,
the desorption rate of O2 follows a fractal rate law,102 whereby
the rate ‘constant’ varies with the time of the reaction and is
therefore more correctly described as a rate coeﬃcient.99,101
By irradiating a TiO2(110) surface exposed to O2 at B115 K
with UV light prior to performing TPD measurements,
Perkins and Henderson showed that the B410 K O2 TPD
peak depletes.90 Because the a2 state was reported to dominate
at such a low temperature and because the cross-section for
depletion of the B410 K TPD peak is close to that reported
for photodesorption of the a2 state, Perkins and Henderson
assigned the B410 K state to a2 O2. However, Thompson and
Yates disagree with this assignment, based on the observation
that the a states already convert to the b states at 300 K, which
themselves dissociate by B400 K.100 Hence, the connection
between these thermally and optically activated O2 molecules
is still open to debate. Nevertheless, both sets of experiments
point to molecular adsorption of O2 at low temperatures
provided that Ob-vacs are present. However, in contrast to
this, Wendt et al. suggest that some minority sites apart from
Ob-vacs must be responsible for the molecular adsorption of
O2 because they ﬁnd that even at 120 K, O2 dissociates to form
Oad.67
4.3
O2 and water reactions
In section 4.1, we described how water reacts with a TiO2(110)
surface pre-exposed to O2. Here, the order of adsorption is
reversed and the eﬀect of dosing O2 on a surface pre-exposed
to water is examined.34 Water TPD spectra recorded from a
hydroxylated TiO2(110) surface exposed to O2 gives rise to a
new peak at B300–320 K which intensiﬁes at the expense of
the B520 K peak when the O2 exposure is increased. The
B520 K peak corresponds to the OHb recombinative peak at
B490 K in section 3.1, the recorded temperatures of the TPD
peaks being systematically oﬀset from the earlier work. Simi-
larly, the B300–320 K peak corresponds to the B290 K OHt
recombinative peak found when a TiO2(110) surface with Oad
is exposed to water (section 4.1).
By isotopically labelling the O2, it was shown that the water
which desorbs at B300–320 K always comes from the dosed
O2 and not from lattice O. This means that O2 must abstract
hydrogen from OHb presumably to form OHt. H2O2 and/or
O2H were speculatively suggested as intermediate species
before conversion to OHt, with subsequent calculations show-
ing that H2O2 is particularly stable.103
4.4
Reoxidation of non-stoichiometric TiO2(110)
As far back at the 1960s, it has been known that TiO2 surfaces
are reduced during ion sputtering and that the stoichiometry is
restored during annealing, even in UHV. There had been an
assumption in the literature that this stoichiometry is restored
by diﬀusion of oxygen from the bulk to the surface. However,
in the past decade or so, there has been a growing body of
work which supports the idea that stoichiometry is also
restored by the diﬀusion of reduced Tin+ interstitial ions back
into the bulk.104,105 By annealing TiO2(110) samples in pres-
sures of O2, the reoxidation of these interstitial ions has been
stunningly captured in a series of high temperature STM and
low energy electron microscopy (LEEM) experiments.
Onishi and Iwasawa were the ﬁrst to image this reoxidation
process directly. They recorded STM images of the TiO2(110)
surface reacting with O2 (1107 mbar) over a period of about
40 min. 12 rows were observed growing out from 11
terraces, leading to the conclusion that interstitial Tin+ ions
react with O2 at the surface to form added Ti2O3 rows.41
This reoxidation process has been studied in more detail
with a series of high resolution STM movies by Bowker
et al.51,106–108 and Bennett.109 The movies can be viewed via
refs. 106 and 109. Both the simple 12 and x-linked 12 rows
were observed to reoxidise, although the x-linked 12 was
found to be more reactive to oxygen.51
Fig. 18 shows a sequence of STM images recorded at 673 K
and B4  107 mbar O2, starting with an image of x-linked
12. As the reaction progresses, the density of x-links in-
creases until they ﬁll in the gaps between the 12 rows and
small 11 patches are formed (Fig. 18c). Continued reaction
with O2 leads to the coalescence of the 11 patches until

almost none of the original 12 terrace remains (Fig. 18e),
whereupon 12 rows grow on top of the 11 surface and the
12 - 11 - 12 cycle continues.
The same cyclic growth can be seen on a much larger scale in
the series of LEEM images shown in Fig. 19, which were
recorded at 820 K and 1.3  106 mbar O2.110 The images in
Fig. 19 are set so that the dark areas correspond to the 12
phase and the bright areas the 11 phase. At the start of the
experiment, the surface has a 11 termination (Fig. 19a). The
surface has switched to a 12 phase in Fig. 19b. In Fig. 19c,
11 areas have nucleated on the 12 surface, almost ﬁlling the
surface in Fig. 19d, whereupon the 11 - 12 - 11 -
12 cycle continues.
While both the STM and LEEM sequences show the basic
reoxidation reaction, exploration of the parameter space
reveals subtle diﬀerences in the reaction depending on the
temperature and pressure. Most notably, both the STM and
LEEM experiments reveal a competition between growth out
of the surface (layer-by-layer) and growth of the surface
laterally (step-ﬂow) with step-ﬂow dominating at higher tem-
peratures. Step-ﬂow is shown clearly in Fig. 20. At intermedi-
ate temperatures, a mixed growth mode occurs whereby the
larger terraces grow in the layer-by-layer fashion and the
smaller terraces grow by step-ﬂow until they reach a critical
size. At the critical size, layer-by-layer growth begins.110 At
low temperatures (o573 K at 1  107 mbar O2 in ref. 106)
and high temperatures (41023 K in 1.3  106 mbar O2 in
ref. 110) little or no reactivity was observed. For low tempera-
tures, this is presumably because the thermal energy supplied

is insuﬃcient to overcome the barriers to reaction, whereas at
high temperatures the surface growth is limited by the low
residency time of the O2 molecules at the surface. With the
data available, it is not yet possible to form a useful ‘phase
diagram’ for the growth modes. Whilst McCarty varied the O2
pressure around 1.3  106 mbar to establish qualitatively that
the transition temperature between layer-by-layer/mixed/pure
step-ﬂow increases with O2 pressure, this has not been re-
corded quantitatively. More diﬃcult will be accounting for the
Ti interstitial concentration between diﬀerent crystals. So far,
this has largely been done simply by noting the colour of the
crystal. One way in which the Ti interstitial density could be
quantiﬁed is by measuring the resistivity of the crystal.38
Li et al.38,111–113 performed a series of studies somewhat
diﬀerent to the previous ones in that the samples are reoxidised
in O2 (B1  106 mbar), then imaged at room temperature
without O2 present. A new surface morphology was found
consisting of a pseudo-hexagonal network. The structure was
assigned to an incomplete 11 layer which forms on top of the
‘normal’ 11 termination. It was termed a ‘rosette’ network
and forms at B470–660 K. The rosettes are reminiscent of the
12 x-links and it is likely that at least parts of a spongy surface
formed by Stone et al.106 at B573 K have the same structure.
Importantly, Li et al.112 have also reoxidised their crystals
with 18O2 and detected 18O incorporation at the surfaces,
ﬁnding a maximum rate for 18O incorporation at B669 K.
Li et al. also found 18O uptake to be faster for more reduced
crystals (as judged qualitatively from their colour).112 This
indicates that the growth rate is dependent on the concentra-
tion of Tin+ interstitials. A similar reaction dependence was
also observed by McCarty,110 and was one of the reasons
suggested for the diﬀerent activation energies for reoxidation
calculated by Smith et al.108 (B25 kJ mol1) from extended
sequences of STM images and by Li et al.112 (B80 kJ mol1)
from 18O uptake measurements.

Carboxylic acids
Given the importance of carboxyl containing molecules in a
variety of TiO2-based applications (e.g. Gra
¨ tzel-type solar
cells), it is hardly surprising that there is a large archive of
fundamental studies on the interaction of carboxylic acids with
TiO2(110). Eﬀort has largely focused on adsorption on the
11 phase, although there are also studies of the chemistry on
the 12 reconstruction.
In this section, the chemistry of the simplest carboxylic acid,
namely formic acid, is ﬁrst discussed, covering both initial
adsorption and subsequent decomposition. Then we move
onto other carboxylic acids, discussing their adsorption, ther-
mal decomposition, and ﬁnally photodecomposition.
5.1
Formic acid
5.1.1
Adsorption. It is well established114–117 that formic
acid adsorbs dissociatively (acidic hydrogen cleavage) on
TiO2(110)11 at room temperature, i.e.
HCOOH(g) - [HCOO]
(ads) + H+
(ads)
(1)
These chemisorbed formate species ([HCOO]
(ads)) saturate at
approximately 0.5 ML (where 1 ML corresponds to one
formate per surface 5-fold Ti), forming an ordered (21)
overlayer.114 At lower formate coverage, a local c(42) order
has been observed with STM.118
To gain further insight into the acid dissociation reaction,
several groups have probed the geometry of the surface
formate moiety.116,117,119–122 Of these investigations the most
detailed is a chemical-state speciﬁc scanned-energy mode PhD
study by Sayago et al.,122 which quantitatively determines
both bonding site and adsorbate orientation. It is concluded
that formate binds to the surface through both of its oxygens
to two adjacent ﬁve-fold surface titanium (Ti5c) atoms, so that
its molecular plane is aligned with the [001] azimuth, i.e. it lies
parallel to the rows of bridging oxygens (Ob). A schematic
diagram of this local adsorption geometry is shown in Fig. 21,
including values for pertinent structural parameters. Interest-
ingly, the location of the proton (H+
(ads)) resulting from
HCOOH dissociation was also determined in this study. It
was found to be attached to a bridging oxygen, forming a
bridging hydroxyl (OHb).
Other experiments,116,117,119–121 as well as theoretical calcu-
lations,123–127 support the formate adsorption geometry de-
termined by Sayago et al. (Type A in Fig. 22). In addition,
some measurements suggest the presence of a second formate
species on TiO2(110)11.116,117,121,128 From reﬂection absorp-
tion infra-red spectroscopy (RAIRS)116 and near edge X-ray
absorption ﬁne structure (NEXAFS),121 it was concluded that
this second formate comprises B30–40% of a saturated (21)
overlayer, and is oriented with its molecular plane aligned
along the [1
10] direction, i.e. it is azimuthally rotated by 901
with respect to Sayago et al.’s formate conﬁguration. It was
suggested in ref. 116 that this species is Type B in Fig. 22,
which arises through reaction of formic acid with Ob-vacs,
generated during the formation of Type A formate. This Type
B conﬁguration, which is coordinated via one O to the Ob-vac
and through its other O atom to an adjacent Ti5c site, was
ﬁrst proposed by Wang et al. on the basis of ab initio
calculations.123
Sayago et al. found no evidence for the second formate
species, although they did consider such a possibility during
their structure determination.122 Long-range order is not a
prerequisite for application of PhD, and so a minority formate
species, if present in suﬃcient concentration, would emerge

from the data analysis. Consequently, there appears to be a
signiﬁcant disparity between the PhD, and the RAIRS and
NEXAFS studies.116,121 However, as indicated in ref. 122, it
may merely be that the population of Type B formate is
minimal in the PhD study due to diﬀerences in experimental
conditions, e.g. sample preparation/history, amount of formic
acid dosed, and the precise substrate temperature during
exposure. Recent work by Aizawa et al.129 supports this
hypothesis. They acquired STM images from a TiO2(110)11
surface exposed to formic acid and then annealed to 350 K for
400 min. Careful analysis of the data indicated three diﬀerent
formate surface geometries, Type A, Type B, and Type C in
Fig. 22, which were present on the surface in a ratio of 10 : 7 : 3.
Type C formate is surface bonded through only one O atom,
which ﬁlls an Ob-vac. Given these results, it is plausible that
the second formate species observed in RAIRS and NEXAFS
is a result of formic acid exposure being conducted with the
substrate somewhat above room temperature. We note that
STM images recorded by Bowker et al.128 following formic
acid dosing at room temperature are also suggestive of a
second formate species, but at a concentration of only B1%
of the ordered (21)-[HCOO] overlayer.
In contrast to this extensive eﬀort on the 11 phase, there
has been very limited activity focusing on the adsorption of
formic acid on reconstructed TiO2(110). Bennett et al.130 have
employed STM to examine formic acid adsorption at room
temperature on the x-linked 12 phase. They found that
formic acid binds, presumably as formate, preferentially to
the x-links, although it does also adsorb in between the x-links,
forming a rather disordered overlayer. In another STM
study25 on a TiO2(110) surface exhibiting strands of the simple
12 phase, it was concluded that formic acid does not adsorb
on these features. Bennett et al. used this result as evidence
that the simple and x-linked 12 phases have diﬀerent struc-
tures. However, given that more recent work suggests that
these two phases both consist of Ti2O3 added rows (see section
2), it is more likely that this diﬀerence in surface reactivity is
due to variation in experimental procedure. For example,
Bennett et al.130 exposed the surface to B240–500 L of formic
acid, whereas an exposure of 3 L was employed in ref. 25.
5.1.2
Thermal decomposition. Aizawa et al.’s STM study129
was motivated by interest in understanding the thermal de-
composition of formic acid on TiO2(110)11 beyond surface
formate formation. This topic has been a focus of attention for
a number of years, and quite detailed insight has been gained
through a combination of experiment and theory. The former
eﬀort can be separated into two categories, namely measure-
ments performed with the TiO2(110) sample at ﬁxed tempera-
ture in a ﬂux of formic acid (i.e. steady-state conditions) and
studies of adsorbed formic acid/formate overlayers as a func-
tion of substrate temperature.
Under steady-state conditions, Onishi et al.114,131 conclude
that there are two decomposition channels for formic acid on
TiO2(110)11, i.e.
HCOOH(g) - CO(g) + H2O(g) (dehydration)
(2)
and
HCOOH(g) - CO2(g) + H2(g) (dehydrogenation)
(3)
They have found that the dehydration reaction is dominant at
substrate temperatures 4500 K, whereas at lower tempera-
tures dehydration prevails. A similar result emerged from a
comparable study by Wang et al.132 In sharp contrast, Bowker
et al.128 found no evidence for the dehydrogenation reaction
in their steady-state measurements, observing only dehydra-
tion. There is no obvious explanation for this discrepancy,
although it has been suggested it might be due to diﬀerences
in
either
formic
acid
partial
pressure
or
surface
structure.128,132 We note that Bowker et al.128 did observe
formic acid dehydrogenation on a surface decorated with Pd
nanoparticles.
As regards the evolution of formic acid/formate overlayers
with temperature, it has been found that by approximately
350 K any long-range (21) order is lost.114 This disordering
arises due to the formation of multiple formate bonding
geometries,129 as discussed above, along with desorption of a
proportion of the bound formate, which TPD shows comes oﬀ
as formic acid,114,115,132 i.e.
[HCOO]
(ads) + H+
(ads)
- HCOOH(g) (recombination)
(4)
Besides evidencing this recombination reaction, desorbed spe-
cies observed in the TPD measurements also reveal surface
formate decomposition processes; a list of the desorbed species
and their desorption temperatures (TDs) found in the three
TPD studies conducted to date114,115,132 is provided in Table 3.
In all of these studies, CO and H2O are both major products,
suggesting that formic acid dehydration (reaction (2)) readily
occurs under these conditions. Most simply, this reaction
could
proceed
through
fragmentation
of
the
adsorbed
formate,
[HCOO]
(ads) - CO(g) + OH
(ads)
(5)
with the resulting hydroxyl species combining with the pre-
viously dissociated acidic hydrogen (reaction (1)) to form
water. Interestingly, however, although some water desorbs
at approximately the same temperature as CO (TD B 560 K),
the majority leaves the TiO2(110) surface at a signiﬁcantly
lower temperature (TD B 350–440 K). On the basis that any
CO formed would immediately desorb at these substrate
temperatures,115 the lower temperature water TPD feature
must arise from a process unrelated to formate decomposition
(reaction (5)). TPD from an
18O-enriched TiO2(110), in

combination with HREELS and SSIMS,115 suggest that this
water is produced through the following reaction:
OHb

(ads) + OHb

(ads) - H2O(g) + O-vac
(6)
where the hydroxyl species are those formed upon dissociative
adsorption of formic acid (reaction (1)). Given that these
hydroxyl species are bridging hydroxyls,122 the O-vac in reac-
tion (6) is almost certainly an Ob-vac, as illustrated in Fig. 23.
This deduction is supported by Bowker et al.’s128 STM images
from a formic acid exposed TiO2(110)11 surface annealed to
420 K, which indicate the presence of signiﬁcant quantities of
Ob-vacs. We note that when water is dosed onto a clean
surface (see section 3.1) recombinative desorption (reaction (6))
occurs at B490 K, so it is not clear why these OHb species
recombine
at
an
apparently
lower
temperature
here
(350–440 K).
HREELS elastic peak measurements115 indicate that these
Ob-vacs do not persist at higher temperatures, but are healed
in coincidence with the onset of formate decomposition. This
result suggests that defects of this type are integral to the
decomposition chemistry of formic acid on TiO2(110)11, i.e.
surface formate species interact directly with Ob-vacs during
decomposition. Accordingly, Wang et al.132 have proposed
that formate decomposition is initiated by the following step,
[HCOO]
(ads) + Ob-vac - [HCO]
(ads) + Ob
(7)
They suggest that CO(g) is then generated by loss of hydrogen
from the surface formyl species ([HCO]). In addition, this
reaction also explains the presence of formaldehyde (H2CO) in
the list of desorbed species in Table 3, as it can easily be
formed by combining formyl with a surface hydroxyl hydro-
gen. (We note that as a consequence of reaction (7) formate
oxygen should be incorporated into the TiO2(110) surface, and
that this process has been validated by Henderson.115)
A more complete description of the mechanism of formic
acid decomposition to form CO(g), along with H2O (i.e.
dehydration) has been put forward in the recent study by
Aizawa et al.,129 who have used both STM and ab initio
modelling. As already highlighted, these researchers image
three formate geometries at a substrate temperature of
350 K, namely Type A, Type B, and Type C in Fig. 22. The
latter two conﬁgurations involve the interaction of formate
with Ob-vacs, again suggesting a role for these defects in
formate decomposition. This possibility was addressed by
acquisition of consecutive STM images from the same area,
enabling the visualisation of dynamic processes, including
conversion between diﬀerent formate geometries and formate
decomposition. From such images it was determined, as
shown in Fig. 24, that Type C formate, which is bound in a
monodentate geometry plugging an Ob-vac, decomposes. This
result is consistent with Wang et al.’s proposal outlined
above,132 as Type C formate can be considered to be essen-
tially equivalent to the products of reaction (7). From these

entries for Henderson’s work115 are for a substrate (T B 100 K)
exposed to suﬃcient formic acid to form approximately a monolayer;
the CO2 data derive from a surface prepared similarly to that of Wang

Given the weight of evidence to date, this is apparently a very
reasonable mechanism, although further experimental eﬀort to
identify intermediates is required. Furthermore, this mechan-
ism can operate either in the presence or absence of a partial
pressure of formic acid, as no gas phase reactants are involved
once the formic acid has initially adsorbed (reaction (8)).
Hence, it is applicable to both the steady-state and TPD-type
(i.e.
measurements
performed
in
vacuum)
experimental
scenarios.
Table 3 shows that in addition to CO, CO2 desorbs from
TiO2(110) during TPD measurements, which points to formic
acid dehydrogenation (reaction (3)) occurring alongside dehy-
dration. However, CO2 constitutes a relatively small propor-
tion of the desorbed products, in particular in refs. 115 and
132, indicating that dehydrogenation is not favoured. This
result is consistent with Onishi et al.’s conclusion from steady-
state measurements114,131 that the primary channel for dehy-
drogenation involves a reaction between an adsorbed formate
and an incoming gas phase formic acid molecule, which is not
feasible under the conditions of the TPD experiments, i.e.
there is no gas phase formic acid present. On this basis, various
alternative routes, involving only adsorbed species, have been
proposed, although not as yet rigorously tested, for the CO2
production observed during TPD.114,115,132
Details of the bimolecular dehydrogenation reaction, which
occurs under steady-state conditions, involving [HCOO]
(ads)
and HCOOH(g), have very recently been explored theoretically
by Uemura et al.133 They conclude that the dehydrogenation
arises from the reaction between a Type A formate and a
HCOOH molecule weakly bound to an adjacent Ti5c. Inter-
estingly, unlike the dehydration mechanism, no defect site is
required, merely a series of three Ti5cs.. Clearly, experimental
work is required to test this theoretical prediction.
As regards decomposition of formic acid on reconstructed
TiO2(110), Bennett et al.130 have performed a study on the
x-linked 12 surface with STM. They acquired images from a
surface decorated with adsorbed formate whilst ramping the
temperature of the substrate. Further to reduction in adsor-
bate density with increasing temperature, they observed for-
mation of islands of 11 termination. They interpreted this
phenomenon as being due to the reaction of mobile Tin+
interstitials with oxygen from decomposing formate, a process
well-established for high temperature O2 exposure, as dis-
cussed in section 4.4.
5.2
Other carboxylic acids
5.2.1
Adsorption. To date, experimental evidence (e.g.
ref. 121, 134–140) indicates that monocarboxylic acids (i.e.
molecules with only one carboxyl group) typically mimic the
room temperature adsorption of formic acid on TiO2(110)11,
i.e. they form carboxylate moieties through acid hydrogen
cleavage, and adopt a bonding geometry comparable to that
displayed for formate in Fig. 21. Furthermore, smaller such
species exhibit an ordered (21) overlayer at saturation (e.g.
acetate ([H3CCOO]),134 propanoate ([H5C2COO]),121 and
trimethylacetate ([(H3C)3CCOO]).136
Concerning the fate of the acidic hydrogen, it is generally
believed that it bonds to a single bridging oxygen, forming
OHb, as outlined in section 5.1.1 for formic acid. Lately,
however, Lyubinetsky et al.141 have challenged this perception
through STM and HREELS measurements from trimethyla-
cetate (TMA) overlayers. They interpret their STM images of
isolated TMA species as indicating that the acidic hydrogen
attaches to a pair of bridging oxygens rather than a single one.
This bonding geometry is illustrated in Fig. 25. Given the
distance between the Obs (2.95 A
˚ ), such bonding would be
rather weak, and so they propose that the hydrogen may
dynamically oscillate between the two. Furthermore, they
claim that the adjacent TMA is required to stabilise this
geometry, and without it the hydrogen would simply bind to
a single Ob, as observed following H2O dissociation at Ob-vacs
(see section 3.1). HREELS data support their hypothesis in
that the O–H stretching mode expected for an OHb is not
observed on a TiO2(110)11 surface saturated with TMA.
This rather unexpected location for the acidic hydrogen, which
Lyubinetsky et al. conclude may pertain to other carboxylate
species on TiO2(110)11, requires further investigation.
Studies have also been performed for the adsorption on
TiO2(110)11 of molecules containing more than one carbox-
yl group. In particular, there has been interest in bi-isonico-
tinic acid (2,20-bipyridine-4,40-dicarboxylic acid), as it is the
surface binding ligand in important organometallic dyes for
TiO2-based solar cells. O 1s core level PES data, acquired from
TiO2(110)11 with a submonolayer coverage of this molecule,
indicate that both –COOH groups are deprotonated and that
all four oxygens are equivalent.142 To further elucidate the
adsorption geometry of this bi-isonicotinate, N K-edge NEX-
AFS measurements and theoretical modelling were under-
taken.142,143 A ball and stick model of the most likely
adsorption geometry is displayed in Fig. 26. Recently, the

adsorption on TiO2(110)11 of a complete organometallic dye
molecule (Ru(4,40-dicarboxy-2,20-bipyridine)2(NCS)2), incor-
porating two bi-isonicotinic acid ligands, has been visualised
with STM.144 From the height of the adsorbed molecule it was
deduced that it binds to the surface through two carboxylate
groups, which is consistent with the work on bi-isonicoti-
nate.142,143 Additionally, it was found that these molecules
preferentially adsorbed at step edges, which was concluded to
be due to the presence of poorly coordinated Ti atoms.
As for adsorption on reconstructed TiO2(110), there has
again been only limited work. Williams’s group145 have stu-
died room temperature adsorption of acetic acid on what we
assume to be the simple 12 phase. They conclude from
valence band PES data that surface acetate is formed, binding
in a similar way to acetate on the 11 surface, but with a
saturation coverage almost half that found on the 11. On the
grounds that their surface was comprised of Ti2O3 added rows,
they suggest that the acetate is adsorbed on Ti5c sites available
in the troughs between added rows (see Fig. 5). The same
group have also probed glycine (NH2CH2COOH) adsorption
on an apparently similar 12 surface.146 In this case, PES data
for a submonolayer coverage adsorbed at room temperature
are interpreted as indicating molecular dissociation beyond
simple acidic hydrogen loss. Speciﬁcally, they conclude that
the primary species on the surface is the glycine’s carboxyl
group, and that other components of the molecule have
desorbed. Qiu and Barteau138 have employed STM to image
glycine adsorption on x-linked TiO2(110)12. Similar to
Bennett et al.’s130 STM study of formic acid on x-linked
12, they found no ordering of the adsorbates. From these
STM images it is not possible to address the extent, if any, of
glycine decomposition.
5.2.2
Thermal decomposition. Investigations into the ther-
mal decomposition of both acetic and trimethylacetic acids on
TiO2(110)11 have been undertaken. Onishi et al.147 have
examined the decomposition of the former by preparing a
(21)[CH3COO] overlayer on TiO2(110), and then acquiring
a series of STM images with the substrate maintained at a
temperature of 510–540 K. They observed mobile bright
protrusions, which decreased in number with time. These
entities were assigned to acetates undergoing decomposition.
Larger immobile features, which disappeared at higher tem-
peratures, were ascribed to carbonaceous species resulting
from secondary reactions. Core level PES data recorded by
Idriss et al.148 also indicate the desorption of acetate in this
temperature region.
The thermal decomposition of trimethylacetic acid has been
studied by Henderson and co-workers,137 employing primarily
TPD. Observations largely mirror those found for formic acid
on TiO2(110)11, as detailed previously, although additional
species
are
desorbed
due
to
the
presence
of
the
‘(CH3)3C–’group rather than ‘H–’ in formic acid. TPD of an
ordered (21) TMA overlayer, formed at 300 K, shows that
CO, H2O, and isobutene (i-C4H8) are all primary decomposi-
tion products. CO and isobutene (i-C4H8) desorb at TD B
660 K, along with smaller quantities of H2O, methyl iso-
propenyl
ketone
(CH2
Q
C(CH3)C(
Q
O)CH3),
isobutane
(i-C4H10),
di-tert-butyl
ketone
((CH3)3CC(
Q
O)C(CH3)3)
and/or trimethylacetic acid. The primary H2O peak appears
at TD B 460 K, and 18O labelling measurements indicate that
reaction (6) is occurring, generating Ob-vacs. Also, analogous
to the thermal decomposition of adsorbed formate, these
Ob-vacs are healed during TMA decomposition. Hence, a
mechanism similar to the one proposed by Aizawa et al.129
for the dehydration of formic acid (reactions (8)–(12)) would
be consistent with these results, with the primary products,
namely CO and i-C4H8, being produced by:
[(CH3)3CCOO]
(ads, Type C)
- CO(g) + OHb

(g) + i-C4H8(g)
(13)
5.2.3
Photodecomposition. Motivated by interest in photo-
catalysis and related topics, eﬀort has also been applied to
understanding the photon induced chemistry of various or-
ganics on TiO2(110). Here, such work on acetic acid and
trimethylacetic acid is discussed, the photochemistry of alco-
hols adsorbed on TiO2(110) being covered in section 6.2.3.
Beginning with acetic acid, Idriss et al.148 have examined the
impact of UV radiation at room temperature on an overlayer
of acetate on TiO2(110)11, both in UHV and in the presence
O2 (B5  108 mbar). From C 1s core level PES spectra, it
was concluded that under UHV conditions exposure to UV
had no signiﬁcant eﬀect. In contrast, acetate was lost from the
surface when UV illumination was performed in the partial
pressure of O2. This result was interpreted as demonstrating
that UV excitation of physisorbed O2 molecules, possibly to
form O2

(ads) species, is required to initiate acetate decom-
position/desorption;
acetate
decomposition
is
expected,
although Idriss et al. do not provide any direct evidence of
this process.
A more extensive study of UV photon induced chemistry
has been conducted by Henderson and co-workers for tri-
methylacetic acid on TiO2(110)11.136,149,150 First, it should
be highlighted that, in contrast to Idriss et al.’s result for
adsorbed acetate,148 UV light does induce TMA decomposi-
tion under UHV conditions. STM images directly show that
TMA coverage is depleted upon exposure to UV photons (see
Fig. 27),136 and evidence for UV driven TMA decomposition,
rather than simple molecular desorption, emerges from the
monitoring of gas phase species with a mass spectrometer

during irradiation. At substrate temperatures of 200 K and
above, a signiﬁcant amount of CO2 is found to be evolved
during such measurements, along with, once the sample is at
300 K, isobutene (i-C4H8) and isobutane (i-C4H10). TPD, post
UV exposure, suggests that these latter two species are derived
from the thermal chemistry of adsorbed tert-butyl radicals
((CH3)3C–), which are formed in tandem with CO2 as a result
of the primary photon driven reaction, namely TMA C–C
bond cleavage giving rise to decarboxylation, i.e.
[(CH3)3C–COO]
(ads) + hn - CO2 + (CH3)3C–
(14)
Almost certainly, as is discussed in refs. 136 and 149, the
photon does not directly break the C–C bond, but rather
excites the TiO2 substrate, promoting an electron from the
valence band to the conduction band,
TiO2 + hn - e + h+
(15)
The hole (h+) is consumed by interaction with TMA, extract-
ing an electron from the p-system of the carboxylate group,
which leads to the C–C bond breaking. It is suggested that the
electron (e) is trapped at the surface reducing Ti4+ to Ti3+,
as is evidenced by EELS.136
Henderson and co-workers149 also found that the UV
induced TMA decomposition reaction was quenched much
more rapidly than expected on the basis of the remaining
reactant molecule density. This phenomenon was concluded to
be due to the accumulation of Ti3+ species in the surface
region, as just outlined, which interact with remaining TMA
species forming Ti3+–TMA entities, which are inert as regards
UV decomposition. Oxidation of these Ti3+ species by expos-
ing the surface to O2 re-initiates the reaction.
Further work concerning the role of O2 in the photodecom-
position of TMA is presented by Henderson and co-workers in
ref. 150. More speciﬁcally, this study focuses upon the inﬂu-
ence of O2 on the thermal chemistry of the tert-butyl radical
(reaction (14)). As indicated above, this species primarily
desorbs from the surface as either isobutene or isobutane.
For a saturated (21) TMA overlayer, mass spectrometry
demonstrates that, independent of O2 partial pressure, isobu-
tene desorption is favoured upon initial UV illumination. The
lack of sensitivity to O2 at this stage is attributed to a lack of
available adsorption sites within the overlayer. As irradiation
continues in UHV the isobutane yield simply increases and
plateaus, producing a constant isobutene : isobutane ratio
near 1 : 1. In O2, the variation in the isobutene : isobutane
ratio versus irradiation time is more complex. Initially, as in
UHV, there is a shift towards a 1 : 1 ratio, but with time
isobutene is again favoured; the precise proﬁle is dependent
upon the O2 partial pressure. From STM of reacted surfaces it
was found that the latter change can be correlated with a
variation in surface morphology. Under UHV conditions, UV
induced decomposition always occurs fairly randomly across
the surface, whereas in O2 extended voids appear in the TMA
overlayer coinciding with the shift in selectivity back towards
isobutene. Inside the voids it is concluded that adsorbed Ox
species reside, and that UV induced TMA decomposition is
enhanced at their borders, presumably at least partially due to
Ox species removing Ti3+ species, with the resulting tert-butyl
radical selectivity decomposing to isobutene. More speciﬁc
reaction details remain somewhat uncertain, although it is
suggested that TMA–TMA interactions may determine selec-
tivity, and more work is required for complete atomic scale
understanding. Finally, we note that the role of O2 outlined by
Henderson and co-workers is entirely diﬀerent to that ascribed
to it by Idriss et al. in the UV induced decomposition of
acetate,148 where they suppose that it directly initiates acetate
bond breaking.
6.
Alcohols
The reactivity of TiO2 with alcohols is important in a number
of technological applications. Methanol and ethanol, in parti-
cular, may be exploited as energy carriers in renewable
sources, and alcohols in general can act as simple model
contaminants to test environmental cleaning strategies, one
of which is catalytic oxidation to CO2.
In this section, we explore the dissociative and molecular
adsorption of alcohols as well as various decomposition
mechanisms. Methanol is discussed ﬁrst, followed by a series
of (C2–C8) aliphatic alcohols that are treated together as they
share the same type of chemistry. Photodecomposition is also
discussed in the case of 2-propanol and ethanol.
6.1
Methanol
6.1.1
Dissociative and molecular adsorption. TPD peaks
and shoulders found for CH3OH at B295 K, B350 K, and
B480 K are shown in Fig. 28.151 Peaks are also present at
B150 K and B165 K (oﬀ-scale in Fig. 28) which are assigned
to methanol multilayers and methanol adsorbed at Ob sites,
respectively. The assignment of the B150 K peak was based
on comparisons to methanol TPD from metals (e.g. ref. 152)
whilst the B165 K peak was assigned by analogy with the
behaviour of water on TiO2(110) (section 3.3). The intense
peak at B295 K is assigned to molecular desorption of
methanol adsorbed on Ti5c sites, whilst the small peak at
B480 K has a coverage consistent with that of the Ob-vac
density. In a SSIMS experiment analogous to the one de-
scribed
for
water
adsorption
(section
3.1),60
the
TiO-
(CH3OH)+ signal was shown to attenuate to near zero at
B295 K with the TiO(CH3O)+ signal attenuating above
B500 K. This identiﬁes the B295 K peak as a molecular
desorption peak and the B480 K peak as a CH3O/OHbr

recombinative peak resulting from methanol dissociated at
Ob-vacs.
When the surface is isotopically enriched with 18O before
exposure to CH3
16OH, CH3
16OH is preferentially desorbed at
B480 K. Given the SSIMS results, the lack of isotopic
scrambling of 18O/16O cannot be due to molecular desorption.
Instead the isotope studies indicate that the methyl group of
the methoxy is immobile, remaining attached to the 16O from
the dosed methanol. Therefore the recombinative desorption
of methanol at B480 K must rely on the mobility of hydrogen
from OHb.
The B350 K peak is much more diﬃcult to assign, with
both SSIMS data and HREELS spectra being inconclusive.
However, on the basis of similar behaviour following electron
bombardment,153 Henderson et al. tentatively assign the
B350 K peak to methanol dissociated at non-defective parts
of the surface, probably Ti5c sites. By combining static DFT
calculations with molecular dynamics simulations, Sa
´ nchez de
Armas et al.154 suggest that both molecular adsorption and
dissociation at Ti5c sites are viable, the preferred state being
highly dependent on the technical details of the calculation.
Onda et al.155,156 give some indirect evidence that methanol
dissociates at Ti5c sites. Using 2PP spectroscopy, they detect
an empty wet electron state B2.2–2.4 eV above EF, analogous
to that found for water.71 However, for water this state was
only present when the surface had appreciable Ob-vac density,
achieved by vacuum annealing. These vacancies were required
in order to produce the OHb sites associated with the wet
electron state. When the surface was annealed in O2, the wet
electron state did not form. In contrast, the wet electron state
forms on a methanol-exposed surface whether Ob-vacs are
present or not. The diﬀerent behaviour can be explained if it is
not necessary for Ob-vacs to be present in order to dissociate
methanol. Because of the importance of hole–electron separa-
tion in photocatalysis, it is signiﬁcant that whilst electrons
injected into the wet electron state associated with water decay
within 15 femtoseconds,71 wet electrons can be stabilised by
methanol into the picosecond range.156
Zhang et al.157 give direct evidence for the dissociation of
methanol in Ob-vacs. Fig. 29b shows the TiO2(110) surface
after a low exposure to methanol. Bright spots are observed in
positions previously taken by Ob-vacs. These bright spots were
assigned as methoxy and OHb pairs, by analogy with the OHb
pairs formed from water exposure.68 Further exposure to
methanol leads to the appearance of darker spots as well as
an increase in the number of bright spots (Fig. 29c). The
darker spots are assigned to OHb which have migrated along
[1
10] via proton exchange with molecularly adsorbed methanol
in a similar way to that described for water in section 3.2.68
Following a scan at a raised bias of +3 V, the darker spots
are removed, whereas the brighter spots remain. As it has
already been shown that OHb can be removed by ca. +3 V tip
bias, the darker species are conﬁrmed as OHb,28 and the
brighter spots can be assigned to methoxy groups. As the

methoxy groups take the positions of the reacting Ob-vacs, this
indicates that the CH3O–H bond is broken rather than the
CH3–OH bond.
Zhang et al. do not discuss whether they observe methoxy or
methanol species at the Ti5c sites. However, inspection of
Fig. 29b, reveals the presence of a few new bright spots on
the bright (Ti5c) rows which may be due to either molecular
methanol or methoxy dissociated at Ti5c sites.
6.1.2
Decomposition. Farfan-Arribas and Madix found a
quite diﬀerent behaviour in the high temperature region of
their methanol TPD spectra.158 Instead of a methanol peak at
B480 K, peaks for methanol and formaldehyde evolved at
B630 K. This discrepancy with respect to the results of
Henderson et al. was attributed to the diﬀerent sample pre-
paration methods used. Henderson et al.151 annealed their
sample in UHV, as described in section 2. On the other hand,
in order to assess the inﬂuence of defects on reactivity,
Farfan-Arribas and Madix prepared their surfaces by ﬁrst
annealing, then cooling to room temperature in B2.7  106
mbar O2, which can lead to various surface terminations
together with the presence of Oad, as discussed in section 4.
When O2 was deliberately pre-dosed onto a UHV annealed
TiO2(110) surface before exposure to methanol, formaldehyde
evolved at B625 K together with methanol, regardless of the
temperature of O2 exposure (150–715 K).151 As the mass 29
signal can have contributions from formaldehyde and metha-
nol cracking, the mass 29 traces are scaled to the mass 31
(methanol) traces. In this way, any formaldehyde desorption
shows up as the diﬀerence between the two curves as shown in
Fig. 30. The partition between formaldehyde and methanol
contained in the B625 K peaks is almost equal for all O2
exposures, suggestive of a disproportionation reaction be-
tween two methoxy groups. When O2 is pre-exposed onto
the surface at B150 K, an additional formaldehyde shoulder
evolves at low temperature (B250 K) which was attributed to
a molecular O2
 species abstracting a hydrogen atom from the
methyl group of methanol.
6.2
C2–C8 aliphatic alcohols
6.2.1
Dissociative and molecular adsorption. Alcohol TPD
spectra in general follow the basic pattern found for methanol
in Fig. 28. Such spectra have been taken for ethanol,
2-propanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol,
1-octanol, 2-octanol, 3-octanol, and 4-octanol.159–165 Taking
2-propanol as an example, there is a sharp peak at B160 K
which cannot be saturated and has zero order desorption
kinetics, consistent with a multilayer. Just above this is a
feature tentatively assigned to 2-propanol molecules bound
to the Ob atoms. Two peaks between B250 K and B450 K
can be attributed to desorption of 2-propanol molecularly
adsorbed at Ti5c sites and/or recombination of OHb and
propoxy dissociated at Ti5c. Finally, a high temperature peak
is found at B560 K, which becomes more intense with a
greater Ob-vac density and can therefore be assigned to a
recombinative reaction of propoxy at Ob-vacs and OHb.
Zhang et al.164 recorded STM images before and after
exposure to 2-butanol at B300 K. Again, in a similar way
to experiments using methanol, 2-butoxy/OHb pairs are found
where Ob-vacs were previously positioned. High resolution
images show that the OHb species appear as fainter spots next
to the 2-butoxy species (see Fig. 31). Isolated OHb were also
observed and attributed to OHb which have diﬀused in the
[1
10] direction via proton exchange with 2-butanol, after
similar conclusions with methanol and water.68,157 As the
2-butoxy species take the positions of the Ob-vacs ﬁlled, this
indicates that, as with methanol,157 it is the O–H bond which
breaks to form the 2-butoxy species. Bright spots can also be
observed on the bright Ti5c rows, one of which was seen ﬁlling
an Ob-vac in the sequential STM images of Fig. 31. This
sequence was interpreted as molecular 2-butanol dissociating
in an Ob-vac. As the adsorption behaviour of ROH, where R
= H, CH3 and 2-butyl, is similar (except for the question of
whether ROH dissociates at Ti5c sites where it is generally
thought that there is some dissociation for alcohols at Ti5c sites
but not for water), Zhang et al. suggest that all alcohols may
follow this behaviour: (i) the RO–H bond is cleaved at the
Ob-vac sites with RO– taking the place of the Ob-vac and (ii)
ROH adsorbs at Ti5c sites and facilitates diﬀusion of the OHb
groups formed from dissociation at Ob-vacs.
6.2.2
Thermal decomposition. Whilst the adsorption beha-
viour of alcohols in general seem to follow that of methanol,
additional reaction paths are revealed when masses in addition

to alcohol are tracked in TPD. One of these reactions is
dehydration to alkene. Fig. 32 shows propene TPD spectra
alongside traces for 2-propanol and water after TiO2(110) was
exposed to mono-deuterated 2-propanol (2-PrOD). Focusing
ﬁrst on the high temperature (HT) region, it can be seen that
the propene and 2-PrOH signals peak at B575 K.
In an earlier study by Farfan-Arribas and Madix,160 the
2-PrOH and equivalent 1-PrOH peaks were found B25 K and
B40 K lower than the propene peaks, respectively. Similarly,
Gamble et al.162 and Farfan-Arribas and Madix,160 respec-
tively, found the equivalent ethanol peak B7.5 K and B15 K
lower than the ethene peak. Farfan-Arribas and Madix also
detected CO and H2 peaks B10–110 K higher than the alcohol
peaks for 2-PrOH and 1-PrOH whereas Dohna
´ lek and co-
workers ﬁnd no evidence for H2 or CO desorption for either
these or any other alcohols tested.159,163 Diﬀerent sample
preparation conditions may account for the appearance of
H2 and CO in the work of Farfan-Arribas and Madix.
Dohna
´ lek and co-workers prepared their surfaces by annea-
ling in UHV as described in section 2. Whilst Gamble et al.
and Farfan-Arribas and Madix both annealed their samples in
an O2 pressure (1106 and 2.7106 mbar, respectively),
Farfan-Arribas and Madix also allowed their sample to cool
to room temperature in the same O2 pressure, a procedure
which we know from section 4 may lead to the formation of
Oad. The reason for the higher temperature onset of the alkene
peaks in the earlier work is unclear, with Bondarchuk et al.159
suggesting the temperature diﬀerences are within experimental
error, at least for 2-propanol (and therefore implicitly for
ethanol where the temperature oﬀset is less).
Returning to Fig. 32: the B575 K propene and 2-PrOH
peaks are sandwiched by two water peaks—one B60 K below
at B515 K, the other B5 K higher at B580 K. The water peak
at B515 K is well understood and arises from the recombina-
tion of two OHb groups (see section 3.1 for further details and
notice that due to an oﬀset of the temperature scale compared
with the earlier work, the peak is slightly shifted from B490
K). In Fig. 32, this B515 K water peak is dominated by D2O
and must therefore arise from ODb formed from dissociated
2-PrOD. The propene evolved from 2-PrOD is always C3H6,
ruling out any mechanism which incorporates the O–H hydro-
gen into the resulting alkene. For ethanol, Gamble et al.162
then Kim et al.165 tested the dehydration mechanism by using
CD3CH2OH, with the product always being CD2CH2. This is
a key result because it shows that it is the C2 carbon–hydrogen
bond that is eliminated.

fragmentation of 2-PrOD traced by mass 46 have been subtracted
from the mass 18, 19, 20, 41, and 45 curves to obtain the net

respectively. Shaded regions correspond to the desorption of reactants
and products from TiO2(110). The unshaded regions in the HDO and

There are other notable isotope eﬀects. When 2-PrOD8 is
used, the propene peak is found B10 K higher than when
either 2-PrOH or 2-PrOD is used. This indicates that C–H (or
C–D) bond stretching is involved in the rate-determining step
for propene formation. Likewise, in the earlier ethanol
study,162 CD3CH2OH gave an ethene peak B8.5 K higher
than CH3CH2OD, showing speciﬁcally that it is the C2
carbon–hydrogen bond which is involved in the rate-determin-
ing step.
The HT dehydration mechanism proposed by Bondarchuk
et al.159 is shown in Fig. 33 using 2-propanol as an example. As
the temperature increases, a hydrogen atom connected to the
C2 carbon forms a bond with an Ob atom so that the
2-propoxy thermally passes through a cyclic activated complex
(Ob–C–C–H–Ob) that concertedly leads to the formation of
propene and OHb. The evolved OHb recombines either with a
propoxy to form 2-PrOH or another OHb to form H2O. These
two reactions explain the desorption of non-deuterated
2-PrOH at B575 K and water at B580 K, when 2-PrOD is
used as in Fig. 32. Conversely, when the surface was exposed
to 1-C3D7OH,160 fully-deuterated 1-propanol desorbs in this
HT peak.
Alkyl substituents display an inductive eﬀect whereby elec-
tron density is released to carbon atoms connected to electro-
negative atoms. Larger R groups have a greater inductive
eﬀect, as do multiple R groups. By investigating the peak
desorption temperatures for a number of alcohols, Kim
et al.165 showed that alcohols with more inductive R groups
convert to the alkene at lower temperatures. In line with this,
Fig. 34 shows that the temperature of the HT alkene peaks
increases from tertiary to secondary, and ﬁnally to primary
alcohols. They concluded that the induction stabilises the C1
carbond+–Ob bond in their proposed cyclic complex, thereby
reducing the activation energy for alkene formation. This
dependence on the inductive eﬀect gives evidence for hetero-
lytic bond cleavage during the dehydration of these alcohols
and therefore conﬂicts with a radical mechanism proposed by
Farfan-Arribas and Madix.160 Furthermore, the observation
that both C1 carbon–Ob elongation and C2 carbon–H stretch-
ing aﬀects the TPD peak positions indicates that both are
involved in the rate-determining step, in line with the cyclic
complex proposed.159
We turn now to the low temperature (LT) region in Fig. 32
where it is apparent that propene is also produced.159,163 This
is consistent with the TPD results of Gamble et al. where an
ethene peak evolved from ethanol TPD at B360 K as well as
B650 K.162 Kim et al.163 showed that alkene evolution in this
temperature range is not aﬀected by the presence of Ob-vacs.
This was tested by pre-dosing the TiO2(110) with water in
order to ﬁll the Ob-vacs with OHb. This suppressed the HT
alkene channel but in the LT region, propene TPD spectra
were identical to those recorded without water pre-dosing.
There are two signiﬁcant features of the LT TPD region in
Fig. 32: (1) a 2-PrOH peak appears at a similar temperature to
Fig. 33
Schematic representation of the proposed reaction mechan-
ism of 2-propoxy and hydroxyl groups at high temperature (4500 K).
The red circles denote original positions of Ob-vacs which are ﬁlled
with the oxygen from 2-propoxy when 2-propanol dissociates. The
yellow circles represent the hydrogen which forms the accompanying
OHb species. At 520 K, the hydrogens are mobile along the Ob rows
and can react to form water that desorbs leaving a new Ob-vac (blue
circle with a dashed red outline). At 570 K, 2-propoxy groups react by
dehydration to form propene by C2–H and C1–Ob bond breaking.
This leaves further OHb groups with an increasing concentration as
propene forms and as these OHb react together, the second water
desorption peak forms. Reproduced from ref. 159 with permission. r

TPD spectra of alkene formation from 10 alcohols dosed on
TiO2(110) at 100 K. The spectra are grouped as primary, secondary,
and tertiary alcohols. The net alkene desorption spectra shown were
obtained by subtracting the fragmentation contributions of molecular
alcohol. Mass 27 and 41 were used for ethene and propene, respec-
tively, and mass 56 was used for butenes and octenes. The alcohol dose
in each case was that which saturates the Ob-vacs and the Ti5c sites. All
spectra were normalized to the HT alkene desorption peaks. The
surface in each case contained a density of 0.035 ML Ob-vacs before
exposure to alcohol. Modiﬁed from ref. 163 with permission.

the LT propene peak, which is surprising because the alcohol
dosed was 2-PrOD; (2) a broad D2O feature appears between
B250–400 K with local peaks at B290 K and B330 K. The
lower temperature peak at B290 K corresponds to molecular
desorption of water adsorbed at Ti5c sites (see section 3.1 and
notice that the equivalent peak was found at B265 K due to
systematic oﬀset in the temperatures) but the origin of the
peak at B330 K is unknown.
Fig. 34 shows the LT channel is open for 7 of the 10 alcohols
tested, the exceptions being for 3-octanol, 4-octanol, and tert-
butanol. From this, Kim et al.163 suggest that for the LT
channel to proceed, one R group must be hydrogen and one of
the other R groups must either be hydrogen again or CH3.
The tentative reaction mechanism proposed by Kim et al.163
and illustrated in Fig. 35 can explain all these observations.
The reaction involves one alcohol and one alkoxy both
adsorbed on Ti5c sites randomly meeting with a speciﬁc
orientation.
Using
2-PrOD
as
an
example,
2-propoxy
abstracts H from the 2-propoxy group of 2-PrOD explaining
the desorption of non-deuterated 2-PrOH. The previously
adsorbed 2-PrOD which has lost its H atom to the 2-propoxy
rearranges and desorbs as propene, leaving behind an OD
group attached to Ti5c (ODt). This ODt group can then
recombine with ODb (already formed by dissociation of
2-PrOD at either Ti5c sites or Ob-vacs) so there is no net loss
or gain of O at the surface. Desorption of D2O thus formed
could be responsible for the peak at B330 K, which seems
reasonable given that OHt groups recombine with each other
at B290–320 K (see sections 4.1 and 4.3). The requirement for
the alcohol and alkoxy to meet in a speciﬁc orientation
accounts for the fact that the bulkier alcohols do not form
alkenes in the LT region.
There is another HT pathway active only for some of the
alcohols studied, namely dehydrogenation to the correspond-
ing aldehyde. As described in section 6.1.2, for aldehyde TPD
spectra, masses with contributions from both the parent
alcohol and the aldehyde are tracked. These are scaled and
superimposed on traces from the parent alcohol. In this way,
the diﬀerence between the curves corresponds to the aldehyde
yield. Following this procedure, Kim et al.163 show that
aldehydes evolve at about the same temperature as the corre-
sponding HT alcohol desorption peak. As such, dehydrogena-
tion was attributed to alkoxy adsorbed at the Ob-vacs.
Aldehyde formation has only been observed for primary
alcohols.160,163 Based on the assumption that a hydrogen atom
is abstracted directly from the C1 carbon to form aldehyde,
this selection rule can be quite simply understood. Tertiary
alcohols can be excluded immediately because they have no
such hydrogen species by deﬁnition. Assuming that the two
C1–H bonds are equivalent in primary alcohols, then the
probability for dehydrogenation of primary alcohols, based
only on the presence of two C1 hydrogen atoms rather than
one, must be twice that of secondary alcohols. Added to this, it
has already been shown that the activation energy for dehy-
dration of secondary alcohols is lower than for primary
alcohols. Hence, for secondary alcohols, dehydrogenation will
compete less successfully against dehydration than it would for
primary alcohols.
Kim et al.163 found the aldehyde yield to be much smaller
than the alkene and alcohol yields for the alcohols tested. For
example, the propanal yield from 1-propanol was about 10%
of the HT propene yield. In the case of ethanol, Gamble
et al.162 did not detect any signiﬁcant amount of acetaldehyde,
presumably because the signal was too weak. On the other
hand, Farfan-Arribas and Madix160 found an equal three-way
partition of alcohol, alkene, and aldehyde in the HT region for
both ethanol and 1-propanol. As discussed for the formation
of CO, this divergence from the results of Gamble et al. and
Kim et al. may be due to diﬀerences in sample preparation.
6.2.3
Photodecomposition. Using molecular beam studies,
Brinkley and Engel found a new dehydrogenation pathway for
2-propanol.166,167 A mixed beam of O2 and 2-propanol in a
7 : 1 ratio was directed at the TiO2(110) surface which was then
irradiated with UV light. When the light was switched on, a
mass spectrometer detected intense transient peaks for acetone
and water, both of which decayed in seconds then remained
constant until the light was switched oﬀ. The transient peaks
are due to the surface being saturated with O2 and 2-propanol
in the interval before the light was switched on. This leads to a
rapid initial reaction when the light is ﬁrst switched on, but
once the excess O2 and 2-propanol are consumed in the
production of acetone, the reaction becomes limited by the
molecular beam ﬂux and the curves fall to steady-state levels.
The acetone and water yields are approximately equal, sug-
gesting that one 2-propanol molecule reacts with half an O2
molecule to form one acetone molecule and one water
molecule.
Fig. 35
Schematic of proposed LT dehydration mechanism. The key
intermediate is a complex (step II) formed by interaction of an
oriented alkoxy with an oriented chemisorbed alcohol (step I). There
is a concerted rearrangement that involves a C2 hydrogen coupling to
the alkoxy oxygen and simultaneous cleavage of the C–O bond of the
chemisorbed alcohol. Step III illustrates the ﬁnal recombinative
desorption of D2O. Reproduced from ref. 163 with permission. r

The same reaction was also performed ‘statically’. In this
case, the same 2-propanol–O2 mixture was beamed onto a
TiO2(110) surface held at B185 K, after which the surface was
irradiated with UV light with the molecular beam switched oﬀ.
Any adsorbates were then desorbed into a mass spectrometer
to measure the total amount of acetone produced, which
maximised at B0.17 ML. On a fully oxidised surface, pre-
pared by annealing in 1.3  106 mbar O2 then cooling in the
same O2 pressure to 300 K, the maximum amount of acetone
produced fell to B0.08 ML, but did not reduce completely.
This led Brinkley and Engel to conclude that about half of the
acetone originated from 2-propanol somehow associated with
Ob-vacs, with the other half coming from 2-propanol at other
defect sites, such as step edges. Ob-vacs were not thought to
participate directly in the reaction because the oxidising con-
ditions of the experiment would ﬁll them. Given what is now
known about the behaviour of O2 on TiO2(110) (see section 4),
the importance of the Ob-vacs may lie in facilitating the
formation of Oad species. Brinkley and Engel suggest that
photoexcited electrons are captured by O2, thus allowing the
holes (h+) to attack the 2-propanol molecules and initiate
dehydrogenation to acetone.
By tracking the C 1s peaks using core level PES, Jayaweera
et al.168 monitored the eﬀect of UV illumination on ethanol
adsorbed on TiO2(110). A small peak evolved at B290 eV that
was attributed to either acetate or formate anions. When the
same procedure is followed in a pressure of 1.3  106 mbar
O2, a much clearer B290 eV peak developed. Thus the
reaction on the clean surface was attributed to background
O2, the clean surfaces being prepared by annealing in
6.7  105 mbar O2. By comparison with work on powdered
TiO2,169 Jayaweera et al. conclude that the ﬁrst step in the
reaction is dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde, after which
further oxidation forms either acetate or formate, with CO2
being released in the latter case. The initial step in the
mechanism proposed by Jayaweera et al. is the same as that
proposed by Brinkley and Engel, i.e. O2 captures photoexcited
electrons.167 However, the next step in Jayaweera et al.’s
proposed mechanism diﬀers in that they envisage a direct
reaction between ethoxy and O2
. Further work is needed in
order to achieve an atomic level understanding of both these
photoreactions.

Outlook
Whilst not yet approaching our level of understanding of
metal surfaces, our knowledge of oxide surface chemistry
has developed considerably over the last decade or so. This
is especially so in the case of the model oxide surface
TiO2(110), where trends are clearly emerging that are quite
diﬀerent to the behaviour of metals. In particular, the role of
defects such as O vacancies has now been evaluated in
exquisite detail and it is clear that they play a crucial role in
surface reactions. This evaluation has involved the application
of scanning probe methods in combination with ﬁrst principles
calculations, both of which have followed mechanistic studies
using ‘conventional’ methods.
There is a clear need to further extend the surface reaction
studies to other types of metal oxide surface in order to
evaluate trends in reaction mechanisms across diﬀerent oxide
surfaces. Iron oxides would be good initial candidates since
Fe2O3 is a promising catalyst, for instance in the oxidation of
benzene and chlorobenzene, and various FexOy compounds
play an important role in geochemistry. Of course, there have
been a number of surface chemistry studies of metal oxide
surfaces other than TiO2(110), including those of iron oxides,
but very few of these match the mechanistic detail demon-
strated in this review.
In the near future there is no doubt that a lot of attention
will be focused on studies at elevated pressures and at the
solid–liquid interface. Photon-in photon-out techniques, such
as SXRD, will be employed, as well as approaches modiﬁed to
operate in the high pressure regime, e.g. high-pressure PES,
which has already been applied to the TiO2(110)11/water
system.87,88 An area of particular topical interest is the inter-
face between light harvesting surfaces (e.g. TiO2) and liquid
water in connection with photocatalysis. Ultra-fast timing
measurements may also have a signiﬁcant impact here. It
might be possible to use pump probe measurements, involving
a UV pump and soft X-ray probe to look at charge transfer
processes following the light harvesting event. It has already
proved possible to measure the 15 fs lifetime of a ‘wet electron
state’ on TiO2(110) using two-photon photoemission.71
Material in this review highlights the enormous impact that
scanning probe methods have had on our understanding of
reactions at oxide surfaces. However, the lack of chemical
speciﬁcity with STM and AFM is a limitation. STM-inelastic
electron tunnelling spectroscopy could be a solution; this is a
technique that can be used to measure the vibrational spec-
trum of a single molecule.170,171 Another technique that can be
used to image with chemical speciﬁcity is X-ray photoelectron
microscopy.172,173 Although this is currently limited to a
spatial resolution of 20 nm or so, it is hoped that this will
improve to 2 nm over the next decade. Realising this goal
would open new vistas.
