Water on TiO2110 is the most widely studied water-oxide interface, yet questions about water dissociation
and hydrogen bonding are controversial. Here we report density-functional theory simulations which show that
water does not dissociate at the coverages examined. The aqueous ﬁlm is layered, with slow moving molecules
in the contact layer and fast moving molecules in a second layer, revealing strongly inhomogeneous dynamics
of the interfacial water. Hydrogen bonding between the ﬁrst and second layers is observed as is the exchange
of water molecules. These results help to resolve a number of controversies pertaining to the molecular scale
behavior of water on TiO2 and provide insight in to the structure and dynamics of water-solid interfaces by,
e.g., demonstrating that water dynamics can vary on the Angström length scale and that the presence of second
layer water molecules can cause those in the ﬁrst layer to reorient.

Under ambient conditions most solid surfaces are covered
by a thin ﬁlm of water. Of all the many water-solid inter-
faces, there are few if any of more contemporary scientiﬁc
and technological importance than those between water and
titanium dioxide TiO2. Water-TiO2 interfaces are relevant
to photocatalysis, gas sensors, and biocompatible devices not
to mention the varied applications of TiO2 in pigments and
coatings. Motivated by the desire to better understand and
ultimately control processes at wet TiO2 surfaces as well as
to answer fundamental questions of wetting and the proper-
ties of interfacial water, these systems have been intensively
investigated. The rutile TiO2110-water interface is the most
widely studied model system and to it almost every surface-
sensitive probe has been employed in pursuit of a clear
molecular-level description e.g., Refs. 1–18.
Despite the enormous body of work on water-TiO2110
interfaces, a number of crucial issues remain controversial.
First, there is the long-standing debate on which adsorption
state the water molecules are in at the interface: dissociated
or molecular? Many experimental studies have indicated that
oxygen defect sites are required for dissociation.3,4,6,7 How-
ever, density-functional theory DFT studies predict either
molecular or dissociative adsorption on the perfect defect-
free surface with results being sensitive to slab thickness,
coverage, and exchange-correlation xc functional.9–14,16–18
Second, there is the question of the hydrogen bond HB
network at the interface at coverages in excess of 1 mono-
layer ML, where 1 ML is deﬁned as one water per ﬁvefold
coordinated Ti site. Speciﬁcally, the seemingly simple ques-
tion of whether there are HBs between the ﬁrst and second
interfacial water “layers” is under debate. Campbell and
co-workers3 interpreted work-function measurements as an
indication of interlayer HBs, a view supported by recent
electron-stimulated desorption ESD measurements.19 How-
ever, spectroscopic measurements high-resolution electron-
energy-loss spectroscopy HREELS Ref. 4 did not show
any redshift in the O-H stretching region upon going from 1
ML to multilayer adsorption, an observation that was inter-
preted as evidence against interlayer HBs. Answering these
particular questions is not only essential for understanding
water on TiO2 but it also has potential to reveal general
insight into the behavior of interfacial water through detailed
examination of a well-deﬁned model system. These are ques-
tions that can ideally be tackled with ab initio molecular
dynamics AIMD. In AIMD the interatomic interactions are
determined from the electronic-structure generally DFT,
and real-time dynamics and thermal ﬂuctuations at ﬁnite
temperature can be explored. However, AIMD simulations of
liquid
water-solid
interfaces
are
computationally
very
demanding12–14,16,20 and only in the last few years have
meaningful simulations of liquid water-solid interfaces been
possible.
Here, we report on extensive DFT simulations aimed at
clarifying several fundamental yet unresolved aspects of the
structure and dynamics of water on the perfect defect-free
TiO2110 surface. Our calculations with various semilocal
and hybrid xc functionals indicate that water does not disso-
ciate
in

ML to
multilayer. The molecules within the liquid ﬁlm adsorb in at
least two distinct layers: those in the ﬁrst layer diffuse slowly
and bond strongly to ﬁvefold coordinated Ti sites; those in
the second layer interact weakly with the substrate and dif-
fuse rapidly. This reveals that the dynamics of interfacial
water can be strongly inhomogeneous, varying on the Ang-
ström length scale. Hydrogen bonding between the ﬁrst and
second layers is observed as is the exchange of molecules
between the layers. The presence of second layer water mol-
ecules causes those in the ﬁrst layer to reorient, indicating
that the monolayer is a model of at best limited applicability
to understanding the aqueous water-TiO2 interface. These
ﬁndings help to resolve a number of longstanding debates in
the literature and underscore the complex nature of the struc-
ture and dynamics of aqueous water ﬁlms on ﬂat hydrophillic
surfaces.
The calculations reported here have been performed with
two codes. The plane-wave basis set code VASP Refs. 21 and
22 has been used to explore the sensitivity of the results to
xc functional and slab thickness. The mixed Gaussian and
plane-wave basis set code CP2K/QUICKSTEP Ref. 23 has
been used mostly for the AIMD simulations. In the AIMD
simulations the canonical ensemble was employed with a
target temperature of 360 K, maintained with a Nose-Hoover
chain thermostat. Further computational details are given in
the supplementary information24 and the good agreement be-

tween the two codes can be seen from Fig. 1.
To begin, we examine how slab thickness and xc func-
tional affect the picture that emerges for a water monolayer
at 0 K. At this stage the focus is on three common general-
ized gradient approximation functionals PBE,25 RPBE,26
and BLYP Refs. 27 and 28. At 1 ML the two states of
interest are a pure molecular INTACT state in which water
molecules adsorb at ﬁvefold coordinated Ti sites Ti5c and a
partially dissociated PDIS state in which every second wa-
ter molecule at the Ti5c sites has dissociated. In Figs.
1a–1c, the relative energies of these states is plotted as a
function of slab thickness. Clearly the relative energies of the
two states oscillate strongly, as discussed before e.g., Refs. 9
and 17. However the key point, which has hitherto been a
matter of debate,9–12,14,16–18,20,29 is that for the thickest slabs
all three functionals give essentially the same result, namely,
that the INTACT state is more stable than the PDIS state by
about 0.05 eV/water to 0.1 eV/water. The conclusion
that the INTACT state is more stable than the PDIS state is
not altered if hybrid xc functionals such as PBE0,30
HSE06,31 and B3LYP Refs. 28 and 32 are used Table I or
if van der Waals forces are accounted for.33 Finally, we note
that at a lower coverage of 0.5 ML, the intact water state is
again preferred over the dissociated DIS state when a suf-
ﬁciently thick slab is used Fig. 1d and Table I.
To establish if ﬁnite-temperature or kinetic29 effects are
relevant to the question of water dissociation, AIMD simu-
lations were carried out for water ﬁlms on TiO2 at 360 K
with PBE. AIMD simulations were performed at 1 ML and
for a multilayer ﬁlm Fig. 2a on three, four, and six-layer
TiO2 slabs. The picture that emerges from AIMD is consis-
tent with the total-energy calculations: on the four- and six-
layer slabs water does not dissociate but on the three-layer
slab some water molecules do half the molecules in the ﬁrst
layer. Since the previous AIMD studies of this system were
performed on a three-layer slab,12,16 we suggest that the dis-

sociation observed in these studies is a consequence of the
surface model employed. Overall, the fact that a consistent
picture emerges from the range of simulations reported here
at both 0 K and ﬁnite temperature with functionals that have
quite different treatments of exchange and correlation and
yield, e.g., different TiO2 band gaps, covalent, and hydrogen
bond strengths provides strong evidence against dissocia-
tion.
Having established that water does not dissociate on
TiO2110 and that this is adequately reﬂected with a four-
layer slab, we now examine certain properties of the water
ﬁlm. An overview is provided by the planar-averaged density
along the surface normal Fig. 2b. This is characterized by
a large peak in the density of 3 g/cm3 at 2.1 Å from the
surface. The high-density maximum indicates that molecules
in this layer are adsorbed at well-deﬁned surface sites; as we
show below these are the molecules at the Ti5c sites referred
to as “H2OTi” molecules. Beyond the ﬁrst layer are two
other, less-well-deﬁned layers. The second layer is centered
at a height of 3.8 Å and corresponds to water at the Obr
sites “H2Obr” molecules. The weak third layer is just about
discernible and is associated with molecules that act as HB
bridges between adjacent H2Obr molecules. Outside the third
layer, from 6 Å, the oscillations are less pronounced and
the bulk density of 1 g/cm3 is obtained. While the layer-
ing and density oscillations observed here are a general fea-
ture of solid-liquid interfaces, the detailed nature of the os-
cillations are speciﬁc to water on TiO2110. Indeed it is
encouraging that the ﬁrst hydration peak appears to be in
excellent agreement with the peak in the oxygen density pro-
ﬁle observed at 2.120.02 Å with x-ray diffraction.5
Let us focus on the molecules in the contact layer. Figure
3a displays spatial probability distribution functions pro-
jected on to the TiO2 surface for the O and H atoms within
the contact layer. Consistent with the high peak in the density
proﬁle there is indeed a high degree of order within the ﬁrst
layer, wherein the molecules are adsorbed above Ti5c sites.
Most Ti5c sites are occupied during the course of the AIMD
simulation with the effect that the time-averaged coverage in
this layer is close to 1 ML 0.84 ML. The H2OTi molecules
are generally adsorbed with their dipoles inclined slightly
away from the surface. This is shown by the snapshot in Fig.
2a and quantiﬁed by the orientational order parameter, ,
reported in Fig. 2c.  is deﬁned as the average of the cosine
of the angle between the water dipole and the surface nor-
mal. The large positive value of 0.6 implies an aniso-
tropic water distribution with the dipole moments inclined by
about 35° from the surface. The H2OTi molecules form sev-
eral distinct types of HBs. Speciﬁcally, they can donate and
accept HBs to water molecules at adjacent Ti5c sites Fig.
3c, they can donate HBs to the O bridge sites Figs. 3c
and 3d, and they can donate and accept HBs to and from
water molecules in the second layer Figs. 3d and 3e.
Using a geometric deﬁnition of hydrogen bonding,34 the av-
erage number of HBs each H2OTi is involved in is 2.2.
Although our simulations reveal HBs between the ﬁrst
and second layers, the existence of interlayer HBs is under
debate. This debate originates in HREELS experiments
which did not show a redshift in the O-H stretching region
upon going from monolayer to multilayer.4 To address this
we used AIMD to calculate vibrational frequency spectra for
the monolayer and multilayer ﬁlms Fig. S2. The key ﬁnd-
ing is that for the monolayer the molecules rearrange and
compensate for the missing HBs to the second layer by
“tightening up” the HBs in the plane parallel to the surface.
This can be seen by comparing the spatial probability distri-
butions for the monolayer simulation Fig. 3b with the
results from the ﬁrst layer beneath the water ﬁlm Fig. 3a.
Indeed the average number of HBs per H2OTi in the case of
a monolayer remains at 2.2, identical to the value obtained
for the ﬁrst wetting layer in the multilayer. Likewise the
relevant HB peak in the O-H O-D stretching region is un-
changed upon going from the monolayer to the multilayer
Fig. S2a. The rearrangement of the HBs at water ﬁlm
coverages and the resultant similar number of HBs in the
ﬁrst layer for the monolayer and the multilayer helps to ex-
plain the longstanding puzzle on the existence of interlayer
HBs.3,4,19 Note that an equivalent set of simulations on a
three-layer slab upon which water dissociates does not yield
spectra that can explain the HREELS experiments Fig.
S2b, thus providing further evidence against dissociation.
Not only do the 1 ML simulations allow the issue of inter-
layer HBs to be addressed but they show that the structure of
the ﬁrst layer is perturbed by the presence of the water ﬁlm
cf. Figs. 3a and 3b. A general implication of this is that
the monolayer is a model of at best limited applicability to
understanding the liquid water-TiO2 interface.
Finally, we discuss the diffusive properties of the mol-
ecules within the ﬁrst two layers. From a force-ﬁeld study35
it was concluded that the molecules in the ﬁrst layer were
immobile. Here, we ﬁnd that while these molecules are slug-
gish with a diffusion coefﬁcient of 0.02 Å2/ps, they are
mobile and the exchange of molecules between the ﬁrst and
second layers is observed; such exchange is consistent with

recent ESD measurements.19 Immediately beyond the ﬁrst
layer, the H2Obr molecules exhibit a diffusion coefﬁcient of
0.07 Å2/ps, which is characteristic of PBE bulk water.36
Thus our calculations predict a large discontinuity in diffu-
sion coefﬁcients upon moving away from the surface rather
than the gradual change predicted previously.35 To under-
stand why the water dynamics can vary on the Angström
length scale, HB lifetimes were computed.34 Whereas the
calculated HB lifetime for PBE bulk water is about 7 ps, the
lifetime for the interlayer HBs is only 0.9 ps, and for the HBs
between the H2Obr molecules and the Obr sites it is also short
at 3.8 ps. Thus, although H2Obr molecules form HBs to both
the H2OTi molecules and the Obr bridge sites, these HBs are
short lived and it is this that enables relatively rapid diffusion
of the molecules in the second layer. This establishes for this
system a clear connection between local bonding and dy-
namics.
In conclusion, an extensive series of ﬁrst-principles simu-
lations for water on TiO2110 have been performed. By
carefully evaluating the sensitivity of the results to slab
thickness and xc functional including the ﬁrst periodic hy-
brid functional calculations for water on TiO2 we have ar-
rived at a consistent picture with regard to water dissocia-
tion: water does not dissociate in the entire coverage regime
examined. This clear understanding has then allowed us to
address other long-standing questions of general importance
relating to the structure and dynamics of the wet TiO2 inter-
face. We ﬁnd that molecules within the liquid ﬁlm adsorb in
at least two distinct layers: those in the ﬁrst layer are slug-
gish and bond strongly to ﬁvefold coordinated Ti sites; those
in the second layer interact weakly with the substrate and
diffuse rapidly. This reveals strongly inhomogeneous dynam-
ics of the interfacial water and shows that in the immediate
vicinity of the interface the dynamical properties of the water
can vary on the Angström length scale. Hydrogen bonding
between the ﬁrst and second layers is observed as well as the
exchange of molecules. In addition, the presence of second
layer molecules causes those in the ﬁrst layer to reorient,
indicating that the monolayer is a model of at best limited
applicability to understanding the aqueous water-TiO2 inter-
face. Not only does this study help to resolve a number of
important debates relating to the molecular level details of
water on TiO2 but it also demonstrates the complex nature of
wetting at a seemingly simple defect-free hydrophilic sur-
face.
