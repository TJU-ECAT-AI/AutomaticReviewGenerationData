Successive reduction steps of CeO, particles by hydrogen between 300 and 1070 K have been followed by 
temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and in situ magnetic measurements on several samples with different 
BET surface areas. The nature of the phases present in cerias reduced between 670 and 1270 K was determined 
by X-ray analysis. Finally, reoxidation by oxygen or air was studied at room temperature for all the reduced 
samples. 
Magnetic and TPR results show a direct relationship between the degree of reduction and the BET surface 
area. Indeed, for most of the samples, the degree of reduction at 620-670 K determined by magnetism corre- 
sponded to the creation of one layer of Ce3+ ions at the surface of the ceria. A similar relationship between the 
BET surface area and the extent of reduction was established using the area of the low-temperature TPR com- 
posite peak, the maximum of which was found to be constant at 810 K. 
When the reduction progresses further into the bulk, two main phases were evidenced: first, an expanded 
cubic CeO,-, 
phase derived from the initial ceria by a dilatation of the whole structure and, for deeply reduced 
samples, the hexagonal C
e

phase. A new intermediate phase, cubic Ce,O,, 
was also observed on samples 
reduced at 1070-1 170 K. 
Complete reoxidation by oxygen occurs at room temperature, for all reduction percentages below ca. 60Â°/,,, 
i.e. as long as the reduced phase remained in the cubic form. When the hexagonal Ce,O, 
phase has been 
formed, the reoxidation cannot be completed at 294 K. 
The structure of ceria is face-centred cubic (fluorite type). It 
can be described as a pile of oxygen ions. linked together by 
the edges, with the cerium atom at the centre o

 the oxygen 
cube in octahedral coordination.

However, in the presence of oxygen. these com- 
pounds are easily reoxidized to the stable CeO, . This oxygen 
lability and the possibility of large deviations from stoichiorn- 
etry explain the prevalent use of ceria in catalysts for auto- 
motive post-combustion. In such systems, cerium oxide 
behaves as an oxygen partial pressure reg~lator.'.~ 
For this 
reason, several studies have appeared which have focussed on 
elucidating the conditions of these redox processes in order 
to obtain a better understanding of their mechanisms.6 '_' 
From these studies, it appears that the texture of the initial 
cerium oxide has a great influence on the interaction between 
H, 
and CeO,. However, any quantitative determination of z 
in the Ce02-, reduced phase cannot be accurate because 
most of the results are obtained from TPR studies which do 
not take into account the reduction of impurities (nitrates. 
carbonates) or hydrogen fixation, all quantities which can be 
important in dispersed cerias. 
l6 The control of the reduction 
extent by oxygen reoxidation is also rarely given. Moreover. 
although the Ce-0 
phase diagram is well established for 
samples prepared at high temperat~re,~ 
there is a lack ol' 
phase determination for the solids obtained by reduction of 
dispersed cerias, which are those used in catalysis. All these 
data are necessary to establish a macroscopic scheme of the 
oxygen transfer in CeO, during reduction-oxidation pro- 
cesses. 
In a recent paper," we have studied, by several comple- 
mentary techniques and particularly by in situ magnetic SUS- 
ceptibility measurements, the hydrogen reduction processes 
of two ceria samples having surface areas of, respectively, 5 
and I15 m' g-' . The reduction began at 470 K, irrespective 
of the initial surface. With the low-surface-area ceria, a small 
reduction plateau at 620 K attributed to the reduction of the 
ceri$i 
surface was observed as well as an intermediate state at 
a higher temperature of reduction (900 K), having the formal 
composition CeO, 8 3 ,  r.e. close to that of Ce,O, ,. 
In the case 
of the 11 
5 m2 g-' sample. the observation of a plateau corre- 
sponding to the reduction of the surface depended on the 
operating conditions, but again a stabilized composition 
close to CeO, g4 could be obtained at 670 K. The reoxidation 
by tixygen of the reduced oxides was almost complete at 
room temperature. 
Ir the present work, we have generalized these studies to 
othcr samples of intermediate surface area and to higher 
reduction extents, in order to see if the same reduction steps 
can be observed for various ceria types and if the reversibility 
of the redox process can be effective whatever the solid and 
redLCtion percentage. In parallel with the quantitative deter- 
mindion of the reduction percentage by TPR and magne- 
tism, the evolution of the ceria structure was followed by 
X-rz y diffraction on samples sealed under hydrogen after 
redLCtion. The results are presented and discussed in terms of 
the topology of the reduction and reoxidation processes. 
together with the structure of the reduced phase.

By treatment of the initial cerias in various conditions, five 
new samples were prepared. All the samples studied are pre- 
sented in Table 1, which also gives the BET surface area and 
the equivalent microporous surface calculated according to 
the 't method'.'' Among the samples, C1-400 and C1-850 
have already been characterized by means of several tech- 
niques. 
In order to compare the samples under the same condi- 
tions, they were standardized with a pretreatment i
n
 situ 
under oxygen flow (4 1 h-') at 673 K for 1 h (heating rate, 
5 K min-I). After that, they were evacuated or placed in an 
inert gas flow for 1 h at 673 K before cooling to room 
temperature. 
Temperature-programmed Reduction (TPR) 
The hydrogen consumption (1% H, in argon) was followed 
with a thermal conductivity detector in an apparatus 
described previously." The catalyst was in a U-shaped 
reactor. The flow rate was 1.1 1 h-' and the heating rate 8 K 
min-'. 
Magnetic Measurements 
The Faraday microbalance and procedure for calculation of 
the magnetic susceptibility have been described else- 
where."." 
The method allows determination of the para- 
magnetic Ce3+ ion content (note that Ce4+ in CeO, is 
diamagnetic). 
The experimental conditions corresponded to those used 
previ0us1y.l~ 
The ceria sample (0.10-0.13 g) was first stan- 
dardized under oxygen at 673 K, and then evacuated down 
to 0.1-0.2 mPa at the same temperature. After cooling to 294 
K, the sample was placed under a hydrogen flow (4 1 h-I) 
and heated (4 K min-') with incremental steps of 50 K. For 
each step, the sample was kept for 2 h at the temperature 
before cooling to 294 K, always in H,, in order to measure 
the susceptibility. The latter was found to be nearly the same 
if the sample was cooled under vacuum instead of hydro- 
gen." 
X-Ray Diffkaction (XRD) 
The X-ray diagrams were obtained using the Debye-Scherrer 
method with Mo-Ka radiation or Cu-Kcr in some cases. Since 
the reduced cerias are extremely sensitive to air reoxidation, a 
special procedure was followed which consisted of sealing the 
reduced sample in a quartz tube under hydrogen partial pres- 
sure. Then, in a glove box flushed with oxygen-free dry argon, 
the sample was transferred into a controlled-atmosphere cell 
equipped with a beryllium window enabling the X-ray dif- 
fraction pattern to be recorded.

Study by TPR 
Three samples were examined for this study and compared 
with C1-400: C2-600, C2-800 and C1-850. After the stan- 
dardization treatment, TPR was performed up to around 
1100 K. 
The curves are shown on Fig. 1. Each curve presents a first 
composite peak beginning at about 500 K with a maximum 
close to 810 K. The shapes of this peak are not identical for 
the different samples. Shoulders and slope changes are visible 
as indicated by the arrows on Fig. 1. Fig. l(b) and (c), relative 
to the same precursor, present a similar initial profile, 
whereas for Fig. l(a), the hydrogen consumption is initially 
rather slow, and then increases quickly between 630 and 
660 K. Another minor slope change is also observed at 760- 
740 K for Fig. l(a) and (b). All these differences have to be 
connected with a specific chemistry of the oxide surface 
anions depending on the sample surface. An attempt has been 
made with FTIR spectroscopy to correlate them with differ- 
ent types of surface hydroxy groups.20 
Nevertheless, although 
the first peak results from several steps, it can be related to a 
global process corresponding to the consumption of the 
surface oxygen species as evidenced bef~re.~~'~' 
Then, after 
this q s t  peak, when the temperature is increased above 900 
K, the beginning of a new peak is observed on the curves and 
must be due to the bulk reduction. 
For C1-400 [Fig. l(a)] the nature and origin of the nega- 
tive peak at 965 K were already characteri~ed.'~*~~ 
This peak 
arises from the reduction of bulk carbonates" which are 
present in the solid and are desorbed under vacuum at 
around 810 K. It can also be due to the desorption of hydro- 
gen fixed by the solid during the TPR.16 For C2-600 [Fig. 
l(b)], the negative peak is not clearly observed or, more prob- 
ably, it occurs at 880 K with a lower intensity, giving rise to 
the small positive peak centred at 965 K. It must be 
remarked that this sample was prereduced at 873 K before 
being reoxidized at room temperature. Such a sample 
exhibited an almost complete absence of carbonate species, as 
shown by FTIR spectroscopy.21 
This absence of carbonates 
must therefore explain the absence of the negative peak at 
890 K. 
Assuming that the first peak is due only to the reduction of 
the various surface oxygen species, it is interesting to note 
that no major shift is observed at the maximum temperature 
of this peak. For every sample, the maximum is observed at

around 810 K. This observation is in disagreement with the 
results of Johnson and  MOO^.^ It indicates that whatever the 
initial texture, the mean binding energies of the surface 
oxygen are the same and distinct from that of the bulk. It can 
also be an indication that the pretreatment procedure at 
673 K was efficient enough to leave the surface in a clean 
reproducible state. 
In order to make a correlation with the BET surface area, 
we calculated the hydrogen uptake during this first peak. 
Two methods were tried. The first one used the experimental 
curve [Table 2 (exp)]. The second one was undertaken in 
order to minimize the uncertainty due to the recovering of

the surface and bulk reduction processes at high temperature 
and also to limit the error caused by the negative peak which 
might be present in each sample. Since it is dificult to decon- 
volute the first peak, we have supposed that the surface 
reduction peak was symmetrical and centred at the maximum 
temperature (see Fig. 1). Thus the hydrogen uptake was cal- 
culated by doubling the H, consumed between 470 and 810 
K, the temperature of the maximum of the low-temperature 
peak. The corresponding hydrogen quantities are certainly 
overestimated compared with the real phenomenon. They are 
presented in Table 2 (sym.). The values of this second series 
are all higher than those of the first ones. Also included in 
this table for comparison are the values predicted according 
to the method proposed by Johnson and  MOO^.' These 
authors assumed a simple model in which the ceria surface is 
constituted by adjacent oxygen ions (ionic radius, 0.14 nm) 
the number of which can be easily calculated for spherical or 
cubic particles. By supposing that the reduction of the surface 
cerium species corresponds to the elimination of one fourth 
of the surface oxygen ions (capping oxide ions), it is easy to 
obtain the corresponding values for hydrogen. 
The relationships between BET surface area and the differ- 
ent hydrogen consumptions are shown graphically in Fig. 2. 
The variations are roughly linear in both cases, which indi- 
cates that the first overall TPR peak may be related directly 
to the reduction of the ceria surface. However, the slopes 
(respectively, 3.1 and 4.2 pmol H, mP2) 
differ by about 35%, 
and are well below the predicted one (almost 5.4 pmol H, 
mP2). 
This difference can be due to a too simplified model. In 
particular, it does not take into account the repartition of the 
crystallographic planes of ceria which may vary when the cal- 
cination temperature increases. Moreover, the value for the 
ionic radius of the oxygen ion could be different. One can 
also think of a specific reason connected with the physico- 
chemistry of the ceria surface or the experimental conditions. 
For example, a too low pressure of hydrogen during the TPR 
could induce a low reduction rate and be in competition with 
simple oxygen depletion (due to both sintering of the ceria 
and the lability of some oxygen species) or a decrease of 
âmobile oxygenâ content due to sintering. Consequently, we

applied the magnetic method to measure the reduction extent 
of the ceria surface with pure hydrogen. 
Magnetic Study 
The reduction percentages estimated from the magnetic sus- 
ceptibilities at 294 K, are shown in Fig. 3 as a function of the 
reduction temperature for six samples of Table 1. The pre- 
vious results for C1-400 and C1-850 are presented again for a 
complete comparison, Further, the run for C-400 was re- 
peated and extended to temperatures higher than 673 K, the 
preparation temperature and the limit of the previous 
study. 
In every case, the beginning of the reduction is observed at 
470 K. Then, as the temperature increases, the reduction 
extent increases, and the more so for higher BET surface 
areas. For all the samples, the curves exhibit an inflexion 
point or even a plateau in the 620-720 K temperature 
domain. It must be recalled that on the curves each experi- 
mental point was obtained after a 2 h isothermal reduction. 
Thus, the different equilibrium points before obtaining the 
reduction plateau value correspond to different germination 
and surface diffusion steps which, in fact, reveal a specific 
surface chemistry depending upon the sample. 
For higher temperatures and in the case of the non- 
microporous solids [Fig. 3(b) and (c)], an important increase 
in reduction extent is obtained at about 800 K. At 900 K, an

intermediate state seems to be reached, corresponding to a 
36-42% reduction percentage, i.e. to cerium oxides having 
the composition CeO,.,,-CeO,.,, 
. For the microporous 
cerias (Cl-400 and C1-700), no real intermediate state was 
evidenced at about 900 K. The curves show a progressive but 
irregular increase, with several slope changes. This behaviour 
can be explained by two main phenomena which probably 
occur simultaneously 
: (i) the elimination of bulk carbonates 
as evidenced by TPR which induces a transient local dis- 
order and (ii) the decrease of the BET surface area which is 
effective on this sample for reduction temperatures higher 
than 720 K.22 
Our previous data on C1-400 and C1-850 have evidenced a 
rough relationship between the reduction extent at 670 K and 
the BET surface area. The values calculated here at the 620- 
720 K plateau for all the samples lead to the almost linear 
relationship shown in Fig. 4, although the C1-400 point is 
clearly above the line. The slope is slightly inferior (15%) to 
the one calculated in the model of Johnson and Mooi. This 
relatively good agreement supports the model which predicts 
at the plateau the elimination of one fourth of the surface 
adjacent oxygen ions. It confirms the idea that for tem- 
peratures G620-670 K, the reduction process is mainly 
limited to the uppermost layer of the ceria. The dispersed 
ceria C1-400 is an exception with a reduction greater than 
one layer, which is probably due to the more dispersed char- 
acter of this oxide for which the cubic model of Johnson and 
Mooi may be very crude. Indeed, the numerous lattice defects 
must be favourable for a faster diffusion of the oxygen species 
in the bulk. It could also be connected with the higher germi- 
nation process rate related to specific surface sites.â 
By comparison, the reduction values obtained by TPR are 
smaller than those deduced from the magnetic study. This 
can be explained by the differences in experimental pro- 
cedures. During magnetic measurements, longer reduction 
times and higher hydrogen pressures favour the equilibrium 
states and a fraction of the bulk oxygen can reach the surface 
and be reduced. In TPR experiments, although the higher 
reduction temperature must favour oxygen diffusion, the 
decrease of the BET area would limit the participation of the 
bulk oxygen. Thus, it seems normal to obtain lower values 
for TPR. Another reason can contribute to the lower TPR

values: The TPR data are calculated on the basis of the 
initial sample weight, i.e. without taking into account the 
weight loss occurring during the standardization treatment. 
This is not the case for magnetism. The difference can be esti- 
mated to about 7% for C1-400 but is much smaller for 
C1-850 with a specific surface area of 5 m2 8-l. 
Therefore, even if it is not possible to obtain a complete 
agreement between the TPR and magnetic results, both sets 
of data are directly related to the BET surface area of the 
initial ceria. Accordingly, these methods can be very useful 
for determining the surface area of peculiar ceria samples, as, 
for example, the supported cerias. The TPR technique is easy 
to handle and commonly utilized in research laboratories, in 
contrast to the magnetic technique. However, the latter has 
the great advantage of selectively measuring the formation of 
Ce3+ ions and gives reliable data, irrespective of the content 
of metallic salts or impurities in the sample, with the excep- 
tion of strongly paramagnetic or ferromagnetic 
species. 
X-Ray Study of the Reduced Phase 
The composition of the oxide obtained after reduction at 
900 K, CeO1.8S1.79, 
is close to that of the monoclinic phase 
Ce6011 (CeOla8J or eventually Ce7O12 (CeO,.,,) which 
have been proposed to explain some diffraction  pattern^.,^.,^ 
The reduced solid could also correspond to a mixture of 
CeO, and Ce203. 
Another important point is the nature of 
the cerium oxide when the reduction is performed at tem- 
peratures >900 K. In order to characterise these points, we 
have studied the evolution of the X-ray diagrams of CeO, 
reduced under pure hydrogen at temperatures up to 1270 K. 
The starting material C1-400, which has the highest BET 
surface area, was chosen to obtain the highest reduction per- 
centage. Additionally, a run was performed with the C1-850 
sample. These samples were heated for 15 h under 3.6 1 h-' 
of hydrogen at fixed temperature, cooled under hydrogen to 
room temperature and analysed as 
noted above. 
Table 3 summarizes the results obtained after reduction at 
673 and 873 K. From the position and the intensity of the 
diffraction peaks, it can be seen that the initial cubic structure 
of CeO, is maintained but with a slight shift of all the lines. 
The cell parameters determined from the set of interplanar 
spacings are 5.433 and 5.509 A, for the Cl-400 samples 
reduced at 673 and 873 K, respectively. 
This corresponds to a 
lattice expansion of the ceria of 0.4% for the sample reduced 
at 673 K 
and of 1.8% for the sample reduced at 873 K. No 
evidence for the Ce6011 
phase was found. In particular, the 
(043) Bragg line with spacing d = 
2.447 A, characteristic of 
the Ce6011 
phase, is absent on all the patterns. The results 
are similar after reduction at 873 K of the low-surface-area 
sample C1-850. In this case, the interplanar spacing is 
5.502 A, with an expansion of 1.7%. 
The X-ray diffraction pattern corresponding to the 
reduction temperature of 1073 K is shown on Fig. 5(4. In 
addition to the peaks of the expanded CeO, phase (cell 
parameter 5.564 A, lattice expansion 2.8%), new well defined 
peaks appear with low intensity (Table 4). No referenced 
JCPDS-ICDD phase could be attributed to these peaks 
which could correspond to a cubic structure. 
The diffractograms 
of the solids reduced at 1173 [Fig. qa)] 
and 1273 K [Fig. qb)] are more complex. The expanded

phase is always present (cell parameter 5.555 and 5.520 
A, lattice expansion 2.7 and 2.0% for 1173 and 1273 K, 
respectively) and all the peaks of the Ce,03 phase are 
observed. After reduction at 1273 K, the concentration of the 
CezOJ 
phase increases at the expense of the expanded ceria. 
It must be stressed that the unknown cubic phase evidenced

on the high-angle side. They can be attributed to the normal 
cerium dioxide. This beginning of reoxidation was due to a 
tiny air leak in the measurement cell, as could be deduced 
from the evolution of the spectrum with time. 
The increase of the lattice parameter was previously noted 
by Bauer and Gingerich,' and also by Ray et 
This 
lattice expansion is due to the reduction of some Ce4+ ions 
to Ce3+, 
the radius of the Ce3+ ion being larger than that of 
Ce4+ (128.3 pm instead of 111 pm26). 
However, this increase 
was associated with the splitting of some peaks suggesting a 
rhombohedra1 symmetry. Here, no such splitting was 
observed. The structure remains unchanged and the unit cell 
varies with the reduction temperature, as shown on Fig. 7. A 
slight expansion is already detected after reduction at 673 K, 
but cannot be considered as certain. Then, the increase is 
evident and reaches a maximum for 1100 K. For higher 
reduction temperatures, the lattice expansion decreases, prob- 
ably because Ce3+ ions begin to leave the expanded CeO, 
phase to form the Ce203 
phase. 
The new cubic phase can be tentatively assigned. As shown 
in Fig. 8 and Table 4, it seems to present some links with the

tures most commonly found for rare-earth-metal sesquiox-

also been recorded. In cases where M,O, crystallizes with 
more than one structure, A appears to be stable at the highest 
temperature, B at lower and C at the lowest temperatures. 
The hexagonal A and cubic C forms are known for lantha- 
num (JCPDS-ICDD 05-0602 and 22-0369, respectively), but 
only the A hexagonal form is reported for cerium to our 
knowledge (JCPDS-ICDD 23-1048). The cubic C structure is 
closely related to that of CaF, from which it may be derived 
by removing one quarter of the anions and then rearranging 
the atoms slightly.26 
It is interesting to recall that the cerium

cubic structure is assumed for our unknown cerium phase, a 
value of 1113 pm for the unit-cell parameter can be deter- 
mined from the interplanar spacings of Table 4. This value

facts could be important for the redox processes occurring in 
the three-way catalytic converters during the rich and lean- 
burn steps. 
Discussion 
The influence of the surface area on the reduction of ceria by 
hydrogen has been observed previ~usly.~~â*â 
â 
The present 
results give more quantitative information and allow charac- 
terisation of several points during the reduction processes. 
When the reduction is performed by isothermal steps, we 
have evidenced a plateau for the Ce3+ content between 620 
and 720 K, as seen in the magnetic susceptibility data. An 
almost linear relationship was found between the degree of 
reduction calculated at this plateau and the initial BET 
surface area. The corresponding slope is very close to that 
which can be predicted assuming a compact model of 
capping oxygen ions, with one fourth of these ions eliminated 
upon reduction. From this result, we have concluded that the 
first reduction step corresponds to that of the surface alone. 
The TPR results confirm this conclusion. Two main 
reduction processes by hydrogen were observed. They corre- 
spond, respectively, to the surface and bulk oxygen reduction. 
The corresponding binding energies of these oxygen species 
in the solid are different enough to lead to well separated 
phenomena during the reduction. This model is supported by 
the fact that whatever the initial surface area of the ceria 
sample, the temperature of the maximum of the first peak 
remains constant, at about 810 K. An examination of the 
small shoulders in the first composite TPR peak has shown 
that the surface reduction is, in fact, more complex and 
involves the reduction of different surface species, the popu- 
lation of which may vary from one oxide to another. Thus, 
the initial reduction process results from germination and 
surface diffusion steps, which progressively involves the whole 
surface. This model of reduction corresponds to a cherry-like 
attack scheme where after the completion of the surface 
reduction, the following step is the bulk reduction at higher 
temperatures. 
One can deduce from our results that the oxygen ion 
mobility in the bulk is low as long as the initial lattice of 
CeO, remains non-expanded. In this general scheme, the 
changes, with texture, of the surface oxygen binding energy 
distributions are probably limited and do not affect the TPR 
results. This conclusion is important in the study of modified 
ceria samples. As noted above, any change observed in the 
position and the shape of the first TPR peak will be directly 
attributed to the modification of the chemistry of the ceria 
surface. This is the case in the presence of anionic species 
(after impregnation),28 residual 
or doping ele- 
ments in the bulk. Such modifications are also well known 
when a metal is present on the ceria surface, for which much 
lower temperatures are observed for the reduction of the 
surface.Q. 
18.29.30 
A calculation by two methods of the number of surface 
oxygen ions using the first TPR peak was presented above. 
The values are lower than that obtained by magnetic mea- 
surements or with the m0de1.~ The numerous parameters 
which influence the validity of the TPR results have been 
already discussed in detail.16 Another question must also be 
considered. Indeed, we have observed in the case of highly 
dispersed cerias that an important sintering occurred after a 
partial reduction, as soon as the treatment temperature is 
higher than 720 K2â As the maximum of the TPR curve is 
located at 810 K, it is quite probable that, under hydrogen 
and at this temperature, the actual surface of the catalyst is 
lower than the initial one. Under these conditions, the quan- 
tity of hydrogen calculated from TPR for highly dispersed 
samples may be systematically lower. For low surface areas, 
this phenomenon is probably limited, but the precision of the 
measurement is poor because the deconvolution of the peaks 
is difficult and no clear conclusion can be established. 
However, in spite of these limitations, it remains that both 
the TPR and magnetic results of Fig. 2 and 4 can be usefully 
applied to estimate the initial surface area of an unknown 
ceria sample. 
The case of the highly dispersed ceria C1-400 was found by 
magnetic analysis to be unusual. The degree of reduction 
observed at the plateau was higher than expected from Fig. 4. 
As already noted, this may be caused by a higher germination 
rate and diffusion processes. It could also indicate that the 
energy required for bulk diffusion is lower in the case of high- 
surface-area ceria; this seems plausible in view of the defects 
in dispersed solids. This effect could also be due to the 
reduction and the elimination of the inner polycarbonate 
species which may be already effective at this temperature 
and would deeply modify the top surface layers.â 
Although the magnetic method shows some stable inter- 
mediate compositions during the reduction (Fig. 3), no evi- 
dence of a definite suboxide phase was obtained. For 
moderate reduction percentages, there is only one phase 
observed by X-ray diffraction which has the expanded cubic 
structure of CeO, . 
No evidence for an initial ceria phase was 
found, as could have been the case if the bulk reduction had 
progressed by zones. This suggests that as soon as the 
expanded ceria is obtained, the mobility of the oxygen ions 
becomes high in the lattice. This is very well illustrated by the 
facile reoxidation of such samples upon introduction of 
oxygen at room temperature. 
When the reduction extent is increased, the hexagonal 
Ce,O, phase is nucleated, with the intermediary formation of 
a cubic Ce203 
phase. The hexagonal lattice of Ce203 
is more 
stable. It presents many fewer anionic vacancies than the 
expanded cubic lattice of CeO, - 
x .  Consequently, the diffu- 
sion of oxygen ions will need a much higher activation energy 
and the reoxidation process will not be completed at room 
temperature as soon as the hexagonal Ce,O, 
phase is 
formed. This fact could be of some importance in the three- 
way catalysts in which the gas composition changes with high 
frequency (0.5-5 Hz), as soon as the redox processes are not 
limited to the surface. 
Conclusions 
The interaction of hydrogen with cerias of different surface 
areas was followed by TPR, i
n
 situ magnetic susceptibility 
measurements and X-ray diffraction.

By the magnetic method, a stable reduced state is found 
between 620 and 720 K. The degree of reduction obtained at 
this plateau varies linearly with the BET surface area. The 
corresponding slope is very close to that which can be calcu- 
lated assuming a compact model of capping oxygen ions with 
one fourth of the surface ions eliminated upon reduction. It is 
concluded that the formation of one Ce3+ ion layer on the 
surface corresponds to a stable intermediate state. The TPR 
data confirm this conclusion. Although the agreement with 
the predicted value is poor, a linear relationship could be 
obtained between the BET surface area and the hydrogen 
consumption during the low-temperature reduction compos- 
ite peak. These results open the possibility of determining the 
contribution of the ceria surface in some complex systems 
containing cerium dioxide. 
For temperatures between 720 K and about 900 K, which 
correspond to reduction extents probably lower than 50- 
60%, the bulk reduction preserves the initial structure of the 
cubic ceria but an appreciable expansion of the lattice is 
observed. Under these conditions, complete reoxidation can 
be effective at room temperature. For higher reduction per- 
centages, the hexagonal Ce203 
phase is formed and its pres- 
ence decreases the reversibility of the redox process since 
most of the Ce,O, phase remains stable under air at room 
temperature. Finally, a new intermediate phase, cubic Ce203, 
was observed on the ceria samples reduced at 1070-1 170 K.
