Abstract
We use density functional theory to study the properties of low index flat faces (i.e., not having steps) of lanthanum oxychloride LaOCl. We calculate the surface energies and the energies to make oxygen and chlorine vacancies on the surface by producing 1/2O2 or 1/2Cl2 in the gas phase. We find that the electrons left behind when the vacancies are formed are localized at the vacancy site, making these sites very reactive with electrophiles. It is also possible to make Cl vacancies by a spillover process (a Cl atom leaves its lattice site to move onto the surface) but these vacancies are not chemically active. We show that p-doping, with dopants having lower valence than La, will facilitate oxygen or chlorine vacancy formation.

1 Introduction
Lanthanum oxychloride, LaOCl, is involved in the catalytic oxychlorination of methane to CH3Cl, (1-3) in the low temperature, catalytic destruction of chlorinated methane derivatives and in the dehydrochlorination of halogenated ethane to vinyl chloride. (4-9) The chlorination of methane is a possible route for methane activation and conversion to high value chemicals. Current methods for disposing of unwanted chlorinated hydrocarbons involve burning at very high temperature and a low temperature route is therefore desirable. Vinyl chloride is the monomer for polyvinyl chloride, the polymer produced in largest amounts after polyethylene.
In the papers mentioned above, the catalyst surface is exposed to chlorine source (HCl or a halogenated alkane) and oxygen. The presence of the chlorine source provides the driving force to convert La2O3 to LaOCl and then to LaCl3. The presence of the oxygen provides the driving force for converting LaCl3 to LaOCl and subsequently into La2O3. When the surface is exposed simultaneously to a halogen source and oxygen, it will reach a steady state in which the surface composition will consist of a mixture of Cl and O atom (and, of course, La). The O to Cl ratio will depend on the partial pressure of the oxygen and chlorine source and the temperature. The catalyst in the above processes is a LaOxCly surface layer.
In this paper, we use density functional theory to examine some of the chemical properties of lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) surfaces, which we consider to be an idealized model of a halogenated catalyst surface. The methodology used in the calculations is described in section . Previous calculations (3, 6, 8) examined only the (001) face, which is the largest face in the crystallite. We examine the (001), (101), (100), (111) and (110) faces because their structure is different and therefore they may have different reactivity. In Section , we give the calculated surface energies of these faces.
Section presents the energy to remove a Cl atom from the surface to make 1/2Cl2 in gas phase and a chlorine vacancy. In section we calculate the energy to pull a Cl atom from the surface and adsorb it on another surface site. We call this a spillover effect.
Section presents similar results for oxygen. In addition, we examine the energy of oxygen vacancy formation by desorption of OCl from the surface or by the reaction of an adsorbed oxygen atom with a surface oxygen atom to form an O2 molecule in gas. We show that these processes require too much energy to be observed in experiments. It is however probable, on one of the faces, that the oxygen and chlorine atoms on the surface exchange places.
Section examines the projected density of states (PDOS) of various faces of LaOCl with or without defects (vacancies or spillover). The PDOS when an Cl or an O vacancy is present on LaOCl surfaces are shown in sections and . Making a Cl vacancy leaves behind an unpaired electron, which used to be engaged in the bond of the removed atom with the surface. We find that for all faces, except (111), this electron occupies an orbital that is localized at the vacancy site and whose energy is in the band gap. When a Cl vacancy is made on the (111) face, the unpaired electron ends up at the bottom of the conduction band.
Making an oxygen vacancy leaves behind two unpaired electrons occupying orbitals localized around the vacancy and with the energy in the band gap. In this case too, the (111) face is different and the two unpaired electrons are in the conduction band.
The analysis of the density of states shows that the Cl vacancy formed by a Cl spillover is very different from the one formed by removing Cl from the surface. In the case of the spillover, there is no unpaired electron in the vacancy; the electron is used by the Cl atom to form its bond with the surface. The vacancy formed by removing Cl will react with electrophilic compounds, while the one formed by spillover will not.
Section examines the energy of Cl and O vacancy formation in the case when the solid has an additional electron or it misses an electron. This simulates the effect of dopants that are charge donors or acceptors. (10-12) We find that the presence of a hole greatly decreases the energy of vacancy formation, while the presence of an extra electron has a minor effect. This suggests that dopants that create an electron deficit in the system (e.g., Mg, Zn, Na) will lower substantially the energy of vacancy formation. We found this to be true (13) for doped La2O3 and it is very likely to be true for LaOCl.
2 Computational Details
2.1 The DFT Method
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed with the VASP program (14-17) with the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. (18) The ionic cores were described by projected augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials. (19, 20) allowing 11, 6, and 7 valence electrons for La, O, and Cl atoms, respectively. The energy cutoff for the plane wave expansion was 409 eV. Relativistic effects were partially taken into account through relativistic scalar pseudopotentials. The effect of spin–orbit coupling was ignored.
The number of unpaired electrons (Ns) was fixed during geometry optimization. We used Ns equal to zero or two when the number of electrons was even and Ns equal to one or three otherwise. We have performed spin-restricted calculations when Ns is zero, and performed spin-polarized calculations otherwise. We report here only the results for those values of Ns that give the lowest energy.
2.2 Determination of the LaOCl Bulk Crystal Structure
The LaOCl crystal structure was determined by performing an automatic relaxation of the cell shape and volume. The positions of the atoms were varied, by using quasi-Newton optimization, until all components of the forces acting on the atoms were smaller than 0.01 eV/Å. No symmetry was imposed during the optimization procedure. The Brillouin zone was sampled using an automatically generated 9 × 9 × 5 Monkhorst–Pack mesh (21) giving a total of 203 irreducible k-points. The convergence criterion was 10–5 eV for the self-consistent electronic minimization. Fractional occupancies of the bands were allowed using a window of 0.05 eV and the Gaussian smearing method.
The LaOCl crystal belongs to the tetragonal space group P4/nmm. The unit cell (see Figure 1a) contains two LaOCl units. La, Cl, and O occupy sites 2(c), 2(c), and 2(a) located at (1/4,1/4, zLa), (1/4, 1/4, zCl), and (3/4, 1/4, 0), respectively. The structure of LaOCl consists of a LaO layer sandwiched between two Cl layers.

A comparison between the calculated and measured (22, 23) structural parameters is provided in Table 1 in the Supporting Information. The unit cell dimensions obtained with PBE (a = 4.110 Å and c = 6.897 Å) are within 0.3% of the experimental values. Differences less than 0.03% are observed between the calculated and measured z-component of the fractional coordinates of the La and Cl atoms (zLa and zCl). The largest difference between experiments and theory for the bond lengths is 0.2%. The structure of the LaOCl crystal is well reproduced by DFT calculations.
2.3 Characterization of the LaOCl Surfaces
LaOCl surfaces were studied using a slab consisting of periodically repeated supercells, which are shown in Figures 2–6. An empty space of 15 Å is inserted between the slab and its periodic replica in direction perpendicular to the surface. The electrostatic interaction between the slab and its periodic images in the direction perpendicular to the surface was canceled by applying monopole, dipole and quadrupole corrections to the energy, using a modified version of the method proposed by Makov and Payne. (24) We included a Harris–Foulkes correction when we calculated forces. The Kohn–Sham matrix was diagonalized iteratively using a Davidson block iteration scheme. The convergence criterion was 10–4 eV for the self-consistent electronic minimization. Structural optimization was stopped when all components of the atomic forces were smaller than 0.02 eV/Å. Fractional occupancies of the bands were allowed using a window of 0.05 eV and the Gaussian smearing method. Different k-meshes were used depending on the surface and on the calculated properties.

The surface energy (Es) is obtained using:
Here, Eslab is the total energy of a completely relaxed [1 × 1] slab, n is the number of La2O2Cl2 units in the slab, and Ebulk is the total energy of the bulk having one unit cell (i.e., one La2O2Cl2 unit). SA is the area of the two faces of the supercell taken to be planar. This definition is good for flat surfaces but it underestimates the real area of the corrugated (101), (011), and (111) faces.
The vacancy formation energy (Evf[X]) is the energy needed for removing one atom (X is either O or Cl) from the surface to form 1/2X2 in the gas-phase. Evf[X] is calculated with:
Here, X stands for O or Cl, E[X2] is the total energy of O2 or Cl2 in gas-phase, E[LaOCl(S)] is the total energy of the stoichiometric slab, and E[LaOCl(D)] is the total energy of a relaxed, defective LaOCl slab having one O-vacancy or one Cl-vacancy in the surface of the supercell.
The spillover energy (Espill) corresponds to the energy needed for removing one atom from its equilibrium position in the top surface layer of the stoichiometric slab (creating a vacancy) and putting it on the surface site for which the atom has the largest binding energy. The spillover energy is similar to the vacancy formation energy except that the removed atom is bound to the surface instead of desorbing from it as half a diatomic molecule. Espill[X] is calculated using:
Here, X stands for O or Cl, E[LaOCl(S)] is the total energy of the stoichiometric surface, E[X/LaOCl(D)] is the total energy of a relaxed LaOCl surface having one O or Cl vacancy per supercell and one O or one Cl atom adsorbed at the surface site where it has the highest binding energy.
3 The Surface Energy of the Clean Stoichiometric Surfaces
We impose two conditions on the slab used for calculating the surface energies of various crystal faces. 1) The slab must contain an integer number of La2O2Cl2 units, to have the same stoichiometry as the crystal, and 2) the two surfaces of the slab must have the same structure so that the slab is not polar. These conditions leave only one way of cutting the bulk to form the crystal faces considered here. We have restricted ourselves to the planes with low indices.
We have studied the crystal faces shown in Figures 2–6. Because of the symmetry along the [100] and [010] directions (see Figure 1a), the (010) face is identical with (100), and the (011) face is identical with (101). The manner in which these faces will appear in a crystallite is shown in parts b and c of Figure 1. The (110) and the (100) surfaces were not observed in experiments. (22)
The surface energies Es obtained for slabs composed of 9 stoichiometric layers are given in Table 1. Tests were performed to ensure that the values of Es are converged with respect to the number of stoichiometric layers and the number of k-points. The values of Es reported in Table 1 are converged within 0.002 J/m2 for all surfaces. Increasing the number of k-points and number of layers causes a variation of less than 2%.

aK-mesh indicates the number of subdivisions of the Brillouin zone along each lattice vectors for automatic generation of the Monkhorst–Pack meshes. (21) The total number of irreducible k-points for each mesh is indicated between parentheses. The results were obtained with the PBE functional and the PAW pseudopotential using one unit cell along the x̂ and ŷ directions and slabs composed of 9 stoichiometric layers. All the structures are singlets (Ns = 0). The surfaces are shown in Figures 2–6.
We find large differences between the values of Es of various faces. The (001) face has the lowest energy (Es= 0.099 J/m2) and the (110) the largest (Es = 0.819 J/m2). The surface energy increases in the following order: (001) < (101) = (011) < (100) = (010) < (111) < (110).
We do not know experimental values for surface energy but we can use the calculated surface energies and the Gibbs–Wulff construction (25, 26) to determine the shape of a LaOCl crystal and compare it to the measured shape. (22) The LaOCl crystallite described by Maslen et al. (22) has two (001), four (101) and eight (111) faces whose centers are located, respectively, at 3.6, 12.5, 12.5, and 16.2 μ from the center of the crystallite. According to the Gibbs–Wulff theorem, these distances imply that the surface energy of various faces increase in the following order: (001) < (101) = (011) < (111). This is in agreement with the trend found in our calculations. However, this correlation may be fortuitous. The experiments measured the shape of crystallites exposed to atmosphere and it is very likely that their surface was contaminated. This contamination and the presence of steps and defects (e.g., Cl or O vacancies) affect surface energy and the measured crystallite shape in a way that we cannot determine. Such effects are not included in our calculations.
It has been the tendency in surface science to study the properties of the face that has the lowest surface energy, in the belief that because this has the largest area it is likely to be the most important in catalysis. It is not clear that this reasoning is correct. If catalytic activity is structure dependent, then different faces should have different reactivities. It is possible that a high surface energy indicates a high reactivity, and such a face contribute more to product formation than a less active face that has a bigger area. A dramatic example of this situation is provided by the MoS2 crystallites whose face with largest area is inactive. (27)
4 The Formation of Chlorine Vacancies
4.1 Chlorine Vacancy Formation by Desorbing Cl2 from the Surface
Lercher and co-workers (2, 3, 28) have studied the oxychlorination reaction 2CH4 + 2HCl + 1/2O2 = 2CH3Cl + H2O catalyzed by either LaCl3 or LaOCl or LaO3. These materials have the same catalytic activity, if they are given time to reach steady state under reaction conditions. The reaction takes place through a Mars–van Krevelen like mechanism, in which the halogen that goes into CH3Cl originates from the surface; the role of HCl is to replenish the halogen removed from the surface by the desorption of CH3Cl. Making a halogen vacancy is therefore an important step in the reaction mechanism. This means that the energy of halogen-vacancy formation is a descriptor of the reactivity, for oxyhalogenation, of different faces of LaOCl. A face from which it is easier to remove a Cl atom (to form 1/2Cl2 in gas) is more active for oxychlorination.
Because of the large size of the supercell needed for calculating the energy of vacancy formation, the Brillouin zone was sampled at the Γ point only. Increasing the number of irreducible k-points to two, by using a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack mesh, (21) affects the vacancy formation energies by less than 0.05 eV (less than 1%), which we consider negligible. The distances between a vacancy site and its periodic images are 12.33 Å on the (001), (100), and (101) surfaces, 11.63 Å on the (110) surface, and 16.06 Å on the (111) surface. These large distances should minimize the vacancy–vacancy interaction. For the LaOCl(001) surface, increasing the size of the supercell from a [3 × 3] to a [4 × 4] supercell changes the Cl and O vacancy formation energy by 0.05 eV at most. The lowest energy structures of the slabs with a Cl vacancy have one unpaired electron (Ns = 1).
Except for the (110) surface, two kinds of Cl atom are present in the top stoichiometric layer (see Figures 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b, and 6b). We refer to them as the upper and the lower Cl, meaning closer or further from the vacuum, respectively.
Removing one Cl atom in the top stoichiometric layer of the surfaces shown in Figures 2–6 results in the following Cl vacancy coverage: 0.11 monolayer (ML) for the (001) surface, 0.17 ML for the (100), (101), and (111) surfaces, and 0.25 ML for the (110) surface. Here, a monolayer refers to the total number of Cl atoms in the layer from which the atom was removed. For example, there are nine upper Cl atoms in the top stoichiometric layer of the unit cell for the (001) surface (see Figure 2(b)]. Removing one of these Cl atoms corresponds to a vacancy concentration of 1/9 = 0.11 ML.
The lower Cl vacancy on the (001) surface cannot be seen in the top view of the surface (see Figure 2a) and it is not accessible to a gas phase molecule. This is not the case for the (100), (101), and (111) surfaces (see the top view of the surfaces shown in Figures 3a, 4a, and 6a). The (111) surface is more open than the (100) surface and the lower Cl atom in the (111) face is more accessible to a gas phase molecule.
For some oxides the calculated vacancy formation energies depend on the slab thickness. A dramatic example is the rutile TiO2(110) surface (29-33) for which the energy to form an oxygen vacancy at the surface varies with the number of layers used in the calculations and the number of layers allowed to relax. In the worse case this variation is as large as 0.84 eV (corresponding to a 30% deviation). (29, 30) Because of this we have tested how the Cl-vacancy formation energy depends on the slab thickness and the number of oxichloride layers that are allowed to relax (i.e., they are not kept in the bulk-positions). The results of these tests are given in Table S2 in the Supporting Information. Using four stoichiometric layers and allowing three of them to relax lead to converged results (the change in the vacancy formation energy when adding one extra layer is small). The only exception is the (111) surface where the change between the best calculation (four layers with three layers relaxing) and the next best calculation is fairly substantial (i.e., 0.28 eV or 9.2%). Adding a fifth stoichiometric layer to test whether the 2.76 eV value for the (111) surface is converged exceeds the scope of this paper.
The problem observed for the LaOCl(111) surface is not corrected by the inclusion of the on-site correction (34) by using the PBE + U functional or by the inclusion of 25% of the exact DFT exchange by using an hybrid functional. The upper and lower Cl vacancy formation energies obtained for a [3 × 2] supercell and a the slab composed of two stoichiometric layers decrease by less than 0.08 eV when the on-site correction is applied to the 5d electrons of the La atoms (we used the values of the parameter Ueff ranging from 0.5 to 9.5 eV in increments of 1 eV). The Cl vacancy formation energies increase by about 0.2 eV when the hybrid-PBE functional (HSE06) (35-37) is used. We speculate that the larger difference observed with the HSE06 functional is related to the smaller supercell used (a [2 × 2]instead of a [3 × 2]).
The converged results (see above) for the energy of Cl-vacancy formation are given in Table 2. It is curious that for all faces it takes less energy to make a lower vacancy than an upper vacancy.

aThe structures formed by Cl spillover are singlets (Ns = 0) and those formed by desorption of 1/2Cl2 are doublets (Ns = 1). The results were obtained with the PBE functional and the PAW pseudopotential.
There is no correlation between the surface energy and the energy of Cl vacancy formation in either the upper or the lower chlorine layer.
Table 2 shows that Evf[Cl(upper)] increases in the following order: 2.9 eV for the (111) face <3.9 eV for (110) < 4.2 eV [for (001), (100), or (101)] and Evf[Cl(lower)] varies from 2.8 eV for (111), to 3.9 eV [for (001), (100), and (101)], to 4.0 eV (101). We postulate that the chlorine atoms in (111) surface are the most reactive and that, on this face, the Cl atoms in the lower surface layer are more reactive than the ones in the upper layer.
4.2 Chlorine Vacancy Formation by Chlorine Spillover
In this section, we examine the formation of Cl vacancies by removing a Cl atom from its equilibrium position and adsorbing it on the surface of the slab. The location where the Cl atom is adsorbed is the one that gives the system the lowest energy. We call the energy of this vacancy-creating process the Cl-spillover energy (Espill[Cl]). When calculating this quantity we used slabs composed of two stoichiometric layers and we fixed the position of the atoms in the bottom stoichiometric layer. We have not tested the convergence of these energies with respect to the slab size and the number of layers allowed to relax. Judging form the convergence test performed for the “ordinary” Cl vacancies, we conjecture that the results for the spillover energy are converged, except perhaps for the (111) surface. We are most interested in determining whether the spillover is competitive with the normal vacancy formation and in determining whether the Cl-vacancies formed by spillover behave similarly to those formed by desorption of 1/2Cl2.
All spillover energies are positive (see Table 2) indicating that the process is endoergic. The lowest values of Espill[Cl] are obtained for the displacement of a lower Cl atom on the (100) surface or an upper Cl atom on the (110) surface. The largest values are observed for the (001) surface. These values indicate that, at the temperatures for which LaOCl is used as a catalyst, spillover may produce Cl vacancies and Cl atoms adsorbed on the surface. In section , we show that the vacancies made by spillover are not as reactive as the ordinary Cl vacancies.

aNs is the number of unpaired spins in the reduced structure. The results were obtained with the PBE functional, the PAW pseudopotential. See Figures 2–6 for the supercells used in calculations.
5 The Formation of Oxygen Vacancies
5.1 Oxygen Vacancy Formation by Desorbing 1/2O2 from the Surface
The energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy has been used as a descriptor of the propensity of an oxide to engage in an oxidation reaction with a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. The smaller the energy to form an oxygen vacancy on an oxide surface the better oxidant the surface is. (38-40) It is for this reason that we are interested in the energy of oxygen vacancy formation on the oxychloride surface.
Table 3 gives the energy of oxygen–vacancy formation for the faces of the LaOCl crystal shown in Figures 2–6. We consider only the removal of the oxygen atoms from the oxygen layer closest to the vacuum. The dependence of these energies on the number of layers in the slab and the number of layers with fixed geometry is given in Table S3 of the Supporting Information. We report here results for four stoichiometric layers with the atoms in the bottom layer fixed in the positions they have in the bulk oxychloride.
The lowest energy structures of the (001), (100), and (101) faces that have an oxygen – vacancy on them, are singlets (Ns = 0), while the lowest energy of the (111) face having an oxygen–vacancy on it, is a triplet (Ns = 2). The spin state preferred by the defective (110) surface depends on the number of fixed layer during geometry optimization (see Table S3 in the Supporting Information). The singlet is more stable when the maximum number of layers are allowed to relax. However the difference between the energies of singlet and the triplet is 0.06 eV, which is less than the error of the DFT method.
Evf[O] increases in the following order: 4.9 eV (111) < 5.6 eV (110) < 6.4 eV [(001) and (101)] < 6.5 eV (100). This trend is similar to that reported for the creation of the upper Cl vacancy. The energy required to form O-vacancies is higher than that needed for forming Cl-vacancies by about ∼2 eV. We conjecture that, when involved in a Mars–van Krevelen process, the (111) surface is the best oxidant and the best chlorination agent, and (100) is the least active.
The fact that it is easier to make Cl vacancies than oxygen vacancies is consistent with experiments performed in Lercher’s group (2, 3, 28) regarding the reaction CH4 + HCl + 1/2 O2 = CH3Cl + H2O. The Cl atom in CH3Cl originates from the surface, while the O atom in water originates from the gas phase oxygen.
5.2 The Energy To Exchange a Surface Oxygen Atom with a Surface Chlorine Atom
Our calculations show that oxygen spillover is unlikely to occur because it requires very large energies. We have found however that it is possible to exchange the position of an oxygen atom with that of a chlorine atom. The energies of this process obtained using a slab composed of two stoichiometric layers are given in Table 3. Note the substantial dependence on the face: 3.68 eV for (001) and 0.40 eV for (110). At the temperatures where the oxychlorination is performed we expect to have a reasonable probability for such an exchange on all faces, except (001). Therefore, there will be some compositional disorder on some of these faces.
5.3 O Vacancy Formation by Adsorbed Atomic Oxygen
At sufficiently high temperature, the oxygen atoms in the bulk of the oxychloride are mobile, mainly due to the presence of bulk oxygen vacancies. It is therefore possible that some O atoms can travel to the surface and react with an O atom to form O2, which desorbs leaving behind an oxygen vacancy. On the (101) and (111) surfaces the O adatom prefers to binds to a surface O atom forming a two-atom complex that is very similar to an O2 molecule (one could regard this to be an O2 molecule adsorbed at an oxygen-vacancy site). It takes 6.2 eV to desorb this O2 complex from the (101) surface and 4.7 eV to desorb it from the (111) surface. An oxygen atom can also bind to a Cl atom forming a “diatomic” that is very similar to a OCl molecule (one could regard this as an OCl molecule bound at the site of a Cl vacancy). The binding energy of O to a surface-chlorine atom is smaller than the binding energy of O to a surface–oxygen atom. The energy required to remove this OCl complex from the surface, to form an OCl molecule in the gas phase and a chlorine vacancy, is 5.1 eV, for the (101) face, and 3.6 eV, for the (111) face.
These results suggest that oxygen diffusion from the bulk or from step edges may play a role in the creation of O and Cl vacancies on flat surfaces, because the energies required by these processes are lower than those to form a vacancy and 1/2O2 in the gas.
6 The Electronic Structure of the Clean Stoichiometric Surfaces
6.1 The Electronic Structure of Stoichiometric LaOCl
Figure 7 shows the total density of states (DOS) and the site-projected DOS (PDOS) of the clean, stoichiometric LaOCl surfaces. The PDOS is obtained by projecting each Kohn–Sham eigenstate onto spherical harmonics centered on the atom of interest. The radius used in the projection are automatically determined by the VASP program.
Figure 7
Figure 7. Total and site-projected density of states (DOS) of the clean stoichiometric LaOCl surfaces. The position of the Fermi energy for each surface is indicated by a green dashed vertical line. The analysis has been performed at the Γ point using the PBE functional, the PAW pseudopotential, and slabs composed of two stoichiometric layers. The supercells are shown in Figures 2–6.
In Figure 7 and on other similar plots that follow, the valence band is on the left-hand side and is dominated by the orbitals of O and Cl atoms. The top of the valence band has mostly O 2p-character for all faces. The conduction band is shown in the right-hand side of the figure and is dominated by the orbitals of the La atoms. The orbital energies have been shifted so that the Fermi energy equals the negative of the work function of the surface (i.e., the Fermi energy is given relative to the vacuum level). This allows us to compare different surfaces.
The position and the shape of the conduction and the valence bands depend on the surface termination. As a consequence, the Fermi energy and the band gap differ for each surfaces. The Fermi energy increases in the following order: 4.6 eV (111) < 5.2 eV (100) < 5.4 eV (110) < 6.5 eV (101) < 7.0 eV (001). The energy difference between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied Kohn–Sham eigenstates increases from 2.4 eV [(110) and (111)], to 3.5 eV (100), to 4.0 eV (101), to 4.3 eV (001). This is not a good estimate of the band gap and, at best, it might suggest a trend in the correct band gaps.
We note that the large difference in the work functions of different faces implies the existence of a large, compensating electrostatic voltage difference between them. If such a field was not present one could create a perpetual motion machine by removing an electron into the vacuum from a face with low work function and putting it back in the crystal through a face with high work function. In each such circle one gains the energy difference between the high and the low work functions. Such a violation of thermodynamics is prevented by the electrostatic potential difference that must exist between the faces so that work must be done when moving the electron, through the vacuum, from the low work function face to the one with a high work function.
6.2 The PDOS of the Defective Surface Formed by Removal of a Cl Atom
Figure 8a shows the total and site projected DOS of the reduced LaOCl surface having an upper Cl vacancy (the Cl atom has been desorbed as 1/2Cl2). The plots associated with surfaces having a lower Cl vacancy are similar.
Figure 8
Figure 8. (a) Total and site-projected density of states (DOS) of the LaOCl surfaces having one upper Cl vacancy. Starting from the top, the surfaces appear in the following order: (001), (100), (101), (110), and (111). The position of the Fermi energy for each surface is indicated by a green dashed vertical line. (b) Density plot of the eigenstate located in the band gap and localized around the upper Cl vacancy on a LaOCl(001) surface. (c) Density plot of the an eigenstate located at the minimum of the conduction band of a LaOCl(111) surface with an upper Cl vacancy. Density plots show equal density surfaces of 0.01 e/Å3. The analysis was performed at the Γ point using the PBE functional, the PAW pseudopotential, and slabs composed of two stoichiometric layers. The supercells are shown in Figures 2–6.
In contrast to the clean stoichiometric surfaces, an occupied eigenstate with spin up is observed in the band gap of the (001), (100), (101), and (110) surfaces. For these surfaces, the electron in this eigenstate is mostly localized at the vacancy site and spreads slightly on the neighboring La atoms. This is shown by the density plot (|φi|2) of the eigenstate located in the band gap of the (001) surface (see Figure 8b).
The (111) surface behaves differently from the others. Desorbing a Cl atom from the (111) surface creates a filled, spin-up eigenstate at the bottom of the conduction band. A density plot of that state is shown in Figure 8c. The orbital is delocalized over several La atoms located in the bottom stoichiometric layer and there is no electron density near the defect site. This is not an artifact of GGA to favor delocalized over localized eigenstates because we obtained similar results using the PBE + U, with a variety of values for U, and the HSE06 functionals (not shown here).
6.3 The PDOS of the Defective Surfaces Formed by the Desorption of an O Atom
Figure 9(a) shows the total and site projected DOS of the LaOCl surfaces having an upper oxygen vacancy.
Figure 9
Figure 9. (a) Total and site-projected density of states (DOS) of the LaOCl surfaces having one oxygen vacancy. Starting from the top, the surfaces appear in the following order: (001), (100), (101), (110), and (111). The position of the Fermi energy for each surface is indicated by a green dashed vertical line. (b) Density plot of the eigenstate located in the band gap an localized around the oxygen vacancy on a LaOCl(001) surface. (c) Density plot of the highest occupied eigenstate located just below the minimum of the conduction band of a LaOCl(110) surface with an oxygen vacancy. (d) Density plot of the an eigenstate located at the minimum of the conduction band of a LaOCl(111) surface having one oxygen vacancy. Density plots show equal density surfaces of 0.01 e/Å3. The analysis has been performed at the Γ point using the PBE functional, the PAW pseudopotential, and slabs composed of two stoichiometric layers. The supercells are shown in Figures 2–6.
An eigenstate appears in the gap, upon the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the (001), (100), and (101) surfaces. This eigenstate is doubly occupied and the lowest energy structure is a singlet. A density plot of the eigenstate associated with the oxygen vacancy site on the (001) surface is shown in Figure 9b. According to this plot, most of the density is located at the vacancy site and spreads over 4 neighboring La atoms. The eigenstates associated with the oxygen vacancy on (100) and (101) surfaces are similar. Thus, the two electrons left behind upon the desorption of an oxygen atom are localized at the vacancy site. This is similar to what is observed when an oxygen vacancy is formed (41) on La2O3 or on other irreducible oxides (e.g., MgO and CaO).
The desorption of an oxygen atom from the (111) surface does not create an eigenstate in the gap. Instead, two spin up eigenstates located at the bottom of the conduction band become filled. A typical eigenstate located at the minimum of the conduction band is shown in Figure 9d. The plot shows an orbital delocalized over several La atoms in the bottom stoichiometric layer and there is no contribution from the region around the vacancy site (the position of the removed oxygen atom is indicated by a green ball). We have observed the same behavior for the creation of Cl vacancy on this surface.
6.4 The PDOS of the Defective Surfaces Formed by the Spillover of a Cl Atom
Figure 10 shows the total DOS of the clean stoichiometric LaOCl(101) surface after the spillover of an upper Cl atom took place. Similar plots are obtained for the spillover of a lower Cl atom.
Figure 10
Figure 10. Total and site-projected density of states (DOS) after the spillover of an upper Cl atom took place on the clean stoichiometric LaOCl surfaces. Starting from the top, the surfaces appear in the following order: (001), (100), (101), (110), and (111). The position of the Fermi energy for each surface is indicated by a green dashed vertical line. The analysis has been performed at the Γ point using the PBE functional, the PAW pseudopotential, and a slab composed of two stoichiometric layers.
The DOS plots of the (100), (101), (110), and (111) surfaces following the spillover of an upper Cl atom are similar to the ones obtained for the clean stoichiometric surfaces (see Figure 7). The Fermi energies are the same (within the accuracy of the calculations) on both types of surfaces. For example the Fermi energies of the (101) surface before and after the Cl spillover are 6.5 and 6.4 eV, respectively. The most important similarity between the two surfaces is the absence of an occupied eigenstate in the gap following the spillover of a Cl atom.
The behavior of the (001) surface is slightly different. Comparison between Figures 7 and 10 shows the appearance of a two doubly occupied eigenstates in the gap following the spillover of a Cl atom, increasing the Fermi energy from −7.0 to −6.1 eV. These two eigenstates are largely dominated by the orbital of the ″spilled″ Cl atom (not shown).
Analysis of the electronic structure reveals that the Cl atom that left its normal binding site uses the electron left behind at the vacancy site upon creation of the Cl vacancy [see Figure 8], to bind to the surface. This results in the formation of eigenstates involving the orbitals of the spilled Cl atom and of the surface. These eigenstates are resonant with the top of the valence band on the (100), (101), (110), and (111) surfaces (not shown) while they appear in the gap for the (001) surface.
There is thus a fundamental difference between a vacancy created by spillover and one created by the removal of chlorine from the surface. If one views qualitatively the bond of Cl to the oxychloride as formed by an electron pair, then removing a Cl atom from the surface leaves behind one electron that was engaged in the bond prior to its rupture. Our calculations show that when the Cl-spillover takes place this electron is used to pair up with the Cl electron, to form the new Cl-surface bond. When the Cl atom is removed in the gas phase (as 1/2Cl2) one electron, that was part of the electron–pair making the ruptured bond, is left in the slab and it is available to engage in chemistry. Thus, we expect that a vacancy created by Cl removal to vacuum is reactive and a good electron donor, while the vacancy created by Cl spillover is much less reactive. This is confirmed by our unpublished DFT calculations regarding the adsorption of O2 on the LaOCl faces. The presence of a Cl vacancy created by desorbing a Cl atom activates O2 binding to the surface. In contrast, O2 does not bind to the LaOCl surfaces when Cl vacancies are created by spillover of a Cl atom.
7 The Effect of Adding or Removing an Electron from the LaOCl Slabs on the Oxygen and Chlorine Vacancy Formation Energies
The oxides and oxychloride used in catalysis are much less pure than the materials used in solid–state devices. Normally the precursors have a purity of 99.99%. This means that a mole of oxide contains approximately 1022 atoms of unknown elements. By the standards set by electronic materials, such as Si or GaAs, this is a heavily doped system. The unknown dopants can affect the energy of oxygen (or chlorine) vacancy formation directly, by disturbing the binding of O (or Cl) to the system and indirectly, by affecting the Fermi level and therefore the charge of the vacancy. The first effect has been illustrated by a number of calculations that show that low-valence dopants facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancy near the dopant site. (38-40, 42) In addition a “global” effect is also possible: the presence of the dopant changes the Fermi level and this affects the energy of formation and the charge of the vacancy. When the Fermi energy is high the vacancy is likely to be negatively charged; when the Fermi energy is low the vacancy may be charged positively. The dopant transfer electrons to the vacancy or withdraws them and this affects the energy of vacancy formation. (10-12)
Because we do not know the nature and the concentration of the dopants present in a typical LaOCl crystal, we study the effect of dopants by adding or removing an electron from the clean LaOCl slabs.
Table 4 shows the oxygen and chlorine vacancy formation energies obtained on positively charged (i.e., one electron has been removed, Q = + 1e), on neutral (Q = 0), and on negatively charged (i.e., one electron has been added, Q = −1e) LaOCl slabs. A comparison between the second and third columns shows that removing an electron has a dramatic effect on the oxygen and chlorine vacancy formation energies. Upon removal of an electron, Evf decreases by as much as 89%. In contrast, adding an electron has little effect. Comparison between the third and fourth column shows that Evf varies by about 10% at much.

surface Q = +1e Q = 0 Q = −1e
Evf[O]
(001) 2.97(−54%) 6.39 6.43(+1%)
(101) 2.52(−60%) 6.28 6.05(−4%)
(111) 2.40(−49%) 4.70 5.05(+7%)
Evf[Cl]
(001) 0.67(−84%) 4.11 4.25(+3%)
(101) 0.43(−89%) 3.96 3.69(−7%)
(111) 0.89(−70%) 2.93 3.22(+9%)
aQ is the total charge of the slab. See eq 2 for the definition of Evf. The values between parentheses indicate the variation of Evf relative to the value obtained on the neutral slab. The results were obtained with the PBE functional, the PAW pseudopotential, and slabs composed of two stoichiometric layers. See Figures 2–6 for the definition of the supercells used in the calculation.
These observations suggest that adding a dopant which withdraws electrons from the valence band of LaOCl (which is dominated by the atomic orbitals of the O and Cl atoms) should facilitate the creation of oxygen and chlorine vacancies and of all chemical reactions that involve the removal of O or a Cl from the surface.
8 Summary and Discussion
Our calculations indicate that the stoichiometric LaOCl surfaces are not reactive. Because the energy of the highest occupied orbital is so low, the surface will not activate electron accepting molecule, such as O2. Our DFT calculations (unpublished) confirm that O2 does not bind to LaOCl (except by van der Waals interactions).
The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is very high, of the same order as that of making an oxygen vacancy on La2O3. (13) It is surprising that the replacement of one oxygen atom with two Cl atoms, to make the oxychloride, has such a small effect on the binding energy of the oxygen to the surface.
The energies Evf[Cl] of making a Cl vacancy on various faces are fairly high. An exception is the (111) face, for which Evf[Cl] is lower than the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy on ceria (43, 44) or titania. (45) Since these oxides are fairly good oxidants we conclude, by analogy, that the (111) face of LaOCl can provide Cl for a chlorination reaction proceeding through a Mars–van Krevelen-like mechanism. This is consistent with the results of Lercher et al., (1-3) who showed that the Cl atoms in the oxychlorination products originate from the surface, not from the gas. They have also shown that the oxygen atoms in the water produced in the oxychlorination reaction come from the gas phase not from the surface. This is consistent with the high energy required for making oxygen vacancies.
Since the surface energy of a crystal face is a measure of the stability of the surface atoms one would, perhaps naively, expect that the lower the surface energy, the harder it is to create an oxygen or a chlorine vacancy. A comparison between the values of Es (see Table 1) and those of Evf[Cl] (see Table 2) shows that these quantities are not correlated. The surface energy is not a good predictor of the tendency of a surface to “release” an atom. This may happen because surface energy is a “global″ quantity involving equally all atoms in the surface. Vacancy formation is a local event, involving mainly the atoms whose bonds are broken. The local geometry relaxation and the local changes in the electronic structure are important in determining the energy of vacancy formation and this is why the vacancy formation energy and surface energy are not related.
The removal of a Cl atom (to form 1/2Cl2 in the gas phase) from the (001), (100), (101), and (110) surfaces leaves behind an unpaired electron that used to be tied up in the Cl–surface bond. This electron occupies a spin–up eigenstate, whose energy is in the band gap. The removal of an oxygen atom (to make 1/2O2 in gas phase) leaves behind two unpaired electrons which occupy two orbitals whose energy is in the band gap. In both cases, the electrons occupying the eigenstates formed when one atom is removed are essentially localized at the vacancy site, with some overlap with the neighboring La atoms. This behavior is different from TiO2 or CeO2 where it is believed (with good reasons) that the removal of an oxygen atom changes the formal charge of two Ti or two Ce atoms from +4 to +3; the unpaired electrons left behind (when O is removed) are localized on Ti or Ce. (43-45) Unlike Ce or Ti, La has a strong preference for forming trivalent compounds (though LaH2, LaS, LaSe, LaTe exist) and LaOCl is a nonreducible compound. The unpaired electrons have no place to go when a vacancy is formed.
The fact that the unpaired electrons are localized at the vacancy site indicates that these vacancies react readily with electrophilic molecules. In particular, they adsorb O2 and convert it into a reactive species.
The defective LaOCl(111) surface behaves differently from other faces: the electrons left behind, when a Cl or an O vacancy is made, are delocalized and their energy is at the minimum of the conduction band. This is not related to the tendency of the GGA functional to have a preference for delocalized over localized eigenstates because we get similar results using the PBE + U and the HSE06 (35-37) functional.
The spillover of Cl atoms provides an alternative way of creating Cl vacancies. The energy involved (see Table 2) is much smaller than the energy for making a vacancy by desorbing 1/2Cl2 (see Table 2). However the vacancies made by spillover do not react with electrofiles because these vacancies do not contain unpaired electrons; the latter are used to bind the adsorbed Cl atoms to the surface. They are not available for activating electrophilic molecules. For example, O2 does not bind to a Cl vacancy created by the spillover of a Cl atom, while it binds to vacancies created by Cl removal from the surface.
The creation of O and Cl vacancies during the oxychlorination of methane is likely to proceed along more efficient processes. The reaction between a stoichiometric LaOCl surface and two HCl molecules to make a water molecule in gas phase and leave two Cl atoms on the defective LaOCl surface (e.i. having one O–vacancy because of water formation) releases 1.99 and 1.62 eV on the LaOCl(101) and LaOCl(111) surfaces, respectively. The same reaction is endothermic by 1.32 eV on the LaOCl(001) surface. There is therefore no thermodynamic hindrance to the chlorination of the surface by HCl accompanied by oxygen removal. However, the O vacancy formed by this reaction is not chemically active toward gas phase O2, because the two electrons that were engaged in the broken O–surface bonds are used by the two Cl atoms (provided by HCl) to make a bond with the surface. Thus, the creation of reactive Cl or O vacancy can only be accomplished by a reaction which leaves behind more electrons than required to bind the fragments of the reactive gases. Work is in progress to identify such a reaction which releases energy at the same time. This would be the key to activate the clean stoichiometric LaOCl surfaces.

Figure 2. (a) Top view of the LaOCl(001) surface showing a [3 × 3] supercell. The unit cell is defined by the region contained within the black dashed lines. The x-, y-, and z-axes are aligned along the [100], [010], and [001] directions, respectively. (b) Side view of the LaOCl(001) surface along the [100] direction showing a slab composed of two stoichiometric layers. We show only two stoichiometric layers (more layers were used in the calculations). The atoms in the bottom stoichiometric layer (BL) are colored differently from the ones in the top stoichiometric layer.
