First-principles calculations have evolved from mere aids in explaining and supporting experiments
to powerful tools for predicting new materials and their properties. In the ﬁrst part of this review we
describe the state-of-the-art computational methodology for calculating the structure and energetics
of point defects and impurities in semiconductors. We will pay particular attention to computational
aspects which are unique to defects or impurities, such as how to deal with charge states and how
to describe and interpret transition levels. In the second part of the review we will illustrate these
capabilities with examples for defects and impurities in nitride semiconductors. Point defects have
traditionally been considered to play a major role in wide-band-gap semiconductors, and
ﬁrst-principles calculations have been particularly helpful in elucidating the issues. Speciﬁcally,
calculations have shown that the unintentional n-type conductivity that has often been observed in
as-grown GaN cannot be attributed to nitrogen vacancies, but is due to unintentional incorporation
of donor impurities. Native point defects may play a role in compensation and in phenomena such
as the yellow luminescence, which can be attributed to gallium vacancies. In the section on
impurities, speciﬁc attention will be focused on dopants. Oxygen, which is commonly present as a
contaminant, is a shallow donor in GaN but becomes a deep level in AlGaN due to a DX transition.
Magnesium is almost universally used as the p-type dopant, but hole concentrations are still limited.
Reasons for this behavior are discussed, and alternative acceptors are examined. Hydrogen plays an
important role in p-type GaN, and the mechanisms that underlie its behavior are explained.
Incorporating hydrogen along with acceptors is an example of codoping; a critical discussion of
codoping is presented. Most of the information available to date for defects and impurities in
nitrides has been generated for GaN, but we will also discuss AlN and InN where appropriate. We
conclude by summarizing the main points and looking towards the future. © 2004 American

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Goals
The properties of materials are often controlled by de-
fects and impurities. This is particularly true in the case of
semiconductors, where the incorporation of impurities in
small concentrations determines the electrical conductivity.
The fabrication of p-type and n-type doped layers underlies
the design of virtually all electronic and optoelectronic de-
vices. To achieve such control, comprehensive knowledge of
the fundamental processes that control doping is required. In
recent years, ﬁrst-principles calculations have made impor-
tant contributions to this knowledge.
Thanks to algorithmic developments as well as increases
in computer power, ﬁrst-principles calculations are now
reaching unprecedented levels of accuracy in treating in-
creasingly larger systems at the microscopic level. State-of-
the-art calculations for solids are based on density-functional
theory and produce detailed information about atomic struc-
ture ~including relaxations!, wave functions, charge densi-
ties, potentials, and energies. All of these data can be used to
elucidate the properties of impurities and point defects, as
will be illustrated with many examples in this review. The
aspect that we will focus on most closely, and that has
proved crucial in relation to studying doping, is the forma-
tion energy of point defects. We will describe a formalism
that allows calculation of defect and impurity concentrations
based on ﬁrst-principles formation energies; this formalism
also addresses the energetics of charge states, and hence the
thermodynamic transition levels associated with deep and
shallow impurities and defects.
The formalism is entirely general in nature and could be
applied to any semiconductor or insulator. The goal of the
ﬁrst part of the article ~Sec. II! is to provide an overview of
the
state-of-the-art
methodology
for
performing
ﬁrst-
principles calculations for defects and impurities. The aim is
not to address the fundamentals of density-functional or
pseudopotential theory, or to provide a guide on how to run
ﬁrst-principles computer codes–various excellent reviews
are available for that purpose.1–3 Rather, we intend Sec. II to
be useful for a computational theorist getting started in de-
fect calculations, as well as for more experienced practitio-
ners looking for a reference to some of the details that are
important in practical calculations. In addition, this section is
intended to be accessible to experimentalists who are curious
about the background of the computational work or have
questions about some of the underlying assumptions.
The methodology described in Sec. II will be illustrated
with speciﬁc examples in the latter half of the review. We
will focus on one speciﬁc material system, namely, the III–V
nitrides. Two Applied Physics Reviews have recently ap-
peared that cover this set of materials. One, by Vurgaftman
and Meyer,4 presents a comprehensive compilation of band
parameters for all of the nitrogen-containing III–V semicon-
ductors that have been investigated to date. The second, by
Bhuiyan et al.,5 reviews the growth, characterization, and
properties of InN and contains a brief discussion of defects.
In the present article we focus on the properties of defects
and impurities in III-nitrides. Section III contains results for
native defects, while Sec. IV describes impurities. A review
of computational studies on GaN by Estreicher and Boucher6
covered developments through 1995, but much has happened
since then.
In the remainder of this Introduction we provide some
additional motivation for defect studies in nitrides, an impor-
tant issue being the realization of adequate doping. We there-
fore also provide a discussion of doping limitations in semi-
conductors in general.
B. Doping problems in nitrides
Within the past decade the nitride semiconductors have
emerged as a very important materials system because they
are uniquely suited to light emission in the green, blue, and
UV regions of the spectrum–wavelength regions that were
previously not accessible with solid-state light emitters.

n-type doping of nitrides has never been a problem; in fact,
as-grown material has often exhibited unintentional n-type
conductivity, the cause of which was widely debated. n-type
doping with electron concentrations exceeding 1019 cm23
can routinely be achieved. p-type doping, however, has tra-
ditionally been very difﬁcult. p-type doping was ﬁrst
achieved by Amano et al. in 1989,7 who observed that Mg-
doped GaN grown by MOCVD ~metal-organic chemical va-
por deposition! was highly resistive after growth, but could
be activated by low-energy electron beam irradiation. Naka-
mura et al.8 subsquently showed that the Mg activation can
also be achieved by thermal annealing at 700 °C under N2
ambient. Nakamura et al. further observed that the process
was reversible, with p-type GaN reverting to semi-insulating
when annealed in a NH3 ambient, revealing the crucial role
played by hydrogen. Since then, hole concentrations on the
order of 1018 cm23 have been achieved and used in devices.
Still, the limited conductivity of p-type doped layers consti-
tutes an impediment for progress in device applications.
C. Fundamental causes of doping limitations
When discussing doping of semiconductors, and its in-
herent limitations and difﬁculties, a number of factors need
to be considered. Here we enumerate them and illustrate
them with the example of p-type doping of GaN.
1. Solubility
To achieve a high free-carrier concentration, one obvi-
ously needs to achieve a high concentration of the dopant
impurity. The solubility corresponds to the maximum con-
centration that the impurity can attain in the semiconductor,
under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium. This con-
centration depends on temperature, and on the abundance of
the impurity as well as the host constituents in the growth
environment. Increasing the abundance of the impurity ~or its
chemical potential, see Sec. II E! does not necessarily in-
crease the concentration of impurities incorporated in the
solid, because it may become more favorable for the impu-
rity to form a different phase. For instance, we will see that
the solubility of Mg in GaN is limited by formation of
Mg3N2 ~see Sec. II E!. In previous work on wide-band-gap
semiconductors, it was found that the hole concentration in
ZnSe and ZnTe is limited by the solubility of the acceptor
impurities ~Na, Li, and N!.9
2. Ionization energy
The ionization energy of a dopant determines the frac-
tion of dopants that will contribute free carriers at a given
temperature. A high ionization energy limits the doping efﬁ-
ciency: for instance, the ionization energy of Mg in GaN
~around 200 meV! is so large that at room temperature only
about 1% of Mg atoms are ionized. This means that a Mg
concentration of 1020 cm23 only leads to a hole concentra-
tion of about 1018 cm23. Ionization energies are largely de-
termined by intrinsic properties of the semiconductor, such
as effective masses, dielectric constant, etc. Switching to a
different acceptor has therefore no dramatic effect on the
ionization energy.
3. Incorporation of impurities in other conﬁgurations
In order for Mg in GaN to act as an acceptor, it needs to
be incorporated on the gallium site. There has been concern
about Mg incorporating in other positions in the lattice, such
as an interstitial position, or substituting for a nitrogen atom
~essentially an antisite conﬁguration!. For GaN:Mg ~GaN
doped with Mg!, we have shown that these other conﬁgura-
tions are always much higher in energy, and hence will not
form.10 In other cases, however, such competition may be a
serious issue: for instance, while Li on the Ga site in GaN
forms an acceptor, Li on an interstitial site is a donor, and
because of its small size it is energetically very favorable.11
This can obviously lead to serious self-compensation.
Another instance of impurities incorporating in undesir-
able conﬁgurations consists of the so-called DX centers. The
prototype DX center is Si in AlGaAs ~for a review, see Ref.
12!. In GaAs and in AlGaAs with low Al content, Si behaves
as a shallow donor. But when the Al content exceeds a criti-
cal value, Si behaves as a deep level. This has been ex-
plained in terms of Si moving off the substitutional site, to-
wards an interstitial position.13 It has been found that oxygen
forms a DX center in AlGaN, when the Al content exceeds
about
30%.14
This
prediction
has
been
conﬁrmed
experimentally.15
4. Compensation by native point defects
Native defects are point defects intrinsic to the semicon-
ductor, such as vacancies ~missing atoms!, self-interstitials
~additional atoms incorporated on sites other than substitu-
tional sites!, and antisites ~in a compound semiconductor, a
cation sitting on a nominal anion site, or vice versa!. Native
defects have frequently been invoked to explain doping
problems in semiconductors. For instance, the problem of
achieving
p-type
ZnSe
was
long
attributed
to
self-
compensation by native defects: it was hypothesized that ev-
ery attempt to incorporate acceptors would be accompanied
by the spontaneous generation of large numbers of native
defects, acting as donors. In the case of ZnSe, it was shown
that compensation by native defects is not an insurmountable
problem.16 Some degree of compensation is often unavoid-
able, but this problem is not necessarily more severe in wide-
band-gap semiconductors than in, say, GaAs. For GaN, we
have found that compensation by vacancies can limit the
doping level in some cases: gallium vacancies (VGa) are ac-
ceptors and compensate n-type GaN; nitrogen vacancies
(VN) are single donors and compensate p-type GaN.
Native defects have sometimes been invoked to play a
role that goes beyond compensation, namely, to act as a
source of doping. For instance, the frequently observed
n-type conductivity of as-grown GaN was long attributed to
nitrogen vacancies. Nitrogen vacancies indeed act as shallow
donors, but their incorporation in n-type GaN costs too much
energy for them to be present in the large concentrations
necessary to explain the observed n-type conductivity.17
5. Compensation by foreign impurities
This source of compensation may seem rather obvious,
but we mention it for completeness, and it often plays a

crucial role: for instance, when doping with acceptors ~such
as magnesium! in order to obtain p-type conductivity, impu-
rities that act as donors ~such as oxygen! should be carefully
controlled. Such control may be more difﬁcult than is obvi-
ous at ﬁrst sight. For instance, for reasons that will be ex-
plained in Sec. IV B 3, the presence in the growth system of
a contaminating impurity with donor character may lead to a
much larger incorporation of this impurity in p-type material
than in n-type material.
Each and every one of the factors listed here can be
explicitly examined using a computational approach, and
Secs. III and IV will contain explicit examples of results.
II. METHODOLOGY
Modern ﬁrst-principles calculations have had a major
impact on the understanding of defects and impurities in
semiconductors. With the capability to calculate total ener-
gies, it became possible to investigate the atomic structure of
the defect; i.e., the stable position in the host lattice, the
relaxation of the surrounding atoms, as well as the energy
along a migration path.18–20 More recently, formalisms have
been developed to use the total energy of the defect to cal-
culate its concentration, under the assumption of thermody-
namic equilibrium.21,22 The same formalism can also be ap-
plied to the calculation of impurity solubilities.9,23 In the
following sections we describe this formalism in detail.
A. Concentrations of defects
In thermodynamic equilibrium the concentration c of an
impurity, defect, or complex is given by the expression
c5NsitesNconﬁg exp~2E f/kT!
.
~1!
Here, E f is the formation energy ~see Sec. II B 4!, Nsites is the
number of sites in the lattice ~per unit volume! where the
defect can be incorporated, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and T
is the temperature. Nconﬁg is the number of equivalent con-
ﬁgurations in which the defect can be incorporated. For va-
cancies, antisites, and subsitutional defects Nconﬁg51 if no
symmetry breaking occurs. If symmetry breaking occurs or if
complexes are formed it is the number of inequivalent con-
ﬁgurations in which the defect can be incorporated on the
same site.
1. Justiﬁcation for the thermodynamic equilibrium
approach
The expression for concentration as a function of forma-
tion energy @Eq. ~1!# is, strictly speaking, only valid in ther-
modynamic equilibrium. Growth of semiconductors is obvi-
ously a nonequilibrium process. How then do we justify
using Eq. ~1! and attaching relevance to formation energies?
The justiﬁcation is based on the argument that many growth
situations are close enough to equilibrium to warrant the use
of the equilibrium approach. An important consideration here
is that not all aspects of the process need to be in equilibrium
in order to justify the use of equilibrium expressions for
defects and impurities. What is required is a sufﬁciently high
mobility of the relevant impurities and point defects to allow
them to equilibrate at the temperatures of interest.
2. Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) versus MOCVD
growth
MOCVD growth of GaN is carried out at high tempera-
tures ~usually between 1000 and 1100 °C). The mobility of
various point defects,24 both on the Ga and on the N sublat-
tice, should be sufﬁciently high to allow equilibration of the
defects and impurities that are being incorporated in the
bulk. Under these circumstances, point defects will incorpo-
rate in concentrations determined by their formation ener-
gies, which, as discussed below, depend on the relative abun-
dance of the various species in the growth environment.
MBE growth, on the other hand, is carried out at lower tem-
peratures (;800 °C), and the assumption of thermodynamic
equilibrium is less likely to be satisﬁed. MBE-grown mate-
rial may thus in principle exhibit point-defect concentrations
that deviate from their equilibrium values.
We do want to make the point that, even if the equilib-
rium conditions are not met that would justify use of Eq. ~1!
to derive concentrations, the formation energies deﬁned in
Sec. II B 4 are still physically meaningful. Nonequilibrium
implies that once certain high-energy defects form, kinetic
barriers may preserve them, even if their concentration ex-
ceeds the nominal equilibrium value. It should be clear, how-
ever, that defects with a high formation energy will always
be unlikely to form, since a lot of energy needs to be ex-
pended in their creation, and the driving force to lowering
the energy is large.
3. Surface effects
An exception of the above argument is the creation of
defects at the surface: There the defect formation energy may
be signiﬁcantly different from the bulk formation energy, due
to structural as well as electronic effects. The structural ef-
fects can be due, for instance, to local strains underneath
speciﬁc features of reconstructed surfaces, as discussed by
Tersoff in the case of C incorporation in Si.25 The electronic
effects are related to the band bending that is usually present
near semiconductor surfaces. As discussed in Sec. II B, the
formation energies of charged defects and impurities depend
sensitively on the Fermi level, and near the surface the posi-
tion of the Fermi level with respect to the band edges can be
strongly shifted due to the presence of space-charge layers.
Typically, defect formation energies at the surface are
lower, resulting in high defect concentrations at the surface.
In cases where complete equilibration within the bulk of the
growing material is not accomplished, it may still be possible
for limited equilibration to occur within the ﬁrst few atomic
layers beneath the growing surface, where diffusion over
short length scales may still be possible. Since the defect
formation energy quickly converges to its bulk value when
moving the defect from the surface to bulk ~see, e.g., Ref.
26! even limited equilibration within the ﬁrst few atomic
layers is sufﬁcient to achieve bulk defect concentrations.
A comprehensive examination of the effects of surfaces
on the incorporation of defects and impurities is beyond the
scope of the present review. In the nitrides, we are aware of
the following studies: Bungaro et al.27 investigated Mg in-
corporation at GaN~0001! surfaces; Zywietz et al. calculated

B. Formation energies
1. Techniques for estimating or calculating formation
energies
Hartree–Fock
based
models
commonly
employ
quantum-chemistry approaches that have been successfully
applied to atoms and molecules. The main problems with the
technique are the neglect of correlation effects and the com-
putational demands: ab initio Hartree–Fock methods can
only be applied to systems with small numbers of atoms. The
reason is that these methods require the evaluation of a large
number of multicenter integrals. Simpler semiempirical
methods have been developed that either neglect or approxi-
mate some of these integrals. The accuracy and reliability of
these methods is hard to assess.
Information about point defects and impurities can in
principle also be obtained from tight-binding calculations.
Tight-binding methods use the fact that within a local basis
set the Hamilton matrix elements rapidly decrease with in-
creasing distance between the orbitals. Thus, instead of hav-
ing to diagonalize the full Hamiltonian matrix most of the
matrix elements vanish and only a sparse matrix has to be
diagonalized. Depending on how the remaining Hamilton
matrix elements are determined one can distinguish two
main approaches: ~i! empirical tight-binding methods and ~ii!
ﬁrst-principles tight-binding methods.
An important problem for the empirical tight-binding ap-
proach is the choice of parameters, for which there is no
consistent prescription. The shortcomings of tight-binding
theory were highlighted in early work on point defects in
GaN, where the a1 state of the nitrogen vacancy was found
to lie close to the bottom of the conduction band.32,33 In
reality, this state lies near the top of the valence band.17 The
location of this state is determined by the strong interaction
between Ga dangling bonds surrounding the nitrogen va-
cancy; the tight-binding calculations of Refs. 32 and 33,
which only took nearest-neighbor interactions into account,
failed to include this interaction, resulting in an incorrect
positioning of the defect levels. The origin of the failing of a
ﬁrst nearest-neighbor tight-binding method is the extremely
ionic character and the ~correspondingly! small lattice con-
stant of the group-III nitrides.17 Second nearest-neighbor in-
teractions therefore play an important role.
First-principles tight-binding methods use local orbitals
to explicitly calculate the Hamilton matrix elements. The
choice of orbitals is critical: instead of the standard local
orbitals ~e.g., atomic orbitals!, speciﬁcally designed and ex-
tremely localized orbitals are used. Approximations are made
in neglecting some of the multi-center integrals and charge
self-consistency. For group-III nitrides which are highly
ionic, this approximation is not well satisﬁed. Signiﬁcant im-
provement has been found by using a point-charge model to
take charge transfer and polarizability into account.34
2. Density-functional theory
Density-functional theory ~DFT! calculations based on
pseudopotentials, a plane-wave basis set, and a supercell ge-
ometry are now regarded as a standard for performing ﬁrst-
principles studies of defects in semiconductors. DFT in the
local density approximation ~LDA!35 allows a description of
the many-body electronic ground state in terms of single-
particle equations and an effective potential. The effective
potential consists of the ionic potential due to the atomic
cores, the Hartree potential describing the electrostatic
electron-electron interaction, and the exchange-correlation
potential that takes into account the many-body effects. This
approach has proven to describe with high accuracy such
quantities as atomic geometries, charge densities, formation
energies, etc. Most of the results described in Secs. III and
IV are based on an implementation of pseudopotential-
density-functional theory described in Ref. 3.
An analysis of GaN defect and bulk calculations showed
that the Ga 3d electrons are not chemically inert but play an
important role for the chemical bonding.36–38 Thus, in gen-
eral the Ga 3d electrons cannot be simply treated as core
electrons ~which would be computationally less expensive!
but have to be explicitly treated as valence electrons.38 The
localized nature of the Ga 3d states signiﬁcantly increases
the computational demand, requiring an energy cutoff of at
least 60 Ry in the plane-wave expansions. An attractive al-
ternative is to use the so-called ‘‘nonlinear core correction’’
(nlcc),39
in
combination
with
soft
Troullier–Martins
pseudopotentials40 for which an energy cutoff of 40 Ry suf-
ﬁces.
The explicit inclusion of Ga 3d states as valence states
yields demonstrable improvements in the structural proper-
ties as well as in the enthalpy of formation. In large part,
these improvements can also be achieved by using the
nlcc.41 For the electronic structure, however, the beneﬁt of
explicitly including Ga 3d states is unclear. DFT-LDA places
these d states too high in the band structure, causing them to
be closer to the valence-band maximum ~VBM!; p–d repul-
sion then causes the VBM to be pushed up, leading to a
decrease in the band gap. This effect has actually been found
to persist in GW calculations.42 The inclusion of 3d states in
calculations of band-structure-related properties such as alloy
band gaps or deformation potentials may therefore not nec-
essarily be an improvement compared to the use of the nlcc,
where the effects of d states are only approximated and the
anomalous repulsion between d states and the VBM is ab-
sent.
Defect and impurity calculations should be carried out at
the theoretical lattice constant, in order to avoid a spurious
elastic interaction with defects or impurities in neighboring
supercells. Since our purpose is to investigate properties for
a single, isolated defect or impurity in an inﬁnite solid, the
lattice constant of the supercell should correspond to that of
the unperturbed host. It has sometimes been suggested that,
in the process of relaxing the host atoms around the defect,
the volume of the supercell should be relaxed as well. Such a
volume relaxation would actually correspond to ﬁnding the
lattice constant of a bulk system containing an ordered array
of impurities at very high concentration. This could result in

a very different lattice constant from the one we are inter-
ested in, corresponding to a dilute system.
Well-converged calculations with good-quality pseudo-
potentials should produce lattice parameters within a few
percent of the experimental value. When the Ga 3d electrons
are explicitly included, with an 80 Ry energy cutoff,43 we
ﬁnd ath53.193 Å ~compared with aexp53.19 Å). The calcu-
lated c/a ratio is 1.634 ~experiment: 1.627!, very close to the
ideal c/a ratio of A8/351.633. For zinc-blende GaN, we
ﬁnd ath54.518 Å, which is ~to within 0.002 Å! & larger
than the wurtzite lattice constant. Using the nlcc and a 40
Ry energy cutoff, the values are ath53.089 Å and c/a
51.633; and for zinc-blende GaN: ath54.370 Å, again ~to
within 0.001 Å! & larger than the wurtzite lattice constant.
For calculations of defects and impurities in semicon-
ductors within the density-functional approach, use of the
local density approximation seems to be well justiﬁed. The
generalized gradient approximation ~GGA! apparently does
not offer any advantages, neither for bulk properties43 nor for
formation energies of point defects.44 The quantitative differ-
ences that exist for the latter can be explained in terms of
differences in the lattice constant ~which gives rise to differ-
ences in the band gap! and in calculated formation enthalpies
between LDA and GGA.44,41
3. Beyond density-functional theory
One shortcoming of the DFT approach is its failure to
produce accurate excited-states properties—the band gap is
commonly underestimated.45,46 Research is currently under
way to overcome this limitation of density-functional theory.
No method is currently available that goes beyond DFT and
provides total-energy capability for the large supercell calcu-
lations required to investigate defects. Even methods aimed
solely at calculating the band structure, such as the GW
approach,47–49 are currently prohibitively expensive for large
cells.
A promising approach that yields bulk band structures in
good agreement with experiment was recently introduced,
based on self-interaction and relaxation-corrected ~SIRC!
pseudopotentials.50 This approach was used in Ref. 51 to
perform calculations of the electronic structure of bulk InN
and of various native point defects. Defects can introduce
levels in the band gap, and when occupied with electrons
these levels contribute to the total energy of the system; it is
therefore important to consider the effect of the band-gap
error on the calculated properties of defects.
The study of Ref. 51 indicated that the character of the
defect-induced states is very similar in SIRC calculations
compared to LDA, but conduction-band related states are
shifted to higher energies. The SIRC approach currently does
not simply allow evaluation of total energies, and therefore
the effects of the calculated changes in the band structure on
the total energy of the defect were only estimated, without
inclusion of selfconsistency. Still, it could be concluded that
while total energies may be affected in some instances, at
least for InN the shifts do not alter the conclusions based on
the DFT calculations.
The SIRC potentials used in Ref. 51 produced a band
gap of wurtzite InN of 1.55 eV, which was considered in
reasonable agreement with the commonly accepted band-gap
value of 1.9 eV. Very recently,52,53 it has become clear that
the band gap of InN is actually only ;0.8 eV. This does not
affect the conclusions reported in Ref. 51: indeed, if the
qualitative conclusions of the LDA conclusions remain valid
even when the band gap is increased to 1.55 eV, then they
should certainly still apply when the band gap is only
;0.8 eV.
Other approaches have recently emerged that go beyond
density-functional theory and look promising for addressing
properties of defects and impurities. The ﬁxed-node diffusion
quantum Monte Carlo method was applied to the study of
silicon self-interstitials in Ref. 54. The formation energy of
the split-^110& interstitial defect was found to be signiﬁcantly
higher ~by 1.6 eV! in the quantum Monte Carlo approach
than in LDA. While this is a large number, it can probably be
almost completely attributed to the upward shift of defect-
induced levels in the band gap. Indeed, a shift of 0.7 eV
needs to be applied to the LDA conduction band to bring it
into agreement with experiment ~and, presumably, the quan-
tum Monte Carlo result!. Assuming that the self-interstitial-
induced t2 level undergoes a similar shift, its occupation with
two electrons would raise the energy by 1.4 eV. In spite of
the lack of selfconsistency, this estimate is close to the cal-
culated difference between LDA and quantum Monte Carlo.
Finally, we mention another promising approach that
may overcome the limitations of DFT-LDA, namely, the use
of an ‘‘Exact exchange’’ Kohn–Sham formalism. It has been
demonstrated that this approach can produce high-quality
band structures for semiconductors,55 and in principle it
lends itself to a self-consistent evaluation of total energies.
Unfortunately, the computational requirements are currently
prohibitive, and creative approaches to improve the compu-
tational efﬁciency will be essential in order to apply the
method to supercell calculations.
4. Deﬁnition of formation energy
The formation energy of a defect or impurity X in charge
state q is deﬁned as
E f@Xq#5Etot@Xq#2Etot@GaN,bulk#
2(
i
nimi1q@EF1Ev1DV#.
~2!
Etot@X# is the total energy derived from a supercell calcula-
tion with one impurity or defect X
in the cell, and
Etot@GaN,bulk# is the total energy for the equivalent super-
cell containing only bulk GaN. ni indicates the number of
atoms of type i ~host atoms or impurity atoms! that have
been added to (ni.0) or removed from (ni,0) the super-
cell when the defect or impurity is created, and the mi are the
corresponding chemical potentials of these species. Chemical
potentials are discussed in detail in Sec. II E; for now, it
sufﬁces to know that these chemical potentials represent the
energy of the reservoirs with which atoms are being ex-
changed.
EF is the Fermi level, referenced to the valence-band
maximum in the bulk. Due to the choice of this reference, we
need to explicitly put in the energy of the bulk valence-band

maximum, Ev , in our expressions for formation energies of
charged states. As discussed in Sec. II C, we also need to add
a correction term DV, to align the reference potential in our
defect supercell with that in the bulk.
To illustrate these concepts, let us provide a speciﬁc ex-
ample. For this we choose a Mg acceptor in GaN, because it
will allow us to address a number of relevant issues.

The correction term Ecorr that appears in the formation en-
ergy of MgGa
0 is speciﬁc to shallow centers, and is discussed
in Sec. II D 3.
In principle, the free energy should be used in Eq. ~1!.
Use of the ~zero-temperature! formation energy as deﬁned in
Eq. ~2! implies that contributions from vibrational entropy
are neglected. Explicit calculations of such entropies are very
demanding, and currently not feasible for the large number
of defects to be addressed. These entropy contributions can-
cel to some extent, e.g., when solubilities are calculated; in
general, they are small enough not to affect qualitative con-
clusions. Experimental and theoretical results for entropies
of point defects show that the entropy is typically in the
range between 0 and 10 k, where k is the Boltzmann con-
stant. A simple estimate based on an Einstein model for the
phonon frequencies gives values between 3 and 5k for the
native defects in GaN.
Entropy effects can play an important role under certain
circumstances; for instance, they have been suggested to be
responsible for the stabilization of a speciﬁc conﬁguration of
the Mg–H complex, where the free energy is lowered due to
the large entropy associated with a low-energy excitation.79
In general, however, the inclusion of entropy does not cause
any qualitative change in the results.
5. Supercells
The most common approach for performing calculations
for impurties and defects is in a supercell geometry. The
defect is surrounded by a ﬁnite number of semiconductor
atoms, and that whole structure is periodically repeated.56–59
This geometry allows the use of various techniques which
require translational periodicity of the system. Provided the
impurities are sufﬁciently well separated, properties of a
single isolated impurity can be derived.
A major advantage of the supercell method is that the
band structure of the host crystal is well described. Indeed, it
should be clear that performing a calculation for a supercell
that is simply ﬁlled with the host crystal, in the absence of
any defect, simply produces the band structure of the host.
This contrasts with cluster approaches, where the host is
modeled by a ﬁnite number of semiconductor atoms termi-
nated at a surface ~which is typically hydrogenated, in order
to eliminate surface states!. Even fairly large clusters typi-
cally still produce sizeable quantum conﬁnement effects
which signiﬁcantly affect the band structure, and interactions
between defect wave functions and the cluster surface are
hard to avoid.
An alternative approach that provides a good description
of the band structure of the host crystal is based on the
Green’s function determined for the perfect crystal. This
function is then used to calculate changes induced by the
presence of the defect.60 The Green’s function approach
seems to be more cumbersome and less physically transpar-
ent than the supercell technique. Still, it is occasionally used,
for instance in the linear mufﬁn-tin orbital calculations of
Gorczyca et al. for GaN, AlN, and BN.61,62 However, their
implementation of the method only allowed treatment of
ideal substitutional defects, without inclusion of relaxations.
In order to study the atomic and electronic structure of
an impurity in the GaN crystal, we construct an artiﬁcial unit
cell ~supercell! composed of several primitive GaN unit cells
and containing one impurity. The larger the supercell size,
the closer our results will be to the case of a single, isolated
impurity, because interactions between impurities in neigh-
boring supercells are suppressed. Convergence as a function
of supercell size should always be checked. Typical super-
cells for the wurtzite structure contain 32, 72, or 96 atoms.
The 32-atom supercell is composed of eight wurtzite GaN
primitive unit cells ~each containing four atoms!, such that
each translation vector of the supercell is doubled from that
of the basic unit cell ~see Fig. 1!. For the 72-atom supercell,
the primitive unit cell is repeated three times in each of the
basal-plane directions. Both 32- and 72-atom supercells suf-
fer from the problem that the separation between impurities
in neighboring supercells is quite different when measured
along different directions. The 96-atom supercell avoids this
problem by having translation vectors that are mutually per-
pendicular, leading to a cell with orthorombic symmetry.
For the zinc-blende ~ZB! structure, typical supercells
contain 32 or 64 atoms. The 32-atom supercell has bcc sym-
metry, while the 64-atom cell is cubic, consisting of the con-
ventional eight-atom cubic unit cell of the zinc-blende struc-
ture doubled in each direction.
Within the supercell, relaxation of several shells of host
atoms around the impurity or defect is always included. In a
96-atom supercell, relaxing all atoms within a sphere of ra-
dius 4.8 Å around a substitutional impurity corresponds to
relaxing 46 atoms ~seven shells of atoms!. In the zinc-blende
64-atom cell, the same relaxation radius leads to at least 44
atoms being relaxed ~ﬁve shells!. These relaxation radii are
FIG. 1. Top view ~along @0001# direction! of the GaN wurtzite structure:
small circles represent nitrogen, large circles gallium. The shaded area cor-
responds to the primitive unit cell. The translation vectors for the primitive
unit cell and for the 32-, 72-, and 96-atom supercells are also shown.

typically sufﬁcient to capture all relevant relaxations around
a defect; however, some exceptions exist where longer-range
relaxations are important, for instance around divacancies in
silicon63 and around gallium interstitials in GaN.24
Convergence tests for point defects and impurities indi-
cate that, for zinc blende, 32-atom and 64-atom supercells
yield very similar results, indicating convergence. For wurtz-
ite, the absolute values of formation energies are not yet
converged in a 32-atom cell. The 96-atom cell results are
expected to be converged; for substitional impurities, these
results ~for neutral and singly charged states! are very close
to the ZB 64-atom cells.64
6. Special k-points
Brillouin-zone integrations are carried out using the
Monkhorst–Pack scheme65 with a regularly spaced mesh of
n3n3n points in the reciprocal unit cell shifted from the
origin ~to avoid picking up the G point as one of the sam-
pling points!. Symmetry reduces this set to a set of points in
the irreducible part of the Brillouin zone.
When we describe a defect in a supercell approach,
defect–defect interactions between defects in neighboring
supercells lead to dispersion of the defect-induced levels in
the band gap. A truly isolated defect ~corresponding to the
limit of an inﬁnitely large supercell! would lead to a ﬂat,
dispersionless level. The use of special points actually pro-
vides a way of averaging over the defect band that leads to a
result that should be very close to the level of the isolated
defect. Note that this implies that the G point, which is some-
times used for Brillouin-zone integrations due to the result-
ing numerical simplicity, provides a very poor description
since there the defect-defect interaction reaches its maxi-
mum.
These arguments show that for a fully occupied defect
level the use of special points will lead to a contribution to
the total energy that is a good approximation to the value
expected for an isolated defect. Care should be taken, how-
ever, in cases where the defect level is only partially occu-
pied. Most computational schemes assume a ‘‘metallic’’ oc-
cupation of electronic levels, meaning that eigenvalues are
ﬁlled with electrons up to a Fermi level that is calculated to
yield the correct total number of electrons in the same. If the
partially occupied defect level is the highest occupied elec-
tronic level, then this metallic occupation ~potentially with
some ‘‘smearing’’ representing a ﬁnite temperature! results in
a larger fraction of electrons being placed at k points where
the eigenvalues of the defect level are lower. This unequal
occupation of the defect level then produces a poor approxi-
mation to the total energy. Indeed, since averaging over the
dispersion of the defect level produces the best approxima-
tion to the position of the defect level of the isolated defect,
one should make sure that states at different k points corre-
sponding to the same defect level are equally occupied. Do-
ing so has been found to yield measurable improvements in
convergence as a function of supercell size.66
Convergence tests indicate that for zinc blende, the
23232 sampling yields total energies that are converged to
better than 0.1 eV in both 32-atom and 64-atom supercells.
For the 32-atom wurtzite supercell, a 23232 set does not
yield fully converged results. In the 96-atom wurtzite cell,
ﬁnally, the 23232 k point mesh produces converged re-
sults, i.e., increasing the k point sampling changes the energy
only by ;0.01 eV.24
7. Self-consistent calculation of defect concentrations
In Sec. II A we discussed how concentrations of defects
and impurities depend on formation energies, and in Sec.
II B 4 we showed how these formation energies are deﬁned.
We found that the formation energies depend on atomic and
electronic chemical potentials. The atomic chemical poten-
tials reﬂect the experimental conditions that exist during
growth or impurity incorporation, and as such are explicitly
variable. However, the electronic chemical potential ~i.e., the
Fermi level!, is not a free parameter. It is of course a quantity
that we experimentally want to inﬂuence, speciﬁcally by
doping of the semiconductor–and within our framework we
do that by including dopant impurities. But the Fermi level
EF cannot be directly varied; ultimately, it is determined by
the condition of charge neutrality. In principle equations such
as Eq. ~2! can be formulated for every point defect and im-
purity in the material; the complete problem ~including free-
carrier concentrations in valence and conduction bands! can
then be solved self-consistently, imposing charge neutrality.
The solution of this problem amounts to ﬁnding the root of a
polynomial with x5exp(2EF/kT) as the variable.16
The notion of calculating point defect concentrations as
a function of environmental conditions is, of course, not new.
Kro
¨ger developed an elaborate formalism and applied it to
many solids.67 The formalism described here differs from
Kro
¨ger’s approach in three major ways: ~1! Instead of work-
ing with mass-action relations, which always relate to spe-
ciﬁc defect reactions and thus involve pairs of defects, we
write down equations for formation energies @Eq. ~2!# for
each defect individually. This greatly simpliﬁes the formal-
ism, makes it more transparent, and still allows for obtaining
a self-consistent solution for all the coupled equations, as
described above. ~2! Instead of working with partial pres-
sures, we prefer to work with chemical potentials, as de-
scribed in Sec. II E 1. Again, this renders the formalism more
transparent and also allows us to clearly identify the effect of
an abundance of certain species in the environment, even if
equilibration with a gas outside the material cannot be as-
sumed. As discussed in Ref. 31, the use of chemical poten-
tials as variables also results in a reduction of the number of
free parameters required to represent a phase diagram. ~3!
Last but not least, the availability of ﬁrst-principles calcula-
tions to evaluate the key parameters provides us with an
enormous advantage over Kro
¨ger, who had to infer the value
of crucial parameters from limited experimental information.
This process often involved serious assumptions, which in
turn could affect the results in uncontrolled ways. The unbi-
ased, systematic results for all potential defects provided by
state-of-the-art calculations allow us to approach defect
problems truly from ﬁrst principles.
Rather than just showing results for defect concentra-
tions, it is often very instructive to plot formation energies as
a function of EF in order to examine the behavior of defects
and impurities when the doping level changes. For clarity of

presentation the atomic chemical potentials may be set equal
to ﬁxed values; a general case can always be addressed by
referring back to Eq. ~2!. We will see that the dependence of
formation energies on Fermi level provides immediate in-
sight into the electrical activity ~donor or acceptor character!
of a defect or impurity, the position of its charge transfer
level, and the potential behavior of certain defects as com-
pensating centers.
C. Charge states
Most point defects and impurities can occur in multiple
charge states. As shown in Eq. ~2!, the formation energy
depends on the charge state. Formation energies have to be
calculated for each relevant charge state. The stable charge
state is then the one which has the lowest formation energy
for a given Fermi level.
Equation ~2! shows that the formation energy of charged
impurities takes into account that electrons are exchanged
with the Fermi level. The Fermi level EF is referenced with
respect to the valence-band maximum in the bulk, i.e., EF
50 at the top of the valence band (Ev) in bulk GaN. A
problem when calculating Ev is that in a supercell approach
the defect or impurity strongly affects the band structure. We
therefore cannot simply use Ev as calculated in the defect
supercell. To solve this problem a two-step procedure is
used: ~i! The top of the valence band Ev is calculated in bulk
GaN by performing a band-structure calculation at the G
point and ~ii! an alignment procedure is used in order to align
the electrostatic potentials between the defect supercell and
the bulk.
The fact that Ev found for the bulk ~e.g., in a defect-free
supercell! cannot be directly applied to the supercell with
defect can be attributed to the long-range nature of the Cou-
lomb potential and the periodic boundary conditions inherent
in the supercell approach. The creation of the defect gives
rise to a constant shift in the potential, and this shift cannot
be evaluated from supercell calculations alone since no ab-
solute reference exists for the electrostatic potential in peri-
odic structures. The problem is similar to that of calculating
heterojunction band offsets,68 and similar techniques can be
used to address these issues.16 Our preferred method is to
align the electrostatic potentials by inspecting the potential in
the supercell far from the impurity and aligning it with the
electrostatic potential in bulk GaN. This leads to a shift in the
reference level DV, which needs to be added to Ev in order
to obtain the correct alignment. The resulting shifts are taken
into account in our expressions for formation energies in Sec.
II B 4.
Another issue regarding calculations for charged states is
the treatment of the G50 term in the total energy of the
supercell. This term would diverge for a charged system; we
therefore assume the presence of a compensating uniform
background ~jellium! and evaluate the G50 term as if the
system were neutral.59 Makov and Payne69 have pointed out
that the energy of this cell will converge very slowly as a
function of supercell size, due to the electrostatic interactions
between the periodic array of monopoles, which converge
only as 1/eL ~where L is the linear dimension of the super-
cell and e is the static dielectric constant!. Makov and Payne
proposed to add a correction term ~essentially the Madelung
energy of a lattice of point charges in a dielectric environ-
ment! that would lead to a better estimate of the energy of a
single isolated defect. Note that since this term scales as q2,
it can become quite sizeable for more highly charged sys-
tems.
While the Makov–Payne approach works well for
atomic or molecular systems calculated in otherwise empty
supercells, it has been found to lead to an overestimate of the
correction term for defects in semiconductors.66,70 An indis-
criminate application of the Makov–Payne correction may
not necessarily yield a better approximation of the total en-
ergy for an isolated defect. The reason has been proposed to
be the improved screening that takes place around the defect
within the supercell, which effectively reduces the strength
of the interactions between defects in neighboring cells. The
conclusions of Schwarz66 were based on calculations for
GaAs, and it remains to be seen whether they also apply to
GaN ~which has a smaller dielectric constant!. For now,
since more work is clearly needed to better understand these
corrections, we refrain from applying them, and the results
reported below do not include them.
D. Electronic structure
1. Thermodynamic transition levels versus optical
levels
Point defects and impurities almost always introduce
levels in the band gap of the semiconductor or near the band
edges. The experimental detection of these levels often forms
the basis for the identiﬁcation of the defect or impurity. Cal-
culation of these levels is therefore an important priority. The
levels that are of experimental relevance always involve tran-
sitions between different charge states of the center. This
means that the Kohn–Sham levels that result from a band-
structure calculation for the center cannot directly be identi-
ﬁed with any levels that are relevant for experiment.
The thermodynamic transition level e(q1 /q2) is deﬁned
as the Fermi-level position where charge states q1 and q2
have equal energy. As the name implies, this level would be
observed in experiments where the ﬁnal charge state can
fully relax to its equilibrium conﬁguration after the transi-
tion. This type of level is therefore what is observed in DLTS
~deep-level transient spectroscopy! experiments, or, in the
case of shallow centers, corresponds to the thermal ioniza-
tion energy, as would be derived from an analysis of
temperature-dependent Hall data.
Let us illustrate this concept for the case of a shallow
acceptor, such as MgGa , in GaN. The relevant charge states
here are q150 and q2521, and the thermodynamic transi-
tion level e(0/2) is usually called the thermal ionization
energy or the acceptor ionization energy EA . By deﬁnition

For purposes of deﬁning the thermal ionization energy, it is
implied that for each charge state the atomic structure is
relaxed to its equilibrium conﬁguration. The atomic positions
in these equilibrium conﬁgurations are not necessarily the
same for both charge states. Indeed, it is precisely this dif-
ference in relaxation that leads to the difference between
thermodynamic transition levels and optical levels.
The optical level eopt(q1 /q2) associated with a transition
between charge states q1 and q2 is deﬁned similarly to the
thermodynamic transition level, but now the energy of the
ﬁnal state q2 is calculated using the atomic conﬁguration of
the initial state q1 . The optical level would be observed in
experiments where the ﬁnal charge state cannot relax to its
equilibrium conﬁguration after the transition. This type of
level is therefore what is observed, for instance, in photolu-
minescence experiments. Indeed, it is informative to consider
the following simpliﬁed picture of a photoluminescence ex-
periment, again illustrated for the speciﬁc example of a Mg
acceptor: The exciting light creates electron-hole pairs. The
holes can be trapped at MgGa
2 centers, turning them into
MgGa
0 . Using our deﬁnition of the thermal ionization energy
EA , the equilibrium conﬁguration of the MgGa
0 1e state
~where e is an electron at the bottom of the conduction band!
is Eg2EA higher than the equilibrium conﬁguration of
MgGa
2 , where Eg is the band gap.
Electrons in the conduction band can then recombine
with the hole on the acceptor, as illustrated in Fig. 2. This
leads to emission of a photon with energy EPL . During this
emission process, the atomic conﬁguration of the acceptor
remains ﬁxed–i.e., in the ﬁnal state, the acceptor is in the
negative charge state, but with a structure ~conﬁguration co-
ordinate q0) that is the same as that for the neutral charge
state. The difference between the energy of this conﬁguration
and that of the equilibrium conﬁguration q2 is the relaxation
energy Erel ~the Franck–Condon shift!. Figure 2 shows that
EPL5Eg2EA2Erel. If the optical ionization energy, EA
opt is
deﬁned as the energy difference between the band gap and
the PL line, we ﬁnd that EA
opt5Eg2EPL5EA1Erel. This
simpliﬁed picture ignores excitonic effects, etc., but it does
show that the ionization energy extracted from an optical
measurement should be larger than the thermal ionization
energy EA by an amount Erel. If the atomic conﬁguration in
the two charge states is signiﬁcantly different, Erel can be
sizable.
2. Conﬁguration coordinate diagrams
Conﬁguration coordinate diagrams can be very useful in
discussing and analyzing the energetics of impurities in dif-
ferent charge states. In fact, we have already employed a
conﬁguration coordinate diagram in this review, in the con-
text of our discussion of optical ionization energies in Sec.
II D 1. Underlying the idea of the conﬁguration coordinate
diagram is the notion that the energy of the defect or impu-
rity depends on its atomic conﬁguration. In many cases, one
can identify a single coordinate ~or generalized coordinate!
that plays the dominant role in the energetics. This could, for
instance, be the magnitude of the breathing relaxation ~rel-
evant, e.g., for a nitrogen vacancy, where the surrounding Ga
atoms can undergo large displacements!; or the magnitude of
the off-center displacement of an impurity along a speciﬁc
direction ~relevant, e.g., for oxygen in AlGaN or in GaN
under pressure, which forms a DX center; see Fig. 3 and Sec.
IV A 1!.
The energy of the center, in a speciﬁc charge state, can
be plotted as a function of this coordinate. In schematic ﬁg-
ures, this dependence is often shown to be parabolic; indeed,
FIG. 2. Schematic conﬁguration coordinate diagram illustrating the differ-
ence between thermal and optical ionization energies for an acceptor A. The
curve for A0 is vertically displaced from that for A2 assuming the presence
of an electron in the conduction band. Erel is the Franck–Condon shift, i.e.,
the relaxation energy that can be gained, in the negative charge state, by
relaxing from conﬁguration q0 ~equilibrium conﬁguration for the neutral
charge states! to conﬁguration q2 ~equilibrium conﬁguration for the nega-
tive charge state!. Conﬁguration coordinate diagrams are discussed in Sec.
II D 2.

center in wurtzite AlN, showing formation energies for an impurity in the
neutral ~open circles! and negative ~closed circles! charge states as a func-
tion of displacement along @0001#. The Fermi level is assumed to be located
at the bottom of the conduction band, and the zero of energy corresponds to
the formation energy of the neutral charge state at the substitutional site. The
lines are a guide to the eye. U is the energy gain due to DX center forma-
tion. Eopt is the optical ionization energy. Ec and Ee are capture and emis-
sion barriers for electrons. From Ref. 14.

elastic restoring forces cause the energy to depend quadrati-
cally on displacement for small displacements. However,
ﬁrst-principles calculations allow us to explicitly calculate
this dependence without making any additional approxima-
tions. Both our examples ~Figs. 2 and 3! show that the coor-
dinate value for which the minimum in the total energy oc-
curs can be different in different charge states. In the case of
the DX center, this forms the central feature of the metasta-
bility of the center.
By plotting the dependence of energy on coordinate for
two different charge states, one can gain immediate insight in
the various processes and their energetics that can be ob-
served experimentally. For instance, Fig. 3 illustrates that U
is the thermodynamic energy gain due to DX center forma-
tion; Eopt is the optical ionization energy ~no relaxation of
the ﬁnal state allowed!; and Ec and Ee are capture and emis-
sion barriers for electrons.
3. Deep levels versus shallow levels
In the case of a shallow acceptor the level introduced in
the Kohn–Sham band structure due to the presence of the
impurity is merely a perturbation of the host band structure.
This ‘‘acceptor level’’ therefore exhibits essentially the same
dispersion as the uppermost valence band. In the negative
charge state, the acceptor level is ﬁlled–but in the neutral
charge state, one electron is removed from this level. For a
true, isolated acceptor ~corresponding to a calculation in a
very large supercell!, the electron would be removed from
the top of the valence band, at the G point. But in our ﬁnite-
size supercells, the electron is actually taken out of the high-
est occupied Kohn–Sham level at the special k points, where
the band energy is lower than at the G point. A correction is
therefore needed, obtained from the energy differences be-
tween the highest occupied state at the G point and the spe-
cial k points. The magnitude of this correction can be size-
able; for substitutional Be in GaN it was found to range from
;0.2 eV in a 96-atom cell to ;0.5 eV in a 32-atom cell.64
This correction term, which we call Ecorr and which has been
deﬁned as a positive number, needs to be taken into account
in all results for neutral acceptors.71 A similar correction is
needed for shallow donors: Ecorr is then the difference be-
tween the lowest occupied state at the G point and the special
k points.
E. Chemical potentials
1. Boundaries and range
The chemical potentials depend on the experimental
growth conditions, which can be Ga-rich or N-rich ~or any-
thing in between!. They should therefore be explicitly re-
garded as variable in our formalism. However, it is possible
to place ﬁrm bounds on the chemical potentials; these
bounds will prove very useful in interpreting the results.
The Ga chemical potential, mGa , is subject to an upper
bound: under extreme Ga-rich conditions, mGa5mGa[bulk] .
Indeed, in thermodynamic equilibrium the Ga chemical po-
tential cannot be higher than the energy of bulk Ga. If we
tried to push it higher, than we would no longer be growing
GaN, but instead precipitating bulk Ga. This is indeed what
is experimentally observed: MBE growth of GaN is often
carried out under Ga-rich conditions, and precipation of Ga
on the growing surface can be explicitly observed.72,73
Similarly, extreme N-rich conditions place an upper limit
on mN given by mN5mN[N2] , i.e., the energy of N in a N2
molecule. It should be kept in mind that these chemical po-
tentials, which are free energies, are temperature and pres-
sure dependent.
In addition to the upper bounds deﬁned above, we can
also impose lower bounds, using the following expression:
mGa1mN5Etot@GaN#,
~7!
where Etot@GaN# is the total energy of a two-atom unit of
bulk GaN. The upper limit on mGa then results in a lower
limit on mN
mN
min5Etot@GaN#2mGa[bulk] .
~8!
Similarly, the upper limit on mN results in a lower limit on
mGa
mGa
min5Etot@GaN#2mN[N2] .
~9!
The total energy of GaN can also be expressed as
Etot@GaN#5mGa[bulk]1mN[N2]1DH f@GaN#,
~10!
where DH f@GaN# is the enthalpy of formation, which is
negative for a stable compound. Our calculated value for
DH f@GaN# is 21.24 eV ~including the 3d states as valence
states! or 20.48 eV ~using the nlcc); the experimental value
is 21.17 eV.74 By combining Eq. ~8! or Eq. ~9! with Eq.
~10! we observe that the host chemical potentials thus vary
over a range corresponding to the magnitude of the enthalpy
of formation of GaN.
The chemical potentials can in principle be related to
partial pressures, using standard thermodynamic expressions.
For instance, the chemical potential for hydrogen atoms in a
gas of H2 molecules is given by
2mH5EH21kTFlnS
pVQ
kT D 2ln Zrot2ln ZvibG,
~11!
where EH2 is the energy of an H2 molecule, k is the Boltz-
mann constant, T is the temperature, and p is the pressure.
VQ5(h2/2pmkT)3/2 is the quantum volume, and Zrot and
Zvib are the rotational and vibrational partition functions.
When using such expressions for the chemical potentials one
should be careful to verify that equilibrium conditions apply.
For instance, when a material is annealed at high temperature
under an overpressure of a certain element, it may be appro-
priate to relate the chemical potential of that element to the
partial pressure of the gas, provided the diffusivity of the
species in the solid is high enough to ensure equilibration
between defects inside the solid and the gas outside. Simi-
larly, MOCVD growth at high temperatures may be close
enough to equilibrium to allow relating the chemical poten-
tials relevant for defect and impurity incorporation to the
partial pressures of the ﬂowing gases. A clear counterexam-
ple is provided by MBE growth: there, no equilibrium can be
assumed between the species in the molecular beam and the
species inside the growing solid. It therefore would not make

sense to relate the chemical potentials relevant for defects
and impurities to a partial pressure in the molecular beam.
2. Impurity solubility
For impurities we also need to consider the correspond-
ing elemental chemical potential mX . The lower bound on
mX is minus inﬁnity, corresponding to the total absence of
the impurity from the growth environment. An upper bound
on the impurity chemical potential is given by the energy of
the elemental bulk phase. However, stronger bounds usually
arise due to formation of other solubility-limiting phases. For
instance, when Mg is being incorporated in GaN, the Mg can
interact with N and form Mg3N2 . Equilibrium with Mg3N2
implies
3mMg12mN53mMg[bulk]12mN[N2]1DH f@Mg3N2#,
~12!
where DH f@Mg3N2# is the enthalpy of formation of Mg3N2 .
Equation ~12! allows us to relate mMg to mN , assuming equi-
librium with Mg3N2 . Combining this information with the
expression for the formation energy of MgGa @Eq. ~3!#, we
ﬁnd that the lowest formation energy ~and hence the highest
concentration of MgGa, i.e., the solubility limit! occurs under
nitrogen-rich conditions, i.e., when mN5mN[N2] . This may
seem obvious, since N-rich conditions indeed make it easier
for Mg to be incorporated on a substitutional Ga site. The
situation is not always this obvious, however. For instance,
when incorporating Si into GaN, the maximum solubility is
achieved under Ga-rich conditions–in spite of the fact that
the substitutional Si donor also incorporates on a Ga site.
The reason is that in the case of GaN:Si the solubility-
limiting phase is Si3N4 . Nitrogen-rich conditions, which
would make it easier for Si to incorporate on a Ga site,
promote the formation of Si3N4 , thereby suppressing the
solubility. The net effect is that Ga-rich conditions are more
favorable.75
F. Complexes
So far we have implicitly discussed isolated impurities
and point defects. It is possible, of course, for defects and
impurities to agglomerate and form complexes. The simplest
situation is a complex AB consisting of two constituents, A
and B. The chemical reaction to form the complex is
A1B⇔AB;~Eb!,
~13!
where Eb is the energy gained by this reaction. This binding
energy Eb between the constituents can be deﬁned in terms
of the formation energies
Eb5E f~A!1E f~B!2E f~AB!,
~14!
where the sign has been chosen such that a positive binding
energy corresponds to a stable, bound complex.
Merely having a positive binding energy does not imply
that a complex will necessarily form. Consider, for instance,
the situation where the incorporation of the constituents, as
well as the complex, is governed by thermal equilibrium at
the growth temperature. In order for the concentration of
complexes to be larger than that of either constituent, its
formation energy should be lower than both E f(A) and
E f(B). This immediately implies that the binding energy Eb
needs to be greater than the larger of E f(A) and E f(B). In
other words, unless the binding energy of the complex is
large on the scale of the formation energy of the constituents,
its concentration will be small. The reason is that complexes
generally have a much smaller conﬁgurational entropy. For
example, a complex consisting of two constituents can be
formed in NsitesNconﬁg conﬁgurations @see Eq. ~1!# whereas if
the two constituents are independently formed they can be
created in }Nsites
2
conﬁgurations. Thus, to discuss complex
formation it is not sufﬁcient to look at the complex binding
energy but also at the conﬁgurational entropy.
Formation of complexes does not always occur under
equilibrium conditions, however. A typical situation occurs
when one of the constituents is incorporated and essentially
‘‘frozen in’’ during the growth process, and complex forma-
tion occurs only during the subsequent cooldown. Let us
give a speciﬁc example, namely, formation of Mg–H com-
plexes in GaN. The Mg concentration is essentially deter-
mined at the growth temperature. As we will see in Sec.
IV C 2, the binding energy of the Mg–H complex is signiﬁ-
cantly smaller than a typical formation energy of the Mg
acceptor. Therefore the concentration of Mg–H complexes at
the growth temperature is small compared to the Mg concen-
tration. Complexes can form during cooldown, however. A
supply of hydrogen is available because hydrogen was incor-
porated during the growth, or because a reservoir of hydro-
gen is still available outside the crystal. These hydrogen at-
oms are highly mobile and can become bound at the
substitutional Mg atoms. At sufﬁciently high temperatures
these complexes can also dissociate, but once the tempera-
ture is lowered below a certain value any complexes that
form will be stable.
Let us illustrate these issues with a speciﬁc scenario. We
consider the complex AB consisting of two constituents A
and B which can undergo the chemical reaction described in
Eq. ~13!. The complex formation can be described by the
following mass-action law:
cA3cB
cAB

exp~2Eb /kT!,
~15!
where cA , cB , and cAB are the respective concentrations. Let
us ﬁrst consider the case where cA and cB are equilibrium
concentrations
according
to
Eq.
~1!.
Then
cA5Nsites
3exp@2Ef(A)/kT#
and
cB5Nsites exp@2Ef(B)/kT#.
Using
these relations together with Eq. ~15! yields

Using Eq. ~14! the above equation reproduces the con-
centration
of

complexes:

Let us now consider the case where the number of de-
fects A and B are ﬁxed but where at least one of the constitu-

ents is sufﬁciently mobile to realize local equilibrium ac-
cording to Eq. ~13!. We can then solve Eq. ~15! using the
condition that cA
tot5cA1cAB and cB
tot5cB1cAB are kept ﬁxed.
In this case, decreasing the temperature leads to an increase
in the number of complexes AB and a decrease in the num-
ber of isolated defects A and B. To be speciﬁc let us apply
this to the case where the constituents are Mg2 and H1, as
already mentioned above. Charge neutrality requires that
both are formed in roughly the same concentration @cMg2
'cH1# ~assuming that the Fermi level is far enough from the
band edges to lead to negligibly small free-carrier concentra-
tions!. Their formation energies must therefore be the same,
i.e., E f(Mg2)'E f(H1). As we will see in Sec. IV B 1, ﬁrst-
principles
calculations
show
that
E f(Mg2)'E f(H1)
'1 eV.76 The binding energy of the Mg–H complex is Eb
50.7 eV.76 Let us further assume that during growth (T
'1300 K) the impurity concentration is in thermodynamic
equilibrium and that after growth the sample is cooled down
in a fashion that keeps the impurity concentration constant
~i.e., the total numbers of Mg and H atoms are kept ﬁxed to
their values at the growth temperature!. The resulting tem-
perature dependence of the complex concentration cAB ~ex-
pressed with respect to the total number of atoms of type A,
which is being held constant! is shown in Fig. 4. The ﬁgure
shows that at the growth temperature the complex concentra-
tion is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the
impurity concentration. However, as the temperature is re-
duced the complex concentration rises, and below about 500
K only complexes will be formed. In contrast, if the concen-
trations of A, B, and AB were all determined by thermal
equilibrium at each temperature, the ratio of cAB to cA
tot
would be signiﬁcantly smaller. Freezing in the defect or im-
purity concentration thus signiﬁcantly enhances complex for-
mation, leading to concentrations of complexes signiﬁcantly
higher than what might be expected from equilibrium argu-
ments.
G. Diffusion
An important question when studying defect concentra-
tions is to specify whether the system is in thermodynamic
equilibrium or whether it is governed by kinetic processes.
Generally, the system will be in thermodynamic equilibrium
if the defects are sufﬁciently mobile to follow and eliminate
gradients in the corresponding chemical potential. Calcula-
tions of diffusivities of point defects in the nitrides have only
recently been performed.24
A powerful tool to study and analyze the mobility of a
defect is the calculation of total energy surfaces. Such sur-
faces provide direct insight into stable conﬁgurations and
migration paths, and they show the location of saddle points,
providing values for migration barriers. Total energy surfaces
are also useful for identifying spatial locations where addi-
tional local minima ~metastable conﬁgurations! might occur.
We illustrate these concepts by considering the behavior
of an interstitial impurity Xi . In order to construct the cor-
responding total energy surface, we calculate the total energy
of Xi at various locations in the lattice. For each position of
Xi , the surrounding host atoms are allowed to relax, result-
ing in an adiabatic total energy surface. The resulting energy
values as a function of the coordinates of the Xi position,
RXi, deﬁne the potential energy surface: E5E(RXi). The
energy surface is therefore a function of three spatial dimen-
sions. In order to obtain accurate results, a database of en-
ergy values ~for a sufﬁcently large number of spatial coordi-
nates! is needed.
Symmetry can be used in the calculation and visualiza-
tion of the total energy surface.59 We only need to calculate
positions in the irreducible portion of the unit cell. The cho-
sen locations are typically not equally spaced in the crystal,
because it is better to increase the density of points near
important locations such as local minima and saddle points.
Since the energy surface is a function of RXi, it possesses the
full symmetry of the crystal. To make effective use of these
symmetries, an analytic description of the surface is essen-
tial. This can be achieved through expansion in a basis set
with the appropriate symmetry. A ﬁtting of the total-energy
results ~including the atomic forces! to this set of basis func-
tions is then performed, using a least-squares method. As
basis functions, one can use symmetrized plane waves that
reﬂect the full symmetry of the crystal ~zinc blende or wurtz-
ite!. One can also make use of the physical fact that the
interstitial impurity can never approach any host atom too
closely ~exchange processes, which would carry a very high
energy cost, are not included in the total energy surface!. To
this end, some high-energy values near the host atoms can be
added to the calculated data set; these additions does not
affect the shape of the energy surface in the relevant regions
away from the atoms.
Since the energy surface is a function of three spatial
dimensions, it is difﬁcult to present the results in a single
plot. For visualization purposes, we need to show a cut of the
energy surface, restricting the coordinates to a single plane.
Judicious choice of such planes ensures we convey all the
essential information, i.e., stable and metastable sites as well
as barriers between them. For GaN, the ~11–20! and ~0001!
FIG. 4. Ratio of the concentration of complexes AB ~Mg–H, in the current
example! to the total concentration of A ~hydrogen! as a function of tem-
perature. The dash-dotted line represents thermal equilibrium conditions,
while the solid line represents results in the event that the total concentra-
tions of A ~hydrogen! and B ~magnesium! are determined by thermal equi-
librium at the growth temperature ~1300 K! and kept ﬁxed during cooldown.
The formation energies of A and B are taken to be 1 eV, and the binding
energy Eb is 0.7 eV, values that apply to the case of Mg–H complexes in
GaN. The concentration ratio cAB /cA
tot is small at the growth temperature but
rises rapidly as the temperature is lowered for the case where the total
concentrations of A and B are kept ﬁxed.

planes are good choices. The energy surface can then be
displayed as a contour plot or as a perspective plot of the
energy ~along the z-axis! as a function of coordinates in the
plane.
H. Direct comparison with experiment
The ﬁrst-principles calculations described above can be
used to predict experimental results, and also to help inter-
pret experimental observations. It is often desirable to be
able to perform a direct comparison between calculated and
measured quantities. Such a comparison can be used, for
instance, to identify the chemical nature or microscopic
structure of a defect. Here we mention two examples that
have proven particularly useful for defect studies.
1. Calculation of hyperﬁne parameters
The ﬁrst-principles calculations provide explicit infor-
mation about the wave functions in the system; it is therefore
possible to calculate hyperﬁne parameters, which can be di-
rectly compared with the quantities measured by electron
paramagnetic resonance. The wave functions have to be ob-
tained from a calculation that explicitly includes spin polar-
ization; i.e., spin-up and spin-down electrons have to be
treated independently. It has been shown that it is very im-
portant to take contributions to the spin density from all the
occupied states into account. One might assume that it would
sufﬁce to only include the wave function of the unpaired
electron in the calculation of hyperﬁne parameters, but po-
larization of the valence states can strongly affect the result;
for hydrogen impurities in Si, the difference was as large as
a factor of two.77
Hyperﬁne parameters are particularly sensitive to the
wave functions in the core region. When using a pseudopo-
tential approach, the wave function in the core region is re-
placed by a smooth pseudowave function. It has been dem-
onstrated that the information contained in the pseudowave
function, in conjunction with information about wave func-
tions in the free atom, is sufﬁcient to calculate hyperﬁne
parameters with a high degree of accuracy. The formalism is
described in detail in Ref. 77.
The experimental observation of hyperﬁne signals usu-
ally provides some information about the chemical identity
of the atoms in the vicinity of the defect, as well as about the
symmetry. The ability to directly compare with calculated
values for speciﬁc defect conﬁgurations then allows an ex-
plicit identiﬁcation of the microscopic structure. Examples
can be found in Ref. 77.
2. Calculation of vibrational frequencies
Defects or impurities often give rise to localized vibra-
tional modes ~LVM!. Light impurities, in particular, exhibit
distinct LVMs that are often well above the bulk phonon
spectrum. The value of the observed frequency often pro-
vides some indication as to the chemical nature of the atoms
involved in the bond, but a direct comparison with ﬁrst-
principles calculations can be very valuable.
Evaluating the vibrational frequency corresponding to a
stretching or wagging mode of a particular bond can be ac-
complished by using calculated forces to construct a dynami-
cal matrix. In the case of light impurities, where a large mass
difference exists between the impurity and the surrounding
atoms, it is often a good approximation to focus on the dis-
placement of the light impurity only, keeping all other atoms
ﬁxed. A ﬁt to the calculated energies as a function of dis-
placement then produces a force constant. This approach ac-
tually lends itself very well to taking higher-order terms ~an-
harmonic corrections! into account. In the case of an
impurity such as hydrogen the anharmonic terms can be on
the order of several 100 cm21, so an accurate treatment is
required. The formalism has been described in Ref. 78, and
applications to LVMs in nitrides are detailed in Refs. 79 and
80.
3. Calculation of charge transfer levels
The calculation of charge transfer levels was discussed
in Sec. II D 1. Thermodynamic transition levels can be de-
rived from experiments such as DLTS or temperature-
dependent Hall measurements, while optical levels would be
observed in photoluminescence. Comparisons with experi-
ment should be carried out judiciously. For instance, the er-
ror in the LDA band gap may obviously affect the results. In
the case of shallow levels the results are best expressed by
referencing them to the valence-band maximum for accep-
tors, and to the conduction-band minimum for electrons. For
deep levels, it is also often possible to determine whether the
states have predominantly valence-band or conduction-band
character, as discussed in the case of InN in Ref. 51. Levels
that are valence-band derived ~for instance, the anion dan-
gling bonds in the case of a cation vacancy! are likely to be
only modestly affected by band-gap corrections, while levels
that are conduction-band derived ~for instance, the cation
dangling bonds in an anion vacancy! will likely shift up with
the conduction band when band-gap corrections are applied.
I. Accuracy
It is appropriate to ask what the error bar is on the cal-
culated formation energies. One component of the error is a
purely numerical error bar, associated with the choice of su-
percell size, plane-wave-energy cutoff, and k-point sampling.
The magnitude of this error can be estimated simply by in-
creasing the level of convergence. Well-converged calcula-
tions, of the type that will be reported in Secs. III and IV,
have numerical error bars that are smaller than 0.1 eV. Ac-
curacies better than 0.01 eV can be achieved in cases where
it is considered important, for instance when taking energy
differences between conﬁgurations of a speciﬁc defect in a
single charge state ~for which other types of errors discussed
below would systematically cancel!.
Another type of error that, in principle, could be explic-
itly checked by increasing the supercell size is the one
caused by the electrostatic interactions between charged de-
fects induced by the periodic boundary conditions, as dis-
cussed in Sec. II C. Unfortunately, the large cell sizes that
would be required to perform these checks often pose unrea-
sonable computational demands. This emphasizes the need
for a reliable method to correct for these interactions. We
estimate that for 11 or 12 charge states in 96-atom nitride

supercells this error is on the order of 0.1 eV; however, it
may become more important for higher charge states.
Another type of error could potentially be associated
with the use of pseudopotentials. Explicit comparisons with
all-electron calculations have shown, however, that the use
of pseudopotentials produces highly accurate results ~see,
e.g., Ref. 41!.
That leaves us with one remaining source of error,
namely, density-functional theory itself, as discussed in Sec.
II B 3. The magnitude of this error depends on how many
electrons reside in defect-related states, and whether those
states are affected by the band-gap error. As discussed in Ref.
51, a qualitative picture based on the physics of the defect
states can often be very illuminating. For instance, one ex-
pects the defect states associated with a cation vacancy in a
III–N semiconductor to be derived from nitrogen dangling
bonds, which have valence-band character and are hence un-
likely to shift signiﬁcantly when the band gap is corrected.
Therefore, a correction of the band gap is expected to have
no signiﬁcant effect on the formation energy, since the en-
ergy of electrons residing in those defect states remains
largely unchanged.
Many cases where accuracy is important involve com-
parison of energies of conﬁgurations where the number of
atoms and the charge state are kept ﬁxed. In that case the
systematic errors due to charge-state effects or due to
density-functional theory cancel, and the accuracy is deter-
mined by the numerical error bar, as discussed above. An
important example would be the calculation of migration
barriers, which involve the energy difference between the
ground state and the saddle point.
Other types of calculated quantities exhibit larger error
bars. For instance, transition levels ~see Sec. II D 1! are en-
ergy differences between different charge states, and hence
unavoidably reﬂect the errors due to electrostatic interactions
and due to the band-gap error. A conservative error bar of at
least several 0.1 eV should always be assumed.
III. NATIVE POINT DEFECTS
A. Formation energies
First-principles calculations for native point defects in
GaN have been reported by several groups. The most com-
prehensive calculations, for all types of defects and charge
states, were reported in Ref. 17. Bogusławski et al.81 also
performed calculations for all defects, but did not explicitly
report formation energies. They seem to have focused on
neutral charge states. Their results are qualitatively similar to
those of Ref. 17, although some differences were evident in
the interpretation of those results. To the extent that quanti-
tative differences occur they can probably be attributed to the
use of the G point in the Brillouin-zone integrations, and the
neglect of Ga d states in the calculations of Ref. 81. Studies
for vacancies were also reported in Ref. 82, by Mattila
et al.,83 by Mattila and Nieminen,84 and neutral defects were
investigated by Gorczyca et al.62 The formation energies of
most of the defects are quite similar in zinc-blende and
wurtzite; where exceptions occur they will be explicitly
ﬂagged.
Formation energies for all native point defects in GaN,
in all relevant charge states, are shown in Fig. 5. These re-
sults were obtained from ﬁrst-principles calculations;17,75,82
some of the values in Fig. 5 may differ from the earlier
publications due to the fact that calculations for vacancies
and self-interstitials were updated using 96-atom super-
cells.24 For each charge state of each defect Fig. 5 displays
only the line segment that gives rise to the overall lowest
energy. Thus, a change in slope of the lines represents a
change in the charge state of the defect. The corresponding
thermodynamic transition levels, as deﬁned in Sec. II D 1, are
illustrated in Fig. 6. Antisites are not included in Fig. 6 be-

defects in GaN. Ga-rich conditions are assumed. The zero of Fermi level
corresponds to the top of the valence band. Only segments corresponding to
the lowest-energy charge states are shown. The slope of these segments
indicates the charge state. Kinks in the curves indicate transitions between
different charge states.

cause we will see that they are unlikely to ever play any role
in GaN. We refer to Sec. II I for a discussion of the error bars
on the quantities displayed in Figs. 5 and 6.
Before discussing the defects in detail, we point out
some general trends. Figure 5 shows that self-interstitial and
antisite defects are high-energy defects in GaN, and are thus
unlikely to occur during growth. These defects may still be
created under nonequilibrium conditions, of course, for in-
stance by electron irradiation or ion implantation. Self-
interstitials ~along with vacancies! may also play a role in
high-temperature diffusion. Overall, however, only vacancies
have low enough energies to be present in signiﬁcant con-
centrations in GaN. It is also evident from Fig. 5 that the
neutral charge states have signiﬁcantly higher energies than
other charge states. An investigation limited only to neutral
charge states would therefore not produce a reliable picture
of defect formation.
B. Nitrogen vacancies
Nitrogen vacancies (VN) behave as shallow donors in
GaN ~notice the dependence on Fermi energy in Fig. 5; an
increase of formation energy with EF is indicative of do-
nors!. When purposely created, for instance during irradia-
tion or ion implantation, nitrogen vacancies will increase the
electron concentration.85 However, their high formation en-
ergy under n-type conditions makes it very unlikely that ni-
trogen vacancies would form spontaneously during growth
of not-intentionally doped GaN, and hence they cannot be
responsible for n-type conductivity.
This conclusion contradicted the conventional wisdom in
the nitride community, where for almost 25 years the n-type
‘‘autodoping’’ of GaN had commonly attributed to the nitro-
gen vacancy.86,87 Of course it also raised the question of what
the actual source was of the observed n-type conductivity in
not-intentionally
doped
GaN.
Based
on
ﬁrst-principles
calculations,17,88 it was proposed that unintentional incorpo-
ration of oxygen could explain the conductivity. This possi-
bility had previously been raised in a couple of experimental
papers.89,90 It has now become well accepted that impurities
are responsible for the unintentional conductivity, and in par-
ticular the role of oxygen has been studied in great detail, as
discussed below.
We note that Fig. 5 does show that nitrogen vacancies
have a low formation energy in p-type GaN, making them a
likely compensating center in the case of acceptor doping.
The electronic structure of the nitrogen vacancy shows a
s-like a1 state lying close to the valence-band maximum, and
p-like t2 states above the conduction-band minimum. The
latter are degenerate in the case of zinc-blende GaN, but are
split into a singlet and a doublet state in the wurtzite struc-
ture. In the neutral charge state one electron would be placed
in the t2 states, but because these are resonant with the con-
duction band this electron is transferred to the lower-lying
conduction-band minimum; this cause the nitrogen vacancy
to act as a shallow donor, consistent with experiment.85
This result qualitatively differs from previous tight-
binding ~TB! calculations.32,33 The main difference is the un-
usually large splitting between the a1 and t2 defect levels
which is not correctly reproduced in the TB calculations.
This large splitting originates from a peculiar property of
GaN: due to the much smaller size of the nitrogen atoms
compared to the Ga atoms, the Ga–Ga distance in GaN is
comparable to that in bulk Ga, resulting in metalliclike bonds
between the Ga atoms surrounding the nitrogen vacancy.17
This strong interaction between the Ga atoms, which are
second-nearest neighbors, explains the large splitting of the
a1 and t2 defect levels. It also explains the failing of tight-
binding calculations in which mainly ﬁrst-nearest neighbor
interactions are taken into account.
The atomic structure of the nitrogen vacancy is charac-
terized by a small outward breathing relaxation, by about 4%
of the bond length.24 In the wurtzite structure the four Ga
neighbors can be divided into three equivalent atoms lying in
a plane perpendicular to the c axis and one inequivalent Ga
atom located along the c axis above the defect. The differ-
ences in relaxation among the inequivalent directions are
small.
Figure 5 shows that for Fermi levels close to the VBM a
charge state other than the single positive charge state is
more stable. The occurrence of the 31 charge state is asso-
ciated with a large breathing relaxation, in which the neigh-
boring Ga atoms move outward by almost 15% of the bond
length.24 We note that the 21 charge state is never stable;
this is characteristic of a negative-U impurity, which is usu-
ally associated with a strikingly large lattice relaxation of
one of the charge states ~here 31). The origin of the stability
of the 31 charge state is similar to what was observed by
Northrup and Zhang for the As vacancy in GaAs91 and by
Garcia and Northrup for the Se vacancy in ZnSe:92 A large
outward relaxation of the four atoms surrounding the va-
cancy raises the energy of the a1 level and eventually shifts
it into the band gap. This rise in the a1 level can only be
accommodated if the level is empty, i.e., in the 31 charge
state for VN in GaN.
The transition level e(31/1) between the 31 and 1
charge states occurs at 0.59 eV above the valence-band
maximum ~VBM!,24 somewhat higher than the value of 0.16
eV reported in Ref. 75 or 0.39 eV reported in Ref. 93, pre-
sumably due to the use of a larger supercell which allows
better relaxation of VN
31 . The low formation energy of the
31 charge state under p-type conditions indicates that nitro-
gen vacancies can be a serious source of compensation in
p-type GaN.
C. Gallium vacancies
The gallium vacancy (VGa) is the lowest energy defect in
n-type GaN, where it acts as a triple acceptor. This defect
plays a role in donor compensation as well as in the fre-
quently observed yellow luminescence.
The electronic band structure of VGa shows levels within
about 1 eV of the valence-band maximum. In the wurtzite
structure these p-like t2 states are split in a singlet and a
doublet state. An outward breathing relaxation occurs: in the
32 charge state the three equivalent nitrogen atoms move
outward by '11% of the bond length, while the N atom
along the c axis moves outward by '12%.82

Gallium vacancies (VGa
32) have relatively low formation
energies in highly doped n-type material (EF high in the
gap!; they could therefore act as compensating centers. Yi
and Wessels94 have found evidence of compensation by a
triply charged defect in Se-doped GaN.
The Ga vacancy has a deep level ~the 22/32 transition
level! about 1.1 eV above the valence band.82,84 Transitions
between the conduction band ~or shallow donors! and this
deep level would therefore result in emission around 2.3 eV
~see Sec. II.H.3!. The gallium vacancy has therefore been
proposed as the source of the ‘‘yellow luminescence.’’
1. Yellow luminescence
The yellow luminescence ~YL! in GaN is a broad lumi-
nescence band centered around 2.2 eV. The YL appears to be
a universal feature: It has been observed in bulk GaN crys-
tallites as well as in epitaxial layers grown by different tech-
niques. The intensity can vary over a wide range, with good
samples exhibiting almost no YL.
The origins of the YL have been widely debated. Ogino
and Aoki95 proposed a model in which the YL is a transition
between a shallow donor and a deep acceptor level, as illus-
trated in Fig. 7; a variety of experiments have conﬁrmed this
model. Proposals for the microscopic nature of the deep level
have included a complex between a Ga vacancy (VGa) and a
carbon atom;95 a NGa antisite;96 and an isolated VGa
82,97 ~or a
complex between VGa and oxygen82!.
At this point in time the gallium vacancy ~in isolated
form or complexed with an impurity! appears to be the most
likely source of the yellow luminescence; evidence is pre-
sented below.
2. Experimental conﬁrmation
a. Complexing with donor impurities Gallium vacancies
can form complexes with donor impurities in GaN.82 The
VGa–SiGa complex has a rather small binding energy, due to
its components being only second-nearest neighbors. The
VGa–ON complex, on the other hand, has a large binding
energy ~1.8 eV, see Refs. 82 and 84!, and can therefore en-
hance the concentration of Ga vacancies. The electronic
structure of this complex is very similar to that of the iso-
lated gallium vacancy, giving rise to a deep level again about
1.1 eV above the valence band. The presence of oxygen can
therefore enhance the concentration of Ga vacancies and
hence the YL.
An increase in VGa concentrations has indeed been ob-
served in positron anihilation experiments on oxygen-doped
samples ~Ref. 98, see next section!. The correlation with
oxygen is also a likely explanation for the increase in YL
intensity in the neighborhood of the interface with the sap-
phire substrate,99 where the oxygen concentration is known
to be higher.100,101
We also note that Reshchikov et al.102 have observed a
yellow luminescence band centered at 2.15 eV and a green
luminescence band centered at 2.43 eV in a 200 mm thick
GaN layer grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy ~HVPE!.
The microscopic origin of these transitions is still unclear,
but complexing of VGa with different types of impurities or
defects could be a potential explanation.
The formation of complexes involving Ga vacancies
causes a small shift in the transition energy, contributing to a
broadening of the luminescence line. Other factors contrib-
uting to the width of the line could be strain, proximity to
extended defects, and Coulomb effects in the recombination
of donor-acceptor pairs with varying separations.
b. Positron annihilation The most direct evidence of a
correlation between Ga vacancies and YL has emerged from
positron
annihilation
measurements
by
Saarinen
and
coworkers.103 These experiments provide a direct probe of
vacancies in the sample. It was found that the concentration
of VGa correlates with the intensity of the YL, providing
direct evidence for the involvement of the VGa acceptor lev-
els in the YL. Saarinen et al. also observed that the concen-
tration of gallium vacancies in MOCVD-grown GaN in-
creased from 1016 to 1019 cm23 when the V/III molar ratio
increased from 1000 to 10000,104 consistent with VGa being
more favorable in N-rich material. They also found that the
YL was suppressed in p-type material, consistent with easier
formation of VGa under n-type conditions.98 However, n-type
doping with oxygen resulted in higher concentrations of VGa
than doping with silicon, consistent with the formation of
VGa2ON complexes leading to an enhancement in VGa con-
centrations.
c. n-type versus p-type GaN Gallium vacancies are
more likely to form in n-type than in p-type GaN. This trend
is consistent with experimental observations indicating sup-
pression of the YL in p-type material.98,105–107 Conversely,
an increase in n-type doping increases the intensity of the
YL.108–110 Schubert et al.109 also found that the defects giv-
ing rise to the YL act as compensating centers, in agreement
with the gallium-vacancy model.
d. Ga-rich versus N-rich It is obvious that the concen-
tration of gallium vacancies will be lower in Ga-rich mate-
FIG. 7. Schematic illustration of the transition between a shallow donor and
a deep acceptor that leads to the yellow luminescence in GaN. Ogino and
Aoki95 placed the deep acceptor level at 860 meV above the valence-band
maximum. The calculated 22/32 transition level of the gallium vacancy is
located at 1.1 eV above the valence-band maximum.82 From Ref. 95.

rial. The YL was indeed found to be suppressed in samples
grown
by
metal-organic
chemical
vapor
deposition
~MOCVD! with higher gallium ﬂow rates.97,98,105 The YL
was also found to be stronger in samples grown under
N-stable conditions in molecular beam epitaxy ~MBE!, con-
sistent with higher VGa concentrations when the growth is
more N-rich.111
e. Recombination mechanism Various experiments have
linked the YL with a deep level located about 1 eV above the
valence band.96,112,113 This is in agreement with the calcu-
lated position of the defect level induced by the Ga
vacancy82 ~see Fig. 7!. In addition, the calculated pressure
dependence of this level is also consistent with experiment.96
f. Similarity with SA centers in II–VI compounds It is
useful to point out the similarity between the YL in GaN and
the so-called self-activated ~SA! luminescence in II–VI
compounds. Metal vacancies and their complexes with donor
impurities are well known in II–VI compounds ~e.g., ZnS,
ZnSe!. The metal vacancy complexes ~the so-called SA cen-
ters! exhibit features which are strikingly similar to the YL:
recombination between a shallow donorlike state and a deep
acceptor state, and a broad luminescence band of Gaussian
shape.114,115
D. Nitrogen interstitials
The ground state of nitrogen interstitials consists of a
split-interstitial conﬁguration in which the Ni forms a N–N
bond with one of the nitrogen host atoms, sharing its lattice
site.75 This conﬁguration is strongly energetically preferred
over other interstitial positions such as the octahedral (O) or
tetrahedral (T) interstitial sites, due to the large strength of
the N–N bond. The nitrogen interstitial can occur in various
charge states, as shown in Fig. 5. The N–N bond distance
varies from '1.1 Å in the 31 charge ~comparable to the
bond distance in N2) to '1.45 Å in the 12 charge state.24,75
In the neutral charge state Ni has two singlet states in the
band gap, occupied with three electrons. Depending on the
position of the Fermi level the nitrogen interstitial may act
both as an acceptor or a donor. However, nitrogen intersti-
tials have fairly high formation energies for all Fermi-level
positions ~Fig. 5!. They are thus unlikely to occur in thermal
equilibrium. However, their formation may be induced under
nonequilibrium
conditions,
for
instance
under
irra-
diation.116,117 They could also play a role in diffusion at high
temperatures.
E. Gallium interstitials
Obtaining accurate results for the atomic conﬁguration
of the gallium interstitial is difﬁcult due to the fairly large
lattice relaxations induced by this defect. In the wurtzite
structure, there are two distinct types of interstitial open
spaces, as shown in Fig. 8. T is the tetrahedral interstititial
site ~or cage site!. This site is equidistant from four Ga and
four N atoms. O is the octahedral interstitial site. This site is
in the ‘‘interstitial channel’’ along the c axis. The O site is
equidistant from six Ga and six N atoms. Both sites are ob-
vious candidates for local minima of an interstitial defect.
The calculations reported in Refs. 17 and 75 found the octa-
hedral site to be most stable for Gai , while it was argued in
Ref. 81 that the tetrahedral site was slightly more stable than
the O site. Based on our recent 96-atom supercells we can
now conﬁdently state that the octahedral interstitial site, at
the center of the hexagonal channel, is the stable site for Gai
in all charge states.24,75 The T site is not a local minimum,
but plays a role in the diffusion process.
As shown in Fig. 5, the stable charge states are 31 and
11, meaning that Gai always acts as a donor ~the lack of
stability of the 22 charge state gain being characteristic of a
‘‘negative-U’’ defect!. The formation energy of Gai
31 is low-
est ~but still higher than that of the nitrogen vacancy! for
Fermi-level positions near the valence-band maximum
~VBM!, i.e., under p-type conditions. The 12 state is not
thermodynamically stable, and the 11 charge state is stable
at higher Fermi levels, where the high formation energy ren-
ders its formation unlikely under equilibrium conditions.
However, Ga interstitials can be induced by non-equilibrium
processes, such as in the irradiation experiments of Ref. 118.
The gallium interstitial induces two defect levels, a deep
donor level and a resonance in the conduction band. In the
neutral charge state the deep donor level is doubly occupied
and the level in the conduction band singly occupied. Similar
as for the nitrogen vacancy this electron will be donated to
the bottom of the conduction band where it forms a shallow
donor level.
F. Nitrogen antisites
The nitrogen antisite (NGa) has a singlet and a doublet
state in the band gap. The atomic conﬁguration reﬂects a
strong distortion. As in the case of the nitrogen interstitial,
the driving force is the tendency to form strong N–N bonds:
the nitrogen atom on the Ga site moves toward a N neighbor
and forms a N–N bond. In Ref. 75 the N–N bond length was
found to be sensitive to the charge state: ﬁlling up the defect
levels increased the bond length from 1.2 Å in the 21 charge
state up to 1.5 Å in the 42 charge state. The distance to the
other three N neighbors was found to be much larger ~2.1 Å!
indicating that no bond is formed. The nitrogen antisite is

oms. The high-symmetry interstitial sites are indicated: O is the octahedral
interstitial site, T the tetrahedral interstitial site.

thus characterized only by a single N–N bond. Mattila
et al.83 also performed a detailed study of relaxations around
the nitrogen antisite in zinc-blende GaN. A metastability has
been found in the neutral charge state.62,83
The formation energy of the nitrogen antisite, in any of
its charge states, is quite high ~see Fig. 5!; it is thus unlikely
that NGa will form in appreciable concentrations.
G. Gallium antisites
The gallium antisite GaN has a singlet and a doublet state
in the band gap. The substitutional Ga atom forms four co-
valentlike bonds to the surrounding nearest neighbor Ga at-
oms, with a Ga–Ga bond length of '2.1 Å ~in the neutral
charge state!,75 much shorter than the bond length in bulk Ga
~2.44 Å!.119 In spite of this signiﬁcant compression the
Ga–Ga bond length is still '12% larger than the bulk Ga–N
bond length, indicative of a large strain. Indeed, atomic re-
laxation lowers the formation energy by nearly 5 eV. How-
ever, the formation energy remains too high for this defect to
ever occur in appreciable concentrations.
H. Complexes
We already mentioned an example of complex formation
between a native defect and an impurity, namely the VGa
2ON complex. It is also of interest to consider complexes
between two native defects. Mattila and Nieminen84 per-
formed calculations for complexes between nitrogen and gal-
lium vacancies. They found the dominant charge state of the
complex to be 22, as expected based on the dominant
charge states of the constituents: 32 for VGa and 1 for VN .
The binding energy is sizeable, but the formation energy of
the complex did not seem low enough, for any position of
the Fermi level, for the complex to ever occur in appreciable
concentrations. Put another way: since VN is unlikely to oc-
cur under n-type conditions, and VGa unlikely to occur under
p-type conditions, no conditions can be identiﬁed where both
would be favorable enough for a complex to form.
Chadi120 has proposed that a complex consisting of a
nitrogen antisite and a nitrogen vacancy may be important in
p-type GaN. Such a complex could originate starting from a
gallium vacancy by moving a neigboring nitrogen atom to
the vacancy site. Chadi focused on the signiﬁcant lowering
in energy that can be achieved by converting VGa
32 into a
@NGa2VN#31 complex: as much as 3.2 eV when the Fermi
level is at the valence-band maximum.120 However, our cal-
culations show that, under Ga-rich conditions and for EF
5Ev , the sum of formation energies of NGa
21 and VN
1 still
exceeds 5.3 eV. Even a sizeable binding energy and/or a shift
to N-rich conditions cannot bring the formation energy of
@NGa2VN#31 to low enough values for this complex to occur
in large enough concentrations to affect the electronic prop-
erties.
I. Comparison between GaN and GaAs
It is informative to compare the formation of native
point defects in GaN with the situation in a more conven-
tional semiconductor such as GaAs. Two main differences
are evident.
First, we noted that in GaN only vacancies have low
formation energies. In contrast, in GaAs self-interstitials, an-
tisites,
and
vacancies
all
have
comparable
formation
energies.23,91,121 The high formation energy of antisites and
interstitials in GaN can be explained in terms of the large
mismatch in the covalent radii of Ga and N. When a large
atom ~Ga! is brought into the crystal (Gai , GaN) the atoms
around the defect have to move away from the defect, lead-
ing to large strains. Although atomic relaxation signiﬁcantly
reduces the formation energy ~sometimes by several electron
volts!, the resulting formation energy remains high. Con-
versely, when a small atom ~N! is brought into the crystal
(Ni , NGa) the initial bond length is too long to form nearest-
neighbor bonds. The system seems to prefer to break the
symmetry and form low-symmetry conﬁgurations: for both
the N interstitial and the N antisite we ﬁnd that structures
with one short N–N bond are preferred. Again, however, the
large displacements necessary to allow formation of this
N–N bond lead to signiﬁcant strains and sizeable formation
energies.
Second, in GaN the defect with the overall lowest for-
mation energy is the nitrogen vacancy, under both Ga-rich
and N-rich conditions. If deviations from stoichiometry oc-
cur due to point-defect formation, they will therefore always
tend toward nitrogen-deﬁcient material ~even under N-rich
conditions!. This was conﬁrmed by explicit self-consistent
calculations of point-defect concentrations and stoichiom-
etries in Ref. 121. In contrast, in GaAs point-defect forma-
tion energies are more ‘‘balanced,’’ and As-rich conditions
would indeed lead to As-rich material. The reason for the
asymmetry in GaN can be found in the high binding energy
of nitrogen molecules, which makes it difﬁcult ~or even im-
possible! for the GaN solid to ever become nitrogen-rich:
Nitrogen atoms much prefer to leave the solid and become
part of N2 molecules, rather than incorporate in the solid in
the form of nitrogen-rich point defects. This feature is absent
in the case of GaAs, where As molecules exhibit only modest
binding energies.
J. Native defects in AlN
Studies of native defects in AlN are of interest for two
main reasons. First, AlN is being considered as a candidate
substrate for epitaxial growth of nitrides; indeed, bulk crys-
tals of AlN are somewhat easier to obtain than crystals of
GaN.122 Second, AlGaN alloys are widely used in device
structures, and knowledge of native defects is important for
improving the crystal quality. Studies that explicitly address
point defects in alloys are rare so far; indeed, the accurate
calculation of both alloy and defect properties requires large
supercells, and a large number of calculations to address all
relevant conﬁgurations. Bogusławski and Bernholc123 fo-
cused on identifying trends in the formation energy of nitro-
gen vacancies in AlGaN alloys, ﬁnding a strong dependence
on the chemical identities of the nearest neighbors. Lacking
detailed information about alloys, the properties of native
defects in AlGaN can, as a ﬁrst approximation, be obtained
by interpolating between AlN and GaN.

We will not discuss AlN in as much detail as we have
GaN, but conﬁne ourselves to mentioning the principal stud-
ies that have been performed along with their main conclu-
sions.
First-principles calculations of formation energies of na-
tive defects in AlN were performed by Mattila and
Nieminen,84 Gorczyca et al.,62 Fara et al.,124 and Stampﬂand
Van de Walle.44,125 The main conclusions are similar to those
for GaN: Self-interstitials and antisites are high in energy in
wurtzite AlN, and only vacancies have low enough formation
energies to occur in high enough concentrations to affect the
electronic properties. An interesting exception occurs in zinc-
blende AlN, where the Al interstitial ~a triple donor! was
found to have lower energy than the nitrogen vacancy in
p-type material.44 The lower formation energy of Ali in the
zinc-blende phase is probably due to the fact that in the
wurtzite phase the interstitial can only strongly interact with
three N neighbors, while in zinc blende it can form bonds
with four nitrogens. This explanation is similar to the one
proposed in the case of the beryllium interstitial in wurtzite
and zinc-blende GaN.64
The difference between zinc-blende and wurtzite struc-
tures also leads to interesting differences in the case of the
nitrogen vacancy, related to the position of the higher-lying
defect-induced level:44,124 In zinc blende, this level is a reso-
nance in the conduction band causing the vacancy to act as a
shallow donor, while in wurtzite ~which has a larger band
gap! the level lies well below the conduction-band edge
causing the vacancy to act as a deep donor.
K. Native defects in InN
Indium
nitride
is
the
least
studied
of
the
group
III-nitrides. Bulk InN is difﬁcult to prepare due to its low
thermal stability; reliable experimental information about the
properties of InN is therefore scarce. In fact, it was only
recently discovered52,53 that the band gap of InN is not 1.9
eV, as was long believed, but only ;0.8 eV. Not intention-
ally doped InN has often been found to have very high elec-
tron densities–an observation similar to GaN before better
doping control of that material was achieved. The uninten-
tional n-type conductivity of InN has been attributed to the
nitrogen vacancy as well as to the nitrogen antisite.126,127
Indium-containing nitride alloys are an important constituent
in optoelectronic devices: for example, the active layer in
short-wavelength light-emitting diodes and laser diodes usu-
ally consists of InxGa12xN. Increasing the In content of the
alloy, in principle, makes it possible to extend the emitting
light range from UV to red. Knowledge of point defects in
InN is once again the ﬁrst step toward developing an under-
standing of defects in InGaN alloys.
Few calculations have been performed for native defects
in InN. An important problem in InN is the value of the band
gap, which is close to zero in DFT-LDA calculations. It
should be emphasized that the closure of the gap occurs only
near the G point, affecting only a very small portion of the
Brillouin zone; at the special k-points used for reciprocal-
space integrations the material still behaves like a semicon-
ductor. Still, a critical examination of the DFT-LDA results is
appropriate. Stampﬂand Van de Walle51 addressed this prob-
lem by using the self-interaction and relaxation-corrected
~SIRC! pseudopotentials.50 As discussed in Sec. II B 3, the
study showed that the conclusions obtained with LDA are
not affected by the computational approach.
The results for point defects are again qualitatively simi-
lar to those for GaN: Self-interstitials and antisites are high
in energy, and vacancies are mainly important as compensat-
ing centers. The nitrogen vacancy, a shallow donor, is the
lowest energy native defect in InN. In n-type material its
formation energy is high ~much higher than that of common
impurities such as oxygen, silicon, or hydrogen, which all act
as donors!. Nitrogen vacancies thus do not account for the
observed n-type conductivity of as-grown InN.
IV. IMPURITIES
A. Donors in GaN
Calculations for extrinsic donors have been performed
for silicon, germanium, and oxygen.84,93,128,129 While carbon
could in principle behave as a donor when incorporated on
the gallium site, the formation energy for this conﬁguration
is very high, and much larger than for incorporation of car-
bon on the nitrogen site, where it acts as an acceptor. Silicon
is the most widely used intentional n-type dopant, while oxy-
gen is the most likely candidate for unintentional doping.
Figure 9 summarizes ﬁrst-principles results for native
defects and impurities relevant for n-type doping ~see Sec.
II I for a discussion of error bars!. The ﬁgure incorporates
information from Refs. 82 and 24. We observe that nitrogen
vacancies (VN) have high energies in n-type GaN, and are
thus unlikely to occur in signiﬁcant concentrations. This

gallium vacancies! and donors ~oxygen and silicon! in GaN. The zero of
Fermi energy is located at the top of the valence band. Gallium-rich condi-
tions and equilibrium with Ga2O3 and Si3N4 are assumed.

ﬁnding allowed us to conclude that nitrogen vacancies are
not responsible for n-type conductivity in GaN. In contrast,
Fig. 9 shows that oxygen and silicon have relatively low
formation energies in n-type GaN, and can thus be readily
incorporated. Both oxygen and silicon form shallow donors
in GaN. The slope of the lines in Fig. 9 indicates the charge
state of the defect or impurity: SiGa, ON , and VN all appear
with slope 11, indicating they are single donors.
1. Oxygen
The suggestion that oxygen can be responsible for
n-type conductivity in GaN was made by Seifert et al.89 and
by Chung and Gershenzon.90 Still, the prevailing conven-
tional wisdom, attributing the n-type behavior to nitrogen
vacancies, proved hard to overcome. After ﬁrst-principles
calculations showed that nitrogen vacancies could not ex-
plain the observed n-type conductivity,17 more detailed ex-
periments were performed, which conﬁrmed that uninten-
tionally doped n-type GaN samples contained concentrations
of extrinsic donors ~particularly oxygen! high enough to ex-
plain the electron concentrations.
Go
¨tz et al.130 reported electrical characterization of in-
tentionally
Si-doped
as
well
as
unintentionally
doped
samples grown by MOCVD, and concluded that the n-type
conductivity in the latter was due to silicon. They also found
evidence of another shallow donor with a slightly higher
activation energy, which was attributed to oxygen. Go
¨tz
et al. also carried out SIMS ~secondary-ion mass spectros-
copy! and electrical measurements on hydride vapor phase
epitaxy ~HVPE! material, ﬁnding levels of oxygen or silicon
in agreement with the electron concentration.100
High levels of n-type conductivity have always been
found in GaN bulk crystals grown at high temperature and
high pressure.131 It has been established that the characteris-
tics of these samples ~obtained from high-pressure studies!
are very similar to epitaxial ﬁlms which are intentionally
doped with oxygen.132,133 The n-type conductivity of bulk
GaN can therefore be attributed to unintentional oxygen in-
corporation.
The high-pressure experiments have also shown that
freezeout of carriers occurs at pressures exceeding 20
GPa.131,133–135 Originally this observation was interpreted as
consistent with the presence of nitrogen vacancies, since the
VN donor gives rise to a resonance in the conduction band,
which emerges into the band gap under pressure. However,
the
observations
are
also
entirely
consistent
with
a
‘‘DX-like’’ behavior of the oxygen donor.
The prototype DX center is silicon in GaAs, which un-
dergoes a transition from a shallow to a deep center when
hydrostatic pressure is applied.12 First-principles calculations
for oxygen in GaN under pressure14 show that at sufﬁciently
high pressure the oxygen impurity moves off the substitu-
tional site and assumes an off-center conﬁguration ~see Fig.
10!: a large outward relaxation introduces a deep level in the
band gap, and the center actually becomes negatively
charged ~i.e., it behaves as an acceptor!. Alloying with AlN
increases the band gap similar to the application of hydro-
static pressure; the behavior of impurities in AlGaN should
therefore be similar to that in GaN under pressure. Indeed,
ﬁrst-principles calculations14,93 show that oxygen will un-
dergo a DX transition in AlxGa12xN when x.0.3, consistent
with the observed decrease in n-type conductivity of unin-
tentionally doped AlGaN.15,136,137 A conﬁguration coordinate
diagram for oxygen in AlN is shown in Fig. 3. The conclu-
sion is that oxygen cannot be used as a shallow donor in
AlxGa12xN when x.0.3. Even if another donor impurity is
used that does not exhibit DX behavior, the presence of oxy-
gen in the layer could be detrimental to n-type conductivity:
Indeed, once oxygen undergoes the DX transition it behaves
as a deep acceptor, and therefore counteracts the electrical
activity of other donors.
2. Silicon
SiGa is an energetically very stable conﬁguration; the ni-
trogen substitutional site and the interstitial conﬁgurations
are energetically unfavorable.75 This can be understood by
noting that silicon has an atomic radius very similar to gal-
lium. Thus, while easily ﬁtting in on a Ga site, it causes a
large strain if it replaces a small N atom or goes on an inter-
stitial site.
Several ﬁrst-principles studies have addressed the issue
whether silicon donors undergo a DX transition. Park and
Chadi93 reported that Si becomes a DX center in AlxGa12xN
at x.0.24. Possible geometries for the Si DX center are
shown in Fig. 11; Park and Chadi found the a-BB conﬁgu-
ration to be most favorable in AlN. Bogusławski and
Bernholc129 found that Si in AlxGa12xN would undergo a
shallow-deep transition at x.0.6. Van de Walle, ﬁnally, re-
ported that Si would remain shallow throughout the alloy
range.14
Experimentally it has been conﬁrmed that Si remains a
shallow donor in GaN under pressure up to 25 GPa135 and in
AlxGa12xN alloys up to x50.44.15 For higher Al content,
several groups have reported that Si seems to undergo a
shallow-deep transition.138–140 However, even in the deep
state the activation energy is still modest. A conﬁguration
coordinate diagram based on the experimental work of Zeisel
et al.139 is shown in Fig. 12. Further work will be necessary
in order to establish whether silicon is a viable dopant in
AlGaN with high Al content.

impurity in wurtzite AlN. The dotted lines indicate the oxygen position in

3. Germanium
Park and Chadi93 found that Ge is a shallow donor in
both GaN and AlN, i.e., it does not exhibit a DX transition.
In contrast, Bogusławski and Bernholc129 found that Ge in
AlxGa12xN would undergo a DX transition at x.0.3. Ex-
perimentally, Zhang et al.141 found Ge in AlxGa12xN to be a
shallow donor for x,0.2; the behavior of Ge in AlGaN al-
loys with x.0.2 remains an open question.
B. Acceptors in GaN
1. Magnesium
Magnesium has emerged as the acceptor dopant of
choice in GaN. It has been found, however, that hole con-
centrations obtained with Mg doping are limited.142,143 In
addition, it is well known that Mg-doped GaN grown by
MOCVD needs to be subjected to post-growth treatments
such as low-energy electron-beam irradiation7 or thermal
annealing8 in order to activate the acceptors. All of these
features have been addressed by ﬁrst-principles calculations.
Figure 13 shows calculated formation energies for impu-
rities and defects relevant for p-type GaN, for Ga-rich con-
ditions ~see Sec. II I for a discussion of error bars!. The ﬁg-
ure incorporates information from Refs. 10, 24, and 144. The
Mg acceptor has a low enough formation energy to be incor-
porated in large concentrations in GaN. For the purposes of
the plot, we have assumed Ga-rich conditions ~which are
actually the least favorable for incorporating Mg on Ga
sites!, and equilibrium with Mg3N2 , which determines the
solubility limit for Mg. We note that the formation energies
for MgGa
0
and MgGa
2 intersect for a Fermi level position
around 200 meV; this transition level would correspond to
the ionization energy of the Mg acceptor. Since the calcu-
lated formation energies are subject to numerical error bars
of 60.1 eV, this value should not be taken as an accurate
assessment of the ionization energy. Nonetheless, it is in rea-
sonable agreement with the experimental value of 208 meV

determined by Go
¨tz et al.145 Other calculated values for the
ionization energy of Mg in GaN are included in Table I.
Other positions of Mg in the lattice have been investi-
gated. ‘‘Antisite’’ (MgN) conﬁgurations and Mg on intersti-
tial
sites
(Mgi)
were
found
to
have
high
formation
energies.10 In addition, AX center conﬁgurations, in which
the Mg moves off the substitutional site similar to the donor
DX centers discussed in Sec. IV A, were also found to be
unfavorable.93 We therefore conclude that Mg overwhelm-
ingly prefers the Ga site in GaN, the main competition being
with the formation of Mg3N2 , which is the solubility-
limiting phase. Note that in this discussion we focused on
doping limitations related to point defects. It has also been
proposed162,163 that the formation of extended defects, in par-
ticular pyramidal inversion domains, causes the compensa-
tion of highly Mg-doped material.
Other potential sources of compensation are also illus-
trated in Fig. 13. The nitrogen vacancy, which had a high
formation energy in n-type GaN ~see Fig. 9! has a signiﬁ-
cantly lower formation energy in p-type material, and could
potentially act as a compensating center. However, we also
note that hydrogen, when present, has a formation energy
much lower than that of the nitrogen vacancy. In growth
situations where hydrogen is present ~such as MOCVD or
HVPE! Mg-doped material will preferentially be compen-
sated by hydrogen, and compensation by nitrogen vacancies
will be suppressed.164 The role of hydrogen in p-type doping
is discussed below, in Sec. IV C 2.
Figures 5 and 13 show that VN exhibits a 31/1 transi-
tion around 0.6 eV ~see Sec. III B!, associated with a large
lattice relaxation in the 31 charge state. Compensation by
VN may therefore be responsible for the persistent photocon-
ductivity effects that have been observed in Mg-doped
material.165–167 The nitrogen vacancy also may give rise to
the blue lines ~around 2.9 eV! commonly observed by pho-
toluminescence in Mg-doped GaN.93,167
However, the microscopic origin of the blue lumines-
cence and the source of compensation are still controversial.
Lee and Chang168 proposed a variant of the vacancy model,
involving a complex of a Mg interstitial and a nitrogen va-
cancy, and Reboredo and Pantelides169 proposed various
substitutional-interstitial complexes that can bind hydrogen.
2. Alternative acceptors
For Mg, we concluded that achievable doping levels are
mainly limited by the solubility of Mg in GaN. Several
groups have investigated other candidate acceptors in GaN,
and evaluated them in terms of solubility, shallow versus
deep character, and potential compensation due to incorpo-
ration on other sites.11,64,150,155,156,158,170,171 The impurities
studied include Li, Na, K, Be, Zn, Ca, Cd, and C. The study
of Ref. 11 showed that the incorporation of an acceptor on
the substitutional site is governed by the atomic radius,
which determines the energy cost of relaxation, and by the
bond strength, which can be estimated using the enthalpy of
formation of speciﬁc compounds. For instance, when Mg is
placed on a Ga site, it is surrounded by four N atoms, much
like it would be in Mg3N2 , which has an enthalpy of forma-
tion of 24.80 eV ~Ref. 172!. For Be, the comparable number
would be the enthalpy of formation of Be3N2 , which is
26.11 eV. This would indicate that BeGa is more strongly
bound and should have a lower formation energy than MgGa;
however, this is countered by the fact that the atomic size of
Be is much smaller than that of Mg ~which is more closely
matched to Ga!, leading to a large energy cost due to strain.
The ﬁnal result is that the formation energy of Be is only
slightly lower than that of Ga.11
Calculated ionization energies are listed in Table I, and
calculated formation energies of neutral acceptors are sum-
marized in Table II. The various studies have shown that
none of the investigated impurities performs better than Mg
in all respects. Only Be has a comparable solubility, and it
may have a lower ionization energy. However, Be may suffer
from compensation due to incorporation on interstitial sites.
Only Be has emerged as a viable acceptor, exhibiting
higher solubility and lower ionization energy than Mg. The
possibility that silicon could incorporate on the nitrogen site
and act as a shallow acceptor has sometimes been consid-
ered; however, the formation energy of SiN is so high129,150
~due to the size mismatch discussed in Sec. IV A 2! that its
formation is highly unlikely.
The ionization energy for Be reported in Fig. 13 is 170
meV.64 This value is slightly lower than the value previously
calculated value for Mg.164 We emphasize that the error bar
on these values ~which we estimate to be at least 100 meV!
does not allow drawing ﬁrm conclusions about the magni-
tude of the ionization energy. Still, the similarity of the val-
ues for Be and Mg is in line with the expectation that the
ionization energy for these shallow acceptors is largely de-
termined by intrinsic properties of the semiconductor, such
as effective masses and dielectric constants. Indeed, predic-
tions from effective mass theory147,151 for ionization energies
of substitutional acceptors in wurtzite GaN produce values
for Be between 185 and 233 meV–only slightly lower than
the calculated value for Mg. Bernardini et al.171 reported a
TABLE I. Ionization energies of acceptors in GaN, EA , in eV, as calculated
by ﬁrst-principles DFT-LDA, and by effective-mass theory ~EMT!. Experi-
mental values are listed where available. Values are for wurtzite GaN, ex-

much smaller value ~60 meV! for the Be ionization energy.
The most likely explanation for this discrepancy is that Ber-
nardini et al. did not include the correction term Ecorr, dis-
cussed in Sec. II D 3. This correction lowers the formation
energy of the neutral charge state, and hence increases the
ionization energy. Neglect of the correction would thus result
in artiﬁcially low acceptor ionization energies.
While the properties of substitutional BeGa render it at-
tractive as a shallow acceptor, the calculations have also
shown that incorporation of Be on interstitial sites, where it
acts as a donor, may lead to self-compensation.11,64 In order
to assess the extent of this problem, and avenues for over-
coming it, the diffusivity of interstitial Be was investigated in
detail in Ref. 64, using the technique of total energy surfaces
outlined in Sec. II G. A large anisotropy in the diffusion was
found, with a migration barrier in planes perpendicular to the
c axis of 1.2 eV, while the barrier for motion along the c-axis
is 2.9 eV. Complexes between interstitial Be and substitu-
tional Be (Beint–BeGa) were also investigated and found to
have a binding energy of 1.35 eV.64 Northrup29 has suggested
that the problem of compensation by Be interstitials may be
overcome by controlling Be incorporation at the surface, in
particular in the presence of indium.
Although Be doping of GaN has been reported by vari-
ous groups, no conclusive results regarding its doping efﬁ-
ciency have been obtained. The experimental situation was
discussed in Ref. 64.
Lithium
has
also
been
studied
as
a
potential
acceptor,11,146 but the calculated ionization energy is not as
low as that of Be, and Li also suffers from compensation by
self-interstitials. The migration barriers were investigated in
Ref. 146: the results were 1.42 eV for motion in planes per-
pendicular to the c axis, and 1.55 eV for motion along the
c-axis. The anisotropy is thus much smaller than in the case
of Be.
3. Compensation
It may seem obvious that, when acceptor doping is per-
formed, the incorporation of unintentional donor-type impu-
rities should be carefully controlled, since they may cause
compensation. As mentioned in Sec. I C 5, such control can
be a bit tricky. Consider, for instance a donor species which
is known to be present as a contaminant in the growth envi-
ronment, either introduced through the host-atom sources or
emanating from the walls of a chamber. To a good approxi-
mation, the chemical potential of this species will therefore
be roughly constant, for the speciﬁc temperature and pres-
sure corresponding to the growth conditions. Equation ~2!
shows that the formation energy of the donor species then
depends only on the Fermi level. As can be seen in Fig. 9,
the formation energy decreases when the Fermi level moves
towards the valence band. The donor species will therefore
have a much higher tendency to incorporate in p-type mate-
rial than in n-type.
It would therefore be dangerous to base an assessment of
contaminants ~for instance through SIMS studies! solely on
data for n-type material. An unintentional donor that shows
up in fairly low concentrations in n-type material may indeed
have a much lower formation energy, and hence a higher
concentration, in p-type material.
C. Hydrogen
Hydrogen has strong effects on the properties of GaN.
Many growth techniques, such as metal-organic chemical va-
por deposition ~MOCVD! or hydride vapor phase epitaxy
~HVPE! expose the growing material to large concentrations
of hydrogen. The presence of hydrogen has particularly im-
portant consequences for p-type doping of the material: Hy-
drogen incorporated during growth leads to passivation of
acceptors, and a post-growth processing step is required to
render the acceptors electrically active.
A detailed overview of theoretical work on the role of
hydrogen in GaN has been given in a recent review paper.173
We therefore refrain from providing a comprehensive discus-
sion here. Instead, we merely brieﬂy review the most impor-
tant aspects of hydrogen’s behavior, and cite some more re-
cent work that was not included in Ref. 173.
1. Isolated interstitial hydrogen
Isolated interstitial hydrogen behaves as an amphoteric
impurity in GaN.76,144,164,174–176 Figure 14 illustrates the
atomic conﬁgurations,176 while Fig. 15 shows the calculated
formation energy of hydrogen in various charge states as a
function of Fermi level. The formation energy is deﬁned as
the energy difference between hydrogen at an interstitial po-
sition in GaN, and hydrogen in a reservoir ~in this case free
H2 molecules at T50 K).76 The values in Fig. 15 are ob-
tained from 96-atom supercell calculations for wurtzite GaN
using the nlcc,80 but the values are quite close to the 32-atom
zinc-blende supercell results of Ref. 76. Error bars are dis-
cussed in Sec. II I. One immediate conclusion from Fig. 15 is
that the formation energy of hydrogen is lower in p-type
GaN than in n-type GaN, corresponding to a much higher
solubility in p-type than in n-type GaN.

Myers et al.176,177 used ﬁrst-principles formation ener-
gies for H in various conﬁgurations to predict solubilities in
p-type, intrinsic, and n-type material, and compared the re-
sults with experimental observations. They found good
agreement, provided the hydrogen formation energies were
adjusted by 0.22 eV.
In p-type GaN, H behaves as a donor (H1); it thus
compensates acceptors. The preferred locations for H1 are at
the antibonding site behind a nitrogen atom, or at the bond-
center site; in either case H is strongly bonded to the nitrogen
atom. The diffusion barrier for H1 is only 0.7 eV, which
indicates a high diffusivity at moderate to high temperatures.
In n-type GaN, H behaves as an acceptor (H2); its most
stable site is at the antibonding site behind a Ga atom. The
migration barrier for H2 is high, corresponding to a very low
diffusivity. For Fermi-level positions below '2.1 eV H1 is
favored; higher Fermi-level positions favor H2. The neutral
charge state is never stable, characteristic of a so-called
negative-U center.
2. Acceptor-hydrogen complexes
The behavior of isolated interstitial hydrogen, as dis-
cussed in Sec. IV C 1 above, provides crucial information
about interaction with impurities. Since both the solubility
and the diffusivity of hydrogen in n-type GaN are low,
hydrogen-donor complexes will rarely form, and we focus on
complexes with acceptors.
In p-type GaN hydrogen occurs in the positive charge
state and is electrostatically attracted to negatively charged
acceptors. In the case of Mg acceptors, H sits in an antibond-
ing position behind a N atom which is a neighbor of the
acceptor, with a binding energy of 0.7 eV.76,164,176 In the case
of Be acceptors, the H atom favors a bond-center site in the
Be-H complex, with a binding energy of 1.8 eV.64,171
The hydrogen atom is strongly bonded to a nitrogen
atom in these acceptor-hydrogen complexes; as a conse-
quence the vibrational frequency of the complex is represen-
tative of a N–H bond. The calculated vibrational frequency
is 3360 cm21 ~Ref. 76! or 3284 cm21 ~Ref. 176! in the har-
monic approximation, or 3045 cm21 if anharmonic effects
are taken into account.80 These values agree well with the
experimental number of 3125 cm21, measured by Fourier-
transform infrared absorption spectroscopy.178–180 Alterna-
tive structures of the Mg–H complex have been investigated
by Fall et al.181 and Limpijumnong et al.79
Figure 15 compares the formation energy of hydrogen in
p-GaN with that of the nitrogen vacancy. In the absence of
hydrogen, nitrogen vacancies are the dominant compensating
centers, and due to charge neutrality the Fermi level will be
located near the point where the formation energies of VN
1
and MgGa
2 are equal. When hydrogen is present, however,
compensation by nitrogen vacancies is suppressed. The Mg
concentration is also increased, compared to the hydrogen-
free case. This can be understood by inspection of the for-
mation energies in Fig. 15: since the formation energy of
hydrogen is lower than that of VN
1 , the Fermi level equili-
bration point is moved higher in the gap, leading to a lower
formation energy and hence higher concentration of Mg. In-
corporation of hydrogen is therefore beneﬁcial in two re-
spects: suppression of native defects, and enhancement of the
acceptor concentration. Incorporation of hydrogen of course
has the downside that complete compensation of the accep-
tors occurs, hence the need for a post-growth anneal to acti-
vate Mg-doped MOCVD-grown GaN.8,182 The activation can
also be achieved by low-energy electron beam irradiation;7
this process has recently been investigated in more detail,
experimentally as well as theoretically.183
Since H acts as a donor in p-type GaN, the improvement
in p-type doping is actually an example of successful codop-
ing; we return to this issue in Sec. IV D.
3. Interactions of hydrogen with native defects
Interactions of hydrogen with native point defects in
GaN have been studied in Refs. 167, 184 and 185. Since

relaxations to be discerned. H1 resides at the bond center, while H0 and H2
are located at the center of the hexagonal channel. The H2 molecule also

antisites and self-interstitials are unlikely to form in GaN
~see Sec. III! we focus on H interacting with vacancies. This
interaction is often described in terms of tying off dangling
bonds. This picture does not apply in the case of the nitrogen
vacancy, which is surrounded by Ga atoms at a distance of
1.95 Å from the center of the vacancy; a typical Ga–H bond
distance is too large for more than one H to ﬁt inside the
vacancy. The calculated binding energy of the (VNH)21
complex, expressed with respect to interstitial H in the posi-
tive charge state, is 1.56 eV.167
In the case of the gallium vacancy (VGa) one, two, three,
or four H atoms can be accommodated in the vacancy, and
levels are removed from the band gap as more hydrogens are
attached.167,184 Distinct N–H bonds are formed, with stretch
frequencies between 3100 and 3200 cm21. Hydrogenated
gallium vacancies with one or two H atoms behave in much
the same way as the unhydrogenated kind; they may there-
fore contribute to compensation of donors as well as to the
yellow luminescence ~see Sec. III C!.
4. Hydrogen in AlN and InN
The behavior of hydrogen in AlN is very similar to
GaN:144 H1 dominates in p-type, H2 in n-type. Due to the
larger band gap of AlN, the solubility of H could be signiﬁ-
cantly larger than in GaN under both p-type and n-type con-
ditions. Calculations for H in InN, however, revealed a true
surprise:144 hydrogen in InN behaves exclusively as a donor.
I.e., it is not amphoteric as in GaN and AlN, but actually
contributes to the n-type conductivity of the material. This
donor behavior is due to the fact that H0 and H2 are always
higher in energy than H1, making H1 the only stable charge
state for all positions of the Fermi level. This theoretical
prediction has been conﬁrmed by experimental studies on
MBE-grown samples186 as well as by investigations of muo-
nium, a pseudoisotope of hydrogen.187
D. Codoping
The concept of ‘‘codoping’’ involves the incorporation
of donors along with acceptors when p-type doping is at-
tempted. Codoping has been proposed as an effective way of
increasing hole concentrations in p-type GaN. Experimen-
tally, codoping with oxygen has been reported to result in
high
hole
conductivities
in
the
case
of
beryllium-
oxygen188,189 or magnesium-oxygen190,191 codoping. Yama-
moto and Katayama-Yoshida192 have proposed that com-
plexes consisting of two acceptors and one donor ~e.g., Mg–
O–Mg!
would
be
effective
in
enhancing
the
doping
efﬁciency, and would provide an explanation for the experi-
mental observations. Yamamoto and Katayama-Yoshida192
performed ﬁrst-principles calculations, but their arguments
were based mainly on trends in the electrostatic ~Madelung!
energy. Several ﬁrst-principles studies have now been per-
formed that investigate these proposed complexes in more
detail.
Be–O–Be complexes in GaN were investigated in Ref.
64. The formation energy of these complexes is not lower
than that of the isolated acceptors ~at least if equilibrium
with the proper solubility-limiting phases is taken into ac-
count!. Formation of acceptor-oxygen complexes ~which are
electrically neutral! is energetically quite favorable, but at-
taching a second acceptor impurity to such a complex is only
marginally favored. Finally, the ionization energy of Be–
O–Be was not lower than that of isolated acceptors ~within
the error bars of the calculations!. We also note that similar
acceptor-donor-acceptor complexes were investigated by
Zhang et al. in CdTe,193 and also found neither to increase
the solubility of the acceptor nor improve the shallowness of
the acceptor level. We therefore doubt that formation of Be–
O–Be or Mg–O–Mg complexes is a viable approach to in-
creasing p-type doping of GaN, or provides an explanation
for the experimentally observed p-type conductivity188–191 in
codoped samples. We cannot exclude the possibility, of
course, that the presence of the donor in the growth environ-
ment somehow improves the properties of the p-type layer in
some other fashion, for instance by acting as a surfactant.
The main problem with codoping is that the donors that
are incorporated alongside acceptors during the growth can-
not be removed from the acceptor-doped layer after the
growth. For the layer to be p-type, an excess of acceptors
still needs to be present, hence the idea of having two accep-
tors for every donor. However, the proposed acceptor–
donor–acceptor complexes do not seem to perform as prom-
ised. Going back to the notion of incorporating donors along
with acceptors, such compensation during the growth is in
fact quite desirable. Indeed, it shifts the Fermi level away
from the valence-band edge toward the middle of the gap.
This results in a lowering of the formation energy of accep-
tors ~and hence in an increase of the acceptor solubility!, as
well as an increase in the formation energy of compensating
donor-type native defects. However, the compensation by the
intentionally introduced donor will persist after growth, and
the material will not exhibit p-type conductivity.
This problem could be overcome if the donor could be
removed from the p-type layer after growth. This is obvi-
ously not possible with oxygen. It requires that the donor
impurity is not too strongly bound and exhibits a sufﬁciently
high diffusivity, so that the donors can be removed from the
vicinity of the acceptors during an anneal at modest tempera-
tures ~to avoid formation of other compensating defects!.
These criteria are fulﬁlled in the case of hydrogen, as de-
scribed in Sec. IV C 2. The concept of codoping thus works
successfully with hydrogen as the codopant.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In the ﬁrst part of this article, we reviewed the state of
the art in computational approaches for calculating defects
and impurities in semiconductors from ﬁrst principles. The
methodology is entirely general and can be applied to any
material. In the second part of the article, we focused on
applications
for
nitride
semiconductors.
First-principles
theory has played an important role in interpreting and guid-
ing experiments in this rapidly developing ﬁeld; in fact, in a
number of areas theory has led experiment, for instance in
the prediction of the behavior of hydrogen and its interac-
tions with acceptor impurities.

Looking toward the future, we can be conﬁdent that
ﬁrst-principles computations will continue to play an impor-
tant role in addressing defects and impurities, not only in the
nitrides but also in other semiconductors, including materials
such as ZnO ~Ref. 194! or transparent p-type conductors
such as SrCu2O2 .195 New developments in methodology
could make the approach even more powerful. As mentioned
in Sec. II B 3, the band-gap problem inherent in density-
functional calculations limits the accuracy in some cases, and
solving this problem should be an important goal. Other de-
velopments may render the exploration of migration paths or
of potential conﬁgurations for low-symmetry conﬁgurations
less cumbersome. The latter capability would make it easier
to study complexes between point defects and impurities, an
area that has been only superﬁcially explored so far.
We will also see increased attention being paid to inter-
actions between point defects or impurities and extended de-
fects. Finally, as mentioned in Sec. II A 3, interactions be-
tween point defects or impurities need to be explored in
greater detail. Just like point defects in the bulk play an
important role in diffusion, point defects at surfaces are
likely to affect atomic mobilities at surfaces, and hence play
a decisive role in growth. Likewise, a full understanding of
impurity incorporation requires comprehensive calculations
of the behavior of impurities at and near the surface. Such
ﬁrst-principles calculations can then form the foundation for
realistic simulations of the actual growth process.
