Abstract. AC (lo2-3 X lo5 
Hz) measurements have been performed on Sawyer premium- 
quality synthetic quartz oriented along the z axis, in the temperature range between 240 
and 1500 K. The samples were both ‘as-received’ and x-rayed, in the case of the lower- 
temperature measurements. 
The results confirm that the conductivity, in the temperature range considered, is essen- 
tially due to extrinsic phenomena, i.e. to the dissociation of AI-Na substitutional centres 
and to the migration process of alkali ions. 
An interpretative scheme is proposed, which involves the detailed structure of the 
attractive potential of a Na’ ion in the vicinity of an aluminium impurity and the increase in 
the radius of the z-axis channels in the P-quartz-to-tridymite transition. 
1. Introduction 
Years ago Hughes [l] 
demonstrated that a ‘low’-temperature (300 K) anisotropic ‘slow’ 
conductivity of ionic character takes place in irradiated quartz. Alkali ions liberated by 
x-irradiation from aluminium impurity centres were held responsible for such a charge 
transport process, and the activation energy of these ions turned out to be 0.27 eV. Such 
radiation-induced conductivity (RIC) was later studied by Jain and Nowick [2]. It was 
found that the phenomenon that annealed out at room temperature in few hours could 
be ‘frozen in’ at temperatures below 0 “C; 
in such conditions, Li and Na-electrodiffused 
quartz, studied by Green et d [ 3 ]  
yielded a migration energy 0.26 eV < 
E, < 
0.34 
eV 
with barely detectable 
differences between Na and Li. Also the 
RIC annealing mechanism 
was studied 
and has been related to the phosphorescence that occurs in irradiated quartz 
The ionic AC and DC conductivity at T > 
500 K was studied by several workers whose 
results are commented upon in a recent paper of ours [5] (see references therein). 
In summary, DC studies at 400 K < 
T < 
800 K, mostly performed on natural quartz 
oriented along the z axis, showed that the transport process had an activation energy 
ranging between 0.77 
and 1.61 
eV; however, these results are subject to criticism owing 
to the presence of polarisation effects and of electrodiffusion phenomena (‘sweeping’), 
AC conductance studies were carried out on both natural and synthetic oriented 
samples at 400 K < T < 
800 K; the activation energy E of the process, which equals 
~41.

1.3 eV, has been interpreted as a linear combination of the association energy E, of the 
Al-Mpair and of the migration energy E, of the alkali ion. Our 
AC results [5] 
on 
synthetic 
oriented quartz confirmed up to 800K the data in the literature and extended the 
explored temperature range up to 1200 K; a new lower activation energy E of 0.67 eV 
was found between 800 and 1200 K. 
The difference between the ‘low-temperature’ slope, 1.3 
eV, and the ‘high-tem- 
perature’ slope, 0.67 eV, was interpreted by considering that at low T the conductance 
mechanism is governed by additional unassociated aluminium ions, and the activation 
energy is E = E, + E,; at high T, 
on the contrary, the number of dissociated aluminium 
ions equals the number of free alkali ions, giving E = 4Ea + E,. This picture leads, 
however, to a value of the migration energy E, of 0.02 eV, which appeared exceedingly 
low. 
In this paper we report new results in a temperature range extended up to 1500 K; 
further, results on the AC conductance of irradiated samples in the range 
240 K < T < 
280 K are shown. The data here reported, and specifically a new high- 
temperature conduction regime featuring an activation energy of 0.27 eV, suggest a 
reinterpretation of the ionic transport mechanisms in quartz that considers the local 
structure of the potential of the interstitial alkali atoms trapped in the neighbourhood 
of an aluminium impurity [6,7]. 
2. Experimental conditions 
The electrical measurements were performed using a Wayne-Kerr 6425 AC bridge in the 
frequency range between lo2 
and 3 X lo5 
Hz and the data were analysed by means of 
the complex impedance method [SI. For the high-temperature 
studies the quartz samples 
were cylinders (diameter of 1 
cm; 0.5 cm thick) cut from Sawyer PQ bars; the same 
experimental apparatus already described elsewhere [5] was used. For the low-T 
measurements, the crystals were cut to the same diameter but were 0.05 cm thick; the 
samples were mounted in a capacitor clamped at the cold tail of a metal cryostat equipped 
with a beryllium window which allowed us to perform the irradiations in 
situ; 
these were 
carried out both at room temperature and at 230 K by an x-ray tube Machlett OEG 50 
operating at 38 kV and the total dose was up to lo4 
Gy. 
The surfaces of the samples were both ‘as cut’ and covered with a nickel deposition. 
In the two cases the complex impedance diagrams were quite different: at low and 
intermediate temperatures (up to 1200 K) the samples with nickel-deposited surfaces 
showed a semicircle due to the bulk contribution that was better defined than that 
obtained with as-cut samples; at high temperatures ( T  
> 1200 K), however, the metal 
deposition was not stable, giving large surface contibutions in the diagrams. 
In figures 1-3 are reported the complex impedance diagrams for different tem- 
perature ranges in the case of a sample with ‘as-cut’ 
surfaces. 
In figure l(a) the first semicircle relative to bulk properties is well defined and 
the value of the resistance of the sample can be easily calculated. By increasing the 
temperature (figure l(b)) the arc due to the bulk tends to disappear from our range of 
frequencies but the cusp between the semicircle of the bulk and that due to the contact 
with electrodes is still evident, allowing us to evaluate the bulk resistance. 
This situation remains at still higher temperatures where the arc due to electrode 
effects covers the entire frequency range (figure 2), decreasing its radius with increasing

as shown in the inset of the same figure, the intercept of the 'surface' semicircle with 
the real axis allows us again to evaluate the bulk resistance. 
In figure 3, concerning the highest temperature range, the arc due to electrode 
contributions progressively disappears; however , 
once more it is possible to evaluate 
the bulk resistance from the cusp between the arc due to the bulk and the frequency- 
dependent part of the impedance diagram, possibly deriving from diffusion effects [8], 
It is noteworthy that the bulk and electrode contributions have already been 
unequivocally attributed by measurements 
performed on samples of various thicknesses 
and with different surface conditions [5].

sample oriented along the z axis. T,

high-temperature range is reported. 
3. Results and discussion 
The results are summarised in the Arrhenius plot in figure 4 showing a typical measure- 
ment of a Sawyer PQ sample. Data are reported between 240 and 1500K with an 
enlarged picture of the highest-temperature range. In the same figure we have also 
indicated the temperature T1 
= 846 K of the transition from a- to /3-quartz and the 
temperature T2 
= 1140 K of the second transition from /3-quartz to the tridymite phase. 
The measurements performed from 500 to 1500K show three distinct conduction 
regimes with different slopes. The activation energies are E,, E2(q), 
E2(ty), 
where the 
abbreviations q and ty refer to quartz and tridymite, respectively. The values are El = 
1.32 f 
0.01 eV in the 500-700 K range, E,(q) = 0.67 k 0.01 eV at 700 K < T < 
1140 K 
and E,(ty) = 0.27 k 0.01 eV at 1140 K < T < 
1500 K. While the first two activation 
energies, El and E2(q), 
substantially confirm data already published [ 5 ] ,  
E,(ty) is per- 
tinent to a new high-temperature conduction regime, here explored for the first time. 
Finally, the lowest-temperature 
measurements between 240 and 280 K, obtained with 
an x-rayed sample, show an activation energy of 0.26 -+ 0.02 eV, which we call E3. 
The former interpretation [5] 
of the experimental results up to 1200K, briefly 
commented on above, featured as an essential point the association equilibria of sub- 
stitutional A1 and alkali ions compensating for the charge deficiency. The exceedingly 
low migration energy E, evaluated on the basis of these assumptions and the difficulty 
of interpreting the activation energy of the RIC regime in the same framework as

Figure 5. Minimum potential surfaces of a 
Na+ ion as a function of its location along 
thezaxis: pointsA,farfrom thealuminium 
impurity; points B, in the vicinity of an 
aluminium ion. (From [7].) 
the ionic transport phenomenon at T > 
500 K were weak aspects of the proposed 
interpretation. 
The new results at 1200 K < T < 1500 
K and specifically the low value of the acti- 
vation energy E,(ty) indicate that we are dealing with an extrinsic phenomenon in the 
whole range explored until now and suggest that a different transport picture should be 
considered. The new interpretative scheme that we propose is based on the model first 
proposed by Stevels and Volger [6] and later quantitatively discussed by Breton and 
Girardet [7]; at the moment, it seems to give a comprehensive picture of the transport 
mechanisms operating in the various temperature ranges (inclusive of RIC). 
J 
in rneir paper, areton anu uiraruet useu a numerical proceuure to calculate me 
interaction potential energy of an M+ ion (M = Li, Na, K) located in a quartz crystal 
containing an A1 centre; this calculation included electrostatic, induction, dispersion 
and short-range 
contributions. 
Two sets of results are shown in figure 2 and figure 3 of [7], the latter being in 
qualitative agreement with dielectric loss data; the improvement appears to be due to 
the choice of Lennard-Jones parameters consistent with the effective sizes of the ionic 
radii determined in oxides [9]. Further considerations on the choice of the Lennard- 
Jones parameters might improve the quantitative agreement (up to now rather poor) 
with the experimental 
parameters relative to the depths of the potential wells which we 
measured and are reported below. 
Our figure 5 coincides with figure 3 of [7] and shows the potential variations that a 
Na+ ion finds along the z axis of quartz in the following two cases: case A, in an 
unperturbed lattice, far from an aluminium impurity ion; case B, in the vicinity of an 
uncompensated Al. In case A the calculated depth [7], 0.27 eV, is strikingly similar to 
the value of E3 
found by us in the RIC conditions, in which aluminium is compensated by 
a hole and the free Na+ moves in a potential such as points A in figure 5. 
In this situation the dependence of the conductivity on temperature is governed by 
the simple formula 
aT = 
A exp( -E,/kT) 
(1) 
where A is a constant 
and E,, the migration energy along an unperturbed 
z-axis channel, 
corresponds to E3 = 
0.27 
eV in figure 4. 
In unirradiated quartz at T > 
500 K, A1 is 
6926 
M Martini et a1 
compensated by the alkali ion and so, to have an ionic carrier, one needs to give an 
energy inclusive of association and migration contributions. Equation (1) 
then becomes 
where E, is the association energy of the AI-M pair. 
The form of the potential wells in the vicinity of an aluminium impurity (figure 5 ,  
points B) suggests an interpretation for our results in the range 500 K < T < 1200 K, 
and specifically for the modification at 700 K of the activation energy from 1.32 
eV to 
0.67 eV. In fact, we propose that in the lower-temperature range the Na+ ions, bound 
to Al, are mostly located at the deeper potential minimum: the total activation energy 
E, + E, in this situation, is El (see figure 5). 
At T > 
700 K, on the contrary, even if the Na+ 
is still bound to the Al, it spends most 
of the time in the farthest potential minimum and so the total energy E2(q) 
to be spent 
in order to activate the conduction process is lower, owing to a smaller association 
contribution, E, remaining unchanged. 
It has to be noted that in this case there is less agreement between our experimental 
data and the values calculated in [7] than that found for the migration situation; 
while 
our activation energies are El = 1.32 
eV and E2(q) 
= 0.67 eV, respectively, the cor- 
responding calculated heights are El = 1.15 eV and E2 
= 0.99 eV. 
However, from a general point of view, our interpretation is consistent with the 
shape of the potential wells. A different choice of the Lennard-Jones parameters could 
improve the quantitative agreement. When the transition from @-quartz 
to tridymite 
takes place, there is a significant opening of the crystal structure and a substantial 
increase in the radius of the z-axis channels [lo, 111. It is quite clear that the depth of 
the wells both near and far from A1 impurity ions are diminished and so the association 
and migration contributions to E2(ty) 
are both lower than those pertaining to E2(q). 
On the contrary, at the a-to-@-quartz 
transition, occurring at 846 K, no 
modifications 
occur in the conduction process (see figure 4); this is consistent with the fact that this 
transition does not produce a significant enlargement of the radius of the z-axis channels 
[lo, 111. Our previous discussion does not attribute any physical meaning to the fact, 
apparently quite striking, that the numerical values of E3 
and E2(ty) 
are almost identical. 
As already described, we interpret E3 as a pure migration energy and E,(ty) as the 
dissociation plus migration energy in tridymite. 
Another possibleinterpretation 
could be that at T > 1140 
K the alkali ions are almost 
completely dissociated and thus E2(ty) 
is the pure migration energy analogous to that 
found in the RIC situation. This interpretation is, however, in conflict with the fact that, 
as seen before, the structure of the tridymite is much more open and thus one should 
expect that the migration energy in this allotropic form of SiO,, 
is lower than in a-quartz. 
Furthermore, the assumption that the alkali ions are completely free at 1140 K implies 
that A1 ions are compensated and this seems quite arbitrary. 
In conclusion, the interpretation suggested here is a unifying picture of the high- and 
low-temperature 
conductivity data, but more theoretical work along the lines of [7] is 
needed to confirm it. From an experimental point of view, higher-temperature measure- 
ments are planned; in this way, it would be possible to complete the phenomenological 
picture by observing the behaviour of the conduction due to intrinsic processes.
