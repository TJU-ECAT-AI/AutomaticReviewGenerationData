A combined experimental and ﬁrst principles study of the 2  1-reconstructed rutile TiO2011
surface is presented. Our results provide evidence that the surface structure is described by a model that
includes onefold coordinated (titanyl) oxygen atoms giving rise to double bonded Ti—
—O species. These
species should play a special role in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the TiO2011 surface.

Titanium dioxide is a promising photocatalyst for the
remediation of pollutants and the photoelectrochemical
conversion of solar energy [1]. These and a wide variety of
other attractive applications have stimulated a concerted
effort to investigate the atomic-scale properties of
TiO2 [2–5]. We present work that is motivated by the
growing evidence of a dramatic face dependence in the
photocatalytic activity of TiO2 [6–8]. For certain photo-
catalytic oxidation reactions, the f011g facets of polycrys-
talline rutile TiO2 samples are particularly active, and it
has been speculated that a special atomic conﬁguration on
TiO2011 alters either the efﬁciency with which photo-
generated carriers are trapped at the surface or the rate at
which they are transferred at the solid-liquid interface
[7]. We want to ﬁnd out what this special conﬁguration
might be. In a combined experimental and theoretical
study we show that the rutile TiO2011 surface exhibits
a 2  1 reconstruction and is distinct from other TiO2
surfaces by the presence of onefold coordinated (titanyl)
oxygen atoms.We suggest that these species play a special
role in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the
TiO2011 surface.
The coordination of surface atoms is a decisive factor
in the surface chemistry of metal oxides [9,10]. In bulk
TiO2 the titanium atoms are surrounded by octahedra of
six oxygen atoms. The various crystallographic modiﬁ-
cations of TiO2 differ in the level of distortion and the
stacking sequence of these octahedra. Oxygen atoms have
three Ti neighbors in all TiO2 crystal structures.Virtually
all stable 1  1 terminated TiO2 surfaces contain two-
fold coordinated O atoms and ﬁvefold coordinated
Ti atoms [2]. (This would also be the case for bulk-
terminated TiO2011-1  1; see the bottom of the
model in Fig. 1.) Such undercoordinated Ti(5) atoms are
preferred adsorption sites for a variety of molecules. So
far, the TiO2011 surface has been investigated only in a
somewhat indirect fashion. Based on an early low-energy
electron diffraction (LEED) study [11], it was concluded
that TiO2001 forms 011-2  1 oriented facets upon
annealing to intermediate temperatures. While the sur-
face chemistry of such ‘‘(011)-faceted’’ TiO2 has been
thoroughly tested with a large variety of organic mole-
cules [9] and exhibits a high photocatalytic activity [12],
the speciﬁc details on the arrangement and coordination
of surface atoms is not known.
All experiments in this work were performed in ultra-
high vacuum at a base pressure of 1  1010 mbar.
Polished TiO2011 samples were cleaned by sputtering
and subsequent annealing in the range of 500–850 C.
Cleanliness of the surface was checked by low-energy
He ion scattering. Empty-states scanning tunneling mi-
croscopy (STM) images were acquired with positive
sample bias voltages. During STM, the sample was held
close to room temperature. Photoemission measurements
were performed at the Center for Advanced Microstruc-
tures and Devices (CAMD) on the 3m-TGM and the PGM
beam lines.
LEED indicates a 2  1 reconstruction with the 0; 1
2
superstructure spots along the 	100
 direction (see inset
of Fig. 2). This reconstruction was observed up to the
highest annealing temperatures achievable in the experi-
mental setup (850 C). The 2n-1; 0 spots were absent for
all electron energies consistent with the glide plane sym-
metry present in the bulk TiO2 structure. This glide plane
symmetry is maintained by our model of the surface

reconstruction. STM shows surfaces with wide terraces
separated by single-layer height steps (Fig. 2). STM
shows alternating dark and bright rows along the 	0
11
direction, with a periodicity of 9 A
˚ and an apparent
corrugation of 2 A
˚ across these rows. For lower annealing
temperatures, antiphase domain boundaries are occasion-
ally visible; one of them is marked AP in Fig. 2.
Interestingly, the TiO2011-2  1 surface investi-
gated here is fully oxidized under typical preparation
conditions. Displayed in Fig. 3 are photoemission spectra
of the valence band region. Results from TiO2110-
1  1 and TiO2011-1  2 samples are shown for
comparison. The upper set of spectra was taken at 48 eV
,
where Ti-derived states are emphasized by resonant
photoemission effects [2]. On rutile 110-1  1, a few
percent of the ‘‘bridging’’ O(2) atoms can be easily
removed by annealing in vacuo and give rise to a defect
state in the 3 eV band gap (see arrow in Fig. 3). These
point defects play a special role in adsorption processes
[3–5]. Applying exactly the same preparation conditions
to TiO2011-1  2 does not result in a defect state,
indicating a stoichiometric surface.
In the attempt to ﬁnd a structural model capable to
explain the experimental observations, we performed
density functional theory calculations within the Car-
Parrinello approach [13,14], using the Perdew-Burke-
Ernzerhof
[15] exchange-correlation
functional
and
ultrasoft pseudopotentials [16], together with a plane-
wave expansion of the Kohn-Sham orbitals. Slab models
with both four and six Ti layers were used. The supercell
comprised two 2  1 surface cells corresponding to a
surface area of 9:27  11:00 
A2 (the theoretically opti-
mized bulk lattice parameters were taken from Ref. [17]).
All atoms in the upper three or ﬁve layers (in the case of
the four and six layer slab, respectively) were relaxed
using a second-order damped dynamics until the residual
forces were less than 0:025 eV= 
A, whereas the atoms in
the lowest layer were kept ﬁxed in their bulk positions.
The use of a thicker slab was found important for the
calculation of surface energies, for which we followed the
procedure described in Ref. [18].
Many different initial geometries were constructed and
optimized, with either stoichiometric or partially re-
duced surfaces. All resulting structures were found to
have surface energies larger than the relaxed unrecon-
structed slab, with the single exception of the model
shown in Fig. 1. Besides being more favorable than the
nonreconstructed surface, this model was also found to be
extremely robust with respect to either simulated anneal-
ing treatments or change of the initial starting geometry
for the optimization procedure. The 2  1 structure in
Fig. 1 is perfectly stoichiometric and its main character-
istic is the presence of onefold coordinated oxygen atoms,
O(1), with corresponding Ti—O1 bond distances of

˚. Such bond-lengths are 0:3 
A shorter than typi-
cal Ti—O bonds, and essentially correspond to Ti—O
double bonds (denoted Ti—
—O in the following). Al-
though no Ti—
—O species have been so far reported on
TiO2 surfaces, Ti—
—O is known to occur in a variety of
Ti(IV)-containing compounds, such as complex oxides
and titanosilicate materials [19,20], as well as at the edges
of TiO2 nanoparticles [21], and are usually associated to a
square-pyramidal coordination environment of Ti atoms,
similar to that of the topmost Ti atoms in Fig. 1. The
titanyl O(1) atoms form zig-zag surface chains along
the 	01
1
 direction, and, between different chains along
the 	0
11
 direction, wide ‘‘valleys’’ exposing ﬁvefold
coordinated Ti atoms, Ti(5), are present. All other surface
atoms are fully coordinated.
The electronic density of states (DOS) for the Ti—
—O
double bond model is shown in Fig. 4, where it is com-
pared to an analogous calculation for the TiO2110 sur-
face [22]. The most relevant difference between the two
calculated curves is at the upper edge of the O2p va-
lence band, where a well-deﬁned peak is present for the
011 surface, originating from the O1 titanyl atoms
(see arrow in Fig. 4). Comparison of this theoretical result
with experiment is not straightforward due to the strong
dependence of the photoemission spectra on the photon
energy h. It is, however, remarkable that a pronounced
shoulder at the upper edge of the O2p band is seen for
the TiO2011-2  1 surface but not for the TiO2110
one at h  26 eV [see Fig. 3(b)].
Several experimental observations give additional
credibility to the proposed model. First, high-resolution
STM (Fig. 5) shows that the rows consist of bright spots,
arranged in a zig-zag pattern. The calculated empty-state
image [22,23] agrees very well with experimental results.
Interestingly, the bright spots correspond to the position
of the titanyl groups; this is at variance with analogous
images for other TiO2 surfaces where typically the Ti5
atoms are seen in empty-states STM images [24]. This
difference can be attributed to the fact that on the
011 surface the outermost Ti atoms are chemically/
coordinatively saturated so that the geometrical effects
[highly protruding O(1) atoms] become dominant.
Second, the position of adsorbates is compatible with
the model displayed in Fig. 1. We exposed the surface to
formic acid (HCOOH), which is a well-established test
molecule for probing Lewis acid/base adsorption reac-
tions on TiO2 surfaces [2]. The undercoordinated Ti(5)
atoms in the valleys act as Lewis-acid sites, whereas the
strongly bound O(1) atoms and the threefold coordinated
O atoms on top of the rows are expected to block adsorp-
tion. The dosage of small amounts of HCOOH at room
temperature induces bright protrusions in STM (labeled F
in Fig. 6). The exact bonding geometry of formic acid on
TiO2011-1  2 will be the topic of a future paper; here
it is noteworthy that adsorbate-induced features are
clearly located between the rows, in agreement with the
position of the Ti(5) sites in the model. Third, the obser-
vation that TiO2011-2  1 is hard to reduce (Fig. 3) is
also in-line with the proposed model. The Ti—
—O double
bonds formed by the surface O(1) atoms are hard to break
by simply heating the sample.
The Ti—
—O species on TiO2011-2  1 distinguish
this system from all the other single-crystalline TiO2
surfaces that have been characterized so far. It is thus sug-
gestive that they may play a major role in the enhanced
photocatalytic activity of this face. The photocatalytic
process starts with the excitation of an electron-hole
pair across the band gap. These electrons/holes may mi-
grate to the surface where, in the simplest picture, they
may reduce/oxidize different adsorbed species [1]. The
electron and hole recombine with a high probability,

however, which makes the process rather inefﬁcient.
‘‘Surface trapping sites’’ increase the lifetime of the
electron/hole, and it is probable that either the Ti—
—O
species themselves, or a molecule that is strongly bound
at such a site [21], act as efﬁcient trapping sites. As a
matter of fact, our calculations indicate that the states at
the upper edge of the valence band are localized at the
surface O(1) atoms (see Fig. 4). Therefore these atoms
should be able to efﬁciently trap the photogenerated
holes and readily oxidize acceptor species present on
the surface.
With this Letter we have shown how to prepare a well-
characterized surface with a high coverage of titanyl
groups. This is an important ﬁrst step for applying surface
science techniques that are capable of unravelling reac-
tion mechanisms with the high level of detail that is
needed in order to thoroughly understand the special
role these species may play in (photo)catalytic processes.
