Abstract
Defects at transition metal (TM) and rare earth (RE) oxide surfaces, neutral oxygen vacancies in particular, play a major role in a variety
of technological applications. This is the motivation of numerous studies of partially reduced oxide surfaces. We review, discuss, and compare
theoretical data for structural and electronic properties and energetic quantities related to the formation of oxygen defects at TM and RE oxide
surfaces using TiO2, ZrO2, V2O5, and CeO2 as examples. Bulk defects, as far as relevant for comparison with the properties of reduced surfaces,
are brieﬂy reviewed. Special attention is given to the fate of the electrons left in the system upon vacancy formation and the ability of state-of-the-
art quantum-mechanical methods to provide reliable energies and an accurate description of the electronic structure of the partially reduced oxide
systems.

1. Introduction
Transition metal (TM) oxides constitute an important
class of inorganic solids exhibiting a very wide variety of
structures and electronic and magnetic properties that are due
to the nature of the outer d states [1,2]. They are of great
importance for a number of a technological applications such as
heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion-protective coating of metals
and microelectronic devices. Point defects in TM oxides such as
vacancies and interstitials account for the transport properties of
ionic solids. Furthermore, bulk defects play a signiﬁcant role in
determining surface properties where, for example, annealing
to high temperatures is necessary. In addition, an important
issue in TM oxide-based heterogeneous catalysis is the role
of surface defects in determining the activity and selectivity
of the catalyst. The existence of reduced surface centers —
and hence the presence of neutral oxygen vacancies — is
sometimes necessary for any activity. Ultimately, the potential
of TM oxides in applications is related to the ability of the
metal atoms to assume multiple oxidation states — for instance,
vanadium can have the oxidation states II, III, IV, and V. This
characteristic is not exclusive to transition (d) metal oxides
and a representative example is given by ceria-based materials
[3]. Many of the key properties of ceria, a rare earth (RE)
oxide, arise from the fact that cerium has two stable oxidation
states, namely, III and IV, in which f electron states are partially
occupied or empty, respectively.
Oxygen vacancies at (TM and RE) oxide surfaces (or
in the bulk) alter the geometric and electronic structure as
well as chemical properties of the host system. In turn,
the host system will largely determine the properties of the
vacancies. The expectation that a fundamental understanding
(i.e., microscopic) of these defects will help to elucidate the
effect that they have on the system’s functionality has been
the driving force for pursuing experimental and theoretical
research on reduced materials. For years oxygen vacancies have
been detected and investigated using a variety of spectroscopic
techniques, however, much has been learned recently about the
structure of defective surfaces using scanning probe techniques.
In spite of that, there are still difﬁculties in the experimental
determination of the vacancy-induced lattice relaxations, and
information about the vacancy formation energy (hence defect
stability) is not always experimentally obtainable. Therefore,
a great number of theoretical studies on oxygen removal
from TM and RE oxides have appeared in the literature. In
particular, isolated oxygen vacancies at differently oriented
surfaces and in the bulk have received much attention. Strong
interactions can occur between defects, causing them to cluster
or order. Yet, isolated defects (or a low concentration of
them) have been the natural starting point for the theoretical
studies.
In this article, we consider the formation of oxygen
vacancies at TM and RE oxide surfaces using TiO2, ZrO2,
V2O5, and CeO2 as examples. The partially reduced bulk
oxides are also considered. The interest on these particular
oxide surfaces is their importance for heterogeneous catalysis
and other industrial applications. Their speciﬁc applications
that are the deeper motivation for most of the performed work
will be brieﬂy mentioned in each of the sections that cover
basic properties of the oxides. The focus is on theoretical
studies and the more recent literature (after 1990). Inclusion
of experimental studies would render a review unmanageably
large given the vast number of experimental studies published
since 1990 on oxygen defects for the systems considered.
Nevertheless, the key experimental ﬁndings on the properties
of the reduced systems are mentioned. One question of
fundamental interest is: What is the electronic structure of
the reduced oxides systems? In other words, when neutral
oxygen atoms are removed, which states do the electrons left
in the system populate? Another question, which is perhaps
more practical, is: What is the energy required to form the
oxygen defects? Answering these questions has provided a very
strong motive to investigate the nature of neutral oxygen defects
in the speciﬁc chosen systems at the atomistic level using
density functional theory (DFT); see, e.g., Refs. [4–29] (TiO2),
Refs. [29–35] (ZrO2), Refs. [36–42] (V2O5), and Refs. [43–
M.V. Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. / Surface Science Reports 62 (2007) 219–270

54] (CeO2). Different exchange–correlation functionals have
been applied, including the local density approximation (LDA)
and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for exchange
and correlation [55–57], as well as hybrid functionals such
as Becke–Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP), which contain a portion
of exact exchange (20%) [58,59]. The Hartree–Fock (HF) and
DFT+U approaches [60–63] have also been used. Defects have
been modelled using either (embedded) cluster or the supercell
approach, i.e., applying periodic boundary conditions.
While several theoretical articles and reviews that compare
defective wide-gap oxides such as SiO2, MgO, SnO2, α-Al2O3,
and HfO2 (i.e., non-TM oxides in particular) were written in
recent years [64–71], a comprehensive review of theoretical
insights into oxygen vacancy properties in TM and RE oxides
in general and in those considered in this report in particular,
is lacking. In this report, an attempt is made to critically
review the ability of different computational methods to provide
reliable (geometrical and electronic) structures and energies for
oxygen defects for selected examples of TM and RE oxides.
The four oxides, TiO2, ZrO2, V2O5, and CeO2 are discussed
in Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. Each section starts with
the basic structural and electronic properties of the bulk and
selected low-index surfaces. Then the important experimental
ﬁndings on the reduced systems are summarized. In the
following subsections the theoretical insights into the structural
and electronic properties and energetic quantities related to
the formation of surface oxygen defects and in the bulk are
reviewed and discussed. The article ends with a comparison
of the systems considered and an outlook of the remaining
challenges for ﬁrst-principles studies in the ﬁeld of oxygen
defects in oxide materials.
2. Models and methods
In the so-called periodic approach to study solids, bulk and
surfaces, the Schr¨
odinger equation is (approximately) solved
for the atoms of a unit cell containing a given number of atoms,
subject to periodic boundary conditions in three dimensions.
Surfaces are modelled in a supercell approach. Here one
considers the periodic repetition of a two-dimensional periodic
slab of the crystal together with a sufﬁciently thick vacuum
layer, in the direction parallel to the surface normal. Hence,
in the periodic approach one models two surfaces, one at
each side of the slab. The thickness of the slab and vacuum
layer are chosen so that the mutual interaction between the
two surfaces of a slab and between those of periodic images,
respectively, vanish. The presence of a point defect in the
surface unit cell (typically on one side of the slab) results in its
periodic repetition and a high concentration of surface defects.
Increasing the size of the unit cell in the surface plane reduces
the defect concentration, but increases the computational cost.
Similar considerations apply to defects in the bulk unit cell,
repeating in three directions. We recognize that the defect
concentrations accessible to computer simulations are typically
much higher than those encountered in experiments.
An alternative approach is the use of cluster models. Here
only a ﬁnite number of atoms are explicitly considered to
describe a part of a solid system whereas the rest of the crystal
is treated by embedding techniques. There is an important
advantage in the use of clusters in describing point defects —
an inﬁnite dilution is considered. Ideally there should be no
dependence of the calculated properties on the embedding, size,
and shape of the cluster used, thus careful checks have to be
performed.
Density functional theory has become a widely used tool
for calculations of the properties of solids and molecules,
employing both periodic and cluster approaches. Standard
implementations of DFT are based on the Kohn–Sham
equations and use LDA or GGA for the exchange–correlation
functional. Three GGA functionals, namely PW91 [55],
PBE [56], and RPBE [57], have been used in studies
of oxygen defects in the TM and RE oxide systems
considered
in
this
review.
A
number
of
failures
are
known to exist in LDA and all currently used GGA
functionals, for example the underestimation of band gaps, the
gross overestimation of electron delocalization and metallic
character, the overestimation of atomization energies of
molecules and solids, and the underestimation of energy
barriers for molecular reactions. These problems are a
consequence of employing approximations to the unknown
exchange–correlation functional. Another source of error is the
lack of exact cancellation of the Coulombic self-interaction,
which stabilizes solutions with delocalization of spin density
and, as a result, the electronic structure of highly localized
magnetic systems is not correctly reproduced. For these
reasons, the description of oxygen defects on TM and RE
oxide surfaces and in the bulk employing standard DFT is
expected to show deﬁciencies. These will particularly relate to
the electronic properties of the reduced systems, speciﬁcally,
the location of the electrons left in the system upon reduction,
the population of speciﬁc electronic states by these electrons,
resulting in occupied states in the band gap, and the actual
position of these (defect) states within the gap. Shortcomings
are also anticipated in the defect formation energy. In this
report we illustrate the merits and limits of local and gradient-
corrected functionals as applied to reduced TiO2, ZrO2, V2O5,
and CeO2 bulk and surfaces.
The above-mentioned inadequacies of GGA functionals
can be partly removed by admixture of a ﬁxed amount of
Fock exchange to the exchange–correlation functional. These
hybrid functionals give signiﬁcant improvement over GGA for
many molecular properties and are very popular in molecular
quantum chemistry. Possibly the most widely used hybrid
functional is B3LYP [58,59]. Despite the important impact
of hybrid functionals on molecular quantum chemistry, their
applications to periodic solids used to be linked to Gaussian
basis sets (see, e.g., Refs. [23,25,72–77]). Due to progress
in plane-wave based algorithms [78,79] and computer speed,
hybrid functionals such as HSE03 [80–82] and PBE0 [83–
85] have been implemented recently in widely used plane-
wave basis set codes [86–89]. The hybrid (periodic and
cluster) approach has been successfully applied to selected
defective TM oxide surfaces [12,23,25,40]. Compared to
GGA functionals, an improved description of the electronic
222

structure and more accurate energies have been obtained. The
use of cluster models, in particular, allows for the explicit
inclusion of correlation effects employing approaches such the
Møller–Plesset perturbation theory. The application of such
approaches to the electronic structure of point defects at TM
or RE oxide surfaces is, however, still rare [90].
A number of more pragmatic approaches have been
developed to address the deep seated problems of local
and gradient-corrected functionals such as the self-interaction
correction (SIC) [91] and the DFT + U approach. This latter
method was originally proposed by Anisimov and co-workers
[60–63] to account for correlations resulting from strong on-
site Coulomb and exchange interactions, as an extension of
the LDA approach based on the lessons learned from Hubbard
model studies [92–94]. In practice, in these DFT(LDA/GGA)+
U approaches one identiﬁes a set of atomic-like orbitals that are
treated with an orbital-dependent potential and an associated
screened on-site Coulomb and exchange interaction parameter,
U and J, respectively [95]. The method, although initially tied
to the linear mufﬁn-tin orbital (LMTO) approach, has been
reformulated for different basis sets [96–99]. The DFT + U
approach has been applied recently to partially reduced RE
systems [48–54]. Yet, questions regarding the proper way of
specifying the atomic-like orbitals, and of deriving the best
value for the so-called effective Hubbard-U parameter (U ′ =
U −J) are still under debate.
Last, but not least, generation of the (norm-conserving
or ultra-soft) pseudopotentials used in periodic plane-wave
calculations (see Refs. [100,101] and references therein) still
is a tricky, cumbersome, and error-prone task. Ill-behaved
pseudopotentials may affect the description of defective
systems, the electronic structure in particular. Yet, deﬁcient
pseudopotentials are easily spotted if results are compared to
those obtained using all-electron methods. Examples of this and
the above-mentioned aspects of calculations on reduced TM
and RE oxides systems using different models and methods will
be discussed in more detail in following sections.

3. Titanium oxide
3.1. TiO2 applications and basic information
Titanium dioxide is the model system in the surface science
of TM oxides [2]. It is by far the most extensively studied
TM oxide system (see Ref. [102] and references therein). Well
ordered, nearly perfect surfaces can be produced relatively
easily; it is used as a support of both metal and oxide catalysts,
as a photocatalyst, as a gas sensor, as a corrosion-protective
coating, and in electric devices such as varistors.
Titanium dioxide crystallizes into three main phases, rutile,
anatase, and brookite. However, only rutile and anatase play any
role in the applications of TiO2. In both structures, the basic
building block consists of Ti atoms surrounded by six oxygen
atoms in a more or less distorted octahedral conﬁguration
(see Fig. 1). The bulk unit cell compositions are Ti2O4 and
Ti4O8, respectively. In all three structures, the stacking of the
octahedra results in threefold coordinated oxygen atoms. Rutile
is the most abundant polymorph in nature. Most crystal growth
techniques yield TiO2 in the rutile phase, thus this phase has
been studied extensively. Relative to rutile there are fewer
investigations of the anatase phase, although it constitutes most
of the commercially produced material. In the following, if
the phase is not explicitly mentioned, rutile is meant. Both
rutile and anatase are insulators with band gaps of 3.0 and
3.2 eV, respectively [103]. Anatase is less dense and less
stable than rutile at ambient pressures and temperatures (see
Ref. [104] and references therein). The transition temperature
depends on a variety of factors including impurities, sample
history and crystal size. Indeed, nanocrystalline TiO2 may be
phase selected by controlling the particle size, as well as other
experimental conditions such as temperature [105].
The oxygen terminated (110) and (101) oriented (1 ×
1) surfaces are the most stable rutile and anatase surfaces,
respectively [102,106–108]. Both surfaces have sixfold and
ﬁvefold coordinated Ti atoms (Ti(6) and Ti(5)), as well
as threefold and twofold coordinated O atoms (O(3), O(2),
respectively, see Fig. 2). The removal of the latter, so-called
bridging oxygen atoms is a subject of much interest and debate.
3.2. Experimental ﬁndings on oxygen vacancies
The titanium–oxygen phase diagram is very rich with
a variety of crystal structures [109]. When point defects
(predominantly oxygen vacancies) are created in the bulk or
at surfaces, they cause important changes in the electronic
structure that affect the performance of the material in
various applications. Consequently, the properties of reduced
TiO2 have been the subject of considerable experimental and
theoretical interests [7–19,22,23,25–29]. The sheer number
of experimental investigations, in particular, excludes a
comprehensive listing, and we refer the reader to the recent
review by Diebold [102].
The defect structure of TiO2−x is a complex issue because
a family of stable Magn´
eli phases [110,111] is found to occur
between Ti2O3 and TiO2. At low concentrations (x < 10−4) the

oxygen vacancies are accommodated as point defects while for
higher degrees of reduction crystallographic shear (CS) planes
are formed, and the point defects eliminated. It is beyond the
scope of this work to discuss the formation of CS planes and
the most stable structure for a given stoichiometry.
Heating TiO2 bulk single crystals in vacuum leads to
deviations from the 1:2 stoichiometry as ﬁrstly reported by
Gray et al. [112], and is accompanied by visible color changes
from transparent to light and, in turn, dark blue [113]. These
deviations were later attributed to conduction electrons trapped
at Ti sites forming (electron paramagnetic resonance) EPR-
active TiIII species [114]. The EPR studies revealed that darker
rutile crystals exhibit higher concentrations of TiIII centers
associated to bulk defects such as crystallographic shear planes
[113], that may extend all the way to the surface [115]. The
characteristic EPR signals attributed to TiIII ions were also
observed after excitation of anatase TiO2 samples with UV light
[116], but the signal may disappear at increasing temperature
if the particles are small [117]. Reduced TiO2 crystals exhibit
n-type doping, and are widely used in photocatalysis (see
Ref. [118] and references therein).
There is overwhelming spectroscopic and chemical evidence
for the presence of oxygen defects on (rutile and anatase)
samples sputtered and annealed in UHV. These are attributed
to bridging oxygen vacancies. Their concentration is reported
as several per cent [119,120]. Anatase surfaces show, however,
less tendency to release lattice oxygen atoms. For the (110)
rutile surface, in particular, scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) has uncovered a large amount of information about
oxygen defects in the bridging oxygen [001] oriented rows that
includes their diffusion and adsorption on the defective surface
[102,121–125]. The latter topic has blossomed after Haruta’s
discovery [126] that nanosized TiO2 supported gold clusters
exhibit unique catalytic properties [127–129]. It is assumed that
the presence of defects on the substrate plays an important role
in the catalytic activity (see additional references in the recent
survey by Diebold [130]), but experimental evidence has not
yet been provided.
Regardless of the location of the oxygen vacancy (i.e., in the
bulk or at a surface) the presence of TiIII ions in the reduced
systems has been reported. In the following, we summarize the
key features of the experimental evidence for their existence
224
M.V. Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. / Surface Science Reports 62 (2007) 219–270
on reduced TiO2 surfaces. The ultraviolet photoemission
spectroscopy (UPS) spectra of single-crystal surfaces contain
a band gap feature at ∼1 eV below the conduction band
edge, which has been interpreted in terms of occupied Ti 3d
states [131,132], a view supported by the resonant behavior
of UPS across the range of photon energies corresponding
to the Ti 3p–3d excitation threshold [133–136]. Moreover,
UPS measurements on preparation induced reduced rutile (110)
surface (e.g., annealing or Ar bombardment) showed a band
gap state at 0.7–0.9 eV below the conduction band [137,138]
for low defect concentration that moves towards the bottom of
the conduction band as the defect concentration increases [139,
140]. This is consistent with EELS studies [141]; the signature
of surface oxygen vacancies is a loss feature at about 0.9 eV.
Furthermore, a shoulder in the Ti 2p spectra seen in X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was attributed to TiIII ions,
and the lack of surface conductivity also evidence the localized
nature of the additional electrons [102].
3.3. Reduced TiO2 rutile (110) surface
There are two possible types of states that the electrons left
in TiO2 systems (bulk and surface) upon reduction can occupy:
delocalized conduction band states (its bottom formed by Ti
3d states) which leads to a metallic ground state, or localized
Ti 3d states in the band gap connected with an insulating
ground state. The latter type corresponds to the experimental
observations. TiIV ions in titania are in the d0 state, TiIII ions
formed upon oxygen removal are in the d1 state. The excess
charge localization seriously challenges DFT calculations as
anticipated in Section 2, and shown next and in Section 3.5.
3.3.1. Structure relaxation and electronic structure
Studies of reduced TiO2 surfaces using Hartree–Fock or
hybrid DFT methods, where the Fock exchange is partially
mixed with the DFT exchange, are relatively scarce [8,
12,23,25]. Mackrodt et al. [8] performed spin-unrestricted
Hartree–Fock (UHF) calculations [142] of the fully reduced
(1 × 1)TiO2(110) surface (Θdef = 1) that included relaxation
of the surface structure upon reduction. The surface model
contained three layers (all were allowed to relax). The term
layer is used for the repeating O–Ti2O2–O unit (see Fig. 2).
For other computational details see Table 1. The largest
displacements were those of the oxygen atoms in the outermost
Ti–O plane, which moved outwards by up to ∼0.3 ˚
A.
The UHF calculations led to an antiferromagnetic insulating,
ground state, i.e., an open-shell singlet. The excess-electron
density was located solely at the surface and evenly distributed
between the nearest and next-nearest neighbors to the defect.
The occupied states associated with the Ti(4) (Ti(6) before
defect formation, cf. Fig. 1) and Ti(5) atoms were entirely
separated from each other. (Note that the fourfold coordination
results of the fact that Θdef = 1). They were located in the band
gap within ∼1–2 eV of the top of the valence band.
Bredow and Pacchioni [12] modelled the isolated defect
limit for the TiO2(110) surface using cluster models, and
discussed the defect formation energy (see Section 3.3.2).
Clusters of different size were either embedded in point
charges (Ti4O8 and Ti10O20) or terminated by hydrogen
atoms [Ti4O8 (H2O)8, Ti10O20 (H2O)12, Ti17O34 (H2O)19].
The oxygen defect was created by removing the central
bridging oxygen atom from the surface. The spin-polarized
unrestricted (UKS) calculations were performed using two
hybrid functionals with 20% and 100% Fock exchange, B3LYP
and HFLYP, respectively (Table 1). The structures of the
reduced clusters were only partially reoptimized.
Removal of one oxygen atom did not result in an open-
shell singlet ground state, but in a triplet state (Table 1). For
the largest (unrelaxed) system the energy difference between
the triplet and closed-shell singlet state was 0.39 eV. The two
unpaired electrons were almost equally distributed over the two
ﬁvefold (Ti(6) in the defect free surface) nearest neighbors to
the defect, and the two next-nearest neighbors (Ti(5)), before
structure relaxation was considered. However, after relaxation
the excess electrons localized almost entirely on the two Ti(5)
next-nearest neighbors, probably to reduce electron repulsion.
With the HFLYP functional this localization was present even in
the unrelaxed structures. Thus, localization is in part connected
with the defect-induced structural relaxations. Beyond that, the
difference between the B3LYP and HFLYP results conﬁrms the
awaited “sensitivity” of the results to the main approximations
made.
Zhang et al. [23] considered a fully reduced 5L slab (Θdef =
1.0) and applied the hybrid density functional proposed by
Moreira et al. [76] with an admixture of 13% of Fock exchange
into spin-polarized LDA. The (empirical) value of 13% was
determined by ﬁtting the calculated value of the bulk band gap
as a function of the percentage contribution of Fock exchange
to the experimental value (3.0 eV). The B3LYP functional (20%
exchange) overestimated the band gap by ∼0.5 eV. The ground
state was a triplet, but the antiferromagnetic solution (open-
shell singlet) was only 13 meV less stable. For 13% Fock
exchange within LDA, two defect states ∼2.4 eV above the top
of the valence band were predicted, i.e., approximately 0.6 eV
below the conduction band edge (cf. Table 1). The resulting spin
density is mainly localized on the Ti(4) (Ti(6) before reduction)
and Ti(5) surface atoms, with major dx2−y2 (Ti(4)) and dxz
(Ti(5)) contributions, however small density contributions are
still seen on cations belonging to the layers beneath (see Fig. 3).
Recently, Di Valentin et al. [25] performed spin-polarized
calculations using the B3LYP functional for a 4L c(2 × 4)
reduced slab (Θdef = 1/4). The structure was fully relaxed,
except for the atoms in the bottom layer which were ﬁxed at
their bulk positions. We note that in the (a′ × b′) nomenclature
of the (reduced) surface unit cells two choices are possible,
namely the a′- and b′-axis parallel to the bulk [¯
110] and [001]
directions, respectively, or viceversa. Within the former choice
the (1 × 1) surface unit cell has dimensions of
√
2a × c with
a and c the bulk lattice parameters (aexp = 4.59 ˚
A and cexp =
2.95 ˚
A) [143]. In the following, we will use this choice as the
standard nomenclature and indicate differences (if any) with the
original literature.
The c(2 × 4) structure allows for the possibility of having
inequivalent nearest and next-nearest neighbors to the defect.

The results show that rather than localizing on the two next-
nearest neighbors (Ti(5)) as predicted by Bredow and Pacchioni
[12], one electron localizes on a nearest neighbor and the other
on a next-nearest neighbor. The reason why the B3LYP cluster
and periodic calculations differ may be the limited relaxation
considered in the cluster, which signalizes the importance of
accounting for full geometry optimization. Fig. 4 shows the
spin up-projected total density of states. The states at 1.1 and
0.9 eV below the bottom of the conduction band correspond to
the occupied Ti 3d states localized on one Ti(5) and one of the
the former Ti(6) atoms, respectively.
The studies reported so far employed cluster or supercell
approaches and used exact exchange or a portion of it
(cf. Table 1). The same physical picture emerges from all
of them: The excess electrons occupy (strictly) localized Ti
3d states. The hybrid methods predicted location of these
states below the conduction band edge (0.6–1.1 eV) is in
fairly good agreement with experimental results (0.7–0.9 eV,
cf. Section 3.2). What remains experimentally unresolved is the
existence of two distinct states.
The LDA and gradient-corrected approximation have been
widely and frequently used [7,9–11,13–18,22,28]. The ﬁrst
(non-spin-polarized) self-consistent LDA calculation [144] of
reduced TiO2(110) surfaces was performed by Ramamoorthy
et al. [7] They used supercells containing three (3L) and ﬁve
layer (5L) slabs (for other computational details see Table 1).
The attention was focused on the 3L (1 × 2) and (2 × 1)
supercells, for which only one half of the bridging oxygen
atoms were absent (Θdef = 1/2), as well as on the fully
reduced (1 × 1) structure (Θdef = 1). The (2 × 1) conﬁguration
has alternate [001] oriented rows of bridging oxygen defects,
whereas the (1 × 2) has alternate oxygen defects along each
such row. The two unit cells differ with respect to the closest
distance between defects. For the (1×2) cell this equals 2·c and
is twice as large as for the (2 × 1) cell. Ramamoorthy et al. [7]
found the (1×2) structure to be lower in energy by 0.13 eV (3L
slab).
Geometry
relaxation
upon
reduction
was
considered,
however, it is likely that only the atoms in the outermost (slab)
layer were allowed to move. The resulting (1×1) geometry was
very close to that found in Ref. [8], despite those calculations
were performed using the UHF approach. In the relaxed (1 ×
2) structure, both surface Ti atoms that were bonded to the
removed bridging oxygen were displaced by 0.1 ˚
A away from
the defect along the [001] direction. Note that for lower defect
concentrations than Θdef = 1, the structure relaxations obtained
with the LDA or GGA functionals may vary from those
obtained with approaches that use exact exchange, in cases in
M.V. Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. / Surface Science Reports 62 (2007) 219–270
227
which the localization of the excess electrons as described by
the different functionals differ [25].
The electrons left at the (110) reduced surfaces (Θdef = 1/2,
1) occupy Ti 3d states localized primarily on all surface Ti
atoms. These states were found not to be separated by a gap
from the bottom of the conduction band in gross disagreement
with experiment.
Lindan et al. [9,10] considered the same systems as
Ramamoorthy et al. [7], but performed spin-polarized PW91
calculations. The defect induced surface relaxations were in
broad agreement with those of Ref. [7] (largest displacement
of ∼0.4 ˚
A for the oxygen atoms in the outermost Ti–O plane),
but the (2 × 1) structure was found to be more stable than the
(1 × 2) structure by ∼0.2 eV. This corresponds to a difference
in surface energy of 0.04 J/m2, which the authors indicated to
be at the limit of accuracy of their calculations.
Lindan et al. [9] found a triplet ground state for all structures
investigated (cf. Table 1). Large energy differences between
the (closed-shell) singlet and triplet solutions were reported
(e.g., ∼3 eV for the (2 × 1) cell). In the following, we
assume that the authors did not search for an open-shell singlet
solution if they did not mention this explicitly. For the (1 × 1)
structure, each surface Ti atom received one electron upon
reduction. Fig. 5 shows the corresponding spin-projected total
density of states. A band at 0.7–1.8 eV above the top of
valence band corresponds to the Ti 3d occupied states. The
lowest unoccupied states (not shown) are about 1.9 eV above
the valence band edge of the defect free system. Thus, the
occupied states are in the gap. Although optical properties
and band gaps are not ground-state properties, it has become
a common practice to compare DFT one electron energies
with experimentally measured quasi-particle spectra. It is well-
known that the LDA usually underestimates band gaps for
semiconductors and insulators [145,146]. For TiO2 (rutile) the
predicted LDA band gap is around 2.0 eV [147–149], (exp.:
3.0 eV). Using gradient-corrected functionals such as PW91
does not necessarily improve the results [150], and the HF
approximation yields a band gap that is three times larger than
the experimental one [151]. Therefore, we expect that the actual
position of defect states within the gap may not be accurately
predicted using any of these methods. The deviation between
the B3LYP and the experimental band gaps is less severe, as
previously mentioned.
For the (2 × 1) conﬁguration the associated occupied Ti
3d states lay 0.2–0.8 eV above the top of valence band in the
gap, whereas for the (1 × 2) conﬁguration they were higher
in energy (0.8–1.5 eV). The spin density distributions showed
that no electron localizes on surface Ti atoms that would be
ﬁvefold coordinated at the defect-free surface but on one nearest
Ti neighbor to the defect (Ti(6) before reduction), and one Ti
atom in the middle layer. We note that Lindan et al. [9] indicated
the possibility that these reduced systems have multiple minima
on the potential energy surface determined by the starting
geometry. Namely, once one electron is localized on a Ti ion
in the course of structure optimization, subsequent structural
relaxation may not be enough to allow the electron to move to
another site.

The existence of gap states is in agreement with the ﬁndings
using hybrid DFT methods and spin-polarized Hartree–Fock
[8,12,23,25],
and
in
contrast
to
those
(spin-paired)
of
Ramamoorthy et al. [7] obtained with plain DFT (cf. Table 1).
This comparison may suggest that including spin-polarization
is necessary and sufﬁcient to reproduce the observed n-type
semiconducting character of the ground state of reduced TiO2
systems (cf. Section 3.2). This qualitative agreement between
the hybrid and GGA approaches should not be assumed to exist
always. Nevertheless, it is surprising that non-spin-polarized
calculations of oxygen defects at the TiO2(110) surface are still
being published [28].
Paxton and Thiˆ
en-Nga [11] applied the spin-polarized all-
electron full-potential linear mufﬁn-tin orbital (FP-LMTO)
[152,153] method to a 3L slab model of the fully reduced
(1×1) TiO2(110) surface. Exchange and correlation was treated
within both the LDA [154,155] and PW91 approximations.
Both bulk truncated and relaxed atom positions (those reported
in Ref. [9]) were considered. In no case an occupied state in
the band gap was found (cf. Table 1). The Ti local magnetic
moments were 1.2µB and 0.6µB (LDA) for the Ti surface
atoms that were sixfold and ﬁvefold coordinated, respectively,
at the defect free surface and 0.2µB on Ti atoms of the central
layer. Thus, the excess electrons were, as a result, to some
extent delocalized. The all-electron spin-polarized calculation
by Paxton and Thiˆ
en-Nga [11] is at odds with that by
Lindan et al. [10], however, results obtained using all-electron
and pseudopotentials methods (and the same functional) are
expected to be (at least) qualitative similar. If not, one should
worry about the quality of the pseudopotential used (see later
discussion in this section).
A great amount of work [13–19] on reduced TiO2(110) over
recent years, using periodic boundary conditions and ultra-soft
pseudopotentials, has led to an understanding of the above-
stated disagreements and to an answer to the question: What is
the electronic structure of reduced TiO2 in the context of DFT-
GGA methods?

considering thicker systems will become apparent later. Among
all periodic studies on reduced TiO2(110) using gradient-
corrected functionals and (ultra-soft) pseudopotentials, the one
by Rasmussen et al. [18] is probably the most systematic
(and most accurate). They performed spin-polarized PW91
calculations and investigated defect concentrations in the range
1/6 < Θdef < 1/2 using slabs of varying thickness (3L–6L)
and (1 × 6), (1 × 4), (1 × 3), and (1 × 2), and c(2 ×
6), c(2 × 4), and c(2 × 2) unit cells. The centered cells
correspond to Θdef = 1/6, 1/4 and 1/2, respectively. At a given
concentration, with respect to the distance between defects
along the [001] direction (i.e., in the rows) both the primitive
and centered cells are identical. However, in the centered cells
the periodicity is doubled in the [¯
110] direction (i.e., a′) and
the two oxygen rows are displaced by b′ with respect to each
other. (In the original work the orientation of the a′ and b′
lattice vectors is interchanged.) The use of both primitive and
centered cells of increasing size allowed for an estimation of
defect interactions along and across the bridging rows (see
Section 3.3.2). Geometry relaxations (beyond the ﬁrst layer)
were considered in detail.
Table 2 reproduces the main atomic displacements for the
example of the (1 × 4) structure calculated with a four layer
slab of which two were relaxed (cf. Fig. 6). The Ti atoms
just below the missing O are strongly pushed sideways and
down, whereas the O atom below these two Ti atoms are
lifted upwards considerably, and relaxations in the second layer
are non-negligible. The amplitude of the displacement of the
oxygen atoms in the outermost Ti–O plane is not as large as
previously reported for 3L deﬁcient slabs at Θdef = 1/2 and
1 [7,10]. The importance of atomic relaxations for reduced
rutile TiO2(110) is also apparent in the electronic structure as
already mentioned in connection with the results of Bredow
and Pacchioni [12] and further discussed next in this section.
Nevertheless, information of the atomic structure was not in
general provided or was considered in restrictive ways.
Menetrey et al. [13], Vijay et al. [15], and Oviedo et al.
[16] performed spin-polarized PW91 calculations [156,157],
as Rasmussen et al. [18] (cf. Table 1). The former employed
(1 × 3) and (1 × 2) unit cells and a 3L slab for which motions
were restricted to the outermost layer. They also reported that
removal of bridging oxygen atoms causes substantial changes

in the positions of the remaining atoms, leading to an increase
of the Ti–Ti distance between nearest Ti neighbors to the defect
by 0.41 and 0.28 ˚
A for Θdef = 1/3 and 1/2, respectively,
in particular. Vijay et al. [15] used a (1 × 2) unit cell and
considered both Θdef = 1/2 and 1 with 3–5 layer slabs, whereas
Oviedo et al. [16] employed up to 7L slabs and (1 × 2),
(2 × 1), and (1 × 4) cells (Θdef = 1/2 and 1/4, respectively).
Vijay et al. [15] ﬁxed only the atoms in the bottom layer in
their bulk positions, i.e., the number of layers allowed to relax
varied with slab thickness. Nevertheless, they only described
the movements of the atoms in the outermost layer, which
agree with those discussed previously [7,10,13]. Oviedo et al.
[16] did not ﬁx any atom in the slabs, but did not report the
resulting geometries. Similarly, Wu et al. [17], who performed
spin-polarized calculations [158,159] with the PBE functional
using (2 × 3), (1 × 4) and (2 × 2), and (1 × 2) unit cells, where
all atoms (except those in the bottom slab layer) were allowed
to relax, did not describe the atomic displacements.
In these four most recent GGA studies [15–18] the ground
states of all oxygen deﬁcient structures considered were
triplet (cf. Table 1), in agreement with most of the earlier
investigations [9,11–13]. The (spin-paired) singlet state was
found to be less favored by a few tenths of an eV (or less)
[16,17]. Such difference qualitatively agrees with that obtained
in hybrid periodic [23] (∼0.01 eV with respect to the open-
shell singlet) and cluster [12] studies (∼0.4 eV), but it is in
disagreement with that reported by Lindan et al. [9] (about 3
M.V. Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. / Surface Science Reports 62 (2007) 219–270
229
eV). Moreover, the late GGA calculations that employed (ultra-
soft) pseudopotentials, showed a metallic ground state [15,17,
18] (cf. Table 1). The absence of Ti 3d occupied states in the
gap is in agreement with the earlier all-electron calculation of
Paxton and Thiˆ
en-Nga [11], but in contrast to the results of
Lindan et al. [9], who used norm-conserving pseudopotentials.
It is comforting to see that all-electron and pseudopotential
GGA studies do give the same answer. Ref. [18] includes a hint
that there may be some problem with the pseudopotential used
by Lindan et al. [9]. Nevertheless, while the agreement between
recent GGA studies is satisfying, they do not reproduce the
experimentally observed state in the band gap. Such a state is
consistent with the occupation of localized Ti 3d states, whereas
in the metallic state electrons are obviously delocalized. The
extent to which the excess electrons were found to spread over
the system differed considerably [15,17,18].
For example, Vijay et al. [15] evaluated the electron density
loss upon binding of one O atom to reduced (unrelaxed)
structures as a qualitative measure of the (de)localization of
the excess electrons upon reduction. Thereby assuming that
the electron density loss (when the defect is “healed”) and
gain (when the defect is created) are likely to be similar. They
calculated the electron density difference ∆ρ = ρfree −ρdef −
ρO; ρfree and ρdef are the electron densities of the clean and
(unrelaxed) reduced surfaces, respectively, and ρO that of a
free O atom at the defect’s position. ∆ρ is negative in those
regions where oxygen bonding induces a depletion of electron
density. Fig. 7 shows the result for the example of Θdef =
1/2 with (1 × 2) periodicity. The region that is depleted is
fairly delocalized over the slab. Therefore, the delocalization
of the excess electrons over many Ti atoms (i.e., not just those
connected to the bridging oxygen) was pointed out.
Rasmussen et al. [18] evaluated the actual changes in
charge density upon defect creation and found that structural
rearrangements are strongly coupled with important changes
in the electronic structure as illustrated next for the example
of the defect structure at Θdef
=
1/4. Fig. 8(a) shows
the induced charge density changes upon reduction for the
(1 × 4) structure with unrelaxed atoms positions (i.e., equal
to those in the relaxed clean TiO2(110) surface). The excess
electrons remained relatively near the defect site mostly at
the two closest surface Ti atoms. However, when atoms were
allowed to relax (cf. Fig. 8(b)), the excess electrons spread
out. The delocalization of the excess electrons increased upon
relaxation, however, a sizable amount remained at the nearby Ti
atoms. Note the different scales in Fig. 8(a) and (b). Wu et al.
[17] also found the two electrons primarily on those Ti atoms.
Consistently with these ﬁndings, the calculated density of states
of the reduced systems shows a defect related occupied state
right below the Fermi level, however, not separated by a gap
from the conduction band as already mentioned.
From the above survey we conclude that the answer to the
question on the existence of occupied Ti 3d states in the band
gap and the corresponding localization of the excess electrons,
depends strongly on the exchange–correlation functional used
(cf. Table 1). Periodic spin-polarized GGA approaches failed
to reproduce the splitting of the occupied Ti 3d states from
Fig. 7. Electron density loss when defects at the (1 × 2) reduced TiO2(110)
surface (3L slab) are healed as obtained with PW91. The contour corresponds

the bottom of the conduction band. In contrast, HF, B3LYP,
HFLYP, and LDA (13% Fock admixture) calculations, which
make use of exact exchange, provided the expected localization
independent of the model (cluster or periodic) employed.
The use of different approximations to exchange and
correlation lead not only to considerable disagreements in the
calculated electronic structure but also to important quantitative
differences in the energy for the removal of lattice oxygen as
discussed next.
3.3.2. The rutile TiO2(110) surface defect formation energy
Among the hybrid DFT studies on the reduced TiO2(110)
surface, only in that by Bredow and Pacchioni [12] was the
energy to form an isolated oxygen defect discussed. They used
the oxygen atom as reference (i.e., EO
f in Eq. (1)). The defect
formation energy depends strongly on the cluster model used.
It was lower when the clusters were embedded in point charges
(4.79–4.90 eV, unrelaxed geometries) than for the case of H-
termination (from 6.75 to 7.27 eV, also unrelaxed). For the
larger Ti17O34 (H2O)19 cluster used EO
f is 7.27 eV. If referred
to 1
2O2 (Eq. (2), with E
1
2 O2
d
= 5.20 eV in B3LYP [12]), the
defect formation energy becomes E

f
= 4.67 eV. Lattice
relaxations will lower these values (cf. Table 3). A decrease of
1.95 eV as calculated for the smaller Ti10O20 (H2O)12 cluster
(obtained in a restricted open-shell calculation), leads to an
estimate of E

8.93 and 8.56 eV for the (1×3) and (1×2) unrelaxed structures,
respectively, using the PW91 functional. Lattice relaxations
reduce the defect formation energy (EO
f ) to 5.90 and 6.95 eV
for Θdef = 1/3 and 1/2, respectively. Naturally, including the
already described non-negligible relaxations in inner layers,
will further reduce the cost to create a defect as discussed later
in this section.
Using the value of 5.87 eV for the O2 dissociation energy
[14], calculated within the same computational setup as used in
Ref. [13], we obtain (cf. Eq. (2)) E

= 2.97 eV (Θdef = 1/3)
and 4.02 eV (Θdef = 1/2, Table 3). These numbers indicate that
the interaction between oxygen defects along the [001] rows is
markedly repulsive.
Vijay et al. [15] and Oviedo et al. [16] considered the
dependence of the defect formation energy on the slab thickness
(up to 7L) and defect concentration (as low as Θdef = 1/4).

Before discussing their results, we note here that Ramamoorthy
et al. [106] indicated in their earlier studies that when all
the atoms in the non-defective slab are allowed to relax, the
TiO2(110) surface energy converged slowly with slab thickness
(from three to six), and an oscillatory behavior was reported
for the ﬁrst time. Since then, a number of theoretical works
have dealt with this issue [10,15–18,150,160,161]. In the odd-
layer slabs there is an extra symmetry of reﬂection about the
plane of the central layer that constrains the relaxation of
these slabs in comparison with that of the even-layer slabs.
Moreover, in the latter, a bilayer substructuring occurs [150].
As a consequence of these differences, the surface energy
oscillates. However, average values between nL and (n + 1)L
slabs converge much faster. The reason for mentioning this is
that such oscillations reappear in the defect formation energies
obtained using periodic approaches.
Fig. 9 shows the results of Oviedo et al. [16] for the
defect formation energies of Θdef = 1/2 and two different
conﬁgurations (all atoms relaxed), and Table 3 summarizes
those of Vijay et al. [15] (bottom layer ﬁxed). Both groups
found that E
1
2 O2
f
oscillates with the number of layers in the slab.
This behavior has also been asserted by the PW91 calculations
of Rasmussen et al. [18] for Θdef = 1/4, 1/3, and 1/2, and
3L–6L slabs, of which 2L were allowed to relax (Table 3). The
amplitude of the oscillations, however, is seen to decrease more
rapidly than previously reported (cf. Fig. 9). Indeed, it has been
recently shown [161] that ﬁxing some layers at the bottom of
the slab reduces the amplitude of the large oscillations in the
defect formation energy present in fully relaxed slabs.
These oscillations can cause a signiﬁcant discrepancy
between defect formation energies obtained for thin (e.g., three
layers as in Ref. [13]) or thick slabs. Similar to the surface
energy, average values converge much faster with the number
of slab layers. The results in Fig. 9 suggest that the average
value for 4L and 5L slabs (4.5L) yields the converged (average)
232

value within ∼0.1 eV. Note that the (1 × 2) arrangement was
found to be slightly preferred over the (2×1) (by about 0.1 eV)
in agreement with previous work [7] (cf. Section 3.3.1).
The detailed comparison between calculated defect forma-
tion energies by different authors (e.g., Refs. [13,15,16]), even
if obtained with the same computational technique (i.e., work-
ing with the same code, number of slab layers, and energy cut-
off), is not as straightforward as one may expect (cf. Table 3).
May be this explains why authors [15,16] do not always com-
pare their results with previously published work. For example,
using a 3L slab and a (1 × 2) cell, values of 4.02 eV [13], 3.54
eV [15], and ∼2.8 eV [16] were obtained, a difference within
1.2 eV. The origin of this discrepancy is probably in the subtle
computational details such as the vacuum thickness (approxi-
mately 6, 15, and 5 ˚
A in Refs. [13] [15], and [16], respectively)
and the number of layers in the slab allowed to relax, one (Ref.
[13]), two (Ref. [15]) or all (Ref. [16]). Additionally, the k-point
sampling was not exactly the same, but of similar quality. To
fully understand the fairly large discrepancies would require
a very laborious testing of the separate effects of a consider-
able number of technical parameters on the calculated energies.
Nevertheless, the differences between average values is expect-
edly less severe. For 3.5L (average of 3L and 4L) is about 0.4
eV (cf. ∼4.0 and ∼3.6 eV Ref. [15], and Fig. 9, respectively).
Oviedo et al. [16] estimated a value of ∼3 eV for the isolated
defect limit for the TiO2(110) surface with the PW91 functional
using the 4.5L value of 3.07 eV from spin-paired calculations
employing a (1 × 4) structure (Θdef = 1/4). As previously
mentioned, the actual 4L and 5L triplet states are expected to
be favored by only a few tenths of an electronvolt (or less)
compared to the corresponding closed-shell states.
Wu et al. [17] used 4L thick slabs representing defect
concentrations of 1/6, 1/4, and 1/2 with the PBE functional.
Thus, the computational method somewhat differs from that
of Refs. [13,15,16] (see additional details in Table 3). Two
different conﬁgurations at Θdef = 1/4 were considered using
(1 × 4) and (2 × 2) cells. The defect separation along the
(shorter) [001] direction is twice as large (4 · c) in the (1 × 4)
structure. The defect formation energy of 3.55 eV for the (1×4)
cell (Table 3) was only by 0.03 eV larger than that for a (2 × 3)
cell at Θdef = 1/6. Thus, the (1 × 4) structure appears to be
representative of an isolated defect. The value of ∼3.5 eV is,
however, by ∼0.5 eV larger than the estimated [16] ∼3 eV
using the PW91 functional (and the energies of 4L and 5L
calculations at Θdef = 1/4). The use of the different PW91 and
PBE functionals does not explain such a signiﬁcant difference
since they are constructed so as to yield essentially the same
results for structure, bond dissociation, and adsorption energies
[40,56,57].
We recall that the use of a small and even number of layers
such as 4L yields overestimated defect formation energies [15,
16,18]. For the example of Θdef = 1/2 (see Fig. 9), the values
calculated using a fully relaxed 4L slab are ∼0.4 eV larger
than the converged (average) values. As already mentioned,
the amplitude of the oscillations decreases more rapidly for
non-fully relaxed slabs. Hence, the overestimation using 4L
of which the bottom layer was held ﬁxed as in Ref. [17],
is expected not to exceed a few tenths of an electronvolt.
Such correction applied to the value of ∼3.5 eV (4L) for the
estimated isolated defect limit in Ref. [17], would bring it closer
to the corresponding value of ∼3 eV (4.5L) in Ref. [16].
There are other possible reasons for this dissimilarity
that relate to the computational methods. Calculated defect
formation energies strongly depend on the ability of the
methods to describe the O2 molecule (cf. Eq. (2)). Hence, at
this point, comparing the calculated O2 dissociation energy
(E
1
2 O2
d
) by different implementations of periodic calculations
using gradient-corrected functionals (PW91 and PBE) [13,
15–18] may be clarifying and instructive. The results in
the sixth column of Table 3 show differences up to 0.4
eV/atom. (Differences due to the use of hybrid functionals are
discussed later in this section.) We attribute the discrepancy
in the dissociation energy (in part) to differences in the
pseudopotentials and the cutoff. The O2 interatomic distance
was in all calculations quite well described. For instance, it
was 1.24 ˚
A (PBE: Ref. [17] and PW91: Ref. [15]) compared
to the experimental value of 1.21 ˚
A (Ref. [162]). The GGA O2
dissociation energy is overestimated [40,55,56]. The converged
PBE and PW91 values (3.12 and 3.10 eV/atom, respectively,
Ref. [56]) are very similar and about 0.5 eV larger than the
experimental value of 2.59 eV/atom (obtained after adding
the contributions due to zero point vibrations to the T = 0
K value) [162]. However, the calculated values (Table 3) of
3.32 (PBE: Ref. [17]), 2.94 (PW91: Refs. [13,15,16]), and 3.03
eV/atom (PW91: Ref. [18]) are by ∼0.2 larger and ∼0.2–0.1
eV smaller, respectively, than the corresponding converged
(GGA) values. These (fairly large) deviations are likely to
“reappear” in the calculated defect formation energies. They
are of course independent of those caused by approximations
such as different k-meshes, slab and vacuum thicknesses, extent
of lattice relaxations, etc., but indicative of differences in the
pseudopotentials and the cutoff. Hammer et al. [57] have shown
that molecular bond energies are particularly sensitive to the
details of the pseudopotential. In particular, the choice of the
oxygen core radii led to deviations of about 0.2 eV in E
1
2 O2
d
.
Hence, variations (by up to a few tenths of an electronvolt)
in the oxygen defect formation energies, as calculated using
supercells, pseudopotentials, and GGA functionals, resulting
(among other reasons) from the arbitrariness in the choice of
the pseudopotential, can be expected. This has to be kept in
mind when comparing the results in Refs. [13,15–18].
Rasmussen et al. [18] analyzed the dependence of the defect
formation energy on the number of layers in the slab (3L–6L),
and the number of them that are allowed to relax (1L–4L)
in great detail (Table 3). The relaxation of more than 2L led
to small differences in vacancy formation energies, e.g., at
Θdef = 1/2 for a 6L slab, values of 4.31, 4.29, and 4.25
eV with 2L, 3L, and 4L relaxed, respectively. (The value for
a 3L relaxation is not listed in Table 3.) However, for all
thicknesses, deviations were larger (up to ∼0.3 eV) if only
one layer was allowed to relax [18]. At Θdef = 1/2 and for
a 3L slab, values of 4.02 and 3.73 eV were obtained with 1L
and 2L relaxed, respectively (not listed in Table 3). The former
M.V. Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. / Surface Science Reports 62 (2007) 219–270
233
agrees well with the corresponding value of Menetrey et al. [13]
(cf. Table 3). From the energy dependence on slab thickness and
extent of lattice relaxations, we gather that the PW91 results of
Rasmussen et al. [18], obtained using 4L slabs (of which two
are relaxed), are converged within 0.1–0.2 eV.
As already mentioned, the defect formation energy depends
signiﬁcantly on the defect separation along the [001] rows.
The 4L values by Rasmussen et al. [18] for the primitive
cells of increasing size are in broad agreement with previously
reported trends [16,17]; the defect formation energy decreases
by approximately 1.0 eV when Θdef decreases from 1/2 to 1/4
(the distance between defects increases from 2 · c to 4 · c).
An additional 0.2–0.1 eV decrease in energy is obtained
if the distance between defects increases from 4 · c to 6 · c
(i.e., Θdef = 1/4, 1/6 in the primitive cells). The use of centered
cells at the same defect concentration (cf. p(1 × 6) and c(2 ×
6)) results in an additional decrease of 0.1 eV attributable to
defect–defect interactions along the [¯
110] direction (i.e., across
the rows). The value of 3.03 eV for the c(2 × 6) structure at
Θdef = 1/6 represents the isolated defect limit. It is consistent
with the previous PW91 estimate of ≈3 eV [16].
Regardless of the discussed variations in the defect
formation energies, the recent investigations [13,15–18] using
periodic approaches and gradient-corrected functionals (i.e., the
same computational level), can be considered of comparable
quality. We conclude that approximately 3 eV is needed to
create a single defect at the (rutile) TiO2(110) surface, when
using gradient-corrected functionals. As already mentioned, the
GGA (PW91 or PBE) functionals are known to systematically
overestimate bond energies of molecules, cohesive energy of
solids, and atomic and molecular bonding to surfaces [40,55–
57] and the estimated E
1
2 O2
f
≈3 eV is no exception.
The use of hybrid functionals such as B3LYP, which appears
to be essential for the proper description of the localization
of the excess electrons (Section 3.3.1), reduces the O2 GGA
overbinding by ∼0.5 eV/atom, from 3.12/3.10 eV/atom
(PBE/PW91) to 2.60 eV/atom (B3LYP). The deviation of
the calculated B3LYP O2 dissociation energy from experiment
[162] (2.59 eV/atom) is one order of magnitude smaller than
those of the GGA values. This indicates that accurate oxygen
defect formation energies can only be expected when hybrid
functionals such as B3LYP are used. However, they cannot as
yet be efﬁciently used with fairly large supercells. Therefore,
it is still very meaningful to perform hybrid calculations on
cluster models of TiO2 surfaces such as those employed in
Ref. [12]. Yet, the quality of the model should be checked
using either larger cluster sizes or supercell approaches, but the
same functional. This was not done in Ref. [12], but would
be desirable. Nevertheless, as discussed at the beginning of
this section, we estimated (by adding relaxation effects of
small clusters to values for unrelaxed larger clusters, Table 3)
a value of ∼2.7 eV for the isolated defect formation energy
at the B3LYP level, i.e., about 10% less than the (estimated)
converged PW91/PBE value. Properly including relaxation
effects in the cluster model (and increasing its size) may lead
to additional differences.
3.4. Reduced TiO2 anatase surfaces
As mentioned in Section 3.1, relative to rutile much less
is known about anatase surfaces than about rutile surfaces. In
correspondence to the rutile (110) surface, the reduced anatase
(101) surface obtained by removal of twofold coordinated
oxygen atoms (O(2) in Fig. 2) was theoretically investigated
[22], however, hybrid studies have not yet been reported.
Vittadini and Selloni [22] simulated a partially reduced (101)
surface using a 2L slab and a (1 × 3) unit cell with the
(spin-polarized) PW91 functional. One of the surface bridging
oxygen atoms was removed, i.e., Θdef = 1/6. The term layer
is used for the repeating O2–Ti4O4–O2 unit (Fig. 2). Atomic
relaxations were allowed with the six outermost TiO2 units
ﬁxed at their bulk positions. The calculated defect formation
energy was E
1
2 O2
f
= 4.7 eV.
Recently, Bouzoubaa et al. [14] also carried out spin-
polarized PW91 calculations but on the less stable [107] (001)
and (100) anatase surfaces that also possess twofold coordinate
oxygen atoms. Reduced surfaces were modelled using (2 × 2)
cells and 3L slabs of which 1L and 2L were allowed to relax
for the (001) and (100) slab, respectively. The energies of
formation of bridging oxygen defects at Θdef = 1/4 were 4.38
and 4.40 eV for the (001) and (100) surfaces, respectively. As
stressed in the previous section, defect formation energies are
sensitive to the details of the computational approach. Thus, a
direct comparison of these two numbers with that for the (101)
surface in Ref. [22] is not very meaningful. Nevertheless, the
difference between the energies in Table 4 (anatase surfaces)
and Table 3 (rutile surface) is sufﬁciently large to conclude
that oxygen removal from anatase surfaces is more difﬁcult
than from the (110) rutile one. This is in agreement with
the aforementioned experimentally observed little propensity
of anatase surfaces to form oxygen defects under reducing
conditions (see Section 3.2). Moreover, it also consistent with
an earlier theoretical prediction on the facile reduction of rutile
surfaces based on simple electrostatic arguments [163]. We will
comment further on this difference in Section 7.
The ground state of the reduced anatase surfaces was a
singlet (as before, we assume that authors did not search
for an open-shell singlet solution if they did not mention
this explicitly). Yet, the triplet is only slightly unfavored
(less than 0.01 eV); for the (100) surface it was in fact the
triplet favored by that amount (see Table 4). Given these tiny
energy differences the spin state of the ground state remains
uncertain. In addition, Vittadini and Selloni [22] found that
for the unrelaxed (101) reduced surface, the excess electrons
were mostly localized on the Ti atoms originally bonded to
the removed oxygen atom (cf. Fig. 10) and that actually the
triplet was slightly favored. When the structure was relaxed,
the singlet became the ground state with the excess electrons
spreading over all surface cations. This relaxation induced
distribution of the excess electrons is largely similar to the
results in Fig. 8 for the rutile TiO2(110) surface. We observe
that relaxations lead to additional delocalization of the excess
electrons when gradient-corrected functionals, whereas the use

3.5. Reduced rutile and anatase TiO2 bulk
While there have been many theoretical investigations of
oxygen defects at TiO2 surfaces, relatively few studies have
dealt with such defects in the bulk phases [7–9,14,26,27,29], of
which none employed hybrid approaches; Mackrodt et al. [8]
used spin-unrestricted Hartree–Fock, and the others used the
LDA or gradient-corrected functionals [7,9,14,26,27,29].
Consistently with the ﬁndings for the surface oxygen
defects, only the UHF calculated electronic structure of the
reduced TiO2 bulk shows defect related occupied states in the
gap (Table 5). The results of the periodic spin-polarized PW91
calculations of Lindan et al. [9] do not agree with those of
recent GGA studies [26,29], as they employed norm conserving
pseudopotentials [164] that may have had problems [18].
Mackrodt et al. [8] modelled an oxygen deﬁcient rutile
TiO2 bulk using a supercell of composition Ti8O16. In this
conﬁguration defects are surrounded by a single unit cell of
non-defective crystal only in two directions, whereas lines of
defects are formed in the c-direction. It is likely that atomic
relaxations upon defect formation were considered, however,
were not discussed.
Unlike in their surface studies (cf. Section 3.3.1), they
used Gaussian basis sets with and without oxygen functions
at the vacant site. Both sets led to an insulating, triplet spin-
polarized ground-state and the appearance of states in the band
gap located ∼1–2 eV above the top of the valence band.
This is similar to their surface result as obtained without
functions at the vacant site. The most signiﬁcant difference is,
however, that for the surface the UHF calculations predicted
an antiferromagnetic spin arrangement, i.e., an open-shell
singlet. The ground state of the reduced bulk as derived
from the calculation with basis functions at the vacancy was
lower in energy by 1.4 eV. In the latter, most of the excess-
electron density was localized at the vacancy site with the
rest asymmetrically distributed between the nearest and next-
nearest Ti atoms. The net spin-population was 0.8 (vacant site),
1.0, and 0.2, respectively. The occupied states formed two
well separated features in the gap. In the absence of vacancy
functions, the excess electrons were mostly localized at the
cation sites, whereas the rest was distributed among three
O atoms. The spin-populations at both Ti (nearest and next-
nearest) sites were ∼1.0.
Whereas in the earlier LDA investigation of Ramamoorthy
et al. [7] spin polarization was not considered, in the recent
LDA and GGA studies the ground state was triplet for the (2 ×
2×2) and singlet for the bigger (2×2×3) and (3×3×5) cells
(Table 5) [14,26,29]. As before, we assume that the authors
did not search for an open-shell singlet solution unless it is
explicitly stated otherwise. In all cases, the energy difference
between the ground state (closed-shell singlet or triplet) and
the less favored magnetic state was found not to exceed 0.05
eV. Such small energy difference does not allow for a deﬁnite
statement on the magnetic ground state of the reduced rutile
phase at low defect concentrations. These four investigations
considered geometry relaxation upon reduction. However, in
Ref. [14] only the positions of the three metal atoms close to the
oxygen defect were allowed to relax. The outward displacement
of the neighboring Ti atoms to the defect was reported, namely,
by ∼0.1 (Ref. [7]) and ∼0.3 ˚
A (Ref. [26]). Furthermore,
a metallic ground state was found with local and gradient-
corrected functionals [7,26,29]. In reality, when atoms of the
(3 × 3 × 5) cell were ﬁxed at their bulk position, a defect state
in the gap was obtained with LDA [26]. This relaxation induced
delocalization of the excess electrons in reduced TiO2 systems
had been previously observed in GGA studies of reduced TiO2
surfaces [18,22] (Sections 3.4 and 3.3.1).
Bouzoubaa et al. [14] reported a PW91 defect formation
energy of 4.52 eV using a (2 × 2 × 2) cell, whereas we
obtained 4.43 eV using a (2 × 2 × 3) cell (Table 5) [29].
The latter agrees well with the previously reported PBE value
(4.40 eV) at the same defect concentration [27]. As already
mentioned, to quantitatively discuss the dependence of E
1
2 O2
f
on
the defect concentration, besides the varying cell sizes, the used
methodology has to be identical (i.e., same pseudopotentials
and cutoff, equivalent k-point meshes, etc.). The comparison
between our calculated E
1
2 O2
f
values for the (2 × 2 × 3)
and (3 × 3 × 5) cells indicates that the interaction between
oxygen defects is repulsive. However, bigger supercells have
to considered to get the value for the isolated defect limit. The
values of 4.1–4.4 eV/atom for rutile lies in the range of 3.9–5.7
eV/atom, obtained in thermogravimetric studies of defective
rutile TiOx with x = 0.0015–0.024 [165]. The use of GGA
functionals such as PW91 can explain an overestimation of up
to ∼1 eV of bond energies of 3d TM compounds [166].

Bouzoubaa et al. [14], Di Valentin et al. [27], and Hofmann
et al. [29] also performed calculations to investigate oxygen
defects in anatase with supercells of composition Ti32O64. The
latter considered a smaller cell (Ti16O32) as well. Similar to
the rutile phase, the interaction between defects is repulsive
(Table 5). The ground state is a (spin-paired) singlet; the
energy difference between the singlet and triplet states is small
(∼0.1 eV). As already mentioned, the more facile formation
of defects at rutile than at anatase surfaces has been observed.
The comparison of the E

values obtained for the rutile and
anatase bulk phases using the (3×3×5) and (2

cells, respectively, indicates that a similar behavior for defects
in the bulk may be expected (cf. 4.05 (rutile) with 4.27 eV
(anatase) in Table 5).
3.6. Summary TiO2
Much has been learned about the changes in the geometry
and electronic structure upon defect formation in the rutile TiO2
crystal and at its (110) oriented surface in recent years. The
knowledge about anatase systems is less deep.
The relaxation patterns are complex, for the rutile TiO2(110)
surface in particular, with atomic displacements of up to ∼0.3
˚
A perpendicular to the surface as found with gradient-corrected
functionals. Sizeable relaxations extend up to the two outermost
slab layers. They lead to a considerable surface buckling
and a “wider” defect site. The optimal geometry with hybrid
approaches has not been discussed in detail yet, but it is likely
to somewhat differ from the GGA one.
Spin-polarized DFT (periodic) within the LDA or GGA
approximations fails to correctly describe the experimentally
observed localized nature of the excess electrons in reduced
TiO2 systems, resulting in metallic ground states. This is
valid for both, all-electron and (ultra-soft) pseudopotentials
approaches. For the rutile TiO2(110) surface in particular, the
localization of the excess electrons have been corroborated by
theoretical studies at the HF level (periodic) and employing
(periodic and clusters) hybrid approaches, namely, HFLYP,
B3LYP, and one that combines an empirically ﬁtted percentage
of exact exchange with LDA (13% Fock). Both B3LYP
and the hybrid LDA + 13% Fock give the position of the
occupied Ti 3d states upon reduction below the bottom of
the conduction band (0.6–1.1 eV) close to experiment. The
answer onto which Ti ions the two excess electrons localize
for a single defect (surrounded by at least a neighboring
shell of non-defective material), depends on the model with
B3LYP. Either on the two next-nearest neighbors (Ti(5)) to the
defect (partially reoptimized cluster) or one electron localizes
on a nearest (Ti(6) in the clean surface) and the other on
a next-nearest neighbor (fully optimized c(2 × 4) slab). In
addition, when considering clusters and the B3LYP functional
the excess electrons localized only if atomic displacements
were considered, whereas relaxation in defective supercells
(bulk and surfaces) with GGA functionals led to an increase
in the extent of the delocalization of the excess electrons. These
results show the importance of both exact exchange and lattice
relaxations for the proper description of the electronic structure.
It would be desirable to perform a GGA calculation using the
optimized B3LYP geometry and viceversa as recently done for
the hydroxylated TiO2(110) surface [27].
For the reduced bulk phases, the energy difference between
the triplet and closed-shell singlet is less than 0.05 eV (PW91),
i.e., the two spin states have virtually the same energy. The
defective anatase surfaces show a similar behavior, with singlet
[(001), (101)] and triplet [(100)] ground states. For the (relaxed)
defective rutile TiO2(110) supercells, the closed-shell singlet is
0.05–0.1 eV above the triplet (PW91/PBE), whereas it is 0.4
eV in the absence of relaxation of a cluster model with B3LYP.
Hybrid LDA+13% Fock predicts an energy difference between
the triplet and open-shell singlet states which is no more than a
few millielectronvolts for a (relaxed) defective slab (Θdef = 1).
The cost to create a defect depends on the model and on
the approximations to exchange and correlation. Using slabs
and gradient-corrected functionals, independently of the defect
concentration, the average defect formation energy oscillates on
the rutile TiO2(110) surface with the number of slab layers. A
minimum of 4L of which (not less than) 2L are relaxed appears
to give results converged within ∼0.1–0.2 eV.
The TiO2(110) surface defect interactions are repulsive and
fairly strong along the [001] direction. A centered (2×6) cell is
representative of the isolated defect limit. Its formation energy
is estimated to be ≈3.0 eV (PW91 functional). Using cluster
models (that included relaxations in a limited way) and the
B3LYP functional, a value of ≈2.7 eV has been estimated.
This number may decrease when larger and relaxed clusters are
considered. The database of the energies for creating defects at
the rutile TiO2(110) surface is very large. However, no study of
the defect formation energy, aiming beyond gradient-corrected
functionals with proper account for geometry relaxation, have
been carried out for reduced TiO2 yet.
The few defect formation energy values available for anatase
systems are larger than those for rutile and are consistent
with the experimentally observed lower tendency of anatase to
release atomic oxygen under reducing conditions.
4. Zirconium oxide
4.1. ZrO2 applications and basic information
Zirconia-based ceramics are used in a variety of technolog-
ical and commercial applications, ranging from thermal barrier
coatings on aircraft turbines to affordable diamond substitutes
[167,168]. Recently, zirconia has received attention as an alter-
native dielectrics to silicon dioxide for memory and logic de-
vices [169]. The versatility of zirconia originates entirely from
atomic or point defects in the crystal created by adding alio-
valent oxides, e.g., MgO, La2O3, and Y2O3. The substitutional
cations or dopants that are charge balanced by the formation of
oxygen vacancies, and their mutual interactions, dramatically
affect the structural, thermal, mechanical, and electrical prop-
erties of modiﬁed or stabilized zirconia (SZ). These defects are
solely responsible for the high ionic conductivity of doped zir-
conia that underlies its use in oxygen sensors [170], and high-
temperature fuel cells [171]. Zirconia is also used as a support
material in heterogeneous catalysis [172].

Fig. 11. Bulk structure of the three cubic, tetragonal, and monoclinic ZrO2 polymorphs. Small and large circles represent the oxygen and zirconium atoms,
respectively. (a) c-ZrO2, (b) t-ZrO2, and (c) m-ZrO2.
Pure ZrO2 adopts the monoclinic baddelyte structure (m-
ZrO2) under ambient conditions [173,174], with Zr in a
distorted sevenfold coordination and O atoms are either
fourfold or threefold coordinated (see Fig. 11). Above ∼1400
K, it transforms to a tetragonally distorted ﬂuorite structure (t-
ZrO2) [175], with Zr surrounded by eight anions, but with two
slightly different Zr–O distances. Perfect eightfold coordination
is achieved at ∼2600 K with a transformation to the cubic
ﬂuorite structured phase (c-ZrO2) [176]. However, the presence
of dopants stabilizes the tetragonal and cubic modiﬁcations,
even at room temperature. Oxygen atoms in the tetragonal and
cubic phases are fourfold coordinated.
The three phases are insulators. The reported experimental
band gap values for the monoclinic phase are 4.2 eV (Ref.
[177] obtained by EELS), and 5.8–7.1 eV (Ref. [178] obtained
by vacuum–ultraviolet spectroscopy). The VUV reﬂectance
method tends to overestimate the value of band gaps. The
amount by which the band gap of the c-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2
phases differs from that of the m-ZrO2 phase is not resolved
experimentally. Values (VUV) of 6.1–7.1 (c-ZrO2) and 5.8–6.6
eV (t-ZrO2) were reported [178].
From experimental studies on polycrystalline samples of t-
ZrO2 it is known that only a few low-index crystal planes
are preferentially exposed, with the (101) face being the most
favored [179]. Theoretical investigations on the stability of
different surface orientations support this observation. The
(101) oxygen terminated surface is by far the most stable (see
Fig. 12) followed by the (001) face, also oxygen terminated
[35,180–182]. (Note that the orientation of the surfaces is
named differently in Ref. [180].) The oxygen atoms at these
surfaces are threefold coordinated (cf. fourfold in bulk). The
t-ZrO2(101) surface exhibits two different types of oxygen
atoms.
4.2. Experimental ﬁndings on oxygen vacancies
As titania, stabilized zirconia becomes colored when
exposed at high temperature to a reducing atmosphere, and a
pronounced room-temperature electron spin or paramagnetic
resonance (ESR/EPR) signal appears [183], suggesting the
existence of trapped electrons. A great deal of experimental
work has been dedicated to the study and characterization
of defects in SZ using electron paramagnetic resonance,
optical absorption, and photoemission techniques [184–188].
Although in ZrO2 oxygen vacancies are commonly introduced
deliberately by adding stabilizing low-valence metal ions,
undoped ZrO2 may contain a signiﬁcant concentration of
oxygen vacancies [189,190]. Experimental investigations of
the electronic structure of polycrystalline pure ZrO2 and
its changes upon reduction by Ar bombardment using
photoemission spectroscopy have identiﬁed signiﬁcant changes
in the O 2p band and the appearance of occupied electronic
states in the band gap at 2.3 eV above the top of the valence
band [191,192]. These states have been assigned to electrons
populating Zr 4d orbitals of adjacent cations to the oxygen
defects.
4.3. Reduced ZrO2 bulk phases
Point defects in modiﬁed or stabilized zirconia systems have
been extremely topical in theoretical studies (see e.g., Refs. [30,
182,193–202]), which focus on ion mobility [30,199–201],
thermal properties [197,198], and the interactions between the
dopant cations and oxygen vacancies [194–196].
State-of-the-art computational methods have been also used
to model reduced undoped zirconia systems [29–35], bulk
phases in particular. Relative to the bulk, there are fewer
investigations of reduced zirconia surfaces [29,33–35]. Oxygen
induced lattice relaxation, the question whether the electrons
left in the system occupy the vacant site or localize at
neighboring cations, and the energy of oxygen removal have
been addressed. Different exchange–correlation functionals
have been applied, including the LDA and PW91, as well as
B3LYP. The use of the hybrid approach was limited to just the
defect formation energy of t-ZrO2 systems.

atoms, respectively. Only the three outermost slab layers are completely shown. The dotted lines indicate the repeating unit (one-layer) in the direction perpendicular
to the surface.
4.3.1. Structure relaxation and electronic structure
Foster et al. [31,32] considered the monoclinic zirconia
phase. They performed spin-polarized PW91 calculations and
investigated an (isolated) oxygen defect in a (2 × 2 × 2) cell
(Zr32O64, 96 atoms) allowing for ∼10 ˚
A separation between the
periodic images of the defect. The cell parameters were taken
from calculations for the defect free material that deviated by
less than 1% from the experimental values (aexp = 5.15 ˚
A,
bexp/aexp = 1.01, cexp/aexp = 1.03, β = 99.23◦) [203]. The
positions of all atoms in the unit cell were allowed to relax.
Removal of both fourfold and threefold coordinated oxygen
atoms, denoted as O(4) and O(3), respectively, was considered.
In both cases, formation of a neutral oxygen defect led to small
relaxations of the neighboring Zr atoms with displacements
of about 0.01–0.02 ˚
A from the perfect crystal positions. The
corresponding relaxation energy was 0.11 eV.
The neutral O(3) and O(4) vacancies have a doubly occupied
one-electron level in the gap. In the following, as before, we
understand that authors did not look for an open-shell singlet
solution unless they clearly stated it. The main properties of
both types of defects are very similar and the details below are
given in terms of the O(4) defect. The defect charge density is
strongly localized with a maximum at the center of the vacancy
and can be described as a bonding combination of atomic
orbitals of all four Zr atoms neighboring the vacant site. The
defect state is ∼2.2 eV above the top of the valence band in the
gap. The difference in total energy of the defective supercell
(for the ﬁxed geometry of the relaxed singlet) and the triplet
state is ∼1.2 eV above the (closed-shell) singlet. We recall that
for the reduced TiO2 bulk phases, energy differences between
these two spin states are by about two orders of magnitude
smaller (few tenths of a millielectronvolt, see Section 3.5).
Foster et al. [31] also considered a singly and doubly
positively charged vacancy. Lattice relaxation effects were
larger than for the neutral defect. For instance, for the singly
charged defect, the four Zr neighbors moved away from the
vacancy by about 0.1 ˚
A and the relaxation energy was 0.47 eV.
The spin density map of the positively charged O(4) oxygen
defect, O(4)+, is displayed in Fig. 13. It clearly shows that the
remaining electron is (also) strongly localized at the defect site
and demonstrates contributions of Zr d-orbitals.
The strong localization of the electron density at the defect
site and the behavior of the lattice relaxation are qualitatively
similar to those for neutral and charged oxygen vacancies in
MgO [65,67,69]. This type of defects in MgO are known as F,
F+, and F2+ color centers, depending on their charge [204].
Therefore, differently charged oxygen defects in zirconia are
loosely attributed in the literature to the class of F centers.
As anticipated, the band gap of monoclinic ZrO2 was
signiﬁcantly underestimated in agreement with previous GGA
studies [205] (cf. 3.4 eV with the experimental values in the
4.2–7.1 eV range, Section 4.1). The same obviously applies to
the cubic and tetragonal phases with GGA calculated band gaps
of 3.1 (c-ZrO2, Ref. [205]) and 3.9 and 4.2 eV (t-ZrO2, Refs.
[30,205]). (The corresponding experimental values are 6.1–7.1
(c-ZrO2) and 5.8–6.6 eV (t-ZrO2), Section 4.1.) We note in
passing that the use of the LDA together with the so-called GW
approximation for the electron self-energy [206,207], improves
the agreement between theory and experiment considerably. In
this approximation, the self-energy is the product of the single-
particle Green function G and the screened Coulomb interaction
W. The GW values are 5.42 (m-ZrO2), 5.55 c-ZrO2, and 6.40
eV (t-ZrO2) [33]. The position of the defect state ∼2.2 eV
above the top of the valence band in m-ZrO2 [31], is likely to
move if methods which do give more accurate band gaps are
used [208].
Kr´
alik et al. [33] considered cubic zirconia using the LDA
together with the GW approximation. The calculated LDA
structural parameters compared well (within ∼1%) to the
experimental value (aexp = 5.09 ˚
A) [203]. The study of oxygen
defects in cubic zirconia employed a (2 × 2 × 1) supercell
consisting of four formula units. The internal coordinates of all
atoms were allowed to relax with LDA. As for the monoclinic
phase, the defect induced displacements of the neighboring

Zr atoms were small (∼0.02 ˚
A). A fully occupied state, well
separated from both the valence and conduction bands, was
found in the band gap 2.1 eV below the conduction band
edge with the GW approximation. The defect state is formed
by a linear combination of Zr d-orbitals. Fig. 14 shows the
square of the wave function associated to the defect state.
This plot reveals that indeed Zr dz2 orbitals give the dominant
contribution to the state and that it is mostly localized at the
vacant site.
Oxygen vacancies in tetragonal ZrO2 were considered by
several authors [29,30,34]. Eichler [30] and Hofmann et al.
[29] performed spin-polarized PW91 calculations on periodic
models [156,157]. Calculated structural parameters agreed
within 1% with experiment (aexp = 3.64 ˚
A, cexp/aexp = 1.45)
[175].
For the investigation of O defects in t-ZrO2, Eichler [30]
used a (3 × 3 × 2) supercell (Zr36O72), whereas Hofmann
et al. [29] used (2 × 2 × 2) and (3 × 3 × 3) cells with
composition Zr16O32 and Zr54O108, respectively. As for the
monoclinic and cubic phases, (neutral) defect induced lattice
relaxations are small (up to 0.08 and 0.13 ˚
A for Zr and O
ions, respectively) with an energy gain of 0.22 eV, as reported
by Eichler [30]. Hofmann’s calculations yielded very similar
atomic displacements from the ideal bulk positions and a
relaxation energy of 0.17 and 0.51 eV for the (2 × 2 × 2) and
(3 × 3 × 3) supercell, respectively [29].
According to both calculations, the ground state of the
reduced systems is a singlet and a doubly occupied state shows
up in the band gap (see e.g., Fig. 15). The energy difference
between the closed-shell singlet and the triplet states (for
relaxed geometries) are 0.94 and 0.85 eV for the defective
Zr16O32 and Zr54O108 cell, respectively. This is similar to the
aforementioned result for monoclinic phase (1.2 eV).
The spin projected total density of states (DOS) of Hofmann
et al. [29] for the pure and reduced t-ZrO2 in both spin states
are compared in Fig. 15. In the singlet state, the peak at 2.8 eV
(∼2.5 eV in Ref. [30]) above the valence band results from the
partial occupation of Zr 4d orbitals (see Fig. 15(b)). Its position
relative to the valence band edge is in fairly good agreement
with that observed in reduced polycrystalline surfaces (2.3 eV)
[192]. The charge density isosurface associated to the vacancy
state is visualized in real space in Fig. 16. The two electrons
are trapped in the vacancy. In contrast, in the triplet state, the
excess electrons delocalize by partially “leaving” the vacant site
to occupy conduction band states, which are primarily localized
on the neighboring Zr atoms to the defect (cf. Fig. 15).
Safonov et al. [34] performed embedded cluster calculations
of an oxygen defect in t-ZrO2 using Hartree–Fock and the
B3LYP exchange–correlation functional. The Zr4O23 cluster
involved one central atom (that was removed to form the
bulk defect) and its ﬁrst and second coordination spheres. The
cluster was embedded in a ﬁeld of point charges located at
the zirconia lattice positions. The coordinates of all cluster
atoms were allowed to relax (at the Hartree–Fock level). The
oxygen basis set was retained at the defect site (see Table 6).
The Zr–O distances in the optimized cluster were 2.09 and
2.44 ˚
A, in agreement with the experimental values of 2.09 and
2.42 ˚
A, respectively. The vacancy induced lattice relaxations
were below 0.03 and up to 0.22 ˚
A for Zr and O ions,
respectively, values similar to those obtained in the periodic
PW91 calculations [29,30]. Safonov et al. [34] did not explicitly
state whether the ground state of the defective bulk is a singlet
or a triplet and whether the two electrons remained at the defect
site.
From the periodic calculations on reduced bulk ZrO2
discussed so far, we gather that gradient-corrected functionals
are indeed able to describe the localization of the excess
electrons and the appearance of a doubly occupied state in the
gap qualitatively (see Table 6). This is in contrast to reduced
TiO2 systems for which the use of exact exchange happened

to be essential to avoid a metallic ground state using GGA
functionals.
The relevant questions are why the excess electrons are
trapped at the vacant site, and why GGA functionals yield a
proper (qualitative) description of the defect’s nature. The ﬁrst
question can be understood qualitatively. In ZrO2, similarly
to MgO [70,209], the excess electrons experience a fairly
attractive Madelung potential favoring their stabilization at
the vacant site, and the ground state is a (closed-shell)
singlet. For instance, the Madelung potential at the O(4)
site (cf. Fig. 11) in bulk t-ZrO2, obtained from the Ewald
summation assuming GGA (PW91) self-consistently calculated
charges, equals −12.4 V [29]. We note that for the titania phases
we have calculated values which are by approximately 4 V
less attractive, whereas for MgO is −20.1 V (see Section 7
for further discussion and comparisons). As to the second
question, in ZrO2, the effect of the gross overestimation of
electron delocalization and metallic character of gradient-
corrected functionals is not too prominent because of its fairly
wide band gap.
4.3.2. The ZrO2 bulk defect formation energy
Foster et al. [31,32] calculated the defect formation energy
of both fourfold and threefold coordinated oxygen atoms from
the monoclinic phase. The EO
f (cf. Eq. (1)) values were 8.88
(O(4)) and 8.90 (O(3)), respectively (PW91). These numbers
refer to the singlet state. Using their calculated dissociation
energy of the O2 molecule value of 5.88 eV, they obtained 5.94
and 5.96 eV for E
1
2 O2
f
(cf. Eq. (2)), respectively (cf. Table 6).
The calculated PW91 E
1
2 O2
f
values for the tetragonal bulk
phase were 5.92 eV [29], 5.73 eV [30], and 5.41 eV [29] for
the (2 × 2 × 2), (3 × 3 × 2) and (3 × 3 × 3) cell, respectively.
The 0.51 eV decrease in the defect formation energy with the
increase in the unit cell size from the (2 × 2 × 2) to (3 × 3 × 3)
indicates repulsive interactions between closest defects. No
systematic periodic study aiming at the isolated defect limit in
ZrO2 systems has been carried out yet.
According to the embedded cluster B3LYP calculations in
Ref. [34], the vacancy formation energy in the t-ZrO2 phase
is E
1
2 O2
f
= 6.1 eV (EO
f
= 8.8 eV). Safonov et al. [34]
argued that the ∼0.4 eV deviation from the value previously
obtained by Eichler using periodic models and the PW91
functional (5.73 eV) [30], was an indication of the good
quality of the cluster model and other details of the calculation
(e.g., basis set). Because different functionals were used,
this conclusion is a priori not justiﬁed. In addition, oxygen
defect formation energies are almost certainly going to be
overestimated with PW91 for models of similar quality, which
the above comparison does not show.

4.4. Reduced t-ZrO2 surfaces
As mentioned above, relative to the reduced bulk ZrO2
phases much less is known about their surfaces. In fact, only
defective t-ZrO2(101) and (001) surfaces were investigated.
These correspond to the most and second most stable
orientations (cf. Section 4.1).
Hofmann et al. [35] carried out periodic spin-polarized
PW91 calculations on the reduced (relaxed) t-ZrO2(101) (1×1)
surface at Θdef = 1/2 (O(3)a defect) using a 5L slab (see
Fig. 12). The electronic structure resembles that of the bulk
system with the occupied state in the gap at 2.7 eV above the
valence band and the excess electrons localized at the defect
site (cf. Fig. 16).
Recently,
Hofmann
et
al.
[29]
considered
a
lower
concentration of O(3)a defects, namely Θdef = 1/16. The
vacancy induced displacements were small (up to 0.2 ˚
A) with
the adjacent Zr atoms moving away from the defect site. After
reduction a doubly occupied state appeared in the gap at 2.9
eV above the valence band. The (closed-shell) singlet state
is favored by about 0.08 eV, i.e., approximately two orders
of magnitude less than for the bulk (cf. Section 4.3.2). The
calculated surface O(3)a defect formation energy (E
1
2 O2
f
) for
Θdef = 1/16 is 5.48 eV.
Similar to the bulk results in Section 4.3.1, admixture of
exact exchange to the exchange–correlation functional is not
required to achieve the localization of the excess electrons and
to obtain a doubly occupied state in the gap of the reduced t-
ZrO2(101) surface.
Safonov et al. [34] investigated the formation of isolated
oxygen defects at the t-ZrO2(101) and (001) surfaces using
cluster models (Zr35O61 and Zr25O50, respectively) embedded
in a set of point charges. The spin-polarized calculations
were performed using the HF approach and the B3LYP
functional (other details in Table 6). Lattice relaxations upon
defect formation were considered and somewhat smaller
displacements for the stable (101) surface (0.1–0.2 ˚
A) than
for the (001) orientation (0.2 ˚
A) were reported. For the (101)
surface the singlet state was preferred by 0.1 eV in agreement
with the periodic PW91 calculations (cf. Table 6) [29,35],
whereas for the (001) surface the triplet and singlet states
differed by 0.01 eV. The B3LYP defect formation energies were
5.7 and 6.4 eV for (101) and (001), respectively. The former
is close to the value obtained with periodic PW91 calculations
(5.48 eV) [29]. As already discussed, this “agreement” does not
necessarily validate the cluster models used; comparisons have
to be made using the same exchange–correlation functional.
Note that according to the B3LYP cluster calculations, the
surface defect is more favorable than the bulk defect by ∼0.4 eV
for the (101) surface and less favorable for the (001) surface by
a similar amount (cf. Table 6). With respect to the PW91 t-ZrO2
bulk value of 5.41 eV (3 × 3 × 3), the (101) surface defects
(
Θdef = 1/16) have also a comparable stability. A systematic
study aiming at both isolated surface and bulk limits would be
desirable.
4.5. Summary ZrO2
Less is known about oxygen defects in pure zirconia,
surfaces in particular, than about defects in titania. One reason
is that mostly doped or stabilized zirconia is used in industrial
applications.
Both periodic (PW91) and cluster (B3LYP) approaches
predict small and rather localized lattice relaxations on
formation of neutral oxygen defects in ZrO2 systems with
atomic displacements of up to 0.1–0.2 ˚
A. The excess electron
density is localized at the vacant site and a partial reduction of
the neighboring Zr sites is observed. The electrons populate a
state in the band gap formed mainly by a linear combination
of Zr 4d orbitals. For most zirconia systems, the (closed-shell)
singlet state is more stable than the triplet state by up to a few
tenths of an electronvolt, independent of the model (periodic or
cluster) and the method (PW91 or B3LYP). The little relaxation
and the trapped electrons resemble the F-centers in ionic oxides
such as MgO, for which the inclusion of exact exchange is not
essential for their proper description. The existence of occupied
states in the wide-gap of ZrO2 is reproduced with local and
gradient-corrected functionals.
The PW91 functional predicts defect formation energies
values in the 5.4–5.9 eV range for O(4) defects in the t-ZrO2
and m-ZrO2 bulk phases, with the largest values corresponding
to m-ZrO2. The t-ZrO2(101) surface defect has similar stability
in comparison to the bulk. Existing (cluster) B3LYP results
for ZrO2 systems are not conclusive due to the presumed
inadequacy of the model, and the question of the energy
to form the oxygen defects with hybrid functionals remains
unanswered.
TiO2 and ZrO2 clearly represent two different cases of TM
oxides with respect to the nature of the oxygen defects.
5. Vanadium oxide
5.1. Applications and basic information
Vanadium oxides are used in many technological applica-
tions such as in electrical and optical switching devices, light
detectors, critical temperature sensors, and heterogeneous catal-
ysis [2,210]. All solid oxide catalysts used at an industrial scale
for production of organic anhydrides and acids contain vana-
dium as the main active component [211]. Since in oxides vana-
dium can have four different oxidation states, namely II, III, IV,
and V, a wide range of stable bulk vanadia phases exists. The
fundamental basis for the catalytic performance of vanadium
oxides lies in the variability of their geometric and electronic
structures.
The maximal valency oxide is V2O5. It exhibits an optical
band gap of ∼2.3 eV and is orange [212,213]. Bulk V2O5
has a layered structure and orthorhombic symmetry [214]
(aexp
=
11.51, bexp
=
3.56, cexp
=
4.37 ˚
A). There
are three structurally different oxygen atoms in each layer,
vanadyl oxygen (O(1)), coordinated to one vanadium atom,
bridging oxygen atoms (O(2)), and two inequivalent threefold
coordinated oxygen atoms (O(3) and O(3
′)), see Fig. 17. The
244
M.V. Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. / Surface Science Reports 62 (2007) 219–270
layers are bound by weak van der Waals type interactions, thus
forming a solid material which can be easily cleaved along
the (001) plane without rupture of any covalent bond. Hence,
the coordination of neither the oxygen nor vanadium atoms
(distorted octahedron) changes upon formation of the (001)
surface, which is the most stable. It is terminated by vanadyl
groups which form up and down oriented double rows parallel
to the [010] direction (Fig. 17).
Vanadia catalysts are usually synthesized as V2O5, but are
reduced to lower oxides under reaction conditions. The catalytic
behavior of vanadia in several oxidation reactions has been
discussed based on the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism
[215], which decouples the oxidation of the adsorptive from the
reoxidation of the catalyst. Lattice oxygen is considered as a
reactive intermediate [216,217]. Thus, the energy needed for
creating lattice oxygen defects at V2O5 surfaces is of particular
relevance, and reducibility is an important factor allowing this
oxide to function as a catalyst in selective oxidation.
The interest in the lower oxides, namely VO2, V2O3 and
VO, is much centered around phase transitions and magnetism,
and less around their reducibility. In particular the focus is on
metal–insulator transitions as a function of temperature, which
display peculiar structural, electronic and magnetic behavior
that remain yet to be understood [210]. Thus, in the following
we will restrict the discussion to the formation of oxygen
defects in V2O5.
5.2. Experimental ﬁndings on oxygen vacancies
The vanadium–oxygen phase diagram is, like in the
titanium–oxygen case, very rich and Magn´
eli phases also occur.
Known superstructures of V2O5 resulting from oxygen loss are
V3O7, V4O9, and V6O13 [218].
There have been several photoemission studies of the
clean and reduced V2O5(001) surfaces [219–221]. V2O5(001)
is easily reduced by low-energy particle bombardment and
thermal annealing, and it is very sensitive to all probing beams
(see also Refs. [222–227]). It has been frequently claimed
that the surface vanadyl oxygen atoms are the oxygen atoms
easiest to remove. However, Tepper et al. [220] suggested that
the surface oxygen defects formed after exposure to atomic
hydrogen are likely to be the bridging oxygen atoms (O(2)).
In the earlier studies by Zhang and Henrich [219], the
electronic structure of the UHV-cleaved V2O5(001) surface was
found to be similar to that of the bulk, namely, the UPS spectra
showed that the V 3d band was unoccupied (3d0 conﬁguration)
and the bottom of the O 2p valence band at about 2.5 eV below
the Fermi level (consistent with the existence of an optical bulk
band gap of ∼2.3 eV). When the clean surface was bombarded
by low-energy electrons, oxygen defects were created, leading
to reduced cations on the surface. UPS spectra of such reduced
surfaces exhibited an occupied peak ∼1 eV below the Fermi
energy (in the bulk band gap) due to partial population of the 3d
orbitals on reduced vanadium ions. According to accompanying
XPS measurements, VIV centers were primarily present at the
reduced surface [219]. We note here (and discuss in the next
section) that under the assumption that surface vanadyl oxygen

atoms were removed, the presence of VIV species indicates that
the two electrons left in the system upon O(1) removal did not
remain together at the V atom to which the remove oxygen
was initially bonded. Further oxygen loss could be induced
by Ar+ ion bombardment, as was indicated by the increased
intensity from the defect induced peak in the gap which was
accompanied by a shift of the V 2p levels towards lower binding
energies. This shift suggests the presence of V species with
oxidation states lower than IV.
Recent XPS and UPS experiments on thin V2O5 ﬁlms
have shown the presence of oxygen defects after annealing
in UHV [221]. At ∼300 ◦C a prevailing VIV valence state
was observed. With increasing temperature VIII species were
gradually created. The corresponding valence band spectra
were similar to those of reduced surfaces by bombardment,
i.e., a feature appeared in the bulk band gap at ∼1.3 eV below
the Fermi energy.
The experimental characterization of the reduced V2O5(001)
surface structure has been possible with modern surface science
techniques such as STM. Images of the V2O5(001) surface
cleaved in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and at room temperature
were recorded and inhomogeneities in the surface observed
[227,228]. The vanadyl O is easily removed from the surface
as a result of the cleavage and vacancies are left behind in
a non-random distribution. Blum et al. [227] have recently
observed thermally induced surface reconstructions of the
V2O5(001) surface; using in situ band gap mapping derived
from scanning tunneling spectroscopy data, they have observed
a metal–insulator transition at 350–400 K, which occurs

245
inhomegeneously across the surface and expands preferentially
in the direction of the vanadyl rows.
5.3. Reduced V2O5(001) surface
Theoretical studies on oxygen deﬁcient V2O5 systems have
been entirely devoted to the V2O5(001) surface [36–38,40–42].
One calculation was performed using both the hybrid B3LYP
and the PBE functionals and cluster models [40], whereas most
of the rest of the studies employed either cluster or periodic
models with gradient-corrected functionals [37,38,41,42].
5.3.1. Structure relaxation and electronic structure
Lambrecht et al. [36] performed the ﬁrst theoretical study
of the electronic structure of surface vanadyl oxygen vacancies
using a periodic single-layer tight-binding model of the surface
with frozen geometry and argued that relaxations which
introduce new types of interlayer coupling are not to be
expected. They considered one defect in the (1 × 1) unit cell
(Θdef = 1/2). This structure has alternate rows along the [010]
direction with and without vanadyl oxygen atoms with a (1×1)
periodicity. They found new occupied states within the gap,
however not separated from the bottom of the conduction band.
It is likely that the calculations were non-spin-polarized.
Hermann et al. [37,38] modelled isolated oxygen defects at
the V2O5(001) surface using a V10O31H12 cluster accounting
for one crystal layer (1L cluster), and the (spin-polarized)
LDA as well as the revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof gradient-
corrected functional (RPBE) [57], the latter with LDA
geometries. The RPBE functional differs from the PBE
functional only in the choice of the mathematical form for
the exchange energy enhancement factor. Oxygen defects were
created by removing one-, two-, or threefold coordinated
surface oxygen atoms. The structures of the reduced clusters
were fully optimized (using LDA only), except for the terminal
hydrogen atoms. (Note that in Refs. [37] and [38], the b- and
c-axis of the bulk unit cell are interchanged compared to the
convention followed here: b and c parallel to the [010] and
[001] directions, respectively.)
Hermann et al. [37,38] found a triplet ground state for
all oxygen defect types (see also Ref. [39]), with the excess
electrons occupying V 3d states at the bottom of the conduction
band and spreading over the close V neighbors to the
defect. This result was obtained using both LDA and RPBE
functionals. The augmentation of the basis set with oxygen
functions localized at the vacant sites on the clusters electronic
structure did not yield lower lying occupied states in the gap
[38].
Besides the 1L cluster, Hermann et al. [37,38] considered
a (V10O31H12)2 cluster accounting for two crystal layers and
reported the changes in the relaxation patterns. On defect
creation lattice relaxations were particularly large for the
terminal oxygen atoms. In the 1L cluster model, the vanadium
atom from which the oxygen atom was moved ∼0.5
˚
A
downwards, while in the larger 2L cluster model, this atom
shifted downwards by 0.94 ˚
A and the vanadyl oxygen beneath
moved upwards by 0.12 ˚
A. As a result, a V–O–V bond between
the layers was formed, cf. Fig. 18(a). Thus, proper description
of this bond formation requires surface models that consist of at
least two crystal layers. It is therefore somewhat surprising that
calculations using 1L cluster models of O(1) defects are still
being published [42].
Recent cluster (PBE and B3LYP) and periodic (PW91)
studies have conﬁrmed the large relaxations induced by the
creation of a single vanadyl defect at the V2O5(001) surface and
the V–O–V bond formation, and have discussed the associated
changes in the electronic structure [40,41]. Ganduglia-Pirovano
and Sauer [41] performed periodic spin-polarized calculations
using a 2L slab (see Fig. 17). All atoms were allowed to relax.
They considered vanadyl defect concentrations in the range
1/6 ≤Θdef ≤1 using (1 × 3), (1 × 2), and (1 × 1) unit cells.
Additionally they considered two- and threefold coordinated
defects at Θdef = 1/4 with (1 × 2) periodicity.
Fig. 18(a) shows the above-mentioned noticeable structure
changes in the immediate vicinity of the O(1) surface defect site,
Vdef, i.e., the inversion of the VO5 pyramid and the considerable
local contraction of the interlayer spacing followed by the
formation of a bond between the layers. The resulting V–O
interlayer bond distances were 1.78 and 1.77 ˚
A. Also, all
Vdef–O and Vb–O bonds within the crystal layers were shorter
by up to ∼0.1 ˚
A compared to the defect-free V2O5(001)
surface.
Ganduglia-Pirovano and Sauer [41] reported the highest spin
state for all vanadyl concentrations 1/6 ≤Θdef ≤1 and
defect structures considered. For the other structurally different
surface oxygen defects at Θdef = 1/4, the ground state was
triplet, in agreement with the calculations of Hermann et al.
[37,38] (cf. Table 7).
Fig. 19 shows the PW91 spin-projected total density of
states of the isolated vanadyl defect (1 × 3) unrelaxed and
relaxed structures at Θdef = 1/6. The difference DOS between
up and down spin projections for the relaxed geometry upon
O-removal is also shown. Virtually no contribution to the
difference DOS from states within the valence band can be
observed. For both geometries, the peak right at the Fermi level
result from the partial occupation of the 3d orbitals on reduced
V cations.
Fig. 20 shows the corresponding spin density distribution
for the unrelaxed and relaxed structures. Without structure
relaxation the two excess electrons localized primarily at the
Vdef site, whereas the interlayer bond formation results in a
partial delocalization of the electrons over nearby metal sites.
Note that the effect extends somewhat beyond the defect site
and its counterpart at the second crystal layer.
At this point, this PW91 result for reduced vanadia systems,
with a calculated band gap of 2.0 eV [41] (exp.: 2.3 eV),
namely, the occupation of V 3d states at the bottom of the
conduction band that are not actually split off, and a too
delocalized electronic structure, should be expected. Indeed,
Sauer and D¨
obler [40] have recently conﬁrmed the spread
of the spin density over adjacent V sites in a (010) plane
containing the defect (see Fig. 21) using the PBE functional
and the (V10O31H12)2 cluster model of Refs. [37] and [38].
The structures of the clean and reduced clusters were fully

optimized (with constraints in selected dihedral angles that
involved terminating hydroxyl groups).
The agreement between the cluster PBE and periodic
PW91 results for the spin density together with that of the
corresponding defect formation energies (see next section)
indicates the adequacy of the cluster model used in Ref. [40].
Differently from these GGA results, the hybrid functional
B3LYP applied to the two-layer cluster model, yielded
localized electrons at the two V sites participating in the
interlayer V–O–V bond only (see Fig. 21 and Table 7). On
the one hand, these results show the importance of both exact
exchange and lattice relaxations for the proper description of
the localized electrons following vanadyl oxygen removal at the
V2O5(001) surface; on the other hand, they render the results
of 1L cluster studies questionable. It is clear that the atomic
displacements following the vanadyl defect formation play an
essential role in the resulting electronic structure; the V defect
site is not reduced to VIII but VIV. Schematically,

here the easiest V–O bond dissociation of surface vanadyl
oxygen atoms (see next section), the results of Refs. [41] and
[40] indicate that lattice relaxation plays a decisive role in
creating VIV sites. Both the gradient-corrected (PW91/PBE)
and hybrid (B3LYP) functionals yielded the V–O–V bond
between the layers, however, differences in the calculated

geometries were obtained. These are to be expected. For
example, the V–O interlayer bond distances were 1.80/1.86
and 1.73/1.69 ˚
A with (cluster) PBE/B3LYP (cf. 1.78 and 1.77
˚
A for periodic PW91, as reported above).
Furthermore, Ganduglia-Pirovano and Sauer [41] found that
the additional lattice relaxations occurring when subsequent
vanadyl defects are created (forming ﬁrstly pairs) along
either the [010] or [100] directions, are distinct. Fig. 18(b)
and (c) display the fully relaxed structures at Θ

induced by defect pairs along the [010] and [100] directions,
respectively. For the former the atomic displacements around
each vacancy were very similar to those for an isolated defect
at Θdef = 1/6 (cf. Fig. 18(a)). That implies that the subsequent
vacancy induced only very small additional changes in the
local structure of the already existing defect. Thus, a non-
counteracting defect induced relaxation effect with increasing
coverage (from 1/6 to 1/3) was found when defects aligned
along the [010] direction. Similar considerations applied when
the concentration is further increased from 1/3 to 1/2 and a
trench-like structure with a (1 × 1) periodicity and vacancy
rows along the [010] direction form. In contrast, the lattice
relaxations induced by subsequent vacancies that form [100]
oriented pairs, were found to somewhat counteract those
occurring after the ﬁrst defect was created (cf. Fig. 18(a) and
(c)). The reason for mentioning this will become apparent in the
next section when discussing the effect of increasing the defect
concentration on the formation energy of surface O(1) defects.
5.3.2. The V2O5(001) surface defect formation energy
Table 7 summarizes the calculated oxygen defect formation
energies at the V2O5(001) surface. Hermann et al. [38] and
Druzini´

values of 6.47/5.48,
7.19/6.70, and 6.49/6.09 for the O(1), O(2), and O(3) defects,
respectively, using the 1L/2L cluster model (for the LDA
geometries). The numbers for the O(2) and O(3) vacancies
correspond to the average between the formation energies
of the two inequivalent O(2) and O(3) defects, respectively
(cf. Fig. 17). In Table 7 these EO
f values have been converted

= 2.83 eV [229] (cf. Eqs. (1) and (2)). Thus,
according to the 2L cluster (RPBE) results, the 1L cluster values
in Ref. [38] are overestimated (by about 1, 0.5, and 0.4 eV for
the O(1), O(2), and O(3) defects, respectively) because of the
limited account for structure relaxations in the small model.
The difference between the E

values obtained using the 1L
and 2L models is particularly large for the O(1) defect which
leads to bond formation between the defective surface layer and
the crystal layer beneath. The ease of removal of the terminal
vanadyl oxygen atoms may be inferred, considering the 2L
cluster (RPBE) values.
Ganduglia-Pirovano and Sauer [41] have recently reported
that the formation energy of an isolated O(1) defect is smaller
than that of O(2) and O(3) defects by about a factor of two with
E

f
= 1.95, 3.65, and 3.97 eV for the O(1), O(2), and O(3),
respectively. These numbers resulted from PW91 periodic 2L
slab calculations for each inequivalent surface oxygen site at
Θdef = 1/4; the formation energy of O(2) and O(3) defects
correspond to average values. At Θdef = 1/4, the signiﬁcant
relaxations upon vanadyl oxygen removal contributed to a
reduction of the energy from 3.78 to 1.95 eV. An additional
20 meV decrease is gained if the defect separation along the
[010] direction is increased from 2 · b to 3 · b (i.e., a defect
concentration decrease from 1/4 to 1/6, cf. Table 7). Thus,
the value of 1.93 eV represents the isolated O(1) defect limit
at the PW91 level. (Note that the extention of the V2O5(001)
slab from 2L to 3L yielded deviations of ∼3 meV.)
The RPBE functional is known to yield improved energies
(i.e., to reduce the PBE or PW91 characteristic overbinding)
[57]. The RPBE and PW91 O2 dissociation energy (E
1
2 O2
d
) used
in the evaluation of the defect formation energies of Refs. [39]
and [41] (2.83 and 3.13 eV/atom, respectively) are by 0.24 and
0.54 eV larger than the experimental value (2.59 eV/atom).
However, the (2L cluster) RPBE defect formation energies
(E
1
2 O2
f
) are not lower than the (2L slab) PW91 values for all
defect types (cf. Table 7). In particular, for the O(1) defect
the RPBE formation energy is about 0.7 eV larger than the
(periodic) PW91 limit (cf. 2.65 and 1.93 eV).
Sauer and D¨
obler [40] calculated the vanadyl defect
formation energy using the 2L cluster with PBE for the

(cf. Table 7) with a relaxation energy contribution of 1.90 eV
was in very good agreement with the (periodic) PW91 value
of 1.93 eV (1.83 eV contribution from relaxation) for Θdef =
1/6. As already mentioned, the PBE and PW91 functionals
are constructed so as to yield essentially the same results for
structure and bond dissociation energies. Hence, this agreement

is a clear indication of the adequacy of the cluster approach
in Ref. [40] and raises some questions about quality of the 2L
cluster RPBE results in Refs. [38] and [39]. To fully understand
the origin of the RPBE overbinding, which may be due in part
to the quality of the basis set, would require a very systematic
testing.
When more than just isolated defects are created, the
separation between them decreases and defects may interact.
Ganduglia-Pirovano and Sauer [41] calculated the average
defect formation energy of eight different structures at varying
defect concentration with 1/3 ≤Θdef ≤1 (PW91 functional).
Increasing the defect concentration from 1/4 to 1/3 led to an
increase in the formation energy by ∼20 meV (from 1.95 to
1.97 eV) when [100] oriented pairs formed, whereas a decrease
by 50 and 80 meV was found when defect pairs (Θdef = 1/3)
and rows (Θdef = 1/2) formed along the [010] direction,
respectively (cf. Table 7). The lowest defect formation energy
was found for the trenchlike structure with missing rows along
the [010] direction at Θdef = 1/2.
The preference for the [010] alignment over other defect
structures as the defect concentration increases from 1/6
to 1/3 and up to 1/2, was explained using the relaxation
effects described in the previous section [41]. Speciﬁcally,
the defects share the energy of inverting the VO5 pyramids
when subsequent defects are created along the [010] direction,
and the formation energy of each additional defect decreases
from 1.93 (Θdef = 1/6) to 1.87 (Θdef = 1/3) to 1.83 eV
(Θdef = 1/2). In contrast, starting from an isolated defect
site, the formation energy of an additional defect forming a
[100] oriented pair increases by 0.27 eV due to counteracting
lattice relaxation effects which render the reduction of the
surface along this direction rather unlikely. Combining the
DFT calculations with statistical thermodynamics, the stability
of a missing-row structure under reducing conditions was
predicted. This DFT (PW91) prediction appear to be consistent
with STM observations of a non-random vanadyl oxygen
defect distribution at the V2O5(001) surface, which are created
at room temperature under UHV [228]. Furthermore, it is
250
M.V. Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. / Surface Science Reports 62 (2007) 219–270
compatible with the recently observed [227] metal–insulator
transition at 350–400 K (UHV), which expands preferentially
in the [010] direction (cf. Section 5.2).
As mentioned above, the use of hybrid functionals is
expected to yield improved defect formation energies. Using
the 2L cluster model, Sauer and D¨
obler [40] calculated the
vanadyl oxygen defect formation energy with the B3LYP
functional for the correspondingly relaxed geometry. They
obtained E
1
2 O2
f
= 1.17 eV with a relaxation contribution of
1.79 eV (cf. Table 7). Thus, the use of exact-exchange resulted
not only in the complete localization of the excess electrons
upon vanadyl oxygen removal (cf. previous section) but also
yielded a particularly small value for the corresponding defect
formation energy that is consistent with the distinct sensitivity
of the V2O5(001) surface to any probing beam (cf. Section 5.2).
The ∼0.7 eV difference between the E
1
2 O2
f
values obtained
using the PBE and B3LYP functionals (cf. 1.83 and 1.17
eV), is related to the different description of the V=O and
O–O binding at the oxide surface and in the O2 molecule,
respectively, with gradient-corrected and hybrid functionals
(cf. Section 3.3.1).
The B3LYP prediction of about 1.2 eV is somewhat smaller
than the experimental estimates from electrical conductivity
measurements in molten V2O5 of 1.3–1.5 eV [230], whereas
the GGA value of 1.9 is clearly larger. The better performance
of B3LYP for V=O bond dissociation energies with respect to
GGA functionals, is compatible with the corresponding results
obtained for the O=V=O+ cation [40]. B3LYP yielded results
that deviate by less than 0.1 eV from a multi-reference ab initio
calculation and were within the error bars from experiment,
whereas GGA functionals gave overestimated values by more
than 1 eV.
Here, it is important to mention that similar to the isolated
O(1) defect formation energy, the PW91 values for higher
defect concentrations are overestimated. However, we expect
the general stability trend to be valid; corresponding (larger
cluster or periodic) B3LYP studies would be desirable.
5.4. Summary V2O5
The study of the formation of (vanadyl) oxygen vacancies at
the V2O5(001) surface with DFT (cluster and periodic) methods
using local, gradient-corrected, and hybrid functionals led to a
number of interesting observations that are summarized next.
The relaxation pattern at the (001) surface of the layered
V2O5 structure upon reduction is particular, i.e., without an
analogue among the TM oxide surfaces discussed so far (TiO2
and ZrO2). Similar to TiO2(110), lattice rearrangements extend
up to two (slab) layers. At the V2O5(001) surface, however, the
atom displacements can be signiﬁcantly larger, up to ∼1 ˚
A.
The terminal vanadyl defects are a special case among the
different types of surface oxygen atoms; they are the easiest to
form. Vanadyl defect formation at the V2O5(001) surface leads
to V–O–V bond formation between the two outermost crystal
layers. Both gradient-corrected (periodic and cluster) and
hybrid functionals (cluster) describe this lattice rearrangement
reasonably well provided that the model includes two crystal
layers.
The vanadyl defect induced structure relaxation plays an
essential role in the resulting electronic structure and in
reducing the energy to create such defects. Without relaxation a
VIII site would form on oxygen removal, whereas the formation
of a V–O–V interlayer bond leads to the creation of two VIV
sites instead.
With GGA functionals, independent of the surface model,
the electrons left in the system upon vanadyl defect formation,
spread over adjacent V sites in a (010) plane containing the
defect, and occupy V 3d states at the bottom of the conduction
band. These states are not split from the conduction band
at variance with what has been observed. The use of hybrid
functionals led to the complete localization of the excess
electrons on the V atoms forming the interlayer bond. The
resulting electronic ground state is triplet; that of higher vanadyl
defect concentrations as well as that of all other types of isolated
defects is (also) high spin.
There is a clear agreement on the results of the cluster and
periodic gradient-corrected studies (PBE/PW91) of (isolated)
vanadyl oxygen defects at the V2O5(001) surface, namely,
on the limitations of GGA functionals. The use of a hybrid
approach (B3LYP) utilizing the (validated) cluster model yields
not only an improved description of the electronic structure of
reduced V2O5 but a quantitative difference in the oxygen defect
formation energy, namely, a ∼0.7 eV lowering of the (isolated)
vanadyl defect formation energy. Hence, the hybrid functional
represents an important tool to interpret and complement
the experimental information on reduced V2O5(001), and
considerably enhances the predictive power of DFT with GGA
functionals. Yet, we recognize the merit of PW91 in predicting
the alignment of vanadyl defects along the [010] direction and
the formation of a missing-row structure at Θdef = 1/2. Line
defects are favored by the sharing of the energy needed to
deform the structure.
6. Cerium oxide
6.1. CeO2 applications and basic information
The major application of the RE oxide ceria (CeO2)
is in catalysis [3]. Its main use is connected with the
reduction of noxious components from automotive exhaust
gases. The cleaning system comprises a three-way catalyst
which uses a ceramic or metallic substrate with an active
coating incorporating alumina, ceria, and other oxides and
combinations of metals such as platinum, palladium, and
rhodium. The importance of ceria in catalysis originates from
its remarkable oxygen storage capability, i.e., its ability to
undergo rapid and repeatable redox cycles depending on the
conditions in the reactor stream. This feature is strongly
related to the facile creation, healing, and diffusion of oxygen
vacancies, especially at the ceria surfaces. In addition, ceria has
potential uses in fuel cell technology [231–235].
CeO2 exists in the cubic ﬂuorite structure (CaF2), i.e., the
same structure as c-ZrO2 (aexp = 5.41 ˚
A) [236,237]. It consists

of a cubic array of fourfold coordinated oxygen ions, with the
metal ions occupying half of the eightfold coordinated cationic
interstices. The relative stability of the low-index ceria surfaces
decreases in the (111) > (110) > (100) order [51,238,239].
The non-polar CeO2(111) surface is observed to undergo little
relaxation [240,241].
It is terminated by threefold coordinated oxygen atoms,
O(3), and exhibits sevenfold coordinated cerium atoms, Ce(7)
(see Fig. 22) [242–245]. The (110) and (100) surfaces undergo
signiﬁcant surface relaxations [246–248]. The (110) surface is
terminated by a CeO2 plane with threefold oxygen and sixfold
coordinated cerium atoms, Ce(6), whereas the (100) surface is
terminated by twofold coordinated oxygen atoms, O(2).
CeO2 is an insulator. The experimental band gap is 6.0 eV
between the O 2p and Ce 5d states [249–252]. The nature of the
electronic ground state was controversial. One scenario featured
a formally fully occupied O 2p band and empty 4f states (Ce
4f0) in the band gap [250,253–257], and the other involved a
mixture of Ce 4f0 and Ce 4f1O2p-hole states [258–260]. The
intermediate valence of the latter was deduced mostly from
core-level XPS [258,259,261]. The analysis of the CeO2 XPS
spectra is not straightforward and one cannot easily conclude
from the ﬁnal state photoemission spectra on the intermediate
valence of the initial state. In general, the experimentally
obtained 4f occupancy does not distinguish localized from
extended f-symmetry states in the initial state [262]. There is
agreement with the facts that the valence band contains a non-
negligible admixture of f-symmetry, and that the occupancy
of strictly localized 4f states (if any) is very small [250,262].
On the basis of optical reﬂectivity measurements, a possible
partial occupation of the 4f1 states of less than 5% could not
be excluded [256]. These states are located about 1.5 eV above
the Fermi level with a measured full width at half maximum
of 1.2 eV [250]. When CeO2 is exposed to reducing conditions
(i.e., low O2 pressure and high temperature), the existence of
these unoccupied f-states close to the Fermi level results in the
change of the nature of the electronic states associated with the
f-electrons as discussed in the next section.
6.2. Experimental ﬁndings on oxygen vacancies
Like in ZrO2, it is possible to accommodate a large number
of mobile oxygen vacancies in ceria by doping with aliovalent
cations [263–265], but also by oxygen removal. Oxygen can
either be removed from the bulk by annealing [266] with
subsequent diffusion to the surface, or directly from the surface
by annealing, sputtering [252,267–269], electron irradiation
[250], exposure to X-rays [270], or chemical reduction [271,
272].
In oxides, cerium has two oxidation states, CeIII and CeIV.
In fact, removal of oxygen from ceria, when exposed to an
O2 deﬁcient atmosphere at high temperatures, leads to the
formation of several cerium oxide phases of the type CeO2−x
with a range of possible compositions (0 ≤x ≤0.5) [273–
275].
A great deal of experimental work was devoted to
the determination of the oxidation state of Ce at reduced
CeO2 surfaces. Using several techniques, such as X-ray
and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and high-
resolution energy loss spectroscopy [243,252,268,269,276–
278], UV–Vis diffuse reﬂectance, and infrared spectroscopy
[271], and EPR [279], indications for the presence of CeIII at
the surface and in deeper layers were found. In particular, an
additional emission at a binding energy of 1.2–1.5 eV above
the top of the O 2p band in the band gap is observed in
the UPS spectra of reduced surfaces [243,252,268,269,278].
252
M.V. Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. / Surface Science Reports 62 (2007) 219–270
The additional peak is assigned to emission from localized
Ce 4f orbitals. Thus, the excess electrons left behind upon
oxygen removal occupy strongly localized f states driving the
CeIV →CeIII reduction. We note here and discuss below
that any proper theoretical description of reduced ceria systems
needs to be able to treat both, the CeIV4f electrons participating
to the bonding and the tightly bound CeIII4f electrons. This
requirement challenges computational approaches more than
the proper description of reduced 3d (TiO2, V2O5) or 4d (ZrO2)
TM oxides discussed so far.
Using STM and noncontact atomic force microscopy the
structure of reduced surfaces was imaged [240,244,245,247,
267,280]. Oxygen defects created by annealing the (111)
surface were found to be either isolated or aggregated in
extended clusters [240,244,245,267,280]. For the slightly
reduced surface, defect clusters were not dominant and
both surface and subsurface defects were present at similar
concentrations. Upon prolonged annealing, linear (surface)
defect clusters became dominant with triangular clusters being
next most abundant. Esch et al. [280] have recently reported
that actually subsurface defects are required to nucleate linear
surface clusters that expose exclusively reduced CeIII ions.
6.3. Reduced low-index CeO2 surfaces
Theoretical studies on reduced ceria surfaces used classical
interatomic potentials [43,44], periodic DFT with the local
density and gradient-corrected functionals, and the DFT +
U approach [46,50–52,280]. Embedded-cluster calculations
[90] with explicit treatment of the electron correlations by
Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) were also employed.
In contrast to the transition (d) metal oxides discussed so far, no
(periodic or cluster) study of partially reduced CeO2 systems
(surfaces and bulk) using hybrid approaches has been reported
yet.
6.3.1. Structure relaxation and electronic structure
Earlier studies of reduced ceria surfaces using force-ﬁelds
[43,44] assumed the existence of two CeIII ions per neutral
oxygen defect, and the more recent calculations using gradient-
corrected functionals badly fail to describe the excess electrons
localization upon reduction as discussed below [46,50,51].
Yang et al. [46] considered the reduction of the (111)
and (110) CeO2 surfaces (see Fig. 22) and employed the
(spin-polarized) PW91 functional [157]. The surfaces were
modelled as periodically repeated (in z-direction) slabs. The
(111) oriented surface contained four O–Ce–O repeating units
(or slab layers), while the (110) surface consisted of ﬁve
identical planes with CeO2 stoichiometry. Lattice relaxations
upon reduction were taken into account with the bottom 2L of
both slabs ﬁxed at their bulk positions. Defects were considered
at the surface and in the subsurface oxygen atomic layers at two
concentrations. Speciﬁcally, orthorhombic p(
√
3 × 1) [Θdef =
1/2] and p(
√
3 × 2) [Θdef = 1/4] unit cells were used for the
(111) orientation, while p(1 × 2) [Θdef = 1/4] and p(2 × 2)
[Θdef = 1/8] cells were used for the (110) surface. In this
(a′×b′) nomenclature of the (reduced) surface unit cells the a′-
and b′-axis are parallel to the bulk [11¯
2] and [¯
110] directions for
the (111) orientation, and to the [1¯
10] and [00¯
1] directions for
the (110). Within this choice the p(
√
3 × 1) (111) and p(1 × 2)
(110) surface unit cell has dimensions of 1
2
√
6a × 1
2
√
2a and
a ×
√
2a (with a the bulk lattice parameter), respectively.
Yang et al. [46] reported that the structural modiﬁcations
induced by the surface defects at the differently oriented
surfaces followed a quite general pattern, namely, Ce atoms
nearest neighbors to the vacant site moved away from the defect
while O atoms next-nearest neighbors contracted in the vacant
region. Moreover, the resulting atomic structures provided
some insight into the (inadequate) PW91 description of the
electronic structure of the corresponding reduced surfaces. For
example, for the (111) surface at Θdef = 1/4, the initially (by
symmetry) equivalent three Ce atoms neighboring the defects
remained equivalent upon reduction, i.e., no distorted structure
formed around the vacant sites. Thus, in this ﬁnal geometry,
there cannot be just two neighboring CeIII ions to the defects.
CeIII ions have a larger atomic radius than the CeIV and this
should be reﬂected in different Ce–O bond lengths.
The detailed analysis of the electronic structure of the
reduced systems for the example of the (111) p(
√
3 × 1) and
(110) p(1 × 2) structures, yielded metallic ground states with
the excess electrons distributed rather evenly on the Ce atoms
of the three outermost layers. An antiparallel magnetic order for
the (111) p(
√
3 × 1) structure and a parallel magnetic order for
the (110) p(1 × 2) reduced surface were found (see Table 8).
The inadequacy of PW91 to provide a proper account of
the Ce valency change upon reduction of surfaces of ceria as
shown by Yang et al. [46], has been conﬁrmed recently [50,51].
Fabris et al. [50] and Nolan et al. [51] investigated defective
ceria surfaces using the PBE and PW91 functional, respectively,
and both described metallic ground states and report on the
failure of GGA functionals. The LDA approximation fails as
well [50]. We note the importance of properly accounting
for the overlap between core and valence densities in the
description of the electronic structure of reduced ceria systems
[49,281]; the inclusion of the nonlinear core corrections in the
pseudopotentials has little effect on the structural properties,
though. Fig. 23 shows an isosurface of spin-density for the
example of the reduced p(2 × 1) (100) surface (Θdef = 1/4) of
the work of Nolan et al. [51]. The ground state was triplet. The
complete delocalization of the excess electrons is clearly seen.
We observe that the extent of the excess charge delocalization
is greater than that for the TM oxides discussed so far. The
unphysical self-interaction introduced by gradient-corrected
functionals can be substantial for the cases in which the orbital
overlaps are small, the bands narrow, and the electrons nearly
localize in atomic-like orbitals [60], resulting in the complete
failure of the GGA approximations.
Both Nolan et al. [51,52] and Fabris et al. [50] further
applied periodic spin-polarized DFT + U approaches which
represent a very pragmatic way to overcome the limitations of
GGA functionals (see Section 2). The former studied surface
oxygen defects at the (111), (110), and (100) ceria surfaces
using PW91 + U [157] with an empirically determined U′ = 5
eV together with projectors based on standard Ce 4f atomic

numerically for the isolated atom in the reference conﬁguration
[Xe] 4f15d16s2. The (111), (110), and (100) surfaces were
modelled using 4L, 7L, and 3L symmetric slabs (i.e., with
oxygen defects on both sides), respectively. They considered
a defect concentration of 1/4 using p(2 × 2) (hexagonal),
p(1 × 2), p(2 × 1) for the (111), (110), and (100) orientations,
respectively. The latter investigated reduced (111) and (110)
surfaces employing both the LDA + U (U ′ = 5.3 eV) and
PBE + U (U ′ = 4.5 eV) approaches [282] with two different
choices for the localized Ce 4f-orbitals, namely standard atomic
orbitals and the Wannier functions [283] that resulted from self-
consistently calculated Ce 4f bands. The Wannier orbitals are
becoming common in recent schemes to deal with strongly
correlated electrons [284,285]. The U′ values were determined
using a method based on a linear response approach by
Cococcioni and de Gironcoli [99], as applied to bulk Ce2O3 [48,
49]. Fabris et al. [50] considered a (111) 3L slab (4L to model
subsurface defects) and defect concentrations of 1/2 and 1/4
using orthorhombic p(
√
3 × 1) and hexagonal p(2 × 2) unit
cells, respectively, whereas for a 6L (110) slab, they studied
Θdef = 1/4 and 1/8 using p(1 × 2) and p(2 × 2) cells,
respectively. Yet, they discussed in detail their results for the
lower concentrations only.
Both DFT+U studies [50,52] considered lattice relaxations.
In Ref. [50] only the upper half of the non-symmetric slabs
(containing the defect) was allowed to relax. The resulting
geometries of the (111) and (110) surfaces with defects at
the surface layer could be compared and they were in good
quantitative agreement. This suggests that structural properties
do not signiﬁcantly depend on the various variants of the
DFT + U method used; however, that is not the case for
the defect formation energies (see Sections 6.4 and 6.3.2).
Similar to the PW91 relaxation pattern described above, as
calculated by Yang et al. [46], with DFT + U the closest Ce
and O atoms to the defect moved away from and towards the
defect site, respectively [50,52]. However, the DFT+U surface
relaxations were more complex than the corresponding GGA
ones. Fig. 24(a) and (c) display the PBE + U optimized (111)
and (110) with a surface defect concentration of 1/4 and 1/8,
respectively, calculated with the localized Wannier orbitals as
obtained by Fabris et al. [50], as examples.
For the (111) surface defect, for instance, the initial
hexagonal symmetry around the defect is distorted, in contrast
to the earlier PW91 calculations [46]. Namely, the two
nearest neighbor Ce atoms relaxed further (0.16 ˚
A) than
the third one (0.11 ˚
A). There is also an asymmetry in the
amount by which the bond lengths between these Ce atoms
and the oxygen atoms in the second oxygen atomic layer
(next-nearest neighbors) were contracted (by 0.18 or 0.06
˚
A). The smallest contraction corresponded to oxygen atoms
bonded to those two Ce atoms that relaxed further. The six
surface oxygen atoms (third nearest neighbors to the defect)
relaxed by 0.09
˚
A outward perpendicular to the surface
(see Fig. 24(a)). There was some very weak perturbation of
inner atomic layers. The resulting (asymmetric) relaxed (111)
structures are compatible with recent STM images of oxygen
vacancies at and below the surface [280], and are expected
if Ce atoms in different oxidation states are present at the
surface.
In contrast to the GGA results [46,50,51] which predicted
metallic ground states, both DFT + U calculations [50,52]
yielded insulating solutions with ﬁlled f states in the band
gap. The spin analysis in Ref. [50] showed that the reduced
(111) surfaces were antiferromagnetic while the defective
(110) surface was ferromagnetic, in agreement with the PW91
calculations by Yang et al. [46], whereas in Ref. [52] the
ground state was ferromagnetic for all three orientations; it is
likely that the magnitude of the energy difference between the
(open-shell) singlet and triplet solutions is small (i.e., less than
0.1 eV). This statement is supported by DFT and DFT + U
calculations on partially reduced bulk CeO2 and Ce2O3 for

which such difference was never larger than 0.1 eV [49,54,89,
281,286].
Fig. 25(b), (c), and (d) display the spin-polarized PBE + U
density of states of the reduced (111) and (110) surfaces of
Fig. 24(a), (b), and (c), respectively [50]. The position of the
occupied f states for the reduced (111) and (110) surfaces
is approximately 1.5 and 1.4 eV, respectively, above the top
of the valence band (1.9 and 1.8 eV in LDA + U). Nolan
et al. [51,52] also obtained occupied f states in the band gap
using PW91 + U which were at 1.1, 1.0, and 0.9 eV above
the top of the valence band for the reduced (111), (110),
and (100) surfaces, respectively, i.e., by about ∼0.4 eV closer
to the valence band edge compared to the results of Fabris
et al. [50] (cf. Table 8). This difference may be due to the
different DFT + U implementations. These occupied levels
can be related to the observed additional emission in the UPS
spectra of reduced surfaces [243,252,268,269,278] at binding
energies of 1.2–1.5 eV above the top of the O 2p band (see
Section 6.2).
For all reduced surfaces, the occupied states were due to the
formation of CeIII ions. Charge density isosurfaces of the gap
states are shown at the bottom panel of Fig. 24 for a defect at the
(111) surface [Fig. 24(a)], below the (111) surface [Fig. 24(b)],
and at the (110) surface [Fig. 24(c)]. That for the (100) defective
surfaces is displayed in Fig. 23(a). In all cases, localization
of charge is observed at the two closest Ce atoms to the
defect. Thus, the occupied states unequivocally arise from the
formation of reduced CeIII ions with an electronic conﬁguration
4f1, in agreement with many experimental observations (see
Section 6.2).
Herschend et al. [90] employed unrestricted (but also
restricted open-shell) HF and MP2 methods to deal with
the strong on-site correlation effects that tend to localize
the excess electrons in atomic-like orbitals. They investigated
the reduced CeO2(110) surface using an embedded cluster
approach. The embedded cluster Ce10O20 used consisted of
3L of composition Ce2O8, Ce6O8, and Ce2O4 in the ﬁrst,
second and third layer, respectively. We refer to Ref. [287]
for details about the embedding scheme. The oxygen defect
was created by removing one of the central surface threefold
coordinated oxygen atoms. An all-electron basis set for the
O atoms and two different basis sets with an effective core
potential for the Ce atoms were used (see Table 8). The larger
basis set included f-functions and was of double-ζ valence
quality while a reduced version did not contain f-functions
and the most diffuse sp-shell. The smaller basis was used
for those atoms which were assumed to remain CeIV, namely
all but the four most central Ce atoms. Thus, in this model

only ﬁrst neighbor CeIV ions have the possibility to become
CeIII.
Upon defect formation, the geometries of the reduced
clusters were only partially reoptimized at the UHF level by
relaxing just one O atom and two Ce atoms closest to the
defect (but the removed oxygen was threefold coordinated).
Despite the relatively limited relaxation, the (UHF) resulting
atomic displacements in the immediate vicinity of the defect
led to longer Ce–Ce and shorter Ce–O distances in qualitative
agreement with the periodic DFT + U studies [50,51].
With respect to the defect induced changes in the electronic
structure, nothing importantly different from the results of the
DFT + U calculations was obtained (cf. Table 8). At both the
UHF and UMP2 levels, the ground state of the reduced cluster
was a ferromagnetic insulator with the two excess electrons
localized at the two closest Ce atoms, and a new occupied state
appeared in the band gap. However, since they only reported
densities of states from UHF calculations, the peak position
cannot be directly compared to those of DFT+U. As we already
mentioned using the example of TiO2, the HF method is known
to signiﬁcantly exaggerate band gaps (see Section 3.3.1).
In brief, the embedded cluster calculations using UHF
and UMP2 did not lead to qualitative differences in the
calculated geometric and electronic structures compared to
periodic DFT + U. However, all of them strongly disagree with
plain DFT (LDA/GGA) results.
6.3.2. The surface defect formation energy
Despite the PW91 description of the electronic structure of
reduced ceria surfaces being incorrect, the associated defect
formation energies were calculated. Yang et al. [46] reported

values for the (111) defective surface with defects at the
surface (Θdef = 1/4 and 1/2) which are by about 0.2 eV larger
than those for subsurface defects (cf. Table 8). For the (110)
reduced structures, surface defects were preferred by about 0.5
and 0.9 eV at Θdef = 1/4 and 1/8, respectively. The decrease
of Θdef from 1/2 to 1/4 and from 1/4 to 1/8 while increasing
the closest defect separation between (most stable) defects by

A [ 1

A [a(

2 −1)] at the
(111) and (110) surfaces, respectively, resulted in the reduction
of the defect formation energy by 0.6–0.7 eV. Moreover, less
energy is required to form stable defects at the (110) surface
than on (111) (cf. 3.17 (110) and 3.21 eV (111) for Θdef = 1/4
in Table 8). This dependence of E

on the surface orientation
was already noticed in the earlier force-ﬁeld calculations [43,
44]. We note here and discuss later in this section that the
preference for the subsurface to accommodate oxygen defects
at the (111) oriented surface using PW91 is not in particularly
good agreement with the recent experimental observations by
Esch et al. [280]: upon short annealing, surface and subsurface
defects formed in the same proportion (cf. Section 6.2).
The E
1
2 O2
f
values as obtained with DFT + U deserve
some discussion. Inspection of Table 8 reveals that according
to all DFT + U calculations [50,52], i.e., for all different
implementations, the formation energies of defects at the (111)
surface are larger than for the (110) orientation (independent
of the defect location at the (111) surface). These ﬁndings
are in qualitative agreement with those obtained using PW91
discussed above [46]. However, we observe that actual values
may lie within a wide energy range of up to ∼3 eV depending
on the actual details of the DFT + U implementations used.
Fabris et al. [50] provided four completely different values
for each defect position at the (2 × 2) reduced (111) and (110)
structures (Θdef = 1/4). For the surface positions at the (111)
and (110) surfaces, the PBE + U (LDA + U) energies with
the projector functions based on standard atomic orbitals were
2.15 (2.92) and 1.57 (2.33) eV respectively. When the Wannier
orbitals were employed the corresponding values became 4.95
(6.10) and 4.42 (5.50) eV, respectively. The values for the
subsurface position at the (111) surface were 1.89 (2.95) eV
with atomic orbitals, and 4.81 (6.25) eV with Wannier orbitals.
Nolan et al. [52] considered only the surface position at the
(111), (110), and (100) surfaces and computed E

f
= 2.60,
1.99, and 2.27 eV, respectively, at Θdef = 1/4 using PW91 + U
(U ′ = 5.0) (cf. Table 8). The values for the (111) and (110)
orientations differ by ∼0.4 eV from those of Ref. [50] that
were calculated using projectors based on standard atomic
orbitals (as in Ref. [52]) and the PBE + U (U ′
=
4.5)
functional (cf. 2.60 with 2.15 eV (111) as well as 1.99 with
1.57 eV (110) in Table 8). The reason for this discrepancy
may be related to the different U ′ values, but also to the
choice for the pseudopotentials, cutoff, and other details of the
M.V. Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. / Surface Science Reports 62 (2007) 219–270
257
model. However, much more dramatic effects were obtained
for different choices for the projector functions (but the
same functional and computational technique), as well as for
different underlying functionals (GGA or LDA) with identical
projector functions. The calculated values of Fabris et al. [50]
using the self-consistently calculated Wannier functions are
about twice as large as those obtained from standard atomic
orbitals, whereas discrepancies due to different underlying
functionals are less severe. We deem the performance of
DFT + U for predicting defect formation energies at ceria
surfaces unsatisfactory. However, does the relative stability of
surface/subsurface defects depend on the methodology?
The surface/subsurface stability at the (111) surface showed
qualitative different results between PBE + U and LDA +
U calculations [50]. Speciﬁcally, the subsurface position was
more stable in the PBE + U approximation by 0.26 and 0.14
eV when using the standard and the Wannier local functions,
respectively (cf. Table 8). The subsurface preference is in
agreement with the PW91 result by Yang et al. [46] (0.18
eV). Quite differently, the LDA + U predicted the surface
defects to be more stable by 0.03 (atomic orbitals) and 0.15 eV
(Wannier orbitals). The latter are in better agreement with the
already mentioned high-resolution STM of the (111) surface
where surface and subsurface defects were initially present in
equivalent proportions [280]. The reason for this discrepancy
between the LDA+U and GGA+U calculations is unclear. This
inconsistency is particularly disturbing because of the failure
to produce reliable relative energies of defect formation in this
speciﬁc example.
A possible remedy to these problems is, in principle, the
use of hybrid functionals [58,59,80,81,84,85], which include a
certain amount of Fock exchange. We have seen above that in
transition (d) metal oxides (e.g., TiO2 [12,23,25], V2O5 [40])
hybrid functional approaches yield accurate oxygen defect
formation energies and a proper description of the extent of
the localization of the electrons left behind upon reduction.
But also, it has been recently shown that they can correctly
reproduce the ground state properties of strongly correlated
systems (e.g., containing f electrons) for which LDA and GGA
approximations are known to be from inadequate to completely
wrong [75–77,89,281,288–292]. As already mentioned, such
calculations have not been performed for partially reduced ceria
systems yet, but would be desirable. The reason may be that
electronic convergence of spin-polarized DFT calculations with
hybrid functionals is extremely hard to achieve for systems with
(few) localized f electrons [89].
The recent cluster calculation at the MP2 level by Herschend
et al. [90] predicted a defect formation energy at the Ce(110)
surface of 3.26 eV. Compared to the DFT + U values in
Table 9, the MP2 result deviates by about 0.9–2.2 eV. The
closest LDA + U value of 2.33 eV was obtained using
the standard projectors [50]; an approach that had produced
the experimentally observed similar stabilities for defects at
the surface and subsurface positions at the (111) surface.
Unfortunately, DFT results are not available for the cluster
model, which — by comparison with calculations on periodic
models — would allow for a judgement of the quality of the
cluster model.
6.4. Reduced CeO2 bulk
The
above-discussed
limitations
of
LDA
and
GGA
functionals in dealing with the change in valency of cerium
atoms upon reduction of ceria surfaces also apply to the
reduced bulk. In terms of the electronic structure, partially
reduced ceria represents an intermediate case between CeO2
and Ce2O3 in which all the Ce ions are in the CeIV and CeIII
oxidation state, respectively. Ce2O3 is an antiferromagnetic
insulator with a single occupied Ce 4f peak 2.4 eV below the
conduction band [293], which is formed to a large extent by Ce
5d + 4f states. Local and gradient-corrected functionals yield
a ferromagnetic metallic and semi-metallic (with ∼10 meV
between the occupied f state and the bottom of the conduction
band) ground state, respectively, when the Ce 4f electrons
are treated explicitly as valence electrons [49,54,77,89,281,
286,294]. DFT + U and hybrid functionals were employed
in the study of Ce2O3 [49,54,77,89,281,286], however for
CeO2−x with 0 < x < 0.5, only plain DFT (LDA/GGA)
and DFT+U calculations were performed [45–47,49,50,53,54].
Similar to the ceria surfaces, a broad range of calculated defect
formation energies was obtained from these investigations, and
the question for a converged bulk defect formation energy has
remained unanswered.
Skorodumova et al. [45] performed spin-polarized FP-
LMTO [295,296] calculations with the PW91 functional (see
Ref. [297]). They employed a Ce32O64 unit cell consisting
of eight elementary cells of CeO2 for which relaxations of
the atomic positions upon reduction were probably considered,
however not explicitly mentioned. They treated the Ce 4f states
within two simple models, as valence band states and as fully
localized core states. In the former case, the 5s, 5p, 5d, 4f, and
6s basis functions were included in the Ce valence basis set (12
valence electrons), whereas only 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s states were
included when the f electron was treated as a localized core
(i.e., 11 valence electrons). The basis for the O atom contained
2s, 2p, and 3d basis functions.
For the calculation of the oxygen defect formation energy
in CeO2, Skorodumova et al. [45] removed an oxygen atom
from the Ce32O64 cell while treating the 4f electrons of all Ce
atoms as valence electrons and obtained a value of 4.55 eV with
respect to 1/2O2 (see Table 9). Moreover, they also created a
defect in the 96 atoms cell with two CeIII centers at different
Ce lattice positions, i.e., the 4f electrons of two Ce atoms
where treated as core electrons. (Note that in Eq. (2) both the
unreduced and reduced cells contained the two CeIII species.)
The defect formation energy for oxygen next to the pair of CeIII
sites was lowest, and by 4.29 eV lower than for the cell in which
electron localization had not been imposed, i.e., E

f
= 0.26
eV. Using these numbers Skorodumova et al. [45] argued that
the oxygen vacancy formation in CeO2 is greatly facilitated by
the simultaneous localization of two electrons into f states of
two cerium atoms neighboring the oxygen that leaves; however,
the predictive power of this approach is limited since the

distribution of reduced centers has to be assumed. Moreover,
the calculated energies cannot be compared between systems
with a different number of CeIII sites.
Yang et al. [46], Jiang et al. [47], and Fabris et al. [48–50]
also performed gradient-corrected calculations of reduced ceria
using a 12-, 96-, and 24-atom unit cell, respectively, in which
the 4f electrons of all cerium atoms were treated as valence
electrons. The latter also performed calculations with the LDA.
For all calculations the atoms were allowed to relax upon
defect formation (relaxations were not explicitly mentioned in
Ref. [46], though). Recently, Andersson et al. [54] considered
the 96-atom cell and both LDA and PW91.
The PBE defect formation energy of 3.62 eV for the (2×2×
2) supercell of Jiang et al. [47] is by about 0.5 eV larger than the
recent PW91 value of 3.13 eV [54], using the same supercell.
These values are by 0.9 and 1.4 eV smaller than the FP-LMTO-
PW91 value of 4.55 eV [45], respectively (cf. Table 9). Several
factors may contribute to these differences such as a different
core description (PAW in Refs. [47] and [54] and all-electron
in Ref. [45]), the number of integration points in the irreducible
wedge of the Brillouin zone (Γ-point in Ref. [47] and eight
k-points in Refs. [45]) and [54]; one needs more than just the
Γ-point for metallic systems. The extent of lattice relaxations
considered may also differ and last but not least, deviations may
be partly reﬂecting differences in the calculated O2 dissociation
energies as discussed in Section 3.3.2. However, the E
1
2 O2
d
values used in Refs. [45,47], and [54] were not reported. It is
clearly non-trivial to understand the origin of these signiﬁcant
differences without careful testing.
Yang et al. [46] calculated a PW91 defect formation energy
in bulk ceria of 4.73 eV for the (1 × 1 × 1) supercell.
Thus, according to their surface defect formation energies,
oxygen defects were predicted to be more stable within the
outermost oxygen layers [(111): subsurface; (110): surface]
than in the bulk (cf. Table 8). Moreover, the E
1
2 O2
f
bulk value
is by about 1.1 and 1.6 eV larger than that reported by Jiang
et al. [47] and Andersson et al. [54], respectively, for an
oxygen defect concentration eight times smaller (cf. Table 9).
The E
1
2 O2
f
values in Refs. [46,47] and [54] were obtained
with the same computational technique (i.e., working with the
same code [157]) and may be reﬂecting some concentration
dependence; however, to discuss such effects quantitatively,
the used methodology has to be identical (i.e., same cutoff,
equivalent k-point meshes, etc.).
As for reduced ceria surfaces (cf. Section 6.3.1), Fabris
et al. [48–50] found that using LDA and PBE the ground state
of defective ceria was metallic with the two excess electrons
left upon reduction of the Ce8O16 cell evenly distributed
among all four Ce nearest neighbors to the defect in a parallel
ordering (see Table 9). Consistently, these four atoms relaxed
symmetrically with respect to the vacany (the four Ce atoms
0.18 ˚
A outward, while the six O atoms 0.15 ˚
A inward) [48].
Hence, as previously discussed, in this geometry there are not
two neighboring CeIII ions to the oxygen defect. The metallic
character of partially reduced CeO2 with LDA and PW91 has
been once more recently reported [54].
The Hubbard-U correction to the local and gradient-
corrected functionals resulted in insulating (ferromagnetic or
antiferromagnetic) ground states, and the expected localization
of the excess electrons on two (rather than four) neighboring
Ce atoms [48–50,53,54] (see Table 9). The DFT + U solutions
exhibited a complex relaxation pattern of the defect’s nearest
and next-nearest neighbors with the relaxed structure being
relatively insensitive to the details of the functionals (LDA + U
or PBE+U) [48]. For instance, the CeIII and CeIV atoms around
the defect in a (2 × 1 × 1) cell moved outward by 0.11 and 0.17
˚
A, respectively. Five O atoms relaxed inward (four by 0.12 ˚
A,
one by 0.25 ˚
A), and one outward by less than 0.03 ˚
A. All other
atoms in the supercell relaxed by less than 0.05 ˚
A [48]. This
is a renewed demonstration of the importance of self-consistent
relaxation of reduced ceria using functionals that can correctly
reproduce its ground state electronic properties.
As noticed for ceria surfaces (cf. Section 6.3.2) the DFT+U
calculated bulk defect formation energy may also lie within
a wide energy range (∼4 eV) depending on the DFT + U
implementation used; manifestly this is most unsatisfactory
and undesirable (cf. Table 9). For example, the E
1
2 O2
f
values
at a defect concentration of 1/16 were 5.55 eV (PBE + U)
and 6.74 (LDA + U) with Wannier orbitals, whereas using
standard atomic orbitals values of 2.58 eV (PBE + U) and
3.45 (LDA + U) were calculated [50]. As observed above, the
effect of the type and extent of the localized functions is most
prominent, whereas that of the different underlying functional is
less striking, i.e., ∼1 eV, with the LDA + U values being larger
than the PW91 + U values with the same projector functions.
As for the previously discussed DFT (i.e., without U′)
results, the difference between the DFT + U defect formation
energies corresponding to different unit cell sizes may feature
some dependence on the defect concentration. For example,
from the LDA + U values with projectors based on atomic
orbitals in Table 9, one sees that the value of 3.45 eV (U ′ = 5.3
eV) [50] with the Ce8O16 cell is by 1.1 eV larger compared
to that (2.35 eV) calculated at a four times lower defect
concentration (U′ = 6.3 eV) [47]. However, the recent LDA+U
value of 3.61 eV (U ′ = 6.0 eV) [54] would indicate the increase
in E
1
2 O2
f
as the vacancy concentration decreases.
Similarly, the PBE + U (U ′ = 4.5 eV) [50] value of 2.58
eV with the Ce8O16 cell is by about 0.3 and 0.8 eV smaller
compared to the PW91 + U (U ′ = 5.0 eV) values of 2.88
and 3.39 eV with the four times larger cell (Ce32O64) [53,54].
These ambiguities are in part due to the different U ′ values and
are problems that must be lived with until a better DFT + U
prescription is formulated. Thus, from the data in Table 9, it
is too early to draw a deﬁnite conclusion about the converged
energy value to form an isolated oxygen defect in bulk CeO2.
We note that defects are found to be more stable at the surfaces
than in the bulk with DFT+U, consistent with the PW91 results
of Yang et al. [46].
Experimental values of the heat of reduction per oxygen va-
cancy determined by thermogravimetry, electrical conductivity,
and calorimetry, are in the 3.94–4.67 eV range [298]. The re-
sults obtained with GGA functionals lie more or less within the
260
M.V. Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. / Surface Science Reports 62 (2007) 219–270
experimental range. In all likelihood, this is related to a fortu-
itous cancellation of errors, and not related to a proper descrip-
tion of the underlying physical properties of reduced ceria.
6.5. Summary CeO2
Theoretical studies on reduced ceria systems are very
recent and as a whole they do not constitute a systematic
and conclusive database, in particular as far as the formation
energy of the isolated neutral oxygen defect is concerned.
Nevertheless, the following picture emerged: The main effect of
the removal of lattice oxygen atoms from ceria is the important
change in the nature of the f electrons, namely from valence to
core-like. A theoretical approach that would correctly describe
both situations has to take proper account of the strong on-site
f–f interactions that push the f electrons towards localization.
In particular, the formally two electrons left in the system
upon formation of a neutral oxygen defect drive the CeIV →
CeIII reduction of two nearest neighbor cerium atoms of the
defect. Using the GGA (but also LDA), the resulting electronic
structure of reduced ceria systems is simply wrong. The ground
state is metallic and the excess electrons are evenly shared by all
cerium atoms; not even a perceivable indication of the existence
of occupied states that “would like to split” from the bottom of
the conduction band is to be seen. The use of periodic DFT+U
approaches (independent of the particular implementation) that
take explicit account of electron interactions in the narrow f
band, yields the expected insulating state and localization of
the excess electrons. These results have been corroborated by
MP2 cluster studies (i.e., by the simplest explicit treatment
of electron correlations). Hybrid functionals, which include a
portion of exact exchange, have not yet been used in (periodic
or cluster) studies on partly reduced ceria, but would be most
desirable.
The geometrical and electronic structures of reduced ceria
systems have to be calculated self-consistently employing a
method that is able to properly describe the electronic structure,
i.e., plain LDA or GGA cannot be applied. The latter yield
a locally symmetric environment of oxygen defects which is
inconsistent with the locally distorted environment produced
by the existence of neighboring CeIV and CeIII ions. Yet, the
amplitude of the displacements is fairly small (less than 0.2 ˚
A).
The two localized f electrons (per oxygen defect) on nearest
neighbor Ce atoms to the defect in reduced ceria systems have
been found (DFT + U) to be antiferromagnetically coupled
in some systems, but ferromagnetically coupled in others; the
answer to the magnetic ground state may vary depending on
the DFT + U implementation. The energy difference between
the triplet and closed-shell singlet states is estimated to be less
than 0.1 eV. As for the isolated defect formation energy, the
DFT + U results are not ﬁnal. Values depend signiﬁcantly on
the speciﬁc implementation, in particular, the nature and extent
of the localized f orbitals deﬁning the projection operators, the
underlying level of theory (LDA or GGA), and the actual value
of the effective Coulomb parameter U ′. From the reviewed
theoretical studies we gather that for reduced ceria surfaces,
one may not even be able to obtain reliable energy differences,
which is particularly discouraging. Speciﬁcally, the relative
stability of surface and subsurface defects at the CeO2(111)
surface depend on the choice of the functional; while GGA+U
favors subsurface sites (Θdef = 1/4), LDA + U favors sites at
the surface leading to better agreement with experiments.
7. Similarities and differences between TiO2, ZrO2, V2O5,
and CeO2
Table 10 summarizes the main structural and electronic
properties as well as energetic quantities related to the
formation of isolated oxygen defects in TiO2, ZrO2, V2O5,
and CeO2, as examples of reduced TM and RE oxides, and the
ability of state-of-the-art methods to describe them.
From comparison of experimental data and those in Tables 1
and 3–9, we conclude that oxygen defects in TiO2 (rutile
and anatase) and V2O5 systems belong to the same class:
The excess electrons occupy d states ∼1 eV below the
conduction band in the band gap, and lattice relaxations are
sizable. In V2O5 in particular (we considered the V2O5(001)
surface), removal of a vanadyl oxygen atom results in large
displacements and the formation a V–O–V bond between the
weakly interacting layers. As far as the electronic structure
is concerned, the two electrons left at the V2O5(001) surface
localize (after relaxation) at the V sites forming the interlayer
bond (one electron at each V), driving the VV
→
VIV
reduction. In TiO2, upon formation of a bridging oxygen defect
at the rutile TiO2(110) surface in particular, the excess electrons
occupy Ti 3d states localized at two Ti atoms close to the defect
(but not necessarily both nearest neighbors).
In reduced ZrO2, the two electrons occupy a state ∼2.6
eV above the valence band in the band gap. The state is
formed (mainly) by a linear combination of d orbitals on
nearest neighboring Zr atoms, but the charge is for the most
part localized at the vacant site. With the large band gap, the
little relaxation upon reduction, and the “trapped” electrons,
the oxygen defects in ZrO2 resemble the F-centers in the ionic
oxide MgO. Thus, they are different from those of TiO2 and
V2O5.
CeO2 with empty f-states in the ≈6 eV wide O 2p–Ce 5d
band gap belongs to yet another class than the TiO2, ZrO2,
and V2O5 TMs with O 2p–M d band gaps (M = Ti, Zr, and
V). After the creation of oxygen defects, the excess electrons
populate f states that split from the conduction band (its bottom
now formed by Ce 5d4f states), forming an extremely narrow
band which leads to localized electrons in atomic-like orbitals
of neighboring Ce sites to the defect. Lattice relaxations are
distinct, but small.
When may we expect the excess electrons to remain at
the oxygen vacant site of TM oxides as it is described in
ionic oxides such as MgO? In order to answer this question
qualitatively, we consider the Madelung potential at the oxygen
sites (that become vacant) in bulk TiO2 (rutile/anatase), t-
ZrO2, and V2O5 and compare to MgO. The results are listed
in Table 11, as obtained from the Ewald summation assuming
formal charges (Vform), as well as those resulting from self-
consistent PW91 calculations (VPW91) performed for this

In V2O5 and t-ZrO2, this oxygen atom is the vanadyl O(1) and the O(4) atom, respectively (cf. Figs. 11 and 17). The Madelung potentials are obtained using formal
charges, Vform, and self-consistent charges on the metal atoms, VPW91; corresponding charges of the metal atoms in the second and fourth columns (see text).
review using the VASP code [157] (PAW potentials and 400
eV cutoff); these are site-projected DOS (onto non-overlapping
spheres), integrated up to the Fermi level. Lattice constants
were optimized.
The absolute values of VPW91 follow the V2O5 < TiO2 < t-
ZrO2 < MgO trend. The difference between the self-consistent
and formal charges and that between VPW91 and Vform is
smallest for the highly ionic MgO (followed by t-ZrO2). This
indicates that the TM oxides are characterized by signiﬁcant
covalent bonding. Ionic solids with large lattice enthalpies,
reﬂecting large Madelung energies, have large band gaps (cf.
observed band gaps: MgO, 7.8 eV; t-ZrO2, 5.8–6.6 eV; TiO2,
3.0/3.2 eV (rutile/anatase); V2O5, 2.3 eV). For all three TM
oxides (and MgO), population of states in the band gap upon
reduction has been observed.
As in MgO, the attractive Madelung potential in t-ZrO2 is
sufﬁciently strong to stabilize the excess electrons at the vacant
site. However, this is not the case in TiO2 and V2O5, and
therefore the electrons are expected not to be trapped at the
vacant site but localized at cation sites formerly neighboring
the oxygen removed. The effect of lattice relaxation is
not considered in these simple arguments. This qualitative
considerations apply to the reduction of insulating simple and
TM oxides with fairly sizable band gaps (formed predominantly
by the oxygen p and the metal d states); they are not suitable for
RE oxides such as CeO2, where other mechanisms related to
the localization of f electrons in nearly core-like orbitals upon
oxygen removal apply.
The defect formation energies in the TM oxides follow the
V2O5 < TiO2 (rutile) < TiO2 (anatase) < t-ZrO2 trend
(cf. Table 10). To rationalize this trend, we calculated E

for the example of defects in the bulk, employing V24O60,
Ti90O180 (rutile), Ti32O64 (anatase), and Zr54O108 (t-ZrO2)
unit cells with PW91. The corresponding E

equals
6.95 eV [70]. The trend is roughly linear for both relaxed
and unrelaxed structures. In the following, we qualitatively
discuss the observed trends, however, keeping in mind that
these numbers might not correspond to the isolated defect limit
and that size effects can vary from one system to the other.
In V2O5 lattice relaxations facilitate reduction enormously;
they become less important as the Madelung potential becomes
more attractive (i.e., the system more ionic). Note that

(relaxed) structures.
relaxations are larger for the rutile than for the anatase phase,
the latter being more difﬁcult to reduce, however the Madelung
potential at oxygen sites in the two TiO2 phases is very similar.
It is found that the Madelung potential (which correlates
with the band gap), in a way “controls” the defect properties,
namely the less attractive the potential, the smaller the band gap
(the larger the relaxations), the less likely trapped electrons will
be found at the vacant site, and the smaller the defect formation
energy. In turn, the challenge for local and gradient-corrected
functionals increases as band gaps narrow.
The existence of occupied states in the gap of TMs is
not reproduced with local and gradient-corrected functionals
for the narrow-gap materials, namely, TiO2 and V2O5 (see
Fig. 27). Band gaps are actually narrower according to gradient-
corrected DFT (cf. calculated PW91 band gaps: MgO, 4.5 eV; t-
ZrO2, 3.9 eV; TiO2, 1.8/2.1 eV (rutile/anatase); V2O5, 2.0 eV),
and defect states are not split from the conduction band. This
is in contrast to t-ZrO2 (and MgO) for which defect states are
qualitatively well described with functionals that do not contain
Fock exchange, i.e., the GGA deﬁciencies are less critical
for wide-gap (5–15 eV) systems. The well-known signiﬁcant
overestimation of electron delocalization and metallic character
by these functionals render the description of the electronic
structure of reduced narrow-gap systems inaccurate. The extent
to which the excess electrons are found to spread, however,
varies. Nonetheless, one can safely state that gradient-corrected

whereas is closed-shell singlet for TiO2 (rutile and anatase) and ZrO2. The
DOS of the defect free cell is shown as a reference (black). The majority spin-
component (α-spin) is shown in every case. The energy zero is set to the top
of the O 2p band. The curves are smoothed by a Gaussian level broadening

functionals give too delocalized excess-electrons, but describe
the signiﬁcant defect induced relaxations moderately well.
These inherent problems to local and GGA functionals peak
for reduced ceria, leading to the complete failure of the method
to describe reduced ceria’s electronic structure and geometry.
The predicted delocalization of charge (that reduces
Coulomb repulsion because local and gradient-corrected
functionals are not free of the self-interaction energy) can be
corrected using hybrid functionals within DFT. As applied to
reduced titania (periodic and cluster) and vanadia (cluster),
they properly describe the charge localization at nearby cation
sites, and the existence of occupied states in the band gaps.
In addition, hybrid functionals yield improved band gaps. No
hybrid functional study on defective ceria has been reported,
but DFT + U and MP2. The latter are also found to improve
results over (plain) DFT.
Turning to the accuracy of the calculated defect formation
energies, the use of hybrid approaches should reduce the
characteristic overbinding of gradient-corrected functionals,
for all systems. For instance, cluster (B3LYP) studies on the
V2O5(001) and TiO2(110) surfaces yielded a reduction of about
0.7 and 0.3 eV, respectively. The latter is expected to increase
after the proper inclusion of structure relaxation. No hybrid
numbers exist for ZrO2 (that are reliable) and CeO2 (at all).
Those obtained with DFT+U for CeO2 lack predictability, and
those with MP2 corresponded to a somewhat restrictive cluster
model. One point that cannot be emphasized strongly enough is
validation of the models, (embedded) clusters in particularly.
First perform a calculation using GGA and compare to
either bigger clusters or periodic results, then perform cluster
studies that include Fock exchange. An example is the (fully
self-consistent) V2O5 cluster study using GGA and B3LYP
functionals. Thus, the question for a converged surface (and
bulk) defect formation energy for TiO2, ZrO2, and CeO2
remained mostly unanswered, but well worth further research
and study.
8. Summary and outlook
The ﬁeld of the theoretical characterization of oxygen
defects in TM and RE oxides has reached a state of maturity in
recent years. Getting more accurate defect formation energies
and a more reliable distribution of the excess electrons requires
going beyond the GGA in DFT, using hybrid approaches, for
example. In general that means increasing the computational
demands. Thus, the choice of the model of the reduced system
may become crucial. Will the widely used periodic models
be useful in this respect? Very recent work on the electronic
structure of defective TiO2(110) surfaces using periodic models
and hybrid functionals [23,25] indicates that we can expect an
increased interest in this type of calculation in the near future.
Yet, cluster approaches will still be useful (and less costly
computationally). Nonetheless, a universal hybrid functional
that includes a ﬁxed amount of exact exchange might not
necessarily be able to describe the electronic structure (and
magnetic properties) of all (different) TM and RE oxides with
the same accuracy.
Some theoretical approaches have been applied to reduced
TM and RE oxides that produce some improvements over
GGA such as DFT + U and the self-interaction-corrected
DFT (see Refs. [294,299–301]) and are less challenging
computationally compared to hybrid methods. These methods
do cure GGA shortcomings such as the predicted metallicity of
actual insulating (reduced) TM and RE oxides and signiﬁcantly
improve the underestimation of band gaps. Yet, further
development is necessary to obtain reliable energies, i.e., the
quest for improved functionals is still open.
Once a more accurate description of the surface electronic
structure has been reached, the next logical step would be to
re-inspect results of surface chemistry studies on TM and RE
oxides, e.g., on the binding of selected adsorbates on reduced
surfaces and the nature of reaction intermediates on easily
reducible oxides. We think that there is room for surprises
considering that the surface chemistry of TM and RE oxides
is often defect-driven.
Also, the experimental know-how in the ﬁeld is growing.
It is only recently that atomic-resolution imaging using STM
has gained the capability to characterize defect structures and
defect mobility, and with scanning tunnel spectroscopy new
possibilities emerge. Joint efforts are likely to improve our
current knowledge of the defects related properties and their
inﬂuence on the chemical and physical behavior of TM and RE
oxides systems.
