Linear free energy relationships for the decomposition of formate and methoxide inter- 
mediates on metal surfaces have been developed. These demonstrate that Group VIII and 
Group IB metals do not obey the same correlations. Implications of these observations 
include the potential for misinterpretation of classical Balandin "volcano" plots. 
Keywords: Transition metal catalysts, formic acid, methanol, linear free energy relationships 
The decomposition of formic acid has long been a common test reaction for 
examining the activity of metal catalysts. The variation of the activity of transi- 
tion metals for this reaction forms the basis for perhaps the best known example 
of a "Balandin volcano curve" illustrating Sabatier's principle of the optimum 
instability of catalytic intermediates [1]. This reaction proceeds via a surface 
formate intermediate; these species are ubiquitous in studies of formic acid 
adsorption on metal single crystals. Platinum is the most active metal for formic 
acid decomposition; on metals where the enthalpy of formation of the formate is 
more negative, the formate is more stable and the steady state rate is lower; on 
Ag and Au decomposition is slower due to less favorable thermodynamics and 
kinetics of formate formation. If one considers only the thermal stability of 
formates, e.g., as represented by peak temperatures in TPD experiments, one 
would expect to observe only one "leg"of the volcano; i.e., the influence of the 
rate limiting formation of formates on the noble metals would be removed. 
Madix [2,3] has suggested, however, that the rate of formate decomposition alone 
appears to exhibit "volcano" behavior; i.e., the apparent activation energy for 
formate decomposition passes through a minimum value as one examines metals 
with increasingly negative enthalpies of formation of the formate (see fig. 1). As 
depicted, this clearly does not represent a linear free energy relationship of the 
sort implicit in Sabatier's principle or in the classical explanation of the Balandin 
volcano curve. Madix [3] has suggested that formate species are more stable on 
the IB metals than on the platinum group, in spite of less favorable thermody-

namics of formation of metal-formate or metal-oxygen bonds on the IBs, because 
of the weakness of M-H bonds on the IB metals. Since formate decomposition 
on these metals occurs via cleavage of the C-H bond, a low affinity of the metal 
surface for hydrogen atoms would increase the thermodynamic and kinetic 
barriers to formate decomposition. Although this explanation is qualitatively 
correct, the "volcano" of formate stabilities is rather misleading. Fig. 2 illustrates 
a plot of formate decomposition temperatures from TPD experiments on single 
crystals [4-15] vs. the enthalpies of formation per mole of metal of the corre- 
sponding metal oxides (Tanaka-Tamaru plot). It is apparent that the IB metals do 
not represent the complementary leg of the "volcano" to the Group VIIIs; rather 
they give a parallel but separate family of points vs. the Group VIII metals. The 
two lines in fig. 2 for the peak temperatures (Tp) for formate decomposition are 
given by the equations

The ca. 10 kcal/mol offset in E 0 reflects the lower affinities of the IB metals for 
hydrogen atoms and the correspondingly higher barrier for hydrogen transfer 
from the carboxyl carbon of the formate to the metal surface. The following 
conclusions may be drawn from the correlations illustrated in fig. 2. 
1. The same linear free energy relationship cannot be applied to formate 
decomposition on the Group VIII and IB metals; in effect it is dangerous to 
generalize from the IBs to the VIIIs. This has clear implications for comparative 
activities, and as shown below, for reaction selectivities as well. It is unfortunate 
in that, as pointed out by Madix [16], many of the surface intermediates of 
interest can be synthesized most cleanly by proton transfer to preadsorbed 
oxygen atoms on the IB metals. 
2. For the simple C-H cleavage involved in formate decomposition, a single 
linear free energy relationship can be applied to describe the kinetics of formate 
decomposition on all of the Group VIII metals. Data obtained on different 
178 
M.A. Barteau / Linear free energy relationships 
crystallographic planes of a given metal suggest that the influence of surface 
structure on formate stability is minimal. Moreover, it is likely that in the absence 
of significant steric effects, whatever crystallographic influences exist on formate 
stability will also be reflected in the atom binding energies which one might 
prefer to use over bulk oxide thermodynamics. Thus a single LFER would still be 
applicable for the Group VIII metals, with little variation for different surface 
structures. This is quite consistent with the traditional view of catalysis by metals, 
which considers the activation of O-H and C-H bonds characterizing the 
decomposition of formic acid to be facile, structure-insensitive reactions [17]. 
Strikingly similar conclusions may be drawn for the decomposition of the 
simplest alcohol, methanol, on surfaces of the Group VIII and IB metals. 
HREELS and isotopic labelling experiments have shown that methanol decom- 
position proceeds by initial cleavage of the O-H bond on these metals to form 
stable methoxy (CH30) intermediates. This reaction occurs readily between 100 
and 200 K on the Group VIII metals. The IBs generally require the addition of 
oxygen atoms to the surface to facilitate methoxy formation by proton abstrac- 
tion (although this can be avoided on Cu by the use of higher adsorption 
temperatures [18]). In any case, one can form isolable CH30 species on all of 
these metals (albeit with somewhat greater difficulty than for formates) and can 
track their decomposition by HREELS, TPD, etc. Fig. 3 illustrates the "volcano" 
plot for CH30 decomposition, using literature values [18-34] for CH30 decom-

position temperatures. The similarity to the plot (fig. 2) for formate decomposi- 
tion is remarkable. Once again we see essentially two linear correlations of 
decomposition .temperature with enthalpy of formation of the metal oxide; one 
line for the Group VIII metals and one line for the IBs. Moreover the slopes of 
these lines are in excellent agreement with those of fig. 2 for formate decomposi- 
tion; those for CH30 decomposition are simply offset to lower temperature by ca. 
80 K (on the Group VIII metals). The fits to the CH30 data, corresponding to 
the analysis of formate decomposition above are 
Group VIII: 
Tp (K) -- 2.54[-AH/~ 
(kcal/mol)] + 132 
(5) 
E a (kcal/mol)= 0.157[-AHf~

(6) 
Group IB: 
Tp = 2.24[- AHf~ 
+ 261 
(7) 
ea = 0.138[-AHf~ 
+ 15.4. 
(8) 
If one considers the displacement along the x-axis required to superimpose the 
CH30 and HCOO decomposition temperatures for the Group VIII metals, one 
obtains an offset of 33 kcal/mol in the value of Z~H/M 
o used as a correlating 
parameter. This represents essentially the difference in the enthalpy of formation 
of HCOO ~ VS. CH30 ", which can be determined from thermochemical data [35] 
to be 31.6 kcal/mol. Although this is an oversimplification since we have 
considered neither actual A 
Hf data for metal formates and methoxides, nor the 
product distribution from the decomposition of these species, this difference 
suggests that the difference in formate and methoxide stabilities results essentially 
from the shallower thermodynamic well characteristic of the methoxide. In effect 
the transition states for hydrogen abstraction from these two simple adsorbates 
are quite similar, and one could, in principle, construct a single linear free energy 
relationship which included both methoxides and formates, if data on the 
enthalpies of formation of each on different metals were available. 
As noted above, decomposition of methoxides on the Group IB metals requires 
a different correlation than on the Group VIIIs. As with the formates, one sees a 
lower affinity for hydrogen atoms on the part of the IB metals, and a correspond- 
ingly greater thermal stability of the organic moieties from which they might be 
abstracted. There is also a significant difference in the selectivity of CH30 
decomposition between the Group VIII and IB metals, to understand which one 
must consider the details of the sequence of C-H cleavage reactions. On the IB 
metals, the principal product of CH30 decomposition observed in TPD experi- 
ments is formaldehyde, an unsurprising result since these metals were the first 
catalysts for the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. In contrast, on 
the Group VIII metals, in the absence of surface modifiers such as sulfur or 
180

oxygen, formaldehyde is never observed in methanol TPD; dehydrogenation goes 
to completion and the sole products are CO plus H 2. The production of CO and 
H 2 suggests that methoxide decomposition proceeds via a sequence of dehydro- 
genation reactions, the first of which would produce formaldehyde on the surface. 
This has been confirmed both by experiments utilizing the kinetic isotope effect 
to demonstrate the rate determining cleavage of the methoxide C-H bond on 
Ni(111) [31], and by careful HREELS studies which have isolated adsorbed 
formaldehyde species in the course of methanol decomposition on Pd(111) [36]. 
However, in contrast to its behavior on the IB metals, this intermediate dehydro- 
genation product, formaldehyde, never leaves clean surfaces of the Group VIII 
metals intact. The reason is that formaldehyde (and carbonyl compounds in 
general) are bound differently on the two. On the IB metals, aldehydes and 
ketones bind weakly via donation of the lone pair electrons from the carbonyl 
oxygen to the metal surface in an ~a(O) configuration. On clean surfaces the 
Group VIII metals aldehydes and ketones are bound in an 7/2(C, O) configura- 
tion, with the carbonyl axis nearly parallel to the surface and with the C = O 
bond strongly rehybridized. (The red shift of 300-400 cm -1 for the v(CO) mole 
of ~/2 species relative to the free molecules is easily detected by HREELS [37]). 
These ~72-aldehydes are strongly bound to the surface and their further dehydro- 
genation is strongly favored over desorption; aldehydes are not observed as 
volatile products of alcohol dehydrogenation on the Group VIII metals. We have 
shown that on Pd(III) this strong rehybridization of the carbonyl group can be 
poisoned by the presence of electronegative surface modifiers such as oxygen 
[38,39]. In this case the bonding reverts to ~/1(O), the activation energy for 
desorption is lowered by ca. 5 kcal/mol, aldehyde desorption can compete 
kinetically with decomposition, and aldehydes are observed as volatile products. 
With respect to aldehyde binding configuration and desorption, then, electro- 
negative modifiers make the platinum group metals "look" more like their more 
noble neighbors. 
The analysis above suggests that the decomposition of methanol via methoxide 
and formaldehyde intermediates on transition metal surfaces is straightforward. 
The sequence of dehydrogenations is the same in all of the examples cited; the 
stabilities of methoxides on different metals are predicted by a simple linear free 
energy relationship. Dehydrogenation is facile and structure-insensitive as ex- 
pected. The selectivity of methanol decomposition can be understood by consid- 
eration of the nature of the interaction of the intermediate dehydrogenation 
product, formaldehyde, with different metal surfaces. However at this point it is 
worthwhile to consider the caution with which one should approach the above 
correlations, as well as the potential pitfalls they suggest in the interpretation of 
conventional "volcano" plots of catalytic rate data. 
Several recent reports [23,40-42] have suggested that methanol or methoxide 
species on platinum and palladium surfaces can react via C-O scission to 
produce adsorbed methyl groups and/or methane, rather than dehydrogenation

products. Although this reaction has proven difficult to verify on the Pd(111) 
surface [43,44] its occurrence on other surfaces cannot be ruled out. The data 
included in fig. 3 which form the basis for equations (5) and (6) do not include 
any examples of C-O scission. Therefore the above conclusions regarding 
methanol dehydrogenation may not apply to methanol deoxygenation. The latter 
reaction may not obey the same linear free energy relationship as the former; 
moreover, the C-O scission reaction may be structure sensitive, as suggested by 
Wang and Masel [23]. 
With that caveat, the LFERS depicted in figs. 2 and 3 have important 
consequences for the interpretation of the catalytic activities of different metals. 
It is clear that "volcano" plots for Group VIII metal-catalyzed reactions can be 
extended beyond these elements in a qualitative, but not quantitative fashion. 
Figs. 2 and 3 clearly show different correlations for dehydrogenation of surface 
intermediates on the Group VIII vs. the IB metals. Limited data available for 
formate and methoxide decomposition on Group VI metals [24,25,34] suggest 
that these would also fall outside the correlation for the Group VIIIs, although 
caution is required as the surfaces of early transition metals often contain 
adsorbed oxygen and carbon atoms from prior unselective decomposition of 
reactants such as formic acid or methanol. In any case, it is clear that conclusions 
regarding the facile or demanding nature [17] of metal-catalyzed reactions should 
be based upon activity variations within Group VIII, and not beyond. 
The data above suggest that one must also be careful in the explanation of 
"volcano" behavior for catalytic reactions on different metals. The conventional 
interpretation of Balandin volcano plots suggests that there is a shift in the 
rate-determining step as one crosses the peak: the rate determining step on the 
"left" slope is the formation of the surface intermediate; on the "right" slope it is 
the decomposition of that intermediate. While this interpretation is likely to be 
correct within any family of metals which exhibit volcano behavior, it may not 
hold for jumps across columns of the Periodic Table. For example, from the data 
illustrated in figs. 1 and 2, it appears that there is a shift in the rate-determining 
step for formic acid decomposition on the IB metals. The isokinetic temperatures 
for formic acid decomposition on Cu and Ag are essentially equal to the 
respective peak temperatures for formate decomposition, suggesting that this is 
the rate determining step of the catalytic reaction on these two metals under the 
conditions measured. The isokinetic temperature for formic acid decomposition 
on Au is nearly 200~ 
higher than the formate decomposition temperature, 
suggesting that formate formation is rate-determining on this metal. The 
"volcano" illustrated in fig. 1 for Group VIII + IB metals combined would lead 
one to the correct conclusion regarding the rate determining step on Au or Cu, 
but not Ag. Failure to recognize that the Group VIII and IB metals belong on 
different "volcanoes" would lead to exactly opposite strategies for catalyst 
promotion. Surface modifications (e.g., alloying) which would allow one to 
interpolate between the thermodynamic properties of adsorbates on silver and

copper would be predicted to produce a catalyst more active than either of these 
according to the volcano depicted in fig. 1, but would actually produce a 
monotonic change in activity from copper to silver if the decomposition of a 
common surface intermediate were rate determining in all cases. Again one must 
be careful to establish whether a single linear free energy relationship can be 
applied to all of the catalysts of interest for a given reaction.
