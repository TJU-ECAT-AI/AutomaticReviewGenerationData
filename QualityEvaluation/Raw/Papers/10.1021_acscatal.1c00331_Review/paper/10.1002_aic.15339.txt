This paper describes catalytic consequencesThis paper describes catalytic consequences of Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts pro-
moted with Ga species for propane dehydrogenation. A series of PtGa/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by a sequen-
tial impregnation method. The as-prepared catalysts were characterized employing N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray
diffrtaction, temperature programmed reduction, O2 volumetric chemisorption, H2-O2 titration, and transmission elec-
tron microscopy. We have shown that Ga31 cations are incorporated into the cubic ﬂuorite structure of CeO2, enhanc-
ing both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility. The enhanced reducibility of CeO2 is indicative of
higher capability to eliminate the coke deposition and thus is beneﬁcial to the improvement of catalytic stability. Density
functional theory calculations conﬁrm that the addition of Ga is prone to improve propylene desorption and greatly sup-
press deep dehydrogenation and the following coke formation. The catalytic performance shows a strong dependence on
the content of Ga addition. The optimal loading content of Ga is 3 wt %, which results in the maximal propylene selec-
tivity together with the best catalytic stability against coke accumulation. V

Introduction
Propylene is an important feedstock employed in the pro-
duction of a vast series of chemicals such as polypropylene
and acrylonitrile.1–3 In recent years, propylene production
from conventional paths could not match its increasing
demand, thus propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has acquired
considerable attention as an alternative propylene production
technology.4,5 Pt-based catalysts supported on alumina are
widely utilized in the PDH processes.6,7 Despite their high cat-
alytic activity, supported Pt catalysts are subjected to severe
deactivation primarily due to coke formation.8–10 Furthermore,
Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory selectivity toward
desired products caused by the generation of lighter hydrocar-
bons via the C–C bond cleavage.10,11 Thus, it is of great
importance to develop effective approaches to solving the
problems of fast deactivation and low selectivity of Pt-based
catalysts.
Ceria has wide applications in numerous catalytic processes,
including CO oxidation,12 NOx reduction,13 and steam reform-
ing.14 Owing to its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC), CeO2
tends to suppress coke formation using mobile oxygen
released from the lattice to oxidize carbon deposits.13,15 Yu
et al. reported that the presence of CeO2 could resist the coke
accumulation and improve the performance of PtSn/Al2O3 for
the PDH reaction.16 According to previous studies, doping
with different types of metal ions could improve the reducibil-
ity of CeO2.17–19 Collins et al. investigated the synthesis of
Ga-Ce oxides and revealed that the Ga31 was incorporated
into the ceria lattice and subsequently the redox properties of
CeO2 were modiﬁed.20 With gallium doping, the amount of
lattice oxygen vacancies was increased and the surface oxygen
mobility (OM) was improved. Density functional theory
(DFT) calculations have also been adopted to verify the higher
OSC and OM of gallium-doped ceria and understand the redox
mechanism of CeO2.21
Recently, gallium has also been considered to be an efﬁcient
promoter in Pt-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation to
alkenes.22–25 In accordance with other metal promoters such
as Sn, Cu, Zn, Re, and Ge,26–32 the introduction of Ga results
in pronounced enhancement of dehydrogenation catalytic sta-
bility and selectivity toward desired products. On reduction at
high temperatures (e.g., 500 8C), a portion of Ga31 was
reduced to Ga atoms, which was catalyzed in the presence of
Pt. The generated Ga atoms tended to migrate and incorporate
into Pt nanoclusters, forming PtGa alloys with variable com-
positions.33 Analogous to PtSn catalysts,34,35 the inﬂuence of
PtGa alloy on the catalytic performance could be attributed to
the combination of geometric and electronic effects. The geo-
metric effect contributes to decreasing the size of Pt ensembles
or blocking the low-coordinated defect active sites by Ga
atoms, thereby attenuating the structure-sensitive side reac-
tions,
including
hydrogenolysis
and
deep
dehydrogena-
tion.36–38 The electron transfer from Ga atoms to active sites

hinders the adsorption of alkenes on active sites and conse-
quently decreases the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and
coking.24,39
In this article, CeO2-Al2O3 binary oxide was employed as
the support for Pt nanoparticles on account of its capability to
reduce coke formation. On this basis, we proposed a strategy
of doping the Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts with the Ga species to
enhance the redox property of CeO2 and modify the properties
of Pt nanoparticles simultaneously, and hence to improve the
catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH. A series of
PtGa/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the sequential
impregnation method. The as-prepared catalysts were charac-
terized employing N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction
(XRD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), O2 volu-
metric chemisorption, H2-O2 titration, and transmission elec-
tron microscopy (TEM). The catalytic performance was
investigated at atmospheric pressure and 600 8C to understand
the role of Ga on catalytic properties of CeO2-Al2O3 supported
Pt catalysts, and then the cycling tests were performed to further
evaluate the inﬂuence of Ga dopant on the catalytic stability of
PtGa/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts. Furthermore, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was conducted to quantify the carbon deposition.
DFT calculations were applied to investigate the binding strength
of intermediates on PtGa surfaces. The optimal loading of Ga
was also discussed.
Experimental and Computational Methods
Preparation of supported Pt catalysts
The PtGa/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the
sequential impregnation method. The Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeO2-
Al2O3, and PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts were also prepared employ-
ing the same method. Ce(NO3)36H2O (Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent, 99.0%) and Ga(NO3)39H2O (Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent, 99.9%) were used as precursors and dissolved in
deionized water. A c-Al2O3 support was impregnated in these
solutions at room temperature for 12 h, followed by drying at
90 8C overnight and calcination at 600 8C for 3 h. Subse-
quently, supported Pt catalysts were prepared by an incipient
wetness impregnation method. The precursor used was
H2PtCl66H2O (Tianjin Kaiyingte chemical trade, 99.9%) in
an aqueous solution. The synthesized solids were impregnated
in the H2PtCl6 solution at room temperature for 12 h. On metal
deposition, the impregnated solids were dried at 90 8C over-
night, and then calcined at 600 8C for 3 h. A series of PtGa/
CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts with different loadings were synthesized
and denoted as PtxGa/CeAl, where x is the weight ratio of Ga/
(CeO2-Al2O3). The weight loadings of Pt was held constant at
1 wt %. Furthermore, the effect of CeO2 was studied and was
ﬁxed 10 wt % in our investigation as the optimal loading.

values
between 20 and 808 by using a Rigaku C/max-2500 diffrac-
tometer employing the graphite ﬁltered Cu Ka radiation
(k 5 1.5406 A
˚ ).
Textual properties of the supports and catalysts were meas-
ured with a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 analyzer by nitrogen
adsorption at 2196 8C. The samples were outgassed at 300 8C
for 4 h before measurements. We employed the Brunauer–
Emmett–Teller (BET) method to quantify the adsorption of
nitrogen at 2196 8C, and the cumulative pore volumes and
pore sizes were obtained by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method from the desorption branches of the adsorption
isotherms.
H2-TPR experiments were carried out to analyze the reduc-
tion behavior of the catalysts using a Micromeritics AutoChem
2920 apparatus. Prior to the TPR experiment, 150 mg sample
was pretreated at 300 8C for 1 h under Ar stream (20 mL/min).
After cooling to 50 8C, The H2-TPR was performed in 10 vol
% H2/Ar (30 mL/min) with a heating rate of 10 8C/min to
800 8C and the proﬁle was recorded with a thermal conductiv-
ity detector.
O2 volumetric chemisorption was conducted at 600 8C to
evaluate the OSC and OM of PtxGa/CeAl catalysts. Prior to
heating to 600 8C, 100 mg sample was reduced with 10 vol %
H2/Ar (30 mL/min) at 500 8C for 1 h. Injection pulses of 10
vol % H2/He (0.5082 mL) up to a complete reduction of the
sample was followed by injection pulses of 10 vol % O2/Ar
(0.5082 mL) until the peaks became stable. O2 uptake was
used to calculate the OSC, which represents the total volume
of oxygen available in the catalyst.40 Subsequently, the oxy-
gen injection pulses process was repeated to characterize the
OM on the basis of the O2 reuptake. OM stands for the amount
of available surface sites for migration of oxygen in the
catalyst.41
Dispersion

studied
employing
the
hydrogen-oxygen titration method.42 For each test, 100 mg
sample was reduced with 10 vol % H2/Ar at 500 8C for 1 h,
then cooled to 50 8C, following which oxygen was admitted to
the sample by injection pulses of 10 vol % O2/He (0.5082 mL)
until the consumption peaks became stable. Subsequently, the
H2 chemisorption was carried out at the same temperature
by injection pulses of 10 vol % H2/Ar (0.5082 mL). It can be
assumed that the adsorption stoichiometry factor of Pt/H2
equals to 2/3.42,43 The metal dispersion is calculated using
the following equation:

Where VH2 is the volume of adsorbed H2 (mL), SF is the stoi-
chiometry factor, MWPt is the atomic weight of Pt (g/mol), and
WPt is the weight of supported Pt on the sample (g).
TEM was conducted to characterize the morphology of cat-
alysts using a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope at
200 kV. High angel annular dark ﬁeld-scanning transmission
electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were also
obtained for Pt particles. The fresh catalysts were prereduced
at 500 8C in a ﬂow rate of 50 mL/min of 20 vol % H2/N2 for
1 h before characterization. The samples were dispersed in
ethanol and supported on carbon-ﬁlm coated copper grids
before TEM images were recorded.
TGA (STA449F3 NETZSCH Corp.) was used to investigate
the carbon deposition of spent catalysts. The sample was pre-
heated at 80 8C for 0.5 h in N2 (50 mL/min). Then the sample
was heated to 800 8C at a rate of 10 8C/min in air (100 mL/
min).
Catalytic tests
Catalytic tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure and
600 8C in a quartz ﬁxed-bed reactor with 8 mm in inner diame-
ter and 24 cm in length. A mixture of 150 mg catalysts and
0.1 mL quartz sand with 20–40 mesh-size distribution was
loaded in the quartz tubular reactor. Prior to the test, the cata-
lysts were reduced at 500 8C in situ for 1 h in a ﬂow of 10 vol
% H2/N2. Afterwards, H2/N2 was replaced by the mixture of

C3H8 (26 vol %) and H2 (26 vol %) in N2 at a total ﬂow rate of
50 mL/min for the PDH reaction. The weight hourly space
velocity (WHSV) of propane was 10 h21. The product gas was
analyzed by an on-line GC equipped with a ﬂame ionization
detector (Chromosorb 102 column) and a thermal conductivity
detector (Al2O3 Plot column).
The recycling tests were performed to further estimate the
stability of PtxGa/CeAl catalysts. For each catalyst, three
reduction-reaction-oxidation cycles were repeated. The reduc-
tion and reaction conditions remained the same with the above
catalytic tests. The catalysts were regenerated at 500 8C for 2 h
in a ﬂow mixture of 5 vol % O2/N2 (20 mL/min) and N2
(30 mL/min).
The conversion of propane was determined from Eq. 2 and
the selectivity to product was determined from Eq. 3:

Computational models and parameters
DFT calculations were carried out with the plane-wave
based Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)44–47 at
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level in form of
the exchange-correlation functional BEEF-vdW.48 Projector
augmented wave (PAW) method was used to describe the
interaction between the atomic cores and electrons.45,49 The
valence wave functions were expanded in a plane-wave basis
with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. The geometry optimization
was converged to 0.02 eV/A
˚ .
According to the previous studies on Pt-Ga binary system
and phase diagram,50,51 we employed three surface models,
Pt(111), Pt3Ga (111), and PtGa2(111) to represent synthesized
Pt rich and Ga rich catalysts. In the case of Pt(111) and
Pt3Ga(111), the surface was cut from FCC type of bulk metal
structure. We used a (4 3 4) ﬁve-layer slab with top two
layers relaxed. A Monkhorst-Pack mesh of 5 3 5 3 1 k points
was used to sample the Brillouin zone.52 In the case of PtGa2,
we chose a CaF2 type bulk structure with Fm-3m symmetry. A
(2 3 2) eight-layer PtGa2(111) slab with Pt termination was
used in our calculation. Top three layers of the slab were
allowed to relax during optimizations. The Brillouin zone was
sampled with a 7 3 7 3 1 Monkhorst-Pack mesh.
Results
Characterization of as-prepared catalysts
Physical properties of PtxGa/CeAl catalysts are presented in
Table 1. The Ga loading of PtxGa/CeAl catalysts to be investi-
gated is in the range of 0–5 wt %. The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst has a
surface area of 221 m2/g and a pore volume of 6.8 cm3/g. The
introduction of CeO2 leads to a decline in the surface area of
the catalyst, which may be attribute to the pore blockage. On
the dispersion of 1 wt % of Ga, the surface area decreases to
124 m2/g. However, increasing the loading of Ga (e.g., 3 wt
%, 5 wt %) has a slight inﬂuence on the surface area as well as
the pore volume. The CeO2 crystallite diameters based on
CeO2 (111) plane of XRD patterns and the Scherrer equation
are exhibited in Table 1. The CeO2 particle sizes of all the
samples are in the range of 7.0–7.5 nm, showing negligible
dependence on the Ga content. The metal dispersion deter-
mined by the H2-O2 titration method and the average Pt crys-
tallite diameters determined by TEM images are also shown in
Table 1. The results point out that the addition of CeO2
increases the Pt dispersion and thus decreases the average Pt
nanoparticle diameters. However, the presence of Ga reduces
the metal dispersion of active sites, which could be caused by
the formation of PtGa alloy as well as superﬂuous Ga2O3 sup-
pressing the exposure of Pt atoms (as will be discussed later
on).24
TEM images of the reduced catalysts are shown in Figure 1
and the insets are Pt particle-size distribution. To better distin-
guish the Pt nanoparticles, HAADF-STEM micrograph of the
Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst was obtained and shown in Figure 1d.
The PtxGa/CeAl catalysts exhibit small Pt particle sizes, indi-
cating that Pt is highly dispersed on the supports, which is in
accordance with the metal dispersion results presented in
Table 1.
Diffraction patterns of as-prepared PtxGa/CeAl catalysts
are depicted in Figure 2. The diffraction peaks at 2h 5 27.28,
39.38, 45.88, and 66.88 are assigned to c-Al2O3. For the Pt/
CeAl catalyst, the peaks at 2h 5 28.78, 33.28, 47.78, and 56.58
are attributed to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) facets of the
cubic ﬂuorite structure of CeO2, respectively. With the Ga
doping, a slight shift to the lower 2h values can be observed
for the CeO2 diffraction peaks. The diffraction peaks of
CeO2(111) facet are presented in Figure 2b. The peak ascribed
to the CeO2 (111) facet shifts to 28.58, 28.48, and 28.38 for the
Pt1Ga/CeAl, Pt3Ga/CeAl, and Pt5Ga/CeAl catalysts, respec-
tively.
Because
of relative
low calcination
temperature
(600 8C), no peaks assigned to CeAlO3 (JCPDS 81-1185) was
detected. For all the PtxGa/CeAl catalysts, no diffraction
peaks of Ga were observed, revealing that Ga component is
highly dispersed or merged into the CeO2 lattice and Pt nano-
particles. In addition, no diffraction peaks of Pt were detected

either, implying that Pt is highly dispersed on the as-prepared
supports as well.
TPR proﬁles of studied catalysts are shown in Figure 3. In
general, Pt oxide is reduced at lower temperatures, <500 8C,
while CeO2 starts to become reduced at higher temperatures,
with Tmax at around 600 8C (Figure 3).39,53 Obviously, the
addition of CeO2 leads to the down shift of the ﬁrst peak of Pt
oxides from 233 8C (Pt/Al2O3) to 196 8C (Pt/CeAl), indicating
that CeO2 promotes the reduction of Pt oxides species, consist-
ent with a previous investigation by Damyanova et al.54 The
addition of Ga shifts the reduction peak of CeO2 from 620 8C
(Pt/CeAl) to lower temperatures, 596–609 8C (PtxGa/CeAl).
Moreover, the peak area dramatically increased after addition
of Ga, indicating more lattice O can be reduced from CeO2.
Quantiﬁed analysis will be done in the following OSC and
OM analysis. Meanwhile, the intensity of the ﬁrst reduction
peak of Pt oxides increases compared to the Pt/CeAl catalyst,
which could be resulted from the partial reduction of Ga2O3
near the Pt nanoparticles.55,56
The results obtained from oxygen volumetric chemisorption
experiments are listed in Table 2. It is evident that the Ga-
modiﬁed catalysts have higher OSC than Ga-free catalysts,

and the OSC increases with the content of Ga doping. It should
be noted that the Pt3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst consumes much less
oxygen, which manifests that the augment of oxygen uptake
on PtxGa/CeAl catalysts is not simply due to the oxygen con-
sumption of Ga2O3. The results suggest that the Ga addition
increases the volume of oxygen vacancies in CeO2 lattice.
Moreover, the experimental results reveal that the mobility of
oxygen on PtxGa/CeAl catalysts is continuously intensiﬁed as
the Ga loading increases.
Catalytic performance
Results of the catalytic performance of the catalysts are
shown in Figure 4. The Pt/Al2O3 and Pt3Ga/Al2O3 catalysts
were also tested for comparison. The initial propane conver-
sions for Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeAl, Pt3Ga/Al2O3, and Pt3Ga/CeAl
catalysts are 45.5%, 47.1%, 39.4%, and 41.1%; after 15 h of
time on stream, the conversions decrease to 19.2%, 22.2%,

Al2O3 catalyst results in the slight rise of the initial propane
conversion, which is attributed to the higher dispersion of Pt
nanoparticles on the Pt/CeAl catalyst.16 Due to high surface
oxygen mobility of CeO2, the deactivation rate of the Pt/CeAl
catalyst is lower than that of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. However,
the addition of CeO2 has a negligible inﬂuence on the selectiv-
ity toward propylene. With respect to the Pt3Ga/Al2O3 cata-
lyst, an increased propylene selectivity of the catalyst was
observed throughout the course of reaction. After 15 h on
stream, the propylene selectivity for Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeAl,
Pt3Ga/Al2O3, and Pt3Ga/CeAl catalysts are 81.8%, 86.0%,
99.5%, and 99.6%, respectively. Notably, the selectivities
toward light hydrocarbons (mainly methane and ethane)
decline severely with the doping of Ga, which means that the
Ga addition suppresses cracking reactions effectively. Addi-
tionally, the Pt3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst displays better catalytic sta-
bility, which is in accordance with previous studies.22,23 For
the Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst, the best catalytic stability is pre-
sented together with the highest propylene selectivity.
The effect of Ga loading on the catalytic performance in
PDH is illustrated in Figure 5. The content of Ga addition is in
the range of 1–5 wt %. The initial conversions for Pt1Ga/
CeAl, Pt3Ga/CeAl, and Pt5Ga/CeAl catalysts are 40.9%,
41.1%, and 39.0%; after 15 h of time on stream, the

conversions of propane decrease to 23.5%, 32.2%, and 28.1%,
respectively. The Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst exhibits the lowest
deactivation rate. Additionally, the selectivity toward propyl-
ene increases with the Ga loading until the Ga content
increases to 3 wt %. The Pt3Ga/CeAl and Pt5Ga/CeAl cata-
lysts display almost the same propylene selectivity, reaching a
value of nearly 99%. Apparently, the optimal loading content
of Ga is determined to be 3 wt %, which results in high activ-
ity, excellent selectivity and the best catalytic stability.
To further conﬁrm the stability of PtxGa/CeAl catalysts, the
recycling tests were performed. For each cycle, the reduction-
reaction-oxidation processes were included to regenerate the
catalysts. Figure 6 shows the effect of regeneration cycles on
the yield and selectivity of propylene during PDH. For all the
catalysts studied, the propylene selectivity does not change
noticeably through three cycles, which means that the selectiv-
ity presents negligible dependence on the regeneration cycles.
In the ﬁrst cycle, the Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeAl, and Pt3Ga/CeAl show
the decrease in propylene yield from 30.9% to 24.7%, from
31.7% to 25.1%, and from 41.5% to 34.7%, respectively. In
the third cycle, the initial yields for Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeAl are
27.9% and 31.2%; and the ﬁnal yields drop to 22.2% and
23.3%, respectively. The loss of activity between the ﬁrst
cycle and the third cycle is considerable, in particular over the
Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. In comparison, the Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst
exhibits almost the same yield between the ﬁrst and third

while the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst suffers from the most severe
deactivation.
Characterization of spent catalysts
TEM images of spent catalysts are illustrated in Figure 7.
Apparently, the Pt particle sizes undergo negligible change on
the catalytic reaction, indicating that metal sintering takes lit-
tle responsibility for the loss of the catalytic activity. The sub-
stances with nonuniform structure depicted in the images
(inside the dotted circles), which show evidently different
morphologies from the catalysts, can be ascribed to coke
deposits. The disordered structure of the coke deposits is
assigned to the amorphous coke. It is safely concluded that
coke accumulation is the main reason for catalyst deactivation
in PDH. Figure 7 shows that the coke deposits can physically
cover the Pt surface, resulting in lower availability of active
sites and thus catalyst deactivation.
The amount of coke deposits was quantitatively determined
by TGA in an oxidizing environment, and the mass loss pro-
ﬁles and the amount of coke depositions are presented in Fig-
ure 8. It can be seen that the amount of coke deposition (mg/
(gcat.h)) follows the order Pt3Ga/CeAl (0.41) < Pt3Ga/Al2O3
(0.73) < Pt/CeAl (0.98) < Pt/Al2O3 (1.12). The addition of
CeO2 and/or Ga contributes to lower amount of coke deposits.
The lowest amount of coke deposits was observed over the
Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst. Figure 8 shows that the mass loss over
used Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst is distinctly lower than spent Pt3Ga/
Al2O3 and Pt/CeAl catalysts, which is related to the catalytic
stability.
DFT simulation results
The structures of three PtxGay surface models are shown in
Figure 9. According to previous studies on the hydrocarbon
decomposition over Pt(111), the precursors for C–C bond
breaking are highly dehydrogenated intermediates.34,57 Thus,
we only consider a scenario including initial dehydrogenation
reactions until C3H4 was formed. We also exclude hydrogena-
tion shift reactions in our reaction network, since it has been
reported with a relatively higher barrier compared to dehydro-
genation steps.58
The simulation results show that the existence of Ga in the
alloy system signiﬁcantly weakens the binding strength of sur-
face intermediates. For example, the binding energy of pro-
pene on Pt(111), Pt3Ga(111), and PtGa2(111) are 21.09,
20.83, and 20.51 eV, respectively. Thus, Ga rich surfaces are
more favorable for the desorption of the desired product pro-
pene. More importantly, the dehydrogenation steps become
more endothermic along with the increasing of Ga content in
the alloy, as shown in Figure 9b and Table 3, due to the less
favored adsorption of surface intermediate. On Pt(111), dehy-
drogenation of propane to C3H4 is endothermic by 1.13 eV.
This
transformation
is
slightly
more
endothermic
on
Pt3Ga(111), at 1.35 eV. However, it requires about 3 eV to
dehydrogenate the same amount of H atoms on PtGa2(111),
indicating that deep dehydrogenation, as well as the following
coke formation, will be highly suppressed on PtGa2(111) com-
pared to that on Pt dominated alloys surfaces.
Discussion
The effect of Ga doping on ceria
Doping metal cations into ceria is considered to be an effec-
tive way to regulate the structural and chemical properties of
pure ceria. As clearly shown in Figure 2, a slight shift to the
lower 2h values can be observed for the CeO2 diffraction
peaks with the Ga doping, suggesting that Ga31 cations are
incorporated into the host lattice structure of CeO2.20
Doping metal cations into ceria can modify the OSC and
OM of the catalysts. The modiﬁcation arises from the drop-
ping of the barrier for oxygen migration and the lowering of
the activation energy of ceria reduction.59 Extra oxygen
vacancies are formed when metal cations are incorporated into
CeO2
lattice.

chemisorption experiments, it is apparent that Ga-modiﬁed
catalysts have larger OSC than the corresponding Pt/CeAl cat-
alyst, and the OM is enhanced simultaneously. Additionally,
the OSC and OM increase with the Ga content when it is in
the range of 1–5 wt %, which is consistent with the previous
studies.21 It is implied that the Ga31 cations incorporated into
CeO2 lattice create additional oxygen vacancies and improve
the reducibility of CeO2. H2-TPR proﬁles also show that the
Ga addition facilitates the reduction from Ce41 to Ce31.
Higher OSC contributes to remove the coke deposits covered
on catalysts. An increased number of lattice oxygen tends to
consume more carbon deposition. Therefore, the enhanced
OSC is beneﬁcial to attenuate the accumulation of coke forma-
tion, and thus afford more effective exposure of active sites
which improves the catalytic stability against coke formation.
The catalytic performance of Pt/CeAl and PtGa/Al2O3 cata-
lysts are superior to that of the corresponding Pt/Al2O3 cata-
lyst. As depicted in Figure 4, the CeO2 component has a
negligible inﬂuence on the selectivity toward propylene over
the Pt/CeAl catalyst. Hence, the effect of CeO2 addition to Pt/
Al2O3 catalyst is only the improvement of initial conversion
and elimination of coke formation. Liu et al. proposed that the
Ce41 ions on the CeO2 surface can oxidize the coke formed
while being reduced to Ce31.60 Laosiripojana et al. suggested
that the strengthened redox property of doped CeO2 sup-
pressed coke formation by oxidizing the hydrocarbons on
metal surface and then contributed to the higher catalytic sta-
bility.61 Concerning the increase of initial propane conversion,
it is attributed to the higher dispersion of active sites caused
by CeO2 addition, which is shown in Table 1.
Compared with the Pt/CeAl and PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts, the
catalytic performances of Pt3Ga/CeAl are even more pro-
nounced. In addition to the formation of PtGa alloys, the Ga31
ions can be incorporated into CeO2 lattice and thus enhance
the OSC and OM of CeO2. Enhanced reducibility of CeO2 is
indicative of higher ability to suppress coke accumulation on
catalysts. The OSC and OM results reveal that the doping of
Ga enhances the redox properties of catalysts via its incorpora-
tion into the CeO2 lattice.18 The Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst exhibits
much higher OSC together with OM than Pt/CeAl and PtGa/
Al2O3 catalysts, which coincides with the TGA results that
much lower coke deposits are obtained over the used Pt3Ga/
CeAl catalyst. The amount of coke deposits on catalysts is in
accordance with the catalytic stability. Note that the addition
of CeO2 have negligible inﬂuence to the Pt:Ga ratio, 1:1 mol
ratio, in the alloy particles as indicated by TEM/EDX experi-
ment (Figure 10). It further suggests that enhanced perform-
ance is attributed to the lattice oxygen in ceria.
The effect of Ga doping on Pt particles
In comparison to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the selectivities
toward light hydrocarbons (mainly methane and ethane)
decrease severely over the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst, meaning that
the Ga addition suppresses cracking reactions effectively. Fur-
thermore, the Ga addition markedly reduces the deactivation
rate of catalyst and hence enhances the catalytic stability. The
prominent impact of Ga addition is primarily attributed to the
formation of PtGa alloys. On reduction at high temperatures
(e.g., 500 8C), a small portion of Ga31, e.g., 12% for Pt3Ga/
CeAl estimated according to TEM/EDX (Figure 10), is
reduced to form Ga atoms in contact with Pt. The generated
Ga atoms tend to migrate and incorporate into Pt nanoclusters,
forming PtGa alloy with variable compositions (1:1 in case of
Pt3Ga/CeAl, Figure 10), which has been reported in earlier
studies on Pt/Ga2O3/Al2O3 and Pt/Ga2O3 catalysts.33,62 It
should be noted that the presence of supported Pt particles is
indispensable to the reduction of Ga31, since Pt atoms cata-
lyze the reduction of Ga31 by greatly decreasing its reduction
temperature.55,63
Similar to Pt-Sn catalysts,34,35 the inﬂuence of forming
PtGa alloy on the catalytic performance could be attributed to
a combination of geometric and electronic effects of metal
promoter. Regarding the geometric effect of metal promoter,
there are two kinds of explanations. Some researchers believe
that the formation of alloy causes the decrease in the size of Pt
ensemble. For example, Bell et al. found that the Pt–Pt coordi-
nation decreased to 5.2 via EXAFS after reducing Ga modiﬁed
Pt/Mg(Al)O with H2 at 873 K, and the Pt–Pt coordination was
changed to 4.4 from 7.7 after Sn addition similarly.10,22 Stud-
ies showed that the small Pt ensemble contributes to the sup-
pression
of
structure-sensitive
side
reactions,
including
hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation.34–36,64 Indeed,
deeper dehydrogenated intermediate requires more Pt atoms to
bind due to the highly unsaturated nature of its C atoms.58 As
illustrated in the DFT study, on PtGa2(111), the lack of three-
fold Pt hollow site forced CHCHCH3 binding on top of a sin-
gle Pt atom, resulting in a 1.16 eV weaker binding than that on
the FCC site of Pt(111). Other authors insist that the hydroge-
nolysis
and deep dehydrogenation reactions, which
are
structure-sensitive, are boosted by low-coordinated defect sites
(e.g., edges and corners).37,65 The recession of these structure-
sensitive side reactions is attributed to the selective blocking
of these defect sites by Ga atoms.37,38 Both of these two geo-
metric effects caused by the formation of PtGa alloys are able
to attenuate the hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation
reactions, and consequently reduce the production of lighter
hydrocarbons (mainly methane and ethane) and inhibit the
accumulation of coke deposits.
By contrast, the electronic effect is quite straightforward.
The electronic effect of the promoter is to lower the desorption
barrier of alkene and coke precursors by donating electron to
Pt atoms.66,67 As shown in Figure 9, the binding of surface
intermediates becomes weaker along with the increase of Ga
content in the alloy. The electron transfer from promoters to
active sites hinders alkene adsorption on Pt sites and accord-
ingly
decreases
the
likelihood
of
hydrogenolysis

coking.24,39 The enhanced electron density of Pt particle pro-
motes the desorption of C3H6 and thus suppresses the deep
dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions which produce
lighter hydrocarbons and trigger a low propylene selectivity.
Furthermore, the electron-rich Pt atoms weaken the interaction
between Pt and coke precursors and facilitate the desorption
and migration of coke precursors, ﬁnally improving the cata-
lytic stability against coke deposits dramatically.29,68
The effect of Ga loadings
The PtxGa/CeAl catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic stabil-
ity against coke accumulation and superior selectivity toward
propylene. The catalytic performance of PtxGa/CeAl catalysts
can be tuned by varying the amount of Ga loading. As shown
in Figure 5, the optimal loading content of Ga is determined to
be 3 wt %. The Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst exhibits the maximal pro-
pane conversion and propylene selectivity together with the
best catalytic stability. The effect of Ga addition consists of
two aspects: decorating Pt nanoparticles via the formation of
PtGa alloys and enhancing the redox property of CeO2 via the
incorporation of Ga31 into CeO2 lattice. Both types of Ga
effects depends on the ratio of Ga to Pt or CeO2.21,23 For the
Pt1Ga/CeAl catalyst, the amount of Ga addition is not sufﬁ-
cient so that not only the composition of PtGa alloy is not opti-
mal but the OSC and OM of Ga-modiﬁed CeO2 are not
satisfactory. This accounts for the low catalytic stability and
poor propylene selectivity over Pt1Ga/CeAl catalyst shown in
Figure 5. With respect to the Pt5Ga/CeAl catalyst, excessive
Ga loading guarantees the excellent redox properties of Ga-
modiﬁed CeO2 (highest OSC and OM), although the ratio of
Ga to Pt exceeds the ideal value, leading to excessive Ga
atoms blocking the Pt active sites.23 Therefore, the decreased
initial activity is obtained over the Pt5Ga/CeAl catalyst. Con-
cerning the Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst, the OSC and OM of the cata-
lyst
are
fairly
high
to
suppress
coke
accumulation.
Conversely, the Ga/Pt ratio reach its optimal value.
A schematic model of the PtxGa/CeAl catalyst and the
mechanism of PDH catalytic reaction is proposed (Scheme 1).
As shown in Scheme 1, a portion of the Ga31 is reduced to
form Ga atoms after reduction at 500 8C, and then the gener-
ated Ga atoms migrate and incorporate into Pt nanoclusters,
forming PtGa alloy. The PtGa alloy can improve the catalytic
performance owing to a combination of geometric and elec-
tronic effects of Ga component, which ﬁnally suppress the
hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, and coking reactions.
Simultaneously, the Ga31 cations are incorporated into the lat-
tice structure of CeO2, enhancing the redox property of CeO2,
including the higher OSC and OM. The CeO2 can oxidize the
coke formed, resulting in the enhancement of catalytic stabil-
ity. Therefore, the enhanced reducibility of CeO2 with Ga dop-
ing is beneﬁcial to eliminate the coke deposition covered on
active
sites
and

area.

Conclusions
We have presented an investigation into doping the Pt/
CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts with Ga element to simultaneously
enhance the redox property of CeO2 and modify the catalytic
property of Pt nanoparticles. The addition of Ga improves the
catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH, including
increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing the catalytic
stability. According to XRD results, Ga31 cations are incorpo-
rated into the host lattice structure of CeO2. The OSC and OM
results reveal that the doping of Ga enhances the redox prop-
erty of catalysts. The enhanced reducibility of CeO2 is indica-
tive of higher capability to eliminate the coke deposition and
thus is beneﬁcial to the improvement of catalytic stability.
Simultaneously, the addition of Ga is prone to decorate Pt
nanoparticles via the formation of PtGa alloys. The inﬂuence
of forming PtGa alloys on the catalytic performance can be
attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects.
The geometric effect of metal promoter contributes to decreas-
ing the size of Pt ensembles or blocking the low-coordinated
defect active sites and thereby suppressing the structure-
sensitive side reactions, including hydrogenolysis and deep
dehydrogenation. The electronic effect of promoter is to lower
the desorption barrier of alkenes and coke precursors by donat-
ing electron to Pt atoms, hindering alkenes adsorption on
metal sites and consequently decreasing the likelihood of
hydrogenolysis and coking.
The OSC and OM increase with the Ga content when it is in
the range of 1–5 wt %, while the Ga content imposes different
impacts on the catalytic stability. With the addition of 1 wt %
Ga, both the composition of PtGa alloy and the reducibility of
Ga-modiﬁed CeO2 are not satisfactory, which accounts for the
low catalytic stability and poor propylene selectivity over the
Pt1Ga/CeAl catalyst. With excessive Ga addition (e.g., 5 wt
%), the ratio of Ga/Pt exceeds the ideal value, which leads to
superﬂuous Ga atoms blocking the Pt active sites gradually.
Therefore, the decreased activity and considerably low stabil-
ity are obtained over the Pt5Ga/CeAl catalyst. The optimal
loading content of Ga is around 3 wt %, which results in the
maximal propylene selectivity together with the best catalytic
stability against coke accumulation.
