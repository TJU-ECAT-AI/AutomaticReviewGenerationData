ABSTRACT 
Single-atom site (SA) catalysts on N-doped carbon (CN) materials exhibit prominent performance for their active sites being M-Nx. 
Due to the commonly random doping behaviors of N species in these CN, it is a tough issue to finely regulate their doping types 
and clarify their effect on the catalytic property of such catalysts. Herein, we report that the N-doping type in CN can be dominated 
as pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N respectively through compounding with different metal oxides. It is found that the proportion of distinct 
doped N species in CN depends on the acidity and basicity of compounded metal oxide host. Owing to the coordination by 
pyrrolic-N, the SA Cu catalyst displays an enhanced activity (two-fold) for transfer hydrogenation of quinoline to access the valuable 
molecule tetrahydroquinoline with a good selectivity (99%) under mild conditions. The higher electron density of SA Cu species 
induced by the predominate pyrrolic-N coordination benefits the hydrogen transfer process and reduces the energy barrier of the 
hydrogenation pathway, which accounts for the improved catalytic effeciency.

1 Introduction 
Nitrogen-doped carbon (CN) material supported single-atom 
site (SA) catalysts have attracted growing interest for their broad 
applications in electrochemistry [1–3], organic synthesis [4–6] 
and industrial catalysis [7–9]. In general, metal centers (M) 
in such catalysts are coordinated with nitrogen atoms (N) 
embedded in the matrix of carbon, forming M-Nx as active 
sites [10–13]. The nature of these nitrogen atoms thereby have 
great effect on the catalytic property of the metal centers in 
M-Nx [14]. As for most CN carriers in SA catalysts, nitrogen atoms 
are commoly doped in various types such as pyridinic-N, 
pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N [15, 16]. Apparently, the different 
doped nitrogen atoms have distinct characteristics and will 
make metal centers display variant catalytic behaviors [17, 18]. 
In order to rationally tune the performance of SA catalysts 
on CN, it is essential to clearly understand the correlation of 
these nitrogen-doping types with the catalytic performance of 
central metals. 
Given the nitrogen species usually doping randomly in CN, 
it is necessary to finely control the doping types of such 
nitrogen species for disclosing their impact on the performance 
of SA catalysts. In most cases, the pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N 
are predominantly doped nitrogen species in CN and are 
frequently considered as desired binding sites for metal centers 
[19]. So far, there have been some strategies applied to tailor 
the doped N species in CN materials. These strategies include 
the change of the doping temperature with different molecular 
nitrogen sources [19], the utilization of metal salts as the 
modifier during pyrolysis [20, 21], and application of special 
physical technical like laser irradiation [17]. Although such 
approaches successfully adjust the main N-doping type in CN 
to be pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N together, but they can not 
achieve the separation of the pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N into 
individual ones. Therefore, it is an urgent and challening task to 
precisely regulate the nitrogen-doping types in CN as specific 
pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N separatively and further revealing 
their potentail infulence on the performance of supported 
SA catalysts. 
Here we demonstrate a compounding metal oxides (MOx) 
strategy to effectively alter the doping type of nitrogen atoms 
in CN as major pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N respectively for 
optimizing the performance of supported SA Cu catalyst in 
transfer hydrogenation of quinoline. Compared with the 
pyridinic-N, the dominant pyrrolic-N in CN improves the 
activity of the SA Cu catalyst by ~ 2 folds to produce 1,2,3,4-

tetrahydroquinoline (THQ), a versatile intermediate for construc-
ting agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and natural products [22–27]. 
In general, heterogeneous hydrogenation of quinoline relies 
on noble metal catalysts with selectivity issues or suffering 
from harsh reaction conditions (high temperature and high 
pressure of H2) [28–34]. In this work, through the controllable 
pyrrolic-N coordantion, the SA Cu catalyst realizes the hydro-
genation of quinolines in 99% selectivity under mild conditions 
(60 oC for 2 h) with ammonia-borane (AB) as the hydrogen 
source. Our study reveals the existent form of doped nitrogen 
species in CN of the catalyst is found to be concerned with the 
acidity and basicity of compounded metal oxides. The enchanced 
activity of the SA Cu catalyst with main pyrrolic-N instead of 
pyridinic-N can be ascribed to individual Cu active centers 
possessing higher electron density, which facilitates the 
hydrogen transfer process and reduces the energy barrier in 
the hydrogenation pathway. 
2  Results and discussion 
To begin our study, TiO2 and Al2O3 are chosen as the host to 
compound with the CN material which supported SA Cu species 
(Fig. S1 in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM)). 
Firstly, a melamine-formaldehyde resin (MF) coating layer is 
formed through the in-situ polymerization of melamine and 
formaldehyde on the surface of TiO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles 
(Figs. S2 and S3 in the ESM) [35]. After pyrolysis, the MF layer 
transforms into CN material covered on the TiO2 and Al2O3, as 
can be seen from the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra 
and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) 
images (Fig. S3 in the ESM, and Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)). It is 
noteworthy that no visible copper or copper oxides can be found 
on the formed CN material by HR-TEM, scanning transmission 
electron microscopy (STEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD)  
detections (Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), Figs. S4 and S5 in the ESM). 
Further energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping 
analysis indicates a homogeneous dispersion of copper species 
on the CN of the two catalysts (Fig. S4 in the ESM). To evidence 
the existence of SA Cu species, we carried out the aberration 
corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission 
electron microscopy (AC HAADF-STEM) tests on the synthesized

catalysts. It is clear that a number of bright dots representing 
individual Cu species appear on the CN in both Cu1/CN/TiO2 
and Cu1/CN/Al2O3 catalysts (Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), and Fig. S6 in 
the ESM). The loading content of these SA Cu species is 1.1 
and 1.3 weight percent (wt.%) respectively in Cu1/CN/TiO2 
and Cu1/CN/Al2O3 as determined by the inductively coupled 
plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). 
The local atomic and electronic structural information of 
SA Cu species in the two catalysts is gained through X-ray 
absorption spectrometry (XAS) studies. Fourier transformed 
extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectra 
of Cu1/CN/TiO2 and Cu1/CN/Al2O3 at Cu K-edge are displayed 
in Fig. 2(a), it shows that they are significantly different from 
that of CuO, Cu2O and Cu foil (for corresponding EXAFS in

k-space, see Fig. S7 in the ESM). Only a dominant shell peak at 
~1.5 Å but no Cu-Cu shell peak at ~ 2.2 Å can be distinguished in 
both two catalysts, demonstrating the sole presence of SA Cu 
species in them. This dominant shell peak can be assigned to 
the Cu-N contribution due to the detected Cu-N interaction 
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements 
which show the decreased binding energy of N 1s signal for 
Cu1/CN/TiO2 and Cu1/CN/Al2O3 compared to pure CN/TiO2 
and CN/Al2O3 (for characterizations, see Fig. S8 in the ESM), 
indicating the Cu-Nx coordination structure of SA Cu species 
in both two catalysts (Fig. S9 in the ESM) [36]. Moreover, 
these SA Cu species are found to possess positive charges 
according to the corresponding X-ray absorption near-edge 
structure (XANES) spectra of Cu1/CN/TiO2 and Cu1/CN/Al2O3, 
which shows similar edge shapes to that of CuO (Fig. 2(b)). 
Nonetheless, the less intense white line peak of Cu1/CN/TiO2 
than that of Cu1/CN/Al2O3 reflects the higher electron density 
of SA Cu species in the former [37]. This phenomenon can be 
also found by their XPS spectra in the Cu 2p region, which 
show a lower binding energy of the Cu 2p peak for Cu1/CN/ 
TiO2 than that for Cu1/CN/Al2O3 (Fig. 2(c)). In addition, there is 
only one peak can be deconvoluted from their corresponding 
Cu 2p3/2 XPS signals, suggesting no mixed oxidation states of 
Cu species in these two catalysts (Fig. 2(d)). 
The changed electronic property of SA Cu centers derives 
from the different structure of the CN layer as revealed by the 
corresponding elemental analysis and XPS studies. Elemental 
analysis manifests that the ratio of N to C is distinct between 
Cu1/CN/TiO2 (N/C = 0.25) and Cu1/CN/Al2O3 (N/C = 1.00), 
indicating different structures of their CN layers (Table S1 in 
the ESM). From deconvoluted N 1s XPS spectra in Fig. 2(e) 
(for fitting parameters, see Table S2 in the ESM), it can be 
observed that the CN layer in Cu1/CN/TiO2 involves the 
pyrrolic-N (~ 399.8 eV
, 83%) as the major doped nitrogen species 
with small portions of pyridinic-N (~ 398.8 eV, 12%) and 
graphitic-N (~ 400.8 eV
, 5%) [38, 39]. However in Cu1/CN/Al2O3, 
the dominant nitrogen-doping type of the CN layer is signi-
ficantly different for it changes to be the pyridinic-N (~ 398.7 eV
, 
63%). The different proportion of doped N species can be also 
detected in the CN material on SiO2 and MgO hosts. It can be 
observed that the major N-doping type in Cu1/CN/SiO2 is 
pyridinic-N (40%) and pyrrolic-N (44%), while in Cu1/CN/MgO 
it is still the pyridinic-N (53%) which is similar to that in 
Cu1/CN/Al2O3 (Fig. 2(e)) (for characterizations of Cu1/CN/SiO2 and 
Cu1/CN/MgO, see Figs. S10 and S11 in the ESM). Considering 
that the CN material is formed from the MF coating layer 
pyrolyzing on the oxide, the distinct surface nature of the 
oxide probably has great influence on the pyrolysis process 
and results in the disparate structure of the CN material. The 
different surface nature of these oxides can be reflected from 
their distinct acidity and basicity which is verified through 
their different pH values in water (Table S3 in the ESM). As is 
shown in Fig. 2(f), it is clear that the proportion of pyrrolic-N 
species in the CN layer is the highest on the acidic oxide (TiO2), 
medium on the neutral oxide (SiO2), and lowest on basic 
oxides (Al2O3 and MgO). As for doped pyridinic-N species, 
the variation tendency is reversed and basic oxides (Al2O3 and 
MgO) lead to the highest proportion of pyridinic-N doping 
type in the CN layer. These results demonstrate that the 
acidity and basicity of oxide hosts has great influence on the 
distribution of different N-doping types in the CN material on 
them, and the dominant pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N doping 
type can be controlled to form on the acidic oxide and basic 
oxide respectively. 
To investigate the impact of distinct N-doping types on the 
catalytic property of SA Cu catalsyts, we next evaluate the 
performance of Cu1/CN/TiO2 and Cu1/CN/Al2O3 for the 
transfer hydrogenation of quinoline. When using AB as the 
hydrogen source, we are delighted to find that the quinoline 
substrate can be hydrogenated smoothly on Cu1/CN/TiO2 
under a mild condition (at 60 oC for 2 h), affording the target 
product THQ (2) in top yield of 94% (Fig. 3(a)). The selectivity of 
THQ is up to 99% according to gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometer (GC-MS) analysis, from which no by-products 
like 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline (3) and decahydroquinoline (4) 
are detected (Fig. S12 in the ESM). Compared with Cu1/CN/TiO2, 
Cu1/CN/Al2O3 performs a relatively worse activity, providing 
THQ in just 42% yield under the same condition, although its 
selectivity also reaches 99% (Fig. 3(b)). The calculated turnover 
frequency (TOF) value of Cu1/CN/TiO2 is 104 h–1 at reaction 
time of 0.5 h, which is nearly twice higher than that of 
Cu1/CN/Al2O3 (Fig. 3(c), entries 1 and 2 in Table S4 in the 
ESM). Control experiments testify no reactions occurring on 
the composite carrier CN/TiO2 and CN/Al2O3 (entries 3 and 4 
in Table S4 in the ESM), which suggests the different activities 
of two SA Cu catalysts arising from their distinct Cu active 
centers. It is worth noting that the TiO2 supported Cu nano-
particle catalyst (Cu NP/TiO2, for characterizations see Fig. S13 in 
the ESM) is even unable to catalyze this hydrogenation 
reaction at the same conditions (Fig. 3(c), entry 5 in Table S4 
in the ESM). As the same to Cu NP/TiO2, Cu powder is not 
active for such reaction either (Fig. 3(c), entry 6 in Table S4 in 
the ESM). In contrast, CuO and Cu2O both can realize this 
hydrogenation process, although their TOF values are not 
more than 45 h−1 (Fig. 3(c), entries 7 and 8 in Table S4 in the 
ESM). These results suggest that the catalytic active species for 
this transfer hydrogenation reaction should be positively 
charged Cu species, and the prominent catalytic property of 
Cu1/CN/TiO2 may be concerned with the specific electronic 
structure of its SA Cu species. Moreover, the Cu1/CN/TiO2 
catalyst can be recovered and reused at least five times without 
obvious loss of activity and selectivity (Fig. 3(d)). Corresponding 
characterizations on the recovered catalyst manifest the remaining 
SA Cu species, reflecting the good stability of Cu1/CN/TiO2 
(Figs. S14 and S15 in the ESM).

The notable improved activity of Cu1/CN/TiO2 in contrast 
to Cu1/CN/Al2O3  can be ascribed to different doped N 
species in two catalysts for their active sites being Cu-Nx structure. 
To better understand this phenomenon, density functional 
theory (DFT) calculation studies are next performed to gain 
more information. According to the Bader charge analysis, the 
charge on the Cu species is 0.712 e in the pyridinic-N 
coordination, which is higher than that in the pyrrolic-N 
coordination (0.655 e), illustrating the higher electron density 
of the Cu species in the latter (Table S5 in the ESM). This 
result is consistent with the conclusion drawn from Figs. 2(b) 
and 2(c), further testifying that the pyrrolic-N doping type can 
increase the electron density of coordinated SA Cu species in 
comparison with the pyridinic-N doping type. In the transfer 
hydrogenation pathway, hydrogen species shifting from AB 
molecule to active Cu centers is the initial step (Fig. S16 in 
the ESM) [40–42]. Therefore, we investigate the adsorption 
performance of AB molecule on the two SA Cu structures. As 
displayed in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), compared with pyridinic-N 
coordination structure, the pyrrolic-N coordination structure 
reduces the adsorption energy (Eads) of AB from −1.437 to 
−1.685 eV, elucidating the more favorable adsorption of AB 
molecule to transfer hydrogen on Cu1/CN/TiO2 than on 
Cu1/CN/Al2O3. Based on the differential charge density analysis, 
when the AB molecule adsorbs on the Cu species, they both 
need to provide electrons for the formation of the Cu-H bond 
(Figs. 4(c) and 4(d)). Therefore, the higher electron density of Cu 
species resulted from the pyrrolic-N coordination is apparently 
beneficial to this process. This conclusion can be evidenced by the 
fact that Cu2O, possessing more negative Cu species (Fig. S13(b) 
in the ESM), can achieve the transfer hydrogenation reaction 
more efficiently than CuO (Fig. 3(c)). Furthermore, the complete 
quinoline hydrogenation process on the coordination of pyridinic- 
N and pyrrolic-N is analyzed, respectively. As shown in Figs. 4(e) 
and 4(f), the highest energy barrier is 0.040 eV in four hydro-
genation elementary steps on the pyrrolic-N coordination 
structure, which is much lower than that on the pyridinic-N 
coordination structure (0.250 eV). Hence, the coordination of 
pyrrolic-N is more advantageous for quinoline hydrogenation 
reaction which is consistent with our above conjecture and the 
experimental results. 
3  Conclusion 
In summary, we report that nitrogen atoms in CN materials 
can be controlled to dope in specific types by compounding with 
metal oxides and lead to the tuned activity of the supported 
SA Cu catalyst for transfer hydrogenation of quinoline. The 
CN material from the pyrolysis of the MF coating layer on the 
acidic and basic MOx host can display the major nitrogen-doping 
type as pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N respectively. In contrast to 
the pyridinic-N, the doped pyrrolic-N dramatically enhances 
the performance of SA Cu catalyst for hydrogenation of 
quinoline with AB, providing the THQ in good yield and 
selectivity under mild reaction conditions. The SA Cu species 
coordinated with pyrrolic-N take on the higher electron 
density which is in favor of promoting the hydrogen transfer 
process from AB molecule and results in the much lower 
energy barrier in the quinoline hydrogenation pathway, and so 
improves the activity of the SA Cu catalyst for the transfer 
hydrogenation of quinoline.
