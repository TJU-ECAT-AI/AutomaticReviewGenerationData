A series of bare ZrO2 materials composed either of monoclinic or tetragonal phase with the size of crys-
tallites varying between 3.7 and 43.4 nm were prepared by precipitation, hydrothermal or thermal cal-
cination methods. The samples
were characterized by XRD, BET,
CO-TPR, NH3-TPD, electrical
conductivity measurements and operando UV–vis spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations
provided molecular insights into the kind of active site and individual steps of propane dehydrogenation
to propene and hydrogen. Regardless of the phase composition, two Zr cations located at an oxygen
vacancy, i.e. coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) having, nevertheless, different chemical
environment in tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2, were concluded to be responsible for homolytic breaking
of CAH bonds in propane. Monoclinic ZrO2 showed, however, higher rate of propene formation and
higher propene selectivity than ZrO2 stabilized in the tetragonal phase. Both the activity and the selectiv-
ity to propene increased with a decrease in the size of crystallites. The effects of phase composition and
crystallite size on the PDH performance were related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon
reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create Zrcus sites. The knowledge derived can be used for further
optimizing PDH performance of ZrO2-based catalysts and also extended to other non-reducible metal
oxides.

1. Introduction
Propene is widely used for the manufacture of a large number of
chemicals relevant for our everyday life [1,2]. Its production and
demand continue to grow because of the higher consumption of
the downstream products made of propene. The global annual pro-
pene market is estimated to reach 165 million tons by 2030 com-
pared to 103 million in 2012 [3,4]. Nowadays, propene is mainly
produced through steam (60–65%) or ﬂuid catalytic cracking
(30%) of various oil fractions [5,6]. However, these two processes
cannot fulﬁll the demands for propene. Therefore, some on-
purpose
technologies,
such
as
metathesis
of
ethylene
with
2-butenes [7], methanol to oleﬁns or propene [8] and propane
dehydrogenation (PDH) [3] have been developed to close the gap
between propene demand and production.
PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene pro-
duction and offers high propene selectivity. The two main indus-
trial processes are Catoﬁn and Oleﬂex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and
Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively [3]. Such catalysts are highly
active and selective, however, have some drawbacks [3,9–11]. In
particular, Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlo-
rine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species [3], while Cr(VI)
may cause various health effects. Apart from Pt-based or CrOx-
based catalysts, there are some alternatives reported in literature.
They include materials on the basis of ZnO [12–14], GaOx [15,16],
VOx [17–19], isolated FeII [20] and CoII [21]. None of them has,
however, been commercialized. This is due to the lower catalytic
performance (activity, selectivity and durability) compared with
commercial catalysts and insufﬁcient understanding of structure–
activity-selectivity
relationship
required
for
tailored
catalyst
design. It is usually not easy to establish such relationship as (i)
the PDH reaction requires high temperature hindering application
of operando characterization techniques and (ii) molecular struc-
tures of catalytically active species are typically unknown and
may change under dynamic reaction conditions.

Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on
the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-
efﬁcient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing
catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity
and oleﬁn selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and
C4 alkanes [22–25]. Coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations
(Zrcus) are supposed to be active sites for the dehydrogenation
reaction. Such sites can be created by doping of zirconia with some
metal oxides or by high-temperature reductive treatment or by
loading tiny amounts of metal nanoparticles, such as Ru and Rh.
Our very recent study investigated the effect of crystallite size of
bare monoclinic ZrO2 on the activity and propene selectivity in
PDH. It was found that the activity in PDH could be tuned by
changing crystallite size: the smaller the crystallite size, the higher
the activity is [26]. The highest activity achieved over bare mono-
clinic ZrO2 was comparable to that of commercial CrOx/Al2O3 cata-
lyst. DFT calculations suggested that the active site of monoclinic
ZrO2 consists of two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy.
This work aims to validate a new strategy for regulating the
activity and especially selectivity of ZrO2 in PDH through phase
composition and crystallite size. A principle goal was to identify
the kind of active sites for the non-oxidative propane dehydro-
genation (PDH) to propene and for coke formation and the factors
affecting their generation over tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2. To
address these challenges, we followed a complementary approach
combining controlled material synthesis with steady-state cat-
alytic tests and catalyst characterization by XRD, BET, NH3-TPD,
CO-TPR, electrical conductivity measurements and operando UV–
vis spectroscopy. The latter technique was instrumental for eluci-
dating mechanistic aspects of coke formation. In addition, density
functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to derive molec-
ular insights into the kind of active site and individual reaction
pathways leading from propane to propene.
2. Experimental
2.1. DFT calculations
Spin-polarized and periodic DFT calculations were carried out
using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [27,28].
Exchange and correlation were treated within the Perdew-Burke-
Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) [29]
{Perdew, 1996 #275; Perdew, 1996 #514}. To obtain accurate
energies with errors of less than 1 meV per atom, a cutoff energy
of 400 eV was used. Geometry optimization was converged until
forces acting on atoms were lower than 0.02 eV/Å, whereas the
energy threshold deﬁning self-consistency of the electron density
was set to 104 eV. The Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band (CI-
NEB) method with eight images was applied for ﬁnding transition
states and minimum energy paths of all reactions with a force tol-
erance of 0.05 eV/Å [30]. The ﬁnal transition state structures were
reﬁned by using the quasi-Newton algorithm until the Hellman-
Feynman forces on each ion were lower than 0.02 eV/Å. The normal
mode frequency analysis was performed to validate the optimized
transition states and each authentic transition state has only one
imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinates. The resulted
zero-point vibrational energies (ZPE) from the frequency analysis
are included in our energetic discussion. The slab with nine layers
was ﬁxed and the surface-adsorbed molecules (partial Hessian) or
intermediates are relaxed.
Since XRD analysis proved that our catalysts are mainly com-
posed of the tetragonal phase (as shown below), we calculated
tetragonal ZrO2 (t-ZrO2) models. For the optimization of the bulk
structure, the lattice parameters of the t-ZrO2 phase were deter-
mined by minimizing the total energy of the unit cell by using a
conjugated gradient algorithm to relax the ions. A 9  9  6
Monkhorst-Pack k point grid was used for sampling the Brillouin
zone [31]. The calculated lattice parameters of the unit cell,
a = b = 3.632 and c = 5.231 Å, are in excellent agreement with the
experimental values (a = b = 3.64 and c = 5.27 Å) [32] as well as
other theoretical results [33,34] summarized in Table S1. This
agreement clearly validates our computational methodology.
Among all t-ZrO2 surfaces, the (1 0 1) termination with O-Zr-O
surface was found to be most stable [35–37]. The t-ZrO2(1 0 1) sur-
face was modelled by a nine-layer slab with the lowest three layers
ﬁxed in the bulk positions and the upper six layers being allowed
to relax. In all cases, a p(2  3) lateral supercell containing a vac-
uum space of 15 Å between the slab and its periodic replicas was
used. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 3  3  1 Mon-
khorst–Pack mesh.
The oxygen-defective t-ZrO2(1 0 1) surface was computed by
removal of a neutral oxygen atom. The vacancy formation energy,
Ef(Ov), was calculated according to equation Ef(Ov) = Ed + 1/2EO2 -
 Es, where Ed is the energy of oxygen defect surface slab and Es
is the energy of the clean surface slab, while EO2 is the energy of
gas-phase O2 molecule. The oxygen vacancy formation energy is
a measure of the reducibility of the oxide. The higher the (positive)
value, the lower the reducibility is.
The adsorption energy is deﬁned by Eads = EX+s/d  Es/d  EX,
where EX+s/d is the total energy of the slab (clean or oxygen defect
surface) with adsorbents in its equilibrium geometry, Es/d is the
total energy of the slab (clean or oxygen defect surface) and EX is
gas-phase species. The more negative the adsorption energy, the
stronger the adsorption is. The activation barrier (or activation
energy, Ea) and reaction energy (DEr) are calculated according to
Ea = ETS  EIS and DEr = EFS  EIS, where EIS, EFS and ETS are the ener-
gies of the corresponding initial state (IS), ﬁnal state (FS) and tran-
sition state (TS) respectively.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
Tetragonal
ZrO2
samples
were
prepared
by
precipitation
method. ZrOCl28H2O (98%, Aldrich) or ZrO(NO3)2xH2O (99%,
Aldrich) were used as zirconia precursors, ammonium hydroxide
solution (25%, Roth) or ethylene diamine (greater than99%, Merck)
were used as precipitation agents. t-ZrO2_1 and t-ZrO2_2 were syn-
thesized using ZrO(NO3)2xH2O and ammonium hydroxide solu-
tion.
Firstly,
41.237 g
of
ZrO(NO3)2xH2O
were
dissolved
in
243 mL of H2O to get a solution with a zirconium concentration
of 0.5 molL1. Hereafter, an ammonium hydroxide solution was
added dropwise to the above solution until the pH value reached
10. The obtained mixture was heated to 100 C while maintaining
the same pH value. The precipitated product was then stirred for
10 days, ﬁltered, washed with deionized water and dried. t-
ZrO2_1 and t-ZrO2_2 samples were obtained after calcination of
the dried product at 500 C and 600 C for 4 h respectively. t-
ZrO2_3 was prepared in a similar way but using ZrOCl28H2O as a
zirconia precursor. The absence of chloride anions in the precipi-
tate was proven by the reaction of ﬁltrate with AgNO3. This sample
was obtained after calcination of the dried product at 700 C for
5 h. t-ZrO2_4 was prepared using ZrOCl28H2O and ethylene dia-
mine. Firstly, 7.251 g of ZrOCl28H2O were dissolved in 500 mL
H2O and then ethylene diamine was added into the above solution
dropwise until the pH value reached 11. Hereafter, the mixture was
heated to 100 C and stirred for 24 h. The precipitated product was
ﬁltered, washed, dried, and calcined at 800 C for 4 h.
Monoclinic and amorphous ZrO2 catalysts are from our previous

m-ZrO2_2,

respectively.

of

itation method using ZrOCl28H2O as precursor.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a Panalytical
X’Pert diffractometer equipped with a Xcelerator detector, auto-
matic divergence slits and Cu tube (ka1/a2 radiation, 40 kV,
40 mA, k = 0.015406 nm, 0.0154443 nm). Cu beta-radiation was
excluded by using nickel ﬁlter foil. The crystallite size was calcu-
lated by the Scherrer equation (Eq. (1))

where K parameter was set to 1.0747, b is the integrated breadth of
(1 1 1) reﬂection peak, h is the diffraction angel.
Speciﬁc surface area (SBET) of the catalysts was measured by
nitrogen physisorption experiments at 77 K using a Belsorp mini
Ⅱsetup (Bel Japan). Desorption isotherms were evaluated accord-
ing to the BET method.
Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 was carried
out in an in-house developed setup containing eight individually
heated continuous-ﬂow ﬁxed-bed quartz reactors. The following
procedure was applied. The catalysts (0.05 to 0.1 g) were initially
calcined in air ﬂow at 550 C for 1 h, purged with Ar for 15 min
and then treated in a ﬂow consisting of 57 vol% H2 in Ar for 1 h.
After that, the catalysts were cooled down in Ar ﬂow to 120 C.
Then the catalysts were exposed to a ﬂow of NH3 (1 vol% NH3 in
Ar, 14 mLmin1) for 1 h. Hereafter, the catalysts were cooled down
in Ar ﬂow to 80 C. Before starting NH3-TPD, the catalysts were
purged in Ar ﬂow at 80 C for 2 h to remove weakly adsorbed
NH3. Finally, the catalysts were heated to 900 C with a heating
rate of 10 Kmin1 in Ar ﬂow (10 mLmin1). Desorbed NH3 was
monitored by an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum
OmniStar GSD 320) at the atomic mass unit (AMU) of 15 (NH).
Ar (AMU of 40) was used as inert standard.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were
performed using a feed consisting of 1 vol% CO in Ar. Catalysts
(0.2 g) were ﬁrstly calcined in air ﬂow at 550 C for 1 h, then cooled
down in the same ﬂow to room temperature and purged in Ar ﬂow
to remove oxygen. Hereafter, they were heated in a ﬂow of 1 vol%
CO in Ar (10 mLmin1) to 900 C with a heating rate of 10 Kmin1.
The consumption of CO was detected by an on-line mass spectrom-
eter (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320). The signals at AMUs of
28 (CO and CO2), 44 (CO2) and 40 (Ar) were recorded.
Overall electrical conductivity of catalysts was measured in a
ﬁxed-bed continuous-ﬂow tubular quartz reactor. Firstly, the cata-
lyst was pressed into a dense disc of 7.1 mm in diameter and 1.2–
2.0 mm in thickness to minimize interior grain boundaries. Both
surfaces of the disc were covered with a platinum conducting paste
(ChemPur, 71% Pt) and dried at 120 C. Hereafter, a sample disc
was sandwiched between two inert platinum electrodes and
arranged inside the reactor. 1 kHz alternating current was adjusted
with an automatically compensating bridge (Wayne Kerr B905). At
this mono-frequency regime, the contributions of both surface and
bulk conductivity are regarded similar for all samples, owing to the
identical treatment of the sample discs. As an equivalent circuit, a
parallel connection of a condenser and an ohmic resistance was
applied. Electrical conductivity of catalysts was measured at
550 C in air and N2 to ensure different partial pressures of oxygen,
i.e. 20 kPa and about 104 kPa respectively. The electrical conduc-
tivity of the catalysts was calculated according to Eq. (2).
r ¼ 1=R  h=S
ð2Þ
where R is the electrical resistance (X), h is the thickness (mm) and
S is the cross section area (mm2) of the catalyst disc.
Operando UV–vis tests were performed at 550 C in an in-house
developed set-up equipped with an AVASPEC ﬁber optical spec-
trometer (Avantes), a DH-2000 deuterium-halogen light source
and a CCD array detector. A high-temperature reﬂection UV–vis
probe consisting of 6 radiating optical ﬁbers and 1 reading ﬁber
was threaded through the furnace to face quartz reactor walls at
the position where catalysts were held [38]. The catalysts were
ﬁrstly heated in N2 ﬂow up to 550 C followed by calcination in
air ﬂow for 1 h. Then they were purged with N2 for 15 min, treated
with H2 ﬂow (57 vol% H2 in N2) for 1 h, ﬂushed in N2 for 15 min,
and then reacted with a feed containing 40 vol% C3H8 in N2. The
catalyst amount and ﬂow were set to 0.1–0.2 g and 6–40 mLmin1
respectively to keep the initial propane conversion over all cata-
lysts about 10%. For analyzing carbon deposition during PDH, we
deﬁned relative reﬂectance (Rrel) as the ratio of the reﬂectance of
the catalysts with coke deposits (RDH) to the fully oxidized ones
(RO2) according to Eq. (3). From this reﬂectance, we calculated
the relative Kubelka-Munk function F(Rrel) according to Eq. (4).

2.4. Catalyst tests
All catalytic tests were performed at 1 bar in an in-house devel-
oped setup consisting of 15 continuous-ﬂow ﬁxed-bed quartz reac-
tors. To determine the rate of propene formation, the tests were
carried out at a degree of propane conversion below 10% using a
feed containing 40 vol% C3H8 in N2. The amount of the catalyst
and the total ﬂow of reaction mixture were set to 0.1 g and
20 mLmin1 respectively. The catalysts were ﬁrstly heated in N2
ﬂow up to 550 C followed by calcination in air ﬂow for 1 h. Then
they were purged with N2 for 15 min, treated with H2 ﬂow
(57 vol% H2 in N2) for 1 h and ﬂushed in N2 for 15 min. Finally, a
ﬂow of C3H8-N2 mixture (40 vol% C3H8 in N2) was passed through
the catalyst bed. The initial rate of propene formation was mea-
sured after 190 s on stream.
To establish the dependence of product selectivity on propane
conversion, we performed catalytic tests at 550 C with the cata-
lysts reduced in a ﬂow of H2 (57 vol% H2 in N2). Catalyst amount
(0.8 to 1.5 g) and total ﬂow (6 to 80 mLmin1) were varied to
get different contact times and accordingly different degrees of
propane conversion.
An overall activation energy of propane dehydrogenation was
determined in the temperature range between 500 and 550 C over
the catalysts pre-reduced at 550 C in a ﬂow of H2 (57 vol% H2 in
N2) for 1 h. Catalyst amount used in these tests was varied from
0.1 to 0.4 g depending on the sample, while the total ﬂow of the
reaction
feed
was
set
to
10 mLmin1,
10 mLmin1
and
20 mLmin1 for 500, 525 and 550 C respectively.
The feed components and the reaction products were analyzed
by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890) equipped with
PLOT/Q (for CO2), AL/S (for hydrocarbons), and Molsieve 5 (for
H2, O2, N2, and CO) columns as well as ﬂame ionization and ther-
mal conductivity detectors.
Eqs. (5)–(9) were used to calculate the rate of propene
formation (r(C3H6) expressed as mmol(C3H6)g1

3. Results and discussion
3.1. DFT calculations of individual reaction pathways
We shall start with the presentation and discussion of the
results of DFT calculations of propane dehydrogenation over
t-ZrO2 and will compare them with those obtained in our previous
study for monoclinic ZrO2 (m-ZrO2) [26]. The purpose was to check
if the kind of active sites and individual reaction steps for propene
formation depend on the phase composition of ZrO2. As the (1 0 1)
facet is the most stable termination surface of t-ZrO2 [35–37] this
surface was selected for the calculations. We computed individual
reaction pathways leading from propane to propene on the ideal
and oxygen-defective (1 0 1) surfaces. Surface oxygen vacancy
(Ov) was created by removal of a neutral oxygen atom (O3c
I
or
O3c
II ) or with help of CO or H2 in form of CO2 or H2O (Table S2). In
comparison with O3c
II , O3c
I
(Fig. S1) was established to be 0.38 eV
more energetically (5.45 vs. 5.83 eV for O3c
I
and O3c
II respectively)
preferable species to form surface oxygen vacancy (Table S2). Thus,
the defective t-ZrO2(1 0 1) surface in our model was created
through removal of one O3c
I
species (Fig. S1(b)). It is worth men-
tioning that oxygen vacancy on the surface of t-ZrO2 (1 0 1) and
m-ZrO2 (1

1 1) have very different local chemical environment.
For m-ZrO2 (1

1 1), the removed oxygen atom was connected to
two Zr atoms, while three Zr atoms were around the oxygen atom
removed from t-ZrO2 (1 0 1). To derive molecular insights into
electron distribution inside the anion vacancy, we further com-
puted the spin density and the density of states (DOS) for the clean
surface and the surface with an oxygen vacancy (Fig S2). We found
that the Zr cation is only very slightly reduced and remains mainly
formal Zr4+ on the basis of the computed Barde charge (the three Zr
cations near the vacancy accumulate 0.20, 0.16 and 0.16e as com-
pared with those of the clean surface). In addition, the DOS of Zr
center on both surfaces are approximately the same, apart from
some electrons at the Fermi level. Thus, electrons generated upon
oxygen vacancy formation remain delocalized.
To identify the kind of active site and the mode of dissociation
of methylene CAH bond over defective t-ZrO2 (1 0 1), we computed
the reaction on three different sites: (i) one lattice oxygen and one
saturated Zr site (Zr6c
Ia-O3c
I , Zr6c
Ia-O3c
II , Zr6c
II –O3c
II , Zr7c
I –O3c
I
or Zr7c

in Fig. S1 (a)), (ii) two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy
([Zr6c
Ia, Zr6c
II ]-Ov or [Zr6c
II , Zr6c
Ib]-Ov in Fig. S1 (b)) and (iii) two lattice
oxygen species (O3c
I –O3c
II in Fig S1 (a)). The most thermodynami-
cally preferable pathway was concluded to be homolytic breaking
of the C-H bond on the [Zr6c
Ia, Zr6c
II ]-Ov or [Zr6c
II , Zr6c
Ib]-Ov sites
(Fig. 1, Fig. S3, Table S3), which is exothermic by 0.91 or 0.29 eV
(Fig. S4). The full potential energy surfaces of the most preferred
routes on defective t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2 surfaces are shown in
Fig. 1, while the Gibbs free energy proﬁles are given in Fig. S5. Sim-
ilar to our recent DFT calculations of propane dehydrogenation
over m-ZrO2 [26], the overall apparent barrier for this reaction over
the oxygen-defective t-ZrO2 (1 0 1) facet is signiﬁcantly lower
(1.13 vs. 1.90 eV) than that over the ideal facet (Fig. 1 and Fig. S3).
It is also obvious from Fig. 1 and Fig. S5 that the energy proﬁles
in the course of propane dehydrogenation reaction over oxygen-
defective m-ZrO2(1

1 1) and oxygen-defective t-ZrO2(1 0 1) have
the same shape and trend. The individual pathways, however, dif-
fer in the energy values. For example, propene formation over m-
ZrO2(1

1 1) should proceed easier than over t-ZrO2(1 0 1). No sig-
niﬁcant differences could be identiﬁed between these samples in
terms of H2 formation.
The conclusion about the mode (homotytic vs. heterolytic) of C-
H bond breaking was drawn on the basis of the following argu-
ments: (i) DFT calculations predict that both H and iso-C3H7 inter-
act with surface Zr atoms having the same charge rather than with
one Zr and one O atom, which are differently charged and (ii) the
computed Bader Charge of the H atom and the central C atom in
iso-C3H7 is negative and does not signiﬁcantly differ from each
other (-0.33e and 0.29e for H and C3H7 respectively).
The importance of surface defects for propane dehydrogenation
over t-ZrO2 is in agreement with our previous calculations dealt
with m-ZrO2 [26]. Thus, regardless of ZrO2 phase composition,
two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy, which has different
local environment in t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2, are responsible for pro-
pane activation, while catalytic centers consisting of one lattice
oxygen and one saturated Zr site or two lattice oxygen species do
not seem to be relevant. On an elementary step level, iso-C3H7 frag-
ment formed upon homolytic breaking of the C-H bond in C3H8 is
bound at the Zr6c
Ia or Zr6c
II
site, while the remaining H atom is
located in a bridge position between the Zr6c
Ib and Zr6c
II cations.
The methylene CAH activation barrier at the [Zr6c
Ia, Zr6c
II ]-Ov site
is lower than that at the [Zr6c
II , Zr6c
Ib]-Ov site (0.42 vs. 0.61 eV).
After identifying the mode of methylene CAH activation, we
examined several possible routes of methyl CAH bond activation
in iso-C3H7 adsorbed on the Zr6c
Ia or Zr6c
II site (Fig. S6). The most
thermodynamically and kinetically preferred route is methyl
CAH bond dissociation at the (Zr6c
II , Zr6c
Ia)-Ov site with the dissoci-
ated H located at the adjacent Zr6c
Ia center (Fig. 1 and Fig. S6). Pro-
pene formation is an endothermic process (with 0.23 eV) with an
activation barrier of 0.92 eV. The hydrogen formation is also
strongly endothermic by 1.17 eV, while the reversed hydrogen dis-
sociation is a barrier-less process. After considering the methylene
CAH and methyl CAH bond activation together, [Zr6c
II , Zr6c
Ib]-Ov site
is concluded to be more kinetically favorable than [Zr6c
Ia, Zr6c
II ]-Ov
site for propane dehydrogenation to propene.
Although propane dehydrogenation over m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2
occurs on two Zrcus cations, the phase composition of ZrO2 is nev-
ertheless relevant for the PDH reaction as concluded from the
potential energy surfaces shown in Fig. 1 and the Gibbs free energy
proﬁles in Fig. S5. It is obvious that the methylene CAH bond acti-
vation over defective t-ZrO2 (1 0 1) requires higher energy in com-
parison with this process over defective m-ZrO2 (1

1 1); i.e. 0.42 or
316

0.61 eV vs. 0.16 eV. The latter surface is also more favorable for
breaking of the methyl bond in iso-C3H7, which is the surface pre-
cursor formed from C3H8. Such difference between t-ZrO2 (1 0 1)
and m-ZrO2 (1

1 1) might be related to the local structure of two
Zrcus cations forming the active site on these surfaces. Even though
propene formation appears to be a structure-sensitive process,
hydrogen formation does not depend on the phase composition
of ZrO2. This process requires the highest energy, which is 1.13
and 1.24 eV for the defective t-ZrO2 (1 0 1) and m-ZrO2 (1

1 1)
facets respectively. Thus, it should be the rate-limiting step in
the course of PDH over bare ZrO2 regardless of its phase composi-
tion. However, it is noted that the computed barriers are lower
than the experimentally estimated Arrhenius activation energies;
and such differences between theory and experiment have been
reported previously [39].
3.2. Characterization of as-prepared catalysts
Under consideration of the above DFT results about the kind of
active site and the elementary reaction pathways of propane dehy-
drogenation over t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2, one may expect that the
phase composition is not vital for the activity of bare ZrO2 in the
target reaction. To verify this assumption, we prepared several
ZrO2 samples composed of either monoclinic or tetragonal phase.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-prepared materials are
shown in Fig. 2. According to these data, four samples are stabilized
in the tetragonal phase with an average crystallite size of 3.7, 4.6,
5.7 or 8.1 nm, six samples are m-ZrO2 with an average crystallite
size of 9.1, 12.9, 13.0, 18.6, 32.8 or 43.4 nm and one ZrO2 sample
is amorphous (a-ZrO2). The fact that t-ZrO2 samples are composed
of smaller crystallites than their m-ZrO2 counterparts could be due
to the lower surface free energy of t-ZrO2 than that of m-ZrO2.
Accordingly, when the crystallite size is small enough, zirconia is
easily stabilized in t-ZrO2 without any promoter [40,41]. The phase
composition of selected ZrO2 catalysts did not change after cat-
alytic tests (Fig. S7).
Speciﬁc surface area of the catalysts was determined according
to the BET method. The results are shown in Table 1. The highest
surface area of 267 m2g1 was measured for a-ZrO2. For the sam-
ples composed of t-ZrO2 or m-ZrO2 phases, the surface area
increases with a decrease in crystallite size as expected.
Overall acidity of bare ZrO2 materials was determined from
NH3-TPD experiments. The obtained NH3-TPD proﬁles are shown
in Fig. 3(a). NH3 desorption was observed in a broad temperature
range between 200 and 550 C thus proving the presence of acidic
sites of different strength. These sites should be of Lewis character

because Brønsted acidic OH sites are decomposed upon catalyst
treatment at 550 C as proven in our separate study [24]. The tem-
perature of maximal desorption of NH3 for different samples did
not differ strongly and was around 260 C. Thus, the largest frac-
tion of Lewis acidic sites on the surface of all catalysts should be
of similar strength. The density of acidic sites was calculated for
each catalyst under assumption that one NH3 molecule can be
adsorbed on one acidic site. The results are given in Table 1. Among
all samples, m-ZrO2_2 revealed the highest density of acidic sites,
while m-ZrO2_6 showed the lowest one. It was found that the den-
sity of acidic sites increased with decreasing crystallite size for
monoclinic or tetragonal phase, and amorphous ZrO2 showed a
middle acidic density among all catalysts (Fig. S8).
The reducibility (the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen in
the presence of reducing agent) of differently prepared ZrO2 was
investigated by CO-TPR method. Fig. 3(b) shows the proﬁles of
CO consumption for all catalysts in a form of a change of CO mass
spectrometric signal with temperature. In general, the reduction
temperature of the samples composed of t-ZrO2 was at least
100 C higher than that of the samples composed of m-ZrO2, while
the amorphous ZrO2 did not show any measurable CO consump-
tion. The temperature of maximal rate of reduction decreases with
a decrease in crystallite size both for t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2. Such ten-
dency can be explained by the fact that oxygen ions located at cor-
ners/edges or surface defects can be easier removed than those on
the ﬂat non-defective surface and thus the reducibility of metal
oxide will be improved upon decreasing the size of crystallites
[42]. The amount of CO consumed by each sample during the
CO-TPR tests is listed in Table 1. One can see that all m-ZrO2 sam-
ples consumed higher amount of CO per surface area than a-ZrO2
or t-ZrO2.
3.3. Catalyst activity and selectivity
In order to check if and how phase composition of ZrO2 affects
PDH performance, two series of catalytic tests were performed
with the purpose (i) to determine the rate of propene formation
and (ii) to elucidate an overall scheme of product formation. We
shall start with the activity data. Fig. 4(a) shows the rate of pro-
pene formation determined at a degree of propane conversion
below 10% as a function of crystallite size of m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2.
The activity of a-ZrO2 sample is also shown for comparative pur-
poses. Similar to our previous study with m-ZrO2 samples [26],
the rate of propene formation over the t-ZrO2 materials increases
with a decrease in crystallite size. However, there should be a min-
imal size of crystallites, below which ZrO2 will lose its high PDH
activity as concluded from the fact that the rate of propene forma-
tion on a-ZrO2 was low (Fig. 4(a)). As the effect of the size of crys-
tallites on PDH activity is also valid when the rate is calculated per
surface area (Fig. S9), the size should determine the concentration
of catalytically active sites or their intrinsic activity. It is also worth
mentioning that the rate of propene formation per surface area
over m-ZrO2 with the smallest size of crystallites is about 7 times
higher than that of t-ZrO2 sample composed of the smallest crys-
tallites (Fig. S9). Importantly, as seen in Table 1, the crystallite size
of t-ZrO2_4 and m-ZrO2_1 catalysts is 8.1 and 9.1 nm respectively,
i.e. very similar. However, these two materials strongly (about 150
times) differ in the rate of propene formation (Table 1, Fig. 4(a)).
This result implies that the monoclinic phase of ZrO2 is more
preferable for the PDH reaction in terms of activity. This aspect
as well as the size effect on the rate of propene formation will be
discussed in a below separate section under consideration of addi-

tional characterization data. Now we turn our attention to product
selectivity.
To answer the question about the effect of phase composition
and the size of crystallites on the selectivity to propene and unde-
sired products, catalytic tests at different degrees of propane con-
version were carried out over selected t-ZrO2 samples and one
m-ZrO2
with
the
lowest
size
of
crystallites.
The
obtained
selectivity-conversion plots for propene, coke and cracking prod-
ucts (C1-C2 hydrocarbons) are shown in Fig. 4(b), (c) and (d)
respectively. The effect of contact time on product selectivity is
shown in Fig. S10.
Regardless of phase composition and crystallite size, the selec-
tivity to propene is above 85% at propane conversion below 5%
but decreases with increasing propane conversion or contact time.
Contrarily, the selectivity to cracking products and coke (for all
t-ZrO2 materials) increases. According to selectivity-contact time
plots shown in Fig. S10(b), we can conclude that catalytic transfor-
mations of propene should play the most signiﬁcant role, while
gas-phase reactions are less important. Extrapolation of the selec-
tivity to coke over t-ZrO2 to zero propane conversion or zero
contact time gives values close to zero. The corresponding value
for m-ZrO2 is about 10% and is independent of propane conversion.
For all materials, a near to zero selectivity to cracking products will
be achieved when
the conversion approaches
to zero. The
selectivity-conversion dependences can be interpreted as follows.
Propene is formed directly from propane and then undergoes con-
secutive transformations. They include formation of carbon depos-
its over t-ZrO2 and cracking products over all ZrO2 samples (Fig. 5).
Coke formation over m-ZrO2 mainly occurs with participation of
propane or its surface intermediates also leading to propene.
The slope of the selectivity-conversion plot for propene is repre-
sentative for the ability of ZrO2 for consecutive conversion of this
oleﬁn. The steeper the slope, the higher the conversion is. Under
this consideration, m-ZrO2 shows the lowest ability for undesired
propene transformations in comparison with t-ZrO2 samples. The
selectivity to propene over m-ZrO2 decreases from 90% to 83% with
an increase in propane conversion from 9% to 33%. Among the t-
ZrO2 materials, their ability for secondary propene conversion
increases with an increase in the size of crystallites. The selectivity
to propene over t-ZrO2 at propane conversion above 10% was lower
than over m-ZrO2. The main difference between the catalysts is
related to propene conversion into carbon deposits, while phase
composition and/or crystallite size do not seem to affect the ability
of ZrO2 materials for propene conversion into cracking products.

Taking into account the dependence of the selectivity to these
products on modiﬁed contact time (Fig. S10(c)), one can conclude
that they are mainly formed through catalytic transformations of
propene. In addition, as shown in our recent study on PDH over
m-ZrO2 [26], the selectivity to cracking products becomes lower
when the catalysts were reduced in CO instead of H2 before the
PDH reaction. If non-catalytic reactions played a decisive role,
the selectivity would not depend on the kind of reducing agent.
From our previous study [26], the selectivity to coke over
m-ZrO2 was found to depend on the size of crystallites in a similar
way as for t-ZrO2 in the present study. From a mechanistic view-
point, coke originated both from propane and propene, with the
former pathway being dominated over m-ZrO2 with 9.1 nm crys-
tallites (the sample with the smallest crystallites of m-ZrO2). The
propane aided pathways can be easily understood when assuming
that surface intermediates originated from propane can desorb
yielding gas-phase propene or interact with each other forming
coke. The contribution of each pathway to overall coke formation
may, however, depend on the size of crystallites and the kind of
ZrO2 phase. According to DFT calculations, desorption of propene
formed from propane is easier from t-ZrO2 than from m-ZrO2
(0.07 vs. 0.46 eV (Fig. 1)). Thus, in comparison with t-ZrO2, propene
adsorbed on m-ZrO2 may have longer residence time on the sur-
face before escaping to gas phase and accordingly higher probabil-
ity to react with other adsorbed propene molecule(s). This may be
a reason for the dominance of apparent propane-aided pathway of
coke formation over m-ZrO2 with 9.1 nm crystallites.
3.4. Active sites and factors affecting their formation
As shown in the preceding section, m-ZrO2 revealed higher
activity in PDH than t-ZrO2, although DFT calculations predict that
there is no difference between these phases in terms of the kind of
active sites and the highest barrier in the course of propane dehy-
drogenation. The below discussion is focused on identifying possi-
ble
reason(s)
of
such
apparent
discrepancy
between
the
experiment and the theory. Firstly, we measured overall activation
energy of propene formation over differently structured ZrO2
materials in the temperature range from 500 to 550 C. Since cat-
alytically active Zrcus sites can be formed during reductive treat-
ment of ZrO2, the catalysts were always reduced at the highest
reaction temperature (550 C) before performing the PDH reaction
to exclude the effect of reduction temperature on the concentra-
tion of such sites. The rate of propene formation was measured
at 500, 525 and 550 C and propane conversion was below 10%.
The obtained activation energy (Ea) values and the corresponding
Arrhenius plots for m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2 with different size of crys-
tallites are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S11 respectively. Regardless
of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJmol1.
The similarity between differently structured ZrO2 in terms of
experimentally determined Ea values suggests that the kind of
the active site does not depend on catalyst phase composition. It
can be composed of two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy
as concluded from DFT calculations.
Under the above considerations, the different activity of t-ZrO2
and m-ZrO2 as well as t-ZrO2 with different size of crystallites may
be related to the number of active sites, i.e. the ability of ZrO2 to
generate Zrcus. To verify this idea we tried to quantify such sites
in the catalysts from Fig. 4(a). To this end, we performed CO-TPR
tests with the purpose to determine the amount of lattice oxygen
removed from ZrO2. When lattice oxygen is removed, an oxygen
vacancy is formed. As a consequence, the neighboring zirconium
cations will become coordinatively unsaturated. Thus, the amount
of removed oxygen species should reﬂect the ability of ZrO2 to
generate Zrcus sites upon reductive catalyst treatment before start-
ing the PDH reaction.
According to the CO-TPR results (Fig. 3(b)), different ZrO2 cata-
lysts possess different reducibility. They differ in the amount of
released lattice oxygen as well as in the temperature of maximal
rate of oxygen removal. As this amount correlates with the concen-
tration of generated Zrcus sites, a correlation between the rate of
propene formation and the concentration of removed oxygen spe-
cies can exist if Zrcus is responsible for propane activation. Indeed,
the rate of propene formation nearly linearly increases with the
amount of CO consumed in the temperature range from 400 to
900 C (Fig. 7(a)), however, there are two catalysts with smaller
crystallite size stay outside of the ﬁtting line, which maybe
explained under assumption that the defective sites, such as cor-
ners, edges and steps, couldn’t be characterized by CO-TPR but still
active for propane dehydrogenation. Similar dependences are also
valid when the amount of removed oxygen was determined by
integrating the CO-TPR proﬁles between 400 and 600 C or
between 400 and 700 C (Fig. S12). The established relationships
strongly suggest that Zrcus site are active in the PDH reaction over
ZrO2 and their concentration depends on the ability of ZrO2 to
release its lattice oxygen during reductive catalyst treatment.
From our previous study, it was found that bare m-ZrO2 is an
ionic conductor and the smaller the crystallite size, the higher
the conductivity is. This was explained by higher concentration
of anion vacancies or/and easier diffusion of lattice oxygen in smal-
ler crystallite size samples [26]. So, we also performed electrical
conductivity tests with t-ZrO2 catalysts at 550 C in air and N2
for semi-quantitative analysis of the number of bulk anion vacan-
cies. Table S4 shows the conductivity value of selected catalysts at
different oxygen partial pressure at 550 C. As the conductivity val-
ues are quite similar under different oxygen partial pressure, it was
concluded that ionic conductivity dominates in all t-ZrO2 samples.
The effect of phase composition and of the size of ZrO2 crystallites
on the conductivity is shown in Fig. S13. Regardless of the kind of
ZrO2 phase, the conductivity increased with a decrease in the size.
It is also worth mentioning that PDH activity of ZrO2 strongly cor-
relates with the conductivity. As seen in Fig. 7(b) the rate of pro-
pene formation increases linearly with rising conductivity. The
electrical conductivity data are also in accordance with the results
of CO-TPR tests. The higher the reducibility, the easier the oxygen
anions move and thus the higher the ionic conductivity is. Thus,
these results further support the importance of Zrcus for propane
dehydrogenation and prove that the concentration of such sites
depends on the kind of ZrO2 phase and the size of crystallites.

3.5. Crystallite size and phase composition effects on coking behaviour
After establishing the factors governing the activity of differ-
ently structured ZrO2 in PDH, we turn our discussion to the funda-
mentals affecting the selectivity to propene and coke (Fig. 4(b), (c)).
With this purpose, we initially determined an overall rate of pro-
pane conversion into coke (r(coke)/mmolg1
catmin1) at a propane
conversion of about 15% (8.5% for t-ZrO2_4). The rate was calculated
according to Eq. (10). For both m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2, the rate increases
with a decrease in the size of crystallites (Fig. 8(a)). Nevertheless, the
selectivity to coke decreases too. Such obvious inconsistency can be
explained as follows. The coke selectivity is deﬁned as the ratio of
the rate of propane conversion into coke to the overall rate of pro-
pane consumption (Eq. (11)).

where xin(C3H8) is the molar fraction of propane in the reaction
feed, Ffeed is the total ﬂow of C3H8/N2 mixture (mLmin1).
Since the rate of formation of cracking products is very low, the
selectivity to coke is mostly reﬂected by the ratio of the rate of pro-
pene formation to the rate of coke formation (r(C3H6)/r(coke)).
Fig. 8(b) shows the dependence of r(C3H6)/r(coke) on the size of
crystallites of different ZrO2 materials. It is obvious that this ratio
is signiﬁcantly larger than 1 and decreases with the size. As this
ratio is sensitive to structural characteristics of ZrO2, we can con-
clude that active sites for propene formation and coke formation
are different. Furthermore, this relationship provides us hints for
improving the selectivity to propene with a simultaneous decrease
in the selectivity to coke. Another important conclusion from Fig. 8
(b) is related to the effect of the kind of ZrO2 phase on the ratio of
r(C3H6)/r(coke), which is in general higher for m-ZrO2 than for
t-ZrO2 and moreover decreases less pronounced with an increase
in crystallite size. This conclusion is also valid for other degrees
of propane conversion (Fig. S14) thus supporting its generality.
Furthermore, operando UV–vis tests were used to investigate
the formation of coke species during PDH reaction over t-ZrO2 cat-
alysts with crystallite size of 3.7, 4.6 or 5.7 nm and over m-ZrO2
with 9.1, 13.0 or 43.4 nm crystallites. For all these catalysts, an ini-
tial propane conversion was between 5% and 12% and the selectiv-
ity to propene varied from 80% to 100% (Fig. S15). The obtained
UV–vis spectra of three t-ZrO2 samples in form of the relative
Kubelka-Munk function (F(Rrel) are shown in Fig. 9(a–c). F(Rrel)
increased with time on propane stream across the entire range of
wavelengths as a consequence of formation of coke species.
Absorption bands with the maxima at about 300, 420, 600 and
750 nm can be tentatively identiﬁed in the UV–vis spectra of
ZrO2 under PDH conditions. The latter two bands can be ascribed
to polyaromatic graphitic species [43]. It is clearly seen in Fig. 9
(a–c) that the relative ratio of the intensity of absorption bands
in higher absorbing wavelength range to that of lower absorbing
wavelength increases with increasing crystallite size. This means
that the larger the size of t-ZrO2 crystallites, the higher the fraction
of polyaromatic graphitic species is. This conclusion is also applica-
ble to m-ZrO2 samples (Fig. S16). To derive further mechanistic
insights into coke formation, we analyze changes in the UV–vis
spectra with rising time on stream under PDH conditions. Tempo-
ral changes of F(Rrel) at 300, 420, 600, or 750 nm are given in
Fig. S17. As expected F(Rrel) at all the wavelengths increased with
time on stream thus proving that carbon deposits are continuously
formed. Some details about this process can be obtained from ana-
lyzing temporal evolution of the ratio of F(Rrel) at 750 nm to that at
300 nm (F(Rrel)750/F(Rrel)300). This ratio is given in Fig. 9(d) and
qualitatively represents the relative fraction of polyaromatic and
less polymerized species. For all materials, this ratio is well below
1 within a few ﬁrst minutes on propane stream and then increases
with the rising time. Such dependence can be understood when
assuming that coke precursors (seeds) composed of a few propene
molecules are initially formed. Due to their low oligomerization
degree, they should absorb light in UV range. Such precursors
can further react with propene or surface propane fragments to
yield higher oligomerized carbon-containing deposits absorbing
visible light. As seen in Fig. 9(d), the F(Rrel)750/F(Rrel)300 ratio
increases with an increase in the size of ZrO2 crystallites and its
temporal changes are also faster. In other words, larger crystallites
favor formation of polyaromatic graphitic coke, low aggregated
coke precursor is also formed on smaller crystallite size catalysts.
On the basis of the above discussion, the size effect on coke for-
mation can be explained as follows. As the ratio of r(C3H6)/r(coke)
increases with a decrease in the size of ZrO2 crystallites, it is rea-
sonable to suggest that there are at least two different active sites
for propane/propene adsorption and further reaction. One type is
Zrcus sites, which are active for propene formation (Fig. 1) and
may also form coke but with a signiﬁcantly lower rate in compar-
ison with the rate of propene formation. Another type might be
regular surface Zr cations, which can adsorb propene and catalyze

conductivity in air over ZrO2 materials from Fig. 2(a).

its oligomerization. When keeping in mind that ZrO2 reducibility
increases with a decrease in the size of crystallites (Table 1), the
ratio of Zcus/Zr will also increase. Thus, the concentration of regular
sites decreases and consequently a probability of interaction
between several adsorbed propylene to form heavier hydrocarbons
being coke precursor lowers too. It is also worth mentioning that
the rate of coke formation related to catalyst surface area, in gen-
eral, increases with a decrease in the size of crystallites in a
similar way as the rate related to catalyst amount (Fig. S18 and
Fig.
S14(a–c)
respectively).
However,
the
area-related
rate
increases after passing a minimum at the crystallite size of
33 nm. Such behavior is probably related to the fact that the sur-
face fraction of Zrcus in ZrO2 with large crystallites is very low. Reg-
ular surface Zr cations are the dominant species favoring coke
formation. This explanation is indirectly supported by our previous
results on PDH over V-based catalysts [17,44]. Coke formation was
established to depend on the speciation of supported VOx species.
The larger the species, the higher the selectivity to coke was.

4. Conclusions
In this study we demonstrated that the activity of bare ZrO2 and
particularly the selectivity to propene in non-oxidative propane
dehydrogenation can be tuned through the kind of crystal phase
(monoclinic vs. tetragonal) and crystallite size. For both monoclinic
and tetragonal ZrO2, the rate of propene formation was established
to increase with a decrease in the latter parameter. However, mon-
oclinic ZrO2 shows higher activity than tetragonal ZrO2. This was
explained by the fact that the former materials can release their
lattice oxygen easier thus ensure higher concentration of Zrcus.
DFT calculations suggest that two of such sites form the active site
on the surface both of monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 for propane
dehydrogenation. This conclusion was also supported experimen-
tally through establishing correlations between the rate of propene
formation and the amount of lattice oxygen removed in CO-TPR or
the ionic conductivity of ZrO2. Thus, the different PDH activity of
monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 is related to the number of active
Zrcus sites and not to their different intrinsic activity. In addition,
the selectivity to propene over monoclinic ZrO2 was higher than
over tetragonal ZrO2. This was attributed to a higher ratio between
Zrcus sites and those responsible for coke formation. The obtained
fundamentals provide hints for designing ZrO2-based catalysts
with improved activity and may be applied to another metal oxides
previously used or not used for alkane dehydrogenation.
