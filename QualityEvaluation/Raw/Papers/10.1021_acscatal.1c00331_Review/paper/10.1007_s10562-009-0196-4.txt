Abstract
In this study, different oxidation patterns of coke over 3% Pt-Al2O3 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 catalysts were observed but the same catalytic performance was obtained in the dehydrogenation of propane. The oxidation peaks of coke on 3% Pt-Al2O3 appeared at 416 and 513 °C, while only one sharp peak was present at 556 °C in the coke oxidation pattern of 3% Pt-SBA-15. Using the XRD patterns, it was confirmed that the structure of the coke formed over the catalysts was the same. The TPO profiles indicated that the relative distance of coke from the metallic phase (coke location) and the oxygen mobility on each support played important roles in the oxidation of coke.

1 Introduction
Propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction and the conversion is limited by thermodynamics. Commercially viable conversion requires a reaction temperature above 500 °C where catalysts are readily deactivated due to parasitic reactions and coke deposits [1]. For example, even though promoted chromia–alumina and platinum-supported alumina have been developed for industrial applications, coke formation occurs with both catalysts and is a fatal byproduct which accumulates on the catalyst and causes deactivation during the reaction on-stream time [2].
Coke can be removed by gasification with O2, H2O, CO2, and H2. The reaction rates decrease in the order of O2 > H2O > H2 [3]. Typically, coke is oxidized by air in industrial processes such as catalytic cracking, hydrotreating processes, and catalytic reforming [4, 5]. Gasification of coke is affected by several factors including the structure and location of the coke and diffusion limitations [6]. Careful control of the temperature and the oxygen concentration during coke oxidation is critical for suppressing the sintering of the active phase and its loss by reaction with the support [7].
In this article, we report that 3% Pt-Al2O3 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 catalysts demonstrated similar catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation and showed different oxidation patterns of the coke formed during the reaction. Through XRD and TPO measurements, we investigated the factors which influenced coke oxidation in air and suggested the main reasons for the different TPO profiles of coke over the catalysts.
2 Experimental
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
Mesoporous alumina and an SBA-15 support were prepared using CTAB and Pluronic P123 as a template. The detailed procedure can be found elsewhere [8, 9].
The 3% (wt%) platinum loaded onto Al2O3 and SBA-15 supports were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation technique. The precursor (H2PtCl6.6H2O) was dissolved in a solution of 1 M HCl. Then, one aliquot containing 200 μL of precursor was evenly dispersed over calcined Al2O3 and SBA-15. This procedure was repeated until the ratio of liquid to support was 1.0 mL g−1. Catalysts were dried for 24 h at room temperature in a vacuum hood before drying at 100 °C for 12 h in an oven. Calcination was performed at 450 °C for 6 h from room temperature to 450 °C with a ramp of 1 °C min−1. The catalysts were denoted as 3% Pt-Al2O3 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 indicating the metal loading (wt%) on the support. The textural properties of the catalysts are listed in Table 1.

2.2 Catalyst Characterization
2.2.1 Coke Oxidation
Coke oxidation was conducted in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instruments Q50). About 10 mg of spent catalyst was charged into the sample pan and heated to 700 °C at a rate of 40 °C min−1 in flowing air.
2.2.2 Nitrogen Sorption
The isotherms and pore size distributions of the catalysts were characterized by a nitrogen sorption technique (Micromeritics ASAP 2020). The samples were degassed under vacuum at 300 °C for four h prior to analysis and were measured at −196.15 °C using an automatic analyzer. From the desorption data, the pore size distributions were calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model.
2.2.3 Powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
The structures of coke on spent catalysts and free coke were characterized with an XRD technique. The diffraction patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/MAX-2200 powder X-ray diffractometer using a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15418 nm). The X-ray tube was operated at 35 kV, 20 mA, and the two theta angle was scanned from 10 to 100° (step wise 0.02°) at a speed of 2° min−1.
2.3 Reaction Monitoring
Dehydrogenation of propane was performed in a quartz fixed-bed reactor flow system at atmospheric pressure. For all experiments, the catalyst (100 mg) was previously reduced in pure H2 (50 mL min−1) at 600 °C for 2 h followed by purging for 10 min in N2 (100 mL min−1) to remove the H2 remaining in the reactor. Then, the reaction mixture consisting of N2 (100 mL min−1) and C3H8 (30 mL min−1) was fed into the reactor at 600 °C. One minute after the beginning of the reaction, the reaction product mixture was sampled at different intervals and analyzed by gas chromatography (YOUNG LIN-Acme 6000 GC). A flame ionization detector and a 30 m × 0.53 mm HP-PLOT Al2O3 “KCl” capillary column were used.
Propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated by using the following formulae:
$$ {\text{Propane conversion (\% )}} = {\frac{{n({\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} )_{\text{in}} - n({\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} )_{\text{out}} }}{{n({\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} )_{\text{in}} }}} \times 100 $$
$$ {\text{Propylene selectivity (\% )}} = {\frac{{n({\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 6} )}}{{n({\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} )_{\text{in}} - n({\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} )_{\text{out}} }}} \times 100 $$
where n(C3H8)in and n(C3H8)out is the moles of propane from inlet and outlet, respectively; n(C3H6) is the moles of propylene formed from outlet.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Catalyst Performance
After reacting on-stream for 160 min, the propane conversion and propene selectivity were calculated and are shown in Fig. 1. The initial conversions of propane over 3% Pt-Al2O3 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 were 52.7 and 48.1%, respectively. However, the catalysts showed fast deactivation after prolonged reaction and the final conversion was 3.8% on both catalysts. The initial selectivity of propene on 3% Pt-SBA-15 (68.9%) was higher than that on 3% Pt-Al2O3 (51.9%). This is due to the fact that the acidity and propane hydrogenolysis on Pt-Al2O3 is higher than that on Pt-SBA-15 [10]. However, the trends of the selectivity of both catalysts were very similar to each other except for the starting points. This observation indicates that, in the case of Pt-based catalysts, the support does not have a notable effect on the catalytic performance, especially on the stability of catalysts.

3.2 TPO Profiles of Coke Oxidation
TPO profiles of spent 3% Pt-Al2O3 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 catalysts as a function of the on-stream time are shown in Fig. 2. Two successive peaks were observed in the TPO profiles of 3% Pt-Al2O3. However, only one peak was identified in the TPO profiles of 3% Pt-SBA-15. The oxidation temperatures of the first and second peaks in the TPO profiles of 3% Pt-Al2O3 were 465 and 513 °C (at the shoulder), respectively, whereas the oxidation temperature in the TPO profiles of 3% Pt-SBA-15 was 556 °C.

The positions of the peaks in the TPO profiles of each catalyst remain at nearly the same oxidation temperatures over the range of on-stream times. Because coke with a high H/C ratio has a lower oxidation temperature than coke with a low H/C ratio, coke deposited on both catalysts was very condensed and unable to dehydrogenate further.
XRD was used to determine the structures of the coke on both of the spent catalysts and the patterns are presented in Fig. 3. The crystalline phases were identified by comparing the XRD patterns to ICDD standards (PDF numbers: γ-alumina: 29-1486 and platinum: 04-0802). The coke phase on 3% Pt-Al2O3 was detected at 2θ = 25° (d (002) = 3.56 Å) while it was overlapped with the amorphous silica phase in 3% Pt-SBA-15.

To clearly observe the phases of the coke generated on both catalysts in the XRD patterns, dissolution of the Al2O3 and SBA-15 supports (after 160 min on-stream) was performed and the XRD patterns of the liberated coke from both catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. The dissolution technique consisted of treating the coked samples at room temperature with a solution of 40% hydrofluoric acid to dissolve the supports and to liberate the coke. This method has been validated by P. Magnoux who obtained an unchanged coke structure after treatment [11]. It can be seen that the (002) peaks at 25° on both of the liberated coke samples were very broad and their d-spacing values (~3.56 Å) were slightly larger than that of pure graphite (d (002) = 3.35 Å [12]).

The TPO profiles of both of the liberated cokes were monitored and are shown in Fig. 5. Interestingly, the same oxidation temperature (420 °C) was obtained for both librated cokes. From the XRD patterns and TPO profiles of the liberated cokes, we suggest that the cokes on both catalysts have the similar structure and are composed of very weakly crystallized turbostratic carbon. The different oxidation temperatures obtained from the TPO profiles of the 3% Pt-Al2O3 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 were not due to the coke structure which was determined by the XRD patterns and TPO profiles to be identical.

To investigate the influence of diffusion limitations on the oxidation temperature of coke, 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 and 3% Pt-SiO2 catalysts having different pore sizes were prepared and deactivated under the same reaction conditions. The pore diameters of spent 3% Pt-Al2O3, spent 3% Pt-SBA-15, spent 3% Pt-Al2O3-1, and spent 3% Pt-SiO2 were 7.53, 3.67, 4.59, and 1.0 nm, respectively (Table 1). The mean free path of air is 69 nm at room temperature [13]. Therefore, air diffusion into the pores is affected by Knudsen diffusion during the oxidation process of all of the spent catalysts with pore diameters being smaller than 69 nm. However, the TPO profiles (Fig. 6) of the spent 3% Pt-Al2O3, 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 or 3% Pt-SBA-15, 3% Pt-SiO2 have the same oxidation temperatures. This observation implies that the influence of the pore sizes of the spent catalysts on air diffusion during the oxidation process does not shift the oxidation temperature of coke.

Carbons (graphitic and/or amorphous) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (difficult to distinguish from carbons) are produced from Pt and acidic sites, respectively. Besides the property of reactants and reaction conditions, extent and rate of coke formation are also dependent on acidity and pore structure of the supports. Generally, rate and extent of coke formation increase with increasing acidic strength and concentration; coke yield diminishes with decreasing pore size [14].
In our findings, pore size affected mainly on coke yield when the coke amount (%wt/wt at TOS = 160 min) decreases in the following orders: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6) and 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5). However, influence of acidity is not easy to verify because the coke amount is limited by pore size.
We proposed that the different oxidation temperatures of coke in the TPO profiles of spent 3% Pt-Al2O3 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 catalyst results from the different locations of coke on each catalyst. Pt metal plays the role of catalyst in soot oxidation, and the oxidation temperature of soot shifted significantly to a lower temperature [15]. The extent of the decrease of the oxidation temperature depends on the extent of the direct physical contact between platinum and soot particles (loose contact, tight contact, or intimate contact). Compared to loose or tight contact, intimate contact was found to result in the lowest oxidation temperature of soot [16–18]. In direct physical contact, the catalyst itself may activate the carbon atoms or act as a renewable, activated oxygen donor [19].
Without physical contact (indirect contact), Pt in supported catalysts can dissociate oxygen, and the activated oxygen species can immigrate onto the support of the coke particle where it reacts as if it was in a non-catalytic reaction. This phenomenon is called the spillover effect [20].
After removing the Al2O3 and the SBA-15 supports, the liberated coke consisted of coke and Pt metal because Pt metal does not dissolve in the HF solution [21]. The oxidation temperatures of both liberated cokes were lower than that of the coke on each catalyst prior to removing the support. This means that coke did not form an intimate contact with Pt during deposition. The oxidation temperature of coke before removing the supports should be equal to or lower than that of the liberated coke if the contact between Pt and coke was intimate. In fact, on the 3% Pt-Al2O3 catalyst, the coke was located mainly on the Pt-Al2O3 boundary and on the Al2O3 support. The coke on the Pt-Al2O3 boundary had a lower oxidation temperature (465 °C) than did the coke on the Al2O3 support (513 °C). The coke on the Pt-Al2O3 boundary was catalyzed by Pt via direct contact and the spillover effect, while the coke on the Al2O3 support was only catalyzed by Pt via the spillover effect. The coke on 3% Pt-SBA-15 had a higher oxidation temperature (556 °C) than that on 3% Pt-Al2O3, was located far from the Pt sites, and was probably catalyzed by Pt via the spillover effect.
Moreover, the mobility of activated oxygen species on the surface of oxides plays an important role in the spillover effect, and mobile oxygen species are much more reactive than O2 in the gas phase [19]. It was found that the mobility of activated oxygen species (at 400 °C) on the surface of Al2O3 was approximately 60 times higher than that on SiO2. Furthermore, above 400 °C, bulk oxygen diffusion can only be observed on Al2O3 [22]. It has been suggested that there is a relationship between oxygen exchange on the oxide surface and oxidation reactions [23]. The catalytic oxidation of soot was studied over several metal oxides and the oxidation temperature followed the following trend: TiO2 < V2O5 < CuO ≈ Fe2O3 [15]. The influence of the composition of HY zeolite on the removal of coke in pure oxygen was examined in a previous study where it was found that the oxidation temperature increased when the framework Si/Al ratio increased. The measured oxidation temperatures of coke on zeolite with Si:Al = 3.9 and 100 were 430 and 490 °C, respectively [24]. These results can be related to the temperature range of oxygen exchange which shows the following trend: TiO2 (530–600 °C) > V2O5 (450–500 °C) > CuO (250–350 °C) ≈ Fe2O3 (253–348 °C), and SiO2 (650–900 °C) > γ-Al2O3 (460–800 °C). The lower the temperature of the oxygen exchange, the greater the surface mobility of the oxides [22, 23]. Hence, the influence of the spillover effect should be accounted for to explain the difference in the oxidation temperatures of coke located on Al2O3 (513 °C) and that on SBA-15 (556 °C) observed in our experiments.
4 Conclusions
The oxidation temperature of coke over a catalyst depended on the coke location, the nature of the supports, and was related to the mobility of oxygen on the surface and in the bulk of the supports. On 3% Pt-Al2O3, coke was located primarily on both the metal-support boundary and the support, while coke was located mainly on the support in the case of 3% Pt-SBA-15. The oxidation of coke located near metallic sites was catalyzed, resulting in an oxidation peak at a lower temperature. However, the oxidation of coke located far from metallic sites was controlled by oxygen mobility which results from the nature of the supports. The mobility of activated oxygen species on the surface of Al2O3 was much higher than that of SiO2. This is the reason why the oxidation peak of coke on the Al2O3 support appeared at a lower temperature than on the SiO2 support. The results of the present study are useful for designing catalysts for propane dehydrogenation including catalyst regeneration, as the regeneration temperature of spent catalysts is critical to prevent catalysts from sintering.
