VOX-doped porous SiO2 solids (VOX-SiO2) were synthesized at different gelation and calcination temper-
atures through an in-situ one-step synthesis and evaluated by non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation
(PDH), exhibiting excellent catalytic performance. VOX-SiO2 catalysts were characterized by XRD, low-
temperature N2 adsorption/desorption, SEM, TEM, UV–Vis, Raman, XPS, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, and TGA.
The structural and performance results for the catalysts reveal that gelation temperature has only a slight
effect on the surface acidity, textural properties and VOX species dispersion of VOX-SiO2 catalysts within a
reasonable temperature range (30–60 C). The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, with a gelation temperature of
60 C, a calcination temperature of 580 C, and prepared by the one-step synthesis method, obviously
shortens gelation process time by half compared to catalyst gelled at 30 C and exhibits superior catalytic
performance for PDH. Over high gelation temperature (75 C) leads to the loss of integrity and decreases
catalytic activity of the VOX-SiO2 catalysts. Compared with the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst prepared by a one-
step hydrothermal method, VOX-SiO2 catalysts exhibit better catalytic activity and stability. Importantly,
at a reaction temperature of 580 C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term cat-
alytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow
decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approxi-
mately 91%. The results of this work will be beneﬁcial for further industrial development and application
of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis.

1. Introduction
Lower oleﬁns are essential petrochemical intermediates, espe-
cially propene, which is widely used as a feedstock in the produc-
tion of a variety of chemicals. Propene is mainly produced by steam
cracking and ﬂuid catalytic cracking (FCC) [1–4]. Besides these two
approaches, catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) is an attractive alter-
native with the rapidly growing demand for propene and its
derivatives [5–8]. DH processes can be classiﬁed into non-
oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of pro-
pane (ODHP). Although the latter (ODHP) has many advantages,
such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and
decreasing carbon deposition, the ODHP process unavoidably gen-
erates by-products due to deep oxidation of propene [9,10]. Non-
oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in
commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are fre-
quently used [11,12]. Given the price and deactivation disadvan-
tages
of
both
catalysts,
especially
the
pollution
problem
associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate
novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts [13–
15].
V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to
Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH [16], are reasonably
priced and environmentally friendly. In previous studies, these cat-
alysts have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reac-
tions
[17–22].
Moreover,
catalyst
performance
was
strongly
affected when different supports, such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3,
were used [23,24]. To the authors’ knowledge, the use of Al2O3
and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts,
which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH [23,25–28].
Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chem-
istry of mesoporous c-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where

the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability
[27]. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and cat-
alyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3
catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of
V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic prop-
erties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the
absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxida-
tive regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high sta-
bility of VOX species [23,25,26]. Rodemerck et al. also reported a
relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in
the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior cat-
alytic properties for PDH [28]. Hence, it can be concluded that V-
based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial
PDH process.
A mesoporous silica monolith has been reported and possesses
superior textural properties, but needs a lengthy gelation period at
room temperature (at least six weeks) [29,30]. Fortunately, Yang
et al. shortened the solvent evaporation process by using a
liquid-parafﬁn medium to seal the ethanol solution, meaning that
the prepared silica monolith can exactly copy the shape of the
reactor [31]. They also proposed a one-step method to synthesize
silica monoliths by doping various nanocrystals and found that
the prepared materials had potential catalytic applications, but
that vanadium species were not included [32].
Taking inspiration from the preparation and applications of
mesoporous
silica
monoliths,
the
authors
have
prepared
vanadium-doped porous silica solids (VOX-SiO2) by a one-step syn-
thesis in this study. The preparation method is environmentally-
friendly, without loss of the VOX precursor. The inﬂuence of gela-
tion and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic
performance of VOX-SiO2 catalysts for PDH reaction was studied
in detail. The prepared VOX-SiO2 catalysts were characterized using
a variety of state-of-the-art techniques and evaluated by a non-
oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of porous VOX-SiO2 solids
Porous VOX-SiO2 solids were prepared by an in-situ one-step
synthesis [32]. Catalyst preparation was performed as follows.
NH4VO3
(0.14 g,
99.95%,
Aladdin)
was
dissolved
in
ethanol
(10.00 g, Shanghai Chemical Agent Co. Ltd (China)) under mechan-
ical stirring. Subsequently, anhydrous oxalic acid (0.14 g, 98%,
Aladdin) was added to promote dissolution of NH4VO3, and the
mixed solutions were stirred for 30 min at 40 C. When the mix-
ture was cooled to room temperature, 2.00 g of triblock copoly-
mers P123 (EO20PO70EO20, average Mn = 5800, Aladdin) was
added and stirred until well mixed; 4.32 g of TEOS (tetraethoxysi-
lane, 99.99%, Aladdin) and 0.40 g of aqueous HCl solution (0.8 M,
Shanghai Chemical Agent Co. Ltd (China)) were slowly dripped into
the mixture and stirred to dissolve them completely. Then the pel-
lucid solution was poured into a porcelain crucible and heated
under different temperatures (30 C, 45 C, 60 C, 75 C, and 90
C) to form a silica gel. The prepared gel was sealed by a liquid-
parafﬁn medium (Aladdin) and heated at 60 C for 18 h to remove
most of the ethanol and to form a rigid silica solid. Afterwards, the
liquid-parafﬁn was captured on ﬁlter paper and collected for reuse.
Finally, the obtained materials were calcined at 580 C for 6 h
under air atmosphere to remove P123 from the silica solids. The
resulting catalysts of porous VOX-SiO2 solids (VOX-SiO2) with dif-
ferent
gelation
temperatures
(recorded
as
GT-VOX-SiO2-580)
denoted as 30-VOX-SiO2-580, 45-VOX-SiO2-580, 60-VOX-SiO2-580,
75-VOX-SiO2-580, and 90-VOX-SiO2-580, respectively, where the
content of doping V is 5 wt%. Before the catalytic test, the catalysts
were crushed and then tested in powder form due to the limits of
the actual PDH reactor (8 mm inner diameter). As gelation temper-
ature increased, the gelation process time gradually became
shorter, as shown in Fig. 1. By the same preparation process, pure
silica solid (SiO2) was synthesized at a gelation temperature of 30
C and a calcination temperature of 580 C. In addition, the cata-
lysts with a gelation temperature of 60 C were calcined at temper-
atures (recorded as 60-VOX-SiO2-CT) of 550 C, 580 C, 620 C, and
650 C. These catalysts were denoted as 60-VOX-SiO2-550, 60-VOX-
SiO2-580, 60-VOX-SiO2-620, and 60-VOX-SiO2-650, respectively.
For comparison, VOX-MCM-41 was also synthesized by a one-
step hydrothermal method. A certain amount of NH4VO3 was dis-
solved in deionized water (10.0 g) under mechanical stirring to dis-
solve it completely. CTAB (1.7 g) and NaOH (0.27 g) were dissolved
in deionized water (100.0 g) as a template solution. The NH4VO3
solution was added to the template solution under mechanical stir-
ring for 30 min. Then TEOS (10.5 g) was added dropwise to the
mixed solution under stirring at 60 C for 4 h. The synthesized
gel was cooled overnight. Afterwards, it was transferred into a
Teﬂon-lined autoclave and aged at 120 C for 48 h. The obtained
materials were washed ﬁve times with deionized water (750 ml)
and dried at 60 C for 12 h. Finally, it was calcined at 550 C for
4 h to form a V-MCM-41 sample, where the content of V is 5 wt%
according to the ICP result.
2.2. Characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was collected on a Bragg-
Brentano diffractometer (monochromatic Cu Ka radiation, k =
1.5418 Å). The catalysts were scanned from 10 to 70 (2h value)
using a scan speed of 5/min at 40 kV and 30 mA. The vanadium
and silicon contents of the catalysts were obtained with induc-
tively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES)
with Varian Vista MPX. Low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorp-
tion isotherms were measured using a NOVA4000 analyzer (Quan-
tachrome, USA) at 77 K. Before analysis, the catalysts were
degassed under vacuum at 300 C for 4 h. The multipoint BET
method was utilized to calculate the surface areas. The pore vol-
umes of the catalysts were obtained at the maximum relative pres-
sure (P/P0). The pore size distributions of the catalysts were
derived from the desorption branch of the isotherms using the
BJH model. For micropore analysis, the pore volume and pore

diameter of catalysts were measured by DFT method and V-t
method (t-plot Method Micropore Analysis). Morphological prop-
erties of the catalysts were determined using an S-4800 ﬁeld emis-
sion scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) at 5.0 kV. XPS spectra
were performed on a Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA using an Al
Ka source. The binding energy (BE) was detected with the C1s level
at 284.9 eV as a reference. Raman spectra were collected using a
Jobin Yvon confocal laser Raman spectrometer (SuperLabRam II)
with a 632.8 nm He–Ne ion laser beam. Before measurements,
the catalysts were dried at 100 C for 5 h. The spectra were
acquired within 20 s by three accumulations. H2-TPR experiments
were carried using an autosorb-iQ Instruments with a thermal con-
duction detector (TCD) (Quantachrome, USA). The powered cata-
lysts (60 mg) were added to a U-shape quartz tube reactor and
supported with quartz wool. Prior to measurements, the catalysts
were treated with an Ar ﬂow (15 ml/min) at 500 C for 1 h. Then
the catalysts were reduced under a mixture gas of 10% H2 and
90% (v/v) Ar from room temperature to 800 C (10 C/min). NH3-
TPD investigations were carried out on a TP-5080 adsorption
instrument to evaluate surface acidity. Before NH3-TPD analysis,
catalysts (0.1 g) were pretreated for 1 h at 400 C with a 30 ml/
min of He ﬂow. When cooling to 120 C, high puriﬁed NH3 (20
ml/min, 99.9999%) was adsorbed and saturated over all the acid
sites for 30 min. Afterwards, the catalysts were blown for another
45 min to remove the physical absorption of NH3. During desorp-
tion, the analysis was performed from 120 to 600 C (10 C/min).
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the spent catalysts was per-
formed with a DTG-60H analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan) in an air atmo-
sphere to evaluate coke deposition. The measurement was carried
out from 50 C to 800 C (10 C/min) in a ceramic crucible as a
reference.
2.3. Catalytic tests of PDH
Catalytic tests of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
(PDH) were carried out with a continuous-ﬂow ﬁxed-bed quartz
reactor under atmospheric pressure. Catalysts in powder form
(0.3 g, average particle size: around 0.25 mm) were ﬁlled into the
center of the reactor and supported with ﬂuffy quartz wool. An axi-
ally movable thermocouple was placed into a quartz capillary to
measure the reaction temperature. After ﬁlling catalyst, the reactor
was heated to 580 C (10 C/min) under an Ar ﬂow of 15 ml/min.
Then, a mixture of propane/Ar with a volume ratio of 1:10 was
fed to the reactor with a ﬂow rate of 16.5 ml/min at STP (4.05 
103 mol/h, 3300 cm3 g1 cat h1). Products of PDH were analyzed
using a gas chromatography (GC, SP-6980) equipped with a FID
chromatographic detector. The conversion of propane and selectiv-
ity of propene were calculated with a carbon atom balance method
by the following formulas as:
C3H8 conversion ¼ C3H8in  C3H8out
C3H8in
ð1Þ
C3H6 selectivity ¼
C3H6out
C3H8in  C3H8out
ð2Þ
C3H6 yield ¼ C3H6out
C3H8in
ð3Þ
where C3H8in and C3H8out were related to the feed and product
ﬂows of propane respectively; C3H6out was the product ﬂow of
propene.
The turnover frequency (TOF, s1) value per V species was cal-
culated as:
TOFi ¼ nA0  XA
nV
ð4Þ
where nA0 is the molar ﬂow rate of propane feed (mol/s), XA is the
conversion of propane per gram of sample and nV is the moles of
V per gram of sample.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performances of catalysts in PDH
Fig. 2 shows the catalytic performance of VOX-SiO2 catalysts cal-
cined at 580 C with different gelation temperatures. The propane
conversion and propene yield slowly decrease with reaction time
for all catalysts during a 6 h reaction duration. The decrease in cat-
alytic activity could be explained by the formation of coke, which
covers part of the active sites of VOX species during the DH reaction
[33,34]. The propane selectivity maintains a relatively stable value,
but shows a slight increase at higher gelation temperatures, which
is the opposite of the variation in propane conversion. The results
demonstrate that lower propane conversion of the catalyst results
in low propene partial pressure and consequently lower reaction
rates in the cracking and coke reactions. Among these catalysts,
the highest initial propane conversion (65%) was obtained from
the 30-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, whereas the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 cata-
lyst shows the poorest catalytic properties. The propane conver-
sion
of
pure
SiO2
material
is
about
5%
(Fig.
S-1).
More
speciﬁcally, VOX-SiO2 catalysts prepared at gelation temperatures
below 60 C exhibit superior catalytic performance in terms of pro-
pane conversion, propene selectivity, and propene yield. The pro-
pene
yield
decreases
slightly
with
increasing
gelation
temperature, but a similar yield is achieved after 4 h reaction. This
phenomenon can also be observed in the TOF values of catalysts
with different gelation temperatures in Table 1. When the catalyst
is prepared above 60 C gelation temperature, the catalytic perfor-
mance obviously decreases, especially in the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 cat-
alyst. As a result, the catalyst gelled at 60 C shortens the gelation
process time by half compared to the catalyst gelled at 30 C
(Fig. 1), but both achieve similar catalytic yields after 4 h reaction.
In addition, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits a lower deacti-
vation rate, in agreement with the variation in TOF values (Table 1),
where propane conversion and propene yield show a 15% decline
during a 6 h reaction.
Compared with the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst obtained by a one-
step hydrothermal method, VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized by
the in-situ one-step method show markedly superior catalytic per-
formance, except for the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. VOX-MCM-41
achieved 40% initial propane conversion and 79% propene selectiv-
ity, as shown in Fig. 2. The propane conversion of VOX-MCM-41
drops to 17% after 6 h reaction. Note that the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 cat-
alyst shows higher initial propane conversion, propene selectivity,
and catalytic stability than the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst. Xue et al.
also reported the non-oxidation propane dehydrogenation of the
5.2 V-MSNSs catalyst, which obtained 46% initial propane conver-
sion and 80% propene selectivity [35]. Apparently, VOX-SiO2 cata-
lysts
prepared
at
a
gelation
temperature
of
60 C
exhibit
excellent catalytic activity and stability for PDH, which is beneﬁcial
for large-scale industrial experimentation with PDH.
In addition to gelation temperature, calcination temperature is
another crucial factor for synthesizing VOX-SiO2 catalysts and plays
an essential role in the structure and properties of these catalysts
[36]. The catalyst gelled at 60 C was selected as a representative
sample to investigate the inﬂuence of calcination temperature on
catalyst structure and properties. Fig. 3 shows the propane conver-
sion and propene selectivity of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with a gelation
temperature of 60 C at different calcination temperatures. As cal-
cination temperature increases, propane conversion gradually
decreases, but propene selectivity slightly increases. The variation
110

trends of propane conversion and propene selectivity are similar to
those found in other studies [37]. Although the catalyst calcined at
550 C has better initial catalytic activity for PDH, the VOX-SiO2
catalyst calcined at 580 C exhibits superior stability and shows
higher propane conversion after 3 h reaction. The TOF values of
catalysts with different calcination temperatures also indicate this
phenomenon (Table 1). The result may be related to the actual
reaction temperature of 580 C, where the similar calcination tem-

perature makes the catalyst structure more stable. It is noted that
the TOF values and propene selectivity of the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 cat-
alysts are higher than other V-Si materials under similar reaction
conditions (Table 1). The catalysts show superior catalytic activity
and stability for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in
this work. The carbon balance is calibrated with TGA measurement
and elemental analysis, which is provided in Table S-1. It can be
seen that the carbon balance calibration is higher than 98% in this
work. The TGA experiments of V-SiO2 catalysts (coke deposition)
have been also carried out and the results are presented in Fig. S-
2. These results indicate that the mass balance is well-matched.
3.2. Textural properties
Table 2 summarizes the pore size, pore volume, and speciﬁc
surface area of the VOX-SiO2 catalysts, SiO2 solid, and VOX-MCM-
41. Fig. S-3 shows the N2 adsorption/desorption curves of VOX-
SiO2-580 catalysts with different gelation temperatures. It shows
the type-IV sorption isotherms with an H-2 hysteresis loop charac-
teristic of typical inkbottle mesopores for SiO2 solid and VOX-SiO2
catalysts. As gelation temperature increases, the pore volume and
surface area of catalysts decrease, whereas the pore size shows
no obvious variation except for the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst.
The surface area of SiO2 solid is smaller than that of the corre-
sponding
30-VOX-SiO2-580
catalyst,
but
the
pore
size
has
increased, implying that the doped VOX species inﬂuence the struc-
ture of the SiO2 solid. Yang et al. also proposed a similar textural
variation in SnO2/SiO2 catalyst [32]. When the gelation tempera-
ture further increases to 90 C, the catalyst follows a hysteresis
loop at high relative pressure, and the pore size becomes larger,
but the pore volume and surface area are reasonably decreased,
which could occur because the relatively small channels are
blocked by aggregated VOX species [27]. Fig. 4 shows photographs
of VOX-SiO2 solids with different gelation temperatures before and
after calcination. At a gelation temperature of 90 C, it is obvious
that the integrity of the VOX-SiO2 catalyst has been destroyed,
which may be attributed to quick loss of ethanol solvent. Fig. S-4
shows the external proﬁles of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with different
gelation temperatures. The surface of the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst
is smooth and dense, whereas the surface of the catalyst gelled at
75 C is starting to become rough, and small splits have appeared
on the surface. When the gelation temperature increases to 90 C,
the surface of the catalyst becomes uneven, and some visible small
pores (<1 lm) occur on the surface. The result also demonstrates
that VOX-SiO2 catalysts show poor textural properties at over-
high gelation temperatures, which is a signiﬁcant factor in explain-
ing why the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst has the poorest catalytic
performance. Besides, the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst exhibits a type-
IV sorption isotherm with an H-1 hysteresis loop in Fig. S-3 and
shows larger pore volume and surface area, although its pore size
is relatively smaller than that of VOX-SiO2 catalysts. The difference
in textural properties of the catalysts can partially account for the
variations in catalytic performance.
The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of 60-VOX-SiO2 cata-
lysts with different calcination temperatures vary obviously with
increasing temperature and are shown in Fig. S-5. When the calci-
nation temperature is 580 C, the pore volume and surface area of
the catalyst (60-VOX-SiO2-580) decrease slightly compared to the
catalyst at 550 C, as shown in Table 2. The result may provide a
reasonable explanation for the similar catalytic behavior of the cat-
alysts calcined at 550 C and 580 C. However, 60-VOX-SiO2-580
catalyst exhibits relatively better stability at 580 C reaction tem-
perature for PDH, which can be attributed to the more stable struc-
ture of the catalyst calcined at the same temperature. When the
calcination temperature increases to 620 C, the textural properties
of catalyst in terms of pore size, pore volume, and surface area are
poor (Table 2), and the catalyst starts to present a microporous
instead of a mesoporous structure.
3.3. Raman analysis
Fig. 5A presents Raman spectra of VOX-SiO2-580 catalysts,
which show obvious differences with increasing gelation tempera-
ture (from 30 C to 90 C), implying that gelation temperature has a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the distribution of VOX species. The XRD
patterns of the catalysts in Fig. S-6 show no obvious differences.
Raman signals at around 431, 489, and 607 cm1 appear in the
SiO2 solid; the ﬁrst two are attributed to amorphous SiO2, and
the last is related to symmetric SiAOASi stretching vibration
[38]. Besides these similar signals, the 30-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst
shows additional Raman bands at 911 and 1025 cm1 correspond-
ing to VAOASi bond vibration and the stretching vibration of vana-
dyl (O@V) groups of surface VOX species respectively [39–42]. In
particular, the characteristic band at around 1025 cm1 demon-
strates the presence of isolated VOX species with tetrahedral coor-
dination in all VOX-SiO2 catalysts. The result demonstrates that
vanadium oxide is highly dispersed in VOX-SiO2 catalysts. More-
over, the signals at around 271 and 702 cm1 may be ascribed to
the VAOAV bending mode and VAOAV stretching vibrations,
respectively [43,44]. With increasing gelation temperature in the
range of 30–75 C, the intensity of Raman bands at 271, 431, 489,
and 702 cm1 has a slight increasing trend, but the intensity at
around 911 cm1 shows an non-obvious decrease, which may be
related to the gradual aggregation of VOX species on the surfaces
of
VOX-SiO2
catalysts
[35].

higher intensity, and a characteristic peak at 995 cm1 appears,
indicating that crystalline V2O5 is present in the 90-VOX-SiO2-580
catalyst [39,45]. The results imply that VOX-SiO2 catalysts should
be gelled below 75 C to give VOX species better dispersion in
SiO2 solid surfaces. Besides, the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst has an addi-
tional Raman band at 840 cm1, which may be ascribed to the
SiAOH stretching vibrations of surface hydroxyl groups [35]. The
absence of a characteristic peak at 995 cm1 implies that VOX crys-
tallites are not formed in the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst, whereas the
weak band at 911 cm1 indicates a weak interaction between
VOX species and MCM-41, which may indicate high VOX species
coverage on the catalyst surface [46]. Fig. 5B shows the Raman
spectra of 60-VOX-SiO2 catalysts at different calcination tempera-
tures. When the calcination temperature increases to 650 C, the
characteristic peak of crystalline V2O5 at 995 cm1 appears, indi-
cating that over-high calcination temperature will cause the aggre-
gation of more VOX species and even the formation of V2O5
crystallites.
3.4. XPS analysis
To reveal more completely the chemical states of VOX species,
XPS analysis was undertaken; the results are shown in Fig. 6. As
shown in the spectra, the peak of V2p3/2 can be deconvoluted into
two peaks at around 517.6 and 516.6 eV, which can be ascribed to
V5+ and V4+ species respectively [47]. Table 3 presents the V2p3/2 of
VOX-SiO2 catalysts, including peak area fractions and the surface
atomic ratio Si/V. As listed in Table 3, the calculated Si/V molar
ratios of catalysts with different gelation temperatures show no
evident variation with increasing gelation temperature, but the
ratio by XPS is much larger than by ICP (approximately 16%, from
Table 3), suggesting that VOX species are mostly dispersed into the
channels of the SiO2 solids. The XPS analysis also reveals a relation-
ship between the gelation temperature and the state of surface
VOX species. With increasing gelation temperature, V5+ species
on the catalyst surface increase, but V4+ species decrease, suggest-
ing a slight increase in the polymerization degree of VOX species
[48,49]. It is apparent that V4+ species have decreased greatly in
the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, which may be attributed to the
agglomeration of partial VOX species according to Raman results.
Because the gelation temperature at 75 C is close to the boiling
point of ethanol (78.3 C). When approaching or exceeding this
temperature, the structure of VOX-SiO2 solids and dispersion of
VOX species can be seriously inﬂuenced, according to the analysis
of textural properties and XPS results. This analysis can explain
the performance of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with different gelation
temperatures.
Fig. 6B shows the XPS spectra of 60-VOX-SiO2 catalysts with dif-
ferent calcination temperatures. The calculated Si/V molar ratio
(Table 3) evidently decreases with increasing calcination tempera-
ture, indicating that the relative content of surface VOX species in
the catalysts shows an increasing trend with increasing calcination
temperature. However, the V4+ species of the catalyst shows only
slight variation between the 60-VOX-SiO2-550 and 60-VOX-SiO2-
580 catalysts, suggesting that the dispersion of VOX species is not
obviously different. When the calcination temperature increases
to 650 C, the V4+ species show an obvious decrease, indicating
an increase in the aggregation degree of VOX species, in agreement
with the Raman results. Variations in textural properties and the
dispersion of VOX species are crucial factors in catalytic perfor-
mance. Other factors, such as catalyst acidity, also play an impor-
tant role in affecting catalytic behavior and are discussed below.
3.5. NH3-TPD analysis
The surface acidic property of VOX-SiO2 catalysts plays a crucial
role in the dehydrogenation behavior of propane and is detected by
NH3-TPD analysis. Fig. S-7 shows the NH3-TPD proﬁles of VOX-
SiO2-580 catalysts with different gelation temperatures. All the
catalysts show a desorption peak at around 160–190 C, which
can be ascribed to weak acid sites and the presence of monomeric
and low-polymerized VOX species with tetrahedral coordination.
The desorption peak in the 200–260 C range is ascribed to med-
ium acid sites, and other desorption peaks (>260 C) are attributed
to strong acid sites [35,50]. Table 4 shows a semi-quantitative
analysis of NH3-TPD measurements of VOX-SiO2 catalysts using
the Gaussian deconvolution method. As gelation temperature
increases, the peak centers of weak and medium acid sites shift

mm height and optically transparent.

to higher temperatures. The intensity and total number of acid
sites (indicated by total peak area) obviously increase with increas-
ing gelation temperature except for the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst.
This may be due to the increase in polymerization degree of VOX
species based on the earlier analysis [28,51]. When the gelation
temperature increases to 75 C, the peak intensity of weak acid
sites shows an obvious decrease, and consequently the peak inten-
sity of strong acid sites shows a sudden increase, which may be due
to the formation of polymeric or high-polymeric VOX species. This
result can reasonably explain the decrease in propane conversion
with the 75-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. In addition, for the 90-VOX-
SiO2-580 catalyst, the center of the weak-acid site peak occurs at
a higher temperature, and the total number of acid sites markedly
decreases, although the peak intensity of weak acid sites is similar
to that of the catalyst that gelled at 75 C. This result is evident
from the existence of crystalline V2O5 at high gelation temperature
based on the Raman results, which can partially explain why the
90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst has the poorest catalytic behavior for
PDH. However, the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst has less total surface
acidity and a higher peak intensity for medium and strong acid
sites than the VOX-SiO2 catalysts, which may be one of the reasons
for
its
low
catalytic
performance,
especially
the
propene
selectivity.
Fig. S-8 shows the NH3-TPD proﬁles of 60-VOX-SiO2 catalysts
with different calcination temperatures. As calcination tempera-
ture increases, the weak-acid site peak shifts to a higher tempera-
ture, the peak intensity of medium acid sites obviously decreases,
and total surface acidity gradually decreases, indicating an increase
in the polymerization degree of VOX species. This can explain the
variation in catalyst performance with different calcination tem-
peratures. However, the catalysts calcined at 550 C and 580 C

have similar total surface acidity and only a slight variation in
weak acid sites. This implies that they change only slightly with
regard to the dispersion of VOX species, which is in agreement with
XPS results.
3.6. TPR analysis
Fig. 7A shows the H2-TPR patterns of VOX-SiO2-580 catalysts
with different gelation temperatures to reveal the reducibility of
VOX species [50,52]. The VOX-SiO2 catalysts show a reduction peak
in the 527–538 C range at gelation temperatures below 75 C,
which can be ascribed to the reduction of monomeric or low-
polymerized VOX species with tetrahedral coordination [53]. In
addition, the peak position shifts slightly to a higher temperature
as gelation temperature increases (60 C), which indicates a
slight increase in the polymerization degree of VOX species with
increasing gelation temperature and seems to be consistent with
the Raman and NH3-TPD results. When the gelation temperature
increases to 75 C, the intensity of the reduction peaks obviously
decreases, which can be due to polymeric or high-polymeric VOX
species [53]. As the temperature further increases to 90 C, the cat-
alyst structure is destroyed, and crystalline V2O5 is observed.
Therefore, the reduction peak position of the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 cat-
alyst shifts to a higher temperature, and double peaks start to
appear, indicating the presence of V2O5 crystallites, which will
retard reduction [54]. By combining the Raman, XPS, NH3-TPD,
and TPR analyses, it can be readily concluded that the VOX-SiO2
catalyst gelation process may have a proportional gelation-
temperature tipping point. Hence, the structural and catalytic
properties of catalysts may show an obvious change after the tip-
ping point; this point may be at approximately 60 C based on cat-
alytic performance for PDH.
Fig. 7B shows the H2-TPR patterns of VOX species of 60-VOX-
SiO2 catalysts calcinated at different temperatures. A higher calci-
nation temperature induces a higher polymerization degree of VOX
species, leading to a shift in the reduction peaks. Note that the cat-
alysts calcined at 550 C and 580 C exhibit similar reduction
peaks, which is consistent with the Raman and XPS results. There-
fore, they exhibit similar catalytic activity in terms of high propane
conversion. However, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst shows higher
propene selectivity (Fig. 3) due to its higher calcination tempera-
ture, which leads to a more stable catalyst structure.
3.7. Regeneration behavior
Given the catalytic activity and stability of the 60-VOX-SiO2-580
catalyst, this catalyst has been selected for further study of the
long-term stability of dehydrogenation-regeneration (DH) cycles
for PDH. As shown in Fig. 8, propane conversion gradually
decreases to around 45% after the ﬁrst 4 h period, which can pos-
sibly be attributed to deactivation of VOX species by carbon depo-
sition [27]. The propene selectivity remains constant at 91% in
the ﬁrst DH cycle. Moreover, after regeneration with air (10 ml/
min) in situ at 580 C for 30 min, the catalytic performance of each
DH cycle is almost restored. For the eighth cycle test, the propane
conversion maintains an approximately 10% decrease, but the pro-
pene selectivity shows a slight increase compared to the ﬁrst DH
cycle, suggesting that VOX species may be more stable with longer
DH cycle times and that the catalyst possesses excellent long-term
stability. The spent 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalysts after the ﬁrst and
eighth cycle are denoted as the R-1 Cycle and the R-8 Cycle, respec-
tively. Fig. 9 illustrates the TPR patterns of the fresh sample and the

R-8 Cycle (calcined) catalyst. The reduction peaks show only slight
variation, indicating that the active VOX species of the catalyst
undergoes no signiﬁcant change and maintain high dispersion over
the porous silica solid. The XPS data of R-8 Cycle (calcined) catalyst
indicates that there is almost no change in the V4+/V5+ ratio after 8
reaction-regeneration cycles in Fig. S-9 and Table S-2. Fig. 10
shows the TGA curves of the spent catalysts. The weight decrease
can be considered as the loss of physically adsorbed water below
200 C [27]. The R-1 Cycle and R-8 Cycle curves exhibit similar
weight loss in the 200–550 C range, which can be attributed to
carbon deposition on the catalysts. The loss at above 400 C may
be attributed to the combustion of different types of coke (poly-
meric carbon) [35]. The similar coke deposition in the 1st and
8th cycles (inserted table in Fig. 10) may partially reﬂect the supe-
rior regeneration stability of the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. Addi-
tionally, the catalytic performance of the catalyst are obtained at
580 C within 21 h and shown in Fig. S-10. The conversion of the
catalyst slowly decreases with time and maintains at 30% after
10 h reaction. The result suggests that V-SiO2 catalysts have good
stability in this work. These results indicate that the VOX-SiO2 cat-
alyst with 60 C gelation temperature and 580 C calcination tem-
perature exhibits superior long-term stability for PDH reaction.
4. Conclusions
Porous VOX-SiO2 solids were synthesized at different gelation
and calcination temperatures through an in–situ one-step method
and evaluated by non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH).
The structure-performance relationship of VOX-SiO2 catalysts indi-
cates that an increase in gelation temperature over a certain tem-
perature range (60 C) has a slight inﬂuence on catalytic
performance and will remarkably shorten the gelation process
time during one-step synthesis. As a result, the VOX-SiO2 catalyst
gelled at 60 C shortens the gelation process time by half compared
to the catalyst gelled at 30 C and obtains a similar catalytic yield
after 4 h reaction. When the catalyst is gelled above the boiling
point of ethanol (78.3 C), the structure and performance of porous
VOX-SiO2 solids will be remarkably changed, especially for the cat-
alyst gelled at 90 C. In addition, the catalyst calcined at 580 C
exhibits superior stability, and the higher calcination temperature
will obviously inﬂuence structural properties and catalytic perfor-
mance. Note that the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst investigated in this
study exhibits excellent long-term stability. Its propane conversion
shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% within a 4 h reaction, and
the propene selectivity remains constant at around 91% over the
eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. The work reported here
would be beneﬁcial for further industrial development and appli-
cation of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis.
