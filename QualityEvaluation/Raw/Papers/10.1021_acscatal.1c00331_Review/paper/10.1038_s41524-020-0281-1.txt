Copper foil is the most promising catalyst for the synthesis of large-area, high-quality monolayer graphene. Experimentally, it has
been found that the Cu substrate is semi-molten at graphene growth temperatures. In this study, based on a self-developed C–Cu
empirical potential and density functional theory (DFT) methods, we performed systematic molecular dynamics simulations to
explore the stability of graphene nanostructures, i.e., carbon nanoclusters and graphene nanoribbons, on semi-molten Cu
substrates. Many atomic details observed in the classical MD simulations agree well with those seen in DFT-MD simulations,
conﬁrming the high accuracy of the C–Cu potential. Depending on the size of the graphene island, two different sunken-modes are
observed: (i) graphene island sinks into the ﬁrst layer of the metal substrate and (ii) many metal atoms surround the graphene
island. Further study reveals that the sinking graphene leads to the unidirectional alignment and seamless stitching of the
graphene islands, which explains the growth of large single-crystal graphene on Cu foil. This study deepens our physical insights
into the CVD growth of graphene on semi-molten Cu substrate with multiple experimental mysteries well explained and provides
theoretic references for the controlled synthesis of large-area single-crystalline monolayer graphene.

INTRODUCTION
Following its ﬁrst preparation by exfoliation from graphite in 2004,
graphene has attracted much attention both for fundamental
studies and technological applications, owing to its unique
morphology and excellent mechanical, electronic and optical
properties.
It
is
expected
that
wafer-scale
single-crystalline
graphene ﬁlms will function as ideal platforms for the develop-
ment
of
future
high-performance
graphene-based
devices1.
Consequently, great efforts have been made to synthesize large
single-crystalline graphene (SCG) monolayers2–4 on transition
metal catalyst through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth
—the most promising, cheap and readily accessible synthetic
approach so far reported for graphene5. The graphene islands,
formed during the initial nucleation process6–11, are crucial in the
mechanism of graphene growth and determine the quality of the
grown graphene by functioning either as nucleation seeds6,12,13 or
as building blocks for the coalescence of graphene nano-islands9.
In previous studies, large SCG was realized by the seamless
stitching of highly oriented islands on single-crystal substrate,
such as Cu(111)14 and Ge (110)15. Most recently, ultra-fast growth
of meter-sized SCG has been achieved by producing super-large
Cu (111) foil16. As an epitaxial growth, the unidirectionally aligned
graphene islands on the Cu (111) surface are guided by the lattice
symmetry of the single-crystal substrate17.
Before graphene islands form, various intermediates such as
carbon dimers, atomic carbon nanoarches or networks of carbon
clusters, have been observed both in early experiments18,19 and
theoretic
calculations20–22.
For
instance,
based
on
density-
functional molecular dynamics simulations, the very intricate
pathways of reaction for metal organic chemical vapor deposition
(MOCVD) of AlN on graphene can be identiﬁed at the atomic level
with rich chemistry uncovered23. Unexpected defects such as
pentagons usually appear during the nucleation stage and
degrade the ﬁnal quality of CVD-grown graphene. To circumvent
the formation of these detrimental defects created during the
initial stages of growth, defect-free polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbons (PAHs consisting of six-membered carbon rings) have
been proposed as ideal precursors for the fabrication of graphene
with low defect concentration, on Au (111)24, Pt (111)25 and Cu
(111)26.
Among
these
different
carbonaceous
motifs,
the
coronene-like cluster, C24, is widely regarded as the ideal carbon
precursor for the growth of high-quality graphene by self-
assembly on a Cu (111) surface27,28 due to its six-fold rotation
symmetry and dome-shaped structure, a result of the interaction
of the peripheral atoms of the carbon cluster with the substrate
metal29–31. Although it is widely believed that these active carbon
species readily move on the metal surface, coalescing into larger
islands, and eventually forming the ﬁnal graphene domain27,32,
the motion and coalescence dynamics at the atomic level of these
carbon islands still remain elusive. For example, based on static
DFT calculations, a new growth mode called “embedded” growth,
has recently been proposed. In the embedded mode, it was found
to be energetically favorable for graphene islands to “sink” into
“soft” metals like Cu (111), during the growth of graphene33.
Different from that on nickel surface, the growth of graphene
on copper surface is a surface-mediated process due to the very
low solubility of carbon in bulk Cu2–4,34,35. Typical experimental
temperatures during growth are ~1273 K (1000 °C), which is very
close to the melting point of bulk Cu at ~1358 K (1085 °C)4,14,16,36.
Under this temperature, the surface of the Cu substrate is

observed to be highly mobile37, which presents the characteristics
of melting. Thus the Cu surface is thought to be nearly molten or
liquid and can never be considered as a strict crystalline lattice as
before38. How does the graphene island sink into such a “semi-
molten” Cu surface? Why are the graphene islands aligned on the
surface molten Cu surface? Will the graphene sinking create
detrimental effects on the stitching mechanism of the graphene
grains or affect the ﬁnal quality of larger merged graphene ﬁlm? In
this article, based on a self-developed C–Cu classical potential and
density functional theory, MD simulations were performed to
study the sinking of the graphene on a semi-molten Cu substrate.
Two different sunken-modes, which depend on graphene island
size, were revealed. Further, the embedded graphene tends to be
unidirectionally aligned and the seamless stitching of the adjacent
graphene grains is preferred.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Sinking of carbon nanocluster
Figure 1a–f show the cross-sections of a C24 cluster on the Cu
(111) substrate after 120 ps MD simulations at 1200, 1250, 1300,

1400,
and
1450 K,
respectively.
The

views
of
the corresponding conﬁgurations are shown in Supplementary
Fig. 2. In our MD simulations, only the top layer Cu atoms melt
while other layers of the substrate remains in a crystalline shape
even at 1450 K owning to the approach of semi-inﬁnite surface
adopted in our model. Thus the substrate is in a state between
liquid and solid. We name the substrate a “semi-molten” substrate.
As shown in Fig. 1h, during the MD simulation, the Lindemann
index39 of the substrate oscillates between those of liquid and
solid. As shown in Fig. 1a, b, the upmost surface of Cu substrate is
stable and retains its original crystallinity at lower temperatures (T

< 1350 K). The C24 cluster ﬂoats on the surface during the whole
simulation and no sinking is observed.
Previous studies have reported that during graphene growth,
graphene edges bound to a metal step are energetically
preferred6,8,40. It has also been observed that graphene ribbons
tended to stand upright on a ﬂat metal terrace41 while a graphene
island like C24 prefers to form dome-like structure with its edge
bent towards the terrace20. In our MD simulation, the C24 cluster
also presents a dome-like geometry (Fig. 1a), similar to that
reported in the previous studies20. The height of the dome-like C24
on Cu surface is ~0.6 Å, which is ~50% of that of C24 on a Ni (111)
surface42. At 1300 K, the top layer of Cu atoms start to melt slightly
with a small proportion of Cu atoms diffusing out of the surface to
attach to the edge of C24 (Fig. 1c). These diffused Cu atoms can be
viewed as a newly-formed atomic layer passivating the edge of
the C24 cluster. Therefore, different from the dome-like ﬂake on
the Cu surface shown in Fig. 1a, C24 can form metal-carbon σ
bonds with surrounding Cu atoms and its shape becomes ﬂat (Fig.
1c). When the temperature approaches 1350 K, the substrate
becomes highly disordered and the C24 starts to sink into the
substrate (Fig. 1d). The higher the temperature, the deeper the C24
cluster sinks (Fig. 1e, f). Besides, as it sinks deeper, the domelike
structure of C24 becomes increasingly ﬂatter (Fig. 1g). To quantify
the degree of sinking of the C24 cluster, the average heights
(z coordinates relative to z = 0) along the z direction (see the axes
in Fig. 2d) of the mass centers of C24 (h-C24) and the surrounding
Cu atoms (h-SCu) during the ﬁnal 20 ps are compared in Fig. 1i.
With the increase of the temperature, the h-C24 decreases
obviously whereas h-SCu remains almost unchanged with only a
slight ﬂuctuation at ~3.5 Å. The height difference Δh, where
Δh ¼ h  C24  h  SCu, therefore drops to below 0 Å at tem-
peratures higher than 1350 K, indicating the complete sinking of
the C24 cluster.
In order to investigate the detailed sinking process, the
smoothed instantaneous heights of C24 (h-C24) and surrounding
Cu atoms (h-SCu) as a function of MD time are also calculated. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, at temperatures <1300 K, the h-
C24 and h-SCu are almost parallel, implying that both the sinking
of C24 and the surface melting cannot take place (Supplementary
Figs. 1a, b). At 1300 K, both h-C24 and h-SCu start to rise after
90 ps, which can be mainly attributed to change in the mass
centers of C24 and the surrounding Cu atoms (Supplementary Fig.
1c). In other words, the original dome-like shape of C24, stable at
lower temperatures, begins to ﬂatten at 1300 K due to edge
passivation by several Cu atoms that diffused upwards. Therefore,
the mass center of the C24 cluster is raised by ~0.3–0.5 Å, which is
consistent with a previous density function theory (DFT) calcula-
tion on the height difference between C24 and coronene on a
metal substrate20. In addition, the mass center of the surrounding
Cu atoms is also raised by ~0.5–0.75 Å because of their upward
diffusion. Up to this point, we can see that the C24 ﬂoats on the Cu
(111) surface without sinking. However, as shown in Fig. 2a, when
the temperature is 1350 K, the h-C24 begins to drop sharply by
~ 1 Å after ~60 ps (red arrow). The height difference between C24
and Cu surface is greatly reduced from ~2.25 to ~0.5 Å at 66.5 ps.
After 110 ps, the height difference is further reduced to be less
than 0.20 Å, indicating that the C24 has already been fully
embedded in the semi-molten Cu surface. The potential energy
proﬁle in Fig. 2g shows that the sinking process after 60 ps is
energetically preferred because of the downward trend. The
snapshots of the sinking process at ﬁve different MD times are
shown in Fig. 2d. Clearly, at 54.35 ps, the C24 is still on the Cu
surface. At 66.5 ps, the C24 sinks into the Cu. After 70 ps, the C24
rises up at 87.2 ps and fall down at 89.6 ps, corresponding to the
height ﬂuctuation of the C24 in Fig. 2a. At 112.35 ps, the C24 is fully
embedded in the Cu substrate with their height difference as
small as 0.13 Å. With the increase of temperature, the onset time
for C24 sinking, denoted by red arrows, is advanced from 60 (T =
1350 K) ps to 40 ps (T = 1400 K) and then to 10 ps (T = 1450 K)
(Fig. 2b, c). Moreover, the height difference between C24 and
surrounding Cu atoms are further reduced even with higher Cu
atoms observed in Fig. 2b, c. In previous studies, Yuan et al.
proposed that the sinking of graphene in CVD growth can be
achieved either by removing metal atoms under a graphene
island, or by the adsorption of fast moving metal atoms around a
graphene island to form a new atomic layer33. Clearly, the former
pathway is the dominant sunk mechanism at high temperatures ≥
1350 K. To distinguish this sunken-mode with the later one, we
deﬁne it as “sunken-mode I”.
For comparison, Fig. 2f shows the C24 embedded in the liquid
substrate, 8-layers free Cu atoms, at 1350 K. Different with the
semi-molten substrate, the crystallinity of the Cu layers completely
disappears. As shown in Fig. 2e, the heights of the C24 cluster
drops from 10.5 to 8.75 Å very quickly in only 20 ps with the
height difference reduced to ~0.15 Å. After 67 ps, the h-SCu
begins to exceed h-C24 with the height gap near 0.5–1 Å.
Compared with the semi-molten substrate, it is, therefore, easier
for C24 to sink and be embedded in the liquid surface. In order to
verify the observations in the classical MD simulation shown
above, we performed an extensive DFT-MD simulation to explore
the behavior of a C24 cluster on a Cu (111) substrate at 1350 K.
Owning to the high computational cost of DFT-MD, we use 3-free-
layers Cu (111) substrate to accelerate the surface melting, which
can reduce the computation time effectively. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. 7, at 0.23 ps, the surface has not melted yet
and the dome-like C24 appears with the dome height ~0.9 Å
(Supplementary Fig. 7b), which is close to 0.6 Å in our classic MD
simulations. After 2 ps, an obvious sinking of the C24 cluster into
the substrate can be observed (Supplementary Fig. 7c-f) with the
height difference ~0.5 Å (Supplementary Fig. 7g). Thus, the results
of the classic and DFT MD are qualitatively consistent.
After knowing the sunken-mode of C24 at higher temperatures,
we may ask a question as to whether a larger graphene island also
shows the same sunken-mode or not. To answer this question,
larger carbon clusters of C54 and C96, including 19 and 37
hexagons were selected for further simulations. As shown in Fig.
3a, unlike C24, the C54 did not sink into the substrate but just ﬂoat
on the substrate surface at 1350 K. Only some melted Cu atoms
diffuse upwards and form metal step with C54 edge partially
passivated. For this reason, Fig. 3d shows that there is no obvious
drop of C54 height line and a height gap of ~1.5 Å between C54
and the underlying Cu surface always exists (Fig. 3d). Even at
higher temperatures like 1400 and 1450 K (Fig. 3b, c), C54 prefers
to ﬂoat on the Cu surface and the surface Cu atoms eventually
melt and diffuse upwards to surround it. Although the height gap
between C54 and surrounding Cu atoms is greatly reduced in Fig. 3
(e, f), this behavior can be attributed only to the lifting-up of the
surrounding Cu atoms rather than the sinking down of C54. In
other words, the C54 cluster cannot sink into the substrate as easily
as C24. Thus, we deﬁne such a sunken-mode as “sunken-mode II”,
which is different form “sunken-mode I” aforementioned. The
reason for this difference is that, due to the larger size of the C54
cluster, more underlying Cu atoms need to out-diffuse to form a
basin for the cluster to sink, which in turn, requires a greater
energy cost. Besides, the C54 cluster is energetically more stable
on the Cu (111) surface owing to its lower edge atoms/inner
atoms ratio. Thus, there is a smaller driving force for the sinking of
the C54 cluster when compared to C24. In this respect, the sunken-
mode II of C54 at high temperatures is achieved by the adsorption
of fast moving metal atoms underlying a graphene island to form
a new atomic layer. As for a much larger cluster like C96, it always
ﬂoats on the Cu (111) surface for a wide range of temperatures
from 1300 to1450 K (Supplementary Fig. 4). We can thus conclude
that the larger carbon nanoclusters prefer the “sunken-mode II”
with only the carbon edges embedded in the metal atoms
diffused from the underlying semi-molten substrate.

Orientation of carbon nanocluster
It is well known that the orientation of the graphene islands
formed at the early stage is very crucial to the ﬁnal formation of
larger graphene, such as the morphology, grain boundary, moiré
pattern and so on43,44. By controlling the orientation of graphene
island as well as associated growth conditions, various shapes of
graphene grains can be synthesized12,45–47. To eliminate the
anisotropic effect of the solid surface on the orientation of
graphene domain, the liquid Cu surface is proposed to provide
isotropic surface for the uniform formation of the graphene
grains35,48,49.
Recent theoretic study shows that coalescence of randomly
rotated graphene islands on the liquid Cu surface only has the 0°
(single crystal) and 30°-twinned polycrystal as highly stable grain
boundaries. In our simulation, the orientation of the C24 is proved
to depend strongly on surface states of the metal catalyst at
different temperatures. At the lower temperature far below the
melting point, the C24 cluster only vibrates rigidly, and sporadi-
cally, it rotates by ~20° and then returns to 0° very soon
(Supplementary Fig. 5). These rotations only result in many sharp
peaks but with no obvious orientation change. Based on our
previous DFT calculation43, the orientation of graphene island, like
C24 and C54, is mainly constrained in a speciﬁc alignment at lower
temperatures by the interaction between the edge atoms and Cu
surface with the rotation barrier as high as 0.96 and 5.18 eV,
respectively. For this reason, the rotation freedoms of larger
clusters of C54 and C96 are expected to be reduced compared with
C24 at the same temperatures due to the higher rotation barriers
(Supplementary Fig. 5). When the temperature rises to 1350 K or
higher, the C24 starts to rotate gradually on the semi-molten
surface as a function of MD time at temperature of 1350 K with its
orientation changed apparently (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig.
5). It is noticed that the distribution of the rotation angle for C24
also depends strongly on the surface state. On one hand, as

shown in Fig. 4a, c, the rotation angles on the semi-molten surface
at 1350 and 1400 K present narrow distributions only at 0° and 60°,
respectively. Due to unique sunk- mode of the C24 aforemen-
tioned, its orientation is constrained by the unmolten subsurface
with six-fold lattice symmetry. On the other hand, there is a
broader distribution of the rotation angles for the C24 on the liquid
Cu surface at the same temperatures due to the isotropic lattice of
liquid Cu (Fig. 4b, d).
Stitching of graphene
As mentioned before, the seamless stitching of the graphene
during the merge of the graphene domains is a signiﬁcant step for
formation of large-area single crystal graphene14–16,50. When the
graphene sinking occurs, will these separated graphene domains
coalescence into a larger one without defects? And, what are the
atomistic details? To answer these questions, we select periodic
graphene nanoribbons with a narrow gap as stereotypical model
for mimicking the stitching process. Firstly, three graphene
nanoribbons on Cu (111) surface, containing 3, 5, and 8 rows of
hexagonal rings along the width direction (GNR-3, GNR-5, and
GNR-8), are designed to study their structures on the Cu substrate.
Figure 5 shows their structures after MD simulation of 200 ps at
temperatures of 1200, 1350, and 1400 K, respectively. Clearly, at
the lower temperature 1200 K, the upmost surface has not started
to melt and the edges of all GNRs bend toward the Cu surface
with arched ribbons formed (Fig. 5a–c). When the temperature is
increased to 1350 K, the higher temperature leads to the
formation of a metal step (Fig. 5d–f) with one-atom layer at one
side of the GNR edges. The arched ribbons are therefore ﬂattened
due to the edge passivation. With further increase of the
temperature, more metal atoms in the substrate diffused out
and form the metal steps for GNR-3 and GNR-5(Fig. 5g–i). Thus, the
GNRs on the semi-molten Cu substrate can be viewed as
embedded ribbon based on sunken-mode II. Again, the DFT-MD
simulations are carried out to verify our classic MD results. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. 8, the GNRs bend toward to the
surface and form the arched ribbon at the early stage when the
surface has not melted. After ~6–7 ps, the arched GNRs are
ﬂattened with the metal step formed near the edges. Height of
the ribbon edges and the metal steps during the ﬁnal stage
indicate that the ribbon edges are embedded in the metal steps,
which are highly consistent with our classic MD results in Fig. 5.
So far, a clear conclusion is that with increase of the size, the
carbon nanoclusters and/or GNRs can be well ﬂattened on the Cu
surface by the edge passivation of the metal steps, particularly on
the substrate with surface melting. The following question,
however, is that will these metal steps affect the ﬁnal formation
of the high-quality graphene, particularly on the semi-molten

substrate. Or say, will these metal steps remain there and create
defects during the stitching of the GNRs or disappear eventually
with perfect graphene left? To solve this problem, we performed a
MD simulation by adding carbon atoms randomly into the gap
between two edges of GNR-8 on the Cu substrate. Very
surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 6a–j, the metal step (yellow atoms),
which is clamped by the two GNR edges, disappears with the
stitching of graphene (red carbons) and a near perfect graphene
sheet is eventually formed with only one 5|7 defect left. The
atomistic details show that the atoms of metal steps can not only
diffuse into the substrate below but also facilitate the defect
healing and the hexagon formation. As shown in white rectangles
of Fig. 6c, d, with the assistance of the yellow atoms, the two
carbon chains are connected and transformed to a hexagon
successfully. Also, a 5|7 defect in Fig. 6e is healed to be two
hexagons (Fig. 6f, g). Besides, a carbon vacancy can also be healed
by a carbon atom newly added on the upmost Cu atom. As shown
in Fig. 6h-j, with the sinking of upmost Cu atom (yellow) into the
substrate beneath graphene, the adatom C ﬁlls the carbon
vacancy perfectly. The stitching of graphene on Ni (111) substrate
can also occur between two adjacent graphene ribbons as shown
in Supplementary Fig. 9 although the atomic details are different
from Cu. Because of the higher melting point of the nickel
substrate as well as the large carbon solubility in Ni, our
simulations show that a simulated graphene ribbon cannot sink
as easily as on a Cu substrate and tends to maintain an arc-bridge
shape on the ﬂat Ni substrate. Further, compared with graphene
stitching on a Cu substrate at the same temperatures, more
defects in the stitching area are observed. Therefore, the sinking of
the graphene on a Cu substrate promises a better method for
graphene stitching.
Here, we may propose a new explanation to the mysteries that
why semi-molten substrate is suitable for the growth of large SCG
graphene from another point of view by fully addressing the
signiﬁcance of the unique sinking kinetics discovered in our
results. In details, the orientations of the small carbon clusters at
the early stage of graphene growth can be well aligned on the
semi-molten substrate via the sunken-mode I and the grain
boundaries can be therefore greatly reduced. When the graphene
islands grow larger, they can be well ﬂattened by metal steps
attached to their edges due to the sunken-mode II. Such ﬂat
graphene islands can not only facilitate the seamless merge of the
graphene islands but also prevent the small interstitial atoms (e.g.,
carbon precursors) from diffusing into the subsurface beneath the
graphene sheets and reduce the formation probability of the
defects and new nuclei for the growth of second-layer graphene.
In conclusion, the sinking kinetics of graphene islands on semi-
molten Cu (111) substrate, including carbon nanoclusters and
graphene nanoribbons, were systematically investigated at the
atomic scale via classical MD simulations. It was conﬁrmed that C24

can sink into the semi-molten Cu substrate at temperatures T ≥
1350 K. However, such a sunken-mode (Sunken-mode I) trans-
formed to the second mode (Sunken-mode II) with the increase of
cluster sizes. Thus, large clusters like C54 and C96 preferred ﬂoating
on the upmost surface with its edges passivated by molten Cu
atoms. Compared with the liquid substrate, the orientation of the
C24 on semi-molten substrate showed a narrow distribution with
the rotation angle concentrating around 0° and 60° owning to the
speciﬁc sunken-mode and the lattice symmetry of unmolten Cu
layers. For graphene nanoribbons, the sunken-mode II was
preferred. They also present arched or ﬂattened shapes depend-
ing on the metal steps formed. These metal steps, surprisingly, can
assist in defects healing during the seamless stitching of graphene
nanoribbons instead of creating defects. This study serves to
deepen our physical insights into the CVD growth of graphene on
semi-molten Cu substrates and explains multiple experimental
mysteries. These calculations can also provide theoretic references
for the controlled synthesis of large single-crystal graphene.

Finally, the modeling approach, including the C-M potential and
classic MD developed in this article were conﬁrmed against DFT-
MD and can thus be applied to many simulations of graphene
growth on similar metals.
METHODS
Four-layer Cu (111) slabs with periodicities of 35.75 × 39.84 × 100 Å and
23.00 × 22.14 × 100 Å were adopted as the metal substrates for the
exploration of carbon nanoclusters (i.e., C24, C54, C96) and graphene
nanoribbons, respectively. To mimic the semi-inﬁnite surface, Cu atoms in
the bottom layer were ﬁxed during the simulation.
Pure classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed
with a time step of 0.5 fs. Similar to our previous work51, the velocity
Verlet algorithm and the Berendsen thermostat52 (see the Supplementary
Methods) were adopted in MD simulations. The empirical potential energy
surface (PES) employed in this study has already been successfully applied
to simulate the growth of carbon nanotubes and graphene on Ni
surface42,51. More speciﬁcally, this new PES is based on the modiﬁed
second generation of the reactive empirical bond order (REBO2) potential
of carbon-carbon interaction53, the carbon-metal interaction54–56 and the
many-body tight-binding (TB) potential for metal–metal interaction57. With
26 parameters, we can further tune the carbon-metal interactions
precisely. In particular, the angle-dependent graphene edge-substrate
interaction was included in order to simulate the dome-like shape of
graphene clusters on a Cu surface42.
The benchmarked structures used for the parameters ﬁtting is similar to
those used in our previous work42. The energies listed in Supplementary
Tables 1 and 2 are the calculated formation energies of the benchmark
structures. After parameter ﬁtting, three graphene clusters (C20, C21, and
C24) on Cu (111) surface were adopted to test the PES with the results
shown in Supplementary Table 3. The low carbon solubility in the Cu
substrate has been considered in our potential (Supplementary Fig. 10).
Moreover, to further verify the results of classical MD simulations, DFT-MD
simulations were also carried out for comparison with the calculation
details presented in the Supplementary Methods.
