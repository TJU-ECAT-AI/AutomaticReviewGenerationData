deactivation with time on stream, which 
requires the periodic regeneration of the 
catalyst by coke combustion at oxidative 
atmosphere and high temperature. This 
regeneration process can accelerate the 
sintering of Pt nanoparticles, which need 
to be redispersed using a corrosive process 
called oxychlorination.[6] From above all, 
characterizing the structure of coke and 
their formation pathway was significant 
for tackling this problem.
According to the previous studies, coke 
could be produced on the metal site and 
surface of catalyst support, respectively.[7] 
Furthermore, only a small part of coke was 
located on the metal, which was usually 
believed to be responsible for deactivation. 
However, qualification on this kind of coke was rather difficult 
because large amounts of coke were present on the surface of 
catalyst support, disturbing the analysis. Herein, we reported a 
distinct nature of coke on the alloyed Pt sites. Several C3 spe-
cies were identified as carbonaceous deposits on surface of 
PtSn alloy. In addition, several pathways for their production 
were investigated by DFT calculation as well. Further, these 
coke could be hydrogenated to propylene in PDH process. This 
finding can provide a theoretical guidance for enhancing pro-
pylene yield and catalyst stability in PDH process.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Catalyst Characterization
Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 were both prepared by wetness 
impregnation. BET surface areas of Al2O3 support, Pt/Al2O3, 
and PtSn/Al2O3 were 103.74, 92.38, and 84.96 m2 g-1 (Table S1, 
Supporting Information), respectively. The slight decrease of 
BET surface area after impregnation may be due to blockage of 
pores by metal particles. From X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, 
Pt and PtSn catalysts after calcination both showed intensive 
peaks belonged to metallic Pt (Figure S1, Supporting Informa-
tion). After reduction under H2 atmosphere, PtSn intermetallic 
compound appeared on PtSn/Al2O3 (Figure  1a). Then high-
resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was 
employed to characterize Pt-based nanoparticles. For PtSn cata-
lyst, the sizes of metal nanoparticles were mostly below 3 nm 
(Figure 1b). A few particles of hundreds nanometer were found 
and elementary analysis showed that Pt/Sn (atomic ratio) was 
almost 1 (Figure S2, Supporting Information), consistent with 
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalyzed by PtSn/Al2O3 is a vital industrial 
process for producing propylene, a significant building block in the chemical 
industry. However, coke produced in the process deactivates the catalyst and 
the energy-intensive regeneration procedures can produce considerable CO2 
emission. In this work, coke on the spent catalysts is analyzed by thermo-
gravimetric-mass spectra, Raman spectra, 1H solid NMR spectra, and infrared 
spectra. Several C3 species, including propyl, propylidene and propylidyne are 
found on the surface of the PtSn alloy. Several reaction pathways are investi-
gated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is also found that this 
coke can be hydrogenated to propylene in the PDH process. These results  
could provide theoretical guidance for optimizing process parameters in 
industry.

1. Introduction
Propylene is an important building block in the chemical 
industry, mostly obtained by steam cracking of naphtha 
and fluid catalytic cracking as a byproduct.[1] However, large 
amounts of shale gas were discovered worldwide in recent 
years, making the source of steam cracking lighter. This may 
lead to a shortage of propylene in the near future.[2] Therefore, 
on-purpose techniques for producing propylene had been much 
more attractive.[3] Among these technologies, propane dehydro-
genation (PDH) had gained much attention due to its superior 
selectivity to propylene and low cost of propane.[4] Pt was found 
to be more efficient for activating CH bond compared with 
CC bond and so considered to be an ideal choice for PDH.[5] 
Pt-based catalysts was used in the Pacol process (UOP), the first 
commercial alkane dehydrogenation technology and had been 
developed for PDH later.[5b] However, coke produced during 
PDH reaction could block the active site and lead to catalyst

the PtSn intermetallic phase defined by XRD patterns. And a 
few crystalline orientations of PtSn intermetallics were also 
observed in particles with about 3 nm (Figure 1c). For further 
clarifying the metallic structure, HAADF-STEM was performed 
(Figure 1d) and clear speckling of particles with sub-nano level 
confirmed the homogeneously alloying bimetallic clusters,[8] 
which was also testified by EDS mapping (Figure S3, Sup-
porting Information). For Pt/Al2O3 (Figure S4, Supporting 
Information), small clusters and big particles coexisted on 
the support, similar with PtSn/Al2O3. After PDH reaction, Pt 
and PtSn catalysts did not show much change in particle size 
(Figure S5, Supporting Information).
The surface composition of PtSn/Al2O3 was determined by 
XPS and the survey spectrum was shown in Figure S6a (Sup-
porting Information). Because of the overlap of Pt 4f and Al 
2p, only Sn 3d spectrum was analyzed here. In Figure S6b 
(Supporting Information), Sn 3d XPS spectra was deconvo-
luted according to previous studies.[9] The peaks centered 
at 485.8 and 494.3  eV was attributed to metallic Sn in PtSn 
alloy. The other two peaks at 486.8 and 495.3 eV correspond 
to Sn oxide. Further, infrared spectroscopy with CO as a probe 
molecule was conducted to figure out the surface structure and 
the results were shown in Figure 2. For Pt/Al2O3, the peak at 
2085 cm−1 can be ascribed to linearly adsorbed CO on Pt (111) 
surface of large aggregates,[10] and other two peaks at 2064 and 
2042 cm−1 were attributed to linearly adsorbed CO on high-
index facets and low-coordinated sites of Pt clusters, respec-
tively.[11] In addition, a broad peak at about 1820 cm−1 indicated 
the presence of adsorbed CO over bridged Pt sites.[12] In 
the spectrum of PtSn/Al2O3, one major absorption peak at 
2046 cm−1 should be due to linearly adsorbed CO at PtSn 
nanoparticles, observed in TEM images (Figure  1) and the 
shoulder band at 2067 cm−1 was caused by large PtSn inter-
metallics. And peak at around 1975 cm−1 was attributed to 
linearly adsorbed CO at sub-nano PtSn alloys. Compared to 
Figure 1.  a) XRD patterns of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts; b) STEM, c) HRTEM and d) HAADF-STEM images of PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst.

Pt/Al2O3, red-shift of these absorption peaks indicated that 
Pt withdraw considerable electrons from Sn. For another, 
absorption band of bridge bonded CO on Pt surface was 
almost invisible, which was consistent with the formation of 
PtSn intermetallics and alloys. However, a new band at about 
1930 cm−1 appeared. Bazin et  al. also found an absorption 
band at 1937 cm−1 and they thought it was caused by a bridged 
CO adsorption between Pt and Ce sites at the interface.[13] 
Considering that it exists a certain amount of SnOx species at 
the support (Figure S6, Supporting Information), which was 
consistent with other studies,[14] the band at 1930 cm−1 could 
be attributed to bridge adsorbed CO at the interfacial sites 
between Pt and SnOx species.
2.2. PDH Performance
Propane dehydrogenation was used to evaluate the performance 
of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 (Figure 3). For Pt/Al2O3, propane 
conversion decreased sharply in the first hour and then became 
mild. Propylene selectivity increased from 42% to 60% within 
3 h on stream. Much cracking products, including methane, 
ethane, and ethylene, were found in the flow and their selec-
tivity decreased from 36% to 17% in 3 h. The coke selectivity 
was about 20%. However, when Sn was added into catalyst, it 
was found that the catalyst was more stable during the dehydro-
genation and propylene selectivity was stabilized around 90%. 
Only trace cracking products was detected and the coke selec-
tivity was just about 10%. Overall, Sn was effective to enhance 
the performance of Pt catalysts in PDH reaction, especially by 
decreasing cracking products.
2.3. Coke Determination
The thermogravimetric-mass spectra (TG-MS) of the spent cat-
alysts (Figure S7, Supporting Information) were conducted to 
study coke species and they both showed two peaks. The former 
one at about 200 °C can be attributed to the coke species on the 
metal sites and the latter one at about 400 °C was due to coke at 
alumina support.[15] The Raman spectra of spent catalysts were 
shown in Figure 4a. Two broad peaks were deconvoluted to four 
bands, labeled as D4, D1, D3, and G.[16] G band was due to per-
fect graphitic carbon and D1 band can be ascribed to in-plane 
defects and heteroatoms. The ratios of ID1/IG, often used to rep-
resent graphitization degree of coke,[17] were both 2.88. Inten-
sity of D3 band, which was assigned to amorphous carbon, 
was much higher for spent PtSn catalyst than that of spent Pt 
catalyst, indicating that PtSn/Al2O3 produced more amorphous 
coke. Furthermore, in situ infrared spectrum was performed 
to detect surface species appeared in PDH (Figure  4b). After 
reaction at 360 °C, absorption band at about 1475 cm−1 could be 
attributed to the skeleton vibration of aromatics, which was pro-
duced on both two catalysts. In addition, three specific peaks at 
1458, 1392, and 1377 cm−1 appeared for PtSn/Al2O3, which could 
be attributed to vibration of methyl in propyl, propylidene, and 
propylidyne (Figure  4c).[18] It was also found that the valence 
state of Sn was influenced by these coke species. As shown in 
Figure S6 (Supporting Information), binding energy of Sn 3d 
electrons became slightly larger after PDH reaction.
Then coke hydrogenation was used to explore these spe-
cies further. Typically, 20  mL min−1 pure H2 was introduced 
to dispose the catalysts after 2 h PDH reaction followed by 
He purging. This hydrogenation was maintained for 1 h. The

composition of the outlet gas was analyzed by on-line GC. 
Then the reactor was purged by He again, followed by another 
PDH process. For Pt/Al2O3, reaction between H2 and the spent 
catalyst produced methane with selectivity higher than 98% 
(Figure  5a). Nevertheless, the situation was distinct for the 
PtSn/Al2O3 and C3 hydrocarbon, including propane and pro-
pylene were the two main products (Figure  5b). After the H2 
treatment, the conversion of propane was improved for both Pt 
and PtSn catalysts. In this case, methane and C3 hydrocarbon 
must be derived from the hydrogenation of coke at the metal 
sites. Methane could be produced by hydrogenation of atomic 
carbon or hydrogenolysis of aromatics, which needs to be 
investigated further. But hydrogenation of species containing 
three carbon atoms seems to be the only way to produce pro-
pylene and propane, suggesting that considerable species with 
three carbon atoms, such as 2-propyl, 2-propylidene, 1-propyl,

1-propylidene and 1-propylidyne (Figure  4c), were present on 
the spent PtSn catalyst.
1H solid NMR spectrum was also performed and the spectra 
of spent Pt and PtSn catalysts (Figure  6) both showed an 
obvious peak at about 4.9 ppm, which can be ascribed to sur-
face hydroxyl of Al2O3. It appeared a new peak at about -1 ppm 
for the spent PtSn catalyst, which may be caused by C3 spe-
cies shown in Figure  4c. And this peak vanished when this 
sample were treated at 300 °C under air. From TG-MS curves 
(Figure S7, Supporting Information), calcination at 300  °C 
would remove coke on the metal sites. And Figure S8 (Sup-
porting Information) showed that the performance of PtSn 
catalyst can be restored by burning the carbonaceous deposits 
at 300 °C, proving that coke on metal sites were indeed wiped 
out. So it can be summarized that coke on surface of PtSn alloy 
were mostly C3 species and this phenomenon manifested negli-
gible cracking probability on PtSn alloy.
2.4. DFT Calculations
Furthermore, DFT calculation was employed to investigate sev-
eral pathways in PDH. According to XRD patterns and HRTEM 
images, Pt (111) surface and Pt-terminated PtSn (102) surface 
was chosen to represent Pt and PtSn catalysts (Figure S9, Sup-
porting Information), respectively. CH bond dissociation was 
usually considered to be the first step in PDH reaction.[19] For 
propane, there are two kinds of CH bond, the primary and 
secondary CH bond. The latter one is more prone to be rup-
tured according to their dissociation energy and so CH3CHCH3 
(2-propyl) adsorbed was employed as a typical intermediate to 
discuss the reaction pathways. The optimized structure and 
dissociation energy was shown in Figures S10 and S11 (Sup-
porting Information). In terms of overall situation (Figure 7), 
all reactions were more difficult for PtSn alloy than Pt 
according to the dissociation energy. For β-H elimination, the 
reaction energy increased from -0.27 eV for Pt (111) to 0.21 eV 
for PtSn (102). And for cracking from CH3CHCH3 to CH3CH 
and CH3, this enhancement reached to 0.58  eV, higher than 
that of β-H elimination (0.48 eV). For another point, according 
to Figure 7b, deep dehydrogenation (step 3 in Figure 7a) should 
be more ready to happen on Pt (111) compared with cracking of 
CH3CHCH3. And CH3CCH3 derived from deep dehydrogena-
tion had a greater tendency to split by CC bond breakage with 
a dissociation energy of -0.57 eV. It was enhanced by 1.95 eV 
when PtSn alloy was formed, indicating that cracking was 
suppressed more severely than β-H elimination. It was con-
sistent with the catalytic performances.
2.5. Parameter Optimization
According to the above discussions, it can be concluded that 
propane tended to spilt into C1 species at Pt surface, due to 
high activity of Pt for the CC cleavage. As for PtSn catalyst, 
cracking of CC was relatively difficult and the selectivity 
for the corresponding alkenes would be extremely high. This 
comprehension can give a guidance for obtaining better per-
formance in PDH. It is well-known that more H2 can be intro-
duced to decrease the coke and enhance the stability. However, 
it can also bring about more cracking products for Pt/Al2O3 
(Figure  8a), leading to the decrease of propylene selectivity. 
When Pt atoms were well-mixed with Sn, the cracking selec-
tivity was extremely low and almost unchanged when H2/
propane ratio changed from 1 to 3. The propylene selectivity 
was even improved to around 93% at the expense of coke 
selectivity with the increase of H2/propane ratio (Figure  8b). 
This pheno­
menon can illuminate us that the propylene pro-
ductivity, selectivity and stability can be enhanced at the same 
time by adding more H2 (Figure 8d) when alloying PtSn cata-
lyst was used.
3. Conclusion
In summary, PtSn intermetallic compounds and sub-nano 
PtSn alloy were formed on the Al2O3 support. Based on the 
infrared spectra of adsorbed CO, Sn not only separated multi-
fold Pt sites but also donated electrons to Pt. In PDH reactions, 
PtSn/Al2O3 showed about 90% selectivity to propylene and only 
trace cracking products were produced. And for Pt/Al2O3, pro-
pylene selectivity was lower than 60% during the reaction and 
considerable amounts of propane were converted to cracking 
products. Several C3 species on PtSn surface were qualified 
by coke hydrogenation, infrared spectrum and 1H solid NMR 
spectra, indicating that it was rather difficult for PtSn alloy to 
break CC bond. DFT calculation also proved that multifold Pt 
sites on Pt (111) can break CC bond more smoothly than PtSn 
(102). This can give a mechanical insight into reaction pathways 
and provide a guidance for designing more efficient catalyst 
and suitable process parameters in the industry.

4. Experimental Section
Materials: H2PtCl6·6H2O (Pt ≥ 37.5 wt%) was purchased from Aladdin 
Chemistry Co., Ltd., SnCl4·5H2O (AR) and hydrochloric acid (36–38 wt%) 
were received from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Boehmite 
were obtained from Sasol. All reagents were used without further 
treatment.
Catalyst Preparation: The Al2O3 support was obtained by calcining 
boehmite at 1000 °C for 12 h under air. The Pt-based catalysts were 
prepared by the wetness impregnation method. Typically, 0.6  g Al2O3 
were impregnated by a certain amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous 
solution (10  mg mL-1 based on precursor) and SnCl4·5H2O solution 
(10  mg mL-1 based on precursor) with 0.6 m HCl in it. The nominal 
loadings of Pt and Sn were 1 wt% and 1.8 wt%, respectively. Then water 
was evaporated at 80 °C and the powders were dried at 120 °C for 3 h, 
followed by calcination at 600  °C for another 4 h. Finally, the powder 
would be reduced by H2 at 600 °C for 2 h and the obtained catalyst was 
name as PtSn/Al2O3. Pt/Al2O3 was prepared using the same method 
without adding SnCl4·5H2O solution.
Characterization: The N2 adsorption–desorption isothermal analysis 
was performed by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 and the 
BET equation was used to calculate the surface areas. X-ray diffraction 
was conducted on a Rigaku Ultima IV wide-angle X-ray diffractometer 
equipped with Cu Kα radiation. High resolution transmission electronic 
microscopy (HRTEM) was performed on JEOL JEM-2100F. Spherical 
aberration corrected transmission electron microscope was collected 
using a FEI Tian G2 80-200 ChemiSTEM. Infrared spectra were 
conducted on a Vertex 70 spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen 
cooled mercury–cadmium–telluride (MCT) detector and an in situ 
cell. All spectra of adsorbed CO were collected at 30 °C. Typically, the 
as-synthesized samples were prereduced in pure H2 at 20 mL min-1 for 
1 h at 300 °C and then cooled to 30 °C under pure Ar at 20 mL min-1, 
followed by recording a background spectrum. Thereafter, the samples 
were treated with 50 vol% CO (balanced with Ar) at 20  mL min-1 for 
1 h and then purged with Ar at 20  mL min-1 until the spectra of CO 
adsorption on samples approached to be stable. To record infrared 
spectra during PDH reaction in situ, the as-synthesized samples were 
prereduced in pure H2 at 20 mL min-1 for 1 h at 360 °C and then purged 
with Ar at 20 mL min-1, followed by collecting a background spectrum. 
Subsequently, 5 vol% C3H8 (balanced with He) with 20 mL min-1 was 
introduced. After 30  min reaction, the cell was purged with Ar with 
collecting spectra in the meantime. Thermogravimetric-mass spectra 
(TG-MS) were performed using METTLER TOLEDO TGA/DSC 1100SF 
and ThermoStar gas mass spectrometry from room temperature to 
1000 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min-1. Raman spectra were collected on 
JY HR 800 using 514 nm laser excitation at room temperature. Solid-state 
NMR measurements were performed using a Bruker Avance 400 III HD 
spectrometer (magnetic field strength 9.4 T) at resonance frequencies of 
400.1 Hz for 1H. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted 
using a Thermo Escalab 250Xi spectrometer. The binding energies were 
calibrated with respect to C 1s core level (284.6 eV).
Catalytic Tests: The catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation 
was evaluated in a tubular fixed-bed quartz reactor with 6  mm inner 
diameter under atmospheric pressure. Typically, 100  mg calcinated 
catalysts were placed in the middle of the reactor and supported by 
silica wool inside the reactor. The flow rate of each gas was regulated 
using calibrated mass-flow controllers (HORIBA). The temperature was 
controlled by using a type-K thermocouple positioned at the middle 
of the catalytic bed and a PID controller. Prior to reaction, the loaded 
catalysts were reduced by H2 at 600 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 
10 °C min-1. After purging the reactor with He for 30 min at 600 °C, a 
gas mixture (C3H8:H2:He = 1:1:19) was introduced into the reactor. 
The reaction temperature was 600 °C and weight hourly space velocity 
(WHSV) of propane was 2.7.
The reactants and products were analyzed using an on-line gas 
chromatograph (FULI 9750) equipped with a flame ionization detector 
(FID). The propane conversion and product selectivity (Si) were 
calculated as follows:

DFT Calculation: The calculations reported here were performed by 
using periodic density functional theory as implemented in the form of 
the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). For valence electrons, a 
plane-wave basis set was adopted with an energy cutoff of 400 eV and the 
ionic cores were described with the projector augmented-wave (PAW) 
method. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation 
functional was used as the exchange-correlation approximation. A 
2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid was used to sample the Brillouin 
zone. A four-layer slab with a p (4 × 4) supercell whose bottom two layers 
are fixed was used to model the Pt (111) surface. A p (2 × 4) supercell 
containing a 9-atom-layer slab with bottom three layers fixed was used 
to model PtSn (102) surface. The thickness of the vacuum region of 
all models is 15 Å. The total energy was converged to an accuracy of 
1 × 10−5 eV per atom to obtain accurate forces, and a force tolerance of 
0.02 eV Å−1 was used in all structure optimizations. The adsorption energy 
for molecule chemisorption are defined respectively as: Eads  = Etot – 
Eslab – Emol, where Etot is the total energy after a molecule adsorption 
on the catalyst; Eslab is the energy of the clean catalyst alone; Emol is the 
energy of the molecule in the gas phase.
