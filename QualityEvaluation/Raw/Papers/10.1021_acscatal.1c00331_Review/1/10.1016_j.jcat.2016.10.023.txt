Deposition of graphene-like coke during non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation was investigated on a
0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst. The initial blocking of Pt sites by graphene plays an important role in establish-
ing the excellent steady-state selectivity of Pt-based catalysts toward propylene. Temporal Analysis of
Products (TAP) pulse-response experiments was used to demonstrate that during the initial nucleation
of graphene-like coke, the blocked active sites are spontaneously recovered on the timescale of minutes
after the dosing of the feed is discontinued. These observations suggest that an additional transport pro-
cess is involved between the generation of coke precursors on Pt dehydrogenation sites and their subse-
quent assimilation into the growing graphene sheet. After continued exposure to the propane feed under
atmospheric pressure ﬂow conditions, extensive deposits of deformed graphene are formed on small Pt
nanoparticles and shifted onto the support. Multiple layers of graphite are also formed on large nanopar-
ticles. During subsequent oxidative catalyst regeneration (burning), some of these carbonaceous deposits
are readily oxidized in air already at 650 K, leading to signiﬁcant recovery of Pt sites. However, those car-
bonaceous deposits that are less accessible to activated oxygen resist oxidation up to 800 K. Ex situ TEM
characterization of incompletely burned samples and isothermal pulsed oxidation provided evidence that
transport phenomena on the surface determine the accessibility of graphene-like coke for oxidation at a
given temperature.

1. Introduction
Coke formation is ubiquitous in catalytic reactions of hydrocar-
bons and plays a decisive role in determining catalytic activity, sta-
bility, and selectivity [1,2]. Coke deposition within catalytic pellets
not only hinders catalytic activity by permanently blocking active
sites, but also causes adverse downstream effects including
decreased energy- and atom-efﬁciency, catalyst degradation dur-
ing regeneration cycles, and increased emissions of pollutants [3–
5]. However, coking effects are not exclusively detrimental. Some
degree of coking can improve catalytic selectivity by hindering
non-selective reactions to a greater extent than selective reactions.
Coke can be catalytically active itself [6,7] and it has been shown to
positively inﬂuence reactions on host catalytic surfaces [8,9].
While it is unlikely that coking can be completely avoided in any
(if not all) non-oxidative hydrocarbon reactions, rationally man-
aged coking can provide additional tools for process optimization
[10]. The diversity and signiﬁcance of coking effects in heteroge-
neous catalysis strongly motivate extensive investigation of coke
deposition as well as the regeneration processes by which it can
be removed. In addition, the same elementary processes involved
in coke formation on metal catalysts are also important for manu-
facturing functional nanomaterials based on carbon allotropes
such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [11] and graphene [12].
The formation of coke on supported transition metal nanoparti-
cles, which are widely used for industrial hydrocarbon processing,
generally
proceeds
through
the
following
consecutive
steps
[11–16]: (i) generation of deeply dehydrogenated surface species
from the hydrocarbon feed by step-wise dehydrogenation and
CAC bond scission, (ii) transport of these species to coke-forming
sites, (iii) their assimilation into growing coke deposits, and possi-
bly (iv) shifting of the growing coke deposits away from the metal

onto the catalyst support. These metal-mediated processes can
also be accompanied by parallel processes of coke formation on
the support materials, for example, via oligomerization and
cyclization of unsaturated species on acidic sites. On transition
metals with signiﬁcant carbon solubility, such as Pd, Co, Ni, and
Fe,
coke
grows
via
a
dissolution/precipitation
mechanism
[11,17,18] in which step (ii) is mediated by the bulk of the metal:
elemental carbon formed from the hydrocarbon feed ﬁrst dissolves
into the nanoparticles and then segregates into carbonaceous lay-
ers or ﬁlaments. The mechanism is different on transition metals
with limited carbon solubility, such as Pt which destabilizes sub-
surface absorption of carbon relative to surface adsorption [19]:
elemental carbon remains on the surface during the transport step
(ii) and the assimilation step (iii). In their seminal contributions,
Land et al. (see [20] and references therein) have directly observed
this surface-mediated process by STM on Pt single-crystal surfaces.
During the annealing of ethylene-covered Pt surface, dissociatively
adsorbed ethylene was ﬁrst dehydrogenated into ethylidyne which
then decomposed into C1 fragments. These coke precursors in the
form of monomers and dimers migrated toward coke nucleation
sites, where they were incorporated into the growing graphene
islands.
The coking/regeneration behavior of industrially-relevant sup-
ported catalysts may substantially differ from the behavior of
structurally simple single crystals, although the overall sequence
of steps is expected to be similar. In addition to the intrinsic prop-
erties of the metal, the coking behavior of supported nanoparticles
is also affected by a number of factors related to the catalyst’s
structural and electronic features. The ﬁnite size of metal nanopar-
ticles alters their electronic makeup, which may drastically change
the rates of the reaction steps involved in coking and coke burn-off.
Nanoparticles expose a large fraction of undercoordinated atoms
which provide structurally-diverse active sites for hydrocarbon
reactions [21–23] and coke nucleation, as established in extensive
studies of coking on Pt black by e.g. Paal and Schlögl [24,25]. In situ
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, environmental TEM, and other
advanced characterization techniques have demonstrated [26] in
recent years that metal nanoparticles can dynamically restructure
in reactive environments and form completely new types of
exposed metal sites. Moreover, the support itself can play an
important role in stabilizing the metal nanoparticles, by giving
raise to the adlineation sites along the metal-support interface,
and possibly by mediating the transport of coke precursors or acti-
vated oxidant species. Despite many years of research efforts
devoted to the study of coking in catalysis and the more recent
wave of studies inspired by the discovery of graphene, many
aspects of coke generation by this surface-mediated mechanism
and of coke removal from supported metal catalysts remain poorly
characterized.
The inﬂuence of ﬁnite particle size on coking behavior was
investigated by Peng et al. [27] who employed high-resolution ex
situ and in situ TEM to study coke formation on MgO-supported
size-controlled Pt nanoparticles upon exposure to either isobutene
or ethane. Coke deposits on these catalysts consist exclusively of
graphene sheets that form on the stepped Pt surfaces. For Pt parti-
cles <6 nm, the graphene sheets shift onto the support surface and
Pt particles >6 nm are encapsulated by the sheets. The resulting
morphology of deposited graphene is controlled by the ability of
nanoparticles to accommodate the strain energy generated by
the growing carbon deposits and by the strength of carbon-metal
bonding. Importantly, the authors decisively conclude that gra-
phene is formed on supported Pt nanoparticles via the surface-
mediated mechanism rather than the absorption/segregation
mechanism based on the observed invariance of Pt lattice parame-
ters in their experiments. The same group has recently shown by
environmental TEM [28] that Pt nanoparticles undergo extensive
restructuring during carbon deposition, which leads to circularity
(rounding) of the nanoparticles due to the formation of new
stepped surfaces. The same process explains the parallel formation
of multiple encapsulating layers of carbon on >6 nm particles via
continuous nucleation and shift of graphene sheets together with
Pt atoms to which they remain attached. The entire surface of
the nanoparticles appears to be in a state of constant atomic ﬂux
at the reaction conditions. The atomic details of this surface-
mediated mechanism remain largely unknown, especially at the
early stages of graphene nucleation on small nm-sized particles.
Herein, formation of graphene-like coke is investigated on a
0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox dehydrogenation catalyst closely related to the
MgO-supported catalyst studied by Peng and co-authors [27].
The investigated catalyst was selected as a model material for a
number of reasons. It belongs to a family of catalysts derived from
Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs) which have recently attracted
considerable academic and industrial interest. Collapsed LDHs
are thermally-stable materials with a high surface area that can
be used as precursors for mono- and polymetallic catalysts with
excellent dispersion characteristics and improved control over
the degree of metal alloying. Previous studies of Pt [29,30], PtASn
[31], PtAGa [32,33], PtAIn [34–36], and PtAIr [37] LDH-derived
catalysts have demonstrated that coking, which always occurs dur-
ing the initial period of alkane dehydrogenation, plays a critical
role in determining the steady-state activity and selectivity of
these catalysts. The amount of coke formed always exceeds the
stoichiometric amount of available Pt sites, suggesting that at least
part of the coke is shifted onto the LDH-derived support (see
Fig. 2). Dopants such as Ga and In are believed to facilitate the des-
orption of oleﬁns from the surface, thus hindering secondary side
reactions leading to coke. Dopants also assist in shifting the grow-
ing carbon deposits from the metallic nanoparticles. These obser-
vations invite further investigation of coking behavior on LDH-
derived Pt as well as Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.
In addition to their industrial relevance, these catalysts provide
a convenient model for characterizing chemically-homogeneous
carbon deposits. Like pristine MgO, collapsed LDHs (Mg(Al)Ox)
are slightly alkaline support materials that do not form signiﬁcant
amounts of coke in the absence of catalytically-active metal
nanoparticles. We hypothesized that the 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst
should produce exclusively graphene-like carbonaceous deposits,
as observed by Peng et al. [27], which can be characterized in iso-
lation from other types of coke. Chemical homogeneity of coke
deposits on the investigated material was necessary in this study,
and facilitated a novel interpretation of the complex carbon oxida-
tion kinetics.
Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) is widely employed
for coke characterization on supported metal catalysts. During a
TPO measurement, several peaks of CO2 typically evolve from the
catalyst upon gradual heating in oxygen ﬂow. When two clearly
distinguished CO2 peaks are observed on supported Pt catalysts,
their assignment in the literature commonly follows an established
pattern: the lower temperature peak is assigned to the coke
located on the metal sites and the higher temperature peak is
assigned to the coke located on the support [38,39]. This simplistic
picture necessitates substantial reﬁnement to enable rational
strategies of coke management and to advance TPO as a character-
ization method. As a rule, the ﬁrst CO2 peak is comparable (by area)
to the second peak. The assignment of these two peaks to metal
and support sites, respectively, clearly contradicts the carbon-to-
surface-metal ratios on coked catalysts that are usually much lar-
ger than one. To reconcile this discrepancy, it may be argued that
the two TPO peaks correspond to chemically distinct coke. For
example, it is plausible that acidic supports such as Al2O3 are reac-

483
tive toward unsaturated bonds and form carbonaceous deposits
which are chemically distinct from those on the metal sites. Coke
on the acidic sites can form either directly from gaseous species
or from the species that spill over onto the support from the metal.
However, the fact that multiple TPO peaks are also observed on the
inert and basic supports suggests that multiplicity of TPO peaks
can result from other factors such as the mobility of the surface
species that participate in coke formation and oxidation.
In this study, a supported Pt catalyst that is expected to form
exclusively graphene-like coke was used as a model to exclude
the inﬂuence of other types of coke. The mobility of surface species
during the formation and burning of graphene was revealed using
a combination of temperature- and time-resolved experiments,
TEM imaging of coked and partially regenerated catalysts, as well
as ab initio DFT modeling of relevant elementary steps. Unlike pre-
vious reports focusing primarily on fully-formed graphene depos-
its, this study also characterizes the initial stages of carbon
deposition and burning in order to elucidate the mobility of surface
species in more detail.
2. Experimental and theoretical methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation and ex situ characterization
A 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation
of toluene Pt(acac)2 solution onto calcined Mg(Al)Ox support,
which in turn was prepared by co-precipitation of Mg and Al salts.
The catalyst used in this study contained 0.48% Pt, as determined
by ICP, and had a BET speciﬁc area of 150 m2/g measured using a
Micromeritics Gemini V automated system. Prior to the measure-
ment of the surface area the samples were degassed at 573 K for
3 h. A sieve fraction of 250 < d < 450 lm was used in all experi-
ments reported. The details of the catalyst preparation method
and additional XRD, XAS, and TEM characterizations of similar cat-
alysts can be found in earlier publications [33,40,41]. For the cata-
lysts employed in this study, the Pt particle dispersion was
determined by H2 chemisorption as 63%, which corresponded well
to the most abundant particle size (1.5 nm, 60% particle dispersion)
according to TEM.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
was used for structural analysis of (i) coked catalytic samples after
propane dehydrogenation and (ii) coked samples that subse-
quently
underwent
partial
oxidative
regeneration
(one-peak
burn-off). A JEOL JEM-2200FS FEG TEM, equipped with spherical
aberration corrector of objective lens (Cs corrector, CETCOR by
CEOS-GmbH) operated at 200 kV was used. Aberration corrected
TEM allows electron wave amplitude contrast regime instead of
phase contrast and, thus cancels contrast ‘‘delocalization”, typical
for non-corrected HRTEMs (superposition of ‘‘ghost” images of
the lattice fringes and atomic columns, requiring mandatory com-
puter aided contrast simulation for physically relevant interpreta-
tion of experimental images). Cs-corrected TEM allows direct
measurements of interplanar and interatomic distances. In ampli-
tude contrast regime dark areas represent distribution of crystal
potential and bright areas – incident electron beam channeling
through the potential. Spatial resolution of the TEM approaches
information transfer limit and equals 0.13 nm. Actual atomic reso-
lution on the images was limited predominantly by random orien-
tation of crystals (atomic columns are not collinear with an
incident electron beam). TEM samples were prepared by the
immersion of lacey carbon ﬁlm on a copper support grid into cat-
alyst powders. Raman analysis of the fresh, coked, and partially
regenerated samples was performed on a RXN1 Raman spectrom-
eter (Kaiser Optical Systems) ﬁtted with a 532 nm laser operating
at 40 mW and a 5 m optical probe.
2.2. Flow experiments
Coking and coke burn-off ﬂow experiments were performed
using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer
equipped with an internal TCD detector, the efﬂuent of which
was connected to an external Pfeiffer Quadstar MS. All gases were
purchased from Air Liquid. For each experiment, 0.2 g of the cata-
lyst sample (sieve fraction 250 < d < 500 lm) was placed inside a
U-shaped quartz reactor between two quartz wool plugs. The cat-
alyst was heated to 923 K in 60 cm3/min ﬂow of 5% H2 (N40)
diluted in Ar (N46). Several reduction/oxidation cycles were per-
formed at this temperature prior to the coking experiment in order
to stabilize the catalyst. Then, to produce coke on the catalyst sur-
face, the ﬂow was switched to 2.25 lmol/s of C3H8 (60 Ncm3/min
of 5% C3H8 (N35) diluted in a1-He) for 15 min. Propane, propylene,
methane, hydrogen, and helium responses were monitored by MS
at 29, 41, 16, 2, and 4 amu, respectively. These responses are
reported as Site Time Yields (STY, mol s1 molPt,s
1 ) calculated as
the difference in the inlet and outlet molar ﬂow rates, as measured
relative to an internal standard (Ar) using an online quadrupole
mass spectrometer, i.e. Yi = (F0,i  Fi)/NPt,s, where Fi (mol s1) is
the molar ﬂow rate of component i, and NPt,s, (molPt,s) is the
amount of exposed (surface) Pt atoms in the sample. The catalyst
was subsequently cooled to room temperature in He, after which
the ﬂow was switched to 45 lmol/s of pure O2 (60 Ncm3/min of
a1-O2) for the TPO measurement. Then, the temperature was lin-
early increased at 5 K/min up to 923 K, while monitoring the CO2
signal at 44 amu.
Fully coked samples for TEM imaging were prepared using a
similar coking procedure (15 min in 5% C3H8 ﬂow at 923 K). To pre-
pare partially regenerated samples, the coking was followed by an
incomplete TPO treatment that was interrupted when the ﬁrst CO2
peak was already complete (700 K), and before the emergence of
the second CO2 peak. After the ﬁrst CO2 peak, the catalyst was
rapidly quenched in ice water to prevent coke degradation. The
quenched samples were either extracted for ex situ TEM imaging
or reduced in H2 and then subjected to another C3H8 treatment
in order to reveal their dehydrogenation activity.
2.3. Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) pulse-response experiments
Pulse-response TAP measurements were performed in a TAP-3E
instrument (Mithra Technologies, St. Louis, USA) equipped with an
Extrel Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS). The details of TAP
experiments, typically performed under the Knudsen transport
regime, and the corresponding data analysis can be found in
Gleaves et al. [42]. In brief, 15 mg (250 < d < 500 lm sieve fraction)
of the calcined 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst was loaded into a stainless
steel microreactor (£4 mm) as a thin-zone [43] of 1.5 mm in
length, which was located between two inert beds of acid-
washed quartz particles (same sieve fraction). The temperature
of the catalyst was measured by a K-type thermocouple housed
inside a steel well in the middle of the catalytic zone. Prior to the
low pressure pulse-response experiments, the catalyst was heated
to 923 K in a 15 lmol/s ﬂow of pure H2 (N40, 20 Ncm3/min,
101.325 kPa). After 15 min at the target temperature, the ﬂow
was switched to 3 lmol/s of O2 (20% a1-O2 in N2, 20 Ncm3/min,
101.325 kPa) for 15 min, which was followed by another 15 min
reductive treatment in H2. After a reduction/oxidation ﬂow treat-
ment, the microreactor was evacuated to the background pressure
of 106 torr and maintained at 923 K for 30 min to desorb the
remaining hydrogen from the surface.
The prepared reduced catalyst was subjected to a series of 400
small (5  109 mol) pulses consisting of 25% C3H8 (N35) and 75%
He (a2), while the following masses were monitored by QMS, one
amu per pulse: 2, 16, 29, 41, and 4. Data were recorded with mil-
484
E.A. Redekop et al. / Journal of Catalysis 344 (2016) 482–495
lisecond time resolution for 10 s within each pulse. Additionally,
amu 26 and 30 were recorded during some experiments in order
to assess the presence of C2 products, but no surplus C2 was
detected above the level of impurities in the feed mixture. C3H8,
C3H6, CH4, H2, and He were also pulsed over the inert quartz bed
for calibration.
Two types of experiments were performed immediately after
this coking pretreatment. In the time-delay experiments, the same
C3H8/He mixture was pulsed in shorter (40–50 pulses) sequences
with an increasing time delay between the end of the preceding
sequence and the beginning of the new sequence. The time delay
between the last pulse of the preceding sequence and the ﬁrst
pulse of the new sequence was varied between 11 s and 610 s. In
the coke burn-off experiments, a sequence of synthetic air pulses
was admitted into the microreactor while monitoring the CO2 sig-
nal at amu 44. The burn-off sequence proceeded until CO2 no
longer evolved from the catalyst (100 pulses).
2.4. DFT calculations
Periodic DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna
ab initio simulation package (VASP) [44]. Geometries and electronic
energies of adsorbed species and transition states were calculated
at 0 K. Thermochemical values were calculated based on vibra-
tional analyses in the harmonic oscillator approximation at
900 K, which can accurately be applied in the temperature range
of 850 K to 950 K. The non-local optPBE vdw-DF functional [45]
was used for DFT calculations. This functional takes into account
non-local interactions, such as van der Waals forces, in contrast
to the regularly applied GGA-PBE or PW91 functionals which were
used in earlier studies on propane dehydrogenation [46,47]. DFT
calculations were performed with the projector augmented wave
method (PAW) [48] and a 400 eV plane-wave cutoff kinetic energy.
The ﬁrst-order Methfessel Paxton method and a smearing width of
0.2 eV were used to describe the partial occupancies close to the
Fermi level.
The Pt(111) surface was represented using a 4  2 unit cell that
consists of four Pt-layers in the c-direction, with a vacuum layer of
12 Å between the slabs. Brillouin zone integration for surface slab
calculations on Pt(111) utilized a 3  5  1 Monkhorst-Pack grid
[49]. The Pt lattice parameter of 2.82 Å was obtained from a bulk
optimization of an fcc unit cell using the optPBE vdw-DF functional
at an increased energy cutoff of 520 eV and on a 15  15  15
Monkhorst-Pack grid. The Pt(211) surface was represented using
a 3  2 unit cell and a vacuum layer of 12 Å. The unit cell consisted
of 4 Pt-layers in the c-direction, and the undercoordinated site
(step) was located in the a-direction. Finally, the Pt(111) + Gra-
phene surface was constructed by adsorbing a one-dimensional
graphene ribbon on the Pt(111) surface, which is possible since
the graphene ribbon has similar lattice parameters as the 4  2
unit cell for Pt(111) (vacuum layer of 12 Å). The graphene ribbon
on the surface results in a limited number of Pt surface atoms
available for adsorption. Gas-phase calculations were performed
in a 20  20  20 unit cell, considering only the C point in recipro-
cal space.
The Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method [50] was used to calcu-
late the minimum energy path between optimized reactants and
products. The approximate geometry of the saddle point resulting
from a rough NEB calculation was further reﬁned in a Dimer calcu-
lation, which is an effective method to ﬁnd the energy and conﬁg-
uration of the transition state [51]. Vibrational analyses were used
to verify the validity of the transition states, with a single imagi-
nary frequency in the spectrum, and to calculate activation enthal-
pies and entropies. Based on these calculations, rate and diffusion
coefﬁcients were obtained from the Transition State Theory (see SI)
at a temperature of 923 K.
3. Results
3.1. Coke formation and oxidation in ﬂow experiments
Upon exposure of the freshly reduced 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst
to the C3H8/Ar ﬂow at 923 K, the outlet stream contained C3H6, H2,
CH4, and unreacted C3H8. Transient responses (Fig. 1a) exhibited an
initial unselective period of methane and hydrogen generation
lasting 1 min, which was followed by a sharp decline in CH4 gen-
eration and a gradual increase in selectivity toward C3H6.
The propane feed was then discontinued after 20 min on
stream, and the catalyst was cooled in He to room temperature,
after which the carbonaceous deposits were subjected to O2 TPO.
In one set of experiments, the temperature was linearly raised to
923 K at a rate of 5 K/min, while ﬂowing O2. CO2 evolved in two
distinct peaks with maximums at 646 and 797 K (Fig. 1b). It should
be noted that the CO2 that was pre-adsorbed on the catalyst from
the air was completely removed during the high-temperature
reductive pretreatment, and all CO2 evolving from the catalyst dur-
ing TPO was ascribed to the oxidation of carbon deposits. After
TPO, the catalyst was reduced in H2 at 923 K, and another C3H8
treatment was performed to determine whether the catalytic
activity was restored by the TPO/reduction cycle. The resulting
transients (Fig. 1c) demonstrated that the activity and the charac-
teristic selectivity pattern of the fresh catalyst were indeed mostly
restored by the regeneration. In another set of experiments, the
temperature ramp was stopped at 700 K, after the evolution of
the ﬁrst CO2 peak, but before the start of the second peak
(Fig. 1d). The subsequent C3H8 treatment produced the transients
depicted in Fig. 1e, which indicate that a signiﬁcant portion of
the catalytic activity and the selectivity patterns were restored
even by the incomplete TPO treatment.
3.2. Ex situ characterization of carbonaceous deposits
The nanostructure of coked Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst is shown on
HRTEM images in Fig. 2. Three morphological features are clearly
distinguished. Firstly, the underlying support appears as platelets
with pronounced crystallinity, which is ascribed to distorted cubic
MgO [27] (Fig. 2a). Secondly, individual Pt nanoparticles of various
sizes are visible as highly crystalline, dark, globular features
(Fig. 2a and b). The distribution of particle size is dominated by
small 1.5–2 nm particles, but a few elongated particles approxi-
mately 5 nm in cross section and 15 nm in length are also present
(Fig. 2e). It should be noted that these larger particles exhibit a rel-
atively high aspect ratio compared to the more spherical 20–50 nm
particles reported in Redekop et al. [33] who examined similar cat-
alysts with 5 wt.% Pt loading. The large particles with low aspect
ratio in the reported 5 wt.% Pt samples originated from the crystal-
lites of dried Pt precursor remaining after the synthesis procedure.
The longer particles observed here could instead result from the
preferential growth of Pt along defects in the crystal lattice of the
underlying support, such as the interlayer faults of the original
LDH framework.
The third type of morphology in Fig. 2 is composed of carbona-
ceous deposits that are spread over the catalyst surface. These
deposits have a multilayered structure comprised of extended,
highly defective graphene sheets. The sheets located in the vicinity
of small Pt nanoparticles are attached to the Pt surface at one end,
while the rest of their mass extends further onto the support sur-
face (see Fig. 2d). On the support, the sheets are folded into rippled,
highly entangled conglomerates such as those in Fig. 2c. In these
images the carbonaceous deposits covering the support surface
appear to be very irregular. Nevertheless, we assign such deposits
primarily to graphitic carbon rather than amorphous coke on the

basis of several considerations. First, multiple representative
images demonstrate continuous transition of ﬂat graphene sheets
originating on Pt particles into entangled deposits located further
away on the support, as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 2d. It is
unlikely that the deposits lose their local graphene structure
(hexagonal honeycomb lattice of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms)
during this gradual shift onto the support, although their extended
well-ordered nature is clearly lost. Second, the inter-layer distance
of 0.366 nm between these entangled sheets (see Fig. 2c) was
within the expected range of {002} interlayer spacing in pristine
graphite (0.335 nm) [54]. Finally, the parallel formation of amor-
phous coke on the support is unlikely due to the overall basicity
of the MgO-dominated lattice, although the presence of more
acidic Al-enriched regions cannot be excluded. Overall, the coke

morphology was consistent with deformed graphene sheets, which
will be referenced to as graphene-like coke. The sheets located in
the vicinity of larger Pt nanoparticles form an onion-like structure
of stacked layers which completely encapsulate the host Pt
nanoparticles
(Fig.
2e). The interlayer distance of 0.355 nm
between these encapsulating sheets is slightly smaller compared
to the distance of 0.366 nm between the entangled sheets originat-
ing from smaller Pt nanoparticles.
The assignment of carbonaceous deposits to graphene is further
substantiated by a Raman analysis presented in Fig. 3. The spec-
trum corresponding to the coked sample exhibits two intense
peaks at 1340 and 1600 cm1 which can be attributed to the char-
acteristic D- and G-bands of graphene [55], respectively. The
approximate ratio of integrated intensities amounts to ID/IG  1.5
(see SI, Fig. S5).
The
same
morphological
features
(support
platelets,
Pt
nanoparticles, and graphene sheets) appear on the partially regen-
erated catalyst samples collected after incomplete TPO treatments
(see Fig. 3). However, when compared to the fully coked samples,
several pronounced differences should be noted. The graphene
sheets previously extending from the small Pt particles are mostly
absent (Fig. 4b), except for isolated packets of entangled conglom-
erates that remain in certain areas (Fig. 4c). The encapsulating gra-
phitic layers around larger Pt nanoparticles appear practically
intact (Fig. 3d). The size distribution of Pt particles has shifted
slightly upward at the expense of small 1.5 nm particles which
now reach 2–3 nm on average. TEM images of the completely
regenerated sample were very similar to the carbon-free areas of
the partially regenerated sample (see Fig. S1), except that no car-
bon deposits could be found on the inspected Pt particles and the
support
surface.
The
average
diameter
of
Pt
nanoparticles
increased to 3–4 nm.
3.3. TAP experiments
3.3.1. Pulsed coking with C3H8
The initial stages of coke formation during propane dehydro-
genation and subsequent oxidative regeneration of 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)
Ox were characterized using isothermal TAP pulse-response exper-
iments. To produce coke, a pretreated fresh catalyst was heated to
the target temperature of 923 K and was subjected to a series of
C3H8/Ar pulses (Fig. 5a–d). The exit-ﬂow rates of propane, propy-
lene, hydrogen, and methane exhibited rapid changes during the
initial 400 pulses, until all responses became stable and did not
change from one pulse to the next. C3H8 conversion and the yields
of C3H6, H2, and CH4 (per molecule of C3H8 converted) are plotted
in Fig. 5e as functions of the number of injected C3H8/He pulses.
Propane was almost completely converted at the beginning of
the sequence, but then the conversion decreased and plateaued
around 5–10% by the end of the sequence. During the initial pulses,
C3H8 was converted mostly into hydrogen (Fig. 5c) and methane
(Fig. 5d), but there was no propylene egressing from the reactor.
C3H6 selectivity gradually increased toward the end of the
sequence until it was the only carbon-containing product observed
(Fig. 5b). After the deactivation of active sites, the residual dehy-
drogenation activity toward propylene in TAP experiments was
very low in comparison with ﬂow experiments. Concurrently,
methane generation sharply declined and ceased completely by
pulse 200. Hydrogen generation also declined after passing
through an initial maximum and then stabilized by the end of
the pulse sequence. The combined estimated amount of hydrogen
atoms in H2, CH4, and C3H6 exceeded the amount of hydrogen
atoms in converted C3H8. This discrepancy can be attributed to
poor quantiﬁcation of H2 by the QMS. Carbon-containing species
were quantiﬁed more reliably (within 10% error). The amount of
carbon deposited on the catalyst surface was evaluated by calculat-
ing the residual between the amount of carbon delivered to the
catalyst by converted C3H8 and the combined amount of carbon
which has left the catalyst with methane and propylene. Fig. 5f
depicts the cumulative carbon deposition per mole of exposed Pt
atoms as a function of injected C3H8/He pulses. Carbon deposition
approached a limit of 2.5 molC/molPt,s by the end of the sequence.
TEM images of the resulting nascent carbon deposits are shown in
Fig. S2, where a thin (<0.5 nm) shell of carbon can be distinguished
around 10 nm nanoparticles.
3.3.2. Variable delay between C3H8 pulsing sequences
Having established that the catalyst activity toward propane
decomposition
is
effectively
suppressed
by
the
buildup
of
graphene-like coke on the catalyst, it was possible to use this
highly structure-sensitive side reaction as a probe to assess the
availability of Pt sites that remained uncovered by graphene-like
coke or by its precursors. In the next set of experiments, sequential
series of several C3H8/Ar pulses were separated by a time delay
which was varied between several seconds and several minutes.
In Fig. 6 the results of the time-delay experiments are presented
in chronological order from left to right. Unlike in Fig. 5a–d, the
time axis is now contiguous instead of being stacked in the third
dimension of individual pulse-periods. Only those signals that
exhibited pronounced changes in this experiment, namely C3H8
(amu 29) and H2 (amu 2), are shown. Nevertheless, it is important
to keep in mind that the same four mass fragments were recorded
in total as in the previous experiment (see Section 2.3). At the far
left, the pretreatment coking sequence is shown as a dense, com-
pressed collection of responses. This sequence was described in
the previous section and is not discussed here in detail (see
Fig. 5a–d). The exit-ﬂow rates of C3H8 and H2 leveled out by the
end of the pretreatment sequence due to partial coking, indicating
that the pretreatment resulted in a coked catalyst state with resid-
ual low activity toward propane decomposition and dehydrogena-
tion, as discussed previously.
The ﬁrst delayed sequence commenced only 1 s after the end of
the initial propane sequence in which the coked catalyst state was
prepared. Thus, the total delay between pulses was only 11 s. The
exit ﬂow rates of both C3H8 and H2 remained unchanged compared
to the end of this initial propane sequence. When the separation
between the consecutive sequences was increased to 40 s, the ﬁrst
H2 response clearly exceeded the plateau, but the excess decayed
before the second recorded H2 response. Evidently, the catalyst
state had been altered in between the two pulse sequences, and
for a short period of time it was more active toward propane. It
can be noted that the ﬁrst recorded C3H8 response within the same
Fig. 3. Ex situ Raman spectra of the fresh (bottom), partially-regenerated (middle),
and fully coked (top) 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts.

487
sequence (Dt = 40 s) did not demonstrate deviations from the pre-
viously observed plateau level. This ﬁrst C3H8 response was
recorded during the third pulse of the sequence, after H2 and He
responses, because only one amu per pulse can be detected by a
QMS. Thus, the catalyst state that caused the surplus H2 production
during the ﬁrst pulse had decayed by the third pulse in the
sequence. Further increase in the inter-sequence delay to 130 s
led not only to a pronounced over-production of hydrogen during
the ﬁrst pulse, but also to a decrease in the amount of egressing
propane during the third pulse. The decay of the initial catalyst
activity back to the plateau occurred in this sequence only by the
fourth recorded H2 response (pulse 13). Similar results, but with
much longer activity decay were observed after a 610 s inter-
sequence pause. On the far right of Fig. 6, the gradual decay in
activity is visible in both H2 and C3H8 responses. Methane genera-
tion was also observed during the ﬁrst few pulses, but it was
insigniﬁcant compared to methane generation on the fresh cata-
lyst, suggesting that the uncoordinated sites and large Pt ensem-
bles required for hydrogenolysis remained blocked by previously
deposited coke. For each inter-sequence delay, the amount of sur-
face Pt that was uncovered can be evaluated from the amount of
carbon deposited within the following pulse sequence until pro-
pane consumption decayed again. As shown in Fig. 7, the amount
of uncovered Pt sites increased nonlinearly with the increasing
delay and trended toward a limiting value.
3.3.3. Isothermal pulsed oxidation of coke with O2
After the catalyst was coked by a C3H8/Ar sequence of 400
pulses, a series of pulses containing synthetic air was admitted at
923 K to burn off the carbon deposits. The emitted CO2 was moni-
tored at amu 44 (see Fig. 8). The CO2 response during the very ﬁrst
oxygen pulse was dominated by a peak with a sharp maximum
emerging at around 0.5 s, but it also exhibited a shoulder emerging
0.5 s later. As more oxygen pulses were admitted into the microre-
actor, the main peak appeared at an approximately constant time,
but with gradually decreasing intensity. The shoulder, on the con-
trary, shifted to progressively later times, as shown in Fig. 8b. This
shoulder had a slowly decaying tail, which by the 6th pulse in the
sequence became so long that it could not be fully egressed within
a maximal possible inter-pulse collection time of 20 s (limited by
the data acquisition software). In fact, the ever increasing delay
between the incoming oxygen pulse and the emergence of the
shoulder eventually led to an apparent overlap between the
delayed tail of the shoulder from a previous pulse and the newly
generated main peak of the following pulse. The intensity of the
shoulder gradually fell beyond the limit of detection after the
admission of 20 oxygen pulses, while small amounts of CO2 in
the main peak continued to emerge at a constant time for another
100 oxygen pulses. Attempts were made to systematically repeat
the isothermal pulsed oxidation at various temperatures in order
to evaluate characteristic activation energies for the main peak
and the shoulder, but no meaningful parameters could be esti-
mated due to the sporadic rate at which the shoulder shifted in
time and the irreproducible ratio between the relative amounts
of CO2 produced in the main peak and the shoulder. Nevertheless,
the presence of the shoulder and the temporal behavior of CO2
were always qualitatively reproducible.
3.4. DFT calculations
Partial coking of the catalytic surface clearly has a profound
effect on the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. Time-delay

488

TAP experiments demonstrated that this partial coking may be
spontaneously alleviated by uncovering of active sites during the
initial stages (see Fig. 6). Several candidate pathways were evalu-
ated using periodic DFT to clarify the mechanism of the sponta-
neous uncovering of Pt sites that were blocked during C3H8
dehydrogenation. The site-blocking species were presupposed to
consist of propylidyne (C3H5), adsorbed product (C3H6), or C1 spe-
cies. In the absence of gaseous reagents, site-blocking C3H5 could
eventually hydrogenate into C3H6 which could, in turn, either des-
orb into the gas phase as propylene or decompose into C1 frag-
ments. The characteristic timescales for these processes were
estimated based on the DFT-derived rate coefﬁcients. These esti-
mated timescales were compared to the experimentally observed
timescale of site release in time-delay TAP experiments in order
to determine which process was more likely to control the release
of active sites (see Section 4). Preliminary DFT and microkinetic
calculations were used to estimate the timescale for the complex
reaction network of C3-to-C1 conversion. The estimated timescale
of this C3-to-C1 process is brieﬂy discussed in relation to other
timescales.
3.4.1. Propylidyne hydrogenation into propylene
A
two-step
conversion
of
site-blocking
propylidyne
into
adsorbed propylene on the Pt(111) surface in the presence of sur-
face hydrogen was considered (Fig. 9): a ﬁrst step hydrogenates
propylidyne
to
1-propylidene
and
a
second
step
converts
1-propylidene into its isomer propylene. The calculated activation
energies and rate coefﬁcients for these reactions are reported in
Table 1. In the worst case scenario of very low local hydrogen cover-
age (0.01), the ﬁrst step will be rate determining with a character-
istic timescale of s  2.5  105 s, where s  1/(k  hH). In the best
case scenario of high local hydrogen coverage, the second step will
be rate determining with a characteristic timescale of s  1  106 s.
3.4.2. Propylene desorption
Propylene adsorption was evaluated on three different Pt sur-
faces: Pt(111), Pt(211), and Pt(111) pre-covered with graphene.
In agreement with Zaera and Chrysostomou [56], calculations sug-
gest that propylene adsorbs in a di-r conﬁguration (Fig. 10). Calcu-
lated adsorption energies are listed in Table 2. Propylene binds
more strongly to the step atoms of the Pt(211) surface, 25 kJ/mol

stronger than on Pt(111), while the close proximity of a graphene
ribbon weakens propylene adsorption signiﬁcantly in comparison
with Pt(111). Therefore, propylene desorption from the Pt(211)
surface provides an upper bound for estimating the timescale of
desorption. The timescale of the 1st-order propylene desorption
can be estimated as sdes  1/kdes, where kdes (1/s) is the desorption
rate coefﬁcient given for non-activated adsorption by kdes = k0exp
((DEads)/RT) [57]. The desorption rate coefﬁcient at 923 K was
calculated to be 11.4  103 (1/s) (see SI), resulting in a desorption
timescale of 104 (s).
3.4.3. Surface diffusion of C1 species
Diffusion pathways of two C1 species, CH2Pt2 and CPt4, were
approximated by their hopping between two stable positions on
the Pt(111) surface. The minimum energy pathways between the
two stable states were obtained using the NEB method. The start-
ing point for each species was the most stable adsorption state, and
species were allowed to move to the closest metastable position:
CH2Pt hopped from the bridge position to the top position and
CPt4 hopped from the fcc position, through the bridge, to the hcp
position. From these metastable sites, the adsorbed species can
directly migrate further to the next stable site on the surface,
and therefore the studied minimum energy pathways allow the
study of diffusion over the surface. For the two species, the diffu-
sion barriers from the stable to the metastable site were, calculated
using the NEB method, to be 75 and 70 kJ/mol, respectively, which
translated to an approximated surface diffusion coefﬁcient of 6.3–
6.6  1012 m2/s at 923 K (see SI, Table S1, and Fig. S7). For a single
diffusive jump between the sites of 1  1010 m, the approximate
timescale of diffusion amounts to less than 108 s based on the Ein-
stein equation ðsdiff  l2=DÞ. One or several such jump events
should be enough to free the active Pt site initially occupied by a
C1 fragment. Based on these simple estimations, it can be con-
cluded that C1 diffusion across an empty Pt(111) surface is rather
fast and cannot account for the minute-long uncovering of Pt sites
observed in TAP experiments. We expect the diffusion on the Pt
(211) surface to be slightly slower due to stronger binding of C1
fragments, but not slow enough to affect the overall conclusions.
However, surface coverage by other intermediates and by pre-
formed carbon deposits may signiﬁcantly hinder diffusion due to
steric limitations and, therefore, increase the role of C1 diffusion
in determining the rate of site-uncovering. More accurate model-
ing of such processes on densely covered surfaces, e.g. via a combi-
nation of ab initio and kinetic Monte Carlo methods, would provide
a valuable extension of the present work, but it was outside the
scope of this paper.
4. Discussion
In agreement with previous studies [33], the concentration
transients at atmospheric pressure (Fig. 1a) and the TAP exit-ﬂow
rates (Fig. 5a–d) indicate that the buildup of coke on the 0.5%Pt/Mg
(Al)Ox catalyst results in sequential hindering of catalytic reac-

tions: ﬁrst hydrogenolysis of C3H8 into CH4, then C3H8 dehydro-
genation into C3H6, and ﬁnally decomposition of C3H8 into coke
and H2. An extrinsic relaxation period can be clearly distinguished
in the beginning of these transient experiments, i.e. when the cat-
alyst changes in response to the reaction environment [58]. These
transients are consistent with the following overall mechanism of
propane dehydrogenation. The cascade of reactions is initiated by
dissociative
chemisorption
and
stepwise
dehydrogenation
of
C3H8 into C3Hn species (n = 3–7). The overall selectivity of the
process is determined by the competition between desorption of
the partially dehydrogenated C3H6 species as gas-phase propylene
– the target product – and deeper dehydrogenation of C3H6. These
reactions are accompanied by CAC bond scission giving rise to C1
and C2 species. C1 species may form gas-phase CH4 or participate
in further reactions on the surface. C2 species may desorb as
C2H6 or C2H4. The absence of these products in the experiments
reported
here
can
be
attributed
to
their
rapid
secondary
hydrogenolysis and decomposition. Concurrent side reactions of
C1–3 species lead to the formation of carbonaceous deposits which
gradually deactivate the catalyst by blocking the active sites. Some
of the aforementioned reactions, such as CAC scission, are highly
structure-sensitive, while others, like dehydrogenation [52,53],
are less structure-sensitive. Consequently, the balance between
these reactions is affected by the relative populations of various
types of Pt sites exposed by faceted nanoparticles on the catalyst
surface. These changes are reﬂected in Fig. 1a by the selectivity
shift during the extrinsic relaxation period from hydrogenolysis
to dehydrogenation.
Low-coordinated Pt sites, such as corners, edges, and kinks, are
very active in CAC scission. But these sites also bind deeply dehy-
drogenated
carbonaceous
species
stronger
than
the
highly-
coordinated Pt sites typically found on terraces. Therefore, these
low-coordinated sites are most probably poisoned ﬁrst, increasing
C3H6 selectivity. As the coke deposits grow, the average size of
exposed Pt ensembles on the atomic steps and terraces must also
decrease, further hindering unselective CAC scission. Eventually,
methane generation stops completely as a result of coking. How-
ever, the deposition of carbon continues, albeit at a slower rate,
as evidenced by continuing generation of extra-stoichiometric
hydrogen and by previously reported data on the amount of depos-
ited coke vs. time-on-stream [29]. TEM images in Fig. 2 clearly
demonstrate that carbonaceous deposits continue to grow well
beyond a C/Pt ratio of 1 by shifting onto the support surface. These
observations corroborate the classical results of Boudart et al. [16],
Sinfelt [17], and Somorjai and Blakely [14] which differentiated the
structure sensitivities of hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation. The
residual activity of the coked catalyst can be tentatively attributed
to a small population of Pt sites which are still accessible to the gas
reagents despite extensive coking. Although we did not obtain
clear evidence of such sites in TEM images, their presence was
demonstrated in the literature [27] on small nm and sub-nm
particles.
The present results complement the studies by Peng et al. [27]
and Wu et al. [28] by examining coking behavior at very early as
well as more mature stages of the dehydrogenation process. Very
early stages of coking were characterized by TAP pulse-response
experiments which elucidated the C3H8 interaction with the
freshly reduced catalyst on a much shorter (<1 s) timescale and
with better control over the amount of coke deposited per pulse
than in conventional ﬂow experiments. TAP experiments repro-
duced the selectivity behavior during the onset of coking, i.e. the
extinction of methane generation and the increase in propylene
production (Fig. 5a–d). The pulse-wise gradual coking of Pt sites
in TAP experiments is analogous to the kinetic studies by Menon
et al. [59] and Shum et al. [60] in which Pt sites were gradually

poisoned by sulfur, leading to the hindrance of hydrogenolysis and
selectivity enhancements.
TAP experiments were also able to capture the dynamic pro-
cesses involving carbon and Pt atoms on the catalytic surface in
the absence of gaseous reagents (Fig. 6). When the delay between
sequential pulse sequences was longer than a few seconds, the ﬁrst
several pulses of the resumed sequence demonstrated increased
C3H8 consumption and extra-stoichiometric H2 release in compar-
ison with the last pulses of the preceding interrupted sequence. This
suggests that previously blocked Pt sites responsible for unselective
reactions were spontaneously uncovered or otherwise regenerated
during the inter-sequence pause. Several hypotheses can be put
forth to explain the observed uncovering of unselective Pt sites: (i)
desorption of site-blocking species into the gas-phase, (ii) dissolu-
tion of site-blocking carbon atoms into Pt nanoparticles, (iii) migra-
tion of coke precursors away from the active sites, (iv) detachment
and migration of the entire graphene sheet away from Pt sites, and
(v) formation of new Pt sites due to surface restructuring.
The desorption of propylene into the gas phase, which accord-
ing to DFT calculations (see Section 3.4) occurs on a timescale of
104 s, cannot explain the uncovering of active sites between inter-
rupted pulsing sequences that occur on a timescale of minutes. In
agreement with these estimates, the tail of the propylene signal in
the TAP experiments (see SI, Fig. S3) did not display any signs of
continuing slow desorption beyond the collection time of a single
pulse. If the sites were blocked by more dehydrogenated species
such as propylidyne, these site-blocking species could be slowly
converted back to propylene by hydrogenation and would subse-
quently desorb, uncovering the sites. However, DFT results exclude
this possibility, since propylidyne hydrogenation is also predicted
to proceed on a sub-second timescale.
An alternative mechanism of the uncovering of active sites
involves the conversion of C3 species into C1 species that leave
the active sites either via dissolution into the deeper layers of Pt
nanoparticles or via surface diffusion away from the active sites.
The migration of elemental carbon into a Pt subsurface is unlikely
based on its limited solubility. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest
that coke precursors migrate away from the active Pt sites, where
they originate from the site-blocking C3 species, to a nearby site of
graphene
assembly.
This
hypothesis
is
supported
by
low-
temperature STM studies of carbon CVD on Pt(111) [20] and Cu
(111) surfaces [61], which clearly demonstrated that a wide vari-
ety of coke precursors, including single carbon atoms, dimers, rect-
angles, and ’zig-zag’ chains, may exist on the surface as mobile
species prior to their incorporation into graphene. Similarly, Logi-
nova et al. [62] concluded that on Ru(0001) surfaces graphene
grows by the attachment of carbon pentamers rather than individ-
ual adatoms. It remains unclear whether the migrating species in
our case are C1 or higher fragments. DFT estimations (see Sec-
tion 3.4.3) predict the timescale of C1 hopping between two adja-
cent Pt sites to be <108 s. Although these calculations do not
take into account signiﬁcant coverage of the surface by preexisting
graphene sheets, which can introduce additional transport limita-
tions, the hopping of C1 alone appears to be fast and cannot explain
the overall timescale of site-uncovering. Preliminary DFT-based
microkinetic calculations predict the timescale of decomposition
of dehydrogenated C3 into dehydrogenated C1 species to be
1 min,
suggesting
that
C3
to
C1
conversion
is
the
rate-
determining step of this mechanism. This timescale closely
matches the observed timescale of spontaneous site-uncovering
in TAP experiments. It is also possible that the actual entities that
migrate away from the active sites and later incorporate into the
graphene sheet are not C1, but are more slowly diffusing C2 or C3
species. This interpretation would be consistent with the calcula-
tions showing that C1 must cross a higher barrier for their incorpo-
ration into graphene than dimers or trimers [63,64].
The fourth hypothesis that could explain the uncovering of
active sites is the continuous migration of entire graphene sheets
away from the active sites. Graphene may grow from some Pt sites
while reactants are continuously supplied from the gas phase. It
may then detach and shift to the support when the pulsing is
stopped. Numerous studies [65,66] have shown that peripheral
carbon atoms at the edges of graphene islands and nanotubes
attach very ﬁrmly to metal surfaces. It is unlikely that spontaneous
migration of entire graphene sheets away from Pt surfaces could
generate signiﬁcant energy gain to enable rupture of the PtAC
bonds.
Finally, the peripheral Pt atoms with the graphene sheet still
attached may shift with respect to the underlying layer of Pt atoms
as part of surface restructuring, since PtAPt bonds within small
nanoparticles may be weaker than PtAC bonds at their surfaces
[67,68]. In situ TEM studies [69,28] have indicated that Pt and Pt-
based alloyed nanocrystals assume a liquid-like state at elevated
temperatures and undergo extensive restructuring. If such shifts
of Pt layers indeed occur, they may lead to the formation of new
Pt sites that account for the renewed catalytic activity after the
pulsing pause in TAP experiments. Indirect evidence of the forma-
tion of new Pt sites due to surface restructuring can be gleaned
from the quantitative analysis of coke deposition during pulse-
delay TAP experiments. It took 400 pulses in the initial catalyst
deactivation sequence (Fig. 5) to hinder C3H8 conversion from
nearly one to nearly zero, during which 2.5 molC/molPt,s was
deposited. The amount of Pt sites that were spontaneously uncov-
ered in the inter-pulsing pauses can be approximated to the ﬁrst
order by the amount of carbon that these uncovered sites later
retained in the subsequent short pulse sequences (Fig. 7). The
uncovered carbon sinks grew as a function of inter-sequence delay,
but
their
capacity
remained
an
order
of
magnitude
lower
(0.16 molC/molPt,s after 610 s delay) than the carbon capacity ﬁlled
during the initial 400 pulse sequence. Yet, the uncovered Pt sites
surprisingly exhibited nearly complete C3H8 conversion during
the ﬁrst few pulses. It then took less than 50 pulses to diminish this
regained activity back to the same stable (<10%) residual conver-
sion (Fig. 6). It is reasonable to suggest that the Pt sites that were
made available (e.g. by surface restructuring) during the inter-
sequence delays differed in nature and activity from the sites orig-
inally present on the fresh catalyst.
Some of the hypothetical mechanisms discussed above cannot
be ruled out completely based on our data alone, motivating fur-
ther time-resolved studies of coke deposition on suitable materials
in order to facilitate kinetic and/or spectroscopic elucidation of rel-
evant reaction steps. Based on limited data, we conclude that the
C3-to-C1 conversion, followed by surface mobility of graphene pre-
cursors before they can assimilate into the growing graphene
sheet, is the most likely explanation of the observed uncovering
of Pt sites between delayed consecutive pulse sequences. This
mechanistic proposal is in agreement with several theoretical
[22,63] and experimental [70] studies which conﬁrm the preva-
lence of small carbon clusters as precursors to graphene on Pt sur-
faces. Another factor that most probably contributes to the
observed uncovering of Pt sites is signiﬁcant restructuring of Pt
surfaces caused by the interactions with carbon deposits. This con-
clusion lends additional experimental evidence to the earlier pro-
posal by Feng et al. [71] that ‘‘for practical materials such as Pt
nanoparticles used in alkane dehydrogenation, coking processes
likely will cause restructuring of the nanoparticles, with important
implications for catalytic activity.”
Signiﬁcantly later stages of carbon deposition were investigated
by ex situ TEM of thoroughly coked catalysts. The coke morphology
(Fig. 2b) can be described as graphene sheets growing from small
Pt nanoparticles onto the support or encapsulating large nanopar-
ticles in multilayered graphite-like structures. This is in agreement
492
E.A. Redekop et al. / Journal of Catalysis 344 (2016) 482–495
with Peng et al. [27], Wu et al. [28], and Biris et al. [72] who studied
carbon deposition on the MgO support with similar basicity. The
graphene that shifts onto the support undergoes severe deforma-
tion resulting in highly rippled and entangled conglomerates with
no apparent long-range order, but the local structure and inter-
layer spacing of the original graphene sheets are likely to be pre-
served. The carbonaceous deposits seen in TEM images may also
include carbon nanotubes such as those that were observed by
Peng et al. [27] and Biris et al. [72]. The assignment of coke to dis-
ordered graphene is consistent with Raman spectra (see Fig. 3).
Namely, the ratio of D and G band intensities for the coked sample
is 1.5, which is suggestive of the signiﬁcant disorder in graphene
[63]. It should be noted that some of the deformed graphene-like
coke agglomerates in Fig. 2 are morphologically similar to the Type
1 growth morphology and turbostratic CNTs identiﬁed by Kudo
et al. on the surface of zirconia nanoparticles [73]. Analogously to
Pt nanoparticles investigated here, Kudo at al. concluded that these
morphologies are characteristic of the surface-mediated mecha-
nism of carbon deposition.
Temperature-resolved oxidation of coked catalysts provided
additional insights into the differentiation of carbonaceous depos-
its resulting from their different locations on the catalyst surface.
Two well-separated CO2 peaks centered at 650 K and 800 K
were observed in TPO experiments (Fig. 1b). Despite substantial
morphology deformations, coke deposits on Mg(Al)Ox-supported
materials are exclusively graphene-like due to the mildly basic nat-
ure of Mg(Al)Ox which precludes the formation of coke via propy-
lene oligomerization. Therefore, both CO2 TPO peaks originate from
graphene. A temperature ramps up to an intermediate temperature
followed by rapid quenching was used to isolate the catalyst state
after the ﬁrst of the two TPO peaks. According to ex situ TEM (see
Fig. 4), the graphene sheets in the vicinity of small Pt nanoparticles
were readily oxidized (burned) at much lower temperatures than
the multilayered deposits encapsulating larger nanoparticles and
the entangled graphene sheets located in certain areas of the sup-
port surface. To interpret these differences, we must consider the
mechanism of coke oxidation on supported metal catalysts. The
activated oxygen required for coke burning originates on Pt
nanoparticles. Additional TPO experiments with pure graphite con-
ﬁrmed that in the absence of Pt, graphitic carbon deposits burn at
the much higher temperature of 1073 K (see SI, Fig. S6). Therefore,
it is likely that the spillover and surface-mediated transport of acti-
vated oxygen species are involved. We considered two potential
mechanisms that may be responsible for coke differentiation upon
oxidation: (i) surface mobility of activated oxygen species, and (ii)
mobility of Pt nanoparticles. Based on our data alone, we could not
exclude either of these mechanisms.
The ﬁrst mechanism begins by O2 dissociation on those few Pt
sites that remain exposed to the gas after deactivation. The same
sites are probably responsible for the residual C3H8 conversion.
The active oxygen species resulting from O2 dissociation begin to
burn graphene on the surrounding Pt surface. As graphene is
burned off, more Pt sites become available for oxygen activation.
Graphene in the immediate vicinity of Pt nanoparticles is also
rapidly oxidized by the spilled-over activated oxygen species
[74].
However,
with
gradually
increasing
distance
between
oxygen-dissociating Pt nanoparticles and available carbon on the
support surface, the transport of oxidizing species begins to play
a more prominent role in determining the overall rate. For yet
unidentiﬁed reasons, certain locations on the support surface even
remain inaccessible for the spilled-over oxidant, which would
explain the remaining graphene agglomerates seen in Fig. 4c. The
encapsulating layers around larger Pt nanoparticles survive oxida-
tion at lower temperature (Fig. 4d) because they completely block
the access of gas phase oxygen to the Pt surface. Diffusion limita-
tions are alleviated at higher temperatures, allowing the remaining
coke to burn. According to this mechanism, it can be concluded
that a double-peak TPO feature resulted from spatially non-
isotropic surface transport of activated oxygen toward the receding
front of burning carbon.
Isothermal pulsed oxidation in the TAP reactor further substan-
tiates the involvement of surface mobility in coke oxidation, which
results in the appearance of the CO2 shoulder and its rapid shift
toward later egress (Fig. 8). As discussed in Section 3.3, only the
very early stages of carbon deposits were investigated in these
experiments. The increasing delay of the CO2 shoulder suggests
that even at these early stages the deposited carbon extends away
from the Pt surface. The shifting of the CO2 shoulder could have
been explained by an additional post-oxidation process on the cat-
alyst surface involving generated CO2, such as reversible adsorp-
tion on the support. However, the responses of separately pulsed
CO2 (see SI, Fig. S4) over the catalyst did not show any signs of such
additional processes, conﬁrming that the evolution of the shoulder
is related to transient processes on the catalyst surface during CO2
formation. The surface transport, in this case, is clearly manifested
in time and is not obscured by other phenomena as it is in
atmospheric-ﬂow
TPO
experiments.
Theofanidis
et
al.
[75]
observed similar phenomena during isothermal (TAP) pulsed
oxidation of coke from Ni/Fe catalysts supported on MgAl2O4. In
addition to the shifting of the CO2 shoulder, they were able to dis-
tinguish the induction period of oxygen consumption without sig-
niﬁcant CO2 formation which they attributed to the oxidation of Ni
and Fe nanoparticles. In our case, no induction period was
observed indicating that the oxidizing species are surface-bound
rather than incorporated into an oxide.
It was previously shown that important kinetic features of car-
bon oxidation may be overlooked when using standard TPO analy-
sis, and it has been suggested that a combination of temperature-
resolved and time-resolved methods is beneﬁcial for coke charac-
terization [76,77]. Instead of a continuous temperature ramp until
all coke deposits are burned, a method of partial burning devel-
oped by Querini and Fung [76] involves a rapid initial ramp to an
intermediate value followed by prolonged burning of coke at a con-
stant temperature. These data provided additional information on
the morphology of coke by elucidating how the reaction order with
respect to coke changes as function of coke conversion. In their
experiments, the time-dependent CO2 generation during the
isothermal burn-off period also appears as a shoulder, but any
analogy with the shoulder in Fig. 8 is coincidental. Unlike the com-
bined procedure of incomplete ramping to an intermediate tem-
perature and isothermal burning applied by Querini and Fung,
we applied these two procedures separately as a partial TPO and
an isothermal pulsed oxidation. Combined, the results derived
from these experiments re-afﬁrm the complementarity of T- and
t-resolved
methods
for
oxidative
coke
characterization
and
demonstrate that chemical diversity is not necessary for carbon
deposits to exhibit complex oxidation behavior.
The second, radically different, mechanism that could explain
the pulsed oxidation results and coke differentiation upon oxida-
tion involves the migration of Pt nanoparticles over the support
surface. The migrating particles serve the role of moving sources
of dissociated oxygen species. Evidence of such a mechanism is
offered in the literature based on remarkable developments in
the Environmental TEM (ETEM) technology and its recent applica-
tions for in situ imaging during the carbon burn-off process on
transition metal nanoparticles. For example, Booth et al. [78] and
Gardini et al. [79] have demonstrated that metal nanoparticles
may engage in transport through the layers of carbon deposits dur-
ing carbon burn-off. This, in fact, elaborates on the much earlier
studies of Pt and other metals burning through graphite [80]. The
surface mobility of nanoparticles may provide an alternative expla-
nation for the time-dependent CO2 evolution that was observed
E.A. Redekop et al. / Journal of Catalysis 344 (2016) 482–495
493
during the TAP experiments, in agreement with Theofanidis et al.
[75], although the hypothetical surface mobility of Pt nanoparticles
is expected to be inhibited by strong stabilization provided by the
Mg(Al)Ox support [41]. Overall, the experimental results reported
here further substantiate the emerging view that catalytic pro-
cesses occurring under realistic conditions are highly-dynamic
processes involving multiple, often structure-altering, phenomena.
5. Conclusions
Coke deposition was characterized on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox dehy-
drogenation catalyst upon its exposure to C3H8 at 923 K in
atmospheric-pressure ﬂow experiments and low-pressure tran-
sient TAP experiments. In agreement with the literature, these
experiments suggest that non-selective Pt sites that are responsi-
ble for hydrogenolysis and decomposition of propane are partially
blocked during the initial stages of coke formation, leading to the
increase in selectivity toward propylene. Time-resolved TAP exper-
iments with a variable time delay between successive sequences of
C3H8 pulses revealed that the most active non-selective Pt sites
deactivated by C3H8 are spontaneously uncovered in vacuum
within minutes. DFT calculations support the assignment of these
observations to a combination of (i) C3-to-C1 conversion followed
by the migration of coke precursors from dehydrogenation sites
toward the sites of graphene assembly and (ii) restructuring of Pt
nanoparticles under the inﬂuence of carbon deposits, which leads
to the formation of new Pt sites. It can be surmised that TAP or
TAP-inspired methodologies can offer promising tools for tracking
the migration of carbon precursors on a substrate and their assim-
ilation into growing carbon deposits in the context of CVD gra-
phene growth.
According to TEM, the morphology of mature carbonaceous
deposits obtained in atmospheric-pressure ﬂow experiments cor-
responds to extended graphene sheets which originate on small
(1.5–2 nm) Pt nanoparticles and continuously shift onto the sup-
port. On the support surface, thin graphene sheets undergo severe
deformations and form disordered layers and entangled spaghetti-
like bundles, possibly also containing carbon nanotubes. Graphene
formed on larger (5–10 nm) Pt nanoparticles does not shift onto
the support, but forms encapsulating graphitic layers, also in
agreement with Peng et al. [27]. Most of the coke deposits blocking
the active sites on small nanoparticles can be removed and a signif-
icant portion of the initial catalytic activity can be restored by par-
tial oxidation at relatively mild conditions (up to 700 K), without
burning off all of the carbon deposits from larger particles and
support.
Carbon deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homo-
geneous and consist primarily of graphene, yet their oxidation is a
complicated process involving both chemical reactions and trans-
port processes on the support surface. The involvement of surface
transport can explain the presence of two CO2 peaks that are often
observed during TPO experiments with coked metal catalysts. In
fact, both of those peaks may contain the coke located on the sup-
port material, but some of these coke deposits may be more acces-
sible for the oxidizing species due to additional transport processes
on the surface. These TPO peaks should not be prematurely assigned
to distinct forms or location of carbon without additional consider-
ations involving complex transport-chemistry interactions. Time-
resolved isothermal oxidation should be used in conjunction with
temperature-resolved
oxidation
in
order
to
elucidate
such
interactions. Based on limited data, we could not unambiguously
distinguish between the surface mobility of activated oxygen spe-
cies or Pt nanoparticles as sources of the observed behavior.
The conclusions of this study exemplify how time-resolved
kinetic characterization using small perturbations (e.g. TAP) can
offer a sensitive probe for the subtle details of catalytic reactions,
CVD, ALD, solid-phase transitions, and other surface-mediated pro-
cesses. Similar experiments with time-delay can be made even
more powerful by using isotopic labeling of gases and by coupling
pulse-response techniques with simultaneous surface-sensitive
spectroscopy.
