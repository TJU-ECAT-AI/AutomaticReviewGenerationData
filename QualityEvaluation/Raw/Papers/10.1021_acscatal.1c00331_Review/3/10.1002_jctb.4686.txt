The synthesis of new coke-resistant support and its application in propane dehydrogenation to propene
Abstract
BACKGROUND
ZSM-5 zeolite has been used as a common support for PtSn-based catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. But owing to its high acidy, coke accommodation and stability of the catalyst are not satisfactory. Here, in order to improve the performance, the new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 (abbreviated henceforth as ZQ) has been synthesized.
RESULTS
By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted. These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke. Moreover, the coke deposit on PtSnNa/ZQ migrated from active metal to the support. As expected, by using the catalyst PtSnNa/ZQ, the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation to propene and the stability of the catalyst were significantly promoted.
CONCLUSIONS
The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enabled better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry
INTRODUCTION
Propene is an important chemical raw material and has gained increased attention in chemical processing. It has wide applications in the production of polypropene, polyacrylontrile, acrolein, glycerine, isopropanol, and other chemicals.1-3 Yet dehydrogenation of propane is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction that requires relatively high temperature and low pressure to achieve high yield of propene.4, 5 Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is inevitable because of the rigorous reaction conditions. Despite numerous attempts at modification of Pt-catalysts, the problem of deactivation due to coking still persists.6-10 It is therefore necessary to develop an improved catalyst with better activity, stability, and selectivity.
In recent years supported bimetallic PtSn-based catalysts have been considered suitable for propane dehydrogenation reaction. Many researchers investigated the effects of these catalysts on the performance of this reaction. The addition of a third metal additive (such as alkali-metal, alkaline-earth metal and/or rare-earth metal) in these bimetallic catalysts was considered to be an effective way to promote the catalytic activity, selectivity and the lifetime of these catalysts.11-14 Adjusting reaction conditions and preparation methods can improve the activity of such bimetallic catalysts.15-18 Recently, modification of the physiochemical properties of the support has attracted much attention for the improvement of PtSn-based catalysts.19, 20 Many kinds of material have been used as catalyst support in propane dehydrogenation to propene. Zhang et al.21 compared different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) for PtSn-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. They found that a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution of the support were favorable for the dispersion of metallic particles. With supports having a wide pore size distribution, coke could more easily cover the external surface of the support instead of the metallic surface. Based on the findings of Zhang's group, we aim to obtain a suitable material for the application of propane dehydrogenation reaction which possesses these excellent properties.
ZSM-5 zeolite has been used as an efficient support for PtSn-based catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Due to its large surface area coupled with the right channel properties, catalysts supported on ZSM-5 possess an enhanced capacity to accommodate coke.22 However, pure ZSM-5 zeolite has a large amount of acid content and almost half of the acidity is centered in the strong acid sites, which is of advantage for the formation of coke during the reaction of dehydrogenation.21 Moreover, for PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts, it is well known that the platinum particles are too large to enter the zeolite channels, so that most of the Pt particles are located on the external surface of the zeolite. Thus, during the reaction, coke can easily become deposited on Pt particles, leading to rapid catalytic deactivation. In order to resolve these coke problems, Lu's group23 developed a coking- and sintering-resistant palladium catalyst using an atomic layer deposition method. They found that alumina overcoating on supported Pd catalysts can effectively inhibit coke formation and greatly improve the thermal stability of Pd at temperatures in excess of its Tammann temperature.
In our present work, instead of using atomic layer deposition, hierarchical-pores are directly introduced into ZSM-5 zeolite. This new zeolite was used as a support for PtSnNa-based catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2-physisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Forier transfom infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), IR spectrum of adsorbed pyridine, H2-TPD, and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to observe the physicochemical characteristics of each sample. PtSnNa/ZSM-5 was used as a reference catalyst. The catalytic performance was evaluated in a micro-reactor and the coke deposits of each catalyst were characterized by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
EXPERIMENTS
Material preparation
ZSM-5 zeolite was hydrothermally synthesized using the reagents silica sol, sodium meta-aluminate, NaOH, hexanediamine and deionized water. The molar composition of the precursor gel was (60–100)SiO2: (0.15–0.3)Al2O3: 3.5NaOH: 1400H2O: (10–20)NH2-(CH2)6NH2. First, the gel was stirred at 100°C for 3 h. Then, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 160°C for 24 h. The as-synthesized zeolite was calcined at 550°C in air for 8 h to decompose the organic template, followed by NH4+-exchange with 1 mol L−1 NH4Cl solution three times. The proton form of ZSM-5 was obtained by calcining the ammonium form of ZSM-5 at 550°C for 8 h.
ZQ was synthesized by adding dimethyldiallyl ammonium acrylamide (PDD-AM) into the gel, which was the same as the precursor gel of ZSM-5. The molar composition was (60–100)SiO2: (0.15–0.3)Al2O3: 3.5NaOH: 1400H2O: (10–20)NH2-(CH2)6NH2: (5–30)PDD-AM. After stirring intensively, the mixture gel was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and stirred at 160°C for 1 day until crystallization was complete. After crystallization, the product was filtered, washed with deionized water, dried at 80°C, and calcined at 550°C.
Catalyst preparation
PtSnNa/ZSM-5 and PtSnNa/ZQ catalysts were prepared by a sequential impregnation method. The nominal compositions of each sample were 0.5 wt% for Pt, 1.0 wt% for Sn, and 1.0 wt% for Na, respectively. The prepared catalyst was dried at 80°C for 3 h. Then, the prepared samples were pelletized and crushed to 12–18 mesh size. After complete drying, the catalysts were calcined at 500°C for 5 h, and finally reduced under H2 at 500°C for 8 h.
Catalysts characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of different samples were obtained on a Bruker D-8 X-ray powder diffractometer coupled to a copper anode tube. The Kα radiation was selected with a diffracted beam monochromator. An angular range of 2θ from 5° to 60° was recorded using step scanning and long counting times to determine the position of the peaks.
The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at −196°C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus. Before measurements, the samples were degassed under 300°C and 1 × 10−3 Torr. The pore size distribution curve was obtained by analysis of the desorption branch of the isotherm. The specific surface area was obtained using the BET method. The micropore volume, mesopore volume, and external surface area were calculated using the t-plot method. The pore size was reported as the average pore diameter.
Surface acidity was measured by NH3-TPD in a Micromeritics ASAP 2750 apparatus. The sample (0.15 g) was preheated at 500°C for 1 h, and then cooled to room temperature in flowing He. At this temperature, sufficient pulses of NH3 were injected until adsorption saturation was achieved. TPD was carried out from 100°C to 550°C with a heating rate of 10°C min−1 and with helium (30 mL min−1) as the carrier gas.
Infrared spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectroscope using the DRIFT technique, scanning from 400 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1. The sample was ground with KBr and pressed into a thin wafer.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded using a Nicolet-510P apparatus. The samples were pressed into thin wafers and placed in a Pyrex glass cell equipped with CaF2 windows. The samples were pretreated in situ at 300°C for 1 h under vacuum (10−6 Torr) and then cooled to room temperature. Afterward, pyridine was passed over the sample for 30 min and the pyridine adsorption spectra were recorded after desorption at 150°C for 1 h.
Hydrogen TPD of different samples was performed on the same apparatus as described for NH3-TPD. The catalyst (0.15 g) was pre-reduced in flowing H2 at 500°C for 1 h. When cooled to room temperature, desorptions were programmed up to 650°C with a heating rate of 10°C min−1 in flowing N2.
XPS measurements were carried out on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 spectroscope (USA) using nonmonochromatic Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) radiation. The pressure of the analysis chamber was kept at 4 × 10−10 Torr. All samples were previously reduced in situ under hydrogen at 500°C for 1 h. Binding energies were referred to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The peak areas were estimated by fitting the experimental results with Lorentzian–Gaussian curves.
Coke was analyzed by thermogravimetric (TG) test and a temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) experiment. Thermogravimetric analysis was measured in airflow (30 mL min−1) with a LCT thermogravimetric analyzer (Beijing optical instrument factory, PR China) from room temperature to 700°C at a rate of 2°C min−1. 0.02 g of the catalyst was set in the analyzer. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was measured with the same apparatus as for NH3-TPD and H2-TPD. About 0.05 g of sample was placed in a quartz reactor at room temperature, then heated up to 700°C at a rate of 10°C min−1 in a 5% O2/He mixture (30 mL min−1).
Catalytic evaluation
Propane dehydrogenation was carried out in a conventional quartz tubular micro-reactor. The catalyst (mass 1.5 g) was placed at the center of the reactor. Reaction conditions were as follows: 590°C reaction temperature, 0.1 MPa pressure, H2/C3H8 = 0.25 (molar ratio) and the propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was 3.0 h−1. The reaction products were analyzed with an online GC-14C gas chromatogram equipped with an activated alumina packed column and a flame ionization detector (FID). The conversion of propane is defined as the percentage of propane converted to all the different products. The selectivity to propene is defined as the amount of propene obtained divided by the amount of reactant converted to all products.
A schematic diagram of the catalyst loaded in the reactor is shown in Fig. 1. The length and diameter of the reactor tube were 200 and 28 mm, respectively. The location of the loaded catalyst was in the middle of the reactor, and the height of the catalytic bed was about 20 mm. This configuration was used to ensure that no temperature differences existed inside the catalytic bed.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
X-ray diffraction patterns of different samples are shown in Fig. 1. Basically, the XRD pattern of ZSM-5 has representative peaks at 8–9° and 22–24°, corresponding to those for pure ZSM-5.24 In comparison, after adding PDD-AM, the pattern of ZQ in Fig. 2 was found to be similar to that of ZSM-5 zeolite, suggesting that the structure of ZQ is not destroyed after modification. Besides, it is worthy noting that the intensity of these peaks is strengthened in ZQ, indicating that the crystallinity of ZQ material was promoted.

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution of different samples are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3(a), the parent HZSM-5 zeolite shows a I-type isotherm with a small N2 uptake at higher relative pressure, typical for a material microstructure without any mesopores.25 In contrast, the ZQ sample exhibits a type IV adsorption–desorption isotherm with a H1 hysteresis loop,26 which is usually associated with the filling and emptying of mesopores by capillary condensation.27 This phenomenon implies a pore size distribution in ZQ different from that of ZSM-5. As observed in Fig. 3(b), for the pore size distribution in ZQ, there is a main distribution peak centered at 3 nm, and a small shoulder obtained in the region of 20–80 nm. There are thus two kinds of ‘hierarchical-pores’ appearing in the ZQ sample. The smaller ones are intracrystalline mesopores inside the crystals,28 accounting for the main part of the pore distribution in ZQ; while the other large pores are mesopores or even macropores appearing on the surface of ZQ. From the textural properties given in Table 1, calculated from the nitrogen desorption isotherms, the average pore diameter of ZQ is 3.9 nm after treatment with PDD-AM. But unfortunately, the appearance of these ‘hierarchical-pores’ leads to a decrease in surface area of ZQ.29 However, in Table 1, although the surface area of ZQ is decreased to 304 m2 g−1 compared with that of ZSM-5, the external surface area (Sext) of ZQ (120 m2 g−1) is strongly increased. The total pore volumn (Vtotal) of ZQ (0.22 cm3 g) is also significantly increased. These changes can be attributed to the introduction of the two kinds of ‘hierarchical-pores’ in ZQ zeolite. Also, according to results found by Gao's group,30 catalyst supports with large pore size distribution were found to be more effective in overcoming diffusion and mass transfer limitations. Thus ZQ supported catalyst ought to show better resistance to coking during the reaction.

Figure 4 shows TEM images of the different samples. In Fig. 4(1), it is not difficult to see that the as-synthesized particles are finally transformed into ZSM-5 crystals through a zeolitization process. This is in agreement with the findings of the Grieken group.31 Moreover, considering the microstructure of ZSM-5, the surface of the crystal is so smooth that the pore structure can hardly be seen in Fig. 4(1). In comparison, as shown in Fig. 4(2), hierarchical-pores are visible and the shape of the crystal is different from that of ZSM-5. Because of these changes in structure, the particle size of platinum on the surface of each catalyst is different. Compared with the catalyst PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (Fig. 4(3)), the particle size of platinum in PtSnNa/ZQ is larger. According to the particle size distribution of platinum, the average particle size increased from 12.8 nm in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 to 32.4 nm in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. However, in Fig. 4(4), after impregnation, it is interesting to observe that the visible hierarchical-pores in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst have disappeared. Moreover, the particle size of platinum in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst is well matched with the pore size of these pores. These results suggest that these hierarchical-pores are filled with the nanoparticles of platinum and other metals in PtSnNa/ZQ. Compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, owing to the restriction of these hierarchical-pores in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst, the further agglomeration of platinum particles is inhibited during the reaction, which is advantage to the stability of the catalyst.

For further analysis of the physicochemical properties of zeolite, FT-IR spectra of different samples were taken and the results in the region 400–4000 cm−1 are shown in Fig. 5. The presence of absorption bands around 450 and 545 cm−1 are characteristic of the ZSM-5 crystalline structure and the ratio of the intensities of these two peaks provides an approximate estimate of the degree of crystallinity of a given zeolite sample.32 In the ZQ spectra, the increases in intensity of the spectral bands are indicative of augmented crystallinity. Results from XRD further validate this point. The peak in the region of 900–1300 cm−1 is assigned to asymmetrical T-O-T stretching,33 and in the region of 3000–3750 cm−1 to OH-stretching. Besides, bridging structural hydroxyl groups of the Si(OH)Al type, which determine the Brönsted acidity of the material, are known to give IR absorption at around 3600 cm−1.34, 35 Consequently, as shown in Fig. 5, an increased intensity in the region of 3000–3750 cm−1 in the IR adsorption spectrum of ZQ suggests that its acidity is different from that of the ZSM-5 zeolite.

Based on the results of FT-IR, in order to characterize the acid strength and amount of acid sites on the surface of the support, NH3-TPD patterns of different samples are shown in Fig. 6(a), and also the NH3 uptakes of different samples are summarized in Table 2. In ZSM-5, there are two desorption peaks observed at low temperature (Peak I, 235°C) and high temperature (Peak II, 416°C), which correspond to weak and strong acid sites, respectively. In comparison, the amount of acid sites in ZQ is decreased significantly in Fig. 6(a), especially for the strong acid sites. According to the above findings, and due to the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ material, these results might be attributed to the effective framework of Al atoms.36 The corresponding temperatures of both strong and weak acid sites of ZQ shift towards lower temperature compared with ZSM-5. Hence, the strength of acid sites in ZQ becomes weaker. Moreover, it is interesting to observe that new ammonia desorption appeared in ZQ at around 292°C (Peak III). This newly-found peak implies the emergence of some acid sites with moderate intensity, which could be attributed to the change in the state of Al species in the framework of ZQ. Similar results were found in previous work.37

Pyridine adsorption IR spectroscopy is another powerful technique for measuring and distinguishing acidic sites in samples. The pyridine adsorption by different samples is shown in Fig. 6(b). For both samples, it is clearly found that three pyridine absorption bands occur at 1448, 1490 and 1548 cm−1. The pyridine absorption bands at 1448 cm−1 and 1548 cm−1 are assigned to the absorption of pyridine on Lewis acid sites and Brönsted acid sites, respectively; the band at 1490 cm−1 is assigned to the absorption on both acid sites.4, 38 For the ZQ sample, compared with ZSM-5, the intensity of Brönsted acid sites becomes much smaller, while the intensity of Lewis acid sites is slightly increased. According to the results of FT-IR, this could be attributed to the change in the state of framework Al species in the ZQ sample. Combined with the NH3-TPD results, the weakened acidity of support will help to convert Brönsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and lead to a reduced coke formation rate during the reaction.39
For Pt-based catalyst, it is well known that two kinds of active Pt species exist on the external surface of the catalyst.40 One dominates the low temperature H2 adsorption, while another can absorb more H2 at high temperature. H2-TPD profiles under different conditions can be obtained by changing the hydrogen adsorption temperature. When the hydrogen adsorption is carried out from 600°C to room temperature, both active Pt sites can absorb hydrogen so that complete H2-TPD profiles can be obtained. As shown in Fig. 7, there are two main desorption peaks at low temperature and high temperature for different catalysts. In both catalysts it is worth noting that there is no obvious change in the hydrogen desorption peak at low temperature, which indicates that the active center of Pt is almost the same in the two catalysts. However, compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, the hydrogen desorption at high temperature is strongly increased in PtSnNa/ZQ. Generally speaking, this hydrogen desorption peak at high temperature is usually thought to be spillover hydrogen, and the M/A (M: the metallic active sites; A: the accepter of spillover hydrogen) interface is the most important one to influence this.41 In this circumstance, hydrogen can be dissociated to H atoms at the surface of Pt active sites and they may overflow to the surface of adjacent Pt oxides or the other Pt oxides that interact strongly with the carrier. In this way, the spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and the active sites of the catalyst can be stabilized in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction.

For different catalysts, in order to investigate the interactions between metal particles and supports after modification, the chemical state of catalyst components at the catalyst surface after reduction was tested by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Figure 8 shows the XPS spectra corresponding to the Sn 3d5/2 level of different catalysts after reduction at 500°C and the binding energies of Pt 4d5/2, Si 2p, Al 2p, Sn 3d5/2 are summarized in Table 3. In Fig. 8, by deconvolution of the spectrum of PtSnNa/ZSM-5, three peaks were obtained at 485.2, 486.5, 487.4 eV, assigned to different tin species. The component at lower binding energy is attributed to metallic state Sn (Sn0), while the others are ascribed to different types of oxides of tin (SnO and/or SnO2).42, 43 For tin, because their binding energies are very close, it is difficult to distinguish between Sn4+ and Sn2+ in XPS.44 As observed in Table 3, the percentage of Sn0 for PtSnNa/ZQ is 25.8%, which is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (29.1%). Generally, when Sn is in the zero state, Sn species could be alloyed with platinum to produce Pt-Sn alloy. In this case, it can result in metal Pt poisoning and the catalysts deactivating.45 Correspondingly more tin in a nonmetallic state (Sn4+ or Sn2+) was found in PtSnNa/ZQ (Table 3). This indicates that the structure modification of ZQ establishes strong interactions between tin species and the support, resulting in a significant amount of Sn species existing in an oxidized state and thus facilitating the Pt–Sn interaction.

The catalytic behaviors of different catalysts are depicted in Fig. 9 and the data listed in Table 4. It can be seen that hierarchical-pores in PtSnNa/ZQ have significant impacts on the catalytic conversion and its selectivity. The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5. To explain this finding, it should be noted that the PtSnNa catalyst are bifunctional and the two active centers (the metal particles and the acid sites) might work collaboratively: dehydrogenation and ring opening might occur on the metal particles, whereas isomerization through carbonium-ion intermediates could occurs on the acid sites.46 As expected, more Sn exists in oxidized form (XPS results), which is favorable for the anchoring of Pt to Sn oxide. The Pt sites anchoring Sn oxide surface with ‘sandwich structure’ are the main reaction active sites of Pt-catalysts.40 In this case, more stabilized active sites for the catalyst, advantageous to the dehydrogenation of propane, are obtained. Reflected in Fig. 9(a), the equilibrium propane conversion of PtSnNa/ZQ is much higher than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5. Also, from the results of NH3-TPD, higher acid sites were obtained in ZSM-5 which generally promote the subsequent cracking reaction of the initially form C3+ carbenium ions.47 The dehydrogenation of propane is assumed to proceed through carbonium-ion intermediates.48 So the higher acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite is the main factor responsible for the lower selectivity to propene of PtSnNa/ZSM-5. In combination with the results in Table 4, the deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ (12.8%) is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (17.4%). These results demonstrate that PtSnNa/ZQ would be a better dehydrogenation catalyst, having higher propane conversion and catalytic stability.

To analyze the coke deposits on different catalysts, the TPO profiles of different catalysts were measured and are shown in Fig. 10. In the TPO profiles, two successive peaks representing different carbon deposits on the surface of catalysts are displayed. The carbon deposits corresponding to the first peak (at low temperature) cover the active center, while the second peak (at high temperature) represents one that is located on the external surface of the support.49 From Fig. 10, it can easily be seen that the total amount of coke deposits on PtSnNa/ZQ is much less than that on PtSnNa/ZSM-5, especially for the coke deposits on the external surface of the support. In order to confirm this result with great certainty, the peak areas of different coke deposits of catalysts are added. Table 5 lists the peak areas corresponding to the different coke deposits of catalysts, and coke quantitative analysis by the TGA method has also been carried out. In Table 5, it can be seen that the total amount of coke deposits drops significantly from PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (6.2%) to PtSnNa/ZQ (3.1%). The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke. In addition, the presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal.50, 51 Thus, significant amounts of Sn oxides in the catalyst will promote the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support. Besides, the weakened acidity of the support will help to convert Brönsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and lead to a reduced coke formation rate during the reaction.39 Based on the above results (NH3-TPD and XPS analysis), the coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites.52 As reflected in Table 5, compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the peak area of low temperature in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst is increased, while the area of high temperature is reduced significantly. This indicates that, on PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst, the coke precursor formed on the metal was highly suppressed and even migrated to the external surface of the support.

Based on the results obtained above, a model for the coke deposition on different catalysts is proposed (Fig. 11). As is known, there are two kinds of ‘hierarchical-pores’ existing in the PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. On the one hand, for the intracrystalline mesopores, the average pore size is far less than the particle size of platinum and the Pt particles cannot enter these pores in the catalyst. However, according to the results of Yue' group,53, 54 due to the better transport of the reactant and product molecules, the introduction of these intracrystalline mesopores in ZSM-5 improves the catalytic activity as well as the stability of the catalyst. On the other hand, for the large pores on the surface of the catalyst, these pores are large enough to anchor the platinum particles inside. Therefore, on PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, all of the metal particles are dispersed on the external surface of support, while the particles of platinum could be located in the hierarchical-pores of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. Moreover, in this case, more Sn species existed in oxide states, which facilitate the anchoring of Pt particles on the catalysts. According to these effects, further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process is inhibited, leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. Moreover, by the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly. Therefore, during the reaction, the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbon–metal bonds, the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support.55 In these circumstances, carbon deposits on the active metal are reduced during the reaction of propane dehydrogenation. Consequently, this implies that PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke.

CONCLUSIONS
In this work, the effects of the modification of ZSM-5 zeolite on catalytic structure and the reaction performance of PtSnNa-based catalysts were investigated. The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ not only modified the textual properties but also influenced the acid content of zeolite. XPS results indicate that more oxides of Sn could be anchored on the surface of ZQ zeolite. Moreover, the weakened acid sites and existence of oxide Sn in ZQ suppressed the coke precursor forming on the metal and even facilitated migration of the coke precursor to the external surface of the support. From TPO analysis, the carbon deposits on the metallic surface of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst were strongly decreased, implying that Pt particles which located in the hierarchical-pores could avoid the rapid cover by carbon deposits. Based on these results, in comparison with traditional ZSM-5 zeolite, PtSnNa/ZQ possessed better propane conversion and greater stability of the catalyst. Further research should investigate the control of pore size distribution of the hierarchical-pores in zeolite.

INTRODUCTION
Propene is an important chemical raw material and has gained increased attention in chemical processing. It has wide applications in the production of polypropene, polyacrylontrile, acrolein, glycerine, isopropanol, and other chemicals.1-3 Yet dehydrogenation of propane is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction that requires relatively high temperature and low pressure to achieve high yield of propene.4, 5 Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is inevitable because of the rigorous reaction conditions. Despite numerous attempts at modification of Pt-catalysts, the problem of deactivation due to coking still persists.6-10 It is therefore necessary to develop an improved catalyst with better activity, stability, and selectivity.
In recent years supported bimetallic PtSn-based catalysts have been considered suitable for propane dehydrogenation reaction. Many researchers investigated the effects of these catalysts on the performance of this reaction. The addition of a third metal additive (such as alkali-metal, alkaline-earth metal and/or rare-earth metal) in these bimetallic catalysts was considered to be an effective way to promote the catalytic activity, selectivity and the lifetime of these catalysts.11-14 Adjusting reaction conditions and preparation methods can improve the activity of such bimetallic catalysts.15-18 Recently, modification of the physiochemical properties of the support has attracted much attention for the improvement of PtSn-based catalysts.19, 20 Many kinds of material have been used as catalyst support in propane dehydrogenation to propene. Zhang et al.21 compared different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) for PtSn-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. They found that a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution of the support were favorable for the dispersion of metallic particles. With supports having a wide pore size distribution, coke could more easily cover the external surface of the support instead of the metallic surface. Based on the findings of Zhang's group, we aim to obtain a suitable material for the application of propane dehydrogenation reaction which possesses these excellent properties.
ZSM-5 zeolite has been used as an efficient support for PtSn-based catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Due to its large surface area coupled with the right channel properties, catalysts supported on ZSM-5 possess an enhanced capacity to accommodate coke.22 However, pure ZSM-5 zeolite has a large amount of acid content and almost half of the acidity is centered in the strong acid sites, which is of advantage for the formation of coke during the reaction of dehydrogenation.21 Moreover, for PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts, it is well known that the platinum particles are too large to enter the zeolite channels, so that most of the Pt particles are located on the external surface of the zeolite. Thus, during the reaction, coke can easily become deposited on Pt particles, leading to rapid catalytic deactivation. In order to resolve these coke problems, Lu's group23 developed a coking- and sintering-resistant palladium catalyst using an atomic layer deposition method. They found that alumina overcoating on supported Pd catalysts can effectively inhibit coke formation and greatly improve the thermal stability of Pd at temperatures in excess of its Tammann temperature.
In our present work, instead of using atomic layer deposition, hierarchical-pores are directly introduced into ZSM-5 zeolite. This new zeolite was used as a support for PtSnNa-based catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2-physisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Forier transfom infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), IR spectrum of adsorbed pyridine, H2-TPD, and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to observe the physicochemical characteristics of each sample. PtSnNa/ZSM-5 was used as a reference catalyst. The catalytic performance was evaluated in a micro-reactor and the coke deposits of each catalyst were characterized by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
EXPERIMENTS
Material preparation
ZSM-5 zeolite was hydrothermally synthesized using the reagents silica sol, sodium meta-aluminate, NaOH, hexanediamine and deionized water. The molar composition of the precursor gel was (60–100)SiO2: (0.15–0.3)Al2O3: 3.5NaOH: 1400H2O: (10–20)NH2-(CH2)6NH2. First, the gel was stirred at 100°C for 3 h. Then, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 160°C for 24 h. The as-synthesized zeolite was calcined at 550°C in air for 8 h to decompose the organic template, followed by NH4+-exchange with 1 mol L−1 NH4Cl solution three times. The proton form of ZSM-5 was obtained by calcining the ammonium form of ZSM-5 at 550°C for 8 h.
ZQ was synthesized by adding dimethyldiallyl ammonium acrylamide (PDD-AM) into the gel, which was the same as the precursor gel of ZSM-5. The molar composition was (60–100)SiO2: (0.15–0.3)Al2O3: 3.5NaOH: 1400H2O: (10–20)NH2-(CH2)6NH2: (5–30)PDD-AM. After stirring intensively, the mixture gel was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and stirred at 160°C for 1 day until crystallization was complete. After crystallization, the product was filtered, washed with deionized water, dried at 80°C, and calcined at 550°C.
Catalyst preparation
PtSnNa/ZSM-5 and PtSnNa/ZQ catalysts were prepared by a sequential impregnation method. The nominal compositions of each sample were 0.5 wt% for Pt, 1.0 wt% for Sn, and 1.0 wt% for Na, respectively. The prepared catalyst was dried at 80°C for 3 h. Then, the prepared samples were pelletized and crushed to 12–18 mesh size. After complete drying, the catalysts were calcined at 500°C for 5 h, and finally reduced under H2 at 500°C for 8 h.
Catalysts characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of different samples were obtained on a Bruker D-8 X-ray powder diffractometer coupled to a copper anode tube. The Kα radiation was selected with a diffracted beam monochromator. An angular range of 2θ from 5° to 60° was recorded using step scanning and long counting times to determine the position of the peaks.
The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at −196°C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus. Before measurements, the samples were degassed under 300°C and 1 × 10−3 Torr. The pore size distribution curve was obtained by analysis of the desorption branch of the isotherm. The specific surface area was obtained using the BET method. The micropore volume, mesopore volume, and external surface area were calculated using the t-plot method. The pore size was reported as the average pore diameter.
Surface acidity was measured by NH3-TPD in a Micromeritics ASAP 2750 apparatus. The sample (0.15 g) was preheated at 500°C for 1 h, and then cooled to room temperature in flowing He. At this temperature, sufficient pulses of NH3 were injected until adsorption saturation was achieved. TPD was carried out from 100°C to 550°C with a heating rate of 10°C min−1 and with helium (30 mL min−1) as the carrier gas.
Infrared spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectroscope using the DRIFT technique, scanning from 400 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1. The sample was ground with KBr and pressed into a thin wafer.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded using a Nicolet-510P apparatus. The samples were pressed into thin wafers and placed in a Pyrex glass cell equipped with CaF2 windows. The samples were pretreated in situ at 300°C for 1 h under vacuum (10−6 Torr) and then cooled to room temperature. Afterward, pyridine was passed over the sample for 30 min and the pyridine adsorption spectra were recorded after desorption at 150°C for 1 h.
Hydrogen TPD of different samples was performed on the same apparatus as described for NH3-TPD. The catalyst (0.15 g) was pre-reduced in flowing H2 at 500°C for 1 h. When cooled to room temperature, desorptions were programmed up to 650°C with a heating rate of 10°C min−1 in flowing N2.
XPS measurements were carried out on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 spectroscope (USA) using nonmonochromatic Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) radiation. The pressure of the analysis chamber was kept at 4 × 10−10 Torr. All samples were previously reduced in situ under hydrogen at 500°C for 1 h. Binding energies were referred to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The peak areas were estimated by fitting the experimental results with Lorentzian–Gaussian curves.
Coke was analyzed by thermogravimetric (TG) test and a temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) experiment. Thermogravimetric analysis was measured in airflow (30 mL min−1) with a LCT thermogravimetric analyzer (Beijing optical instrument factory, PR China) from room temperature to 700°C at a rate of 2°C min−1. 0.02 g of the catalyst was set in the analyzer. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was measured with the same apparatus as for NH3-TPD and H2-TPD. About 0.05 g of sample was placed in a quartz reactor at room temperature, then heated up to 700°C at a rate of 10°C min−1 in a 5% O2/He mixture (30 mL min−1).
Catalytic evaluation
Propane dehydrogenation was carried out in a conventional quartz tubular micro-reactor. The catalyst (mass 1.5 g) was placed at the center of the reactor. Reaction conditions were as follows: 590°C reaction temperature, 0.1 MPa pressure, H2/C3H8 = 0.25 (molar ratio) and the propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was 3.0 h−1. The reaction products were analyzed with an online GC-14C gas chromatogram equipped with an activated alumina packed column and a flame ionization detector (FID). The conversion of propane is defined as the percentage of propane converted to all the different products. The selectivity to propene is defined as the amount of propene obtained divided by the amount of reactant converted to all products.
A schematic diagram of the catalyst loaded in the reactor is shown in Fig. 1. The length and diameter of the reactor tube were 200 and 28 mm, respectively. The location of the loaded catalyst was in the middle of the reactor, and the height of the catalytic bed was about 20 mm. This configuration was used to ensure that no temperature differences existed inside the catalytic bed.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
X-ray diffraction patterns of different samples are shown in Fig. 1. Basically, the XRD pattern of ZSM-5 has representative peaks at 8–9° and 22–24°, corresponding to those for pure ZSM-5.24 In comparison, after adding PDD-AM, the pattern of ZQ in Fig. 2 was found to be similar to that of ZSM-5 zeolite, suggesting that the structure of ZQ is not destroyed after modification. Besides, it is worthy noting that the intensity of these peaks is strengthened in ZQ, indicating that the crystallinity of ZQ material was promoted.

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution of different samples are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3(a), the parent HZSM-5 zeolite shows a I-type isotherm with a small N2 uptake at higher relative pressure, typical for a material microstructure without any mesopores.25 In contrast, the ZQ sample exhibits a type IV adsorption–desorption isotherm with a H1 hysteresis loop,26 which is usually associated with the filling and emptying of mesopores by capillary condensation.27 This phenomenon implies a pore size distribution in ZQ different from that of ZSM-5. As observed in Fig. 3(b), for the pore size distribution in ZQ, there is a main distribution peak centered at 3 nm, and a small shoulder obtained in the region of 20–80 nm. There are thus two kinds of ‘hierarchical-pores’ appearing in the ZQ sample. The smaller ones are intracrystalline mesopores inside the crystals,28 accounting for the main part of the pore distribution in ZQ; while the other large pores are mesopores or even macropores appearing on the surface of ZQ. From the textural properties given in Table 1, calculated from the nitrogen desorption isotherms, the average pore diameter of ZQ is 3.9 nm after treatment with PDD-AM. But unfortunately, the appearance of these ‘hierarchical-pores’ leads to a decrease in surface area of ZQ.29 However, in Table 1, although the surface area of ZQ is decreased to 304 m2 g−1 compared with that of ZSM-5, the external surface area (Sext) of ZQ (120 m2 g−1) is strongly increased. The total pore volumn (Vtotal) of ZQ (0.22 cm3 g) is also significantly increased. These changes can be attributed to the introduction of the two kinds of ‘hierarchical-pores’ in ZQ zeolite. Also, according to results found by Gao's group,30 catalyst supports with large pore size distribution were found to be more effective in overcoming diffusion and mass transfer limitations. Thus ZQ supported catalyst ought to show better resistance to coking during the reaction.

Figure 4 shows TEM images of the different samples. In Fig. 4(1), it is not difficult to see that the as-synthesized particles are finally transformed into ZSM-5 crystals through a zeolitization process. This is in agreement with the findings of the Grieken group.31 Moreover, considering the microstructure of ZSM-5, the surface of the crystal is so smooth that the pore structure can hardly be seen in Fig. 4(1). In comparison, as shown in Fig. 4(2), hierarchical-pores are visible and the shape of the crystal is different from that of ZSM-5. Because of these changes in structure, the particle size of platinum on the surface of each catalyst is different. Compared with the catalyst PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (Fig. 4(3)), the particle size of platinum in PtSnNa/ZQ is larger. According to the particle size distribution of platinum, the average particle size increased from 12.8 nm in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 to 32.4 nm in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. However, in Fig. 4(4), after impregnation, it is interesting to observe that the visible hierarchical-pores in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst have disappeared. Moreover, the particle size of platinum in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst is well matched with the pore size of these pores. These results suggest that these hierarchical-pores are filled with the nanoparticles of platinum and other metals in PtSnNa/ZQ. Compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, owing to the restriction of these hierarchical-pores in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst, the further agglomeration of platinum particles is inhibited during the reaction, which is advantage to the stability of the catalyst.

For further analysis of the physicochemical properties of zeolite, FT-IR spectra of different samples were taken and the results in the region 400–4000 cm−1 are shown in Fig. 5. The presence of absorption bands around 450 and 545 cm−1 are characteristic of the ZSM-5 crystalline structure and the ratio of the intensities of these two peaks provides an approximate estimate of the degree of crystallinity of a given zeolite sample.32 In the ZQ spectra, the increases in intensity of the spectral bands are indicative of augmented crystallinity. Results from XRD further validate this point. The peak in the region of 900–1300 cm−1 is assigned to asymmetrical T-O-T stretching,33 and in the region of 3000–3750 cm−1 to OH-stretching. Besides, bridging structural hydroxyl groups of the Si(OH)Al type, which determine the Brönsted acidity of the material, are known to give IR absorption at around 3600 cm−1.34, 35 Consequently, as shown in Fig. 5, an increased intensity in the region of 3000–3750 cm−1 in the IR adsorption spectrum of ZQ suggests that its acidity is different from that of the ZSM-5 zeolite.

Based on the results of FT-IR, in order to characterize the acid strength and amount of acid sites on the surface of the support, NH3-TPD patterns of different samples are shown in Fig. 6(a), and also the NH3 uptakes of different samples are summarized in Table 2. In ZSM-5, there are two desorption peaks observed at low temperature (Peak I, 235°C) and high temperature (Peak II, 416°C), which correspond to weak and strong acid sites, respectively. In comparison, the amount of acid sites in ZQ is decreased significantly in Fig. 6(a), especially for the strong acid sites. According to the above findings, and due to the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ material, these results might be attributed to the effective framework of Al atoms.36 The corresponding temperatures of both strong and weak acid sites of ZQ shift towards lower temperature compared with ZSM-5. Hence, the strength of acid sites in ZQ becomes weaker. Moreover, it is interesting to observe that new ammonia desorption appeared in ZQ at around 292°C (Peak III). This newly-found peak implies the emergence of some acid sites with moderate intensity, which could be attributed to the change in the state of Al species in the framework of ZQ. Similar results were found in previous work.37

Pyridine adsorption IR spectroscopy is another powerful technique for measuring and distinguishing acidic sites in samples. The pyridine adsorption by different samples is shown in Fig. 6(b). For both samples, it is clearly found that three pyridine absorption bands occur at 1448, 1490 and 1548 cm−1. The pyridine absorption bands at 1448 cm−1 and 1548 cm−1 are assigned to the absorption of pyridine on Lewis acid sites and Brönsted acid sites, respectively; the band at 1490 cm−1 is assigned to the absorption on both acid sites.4, 38 For the ZQ sample, compared with ZSM-5, the intensity of Brönsted acid sites becomes much smaller, while the intensity of Lewis acid sites is slightly increased. According to the results of FT-IR, this could be attributed to the change in the state of framework Al species in the ZQ sample. Combined with the NH3-TPD results, the weakened acidity of support will help to convert Brönsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and lead to a reduced coke formation rate during the reaction.39
For Pt-based catalyst, it is well known that two kinds of active Pt species exist on the external surface of the catalyst.40 One dominates the low temperature H2 adsorption, while another can absorb more H2 at high temperature. H2-TPD profiles under different conditions can be obtained by changing the hydrogen adsorption temperature. When the hydrogen adsorption is carried out from 600°C to room temperature, both active Pt sites can absorb hydrogen so that complete H2-TPD profiles can be obtained. As shown in Fig. 7, there are two main desorption peaks at low temperature and high temperature for different catalysts. In both catalysts it is worth noting that there is no obvious change in the hydrogen desorption peak at low temperature, which indicates that the active center of Pt is almost the same in the two catalysts. However, compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, the hydrogen desorption at high temperature is strongly increased in PtSnNa/ZQ. Generally speaking, this hydrogen desorption peak at high temperature is usually thought to be spillover hydrogen, and the M/A (M: the metallic active sites; A: the accepter of spillover hydrogen) interface is the most important one to influence this.41 In this circumstance, hydrogen can be dissociated to H atoms at the surface of Pt active sites and they may overflow to the surface of adjacent Pt oxides or the other Pt oxides that interact strongly with the carrier. In this way, the spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and the active sites of the catalyst can be stabilized in PtSnNa/ZQ, which is advantageous for the process of propane dehydrogenation reaction.

For different catalysts, in order to investigate the interactions between metal particles and supports after modification, the chemical state of catalyst components at the catalyst surface after reduction was tested by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Figure 8 shows the XPS spectra corresponding to the Sn 3d5/2 level of different catalysts after reduction at 500°C and the binding energies of Pt 4d5/2, Si 2p, Al 2p, Sn 3d5/2 are summarized in Table 3. In Fig. 8, by deconvolution of the spectrum of PtSnNa/ZSM-5, three peaks were obtained at 485.2, 486.5, 487.4 eV, assigned to different tin species. The component at lower binding energy is attributed to metallic state Sn (Sn0), while the others are ascribed to different types of oxides of tin (SnO and/or SnO2).42, 43 For tin, because their binding energies are very close, it is difficult to distinguish between Sn4+ and Sn2+ in XPS.44 As observed in Table 3, the percentage of Sn0 for PtSnNa/ZQ is 25.8%, which is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (29.1%). Generally, when Sn is in the zero state, Sn species could be alloyed with platinum to produce Pt-Sn alloy. In this case, it can result in metal Pt poisoning and the catalysts deactivating.45 Correspondingly more tin in a nonmetallic state (Sn4+ or Sn2+) was found in PtSnNa/ZQ (Table 3). This indicates that the structure modification of ZQ establishes strong interactions between tin species and the support, resulting in a significant amount of Sn species existing in an oxidized state and thus facilitating the Pt–Sn interaction.

The catalytic behaviors of different catalysts are depicted in Fig. 9 and the data listed in Table 4. It can be seen that hierarchical-pores in PtSnNa/ZQ have significant impacts on the catalytic conversion and its selectivity. The conversion and selectivity of PtSnNa/ZQ are both increased compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5. To explain this finding, it should be noted that the PtSnNa catalyst are bifunctional and the two active centers (the metal particles and the acid sites) might work collaboratively: dehydrogenation and ring opening might occur on the metal particles, whereas isomerization through carbonium-ion intermediates could occurs on the acid sites.46 As expected, more Sn exists in oxidized form (XPS results), which is favorable for the anchoring of Pt to Sn oxide. The Pt sites anchoring Sn oxide surface with ‘sandwich structure’ are the main reaction active sites of Pt-catalysts.40 In this case, more stabilized active sites for the catalyst, advantageous to the dehydrogenation of propane, are obtained. Reflected in Fig. 9(a), the equilibrium propane conversion of PtSnNa/ZQ is much higher than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5. Also, from the results of NH3-TPD, higher acid sites were obtained in ZSM-5 which generally promote the subsequent cracking reaction of the initially form C3+ carbenium ions.47 The dehydrogenation of propane is assumed to proceed through carbonium-ion intermediates.48 So the higher acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite is the main factor responsible for the lower selectivity to propene of PtSnNa/ZSM-5. In combination with the results in Table 4, the deactivation parameter of PtSnNa/ZQ (12.8%) is much lower than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (17.4%). These results demonstrate that PtSnNa/ZQ would be a better dehydrogenation catalyst, having higher propane conversion and catalytic stability.

To analyze the coke deposits on different catalysts, the TPO profiles of different catalysts were measured and are shown in Fig. 10. In the TPO profiles, two successive peaks representing different carbon deposits on the surface of catalysts are displayed. The carbon deposits corresponding to the first peak (at low temperature) cover the active center, while the second peak (at high temperature) represents one that is located on the external surface of the support.49 From Fig. 10, it can easily be seen that the total amount of coke deposits on PtSnNa/ZQ is much less than that on PtSnNa/ZSM-5, especially for the coke deposits on the external surface of the support. In order to confirm this result with great certainty, the peak areas of different coke deposits of catalysts are added. Table 5 lists the peak areas corresponding to the different coke deposits of catalysts, and coke quantitative analysis by the TGA method has also been carried out. In Table 5, it can be seen that the total amount of coke deposits drops significantly from PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (6.2%) to PtSnNa/ZQ (3.1%). The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke. In addition, the presence of Sn oxides in Pt catalyst weakens the binding energy between hydrocarbon and metal.50, 51 Thus, significant amounts of Sn oxides in the catalyst will promote the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to the external surface of the support. Besides, the weakened acidity of the support will help to convert Brönsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and lead to a reduced coke formation rate during the reaction.39 Based on the above results (NH3-TPD and XPS analysis), the coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support and the acid sites.52 As reflected in Table 5, compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the peak area of low temperature in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst is increased, while the area of high temperature is reduced significantly. This indicates that, on PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst, the coke precursor formed on the metal was highly suppressed and even migrated to the external surface of the support.

Based on the results obtained above, a model for the coke deposition on different catalysts is proposed (Fig. 11). As is known, there are two kinds of ‘hierarchical-pores’ existing in the PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. On the one hand, for the intracrystalline mesopores, the average pore size is far less than the particle size of platinum and the Pt particles cannot enter these pores in the catalyst. However, according to the results of Yue' group,53, 54 due to the better transport of the reactant and product molecules, the introduction of these intracrystalline mesopores in ZSM-5 improves the catalytic activity as well as the stability of the catalyst. On the other hand, for the large pores on the surface of the catalyst, these pores are large enough to anchor the platinum particles inside. Therefore, on PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, all of the metal particles are dispersed on the external surface of support, while the particles of platinum could be located in the hierarchical-pores of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst. Moreover, in this case, more Sn species existed in oxide states, which facilitate the anchoring of Pt particles on the catalysts. According to these effects, further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process is inhibited, leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. Moreover, by the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly. Therefore, during the reaction, the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbon–metal bonds, the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support.55 In these circumstances, carbon deposits on the active metal are reduced during the reaction of propane dehydrogenation. Consequently, this implies that PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke.

CONCLUSIONS
In this work, the effects of the modification of ZSM-5 zeolite on catalytic structure and the reaction performance of PtSnNa-based catalysts were investigated. The introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ not only modified the textual properties but also influenced the acid content of zeolite. XPS results indicate that more oxides of Sn could be anchored on the surface of ZQ zeolite. Moreover, the weakened acid sites and existence of oxide Sn in ZQ suppressed the coke precursor forming on the metal and even facilitated migration of the coke precursor to the external surface of the support. From TPO analysis, the carbon deposits on the metallic surface of PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst were strongly decreased, implying that Pt particles which located in the hierarchical-pores could avoid the rapid cover by carbon deposits. Based on these results, in comparison with traditional ZSM-5 zeolite, PtSnNa/ZQ possessed better propane conversion and greater stability of the catalyst. Further research should investigate the control of pore size distribution of the hierarchical-pores in zeolite.
