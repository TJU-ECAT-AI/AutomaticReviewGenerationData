Abstract 
Due to the depletion of petroleum and the recent shale gas revolution, the dropping of the 
price for light alkanes makes alkanes an attractive feedstock for the production of light 
alkenes and other valuable chemicals. Understanding the mechanism for the activation of C-
H bonds in hydrocarbons provides fundamental insights into this process and a guideline for 
the optimization of catalysts used for the processing of light alkanes. In the last two decades, 
density functional theory (DFT) became a powerful tool to explore elementary steps and 
mechanisms of many heterogeneously catalyzed processes at atomic scale. This review 
describes recent progress on computational understanding of heterogeneous catalytic 
dehydrogenation reactions of light alkanes. We start with a short description on basic 
concepts and principles of DFT as well as its application in heterogeneous catalysis. The 
activation of C-H bond over transition metal and alloy surfaces are then discussed in detail, 
followed by C-H activation over oxides, zeolites and catalysts with single atoms as active 
sites. The origin of coking formation are also discussed followed by a perspective on 
directions of future research.

Introduction  
Activation of hydrocarbons over heterogeneous catalysts is a dynamic and growing 
field of research since the birth of modern petroleum and natural gas industry. Recent 
development of hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” technologies have shown the ability to 
efficiently extract shale gas, which increased the supply of CH4 as well as other light 
alkanes, mainly ethane and propane,1 rendering them a cheap and reliable source for the 
chemical industry. 2  On the other hand, light alkenes are important feedstocks for the 
production of polymers, oxygenates and many other important chemical intermediates. 
Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and 
fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts.1 In 2007, 
95% of propylene was produced as a byproduct of ethylene plants and other refineries.3 
Although the recovery rate of propylene from a FCC unit have increased from 29% in 1980 
to ~80% in 2009, the fast growing demand for propylene still pushes up its price.4 Thus, an 
alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in 
profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene. 
Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or 
CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to 
coke formation remains a challenging issue.5 Moreover, since the PDH is an endothermic 
reaction (∆H298K = 124 kJ mo-1), high reaction temperatures favor transformation from 
propane to propylene. However, the undesired deep dehydrogenation leading to the coke 
formation is also enhanced at high temperatures. Thus, the development of strategies to 
avoid the coke formation is an important field of research. The robustness against coking can 
be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main group metals 
including Sn and Ga, alkali oxides and rare earth metal oxides.6 However, the nature of 
atomic structure of these promoters during the dehydrogenation process is still under debate.  
Besides the production of propylene, the activation of the C-H bond in methane is also 
an important but challenging process. The relatively stable methane C-H σ bond, the 
negative electron affinity, the large ionization energy, the absence of a dipole moment and 
the extremely high pKa renders methane highly resistant to attacks by most redox active 
reagents, acids and bases. One of the most widely used technologies is the reforming process. 
It converts methane as well as other hydrocarbons into synthesis gas or hydrogen (with other 
byproducts), which can be further used in various processes to yield value added chemicals. 
Although this process was extensively studied for nearly half century, researchers were still 
trying to gain more insights into the reforming process by means of modern (in situ) 
characterization techniques, as well as theoretical calculations.7  
In the last few decades, density functional theory (DFT) became a powerful tool for 
studying heterogeneous catalytic processes and their elementary steps and mechanisms at

atomic scale. Such an “atomic resolution” of the processes is very hard to be achieved 
experimentally. Along with the development of novel computational architectures and the 
exponential increase in computational processor speed, the catalytic systems treated by DFT 
have developed from simple models such as metal or oxide single crystal surfaces to more 
sophisticated ones including alloys, supported catalysts and zeolites etc. In addition, with 
advanced kinetic modeling, the rate constants of elementary steps calculated with DFT can 
be further converted to turnover rate under reaction conditions. By applying linear 
correlations between activation energies and descriptors, e.g. binding energy or BEP 
relationship, the activity and selectivity of a chemical process can be deduced from a small 
number of descriptors instead of from a large amount of detailed, but also hard to overview, 
information of all elementary steps. As the reaction rates are essentially governed by only a 
few descriptors, a large number of potential catalysts can be screened fast by means of 
computational chemistry.8,9 Nevertheless, the fundamental understanding offered by DFT 
calculations still serves as a cornerstone in the complete process of computer-aided catalytic 
design (Fig. 1).

Background of DFT calculations in heterogonous catalysis 
For the investigation of solid states, DFT is an important and powerful method for 
quantum mechanical modeling developed in the last century. The origin of DFT can be 
traced back to the Thomas-Fermi model in 1920s.11,12 From 1960s, the formulation of DFT 
addressed by Kohn and Sham (KS) becomes the basis of current routinely used 
computational methods. 13 In the KS formalism, the entire unknown part of the energy 
functional is collected in the exchange-correlation energy EXC, where approximations are 
used. The approximation can have different levels of sophistication, which is compared by 
Perdew and Schmidt to the rungs of the “Jacob’s ladder” of density functional 
approximations.14 Nowadays, most popular functionals are mainly at the second rung, i.e. 
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level, for example Perdew-Wang199115 (PW91) 
and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof16 (PBE) functionals, which feature a high accuracy-to-cost 
ratio for many applications. However, for studies on heterogeneous catalyst, both PW91 and 
PBE functionals have several shortcomings, including over binding of surface 
intermediates 17  and lack of van der Waals (vdW) dispersion interactions. 18  The later 
developed revised PBE functional (RPBE17) improves the reproducibility of experimental 
binding energies for surface species. Recently, more attempts have been done in order to 
account for vdW dispersion between non-overlapped densities with several different 
approaches, and a new family of “vdW” functionals, like vdW-DF,19 BEEF-vdW20 etc, have 
been developed. The performance of functionals at different levels have been compared in 
several test studies.21,22  
To model a catalytic particle/surface, the simplest and most common way is to employ 
a slab model of a low Miller index surface, with typically 3-6 atomic layers thickness in case 
of modeling metals. The terrace, edge and corner atoms on a metal particle can be 
approximately described by corresponding atoms on flat, step and kink surfaces, respectively. 
However, if the studied catalyst consists of ultra-small nanoparticles or sub-nanometer 
clusters, a non-periodical cluster model may be more reasonable due to the existence of 
quantum size effect.23 Recent researches start to take support into account, using either a 
metal cluster/particle,24 an 1-D periodic nanowire,25 or a 2-D periodic catalyst slab supported 
on a 2-D periodic support slab. The former two types of models, i.e. supported clusters or 
nanowires, explicitly contains the sites at metal/support interface, which may be essential for

the understanding of the catalytic activity at catalyst-support interface of a bi-functional 
catalyst.  
To describe a reaction, at least three data points need to be located on the potential 
energy surface: the initial, transition and final states. The optimization of initial and final 
states are relatively simple. However, the identification of a transition state structure, which 
is a saddle point on the potential energy surface, is more challenging and computationally 
expensive. Moreover, due to the lack of analytical second derivative for plane wave based 
DFT code, so-called mode-following methods which find transition states by following low 
curvature directions from energy minima are not easily implemented.26 The most widely 
used methods in this area can be categorized into two groups: (1) Elastic Band (EB) method 
and its improvements like the Nudged Elastic Band method (NEB) and the climbing image 
Nudged Elastic Band method;27 (2) dimer method.28 The EB family of methods locate a 
transition state by simultaneously optimizing a chain of structures between initial and final 
states, which are connected by “elastic band”. In the dimer method, the algorithm moves two 
images (dimer) uphill along the lowest curvature mode, which is estimated according to 
Voter’s hyperdynamics method without evaluating the Hessian matrix, on potential energy 
surface.28 Because of the complexity associated with the identification of a transition state, 
other attempts have been done to estimate the reaction barrier without explicitly obtaining 
the transition state structure and energy. Widely used ones include the Brønsted-Evans-
Polanyi (BEP) relationship29 and other types of scaling relationship. All of these attempts try 
to get linear correlations between activation barriers and other easily calculated quantities, or 
so called descriptors, such as reaction energies,29 d band center of metal slabs,30 and atomic 
binding energies.31 
The energetics obtained directly from DFT calculations describe the potential energy 
surface at 0 K and 0 bar. To describe a chemical process under realistic reaction conditions, 
thermodynamic corrections are necessary, which includes the zero point energy as well as 
the contributions to enthalpy and entropy at higher temperature and pressure. These 
corrections can be easily calculated according to statistical thermodynamics for ideal gas. 
However, the corrections for an adsorbed system, especially for the soft frustrated translation 
and rotation modes, are not always well defined. Unfortunately, these soft modes have a 
large contribution to the total entropy. Thus, they cannot be completely ignored. Several 
different approaches have been made to estimate this entropy, including treating soft modes 
same as other vibration modes,32 employing a harmonic well model,33 or estimating from gas 
phase entropy values.34  
Although the calculated reaction energies and barriers of elementary steps provide

useful clues to interpret the reaction mechanism, a more reliable way is to solve the steady-
state at reaction conditions based on the calculated kinetic and thermodynamic information. 
Two common approaches include micro-kinetic modeling, which uses a mean-filed 
description,33 and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation with includes the explicit 
consideration of the correlations, fluctuations and spatial distributions of the adsorbates at 
the catalyst surface35. By including the linear relationship between barriers and descriptors 
mentioned above, the activity and selectivity predicated by kinetic analysis can be projected 
from a high dimension space including information of all elementary steps to a simple 
descriptor space, and a volcano plot can be generated for a direct guide to locate the optimal 
catalyst.36

Metal surfaces 
3.1 Pure metal surfaces 
3.1.1  Methane activation 
As the simplest hydrocarbon, activation of methane on transition metal surfaces has 
been used numerous times as a model system since the early stage of theoretical calculations. 
As early as 1996, Kratzer et al. 37  reported a barrier at 108 kJ mol-1 for the first 
dehydrogenation step on Ni(111), which is one of the most widely calculated metals for 
methane decomposition due to its application in steam methane reforming process.38 Till 
now, the activation of methane is still a hot topic, owing to the recent shale gas boom. 
Although the steam reforming process is now widely used in the modern chemical industry, 
other alternative routes to process methane are still quite challenging. Such alternative 
processes include, among others, the direct conversion of methane to other valuable 
chemicals or the dry CO2 reforming which not only reduces greenhouse emission but also 
produces a H2/CO mixture with a H2/CO ratio adequate for the Fischer-Tropsch process.39 
Understanding the activation mechanism of C-H bond in methane serves as the first step to 
tackle the nature of various processes for methane conversion. In the following, we denote, 
for convenience, the xth dehydrogenation step as Dx.  
Methane dehydrogenation on fcc (111) and hcp (0001): Table 1 collected parts of 
previously calculated reaction energies and barriers of CH4 decomposition steps over close 
packed fcc (111)40-60 or hcp (0001)61 surfaces. The most obverse signature for this series of 
reactions is the relatively high barriers for the first (D1) and last (D4) dehydrogenation steps, 
among many of which the barriers are higher than 100 kJ mol-1 (Table 1). In contrast, the 
barriers for D2 and D3 steps are mostly less than 80 kJ mol-1, and can be even as low as < 10 
kJ mol-1. A necessary condition to form such trend is the similar transition states of these

dehydrogenation reactions over hexagon-shaped fcc (111) or hcp (0001) surfaces: the C-H 
bond is activated by interacting simultaneously with a surface metal atom, forming C-M-H 
three-membered ring structure (Fig. 2).  
At least two factors contribute to the relative high barriers of D4 among all four 
dehydrogenation steps, electronically and geometrically. The electronic effect is influenced 
by the relative stability of dehydrogenated intermediates. CH is the most stable surface 
intermediate during the dehydrogenation process.29 The following D4 step starting from CH 
is always strongly endothermic and leads to a high thermodynamic barrier (i.e. reaction 
energy), over 50 kJ mol-1, on many calculated surfaces. Meanwhile, geometrically the 
perpendicular nature of CH is not favorable for further dehydrogenation, where an energy 
penalty needs to be applied to bend the structure parallel to surface in the transition state (Fig. 
2). Both effects tend to push up the barrier of D4 step. Similar strong bending of the 
adsorbate is also necessary for the D1 step, in order to move the C atom more close to the 
metal surface in the transition state.

Table 1 also shows that, in general, CH4 decomposition barriers become higher along 
with the surface metal elements moving to the right of the periodic table. Following the 
Nilsson and Pettersson model, 62  the interaction between doubly occupied orbitals of 
adsorbates and high electron occupied d orbitals is repulsive. As we move to the right of 
periodic table from Ru, there are more electrons filled in the metal d band, and the repulsion 
between occupied orbital interactions becomes stronger. It leads to weak binding of surface 
intermediate, as well as poor stabilization of transition states. Deeper dehydrogenation 
removes H atoms from the adsorbed intermediate, which results in more C-metal interaction,

and eventually leads to higher reaction barriers. Indeed, the total thermodynamic for CH4 = 
C* + 4H* is exothermic by 21 kJ mol-1 on Ru(0001), where Ru has 7 electrons in d band,. 
However, on Cu(111) where Cu has fulfilled d band, this process becomes strongly 
endothermic by 364 kJ mol-1, which is even much higher than highest kinetic barrier over 
Ru(0001). It has been suggested that this effect can be simply characterized by the d band 
center solely, where stronger binding of the adsorbate is expected in case of a metal with 
higher d band center (Fig. 3).63

Another interesting observation is the high D1 barriers (> 100 kJ mol-1) on third row 
metals compared with the D1 barriers (< 100 kJ mol-1) on fourth or fifth row metals. For 
elements in the same column, the main difference between them is the extension of the d 
atomic orbitals.29 The 3d orbitals of Ni, Co and Cu are more contracted, while the lower ones 
in fourth or fifth row with larger extension of the d atomic orbitals, which leads to 
preferential adsorption of the adsorbates such as CH3, CO or NH3 on top sites .64 This 
process minimizes the similar repulsion interaction,29 which result in the stronger binding 
and lower barrier for 4d and 5d series.

surface atoms have a coordination number (CN) of 8. On Ni(100), the rate determining step 
for CH4 decomposition is the D1 step, with more than 120 kJ mol-1 barrier. The barriers of 
the other three steps are < 65 kJ mol-1. Interestingly, all four dehydrogenation barriers on

Ni(100) are lower than the corresponding ones on Ni(111), which has been connected to the 
higher d band center of Ni(100) surface (-1.64 eV) than of Ni(111) (-1.78 eV).46 Besides the 
electronic effect, a strong stabilization of adsorbed C atoms was observed on Ni(100), which 
binds > 100 kJ mol-1 stronger than a C atom on Ni(111). The more stable tetra-coordinated C 
on Ni(100) reflects the needs of a C atom to satisfy its valence.46 It further results in that the 
D4 barrier is only 62 kJ mol-1 on Ni(100), much lower than the barrier on Ni(111), which are 
larger than 120 kJ mol-1. Similar stabilization of adsorbed carbon atom and low barriers of 
D4 steps were also observed on Cu(100)50,65 and Rh(100).51  
Methane dehydrogenation on stepped fcc (211) surfaces: Compared with barriers on 
terrace (111) surfaces, lower dehydrogenation barriers of D1 and D4 were reported on 
stepped (211) surfaces.49,50,66 The first clue related to this observation is the existence of low 
coordinated step atoms on (211) surfaces. Since the binding strength of surface intermediates 
tends to increase along with the decreasing of coordination number,32 there is more 
stabilization of transition and final states of D1 step at low coordinated step site of (211) 
than them on corresponding (111) surfaces. However, the initial state of this reaction is 
physically adsorbed CH4 whose binding strength is not influenced by the coordination 
number of surface atoms. Thus, D1 barriers on the (211) step edge are lower than the 
corresponding ones on the (111) terrace site. In the following D2-D4 dehydrogenation steps, 
all the initial, transition and final state have already bound to edge sites, and the additional 
stabilization between the low coordinated edge atoms and adsorbed intermediates mostly 
cancels out. In addition, the geometry effect also influences the relative barrier heights of 
these steps on step and terrace surfaces. Additional bending in the transition states of D3 step 
on Rh(211)50 and Cu(211)49 induces higher D3 barriers on (211) surfaces than the 
corresponding barriers on (111). While reverse effects were observed for the D4 step, 
resulting in lower barriers on (211) surfaces.49,50  
Methane steam reforming on transition metal surfaces: Jones et al.7 performed a 
detailed kinetic analysis on the methane steam reforming reactions over more than 10 
transition metal surfaces. By applying linear scaling relationships between the binding 
energies of selected molecular fragments, which serve as descriptors, and the binding 
energies of intermediates as well as of transition states that occur in the reforming process, 
the reaction rate (as characterized by the turn over frequency) can be simply mapped to a two 
dimensional descriptor space, which is defined by the binding energy of C and O in that 
study. As indicated in Fig. 4, theoretical calculations predict that the steam reforming 
activity decreases in the row Ru > Rh > Ni > Ir > Pt ≈ Pd, which is comparable with 
experimental observations showing Ru ≈ Rh > Ni ≈ Ir ≈ Pt ≈ Pd.7 The small discrepancies

might arise due to the different morphology of the nanoparticles under experimental 
conditions, as well as due the uncertainty of DFT calculations and the errors introduced by 
the scaling scheme.

3.1.2  Ethylene dehydrogenation 
Ethylene transformation is one of the most widely studied model system to understand 
hydrogenation / dehydrogenation reactions. On Pt(111), ethylene is known to form two types 
of adsorption complexes: π-adsorbed ethylene has been observed at very low temperatures or 
in coadsorbed systems whereas a transformation to a di-σ bonded species begins upon 
heating above 52 K.67 Further heating of the surface will lead to conversion to ethylidyne, 
CH3−C≡, on many transition metal surfaces such as Pt(111), 68  Rh(111), 69  Pd(111), 70 
Ir(111)71 and Ru(0001).72 Although the transformation from ethylene to ethylidyne seems 
simple with only one H atom removed from hydrocarbon, the mechanism of this 
transformation has long been debated. Based on the extensive kinetic and spectroscopic 
studies, Zaera and French73 suggested a two-step mechanism of ethylidyne formation: a 
direct 1,2-H shift reaction converts ethylene to ethylidene (CH3CH), followed by a 
dehydrogenation reaction to form ethylidyne. 
However, a later theoretical study74 provided strong evidence against the two-step 
mechanism. The calculated 1,2-H-shift barrier from ethylene to ethylidene was as high as 
~200 kJ mol-1 on Pt(111). Similar high barriers for H shift reactions were also observed on

Pt(110),75 Pt(211),58 Pd(111),76 Rh(111)77 and Fe(100).78 Although the substrate metals or 
surface structures are different from each other, a common observation for this type of H-
shift reaction is a C-H-C three membered ring transition state structure. The C-H-C ring does 
not directly interact with surface metal atoms, indicating little assistance of the metal catalyst 
in stabilizing the transition state during this conversion.  
Even the hydrogen shift reactions have been excluded due to its high barrier, there are 
still at least three competing pathways for this conversion: (1) CH2CH2-CH2CH-CH3CH-
CH3C; (2) CH2CH2-CH2CH-CH2C-CH3C; (3) CH2CH2-CH3CH2-CH3CH-CH3C (Fig. 5a). 
DFT calculations indicate74 that at low coverage (1/9 ML), the conversion prefers a 
mechanism via two consecutive dehydrogenation steps to form CH2CH and then CH2C, with 
a final hydrogenation step to form CH3C (Fig. 5b). When the coverage increased to 1/3 ML, 
the dehydrogenation barrier increases in general by ~20 kJ mol-1.74 The dominated 
mechanism still starts from dehydrogenation to CH2CH, but shifts to hydrogenation reaction 
in the second step to form CH3CH and the last dehydrogenation to form CH3C (Fig. 5b).

Due to the existence of the coverage effect, it is not easy to identify dominated reaction 
mechanism under reaction conditions purely based on DFT-calculated barriers. Further 
clarification of the mechanistic scenario is achieved by kMC simulations, which allow one to 
track explicitly the behavior of all surface species as a function of time and processing 
conditions. The kMC study79 predicts the conversion of ethylene starts at temperatures as 
low as 230 K on Pt(111). The dominated mechanism predicted by kMC follows the route (2) 
CH2CH2-CH2CH-CH2C-CH3C. The third hydrogenation step is rate limiting, which results 
in the accumulation of CH2C on surface. Interestingly, in some cases, even with a lower 
hydrogenation barrier, these hydrogenation steps can still be slower than dehydrogenation 
steps with a higher barrier due to the limited amount of adsorbed hydrogen atoms. 
Indeed, experimentalists observed an intermediate during ethylene conversion on 
Pt(111). Spectroscopic studies with sum frequency generation (SFG) 80  and reflection 
adsorption inferred spectroscope (RAIRS)81 methods observed a peak at ~2960 cm-1 and 
assign it to asymmetric stretching of CH3 group in CH3CH. A second peak at 1387 cm-1 was 
observed which developed in parallel with the 2960 cm-1 feature by the latter study and was 
assigned to the symmetric bending of ethylidene. Both assignments contradict with the very 
low DFT barrier for dehydrogenation of ethylidene as well as the kMC simulation results, 
which indicate accumulation of vinylidene instead of ethylidene during ethylene conversion. 
Further DFT calculations74 indicated that both vinylidene and ethylidene have modes which 
locate close to 2960 and 1387 cm-1 due to the structure similarity of these C2 intermediates. 
Moreover, with deuterium substituted spectra, the C-C stretching mode of vinylidene is

separated by at least 200 cm-1 with modes belonging to ethylidene, suggesting a possible 
way to identify this puzzling intermediate by future experiment.82   
The formation mechanism of ethylidyne has also been studied on Pd(111)79,83,84 and 
Rh(111).77 On both surfaces, kinetic analyses predict that the dominated reaction mechanism 
is via the vinyl and vinylidene route, which is the same as on Pt(111). In general, the 
hydrogenation-dehydrogenation barrier heights follow the trend Rh(111) < Pt(111) < 
Pd(111),85 which can again be qualitatively explained by the filling of d band, as discussed 
in methane decomposition (section 3.1).  
The binding of surface intermediates tend to be stronger on (211) surfaces than it on 
corresponding terrace (111),58,76 due to the low coordinated nature of step edge atoms. 
Besides the enhanced binding, CH3CH dehydrogenation barriers on (211) surfaces are 
significantly higher (e.g., over 80 kJ mol-1) than the corresponding barriers (<40 kJ mol-1) on 
(111) surfaces. By checking the transition state structures, one can notice that this reaction is 
mainly catalyzed by a terrace metal atom, which is in the second row away from the step 
edge, although the reactant CH3CH and product CH3C directly binds to step edge. It leads to 
similar absolute energy of the transition state on both (111) and (211) surfaces. Thus, the 
barrier is higher on (211) because the initial CH3CH binds much stronger at step edge 
compared to it on (111).  
C-C bond breaking vs dehydrogenation: As discussed in the ethylene conversion to 
ethylidyne section, only hydrogenation / dehydrogenation occur at low temperature range, 
e.g. below 400K on Pt(111). Ethylidyne can be further dehydrogenated and coke can be 
formed at higher temperatures.86 Chen and Vlachos calculated all the possible C-C scission 
barriers from different C2 species on Pt(111) and Pt(211). On flat (111), most of the C-C 
bond breaking barriers are higher than 150 kJ mol-1, except for three cases, CC breaking 
from CH3CH (Ea = 114 kJ mol-1), CHCH (Ea = 103 kJ mol-1) and CHC (Ea = 88 kJ mol-1). 
Although the C-C breaking from CHC has low barrier at 88 kJ mol-1, they still proposed that 
C-C bond breaking might not via this pathway due to strong endothermicity of this step and 
the high formation barrier of CHC (> 200 kJ mol-1). Instead, CHCH or CH3CH are more 
likely to be the precursor for C-C bond breaking on Pt(111). Since the highest 
dehydrogenation barrier during ethylene conversion to ethylidyne is below 100 kJ mol-1, the 
higher C-C bond breaking barriers prevent C2 cracking at low temperatures, which is 
consistent with the fact that C-C scission reaction can only occur over 540K.87 Stepped 
Pt(211) in general shifts down C-C scission barriers from light dehydrogenated intermediates, 
and shifts up the ones from deep dehydrogenated intermediates. It is more likely that CHCH 
to be precursor of C-C bond scission, with barrier at 123 kJ mol-1. Although the lowest C-C

breaking barrier is from CH3CH2, it might not be the precursor because of the lack of surface 
H particularly after CH3C is formed prior to the C-C bond breaking. 
As shown in Fig. 6, the lowest C-C bond breaking barrier on Pd(111) is 122 kJ mol-1 
and the corresponding precursor is the C2 dimer.88 However, the formation of the C2 dimer 
suffers from a high dehydrogenation barrier (154 kJ mol-1) from CHC. Hence, Chen et al. 
suggested88 that the formation of C1 species is most probably via a CH2C → CHC → CH + 
C pathway, where the precursor to form CH2C can be CH3C or CH2CH2 depending on the 
reaction conditions. The calculated CH-C dissociating barrier is 138 kJ mol-1, higher than the 
dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this 
conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations.89 A later study 
extended this network to Pd(211) surfaces, which again suggested same CH2C → CHC → 
CH + C pathway for C-C scission. However, on stepped surfaces, rate determining step is 
CH3-C dehydrogenation to CH2C or C-C scission from CHC, whose barriers are both about 
25 kJ mol-1 higher than dehydrogenation barrier from CH2C to CHC.

A simpler reaction network was employed by Vang et al.90 to check the selectivity of 
ethylene dehydrogenation and cracking (C-C bond scission) on Ni surfaces (Fig. 7). It

from CH2CH2 and CHCH. On Ni(111), the initial dehydrogenation from ethylene is much

more favorable than its cracking to form two CH2 groups, with about 50 kJ mol-1 lower 
dehydrogenation barrier. On stepped Ni(211), the ethylene cracking barrier dramatically 
decreases to about 100 kJ mol-1, which is comparable to its dehydrogenation barrier. The 
reduced barrier height of ethylene cracking, when comparing step sites with terrace sites, 
was explained by the geometry effect.90 The two CH2 groups, which are the final state of this 
cracking, locate on two threefold hollow sites on Ni(111). On Ni(211), one methylene 
adsorbs on a twofold sites, resulting in a much shorter the distance between two CH2 groups 
than the pairs on Ni(111). It means that the transition state is stabilized at an earlier point in 
the former case, and thus the barrier of this reaction is lower on Ni(211). Nevertheless, step 
edge sites are far more reactive towards ethylene decomposition than the regular sites on 
Ni(111), and thus play a very important role in the bond breaking selectivity between the 
initial C-H and C-C bond breaking.90

3.1.3  Propane dehydrogenation 
Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in chemical industries.1 
Nowadays, it is dominantly produced by steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic 
cracking of heavy oil. Along with the decreasing fossil oil reserves and development on 
utilization of nature gas and shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) seems to be a 
promising alternative to produce propylene. Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be 
categorized in to two groups: Cr-based catalyst and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of 
Pt-based catalyst is its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke 
formation. Yang et al.91,92,93 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111),

Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 C-C bond 
breaking steps. The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of 
Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers. A stronger 
activity of the stepped surface for the dehydrogenation mechanism has also been reported by 
a work of Chiu et al. originally addressing the hydrogenation of propylene on the stepped 
Pt(221) surface.94 Since the desired product propylene is only partially dehydrogenated from 
propane, lower dehydrogenation barrier as well as stronger propylene binding will cause 
deep dehydrogenation and reduce the selectivity towards propylene. Yang et al.93 also 
experimentally compared activity and selectivity of ~12 nm cubic and octahedral Pt particles, 
which expose large area of Pt(100) and Pt(111), respectively. Although turn over frequencies 
(TOFs) showed that the cubic particles are more active than octahedral ones, higher 
propylene selectivity was observed on octahedral Pt with large surface area of Pt(111). On 
Pt(100), the binding energy of propylene is 118 kJ mol-1, which is 66 kJ mol-1 higher than its 
dehydrogenation barrier. The binding of propylene on Pt(111) decreases to 94 kJ mol-1, and 
the following dehydrogenation increases to 73 kJ mol-1. Smaller barrier difference on Pt(111) 
indicates a stronger preference for propylene desorption on Pt(111) compared with Pt(100). 
Although desorption barriers are higher than dehydrogenation barrier from propylene on 
both surfaces, the experimental observed selectivities of propylene are still higher than 85% 
in both cases. The reason is that DFT results discussed here did not include thermodynamic 
correction, which would significantly reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps due 
to the large entropy of gas phase propylene compared with the adsorbed ones.

3.1.4  Methylcyclopentane dehydrogenation 
Cetane number is an important factor in determining the quality of diesel fuel. With 
the same number of C atoms, cetane number in general follows the rule of linear alkane > 
branched alkane > cyclo alkane > aromatics. In order to increase the quality of diesel fuel, 
the aromatics can be saturated and subsequently cracked by advanced upgrading 
technologies, with preference to form more linear products and preserving the initial 
molecular weight. As a model selective-ring-opening reactions, ring-opening of 
methylcyclopentane on supported metal catalysts has extensively been studied. One 
interesting observation by previous studies is the particle size effect on Pt catalyst: large Pt 
particles prefer to produce branched pentanes, while small Pt particles equally break the 
endocyclic C-C bonds and generate statistic distribution of branched and linear C6 products. 
DFT calculations95,96 attempted to model nanoparticles with different sizes by employing 
different types of surfaces, with Pt(111) to represent terrace rich large particles and Pt(211) 
for the edge rich small particles. The calculations indicate that a deep dehydrogenated 
precursor is necessary before the C-C bond breaking, which is similar as cracking of C2 and 
C3 hydrocarbons discussed above. The dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation barriers, 
which are prior and after C-C bond breaking, respectively, are very similar to each other in 
all three ring-opening pathways (Fig. 9). However, transition states and barriers of the C-C 
bond breaking vary notably. In the reaction path to branched products on Pt(111), this barrier 
is about 75 kJ mol-1 via an ααββ-tetra-adsorbed cyclic intermediate. Due to the existence of 
the CH3 group attached to a dissociating C atom, only an ααβ-tri-adsorbed cyclic 
intermediate can be formed in the reaction path to linear n-hexane (nHx). The corresponding 
C-C breaking barrier increases to 116 kJ mol-1 on Pt(111), which is at least 27 kJ mol-1 
higher than the barriers of all other elementary steps, including the ones on the path to 2MP 
and 3MP (Fig. 9).95 Due to this high rate-limiting barrier, the formation of nHx is suppressed 
on large Pt particles, which expose large surface area of Pt(111). However, the C-C cleavage 
barrier in the pathway to nHx decreases to 79 kJ mol-1 at step edge via an αγ-di-adsorbed 
intermediate.96 This barrier height is comparable to the hydrogenation / dehydrogenation 
steps, resulting in a statistical distribution of three products on small particles.

Similar analysis has further been done on Rh, Ir and Pd surfaces, with the assumption 
that deep dehydrogenation precedes ring cleavage.97 Based on the calculated barriers, the 
ring-opening activity follows the trend of Rh ≈ Ir > Pt > Pd, which agrees with experimental 
observations. The particle size effect on selectivity of MCP ring-opening products can also 
be rationalized by the calculated C-C bond breaking barriers. For example, the C-C breaking 
barrier leading to branched product is always lower on both Rh(111) and Rh(211) than 
barrier in the pathway to linear nHx, which consists with experimentally observed favored 
production of branched methylpentanes.  
3.2 Alloy surfaces 
3.2.1  Methane dehydrogenation on alloys 
One early attempt to probe the effect of alloying on the CH4 dissociation is on 
Au/Ni(111) by Kratzer et al.37 In their model, one or two surface Ni atoms are replaced by 
Au atoms. Gold itself is unreactive with respect to CH4 dissociation, and blocks at least one 
active site by substitution of one surface Ni atom. Moreover, the existence of Au atoms also 
changes the electronic structure of neighboring Ni atoms, which leads to higher dissociation 
barriers, by 16 kJ mol-1 and 38 kJ mol-1 on a Ni atom with one and two gold neighbors, 
respectively, compared with the barrier on clean Ni(111) (Fig. 10). The existence of Au 
atoms shifts down the d band of alloys, which weakens the interaction between σ* of C-H 
bond and d states of surface metal atoms. Thus, the transition state gains less stabilization 
from surface atoms, and finally results in the incensement of the dissociation barrier height. 
A similar study by Fan et al.43 covers more X/Ni(111) surfaces, with X to be seven types of

late transition metals, including Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Pt, and Au. It clearly shows that a 
higher barrier on Ni2X site for all dehydrogenation steps in case with a less 
dehydrogenation-active metals, such as Cu, Ag and Au, embedded in Ni(111). In contrast, 
embedding a more dehydrogenation-active metal, e.g. Ru and Rh, tends to decrease the 
dehydrogenation barrier on Ni2X due to more empty d orbitals introduced by Ru and Rh. 
The last two metals, Pd and Pt, have similar dehydrogenation activity as Ni, and the 
dehydrogenation barriers on Ni2X site are similar to the values on Ni(111). On Ni3 sites 
without direct interaction with embedded X atom, the indirect electronic effect which is 
introduced by the embedded X atom shifts up most of dehydrogenation barriers, except for 
the case of Cu/Ni(111). In the latter case, all four dehydrogenation barriers are ~5 kJ mol-1 
lower than corresponding values on Ni(111). Note that this set of barriers are in 
disagreement with an earlier study An et al.98 who reported the calculated barriers for all four 
dehydrogenation steps on Cu/Ni(111) are higher than the corresponding barriers on Ni(111).

In case with a more reactive Rh atom embedded to a less r Cu(111) surface, the 
situation is slightly different. The C-Rh bond is roughly ~50 kJ mol-1 stronger than C-Cu 
bond.53 In the first dehydrogenation step, the reaction can be catalyzed by the single Rh atom 
on the embedded Rh/Cu(111) surface. Thus, the calculated barrier of D1 on Rh/Cu(111), 68 
kJ mol-1, is almost the same as the barrier on perfect Rh(111), 67 kJ mol-1. However, the 
subsequent dehydrogenation step generates methylene which binds to bridge sites, forming

one C-Rh and one C-Cu bond. As expected, the D2 barrier on Rh/Cu(111), 81 kJ mol-1, is 40 
kJ mol-1 higher than the barrier on Rh(111), because of the weaker binding of the product 
methylene on the anterior surface.  
Besides the embedded model mentioned above, Kokalj et al.53 further considered a 
case with a Rh as an ad-atom on hollow sites of Rh(111) as well as on Cu(111). The 
coordination number of the ad-atom is only 3, which is significantly smaller than CN of the 
surface atoms on (111) (CN = 9), (211) step edge (CN = 7) and ad-row atoms (CN = 5). It is 
expected that the strongest binding of a surface intermediate should be observed on ad-atom 
due to its smallest coordination number. However, the calculated binding energy indicates 
that the strongest binding occur on ad-row atoms. The discrepancy was explained53 by the 
formation of agnostic bond, which is a three-center C-H-metal interaction normally with two 
electrons. Due to the three agnostic bonds, fcc adsorbed eclipsed CH3 on Rh(111) is 40 kJ 
mol-1 more stable than the staggered confirmation. The agnostic bond have been observed 
between CH3 and Rh(111), Rh(211) and ad-row surfaces, except for the case of ad-atoms 
(Fig. 11). In the latest case, the CH3 binds to the ad-atom with C-Rh bond titled to surface 
normal. The closest H-Rh interaction is 250 pm, indicating much weaker agnostic bond 
interaction. Although the binding of CH3 is not the strongest, the ad-atom still can well 
stabilize the transition state. The D1 dissociation barriers catalyzed by ad-atoms are at least 
20 kJ mol-1 lower than the corresponding barriers on Rh(111) and Cu(111) surfaces. 
However, the D2 barriers become comparable or even higher on ad-atoms compared with the 
corresponding barriers on (111) surfaces. In the final state of D2, the CH2 group attaches to 
bridge site between the ad-atom (CN = 3) and a surface atom underneath (CN = 10), with an 
average CN = 6.5. Accordingly, the calculated binding energy of CH2 on the ad-atom / 
surface bridge site is similar to the value on step edge (CN = 7). Moreover, the dissociated H 
atom is about 20 kJ mol-1 less stable on top of ad-atoms than adsorption on other cases. The 
combination of both effects shifts up the D2 barrier on ad-atom.

A third type of studies covers the case with AB type alloy, in most case with A:B = 1:1. 
Qi et al.56 selected two metals, Pt and Ir, which are both active for CH4 dissociation. Instead 
of expected in between catalytic activity of alloy, the initial dehydrogenation activity is 
enhanced on PtIr(111), with a lower D1 barrier, 53 kJ mol-1, than barriers on Pt(111) (Ea = 
82 kJ mol-1) and Ir(111) (Ea = 90 kJ mol-1). Similar lowest barrier on alloy surfaces is also 
observed for the D2 step. However for D3 and D4, the calculated barriers on PtIr(111) is 
quite similar to values on Ir(111), and lower than the ones on Pt(111). The enhanced activity 
on alloys does not seem to be unique for PtIr(111). Similar lower barrier on alloy surfaces 
were also observed on PdNi(111)99 and NiCu(111),100 while in case of NiCo(111),101 the 
barriers are similar to the ones on Ni(111). 
3.2.2  Propane dehydrogenation on alloys 
Previous experimental studies have shown102,103 that the selectivity towards propylene 
during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition 
metals or main group metals like Cu and Sn. For example, Han et al. have shown that the 
selectivity towards propylene increase from < 80% achieved on supported Pt catalyst to 
about 90% after Cu is added to Pt during the catalyst preparation. The Pt-Cu catalyst inhibits 
the adsorption of formed propylene, and thus suppresses the secondary cracking reactions 
from propylene towards lighter hydrocarbons. Thus, this reduced interaction between the 
product and the catalysts enhances the anti-coking ability of the catalyst.102 Similar increased 
selectivity towards desired propylene as achieved on the Pt-Cu catalysts was also reported 
for the reaction on Pt-Sn/Al2O3.103 Indeed, DFT calculations104 -106 have shown that the 
binding energy of propylene is weakened by at least 8 kJ mol-1 after alloying different 
amount of Sn in Pt(111). Meanwhile, all the dehydrogenation barriers shift up (Fig. 12), 
including deep dehydrogenation from propylene. In combination with above two factors, the 
selectivity towards propylene on PtSn alloy is expected to be higher than that on pure Pt, 
although the total activity might be lower in case catalyzed by PtSn. Moreover, on stepped 
(211) surface, Sn atoms are more preferred at step edge in PtSn alloy,105 which significantly 
reduces the activity of deep dehydrogenation and cracking of propane on step edges. Similar 
as the discussion of alloy for methane dehydrogenation, the lower reactivity (i.e. higher 
dehydrogenation barrier) on PtSn alloy is due to the deeper d band center compared to it of 
pure Pt.

3.3 Metal clusters/particles 
In addition to the slab models, another widely used approach is the cluster model, in 
which the catalyst is described by a finite metal particle. The advantage of the cluster model 
is that various types of site, e.g. corner, edge as well as terrace, can be described 
simultaneously in one model. In addition, it is easy to set up a supported particle calculation. 
The size of metal particle is normally limited to hundreds of atoms, whose diameter is in 
range of several nanometers.  
In case of finite particle, the binding strength is also correlated to the size of the cluster 
besides the influence caused by the difference on coordination number. For example, a linear 
relationship between the size of Pd particles and the corresponding adsorption energy of CO 
has been established by Yudanov et al.107 The particle size affected binding energy is linked 
to the strain effects.30 Shorter Pd-Pd distance was observed in smaller Pd particle / clusters, 
which results in stronger binding of intermediates and transition states on small metal 
particles than on large ones and on edge sites of (211) surfaces. Viñes et al.59 has shown that 
the complete dehydrogenation of CH4 to form C atom and 4 H atom is more exothermic by 
128 kJ mol-1 on Pt79 than on Pt(111) (Fig. 13). Stronger binding of dehydrogenated 
intermediate on Pt79 significantly decreases the first dehydrogenation barrier of CH4, only 32

Enhanced dehydrogenation by small nanoparticles is not unique for methane. Vajda et 
al.108 reported that a size-preselected Pt8-10 cluster are 40-100 times more active for oxidative 
dehydrogenation of propane than previous studied platinum and vanadia catalysts. 
Calculations with a tetrahedral Pt4 cluster indicate the barrier for the first dehydrogenation of 
propane decreased to 41 kJ mol-1. Furthermore, further C-C bond breaking as well as 
dehydrogenation of the CH3 group from propylene have much higher barriers (e.g., over 100 
kJ mol-1) than the first two dehydrogenation steps to form propylene, which is consistent 
with the experimental observed high selectivity of propylene.108 The high barrier for the C-C 
bond breaking can be explained by the sp3 directionality of the orbitals on C compared with 
the spherical nature of the s orbital on hydrogen, which results in poorer overlap between 
adsorbate and the reaction site orbitals in the transition state for breaking C-C bond.108

Other catalysts  
4.1 Oxides 
Supported vanadium oxides are one of the best catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation 
(ODH) of propane.109 It is generally accepted that this catalytic process proceeds via a two-
step mechanism:110 (1) reduction of the oxide surface by dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon 
and (2) re-oxidation of the surface by gas phase O2. At high vanadium loadings, vanadium 
oxide exists in form of V2O5, whose most stable surface is the oxygen terminated basal 
V2O5(001). There are three different types of surface O atoms. Depending on the type of the

O center, the corresponding coordination number can be 1, 2 or 3. Previous experimental 
studies have suggested both the single coordinated111 and the di-coordinated112 surface O 
atoms to be the active site of ODH of propane. These suggestions are in line with DFT 
calculations by Fu et al.,110 which clearly showed that for propane activation on V2O5(001), 
the activation of C-H bond by tri-coordinated O atoms is least likely, as yielded propyl upon 
dehydrogenation of propane is least stable at the tri-coordinated O sites on V2O5(001). On 
the other two O active sites, similar dehydrogenation barriers for the initial step were 
obtained, with slight preference for the single coordinated O (Fig. 14). However, the di-
coordinated O has a higher activity for further decomposition of surface propoxide, i.e. the 
propyl bound to O site, into propylene. Nevertheless, one should be aware that a good 
catalyst for propane ODH should not only feature high activity for the dehydrogenation step 
but also yield a high selectivity towards desired product, i.e. propylene, over deep 
dehydrogenated ones. Unfortunately, these two properties of a catalyst are somewhat 
oppositional: a too high catalytic activity often comes in line with a decreased selectivity 
towards partially dehydrogenated propylene.110 Dai et al.113 focused on ODH of ethane on 
vanadium oxide, whose rate was much lower than ODH of propane. 114  DFT studies 
identified ODH mechanism from both ethane and propane are similar to each other: first C-
H dissociation step to be rate-limiting in both cases. However, in the case of ethane, the 
undesired acetaldehyde can be formed on the single coordinated O site with a barrier that is 
slightly lower than the barrier associated with ethylene formation. This undesired 
acetaldehyde is a stable species on the surface. However, it was suggested, although without 
having explicitly calculated the corresponding elementary steps, that acetaldehyde can be 
further oxidized to CO or CO2 under the typical ODH reaction conditions. The presence of 
this easily accessible side reaction significantly lower the efficiency of ethane ODH, which 
was suggested to be the reason for the low ODH activity of ethane on V2O5.

Ga2O3 is another highly active and selective catalyst for the production of alkenes via 
alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, such catalysts deactivate quickly, which was 
suggested to be a consequence poisoning by carbon deposition formed in light alkane 
dehydrogenation reactions. 115  Liu et al. 116  employed a slab model for β-Ga2O3 and 
considered two competitive mechanism for dehydrogenation of propane, the direct 
dehydrogenation and the oxidative dehydrogenation. The study reveals that the direct 
dehydrogenation mechanism is preferred over the oxidative dehydrogenation. However, the 
latter mechanism could not be completely ruled out for reactions in the presence of mild 
oxidants as CO2. The most active site for the first dehydrogenation step is a bridge bound 
surface O atom. Once the H is abstracted from hydrocarbon, rather stable surface hydroxyl 
groups are formed (Fig. 15). The direct removal of the H, either as H2 or H2O, to regenerate 
the O site of the catalyst is difficult and will eventually decrease the activity of the catalyst. 
Upon blocking of the O site by the H atom, Ga centers can also catalyze the further 
dehydrogenation of the intermediate propyl. This leads to the formation of a hydrogenated 
Ga center “GaH” and facilitates the removal of surface H at the neighboring O sites in form 
of H2 or H2O.

dehydrogenation of butane to produce butylene with a chromia supported on alumina at 
industrial scale.1 Numerous of experimental attempts have been done in order to identify the 
active site and reaction mechanism for light alkane dehydrogenation reactions on chromium 
oxide, which was recently reviewed by Ref 1 and will not be repeated here. However, due to 
the complexity of the chromium oxide, including the different oxidation states, the crystal 
structure and the surface facets, theoretical studies addressing chromium oxide catalyzed 
dehydrogenation processes are challenging and thus rare.  
4.2 Zeolites  
Zeolites have been widely used as catalysts and/or supports for hydrocarbon cracking, 
alkylation, aromatization and isomerization reactions. 117  Due to the nature of its 3-D 
structure, theoretical studies of this system are either employing a finite cluster model 
describing the immediate surroundings of the active site, 118 or with 3-D periodic model to 
describe the complete structure of the zeolite system.119 At least two different mechanisms 
have been proposed by previous theoretical studies on zeolite catalyzed alkane 
dehydrogenation reactions: one proceeding via an alkyl intermediate and an alternative 
mechanism via a carbenium ion.118  
The dehydrogenation of alkanes in zeolites can be promoted by extra-framework metal 
atoms, such as Zn, In, Ga and Cu, which create new Lewis acid sites in zeolites.117 However, 
the nature and role of the extra-framework metals are still under debate. Previous studies 
have suggested that metal oxide or metal hydride clusters are the active sites for 
dehydrogenation reactions. A series of studies on the dehydrogenation of light alkanes 
catalyzed by Ga exchanged ZSM-5 have been done by Pidko et al.118,120 using a cluster 
approach. These studies considered four different possible species, Ga+, GaH2
+, GaH+2 and 
GaO+, to be the active centers. Among first three active site, Ga+ is the most stable form of 
extra-framework Ga in ZSM-5. However, because the filled d and s orbitals of Ga+ are 
energetically low lying under Fermi level, the Ga+ center is unable to donate or accept 
electrons, resulting in a high barrier (Ea = 374 kJ mol-1) for direct oxidative addition of 
ethane (Fig. 16).118 A two-step heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond is much more favorable 
with the highest barrier to be 233 kJ mol-1 (Fig. 16), due to the polarization induced by the 
interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga…O Lewis acid-base pair. Hydrogenated gallium 
species are less active than Ga+ as reflected by the higher activation energies for ethane 
dehydrogenation. At variance, the oxidized gallium GaO+ shows the lowest initial 
dehydrogenation barrier of ethane (Ea ≈ 100 kJ mol-1) and yields very stable intermediates, 
[C2H5-Ga-OH]+ or [C2H5O-Ga-H]+. However, the desorption of C2H4 from both 
intermediates leads to formation of [H-Ga-OH]+, from which the regeneration of active site

via H2 desorption is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically and kinetically.

For the Zn/ZSM-5 system, Pidko et al. 121 further considered a model with Zn at a 
distant location from the [AlO2]- framework units. The initial dehydrogenation barrier of 
ethane on such a Zn site is lower than the barrier at Zn of a conventional ion-exchange site. 
This is related to the stronger Lewis acidity in the former case caused by the indirect charge-
compensation.121 Once the [Zn-C2H5]+ is formed upon the dehydrogenation of ethane, the 
barrier of following one-step elimination of H2 and C2H4 strongly depends relative position 
of [Zn-C2H5]+ and H+ species. Thus, the presence of acidic protons in the catalyst can 
promote the regeneration of active site.121 Lower barriers for the initial dehydrogenation 
steps have been determined for the reaction at binuclear ZnOZn sites, which can be 
rationalized by the high Lewis basicity of the extra-lattice oxygen and strong steric stain of 
the active site. Both effects also lead to strong stabilization of the [Zn-C2H5…HO-Zn]2+ 
intermediate, resulting in a high activation barrier of 190 kJ mol-1 for the elimination of 
ethylene.  
The stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is also influenced by the structure of 
the zeolite framework. Joshi and Thomson122,123 shows that [GaH]2+ is more stable in a six-
membered ring structure than in eight-membered ring.122 In case with a more stable site, the 
interaction between reaction intermediates and active site is expected to be weaker.  The 
poorly stabilized transition states result in a relatively high barrier for C-H activation as well 
as decreases the catalytic activity of the system. On the other hand, the weakly binding of the 
intermediate on such sites favors the desorption of H2. Considering these two opposite

effects, their calculations suggest that the optimal Al-Al distance to be 453 pm 
corresponding to a minimum overall barrier, and propose a simple ‘structure-to-activity’ 
correlation based on the Sabatier principle (Fig. 17).122 Further thermochemical analysis 
indicates that pair-Al sites with larger Al-Al distances become more prevalent, which can be 
used for guideline of optimal Si/Al ratio for a given Ga loading.123

Besides the position of Al atoms, the topology of zeolite framework also affects 
dehydrogenation activity. Wannakao et al. 124  calculated the methane activation in Au 
substituted FAU, FER, ZSM-5 and MCM-22. In FAU, Au binds to three O atoms, while it is 
bi-coordinated in other three zeolites. The higher coordination number results in weaker 
binding of intermediates and transition states, leading to lower activity in FAU than in ZSM-
5. Apart from the effect of the coordination of the extra-framework Au center, the pore size 
is also discussed to have a slight effect on the catalytic activity, i.e., lower activation barriers 
for reactions in zeolites with larger pore size.124 
4.3 Single atom catalysts  
Earlier calculations suggested initial dehydrogenation of alkanes in general requires a 
smaller ensemble of active metal centers, i.e. on top of a single atom, than deep 
dehydrogenations as well as C-C bond breaking, which normally require bridge or 3-fold 
hollow sites.92 Thus, the diluted concentration of surface active metal atoms suppresses deep 
dehydrogenation as well as coke formation, and in turn increases selective towards desired

alkenes. In the extreme case, dehydrogenation reactions may be catalyzed by a active site 
that composes of only one active metal atom on a support, which maximize the efficiency of 
metal utilization.125  
Guo et al.126 reported a direct, nonoxidative process for the conversion of methane to 
ethylene, aromatics and hydrogen that is catalyzed by a single Fe atom embedded in a silica 
matrix (Fig. 18a). Compared to other forms of the Fe catalyst, e.g. Fe supported on oxides or 
substituted in zeolites, the coke formation is negligible here. Based on DFT-calculated 
energetics, the active sites was suggested to be one Fe atom coordinated by one Si from 
silica supports and two C atoms originally derived from complete dehydrogenation of 
methane.126 It further indicates that the Fe center can active CH4 to form CH3, which desorbs 
as a radical into gas phase at temperatures as high as 1200 K. A series of gas phase radical 
reactions generate the final products, including ethylene and aromatics. Two CH3 radicals 
further combine to form ethane in a strong exothermic process, and ethane undergoes 
dehydrogenation to form ethylene with a barrier of 152 kJ mol-1. The aromatics can be 
formed by transformation of cyclization of C2H3 radicals generated from ethylene with high 
barriers, e.g. benzene (Ea = 275 kJ mol-1) and naphthalene (Ea = 314 kJ mol-1). Despite of the 
aromatics being thermodynamically more stable than ethylene (Fig. 18b), the process can 
still be tuned to feature ethylene as major product by increasing the flow rate of the 
feedstock which reduces the secondary conversion from ethylene to aromatics.

Another example for a single atom catalyst is Zn2+/SiO2 system used for selective

The origin of coke formation 
The following section deals with the side reaction to the dehydrogenation process 
leading to the formation of coke. Coke may, for instance, form if carbon centers are 
completely dehydrogenated but not removed from the catalyst surface. The unwanted 
formation of carbonaceous depositions not only decreases the selectivity towards the desired 
products, but also leads to the modification of a catalyst and the reduction of the catalytic 
activity up to the complete deactivation. When discussing “coking”, one should be aware 
that the carbonaceous species can be present in different forms, which are of varying 
stability, e.g. as on-surface C atoms, as sub-surface C atoms, forming a carbidic phase, but 
also as graphene-island covering the catalyst surface (Fig. 20).128 Although this review 
intends to address the dehydrogenation of light hydrocarbons, this section will be kept more 
general and discuss the coking process in catalytic reactions that involve organic species (e.g. 
steam reforming, Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, etc). We will see in this section that the crucial 
processes for coking (or for the prevention thereof), are the reactions of the isolated C 
centers, which may arise from the dehydrogenation (and C-C scission) of hydrocarbons but 
also from CO activation as occurring in Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis. As the origin of the C 
centers is not of primary importance for the discussion of the coking process, it seems 
reasonable to extend our focus on the coking process in systems that are beyond the typical 
catalysts used for alkane activation. In the following section we will begin the discussion 
exemplarily on the relatively well studied formation of coke on Ni surface, which is the most 
widely used reforming catalysts, and show the strategies proposed to enhance the robustness 
of Ni against coking.

5.1 Coking on Ni 
Although there are other metallic reforming catalysts like Ru and Rh, which are less 
strongly prone to coking than Ni,129 Ni is one of the most common reforming catalysts, 
which is partly due to its significantly cheaper price. In order to overcome the coking 
problem of Ni catalysts, numerous theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the 
coke formation on nickel and to come up with potential strategies to avoid the unwanted 
coking process. 
5.1.1  Coke formation mechanism 
The formation of graphene-islands type coke on Ni is analogue to the growth of carbon 
nanotubes.130 This reaction has been described as a process consisting of multiple steps128,130 
starting with the decomposition of carbon containing gas phase species yielding C centers on 
the catalyst surface. These carbon centers can dissolve into the subsurface layers of Ni and 
diffuse to those facets of the catalysts that are suitable for the graphene growth. In addition 
to the subsurface diffusion of C, a transportation mechanism via an on-surface diffusion has 
also been discussed.130 Once the C centers agglomerate at the suitable facet sites, graphene-
islands can be formed and eventually deactivate the Ni catalyst by encapsulating the metal 
surface. It is known that the formation of the graphite-islands on Ni is a structural dependent

process, which requires step sites on the Ni surface.66 A detailed investigations by Abild-
Pedersen et al.130 addressing the formation of carbon nanotubes on Ni has revealed that the 
step sites on Ni surfaces are the thermodynamically most preferred adsorption sites for C 
atoms and act as the growth centers for the graphene islands. Three different mechanisms, 
which all feature similar total barriers around 140 kJ mol-1, have been identified for the 
growth of graphene type structures on Ni step site: A) the addition of C centers to the 
graphene island formed on the (111) facet of the Ni, B) the incorporation of C atoms at the 
step edge into the growing graphene island, and C) the exchange of C atoms with step edge 
Ni atoms that are attached to the edge of the graphene islands (Fig. 21).130 Note that the 
formation of the graphene island is essentially independent from the dehydrogenation steps, 
whereas the transportation of the C atoms and the growth of the graphene islands are the 
crucial molecular processes.130 In other words, the coking process discussed here also 
applies for other processes in which surface C centers may form from reactions other than 
the dehydrogenation steps, e.g. decomposition of CO or alcohols.

It has been demonstrated for graphene islands on the Ni(111) surface, unsaturated C 
atoms at the edge of a graphene island are less stable than isolated C atoms on the metal 
surface.66,128 At variance the atoms “inside” the graphene islands coordinated by 6 other C 
atoms are more stable than the isolated C.66,128 Consequently, graphene islands are only 
stable, if they reach a critical size. Depending on the model and the assumptions, this critical 
size has been estimated to be between 10 to 80 C atoms.66,128 Thus, it has been concluded 
that the formation of graphene island is a process with a high reaction-order whose 
formation is most favourable at high C coverage rates.128  
A second form of coke on Ni is the carbidic layer. In such structures, C atoms occupy 
subsurface sides. In contrast to the formation of graphene-islands, the diffusion of C atoms

to sub surface sides forming a carbidic layer is discussed to be a first-order process with an 
associated barrier estimated to be around 70 kJ mol-1.128 In other words a carbidic layer can 
also be formed at low C coverage on the surface. Also this type of coke has shown to reduce 
the catalytic activity of Ni for methane reforming: The barrier of methane activation on a 
Ni(111) surface with sub-surface C is reported to be 143 kJ mol-1, significantly higher than 
the value of 91 kJ mol-1 calculated for the analogue process on a pure close-packed Ni 
surface.131 A similar trend is also found, when comparing the methane activation on pure Ni 
surfaces with the reaction on surfaces of the Ni3C system.132  
5.1.2  Strategies against coking 
In order to explore computationally the robustness of a catalytic system against coking, 
different parameters have been proposed as a measure for the susceptibility of a system to 
coking. One of the earlier studies have proposed to consider the C adsorption energy ,134 
while a more recent study advocated the consideration the rate ratio for the oxidation of 
surface CH and C groups (rCH/rC) as well as the rate for the cleavage of carbon monoxide.132 
The idea behind the investigation of the rCH/rC can be rationalized as follows: A low rCH/rC 
ratio means that the oxidation of the carbonaceous species mainly proceeds via the 
intermediate formation of isolated C centers, which is also the main precursor for the 
formation of coke. 132 The activation barriers for the oxidation of CH and C implies that the 
close packed Ni(111) surface is more robust against the accumulation of isolated C atoms 
and thus also against coking than the stepped Ni(211) surface or the stepped (001) and flat 
(111) surfaces of the carbidic Ni3C system. It is interesting to note here that the flat Ni(111) 
seems generally less prone for the accumulation of C centers, irrespective of its origin. It has 
been shown that during the Ni-catalyzed water-gas shift reaction, less coke is expected to 
form at terrace sites of the catalyst compared to the situation at steps, as the flat surface is 
less active for the formation of C centers via CO scission.133 
Different approaches have been proposed to encounter the coking problem. It could be 
shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is 
thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol-1 or more, than the analogue process on a 
pure Ni(111) surface.134 Based on this finding, it has been proposed to alloy Ni with Au.134 A 
cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the C-C bond formation and 
enhances the C-O bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon 
monoxide.135,136 It has been discussed that the Sn atoms separates the Ni centers on the 
catalyst surface, which tend to bind C atoms, from each other. With the Ni centers being 
separated, the C atoms on the surface are separated as well, which hinders the formation of 
coke.135,136 These theoretical results are consistent with experiments which show that pure Ni

catalysts deactivate significantly faster than NiSn alloy based catalysts.135  
Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene island as 
mentioned above, additives like potassium66, sulphur66, gold66 or boron131 have been 
proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the 
step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands.66,131 
A similar strategy, by blocking the crucial sites, has been proposed to encounter the 
formation of a carbidic phase. Calculations have shown that boron prefers the same sub-
surface sites on Ni as C.137 By occupying these sites with B, the diffusion of C to these sub 
surface sites and the formation of the thermodynamically more stable carbide phase can be 
prevented.128 Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also 
has shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers,138 which may help to 
prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface.  
5.2 Coking on other metals  
Similar to Ni, experimental and DFT studies on Co have shown that coke can be 
present as graphene islands as well as in the form of a surface carbide.139 The comparison of 
adsorption properties of boron and carbon on Co surfaces reveals that both elements behave 
similarly, i.e. both elements occupy the same adsorption sites. This indicates that the 
presence of B may prevent the deposition of carbonaceous species  on Co,140 comparable to 
the case for Ni described above. This hypothesis based on theoretical consideration could be 
confirmed by experiments, which demonstrated that the promotion of a Co Fischer-Tropsch 
catalyst with boron can significantly reduce the deactivation rate, while leaving the 
selectivity and activity unaffected.140 
It is interesting to note here that also the presence of on-surface carbonaceous species 
of the formula CHx (x = 0-3) have been discussed to influence the activity of a catalyst. An 
example is the decomposition of methanol studied on Pd cluster models.141 It could be 
shown that CH3 and CH2 species formed from the C-O cleavage of methanol tend to move to 
the thermodynamically more stable near-edge sites of the cluster where they further 
dehydrogenate to CH or C.141 The calculated results are in line with experimental studies 
which indicate that the decomposition of methanol leads to the formation of carbonaceous 
species at the near-edge sites of the Pd catalyst.142 The experiments further demonstrates that 
the occupation of the near edge sites leads to a strong decrease of the C-O cleavage rate, 
while the complete dehydrogenation of methanol yielding CO is essentially unaffected.142 
This finding shows that the formation of carbonaceous species is not generally negative. In 
the above example, the on-surface C centers selectively blocks the C-O cleavage reaction 
which is for instance unwanted in methanol reforming.

A study addressing reactions over Pt clusters supported on γ-alumina has compared the 
Gibbs free energies of reaction for alkane dehydrogenation and for the undesired coke 
formation and hydrogenolysis processes.143 By considering the ∆G values, the impact of the 
alkane pressure as well as of the H2 pressure could be investigated. It has been demonstrated, 
in accordance with experimental observations, that the performance of the dehydrogenation 
process is the best, if the ratio between the H2 pressure and the alkane pressure is between 1 
and 10.143 At lower H2:alkane ratios, the formation of coke precursors via highly 
dehydrogenated carbon species is benefitted, whereas at larger H2:alkane ratios, the 
dehydrogenation of the alkane is hindered. Despite the fact that this result appears rather 
intuitive, it should be noted that underlying molecular processes are far more complex. An 
example is the destabilization of C1 C-C scission products: the formation of the C-C scission 
products induces a change in the geometry of the Pt cluster. The so formed cluster 
morphology binds relatively little hydrogen atoms, which leads, under high H2 pressure, to a 
high and thermodynamically unfavoured value for the Gibbs free energy.143 
Although we have mentioned in the beginning of this section, that Ru and Rh catalysts 
are more robust against coking than Ni, carbon depositions can also form on surfaces of such 
metals. It has for instance been reported, that Rh(111) surfaces can be used for the growth of 
graphene.86 Calculations on Ru have shown that C atoms on a Ru surface tend to occupy the 
steps sites, which are by about 100 kJ mol-1 more favoured than the terrace sites. 144 
Experiments have shown that this deactivates the highly structure sensitive CO scission, 144 a 
process that play a central role in the methanation process or the Fischer-Tropsch process.

Concluding remarks and perspectives 
With the state-of-art DFT calculations, more and more insights into the mechanistic 
aspect for heterogeneous catalytic C-H activation reactions have been gained in the last two 
decades. The most widely calculated model system, methane dehydrogenation on metal 
surfaces have covered many important transition metal catalyst as well as alloy systems. 
Although most of the calculation conducted on the relative simple slab models, these results 
still serve as important clues which successfully explain many experimental phenomena. 
Similar to many heterogeneous catalyst reactions, the dehydrogenation activity is observed 
to follow the d band rule: a surface with higher d band center tends to bind intermediates and 
transition states more strongly, in general resulting in a low dehydrogenation barrier. 
Although low dehydrogenation barrier indicates high dehydrogenation activity for a catalyst, 
too high dehydrogenation activity might result in uncontrolled deep dehydrogenation of 
hydrocarbons, where in the worst case results in undesired coke formation.

The ultimate goal for theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for particular 
chemical processes. The fast developed BEP or other linear scaling relationships connects 
transition states, which are computational expensive to be located, with simply calculated 
parameters or so called descriptors, like reaction energies or binding energies. These linear 
relationships reduce the complexity of a catalytic system from a high dimension system with 
rate constants of N elementary steps to a few, in many cases even with only one or two, 
dimensions of descriptors, which offers a powerful strategy to achieve fast screening of large 
number of new catalysts. 
The continuing improvements of computer hardware, the development of new 
functional, as well as the increasing sophistication of computational electronic structure 
software have insured the ability of a computational study to access a more complicated 
catalytic system beyond simple transition metal surfaces. Although the general trend of 
catalytic activity is not as easy to be address as for metal systems, the case studies still shield 
lights on dehydrogenation mechanisms in these systems, and more insights emerges which 
normally difficult to be explored at molecular level even by the most advanced experimental 
equipment.  
However, there are still limitations for current theoretical calculations to model a more 
realistic catalytic system. For example, there is still no perfect solution to calculate entropies 
of soft modes, including frustrated translation and rotation, for an adsorbate, which prevents 
an accurate estimation of surface thermodynamics. The above mentioned linear scaling 
relationships introduce additional errors besides the errors by DFT calculations. In addition, 
most of the linear scaling relationships have been developed at a given coverage of a single 
adsorbate. However, under reaction conditions, the catalyst surface is a complicated system 
with different types of co-adsorbates. Although advanced kinetic modeling does explicitly 
include co-adsorbates, a fast and reliable way to generate binding energies as well as 
reaction barriers with different types of co-adsorbate is still under development.  
In more complicated cases such as oxides, the react molecules can induce change of 
the structure of a catalyst, creating vacancies or oxidizing surface metal atoms, result in a 
large amount of different types of sites for elementary reactions and dramatically increase 
the computational complexibility. Moreover, many catalytic reactions have been believed to 
be catalyzed at interface of a bi-functional catalyst, which is also not easy to be well 
described by calculations. The lattice mismatch between the particle and support results in a 
shift of relative positions between sites on particle and surface. It results in different 
environment of a given sites, where make a large number of possibilities to be considered in 
a single study. Similar issue occur in case of zeolite, where the possibility to distribute Al

atoms in the framework increase rapidly with increase of Al/Si ratio. The complexibility of 
the systems mentioned above seems to beyond the ability to completely scan the potential 
energy surfaces in a large extend with DFT calculations, which limits most of the current 
studies focuses to understand one aspect of the catalyst instead of the complete picture of 
dehydrogenation. Nevertheless, it is still a long way to go for theoretical studies to generate a 
complete and accurate description of complex catalytic systems. 
In addition to the development of computational approaches, the progress of advanced 
in situ characterizations is also quite demanding that helps the identification of active sites in 
the complex catalytic systems and offers more guidelines for theoretical studies to build 
more reliable models. On the other hand, controllable synthesis via colloidal chemistry is 
also necessary which can maximize the content of the theoretical identified high active and 
selectivity sites and structures in a real catalyst.
