3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The effect of different 
regeneration atmospheres on the metal active center and the coke deposition was investigated by XRD, 
TEM, N

-physisorption, TPO, TG and Raman technologies, and the results revealed that hydrogen or nitro- 
gen regeneration resulted in little impact on the size and structure of metal active center, retaining the 
effective PtSn phase over the catalyst. Moreover, hydrogen regeneration not only removed the low dense 
components of the coke, but also altered the property of the residual coke through hydrogenation, leading 
to a higher mobility of coke, and thus a higher accessibility of the metal active centers. Whereas nitrogen 
regeneration only removed the low dense components of the coke. Although coke-burning regeneration 
caused a thorough coke removal, the catalyst subjected to repeated redox exhibited poor stability due 
to metal agglomeration, phase segregation and the resulting large Pt

1. Introduction 
1 
Due to the growing demand of propylene as an important 
2 
base chemical intermediate in the past few years, the conven- 
3 
tional production processes including steam cracking and ﬂuid 
4 
catalytic cracking are diﬃcult to fulﬁll the shortfall of propylene 
5 
supply. As a result, the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has 
6 
been extensively studied and applied as an alternative route for 
7 
producing propylene [1–8] 
. Platinum-based and chromium-based 
8 
catalysts are the most widely used in propane dehydrogenation 
9 
reaction. Compared with Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts 
10 
display higher activity and more environment-friendly property, 
11 
and thus drawing more attention. Similar to the case of Pt-based

catalysts in other paraﬃn dehydrogenation reactions, the major 
13 
issue of Pt-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is rapid 
14 
deactivation, which is caused by coke formation and metal ag- 
15 
glomeration [9–11] 
. Hence, many effort 
s have been devoted to 
16 
enhancing the catalytic stability of Pt-based catalysts, such as 
17 
improving reaction process [3,12] 
, adding promoters [4,5,9,13–15] 
, 
18 
modifying supports [6,16,17] or preparation methods [7,8,11] 
. So far, 
19 
adding Sn is the most common approach to inhibit metal sintering 
20 
and suppress coke formation, as well as to increase propylene 
21 
selectivity by forming an alloy with Pt under reaction conditions. 
22 
However, all studies indicate that the coke deposition and grad- 
23 
ual deactivation of Pt-based catalysts in propane dehydrogena- 
24 
tion is inevitable, so periodic catalyst regeneration is necessary for 
25 
achieving a suﬃcient total lifetime. To remove the coke, catalysts 
26 
are generally regenerated under oxidizing or oxychlorination con- 
27 
ditions followed by H 
2 reduction [10, 17–19] 
. Besides air or oxygen, 
28 
steam was also used as an oxidizing regeneration atmosphere [20] 
. 
29 
Nevertheless, regeneration with oxidizing conditions may not fully 
30 
restore catalytic performance, leading to an irreversible damage of 
31 
the catalyst structure and eventual loss of activity and selectivity

in consecutive cycles [10,19] 
. In our previous study, we have found 
33 
that hydrogen regeneration can effectively remove coke in methane 
34 
dehydroamromatization [21] 
. Moreover, avoiding the introduction 
35 
of oxidizing components results in simpler operation and greater 
36 
security. Therefore, in this work, we used hydrogen to regenerate 
37 
Pt-Sn/ 
γ -Al 
2 
O 
3 catalysts and performed propane dehydrogenation 
38 
reaction through consecutive reaction-regeneration cycles. Other 
39 
two different regeneration modes including nitrogen purging and 
40 
coke-burning treatment were also carried out for comparison. The 
41 
effect of regeneration modes on the coke deposition and the metal 
42 
active center was investigated by XRD, N 
2 
-physisorption, TPO, TG, 
43 
Raman and TEM technologies.

2. Experimental 
45 
2.1. Catalyst preparation 
46 
The Pt-Sn/Al 
2 
O 
3 catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation 
47 
method. Brieﬂy, a certain amount of H 
2 
PtCl 
6 and SnCl 
2 aqueous 
48 
solution were dispersed over the calcined γ -Al 
2 
O 
3 support. The 
49 
mixture was dried by rotary evaporator at 50 °C for 100 
min after 
50 
stirring well, followed by drying in an oven at 120 °C overnight. 
51 
Finally, the catalysts were calcined in the muﬄe at 550 °C for 4 
h 
52 
and then pressed into pellets with 60 
−80 mesh. The mole ratio of 
53 
Pt to Sn was controlled at 1:0, 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3, respectively, 
54 
where Pt content was ﬁxed to 2 wt%. The ﬁnal catalyst was marked 
55 
by weight percentage, which was denoted as 2Pt/Al, 2Pt-0.6Sn/Al, 
56 
2Pt-1.2Sn/Al, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al and 2Pt-3.6Sn/Al, respectively. 
57 
2.2. Characterizations 
58 
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurement was conducted 
59 
on D-MAX 2200 coupled with copper anode tube using a K 
α ra- 
60 
diation. The 2 
θ angle was scanned from 10 
° to 90 
° at a rate of 
61 
5 °/min. 
62 
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm was recorded at 77 
K 
63 
on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. The sample was de- 
64 
gassed at 250 °C for 6 
h before the measurement. The surface area 
65 
was determined by the Brunauer 
–Emmett 
–Teller (BET) method. 
66 
The pore size was calculated based on the Barrett 
–Joyner 
–Halenda 
67 
(BJH) model. 
68 
Thermo gravimetric (TG) analysis was performed at NETZSCH 
69 
STA 409 
PC Analyzer. The spent catalyst was heated in 60 
mL/min 
70 
air from room temperature to 800 
°C at a temperature ramp of 
71 
10 °C 
/min. 
72 
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of the spent cata- 
73 
lysts was carried out on a Hiden Catlab equipped with a QGA 
74 
mass spectrometer. The spent catalyst (30 
mg) was pretreated by 
75 
40 
mL/min Ar at 150 °C for 2 
h and cooled down to 40 °C before 
76 
TPO analysis. The sample was then heated from 40 to 700 °C at a 
77 
rate of 5 °C/min in a 40 
mL/min of 20 vol% O 
2 
/Ar ﬂow. The eﬄuent 
78 
was monitored by recording the intensities of m 
/ 
e 
= 
44, 28, and 18, 
79 
and the amounts of CO, CO 
2 
, and H 
2 
O were calculated accordingly. 
80 
A fragment of CO 
2 which contributed to the signal of m 
/ 
e 
= 
28 (CO) 
81 
was subtracted from the total intensity at m 
/ 
e 
= 
28 (CO) to get the 
82 
actual amount of CO. The amount of coke was given by the sum 
83 
of CO and CO 
2 
, and the H/C mole ratio is derived from the relative 
84 
amounts of H 
2 
O, CO, and CO 
2 
. 
85 
Raman analysis was conducted under ambient atmosphere on 
86 
a LabRAM HR 800 UV Laser Raman Spectroscopy with a 632.8 
nm 
87 
laser beam. Raman spectrum was recorded with an exposure time 
88 
of 20 
s and 2 accumulations. 
89 
Electron microscope analysis was taken on an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 
90 
using high-angle annular dark ﬁeld-scanning transmission electron 
91 
microscopy (HAADF-STEM) mode and high resolution transmis- 
92 
sion electron microscopy (HRTEM) mode. The fresh catalyst after 
93 
pre-reduction and passivation or the spent catalysts were rapidly 
94 
collected and dispersed in ethanol. The sample was prepared by 
95 
dropping ultrasonically dispersing ethanol suspension onto carbon- 
96 
coated copper grids for analysis. 
97 
2.3. Catalytic test 
98 
Propane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a con- 
99 
ventional ﬁxed-bed reactor. The catalyst (200 
mg) was loaded 
100 
in a quartz tube. The sample was in-situ pre-reduced under a 
101 
50 
mL/min of 10 vol% H 
2 
/N 
2 at 540 °C for 2 
h. After reduction, 
102 
the reaction gas mixture was introduced into the system. The gas 
103 
mixture was composed of C 
3 
H 
8 
, H 
2 and N 
2 with a molar ratio of 
104 
3:1:21 under ambient pressure and the gas hourly space velocity 
105 
(GHSV) was 15,0 
0 
0 
mL/(g 
cat h). The outlet gas composition was an- 
106 
alyzed by an online Agilent 7890A gas chromatography equipped 
107 
with an FID and HP-PlotAl

ponent more than six carbon (C

112 
on the catalysts was not included in the calculation of conversion 
113 
and selectivity. Thus the realistic propane conversion is slightly 
114 
higher and propylene selectivity is slightly lower than the values 
115 
given by the above equations. However, based on TG analysis, the 
116 
average coke selectivity during a running of 8 
h under our opera- 
117 
tion condition is generally no more than 1%, so the above equa- 
118 
tions are acceptable. The deactivation parameter (De) of catalysts 
119 
is calculated by the follow formula:

where X 
0 and X

respectively. 
122 
Periodic reaction-regeneration cycles were performed through 
123 
in-situ regeneration of the spent catalyst. Three different regen- 
124 
eration modes including hydrogen or nitrogen purging and coke- 
125 
burning treatment were used to recover the catalysts. For conve- 
126 
nient operation, the same regeneration temperature was chosen as 
127 
the reaction temperature to avoid the temperature mismatch. In a 
128 
typical procedure, regeneration gas, i.e., H 
2 
, N 
2 or 5 vol% O 
2 
/N 
2 
- 
129 
10 vol% H 
2 
/N 
2 (represented as Redox), was periodically introduced 
130 
at a ﬂow rate of 50 
mL/min after each reaction cycle of 8 
h. For H 
2 
131 
or N 
2 regeneration, a purging of 2 
h was employed. Whereas for 
132 
redox regeneration, the spent catalyst was oxidized at 540 °C for 
133 
1 
h under 5 vol% O 
2 
/N 
2 
, and then reduced at 540 °C for 1 
h under 
134 
10 vol% H 
2 
/N 
2 atmosphere. Both before and after oxidation treat- 
135 
ment, a N 
2 purging of short duration was required. After eleven 
136 
consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, the catalyst was 
137 
collected for further analysis, which was denoted as 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al- 
138 
H 
2 
, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N 
2 and 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox, respectively. For the 
139 
sake of contrast, the catalyst after one period of reaction (repre- 
140 
sented as 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-8 
h) and after one reaction-regeneration cy- 
141 
cle (represented as 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H 
2

143 
characterization.

145 
3.1. Optimization of preparation and reaction parameters 
146 
Before running reaction-regeneration experiment to explore 
147 
the inﬂuence of different regeneration modes on the catalytic 
148 
performance of Pt-Sn/Al 
2 
O 
3 catalysts, a suitable catalyst with high 
149 
activity, selectivity and good stability, as well as an optimal reac- 
150 
tion condition is required. Thus a series of preparation and reaction 
151 
conditions were examined, including the ratio of Pt to Sn, calci- 
152 
nation temperature, pre-reduction temperature and the ratio of 
153 
C 
3 
H 
8 to H 
2 in feed gas. Fig. 1 demonstrates the time dependences 
154 
of propane conversion and propylene selectivity over Pt-Sn/Al 
2 
O 
3 
155 
catalysts with different Pt/Sn ratios. The detailed data concerning 
156 
other preparation and reaction conditions are not given here. 
157 
As shown in Fig. 1 
, all catalysts exhibited a gradual decrease 
158 
of propane conversion with an increase of propylene selectiv- 
159 
ity during the whole reaction course, and this trend was more 
160 
pronounced on 2Pt/Al monometallic catalyst, which exhibited the 
161 
highest initial conversion and the lowest propylene selectivity. 
162 
Compared with the monometallic catalyst, the bimetallic cata- 
163 
lysts with Sn doping showed higher selectivity and better stabil- 
164 
ity. After 8 
h of reaction, only slight decrease of propane conver- 
165 
sion over bimetallic catalysts could be observed. This indicated the

. The deactivation parameter (De, listed in Table 1 
) can 
168 
provide the quantitative result on the level of deactivation. As 
169 
Sn content rose, De value dropped. While Sn content exceeded 
170 
2.4 wt%, De value was almost unchanged. Accordingly, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al 
171 
(i.e., Pt/Sn mole ratio is 1/2) was chosen as the catalyst for periodic 
172 
reaction-regeneration operation.

3.2. Periodic reaction-regeneration test 
174 
The catalytic performances of 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al catalysts during 
175 
periodic reaction-regeneration cycles using different regeneration 
176 
modes are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2 
. In almost all the reac- 
177 
tion stage, the propylene selectivity over the catalyst regenerated 
178 
by Redox was higher than those over the catalyst regenerated by 
179 
H 
2 or N 
2 
. But the difference was very small, all selectivity was be- 
180 
yond 98%. After eleven consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration 
181 
cycles, the propane conversions over the catalysts regenerated by 
182 
H 
2 
, N 
2 and Redox decreased from about 43% to 33%, 26.9% and 
183 
12.8%, respectively, corresponding to De value of 23.5%, 37.6% and 
184 
70.3%. Obviously, the catalyst regenerated by Redox exhibited poor 
185 
stability. This is in accordance with the phenomenon that regen- 
186 
eration atmosphere containing O 
2 lead to fast deactivation of the 
187 
catalyst, reported by Pham et al. [19] 
, Sattler et al. [22] and Vu

et al. [23] 
. As expected, the catalyst using hydrogen regeneration 
189

and corresponding metal particle size distributions of the fresh and 
199 
used catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 
. For the fresh catalyst, an aver- 
200 
age particle size of about 12.7 
nm could be observed. After eleven 
201 
consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, the average par- 
202 
ticle size of the catalyst regenerated by H 
2 and N 
2 both slightly 
203 
increased to about 13.4 
nm, indicating that no signiﬁcant sinter- 
204 
ing emerged. Whereas for the catalyst regenerated by Redox, the 
205 
average particle size increased to 17.1 
nm. Although Sn doping can 
206 
inhibit metal sintering, severe conditions such as repeated redox 
207 
regeneration indeed lead to metal agglomeration, as suggested by 
208 
the previous reports [10,19] 
. 
209 
Besides the agglomeration and growing up of metal particles, 
210 
the phase transition of Pt-Sn alloy also plays an important role in 
211 
affecting catalytic performance. Previous study demonstrated that 
212 
the stability of supported Pt-Sn catalyst depends on the type of 
213 
Pt-Sn alloy, where PtSn phase is more effective than Pt 
3 
Sn phase 
214 
for propane dehydrogenation [24] 
. So XRD and HRTEM were con- 
215 
ducted to analyze the phase transition of Pt-Sn alloy.

241 
is most likely related to lack of long range order for PtSn al- 242 
loy, which was formed by gradual penetration of Sn into metal- 243 
lic Pt lattice to Pt/Sn ratio of 1. So the diffraction intensity of 244 
PtSn in XRD was weak, but PtSn is the main alloy phase over 245

Additionally, a core-shell structure originated form phase segrega- 
251 
tion could be clearly observed on 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox. The distin- 
252 
guishable lattice spacing of 0.208 or 0.187 
nm in the shell region 
253 
ascribed to Sn (2 2 0) or (3 1 0) suggests that metal Sn possibly 
254 
constituted the shell. This Sn encapsulation inhibited the dehydro- 
255 
genation activity of the core-shell structure. Vázquez-Zavala et al. 
256 
[25] reported similar core-shell structure of metal particles over 
257 
supported Pt-Sn catalysts, where Sn, PtSn 
2 or PtSn 
4 constituted the 
258 
Sn-rich surface. 
259 
Based on the results of HAADF-STEM, XRD and HRTEM, it can 
260 
be suggested that using H 
2 or N 
2 regeneration resulted in little 
261 
impact on the size and structure of metal active center, retaining 
262 
the effective PtSn phase. Whereas using Redox regeneration led to 
263 
metal agglomeration and phase segregation, forming large Pt 
3 
Sn 
264 
particle and core-shell structure with a Sn-rich surface. These ob- 
265 
servations on metal active center can explain why the catalyst re- 
266 
generated by Redox displayed poor catalytic performance, but no 
267 
remarkable difference concerning metal center could be found be- 
268 
tween H 
2 and N 
2 regeneration. Thus, coke deposition, another crit- 
269 
ical factor responsible for catalytic stability, requires investigation. 
270 
3.4. Effect of regeneration modes on the coke deposition 
271 
Table 3 lists the textural properties of the support and cata- 
272 
lysts. After loading Pt-Sn, the surface area and pore volume of 2Pt- 
273 
2.4Sn/Al-fresh decreased compared with those of Al 
2 
O 
3 support, 
274 
indicating that metal particles partially blocked the pores derived 
275 
from Al 
2 
O 
3 support. Multiple reaction-regeneration operations us- 
276 
ing H 
2 or N 
2 as regeneration atmosphere resulted in a much lower 
277 
pore volume, while 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox displayed a similar, even 
278 
slightly higher pore volume compared with the fresh catalyst. Dif- 
279 
ferent regeneration modes caused the variation of pore volume. 
280 
This can be explained by coke analysis, as shown in Table 4 
. TG 
281 
measurements suggested that about 10% coke deposited on 2Pt- 
282 
2.4Sn/Al-H 
2 or 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N 
2 
, further blocked the pores of Al 
2 
O 
3 
283 
support. While no coke could be detected on 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox, 
284 
showing that the catalyst regenerated by Redox was subjected to 285 
thorough removal of coke, and thus the pore volume restored. 
286 
2.4Sn/Al-H 
2 and 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N 
2 with the similar coke amount 287 
exhibited different performances in propane dehydrogenation, in- 288 
dicating that the amount of coke deposited on catalysts does not 289 
correlate with the loss in reactivity, as previously reported [19,21] 
. 290 
Thus, TPO measurements were conducted to further investigate the 
291 
coke deposition. Fig. 6 shows the TPO proﬁles of the spent cata- 292 
lysts, and the corresponding quantitative results are also summa- 293 
rized in Table 4 
. All coke amounts obtained from TPO are consis- 294 
tent with the TG results. The catalysts regenerated by Redox have 295 
no TPO peaks due to thorough coke burning. 
296 
For 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-8 
h, the catalyst after a reaction of 8 
h without 
297 
regeneration, one major high-temperature peak centered at about 298 
400 °C and one low-temperature shoulder around 280 °C could 299 
be observed. As well known, the relative position of TPO peaks 300 
is highly associated with the intrinsic property and the location 
301 
of the coke deposited on catalysts. The coke with high H con- 302 
tent or close to metal sites is easy to be oxidized at lower tem- 303 
peratures, while the coke with low H content or far from metal 304 
sites needs higher oxidation temperatures. In a similar system, Li 305 
et al. [26] proposed that the TPO peak locating in the interval of 306 
150 
−280 °C and 380 
−430 °C could be attributed to the combustion 307 
of coke deposited on the metal and on the support, respectively. 308 
When this catalyst was regenerated by N 
2 
, the low-temperature 309 
peak for 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N 
2 
-1 signiﬁcantly decreased, indicating that 
310 
considerable carbonaceous species adsorbed or deposited on the 
311 
metal sites was removed. It is obvious that these carbonaceous 
312 
species should be volatile and less dense, because they could be 
313 
removed by N 
2 purging. 
314 
However, H 
2 purging resulted in an additional effect, not only 
315 
light adsorbed species was removed, as demonstrated by the anal- 
316 
ogous decrease of low-temperature peak, but the property of coke 
317 
was also altered. This was conﬁrmed by the C/H ratio analysis. In 
318 
contrast to without regeneration (C/H ratio of 2.36), N 
2 purging 
319 
resulted in a higher C/H ratio of 2.56 due to the removal of less 320 
dense coke with high H content, whereas H 
2 purging resulted in a

2 purging, the resulting coke de- 
323 
position over 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H 
2

324 
showing that hydrogenation of the coke occurred. According to the 
325 
literatures reported by Li et al. [26] and Srihiranpullop et al. [27] 
, 
326 
the coke formed on the metal can be further softened to less dense 
327 
through hydrogenation. This coke with higher H content presents 
328 
higher mobility. It is most likely that the stubborn coke on or be- 
329 
side the metal sites, which has great impact on the catalytic per- 
330 
formance, would be transformed by hydrogenation to get ﬂuidity, 
331 
migrating away from the metal sites to the support or becoming 
332 
a more loose attachment to the metal sites. This transformation of 
333 
the coke could enhance the accessibility of the metal active cen- 
334 
ters and reduce the restriction of reactant adsorption and product 
335 
desorption. As a result, the catalyst regenerated by H 
2 presented 
336 
more stability. An additional evidence also reﬂects that hydrogena- 
337 
tion caused higher mobility of the coke. It could be found that a 
338 
minor TPO peak emerged at 550 °C only over the catalyst regen- 
339

341 
due to more diﬃcult diffusion of oxygen.

After multiple reaction-regeneration, the catalysts regenerated 
343 
by H 
2 and N 
2 deposited more coke, and both C/H ratios increased 344 
compared with their counterparts after one cycle of reaction- 345 
regeneration. This is because of further condensation of the coke 346 
at relatively high temperatures in long-term operation. In contrast 
347 
with 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N 
2 with a higher C/H ratio of 4.64, the hydro- 348 
genated 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H 
2 has a relatively lower C/H ratio of 3.66, 349 
and thus presenting a temperature decrease of about 10 
°C on the 350 
major coke combustion peak, as shown in Fig. 6 
(b). 
351 
Raman measurements were also conducted to explore the 
352 
structural property of coke, as shown in Fig. 7 
. For all the cata- 353 
lysts containing coke, two distinct peaks can be observed around 354 
1320 cm 
−1 (D band) and 1587 cm 
−1 (G band), generally ascribed to 
355 
the disordered graphitic lattice and ideal graphitic lattice, respec- 
356 
tively. The ratio of I 
D 
/ 
I 
G (listed in Table 4 
) is regarded as an index 
357 
for the crystalline order of graphite, or the graphitization degree of 
358 
carbon materials, i.e., higher I

I 
G ratio represents more structural 359

size of graphitic crystallites [22,28–30] 
. Obviously, more defects 
361 
and lower graphitization degree of the coke should imply higher 
362 
H content. As expected, for the catalysts after one cycle of reaction 
363 
or reaction-regeneration, the I 
D 
/

365 
accordance with the order of H content, a reverse order of C/H 
366 
ratio obtained by TPO analysis. Moreover, similar correspondence 
367 
of I 
D 
/ 
I 
G and C/H ratios can also be observed on the catalysts after 
368 
multiple reaction-regeneration. However, a seeming contradiction 
369 
arose from comparing the I 
D 
/ 
I 
G and C/H ratios on all the catalysts. 
370 
For 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H 
2 and 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N 
2 
, it seems that the I 
D 
/ 
I 
G ra- 
371 
tios should be much lower than that of 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N 
2 
-1 because 
372 
they have two relatively higher C/H ratios. One possible explana- 
373 
tion is that the I 
D 
/ 
I 
G ratio obtained from Raman spectrum mainly 
374 
reﬂects the near surface property of the coke deposited on the cat- 
375 
alyst after multiple reaction-regeneration, i.e., the coke forming in 
376 
the last one cycle maybe contributed the most to the I 
D 
/ 
I 
G 
, while 
377 
the C/H ratio obtained from TPO always reﬂects the whole prop- 
378 
erty of the coke. Nevertheless, the Raman can still provide valuable 
379 
information by comparing the catalysts subjected to similar coking 
380 
process.

382 
Propane dehydrogenation reaction over Pt-Sn/ 
γ -Al 
2 
O 
3 catalysts 
383 
was performed through consecutive reaction-regeneration cycles, 
384 
where different regeneration modes including hydrogen or nitro- 
385 
gen purging and coke-burning treatment were used to restore the 
386 
catalysts. It was found that the catalyst using hydrogen regenera- 
387 
tion showed the best stability compared with those regenerated by 
388 
nitrogen purging and coke-burning treatment, suggesting that hy- 
389 
drogen regeneration is an effective approach for maintaining the 
390 
performance of Pt-Sn/ 
γ -Al 
2 
O 
3 catalysts in propane dehydrogena- 
391 
tion reaction. The characterization results demonstrated that us- 
392 
ing hydrogen or nitrogen regeneration resulted in little impact on 
393 
the size and structure of metal active center, retaining the effec- 
394 
tive PtSn phase over the catalyst. Moreover, hydrogen regeneration 
395 
not only removed the low dense components of the coke, but also 
396 
altered the property of the residual coke through hydrogenation, 
397 
leading to a higher mobility of coke, and thus a higher accessibil- 
398 
ity of the metal active centers. Whereas nitrogen regeneration only 
399 
removed the low dense components of the coke. Although coke- 
400 
burning regeneration caused a thorough coke removal, the catalyst 
401 
subjected to repeated redox exhibited poor stability due to metal 
402 
agglomeration, phase segregation and the resulting large Pt 
3 
Sn par- 403 
ticle and core-shell structure with a Sn-rich surface.
