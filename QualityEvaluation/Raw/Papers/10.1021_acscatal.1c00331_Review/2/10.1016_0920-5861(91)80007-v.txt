Infrared

The formation

species 
for catalyst 
prepared 
by stepwise 
impregnation 
of 
alumina 
by salts 
of the two 
metals 
was not observed 
for catalysts 
prepared 
by a 
simultaneous 
impregnation 
method. Short 
range 
platinum-rhodium 
interactions 
for the latter 
may reduce 
the tendency 
for oxide 
formation 
leading 
to loss 
of 
oxidation 
activity. 
Current 
three-way 
catalysts 
in automobile 
exhaust 
systems 
for 
the 
simultaneous 
conversion 
of carbon 
monoxide, 
nitrogen 
oxides 
and 
hydrocarbons 
to 
nitrogen, 
carbon 
dioxide 
and water 
contain 
both platinum 
and 
rhodium 
metals. 
Rhodium 
is 
used 
because 
it promotes 
the low 
temperature 
reduction 
of 
NO and 
gives improved 
selectivity 
to N3, rather 
than 
NH3. 
1,2 Platinum 
is used 
for its 
contribution 
to CO and hydrocarbon 
conversions 
especially 
during 
the initial 
warm up period. 
3 However, 
rhodium 
may also improve 
low temperature 
oxidation 
performance.

a Pt/Rh 
bimetallic 
catalyst 
compared 
to a physical 
mixture 
of Pt 
and Rh monometallic 
catalysts 
in 
a temperature 
range 
characteristic 
of the warm 
-up period. This synergistic 
activity 
enhancement 
was found 
only 
for 
Pt/Rh 
catalysts 
prepared 
by stepwise 
metal impregnation, 
and 
not when the components 
were impregnated 
simultaneously. 
4 However, 
no attempt 
was 
made to relate 
differences 
in catalytic 
activity 
with differences 
in surface 
structure 
of the 
two types 
of bimetallic 
catalysts. This 
paper 
reports 
infrared 
results 
for 
CO/O2 
reaction 
at 300-573 
K over 
Pt-Rh/Al,O, 
catalysts 
prepared 
by single 
step 
and two-stage 
impregnation 
procedures. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Platinum, 
rhodium 
and platinum/rhodium 
catalysts 
made 
by single 
stage 
impregnation 
[Pt-Rh 
(SIM)] 
were prepared 
as described 
previously,

aqueous 
slurries 
of HPPtCl.6 
and/or 
Rh(N03)3 
(5.44% 
aqueous 
solution) 
with 
Degussa 
C 
Y-A1203. A platinum/rhodium 
catalyst 
prepared 
by a two-stage 
impregnation 
sequence 
[at-R~(sTEP)] 
was made 
by addition 
of rhodium 
salt 
to a PtfA1303 
sample 
which 
had been calcined 
at 673 
K in oxygen. Physical

were 
prepared 
by calcining 
discs 
of respective 
samples 
separately 
followed 
by thoroughly 
grinding 
together 
appropriate 
amounts 
of the 
two 
single

catalysts. Self-supporting 
discs 
of the impregnated 
alumina 
were heated 
in a flow 
of oxygen 
at 673 
K and then 
reduced 
in a flow of

RESULTS 
AND DISCUSSION 
Figure 
l(a) 
shows 
the 
spectrum 
of Rh/Al 
03 following 
exposure 
to oxygen 
and CO at 303 
K. Bands 
at 2096 
and 2025 
cm 
-1 due to the 
gem-dicarbonyl 
species 
6-8 
were formed 
under 
similar 
conditions 
in the 
absence 
of 0 5 
2 in 
contrast 
to bridging 
CO which 
was absent 
here 
but present 
for CO alone 
on 
Rh/A1203.5 This inhibiting 
effect 
of oxygen 
on the 
bridged 
mode of adsorption 
of CO has been 
previously 
observed 
for 
Rh/A12036-8 
and is independent 
of the 
order 
in 
which 
the 
reactant 
gases 
are admitted. 
' Oxidation 
of CO at 303 
K 
was apparent 
from 
the 
build 
up of CO2 in 
the infrared 
cell 
and by the appear- 
ante 
of bands 
at 1640, 
1480 
and 1230 
cm 
-1 
which 
are characteristic 
ate species 
on the 
alumina 
support. The extent 
of oxygen 
removal, 
apparently 
insufficient 
to allow 
the 
re-establishment 
of sites 
for 
absorption 
of 
CO in the 
bridged 
mode. A shoulder 
at 2117 
cm 
-1 was 
473 K [fig. 
l(e)]. A similar 
band 
was observed 
for CO adsorbed 
on 
samples 
which 
had been 
oxidised 
at 673 
K. 
8 Under 
these 
conditions 
of bicarbon- 
however, 
was 
the 
observed 
at 
Rh/A1203 
the catalyst 
surface 
is covered 
primarily 
by Rh203 
10 and 
hence the 
band 
is assigned 
to 
Rh3+co 
. This 
species 
was destroyed 
on heating 
between 
543 
and 553 
K [fig. 
l(i,jf]. A band 
at 2068 
cm-1 
due to linearly 
bonded 
CO was first 
observed 
in 
this 
temperature 
range 
and eventually 
became 
the 
most dominant 
species 
as bands 
due to the 
gem-dicarbonyl 
species 
diminished. No bridged 
CO was formed 
at 
these 
high temperatures. The simultaneous 
loss 
of dicarbonyl 
species 
and 
development 
of linearly 
bound 
CO 
was previously 
noted 
at temperatures 
above 
448 
K.ll This 
process 
has been described 
as reductive 
in 
nature, 
leading 
to 
the formation 
of CO2 
and the agglomeration 
of isolated 
Rh'+ ions 
into 
metal 
particles. 
11-13 In the absence 
of oxygen, 
the same 
catalyst 
underwent 
the 
same 
CO-induced 
changes 
albeit 
at a lower 
temperature 
, and resulting 
in 
a more 
dominant 
band 
due to the linear 
species. 
5 Additionally, 
since 
the 
presence 
of 
hydrogen 
enhances 
this 
agglomeration 
effect 
13 (reduces 
the temperature 
at which 
the dicarbonyl 
to linear 
carbonyl 
transition 
occurs), 
a clear 
link 
exists 
between 
reduction 
of rhodium 
and the spectroscopic 
changes 
observed. The onset

of the 
agglomeration 
process 
here 
may indicate 
the 
removal 
of oxygen 
atoms 
at 
the edges 
of rhodium 
particles 
hence 
allowing 
migration 
of isolated 
rhodium 
species 
to occur. The loss 
of Rh3+C0 
species 
occurring 
within 
the same 
tempera- 
ture 
range 
as these 
changes 
may be significant 
if this 
indicates 
a reduction 
of 
surface 
oxide 
layers 
to give 
Rho. Spectral 
changes 
for CO on Flh 
may be useful 
therefore 
in determining 
temperatures 
at which 
oxygen 
removal 
begins 
and the 
onset 
of CO oxidation 
since 
the dicarbonyl 
form is 
not thought 
to be active 
for this 
reaction. 
14 
Adsorption 
of CO on sn oxygen 
pretreated 
Pt/A1203 
sample [fig. 
2(a)] 
gave 
an equivalent 
spectrum 
to that 
obtained 
in the absence 
of oxygen, 
5 with 
both 
linear 
and 
bridge-bonded 
CO apparent. However, 
the 
position 
of the 
band due to 
linearly 
adsorbed 
CO was consistently 
higher (2082 
cm 
-1 at 303 
K) in the 
presence 
of oxygen 
in accordance 
with the 
shift 
expected 
for compression 
of the 
CO adlayer. 
15,16 A second 
type of linearly 
adsorbed 
CO on 
platinum, 
possibly 
indicating 
the 
presence 
of close-packed 
terrace 
sites 
17 was shown 
by a shoulder 
at 2085 cm-l [fig. 
2(d)] 
as the 
main 
band 
was shifted 
to lower 
wavenumbers. A 
shoulder 
at 2125 cm 
-' [fig. 
2(d)] 
became 
the sole 
remaining 
band on heating 
between 
423 and 473 K. The removal 
of both types 
of linear 
CO and also 
bridging 
CO was accompanied 
by the formation 
of C02. The species 
giving 
a maximum 
at 
2125 
cm 
-1 was 
not reactive 
at this temperature 
and remained 
even 
after 
heating 
in the 
gaseous 
mixture 
at 573 
K [fig. 
2(g)] 
or following 
evacuation 
at the same 
temperature 
[fig.

band 
at 2125 
cm 
-1 has been 
previously 
assigned 
to Pt(CO)O18 
or to a carbonyl 
group 
adsorbed 
on a Pt 
2+ i0n.l' The 
high stability 
of the 
present 
species

with the 
adsorbent 
platinum 
was incorporated 
into, 
rather 
than 
chemisorbed 
on, 
the 
platinum 
20 thus 
providing 
evidence 
for CO adsorption 
at exposed 
Pt2+ ions. 
Correlation 
between 
the 
appearance 
of a similar 
infrared 
band 
and 
an XPS 
signal 
21 for 
Pt2+ would 
support 
this conclusion. 
The stepwise 
impregnated 
Pt-Rh catalyst 
gave a spectrum 
similar 
to that for 
rhodium 
alone 
following 
02/C0 
adsorption 
with bands 
due to the 
gem-dicarbonyl 
(2096, 
2025 
cm-') 
being 
the most 
dominant 
features 
[fig. 
B(a)]. However 
a 
maxims at 1840 
cm 
-1 due to bridged 
CO was present 
here 
but absent 
for 
rhodium 
and is 
most likely 
due to CO on exposed 
Pt atoms, 
although 
mixed 
bridging 
sites 
for 
Pt-Rh 
catalysts 
have been 
proposed. 
22 Additionally, 
a shoulder 
at 2073 
cm 
was observed 
at a contact 
temperature 
of 323 
K [fig. 
3(b)]. The shoulder 
became 
a resolved 
maximum 
as the temperature 
was increased, 
finally 
giving 
a peak at 
2063 
cm 
-1 at 423 K [fig. 
3(d)], 
and is 
assigned 
to P&CO. 
CO2 concentration 
increased 
at this 
temperature 
and reached 
its 
maximum 
level 
at 473 K [fig. 
3(e)]. This 
correlated 
with the temperature 
at which linear 
and 
bridged 
forms 
of adsorbed 
CO were 
removed 
leaving 
a spectrum 
with 
bands 
due to the 
gem- 
-1 
dicarbonyl 
species 
and a band 
at 2125 cm . 
The dicarbonyl 
maxima 
were 
pro- 
gressively 
diminished 
on further 
increasing 
the contact 
temperature, 
however, 
in contrast 
with 
results 
for rhodium 
catalysts 
in the absence 
of platinum, 
no 
corresponding 
development 
of Rh-CO 
occurred. The dicarbonyl 
maxima 
were 
absent 
by 548 
K leaving 
a band at 2125 cm-l [fig. 
3(j)]. Since 
the 
equivalent 
maims 
for 
Rh/A1203 
was absent 
at this 
temperature 
and above, 
the band is unlikely 
to 
279 
be due to Rh3+C0 
and is assigned 
to Pt*+CO. At temperatures 
of 523 
K and 
above, 
a weak 
broad 
maximum 
at ca. 1900 
cm 
-1 
- 
due to bridged 
CO was apparent 
and 
grew 
in intensity 
with increasing 
temperature. 
As sequential 
impregnation 
of metal 
salts 
may lead 
to segregated 
metal 
phases, 
23 the 
experiment 
was repeated 
using 
a physical 
mixture 
of 
Pt/Al,O, 
and Rh/A1203. The spectra 
for catalyst 
at 300-373 
K were similar 
to those 
for 
the Pt-Rh(STEP) 
catalyst 
with 
bands 
due to bridged 
CO (1845 
cm-') 
and 
Rh 
dicaxbonyl 
(2096, 
2023 cm-') 
species 
after 
treatment 
at 303 
K [fig. 
4(a)] 
and 
also 
Pt-CO (2076 
cm-') 
at 373 
K [fig. 
4(c)]. The bridged 
and Pt-CO 
species 
were 
absent after 
heating 
at 423 
K [fig. 
4(d)], 
and by 473 
K [fig. 
4(f)] 
the 
spectrum 
was almost 
identical 
to that of the Pt-Rh(STEP) 
catalyst 
at the 
same 
temperature with the 2125 
cm 
-1 band 
being 
resolved 
from 
the 
vs(CO) 
band of the 
dicarbonyl. In further 
agreement, 
bands 
due to the 
gem-dicarbonyl 
species 
were 
progressively 
diminished 
as a function 
of temperature 
without 
simultaneous 
-1 
development 
of a Rh-CO 
species. The 2125 
cm 
band 
was present 
at 573 
K and 
as for the 
Pt-Rh(STEP) 
catalyst 
is 
assigned 
to Pt*+CO. Further 
similarity 
to 
the 
result 
for 
Pt-Rh(STEP) 
catalyst 
was shown 
by the development 
at higher 
temperatures 
of a weak 
maximum 
at 
~a. 1900 
cm 
-1 due to bridged 
CO. 
The spectrum 
of the catalyst 
prepared 
by simultaneous 
salt impregnation 
and then 
exposed 
to 02 and CO was again 
similar 
to the 
result 
for the 
Pt-Rh 
(STEP) 
catalyst 
with 
bands due to rhodium 
gem-dicarbonyl 
(2096, 
2025 
cm-l) 
and 
platinum 
bridged 
species (1845 
cm-') 
at 303 
K [fig. 
5(a)]. At higher 
tempera- 
tures, 
the Pt-CO 
band 
became 
resolved 
leading 
to a maximum 
at 2065 
cm 
-1 at 
423 
K [fig. 
5(d)], 
and a high wavenumber 
shoulder 
appeared 
on the 
vSfCO) 
band 
of the 
gem-dicarbonyl. An increase 
in CO2 concentration 
occurred 
at this 
temperature 
and reached 
a maximum 
in 
spectra 
recorded 
with catalyst 
at 473 
K 
[fig. 
5(e)], 
correlating 
with the elimination 
of bridged 
and linearly 
adsorbed 
forms 
of CO. Although 
spectra 
of catalyst 
at 473 K bear 
resemblance 
to those 
for 
the STEP catalysts 
with bands 
due to 
rhodium 
gem-dicarbonyl 
and a maximum 
-1 
at 2125 
cm , spectra 
recorded 
above 
this 
temperature 
were significantly 
different. A band 
at 2068 
cm 
-1 appeared 
at a contact 
temperature 
of 498 
K, and 
its 
growth 
with temperature 
was apparently 
at the expense 
of bands 
due to the 
gem-dicarbonyl. This transformation 
was similar 
but occurred 
at ca. 50 
K lower 
- 
temperature 
[fig. 
5(f)] 
than that 
observed 
for 
rhodium 
catalysts 
in 
the 
absence 
of Pt [fig. 
11. Additionally, 
the 
maximum 
at 2125 
cm 
-1 was almost 
absent 
following 
heat treatment 
at 533 
K. The complete 
absence 
of this 
maximum 
at 
573 
K strongly 
suggests 
that this 
band 
was due to Rh 
3+co. 
The rhodium-type 
carbonyl 
spectrum 
of the 
Pt-Rh(SIM) 
catalyst 
is in 
contrast 
to the 
platinum-like 
carbonyl 
spectrum 
of either 
the

or the

Pt-Rh(SIM) 
catalyst 
is of importance. Several 
authors 
have 
reported 
that 
such 
a species 
is 
not active 
in the CO oxidation 
reaction 
19,24,25 
confirming 
that 
only 
chemisorbed 
atomic 
oxygen (and 
not incorporated 
oxygen 
which 
is formed 
in 
parallel 
to Pt2+ 
surface 
sites) 
is the 
active 
species. 
20 The deactivation 
of 
platinum 
catalysts 
has been attributed 
to a build 
up of 
non-reactive 
oxygen. 
26 
The absence 
of Pt2+C0 
and 
non-reactive 
oxygen 
species 
and the 
enhanced 
removal 
of oxygen 
from 
the 
Pt-Rh (SIM) 
catalyst 
would 
suggest 
that 
it should 
be a more 
efficient 
catalyst 
than 
supported 
Pt or 
Rh alone 
under 
these 
conditions 
indi- 
cating 
the 
beneficial 
nature 
of short-range 
surface 
interactions 
between 
platinum 
and 
rhodium. These 
interactions 
may involve 
rhodium 
as an oxygen 
source 
and platinum 
as the CO source 
at short 
range. 
4 
Stepwise 
impregnation 
leads 
to a catalyst 
containing 
segregated 
metal 
phases 
and produces 
spectra 
similar 
to those 
for physical 
mixtures 
of Pt/A1203 
and 
Rh/A1203. For both 
Pt-Rh(STKP) 
catalysts 
and 
physically 
mixed 
catalysts 
the 
distances 
are too 
great 
to allow 
beneficial 
synergistic 
behaviour 
to occur. 
This 
leads 
to the formation 
of inactive 
oxygen 
surface 
species. To investigate 
this 
proposal 
further, 
Pt-Rh (SIM) 
catalysts 
were calcined 
at 873 
K before 
reduction 
and exposure 
to 02/C0 
mixtures. At this 
calcination 
temperature, 
volatile 
platinum 
oxychloride 
species 
may be formed 
leading 
to enhancements 
in 
281 
platinum 
dispersion.27 Figure 
6(a) 
shows 
the 
spectrum 
following 
02/C0 
adsorption 
at 303 
K. The spectrum 
shows 
agreement 
with the 
results 
for other 
Pt-Rh 
samples 
at this 
temperature 
with dominant 
infrared 
bends 
due to rhodium 
gem-dicarbonyl 
(2096, 
2025 
cm-') 
and platinum 
bridged 
CO species 
(1840 
cm-l). 
The linear 
Pt-CO 
species 
was apparent 
as a shoulder 
(2068 
cm'*) 
at 323 
K, 
finally 
becoming 
a resolved 
maximum 
at 2061 
cm 
-' by 423 K [fig. 
6 (b)-(d)]. 
Linear 
and bridged 
carbonyl 
species 
were 
absent 
after 
heating 
to 448 
K which 
left 
the rhodium 
gem-dicarbonyl 
and 
a shoulder 
at 2120 cm 
-' [fig. 
6(e)]. 
Further 
heating 
resulted 
in a decrease 
in intensities 
of the 
dicarbonyl 
maxima 
without 
corresponding 
development 
of a linear 
RhCO 
species. The dicarbonyl 
maxima 
were 
absent 
at 553 
K leaving 
a single 
rn~irn~ 
at 2125 
cm 
-' [fig. 
6(h)]. 
The stability 
of this 
species 
would indicate 
that 
the 
band is due to Pt2+C0 
and 
not Rh3+C0 
as it 
remained 
after 
heating 
at 573 
K [fig. 
6(m)]. A weak 
maximum 
at 1690 
cm 
-1 appeared 
above 643 
K indicating 
the 
reformation 
of bridging 
CO 
species. 
The differences 
observed 
for the 
Pt-~(SI~) catalyst 
following 
oxygen 
treatment 
at two distinct 
temperatures 
would 
be consistent 
with 
the opinion 
that 
mobile 
Pt(IV)OxCly 
may be formed 
at the 
higher 
of the two temperatures 
27 
leading 
to platinum 
particles 
which 
were 
highly 
dispersed, 
and 
at sufficient 
distance from 
central 
rhodium 
particles 
to prevent 
short 
range 
interactions 
(as in STEP catalyst). These 
highly 
dispersed 
isolated 
platinum 
particles 
favour 
the formation 
of inactive 
oxygen 
species 
25 and 
hence 
the formation 
of 
Pt*+CO 
species. Increases 
in dispersion 
did 
not lead 
to enhanced 
activity 
of 
Pt-Rh 
catalysts 
for 
CO oxidation. 
28 Changes 
in oxidation state (or 
accompany- 
ing 
morphological 
changes) 
may have 
a greater 
influence 
on oxidation 
perform- 
ance.28 
Inhibition 
of the formation 
of 
non-active'oxygen 
species 
during 
CO/O2 
reaction 
may 
prevent 
loss 
of catalytic 
activity. Short 
range 
surface 
inter- 
actions 
between 
platinum 
and rhodium 
in catalysts 
prepared 
by single 
step 
impregnation 
may prevent 
the formation 
of such 
species 
and 
hence lead 
to 
improved 
performance 
under certain 
conditions 
with resulting 
reduction 
in light- 
off temperatures 
for Pt-Rh 
catalysts 
compared 
to Pt.
