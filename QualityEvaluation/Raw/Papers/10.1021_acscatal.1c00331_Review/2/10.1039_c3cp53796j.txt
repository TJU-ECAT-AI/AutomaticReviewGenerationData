Subnanometer-sized Pt/Sn alloy cluster catalysts for
the dehydrogenation of linear alkanes
Andreas W. Hauser,*a Joseph Gomes,a Michal Bajdich,a Martin Head-Gordon*b and
Alexis T. Bell*a
The reaction pathways for the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and butane, over Pt are analyzed
using density functional theory (DFT). Pt nanoparticles are represented by a tetrahedral Pt4 cluster. The
objectives of this work were to establish which step is rate limiting and which one controls the
selectivity for forming alkenes as opposed to causing further dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes to
produce precursors responsible for catalyst deactivation due to coking. Further objectives of this work
are to identify the role of adsorbed hydrogen, derived from H2 fed together with the alkane, on the
reaction pathway, and the role of replacing one of the four Pt atoms by a Sn atom. A comparison of
Gibbs free energies shows that in all cases the rate-determining step is cleavage of a C–H bond upon
alkane adsorption. The selectivity to alkene formation versus precursors to coking is dictated by the rela-
tive magnitudes of the activation energies for alkene desorption and dehydrogenation of the adsorbed
alkene. The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to
dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. Substitution of a Sn atom in the cluster to produce a Pt3Sn
cluster leads to a downward shift of the potential energy surface for the reaction and causes an
increase of the activity of the catalyst as suggested by recent experiments due to the lower net activa-
tion barrier for the rate limiting step. However, the introduction of Sn does not alter the relative activa-
tion barriers for gas-phase alkene formation versus loss of hydrogen from the adsorbed alkene, the
process leading to the formation of coke precursors.
1. Introduction
Ethene, propene, and butene are building blocks for a wide
array of commodity and specialty chemicals. While traditionally
produced by the steam cracking of petroleum-derived naptha,
the production of these light alkenes via thermal dehydrogena-
tion of C2–C4 alkanes present in natural gas and other sources
is an attractive alternative since it minimizes the formation of
methane and coke as byproducts. Platinum, in the form of
supported nanoparticles, is one of the most suitable catalysts
for the thermal dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The high
activity of Pt is a consequence of its high density of electronic
states close to the Fermi level,1–3 a characteristic that contri-
butes to C–H bond activation.4 However, unpromoted Pt cata-
lysts suffer from two drawbacks – the first is low alkene
selectivity and the second is rapid deactivation due to coking.
Both of these characteristics are a consequence of alkene
re-adsorption, which leads to further dehydrogenation and
C–C bond breaking.5,6
A number of authors have shown that superior catalyst
activity, selectivity, and stability can be achieved by alloying
Pt with Sn and by adding hydrogen to the alkane feed.5,7–11
Both aspects have been addressed in recent experiments of
our group on the dehydrogenation of ethane over PtxSn100x
clusters (70 r x r 100).12 First, it has been observed that the
presence of hydrogen suppresses the formation of coke and
enhances the rate of alkane dehydrogenation, if the ratio of H2
to alkane is below about 1.5. The mechanism behind this
improvement is poorly understood. For higher H2/alkane ratios
the rate of alkene formation decreases due to its hydrogena-
tion. Second, it has been shown that the addition of Sn
promotes the catalytic activity and selectivity towards ethene
versus the formation of methane and coke. In the past, these
improvements have been attributed to both geometric as well
as electronic effects.13–19 Tin atoms on the surface of Pt clusters
are known to frustrate the formation of larger active ensembles,
which suppresses undesired C–C bond cleavage processes that
lead to coke formation and deactivation.9,20–27 Careful comparison

of catalyst activities at varying residence times reveals an
intrinsically higher activity of the alloy compared to pure Pt
clusters,12 indicating the presence of beneficial electronic
effects as suggested by theoretical work on metal surfaces.16,17
More recent computational studies on bulk catalysts predict
PtSn surfaces to be less active but more selective: the presence
of tin reduces the adsorption energies for propane on PtSn
surfaces, but it also lowers the desorption barrier for propene,
while it simultaneously increases the barrier for propene
dehydrogenation.28,29
The aim of the present study was to obtain additional
insights into the factors governing the energetics of C–H
cleavage processes over Pt nanoparticles. To this end, we have
carried out a computational study on a drastically reduced
prototype of an active site, in order to focus on two issues:
(1) the influence of hydrogen gas on the dehydrogenation of
light alkanes and (2) the effects of partial replacement of Pt by
Sn. Our model consists of four Pt metal atoms in tetrahedral
geometry. This minimum system was chosen because it has a
well defined geometry (in contrast to larger clusters with
numerous isomers of almost identical energies), is representa-
tive of undercoordination occurring in small Pt-clusters, and is
computationally accessible due to its simplicity. This makes it a
highly suitable model for an analysis of electronic modifica-
tions without being biased by geometry effects. Another feature
of our Pt4 model is that the replacement of a single Pt atom by
Sn leads to the correct stoichiometric ratio of a typical Pt–Sn
alloy, allowing us a direct study of electronic effects on the
reaction path. While the size of the cluster used in this work is
smaller than that of Pt nanoparticles used in most experi-
mental work (1–4 nm), there have been recent reports of alkane
dehydrogenation on size-selected Pt clusters consisting of 8 to
10 atoms, stabilized on high-surface-area supports.30 Experi-
mental studies of unsupported clusters containing up to 24 Pt
atoms have also been reported for the activation of methane.31
Among the smallest clusters, particular attention has been paid
to Pt tetramers and methane dehydrogenation.32,33
2. Computational methods
Platinum nanoparticles are represented by four atoms in a
tetrahedral geometry with triplet spin multiplicity. Previous
studies have shown this structure and spin state to be the most
stable for Pt4 isomers.34–36 The activation of ethane, propane
and butane on Pt4 is investigated by means of density func-
tional theory (DFT), using the B3LYP functional37–40 together
with the standard split-valence 6-31G** basis set41 for H, C and
O and the LANL2DZ basis set/effective core potential42,43 for Pt
and Sn atoms. Cartesian d functions are used in all calcula-
tions. Details of the SCF convergence and the geometry opti-
mization thresholds are given elsewhere.44 The lowest state of
the singlet spin manifold shows a square-planar geometry,
lying 0.28 eV above the tetrahedral triplet configuration. The
lowest energy configuration for Pt3Sn is also found to be tetra-
hedral, but has singlet multiplicity. All minima and intermedi-
ates are obtained in fully unrestrained geometry optimizations.
Transition states are estimated with the freezing string method45
and
localized
by
an
eigenvector-following
approach46
in
Q-Chem.47 Gibbs free energies are calculated within the harmo-
nic oscillator approach at all relevant minima and transition
states on the electronic potential energy surface, including zero-
point energy corrections. All translational, rotational and vibra-
tional degrees of freedom are taken into consideration. To
benchmark the quality of our thermochemistry results for the
chosen computational approach we calculate the reaction
enthalpy at standard conditions for the dehydrogenation of
propane and obtain a value of 22.7 kcal mol1, which is in
reasonable agreement with the experimentally measured value
of 20.1 kcal mol1.48,49
We note that the computational method and basis set size
were chosen to allow for a rapid and eﬃcient exploration of the
potential energy surface of all alkanes considered here, but can
only be expected to give qualitative results and useful indica-
tions of trends. Although the system size would in principle
allow for larger basis sets and alternative approaches such as
RI-MP2, any gain in computational accuracy has to be mea-
sured against the severe simplifications which are intrinsic in
the model of a free-standing Pt4 cluster: energy shifts due to
distortions of the catalyst geometry and due to changes in the
electronic structure, which inevitably occur as soon as the
clusters are deposited on any type of substrate, and the uncer-
tainties introduced by particle size distributions are at least of
the same order of magnitude as errors introduced by a lack of
correlation energy or a finite basis set. A series of benchmark
calculations presented in ref. 30 indicates minor deviations of
about 0.1 eV in electronic energies with respect to the eﬀects of
cluster size and nanoparticle support.
3. Results and discussion
The reaction path and the cluster geometries for the dehydro-
genation of propane are given in Fig. 1. The corresponding
energies are summarized in Table 1 and compared to energies
for ethane and butane activation. The general outline of the
reaction path is the same for all three molecules: after physi-
sorption50 to the cluster in step A1, the alkane undergoes C–H
bond cleavage via the transition state A2, in which one hydro-
gen atom is taken from the beta carbon atom. This leads to an
intermediate state A3 with an H atom and a 2-propyl group
attached to the same corner of the cluster. The hydrogen atom
then migrates via the transition state A4 to a different corner of
the cluster, forming the intermediate A5. Removal of a second
hydrogen atom occurs, as shown in Fig. 1, via transition state
A6, which involves the cleavage of a C–H bond associated with
the alpha carbon of the 2-propyl group. While the energies of
the first five steps of the propane dehydrogenation process agree
with those reported previously to within about 0.1 kcal mol1,30
our calculations indicated a different, more direct route for the
cleavage of the second hydrogen atom via transition state A6.
The barrier for C–H bond breaking is slightly lower for a
hydrogen migration along the same edge of the tetrahedron
than it is along other edges. We obtain an intermediate state A7

with one H atom and the remaining alkene coordinated to the
same corner and the previous H atom at a different corner. After
another hydrogen migration via state A8, the minimum energy
geometry A9 is reached in which both hydrogen atoms are
attached to the same corner of the cluster. Removal of a third
hydrogen atom via the transition state A10 competes with the
desorption of a propene molecule. The desorption energy for
propene is given as red dashed line in Fig. 1, and is only 0.19 eV
above transition state A10 which must be overcome for further
dehydrogenation. The desorption of a C3H7 propyl radical is not
shown since this process requires a significantly higher energy
input of about 2 eV.
As can be seen from Fig. 1 the first C–H cleavage at A2
constitutes the rate-determining step. This process has a bar-
rier height of only 0.05 eV, which is significantly lower than the
barrier (0.70 eV) calculated for propane dehydrogenation on
bulk Pt (111).28 This indicates a strong dependence of the
activity on the local geometry of the active site. Our propane
adsorption energy of 0.29 eV, on the other hand, is close to
the experimental value measured for Pt (111), which lies
between 0.35 and 0.44 eV.51–53 A slightly weaker physisorp-
tion on the cluster is plausible given the reduced number of Pt
neighbors in the tetrahedral model for attractive van der Waals
interaction.
Having identified the potential energy changes occurring dur-
ing the dehydrogenation, we next determine changes in Gibbs
free energies. The information needed to calculate the zero-point
energy correction, the entropy and enthalpy, was obtained from
frequency calculations at the relevant geometries within the
harmonic oscillator approach. Steps related to hydrogen migra-
tion on the metal cluster yield no new chemical insights and were
skipped for brevity. Repeating this procedure for ethane and
butane we obtain a set of condensed reaction pathways shown
in Fig. 2. The first row in each plot refers directly to the relative
(and purely electronic) ab initio energy in kcal mol1 as obtained
from density functional theory (T = 0 K, p = 0 bar), while the
second contains the Gibbs free energies at 400 1C and 1 bar,
corresponding to the low-temperature side of the typical experi-
mental range for the dehydrogenation of alkanes over platinum
catalysts.7,30,54–56 It can be seen that the thermodynamic correc-
tions raise the barriers for the C–H cleavage steps. At higher
temperature, all three steps of hydrogen removal (A2, A6 and A10)
lie above the Gibbs free energy for gas-phase propane, but the first
C–H bond breaking remains the rate-limiting step. The gain in
entropy for desorption at higher temperature leads to an inversion
of the ordering at A10: the desorption of the alkenes becomes
more favorable than the third C–H cleavage step, which explains
the desired and experimentally observed high selectivity towards
alkene formation.
3.1.
The influence of hydrogen adsorption
We next consider the influence of adsorbed hydrogen on the
reaction pathway. This eﬀort is motivated by recent experi-
mental work of our group, which show a maximum ethene
formation rate at a hydrogen to ethane ratio of 3 : 2 in the gas
feed.12 For higher ratios of hydrogen gas the conversion rate
drops and converges to the equilibrium value for the reaction
C2H6 " C2H4 + H2 dictated by thermodynamics. The presence
of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous,5 and has been
mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation.

However, even at very low residence times, where the re-adsorption
of alkenes is minimized, co-feeding hydrogen gas promotes the
activity of the catalyst. This suggests a beneficial electronic eﬀect
related to a partial coverage of the catalyst with hydrogen.
As a first step in analyzing the eﬀects of hydrogen coverage
on the dehydrogenation of alkanes we determined the thermo-
dynamics of hydrogen adsorption on Pt4 clusters as a function
of the H2 pressure and the temperature. This is most easily
done by the construction of a ( p,T)-phase diagram for Pt4Hn on
the basis of the potential o which we define as
o(T,mH,n) = DEF,corr  TsPt4Hn  mHn.
(1)
Assuming a constant number N of Pt4 clusters but arbitrary
amounts of hydrogen molecules in the system, we write o(T,mH,n),
the grand potential O divided by N, as a function of the temperature
T, the chemical potential of hydrogen mH, and the number of
adsorbed hydrogen atoms n. The Pt4 clusters are treated as immo-
bilized on a surface which is coupled to a heat bath of temperature
T and an infinite reservoir of H2 gas at pressure p. Given this
idealized setup, o(T,mH,n) will be a minimum at thermodynamic
equilibrium. With a pressure dependence entering via mH(p,T) we
can now predict which value of n minimizes o for a specified
temperature and H2 pressure by simply evaluating the right hand
side of eqn (1):
The first term in eqn (1), DEF,corr, corresponds to the zero-
point-energy corrected formation energy of Pt4Hn defined as
DEF,corr = EPt4Hn  EPt4  n/2EH2 + Ecorr.
(2)
EPt4Hn and EPt4 denote the DFT energies of the hydrogen-covered
and pure cluster, respectively, and EH2 is the DFT energy of
molecular hydrogen. The temperature-independent zero-point
energy corrections have been absorbed into the term Ecorr.
The uncorrected formation energies obtained with the B3LYP
functional are listed in Table 2 and plotted in Fig. 3a. They show
an almost linear dependence on the particle number, indicating a
stepwise loading of the cluster without hydrogen interaction eﬀects.
The second term on the right hand side of eqn (1) corrects
the energy with respect to the entropy sPt4Hn of the cluster.
Assuming the platinum clusters to be immobile only vibra-
tional motion and electronic degrees of freedom can contribute
to the cluster entropy. Vibrational entropies are taken from the
thermochemistry output of Q-Chem for temperatures from 0 to
1000 1C, and are based on the harmonic oscillator approxi-
mation. The electronic contribution to entropy is calculated
from the spin multiplicities m in Table 2 via the formula selec =
R ln(m). Following the estimation of ref. 57 we neglect minimal
contributions from electronically excited states.
The third and last term on the right side of eqn (1) is the
chemical potential mH of hydrogen multiplied by the number n
of adsorbates. This last term needs special care since it intro-
duces the pressure dependence and is of the same magnitude
as DEF,corr. For the estimation of mH we follow the approach
used by previous authors in studies of cluster oxidation, and
write the chemical potential of molecular hydrogen as57–59

The change of enthalpy is given by DhH2 = h( p0,T) 
h( p0,T = 0 K). For maximum accuracy we take the values for
hH2 and sH2 from the NIST database.60 Assuming a chemical
equilibrium in the reaction
n/2H2(g) + Pt4 " P4Hn
(4)
the chemical potential for hydrogen mH is equal to mH2/2.
Having defined all terms of eqn (1) we can calculate o( p,T,n)
for the experimentally relevant range of T = 0 to 1000 1C and
p = 1 to 1010 bar and determine the phase of lowest energy for
each variable pair ( p,T). The resulting phase diagram is given in
Fig. 3c. The temperature dependence of o is illustrated in
Fig. 3b for a pressure of 103 bar. The position of the phase
transitions for this particular pressure can be derived from the
convex minimum-energy hull of the Pt4Hn curves. Surprisingly,
only four phases are to be expected in the given range, with a
notably sharp transition from a single-atom coverage to an
almost complete saturation of the tetrahedral model system.
The Pt4H phase is stable over a wide range of pressure and
temperature. Before discussing the consequence of this result
in the context of alkane activation we give a brief estimation of
the uncertainty which is intrinsic to this approximate bottom-
up approach based on electronic structure theory.
The largest uncertainty is introduced by the formation
energies obtained from density functional theory. Benchmark
calculations with diﬀerent functionals indicate slight devia-
tions in the range of a few tenths of eV, translating into a
noticeable shift of phase transitions in Fig. 3b and c, but do
not lead to qualitative changes in the overall phase diagram.
Inaccuracies due to the simplified description of entropy,
assuming the same vibrational modes for surface-mounted
clusters as for gas phase clusters, and errors due to the
harmonic approximation of frequencies, are small compared
to the uncertainties in the electronic energy.
Having identified the most probable phases of Pt4Hn we can
now analyze the impact of hydrogen coverage on the dehydro-
genation process. Obviously, a total coverage with hydrogen is
undesirable as this favors the recombination of alkenes to
alkanes and deactivates the catalyst by occupying the active
sites. Hence, the only reasonable phase in our model system is
Pt4H, which also is the preferred phase at dehydrogenation
temperatures above 600 1C for a hydrogen partial pressure
below 0.1 bar. To investigate the influence of hydrogen on the
reaction pathway for dehydrogenation we put one H atom at
one of the corners of the Pt4 cluster and recalculated the Gibbs
free energies for propane dehydrogenation. Note that there are
numerous intermediates and transition states of similar energy
due to the mobility of hydrogen on the cluster. In a trial and
error approach we tried to identify the geometries that yield the
lowest energies. To analyze a trend towards higher hydrogen
coverage we repeated this procedure also for the less likely
Pt4–H2 phase. Fig. 4 compares the reaction pathways for Pt4–H
and Pt4–H2 with that for Pt4. We find that the presence of one or
two hydrogen atoms on the cluster has little effect on the
adsorption of alkanes, but raises the Gibbs free energies of
the transition states for the three C–H cleavages. Interestingly,
it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to
far greater extent than it does for the first two steps. A marginal
effect on the first two C–H cleavages combined with a signifi-
cant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small
amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the
reaction towards the formation of alkenes. The difference
between alkene desorption (dashed lines in Fig. 4) and the
energy barrier needed to be overcome for continued dehydro-
genation (the conversion of species A9 to A10) increased from
17 to 25 and 20 kcal mol1 for Pt4H and Pt4H2, respectively.
Interestingly, the shifting effect is more pronounced for single
H atom coverage than for two atoms (i.e. a full saturation of one
corner of the tetrahedron).

Subnanometer alloy catalysts: Introducing Sn
We have examined the influence of Sn on the performance of
Pt clusters on the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane and
butane, by comparing the Gibbs free energy profiles of dehydro-
genation occurring in Pt4 and Pt3Sn. Since the replacement of
one Pt atom by Sn has a negligible influence on the tetrahedral

the marginal interaction of H atoms at diﬀerent adsorption sites and the negligible influence on the cluster geometry. (b) The grand potential per platinum cluster, o,

hull of the lowest energy curves. At the given pressure one finds relevant phases with 8, 2, 1 and 0 hydrogen atoms attached. (c) Pt4Hn phase diagram as a function of
pressure and temperature. The single adsorption of hydrogen turns out to be a separating phase between full and zero coverage. The Pt4H2 phase occurs for
suﬃciently low pressures in a very narrow temperature range. The color coding is consistent in all three pictures.

structure, any diﬀerence in activity and selectivity between
these models must be purely electronic. The corresponding
reaction pathway diagrams are given in Fig. 5. Qualitatively,
they are similar to those obtained for Pt4 (see Fig. 2), but the
atomic substitution shifts all of the steps to slightly lower
energies. This eﬀect becomes more pronounced the further
the reaction proceeds, with shifts of about 1 kcal mol1 for the
physisorbed state A1, 3 kcal mol1 for the intermediate A3 and
about 5 kcal mol1 for state A9, the trend being the same for all
three alkanes. The barrier for the rate-determining step A2 is
reduced by about 2 kcal mol1 on average, suggesting that Sn
addition may enhance the rate of alkane dehydrogenation. This
beneficial eﬀect comes at the cost of a reduced selectivity since
the introduction of Sn also lowers the barrier for the undesired
third C–H cleavage.
Interestingly, the eﬀect of Sn on Pt4 clusters is the exact
opposite of what has been predicted for bulk alloy catalyst
surfaces of Pt and Sn.28 Alloying with the less reactive Sn
increases the d-bandwidth of the material and shifts the center
of the band to lower energies. A consequence of the reduced
density at the Fermi level is an overall energy increase for all
steps of the reaction pathway, making the alloy less active for
propane dehydrogenation. On the other hand, this aﬀects the
third hydrogen removal in the same way and makes it less
competitive with propene desorption, thereby improving the
selectivity of the catalyst. This discrepancy between bulk Pt and
our cluster model can be explained by a Mulliken charge
analysis of Pt4 and Pt3Sn, which reveals that the uncharged Pt
atoms in the tetrahedral Pt4 become negatively charged (1/4e)
upon replacing one of the Pt atoms with an electron-donating
Sn atom (+3/4e). The increased electron density at the active site
lowers all energies of the reaction path, while the positively
charged Sn atom becomes the avoided, inactive corner of the
catalyst. Obviously, such a distinctive local eﬀect cannot occur
on a perfect, periodic surface of a bulk Pt/Sn alloy catalyst.
What remains in the bulk is an overall, slight reduction of

electron density at the Fermi level, which shifts the reaction
path towards higher energies.
To summarize, the comparison between Pt4 and Pt3Sn
indicates that in the case of finite nanoparticles a transfer of
negative charge from the electron-donating Sn atom to the
active site of the cluster is responsible for a higher activity but
reduced selectivity of the catalyst. For propane the energetic
diﬀerence
between
further
dehydrogenation
and
alkene
desorption at 400 1C is shrinking from 17.4 (Pt4) to 15.9 (Pt3Sn)
kcal mol1, indicating only a minimal impact on the preference
towards desorption.
4. Conclusion
A theoretical analysis of the elementary processes involved in
the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and butane was
carried out with the aim of establishing what factors influence
the formation of gas-phase alkenes versus further loss of
hydrogen from adsorbed alkene leading to formation of coke
precursors. The calculations were carried out using a tetra-
hedral Pt4 cluster to represent small Pt nanoparticles dispersed
on a support. Using this model we were also able to explore the
impact of two substantial modifications on catalyst perfor-
mance: (a) the partial coverage of the catalyst with H atoms
derived from the adsorption of H2 introduced into the feed
and (b) the replacement of a single Pt atom by Sn to model the
eﬀect of alloying with Sn on the nanoscale. Both objectives are
triggered by recent experimental discoveries of positive eﬀects
on the selectivity and activity of the alkane-to-alkene conversion
of H2 addition to the feed and alloying of Pt with Sn. We draw
the following conclusions:
(1) Our studies show that for all alkanes investigated
(ethane, propane, butane) and for both Pt4 and Pt3Sn the
cleavage of the first C–H bond is the rate-determining step.
The same conclusion is reached when one or two atoms of H
are adsorbed on a Pt4 cluster (i.e., Pt4H, Pt4H2).
(2) The remarkable selectivity towards alkene production is
explained by the higher barriers for the cleavage of the third
hydrogen atom in combination with low alkene binding ener-
gies which decrease even further with increasing temperature.
At room temperature and above the desorption of the product
alkene is more likely than further C–H bond cleavage.
(3) The co-feeding of hydrogen, to reduce coking, can be
simulated with the Pt4 model. The cluster is stable upon
hydrogen adsorption, enabling investigation of the influence
of adsorbed H atoms on the reaction pathway without eﬀects
induced by changes in cluster geometry. A phase diagram based
on thermodynamic data derived from DFT calculations predicts
one stable phase, Pt4H, for H2 partial pressures and tempera-
tures typical of those used in experimental studies (below
0.1 bar and above 600 1C). This phase shows an improved
selectivity towards alkene production: the third C–H cleavage
step is shifted to higher energy, making it even less competitive
to the preferred alkene desorption. This comes at the cost of a
slightly reduced activity as the presence of hydrogen shifts all
transition states to some extent, including the rate-determining
first C–H cleavage step.
(4) Replacement of a single Pt atom by Sn does not change
the overall geometry of the model but has strong eﬀects on the
reaction pathway. Our results show substitution of a Pt atom by
an Sn atom in Pt4 to produce a tetrahedral Pt3Sn cluster adds
negative charge to the active Pt site, causing a downward shift
in the potential energy surface for the reaction. The net result of
this eﬀect is to increase the activity of the catalyst due to the
lower net activation barrier for the rate limiting step. However,
the introduction of Sn does not alter the relative activation
barriers for gas-phase alkene formation versus loss of hydrogen
from the adsorbed alkene, the process leading to the formation
of coke precursors.

50 Several adsorption scenarios are possible, but diﬀer only
minimally in energy. For propane, the physisorption of a
terminal C group is less than 0.1 kcal mol1 lower in energy
than the adsorption of the center C group. However, follow-
ing ref. 30, C–H bond breaking at a central carbon is
preferred over a terminal carbon, making this reaction
pathway the preferred one.
