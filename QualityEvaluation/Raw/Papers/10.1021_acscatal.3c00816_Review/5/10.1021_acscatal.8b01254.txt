Abstract
Ga/H-MFI was prepared by vapor-phase reaction of GaCl3 with Brønsted acid O–H groups in dehydrated H-MFI zeolite. The resulting [GaCl2]+ cations in the as-exchanged zeolite are treated in H2 at 823 K to stoichiometrically remove Cl ligands and form [GaH2]+ cations. Subsequent oxidation in O2 and characterization by IR spectroscopy and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) suggests that, for Ga/Al ratios ≤0.3, Ga3+ exists predominantly as [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs and to a lesser degree as [Ga(OH)]2+ cations at low Ga/Al ratios (∼0.1); while both species are associated with proximate cation-exchange sites, calculated free energies of formation suggest that [Ga(OH)]2+ cations are more stable on cation-exchange sites associated with NNN (next-nearest neighbor) framework Al atoms than on those associated with NNNN (next-next-nearest neighbor) framework Al atoms. Ga K-edge X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) measurements indicate that, under oxidizing conditions and for all Ga/Al ratios, all Ga species are in the +3 oxidation state and are tetrahedrally coordinated to 4 O atoms. Fourier analysis of Ga K-edge Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) data supports the conclusion that Ga3+ is present predominantly as [Ga(OH)2]+ cations (or [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs). For Ga/Al ratios ≤0.3, wavelet analysis of EXAFS data provide evidence for backscattering from nearest neighboring O atoms and from next-nearest neighboring framework Al atoms. For Ga/Al > 0.3, backscattering from next-nearest neighboring Ga atoms is also evident, characteristic of GaOx species. Upon reduction in H2, the oxidized Ga3+ species produce [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs, [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs, and [GaH]2+ cations. Computed phase diagrams indicate that the thermodynamic stability of the reduced Ga3+ species depends sensitively on temperature, Al–Al interatomic distance, and H2 and H2O partial pressures. For Ga/Al ratios ≤0.2, it is concluded that [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs and [GaH]2+ cations are the predominant species present in Ga/H-MFI reduced above 673 K in 105 Pa H2 and in the absence of water vapor.

1. Introduction
The U.S. has large reserves of shale gas, much of which contains significant fractions of ethane and propane. (1) The availability of this relatively inexpensive source of light alkanes has stimulated the chemical industry to seek ways to use this resource for the production of olefins and aromatics via dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization. (2) While Brønsted acid O–H groups in zeolites are capable of catalyzing both reactions, they also catalyze alkane and alkene cracking, thereby limiting the yields of alkenes and particularly aromatics. (3) In contrast, Ga, Zn, and Co-exchanged MFI zeolites have been found to be active and selective catalysts for the dehydrogenation and dehydrocylization of light alkanes. (4−6) To date, the most effective catalyst for the conversion of C2–C4 alkanes into olefins and aromatics has proven to be Ga/H-MFI, which is currently used in the Cyclar process. (7−9) For this reason, there has been considerable interest in understanding the nature of the Ga species present in Ga/H-MFI and understanding the role of these species in the dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization of light alkanes.
A number of studies have focused on elucidating the structure of Ga cations ion-exchanged into H-MFI and their role in promoting C3H8 dehydrocyclization. (9−19) Nevertheless, the exchange stoichiometry, chemical structure, and molecularity of Ga species in Ga/H-MFI are not fully defined, in large part because of the way in which Ga/H-MFI is typically prepared. A conventional approach to introducing Ga cations into the MFI zeolite proceeds via incipient-wetness impregnation of H-MFI or NH4-MFI with an aqueous solution of a Ga3+ salt, most commonly Ga(NO3)3, followed by calcination in O2 at elevated temperatures in order to decompose the NO3 ligands. (20,21) Ga/H-MFI prepared in this manner contains relatively little ion-exchanged Ga3+, and a large fraction of the Ga deposits on the external surfaces of the zeolite crystal as crystalline GaOx. (22) The reason for this is that hydrated Ga3+ cations undergo slow diffusion into the MFI channels due to steric and electronic repulsion, resulting in low levels of Ga3+ ion exchange. (22,23) Ion exchange between Brønsted acid O–H groups and Ga species has been observed to occur when Ga/H-MFI prepared by this means is reduced in H2 or treated with gas-phase alkanes at temperatures >700 K. (10,14) It has been proposed that cation exchange occurs via reduction of GaOx agglomerates to form volatile Ga2O monomers, which migrate into the MFI channels and react with Brønsted acid O–H groups to form Ga+ or GaHx cations. (20,22−24) It is notable that, even after H2 reduction, Ga/H-MFI is found to contain detectable amounts of crystalline GaOx. (22) As a result of the nonuniform state of Ga species (either as exchanged cations or neutral GaOx) in conventionally prepared Ga/H-MFI, elucidation of the structure of the active form of exchanged Ga cations has proven to be challenging. (25)
Attempts have been made to prepare isolated Ga cations in H-MFI by means other than wet impregnation with Ga(NO3)3. Kwak and Sachtler have synthesized Ga/H-MFI by vapor-phase reaction of Brønsted acid O–H groups with GaCl3. (15) However, these authors did not provide conclusive evidence for GaCl3 grafting, removal of residual Cl ligands, and the chemical structure of the Ga3+ cations existing in the as-prepared materials. García-Sánchez and co-workers and Rane et al. have synthesized Ga/H-MFI by grafting Ga3+ at cation-exchange positions in the zeolite via reaction of Ga(CH3)3 with Brønsted acid O–H groups. (12,26) This volatile precursor was found to react unselectively with both Brønsted acid O–H and Si–OH groups. While complete titration of Brønsted acid O−H groups in the zeolite with Ga3+ cations could be achieved (i.e., Ga/Al = 1), no attempts were made to systematically examine the effects of Ga/Al ratio on the structure of the grafted Ga3+ cations. (26)
The aim of the present work was to produce isolated Ga3+ species in Ga/H-MFI with Ga/Al ratios of 0.1 to 0.7. This objective was achieved via the reaction of Brønsted acid O–H groups in H-MFI with GaCl3 vapor. By carefully controlling synthesis parameters and employing detailed chemical and spectroscopic probes in combination with theoretical calculations, we were able to demonstrate that, in the oxidized state and for Ga/Al ratios ≤0.3, Ga/H-MFI contains predominantly isolated [Ga(OH)2]+ cations, present as [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs, and a small fraction of divalent [Ga(OH)]2+ cations. Both cationic species are associated with proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms. Experimental determination of the Ga3+ exchange stoichiometry in concert with theoretical calculations suggests that, at low Ga/Al ratios (∼0.1), [Ga(OH)]2+ cations form at proximate cation-exchange sites for which the Al–Al distances are ≤5 Å, whereas [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs form at proximate cation-exchange sites for which the framework Al atoms are farther apart. The concentration of the latter structure increases with increasing Ga content until all available proximate cation-exchange sites are saturated at a Ga/Al ratio of ∼0.3. For higher Ga/Al ratios, introduction of additional Ga results in the formation of GaOx oligomers. Upon H2 reduction of as-prepared Ga/H-MFI, both [Ga(OH)]2+ cations and [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs convert into [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs. For proximate cation-exchange sites with sufficiently short interatomic framework Al–Al distances (≤5 Å) at low Ga/Al ratios, [Ga(OH)H]+ cations may undergo condensation with proximate Brønsted acid O–H groups to form [GaH]2+ cations. Theoretically determined phase diagrams of Ga3+ hydride structures suggest that the nature of Ga3+ species formed upon H2 reduction is highly sensitive to the framework Al–Al interatomic distance in proximate cation-exchange sites and to the relative partial pressures of H2O and H2. Under sufficiently anhydrous reducing conditions (≤10–1 Pa H2O, >103 Pa H2), [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs may further reduce to [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs. At temperatures above 713 K, [GaH2]+ cations undergo a change in coordination from 4 to 3, with a reduction in the number of framework Ga–Of bonds from 2 to 1.
2. Experimental and Theoretical Methods
2.1. Synthesis of Ga/H-MFI Catalysts
The parent H-MFI sample was prepared by heating 1–2 g batches of NH4-MFI (Zeolyst, CBV 3024E) in quartz boats placed in a tubular quartz tube, at 2 K min–1 from ambient temperature to 773 K in flowing synthetic dry air (Praxair, ultra zero, 100 mL min–1). Samples were held at 773 K for 4 h to convert the NH4 form of the zeolite into the H form. The bulk Si/Al ratio of the zeolite was determined to be 16.5 ± 1.0 by ICP-OES carried out by Galbraith Laboratories (Knoxville, TN). Previous work (using Co2+ cation titration) in our group has shown that the fraction of proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms present as either next-nearest neighbor (NNN) or next-next-nearest neighbor (NNNN) is approximately 45% of the framework Al. (27)
Prior to carrying out the vapor-phase exchange with GaCl3, H-MFI was dehydrated by placing 2 g of the zeolite in a 20 mL glass ampule and heating it to 573 K in a sand bath for 3 h under dynamic vacuum using a Schlenk line. The dehydrated H-MFI was sealed and then transferred into a N2-purged glovebox. This material was intimately mixed with anhydrous GaCl3 (99.999% Strem chemicals) in a porcelain crucible inside the glovebox, to achieve Ga/Al ratios of 0.1 to 0.7. Each physical mixture was then loaded into a fresh glass ampule and taken out of the glovebox, sealed under N2. Samples were cooled by immersing in a liquid N2 bath, to prevent loss of Ga content due to evaporation of GaCl3. The ampule was then evacuated and flame-sealed under dynamic vacuum, heated in a furnace at 5 K min–1 to 478 K, and held at this temperature for 2 h before being cooled to ambient temperature. This procedure led to sublimation of GaCl3 and reaction of gas-phase GaCl3 with Brønsted acid O–H groups in the zeolite. Following the sublimation step, the contents of the ampule were transferred to quartz boats (1–2 g) and heated in a tubular quartz tube under flowing dry synthetic air (Praxair, ultra zero, 100 mL min–1) at 2 K min–1 to 773 K, held for 1 h, and then cooled to 363 K. The system was flushed with He for 5 min, and the flow was then switched to 105 Pa H2 (Praxair, 100 mL min–1). Samples were heated under H2 flow at 5 K min–1 to 823 K, held at this temperature for 2 h, and then cooled to 623 K. At this temperature, the system was flushed with pure He for 10 min after which flow was switched back to dry synthetic air (Praxair, ultra zero, 100 mL min–1). Samples were heated under flowing air at 5 K min–1 to 773 K, held for 1 h, and then cooled to ambient temperature. This procedure was required to convert grafted [GaCl2]+ to [GaH2]+ cations and to oxidize the latter species to [Ga(OH)2]+ cations. The effluent from these reduction/oxidation treatments was passed through an H2O/NaHCO3 trap in order to trap any HCl released. Ga/H-MFI samples were stored in a glovebox until further use. Chloride titration was performed on the contents of the H2O/NaHCO3 trap (attached to the outlet line from the synthesis reactor) in order to quantify the HCl released during reduction/oxidation treatments of grafted samples. These titrations were performed using Mohr’s method: NaHCO3 was added to the solution until it reached a neutral pH. The resulting solution was then titrated against Ag(NO3)3 using K2CrO4 as an indicator in order to directly estimate Cl concentrations. (28) Ga/Al ratios and Cl/Ga ratios of Ga/H-MFI samples (post reduction/oxidation treatments) were determined by ICP-OES at Galbraith Laboratories.
2.2. Chemical and Spectroscopic Characterization of Ga/H-MFI Samples
Raman spectra of Ga/H-MFI samples were acquired using a LabRam HR Horiba Jobin Yvon Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm C.W. 50 mW laser. Samples of Ga/H-MFI (∼100 mg) were loaded into an in situ Raman cell equipped with a quartz window (Linkam stage, CCR1000) and heated under flowing dry air (Praxair, extra dry, 100 mL min–1) from ambient temperatures at 5 K min–1 to 1023 K, held at this temperature for 0.5 h, and then cooled to ambient temperature. Raman spectra of β-Ga2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich) were acquired at ambient temperature. An average of three Raman scans was recorded per measurement. Raman spectra were normalized to the band at 800 cm–1 characteristic of T-O-T vibrations of the zeolite framework. (29)
Infrared spectra of H-MFI and Ga/H-MFI samples were acquired in transmission mode using a Nicolet 670 FTIR spectrometer. Samples (∼30 mg) were pressed into thin wafers and transferred into a cylindrical stainless steel sample holder. The sample and sample holder were sealed in a low dead-volume, in situ infrared cell equipped with CaF2 windows. Prior to the acquisition of spectra, all samples were heated under flowing dry synthetic air (Praxair, ultra zero, 100 mL min–1) at 2 K min–1 to 773 K, held for 0.5 h, and then cooled to 723 K. Spectra were collected at 723 K by averaging 64 scans with a resolution of 2 cm–1. In order to examine the effects of H2 treatment, calcined samples were exposed to 3% H2/He (Praxair, 75 mL min–1) at 773 K and treated for 1 h at this temperature. Samples were then cooled to 473 K for measurement. All infrared spectra were baseline corrected (using a Spline function) and normalized to the intensity of Si–O–Si framework overtone bands occurring between 1700 and 2000 cm–1. The fraction of Brønsted acid O–H groups exchanged by Ga3+ at each Ga/Al ratio was determined by integrating the area of the infrared band of Brønsted acid O–H stretching vibrations at 3593 cm–1 for each Ga/Al ratio and then normalizing this area by the area of this band in the parent H-MFI sample, as shown in the equation below.

NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) profiles of H-MFI and Ga/H-MFI samples were measured using a home-built apparatus. Samples (∼0.2 g) were placed on a quartz wool plug inside a tubular quartz reactor (∼0.6 cm sample bed height) with a thermocouple placed directly above the catalyst bed. Samples were treated under flowing dry synthetic air (Praxair, ultra zero) at a flow rate of 100 mL min–1, heated at 5 K min–1 from ambient temperature to 773 K, and held at this temperature for 0.3 h. The reactor was then cooled to 433 K upon which the flow to the samples was switched to a gas mixture consisting of 1.7% NH3 (Praxair, 99.9%) diluted in He (Praxair, UHP) at a flow rate of 305 mL min–1. The samples were exposed to this gas mixture for 1 h in order to saturate Brønsted acid O–H groups with NH3. The specific saturation temperature was chosen to minimize NH3 adsorption at Lewis acid centers since the maximum rate of NH3 desorption from Lewis acid sites in H-MFI was found to occur at 433 K. After completion of the saturation step, samples (at 433 K) were flushed in 300 mL min–1 He (Praxair, UHP) for 0.2 h. This step was followed by a treatment of the sample (held at 433 K) in 1% H2O diluted in He (Praxair, UHP) at a flow rate of 300 mL min–1 for a period of 8 h. H2O was introduced into the system via a syringe pump (Cole-Parmer) at a flow rate of 0.13 mL/h. This treatment was found to be necessary to remove NH3 bound to Lewis acid centers in samples. Samples (held at 433 K) were then purged in dry He (Praxair, He) at a flow rate of 300 mL min–1 for 4 h before being cooled to 323 K. NH3-TPD profiles were measured by heating samples at 5 K min–1 from 323 to 673 K under a gas mixture consisting of 1% Ar (Praxair, CSG) diluted in He (Praxair, UHP) at a flow rate of 300 mL min–1. A capillary connected directly below the sample carried the reactor effluent into a mass spectrometer (MKS, Cirrus) and was used to quantify the desorbed NH3. The NH3 response factor was calibrated using mixtures of NH3 and He. Ar was used as an internal standard to correct for drift in the NH3 response factor. NH3-TPD measurements on H2-treated Ga/H-MFI samples were conducted after NH3-TPD measurements on the same oxidized Ga/H-MFI samples. After an initial NH3-TPD measurement, samples at 823 K were exposed to 5% H2/He at a total flow rate of 300 mL min–1, for a duration of 1 h. For both oxidized and reduced Ga/H-MFI samples, the remaining steps in the experimental protocol were identical. The fraction of Brønsted acid O–H groups exchanged by Ga3+ species was estimated from eq 2 and measured values of NH3/Altot for H-MFI and Ga/H-MFI assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry between desorbed NH3 and Brønsted acid O–H groups.

29Si MAS and 27Al MAS NMR spectra were acquired at the NMR facility at the University of California, Davis, on a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. Samples (∼300 mg) were hydrated in a desiccator containing H2O for 24 h prior to measurement. Samples were then loaded into ZrO2 rotors. All 29Si MAS NMR spectra were collecting using a 7 mm probe at a spinning frequency of 6 kHz with a pulse length of 1.9 μs (corresponding to a 45° tip angle) and a relaxation delay time of 30 s. Spectra were referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS) for which the isotropic chemical shift was set to 0 ppm. Framework Si/Alf ratios were determined from 29Si MAS NMR spectra by integrating the areas of bands obtained by spectral deconvolution. (30) All 27Al MAS NMR spectra were collected using a 2.5 mm probe spinning at a frequency of 25 kHz with a pulse length of 0.23 μs (corresponding to a 30° tip angle) and a relaxation delay time of 0.2 s. The final spectra were obtained by averaging 8192 scans. Spectra were referenced with respect to aqueous Al(NO3)3 for which the isotropic chemical shift was set to 0 ppm. Tetrahedral framework Al centers in zeolites show a chemical shift of roughly 56 ppm relative to aq. Al(NO3)3 while octahedral Al centers in zeolites show no shift relative to aq. Al (NO3)3, i.e., a chemical shift of 0 ppm. (31) The relative fraction of tetrahedral and octahedral Al centers was determined by integrating the areas under spectral bands.
Ga K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data were acquired at beamline 5BMD at the Argonne Photon Source (APS). The monochromator energy was calibrated using β-Ga2O3, and all measurements were conducted in transmission mode. All edge energies were referenced to β-Ga2O3 for which the edge energy was set to 10375.1 eV. β-Ga2O3 standards β-Ga2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich) and Ga(acac)3 (Strem chemicals) were sealed inside Kapton tape for measurements. Ga/H-MFI samples (∼10 mg) were pressed into self-supporting pellets and placed inside a stainless steel 6-shooter sample holder. The sample holder was placed inside a quartz tube with a gas inlet and outlet and sealed at two ends with Kapton windows. The quartz tube was fitted inside a clam-shell furnace connected to a heater and temperature controller. Gases were metered to the in situ cell via mass flow controllers. XAS measurements were acquired on samples in their hydrated state at ambient conditions, upon calcination in 20% O2/He (Airgas, 100 mL min–1) to 773 K and upon treatment in 3% H2/He (Airgas, 100 mL min–1) at 603 K, 713 K, and 823 K. Both X-ray absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) measurements were made at the Ga K-edge. X-ray absorption spectra were background-corrected and normalized using the Athena software. (32) Ga K-edge energies were defined by the lowest energy inflection point in the edge region of the first derivative of the XAS spectrum. EXAFS spectra were Fourier transformed and fitted to the first coordination shell using the Artemis software, (32) and amplitude and phase shift scattering functions were calculated using the crystal structure of CaGa2O4 (33) in Artemis via FEFF6, while values for the amplitude reduction factor S02 were obtained by fitting the first coordination shell of the EXAFS spectra of β-Ga2O3. Wavelet transforms of EXAFS spectra were obtained by using the k2-weighted EXAFS signal (k2χ(k)) as an input to the HAMA software, (34) and wavelet contour plots were prepared using OriginPro 2017.
H2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles were measured using a home-built apparatus. Samples (∼0.18 g) were supported on a quartz wool plug placed inside a tubular quartz reactor with a thermocouple placed above the catalyst bed. Under 100 mL min–1 dry synthetic air (Praxair, ultra zero), samples were heated at 5 K min–1 to 773 K and held at this temperature for 1 h, before being cooled to 323 K. H2-TPR profiles were measured by heating samples at 10 K min–1 from 323 to 1023 K under a flowing gas mixture of 1% H2, 1% Ar diluted in He (Praxair, CSG) at a flow rate of 30 mL min–1. A capillary placed directly below the sample carried the reactor effluent to a mass spectrometer (MKS, Cirrus). The response factor for H2O was determined by flowing mixtures of H2O (introduced into the system via syringe pump) diluted in He (UHP). The Ar in the gas mixture was used as internal standard to correct for drift in the H2O mass spectrometer response factor.
2.3. Theoretical Calculations
All structures proposed for the isolated Ga3+ species were modeled using a hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method (35,36) applied to a large cluster model of MFI containing 437 tetrahedral atoms (T437), shown in Figure 1. A T14 cluster containing a distorted 6-ring at the intersection of the straight and sinusoidal channel and two adjacent 5-rings was treated quantum mechanically with the dispersion-corrected ωB97X-D (37,38) functional, while the remainder of the framework was described with molecular mechanics parameters taken from previous work (P2 parameter set). (36)

(Top right) Close-up of T14 QM region, with indication of T sites considered for Al substitution (T7 and T12). (Bottom left) Location of isolated framework Al in T14 QM region. (Bottom right) Location of proximate framework Al atoms in next-nearest neighboring (NNN) or next-next-nearest neighboring (NNNN) configuration in T14 QM region.
Both univalent and divalent site structures were investigated. The univalent site structures (e.g., [Ga(OH)2]+and [GaH2]+) compensate for the charge associated with an isolated Al atom in the MFI framework. The Al atom associated with these sites was placed in a T12 crystallographic position, which is located at the intersection of the straight and sinusoidal channels. This location is commonly selected for Al substitution in theoretical studies on H-MFI. (39−45) On the other hand, oxidized divalent cations, [Ga(OH)]2+ and [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs, and reduced divalent cations, [GaH]2+ and [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ and [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs, are compensated by proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms. Two cases with different Al–Al distances were examined: a next-nearest neighbor (NNN) pair, in which the two framework Al atoms are separated by one framework Si atom, and a next–next nearest neighbor (NNNN) pair, in which the two framework Al atoms are separated by two framework Si atoms. To create the pair sites, an additional Al atom was inserted in an NNN or NNNN T7 position relative to the T12 position (see Figure 1). This particular NNNN configuration was found to be relevant in earlier theoretical work (46) for ethane dehydrogenation catalyzed on [GaH]2+ structures in Ga/H-MFI.
Initial geometries were constructed with ZEOBUILDER. (47) Geometry optimizations and frequency calculations were performed using the ωB97X-D/6-31G(d,p) level of theory for the QM region. Subsequent energy refinements on the stationary points were calculated at the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level. All QM/MM calculations were performed with a developmental version of Q-Chem. (48) Gibbs free energies at reaction temperatures (773 K for oxidized structures and 673 K for reduced structures) were derived from a normal-mode analysis using the quasi-rigid rotor/harmonic oscillator approximation (36,49) on the various stationary points obtained from QM/MM. Phase diagrams for oxidized and H2-treated Ga3+ structures located at proximate cation-exchange sites associated with NNN and NNNN pairs of framework Al atoms were constructed by comparing the free energy of formation for various candidate structures starting from [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs and plotting the regions in which specific structures exhibit the lowest free energy of formation as a function of temperature and H2 partial pressure at a given H2O partial pressure. The following equations were used to determine the free energy of formation of specific Ga3+ structures from [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Characterization of Ga/H-MFI Prepared by Treatment of H-MFI with GaCl3 Vapor and Subsequent Removal of Ga-Bound Cl by H2 Reduction
When physical mixtures of anhydrous H-MFI and GaCl3 are heated to 478 K under vacuum, vapor-phase ion exchange occurs via the reaction of gas-phase GaCl3 monomers or Ga2Cl6 dimers (50) with Brønsted acid O–H groups associated with framework Al sites located inside the channels of H-MFI. This reaction, shown in Scheme 1, is assumed to result in the grafting of GaCl3 at cation-exchange sites associated with isolated framework Al atoms to form monovalent [GaCl2]+ cations or at proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms, either NNN (next-nearest neighbor) or NNNN (next-next-nearest neighbor), to form either divalent [GaCl]2+ cations or monovalent [GaCl2]+ cations. Reduction of the grafted samples in flowing 105 Pa H2 at 823 K resulted in near complete removal (>95% of Cl initially present; see Table S.1) of the Cl associated with Ga3+ species. Table 1 lists the composition of Ga/H-MFI samples prepared with Ga/Al ratios of 0.1 to 0.7. Attempts to synthesize samples with Ga/Al > 0.7 were unsuccessful; loss of Ga from such samples was observed during H2 reduction, presumably due to removal of Ga3+ as gas-phase GaHClx (51) (see Text S.1). HCl generated as a result of H2 treatment was collected in an H2O trap and quantified via chloride titration. HCl/Ga ratios determined by this means, shown in Table 1, ranged from 1.5 to 2.2 (with an average HCl/Ga = 1.7 ± 0.5). This stoichiometry suggests the grafting of GaCl3 predominantly produces [GaCl2]+ cations, as suggested in Scheme 1. Since most of the Cl in these cations is removed during H2 reduction, we propose that the [GaH2]+ cations form as a result of this treatment. Evidence for [GaH2]+ cations was obtained from in situ infrared spectra of reduced GaClx/H-MFI, which showed the presence of an infrared band at 2051 cm–1 which was absent in the infrared spectra of H-MFI upon H2 treatment (see Figure S.1). This band is assigned to Ga–H stretching vibrations, consistent with previous experimental and theoretical studies. (52−54)

Following H2 reduction of as-exchanged Ga/H-MFI, samples were oxidized in 2.0 × 104 Pa of O2 at 773 K for 1 h in order to form air-stable Ga3+ hydroxide species, as shown in Scheme 1. The resulting materials showed no evidence for the formation of crystalline β-Ga2O3 in Raman spectra of even the highest Ga/Al ratios synthesized (Ga/Al = 0.5, 0.7) (see Text S.2 and Figure S.2). Oxidized Ga/H-MFI samples were characterized in order to determine the fraction of Brønsted acid O–H groups that were ion-exchanged and the exchange stoichiometry of the resulting Ga3+ cations. The local chemical environment around Ga3+ centers was then characterized by Ga K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS). Theoretical calculations were performed in order to evaluate the stability of candidate Ga3+ structures on isolated cation-exchange sites and on proximate cation-exchange sites associated with NNN and NNNN pairs of framework Al atoms.
Infrared spectroscopy and temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) were used to probe the fraction of Brønsted acid O–H groups in oxidized Ga/H-MFI exchanged by Ga3+ and the exchange stoichiometry of the resulting Ga3+ cations. Figure 2a shows the infrared spectra of H-MFI and Ga/H-MFI samples measured under oxidizing conditions at 723 K. All spectra show a band at ∼3593 cm–1 attributable to ν(O–H) of Brønsted acid O–H groups (55) and a band at ∼3740 cm–1 attributable to ν(O–H) of Si–OH groups, located at defect sites inside the zeolite pores or at the external surfaces of the zeolite crystals. (56) As the Ga content in the samples increases, the area of the band at 3593 cm–1 decreases monotonically up to a Ga/Al ratio of ∼0.3, suggesting that Ga3+ species replace Brønsted acid O–H groups in these samples. For samples with Ga/Al ratios >0.3, the band at 3740 cm–1 decreases slightly in area (<30%), suggesting that GaCl3 may also have reacted with less acidic Si–OH groups.

(b) Fraction of H+ (Brønsted O–H) exchanged per Htotal+ determined from infrared spectra, as a function of Ga/Al ratio. Dotted lines indicate slope of plot and maximum extent of H+ exchange. Reported uncertainties are for 95% confidence intervals.
The infrared spectra of all Ga/H-MFI samples also show a weak band at 3660 cm–1, absent in the infrared spectra of H-MFI. This band has been attributed previously to Al–OH groups in extra-framework Al (EFAl) species (57) or to OH groups coordinated to extra-framework cations (for example, [Cu(OH)]+ cations in Cu-exchanged zeolites). (13,58) Contact with GaCl3(g) during vapor-phase exchange and with HCl(g) during Cl removal treatments could, in principle, lead to the extraction of framework Al and the concomitant formation of EFAl, in a manner similar to that reported for zeolites treated with SiCl4 vapor at elevated temperatures. (59) Na exchange (27) and NH3-TPD (discussed below) reveal that our parent H-MFI sample contains approximately 13–15% EFAl. Framework Si/Alf ratios, estimated via deconvolution of 29Si MAS NMR spectra (see Figure S.4) for H-MFI (Si/Alf = 16.8) were similar within 10–15% uncertainty to Si/Alf values for Ga/H-MFI (14.4–17.7) and to Si/Altot values from elemental analysis (16.5 ± 1.0) (see Table S.2). In addition, no discernible trend was observed in Si/Alf values as a function of Ga content. As discussed in the Text S.3, these data suggest that the fraction of EFAl is similar in H-MFI and in Ga/H-MFI samples. As a consequence, we infer that the band at 3660 cm–1 in the infrared spectra of Ga/H-MFI is most likely attributable to OH groups coordinated to Ga3+ centers in either [Ga(OH)]2+ or [Ga(OH)2]+ cations and [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs.
The fraction of Brønsted acid O–H groups replaced by Ga3+ cations can be determined for each Ga/Al ratio on the basis of eq 1 (Experimental and Theoretical Methods) and the integrated area of the ν(O–H) band at 3593 cm–1 observed in the infrared spectra of Ga/H-MFI and H-MFI. This fraction is plotted as a function of the Ga/Al ratio in Figure 2b. It is apparent from the slope of this plot (dotted line in Figure 2b) that, for Ga/Al ratios ≤0.3, each Ga3+ replaces approximately two Brønsted acid O–H groups. This exchange stoichiometry is consistent with the presence of divalent [Ga(OH)]2+ cations that involve the titration of two Brønsted acid O–H groups at proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms, by one Ga3+ atom. Consistent with this interpretation, the fraction of Brønsted acid O–H groups replaced by Ga3+ cations reaches a maximum value of approximately 50% at a Ga/Al ratio of ∼0.3. This maximum extent of Brønsted acid O–H exchange is similar to the total fraction of proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms in our sample of H-MFI (∼45% of Alf by Co2+ titration (27)). This finding suggests that, under oxidizing conditions, Ga3+ cations exchange predominantly with Brønsted acid O–H groups at proximate cation-exchange sites, rather than isolated cation-exchange sites. For samples with Ga/Al ratios >0.3, no further exchange of Brønsted acid O–H groups by Ga3+ cations is observed in Figure 2a,b. Raman spectroscopy showed no evidence for crystalline β-Ga2O3 in any of the Ga/H-MFI samples. Consequently, we hypothesize that an increase in Ga content beyond a Ga/Al ratio of 0.3 leads to the formation of GaOx oligomers that do not occupy cation-exchange sites. Evidence for the presence of such species will be presented below.
The extent of exchange of Brønsted acid O–H groups by Ga3+cations was also estimated by titrating the residual Brønsted acid O–H groups in Ga/H-MFI with gas-phase NH3. The protocol used here was that developed by Di Iorio et al. to selectively titrate residual Brønsted acid O–H groups in Cu- and Co-exchanged zeolites, without concomitant titration of Lewis acid sites by NH3. (60) NH3-TPD profiles for H-MFI and Ga/H-MFI, shown in Figure 3a, exhibit a single NH3 desorption feature at 660 K associated with desorption of NH3 from Brønsted acid O–H groups. (60) This feature decreases in area with increasing Ga content, consistent with the titration of fewer residual Brønsted acid O–H groups in Ga/H-MFI after Ga3+ exchange. The NH3/Altot value for H-MFI (Table 2) is less than unity: 0.87 ± 0.11, suggesting that approximately 13% of Altot is not associated with Brønsted acid O–H groups, likely present as EFAl. This estimated Brønsted acid O–H density of 0.87 ± 0.11 H+/Altot is also consistent with the value measured using Na+ exchange protocols (0.84 H+/Altot). (27) As observed in Table 2, the value of NH3/Altot decreases with increasing Ga content up to Ga/Al ratios of 0.3. For Ga/Al ratios higher than this value, the value of NH3/Altot becomes nearly constant, suggesting that exchange of Brønsted acid O–H groups by Ga3+ occurs predominantly at proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms. This finding is consistent with the infrared spectroscopy measurements discussed above.

The fraction of Brønsted acid O–H groups exchanged by Ga3+ cations at each Ga/Al ratio can be estimated using the measured values of NH3/Altot in conjunction with eq 2 (Experimental and Theoretical Methods). The results, plotted as a function of the Ga/Al ratio, are shown in Figure 3b and suggest that, for Ga/Al ratios ≤0.3, each Ga3+ center titrates approximately one Brønsted acid O–H group. This exchange stoichiometry is only consistent with Structure 2 in Scheme 1, i.e., [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs, in contrast to the result obtained from infrared spectroscopy, which suggested that, for Ga/Al ratios ≤0.3, each Ga3+ exchanged with two Brønsted acid O–H groups. It should be noted that the exchange stoichiometry of the Ga/Al = 0.1 sample was higher than one Brønsted acid O–H group replaced per Ga3+ (1.3 ± 0.3), consistent with the presence of [Ga(OH)]2+ cations in addition to [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs at low Ga/Al ratios. In addition, the maximum extent of exchange of Brønsted acid O–H groups, measured by NH3-TPD, is approximately 25%. This value is approximately a factor of 2 lower than the maximum extent of Brønsted acid O–H exchange measured via infrared spectroscopy (∼50%). The contradiction in exchange stoichiometries estimated by infrared spectroscopy and NH3-TPD can be resolved by examining the thermodynamics for forming Structures 1 and 2 from their reactants on proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms.
The Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf) at 773 K and 105 Pa for both [Ga(OH)]2+ cations (Structure 1) and [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs (Structure 2) was estimated starting from GaCl3, H2, O2, and two proximate Brønsted acid O–H groups associated with NNN and NNNN pairs of framework Al atoms. Given the distribution of framework Al atoms among different crystallographic positions in the zeolite framework, the Al–Al interatomic distance between proximate cation-exchange sites is likely to vary considerably. While current experimental and theoretical methods do not allow estimation of the distribution of Al site pairs in terms of interatomic framework Al–Al distances in our zeolite samples, the two types of proximate cation-exchange sites used here provide benchmarks for two representative classes of Al–Al site pairs. For optimized structures involving NNN pairs of Al framework atoms, the interatomic Al–Al distances are ≤5 Å, while for optimized structures involving NNNN pairs of framework Al atoms, the interatomic Al–Al distances are >5 Å. The formation of isolated [Ga(OH)2]+ cations from the same set of reactants and a Brønsted-acid O–H group associated with an isolated framework Al atom in the T12 position was also considered.
The Gibbs free energies of formation (ΔGf) obtained for [Ga(OH)]2+ cations, [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs, and isolated [Ga(OH)2]+ cations are shown in Table 3. It is apparent that the formation of [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs at proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms is more favorable (ΔGf = −379 kJ/mol and ΔGf = −384 kJ/mol on NNN and NNNN pairs of framework Al, respectively) than the formation of [Ga(OH)2]+ cations at cation-exchange sites associated with isolated framework Al atoms (ΔGf = −338 kJ/mol). In addition to electrostatic stabilization by the anionic zeolite framework, the [Ga(OH)2]+ cation in a [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pair is additionally stabilized via H-bonding between the Ga-bound OH group and the proximate Brønsted acid O–H group. The data in Table 3 also suggest that the formation of [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs at proximate cation-exchange sites associated with NNNN pairs of framework Al atoms is significantly more favorable than the formation of divalent [Ga(OH)]2+ cations at such cation-exchange sites (ΔGf = −296 kJ/mol). The Ga3+ center in a divalent [Ga(OH)]2+ cation is under considerable conformational strain resulting from the need to form a tetrahedron with 3 framework O atoms and 1 OH group. This conformational strain likely destabilizes the [Ga(OH)]2+ structure relative to the [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pair structure, for which the Ga3+ center can form a less strained tetrahedron with 2 framework O atoms and 2 OH groups. As noted above, H-bonding between the Ga-bound OH group and the proximate Brønsted acid O–H group may further stabilize this structure. On the other hand, at proximate cation-exchange sites associated with NNN pairs of framework Al atoms, the formation of [Ga(OH)]2+ cations is only slightly less favorable (ΔGf = −352 kJ/mol) than the formation of [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs (ΔGf = −379 kJ/mol). This suggests that, at lower H2O partial pressures (≤10 Pa H2O for dehydrated zeolites), [Ga(OH)]2+ cations will be increasingly thermodynamically favored over [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs at proximate cation-exchange sites with shorter Al–Al interatomic distances, such as those associated with NNN pairs of framework Al atoms (also see thermodynamic phase diagrams presented in Section 3.3). These findings highlight the sensitivity of Ga3+ structures to the interatomic distance between Al atoms in proximate cation-exchange sites: shorter interatomic Al–Al distances allow the Ga3+ center to bridge both cation-exchange sites with a lower conformational strain to form divalent [Ga(OH)]2+ cations, while longer interatomic Al–Al distances inhibit the formation of such structures, resulting instead in the formation of [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs.

Our theoretical calculations also suggest that, for [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs, H-bonding between the Ga-bound OH group and the proximate Brønsted acid O–H group shifts the O–H stretching frequency of the proximate Brønsted acid O–H group to 2436 cm–1, a value significantly lower than that for an isolated Brønsted acid O–H group, 3610 cm–1. This suggests that the proximate Brønsted acid O–H group in [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ pairs would be masked by the strong infrared absorption of the zeolite framework. The presence of a single infrared band reflecting this Brønsted acid O–H group is also unlikely, since the red-shift in the O–H stretching frequency may also depend on the proximity between Ga-bound OH groups and their corresponding proximate Brønsted acid O–H groups. This proximity is in turn expected to depend on the interatomic Al–Al distance in proximate cation-exchange sites. Therefore, the presence of either [Ga(OH)]2+ cations or [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs would result in an apparent exchange stoichiometry of two Brønsted acid O–H groups replaced per Ga3+ atom as measured via infrared spectroscopy monitored at 3593 cm–1. The proximate Brønsted acid O–H group in [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs should, in principle, be detectable by titration with NH3. This structure should therefore result in an exchange stoichiometry of one Brønsted acid O–H group replaced per Ga3+ atom, as measured via NH3-TPD. Furthermore, for low Ga/Al ratios (∼0.1), NH3-TPD indicates that between one and two Brønsted O–H groups are replaced per Ga3+ atom, suggesting that [Ga(OH)]2+ cations may also form in addition to [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs at low Ga/Al ratios. If Ga3+ siting is assumed to be thermodynamically controlled, it is plausible that, at low Ga/Al ratios, the most stable [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs form at proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms with Al–Al interatomic distances ≤5 Å. For low H2O partial pressures (≤10 Pa), such structures may readily undergo condensation to form [Ga(OH)]2+ cations, a conclusion supported by the phase diagrams presented in Figure 9. We therefore conclude on the basis of infrared spectroscopy, NH3-TPD, and theoretical calculations that, for Ga/Al ratios ∼0.1, [Ga(OH)]2+ cations form at proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms with Al–Al interatomic distances ≤5 Å. On the other hand, [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs form in greater proportion at proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms for which the Al–Al distances are >5 Å for Ga/Al ratios between 0.1 and 0.3. The concentration of [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs increases with increasing Ga/Al ratio until all proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms are saturated. For Ga/Al ratios higher than ∼0.3, the formation of neutral GaOx species occurs. Such species may be formed via hydrolysis of [Ga(OH)2]+ cations associated with isolated cation-exchange sites during the oxidation of the H2-reduced Ga/H-MFI at 773 K in O2.
Further evidence supporting the formation of [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs was obtained from Ga K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). XANES spectra of Ga/H-MFI and of two Ga3+ standards, β-Ga2O3 and Ga(acac)3, are shown in Figure 4. The Ga K-edge energy, defined as the lowest energy inflection in the first derivative of the absorption edge region of the XAS spectrum, was measured for both Ga3+ standards and Ga/H-MFI samples (at 773 K under O2); these values are shown in Table 4. The Ga K-edge energies for Ga/H-MFI samples (∼10 374.0–10 375.1 eV) are similar to those of the Ga3+ standards (10 375.1 eV for β-Ga2O3 and 10 376.6 eV for Ga(acac)3), confirming that Ga3+ cations in Ga/H-MFI samples have an oxidation state of +3 and are coordinated to O atoms. The maximum of the absorption intensity in the edge region for all Ga/H-MFI samples occurs at approximately 10 376 eV (Figure 4). The XANES spectra of β-Ga2O3 (Figure 4) shows two maxima in the edge region, one at 10 376 eV and the other at 10 379 eV, whereas the XANES spectrum of Ga(acac)3 shows a single maximum in the edge region at 10 379 eV. The XANES spectra of aqueous Ga–O complexes exhibit absorption intensity maxima at 10 378 eV for tetrahedral Ga–O complexes and at 10379 eV for octahedral Ga–O complexes. (61) These findings are consistent with the observation of two maxima in the XANES spectrum of β-Ga2O3, which contains Ga3+ in both tetrahedral and octahedral coordination with O atoms, (62) and the observation of only the higher energy maximum (∼10 379 eV) in Ga(acac)3, which contains Ga3+ only in octahedral coordination with O atoms. (63) Therefore, the observation in Figure 4 of a single absorption maximum at 10 376 eV for XANES spectra of all Ga/H-MFI suggests that exchanged Ga3+ cations are tetrahedrally coordinated with O atoms at all Ga/Al ratios.

bPowdered standards (acquired from Sigma-Aldrich and Strem Chemical) were spread on Kapton tape, which was then folded to yield an approximate absorption length of 2.
cGa/H-MFI samples (∼0.01 g) were pressed into self-supporting pellets and installed in a six-shooter sample holder inside the in situ XAS cell.
EXAFS spectra (k2-weighted) of Ga/H-MFI samples (shown in Figure S.8) were Fourier-transformed (FT) and analyzed in order to determine the structure of Ga3+ cations around the first coordination shell. The magnitudes of the (k2-weighted) FT Ga K-edge EXAFS spectra of Ga/H-MFI samples, collected at 773 K under flowing 20% O2/He, are shown in Figure 5. For Ga/H-MFI samples with Ga/Al ratios <0.2, sufficient X-ray absorption could not be achieved due to the low Ga content of these samples (<1 wt % Ga). As a result, our EXAFS analysis is limited to Ga/H-MFI with Ga/Al ratios ≥0.2. Also shown in Figure 5 is the magnitude of the FT-EXAFS spectrum of β-Ga2O3. The peak positions in these spectra do not correspond to exact interatomic distances, due to the phase shifts incurred by photoelectrons from absorbing and scattering atoms and, therefore, peak maxima appear 0.3–0.5 Å lower than true interatomic distances. (64) Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectra of all Ga/H-MFI samples and β-Ga2O3 (Figure 5) show dominant features between 1 and 2 Å in R-space corresponding to backscattering from O atoms coordinated to Ga3+ centers. The FT spectra of β-Ga2O3 in Figure 5 exhibits a large peak between 2 and 3 Å, corresponding to backscattering from next-neighbor Ga atoms in Ga–O–Ga linkages. The second coordination shell in the EXAFS spectra of all Ga/H-MFI samples also show features between 2 and 3 Å that are less intense than the feature in the EXAFS of β-Ga2O3. These features correspond to backscattering from framework Al or Si or extra-framework Ga atoms (for example, in condensed GaOx species).

EXAFS fitting of the first coordination shell was undertaken for spectra of Ga/H-MFI samples in order to determine the average number of neighboring O atoms and their interatomic distances from Ga3+ centers. The procedure used for EXAFS fits is outlined in detail in the Text S.5.
Satisfactory fits of the spectra were obtained for all Ga/H-MFI samples, as evidenced by the close agreement between dotted lines and the solid lines shown in Figure S.9a–d for the first-coordination shell. Fitted parameters for Ga/H-MFI spectra are presented in Table 5. These results suggest that, on average, each Ga3+ center is coordinated to 2 O atoms at an interatomic distance of approximately 1.77 Å and to 2 O atoms at an interatomic distance of approximately 1.92 Å. This interatomic bonding is consistent with the structure of tetrahedral [Ga(OH)2]+ cations, for which theoretical simulations (see Figures S.5–S.7 for theoretically generated structures) indicate that the Ga3+ cation is coordinated to 2 OH groups with a Ga–O interatomic distance of 1.79 Å and to 2 framework O atoms at a Ga–O interatomic distance of 1.99 Å. The fitted interatomic distance assigned to bonding between Ga3+ and Ga-bound OH groups (∼1.77 Å) agrees well with measured values for aqueous tetrahedral Ga(OH)4– complexes for which the Ga–O interatomic distance is ∼1.80 Å. (61) The fitted interatomic distance between Ga3+ and framework O atoms (∼1.92 Å) is approximately 0.07 Å lower than the distance for these bonds determined from our DFT calculations (∼1.99 Å). It should be noted that exact agreement between theoretical predictions of interatomic distances and values obtained from EXAFS fits is not expected. This discrepancy is well-documented and is ascribed to the effects of structural and thermal disorder on the absorber–scatterer interatomic pair distribution, which is assumed to have a Gaussian form in the conventional EXAFS equation. (65−67) A high degree of thermal and structural disorder (typical for measurements on highly dispersed metal sites in solids at high temperatures) may skew this pair distribution, leading to slightly lower fitted interatomic distances when conventional EXAFS analysis is used.

From the preceding discussion, it is clear that, under oxidizing conditions, exchange of Brønsted acid O–H groups by Ga3+ results in a saturation of proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs (NNN or NNNN) of framework Al atoms at a Ga/Al ratio of ∼0.3. EXAFS analysis of the first coordination shell around Ga3+ centers (Table 5), however, suggests that exchanged Ga3+ cations and neutral GaOx species (present at Ga/Al ratios >0.3) are both predominantly tetrahedrally ligated to O atoms. In the second-coordination shell, however, isolated Ga3+ cations are expected to be proximate to framework Al or Si atoms only. On the other hand, Ga3+ centers in multinuclear cationic Ga3+ species such as the [Ga2O2]2+ structures proposed by Hensen et al., (17) or in neutral GaOx species, are expected to be proximate to extra-framework Ga3+ atoms, via Ga–O–Ga linkages. Evidence for [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs at Ga/Al ratios ≤0.3 and for the formation of GaOx species at Ga/Al ratios >0.3 was obtained by wavelet analyses of the EXAFS spectra. This method of EXAFS data analysis allows the construction of a two-dimensional picture that enables the wavenumber space (k-space) and radial space (R-space) dependence of the EXAFS signal to be examined simultaneously. (34,70−74) A maximum in the wavelet transform occurs when the frequency and amplitude components in the transformed signal coincide with those in the wavelet. (34) A detailed description of the methods used to compute wavelet transforms of simulated Ga3+ structures and of experimentally measured EXAFS data is included in the Text S.6.
The wavelet transform of the k2-weighted EXAFS spectrum of the simulated [Ga(OH)2]+ cation (Figure 6a) shows a single intense feature in the second coordination shell at R = 2.5 Å in R-space and between 3 and 8 Å–1 in k-space, due to backscattering from the framework Al atom associated with the cation-exchange site. On the other hand, the wavelet transform of the experimentally measured EXAFS spectrum of β-Ga2O3 (Figure 6b) shows a single intense feature in the second coordination shell at R = 2.7 Å in R-space and between 7 and 13 Å–1 in k-space, due to backscattering from next-nearest neighboring Ga atoms. It is apparent that, while framework Al atoms associated with [Ga(OH)2]+ cations and next-nearest neighboring Ga atoms in β-Ga2O3 are at similar interatomic distances from Ga3+ centers, they exhibit very different k-space dependences. It has been shown that, in general, atoms with higher atomic numbers exhibit maxima in their backscattering amplitudes at higher wavenumbers (values of k) than atoms with lower atomic numbers. (64) Ga atoms, with their higher atomic number (Z = 31) exhibit a wavelet maximum at higher k values than that observed for the wavelet maximum of Al atoms (Z = 13). The wavelet transforms of k2-weighted EXAFS spectra of Ga/H-MFI with Ga/Al ratios ≤0.3 (i.e., Ga/Al = 0.2, 0.3; Figure 7a,b) show a single dominant feature in the second coordination shell at 2.5 Å in R-space and 3–8 Å–1 in k-space, consistent with backscattering from framework Al atoms. This finding confirms that Ga3+ cations in samples with Ga/Al ≤ 0.3 do not possess other extra-framework Ga3+ atoms in their vicinity and are therefore site isolated. Wavelet transforms of k2-weighted EXAFS spectra of Ga/H-MFI with Ga/Al ratios >0.3 (i.e., Ga/Al = 0.5, 0.7; Figure 7c,d) also show the feature associated with Al backscattering in the second coordination shell. However, a second, overlapping feature is also observed in these spectra with wavelet coordinates (R = 2.2–3.0 Å and k = 7–13 Å–1) consistent with backscattering from Ga atoms. This finding suggests that, at Ga contents higher than Ga/Al ∼ 0.3, Ga3+ species containing condensed Ga–O–Ga linkages coexist with exchanged [Ga(OH)]2+ cations and [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs.

The data presented and discussed above suggest that, for Ga/Al ratios ≤0.3, isolated [Ga(OH)]2+ cations and [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ pairs form at proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms. The population of the latter structure increases with increasing Ga loading, until the available proximate cation-exchange sites are saturated at a Ga/Al ratio of ∼0.3. The addition of Ga in excess of this saturation stoichiometry leads to Ga3+ structures in oxidized Ga/H-MFI with condensed Ga–O–Ga linkages that do not appear to be ion-exchanged at cation-exchange sites. Our data are therefore not consistent with the presence of binuclear [Ga2O2]2+ cations at Ga/Al ratios >0.3, as proposed by Hensen et al. (17) We suggest instead that the addition of Ga at levels higher than Ga/Al ratios of 0.3 leads to the formation of weakly bound [Ga(OH)2]+ cations at residual cation-exchange sites associated with isolated framework Al atoms. In the presence of trace levels of H2O during calcination, these structures may de-anchor via reaction of [Ga(OH)2]+ with H2O to form a Brønsted acid O–H group and mobile Ga(OH)3 species, which may undergo subsequent condensation to form neutral, GaOx oligomers with structures that may resemble the Ga4O4 complexes proposed by Faro et al. (75) As noted above, Ga–O–Ga linkages in these structures are detectable by wavelet analysis of the EXAFS spectra. Our data, however, do not let us discern whether the GaOx species are located inside the zeolite micropores or on the surface of the zeolite crystals.
3.3. The State of Ga3+ Cations in H2-Treated Ga/H-MFI
We next report our findings on the structure of Ga3+ species produced by H2 reduction of oxidized Ga/H-MFI. Scheme 2 illustrates several pathways by which [Ga(OH)]2+ cations and [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs at proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms might undergo reduction. According to this scheme, the reaction between divalent [Ga(OH)]2+ cations (Structure 1) and one equivalent of H2 could result in the reprotonation of one cation-exchange site and the formation of [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs (Structure 3). [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs (Structure 2) may also react with one equivalent of H2 to form [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs (Structure 3) and 1 equiv of H2O. [Ga(OH)H]+ cations may undergo condensation with the proximate Brønsted acid O–H group to form [GaH]2+ cations (Structure 4) and form one equivalent of H2O. Alternatively, [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs could further react with one equivalent of H2 to form [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs (Structure 5) and one equivalent of H2O.

H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles of Ga/H-MFI with Ga/Al ratios of 0.1–0.3 are shown in Figure 8, as the molar consumption rate of H2 per gram of catalyst (Figure 8a) and as the molar formation rate of H2O per gram of catalyst (Figure 8b). A single H2 consumption and H2O formation peak is observed at 723 K for all three Ga/H-MFI samples; the intensities of these features increase with increasing Ga content. The H2O formation profiles for Ga/H-MFI (Figure 8b) exhibit an additional feature for H2O formation at temperatures >823 K. This feature was also observed in the H2-TPR profile of H-MFI and is likely due to dehydroxylation of proximate Si–OH groups and of framework Al atoms that undergo dealumination at temperatures >1000 K. (76,77)

The area under the H2 consumption and H2O generation peaks can be integrated to assess the molar consumption of H2 and the molar formation of H2O per Ga atom. Integrated H2O molar yields for Ga/H-MFI samples were corrected for H2O desorption from the zeolite by subtracting the integrated H2O molar yield for H-MFI from that of Ga/H-MFI. These data, presented in Table 6, suggest that, for Ga/Al ratios of 0.1 to 0.3, approximately 1 equivalent of H2 is consumed per Ga atom. For Ga/Al ratios ≤0.1, these data are consistent with the reduction of [Ga(OH)]2+ cations (∼30% of the Ga3+ in oxidized Ga/Al = 0.1 sample, by NH3-TPD) to either [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs or divalent [GaH]2+ cations. H2/Ga ratios of 1 are also consistent with the reduction of [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs to either [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs (Structure 3) or divalent [GaH]2+ cations (Structure 4). However, the observed H2 consumption ratios are not consistent with the reduction of [Ga(OH)]2+ or [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs to [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs (Structure 5), since both reactions require the consumption of two equivalents of H2 per Ga atom. The formation of [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs and [GaH]2+ cations from [Ga(OH)]2+ cations requires the formation of zero and one equivalents of H2O, respectively, while the formation of these two structures from [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs would require the formation of one and two equivalents of H2O, respectively. Measured H2O/Ga and H2O/H2 ratios determined from H2-TPR profiles for all three Ga/H-MFI samples (Table 6) are greater than 1 but less than 2, with values decreasing closer to unity with increasing Ga/Al ratio. These data suggest that, under the conditions prevailing during H2-TPR, [Ga(OH)]2+ cations and [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs convert to both [GaH]2+ cations and [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs; [GaH]2+ cations appear to be present at all Ga/Al ratios but in a higher proportion at lower Ga/Al ratios.

aRatios were obtained by integrating the area of H2 molar consumption and the H2O molar formation feature at 723 K and normalizing these areas by the molar Ga content. Integrated H2O formation was corrected for H2O desorption from H-MFI using the H2-TPR profile of H-MFI.
bObtained from NH3-TPD profiles of H2-treated Ga/H-MFI samples. NH3/Altot values from these experiments were used together with eq 2 in order to estimate H+exch/H+tot. These values were then normalized by the Ga/Alf ratio (obtained by dividing Ga/Altot values by the Alf/Altot value for H-MFI) in order to obtain values of H+exch/Ga.
Also shown in Table 6 is the fraction of Brønsted acid O–H groups replaced by Ga3+ for H2-treated Ga/H-MFI samples, determined from NH3-TPD. Exchange stoichiometries determined from these data suggest that, for the Ga/Al = 0.1 sample, two Brønsted acid O–H groups are replaced per Ga3+ atom, consistent with the presence of [GaH]2+ cations in this sample after H2 treatment. With an increase in Ga content (up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.3), the exchange stoichiometry of H2-treated Ga/H-MFI decreases to between one and two Brønsted acid O–H groups replaced per Ga3+ atom, consistent with a higher concentration of [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs as the Ga/Al ratio increases. In conclusion, NH3-TPD and H2-TPR data provide evidence for the formation of [GaH]2+ cations at low Ga/Al ratios (Ga/Al = 0.1) and the formation of [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs in increasing concentration for Ga/Al ratios between 0.1 and 0.3.
We have shown above that, under oxidizing conditions, the formation of [Ga(OH)]2+ cations at proximate cation-exchange sites depends sensitively on the framework Al–Al interatomic distance and H2O partial pressure. In an analogous manner, we propose that the stability of [GaH]2+ cations and their tendency to decompose into [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ or [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs depends on both the framework Al–Al interatomic distance between proximate cation-exchange sites and the partial pressures of H2 and H2O. To assess the validity of this hypothesis, we generated theoretical phase diagrams in order to illustrate the regions of stability for various Ga3+ structures as a function of temperature and H2 partial pressure for a given H2O partial pressure. Each region of stability in these phase diagrams is representative of a Ga3+ structure that exhibits the lowest free energy of formation from [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs. Equations 3 and 4 (Experimental and Theoretical Methods) were used to calculate these free energies of formation. Phase diagrams were generated for Ga3+ structures at proximate cation-exchange sites associated with both NNN and NNNN pairs of framework Al atoms in order to assess the effect of framework Al–Al interatomic distance on the stability of Ga3+ species. Figure 9 shows the phase diagrams for stability of Ga3+ species at temperatures between 473 and 823 K, at H2 partial pressures ranging between 10–1 and 106 Pa, and for a fixed H2O partial pressure of 10 Pa. Phase diagrams for additional H2O partial pressures are included in Figures S.10 and S.11. As seen in Figure 9, at an H2O partial pressure of 10 Pa and for all temperatures, [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs are the most favorable structure on proximate cation-exchange sites associated with NNNN pairs of framework Al atoms when Ga/H-MFI is in the oxidized state (H2 partial pressure <102 Pa). When the interatomic Al–Al distance is lowered to ≤5 Å for NNN pairs of framework Al atoms in Figure 9, [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs are stable only for temperatures <623 K under oxidizing conditions. Above this temperature, the phase diagram predicts that [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs would undergo intrapair condensation to form [Ga(OH)]2+ cations. These findings are in agreement with experimental observations discussed earlier.
Figure 9
Figure 9. Theoretical thermodynamic phase diagrams for Ga3+ structures at cation-exchange sites associated with NNNN and NNN proximate framework Al atoms. Colored regions reflect a Ga3+ structure that has the lowest free energy of formation from [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs at a given temperature (T) and hydrogen partial pressure (PH2) and water partial pressure (PH2O) of 10 Pa. The H2O partial pressure used for this diagram is representative of conditions prevalent during H2-TPR and NH3-TPD.
Upon reaction between [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs and H2 (>102 Pa) and in the presence of 10 Pa H2O, the phase diagram in Figure 9 indicates that the conversion of [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs at NNNN cation-exchange sites into [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ pairs is highly favorable thermodynamically. [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ pairs are the most stable structure throughout the temperature range examined (473–823 K) and at H2 partial pressures as high as 105 Pa. At H2 pressures >105 Pa and temperatures >673 K (and a fixed H2O partial pressure of 10 Pa), Figure 9 shows that [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs on NNNN cation-exchange sites may further reduce to [GaH2]+–H+ pairs. These stability trends also appear to be a strong function of H2O partial pressure. Under conditions with lower H2O partial pressure (10–1 Pa), the phase diagram for NNNN cation-exchange sites (Figure S.10) predicts that the [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs would form [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs at H2 partial pressures as low as 3 × 103 Pa and temperatures >700 K. On the other hand, for H2 pressures lower than 3 × 103 Pa and at temperatures higher than 700 K, [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs would undergo intrapair condensation to form [GaH]2+ cations.
For Ga3+ structures at NNN cation-exchange sites, the phase diagram in Figure 9 predicts that, at temperatures <623 K and H2 partial pressures >102 Pa (and fixed H2O partial pressure 10 Pa), [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs at NNN cation-exchange sites would also form [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs. At temperatures >623 K, these structures would convert into [GaH]2+ cations. [GaH]2+ cations at NNN proximate cation-exchange sites appear to be stable and resistant to the formation of [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs at all H2 partial pressures tested. Even at very low H2O partial pressures (10–1 Pa), [GaH]2+ cations are still the most thermodynamically stable structure in the presence of H2 (see Figure S.11).
Further evidence for the presence of GaHx cations was obtained from in situ infrared spectra of Ga/H-MFI samples, taken at 473 K, after treating Ga/H-MFI samples in 2.5% H2/He for 1 h at 823 K. Spectra of all three Ga/H-MFI samples (Ga/Al = 0.2, 0.3, 0.5) are shown in Figure 10. Two bands are observed at approximately 2040 and 2060 cm–1, that are absent in the infrared spectra of oxidized Ga/H-MFI samples. In order to assign these vibrational modes to specific GaHx structures, we examined Ga–H vibrational frequencies computed from QM/MM calculations, for [GaH]2+ cations, [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs, and [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs. The predicted frequency for Ga–H stretches in [GaH]2+ cations is 2059 cm–1 while, for [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs, the predicted Ga–H stretching frequency is 2109 cm–1. For [GaH2]+ cations (likely present as [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs), the symmetric and asymmetric Ga–H stretching frequencies are predicted to be 2003 and 2043 cm–1, respectively. We, therefore, assign the band at 2060 cm–1 in the infrared spectra of Ga/H-MFI to Ga–H stretching vibrations in [GaH]2+ cations. We also assign the experimentally observed band at 2040 cm–1 to asymmetric Ga–H stretching vibrations in [GaH2]+ cations. These assignments are consistent with previous observations of GaHx species in the infrared spectra of H2 treated Ga/H-MFI. (52) We were unable to observe the Ga–H stretching frequency predicted for [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs in our spectra, likely because of low H2O partial pressures prevalent in our transmission infrared pellets (∼30 mg sample). Low H2O concentrations (∼10–1 Pa) may enable [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs to reduce to [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs, as predicted by our theoretical calculations. It should also be noted that the relative intensity of the 2040 cm–1 band in Figure 10 increases as a function of Ga/Al, consistent with the presence of a higher concentration of [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs or [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs with increasing Ga content.

In situ infrared “difference” spectra of Ga/H-MFI samples at 473 K, after treatment in 2.5% H2/He at 823 K for 1 h. “Difference” spectra were obtained by subtracting the infrared spectra of H-MFI at 473 K from the normalized infrared spectra of Ga/H-MFI at 473 K. All spectra were normalized to the framework Si–O–Si overtone bands between 1900 and 2100 cm–1. Dotted lines show Ga–H vibrational modes.
Additional information about the structures of Ga3+ cations in H2-treated Ga/H-MFI was obtained from the XANES portion of X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements conducted on H2-treated Ga/H-MFI samples. As reported in prior studies, (10,12,75,78) we observe that, upon heating Ga/H-MFI in H2, the XANES absorption maximum shifts from 10 376.6 eV for oxidized Ga/H-MFI to approximately 10 372 eV for Ga/H-MFI, H2-treated at 823 K, as seen in Figure 11a for the Ga/Al = 0.3 sample. An increase in temperature from 603 to 823 K during treatment in H2 results in an increase in the intensity of the lower energy absorption edge (∼10 372 eV).

Figure 11. (a) Ga K-edge XANES spectra of H2-treated Ga/H-MFI (Ga/Al = 0.3) at various temperatures during heating of oxidized Ga/H-MFI in 3% H2/He. (b) Difference (or Delta) XANES spectra of H2-treated Ga/H-MFI (Ga/Al = 0.3) obtained by subtracting the XANES spectrum for oxidized Ga/H-MFI from the XANES spectrum of H2-treated Ga/H-MFI at 603, 713, and 823 K. Dotted lines in delta XANES plot indicate positions of features at 10 375.1, 10 373.6, and 10 372 eV.
Previous XANES studies of reduced Ga/H-MFI have attributed the feature at 10 372 eV to the presence of Ga+. (10,12,21) This interpretation has been brought into question by the recent work of Getsoian et al., who examined the effects of Ga coordination and ligation on Ga K-edge XANES spectra. (78) XANES spectra of Ga3+ organometallic compounds in which the coordination and identity of Ga-bound ligands was varied systematically revealed that, for every O ligand in a 4-coordinate Ga3+ compound, replaced by a less electronegative, more strongly σ-donating H (hydride) or R (alkyl) ligand, the XANES absorption maximum (and edge energy) decreased by approximately 1.5 eV. In addition, when the coordination number around Ga3+ decreased from a 4 to 3, an additional 1.5 eV decrease in the XANES absorption maximum occurred. (78) On the basis of these data, it was proposed that 3-coordinate [GaH2]+ cations form upon H2 treatment of Ga/H-BEA. (78)
We can predict the XANES absorption maximum (or edge energy) for different GaHx species in H2-treated Ga/H-MFI, using the guidelines developed by Getsoian et al. (78) For [Ga(OH)]2+ and [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs, which have a XANES absorption maximum at 10 376.6 eV, H2 reduction of these species to 4-coordinate [Ga(OH)H]+ cations is expected to decrease the position of the absorption maximum by ∼1.5 eV to 10 375.1 eV. The conversion of [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs to form 4-coordinate [GaH]2+ cations is not expected to affect the XANES absorption maximum since both structures have 3 O ligands and 1 H ligand. Further reduction of both species ([Ga(OH)H]+ and [GaH]2+ cations) to 4-coordinate [GaH2]+ cations is expected to decrease the position of the XANES absorption maximum by another 1.5 eV to about 10 373.6 eV. As proposed by Getsoian et al., the weakened Lewis acidity of Ga3+ in 4-coordinate [GaH2]+ cations may result in the loss of the dative Ga–Of bond at high temperatures, to form 3-coordinate [GaH2]+ cations, possessing only one framework Ga–Of bond. (78) Such a conversion would further lower the XANES absorption maximum by 1.5 eV to about 10 372.1 eV. Our XANES measurements presented in Figure 11a for the Ga/Al = 0.3 sample (XANES spectra for other Ga/Al ratios are given in Figure 12a–c) show a decrease in the energy of the absorption maximum from 10 376.6 eV for oxidized Ga/H-MFI to about 10 372 eV upon reduction in H2 at 823 K (a ∼4.6 eV decrease), consistent with the presence of 3-coordinate [GaH2]+ cations in H2-treated samples.

Figure 11b shows the difference XANES spectra for the Ga/Al = 0.3 sample, at various temperatures during treatment in H2 from ambient temperatures to 823 K. Difference XANES spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectrum of oxidized Ga/H-MFI at 773 K from the spectrum of H2-treated Ga/H-MFI. Upon heating oxidized Ga/H-MFI in H2 to 603 K, the difference XANES spectra show the emergence of three features at 10 375.1, 10 373.5, and 10 372 eV that are lower in energy than the absorption maximum for oxidized Ga/H-MFI (10 376.6 eV). On the basis of the preceding discussion, the feature at 10 375.1 eV may reflect either 4-coordinate [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs or 4-coordinate [GaH]2+ cations. On this basis, we assign the feature at 10 373.5 eV to 4-coordinate [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs and the lowest energy feature to 3-coordinate [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs. As seen in Figure 11b, we observed that, upon heating samples in H2 from 603 to 713 K and finally to 823 K, the feature at 10 372 eV increases in intensity and becomes the dominant feature in the difference XANES spectrum at 823 K. The spectrum continues to evolve even as samples are heated past the peak temperature in the H2-TPR response (∼723 K), suggesting that the feature at 10 372 eV is not likely to be due to a Ga3+ species that is further reduced than 4-coordinate [GaH2]+ cations but rather due to a Ga3+ species with a lower coordination to framework O atoms. The spectrum in Figure 11b suggests that 3-coordinate [GaH2]+ cations form in increasing concentration with increasing temperature.
As seen in Figure 12a–c, a similar increase in the intensity of the absorption maximum at 10 372 eV with an increase in temperature was observed in XANES spectra of other H2-treated samples of Ga/H-MFI (Ga/Al = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 0.7) suggesting that 3-coordinate [GaH2]+ cations may be present at all Ga/Al ratios. On the basis of our previous characterization, which showed that [GaH]2+ cations form in greater concentration at low Ga/Al ratios, we propose that the observed similarity in the absorption maxima (10 372 eV), regardless of Ga/Al ratio, is likely a result of a higher absorption intensity of 3-coordinate [GaH2]+ cations in comparison to 4-coordinate [GaH]2+ or [GaH2]+ cations.
A decrease in Ga3+ coordination from 4 to 3 corresponds to a change in hybridization around the metal center from sp3 to sp2. Consequently, the Ga 4pz orbital becomes nonbonding in 3-coordinate Ga3+ structures. In a similar manner to what has been shown for XANES of low-coordinated Zn2+ compounds, (79) the allowed photoelectron excitation of a Ga 1s electron into the nonbonding Ga 4pz orbital would result in a stronger absorption at the Ga K-edge than for a similar 1s electron excitation into bonding 4p orbitals. Therefore, even if 3-coordinate [GaH2]+ cations were present at a lower concentration relative to 4-coordinate [GaH]2+ cations at low Ga/Al ratios, these species would be expected to dominate the XANES absorption edge. We also note that the absorption maximum at 823 K for the Ga/Al = 0.1 sample (∼10 373 eV) seen in Figure 12c is about 1 eV higher than the absorption maxima for the samples with Ga/Al = 0.2 and Ga/Al = 0.3 (∼10 372 eV). The presence of [GaH]2+ cations (with an absorption maximum of ∼10 375 eV), in coexistence with some 3-coordinate [GaH2]+ cations (with an absorption maximum of ∼10 372 eV) at low Ga/Al ratios, may be responsible for this observation. The EXAFS spectra of H2-treated Ga/H-MFI, when fit to a 2 shell Ga–O model, showed a total decrease in Ga–O coordination from 4 in oxidized Ga/H-MFI to between 2 and 3 in Ga/H-MFI treated in H2 at 723 K (see Text S.8 and Table 4). Due to the weak photoelectron scattering from H atoms, (80) the observed decrease in Ga–O coordination is consistent with the replacement of Ga-bound OH ligands with H ligands. We could not perform a more detailed analysis of the EXAFS spectra of H2-treated Ga/H-MFI due to the coexistence of multiple Ga species.
4. Conclusions
Ga/H-MFI with Ga/Al ratios ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 was synthesized via the vapor-phase reaction of dehydrated H-MFI with GaCl3. This process results in the exchange of Brønsted acid O–H groups by monovalent [GaCl2]+ cations. The maximum level of cation exchange achievable by this means is [GaCl2]+/Altot ∼0.7. H2 reduction at 823 K of the as-exchanged zeolites results in the stoichiometric removal of Ga-bound Cl as HCl and the formation of [GaH2]+ cations. Upon O2 oxidation at 773 K, these structures form oxidized Ga3+ species; however, crystalline β-Ga2O3 is not detectable by Raman spectroscopy. For Ga/Al = 0.1, about half of the [GaH2]+ cations are oxidized to divalent [Ga(OH)]2+ cations, bound to proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms located ≤5 Å apart, whereas the remainder [GaH2]+ cations are oxidized to [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs bound to proximate cation-exchange sites associated with pairs of framework Al atoms located >5 Å apart. For Ga/Al ratios above 0.1 but below 0.3, an increasing fraction of the cation-exchanged Ga3+ is present as [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs bound to proximate cation-exchange sites. For Ga/Al ratios higher than 0.3, wavelet analysis of EXAFS data shows that neutral GaOx species, not associated with cation-exchange sites, are formed. Upon H2 reduction of oxidized Ga/H-MFI, [Ga(OH)]2+ cations and [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs form [GaH]2+ cations at low Ga/Al ratios (∼0.1) and [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs for Ga/Al ≤ 0.3. Phase diagrams calculated to assess the thermodynamic stability of species formed upon H2 reduction of [Ga(OH)2]+–H+ cation pairs indicate that [GaH]2+ cations are more stable at proximate cation-exchange sites with framework Al–Al interatomic distances ≤5 Å, while for proximate cation-exchange sites with framework Al–Al interatomic distances >5 Å, [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs are more likely to form when H2 reduction is carried out with a background H2O partial pressure of 10 Pa. For lower partial pressures of H2O (10–1 Pa), the calculated phase diagrams predict that [Ga(OH)H]+–H+ cation pairs associated with NNNN framework Al atoms further reduce to [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs. Evidence for [GaH]2+ cations and [GaH2]+–H+ cation pairs was obtained via infrared spectroscopy under reducing conditions. For temperatures above 713 K, XANES data suggests that 4-coordinate [GaH2]+ cations transform to 3-coordinate [GaH2]+ cations. The preferential formation of [GaH]2+ cations at low Ga/Al ratios (∼0.1) is a consequence of the thermodynamic preference for these cations to locate at cation-exchange sites associated with framework Al atoms that are ≤5 Å apart. A summary of how Ga3+ speciation changes with Ga/Al ratio in both the oxidized and reduced forms of Ga/H-MFI is shown in Figure 13. The present study provides essential information for understanding the structure of reduced Ga3+ species as active centers for the dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization of light alkanes to alkenes and aromatics.
