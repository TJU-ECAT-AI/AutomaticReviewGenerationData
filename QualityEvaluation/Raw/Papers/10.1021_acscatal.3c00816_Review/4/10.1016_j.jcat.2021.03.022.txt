Abstract
Subnanometric clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) encapsulated inside the pores or cages of zeolite crystals can remarkably enhance their stability and then broaden the catalytic applications. We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction. The solid proof for the anchoring effect by forming monodispersed precursor of (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5]− and final active site of (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=1~15) was firstly provided in the present study by 119Sn NMR, XAFS and in-situ XPS spectra. The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity. This finding has profound significance for understanding the mechanism of heteroatom-containing zeolites as a novel support for highly dispersed metal catalysts.

1. Introduction
Supported metal catalysts comprising single atoms or subnanometric clusters show superior atom utilization efficiency than traditional ones
[1]
. Especially for precious metals, such as Pt, Pd, Ru and Rh, the large dosage of metal active sites will undoubtedly multiply the cost of traditional metal catalysts, which is not conducive to large-scale industrial application
[2]
. The preparation of single-atom or subnanometric clusters has thus become the primary choice for precious metal catalysts. Once the active site becomes as small as single atom size, new features are expected to emerge such as a sharp increase of the surface free energy, quantum size effect, unsaturated ligand environment and strong metal-support interaction, rendering single-atom metal catalysts superior catalytic performance
[3]
.
Propylene, with an annual assumption of 79 million metric tons, has found wide applications for the production of polypropylene, propane oxides (acetone, propylene oxide and acrylic acid, etc.) and acrylonitrile
[4][4]
,
[5]
. Traditionally, propylene is produced as a by-product of naphtha cracking, which cannot meet the continually increasing global demands for the downstream products of propylene. Moreover, due to the fluctuation of oil price and the growth of shale gas production, there has always been a concern on producing high value-added olefin from dehydrogenation of cheap alkanes
[6]
. So far, a number of large-scale propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene units have been put into production worldwide, which has become another major way to produce propylene besides conventional cracking processes. Supported Pt catalysts are often used for the PDH process because Pt is active for C-H activation whereas much less active for unfavorable C-C cracking
[7]
. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is a strong endothermic reaction with small chemical equilibrium constant, and thus requires high reaction temperatures
[8]
. As such, the coking occurs easily during the reaction process and the Pt particles tend to grow large, resulting in rapid catalyst deactivation and decline of product selectivity
[9]
.
In fact, the growth of metal active sites under higher temperature environment during either preparation or subsequent catalytic reactions is a common issue that the supported metal catalysts encounter, especially for the single atoms or subnanometric clusters
[10]
. Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals
[11]
. Microporous zeolite materials with highly crystalline structure, large specific surface area and well-defined pore channels show intrinsic confinement effect as the superb carriers for metal catalysts

. Unfortunately, the metal species hardly enter into the zeolite channels of subnano-sized pore windows by impregnation due to the diffusion constrains, but mainly locate on the crystal external surface, showing unsatisfied performance in stabilizing metal species under harsh reaction conditions
[19]
. Recently, in-situ encapsulation of metal species in constructing zeolite frameworks has been frequently reported

. Liu et al. incorporated Pt subnanometer clusters into the cups and cages of MWW framework during the structural transformation of the two-dimensional (2D) lamellar MCM-22 precursor into its corresponding three-dimensional (3D) structure
[16]
. Xiao group successfully fixed the metal nanoparticles (Pt, Pd, Rh and Ag) within zeolite crystals via a controllable seed-directed growth method
[17]
. Sun et al. synthesized single-atom Rh catalysts embedded in MFI-type zeolites under hydrothermal conditions and subsequent ligand-protected direct H2 reduction
[18]
.
For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only “geometric effect” by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also “electronic effect” through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact. The “electronic effect” has been reported to tune the adsorption strength of C3 intermediates in the PDH process
[8]
,
[20]
. To combine the complementary advantages of zeolite structure and additives in one matrix, several studies have tried to incorporate Pt into Sn-Beta zeolite, while only evenly dispersed surface nanoparticles were obtained. Xu et al. grafted HSnBu3 and Pt(COD)Me2 compounds successively onto the dealuminated Beta zeolite and then removed the organic ligands by H2 reduction, leading to the formation of Pt nanoparticles with an average diameter of 1.26 nm on the outer surface of the crystals, rather than in the confined pores
[21]
. In another case, it seemed that the Pt nanoclusters were also failed to be trapped in the framework because the Pt precursors readily turned to be large particles during the air calcination step
[22]
. Nevertheless, the metal aggregation upon air-calcination has been well suppressed in case of K-PtSn@MFI catalyst by introducing K+ in the synthetic gel, resulting in regioselective location of subnanometric Pt clusters in sinusoidal channels
[23]
. In the above two cases where Pt was introduced into Sn-Beta zeolite
[21]
,
[22]
, the framework Sn atoms favored higher Pt dispersion and superior catalytic performance, but no direct evidence was provided to show how the skeleton tin species anchor the platinum species. Very recently, Ryoo et al. reported a high-performance propane dehydrogenation catalyst with rare earth metals as auxiliaries, that is, rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles confined in a mesoporous MFI zeolite
[24]
.
Herein, subnanometric Pt clusters (Pt single atoms and ultrafine clusters) were trapped into Sn-Beta zeolite by a simple wet impregnation of Pt salts onto Sn-Beta followed by direct hydrogen reduction, where the zeolite support with high framework Sn content was critical to provide enough anchors for Pt species. Specially, the solid proof for the anchoring effect by forming (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] − species was revealed in the present study, which is the first report disclosing how framework Sn atoms are interacting with Pt species. The location of subnanometric Pt clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) within pores wall of *BEA crystals in the form of (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=1~15) were also revealed. Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
All chemicals and reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers. H-Beta aluminosilicate (Si/Al = ~11) was provided by Shanghai Xinnian Petrochemical Additives Co. Ltd., China. HNO3 solution (65 wt%), TEAOH solution (25 wt%), ammonium fluoride (>99%), and SnCl4·5H2O (>99%), were purchased from Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Chloroplatinic acid (>99.9%, Pt ≥ 37.5%) was purchased from CIVI. The chemicals were used as received without further purification.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
The parent H-Beta was calcined in air at 600 °C for 6 h and then it was refluxed in HNO3 solution (65 wt%) with a solid to liquid ratio of 1 g: 50 mL at 140 °C for 2 h. The acid treatment was repeated twice, resulting a siliceous zeolite with a Si/Al ratio over 2000. The product, denoted as DA-Beta, was employed as the silica source for synthesizing Sn-Beta zeolite. Following our previous method
[25]
, Sn-Beta was hydrothermally synthesized via a structural reconstruction route. The gel with a molar composition of 1.0 SiO2: 1/x SnO2: 0.5 TEAOH: 7.5 H2O: 0.5 NH4F (“x” represents different Si/Sn ratios) was crystallized in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 140 °C for 1–2 h under static condition. The as-made products were collected by filtration, washing with deionized water and dried at 80 °C overnight, followed by calcination in air at 550 °C for 6 h, denoted as Sn(x)-Beta. All silica Beta (Si-Beta) was prepared by the above method without adding Sn source. Pt catalysts (Pt loading = 0.375 wt%) supported on Si-Beta and Sn(80)-Beta zeolites were prepared by impregnation method with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (H2PtCl6 = 0.5 mg·mL−1). The impregnated samples were dried at 80 °C for 4 h to obtain the catalyst precursors, named as Pt-Si-Beta-P and Pt-Sn-Beta-P. The catalyst precursors were in-situ reduced at 500 °C under H2 flow, resulting in Pt-catalysts. More experimental details were presented in the

2.3. Catalyst characterization
UV visible (UV–vis) diffuse reflectance spectra were collected on a Shimadzu UV 2700 spectrophotometer utilizing barium sulfate as the reference. 119Sn MAS NMR was measured on a VARIAN VNMRS 400WB NMR spectrometer at a frequency of 79.43 MHz using one pulse method, a spinning rate of 3 kHz, a recycling delay of 60 s. For the dehydrated sample, it was evacuated at 723 K for 3 h and then transferred into the rotor under a dry N2 atmosphere. For the reductive sample, it was reduced at 773 K for 2 h by H2 and then transferred into the rotor under a dry N2 atmosphere. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was employed to check the structure and crystallinity of zeolites as well as those of metal nanoparticles. The patterns were collected on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 35 kV and 25 mA with a step width of 0.02° in the 2θ range of 5−50°. The in-situ PXRD patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer equipped with Anton Paar HTK 1200 N high-temperature oven chamber and temperature control system using Cu-Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in a scanning range of 2θ = 5−50°. Nitrogen sorption measurements were carried out at 77 K on a BEL-MAX gas/vapor adsorption instrument. The samples were evacuated at 300 °C for at least 6 h before adsorption. The t-plot method was used to determine the micropore volume. The specific surface was calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. CO-pulse adsorption on Micromeritics AutoChem II chemisorption analyzer was executed to estimate the dispersion of Pt in Pt-Sn-Beta-R or Pt-Si-Beta-R. Before adsorption, the samples (500 mg) were reduced in-situ in H2 flow (30 mL·min−1) at 500 °C for 1 h with a ramp rate of 5 °C·min−1 from room temperature to 500 °C. After the reduction treatment, the gas flow was switched to 30 mL·min−1 He stream for 30 min to completely remove the adsorbed H2 and then cooled to ~40 °C. Then a certain volume of CO injected every 1.5 min will be consumed continuously. This process was repeated until the peak was unchanged, indicating that the catalyst no longer consumes CO, so as to use the volume of CO consumption to characterize the metal dispersion. Pyridine-adsorbed FT-IR spectra were carried out on a Nicolet Nexus 670 FT-IR spectrometer with a resolution of 4 cm−1 in absorbance mode. The material (about 10 mg) was compressed into a self-supported wafer, which was then set in a quartz cell and sealed with CaF2 windows. The cell was connected to a vacuum system. After severely dehydration at 450 °C for 2 h, the wafer was exposed to pyridine vapor at room temperature for 30 min. The FT-IR spectra were collected after desorption at temperatures of 25–350 °C in vacuum. For the pyridine adsorption on Pt-Sn-Beta-R, the sample Pt-Sn-Beta-P was prepared by in-situ reduction before pyridine was dosed. In a typical experiment, the self-supported wafer (10 mg) of Pt-Sn-Beta-P was purged with 30 mL·min−1 He flow for 20 min in quartz cell. Then, the gas flow was switched to 20 mL·min−1 H2 stream (99.99% purity) and the sample was heated at a rate of 10 °C·min−1 to 500 °C, where the reduction was lasted for 40 min. After the reduction, the sample was cooled down to ambient temperature while purged with He flow. Then, the adsorption and desorption of pyridine was performed by taking the same process as mentioned above. CO-adsorbed FT-IR spectra in the 4000–400 cm−1 range were taken at room temperature on a Nicolet Nexus 670 FT-IR spectrometer with a resolution of 4 cm−1 in absorbance mode. The self-supported catalyst wafer (10 mg) was firstly activated at 500 °C under 30 mL·min−1 He flow for 30 min and then the sample was cooled down to ambient temperature, where the background spectrum was recorded. Thereafter, the sample was contacted with 30 mL·min−1 CO stream for 30 min and then CO-adsorbed spectrum was recorded. The gas flow was switched to 30 mL·min−1 He stream at room temperature for 30 min to completely eliminate physically adsorbed CO and a new spectrum was obtained. In order to simulate the real reaction state of catalyst, we also carried out an in-situ CO-adsorbed FT-IR study. The self-supported wafer of the catalyst precursor was set in a quartz tube. After purging with 30 mL·min−1 He flow for 30 min, the gas flow was switched to 20 mL·min−1 H2 stream. The sample was heated at a rate of 10 °C·min−1 to 500 °C, where the reduction was maintained for 40 min. After the reduction, the gas flow was switched to 30 mL·min−1 He stream to eliminate the adsorbed hydrogen completely and the sample was cooled down to ambient temperature. Then, the same process of adsorption and desorption of CO was performed as mentioned above. Thermogravimety analyses (TGA) were carried out on a Mettler TGA/SDTA 851e instrument with a ramping rate of 10 °C·min−1 in 50 mL·min−1 flowing gas of air. The Pt and Sn contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) on a Thermo IRIS Intrepid II XSP atomic emission spectrometer after dissolving the samples in HF solution. The TEM images and corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra were measured with a Tecnai F20 electron microscope. Cs-corrected HAADF-STEM images were taken on a JEM-ARM200F scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) operated at 300 kV. The XPS or in-situ XPS spectra of various samples were collected using AXIS SUPRA Imaging Photoelectron Spectrometer (Kratos Analytical Ltd.). 0.02 g powder of sample was pressed into a wafer with 3.95 mm diameter with a mould and held on the sample holder of the XPS instrument. The spectrum of the wafer was firstly measured without additional pretreatment (air-calcination and/or H2-reduction). The sample was introduced into UHV chamber for XPS measurement at room temperature. The sample was then transferred into the pretreatment chamber and treated under 20 mL·min−1 pure H2 or air at 500 °C for 1 h. The sample was then introduced into UHV chamber for XPS measurement at room temperatures. The X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (XAFS) Sn K-edge were collected at BL14W1 beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) while Pt L3-edge were collected at 1W1B beamline of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The data were collected in fluorescence mode using a Lytle detector while the corresponding reference sample were collected in transmission mode. The sample were grinded and uniformly daubed on the special adhesive tape. The acquired EXAFS data were processed according to the standard procedures using the ATHENA module of Demeter software packages. The EXAFS spectra were obtained by subtracting the post-edge background from the overall absorption and then normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step. Subsequently, the χ(k) data of were Fourier transformed to real (R) space using a hanning windows (dk = 1.0 Å-1) to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells. To obtain the quantitative structural parameters around central atoms, least-squares curve parameter fitting was performed using the ARTEMIS module of Demeter software packages. The following EXAFS equation was used:
the theoretical scattering amplitudes, phase shifts and the photoelectron mean free path for all paths calculated. S02 is the amplitude reduction factor, Fj(k) is the effective curved-wave backscattering amplitude, Nj is the number of neighbors in the jth atomic shell, Rj is the distance between the Xray absorbing central atom and the atoms in the jth atomic shell (backscatterer), λ is the mean free path in Å, ϕ j(k) is the phase shift (including the phase shift for each shell and the total central atom phase shift), σj is the Debye-Waller parameter of the jth atomic shell (variation of distances around the average Rj). The functions Fj(k), λ and ϕ j(k) were calculated with the ab initio code FEFF9. The additional details for EXAFS simulations are given below. All fits were performed in the R space with k-weight of 2 while phase correction was also applied in the first coordination shell to make R value close to the physical interatomic distance between the absorber and shell scatterer. The coordination numbers of model samples were fixed as the nominal values. The obtained S02 was fixed in the subsequent fitting. While the internal atomic distances R, Debye-Waller factor σ2, and the edge-energy shift Δ were allowed to run freely.
2.4. Catalytic Reaction.
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) was carried out in an atmospheric fixed-bed reactor. After pre-reduction at 500 °C for 2 h, a mixture gas of C3H8 and N2 (N2: C3H8 molar ratio = 19) was introduced to the reactor to start the PDH reaction at W/F ratio of 1.8 g·s·cm−3. The product analysis was performed on an online SHIMADZU-2014C GC, equipped with a flame ionization detector and HP-plot Q column. The product analysis was performed on an online SHIMADZU-2014C GC, equipped with a flame ionization detector and HP-plot Q column. The C3H8 conversion (X) and propylene selectivity (S) was calculated based on the following formulas:

Here, m is the weight of the feed or product, yC3H8 is the weight content of propane in the feed or product, yC3H6 is the weight content of propene in the product, and the subscripts f and p represent the feed and product, respectively.
Specially, in order to determine whether the by-product hydrogen was consumed and hydrogen equilibrium in the reaction process, we chose to off-line analyze all collected products including hydrogen by chromatography equipped with TCD and FID detectors.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preparation of Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta)
As shown in
Fig. 1
, the Pt supported Beta catalyst named as Pt-Sn-Beta-R was prepared by a simple wet impregnation of H2PtCl6 onto Sn-Beta (Si/Sn = 80) followed by a direct hydrogen reduction. No visible metal particles were found in the TEM image for the Pt-impregnated sample of Pt-Sn-Beta-P (
Fig. 2
A, S1A and S1B). After direct H2 reduction at 500 °C, the metal nanoparticles were also hardly observed in Pt-Sn-Beta-R sample under normal TEM mode at several different magnifications (
Fig. 2
B, S1C and S1D). However, all Pt species are collectively referred to as subnanometric clusters containing some atomically dispersed Pt species (yellow circle) and ultrafine Pt clusters (red circle) which clearly distinguished by Cs-correct HAADF-STEM viewed along the [0 1 0] and [0 0 1] directions of *BEA-type framework (
Fig. 2
, C and D). These Pt clusters (0.2–1.0 nm) are proposed to be encapsulated within the pore wall consisting of 4–6 MRs around the 12 MRs channel (as illustrated in the structural models below
Fig. 2
C and
Fig. 2
D) and/or in the 12 MR pore of the *BEA topology.

As control materials, the Pt-Si-Beta-R sample were prepared using all-silica Beta as the support and the Pt-Sn-Beta-CR sample were synthesized via a conventional calcination-reduction procedure following impregnation. For the Pt-Si-Beta-R sample, larger and heterogeneously distributed Pt NPs (3–20 nm) were detected on the external surface of zeolite crystals while only a hint of sub-nanoscale clusters inside the crystals after direct reduction (
Figs. S1
F and S1G), suggesting that the most Pt species failed to be trapped inside the all-silica Beta zeolite without the promotion of framework Sn atoms. The alternation of direct reduction to the traditional calcination-reduction process following the impregnation also resulted in aggregated Pt NPs outside the zeolite crystals. The Pt NPs already appeared after calcination (
Fig. S1
H) and they grew larger after the subsequent hydrogen reduction (
Figs. S1
I and S1J). Pt and Sn EDX mapping analysis on the Pt-Sn-Beta-R sample confirmed that the Pt and Sn atoms were evenly distributed within zeolite crystals (
Fig. 2
, G-J). The encapsulation of Pt subnanometric clusters in Pt-Sn-Beta-R were also supported by pulse CO chemisorption (
Fig. S2
) and N2 sorption (
Fig. S3
). The CO chemisorption indicated that Pt-Sn-Beta-R had a metal dispersion of >70%, much higher than that of Sn-free Pt-Si-Beta-R (26%). The different location of Pt species also led to the variations of textural properties (Table S1). Pt-Sn-Beta-R with the intracrystal metal species inside zeolite pores exhibited decreased surface area and pore volume (486 m2 g−1, 0.135 cm3 g−1) in comparison to the Sn-Beta precursor (501 m2 g−1, 0.144 cm3 g−1), possibly because the intracrystal encapsulation of Pt species induced partial pore jamming. Whereas for Pt-Si-Beta-R and Pt-Sn-Beta-CR, the support of platinum species hardly altered the pore volume, because the unconstrained metal particles located outside the crystals.
3.2. Special species due to strong interaction between framework-Sn and Pt
Bearing the above contrast results among Pt-Sn-Beta-R, Pt-Si-Beta-R, Pt-Sn-Beta-CR materials in mind, the critical role of framework Sn and the direct reduction process after impregnation was further explored. The strong interaction between tin and platinum has been frequently mentioned in previous reports, that is the anchoring effect of Sn to Pt
[21]
,
[22]
. In the present study, Sn-Beta zeolite was fast synthesized via a reconstruction method
[25]
to achieve high framework Sn content, which would provide enough anchors for guest Pt species. Framework Sn species in Sn-Beta comprise both “open site” (Si-O)3Sn(IV)–OH and “close site” (Si-O)4Sn(IV) species, which are in hexa-coordination and tetrahedral coordination, respectively
[25]
,
[26]
. As revealed by 119Sn NMR spectra (
Fig. 3
), the Sn coordination state of the support Sn-Beta changed from hexa-coordination to tetra-coordination after high temperature dehydration. The calcined material dehydrated at elevated temperature was used to load platinum subsequently. The tetra-coordinate “close site” in calcined support was readily transformed into the hexa-coordinate “open site” in the presence of water during the impregnation, also giving the resonance around −733 ppm in case of Pt-Sn-Beta-P
[25]
,
[26]
,
[27]
. Similar results were also observed in the UV–vis spectra (
Fig. S4
). After the hydrogen treatment at high temperature, the Sn state changed from a hydrous hexa-coordination to mainly tri-coordination (
Fig. 3
, peak around −280 ppm)
[27]
, probably ascribed to (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Pt. Based on the above results, the hydroxyl groups in the (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)–OH species was supposed to immobilize H2PtCl6 by forming monodispersed (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] − group, which was then directly reduced by hydrogen to form highly dispersed subnanometric Pt clusters strongly interacting with Sn via Pt-O-Sn bonds.

In attempts to provide more solid proof how Pt precursors interact with these framework Sn sites, their structural evolution during impregnation-reduction was monitored by XAFS study on Pt-Sn-Beta-P, Pt-Sn-Beta-R and their corresponding monometallic references (
Fig. 4
). For Pt-Sn-Beta-P, Pt4+ was obviously observed (
Fig. 4
A). The radial distance space spectra χ(R) (
Fig. 4
C) for the Pt L3-edge of Pt-Sn-Beta-P showed three peaks at around 1.93 and 2.20 in the first coordination shell and 3.30 Å in the second coordination shell. The scattering path position in first coordination shell of Pt-Sn-Beta-P corresponding to the scattering path positions of Pt-Cl bonds located at 2.20 Å in H2PtCl6 and Pt-O bonds located at 1.93 Å in PtO2 indicated the hybrid scattering path contribution by Pt-Cl and Pt-O bonds in Pt-Sn-Beta-P. The reasonable scattering path distance of Pt-O-Sn bonds located at 3.30 Å was also observed and no scattering path signal of Pt-Pt bonds at 2.86 Å in Pt foil was detected. Quantitative χ(R) space spectra fitting (
Fig. 5
, left) manifested that Pt-Sn-Beta-P displayed Pt-Cl bonding with the coordination number approaching 5.0 at 2.32 Å and Pt-O bonding with coordination number approaching 1.0 at 1.96 Å in the first coordination shell while Pt-O-Sn bonding with coordination number approaching 1.0 at 3.45 Å in the second coordination shell (for details see Table S2 in
Supplementary Material
s). Therefore, the existing atomically dispersed Pt species anchoring on the Sn-Beta zeolite in the form of Sn-(O)-[PtCl5] − for Pt-Sn-Beta-P sample can be verified. Combined with the result of hexa-coordination indicated by 119Sn MAS NMR, this specie is supposed to form by the reaction of the hydroxyl groups in the (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)–OH species with H2PtCl6 by forming monodispersed (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] − group.

As for Pt-Sn-Beta-R obtained after H2 treatment, both the shoulder peak located at 1.86 Å and prominent peak located at 2.16 Å were attribute to the scattering path of Pt-O bonds for Pt-Sn-Beta-R (for details see Table S2 in
Supplementary Material
s). In the Pt-Si-Beta-R, the hybrid scattering path contribution of Pt-O and Pt-Cl bonds can be clearly distinguished in the first coordination shell which were located at 1.88 and 2.26 Å respectively. The emergence of obvious scattering path of Pt-Pt bonds located at 2.65 and 2.71 Å for Pt-Sn-Beta-R and Pt-Si-Beta-R respectively in the second coordination shell strongly indicated the formation of Pt nanocluster with Pt0 metallic state. Comparing the scattering path intensity of Pt-Pt bonds, the Pt-Pt coordination number should be much higher in Pt-Si-Beta-R than Pt-Sn-Beta-R, suggesting the size of Pt nanocluster of Pt-Si-Beta-R was much larger than Pt-Sn-Beta-R, which was consistent with the TEM results above (Figs. 2 and S1). Combined with a shoulder peak located at 1.86 Å corresponding to scattering path of Pt-O bonds, the scattering path of Pt-O-Sn bonds located at 3.05 Å was enhanced and shortened for Pt-Sn-Beta-R corresponding to higher coordination number. Concretely, from Quantitative χ(R) space spectra fitting (

, left), the Pt-Sn-Beta-R displayed Pt-O bonding with coordination number approaching 3.0 at 2.21 Å in the first coordination shell, Pt-Pt bonding with coordination number approaching 3.0 at 2.69 Å in the second coordination shell, Pt-O-Sn bonding with coordination number approaching 3.0 at 3.18 Å in the third coordination shell. It should be kept in mind that the underestimation of Pt-Pt coordination number was also possible during the ex-situ measurement because of the inevitable partial oxidation of small Pt particles. Thus, it could be inferred that an ultrafine Pt cluster was composed of about four Pt atoms or above in average linked to Sn via Pt-O-Sn in Pt-Sn-Beta-R based on the statistical data. The Pt-Si-Beta-R displayed Pt-Cl bonding with coordination number approaching 4.0 at 2.23 Å and Pt-O bonding with coordination number approaching 5.0 at 1.82 Å in the first coordination shell while Pt-Pt bonding with coordination number approaching 8.0 at 2.76 Å in the second coordination shell without Pt-O-Sn bonding. These indicated that the smaller Pt nanocluster was still confined in the Sn-Beta zeolite pore through Pt-O-Sn bonds for Pt-Sn-Beta-R while the larger Pt nanocluster was on the outside of the Si-Beta crystal for Pt-Si-Beta-R zeolite. With respect to the structural evolution of Sn before and after reduction, the normalized X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) μ(E) spectra and the radial distance space spectra χ(R) for the Sn K-edge was also analyzed (for details see Table S2 in
Supplementary Material
s). As shown in
Fig. 4
B, compared with those references (Sn foil, SnO and SnO2) the Sn in the Pt-Sn-Beta-P showed an obvious oxidation state of Sn(IV), while a lower oxidation state of Sn(II) in Pt-Sn-Beta-R which means the Sn is partially reduced under H2 treatment protocol. The strong peak at 1.82 Å due to Sn-O bonding for Pt-Sn-Beta-P suggests a high coordination number (~6.0), while Sn-O-H bonding (peak at 2.53 Å) with coordination number approaching 2.0 in the second coordination shell. As for Pt-Sn-Beta-R, a lower Sn-O coordination number of 3.0 was observed (
Fig. 4
D, 5 and Table S2). This was also confirmed by solid-state 119Sn NMR spectrum of Pt-Sn-Beta-R with a wider Sn resonance band due to its complex Sn states of Sn(IV), Sn(II), Sn0 and the chemical shift at high field (~-280 ppm) with the 3-coordinate Sn(II) as the main species (
Fig. 3
)
[27]
. Scattering path of Sn-O-Pt bonds located at 3.33 Å in Pt-Sn-Beta-P and Pt-Sn-Beta-R can be observed with coordination number both approaching 1.0. This definitely confirmed the Pt atom was anchored on the Sn-Beta zeolite through Pt-O-Sn bonds in both Pt-Sn-Beta-P and Pt-Sn-Beta-R. No scattering path signal of Sn-Sn bonds (located at 3.14 Å) was observed, indicating the atomically dispersed Sn sites in Pt-Sn-Beta-P and Pt-Sn-Beta-R. Even more, the wavelet transforms of χ(k) vividly and intuitively demonstrated the local Pt and Sn coordination environment of various catalysts (
Fig. 5
, right).
In addition to the XAFS measurement presenting the overall information, this anchoring effect was also confirmed by the in-situ XPS spectra (
Fig. S7
). Although the impregnated samples of Pt-Si-Beta-P and Pt-Sn-Beta-P both showed characteristic Pt 4f peaks ascribed to the oxidation state Pt in H2PtCl6 (
Fig. S7
, a, d), Pt-Sn-Beta-P showed slightly higher binding energy by ~0.3 eV, indicating the presence framework Sn increased the electron density of Pt species
[28]
. In the Sn XPS spectra, the Sn 3d peaks shifted to the lower binding energy area compared to the Sn-Beta support after impregnation (
Fig. S7
B, c). However, these peak shifts disappeared once the Pt-Sn-Beta-P sample was calcined in air to decompose the Pt precursor species (
Fig. S7
B, d). The charge transfer from Sn to Pt was thought to be caused by isolate Sn-(O)-[PtCl5] − groups. For Sn-Beta-R or Pt-Sn-Beta-R sample undergoing hydrogen reduction (
Fig. S7
B, a, b, f), Sn species have been mostly transformed from Sn(IV) to Sn(II). From the results of Cs-correct HAADF-STEM, XAFS and fitting results, 119Sn MAS NMR, UV–vis and in-situ XPS, the specific Pt species in Pt-Sn-Beta-P and Pt-Sn-Beta-R are forcefully determined to be (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] − and (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=1~15), respectively, and a three-dimensional diagram with real structure shown in the

3.3. The evolution of Pt species of various catalysts during different preparation processes
To investigate the evolution of tin-induced Pt species during different preparation processes, a series of in-situ characterizations were performed. In-situ PXRD patterns of Pt-Sn-Beta-R upon H2 reduction at different temperatures showed that the crystallinity of Sn-Beta zeolite was well preserved, and more importantly, no detectable reflection corresponding to Pt nanoparticles (NPs) or PtxSny alloy NPs appeared even raising the reduction temperature up to 600 °C (
Fig. S8
). This indicated that the Pt metal species were highly dispersed and extremely tiny, in agreement with the results from TEM and CO chemisorption investigations. However, the Pt-Si-Beta-R sample showed two sharp diffraction peaks at 2θ = 39.8° and 46.2° attributed to the Pt metal after H2 reduction at 500 °C (
Fig. S9
), which already emerged even at 200 °C and became intensified due to the Ostwald ripening induced particle growth with the continuous increase of reduction temperature. To further ascertain the essential role of framework Sn, we have prepared the Pt-Sn-Si-Beta-P via the co-impregnation of H2PtCl6 and SnCl4·5H2O on Si-Beta zeolite (
Fig. S10
). After direct reduction in H2 flow, the PtxSny alloy were unambiguously formed. Once the removal of organic species and the reduction of Pt precursor were realized by a conventional calcination-reduction procedure, the reflections attributed to Pt NPs already appeared after the calcination at 200 °C and became more intense with the increase of the calcination temperature (
Fig. S11
). Upon the subsequent H2 reduction at high temperatures for the calcined Pt-Sn-Beta-C, the formation of PtxSny alloys was observed in Pt-Sn-Beta-CR (
Fig. S12
), indicating that the framework Sn atoms were possibly extracted due to the deconstruction of Beta zeolite induce by the formation of bulky Pt NPs and then participated in the formation of bimetal alloy

These samples were calcined by air or reduced by hydrogen at 500 °C in-situ. The dotted lines indicate the diffraction positions of Pt metal and PtxSny alloy NPs.
In-situ XPS spectra (
Figs. 8
and S7) and CO-adsorbed IR spectroscopy (
Fig. 9
) were used to demonstrated the change of electronic property and coordination structure of active species in the direct reduction or calcination-reduction process. In terms of XPS results, for Pt-Sn-Beta-R, the two weak peaks at 74.2 and 71.0 eV with the binding energy between those of Pt0 and Pt2+, was likely ascribed to subnanometric Pt clusters (containing atomically dispersed Pt and ultrafine Pt clusters) coordinated to the zeolite framework oxygen species (Ptδ+)
[30]
,
[31]
which is consistent with XAFS result. Upon calcination-reduction, most of Pt species in Pt-Sn-Beta-CR sample existed as alloyed Pt(Sn) (70.3 and 73.6 eV) corresponding to a new species with a higher binding energy than that of Sn0 in Sn 3d XPS spectrum (
Fig. 8
B, b), assigned to PtxSny alloy
[31]
, which were consistent with the PXRD investigation (
Fig. 7
, d). Similar to XAFS results, Pt of both oxides and metals was found in Sn-free Pt-Si-beta-R samples. In addition, it's worth noting that very few Sn0 species
[21]
,
[31]
was found for Pt-Sn-Beta-R (
Fig. 8
B, a), similar to the sample obtained by direct reducing Sn-Beta support (
Fig. 8
B, c), indicating that the framework Sn in Pt-Sn-Beta-R was hardly reduced to metallic state (Sn0) even after being strongly interacted with Pt species. This fact has been further confirmed by the well-preserved framework Sn-related Lewis acidity in the direct reduction process (
Fig. S13
).

A and the deconvolution results are summarized in Table S3. The band at 2097 cm−1 is likely assigned to the mononuclear Pt species coordinated to the framework oxygen species of zeolite support
[32]
,
[33]
. The bands at 2031 or 2037 cm−1 are possibly attributed to the encapsulated Pt clusters located in internal framework cavities.16Pt-Sn-Beta-R sample showed strong absorption bands at 2097 cm−1 and at 2031–2037 cm−1, which accounts for 12% and 66% of the population of Pt species based on the areas of the adsorption bands, respectively (
Fig. 9
A, a). This revealed that 78% of Pt species existed subnanometric clusters inside Beta zeolite. But for Pt-Sn-Beta-CR sample (
Fig. 9
A, b) prepared by calcination-reduction, a smaller proportion (55%) of Pt single atoms and confined Pt clusters were obtained, while a large proportion of Pt species existed as Pt NPs appearing on external surface of the crystal corresponding to an intense band at 2048 cm−1 due to the CO linearly adsorbed on the flat surface or kink sites of metallic Pt NPs
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
. Especially, for Pt-Si-Beta-R (

A, c), almost all the Pt species located on the outer surface of the support as Pt NPs. Meanwhile a broad band at around 1840 cm−1 (

3.4. Propane dehydrogenation over supported Pt catalysts
The catalytic performance of the supported Pt catalysts was investigated in PDH reaction, performed in an atmospheric fixed-bed reactor at 500 °C. Prior to the catalytic tests, the blank experiments, namely, the self-conversion of propane at high temperatures in the absence of a catalyst, were performed. These experiments would help to determine the true role of the catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
Fig. S15
indicates that the propane was almost impossible to be converted without catalyst, showing less than 2% of propane conversion at temperature as high as 600 °C. This result ascertains the catalytic role of supported Pt catalysts. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity over various catalysts as a function of time on stream (TOS) are shown in
Fig. 10
A and 10B, respectively and the results are also summarized in Table S4. The catalysts except Pt-Sn-Beta-CR showed similar initial conversion. However, the remarkable difference in deactivation behaviour was noticed among them. The propane conversions over Pt-Si-Beta-R and Pt-Sn-Beta-CR dropped by 50% in less than 10 h. Similar behaviour has been observed for the representative PDH catalyst of Pt/Al2O3 which was also served as a reference here. Surprisingly, the initial propane conversion over Pt-Sn-Beta-R was still maintained at TOS of 85 h and the selectivity of propylene in hydrocarbon products continuously increased even up to >99%. Meanwhile, equal molar of H2 to propene was confirmed by GC analysis as shown in
Fig.S16
and Table S5. Moreover, Pt-Sn-Beta-R exhibited the lowest coke deposition rate of 3.7 × 10−4 g gcat. −1h−1, which was an order of magnitude smaller in comparison to other catalysts (
Fig. S17
and Table S4). The PXRD patterns (
Fig. S18
) of the three fresh catalysts after pre-treatment under H2 atmosphere showed similar results as in-situ PXRD. For Pt-Sn-Beta-R, Pt particles did not sinter and remained highly dispersed after even 85 h of propane dehydrogenation at 500 °C which must be the reason for its long-term stability beneficial from the excellent spatially confined effect. However, for Pt-Si-Beta-R and Pt-Sn-Beta-CR after a short period of PDH reaction, the reflections attributed to Pt NPs or PtxSny alloy all became more intense with varying degrees due to the particle growth. Especially for Pt-Si-Beta-R catalyst without Sn, the confinement effect is extremely poor. The easy sintering of the Pt particles was likely responsible for the rapid deactivation for Pt-Si-Beta-R. For Pt-Sn-Beta-CR, the presence of the large PtxSny alloy might be responsible for the lowest initial activity and their aggregation under such high reaction temperature led to rapid inactivation. Despite having superior stability, the Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst showed lower TOF value than Pt-Si-Beta-R in the first 10 h as shown in
Fig. S19
, due to the higher adsorption barrier for propane on the Pt species strongly interacted by Sn atoms
[37]
,
[38]
. We also performed propane dehydrogenation tests on Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalysts at different temperatures, space velocities and lower N2/propane ratios as shown in
Fig. S20
. The results show that the decrease of propane conversion due to the increase of space velocity and propane partial pressure can be compensated by increasing the reaction temperature. At the same time, with the increase of reaction temperature, the stability of catalyst and propylene selectivity will be reduced, but fortunately the deactivation is not very fast.

Reaction conditions: pre-reduction at 500 °C in H2 flow for 2 h; 0.3 g catalyst loaded; W/F = 1.8 g·s·cm−3; N2: C3H8 molar ratio = 19; ambient pressure.
In order to study the long-term stability of the Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst, we prolonged the reaction time until the propane conversion was reduced by 10% (
Fig. 11
, point a) in comparison to the initial propane conversion and this period lasted for 410 h. The reaction temperature was then raised by 20 °C to recover the catalytic performance, which continued for another 250 h before the propane conversion dropped again by 10% (
Fig. 11
, point b). The deactivated catalyst was then subjected to an oxidative regeneration, and the PDH reaction went on for 140 h at 500 °C until the propane conversion dropped by 10%. Thus, the Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst was able to catalyze the PDH reaction steadily for nearly 800 h, indicative of a robust catalyst, and the two treatments, namely, increasing the reaction temperature and oxidation regeneration, could improve and recover the catalytic performance effectively.

Different treatments: (a) Raising the dehydrogenation temperature from 500 °C to 520 °C, and (b) oxidative treatment in air flow at 500 °C for 2 h.
The effects of platinum and tin contents on the catalytic performance of Pt-Sn-Beta-R in PDH reaction were further studied. The textural properties and element contents of these materials are shown in the
Fig. S22
and Table S5. A volcano shaped curve was observed between the Pt/Sn ratio and lifetime, determined by the duration time maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion, with the Pt content increased from 0.1% to 0.75% on the same Sn-Beta (Si/Sn = 80) support (
Fig. 12
, A, B and C). The Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst with the Pt/Sn molar ratio about 0.1 being the best one. When the Pt/Sn ratio was higher, no sufficient Sn atoms interacted with Pt atoms, leading to the inevitable sintering of the Pt particles during the H2 reduction process (
Fig. S23
A) and then fast deactivation in the PDH reaction. On the other hand, the effect of framework Sn amount on catalytic performance was also investigated by keeping Pt content at a constant amount of 0.375 wt% (
Fig. 12
, D, E and F). Similarly, an optimum Sn amount was also required to assure the best catalytic performance. Sufficient Sn amount was necessary to provide enough anchors for atomically dispersed Pt species or clusters inside zeolite (
Fig. S23
B). However, excess Sn amount led to difficulty in the crystallization of zeolite supports (
Fig. S21
, a, b) and poorer pore structure (
Fig. S24
). Meanwhile, the stronger Lewis acidity on Beta zeolite with higher Sn content resulted in more carbon deposition (
Figs. S25, S26
). These two obvious disadvantages may be responsible for the inferior catalytic performance.

Propane conversion and propylene selectivity of propane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Pt-Sn(80)-Beta-R with different Pt loadings (A, B) and different Si/Sn ratios (D, E) as a function of TOS at 500 °C.

Reaction conditions: pre-reduction at 500 °C in H2 flow for 2 h; 0.3 g catalyst loaded; W/F = 1.8 g·s·cm−3; N2: C3H8 molar ratio = 19; ambient pressure.
Taking into account of these results, we speculated that possible routes for propane dehydrogenation and carbon deposition (
Fig. 13
). For Pt supported on Sn-Beta zeolite with Lewis acidity, propane will inevitably produce methane, ethane and ethylene through cracking reaction (path II,
Fig. 13
) along with the main reaction path of dehydrogenation to propylene (path I,
Fig. 13
). In addition, propylene and ethylene may undergo further side reactions of cyclization or polymerization, leading to carbon deposition and deactivation of the catalyst (path III and IV,
Fig. 13
)
[39]
. According to the above catalytic results, such side reactions were more significant in the presence of large Pt. In contrast, Pt-Sn-Beta-R with subnanometric Pt clusters strongly interacting with the framework Sn significantly prohibited the side reactions, showing ultra-high propylene selectivity and the lowest coke deposition rate.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have succeeded in confining subnanometric Pt clusters (single atoms and ultrafine clusters) within crystals of Sn-Beta zeolite with the framework Sn-assisted host-guest interaction to form isolated monodispersed Pt precursor species. The major challenge in this strategy is to largely avoid the expulsion of framework Sn which is fulfilled by a direct reduction of the impregnated H2PtCl6 precursor without undergoing calcination. We used XAFS, 119Sn NMR, in-situ XPS and other methods to confirm that the precursor species (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] − generated by skeleton-Sn induced anchoring is the key to prepare subnanometric Pt clusters in the form of (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=1~15) confined within zeolite pores wall. The catalyst with encapsulated Sn-associated subnanometric Pt clusters showed super low-temperature activity for propane dehydrogenation (propane conversion of 47% at 500 °C), ultra-high selectivity of propene (>99%) and excellent stability (maintaining more than 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h). This finding is of broad interests in utilization of heteroatom-containing zeolites as a novel support for highly dispersed metal catalysts.
