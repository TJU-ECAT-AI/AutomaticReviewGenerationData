Abstract
Anti-sintering platinum-based catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is promising to avoid corrosive oxychlorination re-dispersion of sintered Pt during coke combustion. Herein, we report an anti-sintering Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst and optimizations on its activity for PDH with group IB metals (Cu, Ag and Au). Using a suite of characterizations including BET, H2 chemisorption, XRD, STEM, CO-DRIFTs, XANES, XPS, TG/DTA, TPO, C3H6-TPD and TPSR of C3H6 with H2, we reveal that Cu and Ag dilute the surface Pt atoms and donate electron to Pt while the case for Pt-Au is inverse. As a result, significant enhancements in propane conversion and propylene selectivity were obtained on the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 catalysts. The Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 exhibited excellent C3H6 yield and regeneration stability, presumably due to the formation of intermetallic compounds and little phase segregation during cyclic dehydrogenation-regeneration runs.

1. Introduction
Production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn renewed attention with increasing propane supply from vast exploration of shale gas
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
. PDH is a highly endothermic reaction so that high reaction temperature (>550 °C) is essential for high propane conversion
[4]
. However, high temperature also favors undesired reactions, such as cracking, hydro-cracking and coking which result in low propylene selectivity
[3]
. Supported platinum based catalysts are highly active for PDH while susceptible to deactivation by coke deposition
[5]
. Frequent regenerations of deactivated catalyst by coke combustion are required in practice during which irreversible sintering of highly dispersed Pt species occurs under the high-temperature and oxidizing conditions
[6]
,
[7]
. Oxychlorination is usually adopted to re-disperse the sintered Pt particles while which causes severe equipment corrosion
[8]
. Thus, anti-sintering Pt based catalyst that is stable during cyclic coke combustion and no need of oxychlorination regeneration is highly desired as coke deposition seems thermodynamically inevitable under PDH operation conditions
[5]
.
Extensive efforts on optimizing support materials and modulating electronic property of Pt have been performed to improve the catalyst’s stability and propylene selectivity. Based on the discovery that coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ centers are anchoring sites for Pt

, Shi et al.

prepared raft-like Pt-Sn clusters over pentacoordinate Al3+ ions rich Al2O3 nanosheet that exhibits much better durability than conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst under relatively low propane partial pressure. By introducing Pt during the synthesis of γ-Al2O3 via sol-gel chemistry, Im et al.
[7]
constructed partially entrapped Pt@γ-Al2O3 structure which has improved regeneration stability in twenty consecutive regeneration cycles. Confining Pt in the channels of Na-[Fe]ZSM5 zeolite built selective and stable catalyst for dehydrogenation of diluted propane
[11]
. Doping Al2O3 with Mg or Zn and forming MgAl2O4 or ZnAl2O4 spinel enhances the capability of stabilizing Pt during PDH reactions,
[12]
,
[13]
presumably because the formation of epitaxial lattice matched metal-oxide interfacial structure at (1 1 1) between Pt and spinel
[14]
,
[15]
,
[16]
. Sn is a typical additive that can increase Pt dispersion by forming Pt-Sn alloy
[17]
and can also serve as nucleation sites to redisperse sintered Pt during regeneration process
[6]
. Some oxides like CeO2 and PdO are able to trap volatile PtO2 at high temperatures, benefiting the stabilization and regeneration of Pt
[18]
,
[19]
. In addition to serving as structural stabilizers, the additives, such as Sn
[6]
,
[20]
, Ga
[2]

[21]
and Zn
[22]
,
[23]
, also modulate the electronic properties of Pt to improve the propylene selectivity when they are in metallic state and forming alloy with Pt
[24]
,
[25]
. Group IB metals (Cu, Ag and Au) which have much stronger metallic character are also candidates as modulators
[26]
. Han et al.
[27]
presented that Cu can well interact with Pt and improve the propylene selectivity of Pt/Al2O3 by weakening the adsorption of propylene on Pt. Different electronic modulating effects of group IB metals have been demonstrated on Pd which indeed adjusted the adsorption strength of ethylene
[28]
,
[29]
. With our recent advance in improving the stabilization efficiency of Pt over MgAl2O4,
[14]
,
[15]
further modulating the electronic property of anti-sintering Pt/MgAl2O4 would be promising for constructing highly durable and selective PDH catalysts.
In this work, we report the preparation of highly stable and active PDH catalysts by integrating the stabilization capability of MgAl2O4 and the electronic modulation effect of group IB metals on Pt. We demonstrated that the Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst indeed exhibited excellent regeneration stability during cyclic dehydrogenation-regeneration operations albeit the propylene selectivity was inferior. With addition of Cu, Ag and Au, the stable yields of propylene are all improved with the propylene selectivity in an order of Pt-Cu > Pt-Ag > Pt > Pt-Au. Meanwhile, the regeneration stability is further enhanced after group IB metals modification, especially for Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 sample. We further provide insight on the influence of group IB metals on the catalyst structure and catalytic behaviour by using a suite of characterization techniques.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.1.1. Synthesis of Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts
MgAl2O4 support was prepared by hydrolysis of aluminum isopropoxide with magnesium nitrate hexahydrate in ethanol as previously reported
[14]
. γ-Al2O3 (>99.5%) was purchased from Shandong Aluminum Industry. Incipient wetness impregnation method was adopted for the catalyst preparation. 3.0 g of MgAl2O4 or γ-Al2O3 was impregnated in aqueous H2PtCl6⋅6H2O (>99.99%, Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Technologies Co., Ltd) solution containing Pt of 0.030 g under room temperature for 24 h. Impregnated samples were dried at 60 °C overnight and then calcined in ambient air at 500 °C for 5 h with a heating rate of 5 oC·min−1. Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were obtained after reduction of the calcined samples in flowing H2 at 600 °C for 2 h.
2.1.2. Synthesis of M/MgAl2O4 (M = Cu, Ag and Au) and Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts
M/MgAl2O4 (M = Cu, Ag and Au) catalysts with 1 wt% were also prepared for comparison via the same procedures to preparing Pt/MgAl2O4. The precursors are Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (>99.5%, Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Technologies Co., Ltd), AgNO3 (>99.8%, Tianjin Tiangan Chemical Reagent Technologies Co., Ltd) and HAuCl4·4H2O (>99.99%, Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Technologies Co., Ltd), respectively. Incipient wetness co-impregnation method was applied for the synthesizing Pt-M/MgAl2O4 (M = Cu, Ag and Au) catalysts by using H2PtCl6·6H2O/Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (>99.99%, Alfa Aesar)/AgNO3 and H2PtCl6·6H2O/HAuCl4·4H2O as corresponding precursors. The nominal weight loadings of Pt and M were both 1.0 wt% and the real contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Similar impregnation and thermal treatment procedures to preparing Pt/MgAl2O4 were conducted to synthesize Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Surface areas were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 using N2 adsorption isotherms and BET analysis method. All of the samples were degassed under vacuum at 300 °C for 5 h before the adsorption measurements.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a PANalytical PW3040/60 X′ Pert PRO diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15432 nm), operating at 40 kV and 40 mA.
The actual contents of the metals in these samples were determined by using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) on an IRIS intrepid II XSP instrument (Thermo Electron Corporation).
High resolution TEM analysis was performed using a JEOL JEM-2100F operated at 200 keV with a specified point-to-point resolution of 0.19 nm and a lattice resolution of 0.10 nm. This instrument is equipped with a high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) detector and the resolution is 0.2 nm. TEM specimens were prepared by depositing a suspension of the powdered sample on a lacey carbon-coated copper or nickel (for cupper containing samples) grid. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed by an Oxford Instruments ISIS/INCA energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system with an Oxford Pentafet Ultrathin Window (UTW) Detector in HAADF-STEM mode.
Pt dispersions were measured by pulse adsorption of H2 on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 automated characterization system at 50 °C. Approximately 50 mg of the sample was loaded in a U-shaped quartz tube and heated to 600 °C for 30 min under pure H2 of 30 mL·min−1, and then switched to pure Ar of 30 mL·min−1 for 1 h before cooled to 50 °C. H2 pulse (10 vol% H2/Ar) was introduced by switching the six-way valve. Pt dispersions were estimated by assuming the adsorption stoichiometry of H2 to Pt to be 0.5.
IR spectra were collected in a diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) mode using a Bruker EQUINOX 55 spectrometer, equipped with an MCT detector and operated at a resolution of 4 cm−1 for 64 scans. Before each experiment, the sample (∼40 mg) was reduced in situ in pure H2 at 500 °C in a DRIFTs cell (HC-500, Pike technologies). Then under flowing He, the temperature was cooled to 30 °C and hold for 60 min. After that, a background spectrum was recorded for the sample, which was then subtracted automatically from the subsequent spectra. The corresponding gas for CO adsorption (10 vol% CO/He) was introduced into the reaction cell consequently and the spectrum was recorded as a function of time until saturation. He was then switched on to purge the gaseous CO. All the total flow rates involved were 20 mL·min−1.
X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Pt L3-edge was collected at the beamline 14 W of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) in China. The output beam was selected by Si(1 1 1) monochromator. Energy calibration was undertaken by using Pt foil. The spectra were recorded at room temperature under the fluorescence mode with a solid-state detector. Prior to the experiments, the samples were reduced at 600 °C for 2 h. After it was cooled to room temperature, the reactor was evacuated and transferred to the glove box without exposure to air. Then, all of the samples were sealed in Kapton films in the glove box. The Athena software package was used for the data analysis.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected using a Thermofisher ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) and an applied power of 150 W. C1s (binding energy 284.6 eV) was used as the reference.
Thermal gravity (TG) analysis was performed on a TGA Q600 (TA Instruments). Approximately 15 mg of sample was placed in an alumina crucible and heated at a rate of 10 °C·min−1 in air atmosphere (flow rate: 100 mL·min−1) up to 850 °C.
Raman spectra of the spent catalysts were collected on a LabRAM HR 800 Raman spectrometer with a 532 cm−1 Ar-ion laser beam. Data acquisition was conducted with exposure time of 10 s and 5 accumulations.
Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of adsorbed C3H6 with H2 experiments were performed on Micromeritics Auto Chem II 2920 apparatus equipped with on-line mass spectroscopy (Cirrus II, MKS). Typically, 100 mg catalyst was pretreated under H2 at 600 °C for 1 h and then purged with He for 1 h. C3H6 adsorption was conducted by flowing C3H6 (99.99 vol%, 20 mL·min−1) through the catalyst bed at 50 °C for 0.5 h. After purging with He for 0.5 h, 10 vol% H2/He was introduced and the temperature was elevated to 800 °C at a rate of 10 oC·min−1. The signals of H2 (m/z = 2), C3H6 (m/z = 42), C3H8 (m/z = 44), C2H4 (m/z = 28), C2H6 (m/z = 30) and CH4 (m/z = 16) were monitored during experiments.
C3H6 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) analysis was performed on HIDEN ANALYTICAL CATLAB (CATLAB-A7, Hiden Analytical) at atmospheric pressure. Typically, 100 mg catalyst was pretreated under H2 at 600 °C for 1 h and then purged with He for 1 h before cooling to 50 °C. C3H6 (99.99 vol%, 20 mL·min−1) was then introduced on the catalysts at 50 °C for 0.5 h and purged with He for 0.5 h. C3H6 TPD analysis was performed under He with temperature rate of 10 oC·min−1 and the signals of H2 (m/z = 2), C3H6 (m/z = 42), C3H8 (m/z = 44), C2H4 (m/z = 28) and C2H6 (m/z = 30) were collected.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments were carried out on Micromeritics Auto Chem II 2920 apparatus equipped with on-line mass spectroscopy (Cirrus II, MKS). The spent catalysts were pretreated at 150 °C for 1 h in He to remove adsorbed moisture. After cooling down to 50 °C, the samples were then heated from 50 °C to 850 °C in 2 vol% O2/He at a rate of 10 oC·min−1. The signals of O2 (m/z = 32), CO2 (m/z = 44), CO (m/z = 28) and H2O (m/z = 18) were collected.
2.3. Catalytic reactions
The catalysts were assessed under both kinetic reaction conditions and near practical reaction conditions with negligible heat and mass transport limitations (see
supporting information
). The propane conversions were controlled below 10% and about 30% for kinetic reaction and near practical reaction operation, respectively. Propane dehydrogenation reactions were carried out in a U-shaped quartz reactor (i.d. = 10 mm or 4 mm,
Table S1
). Catalyst (∼300 mg, 20–40 mesh) was diluted by 3.0 g of quartz sand and was held at the bottom of the reactor between two layers of quartz wool. A k-type thermocouple lined in a thin quartz tube was inserted into the catalyst bed to control and measure the temperature within the vertical isothermal zone. The catalysts were reduced by hydrogen at 600 °C for 2 h prior to the catalytic reaction. After cooling to 580 °C, reactant gas mixture (47.5 vol% C3H8, 47.5 vol% H2 and 5 vol% Ar as internal standard gas) was introduced through the catalytic bed at 40 mL·min−1 and the propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSVC3H8, grams of propane fed per gram of catalyst per hour) is 6.8 h−1. Cyclic dehydrogenation-regeneration operations were conducted to evaluate the regeneration stability. After PDH reaction at 580 °C for 8 h, the spent catalyst was regenerated by burning coke at 650 °C using flowing air (100 mL·min−1) for 3 h and H2 reduction at 600 °C for 1 h. The reactants and products were analysized using gas chromatograph (Echrom A90) equipped with Hayesep Q packed column and a TCD detector. The conversion of propane (XC3H8), selectivities of the products (SCxHy: SC3H6, SC2H6, SC2H4, and SCH4), propylene yield (YC3H6), turnover frequency (TOF) of propane and formation rate of methane normalized to the surface atoms of Pt (RateCH4) (in kinetic regime, XC3H8 < 10%) were calculated using the following equations:

3. Results
3.1. Catalytic performance and regeneration stability of Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/MgAl2O4
Fig. 1
a shows propane conversion and selectivity toward propylene over the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts during eight consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration operations. The Pt/Al2O3 exhibits decreasing XC3H8 from 29.5% to 24.0% in the first 8-h dehydrogenation run with SC3H6 increasing from 72.9% to 84.1%. After the first regeneration, the XC3H8 was only recovered to 25.8% and then decreased to 19.2% while the SC3H6 increased from 82.2% to 90.5%. In the following dehydrogenation runs, the recovered initial XC3H8 keeps decreasing (5th, 14.1%; 8th, 8.7%) while SC3H6 reaches a plateau (∼90%). These results represent the deactivations of conventional Pt/Al2O3 catalyst caused by coking during dehydrogenation and sintering during regeneration
[5]
,
[6]
. The Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst exhibits XC3H8 in the range of 31.1–23.4% and SC3H6 of 65.6–76.8% during the first 8-h dehydrogenation run. In contrast to the Pt/Al2O3, the recovered XC3H8 increase while SC3H6 decrease significantly in the following runs. The XC3H8 are in ranges of 37.0–27.0%, 34.8–23.9% and 28.6–20.7% and the SC3H6 are 52.2–67.9%, 50.6–67.1% and 53.3–66.3% during the 2nd, 5th and 8th run, respectively. As CC ruptures are the dominant side reactions, methane and ethane are the major byproducts and ethylene is minor over these two catalysts due to hydrogenation with H2 (
Fig. S1
). On both catalysts, the SCH4 are comparable to the SC2H6 in the first three runs and then become larger and larger than the SC2H6 in the rest runs, indicating that catalytic deep cracking capability of the catalysts was enhanced after cyclic regenerations.
Fig. 1
b displays the yields of C3H6 which are in ranges of 21.5–20.2%, 12.9–8.5% and 7.8–5.0% for the Pt/Al2O3 in the 1st, 5th and 8th run while the corresponding ones for the Pt/MgAl2O4 are 20.4–18.0%, 17.6–16.0% and 15.2–13.7%, respectively. The D.P.% of the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/MgAl2O4 in the 2nd, 5th and 8th run are 25.6%, 34.9%, and 35.4%, and 27.1%, 30.6% and 27.6%, respectively, while the accumulated deactivation parameters in the whole 8 runs are 81.0% and 33.6%, respectively. It indicates that deactivations caused by coke deposition in each run are similar over the two catalysts, but deactivations caused by Pt sintering after 8 regenerations are significantly different. Obviously, the Pt/MgAl2O4 has much better regeneration stability than the conventional Pt/Al2O3.

After each PDH run, the catalyst was regenerated by burning coke at 650 °C in flowing air for 3 h and then by H2 reduction at 600 °C for 1 h.
3.2. Effect of group IB metals on Pt/MgAl2O4 for PDH
Fig. 2
a displays the XC3H8 and SC3H6 for PDH over the Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt-M/MgAl2O4 at 580 °C during the 24-h test. The Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4, Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Au/MgAl2O4 exhibit XC3H8 in ranges of 25.7–21.0%, 30.6–16.7% and 33.7–16.6% and SC3H6 in ranges of 87.5–93.1%, 85.1–95.0% and 60.0–88.2%, respectively. Comparing to the Pt/MgAl2O4 whose XC3H8 and SC3H6 are 30.9–14.2% and 65.8–92.6%, respectively, all Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts show higher stable XC3H8 (except in the first 2 h for the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4) and the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 catalysts have much higher SC3H6. As a result, the YC3H6 over the Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts are in ranges of 22.5–19.6%, 26.1–15.9% and 20.2–14.7% when M is Cu, Ag and Au, respectively (
Fig. 2
b). They are all higher than that of Pt/MgAl2O4 (20.3–13.2%). Notably, Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 displays the highest initial YC3H6 but the fastest decreasing rate while the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 exhibits the most stable YC3H6. The major byproducts are also methane and ethane for the Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts (
Fig. 3
). The SCH4 and SC2H6 over the catalysts both are in an order of Pt-Au > Pt > Pt-Cu > Pt-Ag. The SC2H4 are minor over the catalysts, which are only ∼2% over the Pt-Au/MgAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 and ∼1% over the Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 catalysts. As the M/MgAl2O4 counterparts only exhibit negligible XC3H8 (<3%) which are similar to those for the support materials (Al2O3 and MgAl2O4) and even quartz sands (
Table S2
), Pt undoubtedly act as the only active metal and the group IB metals play the roles of electronic modulators. Obviously, Cu and Ag remarkably enhanced CH cleavage and suppressed CC rupture reactions over Pt/MgAl2O4, while Au promoted both.

We further evaluated the catalytic performance and regeneration stabilities of the Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration operations. As shown in
Fig. 4
a, the XC3H8 and SC3H6 in the 1st 8-h dehydrogenation are significantly different from those in the following runs for the three Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts, indicating that dramatic structural changes occur during the first regeneration process. The Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 exhibits good regeneration stability although slowly deactivation caused by coking still occurs in each PDH run. The XC3H8 are in ranges of 28.4–25.0%, 27.4–23.3% and 26.2–21.9% in the 2nd, 5th and 8th run, respectively, displaying the D.P.% of 12.0%, 14.8% and 16.3%. The corresponding SC3H6 are in ranges of 81.4–88.6%, 81.3–89.5% and 82.6–90.5%. As a result, the YC3H6 are in ranges of 23.1–22.1%, 22.3–20.8% and 21.6–19.8%, respectively (
Fig. 4
b). The Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 shows XC3H8 in ranges of 23.7–20.1%, 19.1–15.8% and 16.1–13.5% in the 2nd, 5th and 8th run and D.P.% of 15.3%, 17.4% and 15.6% while the SC3H6 all in ∼92–95%. The YC3H6 decrease significantly from ranges of 21.9–19.1% to 17.8–15.0% and 14.9–12.8% in the 2nd, 5th and 8th run, displaying gradual catalyst deactivations with regenerations. As for Pt-Au/MgAl2O4, significant XC3H8 decrease and SC3H6 increase appear with regenerations and also in each run. In the 2nd, 5th and 8th run, the XC3H8 are 41.0–29.8%, 35.9–24.3% and 30.9–20.7% and the D.P.% are 27.5%, 31.8% and 33.0% the SC3H6 are 44.2–61.4%, 48.2–67.6% and 53.1–69.4%, respectively. However, the YC3H6 decrease slightly from ranges of 18.1–18.3% to 17.3–16.4% and 16.4–14.4%. The selectivities for the byproducts over the catalysts in consecutive runs, such as methane, ethane and ethylene, also changed according to the evolutions of SC3H6 as shown in
Fig. S2
. The initial XC3H8 and YC3H6 for the catalysts after regeneration could reflect the recovery on the catalytic performance without influence of coke deposition. According to
Table S3
, the initial XC3H8 and YC3H6 are comparable over the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 while keep decreasing over the Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4. However, over the Pt-Au/MgAl2O4 catalyst, the initial XC3H8 are comparable while the initial YC3H6 are decreasing.

3.3. Structure characterizations
3.3.1. Anti-sintering properties of Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/MgAl2O4
The sizes of Pt in the fresh and spent Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts were characterized by XRD and HAADF-STEM techniques. As shown in
Fig. 5
a, besides the X-ray diffractions for MgAl2O4 spinel (PDF#00-021-1152) and γ-Al2O3 (PDF#00-002-1420), diffraction peak for Pt (1 1 1) at 2θ = 39.8° (PDF#00-004-0802) is distinct for the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3-spent while negligible for the Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4-spent. According to Scherrer equation, the mean size of Pt for the Pt/Al2O3-spent was estimated to be 10.4 nm (
Table 1
). In the HAADF-STEM images shown in

, both the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/MgAl2O4 display highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles with mean sizes of 1.6 ± 0.3 and 1.4 ± 0.3 nm, respectively. After eight consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration runs, parts of the Pt particles in the Pt/Al2O3-spent are about 9.0 ± 4.0 nm and some of them are >20 nm. In contrast, most of the Pt nanoparticles retain the small sizes of 1.6 ± 0.3 nm besides very rare of the Pt particles are about 10 nm in the Pt/MgAl2O4-spent, clearly indicating the great enhancement on the stability of Pt nanoparticles by using MgAl2O4 as support. In line with the changes in Pt sizes, the dispersion of Pt for the Pt/Al2O3-spent sharply decreased to 9.5% from the high initial dispersion of 57.9%, while that for the Pt/MgAl2O4-spent retained at 59.4% with only slight decrease comparing to the initial dispersion of 64.1% (
Table 1
). The surface areas of the Pt/Al2O3-spent and Pt/MgAl2O4-spent are 153.7 and 113.5 m2·g−1, respectively, which are both decreased a little bit from the initial ones as 218.7 and 157.1 m2·g−1. Obviously, the little change in Pt size and dispersion of the Pt/MgAl2O4 are responsible for its excellent regeneration stability.

3.3.2. Modulations of group IB metals to Pt in geometric structure and electronic property
The XRD patterns of the Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts are shown in
Fig. 5
b. With co-impregnation of group IB metals with Pt, the initial dispersing extents of Pt in the Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts change little as no diffraction peaks for Pt are visible like that for the Pt/MgAl2O4. Distinct diffraction peaks of Ag and Au respectively appear in the XRD patterns of the Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Au/MgAl2O4, while diffraction peaks for Cu are not detectable in the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4, indicating that not all Ag and Au are highly dispersed like Pt and Cu after co-impregnation. Based on the diffraction peaks of Ag (1 1 1) and Au (1 1 1) at 37.9° and 38.2°, the sizes of Ag and Au particles were estimated to be 13.9 and 37.2 nm by using Scherrer equation (
Table 1
). The particle sizes of the metals that are undetectable by XRD are characterized by STEM. As shown in
Fig. 7
a–c and insets, all the Pt-M/MgAl2O4 samples display small metal particles with sizes of 1.4–1.6 nm besides some large particles in the Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Au/MgAl2O4 which were identified to be Ag and Au by EDS analysis, respectively. EDS mappings on the Pt-M/MgAl2O4 samples in the same areas imaged in
Fig. 7
a–c show that the locations of Cu, Ag and Au are overlapped with that of Pt, implying the close proximities between Pt and M. The corresponding weight ratios of Pt to M (M = Cu, Ag and Au) in these areas by EDS analysis are estimated to be 1.4, 5.2 and 3.2, respectively. Notably, the ratios are various for individual particles, evidencing the formation of Pt-M bimetallic particle with random compositions (
Fig. S4
) The better co-dispersion of Cu with Pt than that of Ag and Au could lie in the fact that Cu can form intermetallic compounds (PtCu3 and/or PtCu) with Pt while Au and Ag are partially sintered on MgAl2O4 and only form solid solutions with very low solubility of Pt

As for the spent catalysts, there were still no detectable diffractions for Pt and Cu in the XRD pattern for the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4-Spent, indicating both metals retain high dispersions and small sizes (
Fig. 5
b). For the Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4-Spent, the diffraction peak of Ag (1 1 1) at 37.9° became invisible while a tiny peak at 38.6 appeared, showing AgPty (y < 1) bimetallic nanoparticles with size of 6.0 nm. The diffraction peak centered at 39.7° which slightly shifted from the Pt (1 1 1) of 39.8° could be attributed to the (1 1 1) of PtAgx (x < 1) bimetallic nanoparticles. The size is estimated to be 10.5 nm. Similarly, the Pt-Au/MgAl2O4-Spent exhibited diffraction peaks for the (1 1 1) of Au rich AuPty (y < 1) at 38.6° and that of Pt rich PtAux (x < 1) at 39.7°,
[32]
as these two peaks located at diffraction angles between Au (1 1 1) and Pt (1 1 1) (
Fig. S3
). The sizes of AuPty and PtAux were estimated to be 21.6 and 10.9 nm, respectively. In the STEM images of spent catalysts shown in
Fig. 8
, metal nanoparticles in small sizes of 1.5–1.6 nm are also evident with high particle density for all the Pt-M/MgAl2O4-Spent catalysts like that of the Pt/MgAl2O4-Spent catalyst. Large metal particles were also found on the Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4-Spent and Pt-Au/MgAl2O4-Spent but not on the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4-Spent. The XRD and STEM results clearly demonstrate that the small sizes of metal nanoparticles can also be highly retained in the Pt-M/MgAl2O4. EDS mappings on the Pt-M/MgAl2O4-Spent samples show that the locations of Cu, Ag and Au are still overlapped with that of Pt, implying that Pt species are coexisted with the second metals (M = Cu, Ag, Au) in different extents even after 8 regeneration-dehydrogenation cycles. (
Fig. 8
) The corresponding weight ratios of Pt to M (M = Cu, Ag and Au) in these areas by EDS analysis are estimated to be 1.7, 1.7 and 5.1, respectively. EDS analysis on individual particles shown in
Fig. S4
further confirms the coexistence of Pt and M. The Pt dispersions over the Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts can also be determined by using H2 chemisorption since there was no detectable H2 chemisorption over the monometallic M/MgAl2O4 counterpart samples
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
. As listed in
Table 1
, the Pt dispersions for the fresh Pt-Cu, Pt-Ag and Pt-Au/MgAl2O4 catalysts are 26.2%, 33.2% and 76.9%, respectively. Notably, the former two are significantly lower while the last is much higher than that for the Pt/MgAl2O4 (64.1%), suggesting that Pt is surface poor on Pt-Cu and Pt-Ag while is surface rich on Pt-Au bimetallic nanoparticles as the mean sizes of the Pt-M bimetallic nanoparticles are similarly small. Such surface compositions of bimetallic nanoparticles are a result of multiple influencing factors, including the surface energy of each metal and the corresponding oxide and the treatments atmospheres
[36]
,
[37]
. In the spent catalysts, the corresponding Pt dispersions decreased slightly, which are 25.1%, 23.5% and 73.9%, respectively. The high stability may originate from the stabilization capability of MgAl2O4 spinel on small Pt nanoparticles as the spent Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst retained small nanoparticles of 1.6 nm and Pt dispersion of 59.4%. Cyclic reaction-regeneration operations make Pt-M nanoparticles undergoing reducing-oxidizing cycles involving formation of metallic Pt-M alloy and transformation to PtMOx. With the formation of stable Pt-MgAl2O4 interface, the readily formed CuO and Ag2O would expose outside the PtMOx particles and remain outside the bimetallic nanoparticles after reduction. Such dynamic transformation looks significantly different from the re-dispersion of Pt in typical Pt-Sn/Al2O3 through forming highly dispersed Pt islands supported by Sn oxides
[38]
. The difference in the surface concentration of Pt over the bimetallic nanoparticles undoubtedly would modulate their geometric structures and electronic properties.

X-ray adsorption spectra (XAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected to determine the oxidation states of Pt in the Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts.
Fig. 9
shows the normalized X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra at Pt L3-edge for the catalysts and the reference spectra of Pt foil and PtO2 powder. Obviously, the intensities of the white lines of Pt in the catalysts are all slightly higher than that of Pt foil while far below that of PtO2 powder, implying that Pt are all partially positively charged in the catalysts as the intensity of white line indicates the oxidation state
[25]
,
[39]
. Notably, the intensities of the white lines of Pt in the catalysts are in an order of Pt-Au > Pt > Pt-Ag > Pt-Cu. If assuming the Pt white line intensity in Pt/MgAl2O4 indicates the electron donation extent of Pt to MgAl2O4 support, it could conclude that Pt denote electron to Au while receive electron from Ag and Cu according to the relative white line intensities. Considering the electronegativities of Au, Pt, Ag and Cu are 2.54, 2.28, 1.93 and 1.90, respectively,
[40]
it seems that electron transfer from the metal of lower electronegativity to the metal of higher electronegativity. Notably, Pt in the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 is the closest to the metallic Pt due to the maximum donation of electron from Cu. The electron transfer behaviors among Pt and support and M metals were also reflected by XPS data. As shown in
Fig. 10
, with careful deconvolution from the overlapped peaks of Pt 4f and Al 2p, the binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 in the Pt/MgAl2O4 is 71.3 eV, which is slightly larger than that of metallic state of Pt (71.0 eV)
[41]
. The binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 in the Pt-Cu, Pt-Ag and Pt-Au/MgAl2O4 are 71.1, 71.2 and 71.5 eV, respectively. The trend of binding energies of Pt is in line with that in the intensities of Pt white lines. The electron transfer from Pt to Au and from Cu to Pt can be confirmed by the binding energy decrease of Au 4f7/2 (83.5 eV vs 84.0 eV) and increase of Cu (952.7 eV vs 952.4 eV) comparing to the corresponding metallic states (
Fig. S5
)
[42]
,
[43]
. It should be noted that Ag is a special metal of lowered binding energy in the oxidized state
[44]
. Thus, the fact that the Ag 3d3/2 of 373.9 eV in the Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 is smaller than the metallic one (374.3 eV) also supports the donation of electron from Ag to Pt

In situ DRIFTs of CO adsorptions were carried out to explore the electronic property of surface Pt atoms and the surface compositions of the catalysts. As shown in
Fig. 11
, the Pt/MgAl2O4 displays three bands at 2086, 2073 and 2030 cm−1 corresponding to the vibrations of linearly adsorbed CO on Pt (Pt-CO) atoms which are highly coordinated Pt sites, on terrace and at corner of metallic particles, respectively
[27]
,
[46]
,
[47]
. The Cu/MgAl2O4 and Au/MgAl2O4 counterparts present bands for vibrations of linearly adsorbed CO on Cu (Cu-CO) and Au (Au-CO) at 2100 and 2128 cm−1, respectively. (
Fig. S6
) The Ag/MgAl2O4, however, has no bands in this region. Accordingly, the observed bands at 2110 cm−1, 2059 and 2000 cm−1 for the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 could be assigned to the vibrations of Cu-CO with blueshift and Pt-CO with redshift, respectively. The Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 presents similar bands for Pt-CO at 2059 and 2000 cm−1. The Pt-Au/MgAl2O4 displays blueshift bands for Pt-CO at 2078 and 2035 cm−1 and redshift band for Au-CO at 2119 cm−1. The shifting behaviors of the bands for M-CO and Pt-CO clearly reflect the electron transfers from Cu and Ag to Pt and from Pt to Au in the Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts. Notably, an IR band at 1790 cm−1 which is attributed to bridged CO on Pt metal is distinct over the Pt/MgAl2O4 and shifts to 1800 cm−1 for the Pt-Au/MgAl2O4, while that is absent on the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4. The lack of the bridged CO may imply that metal Pt atoms are surrounded or diluted by metal Cu or Ag atoms,
[48]
in line with the decrease of surface concentrations of Pt over these two samples as disclosed by H2 chemisorption. This suggests that the local geometric structures of surface Pt atoms in Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 would be significantly different from the structures of surface Pt atoms in the Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Au/MgAl2O4 catalysts. The influence of the modulated geometric structure and electronic property on the catalytic performance is discussed below.

3.3.3. Coke analysis
Raman, TG and TPO were used to analyze the type and amount of coke formed on the catalysts after PDH reaction at 580 °C for 24 h. As shown in
Fig. 12
a, all the spent Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts display two Raman bands with same positions at 1323 and 1600 cm−1 which are assigned to be the D and G band of graphite-like carbon, respectively
[49]
,
[50]
. Their intensity ratios are all about 0.80, suggesting that the cokes on the spent catalysts are all graphite-like carbon with similar crystallinity
[10]
,
[50]
,
[51]
. Such similarity in types of cokes is also reflected by the similar temperature ranges for coke combustion in TG and TPO profiles (
Fig. 12
b and c), albeit the TPO peak temperatures (406–445 °C) are slightly influenced due to variations in peak areas. The amounts of weight losses due to coke combustion on the spent Pt/MgAl2O4, Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4, Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Au/MgAl2O4 are 4.7%, 2.2%, 4.2% and 5.9%, respectively. Obviously, coke deposition was suppressed on the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 while was facilitated on the Pt-Au/MgAl2O4.

4. Discussion
In the reaction matrix of propane dehydrogenation, the cleavage of CH bond and rupture of CC bond govern the reaction activity and product selectivities. Polymerization of adsorbed alkenes on catalyst forms coke that gradually blocks the active sites and cause catalyst deactivation. Burning coke with oxygen is an efficient way to expose the active sites and recover the catalytic activity while brings risk of sintering of active metal due to the hotspots caused by coke combustion. As such, an efficient PDH catalyst requires high activity for CH bond cleavage, poor activity for CC bond rupture, weak adsorption of alkenes and high anti-sintering property. The intrinsic activities of the catalysts for CH bond cleavage and CC bond rupture can be reflected by the conversion rate of C3H8 and formation rate of CH4 over the surface Pt atoms. As shown in
Table 1
, the TOF of C3H8 and RateCH4 for the fresh catalysts obtained in kinetic regime are in orders of Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Ag > Pt-Cu ≫ Pt > Pt-Au and Pt/Al2O3 > Pt > Pt-Au > Pt-Ag > Pt-Cu, respectively. The selectivities to C3H6 are above 96% for the Pt-Cu and Pt-Ag catalysts while are only ∼90% for the Pt and Pt-Au catalysts (
Table S4
). The different catalytic performances of surface Pt atoms among the catalysts presumably originate from the modulations of group IB metals to Pt in geometric structure and electronic property (
Fig. 5
,
Fig. 6
,
Fig. 7
,
Fig. 8
,
Fig. 9
,
Fig. 10
,
Fig. 11
). Cu and Ag enhance the activity for CH bond cleavage and suppress the activity for CC bond rupture, possibly because that surface Pt atoms were surrounded or diluted by Cu and Ag and lost the function of neighboring Pt-Pt, as probed by the lack of bridged CO (
Fig. 11
). On the contrary, Au promotes the activity for CC bond rupture due to the greatly improved dispersion of Pt, facilitating the side reactions and coke deposition.
The mechanism of group IB metals influencing the catalytic PDH performance of Pt was further investigated. Since no chemisorbed C3H8 can be detected and the secondary reactions of adsorbed C3H6 govern the selectivity, temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) between adsorbed C3H6 on the catalysts with H2 was conducted and the results are shown in
Fig. 13
a. H2 consumption and C2H4 formation were detected over all the catalysts while CH4 formation was detectable only for the Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Au/MgAl2O4. There were no detectable C3H6, C3H8 and C2H6 for all the catalysts (
Fig. S7
). It is worthy of pointing out that the products are different from those during steady state reaction because the partial pressure of C3H6 is different. For the Pt/MgAl2O4, the peaks of H2 consumption and C2H4 formation associating with propylene hydro-cracking appear at 217 °C and the peak of methane formation presumably via methanation of coke is at 398 °C
[52]
,
[53]
. As for the Pt-Au/MgAl2O4, the former two peaks shift forward to 196 °C while the last peak stays at 398 °C, indicating that Au promotes the hydro-cracking ability of Pt. For the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4, however, the former two peaks shift backward to 323 °C. Notably, the intensities of these two peaks are lower than that for the Pt/MgAl2O4, in line with the smaller dispersion of Pt. CH4 was not detectable presumably due to the less amount of coke. Obviously, the different influence of Cu, Ag and Au to the hydro-cracking ability of Pt is responsible for the selectivity of C3H6. C3H6 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was applied to indicate the polymerization of adsorbed C3H6. As shown in
Figs. 13
b and
S7b
, only H2 and C3H8 were detected in the effluent for all the catalysts, suggesting decomposition of adsorbed C3H6 and hydrogenation of partial adsorbed C3H6. The Pt/MgAl2O4 displays peaks of H2 and C3H8 formation at 420 and 414 °C, respectively. The Pt-Au/MgAl2O4 presents identical profiles of H2 and C3H8 formation to those for the Pt/MgAl2O4. The peaks of H2 formation over the Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 shift backward to 473 and 552 °C, respectively, showing the suppressed dehydrogenation carbonation
[54]
. Formation of C3H8 occurred at 443 °C over the Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 while not happened over the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4, again reflecting the less hydro-cracking ability on these two catalysts. The order of dehydrogenation carbonation is in line with that of the amount of deposited coke on the spent catalysts (
Fig. 12
). Taken together, diluted Pt with enriched electron by adding Cu and Ag suppressed the hydro-cracking and dehydrogenation carbonation of adsorbed propylene, thus improving the propylene selectivity, and vice versa.

The regeneration stability of the catalysts during cyclic reaction-regeneration operations highly depends on the structural stability or recovery ability. Compared with Pt/Al2O3, the enhanced regeneration stability of Pt/MgAl2O4 could be simply attributed to the greatly improved thermal stability of small Pt nanoparticles on the support. For the Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts with similar small sizes of Pt-M bimetallic nanoparticles, the recovery of the surface compositions and even the geometric structures during cyclic reaction-regeneration operations involving reducing-oxidizing cycles would play a key role. As we disclosed above, surface Pt atoms are the major active sites and diluted ones are more selective to producing C3H6. The Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 exhibits stable initial XC3H8 (
Table S3
), benefiting from the little change in the Pt dispersion and the reversible formation of PtCux intermetallic compounds with specific patterns (PtCu3 or PtCu)
[30]
. For the Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4, the decreasing initial XC3H8 is attributed to the decreasing Pt dispersion. Similarly, the Pt-Au/MgAl2O4 exhibits stable initial XC3H8 is due to the high Pt dispersion and the little decrease after cyclic reaction-regeneration operations.
5. Conclusions
In summary, we report that Pt/MgAl2O4 indeed is much stable than conventional Pt/Al2O3 during cyclic dehydrogenation-regeneration operations with little change in dispersion and mean size of Pt. Co-impregnation of group IB metals (M = Cu, Ag and Au) with Pt leads to different modifications on geometric structure and electronic property. Cu and Ag dilute surface Pt atoms and donate electron to Pt while the case for Pt-Au is inverse. As a result, significant enhancement in propylene selectivity and suppression in light hydrocarbon selectivity were obtained on the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 catalyst. The Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 exhibits the highest YC3H6 and the best regeneration stability among the Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts, presumably due to the good initial alloying of Cu with Pt and little phase segregation during cyclic dehydrogenation and regeneration runs. These findings may guide further optimization on the formula of active and stable PDH catalysts.
