Graphical Abstract

Abstract
Recently, dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles with widespread applications have attracted great interest. Despite many publications (>800), the terminology “dendritic” is ambiguous. Understanding what possible “dendritic structures” are, their formation mechanisms and the underlying structure–property relationship is fundamentally important. With the advance of characterization techniques such as electron tomography, two types of tree-branch-like and flower-like structures can be distinguished, both described as “dendritic” in the literature. In this Review, we start with the definition of “dendritic”, then provide critical analysis of reported dendritic silica nanoparticles according to their structural classification. We update the understandings of the formation mechanisms of two types of “dendritic” nanoparticles, highlighting how to control their structural parameters. Applications of dendritic mesoporous nanoparticles are also reviewed with a focus on the biomedical field, providing new insights into the structure–property relationship in this family of nanomaterials.
1 Introduction
The discovery of ordered mesoporous silica materials in the early 1990s by scientists from Japan and the United States extended the size of ordered pores from the micro- (<2 nm) to the meso- (2–50 nm) range; the usage of surfactants as structure-directing agents (so-called templates) launched a new era of mesoporous materials synthesis.1-4 Since then, the synthesis and applications of surfactant-templated mesoporous structures have attracted immense attention. Later in 2003, Lin et al. demonstrated that mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) can be used for controlled drug release5 and intracellular delivery.6 Owing to the ordered mesopores, large specific surface area, rigid as well as biodegradable framework, and easy surface modification, mesoporous nanoparticles have been widely used in drug delivery, biosensors, imaging, catalysis, water treatment, etc.7-10 The synthesis of mesoporous nanoparticles such as MSNs and their applications have been one of the hottest areas in nanotechnology. More than 36 000 and 21 000 records can be found in the ISI Web of Science under the respective topics “mesoporous nanoparticles” and “mesoporous silica nanoparticles” and the number of publications keeps rising.
By utilizing different structure-directing agents such as cationic, anionic, and non-ionic surfactants, mesostructured silica with controllable symmetries and pore parameters can be obtained, with two-dimensional (P6mm, cmm, mesh phase, layered) and three-dimensional order (Fm3m, Im3m, Pm3m, Pm3n, Fd3m, Ia3d, P63/mmc) as well as disordered ones.10 By further adjusting the synthesis conditions such as using additives (e.g. salts, swelling agents, co-solvents and co-surfactants) and hydrothermal treatment, ordered mesostructured MSNs with different mesophases (e.g. MCM-41, MCM-48, SBA-15, SBA-16) and pore sizes have been reported, most having a pore entrance size smaller or equal to the inner pore diameter.11, 12 Besides, the pore sizes of traditional MSNs are relatively small (usually less than 10 nm), limiting their further applications.13 In addition to pore structure and size, the morphology of the particles is usually not highly uniform, mainly reflecting the mesostructure via cooperative assembly in solution.10 For biomedical applications such as delivery of biomacromolecules, the control of pores and pore entrances with relatively large sizes, uniform particle sizes, and morphology is fundamentally important.
Recently, a new type MSNs, so-called “dendritic” mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with central radial pore structures, has been reported and has attracted special interest due to their unconventional open pore structures, comparably large pore sizes, and uniform particle size.7 Unlike the traditional mesostructures, this new type of “dendritic” porous material showed some unique properties. First, the porous nanoparticles show an interesting feature: the pore entrance is larger than the overall pore size. For example, the entrance size of “MSN-CC” (one type of DMSN) can be 60–68 nm while the average pore size calculated by N2 sorption isotherms is 45 nm.14 Second, the pore size distribution can be broad, especially when the sizes are very large (>30 nm), which is in contrast to conventional MSNs usually with a narrow pore size distribution. Third, these particles usually have a uniform size with spherical morphology. Lastly, in addition to the pore structure, the wall structures of these new DMSNs are also different from the well-reported MSNs. Those structure features indicate different formation mechanisms for the “dendritic” MSNs from traditional ones.
Since reported, DMSNs have been utilized as a promising platform for various applications such as therapeutic drug delivery15-17 where large pores and small particle size are advantageous. More than 800 papers have been indexed from the Web of Science under the keywords “dendritic mesoporous silica” or “fibrous mesoporous silica” or “radial mesoporous silica”, indicating the growing attention on this type of MSN in recent years. However, there is an ongoing debate on their structures and formation mechanisms, as reflected by many terminologies used to describe the structures, such as “dendritic”,18-23 “dendrimer-like”,24, 25 “fibrous”,26 “wrinkle”,27 “radial”,7 “fractal”,28 “chrysanthemum-like”,29 “dandelion-type”,30 “stellate”31 and “core-cone shaped”,14, 32 usually accompanying various proposed assembly mechanisms. The main reason for the controversy may come from the limitations of the characterization methods to examine these nanoparticles which have complicated pore structures without ordered mesostructures. “DMSNs” is the most common name used to describe all those types of MSNs,7, 33, 34 even though some of them have clear structure differences.
Currently, there are several review papers7, 35-41 on the synthesis and applications of this new type of MSNs, and all of these particles were classified as “dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs)”. The confusion about their structures and the debate on the formation mechanisms are not clearly addressed. Although in one recent review paper the authors mentioned “there were nanoparticles with easily-confused architectures to that of DMSNs”,36 the structural similarities and differences are not clarified. Despite the similar morphology under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation, the structures and formation process of these DMSNs can be distinctly different, which has been largely overlooked to date.
This Review aims to provide a new perspective into DMSNs with radial pores and their synthesis–structure–property relationships with a focus on biomedical applications. From a different angle compared to published reviews on this topic, we first clarify the definition of dendritic structures and then distinguish two types of DMSNs with radial structures: “flower-like” DMSNs with pores formed with “sheet/lamellar” structures and “tree-branch-like” DMSNs with pores formed by “dendritic/stick” silica subunits. For each category, we identify the structure signatures, placing special emphasis on the underlying mechanisms and how the synthesis conditions affect the pore structure, pore size, particle symmetry, and functionalities. We then discuss the structure–property relationships and mainly the bioapplications of those DMSNs. Finally, our perspectives for future research directions including the challenges and research gaps in this family of MSNs are presented. It is expected that this Review will provide useful guidance for the designed synthesis and applications of this interesting family of nanomaterials.
2 Terminology and Classification: Two Types of Dendritic Structures
Since DMSNs is the most common name for this new family of mesoporous materials, the term “dendritic” has to be understood. “Dendritic” is the adjective form of “dendrite”, which derives from the Greek word “dendron”, meaning “tree”. The term dendritic structure is usually used to describe what is similar to “the branch of a tree” or “having branches like a tree” (Figure 1 a, a photograph showing a branch of a tree). In Leonardo da Vinci's manuscript (Figure 1 b), a dendritic structure is drawn as several branches/offshoots coming from one thicker trunk/stem or bough.42 The branch is referred to as a structure made of a “stick”, which means “a long, thin piece of something”.

The descriptor “dendritic” nanoparticles is mainly based on the characterization of these nanoparticles. Currently, conventional electron microscopy approaches such as TEM and SEM are the main methods. However, TEM provides projected two-dimensional (2D) images of three-dimensional (3D) structures, and the 2D information from TEM hardly represents the genuine 3D configurations due to their intrinsic limitations.43, 44 SEM provides information mainly on surface details, not inner structures. In some cases, the information provided by conventional TEM could even be misleading. For example, DMSNs with rambutan-like (Figure 1 c) and “dahlia or flower-like” (Figure 1 d) structures may both look “dendritic” (Figure 1 e,f) by TEM observation. Recently, advanced characterization methods such as electron tomography (ET) were introduced to reveal the actual structure and provide detailed information including the inner structures.14, 32, 45-47 With the ET technique, we can clearly observe that the rambutan-like DMSNs have a tree-branch-type structure that is composed of “1D branch or stick” silica subunits: the solid part is a baton-like stick, the pores are voids around these solid sticks (Figure 1 g,i). In contrast, the flower-like structure is composed of “2D plane or sheet” like subunits: the solid part is the lamellar or sheet-like silica wall, the pores are voids inside or around these lamellar silica walls (Figure 1 h,j).
In addition to the difference in wall structure, the pore structures are also clearly different. For the “tree-branch-like” structures, the pores are continuous and interpenetrating, as those stick-like walls cannot separate the pores from each other. However, for the “flower-like type”, the pores are presumably isolated and not connected, as they are mainly separated by the sheet-like silica walls. Clearly, the capability to reveal accurate structures is essential for understanding the formation mechanisms of various types of DMSNs as well as their applications. From a comprehensive literature survey, we classify all DMSNs into two types: the “flower-like” type with pores formed from “sheet/lamellar” structures and the “tree-branch-like” (or “rambutan-like)” type with pores formed by “dendritic/stick” silica subunits. Their structures, synthesis conditions, and formation mechanisms will be reviewed separately. Even the term “dendritic” may be more suitable to describe the nanoparticles with a “tree-branch-like type” structure (Figure 1 c); for historic reasons, “flower-like” structures (Figure 1 d) are classified as another type of DMSNs, which will be introduced in the next section.
3 Synthesis, Structures and Formation Mechanisms of DMSNs
Depending on the structure of silica walls with either “sheet-like” or “stick-like” subunits, DMSNs can be divided into two types: flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs. Their structural features, synthesis conditions, and formation mechanisms are reviewed separately in this section.
3.1 Flower-like MSNs and Their Formation Mechanism
Flower-like DMSNs have large pores that are formed typically by sheet-like or lamellar silica walls. For their synthesis, the flower-like DMSNs have been fabricated using soft-templating approaches through a sol–gel process. Quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16H33N(CH3)3-Br, CTAB), cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (C16H33N(CH3)3-Cl, CTAC), and cetylpyridinium bromide (C16H33(C5NH5)-Br, CPB) are predominately used as templates. The addition of oil or specific anions along with the cationic surfactant templates is the key to the formation of the nanoparticles with flower-like morphology. Through the choice of different silica precursors, pure silica or organosilica nanoparticles such as benzene-bridged,49-51 biphenyl-bridged,52 disulfide-bridged,53-55 diselenide-bridged,56 and ethyl-bridged52 organosilica can be fabricated with large pores. In addition, the control of reaction at comparably low pH through the choice of a catalyst such as small organic amines favors the formation of uniform spherical nanoparticles with high dispersity.31 Based on the synthesis conditions, the synthesis approaches are divided into the emulsion synthesis system, biphasic stratification system, and aqueous solution synthesis system.
3.1.1 Emulsion Synthesis System
In the first few reports, flower-like DMSNs with radial pores were all synthesized in a water-oil emulsion system. Early in 2008, Cai and co-workers reported that in a water–ether emulsion system different types of mesostructures can be obtained.57 In their synthesis, CTAB was used as a template, ammonia as the catalyst, and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica precursor. Some spherical particles with radial pores were obtained, together with lamellar structured vesicles and nanotubes, by variation of the ether to water ratio or the ammonia concentration. The authors attributed the formation of a mixture of several structures to fluctuations of the unstable and irregularly shaped biphasic interface. Later in 2009, Okuyama et al. reported a spherical mesoporous silica nanoparticle with open radial outer pores prepared using a water–octane emulsion system together with the additional organic template (polystyrene).58 In their synthesis, TEOS was used as the silica precursor and lysine as a catalyst. Styrene monomer was added into octane/water/CTAB solution as an organic template. Uniform nanoparticles with sizes of 20–80 nm and flower-like pore structures can be obtained. The pore size was tunable from 4 to 15 nm. Subsequently, Zhang59 and Chen60 prepared DMSNs loaded with drugs and quantum dots, respectively, using similar methods. The authors proposed that the nanoparticles were formed inside the CTAB micelles and the pores came from the polymerized polystyrene. However, it is not evident how PS drives the formation of radial large pores. Indeed, subsequent reports18-22, 26, 27 showed that the polystyrene template is not necessary for the formation of these flower-like pores.
In 2010, Polshettiwar and co-authors reported the synthesis of “fibrous” silica nanospheres (KCC-1, Figure 2 a–c) with a size of 250 to 400 nm in a microwave-assisted oil/water (cyclohexane/water) system.26 In their synthesis, CPB, TEOS, and urea (as a base catalyst) were used to assemble in a cyclohexane/water/pentanol mixed solution. From the SEM images (Figure 2 a), the surface of KCC-1 is composed of continuous sheet-like structures. However, according to the authors, KCC-1 is formed “by silica fibres growing uniformly from the centres of the spheres along with the free radial directions” (Figure 2 b,c). It is interesting to note that the diameter of the silica walls shrank from ≈9 to ≈5 nm after calcination, according to high-resolution SEM images of samples without coating (Figure 2 d,e). Although SEM usually does not provide an accurate quantification at this scale (<10 nm), this observation indicates the change from a sandwich-type silica-coated lamella to silica lamella. Nevertheless, the authors proposed that the surfactant molecules self-assemble into radially aligned rod-like reversed micelles (Figure 2 f). In the reversed micelles, the tails of the carbon chains point outward, and the negatively charged silica oligomers deposit on the tails to form the fibrous structure. However, interactions between the hydrophobic tails and the hydrophilic silica oligomers are unlikely to happen, suggesting other possible mechanisms for the self-assembled structures.

Later in 2017, Polshettiwar adapted the “bicontinuous microemulsion droplets” mechanism (Figure 2 g), firstly proposed by Lee,27 to explain the formation of KCC-1.61 According to the authors, the CTAB molecules self-assembled and formed a lamellar structure (step I in Figure 2 g), which was stabilized by the alcohol as a cosurfactant (step II). The lamellar complex formed bicontinuous microemulsion (cyclohexane as the oil) droplets (step III) that eventually agglomerated to minimize the energy of the system (step IV). With the hydrolysis of TEOS, nucleation started on the lamellar structured complex and formed KCC-1. In 2021, time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were used to further study the assembly mechanism in each step of the synthesis.62 Two distinct disordered lamellar phases exist in the emulsions, and the hydrolysis of TEOS inside the reversed lamellar phase (surfactant tail-to-tail) is proposed to be responsible for the formation of the flower-like structure (Figure 2 h). While the formation of a lamellar structure is in accordance with the experimental observations, there is no solid evidence of whether it is a reversed or standard (head-to-head) lamellar structure. Importantly, this mechanism does not explain the radial orientation of large pores, which is an important feature of DMSNs.
In 2010 Du et al.18-22 synthesized dendrimer-like MSNs with radial large pores and small mesopore channels in an ethyl ether/water emulsion system. They proposed a different formation mechanism, i.e., the evaporation of ethyl ether with a low boiling point of 34 °C contributed to the formation of radial pores. During the synthesis, CTAB as a surfactant was added to the ethyl ether/water emulsion system, allowing self-assembly of ethyl ether/CTAB nanodroplets in water. With the hydrolysis of TEOS, the silica oligomers condensed on the surface of surfactant templates and also in the interior of ethyl ether nanodroplets. It is suggested that the continual diffusion of ethyl ether (by gasification) from the interior to the exterior formed the radial structures. In addition, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) was added to this system to obtain amino-functionalized dendrimer-like MSNs in a one-pot synthesis.18 However, this mechanism requires a uniform ethyl ether/water emulsion droplet size distribution in the first place for the subsequent formation of DMSNs with uniform particle size. The gas-diffusion-driven pore formation mechanism is also lacking direct evidence and can hardly be used to explain how the pore sizes can be finely adjusted in a certain range.
Lee et al. systematically investigated the effects of the oil-to-water ratio on the formation of flower-like structures (or “radial wrinkle structures”) in cyclohexane/water systems (Figure 3 a).27 In their synthesis (CATB, urea, and TEOS), DMSNs with uniform particle sizes and dual mesopore sizes (one sharp peak in the 2–4 nm range and another broad peak in the 15–50 nm range) were obtained. The big pores came from silica “wrinkles”, with small mesopores inside the wrinkles. The proposed mechanism is also based on the formation of an oil/water/surfactant bicontinuous microemulsion phase (Figure 3 b). TEOS firstly dissolved in the oil layer and gradually hydrolyzed at the oil–water interface to allow surfactant–silicate assembly in the water phase, leading to the formation of small pores in the silica walls. The oil layers initially surrounded the silica wall; after the removal of oil, the wrinkle structure and large pores are formed. This method was further applied to control the particle sizes and pore sizes of DMSNs.63, 64 A major drawback of this mechanism is that there is no evidence for the existence of small mesopores (2–4 nm) in the silica wall. Moreover, this bicontinuous microemulsion mechanism cannot explain why the silica wall has a uniform thickness in then several nanometer range.

In 2015, Xu et al.14 reported a type of monodispersed MSN with a core-cone structure (MSN-CC, Figure 4 a,b) prepared in a water–chlorobenzene system and explained the formation mechanism via a packing parameter change model.65, 66 The pore size was tunable by changing the stirring speed. MSN-CC can have a pore size as large as 45 nm and a high pore volume of 2.59 cm3 g−1. The large cone-shaped pores were formed by silica lamellae closely packed encircling a spherical core, and the particle morphology was similar to that of the dahlia flower . Under extreme conditions (high amount of oil), even isolated cone-shaped subunits with different opening sizes (Figure 2 c) were observed. With the help of ET, it was revealed that the outer “cone” part is made of sheet-like structures with larger pore sizes, and the inner “core” has smaller pore sizes (Figure 4 d inset). These observations support a supramolecular self-assembly mechanism (Figure 4 d). First, silica-coated micelles self-assemble for form the core particle through homogenous nucleation in the water phase. Oil (chlorobenzene) penetration leads to a structural transformation from spherical micelles to bilayered lamellar structures, which grow on the outer surface of the core particle to form the conic shell with large and open pores. Presumably, the perpendicular growth is because the heterogenous nucleation of lamellar subunits is uniform, and other growth directions are spatially restricted by neighboring subunits.

The above mechanism has been applied in the formation of various DMSNs, including hollow,32, 46 head–tail,47 and multishell54 structures with various applications.67, 68 It is expected that this supramolecular self-assembly mechanism may also be applied to explain the formation of other flower-like MSNs, such as the “fibrous silica nanospheres” 26 and “radial wrinkle structures”.27 Similar to chlorobenzene, the oil used in these syntheses (cyclohexane) can also swell micelles and induce the phase transition to lamellar structures. A detailed comparative study of the impact of different oil molecules on the structure of DMSNs (e.g., characterized by time-dependent TEM and ET studies) could provide further insights.
Later, Meka et al. applied the supra-assembly approach to synthesize functionalized hollow DMSNs (HDMSN-NH2, Figure 5 a–d).32 In the synthesis, an amine silica source (APTES) was introduced into the chlorobenzene–water reaction solution before the addition of TEOS. A vesicle supra-assembly formation mechanism was proposed to explain the unique structure of HDMSN-NH2 (Figure 5 e). When the oil phase containing APTES was added to the water phase containing CTAC, APTES molecules diffused into the water phase due to their relatively hydrophilic nature, especially after hydrolysis. The repulsive force between the cationic CTA+ and protonated amine groups prevents the assembly between CTA+ and aminated silica oligomers. When TEOS was later added, the negatively charged silica oligomers partially neutralized the positively charged silica oligomers from APTES. Both the oil penetration and the reduction in hydrophilic head size favored the formation of self-organized vesicles, and the vesicles gather at the interface of water/oil micro-emulsion droplets to reduce the surface energy. The packing between adjacent vesicles with an open-pore structure formed the final HDMSN morphology (Figure 5 e).

Interestingly, when APTES was added after TEOS, another type of openwork flower-like DMSN was obtained (ODMSN, Figure 5 f–i) through a two-step time-resolved lamellar growth process.69 The core was formed in the first step and then the bowl-like shell in the second step via uniform radial growth; both the core and shell have lamellar building blocks (Figure 5 j,k). The comparison between HDMSN-NH2 and ODMSN indicates that the formation of DMSNs is a dynamic controlled cooperative assembly process, which involves surfactant, co-surfactants (including oil as swelling agent), and silica species. Moreover, the time-resolved observations in Figure 5 f–i provide further evidence of the lamellar growth mechanism.
Haynes et al. fabricated a kind of ultraporous silica nanoparticles in the presence of decane as the oil component (Figure 6 a–c).70 A swelling–aggregation mechanism was proposed (Figure 6 d). Decane swells the CTAB micelles; thus swollen micelles with sizes of 6–12 nm aggregate and form flower-like structures.70 As the authors pointed out, it is not clear whether these ultraporous silica nanoparticles have a hollow structure similar to HDMSN-NH2, or an openwork core similar to ODMSN.69 ET characterization may provide an ultimate answer to this question.

In addition to various surfactant templates, the choice of silica precursor and oil is important in the emulsion synthesis approach to flower-like DMSNs. Instead of the commonly used TEOS, tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) has also been used. Ernawati et al. reported that in an n-octane and water emulsion system, flower-like MSNs with a large pore size of 20 nm and a high specific surface area of 800 m2 g−1 were obtained using CTAB as the surfactant, TMOS as the silica source, and styrene as an additive.71 As oil molecules, cyclohexane,26, 27 octane,58 ethyl ether,18-22 decane,70 and chlorobenzene have been utilized in the preparation of flower-like DMSNs.14, 32, 69 Although accumulating evidence has shown that the use of oil molecules promotes the formation of flower-like DMSNs, they are not essential because similar DMSNs can also be obtained in oil-free synthesis systems (see the section on aqueous solution synthesis below). This similarity between oil and oil-free synthesis systems also suggests a common formation mechanism,14, 32, 62, 69 which will be discussed in the following section.
One advantage of emulsion synthesis is the fabrication of core@shell nanoparticles. When the functional cores are simply added to the above-mentioned different emulsion systems, functional core@flower-like porous silica shell structures can be obtained. For example, the above-mentioned KCC-1 system can be used to grow flower-like porous silica on functional cores, leading to core@shell nanoparticles such as Fe3O4@KCC-1,72, 73 Fe3O4@SiO2@KCC-1,74 SiO2@KCC-1,75 and zeolite@KCC-1.76 The chlorobenzene–water system (MSN-CC) has also been used for the fabrication of core@shell nanoparticles such as Fe2O3@MSN-CC,77 Fe3O4@MSN-CC,78 and SiO2@MSN-CC.79 Kralj et al. prepared iron oxide@flower-like MSNs in an emulsion system with various pore sizes from 5 to 40 nm.80 In their synthesis, various oils including cyclohexane, n-hexane, dibenzyl ether, and toluene were used, showing that the formation of flower-like shells on core@shell nanoparticles is not solvent dependent.
Another advantage of the emulsion synthesis system is the fabrication of asymmetric nanoparticles, which are intriguing objects in diverse fields.81 Some MSNs with asymmetric architectures have been reported recently,82-86 but their pore sizes are relatively small (<10 nm). Assisted by the emulsion synthesis, asymmetric MSNs with flower-like structures and large pores (>10 nm) can be obtained. In 2014, Moon et al. prepared MSNs with a shuttlecock shape in a cyclohexane/water system via a one-pot synthesis (Figure 7 a–d).63 They explained that the flower-like pores were formed via the “bicontinuous emulsion” mechanism. The asymmetric structure was attributed to self-assembled supermicelles (Figure 7 d). A similar head–tail structure (HTMSNs) was also obtained in the chlorobenzene/water system (Figure 7 e–g).87 Preformed “head” particles (e.g., silica) may locate at the chlorobenzene/water interface as an emulsifier to stabilize the emulsion droplet (so-called Pickering emulsion, Figure 7 h). The cooperative self-assembly occurs preferentially in the water phase, leading to the formation of HTMSNs with flower-like tails (Figure 7 i). The Pickering emulsion was evidenced by SEM observations (Figure 7 j). The HTMSNs showed superior hemocompatibility and higher cellular uptake in antigen presenting cells.87 This synthesis strategy can be applied to other head particles that can form Pickering emulsions, such as porous particles, which are more useful for drug delivery applications.87, 88

Besides the asymmetric MSNs, the emulsion synthesis system can also be used for the preparation of asymmetric mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (mPDA) with radial open pores in a 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB)–water system.89 It is noted that hemispherical or hollow morphology can be easily formed. For mPDA, the pores were enlarged via swelling of pluronic block copolymer micelles (around 11 nm).89 In the resulting mPDA, the pores are smaller than those in some asymmetric MSNs whose pore size can be over 30 nm,63, 87 indicative of different formation mechanisms.
3.1.2 Biphase Stratification System
Different from the emulsion-based synthesis system, Zhao's group developed a novel heterogeneous oil–water biphase stratification reaction system and synthesized multilayer DMSNs (Figure 8 a–f) with centre-radial structures in 2014.90 In their design, TEOS was dispersed in the upper oil phase, the surfactants and catalyst (triethanolamine, TEA) were added in the lower water phase. By changing the oil (1-octadecene, decahydronaphthalene, cyclohexane), the pore sizes were varied from 2.8 to 13 nm. An interfacial assembly and growth process was proposed (Figure 8 g). At the oil–water interface, hemi-micelles and silicate oligomers self-assemble into mesostructures. Oil molecules have an impact on the interfacial assembly to adjust the pore size, and this assembly strategy can be repeated. Eventually, 3D-dendritic MSNs with controllable structures are formed.

The biphase stratification method provides an easy way to form core@shell mesoporous silica on other functional nanoparticles such as gold, silver, and magnetic cores.91-94 The biphasic synthesis strategy is also used for the synthesis of large-pore mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles, e.g., benzene-95 or disulfide-bridged53, 54 organosilica.
3.1.3 Aqueous Solution Synthesis
In both the emulsion synthesis and biphase stratification systems, water-immiscible organic solvents are used. Therefore, the stirring speed, which usually plays an important role,14, 90 affects the final structure and is hard to control for large-scale synthesis. Several research groups have developed aqueous solution synthesis approaches for the fabrication of flower-like MSNs. In general, three methods have been developed: 1) the “weak templating method”, 2) the “anion-assisted method”, and 3) the “dual templating method”, as named by the researchers. In aqueous solution synthesis, cationic surfactants (CTA+) and counteranions of different types are needed for the formation of flower-like pores. The synthesis conditions, especially the choice of counteranions, and the resultant particle size and pore sizes of flower-like DMSNs are summarized in Table 1.

In 2013, Zhang et al. developed the “weak templating method” and fabricated monodispersed flower-like DMSNs (called “stellate” MSNs) with tunable central radial pore structures in an oil-free system at kilogram scale (Figure 9 a–d).31 The key is to use cetyltrimethylammonium tosylate (CTA+ Tos−) as a surfactant, and small organic amines such as triethyleneamineor TEA as the catalyst. Two parameters are important in the synthesis (Figure 9 e): the choice of the anion (Tos−) and low pH (≈7, controlled by the concentration of organic amines). The change of Tos− ions to Br− ions led to raspberry-like pores (Figure 9 f), and synthesis at high pH (≈10) resulted in worm-like pores (Figure 9 g), both with small pore sizes. It is proposed that under low pH, the counterions (Tos−) compete with negatively charged silicate oligomers to bind with CTA+ (“weak templating”, Figure 9 h), forming micelles partly “covered” with silicate oligomers and partly with Tos− that further aggregate into the stellate structure. The particle sizes can be adjusted by using ionic liquids as co-surfactants or nonionic surfactants such as pluronic F127.23 This work pioneered the aqueous solution synthesis of DMSNs; however, the partially coated micelle model lacks direct evidence. With the weak templating mechanism it is also hard to explain the comparably uniformed thickness of silica walls observed by SEM.

In 2014, dandelion-type silica spheres with a flower-like porous structure were prepared by adding a pore modifier (benzyl acetate, BENA) to a mixture of TEOS, CTAB, ammonium hydroxide, and acetone (Figure 10).30 The pore sizes can be tuned by changing the amount of BENA (Figure 10 a–d). It is suggested that the BENA molecules may fill the conical space formed by silica cylinders and stabilize the silica spheres. The space occupied by BENA corresponds to the pore size in the final MSNs (Figure 10 e). However, this mechanism requires that 1) silica-coated CTA+ rod micelles can be formed with the length equal to the particle radius; and 2) these rod-like subunits with similar lengths can be packed in a central radial manner with the voids filled by BENA. There is no proof that either requirement is met.

Later in 2016, Yang et al. reported a facile anion-assisted method for the aqueous solution synthesis of MSNs and mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (MONs) with large flower-like pores.46 In their synthesis, salicylate anion (Sal−) and CATB were used as templating agents. The authors suggested that the Sal− anions penetrate into the micelles, possibly with the hydrophobic benzene ring embedded in the long carbon chain region of CTA+ micelles. This leads to an increase in packing parameter (g) and induces the micelles’ structural transition toward vesicular/lamellar structure, eventually resulting in the formation of the flower-like pores. In contrast to emulsion synthesis, the stirring speed had negligible influence on pore structure, suggesting that the penetration of anions into micelles is energetically favored over penetration of oil molecules. In addition to salicylate salts, other anion salts with fluorocarbon anions (trifluoroacetate,68 heptafluorobutyrate,98 perfluorooctanoate68) were also used to form flower-like MSNs. This strategy has been used for the preparation of DMSNs and DMONs for various applications.99-103 Nevertheless, whether the anions are located inside or outside the micelles is the key to differentiating the “weak templating” from the “anion-assisted” mechanism, which remains to be further investigated.
In 2017 Liu et al. reported the synthesis of flower-like MSNs using cationic CTAB and the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as dual templates.96 By tuning the SDS/CTAB/TEOS ratio and adding TMB, the authors fabricated flower-like (Figure 11 a, b), silkworm cocoon-like (Figure 11 c, d), and monolamellar vesicle structured MSNs (Figure 11 e, f). The authors used the “weak templating mechanism” to explain the formation of center-radial structures. Nevertheless, the cation–anion interactions in mixed micelles could be another possibility, which can explain the transition of all structures observed in this study.

In general, the formation of the flower-like DMSNs requires the addition of a hydrophobic oil or anions in the presence of surfactant templates, usually cationic surfactants, which can be carried out in emulsion, biphase stratification or aqueous solution synthesis systems.
3.2 Tree-Branch-like DMSNs and Their Formation Mechanism
In contrast to flower-like DMSNs, tree-branch-like DMSNs are characterized by “dendritic/stick” type silica subunits. The synthesis conditions and formation mechanisms of the two types of DMSNs are also different. This section will focus on tree-branch-like DMSNs. Based on whether surfactants are used or not, their synthesis methods can be divided into surfactant-assisted and surfactant-free approaches.
3.2.1 Surfactant-Assisted Synthesis
In 2017, Zhao et al. reported the synthesis of virus-like MSNs with a spiky tubular rough surface via a single-micelle epitaxial growth approach (Figure 12).104 The synthesis was carried out using CTAB as the template in a cyclohexane–water biphasic system. The obtained virus-like MSNs contain an interior spherical mesoporous core and peripheral silica nanotubes with outside/inside diameters of 10/2.5 nm (Figure 12 a–d). In the synthesis, the mesoporous core formed first (Figure 12 e), followed by the growth of cylindric micelles on the surface (Figure 12 f–h) via an epitaxial growth process (Figure 12 i). The obtained nanoparticles have uniform particle size and excellent monodispersity. The structural parameters of the nanoparticles can be adjusted, with a range of core diameters from ∼60 to 160 nm, tubular lengths from ∼6 to 70 nm, and outer diameters from 6 to 10 nm.

3.2.2 Surfactant-free Synthesis
In 2016 Song et al. reported the synthesis of silica nanopollens with spikes on the surface (Figure 13 a–c).45 An ET image showed a solid and short rod-like subunit structure in the spiky shell (Figure 13 d). The synthesis involves resorcinol (R), formaldehyde (F), and TEOS in a typical Stöber system, without surfactants. The authors proposed that the RF core forms first, then a silica and RF composite shell are deposited on the core. After calcination, silica nanopollens with a hollow cavity and spiky surface were obtained. The co-condensation of RF and silica species is the key to form the surface spikes in this system.

Recently, Fu and co-authors reported the synthesis of MSNs with tree-branch-like morphology: fractal silica nanoparticles with tunable fractal generations and uniform particle sizes (Figure 14 a–f).28 In this synthesis, TEOS, 3-aminophenol (AP)/formaldehyde (F), and ethylenediamine (EDA) were used in the Stöber system. During the reaction, silica primary particles (SPPs) were generated after hydrolysis of TEOS, which condensed for form silica core particles (Figure 14 g, h). The polymerization of APF then began, forming a shell consisting of self-assembled APF and SPPs. The presence of APF in the shell induced the island growth of silica and the formation of fracture structures. Up to three generations of fractal structure can be obtained (Figure 14 h).

The above synthetic strategy can be also used to fabricate Janus heterotrimeric nanoparticles with dendritic morphology (Figure 15 a–f).105 When the amount of EDA was reduced, the APF oligomers nucleated to a comparably larger size and attached to one side of the preformed silica spheres (Figure 15 g). Then SPPs and APF oligomers continuously co-condensed on the other side of silica spheres. Eventually, heterotrimeric nanoparticles with acorn-like Janus morphology were constructed.

In short, tree-branch-like DMSNs can be synthesized either using surfactants via epitaxial growth of rod-like micelles or utilizing a surfactant-free strategy via silica/polymer assembly. The latter approach has control over not only the branch-like silica structure but also the particle asymmetry and fractal generation.
4 Applications of Dendritic Nanoparticles
The distinct structural features of flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs have a significant impact on their biological properties.11-13 A deep insight into structure–property relationships in various functions provides useful guidance in choosing the right type of nanoparticles in target applications. In general, the cone-shaped large pores are more suitable for loading with large molecules due to the large opening pores, while DMSNs with “dendritic/stick type” pores can protect and deliver genes efficiently. The application of both flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs with details of pore structure/size and their performance such as drug loading capacity are summarized in Table 2. The detailed bioapplications of these two types of DMSNs with emphasis on the effects of pore structure towards their function is discussed separately below.

4.1 Bioapplications of Flower-like DMSNs
Flower-like DMSNs have high pore volume, large pore size, and more importantly, large pore openings; thus they are suitable for loading and delivering large molecules. Compared to DMSNs with tree-branch-like structures and a pore volume usually less than 0.5 cm3 g−1, flower-like DMSNs can have a higher volume (as high as 4.5 cm3 g−1).70 This high volume and open pores enable the high loading of large biomolecules. For example, MSN-CC can load proteins with high molecular weight such as IgG (150 kDa) and β-Gal (119 kDa); the loading capacity can reach as high as 566 mg g−1.14 Yang et al. reported dendritic hollow MONs with a high loading capacity of bovine serum albumin, and up to 87 % of the loaded protein can be released.46 MSNs with flower-like pores displayed a very high loading capacity of poorly water-soluble drugs such as telmisartan110 (about 60 % in weight) and paclitaxel106 (about 82 % in weight). Yue et al. fabricated large-pore dahlia-like DMSNs that displayed high loading capacity of DOX and RNase A (258 and 386 μg mg−1, respectively).107
Benefitting from their high drug loading capacity, flower-like MSNs can deliver functional biomolecules efficiently. Li et al. delivered a functional/therapeutic protein (hyaluronan synthase type 2, HAS2) using MSN-CC for osteoarthritis management. The enzyme was delivered into synoviocytes from the temporomandibular joint, generating endogenous HA with high molecular weights. In a rat osteoarthritis inflammation model, this strategy also promoted endogenous HA production and inhibited the synovial inflammation of OA for more than three weeks with one-shot administration (Figure 16 a–c).111 Shao et al. prepared diselenide-bridged organosilica with flower-like pores and encapsulated a high amount of cytotoxic RNase A into the pores.56 The RNase A can be released in an oxidative and redox dual-responsive manner. Enhanced anticancer efficacy was observed in both in vitro and in vivo tests. DMSNs with flower-like pores were also used for CRISPR complex delivery, including the delivery of Cas9 protein (≈160 kDa), short gRNA, and Cas9 plasmid.108 A better in vivo gene editing efficacy was achieved in the liver compared to the current liposome (Lipofectamine 3000) based delivery system (54 % vs. 33 %).

In addition to drug delivery, flower-like DMSNs can be further functionalized for catalysis, phototherapy, and other applications. DMSNs have been incorporated with gold,103, 112, 113 silver,114 iron oxide,103, 115, 116 quantum dots,117, 118 upconversion NPs,119 tantalum,120 palladium,121 ruthenium,122-124 nickel, cobalt and zinc oxides,125 vanadium,126 and calcium127 as well as multiple nanoparticles/elements.117 For example, Gao et al. reported the construction of Au and Fe3O4 NPs coloaded DMSNs with the flower-like structure for tumor microenvironment responsive tumor therapy (Figure 16 d, e). DMSNs were loaded with high amounts of Au and Fe3O4 NPs, which catalyzed the conversion of D-glucose into toxic hydroxyl radicals for inducing tumor-cell death (Figure 16 f). Extensive in vitro and in vivo evaluations have demonstrated excellent efficacy in tumor suppression (Figure 16 g).103
4.2 Bioapplication of Tree-Branch-like DMSNs
For tree-branch-type DMSNs, Song et al. firstly reported that the spiky surface nanotopography possessed enhanced loading capacity, protection against degradation from enzymes, and transfection efficiency of the rope-like loop structured DNA molecules (plasmids, Figure 17 a) compared to flower-like DMSNs or nanoparticles with hemisphere-like rough surface topographies (Figure 17 b, c).48, 109 The spiky nanotopography provides a continuous open space for gene molecules and may shelter genes against enzymatic attack (Figure 17 d). Chen et al. fabricated tree-branch-type DMSNs encapsulating gold nanorods (yolk–shell structure) and co-delivered hydrophobic drug and antioncogene p53 in a near-infrared (NIR) responsive manner. Taking advantage of surface roughness (tree-branch-type MSNs) and photothermal effects of the gold nanorods, synergistic effects towards cancer therapy were achieved both in vitro and in vivo.128 Tree-branch-type MSNs also demonstrated superior transfection of DNA vaccine in vivo compared to commercial transfection agents recently.129

In addition to the contribution on its interaction with biomolecules, the spiky topography is also demonstrated to enhance interactions with cells. Zhao et al. revealed that the spiky morphology mimicking the spikes of virus exhibited enhanced cellular uptake properties via invading cells within 5 min and prolonged blood circulation time compared to conventional silica nanoparticles (t1/2: 2.16 h vs. 0.45 h).104 Moreover, the spiky silica nanoparticles also acted as an adjuvant by enhanced antigen-presenting cell maturation, which collectively boosted the immune responses.129 In addition to mammalian cells, Song et al. showed that the tree-branch structure promoted the adhesion towards bacterial membrane and enhanced the antimicrobial performance of a natural enzyme, lysozyme.45
In short, compared to traditional MSNs with ordered pore structure and relatively small pore entrance size, flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs have shown some advantages due to their unique structures. Flower-like DMSNs have demonstrated higher loading capacity towards various molecules including small-molecule drugs, proteins, and even genes. This advantage is mainly attributed to their large, center-radial, and open pores with high accessibility. For example, flower-like DMSNs (KCC-1) absorbed double the amount of large biomolecules compared to traditional MCM-41.130 For tree-branch-like DMSNs, this nanotopography enhanced their loading capacity and binding ability towards rope-like biomolecules such as plasmids compared to traditional MSNs with a comparably smooth surface. In addition, the tree-branch-like morphology increased the cellular uptake efficacy.104 Both types of DMSNs usually have a very uniform size with spherical morphology, which provide additional benefits in biomedical applications such as drug delivery. It should also be noted that DMSNs may have potentially unfavorable features for specific applications. For example, in contrast to traditional MSNs with uniform pore sizes, DMSNs usually have a broad pore size distribution, making the drug loading and releasing profile sometimes difficult to predict. In addition, the silica walls of DMSNs are usually thin, which may not be suitable for applications that require high stability.
5 Future Perspectives
Despite significant advances in the synthesis and applications of various types of DMSNs, several challenges remain that need future exploration.
5.1 Advanced Techniques to Characterize DMSNs
The intricate geometric features of flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs characterized by traditional TEM may cause confusion. It is recommended that both TEM and SEM should be used to provide genuine nanostructural information. SEM is especially useful to differentiate the tree-branch-like DMSNs with sharp tips on the external surface of nanoparticles. ET is a suitable technique to reveal delicate features44 and is suggested as a standard characterization tool for DMSNs.
The pores of most flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs show unconventional and unsymmetrical geometries. Suitable methods are urgently needed to precisely characterize their pore sizes. Currently, gas sorption analysis (e.g., nitrogen) is widely used to determine the pore size distribution of traditional MSNs. However, current methods to calculate the pore size rely on given pore geometry such as cylinders, slits, or spheres. For example, the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model is based on a model of cylindrical pores,131 which is not suitable when applied to DMSNs. This is also evidenced by the fact that the pore sizes of DMSNs calculated using the BJH method usually do not match the values measured by TEM or SEM. It is necessary to develop new models for the flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs.
5.2 Understanding the Formation Mechanisms
For the controllable, on-demand synthesis of DMSNs, it is essential to understand the underlying assembly pathways. While different formation mechanisms have been proposed for DMSNs, there are a number of unanswered questions. For the flower-like DMSNs, their various formation mechanisms should be reviewed with solid evidence. For example, for anion-assisted formation of DMSNs, the exact location of anions (e.g., inside the cationic surfactant micelles or outside) is important, but not very clear to date. Both experimental and computational approaches may be helpful to answer this question. Even for the lamellae-formation mechanism with direct observations,62 details about the lamellar structure are unclear, e.g., whether it is a silica oligomer/surfactant bilayer/silica oligomer structure or another structure. More importantly, it is not clear whether it is a head-to-head or tail-to-tail lamellar structure (as suggested in some reports).
5.3 Precise Control over the Structures and Pores
Compared to MSNs/DMSNs with a simple structure, multileveled, hierarchical and multifunctional mesoporous nanoparticles are of great interest and offer additional advantages. Currently, asymmetry/Janus-like, core@shell, yolk@shell flower-like DMSNs have been obtained in the emulsion synthesis system and biphase stratification system.63, 80, 87 There are not many reports for the fabrication of multileveled tree-branch-like DMSNs. Indeed, the assembly of tree-branch-type DMSNs has just emerged, with much to understand. How to control their structural parameters, either in a simple or composite structure, remains to be investigated to broaden their applications. For example, for silica/polymer assembly via the surfactant-free, it is still challenging to preciously control the thickness, length, shape and density of these tree-branch-like subunits.
In addition, currently reported flower-like DMSNs have thin walls (in the range of several nanometres). It would be interesting to explore the possibility to synthesize DMSNs with increased wall thickness, which is important for understanding the formation mechanism and increases their stability in selected applications.
5.4 Development of Functionalized DMSNs
To extend the applications of functional DMSNs, it is highly desired to add more functionalities into their framework, either through in situ synthesis or post-modification. To date, various DMONs with organic functional groups in the silica frameworks have been reported in bioapplications such as drug/gene delivery.132 However, precise control over the composition distribution, pore size and particle size of DMONs is usually more difficult than DMSNs. Moreover, the synthesis of tree-branch-like DMSNs with organosilica composition is rarely reported. Controlling the composition and distribution of functional organic moieties in DMSNs will provide new opportunities for their development.
6 Conclusion
In conclusion, we have provided a comprehensive review of the history and development of DMSNs. Based on their structural features, DMSNs can be divided into two types: flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs. The flower-like DMSNs with center-radial large pores and high pore volumes can be synthesized in an emulsion synthesis system, biphasic stratification system, or aqueous solution synthesis system. The tree-branch-like MSNs with dendritic silica subunits can be synthesized by surfactant-assisted or surfactant-free approaches. Due to their structure difference, flower-like DMSNs have advantages for loading and delivering large biomacromolecules such as proteins, while tree-branch-like DMSNs are more suitable for DNA/RNA delivery. We have also provided critical analysis of the formation mechanisms of two types of DMSNs, especially the flower-like DMSNs, aiming to provide an updated understanding of how such structures are assembled. With more research questions to be answered in the near future (only some mentioned in this Review), it is expected that DMSNs will attract more attention in various applications.

Citing Literature
1 Introduction
The discovery of ordered mesoporous silica materials in the early 1990s by scientists from Japan and the United States extended the size of ordered pores from the micro- (<2 nm) to the meso- (2–50 nm) range; the usage of surfactants as structure-directing agents (so-called templates) launched a new era of mesoporous materials synthesis.1-4 Since then, the synthesis and applications of surfactant-templated mesoporous structures have attracted immense attention. Later in 2003, Lin et al. demonstrated that mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) can be used for controlled drug release5 and intracellular delivery.6 Owing to the ordered mesopores, large specific surface area, rigid as well as biodegradable framework, and easy surface modification, mesoporous nanoparticles have been widely used in drug delivery, biosensors, imaging, catalysis, water treatment, etc.7-10 The synthesis of mesoporous nanoparticles such as MSNs and their applications have been one of the hottest areas in nanotechnology. More than 36 000 and 21 000 records can be found in the ISI Web of Science under the respective topics “mesoporous nanoparticles” and “mesoporous silica nanoparticles” and the number of publications keeps rising.
By utilizing different structure-directing agents such as cationic, anionic, and non-ionic surfactants, mesostructured silica with controllable symmetries and pore parameters can be obtained, with two-dimensional (P6mm, cmm, mesh phase, layered) and three-dimensional order (Fm3m, Im3m, Pm3m, Pm3n, Fd3m, Ia3d, P63/mmc) as well as disordered ones.10 By further adjusting the synthesis conditions such as using additives (e.g. salts, swelling agents, co-solvents and co-surfactants) and hydrothermal treatment, ordered mesostructured MSNs with different mesophases (e.g. MCM-41, MCM-48, SBA-15, SBA-16) and pore sizes have been reported, most having a pore entrance size smaller or equal to the inner pore diameter.11, 12 Besides, the pore sizes of traditional MSNs are relatively small (usually less than 10 nm), limiting their further applications.13 In addition to pore structure and size, the morphology of the particles is usually not highly uniform, mainly reflecting the mesostructure via cooperative assembly in solution.10 For biomedical applications such as delivery of biomacromolecules, the control of pores and pore entrances with relatively large sizes, uniform particle sizes, and morphology is fundamentally important.
Recently, a new type MSNs, so-called “dendritic” mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with central radial pore structures, has been reported and has attracted special interest due to their unconventional open pore structures, comparably large pore sizes, and uniform particle size.7 Unlike the traditional mesostructures, this new type of “dendritic” porous material showed some unique properties. First, the porous nanoparticles show an interesting feature: the pore entrance is larger than the overall pore size. For example, the entrance size of “MSN-CC” (one type of DMSN) can be 60–68 nm while the average pore size calculated by N2 sorption isotherms is 45 nm.14 Second, the pore size distribution can be broad, especially when the sizes are very large (>30 nm), which is in contrast to conventional MSNs usually with a narrow pore size distribution. Third, these particles usually have a uniform size with spherical morphology. Lastly, in addition to the pore structure, the wall structures of these new DMSNs are also different from the well-reported MSNs. Those structure features indicate different formation mechanisms for the “dendritic” MSNs from traditional ones.
Since reported, DMSNs have been utilized as a promising platform for various applications such as therapeutic drug delivery15-17 where large pores and small particle size are advantageous. More than 800 papers have been indexed from the Web of Science under the keywords “dendritic mesoporous silica” or “fibrous mesoporous silica” or “radial mesoporous silica”, indicating the growing attention on this type of MSN in recent years. However, there is an ongoing debate on their structures and formation mechanisms, as reflected by many terminologies used to describe the structures, such as “dendritic”,18-23 “dendrimer-like”,24, 25 “fibrous”,26 “wrinkle”,27 “radial”,7 “fractal”,28 “chrysanthemum-like”,29 “dandelion-type”,30 “stellate”31 and “core-cone shaped”,14, 32 usually accompanying various proposed assembly mechanisms. The main reason for the controversy may come from the limitations of the characterization methods to examine these nanoparticles which have complicated pore structures without ordered mesostructures. “DMSNs” is the most common name used to describe all those types of MSNs,7, 33, 34 even though some of them have clear structure differences.
Currently, there are several review papers7, 35-41 on the synthesis and applications of this new type of MSNs, and all of these particles were classified as “dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs)”. The confusion about their structures and the debate on the formation mechanisms are not clearly addressed. Although in one recent review paper the authors mentioned “there were nanoparticles with easily-confused architectures to that of DMSNs”,36 the structural similarities and differences are not clarified. Despite the similar morphology under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation, the structures and formation process of these DMSNs can be distinctly different, which has been largely overlooked to date.
This Review aims to provide a new perspective into DMSNs with radial pores and their synthesis–structure–property relationships with a focus on biomedical applications. From a different angle compared to published reviews on this topic, we first clarify the definition of dendritic structures and then distinguish two types of DMSNs with radial structures: “flower-like” DMSNs with pores formed with “sheet/lamellar” structures and “tree-branch-like” DMSNs with pores formed by “dendritic/stick” silica subunits. For each category, we identify the structure signatures, placing special emphasis on the underlying mechanisms and how the synthesis conditions affect the pore structure, pore size, particle symmetry, and functionalities. We then discuss the structure–property relationships and mainly the bioapplications of those DMSNs. Finally, our perspectives for future research directions including the challenges and research gaps in this family of MSNs are presented. It is expected that this Review will provide useful guidance for the designed synthesis and applications of this interesting family of nanomaterials.
2 Terminology and Classification: Two Types of Dendritic Structures
Since DMSNs is the most common name for this new family of mesoporous materials, the term “dendritic” has to be understood. “Dendritic” is the adjective form of “dendrite”, which derives from the Greek word “dendron”, meaning “tree”. The term dendritic structure is usually used to describe what is similar to “the branch of a tree” or “having branches like a tree” (Figure 1 a, a photograph showing a branch of a tree). In Leonardo da Vinci's manuscript (Figure 1 b), a dendritic structure is drawn as several branches/offshoots coming from one thicker trunk/stem or bough.42 The branch is referred to as a structure made of a “stick”, which means “a long, thin piece of something”.

Reproduced from ref. 48 with permission from the American Chemical Society.
The descriptor “dendritic” nanoparticles is mainly based on the characterization of these nanoparticles. Currently, conventional electron microscopy approaches such as TEM and SEM are the main methods. However, TEM provides projected two-dimensional (2D) images of three-dimensional (3D) structures, and the 2D information from TEM hardly represents the genuine 3D configurations due to their intrinsic limitations.43, 44 SEM provides information mainly on surface details, not inner structures. In some cases, the information provided by conventional TEM could even be misleading. For example, DMSNs with rambutan-like (Figure 1 c) and “dahlia or flower-like” (Figure 1 d) structures may both look “dendritic” (Figure 1 e,f) by TEM observation. Recently, advanced characterization methods such as electron tomography (ET) were introduced to reveal the actual structure and provide detailed information including the inner structures.14, 32, 45-47 With the ET technique, we can clearly observe that the rambutan-like DMSNs have a tree-branch-type structure that is composed of “1D branch or stick” silica subunits: the solid part is a baton-like stick, the pores are voids around these solid sticks (Figure 1 g,i). In contrast, the flower-like structure is composed of “2D plane or sheet” like subunits: the solid part is the lamellar or sheet-like silica wall, the pores are voids inside or around these lamellar silica walls (Figure 1 h,j).
In addition to the difference in wall structure, the pore structures are also clearly different. For the “tree-branch-like” structures, the pores are continuous and interpenetrating, as those stick-like walls cannot separate the pores from each other. However, for the “flower-like type”, the pores are presumably isolated and not connected, as they are mainly separated by the sheet-like silica walls. Clearly, the capability to reveal accurate structures is essential for understanding the formation mechanisms of various types of DMSNs as well as their applications. From a comprehensive literature survey, we classify all DMSNs into two types: the “flower-like” type with pores formed from “sheet/lamellar” structures and the “tree-branch-like” (or “rambutan-like)” type with pores formed by “dendritic/stick” silica subunits. Their structures, synthesis conditions, and formation mechanisms will be reviewed separately. Even the term “dendritic” may be more suitable to describe the nanoparticles with a “tree-branch-like type” structure (Figure 1 c); for historic reasons, “flower-like” structures (Figure 1 d) are classified as another type of DMSNs, which will be introduced in the next section.
3 Synthesis, Structures and Formation Mechanisms of DMSNs
Depending on the structure of silica walls with either “sheet-like” or “stick-like” subunits, DMSNs can be divided into two types: flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs. Their structural features, synthesis conditions, and formation mechanisms are reviewed separately in this section.
3.1 Flower-like MSNs and Their Formation Mechanism
Flower-like DMSNs have large pores that are formed typically by sheet-like or lamellar silica walls. For their synthesis, the flower-like DMSNs have been fabricated using soft-templating approaches through a sol–gel process. Quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16H33N(CH3)3-Br, CTAB), cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (C16H33N(CH3)3-Cl, CTAC), and cetylpyridinium bromide (C16H33(C5NH5)-Br, CPB) are predominately used as templates. The addition of oil or specific anions along with the cationic surfactant templates is the key to the formation of the nanoparticles with flower-like morphology. Through the choice of different silica precursors, pure silica or organosilica nanoparticles such as benzene-bridged,49-51 biphenyl-bridged,52 disulfide-bridged,53-55 diselenide-bridged,56 and ethyl-bridged52 organosilica can be fabricated with large pores. In addition, the control of reaction at comparably low pH through the choice of a catalyst such as small organic amines favors the formation of uniform spherical nanoparticles with high dispersity.31 Based on the synthesis conditions, the synthesis approaches are divided into the emulsion synthesis system, biphasic stratification system, and aqueous solution synthesis system.
3.1.1 Emulsion Synthesis System
In the first few reports, flower-like DMSNs with radial pores were all synthesized in a water-oil emulsion system. Early in 2008, Cai and co-workers reported that in a water–ether emulsion system different types of mesostructures can be obtained.57 In their synthesis, CTAB was used as a template, ammonia as the catalyst, and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica precursor. Some spherical particles with radial pores were obtained, together with lamellar structured vesicles and nanotubes, by variation of the ether to water ratio or the ammonia concentration. The authors attributed the formation of a mixture of several structures to fluctuations of the unstable and irregularly shaped biphasic interface. Later in 2009, Okuyama et al. reported a spherical mesoporous silica nanoparticle with open radial outer pores prepared using a water–octane emulsion system together with the additional organic template (polystyrene).58 In their synthesis, TEOS was used as the silica precursor and lysine as a catalyst. Styrene monomer was added into octane/water/CTAB solution as an organic template. Uniform nanoparticles with sizes of 20–80 nm and flower-like pore structures can be obtained. The pore size was tunable from 4 to 15 nm. Subsequently, Zhang59 and Chen60 prepared DMSNs loaded with drugs and quantum dots, respectively, using similar methods. The authors proposed that the nanoparticles were formed inside the CTAB micelles and the pores came from the polymerized polystyrene. However, it is not evident how PS drives the formation of radial large pores. Indeed, subsequent reports18-22, 26, 27 showed that the polystyrene template is not necessary for the formation of these flower-like pores.
In 2010, Polshettiwar and co-authors reported the synthesis of “fibrous” silica nanospheres (KCC-1, Figure 2 a–c) with a size of 250 to 400 nm in a microwave-assisted oil/water (cyclohexane/water) system.26 In their synthesis, CPB, TEOS, and urea (as a base catalyst) were used to assemble in a cyclohexane/water/pentanol mixed solution. From the SEM images (Figure 2 a), the surface of KCC-1 is composed of continuous sheet-like structures. However, according to the authors, KCC-1 is formed “by silica fibres growing uniformly from the centres of the spheres along with the free radial directions” (Figure 2 b,c). It is interesting to note that the diameter of the silica walls shrank from ≈9 to ≈5 nm after calcination, according to high-resolution SEM images of samples without coating (Figure 2 d,e). Although SEM usually does not provide an accurate quantification at this scale (<10 nm), this observation indicates the change from a sandwich-type silica-coated lamella to silica lamella. Nevertheless, the authors proposed that the surfactant molecules self-assemble into radially aligned rod-like reversed micelles (Figure 2 f). In the reversed micelles, the tails of the carbon chains point outward, and the negatively charged silica oligomers deposit on the tails to form the fibrous structure. However, interactions between the hydrophobic tails and the hydrophilic silica oligomers are unlikely to happen, suggesting other possible mechanisms for the self-assembled structures.

Later in 2017, Polshettiwar adapted the “bicontinuous microemulsion droplets” mechanism (Figure 2 g), firstly proposed by Lee,27 to explain the formation of KCC-1.61 According to the authors, the CTAB molecules self-assembled and formed a lamellar structure (step I in Figure 2 g), which was stabilized by the alcohol as a cosurfactant (step II). The lamellar complex formed bicontinuous microemulsion (cyclohexane as the oil) droplets (step III) that eventually agglomerated to minimize the energy of the system (step IV). With the hydrolysis of TEOS, nucleation started on the lamellar structured complex and formed KCC-1. In 2021, time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were used to further study the assembly mechanism in each step of the synthesis.62 Two distinct disordered lamellar phases exist in the emulsions, and the hydrolysis of TEOS inside the reversed lamellar phase (surfactant tail-to-tail) is proposed to be responsible for the formation of the flower-like structure (Figure 2 h). While the formation of a lamellar structure is in accordance with the experimental observations, there is no solid evidence of whether it is a reversed or standard (head-to-head) lamellar structure. Importantly, this mechanism does not explain the radial orientation of large pores, which is an important feature of DMSNs.
In 2010 Du et al.18-22 synthesized dendrimer-like MSNs with radial large pores and small mesopore channels in an ethyl ether/water emulsion system. They proposed a different formation mechanism, i.e., the evaporation of ethyl ether with a low boiling point of 34 °C contributed to the formation of radial pores. During the synthesis, CTAB as a surfactant was added to the ethyl ether/water emulsion system, allowing self-assembly of ethyl ether/CTAB nanodroplets in water. With the hydrolysis of TEOS, the silica oligomers condensed on the surface of surfactant templates and also in the interior of ethyl ether nanodroplets. It is suggested that the continual diffusion of ethyl ether (by gasification) from the interior to the exterior formed the radial structures. In addition, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) was added to this system to obtain amino-functionalized dendrimer-like MSNs in a one-pot synthesis.18 However, this mechanism requires a uniform ethyl ether/water emulsion droplet size distribution in the first place for the subsequent formation of DMSNs with uniform particle size. The gas-diffusion-driven pore formation mechanism is also lacking direct evidence and can hardly be used to explain how the pore sizes can be finely adjusted in a certain range.
Lee et al. systematically investigated the effects of the oil-to-water ratio on the formation of flower-like structures (or “radial wrinkle structures”) in cyclohexane/water systems (Figure 3 a).27 In their synthesis (CATB, urea, and TEOS), DMSNs with uniform particle sizes and dual mesopore sizes (one sharp peak in the 2–4 nm range and another broad peak in the 15–50 nm range) were obtained. The big pores came from silica “wrinkles”, with small mesopores inside the wrinkles. The proposed mechanism is also based on the formation of an oil/water/surfactant bicontinuous microemulsion phase (Figure 3 b). TEOS firstly dissolved in the oil layer and gradually hydrolyzed at the oil–water interface to allow surfactant–silicate assembly in the water phase, leading to the formation of small pores in the silica walls. The oil layers initially surrounded the silica wall; after the removal of oil, the wrinkle structure and large pores are formed. This method was further applied to control the particle sizes and pore sizes of DMSNs.63, 64 A major drawback of this mechanism is that there is no evidence for the existence of small mesopores (2–4 nm) in the silica wall. Moreover, this bicontinuous microemulsion mechanism cannot explain why the silica wall has a uniform thickness in then several nanometer range.

In 2015, Xu et al.14 reported a type of monodispersed MSN with a core-cone structure (MSN-CC, Figure 4 a,b) prepared in a water–chlorobenzene system and explained the formation mechanism via a packing parameter change model.65, 66 The pore size was tunable by changing the stirring speed. MSN-CC can have a pore size as large as 45 nm and a high pore volume of 2.59 cm3 g−1. The large cone-shaped pores were formed by silica lamellae closely packed encircling a spherical core, and the particle morphology was similar to that of the dahlia flower . Under extreme conditions (high amount of oil), even isolated cone-shaped subunits with different opening sizes (Figure 2 c) were observed. With the help of ET, it was revealed that the outer “cone” part is made of sheet-like structures with larger pore sizes, and the inner “core” has smaller pore sizes (Figure 4 d inset). These observations support a supramolecular self-assembly mechanism (Figure 4 d). First, silica-coated micelles self-assemble for form the core particle through homogenous nucleation in the water phase. Oil (chlorobenzene) penetration leads to a structural transformation from spherical micelles to bilayered lamellar structures, which grow on the outer surface of the core particle to form the conic shell with large and open pores. Presumably, the perpendicular growth is because the heterogenous nucleation of lamellar subunits is uniform, and other growth directions are spatially restricted by neighboring subunits.

The above mechanism has been applied in the formation of various DMSNs, including hollow,32, 46 head–tail,47 and multishell54 structures with various applications.67, 68 It is expected that this supramolecular self-assembly mechanism may also be applied to explain the formation of other flower-like MSNs, such as the “fibrous silica nanospheres” 26 and “radial wrinkle structures”.27 Similar to chlorobenzene, the oil used in these syntheses (cyclohexane) can also swell micelles and induce the phase transition to lamellar structures. A detailed comparative study of the impact of different oil molecules on the structure of DMSNs (e.g., characterized by time-dependent TEM and ET studies) could provide further insights.
Later, Meka et al. applied the supra-assembly approach to synthesize functionalized hollow DMSNs (HDMSN-NH2, Figure 5 a–d).32 In the synthesis, an amine silica source (APTES) was introduced into the chlorobenzene–water reaction solution before the addition of TEOS. A vesicle supra-assembly formation mechanism was proposed to explain the unique structure of HDMSN-NH2 (Figure 5 e). When the oil phase containing APTES was added to the water phase containing CTAC, APTES molecules diffused into the water phase due to their relatively hydrophilic nature, especially after hydrolysis. The repulsive force between the cationic CTA+ and protonated amine groups prevents the assembly between CTA+ and aminated silica oligomers. When TEOS was later added, the negatively charged silica oligomers partially neutralized the positively charged silica oligomers from APTES. Both the oil penetration and the reduction in hydrophilic head size favored the formation of self-organized vesicles, and the vesicles gather at the interface of water/oil micro-emulsion droplets to reduce the surface energy. The packing between adjacent vesicles with an open-pore structure formed the final HDMSN morphology (Figure 5 e).

Interestingly, when APTES was added after TEOS, another type of openwork flower-like DMSN was obtained (ODMSN, Figure 5 f–i) through a two-step time-resolved lamellar growth process.69 The core was formed in the first step and then the bowl-like shell in the second step via uniform radial growth; both the core and shell have lamellar building blocks (Figure 5 j,k). The comparison between HDMSN-NH2 and ODMSN indicates that the formation of DMSNs is a dynamic controlled cooperative assembly process, which involves surfactant, co-surfactants (including oil as swelling agent), and silica species. Moreover, the time-resolved observations in Figure 5 f–i provide further evidence of the lamellar growth mechanism.
Haynes et al. fabricated a kind of ultraporous silica nanoparticles in the presence of decane as the oil component (Figure 6 a–c).70 A swelling–aggregation mechanism was proposed (Figure 6 d). Decane swells the CTAB micelles; thus swollen micelles with sizes of 6–12 nm aggregate and form flower-like structures.70 As the authors pointed out, it is not clear whether these ultraporous silica nanoparticles have a hollow structure similar to HDMSN-NH2, or an openwork core similar to ODMSN.69 ET characterization may provide an ultimate answer to this question.

In addition to various surfactant templates, the choice of silica precursor and oil is important in the emulsion synthesis approach to flower-like DMSNs. Instead of the commonly used TEOS, tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) has also been used. Ernawati et al. reported that in an n-octane and water emulsion system, flower-like MSNs with a large pore size of 20 nm and a high specific surface area of 800 m2 g−1 were obtained using CTAB as the surfactant, TMOS as the silica source, and styrene as an additive.71 As oil molecules, cyclohexane,26, 27 octane,58 ethyl ether,18-22 decane,70 and chlorobenzene have been utilized in the preparation of flower-like DMSNs.14, 32, 69 Although accumulating evidence has shown that the use of oil molecules promotes the formation of flower-like DMSNs, they are not essential because similar DMSNs can also be obtained in oil-free synthesis systems (see the section on aqueous solution synthesis below). This similarity between oil and oil-free synthesis systems also suggests a common formation mechanism,14, 32, 62, 69 which will be discussed in the following section.
One advantage of emulsion synthesis is the fabrication of core@shell nanoparticles. When the functional cores are simply added to the above-mentioned different emulsion systems, functional core@flower-like porous silica shell structures can be obtained. For example, the above-mentioned KCC-1 system can be used to grow flower-like porous silica on functional cores, leading to core@shell nanoparticles such as Fe3O4@KCC-1,72, 73 Fe3O4@SiO2@KCC-1,74 SiO2@KCC-1,75 and zeolite@KCC-1.76 The chlorobenzene–water system (MSN-CC) has also been used for the fabrication of core@shell nanoparticles such as Fe2O3@MSN-CC,77 Fe3O4@MSN-CC,78 and SiO2@MSN-CC.79 Kralj et al. prepared iron oxide@flower-like MSNs in an emulsion system with various pore sizes from 5 to 40 nm.80 In their synthesis, various oils including cyclohexane, n-hexane, dibenzyl ether, and toluene were used, showing that the formation of flower-like shells on core@shell nanoparticles is not solvent dependent.
Another advantage of the emulsion synthesis system is the fabrication of asymmetric nanoparticles, which are intriguing objects in diverse fields.81 Some MSNs with asymmetric architectures have been reported recently,82-86 but their pore sizes are relatively small (<10 nm). Assisted by the emulsion synthesis, asymmetric MSNs with flower-like structures and large pores (>10 nm) can be obtained. In 2014, Moon et al. prepared MSNs with a shuttlecock shape in a cyclohexane/water system via a one-pot synthesis (Figure 7 a–d).63 They explained that the flower-like pores were formed via the “bicontinuous emulsion” mechanism. The asymmetric structure was attributed to self-assembled supermicelles (Figure 7 d). A similar head–tail structure (HTMSNs) was also obtained in the chlorobenzene/water system (Figure 7 e–g).87 Preformed “head” particles (e.g., silica) may locate at the chlorobenzene/water interface as an emulsifier to stabilize the emulsion droplet (so-called Pickering emulsion, Figure 7 h). The cooperative self-assembly occurs preferentially in the water phase, leading to the formation of HTMSNs with flower-like tails (Figure 7 i). The Pickering emulsion was evidenced by SEM observations (Figure 7 j). The HTMSNs showed superior hemocompatibility and higher cellular uptake in antigen presenting cells.87 This synthesis strategy can be applied to other head particles that can form Pickering emulsions, such as porous particles, which are more useful for drug delivery applications.87, 88

Besides the asymmetric MSNs, the emulsion synthesis system can also be used for the preparation of asymmetric mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (mPDA) with radial open pores in a 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB)–water system.89 It is noted that hemispherical or hollow morphology can be easily formed. For mPDA, the pores were enlarged via swelling of pluronic block copolymer micelles (around 11 nm).89 In the resulting mPDA, the pores are smaller than those in some asymmetric MSNs whose pore size can be over 30 nm,63, 87 indicative of different formation mechanisms.
3.1.2 Biphase Stratification System
Different from the emulsion-based synthesis system, Zhao's group developed a novel heterogeneous oil–water biphase stratification reaction system and synthesized multilayer DMSNs (Figure 8 a–f) with centre-radial structures in 2014.90 In their design, TEOS was dispersed in the upper oil phase, the surfactants and catalyst (triethanolamine, TEA) were added in the lower water phase. By changing the oil (1-octadecene, decahydronaphthalene, cyclohexane), the pore sizes were varied from 2.8 to 13 nm. An interfacial assembly and growth process was proposed (Figure 8 g). At the oil–water interface, hemi-micelles and silicate oligomers self-assemble into mesostructures. Oil molecules have an impact on the interfacial assembly to adjust the pore size, and this assembly strategy can be repeated. Eventually, 3D-dendritic MSNs with controllable structures are formed.

The biphase stratification method provides an easy way to form core@shell mesoporous silica on other functional nanoparticles such as gold, silver, and magnetic cores.91-94 The biphasic synthesis strategy is also used for the synthesis of large-pore mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles, e.g., benzene-95 or disulfide-bridged53, 54 organosilica.
3.1.3 Aqueous Solution Synthesis
In both the emulsion synthesis and biphase stratification systems, water-immiscible organic solvents are used. Therefore, the stirring speed, which usually plays an important role,14, 90 affects the final structure and is hard to control for large-scale synthesis. Several research groups have developed aqueous solution synthesis approaches for the fabrication of flower-like MSNs. In general, three methods have been developed: 1) the “weak templating method”, 2) the “anion-assisted method”, and 3) the “dual templating method”, as named by the researchers. In aqueous solution synthesis, cationic surfactants (CTA+) and counteranions of different types are needed for the formation of flower-like pores. The synthesis conditions, especially the choice of counteranions, and the resultant particle size and pore sizes of flower-like DMSNs are summarized in Table 1.

In 2013, Zhang et al. developed the “weak templating method” and fabricated monodispersed flower-like DMSNs (called “stellate” MSNs) with tunable central radial pore structures in an oil-free system at kilogram scale (Figure 9 a–d).31 The key is to use cetyltrimethylammonium tosylate (CTA+ Tos−) as a surfactant, and small organic amines such as triethyleneamineor TEA as the catalyst. Two parameters are important in the synthesis (Figure 9 e): the choice of the anion (Tos−) and low pH (≈7, controlled by the concentration of organic amines). The change of Tos− ions to Br− ions led to raspberry-like pores (Figure 9 f), and synthesis at high pH (≈10) resulted in worm-like pores (Figure 9 g), both with small pore sizes. It is proposed that under low pH, the counterions (Tos−) compete with negatively charged silicate oligomers to bind with CTA+ (“weak templating”, Figure 9 h), forming micelles partly “covered” with silicate oligomers and partly with Tos− that further aggregate into the stellate structure. The particle sizes can be adjusted by using ionic liquids as co-surfactants or nonionic surfactants such as pluronic F127.23 This work pioneered the aqueous solution synthesis of DMSNs; however, the partially coated micelle model lacks direct evidence. With the weak templating mechanism it is also hard to explain the comparably uniformed thickness of silica walls observed by SEM.

In 2014, dandelion-type silica spheres with a flower-like porous structure were prepared by adding a pore modifier (benzyl acetate, BENA) to a mixture of TEOS, CTAB, ammonium hydroxide, and acetone (Figure 10).30 The pore sizes can be tuned by changing the amount of BENA (Figure 10 a–d). It is suggested that the BENA molecules may fill the conical space formed by silica cylinders and stabilize the silica spheres. The space occupied by BENA corresponds to the pore size in the final MSNs (Figure 10 e). However, this mechanism requires that 1) silica-coated CTA+ rod micelles can be formed with the length equal to the particle radius; and 2) these rod-like subunits with similar lengths can be packed in a central radial manner with the voids filled by BENA. There is no proof that either requirement is met.

Later in 2016, Yang et al. reported a facile anion-assisted method for the aqueous solution synthesis of MSNs and mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (MONs) with large flower-like pores.46 In their synthesis, salicylate anion (Sal−) and CATB were used as templating agents. The authors suggested that the Sal− anions penetrate into the micelles, possibly with the hydrophobic benzene ring embedded in the long carbon chain region of CTA+ micelles. This leads to an increase in packing parameter (g) and induces the micelles’ structural transition toward vesicular/lamellar structure, eventually resulting in the formation of the flower-like pores. In contrast to emulsion synthesis, the stirring speed had negligible influence on pore structure, suggesting that the penetration of anions into micelles is energetically favored over penetration of oil molecules. In addition to salicylate salts, other anion salts with fluorocarbon anions (trifluoroacetate,68 heptafluorobutyrate,98 perfluorooctanoate68) were also used to form flower-like MSNs. This strategy has been used for the preparation of DMSNs and DMONs for various applications.99-103 Nevertheless, whether the anions are located inside or outside the micelles is the key to differentiating the “weak templating” from the “anion-assisted” mechanism, which remains to be further investigated.
In 2017 Liu et al. reported the synthesis of flower-like MSNs using cationic CTAB and the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as dual templates.96 By tuning the SDS/CTAB/TEOS ratio and adding TMB, the authors fabricated flower-like (Figure 11 a, b), silkworm cocoon-like (Figure 11 c, d), and monolamellar vesicle structured MSNs (Figure 11 e, f). The authors used the “weak templating mechanism” to explain the formation of center-radial structures. Nevertheless, the cation–anion interactions in mixed micelles could be another possibility, which can explain the transition of all structures observed in this study.

In general, the formation of the flower-like DMSNs requires the addition of a hydrophobic oil or anions in the presence of surfactant templates, usually cationic surfactants, which can be carried out in emulsion, biphase stratification or aqueous solution synthesis systems.
3.2 Tree-Branch-like DMSNs and Their Formation Mechanism
In contrast to flower-like DMSNs, tree-branch-like DMSNs are characterized by “dendritic/stick” type silica subunits. The synthesis conditions and formation mechanisms of the two types of DMSNs are also different. This section will focus on tree-branch-like DMSNs. Based on whether surfactants are used or not, their synthesis methods can be divided into surfactant-assisted and surfactant-free approaches.
3.2.1 Surfactant-Assisted Synthesis
In 2017, Zhao et al. reported the synthesis of virus-like MSNs with a spiky tubular rough surface via a single-micelle epitaxial growth approach (Figure 12).104 The synthesis was carried out using CTAB as the template in a cyclohexane–water biphasic system. The obtained virus-like MSNs contain an interior spherical mesoporous core and peripheral silica nanotubes with outside/inside diameters of 10/2.5 nm (Figure 12 a–d). In the synthesis, the mesoporous core formed first (Figure 12 e), followed by the growth of cylindric micelles on the surface (Figure 12 f–h) via an epitaxial growth process (Figure 12 i). The obtained nanoparticles have uniform particle size and excellent monodispersity. The structural parameters of the nanoparticles can be adjusted, with a range of core diameters from ∼60 to 160 nm, tubular lengths from ∼6 to 70 nm, and outer diameters from 6 to 10 nm.

3.2.2 Surfactant-free Synthesis
In 2016 Song et al. reported the synthesis of silica nanopollens with spikes on the surface (Figure 13 a–c).45 An ET image showed a solid and short rod-like subunit structure in the spiky shell (Figure 13 d). The synthesis involves resorcinol (R), formaldehyde (F), and TEOS in a typical Stöber system, without surfactants. The authors proposed that the RF core forms first, then a silica and RF composite shell are deposited on the core. After calcination, silica nanopollens with a hollow cavity and spiky surface were obtained. The co-condensation of RF and silica species is the key to form the surface spikes in this system.

Recently, Fu and co-authors reported the synthesis of MSNs with tree-branch-like morphology: fractal silica nanoparticles with tunable fractal generations and uniform particle sizes (Figure 14 a–f).28 In this synthesis, TEOS, 3-aminophenol (AP)/formaldehyde (F), and ethylenediamine (EDA) were used in the Stöber system. During the reaction, silica primary particles (SPPs) were generated after hydrolysis of TEOS, which condensed for form silica core particles (Figure 14 g, h). The polymerization of APF then began, forming a shell consisting of self-assembled APF and SPPs. The presence of APF in the shell induced the island growth of silica and the formation of fracture structures. Up to three generations of fractal structure can be obtained (Figure 14 h).

The above synthetic strategy can be also used to fabricate Janus heterotrimeric nanoparticles with dendritic morphology (Figure 15 a–f).105 When the amount of EDA was reduced, the APF oligomers nucleated to a comparably larger size and attached to one side of the preformed silica spheres (Figure 15 g). Then SPPs and APF oligomers continuously co-condensed on the other side of silica spheres. Eventually, heterotrimeric nanoparticles with acorn-like Janus morphology were constructed.

In short, tree-branch-like DMSNs can be synthesized either using surfactants via epitaxial growth of rod-like micelles or utilizing a surfactant-free strategy via silica/polymer assembly. The latter approach has control over not only the branch-like silica structure but also the particle asymmetry and fractal generation.
4 Applications of Dendritic Nanoparticles
The distinct structural features of flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs have a significant impact on their biological properties.11-13 A deep insight into structure–property relationships in various functions provides useful guidance in choosing the right type of nanoparticles in target applications. In general, the cone-shaped large pores are more suitable for loading with large molecules due to the large opening pores, while DMSNs with “dendritic/stick type” pores can protect and deliver genes efficiently. The application of both flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs with details of pore structure/size and their performance such as drug loading capacity are summarized in Table 2. The detailed bioapplications of these two types of DMSNs with emphasis on the effects of pore structure towards their function is discussed separately below.

4.1 Bioapplications of Flower-like DMSNs
Flower-like DMSNs have high pore volume, large pore size, and more importantly, large pore openings; thus they are suitable for loading and delivering large molecules. Compared to DMSNs with tree-branch-like structures and a pore volume usually less than 0.5 cm3 g−1, flower-like DMSNs can have a higher volume (as high as 4.5 cm3 g−1).70 This high volume and open pores enable the high loading of large biomolecules. For example, MSN-CC can load proteins with high molecular weight such as IgG (150 kDa) and β-Gal (119 kDa); the loading capacity can reach as high as 566 mg g−1.14 Yang et al. reported dendritic hollow MONs with a high loading capacity of bovine serum albumin, and up to 87 % of the loaded protein can be released.46 MSNs with flower-like pores displayed a very high loading capacity of poorly water-soluble drugs such as telmisartan110 (about 60 % in weight) and paclitaxel106 (about 82 % in weight). Yue et al. fabricated large-pore dahlia-like DMSNs that displayed high loading capacity of DOX and RNase A (258 and 386 μg mg−1, respectively).107
Benefitting from their high drug loading capacity, flower-like MSNs can deliver functional biomolecules efficiently. Li et al. delivered a functional/therapeutic protein (hyaluronan synthase type 2, HAS2) using MSN-CC for osteoarthritis management. The enzyme was delivered into synoviocytes from the temporomandibular joint, generating endogenous HA with high molecular weights. In a rat osteoarthritis inflammation model, this strategy also promoted endogenous HA production and inhibited the synovial inflammation of OA for more than three weeks with one-shot administration (Figure 16 a–c).111 Shao et al. prepared diselenide-bridged organosilica with flower-like pores and encapsulated a high amount of cytotoxic RNase A into the pores.56 The RNase A can be released in an oxidative and redox dual-responsive manner. Enhanced anticancer efficacy was observed in both in vitro and in vivo tests. DMSNs with flower-like pores were also used for CRISPR complex delivery, including the delivery of Cas9 protein (≈160 kDa), short gRNA, and Cas9 plasmid.108 A better in vivo gene editing efficacy was achieved in the liver compared to the current liposome (Lipofectamine 3000) based delivery system (54 % vs. 33 %).

In addition to drug delivery, flower-like DMSNs can be further functionalized for catalysis, phototherapy, and other applications. DMSNs have been incorporated with gold,103, 112, 113 silver,114 iron oxide,103, 115, 116 quantum dots,117, 118 upconversion NPs,119 tantalum,120 palladium,121 ruthenium,122-124 nickel, cobalt and zinc oxides,125 vanadium,126 and calcium127 as well as multiple nanoparticles/elements.117 For example, Gao et al. reported the construction of Au and Fe3O4 NPs coloaded DMSNs with the flower-like structure for tumor microenvironment responsive tumor therapy (Figure 16 d, e). DMSNs were loaded with high amounts of Au and Fe3O4 NPs, which catalyzed the conversion of D-glucose into toxic hydroxyl radicals for inducing tumor-cell death (Figure 16 f). Extensive in vitro and in vivo evaluations have demonstrated excellent efficacy in tumor suppression (Figure 16 g).103
4.2 Bioapplication of Tree-Branch-like DMSNs
For tree-branch-type DMSNs, Song et al. firstly reported that the spiky surface nanotopography possessed enhanced loading capacity, protection against degradation from enzymes, and transfection efficiency of the rope-like loop structured DNA molecules (plasmids, Figure 17 a) compared to flower-like DMSNs or nanoparticles with hemisphere-like rough surface topographies (Figure 17 b, c).48, 109 The spiky nanotopography provides a continuous open space for gene molecules and may shelter genes against enzymatic attack (Figure 17 d). Chen et al. fabricated tree-branch-type DMSNs encapsulating gold nanorods (yolk–shell structure) and co-delivered hydrophobic drug and antioncogene p53 in a near-infrared (NIR) responsive manner. Taking advantage of surface roughness (tree-branch-type MSNs) and photothermal effects of the gold nanorods, synergistic effects towards cancer therapy were achieved both in vitro and in vivo.128 Tree-branch-type MSNs also demonstrated superior transfection of DNA vaccine in vivo compared to commercial transfection agents recently.129

In addition to the contribution on its interaction with biomolecules, the spiky topography is also demonstrated to enhance interactions with cells. Zhao et al. revealed that the spiky morphology mimicking the spikes of virus exhibited enhanced cellular uptake properties via invading cells within 5 min and prolonged blood circulation time compared to conventional silica nanoparticles (t1/2: 2.16 h vs. 0.45 h).104 Moreover, the spiky silica nanoparticles also acted as an adjuvant by enhanced antigen-presenting cell maturation, which collectively boosted the immune responses.129 In addition to mammalian cells, Song et al. showed that the tree-branch structure promoted the adhesion towards bacterial membrane and enhanced the antimicrobial performance of a natural enzyme, lysozyme.45
In short, compared to traditional MSNs with ordered pore structure and relatively small pore entrance size, flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs have shown some advantages due to their unique structures. Flower-like DMSNs have demonstrated higher loading capacity towards various molecules including small-molecule drugs, proteins, and even genes. This advantage is mainly attributed to their large, center-radial, and open pores with high accessibility. For example, flower-like DMSNs (KCC-1) absorbed double the amount of large biomolecules compared to traditional MCM-41.130 For tree-branch-like DMSNs, this nanotopography enhanced their loading capacity and binding ability towards rope-like biomolecules such as plasmids compared to traditional MSNs with a comparably smooth surface. In addition, the tree-branch-like morphology increased the cellular uptake efficacy.104 Both types of DMSNs usually have a very uniform size with spherical morphology, which provide additional benefits in biomedical applications such as drug delivery. It should also be noted that DMSNs may have potentially unfavorable features for specific applications. For example, in contrast to traditional MSNs with uniform pore sizes, DMSNs usually have a broad pore size distribution, making the drug loading and releasing profile sometimes difficult to predict. In addition, the silica walls of DMSNs are usually thin, which may not be suitable for applications that require high stability.
5 Future Perspectives
Despite significant advances in the synthesis and applications of various types of DMSNs, several challenges remain that need future exploration.
5.1 Advanced Techniques to Characterize DMSNs
The intricate geometric features of flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs characterized by traditional TEM may cause confusion. It is recommended that both TEM and SEM should be used to provide genuine nanostructural information. SEM is especially useful to differentiate the tree-branch-like DMSNs with sharp tips on the external surface of nanoparticles. ET is a suitable technique to reveal delicate features44 and is suggested as a standard characterization tool for DMSNs.
The pores of most flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs show unconventional and unsymmetrical geometries. Suitable methods are urgently needed to precisely characterize their pore sizes. Currently, gas sorption analysis (e.g., nitrogen) is widely used to determine the pore size distribution of traditional MSNs. However, current methods to calculate the pore size rely on given pore geometry such as cylinders, slits, or spheres. For example, the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model is based on a model of cylindrical pores,131 which is not suitable when applied to DMSNs. This is also evidenced by the fact that the pore sizes of DMSNs calculated using the BJH method usually do not match the values measured by TEM or SEM. It is necessary to develop new models for the flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs.
5.2 Understanding the Formation Mechanisms
For the controllable, on-demand synthesis of DMSNs, it is essential to understand the underlying assembly pathways. While different formation mechanisms have been proposed for DMSNs, there are a number of unanswered questions. For the flower-like DMSNs, their various formation mechanisms should be reviewed with solid evidence. For example, for anion-assisted formation of DMSNs, the exact location of anions (e.g., inside the cationic surfactant micelles or outside) is important, but not very clear to date. Both experimental and computational approaches may be helpful to answer this question. Even for the lamellae-formation mechanism with direct observations,62 details about the lamellar structure are unclear, e.g., whether it is a silica oligomer/surfactant bilayer/silica oligomer structure or another structure. More importantly, it is not clear whether it is a head-to-head or tail-to-tail lamellar structure (as suggested in some reports).
5.3 Precise Control over the Structures and Pores
Compared to MSNs/DMSNs with a simple structure, multileveled, hierarchical and multifunctional mesoporous nanoparticles are of great interest and offer additional advantages. Currently, asymmetry/Janus-like, core@shell, yolk@shell flower-like DMSNs have been obtained in the emulsion synthesis system and biphase stratification system.63, 80, 87 There are not many reports for the fabrication of multileveled tree-branch-like DMSNs. Indeed, the assembly of tree-branch-type DMSNs has just emerged, with much to understand. How to control their structural parameters, either in a simple or composite structure, remains to be investigated to broaden their applications. For example, for silica/polymer assembly via the surfactant-free, it is still challenging to preciously control the thickness, length, shape and density of these tree-branch-like subunits.
In addition, currently reported flower-like DMSNs have thin walls (in the range of several nanometres). It would be interesting to explore the possibility to synthesize DMSNs with increased wall thickness, which is important for understanding the formation mechanism and increases their stability in selected applications.
5.4 Development of Functionalized DMSNs
To extend the applications of functional DMSNs, it is highly desired to add more functionalities into their framework, either through in situ synthesis or post-modification. To date, various DMONs with organic functional groups in the silica frameworks have been reported in bioapplications such as drug/gene delivery.132 However, precise control over the composition distribution, pore size and particle size of DMONs is usually more difficult than DMSNs. Moreover, the synthesis of tree-branch-like DMSNs with organosilica composition is rarely reported. Controlling the composition and distribution of functional organic moieties in DMSNs will provide new opportunities for their development.
6 Conclusion
In conclusion, we have provided a comprehensive review of the history and development of DMSNs. Based on their structural features, DMSNs can be divided into two types: flower-like and tree-branch-like DMSNs. The flower-like DMSNs with center-radial large pores and high pore volumes can be synthesized in an emulsion synthesis system, biphasic stratification system, or aqueous solution synthesis system. The tree-branch-like MSNs with dendritic silica subunits can be synthesized by surfactant-assisted or surfactant-free approaches. Due to their structure difference, flower-like DMSNs have advantages for loading and delivering large biomacromolecules such as proteins, while tree-branch-like DMSNs are more suitable for DNA/RNA delivery. We have also provided critical analysis of the formation mechanisms of two types of DMSNs, especially the flower-like DMSNs, aiming to provide an updated understanding of how such structures are assembled. With more research questions to be answered in the near future (only some mentioned in this Review), it is expected that DMSNs will attract more attention in various applications.
