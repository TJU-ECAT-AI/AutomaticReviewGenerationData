Abstract
Metal-loaded zeolitic membranes are promising candidates as catalytic membrane reactors. We report a one-step synthesis method to synthesize zeolite membranes containing metal nanoclusters, that has advantages in comparison to multistep methods such as impregnation and ion exchange. Pure-silica MFI zeolite-Pt hybrid membranes were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis with addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) and a platinum precursor. Composition analysis and mapping by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) reveal that Pt ions/clusters are uniformly distributed along the membrane cross-section. High-magnification scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis shows that Pt metal clusters in the hybrid zeolite membrane have a diameter distribution in the range of 0.5–2.0 nm. In contrast, a pure-silica MFI membrane synthesized from an MPS-free solution shows negligible incorporation of Pt metal clusters. To characterize the properties of the hybrid (zeolite/metal) membrane, it was used as a catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) for high-temperature propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 600 °C and 1 atm. The results indicate that Pt metal clusters formed within the MFI zeolite membrane can serve as effective catalysts for high-temperature PDH reaction along with H2 removal via membrane permeation, thereby increasing both conversion and selectivity in relation to a conventional membrane reactor containing an equivalent amount of packed Pt catalyst in contact with an MFI membrane. The hybrid zeolite-Pt CMR also showed stable conversion and selectivity upon extended high-temperature operation (12 h), indicating that encapsulation in the zeolite allowed thermal stabilization of the Pt nanoclusters and reduced catalyst deactivation.

Introduction
Zeolite membranes have generated interest for more than two decades because of their well-defined micropore structure, hydrothermal stability, resistance to extreme chemical environments, and their excellent performance in applications such as molecular separation and process intensification using membrane reactors (MRs). There have been a number of reports on the inclusion of metal particles in nanoporous materials such as zeolites to obtain new catalytic or separation properties. (1-24) Two main routes taken for this purpose are (1) impregnation of metal salts in the zeolite pores and subsequent calcination or (2) ion-exchange of metal ions into the zeolite followed by reduction to form metal particles within the zeolite structure. Several studies have also appeared on the application of these techniques to prepare metal-loaded zeolite membranes. For example, Lindmark et al. (23) impregnated MFI membranes with a solution of Ca(NO3)2 in methanol by spin-coating and calcination at 600 °C to thermally decompose the nitrate salts. The CO2/H2 separation factor for the calcium-impregnated membranes at 25 °C was 3.4, about 5 times higher than the separation factor of an MFI membrane without impregnation. It was suggested that the impregnated calcium compounds introduced new adsorption sites and thereby enhanced the transport of CO2. Hasegawa et al. (22) synthesized a defect-free Y-type zeolite membrane on the inner surface of a porous α-alumina tube by a hydrothermal process. The membrane was then ion-exchanged with an aqueous solution of [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 to give a Pt-loaded Y-type zeolite membrane, which was calcined in air and then reduced in a flow of H2. Bernardo et al. (21) prepared Pt-loaded FAU catalytic membranes by ion-exchange. The membranes were used for the purification of H2-rich streams by means of CO selective oxidation. A CO conversion of 98% and a selectivity of 62% were measured feeding a H2-rich mixture containing 10% CO at 200 °C.
Although postsynthesis treatment methods have been successful in introducing a limited amount of metallic content into zeolite membranes, these methods need at least two or three steps in addition to the membrane synthesis itself. Recent work has reported a one-step synthesis method to encapsulate metal nanoparticles in zeolite crystals. For example, Choi et al. (25) reported a synthetic strategy to encapsulate metal clusters within zeolites and mesoporous silicas during their formation. The use of a mercaptosilane ligand facilitated the selective and quantitative encapsulation of metals of catalytic interest within NaA, a zeolite with pore windows that are too small for postsynthesis encapsulation of noble metal precursors. These materials exhibited high catalytic shape selectivities in hydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions as well as resistance against sulfur poisoning and thermal sintering as a consequence of metal encapsulation in the zeolitic micropores. Chen et al. (26) have applied a similar methodology to develop a one-pot coassembly method for direct introduction of highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles into the mesochannels of SBA-15. Compared with conventional supported Pt–SiO2 catalysts, the Pt nanoparticles confined in ordered SBA-15 showed higher stability in methylcylohexane dehydrogenation reactions. Wong et al. (27) demonstrated the one-step colloidal synthesis of subnanometer CdS clusters in hydrophobic MFI-type zeolite crystals in the presence of 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS). During the synthesis, the three methoxysilane groups of MPS underwent hydrolysis and allowed incorporation of the Si atom into the zeolite framework, while the 3-mercaptopropyl group remains connected to the Si atom and allows capture of metal species in the pores. The MFI crystal pores thus functioned as nanochambers for the condensation of CdS clusters and also prevented their further agglomeration.
In this work, we extend the above methodology to zeolite membranes, and describe a one-step in situ synthesis of zeolite membranes incorporating metal nanoclusters. Metal-loaded zeolitic membranes could be promising candidates as catalytic membranes that function simultaneously as reactors and separation devices. Specifically, we demonstrate the formation of a hybrid pure-silica MFI/Pt nanocluster membrane, which is achieved by one-step hydrothermal synthesis with addition of MPS and a Pt precursor to the synthesis solution. The membrane composition and morphology are studied in detail with high-resolution imaging and compositional mapping techniques. Furthermore, we characterize the catalytic properties of the zeolite membrane via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at an elevated temperature of 600 °C.
Experimental Methods
Hybrid MFI-Pt Powder Synthesis
Hybrid zeolite MFI/Pt powders were prepared from MPS-containing synthesis solution without MFI seeds (HZ) or with MFI seeds (HZ-S). Pure-silica MFI zeolite powders from an MPS-free synthesis solution (HZ-N) were also prepared. The hybrid zeolite synthesis solutions without MFI seeds (HZ and HZ-N) was prepared as follows: TPAOH (1M, Sigma-Aldrich) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%, Acros) was mixed in deionized water. After 30 min of stirring, 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane, (MPS, 95%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added and then tetraammine platinum(II) chloride (Pt(NH3)4Cl2·H2O, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the solution under constant stirring. The molar composition of the gel was TEOS: 0.114 TPAOH: 37.20 H2O: X MPS: Y Pt. X was 0 for HZ-N, and was varied from 0.010 to 0.040 for HZ, corresponding to a range of Si/Pt ratios from 25 to 100. Y was varied from 0 to 0.040, corresponding to a range of Si/Pt ratios from ∞ to 25. After the precursor was stirred for 3 h, it was transferred into the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (Parr). The synthesis experiments were performed at 150 °C for 17–96 h. After the hydrothermal reaction, the hybrid zeolite powders were washed thoroughly with deionized water, dried, and calcined in air at 550 °C for 6 h to remove the structure-directing agent (SDA). The powders were dried at 60 °C in an oven overnight before use. The hybrid zeolite synthesis solution with MFI seeds (HZ-S) was the same as that used for HZ and HZ-N, except that 10 drops of 40 wt %. MFI seeds suspension (∼100 nm) were added to the synthesis solution just after Pt(NH3)4Cl2·H2O was added. To prepare a pure-silica MFI seed suspension, the synthesis solution was prepared, aged, and hydrothermally treated in exactly the same manner as reported previously. (24, 28) Recovery by washing and centrifugation was carried out as described previously. (24) Then the MFI nanoparticles were dried at 60 °C for 24 h in an oven, and calcined in air at 550 °C for 6 h to remove the SDA from the seed crystals.
Hybrid MFI-Pt Membrane Synthesis by Seeded Growth
Hybrid zeolite MFI/Pt membranes were synthesized on porous α-alumina disks by seeded growth. Details of the macroporous α-alumina disks (Coorstek) and their polishing prior to membrane growth are identical to those described previously. (24) The precursor solution for a pure-silica MFI seed suspension and the membrane synthesis solution were the same as those used for hybrid MFI zeolite powders. To prepare a seeded α-alumina disk, the MFI seeds were dip-coated on the α-alumina supports, dried, and calcined using the same procedures described elsewhere. (24, 29) To prepare a MFI/Pt hybrid membrane, the seeded disk was placed vertically at the bottom of the vessel and completely immersed in the synthesis solution. Hydrothermal synthesis was carried out at 150 °C for 17–96 h. The membrane was then washed thoroughly with deionized water, dried, calcined in air at 550 °C for 6 h, and dried at 60 °C in an oven overnight.
Structural Characterization
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) were performed on a JEOL LEO-1530 at 15 kV using the “InLens” mode detector. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained from a PANalytical X’pert diffractometer using a CuKα source, diffracted beam collimator, and a proportional detector. Elemental analysis by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) was performed by Columbia Analytics (Tucson, AZ). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out using Thermo K-Alpha spectrometer employing a monochromatic Al kα X-ray source. A pressure of about 5 × 10–8 Torr was maintained in the analytical chamber during surface analysis. The binding energies (BE) of all elements were referenced to the C 1s peak of contaminant carbon at 284.8 eV with an uncertainty of ±0.2 eV. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) including the near-edge and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (XANES and EXAFS) was performed at beamline X-18B of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory. The XAS data for the Pt LIII edge were obtained in transmission mode. The spectra were measured at room temperature in air with Pt foil as an energy reference. The samples were ground and dispersed onto a poly(imide)-based Kapton tape. A different number of loaded Kapton layers were used to obtain an attenuation length of approximately one. Three scans from 11360 to 12800 eV were collected for each sample. The XAS data were then processed with the Athena program for background removal, edge-step normalization, and Fourier transform. XANES data was used to analyze electronic state, while EXAFS data were used to assess cluster size.
The morphology and high-resolution images of hybrid MFI zeolite powders and membranes were characterized using a Hitachi HF-3300 TEM-STEM at 300 kV in TEM mode at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). For the Pt particle size distribution of hybrid powders and membranes, high angle annular dark-field scanning electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were taken with JEOL 2100FS STEM at ORNL. Particle size distributions were determined by counting at least 200 crystallites. Before imaging, the hybrid zeolite powders were prepared by dispersing the particles in methanol, sonicating the dispersion, and dropping on a lacey carbon film/Cu grid. The powder samples were carbon coated to prevent charging. On the other hand, the hybrid zeolite membranes were embedded into an adhesive polymer, and subsequently sectioned by diamond-knife ultramicrotomy. The samples were mechanically thinned and dimpled, and further thinned by low angle ion milling and polishing (Fischione Ion Milling System). Cross-sectional membrane samples with a nominal thickness of ∼50 nm were mounted on carbon grids for observation. Particle size distributions were determined by counting at least 100 crystals by using Gatan Digital Micrograph.
Permeation Measurements
Before calcination, the integrity of the zeolite membrane was checked via He permeation measurements, for which a transient permeation setup with upstream pressure of 25–30 psi at room temperature was employed. The membranes had very low He permeances (less than 1.0 × 10–10 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1). After calcination, H2/C3H8 binary gas permeation was measured at 25–650 °C. The membrane permeance for component i is defined as

where Qi (mol) is the amount of gas permeated over a time period t (s), Am = 2.38 cm2 is the active membrane area, and ΔPi (Pa) is the transmembrane pressure. The H2/C3H8 ideal permselectivity (αH2/C3H8°) is defined as the ratio of their pure gas permeances:

The H2/C3H8 separation factor (aH2/C3H8) for the binary mixture is given by

where yH2 and yC3H8 are mole fractions of H2 and C3H8, respectively.
PDH Reaction
The membrane reactor setup is schematically shown in Figure 1. The disk membrane was mounted in a stainless steel cell sealed by soft graphite gaskets (Mercer Gasket & Shim). A quartz wool pad was placed over the MFI zeolite membrane and a quartz rod was placed on top of the pad. The pad served as a gas diffusion layer for the feed stream. The hybrid MFI-Pt catalytic membrane is here referred to as the ‘catalytic membrane reactor’ (CMR), whereas the conventional membrane reactor comprising a catalyst bed in contact with a membrane is referred to as the ‘packed bed membrane reactor’ (PBMR). A reactor containing only a catalyst bed with no membrane is referred to as the “packed bed reactor” (PBR). The external gas tightness of the membrane cell and tubing connections was verified by soap bubble tests. The MR was installed in a temperature programmable furnace. The internal membrane sealing quality was verified by measuring the H2/C3H8 separation performance at 25–600 °C.
Figure 1
Figure 1. Schematic of the membrane reactor system.
Before the PDH reaction, the CMR, PBMR, or PBR reactor was exposed to Ar gas flows (10 cm3/min) on both the feed side and the permeate side at 25–500 °C, followed by a pretreatment in H2 flow to activate the catalyst. Before introducing propane, the reactor was heated to 600 °C and allowed to thermally stabilize for 1 h. A pure propane feed stream on the feed side and a cocurrent Ar sweep flow (1 atm) on the permeate side were then introduced. The permeate side was swept by an Ar flow at atmospheric pressure in the cocurrent flow mode. The flow rates were controlled by mass flow controllers (GFC, Aalborg). The flow rates of the streams exiting the MR were verified by a soap film flow meter. Preheating coils were employed for both the feed and sweep gases to ensure that they reached the set temperature before entering the reactor. To obtain the MR characteristics, the retentate and permeate gases were analyzed by an online GC (Shimadzu GC2014) equipped with a molecular sieve 13× column for the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and an alumina plot column for the flammable ionization detector (FID). A heating or cooling rate of 0.5 °C/min was used. The propylene product, unreacted propane, hydrogen, and the byproducts (methane, ethane, and ethylene) from side reactions such as thermal cracking and catalytic cracking, were analyzed to observe the influence of operating conditions on reaction conversion and selectivity. Minor byproducts, such as higher alkanes and higher olefins (i-butane, n-butane, 1-butene, n-pentane, n-hexane) and aromatics (benzene, xylene, and toluene) were found to be far less than 1% and excluded from further consideration. The propane conversion was calculated based on the total propane feed flow rates entering as feed and exiting the reactor in both the permeate and retentate streams:

where υfeedC3H8 is the volumetric rate of propane in the feed stream at standard temperature and pressure (STP) and mcat is the mass of catalyst. The catalyst used in the PBMR and PBR experiments was 1% Pt/Al2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich) denoted here as “Pt/Al2O3” catalyst. The PBR was made of an impermeable α-alumina disk having the same dimensions as the porous disks used in the CMR and PBMR. For the PBMR and PBR, 1.1 mg of the above catalyst (which contains the equivalent amount of Pt as present in the CMR) was spread evenly over an MFI membrane (PBMR) or impermeable alumina disk (PBR) surface. The amount of catalyst in the PBR was also 1.1 mg. The PDH operating conditions are in Table S1. In the following sections of this paper, the reported MR characteristics correspond to 20 min operation time on-stream for each WHSV. Additionally, one MR was also operated for an extended time of 12 h on-stream with data collection carried out every 12 h.
Results and Discussion
Hybrid MFI-Pt Powder Characterization
Figure S1 shows powder XRD patterns of MFI-Pt zeolite powders were obtained from MPS-containing precursors (Si/Pt ratios of 50 and 100 in the synthesis solution) and a pure-silica MFI powder obtained from MPS-free precursors (Si/Pt ratio of 50 in the synthesis solution). The XRD patterns showed peaks corresponding to crystalline forms of MFI zeolite, which indicate that the presence of MPS precursors did not significantly interfere with the overall hydrothermal crystallization process of MFI. The composition of the hybrid MFI zeolite powders were studied using three different techniques: bulk elemental analysis by ICP mass spectrometry, EDX for microscale analysis (1–2 μm depth), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for nanoscale surface analysis (0.5–4 nm depth). Figure S2 shows the EDX elemental mapping of the MFI-Pt zeolite powders. A uniform distribution of Pt and Si was observed for the hybrid MFI-Pt zeolite powders (HZ and HZ-S) obtained from MPS-containing synthesis solutions, supporting the hypothesis of direct encapsulation of metal precursors during the hydrothermal synthesis. On the other hand, the pure-silica MFI zeolite powder (HZ-N) obtained using an MPS-free synthesis solution showed negligible distribution of Pt metal clusters in the zeolite crystals even though Pt2+ ions were present in the precursor solution. The full set of elemental analyses for the MFI-Pt materials determined by the three different techniques (Table S2) shows that the MFI-Pt particles all have Si/Pt ratios (55–62) close to that present in the initial synthesis solution (50), thereby suggesting that Pt was easily incorporated into the zeolite during the hydrothermal crystallization. The bulk, microscale, and nanoscale surface compositions did not show a significant variation in the Si/Pt ratio, indicating that the Pt distribution was quite uniform. These initial findings were encouraging for the subsequent experiments on incorporation of Pt into MFI membranes.
The electronic structure of the Pt clusters in HZ and HZ-S was inferred from XANES, as shown in Figure 2. The Pt LIII-edge energy for HZ was close to that of the Pt precursor (tetraammine platinum(II) chloride), while the energy for HZ-S showed a similar position to that of Pt foil. A quantitative analysis of the oxidation state of Pt was carried out in a “linear combination fit” ratio using Pt foil and Pt precursor data as standards, yielding ∼32% Pt0/68% Pt2+ in HZ and 77% Pt0/23% Pt2+ in HZ-S. These results suggest that while both materials encapsulated Pt in the form of both reduced Pt as well as Pt2+ ions, the HZ-S material encapsulated a greater fraction of Pt clusters. EXAFS was also used to examine the structure of the Pt clusters in HZ and HZ-S. The Fourier transform of k3-weighted Pt LIII-edge EXAFS showed that both HZ and HZ-S had lower Pt–Pt coordination numbers compared to that of the Pt foil, as their Pt–Pt peak intensities were lower than that of Pt foil. However, HZ-S had a significantly higher Pt–Pt coordination number than HZ, further suggesting that more Pt0 clusters were formed in HZ-S. The Pt clusters in HZ had lower Pt–Pt average coordination number and some Pt stayed in the form of Pt2+ ions, as HZ also displayed a Pt–Cl peak. This could be due to the incomplete decomposition of Pt precursor (tetrammine platinum(II) chloride) during the calcination of HZ.

High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM imaging was used to characterize the Pt cluster size distribution nanostructure of the HZ material before and after calcination. As shown in Figure 3a–3c, single Pt atoms and small Pt clusters up to 2.5 nm in size are present in the as-made materials before calcination. The particle size distributions show that more than 95% of the clusters were smaller than 0.5 nm, that is, comparable to single atoms/ions of Pt and the pore dimensions of MFI. After calcination (Figure 3d–3f) the Pt clusters become broader in size distribution (0.5–2.0 nm) indicating the diffusion of Pt in the pores followed by sintering into larger clusters. For a material such as MFI with a subnanometer pore network, it proved very difficult to obtain structure-quality HAADF-STEM images. However, the Pt cluster size distributions of the calcined HZ materials clearly show that about 50% of the clusters are smaller than 0.75 nm, and thus could possibly be incorporated in the channels of MFI (0.54 × 0.56 nm dimensions) or in the channel intersection cavities (∼0.9 nm) without disrupting the structure. However, there are also larger clusters (>1 nm) that would be expected to locally disrupt the MFI structure, since they cannot be accommodated in the MFI pore structure.

The cluster size distributions are shown as insets.
Hybrid MFI-Pt Membrane Characterization
Since the characterization of the MFI-Pt powder materials revealed promising levels of Pt content and distribution as nanoclusters, we proceeded to extend the synthesis procedure to grow hybrid MFI-Pt zeolite membranes on porous α-alumina disk supports by the secondary (seeded) growth method. The XRD patterns of the calcined hybrid MFI-Pt zeolite membranes are shown in Figure S3, indicating the formation of MFI membranes with (h0l)-orientation in all cases. The characteristic MFI peak positions in the XRD patterns of hybrid zeolite membranes were mostly unchanged compared to the conventional MFI membrane synthesized without Pt ions (Si/Pt = ∞), although changes in several peak intensities as well as peak splittings were observed, presumably due to the incorporation of Pt atoms and clusters. SEM images of the MFI-Pt membranes are shown in Figure 4. Intergrown films are formed in all cases. The thickness of the zeolite layers for Si/Pt = 50 (synthesized at 150 °C for 96 h) and 100 (synthesized at 150 °C for 17 h) was 7–10 μm (Figure 4a, 4b), whereas the conventional MFI membrane (synthesized at 150 °C for 96 h) was 10–15 μm thick (Figure 4c). The cross-sectional and surface microstructure of the MFI-Pt zeolite membranes was similar, but not identical, to that of the conventional membrane.

The spatial distribution of Pt in the zeolite layer was measured using EDX mapping (Figures S4 and 5) of the MFI-Pt membrane grown from a solutions with Si/Pt = 50. As a control, we used an MFI membrane synthesized from a MPS-free solution with the same Si/Pt ratio of 50. As shown in Figure S4, the EDX elemental mapping of the MFI-Pt membrane surface showed the presence of Pt uniformly distributed in the membrane layer (the EDX has a penetration depth of about 1 μm). In contrast, the MPS-free control sample shows negligible (nearly noise-level) Pt signal even though Pt ions were present in the synthesis solution.

Figure 5. Cross-sectional SEM images of (a1–a3) the calcined hybrid MFI zeolite membranes obtained from MPS-containing precursor (HZ-S), (b1–b3) MPS-free precursor (HZ-N), and corresponding EDX elemental mapping (Si and Pt).
Figure 5 shows the EDX elemental mapping of the membrane cross sections. These results confirmed that Pt was incorporated along the entire membrane thickness during the membrane growth with no apparent effect of diffusion limitations. This is an indication that the MPS species efficiently captures Pt species and encapsulates them directly into the pores during the membrane growth. The control sample shows negligible incorporation of Pt. The results are quantitatively depicted in Table 1, which shows that the Si/Pt ratio in the membrane is quite close to that in the initial synthesis solution. A small quantity of sulfur (Pt/S ratio ∼10) remains in the MFI-Pt hybrid membrane synthesized from an MPS-containing solution even after calcination. On the other hand, the HZ-N membranes obtained using MPS-free synthesis solutions showed much higher Si/Pt ratio than the precursor solution. This is due to the absence of MPS, which is required for efficient capture of Pt species and their incorporation into the membrane.

The calcined HZ-S and HZ-N membranes were then microtomed and characterized by TEM and HAADF-STEM imaging. TEM images of the membrane cross sections with Si/Pt ratios of 25, 50, and 100 are shown in Figure 6. The zeolite layer exhibits a typical columnar morphology of a (h0l)-oriented silicalite membrane. Pt clusters are clearly distributed throughout the cross sections of all the membranes synthesized from MPS-containing solutions (Figure 6a–6c). The zeolite membrane synthesized without MPS shows no visible Pt clusters (Figure 6d). HAADF-STEM was used to obtain accurate Pt cluster size distributions from the microtomed membranes. Figure 7 shows that all the visible metal clusters in the hybrid zeolite membrane were distributed in the size range of 0.5–2.0 nm, with about 50% of the clusters smaller than 1.0 nm. HAADF-STEM images further supports the presence of small Pt clusters in the hybrid metal-zeolite membrane layers.

Permeation Properties
After SDA removal, the permeation characteristics of a binary H2/CO2 mixture were measured at room temperature to determine the quality of the membranes. The measurements were conducted at atmospheric pressure with the permeate side swept by an Ar flow. An equimolar H2/CO2 feed with a total flow rate of 20.0 cm3 (STP)/min and an argon sweeping flow rate (FAr) of 20 cm3 (STP)/min were used. As shown in Figure 8a, the membranes exhibited an H2/CO2 separation factor <1, indicating good membrane quality. The gas permeances of the MFI-Pt membranes decreased slightly but significantly as the Si/Pt ratio decreased, presumably due to the transport resistance resulting from encapsulation of the Pt clusters in the structure. The H2/CO2 separation factors were nearly unchanged, which indicates that the Pt clusters do not cause significant disruption in the MFI structure. The permeation characteristics of an equimolar H2/C3H8 feed mixture through the hybrid MFI-Pt membrane with a Si/Pt = 50 are shown in Figure 8b. The H2/C3H8 separation factor and Pm,H2 were measured before the membranes were used in PDH MRs. At 23 °C, the pristine MFI membrane was C3H8-selective because of preferential adsorption. At 650 °C, the MFI membrane exhibited a H2/C3H8 selectivity (αH2/C3H8) of 7 and a high H2 permeance of 2.6 × 10–7 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1, both of which are consistent with the behavior expected from MFI membranes. Thus, it is suggested that the hybrid MFI-Pt membranes, when used as a catalytic membrane reactor (CMR), can provide reasonable H2 separation over propane in addition to performing PDH reactions at elevated temperatures. The PDH reaction behavior is discussed in the next section.

PDH with Hybrid MFI-Pt Zeolite Membranes
To probe the catalytic activity of the hybrid MFI-Pt zeolite membrane, we employed it as a catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) in high-temperature PDH, which was performed at 600 °C and 1 atm using hybrid membranes with Si/Pt ratios of 25, 50, and 100, respectively. In Figure 9a, the propane conversion systematically increased with increasing content of Pt in the membrane. The “blank” sample represents an empty reactor in which only thermal cracking of propane takes place. Increased propylene selectivity is also observed with increasing Pt content (Figure 9b). As expected, the conversion decreases with increasing feed flow rate (corresponding to increased WHSV, from 220 to 1200 h–1).

(a) Propane conversion and (b) propylene selectivity at 600 °C in MFI-Pt CMRs as a function of C3H8 feed flow rate: (■) Si/Pt = 25, (□)Si/Pt = 50, (○)Si/Pt = 100, (△) blank reactor; (c) propane conversion and (d) propylene selectivity at 600 °C as a function of C3H8 feed flow rate in (■) hybrid MFI-Pt CMR (Si/Pt = 50), (□) MFI PBMR, (○) PBR, (×) pure-silica MFI membrane, (△) blank reactor.
In Figure 9c and 9d, we compare the MFI-Pt CMR with the following configurations at 600 °C and 1 atm: a conventional PBMR comprising a pure-silica (Si/Pt = ∞) MFI membrane in contact with a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (with equivalent amount of Pt to the hybrid MFI-Pt membrane), a PBR comprising only the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, a pure-silica MFI membrane, and the blank reactor. As expected, the pure-silica MFI membrane showed negligible catalytic activity above the background thermal cracking obtained from the “blank” reactor. The PBR showed an appreciable increase in conversion and selectivity due to the presence of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. The PBMR showed a further increase in performance over the PBR, owing to the addition of the pure-silica MFI membrane in contact with the catalyst. The hydrogen-selective MFI membrane results in enhanced PDH conversion. The MFI-Pt CMR shows significantly higher conversion and selectivity than both the PBMR and the PBR. This indicates there is more effective utilization of the Pt catalyst in the form of clusters in the hybrid MFI-Pt membrane, and that the further enhancement of propylene selectivity is achieved by the hydrogen-selective membrane. The MFI-Pt zeolite CMR was further tested for high-temperature PDH reactions for an extended time of 12 h at 600 °C with a fixed feed flow rate of 11 cm3/min. As seen in Figure S5a, the propane conversion in the MFI-Pt zeolite CMR was quite stable with only 0.3% decrease after 12 h of operation. Furthermore, the propylene selectivity also remained stable in extended operation whereas the PBMR and PBR showed significant decreases in selectivity (Figure S5b). Finally, we note that the PDH reaction is operated much below equilibrium conditions in both the PBMR and the CMR. This is a “system size” effect caused by the combination of a small membrane/catalyst quantity and the high WHSV. Transfer of the hybrid MFI-Pt membrane synthesis to a tubular geometry, and increase of the CMR thickness to >100 μm, would allow operation at much higher conversions.
Conclusions
A one-step in situ synthesis procedure has been demonstrated to encapsulate Pt metal nanoparticles into microporous MFI zeolite powder crystals and membranes. The morphology of these hybrid MFI-Pt materials/membranes has been elucidated by a combination of experimental techniques. Compositional analyses of membranes and powder crystals show that Pt is uniformly distributed in the zeolite, which also does not show any significant difference in overall crystal structure. TEM and HAADF-STEM imaging show that Pt is present as small clusters of size distribution in the range of 0.5–2 nm after calcination of the zeolite. XANES and EXAFS also indicated that the hybrid MFI-Pt zeolite contained a combination of reduced Pt0 and PtII species (the latter likely in the form of ions of bound to O, Cl, or S atoms). Permeation measurements revealed that the hybrid MFI-Pt membranes have high H2 permeance and exhibited H2 selectivity over propane. High-temperature (600 °C) propane dehydrogenation (PDH) measurements using the hybrid MFI-Pt membrane as a catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) showed its capability to increase both conversion and selectivity relative to a conventional MFI packed-bed membrane reactor (PBMR) as well as a membrane-free packed-bed reactor (PBR), with the latter two reactors both operating with a commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. The hybrid MFI-Pt CMR also displayed good catalytic stability in high-temperature PDH for an extended time of 12 h. Overall, this work describes a useful route to fabricate and characterize zeolite membranes containing encapsulated metallic nanoclusters for applications as membrane reactors and related systems.
