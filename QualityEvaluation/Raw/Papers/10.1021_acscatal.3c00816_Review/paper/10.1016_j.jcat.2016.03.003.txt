•
Coke can be formed via isobutene or via n-butene–butadiene.
Abstract
Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane was investigated over VOx/MCM-41, VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/SiO2–Al2O3 (1–70 wt.% SiO2). The highest selectivity to isobutene of around 85% at isobutane conversion of 50% was achieved over VOx/Al2O3, while all other catalysts were significantly less selective and performed similarly to each other. The lower selectivity obtained on VOx/MCM-41 and VOx/SiO2–Al2O3 is related to their higher activity for isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes as concluded from the results of separate tests with these olefins used as feed components. Our characterization studies suggest that the above isomerization reaction is catalyzed by both, Lewis acidic sites of support and VOx species. Skeletal isomerization activity of the latter depends on their polymerization degree and indirectly affects coke formation because, in addition to isobutene, butadiene formed from n-butenes opens an additional pathway to carbon deposits.

1. Introduction
Isobutene is an important commodity chemical used as a feedstock for production of methyl-tert-butyl ether, methacrylate polymers, butyl rubber and polyisobutene. Commercial production of isobutene is based on steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of high-boiling oil residues. However, market-driven demand rose interest in on-purpose production of this commodity thus placing non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of isobutane to isobutene in focus as a prospective commercial process
[1]
. Despite the fact that several isobutane DH technologies employing Pt–Sn/Al2O3 or CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are successfully applied
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
, improvements in terms of catalyst selectivity, on-stream stability, lifetime, environmental benignity and cost are still due.
The literature on non-oxidative isobutane DH catalysts beyond industrially applied Pt–Sn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3 is sparse but some alternatives have been studied in the past
[1]
. Ni/MgAl2O4 showed ca. 70% selectivity to isobutene at isobutane conversion of only 3%
[4]
. Template-assisted co-condensation of Si and Ga precursors resulted in MCM-41-like mesoporous silica that produced isobutene with the selectivity of 80% at isobutane conversion below 10%, but only of 50% at the conversion of ca. 50%
[5]
. VOx/γ-Al2O3 gave isobutene selectivity in the 80–90% range at isobutane conversion of 20–40%
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
. VOx/θ-Al2O3 was successfully applied in dehydrogenation of n-butane
[9]
,
[10]
. n-Butenes and butadiene were produced with an overall selectivity of 56% at n-butane conversion of 33%
[9]
. When using CO2 as a weak oxidant, Shimada et al.
[11]
reported the selectivity to isobutene of 80% at isobutane conversion of 48% over FeOx supported on activated carbon. Previously, we demonstrated that VOx/MCM-41 prepared by grafting of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) onto MCM-41 silica was active and selective in isobutane
[12]
and propane
[13]
DH under O2-lean conditions as well as in non-oxidative propane DH
[14]
. Extending this preparation method to aluminosilicate supports, we obtained catalysts with a space-time yield of propene only 25% lower than measured on the Pt–Sn/Al2O3 industrial analog
[15]
.
Based on the above background, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the kind of VOx species and of the supports on the catalytic performance (on-stream stability, activity and particularly selectivity) of VOx/SiO2–Al2O3 catalysts in non-oxidative DH of isobutane. To this end, supported VOx species were formed via VO(acac)2 grafting onto silica (MCM-41), aluminosilicate with the weight content of SiO2 between 1 wt.% and 70 wt.% (Siral®) and alumina. In order to understand the role of secondary reactions, we also investigated activity and selectivity of the catalysts and the corresponding pristine supports in isobutene and 1-butene conversion. The distribution of VOx species and acidic properties of the materials were elucidated by UV–vis and Raman spectroscopy as well as by infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine respectively. These characterization data were instrumental in establishing a correlation between structure and performance of the VOx-based catalysts in isobutane DH. They also helped to explain the differences between isobutane and propane DH over the same type of catalysts tested in this study and in our previous study
[15]
respectively.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Silica (MCM-41), SiO2–Al2O3 (Siral®, Sasol, SiO2 content between 1 wt.% and 70 wt.%), and alumina (Chempur, Karlsruhe) were used as support materials. MCM-41 was synthesized following the procedure described in
[16]
. The catalysts were prepared by grafting VO(acac)2 from a toluene solution onto supports as previously described
[15]
. Briefly, the dried support material was stirred in the toluene solution of VO(acac)2 at room temperature for 24 h. After filtration, the solid was washed twice in pure toluene, dried at 80 °C for 20 h and calcined in static air at 550 °C for 12 h. To increase V loading, the above procedure was repeated. The obtained catalysts are abbreviated in the following text as V/Si, V/S1, V/S10, V/S40, V/S70 and V/Al, while the corresponding supports are denoted as SiO2, S1, S10, S40, S70 and Al2O3. The numbers stand for the weight concentration of SiO2 in SiO2–Al2O3.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The specific surface area (SBET) of the supports and calcined catalysts was determined from N2 adsorption isotherms measured at 77 K on BELSORP mini II (BEL, Japan) applying the Brunauer, Emmet and Teller (BET) equation for relative pressure range of 0.05 < p/p0 < 0.30. The obtained SBET values are listed in

The V content in the calcined catalysts (
Table 1
) was determined by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on Varian 715-ES.
To analyze the distribution of supported VOx species, UV–vis measurements were performed at 550 °C in air that replicates the pretreatment applied prior to the catalytic experiments. A temperature-resistant UV–vis probe consisting of six radiating and one reading optical fibers was threaded through an oven’s heating mantle and brought in contact with quartz reactor containing a catalyst. The spectra were collected in a diffusive reflectance mode on AVASPEC spectrometer equipped with DH-2000 deuterium-halogen light source (both from Avantes). BaSO4 was used as a white standard. Kubelka–Munk function
was calculated from the reflectance
according to Eq.

The surface acidity of the catalysts as well as of the pristine supports was assessed by infrared (IR) measurements of adsorbed pyridine using Tensor 27 spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with an in-house developed in situ cell. The sample powders were pressed into self-supporting wafers (50 mg, 20 mm in diameter). The samples were heated in synthetic air at 400 °C for 10 min, cooled to 25 °C and evacuated. Hereafter, pyridine was adsorbed until saturation was reached. Then the reaction cell was again evacuated to remove physisorbed pyridine. After heating in vacuum to 250 °C, the IR spectra of the adsorbed pyridine were recorded. Brønsted acidity and Lewis acidity were quantified by integrating the typical bands at 1540 cm−1 and 1450 cm−1, respectively. Before IR tests with reduced catalysts, selected materials were treated in a flow of 5 vol.% H2 in Ar at 550 °C for 6 h. After cooling down in the same gas mixture to room temperature the samples were transferred to the IR cell and again heated in a H2/He = 5/95 mixture to 400 °C for 10 min followed by cooling to 25 °C and evacuation. Pyridine adsorption and IR measurement were carried out as described above for oxidized catalysts.
The Raman microspectroscopic investigations were performed on a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope equipped with a Linkam reaction cell. The ceramic reactor was filled with 40–50 mg of the catalyst. The samples were heated in He (50 ml/min) up to 250 °C with a heating rate of 20 K/min, where the Raman spectra were recorded. For the measurements a 442 nm laser was used with a laser power of 10% (Dual He/Cd Laser, 80/20 mW, objective 20×, acquisition time 10 s).
The redox behavior of oxidized VOx species was analyzed by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in a setup containing eight individually heated continuous-flow fixed-bed reactors
[17]
. Fresh catalysts were heated in air at 550 °C for 2 h to oxidize VOx species and to remove adsorbed water. After cooling to 50 °C in the same flow, they were flushed with Ar for 15 min and then heated in a flow of 5 vol.% H2 in Ar at 10 K min−1 to the final temperature of 900 °C. The following atomic mass units (AMUs) were analyzed with a frequency of about 1 s−1: 2 (H2), 18 (H2O) and 40 (Ar).
2.3. Catalytic tests
Catalytic tests were carried out in an in-house developed setup containing 15 continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactors (3.8 mm inner diameter) operating in parallel and heated in a single oven. The catalysts and supports (300 mg per reactor, particle size of 315–710 μm) were initially heated in air at 5 K min−1 to 550 °C and held at this temperature for 50 min. After flushing with nitrogen for 20 min, the reaction gas mixture (isobutane: nitrogen = 40: 60) was fed at a modified gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 1200 L h−1 kg−1cat and a pressure of 1.23 bar for a total reaction time of 27 h. After the test, the catalysts were cooled to room temperature in a flow of N2. To investigate the effect of isobutane conversion on product selectivity, additional tests were performed at other modified GHSV to obtain different degrees of conversion. To this end, we varied catalyst amount (50–1000 mg), while the total flow was kept constant. Also, experiments with reduced catalysts (1 h in a flow of 30 vol.% H2 in N2 at 550 °C before DH reaction) were performed to study the influence of VOx oxidation state on catalysts selectivity.
Pristine supports and catalysts were tested for their activity and selectivity in isobutene and 1-butene conversion at 550 °C and 1.23 bar using an olefin: nitrogen = 10: 90 mixture. To attain different degrees of conversion, the measurements were performed at different modified GHSV.
The concentration of feed components and reaction products was measured by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890) equipped with PoraplotQ (for CO2 and water), HP-PLOT Al2O3”KCl” (for methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propene, n-butane, isobutane, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, 1-butene, isobutene, butadiene) and Molsieve 5 (for H2, N2, CO) capillary columns and flame ionization (for hydrocarbons) and thermal conductivity (for other products) detectors. The isobutane conversion and selectivity to gas-phase products were calculated according to Eqs.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Materials characterization
Selected physicochemical properties of the catalysts and pristine supports are presented in
Table 1
. Analyzing specific surface areas of the supports and V loading on the respective catalysts, one can notice that SiO2 with SBET of 900 m2 g−1 anchored lower absolute amount of V than SiO2–Al2O3 materials with SBET ranging between 255 and 475 m2 g−1. This apparent discrepancy may arise from different anchoring mechanisms of VO(acac)2 to silica and alumina. Attachment of VO(acac)2 to silanol groups of silica happens via relatively weak hydrogen bonding
[18]
,
[19]
. It is reversible and is in equilibrium with VO(acac)2 in the solution which limits the amount of V precursor adsorbed on the SiO2 surface. As a consequence, during the washing steps some vanadium is lost from the surface. At higher temperature, during calcination, SiOV bonds are formed. In contrast to silica, both basic hydroxyl groups and coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ sites on alumina are involved in the reaction with VO(acac)2 resulting in (AlO)2VO species
[19]
,
[20]
that are converted to AlOV bonds upon calcination. Depending on their surface density, either isolated sites or polymerized VOx species connected via VOV bonds are created. For all catalysts the apparent surface density of V calculated assuming 100% dispersion (
Table 1
) was lower than the theoretical value for a monolayer of isolated VOx of 2.5 V nm−2
[21]
,
[22]
and well below 10 V nm−2 calculated for a two-dimensional polyvanadate layer
[21]
. Thus, formation of isolated VOx sites on all catalysts studied in our current work is theoretically possible but much more probable for V/Si having the lowest surface density of 0.5 V nm−2 (
Table 1
).
A comparison of the UV–vis spectra recorded in a flow of air at 550 °C for all catalysts is shown in
Fig. 1
. Such treatment was important to ensure the highest oxidation state of vanadium and to remove water from its coordination sphere. The spectrum of V/Si shows the lowest absorption edge among the catalysts at a wavelength of ca. 440 nm. For all other catalysts, this value is shifted to higher wavelengths in the 500–530 nm range. This shift indicates that these catalysts possess VOx species of a higher degree of polymerization than those on the surface of V/Si

Table 1
).
To shed more light on the nature of supported VOx species and especially on their degree of polymerization we characterized selected catalysts strongly differing in their UV–vis spectra by Raman spectroscopy. Raman bands between 1000 and 1040 cm−1 can be assigned to the VO-stretching vibration (
Fig. S1
). Polyvanadate species with VOV bonds should display bands at 920, 800 and 600 cm−1
[24]
,
[25]
. However, such bands could not be properly identified in the Raman spectra of the catalysts (
Fig. S1
). The absence of a sharp Raman band at ∼994 cm−1, with its multiple associated sharp bands at lower wavenumbers, demonstrates that crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not present in our samples (
Fig. S1
). Combining these results with the UV–vis spectra in
Fig. 1
we can arrange our catalysts with respect to the degree of polymerization of VOx species as follows: V/Si ≈ V/S40 < V/S70 < V/S10 < V/S1 ≈ V/Al. This order is generally in agreement with the increasing V surface density.
H2-TPR tests with initially oxidized catalysts support our conclusion from the above UV–vis and Raman analysis about the kind of supported VOx species. The temperature of maximal H2 consumption (Tmax), which qualitatively reflects reducibility of the supported VOx species, increases with SiO2 content in the support (
Fig. S2
). This means that highly dispersed VOx sites on V/Si are harder to reduce compared to the two-dimensional polymerized VOx species on samples containing Al in the support. Tmax of V/S1 lies at somewhat higher temperature than that of V/Al suggesting that VOx species on the two catalysts have different degree of polymerization as was concluded from the UV–vis spectra in
Fig. 1
. Analyzing the TPR profiles further, one can notice that the peak of H2 consumption over V/Si is symmetric, i.e. produced by a single type of reducible species. The H2-TPR profiles of V/S1 and V/Al exhibit lower temperature shoulders evidencing the presence of VOx species with varying reducibility. Lower reduction temperature is characteristic of two-dimensional VOx species with higher degree of polymerization which is again in agreement with the results of UV–vis analysis. Finally, all catalysts were reduced at considerably lower temperature than bulk V2O5 suggesting that do not possess such crystalline structures.
The surface acidity both of oxidized and reduced catalysts as well as oxidized pristine supports was determined by FTIR spectroscopy using pyridine as a basic probe molecule.
Table 1
contains the calculated amounts of pyridine adsorbed on Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites, as determined from integration of the corresponding IR bands of adsorbed pyridine at 250 °C (
Fig. S3
). No Brønsted sites were found on all pristine supports and V/Al, while such sites were identified on oxidized V/Si and all catalysts based on SiO2–Al2O3 where they must have been originated from VOx species. Detection of Brønsted sites on V/Si confirms findings made by Piumetti et al.
[26]
who observed Brønsted acidity on SBA-15 silica with supported VOx. The difference between V/Al and all other catalysts possessing Si in the support can be explained by the electronegativity of Si that is higher than that of V which weakens OH bonds connected to V. In contrast, V and Al possess nearly the same electronegativity and consequently no Brønsted acidity is created. After reduction of the supported VOx catalysts at 550 °C in H2, Brønsted acidity of V/Si nearly disappears whereas that of V/SiO2-Al2O3 is still present. The reason for such behavior is not clear.
As expected, bare MCM-41 silica did not possess Lewis sites, while such sites were identified on the surface of all Al-containing supports. Grafting VOx species resulted in an increase in the number of such sites with the highest effect being determined for V/Si. Their concentration, however, decreased or even completely disappeared (V/Si) after the catalysts were reduced in H2 (
Table 1
). Hence, both Brønsted acidity and Lewis acidity of V/Si originate from its VOx species. Finally, a certain fraction of Lewis acidic sites on pristine Al2O3 and SiO2–Al2O3 was consumed upon binding of VO(acac)2 during grafting. Hence, Lewis acidity of the corresponding catalysts must originate from both V-free surfaces of the supports and VOx species.
3.2. Intrinsic activity and on-stream performance in isobutane dehydrogenation
Fig. 2
(a) shows isobutane conversion at 550 °C as a function of time on stream. The highest initial conversion of about 52% was achieved over V/Si. It continuously decreased to around 25% during 27 h on stream. The conversion on all Al-containing catalysts was lower but passed through a maximum at early time on stream. After this initial phase, they also deactivated with a higher rate than V/Si as obvious from the descending parts of the conversion curves (
Fig. 2
(a)). Despite its high on-stream stability, V/Si showed only around 48% initial (after ca. 0.5 h on stream) isobutene selectivity, which slightly increased with time on stream because the conversion of isobutane decreased (
Fig. 2
(b)). All other Si-containing catalysts did not differ from V/Si in terms of their initial selectivity. However, it increased stronger with time on stream since the conversion decreased stronger. It is important to highlight that the initial selectivity of above 90% was achieved over V/Al and only slightly decreased during 27 h DH run. Such distinctive behavior on this catalyst cannot be explained by the effect of conversion on the selectivity because it showed similar or even superior isobutane conversion compared to the catalysts based on SiO2–Al2O3.

To compare the catalysts in terms of the intrinsic activity of VOx species, we calculated the initial rate of isobutane conversion per V atom, i.e. apparent TOF (
Table 1
), from the conversion degrees presented in
Fig. 2
using Eqs.
(5)
,
(6)
,
(7)
. Based on this characteristic, V/Si is the most active material, while the activity of VOx species on other supports was lower and did not vary with the support. Recalling that such species in the latter catalysts are more condensed than in V/Si and V/S70, we hypothesize that the degree of polymerization of VOx is an important factor influencing their catalytic activity. It is worth repeating that the catalysts strongly differ in initial isobutene selectivity. However, no correlation between the TOF values and the selectivity could be established. What are the factors influencing the desired selectivity? We attempt to answer this question in the next section, where we present and discuss the results of catalytic tests at different degrees of isobutane conversion over V/Si, V/S10, and V/Al selected according to the kind of VOx species and support.
3.3. Primary and secondary reaction pathways in isobutane dehydrogenation
Two series of experiments were performed with initially oxidized or prereduced catalysts to check whether the DH performance of VOx depends on the oxidation state of vanadium. Selectivity-conversion plots showing the data measured within the first hour on stream are shown in
Fig. 3
. No significant difference between the preoxidized and prereduced catalysts was observed thus suggesting that oxidized VOx species were reduced within the first minutes of exposure to the reaction feed, i.e. before the first data point was measured. Isobutene selectivity on all catalysts dropped with increasing conversion as a result of its consecutive transformations. Irrespective of the degree of isobutane conversion, V/Al showed higher isobutene selectivity than V/Si and V/S10 with the last two performing very similar to each other. Moreover, the latter two catalysts were significantly more active for consecutive isobutene transformations than V/Al as follows from the slope of isobutene selectivity profiles in
Fig. 3
.

Linear butenes should be the main products formed from isobutene. Compared with V/Si and V/S10, this isomerization reaction is nearly not happening on V/Al. Butadiene and n-butane were another C4 side products formed, however, in significantly lower amounts than n-butenes (
Fig. 3
). Direct isomerization of isobutane to n-butane can be excluded because the selectivity to this product approaches zero at zero isobutane conversion and increases with the conversion. A similar dependence is valid for the selectivity to butadiene. From a mechanistic viewpoint, n-butane and butadiene should be formed through hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of n-butenes respectively. This statement is indirectly supported by the fact that there is a correlation between the selectivity to n-butenes and n-butane/butadiene. The latter products were practically not formed over V/Al, which was not efficient for isobutene isomerization to n-butenes.
Cracking products (methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propene) and coke were formed over all catalysts with the selectivity arranging them as V/Si ≈ V/S10 > V/Al (
Fig. 3
). The fact that the selectivity to these products increased with isobutane conversion suggests that they are formed mainly from isobutene and possibly from n-butenes through consecutive reactions. However, direct isobutane cracking must be another pathway leading to C1C3 hydrocarbons as can be concluded from the fact that nonzero selectivity is expected at zero degree of isobutane conversion.
3.4. Catalytic performance in isobutene conversion
To further elucidate the effect of support and the kind of VOx species on isobutene transformations, we performed tests with the catalysts and the pristine supports at the same temperature as in the isobutane DH experiments but using a feed containing 10 vol.% isobutene in N2. This concentration was selected because it is close to the one measured in the effluent flow of isobutane DH over V/Si at early time on stream. No reaction products were observed over SiO2, while all other supports converted isobutene mainly to n-butenes and coke and to a minor extent to cracking products, butanes and butadiene. This strongly suggests that acidic sites on the surface of the Al-containing supports (
Table 1
) were responsible for isobutene conversion. However, the intrinsic activity of acid sites appears to depend on the support. This assumption is based on the fact that S10 possessing only 3 times higher number of acidic sites than Al2O3 showed approximately 20 times higher rate of isobutene consumption determined at 30–40% conversion (
Table 2
).

). The contrast is especially dramatic for V/Si converting isobutene with the rate of 1.7 μmol g−1 s−1 vs. zero activity of MCM-41. V/Al was also more active than pure Al2O3. Since SiO2 was not active for isobutene conversion but V/Si converted this olefin, we can safely conclude that surface VOx are the catalytically active species. They should also be responsible for the higher conversion rate over V/Al compared to Al2O3. This difference in the activity may have origins in the higher concentration of VOx species in V/Al than that of acidic sites in pristine Al2O3 and/or in the intrinsically higher activity of the former. In contrast to V/Si and V/Al, the conversion rate over V/S10 was lower than over the corresponding support. This result can be explained by higher intrinsic activity of the support acidic sites than that of the VOx species. The concentration of the former decreased after deposition of VOx species thus resulting in a lower rate of isobutene conversion.
It is worth to further analyze how the kind of active sites influences the product selectivity. The acidic sites of Al-containing supports mainly catalyzed isobutene isomerization to n-butenes and to a lesser extent oligomerization reactions leading to surface carbonaceous deposits (
Table 2
). Cracking products, butadiene and butanes were formed in significantly lower amounts. Butanes originated from hydrogenation of isobutene and n-butenes with hydrogen produced in cracking and/or coking reactions. Compared to the acidic sites on the respective supports, VOx species on the surface of V/Al and V/S10 were less selective to n-butenes but showed higher selectivity to carbon deposits.
To understand the pathways of product formation from isobutene over the catalysts, we performed additional tests at different degrees of isobutene conversion. The obtained selectivity-conversion plots are shown in
Fig. 4
. The selectivity to n-butenes over V/Si and V/S10 slightly decreased with increasing conversion, while the selectivity to coke and cracking products followed the opposite trend. Such dependence suggests that the latter two were partly formed from n-butenes, which primarily originated from isobutene. The selectivity to n-butenes over V/Al was always substantially lower than over V/Si and V/S10 and changed little with conversion. Instead, the selectivity to coke was much higher than over the other two catalysts. In fact, extrapolated to zero isobutene conversion, coke selectivity amounts to 70% suggesting a direct conversion of the educt to coke. The corresponding values for V/Si and V/S10 were around 20% and 30%. Based on these data and on the effect of isobutene conversion on coke selectivity, we can conclude that both isobutene and n-butenes contribute to the formation of coke over V/Si and V/S10. Owing to low isomerization activity of V/Al, coke formation from n-butenes is strongly suppressed on this catalyst. Butadiene can be formed by dehydrogenation of n-butenes. Consequently, it is formed to a lesser extent over V/Al that possesses low activity for isobutene isomerization to n-butenes. Interestingly, butadiene selectivity seems to be nonzero at zero degree of isobutene conversion what is especially true for V/Si. This can be explained by a direct conversion of isobutene to n-butenes followed by dehydrogenation of the latter without desorption and the higher intrinsic dehydrogenation activity of the dispersed VOx species on V/Si compared to V/Al or V/S10 (see
Table 1
). The selectivity to isobutane is relatively high over all catalysts. It can be formed by hydrogenation of isobutene with hydrogen generated in cracking and coke formation reactions. In contrast, the selectivity to n-butane that is formed by hydrogenation of n-butenes, is below 3% over all catalysts.

3.5. Catalytic performance in 1-butene conversion
We also studied transformations of 1-butene as an example of consecutive reactions of n-butene isomers formed through isobutene isomerization in the course of isobutane DH. Reaction conditions were the same as used in the isobutene tests described in Section
3.4
. Since the double bond shift resulting in 2-butenes occurs easily over all catalysts at the reaction temperature of 550 °C, the ratios between the three n-butenes are constant at all conversion degrees. Therefore, 2-butenes were not accounted for in calculations of product selectivity and instead of 1-butene conversion we report n-butene conversion. The consumption rate of n-butene and the selectivity to formed reaction products at a conversion of around 30% are given in
Table 3
. For all catalysts this rate is somewhat higher than the rate of isobutene conversion (
Table 2
).

As evident from the selectivity-conversion plots shown in
Fig. 5
, isomerization activity of V/Al was much lower than that of V/Si and V/S10 as reflected by the selectivity to isobutene. It is also important to highlight that the primary (extrapolated to zero n-butene conversion) selectivity to isobutene was significantly lower than the respective selectivity to butadiene. This difference proves that the rate of n-butene dehydrogenation to the latter product is significantly higher than the rate of n-butene isomerization to isobutene. Butadiene selectivity strongly dropped with rising conversion of n-butene whereas the selectivity to coke and cracking products increased. This indicates that these two products are mainly formed from butadiene in a secondary reaction but hardly from n-butene. Butadiene is also more reactive than isobutene as follows from the weak dependence of isobutene selectivity on n-butene conversion.

3.6. Mechanistic network of isobutane DH
The above results are now discussed to elaborate structure–selectivity relationships in the isobutane DH reaction over catalysts possessing highly dispersed or oligomerized VOx species on the surface of differently acidic supports. Based on the selectivity-conversion relationships in
Fig. 3
,
Fig. 4
,
Fig. 5
, we developed a mechanistic scheme considering both primary and consecutive reaction pathways in the course of isobutane DH (
Scheme 1
). The highest primary isobutene selectivity of nearly 100% was obtained over V/Al, while V/Si and V/S10 performed with lower selectivity (ca. 85%). The difference is due to the catalyst ability for isobutane cracking, which is another primary reaction pathway.

Scheme 1. Proposed mechanistic scheme of product formation in isobutane and propane DH. Main reaction paths are marked in bold.
Directing the focus to secondary reactions, we will begin the discussion with mechanistic aspects of cracking, coke formation and isomerization (
Scheme 1
). The present study revealed two pathways of coke formation differing in the kind of gas-phase precursors, which are isobutene and butadiene originated from dehydrogenation of isobutane and n-butenes respectively. Importantly, n-butenes do not directly contribute to coke formation because they are dehydrogenated faster to butadiene (see the zero coke selectivity at zero conversion in
Fig. 5
). For V/Al, coke is formed directly from isobutene, while another reaction pathway with participation of n-butenes is suppressed because of low catalyst activity for skeletal isomerization. In contrast to this catalyst, V/Si and V/S10 are very active for isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes and their subsequent conversion to butadiene. Formation of the latter opens a second pathway of coke formation via butadiene. For all catalysts, the selectivity to coke formed from isobutene or n-butenes is significantly higher than in isobutane DH (
Fig. 4
and
Figs. 5
vs.
4
). Moreover, the order of catalysts for coke formation is also different, i.e. V/Al showed the lowest coke selectivity in isobutane DH, but was one of the most selective in isobutene and 1-butene conversion. To explain this discrepancy, we put forward that the reaction pathways of coke formation are influenced by isobutane. If isobutane dehydrogenation and oligomerization of olefins take place on the same active sites coke formation from isobutene will be partially suppressed in excess of isobutane. This assumption of a common site for the two reactions is supported by the fact that VOx species actively participate in coke formation as demonstrated in the present study (
Fig. 6
) and in our recent article on propane DH
[27]
. The strength of such effect will depend on the rates of coke formation and isobutane DH. On V/Si and V/S10 showing high activity for skeletal isobutene isomerization the second pathway of coke formation prevails, that is via n-butenes and butadiene. Moreover, this pathway appears to be faster than coke formation from isobutene as indicated by more coke deposits on catalysts that are more active in isomerization (
Fig. 6
).

Fig. 6. Rates of isobutene conversion to n-butenes (black), coke (gray) and cracking products (white) determined at around 30% isobutene conversion at 550 °C.
Now, we turn the view to the selectivity to isomerization and cracking products over the catalysts/pristine supports. Importantly, these products were formed at higher rates over S10 than over alumina and silica; V/Si and V/S10 were more active in these reactions than V/Al (
Fig. 6
). Skeletal isomerization of isobutene is known to be catalyzed by acidic sites, and Brønsted acidic sites can be more active in this reaction than Lewis sites
[28]
. Bearing this in mind, the distinctive performance of V/S10 and V/Al for the isomerization reaction can be explained by the acidity of these catalysts (
Table 1
). However, V/Si pretreated in H2 at reaction temperature does not possess acidic sites but shows high selectivity to n-butenes (
Fig. 3
,
Fig. 4
). Therefore, acidity alone as determined by pyridine adsorption at 250 °C (
Table 1
) is not the only factor governing catalyst activity for skeletal isomerization. Based on these results, we suggest that the degree of polymerization of VOx species also influences isomerization activity: the higher the degree, the lower the activity. To validate this hypothesis, we prepared a V/Si catalyst with an apparent vanadium surface density of 0.05 V nm−2. According to UV–vis analysis, this catalyst possesses practically isolated VOx species in comparison with the V/Si catalyst with 0.5 V nm−2 (
Fig. S4
). Since no acidic sites are present on the surface of bare SiO2, we can safely compare the ability of isolated and slightly polymerized VOx species for skeletal isomerization.
Fig. 7
shows the selectivity-conversion plot in isobutane DH over these two V/Si catalysts. One can clearly see that the selectivity to isobutene over isolated VOx species was lower and decreased with rising isobutane conversion stronger than over their slightly polymerized counterparts. Thus, the degree of polymerization of VOx should play an important role in skeletal isobutene isomerization. In addition we cannot exclude that this non-desired reaction can be affected by the presence of VOSi or AlOSi bonds on the catalysts containing SiO2 in the support. Compared to VOAl or AlOAl, they alter electronic properties of the catalysts and supports by introducing Si with the electronegativity higher than that of V and Al.

Comparing the trends in selectivity of the same VOx-based catalysts tested previously in DH of propane
[15]
to the trends in the present study in isobutane DH, one sees remarkable differences. In the former reaction, the initial selectivity to propene over V/Si and V/Al was ca. 90%, whereas VOx supported on various SiO2–Al2O3 were less selective (<80%). In isobutane DH, V/Al also showed the highest desired selectivity, while this selectivity over V/Si was significantly lower and close to that over V/S10 (
Fig. 3
). Such change in the performance of V/Si is attributed to different pathways of the side-product formation from propane and isobutane (
Scheme 1
). Propane can be cracked to methane and ethylene which are the main side products in propane DH, whereas isomerization of primarily formed isobutene to n-butenes can additionally take place in the course of isobutane DH. Such olefins are dehydrogenated to butadiene, which easily results in coke formation thus drastically reducing isobutene selectivity over V/Si and V/S10 but not over V/Al as discussed above.
4. Conclusions
Catalysts testing in combination with their characterization delivered novel fundamental insights into isobutane dehydrogenation over supported VOx-containing catalysts. The degree of polymerization of VOx species and surface acidity are viewed to be essential catalyst properties influencing skeletal isomerization of isobutene and thus indirectly affecting its selectivity. Additional tests of isobutene and 1-butene conversion over the same catalysts revealed that different mechanisms of coke formation coexist in isobutane DH. For the V/Al catalyst, coke is mainly formed from isobutene on the same active sites that are responsible for isobutane DH. As a consequence, coke formation is partially suppressed in the presence of isobutane. In contrast, the main gas-phase precursor of coke over the catalysts with SiO2 in the support is butadiene formed through dehydrogenation of n-butenes. This reaction does not seem to be hindered by isobutane. A balance between these two pathways of coke formation is determined by catalyst ability to isomerize the target product isobutene to n-butenes.
