Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production, which has received extensive attention and realized large-scale application. At present, the commercial Pt/Cr-based catalysts suffer from fast deactivation and inferior stability resulting from active species sintering and coke depositing. To overcome the above problems, several strategies such as the modification of the support and the introduction of additives have been proposed to strengthen the catalytic performance and prolong the robust stability of Pt/Cr-based catalysts. This review firstly gives a brief description of the development of PDH and PDH catalysts. Then, the advanced research progress of supported noble metals and non-noble metals together with metal-free materials for PDH is systematically summarized along with the material design and active origin as well as the existing problems in the development of PDH catalysts. Furthermore, the review also emphasizes advanced synthetic strategies based on novel design of PDH catalysts with improved dehydrogenation activity and stability. Finally, the future challenges and directions of PDH catalysts are provided for the development of their further industrial application.

1. Introduction
Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications. However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116 000 000 tons in 2020.1 The traditional propylene production process includes steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light alkane, and crude oil byproducts by other processes. However, there still exist vast obstacles such as the low target selectivity of olefins, restricted fossil energy resources, and insufficient market supply, which make it urgent to develop new processes to achieve valuable propylene. Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), Fischer–Tropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention.2–4 Methanol steam reforming and coal gasification reaction are highly exothermic and the initiation phase demands lots of energy consumption, leading to an aggravated greenhouse effect.5 Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products.6 Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane.7
The production of olefins from propane could be simply classified into three categories as follows: (1) reaction without an oxidant involved in propane dehydrogenation, simply designated as direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene; (2) oxygen or air jointly involved in dehydrogenation, denoted as PDH-O2; and (3) carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant or hydrogen serving as feeding gas, named CO2/H2 mediated dehydrogenation (PDH-CO2/PDH-H2).4 It should be noted that the catalysis of the dehydrogenation of propane concerning oxides as reactants is hardly constrained by a thermodynamic equivalent. In contrast, the direct dehydrogenation along with H2 as a reactant involved in the reaction process is restricted by thermodynamic balance.5 What's more, the prime bottlenecks of PDH-O2 during commercial application can be concluded as follows: (1) the conversion rate and selectivity of PDH are too small to achieve practical industrial utilization; meanwhile, the incomplete reaction of alkanes needs to be recycled using a pure oxide, resulting in increased cost and energy consumption. (2) Due to the competition of adsorption, the introduction of oxides might sharply weaken the interaction between the active center and propane, leading to a low propane conversion and poor propene selectivity.6 Modern process technology mainly includes Catofin, Oleflex, STAR, Linde, FBD-4, ADHO, FCDh and K-PROt processes for prolonged periods of time (Fig. 1).8 Among them, the most widely applicable processes are Oleflex and Catofin processes, in which catalysts consist of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, respectively.8,9

At present, the widely used Pt-based catalysts are limited by their high price, low abundance, and serious particle agglomeration caused by high reaction temperature during the synthesis process. Thus, there is an urgent need to utilize a regeneration process, involving harmful Cl2 or chlorine-containing compounds, to redistribute the active species in supporting materials, achieving a comparable performance to fresh catalysts.10 Moreover, CrOx-based catalysts exhibit an outstanding performance in the commercial process, but Cr4+ reaction intermediates are detrimental to human health,5 and the repetitive utilization of CrOx-based catalysts also can be constrained by fast deactivation of catalytic activity as a result of irreversible sintering on active components. As a result, it is of great significance to synthesize a series of advanced catalysts possessing an eco-friendly character, cost-effective nature, excellent anti-coking properties, long-term stability and robust recyclable life, which are beneficial for further practical applications. Taking Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts as example, it is still a great challenge to realize long-time stability and anti-coking capability of catalysts via conventional methods. In order to improve the lifetime and anti-coking property, tremendous efforts have been devoted to inhibiting the agglomeration of active metal species, regulating the distribution of effective components, and optimizing the electron effect.11,12 Hence, other desirable strategies such as strong metal–support interaction (SMSI), alloying with a non-noble metal, and combinations of effective approaches has been used to develop advanced Pt-based catalysts. In addition, a wide variety of non-noble metal materials such as Fe, Co, Ru, Rh, Zn, V, Ga, W, and Zr-based dehydrogenation catalysts also have been intensively explored, which exhibit excellent performance serving as promising candidates as catalysts for PDH, but still many problems are unsolved.13–21
In this review, a comprehensive overview of the research progress and future prospects for PDH catalysts will be given. Firstly, the recent advances in Pt-based, CrOx-based and other non-noble metal based PDH catalysis are summarized in categories. In particular, we also highlight the developing technologies of catalyst preparation, the interaction effect among structure–activity–selectivity, and advanced synthetic strategies for high-performance catalysts. Finally, perspectives on future developments are also presented to expand the exploration of novel PDH catalysts for industrial applications.
2. Simplified overview of PDH
PDH is a typical highly endothermic reaction process, which requires an elevated temperature to realize a reasonable propane conversion (ΔH
θ
298K
= 124 KJ mol−1).22 The reaction equation (C3H8 ↔ C3H6 + H2) reveals its economic efficiency with the generation of high-valued products by using only propane reactants. Based upon the thermodynamics, the single-pass conversion could be raised by increasing the reaction temperature and reducing the partial pressure of propane reactants and H2 products. However, it is almost impossible to totally achieve a theoretical state, which has led to an urgent need to choose outstanding catalysts and applies the optimized reaction conditions to achieve desired propane conversion. Li et al. proposed that the conversion of propane is a function of reaction temperature and pressure (Fig. 2).6 As displayed in Fig. 2a, the propane conversion apparently showed a positive relationship with the increased reaction temperature ranging from 500 to 700 °C. Once the temperature surpassed 630 °C, serious parasitic reactions such as cracking reaction and coking behavior occurred and the propene selectivity evidently decreased.

In order to elucidate the crucial effect of temperature on the reaction activity of PDH catalysts, Zhang and colleagues used a series of catalysts (Pt–Sn(i), 20 wt% CrOx/Al2O3, and Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 catalysts) for catalyzing PDH under the same conditions with the temperature ranging from 500 to 625 °C. This study revealed that the higher temperature favored the conversion of C3H8.23 However, the selectivity to target alkenes apparently decreased with the increased temperature caused by more serious side reactions. In a similar study, Zhu et al. used 5Zn/S-1 catalysts for the PDH process at a temperature of 500 to 575 °C.24 The results indicated that the conversion of C3H8 and the selectivity of C3H6 presented particular trends as a function of temperature. More specifically, the PDH reaction with an elevated temperature exhibited higher C3H8 conversion along with an inferior C3H6 selectivity, which was attributed to the deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions. Therefore, a suitable temperature is useful in realizing propylene productivity and exerts a great influence on the industrial practice. As presented in Fig. 2b, the propane conversion decreased with the augmented reaction partial pressure at 600 °C. Therefore, propane conversion and propene selectivity could be drastically improved by reducing the partial pressure of propane. However, once the reaction pressure is below the atmosphere pressure, there exists a leaking problem, which brings great challenges to practical applications.25 Furthermore, it is rational that the single-pass conversion could be elevated by decreasing the partial pressure of the H2 product, but the practical application process temporarily lacks a gas separation unit to achieve that goal. On the other hand, the H2 product could act as an additive to help redisperse the sintering metal species and restrict the corresponding side reactions, thus prolonging the lifetime of catalysts and reducing the process cost.6 Otroshchenko et al. performed a comprehensive investigation concerning propane conversion as a function of the contents of propane feeds at a fixed temperature and pressure (Fig. 2c).5 The results showed a negative trend with the increase in propane contents. As a result, it is necessary to ascertain the reaction conditions of the dehydrogenation of propane according to the trend of propane conversion with the change of reaction conditions to start the dehydrogenation reaction.
It is worth mentioning that the intermediates and propene products of dehydrogenation reaction easily induce a deep cracking process to generate coke (Fig. 3).26 This will inevitably decrease the propane conversion and propene selectivity, resulting in fast deactivation, short-term lifetime, and frequent regeneration. Hence, developing catalysts to inhibit coke and improve stability, activity, and selectivity has been a focus of research in propane dehydrogenation. Although a great deal of catalysts have been investigated, critical bottlenecks such as coking, sintering agglomeration, high cost, and unsettled environmental problems still greatly restrict their applications and the performance urgently requires further improvement.

3. Development of PDH catalysts
In this section, a comprehensive description of the development of PDH catalysts as well as a detailed summary of research progress will be provided. The traditional supported metal-based catalysts for PDH heavily depend on the microstructure of active components and the interaction between the support and metal. The major research points of these catalysts concentrate on adjusting the atomic constitution or structure of the support and regulating the catalytic performance by introducing an additive.5 However, there still exists some uncertainties in the research with respect to the activity mechanism of supported catalysts. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to improving the design route and further exploring the reaction mechanisms of catalysts. For example, Otroshchenko et al. proposed the reaction mechanism based on introducing structural defects as active centers, which provides an innovative approach to better understand the reaction pathway.19 In the following aspects, we mainly discuss the progress of different types of catalysts along with the relevant reaction mechanism in propane catalytic dehydrogenation.
3.1 Pt-based catalysts
Pt-based catalysts have already been commercialized in propane dehydrogenation processes. The metallic Pt species in Pt-based catalysts serve as a vital constituent for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane, and exhibit a strong tendency to activate the C–H bond.27 Although Pt-based catalysts possess the advantages of environmental friendliness, robust activity and excellent stability, intrinsic drawbacks such as high cost and sintering agglomeration also bring significant challenges. Various strategies have been developed to restrain coking reaction and alleviate the sintering of active species to date. For instance, the side reactions ((1)–(4)) could be effectively prevented by decreasing the loading and particle size of Pt or introducing another additive.8 In addition, the properties of the support have a significant impact on the dispersion, electronic structure and reducibility of Pt, which further influence the performance of Pt-based catalysts in dehydrogenation reaction.28 Thus, the following sections focus on the progress and possible active sites of Pt-based catalysts with the modification of the additive and support.

3.1.1 Catalyst supports for Pt-based catalysts It is widely known that the inherent properties of thermal stability, acid–base nature and surface area of the support play a crucial role in catalyzing propane dehydrogenation reaction. In particular, it is necessary for PDH catalysts to possess exceptional thermal stability because the reaction–regeneration process always proceeds under 500 °C or even harsh conditions. The active species of Pt-based catalysts are generally anchored or dispersed on the support, which makes the performance strongly dependent on the synergistic interaction between the support and active components.29 In the ideal Pt-based catalysts, the Pt loading is required to reach a threshold value (0.1 wt%–1 wt%) so as to achieve realistic applications.10 Thus, it is expected to obtain high utilization and maximum exposed active Pt in Pt-based catalysts with low Pt content to realize improved catalytic activity.8 Several kinds of materials (Al2O3, CeO2, ZrO2, Ga2O3, SiO2, MgAl2O4/ZnAl2O4, zeolite, and carbon materials) have been utilized as supports in heterogeneous catalysis of alkane dehydrogenation.30–38 The categories of supports are simply classified as oxides and other materials. 3.1.1.1 Oxide supports Al2O3 supports, being promising, have received considerable attention due to their large surface area, adequate mechanical properties, high thermal conductivity/stability, outstanding plasticity, and SMSI for application in PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. However, Al2O3 supports usually suffer from adverse side reactions owing to their intrinsic acidic sites, resulting in inferior performance and rapid degradation. Researchers have demonstrated that the rational regulation of supports could thoroughly improve the stability of catalysts. For example, Zn/Mg-doped Al2O3 produced a stable spinel phase with high stability, indicating that the introduced alkali metal in Al2O3 poisoned the acidic sites and relieved the coke depositing behavior.34,39–42 Similarly, a relatively high anti-shifting capacity in the reaction–regeneration process can be achieved at elevated temperature by strengthening the metal–support interactions in catalysts. Zhu and co-workers developed an Al2O3 support with high content of Al3+penta sites, in which an unsaturated penta-coordinated Al3+ site acted as a trap to effectively capture Pt–Sn2 clusters by the formation of Al–O–Pt bonds.43 The authors also revealed that the Al3+penta site enables the support to effectively stabilize metal species, avoiding the sintering agglomeration behavior during the PDH reaction–regeneration process. Owing to the favorable structure–stability–recyclability relationship, the Pt–Sn2/meso-Al2O3 exhibited an outstanding performance with an equilibrium conversion of 40% and the corresponding selectivity around 98%. In addition, Bao et al. reported that the Al3+penta site served as a bonding site to catch Pt and Ga ions through an oxygen bridge bond.44 Benefiting from the SMSI effect, it promoted the distribution of metallic species and protected active species from agglomeration during the reaction process. Therefore, the Al2O3 supports with the modification of their ideal coordinated structure contributed towards the improvement of the performance of catalysts. Zhang et al. prepared PtSn nanoparticles loaded on mesoporous Al2O3, possessing high dispersion and abundant structural properties.45 Benefiting from the strong anchoring of active components by the support, the resulting catalyst displayed enhanced catalytic stability and reaction selectivity.
Furthermore, support materials with diverse surface properties have been investigated to develop catalysts in catalytic PDH reaction. It is found that the CeO2 support could interact with a Pt atom under high temperature reaction conditions inducing an SMSI effect.46 Besides, the additional metallic Sn serves as a dispersant to form stable and highly dispersed PtSn nanoclusters, providing excellent propene selectivity and robust stability. Perechodjuk and co-workers synthesized ZrO2 supported variable metallic nanoparticles and studied the selectivity and activity in catalyzing the PDH process.37 Chang et al. carried out a microscopic dynamic analysis of a single atom doped Ga2O3 catalyst, achieving an important breakthrough with volcano-like plots, which can be attributed to the interaction originating from Lewis acid–base effects.38 Deng and colleagues synthesized a precursor material through a wet impregnation method and then modified it with Pt nanoparticles, which acted as the major active center by a direct H2 reduction pathway.47 The authors claimed that the superior performance with a conversion of 21.3% and a selectivity of 94.4% is mainly attributed to the SMSI effect between the support and active center. Recently, zeolites have been used as supports due to their advantages of specific pore channels, suitable pore size and distinct morphology, significantly affecting the properties and catalytic performance of catalysts. A series of Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 samples were prepared by confining Pt and Sn nanoclusters into a ZSM-5 zeolite with different Si/Al atom molar ratios.48 The zeolite supported metal-based catalysts displayed exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, a pure siliceous material is constrained by inferior metal–support interactions, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance. Therefore, Corma and coworkers opened up an avenue to address the issue through confining bimetal PtSn sub-nanoclusters (0.5–0.6 nm) in channel walls or cavity holes.49 The results further revealed that the catalysts showed excellent stability and effectively enabled metal migration and sintering agglomeration, thus improving the long-term stability in the PDH process.
3.1.1.2 Other supports In the last decade, carbon nanomaterials have been extensively investigated in the catalysis field due to their low cost, well-defined structure, and easily regulated surface properties. Sun and co-workers investigated nitrogen-doped graphene supported single-atom Pt catalyzing the PDH reaction by using density functional theory (DFT).50 Theoretical results revealed that the nitrogen-doped graphene positively regulated the electronic state of Pt and made the d band of the Pt atom reach close to the Fermi level, which is favorable for the desorption of the product and better reaction activity. Liu et al. developed a hybrid nanocarbon catalyst with a nanodiamond core and a defective slim graphene shell supported Pt nanoparticle, demonstrating the strengthening of the metal–support interaction induced by the donated electrons from the defective graphene shell to Pt nanoparticles.51 The authors proposed that the SMSI and fast propene desorption not only significantly improved the anti-transferring ability, but also greatly increased propylene selectivity. Recently, Mxenes, typical 2D transition metal carbides with well-defined surface and structural properties, exhibited a pivotal role as supports in heterogeneous catalysis reaction. Li et al. designed an effective Mxene supported Pt catalyst to catalyze the dehydrogenation of alkanes, which provides extremely high selectivity to activate the C–H bond due to the SMSI effect with respect to the formation of a Pt3Ti ordered intermetallic compound.52 Moreover, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is widely used as a support in a variety of catalytic reactions owing to its thermal conductivity, thermal stability, acid and alkali resistance and unsaturated coordination structure. Wang et al. synthesized the Pt/BN catalyst via an impregnation method, showing a promoted anti-coking ability and propene selectivity owing to the low acidity of the BN support and SMSI effect.53
In summary, most of the supports play a unique role in catalytic reactions due to their distinctive properties, which greatly influences the performance of catalysts. Therefore, the enhanced activity, selectivity and stability of supported catalysts could be achieved through optimizing the interaction between the supports and active components.
3.1.2 Catalyst additives for Pt-based catalysts Additives play an important role in regulating the activity, selectivity and stability of noble metal-based catalysts. It is noteworthy that the introduction of additives is capable of significantly modifying the intrinsic activity of supported Pt-based catalysts. Taking the bimetallic Pt–Sn catalyst as an example, Sn additives favor the enhancement of the anti-coking ability and improve coking-resistance during the PDH process as well as prolonging the lifespan of the catalyst. The reason for the improved performance with the Sn additive is ascribed to the following factors: (1) geometric effect. The Sn constituent serves as a space separator, which is favorable for increasing the dispersity of the Pt active species together with suitable particle sizes. (2) Metal–support interactions. The existing metallic Sn is capable of increasing the mobility of the adsorbed H2 or poisoning the acidic sites of the support. (3) Electron effect. The formation of PtSn alloys is beneficial in lowering the d-band of Pt to further promote propylene desorption.54,55 In order to elucidate the spatial isolation effects of Sn on Pt species, Beale et al. proposed that Pt nanoparticles with the regulation of Sn exhibited more uniform distribution (Fig. 4), which revealed the improved Pt dispersity induced by the geometric effect.56 The SMSI effect between Pt and SnO2 on the structural features and catalytic activity of the catalyst under targeted reaction conditions has been systematically studied.57 The results indicated that the geometric effect contributed greatly to the dehydrogenation activity than the electronic effect. Sattler and coworkers evaluated the interaction between metallic Pt and Sn together with catalytic properties according to the related reaction activity characterization.58 It demonstrated that bimetallic Pt–Sn sub-nanoclusters could achieve better catalytic performance when used with an increased pre-reduced time in H2. The improvement of bimetallic Pt–Sn interactions can be attributed to the regulated adsorption of light hydrocarbon and intermediates, thus further preventing the formation of by-products and coke. It is generally acknowledged that the bulk Pt3Sn component is considered as essential activity center in catalyzing PDH reaction. DFT calculations revealed that the deficient step sites in Pt3Sn constituents endowed the catalyst with exceptional performance including high propylene selectivity together with low coking content.59 Hook et al. claimed that the electron effect was the dominant factor in Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts with low Sn loading, while the geometric effect played a critical role when there was high Sn loading.60 In brief, Sn is deemed as an excellent additive when used in supported bimetallic Pt–Sn catalysts with thoroughly improved catalytic activity, stability, and strong anti-coking ability.35,61–63

Besides the metallic Sn, other metallic additives were also reported to promote the selectivity and activity of Pt-based catalysts in the PDH process. Cai et al. designed a catalyst with a Pt surface and abundant transition metals under the surface.64 Therefore, the Pt-skin catalyst with a well-defined structure exhibited inconsistent propene selectivity (Pt < PtNi@Pt < PtCo@Pt < PtFe@Pt) owing to the modified electron effect triggered by different transition metals. The optimized d-band center of the Pt atom significantly improves the catalytic performance with the introduction of another transition metal, which opens a new direction for subsurface catalysis in the PDH reaction. Xiao et al. evaluated the catalytic activity and selectivity of a series of Pt-based alloy catalysts in the PDH reaction by combining micro-kinetic analysis and DFT calculations.11 The results showed that the post-transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Ru, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, and Au) modified Pt core greatly changed the electronic structure of Pt atoms on the surface through a stress effect and charge transfer, making the Co@Pt core–shell catalyst a promising candidate material with both exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity. Moreover, Li et al. synthesized a Pt–Zn/Si-beta catalyst via two post-treatment steps with the assistance of bonding interactions between Si-OH sites and Zn ions.65 The Zn anchoring site could strongly constrain the Pt during the post-synthesis owing to the enhanced electron interaction. Thus, the Zn species played an important role in the electron modification of the Pt species, which acts as an anchor site in the chemical bonding of Pt compositions. Fan and coworkers reported that the introduction of metallic Mn could regulate the dispersity of the Pt species and the alloying content of PtxMny alloys, obviously boosting the stability of the catalyst.66 Specifically, the improved dispersion of Pt components is related to the abundant MnOx in the support, which is attributed to the SMSI and active sites of PtMn alloy nanoparticles.
Besides metallic dopants, heteroatoms also play a critical role in regulating the performance of catalysts. Lu's group revealed that sulfur impurity in Al2O3 supported Pt catalysts contributed to the modulation of the electronic state of Pt nanoparticles and poisoning of the unsaturated Pt centers.67 In this regard, the catalysts with adjustable sulfur content were favorable for the excellent C3H6 desorption and anti-coking ability. It was worth noting that doping with other heteroatoms (such as B, N, and P) also has been confirmed to enhance coking resistance, achieving the high stability and long lifespan of catalysts. This study paves a new way to introduce nonmetallic impurity into catalysts to promote the catalytic performance.
The effect of different metal elements on the PDH activity for the Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst was investigated, further revealing the Pt–Cu/Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst showed optimized propylene yields and recyclable regeneration properties.33 This enhancement of performance originated from the formation of intermetallic alloys and slight phase separation during the dehydrogenation–regeneration process. Qi and coworkers determined the stable coordination of single Pt atoms in a dealuminated BEA zeolite with rich Zn terminal sites (Fig. 5).68 The optimized catalyst showed higher activity and extreme propene selectivity in long-term operation. The results further revealed that the coordination number of the Zn atom around Pt ranged from 4 to 6. In addition, it was confirmed that the catalyst with abundant (Si–O–Zn)4–6Pt active species played a significant role in catalyzing the dehydrogenation reaction. The performance of 0.04Pt–0.36Zn–DeAlBEA surpassed those of the majority of PtZn alloys and previously reported nanoclusters (Fig. 5p and Table 1), demonstrating a nearly 100% selectivity and robust stability. It also exhibited long-time stability, operating in the presence of a tiny amount of H2. There was no drastic deactivation behavior obviously observed during the reaction time of 160 h, originating from the coordination anchoring effect between the evenly distributed Zn atoms and single Pt atoms.

Generally, the supported pure Pt catalyst shows inferior performance and rapid inactivation under industrial operation conditions. As for regulating the catalytic activity of PDH, various additives have been introduced to improve the dispersity and structural and electron properties of Pt (Table 1). With the help of additives, it was concluded that the properties of the support could be greatly modified. The resulting alloys, intermetallic compounds and nanoclusters act as active components to further promote the olefin selectivity and long-term stability with improved coking-resistance. Moreover, it was suggested that the advanced catalysts with high atomic utilization and long-term stability are essential for the industrial application of PDH.68,69 Meanwhile, the cost of Pt-based catalysts could be much lower in the near future. Owing to maximum atom-utilization efficiency, Pt single-atom catalysts enable the reasonable use of Pt resources and exhibit great potential in the PDH process. Future efforts should be devoted to the optimization of synthetic routes and atomic coordination environments coupled with geometric confinement.
3.2 CrOx-based catalysts
Supported CrOx-based catalysts are widely used in Catofin and FBD-4 processes to produce high-valued propylene ingredients owing to their low cost and high catalytic performance.8,80 In comparison with Pt-based catalysts, CrOx-based catalysts possess well-defined and easily regulated active components in favorable catalytic processes. However, supported CrOx-based catalysts also involve more complicated compositions such as various valences of chromium ions such as Cr6+Ox, Cr5+Ox, Cr3+Ox, Cr2+Ox, CrOx oligomers, and crystallized Cr2O3, which makes it difficult to investigate the origin of high performance.28,81 Despite the controversy, it is acknowledged that Cr3+Ox can be used as active species in supported CrOx-based catalysts for catalyzing the PDH reaction.28,82 In addition, CrOx-based catalysts also have many inherent drawbacks such as rapid inactivation and the required frequent regeneration caused by irreversible structure modification.8 With the purpose of modifying the performance of CrOx-based catalysts, a number of strategies has been developed based on the regulation of the support, the introduction of additives, and the modification of the active Cr species.
3.2.1 Catalyst supports for CrOx-based catalysts It is generally known that the acidity of the support enormously affects the performance of CrOx-based catalysts. In 2019, Gao and colleagues developed rod-type porous Al2O3 with various acidity levels to load the Cr2O3 species.83 Compared with the CrOx-based catalysts using commercial Al2O3, the as-synthesized Cr/Al2O3 catalyst showed a better stability and coke resistance, which should be assigned to the low acidity in porous Al2O3. Hu et al. used H2 pre-reduction to enhance the interaction between the Cr species and Al2O3 supports, for improving the stability and anti-coking properties of the catalyst in the PDH reaction.84 The structural properties of Al2O3 also exert an influence on the performance of a supported CrOx catalyst. Lang et al. found that the mesoporous Al2O3 supported highly distributed Cr components showed enhanced activity and stability in catalytic PDH.85 Although it is extensively utilized as a commercial catalyst, there are still many challenges for Al2O3-supported CrOx in industrial applications. For instance, the formation of a stable spinel crystal phase gives rise to the unrecoverable loss of the active Cr3+ constituent, which is ascribed to the shift of Cr3+ to the lattice of Al2O3 during high-temperature reaction.86
Hence, the exploration of chemically stable supports for catalyzing PDH reactions has received extensive attention. He and colleagues employed an MCM-41 support with different loadings of Cr to explore its influence on the PDH process.87 The obtained catalysts revealed high loading of Cr bringing about the reduction of SiO2 surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of the inactive Cr(iii) species. Meanwhile, the absence of the isolated state of the Cr(vi) species in this sample contributed to high activity toward the PDH process. Wegrzyniak and coworkers developed a CMK-3 carbon-based support by utilizing SBA-15 as a sacrificial agent and sucrose as the carbon resource.88 It was found that CMK-3 supported with 20 wt% Cr showed the optimum propane conversion. However, the application of a carbon-based catalyst is severely limited by the restricted lifetime due to coke deposition and the recycling challenge at high temperature. Hu et al. synthesized a 5%Cr/Z-5(260) (SiO2/Al2O3 = 260) catalyst by using the wet impregnation method, which exhibited an initial propene formation rate of 4.1 mmol gcat−1 h−1 under a weight hourly space velocity of 0.59 h−1.89 During the consecutive 50 h reaction time, the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst presented a remarkable performance with a propane conversion of 32.6% as well as a propylene selectivity of 94.2% (Fig. 6a).89 The results suggested that Na-doping could regulate the interaction between Brønsted sites and Cr components, thus decreasing the adsorption of propane and inhibiting the activation of C–H bonds (Fig. 6b and c). However, Na-doping poisoned the Brønsted sites resulting in an inferior C3H6 rate, which further revealed the profound effect of Brønsted sites on the formation of C3H6 (Fig. 6d). Meanwhile, the HZSM-5 zeolite with a well-defined structure and relatively large surface area provided an adequate space for dispersed Cr species. Thanks to the synergistic effect between the Cr species and support, the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst presented an enhanced activity and stability.89

In practice, numerous supporting materials have been investigated and evaluated in an initial laboratory test for CrOx-based catalysts in PDH reactions, but the challenges (such as side reactions) still hinder their large-scale industrial application. It is highly desirable to develop advanced techniques and facile approaches for regulating the properties of supports and the interaction between the support and active components.
3.2.2 Catalyst additives for CrOx-based catalysts The introduction of additives could fundamentally improve the overall properties of CrOx-based catalysts including the surface properties and structural morphology, thus promoting the PDH process with enhanced activity and selectivity together with stability. Zhang and co-workers reported a Ce-modified Cr/Al2O3 catalyst with outstanding activity, which demonstrated that the enhanced stability was attributed to the decreased content of isolated inactive Cr(vi) in the Ce-doped Cr/Al2O3 catalyst.90 They further indicated that the increased amounts of oxygen vacancy could bring about strong interactions between Ce and Cr. In the research by Han et al., the characterization and DFT calculation results revealed the unsaturated coordination of adjacent Zr sites acting as the dominant active component in Cr20Zr80/SiO2 with low loading contents of CrZrOx constituents.91 Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that the SMSI between CrOx and SiO2 robustly improved the stability. Shao and colleagues synthesized a porous structure of an Al2O3 framework by using in situ Sn doping.92 The abundant surface properties of the Al2O3 support with uniform Sn-related components benefited the formation of polymeric Cr active species, thus contributing to the promoted activity as well as stability. Li et al. prepared a Ni-regulating Cr/Al catalyst with apparently enhanced performance, which revealed the outstanding activity owing to the interaction between Ni and Cr components.93 Meanwhile, benefiting from the favorable interaction, a low polymeric Cr species was generated and regulated the valence state of Cr-related constituents. Liu and co-workers synthesized a catalyst by changing the addition order of K+ to the precursor.94 It was noted that the addition of K+ before loading Cr onto Al2O3 reduced the acidity of the catalyst and formed single low polymeric Cr components, increasing the coking-resistance properties. Furthermore, other alkali metal elements such as Na, Li, Mg, Ga and Cs are also utilized as additives to elevate the catalytic performance in light alkane dehydrogenation activity.95
Thus, the modification of suitable supports and additives endowed Cr-based catalysts with an enhanced PDH performance. In order to summarize the catalytic performance, some Cr-based catalysts with improved dispersion and structural and electronic properties are summarized in Table 2. However, their industrial application is still restrained by the detrimental effects on the environment and organisms. In addition, due to the high temperature reaction conditions, the inevitable formation of molten CrO3 constituents brought an enormous challenge to the design of reactors. Moreover, although the introduced metal could moderately modify the electronic structure of Cr species, it also causes inverse conversion under consecutive reaction–recycling processes. The uncontrollable variation of the charge state in Cr species can not be easily settled under drastically high temperatures. Thus, further exploration of more other metal-based catalysts is a reasonable strategy to solve the problem.

3.3 Other catalysts
Although Pt-based/Cr-based catalysts have been used as commercial catalysts, the rare resources of Pt are of high-cost and the harmful Cr species are unfavorable to the ecological environment, respectively. There is an urgent requirement to develop low-cost, environmentally biocompatible, and highly efficient catalysts as an alternative to Pt/Cr-based catalysts. Hence, it is of great significance in the investigation of other metal- and metal-free based catalysts for catalyzing the PDH process.
3.3.1 V-based catalysts Metallic vanadium-based catalysts have been deemed as promising candidates in the PDH process with relatively low-cost and slight toxicity. Sokolov and co-workers exploited a supported VOx-based catalyst material with exceptional activity and robust stability during long term reaction–regeneration evaluations.97 The results further revealed that the large VOx nanoparticles and highly polymeric VOx species easily led to coke deposition and the corresponding rapid deactivation. Zhao et al. realized the considerable relationship between the content of V-OH and catalytic stability, demonstrating that the V-OH species help resist the coking reaction and further improve the stability of the catalyst,98 whereas, the excessive hydroxyl group may block the exposed V3+ active sites on the surface of catalysts, resulting in unfavorable activity. The corresponding V components in a fresh VOx-based catalyst presented different forms such as V5+, V4+, V3+, monovanadate, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5. Meanwhile, the loading content of V greatly affects the valence state and polymerization degree, in which the active sites can include the polymeric V3+ and V4+ as well as isolated VOx species (monovanadate).27,99 Therefore, appropriate regulation of V in VOx-based catalysts has a great influence on the charge states and valence states, which further produces a significant effect in catalyzing PDH performance.
Al2O3 is a typical support material for heterogeneous catalysis, in which the intrinsic acidic site presents dual characteristics. Generally speaking, the acidic sites are favorable for the formation of active V related components, promoting the conversion of alkane. Besides, excessive acidic sites would induce a parasitic reaction, resulting in an inferior olefin selectivity together with rapid inactivation behavior.99,100 Sokolov et al. designed a series of supports with different acidity levels to support single layer VOx components for catalyzing the PDH reaction.101 The results confirmed that the tendency to form coke increased with the surface acidity of the catalyst. Shan and colleagues explored catalysts with similar surface densities of V species on variable Al2O3 crystals.102 The contents of surface –OH on Al2O3 was proven to affect the polymeric degree of VOx species and the interaction between VOx and the Al2O3 support. Hu et al. synthesized a microporous VOx-SiO2 catalyst with exceptional catalytic performance revealing that the low polymeric VOx species is considered as the major active center during the PDH catalysis.103 Wu et al. prepared a virus-like structure of a porous SiO2 nanosphere supported VOx catalyst by the sol–gel method.104 It is found that adequate VOx loading content and high dispersion degree of the VOx species of the resulting catalyst are critical to achieving excellent catalytic performance in PDH. Xie and colleagues synthesized a catalyst by loading VOx on ZrO2, demonstrating that the SMSI between VOx and ZrO2 is beneficial for the formation of low coordinated V species with respect to the favorable C–H activation.105 Recently, catalysts with different V loading contents were prepared with the dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite.106 Low vanadium contents of catalysts exhibited single or separated VOx components, while high contents showed core-rich VOx constituents with various polymeric degrees. Benefitting from the strong interaction between VOx and the support, the content of acidic sites was closely related to the corresponding activity, verifying that the bonded VOx species greatly enhanced the activity and stability in the presence of V–O–Si formation. In order to promote the stability of catalysts, Gu et al. used PH3 to modify the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst with P doping, achieving improved catalytic properties including optimized surface acidity, separation of polymeric VOx components, and SMSI.107 Finally, the synergistic effect drastically promoted the desorption of propylene and inhibited the side reaction of coke intermediates (Fig. 7). Wu and colleagues also synthesized a Mg-modified VOx/Al2O3 catalyst.108 Their results indicated that well-dispersed 2D V2O5 nanoparticles can be formed with the introduction of suitable Mg, thus elevating the coke resistance ability and long-term stability.

In conclusion, extensive research efforts have been devoted to improving the activity of supported VOx-based catalysts in catalyzing the PDH reaction, while the coke formation and rapid deactivation remain a great challenge. Furthermore, the catalytic performances of recent V-based catalysts for PDH are summarized in Table 3. More attention should be focused on the design of supports with functional properties, which determines the acidic strength and the reinforced SMSI. Therefore, the investigation of the anti-coking ability and deactivation behavior should be considered a developing trend and given study emphasis.

3.3.2 Sn-based catalysts Metallic Sn is widely used to regulate the geometric characteristics and electronic properties of Pt. Specifically, the addition of Sn constrained the side reaction through isolating the surface agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles. Moreover, the electron migration from Sn to Pt promoted the adsorption of propylene and further improved the activity and stability for the PDH process.99 Noteworthily, Sn with a suitable support could display a comparable performance in contrast to the commercial Pt–Sn-based catalysts. Owing to the liquid state of metallic Sn in high temperature reactions, the adsorption time of the reactant on the active components can be prolonged, resulting in enhanced selectivity.6 However, metallic Sn active species suffered from serious loss due to the liquefaction state under high reaction temperature, which severely restricted their performance in the PDH reaction process. Wang et al. have reported a low-cost and environmentally friendly Sn/SiO2 catalyst to replace the commercial Pt/Cr2O3-based catalyst, in which metallic Sn serves as a significant active component.109 Wang and co-workers proposed that the hexagonal mesoporous SiO2 with a low content of Sn contributed to the relatively high conversion (40%) and outstanding stability.110 Meanwhile, the possible reason for the excellent stability was attributed to the SMSI together with a confinement effect by the utilization of a mesoporous structure. Another SnO2/SiO2 catalyst with low loading of Sn and tetra-coordinated Sn species also presented high activity and outstanding stability owing to the SMSI.111 Furthermore, through regulating the molar ratio of Na+ salt and CTAB, a dendritic-type Sn-doped mesoporous SiO2 catalyst was synthesized with the particle size ranging from 170 to 360 nm.112 Its characterization further revealed that the highly dispersed SnOx species favored the activation of propane and the formation of propylene. Besides, it was suggested that appropriate Na-doping was capable of reducing the acidity of the catalyst corresponding to the improved propene selectivity.
Yue and co-workers found that the BEA zeolite support with the introduction of Sn contained a certain number of acidic sites, which effectively activated the C–H bond and promoted the catalytic activity for PDH (Fig. 8).113 Moreover, the influence on the content ratio of the Lewis acid to Brønsted acid for PDH reaction was thoroughly discussed. The results verified that the introduction of Na reasonably regulated the ratio of the Lewis acid to Brønsted acid, achieving an optimized activity with a propane conversion of ∼40% and a propene selectivity of ∼92%. Wang et al. evaluated the intrinsic activity of a SnO2/SiO2 catalyst and indicated that the polymeric Si–O–Sn2+ constituents were deemed as the major active species.114 Meanwhile, the formed Ni3Sn2 alloy acted as a promoter after being reduced under a H2 atmosphere, which is beneficial for the regeneration of active sites and the desorption of H2.

Owing to their considerable merits mentioned above, the Sn-based catalysts have been used as a candidate to replace commercial Pt-based catalysts. However, it is still a challenge that the migration and loss of active sites, resulting from the liquefaction of the Sn metal under high temperature reaction conditions. Therefore, further long-term investigation needs to be performed on the Sn-based catalysts in order to realize their industrial application.
3.3.3 Zn-Based catalysts In recent years, numerous investigations have focused on exploring the activity in catalyzing the PDH process by employing a Zn-based catalyst. The relationship between the catalytic performance and structural properties was evaluated for catalyzing the PDH process based on Al2O3 supported Zn-based catalysts.115 The authors found that the exposed active Zn species on the surface of ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts quickly deactivated during the reaction–regeneration process, while the spinel type of ZnxAlyO4 catalyst with a stabilized structure could almost recover the entire activity after being carbonized in air. Chen et al. investigated the performance of HZSM-5 zeolite supported Zn with various contents.116 The resulting 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 exhibited an exceptional performance with better activity and stability in catalyzing the PDH reaction, revealing that the HZSM-5 support bonded with tiny ZnO nanoclusters as the major active center. Liu et al. clearly defined the ZnO active constituents as main contributors to the exceptional dispersity and stability in the silicalite-1 supported ZnO catalyst.117 The catalyst with 5 wt% Zn presented the best propane conversion reaching 49% and high propene selectivity around 90% under a space velocity of 5000 ml g−1 h−1. Zhao et al. synthesized a catalyst with ZnOx active components by using the composites of commercial ZnO and a support, suggesting that the defective –OH species played a pivotal role on the formation of ZnOx components. Meanwhile, in contrast to the commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst under the same reaction conditions, the ZnO-silicate-1 catalyst showed better stability during the consecutive catalysis of 400 h and exhibited promising application prospects (Fig. 9).20 Han et al. prepared a series of supported active ZnOx constituents to catalyze the PDH reaction.118 Benefiting from the isolated Zn2+Ox active species, the Zn(4 wt%)/TiZrOx catalyst showed excellent activity and stability. Noteworthily, the inherent activity of a single Zn2+Ox species can be elevated by utilizing a TiO2 promoter. Qu and colleagues developed a Ti-doped ZnAl2O4 catalyst by using the heterogeneous co-precipitation method and employed it to catalyze the PDH reaction.119 The authors claimed that the introduction of Ti-related constituents could promote the desorption of coordination unsaturated active Zn sites (Zncus) and the migration of lattice oxygen, thus greatly improving the propene selectivity and catalyst stability. The experiment results also showed the Zn1.5Ti1Al2 catalyst with abundant Zncus sites showing optimized performance with a propane conversion of ∼43%, and a propene selectivity around ∼84%, respectively.

The current improvement strategy of Zn-based catalysts has been concentrated on restricting coke deposition and suppressing the reduction of active ZnOx species. The activity and stability of the supported Zn-based catalysts could be enhanced by choosing a suitable support and introducing adequate promoters. Besides, further research should focus on the retention of activity and stability during long-term reaction–regeneration tests.
3.3.4 Ga-Based catalysts In previous reports, Ga was used as an additive in the synthesis of a Pt–Ga-based catalyst, and then successfully used in the Dow FCDh process. Recently, Ga-based catalysts have also been utilized as potential candidates to substitute the existing commercial catalysts. For example, the performance of a Ga2O3 catalyst with various crystalline structures was evaluated for the PDH process.120 The β-Ga2O3 catalyst with rich medium strong acidic sites exhibited excellent catalytic performance, which is ascribed to the unsaturated coordination of Ga3+ sites serving as the active center. Cartro-Fernández et al. explored the relationship between the surface acidity of different crystalline structures and the corresponding PDH activity, revealing that the β-Ga2O3/SiO2 catalyst exhibited an optimal performance compared with the α-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3 catalysts, due to the large number of weakly Lewis acidic sites from β-Ga2O3 (Fig. 10).21 Moreover, the authors verified that the decreased propene selectivity of γ-Ga2O3 on the silica support was due to the introduction of abundant weak Brønsted acids. The DFT calculation results validated that the dehydroxylated oxygen-deficient model β-Ga2O3 surface containing tetra- and penta-coordinated Ga Lewis acidic sites possessed a stronger binding affinity in comparison with the tri-coordinated Ga3+ sites. Further characterization further confirmed that the tetra- and penta-coordinated Ga3+ sites with a stronger Lewis acid favored the generation of coke. Hence, the authors claimed that the β-Ga2O3 catalyst with weakly Lewis acidic sites and tri-coordinated Ga3+ sites to be the optimized catalyst with an ideal structure for catalyzing the PDH process. Kim et al. prepared a Ga-doped MFI zeolite catalyst with diverse morphologies and hierarchical structures.121 The hierarchical porous Ga-MFI catalyst, possessing a Brønsted site and a Lewis site adjacent to the mesopore, showed intrinsically higher activity and selectivity comparable to the bulk Ga-MFI catalyst. In addition, Schreiber et al. proposed an interaction mechanism with regard to Lewis–Brønsted acids, demonstrating that they were beneficial for the formation of [GaH]2+ when the Brønsted acid was close to Ga3+.122 Meanwhile, with the assistance of DFT calculations, the high activity involving a bifunctional mechanism promoted the heterolytic activation of C–H bonds accompanied by a monomolecular elimination of H2 and desorption of propene. Shao et al. synthesized numerous diverse catalysts including ZSM-5, SBA-15, Al2O3, and SiO2 with different loading contents of Ga, indicating that the 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst presented high catalytic activity and robust stability owing to the uniformly distributed Ga species and active Gaδ+ (δ < 2) sites.123 Chang et al. carried out a microkinetic analysis to evaluate the adsorption and catalytic behavior on the single-atom-doped Ga2O3 catalyst, revealing that the regulation of Lewis acid–alkali interactions could break through volcano-like plots.38 Moreover, further experiments found that the performance of theoretically predicted Ir1-Ga2O3 surpassed that of the previously reported trace-Pt-promoted Ga2O3 catalyst.

In practical application, the Ga-based catalysts are restrained by the sintering agglomeration of active GaOx components, resulting in rapid deactivation caused by the coking reaction. Furthermore, Ga-based catalysts present a relatively low selectivity of olefins and difficult reactant desorption due to the strong adsorption of inherent acidic sites. The further design of desirable Ga-based catalysts should be primarily focused on the improvement of stability and selectivity.
3.3.5 Zr-Based catalysts Bulk ZrO2 catalysts display greater advantages in various aspects, especially their environmental friendliness and cost effectiveness. Moreover, unsaturated coordinated metal cations with an adjacent oxygen vacancy are deemed as the adsorption sites of the alkane, in which the surface oxygen site could extract the H atom from the adsorbed alkane.27 Thus, Otroshchenko et al. proposed that a ZrO2 catalyst with the introduction of Y2O3 could produce a large quantity of structural defects, promoting the formation of unsaturated coordinated Zr (Zrcus) active sites.124 Meanwhile, the authors found that the redox properties of ZrO2 can be greatly improved with the addition of Ru nanoparticles. Furthermore, the resulting catalyst contributed to the formation of Zrcus active species, revealing that the Zrcus sites together with the adjacent lattice oxygen promoted the production of propene. In addition, the relationship among redox properties, acid–alkali characteristics and structural morphologies was also discussed for PDH activity, indicating that the low content of surface unsaturated coordinated Zrcus sites were the active sites in catalyzing the PDH process.125 Zhang et al. further investigated the relationship among the crystal size, phase structure and PDH performance, revealing that ZrO2 with the lattice oxygen spilling would produce coordination unsaturated Zr active sites under reduction treatment.126 Meanwhile, the content of Zrcus greatly affected the PDH performance (Fig. 11). Besides, the content of Zrcus was regulated by the introduction of a metal oxide, verifying that the active metal with exceptional affinity to hydrogen benefited the catalysis of the PDH process.19 It is noteworthy that the Zrcus active species with moderate trace metal elements exhibited the optimized catalytic performance owing to the regulated reduction degree,127 while the excessive reduction degree led to a strong adsorption with the difficult desorption of the reaction intermediate, resulting in fast deactivation caused by the induced coking reaction. In brief, several issues still need to be addressed regarding the coke deposition during the reaction–regeneration process to avoid the inactivation of the catalyst.

3.3.6 Other non-noble metal-based catalysts Sarazen and coworkers pyrolyzed a Fe-MOF precursor to obtain a carbon-supported Fe-based catalyst and applied it in the PDH catalysis. The metallic Fe0 played a significant role in the formation of propylene and further affected the activity and selectivity (Fig. 12a).128 Hu et al. synthesized a series of SiO2 supported various iron species (isolated atom Fe(ii), FexOy, and Fe0) in catalyzing the PDH reaction, validating that the catalyst with a single atom Fe(ii) active center showed the highest activity and excellent selectivity (∼99%).129 In another study, the molar ratios of Fe to P were regulated to develop an optimized Fe/P/Al2O3(Fe/P = 3) catalyst in catalyzing the PDH reaction, demonstrating that the great performance with respect to propane conversion and propylene selectivity was attributed to the formation of the Fe3C species by the introduction of P. Wang et al. performed DFT calculations to show that the Fe3C with surrounding Fe components exhibited an inferior performance comparable to the Fe3C adjacent to the carbon-rich structure.130 This indicated that the carbon played a key role in regulating the electronic properties of Fe, thus improving the performance of the catalyst used in the PDH process. In addition, the authors claimed that the P-modified catalyst more easily generated coke owing to the negative effect of P doping, which further validated that coke could not have existed on the surface of the catalyst due to the acceptor effect of P-doping.

Recently, Cao and coworkers developed a stabilized oxygen carbon nanotube (OCNT) with atomically distributed Co–N species, showing a relatively high initial propane conversion of ∼20% and an exceptional propylene selectivity exceeding 95%.131 The experimental results and dynamic analysis verified the favorable catalytic activity assigned to the active Co–N components with an OCNT shell. Dewangan et al. reported various Al2O3 with diverse morphologies supported Co-based catalysts, uncovering the catalytic mechanism with regard to the SMSI and Lewis acidic sites (Fig. 12b and c).132 The authors indicated that the increased strongly Lewis acidic sites and oxygen vacancies would enhance the SMSI corresponding to the promoted catalytic stability, while the tetra-coordination of the Co2+ site was considered as the major active center in catalyzing the PDH reaction.
Saelee et al. performed DFT calculations to study the lattice plane of Ni(111) in catalyzing the PDH process, confirming that Ni(111) contributed to the outstanding dehydrogenation activity, while the strong adsorption of propylene resulted in low selectivity.133 Zhang et al. introduced P resources to modify the Ni site of the Ni/SiO2 catalyst and finally applied it in the PDH process, revealing that Ni(ii)–OSi was the major active site to activate the C–H bond (Fig. 12d and e).134 Meanwhile, the formed Ni(ii)-OP effectively prevented the reduction of Ni(ii) to Ni0, the loss of active sites, and the degradation of activity and selectivity.
Li et al. proposed a defective TiO2-based catalyst and combined DFT calculations to evaluate the PDH reaction process of the catalyst, demonstrating that the major active center was assigned to the oxygen vacancy adjacent to the tetra-coordination Ticus4+ site.136 Shang et al. explored the effects of oxygen vacancy content with the remarkably enhanced close to quadra-coordination Ticus4+ by means of suitable Sc-doped TiO2.137 The results revealed that the formation of the Ti–O–Sc species promoted the lattice stability and improved the PDH performance. Song et al. reported that Ru-doping can be used to regulate the electron structure and oxygen vacancy content, obtaining an enhanced catalytic activity for catalyzing the PDH process (Fig. 12f).135 Moreover, based on the DFT calculations, Xiao et al. pointed out that V-modified TiO2 also presented higher PDH activity owing to the increased oxygen vacancy content.138
In general, numerous efforts have been devoted to the development of non-precious metal-based catalysts to substitute the commercial Pt-based and toxic Cr-based catalysts, while it is difficult to meet the requirements of the practical application. In particular, the loss of active species, relatively low activity and inferior stability should be brought to the forefront and improved during the long-term reaction–regeneration evaluations.
3.3.7 Metal-free catalysts Metal-free catalysts exhibit great advantages including their cost effective, earth-abundant and environmental benign nature when employed as PDH catalysts. Hu et al. prepared a series of catalysts consisting of active oxygen functional group doped multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to catalyze the PDH reaction, suggesting a benign linear relationship between the initial propylene formation rate and the contents of CO groups.139 They further indicated that the CO functional group was the primary active center. Wang and co-workers synthesized a core–shell structure of carbon nanomaterials with different contents of sp2/sp3-carbon by consecutive pyrolysis.140 The authors indicated that the sp2 carbon matrix with CO groups was the actual active center in catalyzing the PDH reaction. Büchele et al. designed catalysts containing diverse aniline derived carbon and active carbon with various structural properties, heteroatom compositions and functional groups (Fig. 13).141 The microporous carbon material with rich CO active groups endowed the resulting catalyst with excellent catalytic performance through post-treatment by KOH etching.

It is widely believed that metal-free catalysts exhibit inferior activity compared to metal-based catalysts in PDH reactions. The major reason can be the great changes on active sites during catalytic conversion. For instance, irreversible changes occurred on the CO active groups during the propane dehydrogenation process.141 The water loss led to the oxygenated groups’ deactivation; meanwhile, the recovery of the corresponding oxygenated groups was limited. Furthermore, the corresponding active groups were difficult to recover after the catalytic conversion of the alkane. At present, even though the metal-free carbon material presents a satisfactory catalytic activity, it also brings about difficulty in the realistic application owing to the activity degradation along with the regeneration process. Hence, it is still essential to explore a probable recovery route of active species for metal-free carbon-based materials.
With the rapid development of advanced characterization techniques, the reaction process and catalytic mechanism can be clearly revealed. It is conceivable that a series of novel catalysts with rational configurations and low cost will prevail for the marketplace. For instance, metallic oxide (MOx) nanocomposite catalysts, by combining the advantages of advanced synthetic strategies and characterization techniques, may be successfully replaced by the current catalysts in the near future.
4. Advanced synthetic strategies for catalyst design
Currently, the main bottleneck originates from catalysts with low performance along with restricted lifespan, which are also considered as the important metrics to achieve economic profit and significant requirements in the industrial field. It has exerted a profound influence on PDH industrial production by reducing the reaction–regeneration process, which could be achieved by optimizing catalysts with exceptional activity and robust stability. Beyond this, the side reactions need to be avoided through designing catalysts with high selectivity and affinity to break the C–H bond rather than the C–C bond. Meanwhile, the reactant intermediate (C3H6*) is necessary to possess a moderate adsorption ability to the active sites, otherwise it will cause a deep cracking reaction. Taking this point into consideration, the subsequent sections mainly focus on the typical development strategies to improve the activity of PDH catalysts.
4.1 Seed-oriented growth
Xiao et al. proposed a seed-directed growth method to prepare metallic nanocatalysts with a uniform size of 0.8–3.6 nm, which exhibited outstanding performance in various applications.142 The key point of this strategy is to provide a shell on the surface of the metal nanoparticle-containing zeolite seeds with the addition of a gel (silicate or aluminosilicate gel). Benefiting from the protection shell, metallic nanoparticles favorably resisted the sintering agglomeration in a high temperature reaction environment. Noteworthily, the metal nanoparticles were confined by the zeolite coating, thus possessing adequate particle size in the catalytic reaction and avoiding the unfavorable parasitic reaction. Compared with the catalysts prepared by the traditional method with side reactions, the seed-directed growth strategy could provide nanoparticles encapsulated in zeolites with a well-defined structure, providing an optimized reaction selectivity to C–H bond cleavage in catalyzing the PDH process. Being aimed at improving stability, the above-mentioned strategy also could be developed to design catalysts with suitable size and dispersion. Certainly, the effect and performance of catalysts prepared by using this strategy require further confirmation in the PDH application. Taking this into consideration, Tan and co-workers induced an interface interaction by coating a SiO2 layer on a PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst, demonstrating the immobilization effect of the protecting shell and outstanding PDH performance.143 In view of this, the fusion of methodological innovations can provide new insights in the field of propane dehydrogenation.
4.2 Ligand-protected direct H2 reduction
Until now, significant attention has been paid to pure siliceous materials in order to evade the inherent acidic defects of conventional Al2O3. However, the well-defined zeolite also brings concerns about a crystallization process with the hazardous synthesis conditions (high temperature or strong alkali), resulting in the detrimental effect of metal aggregation and the low efficiency of metal species. As for zeolite supported metal-based catalysts developed by the wet impregnation method, the weak SMSI cause an inferior activity in catalyzing the PDH reaction. Meanwhile, the surface exposed metal encounters a grievous migration and aggregation process, leading to fast deactivation in the PDH process due to the severe reaction conditions. The ligand-protected direct H2 reduction strategy has been confirmed for its large-scale implementation in the exploitation of high-performance catalysts in the application of PDH reactions. Besides, the ligands effectively protected the metal from aggregation in the hydrothermal reaction. The well-protected metal can be encapsulated in the zeolite crystal in a direct H2 reduction step with the help of the cavity, channel, pore wall and framework.144 By utilizing this strategy, sub-nanometer and even single atom distributed metallic components could be successfully obtained, which act as the active species in catalyzing the PDH reaction with satisfactory performance and stability toward promising applications.
4.3 Confinement effect
Although the C–H bond cleavage in the PDH reaction is insensitive to the size effect, taking into consideration the atomic efficiency along with side reactions, the size of active metallic components should be controlled. Based on the composition principle of heterogeneous catalysts, the support is a necessary element to carry active species. Therefore, supports with well-designed texture properties greatly affect the distribution of active metallic species. Ryoo and co-workers developed a mesoporous zeolite with the utilization of a dual structure-directing agent by the hydrothermal crystallization steps.79 Zeolite possessed an exceptional confinement effect in the formation of PtZn intermetallic alloy active components, which provided a favorable performance in catalyzing the PDH process. Moreover, Zhu et al. synthesized a hierarchical desilication ZSM-5 support by alkali etching, and then the well-distributed PtSn bimetallic nanogranules were wrapped in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5.145 The authors indicated that the excellent activity along with the robust stability can be attributed to the confinement effect of mesopores in the support. Beale et al. designed the defective functional group of silanol and framework of Sn(iv) for achieving an exceptional Pt dispersion by means of the geometric constraint properties from zeolite micropores.56 Owing to the specific function of confinement, a series of modifications on supports could improve the performance of catalysts in the PDH reaction, and provided a new consideration to guide the rational design of exceptional PDH catalysts.
4.4 Electronic modifications
Electronic modifications drastically decreased the side reactions during the PDH process by the introduction of metal heteroatoms, in which the formed dual metallic species exhibited outstanding stability owing to the enhanced anti-transferring ability and reduced coke deposition. For instance, Rosowski and coworkers provided an original electronic modification strategy to achieve exactly bimetallic nanoparticles by modifying the interface interaction between metal components and the support.146 They demonstrated that the optimal performance originated from the formation of an alloy with a regulated electronic structure. Due to the donor effect of enriched-electrons benefiting the desorption of the intermediate (C3H6*), the optimized metal component with precisely electronic-regulating behavior showed better C3H6 selectivity and coking-resistance in the PDH reaction.
4.5 Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)
The utilization of SOMC could help develop a compound with well-defined surface sites, in which the coordination environment is already detected to some extent, thus favoring the investigations of activity–structure relationship and the development of ideal heterogeneous catalysts. To this end, Zhu et al. developed an ultrafine dual metallic Pt–Sn cluster with a size of 0.75 nm based on SOMC, and the obtained Pt–Sn/θ-Al2O3 catalyst presented exceeding performance in PDH catalysis.147 They opened up a way to obtain a bimetallic nanoparticle with a size below 1 nm; meanwhile, it offered an ideal pathway for dealing with the phase segregation during high-temperature synthesis. Obviously, this SOMC approach serves as an empirical application strategy to promote the development of heterogeneous catalysis. Basically, the key point is to explore a suitable support with surface oxygenated functional –OH groups or even bonded ligand-enriched groups for grafting the metal site, thus obtaining ideal heterogeneous catalysts.
Besides the development of various synthetic strategies, the performance of corresponding catalysts has been close to the industrial level with appreciable conversion and selectivity. The catalysts prepared by the seed-oriented growth strategy exhibit more efficient coking resistance in contrast to other mentioned methodologies. On the one hand, initial metallic nanoparticles could be trapped by the support due to the chemical bonding effect, which inhibits the agglomeration of the metallic species. Owing to the coating effect, the post-synthetic strategy leads to the formation of a protecting shell, which further protects metallic active species from transferring and gathering. Hence, due to the synergistic effect of physiochemical restriction, the catalysts developed by the seed-oriented growth approach generally demonstrate an outstanding PDH performance especially for target propylene selectivity and coking-resistance ability.
Despite inferior stability, tremendous efforts have been devoted to develop catalysts with superior structural stability especially in the PDH-O2 process. For instance, boron nitrides with a specific three-dimensional porous fiber-like morphology and appropriate carbon doping have been developed and applied to the PDH-O2 process, exhibiting outstanding performance during dehydrogenation stages.148,149 This work provides a guide to structural design coupled with local atom regulation, achieving superior activity along with stability. Besides, other optional approaches such as co-feeding gas have also attracted intensive attention. It is worth considering the expense of co-feeding gas. Meanwhile, the corresponding gas separation process also needs further development. In summary, further investigations should combine the multiple superior qualities of each strategy, devoting efforts towards developing the pioneering field.
5. Conclusion and outlook
Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is one of the most valued industrial production technologies, which satisfies the worldwide propylene ingredient requirement. The widely used propane dehydrogenation process involves expensive Pt-based catalysts and harmful Cr-based catalysts, in which the high cost and toxicity severely limit their application in modern society. Furthermore, Pt-based catalysts present lots of drawbacks such as the expensive Pt resource, the complicated purification of feed gas, and the post-treatment of harmful chlorine-containing tail gas. Besides, Cr-based catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation, the irreversible formation of CrO3 species, and unfavorable environmental factors. Moreover, the activity, selectivity, and long-term lifetime have a significant effect on the industrial process. Thus, a great deal of studies has been devoted to developing advanced catalysts to overcome the inherent weakness of Pt-/Cr-based catalysts. Typically, improved activity and stability could be achieved by controlling the loading amounts of constituents to reduce the cost and utilizing an appropriate support to boost the SMSI as well as dispersion of active species. Moreover, the introduction of adequate additives can stabilize the active species and improve the activity, which greatly improve the overall performance including conversion, selectivity, stability, and service life of the Pt-/Cr-based catalysts.
To substitute the commercial catalysts, other catalysts also are deeply explored to gain a comprehensive understanding of the high performance and reaction mechanism. For instance, VOx-based catalysts with outstanding PDH activity have been validated. However, the undetermined active components and the loss of active species along with the fast deactivation seem to bring about new problems to the practical application. SnOx-based catalysts exhibit obvious advantages in the PDH reaction, but the low melting point of Sn in the form of liquid phase leads to the migration of active constituents and the corresponding deactivation behavior. ZnOx-based catalysts with low cost show an advantage in catalyzing the PDH reaction, but the intrinsic Lewis acid site would activate the side reaction with regard to the low olefin selectivity. Some strategies such as the modification of acidity and structural properties in the support have been used to improve the stability of catalysts. Moreover, transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, etc.)-based catalysts are also restricted by their relatively low activity and recycle regeneration challenge. For nanocarbon materials, a similar puzzle is always encountered in the regeneration process. In summary, the above catalyst materials present certain advantages in catalyzing the PDH process, but the intrinsic low activity and the loss of active components along with the coke deposition still are the major bottlenecks in the industrial application. Therefore, employing the optimized strategy to develop advanced catalysts with highly dispersed active components and long-term stability to deal with the coke deposition and sintering agglomeration, have a profound significance in the future industrial application.
In order to achieve industrial applications, the following aspects should be considered to design and prepare the PDH catalysts. Firstly, the cost of catalysts should be taken into full consideration. Besides, the lifetime of catalysts should be extended to obtain profits. Thus, we speculate that the vanadium-based catalysts may exert a profound influence in future developments with the following reasons. (1) V-based catalysts exhibit similar properties to Cr-based catalysts. Highly charged vanadium ions like V5+/V4+ could be converted into active V3+ species in the PDH process, which greatly improves the propane conversion and propylene yield. (2) V-based catalysts, with relatively low toxicity and environmental benignity, comply with the development of the green sustainable trend. (3) Vanadium exhibits the advantage of low price, serving as a nonprecious metal resource. Vanadium-containing resources are abundant in the southwestern part of Sichuan Province and meanwhile the reasonable application of vanadium resources could promote the local economy. More importantly, the advantages of V-based catalysts will be gradually presented with the assistance of structural and functional properties.
From the perspective of developing advanced catalysts with high performance, vanadium should be oriented towards practical applications. Future investigation direction should be concentrated on the following aspects: (1) employing ingenious strategies to design catalysts with outstanding activity, robust stability and high selectivity; (2) investigating the realistic reactive components by using in situ/ex situ characterization; (3) establishing a rational model to simulate the practical reaction situation corresponding to a determined reaction mechanism. In summary, innovative design of new-type catalysts are needed to promote the development of industrial application. This review provides a guiding principle and new avenue to synthesize industrial grade catalysts for accomplishing their authentic application.
