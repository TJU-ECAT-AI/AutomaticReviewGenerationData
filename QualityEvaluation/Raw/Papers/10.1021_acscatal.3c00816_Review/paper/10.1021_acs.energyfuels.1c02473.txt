Abstract
In this work, a silicalite membrane reactor was used for the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction for different operating conditions such as 550–650 °C for temperature and 1–5 atm for pressure, respectively. Packed bed membrane reactors (PBMRs) were allowed to achieve higher performance than packed bed reactors, thereby overcoming thermodynamic limitations that are prevalent in dehydrogenation reactions. Removal of one of the reaction products (H2) during the reaction from the reaction side helped in improving PDH reaction performance of PBMR. Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were used with the silicalite membrane to explore the impact of operating conditions on the PDH reaction. Increasing reaction temperature accelerated the reaction rate, which led to an increase in propane conversion. Increasing reaction pressure led to an increase in H2 permeation across the membrane, which resulted in considerable improvement in the propane conversion. The highest propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield achieved were 49, 97, and 47%, respectively, at 600 °C and 5 atm in the PBMR mode. The selective removal of H2 from the reaction side through the membrane was also found to significantly reduce the side products such as methane. A one-dimensional plug flow model was developed and found to work well for simulating the PDH reaction.

1. Introduction
Propylene is an essential intermediate chemical for the production of several petrochemicals such as polypropylene and acrylonitrile. Next to ethylene, it is the most important chemical in the chemical industry. (1) The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction is a vital step in the production of propylene (C3H6) and later polypropylene. (2−7) Propylene and other light olefins are mainly produced from light oil fractions via steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. (8,9) Common reactors used for the PDH reaction are fixed bed reactors, fluidized bed reactors, and membrane reactors (MRs). (10−14) Pt or Pt–Sn catalysts have been extensively used for the PDH reaction. (15−18)
(1)
There have been multiple studies for the PDH reaction in MR. Chang et al. (19) performed the PDH reaction in a high-temperature tubular MR containing a Pd-coated γ-Al2O3 membrane with Pt/K/Sn/Al2O3 catalysts. With a Pd membrane, propane conversion was twice as high as the equilibrium values and 6 times higher than traditional reactor (TR) propane conversion. Ricca et al. (1) studied the PDH reaction with a Pd-based membrane. Due to the selective removal of hydrogen from the reaction side, the reaction could be performed at relatively lower temperature and coke formation also decreased. Peters et al. (20) investigated the PDH reaction using a Pd-based membrane. It was observed that coke formation was significant under the operating conditions (450–500 °C) and a low H2 to propylene ratio. The effect of the steam content on the catalyst and membrane activity and stability was also investigated in sequential MR processes. It was found that the presence of steam aided the catalyst stability, but the amount of H2 produced remained unchanged when the steam content was between 7 and 20%. A stable membrane performance was obtained at 200 °C at a hydrogen recovery factor varying from 38 to 50%.
A number of works have addressed propane conversion and propylene selectivity of PDH reactions. Wu et al. (21) used a Pd/Ag composite hollow fiber MR by depositing <1 μm sized Pt (0.5 wt %)/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for the PDH reaction. At 450 °C, propane conversion of 42% was reported in the hollow fiber MR at the early stage of the reaction, but it diminished to 6% after 40 min of the reaction due to the deactivation of the catalyst. Yildirim et al. (22) studied the performance of silica, dense Pd–Ag, and Pd-dispersed membrane systems on the PDH reaction, respectively. The Pd–Ag membrane showed very high H2 selectivity and thus a higher performance made a fourfold conversion increase on the equilibrium at a relatively low temperature of 400 °C. Sheintuch et al. (23) presented a kinetic model for PDH on PtSn/Mg(Al)O which accounted for the product distribution of the main and side reactions, for deactivation rates, and for diffusion resistance. Parameters were estimated from steady-state experiments by varying the reaction pressure from temperature-programmed experiments and were compared with previously published models with similar catalysts. These models suggested that pressure needs to be maintained below 5 bar and steam content ∼10% in feed. Meanwhile, pellet size was found to mainly affect the selectivity and its effect on conversion was very small.
Some reports have addressed optimization of processing and material variables. (24,25) Didenko et al. (26) used the PDH reaction in MR to investigate the effect of Pd membrane thickness, temperature, space velocity, and flow rate of sweep gas on the process behavior. To maintain the balance of the reaction rate under various conditions, the operating conditions such as temperature, feed rate, and sweep gas flow rate consumption were optimized. Schäfer et al. (27) studied the PDH reaction in a high-temperature catalytic packed bed MR (PBMR) with a H2-selective silica membrane and a commercial Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. Due to the removal of H2 in the MR, high propane conversion was achieved in comparison to an analogous fixed bed TR. H2 removal in the MR increased coking of the catalyst, where the performances of the MR and TR were similar after 200–300 min. Ziaka et al. (28) investigated the PDH reaction in MR with a sol gel alumina membrane and a commercial 5% Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The propane conversion was 22% in the MR and 11% in the TR at 550 °C, respectively, which could be attributed to the separation and removal of H2 and propylene in MR. Collins et al. (29) performed the PDH reaction in microporous silica-based MRs and packed bed reactors (PBRs) with a Pt-loaded aluminosilicate catalyst. Silica MR showed propylene yield 1.5 times higher than the TR yield with the same flow rate at 550 °C. The catalyst deactivation rates in MRs were generally higher than those of PBRs. Liu et al. (30) investigated the PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, which was promoted by the doping of indium (In) for the PDH reaction. It was found that In doping improved catalytic performance and stability of the PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The presence of In not only maintained the catalytic activity and propylene selectivity but also suppressed the hydrogenolysis reaction during the PDH reaction. Propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 41 and 96%, respectively, were obtained after 53 h operation.
In addition, SAPO-34 membranes have been investigated extensively for the PDH reaction. (31) Kim et al. (32) performed a high-temperature PDH reaction using small-pore SAPO-34 membranes. Structure-directing agents were used to modify the membrane in order to obtain high H2 permeance and good H2/hydrocarbon selectivity. With a modified SAPO-34 membrane, propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 65–70 and 80% were achieved, respectively. Nawaz and Wei (33) used a Pt–Sn-based SAPO-34-supported novel catalyst for the PDH reaction. The catalyst showed excellent stability for mild steaming and was characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, O2 pulse analysis of coke, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption. Propylene yield and selectivity of 23 and 94% were obtained, respectively. About 98% of the catalyst activity was recovered by redispersing Pt using the chlorination technique. Wang et al. (34) used SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membranes fabricated by a secondary growth method for the separation of binary mixture (H2 and C3H8) or ternary mixture (H2, C3H8, and C3H6) in the PDH reaction. A high H2 permeance of 3.1 × 10–7 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1 and a H2/C3H8 selectivity of 41 were obtained at 600 °C.
Although there have been multiple studies on PDH in the conventional reactors and MRs, the reports on high-temperature and high-pressure PDH PBMR have been so far very limited. In particular, there have been few reports on the effect of reaction side pressure on the MR performance of the PDH reaction. In this work, we used silicalite PBMR to study the effect of reaction pressure and other operating conditions such as temperature, space velocity, and sweep gas flow rate on the reactor performance in the PDH reaction. A one-dimensional (1D) plug flow reactor (PFR) model was developed for simulating the PBMR and PBR. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of pressure on Ø (ratio of H2 production/ratio of H2 permeation) and observed the relationship between H2 production and H2 permeation under various reaction conditions.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Membrane Preparation Procedure
The silicalite membrane was used in performing the PDH reaction. A secondary growth method was utilized to fabricate the silicalite membrane on the dip-coated α-Al2O3 disk. Macroporous α-alumina disks (CoorsTek) with 1 mm thickness, 25% porosity, and 1 in. diameter were used as supports for silicalite membrane fabrication. The detailed membrane fabrication procedure is described in our previous work. (35−37) Silicalite seeds were dip-coated on α-alumina disks and then dried in order to prepare seeded α-alumina disks using the same procedures described elsewhere. (36,38) Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%, Acros) was added dropwise to the synthesis solution, and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 1 M, Sigma-Aldrich) in deionized water was added under constant stirring for 3 h. The final precursor (molar composition of TEOS/0.095 TPAOH/35.42 H2O) was transferred into a stainless-steel autoclave (Parr) containing a vertically placed α-alumina disk. The seeded disk was totally submerged into the synthesis solution, and the fabrication was performed for 17 h at 150 °C. After hydrothermal synthesis, deionized water was used to wash the membrane surface which was then dried and finally calcined at 550 °C in air for ∼6 h in order to remove the templates. Afterward, the membranes were dried for ∼12 h at 70 °C.
The membranes were then tested for MR experiments and gas separation experiments. Initially, membranes were checked for equimolar H2/CO2 gas separation to test the quality of membranes at room temperature. The H2/CO2 gas separation factor less than 1 at room temperature indicated the good quality of the silicalite membrane as the zeolite surface prefers the adsorption of CO2, which explains the separation factor less than 1. Subsequently, equimolar H2/propane and H2/propylene gas mixture permeation experiments were conducted in temperature intervals from room temperature to 600 °C. Gas permeance for component i is calculated as follows

where Qi (mol/s) is the flow rate of gas across the membrane in a time period of t (s); Am (m2) is the useful area of the membrane (∼2 cm2) excluding the graphite gasket area; and ΔPi (Pa) is the pressure difference, ΔPi = (Pi)f – (Pi)p, where (Pi)f (partial pressure in the feed side) and (Pi)p (partial pressure in the permeate side) for component i, respectively. Permselectivity for a gas mixture H2/C3H8 is calculated using the ratio of individual gas permeance

2.2. PDH Reaction
Figure 1 shows the schematic used for PDH in the MR system. The MR experiments were performed in an apparatus similar to the one described in our previous publication. (39,40) The stainless-steel cell was sealed by graphite gaskets (Mercer Gasket & Shim) after the disc membrane was mounted in it. The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (550 mg) was spread homogeneously over the membrane in order to make a uniform catalyst bed. At atmospheric pressure, the permeate side was swept by Ar and its flow rate was maintained at 20 cm3/min for all the experiments, except when the effect of FAr was studied. Flow rates of propane and Ar were controlled by mass flow controllers (Aalborg).

Soap bubble tests were used frequently to monitor the flow rate of the outlet stream from the reactor, and preheating coils were used for both feed and sweep gases to make sure that gases attained the set temperature. Online gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC 2014) was used to analyze the retentate and permeate gases. To study the impact of operating conditions on reaction performance, reaction products such as propylene, unreacted propane, H2, and other byproducts (methane, xylene, toluene, and benzene) were analyzed. There were other minor byproducts that were significantly less than 1% and were not included in the calculation. The propane conversion was calculated as follows

The catalyst used in the PDH reaction was 1 wt % Pt/Al2O3. For using the reaction system in the PBR mode, entering sweeping gas was not used and reaction side exit was connected to the sweep gas inlet. For the experiment and modeling of PDH reactions, the operating conditions are summarized in Table 1.

The permeance of gas i as a function of temperature is shown in eq 12. Permeance as a function of temperature is required to perform calculations for the MR modeling. Data from equimolar binary gas separation experiments were regressed to fit into eq 12. H2/propane and H2/propylene binary gas separation data from RT to 600 °C at 1 atm were fit into eq 12, and the corresponding parameters such as Pm,i° and Ea,i for gases were calculated by regressing the permeation data.

2.3. PDH Reaction Modeling
The main aim of the modeling is to understand the impact of membrane quality and the different operating conditions on the reaction performance and then to optimize operating conditions for the reaction. Parameters needed for reaction rate calculations for the PDH modeling were evaluated by controlled experiments. 13 show the equations used for the modeling study. The equilibrium constant (Keq) and rate constant (k) were calculated by the PDH reaction in the PBR mode. Different compositions of gases such as C3H8, C3H6, and H2 were used in the feed gas. Controlled experiments were conducted by varying the C3H8 flow rate and keeping the flow rate of the other two gases constant at each temperature. The two different gas mixtures with different compositions that were used in the feed for each temperature were (1) 33.3, 33.3, and 33.3 and (2) 50, 25, and 25% for propane, propylene, and hydrogen, respectively. The corresponding partial pressures of each gas and the reaction rate were calculated for each flow rate for different temperatures using the concentration of exiting gases after the system reached a steady state. Afterward, the two corresponding equations were solved numerically at each temperature to calculate k and Keq under that particular condition. The constant of rate and the constant of equilibrium were calculated at different temperatures and were fit in eqs 14 and 15.

where R is the gas constant, Keq (atm) is the constant of equilibrium, E (J mol–1) is the activation energy, and k (mol s–1 gcatalyst–1 Pa–1) is the constant of rate.
Assumptions used in building the model were similar to our previous works. (37) Modeling results were validated with results obtained from the experiment, and then, the model was used to calculate PBMR reaction performance beyond the operating conditions that were used during experiments. The following equations were used for the mass balance in a differential section of the reactor

(18)
where mc (g) is the mass of the catalyst, ni is the rate of product formation by the reaction (mol s–1), Pm,i (mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1) is the component i permeance, Qi (mol s–1) is the gas flow rate across the membrane, νi is the stoichiometric coefficient of species i, Fi (mol s–1) is the molar flow rate, and ΔPi (Pa) is the pressure difference for component i across the membrane. Differential equations were solved numerically by dividing the reactor into equal 150 sections. By putting Qi = 0, the PFR model is obtained by eq 16.
The feed flow rate was varied for the controlled experiments at 550–650 °C to evaluate the PDH reaction parameters in rate expression. Figure 2 shows the process used in calculating the constants E, A, k0, and B in eqs 14 and 15 at each temperature. Equation 19 presents the overall equation for the reaction rate for the PDH reaction with the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which is only applicable to investigate the specific reaction conditions for this particular study.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Silicalite Membrane Properties
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the surface and cross section of the silicalite membrane are shown in Figure 3. The membrane was very well grown with negligible defects. The thickness of the membrane was ∼7 μm.
Figure 3

The silicalite membrane was investigated for equimolar H2/C3H8 and H2/C3H6 separation from room temperature to 600 °C (Figure 4). At room temperature, the membrane was more selective toward C3H8 and C3H6, and H2/C3H8 and H2/C3H6 separation factors were 0.31 and 0.52, respectively. However, H2/C3H8 and H2/C3H6 separation factors increased with increasing temperature. This can be understood by the fact that at room temperature, adsorption dominates separation and hydrocarbons adsorb more on the silicalite surface in comparison to H2. As temperature increases, diffusion dominates separation and smaller H2 diffuses faster than C3H8 and C3H6, and thus, H2 permeance increases faster with increasing temperature, which further causes the increase in H2/C3H8 and H2/C3H6 separation factors, 5.7 and 4.4 at 600 °C, respectively.

3.2. PDH Reaction
3.2.1. Impact of Reaction Temperature
High-temperature stability and separation performance for H2/C3H8 and H2/C3H6 at 600 °C made the silicalite membrane an ideal candidate for studying the impact of operating conditions on the PDH MR reaction. The impact of temperature on PDH MR performance was investigated in the range of 550–650 °C with propane as the feed, a WHSV of 1.1 h–1, and an FAr of 20 cm3/min (Figure 5a–c). With an increase in temperature, the reaction occurs at a faster rate due to its endothermic nature, which causes more propylene to form. Thus, PDH reaction performance increased for both PBR and PBMR. For all operating conditions, PDH reaction performance was higher in PBMR than in PBR and the equilibrium limit. The 1D model accurately predicted the trends on the propane conversion. However, conversion values obtained from the experiment were slightly higher than the conversion values obtained from the modeling for PBR. This is because there were multiple side reactions, which not only cause the production of multiple minor products such as ethane, ethylene, and methane but such minor reactions also contributed to the conversion. However, for the modeling, only the pure PDH reaction was considered. For PBMR, the model calculated a little higher values than experimental values possibly because the permeance of C3H8, C3H6, and H2 was considered constant in calculation, but the permeance values decreased over time due to coke deposition on the membrane surface during the experiment. Also, as can be seen in Figure 5c, Ø decreased with temperature. With an increase in temperature, both reaction and permeation rates increased; however, the permeation rate increased faster than the reaction rate. Thus, it led to the reduction in Ø and also shifting of equilibrium to the forward direction, which eventually caused the increase of PDH reaction performance.

Figure 5. Impact of reaction temperature on (a) propane conversion, (b) propylene selectivity, and propylene yield and (c) Ø (WHSV = 1.1 h–1; pperm = 1 atm; and FAr = 20 cm3/min).
3.2.2. Impact of Space Velocity
Figure 6 shows the impact of WHSV on the PDH reaction at a WHSV of 0.82–2.74 h–1, an FAr of 20 cm3/min, and 600 °C. At lower WHSV, propane spends longer time in the catalyst bed, so a highest propane conversion of 48% was achieved for a smallest WHSV of 0.66 h–1. Similarly, the reactant spends small time at higher WHSV inside the reactor, which is the reason for the decrease in PDH reaction performance (C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity). With an increase in WHSV, the reaction rate decreased and there was no impact on the permeation rate, which caused the substantial decrease in Ø with the increase in WHSV.

Figure 6. Impact of WHSV on (a) propane conversion, (b) propylene selectivity, and propylene yield and (c) Ø (temperature = 600 °C; pperm = 1 atm; and FAr = 20 cm3/min).
3.2.3. Impact of Sweeping Gas
The impact of FAr on the PDH MR reaction was investigated. As shown in Figure 7a,b, propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield for the PBMRs increased with increasing FAr. With an increase in FAr, the partial pressure of hydrogen decreased in the permeate side, whereas the partial pressure in the retentate side remained the same. This caused enhancement in the driving force for H2 permeation through the membrane. Thus, hydrogen is removed effectively, which moves the reaction equilibrium to the forward side and higher reaction performance was obtained. Also, with increasing FAr, the permeation rate increased without substantial change in the reaction rate, which reduced Ø as can be seen in Figure 7c.
Figure 7
Figure 7. Impact of FAr on (a) propane conversion, (b) propylene selectivity, and propylene yield and (c) Ø (temperature = 600 °C; pperm = 1 atm; and WHSV = 1.1 h–1).
3.2.4. Impact of Reaction Pressure
The impact of the reaction side pressure was studied for the range of 1–5 atm on the PDH reaction using the silicalite membrane (Figure 8a–c). Experiments were performed at 500 and 600 °C, respectively, with the propane feed, a WHSV of 1.1 h–1, and an FAr of 20 cm3/min. As expected, PBMR exhibited higher propane conversion than the equilibrium limit and PBR conversion. In PBR, with an increase in pressure, propane conversion decreased because in the PDH reaction, the number of moles in product side is more than that in the reactant side, and therefore, an enhancement in pressure shifts the equilibrium to the side of the reactant. However, in PBMR, the propane conversion enhanced with an increase in pressure. With an increase in pressure, more hydrogen permeates across the membrane, which shifts the reaction equilibrium to the product side in the case of PBMR. This allows the propane conversion to increase from 39% at 1 atm to 49% at 5 atm for PBMR. The 1D PFR model results were compared with the experimental results. The model correctly predicted the trends for the pressure effect on propane conversion. However, the PBMR predictions from the model were slightly higher than experimental values. The reduction in the real permeance values (H2, C3H8, and C3H6) was not considered in the modeling, which is likely due to the coke deposition on the membrane surface with time. This was probably responsible for the higher propane conversion values from the modeling. Moreover, the PBR model estimated slightly lower values for the propane conversion values possibly because no side reactions were considered in the model though there were considerable quantity of byproducts (methane, ethylene, and isobutylene) from many minor reactions. Figure 8c shows that with an increase in pressure, Ø decreased which can be understood by the substantial enhancement in the permeation rate across the membrane due to an increase in reaction pressure.
Figure 8

Figure 9 shows the impact of the reaction side pressure on propylene selectivity and propylene yield. With an increase in reaction pressure, propylene selectivity and yield of propylene increased in PBMR. More propylene was formed with an increase in pressure, causing the increase in propylene selectivity and yield of propylene. However, in the PBR mode, increasing pressure decreased the amount of propylene formed because the number of moles of product is more than that of the reactant, which reduced both propylene selectivity and yield of propylene, as shown in Figure 9.

3.2.5. Hydrogen Purity and Recovery
Impact of reaction side pressure on yH2,p and RH2 in the PBMR mode is shown in Figure 10. Driving force for hydrogen permeation across the membrane increased with reaction pressure, which enhanced RH2. Though RH2 enhanced with pressure, yH2,p depicted a diminishing behavior with increasing reaction side pressure, which was likely because along with H2, unreacted propane and propylene also permeated across the membrane due to moderate H2/C3H8 and H2/C3H6 separation factors, 5.7 and 4.4 at 600 °C, respectively. This caused the decrease of yH2,p because there is more unreacted propane in the feed side than H2, and thus, in a proportional amount, it permeated through the membrane. Due to this, a higher amount of propane was available in the side of permeate than hydrogen at higher pressure and yH2,p decreased with an increase in pressure.

3.2.6. Methanation
Methane is the important side product in the PDH reaction. The effect of pressure on methane selectivity was investigated for both PBMR and PBR at 500 and 600 °C. FAr and WHSV were maintained at 20 cm3/min and 1.1 h–1, respectively. As can be seen in Figure 11, the selectivity of methane decreased with enhancing pressure in PBMR because increasing pressure enhanced the permeation of hydrogen through the membrane, an important reactant (eqs 20 and 21) for the methane formation. It essentially suppressed methanation due to less hydrogen available in the reactant side. (15) However, for PBR, the amount of H2 available was higher than that of PBMR, which explains higher methane selectivity for PBR in Figure 11.

3.3. Model Results
We used the 1D PFR model to explore the impact of pressure on the performance of PBR and PBMR for the PDH reaction beyond experimental operating conditions. Figure 12 shows the impact of reaction temperature and pressure on propane conversion in PBMR. Modeling was performed for WHSV = 1.1 and 2.1 h–1, a temperature of 500–800 °C, a reaction side pressure of 1–6 atm, and an FAr of 20 cm3/min. It was found that enhancing reaction temperature and reaction side pressure increased propane conversion. However, propane conversion started to level off at ∼6 atm. One explanation can be that the rate of the product formation starts matching the rate of product permeation across the membrane above 6 atm. The highest propane conversion obtained was ∼96% at 800 °C and 6 atm for WHSV = 1.1 h–1. These results show that both pressure and temperature play a significant role in propane conversion and that a membrane with moderate separation performance can still achieve high propane conversion under appropriate operating conditions.
Figure 12

Figure 13 shows the effect of the reaction side pressure on propane conversion against the reactor length for PBMR and PBR. Along the reactor length, propane conversion for PBMR increased with the increasing reaction side pressure, which could be due to the enhancement in hydrogen permeation through the membrane. However, for PBR, propane conversion reduced along the reactor length for an increase in reaction side pressure because PDH is a volume expansion reaction. An enhancement in reaction side pressure for PBR shifts the equilibrium toward the reactant side and makes propane conversion slow.

Figure 14 shows the effect of reaction side pressure and the area of membrane on PDH MR performance. The membrane area is depicted as A/A0, where A is the membrane area used in modeling and A0 is the membrane area used in the experiment (2.0 cm2). The membrane area had a substantial impact on propane conversion, which was as high as 99% at a pressure of 3.0 atm and an A/A0 of 1.5. The model performance was evaluated at an FAr of 20 cm3/min and a WHSV of 1.1 h–1.

4. Conclusions
The effect of different operating parameters such as temperature, pressure, space velocity, and sweep gas flow rate on the PDH reaction was studied using silicalite PBMR. The silicalite membrane showed a moderate separation performance for H2/propane, but using the membrane considerably helped in enhancing PDH reaction performance for PBMR. The 1D PFR model was used not only to validate experimental results but also to predict reaction performance beyond experimental conditions. The maximum propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield obtained were 49, 97, and 47%, respectively, at 600 °C, 1.1 h–1, FAr = 20 cm3/min, and pressure = 5 atm. H2 recovery (RH2) increased with increasing pressure as more H2 was transferred to the permeate side, but permeate side H2 concentration (yH2,p) reduced with an increase in pressure because propane and unreacted propylene also diffuse across the membrane, which reduced the concentration of H2 in the permeate side. Increasing reaction pressure reduced the methane selectivity for both PBMR and PBR. The model predicted the propane conversion results very well for both PBMR and PBR. The highest propane conversion predicted in the modeling was 99% at a WHSV of 1.1 h–1, a pressure of 3.0 atm, and an A/A0 of 1.5. The silicalite membrane was found to significantly enhance the propane conversion for the PDH reaction.
