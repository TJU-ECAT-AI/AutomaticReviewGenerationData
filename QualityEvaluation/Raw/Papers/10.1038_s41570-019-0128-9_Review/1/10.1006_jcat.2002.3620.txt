The mechanistic connections among propane oxidative dehydro-
genation (ODH) rates, H2 reduction rates, and the electronic tran-
sitions responsible for the absorption edge in the electronic spectra
of dispersed metal oxides were explored for VOx, MoOx, WOx, and
NbOx samples consisting predominately of two-dimensional oxide
domains supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, and MgO. For a given active
oxide, propane turnover rates increased in parallel with the reduc-
tion rate of the oxide catalyst using H2, but propane ODH rates dif-
fered signiﬁcantly among different metal oxide samples with similar
H2 reduction rates. For all catalysts, ODH turnover rates increased
monotonically as the energy of the absorption edge in the UV–visible
spectrum decreased. These results, taken together with the respec-
tive mechanisms for electron transfer during C–H bond activation
and during the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer processes responsi-
ble for the UV–visible edge, suggest that the stability of activated
complexes in C–H bond dissociation steps depends sensitively on
the ability of the active oxide domains to transfer electrons from
lattice oxygen atoms to metal centers. The electronic transitions re-
sponsible for the UV–visible absorption edge are mechanistically
related to the redox cycles involving lattice oxygens responsible
for oxidative dehydrogenation turnovers of alkanes. As a result,
the details of near-edge electronic spectra provide useful guidance

INTRODUCTION
The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane pro-
vides a low-temperature route for the synthesis of propene
(1–14). Catalyst compositions based on V and Mo oxides
have shown attractive ODH rates and propene selectivi-
ties (3). Several studies have probed primary and secon-
dary reactions responsible for the observed selectivity
during propane ODH reactions (1–3, 9–14). The kineti-
cally relevant steps for both propane dehydrogenation and
combustion reactions involve the activation of methylene

C–H bonds in propane (9). Detailed reaction kinetics and
mechanistic studies have shown that C–H bond activation
steps involve lattice oxygen atoms and that each reaction
turnover requires a two-electron reduction of high-valent
M+n cations to form one Mn−2 or two Mn−1 cations (9–11);
as a result of these cycles, the redox properties of oxides in-
ﬂuence their ability to catalyze such reaction turnovers. On
VOx- and MoOx-based catalysts, the rate constants for re-
oxidation of reduced centers using O2 are greater than for
their re-reduction by C–H bond activation steps. Several
studies (1–3, 14–21) have proposed that alkane ODH rates
increase as active metal oxides become more reducible,
without providing a rigorous deﬁnition of reducibility or
an appropriate method to measure it. The reduction peak
temperatures during reduction of oxides in H2 (14–23), gen-
erally used as a measure of reducibility, reﬂect instead the
nucleation and growth of a new crystal structure during a
stoichiometric reduction, and not merely the formation of
a few reduced centers in a structurally intact stoichiomet-
ric oxide. In addition, the mechanism of reduction using
H2 may differ from the related processes using propane as
the reductant, and the measured ODH reaction rates can
reﬂect a complex interplay between site reactivity and the
surface accessibility of oxide structures, which are seldom
atomically dispersed.
Here, we explore the electron transfer processes required
for C–H bond activation steps and the factors responsible
for the redox processes involved in each propane turnover.
Propane ODH turnover rates are reported on active oxi-
des (VOx, MoOx, NbOx, and WOx) dispersed as isolated
or two-dimensional species on the surface of inactive sup-
ports. These turnover rates are related to those for the in-
cipient formation of vacancies during the stoichiometric re-
duction of the oxides using H2 and to the energy required
for the ligand-to-metal electron transfer processes respon-
sible for the edge energy in the UV–visible absorption spec-
trum. A decrease in the energy required for local photore-
duction events occurring during this electron transfer was
accompanied by a faster C–H bond activation step during

propane ODH. Facile electron transfer between occupied
orbitals in lattice oxygen and empty states in the metal cen-
ters leads to more stable activated complexes in the kineti-
cally relevant elementary chemical steps for propane ODH
and to lower required photon energies for electron promo-
tion between these two energy levels.
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Al2O3, ZrO2, or MgO were used as inactive supports
for V2O5, MoO3, WO3, or Nb2O5 species predominately
present as isolated or two-dimensional structures. Sam-
ples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of
γ -Al2O3, ZrOx(OH)4−2x, or MgO with a solution of am-
monium vanadate (12, 13, 26), ammonium heptamolybd-
ate (14), ammonium metatungstate (24, 25), or ammonium
niobium oxalate (27). Impregnated samples were dried
overnight in ambient air at 393 K and then treated in ﬂow-
ing dry air at 773 K for 3 h. Surface areas were measured by
N2 physisorption at its normal boiling point using a Quan-
tasorb surface-area analyzer (Quantachrome Corporation)
and standard BET analysis methods.
The rates of stoichiometric reduction of these dispersed
metal oxides using H2 were measured using a Quantasorb
surface-area analyzer (Quantachrome Corporation) mod-
iﬁed with electronic mass-ﬂow controllers. Samples were
heated in 20% H2/Ar (1.33 cm3 s−1; Matheson UHP, certi-
ﬁed mixture) at 0.167 K s−1 to 1200 K. H2 concentrations
were measured using a thermal conductivity detector after
removing the water formed during reduction using a 13×
molecular sieve trap held at ambient temperature. The de-
tector response was calibrated using the reduction of CuO
powder (Aldrich, 99.995%). The samples were held within
a quartz cell (4 mm I.D.) containing a quartz thermowell
in contact with the sample bed. The amount of catalyst was
varied in order to maintain a constant number of metal
atoms in all experiments (space velocities, 0.22 mol H2/g-
atomV s−1 and0.34molH2/g-atomMo s−1).Theveryinitial
stages of reduction (oxygen conversion, <10%) were ana-
lyzed by ﬁtting the reduction rate data using an Arrhenius
dependence in order to obtain a rate constant as a function
of temperature for these low extents of reduction.
Diffuse reﬂectance UV–visible spectra were obtained us-
ing a Varian–Cary 4 spectrophotometer equipped with a
Harrick diffuse-reﬂectance attachment and an in situ re-
action chamber. MgO (Mallinckrodt, AR) powders were
used as a reference. Reﬂectance measurements were con-
verted to absorption spectra using the Kubelka–Munk func-
tion (28). UV–visible spectra were measured in the 1.5- to
5.0-eV photon energy range.
Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivi-
ties were measured at 703 K using a packed-bed tubular
quartz reactor and 0.01- to 0.3-g catalyst samples. Propane
(14 kPa; Airgas, 99.9%) and oxygen (1.7 kPa; Airgas,
99.999%) diluted with He (Airgas, 99.999%) were used
as reactants. Reactants and products were analyzed by gas
chromatography (Hewlett–Packard 5890 GC) using pro-
cedures described previously (12, 13). C3H8 and O2 con-
versions were varied by changing reactant space velocities
(F/w; w, catalyst mass; F, reactant volumetric ﬂow rate).
Reactant conversions were <2% for C3H8 and <20% for
O2. Initial propane turnover rates and selectivities were ob-
tained by extrapolation of these data to zero residence time
using reaction rate data obtained over a wide range of space
velocities. Rates and rate constants for secondary propene
combustion reactions were calculated from the correspond-
ing effects of bed residence time on product selectivity, us-
ing procedures reported previously (12, 13).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Surface areas and MOx surface densities (M = V, Mo,
W, or Nb) are shown in Table 1 for all samples. These sam-
ples were characterized by X-ray diffraction and by X-ray
absorption, Raman, and UV–visible spectroscopies. The
details of these measurements have been reported previ-
ously (12–14, 24–27). These methods showed that the ac-
tive oxide species at these surface densities consist pre-
dominately of two-dimensional oligomeric domains. These
two-dimensional structures expose most MOx structures
at surfaces, where they can be used for catalytic reaction
turnovers. Thus, reaction rates normalized by the number
of metal atoms in each sample become turnover rates, as a

result of the effective access of reactants to all MOx species.
Catalysts with bulk MOx clusters (detected by Raman or
X-ray diffraction) are not included in this study, but details
of their catalytic and structural properties can be found in
previous studies (12–15, 24–27).
Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are
shown in Fig. 1 as a function of MOx surface density for
VOx and MoOx species supported on Al2O3. On both types
of samples, turnover rates increased with increasing MOx
surface density. At a given MOx surface density, turnover
rates are greater on VOx than on MoOx samples, suggesting
that the redox cycles required for each ODH turnover oc-
cur more rapidly on VOx domains than on MoOx domains
of similar size. These differences are consistent with the
higher ODH reaction temperatures reported on Mo-based
compared with V-based catalysts (3).
Previous studies have suggested that the higher ODH
rates observed on VOx species reﬂect their more reducible
nature compared with that of MoOx species (14–21). These
studies, however, were not restricted to well-dispersed ox-
ides with completely accessible active oxides; thus, reported
reaction rates did not reﬂect the true activity of sites ex-
posed at the surface of MOx domains. Also, reduction ki-
netics were not rigorously measured and the reducibility
was inferred solely from the temperature of one or more
of the observed reduction peaks. These reduction peaks
reﬂect the structural transformation of the starting high-
valent oxides into structurally distinct suboxides, instead of
merely the ease of removal of the few oxygen atoms (<5%)
generally missing during steady-state ODH reactions
(9–11).
Next, we report the reduction kinetics of VOx and MoOx
catalysts measured during the initial stages of reduction
in H2. Figure 2 shows H2 consumption rates as a func-
tion of temperature during the reduction of VOx/Al2O3
and MoOx/Al2O3. Figure 2 shows that the reduction peak
maxima shift to lower temperature as the surface density
of the active oxides increases in VOx and MoOx samples.
This peak temperature occurs, however, at an extent of re-
duction requiring signiﬁcant restructuring to form distinct
suboxides, as detected by evolution of X-ray diffraction and
absorption features from those of MoO3 to MoO2 and ulti-
mately to Mo metal as reduction proceeds. Figure 3 shows
H2 consumption rates at 673 K (obtained using the method
described in the experimental section) as a function of MOx
surface density. H2 reduction rates are reported at 673 K
because this temperature leads to low extents of reduction
(5–10% of total V5+ or Mo6+), which resemble the antici-

MOx surface density (Fig. 3), in parallel with the observed
increase in ODH turnover rates (Fig. 1).
Figure 4 shows propane ODH turnover rates and initial
rates of reduction in H2 (from the data in Fig. 3) for VOx and
MoOx domains supported on alumina. A parallel increase
in these rates is apparent for each active oxide, but ODH
turnover rates on VOx catalysts are signiﬁcantly higher than
on MoOx catalysts, even at similar values of the measured
H2 reduction rates. This suggests that differences in struc-
tural or chemical properties of VOx and MoOx domains are

“felt” differently by the two reactions, and that their corre-
lation is incomplete without the detection and assessment
of such differences. Clearly, the structural and chemical re-
quirementsforODHandH2 reductionprocessesareshared
only to some extent. The rate of reduction in H2 may well
be appropriate as a complete description of the processes
required for a propane turnover for a given metal oxide, as
suggested by the data in Fig. 3, but additional factors must
be considered as the identity of the active oxides changes.
Yet, many studies have proposed a persistent correlation
between propane reactivity and reducibility in H2 (16–21),
without including the subtleties described above and with-
out reporting turnover rates (per exposed MOx) or initial
(low conversion) reduction rates in H2. Next, we show that
a more fundamental relationship appears to exist between
the rate of propane turnover and the ligand-to-metal elec-
tron transfer processes responsible for the near-edge region
absorption features in the electronic spectra of dispersed
metal oxides.
Diffuse reﬂectance UV–visible spectra were measured
for VOx, MoOx, NbOx, and WOx domains supported on
Al2O3 at varying MOx surface densities. These electronic
spectra reﬂect the structure of valence and conduction
bands in bulk solids and of the frontier atomic orbitals in
oxide domains too small to be described by a continuum
spectrum of energy states. In both bulk and dispersed ox-
ides, the bands arising from electronic transitions in the vis-
ible and UV energy range are typically broad, making their
interpretation and assignment to speciﬁc structures difﬁ-
cult. The absorption edge energy, however, can be mea-
sured rigorously, and it provides an accurate description
of the electronic properties of metal oxides (30), because
it corresponds to incipient ligand-to-metal charge transfer
processes in these materials.
Absorption edge energies were calculated using Tauc’s
law (25, 31). The absorption edge is deﬁned by conven-
tion as the x-intercept of a linearized near-edge region
for [F(R∞)hν]1/2 as a function of hν, where F(R∞) is the
Kubelka–Munk function [28] and hν is the energy of the in-
cident photon. This form accurately describes the near-edge
region for indirect band gap semiconductors and for amor-
phous semiconductors, such as those consisting of small ox-
ide domains, irrespective of the charge-transfer mechanism.
The absorption-edge energies estimated in this manner for
all Al2O3-supported VOx and MoOx catalysts are shown
in Fig. 5. Figure 5 shows that absorption-edge energies de-
crease with increasing VOx or MoOx surface density, sug-
gesting that the energy required to promote an electron
from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in a
lattice oxygen atom to the lowest unoccupied molecular or-
bital (LUMO) in the metal cation decreases as the surface
density and the size of the two-dimensional active oxide
domains increase. These results are consistent with simi-
lar trends reported earlier for dispersed MoOx and WOx

absorption energies are signiﬁcantly higher for MoOx than
for VOx samples. Next, we examine a possible relation be-
tween the ability of these materials to undergo oxygen-to-
metal electronic transitions and their effectiveness in form-
ing vacancies during propane ODH and during reduction
with H2.

and NbOx domains supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, or MgO.
Turnover rates increase monotonically with decreasing
absorption-edge energy, almost irrespective of the chem-
ical identity of the active oxide. The turnover rates for
propane conversion shown in Fig. 6 include both primary
propane oxidative dehydrogenation and primary propane
combustion reactions. On these materials, initial propene
selectivities are very high (>80%); therefore, the trends de-
tected in Fig. 6 for total propane conversion persist when
propene formation rates are used instead (Fig. 7). As in
the case of total rates, propene formation rates increase as
the absorption-edge energies of the active oxide domains
decrease. The observed correlation suggests that electron
promotion processes responsible for the absorption edge
involved in the kinetically relevant C–H bond activation
share some common requirements with the photoexcita-
tion process responsible for the absorption edge in all oxide
domains examined (VOx, MoOx, NbOx, and WOx).
A discussion of these common features requires that we
examine the details of propane ODH reactions on these ac-
tive oxides. Propane turnover rates on VOx and MoOx do-
mains are controlled by the dissociation of the ﬁrst methy-
lene C–H bond in propane. The transition state for this
elementary step lies along a reaction coordinate in which
two electrons are transferred from lattice oxygens to metal
centers as an isopropoxide and a hydroxyl group form from
propane (9–11). A plausible sequence, supported by molec-
ular simulations (32) and consistent with kinetic and iso-
topic tracer measurements (9, 33), is shown in Fig. 8. The

methylene C–H bond in a propane molecule ﬁrst interacts
with lattice oxygen as a propane molecule adsorbs weakly
on the oxide surface. The adsorbed propane reacts with a
vicinal lattice oxygen atom to form an isopropoxide species
and an OH group. The complete sequence of elementary
steps required for an oxidative dehydrogenation turnover,
conﬁrmed previously by kinetic and isotopic tracer stud-
ies (9, 11), is shown in Fig. 9, where k j denotes rate con-
stants for irreversible steps and K j equilibrium constants
for quasiequilibrated steps.
Two lattice oxygen atoms ultimately become involved in
the C–H activation step, and each one returns one electron
to either a single metal center, leading to a two-electron
reduction (e.g., V5+ to V3+), or to two metal centers, each
of which undergoes a one-electron reduction (e.g., V+5 to
V+4). These two processes require different energies, and
the reaction will preferentially follow the path with the
lower activation barrier. Molecular simulations (32) suggest
that propane ODH reactions involve one-electron reduc-
tion of two V+5 centers to V+4 using one electron from each
of two lattice oxygens, a process that requires a lower activa-
tion energy than a V5+- to-V3+ reduction. The need for two
V atoms to accommodate the transition state and the pro-
ducts in the rate-determining step may account for the
low ODH turnover rates observed on small oxide domains
(12, 13), such as monovanadate structures, which must
undergo less favorable two-electron reduction of individ-
ual V atoms during each ODH catalytic turnover. Two or

more adjacent V and Mo sites appear to be required for
other catalytic oxidation reactions (34, 35), and a sharp
break in catalytic behavior is reported between monomer
and oligomers of metal oxides. In the present study, the
changes in catalytic behavior are much more gradual
(12–15), because these samples do not exhibit sharp tran-
sitions in structure (e.g., from monovanadate to polyvana-
date) with increasing surface density of the active oxide.
The transition state for propane activation during ODH
reactions contains incipiently cleaved C–H and V–O bonds
and partially formed O–C and O–H bonds. (Figs. 8 and 9)
Molecular simulations and the empirical correlation be-
tween the rates of H2 reduction and propane ODH both
suggest that the required transition states for both pro-
cesses involve electron transfer from lattice oxygen atoms
to metal centers. The number of electrons transferred in
the process of forming this activated complex must lie bet-
ween zero (as in the reactants) and two (as in the pro-
ducts), because this elementary step lies along a reaction
coordinate in which two V–O bonds are cleaved and O–C
and O–H bonds are concurrently formed. Hammond’s pos-
tulate states that transition states become increasingly pro-
ductlikeasanelementarystepbecomeslessthermodynami-
cally favorable. Therefore, as the breaking of metal–oxygen
bonds becomes more difﬁcult (e.g., as the cation changes
from V to Mo to Nb), the reduced character of the cations
in the transition state should increase, and the energy of for-
mation of the transition state will respond more sensitively
to the ability of each cation to accept electrons. In other
words, as the energetics of the C–H bond activation state
become less favorable, the activated complex increasingly
resembles the reaction products. The stability of this transi-
tion state, and therefore the activation energy for C–H bond
activation steps, depends on the energy required to transfer
the required electrons from the oxygen ligands to the metal
centers in a metal oxide. This energy determines also, in the
case of excitation by photons, the energy at which absorp-
tion occurs in the UV–visible spectrum. As these electronic
transitions require higher energies, either because of a de-
crease in oxide domain size or a change in the chemical
identity of the oxide, propane ODH turnover rates concur-
rently decrease, as shown by the data presented in Figs. 6
and 7.
If all metal oxides shown in Figs. 6 and 7 followed the one-
electron reduction path suggested for VOx, a single general
correlation would be expected. This is not supported by
the data in Figs. 6 and 7. For all oxides, propane conver-
sion turnover rates increase monotonically with decreasing
absorption-edge energy, but the data for the different ox-
ides are shifted slightly relative to each other. Also, the
sensitivity of the rates to the absorption energy is weaker
for VOx domains than for MoOx domains. Of course, the
transition state structures suggested by the scheme in Fig. 8
include not only partially cleaved metal–oxygen bonds, but
also the incipient formation of M–O–C and M–O–H bonds.
The extent to which this evolution of chemical bonds has
progressed at the point of maximum energy along the re-
action coordinate (i.e., at the transition state) will depend
on the relative energies of these various bonds and on
whether the process involves one- or two-electron reduc-
tion of metal centers. Thus, although the edge energy is
important for these materials to stabilize the required acti-
vated complexes, the extent to which it inﬂuences these re-
action rates varies slightly as we change the identity of the
metal oxide and the consequent ﬁner details of the electron
transfer processes involved.
As a comparison, Fig. 10 shows the relationship between
H2 reduction rates (in a logarithmic axis) and UV–visible
absorption-edge energies for some VOx and MoOx samples
supported on Al2O3 and ZrO2. A decrease in absorption-
edge energy leads to an increase in H2 rates for VOx and
MoOx supported on Al2O3 with varying surface density
and domain sizes, but no clear general relationship emerges
from the complete set of data shown in Fig. 10. These
ﬁndings are in contrast to the more consistent relation
found between ODH turnover rates and absorption ener-
gies. Clearly, the marked differences in structural or chemi-
cal properties of VOx and MoOx domains are “felt” differ-
ently by H2 reduction and propane ODH reactions. While
ODH reaction pathways are relatively well established (9–
11), detailed H2 reduction mechanisms remain unclear (22)
and they emphasize the nucleation and growth processes
that limit stoichiometric reductions leading to changes in
crystal structure and not the chemistry of the H–H bond

activation and OH formation steps. In fact, one of the pos-
sible H2 reduction pathways on transition metal oxides may
include H2 dissociation on a few active metal centers and
hydrogen spillover to vicinal reducible oxides (22, 23), ren-
dering this H2 reduction process mechanistically unrelated
to the redox cycles required for alkane ODH (9–11). Thus,
the relationship between the tendency of oxides to reduce
in H2 and their ability to undergo fast redox cycles during
ODH reactions remains tenuous. It is clearly less appropri-
ate as a predictive tool as the identity of the oxide varies
than as changes in the size and structure of domains occur
for a given metal oxide.
CONCLUSION
Turnover rates for propane oxidative dehydrogenation
increase in parallel with an increase in the rate of H2 reduc-
tion and with a decrease in the UV–visible absorption-edge
energies for supported two-dimensional transition metal
oxides (VOx, MoOx, WOx, and NbOx). For a given metal
oxide, propane conversion turnover rates increase as the
rate of reduction in H2 increases, suggesting the involve-
ment of redox cycles in propane ODH kinetically rele-
vant steps. For samples with similar H2 reduction rates,
V-based catalysts are much more active than Mo-based
catalysts. Irrespective of the nature of the active oxide,
propane turnover rates increase monotonically as the UV–
visible absorption-edge energy decreases for all samples
examined. For each of the oxides examined (VOx, MoOx,
NbOx, and WOx) lower absorption energies correspond
to higher propane turnover rates. These results combined
with an analysis of the catalyst electron-transfer mecha-
nism suggest that C–H bond dissociation proceeds via tran-
sition states requiring electron transfer from oxygen atoms
to metal centers. The activation energy for this step ap-
pears to depend sensitively on energy required for elec-
tronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge in
the UV–visible spectrum. As this transition occurs at lower
energies, propane ODH turnover rates increase.
