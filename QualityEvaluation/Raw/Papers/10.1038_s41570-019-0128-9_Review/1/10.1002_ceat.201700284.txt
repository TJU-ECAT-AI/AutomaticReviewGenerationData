Abstract:  
A series of V-MCM-41 were in situ synthesized. The textual properties and vanadium species were 
systematically characterized. The results showed that the catalysts could still maintain mesoporous structure 
and high specific surface area. The vanadium species were highly dispersed on the surface while polymeric 
vanadium species co-existed. The iso-butane dehydrogenation was performed by employing CO2 as soft 
oxidant. The results revealed an almost linear relationship between the activity and surface vanadium sites. 
Isolated vanadium species were more active for iso-butane dehydrogenation. The iso-butane dehydrogenation 
reaction in the presence of CO2 could proceed simultaneously via oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative 
dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction.

1. Introduction 
Butene production from butane dehydrogenation is an important aspect of comprehensive utilization 
of light alkanes.1-3 With the increasing demand of butene derived products from the worldwide 
market, butene production from butane dehydrogenation process had received much more 
attention. Besides Pt- or Cr-based catalysts used in the industry (c.a. Oleflex and Catofin), researchers 
have always been seeking for an alternative with low operation temperature and running cost.4-6 
Vanadium based catalysts were investigated pervasively as a promising catalysts for dehydrogenation 
due to the relatively low price and environmental friendliness.7 After the successful synthesis of 
ordered mesoporous materials in 1990’s, the research on vanadium based catalyst was further 
promoted and developed. Many researches were focused on improving the activity, selectivity and 
stability of vanadium containing mesoporous materials since then. 
Vanadium containing mesoporous siliceous catalysts were demonstrated to be active for oxidative 
dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.8-12 It is widely acknowledged that the catalytic performance of the 
vanadium based catalyst was largely determined by the valance state and form of the vanadium 
species13-15. Bulánek reported that the side reaction was rather severe over V2O5 particles in oxidative 
reaction of n-butane.16 Al-Ghamdi summarized that VOx coverage in the sub-monolayer region was 
more favored for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.17 Zhang pointed out that monomeric 
tetrahedral coordinated vanadium species were active for propane and iso-butane dehydrogenation 
reaction.18 The valance state of vanadium species was also deemed as a key point for the oxidative 
dehydrogenation process. Many researchers had proved that V3+ showed a close relationship with 
the catalysts activity.19 
To increase the catalytic performance, much researches has been conducted to improve the 
dispersion of vanadium species.20-24 Among those were the in situ synthesis of vanadium based 
mesoporous catalysts. Compared with the traditional impregnation method, vanadium species were 
more evenly distributed and less likely to aggregate on catalysts derived from in situ synthesized 
method. In this paper, we employed methanol as a medium to combine organic vanadium precursor 
with silica source. The structure properties and vanadium species were carefully investigated. To 
overcome deep oxidation reaction, dehydrogenation performance of iso-butane of the catalysts 
were tested by employing CO2 as soft oxidant. 
2. Experimental 
2.1 Catalysts preparation 
The vanadium containing MCM-41 was synthesized by using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, A.R., 
Sinopharm) as silicon source and vanadyl (IV) acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2, A.R., Energy Chemical) as 
vanadium source. The preparation process was based on literature 25 with some modifications. 
Typically, 12.5 g of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB, A.R., Sinopharm product) and 75.0 g of 
ammonia solution (25%, A.R., Beijing Chemical Works) were added to 200.0 g of deionized water and 
stirred thoroughly until a clear solution was obtained, denoted as solution A. Certain amount of 
VO(acac)2 was added to 300.0 g methanol followed by mixing with 60.0 g TEOS, denoted as solution 
B. Then solution B was added to solution A dropwise under vigorous stirring. Hereafter, the mixture 
was transferred to Teflon-lined autoclaves and crystallized at 120 ºC for 48 h. The solid was filtered 
and washed with copious amount of water until the filtrate showed a neutral pH value. The materials 
were then dried at 120 ºC for 10h and calcined at 550 ºC for 6 hours with a heating ramp of 1 K∙min-1 
to remove all the surfactants. Finally, the powder was pressurized and pelletized to 30-40 mesh 
particles.

2.2 Catalysts characterization 
XRD patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer provided with Ni filtered 
Cu-Kα (λ=0.15416 nm) radiation at 40kV and 30mA. The scanning speed was 5 º∙min-1 in the range of 
1.3-50 º. 
N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were performed on an ASAP 2020 (Micromerities) instrument. 
The catalysts samples were pretreated at 90 ºC for 1 hour and degassed at 5.7∙102 Pa, 350 ºC for 5 
hours. The specific surface area was determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and 
the pore volume and pore size distribution were derived from the desorption isotherms using the 
Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. 
The vanadium content of the calcined catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma 
optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Perkin Elmer Optima 7300V). The catalysts were dissolved in 
the mixture of equivalent volume of concentrated HF and HNO3 solution before test. 
H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed on an Autochem 2920 
(Micromerities) in the range of 100-800 ºC. Samples (100 mg) were first treated in dry air at 500 ºC 
for 1 h then cooled down to ambient temperature in N2 atmosphere before being reduced in a flow 
of H2/Ar (10%H2 and a total flow of 50 ml∙min-1). The samples were heated up to 800 ºC at a rate of 
10 K∙min-1 and the effluent were monitored by a TCD and a MS detector. 
X-Ray Photoelectron spectrum (XPS) were recorded with a K-Alpha (Thermo Fisher) instrument 
equipped with a multichannel hemispherical electron analyzer, using Al Kα as the exciting radiation 
at constant pass energy of 149.8 eV. The pressure in the chamber was maintained bellowed 5.0×10-7 
Pa and the charge compensation was done with the adventitious C1s peak at 284.6 eV. 
The amount of vanadium sites were determined by O2 chemisorption as described by Oyama.26 The 
schematic diagram of the apparatus was shown in Figure S1 in Support Information. In a typical 
experiment, 200 mg catalyst was first reduced at 350 ºC (to avoid over reduction of bulk vanadium 
oxides) for 10 minutes by 10% H2/Ar gaseous mixture with a heating ramp of 5 K∙min-1. Then the gas 
was changed to pure Ar and kept at 350 ºC. Small amounts of O2 (10.291 μmole) was pulsed into the 
system by a six-way valve and repeated every 60s until the on-line Pfeiffer Prisma Plus (QMG 220) 
Mass Spectrometry Detector recorded a constant area. The amount of active sites was calculated 
based on O2 uptake derived from total area difference between the saturation peak and the prior 
unsaturated ones (assuming Vsurf = Oads). 
The diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of the samples were recorded on a Hitachi U-4100 
spectrometer equipped with a diffuse-reflectance attachment under ambient conditions. The 
powdery samples were loaded in a quartz cell, and the spectra were collected in 200-800 nm with a 
reference of BaSO4. The samples were dehydrated at 350 ºC for 8 h before test. 
The Raman spectra of the samples were collected from a Horiba LabRAM HR800 spectrometer 
system under ambient temperature. The powdery samples were put on a quartz glass slide for 
testing after dehydrated at 350 ºC for 8 h in dry air. The spectra were obtained with ultraviolet laser 
excitation at 325.07 nm in the range of 100-2800 cm-1. The scattered photons were directed to pass 
through the notch filter and grating (2400 gr∙mm-1) in the monochromator to remove the Rayleigh 
scattering. A UV-vis sensitive LN2-cooled CCD detector (Horiba Jobin Yvon CCD-3000V) was used to 
collect the scattered photons. The spectral resolution is 1 cm-1.  
TEM images were collected with a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 transmission electron microscopy operating at 
200 kV.

2.3 Catalysts tests 
The iso-butane dehydrogenation with CO2 were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor made of stainless 
steel (length: 55 cm, inner diameter: 10 mm) at atmospheric pressure. All samples were not reduced 
before the reaction. In a typical experiment, 2.0 g catalyst (30-40 mesh) was installed in the 
isothermal region of the reactor and pretreated at 450ºC for 2h in nitrogen stream (60 ml∙min-1) prior 
to be heated up to reaction temperature with a constant heating ramp of 5 K∙min-1. Iso-butane and 
CO2 were introduced into the reactor through two MFC (mass flow controllers) to obtain a desired 
ratio. The catalytic performance test at varied temperatures began at 450 ºC and increased by 50 ºC 
every 2 h until 600 ºC. The reaction data were collected 1 h after the reactor reached the target 
temperature. The iso-butane to CO2 ratio was kept at 1:4 (total flowrate of 50 ml∙min-1) all the time. 
The on stream catalytic performances at individual temperatures were also performed under similar 
conditions. For the catalytic test with different CO2 to iso-butane ratio, the flowrate of iso-butane 
was kept at 10 ml∙min-1 while N2 was used to maintain a total flowrate of 50 ml∙min-1. 
The outlet gases were analyzed on-line by a gas chromatography equipped with a FID detector 
(Agilent GS-Alumina capillary column, 50m×0.53mm) for hydrocarbons and a TCD detector (TDX-01 
packed column, 2m×0.3mm) for CO, CH4 and CO2. The feed conversion and selectivity to products 
were calculated based on carbon balance (coke deposited omitted). The iso-butane and CO2 
conversion and selectivity to olefins were calculated according to Equation (1), (2) and (3) 
respectively.

3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Structure properties 
The XRD patterns of synthesized V-MCM-41 were shown in Fig.1. Three well-resolved peaks ascribed 
to (100), (110) and (200) of hexagonal mesoporous structures can be observed (Fig.1). This indicated 
that the MCM-41 structure was largely maintained and the vanadium introduction did not essentially 
change the MCM-41’s p6mm space group.27 With the increasing of vanadium content, the 
occurrence of reduction in (100) peaks suggested a decreased crystallinity as well as a deterioration 
of the long range ordered pore structure in the catalysts. Apart from the changes of peak intensity, 
the peak position of (100) slightly shifted to lower diffraction angle when the vanadium content 
increased from 0.9 to 3.7 wt%. In other words, the d spacing also slightly increased accompany with 
the increasing metal content. This was a direct evidence that the structure parameters were affected 
by the vanadium introduction. As for the large-angle XRD patterns, only a broad peak due to 
amorphous feature of the framework was observed. The absence of diffraction peaks characteristic 
for V2O5 phase maybe explained by a high dispersion of vanadium species on the surface. 
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the samples and the corresponding pore width 
distribution were illustrated in Fig.2. All samples exhibited isotherms of type-IV, which were typical 
for MCM-41s materials. The H1 hysteresis loops in the P/P0 range of 0.2-0.4 corresponding to 
capillary condensation were obvious, reflecting that uniform mesopores were obtained.28, 29 The 
pore-width distribution curves widened as the vanadium content increases, but were all 
concentrated in the range of 2.4-3.2 nm. More details about specific surface area, pore volumes and 
other parameters were listed in Table 1. The materials showed a reductive tendency in surface area 
and pore volume with increasing vanadium content. These outcomes agreed well with the XRD

results showed above, and indicated a reduction in the long-range orders. The average pore 
diameters of the samples were all around 2.7 nm. The microporous volume in the samples were 
always small when compared with the microporous ones, demonstrating that most of the mesopores 
were not blocked by the introduction of vanadium. It seems that the increase in vanadium content 
slightly decreased the surface area and pore volume but did not significantly alter the average pore 
diameter. 
The morphology of the mesopores was further characterized by TEM (Fig.3). All the samples showed 
highly ordered arrays of mesoporous channels. This revealed that the mesoporous structure was 
preserved after the introduction of the vanadium species. These observations were consistent with 
the results derived from XRD and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. 
3.2 Vanadium species in the catalysts 
The temperature-programmed reduction profiles of the samples were presented in Fig.4. It could be 
seen that all samples exhibited distinct reduction peaks from 350 to 700 ºC. Details about the 
reduction peaks were given in Table 2. The peak temperature shifted from 446 to 462 ºC with 
increasing vanadium content. Besides, a shoulder peak at 550-600 ºC appeared and gradually 
became apparent. This indicated the high dispersion of the vanadium species and aggregation 
gradually happened in the high-loaded samples.30, 31 Bulánek and co-workers16, 32 attributed the low-
temperature reduction peak to the reduction of V5+ to V3+ in monomeric or highly dispersed 
vanadium species while the high-temperature reduction peak to the reduction of polymeric or bulk-
like V2O5 species.  
The number of surface vanadium sites were measured by O2 chemisorption. The curve of O2 uptake 
were displayed in Fig.5 and Fig.S2. The results of O2 chemisorption were given in Table 2. All the 
samples showed an “S-shape” curve and increased rapidly when approaching saturation. It was clear 
that total amount of O2 uptake increased with the increasing vanadium content, reaching a 
maximum over 4V-MCM-41. Then the amount of O2 uptake decreased when further increasing the 
vanadium content, indicating the slow aggregation of vanadium species in the high vanadium 
containing samples. This was consistent with the XRD and TPR results. 
Figure 6 showed the diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of V-MCM-41. All samples exhibited several 
broad absorption bands. The band at 270 nm should be ascribed to the low-energy charge transfer 
transitions between tetrahedral oxygen ligands and the V5+.33 The band at higher wavelength (from 
340 to 400 nm) should be assigned to the V-O charge transfer transitions in low-polymeric V5+ sites or 
micro-crystalline vanadium species.34, 35 This further proved the presence of polymeric or micro-
crystalline vanadium species, which was in agreement with the results of TPR profiles above. The 
positions of these bands also indicated that the coordination environment of V5+ was mainly 
tetrahedral. The band that arose from the d-d transition of V3+ and V4+ cation around 500 and 600 nm 
was not observed, which was a direct evidence of the absence of V3+ and V4+ species.36-39  
The calcined samples were investigated by XPS and the valence states of Si, O and V were 
summarized in Table 3. The peaks belonging to Si 2p were located in a narrow range from 103.4 to 
103.6 eV, which indicated the presence of SiO2-like structures in the samples. The O1s binding 
energies were between 532.6-532.8 eV, higher than that of O2-/V-O (530.0 eV) and lower than that of 
OH/Si-OH. This suggested that O1s signals were mainly derived from the O2-/Si-O in the framework of 
MCM-41. There might be certain amount of O2-/V-O and OH/Si-OH, but the signals were too weak to 
be told apart. The peak of V 2p3/2 were located around 517.2 eV, which should be ascribed to V5+ 
species on the surface.40 
The surface vanadium content determined by XPS were summarized in Table 3. Obviously, the 
vanadium content determined by XPS was different from the results of ICP-OES, and always less than 
the latter one. According to the results of Shylesh27, vanadium could incorporate into MCM-41 in two

ways: deep into the silica framework or on the wall surface. Table 3 indicated that most of the 
vanadium species were anchored on the walls while small amount of vanadium species incorporated 
into the framework of MCM-41. Interestingly, the difference value of vanadium content between the 
XPS and ICP-OES almost remained the same although the surface vanadium ratio increased with the 
vanadium loading amount. This was probably due to the limit of vanadium incorporation capacity to 
the framework. It seemed that vanadium species tend to incorporate into the framework firstly and 
then exist on the walls after the saturation.  
The vanadium species was further investigated by laser Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig.7, the 
Raman band at 1024 cm-1 which should attributed to the terminal V=O bond of surface highly 
dispersed vanadium species was detected in all samples.41, 42 No sharp signals at ca. 990 and 485 cm-1 
was identified in any of the samples, demonstrating that bulk-V2O5 were not formed.43, 44 The small 
shoulder peak at 990 cm-1 belonged to the V-O-V bond in polymeric or micro-crystalline vanadium 
species, suggesting that small amount of polymeric vanadium species were existed on samples with 
high metal loading (4V- and 5V-MCM-41)34, 45. This was in accordance with the conclusion derived 
from TPR profiles and UV-Vis spectra. 
3.3 Catalytic performance 
The iso-butane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 were explored at 450-600 ºC. The conversion 
of iso-butane and CO2 were shown in Figure 8. As can be seen clearly, the conversion of iso-butane 
and CO2 first increased almost linearly with the vanadium content and then declined on the 5V-
MCM-41sample at 450 and 500 ºC. This indicated that the conversion of iso-butane and CO2 were 
closely related with the surface vanadium sites rather than the overall metal loading. Therefore, the 
relationship between iso-butane conversion and surface vanadium sites was summarized in Figure 9. 
The conversion of iso-butane showed an almost linear relationship with the surface vanadium sites 
on samples without micro-crystalline vanadium species. The vanadium content of 5V-MCM-41 was 
1.36 times of that in 3V-MCM-41, but the surface vanadium sites of the two were nearly the same 
due to the existence of polymeric vanadium species. The conversion of iso-butane on 5V-MCM-41 
was lower than that on 3V-MCM-41, and the conversion gap became more apparent at higher 
reaction temperature. This proved that the polymeric vanadium species were unfavorable for CO2 
assisted dehydrogenation reaction. The conversions of iso-butane on 3V-MCM-41 were always 
higher than other samples in specified reaction temperature range of 550-600 ºC, suggesting that the 
polymeric vanadium species were even less active for iso-butane dehydrogenation reaction above 
550 ºC.  
The selectivity of iso-butene and CH4 were also illustrated in Figure 8. The selectivity of iso-butene 
was always high over catalysts with lower metal loading. Unlike the typical selectivity-conversion 
dependence in iso-butane dehydrogenation reactions, the selectivity of iso-butene showed a distinct 
decreasing trend on samples with polymeric vanadium species. This further confirmed that mono-
dispersed vanadium species were the active sites and polymeric vanadium species were not 
favorable for ODH reaction. Both the conversion and selectivity decreased on samples with polymeric 
vanadium samples. The selectivity of CH4 increased dramatically at 600 ºC. This was due to more iso-
butane was activated and the reaction rate of cracking was facilitated at high temperature. 
The yield of iso-butene was given in Figure S3. The yield showed the same trend with conversion of 
iso-butane. The relative maximum of yield of iso-butene could be obtained on 4V-MCM-41 at 450 
and 500 ºC and on 3V-MCM-41 at 550 and 600 ºC. The highest yield of iso-butene was 47.8% on 3V-
MCM-41 at 600 ºC. 
Figure S4-S7 showed the on-stream catalytic performance results over 3V-MCM-41 catalyst. Like 
other typical dehydrogenation catalysts, the conversion of iso-butane and CO2 decreased with the 
reaction time while the selectivity of iso-butene slightly increased due to the gradually deactivation

of the catalysts. As shown above, these became more apparently when the reaction temperature 
was 600 ºC as side reactions of coking and cracking became more severe. 
The results of iso-butane dehydrogenation with different CO2 to iso-butane ratio over 3V-MCM-41 
were shown in Figure 10. Obviously, the catalyst was active for iso-butane dehydrogenation even 
without the presence of CO2. The conversion of iso-butane increased with the content of CO2 in the 
feedstock both at 500 and 550 ºC while the conversion of CO2 decreased. The selectivity to CH4 
decreased with the increasing amount of CO2, suggesting that the cracking reaction was restrained by 
the addition of CO2. Besides, the addition of CO2 could effectively enhance the selectivity of C4 
olefins for iso-butane dehydrogenation reaction. Previously, Ascoop proved that the propane 
dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 could proceed simultaneously via oxidative dehydrogenation 
and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction. The results 
above also suggested that the iso-butane dehydrogenation followed an oxidative as well as a non-
oxidative route over vanadium based catalysts, which was in consistence with the conclusion derived 
from CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation. Accordingly, CO2 participate in the dehydrogenation 
reaction of iso-butane in two ways: (1) reoxidize the vanadium species as oxidant and (2) reduce the 
carbon formation by water gas shift reaction. This also explained the increase of iso-butene 
selectivity in the reaction. 
4. Conclusion 
A series of V-MCM-41 catalysts were synthesized hydrothermally by mixing the organic vanadium 
precursor with TEOS via methanol. The structure properties and vanadium species existed in the 
catalysts were systematically studied. The V-MCM-41 catalysts still maintained hexagonal 
mesoporous structure after the introduction of vanadium, while increasing vanadium content slightly 
decreased the specific surface area and pore volume. The vanadium species were highly dispersed in 
the catalysts, although characterization results showed that the isolated and polymeric vanadium 
species were co-existed on samples with high vanadium loading. The number of surface vanadium 
first increased with the vanadium content and then declined, reaching the highest of 0.28 V∙nm-2 on 
4V-MCM-41.  
The catalysts showed high performance for ODH reaction of iso-butane. The activity of the catalysts 
showed a linear relationship with surface vanadium sites on samples without polymeric vanadium 
species. The isolated vanadium species were more active for iso-butane dehydrogenation while the 
polymeric vanadium species would result in side reaction of cracking. The iso-butane 
dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of CO2 could proceed simultaneously via oxidative 
dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift 
reaction. The highest yield of iso-butene (47.8%) could be obtained on 3V-MCM-41 at 600 ºC.

TOC 
Type of Article: A series 
of V-MCM-41 catalysts 
were in situ synthesized. 
The catalysts still 
maintain hexagonal 
mesoporous structure 
and high specific surface 
area. The vanadium 
species were mostly 
dispersed isolated on 
the surface. The 
catalysts showed high 
performance for iso-
butane 
dehydrogenation. 
Isolated vanadium 
species were proved to 
be more active for iso-
butane 
dehydrogenation.
