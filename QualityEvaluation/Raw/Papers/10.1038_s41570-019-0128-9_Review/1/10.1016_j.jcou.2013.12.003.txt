1. Introduction
Among the greenhouse gases, CO2 is the prime gas responsible
for the enhanced greenhouse effect and accounts for 70% [1]. The
atmospheric CO2 has ampliﬁed by one-third since the inception of
the industrial revolution, which is further predicted to be
570 ppm by the end of this century [2,3]. There is an appreciable
correlation between greenhouse gas emissions and global temper-
ature trends. As a result, chemical ﬁxation of CO2 into value-added
compounds is an important strategy for mitigation of CO2 and also
a topic of huge interest in terms of ‘‘green and sustainable
chemistry’’ [1,4]. Mitigation of CO2 can play a pivotal role in
combating the greenhouse effect and global warming. Even though
CO2 is an economical, safe, and renewable C1 feedstock, but its
utilization as a chemical feedstock is limited due to its high
thermodynamic stability. Consequently, large amounts of energy
and/or high energy substrates are typically required to transform
the CO2 into chemicals [5–7]. Hydrogen is a high energy gas and
can be used for CO2 transformation as a reagent. CO2 acts as a
hydrogen acceptor (soft oxidant) in oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH) of alkanes to shift the reaction equilibrium toward oleﬁn
side. It also offers several pronounced advantages to overcome
deep oxidation, low product selectivity, and the formation of
greenhouse gas CO2 as a byproduct, which are usually encountered
in the conventional processes [8,9]. In addition, the ODH with CO2
has also been considered as a potential way to lessen the negative
impact of dangerous oxidant-parafﬁn mixture [10].
Production of oleﬁns from their respective hydrocarbons is an
industrially important reaction. The 1,3-butadiene is a versatile
monomer used for synthesis of polymers, synthetic rubbers,
plastics with special mechanical properties, and also as a raw
material for a variety of chemicals synthesis [11]. Recently, a few
studies have been reported in the literature for the production of
butenes through the ODH of n-butane (nB) with CO2 [12–16]. Ge
et al. have investigated the inﬂuence of CO2 in the ODH of nB with
oxygen over V–Mg–O catalyst [14]. It was found that an increase in
CO2 partial pressure improves the selectivity and yield of C4
dehydrogenation products. But, a clear decrease in the catalytic
activity with CO2 alone as the oxidant was reported. A decrease in
the catalytic activity with CO2 (absence of oxygen) was also noted
over TiP2O7 catalysts [15]. The poor performance of the catalysts in
the presence of CO2 could be due to the lack of reoxidation
efﬁciency of the catalyst surface or strong adsorption of CO2 on the
catalyst surface [14,15]. Interestingly, promoting effect of CO2 on

The CO2 promoted oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane was investigated over mixed metal
oxide supported vanadium catalysts. The investigated mixed metal oxide supports namely, CeO2–ZrO2
(CZ) and TiO2–ZrO2 (TZ) were synthesized by coprecipitation method, and the vanadium oxide was
deposited on the supports by wet impregnation method. The synthesized samples were characterized by
BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The XRD analysis of CZ and CZ supported V2O5 samples
revealed the formation of CexZr1xO2 solid solution and a highly dispersed vanadium oxide over the CZ
support, respectively. On the other hand, different mixed oxide phases (ZrV2O7 and TiZrO4) were
observed in the case of TZ supported vanadia catalyst. The TPR reduction temperature of supported
samples is lower than the bulk V2O5. XPS results revealed that vanadium and cerium are in V5+ and Ce4+/
Ce3+ oxidation states, respectively. Among the investigated catalysts, the CZ supported vanadium oxide
catalyst exhibited a high activity and good time-on-stream stability. The redox property of the catalyst
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the catalytic activity in the ODH of n-butane with CO2.

nB conversion was observed over Cr2O3 and V2O5 supported-
oxidized diamond catalysts compared to simple dehydrogenation
with Ar [13]. In our previous reports [12,17], a signiﬁcantly high nB
conversion and C4 oleﬁns (1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene,
and 1,3-butadiene) selectivity were noted in the ODH of nB with CO2
as compared to dehydrogenation of nB with N2 over mixed metal
oxide supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Furthermore, the
vanadium oxide supported on mixed metal oxides also exhibited
high catalytic activity compared to its individual oxides supported
vanadia catalysts. The high activity of mixed oxide supported
vanadia catalysts is mainly due to superior acid–base bifunctionality
and reducibility of the dispersed vanadium oxide [12]. The existence
of synergetic effect in mixed oxide materials plays an important role
in enhancing the catalytic activity [12,18]. However, catalytic
performance of supported vanadium oxide is strongly inﬂuenced by
the speciﬁc oxide employed as the support [19–22].
TiO2–ZrO2 mixed oxide has received a tremendous attention
recently as active catalyst and catalyst support for a wide variety of
reactions owing to its signiﬁcant features that include high speciﬁc
surface area, profound acid–base properties, high thermal stability,
and strong mechanical strength [23]. Ceria-based mixed oxides are
also receiving much attention as catalysts, supports, and promo-
ters due to their high oxygen-storage capacity (OSC) and facile
oxidation/reduction of the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple. Ceria-based
mixed oxides are active catalysts for oxidation of various
compounds such as hydrocarbons, soot, and CO [24–26]. The
presence of CeO2 promotes various catalytic reactions namely, CO2
activation [27], low-temperature water–gas shift reaction [28],
and so on. The unique oxygen storage/release capacity and redox
properties of CeO2 are known to suppress the deactivation of the
catalysts under rigorous reaction conditions. The CeO2–V2O5
combination catalyst also showed a remarkably high activity
and stability for ODH of aromatic hydrocarbons with CO2 [29].
In the present study, the oxidizing ability of V2O5 has been
exploited by supporting it on the redox featured CeO2–ZrO2 and
TiO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides. These supports were synthesized through
a soft-chemical route by adopting a coprecipitation method, and
the V2O5 was deposited over the calcined support by a wet
impregnation method. The structural evolution of catalysts was
achieved by using BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD),
temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and X-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The catalytic performance was
evaluated for the ODH of nB to C4 oleﬁns in the vapor phase under
normal atmospheric pressure employing CO2 as the soft oxidant.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of catalysts
The MO2–ZrO2 (M = Ce (CZ) and Ti (TZ), 1:1 mol ratio) mixed
metal oxide supports were prepared by adopting a coprecipitation
method using dilute aqueous NH3 (DC Chemicals, Korea) as
precipitating reagent. For TZ support, requisite amount of TiCl4
(0.09 M TiCl4 in 20% cold HCl solution, Aldrich, USA) and ZrOCl2
(Aldrich, USA) were dissolved in deionized water to form
homogeneous aqueous mixed salt solution under mechanical
stirring. To this solution, dilute aqueous NH3 was added drop wise
with vigorous stirring until the precipitation was complete at room
temperature. The resultant precipitate was aged hydrothermally at
100 8C for 12 h. Thus formed white precipitate was then ﬁltered off,
washed several times with deionized water until free from anion
impurities. The obtained material was oven dried at 100 8C for 12 h
and ﬁnally calcined at 600 8C for 6 h in static air. The CZ support
was synthesized by using aqueous solution of ceric ammonium
nitrate (Aldrich) and ZrOCl2. The dilute ammonium hydroxide was
added drop wise to the mixed salt solution until the precipitation
was complete. The resulting aged precipitate was ﬁltered off and
washed with deionized water. Finally, the sample was oven dried
at 100 8C for 12 h, subsequently calcined at 600 8C for 6 h in static
air. On the calcined mixed metal oxide supports, V2O5 (12 wt.% on
CZ; VCZ and 15 wt.% on TZ; VTZ) was deposited by adopting a
standard wet impregnation method. In a typical procedure, the
desired quantity of ammonium metavanadate (Aldrich) was
dissolved in aqueous oxalic acid solution to form a clear solution
at room temperature. To this solution, ﬁnely powdered calcined
supports were added with continuous stirring. The excess of water
was evaporated on a hot plate under vigorous stirring. Finally,
materials were oven dried at 100 8C for 12 h and calcined at 600 8C
for 6 h in static air.
2.2. Characterization studies
BET speciﬁc surface areas were obtained on a TriStar 3000
(Micromeritics Instrument Co., USA) at liquid N2 temperature.
Prior to measurement, the samples were degassed at 300 8C for 3 h
to remove any residual moisture. The BET speciﬁc surface areas
were calculated from adsorption data in the relative pressure (P/Po)
range = 0.04–0.25. XRD patterns of the samples were obtained on a
Rigaku diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (l = 0.154 nm) source
and a Scintillation counter detector. The intensity data were
collected over a range of 58  2u  808 with a step size and time per
step were, respectively, ﬁxed at 0.028 and 1 s. Crystalline phases
were identiﬁed by comparison with the standard reference data
from International Center for Diffraction Data (ICDD) ﬁles. The TPR
measurements were carried out by using AutoChem II 2920
(Micromeritics Instrument Co., USA) instrument. In a typical
experiment, 100 mg catalyst sample was loaded in a U-shape
quartz reactor and pretreated in a ﬂow of helium gas at 300 8C for
1 h and allowed to cool. After this, the analysis was carried out by
using 4.95% H2 in helium gas and raising the temperature of the
sample from 50 to 700 8C at a heating rate of 10 8C min1. The XP
spectra of the samples were recorded on a Shimadzu (ESCA 3400)
spectrometer by using Mg Ka (1253.6 eV) radiation as the
excitation source. Charging of catalyst samples was corrected by
setting the binding energy of the adventitious carbon (C 1s) at
284.6 eV. The XPS analysis was done at ambient temperature and
pressures typically in the order of less than 106 Pa. Prior to
analysis, the samples were out-gassed in a vacuum oven overnight.
2.3. Catalytic performance
The catalytic activity for vapor phase ODH of nB with CO2 was
investigated in a down ﬂow ﬁxed-bed stainless steel microreactor
at normal atmospheric pressure. The catalyst was mixed with inert
quartz particles (50–70 mesh) with a catalyst to quartz ratio of 1:1
and placed in the isothermal middle part of the reactor, between
two ﬂocks of quartz wool. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was
preheated at 600 8C for 2 h in the ﬂow of He (25 mL min1). The
catalyst pretreatment was further continued another 30 min at the
same temperature in the ﬂow of CO2 (25 mL min1). Then nB was
introduced through a mass ﬂow controller into the reactor. The gas
hourly space velocity (GHSV) with respect to nB (600 mL h1 g1
cat) and nB to CO2 ratio (1:5) for all runs were kept constant. The
reaction products were analyzed by online chromatography
(Younlin Instrument, Acme 6000 Series, Korea) equipped with
thermal conductivity detector and ﬂame ionization detector. For
hydrocarbons analysis, 23% SP-1700 on 80/100 Chromosorb PAW
(6 ft  1/8 in.) column was employed and for CO, H2 and CO2,
Carbosphere (6 ft  1/8 in.) column was used. The main products
that were analyzed include 1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene,
1,3-butadiene, propane, ethane, methane, hydrogen, and carbon
monoxide.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. BET surface area studies
BET surface areas of CZ, TZ, VCZ, and VTZ samples are presented
in Table 1. The speciﬁc surface area of TZ and CZ mixed oxide
supports are 207 and 67 m2 g1, respectively [29]. Based on the
speciﬁc surface areas of the support, different loadings of vanadia
were selected to achieve the theoretical monolayer coverage over
the supports (12 wt.% on CZ and 15 wt.% on TZ) [30]. The vanadia
impregnated 
samples 
exhibited 
low 
surface 
area 
than 
the
supports. Among vanadia containing samples, the VTZ exhibited
high speciﬁc surface area than VCZ. However, the decline in the
speciﬁc surface area after impregnation with vanadia is generally
ascribed to various reasons such as, penetration of the deposited
active vanadium oxide species into the pores of the support,
narrowing pore diameter, blocking some of the pores, and solid-
state reactions between the dispersed active oxide and the
supporting oxide [11,17,30].
3.2. XRD studies
The XRD patterns of CZ, VCZ, and VTZ catalysts are shown in
Fig. 1. As shown in the ﬁgure, the CZ and VCZ samples exhibited
diffraction lines corresponding to a phase analogous to cubic
ﬂuorite type phase of ceria. Moreover, within the detection limits
of XRD technique, the diffraction lines pertaining to ZrO2
(monoclinic, tetragonal or cubic) phase were not found. It was
conﬁrmed from XRD analysis that the formation of CeO2–ZrO2
solid solutions with the cubic structure (Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, PDF-ICDD #
28-0271; Ce0.6Zr0.4O2, PDF-ICDD # 38-1439) [26,31]. Additionally,
the impregnated vanadium oxide improved the crystallinity of
various phases in the VCZ sample. Hence, it can be inferred from
XRD measurements that the dispersed vanadium oxide accelerates
the crystallization of CZ solid solution and incorporation of more
zirconium into the ceria lattice [31]. However, no crystalline phase
ascribed to vanadium oxide was found. Therefore, it can be
presumed that the dispersed vanadium oxide is in a highly
dispersed or amorphous state on the surface of the CZ support. The
TZ support exhibits diffraction lines corresponding to crystalline
ZrTiO4 phase when calcined beyond 450 8C [23]. In the case of VTZ
catalyst, the diffraction lines of mixed oxide phases, namely, ZrTiO4
and ZrV2O7 were mainly observed, while the peaks of TiO2
(2u = 27.5 and 35.78; rutile phase) other than those of single oxides
(monoclinic, tetragonal or cubic ZrO2 and V2O5) were detected in
the 2u range of 20–808. As envisaged earlier [32], the vanadium
oxide reacts preferably with the ZrO2 portion of the ZrTiO4
compound and forms ZrV2O7 with the liberation of TiO2. Thus
released portion of TiO2 appears as the crystalline rutile phase.
Generally, in mixed oxide supported vanadia catalysts, vanadium
containing new mixed oxide phase is normally observed at high
temperatures owing to vanadium oxide selective interaction with
one of the metal oxides of the mixed oxide support. However, in
case of VCZ sample such phase (CeVO4) was not witnessed. It could
be due to the presence of CeVO4 phase in amorphous state or small
particle size that was below the detection limit of the XRD
technique.
3.3. TPR studies
The reducibility of samples and interaction between the active
component and the supporting oxides were studied by H2-TPR. The
TPR proﬁles of CZ, VCZ, and VTZ samples are depicted in Fig. 2. As
shown in the ﬁgure, a major broad hydrogen consumption peak at
600 8C with a shoulder at low temperature was observed for CZ
support. Generally, ceria doped materials strongly favor the
reduction, ﬁrst by coordinately unsaturated surface capping
oxygen ions at low temperature followed by bulk oxygen [33].
The observed main and shoulder hydrogen consumption peaks of
CZ support are ascribed to surface and bulk reductions, respec-
tively [34]. The TZ support exhibits two peaks at high temperatures
(748 and 870 8C) [29]. The TPR results conﬁrm that TZ is quite
stable which is primarily due to the formation of an amorphous or
crystalline ZrTiO4 compound. The reduction of bulk V2O5 has been
reported between 531 and 1008 8C with multiple reduction peaks

owing to V2O5 ! V6O13 ! V2O4 ! V2O3 [29]. However, the reduc-
ibility of V2O5 is strongly inﬂuenced by the type and reducibility of
the oxide support employed [35]. In vanadia promoted catalysts,
the reducibility of vanadium oxide has been shifted to lower
temperatures in comparison to the bulk V2O5. Interestingly, in the
case of VCZ sample the intensity of main peak enhanced compared
to CZ support owing to ceria–vanadia mixed oxide phase. An
additional peak was noticed at 784 8C attributed to the reduction of
CeVO4 to CeVO3. The reduction of dispersed vanadium oxide over
the TZ support is expected to reduce at lower temperatures than
the bulk V2O5. The TPR analysis clearly exempliﬁed that the
reduction peaks of both vanadium oxide supported samples
reduced at lower temperatures compared to the bulk vanadium
oxide.
3.4. XPS studies
In order to understand the nature of interactions between the
supported oxide and the supporting oxides and the oxidation
states of the surface species, the synthesized samples have been
investigated by XPS technique. The representative photoelectron
peaks of V 2p pertaining to both VCZ and VTZ samples are
presented together in Fig. 3. The presence of peaks at a binding
energy (BE) of 517.2 and 517.0 eV for VCZ and VTZ samples,
respectively are attributed to V5+. Which indicate that the
vanadium oxide surface species are mostly in fully oxidized state
(V5+). It has been reported in the literature that the BE of V 2p3/2 for
V5+ oxidation state ranges between 517.4 and 516.4 eV [36,37]. The
presence of V5+ oxidation state in the VCZ sample is probably due
to the formation of CeVO4, in which vanadium cations are in +5
valent state [38]. In the case of VTZ sample, the crystalline ZrV2O7
compound stabilizes the +5 state of vanadium. The present results
are thus corroborating very well with the earlier ﬁndings [31,39].
As shown in Fig. 4, the Zr 3d photoelectron peaks of CZ, VCZ, and
VTZ samples are found at the BEs of 182.2, 183.2, and 182.5 eV,
respectively. After vanadium oxide loading, the Zr 3d BE of VCZ
sample increased to 1 eV higher than that of the support which is
in good agreement with the literature [31]. The high BE of Zr 3d in
VCZ sample signiﬁes the enrichment of zirconium and accounts for
the emergence of zirconia-rich composite oxide. The decrease in
the Ce/Zr ratio from 2.80 (CZ) to 2.49 (VCZ) also indicates the
enrichment of zirconium after the impregnation of vanadia [31].
The core level electron binding energies of Ti 2p and O 1s for
various samples are depicted in Table 1. The photoelectron signal
of Ti 2p is found at 458.5 eV ascribed to the spin orbital multiplets
of Ti 2p3/2 [40]. The BEs of both Zr 3d and Ti 3d reveals the presence
of +4 oxidation state for both Zr and Ti. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the
Ce 3d core level proﬁles are more complicated owing to complex
nature of the spectra arising not only because of multiple oxidation
states, but also due to ﬁnal state ‘‘shake down’’ which places a
different occupation in the O 2p and Ce 4f valance orbitals. The Ce
3d core level spectrum is composed of ﬁve spin-orbit doublets
owing to two multiplets, Ce 3d3/2 and Ce 3d5/2. The XPS bands
labeled u (main bands u0 and u, satellite bands u0, u00, and u000) and v
(main bands v and v0, satellite bands v0, v00, and v000) are ascribed to
Ce 3d3/2 and Ce 3d5/2 ionizations, respectively. The bands labeled v
and v00 have been related to a mixing of Ce 3d9 4f2 O 2p4 and Ce 3d9
4f1 O 2p5 Ce(IV) ﬁnal states, and the v000 corresponds to the ﬁnal
state of Ce 3d9 4f0 O 2p6 Ce(IV). While, v0 and v0 are due to Ce 3d9
4f2 O 2p5 and Ce 3d9 4f1 O 2p6 ﬁnal states corresponding to Ce3+.
The similar assignment can be applied to u structures, which
correspond to the Ce 3d3/2 levels [31,41]. It can be stated from the
results that both CZ and VCZ samples exhibit surface cerium
species in Ce+4 and Ce+3 oxidation states. The u000 peak is the most
convenient feature to identify the progress of Ce reduction, since it
does not overlap with any other peaks. A closer look at the ﬁgure
shows that a decrease in the intensity of the peak u000 and an
increase in the intensity of peaks u0/v0 and u0/v0 that are found after
dispersion of vanadium oxide on the CZ support. This signiﬁcant

observation manifests that there is an increase in the surface Ce3+
ions. It can be concluded from the XPS results that both CZ and VCZ
samples contain surface cerium species in both +4 and +3 oxidation
states and the Ce3+ species is predominant in the case of VCZ
sample that could be due to the formation of CeVO4.
3.5. Catalytic activity studies
In our previous study, ODH of nB with CO2 as the soft oxidant
was investigated over VOx/SnO2–ZrO2 catalyst and found that the
presence 
of 
vanadium 
oxide 
and 
the 
involvement 
of 
CO2
signiﬁcantly increase the activity [11]. Therefore, in the present
study, ODH of nB was carried out over VOx/MO2–ZrO2 (M = Ce and
Ti; VCZ and VTZ) samples employing CO2 as the soft oxidant at
600 8C and GHSV of 600 mL h1 g1 catalyst with respect to nB. The
nB conversion and the total C4 oleﬁns selectivity are presented in
Fig. 6. The conversion of nB over VTZ and VCZ samples was 39.8%
and 33.8% at 15 min, respectively. Both samples displayed a
decrease in the conversion of nB with reaction time and reached to
28.3% and 28.9% at 60 min, respectively. The rate of decrease in the
conversion over VCZ sample is much lower than that of the VTZ
catalyst. Regarding the total selectivity of C4 oleﬁns, a high
selectivity was observed over the VCZ sample. The selectivity of total
C4 oleﬁns was 50.2 and 25.8% at 15 min for both VCZ and VTZ
samples, respectively. Interestingly, rate of decrease in the
selectivity over VCZ sample is slower than that of VTZ sample.
The VCZ sample exhibited a total C4 oleﬁns selectivity of 45.5% at
60 min, which is higher than the initial selectivity (25.8%; at 15 min)
of VTZ. These results clearly manifest that vanadia supported on CZ
exhibits a high and stable catalytic activity for the title reaction in
comparison to the TZ supported vanadia catalyst.
The oxygen vacancies or lattice oxygen species generally
participate in the ODH of hydrocarbons over metal oxide catalysts
[42]. This reaction is believed to proceed via a Mars–van Krevelen
(redox)-type reaction mechanism [42]. In redox type mechanism,
the lattice oxygen of the catalyst participates in the dehydrogena-
tion process to produce respective oleﬁns along with the water,
where reduction of higher valence state metal oxide occurs to
lower oxidation state (Eq. (1)). Here the CO2 plays a critical role to
reoxidize the lower valence metal oxide (Eq. (2)). Under the CO2
ﬂow, both consumption of the lattice oxygen and reoxidation of the
vanished lattice oxygen proceeds simultaneously to provide H2O
(Fig. 7) [43]. Therefore, the redox cycle over vanadium oxide-
loaded catalysts is an important factor in promoting the catalytic
activity for ODH of nB with CO2 [43]. The CZ support is a well-
known material for its facile Ce4+/Ce3+ redox chemistry and oxygen
mobility [44]. The existence of Ce4+/Ce3+ was also conﬁrmed by
XPS. In the vanadia containing catalysts, the catalytic redox cycle is
facile which may be due to the redox cycle of the cerium sites near
the vanadium sites. It may vary for most of the supported-vanadia
catalysts that work on the redox cycle of vanadium sites [45]. It has
been reported in the literature that the key catalytic site in the ODH
of propane over ceria supported vanadia catalysts is V–O–V or V–
O–Ce bridging oxygen [45,46]. Martinez-Huerta et al. [45] have
reported that the nature of active sites in the case of ethane ODH
over the ceria-supported vanadia and CeVO4 catalysts is similar. It
implies that the activity for both the systems is comparable
because both have same active centers. The common functionality
in both the systems is V–O–Ce bond, which is involved in the rate-
determining step for ethane ODH [45]. The existence of CeVO4 was
conﬁrmed from XPS and TPR studies. Therefore, the catalyst with a
combination of vanadia and CZ is expected to exhibit better
catalytic activity compared to VTZ. However, further studies are
needed to conﬁrm the activity of VCeO4 and ZrV2O7 oxides.

The ODH of nB was also carried out over CZ and TZ supports at
600 8C and GHSV of 600 mL h1 g1 catalyst. As shown in Fig. 6, the
nB conversion and total C4 oleﬁns selectivity over CZ support is
7.4% and 20.9%, respectively at 15 min. But the support TZ showed
a poor activity (<3% conversion) at 15 min. After dispersion of
vanadium oxide on the CZ and TZ, the nB conversion and total C4
oleﬁns selectivity were signiﬁcantly enhanced. These results
obviously exemplify that vanadium oxide plays an important role
for ODH of nB with CO2 as the soft oxidant. Interestingly, the rate of
decrease in the conversion and selectivity in the case of CZ support
was almost similar to VCZ sample and lower in comparison to VTZ
sample. 
Moreover, 
the 
CZ 
support 
exhibited 
high 
activity
compared to TZ. These results clearly reveal that support plays a
critical role for the observed high and stable activity. This is mainly
due to the facile oxygen transport from the bulk of cerium oxide
solid solution that helps in the prevention of coke formation, which
is the main deactivation pathway of these catalysts [29].
The time-on-stream measurements are most signiﬁcant to
understand the behavior of various catalytic systems. Generally,
catalyst deactivation is often encountered in the ODH of alkanes.
Therefore, time-on-stream study was performed over VCZ catalyst
at 600 8C and GHSV of 600 mL h1 g1 catalyst. The nB conversion
and product distribution are shown in Fig. 8. The ﬁgure clearly
reveals that the VCZ catalyst shows a decline in the conversion of
nB and total C4 oleﬁns selectivity with reaction time. Interestingly,

a high selectivity of 1,3-butadiene was noticed at longer reaction
times. The selectivity of 1-butene is lower compared to 2-butenes
that means the ratio of 1-butene/2-butenes is less than one. The 1-
butene/2-butene ratio is 1 and <1 over the catalysts with acidic
and basic character on the surface, respectively [47]. The change in
the catalyst color and an increase in the weight of the catalyst were
observed after the experiment. It is mainly due to formation of coke
during the reaction. Coking may be responsible for decline in the
catalytic activity i.e. deactivation of the catalyst. Further studies are
necesaary to understand the mechanism of coking and deactiva-
tion of the catalysts.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, CeO2–ZrO2 (CZ) and TiO2–ZrO2 (TZ) mixed metal
oxide supports were prepared by coprecipitation method and
vanadium oxide was deposited on the calcined mixed oxide
supports by a wet impregnation method. The characterization
results suggested the formation of Ce–Zr solid solutions in the case
of CZ support and the CZ supported vanadium oxide (VCZ) catalysts
respectively. The deposited vanadium oxide is in a highly dispersed
form over the CZ support, whereas TZ supported vanadium oxide
(VTZ) catalyst exhibited the formation of new and stable ZrTiO4
and ZrV2O7 compounds. The mixed oxide supports facilitated easy
reduction of the vanadium oxide compared to its bulk form. The Ce
3d XPS results indicated the presence of both Ce4+ and Ce3+
oxidation states in CZ and VCZ samples, and the impregnated
vanadium is in +5 oxidation state. The ODH of n-butane with CO2
revealed that the reactivity of VCZ sample is much higher than
other samples. The presence of vanadium oxide is very important
to increase the activity and the support plays a vital role for stable
catalytic activity. The redox property of the catalyst signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced the catalytic activity for nB ODH with CO2.
