Abstract
The uniform monodispersed vanadium-doped three-dimensional dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (nV-MSNSs) were successfully synthesized in a heterogeneous oil–water biphase stratification reaction system and characterized by several state-of-the-art methods. The synthesized nV-MSNSs were applied to the oxidative dehydrogenation of the propane (ODHP) reaction with the presence of CO2 and exhibited excellent catalytic performances. The results show that the vanadium loading (1.3–8.0 wt %) evidently influences the textural properties, oxidation state, and polymerization degree of vanadium species of nV-MSNSs. The specific surface area (SBET), pore diameter (Dp), and pore volume (Vp) of nV-MSNSs decrease with the loading of vanadium species. The excessively high vanadium loading leads to the slight connection of nanospheres, but does not affect the assembly and growth of the three-dimensional (3D) dendritic channels. The percentage of highly dispersed vanadium VV species gradually increases and attains the maximum value for 5.2V-MSNSs with the loading of vanadium and then decreases with further vanadium addition. The higher-polymerized VOx species gradually generates above 5.2 wt % vanadium content for nV-MSNSs. The lower-polymerized VOx species appear to be more active than the higher-polymerized VOx species. Markedly, the 5.2V-MSNSs exhibit the highest catalytic activity with the initial propane conversion of 58% for the ODHP. The excellent catalytic performance can be maintained after eight reaction–regeneration cycles. The silica mesoporous frameworks can be well preserved in the reaction–regeneration cycles; meanwhile, the highly dispersed vanadium oxide also can be fully recovered after in situ regeneration. Hence, nV-MSNS catalysts exhibit outstanding activity and stability, and it would have a promising application in the DH of alkanes.

1 Introduction
In recent years, with the rapidly increasing demand for propylene, the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction of propane (ODHP) is considered to be a promising process alternative to steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes to produce propylene. (1-5) O2 and N2O are usually used as oxidants in the ODHP. For example, Kondratenko et al. reported that VOx/MCM-41 catalysts presented higher proplyene selectivity with N2O as compared to that with O2 at a similar propane conversion in the ODHP reaction. (6) However, the commercialization was hindered by the high cost of N2O. In contrast, using O2 as an oxidant may lead to a low propylene selectivity due to deep oxidation. (7) CO2 as a mild oxidant has received much attention recently in comparison to other oxidants for the ODHP reaction. Unlike O2, CO2 can effectively prevent the deep oxidation of products and improve the catalytic stability of catalysts. (8-10) In addition, the reaction coupling (the process of combining DH with the RWGS reaction) is an approach to improve the equilibrium conversion in the ODHP reaction. (11, 12) Moreover, utilizing and reducing CO2 is a meaningful way to realize a sustainable industry. (13, 14)
Various transition metal oxides (vanadium oxide, chromium oxide, indium oxide, gallium oxide, etc.) were catalytically active for the ODHP reaction. (15-18) Especially, the vanadium oxide catalysts have been widely studied for the ODHP reaction. (19, 20) For the VOx/SiO2 supported catalysts, it is well known that the surface structure of the supported metal oxide is crucial to the catalytic performance. Russell et al. first proposed the concept of monolayer coverage in 1946, (21) which represented the maximum amount of two-dimensional (2D) vanadium oxide species on a SiO2 support just before the formation of 3D V2O5 crystallites on the surface. The isolated monomeric O═V(O−)3 species together with dimeric and oligomeric species were present on SiO2 support surfaces below the monolayer coverage with low vanadium loading. (22) Sauer and co-workers investigated the reaction mechanism of the ODHP reaction upon VOx/SiO2 catalysts (23, 24) and found that the 2D vanadium (VV) oxide species were reduced to VIV or VIII by two hydrogen abstraction steps. The first hydrogen abstraction occurred on a vanadyl group (O═VV) and yielded a HO–VIV site. The second H abstraction could occur at the same site, yielding H2O·VIII, or at an “unreacted” O═VV site, yielding two HO–VIV species, and also occurred on V–O–Si bridging oxygen sites. As examined by the density functional theory (DFT), oligomeric vanadium oxide species still had the same reaction pathway and DH activity as the monomeric vanadium species. (24) Nevertheless, the polymeric vanadium oxide species similar to V2O5 crystallites led to a low yield of propylene. (25) Thus, to improve propylene productivity, the first priority is to maximize 2D dispersion of vanadium oxide species on the porous supports.
With the rapid development of nanotechnology, the novel nanostructured support materials have been subjected to extensive research. (26, 27) The porous nanomaterials show their superior advantages over others, because of the tunable pore size, large pore volume, and high surface area. (28, 29) Recently, the uses of vanadium-incorporated mesoporous silica materials for the selective oxidation of low alkanes have been frequently reported. (30, 31) They not only modified the material properties but also got high stability and reusability for the ODHP reaction. However, the conventional supported catalysts prepared with surfactants as templates, such as VOx/SBA-15, have extremely long isolated channels and inefficient mass-transports, resulting in low catalytic activities. (4, 32) Therefore, we should pick out short-range ordered mesoporous materials to improve the mass-transport of reactants and maximize the exposure of active vanadium species. The homogeneous monodispersed 3D dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (3D dendritic MSNSs) were synthesized with a tunable center-radial pore diameter and dendritic unique mesoporous channels. (33) The catalysts for loading palladium nanoparticles (NPs) in 3D dendritic MSNSs showed good catalytic performances. (34) Herein, with the goal of preparing a catalyst with highly dispersed vanadium species, we intend to synthesize uniform monodispersed vanadium-doped 3D dendritic MSNSs (nV-MSNSs) through an in situ growth method. Here, n represents the vanadium content in weight percentage. Compared with the traditional preparation method, such as the impregnation method and direct synthesis, (35) the oil–water biphase stratification reaction system was used in the experiment. The reaction system can slowly control the assembly and growth of the vanadium, surfactant, and silicate on the interfaces. Thus, continuous vanadium species were uniformly assembled in the mesopore walls, rather than the formation of agglomerate vanadium species (similar to V2O5). This in situ synthesis method allows controlling the monolayer coverage.
Firstly, the highly dispersed vanadium oxides in 3D dendritic MSNSs by in situ growth were synthesized. A series of characterizations, such as low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm, 29Si MAS NMR spectra, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), were utilized to discuss the structure of nV-MSNSs. To better examine the role of 2D vanadium oxide in the ODHP reaction and reaction–regeneration cycles on the silica support, Raman spectra, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV–vis spectra, NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), and thermo-gravimetry (TG) analyses were utilized. The 5.2V-MSNS catalyst was selected for the reaction–regeneration test with eight cycles, and the catalyst exhibited the high activity and stability for the ODHP in the presence of CO2.
2 Experimental Section
2.1 Preparation of nV-MSNS Catalysts
The spherical nV-MSNS catalysts with a particle size of ∼60 nm and a pore size of ∼4.5 nm were prepared by the in situ growth approach on the basis of a previous report. (33) The novel synthesis of nV-MSNSs was performed as following. In a typical process, 10.9 g of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and 0.36 g of triethanolamine (TEA) were dissolved in 90 mL of deionized water in a 250 mL conical flask at 60 °C to obtain a template aqueous solution; meanwhile, a certain amount of NH4VO3 was dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water in a 50 mL beaker at 60 °C. Subsequently, the NH4VO3 solution was added dropwise into the template aqueous solution under mechanical stirring at 60 °C for 1 h. Afterward, 40 mL of tetraethyl or thosilicate (TEOS) (20% v/v in cyclohexane) was carefully dropped into the above NH4VO3–CTAB–H2O–TEA solution. Finally, the obtained mixture was kept at 60 °C in an oil bath under gentle magnetic stirring (160 rpm) to avoid mixing of the phases. The upper oil phase was removed carefully after 12 h of the reaction, and the lower solution was heated at 90 °C for ripening. After 2 h, the resultant mixture was centrifuged (8000 rpm, 6 min) and washed several times with ethanol and deionized water to remove the residual reactants. The obtained solid powder was dried at 50 °C for 12 h and then calcined in air at 550 °C for 6 h at a heating rate of 1 °C/min to remove the template CTAB surfactants and obtain the final catalysts. Here, the obtained catalysts were denoted as nV-MSNSs, where n indicated the different amounts of vanadium varying from 1.3 to 8.0 wt %.
2.2 Characterizations
2.2.1 Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES)
The vanadium contents and silicon contents of nV-MSNS catalysts were measured by ICP-AES with Varian Vista MPX.
2.2.2 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
The XRD patterns of the nV-MSNS catalysts were collected on a Bragg–Brentano diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max-2000) with a monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The catalysts were pretreated at 550 °C in air. The samples were scanned from the 2θ value of 10–60° with a scan speed of 5°/min and 0.5–6° with a scan speed of 0.5°/min. The X-ray tube was manipulated at 40 kV and 30 mA.
2.2.3 Low-Temperature N2 Adsorption/Desorption
The specific surface area, total pore volume, and average pore diameter of the catalysts were measured by the N2 adsorption/desorption method with an automatic analyzer (NOVA 4000; Quantachrome). The sample should be degassed in vacuum at 300 °C for 4 h before the analysis. The specific surface areas were calculated by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The total pore volumes were calculated from the amount of vapor adsorbed at a relative pressure (P/P0) close to unity. The pore size distributions were obtained using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model.
2.2.4 29Si MAS NMR
The 29Si MAS NMR spectra of samples were measured using an AVANCE400 spectrometer operated at a frequency of 99.4 MHz. The magic angle spin speed used for 29Si spectral recording was 7 kHz.
2.2.5 UV–Vis
The catalysts were pretreated at 550 °C in air. The UV–vis spectra of the catalysts were recorded by the diffuse reflectance technique using the Shimadzu MPC-3100 spectrophotometer in the range of 220–800 nm, using BaSO4 as the reference. For the dehydrated samples, the Kubelka–Munk function was used to evaluate the band gap value (Eg) using the method of (F(R∞)·hν)2 against hν. The samples were dehydrated by treatment in 20% O2/Ar (50 mL min–1) at 300 °C for 1 h and subsequent cooling to room temperature.
2.2.6 FESEM
The FESEM images were obtained for the analysis of morphologies of surface particles of mesoporous samples using an S4800 scanning electron microscope.
2.2.7 TEM
The TEM images of nV-MSNSs catalysts were obtained on a JEM-2010 field emission transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV in vacuum.
2.2.8 X-ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS)
The XPS were used to analyze the binding energy values and the atomic surface concentration of the metal. The XPS measurements were recorded on the Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using Al Kα radiation. The samples were pressed into a thin slice and then degassed in vacuum at room temperature to remove the surface adsorbate. All of the samples were reduced in situ under hydrogen at 580 °C for 2.5 h. Binding energies (BE) were calibrated using the C1s level at 284.8 eV as an internal standard.
2.2.9 Raman
The Raman spectra were recorded using a Jobin Yvon confocal laser Raman system (SuperLabRam II), which was equipped with a He–Ne laser at 632.8 nm with a power of ca. 5 mW. Each spectrum was obtained by three accumulations, and the acquisition time was set at 30 s.
2.2.10 NH3-TPD
The measurement of TPD of NH3 was implemented to analyze the acidity of the catalysts. The sample (∼0.1 g) was pretreated at 400 °C for 1 h under a helium flow (30 mL min–1) before being cooled to 120 °C and saturated with the adsorbed gas. During desorption, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was utilized to record the TPD profiles from 120 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
2.2.11 H2-TPR
The H2-TPR experiments were carried out for the catalysts in a programmable temperature system. The H2-TPR analysis was tested on a Quantachrome IQ. The sample (0.1 g) was filled in a quartz reactor. Before the TPR analysis, the sample was treated in situ by flowing dry argon (15 mL min–1) at 500 °C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature. Before measuring, the baseline was stabilized in the gas flow at 25 °C for 60 min. The reactor was heated in a temperature-programmed furnace from room temperature to 800 °C (10 °C/min). The reducing gas was a H2 and Ar mixed gas (10% (v/v) H2). The H2 consumption as a function of the reduction temperature was continuously monitored with a TCD cell and recorded.
2.2.12 TG
The pretreatment of the catalysts was performed at 50 °C in air. TG analysis was performed on a Shimadzu DTG-60H thermogravimetric analyzer. The sample was kept under a N2 atmosphere. The system temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 °C at a rising rate of 20 °C/min.
2.2.13 TPO
TPO experiments were carried out in a programmable temperature system. First, the spent catalysts (0.05 g) were purged in flowing N2 (15 mL min–1) at 500 °C for 1 h. Then, the temperature was reduced to 40 °C to stabilize the baseline under this gas flow. Subsequently, the reactor was heated in an O2 and He mixed gas (10% (v/v) O2) from room temperature to 800 °C at 10 °C min–1. Finally, off-gas was detected by a TCD cell.
2.3 Catalytic Tests of ODHP
The catalytic tests were performed in a fixed-bed quartz reactor, and the catalyst (0.2 g) was placed into the center of the quartz reactor (the diagram of the experimental equipment is shown in Figure S-1). The temperature in the fixed bed was measured with an axially movable thermocouple located inside a quartz capillary. The catalysts were initially heated to 600 °C in a flow of Ar with a heating rate of 6 °C min–1. After flushing with CO2 for 30 min at 600 °C, the gas mixture consisting of C3H8, CO2, and Ar (C3H8/CO2/Ar molar ratio = 1/4/4, inlet flow = 15 mL min–1, space velocity of 4500 cm3 gcat–1 h–1) at 1 bar was fed to the reactor. After the test, the reactor was cooled to room temperature with a pure Ar flow. The products were analyzed by a gas chromatography (SP-6980). The gaseous products (CO, CO2) were detected by an online TCD with an AT-PLOT PORA-Q capillary column, and the other products (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8) were detected by a flame ionization detector chromatographic system. The propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and CO2 conversion were calculated by formulas (36) as

where C3H8in and C3H8out are the propane contents in the feed and exit steams, respectively; C3H6out is the propylene content in the exit steam; CO2in and CO2out are the CO2 content in the feed and exit steams, respectively.
Equation 4 was used to calculate an apparent consumption rate of propane

where i is the feed component, and Fi0, X(i), mcat, and VM stand for inlet flow (mL min–1), conversion, catalyst mass (g), and molar volume (mL mol–1), respectively.
The turnover-frequency (TOF) values per V atom were calculated according to eq 5

where ni0 is the molar flow of the hydrocarbon (mol s–1), MV is the vanadium atomic weight (50.94 g mol–1), and cV is the mass fraction of vanadium in the catalysts. This value represents the average catalytic activity of the vanadium atoms in the individual catalysts.
The reaction–regeneration cycles were performed as follows. The catalysts were reacted at 600 °C and regenerated under air atmosphere with a flow rate of 15 mL min–1 in situ at 550 °C for 30 min, and then the reaction temperature was raised to 600 °C for the catalytic reaction again.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structure Analysis of nV-MSNSs
3.1.1 Synthesis Mechanism of nV-MSNSs
The nV-MSNSs were prepared in a heterogeneous oil–water biphase stratification reaction system according to the previous report. (33) The whole process of catalyst preparation can be demonstrated by the 3D model in Scheme 1A(a–f),B(a–c). The upper oil phase consists of the silica source (TEOS) in a hydrophobic organic solution (cyclohexane), and the lower aqueous phase consists of the vanadium source (NH4VO3), the surfactant (CTAB), and the catalyst (TEA). When the pH value of the mixed aqueous phase is controlled between 10.5 and 11.5, the vanadium species mainly exist in the form of HVO42– at a low vanadium concentration (Scheme 1A(a)). (37, 38) Owing to gravity and interfacial curvature from the hydrophilic/hydrophobic interaction at the oil–water interface (Scheme 1A(b)), the TEOS of the upper layer gradually diffuses to the oil–water interface from the organic phase to form a silicate oligomer. Meanwhile, because the vanadium species and surfactant molecules are in a highly dispersed state, the vanadium species/silicate oligomer/surfactant nanoseeds can further self-assemble and grow with a “funneling” curvature, which is produced by the interaction and fusion between the upper oil phase and the surfactant organic phase (Scheme 1A(c)). Thus, continuous vanadium species can uniformly grow in the mesopore walls rather than form the agglomeration of vanadium species. The assembled mesopore walls can move erratically and get in touch with the interfaces constantly at a shear force due to gentle stirring (Scheme 1A(c,d)). Thus, the NPs with 3D direction growth channels can be generated. After calcination, the template CTAB surfactants and the hydrophobic organic phase in the mesopore channels were removed. Finally, the catalysts with good dispersion of vanadium oxide could be obtained.

With the increase of the vanadium concentration in the aqueous phase, V2O74– gradually becomes the major vanadium species. (37) In the self-assembling and growing process, because V2O74– has a larger ionic radius than HVO42–, V2O74– is easily adsorbed by two or more mesoporous walls. The growth process is demonstrated in Scheme 1B(a–c). Owing to the increment of the ionic radius of the vanadium species, the assembled mesopores decrease in size and volume, suggesting that much more hydrophilic inorganic species increase the thickness of the mesopore walls, and thus part of the pore space is occupied with the increment of the vanadium concentration. Numerous mesopore walls will compete for adsorption of V2O74– to realize further growth and assembly. The final formed silica nanospheres are slightly connected, which have little effect on the formation of 3D dendritic channels and the high dispersion of vanadium species. When the amount of vanadium species is higher, the NPs will exhibit a certain degree of aggregation. The excessive agglomeration of the NPs will block the mesoporous channels and lead to inefficient mass-transport and poor pore accessibility, which is what we are going to avoid.
3.1.2 Low-Temperature N2 Adsorption/Desorption Isotherm
To determine the textural properties of nV-MSNS catalysts, the low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of nV-MSNSs were studied, as shown in Figure 1. All of the isotherms show a type IV isotherm with a noticeable H2-type hysteresis loop at a relative pressure ranging from 0.4 to 0.7, implying that the typical mesoporous structure is maintained with highly dispersed vanadium into pure MSNSs. (16) On the basis of adsorption/desorption isotherms, the experimental parameters and textural properties of nV-MSNSs are summarized in Table 1, as calculated by the BJH method from the desorption branch of the isotherm. It displays that the pore diameters (Dp) of all of the catalysts are in the range of 4.31–4.91 nm. It can be noted that the specific surface area (SBET), pore diameter (Dp), and pore volume (Vp) of nV-MSNSs are lower than those of the pure MSNSs. As exhibited in Table 1, the reduction of SBET and Dp implies that the VOx species are located inside the mesoporous walls and surfaces, which is related to the increment of the ionic radius of the vanadium species, leading to the assembly of the mesopore walls with a larger size and more inorganic vanadium species. In addition, with the increase of the vanadium concentration, the effective mesopore channels are blocked gradually, leading to poor pore accessibility and a low pore volume. Hence, the above analysis provides a clear evidence for the introduction of vanadium species into the mesoporous walls by an in situ growth process.

3.1.3 29Si MAS NMR Spectra
The 29Si MAS NMR spectra of pure MSNSs, 2.6V-MSNSs, and 5.2V-MSNSs are shown in Figure S-2. All of the samples exhibit three signals at −93, −102, and −112 ppm characteristics of Q2, Q3, and Q4 silicon environments, which stand for (Si–O)2Si–(OH)2, (Si–O)3Si–OH, and Si(Si–O), respectively. (39) The Q2 and Q3 species are present at the surface of the silica particles, and, thus, the intensity ratio of (Q2 + Q3)/Q4 is related to the specific surface area of the silica sample. (40, 41) By fitting the multipeaks by the Gaussian method, the percentages of the peak area are obtained and summarized in Table 2. As the amount of vanadium increases, broadening of the Q4 peak along with a decrease in the Q3 signals are mostly due to substitution with an isomorphous vanadium metal substitution in the silica frameworks. Meanwhile, the reduction of the (Q2 + Q3)/Q4 value suggests that vanadium doping causes the partial substitution of the silanol groups and the shrinkage of the channels, which is in agreement with the low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorption analysis. Combining with Tables 1 and 2, it is obvious that the smaller (Q2 + Q3)/Q4 value leads to a smaller pore size with the increase of the vanadium content. It provides the evidence that vanadium loading markedly influences the pore size of nV-MSNSs, which is also in accordance with the growth mechanism shown in Scheme 1A,B.

The FESEM and TEM images of nV-MSNS samples are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. All of the samples exhibit a particle size of ∼60 nm. From the FETEM images (Figure 3), it can be seen that the nanospheres change from a uniformly monodispersed state to the slightly interlinked clusters with the increase of vanadium loading. This is related to the increment of the V2O74– ionic radius, which leads to the assembly of two or more new mesoporous walls (Scheme 1B(a–c)). The TEM images in Figure 4 show that the clear 3D dendritic mesoporous structure is well retained even if the aggregation of NPs appears, indicating that the nanospheres maintain the orderly 3D dendritic mesoporous silica frameworks at high vanadium concentrations. Therefore, the size and quantity of the vanadium species is the reason for the connection of the nanospheres, whereas it does not affect the assembly and growth of the 3D dendritic channels.

The elemental mapping images by the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis of Si and V of 5.2V-MSNSs are shown in Figure S-3. It can be seen that the VOx species are uniformly dispersed in the whole MSNS.
3.2 Characterization of the Vanadium Species
3.2.1 Raman Spectra
The oxidation state of vanadium species affects the catalytic activity. The different surface vanadium species can be identified by XRD pattern, Raman spectroscopy, UV–vis spectroscopy, and XPS spectra. (42-44)Figure S-4 shows wide-angle XRD patterns of the nV-MSNSs catalysts. No significant diffractions of bulk V2O5 are detected for all of the catalysts. The 3D V2O5 NPs can be detected with XRD (only for the NPs with a size greater than 4 nm), and all V2O5 NPs can be detected with Raman spectroscopy. (15)
Figure 4 shows the Raman spectra of nV-MSNS catalysts. The signal at 1030 cm–1 is assigned to 2D vanadium species, (3, 15, 45) indicating that VOx exists in its vanadyl (O═V) groups on the surfaces of MSNSs of nV-MSNS catalysts. The Raman signal at 920 cm–1 is ascribed to the vibration of the V–O–Si bonds. (42) Hence, the signals at around 920 and 1030 cm–1 appear in all of the samples except for pure MSNSs, which indicates that the highly dispersed 2D vanadium oxide can be obtained. It is generally accepted that the vanadyl (O═V) signal would shift toward 995 cm–1 (symmetric stretching of O═V groups) when crystalline V2O5 NPs were formed. (15) In Figure 4, no characteristic peak (∼995 cm–1) of crystalline V2O5 NPs is found for any sample. All of the samples show the weak Raman signals at 492, 602, and 835 cm–1, which are attributed to the symmetrical Si–O–Si stretching vibrations and the Si–OH stretch of the surface hydroxyl groups. Especially, the catalysts above 5.2 wt % V show the additional signals at around 271, 405, 523, and 704 cm–1, and the signal intensity increases with the increase of the vanadium content. The Raman signal at 271 cm–1 is attributed to the V–O–V bending mode, and the signals centered around 405, 523, and 704 cm–1 may correlate with the V–O–V stretching vibrations. (46) The Raman spectra of nV-MSNS catalysts coincide with those of hydrated vanadium supported by silica. (47, 48)
3.2.2 XPS Spectra
To further examine the chemical state of elements and surface composition of vanadium oxide species, XPS analyses were conducted. The XPS spectra for V2p3/2 of nV-MSNS catalysts are shown in Figure 5, which can be deconvoluted into three peaks with BE at 515.9, 517.4, and 518.8 eV, respectively. The peaks at 515.9 and 517.4 eV are assigned to VIII and VV, respectively, whereas the peak at 518.8 eV is attributed to the highly dispersed vanadium (VV) oxide. (42, 49)
Figure 5
Figure 5. XPS spectra of nV-MSNSs catalysts: (a) 1.3V-MSNSs; (b) 2.6V-MSNSs; (c) 4.4V-MSNSs; (d) 5.2V-MSNSs; (e) 6.1V-MSNSs; (f) 8.0V-MSNSs.
The semiquantitative results of the corresponding spectra are summarized in Table 3. As the vanadium loading increases, the peak of V species is evidently enhanced. At the same time, the percentage of the peak area of 517.4 eV increases from 39.1 to 68.5%, indicating that VV species increases with the loading of vanadium. It is worth noting that the percentage of the peak area at 518.8 eV gradually increases and attains the maximum value of 47.9% for 5.2V-MSNSs and then decreases with the further loading of vanadium, indicating that the 5.2V-MSNS sample has the better vanadium dispersion than others. The reduction of the peak intensity at 518.8 eV for the samples with vanadium content above 5.2 wt % implies that polymeric vanadium species with a larger VOx cluster size may be formed, which is consistent with the results of the above Raman analysis.

2.6V-MSNSs 33.6 40.6 25.8 39.2 26.9

8.0V-MSNSs 21.3 68.5 10.2 10.3 8.4
As shown in Table 3, the Si/V molar ratio determined by XPS (obtained from the surface) is slightly higher than the bulk Si/V molar ratio determined by ICP, which indicates that the VOx species are dispersed in the silicate framework with the homogeneous distribution instead of forming bulk V2O5 NPs on the support surface.
3.2.3 UV–Vis Spectra
The UV–vis spectra of nV-MSNS catalysts are presented in Figure 6. All of the spectra exhibit broad O → V charge-transfer (CT) bands. According to the literature, (50) the position of the CT bands indicates the vanadium coordination and the polymerization degree of the vanadium oxide species. The presence of an intense absorption band at 251 nm is assigned to tetrahedrally coordinated monomeric and dimeric VOx species. The band at 375 nm can be ascribed to tetrahedrally coordinated polyvanadate, due to the interaction between vanadium and water molecules in the atmosphere forming polymeric V–O–V bonds. The spectra are in good agreement with previously recorded spectra of hydrated vanadium supported by silica. (45, 47)
Figure 6
Figure 6. UV–vis spectra of the nV-MSNS catalysts: (a) pure MSNSs; (b) 1.3V-MSNSs; (c) 2.6V-MSNSs; (d) 4.4V-MSNSs; (e) 5.2V-MSNSs; (f) 6.1V-MSNSs; (g) 8.0V-MSNSs.
Diffuse reflectance UV–vis edge energy (EEdge) shifts of dehydrated nV-MSNSs are shown in Figure S-5. The edge energies of samples were evaluated using the Kubelka–Munk function proposed by Davis and Mott. (51) The EEdge values of supported vanadia materials, reflecting the VV ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) band, can be used to estimate the polymerization degree of VOx species. The EEdge value of polymeric VOx and 3D vanadium species shifts to a lower edge energy, due to greater electron delocalization in higher polymerization. (45) As previously reported, (35, 50, 52) in the form of F(R∞)·hν)2 ≈ const. (hν – ε0), the ε0 values of sodium orthovanadate (3.83 eV), metavanadate (3.16 eV), and bulk V2O5 (2.26 eV) can be used as ε0 standard values of compounds containing isolated monomeric tetrahedral units, linearly polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated oligomeric units, and octahedrally coordinated oligomeric units, respectively. Thus, EEdge between 3.16 and 3.83 eV is assigned to both monomeric and oligo/polymeric species with different degrees of polymerization and population.
According to the above Raman analysis, all of the catalysts contain only 2D vanadium oxide, and the corresponding EEdge values range from 3.00 to 3.40 eV. For a comparison of the catalysts with respect to the kind of VOx species, the surface V density and EEdge are shown in Table 1, and the relationship between them is displayed in Figure S-6. With the increase of vanadium surface density, the value of EEdge decreases gradually, revealing that the higher EEdge (1.3–5.2 wt % V) can be assigned to both highly dispersed monomeric and oligomeric vanadium oxide species and the lower EEdge (5.2–8.0 wt % V) can be ascribed to formation of more oligomeric units or a wider degree of their oligomerization. (35) Therefore, it is clearly found that the polymeric VOx species and the degree of polymerization increase with the increase of the vanadium surface density.
3.3 Catalytic Performances of nV-MSNSs in the ODHP Reaction
3.3.1 NH3-TPD Profiles
To investigate the influence of vanadium concentration on the acidity of nV-MSNS catalysts, the NH3-TPD analysis was conducted and is shown in Figure 7. It is well known that the DH performance of light paraffin is closely related to the acidic properties of catalyst surfaces. (1) As can be seen from the profiles, all of the catalysts display similar shape desorption peaks at 150–200 °C, which are ascribed to weak acid sites; these can be attributed to the isolated tetrahedral-like coordinated VOx species. (53) The desorption peak at 200–350 °C can be ascribed to medium acid sites. With the increase of vanadium loading, the intensity of weak acid desorption peaks increases and shifts to the high-temperature zone. Moreover, the catalyst of 4.4V-MSNSs begins to appear at medium acid desorption peaks. A semiquantitative analysis of the acidic strength distribution by using the Gaussian curve fitting method is summarized in Table 4. It is found that the temperature of maximal peak intensity (TM) and the total number of acid sites increase clearly with the increase of the vanadium surface density. As reported previously, (54) when the surface vanadium coverage approaches or exceeds the monolayer limitation, the vanadium surface density not only determines the polymerization degree of VOx species but also markedly influences the surface acidity of catalysts. As shown in Figures S-6 and S-7, for the catalysts with a low surface vanadium coverage, the EEdge value clearly decreases with the increase in acidity of the corresponding nV-MSNS catalysts. It can be explained that the existence of polymeric VOx species at high vanadium doping leads to an increase in the higher surface acidity of catalysts.

3.3.2 H2-TPR Profiles
To investigate the effect of the vanadium oxide species on the reducibility of active species, H2-TPR measurements were carried out, and the corresponding profiles of the nV-MSNS catalysts are shown in Figure 8. It can be seen that all of the catalysts present only one reduction peak centered at 523–550 °C, which can be attributed to the reduction of VV to VIII. As the vanadium content increases from 1.3 to 8.0 wt %, the intensity of the reduction peaks increases obviously, and the reduction peak gradually shifts to the higher temperature (523 → 550 °C). As reported previously, (55) the results indicate that the characteristics of the reduction peaks can be affected by either the amount of vanadium or the dispersion of VOx species (such as monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric species) on the support. The H2-TPR profiles combined with UV–vis edge energy results show an interesting conformity, which indicates that the catalyst presenting a higher-temperature reduction peak exhibits a lower EEdge value. Thus, the reduction peak shifts to a higher temperature with increasing vanadium loading as the polymerization degree of vanadium oxide increases. Another reason is the reduction process kinetics described by the Kissinger equation. (56) In H2-TPR experiments, with increasing vanadium loading, the formed water and the decrease in the actual hydrogen concentration during the reduction lead to the slowdown of the reaction and the shift of reduction to a higher temperature.
Figure 8
Figure 8. H2-TPR profiles of nV-MSNS catalysts.
The molar ratio of H2/V was used to estimate the amount of redox VV in the fresh nV-MSNS catalysts. (57) The H2 consumptions of nV-MSNS catalysts and the molar ratios of H2/V were calculated by using the Gaussian curve fitting method from the normalized reduction peaks, and the results are displayed in Table 5. It is clear that the amount of H2 consumption increases as the vanadium content increases. However, the H2/V molar ratio gradually decreases as the vanadium content increases from 5.2 to 8.0 wt %, which can be ascribed to the decrease of efficient redox VV due to the formation of higher-polymerized VOx species at a higher vanadium content. The low H2/V molar ratio of around 0.6–0.7 is found for all of the samples. Combined with XPS results and TPR results, it can be seen that V(III) species in catalysts is one reason for the reduction of hydrogen consumption and the low values of H2/V. In addition, part of the vanadium atoms may be buried inside the walls of mesoporous silica through the in situ growth approach, which may be another reason for the low value of H2/V. By comparing the H2-TPR results with UV–vis results, it can be seen that the molar ratio of H2/V increases with the increase of vanadium concentration when the edge energy falls between 3.11 and 3.31, whereas the trend is opposite when the edge energy is lower than 3.11. This indicates that the catalysts have mainly monomeric VV oxide together with lower-polymerized VV oxides because the major vanadium species is below 5.2 wt % content, and the higher-polymerized VOx species gradually generate above 5.2 wt % vanadium content. The previous studies reported that higher-polymerized VOx was less reducible than lower-polymerized VOx.

3.3.3 Catalytic Performance
The reaction was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at 600 °C with a feed flow consisting of C3H8/Ar/CO2 (molar ratio) = 1:4:4, at a total flow rate of 15 mL min–1 (space velocity: 4500 cm3 gcat–1 h–1). The reaction reaches a steady state after around 19 h and runs continuously for 24 h. The results in Figure 9 give a propane conversion of 19%, a propylene selectivity of 89%, and a propane reaction rate of 1.06 × 10–5 kmolC3H8 kgcat–1 s–1 corresponding to a TOF of 10.4 × 10–3 molC3H6 molVOx–1 s–1, which is markedly higher than the TOF values ((0.9–7.1) × 10–3 molC3H6 molVOx–1 s–1) of the typical supported VOx-SBA-15 catalysts in previous reports. (4, 15, 58) The high catalytic performances of nV-MSNSs should be attributed to highly dispersed vanadium species by the in situ growth method.
Figure 9
Figure 9. Time on-stream for propane conversion and propylene selectivity over 5.2V-MSNS catalysts.
The propane conversion and propylene selectivity of nV-MSNS catalysts for the ODHP reaction are displayed in Figure 10. As can be seen from Figure 10A, with the moderate increase of vanadium concentration, propane conversion has an obvious enhancement. The highest initial propane conversion of 58% can be achieved for the 5.2V-MSNS catalyst, whereas the catalysts with vanadium content above 5.2 wt % exhibit reduced propane conversions. The relationships of the vanadium content with the H2/V molar ratio and initial catalytic activity are shown in Figures S-8 and S-9. It can be noted that the H2/V molar ratio and initial catalytic activity increase steeply with increasing amounts of vanadium and reach the maximum values at 5.2 wt % vanadium content, indicating that an optimum amount of vanadium doping exists. Additional vanadium loading leads to the decrease in both the H2/V molar ratio and initial propane conversion. Figure 11 shows the variations of propane conversion and TOF values with the vanadium surface densities of nV-MSNS catalysts. Obviously, a clear conversion maximum around 0.9V nm–2 (around the 5.2V-MSNS catalyst) can be observed, indicating that not all vanadia are accessible (active) beyond this loading due to an increased fraction of higher-polymerized VOx species. The TOF of propylene production strongly decreases with increasing vanadium loading, and a similar trend at low V surface density is observed for vanadia-based MCF (9) and SBA-15 (4) catalysts. These results can be ascribed to the formed less-active and higher-polymerized VOx species, which can be confirmed by Raman and UV–vis spectra analysis (Figures 4 and S-5). From Figure 10B, all of the catalysts have high propylene selectivity at about 90%, which should be attributed to the highly dispersed 2D vanadium oxides, and the highest propylene selectivity is also found over the 5.2V-MSNS catalyst.

Figure 11
Figure 11. Variation of the propane conversion and TOF (two-hour reaction) with the vanadium surface densities of nV-MSNS catalysts.
According to the textural parameters in Table 1, regardless of the amount of vanadium in the catalysts, the textural properties of catalysts may be a minor reason for the low catalytic activity for the catalysts containing a higher vanadium content. It can be explained that 3D dendritic MSNSs present slight aggregation when the vanadium concentration is overly high (TEM analysis from Figure 3). In addition, excessive agglomeration of nanospheres will block mesoporous channels, leading to inefficient mass-transport and poor pore accessibility.
To investigate the effect of CO2 on the ODHP reaction, the catalytic tests of the 5.2V-MSNS catalyst were performed with and without CO2 flow. The results are shown in Figure 12. It can be seen that the presence of CO2 significantly improves the propane conversion and propylene selectivity. This result verifies that CO2 plays a promoting role in the ODHP reaction by participating in the coupling reaction. It is to say that CO2 reacts with H2 produced by the DH reaction through a reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which is demonstrated in Scheme 2.

For monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica, the reaction pathway of the ODHP has been proposed in detail. (23) In the first step, the oxygen of a vanadyl (O═V) group abstracts a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon atom of propane. The second hydrogen abstraction occurs at the oxygen of the V–O–Si bond yielding H2O·VIII or at the oxygen of a fresh vanadyl (O═V) group yielding two HO–VIV species, and then propylene is released from the vanadium active site. A similar mechanism has also been proposed by other researchers by DFT calculations and microkinetic simulations. The dimeric and oligomeric VOx species have a similar catalysis reaction process below the monolayer coverage. (24) Combined with catalytic performance of the 5.2V-MSNS catalysts, it can be proposed that the appropriate polymerization degree of vanadium oxide markedly influences the ODHP catalytic reaction. It has been reported that CO2 acts as a soft oxidant and regenerates the active VV sites through the fast reoxidation process, (59) which may be another reason for the improvement of catalytic performance in the presence of CO2.

Scheme 2
Scheme 2. Reaction and Regeneration Cycle Mechanism for the ODHP of Monomeric VOx Species
From Figure 10A, the quick deactivation is observed for all of the nV-MSNS catalysts in the initial 2 h. To investigate the effect of coke deposition on the catalyst deactivation, after 2 h of the ODHP reaction, the TG measurements of the spent catalysts are carried out, and the results are shown in Figure S-10 and Table 6. The weight loss below 200 °C could be considered as the loss of surface and adsorption water, and the weight loss between 200 and 450 °C is ascribed to the coke on the catalyst surface. It is well known that coke formation is closely related to the acidity of the catalyst surface. (60, 61) By comparing NH3-TPD results with TG results, it clearly shows that the amount of coke deposition increases with the increasing acidity of the catalyst (Figure S-11), and the partial active sites may be covered by coke deposition.

3.4 Reaction–Regeneration Cycles
To investigate the catalytic stability, the 5.2V-MSNS catalyst is selected for the reaction–regeneration test for eight cycles, with each cycle of 2 and 8 h. As shown in Figure 13, for the former, the propane conversion decreases to about 34% after the 2 h ODHP reaction, whereas for the latter, propane conversion decreases to about 25% after the 8 h ODHP reaction. The propylene selectivity varies little for both the 2 h or the 8 h reaction periods. For both tests, the propane conversions are almost restored to the initial value after each reaction–regeneration cycle. It means that the regeneration performance can be maintained by increasing the reaction time in each cycle, and the dispersion of VOx species is unchanged after the longer-duration regeneration cycle. To explore this, H2-TPR measurements of the fresh 5.2V-MSNS catalyst and the regenerated catalysts after eight cycles were carried out and are shown in Figure 14. The regenerated catalysts after eight cycles were denoted as 2.5V-8/2h-R and 2.5V-8/8h-R, representing the reaction time of 2 and 8 h in each cycle, respectively. From Figure 14, it can be observed that the intensity of the reduction peaks has no significant variation, indicating that the active VOx sites are almost completely recovered after regeneration, and the reducibility of active VOx sites is an important factor for the decrease of the catalytic performance.
Figure 13

Figure 14
Figure 14. H2-TPR profiles of 5.2V-MSNS catalysts.
A favorable reaction–regeneration performance also can be confirmed from Raman spectra in Figure 15. In the Raman test, the deactivated catalysts after eight cycles were denoted as 5.2V-8/2h-D and 5.2V-8/8h-D, respectively. By comparing the fresh 5.2V-MSNSs with the deactivated samples, it is clearly seen that the signals at 271, 429, 516, and 704 cm–1 and the V–O–Si signal at 920 cm–1 of the deactivated catalysts disappear, indicating that the partial active sites are covered by coke deposition after the 2 or 8 h ODHP reaction. In addition, on comparing with the fresh catalyst, it is observed that the peak intensity at 1030 cm–1 (vanadyl group) significantly decreases for the deactivated catalysts, and the peak intensity of the 5.2V-8/8h-D catalysts is weaker than that of the 5.2V-8/2h-D catalysts. This means that the active vanadium sites decrease due to the ODHP reaction, and the decline degree is enhanced with the increase of the reaction time. After regeneration, all of the peaks are recovered to their original states for the regenerated catalysts of 2.5V-8/2h-R and 2.5V-8/8h-R. The results suggest that the active VOx sites are completely recovered by calcination in situ, which is in agreement with the H2-TPR results of 2.5V-8/2h-R and 2.5V-8/8h-R.
Figure 15
Figure 15. Raman spectra of 5.2 V-MSNS catalysts.
Figure 16 shows the Raman spectra of the spent 5.2V-MSNS catalysts (5.2V-8/2h-D and 5.2V-8/8h-D). The bands at 1338 and 1599 cm–1 are commonly marked as the D band and G band and can be ascribed to the C–H bending and C═C stretching in aromatic and alkyl hydrocarbons, respectively. (62, 63) The intensity ratio of D band to G band (ID/IG) is usually used as one index of the graphitization degree of carbon materials, and a high ID/IG value represents a low graphitization degree. (64) In this work, the ID/IG values of the 2.5V-8/2h-D and 2.5V-8/8h-D catalysts are 2.89 and 2.26, respectively, which indicates that the graphitization degree of the 2.5V-8/8h-D sample is higher than that of the 2.5V-8/2h-D sample. It is verified that the increasing reaction time in each cycle can increase the graphitization degree of coke on the catalyst surface.
Figure 16
Figure 16. Raman spectra of spent 5.2 V-MSNS catalysts.
To further investigate the nature of the coke, TG and TPO measurements were conducted upon the spent catalysts. A fresh 5.2V-MSNS catalyst was used as a reference in the atmosphere of air. As depicted in Figure S-12, the weight loss between 200 and 450 °C for 2.5V-8/2h-D and 2.5V-8/8h-D catalysts are 2.30 and 2.56%, respectively. A slightly higher amount of coke on the 2.5V-8/8h-D catalyst is observed. As reported previously, the weight loss of spent catalysts is caused by the combustion of coke on active vanadium sites. (54, 62) From Figure S-12, the weight losses of 2.5V-8/2h-D and 2.5V-8/2h-D start around 200 and 300 °C, respectively, suggesting that the weight loss is caused by the combustion of different coke species. The TPO profiles in Figure S-13 can also reflect the coke species and the amount on the surfaces of 2.5V-8/2h-D and 2.5V-8/8h-D. The combustion peaks at 350 and 420 °C suggest the different graphitization degrees of coke on the surfaces of 2.5V-8/2h-D and 2.5V-8/8h-D, which is consistent with the Raman results (Figure 16). The rapid deactivation of the catalysts is mainly due to the coke formation and the reduction of the active vanadium site. These factors can be completely eliminated by in situ regeneration, and the excellent catalytic performance of the 5.2V-MSNS catalyst is still maintained after eight cycles. The stability of the reaction–regeneration makes up for the defect of the quick deactivation of the reported vanadium catalyst. (6, 35, 53, 65) Hence, an active and stable catalyst has been prepared for the potential commercial catalyst for the ODHP reaction.
4 Conclusions
In this work, the nV-MSNSs were successfully synthesized and characterized by several state-of-the-art methods. The synthesized nV-MSNSs were applied to the ODHP with the presence of CO2 and exhibited excellent catalytic performances. The low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm, 29Si MAS NMR, FESEM, and TEM analyses confirm that the vanadium components are introduced into the mesoporous walls during the growth and assembly process and lead to the reduction of SBET, Vp, and Dp with the increment of the vanadium concentration. Moreover, Raman, UV–vis, XPS, and TEM analyses indicate that, as the amount of vanadium increases, the polymerization degree increases gradually with the increase of the vanadium surface density. The H2-TPR characterization indicates that the molar ratio of H2/V reaches the maximum value for the 5.2V-MSNS catalyst, suggesting that higher-polymerized VOx species are formed at a higher vanadium content.
The 5.2V-MSNSs exhibits the highest catalytic activity with the initial propane conversion of 58% for the ODHP. The deactivated catalysts can be completely eliminated by the in situ regeneration process. The excellent catalytic performance can be maintained after eight reaction–regeneration cycles. Hence, novel nV-MSNS catalysts with high activity and stability are prepared for the potential commercial catalysis of the ODHP reaction.
