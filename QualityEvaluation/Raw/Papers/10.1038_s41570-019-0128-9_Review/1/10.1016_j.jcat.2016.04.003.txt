1. Introduction
The need to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere is pushing toward the use of ‘‘renewable carbon”, so
to avoid as much as possible burning ‘‘fossil carbon”. Biomass is
synonym of ‘‘renewable carbon”, as it is re-generated from CO2,
usually captured from atmosphere. A ‘‘close to zero emission” cycle
can in principle be implemented that effectively reduces the emis-
sion of CO2. It would be possible to complement the natural ‘‘car-
bon cycle” by developing man-made industrial processes for
‘‘carbon recycling”, converting, thus, ‘‘spent carbon” as CO2 into
‘‘working carbon”, as that present in valuable chemicals or fuels.
Such practice would fall again into the utilization of ‘‘renewable
carbon”, as the man-made process would perfectly mimic the nat-
ural process. An order of complexity higher would be represented
by the integration of biotechnology and catalysis for an effective
CO2 conversion, using selective catalysts such as enzymes, or even
whole microorganisms, coupled to chemical technologies for
energy supply to enzymes, using perennial sources as sun or wind
or geothermal as primary energy.
These days all the above approaches are under investigation
with an interesting complementarity of public–private investment
in research.
This paper aimed at showing the state of the art of CO2 conver-
sion and giving a perspective view of such technology.
Each atom of C we can recycle is an atom of fossil carbon left in the
underground for next generations that will not reach the atmosphere
today.
1.1. Where we are
The chemical utilization of CO2 is not a new attitude. Industrial
processes were developed as early as in the 1880–1893s, namely:
the synthesis of urea [1], the soda Solvay process, the synthesis of

hydrogen carbonates [2], and the production of salicylic acid [3].
Interestingly, in the former process CO2 recovered from the
synthesis of NH3 is used. In the 1900s there was not a great interest
in developing new applications of CO2. As a matter of fact, since the
late 1800s the chemistry of CO (derived from fossil carbon) has
been developed for the synthesis of chemicals and fuels that had
its golden era in the 1900–1970s, and still today plays a key role
in the production of chemicals and fuels. Only in the 1970s there
was a revival in the exploitation of CO2 as additive to CO in the
synthesis of methanol [4] and as co-monomer in the pioneering
production of organic carbonates from epoxides [5], via direct
carboxylation. Table 1 gives the actual use of carbon dioxide in
the synthesis of chemicals and the perspective use at 2030 [6], cal-
culated considering the expected market growth for the listed
chemicals and assuming that new technologies will be developed
that ensure a large conversion of CO2. Data reported in Table 1
show that in the best of cases the utilization of CO2 will grow from
180 Mt/y in 2014 to 207 Mt/y in 2016 and 332 Mt/y in 2030: a drop
in the ocean of the over 35,000 Mt/y emitted today. Such scenario
validates the position of those who say that the conversion of CO2
into chemicals will not contribute to the CO2 emission reduction.
We anticipate that what has value is the amount of avoided CO2
more than the amount of used CO2: the ratio avoided/used may
span over a range 2–5, with a good average around 3.
This gives a different weight to the utilization option as 1 Gt/y
of avoided CO2 may be a realistic goal in 2030. Should CO2 be
converted into fuels, a new perspective opens and the Carbon
Capture and Utilization-CCU option may play a fundamental role
in avoiding CO2.
Table 1 also shows the oxidation state of the carbon-atom in the
various compounds listed. This is a key point as the energetics of
any reaction depends on the variation of the C-oxidation state in
the reaction. Fig. 1 shows the Gibbs free-energy of formation of
several C1 species.
It is quite evident that when the oxidation state of the carbon
atom is reduced from +4 in CO2 to 2 or lower, a signiﬁcant amount
of energy is needed, while when the oxidation state remains +4 or
close to it (+3 in C2 species such as oxalic acid, HO2CACO2H) the
reaction is quasi-neutral (i.e., synthesis of organic carbonates and
carbamates, located in the circle around CO2) or even exothermic
as in the synthesis of inorganic carbonates, which lie well below
CO2. On this basis, in the middle 1980s we have classiﬁed the
CO2 reactions in two classes [7], according to the fact that CO2 is
incorporated such as in the product (Class A) or it is converted into
one of its reduced forms (Class B).
Class A: CO2 ﬁxation into inorganic carbonates-M2CO3, organic
carbonates-(RO)2CO, carbamates-RR0NACO2R, polycarbonates,
polyurethanes, isocyanates-NCO.
Class B: CO2 reduction to CO or hydrogenated products such as
methanol, methane, and higher hydrocarbons.
Noticeably, the two classes are characterized by a distinct use of
the products and a quite different size of their market. Class A spe-
cies fall into the chemicals market, while Class B are fuels with a
market that is some 12–14 times that of chemicals. Therefore, if
one targets to convert large volumes of CO2 one must pursue its
conversion into fuels. And here a new issue arises about the neces-
sary energy for the conversion (see Fig. 1) and the hydrogen for the
production of hydrocarbons. It is obvious that H2 cannot be derived
from fossil C, but must come from water or organic waste, while
energy must be supplied by perennial sources such as sun, wind,
and geothermal. A new approach must be developed for H2 pro-
duction with respect to the actual one based on the reforming (of
coke or methane) at high temperature, a strongly endergonic pro-
cess (Eqs. (1)–(3)).

1.2. Key issues in the conversion of CO2
The conversion of CO2 is a quite complex issue [8], complicated
by the fact that if it targets carbon mitigation, the carbon balance
must be kept under strict control, with the concept of ‘‘avoided”
CO2 winning on that of ‘‘used” CO2. As a matter of fact, the use of
CO2 in new chemical processes can be quite interesting as it avoids
the emission of large volumes of CO2 (with respect to processes on
stream), much larger than that of the amount of converted CO2.
Correct values of ‘‘used” and ‘‘avoided” CO2 may be obtained by
applying the LCA methodology. An early example is given by the
use of LCA in the comparative analysis of different synthetic
methodologies for the production of cyclic carbonates [9]. It is
worth to emphasize that the correctness of the ﬁgures depends
on the quality of available data. At the time of the above study very
limited data were available. Today, more reliable data are loaded in
continuously up dated data bases and ﬁgures obtained from pilot
plants are more and more at the hand. This may assist to make a
much better estimate of new processes based on CO2. Fig. 2 shows
the amount of CO2 emitted in processes based on the use of
phosgene (on stream since the 1970s) vs the amount emitted in
innovative processes based on the use of CO2 [8].
It is clear that what really matters is not the amount of CO2 used
(0.5 t/tcarbonate) but the amount of CO2 avoided (the amount of CO2
emitted in the process based on phosgene (almost ca. 6–9 t/tcarbonate)
minus the amount of CO2 emitted in the direct carboxylation,
1.32 t/tcarbonate). A parameter that can be used for the assessment
of processes is the ratio of CO2 avoided/CO2 used. For the carboxyla-
tion of propene oxide (similar to reaction (a) in Fig. 2) it is estimated
to range around 3.5 today.
We now come to a key point: synthetic routes based on CO2
must respond to a stringent requisite, namely: the new process must
minimize the CO2 emission with respect to processes on stream. In
order to satisfy such condition, an immediate sub-condition is:
the CO2-based process must be a consumer and not a producer of CO2.
1.3. Performance indicators in CO2 conversion
Indicators which may help to assess a CO2-based process are as
follows:
(a) the carbon utilization fraction (the percentage of reagent-C
ﬁxed into the products);
(b) the carbon-footprint (the CO2 emission in the process per
unit of product);
(c) the energy consumption factor (ratio of the input- to output-
energy);
(d) the waste production factor (waste produced per unit of
product, w/w);
(e) the ‘‘avoided” to ‘‘used” ratio.
The above indicators heavily depend on the reaction conditions.
The reaction ‘‘parameter space” is deﬁned by the following factors:
i. Solvent; ii. co-reagents; iii. catalysts; iv. temperature; v. pres-
sure; vi. overall energy expenditure-time of reaction; vii. conver-
sion of reagents; viii. formation of co-products/selectivity of the
process; ix. waste generation; and x. end of process separation
energy.
In order to maximize the beneﬁt, the above parameters must
respond to the conditions listed below:
i. The solvent can be one of the reagents. Solventless reactions
can be a good solution. The use of sc-CO2 may be beneﬁcial.
ii. Co-reagents must be used in stoichiometric amount and be
converted at their maximum. This is particularly true when
H2 is used. Any excess must be recovered.
iii. Catalysts must be simple and cheap (earth abundant ele-
ments), recoverable, reusable.
iv. The temperature must be as low as possible, and selected
also taking into consideration the separation step. Tempera-
ture sweep must be avoided as the heat is not completely
recovered and reused (especially at low temperature) and
considerable energy loss occur.
v. The reaction pressure should be kept as low as possible.
Pressurized liquid reaction mixtures and sc-conditions must
be comparatively evaluated considering reaction rates, con-
version yields and selectivities.
vi. The overall energy expenditure must be kept as low as
possible.
vii. The conversion of reagents should be maximized.
viii. The formation of co-products should be minimized. Very
active catalysts may favor the occurrence of several reac-
tions at the same time, with increase of the conversion yield
but lowering selectivity and increasing the post-process sep-
aration cost. Often such co-products are formed from co-
reagents in equimolar amount with the target product. In
case of large-scale (>Mt) chemicals such co-products must
be either marketable or converted back into the original
co-reagent.
ix. The waste generation (including waste solvents) must be
minimized as waste will produce CO2 during its ﬁnal
processing-burning.
x. The post-reaction process for product isolation may play a
key role in the overall energy expenditure. Sometimes it is
better to achieve a lower conversion with 100% selectivity
than a high conversion with formation of several byproducts
difﬁcult to separate.
All
the
above
issues
are
considered
when
a
life
cycle
assessment-LCA study is performed. Such methodology is the one
that can give a reliable answer to the question whether a particular
use of CO2 is avoiding CO2 emission or increasing it. Having set
such a frame to the objective of using CO2 for the production of
chemicals and fuels, we can face the aspect of how we can use
CO2 in proﬁtable ways that contribute to the reduction of the

2. CO2 properties, coordination chemistry and reactions
In this session we brieﬂy discuss the electronic properties of
CO2 and the structural changes the cumulene undergoes upon
coordination to a metal center. These concepts are relevant to
any metal-driven conversion of CO2.
2.1. Electronic properties of CO2
CO2 has a linear geometry (D1h) in its ground state, with both
the carbon–oxygen bonds being equivalent and displaying an equi-
librium CAO distance of 1.1600 Å [10,11]. The valence electronic
conﬁguration of CO2 (16 valence electrons) in the linear ground
state, 1Rg
+, is 3rg

24rg
23ru
21pu
41pg
4 [12]. Fig. 3 shows a schematic
and simpliﬁed representation of the molecular orbitals (MOs) of
CO2.
Combination of 2s and 2pz of all the three atoms generates six r
molecular orbitals. Three couples of doubly degenerate reciprocally
orthogonal p-orbitals (1pux and 1puy; 1pgx and 1pgy; 2pux and
2puy) are obtained from combining the remaining 2px and 2py orbi-
tals of carbon and oxygens. The non bonding 1pgx and 1pgy MOs
have null weight on the carbon atom and, therefore, are localized
on the terminal oxygens, while the antibonding 2pux and 2puy
MOs are mainly localized on the carbon atom, as they have a
preponderant 2pxC and 2py character, respectively. Of the eight
occupied molecular orbitals, both 3rg and 2ru are responsible
for the r bonding skeleton of the molecule, while the 1pu orbitals
account for the CAO p bonds. By contrast, the electrons 4rg, 3ru
and 1pg are, r and p lone pairs, respectively.
Fig. 4 reports the Walsh diagram [13] for the CO2 molecule
showing qualitatively the variation of the MOs energies with the
change of OCO bond angle. The energies of the r-orbitals increase
or remain practically unaffected upon the change of molecular
symmetry (D1h ? C2v).
However, the energies of p-orbitals show more important
changes. The degeneracy of the p-orbitals is lost in the bent
geometry and the formerly degenerated p-orbitals separate in
two non-equivalent orbitals with different energies. The splitting
of the levels 1pu and 1pg is modest and the destabilization of
1pu(5a1)
is roughly counterbalanced by
the
stabilization of
1pu(1b1). By contrast, the energies of both 1pg orbitals increase
upon bending, much faster for 1pg(4b2) than for 1pg(1a2). The
energy of the 2pu(2b1) orbital is only slightly affected by the mole-
cule bending. The rapid increase of the energy of 1pg(4b2) with
diminution of the bond angle accounts for the linearity of the
CO2 molecule in the ground state. However, bending causes a
marked decrease of the energy of the 2pu(6a1) MO, which can
become even more stable than 1pg(4b2). The behavior of the
2pu(6a1) MO upon molecule bending suggests that population of
the 2pu(6a1) level is expected to produce a distortion of CO2 molecule
from linearity. This statement ﬁnds several validations, for instance,
when considering:
– the geometry of the CO2 lowest excited states, related with the
electronic conﬁguration 1ru

the cumulene interacts with the metal center through the
C-atom, as observed both g1-C adducts and g2-C, O (side-on)
mononuclear and polynuclear complexes (vide infra).

Upon addition of an extra electron the CO2 molecule converts
into the radical anion CO2
 (Eq. (4)). The latter species, generated in
many ways and trapped in solid matrices, shows a bent equilibrium
geometry (C2v symmetry) in the 2A1 ground state ((1a1)2(1b2)2
(2a1)2(3a1)2(2b2)2(4a1)2(3b2)2
(1b1)2(5a1)2(1a2)2(4b2)2(6a1)1;
see
also Fig. 4), with elongated CO bonds and the value of OCO angle
ranging around 130 [15].

Reaction (4) is an endergonic process. A value of 0.6 ± 0.2 eV
has been measured for the adiabatic electron afﬁnity (EAad) of
the CO2 ground state [16]. In the gas phase CO2
 is metastable
against electron autodetachment. The reason for the metastability
of the anion (lifetimes in the range of 30–90 ls) is ascribed to the
fact that the change of the molecular geometry from the 2A1 state
of CO2
 to the ground state of CO2, has a barrier of 0.4 eV [17]. Con-
version of CO2 to CO2
 anion is regarded as an important mode of
activating the molecule and represents the ﬁrst of the reactive
steps leading to the partial or full reduction of the heterocumulene.
The change of geometry upon e transfer to CO2 may affect the rate
of the process. Such features are relevant to the electrochemical
reduction of CO2 as discussed in Section 4.2.
Removal of a 1pg electron from CO2 molecule to afford the CO2
+
radical cation in the
2Pg ground state requires an energy of
13.79 eV [18], by far larger than that needed for the formation of
the radical anion CO2
 [16] or for the dissociation of neutral CO2
to CO and atomic oxygen [19]. Spectroscopic measurements [20]
show that CO2
+ in its 2Pg ground state is a linear molecule with
D1h point group symmetry: the two CAO bonds are equivalent
with a length, which is only slightly longer (1.1769 Å) than that
measured in the neutral molecule. The above features are relevant
to the states of CO2 coordinated in different ways to various metal
systems (Fig. 4).
2.2. Spectroscopic (IR, UV, NMR) properties of CO2
IR and NMR spectroscopies have been widely employed as
diagnostic tools of the state of the CO2 molecule and even for quan-
titative determinations. UV–visible spectroscopy has found less
extensive use. However, the spectroscopic properties of CO2 in
the UV region are of fundamental importance for understanding
the photochemistry of this molecule [19].
Fig. 5 summarizes the spectroscopic properties of CO2 in the IR
region [21–23].
Table 2 compares the IR fundamental frequencies of gaseous
CO2 with those measured for gaseous CO2
+ [24] and for CO2
 isolated
in solid neon [25,26] where the radical anion is free from interac-
tions with metal cations. In the IR spectrum of CO2
, because of the
bent geometry (C2v) of the anion, all the three normal vibration
modes are IR active. The stretching frequencies are shifted to lower
values, which reﬂect a reduced average CO bond order (1.5 in CO2

vs 2 in CO2).
As it will be discussed later, the formation of CO2 metal
complexes or, more generally, CO2-adducts can originate large
modiﬁcations
in
the
IR
spectrum
of
the
CO2
moiety
[27].
The antisymmetric stretching mode, ma(OCO), falls in the range
2250–1400 cm1,
the
symmetric
stretching
mode,
ms(OCO),
becomes IR-active and can absorb in the region 1400–1100 cm1,
the bending mode d(OCO) is shifted from 667 cm1. Additional
vibrational modes, such as metal–carbon and/or metal–oxygen
stretching modes, C@O out-of-plane deformation, may be observed
in the low-frequency region (down to 300 cm1). The latter spec-
troscopic features can provide useful information on the bonding
mode of the heterocumulene in the adduct, so that IR is quite diag-
nostic for understanding the state of CO2 interacting with metal
systems (atoms or complexes).
Carbon dioxide is transparent in the visible and near-to-middle
ultraviolet regions, at least down to 210 nm (hm < 5.91 eV), both in
the liquid phase and in the gas phase [20]. Only weak absorptions
can be observed below 11 eV, in the vacuum ultraviolet region, at
147.5 (8.41 eV), 133.2 (9.31 eV) and 112.1 nm (11.08 eV), respec-
tively. Above 11 eV there are several Rydberg series converging
to the various states of CO2
+.
CO2 dissolved in a nonpolar solvent (benzene, toluene) displays
only one 13C NMR signal around 124 ppm. In aqueous solutions,
the resonance is close to 125 ppm and can be used for the quantiﬁ-
cation of free CO2. 13C NMR has proved to be a very useful spectro-
scopic technique for identifying the ‘‘CO2” moiety incorporated
into a metal-compound (metal complexes, metal-carbamates LnM
(O2CNR2), metal-hemicarbonates LnM(O2COR), metal-carboxylates
LnM(O2CR),
metallacarboxylic
acids
LnM(CO2H),
metallaesters
LnM(CO2R)) [28] or organic products, such as carbamic acids or
carbamates
(150–160 ppm),
carbonates
(145–165 ppm),
acids
(160–180 ppm), esters (160–170 ppm).
2.3. Main features of carbon dioxide reactivity
The MOs most relevant to the chemical reactivity of carbon
dioxide
are
the
doubly
occupied
non-bonding
1pg
orbitals
(HOMOs), mainly localized on the end oxygen atoms, and the
empty antibonding 2pu orbitals (LUMOs), mostly centered on the
carbon (Fig. 3). Therefore, CO2 can be considered an amphoteric
molecule, as it can act as an acceptor of electrons at the C-atom
(through the LUMOs) and a donor of electrons via the O-atoms
(through the HOMOs).
Electron poor centers (electrophiles such as the proton, metal
centers in high oxidation state, and electron deﬁcient molecules)
are expected to attack CO2 at the O-atom. Noteworthy, CO2 dis-
plays a weak basic character, as demonstrated by the value of pro-
ton afﬁnity of this molecule (Eq. (5)). The commonly accepted

value of 540.5 ± 2 kJ/mol [29] is markedly lower than those found
for other O containing molecules, such as H2O, MeOH, Me2O,
H2CO, MeCHO, Me2CO, HCO2H, MeCO2H.

The electrophilic character of carbon dominates over the weak
nucleophilic properties of the oxygen atoms. Consequently, CO2
is a better acceptor than donor of electron density. Electrons and
electron rich species will easily interact with CO2 at the C-atom.
This reactivity is exempliﬁed by the direct non metal-mediated
reactions of CO2 with electron rich anionic or neutral species such
as, for instance, H (Eq. (6)), OH (Eq. (7)), amines (vide infra).

Reaction of ionic (Group 1 or 2) hydrides with CO2 to afford the
relevant formate (Eq. (5)), albeit known since long time, has never
found any practical application for the synthesis of formates, which
are more conveniently synthesized by reaction of CO and the metal
hydroxides.
The reaction of CO2 with ionic metal hydroxides [M(OH)n]
(Eq. (7)) involves the nucleophilic attack of the anion (OH) to
the electrophilic carbon of CO2 [30]. The interest for this reaction
is linked to its utilization for the separation of CO2 from ﬂue gases
[31] or for the ﬁxation of CO2 into inorganic carbonates (Eq. (8))
that are under consideration for the safe long-term storage of
CO2 [32,33].

The reaction of CO2 with basic amines is of particular interest,
being exploited not only for up-taking CO2 from a gas stream,
but also for synthetic purposes [34–36]. The reactivity of amines
with CO2 depends on their nature and the working conditions.
Under strictly anhydrous conditions, tertiary aliphatic amines do
not absorb CO2, but aliphatic primary and secondary amines do
and form the corresponding ammonium carbamates (Eq. (9))
[34,35] or the relevant carbamic acid (Eq. (10)) which may be
stabilized in a dimeric form through intermolecular hydrogen
bonding, both in solution [37] and in the solid state [38]. Carbamic
moieties play a key role as intermediates in several biological
processes,
such
as
carboxylations
by
biotin
enzymes
and
photosynthetic activation of CO2 promoted by RuBisCO (ribulose
1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxidase) [39].

Different mechanisms have been proposed for the conversion of
amine and CO2 into alkylammonium carbamate [40], which may
involve the intermediate formation of a zwitterionic species
(Scheme 1) [41], or take place through a termolecular single step
(Scheme 2) [42]. Base B in Schemes 1 and 2 is the amine itself
under anhydrous conditions, but in an aqueous medium such role
may be played by H2O or OH. Whatever may be the working
mechanism, the key feature of the carbamation process is the
attack of the electron rich amine to the C-atom of CO2.
CO2 displays its amphoteric character in the reactions with frus-
trated Lewis pairs (FLPs) (Scheme 3) [43–46].
The interest for FLPs as potential systems for activating the
heterocumulene has markedly grown in the last few years [47].
Remarkably, B/N, B/P, or Al/P based FLPs can also effect the stoi-
chiometric or catalytic reduction of the activated CO2 moiety upon
treatment with an appropriate reducing agent such as hydrobo-
ranes or hydrosilanes [48–50]. Hydroboration and hydrosilylation
of CO2 to methoxyboranes and methoxysilanes, respectively, are
of signiﬁcant academic interest, but remain costly processes with-
out industrial utility. Of greater interest, in this context, may be the
use of a reducing agent such as H2 [51], which is known to be
heterolytically activated by several FLPs. To date, this intriguing
ﬁeld is still poorly investigated, but requires greater attention as
it may open perspectives toward the metal-free (or organic) cat-
alytic reduction of the heterocumulene.
2.4. Interaction of carbon dioxide with metal centers
The reactivity patterns outlined above can be recognized easily
when considering the behavior of CO2 as a ligand or, more
generally, the interaction of CO2 with metal centers. Despite the
signiﬁcant advances achieved since the isolation and X-ray charac-
terization of the ﬁrst metal–CO2 complex [52], this ﬁeld still repre-
sents a challenging research area. Basic studies on this topic are

welcome and new knowledge may be of fundamental importance
for potential exploitation. In fact, most reactions based on the uti-
lization of CO2 are driven by metal systems. Understanding the
interaction of the cumulene with metal centers, as well as the reac-
tivity of coordinated CO2, may be of great help in developing new
catalysts for CO2 conversion.
2.4.1. CO2 coordination to metal centers
The basic coordination modes of CO2 to a single metal center are
shown in Fig. 6 [53,54].
They reﬂect in a clear way the ability of CO2 to act as a pure
C-electrophile, (g1-C coordination), or O-nucleophile, linking the
metal through oxygen (g1-O or end-on coordination), or also to
act as an acceptor and donor of electron density, interacting, thus,
with the metal center through the C and O atoms, as in the case of
side-on (g2-C,O) coordination. The mode of bonding of CO2 to
metal centers has been extensively reviewed [52–54], therefore
we discuss here only selected cases, which can be relevant to
catalytic processes.
Side-on coordination represents by far the most common
bonding mode of CO2. In [Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2] (Cy = cyclohexyl) [55],
the ﬁrst crystallographically characterized metal–CO2 complex,
the NiAC and NiAO1 bond distances are, respectively, 1.84 and
1.99 Å, showing that both carbon and one of the oxygen atoms
are
bound
to
the
nickel
center,
which
exhibits
a
planar
coordination.
The coordinated CO2 molecule looses the original D1h symme-
try, typical of the free ligand: the measured lengths for the CAO1
and CAO2 bonds (Fig. 7) are, respectively, 1.22 and 1.17 Å, while
the value of the OCO angle is 133. The deviation of the coordinated
CO2 molecule from linearity is well in accordance with the features
foreseen considering the Walsh diagram.
Examples of bis(carbon dioxide) side-on complexes are also
known, but only with molybdenum. An example is provided by
trans-Mo(CO2)2HN(CH2CH2PMe2)2(PMe3) [56]. The complex has a
distorted octahedral geometry with two staggered CO2 ligands
g2-C,O-coordinated to Mo. The CO2 ligands show CAO lengths
ranging from 1.199 to 1.284 Å and OCO angles of 131.
The
dinuclear
complex
[(IPr)Ni]2(l-CO)
(l-g2,g2-CO2)
(IPr = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene)
docu-
ments an interesting case of a l2-g2,g2-coordination, in which
each C@O bond of the bridging CO2 ligand is, respectively, side-
on coordinated to a Ni atom [57] (Fig. 8). In principle, side-on
adducts may be considered as three-membered oxametallacycles
resulting from a formal oxidative addition of one of the p-bonds
of the CO2 ligand to the metal center or as p-complexes, wherein
the metal–CO2 interaction involves both electron donation from
the O-centered 1puy(5a1) and 1pgy(4b2) orbitals of CO2 to empty
d-orbitals of M and, at a greater extent, electron back-donation
from a ﬁlled d-orbital of metal to the empty C-centered 2puy(6a1)
orbital of the ligand [58].
This point is relevant to the deﬁnition of the oxidation state of
the metal center M: is it zero, one or two? However, whatever
model may be followed, in these systems the CO2 ligand always
acts simultaneously as electron-donor through an end oxygen
and electron-acceptor at the central carbon. The ability of CO2 to
act as a bifunctional system is further documented by the plethora
of CO2 complexes in which the cumulene bridges two or more
metal centers through carbon and one or both oxygens [52–54].

complexes with the metal centers bound to O and C.

Rh(diars)2(Cl)(CO2) (diars = o-phenylene-bis(dimethyl)arsine) pro-
vides an example of the behavior of CO2 ligand acting as a only-
C-electrophile (Fig. 9) [59]. Rh is essentially octahedral with the
CO2 ligand trans to chlorine and interacting with the nucleophilic
metal center through the central carbon (g1-C coordination). In
the adduct, the C-O distances, 1.20(2) and 1.25(2) Å respectively,
are longer than in the free cumulene, while the OCO angle is
126. The above structural data indicate an important pouring of
electron density from metal into the empty antibonding 2pu(6a1)
orbital, which weakens the CAO bonds and causes a remarkable
bending of the coordinated CO2 molecule (Fig. 4).
g1-C coordination has been claimed or demonstrated also in a
few other Rh, Ir and Ru complexes [60–62]. Generally, g1-C com-
plexes are less stable than g2-C,O complexes and are regarded as
reversible carriers of carbon dioxide. The stability of the MAC bond
strongly depends on the donor properties of the metal center. Often
g1-C complexes can be further stabilized by an intramolecular
hydrogen bonding interaction between the O-atom of CO2 ligand
and hydrogen donor centers [63]. As discussed below, the interac-
tion with external Lewis centers may also occur. It is worth noting
that such an interaction may play a key role in stabilizing adducts of
CO2 also with non-metal species. In 1,3-dimethylimidazolium-2-c
arboxylate,
obtained by
reaction of
1-methylimidazole
with
dimethyl
carbonate
[64],
the
imidazolium
C-carbene
binds
CO2 at C by using the free couple of electrons. The resulting
C ? CO2 moiety is formally similar to the M ? CO2 system: in the
solid adduct, the carboxylate moiety is stabilized through the
interaction of the nucleophilic O-atoms with the imidazolium-
ring hydrogens. In the last two decades, the chemistry of
N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) with CO2 has received great atten-
tion and NHCs and related complexes offer interesting perspectives
as potential systems for capture, ﬁxation, and activation of CO2 [65].
End-on (g1-O) coordination mode has remained elusive for a long
time. Only more recently, a few genuine examples of isolated and
structurally characterized adducts in which CO2 acts exclusively as
an O-nucleophile (g1-O or end-on coordination) have been
described in the literature [66–69].
The
uranium-complex
(AdArO)3tacnU(g1-OCO)
((AdArO)3
tacn =
1,4,7-tris(adamantyl-5-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzyl)1,4,7-
triazacyclononane), obtained by reacting the complex (AdArO)3
tacnUIII with CO2 has provided the ﬁrst evidence of (g1-O) coordi-
nation [66,70]. The OCO moiety is almost linear (OCO angle = 178)
with the terminal CO bond length (1.277(4) Å) longer than the
internal CO bond distance (1.122(4) Å). The structural data show
that, when CO2 behaves exclusively as an O-nucleophile, the coor-
dinated CO2 molecule essentially retains its original linear geome-
try or undergoes only slight distortion from linearity, as expected
when there is not a signiﬁcant back-donation of electron density
into the 2pu orbitals of the heterocumulene.
Examples of l-g1(O), g1(O) coordination have been also
described and structurally characterized [68,69]. In these systems
the CO2 molecule bridges two distinct metal centers through the
end O atoms as shown in Fig. 10. Systems of particular applicative
interest are represented by a few polyoxometalate anions, such as
for instance (H2PMo11CoO40)5, which reacts with aqueous CO2
affording the CO2-adduct (C3H5N2)3(C3H4N2)(PMo11CoO38(CO2))
4H2O, where CO2 is (l-g1,g1) coordinated through the end oxygen
atoms [69]. This compound consists of (PMo11CoO38)n polymeric
chains bridged by the almost linear CO2 ligand (OCO angle: 158)
in an axial direction. Such behavior is of great interest as it opens
an intriguing perspective on the use of polyoxometalates as CO2
capturing agents in aqueous medium.
Further insight in understanding the reactivity of CO2 with
metal centers comes from the study of the interaction of the CO2
molecule with ‘‘naked” metal atoms in a gas matrix at low temper-
ature (<20 K). FTIR spectroscopy and density functional theory
(DFT), are helpful in discovering their behavior [71], the most fre-
quently observed reactions being the formation of a metal complex
and the insertion into one the C@O bonds, depending on the nature
of the metal [72], i.e. its oxophilicity.
For instance, early transition metals (strong oxophiles) exhibit a
different behavior relative to late transition metals [71,72]. Ti, V
and Cr (or early transition metals, in general) insert spontaneously
into one of the C@O bonds yielding oxo-carbonyl species OM(CO)
even without energy barrier (Ti), while Fe, Co, Ni, Ag and Cu (late
transition metals)] form 1:1 M(CO2) adducts in which the cumu-
lene may display different coordination modes, depending on
metal. A side-on bonding was found for Ni, an O-end-on for Cu, a
g1-C for Fe and Co. Noteworthy, in a few cases, the same coordina-
tion modes were found for ‘‘naked atoms” and the relevant metal
complexes, which is not a general rule as the ancillary ligands L
may signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the behavior of the metal center
toward CO2, inﬂuencing the electron density and governing the
space availability [70].
2.4.2. Reactivity of coordinated CO2
Coordination of carbon dioxide to a metal center produces
marked changes of the structural and spectroscopic (IR, 13C NMR)
properties of the cumulene (loss of linearity; elongation of C@O
bonds; shift of the IR frequencies and 13C NMR resonance) [73].
The question rises whether coordinated CO2, in whatever form in
metal–complexes, can be considered an activated form with
respect to the free molecule, and, thus, which are the effects of
coordination on the reactivity of the cumulene and if there is a pre-
ferred mode of bonding for the conversion of CO2. Also, one can ask
whether spectroscopic data can be informative about the mode of
bonding of the cumulene and can, thus, be used for predicting its
reactivity. The rationalization of the whole matter is far from hav-
ing been accomplished and further fundamental studies are still
necessary. Another intriguing issue that must be addressed when
investigating the reactivity of CO2–metal complexes in solution is
relevant to the ‘‘ﬂuxionality” of the bonded cumulene: does CO2
maintain the same mode of bonding in solution as in the solid state
for a given adduct? This key aspect has been addressed only in a
very few cases. For instance, 31P and 13C VT NMR studies carried
out on [Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2] have allowed to conclude that in solution,
at 173 K, carbon dioxide is bonded to Ni as in the solid state, but at
room temperature carbon dioxide is ﬂuxional with an intramolec-
ular motion that, most likely, involves the disanchorage of the car-
bon atom from nickel (Fig. 7, bottom) to afford an g1-O
intermediate [74]. Such ﬂuxionality makes the two phosphines
equivalent in solution at room temperature, which are not equiva-
lent in the solid state (Fig. 7).
In principle, coordinated carbon dioxide can undergo either
electrophilic or nucleophilic attack. In general, the C-atom of CO2
bound to a metal in the g1-C or g2-C,O-coordination mode is
expected to be less prone to react with nucleophilic species than
the free molecule. However, if g1-O-coordination of cumulene is
considered, then the nucleophilic attack at C should be a more
likely process. However, reactions of CO2 complexes with nucle-
ophiles are poorly documented in the literature and knowledge
in this ﬁeld is very lacunose. A nucleophilic attack has been pro-
posed to be working in the Wittig-like reaction of (PCy3)2Ni(g2-
CO2) with Me3P = CH2 ylide to give the ketene complex (Cy3P)2Ni
(g2-C,O)-CH2CO and Me3PO [75]. This reactivity is relevant to the

formation of CAC bonds and opens a question about the necessity
to have a coordinated CO2 because a CAC coupling may occur.
Electrophilic attack is better documented. Both g1-C and side-
on coordinated CO2 have been shown to display an enhanced reac-
tivity at oxygen toward electrophiles and electrophilic attack is the
prevalent reactivity of CO2-bridged complexes with alkali cations
[60,76–78].
Of great interest is the protonation of coordinated CO2, which
may occur under very mild conditions (<273 K) and affords CO as
product. The electrons required for the reduction of CO2 to CO
are provided by the metal (Eq. (11)), which is oxidized, or may
be furnished by an external source.
LnMðCO2Þ þ 2Hþ ! LnM2þ þ CO þ H2O
ð11Þ
The utilization of PhSH as source of protons and electrons in the
reaction with (PCy3)2Ni(g2-CO2) has been demonstrated, providing
an interesting biomimetic system [79]. Unfortunately, in this sys-
tem CO remains tightly bound to Ni and diphenyldisulﬁde adds
oxidatively to Ni(0) to give P2Ni(SPh)2 (Eqs. (12)–(14)). These
events prevent the reduction process to proceed catalytically with
respect to nickel.

The above process (Eq. (11)) is strictly related to the more gen-
eral reaction of ‘‘dissociative reduction of CO2 to CO” (Eq. (15)).
This is the simplest way to convert CO2. The process is very energy

intensive, and, can be carried by a thermal (a high T > 1200 K) or a
radiative route (using high energy radiations, <160 nm). As shown
in Fig. 11a, this process is of great applicative interest if energy from
natural sources other than fossils fuels (for instance concentrators
of solar power, CSP) are used, as the formed CO, in turn, is both
an energy source and a synthetically exploitable source of carbon.
A cyclic process that runs on CO2–CO couple and makes use of
perennial energy sources (solar energy) as energy input is very
appealing. Metal oxides (Eqs. (16) and (17)) are under considera-
tion as catalysts for such reaction using concentrators of solar
power (CSP) that allow to operate at high temperature. When
CO2 splitting is coupled with water splitting using CSP, it is possible
to produce Syngas (plus oxygen) from CO2 and water, and, thus,
liquid fuels by Fischer Tropsch.

ð17Þ
This high-temperature catalytic splitting is of great importance
for the exploitation of CO2 and H2O as source of Syngas for the pro-
duction of ‘‘solar liquid fuels” (methanol, DME, gasoline, diesel).
CAO bond cleavage with consequent formation of CO and O
transfer to an ‘‘oxophile” is a reaction frequently observed for
g2- and g1-C CO2-complexes. The effect of coordination to a metal
is evident as the ‘‘deoxygenation” of CO2 can be performed even at
room temperature using the suited metal center and an ‘‘oxophile”.
Formed CO is often found coordinated to the metal center. The oxo-
phile acts as oxygen sink. Both these features contribute to drive
the dissociative reduction of CO2 to the right. The role of O-sink
may be played by the metal atom itself (Eq. (18)) [80], or with less
oxophilic metals (late transition metals, for instance) by CO2 itself
(Eq. (19)) [81] with conversion of two CO2 molecules into CO e
CO3
2, or by a ligand. For instance, phosphines, PR3 [55], can be con-
verted by this way into their oxides (O = PR3) (Eq. (20)), products of
very limited utility and difﬁcult to reduce back to the parent com-
pounds if not using energy intensive reducing agents (metals)
which cancel out the beneﬁt of having the CO2 splitting running
at room temperature.

In principle, the deoxygenation process can be coupled with the
production of useful chemicals, for instance by using as the oxo-
phile a suitable organic substrate (‘‘Sub”, in Fig. 11b). Such applica-
tion may be limited by the market of the species ‘‘Sub = O” that can
be generated. Suitable O-acceptors may be oleﬁns (Eq. (21)) as
their ‘‘oxidized” forms (epoxides) may have wide market as mono-
mers for polymers. Eq. (21) is not a straightforward process and
may occur if mediated by metal oxides as catalysts in a two-step
process: transfer of O-atom from a metal oxide to the oleﬁn [82]
and reoxidation of the reduced oxide with CO2.
ð21Þ
The epoxide can react with CO2 to afford a cyclic carbonate. To
date, this process, although of interest, has been demonstrated
only at the laboratory scale.
The use of CO2 as soft and selective oxidant has been demon-
strated in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to afford styrene
(Eq. (22)) [83].

ð22Þ

ð23Þ
C6H5ACH2CH3 ! C6H5ACH@CH2 þ H2
ð24Þ
As H2O and CO can be processed to afford H2 and CO2 (WGS)
(Eq. (23)), the net reaction is represented in Eq. (24) in which
CO2 acts as ‘‘promoter” of the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
favoring milder conditions and higher selectivity with respect to
pure dioxygen.
Currently the role of CO2 as a soft oxidant has been extended to
oxidative coupling of methane to ethane and ethylene and oxida-
tive dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons (such as propane
to propene) and there is still a lot of scope for its use in other reac-
tions [83].

2.4.3. Relevance of CO2 coordination to chemical utilization of CO2.
Synthesis of formic acid
The use of CO2 as synthon in chemical synthesis for manufactur-
ing bulk or ﬁne chemicals has been pursued since the 1980s. A key
issue is the relevance of CO2 coordination in such processes: is CO2
coordination a strict prerequisite for its conversion? An answer can
be given only by mechanistic studies on reactive systems. Any a
priori attempt to foresee the behavior of reactive systems is a pure
guess. The thermal lability of CO2 complexes and their tendency to
dissociate coordinated CO2 may add complexity and uncertainty to
the problem. As an example, let us consider the reaction of
(PCy3)2Ni(CO2) with dioxygen: the product would be the peroxo-
carbonate (PCy3)2Ni(CO4) (Eq. (25)) and one would foresee that
reaction (25) may proceed via O2 insertion into the NiAC bond of
the g2-C,O form.

Detailed mechanistic studies have shown that it proceeds
instead through carbon dioxide decoordination, dioxygen coordi-
nation to Ni, and CO2 insertion into the OAO bond of the newly
formed, reactive (PCy3)2Ni(O2) complex [84]. Interestingly, using
the (PPh3)3RhCl(O2) complex and labeled O2 and CO2 species
(16O2, 18O2, 16O2
12C, 18O2
12C, 16O2
13C) it has been conﬁrmed using
FTIR and NMR studies that the formation of the peroxocarbonate
moiety occurs via CO2 insertion into the OAO bond more than into
the RhAO bond of the dioxygen-Rh complex [85].
However, whether or not the coordination of CO2 is a prerequi-
site for further reaction depends on the kind of reaction CO2 has to
undergo. For sure, coordination to a metal center is necessary if the
reduction of CO2 to CO is considered (via O-transfer or protonation
at O). In other cases, CO2 pre-coordination to metal centers may
not be necessary, as discussed later on.
The insertion reactions of CO2 into MAE (E = H, C, N, O, etc.) bonds
are key steps of stoichiometric processes and catalytic cycles
implying CO2 incorporation into organic substrates with the gener-
ation of a new EAC bond. Often these reactions are initiated by
nucleophilic attack of E (in MAE) at the electrophilic carbon of
CO2 and assisted by weaker interactions between the metal center
and the lone pairs of one of the O-atoms of the cumulene.
This is the case of the insertion of CO2 into MAO bond of metal-
hydroxo (LnMAOH) and metal alkoxo (LnMAOR) complexes. The
insertion reaction of CO2 into a covalent polar MAOH bond affords
a hydrogen carbonate species (Eq. (26)) that can be stable or can
react further. This reaction is strictly related to the conversion of
CO2 into anionic or coordinated HCO3
 and the elusive acid
H2CO3, a transformation that plays a key role in the respiratory
process of humans and animals. The Zn-enzyme Carbonic Anhy-
drase (CA) can accelerate the reaction of hydration-dehydration
of CO2, facilitating, thus, CO2 up-take at cellular level and elimina-
tion in lungs from where it is expulsed [86]. It is now recognized
that this enzymatic process implies the nucleophilic attack of a
Zn2+-bound hydroxyl group at free CO2, which is held in place by
hydrogen bonds within the pocket of the active site of the enzyme.
The reaction of CO2 with M-OR (R = alkyl, aryl) bonds affords a
metal-alkylcarbonate moiety (Eq. (27)) and has an industrial inter-
est as it is related to the synthesis of molecular organic carbonates
and polycarbonates based on the direct carboxylation of substrates
such as alcohols, polyols and epoxides. A variety of LnMAOR com-
plexes have been investigated and also tested as catalysts in

synthetic chemistry and co-polymerization processes [87–89]. The
transition state of such reaction can be represented as in Fig. 12
and implies the interaction of the electrophilic C of CO2 with the
oxygen of the OR group [90,91]. Preliminary coordination of CO2
to the metal center is not necessary in this class of reactions.
The insertion of CO2 into the MAN bond of metalAamido com-
plexes (LnMANR2) generates a new CAN bond and affords
metalAcarbamato complexes, which are important intermediates
in the synthesis
LnMAðNR2Þ þ CO2 ! LnMAO2CNR2
ð28Þ
of carbamate esters, isocyanates, amides [34,35,92]. Also this pro-
cess does not require, as a preliminary step, the coordination of
CO2. In fact, the reaction can proceed via attack of free CO2 to the
nitrogen atom of metal–amido-complex [93]. However, because of
the aptitude of metal–amides and metal–carbamates to hydrolyze,
it is possible also an amine-catalyzed mechanism summarized by
reactions (29) and (30) [94]. Trace amounts of amine can be fortu-
itously present in solutions of M(NMe2)n compounds as a result of
M(NMe2)n hydrolysis due to adventitious water. Under the working
conditions (CO2 in excess relative to amine), the free amine can
interact with the heterocumulene to produce carbamic acid R2-
NCO2H, which reacts as shown in Eq. (30).

According to the above mechanism the formation of the metal
carbamate complex should be better regarded as a ligand substitu-
tion, rather than a true insertion process. This reaction pathway
has been largely exploited from the synthetic point of view for
the preparation of a great number of metal carbamate adducts
(Eq. (31)) [34,35].

The CO2 insertion into a MAH or MAC bond can occur according
to two different modes, which are usually designated as ‘‘normal”
and ‘‘abnormal” mode (Scheme 5) [54,95,96].
The observed insertion mode depends on the charge separation
in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which may be critically affected by the
nature of the metal itself and the ancillary ligands. The ‘‘normal”
insertion mode affords metal-formates (E = H) or, more generally,
metal-carboxylates (E = C), while the ‘‘abnormal” mode generates
a metalla-carboxylic acid (E = H) or a metalla-ester (E = C). Such
insertion reactions are important steps in stoichiometric or cat-
alytic processes leading to the synthesis of carboxylic acids and
carboxylate esters.
To date, very little is known about the ‘‘abnormal insertion” path
for which only a few claims exist [54,95,96]. The MACO2H species

is proposed [97] to be present and active in several processes
implying MH-species and CO2, but a clear-cut demonstration of
CO2 insertion into the MAH bond of a transition metal complex
to afford M-CO2H is not found in the literature. Conversely,
MACO2H species have been generated by chemical or electro-
chemical protonation of MACO2 complexes, either g2-C,O or g1-C.
The reactivity of ‘‘MAH/CO2” systems has reached high levels of
attention because of its relevance to reactions that may have
industrial interest such as the hydrogenation of CO2 to afford for-
mic acid (Eq. (32)) and the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to
other C1 or C1+ molecules.

What is the role of CO2 coordination in this insertion process
(Scheme 5, (a); E@H) has been matter of several theoretical and
experimental studies. Both paths represented in Scheme 6 are
possible, depending on the nature of the metal center [98–100].
The nature of the reaction medium may also play a key role in inﬂu-
encing the mechanistic pathway [100]. However, the whole matter
still waits for a full rationalization.
The direct synthesis of HCO2H from CO2 and H2 catalyzed by tran-
sition metal systems has much been investigated in the last twenty
years. The interest toward such a process is mainly due to the
potential of formic acid as hydrogen-carrier, as the two reactions,
(i) carbon dioxide hydrogenation using molecular dihydrogen
and (ii) decomposition of formic acid into the starting carbon diox-
ide and dihydrogen, give a quasi-CO2-neutral cycle. Currently,
worldwide production of formic acid, obtained from the combina-
tion of methanol and carbon monoxide with a strong base, is in the
order of 0.8 Mt/y and is used in the textile industry, cleaning and as
a preservative. Demand could increase markedly due to the devel-
opment of efﬁcient formic acid dehydrogenation catalysts that
could ﬁnd widespread application within the context of a hydrogen
economy [101].
A limitation of the approach is the unfavorable thermodynamics
of reaction (32). However, the formation of formic acid is more
favorable in a condensed medium such as water (Eq. (33), DG
 = 4 kJ mol1), where the CO2/H2CO3/HCO3
 equilibrium as well
as the second deprotonation to CO3
2 must be taken into account,
or if a base is used that produces formate salts instead of free
formic acid, (Eq. (34), DG = 35 kJ mol1) [102].
Under the latter conditions the actual substrate is HCO3
 or CO3
2
rather than CO2.

Another drawback is the kinetic stability of the intermediate
hydrido-formate species LnMH(OCHO): breaking of the MAO and
MAH bonds can represent the real kinetic barrier to the process.
Overcoming
the
above
kinetic
and
thermodynamic
barriers
requires the use of a ‘‘shuttle”. Either Group 1 metal cations are
used for the extraction of the formate moiety, or amines which
are able to extract H. This has for long time prevented the exploita-
tion of carbon dioxide hydrogenation as a catalytic direct route to
free HCO2H despite catalysts have been developed that have a high
TON (several millions) and TOF [103,104] toward the salt. In fact,
either the ammonium- or the Group 1 metal-formate that are
produced need treatment with inorganic acid (such as H2SO4) for
the production of the free acid. Such acid treatment produces
equimolar (relative to HCO2H) amounts of waste inorganic salts.
Very recent reports have opened interesting perspectives about
the possible exploitation of the direct synthesis of free formic acid
from CO2 and H2 in acidic media, without the need of any bases,
amines or buffers. Lawrenczy has shown that it is possible to pro-
duce free formic acid by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide by carry-
ing out the reaction in water or DMSO, without using any additive,
in the presence of Ru-catalysts (RuCl2(1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaada
mantane) and other related ligands) [102].This ﬁnding represents
a breakthrough in this ﬁeld and can open the way to an exploita-
tion of the reaction.
Oxidative coupling reactions of CO2 with unsaturated molecules
X@Y (Scheme 7), such as oleﬁns, dienes, cumulenes, alkynes,
g2-aryne, nitroso- or diaza-compounds and hetero-oleﬁns (imines,
carbodiimides, azadienes or aldehydes) [7,54,73,105–113], are key
steps toward the functionalization of the above substrates.
These reactions generate a new CAY bond (Y = C, N, O), and
open an alternative route, in addition to the insertion reactions,
to the incorporation of the heterocumulene into a variety of new
carboxylated products (acids, esters, lactones, pyrones, etc.), often
characterized by complex molecular structures largely used in the
production of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, etc.
The coupling reaction is promoted by a low-oxidation state
transition metal center (Ni, Mo, Fe, Mn, Pd, Rh, Pt, etc.), which
undergoes oxidation, and affords a ﬁve-membered metallahetero-
cycle, as shown in Scheme 7(a). Remarkably, in the known exam-
ples, the oxygen of carbon dioxide more than the C-atom binds
to the metal (Scheme 7(b)).
The relevance of CO2 coordination in such processes is another
open issue, which has been addressed in detail only in a few cases.
In principle, the above couplings can take place through one of the
routes (i)–(iii) below:

The head-to-tail CO2 homocoupling at the Ir center of IrCl(C2O4)
(PMe3)3 (Scheme 8) necessarily implies the intermediacy of a
CO2-Ir adduct and may follow pathway (a) [81]. However, the
mechanistic details are not known. The reaction is believed to be
initiated by the nucleophilic addition of IrCl(C8H14)(PMe3)3 to
CO2 (O(3)C(2)O(4)), with the resultant more nucleophilic oxygen
(O(3)) binding a second CO2 molecule (O(2)C(1)O(1)) through C
(1). Cyclization via IrAO(1) bond formation affords the product.
Pathway (b) has been documented experimentally for the
oxidative
coupling
CO2/propionaldehyde
[112]
(X@C,
Y@O;
Scheme 7) and CO2/isoprene (X@Y@C; Scheme 7) [113] at a Ni(0)
center for which the activation parameters have been measured
(DH = 43 ± 6 kJ/mol
and
DS = 129 ± 19 J/mol K
[112];
DH = 25 ± 7 kJ/mol; DS = 184 ± 24 J/mol K [113], respectively).
Several examples of oxidative coupling CO2/oleﬁn or CO2/alkyne
have been reported [7,105,106,114,115]. To date, the hypothesis
that coordinated CO2 might react with free alkene/alkyne to gener-
ate a metalla-lactone has not found sound experimental support.
For instance, despite Ni(0)-complexes are very effective in promot-
ing the oxidative coupling of CO2/oleﬁn, Aresta et al. found that Ni
(CO2)(PCy3)2, in the solid state, did not react with gaseous ethene
even after three hours at room temperature. In solution, a substitu-
tion reaction occurred easily with formation of Ni(PCy3)2(C2H4)
[7,74,116], showing that ethene is more tightly bound to ‘‘Ni
(PCy3)2” than CO2. Accordingly, earlier DFT calculations carried
out for the systems ethene/CO2 [117] and alkyne/CO2 [118,119]
in the presence of Ni(0) bearing N-donor ligands, ruled out that
the oxidative coupling of CO2 with the above substrates (alkene/
alkyne) at Ni(0) may involve the interaction of a NiACO2 complex
with the unsaturated substrate used (Eq. (35b)) or proceed through
an associative mechanism involving the intermediate formation of
a ‘‘mixed” substrate-carbon dioxide Ni-complex (Eq. (36c)). The
calculations indicate that the coupling reaction involves the activa-
tion of the oleﬁn by coordination at the metal center and the sub-
sequent reaction of the activated substrate with an incoming CO2
molecule (Eq. (36b)), as shown by previous experiments [116].
However, suitably changing the nature of ancillary ligands or
metal center may open new mechanistic pathways and, for
instance, shift the mechanism of oleﬁn/CO2 oxidative coupling
toward pathway (c) (Eq. (36c)). For instance, a theoretical work
supports that oxidative coupling ethene-CO2 at nickel centers bear-
ing bidentate phosphorous ligands can proceed through sequential
coordination of ethene and CO2 to Ni with formation of an ethene–
CO2–Ni-complex LNi(C2H4)(CO2), wherein, however, CO2 is only
weakly bound to Ni [120]. Pathway (c) was originally postulated
by Carmona for the reaction of trans-M(C2H4)2(PMe3)4 with
CO2
affording
the
binuclear
hydrido-acrylate
complex
l-(CH2@CHCOO)2[HM(C2H4)(PMe3)2]2 (Scheme 9) [121].
DFT calculations (carried out for M@Mo) have conﬁrmed the
consistency of the mechanism illustrated in Scheme 9 [122].
Coordination of CO2 molecule to the metal center with formation
of the CO2-bis-ethene complex Mo(C2H4)2(CO2)(PMe3)3 is a neces-
sary step to achieve the CO2-alkene coupling, because the formation
of the new CAC bond is promoted by a simultaneous metal ? CO2
and metal ? C2H4 electron donation mechanism. The formation
of the metalla-lactone species is, thermodynamically, allowed and
the activation barrier has been estimated to be 11 kcal/mol. The
ﬁve-membered metallacycle converts into a metal-hydride species
through an exothermic b-hydrogen transfer step showing a calcu-
lated energy barrier of 10 kcal/mol. The hydrido-acrylate monomer
is already well below the energy of the reactants, but further stabi-
lization is achieved through the dimerization process.
The mechanism of ethene carboxylation at a Mo center has been
investigated also experimentally [123], following the conversion of
trans-(triphos)Mo(C2H4)(N2)2
(triphos = (Ph2PCH2CH2)2PPh)
and
CO2
into
the
bridging
acrylate
hydride
complex,
[(triphos)
MoA(H)(OC(O)CH@CH2)]2 (Scheme 10). The observation of the
intermediate complex (triphos)Mo(C2H4)(CO2) on the path to
CAC bond formation (Scheme 10) provides the ﬁrst experimental
evidence that simultaneous coordination of both ethene and car-
bon dioxide at a metal center is a prerequisite for coupling the
two unsaturates. This behavior is somewhat different from what
described to occur at nickel centers. It has been suggested that
the requirement of precoordination of both CO2 and oleﬁn, while
being less stringent for late transition metal centers like Ni, may
be more likely for early transition metal centers.
However, at present, generalizations may be rash. Knowledge in
this ﬁeld is still lacunose and further studies are required to fully
elucidate, for a given M/X@Y/CO2 system, the role of the metal cen-
ter and ancillary ligands in marking the mechanistic pathway of
the coupling reaction.
3. Conversion of CO2 into chemicals
3.1. CO2 as a C1-synthon for the synthesis of ‘‘intermediates and ﬁne
chemicals”
The incorporation of carbon dioxide into organic substrates tells
in a clear way the huge potential of the cumulene as C1-synthon
for the synthesis of ﬁne and commodity chemicals [36,124–130].
These reactions allow to build up new CACO2AH, CACO2AC,
EACO2 (E = N, O) moieties and lead to the direct carboxylation of
the organic substrate with formation of new products such as car-
boxylic acids, esters, lactones, carbamates, and carbonates. Such
synthetic approach is of great importance from the industrial point
of view as the target products have a large market of the order of
several Mt/y. Moreover, the exploitation of such synthetic method-
ology would allow the implementation of more direct or safer syn-
thetic routes in place of those on-stream that do not respond to the
energy- or atom-economy principles or make use of toxic and
harmful starting materials such as phosgene, opening thus, and
intriguing new perspectives of development of a more sustainable
chemistry. In fact, with respect to processes on stream, the utiliza-
tion of CO2 for the synthesis of carboxylated compounds bears
several beneﬁts such as: reduce the production of waste, recycle
carbon, and make less use of solvents if supercritical CO2 (scCO2)
is used as solvent and reagent. Because of the more direct syn-
thetic approach, there may also be a lower energy consumption.
Such beneﬁts may be accurately evaluated by using the LCA

methodology, applied to the CO2-based process and to the process
that is being substituted [131].
One can foresee that in general, the energetics of the carboxyla-
tion processes will be acceptable, the energy required for CO2 con-
version being contributed by the co-reagent, which is an electron-
rich species. This is the case of carboxylation reactions in which the
carbon atom maintains the formal +4 oxidation state, as in carba-
mation or carbonation reactions (Fig. 1). To such processes, those
bearing to the formation of carboxylates RCOOH(R) (e.g., acids,
esters, and lactones), in which the C-atom has an oxidation state
of +3, can be added. Also these reactions may be thermodynami-
cally feasible but, at least in a few cases, they may show some ther-
modynamic or kinetic constraints.
In the following sections special attention will be devoted to
compounds such as carboxylic acids, esters, lactones, carbamates,
isocyanates, ureas, carbonates, due to their industrial importance.
3.1.1. Oxidative coupling with oleﬁns: synthesis of acrylic acids and
acrylates
As previously emphasized (Section 2.4.3), CO2 and oleﬁns can
react in the presence of a suitable metal center and form a
metallacyclo-carboxylate (A) (Scheme 11). Such species have been
isolated and characterized in a number of cases [54,73,110].
Scheme 11 shows two possible ways through which, in principle,
(A) may further react, once formed. Formation of b-lactone, which
may form from
by reductive elimination, has
never been observed experimentally. On the other hand, the
metalla-lactone may generate, through a b-H shift reaction, a
metal-hydrido-acrylate species (B).
Species like (B), which have been isolated (M = Mo, W) and fully
characterized [121,123], have drawn great attention for their
potential as precursors of acrylic acids RHC = CH2C(O)OH which,
in principle, might be generated by reductive elimination. Acrylic
acid is the simplest unsaturated carboxylic acid and is a building
block for hundreds consumer products. The global acrylic acid
market was valued at $11006.6 million in 2013, and it is estimated
to reach $18824.0 million by 2020, growing at a rate of 7.6% during
the forecast period (from 2014 to 2020) [132]. The global con-
sumption of acrylic acid is anticipated to reach 8169.0 kt by
2020. Acrylic acid, CH2@CHCO2H, is used in a number of industrial
applications. The primary use of acrylic acid is in the production of

is in the production of supersorbent polymers.

ates, water treatment chemicals, and water absorbent polyacrylic
acid polymers. It is currently manufactured at an industrial scale
by two-stage oxidation of propene (Eq. (37)), a byproduct of hydro-
carbon cracking and naphtha reﬁning. This process employs hetero-
geneous catalysts consisting of metal oxides such as vanadium and
molybdenum to oxidize propene to acrolein in the ﬁrst step.

The synthesis of acrylic acid based on the direct combination of
ethene with CO2 (Eq. (38)) is, in principle, a very attractive alterna-
tive as it is 100% atom economical as all the atoms of the reactants
are found in the target product.
Hoberg [133], in the early 1980s, ﬁrst reported the (sub)stoi-
chiometric formation of cinnamic acid, PhCH@CH2C(O)OH, from
styrene and CO2, in the presence of Ni(cod)2 and DBU. Since then,
the catalytic synthesis of acrylic acids by direct coupling of oleﬁns
with CO2 has greatly attracted the interest of chemists. However, to
date, this goal still remains unaccomplished. In fact, going back to
Scheme 11, either (A) or (B) may be stable species which prevent
spontaneous release of acrylic acid. Theoretical and/or experimen-
tal
studies
[122,123]
support
(see
Section
2.4.3)
that
the
conversion of the ﬁve-membered metallacycle (A) into the metal-
hydride species (B) at a Mo or W center is a both thermodynami-
cally and kinetically accessible step, but the hydrido-acrylate
monomer (B) does not eliminate acrylic acid, probably because of
the barrier of the cleavage of the MAH and MAO bonds. On the
other hand, the body of experimental evidences suggests that in
Ni(0) promoted CO2-oleﬁn coupling reactions the metallacycle
structure (A) (Scheme 11) is a thermodynamic sink, as a nickela-
lactone was usually found to be the ﬁnal product. A more recent
attempt to liberate acrylic acid from a nickelalactone was based
on the use of a basic phosphane, such as 1,2-bis(diphenylpho
sphino)methane (dppm). However, a molecular rearrangement
took place bearing the cleavage of PAC bonds and the formation
of stable acrylato-complexes [134]. Aresta and coworkers have ﬁrst
modeled using DFT the reaction of ethene with CO2 over ‘‘L2Ni” and
shown that the formation of the acrylic acid occurs in three main
steps passing through the facile formation of the pentaatomic met-
allacycle ring, which is in a well of energy that prevents on Ni a
facile last step, i.e. the b-H shift. Moreover the elimination of
acrylic acid has also a barrier [117]. Later on, Buntine and cowork-
ers [135] have investigated the reactivity of Ni(cod)(DBU)2 using
DFT. The calculations showed again three main steps for the pro-
cess: exothermic formation (17.2 kJ/mol) of the ﬁve-membered
nickelacycle
by
oxidative
coupling;
endothermic
b-H
shift
(+21.3 kJ/mol)
resulting
in
a
nickel-hydrido-acrylate
species;
endergonic
reductive
elimination
of
acrylic
acid;
(see
also
Scheme 11). The three steps exhibited substantial energy barriers
(respectively: 121.8 kJ/mol; 147.4 kJ/mol; 104.1 kJ/mol), but in
the opinion of the authors, not so large that would prohibit the
overall catalytic process. Thermodynamic in addition to kinetic
constraints may also prevent the overall reaction from taking place
at a signiﬁcant extent, in accordance with the solvation-corrected
Gibbs free energy of the coupling reaction in question, which
was calculated to be unfavorable by +42.7 kJ/mol [135]. In this
regard, it may be of interest to note that acrylic acid has been
reported to react with ‘‘Ni(cod)2” (1 equiv) in the presence of
PCy3 (1 equiv) to give the nickela-lactone species Cy3PNi(CH2CH2-
C(O)O) [136].
The reductive elimination of acrylic acid from a hydrido-acrylate
metal complex closely resembles the previously discussed elimina-
tion of formic acid from hydrido-formate metal complexes LnM(H)
O2CH. In the latter case, the elimination process is facilitated by
using an appropriate ‘‘shuttle” of the formate anion (amine or
Group 1 metal cations). The use of K+(Na+) shuttle has been inves-
tigated by Limback [137,138] who has reported the ﬁrst catalytic
(also limited to a few cycles) formation of CH2@CHCOOM (M = K,
Na) by using Ni(0) catalysts in presence of MOH (Scheme 11). A
variation to this approach has been proposed by using excess
Zn-powder to reduce Ni [139]. This process uses more than 2e
per mol of acrylic acid (considering the loss of Zn used in excess),
being less effective than the electrochemical generation of acry-
lates carried out in the 1993s [140]. The role of Lewis acids has
been also investigated [141,142], and the activity of Pd systems
has been explored [143].
Recent advances have opened new perspectives in this research
area. The topic of coupling ethene-CO2 has recently been faced fol-
lowing a new synthetic approach aimed at avoiding the contempo-
rary formation of MAH and MAO bonds and driving the system
toward the formation of a metallorganic species of the type
MCH2CH2CO2R,
which
easily
eliminates
the
acrylato
ester
CH2@CHACO2R via a b-H shift with generation of a MAH species.
With the use of a Pd catalyst it has been shown that the elimina-
tion of the acrylate ester is an easy reaction and the catalytic for-
mation of such ester was described, however limited to a few
cycles [144]. The correctness of such strategy is further supported
by a few recent results which describe the formation of methyl
acrylate by methylation of nickela-lactones with MeI [145,146].
The latter results merit attention as they conﬁrm that alkyl esters
of acrylic acids can be released more easily than the corresponding
acids from nickela-lactones.
A question may come to the mind of the reader: can CO2 be
co-polymerized with oleﬁns to afford polyesters (Eq. (39))? If one
considers the skeleton of the product (A) obtained by coupling an
oleﬁn with CO2 (Scheme 11), under which circumstances would
it be possible to insert an oleﬁn molecule into the MAO bond of
(A), followed by another CO2 molecule and so on?
nCO2 þ nRCH@CHR ! A½CHRACHRACðOÞOnA
ð39Þ
Such alternate insertion of oleﬁn and CO2 has not been experi-
mentally documented so far. It is useful to recall that alkynes are
able to insert a second alkyne in the skeleton of the product of
oxidative coupling of CO2 and the alkyne (Scheme 12 and 18; vide
infra 3.1.4). The insertion does not give an ester linkage as it occurs
on the MAC bond rather than on the MAO bond. The product of
coupling is then eliminated as a pyrone. The coupling of the oleﬁn
with CO2 is more difﬁcult than the coupling of the alkyne. Such
reaction may have a large industrial interest and is worth investi-
gating also if it is foreseeable that a perfect alternate insertion will
not be easily reached, and the insertion of CO2 will be statistical
and will not reach the level of insertion of CO as in the case of
ethene/CO.
3.1.2. Synthesis of other carboxylic acids by oxidative coupling CO2 and
oleﬁns
The formation of a terminal ‘‘carboxylic moiety” CACO2 is
achieved through a variety of routes such as oxidation of hydrocar-
bons or aldehydes (obtained from oleﬁns by hydroformylation),
base catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols, carbonylation reac-
tions often coupled with H2O addition (Koch reaction; Reppe
chemistry), oxidative cleavage of oleﬁns by ozonolysis or using
H2O2

acid- or base-catalysis, carbonation of a Grignard or organolithium
reagents. In some cases the synthetic methods are poorly selective
or not quantitative, and in other cases they may imply multistep
procedures with production of wastes and loss of carbon [116].
In this ambit the development of direct catalytic carboxylation of
organic substrates would be of great value and applicative interest.
As previously noted, unsaturated substrates such as oleﬁns,
alkynes, [54,73,105,106,109,110,147,148] allenes [106,149] and
conjugated dienes [73,105,106,118,119,150–155] can react with
CO2 in the presence of a suitable metal center in a low oxidation
state through an oxidative coupling reaction, which provides an
entry into a variety of metal-carboxylated species. Although most
of such reactions at the moment are stoichiometric, they can play
a signiﬁcant role from the synthetic point of view as they are direct
and clean routes to functionalized unsaturated carboxylic acids or
alkyl esters, which can be released stoichiometrically upon simple
protonolysis or acidolysis in the presence of alcohols.
3.1.2.1. Functionalization of alkynes, allenes and conjugated dienes.
Ni(0) is very effective in promoting the oxidative coupling of alkynes
or allenes with CO2. Scheme 12 shows the formation of carboxylic
acids produced by hydrolysis of the metallacycle. Such route uses
catalysis for the coupling of the unsaturated substrate with CO2,
but the metallacycle does not undergo spontaneous elimination,
as already seen with acrylates. Acidolysis is necessary for recover-
ing the carboxylic acid. Such syntheses have been achieved in the
1993s by electrocatalysis [156,157], which again is not catalytic
as sacriﬁcial electrodes were used and the carboxylated product
was recovered as Mg-salt, in general. Making such processes cat-
alytic would be of great importance.
Stoichiometric carboxylation of conjugated dienes with CO2 has
been carried out in the presence of both late and early transition
metal complexes. Depending on the nature of the metal center,
ancillary ligands, diene substrate, and, more generally, working
conditions, the carboxylation reaction may evolve in different ways
and afford metal-carboxylic products implying 1:2 or 1:1 or 2:1
CO2/1,3-diene coupling, which are useful synthones for further
reactions with electrophiles. For instance, in the presence of mon-
odentate P-ligands, Ni(0) promotes the CO2/1,3-diene coupling in a
1:2 ratio to yield a Ni(II)-C9-carboxylate.
This behavior reﬂects the well recognized ability of Ni(0)-
complexes bearing labile phosphane ligands to promote oleﬁn
oligomerization. In thes carboxylation reactions the dimerization
of the diene to form a bis-allyl-C8 chain is followed by CO2 inser-
tion into a Ni-allyl r-bond to afford Ni(II)-carboxylates, which
may undergo further rearrangement reactions. CO2/diene coupling
in
a
1:1
ratio
to
give g3-allyl-C5-carboxylate
Ni-complexes
(Scheme 12) has been shown to be promoted in the presence of
P- or N-chelating ligands [106,154]. Although g3-coordination of
the allyl moiety is thermodynamically more stable compared to
the g1-bonding mode, an g3–g1 rearrangement of the oxo-p-
allyl intermediate formed by diene-CO2 oxidative coupling is also
possible and can be envisaged to account for the formation of a,
x-dicarboxylate complexes, which have been reported in a few
cases (Scheme 12; M = Fe [151], Zr [152], Ni [153]). Remarkably,
only 1,4- and no 1,2-dicarboxylation have been observed. More
recently, this stoichiometric chemistry has received new impulse
[158–160] and has, for instance, been applied to the synthesis of
highly functionalized carboxylic acids, such as a-methylene-c-hydr
oxy carboxylic acids [158] and their derivatives, or exploited for
the preparation of b-hydroxycarboxylic acid derivatives [159].
The synthetic valence of the reactions described above is out of
discussion, but their stoichiometric character may represent a lim-
itation to their exploitation. The moment being they can be applied
on a small scale or for the synthesis of high added value chemicals
of complex structure. The stoichiometric nature of these processes

can be related with the thermodynamic and/or kinetic stability of
metalla-lactones or Cn-carboxylate metal-complexes intermediate
products as discussed above (Scheme 12).
Driving catalytically the carboxylation of the above substrates is
not an easy task. This goal may be achieved through a judicious
choice of the metal center, the ancillary ligands and the experi-
mental conditions. For instance, in the presence of Ni(0), switching
from PPh3 to less basic P(O-i-Pr)3 ancillary ligand allowed to obtain
2-methylene-3-vinylcyclopentanecarboxylic acid from butadiene
and CO2 even catalytically, albeit in low yield and with a low turn-
over (TON = 29) [153]. Unfortunately, to date, this remains a rare
example of such an approach.
Nowadays, new synthetic strategies have given new impulse to
the research in this area opening new perspectives in the use of the
heterocumulene as carboxylating agent of unsaturated organic
substrates. These approaches exploit the reactivity of a suitable
co-reagent able to reduce back the catalyst from Ni(II) to Ni(0).
At the end the catalytic center can be recycled, but a reduced form
of a metal (Zn, Al) is oxidized. Such approach may have sense if the
catalyst is a precious metal, less with Ni. The fact that another
metal is in any case oxidized in stoichiometric amount leaves
doubts about the correctness of using the term ‘‘catalytic” in such
applications, and leaves on such reaction the label of ‘‘trans
metalations” or ‘‘syntheses assisted by metals”.
Alkyl- or aryl-zinc reagents, acting as alkylating(arylating)/trans
metalating agents, have been used to push catalytically (in the
sense
discussed
above)
the
carboxylation
of
alkynes
[161]
(Scheme 13) or bis 1,3-dienes [162,163] in the presence of Ni(0).
The unsaturated carboxylic acids can be liberated from the
relevant Zn carboxylated salt by protonolysis.
According to a different approach organozinc reagents have
been used as reducing/transmetalating agents for addressing
catalytically the carboxylation of unsaturates, such as styrenes
(Scheme 14) [164] or internal alkynes [165], in the presence of
Ni(0) catalysts, through a hydrocarboxylative pathway which
allows
to
bypass
the
formation
of
a
classic
Hoberg-
type
oxanickelacycle.
Such hydrocarboxylative approach has been successfully applied
to the carboxylation of internal alkynes by using Cu catalysts and
hydrosilanes as hydride transfer agents [166], and for the synthesis
of b,c-unsaturated carboxylic acids from allenes [167,168] or
1,3-dienes [169] and CO2. A new hydrocarboxylating system has
been used, based on a tridentate silyl pincer palladium catalyst
precursor (X = triﬂuoromethanesulfonate in Scheme 15) and AlEt3
(or ZnEt2).
A mild and user-friendly Ni-catalyzed regioselective hydrocar-
boxylation of alkynes with CO2 (0.1 MPa) has been also described
which uses Mn as reducing agent and simple alcohols as proton
sources [170].
A common feature of the carboxylation reactions discussed
above is the utilization of a coreactant (ZnR2, HSiR3, AlR3, etc.; usu-
ally used in excess with respect to the unsaturated substrate),
which is consumed to regenerate the catalytically active species
(LnNi(0); LnMAH) after each cycle. Therefore, as already discussed
above, all these processes are catalytic with respect to the transi-
tion metal (Ni, Cu, Pd, etc.), but not with respect to the co-
reagent, which is used in excess and generates waste at the end
of the process. Features like the energetic cost of the species used
in transmetalation (metal alkyls are quite intensive in energy) and
the metal waste generated in the ﬁnal step of acidolysis, contribute
to increasing the E-factor and decreasing the environmental sus-
tainability of these syntheses. Nevertheless these reactions provide
a powerful versatile tool for the direct synthesis of complex
organic molecules functionalized with carboxylic acid moieties,
which, otherwise, would be produced through multistep proce-
dures. Further progresses in this area are expected through the def-
inition of cheaper and cleaner reducing agents and enlarging the
portfolio of used unsaturated substrates. LCA should be used for

key issues in the reaction so to ﬁnd a remedy and make such inter-
esting reactive systems suitable for the direct carboxylation of
organic substrates.
3.1.3. Carboxylic acids by CO2 incorporation into C-H bonds
The direct CH carboxylation with CO2 provides another poten-
tial route to carboxylic acids (Eq. (40)). The process formally
involves the insertion of CO2 into a CAH bond. The enthalpy of such
a reaction can be easily calculated as it is given by the following
quantities: DHr = [H(CAC) + H(OAH)]  H(CAH).
For
different
sub-
strates major differences can be found in the values of H(CAH) and
minor for H(CAC). The entropic content of the reaction is due mainly
to the fact that gaseous CO2 is at the end found in a liquid or solid
form. The DS will be negative so that the term TDS will be posi-
tive. The DG will depend mainly on the entropic content and the
overall reaction will have a positive Gibbs free energy change,
making the concentration of the acid quite low at the equilibrium.
The carboxylation of methane or benzene (Eqs. (41) and (42))
exempliﬁes the situation at 298 K.

Various metallorganic reagents, usually obtained by the direct
metalation of a CAH bond (as well as by reacting an organic halide
with a metal compound), have been used for a stoichiometric
carboxylation of organic substrates [171,172]. Also phenoxide
anion (C6H5O) g5-coordinated to transition metal centers, such
as Mn(II) [173] or Rh(I) [174], has been shown to selectively
activate the para-CAH bond of the aromatic ring and, upon CO2
ﬁxation, convert into the 4-OH-benzoic acid. Such carboxylation
reactions are reminiscent of the for long time known carboxylation
of Grignard’s reagents and are stoichiometric processes as they
require 1 mol of metal per mol of organic product and should be
regarded
as
‘‘metal-assisted”
carboxylations.
This
feature
represents a limitation making unlikely the application of these
processes on a large scale.
Catalytic carboxylation of CAH bonds has been claimed to occur
in presence of an active CAH bond. However, 2-dialkyl-imidazo
lium-carboxylates bearing CO2 bonded at the heterocarbene moi-
ety have been shown to be able to act as CO2-carrier and transfer
CO2 to activated CAH bonds (Eq. (43)) [175]. The catalytic carboxy-
lation of CAH bonds of heteroaromatics HetH has been carried out
in presence of the system [(IPr)AuOH]/KOH (IPr = (1,3-bis(diisopro
pyl)-phenylimidazol-2-ylidene) (Scheme 16) [176].

Regeneration of the [(IPr)AuOH] catalyst from the intermediate
gold carboxylate [(IPr)Au(O2CHet)] is accomplished by K+ cation
acting as a shuttle of the carboxylate moiety. NHC–Cu complexes
have also been used [177,178]. When common aromatic com-
pounds (benzene derivatives) are used, the carboxylation occurs
quite efﬁciently only if electron deﬁcient groups are present in
the ring, indicating that the CAH bond must be strongly activated
(acidic CAH bonds) in order that the carboxylation may occur
[179].
Therefore, the acidity of the CAH bond of the substrate repre-
sents a limitation in these processes, although it can be modulated
by controlling the substituents in the organic substrate. However,
this constrain may limit the number of potentially usable sub-
strates which can afford carboxylated products that may not be
of general use.
In principle, the interaction of the substrate with a suitable ”ac-
tivating system”, such as a metal system, may provide another way
to enhance the activity of a CAH moiety. This approach is by far
more appealing as it can lead to several products of industrial
use. Such direct functionalization might be very useful with short
chain HCs (C1AC4) that do not ﬁnd a convenient use today.
Recently, direct carboxylation of simple arenes under atmospheric
pressure of CO2 has been achieved through a rhodium-catalyzed
CAH bond activation without the assistance of a directing group,

using AlMe2(OMe) [180] or AlMe1.5(OEt)1.5 [181] as reductant. Var-
ious arenes such as benzene, toluene, xylene, electron-rich or
electron-deﬁcient benzene derivatives, and heteroaromatics have
been directly carboxylated with high TONs [181]. Also in this case
the catalytic center (Rh) is regenerated at expenses of Al, another
less expensive and more common metal, but the E-factor of such
synthesis is quite high making it suitable for limited applications.
Photocatalysis may offer interesting perspectives in this area.
Recently, the direct insertion of CO2 into the CAH bond of acacH
(actylacetone) has been shown to occur under photocatalysis
(Scheme 17) [182]. The species identiﬁed as the initiator of the
reaction is the CO2
. radical anion. It extracts a H-atom either from
the enolic form or from acacH itself. Coupling of COOH with the
acac-radical affords the acid. Interestingly, under photocatalysis
two different isomeric acids are obtained that imply the CO2 inser-
tion into the activated methylenic CAH bond but also into the
more inert CAH bond of the terminal ACH3 moiety, that under
chemical catalysis is not affected [183].
Such approach has been used also for the photocarboxylation of
2,3-dihydrofuran (2,3-DHF) to afford 25% yields 2,3-DHF-2-COOH
[184]. Noteworthy, the photocatalytic approach works in water
and affords the free acid and not the salts as seen in other cases
above. This feature makes the photocatalytic approach of great
interest.
To date, catalytic carboxylation of CH bonds still remains a chal-
lenging research area, which deserves more research efforts. The
only industrial exploitation of reaction (40) is still provided by
the Kolbe–Schmitt synthesis of hydroxybenzoic acids [185] carried
out by reacting CO2 with Group 1 salts of phenol under severe con-
ditions. Noteworthy, also this industrial synthesis is not a catalytic
process as 1 mol of Group 1 metal (Na or K) is used per mol of phe-
nol. It would be interesting to convert it into a catalytic process
using phenol more than phenolates. The direct carboxylation reac-
tions are of great importance, and their exploitation may have
favorable impact on the chemical industry allowing the synthesis
of several large market products (for instance, acetic acid, benzoic
acid, long chain fatty acids, dicarboxylic acids) through less tortu-
ous and more C-efﬁcient routes.
3.1.4. Synthesis of linear and cyclic esters from unsaturated
hydrocarbons
Under suitable conditions, CO2 and unsaturated organic sub-
strates (alkynes, allenes, conjugated dienes and others) can be
cooligomerized catalytically. These processes open new perspec-
tives in the synthesis of industrially relevant classes of compounds,
such as cyclic and linear esters, by direct reaction of CO2 and unsat-
urated substrates. Nevertheless, so far, these transformations have
not been widely developed and in most cases are still far from
exploitation.

[190,191]. 2-Pyrones are used in organic synthesis and medicinal
chemistry as a building block for more complex chemical struc-
tures because they may participate in cycloaddition reactions to
form bicyclic lactones. Moreover, 2-pyrone structure is found in
numerous natural products isolated from plants, animals, marine
organisms, bacteria, fungi, and insects that exhibit a broad range
of biological activities, such as antifungal, antibiotic, cytotoxic,
neurotoxic and phytotoxic. A variety of synthetic methodologies
of 2-pyrones have been developed and have been recently
reviewed [192].
Scheme 18 summarizes the generally accepted mechanism of
the Ni-catalyzed formation of pyrone.
The ﬁrst step of the catalytic cycle is the formation of oxanick-
elacyclopentenone A, as already discussed. This intermediate can
insert another alkyne molecule into the NiAC(sp2) bond to afford
the oxa-nickel-acyclo-heptadienone B, from which the pyrone pro-
duct is liberated by reductive elimination. Dedicated studies have
ruled out the hypothesis that pyrone formation might imply the
preliminary coupling of two alkyne molecules to form a nickelacy-
clopentadiene complex, followed by CO2 insertion into the NiAC
bond or [4 + 2] cycloaddition to a CO2 molecule. On the contrary,
nickelacyclopentadiene species are involved as intermediates only
in the undesired side-reaction of alkyne cyclotrimerization. In this
area Ni-based systems still continue to be among the most effec-
tive catalysts. Other metal catalysts (Co [193] and Rh [194] com-
plexes) are less active and less selective because of collateral
substrate cyclo-oligomerization. Heterogeneous catalysts have
been explored only sparingly [195].
3.1.4.2. Catalytic cooligomerization of allenes and CO2. Also allenes,
CO2-like molecules, can be cooligomerized with CO2 in the pres-
ence of transition metal (Pd, Rh, Ni) catalysts [196–200]. To date,
this topic has received only moderate attention. Yields in carboxy-
lated products are generally low to modest because of signiﬁcant
incidence of the undesired oligo- and polymerization of the
substrate.
The reaction of allene with CO2 in the presence of Pd [196] or Rh
[197] catalysts yields linear and cyclic esters (A–C; Scheme 19). An

unprecedented reaction has been observed by reacting allene with
carbon dioxide in the presence of trans-[RhCl(C2H4)P(i-Pr)3]2 as
catalyst and controlled amounts of H2, used to repress the allene
head-to-tail polymerization side-reaction [200]. In fact, under
strictly controlled experimental conditions, [RhCl(C2H4)P(i-Pr)3]2
promoted, albeit in low yield, the formation of four-membered lac-
tone 3-methylene-2-oxetanone (D, Scheme 19), which is the pro-
duct of formal [2 + 2] addition of allene to CO2 [201]. This
product has never been observed when allene is reacted with
CO2 in absence of H2. Such four membered systems are usually
obtained by converting acrylates with singlet O2 in the presence
of PPh3 as acceptor of unrequired oxygen [202]. The synthesis of
the four membered lactone by direct reaction of allene and CO2
is noteworthy and remains a unique evidence of coupling to afford
the isomeric form of ketene.
3.1.4.3. Catalytic cooligomerization of conjugated dienes and CO2.
-
Conjugated dienes can be cooligomerized with carbon dioxide
in the presence of various transition metal (Pd, Ni, Ru, Rh) catalysts
[110,203,204]. Most studies have concerned 1,3-butadiene as the
reference substrate. The telomerization of 1,3-butadiene with
CO2 can afford a variety of carboxylated products in addition to
products of substrate homocoupling. In the presence of Pd, Ru, Ni
catalysts d- and c-lactones such as 2-ethylidene-6-heptene-5-
olide, 2-ethylidene-5-heptene-4-olide and its conjugated isomer
2-ethyl-2,4-heptadiene-4-olide can be obtained together with
smaller amounts of linear esters (Scheme 20). Carboxylic acids
may also be found among the products, depending on the experi-
mental conditions. The formation of these species requires, as a
preliminary step, the coupling of two butadiene molecules before
carboxylation occurs [110,205]. However, Rh-catalysts promote,
albeit with low yield (5–8%) and TON, the formation of c-lactone
2-ethyl-2,4,9-undecatriene-4-olide in which three molecules of
butadiene are coupled before CO2 insertion occurs (Eq. (44))
[206,207].
ð44Þ
Many efforts have been devoted to shed light on the conditions
favoring the formation of d-lactone 2-ethylidene-6-heptene-5-
olide (Scheme 20) [110,207]. Interesting yields and selectivities to
the d-lactone have been obtained by using catalytic systems based
on Pd(acac)2 and phosphines with good r-donor properties and
bulky substituents, such as P(i-Pr)3 or PCy3. The presence of nitrile
groups in the reaction medium (nitrile solvents) markedly facili-
tates the formation of the d-lactone. Nitrile ligands may stabilize
the catalytically active Pd(0)/phosphine system through the forma-
tion of a labile Pd(NCR)x(PR3)y complex that can more easily gener-
ate free coordination sites for the coordination of diene. Based on
this ‘‘nitrile-effect”, new hemi-labile phosphino-nitrile ligands, R2P
(CH2)nACN, have been designed and prepared which increase the
versatility of the catalytic system allowing to carry out the catalytic
process in solvents other than nitriles or also in solvent-free condi-
tions (‘‘CO2-expanded” butadiene, that ensures an easier recover-
ability of the products and a lower environmental impact of the
process) [208].
Organic carbonates have also been investigated as solvent
alternative to acetonitrile [209]. Cyclic carbonates, such as ethene

carbonate, propene carbonate, butene carbonate and glycerol car-
bonate, facilitate the formation of d-lactone much more than linear
carbonates, such as dimethyl- or diethyl carbonate, with selectivi-
ties depending on the structure of the carbonate.
Strategies have been developed for catalyst recovery using
1,2,4-butanetriol or employing immobilized catalysts that show
conversions and selectivities close the homogeneous systems
[209–211]. To date, the synthesis of d-lactone has been developed
to miniplant scale [210]. The selectivity to the d-lactone has been
increased above 95% by recycling of by-products, reaching an over-
all butadiene conversion of 45%. Moreover, also solvent, unreacted
starting materials, and catalyst can be recycled affording a stable
process which is ready for industrial exploitation. The d-lactone
is a richly functionalized molecular system which may ﬁnd practi-
cal utilization in numerous synthetic applications [212] of acids,
alcohols or diols, aldehydes, amino acids or amines, esters, silanes
and even polymers.
3.1.4.4. Carboxylation of strained rings: insertion into a CAC bond.
Strained rings can be carboxylated in the presence of transition
metal systems to give different products, which formally involve
the insertion of CO2 into a CAC bond. The reactivity depends on
the size of the ring, the metal used and the reaction conditions.
The carboxylation reaction proceeds stoichiometrically with Ni(0)
systems [213,214], as illustrated, for instance, in Scheme 21 for
the carboxylation of quadricyclane promoted by Ni(bpy)(cod)
(bpy = 2,20-bipyridine;
cod = 1,4-cyclooctadiene).
The
2-oxa-3-
nickelacyclohexanone complex, which can be isolated, is too much
stable to liberate the corresponding lactone in a subsequent reduc-
tive
elimination
step,
and
crystalline
endo-nortricyclane-3-
carboxylic acid can be obtained upon acid hydrolysis [214]. In
these cases, 1 mol of metal is consumed per mol of carboxylated
product formed, which is a serious drawback to the exploitation
of the process. Other cyclic three-membered hydrocarbons less
strained than quadricyclane, such as cyclopropane and norcarane,
were not carboxylated in the presence of Ni(0).
Catalytic incorporation of CO2 into a CAC bond of strained cyclic
hydrocarbons, such as cyclopropane and methylenecyclopropanes,
has been accomplished only in a few cases using Pd(0)- or Rh(I)-
based catalysts [215–217]. Although TONs are still very low, these
studies deserve attention as they open new perspectives in the
direct synthesis of lactones and furanones a class of products,
which ﬁnd interesting applications in pharmaceutical, cosmetics,
and foodstuff industry.
The
Rh-promoted
carboxylation
of
cyclopropane
to
c-butyrolactone (Scheme 22) is a light-driven reaction [217].
Noteworthy, the lactone is not produced thermally, probably
because the reduction of CO2 to CO with phosphine oxidation is
favored at higher temperatures. Formation of the carbonyl complex
RhCl(CO)(PMe2Ph)2 corresponds to the deactivation of the catalyst.
3.1.5. Synthesis of carbamates
The interaction of CO2 with amines, mediated or not by metal or
non-metal species, affords the carbamate moiety, ‘‘RR0NCO2”,
either ionic
or
covalently
bound to
an electrophilic center
[34,35,218–222].
Direct
interaction
of
CO2
with primary or
secondary amines affords carbamic acids or alkylammonium
carbamates (Eqs. (9) and (10)) [34,35,37,38]. In the presence of
metals, metal salts (Eq. (45)) [220,221] or metal-complexes
(Eq. (31)), amines and CO2 can afford metal carbamates [34,35].

Nowadays, this chemistry arouses great interest being relevant
not only to chemical syntheses but also to several technological
applications implying gaseous-CO2 [34–36], being the process
reversible. Amines (MEA, DEA, TEA, MDEA, etc.) and polymer-
bound amines are reusable ‘‘CO2 scrubbers”, used for removing car-
bon dioxide from industrial exhaust streams [36]. To this purpose,
multiple amine-containing dendrimers [223] and ionic liquids
[224] or Metal Organic Framework (MOF) incorporating ANH2
groups in their structure are also under evaluation [225,226].
Organogels [227] and supramolecular polymers have also been
prepared [228]. Computational studies have been carried out to
evaluate the parameters of the reaction [229]. More recently,
amine-CO2 systems have been employed for molecular imprinting
of polymers [230] and for preparing switching-polarity solvents
[231].
The reaction of CO2 with amines opens new perspectives to the
utilization of CO2 as a substitute of phosgene in organic synthesis.
In fact, the carbamate moiety ‘‘RR0NCO2”, once generated (see
above), can be transferred to a suitable organic substrate for the
synthesis of carbamate esters or also used as precursor of ureas
and/or isocyanates, providing an appealing eco-friendly alternative
route to the conventional synthetic technologies based on phos-
genation methods [34,219,232]. Carbamate esters ﬁnd application
in pharmacology as drugs or prodrugs [233] or as agrochemicals
[234]. Organic carbamates also play a key role in synthetic
chemistry as suitable intermediates and for protecting amino-
groups [235], or as linkers in combinatorial chemistry [236], or
as precursors of ureas, isocyanates and polymers [237–239].
The development of CO2-based routes to carbamates is not an
easy task. Carbamate moiety ‘‘RR0NCO2” is an example of ambident
nucleophile, at the O- and N-atoms. Carbamation of an electrophile
E (Scheme 23) requires the electrophilic attack by E to be
addressed onto one of the O-atoms (Scheme 23; (a)). Electrophilic
attack to the nitrogen atom (Scheme 23; (b)) causes elimination of
CO2 from the carbamic moiety and formation of undesired
alkylated amines as side-products (Scheme 23; (b0)).
The transfer of carbamate anion from a metal ion, p-block ele-
ment or an alkylammonium cation, to alkylating agents as alkyl
halides or dialkyl sulfates has been achieved only in a few cases
[34,35]. The reactivity of metal or ammonium carbamates can be
addressed toward O-alkylation by enhancing the O-nucleophilicity
of the anion through the use of a suitable complexing agent
(crown-ether, cryptand) able to coordinate the counter cation
[240,241]. Carbamate esters have been synthesized, under mild con-
ditions, from amine, CO2 and alkylating agents also in the presence
of sterically hindered strong bases, such as amidines, pentaalkyl-
guanidines, phosphazenes [242–244]. Basic systems have also been
studied [245,246]. The base can be generated even electrochemi-
cally by cathodic reduction of O2 to superoxide in the presence of
CO2 [247]. The electrochemical activation of CO2 to radical anion CO2
-
 in conventional solvents, or in ionic liquids, also promotes the for-
mation of carbamate esters from aromatic or aliphatic amines and
alkyl halides under mild conditions [248]. A variety of heteroge-
neous catalysts in the synthesis of urethanes from aliphatic and aro-
matic amines, CO2, and alkyl halides have been explored only quite
recently [249–252].
Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) has successfully been used for the
selective synthesis of carbamate methyl esters by reaction with ali-
phatic primary amines and CO2 [253–255]. Mechanistic studies
have shown that DMC behaves as a methoxycarbonylating rather
than as a methylating agent of the carbamate anion, which initially
forms by direct reaction of amine and CO2 (Scheme 24).
Labeling experiments with 13CO2 have allowed to demonstrate
that the resulting mixed anhydride, RNHC(O)OC(O)OMe, converts
into the carbamate product by releasing the 13CO2 molecule origi-
nally ﬁxed by the starting amine that is not incorporated in the
ﬁnal product. Therefore, CO2 in this process acts as a catalyst of
the methoxycarbonylation reaction of amine (Eq. (46)) [256–258].
With respect to the synthesis from amines, CO2 and alkyl
halides, the synthesis of carbamates from amines, CO2 and alcohols
(Eq. (47)) is not only a phosgene-free, but also a halogen-free pro-
cess. Moreover, water forms as the only reaction co-product. These
features make this route to carbamates very attractive from the
point of view of environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, the
studies in this ﬁeld are still very few [259–264]. Also, reaction
(47) requires a water tolerant catalyst in order to avoid deactiva-
tion. The use of suitable technique able to sequestrate the copro-
duced water may be a useful strategy to prolong the life of catalyst.

Recently, the one pot synthesis of organic carbamates from ami-
nes, CO2, and alcohols has been achieved with high yield, in the
absence of dehydrating agents, using CeO2 as a recyclable catalyst,
even in the absence of any additive [262].
The reaction of CO2 with 1,2-amino alcohols is a transformation
closely related to reaction (47) and provides a synthetic route to
cyclic urethanes, such as oxazolidin-2-ones [265–269]. This reac-
tion can take place even in the absence of any catalyst, but under
severe conditions of temperature and CO2 pressure [265]. Cyclic
carbamates can be obtained also by incorporation of carbon diox-
ide molecule into the aziridine ring [270,271]. This reaction repre-

Pd(0)-complexes [281], or Ni(Br)2(cyclam) under electrochemical

The transfer of carbamate moiety to epoxides may provide a
suitable entry into carbamic esters of 1,2-diols [284] or also oxazo-
lidinones [285].
Electrophilic activation of alkynes toward nucleophilic adducts
of CO2 with amines allows the catalytic incorporation of the hete-
rocumulene into enol carbamates [286]. The search of catalysts
able to promote the carbamation process selectively relative to
oligomerization of alkyne and with high stereoselectivity is a chal-
lenging task. Mononuclear Ru complexes have been shown to be
effective catalysts for the activation of terminal alkynes toward
ammonium N,N-dialkyl carbamates [287,288], even in sc-CO2
[289].
The reaction of functionalized alkynes such as propargyl alco-
hols with carbon dioxide and secondary aliphatic amines [290]
opens the way to the one step synthesis of O-b-oxoalkyl-N,N-dia-
lkyl carbamates (Eq. (48)). Reaction (48) can be actively promoted
by Ru-complexes [293,291] (R3 = H), lanthanide metal chlorides
[292] (R3 = H), iron-carbonyls [293] (R3 = H), cationic copper(I)
[294] (R3 = H), AgO2CCH3/DBU (R3 = alkyl) [295] and can occur
effectively in sc-CO2 even without any catalyst [296].

Primary amines react with propargylic alcohols and CO2 in a differ-
ent way to give cyclic carbamates, as oxazolidin-2-ones. The
process can be catalyzed by Cu(I) derivatives [297–299] or by a
tertiary phosphine such as tri-n-butylphosphine [300], or by
silver salts [301]. Cyclic carbamates such as 5-methylene-2-
oxazolidinones can be obtained also by reaction of propargylamines
with CO2 under metal (Cu [297], Ru [302], Pd [303], Ag [304,305]),
protic ionic liquid (PIL) [306] or base catalysis [307,308]. In sc-CO20
5-methylene-1,3-oxazolidin-2-ones have been prepared in good
yields from N-alkylprop-2-ynylamines and carbon dioxide even in
the absence of any metal or base catalyst [309]. An efﬁcient solvent
free synthesis of oxazolidin-2-ones via the cycloaddition of cheaper
terminal alkynes, primary amines, and CO2 has been recently
achieved under the catalysis of copper (I) iodide [310].
Carbamation of alkenes provides an appealing 100% atom eco-
nomical route to carbamic esters. Nevertheless, this reaction has
received very little attention. The transfer of carbamate moiety to
the C@C bond of oleﬁns has been documented only in very few
cases, using activated unsaturated substrates, such as ethyl vinyl
ethers (Eq. (49)) [311], allylamines (to give oxazolidin-2-ones)
[312], or allenylamines [313], or a few dioleﬁns in the presence
of a suitable metal center (Pd) able to activate the unsaturated sub-
strate through coordination (Scheme 25) [314].

ð49Þ
In the latter case, however, the carbamate ester is obtained sto-
ichiometrically relative to Pd and was liberated from the metal
after a ﬁnal quenching step involving reductive cleavage with
NaBH4 or H2 or also protonolysis with anhydrous HCl, as observed
for (DIPHOS)Pd(Cl)(nortricyclo urethane) (Scheme 25).
The latter result indicates that the PdAC bond in (DIPHOS)Pd
(Cl)(nortricyclo urethane) is too strong for protonolysis by ammo-
nium ion, but its cleavage can be more easily accomplished by a
stronger acid such as HCl.
The body of these ﬁndings deserves attention as they suggest
the possibility that, with a proper choice of the metal–ligand envi-
ronment, carbamation of oleﬁn may be carried out catalytically, as
illustrated in Scheme 26.
3.1.6. Synthesis of isocyanates
Isocyanates, RNCO, are industrially relevant compounds, which
ﬁnd application in several ﬁelds [315–317]. Many isocyanates are
starting materials for the manufacture of plant protection agents,
pesticides, dyes, resins and plastics, textile waterprooﬁng agents,
detergents, bleaches and adhesives. They are also widely used in
surface coatings such as paints, sealants and ﬁnishes, and in the
manufacture of rubbery plastics such as those used to coat wires.

production of polyurethanes. The global market for diisocyanates
in year 2000 was 4.4 Mt, of which 61.3% was methylene diphenyl
diisocyanate (MDI), 34.1% toluene diisocyanate (TDI), 3.4% the total
for hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and isophorone diiso-
cyanate (IPDI), and 1.2% was the total for various others. Currently,
the global isocyanate capacity amounts to 8.8 Mt and is scheduled
to increase by more than 3 Mt until 2020. The market is in expan-
sion by, on average, 4.5% per year [318]. The isocyanates market
value will grow to $38,729 million by 2019, at a signiﬁcant CAGR
from 2014 to 2019 [319]. Isocyanates may be prepared via a num-
ber of routes, but, to date, only amine phosgenation is practiced on
a signiﬁcant industrial scale [320].
The direct synthesis of isocyanates from carbon dioxide is a
challenging task. Building up of isocyanate group from CO2
requires the de-oxygenation of the heterocumulene [35,321]. The
reaction with isonitriles (Eq. (50)), in which carbon dioxide acts
as an oxidant of the organic substrate, represents an interesting
approach which, however, is limited by the availability of the sub-
strate and the low TON observed so far [322,323].

Direct synthesis from amines and CO2 (Eq. (51a)) is, in principle,

Researchers at Monsanto have studied in depth this process
using as coreagent a tertiary organic co-base (guanidines, phosp-
hazene, triethylamine) in the presence of dehydrating agents
(POCl3, PCl3, P4O10, SO3, SOCl2) [325]. In general, the reaction pro-
ceeds fast, with high yield, under mild conditions. However, the
use of large amounts of co-base and the production of large quan-
tities of waste makes the exploitation of this process on a large
industrial scale difﬁcult.
A clean route to isocyanates is the thermal treatment of primary
amines carbamates (Eq. (51b)) produced from amines and CO2. Such
route already ﬁnds some industrial exploitation when R0 = CH3.
3.1.7. Synthesis of ureas
Interest for ureas derives from their application in a wide vari-
ety of ﬁelds, as pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals and agrochemi-
cals
[238,239].
Ureas
are
used
as
dyes
for
cellulose
ﬁber,
antioxidants in gasoline, corrosion inhibitors, plant growth regula-
tors, agroprotectives (pesticides and insecticides), tranquillizing
and anticonvulsant agents. Unsymmetric ureidic group character-
izes several biologically active compounds, with activity as inhibi-
tors of HIV-1 protease or p38 kinase. Ureas are also useful
intermediates for the production of carbamates [326].
While the industrial synthesis of urea (NH2)2CO is based on the
reaction of ammonia with CO2 by dehydration of intermediate
ammonium carbamate [324], the conventional way to the synthesis
of symmetrically N,N0-substituted ureas is based on the reaction of
amines with phosgene [320,327]. The latter approach is less efﬁ-
cient for the synthesis of unsymmetrical ureas because of impor-
tant side formation of symmetrical ureas. Addition of amines to
isocyanates provides the main route to the synthesis of unsymmet-
rical substituted ureas. In the last few years, harmful phosgene and
isocyanates have been increasingly replaced with safer phosgene
equivalents, such as triphosgene, activated carbonates, carbonyldi-
imidazole, carbamoyl chlorides, chloroformates or also carbamates
[320]. However, most of them are still usually prepared from COCl2.
The utilization of CO2 in the synthesis of substituted ureas is an
intriguing alternative to classical phosgenation methods [34,328],
also if the attempts made so far have poor applicative interest.
The reaction of amines with carbon dioxide provides a direct
synthetic approach to ureas (Eq. (52)). This reaction is a reversible
process [329], which implies elimination of water (Eq. (52)).
Exploitation of reaction (52), without using auxiliary reagents
(such as condensating reagents), would have a great practical
signiﬁcance.

Very few catalytic systems have been explored so far. Interest-
ing results, mostly limited to the synthesis of symmetric or cyclic
ureas, have been obtained using RuCl3H2O/Bu3P [330], base cata-
lysts (CsOH/BMImCl[331]; [BMIm]OH [332]; CsOH, CsF, Cs2CO3
[329]), KOH/PEG1000 [333], MCM-41 and HMS-type mesoporous
silica [334], polymer supported nanogold particles [335] and, more
recently, Mg-Al layered double hydroxides (Mg-Al LDHs) [336] and
CeO2 [337].
3.1.8. Synthesis of acyclic carbonates
Molecular acyclic (Fig. 13a) and cyclic (Fig. 13b) organic carbon-
ates will experience a great expansion of their market during com-
ing years, due to their use in the chemical – (as solvent and reagent
[338]),
pharmaceutical
[339]
and
polymer-industry
[340]
(Figs. 14a and 14b).
Also, the lower members of the acyclic carbonate family,
namely dimethyl-carbonate (DMC), diethylcarbonate (DEC) or
dibutylcarbonate (DBC) have been evaluated as components of
gasoline [341], to which they can be added up to 5–10%, depending
on their O-content. It is, thus, foreseeable that their free market
(most of the DMC produced nowadays is for captive use in the
industry of polycarbonates: only ca. 10% reaches the free market)
may grow of more than two orders of magnitude from actual
0.1 Mt/y.
The direct carboxylation of alcohols (Eq. (53)) and the reaction
of alcohols with urea (used as an active form of CO2) (Eq. (54)) rep-
resent appealing alternatives to the use of phosgene or to more
recent synthetic methodologies based on the oxidative carbonyla-
tion of alcohols, mainly conﬁned to methanol, or on the use of less
conventional techniques (high speed ball milling (HSBM)) [342]. Of
the syntheses based on CO2, the former (Eq. (53)) has some kinetic
and thermodynamic barriers, the latter rises the issues relevant to
NH3 recovery and product separation.

A enthalpy change close to zero can be foreseen for most alipha-
tic alcohols, or positive for aromatic derivatives, such as phenols.
The OAH energy in alcohols and the OAR energy in the resulting
carbonates will thus inﬂuence the enthalpy of the reaction, while
the entropic content is mainly driven by CO2, which goes from
the gas phase into a liquid or solid product.
As a result of the unfavorable thermodynamics (Table 3), the
equilibrium concentration of the formed carbonate is quite low,
often around 1% or even less, depending on the reaction tempera-
ture that usually is in the range 400–450 K for the metal-catalyzed
reaction, or as lower as 335 K for peculiar systems (vide infra).
In the direct carboxylation, alcohols undergo, a priori, two dis-
tinct elementary reactions, as categorized in Scheme 27. In (i) an
alcohol molecule is converted by a base into an alkoxo-moiety that
interacts (ii) with CO2, affording the hemi-carbonate, ROAC(O)O.
A second molecule of alcohol is activated by an acid (iii) and pro-
duces
the
alkyl
cation
moiety
that
reacts
with
the
hemi-
carbonate (iv) and generates the dialkylcarbonate.
Homogeneous [343–347], immobilized [348–351] (Fig. 15),
heterogeneous catalysts [352–357] and organic catalysts [358]
have been used to drive Eq. (53). Each class presents its own pros
and cons. Immobilized catalysts are more easily recoverable than
the parent homogeneous compounds, but the choice of the support
requires attention [348,350]. In Fig. 15 the Sn active center [348] is
bonded to the polymeric matrix through a C2-tether: its direct link
to the aromatic ring would deactivate the catalyst.
The reaction mechanism [359] has been studied for a few
homogeneous catalysts and shown to be dependent on the metal
used. Route A in Fig. 16 is followed by Nb-complexes, for which
the pathway depicted in Scheme 27 holds, while Sn-complexes
follow an intramolecular Me-transfer (Fig. 16, middle route) not
found for Nb.
Interestingly, the key step in the formation of DMC with Nb is
the reaction of the hemicarbonate moiety with two moles of metha-
nol (Fig. 16, upper part) that allows the formation of water to take
part out of the inner coordination sphere of the metal. In this way
the active monomeric form of the catalyst is reformed. Conversely,
nBu2Sn[OR)(OC(O)OR] undergoes intramolecular Me-transfer with
formation of [nBu2Sn@O]n that needs re-activation [360–363].
Water removal for shifting equilibrium 53 to right and preserv-
ing the catalyst has been attempted using both chemical and phys-
ical means. Chemical traps are easily hydratable organic species
(acetals [364], ketals [365], cyanides [366] and imides) or inorganic
materials (zeolite-based materials). Zeolites need to be used at low
temperature (e.g., 240 K) [367] otherwise their acidic surface may
decompose the carbonates at the reaction temperature of >400 K.
This makes their use energetically questionable, as the tempera-
ture swing (>400 K ? 240 K ? 400 K) requires energy not always
(completely) recoverable and usable.
Moreover, zeolites need to be dehydrated with energy con-
sumption and possible loss of materials. Organic water traps have
the advantage that can be used at the same temperature of the
reaction and, as their hydration is exergonic by ca. 35 kcal/mol,
the overall reaction DG is negative, allowing the reaction of car-
boxylation of alcohols to occur at lower temperature with respect
to the metal catalyzed reaction (even room temperature) and with
much better yields. On the other hand, organic water traps suffer
several drawbacks, such as: i. they are used in excess with respect
to alcohol, ii. themselves and their hydrated forms are soluble in
the reaction medium that increases the post-reaction separation
processing with energy loss, and iii. they need to be recovered from
the reaction mixture and regenerated for re-use, otherwise their
stoichiometric use would make the entire process economically
non acceptable and the E-factor of the process would be very high.
Carbodiimides, e.g., CyN@C@NCy, have been used as water
traps [368], but later on [358] their role

as organic catalysts (Eqs. (56) and (57)) was ascertained and their
ability to carboxylate methanol and other alcohols at 335 K
described. Their peculiarity is that their hydrated form (i.e., the urea
RHNC(O)NHR, DCU) is insoluble in the reaction medium and can
easily be recovered. Interestingly, the conversion of DCU into DCC
has been achieved [369,370].
In order to avoid the complexity of chemical traps, a pervapora-
tion membrane
˛ (Fig. 17) technology has been developed [357] for
water removal that is quite simple and avoids post-reaction com-
plex operations. The unfavorable thermodynamics of the direct
carboxylation of alcohols has pushed to ﬁnd alternative routes,
based on CO2, for the conversion of alcohols into the relevant car-
bonates. Urea, formed from CO2 and NH3, can be considered an
active form of CO2 (Fig. 1).
Its formation DG is some 200 kJ/mol less negative than that of
CO2. However, the reaction of urea with alcohols would have a bet-
ter thermodynamics than the reaction of CO2 and, consequently,
the equilibrium position should be shifted toward right, reaching
higher conversion at the equilibrium. As a matter of fact, urea
has been used in several applications bringing the synthesis of car-
bonates from alcohols to the demo-plant level. The reaction mech-
anism has been studied by several authors [371–373]. Further
studies are still in progress for better understanding the potential
of such methodology that requires the recovery of ammonia for
reaching an economic acceptation [374]. The separation of the
reaction mixture remains a key issue. This ﬁeld has made progress
in the last decade and fundamental knowledge has been acquired
by combination of experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies.
Nevertheless further research is necessary for the up-scale of
processes to the industrial application.
3.1.9. Synthesis of cyclic carbonates
The
direct
carboxylation
of
diols
and
polyols
has
been
attempted using a variety of synthetic techniques since long time
with alternate success. Organic bases (15.3% conversion yield,
100% selectivity. Catalyst: TBD, 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0dec-5-en
e]) in presence of ammonium carbonate and acetonitrile as water
trap [375], and electrogenerated heterocyclic carbenes [376]
have shown interesting properties. Also in this case, there are
thermodynamic restrictions and water traps have been used to
shift the equilibrium. Recently, CeO2 has been used for the direct
carboxylation of propanediol to afford propene carbonate with
yields >60% in presence of 2-CN-pyridine as water scavenger
[377]. Glycerol (Scheme 28A) has also been carboxylated with
5.8% conversion yield at the equilibrium [378], close to the thermo-
dynamic value 6% [379].
Also in this case the use of urea as CO2 substitute has much
improved the syntheses (Scheme 28B), reaching high conversion
(over 93%) with excellent selectivity (100%) [380]. The reaction is
very temperature sensitive: working above 408 K (Scheme 28B)
causes urea decomposition with decrease of selectivity and forma-
tion of N-containing cycles such as oxazolidinones, which are cyc-
lic carbamates and monomers for polymers. The mechanism has
been fully elucidated [381].
Cyclic ethers are substrates of great interest for the synthesis of
cyclic monomeric carbonates or even as co-monomers for the pro-
duction of polymers through the ring-opening carboxylative poly-
merization. Their reactivity is driven by different parameters, such
as:
(i) the ring size and the ring stress-energy: three-, four-, ﬁve-,
six-membered ethers will have a quite different reactivity;
(ii) the substituents on the ring: groups which may produce a
different charge localization on O or ethereal Cs have an
inﬂuence on the rate of opening of the ring;

(iii) the ring backbone: an ethereal ring on a linear alkyl chain
(e.g., propene oxide) will have a different reactivity than
the same size ring on a alicyclic structure (e.g., cyclohexene
oxide).
This ﬁeld has been recently reviewed and the role and peculiar-
ities of a large variety of catalysts described in the several papers
cited [382,8]. The reaction mechanism has been studied and the
pathways depicted in Scheme 29 are commonly accepted. The
opening of the ring is promoted by either nucleophiles or elec-
trophiles. This makes the reaction very sensitive to the medium
in which it takes place. Adventitious species may deeply inﬂuence
the reaction, making difﬁcult the rationalization of the experimen-
tal data.
Optically active epoxides have been carboxylated with total
retention of conﬁguration [383,384] using heterogeneous catalysts,
while racemic mixtures of epoxide show a moderate ee upon car-
boxylation, due to the low stability of the homogeneous catalysts
(deanchoring of the optically active ligand) under the reaction con-
ditions [383].
The limiting factors in such chemistry are: (i) the production of
epoxides and (ii) the availability of a large variety of structural
motifs. The use of H2O2 represents the cleaner route to epoxides.
The cost and the amount available on the market (ca. 600 kt/y)
do not match well the parameters of commodity chemicals such
as the carbonates: low cost and market of several Mt/y). Therefore,
major improvements are necessary in this ﬁeld concerning: (i) the
use of cheap oxidants (air, O2) for the production of epoxides; (ii)
the availability of a larger number of structural motifs. Further
mechanistic studies are necessary as the gained knowledge is still
incomplete and does not allow to design the ‘‘perfect” catalyst.
The oxidative carboxylation of oleﬁns appears to be an interest-
ing approach to the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from cheap and
easily available reagents such as oleﬁns, non-O2-free CO2 and air
(Eq. (58)). The reaction can be carried under homogeneous and
heterogeneous catalysis. The latter assures a longer life of the
catalysts.

The direct oxidative carboxylation of oleﬁns [383,385,386] couples
two processes, namely: (i) the epoxidation of the oleﬁns and (ii) the
carbonation of the epoxide, occurring in the same reactor. More-
over, the problem of water is eliminated as it is not formed in the
system. Interestingly, it has been shown that CO2 modulates the
oxidant properties of O2 [387]. Drawback in such process is the rad-

may attack the oleﬁn with subsequent cleavage of the double bond,
producing by-products and low selectivity. The best selectivity
reached is 50% with respect to the oleﬁn. An attempt has been done
in decoupling the O-transfer to the oleﬁn from O2. Metal oxides
have been used as O-transfer agents, which where subsequently
re-oxidized with O2 in absence of oleﬁn [388–390]. Such approach
avoids the radical reaction, but introduces another hurdle: depend-
ing on the mode of preparation of the metal oxide the epoxidation
may be highly selective or combustion of the oleﬁn is observed.
4. CO2 as source of C for energy products
4.1. Thermal chemical processes
In recent years, signiﬁcant efforts have been made toward the
utilization of CO2 in high temperature catalyzed reactions, such
as dry reforming of methane (MDR), oxidative coupling of methane
(MOC), dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons (DH), in addition to the
conversion of CO2 into oxygen containing fuels such as CH3OH
and CH3OCH3 (DME) [382]. Transformation of CO2 into hydrogen
containing chemicals, typically requires hydrogen or electroreduc-
tive processes implying e and H+ transfer [391–394]. The use of
CO2 as oxidant in selective processes as well as C-source in the syn-
thesis of methanol or other energy rich species such as dimethy-
lether are key reactions [395] that may substantially contribute
to the conversions of large volumes of CO2 with signiﬁcant green-
house gases (GHG) mitigation, besides having an economic value.
4.1.1. Synthesis of methanol, dimethylether and higher alcohols
Methanol is a common feedstock considered as a building block
in the chemical industry due to its versatility in the synthesis of
several important chemicals such as chloromethane, acetic acid,
methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), alkyl halides and formaldehyde
[4,396,397]. Methanol can be converted into dimethyl ether
(DME) that is attracting a lot of attention as it can be used in fuel
cells and diesel engines [398]. In addition, methanol is used for
the production of higher hydrocarbons (through the methanol-to-
gasoline route) or of unsaturated hydrocarbons (through the metha-
nol to oleﬁns-MTO or methanol to propene-MTP routes).
Even though hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol has favorable
thermodynamics, high activation energy barriers must be over-
come and this requires the use of appropriate catalysts. Formation
of other by-products during the CO2 hydrogenation, such as CO,
hydrocarbons and higher alcohols [393] requires highly selective
heterogeneous catalysts with the important function of improving
the process sustainability or tunable catalysts which can address
the production of higher alcohols as an alternative. The reaction
for methanol production via CO2 hydrogenation is shown in Eq.
(59):

ð59Þ
Thermodynamically, a decrease of the reaction temperature or an
increase of the reaction pressure can favor the synthesis of
methanol. A reaction temperature higher than 513 K facilitates
the CO2 activation and, consequently, the methanol formation
[393,394,399].
Despite the numerous theories on the mechanistic pathways for
the methanol synthesis, and the extensive investigation, there is
still uncertainty on the deﬁnition of the role of Cu, Cu+, Cu-Zn
alloy and the carrier sites [400]. In the past, it has been assumed
that CO hydrogenation is the main pathway for methanol synthe-
sis.
However,
isotopic
labeling
experiments
conducted
by
Chinchen et al. [401] have revealed that methanol is formed
directly from CO2, while CO scavenges the oxygen atoms which
hinder the active metal sites [402,403].
According to earlier proposed mechanisms, formate hydrogena-
tion on Cu/ZnO catalysts is the rate-determining steps (Eq. (61)).
This was based on data reported by Fujitani et al. [404] who found
that the formate coverage on Cu/ZnO catalysts is proportional to
the turn over frequency for methanol formation. The proposed
reaction pathway is shown in Eqs. (60)–(62).

Fig. 18 shows the species that more likely are present on the surface
of a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst and the distinct role of Cu and Zr centers.
Scheme 30 compares the mechanism of CO vs CO2 conversion
into methanol. The CO2 route implies different intermediates such
as the formate species, not found in the CO conversion. These dis-
tinctive characters have ruled out that CO2 is converted ﬁrst via
RWGS into CO which is then converted into methanol.
Dimethyl ether (DME, CH3OCH3) is generally formed upon
methanol dehydration but can be directly produced by CO2 hydro-
genation. DME is an efﬁcient alternative to petroleum based trans-
portation fuels (due to its high cetane number) and liqueﬁed
natural gas and has been found to lead to a low environmental
impact since it does not generate sulfur oxide or soot [405,406].
In the chemical industry, DME is a useful intermediate for the syn-
thesis of chemicals such as methyl acetate, dimethyl acetate and
light oleﬁns [407,408]. Even though methanol has been used in
diesel engines, its low cetane number limits its application as a
replacement for diesel fuel. On the contrary, DME has about 40%
higher value in cetane number compared to diesel fuel and is, thus,
far superior compared to methanol for such application. Two main
pathways convert CO2 into DME: (i) a two-step process, i.e. metha-
nol
is
synthesized
on
a
suitable
metal
catalyst
(Eq.
(63)),
Scheme 31), which is then dehydrated on an acid catalyst (Eq.
(64)) and, (ii) a single-step process, using a bifunctional catalyst
that produces methanol and causes its dehydration in the same
reactor, forming DME (Eq. (65)) [409].
Scheme 31 summarizes the thermodynamic properties of the
conventional (CO based) synthesis of DME via the 2-step process
[407,410,411] as compared to the one step synthesis based on CO2.
The one step process, which integrates the methanol synthesis
and its dehydration to DME, reduces the investment and opera-
tional cost since only one reactor is required [412].
The study on the mechanism for the one-step CO2 hydrogena-
tion to DME is still in its infancy as most studies are devoted to
the optimization of the bifunctional catalyst. Chen et al. [407] have
conducted a kinetic and thermodynamic study on the DME produc-
tion via the direct synthesis route over a bifunctional Cu–ZnO–
Al2O3/HZSM-5 catalyst at various pressures. Their studies reveal
that DME production is governed by two different factors above
or below 498 K. At the lower temperatures (<498 K), the reaction
is dominated by chemical kinetics, whereas for the higher temper-
atures (>498 K), the thermodynamic equilibrium dominates the
reaction.
Based on a recent study on Cu–ZnO–ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 system, the
reaction pathway is proposed to be a multi-site reaction, taking
place with the primary formation of methanol and the consecutive
production of DME on the acid sites of the zeolite framework from
methanol dehydration [412]. According to Frusteri et al. [412], on
the Cu–ZnO–ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 system, H2 is initially adsorbed and
activated (H2
⁄) on the Cu sites, thus resulting in reduction of the
Cu species, whereas CO2 is bridge adsorbed on the basic surface
sites of ZnO and ZrO2 forming activated CO2 (CO2
⁄). Thereafter,

(such
as

at
the
metal-oxide interface prior to evolving as methanol from the

Based on the thermodynamic evaluation by Bonura et al. [411],
the conversion of methanol to DME on the acidic zeolite sites
rapidly approaches the equilibrium level at all the investigated
temperatures since it is a fast reaction. Moreover, they also
observed a promoting effect of the reaction temperature on the rel-
ative rate of methanol synthesis from CO2 rather than CO, on the
basis of thermodynamics. Hence, based on their ﬁndings, the
authors have proposed the reaction Scheme 32. It turns out that,
apart from the methanol dehydration, reaction (3) in Scheme 32
takes place very fast at any temperature, reactions (1) and (2)
(Scheme 32) affect the methanol formation in dependence of their
relative reaction rate. The thermodynamic analysis of the main
reaction paths involved in the synthesis of DME by CO2 hydrogena-
tion, reaction (5) in Scheme 32, reveals that, under kinetic condi-
tions,
the
CO
concentration
dramatically
increases
with
temperature; therefore, low reaction temperature and recycling
unreacted COx/H2 mixture could be a solution to improve the
methanol/DME productivity.

4.1.2. Methanation and synthesis of higher hydrocarbons
CO2 methanation is thermodynamically favorable (Xe > 95%)
around 573 K and 0.1–3.0 MPa. The methane selectivity is close
to 100% under these conditions. Interestingly, it has been demon-
strated that coke formation is not favored for stoichiometric or
H2-rich feed compositions. Therefore, hydrogenation of CO2–CH4
is
thermodynamically
feasible
for
improving
the
quality
of
CO2-rich natural gases. Experimental data over a variety of catalyst
systems support the above ﬁndings [413]. The thermodynamic
simulation to obtain equilibrium CO2 conversions and product
compositions was performed in the range T = 473–823 K, P = 0.1–
3.0 MPa and H2/CO2 = 1–8 mol/mol. Over the range of practical
interest, the carbon dioxide conversion is very high, while the com-
petitive reverse water gas shift is relatively insigniﬁcant. Conse-
quently, the equilibrium selectivity to methane is also very high.
Below 573 K, in most cases, complete conversion of CO2 to
methane with very high selectivity is thermodynamically feasible.
The approach to equilibrium analysis of experimental data sug-
gests that over Ni-based catalysts CO2 methanation could occur
via reverse water–gas-shift reaction. Methane formation from
CO2 has an interest for car industry as methane is a fuel already
used today. Obviously such conversion has a meaning only for
the environmental aspect of carbon-recycling. Considered the
low price of shale gas, the production of methane from CO2 using
renewable H2 is not economically comparable.
Methane has still a poor chemistry, due to the high energy of
the CAH bond. Although it is easy to convert methane by burning
the four hydrogens, it is very difﬁcult to selectively substitute one
or two Hs. Nevertheless studies on the coupling of methane to gen-
erate C2 or even Cn are ongoing (vide infra).
Catalytic conversion of CO2 to high energy chemicals such as
light oleﬁns and liquid hydrocarbons can generally proceed via
two routes: (i) conversion of CO2 into liquid hydrocarbons via CO
formation (F–T route), which is a combination of CO2 hydrogena-
tion by RWGS and further hydrogenation of CO to hydrocarbons,
and (ii) direct (without CO formation) hydrogenation of CO2 to
methanol, dimethyl ether (DME), higher alcohols, methane and
higher hydrocarbons. A common issue for such processes is the
production of hydrogen from renewable sources if large volumes
of CO2 should be converted. Key issues are: (i) the stability of the
CO2 molecule, (ii) the amount of H2 necessary to hydrogenate
CO2 and (iii) the kinetics of the reaction [414]. Hence, it is highly
crucial to employ suitable catalysts which can decrease the energy
barriers, thus resulting in lower energy states of the system.
Exploring the mechanistic pathways of such reactions may help
to gain a deeper insight into the feasibility of CO2 conversion at
lower temperatures.
4.1.3. CO2 as dehydrogenating agent of hydrocarbons
By coupling kinetic studies and CO2 chemisorption data, the
mechanism shown in Scheme 33 is proposed for the oxidative
coupling of methane to ethane.
CO2 adsorbs on the catalyst by interaction with the acid Ca2+
sites at the outermost layer via the O-atom (B). The Ce3+ sites
present in ceria activate CO2 forming CO and ‘‘active oxygen” spe-
cies present most likely as subsurface oxygen (C), responsible for
the conversion of methane to methyl radical (D). Hence, the coop-
eration of Ca2+ and Ce3+ sites in solid solution of the catalyst leads
to a greater chemisorption and activation of CO2 that produces
more active oxygen species for selective C2 formation. The incorpo-
ration of Ca2+ into CeO2 lattice (proven by XPS analysis) generates
defect sites, which can also promote redox interchange between
Ce4+ and Ce3+ [415].
The utilization of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)
of alkanes has received considerable attention in recent years.
CO2 has the potential to act as both a hydrogen acceptor and a
‘‘soft” oxidant. As co-fed gas in the oxidative dehydrogenation of
light alkanes it shifts the reaction equilibrium toward more oleﬁn
production [416,417]. The ODH reaction has a great interest as it
represents a straightforward reaction for the production of oleﬁns
such as ethene, propene and butene from their respective satu-
rated hydrocarbons. Such oleﬁns are classiﬁed as building blocks
in the petrochemical industry. Ethene, in particular, has a diversi-
ﬁed derivatives portfolio and can be used for the production of
plastics, polymers, ﬁbers and packaging materials [418,419]. The
dehydrogenation of light alkanes is reversible and, due to limita-
tion by thermodynamics, the reaction is often carried out at high
temperatures (>800 K). Industrially, steam cracking of hydrocar-
bons or naphtha is used for the synthesis of ethene, a very energy
consuming technology and prone to severe catalyst deactivation
due to coking [418]. Hence, it is desirable to utilize an oxidant cap-
able of oxidizing, in the presence of a suitable catalyst the hydro-
gen produced so to shift the equilibrium. The use of molecular
oxygen as oxidant can effectively reduce the reaction temperature.
Nevertheless, undesirable factors affect this reaction such as: the
low selectivity due to the production of COx species from HCs,
the need to remove excess heat of reaction, and the undesired reac-
tion mixture ﬂammability [420]. On the other hand, CO2 has been
found to serve as a medium for heat supply for the endothermic
dehydrogenation reaction, as a diluent to enhance equilibrium
conversion of alkanes and as a coke removal agent from the cata-
lyst [417]. In addition, CO2 inhibits deep oxidation of the reaction
products, thus improving the oleﬁn selectivity [421]. Catalysts
with redox properties, such as molybdenum-, chromium- and
vanadia-based catalysts, show high activity in various oxidative
dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons [422–425]. Factors
inﬂuencing the reaction also include acid-base bifunctionality,
which plays an important role in CO2-mediated dehydrogenation
reactions [426]. Both basic sites and Lewis-acid vacant sites are
important for hydrocarbons activation [427] In fact, an enhanced
basicity results in an improved performance due to the rapid des-
orption of the electron-rich alkenes, whereas Lewis acid sites

enhance the dehydrogenation process [428]. Also, in presence of
CO2 as feed, surface basicity favors the adsorption formation and
reduction of active chromium sites.
Using Cr-based catalysts, CO2 as oxidant (Scheme 34) is found
to boost the regeneration of the reduced chromium sites formed
during the dehydrogenation of propane (Eq. (66)) as well as the
consecutive reduction with H2 (Eq. (68)) [424], where CrOx repre-
sents the oxidized form and CrOx1 represents the reduced form
of the catalyst).
Scheme 35 shows the role of the metal in the dehydration of HC.
The vacancy created by the dehydrogenation is ﬁlled by CO2 con-
verted into CO.
The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (ODE) to styr-
ene is a promising alternative or complement to the current indus-
trial technology based on steam that may contribute to meeting
the growing demand of styrene and the strong market incentive
[429,430]. Styrene is one of the most widely used feedstock in
the production of high-value commercial products such as syn-
thetic rubbers, polystyrene and styrene–acrylonitrile copolymers
[429,431]. The global styrene annual production is 14.6 Mt, with
US producing 4 Mt and Europe 3.4 Mt, respectively [432].
Several possible mechanisms have been identiﬁed by Sun et al.
[433] taking into consideration that ethylbenzene (EB) is activated
by acid base catalysts or lattice oxygen (via redox mechanism) in
presence of CO2. Based on the CO2-ODE reaction over V and Fe
supported catalysts, Sun et al. [434] found that a synergistic
effect exists between EB dehydrogenation and the RWGS reaction.
In fact, CO2 can be either reduced to CO via interaction with
redox sites (one-step mechanism) or by reaction with hydrogen
formed in EB dehydrogenation (two-step pathway) as shown in
Scheme 36 [434].
Based on these two pathways, three vital mechanistic steps are
proposed. Mechanism 1 (one step pathway) is redox based: vana-
dia or ceria type catalysts play an important role for activation of
both CO2 and EB. The CAH bond breaking proceeds via a Mars-
van-Krevelen (redox) type mechanism and lattice oxygen of the
catalyst is consumed during dehydrogenation process, producing
styrene and water. The lattice oxygen however, is replenished by
CO2 dissociation to CO and surface oxygen species. Different types
of V and Ce species act as oxygen carrier through their oxidized-
reduced pairs [435].
In conclusion CO2 can act as a ‘‘soft oxidant” in the dehydro-
genation of HC to oleﬁns or can be hydrogenated to afford metha-
nol, higher alcohols, DME, or hydrocarbons. Such interesting
network of reactions is represented in Scheme 37.
4.2. Electrochemical processes
The electron-transfer to CO2 experiences both thermodynamic
and kinetic hindrance. The Gibbs free energy change (DG) of for-
mation of several C1 molecules is represented in Fig. 1. It says that
if CO2 has to be converted into species in which the C-oxidation
state is lower than +4, energy is needed if not also hydrogen. With
exception of CO that can be originated from CO2 through routes
that may or may not employ hydrogen (CO2 splitting to afford
CO and ‘‘O” does not require hydrogen), all other C1 molecules
have a H/C ratio that is higher than the value in CO2, where it is
zero. This means that the reduction process requires ‘‘H” or ‘‘e
plus H+” transfer. The source of ‘‘H, H+” must be water if the reduc-
tion of the heterocumulene must be performed on a large scale.
Using water as source of hydrogen, in principle, the reduction of
CO2 can be performed following two quite different routes: (i) elec-
trolysis of water to afford H2 and use of the latter in thermal cat-
alytic reactions with CO2 bearing to energy-rich C1 or C1+
molecules; (ii) electro-co-processing of CO2 and water to afford
C-reduced species. The two routes are quite different, as the former
requires production and possibly storage of H2 for the production
of CH4, CH3OH, DME, higher alcohols, etc., while the latter directly
converts CO2 into its reduced forms without any need of a prelim-
inary production of H2. The former option, which requires non-
fossil-C derived hydrogen, is limited today by the higher cost (up
to three times) of PV- or wind-H2 with respect to reforming-H2.
CO2 can be reduced through a 1e transfer to the radical anion
CO2
 . Any reduction of CO2 to other C1 species is a ‘‘nx2e” reduc-
tion. A process that may be born from the transfer of ‘‘1e” to CO2
is the synthesis of CAC bonds. For example, the C2 species oxalic
acid (HO2CACO2H), in which the oxidation state of C is +3, can
be formed by coupling two CO2
  units followed by protonation;

the direct carboxylation of hydrocarbons forming carboxylic acids
(RAH + CO2 ? RACO2H), in which again the formal oxidation state
of C in CO2 is +3, is another interesting reaction. The 1e transfer to
CO2 can originate also a second species that is the carbonyl-
carbonate,
OC(@O)AOC(@O), obtained upon coupling of CO2
with CO2
 and subsequent transfer of a second electron to the pro-
duct of coupling. However, several questions may be born to the
mind of the reader, such as: are radical-anions CO2
 to be likely
intermediates in the synthesis of other C1 molecules? Is such
one-electron transfer thermodynamically more or less feasible
than a multielectron process? Is the multielectron transfer a
process occurring at different potentials per each e-transfer? Or
are possible iso-potential (iso-energetic) synchronous multiple
e-transfers? Also, when a metal interacts with the C-atom of
CO2, or electrons are transferred to the same atom, the molecular
geometry of the latter is dramatically changed and the change
requires the reorganization of the energy levels of the molecular
orbitals. Does such geometry change represent an inﬂuential bar-
rier to the reduction of CO2? Therefore, does the coordination
mode inﬂuence the 1e  2e transfer? The electroreduction of
CO2 is not a trivial case. In this section, an answer will be
attempted to such questions, and the state of our knowledge
presented.
The potentials of the various reactions of reduction of CO2 to
other C1 molecules are shown in Table 4. It is quite evident that
the one-electron transfer is a process that requires higher energy
than the multi-electron transfers.
If the reductions are considered to take place in water, then it is
useful to recall the Frost diagram built by correlating the number
of electrons transferred in a process and the free energy change
(or electrochemical potential) of that process (Fig. 19). If coordi-
nated CO2, more than free CO2, has to be reduced, then a key step
in the entire reduction process is the bonding of CO2 to the metal
center.
It has been shown that ligands may inﬂuence the mode of bond-
ing of CO2 to the metal center. Moreover, carrying out the electro-
reduction in water, requires that the metal center is stabilized by
ligands that have a good water afﬁnity, proper donor properties
and correct steric hindrance.
Consequently, N- or O-ligands are more frequently used than
phosphines, unless the latter are conveniently functionalized (for
example with sulfonic groups or other water soluble moieties)
for enhancing their water solubility or mixed organic-water sol-
vent media are used. Fig. 20 presents a list of P, O, N-ligands, from
the historical ones such as cyclam used in the ﬁrst studies in this
ﬁeld, to more sophisticated ones.
A key note is that the electroreduction of CO2 may take place at
the electrode surface or be mediated by a catalyst attached to the
electrode or soluble in the solvent (Scheme 38). In case (A) the
reaction occurs at the surface of the electrode that directly trans-
fers electrons to CO2: this in general requires high overvoltage
and may cause electrode deterioration or even consumption and
scarce selectivity. In case (B), the electrode transfers electrons to
the catalyst which then interacts with CO2 causing its reduction.
In such case, CO2 is not in contact with the electrode, and this
results in a better stability of the electrode and its longer life, that
may be important in the overall cost determination of a process.
Another advantage of electrocatalysis is that overvoltages are
reduced almost to zero and the electron transfer occurs near the
thermodynamic potential of the reaction, e.g. E (substrates/prod-
ucts), one wishes to perform.
4.2.1. One-electron transfer to CO2 vs multi-electron transfer
The one electron transfer to free CO2 affords CO2
 , as seen
above. Table 4 shows that it is much more energy requiring than
multielectron transfers. Moreover, the potential is dependent on
the medium in which the electron transfer occurs: polar media
(1.9 V) or apolar media (2.21 V). The one electron-transfer gen-
erates the CO2
 species that can evolve according to two different
routes (Scheme 39).
The radical anion CO2
 has a life as short as 30–93 ls, as dis-
cussed above. It can be stabilized by interaction with the solvent
or radical traps. It can attack a second CO2 molecule via a hetero
OAC coupling and generate the dianion (A) in Scheme 39 that
can be the source of CO and carbonate, as already seen. However,
by protonation, the following couple of products can be obtained:
either CO and hydrogen carbonate HCO3
, or CO2 and formate
HCO2
.
Viceversa, the homo CAC coupling of two radical anions with
antiparallel spin of the electron localized on C will produce the
oxalate anion (B). The e-transfer to ‘‘free” CO2 has been attempted
for the synthesis of oxalates, with alternate fortune [436]. If the
homo-coupling or hetero-coupling are favored will depend on sev-
eral parameters such as: the solvent, the current density, the
electrode.
All anions will need a cation for neutralization, which is pro-
vided by the electrode, in general, that is consumed. Such technol-
ogy is not exploited at industrial level.
4.2.2. Competitive coordination of CO2 and H+ to a catalytic center and
their reduction
When the electron transfer implies CO2 coordinated to a metal
center, then several factors determine both the kinetics and ther-
modynamics of the reaction. Such factors can be categorized as fol-
lows: the metal, the nature and structure of the ligand, the
geometry of the metal-complex, the solvent: they may affect the
electron-transfer process in many ways.
Moreover, the addition of a proton to the metal center and its
consequent reduction to H2 is a side-by-side process with CO2

coordination-reduction. However, the reduction of CO2 in water is
not a simple process and the selectivity toward a target C1 or C1+
molecule containing CO2 in a reduced form is quite variable with
the system used, having the formation of either hydrogen or other
C-species as a competing process. Some of the competitive reac-
tions are shown in Scheme 40. A variety of metal systems have
been used as catalysts in the electroreduction of CO2, the most
studied being Ni, Co, Pd, Ru. While in the photochemical or photo-
electrochemical processes Ru and Re are mainly used. A different
mechanism always based on a double consecutive (e + H+) trans-
fer has been proposed (Scheme 41) in which the formation of the
‘‘PdAC(CO)OH2” intermediate more than the hydroxyl-carbene is
postulated.
Scheme 42 shows the multiple ‘‘e + H+” transfer to afford
methanol. Such a sequence is very interesting as it can be found
in enzymatic reactions. (see Section 5).
The use of pyridine as an organic catalyst [438–440] has been
proposed by Bocarsly and coworkers. The interesting aspect of
such electrocatalysts is that they can promote several ‘‘1e + H+”
transfer steps affording several reduced species of CO2, such as:
HCO2H, CH2O, CH3OH, but also C2 and C3 species. Quite recently,
the authors have critically reviewed [441] the proposed mecha-
nisms and report the possible role of H-bonded pyridinium-to-
pyridine

the

Very recently [437] a 2e reduction of N-heterocyclic carbene-carbonyl Mn(I) to Mn
(I) has been reported that occurs at the same potential (1.35 V vs SCE) instead of
two consecutive potential apart of a few hundreds mV as shown for analogous
MnBr(CO)x(2N  1). Such Mn complexes catalyze very selectively the CO2 to CO
reduction with a Faradic efﬁciency of 34.6%. All the above catalytic systems afford
mainly CO, an interesting molecule as it may release energy in the combustion with
air (see Fig. 11a), but more useful C1 or C1+ molecules can be produced.

and generate electrons and holes used in the reduction of CO2 and
oxidation of an electron donor (water should be used, or waste
organics that may also be oxidized in useful products), respec-
tively. In addition, photoelectrochemical (PEC) reduction of CO2
is playing a more and more important role. In PEC, a photoactive
material is attached to the electrode surface and the excitons pro-
duced upon irradiation generate electrons used for the reduction
process. All such methodologies have in common the ‘‘electron plus
proton” transfer to CO2. Recently, the use of solar energy for pow-
ering the reduction of CO2 is much under consideration as this
would represent a way to convert low-value CO2 into useful chem-
icals and fuels mimicking Nature and natural photosynthesis. The
use of PV as source of electrons in reduction reactions is considered
today with much attention as it may represent an effective way to
the conversion of large volumes of CO2. As a matter of fact, the use
of PV for CO2 reduction using water as electron donor, already
today is an attractive technology, although the cost may appear
high. From the solar to chemicals/fuels (StC/F) energy conversion
point of view, it must be pointed out that the most ready technol-
ogy is based on the sequence shown in Scheme 44.
The use of solar energy and other perennial primary sources of
energy (wind, geothermal, hydro) for the reduction of CO2 has a
great relevance to the conversion of large volumes of CO2 to
valuable chemicals and fuels. All such sources can be used in a
indirect way, as they can generate electricity that can be used
either, as indicated above, for the reduction of CO2 in water, or
for the electrolysis of water to afford hydrogen that can be used
for CO2 reduction. In the very short term the use of excess electric
energy (out of peak electricity), especially if produced from peren-
nial sources, is a suitable strategy, in the medium term the use of
PV can results in a viable approach [442]. Today, the cost of PV is
too high (Table 5) for a practical application.
This implies that the price of chemicals produced by using the
PV-generated H2 will be much higher than that of products
obtained using H2 produced by reforming of methane. Anyway, if
one considers the perspective increase of the efﬁciency of PV (from
20% to 40%) and the reduced cost of PV-materials, one can foresee
that the price of PV-generated H2 will decrease and get close to
that of H2 by reforming. So, in the short term H2 generated via
PV or wind- or geothermal- or hydro-electricity may compete with
H2 produced by methane reforming.
In such frame, the use of solar energy assumes a particular role
as solar radiations can be used directly in photochemical-PC and
photoelectrochemical-PEC processes. The former use either soluble
(homogeneous) or insoluble (heterogeneous) compounds that may
capture solar radiations that generate excitons (e + hole) used for
the direct reduction of CO2 and oxidation of the donor (water or
waste organics to be converted into usable products) while in
PEC electrons generated in photoreactions are used in conjunction
with an electrode.
In a homogeneous photochemical process, (Fig. 21) the solar
radiations are captured by a soluble sensitizer (P) in presence of
a donor (D) while a solid photomaterial is used in heterogeneous
photochemical processes (Fig. 22).
The photosensitizer is excited to P⁄ with production of an exci-
ton (e+ hole). The hole oxidizes the donor (water or a waste)
while the negative charge is transferred to a metal center (Mred)
where the CO2 is reduced to C1 or C1+ species with re-oxidation
of the metal center.
Several sensitizers have been used such as metal-complexes
(Ru, Re) with the 2N  1 ligand and its derivatives or organic com-
plex molecules. Solid inorganic materials [443] can also be used as
heterogeneous photocatalysis.
Another approach to the use of solar energy is the hybrid sys-
tem [182,444–447] formed by enzymes for the selective reduction
of CO2 and solar energy and photomaterials for the regeneration of
co-factors (Fig. 23).
In all above systems, a key parameter is the ‘‘quantum efﬁ-
ciency” expressed as (Eq. (70)) where ne
U ¼ ðmolproducts=nphotons adsorbedÞ  ne
ð70Þ
is again the number of electrons transferred to CO2. The quantum
yield is a parameter somehow similar to the ‘‘Faradic Efﬁciency”.

Among homogeneous photocatalysts, it is worth citing metal
complexes with ligands having an extended system of conjugated
double-bonds able to adsorb solar light: phtalocyanins [448], cor-
roles [449], corrins [450] or similar macrocyclic systems are typical
ligands. The metal centers are Co or Fe or other metals. The
negative point is that a low selectivity is observed with a large
production of hydrogen, and this is true also for those systems,
which under electrochemical conditions are quite effective for
CO2 reduction to C1 species (Scheme 45) .
In early studies of the 1980s [451–453] Ru(2N  1)3
n+ was used
as efﬁcient photosensitizer and costly organic molecules as
e-donors. The drawback was that the sacriﬁcial reagents were
more expensive than the products formed from CO2, making such
systems not economically viable. An interesting case in which a
unique complex acts as sensitizer and catalyst is represented by
Re(2N  1)(CO)3X (X = Cl, Br) [451,454] able to selectively produce
CO.
The semiconductor band gap must match the potential of
reduction of CO2 for a reaction to occur (Fig. 24), otherwise the
absorption will not produce any conversion reaction.
This problem can be solved by modifying the TiO2 properties by
deposition on its surface of materials which can inﬂuence the band
gap by shifting it more toward the visible region or by increasing
its ability in using the near UV radiations which constitute ca. 7%
of the Visible Light. This is possible in several modes [184].
The interesting aspect of PEC is that it is possible to use such
technology with a single dual-face electrode (Fig. 25) in compact
two-compartment single cell that allows simple product separation.
Such device needs a well-performing, fast and robust proton-
exchange membrane. In principle, a cell designed for water split-
ting [455] under solar irradiation may serve also for CO2-water
co-processing. Therefore, work done for solar-driven water split-
ting [456] can be transferred to CO2 conversion into chemicals/fu-
els under solar irradiation.
The interesting aspect is that, as it has been discussed above, dif-
ferent electrocatalysts may afford different CO2-reduction product.
Therefore, such technology may result in a ﬂexible tool for the
production of selected chemicals or fuels from CO2 and water, imple-
menting a ‘‘CO2–H2O based economy”. Adaptation of the combinato-
rial approach to testing electrocatalysts [457] has been proposed as a
route to shortening time-to-market for such devices. Miniaturiza-
tion [458] or development of new concept photobioreactors [459]
can be a way to solving the space issue, which is a predominant
factor in the large scale development of CO2 conversion. Coupling
EC-PC-PEC with thermal processes and with enhanced biotechno-
logical conversion of CO2 [382] may shorten time to exploitation
of carbon-recycling, mimicking natural photosynthesis.
5. Biotechnological uses of CO2
Biotechnology may provide new opportunities for sustainable
production of existing and new products and services. In contrast
with chemical processes, the biocatalyst-based processes occur at
low temperature, produce fewer emissions and by-products, and
in general, less toxic waste if the microbial biomass itself is cor-
rectly managed.
Biotechnological routes to enhanced biological conversion of
CO2 involve the use of enzymes or (modiﬁed) organisms to convert
CO2 into useful products under optimized conditions. They can be
categorized as follows.

solar light.

duced under ‘‘non natural” or ‘‘enhanced” conditions from
CO2 and sunlight, is used as source of chemicals or raw
materials which are catalytically processed to afford useful
products.

cyanobacteria (a branch of microalgae) to use CO2 as a car-
bon source and sunlight are merged with the metabolic path-

or
chemicals,

organisms use CO2 as a carbon source and PV-electricity as
an energy source for the synthesis of chemicals and fuels,

molecule using non-fossil hydrogen as an energy carrier,
(5) Man-made photosynthesis, where CO2 and water are con-
verted into desired chemicals or fuels with the aid of a (bio)-
catalyst or through integrated biotechnological-chemical
processes.
5.1. Integration of biotechnology and chemical catalysis
5.1.1. Aquatic biomass technologies
Aquatic biomass [460] (microalgae in particular [461,462]) can
be grown using air enriched with carbon dioxide. The concentra-
tion of CO2 in the gaseous phase can be increased up to 150 times
the natural one, conditions referred as CO2 enhanced ﬁxation. By
implementing the concept of bioreﬁnery, aquatic biomass may be
used as a source of raw materials catalytically converted into
energy products (fuels), chemicals and new materials.
Aquatic biomass has a higher photosynthetic efﬁciency (6–8%)
than terrestrial biomass (1.5–2.2%).
The interesting aspect is that ﬂue gases from power plants or
streams from industries can in principle be pumped into a photo-
bioreactor or into ponds under controlled conditions as a source of
carbon [463], supposed that the concentration of toxic species such
as NOx or SOy are kept below the threshold accepted by the algal
pond (usually below 150 ppm [464]). Selected microalgae with a
high biomass and lipid productivity such as, Botryococcus braunii,
Chlorella vulgaris, and Scenedesmus sp. have been cultivated using
either ambient air, or air enriched with 10% CO2 or ﬂue gas
[463,465]. Some strains are appropriate for mitigating CO2, due
to their high biomass productivity and C-ﬁxation ability.
Algal biomass contains three main components (Fig. 26), e.g.:
carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, in addition to minor amounts
of essential vitamins [466] and omega-3 fatty acids (Table 6).
Some species can be engineered to produce a speciﬁc product:
Botryococcus braunii has been engineered to produce the terpenoid
C30 botryococcene, a hydrocarbon similar in structure to squalene
[467,468].

Several companies produce microalgae for different uses, exam-
ples are listed in Table 7.
Biofuels such as biodiesel, bioethanol, bio-hydrogen and biogas
can be produced from aquatic biomass. The quality and composi-
tion of the biomass will suggest the best option for the biofuel to
be produced. A biomass rich in saturated lipids will be suitable
for the production of biodiesel, while unsaturated lipids will be
used for the production of chemicals and a biomass rich in sugars
will be suited for the production of bioethanol. The anaerobic fer-
mentation of residual biomass can be used for producing biogas.
Fig. 27 gives an example of utilization of algal oil in the chemical
and energy industry.
In a commercial culture what is of interest is the productivity of
a pond that means the production per unit time. Often, fast grow-
ing algae are not the most specialized for a target product.
The use of process water that may contain nutrients (N- and P-
compounds and trace elements) for the growth of the biomass is
essential: the addition of nutrients (micro and macro) is not eco-
nomical and does not make this technology useful for CO2
reduction.
Synthetic biology and genomics can enhance the productivity
and increase the use of algae to produce advanced plastics (colla-
gen, gelatine, alginates, casein, elastin, and zein), hybrid co-
polymers and chemicals from biomass generated from enhanced
CO2 ﬁxation.
5.1.2. Advanced biotechnological processes
Cyanobacterial species are easier to genetically manipulate than
eukaryotic algae and other photosynthetic organisms, and are
being engineered for the production of chemicals or fuels directly
from CO2 [469,470]. Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a type of
biodegradable polymer for potential application in biomedical or
pharmaceutical ﬁeld. Several cyanobacteria such as Aphanothece
sp. [471], Oscillatoria limosa [472], some species of the genus Spir-

ulina [473,474], and the thermophilic strain Synechococcus sp.
MA19 [475] are natural producers of PHA with a yield <10%.
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 [476] genetically modiﬁed produces
PHA with 14 wt%. High PHA accumulation of up to 52% dry cell
weight was demonstrated in marine cyanobacterium Synechococ-
cus sp. PCC 7002. The Synechococcus sp. was transformed with
plasmid carrying Cupriavidus necator PHA biosynthetic genes using
recA complementation as selection pressure for plasmid stability
[477]. The ability of (S)- and (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate molecules
synthesis and secretion from genetically engineered Synechocystis
sp. PCC 6803 cells was also reported [478].
The modiﬁed Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 has been
used
for
direct
photosynthetic
conversion
of
CO2
into
3-
hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) [479] or 1-butanol [480]. Cyanobac-
teria have also been engineered to produce isoprene and/or ethene.
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was modiﬁed to produce 50 lg g1 dry
cell weight per day of isoprene [481–483]. An increase in photo-
synthetic carbon partitioning toward production of isoprene
(120 lg g1) was achieved by the heterologous expression of the
mevalonic acid pathway in Synechocystis, which enriched the
pool of precursors to isoprene, isopentenyl-diphosphate and
dimethylallyl-diphosphate [484].
5.1.3. Bioelectrochemical systems
Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) have recently been proposed
as a new and sustainable technology for energy generation and
useful products from wastes: in a BES, bacteria interact with
solid-state electrodes by exchanging electrons with them, either
directly or via redox mediators [485]. A possible application is
the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to methane
according to reaction (72):
CO2 þ 8Hþ þ 8e ! CH4 þ 2H2O
ð71Þ
Indeed, both the electrons and carbon dioxide released at the
anode during the microbial oxidation of the organic matter
contained in a waste stream can be in principle exploited for the
cathodic generation of methane [486]. At standard conditions, this
reaction requires a theoretical voltage of 0.244 V (vs SHE) at pH 7,
but it is usually affected by quite large overpotentials that, how-
ever, could be possibly reduced by using a microbial biocathode.
Another interesting example of bioelectrochemical systems is
presented by the enzyme formate dehydrogenases that contains
molybdenum or tungsten cofactors able to transfer the electrons
from formate oxidation to an independent active site, to reduce
quinone, protons, or NAD(P) [487,488]. These enzymes are suitable
for adsorption onto an electrode, so that the electrode accepts the
electrons from formate oxidation, and it may also donate electrons
and drive CO2 reduction. Therefore, they are potential electrocata-
lysts for the reduction of CO2 (see Fig. 28). Two electrons are trans-
ferred from the electrode to the active site (buried inside the
insulating protein interior) by the iron–sulfur clusters, to reduce
CO2 to formate, forming a CAH bond. Conversely, when formate
is oxidized, the two electrons are transferred from the active site
to the electrode.
One
of
the
tungsten-containing
formate
dehydrogenases,
namely FDH1, can be isolated from Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans,
an anaerobic bacterium that oxidizes propionate to acetate, CO2,
and six reducing equivalents [489].
The reducing equivalents are used to reduce protons to hydro-
gen or CO2 to formate. The NADH-independent FDH enzymes from
S. fumaroxidans are highly unstable and inactive in the presence of
O2, limiting their practical application. Differently, the NADH-
dependent FDH from Candida boidinii (CbsFDH) is sufﬁciently
stable for commercial use and has been used to enzymatically
regenerate NADH. CbsFDH requires NADH, protons and electrons
to convert CO2 into formate, the latter can be supplied by the elec-
trochemical system of the Cu electrode (Fig. 29). The [Cp⁄Rh(bpy)
Cl]+ complex has been used as catalyst for the conversion of
NAD+ into the active NADH with almost 100% selectivity [490,491].

that can interconvert CO2 to formate electrochemically [492], these
enzymes

extremely weak stability in the presence of oxygen, which could be
a severe obstacle for the industrial application of enzymatic CO2
reduction. Although one example of oxygen-tolerant formate
dehydrogenase has been reported, this enzyme requires the expen-
sive NADH cofactor with hydrogen gas as an electron donor [493].
In addition, the use of separated enzymes requires extra puriﬁca-
tion steps that may increase the cost of the reaction system.
Interestingly, in order to facilitate the process, microbial whole
cell systems have been used that can be applied under aerobic
conditions. Methylobacterium microbial were found to produce for-
mate from CO2 by using electrons supplied from cathode electrode
[494,495].
Bioelectrochemical systems have been used also for the micro-
bial electrosynthesis (MES) of acetate from the biocathodic reduc-
tion of carbon dioxide. Hydrogen carbonates (the dissolved form of
CO2) were the substrate for the bioelectrochemical production of
acetate under mild applied cathodic potential of 400 mV (vs
SHE) in single chamber electrochemical cells [496].
5.1.4. CO2 fermentation
The idea to convert CO2 and H2 to biomethane (Eq. (72))
through a chemoautotrophic conversion mediated by methano-
genic archaea is still undeveloped because most of the H2 produc-
tion worldwide comes from steam reforming of CH4 [497].
CO2 þ 4H2 ! CH4 þ 2H2O
ð72Þ
However, if one considers the implementation of renewable ener-
gies and produces H2 from wind and solar power through water
electrolysis, the transformation of carbon dioxide into biomethane
can make sense, which can be injected into natural gas (NG) grids
or employed as fuel for vehicles [498]. CO2 can be selectively fer-
mented to specialty, commodity chemicals, food components or
fuels using metabolically engineered biocatalysts with high product
selectivity [499] in contrast with chemical syngas catalysis charac-
terized by low selectivity. CO2-rich syngas or captured CO2 with
added hydrogen can be completely fermented by engineered bio-
catalysts with zero CO2 process emissions to target products if
non-fossil H2 sources are available (sea water electrolysis using
electricity produced by high efﬁciency solar panels in situ) [499].
Acetogenic bacteria are used to produce alcohols and organic
acids directly from CO2 and H2. In particular Clostridium carboxidi-
vorans and Clostridium ragsdalei can metabolize syngas compo-
nents to produce ethanol and acetic acid [500–503].
5.1.5. Man made photosynthesis
Nature, which generates up to 115 Gt [504] of biomass annually
from the reduction of CO2 using solar energy, provides inspiration
to develop man-made systems able to capture solar energy and
convert CO2 and H2O into value-added chemicals. Two classes of
enzyme, carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODH) and formate
dehydrogenases (FDH), catalyze two-electron reduction of CO2,
the ﬁrst and crucial stage of its entry into organic chemistry. The
enzymes avoid radical intermediates such as CO2
 or COOH
(1.9 V vs SHE at pH 7 [505]) proceeding instead via proton-
coupled electron transfers (PCET) in single concerted steps to CO
or HCOOH. Both CODH and FDH are reversible electrocatalysts
when attached to graphite electrodes [506,507], suggesting their
use as CO2 reduction catalysts in (bench-scale) manmade photo-
synthesis systems.
Of interest is also the hybrid bioinspired systems used for the
enzymatic reduction of CO2 to CH3OH in water [445] that combines
two processes: the enzymatic reduction of CO2 to CH3OH promoted
by the reduced form of coenzyme NADH with the in situ efﬁcient
and selective photocatalytic regeneration of NADH from NAD+,
using semiconductors. A number of semiconducting materials that
behave as photocatalysts under visible-light, such as: Cu2O, InVO4,
TiO2 modiﬁed either with the organic compound rutin, or with the
inorganic complex [CrF5(H2O)]2) [447] and the doped sulﬁde Fe/
ZnS have been prepared and used for the reduction of NAD+ to
NADH. The expected mechanism of NADH regeneration is shown
in Scheme 46.
Regeneration of the cofactor NADH from NAD+ has been
achieved
by
using
visible
light-active
heterogeneous
TiO2-
modiﬁed photocatalysts. The regeneration process is made more
efﬁcient by using a RhIII-complex that facilitates the electron and
hydride transfer from the H-donor (water or a water-glycerol solu-
tion) to NAD+. In this way one mol of NADH was used for producing
100–1000 mol of CH3OH, opening the way to a practical applica-
tion [445].
Of interest is also the graphene-based photocatalyst integrated
sequentially with enzymes formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde
dehydrogenase,
and
alcohol
dehydrogenase
as

conversion of CO2 and water into chemicals and fuels, mimicking
Nature. Another recent use of photocatalysis is the direct ﬁxation
of CO2 into an organic substrate to afford acids (Scheme 17). Inor-
ganic materials (semiconductors) have been engineered to use
solar light for the reduction of CO2 to C1 or Cn species [509]. Pho-
toelectrochemistry [PEC] can represent an interesting tool for the
conversion of CO2 using solar energy (see Section 4.3).
The challenge is, thus, open for a large scale CO2 conversion
mimicking Nature. Our future will be based on a ‘‘CO2-water econ-
omy” if we will be good enough to make an integrated use of
biotechnology and catalysis for the conversion of CO2 into useful
products.
6. Conclusions
Carbon dioxide can be used as synthon for several carboxylated
products, or source of carbon for fuels. A few reactions are known
since the late 1800 and industrial processes are run since more
than a century that today use 180 MtCO2/y, to which 20 MtCO2/y
as technological ﬂuid must be added. The exploited processes do
not require a high energy input as the carbon atom maintains
the same +4 oxidation state in the product (mainly chemicals) as
in free CO2. In perspective, in a business as usual scenario, the
amount of CO2 that can be used may grow to ca. 330 Mt/y by
2030, that in terms of avoided CO2 corresponds to ca. 1 GtCO2/y.
Considered in terms of carbon mitigation, such use of CO2 does
not make a signiﬁcant contribution to C-reduction. Conversely, the
use of CO2 as source of carbon for fuels may expand the amount of
used CO2 by one order of magnitude, as the market of fuels is 12–
14 times larger than that of chemicals. Such new use requires
energy and hydrogen, two requisites that have so far ruled out
the production of fuels from CO2 as both energy and H2 are mainly
(85–93%) derived from fossil carbon. However, if perennial ener-
gies such as solar, wind and geothermal are used for running the
conversion of CO2 into fuels, the use of large volumes of CO2 will
be made possible and by 2050 several GtCO2/y would be converted
into non-fossil carbon based products for the chemical or energy
industry. This would make the carbon dioxide capture and
utilization-CCU technology as one of the routes that may help to
cut substantial emissions of CO2. Recycling of carbon in CCU would

complement the natural C-cycle making a step away from the
actual linear C-economy, toward a circular C-economy.
Compared to the CO-chemistry, the CO2 chemistry is very young
as it has been developed after Aresta and coll. discovered in 1975
the ﬁrst Ni-CO2 complex and demonstrated that the coordination
of CO2 to a metal center facilitates the splitting of the CAO bond,
a reaction that for the free molecule requires high energy (thermal
or radiative).
Since then, new reactions have been discovered for CO2 conver-
sion into ﬁne chemicals or intermediates, some of which are cat-
alytic processes while others are syntheses assisted by metals
and consume one mol of metal per mol of CO2 converted. This is
not economically nor energetically acceptable, and is a heavy envi-
ronmental burden. Making such processes catalytic is a must for
their exploitation that would result in a considerable cut of CO2
emissions as the CO2-based processes are more direct than those
on stream, use safer conditions, increasing the efﬁciency of energy
and material use.
The reaction parameter space (T, P, solvent, catalyst, conversion
yield, selectivity, separation techniques, etc.) must be correctly
managed to ensure that the new reaction is a net CO2-consumer
and not an emitter.
Several routes are possible for the conversion of CO2 into fuels, a
strong endergonic process, that can be run using perennial primary
energy sources such as solar, wind or geothermal. Hydrogen neces-
sary for the conversion of CO2 into C1 or Cn energy-rich species,
must be produced from water or waste organics. Electrochemical
technologies for water electrolysis are commercial and used today.
Excess electric energy is already used today with proﬁt: using fossil
carbon derived electricity for CO2 conversion would not represent a
wise solution as the whole process would not reduce the CO2 emis-
sion. The use of excess electric energy (eventually produced also by
nuclear plants) goes in the direction of a higher efﬁciency in the use
of fossil carbon and makes the CO2 conversion a way to store elec-
tricity, a problem so far not yet solved as batteries do not represent
the best solution on a large scale. The use of PV for H2 production,
today not convenient from the economical point of view, may
become convenient in the near future if the target of 40% efﬁciency
in solar energy conversion into electricity is reached and cheap
materials are developed for capture of solar energy. Also, the reduc-
tion of emissions in the production of PV materials must be tar-
geted. The photochemical and photoelectrochemical conversion of
CO2 is innovative technologies that may play a key role in support-
ing the conversion of large volumes of CO2 into fuels or chemicals.
Integrating biotechnology and catalysis may push toward a bet-
ter exploitation of biomass obtained in natural or enhanced pro-
cesses, and mastering algae growing for fuels and chemicals may
give a substantial contribution to CO2 mitigation. The development
of innovative technologies based on integrated biotech and cataly-
sis as bioelectrochemical technologies or microbial fuel cells, may
also give a strong push toward the exploitation of CO2 as source
of carbon.
Several new processes have been discovered that must be cor-
rectly mastered in order to make them net CO2 consumers. The Life
Cycle Assessment-LCA methodology must be used for assessing the
real impact on CO2 mitigation of the new synthetic routes.
Scientists and technologists have in their hands powerful tools
for CO2 reduction, ﬁnancial support is necessary for their assess-
ment and growth from actual TRL 3–5 to exploitation and this
must jointly come from the public and private sectors.
Mimicking Nature in CO2 conversion via photosynthetic pro-
cesses will represent a move from the today linear carbon economy
toward a circular carbon economy based on CO2 and water, con-
verting spent carbon into working carbon, saving natural resources
for future generations and implementing the concept of sustain-
able chemistry.
Each atom of carbon recycled is an atom of carbon that does not
reach the atmosphere today and stays in the ground for next
generations.
