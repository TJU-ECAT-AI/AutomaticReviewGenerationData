Abstract 
A new method determining the specific rate with no information about the number 
of active sites was applied to the reverse-Boudourad reaction over supported Ni 
catalysts.  It was found that the catalyst support hardly affected the specific rate.  
The activity pattern and activation energies agreed well with those obtained by a 
conventional method using TG, suggesting the validity of the new method for 
studying the kinetics.

INTRODUCTION 
 
  Gasification of carbonaceous materials has recently attracted increased 
attention from the viewpoint of utilizing renewable biomass resources as 
energies [1].  One of these is the reaction with carbon dioxide, the so-called 
reverse-Boudouard reaction, having the enthalpy change of ΔH0 ≅ 170 kJ mol−1 
at 298 K:

(I) 
 
Using catalysts in this process can lower the reaction temperature and/or 
increase the reaction rate, by which the energy necessary for the system can 
significantly be reduced.  A number of studies have been carried out using 
various kinds of catalysts [2-6].  This reaction is also important in CO2-
reforming of CH4 from the viewpoint of suppressing carbon deposition [7, 8].  
By enhancing the reaction, catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition 
during the reforming is avoided.  Nickel is known to be one of the active 
catalysts for the gasification of activated carbons and less valuable coals at low 
temperatures [9, 10], e.g., the gasification rate at 773 K is comparable to that at 
1073 K without catalyst [11].  It seems, however, that kinetic studies are still 
limited.  In this paper, kinetics of carbon-CO2 reaction over supported Ni 
catalysts was studied in terms of the specific rate constant determined with no 
information about the number of active sites [12].   
 
 
EXPERIMENTAL 
 
  Supported Ni catalysts were prepared by a conventional impregnation 
method using Al2O3 (GL Science, Active Alumina), SiO2 (GL Science, Silica 
Gel), and TiO2 (Nippon Aerosil, P-25) as a catalyst support [7].  Metal loading 
was 20 wt.%.  Before reaction, the catalyst was reduced in a hydrogen stream 
(30 mL/min) at 773 K for 3 h.  Characterization data of the catalysts were 
shown previously [7].   
  The apparatus for investigating the kinetics of the reverse-Boudouard 
reaction was composed of a pulse microreactor directly connected to a gas 
chromatography equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (Shimadzu GC-
8A).  After the reduction of the catalyst, helium gas (30 mL/min) was passed to 
purge hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the catalyst.  A constant amount of CH4 
(0.5 mL) was pulsed via the helium carrier gas to deposit carbonaceous 
materials on the catalyst.  Then, via the carrier gas, CO2 (0.5 mL) was injected 
to the catalyst at an interval of ca. 6 min and the effluent gases were analyzed 
by gas chromatography.   
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
  When a certain volume of CO2 was pulsed onto the catalyst, to which CH4 
was previously injected, CO was produced from CO2 pulse.  The amount of CO

produced was much larger than that from CO2 pulse onto the fresh catalyst.  
These findings lead us to conclude that carbon deposited on the catalyst from 
CH4 decomposition reacts with CO2 to produce CO (C + CO2 Æ 2CO; reverse-
Boudouard reaction).  Figure 1 displays CO2 conversion as a function of the 
pulse number over Ni/Al2O3 catalyst at 773 K.  CO2 conversion decreased with 
the pulse number.

  For the decrease in CO2 conversion observed, following rate analysis is 
possible.  Assuming that the reaction rate of carbon with CO2 is proportional to 
the concentrations of both reactants and that the reverse reaction is negligible 
under the present experimental conditions, we obtain eq. (1). 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-d[m]/dt = kC[CO2][m] 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) 
 
where [m] and [CO2] are the concentrations of carbon on the catalyst and CO2 
in gas phase, respectively, and kC is the rate constant free from any effect of the 
number of active sites on the catalyst.  Since carbon is converted to CO 
according to reaction (I), [m] is expressed by 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[m] = [m]0 – [x]

where [m]0 is [m] at t = 0 and [x] is the concentration of carbon converted to 
CO from reaction with CO2.  From eqs (1) and (2),  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d[x]/dt = kC [CO2]([m]0 – [x]) 
 
 
 
 
 
(3) 
 
In eq. (3), [CO2] can be approximated to the initial concentration of CO2, 
[CO2]0, because CO2 conversion in the pulse reaction was < ca. 12 % (cf. 
Fig. 1).  Integration of eq. (3) leads to 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
[m]0 – [x] = [m]0 exp(– kC [CO2]0 t)  
 
 
 
 
(4) 
 
From eqs (3) and (4),  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
d[x]/dt = kC [CO2]0 [m]0 exp(– kC [CO2]0 t)  
 
 
 
(5) 
 
The reaction time, t, and the number of CO2 molecules in each pulse, ω, can be 
expressed as t = n t0 and ω = [CO2]0 t0 F, respectively, using the pulse number, 
n, the pulse width, t0, and the flow rate of the carrier gas, F [12].  Assuming 
here that d[x] ≈ Δx and dt ≈ t0 where Δx is the number of carbon atoms 
converted to CO, which can be estimated from the number of CO2 reacted, eq. 
(6) is derived from eq. (5);  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Δx = {(kC ω [m]0)/F}exp{(– kC ω n)/F} 
 
 
 
 
(6) 
 
or in a logarithmic from,  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
ln Δx = ln {(kC ω [m]0)/F} – (kC ω n)/F 
 
 
 
 
 
(7) 
 
Equation (7) indicates that a plot of ln Δx vs. n should give a straight line, from 
the slope of which the rate constant kC can be estimated.  Figure 2 illustrates the 
relationship between ln Δx and n.  A break point was present in the relationship 
in a way that one straight line is for the pulse number from 1 to 3 and the other 
from 4 to 8.  A following explanation is possible: reaction between deposited 
carbon and CO2 is responsible for the former straight line, while CO2 
dissociation to CO and Oads-Ni is for the latter.  This is because the slope of the 
latter straight line is found to be almost the same as that for the case of CO2 
pulse onto the Ni catalyst with no carbon deposition [12].  The rate constant, 
kC, thus determined is summarized in Fig. 3 as an Arrhenius plot.  Very little 
difference was observed from one catalyst to another, which indicates that the 
catalyst support hardly influences the gasification rate.  The activation energy 
was calculated as 41.8 kJ mol−1.

  Yamada et al. studied the catalytic activity of physically mixed Ni 
compounds such as NiO, Ni3CO3(OH)44H2O, Ni(NO3)26H2O, NiC2O42H2O, 
and Ni(CH3CO2)24H2O for the CO2 gasification of phenol-formaldehyde resin 
char [13].  Correlation was observed between the catalytic activity and the 
reducibility of a nickel salt, which indicates that metallic nickel, rather than 
nickel oxide, is active sites responsible for carbon gasification.   
  Concerning factors influencing the rate of carbon gasification, following 
two are considered [14]: (i) the degree of contact between the catalyst and 
carbon, and (ii) the chemical nature of a catalyst and/or a catalyst support.  
Moulijn et al. investigated the kinetics of carbon–NOX reaction over solid 
catalysts [15].  The rate of carbon gasification by NOX was much faster for 
samples with a strong contact between the catalyst and carbon than those with a 
loose one.  In our study, however, since carbon was deposited on Ni from CH4 
decomposition, there was no difference in the degree of contact among catalysts 
examined.  Therefore, the influence of the catalyst support on carbon 
gasification is studied here among Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2.   
  As observed in a previous study, CO2 dissociation on Ni was significantly 
influenced by the kind of the oxide support [12], i.e., among oxides, TiO2 
played an important role in the dissociation.  The enhancing effect by TiO2 was 
considered as a result of the extended electronic interaction between Ni and n-
type TiO2.  Electrons may flow from n-type TiO2 to Ni at the interface, and as a 
result of back donation of electrons from Ni to π* orbital of CO2, the formation 
of negatively charged CO2 would be increased, and consequently, CO2 
dissociation should be enhanced [16, 17].  In the present carbon-CO2 reaction, 
however, such a support effect was not observed.  The gasification rate was not 
significantly influenced by the kind of oxide supports as shown in Fig. 3.  This 
might be due to the relatively weak interaction between CO2 and Ni on TiO2.  
Further studies are still necessary to clarify the uncertain discussions.   
  To confirm the validity of the present rate analysis, the reaction rates were 
compared with those obtained previously [7].  The rates were calculated from 
the decay curve for the weight of carbon measured by TG.  A constant amount 
of methane was pulsed onto the Ni catalyst in a TG apparatus to deposit carbon, 
followed by supplying CO2 at a constant flow rate.  Also in the rate analysis, (i) 
very little support effect was observed among Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2, and (ii) 
the activation energies were ca. 46 kJ/mol for all catalysts, indicating a good 
agreement with the present results.  The agreement strongly suggests the 
validity of the new rate analysis for carbon-CO2 reaction.  The activation 
energies are ca. 38-67 kJ/mol forMoO2 [18], ca. 100-120 kJ/mol for Co [19], 
ca. 96-120 kJ/mol for Ni [19], ca. 92-150 kJ/mol for Fe [19], and ca. 297 
kJ/mol for K [20].  The activation energy may strongly be influenced not only 
by the kind of catalyst but also by the contact degree between carbon and

catalyst, as discussed above.  The difference in the activation energy for Ni 
between ref. [19] and the present study might be ascribed to such contact 
degree difference.
