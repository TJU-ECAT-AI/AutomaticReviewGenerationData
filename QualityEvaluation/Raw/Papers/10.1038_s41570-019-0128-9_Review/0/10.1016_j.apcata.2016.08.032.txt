Catalysts
 containing
 4.5  wt%
 cobalt  supported
 on  single
 oxides
 of
 SiO2,
 Al2O3,  TiO2 and  ZrO2 and  on
mixed
 ones
 of  SiO2-Al2O3,  SiO2-TiO2,
 SiO2-ZrO2 and TiO2-ZrO2 were  produced
 in a
 single  step  by  ﬂame
spray
 pyrolysis
 and  tested
 in
 the  CO2-assisted
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of  ethane
 in a
 continuous
ﬁxed-bed
 microreactor.
 Structural
 and  chemical
 properties
 of the  nonporous
 catalysts
 were character-
ized
 by nitrogen
 adsorption,
 XRD,
 HR-TEM,
 EDXS,
 NH3-TPD,  H2-TPR,  TGA,  DRIFTS,
 XPS
 and  Raman
 and
UV–vis
 spectroscopy.
 Depending
 on  the  supporting
 oxides  the  reducibility
 of
 the  cobalt  species
 varied
in
 a broad  range,  indicating
 vastly
 different
 interaction
 of  the  cobalt
 species
 with  the  oxidic  support.
 For
catalysts
 supported
 on  Al2O3 and SiO2-Al2O3 no  signiﬁcant
 H2 consumption
 was
 observed  up  to  840 ◦C,
while
 ZrO2-supported
 CoOx was  already
 reduced
 at  T <500 ◦C.  The  silica-supported
 catalysts
 showed
 a
broad
 reduction
 peak
 at  ∼780 ◦C  attributed
 to  well  dispersed
 CoOx embedded
 in  the
 SiO2 matrix
 forming
cobalt
 silicate,  consistent
 with  HR-TEM,
 XPS  and UV–vis  analyses.
 Among
 all  catalysts,
 silica-supported
cobalt
 showed
 the
 best  catalytic
 performance
 under
 the  test  conditions
 used  (700 ◦C with  CO2/C2H6 =  2.5).
Admixing
 Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2 to SiO2 did not  result
 in  improved
 catalytic
 performance.
 Reducibility of
the
 CoOx species  as  well  as  the  strength
 and  surface
 density
 of  acidic  sites  were  identiﬁed
 as  crucial
 cat-
alyst
 properties
 for  optimal
 ethene
 yield.  Control
 of the  surface
 acidity  seems
 particularly
 important
 to
avoid
 undesired
 side  reactions
 (cracking,
 coking)
 impairing
 activity
 and selectivity.
 Parametric
 sensitivity
studies
 of the  silica  supported
 cobalt  catalyst,
 including
 reaction  temperature,
 CO2/C2H6 feed  ratio  and
space
 velocity,
 revealed
 the  important
 role  of  CO2.  In  the  absence
 of  CO2,  only  low  C2H6 conversion
 was
observed
 and  change
 of  the  oxidant
 to O2 resulted
 in  poorer
 catalytic  performance.

 Introduction
Increasing
 demand
 for
 ethene
 (C2H4)
 derivatives
 such
 as
polyethene,
 ethene
 oxide,
 ethylbenzene
 and
 many
 more
 has
 made
ethene
 one
 of
 the
 main
 chemical
 feedstocks
 in
 the
 chemical
 indus-
try
 [1,2].
 Conventionally,
 ethene
 is
 made
 by
 naphtha
 and
 ethane
(C2H6)
 cracking,
 both
 energy
 intensive
 processes
 that
 promote
 high
rate
 of
 coke
 deposition,
 a
 continuous
 operation
 hurdle,
 apart
 from
high
 CO2 emission
 [3,4].
 Recently,
 ethane
 cracking
 has
 signiﬁcantly
picked
 up
 the
 pace,
 due
 to
 current
 growth
 in
 discoveries
 of
 natu-
ral
 gas,
 especially
 shale
 gas
 in
 the
 US,
 making
 it
 a
 cheap
 feed
 for
ethene
 production
 [5].
 The
 aforementioned
 inherent
 problems
 of
these
 processes
 can
 be
 tackled
 by
 developing
 a
 relatively
 low
 tem-
perature
 catalytic
 process.

(ODHE)
 [6]
 takes
 place
 at
 lower
 temperatures
 where
 oxidants
 such
as
 oxygen
 [7],
 carbon
 dioxide
 [8]
 and
 nitrous
 oxide
 [9]
 are
 utilized.
However,
 O2 results
 in
 an
 exothermic
 reaction
 requiring
 efﬁcient
heat
 removal
 and
 it
 also
 easily
 oxidizes
 ethane,
 whereas
 utilizing
N2O
 in
 large
 scale,
 is
 rather
 challenging
 due
 to
 its
 limited
 availabil-
ity.
 Therefore,
 CO2,
 a
 greenhouse
 gas,
 comes
 as
 an
 obvious
 choice
due
 to
 its
 high
 availability
 and
 relatively
 low
 cost
 [10].
Studies
 on
 ODHE
 employing
 CO2 have
 been
 reported
 over
Cr2O3-
 [11,12]
 and
 Ga2O3-based
 [13–15]
 catalysts,
 where
 the
former
 showed
 superior
 activity.
 However,
 the
 use
 of
 Cr2O3 is
 prob-
lematic
 due
 to
 toxicity
 issues
 while
 Ga2O3 is
 relatively
 expensive
and
 shows
 severe
 sintering
 and
 coking.
 The
 latter
 metal
 oxide
 has
been
 reported
 to
 exhibit
 higher
 activity
 compared
 to
 that
 of
 the
 for-
mer
 [16].
 But
 when
 supported
 on
 generic
 supports
 (e.g.
 Al2O3,
 SiO2
etc)
 [8,17],
 the
 observed
 activity
 was
 reversed,
 i.e.
 the
 Cr-based
 cat-
alyst
 was
 superior.
 One
 of
 the
 issues
 that
 crippled
 the
 performance
of
 Ga3O3-based
 catalyst
 is
 high
 rate
 of
 coke
 deposition
 resulting
in
 gradual
 and
 early
 deactivation
 [17],
 requiring
 frequent

eration
 [13].
 By
 tuning
 the
 acidity
 and
 basicity
 of
 the
 catalyst,
 to
some
 extent,
 the
 coke
 deposition
 has
 been
 minimized
 [15],
 how-
ever,
 the
 necessity
 of
 catalyst
 regeneration
 seemed
 to
 be
 inevitable.
The
 reported
 initial
 ethane
 conversion
 and
 ethene
 selectivity
 over
Ga2O3-based
 catalysts
 are
 in
 the
 range
 of
 20–30%
 and
 80–90%,
respectively,
 which
 gradually
 decrease,
 primarily
 ethane
 conver-
sion,
 with
 time
 [17,18].
 In
 contrast,
 relatively
 high
 and
 stable
 ethane
conversion
 of
 around
 50%
 and
 ethene
 selectivity
 of
 >90%
 were
obtained
 over
 SiO2-supported
 Cr2O3 compared
 to
 that
 of
 other
 sup-
ported
 catalysts
 (e.g.
 Al2O3,
 TiO2,
 and
 ZrO2)
 [8].
 The
 observed
 high
activity
 was
 attributed
 to
 the
 redox
 property
 and
 acidity/basicity
of
 the
 Cr2O3/SiO2.
 Some
 improvement
 on
 the
 Cr2O3/SiO2 activity
has
 been
 achieved
 by
 addition
 of
 acidic
 and
 basic
 oxide
 promoters
[19].
Cobalt
 oxide
 based
 catalysts
 are
 attractive
 for
 oxidative
 dehy-
drogenation
 of
 ethane
 [20–22],
 propane
 [23,24]
 and
 isobutene
 [25]
using
 O2 and
 also
 for
 dry
 reforming
 of
 methane
 [26,27].
 Li
 et
 al.
[28]
 used
 3%Co-MCM-41
 with
 CO2 as
 oxidant
 and
 reported
 ethane
conversion
 of
 about
 40%
 with
 a
 selectivity
 of
 99%.
 Zhang
 et
 al.
 [29]
found
 7%
 Co
 loading
 on
 BaCO3 to
 be
 optimal
 with
 a
 very
 stable
 (>5
 h)
ethane
 conversion
 of
 48%
 at
 a
 C2H4 selectivity
 of
 92%.
 The
 high
activity
 and
 the
 stable
 performance
 was
 attributed
 to
 the
 redox
property
 of
 CoOx as
 well
 as
 synergism
 between
 BaCO3 and
 BaCoO3.
The
 support
 characteristics
 have
 major
 inﬂuence
 on
 the
 perfor-
mance
 in
 ODHE,
 as
 has
 been
 shown
 for
 Cr2O3-
 [8]
 and
 Ga2O3-based
[17]
 catalysts.
 To
 our
 knowledge,
 there
 exists
 no
 systematic
 study
of
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 of
 single
 and
 mixed
 oxide
 supported
cobalt
 catalysts
 on
 CO2-assisted
 ODHE.
 With
 this
 in
 mind,
 we  inves-
tigated
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 single
 and
 mixed-oxide
 supports
 on
 the
performance
 of
 Co-based
 ODHE
 catalysts.
 A
 scalable
 single-step
ﬂame
 spray
 pyrolysis
 (FSP)
 method
 was
 used
 for
 their
 preparation
[30].
 This
 synthesis
 technique
 is
 ﬂexible,
 easily
 operable
 and
 offers
high
 possibility
 of
 metastable
 phase
 formation
 due
 to
 which
 rapid
growth
 in
 its
 utilization
 for
 catalyst
 synthesis
 is
 observed
 in
 recent
years
 [31].
In
 this
 comparative
 study
 we
 report
 the
 physicochemical
properties
 of
 ﬂame-made
 single
 and
 mixed-oxide
 supported
 Co
 cat-
alysts
 and
 their
 performance
 in
 ODHE
 using
 CO2 as
 a
 mild
 oxidant.
The
 physicochemical
 properties
 of
 the
 catalysts
 were
 analyzed
 by
nitrogen
 adsorption,
 XRD,
 HR-TEM,
 EDXS,
 NH3-TPD,
 TPR,
 DRIFTS,
XPS
 and
 Raman-
 and
 UV–vis
 spectroscopy
 and
 crucial
 properties
for
 optimal
 catalytic
 performance
 were
 identiﬁed.

 Experimental
2.1.
 Catalyst
 preparation
All
 catalysts
 were
 made
 by
 FSP
 [13].
 Brieﬂy,
 precursor
 solutions
were
 prepared
 by
 mixing
 appropriate
 amounts
 of
 metal-precursors
in
 toluene
 (Sigma
 Aldrich),
 except
 for
 catalysts
 containing
 (a)
 Al2O3,
where
 diethylene
 glycol
 monobutyl
 ether
 (Sigma–Aldrich)
 and
acetic
 anhydride
 (Sigma-Aldrich)
 (vol.
 ratio
 of
 2:1)
 and
 (b)
 ZrO2,
where
 a
 mixture
 of
 toluene,
 2-ethylhexanoate
 (Sigma-Aldrich,
purity
 >99%)
 and
 acetonitrile
 (Sigma-Aldrich,
 purity
 >99.5%)
 at
vol.
 ratio
 of
 3:1:1
 were
 used.
 All
 the
 metal
 precursors,
 cobalt
(III)
 acetylacetonate
 (98%),
 hexamethyldisiloxane
 (≥98%),
 titanium
iso-propoxide
 (>97%
 purity)
 and
 aluminum
 tri-sec-butoxide
 (97%
purity)
 from
 Sigma-Aldrich
 and
 zirconium
 2-ethylhexanoate
 (∼6%
Zr)
 from
 Strem
 chemicals,
 were
 used
 as
 received.
 The
 total
 molar
concentration
 of
 metal
 (i.e.
 Co
 +
 metal
 in
 support(s))
 was
 set
 to
0.45
 M
 except
 for
 Zr-containing
 catalysts
 where
 the
 molarity
 was
set
 to
 0.31
 M
 due
 to
 solubility
 limitation.
 When
 preparing
 mixed-
oxide
 supports,
 both
 oxides
 were
 of
 equivalent
 weight
 (i.e.
 1:1
 ratio
of
 95.5
 wt%).
 The
 cobalt
 content
 was
 always
 4.5
 wt%.
 During
 FSP,
 the
precursor
 solution
 was
 pumped
 at
 5
 mL/min
 into
 the
 ﬂame
 reac-
tor
 nozzle
 using
 a
 syringe
 pump
 (Lambda,
 VIT-FIT).
 The
 feed
 was
dispersed
 into
 ﬁne
 droplets
 by
 co-ﬂowed
 O2 of
 5
 L/min
 (>99.9%
 Pan-
Gas)
 and
 immediately
 ignited
 by
 a
 pilot
 ﬂame
 fed
 by
 CH4/O2 of
1/2
 L/min
 (>99.9%
 PanGas).
 The
 pressure
 drop
 at
 the
 nozzle-tip
 was
maintained
 at
 2
 bar.
 Product
 powders
 were
 collected
 on
 glass
 ﬁber
ﬁlter
 (ALBET
 GF
 6,
 25.7
 cm
 in
 diameter)
 with
 the
 aid
 of
 a
 vacuum
pump
 (Busch,
 Seco
 SV
 1040C).
 All
 gas
 ﬂow
 rates
 were
 regulated
 by
mass
 ﬂow
 controllers
 (Bronkhorst).
2.2.
 Catalyst
 characterization
X-ray
 diffractograms
 were
 recorded
 on
 a
 Bruker
 D8
 Advance
diffractometer
 (40
 kV,
 20
 mA,
 Cu
 K)
 over
 the
 2
 range
 of
 10–70◦
with
 a
 step
 size
 of
 0.019◦and
 scan
 speed
 of
 0.1
 s/step.
 Nitrogen
adsorption-desorption
 isotherms
 were
 measured
 on
 a
 Micromerit-
ics
 Tristar
 instrument
 and
 the
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 (SSA)
 of
 both
fresh
 and
 spent
 catalyst
 powders
 was
 determined
 by
 applying
 the
Brunauer-Emmett-Teller
 (BET)
 method
 at
 77
 K.
 All
 samples
 were
kept
 at
 150 ◦C
 in
 N2-atmosphere
 for
 1
 h
 prior
 to
 measurements.
Micromeritics
 Autochem
 2920
 was
 used
 for
 H2-temperature
programmed
 
reduction
 
(H2-TPR)
 
and
 
NH3-temperature
 
pro-
grammed
 desorption
 (NH3-TPD).
 For
 all
 measurements,
 a
 sample
mass
 of
 ca.
 100
 mg,
 a
 temperature
 ramp
 rate
 of
 10 ◦C/min
 and
 total
gas
 ﬂow
 rate
 of
 20
 mL/min
 were
 applied.
 The
 NH3-TPD
 was
 per-
formed
 by
 heating
 the
 sample
 from
 room
 temperature
 to
 400 ◦C
 in
5%
 O2 in
 He
 and
 maintaining
 it
 at
 this
 temperature
 for
 2
 h
 before
cooling
 down
 to
 50 ◦C
 in
 helium.
 Then,
 the
 gas
 ﬂow
 was
 switched
 to
10%
 NH3 in
 Ar,
 which
 was
 passed
 over
 the
 sample
 for
 90
 min.
 Tem-
perature
 was
 increased
 to
 100 ◦C
 and
 the
 gas
 ﬂow
 switched
 back
 to
helium
 to
 remove
 physisorbed
 NH3 from
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 sample.
Finally,
 the
 temperature
 was
 ramped
 to
 840 ◦C
 and
 the
 desorbed
NH3 was
 monitored
 by
 a
 mass
 spectrometer
 (m/z
 =
 15).
 For
 H2-TPR
measurements,
 the
 samples
 were
 heated
 from
 room
 temperature
to
 200 ◦C
 in
 helium
 and
 held
 at
 this
 temperature
 for
 2
 h
 before
cooling
 down
 to
 50 ◦C.
 Then
 the
 gas
 ﬂow
 was
 switched
 to
 5%H2/Ar
before
 ramping
 to
 840 ◦C.
 The
 H2-consumption
 was
 monitored
 by
a
 mass
 spectrometer
 (m/z
 =
 2).
Diffuse
 reﬂectance
 infrared
 Fourier
 transform
 spectroscopy
(DRIFTS)
 of
 all
 fresh
 catalysts
 was
 performed
 on
 a
 Vertex
 70
 v
 spec-
trometer
 (Bruker
 Optics).
 The
 powder
 samples
 were
 placed
 in
 an
in-situ
 DRIFTS
 cell
 that
 was
 heated
 to
 400 ◦C
 in
 5%O2 in
 He
 at
20
 mL/min
 and
 held
 at
 this
 temperature
 for
 30
 min.
 After
 cooling
down
 to
 40 ◦C
 in
 helium
 at
 20
 mL/min,
 background
 (sample
 +
 KBr)
was
 taken
 and
 then
 the
 gas
 was
 switched
 to
 10%
 NH3/Ar,
 which
 was
passed
 over
 the
 sample
 for
 15
 min.
 Afterward
 the
 weakly
 adsorbed
NH3 was
 ﬂushed
 by
 helium
 for
 15
 min
 before
 measuring
 the
 spec-
tra.
UV–vis
 diffuse
 reﬂectance
 spectra
 (Cary
 500
 UV–vis-NIR
 Spec-
trophotometer)
 were
 recorded
 from
 300
 to
 800
 nm
 for
 the
 fresh
supported
 Co-catalysts
 and
 bare
 single
 metal
 oxides.
 The
 samples
were
 diluted
 with
 BaSO4 keeping
 constant
 the
 mass
 ratio
 of
 the
sample
 and
 BaSO4 and
 spectra
 were
 measured
 against
 a
 BaSO4
background.
 Raman
 (Renishaw
 InVia
 Raman
 microscope)
 spectra
of
 both
 fresh
 and
 spent
 catalysts
 were
 obtained
 using
 a
 785
 nm
laser
 with
 5%
 of
 the
 laser
 power
 (500
 mW)
 and
 an
 exposure
 time
 of
10
 s.
 Accumulation
 of
 spectra
 was
 set
 to
 20
 for
 better
 resolution.
XPS
 measurements
 were
 performed
 using
 a
 VG
 ESCALAB
 220iXL
spectrometer
 (Thermo
 Fisher
 Scientiﬁc)
 with
 monochromatic
 Al
 K
source
 (spot
 size:
 500
 m,
 power:
 150
 W).
 The
 powder
 samples
were
 placed
 on
 an
 adhesive
 copper
 tape
 which
 was
 mounted
 on
 a
stainless
 steel
 holder
 that
 was
 later
 transferred
 to
 the
 instrument
chamber
 and
 kept
 under
 vacuum.
 In
 built
 electron
 and
 ion
 neu-
tralizers
 were
 used
 to
 compensate
 the
 charge
 generated
 from
 the
samples.
 The
 spectra
 were
 recorded
 in
 constant
 analyzer
 energy
 of
30
 eV.
 The
 XPS
 system
 was
 calibrated
 using
 the
 Ag
 3d5/2,
 the
 Cu
2p3/2 and
 the
 Au
 4f7/2 peaks.

 was
 quantiﬁed
 using
 a

 (TGA/SDTA851e,

 A

 was
 passed
over
 the

 to

 Approximately
20
 mg of
 each

 was
 taken
 for
 the

2.3.
 Catalyst
 testing
The
 catalysts
 were
 tested
 at
 atmospheric
 pressure
 in
 a
 tubu-
lar
 continuous
 ﬂow
 reactor
 with
 4
 mm
 inner
 diameter
 that
 was
contracted
 to
 2
 mm
 after
 the
 catalyst
 bed.
 Prior
 to
 use,
 the
catalyst
 powders
 were
 pelletized,
 crushed
 and
 sieved,

ing
 a
 80–140
 m
 size

 Mixtures
 of
 150
 mg
 of
 catalyst
(80–140

 50
 mg  SiC
 (160–190
 m)
 were
 used
 to
 establish
 a
catalyst
 bed,
 which
 was
 ﬁxed
 at
 the
 center
 using
 quartz
 wool
 [32].
The
 tubular
 reactor
 was
 placed
 in
 a
 temperature-controlled
 electri-
cally
 heated
 furnace
 which
 was
 ramped
 (10 ◦C/min)
 to
 the
 desired

 (typically
 700 ◦C).

 Crystallinity,
 surface
 area
 and
 morphology
The
 ﬂame-made
 catalytic
 powders
 were
 nonporous
 as
 evi-
denced
 by
 their
 nitrogen
 adsorption-desorption
 isotherms
 (Fig.
S1)
 [13]. Particle
 formation
 in
 ﬂame
 depends
 on
 the
 volatility
 of
the
 materials
 i.e.
 material
 with
 high
 melting
 temperature
 con-
denses
 ﬁrst
 [31,33].
 Therefore
 since
 the
 cobalt
 oxide
 is
 more
 volatile
than
 other
 metal
 oxides,
 cobalt
 constituents
 must
 be
 preferentially
located
 at
 the
 outer
 surface
 of
 the
 catalysts.
 This
 postulate
 is
 also
supported
 by
 the
 XPS
 analysis,
 which
 will
 be
 discussed
 later.
 Fig.
 1a
shows
 the
 XRD
 patterns
 of
 fresh
 powders
 containing
 4.5
 wt%
 Co
supported
 on
 SiO2,
 Al2O3,
 TiO2,
 ZrO2 and
 corresponding
 mixed
oxide
 supports.
 The
 SiO2-
 and
 SiO2-Al2O3-supported
 catalysts
 were
XRD-amorphous
 while
 -Al2O3 patterns
 were
 observed
 with
 pure
Al2O3 support.
 As
 XRD
 reﬂections
 of
 -Al2O3 and
 CoAl2O4 are
similar,
 small
 amounts
 of
 CoAl2O4 could
 be
 present
 [34].
 In
 TiO2-
supported
 catalyst,
 both
 anatase
 and
 rutile
 TiO2 reﬂections
 were
observed
 with
 the
 latter
 being
 dominant,
 indicating
 that
 cobalt
 pro-
motes
 rutilization.
 This
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 substitution
 of
 Co3+
(0.55
 Å)
 into
 the
 Ti4+ (0.61
 Å)
 lattice,
 due
 to
 the
 difference
 in
 their
ionic
 radii
 [35]
 similar
 to
 Al3+ substitution
 of
 Ti4+ [36].
 The
 intensity
of
 anatase
 and
 rutile
 reﬂections
 is
 lower
 in
 the
 SiO2-TiO2-supported
catalyst
 than
 for
 the
 TiO2-supported
 catalyst,
 because
 SiO2 sup-
presses
 TiO2 crystallization
 and/or
 there
 is
 a
 signiﬁcant
 amorphous
fraction.
 In
 the
 ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 essentially
 all
 reﬂections
can
 be
 assigned
 to
 tetragonal
 zirconia
 (t-ZrO2).
 Slightly
 broader
reﬂections
 implying
 smaller
 crystallite
 size
 were
 observed
 in
 SiO2-
ZrO2-supported
 catalysts,
 a
 similar
 action
 to
 Si-doping
 of
 TiO2 and
SnO2 where
 amorphous
 interstitial
 Si
 leads
 to
 smaller
 crystals
 and
blocks
 crystal
 growth
 during
 their
 co-oxidation.
 In
 the
 TiO2-ZrO2-
supported
 catalyst,
 only
 reﬂections
 corresponding
 to
 the
 mixed
oxide
 phase,
 (ZrTiO4)
 srilankite
 [37],
 were
 observed.
 No
 reﬂections
belonging
 to
 the
 crystalline
 TiO2 and
 ZrO2 were
 observed
 but
 their
presence
 in
 amorphous
 form
 and/or
 as
 very
 small
 crystals
 cannot
be
 ruled
 out.

After
 ODHE
 at
 standard
 conditions,
 only
 the
 XRD
 patterns
 of
TiO2-
 and
 ZrO2-supported
 catalysts
 were
 changed
 (Fig.
 1b).
 In
 such
spent
 TiO2-supported
 catalyst
 the
 anatase
 phase
 was
 transformed
to
 rutile
 TiO2. Its
 reﬂection
 was
 narrower
 than
 in
 the
 fresh
 sam-
ple,
 indicating
 crystal
 growth.
 In
 the
 spent
 ZrO2-supported
 catalyst,
the
 majority
 of
 t-ZrO2 was
 transformed
 to
 larger
 monoclinic
 (m)
crystals.
 The
 high
 resistance
 towards
 sintering
 of
 the
 Al2O3-,
 SiO2-
and
 their
 corresponding
 mixed
 oxide-supported
 catalysts
 can
 be
attributed
 to
 the
 intrinsic
 thermal
 stability
 of
 these
 oxides
 or
 large
amorphous
 fraction.
 No
 reﬂections
 of
 CoOx and
 its
 mixed
 oxide
were
 detected
 in
 fresh
 and
 spent
 catalysts,
 indicating
 their
 high
dispersion
 or
 rather
 amorphous
 state.
Fig.
 2
 shows
 the
 SSA
 of
 fresh
 and
 spent
 catalysts.
 The
 SSA
 of
all
 catalysts
 decreased
 after
 standard
 ODHE
 test.
 The
 decrease
 was
most
 signiﬁcant
 for
 TiO2-
 and
 ZrO2-supported
 catalysts,
 whereas
both
 SiO2-
 and
 Al2O3-supported
 catalysts
 showed
 remarkable
resistance
 towards
 sintering,
 in
 agreement
 with
 XRD
 (Fig.
 1).
 The
SSA
 of
 fresh
 TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 was
 similar
 to
 that
 of
 the
corresponding
 fresh
 single
 oxide
 supported
 catalysts
 (∼110
 m2/g).
However,
 the
 decrease
 in
 SSA
 was
 smaller
 in
 the
 case
 of
 the
mixed
 metal
 oxides
 supported
 catalyst
 (48
 m2/g)
 due
 to
 the
 for-
mation
 of
 the
 thermally
 stable
 srilankite
 phase
 (Fig.
 1)
 [38].
 In
SiO2-containing
 catalysts
 (e.g.
 SiO2-TiO2),
 the
 decrease
 in
 SSA
 after
ODHE
 was
 minimal
 due
 to
 resistance
 of
 SiO2 towards
 sintering.
The
 freshly
 prepared
 catalyst
 powders
 differed
 signiﬁcantly
 in
their
 color
 as
 indicated
 by
 the
 inset
 of
 Fig.
 2.
 The
 catalysts’
 color
also
 conﬁrms
 the
 formation
 of
 cobalt
 containing
 mixed
 oxides
during
 synthesis,
 e.g.
 blue
 in
 SiO2-
 (cobalt
 silicate)
 and
 Al2O3-
(cobalt
 aluminate)
 supported
 catalysts
 [39].
 The
 black
 color
 of
 the
ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 could
 be
 an
 indication
 of
 CoOx species
formation.
 In
 Fig.

 the
 HR-TEM
 images
 of
 fresh
 and
 spent
 SiO2-
supported

 In

 were
 around
 2
 nm
 and
 increased
 to
about

 The

 in

 are
 due
to
 cobalt
 species
 embedded
 in

in
 the

 NH3-TPD
 and
 DRIFTS
NH3-TPD
 measurements
 on
 fresh
 single
 and
 mixed
 oxide
 sup-
ported
 catalysts
 were
 performed
 to
 examine
 acidic
 sites
 on
 their
surfaces
 (Fig.
 4a).
 A
 very
 broad
 NH3-desorption
 signal
 was
 observed
with
 the
 SiO2-supported
 catalyst
 compared
 to
 that
 of
 Al2O3-
 and
TiO2-supported
 ones.
 The
 ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 showed
 the
 nar-
rowest
 low
 temperature
 desorption
 peak
 (around
 200 ◦C)
 among
 all
catalysts.
 The
 SiO2-Al2O3-supported
 catalyst
 possessed
 both
 weak
and
 medium
 acidic
 sites
 (similar
 to
 that
 observed
 for
 the
 Al2O3-
supported
 catalyst)
 beside
 strong
 acidic
 sites,
 indicated
 by
 the
 peak
at
 ∼500 ◦C.
 For
 the
 TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 catalyst,
 the
 NH3 desorp-
tion
 proﬁle
 is
 broader
 than
 that
 of
 the
 ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 and
similar
 to
 that
 of
 the
 TiO2-supported
 catalyst.
Fig.
 4b
 shows
 the
 deconvoluted
 proﬁles
 of
 some
 selected
 cat-
alysts.
 In
 Al2O3-
 and
 SiO2-Al2O3-supported
 catalysts,
 the
 low
temperature
 (100–250 ◦C)
 signal
 was
 composed
 of
 physisorbed
NH3 and
 weakly
 adsorbed
 NH3 at
 Brønsted
 acid
 sites,
 respectively
[40].
 The
 deconvoluted
 peak
 around
 290 ◦C
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
strong
 Lewis
 acid
 sites,
 whereas
 higher
 desorption
 temperatures
can
 be
 attributed
 to
 strong
 Brønsted
 acid
 sites
 [40].
 Among
 single
metal
 oxide
 supported
 catalysts,
 the
 SiO2-supported
 one
 showed
the
 highest
 total
 NH3 uptake
 (210
 mol
 NH3/gcat)
 followed
 by
 those
with
 TiO2,
 Al2O3 and
 ZrO2 supports
 (Table
 1).
 Mixed
 oxide
 supports
showed
 relatively
 higher
 NH3 uptake
 than
 single
 ones.
 However,
when
 the
 amount
 of
 NH3 desorbed
 is
 referred
 to
 the
 catalysts’
SSA,
 different
 tendencies
 are
 observed,
 particularly
 for
 single
 metal
supported
 catalysts
 (Table
 S1).
 Silica-supported
 catalyst
 exhibited
the
 lowest
 surface
 density
 of
 acidic
 sites
 (0.50
 mol
 NH3/m2cat),
whereas
 for
 the
 TiO2-supported
 one
 highest
 value
 was
 measured
(1.8
 mol
 NH3/m2cat).
 High
 surface
 densities
 of
 acidic
 sites
 were
also
 found
 for
 TiO2-ZrO2-
 and
 SiO2-TiO2-supported
 catalysts.
Fig.
 5
 shows
 the
 DRIFT
 spectra
 of
 NH3 adsorbed
 on
 a)
 single
 and
b)
 mixed
 oxide
 supported
 catalysts.
 All
 bands
 at
 3600–3750
 cm−1
can
 be
 attributed
 to
 NH3 reaction
 with
 the
 residual
 OH
 groups
of
 these
 ﬂame-made
 oxides
 [41].
 Multiple
 bands
 in
 the
 range
 of
3100–3500
 cm−1 observed
 in
 SiO2-
 and
 Al2O3-supported
 catalysts
arise
 from
 the
 NH3 stretching
 modes
 on
 the
 support
 [42].
 More-
over,
 both
 catalysts
 showed
 a
 band
 at
 1619
 cm−1 due
 to
 asymmetric
NH3 deformation
 in
 addition
 to
 1282
 (on
 Co/SiO2)
 and
 1242
 cm−1
(on
 Co/Al2O3)
 due
 to
 symmetric
 NH3 deformation.
 Both
 catalysts
contained
 Brønsted
 acid
 sites
 as
 evidenced
 by
 a
 band
 around
1450
 cm−1.
 The
 multiple
 bands
 in
 the
 range
 of
 3100–3500
 cm−1 can
be
 attributed
 to
 the
 stretching
 vibration
 of
 NH3 on
 the
 TiO2 surface
[42].
 The
 bands
 at
 1414
 and
 1540
 cm−1 are
 indicative
 of
 Brønsted
acid
 sites
 and
 the
 existence
 of
 NH2-bending
 vibration,
 respectively
[43],
 and
 1594,
 1158
 and
 1112
 cm−1 of
 Lewis-acid
 centers
 [42].
 The
latter
 doublet
 bands
 are
 due
 to
 inversion
 splitting
 [44].
 The
 bands
at
 1615
 and
 1223
 cm−1 are
 due
 to
 N
 H
 deformation
 and

 cm−1 signals
 related

 are

 [42].
 Addi-
tionally,
 a
 band
 at
 1460
 cm−1 is
 assigned
 to
 Brønsted
 acid
 sites
[42].
The
 spectra
 in
 the
 NH3-stretching
 range
 of
 3100–3400
 cm−1 for
mixed
 oxide
 supported
 catalysts
 remained
 similar
 to
 the
 single
oxide
 ones
 (Fig.
 5a).
 A
 broad
 hump
 ranging
 from
 2700
 to
 3100
 cm−1
in
 catalysts
 containing
 SiO2 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 perturbed
 OH
vibrations
 [45]
 in
 Si
 OH·  ·
 ·NH3.
 The
 band
 at
 1464
 cm−1 is
 rela-
tively
 intense
 and
 broader
 than
 that
 of
 single
 oxides,
 indicating
an
 increased
 density
 of
 Brønsted
 acid
 sites.
 Moreover,
 a
 slight
 shift
in
 the
 position
 of
 the
 bands
 belonging
 to
 the
 Lewis
 acid
 sites
 of
Al2O3-,
 TiO2-
 and
 ZrO2-supported
 catalysts
 was
 observed
 upon
introduction
 of
 the
 second
 metal
 oxide,
 an
 indication
 of
 an
 increase
in
 catalyst
 acidity
 [46].
 These
 observations
 are
 in
 agreement
 with
the
 NH3-TPD
 results
 (Table
 1).
3.1.3.

Fig.

 shows

 spectra

 No
 signiﬁcant
signals
 attributable
 to
 Si-O
 stretches
 or
 Al2O3 were
 observed
 in
the
 SiO2-
 and
 SiO2-Al2O3-supported
 catalysts,
 probably
 due
 to
 the
low
 Raman
 scattering
 of
 these
 oxides
 [47].
 A
 very
 small
 signal
at
 693
 cm−1 was
 observed
 with
 the
 Al2O3-supported
 catalyst
 but
could
 not
 be
 assigned
 unambiguously
 due
 to
 the
 similarity
 in
 band
position
 of
 cobalt
 oxide
 and
 CoAl2O4 [48].
 However,
 the
 color
 of
the
 Al2O3-supported
 catalyst
 was
 blue
 (Fig.
 2
 inset)
 indicating
 the
formation
 of
 Co-mixed
 oxides
 [34],
 e.g.
 CoAl2O4,
 consistent
 with
the
 observation
 made
 by
 Høj
 et
 al.
 [34]
 and
 Minnermann
 et
 al.
 [49]
for
 ﬂame-made
 Co-Mo/Al2O3 and
 Co/Al2O3 catalysts,
 respectively.
For
 TiO2-supported
 catalyst
 Raman
 bands
 at
 439
 and
 610
 cm−1
(due
 to
 rutile
 TiO2)
 [50]
 and
 146
 cm−1 (due
 to
 anatase
 TiO2)
 [51],
were
 detected
 in
 agreement
 with
 XRD
 (Fig.
 1a).
 The
 band
 around
250
 cm−1 is
 the
 result
 of
 the
 second-order
 Raman
 scattering
 of
 the
rutile
 structure
 [52].
 For
 the
 ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 [53],
 only
 the
bands
 at
 146,
 266,
 317,
 461
 and
 646
 cm−1 corresponding
 to
 t-ZrO2
were
 observed.
 The
 band
 at
 693
 cm−1 reveals
 the
 presence
 of
 Co3O4
[48].
 In
 the
 SiO2-TiO2-supported
 catalyst,
 the
 band
 at
 447
 cm−1
belonging
 to
 rutile
 TiO2 (rest
 anatase)
 was
 observed
 further
 con-
ﬁrming
 its
 presence
 in
 the
 catalyst.
 The
 absence
 of
 Raman
 bands
 of
the
 SiO2-ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 even
 though
 the
 crystal
 phase
 of
ZrO2 was
 distinctly
 detected
 by
 XRD,
 indicates
 that
 SiO2 impaired
the
 measurement.
 The
 observed
 Raman
 band
 positions
 of
 the
 TiO2-
ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 are
 different
 than
 those
 of
 the
 TiO2-
 and
ZrO2-supported
 catalysts,
 further
 conﬁrming
 the
 formation
 of
 a
mixed
 oxide
 phase
 [54],
 namely,
 ZrTiO4 (srilankite)
 [55], as
 was
indicated
 by
 XRD
 (Fig.
 1a).
 The
 bands
 at
 286,
 326,
 414
 and
 634
 cm−1
can
 be
 assigned
 to
 ZrTiO4 [55].
 The
 broad
 band
 around
 146
 cm−1
could
 be
 an
 overlap
 of
 anatase
 TiO2,
 t-ZrO2 and
 ZrTiO4 (∼160
 cm−1)
due
 their
 close
 proximity.
Raman
 spectroscopy
 of
 most
 spent
 catalysts
 showed
 features
similar
 to
 the
 fresh
 ones
 with
 only
 a
 slight
 change
 mainly
 due
 to
ﬂuorescence
 (Fig.
 6b).
 Signiﬁcant
 changes
 were
 observed
 only
 for
spent
 TiO2-
 and
 ZrO2-supported
 catalysts.
 New
 bands
 at
 236,

 spectra
 of
 a)
 pure
 single
 metal
 oxides,
b)
 Co-containing
 single
 metal
 oxides
 and
 c)
 Co-containing
 mixed
metal
 oxides.
 Fairly
 ﬂat
 (400–800
 nm)
 spectra
 were
 obtained
 with
pure
 single
 metal
 oxide
 supports
 (Fig.
 7a).
 Therefore,
 the
 observed
changes
 in
 the
 spectra
 of
 Fig.
 7b,c
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 CoOx
and/or
 its
 interaction
 with
 the
 support.
 Flame-made
 pure
 CoOx
exhibited
 bands
 around
 400
 and
 710
 nm
 (Fig.
 7a),
 close
 to
 the
reported
 values
 of
 around
 430
 and
 720
 nm
 for
 Co3O4 [22].
 In
 all
catalysts
 containing
 TiO2,
 red-shifting
 of
 its
 band
 at
 300–400
 nm
is
 observed
 that
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 TiO2 rutilization
 by
 cobalt.
A
 broad
 feature
 is
 observed
 in
 the
 range
 of
 575–735
 nm,
 which
can
 be
 assigned
 to
 CoTiO3 [59].
 A
 similar
 feature
 (500–700
 nm)
was
 also
 observed
 with
 the
 TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 indi-
cating
 the
 formation
 of
 mixed
 oxide
 in
 accordance
 with
 XRD
(Fig.
 1).
 Two
 broad
 signals
 around
 380
 and
 690
 nm
 were
 observed
with
 the
 ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 that
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 CoOx.
These
 signals
 were
 absent
 in
 other
 catalysts.
 However,
 since
relatively
 high
 H2-uptake
 was
 observed
 over
 TiO2-
 and
 TiO2-ZrO2-
supported
 catalysts
 (Table
 1),
 the
 features
 of
 CoOx could
 have
been
 overlapped/suppressed
 by
 bands
 from
 other
 structures.
 More
speciﬁcally,
 the
 ﬁrst
 signal
 from
 CoOx (around
 380
 nm)
 is
 clearly
masked
 by
 the
 TiO2 absorption
 spectrum,
 whereas
 the
 absence
 of
the
 second
 signal
 (around
 690
 nm)
 is
 likely
 due
 to
 different
 interac-
tion
 of
 CoOx with
 TiO2 and
 TiO2-ZrO2 compared
 to
 that
 with
 ZrO2,
which
 will
 be
 discussed
 later.
 Three
 distinct
 bands
 were
 observed
around
 520,
 590
 and
 635
 nm
 and
 540,
 580
 and
 630
 nm
 with
 SiO2-
and
 Al2O3-supported
 catalysts,
 respectively.
 The
 structural
 feature
of
 SiO2-ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 was
 similar
 to
 that
 of
 the
 SiO2-
supported
 one.
 The
 SiO2-TiO2-supported
 catalyst
 showed
 spectral
features
 (3
 bands)
 similar
 to
 that
 of
 SiO2-
 supported
 one.
 Such
 spec-
tral
 features
 of
 the
 single
 metal
 oxide
 supported
 catalysts
 (Al2O3
and
 SiO2)
 are
 attributed
 to
 the
 three
 spin
 allowed
 d–d
 transitions
 of
tetrahedrally
 coordinated
 Co2+ in
 Co-aluminate
 [60]
 and
 Co-silicate
species
 [61].
 The
 absence
 of
 octahedral
 Co3+ species
 indicates
 that
ﬂame
 synthesis
 favors
 formation
 of
 tetrahedral
 species
 incorpo-
rated
 into
 the
 Al2O3 [34]-
 and
 SiO2 [62]-matrix.
H2-TPR
 proﬁles
 of
 all
 as-prepared
 catalysts
 are
 presented
 in
Fig.
 8
 along
 with
 deconvolution
 of
 the
 SiO2-,
 ZrO2-
 and
 TiO2-ZrO2-
supported
 ones.
 Signiﬁcant
 differences
 in
 the
 reduction
 proﬁles
indicate
 that
 the
 oxidation
 state
 and
 the
 interaction
 of
 the
 cobalt
species
 strongly
 depend
 on
 support
 composition.
 For
 Co3O4 gener-
ally,
 a
 two-step
 reduction
 is
 observed:
 Co3O4 →
 CoO
 and
 CoO
 →
 Co
[63].
 This
 was
 also
 conﬁrmed
 by
 TPR
 over
 mechanically
 mixed
 com-
mercial
 Co3O4 (Sigma
 Aldrich)
 with
 ﬂame-made
 SiO2 (90
 wt%)
 (not
shown).
 The
 powder
 prepared
 by
 mechanical
 mixing
 showed
 a
broad
 reduction
 peak
 ranging
 from
 200
 to
 450 ◦C.
 Generally,
 rela-
tively
 strong
 interaction
 between
 the
 CoOx species
 and
 the
 support
was
 observed
 with
 all
 catalysts,
 indicated
 by
 a
 shift
 of
 the
 reduction
peaks
 to
 higher
 temperatures
 (>
 450 ◦C)
 [63].
The
 silica-supported
 catalyst
 could
 only
 be
 reduced
 above
750 ◦C,
 indicating
 strong
 interaction
 between
 cobalt
 oxide
 and
 sil-
ica,
 most
 likely
 due
 to
 formation
 of
 cobalt
 silicate
 [64].
 A
 distinct
shoulder
 was
 observed
 (∼820 ◦C),
 indicating
 the
 existence
 of
 dif-
ferent
 types
 of
 interactions
 between
 CoOx and
 SiO2.

peaks
 were
 observed
 in
 both
 the
 Al2O3-
 and
 SiO2-Al2O3-supported
catalysts,
 which
 could
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 possible
 formation
 of
CoAl2O4 that
 can
 only
 be
 reduced
 above
 900 ◦C
 [34,65].
 The
 high
temperature
 reduction
 peak
 (∼600 ◦C)
 of
 the
 TiO2-supported
 cata-
lyst
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 strong
 binding
 between
 CoOx and
 rutile
TiO2 [66].
For
 ZrO2-supported
 catalysts
 the
 low
 temperature
 reduction
peak
 (around
 200 ◦C)
 can
 be
 assigned
 to
 nano-sized
 easily
 reducible
surface
 Co3O4 species
 [67].
 The
 high
 temperature
 reduction
 peak
was
 shifted
 to
 higher
 temperature
 (around
 500 ◦C)
 compared
 to
that
 of
 pure
 commercial
 Co3O4 (around
 400 ◦C),
 which
 can
 be
ascribed
 to
 the
 reduction
 of
 strongly
 bound
 CoOx on
 the
 ZrO2 sur-
face
 [67].
 The
 presence
 of
 a
 shoulder
 between
 low
 (∼210 ◦C)
 and
high
 (∼280 ◦C)
 temperature
 reduction
 peaks
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
the
 stepwise
 reduction
 of
 a
 fraction
 of
 Co3O4 to
 Co0.

taining

 ZrO2 mixed

 slightly
 lower
 position
 than
 that
 of
 TiO2-supported
 catalysts.
The
 broad
 feature
 observed
 for
 the
 TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
implies
 that
 virtually
 all
 CoOx species
 may
 have
 been
 embedded
in
 the
 support
 matrix
 making
 them
 difﬁcult
 to
 reduce
 at
 lower
temperatures
 [66,67].
Hydrogen
 uptakes
 of
 the
 various
 catalysts
 are
 summarized
 in
Table
 1.
 The
 ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 exhibited
 the
 highest
 total
H2-uptake
 (∼1025
 mol/gcat),
 followed
 by
 TiO2-,
 TiO2-ZrO2-,
 SiO2-
,
 SiO2-ZrO2-
 and
 SiO2-TiO2-supported
 catalysts.
 We
 can
 distinguish
between
 H2-uptake
 due
 to
 CoOx species
 reducible
 at
 lower
 temper-
ature
 (<500 ◦C),
 as
 it
 occurred
 with
 the
 ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 and
higher
 temperature
 (>500 ◦C),
 as
 observed
 with
 the
 SiO2-supported
one.
 Al2O3-
 and
 SiO2-Al2O3-supported
 catalysts
 showed
 no
 signif-
icant
 H2-uptakes,
 indicating
 that
 cobalt
 species
 were
 not
 reducible
up
 to
 840 ◦C.
 Lower
 H2-uptake
 by
 TiO2-
 and
 TiO2-ZrO2-supported
catalysts
 compared
 to
 the
 ZrO2-supported
 one
 indicates
 that
 CoOx-
admixing
 to
 TiO2 results
 in
 less
 reducible
 species
 (stronger
 support
interaction),
 e.g.
 CoTiO3 [57].
 Correlating
 this
 with
 the
 UV–vis
results
 (Fig.
 7)
 of
 the
 former
 two
 catalysts
 (TiO2-
 and
 TiO2-ZrO2),
the
 absence
 of
 the
 second
 signal
 of
 CoOx (around
 690

 can
 be
attributed
 to
 this
 Co–Ti
 interaction.

 over

 are
 close
 to
 those
reported
 for

 the
 presence
 of
 reducible

 which
 is
 in
 good

 with

(Fig.

 [68,69].
 However,
 a
 small
 difference
 in
 the
 BEs
 between
these

 exists
 (around
 0.4

pointing
 to
 the
 possible

 also
 the
formation
 of
 water,
 H2,
 CO,

 were
 detected
indicating

 occurrence
 of

Therefore,
 based
 on

 and
 with

the
 following
 reactions
 are
 proposed
 to
 be
 relevant.

all

 ethene
 was
 the
 major
 product
 conﬁrming
 ODHE
(C2H6 +
 CO2 →
 C2H4 +
 CO
 +
 H2O)
 and/or
 DHE
 (C2H6 →
 C2H4 +
 H2)
 as
the
 governing
 reactions.
 In
 the
 former
 case,
 CO2 has
 been
 reported
to
 oxidize
 the
 reduced
 active
 sites
 [8,29]
 (redox
 pathways)
 whereas
in
 the
 latter
 case,
 it
 pushes
 the
 equilibrium
 towards
 product
 side
by
 consuming
 H2 via
 reverse
 water
 gas
 shift
 (RWGS)
 reaction
(CO2 +
 H2 →
 CO
 +
 H2O)
 [12].
 The
 RWGS
 reaction
 has
 been
 investi-
gated
 separately
 over
 some
 selected
 catalysts
 (Fig.
 S2)
 and
 will
 be
discussed
 later.
 Production
 of
 CO
 from
 the
 reaction
 can
 be
 related
 to
RWGS,
 dry
 reforming
 of
 ethane
 (C2H6 +
 2CO2 →
 4CO
 +
 3H2)
 and/or
reverse
 Boudouard
 reaction
 (CO2 +
 C
 →
 2CO)
 but
 to
 separate
 con-
tributions
 of
 these
 feasible
 reactions
 is
 rather
 challenging.
 Coke
formation
 by
 cracking
 was
 observed
 with
 all
 catalysts
 but
 to
 dif-
ferent
 extent
 (Table
 S1).
 Methane
 production
 (Fig.
 S3)
 can
 be
related
 to
 CO
 and/or
 CO2 methanation
 or
 to
 ethane
 hydrogenoly-
sis
 (C2H6 +
 H2 →
 2CH4).
 The
 above
 mentioned
 reactions
 have
 been
observed
 in
 several
 studies
 [12,13,71].
 The
 elucidation
 of
 the
 indi-
vidual
 contributions
 of
 all
 side
 reactions
 is
 very
 demanding
 and
 was
beyond
 the
 scope
 of
 this
 work.

 Inﬂuence
 of
 single
 and
 mixed
 metal
 oxide
 supports
In
 a
 ﬁrst
 step
 the
 ODHE
 performance
 of
 all
 catalysts
 was
 com-
pared
 at
 standard
 conditions

 s/mL).
All
 catalysts
 showed
 an
 unsteady
 initial
 period
 (induction
period),
 the
 duration
 of
 which
 depended
 on
 the
 catalyst
 type.
Fig.
 10
 shows
 the
 conversion
 and
 selectivity
 to
 ethene
 of
 the
 cat-
alysts
 during
 the
 induction
 period
 (top
 ﬁgure)
 and
 at
 steady
 state
(bottom
 ﬁgure).
 During
 the
 induction
 period,
 all
 catalysts
 exhib-
ited
 relatively
 high
 ethane
 conversion
 and
 low
 ethene
 selectivity
compared
 to
 the
 performance
 after
 nearly
 steady
 state
 has
 been
achieved.
 This
 behavior
 is
 attributed
 to
 changes
 in
 the
 catalyst
 prop-
erties
 occurring
 during
 the
 induction
 period.
 All
 fresh
 single-
 and
mixed
 oxide-supported
 catalysts,
 except
 the
 ZrO2-supported
 one,
exhibited
 high
 surface
 acidity
 (Table
 1),
 as
 evidenced
 by
 high
 NH3
uptake.
 We  propose
 that
 the
 initial
 activity
 (induction
 period)
 of
the
 catalysts
 is
 inﬂuenced
 by
 the
 reducibility
 of
 the
 Co
 species,
 the
population
 and
 strength
 of
 the
 acidic
 sites
 and
 the
 SSA
 of
 the
 fresh
catalysts.
 Major
 changes
 during
 the
 induction
 period
 are
 induced
by
 coking
 and
 sintering
 of
 the
 catalysts.
 These
 changes
 are
 indicated
by
 the
 coke
 deposition
 (Table
 S1),
 particle
 size
 growth
 (Fig.
 3)
 and
decrease
 in
 SSA
 (Fig.
 2)
 of
 the
 catalysts
 after
 steady
 state
 has
 been
reached.
Coking
 is
 mainly
 promoted
 by
 the
 surface
 acidity
 (strength
 and
population
 density)
 of
 the
 different
 supports,
 while
 the
 decrease
 of
the
 surface
 area
 is
 thermally
 induced.
 The
 deposition
 of
 carbona-
ceous
 species
 on
 the
 surface
 seems
 to
 have
 a
 beneﬁcial
 effect
 on
the
 ethene
 selectivity
 but
 the
 activity
 decreases
 most
 likely
 due
 to
blocking
 of
 active
 sites.
 However,
 the
 contribution
 of
 the

 behav-

 of
 the
 catalysts
 cannot
 be
 differentiated
 unambiguously
 based
on
 the
 information
 collected
 in
 this
 work.
At
 steady
 state,
 SiO2-
 and
 ZrO2-supported
 cobalt
 catalysts
showed
 superior
 performance
 compared
 to
 those
 supported
 on
other
 single
 metal
 oxide
 supports.
 A
 similar
 ethene
 yield
 (around
23%)
 was
 observed
 for
 SiO2-
 and
 ZrO2-supported
 catalysts,
 with
 an
ethene
 selectivity
 of
 81%
 and
 62%,
 respectively.
 The
 activity
 of
 TiO2-
and
 Al2O3-supported
 catalysts
 was
 similar
 to
 that
 of
 the
 homoge-
neous
 gas
 phase
 reaction
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 catalyst
 (ethene
 yield
∼15%).
 Wang

 reported
 a

 for
 Cr-doped

 for
 ODHE
 where
 the
 performance
 of
 the
 SiO2-supported

 was
 superior
 compared
 to

 which
 is

Correlating
 CO2 conversions
 (Table
 S1)
 with
 the
 reaction
 results
(Fig.
 10),
 it
 can
 be
 inferred
 that
 conversion
 of
 CO2 is
 highly
 affected
by
 the
 support
 type,
 which
 will
 be
 discussed
 further
 in

Reaction

of
 the
 catalysts
 were
 evaluated
 to
 gain
 insight
 into
 the
 activity
 of
the
 catalysts
 (Fig.

 Interestingly,
 the
 SiO2-supported
 catalyst
showed
 the
 lowest
 rate
 (∼13
 mol
 C2H6/m2 s),
 while
 the
 ZrO2-
 and
TiO2-ZrO2-
 supported
 ones
 showed
 the
 highest
 rates
 (∼60

 Among
 all
 the
 catalysts,
 Al2O3-,
 ZrO2-

 TiO2-ZrO2-

 ones
 showed
 highest
 CH4 selectivity,
 while
 the
 lowest
was
 observed
 over
 the
 SiO2-supported
 one
 under
 the

dard

 (Table

 This
 indicates
 that
 cracking
or
 methanation
 is
 promoted
 over
 these
 three
 former
 catalysts.

Deeper
 insight
 into
 the
 catalyst
 performance
 is
 gained
 by
 con-
sidering
 the
 selectivity
 versus
 conversion
 plots.
 For
 that
 purpose
the
 catalysts
 were
 tested
 at
 different
 contact
 times
 (0.1–1.2
 g
 s/mL),
while
 keeping
 the
 other
 reaction
 conditions
 constant
 (Fig.
 11).
 At
isoconversion
 values
 >35%,
 the
 SiO2-supported
 catalyst
 showed
the
 highest
 ethene
 selectivity
 among
 all
 tested
 catalysts
 conﬁrm-
ing
 that
 it
 is
 the
 best
 performing
 catalyst
 for
 ODHE
 under
 these
conditions.
 This
 catalyst
 showed
 ethane
 conversion
 and
 ethene
selectivity
 as
 high
 as
 46%
 and
 74%,
 respectively.
 Similar
 high
 ethane
conversion
 (46%)
 was
 also
 observed
 over
 ZrO2-
 and
 TiO2-ZrO2-
supported
 catalysts
 but
 at
 the
 expense
 of
 ethene
 selectivity.
 The
undesired
 side
 reactions
 of
 ethene
 (e.g.
 formation
 of
 CH4 and
coke)
 became
 increasingly
 signiﬁcant
 at
 higher
 conversion/contact
time.
 The
 CH4 selectivity
 of
 SiO2-supported
 catalyst
 was
 virtually
constant
 at
 all
 contact
 times
 indicating
 the
 occurrence
 of
 ethene
conversion
 mainly
 to
 coke
 with
 increasing
 contact
 time
 (Fig.
 S3).
While
 over
 ZrO2-
 and
 TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 catalysts
 conversion
 of
ethene
 to
 CH4 seemed
 to
 be
 favored
 with
 increasing
 contact
 time
as
 evidenced
 by
 a
 small
 increment
 in
 its
 selectivity.
 The
 oppos-
ing
 trend
 in
 ethane
 conversion
 and
 ethene
 selectivity
 over
 these
catalysts
 indicates
 a
 trade-off
 between
 them
 that
 poses
 a
 critical
challenge
 for
 developing
 an
 efﬁcient
 catalyst.
At
 isoconversion
 values
 <35%,
 SiO2-
 and
 SiO2-ZrO2-supported
catalysts
 exhibited
 better
 performance
 than
 TiO2-,
 SiO2-Al2O3-
and
 SiO2-TiO2-supported
 ones.
 Though
 similar
 catalytic
 behav-
ior
 was
 observed
 over
 SiO2-
 and
 SiO2-ZrO2-supported
 catalysts,
improvement
 in
 ethane
 conversion
 with
 minimal
 change
 in
 ethene
selectivity
 could
 not
 be
 achieved
 over
 the
 latter
 even
 when
 using
the
 highest
 contact
 time
 (1.2
 g
 s/mL).
 Overall,
 the
 SiO2-supported
catalyst
 was
 the
 most
 efﬁcient
 catalyst
 exhibiting
 an
 ethene
 selec-
tivity
 of
 74%
 at
 46%
 ethane
 conversion,
 resulting
 in
 an
 ethene
 yield
of
 34%.
During
 ODHE,
 CO2 was
 consumed
 over
 all
 catalysts
 conﬁrm-
ing
 its
 active
 participation
 in
 this
 reaction
 (Table
 S1).
 Higher
 CO2
conversion
 was
 observed
 over
 ZrO2-
 (17%)
 and
 TiO2-ZrO2-
 (22.3%)
supported
 catalysts
 than
 over
 the
 others
 (3.4-9.5%).
 Oxidation
 of
 the
deposited
 coke
 from
 the
 catalyst
 surface,
 reaction
 with
 H2 favoring
the
 forward
 ethane
 dehydrogenation
 reaction
 [13]
 and
 oxidation
 of
reduced
 active
 species
 are
 some
 of
 the
 pathways
 [29]
 consuming
CO2.
 The
 high
 CO2 conversion
 over
 ZrO2-
 and
 TiO2-ZrO2-supported
catalysts
 can
 be
 directly
 correlated
 to
 the
 high
 ethane
 conversion
and
 low
 ethene
 selectivity
 (Fig.
 10),
 where
 CO2 assists
 in
 favoring
the
 forward
 dehydrogenation
 reaction
 by
 consuming
 H2 and
 also
 to
its
 beneﬁcial
 action
 in
 regenerating
 active
 sites
 blocked
 by
 carbona-
ceous
 deposits
 [13,29].
 The
 reverse
 water
 gas
 shift
 (RWGS)
 reaction
was
 performed
 independently
 over
 SiO2-,
 ZrO2-
 and
 TiO2-ZrO2-
supported
 catalysts
 to
 evaluate
 its
 role
 in
 the
 reaction
 network
(Fig.
 S2).
 High
 RWGS
 activity
 was
 observed
 over
 the
 ZrO2-
 and
TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 catalysts
 evidenced
 by
 high
 CO2 conversion.
Therefore,
 during
 the
 ODHE
 reaction
 over
 these
 two
 catalysts,
 high
ethane
 conversion
 can
 be
 directly
 related
 to
 the
 high
 RWGS
 reac-
tion
 rate,
 which
 shifts
 the
 equilibrium
 of
 the
 ODHE
 reaction
 towards
the
 products.
 Moreover,
 compared
 to
 the
 SiO2-supported
 catalyst,
these
 two
 catalysts
 exhibited
 slightly
 higher
 CH4 selectivity
 indi-
cating
 high
 cracking
 or
 methanation
 rates.
 Since
 ethene
 is
 more
reactive
 than
 ethane,
 the
 decrease
 in
 its
 selectivity
 is
 most
 likely
due
 to
 cracking.
 Additionally,
 the
 low
 ethene
 selectivity
 can
 also
arises
 from
 unselective
 reaction
 of
 ethane
 and
 CO2 (dry
 reform-
ing
 of
 ethane)
 [72].
 The
 CO2 conversion
 increased
 with
 increasing
contact
 time,
 mainly
 over
 SiO2-,
 ZrO2-
 and
 TiO2-ZrO2-supported
catalysts,
 further
 corroborating
 the
 CO2 participation
 in
 ODHE
 (Fig.
S5).
SiO2-,
 
ZrO2-,
 
and
 
TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 
catalysts
(Figs.
 10
 and
 11)
 may
 be
 taken
 to
 elucidate
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
the
 various
 characteristics
 (reducibility,
 Fig.
 8,
 Table
 1;
 surface
acidity,
 Fig.
 4,
 Table
 1;
 surface
 area,
 Fig.
 2)
 of
 the
 catalysts
 on
their
 activity
 and
 selectivity.
 We  speculate
 that
 depending
 on
the
 reducibility
 of
 the
 cobalt
 species
 and
 the
 surface
 acidity
 two
different
 reaction
 pathways
 may
 prevail,
 a
 redox
 and
 a
 non-redox
mechanism.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 SiO2-supported
 catalyst,
 cobalt
 sil-
icate
 was
 formed,
 in
 which
 the
 cobalt
 species
 are
 fairly
 stable
against
 reduction
 [64].
 It
 can
 be
 assumed
 that
 the
 tetrahedrally
coordinated
 Co2+ ions
 that
 are
 present
 in
 cobalt
 silicate
 [61]
are
 essential
 for
 the
 catalytic
 performance.
 Similar
 observation
was
 also
 reported
 for
 cobalt-exchanged
 hydroxyapatite
 [20]
 and
Co/MCM-41
 [25]
 catalysts
 during
 oxygen-assisted
 ODHE
 and
oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
 isobutane,
 respectively.
 Since
 the
bare
 ﬂame-made
 SiO2 is
 virtually
 inactive,
 showing
 a
 performance
similar
 to
 that
 of
 an
 empty
 tube
 (∼15%
 yield),
 it
 can
 be
 concluded
that
 the
 high
 activity
 of
 the
 SiO2-supported
 catalyst
 is
 exclusively
due
 to
 cobalt
 that
 exists
 predominantly
 as
 cobalt
 silicate
 con-
taining
 tetrahedrally
 coordinated
 Co2+ ions
 (Fig.
 7).
 In
 contrast,
octahedrally
 coordinated
 Co3+ ions
 (CoOx species)
 prevail
 in
 ZrO2-
and
 TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 catalysts,
 as
 corroborated
 by
 the
 low
temperature
 reduction
 proﬁles
 (Fig.
 8)
 and
 Co
 2p3/2,1/2 spectra
 of
XPS
 (Fig.
 9).
As
 concerns
 the
 role
 of
 surface
 acidity,
 SiO2-
 and
 TiO2-ZrO2-
supported
 catalysts
 showed
 similar
 overall
 NH3 uptake,
 whereas
that
 of
 the
 ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 was
 much
 lower
 (Table
 1).
The
 surface
 acidity
 was
 normalized
 by
 the
 catalysts’
 SSA
 and
 cor-
related
 to
 the
 activity
 of
 the
 catalyst
 to
 further
 understand
 the
activity-acidity
 relationship
 (Fig.
 S6).
 Regardless
 of
 the
 difference
in
 the
 surface
 density
 of
 acidic
 sites,
 all
 the
 catalysts
 showed
virtually
 similar
 ethane
 conversion
 except
 the
 SiO2-,
 ZrO2-
 and
TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 ones.
 Among
 these,
 the
 SiO2-supported
 cat-
alyst
 possessed
 the
 lowest
 density
 of
 acid
 sites
 followed
 by
 ZrO2-
and
 TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 ones
 (Table
 S1).
 An
 increase
 in
 ethane
conversion
 was
 observed
 with
 increasing
 surface
 density
 of
 acidic
sites,
 whereas
 an
 opposite
 trend
 was
 observed
 when
 relating
 them
to
 the
 ethene
 selectivity.
 This
 indicates
 that
 these
 sites
 are
 reactive
towards
 both
 ethane
 and
 ethene
 and
 indicates
 that
 beside
 the
 state
and
 reducibility
 of
 the
 cobalt
 species,
 surface
 acidity
 plays
 a
 role
in
 ODHE,
 particularly
 by
 promoting
 side
 reactions.
 Nevertheless,
regardless
 of
 these
 differences,
 the
 overall
 performance
 (ethene
yield)
 of
 these
 catalysts
 was
 virtually
 similar,
 lending
 further
 sup-
port
 that
 most
 likely
 different
 reaction
 pathways
 occur
 with
 these
catalysts.
As
 regards
 the
 role
 of
 the
 surface
 area,
 it
 seems
 to
 be
 of
 lesser
importance
 than
 reducibility
 and
 surface
 acidity.
 This
 emerges
 from

 m2/g)
 but
 their
 activity
 was
 low
 compared
to
 that
 of
 ZrO2 and
 TiO2-ZrO2.
With
 the
 SiO2-supported
 catalyst
 tetrahedrally
 coordinated
Co2+ ions
 in
 the
 SiO2 matrix
 and
 surface
 acidity
 seem
 crucial.
Recently,
 Hu
 et
 al.
 [73]
 showed
 that
 the
 selective
 propane
 dehydro-
genation
 proceeds
 via
 a
 non-redox
 mechanism
 over
 Co/SiO2 where
Co2+ ions
 are
 tetrahedrally
 coordinated
 in
 the
 SiO2 matrix.
 It
 was
speculated
 that
 the
 heterolytic
 cleavage
 of
 the
 ethane
 C
 H
 bond
 is
the
 key
 step
 in
 this
 reaction
 and
 the
 process
 is
 catalyzed
 by
 the
 non-
redox
 single
 site
 i.e.
 Co2+ that
 is
 tetrahedrally
 coordinated
 with
 the
SiO2 structure.
 This
 conclusion
 was
 derived
 based
 on
 the
 resistance
of
 these
 ions
 to
 both
 oxidation
 and
 reduction,
 in
 agreement
 with
previous
 reports
 on
 Co
 exchanged
 zeolite
 ZSM-5
 [74].
 In
 addition,
the
 residual
 Brønsted
 acid
 sites
 also
 signiﬁcantly
 contributed
 to
 the
activity
 of
 the
 zeolite
 catalyst
 [73,74].
 Thus,
 CO2 mainly
 reacts
 with
coke
 and/or
 H2 over
 the
 SiO2-supported
 catalyst.
 The
 reaction
 is
expected
 to
 occur
 primarily
 as
 a
 consequence
 of
 the
 redox
 cycle
of
 Co-O
 species
 over
 the
 ZrO2-
 and
 TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 catalysts,
wherein
 CO2 acts
 as
 an
 oxidant
 [29],
 in
 addition
 to
 its
 two
 previ-
ously
 mentioned
 contributions.
 An
 increase
 in
 ethane
 conversion
with
 a
 concomitant
 decrease
 in
 ethene
 selectivity
 was
 observed
that
 could
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 higher
 acidity
 of
 the
 TiO2-ZrO2-
supported
 catalyst.
Summarizing,
 
evidence
 
has
 
been
 
accumulated
 
that
 
both
reducibility
 of
 the
 cobalt
 species
 as
 well
 as
 the
 surface
 acidity
are
 important
 descriptors
 for
 optimizing
 supported
 cobalt
 cat-
alysts
 for
 CO2-assisted
 ODHE.
 The
 superior
 performance
 of
 the
SiO2-supported
 cobalt
 catalysts
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 role
 of
 the
relatively
 stable
 tetrahedrally
 coordinated
 Co2+ ions
 near
 the
 sur-
face,
 whereas
 the
 redox
 behavior
 of
 easier
 reducible
 CoOx species
seems
 to
 be
 crucial
 for
 explaining
 the
 performance
 of
 ZrO2-
 and
TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 catalysts.
The
 best
 performing
 catalysts
 were
 also
 evaluated
 for
 their
potential
 for
 the
 ODHE
 reaction
 using
 O2 as
 an
 oxidant
 (Table
S3).
 All
 the
 reaction
 conditions
 were
 kept
 similar
 as
 described
in
 the
 experimental
 section
 except
 the
 reaction
 temperature
 and
the
 reactant
 gas
 composition,
 which
 were
 changed
 to
 500 ◦C
 and
C2H6:O2:He
 =
 6.4:3.2:5.4
 mL/min,
 respectively.
 This
 temperature
was
 chosen
 since
 it
 seemed
 to
 represent
 the
 mean
 value
 of
 the
generally
 reported
 reaction
 temperatures
 (300–700 ◦C)
 and
 the
reactant
 gas
 ratio
 of
 2
 is
 equal
 to
 the
 stoichiometric
 ratio
 of
the
 reaction
 (C2H6 +
 0.5O2 →
 C2H4 +
 H2O)
 [1,7].
 Ethane
 conversion
and
 ethene
 selectivity
 were
 less
 than
 10%
 and
 40%,
 respectively,
over
 SiO2-
 and
 ZrO2-supported
 catalysts.
 However,
 these
 values
were
 higher
 over
 TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 catalysts
 (C2H4-yield
 of
∼16%).
 Former
 two
 supported
 catalysts
 promoted
 the
 unselective
reactions,
 whereas
 the
 latter
 one
 favored
 the
 desired
 reaction.
 Per-
formance
 of
 these
 catalysts
 was
 generally
 lower
 compared
 to
 most
other
 true
 ODHE
 catalysts
 [1,75,76].
 Nevertheless,
 the
 activity
 of
 the
mixed
 oxides
 supported
 catalyst
 seemed
 to
 be
 comparable
 to
 some
of
 the
 reported
 values
 exhibiting
 some
 potential
 as
 ODHE
 catalyst
under
 true
 oxidative
 conditions
 (with
 O2 or
 air)
 [20,22].
 Overall,
comparing
 the
 catalytic
 results
 from
 O2 and
 CO2 assisted
 ODHE,
 it
can
 be
 inferred
 that
 the
 use
 of
 the
 latter
 oxidant
 is
 beneﬁcial.

 at

For
 deeper

 (CO2/C2H6 =

 and

 as
 well
 as
 the
 cat-

 was

 Fig.
 12a
 shows
 the
 inﬂuence
of
 reaction
 temperature
 on
 the
 ODHE
 performance
 of
 the
 SiO2-

 catalyst.
 At
 higher
 reaction
 temperatures,
 in
 addition
to
 the
 catalytic
 reaction,
 some
 contribution
 of
 homogeneous
 gas
phase
 reactions
 seems
 to
 become
 signiﬁcant.
 An
 ethane
 conver-
sion
 of
 20%
 was
 achieved
 at
 650 ◦C,
 which
 increased
 with
 increasing
reaction
 temperature,
 attaining
 nearly
 50%
 at
 725 ◦C.
 However,
 at
T
 >675 ◦C,
 the
 ethane
 selectivity
 was
 adversely
 affected.
 At
 higher
reaction
 temperatures,
 formation
 of
 larger
 metallic
 cobalt
 ensem-
bles
 can
 be
 expected
 [26],
 which
 promotes
 the
 unselective
 and/or
secondary
 reactions
 resulting
 in
 lower
 ethene
 selectivity
 [72].
 Con-
comitant
 increase
 in
 CO2 conversion
 was
 observed
 with
 increasing
ethane
 conversion
 indicating
 that
 it
 assists
 the
 reaction
 by
 gasi-
fying
 the
 deposited
 coke
 and
 also
 by
 reacting
 with
 H2,
 which
 is
primarily
 produced
 by
 DHE
 [13].
 During
 this
 CO2 assisted
 coke
 gasi-
ﬁcation,
 the
 catalysts’
 surface
 is
 partially
 cleaned
 exposing
 sites
(e.g.
 cobalt
 metal
 ensembles)
 that
 transform
 ethene
 to
 coke,
 thus
lowering
 selectivity
 to
 ethene.
 In
 addition,
 CO2 reforming
 of
 ethane
could
 also
 contribute
 to
 high
 conversions
 (both
 ethane
 and
 CO2) at
higher
 temperatures
 [72].
Fig.
 12b
 shows
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 the
 feed
 gas
 composition
 on
 the
performance
 of
 the
 SiO2-supported
 catalyst.
 The
 reaction
 was
 car-
ried
 out
 with
 constant
 gas
 hourly
 space
 velocity
 of
 6,000
 L/kgcat h
 at
700 ◦C.
 The
 ethane
 conversion
 dropped
 from
 ∼30%
 to
 ∼20%
 when
CO2 was
 replaced
 by
 helium
 while
 maintaining
 the
 gas
 ratio
 of
 2.5,
in
 the
 reactant
 gas
 feed.
 However
 by
 lowering
 the
 reactant
 gas
 ratio
(CO2/C2H6)
 to
 1.5,
 ethane
 conversion
 increased
 to
 ∼34%,
 conﬁrming
that
 CO2 plays
 an
 important
 role
 during
 reaction,
 e.g.
 by
 removing
coke,
 as
 discussed
 earlier
 [13,17].
 After
 a
 slight
 decrease,
 ethene
selectivity
 increased
 and
 remained
 virtually
 constant
 (around
 80%),
irrespective
 of
 a
 further
 increase
 in
 the
 CO2/C2H6 ratio.
 A
 similar
trend
 was
 found
 for
 ethane
 conversion,
 which
 showed
 a
 small
 ini-
tial
 decrease
 followed
 by
 an
 increase
 to
 a
 stable
 value
 of
 ∼35%
resulting
 the
 highest
 ethene
 yield
 of
 ∼28%.
 Minimal
 decrease
 in
CO2 conversion
 was
 observed
 with
 increasing
 CO2/C2H6 ratio.
 This
behavior
 is
 similar
 to
 that
 observed
 by
 Zu
 et
 al.
 [72]
 for
 ODHE
over
 Co-loaded
 Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts.
 Rather
 high
 CO2 con-
versions
 (22–45%)
 were
 achieved
 at
 lower
 CO2/C2H6 ratio
 (≤3),
however,
 at
 the
 expense
 of
 ethene
 selectivity
 reducing
 their
 yield
 to
25%.
 This
 was
 attributed
 to
 CO2 reforming
 of
 C2H6 due
 to
 formation
and
 growth
 of
 metallic
 cobalt
 domains
 [72].
 So
 high
 catalyst
 activ-
ity
 can
 be
 achieved
 by
 maintaining
 the
 oxidic
 state
 of
 cobalt.
 Any
further
 improvement
 in
 the
 catalytic
 activity
 seems
 to
 be
 mainly
limited
 by
 the
 contact
 time
 (Fig.
 11).
The
 effect
 of
 gas
 hourly
 space
 velocity
 (GHSV)
 on
 the
 activity
of
 SiO2-supported
 catalyst
 at
 700 ◦C
 and
 a
 CO2/C2H6 ratio
 of
 2.5
is
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 12c.
 With
 increasing
 GHSVs,
 ethane
 conversion
decreased,
 whereas
 ethene
 selectivity
 increased
 to
 ∼24%
 and
 ∼86%,
respectively,
 at
 36,000
 L/kgcat h.
 This
 decrease
 in
 conversion
 can
 be
ascribed
 to
 the
 low
 residence
 time
 for
 reactant
 gases
 in
 the
 cata-
lyst
 bed.
 Improvement
 in
 the
 selectivity
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
reduction/elimination
 of
 secondary
 reaction
 pathways
 of
 ethene,
e.g.
 cracking
 [29,72].
 At
 higher
 GHSVs,
 ethene
 selectivity
 seemed
to
 have
 reached
 the
 optimal
 state
 though
 a
 decreasing
 trend
 in
 the
ethane
 conversion
 was
 still
 perceivable
 indicating
 similar
 product
distribution.
 The
 ethene
 yield
 followed
 a
 trend
 similar
 to
 ethane
conversion
 with
 increasing
 GHSV.
 The
 CO2 conversion
 increased
with
 decreasing
 GHSV
 corroborating
 its
 active
 role
 in
 the
 ODHE
reaction.
Sintering
 and
 coking
 are
 the
 two
 main
 reasons
 for
 deactiva-
tion
 of
 ODHE
 catalysts
 [11,13].
 Therefore,
 an
 investigation
 of
 the
stability
 of
 the
 catalyst
 is
 necessary
 to
 evaluate
 its
 efﬁcacy
 and
identify
 descriptors
 for
 tailoring
 the
 optimal
 catalyst.
 The
 time-
on-stream
 test
 was
 performed
 using
 the
 SiO2-supported
 catalyst
for
 5
 h
 under
 standard
 reaction
 conditions.
 The
 catalyst
 was
 stable
showing
 nearly
 30%
 ethane
 conversion
 and
 80%
 ethene
 selectivity,
exhibiting
 virtually
 constant
 ethene
 yield,
 even
 after
 5
 h
 of
 reac-
tion
 (Fig.
 12d).
 The
 initial
 unsteady
 period
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 early
changes
 in
 the
 physicochemical
 properties
 of
 the
 catalyst,
 e.g.
 SSA
decrease
 and
 coke
 deposition.

lowed
 the
 trend
 similar
 to
 that

 ethane

 indicates
 that
CO2 was
 actively
 involved
 in
 the
 reaction.
 XRD

 of
 the

 were
 similar

 that

 (Fig.

 the

 Conclusions
Among
 various
 single
 and
 mixed
 oxides,
 silica
 showed
 the
 best
performance
 as
 support
 for
 the
 Co-catalyzed
 oxidative
 dehydro-
genation
 of
 ethane
 with
 CO2.
 Depending
 on
 the
 support,
 different
types
 of
 interaction
 between
 CoOx and
 support
 were
 indicated
 by
H2-TPR,
 XPS
 and
 UV–vis
 spectroscopy.
 Well-reducible
 CoOx species
were
 formed
 in
 ZrO2-,
 TiO2-
 and
 TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 catalysts,
whereas
 the
 SiO2-containing
 catalysts
 showed
 very
 high
 reduction
temperature
 of
 the
 cobalt
 constituent
 due
 to
 formation
 of
 cobalt
 sil-
icate
 containing
 tetrahedrally
 coordinated
 Co2+ species.
 NH3-TPD
as
 well
 as
 DRIFTS
 showed
 that
 SiO2-
 and
 TiO2-ZrO2-supported
 cata-
lysts
 possessed
 moderately
 strong
 acidic
 sites,
 whereas
 SiO2-TiO2-
and
 SiO2-Al2O3-supported
 catalysts
 showed
 stronger
 acidic
 sites.
The
 studies
 revealed
 that
 both
 the
 reducibility
 of
 the
 Co
 species
as
 well
 as
 the
 strength
 and
 surface
 density
 of
 acidic
 sites
 are
 critical
catalyst
 properties
 for
 achieving
 optimal
 performance
 in
 the
 oxida-
tive
 dehydrogenation
 of
 ethane.
 However,
 these
 properties
 seem
 to
be
 interdependent
 to
 some
 degree,
 so
 that
 an
 absolute
 assignment
of
 their
 contribution
 cannot
 be
 given
 without
 ambiguity.
 Clear
 is
that
 the
 surface
 acidity
 also
 plays
 a
 signiﬁcant
 role
 by
 promoting
side
 reactions
 (e.g.
 reverse
 water
 gas
 shift
 and
 cracking).
Coke
 deposition
 was
 observed
 with
 all
 catalysts
 and
 Raman
spectroscopy
 revealed
 it
 to
 be
 mainly
 D-
 and
 G-type
 carbon.
 Para-
metric
 sensitivity
 studies
 of
 the
 best
 performing
 SiO2-supported
catalyst
 showed
 that
 high
 reaction
 temperature
 (>675 ◦C)
 is
 detri-
mental
 for
 ethene
 selectivity.
 Low
 performance
 in
 the
 absence
 of
CO2 conﬁrmed
 that
 CO2 plays
 an
 important
 role
 in
 ODHE
 increas-
ing
 the
 conversion
 by
 50%.
 Change
 of
 the
 oxidant
 from
 CO2 to
 O2
led
 to
 signiﬁcantly
 lower
 ethene
 yields,
 indicating
 that
 the
 use
 of
CO2 is
 beneﬁcial
 for
 these
 catalysts.
 The
 SiO2-supported
 catalyst
showed
 stable
 performance
 for
 5
 h
 time-on-stream.
 Optimization
of
 this
 catalyst
 by
 increasing
 the
 fraction
 of
 Co
 species,
 which
 are
embedded
 in
 the
 silica
 matrix
 and
 strongly
 interact
 with
 the
 sil-
ica
 support
 (cobalt
 silicate),
 seems
 a
 promising
 strategy
 to
 further
enhance
 the
 performance
 of
 this
 catalyst
 in
 ODHE
 with
 CO2.
