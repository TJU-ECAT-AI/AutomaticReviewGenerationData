Abstract
Utilization of CO2 as soft oxidant is emerging as a potential technology for industrial production of alkenes. Traditional way of alkene production in mass scale involves direct dehydrogenation of alkanes, which is energetically expensive. Oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is a greener alternate to the traditional normal dehydrogenation process. Hence, this area has drawn remarkable investment of research interest worldwide. From environmental point of view, utilization of CO2 is accepted as a means to mitigate the ever increasing greenhouse gas effect. CO2 utilization is also attractive for its abundant availability and cheaper cost. But utilization of CO2 suffers from the limitation of its inherent inertness. Application of suitable catalyst can help to overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic barrier of CO2 activation. Exploitation of the soft oxidant property of CO2 with the help of suitable catalyst in commercial scale can give a boost to polymer and fuel economy. Hence, it is interesting to focus on the possibilities of CO2 utilization in oxidative dehydrogenation process. The challenges met in this process and the invention of catalytic technologies to address those problems are summarized in this mini-review.
1. Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO2) has acquired the focus of global chemical research community due to its large scope of industrial utilization. The abundant availability, non-toxic nature, and mild oxidizing property have made CO2 chemistry more interesting. At present, industrial use of carbon dioxide can be found in production of chemicals, refrigeration systems, inert agent for food packaging, beverages, welding systems, fire extinguishers, water treatment processes, fertilizers, and many other smaller-scale applications. Large quantities of carbon dioxide are also used for enhanced oil recovery, particularly in the United States. Carbon dioxide can also become the raw material for producing carbon-based fuels. Biomass conversion to fuels also falls into the category of generating fuels from CO2.
While talking about CO2 chemistry, however, one can’t escape from mentioning its environmental contributions. Carbon dioxide (constitutes 0.04% of earth’s atmosphere) is an integral part of the ‘carbon cycle’ in which carbon flows in the form of energy and nutrient throughout the ecosystem and is exchanged between ocean, rock, soil, and biosphere, which is essential to maintain life on earth. CO2 is also important in maintaining Earth’s temperature through its natural greenhouse effect. However, this environmental boon has been regarded as one of the key culprits causing global warming. Excessive rise of atmospheric CO2 level in the industrial era has resulted in the phenomenon of global warming, which has become a serious concern worldwide. Along with checking the CO2 emission level, utilization of CO2 has also been globally envisioned by the scientific community as an obvious means to diminish atmospheric CO2 level. Active research groups are exploring new or improved CO2 utilization processes. Accordingly, extensive literature is also present which deal with CO2 uses in the industry

.
Invention of novel pathways for utilization of CO2 is well appreciated area in industrial as well as academic research. Application of CO2 as a feedstock for production of fuels, and other useful products like cement, polycarbonate plastics, etc has gained substantial research focus. Mineralization of CO2 and enhanced oil/gas recovery are some of the path breaking ways of controlling the ever rising CO2 level. CO2 has also found application in oxidation reactions as solvent in supercritical state and expanded solvent system. However, use of CO2 as a soft oxidant is another small but important research area. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant, an O-transfer agent, or an H-acceptor offers some interesting challenge to heterogeneous catalysis because of high thermodynamic stability and kinetically inertness of the CO2 molecule. Early studies on the use of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant have been reported for syngas production from methanol

. Oxidative dehydrogenation of the light alkanes has also been reported contemporarily
[8]
. Park et al. have deeply investigated different heterogeneous catalytic systems for utilization of CO2 as a soft-oxidant. Apart from soft oxidant, CO2 has also found application as a co-oxidant
[9]
. CO2 has also found application in the oxidation reactions as solvent in supercritical state and expanded solvent system. Park et al. have reviewed utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter in 2012
[21]
, providing an in depth analysis of the role of CO2 in soft oxidation process, factors responsible for activation of CO2, and earlier relevant literature reports. Hence, this perspective will mainly emphasize on the recent literature reports. Firstly, a brief summary of CO2 participation and activation will be reviewed followed by an in depth discussion of recent literature reports. Hopefully, this compendium will be helpful to further progress in this area in the right direction.
2. Participation of CO2 as soft oxidant in dehydrogenation reactions: advantages versus challenges
Against normal dehydrogenation reaction, oxidative pathway is favoured due to constant regeneration of the catalyst active sites by the oxidants. During catalytic dehydrogenation reaction in the absence of an oxidant, the lattice oxygen of the catalyst participates in H2 abstraction forming water. After the lattice oxygen of the catalyst surface gets exhausted, rate of formation of water decreases with a gradual increase in the formation of molecular H2, which in turn slows down the process
[10]
. Removal of H2 can overcome the equilibrium limitation and enhance catalytic performance
[11]
. However, in the presence of CO2 the dehydrogenation reaction pathway changes in oxidative manner, in which CO2 constantly maintains the supply of lattice oxygen and suppress the formation of molecular H2. The presence of CO2 induces reverse water–gas shift (CO2 + H2 ↔ CO + H2O), which in turn favours the ODH reaction
[12]

CO2 has several advantages as soft oxidant over various oxidizing agents tested for oxidative dehydrogenation like dry air, O2, CO2, N2O, and SO2
[13]
. Being milder than O2 and H2O, CO2 avoids the burning of valuable hydrocarbons
[14]
, and therefore can be efficiently utilized in a soft oxidation process
[15]
. It is less hazardous than N2O and SO2
[16]
. Apart from that, loss of latent heat does not take place, because CO2 stays gaseous throughout the reaction
[17]
. Heat capacity of CO2 is the highest among the typical gases
[18]
,
[19]
. CO2 increases the selectivity by poisoning the non-selective site of the catalyst, which are responsible for formation of by-products
[20]
. Furthermore, CO2 participates in the decoking process (C + CO2 → 2CO) that helps to sustain stable activity of the catalyst. Hence, the ODH reaction in the presence of CO2 can generally be coined as a gas-mediated modification of the catalyst surface, which cause favourable influence on adsorption, diffusion, and redox properties of the catalyst to carry out the dehydrogenation of alkanes
[21]
.
In spite of several advantages, utilization of CO2 in soft oxidation processes face difficulty due to inertness of CO2 molecule. The foremost challenging part of CO2 utilization is the activation of CO2 molecule. Gibbs energy of formation of CO2 (ΔG°298.15K = −394. 4 kJ mol−1) is considerably high. Kinetic barrier also plays a key role for its inertness. Interaction of CO2 molecule with a metal complex in homogeneous reaction or with a solid surface in heterogeneous reactions helps to overcome the kinetic barrier. In nature, CO2 fixation occurs through photosynthesis. The surface of the enzyme ribulose 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase gets involved in the process of CO2 activation. It is well-established that the active site of CO2 activation in photosynthesis is a Mg(II) ion embedded in a complex ligand field with oxygen atoms directly coordinated to the Mg centre. From the natural process of photosynthesis, it can be realised that sensible use of proper catalytic system can enhances the use of CO2 as a useful reactant.
3. CO2 activation
CO2 is a linear molecule with two equivalent CO bonds with bond distance 1.16 Å. CO2 has an ionization potential of 13.73 eV and an electron affinity of 3.8 eV, and is therefore considered a poor electron donor and good electron acceptor. Accepting an electron in its antibonding π orbital causes the molecule to bend, which is an essential step in the CO2 activation. Heterogeneous catalysis requires fixation of CO2 at the catalytically active sites. As shown in
Fig. 2
, CO2 may bind to a strong Lewis acid site on the catalyst surface via its lone pair on the oxygen site (a), or accepting electrons through its C atom or one of the CO bonds to form unidentate (b) or bidentate complexes (c). The latter complexes are activated CO2 species with the CO bond(s) being activated, and therefore, can be readily converted catalytically.

Fig. 2. Activation of CO2 on metal surface [-metal, -carbon, -oxygen].
It has been considered that the activation of CO2 on a surface can take place via electron transfer from a surface to the CO2 molecule which leads to the formation of CO2−, resulting in a bent anion in its equilibrium geometry. If the charge transfer moves in the opposite way, from the CO2 molecule to the surface, formation of a linear CO2 cation has to be considered which is energetically unfavourable. Therefore, it is sensible to consider the formation an energetically favoured bent anionic species. All other processes require energies that are orders of magnitude larger than those involving CO2. This aspect has been addressed at length in the earlier review by park et al.
[21]

Interaction of CO2 with metal and metal oxide surfaces have been thoroughly investigated by different research groups
[22]
,
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]
,
[26]
,
[27]

[28]
. The DFT study carried out by Pan et al. revealed the nature of the interaction of CO2 with dry and hydroxlated γ-Al2O3 supported metal dimer M2 (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) catalysts. Those 3d transition metal dimmers initiated the interaction of CO2 with γ-Al2O3 supported metal catalysts
[29]
. Adsorption of CO2 on M2/γ-Al2O3 led to partially activated CO2 in negatively charged bent configuration. Donation of electronic charges both from the metal dimer and support led to the activation of the adsorbed CO2. The metal dimer and the support interface act as the most suitable site for adsorption of CO2 on M2/γ-Al2O3, with either dry or partially hydroxylated support. The most favourable site for adsorption of CO2 is the interface between the metal dimer and the support. The electronic charges on the adsorbed CO2 distort it from its linear configuration. Both distortion energy and CO2 binding energy linearly depend on the amount of electronic charge on the adsorbed CO2. The 3d metals on the left of the periodic table exhibited a greater electron donating ability. Therefore, a stronger CO2 binding was observed for those metals. Manchado et al. demonstrated the existence of three energetically different species, including weakly adsorbed CO2, carbonate, and bicarbonate species over CO2 adsorbed metal surface from a series of volumetric and microcalorimetric measurements
[30]
. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) has been found to be one of the most active catalyst materials in catalytic CO2 conversion processes. There have been a number of studies on adsorption of CO2 on Ga2O3
[31]
,
[32]
,
[33]
. Collins et al. revealed the existence of carbonate and bicarbonate species on CO2 adsorbed Ga2O3 surface using in situ infrared spectroscopy broken in the adsorbed state
[33]
. Lavalley et al. also found that a higher degree of surface basicity and iconicity of α-Ga2O3 led to higher CO2 activation than γ-Ga2O3
[31]
.
4. Participation of catalyst in CO2 activation: favourable factors
4.1. Use of promoters
The fact that the reduction of CO2 to the radical anion CO2− represents an important mode of CO2 activation led the researchers to investigate the effect of alkali metals on CO2 activation
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
,
[37]
. The spontaneous reduction of CO2 to the radical anion, CO2−, and dianion, CO22−, were successfully accomplished using potassium or cesium as the activating metal. M+CO2− (where M = Na, K, Cs) was found to have a rhombic ring structure of C2v symmetry where the metal atom is interacting equally with the two oxygen atoms
[38]
. Use of alkali and alkaline earth metal ions has been reported in the literature
[39]
,
[40]
. The alkali metal impregnated catalysts showed good activity at optimum CO2/EB ratio. The ionization potential and ionic radius of the alkali metal controlled the CO2− valence bond angle and the activation of CO2
[37]
. It was suggested that, in carbon dioxide activation with alkali, the excess concentration of carbon dioxide led to the formation of oxalates
[41]
. Formation of formate was also reported in certain cases
[42]
. In addition to CO2 activation Park et al. demonstrated the role of alkali metal in decoking and stable activity in oxidative dehydrogenation reaction in CO2
[21]
. Farkas and Solymosi studied the activation of CO2 on K promoted gold (Au) (111) surface
[43]
. Potassium was adsorbed in cationic form on Au (111). CO2 adsorbed only weakly on clean Au (111). However, the presence of potassium greatly enhanced its binding energy and led to the formation of a CO2− radical anion and the unstable cluster compound (CO2)n·CO2−. The surface concentration and the reactivity of the CO2− radicals were found to delicately depend on the K coverage and on the state of potassium. Potassium (K), rubidium (Rb) or cisium (Cs) promoted iron-cerium (Fe–Ce) mixed oxide catalysts showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene
[44]
. Those alkali metal promoted catalysts were covered with double oxides, which were assumed to be the active species in the dehydrogenation reaction. Kinetic analysis revealed remarkable increase of the rate constant ‘k’, whereas the relative adsorption coefficient was unchaged. The strong base points were considered to be the active sites. Addition of Rb or Cs increased the number of basic sites on the catalyst surface, resulting in higher activity. The promotional role of alkali metals however point towards the obvious importance of acid–base properties of the catalysts in the utilisation of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant.
4.2. Surface acidity/basicity
The spectroscopic investigations along with the DFT studies on CO2 activation revealed that the CO2 activation on the catalyst surface involves electron donation from catalyst surface to the antibonding orbital of CO2. On the other hand, activation of the substrate for ODH involves electron donation from substrate to the acidic site of the catalyst surface. Moreover, basic sites carry out hydrogen abstraction from the substrate. Thus, cumulative effect of acidic and basic sites of the catalyst surface carries out the ODH reaction. Hence, an optimum combination of acidic and basic properties of the catalyst surface led to the best activity
[45]
. Sato at al. has proposed a plausible mechanistic pathway for dehydrogenation reaction, which proceed mainly by the oxidative pathway and partially by normal dehydrogenation pathway with co-operative interaction of acid and basic sites
[45]
. Two mechanistic pathways for the same in the presence and absence of CO2 have been suggested as shown in

Park and co-workers have demonstrated the role of surface acidity/basicity of the catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The acid and base properties of titania (TiO2), zirconia (ZrO2) and 50% TiO2–ZrO2 mixed oxide were investigated. The acid strength followed the order TiO2-ZrO2 > TiO2 > ZrO2
[46]
. On the other hand, CO2 TPD study showed that TiO2-ZrO2 exhibits highest number and strength of basic sites compared to the individual oxides. Superior activity of 60% TiO2–ZrO2 was observed in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, which was accredited to the occurrence of optimum acidity and basicity owing to the mixing of TiO2 and ZrO2
[47]
. Tetragonal zirconia had shown higher catalytic activity over monoclinic zirconia in oxidative dehydrogenation reaction
[46]
,
[48]
,
[49]
,
[50]
,
[51]
,
[52]
, which has been attributed to the balanced surface acidic/basic nature. Supported chromium based mesoporous catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity at the ODH of ethane (ODHE) with CO2
[53]
,
[54]
,
[55]
. The Cr redox cycle played an important role in the catalyst’s high activity. The physicochemical investigation of a series of Cr/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts with varied Cr contents from 2.5 wt.% to 10.0 wt.%, demonstrated that the percentage of loaded Cr2O3 had no influence on the structure of the support
[56]
below 5.0 wt.%. However, an interaction between the loaded Cr2O3 and the support affected the redox properties of the catalyst and resulted in a variation of basicity of the catalyst surface. Cr2O3 changed both the basicity and the amount of basic sites of the support. On one hand, the weak basic sites were strengthened and the strong basic sites were weakened. On the other hand, the number of both weak basic sites and the strong basic sites were enhanced. Michorczyk et al. demonstrated a direct relationship between the percentage of the Cr loading of the Crx/SBA-1 catalyst and ODH of propane activity
[57]
. The propane conversion rose sharply with the Crtotal content increasing up to 5 wt.%, beyond which the activity was partially diminished due to formation Cr2O3 crystals
[57]
.
A significant investigation on the influence of acid/base property on ODHEB with SnO2–ZrO2 nanocomposite catalysts with different compositions ranging from 0 to 100% of SnO2 by Park et al. and showed that the change in the acid–base bi-functionality of the nanocomposite catalysts in comparison with single oxides had profound positive influence in enhancing the catalytic activity
[58]
. In a recent study, Park et al. have demonstrated the importance of balanced surface acidity-basity on ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene over alkali metal (Na, K) doped TiO2-ZrO2 (TZ)
[52]
. The presence of K and Na in the structure enhanced the basic nature of the catalysts. All the doped catalysts exhibited higher basicity than the pure TiO2-ZrO2, which in turn enhanced the interactions of CO2 on the catalyst surface. However, the Na doped sample exhibit perfect balance acid/base property of the catalyst as shown in

The acid–base bi-functionality of the catalyst appeared due to the formation of TiZrO4 solid solution owing to the doping of alkali metals. Surface labile oxygen species were also enhanced due to doping. The TiZrO4 solid solution formation improved the stability of the catalyst, which reflected in the time-on-stream study as represented in

5. Influence of redox property and lattice oxygen of catalyst
The mechanism of ODH over the redox catalyst proceeds via a Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism, which is referred as a redox or regenerative mechanism
[59]
. Kinetic analysis and isotopic tracer studies were used to identify elementary steps and their reversibility in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over VOx/ZrO2 catalysts by Chen et al.
[60]
. The reaction kinetics was consistent with a Mars–van Krevelen redox sequence. Early studies on oxidative dehydrogenation reaction with γ-Al2O3 supported vanadium oxide catalyst suggest that bridging V-O-V are the active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reaction
[61]
. Though, in contrary Martınez-Huerta et al. have suggested that neither the V-O-V site nor the V = O are crucial for ODH, rather V-O-Al sites are active site for ODH reaction on V2O5/γ-Al2O3 catalyst
[62]
. Bars et al. have deeply investigated the reduction behavior of γ-Al2O3 supported vanadia catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction of ethane to ethylene
[63]
. Thermoprogrammed reduction study of the catalyst revealed that the vanadate species on the surface of V2O5/γ-Al2O3 are reduced by ethane and ethylene at lower temperatures. At the end of the reduction by hydrogen at 873 K, the particles of vanadium pentoxide were completely reduced to particles of vanadium trioxide in two steps as shown in

Fig. 6. Reduction of vanadate species (redrawn from Ref. [63]).
The surface/lattice oxygen plays the important role by abstracting hydrogen from the substrate resulting in formation of water and alkene with consequent reduction of the metal oxide to a lower valent state. This has been evidenced by Saito et al. by the transient response study of the dehydrogenation of EB under CO2 against Ar atmosphere with various supported catalysts
[64]
. The mass spectra obtained in the transient response study in Ar atmosphere suggested a steep increase in the H2O formation rate (overshoot) accompanied with styrene formation. This was attributed to the transfer of the lattice oxygen of vanadium oxide to ethylbenzene to give styrene and H2O. After exhibiting an overshoot of H2O formation, the water concentration decreased to background level and a gradual increase in H2 formation was observed with a similar rate of styrene formation (
Fig. 7
). This indicated that, after the consumption of lattice oxygen, the reaction proceeded via a simple dehydrogenation pathway, producing H2. On the other hand, the reaction under a CO2 flow showed the constant formation of H2O with no significant detection of H2, which indicated the continuous consumption of lattice oxygen in vanadium oxide and its consequential re-oxidation by CO2, producing H2O and CO. Therefore, the lattice oxygen of vanadium and iron oxides was transferred to EB in the dehydrogenation of EB under Ar at the beginning of the reaction. Under CO2, the transferred lattice oxygen was supplied partly from CO2 to keep vanadium or iron oxides at higher valence state oxides.

[64]
).
Direct evidence of oxygen exchange between the metal oxide and carbon dioxide in relation to the activity in the dehydrogenation of propane is reported in the literature
[65]
. Chen et al. carried out XRD studies of the fresh and used silica supported vanadia catalysts after EB dehydrogenation both in CO2 and N2
[66]
. The catalyst used under CO2 environment showed V2O5 diffraction lines, while the diffraction peaks corresponding to the lower valent oxide V2O3 dominated the XRD profile of the catalyst used under N2. The observation again indicated restoration of lattice oxygen and higher valent vanadium under CO2 atmosphere for EB dehydrogenation under CO2. Agrgyle et al. reported a decrease in the dehydrogenation rate with the addition of a small amount of H2O in the reaction medium in the ODH of ethane. This was attributed to the shift of equilibrium to reactant side due to the addition H2O
[67]
. However, Wang et al. have correlated the transmission capacity of oxygen with facile CO2 adsorption of the oxygen vacancies resulting in superior EB conversion
[68]
. The investigated Ce1-xFexO2(x ≤ 0.2) solid solutions prepared by a hydrothermal method had improved lattice structure of CeO2 and higher transmission capacity of oxygen. The formation of the Ce–Fe solid solution showed improved EB conversion, compared to the pure CeO2. However, Park et al. have also reported enhancement of labile ‘O’ in TiO2-ZrO2 by doping of Na and K
[52]
. Along with the fine tuning of the surface acid-basic properties, doping helped to enhance the labile oxygen and improved the catalytic performance
[52]
.
6. Use of supports
Supports improve the ODH catalytic activity by providing high surface area, porosity, and immobilization of the active catalyst phase. In ODH reaction the catalyst supports sustain the activity of the catalyst by maintaining highly dispersed active sites, which participate in the adsorption of the substrate and CO2. Support materials can also induce an acid or basic property to the active catalyst phase, which in turn influence the catalytic performance
[69]
. Hence, choice of support is a crucial factor in designing catalyst for ODH reaction in the presence of CO2. The environment of the catalytically active species controls the behavior of supported catalysts. The strength and reducibility of the bridging active species-O-support oxygen ions determine the catalytic activity
[70]
. Presence of synergism between active phase and support promote the catalytic performance
[71]
. Acidic/basic sites of the support materials determine the selectivity for oxydehydrogenated products depending on the alkane fed
[72]
. Higher surface area of support material leads to higher dispersion of the active phase, which facilitates the ODH process. Moreover, presence of surface adsorbed O atoms play the key role in controlling the activity
[64]
. Mentasty et al. reported that the texture of alumina support had influenced the catalytic behavior in the dehydrogenation of propane
[73]
. Takahara et al. investigated the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 over Cr2O3/Al2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, and Cr2O3/C catalysts and reported that CO2 exhibited a promoting effect on Cr2O3/SiO2
[74]
. It was proposed that CO2 would exert an adverse effect on activity for strong basic catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane
[75]
,
[76]
. The effect of different supports (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) on the structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were examined by Khodakov et al.
[77]
. ZrO2-supported catalysts showed the highest oxidative dehydrogenation rates and SiO2-supported catalysts the lowest activity, while the other supports exhibited intermediate reactions rates (TiO2 > HfO2 > Al2O3). The structure and dispersion of VOx species was found to be dependent on their surface density and their interaction with a given support. Support surfaces predominantly covered with polyvanadate structures or small V2O5 clusters containing V-O-V or V = O linkages led to higher oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivity. The extent of dispersion and the local and extended structure of supported VOx species were found to be influenced by the chemical identity and the surface area of the support
[70]
,
[78]
. Previous studies had shown that basic metal oxides (e.g., MgO, Bi2O3, La2O3, Sm2O3) supported vanadia catalysts led to higher alkene selectivity compared to that with acidic oxide supports
[70]
,
[79]
,
[80]
. Several authors have also proposed that acidic V2O5 species interact weakly with acidic supports, leading to poorly dispersed V2O5 crystallites.
7. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
Styrene, one of the most important monomer used in polymer industry, is mostly produced by direct the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in presence of excess steam over an iron oxide catalyst in an adiabatic reactor
[81]
. This process is limited by thermodynamic limitations, low conversion rate, high endothermic energy (ΔH°298 = 123.6 kJ mol−1), high energy consumption, and deactivation of the catalyst by coke formation
[82]
. Oxidative dehydrogenation reaction using O2 is a possible alternate way, but is associated with drawback of burning a significant amount of valuable hydrocarbon. However, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the presence of CO2 can emerge as an efficient alternative technology

. Zhang et al. have represented direct in situ spectroscopic evidence of coke deposition and deactivation of high surface area ceria catalyst in the absence of CO2. Two-step mechanistic pathway involving ethylbenzene is dehydrogenated to styrene and H2 in the first step and removal of H2 via reverse water-gas shift reaction in the presence of CO2 was also evidenced
[83]
. Kovacevic et al. have investigated the effect of morphology of CeO2 catalyst in the presence and absence of CO2
[84]
. Ceria cubes, with specifically exposed (100) crystal planes of low intrinsic stability provided more oxygen resulting in remarkably higher activity over ceria rods and particle. Presence of CO2 initially led to over oxidation due to presence of excess oxygen species triggering the formation of a by-product before reaching stable activity. Periyasamy et al.
[106]
have reported low yield of styrene in presence of CO2 with fluorite structured CeZrO4–δ. However, Park et al. have demonstrated SBA-15 as a promising support for ceria-zirconia (25:75) mixed oxide catalyst for ODHEB in using CO2. Highly dispersed CeO2
[85]
and Ce-Mn mixed oxide
[86]
nanoparticles encapsulated inside carbon nano tubes (CNT)s have been investigated for the ODH reaction of EB using CO2 as a mild oxidant. High dispersion and confinement effect of CNT is assumed to lead to high efficiency of those CNT confined catalysts. Compared to CeO2 outside CNTs, the confinement effect of CNT channels strengthened the interaction between CeO2 particles and CNT inner walls, which in turn, induced the distortion of CeO2 crystal lattice. This promoted reduction of CeO2 and activation of its surface lattice oxygen. In the case of Mn doped catalyst, Mn promoted CO2 decomposition, surface oxygen vacancy, active oxygen, active hydrogen and the coupling between the redox couples of Mn4+/Mn3+ and Ce4+/Ce3+ leading to higher yield of styrene. Metal free hydroxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes have also shown to exhibit good activity in ODHEB
[87]

Vanadium containing catalysts have been exploited in CO2 assisted ODHEB reaction

. A fast catalyst deactivation is often encountered on most of the catalyst systems in the dehydrogenation of EB to styrene. The probable reason behind this fact is that the ODHEB favourably occurs on the vanadyl oxygen O(1) site of the V2O5 (001) surface. With the formation of styrene and H2O molecules O vacancies are created on the V2O5 (001) surface. The CO2 being a soft oxidant can hardly regenerate the active sites on V2O5 (001) surface in time due to the high activation energy (3.16 eV)
[89]
. The missing active sites gradually lead to the deactivation of the V2O5 catalysts. However, Reddy et al. have shown that ceria doped vanadia catalyst supported on titania-zirconia mixed oxide has reasonable stability in time-on-stream study
[90]
. Liu et al. have demonstrated

Park et al. have demonstrated that modified vanadium oxide catalysts to be very active, selective and relatively stable catalysts for ODHEB in presence of CO2
[14]
,
[92]
. Effective regeneration of active sites on silica supported vanadia catalyst with CO2 has also been reported
[66]
. Ten percent La2O3–15%V2O5/SBA-15 (wt.%) catalyst is reported to show 74% styrene yield where La3+ effectively hindered coke deposition
[93]
. Use of AlMCM-41 materials as support also gives promising result for vanadium-supported catalysts in the ODHEB in the presence of CO2
[94]
.
ZrO2 based mixed oxide catalysts with TiO2, MnO2, CeO2, etc have shown good activity in the ODHEB in presence of CO2. MnO2–ZrO2 binary metal oxide catalyst exhibited high yield of styrene at elevated temperature. In the absence of CO2, poor catalytic activity and stabilities were observed. A gradual increase of activity was found with enhanced CO2/EB ratios
[95]
. TiO2‐ZrO2 combined catalyst has been demonstrated as active catalyst as well as support in ODHEB

[97]

[98]
. Ratio of TiO2/ZrO2 had influence on the activity. A 60% titania loading was optimum for ODHEB reaction

.
Commercially available Fe-based catalysts are well-known to be ineffective for ODHEB in CO2 owing to the decomposition of active catalytic phase
[99]
. However, introduction of suitable dopant and use of support can improve the activity by facilitating reoxidation of Fe2+ and suppressing coke deposition

8. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane
Ethylene is an important raw material in the modern chemical industry, which is currently produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Thermodynamic limitation, rapid coking, and high energy consumption are the major drawbacks of the traditional processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) in the presence of soft oxidant like CO2 is a promising alternative from industrial as well as environmental standpoint. Cr promoted catalysts prevail the literature for ODHE in presence of CO2. Use of zeolite supports for Cr-oxide catalyst has shown promising results. In recent time, Rahamani et al. have reported a novel Cr-based catalyst using chemically treated natural zeolite clinoptile support, which imposes favourable acidity in the catalyst
[108]
. Uniform, tuneable smaller particles with higher dispersion of chromium species could be achieved using modified clinoptilolite supports. Cr/clinoptile catalyst was claimed to be superior in terms of cost effectiveness and sustainability. H-ZSM-5 supported Cr-catalyst Cr/H-ZSM-5 1900 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 1900) and Cr/H-ZSM-5 190 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 190) has been shown to perform better than SiO2 supported catalyst
[54]
. SiO2/Al2O3 ratio affected the nature of the Cr active species and the activity of the catalyst. Adverse effects of higher alumina content in the zeolite were found on the catalyst activity, which was again attributed to the interference caused to incorporation of the Cr into the zeolite framework and the Cr redox chemistry. However, replacement of Cr2O3 with V- and Ga-oxide for the active phase on H-ZSM-5 support led to lower activity. Mimura et al. proposed the catalytic redox cycle for the zeolite supported catalyst in which C2H6 was assumed to be absorbed on the acidic site of H-ZSM and CrOx
[108]
. The activated C2H6 was converted to C2H4 by the O from CrOx. Side reactions also took place leading to formation of methane and coke via hydrocracking, along with simple dehydrogenation. CO2 effectively reoxidized CrOx-1 species, which lost the active O, and removed coke from the catalyst surface. Liu et al. have investigated the catalytic performance of chromium-based mesoporous molecular sieves, including Cr incorporated MSU-1 (Cr-MSU-1) and Cr supported MSU-1 (Cr/MSU-1)
[109]
. Considerable activity was reported involving Cr6+/Cr3+redox cycle.
Shi et al. used Cr catalyst promoted by oxygen storage material CeO2, using mesoporous silica support SBA-15 with tunable uniform hexagonal channels with average pore size ranging from 5 to 30 nm and thick pore walls in the range of 3.1–6.4 nm
[53]
. Larger pore diameters and the stronger interaction between the active species and the support led to enhancement of catalytic activity. Addition of Ce species into the 5Cr/SBA-15 catalyst changed both the number and nature of active sites. Reducibility of chromium and the ratio of Cr6+/Cr3+ in the catalysts were increased. The presence of Ce species might have caused higher catalytic activity of the 5Cr–Ce/SBA-15 catalysts for the ODH of ethane with CO2. Moreover, CeO2 increased the stability of 5Cr/SBA-15 due to their high thermal stability and better dispersion of the active metal.
Fe-promoted Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts are also reported in the literature to exhibit high catalytic activity
[110]
,
[111]
. Cr6+/Cr3+ redox cycle actively involved in ODH whereas, Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycle helped in removing H2 by the lattice oxygen. Shi et al. further modified the SBA-15 supported Cr catalyst by using FeCrAl alloy
[112]
. FeCrAl alloy is suitable for the preparation of monolithic catalysts because heat treatment in air at temperatures above 1173 K results in the formation of a thin layer of α-alumina, which facilitates the deposition of other oxide phases on the surface. The 5% Cr loaded Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl monolithic catalyst was optimum for high C2H6 conversion and C2H4 yield. Higher Cr loading led to a formation cluster of lower valent Cr(III) instead of well dispersed active phase
[113]
.
Wang et al. demonstrated the significant role of acidity/basicity of the oxide support, the interaction between the support and active catalyst, and the amount of chromium loading
[69]
. The investigation was carried out with unsupported as well as different oxide supported chromium catalysts
[69]
. Among SiO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 supported and unsupported Cr catalysts the order of activity was found to be Cr/SiO2 > Cr/Al2O3 > Cr2O3 > Cr/TiO2. Stronger basicity of Al2O3 resulted in lower activity of Cr/Al2O3 compared to Cr/SiO2. Moreover, chromium oxide interacts more strongly with aluminum oxide than with silica, forming tetrahedral Cr6+ species leading to decreased activity
[114]
. TiO2 supported catalyst exhibited even lower activity than unsupported Cr2O3 due to strong interaction between the support and active catalyst. All the active catalysts exhibit two Cr species, Cr3+ and Cr6+ on the catalysts surface. A profound influence of the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio was found on the reducibility of the respective catalysts. Hence, the mechanistic pathway of the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane was assumed to involve the Cr6+/Cr+3 redox cycle. The reduced Cr oxide species were restored by oxidation with CO2. Simultaneous removal of coke continued via oxidation by CO2. However, oxidation state of the active species is controversial. Mimura et al. mentioned the key role of either of the two species Cr6+=O and Cr5+=O behind the high activity of Cr catalysts in ODH of ethane
[55]
.
However, success of ODH reaction with Cr-based catalyst is also dependent on the reaction temperature. In fact, a Cr redox cycle can be observed at (773–823 K), which is lower than the temperature of ethane dehydrogenation at 923 K. The conversion of C2H6 and CO2 increased with rising temperature. At higher reaction temperature selectivity of ethylene decreased a little bit, whereas selectivity of methane increased. This has been attributed to the fact that with rising temperature the secondary reaction like hydrocracking of ethane was favoured. Dogu et al. tested the low temperature ODH activity of Cr–O catalyst with that of Cr–V–O catalyst below 673 K. Ethylene selectivity of both the catalysts were equally high in the low temperature range, whereas conversion with Cr–V–O was very low compared to Cr–O, which has been attributed to the easier reducibility of Cr-O than Cr-V-O at temperatures lower than 673 K
[115]
.
Other than Cr catalysts a few more catalytic systems have been reported in the literature for ODHE. Among which Ni–Nb–O catalyst is known to exhibit very good activity at relatively lower temperature
[116]
,
[117]
,
[118]
. Interestingly, Heracleous et al. investigated the factors responsible for higher catalytic activity of this system. The improved activity was attributed to the formation of Ni–Nb solid solution due to reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic defects of NiO and the insertion of Nb in the NiO lattice. The interaction between Nb and cationic oxygen vacancies of NiO generated two phases. (i) A Ni-rich crystallized phase with Nb cations incorporated in the NiO lattice, which retained its original crystallographic structure. (ii) A highly distorted Nb-rich phase, which acted as the precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound. The author demonstrated that the reaction of Nb with the cationic vacancies led to the rupture of larger crystals into smaller ones, which resulted in increased surface area and the per weight activity of ODHE reaction.
Alkaline earth metal Ca doped ThO2 was shown to exhibit good catalytic activity. Presence of surface-bound radical oxygen species led to radical mechanism resulting in higher activity
[119]
. Ni-La/SiO2 catalyst was developed and tested for ODH in the presence of CO2. The ethylene yield was not impressive
[120]
. However, the study showed that introduction of methane in the reaction increased the ethylene selectivity over Ni-La/SiO2 catalyst. Flame sprayed TiO2 supported Ga catalyst has been investigated for ODHE in presence of CO2
[121]
. Interestingly, the study showed that the ethelyne yield increases up to 10% Ga loading, which was attributed to strong decrease in the population of acidic sites. Increase of Ga loading beyond this percentage had little effect on the acidic site population but the strongest acidic sites became prominent leading to deactivation of the catalyst due to coking effect. Zhu et al. introduced Co-promoted Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalyst for production of ethylene/syngas in the desired molar ratio (C2H4/H2/CO = 1/1/1) for hydroformylation
[122]
. Very recently, Myint et al. have introduced FeNi/CeO2 bimetallic catalyst which showed considerable activity and stability for ODH of ethane
[123]
. Some of the ODHE catalysts are presented in

9. ODH of other light alkanes like propane & butane in presence of CO2
Yan et al. systematically investigated Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts for ODH of 1-butene using CO2
[127]
. Fe2O3 improved oxygen mobility and tuned the surface acidity of γ-Al2O3, which effectively enhanced both 1-butene conversion and BD selectivity. A 20 wt.% Fe2O3/Al2O3 was optimum for best activity. Increase of the reaction temperature from 573 to 873 K resulted in an enhancement of both1-butene conversion and BD selectivity. But increase of undesired products (C1–C3 and coke) also took place. Chromium based catalyst Cr-MCM-41, in which chromium species was introduced into MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis or the template ion exchange method. The catalysts exhibited appreciable conversion and selectivity in dehydrogenation of propene
[128]
,
[129]
. Other supported Cr catalysts like Cr/H[B]MFI are also reported for ODH of light alkanes in the literature
[72]
,
[130]
.
Different supported vanadium oxide catalysts have been reported for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes in the literature. Raju et al. demonstrated high activity and good time-on-stream stability of ceria-zirconia supported vanadium oxide catalyst in the dehydrogenation of n-butane
[131]
. Formation of CexZr1-xO2 solid solution and a highly dispersed vanadium oxide over the CZ support facilitated the process. Isolated tetrahedral V5+ species and dymeric and/or polymeric tetrahedral V5+ species were reported as the active and selective sites in the ODH of alkanes
[70]
,
[132]
,
[133]
. The catalytic performance was controlled by factors like (i) distance between selective sites, (ii) length of the alkane fed, and (iii) the acid-base character of catalysts. The appearance of octahedral V5+ species (both isolated or polymeric species) favored the incorporation of oxygen atoms into the olefinic intermediate. The possible mechanistic pathway for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by silica supported vanadium oxide catalysts were examined by density functional theory
[134]
. Two subsequent reaction steps have been considered. In the first rate determining step, abstraction of hydrogen from propane by a vanadyl (V = O) group was assumed yielding a propyl radical bound to a HOVIV surface site. The second step consisted of a second hydrogen abstraction at the same or different vanadia site leading to formation of propene. Hydrogen abstraction at the same site yielded H2O·VIII, whereas the second hydrogen abstraction at a fresh, “unreacted” site, resulted in the formation of two HOVIV species. However, VV/VIV redox cycles were energetically preferred over VV/VIII cycles. Moreover, the activity was correlated to the particle size. Energy barriers for the ODH reaction with silica supported vanadia catalyst increased with increasing vanadia cluster size when passing from monomers to dimers to larger oligomers.
10. Scope in industry
Dehydrogenation of aromatic olefins represents one of the most useful technologies for producing essential monomers for the polymer industry. Ethylbenzene dehydrogenation for styrene production is the most widely used dehydrogenation process at present, which is used for the production of synthetic rubbers, ABS resins, polystyrenes, and so on. Direct dehydrogenation is one of the popular ways of synthesizing styrene. In this process excess superheated steam near 1073 K is combined with ethylbenzene in a low-pressure adiabatic reactor containing potassium promoted iron oxide catalyst. The reaction temperature is around 873–923 K and the reaction pressure is typically about 40–80 kpa. The steam plays the role of diluent, which lowers the partial pressure of the hydrogen byproduct generated during the dehydrogenation reaction. This allows the reaction to proceed to a greater extent. The steam also provides the heat to meet the energy requirement for the highly endothermic process. It often inhibits coke formation on the reactive catalyst by steam gasification. However, the process becomes energetically expensive due to the use of excess superheated steam. It also has the disadvantages of catalyst deactivation and limited conversion.
Another technology, the Lummus/UOP Smart Process addresses some of the problems of direct dehydrogenation process. It applies selective oxidation of a portion of the hydrogen formed as byproduct in the dehydrogenation reaction. The energy produced from the exothermic oxidation reaction of the hydrogen with oxygen, partially meets the heat energy required for subsequent EB dehydrogenation. The removal of hydrogen also facilitates the process by shifting the reaction equilibrium, which considerably increases EB conversion with high styrene monomer selectivity. However, this process also has limitation in terms of necessity of two catalysts in the reactor, one for catalyzing the dehydrogenation reaction and other for the oxidation of the hydrogen by oxygen. Moreover, the process comprises a complicated reactor design and the catalyst loading system. The reaction condition applied adversely affects the potassium promoted iron oxide catalyst used for. Safety concerns are also associated with the process due to the use of oxygen.
Schwint et al. have proposed a modified technology for the whole process, in which two parallel reactions occur simultaneously
[135]
. In one reaction, oxidative dehydrogenation of EB with carbon dioxide takes place resulting in formation of a styrene monomer with water and carbon monoxide as byproducts. The other reaction carries out EB dehydrogenation to styrene monomer over a catalyst. The byproducts H2 and CO are selectively oxidized to steam and CO2 over a catalyst with the generation of heat, which is reutilized in the process
[135]
.
Park et al. have invented an efficient novel process for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to produce styrene using carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant
[136]
. The process runs by the direct utilization of CO2, which may be obtained as a byproduct from petrochemical oxidation or the reforming industry. The process works at relatively lower temperature, around 833 K using zeolite-supported iron oxide or titania-zirconia based mixed oxide catalyst
[21]
,
[82]
. The process is highly selective for styrene formation. The details of the process and the advantages are discussed at length in the earlier reviews
[21]
. A schematic diagram of the proposed process is presented in

At present, only a few processes based on CO2 as a soft oxidant have been materialized on a technical scale. The present challenges for the industrial applications of this technology involve process feasibility studies, designing a suitable reactor to reduce energy consumption, and development of appropriate catalysts with high conversion efficiency. Dedicated research in this field is welcome for further development of this emerging technology. This review is aimed to outline the emergence, application and understanding of such systems and to shed light on the further development that may lead to industrial scale operations in the near future.
