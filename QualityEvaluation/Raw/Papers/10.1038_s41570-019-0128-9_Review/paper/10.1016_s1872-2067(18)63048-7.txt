The nV‐MCM‐41 catalysts were prepared by one‐step hydrothermal synthesis and applied to the 
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) in the presence of CO2. Several state‐of‐the‐art char‐
acterization methods were performed to explore the correlation between catalytic performance and 
the physicochemical characterizations of the catalysts. Because moderate amounts of V species 
were introduced into the framework of MCM‐41, the catalyst maintained a large specific surface 
area, a highly ordered mesoporous structure, and highly dispersed V active sites (monomeric and 
dimeric V oxide species), while the high‐vanadium‐doping catalysts caused an enhancement in the 
number of acidic sites and V2O5 crystallites. The ODHP reaction showed that the 6.8V‐MCM‐41 (V 
content 6.8 wt%) catalyst exhibits high activity and stability, and the C3H8/CO2 molar ratio (1:4) was 
suitable. The promoting effect of CO2 on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ODHP was demonstrated 
as the reaction coupling mechanism and “lattice oxygen” mechanism.

1.  Introduction 
Propene is an important petroleum chemical raw material, 
used mainly in the production of substances such as polypro‐
pene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, butanol, octanol, and propene 
oxide. In recent years, the demand for propene has increased 
markedly because polypropene has become one of the most 
important general‐purpose plastics. Propene is generally 
co‐produced with ethylene by the steam cracking of naptha and 
with gasoline by the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) of gaso‐
line. These processes are carried out at high temperatures with 
low propene selectivity and inevitable coke formation [1,2]. 
Therefore, it is urgent to find a new technology with less energy 
intensive processes for propene production [3–5]. 
Many studies dealing with the oxidative dehydrogenation 
(ODH) of light alkanes have been recently reported, with oxi‐
dants such as O2, N2O, and CO2. Kondratenko et al. [6,7] report‐
ed that VOx/γ‐Al2O3 and VOx/MCM‐41 showed high propene 
selectivity in ODH of propane (ODHP) with N2O as an oxidant. 
However, industrialization would be hindered by the deep oxi‐
dation of propane and products or by the high cost of N2O [8,9]. 
CO2 acting as a single mild oxidant, which can effectively in‐
hibit deep oxidation and improve the stability of the catalyst, 
has been widely used in propane dehydrogenation by many 
researchers. Moreover, the dehydrogenation reaction coupled 
with the reverse water‐gas shift reaction is an attractive ap‐
proach to improve the equilibrium conversion in the ODHP 
process [10]. Previous work indicated that CO2 was advanta‐
geous for maintenance of the metal active sites in a high oxida‐
tion state for an NiMoO4 catalyst [11]. Nakagawa et al. [12] and

Fukudome et al. [13] reported that the use of CO2 as an oxidant 
markedly promoted the dehydrogenation of propane over the 
oxidized diamond‐supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts  and 
over the lattice oxygen of V oxide. 
Ordered mesoporous materials are widely employed in the 
ﬁelds of catalysis, adsorption, and biochemistry. The high sur‐
face area of ordered mesoporous materials allows the poten‐
tially efﬁcient dispersion of active sites, and the uniform pore 
size in the mesoporous range favors the diffusion of bulky 
molecules. Among them, MCM‐41 has been widely used since it 
was first reported in 1992 by Mobil Oil Corp. [14,15]. However, 
MCM‐41 in its pure siliceous form shows limited applications in 
catalytic organic transformations due to a lack of active sites 
[16,17]. Hence, modiﬁcation is necessary, which is achieved by 
incorporating active components into the MCM‐41 framework. 
Many metals have been incorporated into the MCM‐41 frame‐
work. V has been verified as the active and selective active cen‐
ter in ODHP [18–20]. Shylesh et al. [18] reported that V‐based 
catalysts displayed excellent activity toward the epoxidation 
reaction of bulkier oleﬁns. The V‐MCM‐41 samples also showed 
good catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of sty‐
rene using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant [16]. 
Metal‐modified mesoporous silica can be synthesized by ei‐
ther a one‐step co‐condensation method or post‐synthesis 
treatment. With the one‐step method, the active species can be 
directly incorporated into the pore channels and are better 
dispersed compared with the impregnation method, contrib‐
uting to higher catalytic performance. 
The reaction mechanism of ODHP by V oxide catalysts sup‐
ported on silica was examined by density‐functional theory 
(DFT) [19,21]. The active sites are the highly dispersed VOx 
species, which can be classified as monomeric and 
two‐dimensional oligomeric V oxide species below the mono‐
layer coverage [22–24]. The reaction involved two‐hydrogen 
abstraction [19]. Single‐crystal V2O5 (001) was not a good cata‐
lyst because the terminal O was too active to release the pro‐
pene [20], and the bulk V2O5 crystallites of three‐dimensional 
particles exhibited low catalytic activity. Therefore, it is ex‐
pected that V oxide species can be tuned by controlling the 
extent of their polymerization. 
The aim of this work is to synthesize and characterize 
nV‐MCM‐41 mesoporous molecular sieves and investigate the 
effects of different V amounts in ODHP in the presence of CO2. 
The nV‐MCM‐41 catalysts were prepared by a one‐step hydro‐
thermal synthesis. The framework structure, texture, thermal 
stability, and hydrothermal stability of nV‐MCM‐41 materials 
were investigated. The selective oxidation of propane was 
conducted to investigate the potential catalytic applications of 
the nV‐MCM‐41 sample, and it showed good stability. 
2.  Experimental 
2.1.  Catalyst preparation 
The catalyst was synthesized by a one‐step hydrothermal 
method using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica 
source and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as the 
template. The synthesis steps are as follows. In a typical pro‐
cess, a certain amount of NH4VO3 (0.17–0.95 g) was dissolved 
in 30 mL of deionized water, and 2.5 g of CTAB and 0.4 g of 
NaOH were dissolved in 150 mL of deionized water. After com‐
plete dissolution, the NH4VO3 solution was added to the tem‐
plate solution under mechanical stirring. After approximately 
30 min, 16.8 mL of TEOS was added dropwise to the mixed 
solution under mechanical stirring. After stirring for 4 h at 60 
°C, the synthesis gel was cooled overnight and then transferred 
into a Teflon™‐lined autoclave and aged at 120 °C for 48 h. The 
obtained materials were centrifuged, washed five times, dried 
at 60 °C for 12 h, and then calcined at 550 °C for 4 h. The sam‐
ples were denoted nV‐MCM‐41, where n represents different 
amounts of V doping varying from 1.9 to 10.6 wt% (ICP re‐
sults). 
2.2.  Catalyst characterizations 
The V and Si contents in nV‐MCM‐41 were recorded using 
ICP‐AES with a Varian Vista MPX. 
The X‐ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of nV‐MCM‐41 cata‐
lysts were collected on a Bragg‐Brentano diffractometer 
(D/Max‐2000, Rigaku Corp., Japan) with monochromatic Cu Kα 
radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The samples were scanned from 2θ 
values of 10° to 60° with a scan speed of 5°/min and from 0.5° 
to 6° with a scan speed of 0.5°/min. The X‐ray tube was manip‐
ulated at 40 kV and 30 mA. 
The specific surface area, total pore volume, and average 
pore diameter were measured at 196 °C by the N2 adsorp‐
tion‐desorption method with an automatic analyzer (NOVA 
4000, Quantachrome, Inc., USA). The samples were degassed in 
a vacuum at 300 °C for 4 h prior to analysis. The specific surface 
area was calculated using the Brunauer‐Emmett‐Teller (BET) 
method. The total pore volume was calculated from the amount 
of vapor adsorbed at a relative pressure (P/P0) close to unity. 
Pore‐size distributions were obtained using the Bar‐
rett‐Joyner‐Halenda (BJH) model. 
Fourier transform‐infrared (FTIR) spectra of the catalysts 
were measured using the KBr wafer technique in a Nicolet 
3800 FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet Corp., USA). The IR spectra 
were recorded in the range 4000–400 cm‒1. 
Raman spectra were recorded using a Jobin Yvon confocal 
laser Raman system (SuperLabRam II), which was equipped 
with a He‐Ne laser at 632.8 nm with a power of approximately 
5 mW. Each spectrum was obtained by three accumulations, 
and the acquisition time was set at 30 s. 
Ultraviolet‐visible (UV‐vis) spectra of the catalysts were 
recorded by the diffuse reflectance technique using a spectro‐
photometer (MPC‐3100, Shimadzu, Corp., Japan) in the range 
200–600 nm, using BaSO4 as the reference. 
Field‐emission scanning‐electron‐microscopy (FESEM) im‐
ages of the catalysts were obtained for the analysis of the mor‐
phologies of surface particles of mesoporous samples using an 
S4800 scanning electron microscope. 
Transmission‐electron‐microscopy (TEM) investigations of 
nV‐MCM‐41 catalytic materials were performed for morpholo‐
gy determinations on a JEM‐2010 ﬁeld‐emission transmission

1101 
electron microscope operated at 200 kV in a vacuum. 
X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze 
the binding‐energy values and atomic surface concentration of 
metal. The XPS measurements were recorded on a Per‐
kin‐Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA X‐ray photoelectron spectrometer 
using Al Kα radiation. All samples were reduced in situ under 
an H2 atmosphere at 580 °C for 2.5 h to improve the dispersion 
of the surface V species. The samples were calibrated using the 
C 1s binding energy at 284.8 eV as an internal standard. 
Temperature‐programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 and 
CO2 measurements was implemented to analyze the acidity and 
alkalinity of the catalysts. The sample (~0.1 g) was pretreated 
at 400 °C for 1 h under a helium flow (30 mL/min) before being 
cooled to 120 °C and saturated with adsorbed gas. After NH3 
adsorption, the sample was purged with He for 15 min. During 
desorption, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was em‐
ployed to record the TPD profiles from 120 to 800 °C, with a 
heating rate of 10 °C /min. 
Temperature‐programmed reduction (TPR) experiments 
were carried out for the catalysts in a programmable tempera‐
ture system. The H2 TPR analysis was tested on a 
Quantachrome IQ system. The sample (0.1 g) was filled in a 
quartz 
reactor, 
which 
was 
heated 
in 
a 
tempera‐
ture‐programmed furnace from room temperature to 800 °C 
(10 °C /min). The reducing gas was a mixture of H2 and Ar gas 
(10% H2). The H2 consumption as a function of the reduction 
temperature was continuously monitored with a TCD cell and 
recorded. 
The samples used for thermogravimetric (TG) analysis were 
dried at 50 °C in air. TG analysis of the catalysts was performed 
on a Shimadzu DTG‐60H thermogravimetric analyzer. The 
sample (0.003−0.005 g) was kept under a N2 atmosphere. The 
temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 °C 
at a rate of increase of 20 °C /min. 
2.3.  Catalytic tests for ODHP reactions 
Catalytic tests were performed in a ﬁxed‐bed quartz reactor, 
which was packed with 0.2 g of catalyst with silica wool at at‐
mospheric pressure. The temperature in the fixed bed of cata‐
lyst particles was monitored with an axially movable thermo‐
couple located inside a quartz capillary. The feed flow consisted 
of C3H8, CO2, and Ar (C3H8/CO2/Ar molar ratio 1/4/4, WHSV = 
1.0 h−1). The reaction temperature was controlled at 600 °C. 
The products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, 
SP‐6980). After the reaction, the reactor was cooled to room 
temperature with pure Ar. The gaseous products (CO and CO2) 
were detected by an online TCD and the other products (CH4, 
C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8) by an FID chromatographic system. 
The conversion of propane, the selectivity of propene, and the 
conversion of CO2 were calculated as follows:

3.  Results and discussion 
3.1.  Mesoporous structure of nV‐MCM‐41 samples 
The small‐angle XRD patterns of nV‐MCM‐41 catalysts are 
shown in Fig. 1(a). One intense peak at 2θ ≈ 2° is due to the 
reflection from the (100) plane of MCM‐41. Apart from this, 
two weak peaks are found in the 2θ range of approximately 4° 
and can be assigned to the (100) and (200) planes, indicating 
that long‐range order of this mesoporous structure is obtained 
[25]. With the loading of V in the samples, the intensity of the 
diffraction peaks decreases, and the main peak is widened, 
which could affect the ordered pore network of the samples or 
lead to a decrease in their crystallinity. As shown in Table 1, 
there is an increase in unit‐cell parameter (a0) owing to the 
replacement of Si4+ (Pauling radius 42 pm) by V5+ (Pauling ra‐

dius 54 pm) as reported in the literature [16,26]. When the V 
concentration reaches 10.6 wt%, the pore structure of MCM‐41 
is partially destroyed. This may be due to bulk V oxides block‐
ing the molecular sieve pores and/or to partial collapse of the 
pore structure. 
Figure 1(b) shows the wide‐angle XRD patterns of V2O5 
samples and nV‐MCM‐41 catalysts with varied V contents. In 
contrast, the samples below 8.8 wt% V content show no char‐
acteristic peaks of V2O5, suggesting that the V species at low 
concentrations still exists in an amorphous state, and that V 
species may be incorporated into the silicate framework or 
highly dispersed on the surface of mesoporous channels, while 
the 10.6V‐MCM‐41 sample shows diffraction peaks of V2O5. It 
can be concluded that the V content is the key factor that de‐
termines whether aggregation or formation of bulk V2O5 crys‐
tallites occurs. 
The N2 adsorption‐desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 2. 
Typical type‐IV isotherms are observed. The capillary conden‐
sation shows a sharp increase in the relative pressure (P/P0) of 
approximately 0.4 for all nV‐MCM‐41 catalysts, suggesting typ‐
ical mesoporous structure with uniform pore diameter, and the 
overall mesoporous structure is well maintained after the addi‐
tion of V species. 
The physical properties, including the speciﬁc surface areas 
(ABET), pore diameters (dp), and pore volumes (Vp) of 
nV‐MCM‐41 and pure MCM‐41 are listed in Table 1. ABET and Vp 
decrease when an increasing amount of V is incorporated, 
while dp maintains a relatively stable size. These behaviors can 
be ascribed to the formation of V‐containing species in the 
pores, which expand the pore structure [19]. When the V con‐
centration increases to 10.6 wt%, ABET decreases significantly, 
which can be attributed to the formation of V2O5 nanoparticles 
in the pore system, which block the channels; this is consistent 
with the following Raman spectroscopy results. 
3.2.  Physico‐chemical characterizations of nV‐MCM‐41  
catalysts 
The FTIR spectra of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3; the 
absorption bands at 802 and 1078 cm−1 over all the catalysts 
are the Si–O–Si external asymmetric stretching vibration and 
external symmetric stretching vibration [27], respectively, in‐
dicating that the silica framework remains unaffected in terms 
of V doping. The bands at 458 and 565 cm−1 are due to the 
Si–O–Si internal tetrahedron vibration absorption peak. The 
bands at around 1635 and 3465 cm–1 are attributed to the 
bending vibration of water molecules and the existence of an 
organic template (CTAB) [28,29]. The characteristic peak of 
Si–O–V bonding at 960 cm−1 is obscured by the strong Si–O–Si 
vibrational band of nV‐MCM‐41 [27], which can be taken as

proof of the incorporation of V atoms in the V‐MCM‐41 frame‐
work [30,31]. The difference between nV‐MCM‐41 catalysts 
and pure MCM‐41 will be further discussed below. 
Raman spectra clearly reveal the differences in nV‐MCM‐41 
catalysts, as shown in Fig. 4. All the samples have weaker Ra‐
man bands at 488, 600, and 836 cm−1, which are attributed to 
the SiO2 support [32]. The band at 1023 cm−1 appears in all 
samples, except for pure MCM‐41, and is assigned to the V=O 
stretching vibration of isolated monovanadate VO43− [31]. With 
the increase in V loading, the peak intensity at the 1023‐cm−1 
band increases obviously, and new bands appear gradually at 
144, 283, 303, 405, 482, 525, 702, and 997 cm−1, which corre‐
spond to V2O5 crystallites [32,33]. The sample containing 6.8 
wt% V loading has no peak at 997 cm−1, which is attributed to 
highly dispersed VO43− and the absence of V2O5 crystallites. 
With the increase in V loading (8.8 and 10.6 wt%), the peak 
intensity at 997 cm−1 increases strongly since V2O5 crystallites 
gradually accumulate and cover the V‐MCM‐41. In particular, 
the catalysts above 6.8‐wt% V loading show additional signals 
at 997 cm−1, and the peak intensity at 1023 cm−1 for the 
6.8‐MCM‐41 catalyst is stronger than the catalysts with lower V 
contents. It is obvious that the 6.8V‐MCM‐41 catalyst has better 
V dispersion than the others, which is consistent with the XPS 
results. 
Figure. 5 shows the UV‐vis spectra of nV‐MCM‐41 catalysts. 
The presence of intense absorption bands at 261 nm is associ‐
ated with the V–O–V characteristic absorption band, which is 
likely due to the d–d charge transfer belonging to highly disper‐
sive tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species incorporated into the 
silicate framework [34]. The bands at approximately 376 nm 
are assigned to extra‐framework V5+ species in distorted octa‐
hedral coordinations [35]. The weak absorption bands at 690 
nm also indicate the formation of polymeric V–O–V bonds, and 
dehydrated samples do not have this band [23,31]. The crystal‐
line V2O5 exhibits UV‐vis absorption over a broad spectral 
range (220–600 nm), with an instance of V2O5 crystal phase in 
the samples [36]. Therefore, the samples of less than 8.8‐wt% V 
doping suggest the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated V, 
whereas the higher V doping (10.6 wt%) contains a large 
amount of V2O5 or pentahedrally coordinated V, which is con‐
sistent with the wide‐angle XRD results. 
The XPS technique was applied to analyze the chemical state 
of elements and the surface composition of the nV‐MCM‐41 
catalysts. Fig. 6 shows the XPS spectra of three representative 
samples. The bands at 515.9 and 517.4 eV of the V 2p3/2 binding 
energies (BEs) can be assigned to V3+ and V5+, respectively. The 
band at 518.8 eV is attributed to highly dispersed isolated 
VO43− [31]. As can be seen in Table 2, the peak area percentage 
at 518.8 eV attains a maximum value of 43% for 6.8V‐MCM‐41, 
indicating that the sample has better V dispersion than others.

This result is consistent with the results of the wide‐angle XRD 
and Raman analyses. Compared with Table 1, the Si/V molar 
ratio of the V‐MCM‐41 sample determined by XPS (obtained 
from the surface) is much higher than that determined by ICP, 
which indicates that most VOx species tend to disperse in the 
silicate framework instead of the support surface. 
The TG curves of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 7. The 
weight loss at approximately 100 °C can be ascribed to the loss 
of surface water, and the weight loss between 200 °C and 450 
°C can be assigned to the decomposition of residual template 
surfactant [37], which results from the association of 
C16H33(CH3)3N+ with Si–O groups from the surface of the inor‐
ganic wall [38]. The weight loss between 450 and 600 °C is 
attributed to the loss of residual template agent connecting to 
the center of Si–O–V [39,40], and that above 600 °C is consid‐
ered to be the result of the removal of water from the conden‐
sation of nearby silicon hydroxyl, namely, the dehydroxylation 
reaction. The weight is almost stable over 600 °C. However, the 
distribution of successive weight losses depends on the 
framework or on the substituted Si‐to‐metal ratio [41]. 
The reduction behavior of the V oxide species doped on 
MCM‐41 was studied using the H2‐TPR technique. Fig. 8 shows 
a gradual increase of hydrogen consumption at approximately 
525–550 °C, which is mainly attributed to the amount of V and 
the reduction of monomeric and oligomeric tetrahedral‐like 
coordinated VOx species [42–44]. The samples with lower V 
loading exhibit lower reduction temperatures. The wide‐angle 
XRD and Raman results verify the formation of bulk V2O5 or the 
degree of polymerization of V oxide at high V doping. There‐
fore, at high V doping, the nV‐MCM‐41 catalysts exhibit a 
high‐temperature reduction peak. This is the most important 
reason for the decrease in catalytic activity for ODHP. 
The acidic characteristics of the supported nV‐MCM‐41 cat‐
alysts were investigated by NH3‐TPD, and the results are shown 
in Fig. 9. It is well known that the dehydrogenation perfor‐
mance of light paraffin is closely related to the acidic properties 
of a catalyst’s surface [28,45]. Obviously, all the catalysts sup‐
ported on mesoporous silica MCM‐41 show a relatively sharp 
desorption peak from 130–260 °C, which is ascribed to weak 
Lewis acid sites of the isolated tetrahedral‐like coordinated VOx 
species [46–49]. The desorption peaks at 260–500 °C and 
above 500 °C can be ascribed to medium and strong acid sites, 
respectively. With increasing V doping, it can be seen from the 
profiles that the intensities of weak‐ and medium‐acid desorp‐
tion peaks increase and move to the high‐temperature zone, 
indicating the increase in weak‐ and medium‐acid sites. These 
results imply that the acidity can be improved by increasing V 
doping. 
3.3.  Morphology 
FESEM images of samples with different V contents are 
shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that pure MCM‐41 mainly exists 
as spherical particles with a particle size distribution of 
150–250 nm. With a small amount of V doping (1.9 and 3.7 
wt%), the spherical particle size becomes large. After the in‐
troduction of V species, the morphology of the samples changes 
from ordered spherical particles to disordered morphologies. 
During the hydrolytic process, V ions may contact the silica 
source and be incorporated into the framework, resulting in a

change in catalyst morphology. 
TEM images of the 6.8V‐MCM‐41 sample are displayed in 
Fig. 11. When the electron beam falls on the sample perpendic‐
ular to the pore channel, the pores are seen to be arranged in 
patches composed of regular rows; when the electron beam is 
parallel to the pore channel axis, a hexagonal array with a 
channel dimension of approximately 3 nm is revealed. The TEM 
images reveal that the highly ordered nanoporous structure of 
MCM‐41 is preserved after loading V oxide into the silicate 
framework, which is entirely consistent with the small angle 
XRD and BET results. 
3.4.  Catalytic performance of nV‐MCM‐41 catalysts in the ODHP 
reaction 
3.3.1.  Effect of amounts of V doping  
The catalytic activity of nV‐MCM‐41 and pure MCM‐41 on 
the ODHP reaction was evaluated and the results presented in 
Fig. 12. The pure MCM‐41 exhibits very low catalytic activity 
and propene selectivity. With the loading of V, propane conver‐
sion and propene selectivity are both markedly enhanced, and 
propane conversion gradually increases as the V content in‐
creases, until 6.8 wt% is reached. For the 6.8V‐MCM‐41 cata‐
lyst, an initial propane conversion of 58% accompanied by a 
propene selectivity of ~92% is obtained. When the V doping 
exceeds 6.8 wt%, the propane conversion gradually decreases 
for 8.8V‐MCM‐41 and 10.6V‐MCM‐41 catalysts, suggesting that 
over‐high vanadium loading in the MCM‐41 framework is dis‐
advantageous to propane oxidative dehydrogenation, possibly 
due to the formation of V2O5 crystallites [28,50]. This has been 
verified by the wide‐angle XRD and Raman results. It has been 
suggested that metal species of octahedrally coordinated V2O5 
have low activity in the dehydrogenation reaction because of 
the lack of free coordination sites [24]. As reported in the pre‐
vious work [51], with a similar V content, mesoporous 
SBA‐15‐supported V oxide catalysts exhibited a propane con‐
version of 40% accompanied by a propene selectivity of ~57% 
under similar reaction conditions. It is clear that the 
6.8V‐MCM‐41 catalyst exhibits much higher C3H8 conversion 
and propene selectivity than mesoporous, traditional sili‐
ca‐supported VOx catalysts. The excellent catalytic performance 
could be related to highly dispersed V oxide on the large 
speciﬁc surface of MCM‐41 with a highly ordered mesoporous

structure, as described by the BET results. The NH3‐TPD results 
indicate that high V doping increases the number of acidic sites, 
which reduces propene release from the V active sites, result‐
ing in deep oxidation and carbon deposition. 
3.3.2.  Effect of CO2 partial pressure on the ODHP reaction 
Fig. 13 shows the CO2 conversion in the ODHP reaction over 
6.8V‐MCM‐41 catalysts. It can be seen that CO2 conversion is 
maintained at 10% throughout the reaction period, which is the 
same as other nV‐MCM‐41 catalysts (1.9–10.6 wt% V doping). 
The reaction mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation in the 
presence of CO2 includes a reaction coupling mechanism 
[52,53] and a “lattice oxygen” mechanism [54,55], which can be 
expressed as the reaction coupling of simple propane dehy‐
drogenation with the reverse water‐gas shift (RWGS) reaction 
and the lattice oxygen of isolated tetrahedral VO43−. It is illus‐
trated in Scheme 1. 
The 
reason 
that 
the 
highest 
catalytic 
activity 
of 
6.8V‐MCM‐41 has a high degree of dispersion of isolated VO43− 
has been verified by Raman and XPS analysis. Scheme 1 shows 
the reaction and regeneration scheme for the CO2 oxidative 
dehydrogenation over nV‐MCM‐41 catalysts. In the first step, 
the O of a vanadyl (O=V) group abstracts a H atom from a sec‐
ondary C atom of propane. The second H abstraction occurs at 
the oxygen of the V–O–Si bond, yielding H2O·VIII, or at a fresh 
vanadyl (O=V) group, yielding two HOVIV species; propene is 
then released from the V active site. A similar process has been 
reported by DFT calculation and microkinetic simulation [21]. 
In this reaction cycle, the presence of CO2 can make the 
RWGS reaction proceed toward CO generation, and propene 
production increases. CO2 acting as a mild oxidant also pre‐
vents the decrease of active sites, which is due to the fast 
re‐oxidation of V3+ to V5+. 
Fig. 14 shows the effect of CO2 partial pressure on 
6.8V‐MCM‐41 catalysts. As can be seen from Fig. 14, propane 
conversion and propene selectivity significantly increase in the 
presence of CO2. With increasing CO2/C3H8 ratios, propane 
conversion increases gradually, while propene selectivity ex‐
hibits almost no variation. Propane conversion with a C3H8/CO2 
molar ratio of 1:5 is similar to that with a C3H8/CO2 molar ratio 
of 1:4 in Fig. 12. It has been verified that moderately increasing 
the C3H8/CO2 ratio (1:4) is advantageous to the catalytic activi‐
ty on the propane dehydrogenation reaction, as described in 
Scheme 1.

3.3.3.  Recycling of catalysts 
Figure 15 shows the regeneration performance of the 
6.8V‐MCM‐41 catalyst. After the reaction‐regeneration study 
with four cycles, the catalyst still shows good reactivity. Pro‐
pane conversion and propene selectivity are almost the same 
as the initial reactions because the lattice oxygen of isolated 
VO43– is almost completely restored after regeneration by O2 at 
550 °C. The regeneration cycle mechanism is demonstrated in 
Scheme 1. The regeneration performance also benefits from the 
superior thermal stability of the nV‐MCM‐41 mesoporous sili‐
con framework, which has been proved by TG analysis. As 
shown in Fig. 15, propane conversion decreases to approxi‐
mately 40% after the first 120 min period. This decrease is 
mainly due to the reduction of the active V sites, which is dis‐
played in Scheme 1. To further investigate the causes of catalyst 
deactivation, TG analysis of the deactivated 6.8V‐MCM‐41 cata‐
lyst after 120 min of the ODHP reaction was carried out, and 
the results are shown in Fig. 16. The weight decrease below 
200 °C can be ascribed to the loss of surface adsorption water. 
The weight loss in the range 200–350 °C can be attributed to 
coke deposits formed on the surface of the VOx sites [56]. Coke 
deposited directly on the surface of active VOx sites shields 
them from propane, and consequently, results in catalyst deac‐
tivation [57]. The deactivation of catalysts in the ODHP reaction 
is caused by the reduction of the active V sites and coke depos‐
its formed on the surface of VOx sites. These factors can be 
eliminated by oxidative regeneration, and excellent catalytic 
activity of the 6.8V‐MCM‐41 catalyst can be maintained after 
four cycles. 
4.  Conclusions 
The catalytic performance of nV‐MCM‐41 catalysts prepared 
by one‐step methods was examined in ODHP using CO2 as an 
oxidant. The results of XRD, BET, SEM, and TEM analyses con‐
firm that the nV‐MCM‐41 catalysts maintain a highly ordered 
mesoporous structure, except for the catalysts with excessively 
high V loading, which partially destroys the pore structure of 
MCM‐41. FTIR, UV‐vis, XPS, Raman, and H2‐TPR analyses prove 
the existence of highly dispersed, isolated tetrahedral VO43− 
active sites. As V is doped into the framework of MCM‐41, the 
catalysts maintain a high specific surface area and superior 
thermal stability. The 6.8V‐MCM‐41 catalyst exhibits highly 
active and stable catalytic performance for ODHP, which is due 
to the high dispersion of isolated VO43−. However, upon further 
increasing the V loading (8.8 and 10.6 wt%), the number of 
acidic sites and V2O5 crystallites increases, which reduces the 
reaction activity. It is verified that moderately increasing the 
C3H8/CO2 ratio (1:4) of steam is advantageous to the catalytic 
activity in ODHP. It is worth mentioning that the nV‐MCM‐41 
catalyst performs very well even after four oxidative regenera‐
tions.

摘要: 丙烯是一种重要的化工原料, 其下游产品丰富, 用途广泛, 主要用于生产聚丙烯、
丙烯腈、
丙烯酸和丁醇等化工产品.  
丙烯的需求正在不断增长, 而传统的丙烯生产方法如蒸汽裂解和石油催化裂化, 存在反应温度高、积碳严重且丙烯收率较
低等问题.  因此研制丙烷脱氢制取丙烯的高效催化剂尤为重要.  研究发现, 以 CO2 作为温和氧化剂进行逆水气变换反应可
有效促进丙烷脱氢.  催化剂主要由活性组分与载体构成, 本文选择可用于活化丙烷的钒作为主要活性组分.  钒氧化物在载
体上的高度分散是提高丙烷脱氢反应活性的关键.  MCM-41 拥有较大的比表面积和高度有序的介孔结构, 可更有效地分
散活性位点.  本文采用一步法合成了不同钒含量的 nV-MCM-41 催化剂 (1.9−10.6 wt%), 并研究了其在以下条件下催化丙
烷氧化脱氢制丙烯反应性能: 600 °C, 催化剂质量 0.2 g, 进料气体组成 C3H8/CO2/Ar (摩尔比) = 1/4/4, 进料气体总流量 15 
mL/min.  其中 6.8V-MCM-41 催化剂具有最高的活性, 其初始丙烷转化率达 58%, 丙烯选择性达 92%, 远高于相似反应条件
下早期研究的 nV-SBA-15 催化剂.  并在四次反应-再生循环中始终保持其原来的高反应活性.  本文借助于 N2 吸附-脱附、
拉曼光谱 (Raman)、X 射线光电子能谱 (XPS)和热重 (TG) 等手段探究了不同钒含量的 nV-MCM-41 催化剂在丙烷脱氢反
应中催化性能差异的原因.   
氮气吸附-脱附结果表明, 所有催化剂都存在典型的高度有序的介孔结构, 并没有因为钒组分的掺杂而破坏.  
nV-MCM-41 催化剂拥有较大比表面积, 并随钒掺杂量的增加而减小.  其中, 10.8V-MCM-41 催化剂的比表面积急剧下降, 
可能是由于产生了结晶的 V2O5 阻塞了孔道.  Raman 结果表明, 当钒负载量超过 6.8 wt% 时, 出现了 V2O5 的结晶峰.  另外
根据单分散的四面体钒氧化物的特征峰面积发现, 6.8V-MCM-41 催化剂中钒物种分散度最高, 与其具有最高催化活性结
果一致.  XPS 结果也进一步证明 6.8V-MCM-41 钒物种的分散度最高.  在连续反应过程中 6.8V-MCM-41 催化剂失活较快, 
可归结于活性钒位点的还原与催化剂表面的积碳.  通过氧化再生, 可恢复催化剂活性, 并且在 4 次再生循环中始终保持其
良好稳定的活性.
