In this paper, we use the hydrogenation and reforming reactions to demonstrate the success and chal-
lenges in correlating bimetallic model surfaces with supported catalysts. For hydrogenation reactions,
results from ultra-high vacuum (UHV) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations of
model surfaces typically show strong correlation with reactor evaluations of the corresponding sup-
ported catalysts. However, such correlation is less clear for reforming reactions, which require a strong
bonding of oxygenates on the bimetallic surfaces. One of the challenges is to understand the bimetallic
structures and their stability under reaction conditions, which would in turn provide critical input for
constructing relevant model surfaces for UHV and DFT studies. In order to truly achieve the design of
bimetallic catalysts from ﬁrst principles, it is essential that the structures of model surfaces are as close
as possible to those under reaction conditions.

1. Introduction
Bimetallic catalysts often show catalytic properties that are dis-
tinctly different from those of their parent metals and offer the
opportunity to design new materials with enhanced catalytic activ-
ity, selectivity, and stability. Bimetallic catalysts started to gain
considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in
hydrocarbon reforming, because they displayed activities unlike
those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts [1,2]. The ﬁnd-
ings of these unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have in-
spired extensive investigations on the possible applications of
different bimetallic catalysts. Currently, bimetallic catalysts are
widely utilized in many heterogeneous catalysis [3–5] and electro-
catalysis [6,7] applications.
In order to understand the origins of the novel bimetallic prop-
erties, model surfaces on single-crystal substrates have been the
subject of many experimental and theoretical studies, as summa-
rized in several reviews [8–10]. For example, Goodman and
coworkers found a strong dependence of the CO desorption tem-
perature and the core electron energy shift in a wide range of
bimetallic surfaces [11,12]. Madey and coworkers performed
extensive investigations in correlating the structural, electronic,
and chemical properties on faceting surfaces of bimetallic systems
[13]. Chen and coworkers identiﬁed signiﬁcant differences be-
tween bimetallic surfaces with an admetal residing on the surface
and in the subsurface of another metal substrate [14–16]. In paral-
lel, extensive theoretical calculations using density functional the-
ory (DFT) have been performed to understand the origin of the
unique bimetallic properties. For example, DFT calculations by
Neurock et al. [17], Greeley and Marvrikakis [18] and Kitchin
et al. [19], among many others, have identiﬁed at least two critical
factors that contribute to the modiﬁcation of the electronic and
chemical properties of a metal in a bimetallic surface. First, the for-
mation of the hetero-atom bonds changes the electronic environ-
ment of the metal surface, giving rise to modiﬁcations of its
electronic structure through the ligand effect. Second, the geome-
try of the bimetallic structure is typically different from that of
the parent metals, e.g., the average metal–metal bond lengths
change, resulting in the strain effect that is known to modify the
electronic structure of the metal through changes in orbital
overlap.
While experimental and theoretical studies on model bimetallic
surfaces provide fundamental insights into their novel catalytic
properties, in an industrially relevant supported catalyst, the active
metal will be present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-sur-
face-area support. In order to achieve correlations between model
surfaces and supported catalysts, it is critical to bridge the well-
documented ‘‘materials gap’’ between model surfaces and sup-
ported catalysts, as well as the ‘‘pressure gap’’ between ultra-high
vacuum (UHV) conditions and the reaction environment. These

challenges are even more critical in bimetallic catalysts because
their surface structures and compositions often change depending
on the reaction environment.
In the current paper, we will use selected examples from our
group, including both previously published work and recent re-
sults, to identify challenges and opportunities in correlating the
structural and catalytic properties of bimetallic model surfaces
with those of supported catalysts. In the ﬁrst example, we will
use the hydrogenation of cyclohexene over PtA3d (3d = Fe, Co,
Ni, Cu) bimetallic catalysts as a probe reaction to demonstrate
the successful correlation between single-crystal surfaces, poly-
crystalline ﬁlms, and supported catalysts. The successful correla-
tion is primarily due to the fact that the Pt-terminated surface
structure is thermodynamically preferred in both model surfaces,
under UHV conditions, and supported catalysts, under a hydroge-
nation environment. In the second example, we will use the
reforming of ethylene glycol to produce CO and H2 over PtA3d cat-
alysts to demonstrate the effect of reaction environment on the
surface structures of bimetallic catalysts. While the Pt-terminated
structure is preferred for model surfaces under UHV conditions and
for supported catalysts after H2 reduction, most of the subsurface
Ni atoms segregate to produce a Ni-terminated surface under
reforming conditions, making the correlation less clear. We will
then provide recent results on alternative catalysts to potentially
solve the structural changes in bimetallic catalysts. We will con-
clude by discussing the importance, challenges, and opportunities
in applying fundamental surface science studies to predict active
and stable bimetallic structures for catalysis.
2. Preparation and characterization of bimetallic surfaces
Procedures for the preparation of bimetallic surface structures
under UHV conditions have been described in detail previously
[4,10]. As shown in Fig. 1 for a 3d metal monolayer on a Pt(111)
substrate, bimetallic surfaces can have three idealized conﬁgura-
tions: a surface 3dAPtAPt(111) conﬁguration, with the 3d metal
residing on the surface of the Pt substrate; an intermixed conﬁgu-
ration, where the 3d atoms reside in the ﬁrst two Pt layers to some
varying degree; and the subsurface PtA3dAPt(111) conﬁguration,
where the monolayer of 3d metal atoms is beneath the top layer of
Pt. Under UHV conditions, the 3dAPtAPt(111) surface and the
PtA3dAPt(111) subsurface structures can be prepared by control-
ling the temperature of the Pt(111) substrate [10]. For example,
when the 3d metal is deposited onto a Pt(111) surface at 300 K,
the 3d
atoms stay on the top-most layer to produce the
3dAPtAPt(111) surface conﬁguration. If this surface is heated to
600 K, or if the monolayer deposition of the 3d metal occurs when
the Pt(111) substrate is held at 600 K, most of the 3d atoms diffuse
into the subsurface region and produce the PtA3dAPt(111) sub-
surface structure.
Among monolayer bimetallic surfaces, the surface composition
and structure of Ni/Pt(111) have been extensively studied using a
variety of UHV surface techniques [4,15]. For example, the mono-
layer NiAPtAPt(111) surface structure was conﬁrmed using
Low-Energy Ion Spectroscopy (LEIS) and Scanning Tunneling Spec-
troscopy (STM). The LEIS results also conﬁrmed that Pt atoms seg-
regated to the top-most surface layer upon annealing to 600 K, and
the STM images showed surface strain that was related to the pres-
ence of subsurface Ni atoms. Quantitative analysis of the Ni and Pt
peak intensities, using Auger Electron Spectroscopy, suggested that
the monolayer Ni atoms mainly remained between the ﬁrst and
second Pt layers. The relative stability of the surface and subsurface
bimetallic structures depends on the reaction environment, more
speciﬁcally on the type of adsorbates on the surface. The stability
of bimetallic surfaces was studied by calculating the segregation
energies of different bimetallic combinations,
with Ni(111),
Pd(111), and Pt(111) as the substrates [20]. As shown in Fig. 2, a
linear correlation was observed between the difference in the sur-
face-occupied d-band center (x-axis) and the thermodynamic po-
tential for segregation, DEseg (y-axis). For a given bimetallic
system, M1/M2, a positive DEseg value indicates that the subsurface
M2–M1–M2(111) structure is stable, and a negative value suggests
that the surface M1–M2–M2(111) conﬁguration is thermodynami-
cally preferred [20]. As shown in Fig. 2, for all the bimetallic sys-
tems, the subsurface conﬁguration was predicted to be preferred
in vacuum with adsorbed H at a coverage of 0.5 monolayer (ML),
while the surface structure was preferred with the adsorption of
0.5 ML O. In addition, the linear correlation in Fig. 2 led to a
semi-empirical equation that allowed the prediction of stable
structures of other bimetallic systems and with other adsorbates.
For example, similar to adsorbed O, the surface M1–M2–M2(111)
structure was predicted to be stable with adsorbed atomic nitrogen
and sulfur [20]. The DFT-predicted stability was veriﬁed experi-
mentally for several bimetallic systems. For example, for mono-
layer Ni on a Pt substrate, it was determined experimentally that
Ni diffused into Pt to form the subsurface (Pt-terminated) structure
in the presence of hydrogen, while the Ni atoms segregated to form
the surface (Ni-terminated) conﬁguration in the presence of oxy-
gen [21].
The ﬁndings of adsorbate-induced metal diffusion and segrega-
tion should lead to different catalytic properties and will be the
central topic of the current paper. Among the bimetallic surfaces
to be discussed in the current paper, the 3dAPt(111) systems are
located at the far right side of Fig. 2, where there is a large thermo-
dynamic potential for 3d metals to diffuse into Pt(111) in hydro-
gen and to segregate on top of Pt(111) in oxygen. In contrast,
bimetallic systems located at the far left of Fig. 2 should have less

example being the Fe/Ni(111) bimetallic surface that will be dis-
cussed later.
3. Correlating model surfaces with supported catalysts
3.1. Hydrogenation reactions: a successful correlation
Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogena-
tion because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction interme-
diates in many reﬁnery and petrochemical processes, in addition
to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the
chemical industry. Furthermore, cyclohexene has several competi-
tive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogena-
tion, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation.
Comparative studies of these reaction pathways provide an oppor-
tunity to compare differences in the hydrogenation activity and
selectivity between bimetallic and the corresponding monometal-
lic surfaces and catalysts.
3.1.1. Model surfaces
DFT calculations were performed to compare the hydrogen and
cyclohexene binding energies on several 3dAPtAPt(111) and
PtA3dAPt(111) bimetallic structures. The main purpose of these
calculations is to identify whether binding energies can be used
as descriptors to correlate with hydrogenation activity. Fig. 3a
shows that the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) is related to the po-
sition of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level
[22], consistent with the trend observed in previous studies for
other surfaces [10]. In general, the addition of a monolayer of 3d
metals on Pt(111) shifts the d-band center closer to the Fermi le-
vel, compared to that of the bulk 3d metals, which is primarily due
to the tensile strain induced by the Pt lattice [19]. On the other
hand, the presence of subsurface 3d metals in the second layer
moves the surface d-band center of Pt away from the Fermi level,
as compared with that of Pt(111), mainly attributed to the
electronic interaction of Pt and the subsurface 3d atoms [19]. A
nearly linear correlation between HBE and the surface d-band
center is observed, which typically follows the trend of HA3dA
PtAPt(111) > HAPt(111) > HAPtA3dAPt(111).
The binding energies of cyclohexene on the 3dAPtAPt(111) and
PtA3dAPt(111) surfaces follow the same trend as HBE, as shown
in Fig. 3b. The subsurface PtA3dAPt(111) structures bond to cyclo-
hexene
more
weakly
than
Pt(111)
and
the
corresponding
3dAPtAPt(111) surface conﬁgurations. For example, for the Ni/
Pt(111) system, DFT results show that both atomic hydrogen and
cyclohexene
are
more
weakly
bonded
on
subsurface
PtANiAPt(111) than on NiAPtAPt(111), Pt(111), and Ni(111)
surfaces. For hydrogenation reactions, one would expect surfaces
that bond to atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene more weakly
would have a higher hydrogenation rate, suggesting that the sub-
surface PtANiAPt(111) structure should be more active for the
low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the other
three
surfaces.
This
hypothesis
was
veriﬁed
experimentally
through
hydrogenation
of
cyclohexene
using
temperature-
programmed desorption (TPD), as shown in Fig. 4a [22]. As illustrated
in the TPD peak area of the product, cyclohexane, the subsurface
PtANiAPt(111) structure shows the highest hydrogenation yield,
with the desorption peak centered at a very low hydrogenation
temperature of 203 K. In order to determine whether such a trend
can be extended to other Pt crystalline surfaces, TPD measure-
ments we also performed on a polycrystalline Pt foil that contained
mainly the (111) and (100) facets, as shown in Fig. 4b [23]. Mono-
layer Ni was deposited on the Pt foil at room temperature, followed
by annealing to higher temperatures to produce the PtANiAPt sub-
surface structure. Similar to the corresponding single-crystal sur-
faces, the subsurface PtANiAPt polycrystalline structure showed
signiﬁcantly higher hydrogenation yield than the polycrystalline
Pt and Ni surfaces. These results indicate that the trend observed
on single-crystal bimetallic surfaces can be extended to their poly-
crystalline counterparts.
Furthermore, the trend in the DFT calculations for the different
PtA3dAPt(111) subsurface conﬁgurations, in Fig. 3b, shows that
the
binding
energies
of
cyclohexene
are
even
weaker
on
PtACoAPt(111) and PtAFeAPt(111) than that on PtANiAPt(111).
Although the former two surfaces with lower cyclohexene binding
energies might be more active toward hydrogenation, the adsorp-
tion of cyclohexene still needs to be strong enough for hydrogena-
tion to take place. Therefore, a volcano relationship is expected for
cyclohexene hydrogenation activity as the d-band center moves
further away from the Fermi level, i.e., when the adsorption of
cyclohexene becomes too weak for hydrogenation to occur. This
is veriﬁed experimentally in the results shown in Fig. 5. The hydro-
genation yield is found to be the highest on PtANiAPt(111) but
starts to decrease on the PtACoAPt(111) and PtAFeAPt(111) sur-
faces, where the binding of cyclohexene becomes too weak for
hydrogenation to occur. On the other side of the volcano curve,
for the 3dAPtAPt(111) surfaces, the binding energies of cyclohex-
ene are too strong and prevent the effective hydrogenation of
cyclohexene [22].
3.1.2. Supported catalysts
The comparison in Fig. 5 revealed that the hydrogenation
yield in
TPD
measurements
followed
the trend
of
PtANiA
Pt(111) > PtACoAPt(111) > Pt(111). In order to verify whether
such a trend could be extended to supported catalysts, the corre-
sponding monometallic and bimetallic catalysts were synthesized
over c-Al2O3 supports and evaluated in batch and ﬂow reactors
for cyclohexene hydrogenation [24]. One of the critical questions
that needed to be addressed was whether the supported bimetallic

catalysts
had
the
conﬁguration
relevant
to
the
subsurface
structure, i.e., bimetallic particles with Pt-terminated surfaces. As
suggested from the model surface results in Fig. 2, the Pt-termi-
nated surface should be thermodynamically preferred for PtACo
and PtANi catalysts in vacuum or in the presence of hydrogen
[20]. Because supported catalysts were typically subjected to
reduction in hydrogen at 723 K prior to catalytic evaluation, it
was expected that the surface termination would be Pt instead of
Ni or Co.
Fig. 6 shows the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of ad-
sorbed CO in an in situ reaction cell, under 1 torr of CO at room
temperature, following the standard H2 reduction procedures of
PtANi catalysts with different Pt/Ni atomic ratios, along with the
monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts [4,25]. It is well documented that
the vibrational frequencies of adsorbed CO are distinct for different
metals [26–29]. Although all catalysts in Fig. 6 showed a vibra-
tional feature at 2061 cm1 from CO adsorbing on the atop sites,
the peak of CO binding through at bridge sites was at 1945 cm1
for Ni and at 1841 cm1 for Pt. In comparison, the vibrational fre-
quency of bridge-bonded CO on the bimetallic catalysts, in partic-
ular for the 1PtA1Ni/c-Al2O3 (1:1 atomic ratio of Pt/Ni) and
1PtA3Ni/c-Al2O3, was similar to that of monometallic 1Pt/c-
Al2O3, suggesting that the bimetallic particles were primarily Pt-
terminated.
Complementary information from extended X-ray absorption
ﬁne structure (EXAFS) measurements at room temperature in 5%
H2 in He conﬁrms the Pt-terminated assertion. The PtAPt bond dis-
tance of the PtANi/c-Al2O3 catalyst, obtained through EXAFS ﬁt-
ting, is 2.72 ± 0.01 Å, which is 0.04–0.06 Å smaller than the bulk
metallic PtAPt distance (2.77 Å). The PtAPt interatomic distance
suggests that Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are strained. If
the surfaces of the bimetallic nanoparticles were Ni-terminated,
a strain effect would not be apparent in the PtAPt interatomic dis-
tances. A monolayer of the larger, Pt atoms on top of smaller, Ni
atoms would cause a much greater strain, as seen in the PtAPt
interatomic distances. This supports the assertion shown by the
FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO that Pt atoms reside on the sur-
face of the bimetallic nanoparticles. The structural model for the
proposed PtANi bimetallic particle is shown at the top of Fig. 6
[25].
After establishing the Pt-termination of the supported catalysts,
the hydrogenation activity was evaluated at 303 K over supported

PtANi/c-Al2O3, PtACo/c-Al2O3, and Pt/c-Al2O3 catalysts [24]. The
reactor was initially dosed with a total pressure of 5.5 torr of
H2 gas and cyclohexene vapor mixed at a 2:1 partial pressure ratio.
Fig. 7 shows the results using a batch reactor equipped with FTIR,
for monitoring the concentration of reactants and products as a
function of reaction time. Fig. 7a and b show the consumption of
cyclohexene and production of cyclohexane, respectively. The solid
lines are ﬁttings using the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model, result-
ing in a hydrogenation rate constant of 24, 21, and 1.7 min1,
respectively, for the three catalysts. The trend observed in the rate
constants of cyclohexene hydrogenation was consistent with that
from the TPD yield from the corresponding model surfaces
(Fig. 5). The observation of a similar trend between model surfaces
and supported catalysts provides an important demonstration of
the possibility of designing bimetallic hydrogenation catalysts
from combined theoretical and experimental approaches on model
surfaces.
3.1.3. General trends in correlating hydrogenation activity
The main reason for the successful correlation between model
surfaces and supported catalysts is that the desirable bimetallic
structures for hydrogenation reactions, the PtA3dAPt subsurface
conﬁguration on single-crystal and polycrystalline substrates and
Pt-terminated structures in supported catalysts, are thermody-
namically stable in UHV environments and under hydrogenation
reaction conditions. Similar correlations have led to the utilization
of PtA3d bimetallic catalysts for the low-temperature hydrogena-
tion of the C@C bond in conjugated hydrocarbons (1,3-butadiene
[25]) and aromatic molecules (benzene [24]), as well as the hydro-
genation of the C@O bond in propanal [30] and acrolein [14,31].
Similar to that demonstrated in Fig. 3 for cyclohexene, the en-
hanced hydrogenation activity for other molecules are attributed
to the weaker binding energy of the C@C or C@O bond to the desir-
able bimetallic surfaces. These examples illustrate the feasibility of
achieving unique hydrogenation activities through the formation
of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. Because calculations of binding
energies require signiﬁcant less time and are more straightforward
than those for hydrogenation activation barriers, the binding ener-
gies on model surfaces can be used as descriptors to relatively
quickly identify promising bimetallic compositions and structures
for hydrogenation reactions.
3.2. Reforming reactions: less successful correlation
Selective reforming of oxygenates is a promising way to pro-
duce hydrogen for use in fuel cells, as syngas for production of
chemicals and fuels, and in upgrading of biomass-derived feed-
stocks [32–34]. If the oxygenates are derived from renewable bio-
mass, the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2
by-product can be consumed by future biomass growth. Ethylene
glycol is one of the ideal probe molecules for identifying reforming
catalysts for several reasons. It contains all the essential chemical
bonds, CAH, OAH, CAO and CAC, that are present in complex bio-
mass-derived oxygenates; the molecule is small enough to allow
relatively facile DFT calculations of the activation barriers for var-
ious bond scission sequences; it has a high enough vapor pressure
for UHV experiments on model surfaces and vapor-phase reactor
evaluation over supported catalysts, yet it is in liquid form for
aqueous phase studies. As a probe molecule, it provides the oppor-
tunity for direct correlation between DFT and UHV studies on mod-
el surfaces and for the determination of bimetallic stability under
vapor and aqueous phase reaction conditions.
3.2.1. Model surfaces
The reforming yields from the TPD experiments of ethylene gly-
col on 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces (3d = Ni, Fe and Ti) are corre-
lated with the surface d-band center values, as shown in Fig. 8 [33].
In general, surfaces with a d-band center closer to the Fermi level
exhibit higher reforming activity. For example, for Ni/Pt(111), the
reforming yield, as measured experimentally for H2 and CO
production,
followed
the
trend
of
NiAPtAPt(111) >
Ni(111) > Pt(111) > PtANiAPt(111). This trend was opposite of
that observed for hydrogenation reactions (Figs. 4 and 5) and
was due to the fact that CAC bond scission in reforming required
more strongly bonded adsorbates. One interesting observation, in
Fig. 8, was as the d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level,
corresponding to stronger bonding between the adsorbate and
the bimetallic surfaces, the reforming yield appeared to decrease,

bonds [33].
Among the bimetallic surfaces in Fig. 8, the decomposition
mechanism on NiAPtAPt(111) was investigated in greater detail,
using a combination of DFT calculations of activation barriers, for
the entire reaction network and parallel TPD studies of isotope-
labeled ethylene glycol [35]. These results revealed that the pres-
ence of surface Ni on Pt(111) enhanced the rate of the OAH bond
scission for both of the hydroxyl groups, which was one of the
kinetically limiting steps for ethylene glycol reforming on unmod-
iﬁed Pt(111). Therefore, a key challenge for supported PtANi
catalysts was to generate and then maintain the Ni-terminated
surface structure under reforming conditions, as described below.
3.2.2. Supported catalysts
Unlike hydrogenation reactions, the correlation between DFT
and UHV studies on model surfaces and reactor evaluation over
supported catalysts is not as clear for the reforming of ethylene
glycol. In the case of reforming, the desirable catalyst structure is
Ni-terminated, which is opposite to that of the Pt-termination for
hydrogenation. EXAFS measurements were performed to deter-
mine if restructuring occurred in supported PtANi catalysts under
aqueous phase reforming (APR) conditions. The APR condition used
was 10 v/v% ethylene glycol in H2O at 498 K and 450 psig. Coordi-
nation numbers (CN) from in situ EXAFS measurements can give
valuable
information
regarding
the
structure
of
bimetallic
particles. Table 1 shows EXAFS measurements collected on the Pt
LIII-edge of PtANi/C, after reduction in 10% H2 in He at 723 K and
during the course of APR of ethylene glycol [36]. After obtaining
PtAPt and PtANi CN values, Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simula-
tions were performed to model the arrangement of Pt and Ni atoms
within a bimetallic particle. This technique has been previously
used to model EXAFS data on crystalline and amorphous systems
[37,38].
Data from Table 1 shows the CN values for experimental and
simulation results under different reaction environments, indi-
cated in the caption of Table 1 [36]. Clearly, the PtAPt CN value in-
creased, while that of PtANi decreased from reduction to APR
conditions. The increase in the PtAPt CN suggested that Pt moved
into the bulk of the particle, while the decrease in the PtANi CN
suggested the segregation of Ni to the surface. These observations
are shown in the particle illustrations at the bottom of Table 1. It is
also interesting to note that the total Pt coordination number
(PtAPt + PtANi) increased under APR conditions from 5.8 to 7.9
and then remained high at 7.4 after re-reduction in 10% H2 in He
at 723 K. The larger total CN after APR indicates sintering of the
PtANi nanoparticles. The corresponding reactor data demonstrated
that PtANi/C exhibited nearly a 50% increase in the turn over fre-
quency (TOF) of CO2 and H2 production over Pt/C for APR of ethyl-
ene glycol, consistent with the formation of the Ni-terminated
surface under APR conditions by EXAFS [36]. However, the facile
movement of the Pt and Ni atoms under APR exempliﬁes some of
the challenges in understanding the long-term stability of bimetal-
lic catalysts under reaction environments.
3.2.3. Stability issues and potential solutions
For ethylene glycol reforming, the correlation between model
bimetallic surfaces and supported catalysts is less clear because

The
3dAPtAPt(111) bimetallic conﬁguration that is favorable for
reforming is not stable at high temperatures [20], because the sur-
face monolayer 3d atoms diffuse into the Pt bulk [15] and lead to
signiﬁcantly diminished activity. Therefore, identifying an alterna-
tive catalyst with higher thermal stability than the 3dAPtAPt(111)
surfaces, while maintaining a similar reforming activity is very
important. Metal carbides possess some Pt-like properties [39–
44] and are regarded as an alternative class of materials to replace
Pt in PtA3d bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. Tungsten monocar-
bide (WC) is also reported to be an effective barrier to prevent
the diffusion of the metal overlayer into the bulk [45], as conﬁrmed
by a previous study of the thermal behavior of surface Ni on a WC
substrate [46]. Fig. 9 displays the TPD spectra of the reforming
products (H2 and CO) after exposing ethylene glycol onto WC
and Ni-modiﬁed WC surfaces [47]. The Ni–WC surface showed a
much higher reforming yield than that of unmodiﬁed WC. Further
studies of other C2 oxygenates, such glycolaldehyde [48], acetalde-
hyde [47] and acetic acid [47], further conﬁrmed that the ML Ni-
modiﬁed WC surface possessed similar reforming activity as the
NiAPtAPt(111) surface but with higher stability and lower cost.
Another approach to overcoming the metal movement is to
identify bimetallic systems that form surface alloys instead of the
surface and subsurface structures. As predicted in the thermody-
namic stability in Fig. 2, the bimetallic pairs at the far left side
are those that tend to form surface alloys. One of them is the FeNi
alloy, which was selected in the current study for the reforming of
ethylene glycol. Another reason for choosing FeNi alloy was to ex-
plore bimetallic surfaces without precious metals. Fig. 10 shows
the TPD measurements of ethylene glycol reforming on Ni(111)
and on an FeNi alloy produced by annealing monolayer Fe on
Ni(111) at 600 K. The FeNi alloy was active for the production of
H2 and CO. More interestingly, the FeNi alloy remained carbon-
free, as veriﬁed by Auger electron spectroscopy measurements
after the TPD experiments. Additional experiments are underway
to further explore the utilization of Fe/Ni(111) systems as a more
stable and less expensive alternative to Ni/Pt(111) for reforming
reactions.
4. Perspective on challenges and opportunities in bimetallic
catalysis
The examples mentioned in the current paper illustrate the un-
ique catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. In
general, the hydrogenation of C@C and C@O bonds demonstrates
a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported cata-

lysts, showing promise of identifying potentially active catalysts
using ﬁrst principles on model surfaces. The main reason for the
successful correlation is that the desirable bimetallic structures
for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath
the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable in vacuum and
with adsorbed hydrogen, such as in UHV environments and under
hydrogenation reaction conditions.
However, the correlation between model surfaces and sup-
ported catalysts is less clear for the reforming of ethylene glycol,
because the surface compositions and structure of supported
bimetallic catalysts undergo changes under reforming reaction
conditions. Based on the thermodynamic stability of the bimetallic
surfaces [20], it is predicted that many bimetallic catalysts would
undergo similar structural transformation with adsorbed surface
oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Therefore, care must be taken when
correlating model surfaces with supported catalysts for reactions
involving surface adsorbates containing oxygen, nitrogen and sul-
fur, such as reforming, oxidation, and hydrotreating reactions.
One critical challenge in correlating bimetallic surfaces with
supported catalysts is to characterize catalyst structures under
in situ reaction conditions. As illustrated in Table 1, the PtANi
bimetallic catalysts undergo structural changes during APR of eth-
ylene glycol. It is therefore critical to identify the atomic arrange-
ment of bimetallic catalysts under temperatures, pressures, and
reaction media (vapor phase or aqueous phase) relevant to cata-
lytic reactions. One of the most promising in situ techniques is EX-
AFS, which allows measurements of the coordination numbers of
monometallic and bimetallic bonds under reaction conditions. An-
other emerging technique is environmental TEM, with tempera-
tures and pressure of the in situ cell approaching those relevant
to catalytic conditions. These techniques should provide important
information on the bimetallic structures and their stability under
reaction conditions, which would in turn provide critical input
for constructing relevant model surfaces in DFT calculations and
UHV experiments. In order to truly achieve the design of bimetallic
catalysts from ﬁrst principles, it is essential that the bimetallic
structures and compositions of model surfaces are as close as pos-
sible to those under reaction conditions.
From the point of view of model surfaces, at present, almost all
UHV experiments and DFT calculations of bimetallic surfaces are
performed on the closed-packed or low-Miller-index single-crystal
substrates. These results have clearly demonstrated the proof of
principle in directly correlating DFT predictions and experimental
veriﬁcation to achieve a fundamental understanding of the elec-
tronic, structural, and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces.
However, more experimental and theoretical studies of bimetallic
surfaces prepared on high-Miller-index single-crystal substrates
with steps, and on polycrystalline ﬁlms, are needed to understand
the role of surface defects in bimetallic catalysis. Furthermore, sys-
tematic UHV characterization and DFT calculations of bimetallic
nanoparticles with controlled sizes and shapes, in particular on
well-characterized oxide ﬁlms, are needed to understand catalytic
sites and support effects that are more relevant in supported
catalysts.
From the point of view of supported catalysts, it is important to
explore the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts with enhanced struc-
tural stability. As demonstrated in the example of ethylene glycol
reforming on supported NiAPt catalysts, the prevention of metal
segregation and diffusion is a challenge under reaction conditions.
Although the synthesis of well-deﬁned core–shell bimetallic cata-
lysts has been demonstrated for PtA3d bimetallic electrocatalysts
[6], it is unlikely that such bimetallic structures, in particular the
maintenance of Pt or 3d metals as the surface atoms, would survive
the relatively harsh conditions of calcination and reduction in typ-
ical heterogeneous catalysis. One possibility to prevent the metal
movement is to increase the activation barriers of segregation/dif-
fusion by anchoring one or both metal atoms to the catalyst sup-
ports,
although
the
strong
metal–support
interaction
might
modify the electronic and catalytic properties of the bimetallic cat-
alysts. Recent surface science studies have shown that metal car-
bides (WC, W2C, Mo2C, etc.) can potentially replace the precious
metals in bimetallic catalysts [48,49] and at the same time serve
as an effective diffusion barrier layer to potentially prevent the in-
ward diffusion of the surface metal into the bulk. Synthesis efforts
to extend these model surfaces to powder catalysts should lead to
the production of alternative bimetallic catalysts with potentially
higher stability and lower cost.
