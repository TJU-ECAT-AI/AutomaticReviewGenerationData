 in  a high-throughput
 kinetic  test  setup  at
temperatures
 varying
 from
 448  to  498  K,
 with  the  total  pressure
 ranging

feed
 containing
 CO,  C2H4 and  H2 was  used  with  space
 times
 varying
 from 2.7  kgcat s/molC2H4,in to
149

 Three  catalysts  have  been  investigated,
 i.e.,  5%Rh
 on  Al2O3,
 1%Co  on
 Al2O3 and
0.5%Co–0.5%Rh
 on  Al2O3.  The  main  products
 observed
 were  ethane,
 propanal

 The

 showed
 the  highest

 Moreover
 it was  found
 on  all  investigated

 was  about  15–20 kJ
 mol−1 higher  than  that  for hydroformylation.
 On  the  Rh  catalyst,
higher

 Introduction
The
 ever
 increasing
 crude
 oil
 price
 has
 led
 to
 the
 exploration
of
 alternative
 feeds
 such
 as
 natural
 gas
 and,
 correspondingly,
 new
processes
 for
 the
 production
 of
 hydrocarbon
 chemicals.
 Hydro-
formylation,
 or
 oxo
 synthesis,
 that
 was
 discovered
 by
 the
 German
scientist
 Otto
 Roelen
 in
 1938,
 is
 an
 important
 process
 for
 produc-
tion
 of
 aldehydes.
 The
 latter
 may
 play
 a
 key
 role
 in
 the
 upgrading
and/or
 separation
 of
 alkenes
 produced
 via
 alternative
 routes
 such
 as
oxidative
 coupling
 of
 methane
 or
 methanol
 to
 oleﬁns.
 Hydroformy-
lation
 catalysts
 generally
 also
 exhibit
 double
 bound
 hydrogenation
which
 results
 in
 reactant
 alkene
 conversion
 into
 the
 correspond-
ing
 alkane
 as
 well
 as
 product
 aldehyde
 conversion
 into
 alcohols
[1].
 Typical
 hydroformylation
 products
 are
 in
 the
 carbon
 number
range
 from
 3
 to
 19,
 the
 reactant
 alkene
 being
 selected
 based
 on
 the
desired
 product
 aldehyde.
Aldehydes
 are
 useful
 intermediates
 in
 the
 production
 of
 valu-
able
 products
 such
 as
 alcohols,
 carboxylic
 acids,
 amines,
 and
 diols.
More
 recently,
 hydroformylation
 is
 also
 widely
 applied
 in
 the
 ﬁne
chemicals
 and
 pharmaceutical
 industry
 for
 the
 production
 of
 drugs,
vitamins,
 herbicides
 and
 perfumes
 [2,3].
At
 373
 K,
 ethylene
 hydroformylation
 is
 a
 spontaneous,
 exother-
mic
 reaction
 with
 H◦=
 −129.0
 kJ
 mol−1 and
 G◦=
 −56.9
 kJ
 mol−1.

Due
 to
 the
 high
 activation
 energies
 involved,
 the
 reaction
 rate
remains
 rather
 low,
 however
 [4].
In
 principle,
 all
 the
 transition
 metals
 capable
 of
 forming
 car-
bonyls,
 such
 as
 Rh,
 Co,
 Ir,
 Ru,.
 are
 potential
 hydroformylation
catalysts.
 The
 order
 of
 activity
 from
 the
 most
 to
 the
 least
 active
metal,
 is
 as
 follows:
 Rh
 >
 Co
 >
 Ir,
 Ru
 >
 Os
 >
 Pt
 >
 Pd
 >
 Fe
 >
 Ni
 [5]. Cobalt
complexes
 had
 been
 the
 main
 industrial
 hydroformylation
 cata-
lysts
 until
 the
 early
 1970s,
 i.e.,
 prior
 to
 the
 commercialization
 of
rhodium
 based
 catalysts.
 Since
 then,
 cobalt
 catalysts
 for
 hydro-
formylation
 have
 been
 replaced
 in
 almost
 all
 major
 plants
 by
 the
more
 advantageous
 rhodium
 catalysts
 despite
 the
 higher
 price
 of
the
 noble
 metal.
 This
 substitution
 became
 feasible
 because
 the
 high
price
 of
 rhodium
 was
 offset
 by
 cheaper
 equipment,
 increased
 cat-
alyst
 activity,
 and
 a
 generally
 higher
 selectivity
 and
 efﬁciency.
Commercially,
 homogeneous
 Co
 or
 Rh
 complexes
 are
 typically
applied
 at
 temperatures
 ranging
 from
 as
 low
 as
 360
 K
 up
 to
 573
 K
[6,7].
 The
 homogeneous
 character
 of
 industrial
 process
 conﬁgura-
tions
 leads
 to
 inherent
 operational
 problems
 such
 as
 difﬁculties
 in
catalyst
 separation
 from
 products,
 expensive
 metal
 losses
 and
 cor-
rosivity
 of
 catalytic
 solutions.
 The
 successful
 implementation
 of
 an
active
 and
 stable
 heterogeneous
 hydroformylation
 catalyst
 would
allow
 avoiding
 these
 drawbacks.
 Although
 the
 research
 into
 hetero-
geneously
 catalysed
 hydroformylation
 is
 in
 an
 early
 stage,
 a
 wide
range
 of
 research
 activities
 has
 been
 performed
 on
 experimental
heterogeneous
 hydroformylation
 with
 various
 reactants,
 catalysts
and
 operation
 conditions
 [8–17].
Reaction
 mechanism
 elucidation
 is
 an
 important
 subject
 in
the
 reported
 heterogeneous
 hydroformylation
 studies.

 [18].
referenced
 hydroformylation
 reaction
 mechanism
 was
 that
 pro-
posed
 by
 Wilkinson
 and
 his
 co-authors
 [18].
 In
 essence,
 this
mechanism
 comprises
 8
 elementary
 steps,
 see
 Fig.

 i.e.,
 1:
 carbon
monoxide
 desorption,
 2:
 alkene

(towards
 a

 alkyl),
 4:

The
 present
 work
 concentrates
 on
 heterogeneous
 ethylene
hydroformylation
 on
 a
 series
 of
 Rh
 and
 Co
 based
 catalysts.
 Gas
phase
 experimentation
 was
 performed
 in
 a
 high-throughput
 kinet-
ics
 setup
 to
 compare
 the
 Rh
 and
 Co
 catalysts
 and
 to
 investigate
 the
effect
 of
 the
 operation
 conditions
 on
 the
 main
 and
 by
 product
 for-
mation
 rates
 on
 these
 catalysts.
 We  aim
 at
 a
 fundamental
 analysis
both
 in
 terms
 of
 operating
 conditions
 as
 well
 as
 in
 terms
 of
 cata-
lyst
 properties
 and
 how
 they
 could
 be
 potentially
 enhanced.
 Even
 if
the
 catalysts
 investigated
 give
 only
 moderate
 oxygenate
 yields,
 the
mechanistic
 investigation
 provides
 key
 insight
 into
 the
 correspond-
ing
 reaction
 mechanism
 that
 may
 be
 exploited
 in
 further
 catalyst
design.

 Experimental
2.1.
 Catalysts
 preparation
In
 order
 to
 provide
 a
 good
 comparison
 of
 the
 Co
 and
 Rh
 cata-
lysts
 which
 are
 used
 most
 frequently
 in
 industrial
 homogeneous
hydroformylation,
 5%Rh
 deposited
 on
 Al2O3,
 1%Co
 deposited
 on
Al2O3 and
 0.5%Rh–0.5%Co
 deposited
 on
 Al2O3 catalysts,
 provided
by
 Johnson
 Matthey,
 have
 been
 investigated
 in
 this
 work.
 They
 were
received
 as
 powders,
 pressed
 into
 ﬂakes
 and
 subsequently
 crushed
and
 sieved
 to
 retain
 a
 fraction
 with
 a
 diameter
 between
 0.3
 and
0.5
 mm.
 The
 catalysts
 were
 reduced
 in
 situ
 at
 673
 K
 in
 order
 to
convert
 them
 into
 their
 active
 form.
2.2.
 Catalyst
 characterisation
The
 total
 surface
 area
 (BET)
 of
 each
 catalyst
 was
 measured
 using
a
 Micromeritics
 Gemini
 equipment.
 The
 crystallinity
 of
 the
 samples
was
 investigated
 via
 X-ray
 diffraction
 (XRD)
 measurements
 with
 a
Siemens
 Diffractometer
 Kristalloﬂex
 D5000,
 Cu
 K
 radiation,
 in
 the
2
 range
 4–90◦step.
The
 metal
 loading
 and
 corresponding
 particle
 size
 were
 too
 low
for
 retrieving
 useful
 information
 from
 temperature
 programme
reduction
 (TPR),
 temperature
 programmed
 desorption
 (TPD)
 nor
from
 X-ray
 diffraction
 (XRD)
 measurements.
 As
 a
 result,
 transmis-
sion
 electron
 microscopy
 (TEM)
 was
 performed
 to
 determine
 metal
particle
 sizes
 and
 achieve
 information
 about
 the
 distribution
 and
conﬁguration
 of
 these
 metal
 particles
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 three
investigated
 catalysts.
 TEM
 samples
 were
 prepared
 by
 applying
simple
 immersion
 of
 a
 carbon-support
 ﬁlm
 on
 a
 nickel
 grid
 into
the
 catalyst
 powder.
 The
 excess
 powder
 was
 shaken
 off
 carefully
afterwards.
 Catalyst
 particles
 that
 had
 adhered
 to
 the
 carbon
 ﬁlm
were
 investigated
 by
 different
 TEM
 modes:
 conventional
 and
 high
resolution
 (HR)
 TEM,
 electron
 diffraction,
 STEM,
 EDX
 and
 electron
energy
 loss
 spectroscopy
 (EELS).
 A
 JEOL,
 JEM2200FS-Cs-corrected
microscope
 was
 used.
 This
 microscope
 was
 operated
 at
 200
 kV
and
 equipped
 with
 Schottky-type
 FEG,
 EDX
 JEOL
 JED-2300D
 and
JEOL
 in-column
 omega
 ﬁlter.
 Secondary
 X-ray
 ﬂuorescence
 from
the
 analytical
 sample
 holder
 was
 eliminated
 by
 means
 of
 a
 beryl-
lium
 retainer.
 However,
 Ni-peaks
 were
 detected
 in
 the
 EDX
 spectra
due
 to
 secondary
 ﬂuorescence
 from
 the
 Ni
 support
 grid.
 EEL
 spec-
tra
 were
 obtained
 in
 STEM
 spot
 mode
 using
 an
 electron
 probe
 of
1.0
 nm
 and
 objective
 aperture
 angular
 size
 of
 6
 mrad.
2.3.
 Intrinsic
 kinetics
 measurements
Gas
 phase
 hydroformylation
 measurements
 have
 been
 per-
formed
 in
 a
 high-throughput
 kinetics
 test
 setup,
 see
 Fig.
 2.
 This
setup,
 which
 was
 constructed
 by
 Zeton
 B.V.,
 consists
 essentially
of
 three
 separate
 sections:
 a
 feed
 section,
 a
 reactor
 section
 and
 an
analysis
 section.
 The
 setup
 consists
 of
 eight
 parallel
 reactors
 that
 are
positioned
 per
 pair
 in
 a
 split
 type
 bronze
 furnace,
 i.e.,
 reactor
 tem-
perature
 and
 pressure
 are
 controlled
 per
 reactor
 pair.
 Each
 reactor
has
 three
 gas
 feed
 lines
 and
 one
 liquid
 feed
 line.
 Each
 of
 these
 lines
has
 an
 individual
 mass
 ﬂow
 controller.
 The
 reactor
 tubes
 are
 made
of
 AISI
 316
 cold
 worked
 steel
 with
 890
 mm
 height
 and
 11
 mm
 inter-
nal
 diameter
 and
 are
 capable
 of
 operating
 up
 to
 600 ◦C
 and
 15
 MPa,
i.e.,
 far
 beyond
 the
 operating
 range
 as
 required
 for
 hydroformy-
lation.
 A
 three-zone
 reactor
 temperature
 control
 is
 established
 by
electrical
 heating
 within
 the
 bronze
 furnace,
 the
 catalyst
 being
 sit-
uated
 at
 the
 bottom
 of
 the
 second
 zone
 and
 the
 top
 of
 third
 zone.
The
 reactants
 were
 mixed
 before
 entering
 the
 reactor
 from
 the
 top
in
 the
 central
 axis.
 The
 pressure
 in
 the
 reactor
 was
 generated
 by
means
 of
 back
 pressure.
 The
 operation
 of
 the
 setup
 was
 controlled
by
 means
 of
 Labview
 software.
Between
 1
 and
 10
 g
 of
 pelletised
 catalyst
 was
 diluted
 with
 an
identical
 mass
 of
 inert
 material
 prior
 to
 loading
 into
 the
 reactor

 and

 on

Online

 was
 performed
 with
 a
 four
 channel
Agilent
 3000
 micro
 gas
 chromatograph
 equipped
 with
 thermal
 con-
ductivity
 detectors
 (TCDs).
 Hydrogen,
 and
 carbon
 monoxide
 were
analysed
 on
 a
 molar

 5A
 PLOT
 column
 of
 10
 m
 length
 and
0.32
 inner

 with
 a

 of

 m,
 while
 ethyl-
ene
 and
 ethane
 are
 detected
 on
 a
 PLOT

 column
 of
 8
 m
 length
and
 0.32

 with
 a
 ﬁlm

 of

 Heavy

 can
 be
 detected
 in
 an

 and

 with
 a
 ﬁlm
 thickness
 of

Propanal,
 propanol
 and
 other
 oxygenates
 are
 only
 detected
 on
 the
OV-1
 column
 of
 10
 m
 length
 and
 0.15
 mm
 inner
 diameter
 with
 a
ﬁlm
 thickness
 of
 2
 m.
 Argon
 was
 added
 as
 an
 internal
 standard
for
 the
 purpose
 of
 mass
 balance
 veriﬁcation.
 The
 maximum
 error
of
 mass
 balance
 was
 less
 than
 10%
 while
 most
 of
 the
 error
 values
were
 below
 5%.
 The
 elemental
 balances
 were
 also
 veriﬁed
 and
 the
deviations
 were
 in
 line
 with
 those
 on
 the
 total
 mass
 balance.
 The
conversions
 and
 product
 molar
 ﬂow
 rates
 were
 calculated
 using
calibration
 factors
 as
 reported
 by
 Dietz
 [19].
Long-term
 catalyst
 stability
 was
 assessed
 by
 repeating
 a
 refer-
ence
 experiment
 at
 regular
 time
 intervals,
 i.e.,
 one
 every
 few
 days.
Typically
 the
 catalyst
 activity
 could
 be
 maintained
 for
 3–4
 weeks,
after
 which
 the
 catalyst
 was
 replaced
 by
 a
 fresh
 sample.
 The
 selec-
tivity
 towards
 a
 product
 P,
 Sp,
 was
 deﬁned
 as
 the
 number
 of
 moles
transformed
 into
 that
 product,
 Fp,
 compared
 to
 the
 total
 number
 of
ethylene
 moles
 converted:
Sp =
Fp
FC2H4,0 −
 FC2H4
(1)
In
 order
 to
 compare
 the
 performance
 of
 the
 mentioned
 cata-
lysts
 under
 identical
 experimental
 conditions
 the
 conversions
 were
reported
 versus
 the
 so-called
 site
 time,
 which
 is
 obtained
 from
 the
space
 time
 by
 accounting
 for
 the
 metal
 loading
 and
 the
 fraction
 of
exposed
 metal
 atoms,
 as
 well
 as
 for
 atomic
 mass.

The

 from
 the

 as

 and

 [20].

It
 was
 veriﬁed
 by
 using
 the
 proper
 correlations,
 that
 at
 the
selected
 operating
 conditions
 so-called
 intrinsic
 kinetics
 are
 mea-
sured,
 i.e.,
 the
 observations
 are
 not
 affected
 by
 mass
 or
 heat

 limitations
 [21].
 Of
 course,
 upon
 extrapolation
 towards
 the
industrial
 scale,
 potential
 mass
 and
 heat
 transport
 effects
 must
 be
accounted
 for.

 Heterogeneous
 ethylene
 hydroformylation
 reaction
network
The
 most
 generally
 reported
 products
 for
 ethylene
 hydro-
formylation,
 in
 descending
 order
 of
 importance,
 are
 ethane,
propanal,
 propanol
 and
 small
 amount
 of
 C3+ hydrocarbon
 prod-
ucts
 [7,10,12,13,16,22].
 According
 to
 Henrici-Olivé
 and
 Olivé
 [23]
the
 key
 difference
 between
 the
 homogeneous
 and
 the
 heteroge-
neous
 reactions
 is
 the
 presence
 of
 a
 free,
 mobile
 and
 very
 reactive
hydrido-metal
 species
 in
 solution.
 They
 reported
 that
 the
 transfor-
mation
 of
 the
 acyl-metal
 species
 to
 the
 aldehyde,
 see
 steps
 6
 and
 7
in
 Fig.
 1,
 proceeds
 through
 reaction
 with
 a
 second
 catalyst
 species
in
 homogeneous
 media
 while
 in
 heterogeneous
 media
 the
 oxida-
tive
 addition
 of
 molecular
 hydrogen
 to
 an
 acyl-metal
 species
 is
 the
only
 way
 for
 aldehyde
 formation
 [7,23].
It
 is
 accepted
 today
 that
 Wilkinson’s
 mechanism
 is
 the
 most
likely
 one
 in
 hydroformylation
 [3,22,24].
 In
 this
 mechanism,
 it
 is
assumed
 that
 carbon
 monoxide
 does
 not
 dissociate
 on
 the
 catalyst
surface.
 The
 absence
 of
 a
 CO
 dissociation
 step
 in
 ethylene
 hydro-
formylation
 on
 silica
 supported
 rhodium
 catalysts
 is
 also
 reported
by
 Hanaoka
 et
 al.
 [14].
 These
 authors
 observed
 that
 the
 CO
 inser-
tion
 to
 an
 alkyl
 species
 to
 form
 an
 acyl
 species
 is
 the
 key
 step
 for
hydroformylation
 that
 controls
 the
 selectivity
 towards
 oxygenated
products.
Considering
 the
 above
 discussion,
 a
 reaction
 mechanism
 for
ethylene
 heterogeneous
 hydroformylation
 is
 proposed
 in
 what
 fol-
lows,
 see
 Fig.
 3.
 It
 includes
 two
 parallel
 reaction
 pathways,
 starting
from
 a
 metal
 bound
 alkyl
 that
 is
 obtained
 after
 ethylene
 chemisorp-
tion
 on
 the
 metal
 surface.
 The
 ﬁrst,
 and
 in
 hydroformylation
 desired
pathway,
 involves
 CO
 insertion
 and
 leads
 to
 aldehyde
 or
 alcohol
formation.
 The
 second
 of
 the
 parallel
 pathways
 is
 ethylene
 hydro-
genation
 into
 ethane.
 In
 this
 mechanism,
 the
 same
 hydrogen
 and
ethylene
 surface
 species
 are
 involved
 in
 the
 formation
 of
 both
ethane
 and
 propanal.
The
 potential
 presence
 of
 propene
 and
 higher
 carbon
 number
alkenes,
 alkanes,
 aldehydes
 and
 alcohols
 can
 be
 explained
 by
 CO
bond
 dissociation
 in
 the
 produced
 aldehydes
 or
 by
 CO
 bond
 dis-
sociation
 and
 subsequent
 C
 hydrogenation
 to
 methylene
 prior
 to
insertion
 in
 a
 metal
 alkyl
 species,
 as
 it
 may
 occur
 in
 Fischer–Tropsch
synthesis
 [25–27].
 Not
 only
 historically,
 but
 also
 mechanistically,
heterogeneously
 catalysed
 hydroformylation
 is
 very
 closely
 related
to
 Fischer–Tropsch
 synthesis.
 In
 fact,
 the
 reaction
 of
 ethylene
 with
syngas
 has
 already
 been
 used
 as
 a
 probe
 reaction
 to
 study
 the
 activ-
ity
 and
 selectivity
 in
 the
 Fischer–Tropsch
 process
 on
 supported
transition
 metals
 [9].
Because
 this
 comprehensive
 mechanism
 allows
 describing
 the
formation
 of
 all
 hydroformylation
 products
 observed
 in
 this
 work,
i.e.,
 aldehydes
 and
 alcohols,
 as
 well
 as
 ethane,
 it
 is
 further
 used
 in
the
 assessment
 of
 the
 kinetic
 data.

 BET
 Surface
 area
The
 BET
 surface
 areas
 for
 the
 investigated
 catalysts
 are
 reported
in
 Table
 2.
 Only
 minor
 differences
 are
 observed
 between
 the
 cata-
lysts
 considered,
 indicating
 that
 the
 Al2O3 support
 is
 governing
 the
observed
 surface
 areas.
 Nevertheless,
 as
 may
 have
 been
 expected,
the
 catalyst
 with
 highest
 metal
 loading
 exhibits
 the
 lowest
 surface
area.

The
 presence
 of
 Rh
 and
 Co
 on
 the
 investigated

was
 conﬁrmed
 ﬁrst
 by
 scanning

 Giv-
ing
 the

 on

 the
 higher
 than
 expected
 site
 time
 conversions
 observed
on
 the
 latter
 catalyst
 are
 attributed
 to
 the
 ﬁnely
 dispersed
 Co.
Indeed,
 particle
 size
 effects,
 also
 denoted
 as
 structure
 sensitivity,
have
 already
 been
 reported
 in
 hydroformylation
 [8,14]
 as
 well
 as
in
 Fischer–Tropsch
 synthesis
 [28].
The
 product
 distribution
 on
 these
 catalysts
 are
 reported
 in
Table
 5.
 The
 5%Rh
 on
 Al2O3 catalyst
 exhibited
 the
 highest
 selec-
tivity
 for
 oxygenates
 among
 these
 catalysts.
 The
 0.5%Rh/0.5%Co
 on
Al2O3 catalyst
 also
 exhibits
 a
 higher
 selectivity
 for
 oxygenated
 com-
pounds
 compared
 to
 the
 Co
 catalyst,
 which
 can,
 again,
 be
 related
 to
the
 differences
 in
 Co
 particle
 size
 on
 the
 catalyst
 surface.
 The
 previ-
ously
 reported
 particle
 size
 effects
 [8,14]
 particularly
 concern
 the
CO
 insertion
 activity
 rather
 than
 the
 hydrogenation
 activity
 and,
hence,
 result
 in
 an
 increase
 of
 the
 oxo-selectivity.
A
 minor
 presence
 of
 methane
 in
 the
 product
 stream
 can
 be
the
 result
 of
 CO
 chemisorption,
 dissociation
 and
 hydrogenation
to
 methane.
 The
 selectivity
 of
 methane
 never
 exceeded
 2%
 in
this
 work.
 Upon
 insertion
 of
 an
 intermediate
 methylene
 species
into
 a
 metal
 alkyl
 species,
 the
 latter
 will
 grow,
 as
 it
 occurs
 in
the
 Fischer–Tropsch
 synthesis
 reaction
 mechanism.
 Of
 course,
 CO
bond
 dissociation
 after
 a
 prior
 insertion
 in
 a
 metal
 alkyl
 species
may
 also
 explain
 the
 formation
 of
 heavier
 hydrocarbons
 [29].
 The
amount
 of
 methane
 and
 C3+ hydrocarbon
 products
 on
 the
 tested
catalysts
 barely
 exceeded
 5%,
 which
 is
 sufﬁciently
 low
 to
 assume
that
 practically
 all
 of
 the
 converted
 CO
 ended
 up
 in
 hydroformy-
lation
 products,
 i.e.,
 propanal
 or
 propanol.

 can
 appro-
priately
 describe
 the
 reaction.
4.2.1.
 Temperature
 effect
The
 temperature
 and
 pressure
 effect
 on
 the
 hydroformylation
rate
 were
 investigated
 on
 the
 5%Rh
 on
 Al2O3 and
 1%Co
 on
 Al2O3
catalysts.
 The
 temperature
 effect
 on
 CO
 and
 C2H4 conversion
 and,
hence,
 the
 ethylene
 hydroformylation
 and
 hydrogenation
 rates
 on
the
 Rh
 and
 Co
 catalyst
 at
 a
 ﬁxed
 pressure
 of
 2
 MPa
 is
 presented
 in
Fig.
 6.
The
 correspondingly
 calculated
 site
 time
 conversions
 are
 rep-
resented
 in
 Fig.
 7
 as
 a
 function
 of
 the
 inverse
 of
 the
 temperature.
A
 temperature
 increase
 leads
 to
 a
 more
 pronounced
 increase
 of
the
 C2H4 site
 time
 conversion
 than
 of
 the
 CO
 site
 time
 conversion
on
 both
 tested
 catalysts.
 Correspondingly,
 the
 apparent
 activation
energy
 for
 ethane
 formation
 as
 determined
 from
 the
 Arrhenius
diagram
 presented
 in
 Fig.
 7
 exceeds
 that
 for
 propanal
 formation
on
 both
 tested
 catalysts
 by
 15–20
 kJ
 mol−1.
 Hence,
 as
 it
 can
 be
seen
 in
 Fig.
 8,
 a
 temperature
 increase
 has
 a
 negative
 effect
 on
 the
selectivity
 towards
 oxygenated
 compounds
 on
 both
 catalysts.
 For
example
 by
 increasing
 the
 temperature
 from
 448
 K
 to
 498
 K
 on
5%Rh
 on
 Al2O3 at
 2
 MPa,
 the
 oxygenates
 selectivity
 decreased
 from
0.45
 to
 0.26.
 Similar
 observations
 are
 encountered
 in
 the
 literature
[9,12],
 where
 increased
 ethane
 selectivities
 with
 the
 temperature
were
 reported.
 It
 was
 observed
 by
 Balakos
 and
 Chuang
 [9],
 that
in
 heterogeneous
 ethylene
 hydroformylation
 on
 4%Rh/SiO2 with
increasing
 the
 temperature
 from
 483
 K
 to
 573
 K
 the
 hydroformy-
lation
 selectivity,
 deﬁned
 as
 TOFpropanal/TOFC2H6,
 decreased
 from
0.136
 to
 0.039.
 Hence,
 a
 good
 hydroformylation
 catalyst
 should
exhibit
 a
 high
 activity
 at
 lower
 operating
 temperatures
 to
 avoid
a
 too
 signiﬁcant
 loss
 in
 product
 selectivity.
The
 more
 pronounced
 temperature
 effect
 on
 hydrogenation
than
 on
 hydroformylation
 can
 be
 assessed
 using
 the
 previously
discussed
 heterogeneous
 ethylene
 hydroformylation
 mechanism,

 than

 on
 the

 This
 can
 be
 related
 to
 the
 expected
 evo-
lution
 in
 the
 hydrogen
 and
 CO
 surface
 concentrations.
 Because
 the
chemisorption
 heat
 of
 CO
 is
 typically
 about
 the
 double
 of
 that
 of
hydrogen
 [30],
 the
 CO
 concentration
 will
 decrease
 much
 faster
with
 increasing
 temperature
 than
 the
 hydrogen
 concentration.

 in

4.2.2.
 Pressure
 effect
The
 pressure
 effect
 on
 the
 CO
 and
 ethylene
 conversion
 as
 a
function
 of
 the
 site
 time
 at
 473
 on
 the
 Rh
 and
 Co
 catalyst
 is
shown
 in
 Fig.
 9.
 All
 conversions
 and
 consequently
 hydroformyla-
tion
 and
 hydrogenation
 rates
 increase
 with
 the
 total
 pressure
 to
a
 similar
 extent.
 A
 slightly
 more
 pronounced
 enhancement
 of
 the
hydroformylation
 rate
 compared
 to
 the
 hydrogenation
 rate
 may
be
 discerned,
 in
 agreement
 with
 the
 literature
 [13].
 At
 a
 higher
total
 pressure
 also
 the
 surface
 concentrations
 on
 the
 metal
 parti-
cles
 are
 correspondingly
 higher.
 The
 slightly
 increased
 oxygenates
selectivity
 indicates
 that
 in
 particular
 the
 CO
 surface
 concentration
has
 increased.
4.2.3.
 Inlet
 composition
 effect
The
 effect
 of
 variations
 in
 C2H4,
 CO
 and
 H2 inlet
 composition
 on
the
 CO
 and
 C2H4 conversion,
 was
 investigated
 on
 5%Rh
 on
 Al2O3
and
 is
 reported
 in
 Fig.
 10.
 As
 it
 can
 be
 observed
 from
 Fig.
 10a,
the
 CO
 conversion
 and,
 hence,
 the
 hydroformylation
 rate,
 increases
with
 the
 ethylene
 inlet
 concentration.
 Also
 the
 C2H4 conversion
 by
hydrogenation
 is
 enhanced
 by
 increasing
 its
 inlet
 concentration,
see
 Fig.
 10b.
 This
 can
 be
 understood
 when
 C2H4 concentrations
 on
the
 catalyst
 surface
 are
 rather
 low
 and,
 hence,
 when
 an
 increasing
C2H4 surface
 concentration
 has
 a
 negligible
 impact
 on
 the
 other
surface
 concentrations.
 Increasing
 the
 inlet
 H2 concentration

 but
 only
 to

higher
 CO

Increasing
 the

 concentration
 as
 it
 is
 depicted
 in
 Fig.
 10a
and
 b
 has
 a
 considerably
 negative
 effect
 on
 both
 the
 CO
 as
 the
 ethyl-
ene
 conversion.
 This
 can
 be
 understood
 if
 CO
 is
 the
 most
 abundant
surface
 species
 and,
 hence;
 if
 the
 higher
 CO
 surface
 concentration
results
 in
 a
 more
 pronounced
 decrease
 of
 the
 H2 and
 C2H4 concen-
trations
 on
 the
 catalyst
 surface,
 such
 that
 both
 hydroformylation
and

 rates
 decrease.
These
 results
 were
 in
 line
 with
 what

 of

 on
 Al2O3 practically
 exclusively
 resulted
 in
ethane,
 propanal
 and
 propanol
 formation.
 Finely
 dispersed
 Rh
 par-
ticles
 were
 the
 most
 active
 and
 selective
 (up
 to
 45%)
 in
 ethylene
hydroformylation
 to
 propanal
 and
 propanol.
 Structure
 sensitivity
in
 ethylene
 hydroformylation
 has
 been
 explicitly
 observed
 for
 Co
based
 catalysts:
 ﬁner
 Co
 particles
 appear
 to
 be
 more
 active
 and
selective
 than
 larger
 ones.
Irrespective
 of
 the
 investigated
 catalyst,
 the
 temperature
 effect
is
 more
 pronounced
 on
 ethylene
 hydrogenation
 than
 on
 hydro-
formylation.
 The
 15–20
 kJ
 mol−1 higher
 apparent
 activation
 energy
for
 ethane
 than
 for
 propanal
 formation
 is
 a
 result
 of
 the
 higher
 heat
of
 chemisorption
 for
 CO
 than
 for
 hydrogen.
 CO
 was
 found
 to
 be
the
 most
 abundant
 surface
 intermediate,
 resulting
 in
 an
 inhibi-
ting
 effect
 on
 both
 hydroformylation
 and
 hydrogenation.
 Surface
concentrations
 of
 hydrogen
 and
 ethylene
 were
 lower
 and
 did
 not
result
 in
 inhibition
 effects
 within
 the
 investigated
 range
 of
 oper-
ating
 conditions.
 An
 ideal
 catalyst
 for
 ethylene
 hydroformylation
must
 consist
 of
 a
 ﬁnely
 dispersed
 metal
 such
 as
 Rh
 with
 a
 maximum
activity
 at
 temperatures
 below
 483
 K.
