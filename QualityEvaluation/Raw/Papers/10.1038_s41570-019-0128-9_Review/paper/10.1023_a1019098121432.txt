Abstract
The interaction between CO2 and CeO2 and its role in the surface reactivity of alumina-supported cerium oxide has been studied by programmed thermodesorption (TPD) of CO2 and FTIR spectroscopy. The performance of Ce/Al2O3 systems was then analyzed for the propane oxidation in presence of CO2. The results have shown that the catalytic activity decreased when carbonate species are formed at the surface of CeO2. This behavior was attributed to the presence of CO2 from three different sources: contamination before use, during the handling of the samples, contamination proceeding from the reactants and from CO2 produced by the reaction itself.
