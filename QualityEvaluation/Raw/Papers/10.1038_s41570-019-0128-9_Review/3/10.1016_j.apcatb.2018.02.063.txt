Abstract 
The oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to 1,3-butadiene using CO2 as a soft oxidant is 
investigated over oxide-supported NiFe bimetallic catalysts. Dry reforming of n-butane with CO2 
to syngas is also studied under identical conditions for comparison. The Ni1Fe3/CeO2 catalyst is 
identified as a promising catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation to 1,3-butadiene via the C-H 
bond cleavage, while the Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalyst mainly promotes the dry reforming pathway via the 
C-C bond scission. The oxidation states of Ni and Fe are determined by X-ray absorption fine 
structure (XAFS) measurements under reaction conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) 
calculations are performed to further understand the different reaction pathways. Furthermore, the 
effect of oxide supports is studied for the Ni1Fe3 bimetallic catalysts, showing that highly 
reducible supports, CeO2 and CeO2-ZrO2, promote the production of 1,3-butadiene, whereas the 
ZrO2 support significantly suppresses the oxidative dehydrogenation.

1. Introduction 
As an important intermediate for the petrochemical industry1, 2, 1,3-butadiene can be widely 
used to make synthetic rubbers, plastics, resins, automotive fuels and other valuable products.3, 4 
Over the past decade, the on-purpose production of 1,3-butadiene from butanes is developed as a 
promising alternative for its conventional supply from naphtha cracking.4-6 The non-oxidative 
dehydrogenation of n-butane is a highly endothermic process that requires high operating 
temperatures to obtain a sufficient conversion, leading to thermal cracking and catalyst 
deactivation due to coke formation.2, 5, 7 On the other hand, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) 
of n-butane with oxygen is thermodynamically favorable and can be carried out at relatively low 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
temperatures.8-10 However, using oxygen as the oxidant has the issue of deep oxidation, where the 
dehydrogenated products would react rapidly with oxygen to form CO2 and water, significantly 
decreasing the selectivities to 1,3-butadiene and butenes.6, 8, 10 In this context, the use of soft 
oxidants, such as CO2, for the ODH reaction offers an attractive alternative route for the selective 
dehydrogenation of butanes. 
The prime greenhouse gas, CO2, has been reported as a soft oxidant for ODH of light alkanes 
to their respective alkenes.11-13 Using CO2 in a catalytic process to produce valuable chemicals is 
an important strategy to migrate potential problems caused by CO2 emission such as global 
climate change and ocean acidification.14, 15 Compared to ODH with oxygen, the use of CO2 as a 
soft oxidant has the advantages to overcome deep oxidation reactions, consume rather than 
generate greenhouse gases, and reduce explosion risks from the dangerous mixture of oxygen and 
paraffin.11, 12, 16 Furthermore, the unreacted CO2 in excess can reduce coke formation at reaction 
temperatures via the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2 CO), thus increasing the catalyst 
stability.17, 18 In addition to ODH, another important pathway for converting n-butane in the 
presence of CO2 is dry reforming to produce syngas, which can be subsequently transformed to 
value-added products by Fischer-Tropsch or methanol synthesis reactions.1, 19-21  The two 
important reaction pathways for n-butane conversion with CO2, namely the ODH to 1,3-butadiene 
and butenes and the DRB to syngas, are described in the following equations: 
C4H10 + CO2 → C4H8 + CO + H2O                                           (1) 
C4H10 + 2 CO2 → C4H6 + 2 CO + 2 H2O                                       (2) 
C4H10 + 4 CO2 → 8 CO + 5 H2                                              (3) 
 
The ODH of n-butane with CO2 is proposed to occur through a Mars-van-Krevelentype 
(MVK) mechanism, where the catalyst first dehydrogenates n-butane into C4 alkenes and H2, and 
then H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWSR), producing H2O 
as a byproduct.22, 23 Although a large number of mixed metal oxides and supported metal catalysts 
are extensively investigated for the ODH of n-butane with oxygen, very few catalysts have been 
tested for the ODH of n-butane where CO2 is used as an oxidant. Several recent publications 
reported the ODH of n-butane with CO2 over titanium pyrophosphates and vanadium-based 
catalysts, but they mainly focused on the production of butenes instead of 1,3-butadiene.22, 24-26 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Besides, the titanium pyrophosphates and vanadium-based catalysts showed problems of fast 
deactivation and toxicity, respectively.26, 27 Dasireddy et al.28 studied the effect of O2, CO2 and 
N2O on Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst for the ODH of n-butane. However, when CO2 was used as the 
oxidant, the yield of 1,3-butadinene was limited by a low n-butane conversion (< 10%). Therefore, 
it is highly desirable to develop an efficient catalyst with enhanced stability for the ODH of 
n-butane with CO2. In addition, the ODH reaction is supposed to occur simultaneously with the 
DRB reaction in the presence of CO2, thus identifying highly selective catalysts is necessary to 
differentiate the two reaction pathways. 
Previous studies show that Ni-based catalysts are potential options for various reactions 
requiring the activation of hydrocarbons (e.g., hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and dry reforming), 
owing to its availability, low cost and high activity for the cleavage of both C-C and C-H bonds.29 
However, Ni-based catalysts usually suffer from rapid deactivation and show a relatively low 
selectivity toward partial oxidation or reduction reactions. The modification of Ni with Fe is 
considered to be an effective way to tune reaction pathways and also to improve catalytic 
performances in terms of activity, selectivity and/or stability, which is usually dependent on the 
additive amount of Fe.30-32 According to the MVK mechanism, the activation of CO2 is also a 
critical step in improving the overall reaction activity.11 It is generally believed that the activation 
of CO2 occurs at the support or the interfacial sites between the active metal and the oxide 
support.33 Therefore, the reducibility of metal oxide supports is a key factor. Reducible CeO2 
oxide should help accommodate CO2 dissociation by cycling between oxidized Ce4+ and reduced 
Ce3+ states.20, 34 The combination of bimetallic active sites (i.e., Ni and Fe) over highly reducible 
metal oxide supports should increase the catalyst activity, selectivity and coke resistance. 
This work reports the ODH and DRB of n-butane with CO2 over NiFe bimetallic catalysts. 
Reactions were carried out over NiFe bimetallic catalysts with different Ni/Fe ratios as well as Ni 
and Fe monometallic catalysts to identify effective catalysts for both the ODH pathway to 
1,3-buatdiene using CO2 as a soft oxidant and the DRB pathway to syngas. Multiple 
characterization measurements including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption fine structure 
(XAFS), chemisorption and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) were used to reveal the 
structures and properties of supported NiFe catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
calculations were performed to further compare the ODH and DRB pathways. The effect of 
CO2/n-butane ratios on the overall reaction conversion and product distributions was also included. 
Finally, the support effect was investigated on CeO2, ZrO2 and CeO2-ZrO2 to compare catalyst 
activity, selectivity and stability. 
2. Experimental 
2.1 Catalyst preparation 
The supported NiFe bimetallic catalysts were synthesized over three commercial supports 
including CeO2 (35-45 m2/g, nanopowder, Sigma-Aldrich), ZrO2 (80-120 m2/g, Alfa Aesar) and 
CeO2-ZrO2 (60-90 m2/g, nanopowder, Sigma-Aldrich). The incipient wetness co-impregnation 
method was adopted to maximize the NiFe bimetallic bond formation, as described previously.35 
Typically, the required amounts of metal precursors, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Alfa 
Aesar), were dissolved in an amount of distilled water just sufficient to fill the pores of the 
support. The precursor solution was then dropwise added to the support and was mixed 
thoroughly between droplets. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 353 K for 12 h, 
then ramped to 563 K with a heating rate of 0.8 K/min and calcined in air for 2 h. Metal 
loadings of the NiFe bimetallic catalysts were 1.5wt%Ni-0.5wt%Fe and 0.5wt%Ni-1.5wt%Fe, 
corresponding to a Ni:Fe atomic ratio of 3:1 and 1:3, respectively. The as-prepared 
Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni1Fe3/ZrO2 catalysts were mechanically mixed with a weight ratio of 1:1 to 
obtain the physical mixture referred as Ni1Fe3/CeO2+Ni1Fe3/ZrO2 to compare with the 
Ni1Fe3/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst. The Ni4/CeO2 and Fe4/CeO2 monometallic catalysts with a metal 
loading of 2 wt% were also prepared by incipient wetness impregnation to serve as control 
samples to study the synergetic effect between Ni and Fe. 
2.2 Catalyst characterization 
Ex-situ synchrotron XRD measurements of fresh and spent catalysts were performed on the 
17-BM beamline of Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Lab (ANL) with a X-ray 
wavelength of 0.24182 Å.20 The in-situ XAFS spectra of Ni and Fe K-edges were collected at the 
2-2 beamline of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). The detailed procedures 
for sample preparation and data collection have been previously reported.36 For each measurement, 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
50 mg of fresh catalyst (60-80 mesh) was loaded into a glassy-carbon tube (0.3 mm OD) with 
quartz wool packed at both sides of the sample. The sample was first reduced under a 50% H2/He 
flow (10 ml/min) at 723 K for 1 h, and then the spectra were collected with the sample cooled 
down to 373 K in 50% H2/He. Afterwards, the gas flow was switched to a mixture of reactants 
consisting of CO2 (4 ml/min), n-butane (2 ml/min) and He (4 ml/min). Then the sample was 
heated to 873 K with a ramp of 21 K/min. After 85 min of reaction, the sample was cooled down 
to 373 K under the reactant flow to take the XAFS spectra.  
Pulse CO chemisorption was carried out in an Altamira AMI-300-ip instrument to estimate 
the number of metal active sites for the supported catalysts. For each test, approximately 100 mg 
of fresh catalyst was loaded into a U-shaped quartz tube and dried in He (30 ml/min) at 393 K for 
30 min. The sample was reduced in 10% H2/Ar (30 ml/min) with a heating rate of 10 K/min from 
323 K to 723 K and held at 723 K for 45 min. The reduced catalyst was then purged with pure He 
(50 ml/min) at 723 K for 20 min to remove the absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface and cooled 
down to 313 K. Subsequently, pulses of 10% CO in He (590 μL loop) were consecutively injected 
into the He stream until the effluent peak area of the pulses became constant. The amount of CO 
flowing out of the quartz tube was measured with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The CO 
uptake results provided a means to compare the number of metal active sites among the various 
supported catalysts. 
TPR experiments were performed in the same Altamira AMI-300-ip apparatus. For each TPR 
experiment, approximately 50 mg of fresh catalyst, loaded into a U-shaped quartz tube, was first 
pretreated with 10% O2/He (30 ml/min) at 723 K for 1 h and then cooled to 323 K in pure He. The 
flow was then switched to 10% H2/Ar with a constant flow rate of 30 ml/min, and the TPR 
measurement was carried out with a heating rate of 10 K/min to 973 K. The H2 consumption as a 
function of reduction temperature was recorded by TCD, which can be used to compare the 
reducibility of supported metals. 
The temperature programmed oxidation-thermogravimetric analysis (TPO-TGA) technique 
was employed to analyze the carbon deposits on spent catalysts. The TGA analyses were 
performed using a Pyris Series-Diamond TG/DTA instrument with a precision of temperature 
measurement of ± 0.1 K and an accuracy of weight measurement of 0.01%. Approximately 30 mg 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
of the spent catalyst was loaded and pretreated in Ar (30 ml/min) at 473 K for 70 min. The sample 
was weighed again and then heated with a ramp of 10 K/min from 473 K to 1273 K in air (100 
ml/min). The loss of catalyst weight as a function of temperature was recorded to estimate the 
amount of deposited carbon. 
2.3 Flow reactor studies 
Reactions of n-butane and CO2 over supported catalysts were performed in a quartz tube 
reactor (4.0 mm ID) under atmospheric pressure. In a typical experiment, 100 mg of fresh catalyst 
sieved to 40-60 mesh was mixed with 400 mg of acid-purified quartz that was pre-calcined at 1173 
K in air for 2 h and sieved to 40-60 mesh. This mixture of catalyst and inert diluent was loaded 
into the isothermal region of the reactor. The catalyst was in-situ reduced in 50% H2/Ar (40 
ml/min) at 723 K for 1 h prior to reaction. Then n-butane, CO2 and Ar as a diluent were introduced 
into the reactor at a ratio of 1:2:17 with a constant total flow rate of 40 ml/min. For steady-state 
measurements, the reaction system was heated to 873 K and kept at this temperature for over 8 h. 
The gas products were sampled and analyzed online using a gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 B), 
which was equipped with two GC columns (HP-PLOT-Q 30 m × 0.53 mm × 40 μm and 
HP-Mole-sieve 30 m × 0.53 mm × 25 μm, Agilent), a flame ionization detector (FID) and a TCD. 
Control experiments were carried out at 873 K using a blank quartz tube with and without the 
pretreated supports mixed with acid-purified quartz. Both cases showed little activity, indicating 
that the gas-phase reaction, acid-purified quartz and bare supports have negligible effect on the 
reaction. 
The conversions of n-butane and CO2, turnover frequencies (TOF) based on n-butane and 
CO2, and selectivity and yield of products at the steady-state, are defined as follows:

2.4 DFT Calculations 
Spin-polarized DFT37, 38 calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation 
Package (VASP) code.39, 40 Projector augmented wave potentials were used to describe the core 
electrons with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)41, 42 using PW91 functionals.43 The 
Kohn-Sham one-electron wave functions were expanded by using a plane wave basis set with a 
kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV. The Ni(111) surface was modeled using a four layer 5 × 5 surface 
slab. The FeO/Ni(111) interface was modeled by depositing a small Fe6O9 cluster on a three layer 
7 × 7 Ni(111) surface. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point grid in the 
Monkhorst-Pack44 scheme and a Γ-point on Ni(111) and FeO/Ni(111), respectively. A 14 Å thick 
vacuum was added along the direction perpendicular to the surface in the initial slab model to 
avoid the artificial interactions between the slab and its periodic images. During geometry 
optimization, the atoms in the top two layers were allowed to relax while the atoms in the rest 
layers were fixed. Ionic positions were optimized until the Hellman-Feynman force on each ion 
was smaller than 0.02 eV/Å. The binding energy (BE) of an adsorbate is calculated as: 
BE(adsorbate) = E(slab + adsorbate) - E(slab) - E(adsorbate)                       (10) 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
where E(slab + adsorbate), E(slab) and E(adsorbate) are the total energies of slab with adsorbate, 
clean slab and adsorbate species in gas phase, respectively. 
3. Results 
3.1 Thermodynamic analysis 
Thermodynamic analysis for the reactions of n-butane and CO2 was performed using the 
commercial HSC Chemistry 8 software based on the Gibbs free energy minimization algorithm. 
The equilibrium compositions for both the ODH and DRB reactions were calculated from 373 K 
to 1173 K at 1 atm with different inlet feed ratios of CO2/n-butane, providing insights into the 
effects of variables and thermodynamic limitations. As shown in Figure 1, both the ODH and 
DRB reactions are highly endothermic at low temperatures due to the stable nature of reactants. 
Figures 1(a), (d) and (g) display the equilibrium plots for DRB of n-butane to CO, H2 and H2O 
via RWSR. Regardless of the CO2/n-butane feed ratios, the production of H2 and CO starts to 
progressively increase at 473 K and the H2/CO ratio reaches 0.625 at 853 K, consistent with the 
stoichiometric coefficients of DRB as Eq. (3). At temperatures above 853 K, CO2 is completely 
consumed and n-butane conversions are 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 at the CO2/n-butane feed ratios of 1.0, 
2.0 and 4.0, respectively. The equilibrium compositions for the ODH of n-butane to butenes and 
1,3-butadiene along with the CO and H2O byproducts are presented in Figures 1(b), (e) and (h). 
The formation of butenes is observed above 473 K, while 1,3-butadiene is produced at 773 K or 
higher. When CO2 and n-butane are set at a feed ratio of 1:1, butenes are the main products with 
only a small amount of 1,3-butadiene generated at higher temperatures. When CO2 and n-butane 
are set at a feed ratio of 2:1 or 4:1, the equilibrium amount of butenes first increases then 
decreases, while the equilibrium amount of 1,3-butadiene increases progressively to become the 
main product. This trend fits the consecutive reaction pathway for converting n-butane to butenes 
and further to 1,3-butadiene. The CO and H2O byproducts are generated with an equal molar ratio. 
The thermodynamic plots in Figures 1(c), (f) and (i) include the components of n-butane, CO2, 
butenes, 1,3-butadiene, CO, H2 and H2O with the assumption that both the ODH and DRB 
reactions are taking place concurrently. It clearly shows that the DRB pathway is more 
thermodynamically favorable than ODH under the same condition. Therefore, it is critical to 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
identify catalysts that can kinetically promote the ODH pathway. The optimal feed ratio of 
CO2/n-butane for producing 1,3-butadiene is suggested to be 2:1. The reaction temperature for 
evaluating supported catalysts at the steady-state is selected to be 873 K to obtain an appropriate 
activity of gas-phase reaction and also avoid rapid catalyst deactivation by sintering and coking. 
3.2 Catalyst characterization 
3.2.1 XRD 
The XRD patterns of both fresh and spent catalysts are compared in Figure 2 to reveal the 
structural properties of catalysts before and after reaction. As shown in Figure 2(a), the 
characteristic peaks of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 are observed at 4.42 o, 5.11 o, 7.24 o, 8.47 o, 8.85 o and 10.23 o, 
corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222) and (400) planes of the fluorite structure of 
CeO2, respectively.45 For Ni1Fe3/ZrO2, the feature peaks at 3.73 o, 4.36 o, 4.87 o, 5.28 o, 6.26 o and 
8.35 o represent the monoclinic ZrO2, while the peaks at 5.40 o, 7.65 o and 8.94 o correspond to the 
tetragonal ZrO2.46 Broad diffraction peaks of a cubic fluorite phase of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 are identified 
for Ni1Fe3/CeO2-ZrO2, indicating the incorporation of ZrO2 into the CeO2 lattice to form a solid 
solution.47 The XRD pattern of physically mixed Ni1Fe3/CeO2+Ni1Fe3/ZrO2 catalyst appears to be 
an overlap of those of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni1Fe3/ZrO2. For all four Ni1Fe3 catalysts, the crystalline 
structures of their supports (i.e., CeO2, ZrO2 and CeO2-ZrO2) are found to be stable after reaction, 
as shown by the nearly identical XRD patterns of the fresh and spent samples. 
Figure 2(b) shows the XRD patterns in the 2θ range of 5.4 o-7.0 o for the CeO2 supported 
monometallic Ni, Fe and NiFe bimetallic catalysts. For the fresh samples, characteristic peaks of 
Ni oxides are not observed for all three Ni-containing catalysts, while two feature peaks at 5.71 o 
and 6.61 o assigned to the (311) and (400) reflections of α-Fe2O3 are found in the XRD spectra of 
Fe4/CeO2 and Ni1Fe3/CeO2. The spent catalysts exhibit different XRD signatures compared to the 
fresh ones. The spent Ni4/CeO2 has the peak of Ni(111) plane at 6.80 o. For Fe4/CeO2, the two 
characteristic peaks of α-Fe2O3 nearly disappear with the appearance of a new peak at 5.45 o 
corresponding to the (311) plane of Fe3O4, indicating the transformation of Fe species from Fe2O3 
to Fe3O4. For the two NiFe bimetallic catalysts, Ni1Fe3/CeO2 has the characteristic peak of Fe3O4 
at 5.45 o, while Ni3Fe1/CeO2 exhibits the characteristic peak of Fe2O3 at 6.61 o. Both bimetallic 
catalysts have an obvious feature peak at 6.75 o, which is between the Fe2O3 and Ni(111) peaks. 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
This peak is most likely derived from the Ni species, because a gradual shift of the peak position 
to a lower 2θ with a decreasing intensity is observed by comparing the Ni4/CeO2, Ni3Fe1/CeO2 and 
Ni1Fe3/CeO2 catalysts. The shift of this peak to a lower 2θ is probably due to the interaction 
between Ni and Fe. 
3.2.2 CO chemisorption 
In order to obtain a quantitative comparison of the number of metal active sites of different 
supported catalysts, CO uptake values are calculated according to CO chemisorption results with 
the assumption that each CO molecule corresponds to one active site. The results are shown in 
Table 1. Among the CeO2 supported catalysts, the Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 bimetallic 
catalysts have higher CO uptake values than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, suggesting 
that the synergetic effect between Ni and Fe increases the CO binding sites of the catalysts. The 
CO uptake values of the Ni1Fe3 catalysts on different supports follow the trend of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 > 
Ni1Fe3/ZrO2 > Ni1Fe3/CeO2-ZrO2. 
3.2.3 TPR 
Figure 3 shows the H2-TPR profiles of the CeO2 supported NiFe bimetallic and the 
corresponding monometallic catalysts. Two reduction peaks at 500 K and 542 K are observed for 
Ni4/CeO2. The broad reduction peak at 542 K is assigned to the reduction of NiO particles, but the 
cause of appearing the sharp shoulder peak at 500 K remains controversial. Du et al.48 suggested 
that the reduction peak in the low temperature range was probably due to the reduction of weakly 
interactive NiO species with CeO2 supports, while Frusteri et al.49 reported that the peak at 500 K 
was ascribed to the reduction of surface non-stoichiometric Ni3+ species such as NiO(OH). The 
profile of Fe4/CeO2 exhibits two reduction peaks at 596 K and 786 K, which are attributed to the 
reduction of Fe species, i.e., Fe2O3→Fe3O4 and Fe3O4→Fe0, respectively.50 It should be noted that 
if Fe species was totally reduced to Fe0, the reduction peak area for Fe3O4→Fe0 should double that 
for Fe2O3→Fe3O4. However, the two reduction peaks at 596 K and 786 K have similar areas, 
suggesting that the Fe species are not totally reduced to metallic state even after reduction at high 
temperatures. In the case of bimetallic catalysts, the Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalyst presents a very similar 
TPR profile as Ni4/CeO2, with the two reduction peaks slightly shifting to higher temperatures of 
511 K and 569 K, showing that the modification of Ni with Fe leads to a decreased catalyst 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
reducibility. However, the TPR profile of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 exhibits a different trend, as its reduction 
peaks are much lower compared to Fe4/CeO2. 
3.2.4 XAFS 
As an important factor influencing the catalyst performance, the oxidation states of Ni and Fe 
heavily depend on the property of the support as well as the reaction conditions such as the 
reaction temperature and relative concentrations of CO2 and H2. In addition, the reducibility of the 
alkane itself can also affect the redox cycle of Fe species. n-Butane is more reducible than the 
well-studied methane and ethane. For the above reasons, it is worthwhile to confirm the oxidation 
states of Ni and Fe over the CeO2 support under the specific conditions for the reaction of 
n-butane with CO2. Therefore, the local environment of Ni and Fe species is investigated by 
in-situ XAFS analysis at the Ni and Fe K-edges for both Ni3Fe1/CeO2 and Ni1Fe3/CeO2. As shown 
in Figures 4 (a) and (b), Ni species are mainly in the metallic state (0) while Fe species are in 
both metallic and oxidation states for both catalysts. The linear combination fitting results (Table 
2) present that for Ni3Fe1/CeO2, all the Ni species are reduced to Ni(0) while only one third of Fe 
species are reduced to Fe(0) and the rest of the Fe species remain as Fe2O3. For Ni1Fe3/CeO2, over 
90% of Ni species are reduced to Ni(0) while Fe(0), FeO, Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 account for 19.3%, 
7.4%, 28.7% and 44.6% of Fe species, respectively.  
3.3 Catalytic evaluation 
3.3.1 Bimetallic effect 
The CeO2 supported monometallic and bimetallic catalysts were evaluated in the gas-phase 
reactions of n-butane and CO2 under the same conditions to investigate the bimetallic effect. The 
conversions of CO2 and n-butane, and the selectivities to 1,3-butadiene and DRB are plotted as a 
function of time on stream in Figure 5. The average conversions, TOFs and product distributions 
at the steady-state are given in Table 1. Ni4/CeO2 is the most active and selective DRB catalyst, 
which exhibits the highest conversions of n-butane and CO2 with over 96% of the products 
detected to be syngas. When Ni is modified by Fe to form Ni3Fe1/CeO2, the bimetallic catalyst is 
still highly selective toward the DRB pathway with comparable conversions of n-butane and CO2. 
As shown in Figure 5, the conversions of n-butane and CO2 over both of the DRB catalysts 
gradually decrease with increasing reaction time due to catalyst deactivation, but the initial 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
selectivity to DRB (based on CO) is much lower than its steady-state value, as the high catalyst 
activity at the beginning stage can lead to further conversion of CO to methane and also some 
cracking reactions to produce small hydrocarbon molecules (e.g., C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8). 
Both Ni4/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 have an approximately 4:1 ratio of TOF CO2 versus TOF n-C4H10, 
which is consistent with the reaction stoichiometric coefficient of DRB. 
The Fe4/CeO2 monometallic catalyst is much less active than Ni4/CeO2, and the conversions 
of CO2 and n-butane are 10.5% and 7.0%, respectively. However, a promising selectivity toward 
the ODH of n-butane is observed over Fe4/CeO2, where 1,3-butadiene and butenes are generated 
with selectivities of 13.5% and 10.0%, respectively. In addition to ODH, DRB to syngas and 
crackings to C2-C3, especially ethylene, also occur over Fe4/CeO2, accounting for 53.6% and 18.5% 
of the products, respectively. When Fe is modified with Ni to form Ni1Fe3/CeO2, the conversions 
of CO2 and n-butane increase to 18.7% and 11.9%, respectively. Figure 5(d) shows that although 
the selectivity to 1,3-butadiene over Ni1Fe3/CeO2 is relatively low in the early stage of reaction, it 
increases gradually and finally approaches to 21.4% at steady-state. The Ni1Fe3/CeO2 bimetallic 
catalyst is more active than the Fe4/CeO2 monometallic catalyst according to their TOFs. The ratio 
of TOF CO2 versus TOF n-C4H10over Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Fe4/CeO2 is around 3:1, as the DRB and 
ODH reactions of n-butane with CO2 occur simultaneously. 
3.3.2 Support effect 
Support effect on the extent of ODH versus DRB is investigated by comparing Ni1Fe3/CeO2 
with two other supported Ni1Fe3 catalysts, Ni1Fe3/ZrO2 and Ni1Fe3/CeO2-ZrO2. The physically 
mixed catalyst Ni1Fe3/CeO2+Ni1Fe3/ZrO2 is also evaluated for comparison. As shown in Figure 6, 
the conversions of CO2 and n-butane over all four catalysts progressively decrease during the 
reaction owing to different extents of catalyst deactivation. On the other hand, the selectivities to 
1,3-butadiene and DRB gradually increase and decrease with the increasing reaction time, 
respectively. Compared with Ni1Fe3/CeO2, Ni1Fe3/CeO2-ZrO2 appears to be a better catalyst with 
the highest selectivity of 27.4% to 1,3-butadiene at slightly higher conversions of CO2 and 
n-butane. However, when ZrO2 is used as the support, the Ni1Fe3 bimetallic catalyst becomes 
more selective toward dry reforming with a high selectivity over 85% to syngas, and it has a 
higher activity than Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni1Fe3/CeO2-ZrO2. Unlike using the CeO2-ZrO2 solid 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
solution as the support, the catalytic performance of the physically mixed catalyst 
Ni1Fe3/CeO2+Ni1Fe3/ZrO2 is between those of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni1Fe3/ZrO2 without synergetic 
effects. The catalyst activities on the basis of steady-state conversions for the four Ni1Fe3 catalysts 
follow the trend of Ni1Fe3/ZrO2 > Ni1Fe3/CeO2+Ni1Fe3/ZrO2 > Ni1Fe3/CeO2-ZrO2 > Ni1Fe3/CeO2. 
The ratio of ODH yield (i.e., total yield of 1,3-butadiene and butenes) versus DRB yield decreases 
in the order of Ni1Fe3/CeO2-ZrO2 > Ni1Fe3/CeO2 > Ni1Fe3/CeO2+Ni1Fe3/ZrO2 >> Ni1Fe3/ZrO2. 
The different product distributions of the Ni1Fe3 catalysts on different supports can be related to 
the differences of intrinsic properties of the supports, such as reducibility, oxygen mobility and 
carbon storage capacity, which will be discussed in detail in Section 4. 
3.3.3 Catalyst deactivation 
The studies of catalyst stability are very important for developing an efficient catalyst for the 
reactions of CO2 and n-butane. The curves of the conversions of CO2 and n-butane versus reaction 
time shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6 reveal that almost all the evaluated catalysts exhibit 
deactivation to some extent. For the CeO2 supported catalysts, the stability of the bimetallic 
catalysts is enhanced compared to the corresponding monometallic catalysts. However, serious 
deactivation is observed over Ni1Fe3/ZrO2. The Ni1Fe3/CeO2 catalyst is more stable than the other 
catalysts, probably owing to the good carbon elimination ability of the CeO2 support. Generally, 
catalyst deactivation is a complex phenomenon that has been attributed to the sintering or 
agglomeration of supported metals and the formation of coke. The comparison of XRD patterns 
between the spent and fresh catalysts in Section 3.1 indicates that there is no serious 
agglomeration of supported metals. Thus the catalyst deactivation is likely resulting from the 
formation of coke during the reaction. 
The type and quantity of carbon deposits on the spent Ni1Fe3/CeO2, Ni3Fe1/CeO2, 
Ni1Fe3/ZrO2 and Ni1Fe3/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts are further analyzed by their TGA and derivative 
thermogravimetric (DTG) plots. Generally, the carbon species with a lower DTG peak temperature 
has a higher activity and can be easily removed and the peak area represents the amount of the 
corresponding carbon species. Figure 7 shows that little carbon deposit is formed over 
Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni1Fe3/CeO2-ZrO2. However, when ZrO2 is used as the support, a total carbon 
deposit of 5 wt% is observed, and two types of carbon deposits with nearly equal mass fraction 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
can be identified by the two distinct peaks at 553 K and 643 K in the DTG plot of Ni1Fe3/ZrO2. 
Compared with the Ni1Fe3 catalysts, the Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalyst is much less stable with a total 
carbon deposit of 10 wt%. Based on the DTG data shown in Figure 7(b), there are three types of 
carbon deposits at 470 K, 553 K and 850 K with a mass fraction of 11.9%, 87.2% and 3.6%, 
respectively. The TGA analysis is consistent with the catalytic evaluation results. It is important to 
note that all the carbon deposits can be removed at the reaction temperature, i.e., 873 K, indicating 
an easy in-situ regeneration of the spent catalysts. 
3.3.4 Effect of feed ratio of CO2/n-butane 
According to the thermodynamic analysis in Section 3.1, the ratio of ODH versus DRB as 
well as the product distribution of ODH reaction is predicted to be influenced by the feed ratio of 
CO2/n-butane. Therefore, both ODH and DRB catalysts were evaluated using different inlet feed 
ratios of CO2/n-butane. Ni3Fe1/CeO2 and Ni1Fe3/CeO2 were selected to be the representative of 
DRB and ODH catalysts, respectively, because both of them are CeO2 supported Ni-Fe bimetallic 
catalysts and their only difference is the Ni/Fe ratio. As shown in Figure 8(a), the conversion of 
n-butane over Ni1Fe3/CeO2 gradually increases with an increasing inlet feed ratio of CO2/n-butane. 
When the CO2/n-butane ratio goes up to 4.0, the conversion of n-butane nearly doubles that at the 
ratio of 1.0. For the Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalyst, the inlet feed ratio of CO2/n-butane shows a more 
significant effect on the conversion of n-butane, which increases from 30.9% to 70.9% when the 
CO2/n-butane ratio increases from 2.0 to 4.0. Figure 8(b) shows the correlation curves of product 
selectivities with the inlet feed ratio of CO2/n-butane. With an increasing CO2/n-butane ratio, the 
selectivity to 1-butene and syngas linearly decreases and increases, respectively, while the 
selectivity to 1,3-butadiene first slightly increases and then decreases over Ni1Fe3/CeO2. This 
experimental trend is consistent with the thermodynamic results that the extent of ODH versus 
DRB decreases by increasing the CO2/n-butane ratio. For the Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalyst, an increase of 
the CO2/n-butane ratio has very limited effect on the product distribution as CO remains to be the 
main product with a high selectivity over 90%. 
4. Discussion 
In the current study of n-butane with CO2, both the oxidative dehydrogenation and dry 
reforming reactions occur simultaneously, therefore it is very important to identify highly selective 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
catalysts and differentiate the two reaction pathways. The results above demonstrate that reaction 
pathways of n-butane with CO2 are significantly affected by the metal composition and support of 
catalysts. Figure 9 further compares the catalyst activities and product distributions at the 
steady-state for all the studied catalysts, where the results were repeated for three times and 
presented with error bars. As shown in Figure 9(a) and (b), Ni4/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 with Ni as 
the dominating active metal are identified as DRB catalysts with a selectivity of over 90% to 
syngas. For Fe4/CeO2 and Ni1Fe3/CeO2 catalysts with Fe as the dominating active metal, the ODH 
and DRB reactions are occurring with a ratio of 1:2~1:4 and the main product from the ODH of 
n-butane is 1,3-butadiene. The synergetic effect between Ni and Fe can improve the catalyst 
activity, stability and selectivity to ODH products. This finding is in accordance with our previous 
studies on the reaction of CO2 and ethane.35 The metal components (i.e., Ni and Fe) are regarded 
to be responsible for the activation of n-butane, which can control the catalyst activity and tune the 
reaction pathways. Catalyst characterization results including XRD and in-situ XAFS show that 
the Ni species are in metallic state, while the Fe species are in the oxidized states. 
DFT calculations were performed to shed light on the potential reaction pathways for the 
oxidative C-H (ODH) and C-C (DRB) bond cleavages of n-butane on Ni(111) and FeO/Ni(111) 
using the binding energies of the selected reaction intermediates (Table 3). The oxidative C-H 
bond cleavage of n-butane leads to the formation of *CH2CHCHCH2, while the C-C bond 
cleavage of n-butane is investigated for the potential C-C bond scission of oxygenated 
*CH3CH2CH2CO intermediate to form *CH3CH2CH2 + *CO. Figure 10(a) shows that on Ni(111), 
the initial step along the C-C bond cleavage pathway is slightly more favorable than the 
corresponding step along the C-H bond cleavage pathway. This suggests that Ni(111) may 
promote the C-C bond scission of n-butane to produce syngas. In contrast, Figure 10(b) shows 
that on FeO/Ni(111), the initial steps along the C-C and C-H bond scission are almost equal in 
energy, however, the subsequent two steps along the C-H bond cleavage pathway are energetically 
more favorable than those steps along the C-C bond cleavage pathway. Thus, FeO/Ni(111) is 
predicted to promote the C-H bond cleavage of n-butane leading to the formation of 1,3-butadiene. 
In addition to the active metal species, another factor affecting the reaction pathways of 
n-butane with CO2 is the oxide support, as indicated in Figures 9(c) and (d). CeO2 is a highly 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
reducible oxide that can be easily reduced to Ce3+, and the reduced oxide has a strong tendency to 
react with CO2, even causing the direct C-O bond scission.20 For example, for the Ni1Fe3/CeO2 
catalyst, n-butane adsorbed on the supported metal species (i.e., Ni and Fe) is dissociated via the 
cleavage of C-C and/or C-H bonds to form carbon and H species, which migrate to the 
metal-support interface to reduce the CeO2 support and release the CO and H2O products, while 
the lattice oxygen removed by the reaction with carbon or H species keeps being replenished by 
the gas-phase CO2. The CeO2-ZrO2 supported catalyst should adopt a similar mechanism. In 
addition, the enhanced oxygen storage capacity of the CeO2-ZrO2 support should contribute to an 
improved catalyst activity and selectivity to the ODH pathway. In the case of ZrO2 supported 
catalysts, the amount of reducible oxygen species in ZrO2 is reported to be much less than that in 
either CeO2 or CeO2-ZrO2, which might be responsible for the changes in both activity and 
selectivity. Further studies are required to obtain more mechanistic insights into the support effect. 
5. Conclusions 
The catalytic conversion of n-butane with CO2 has been investigated over NiFe bimetallic 
catalysts. Both the ODH and DRB pathways combine the reduction of CO2 and conversion of 
n-butane to useful chemical intermediates. Based on the results and discussion presented above, 
the following conclusions could be made: (1) In terms of activity and selectivity, Ni3Fe1/CeO2 and 
Ni4/CeO2 primarily undergo the DRB pathway with a high activity to produce syngas, while 
Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Fe4/CeO2 show promising selectivity to the ODH of n-butane to 1,3-butadiene 
with a relatively low activity. (2) Catalyst characterizations demonstrate that the Ni active species 
are in the metallic state while Fe mainly exists as FeOx. (3) DFT calculations further compare the 
ODH and DRB pathways over Ni(111) and FeOx/Ni(111) model surfaces, suggesting that Ni(111) 
favors the C-C bond scission while FeOx/Ni(111) may promote the C-H bond cleavage. (4) The 
support effect is observed due to the differences in reducibility and oxygen mobility of supports 
that determine the activation of CO2, where CeO2 and CeO2-ZrO2 promote the ODH pathway and 
ZrO2 only favors the DRB pathway.
