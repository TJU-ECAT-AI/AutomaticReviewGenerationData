Catalytic Dehydrogenation of Propane by Carbon Dioxide: A 
Medium-Temperature Thermochemical Process for Carbon 
Dioxide Utilisation 
X. Du,a B. Yao,b S. Gonzalez-Cortes,a V. L. Kuznetsov,a Hamid AlMegren,c T. Xiao,a* P. P. Edwards,a* 
The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive  catalytic route for  C3H6 production. In studying 
the various possibilities to utilise CO2 to convert hydrocarbons using the sustainable  energy source of  solar thermal 
energy  , thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2  for the process 
operating in the temperature range of 300-500℃. Importantly, the results highlight the enhanced potential of C3H8 
as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10,respectively ). To be utilised in this CO2 utilisation  
reaction The Gibbs Free Energy  (    
 ) of each reaction in the modelled, complete reacting system of the 
dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 also indicate that further cracking of C3H6 will  affect the ultimate 
yield and selectivity of the final products. In a parallel experimental study, catalytic tests of the dehydrogenation of 
C3H8 in the presence of CO2 over 5wt%-Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts operating at 500℃, atmospheric pressure, and for 
various C3H8  partial pressures and various overall GHSV (Gas Hourly Space Velocity) values. The results showed that 
an increase in the  C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising 
enhancement of C3H6 selectivity. This phenomenon can be attributed to competitive adsorption on the catalyst 
between the generated C3H6 and inactivated C3H8, which inhibits any further cracking effect on C3H6 to produce by-
products. As a comparison, the increase of the overall GHSV can also decrease the C3H8 conversion to a  similar 
extent, but the further cracking of C3H6 cannot be limited.  
1. Introduction 
In an attempt to ameliorate the burgeoning growth in 
greenhouse gas emissions, there are currently intense efforts, 
world-wide, aimed at the utilisation of CO2, particularly in its 
conversion to fuels and high-value chemical products1,2,3,4,5,6,7. 
Chemical processes aimed at the  utilisation and conversion of 
CO2 are, of course,  driven in a thermodynamic sense by the 
difference in Gibbs Free Energy between the resulting final chemical 
products, and CO2 and the targeted reactants at the relevant 
experimental conditions.  However CO2 being a highly stable 
molecule will require a substantial amount of energy, effective 
catalysts and effective reaction conditions for any chemical 
conversion processes of CO2 into fuels or high-value chemical  
products.   
Thus probably all chemical reactions for CO2 conversion and 
utilisation are endothermic and will consume considerable amounts 
of energy.  If such energy is provided by fossil fuels, the net effect 
based on any well-to-wheels analysis of the process will invariably 
result in a net production of CO2; this situation could only be 
deemed beneficial from a climate mitigation perspective if the 
necessary input process energy is provided from renewable or 
sustainable sources. 
The motivation behind this work, therefore,  is to identify and 
develop specific chemical utilisation processes for CO2 that can be 
achieved by the application of relatively easily-accessible solar 
thermal energy and associated thermochemical  processes, using 
so-called "Low and Medium Temperature Thermochemical 
Processes", typically operating for temperature ranges of T ~250℃ 
and T ~250-500℃, respectively.8 
Utilising solar thermal energy at these lower temperatures for 
thermochemical 
processes 
than 
the 
widely-utilised 
High 
Temperature Process regime9 (T~1000℃) creates highly interesting 
and important challenges for catalysis science. Coupling and 
optimising the catalyst chemistry of CO2 chemical reactions in the 
temperature/energy range of ca 300-500℃ with the engineering 
challenges of cheap, solar thermal collectors may allow the 
prospect of accessible, sustainable CO2 utilisation.  These coupled 
challenges therefore provide a high level of opportunity for modern 
catalysis science and engineering. 
As an “improved” reaction of the dehydrogenation of C3H8, the 
dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 (         
           ) has been heavily studied over the last 
decade.10,11,12,13,14,15 In this promising reaction, CO2 acts as a mild 
oxidant to combine the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with a reverse

water gas shift (              ), and hence, the 
equilibrium of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 can be shifted to the 
product side. Moreover, CO2 may also reduce the coking effect of 
catalyst by coke gasification (          ). Competitive 
adsorption among C3H8, CO2 and generated gaseous water can also 
explain the relatively lower initial conversion of C3H8, the reduced  
coking effect, and higher stability of catalysts in the CO2 
atmosphere.[16] 
In this paper, the advantages of specifically selecting C3H8 as 
the feedstock for CO2 utilisation are advanced for the  lower 
temperature requirements, as compared to both its lighter and 
heavier alkane homologues, C2H6 and C4H10, respectively. 
Furthermore, in seeking the possibility to convert alkanes with the 
energy source from accessible solar heating technology, the 
temperature range to be targeted  in thermodynamic calculations 
has been localised in the range 300-500℃ which can be easily 
achieved, for example,  by  high pressure steam from a solar 
heating system.  
The shift of the equilibrium state by CO2 in the 
dehydrogenation 
of 
C3H8 
has 
been 
identified 
from 
a 
thermodynamic analysis.17,18,19 However, the reaction systems 
modelled previously  rarely take into consideration the competing 
side reactions and by-products, The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the 
presence of CO2 can be significantly  affected by various competing 
side reactions which are deleterious  to the targeted C3H6 yield, 
selectivity and indeed to the stability of the operating catalyst. 
Hence in this paper, the thermodynamic analysis was operated 
across a more comprehensive reaction system which covered all the 
possible by-products together with the generation of carbon- 
particularly important in a consideration of catalyst operating 
lifetimes  
When considering the side reactions for the dehydrogenation 
of C3H8 in the presence of CO2, the major cause of by-products is 
the further cracking effect on C3H6
20, and the competitive 
adsorption from CO2 is claimed to be an effective way to inhibit that 
process.16 Our analysis reveals that the availability of active sites on 
the catalyst surface does indeed play a critical role in the reaction 
system. To observe the different performance properties of a 
catalyst when reactants are saturated, to the availability of active 
sites, the reactions were operated over a ZrO2-supported Cr2O3 
catalyst with careful control of the various partial pressures of C3H8 
but keeping a constant C3H8/CO2 ratio. The reaction results 
exhibited high C3H6 selectivity by inhibiting the selectivity of by-
products, which is promising result if these processes are to be 
applied in any larger, scale –up industrial process. 
2. Thermodynamics and (selected) chemical 
reactions of carbon dioxide  
In Figure 1 we illustrate the underlying thermodynamic 
considerations for the chemical utilisation of CO2, where the Gibbs 
free energy of formation of CO2 and various related substances are 
shown for comparison. Any attempt at utilising CO2 as a chemical 
reactant must therefore take account of the relative stability (Gibbs 
free energy) of the CO2 utilisation reaction products, as compared 
to CO2 and the other reactant(s) 
Both contributing terms (   and    ) for the Gibbs free 
energy are not favourable in converting CO2 to other molecules. 
The carbon-oxygen bonds are strong and substantial energy is 
needed for their dissociation and subsequent reduction. Similarly, 
the entropy term (   ) typically makes little or no contribution to 
the thermodynamic driving force for any CO2 utilisation reaction. 
The resulting Gibbs free energy of the CO2 chemical utilisation 
reaction,  , provides information as to the ultimate yield of 
reaction products at equilibrium, through the relationship     
  
         . 
From Figure 2, however, the attractive option that that the 
Gibbs free energy changes of CO2 reaction becomes increasingly 
favourable by moving to higher members of the alkane homologous 
series. One notes, of course, that a ready solution for CO2 utilisation 
is its conversion to the more reactive CO via the reverse water gas 
shift reaction (             ), and subsequent use of 
syngas chemistry to yield the desired products. However, this 
attractive route clearly needs a ready source of H2 and ideally a 
source of sustainable H2 derived from non-fossil fuel routes. In the 
absence of hydrogen from low cost, low (zero) carbon sources, this 
process will yield a net CO2 emission for the total wheel-to-wheel 
analysis. 
Our research, then, looks in detail at the thermodynamics of 
the dehydrogenation of C3H8 by CO2 as a potential prospect for CO2 
utilisation in temperature and reaction conditions where the 
ultimate application of solar thermal energy may be a promising 
technology. This is a specific example of the broader challenge 
facing any CO2 utilisation technology ; namely due to the inevitable 
input energy required  to convert CO2 to useful products, reducing  
CO2 emissions through CO2 utilisation will only be possible if the 
energy inputs are from renewable sources. We believe that Low-to 
Medium Temperature Solar Thermochemical processes offer 
considerable opportunities in that regard and the research outlined 
here-setting out the complete thermodynamic analysis together 
with a catalytic chemistry study - may present a way forward for 
CO2 utilisation 
3. Thermodynamic calculations and simulations 
3.1 Methods 
In order to fully understand the thermodynamic basis of the 
dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2, in connecting also 
with the solar thermal technology which is normally set close to 500℃ 
in the form of high pressure steam, the standard change of reaction 
in Gibbs free energy     
 , of the dehydrogenation of C2-C4 alkanes 
with CO2 utilisation (                            
     ) were calculated in the temperature range of 300-500℃. The 
cracking of C1-C4 alkanes and olefins to form carbon (        
 
             ) were also included in these calculations in this 
temperature range to indicate the potential coking ability on 
operating catalysts of each substances. 
Here,     
  of each single reaction in the temperature range of 
300-500℃ was calculated as following: 
      
           ∑

In the functions above,     
  is the standard molar enthalpy of 
formation,   
  is the standard molar entropy, while      is the 
parameters of molar heat capacity at constant pressure. The 
property parameters can be looked up from the chemical 
properties hand books, and these parameters of the related 
substances are list in Table 1 below. 
3.2 Thermodynamic advantages of the dehydrogenation of 
C3H8 in the presence of CO2 
Figure 3 exhibits the standard change of reaction in Gibbs free 
energy (    
 ) of the reactions being compared. In the temperature 
range of 300-500℃, all dehydrogenation reactions show a similar 
trend. The highest     
  is found for the process to dehydrogenate 
C2H6 with CO2 indicating  that it is  much harder to operate this 
reaction as compared to  other low-n alkanes at 300-500℃. 
Importantly, ,     
  does not  keep falling  as the carbon number of 
alkane increases, and to dehydrogenate C3H8 with CO2 appears   
more feasible  than some C4 reactions, for example  
The     
  of alkane and olefin cracking to generate carbon and 
H2 are  shown in Figure 4, The  C4 alkanes  have multiple curves 
because of their constituent isomers. In general, the lower 
                 
  indicates a higher possibility of cracking. Hence, 
the olefins show much higher cracking possibility than any alkanes, 
which imply that the selectivity of target products will be greatly 
affected by further cracking of olefins. For instance, C3H6 will be 
further cracked to lower level hydrocarbons or even carbon, so the 
selectivity will be reduced. It is also obvious that CH4 has the highest 
resistance to coking, and as a sequence of stepwise mechanism of 
hydrocarbon decomposition, it will be a major by-product in these 
reaction systems when looking at olefins only, it is obvious that the 
carbon number is the most important indicator of the cracking 
possibility. With the similar     
  of dehydrogenation of alkane 
with CO2, C3H6 has much higher resistance to cracking than any 
isomers of butene. Although C2H4 has even higher resistance to 
subsequent cracking, it is even more difficult for C2H6 to be 
activated with CO2 when the temperature is kept below 500℃. 
From this analysis, , the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of 
CO2 is recognisably  the best alkane  to be targeted for a chemical 
utilisation process for CO2 operating in this temperature range,-a 
range  specifically chosen for ready-availability of solar heating 
technology for these conditions 
3.3 Modelled calculations of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 
in the presence of CO2 
In reality, of course, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the 
presence of CO2 is not a simple single reaction but a multiple 
reaction system, as shown in Table 2, mainly coupling the 
traditional dehydrogenation of C3H8 (reaction 1) and reverse water 
gas shift (reaction 2). 
In this system, (1) and (2) are the main reactions considered; (3) 
and (4) are further cracking of C3 species where lighter by-products 
are formed; (5) is the reaction to gasify the carbon deposition. 
The     
  of reaction (1), (2), (3) and (5) are shown in Figure 5, 
while the ones of hydrocarbons cracking (reaction 4) are already 
displayed in Figure 4. From 300-500℃, only the cracking of C2 and 
C3, including reaction (3), can reach to a negative value of     
 , 
which means these reactions are thermodynamically favoured. On 
the contrary, the decomposition of CH4 is not favoured in this 
temperature range. Considering C3H8 is the feedstock in this system 
and the stepwise mechanism of hydrocarbons to be decomposed, 
the generation of CH4 can be an important indicator to measure the 
degree, and extent of side reactions during the reaction process. 
CO2, as a mild oxidant, is not favoured to gasify the formed carbon 
deposition. Hence, CO2 is always applied in order to shift the 
equilibrium without increasing the temperature.   It is obvious that 
all other reactions in this system depend strongly on the conversion 
of C3H8 in reaction (1). Thus, when considering only reaction (1), this 
is a decomposition reaction which is favoured under lower partial 
pressure of C3H8. With the equilibrium constants calculated from 
    
  at the temperature range of 300-500℃, the conversions of 
C3H8 under different partial pressure is calculated as shown in 
Figure 6. 
 
     [
     
 
  ] 
The C3H8 conversion is observed to be significantly  affected by 
the partial pressure of C3H8 within the temperature range of 300-
500℃,It is for this reason that the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the 
presence of CO2 should be operated with very low partial pressure 
of C3H8 when designing experiments. 
Apart from the improvement of catalysts, higher C3H6 
selectivity can also be achieved by changing the conditions of 
reaction. A general way to inhibit the reaction extent is to limit the 
contact time of reactants on a catalyst surface by increasing the 
space velocity of gas flow.21 As a comparison we model this and also 
increase the partial pressure of reactants operating under these 
conditions. 
4. Experimental 
4.1 Catalyst preparation 
To prepare the 5wt% of Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst by precipitation 
method, ZrO2 (Alfa-Aesor, 90m2/g, 99%) was pre-heated at 600 for 
6 hour before being grinded and sieved to ＜125μm in particle size. 
Then, Cr(NO3)3-9H2O precursor (99%, Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved 
into distilled water, and this solution was mixed with the 
groundZrO2 support and stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. 
To achieve Cr2O3-ZrO2, the as prepared suspension was dried to 
obtain a slurry or paste, which was finally calcined at 600℃ for 6 
hours in a muffle furnace using a heating ramp of 10 °C/min. The 
solid sample was ground to obtain fine particles ＜125μm. 
4.2 Catalyst Characterisation 
All the samples, including ZrO2 support, were characterized 
with high resolution X-ray Diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical 
X’Pert PRO diffractrometer with CuK radiation (45kV, 40mA). 
When being scanned, samples were flat loaded in the custom-built 
sample holders and scanned from 20°to 30°2θwith a step size 
of 0.0084°and a scanning speed at 0.017778°s-1. 
The amount of carbon deposition on the spent catalyst was 
measured via the thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). The 
instrument employed was a TA Instrument, SDT Q-600, using 
flowing air at 100ml/min from 50℃ to 1000℃ with a ramp rate of 
10℃/min. The TGA curves were also derived as D-TGA to show the 
rate of weight losses of samples

4.3 Catalyst Testing 
The stability test of C3H8 dehydrogenation in the presence of 
CO2 was operated in an M-R-10A micro-reactor (KUNLUN YONGTAI 
Company, China) over the Cr-based catalyst prepared as above. All 
tests were operated under atmospheric pressure and 500℃ for 5 
hours, and the C3H8/CO2 mixture, whose mole ratio was kept at 
C3H8/CO2 =1:2. As shown in Table 3, the conditions of tests differed 
from each other by two variables, the mole fractions of C3H8 (and 
CO2) and overall gas hourly space velocity (GHSV). N2 balance was 
applied to dilute the gas mixture. Considering that the reactions 
were operated under atmospheric pressure, the partial pressure of 
C3H8 in “R-4800x2” and “R-4800x3” was increased, and the GHSV of 
C3H8 was changed to the same level as “R-9600” and “R-14400” 
respectively. 
The composition of outlet gas was tested by an online Gas 
Chromatography (PerkinElmer, Clarus 580 GC), and the conversions 
of C3H8 and CO2, the selectivity of products, and the carbon balance 
in gaseous products can be determined with the following 
equations: 
                   
  
          
     
  
         
                            
                                  
       
  
                 
   
      
  
                                      
                                    
       
      
       
                 
                   
   
      
      
           
                    
 
    
              
              
              
              
          
           
      
       
          
     
     
                     
      
          
      
      
      
     
5. Results and Discussion 
5.1 Catalytic test results 
The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity of the reaction under 
different C3H8 partial pressures and overall GHSV are shown in 
Figure 7. The results reveal effective C3H8 conversions at each 
specified condition while the C3H6 selectivity drops at the beginning 
of reactions. The results with different mole fractions of C3H8 were 
displayed with solid symbols and the conclusion drawn from the 
data in these figures is an inhibition of C3H8 conversion, but also an 
improvement in C3H6 selectivity. However, with the same increase 
of C3H8 fractional GHSV (by increasing the overall GHSV), the C3H8 
conversion was inhibited to a similar extent while the C3H6 
selectivity decreased also. These comparative results indicate that 
even though the C3H8 conversion was similarly inhibited via the two 
routes to increase the C3H8 fractional GHSV, the underpinning 
mechanisms were fundamentally different. 
Figure 8 exhibits the production of CH4, the main by-product. 
The initial selectivity of CH4 was decreased from 6% to 3% as an 
increase of C3H8 fractional GHSV. The CH4 selectivity can roughly 
indicate the cracking capability of catalyst on higher level 
hydrocarbons, which indirectly exhibits the extent of further 
cracking effect on C3H6 during the reaction. 
5.2 Discussion on the changes of C3H6 selectivity. 
The conversion of reactants and the mass balances of carbon 
and oxygen elements are shown in Table 4. In contrast to the high 
stability of the C3H8 conversion, the CO2 conversions dropped 
drastically over the first 5 hours. This may be due to the various and 
different sites for C3H8 and CO2 to be adsorbed on the catalyst 
surface respectively; C3H8 is usually attached to Cr species while CO2 
can be adsorbed at the interface between Cr2O3 dopant and ZrO2 
support.22 The high level of C-Balance indicates the low generation 
of solid and liquid C-containing product,; this confirms the high 
stability of C3H8 conversions in each test. The O-balance, which was 
higher than 100% at the end of the test, indicates additional, 
extraneous  oxygen  must have entered into the gaseous phase 
during the reaction, and the oxygen source can be attributed to the 
reduction of high valance state chromium species (Cr6+/Cr5+) on the 
catalyst surface.23  Weckhuysen et al.24 claimed that Cr6+ plays as a 
precursor for the Cr dehydrogenation centres, and the reduction of 
Cr species is assumed to be one of the primary deactivation 
mechanisms. 
Table 5 is a compilation of the selectivity of gaseous products. 
The reduced level of C2Hx production as compared to that of the 
selectivity of CH4 was observed). This experimental trend matched 
the prediction (highlighted in Figure 4) that CH4 is much more 
difficult to be thermally cracked at 500℃ than corresponding C2 
molecules. The decrease of CO yield was not as much as the trend 
of CO2 conversion; we believe this is due to the carbon gasification 
by reducing the chromium species (Cr6+/Cr5+) on catalyst surface, 
which matches the observed increasing  O-balance. 
The XRD patterns of 5wt%-Cr2O3/ZrO2 before and after the 
catalytic tests are displayed in Figure 9, and the pattern of the ZrO2 
support is also shown here as reference. The peak at 2θ=36.18°is 
corresponds to the 1-1-0 phase of Cr2O3 with rhombohedral crystal 
symmetry. No peak shift or new peaks were observed from the 
post-reaction catalyst, which indicated that no phase change 
occurred during the catalytic test. Importantly, this also matched 
the high stability of C3H8 conversions, as shown in Figure 7.

and 
the 
corresponding derivative weight -to - temperature (D-TGA) plots are 
displayed in Figure 10. The weight loss starting from 200℃ we 
attribute to the combustion of amorphous carbon in air. The 
integrated area of the derivative weight equals to the weight loss, 
which displayed more coke formed with an increase of the C3H8 
fractional GHSV. 
In general terms, the mechanism of C3H8 dehydrogenation in 
the presence of CO2 involves the primary activation of C3H8 on the  
catalyst surface, while CO2 provides a contribution to the reaction 
equilibrium shift by oxidising H2 generated from the C3H8 
dehydrogenation (via the reverse water gas shift reaction, 
             ). From the macro perspective, the average 
contact time for each C3H8 molecule is shortened with the higher 
C3H8 fractional GHSV, and this is the cause of a decreased C3H8 
conversion by optimising both methods to modify the C3H8 
fractional GHSV. However, the observed changes of C3H6 selectivity 
indicate that only increasing the partial pressure of reactants can 
effectively inhibit the further cracking of C3H6. This arises because 
the competitive adsorption between C3H6 and other substances are 
strengthened from the micro perspective

Conclusions 
With the aim of attempting to (ultimately) correlate  the 
dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 with the energy 
source from solar heating technology, thermodynamic calculations 
were operated for chemical processes operating in the temperature 
range 300-500℃. An important outcome is the great potential of 
C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and 
C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and 
also coking resistance across this temperature range. The     
  of 
each reaction in our thermodynamic modelling  of the 
dehydrogenation of C3H8  in the presence of CO2 also indicated that 
neither the reverse water gas shift nor the coke gasification with 
CO2 are favoured at 300-500 
A series of catalytic tests were carried out over 5wt%-
Cr2O3/ZrO2 at various C3H8 partial pressure and overall GHSV. It was 
shown that the increase of C3H8 partial pressure is highly beneficial 
for the enhancement of C3H6 selectivity. Meanwhile, the C3H8 
conversion was sacrificed due to the competitive adsorption 
between the produced C3H6 and inactivated C3H8 molecules, which 
was the major reason for the inhibition of further cracking of C3H6. 
As a comparison, the increase of the overall GHSV can also decrease 
the C3H8 conversion to the similar extent. However, the further 
cracking of C3H6 cannot be limited because only the contacting time 
of C3H8 on the catalyst surface was shortened from this micro 
perspective. 
From the aspect of the ultimate application of this particular 
CO2 utilisation processes, we believe that the enhancement of 
selectivity of the (target) C3H6 product, whilst sacrificing some of 
the reactants’ ultimate conversion is acceptable. The efficiency can 
be improved by a cycle system involving the reuse of the 
unconverted feedstock by separating from the outlet mixture and 
subsequently cycling back to the inlet mixture. It is recognised that 
this kind of cycle system is beneficial to the reactions with low 
conversion but very high selectivity. The high thermo-stability of the 
present catalyst makes it attractive to scale-up to a moving bed or 
even a fluid bed reactor for catalyst regeneration.  
We believe that the results presented here are promising in 
terms of the underpinning catalyst science for establishing the 
potential industrialisation of the process of CO2 utilisation through 
C3H8 dehydrogenation. This type of CO2 utilisation, operating in the 
relatively low temperature range of 300-500 - and easily 
accessible by solar thermochemical routes, could help shift the 
focus of CO2 interest from the disposal of an inconvenient by-
product – typified by the process of Carbon Capture and Storage 
(CCS) - towards the production and use of CO2 as a commodity 
chemical in Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU).  However, one 
must stress again that any proposed CCU process to be realistic for 
emission reduction potential can only be beneficial if any necessary 
energy input is from renewable sources. As noted here, our view is 
that solar thermal chemical processes for CO2 utilisation, accessible 
across these temperature ranges, offer very considerable potential 
in that important regard.
