Dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene in the presence of CO2 was performed over binary
In2O3–Al2O3 mixed oxides prepared by alcoholic coprecipitation. Synergistic effect of different composi-
tion on the catalytic performance has been observed. Characterization by X-ray diffraction and X-ray pho-
toelectron spectroscopy revealed that the combination of the two components can result in signiﬁcant
modiﬁcation in the surface properties and bulk dispersion of the In2O3 phase, which in turn leads to a
higher reducibility of the In–Al–O composite. A correlation between the temperature-programmed
reduction data and the PDH activity for In2O3–Al2O3 revealed that the creation of surface metallic indium
species during the reaction is crucial for the dehydrogenation performance. The promoting effect of CO2
on the yield of propylene has been attributed to a facilitation of simple dehydrogenation by its coupling
with the reverse water gas shift reaction based on the results from temperature-programmed reaction of
CO2 with H2.

1. Introduction
Dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane,
into the corresponding alkenes has attracted signiﬁcant attention
since the alkenes constitute an important and versatile class of
intermediates in the chemical industry [1,2]. At present, propylene
is typically obtained by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane
(PDH) [3,4] and as a by-product of steam cracking or a ﬂuidized
catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha. UOP and AAB Lummus Global,
two of the world leaders of catalytic dehydrogenation technology,
have licensed eight commercial process units [5], which currently
can provide propylene with an aggregate capacity of about 2.1 mil-
lion metric tons per year. Dehydrogenation of propane, however, is
an equilibrium-limited and endothermic reaction [6,7]. For ther-
modynamics reasons, signiﬁcant yield of alkene requires operation
at relatively high temperatures and thus high-energy costs. More-
over, such process conditions favor undesired thermal cracking
reactions to lighter hydrocarbons and notoriously rapid catalyst
deactivation due to coke formation [8,9].
An alternative to this process is the oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH) of propane by molecular oxygen [10,11], which has attracted
increasing attention due to its higher efﬁciency of using light alkane
resource with minimum energy consumption when compared to
the conventional direct dehydrogenation. The ODH gives the follow-
ing beneﬁts: the reaction is irreversible and exothermic; process can
be carried out at lower temperatures without carbon deposition
deactivating the catalyst [12–14]. However, using oxygen as an oxi-
dant brings several problems to the reaction [15], such as ﬂammabil-
ity, necessity of heat removal and deep oxidation, which reduces the
process selectivity due to the production of undesired carbon oxides
[16] and is hard to control. Therefore, it is expected that replacing
oxygen in the ODH reactions by soft oxidants, such as N2O and CO2
[17–20], will suppress these disadvantages.
Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the
use of CO2 as a milder and safer oxidant in the ODH of propane
[6,7,16,20–26]. It is worth noting that the dehydrogenation of pro-
pane in the presence of CO2 can proceed by two different reaction
pathways. The ﬁrst is a direct process, in which CO2 promotes the
dehydrogenation through re-oxidizing the catalyst surface as re-
duced by propane. This one-step pathway is in agreement with
the Mars–Van Krevelen mechanism [16,22,24]. The second one,
known as a two-step pathway, is a simple dehydrogenation fol-
lowed by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction [7,25,26].
In this case, CO2 removes hydrogen from the reaction system and
releases the thermodynamic limitation of equilibrium. Many re-
sults indicate that propylene is formed by both presented mecha-
nisms [20]. Moreover, in the dehydrogenation process, carbon
dioxide can act as a diluent [27], which delivers the required heat
and reduces coking of catalyst by coke gasiﬁcation.
To date, the catalysts suggested for propane dehydrogenation
with CO2 are mainly based on supported (transition) metal oxides

that allow effective hydrocarbon activation at temperatures signif-
icantly lower than conventional dehydrogenation process. Among
all the studied catalysts, supported gallium oxides have recently
been recognized as one of the most promising materials due to
their excellent catalytic efﬁciency as compared to conventional
Cr2O3- or Pt-based systems [7,28–33]. One critical limitation asso-
ciated with the Ga2O3-catalyzed PDH process, however, is the dras-
tic deactivation during a few hours on stream [29,30]. Very
recently, we have demonstrated that Ga2O3–Al2O3 mixed oxides
are highly active and stable catalysts for PDH in the presence of
CO2 [25,26]. The superior performance of the Ga2O3–Al2O3 system
has been attributed to the formation of gallia-alumina solid solu-
tion between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 [26], which allows the favorable cre-
ation of a high abundance of coordinatively unsaturated surface
Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity. However, the development of
new improved catalytic system exhibiting desirable stability and
activity still remains a major challenge.
In continuation of our interest in exploring the applications of
mixed oxides containing group III elements (Al, Ga and In) in
propane dehydrogenation [25,26], herein, we report for the ﬁrst
time the use of In–Al mixed oxide as a new efﬁcient catalyst in
the dehydrogenation of propane to prepare propylene. In2O3–
Al2O3 mixed oxides, previously established as an excellent sys-
tem for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx owing to its
unique low-temperature redox properties [34–38], have shown
to be particularly efﬁcient for PDH in the presence of CO2. Our
results have shown that the creation and maintenance of the
catalytically active metallic indium species in optimal surface
concentration is indispensable for an efﬁcient dehydrogenation
of propane.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A series of mixed In2O3–Al2O3 oxide catalysts with various com-
positions as well as the simple oxide of Al2O3 and In2O3 were pre-
pared through a previously developed alcoholic coprecipitation
pathway [39]. In a typical synthesis, concentrated aqueous ammo-
nia and ethanol (50:50 in volume) was added dropwise to the eth-
anol solution of indium nitrate hydrate (In(NO3)35H2O, Aldrich,
99.99%) and aluminum nitrate hydrate (Al(NO3)39H2O, Fluka,
99.9%) with different In:Al molar ratio until no more precipitation
occurred (pH = 8.5). The resulting gel was quickly ﬁltered and
washed by ethanol, dried at 373 K overnight, and ﬁnally calcined
at 873 K for 6 h. The ﬁnal catalyst is denoted as In–Al-n hereinafter
where n represents the mole percentage of In2O3.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The BET-speciﬁc surface areas of the samples were determined
by adsorption–desorption of nitrogen at liquid nitrogen tempera-
ture, using a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 equipment. The X-ray
powder diffraction (XRD) of the catalysts was carried out on a Bru-
ker D8Advance X-ray diffractometer using nickel-ﬁltered Cu Ka
radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA. The acidic and basic properties of
each catalyst were characterized by temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD) of NH3 and CO2, respectively [26]. In a typical
experiment for TPD studies, about 200 mg of the oven-dried sam-
ple (dried at 383 K overnight) was placed in a U-shaped quartz
sample tube. NH3 (or CO2) was saturated at 413 K after pre-treat-
ment at 773 K in a He stream. The NH3 (or CO2) desorbed was
determined by gas chromatography at temperatures from 413 to
873 K at a ramp rate of 10 K min1 and subsequently maintained
at 873 for 20 min.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were recorded on
a Perkin Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA system with Mg Ka excitation line
(hm = 1253.6 eV). The binding energies (BE) were referenced to the
C 1s peak of contaminant carbon at 284.6 eV with an uncertainty of
±0.2 eV. Elemental analysis was performed using ion-coupled plas-
ma (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy on a Thermo Electron IRIS
Intrepid II XSP spectrometer. Temperature-programmed reduction
(TPR) results were obtained on a homemade apparatus loaded with
20 mg of catalyst. The samples were pretreated in ﬂowing nitrogen
at 773 K for 1 h. After cooled to room temperature, the samples
were subsequently contacted with an H2/Ar mixture (H2/Ar molar
ratio of 5/95 and a total ﬂow of 40 mL min1) and heated at a rate
of 5 K min1, to a ﬁnal temperature of 1073 K. The H2 consumption
was monitored by an on-line thermal conductivity detector. Since
water is produced during reduction, the gas exiting from the reac-
tor was passed through a cold trap before entering the thermal
conductivity detector.
2.3. Activity measurement
Catalytic tests were performed in a ﬁxed-bed ﬂow microreactor
at atmospheric pressure, and the catalyst amount was 200 mg.
Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a ﬂow rate of 10 mL min1.
The catalysts were pretreated at 873 K for 1 h in nitrogen ﬂow, and
the reaction temperature was 873 K. During reaction, the gas reac-
tant contained 2.5 vol% propane, 5–30 vol% CO2, and a balance of
nitrogen. The feed and the reaction products were analyzed using
an on-line gas chromatograph (Type GC-122, Shanghai) equipped
with a 6-m packed column of Porapak Q and a ﬂame ionization
detector (FID). The permanent gas products, including N2, CO,
and CO2, were analyzed on-line by another GC equipped with a
TDX-01 column and a TCD detector. All carbon balances closed
within 92–95%. The conversion and selectivity were calculated as
follows:
C3H8 conversion ¼ C3H8in  C3H8out
C3H8in
 100%
C3H6 selectivity ¼
C3H6out
C3H8in  C3H8out
 100%
2.4. Temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2
A temperature-programmed CO2–H2 test was carried out to
investigate the activity of the In–Al mixed oxide catalysts for the
RWGS reaction. The measurements were performed in a ﬂow mic-
roreactor system. Prior to the experiment, a sample (100 mg) was
outgassed in a ﬂow of pure helium at 873 K for 30 min. Subse-
quently, the microreactor was cooled down to about 443 K. Reac-
tion was performed using CO2/H2/He gas mixture with the ratio
of 1:1:4 and total ﬂow rate of 12 mL min1. The experiment was
carried out with a linear heating rate of 10 K min1 up to the ﬁnal
temperature of 973 K. The reactants and all possible products of
reaction were continuously monitored by the QMS detector (Bal-
zers OmniStar). The signal of the helium line served as the internal
standard to compensate ﬂuctuations of the operating pressure.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterization and acid–base properties
Fig. 1 illustrates the diffractograms obtained for various In2O3–
Al2O3 mixed oxides, along with those for bulk In2O3 and Al2O3 as
references. The as-synthesized alumina was poorly crystallized,
which is a common feature for c-alumina [39], and even poorer
crystalline signals of alumina are observed in the mixed oxide sam-

ples. In contrast, the bulk In2O3 presents a well-crystallized phase.
The peak intensities and their 2h angles (30.6, 35.6, 51.3, and
60.9) have been identiﬁed as characteristic of the cubic structure
of In2O3 (c-In2O3, JCPDS 6-0416). For all mixed oxide samples, ex-
cept in the case of the In–Al-10 sample, the diffraction peaks cor-
responding to c-In2O3 phase are observed. The diffraction peaks
corresponding to crystalline indium oxide phase of all In–Al–O
samples are much weaker and broader than those of bulk In2O3,
pointing to apparently higher component dispersion of the
In2O3–Al2O3 composites with higher aluminum content. However,
the positions of the diffraction lines for the mixed oxide samples
were still the same as for the bulk indium oxide, indicating no Al
substitution with In due to the relatively large difference of the
atomic radii of In (0.79 Å) and Al (0.53 Å) atoms [40]. This fact, tak-
ing together with the signiﬁcantly decreased crystallinities for
Al2O3 and In2O3, suggests that the incorporation of alumina has
not affected the crystalline structure of indium oxide but rendered
better dispersions of both oxides.
Of all the mixed oxides investigated, the In–Al-10 catalyst
shows the highest component dispersion, as reﬂected from the
totally amorphous nature of this sample. This is also expected
as a result of the highest speciﬁc surface area (195 m2 g1, see Ta-
ble 1) of In–Al-10 when compared to other In2O3–Al2O3 samples.
Surface acidity and basicity measurements by NH3- and CO2-TPD
measurements (see Supplementary material, Tables S1 and S2
and Figs. S1 and S2) reveal an abundance of surface basic sites
of medium strength and limited number of weak and medium
strong acid sites in the bulk indium oxide. However, a much high-
er population of acidic sites than that of basic sites can be ob-
served for the In–Al mixed oxide samples. It is worthwhile to
note that the introduction of aluminum signiﬁcantly modiﬁes
the acid–base distribution, increases both the overall acidity and
basicity of indium oxide.
3.2. Redox behaviors and XPS studies
The reducibility of indium species in the In2O3–Al2O3 catalysts
was investigated by TPR experiments. As shown in Fig. 2, the TPR
proﬁle of bulk In2O3 exhibits a single and broad peak centered at
ca. 1000 K, attributable to the characteristic reduction of crystal-
line In2O3 to In0 [34,35]. The hydrogen consumption is calculated
to be 10.3 mmolH2 g1, corresponding to ca. 95% of the complete
reduction of indium oxide. Distinct proﬁle changes are identiﬁed
for the reduction of In–Al mixed oxide samples, where two distinct
reduction features are observed. The main reduction peak (b) as-
cribed to the reduction of crystalline phase In2O3 is shifted to a
lower temperature of ca. 970 K in the In–Al mixed oxides, indica-
tive of the presence of a In/Al interaction which facilitates the
reduction of the dispersed In2O3. Gervasini et al. reported similar
observations in their in-depth study on the nature of supported
In2O3 catalysts for the SCR of NOx and also compared the reduction
of indium on various supports [38]. And it was noted that the dis-
persed InOx species on the support are more reducible than the
bulk In2O3. One can also see that with increasing alumina incorpo-
ration, the fraction of low temperature (LT) reduction peak (a) in
the temperature range of 473–773 K, attributable to the reduction
of dispersed indium oxide phase with smaller particles sizes to
metallic In0 species [34,35,38], is observed to be the highest for
sample In–Al-10 when compared to other In2O3–Al2O3 samples
(Table 1). This observation further conﬁrms the presence of at least
two types of In2O3 phase in the In2O3–Al2O3 samples, where crys-
tallized indium oxide (b peak) and In2O3 phase highly dispersed on
alumina (a peak) co-exist.

XPS experiments make it possible to determine not only the
oxidation state, but also the In/Al ratio in the surface. These results
are summarized in Table 1. In all cases, only one oxidation state
was found, with binding energy for In 3d5/2 between 444.5 and
444.7 eV. These values are characteristic of In2O3 [41]. Considering
that XPS is a surface sensitive technique, the In/Al ratio gives an
idea of the component dispersion. The surface In/Al ratios are in
line with the ICP data (see Table 1), conﬁrming a high component
dispersion of all mixed oxide samples. To gain further insight into
the chemical state of indium species during reduction and the pos-
sible inﬂuence of CO2 exposure upon metallic indium, XPS studies
on In–Al-20 subjected to various atmospheric treatments were car-
ried out (see Fig. 3 and Table 2). In the case of the fresh In–Al-20
sample (Fig. 3a), only bands assigned to In(III) species could be ob-
served. After reduction treatment at 773 K (Fig. 3b), an additional
feature signaling the formation of metallic In0 (B.E. In 3d5/2 =
443.5 eV) species appeared. The In0 accounted for 39.8 (atom%)
of the total indium species based on deconvolution analysis (Table
2). This result agrees well with that (33%, in Table 1) of its likely
precursor (highly dispersed In2O3) as estimated based on TPR re-
sults, implying all the existing In0 derive exclusively from the
highly dispersed In2O3 rather than bulk ones. TEM experiments
have been carried out to observe a possible structure of the metal-
lic In0 particles. However, the identiﬁcation of the small indium
particles was unsuccessful, possibly due to the poor contrast be-
tween In0 and metal oxides in the reduced sample. When this par-
tially reduced sample is further subjected to an exposure of CO2 at
873 K, no spectral variation could be observed (Fig. 3c). This indi-
cates that the preformed metallic In0 cannot be re-oxidized by
CO2 under reaction conditions, possibly due to the relatively weak
oxidant potential of this molecule [16].
3.3. Propane dehydrogenation activity
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over the In-con-
taining materials along with Al2O3 in the absence of CO2 was inves-
tigated at 873 K. The major product formed in the reaction is
propylene, and the minor products are ethane, ethylene, and meth-
ane. The results, shown in Fig. 4, point to a marked composition ef-
fect on the catalytic performance of the In2O3–Al2O3 samples. Both
simple oxides of In2O3 and Al2O3 demonstrated low propane con-
version of <10%, which is fully in line with their inferior dehydro-
genation activities as reported by Nakagawa et al. [21]. It is
apparent moreover that all In-containing samples exhibited a very
low selectivity toward propylene formation in the initial stage of
the reaction, suggesting that an induction period is required to de-
velop the active site. It is of interest to note that this performance
evolution is quite different from all previously reported Cr2O3-,

V2O5-, or Ga2O3-based catalyst systems during propane or ethane
dehydrogenation [4,16,28,42,43]. After the induction period, signif-
icantly higher dehydrogenation activities that lead to selective
conversion of propane with propylene yield in the range of 10–
15% can be achieved for the In2O3–Al2O3 samples. The activity for
the mixed oxide samples were shown to be exceptionally stable
from 2 to 12 h, i.e. for In–Al-20 only a conversion loss by 2.2%
was detected.
The dehydrogenation of propane was also run over the In2O3–
Al2O3 mixed oxide samples as well as their simple oxide analogs
at 873 K in the presence of CO2, as was depicted in Fig. 5. The re-
sults show that the steady activity of the In2O3–Al2O3 catalysts in
the presence of CO2 is twice that in the absence of CO2, although
a slightly longer induction period (ca. 3 h) is required. It can be
seen that all In2O3–Al2O3 samples led to a signiﬁcant production
of propylene with high selectivities (>70%) and appreciable ‘‘ini-
tial” steady conversions of propane ranging from ca. 27–37% at
3 h on stream. The ‘‘initial” steady conversions of propane de-
creased in the order In–Al-20 > In–Al-10 > In–Al-40. Note that the
conversion of CO2 in terms of reaction rate closely resembles to
that of propane over all catalysts. The positive effect of CO2 concen-
tration on the propane dehydrogenation over In–Al-20 can be fur-
ther seen from Fig. 6. All data were collected at the reaction time of
3 h. One can see that the rate of propylene formation remarkably
increased together with that of CO formation with increasing the
partial pressure of CO2. On the other hand, the rate of H2 formation
showed no signiﬁcant increase even with increasing the partial
pressure of CO2. All these facts indicate that the essential role of

CO2 is to promote the dehydrogenation process (CH3CH2CH3 ?
CH2 = CHCH3 + H2) by coupling the reaction of CO2 with H2 (CO2 +
H2 ? CO + H2O), which shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium
by consuming H2. It is also interesting to remark that, owing to
its intrinsic equilibrium nature, the overall RWGS reaction efﬁ-
ciency is not necessarily 100%, which can explain the evolution
trend of the H2 formation rate as a function of the CO2 feed concen-
tration as indicated in Fig. 6.
One of the biggest challenges in propane dehydrogenation with
CO2 is the deactivation of catalysts over a long period of reaction.
To examine the likely long-term stability of the In–Al mixed oxide
catalysts under the reaction conditions, an extended 30 h on-
stream operation for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence
of CO2 was carried out on the In–Al-20 catalyst. As shown in
Fig. 7, even after 30 h on-stream operation, a high conversion of
propane up to 25.5% could still be maintained for In–Al-20. It is
important to remark that this corresponds to only a 2.9% loss of
its quasi steady activity at 8 h on stream. This is in sharp contrast
to the previously reported supported Ga2O3-based system for PDH
with CO2, in which most of the gallia catalysts inclined to deacti-
vate drastically in a few hours [29,30]. With high selectivity to pro-
pylene, such outstanding stability as to the indium-containing
catalysts has never been reported before. This slowing of deactiva-
tion, when compared to the conventional Ga2O3-based catalysts,
could be due to a moderate coke formation as a consequence of
the apparently lower surface acidity of the supported indium-
based materials. It is important, however, to point out that the
In–Al-20 catalyst would deactivate rapidly within 12 h under reac-
tion conditions with higher concentrated C3H8 feeds (for example,
P(C3H8) = 20 kPa; P(CO2) = 20 kPa; P(N2) = 60 kPa; total ﬂow rate:
100 mL min1) (data not shown), possibly due to accelerated coke
formation under more demanding conditions. Attempt was also
made to regenerate In–Al-20 after 30 h on stream by re-calcination
of the used catalyst in ﬂowing air at 873 K for 4 h followed by sub-

that the original activity of In–Al-20 could be fully restored, with
no noticeable deactivation being detected even after the third
regeneration.
3.4. Active sites and structure–activity relationships
Previous investigations concerning the use of Cr2O3-, V2O5-, or
Ga2O3-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the pres-
ence of CO2 have shown that, depending on the nature of the active
sites, the reaction may proceed via two different reaction path-
ways. More speciﬁcally, it has been demonstrated that CO2 im-
proves the yield of propylene by two independent pathways. CO2
can participate as an oxidizing agent in a Mars–van Krevelen-type
redox cycle, in which the consumption and replenishment of the
lattice surface oxygen species play a key role in the reaction pro-
cess. Such simple redox mechanism has been proposed for the
chromium, and vanadium oxide-based catalysts [16,42,43]. On
the other hand, CO2 can play a role in a removal of hydrogen pro-
duced in the dehydrogenation of propane by the reverse water–gas
shift reaction. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts
the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward the propylene formation.
Such promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of
propylene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts [7].
Given the high performance of the In2O3–Al2O3 catalyst for PDH,
it is of interest to clarify the likely active species responsible for the
observed dehydrogenation activity. It may be noted that the surface
acidity or basicity (Tables S1 and S2) was not in line with the activ-
ity of different catalysts (Figs. 4 and 5), inferring that the surface
acid–base nature is not the key factor governing the catalytic per-
formance of the In2O3–Al2O3 samples. Taking into account the fact
that the highly dispersed In2O3 is the widely accepted redox active
site for NOx removal during the SCR reaction [34,35], one might
envisage that the present dehydrogenation reaction can proceed
via a direct redox mechanism involving alternate reduction and oxi-
dation of the surface InOx sites. To testify this hypothesis, the TPR of
the In–Al-20 sample was conducted after ‘‘reoxidation” of a hydro-
gen-pretreated In–Al-20 sample by CO2. It should be mentioned
here that the H2-pre-treatment temperature at 773 K permits the
reduction of the highly dispersed In2O3 but not the bulk one (see
Fig. 2). As noted above, if the simple redox pathway is followed,
one might expect that the reduced indium species would be readily
re-oxidized by CO2 atmosphere at 873 K. Nevertheless, the TPR pro-
ﬁle as shown in Fig. 2e does not show any LT reduction feature in
the temperature range of 473–773 K. This fact, together with the
XPS analysis revealing that CO2 is incapable of re-oxidizing In0 to
In2O3 (see Fig. 3c), strongly indicates that the direct redox mecha-
nism is not applicable for the present In2O3-catalyzed dehydroge-
nation of propane in the presence of CO2.
To further elucidate the active sites in the In2O3–Al2O3 system,
the performance of the most active In–Al-20 catalyst for PDH in the
absence of CO2 was investigated after the pre-treatment with
hydrogen (5% H2/Ar at 773 K for 1 h). It is important to remark that
the H2-pre-treatment has a distinct inﬂuence on performance evo-
lution of In–Al-20 at the initial stage of the reaction (Fig. 4), with
essentially no inﬂuence on the steady-state activity of the catalyst.
It is of interest to note that the H2-pretreated In–Al-20 shows
immediate high initial activity for PDH without experiencing the
induction period as observed with the fresh In–Al-20 sample.
Moreover, it must be pointed out that it is only after the induction
period (ca. 2 h on stream) a steady conversion of propane with pro-
nounced selectivity to propylene can be attained for fresh In–Al-20.
All these facts, together with the XPS results showing a concomi-
tant reduction of the dispersed In2O3 to the corresponding metallic
In0 species (see Fig. 5d), suggest that the surface-stabilized metallic
In0 nanoclusters that are generated in situ during the induction
period could be the key active species for propane dehydrogena-
tion. This speculation is further corroborated by the excellent cor-
relation as identiﬁed for the relationship between the catalytic
dehydrogenation activity and the amount of metallic In0 species
derived from the highly dispersed indium oxide species in the
present In2O3–Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 8).
Having established that In0 species are the true active sites for
simple dehydrogenation, it is also highly important to establish
the possible role of indium in RWGS that may contribute to the po-
sitive effect of CO2 for PDH. To this end, a temperature-pro-
grammed reaction of CO2 with H2 was conducted over the In2O3–
Al2O3 samples as well as their simple oxide analogs, and the corre-
sponding signals of CO were collected in Fig. 9a. It is evident that
samples with higher fraction of bulk In2O3 exhibit higher yield of
CO at identical temperatures, and the activity decreases in the or-
der of In2O3 > In–Al-40 > In–Al-20 > In–Al-10 > Al2O3. This may
suggest that bulk In2O3 is likely to be the active species for RWGS.
To further conﬁrm this assumption, In–Al-20 samples after pre-
reduction at 773 and 1073 K were tested for RWGS, and the corre-
sponding results were compared with that of the fresh In–Al-20 as
shown in Fig. 9b. For the 773 K-reduced In–Al-20 (Fig. 9g), in which
only highly dispersed In2O3 was converted to In0, analogous activ-
ity to that of the fresh In–Al-20 is obtained, suggesting that the
metallic In0 may not be the key species for the RWGS reaction.
For the 1073 K-reduced In–Al-20 (Fig. 9h), in which all indium
was thoroughly reduced, dramatically lower CO yield relative to
that of fresh In–Al-20 was observed. All these results clearly sug-
gest that it is bulk In2O3 rather than metallic indium or highly dis-
persed In2O3 performed as the active phase for RWGS.
Finally, it is important to highlight that metallic indium, previ-
ously known to be a useful promoter in a number of formulated
Pt–In/Al2O3 systems for commercial propane dehydrogenation
[44,45], could become an interesting CO2-mediated dehydrogena-
tion catalyst when ﬁnely dispersed on a suitable support. More sig-
niﬁcantly, In2O3–Al2O3 was a far better catalyst in terms of catalytic

stability for PDH with CO2 compared to the most effective Ga2O3-
based catalysts in the current literature [25,26]. Being different
from all previously reported systems (for example, Cr2O3, V2O5,
Ga2O3) [4,16,28,42,43], the results described in the present work
show clearly a unique bifunctional character of the indium compo-
nent in the In2O3–Al2O3 materials for propane dehydrogenation
with CO2. In this context, the overall reaction pathway can be envis-
aged to involve both metallic In species and the bulk In2O3 phase
during the CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation process, i.e.,
the reaction proceeds via a simple metallic In0-catalyzed dehydro-
genation pathway facilitated by the RWGS reaction catalyzed by
bulk In2O3. On the basis of the proposed main reaction pathway
as described above, we can rationalize that a well balance of the
metallic In species and the bulk In2O3 phase is indispensable for
an efﬁcient propane dehydrogenation over the In2O3–Al2O3 system.
4. Conclusions
The present work demonstrates the high potential of a new
class of catalytic materials based on binary In–Al–O nanocompos-
ites for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. An optimum in
the catalytic behavior was achieved for the catalyst containing 20%
(atom.) In2O3, which can afford a propylene yield of 27.3% and
maintain an exceptionally steady propane conversion of >24% dur-
ing 30 h on stream. XRD and H2-TPR characterizations suggest that
the combination of indium and aluminum can result in signiﬁcant
modiﬁcation in the bulk dispersion and surface redox properties of
the In2O3 phase. The correlation of the catalytic activity and the
TPR data unambiguously clarify that the creation and maintenance
of surface metallic indium species in optimal surface concentration
at the initial stage of the reaction are essential for achieving pro-
nounced dehydrogenation activity. The promoting effect of CO2
on the yield of propylene over the mixed oxide catalysts has been
attributed to a facilitation of simple dehydrogenation by coupling
with the bulk In2O3-catalyzed RWGS reaction.
