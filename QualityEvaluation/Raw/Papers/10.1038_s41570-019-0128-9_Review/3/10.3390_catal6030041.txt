Abstract: Vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1, with VOx loading ranging from 2.5 to 17.5 wt. %,
was developed as a highly active catalyst in dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. The obtained
catalysts of VOx/MSU-1 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption,
and H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) methods and the results showed that the large
surface area of MSU-1 was favorable for the dispersion of VOx species and the optimal loading of VOx
was 12.0 wt. %. Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of VOx/MSU-1 was investigated, and VOx/MSU-1
with 12.0 wt. % VOx content was found to be the best one, with the conversion of isobutane (58.8%)
and the selectivity of isobutene (78.5%) under the optimal reaction conditions. In contrast with the
reaction in the absence of CO2, the presence of CO2 in the reaction stream could obviously enhance the
isobutane dehydrogenation, which raised the conversion of reaction and the stability of VOx/MSU-1.
Keywords: VOx/MSU-1 catalyst; isobutane; dehydrogenation; isobutene; CO2
1. Introduction
Dehydrogenation of lower alkanes to alkenes is always attractive research around the world [1–4].
With the use of downstream products of isobutene increasing [5,6], the demand of isobutene is
rapidly growing, so the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene is becoming one of the important
ways to produce isobutene. The process of dehydrogenation can be classiﬁed into two types: direct
dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation. In fact, the direct dehydrogenation of isobutane to
isobutene has been achieved in industrialization [7], but there are still some serious technical problems,
such as high production cost, complex processing, and deactivation of the catalyst by carbon deposition.
As a result, the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane (ODB) has received more and more attention,
recently [8,9]. ODB will not be limited by thermodynamic equilibrium, so the conversion of isobutane
can obviously be raised and the energy consumption can be greatly reduced. Due to the deep oxidation
of product, there is lower isobutene selectivity using oxygen (O2) as an oxidant [10,11]. Recently, CO2
has received much attention as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation, because CO2 can act as a mild
oxidant [12–15]. Unlike oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state
due to its weak oxidation capacity. It is a thermodynamically stable and a kinetically inert molecule,

and it is also cheap and abundant. Moreover, because of its high heat capacity, using CO2 as a co-feed
can alleviate the effects of the exothermal ODB reaction, avoiding hot spots that can lead to cracking of
the alkane [14,16]. It has been conﬁrmed that CO2 had the ability to partially refresh active species
on the catalysts and participated in the oxidative dehydrogenation [17]. When CO2 was present in
the feed, the reaction followed the oxidative dehydrogenation route but was also accompanied by the
reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction in combination with the direct dehydrogenation route [17,18].
Moreover, CO2 can eliminate coke deposited over the catalysts, to some extent, and improve the
stability of catalysts [19]. Therefore, in recent years, the research of dehydrogenation of isobutane with
CO2 has been actively studied, which mainly focused on the development of different catalysts.
The catalysts containing vanadium were found to have excellent catalytic activity for the
dehydrogenation reaction [20–25]. Ogonowski et al. [24] loaded vanadium oxides on active carbon
(AC), SiO2, Al2O3, and ZnO, and found that the key factor inﬂuencing catalytic activity was the
alkalinity/acidity of catalyst surface and oxidation-reduction potential of vanadium species. Research
of Ma et al. [25] on V2O5/Al2O3 and V2O5/SiO2 catalyst showed that vanadium species with higher
dispersion had better catalytic activity. However, the traditional carriers, such as Al2O3 and SiO2,
possessed low speciﬁc surface area, small pore size and wide pore size distribution, which restricted
the activity of catalysts. In view of these, mesoporous materials used as the carrier were widely studied.
MSU-x is an important family of mesoporous material, with 3D worm-like holes, which possess many
advantages of pore structure and is in favor of the diffusion of molecular objects [26]. Furthermore,
the non-ionic surfactants used as templates in the synthesis of MSU-x materials are low-cost, non-toxic,
and biodegradable; thus, it is more suitable for the carriers of catalysts. In the early work of our group,
the catalysts had been prepared by loading chromium on MSU-x for catalytic dehydrogenation of
propane and ethane [27–30], which had showed high catalytic activity.
In this paper, MSU-1, was prepared at room temperature using sodium silicate as the
source of silicon.
Then, vanadium oxide, VOx, was loaded over the carrier of MSU-1 and a
series of vanadium-based catalysts, VOx/MSU-1, were prepared by wet impregnation method.
The obtained catalysts were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption,
and H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) techniques. The catalytic performance of
VOx/MSU-1 was investigated for the dehydrogenation of isobutane with or without CO2.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Catalyst Characterization
Figure 1 showed XRD patterns of the samples prepared, including undoped and VOx-modiﬁed
MSU-1 (VOx/MSU-1) in two different regions of 2θ angle, where they were 0.5˝–10˝ and 10˝–85˝.
In the 2θ range of 0.5˝–10˝, one well-resolved diffraction peak was observed (Figure 1A), which
corresponded to d100 reﬂection [31]. This result clearly indicated that they all had the typically less
long-range-ordered, worm-like mesoporous structure. Compared with undoped MSU-1, the intensity
of diffraction peak of VOx-containing MSU-1 gradually decreased with VOx content increasing.
However, even in the case of MSU-1 with the highest VOx loading, 17.5 wt. %, the d100 diffraction peak
were still obviously observed, indicating that the mesoporous structure of the catalysts, VOx/MSU-1,
remained well during impregnation and subsequent calcination.
According to the large-angle XRD patterns of 10˝–85˝ (Figure 1B), it could be seen that the
diffraction peaks corresponding to crystal phase of V2O5 were 15.5˝, 20.2˝, 26.2˝, and 31.1˝. However,
these peaks were absent for the samples with VOx loading lower than 12.0 wt. %. This could be
attributed to high dispersion of crystal phase of bulk V2O5 on the surface of MSU-1. When VOx
loading reached 17.5 wt. %, the peaks became very clear, which indicated that more and larger crystal
phase of bulk V2O5 appeared over MSU-1 with the increase of VOx loading. The catalytic activity and
selectivity of vanadium oxide for oxidative dehydrogenation depended on its structure, dispersion,
and the characteristics of its supporting material. The most active catalytic form for this type of reaction

was the monomeric, isolated VOx species [32]. The presence of bulk V2O5 on the other hand decreased
the selectivity and favored total oxidation. So, the ﬁt VOx loading for VOx/MSU-1 catalysts should be
12.0 wt. % or so.

and  the  characteristics  of  its  supporting  material.  The  most  active  catalytic  form  for  this  type  of 
reaction was the monomeric, isolated VOx species [32]. The presence of bulk V2O5 on the other hand

Table 1 listed Brunauer‐Emmett‐Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume of undoped and

area (1021.3 m2/g) and moderate pore volume (0.54 cm3/g), which was favorable for the dispersion of 
active  components.  As  for  VOx/MSU‐1  samples,  both  surface  area  and  pore  volume  decreased 
gradually with VOx content increasing in comparison to MSU‐1. This could be due to that more VOx 
loading led to the formation of larger VOx crystals and as a result, a certain amount of MSU‐1 pores 
was  blocked  by  the  bulk  crystals,  which  was  also  confirmed  by  XRD  patterns  of  VOx/MSU‐1 
samples (Figure 1). When VOx loading was 17.5 wt. %, the surface area and pore volume of VOx/MSU‐

The  pore  diameter  distribution  of  different  samples  was  shown  in  Figure  2,  which  was

distribution  was  narrow  and  normal,  indicating  that  the  carrier  of  MSU‐1  had  a  uniform  pore

the peak had moved to 1.8 nm from 2.2 nm, which suggested that some pores of MSU‐1 might be partly 
occupied by vanadium oxides, resulting in smaller pore size. As a result, the pore size distribution of 
VOx/MSU‐1 catalysts were broadened and the surface area and pore volume were decreased.

Table 1 listed Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume of undoped and
VOx-modiﬁed MSU-1. From Table 1, it could be seen that the carrier of MSU-1 possessed high-surface
area (1021.3 m2/g) and moderate pore volume (0.54 cm3/g), which was favorable for the dispersion
of active components. As for VOx/MSU-1 samples, both surface area and pore volume decreased
gradually with VOx content increasing in comparison to MSU-1. This could be due to that more
VOx loading led to the formation of larger VOx crystals and as a result, a certain amount of
MSU-1 pores was blocked by the bulk crystals, which was also conﬁrmed by XRD patterns of
VOx/MSU-1 samples (Figure 1). When VOx loading was 17.5 wt. %, the surface area and pore volume
of VOx/MSU-1 decreased to 297.9 m2/g and 0.30 cm3/g, respectively, which was not advantageous to
the dehydrogenation of isobutane.

The pore diameter distribution of different samples was shown in Figure 2, which was determined
by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. As shown in Figure 2, the peak at 2.2 nm was attributed to
the characteristic behavior of mesoporous materials MSU-1, and the pore size distribution was narrow
and normal, indicating that the carrier of MSU-1 had a uniform pore structure. Moreover, with VOx
content increasing, the peak shape gradually moved to the left, as a whole, and the width of peak also
increased in the meantime. When VOx loading reached 17.5 wt. %, the peak had moved to 1.8 nm from
2.2 nm, which suggested that some pores of MSU-1 might be partly occupied by vanadium oxides,
resulting in smaller pore size. As a result, the pore size distribution of VOx/MSU-1 catalysts were
broadened and the surface area and pore volume were decreased.

MSU‐1 in Figure 3. For the samples containing 2.5–12.0 wt. % VOx, a weak reduction peak at 680–720 K 
were observed, in which vanadium species existed mainly in the form of surface oligo‐species with 
the octahedral coordination [33]. TPR curves of all VOx‐supported samples, VOx loading from 2.5 wt. % 
to 17.0 wt. %, exhibited one strong reduction peak in the temperature range of 820–850 K, which was 
found to shift to higher temperatures as the VOx loading was increased, suggesting increased particle 
size of microcrystalline vanadia with loading. This has been confirmed that as the vanadia species 
became more bulk‐like, i.e., the particle size increased with an increase in loading, the vanadia became 
more difficult to reduce due to bulk diffusion limitations resulting in a shift in TPR peaks to higher 
temperatures [33,34]. The samples, containing more than 7.0 wt. % VOx were characterized by new 
peaks  appearing  already  between  920  and  970  K,  which  gradually  increased  with  VOx  loading, 
showing that more bulk‐like VOx crystals had been shaped. This had been concluded that there was 
a correlation between the reducibility of surface vanadium species and their catalytic properties. High 
activity was ascribed to vanadate species, either isolated or polymerized up to the formation of a VOx 
monolayer, whereas lower activity was usually associated with the presence of bulk V2O5 [34,35].

H2-TPR patterns of undoped MSU-1 and VOx/MSU-1 catalysts with different VOx loading were
comparatively shown in Figure 3. There were no H2 consumption peaks to be found for undoped
MSU-1 in Figure 3. For the samples containing 2.5–12.0 wt. % VOx, a weak reduction peak at 680–720 K
were observed, in which vanadium species existed mainly in the form of surface oligo-species with the
octahedral coordination [33]. TPR curves of all VOx-supported samples, VOx loading from 2.5 wt. %
to 17.0 wt. %, exhibited one strong reduction peak in the temperature range of 820–850 K, which
was found to shift to higher temperatures as the VOx loading was increased, suggesting increased
particle size of microcrystalline vanadia with loading. This has been conﬁrmed that as the vanadia
species became more bulk-like, i.e., the particle size increased with an increase in loading, the vanadia
became more difﬁcult to reduce due to bulk diffusion limitations resulting in a shift in TPR peaks to
higher temperatures [33,34]. The samples, containing more than 7.0 wt. % VOx were characterized by
new peaks appearing already between 920 and 970 K, which gradually increased with VOx loading,
showing that more bulk-like VOx crystals had been shaped. This had been concluded that there was a
correlation between the reducibility of surface vanadium species and their catalytic properties. High
activity was ascribed to vanadate species, either isolated or polymerized up to the formation of a VOx
monolayer, whereas lower activity was usually associated with the presence of bulk V2O5 [34,35].

2.2. Catalytic Performance
The catalytic performance of VOx/MSU-1 with different VOx loading for the isobutane
dehydrogenation were shown in Table 2, where the main byproducts of reaction were also listed out,
including propylene (C3H6) and methane (CH4). Undoped MSU-1 exhibited low catalytic activity in
comparison to VOx-doped samples, with 11.8% conversion of isobutane (i-C4H10) and 52.5% selectivity
of isobutene (i-C4H8) (Entry 1). The conversion of isobutane gradually increased with VOx loading, and
reached maximum value, 58.8% (Entry 4), when VOx loading was 12 wt. %. While VOx loading further
increased to 17.5 wt. %, the conversion of isobutane begun to decrease to 51.0% (Entry 6). This could
be due to that more VOx loading resulted in the poor dispersion of VOx species and formation of
more bulk-like VOx crystals, which had been demonstrated by XRD (Figure 1) and H2-TPR (Figure 3)
characterization. However, the selectivity of isobutene did not exhibit obvious change in a certain
extent with the increase of VOx loading, basically keeping at 79% or so. The selectivity of main
byproducts, propylene and methane, also remained stable in principle, approximately 10% and 5%,
respectively. Moreover, contrasting Entries 4 and 5 in Table 2, it could be found that the presence of CO2
signiﬁcantly enhanced the efﬁciency of isobutane dehydrogenation, which was generally attributed to
that CO2 as a weak oxidant could eliminate hydrogen produced during the dehydrogenation through
RWGS reaction [18,36]. Coupling of RWGS reaction with the dehydrogenation reaction therefore
improved the equilibrium conversion of reaction toward isobutene production. In Table 2, with CO2
conversion increasing, the conversion of isobutane gradually increased, which further conﬁrmed the
role of CO2 coupling reaction.

Reaction conditions: reaction temperature 873 K, total flow rate 24 mL/min, catalyst 0.2 g, V(CO2):V(i-C4H10) = 3:1;
* V(Ar):V(i-C4H10) = 3:1.
The effect of temperature on the dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2 were shown in Figure 4,
using 12 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 as catalyst. The conversion of isobutane gradually increased as the
reaction temperature was raised, whereas the selectivity of isobutene, the object product, decreased
on the contrary. Although high temperature could accelerate the dehydrogenation rate of isobutane,
meanwhile the elevation of temperature favored cracking of isobutane to produce propylene and
methane. So, considering all reaction factors, 873 K was chosen as the optimal reaction temperature,
with the conversion of isobutane 58.8% and the selectivity of isobutene 78.5%.
Figure 5 exhibited the catalytic activity of 12 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 as a function of reaction time.
As the reaction proceeded, the isobutane conversion of dehydrogenation gave a visible drop, either in
the presence of or in the absence of CO2, suggesting that the catalyst was deactivated to some degree.
In contrast with the reaction in the absence of CO2, the presence of CO2 in the reaction stream here
could obviously enhance the stability of VOx/MSU-1, and the drop rate of isobutane conversion with
CO2 was lower than that without CO2. For example, the conversion of isobutane decreased from
primal 58.8% to 44.2% with CO2 and 40.5% to 21.9% without CO2, respectively, after reacting for 3 h.
This was due to that CO2 in the reaction stream could suppress the formation of coke deposited over
VOx/MSU-1 [17,37,38]. Moreover, from Figure 5, it could also be seen that the selectivity to isobutene
gave a slight increase with proceeding reaction, especially with CO2.

The carrier of MSU-1 was prepared at room temperature using sodium silicate as the source of 
silicon by the method reported before [22,23]. All the catalysts of VOx/MSU-1 were prepared by wet 
impregnation method. Typically, 2 g of dry MSU-1 was treated with 20 mL of aqueous solution 
containing the desired amount of NH4VO3 (analytically pure) overnight. The impregnated samples 
were evaporated and dried at 353 K for 7 h and finally calcined under air at 873 K for 4 h. These 
catalysts are designated as x wt. % VOx/MSU-1, where x expresses the total VOx loading.

3.2. Catalyst Characterization
XRD patterns were recorded in two ranges of 0.5˝–10.0˝ and 10˝–85˝ (2θ) at room temperature,
using X’pert Pro MPD X-ray diffractometer from PANalytical (Almelo, Holland) operated at 40 kV and
30 mA, equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray source.
N2 adsorption-desorption measurements were carried out on an Autosorb series ASIMP apparatus
from Quantachrome (Boynton Beach, FL, USA). Before measurements, the samples were degassed at
573 K under vacuum for 3 h. Calculation of speciﬁc surface area (BET), pore volume and pore size
distribution (BJH method) were performed with the software of the apparatus.
H2-TPR analysis (self-made experimental instrument) were performed using Ar/H2 gas mixture
(95/5 vol %). The total ﬂow rate of the feed was 30 mL/min. Before experiment the sample (100 mg)
was preheated in a stream of dry argon at 873 K for 30 min, and then cooled to room temperature.
The samples were heated at 15 K/min to the ﬁnal temperature of 1073 K. H2 consumption was
measured by a thermal conductivity detector and V2O5 was used as a reference for the calibration of
H2 consumption.
3.3. Catalytic Tests
The catalytic tests of isobutane dehydrogenation were carried out in a ﬁxed-bed quartz tubular
reactor with an inner diameter of 6.0 mm at 773–973 K and atmospheric pressure. For each test,
about 0.2 g of catalyst sample (40–60 mesh) was diluted with quartz grain and loaded in the constant
temperature zone of the reactor. The reaction stream was constituted of isobutane and CO2 or Ar with
the mole ratio of n(CO2)/n(C4H10) or n(Ar)/n(C4H10) being 3 and the total ﬂow rate being 24 mL/min.
The reactants and products were analyzed on-line using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014,
Kyoto, Japan). One of column was equipped Rt-Al2O3 (30 m ˆ 0.53 mm ˆ 10.0 µm) and a ﬂame
ionization detector. This column was used to analyze hydrocarbons C1–C4. The second column was
equipped GDX-502 (3 m ˆ 2 mm) and a thermal conductivity detector for CO and CO2 analyses, which
carrier gas is He. Conversion (C) of isobutane and carbon dioxide and selectivity (S) of isobutene and
other byproducts were calculated according to the following equations:

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the catalysts of VOx/MSU-1, prepared by loading VOx over MSU-1, were active
and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. Their catalytic properties were
related to the VOx loading and high surface area of MSU-1. XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption and
H2-TPR characterization for VOx/MSU-1 showed that the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. % and
more VOx could led to the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals and the decrease of the surface
area and pore volume. As a result, 12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 exhibited the highest catalytic activity,
with the conversion of isobutane 58.8% and the selectivity of isobutene 78.5% at 873 K. In the feed
of reactants, the presence of CO2 played quite important role on the dehydrogenation of isobutane,

which not only could remove H2 produced in the reaction through RWGS reaction but also suppress
the formation of coke deposits and improve the stability of VOx/MSU-1.
