Pure Pd, Pt, and bimetallic Pd–Pt clusters produced by laser
vaporization of bulk metals or alloys have been deposited on a
high surface area alumina (γ -Al2O3). The bimetallic clusters have
a perfectly well-deﬁned stoichiometry, as demonstrated by energy-
dispersive X-ray analysis experiments. Transmission electron mi-
croscopy shows that pure or bimetallic clusters have similar size
distributions. The catalytic properties of Pd, Pt, Pd17Pt83, and
Pd65Pt35 supported clusters have been investigated in the vapor-
phase toluene hydrogenation over a wide range of reaction condi-
tions. The activation energies are 44 ± 6 kJ/mol. The pressure de-
pendence on toluene varies from 0 at 333 K to 0.7 at 500 K whereas
this dependence on H2 increases from approximately 0.5 at 333 K
up to 2.2 at 500 K. The results obtained with the pure metals cor-
roborate those reported in the literature for catalysts prepared by
chemical methods. The activities of the bimetallic catalysts do not
show any synergy between Pd and Pt but rather a perfect additivity
of their individual catalytic properties. Pt has been shown to have
no electronic inﬂuence on the reactivity of Pd atoms. The nonlinear
variation of the turnover frequency as a function of the Pd surface
concentration is interpreted on the basis of an active site composed
of a pair of atoms.

INTRODUCTION
Supported metal catalysts modiﬁed by addition of a sec-
ond metal may substantially differ in terms of activity or
selectivity from their monometallic counterparts (1). The
ﬁnal goal of catalytic studies with alloy catalysts is to learn
about the functioning of metals and to rationally design
catalysts with improved catalytic properties. Bimetallic
catalysts based on the association of palladium and
platinum have been extensively studied. On one hand,
Koussathana et al. (2) found that bimetallic Pd–Pt formu-
lations exhibit higher activities than the two pure metals
toward the hydrogenation of naphthalene and biphenyl.

This enhancement of activity was found to depend on the
support. Blomsma et al. (3) reported that zeolite-supported
Pd–Pt bimetallic bifunctional catalysts are more active and
selective in the isomerization of heptane than pure Pt or
Pd also supported on zeolite. The Pd–Pt system was also
studied by Carturan et al. (4) as a function of the Pd/Pt ra-
tio. They reported that in the styrene hydrogenation, the
activity of the bimetallic system displays a remarkable in-
crease up to 30% of Pt whereas in the range 30–100% Pt,
the activity is simply the sum of the individual activities.
On the other hand, Deganello and co-workers (5) ob-
served that the addition of Pt reduces both the activity and
the selectivity of the Pd catalysts in the liquid-phase hydro-
genation of 1,3-cyclooctadiene to cyclooctene. In the case of
the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene, Carturan
et al. (4) found that the speciﬁc activity of PdPt catalysts is
smaller than the sum of individual Pd and Pt in the 10–100%
Pt range.
Other studies have focused on the sulfur tolerance of
Pd–Pt alloy deposited on different supports such as Al2O3
(6), SiO2–Al2O3 (7, 8), Al2O3–B2O3 (9), or HY zeolite (10).
Industrial applications for hydrogenating aromatics and
oleﬁnsinhydrocarbonfeedstocksonsuchPd–Ptalloyswere
proposed and actually used in plants (11–14). This high sul-
fur resistance, greatly enhanced by using acidic supports,
is often believed to arise from the formation of electron-
deﬁcient metal particles.
Since the size, the structure, or the composition of sup-
ported bimetallics is difﬁcult to control for active phases
obtained by chemical methods, it is generally not straight-
forward to compare the catalytic properties of a bimetallic
catalyst to those of a monometallic one. To make the com-
parison easier, one needs to prepare monometallic and
bimetallic systems having approximately the same size,
morphology, and overall, uniform and well-deﬁned com-
position. The purpose of this paper is to show that all these
criteria are fulﬁlled by using the laser vaporization tech-
nique.
In this paper, we report on the preparation, the character-
ization, and the catalytic behavior of pure Pd or Pt as well

as bimetallic Pd–Pt clusters produced by laser vaporization
of bulk metals and alloys and deposited on high surface
area alumina (γ -Al2O3). The laser vaporization technique
allows the generation of ligand-free metal clusters and,
in the case of bimetallic systems, particles which all have
a composition identical to that of the vaporized alloyed
target.
The vapor-phase hydrogenation of toluene has been used
to test our catalysts since this reaction has been exten-
sively studied by the group of Vannice over monometallic
Pd/Al2O3 (15) and Pt/Al2O3 (16) catalysts prepared by the
incipient wetness technique.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalyst Preparation by Using Low-Energy
Cluster Beam Deposition
The laser vaporization cluster source has been exten-
sively described elsewhere (17). The second harmonic of
a Nd:YAG pulsed laser is used to vaporize the metal from
a rod to create a plasma. Cluster nucleation and growth
occur when a continuous ﬂux of inert gas (a mixture of
He and Ar) is introduced into the chamber. Differential
pumpingextractionoftheclustersthroughaskimmeryields
a cluster beam which carries neutral and ionized species.
The ionized clusters can be analyzed by time-of-ﬂight mass
spectrometry (TOFMS). After removal of the ionized clus-
ters by electrostatic deﬂection, the neutral clusters are de-
posited on the substrates. Typical deposition rates (equiv-
alent thicknesses) of about 5 nm/min are obtained with
neutral clusters of various materials. The deposition rates
were monitored using a quartz microbalance. To deposit
the clusters on the support, which in the present case is a
γ -alumina powder (Condea, Puralox SCFa-240 with a spe-
ciﬁc area of 240 m2/g), a device was developed which stirs
the power in front of the cluster beam. This device is ex-
pected to favor homogeneous cluster deposition on most
of the powder grains. After deposition, the samples are air
transferred, characterized, and/or used for catalytic reac-
tions. For these experiments, Pd and Pt rods of 99.99 and
99.95% purity, respectively, as well as Pd17Pt83 and Pd65Pt35
bimetallic rods obtained by melting Pd (99.99% purity)
and Pt (99.95% purity) were used. Three grams of Pd, Pt,
Pd17Pt83, and Pd65Pt35 γ -alumina-supported catalysts was
prepared. Chemical analysis revealed the metal content of
each catalyst, and the corresponding metal loading values
are reported in Table 1.
Catalyst Characterization
The morphologic characterization of the supported clus-
ters was performed with a JEOL JEM 2010-F transmis-
sion electron microscope (TEM) operating at 200 kV and

equippedwithaﬁeldemissiongun(FEG),ahigh-resolution
UHR pole piece (point resolution: 0.196 nm). The composi-
tion analysis of the bimetallic systems was done by energy-
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) with a Pentafet-
Link ISIS EDX spectrometer from Oxford Instruments in
the TEM.
To obtain suitable samples for TEM characterization, the
as-obtained powders were dispersed in ethanol by ultrason-
ication. A drop of the solution was then deposited onto a
thin holey-carbon ﬁlm supported on a copper microscopy
grid (200 mesh, 3.05 mm) and left to dry. The grains of pow-
der containing the metallic particles are well separated and
may thus be characterized by TEM.
The determination of the size of the clusters and their dis-
tribution over the supports was performed by TEM imag-
ing. Sufﬁciently intense condensed probes (0.5–2.4 nm) can
be obtained with the FEG, which allows EDX-S analysis
of very reduced volumes and thus of individual nanometer-
size particles. This was performed to verify the chemical ho-
mogeneity of the deposited clusters. Large-scale (>20 nm)
EDX-S analysis of more or less large collections of particles
was also performed by defocusing the electron probe to the
required size.
Catalytic Activity Measurements: Toluene Hydrogenation
The hydrogenation of toluene was carried out in a ﬁxed-
bed gas-ﬂow microreactor at a constant pressure of 760 Torr
(1 atm) between 350 and 540 K. The partial pressure of
toluene (Fluka, purity >99%) was varied between 5 and
40 Torr by using a gas-phase saturator system. The partial
pressure of H2 was controlled by dilution with N2 and the
gas ﬂow rates were measured by mass ﬂow meters (Brooks,
0–200 cm3/min). Toluene and methylcyclohexane, which
were the only products detected, were analyzed with an
in-line gas chromatograph equipped with a ﬂame ioniza-
tion detector. The amount of catalyst, which was about
500 mg for each experiment, and the ﬂow rates were chosen
to obtain a conversion below 10%, at which a differential
model for the determination of the speciﬁc rates of reac-
tion can be applied. Prior to the ﬁrst activity measurement,

each catalyst was pretreated at 573 K for 2 h under
hydrogen.
For each data point, a bracketing technique was em-
ployed (18), which consisted of 30 min for the system to
reach the steady state, 30 min to perform several sample
analyses, and again 30 min under pure H2 for the regen-
eration of the catalyst, which actually recovers its former
activity. During the regeneration, the setup was adjusted
to the reaction conditions for the next data point. At the
end of the data collection under a range of reaction condi-
tions, several experimental points were repeated to check
for the possible deactivation of the catalyst, which was al-
ways found to be negligible.
RESULTS
Transmission Electron Microscopy Experiments
Microscopy experiments were performed on each cata-
lyst at three different stages: (1) fresh samples, (2) pre-

treated samples heated for 2 h at 573 K under hydrogen
ﬂow, and (3) after reaction. The photographs for stages 1
and 3 are displayed respectively in Figs. 1 and 2 for Pd17Pt83
and pure Pt samples. The size histograms, i.e., before and
after reaction, are presented respectively in Figs. 3 and 4.
The mean size and standard deviation for all the fresh sam-
ples was found to be nearly identical (Table 1). This indi-
cates that the vaporization source produces clusters of the
same size whatever the metals or alloys. This has been al-
ready checked for other systems such as, for example, Au,
Ni, and AuNi clusters (19). After reaction, TEM (Fig. 2)
shows that the crystallites have a mean diameter larger than
that of the fresh catalysts (Table 1). However, this diameter
is identical to that observed for the preheated samples be-
fore reaction. Since the catalytic properties of the catalysts
do not vary appreciably during the catalytic test, one can de-
duce that the observed increase of the mean particle size has
already occurred during the annealing treatment and not
during the reaction. Later on, the structure of the catalysts
does not undergo any further change. Energy-dispersive

X-ray analysis was used to study the composition of indi-
vidual particles by defocusing the 1-nm2 probe to the size
of each analyzed cluster for both Pd17Pt83 and Pd65Pt35
bimetallic samples. Consequently, for both systems, the
composition homogeneity was checked and found to be
equal to that of the vaporized rod. Figure 5 shows the com-
position corresponding to the analysis of supported parti-
cles for both alloys.
Toluene Hydrogenation
At temperatures below 430 K, the reaction rates mea-
sured for all samples lead to linear Arrhenius plots (Fig. 6).
The activation energies deduced from these plots in this
temperature range are listed in Table 2. The activation en-
ergies corresponding to pure Pd and Pt are consistent with
those measured on samples prepared by chemical methods
(15, 16).
As the temperature is increased, the activity of these
catalysts passes through a reversible maximum (Fig. 7).
The turnover frequencies (TOF) based on surface metal-
lic atoms were deduced from TEM experiments and size

Dependences of the reaction rate on toluene and hydro-
gen pressures are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 and the derived re-
action orders are reported in Table 2. For each catalyst, the
experiments were performed at temperatures below and
above that of the maximum of activity (see Fig. 8). At low
temperature, the reaction order with respect to H2 is almost
independent of the catalyst, with a mean value of 0.6 ± 0.1.
At higher temperature, this reaction order increases to
reach values ranging from 1.7 for pure Pd to 2.2 for pure Pt.
The reaction order with respect to toluene is close to zero
at low temperature and increases only slightly up to values
ranging between 0.2 and 0.7 at higher temperature.
DISCUSSION
Determination of the Cluster Surface Compositions
The surface composition of alloys and especially the com-
position of the topmost surface layer are generally different

from that of the bulk composition due to segregation pro-
cesses (20). In a catalytic process, the reactants are adsorbed
onthesurface,implyingthataﬁrststepintheunderstanding
of the reactivity of alloys is the determination of the surface
composition. The low-energy ion scattering technique is a
surface-sensitive technique that selectively probes the out-
ermost atomic layer. Generally, this technique is used to
study bulk systems. Nevertheless, in a recent work (17), we
have shown that LEIS can be applied to PdPt bimetallic
clusters also produced by laser vaporization but deposited
on ﬂat supports. The main result is that the cluster surface
is enriched with Pd for both alloys. More precisely, the Pd
surface concentration reaches 38 and 87 at.% respectively
for Pd17Pt83 and Pd65Pt35 alloys. In parallel with the LEIS

experiments, the modeling of the segregation process has
been performed using Monte Carlo simulations (17). The
deduced surface concentrations are in good agreement with
experiments. Unfortunately, in the present case, we cannot
use the LEIS results obtained previously since the anneal-
ing treatment gives rise to a mean size larger than that of the
fresh catalyst and it is well known that surface segregation
increases as the size increases because of the mass balance
effect (the supply of atoms is limited for small particles).
Moreover, in the present case, the metal loading is too low
to measure by LEIS the surface composition with a rea-
sonable accuracy. Nevertheless, we can predict the surface
compositionbyusingourtheoreticalmodelsinceithasbeen
shown to give reliable results. The energetics model used
has been thoroughly described elsewhere (20) and only the
results will be presented in the present paper. The segrega-
tion behavior of Pd–Pt single-crystal alloys equilibrated at
600 K has been studied in this work and the ﬁrst-layer com-
position has been calculated over the whole concentration
range for the (111) and (100) orientations. For small parti-
cles, a large fraction of the atoms is located at the surface
and the reservoir of diffusing atoms is thus limited by the
total concentration of palladium. Therefore one has to cor-
rect the surface concentration determined for bulk alloys.
The mass conservation implies that the surface and bulk
concentrations (respectively XS and XB) of a cluster must
verify the following equation:
XN = DXS + (1 −D)XB
[1]
XN is the nominal concentration (in the present case, 17 or
65%) and D is the calculated dispersion of the considered
cluster assuming a truncated cubo-octahedral shape. For a
given set of XN and D, an inﬁnity of (XS, XB ) couples verify
this equation but the actual XS and XB values must also sat-
isfy the relation between surface and bulk composition cor-
responding to the thermodynamic equilibrium determined
for a semi-inﬁnite alloy (Fig. 10). Obviously, this unique
couple of XS and XB values is given by the ordinate and the
abscissa of the intersection of the straight line correspond-
ing to Eq. [1], with the theoretical curves representing the
surface composition of an equilibrated massive alloy. The
results concerning the Pd17Pt83 alloy are displayed in Fig. 10
and summarized in Table 3. With the procedure described
above, one calculates the surface Pd concentration and con-
sequently the number of Pd surface atoms for each cluster
size. Taking into account the size histogram of the Pd17Pt83
supported catalyst (Fig. 4) and weighting each class of size
by the predicted surface number of Pd atoms for both (100)
and (111) faces of the clusters (we have neglected corner
and edge sites), one calculates a Pd surface concentration of
56%. Concerning the Pd65Pt35 alloy, the nominal Pd concen-
tration is much higher and the calculations have shown that
the surface is almost entirely covered by Pd atoms whatever
the size of the clusters. This system illustrates the surface

mixing and it has been shown (20) that the large Pd surface
segregation is associated with a Pd depletion in the second
atomic layer.
Toluene Hydrogenation
A preliminary remark is that the turnover frequencies
measured on our model Pt and Pd catalysts are consistent
with the values reported in the literature (15, 16) for the ac-
tivities of γ -Al2O3-supported Pd and Pt catalysts, prepared
by the incipient wetness technique.
Secondly, as the Pd content increases, the TOF decreases
and the maximum of activity shifts to higher temperature.
This maximum occurs at Tmax equal to 450, 456, 472, and
473 K on Pt, Pd17Pt83, Pd65Pt35, and Pd, respectively. Such
a maximum has also been observed in the case of benzene
(21, 22) and toluene (15, 22) hydrogenation over Pd and Pt
supported catalysts. More precisely, in the case of benzene
hydrogenation, a maximum of activity occurring at 473 K
on Pt compared to 495 K on Pd (21) has been reported.
This maximum is apparently not associated with thermody-
namic equilibrium limitations, since the rate of the reverse
reaction becomes appreciable only at higher temperature.
This maximum has been explained by assuming either a de-
crease of the surface coverage by aromatics at high temper-
ature (18) or the formation of hydrogen-deﬁcient surface
carbonaceous species resulting from a dehydrogenation of
the aromatics (23). These hypotheses will be discussed later.
A comparison of the results obtained with the four systems
(Table 2) shows that the kinetics of toluene hydrogenation
is rather similar on the pure metals and on the alloys. This
similarity suggests that, at least for the rate-determining
step, the same reaction mechanism occurs, even if the max-
imum activity of Pt is 19 times that of pure Pd. We also note
that the activity curves of the pure Pd and Pd65Pt35 Catalysts
are almost superimposed. However, even if the surfaces of
both catalysts are entirely covered by Pd atoms, we have to
keep in mind that for the Pd65Pt35 system, the Pd surface
atoms are surrounded by Pt atoms located in the underlying
layer. Hence, the nearly similar activities of these catalysts
lead us to the conclusion that neighboring Pt atoms have no
inﬂuence on the reactivity of Pd atoms. This rules out the
assumption of electronic effects between these elements, as
postulated by several authors (2, 24). The hydrogenation of
toluene is considered to be structure insensitive, implying
that the active site is composed of a small number of atoms.
The effect of an inert or a slightly active diluent on the ac-
tivity can be predicted, once the size of the active site has
been determined.
To gain some insight into the structure of this site, one
mustﬁrsttakeintoaccountthefactthattheseelementsform
a nearly regular solid solution, with a low heat of mixing
and no ordered phase, over the whole concentration range
(25). In this disordered system, the distribution of the atoms
is simply governed by the statistics. Figure 11 displays the
expected TOF at 400 K based on an ensemble of n Pd atoms
or n Pt atoms and represented at a given temperature by
A = APdXn + APt(1 −X)n
where X is the palladium surface concentration and APd
and APt are respectively the activities of pure Pd and Pt.
Thisequationalsoimplicitlyassumesthatmixedsites,which
would have a reactivity different from that resulting from
pure additivity of the elements, are not considered. The ex-
perimental activity of the Pd17Pt83 alloy follows a TOF ver-
sus Pd surface concentration curve corresponding to n = 2
atoms. Such an active-site size has been already postulated
by Cadenhead and Masse (26), who studied benzene hydro-
genation over Pd–Au alloy, whereas Leon and Vannice (27)
determined a value of n = 3 for the benzene hydrogenation
over Pd–Cu supported catalysts. One can also wonder if
the active site can be described by two adjacent atoms over

However, as the temperature increases, a discrepancy arises
and we even observe that the activity of the alloy becomes
greater than that expected with n = 1. This paradoxical be-
havior should be related to the existence of a maximum in
the activity (Fig. 7).

their comparative TDS study of the adsorption of benzene
and toluene on Pt, Abon et al. (28) found a single and sim-
ilar π adsorption mode for benzene and toluene, but with
a much stronger bonding for the second molecule. More-
over, they observed that the adsorbed toluene is nearly
completely dehydrogenated during the thermodesorption,
whereas only half of the benzene desorbs dissociatively. Fi-
nally, they have also shown that toluene is thermally dehy-
drogenated 50 K below benzene. In spite of this difference,
Orozco and Webb (22) in their study of the hydrogena-
tion of a mixture of toluene and benzene on Pd/Al2O3 and
Pt/Al2O3 found that, for both catalysts, the maximum in the
activity–temperature curves is located at the same temper-
ature for the two molecules.
All these observations suggest that the maxium in the
activity curves cannot be related to the desorption or the
dehydrogenation of the aromatics. Indeed, it would be dif-
ﬁcult to understand how such aromatics with different ad-
sorption properties would give rise to the same temperature
maximum on both catalysts. So, one has to consider alter-
natively the possibility that this maximum is governed by
the desorption of the hydrogen. If one compares the results
of Conrad et al. (29) and Christmann et al. (30), who stud-
ied respectively the adsorption and desorption of H2 on Pd
and Pt single crystals, it should be noticed that the desorp-
tion peak of the hydrogen on Pd appears at a temperature
slightly higher than on Pt. This agrees, at least qualitatively,
with the fact that the maximum observed in the activity of
Pd is located at a higher temperature than on Pt. Hence, in
thecourseofthereactionathightemperature,thehydrogen
could be supplied by the Pd on the alloy, the hydrogenation
taking place to a large extent on Pt. This would explain
the synergy between Pd and Pt observed at high tempera-
ture (Fig. 12) for Pd17Pt83, the only catalyst whose surface
is composed of a mixed layer.
CONCLUSION
The laser vaporization technique has proven to be a
unique way to obtain bimetallic clusters with a remark-
ably uniform composition. A simple explanation for this
uniformity lies in the fact that the clusters are already
formed before the deposition, whereas in chemical meth-
ods the composition is governed by the respective afﬁnity
of the precursors for the support. It constitutes a precious
tool to investigate the effect of alloying on the reactivity,

independently of any possible support effect. Moreover, it
is, in principle, adapted to obtain bimetallic catalysts with
all kinds of alloys, even with nonmiscible metals like Au–
Ni (19) or Ag–Ni (31). In the hydrogenation of toluene, the
results concerning the pure metals are in agreement with
those of the literature. On the bimetallic catalysts, we have
demonstrated that no synergy between the two elements
can be evidenced, the rates being perfectly explained by an
additivity of the properties of the two metals. The nonlinear
dependence of the rate as a function of the Pt surface con-
centration is interpreted by the presence of an adsorption
site for the aromatic molecule composed of a pair of atoms.
Moreover, we have shown, with the study of the Pd65Pt35
sample, which contains nearly 100% Pd in the ﬁrst layer,
that the neighboring Pt atoms have no inﬂuence on the re-
activity of Pd. This rules out the assumption of an electronic
effect between these elements, a phenomenon postulated
by several authors (2, 5, 24) but never demonstrated exper-
imentally.
The behavior of the Pd17Pt83 bimetallic system at high
temperature, which shows a cooperative effect between Pd
and Pt, is interpreted by the ability of Pd to supply hydrogen
in sufﬁcient amount, whereas the aromatics remain more
strongly bonded on platinum.
Finally, the possibility of obtaining well-tailored sup-
ported particles will be used in the near future to study in
detail the resistance to sulfur poisoning of the Pd–Pt system
as a function of the composition.
