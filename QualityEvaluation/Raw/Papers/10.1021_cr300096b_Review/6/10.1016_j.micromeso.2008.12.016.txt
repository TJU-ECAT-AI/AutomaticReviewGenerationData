Combined NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry and diffusometry were applied to characterize porous car-
bon materials. Pore space characterization in NMR cryoporometry is based on the measurement of melt-
ing point depression of the conﬁned liquids, whereas NMR relaxometry and diffusometry explore the
random motion of the molecules under conﬁnement by the pore space. We demonstrate compatibility
between the evidence of classical sorption experiments and NMR cryoporometry on pore size distribu-
tion. There is a distribution in both the nuclear magnetic relaxation rates and diffusion coefﬁcients. These
distributions have to be referred to heterogeneities in the pore space. Since they can only be observed if
their inﬂuence is not averaged out on the diffusion paths covered by the molecules during the respective
measurements, the spatial extension of the regions with structural differences (as evidenced by the dif-
ferences in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation of the probe molecules) may be estimated to be at
least of the order of 20 lm.

1. Introduction
Nanoporous carbon materials are used in a wide range of indus-
trial applications, including heterogeneous catalysis, separation,
storage of gases and ﬂuid puriﬁcation. These materials are charac-
terized by a complex porous network constituted of micropores
with pore width of less than 2 nm, mesopores with pore widths be-
tween 2 and 50 nm and macropores with pore width of greater
than 50 nm. Such a three-dimensional pore structure results in a
material that exhibits a high surface area together with a high pore
volume. Additionally, carbon materials can accommodate hetero-
atoms (mainly oxygen surface groups) on structural defects (e.g.
boundaries of the graphene layer) which affect the surface chemis-
try of the material. A main advantage of porous carbons in respect
to other porous solids is that, both the porous structure and the
surface chemistry can be tailored by pre- and post-synthesis treat-
ments. This helps to achieve the properties required for a particular
application [1].
The proportion of micropores and mesopores on carbon materi-
als strongly depends on the synthesis procedure used. Microporous
carbons can be prepared from a wide variety of lignocellulosic pre-
cursors (olive stones, coconut shell, etc.) using either physical (CO2,
H2O, etc.) or chemical (H3PO4, ZnCl2, etc.) activation [2–4].
Although the presence of microporosity is required to achieve a
high surface area, i.e. a high adsorption capacity, the presence of
some mesoporosity is quite often desirable. Mesopores are very
useful, not only for processes involving larger molecules, but also
because they constitute channels for speeding up the access to
the inner microporosity. Carbon materials with a highly developed
mesoporosity can be prepared using different approaches, such as
combination of chemical and physical activation, use of nanocast-
ing (hard and soft template strategy) technology, etc. [5–7].
Textural characterization of nanoporous carbon materials is
commonly performed using adsorption of probe molecules (He,
Ar, N2, CO2, etc.). Among them, N2 adsorption at 77 K and CO2
adsorption at 273 K are the most widely used to assess both the to-
tal microporosity (<2 nm) and the narrow microporosity (<0.7 nm),
respectively [8]. Additionally, application of several mathematical
models to the adsorption isotherms can provide information about
the ‘‘apparent” surface area, pore size distribution, etc. (e.g. Bru-
nauer–Emmett–Teller equation to the N2 adsorption isotherm).
Although the correct characterization of the textural properties is
of paramount importance to understand the behaviour of carbon
materials in a certain application, their effectiveness in adsorption
processes will also be highly depending on the transport (diffusion)
of adsorptives to the inner pore system.
NMR methods have proven to be an efﬁcient tool to study mi-
cro- and mesoporous materials and surface interactions of con-
ﬁned liquids [9]. A combination of several NMR techniques is
especially useful as it allows for elucidation of a multitude of
important system characteristics. As an example, the properties

of sorbate molecules in contact with the liquid/solid interfaces at
pore walls were studied with the help of NMR cryoporometry
and relaxometry [10,11]. NMR cryoporometry provides informa-
tion on the distribution of the pore size. NMR relaxometry is espe-
cially sensitive to surface interactions. The aim of this work is the
characterization of mesoporous carbons by combination of the
three NMR techniques: cryoporometry, relaxometry and diffusom-
etry. Various adsorptive molecules were used for this study. One of
the accents was put on monitoring molecular transport of the con-
ﬁned liquids in the porous space of the investigated materials. Di-
rect measurements of molecular self-diffusion were performed
with the help of Pulsed Field Gradient (PFG) NMR permitting one
to obtain an in-depth information on both transport properties of
the conﬁned liquids and the structure characteristics of the host
material.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Two carbon molecular sieves (Takeda 4A and Takeda 5A, Takeda
Chemical Industries Ltd.) and three different activated carbons
(PK13, RGC30 and MAC-LMA12) have been used in this study.
The selection of these samples is based on their different textural
properties. While carbon molecular sieves and the activated carbon
PK13 (Norit) are mainly microporous, the samples RGC30 (Nuchar)
and MAC-LMA12 exhibit both micro- and mesoporosity.
Carbon molecular sieves Takeda 4A and Takeda 5A and acti-
vated carbons PK13 and RGC30 are commercially available carbon
materials. Sample MAC-LMA12 (MAC: mesoporous activated car-
bon; LMA: Laboratorio de Materiales Avanzados; x = 12: produc-
tion number) was prepared from olive stones as a raw material.
Firstly, the olive stones were crashed, sieved to 3 mm and washed
with diluted H2SO4 (10%) to remove the majority of inorganic
impurities. The clean sample was impregnated with an aqueous
solution of CaCl2 (7 wt.%) for 7 h in a thermostatic water bath at
358 K. After 7 h, the temperature was increased up to 373 K and
held at this temperature until the level of water became similar
to that of olive stone, the remaining water being removed by ﬁltra-
tion. The impregnated sample was dried for 24 h at 353 K in an air
recirculation oven and then it was submitted to an activation treat-
ment in a horizontal furnace using CO2 (100 ml min1) at 1043 K
for 6 h. After the activation, the sample was outgassed in a vacuum
oven for 4 h at 323 K, in order to remove the remaining CO2 ad-
sorbed, and subsequently washed with hot HCl (5%) in order to re-
move the remaining calcium; a ﬁnal washing with distilled water
until pH 7 was performed.
In order to avoid interferences in the diffusion process from
inorganic species remaining on the carbon structure, all carbon
materials have been washed with HCl (10%) at 353 K for 3 h. After
the acid treatment, carbon samples have been washed with dis-
tilled water until pH 7 and subsequently dried overnight at
353 K. After the washing treatment, the total ash content is mainly
nil for RGC30, MAC-LMA12, Takeda 4A and Takeda 5A samples,
while it is around 2 wt.% for sample PK13.
2.2. Sample characterization
N2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms were determined in a Coulter
Omnisorb-610 equipment at 77 K and 273 K, respectively. Prior to
the adsorption measurement, samples were outgassed under vac-
uum (103 Pa) at 523 K for 4 h. Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) equa-
tion was applied to the N2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms in order
to obtain both the total micropore volume (V0) and the volume
of narrow microporosity (Vn), respectively [12]. Total pore volume
(Vt) was obtained from the amount adsorbed at P/P0  0.99 on the
N2 isotherm, while the mesopore volume (Vmeso) was calculated
from the difference between Vt and V0. The ‘‘apparent” surface area
(SBET) was determined applying the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) equation to the N2 adsorption isotherms.
2.3. NMR analysis
All NMR measurements were performed with the help of the
home-built PFG NMR spectrometer FEGRIS NT, operating at a 1H
resonance frequency of 125 MHz [13]. High-intensity magnetic
ﬁeld gradients (up to 35 Tm1) were applied.
The construction of the melting curves in the experiments on
NMR cryoporometry was based on the temperature dependences
of the NMR signal intensity. The latter was evaluated as the maxi-
mal spin-echo amplitude produced by the standard Hahn echo
radio frequency pulse sequence (90–s–180). The value of s was
set to 2 ms. All measured echo amplitudes were normalized by
the value of the (echo) amplitude at the highest temperature
(above the bulk melting point). The range of investigated temper-
atures was between 165 K and 298 K. The experiments were
started at the lowest temperature and then the temperature was
increased in steps of 5 K. The relaxation rates of the adsorbate mol-
ecules in the investigated samples were determined using the
Carr–Purcell–Mejboom–Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence. The measure-
ment of diffusion coefﬁcients in PFG NMR was performed with the
help of the standard three 90- pulse sequence (also known as the
‘‘stimulated echo” pulse sequence).
The preparation of the samples for the NMR experiments was
performed as follows. The host material was introduced into the
sample tubes with an outer diameter of 7.5 mm. After that, the
tubes with the material were heated at 383 K during 24 h in an
oven under atmospheric conditions. Then the samples were con-
nected to the vacuum system and dehydrated under high vacuum
(<102 Pa) at 523 K for around 4 h. While evacuating, a certain
amount of liquid was injected into the tubes. For relaxation and
diffusion experiments, the amount of the sorbate was adjusted to
achieve full loading of the pores (100% of the total pore volume).
For the NMR cryoporometry experiments, the amount of sorbate
(nitrobenzene in our work) was supplied in excess, thus allowing
an oversaturation of the host material. Finally, the sample tubes
were sealed.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Textural characterization
Fig. 1 shows the N2 adsorption isotherms for the different sam-
ples studied. As it can be observed, all carbon materials exhibit a
high nitrogen uptake at low relative pressures (P/P0 < 0.01), which
mainly corresponds to the adsorption on micropores. After the
sharp knee in the N2 isotherms, samples PK13 and MAC-LMA12 ex-
hibit a near-plateau with a small slope but, above P/P0  0.6, the
sample MAC-LMA12 exhibits an important increase in the amount
adsorbed and a hysteresis loop suggesting the additional presence
of some mesoporosity. The situation becomes different for sample
Nuchar RGC30. This activated carbon exhibits a continuous in-
crease in the amount adsorbed over the whole relative pressure
range (up to P/P0 = 0.97), which corresponds to the combined pres-
ence of microporosity together with a well-developed mesoporos-
ity. These ﬁndings are clearly reﬂected on Table 1. The micropore
volume obtained from the N2 (V0) and CO2 (Vn) adsorption iso-
therms for sample Norit PK13 is quite similar, thus reﬂecting the
presence of a narrow micropore size distribution on this sample
[14]. This difference between V0 and Vn becomes slightly more evi-
92

dent for the synthesized activated carbon, denoted MAC-LMA12, in
which the total pore volume is constituted by about 70% mesop-
ores and 30% micropores. Last but not least, sample RGC30 exhibits
very different values for V0 and Vn, which conﬁrms the presence of
a broad micropore size distribution with combination of both
micropores and mesopores (the proportion of narrow micropores
being less important than for the other carbons).
As it has been mentioned before, carbon molecular sieves Tak-
eda 4A and Takeda 5A have been also considered for this study
due to the pure microporous nature of these samples (more than
90% of the pore volume is in the range of microporosity), with
the mesopore volume in these materials being almost nil [15].
The micropore volume (V0) obtained from N2 adsorption isotherms
at 77 K is 0.22 cm3 g1 and 0.33 cm3 g1, for samples Takeda 4A
and Takeda 5A, respectively. The two carbon molecular sieves Tak-
eda 4A and Takeda 5A differentiate from each other by the size of
the mouth in the microporous space: 0.4 and 0.5 nm, respectively
[1].
3.2. NMR cryoporometry
NMR cryoporometry exploits the melting point depression of
liquids conﬁned in mesopores [16]. The melting temperature Tm
of a liquid frozen in pores is lower than that of a bulk liquid as a
consequence of the smaller crystal sizes and the enhanced sur-
face-to-volume ratio. This effect is larger for smaller pores. Accord-
ing to the Gibbs–Thomson equation [17] the difference between
the normal (bulk) and the depressed melting points (in pores) is in-
versely proportional to the pore diameter d
DTmðdÞ ¼ Tm  TmðdÞ ¼ k=d;
ð1Þ
where k is a constant related to the thermodynamic properties of
the conﬁned liquid. In materials with a distribution of pore diame-
ters, the melting temperature of the conﬁned liquid will vary with
the pore size. In NMR cryoporometry, one only observes the NMR
signal due to the molecules in the liquid state. Therefore, at each
temperature below the bulk melting point, the measured signal
intensity is proportional to the volume of the non-frozen liquid con-
ﬁned in the pores. Analyzing the NMR response as a function of the
temperature permits to determine the distribution of the pore sizes
using the
Dt
Dd ¼
kDt
DTmðdÞd
2
ð2Þ
where t is the total volume of pores with diameters 6 d. Hence, Dt
Dd is
nothing else than the pore size distribution, which, owing to Eq. (2),
becomes directly experimentally accessible. The parameter k should
be known (or calibrated) in advance. This method is limited to pore
sizes exceeding 1 nm and is efﬁcient in characterizing the pores on
the mesoscopic length scale.
The transverse nuclear magnetic relaxation of guest molecules
within the micropores was typically small (62 ms) so that the con-
tribution of these molecules to the observed NMR signal could be
neglected. It is, therefore, exclusively the size distribution of the
mesopores which is traced in our present cryoporometry studies.
In this work, the so-called melting curves, i.e. the temperature
dependences of the NMR signal intensity, were measured for nitro-
benzene conﬁned in MAC-LMA12, Nuchar RGC30 and Norit PK13.
Fig. 2 shows the melting curves of all three samples in the range
of temperatures between 165 K and 298 K. The bulk melting point
of nitrobenzene at 279 K is indicated as the vertical line. A step-like
decrease in the vicinity of this temperature observed for all three
samples is attributed to the bulk liquid component (outside the
pores). Obviously, in sample MAC-LMA12 this decay merges with
the decay in large mesopores and macropores which introduces a
large uncertainty in pore size distribution resulting from this part
of the melting curve. For two samples, MAC-LMA12 and RGC30, a
change of the signal intensity was also observed at lower temper-
atures, i.e. below the bulk step. This change refers to melting of
nitrobenzene conﬁned in the mesoporous space of these materials.

In Norit PK13, melting in the mesopores was not observed. This
indicates that the mesoporous volume in PK13 is small in compar-
ison to the other two samples; in agreement with the adsorption
results (see Table 1).
The pore size distributions of RGC30 and MAC-LMA12 calcu-
lated from the melting curves are shown in Fig. 3. The mean pore
diameters could roughly be estimated from the peaks of the distri-
bution functions as 2 nm and 7 nm for MAC-LMA12 and RGC30
samples, respectively. Fig. 3 shows that the distribution around
these values is broader for RGC30 than for MAC-LMA12. In the lat-
ter sample, there is an additional broad peak centered at around
15 nm. It corresponds to the ﬁrst steep decay in the melting curves,
close to the bulk melting point. Due to the limited resolution in this
range of our melting curve, this peak does only indicate the pres-
ence of some larger mesopores and macropores and is not suitable
for quantitative analysis.
3.3. NMR relaxometry
In addition to NMR cryoporometry which is sensitive to pore
space geometry, NMR relaxometry can provide valuable informa-
tion on molecular dynamics of the conﬁned liquid and on surface
interactions. The adsorbate molecules probe the pore structure
and surfaces via translational diffusion between the surface sites
and the internal volume of the pore. In the vicinity of the solid sur-
face, the transverse relaxation time T2 of a liquid tends to decrease
in comparison to the bulk state. The decrease is the larger the
stronger is the surface interaction and is usually more pronounced
for polar liquids. In pores with characteristic sizes of a few or a few
tens of nanometers the exchange between the surface sites and the
pore interior is fast on the time scale of the NMR experiment. The
measured transverse relaxation rate T1
2
of a liquid in the mesop-
ores, therefore, will represent an average of the bulk-like liquid
relaxation rate T1
2;bulk and the enhanced surface relaxation rate,
weighted according to the surface-to-volume ratio of the pore.

where S/V is the surface-to-volume ratio and q is the surface relax-

(surface relaxivity). The amplitude of the transverse magnetization

In our experiments, it was evaluated from a series of spin echoes

the contributions of the individual pores [20]

Typically, the transverse relaxation time of a bulk liquid (seconds) is
much larger than that of a liquid near the pore wall (milliseconds or
below). Therefore, the measured relaxation rate in Eq. (3) is deter-
mined solely by the second term. Provided the distribution of relax-
ivities fðT1
2 Þ is due to distribution of the pore sizes only, the latter
can be deduced from the measured relaxation function, Eq. (5). This
was demonstrated, for example, for a series of silica gels in Ref. [11].
Fig. 4 shows the attenuations of transverse magnetization of
ethanol, nitrobenzene and toluene in MAC-LMA12 as a function
of time. Deviations from the exponential behaviour were observed.

where WfastðtÞ refers to the ‘‘fast” attenuation component visible at
short times, see incept in Fig. 4. This component is relevant for a
quite small fraction of molecules (10–20%) and, therefore, cannot
be analysed in more detail as it is masked by the dominating
‘‘slower” component. The latter refers to 80–90% of molecules and
exhibits a moderate deviation from the exponential behaviour.
The existence of two components in the relaxation curves indicates
the presence of two species of molecules with different dynamic
properties. The species with the faster relaxation and smaller pop-
ulation should probably be attributed to the liquid conﬁned in the
microporous space. The larger fraction with slower relaxation
should then be attributed to the liquid in the mesopores. It is worth
noting that the exchange between the two species is hindered. This

is in spite of the large diffusion path lengths of more than 100 nm,
notably exceeding the pore sizes. In turn, this should mean that as
soon as the molecules enter the microporous space (or some spe-
ciﬁc areas of this space) they tend to stay in this space and not eas-
ily exchange with the molecules in the mesopores.
The mean relaxation rates were determined from the initial
slopes of the slow components of the relaxation curves according
to Eq. (4). The corresponding inverse values, 1=hT1
2 i, for toluene,
ethanol and nitrobenzene were 10 ms, 7 ms and 6 ms, respectively.
The fact that the relaxation times of ethanol and nitrobenzene
were shorter than in toluene correlates with the much stronger
polarity of these liquids in comparison with toluene. This is due
to the stronger surface interactions of polar molecules giving rise
to enhanced relaxivity at the surface and, hence, to shorter overall
transverse relaxation times [11].
PFG NMR diffusion studies reveal molecular displacements of
order of micrometers during the experimental observation times
(see Section 3.4). Therefore, a non-exponential relaxation behav-
iour can only be observed if the sample consists of sub-regions of
different pore characteristics (e.g. mean pore sizes) with exten-
sions over at least tens of micrometers.
The analysis of the molecular dynamics in the microporous
space of the MAC-LMA12 material was approached by separate
studies of the microporous carbon materials Takeda 4A and Takeda
5A. The relaxation curves of ethanol and toluene in these materials
are shown in Fig. 5. Only slight deviations from the exponential
behaviour are observed. The relaxation times (obtained as the in-
verse values of the mean relaxation rates, 1=hT1
2 i) were 1.2 ms
and 2 ms for ethanol, and 0.5 ms and 0.8 ms for toluene in Takeda
4A and Takeda 5A, respectively. Again the trends in the relaxation
rates exhibit the expected behaviour. The relaxation times become
the smaller, the more rigid are the formed guest-host complexes:
both an increase in the guest size (from ethanol to toluene) and
a decrease in the host ‘‘cage” size (from Takeda 5A to Takeda 4A;
in parallel with an enhancement of the surface-to-volume ratio)
lead to slower relaxation times.
3.4. NMR diffusometry
The PFG NMR technique provides information about the pore
structure via the transport properties of the adsorbed molecules.
The attenuation of the NMR signal is related to the ‘‘propagator”
P(x,t) (the probability distribution of molecular displacements
along the axis of gradient direction x during the time t) according to

where f(D) denotes the distribution function of diffusivities, i.e. the
probability that the diffusion path of an arbitrary selected mole-
cules during the observation time may be characterized by a diffu-
sivity D. Depending on the size of the regions within the samples, to
which these different diffusivities may be attributed, this distribu-
tion may be a function of the observation time, tending to become
smaller with increasing observation time. The mean diffusivity hDi

In this work, we investigated the diffusion of several liquids con-

nitrobenzene, acetone and n-decane. As an example, Fig. 6 shows
the diffusion attenuation curve for ethanol at 298 K. The observed
behaviour is typical of all liquids considered. It exhibits a clear devi-

slow component are normalized as R fðDÞdD þ fslow ¼ 1). The values
of fslow and Dslow, as evaluated from the ﬁts of the exponential func-
tion to the slow component of the curve in Fig. 6, were 0.062 and
4  1013 m2 s1.
The two constituents of the diffusion attenuation indicate that,
over the observation time, the molecules exist in essentially two
different dynamical states, as observed already above in context
of nuclear magnetic relaxation. Again, we attribute the smaller
fraction with the smaller diffusivities to molecules conﬁned in
the micropores and the dominating fraction with the larger diffu-
sivities to the liquid in the mesopore space.
The faster attenuating component, obtained after subtraction of
the slow component from the total attenuation is shown in the in-
set, Fig. 6. It exhibits a clear deviation from the exponential depen-
dence, thus indicating a distribution of diffusivities as incorporated
by the ﬁrst term in Eq. (14). The mean diffusion coefﬁcient hDi
referring to the fast component was determined from the initial
slope. It equals approximately 1.7  109 m2 s1 and thus is four
orders of magnitude larger than Dslow.
The slow diffusion component is to be compared with the diffu-
sion behaviour of the same liquid in the microporous Takeda sam-
ples. Fig. 7 shows the diffusion attenuation curves of ethanol in
Takeda 4A and Takeda 5A at 298 K. In Takeda 5A, the attenuation
curves were exponential over the covered range of more than
one order of magnitude. In Takeda 4A, the signal intensity was so
small (as a consequence of the fast transverse relaxation) so that
the data points could be measured only in a limited range, not be-
low 50% of the initial amplitude. In this range, the observed atten-
uations were exponential as well. The diffusion coefﬁcient of
ethanol in Takeda 5A, evaluated from the exponential ﬁts to the
data points, was 8  1012 m2 s1. In Takeda 4A, the evaluated dif-
fusivity was 9  1013 m2 s1, nearly one order of the magnitude
smaller than in Takeda 5A. This ﬁnding complies with the shorter
relaxation time observed in Takeda 4A and quantiﬁes the effect
of the more severe restriction to diffusion due to the smaller pores
in this material, as compared with Takeda 5A.
Fig. 8 shows the diffusion attenuation curves of toluene in MAC-
LMA12 for various observation times in the range between 10 ms
and 300 ms. No time dependence of the attenuations was observed
for both the slow and fast (see inset) components. The molecular
displacements monitored in our experiments were between
60 nm for the slower component and 23 lm for the faster compo-
nent. On the one hand, the absence of the time dependence indi-
cates that there is practically no exchange between the two
different species as it was suggested on the basis of the relaxation
studies. On the other hand, it provides evidence that the mesop-
ores in MAC-LMA12 represent a well interconnected space, rather
than a system of closed separated pores. In the latter case one
would have to expect a decrease of the curve slopes with increas-
ing observation times.
The diffusion behaviour of several liquids (acetone, ethanol, tol-
uene, n-decane and nitrobenzene) conﬁned in MAC-LMA12 was
compared. Table 2 provides the comparison of the resulting mean
diffusivities Dsorbate with the bulk diffusivities of these liquids
Dliquid. Depending on the particular guest, the diffusivities within
the pore system are found to be both larger and smaller than the
bulk diffusivities. This ﬁnding may be related to the fact that due
to the presence of the host lattice, guest diffusion may occur both
in a liquid (phase 1) attached to the pore system and through the
free space (phase 2). With the respective relative amounts of mol-
ecules pi and diffusivities Di, the mean diffusivity as accessible by
PFG NMR will result to be [22]
Dsorbate ¼ p1D1 þ p2D2
ð15Þ
The diffusivity D1 in the free space, following gas-phase or Knudsen
diffusion [9,22], is notably larger and the diffusivity D2 in the liquid
phase, due to the tortuosity of the pore space, is smaller than the
diffusivity Dliquid in the bulk phase. Thus, depending on the relative
contributions p1 and p2, Dsorbate may in fact assume larger or smaller
values than Dliquid. The magnitude of p1 increases in proportion with
the vapor phase pressure and, hence, also the contribution of the
ﬁrst term in Eq. (15). Hence, it is in complete agreement with our
Fig. 7. Diffusion attenuation curves of ethanol in Takeda 4A and Takeda 5A at
298 K. The observation time was equal to 10 ms.

component obtained after subtracting the slow component from the total atten-
uation curve. The observation time was 10 ms.

understanding that, as shown in Table 2, a decrease in the boiling
point (which corresponds to a decrease in the vapor pressure at a
given temperature) is accompanied with a decrease in Dsorbate.
The latter, according to Eq. (15), reﬂects a decrease in p1, i.e. in
the contribution of the fast (gas-phase) mode of molecular
propagation.
4. Conclusions
Carbon materials containing different proportions of micro- and
mesoporosity were studied. The combination of different NMR
methods was used to explore the pore structure and the interac-
tion of the adsorbate with the pore walls. Pore size distribution
in samples RGC30 and MAC-LMA12 was determined by NMR cry-
oporometry. In MAC-LMA12, a narrow pore size distribution was
observed, with a mean pore size of about 2 nm; RGC30 sample
has a broad pore size distribution, centered around a mean pore
size of about 7 nm. These two values reﬂect the differences ob-
served in the N2 (77 K) and CO2 (273 K) adsorption isotherms.
In microporous Takeda 4A, the sorbate relaxation rates were
larger and the diffusivities smaller than in Takeda 5A. This evi-
dences that sorbate molecule in Takeda 4A experience stronger
restrictions in both their re-orientational and translational motions
than in Takeda 5A, as a consequence of the smaller pore size of
Takeda 4A. In MAC-LMA12, two molecular species with different
relaxation and diffusion properties were observed. The dominating
part of molecules conﬁned in MAC-LMA12 exhibited much smaller
relaxation rates and larger diffusivities than in Takeda samples.
This is attributed to the presence of mesopores which tend to con-
ﬁne the dominating part of the liquid. Besides, diffusion experi-
ments showed the existence of the quite broad distribution of
the diffusivities. This is attributed to heterogeneities of the mate-
rial on length scales notably exceeding the characteristic molecular
displacements (in the range of micrometers).
