Abstract
Using FePtAu nanoparticles (NPs) as an example, this Communication demonstrates a new structure-control strategy to tune and optimize NP catalysis. The presence of Au in FePtAu facilitates FePt structure transformation from chemically disordered face-centered cubic (fcc) structure to chemically ordered face-centered tetragonal (fct) structure, and further promotes formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR). The fct-FePtAu NPs have mass activity as high as 2809.9 mA/mg Pt and retain 92.5% of this activity after a 13 h stability test. They become the most efficient NP catalyst ever reported for FAOR. This structure-control strategy can be extended to other multimetallic NP systems, providing a general approach to advanced NP catalysts with desired activity and durability control for practical applications.

Recent advances in nanoparticle (NP) synthetic methodology have led to the formation of various monodisperse metallic NPs with ever-increasing activity to catalyze oxidation of fuel (hydrogen, formic acid, or alcohol) and reduction of oxygen in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell conditions. (1-3) Among all the NPs studied, Pt and its alloy NPs have constantly been the catalysts of choice due to their high activity for fuel oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). (4-12) However, these Pt-based NPs have shown serious limitations in their fuel cell catalysis: they are unstable in the corrosive electrochemical environment and prone to deactivation by reaction intermediate species such as carbon monoxide. (13) As a result, NP catalysts based on elemental Pt and composition-controlled Pt-alloys are far from optimized for fuel cell applications. Very recently, core/shell-type NPs with a thin (<2 nm), uniform coating of Pt-shell were prepared and demonstrated to be a robust class of catalyst for ORR. (14-16) Despite this progress, there is still no reliable approach to NP catalysts with simultaneous enhancement in both activity and durability for practical fuel oxidation reactions.
This Communication presents a new structure-control strategy to tune and optimize NP catalysis for fuel oxidations. NPs, especially multimetallic NPs, can adopt different crystal structures. For example, as synthesized from a high-temperature solution-phase reaction, monodisperse binary FePt NPs have the chemically disordered face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, in which Fe and Pt atoms occupy randomly the fcc crystal lattice. (17) When further annealed, the fcc structure can be converted into the chemically ordered face-centered tetragonal (fct) structure, in which Fe and Pt atoms form alternating atomic layers stacked along one specific direction. (17) Such a structure conversion in FePt can result in a drastic magnetic property change from superparamagnetism to ferromagnetism (18) and in chemical stability increase in acid solutions. (19) It is this chemical stability increase in fct-FePt that led to the current work to explore structure-induced NP catalysis for electrooxidation reactions with simultaneous enhancement in both activity and durability. The catalyst described here is monodisperse trimetallic FePtAu NPs. The presence of Au in FePtAu facilitates FePt structural transformation from fcc to fct, with Au segregating on the fct-FePt surface, and further promotes formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR)—the anode reaction that is used to power direct formic acid fuel cells. (20) Compared to Pt and FePt NPs catalysts, the fct-FePtAu NPs show high CO poisoning-resistance, achieve mass activity of 2809.9 mA/mg Pt, and retain 92.5% of this activity after a 13 h stability test. They become the most active and durable catalyst ever reported for FAOR.
FePtAu NPs were synthesized by co-reduction of platinum acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) and chloroauric acid hydrate (HAuCl4·xH2O) and thermal decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5) (Supporting Information). In the synthesis, excess Fe(CO)5 was added to function both as a reducing agent and as a Fe precursor for its alloying with Pt and Au. Oleylamine and tetradecylphosphonic acid were used to stabilize the NPs. FePtAu compositions were controlled by varying the molar ratios of Pt(acac)2, HAuCl4·xH2O, and Fe(CO)5 and were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (Table S1). Also, 4 nm Fe55Pt45 NPs were synthesized similarly without the presence of Au salt. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the as-synthesized FePt and FePtAu NPs have an average size of 4 ± 0.2 nm for Fe55Pt45 (Figure S1), 4 ± 0.2 nm for Fe42Pt44Au14 (Figure S2A), 4 ± 0.2 nm for Fe43Pt37Au20 (Figure 1A), and 4 ± 0.3 nm for Fe34Pt34Au32 NPs (Figure S2B).

TEM images of (A) the as-synthesized 4 nm Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs, (B) the fcc-Fe43Pt37Au20/C NPs, (C) a representative fcc-Fe43Pt37Au20/C NP, (D) the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20/C NPs, and (E) a representative fct-Fe43Pt37Au20/C NP. The as-synthesized NPs were deposited on the amorphous carbon-coated Cu grid, and the other NPs were deposited on the Ketjen carbon support, and they were annealed under 95% Ar + 5% H2 at 400 °C (B,C) and 600 °C (D,E) for 1 h. (F) XRD patterns of the as-synthesized Fe55Pt45 NPs, Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs and the Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs annealed at 500 and 600 °C (stars denote the fct-FePt peaks), as well as the Fe34Pt34Au32 NPs annealed at 600 °C (arrows denote the Au peaks). The NPs were deposited on the Ketjen carbon support and annealed under 95% Ar + 5% H2 for 1 h.
FePt NPs are often synthesized by reduction of Pt(acac)2 and thermal decomposition of Fe(CO)5 in the presence of oleic acid and oleylamine. (17) This same recipe does not work for the current synthesis of FePtAu NPs with the desired size and Fe/Pt/Au composition controls. However, when oleic acid is replaced by tetradecylphosphonic acid, co-reduction of Pt(acac)2 and HAuCl4 and decomposition of Fe(CO)5 yield monodisperse 4 nm FePtAu NPs with Fe/Pt/Au compositions readily controlled by the metal precursor ratios. In this work, the Fe/Pt ratio is kept near 1:1 to facilitate fcc–fct phase transformation, (17) while Au is made to have three different percentages so that the Au composition-dependent fcc–fct transition and Au-dependent FAOR catalysis can be studied.
High-temperature annealing was applied to remove the surfactants around NPs and to convert the fcc-FePtAu to fct-FePtAu. To prevent NPs from aggregation under these annealing conditions and to facilitate the catalytic studies, the as-synthesized NPs were deposited on Ketjen carbon (C) support before the annealing (Supporting Information). Figure 1B,C shows the typical TEM and high-resolution (HR) TEM images of the fcc-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs annealed under 95% Ar + 5% H2 at 400 °C for 1 h. The fcc-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs have an average size of 4 ± 0.2 nm and (111) lattice fringe distance at 0.23 nm. Upon annealing at 600 °C for 1 h, the fcc-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs are converted to fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs, as shown in the TEM and HRTEM images (Figure 1D,E) of the NPs. The NP morphology integrity observed in these TEM images indicates that the FePtAu NPs deposited on the carbon support are well-protected against aggregation/sintering during the high-temperature annealing treatments.
The structure transition of the FePt and FePtAu NPs was monitored by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the NPs deposited on C (Figure 1F). The as-synthesized Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs show a typical fcc pattern with broadened and small angle-shifted peaks compared to the 4 nm fcc-Fe55Pt45 NPs, suggesting that Au-doping in FePt induces the reduction of crystal coherence length and increase of crystal lattice spacing. When annealed at 400 and 500 °C for 1 h, the Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs remain fcc, but at 600 °C for 1 h, the fcc-Fe43Pt37Au20 is converted to partially ordered fct-Fe43Pt37Au20. Associated with this structure change, the 4 nm fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs become ferromagnetic and show a coercivity of ∼1000 Oe at room temperature, while the 4 nm Fe55Pt45 NPs annealed at the same temperature have a coercivity of only ∼300 Oe (Figure S3). (21) This indicates that Au segregation from the FePtAu structure helps to create lattice vacancies within the 4 nm FePtAu structure, promoting Fe/Pt rearrangement. This supports what has been proposed in Au doping effect on FePt structure transformation. (22, 23) Our studies further show that the fct structure formation within FePtAu is Au composition-dependent, with Au in 20% (by atomic percentage) range forming better chemical order within the FePt structure. Adding more Au to the FePtAu structure seems to have no benefit for fcc–fct transition, as the Fe34Pt34Au32 NPs annealed at 600 °C exhibit weaker/broader fct peaks than the Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs (Figure 1F).
The carbon-supported Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs annealed at 400 and 600 °C respectively were further characterized by atomically resolved aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), STEM-electron energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS), and STEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS). Figure 2A is the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) image of a representative fcc-Fe43Pt37Au20 NP, and Figure 2B–D shows the corresponding Fe elemental mapping of this NP using the STEM-EELS method. These analyses indicate that Fe in the fcc structure is uniformly distributed. In contrast, the HAADF image and the corresponding Fe elemental mapping of the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NP (Figure 2E–H) show that Fe is concentrated in the core region and Au/Pt are rich in the shell structure. The STEM-EDS line scans confirm that Au alloys uniformly with Fe and Pt in the fcc-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs (Figure 2I), but in the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 structure it diffuses out and concentrates around the shell (Figure 2J). Based on the STEM-EELS and STEM-EDS analyses, the annealing-induced structure change of FePtAu is illustrated in Figure 3. When annealed at 400 °C, the fcc structure is better formed in FePtAu NPs. At 600 °C, the fcc-FePtAu is converted to fct-FePtAu, with Au segregating on the FePt NP surface. (24) Such a unique structure pattern is essential for fct-FePtAu NPs to show the enhanced activity and durability for FAOR.

The Au composition effect of the 4 nm fct-FePtAu NPs on FAOR was first studied to obtain the optimum Au composition for further catalytic studies. Figure 4A and Figure S4A show the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of three different kinds of fct-FePtAu NPs in N2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The peaks appearing in the range from −0.25 to 0.15 V are attributed to hydrogen underpotential formation/stripping (HUPD) and are used to estimate the electrochemical active surface area of the NPs (Figure S4A). (25) The peaks at 0.3–0.9 V are from metal oxidation/reduction: more Au content in the NP structure leads to stronger Au reduction peaks at 0.80 V (Figure 4A). The electrooxidation activity of these fct-FePtAu NPs in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.5 M HCOOH is normalized against NP surface area and is plotted as current density (J) vs the applied potentials (V) (Figure 4B). For the fct-Fe42Pt44Au14 NPs, the first current maximum at 0.47 V in the forward scan is due to the direct oxidation of HCOOH to CO2 (dehydrogenation reaction), while the second current maximum at 0.71 V corresponds to oxidation of CO generated from the dehydration reaction of HCOOH. (11) The stability of these fct-FePtAu NPs was tested by chronoamperometry, as shown in the J change of FAOR over time (t) at 0.2 V (Figure S4B). (26) Among three different kinds of fct-FePAu NPs studied, the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs have the best long-term stability.

(D) J–V curves of the specific activity of the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20, fct-Fe55Pt45 and commercial Pt catalysts. (E) J–V curves of the mass activity of the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs. (F) J–V curves of the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs before and after a 13 h I–t stability test. The studies were performed in N2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 (for CV curves) and 0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.5 M HCOOH solutions (for J–V curves).
The effect of the structure of the Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs on FAOR catalysis was investigated. Figure S5 shows the CVs of the Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs annealed at different temperatures. With the increase in annealing temperatures from 400 to 600 °C, the Pt-based reduction peak potentials shift negatively, indicating the better Fe-alloy effect to Pt in fct-FePt than in fcc-FePt structure. The results of the FAOR catalyzed by the Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs annealed at different temperatures are shown in Figure 4C. The fcc-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs obtained from 400 °C annealing display an obvious CO oxidation peak at 0.7 V. Increasing the annealing temperature to 500 °C results in the intensity drop of this oxidation peak. The NPs annealed at 600 °C for 1 h show no CO oxidation peak, suggesting that the segregation of Au on the surface of the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs helps CO removal. The FAOR stability of the Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs annealed at different temperatures is shown in Figure S6. The Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs annealed at 600 °C are more stable for FAOR than any of the other two kinds of NPs treated at 400 and 500 °C, indicating once again that the fct structure favors the durability enhancement of FePtAu NPs for FAOR.
The fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs are much more active and durable catalysts for FAOR than the fct-Fe55Pt45 NPs and the commercial Pt NPs. Figure S7 and Figure 4D show the comparison of CVs and J–V curves, respectively, for these NPs. As expected, the Pt catalyst has a very strong CO oxidation peak at 0.67 V, whereas the fct-Fe55Pt45 shows a relatively weak peak at 0.69 V, and the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs have no CO oxidation peak. Without the CO-poisoning effect, the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs have an onset FAOR potential at −0.2 V, which is 0.12 V lower than that of the commercial Pt (−0.08 V). The mass activity of the 4 nm fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs reaches 2809.9 mA/mg Pt (Figure 4E), which is the highest among all NP catalysts ever reported. Furthermore, the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs are also the most stable NP catalysts for FOAR: their specific activity drops about 50% at the end of a 3 h J–t test (Figure S8). Even after a 13 h J–t test, their mass activity is still at 2600 mA/mg Pt (92.5% of the original value of 2809.9 mA/mg Pt) (Figure 4F). As a comparison, under the same measurement conditions, the state-of-art PtBi NPs have the mass activity of about 1720 mA/mg Pt and can keep only about 11% of their initial activity at the end of a 3 h J–t test. (11)
The fct-FePtAu structure with Au segregating on the FePt surface is essential for the NPs to show enhanced activity and durability for FAOR. With the increase of the Au amount to 20% and 32% in the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 and fct-Fe34Pt34Au32 NPs, respectively, the CO-related peak in FAOR disappears, indicating that Au on the NP surface promotes the dehydrogenation reaction of HCOOH and inhibits the dehydration reaction that leads to the formation of CO. It seems that Au helps to boost the formation of HCOOads and its spillover to Pt to facilitate the dehydrogenation pathway. (27) The enhanced stability likely comes from the formation of fct structure within fct-FePtAu NPs promoted by Au doping and segregation. Without the presence of Au and the formation of fct structure, Pt, FePt, and fcc-FePtAu NPs are all subject to easy CO poisoning and acid dissolution, exhibiting much lower activity and stability for FAOR than the fct-FePtAu NPs.
In summary, this Communication presents a new structure-control strategy to tune and optimize FePtAu NP catalysis for FAOR. These NPs are synthesized by a facile solution-phase process with their compositions controlled by the molar ratios of the metal precursors. The presence of Au in FePt facilitates the FePt structure transformation from fcc to fct and further promotes the FAOR in the H2SO4 solution. Among all Pt, FePt, and FePtAu NPs tested, the 4 nm fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs are the most active and durable catalyst: they have a mass activity of 2809.9 mA/mg Pt and retain 92.5% of this activity after 13 h stability test. The high CO-resistant activity of the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs is attributed to surface segregation of Au from the fct-FePt, while the high durability is the result of the formation of the fct structure promoted by Au-segregation within the FePtAu NPs. Our preliminary tests show that the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs are also active for catalyzing methanol oxidation reactions with a high CO-tolerance activity (Figure S9). The work demonstrates the great potentials of fct-FePtAu NPs as highly efficient catalysts for electrooxidation reactions of organic molecules. More importantly, the structure-control strategy is not limited to FePtAu NPs but can be extended to other M-doped FePtM (M = Cu, Ag, Sb, for example) (18) or Pt- and Pd-based multimetallic NPs, providing a general approach to advanced NP catalysts with simultaneous enhancement in both activity and durability for practical applications.

21Since these NPs are not magnetically saturated, the coercivity values measured from the hysteresis loops are the low-end numbers and are used only to demonstrate the FePt structure conversion. The coercivity values should be larger than the reported once these NPs are magnetically saturated under a stronger magnetic field.

24We should note that to achieve a complete fcc–fct transition within 4 nm FePtAu NPs is difficult, as the small NP size tends to restrict the Fe and Pt mobility unless even higher annealing temperate and longer annealing time are applied, which can cause carbon support degradation and FePtAu NP aggregation/sintering.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. TEM images of (A) the as-synthesized 4 nm Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs, (B) the fcc-Fe43Pt37Au20/C NPs, (C) a representative fcc-Fe43Pt37Au20/C NP, (D) the fct-Fe43Pt37Au20/C NPs, and (E) a representative fct-Fe43Pt37Au20/C NP. The as-synthesized NPs were deposited on the amorphous carbon-coated Cu grid, and the other NPs were deposited on the Ketjen carbon support, and they were annealed under 95% Ar + 5% H2 at 400 °C (B,C) and 600 °C (D,E) for 1 h. (F) XRD patterns of the as-synthesized Fe55Pt45 NPs, Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs and the Fe43Pt37Au20 NPs annealed at 500 and 600 °C (stars denote the fct-FePt peaks), as well as the Fe34Pt34Au32 NPs annealed at 600 °C (arrows denote the Au peaks). The NPs were deposited on the Ketjen carbon support and annealed under 95% Ar + 5% H2 for 1 h.
