Abstract
Platinum–Palladium supported on ceria catalysts has been studied for preferential oxidation of CO in the presence of hydrogen.
The catalysts were prepared by impregnation method using different supports. The catalytic activity tests were performed
using a ﬁxed bed reactor in the temperature range of 50.190 ◦C atmospheric pressure. Effects of support, ratio of Pt–Pd, O2
concentration water vapor concentration, CO2 concentration, and the combination of H2O and CO2 in the feed stream on the
catalytic performance of Pt–Pd/CeO2 catalysts were also investigated. The experimental results showed that 1% (1:7) Pt–Pd/CeO2
(sol–gel) exhibited higher activity than other catalysts examined. Water vapor in the feed substantially increased the activity of
the catalysts, whereas CO2 in the feed stream drastically decreased the activity of the catalysts. When both H2O and CO2 were
added in the feed stream, the positive effect of H2O is more pronounced than the negative effect of CO2.

1. Introduction
In the past decade, proton exchange membrane fuel
cells (PEMFC) have been extensively studied because
of its high efﬁciency compared to conventional fossil-
fuel power sources which are derived from burning
petroleum products which result in pollutants such as
CO2 and CO. However, CO removal in a hydrogen-
rich fuel is a critical issue when liquid hydrocarbon fu-
els are used as the hydrogen source for fuel cells. A
small amount of CO (∼10 ppm) in the reformed fuel
strongly adsorbs on the Pt active site and deteriorates the
fuel cell performance. Therefore, these small amounts

of CO must be removed to less than 10 ppm before
entering the fuel cell. Among the CO removal methods,
the preferential oxidation of CO seems to be the most
promising approach. However, in this reaction water is
formed via hydrogen oxidation, reverse water gas shift
and CO-methanization reactions. The side reactions are
as follows:

Hrxn, 298 K = −206.2 kJ/mol.
In recent years, much attention has been focused
on CeO2-supported noble metal catalysts due to their

1943
applications in automotive exhausts. CeO2 is added as
a promoter because of its unique redox properties, high
oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and stabilization of the
metal dispersion [1,2]. Summers and Ausen [3] claimed
that ceria donated oxygen to Pt for the oxidation of CO
on Pt/CeO2 catalyst. For Pd/CeO2, Cordatos et al. [4]
observed that lattice oxygen from the ceria can be trans-
ferred to the Pd surface by using the CO adsorption
measurement. The argument in favor of CeO2 has been
widely investigated as structural and electronic promot-
ers to improve the selectivity, activity, and thermal sta-
bility of the catalysts.
The
selective

oxidation
catalysts
such
as
alumina supported ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh) and
platinum (Pt) catalysts [5,6] have been extensively stud-
ied by a number of investigators and indicated that no-
ble catalysts are highly efﬁcient in removing CO [7,8]
and they follow a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism.
Thus, a promising catalyst must have sites that promote
CO adsorption for CO oxidation to take place and pro-
vide oxygen from the support. Recently, we reported on
the preparation of CeO2 using co-precipitation method
which is an active support for this reaction [9].
From our previous study among the CeO2 supported
noble metals, Pd/CeO2 catalyst showed poor activity
for this reaction. One way to increase the activity of the
Pd catalysts could be to include a Pt metal in the cata-
lyst. Many studies have been made on the approach of
combinatorial catalysis especially Pt and Pd for CO
oxidation reaction [10]. Using bimetallic system is
an attractive alternative that appears to enhance some
properties of the catalyst or some synergistic effect as
electronic effect/geometry effect. Although it is still
not yet well understood, it has been established that the
bimetallic system improves both activity and selectivity
of a great number of reactions [11,12]. Here we report
the synthesis of CeO2 supported Pt–Pd catalysts for
the selective CO oxidation in the large amount of hy-
drogen. Interestingly, unlike Pd/CeO2 the Pt–Pd have
been found to be ionically dispersed over CeO2 sup-
port and exhibited high activity at comparatively low
temperatures. The main objectives of the present work
are to investigate the catalytic activity of Pt–Pd/CeO2
for selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich stream and
its activity in the presence of CO2 and H2O.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The CeO2 support was prepared by sol–gel method.
An aqueous solution of CO(NH2)2 (Fluka) was added
into a Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Fluka). The mixture was heated
in an oven at 100 ◦C for 50 h and was then washed with
distilled water several times until there was no excess
anion. It was dried at 110 ◦C overnight and calcined
under air atmosphere at 300 ◦C for 2 h.
The Pt–Pd catalysts were prepared by co-impregnating
the appropriate amount of an aqueous solution of
H2PtCl6 ·6H2O (Fluka) and PdCl2 (Fluka) on to the ce-
ria support. The prepared catalysts were dried overnight
at 110 ◦C and calcined under air at 400 ◦C for 2 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Information about the composition and phase of
crystalline materials were obtained by the powder X-
ray diffraction (XRD). XRD patterns were obtained
by a Rigaku power diffractometer system equipped
with a RINT 200 wide angle goniometer using nickel-
ﬁltered CuK radiation (30 mA tube current, 40 kV tube
voltage).
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was
used to determine the surface area and pore size of
the prepared catalysts by N2 adsorption/desorption at
temperature of 77 K. Speciﬁc surface area was de-
termine using an Autosorb-1 Gas Sorption System
(Quantachrome Corporation).
A JEOL JEM 2010 equipped with the Oxford In-
struments Link Isis 300 X-ray microanalysis used to
obtain surface microstructures and surface composi-
tions. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images
crystallinity and crystal structures of the samples were
evaluated from the speciﬁc selected area of electron
diffraction patterns.
H2 pulse chemisorption was carried out by using
temperature program desorption reduction oxidation
(TPDRO/MS 1100). Prior H2 pulse chemisorption, the
catalyst was reduced in 5% H2/N2 at 600 ◦C for 1 h.
Then, the system was purged and cooled to 50 ◦C in
ﬂowing N2. H2 pulse chemisorption was performed at
50 ◦C using H2 99.99% purity and repeated at 5 min
intervals for 10 times.
2.3. Activity measurement
Catalytic activity studies were performed in a pyrex
glass U-tube reactor having an internal diameter of
6 mm under atmospheric pressure. One hundred mil-
ligram of catalyst was packed between glass wool plugs
in the center of the reactor. The reactant gas is com-
posed of 1% CO, 1% O2, 4% CO2, 40% H2 and helium
with the space velocity of 30, 000 ml g−1 h−1. The cat-
alysts were also tested for the CO oxidation both in the
presence of water, and CO2 using the following feed

mixtures: 1% CO, 1% O2, 4% CO2, 10% H2O, 40%
H2 and balanced in He and 1% CO, 1% O2, 25% CO2,
40% H2 and balanced in He, respectively. The reaction
temperature was varied from 50 to 190 ◦C.
An on-line gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent Tech-
nologies 6890N model) was used to analyze the re-
actant and product composition. The column utilized
in the chromatograph was a Carbosphere,
80
100 mesh,
10 ft × 1
8 in. stainless-steel packed column. The calcu-
lation of the CO conversion was based on the carbon
dioxide formation. The selectivity of CO oxidation was
deﬁned as the oxygen consumption for CO oxidation
divided by the total consumption of oxygen.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
BET surface areas of the commercial and syn-
thesized CeO2 are 117 and 137 m2/g, respectively.
Table 1 shows the BET surface area, average ceria
crystallite size and metal dispersion of the Pt–Pd/CeO2
catalysts with different Pt/Pd ratios. The sol–gel CeO2
supported catalyst gave the higher surface area and
smaller CeO2 crystallite size than that of commercial
CeO2 supported catalyst. The CeO2 crystallite sizes
of the prepared catalysts were determined from X-ray
line-broadening using the Debye Scherrer equation.
Fig. 1 shows the typical XRD patterns of the CeO2 in
the Pt–Pd/CeO2, the commercial CeO2 (Fig. 1a) and the
one prepared by the sol–gel synthesis (Fig. 1b). It was
clearly noticed that the XRD patterns of both supports
could be identiﬁed as nine main reﬂections which are
characteristic of the typical of a cubic structure of CeO2
corresponding to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2),
(4 0 0), (3 3 1), (4 2 0), (4 2 2) planes [13]. No evidence
of Pt or Pd metallic peaks is obtained, indicating small
particles of PtO or PdO with mean diameters less than
5 nm, below the X-ray detection range.
The TEM picture of 1% (1:7) Pt–Pd/CeO2 impreg-
nation on sol–gel shown in the Fig. 2(a) revealed the
presence of the metallic particle size as dark spots in
the catalyst. The existence of Pt–Pd particles on CeO2
support was veriﬁed by using EDS. The mean diameters
derived from histograms are shown in Fig. 2b and they
are uniformly distributed on the support. The average
particle size of metallic particle size is about 1.92 nm.
3.2. Catalytic activity
3.2.1. Effect of support
Two types of support were observed for the activ-
ity of 1% (1:1) Pt–Pd/CeO2 at temperature range of
50.190 ◦C. As shown in Fig. 3, CO conversion and
selectivity of sol–gel CeO2 supported catalysts were
higher than that of commercial CeO2 for all tempera-
ture range of interest. Increasing temperature from 50
to 130 ◦C increased the CO conversion from 10% to
41% for sol–gel CeO2 supported catalysts and from
5% to 12% for commercial CeO2 supported catalysts.
The temperature at maximum CO conversion of sol–gel
supported catalyst was 130 ◦C whereas the selectiv-
ity decreased with increasing temperature. The maxi-
mum selectivity of sol–gel support and of commercial
support was 65% and 51%, respectively, at 50 ◦C, the
lowest temperature. The CO conversion and selectivity
correspond very well with the results of Mariño and
co-worker [14] using a similar catalyst. In fact, as the
temperature increases the H2 oxidation appeared to be
greatly favored at high temperatures and its rate be-
comes faster than CO oxidation reaction. Moreover, H2
oxidation had higher activation energy than CO oxida-
tion [15].
In the case of ceria-based catalysts, as the reducible
ceria may also provide adsorbed oxygen species that can
spill over from the support to the metal particles, the re-
duced Ce3+ being subsequently reoxidized by gaseous
oxygen:
2Ce4+ + O2−+ ∗→2Ce3+ + O∗,
2Ce3+ + 1/2O2 →2Ce4+ + O2−.
Accordingly, the ceria supported catalyst could par-
ticipate in the CO oxidation reaction in the presence
of hydrogen by the reducible ceria as mentioned pre-
viously. However, synthesized CeO2 exhibited a sub-
stantial increase in activity. The results obtained in this
experiment suggest that this could be due to the differ-
ences in CeO2 crystallite size, surface area of the cat-
alyst and the support. The higher activity of 1% (1:1)
Pt–Pd/CeO2 (sol–gel) than % (1:1) Pt–Pd/CeO2 (com-
mercial) is also attributed to the higher metal dispersion
on the surface of catalyst. From the comparisons done
under this condition, the synthesized CeO2 was chosen
as the support for studying the effect of catalyst ratio.
3.2.2. Effect of catalyst ratio
Five different loaded catalysts were investigated for
the CO oxidation activity as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The
effect of Pd contents (Pt: Pd = 1: 1, 1: 3, 1: 5, 1: 7, 1: 9)
with about 1% wt. total metal loading on Pt–Pd/CeO2
catalysts was examined as a function of temperature in
the fuel stream (1% CO, 1% O2, 4% CO2, 40% H2 bal-
ance in helium). Fig. 4 representing the CO conversions
at various reaction temperatures show the need of Pd to

be loaded in higher amounts at this temperature range
since the activity of catalyst at a ratio of Pt: Pd = 1: 1
is still low, ∼40% CO conversion. The catalytic activ-
ity was obviously increased with the increasing content
of Pd. However, the results at a ratio of Pt: Pd = 1: 9
evidenced that it was not necessary to load Pd in very
high loadings. The catalyst with a ratio of Pt: Pd = 1: 7
showed the best performance, 76% CO conversion and
∼55% selectivity and at 90.110 ◦C. Moreover, the max-
imum CO conversion temperature shows much larger
shifts in peak position, as shifted down from 130 ◦C of
a ratio of Pt: Pd = 1: 1 to ∼90.110 ◦C. That would be
expected with a particle size effect. Therefore, Pd with
an atomic ratio of 7 is suggested to be optimum load-
ing for Pt–Pd/CeO2 catalyst and was chosen to be the
appropriate ratio for the further experiment.
In general, crystallite size is an important factor
that affects the activity and selectivity of catalysts.

that the crystallite of CeO2 and metallic sizes might

Pt and Pd were found to be homogeneous and well
dispersed on the support material, as there is evidence
of its presence in either EDS or TEM. Narui et al. [17]
attributed the superior combustion activity of PdPt to
higher dispersion of supported particles and suppression
of particle growth.

tion to twice the stoichiometric ratio of the oxygen

concentration (1% O2 ), the CO conversion increased to
76% at 90.110 ◦C. Ninty nine percent CO conversion
of 1% CO at 90 ◦C can be achieved by increasing the
oxygen concentration to 2%. As a result, the selectivity
towards CO oxidation decreases as the oxygen concen-
tration increases and were in the order of 44%, 55%
and 57% for 2, 1 and 0.5% O2 concentrations, respec-
tively, at the maximum CO conversion. This result is
in agreement with the results obtained by our group on
Au/CeO2 catalysts [9].
3.2.4. Effect of H2O concentration
The inﬂuence of water vapor has been studied
by adding 10% of water to the feed stream. Fig. 7
shows the changes in CO conversion and selectivity
of Pt–Pd/CeO2 as a function of temperature. An en-
hancement of CO oxidation reaction can be apparently
observed when adding 10% water vapor in the feed.
At 90 ◦C, when there was no water vapor in the feed
stream the CO conversion was about 76% and when
adding 10% water vapor in the feed stream the CO con-
version was increased to 85%. In addition, the activity
was increased over the whole temperature range from
50 to 190 ◦C. A number of explanations have been pro-
posed for the enhancement of activity in the presence
of water. One was that water enhances the water gas
shift reaction and as a result more CO was converted
into CO2, the second possibility was that the hydroxyl
group formed on the catalyst upon adsorption of water

was a better oxidation than oxygen and increases the
oxidation rate of CO and hydrogen [18]. In addition,
it has been reported that the bimetallic PdPt is less
sensitive to water in the process steam compared with
monometallic Pd catalysts [19].
3.2.5. Effect of CO2
It is crucial to know how this catalyst performs with
the certain amounts of CO2 in the feed because in re-
ality, the gas stream which is produced from reformer
and water gas shift reactors contain about 20–25% CO2.
Therefore, the effect of CO2 concentration (4% and
25%) on the activity of Pt–Pd/CeO2 catalyst is shown in
Fig. 8. The CO conversion substantially dropped from
76% to 50% at 90.110 ◦C when increasing CO2 con-
centration in the feed stream. The presence of CO2
also affected the selectivity in the temperature range of
50.190 ◦C. There are three possible explanations for the
effect of CO2. One was that the reverse water gas shift
reaction takes place and hence lowers the reaction rate
for the CO removal. The second was the formation of
carbonate species over CeO2 sites. There was a slight
possibility of the impregnation on sol–gel catalysts, the
interface between ceria and platinum–palladium crys-
tallites contain mobile oxygen which was blocked by
CO2 adsorbing on the same sites. The other plausible
explanation was that at low temperature dissociation of

CO2 on Pt–Pd yields a higher effective CO concentra-
tion on the catalyst surface and, thus, reduced the rate of
oxidation as the reverse water gas shift reaction [20,21].
3.2.6. Effect of the presence of both H2O and CO2
As already discussed, both 10% water and 25% CO2
were fed in the feed and observed the performance of
this catalyst as shown in Fig. 9. Although the presence
of water promoted a signiﬁcant increase in the CO ox-
idation activity and CO2 in the feed retarded the CO
oxidation reaction, the combination of water and CO2
increased both the CO conversion and selectivity from
76% to 83% and from 55% to 60%, respectively, at
about 90 ◦C. In addition, the positive effect of water
was more pronounced than the negative effect of CO2
in the feed over the temperature range. As compared
to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of water in the feed
enhances the CO oxidation rate [6,22].
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, this work was achieved for sol–gel ce-
ria by attempting a urea gelation synthesis. Among the
various Pt–Pd/CeO2 catalysts having different Pt/Pd ra-
tios, the 1% (1:7) Pt–Pd/CeO2 (sol–gel) had the highest
activity (∼76% CO conversion) at ∼90.110 ◦C under
the condition of 1% CO, 1% O2, 4% CO2, 40% H2 and
He as balance. The maximum CO conversion of ∼99%
was obtained at 90 ◦C when increasing O2 concentra-
tion to 2%. The addition of water vapor to the feed had
a well-noted positive effect. It reduced the activation
energy for both CO oxidation and hydrogen oxidation
and thus resulted in an increased conversion and se-
lectivity. The increased CO2 concentration in the feed
stream reduced the conversion and selectivity of CO.
Our stability results of Pt–Pd/CeO2 catalyst at the re-
action temperature of 90 ◦C during 24 h showed the
high stability of this catalyst. However, multi-stage re-
actor is needed to lower the CO concentration below
10–100 ppm for PEMFC systems.
