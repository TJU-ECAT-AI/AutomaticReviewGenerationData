Density functional theory is used to study oxygen adsorption and its effect on surface segregation in
(211) surfaces of Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys. It is found that the most energetically
favorable oxygen adsorption site is the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step. Surface segregation
phenomena is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only
one, among the studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior even in presence of oxygen
adsorbed.

1. Introduction
One of the most important challenges in low temperature fuel
cell technology is improving the catalytic efﬁciency, especially at
the electrode-catalyst where molecular oxygen, in a kinetically
slow reaction, is reduced and combines with protons yielding
water. The electrocatalysis process is carried out on nanoparticles
with the goal of employing the smallest amount of material that
is able of maximizing catalytic activity and stability. As an efﬁcient
catalyst, Pt has become the most widely used electrocatalyst for
the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, as a no-
ble metal, Pt is extremely expensive. Moreover, the relatively slug-
gish ORR kinetics on Pt surfaces considerably limits its catalytic
efﬁciency [1]. Therefore, it is indispensable to develop new cata-
lysts with lower cost and higher activities.
Near surface alloys (NSAs) are deﬁned as alloys wherein a solute
metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations
different from the bulk (e.g. Pt monolayers on base metals). The
understanding and development of NSAs is a promising area of re-
search in catalyst design [2–5]. For example, recent studies show
that NSAs of Pt enhance the catalytic properties of pure Pt for H2
activation kinetics, whereas at the same time they bind adsorbates
much weaker than pure Pt [2–4]. In addition, NSAs represent an
alternative conﬁguration where minimum amounts of Pt are re-
quired. The core-shell structure studied in this work can be visual-
ized as a representation of a NSA. On the other hand, we chose
Pt3M(211) (M = Cr, Ir) alloy systems because these compositions
have been found among the most successful [6].
Although most studies focus on the understanding of the inter-
actions of adsorbates with perfect crystal surfaces, much of the
physics and chemistry that takes place on real materials occurs
at defects [7]. Therefore, investigating the role of defects may im-
prove our knowledge of real systems. In our case of interest, Pt
nanoparticles in the range of 2–5nm have about 40% (111) facets,
a similar percent of edges and corners whereas the additional 20%
are (100) surfaces [8]. High Miller index surfaces, like (211) sur-
faces, provide useful means to create a range of local atomic envi-
ronments such as steps or terraces [7]. The studied (211) stepped
surface can be classiﬁed as a surface with (111) terraces separated
by monatomic (100) steps as shown in Fig. 1.
For alloys, it has been reported that catalytic activity depends
dramatically on how the atoms arrange in the ﬁrst 2–3 layers of
the catalyst surface [9–12] and it is inﬂuenced by the surface seg-
regation phenomenon. Therefore, it is important to characterize
the surface atomic distribution of catalytic alloys and to elucidate
the effect of segregation on surface structure. In this work, we
investigate the surface segregation phenomenon carried out in
stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by the adsorption
of oxygen. Also, we discuss the effect of steps and terraces on the
oxygen adsorption energy as well as their effect on surface segre-
gation in comparison with that on (111) surfaces.
2. Computational details
We apply density functional theory (DFT) which has been suc-
cessfully used to study the adsorption and reaction on catalytic

surfaces [4,7,9,13–24]. The DFT calculations were performed using
the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [25–29]. In VASP
the Kohn–Sham equations are solved by self-consistent algorithms.
In order to improve the calculation efﬁciency, core electrons were
replaced by the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudo–poten-
tials [30,31] and the valence electrons were described by plane
wave basis sets. In this work, the plane wave was expanded up
to a cutoff energy of 340 eV.

Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh. The exchange-correlation func-
tional was described within the generalized gradient approxima-
tion (GGA) proposed by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) [32].
Spin polarization was taken into account in the calculations and
the Methfessel–Paxon method was employed to determine elec-
tron occupancies with a smearing parameter r of 0.2 eV. The con-
vergence criteria for the electronic self-consistent iteration and the
ionic relaxation loop were set to 104 eV and 103 eV, respectively.
The Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys possess close-packed fcc structures
[33–35], in which the Pt atoms occupy the face-centered positions
and the M atoms are located at the corners in the unit cell, as
shown in Fig. 2. The (211) stepped surface was created cleaving
the fcc unit cell through the corresponding Miller plane.
Simulation supercells for the Pt3M alloy system and core-shell
structure are shown in Fig. 3, they consist of a 4-layer slab and a
6-layer vacuum space (12 Å). In the core-shell super cell the ﬁrst
layer is formed by Pt atoms only, whereas the core (the other three
layers) is constituted by either pure Co or Ir (denoted by M atoms
in Fig. 3c). The core was built as pure Co or Ir in fcc arrangements,
bulk calculations provided the lattice constants of 3.520 Å and
3.876 Å, respectively. These lattice constant values compare with
the experimental values of 3.56 Å [36] for fcc Co and 3.84 Å for Ir
[37]. Although Co is hcp in bulk, it has been reported that it adopts
fcc structure in nanoparticles of diameters below 20 nm [38]. In
both surface conﬁgurations, Pt3M and core-shell structure, the
atoms in the top three layers were allowed to relax to the lowest
energy conﬁguration, while the atoms of the bottom layer were
ﬁxed to their bulk positions.
The (211) surface has (111) terraces separated by monatomic
(100) steps as shown in Fig. 3, where site 1 corresponds to a step site
while sites 2 and 3 are terrace sites. The segregation structures in
the core-shell structure were obtained exchanging Pt atoms of the
ﬁrst layer and core atoms of the second layer through any of sites
1 to 3, whereas for the Pt3M system the segregation structures were
the result of exchanging M atoms from the ﬁrst layer and Pt atoms at
the second layer through sites 1 or 3 [23]. Segregation structures
were studied with and without the presence of oxygen adsorbed.
For the simulation of oxygen adsorption, as initial conﬁguration
we placed an oxygen atom in a bridge position involving any of the
atoms of sites 1 to 3 and its adjacent atom in the y-direction as
shown in Fig. 4. The oxygen atom was allowed to relax together
with the atoms in the top three layers to its lowest energy conﬁg-
uration. We chose a bridge site as initial conﬁguration based in our
calculations of oxygen adsorption on pure Pt(211) discussed in the
next section.
The surface segregation energy, Esegr, is generally deﬁned as the
energy of moving an atom from the interior to the surface of a crys-
tal. In this work, it is characterized as the difference of total energies
of the slab with the segregated structure and that with the non-seg-
regated structure [23]. For the core-shell structures having pure Pt
in their shell we test M segregation to the surface, thus a negative
value of segregation energy indicates that the M atoms are able to
segregate to the surface, while a positive segregation energy sug-
gest no M segregation on the surface. In the case of the Pt3M we test
the segregation of Pt, negative values of surface segregation energy
imply that Pt atoms segregate to surface, whereas positive segrega-
tion energies mean no Pt segregation to the surface. On the other
hand, the adsorption energy, Eads, was evaluated subtracting from
the total energy of the slab with oxygen adsorbed the total energy
of the slab without oxygen and the total energy of the oxygen atom.
In the present study, we will denote with (E0segr)i the segregation
energy calculated in the presence of oxygen bonded to surface
involving adsorption site i, as deﬁned in Fig. 3.
3. Results and discussion
We begin this section discussing the results of oxygen adsorp-
tion on pure Pt(211) surfaces; such results provide information
about the most stable sites for oxygen adsorption. Then, we ana-
lyze the adsorption of oxygen and its effect over surface segrega-
tion on Pt3M(211) and Pt/M (211) core-shell surfaces.
3.1. Oxygen adsorption on pure Pt(211)
First we identify the most stable adsorption sites on pure Pt
(211) surfaces. The adsorption energies corresponding to different
adsorption sites are shown in Fig. 5, sites (a) to (f) are different

types of bridge sites, whereas (g) and (h) depict hollow sites. The
most energetically favorable adsorption site with Eads = 4.55 eV
corresponds to the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step,
denoted with (a) in Fig. 5. We found that the adsorption sites lo-
cated on the (111) terraces are less energetically stable than step
sites. These results are in agreement with scanning tunneling
microscopy experiments that indicate that oxygen atoms resulting
from dissociation of the molecular precursor state locate on upper
sites of Pt step edges [39]. In addition, our results agree with re-
ports indicating that steps on Pt(111) bind oxygen molecules
and atoms more strongly than terrace sites [39–42] and with the
experimental observation of a minority of O atoms on the terraces
in the dissociation of O2 over Pt [39]. Based on these results we
decided to use bridge sites as initial conﬁgurations for the study
of oxygen adsorption in Pt3M systems and core-shell structures.
We have also tested the 4-fold binding site on the step of the
Pt(211) surface, and found that is unstable. After relaxation, the
oxygen atom adsorbs on the bridge site over the step.
3.2. Adsorption on Pt3Co(211) and Pt3Ir(211)
The most stable oxygen adsorption sites and their correspond-
ing adsorption energies for Pt3Co(211) and Pt3Ir(211) surfaces
are shown in Fig. 6. Our calculations show that O adsorption on a
PtM bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step is more favor-
able energetically than that on the PtPt terrace bridge site for both
surfaces, having an energy difference of 1.03 eV and 1.40 eV be-
tween both sites for Pt3Co and Pt3Ir, respectively. The obtained
adsorption energies in the step sites, 4.80 eV for Pt3Co and
5.23 eV for Pt3Ir, imply stronger oxygen binding than that in
the equivalent site of the Pt(211) surface in which the adsorption
energy is 4.55 eV (Fig. 5a). Moreover, the oxygen adsorption in
Pt3M(211) surfaces is stronger than in the Pt(111) surface, where
the experimental adsorption energy reported is 4.32 eV [43] and
DFT studies provide 3.86 eV for a bridge site and 4.48 eV for a
fcc site [44]. The oxygen binding energy of the bridge site over
the step in the Pt3Co(211) surface is 0.43 eV higher than the equiv-
alent site in the (111) surface [44]. We found that the oxygen
adsorption in the terrace site next to the (100) step, denoted as
adsorption site 3 in Fig. 3, is not stable. We also tested the top sites
on
Pt3Co,
yielding
the
following
results:
O
bound
to
Co,
Eads = 4.34 eV, O bound to Pt, Eads = 3.74 eV. Thus, both cases
show a weaker adsorption energy than the bridge site over the step
(Eads = 4.80 eV). On Pt3Ir: O bound to Ir, Eads = 4.77 eV, O bound
to Pt, Eads = 3.45 eV. Again, both cases show a weaker adsorption
energy than that on the bridge site over the step (Eads = 5.23 eV).
3.3. Surface segregation in Pt3Co(211) and Pt3Ir(211)

Pt3Ir(211) surfaces are shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. For
both systems in vacuum we ﬁnd that there is Pt segregation to
the surface, with a pure Pt top layer being the most stable conﬁg-
uration. The corresponding segregation energies are 0.87 eV for
Pt3Co and 1.20 eV for Pt3Ir. These energies are higher than those
reported by Ma and Balbuena [23] for Pt3Co(111) and Pt3Ir(111)
surfaces, whose segregation energies are 0.61 eV and 0.54 eV,
correspondingly. Experimental results from Menning et al. [45]
also suggested that (111) surfaces of Pt–Co–Pt structures are rela-
tively stable, with outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co
atoms coexisting.
When oxygen is present, the most stable conﬁguration is again
the adsorption on a bridge site over the step; in this case we ob-
serve for both alloys that Pt segregation takes place only through
Fig. 5. Adsorption sites investigated for Pt(211) surfaces. Sites (a) to (f) are different types of bridge sites; (g) and (h) are hollow sites. Note that in (d) the O is adsorbed in a
bridge site formed by one Pt atom (shown) and another from an image cell (not shown). In the top view, only the top layer is shown to improve the visualization, Pt atoms
represented in gray and O atoms in red. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

the terrace site and the Co or Ir atoms in the step remain in the sur-
face.
Our
calculations
provide
surface
segregation
energies,
(E0segr)1, of 0.61 eV and 0.47 eV for Pt3Co and Pt3Ir, respectively.
If oxygen adsorption takes place in a bridge site over a terrace
(adsorption site 2 in Fig. 4), we ﬁnd Pt segregation through step
and terrace sites, which is the same behavior observed on the clean
surfaces. The segregation energies obtained, (E0segr)2, are 0.84 eV
for Pt3Co and 1.44 eV for Pt3Ir. However such adsorption site
has weaker adsorption energies for both alloys (Fig. 6). We observe
for both systems that the oxygen adsorption over the step de-
creases the Pt segregation energy, being this effect more dramatic
for the Pt3Ir surface.
In Tables 1 and 2 we present the effect of oxygen adsorption on
the distance between the ﬁrst and second layers (d12) and the

surface segregation energies for the various sites of the Pt3Co and
Pt3Ir (211) surfaces. We observe that the oxygen adsorption in a
bridge site over the step (site 1 in Fig. 4) increases the distance be-
tween the ﬁrst and second layers for the non-segregated and seg-
regated structures of both systems (see (d012)1 column in Tables 1
and 2 compared to d12 column). In contrast, the effect of the oxy-
gen adsorption on the terrace site is to reduce the distance (see
(d012)2 column) between those two layers. On the other hand, the
oxygen adsorption over the step site increases the Pt segregation
energy when it occurs through site 3 (referred to Fig. 3) in the
Pt3Co surface. For the Pt3Ir system, the oxygen binding to the step
site (site 1) decreases the Pt segregation energy for all the segrega-
tion structures, even making energetically unfavorable the Pt seg-
regation through the step site. When the oxygen adsorption takes
place on the terrace site (site 2), the Pt segregation energies of the
Pt3Co surface decrease slightly, whereas for the Pt3Ir system the Pt
surface segregation is enhanced.
3.4. Adsorption on Pt/Ir and Pt/Co (211) core-shell structures
The most stable adsorption sites and their corresponding
adsorption energies for Pt/Co(211) and Pt/Ir(211) core-shell struc-
tures are shown in Fig. 9. For both systems the energetically most
stable adsorption site is the bridge site over and parallel to the
(100) step, with oxygen adsorption energies of 4.52 eV for Pt/
Co and 4.33 eV for Pt/Ir. These binding energies are slightly high-
er than the adsorption energy of 4.32 eV [43] found in the
Pt(111) surface, also following a similar trend to that reported
by Menning et al. [46] If the oxygen adsorption takes place over
a terrace (adsorption site 2 in Fig. 4), the binding energy in both
systems is smaller than the one observed in the Pt(111) surface;
however, the oxygen adsorption in the terrace is less energetically
favorable than the adsorption over the steps.
3.5. Surface segregation in Pt/Ir and Pt/Co (211) core-shell structures
In the core-shell structures we investigate segregation of the
core elements (Co and Ir) to the surface. The most stable segrega-
tion structures in vacuum and with oxygen adsorbed in Pt/
Co(211) core-shell conﬁguration are shown in Fig. 10. We ob-
serve Co segregation through a terrace (site 3 in Fig. 3c) in the
clean surface and when oxygen adsorption occurs in a terrace
site. However, the most energetically favorable segregation struc-
ture in presence of oxygen involves the adsorption over the step
site; in this case the Co segregation occurs through the step with
segregation energy of 0.27 eV. The Co segregation behavior
agrees with DFT calculations on (111) and (100) surfaces [46].
In contrast, for the Pt/Ir(211) surface our calculations show that

there is no Ir segregation to the top layer neither in vacuum nor
with oxygen adsorbed in any of the two stable adsorption sites.
The structures with the highest antisegregation energies are
shown in Fig. 11. The Ir antisegregation behavior observed in
the Pt/Ir(211) is comparable to the Ir antisegregation observed
in the (111) surface [47]; however, for the (211) surface even
in the presence of oxygen adsorbed, the Ir segregation is still
not favorable.

Tables 3 and 4 show the effect of oxygen adsorption on the dis-
tance between the ﬁrst and second layer and surface segregation
energies for the Pt/Co and Pt/Ir(211) core-shell surfaces, respec-
tively. The effect of the oxygen adsorption in a bridge site over
the step (site 1) is to increase slightly the distance between the ﬁrst
and second layer for the segregated structures of both alloys. When
the oxygen adsorption occurs on a terrace site, its effect on the dis-
tance between the ﬁrst and second layers is not uniform for all the
segregation structures.
On the other hand, the surface segregation is enhanced when
oxygen binds to the step and it takes place through the step site
for Pt/Co and Pt/Ir systems. However, this increment in the segre-
gation energy is not high enough to make the Ir segregation ener-
getically favorable in the Pt/Ir surface. The oxygen adsorption on
the terrace site increases the segregation energy for almost all seg-
regation structures. Nevertheless, the Ir segregation remains unfa-
vorable even in presence of oxygen adsorbed.
3.6. Summary of results
In Table 5 we summarize the calculated adsorption and segre-
gation energies for the studied systems. As we mentioned before,
the most stable conﬁgurations in all cases involve the oxygen
adsorption over the (100) step, corresponding to a stronger oxygen
binding compared with the less energetically favorable terrace
adsorption site. We observe that higher adsorption energies are re-
lated to smaller segregation energies. The Pt/Ir(core) system is the
only one that exhibits antisegregation behavior even under the
presence of oxygen, this implies that the Pt monolayer may remain
at the top of the surface. Moreover, the calculated adsorption en-
ergy for the Pt/Ir(core) (211) surface is only 0.1 eV higher than
such reported for the Pt(111) surface [43]. Therefore, the Pt/Ir(-
core) system is a good candidate for further research.
As a ﬁnal comment, is worth to mention that segregation at the
step might occur when oxygen is adsorbed. Even if step edge seg-
regation is not as exothermic as segregation through the terrace
when oxygen remains adsorbed at the step edge, it is possible that
desorption of oxygen from the step edge might make step edge
segregation more exothermic than terrace segregation.
4. Conclusions
Oxygen adsorption and its effect on surface segregation in
(211) surfaces of Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys is
studied using DFT. It is found that the most energetically favorable
oxygen adsorption site is the bridge site over and parallel to the
(100) step. The calculated adsorption energies are higher than
those reported for Pt(111) surfaces; however, the oxygen binding
energy in the Pt/Ir(core) system is only 0.1 eV higher. We observed
Pt surface segregation in Pt3Co and Pt3Ir taking place through ter-
race sites, and Co segregation through the step site in Pt/Co(core)
structures. The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only one, among the
studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior of Ir even
in presence of oxygen adsorbed. The antisegregation energy in step
sites is much higher than that found in (111) surfaces of Pt/Ir(core)
systems. This characteristic, in addition to the slightly higher oxy-
gen binding compared to the Pt(111) surface makes the Pt/Ir(core)
system a good candidate for further research.
