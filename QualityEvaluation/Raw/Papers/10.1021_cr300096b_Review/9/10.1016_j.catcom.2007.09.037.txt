Abstract
In this work, bimetallic Pt,In catalysts supported on alumina and silica were studied for the reduction of nitrate to N2 in water, using
H2 as reducing agent. Kinetic and characterization results suggest that the active sites are bimetallic particles with the surface enriched in
Indium, probably Pt2In3 and/or Pt3In7 species. Of all the catalysts studied in this work, Pt(1 wt.%)In(0.25 wt.%)/Al2O3 is the most active
one. At low time-on-stream it has a very high conversion rate, but it decreases with time due to the segregation of Pt and Indium oxide
phases under reacting conditions in the aqueous media. The remarkable high activity of this catalyst during the initial stage of the reac-
tion makes this system very interesting for further studies on the reaction mechanism including the possibility of regenerating the active
sites.

1. Introduction
Catalytic denitriﬁcation is an eﬃcient technology for
water puriﬁcation [1,2] and many solid catalysts have been
reported in the literature [3–5]. The possible mechanism for
the catalytic reduction is through the combination of active
sites in bimetallic catalysts [6] where the nitrate is ﬁrst
reduced to nitrite and then the nitrite is reduced to nitrogen
or ammonium depending on the selectivity of the catalyst
and the pH of the solution. The aim of this work is to relate
the catalytic activity of Pt,In catalysts to their physico-
chemical properties and analyze how they are aﬀected by
the aqueous reaction media.
We have chosen the In,Pt metallic couple because In pro-
moted catalysts have good activity for the nitrates conver-
sion and a potential high selectivity to N2, as reported by
other authors [1–6]. As a matter of fact, Pru
¨sse et al. [6] pre-
sented a second generation of nitrate-reducing catalysts
which included In as promoter, also describing new concepts
such as the use of formic acid as reductant instead of hydro-
gen. On the other hand, in a preliminary screening of diﬀer-
ent catalysts we found that Pt(1 wt.%),In(0.25 wt.%)/Al2O3
has a remarkable initial activity, which decays after some
minutes on stream. Therefore, it would also be interesting
to get some insight on the origin of this phenomenon.

(Ketjen CK300, surface area: 180 m2/g, pore volume:
0.5 cc/g) or 20–40 mesh SiO2 pellets (AESAR Large Pore,
surface area: 300 m2/g, pore volume: 1 cc/g) at room tem-
perature in order to obtain 1 wt% of Pt and 0.25, 0.5, 1.0
or 1.2 wt% of In. The solids were dried overnight at
120 C and calcined for 2 h, at 500 C .
2.2. Characterization
Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) experi-
ments were performed on fresh and used samples in a
MICROMERITICS Autochem II measuring the H2 con-
sumption with a TCD detector (mV signal) after the drying
of the gases in a water-trap using a heating rate of 10 C/
min in a ﬂow of 5% H2/Ar (50 mL/min).
Dynamic CO chemisorption measurements were carried
out by sending 250-ll pulses of 2.5% CO/N2 on 0.10 g sam-
ples of fresh and used catalysts, after reduction in H2 for
1 h at 450 C.
X-ray diﬀractometer proﬁles were acquired with a Shi-
madzu XC-D1 diﬀractometer using CuKa radiation and
monochromator with a scan velocity of 1/min.
The X-ray photoelectron analysis (XPS) was performed
with an Axis Ultra DLD (Kratos Tech.). The spectra were
excited by the monochromatized AlKa source (1486.6 eV)
run at 15 kV and 10 mA.
2.3. Reaction experiments
The catalysts were pretreated under a ﬂow of H2
(100 mL min1) at 450 C with a heating rate of 10 C
min1. Then, a stirred batch reactor was loaded with
80.0 mL of distilled water, 200 mg of catalyst, and 100 N-
ppm of nitrate as initial concentration. Subsequently, a
hydrogen ﬂow of 400 ml min1 was fed to the batch reac-
tor. A pH of ca. 5 was maintained during the reaction time
by the addition of small amounts of HCl [7].
Small samples were taken from the vessel for the deter-
mination of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium using Vis spec-
troscopy (Cole Parmer 1100 Spectrophotometer) combined
with colorimetric reagents. In order to determine nitrates,
the Cd Column method and then the colorimetric reaction
were used. This colorimetric reaction is the same employed
in the assay for nitrites. Ammonium was analyzed by the
adapted Berthelot method.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1(A) shows that the Pt(1%)/Al2O3 catalyst has low
activity, and that the nitrate conversion strongly increases
after the addition of 0.25wt% In. The In(0.25%)Pt(1%)/
Al2O3 catalyst shows a very high initial conversion rate
but after ca. 15 min, it decreases reaching 67.7% of conver-
sion at 100 min. For the other catalysts with In loading
steeply increased up to a 1.0:1.2 wt. Pt:In ratio, the nitrate
conversion decreases with the In loading increase (see
Fig. 1(A) and Table 1).
Beside nitrogen, undesirable products such as nitrites
and ammonia are produced. Moreover, even though N2
is the main gaseous compound formed, nitrogen oxides
can also be produced [8]. Daum and Vorlop [9] suggested
that nitrogen oxides are reaction intermediates.
Fig. 2(A) shows that as the reaction progresses, a small
increase in nitrites concentration takes place, reaching
2.5 ppm as the maximum value for the catalyst with the
highest In content. The other catalysts show lower nitrite
production. The most active catalyst for nitrate reduction
[Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/Al2O3] shows the lowest nitrite formation
(0.5 ppm). Results for ammonia production are depicted in
Fig. 3(A). In general, higher Pt:In ratios produce higher
ammonia concentrations, reaching about 22–23 ppm.
We calculated the initial reaction rates at nitrate conver-
sions lower than 10%. At low conversions, product concen-
trations are small; thus, the initial rate is an intrinsic
property of the active sites towards the nitrate hydrogena-
tion reaction. These results are also shown in Table 1 con-
ﬁrming that the catalyst with the lowest amount of In
presents the highest activity and that it steeply decreases
when the In content increases. Since the non-promoted
Pt(1%)/Al2O3 catalyst presents little activity, an optimum
Pt:In ratio at about 1%,0.25% is observed. Probably,
higher loadings of In hinder the access of H2 molecules
to the Pt crystals.
A series of Pt,In supported on SiO2 was also prepared in
order to gain insight into the eﬀect of the support. Fig. 1(B)
shows that the nitrate conversion rates are considerably
lower than for Pt,In/Al2O3. This fact could be due to the
lower PZC value of silica, thus decreasing the rate of adsorp-
tion of nitrate ions. The PZC of silica is 3.2, whereas that of
alumina is 7.7, and these values do not change signiﬁcantly
with the incorporation of small amounts of Pt and In [10].
Fig. 2(B) shows that for Pt,In/SiO2, nitrite production
occurs to a similar extent if compared with Al2O3 sup-

ported solids. However, the ammonia concentrations are
an order of magnitude lower (see Fig. 3(B)). For example,
for the most active Pt,In/Al2O3 catalyst, the ammonia con-
centration is ca. 20 ppm at 100 min, while at the same time
it is only ca. 1 ppm for SiO2 supported catalysts.
The activity of Pt,In catalysts can be explained with a
redox mechanism similar to that proposed for Cu pro-
moted Pd catalysts supported on Al2O3 [11]. Due to the
H2 dissociation capacity of the Pd and Pt, they could work
as electron donors to reduce Cu or In, respectively, which
are then oxidized during the nitrate reduction.
4. Catalyst characterization
The alumina supported catalysts were characterized by
XRD and TPR both before and after reaction. Fig. 4
shows the XRD patterns of Pt,In/Al2O3 (Pt,In equal to
1%,1.2% and 1%,0.5%) and it can be seen that the fresh cat-
alyst only presents the Al2O3 characteristic peaks. How-
ever, the used catalyst shows a small peak at 2H = 43,
which is characteristic of indium oxide. On the right-hand
corner of Fig. 4, the 2H = 40 to 2H = 50 zone is magniﬁed
to better appreciate the peak.
TPR and XRD results are in agreement. Fig. 5 shows
the TPR of 1.2% and 0.5% In promoted Pt(1%) catalysts,
and also the monometallic catalysts for comparison. While
Pt/Al2O3 displays the main reduction peak at around
100 C, In/Al2O3 reduces with a broad peak centered at
400 C. This behavior is in agreement with the one reported
by Passos et al for bimetallic catalyst supported on Al2O3
[12]. In the presence of Pt, the reduction of In shifts to
lower temperatures, because the dissociative adsorption
of H2 on Pt promotes In reduction. In the case of fresh
Pt(1%),In(1.2%)/Al2O3, a well-resolved peak at low tem-
perature (around 120 C) with a shoulder at 200 C is
shown, due to the reduction of Pt and In species, respec-
tively. Table 2 shows the contribution of the diﬀerent
TPR peaks related to the diﬀerent species. We can see that
all the used samples have bigger contributions in the sec-
ond peak than in the fresh samples and that the ﬁrst peaks
reduce their contribution in the used samples, what clearly
indicate a change in the level of metal interaction, with seg-
regation of In in the used catalyst.
Similar results are obtained for the fresh catalyst with
Pt(1%),In(0.5%)/Al2O3. These results indicate that, in the

fresh catalyst Pt and In interact on the Al2O3 surface. The
same samples but after reaction show that Pt is reduced at
low temperature, but a new broad peak at ca. (450–500) C
appears. This high temperature peak corresponds to In2O3
which does not interact with Pt, the same observation made
above from XRD patterns. When Pt and In are segregated,
the hydrogen dissociative adsorption on the Pt crystalls fol-
lowed by spillover could also promote In species reduction
[13] thus decreasing the reduction temperature. Neverthe-
less, this eﬀect is much smaller than when the metals are
in intimate contact.
The chemical state of the elements and their relative pro-
portions have been determined by photoelectron spectros-
copy (Table 3). The In 3d5/2 BE of sample Pt:In/Al is
around 445.5 eV, similar to that reported for indium in
In2O3 [14]. The somewhat higher BE found in the silica
supported solid could be caused by a stronger interaction
between indium oxide and the support. Increases in BE
were previously observed in the In/ZSM-5 system caused
by the interaction between zeolite and In2O3 structures
[15]. Two components were observed for Pt 4d5/2, one at
lower BE (314.6–314.8 eV) associated with metallic plati-
num and another at higher BE (316.7–316.9 eV) signifying
the presence of oxidised platinum species, probably as PtO2
[16]. For silica calculations we used the more intense 4f sig-
nal, which could not be used for alumina due to its overlap-
ping Al2p.

Table 3 shows that the superﬁcial Pt/In ratio in both SiO2
and Al2O3 supported catalysts is lower than in the bulk,
both in fresh and used solids. This observation could be
explained with the ﬁndings of Alerasool et al. [17] who
investigated the surface enrichment of one metal in prefer-
ence to another in supported bimetallic clusters. They found
that it depended on the nature of the supporting material
and the mobility of the metallic precursors. For the used cat-
alyst the surface Pt/In ratio does not change, but the In/Al
and Pt/Al ratios strongly decrease, indicating that either
bimetallic or monometallic particles increase their size.
A diﬀerent type of particles could be present in the Pt–In
catalysts: Pt crystals, In oxides, and some type of Pt–In
compound. TPR results show that a close interaction exists
in the fresh catalyst, which is partially lost after reaction.
Thus, XPS results could be interpreted in terms of the exis-
tence of bimetallic particles enriched in In in their surface,
which after reaction segregate in bigger Pt and Indium
oxide crystals.
It is known that bimetallic particles may have diﬀerent
compositions if they form intermetallic compounds: Pt2In3,
Pt3In7 and a third one that only exists at very high temper-
atures [18]. These two compounds having atomic Pt/In
ratios lower than one may contribute to the In surface
enrichment. Since pure Pt particles display very low activ-
ity, and In alone cannot reduce itself, it can be expected
that bimetallic Pt,In particles be responsible for the activity
for nitrates reduction [19]. Experiments are planned using
EXAFS analyses, which is the appropriate tool to conﬁrm
the existence of bimetallic particles and estimate their com-
position. Anyway, in the light of the XRD, TPR and XPS
results, it can be inferred that the decrease in conversion
rate observed for the Pt,In/Al2O3 with Pt:In equal to 1%,
0.25% is originated in the segregation of Pt and In phases
during the time-on-stream.
The results also show that the catalysts with the highest
Pt:In ratio have the best activity. A higher In loading
results in catalysts with lower activity, probably because
Pt atoms are covered with In thus avoiding the H2 dissoci-
ation. This speculation is further supported by the In sur-
face enrichment observed in XPS results.
To further support the ﬁndings discussed above, dynamic
CO chemisorption measurements were carried out in fresh
and used Pt(1%),In(0.25%)/Al2O3 catalyst. The fresh cata-
lyst adsorbs a very low amount of CO showing an apparent
dispersion of only 1%. However, after reaction, the catalyst
is able to adsorb more CO (16% of dispersion). The appar-
ently low dispersion of the fresh catalyst could be ascribed
to some kind of electronic interaction among Pt and In in
the intermetallic particles [20] and the increase of dispersion
after use could be due to the previously discussed segrega-
tion, in line with the XRD, TPR and XPS results.
For comparison purposes, Table 1 also summarizes the
activities and selectivities of the Pt/In catalysts and those
obtained for Pd/Cu, Pd/In and Pd/Co catalysts, which were
studied in a previous work [21]. It was veriﬁed that out of the
three metal-promoted catalysts, the one promoted by Cu
presented both the highest activity to convert nitrates and
the highest selectivity to N2 because it presented the highest
conversion (85.4%) after 100 min. However, it should be
pointed
out
that
the
Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/Al2O3
catalyst
shows less conversion at 100 min but reaches a 50% nitrate
conversion in less time than the Pd/Cu catalyst. This indi-
cates that the Pt catalyst presents higher initial activity than

the Pd catalyst but it loses activity at higher times, a fact that
can be related to the particle segregation observed in used
catalysts.
5. Conclusions
Kinetic experiments using Pt,In supported catalysts
together with XPS and TPR results suggest that the active
sites consist of bimetallic particles with the surface enriched
in Indium, probably Pt2In3 and/or Pt3In7. However, EXAFS
experiments are being planned to further conﬁrm this point.
Among the catalysts studied in this work, Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/
Al2O3 is the most active one. At low time-on-stream, it has a
very high conversion rate, even higher than that observed for
the Pd,Cu catalyst. However, the conversion rate decreases
with time due to the segregation of Pt and Indium oxide
phases, as shown in TPR and XRD characterization. Cata-
lysts supported on silica have considerably lower activities,
probably due to the lower PZC of the support, which would
decrease the nitrate ions adsorption rate. Studies are under-
way to further clarify the nature of the active sites, the reac-
tion mechanism and the possibility of regenerating the highly
active Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/Al2O3 catalyst.
