Abstract
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) on the Pt and Au L3 edges showed that the structure of platinum and gold nanoclusters differs from that of the bulk metals. The interatomic distances are contracted and the s, p, and d orbitals rehybridize, which results in less filled 5d valence bands. The XAS spectra of the monometallic clusters were used to interpret the effect of alloying platinum and gold. Preparation of SiO2- and TiO2-supported PtAu catalysts from a Pt2Au4(C⋮CBut)8 precursor resulted in well-mixed bimetallic clusters. Gold was preferentially located on the surface of the small clusters. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) showed that the electronic structure of platinum and gold differed from that in the monometallic clusters. The Fermi levels of platinum and gold shifted in opposite directions:  the position of the Pt L3 edge shifted to higher energy and the Au L3 edge shifted to lower energy. Furthermore, the white-line intensity increased for gold and decreased for platinum. These changes originate from interatomic charge transfer from the Au 5d to the Pt 5d band, accompanied by intra-atomic charge redistributions. Charge transfer affected the energy positions of the 5d valence bands. Analysis of the XANES spectra, aided by full multiple-scattering calculations, revealed that the changes in the electronic structures are due to alloying and distance effects.

1. Introduction
Heterogeneous binary alloy catalysts often have different catalytic performances than either of the metal components. PtSn/SiO2, for example, selectively produces lactic acid from CO2 and ethylene in the presence of water, while Pt/SiO2 does not. 1 Bimetallic supported platinum−palladium catalysts are more active in the hydrogenation of aromatics in the presence of sulfur 2,3 and in the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene 4 than the combination of their monometallic constituents. Gold alloyed into the surface layer of a nickel catalyst improves the catalytic performance in steam reforming. 5 Addition of gold to bulk platinum leads to a decrease in the activity for hydrocarbon isomerization and hydrogenolysis with increasing gold content, whereas the dehydrogenation activity increases. 6-11 The same was found for PtAu sols on carbon.11 Other authors reported an increase in the skeletal isomerization selectivity in the methylcyclopentane conversion at the expense of hydrogenolysis. 12 In the methylcyclohexane conversion, the addition of gold to platinum enhanced the overall activity and the selectivity toward toluene. 13 Chandler et al. were the first to prepare bimetallic supported PtAu nanoclusters from a precursor containing both platinum and gold, namely, Pt2Au4(C⋮CBut)8. 14 They observed enhanced cracking activity and a decrease in the rate of skeletal isomerization reactions in the conversion of hexane. The platinum−gold clusters were more resistant to deactivation than pure platinum clusters. In most studies on supported platinum−gold catalysts, gold is considered an inactive additive and the explanations of the (catalytic) behavior are focused on platinum. However, gold nanoclusters on porous supports are catalytically active. 15,16 Thus, gold also requires attention. Moreover, many authors attribute the influence of gold on the catalytic performance of platinum solely to a geometric, or ensemble-size, effect. 17-19 Since it has been proposed that the strength of the adsorbate bonding and thus the catalytic activity depends on the position of the d band with respect to the Fermi level, 20,21 electronic and ligand effects cannot be ruled out.
In-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) can be used to study the structure of materials under various conditions. The first intense feature in the L edges is called the white line and is part of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), which gives information on the electronic structure. The white line in the XANES spectra of the Pt and Au L2 and L3 edges probes the shape and electron density of the 5d valence band. Charge redistribution occurs when alloying metals. 22 Electrons are transferred from the metal with the more occupied valence band to the metal with the less filled band, in this way stabilizing the bimetallic bond. Intra-atomic charge redistribution between the s, p, and d levels also occurs. Because of the charge redistribution, the position of the valence bands with respect to the Fermi level shifts and the bands broaden or narrow.22 XANES spectroscopy is useful to study the charge redistribution in supported bimetallic clusters. 23-25 Probing the L edges directly detects the number of holes in the d band. 26-30 The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) part of the XAS spectrum provides information on the geometric structures such as coordination numbers and interatomic distances.
We studied PtAu clusters with a size between 1 and 3 nm supported on SiO2 and TiO2 with electron microscopy and XAS and compared the physical properties to those of monometallic platinum and gold clusters of similar size on the same supports. To obtain a better understanding of the XANES spectra, the L3 near-edge structures and electron configurations of platinum and gold atoms in mono- and bimetallic clusters were simulated using the FEFF8 code, which reproduces the L3 XAS spectra of small metal clusters well. 31 The aim of this work is to establish the geometric and electronic structures of the supported platinum−gold clusters.
2. Experimental Methods
PtAu/SiO2 and PtAu/TiO2 were prepared by wet impregnation using Pt2Au4(C⋮CBut)8 as the metal precursor. This organometallic complex was synthesized using a multistep procedure 32 starting with tetrahydrothiophen (Merck, 821095.0005), HAuCl4 (abcr, S79−0500, 99.9%, 49% Au), 3,3-dimethyl-1-butyne (Aldrich, 244392), and PtCl2 (Johnson Matthey Chemicals Ltd.). The 0.60 g of Pt2Au4(C⋮CBut)8 in 100 mL hexane was added to a slurry of 13 g SiO2 (Merck 60, pore volume 0.74 mL/g, specific surface area 460 m2/g) in 40 mL hexane. The PtAu complex adsorbed directly on the SiO2, which was subsequently dried under vacuum at 298 K. The metal loading was 2 wt % Au and 1 wt % Pt. For PtAu/TiO2, 0.31 g Pt2Au4(C⋮CBut)8 in 135 mL hexane was added to 6.7 g TiO2 (Degussa P25, 0.22 mL/g, 50 m2/g). The entire amount of metal complex was not adsorbed on the TiO2. The metal loading was 1.4 wt % Au and 0.7 wt % Pt. Metallic PtAu clusters were obtained after calcination in air at 573 K and reduction in H2 at 473 K. Prior to use in the XAS experiments, the PtAu catalysts were reduced again in situ at 473 K. The 1 wt % Pt/SiO2 was prepared by adding an aqueous solution of tetraammine platinum nitrate (PTA) to a slurry of SiO2 (Davison 644, pore volume 1 mL/g, specific surface area 290 m2/g) in an NH4OH solution with a pH of 10. After adsorption of the PTA, the powder was filtered, was washed, was dried at 373 K, and was prereduced at 423 K. The 1.4 wt % Pt/TiO2 was prepared by adding TiO2 to an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (Fluka, 81080, 38% Pt) with pH 4.5 and by stirring the slurry for 2 h at 343 K. The resulting paste was filtered and washed with warm water, was dried under vacuum at 298 K, and subsequently was prereduced at 473 K. The supported platinum catalysts were reduced in situ at 473 K prior to use. The 3 wt % Au/SiO2 was prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation of SiO2 (Aerosil 300, 300 m2/g) with an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (pH = 1). After impregnation, the sample was washed using aqueous ammonia (pH = 11) and deionized water and was dried under vacuum at 298 K for 2 h. Prior to use, Au/SiO2 was reduced in situ at 473 K. The 2 wt % Au/TiO2 was prepared by deposition−precipitation. 33 TiO2 (P25, Degussa) was added to an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 with a pH of 7. The slurry was stirred for 1 h at 343 K. The resulting paste was filtered, was washed with warm water, and was dried under vacuum at 298 K. Prior to use, Au/TiO2 was reduced in situ at 373 K. Elemental analysis reported a chlorine content in the gold catalysts below the detection limit (<0.2 wt %).
The metal cluster sizes were determined using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) after reduction. The STEM investigations were performed with a Tecnai F30 microscope operating with a field emission cathode at 300 kV. The catalysts were dispersed in ethanol and were deposited onto a perforated carbon foil supported on a copper grid.
The XAS measurements were carried out at beam line X1 of Hasylab (Hamburg, Germany), the Swiss-Norwegian Beamline (SNBL) BM01B, and the Dutch-Belgian Beamline (DUBBLE) BM26A, the latter two at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). At beam line X1, the double-crystal monochromator was equipped with Si(111) crystals that were detuned to 70% of the intensity to remove higher harmonics. At the SNBL, the incident X-rays were monochromated by a Si(111) channel-cut monochromator, and a chromium-coated mirror rejected higher harmonics. At the DUBBLE station, a double-crystal monochromator was used, followed by two vertically focusing Pt- and Si-coated mirrors to reject the higher harmonics. All measurements were done in transmission mode using ionization chambers for detection. A spectrum of a platinum and/or gold foil was acquired simultaneously with each measurement for energy calibration. The catalysts were reduced in hydrogen. Subsequently, hydrogen was removed by evacuation at elevated temperature and XAS spectra were collected under vacuum at 300 K. XAS data analysis was carried out using the commercially available XDAP software package. 34 The absorption data were background-subtracted by means of standard procedures. 35 The spectra were normalized on the height of the edge step at 50 eV above the edge. Multiple-shell fitting was performed in R space (1.5 < R < 3.5 Å, 3 < k < 12 Å-1) using a k weighting of 3. Higher-order cumulants were included in the fit procedure. 36 Experimentally calibrated theoretical references of gold and platinum foils, Au2O3, and PtO2 obtained with the FEFF8 code were used.
Self-consistent field full multiple-scattering calculations were performed using the FEFF8 software code. 37 The L3 near-edge structures of the center atom in 55-atom clusters and of a surface atom in 6-atom clusters, containing platinum, gold, or both, were calculated. The valence-band occupations and the density of states (DOS) were calculated as well. A Hedin−Lundqvist potential and the L3 XANES, LDOS (angular momentum projected density of states), NOHOLE (complete core−hole screening), SCF (self-consistent field), and FMS (full multiple scattering) cards were used. The energy scale is the relative energy E − Ef as calculated by FEFF8 and was shifted 7 eV to higher energy to enable comparison with the experimental spectra. The 55-atom cluster had an fcc structure with bulk interatomic distances. The center atom in the 55-atom cluster can be considered as an atom in bulk metal, since four shells of neighboring atoms surround it. The six-atom cluster had two atoms in a first layer and four in a second 38 and consisted only of surface atoms. The center atom in the 55-atom cluster and the 6-atom cluster were chosen, since the local environment of the atoms in the supported clusters in this study was between these two extremes. The distances in the 6-atom cluster were shorter than in the 55-atom cluster; the distances in the samples were closer to those in the larger clusters. Since there could also be a distance effect on the experimental XANES, the interatomic distances in the alloy clusters were varied. We have calculated the electronic structures for platinum and gold in the following extreme cases:  atom surrounded only by Pt versus atom surrounded only by Au, atom in the bulk with bulk interatomic distances versus surface atom with contracted interatomic distances, and (only for the alloy clusters) long interatomic distances as in Au−Au versus short interatomic distances as in Pt−Pt. The geometric structures in the experimental situations are between these extremes.
3. Results
3.1. EXAFS. The energy of the Pt L3 edge is 11564 eV and that of the Au L3 edge is 11919 eV. Because of this small energy difference, the Pt L3 EXAFS of the platinum−gold catalysts could only be isolated till k = 9 Å-1. Figure 1 shows the k3-weighted Chi function and corresponding Fourier transform (FT) of the Pt and Au L3 edges of PtAu/SiO2 under vacuum. The data quality of the Au L3 EXAFS was good up to 15 Å-1. The amplitude of the oscillations and thus the intensity of the FT of the Pt L3 EXAFS were higher than that of the Au L3 EXAFS, suggesting that the platinum atoms had on average more neighbors. The period of the oscillations was longer in the Pt L3 EXAFS, and thus the platinum-neighbor distance was shorter than the gold-neighbor distance, as is clear in the FT.
Figure 1 (a) k3-weighted Chi functions and (b) corresponding Fourier transforms (k3 weighted, 3 < k < 9 Å-1) of Pt L3 (solid line) and Au L3 (dashed line) of PtAu/SiO2 under vacuum at 300 K.
Table 1 compares the structural parameters of the PtAu catalysts to those of the monometallic clusters and foils. The Pt−Pt coordination number (NPt-Pt) of Pt/SiO2 was 7.8 and that of Pt/TiO2 was 9.2. On TiO2, NPt-Pt and thus the clusters were larger, and so the Debye−Waller factor (Δσ2) was lower.The Pt−Pt bond distance in Pt/SiO2 was 2.70 Å, compared to a bulk distance of 2.76 Å. This contraction of the distance for metal clusters with low coordination numbers is caused by the increased electron density between the atoms because of rehybridization of the s, p, and d metal orbitals. 39 The contraction increases with decreasing cluster size. On TiO2, the platinum clusters were larger, and thus the contraction was less. Gold atoms are larger than platinum atoms, and thus the interatomic distance in the gold clusters was larger than in the platinum clusters. The Au−Au interatomic distance contracted by 0.01−0.04 Å, depending on the cluster size, with respect to the bulk value of 2.85 Å. 40 The gold clusters had similar coordination numbers and Debye−Waller factors as the platinum clusters on the same support. The backscattering amplitudes and phase shifts of platinum and gold are similar, since they are next to each other in the periodic table. Thus, no distinction could be made between Pt and Au backscatterers. Therefore, the EXAFS of the Pt L3 edge of the bimetallic catalysts was fitted with a Pt−Pt reference and that of the Au L3 edge with a Au−Au reference. In PtAu/SiO2, platinum had nine neighbors at 2.78 Å, which is longer than the bulk Pt−Pt distance of 2.76 Å and much longer than the Pt−Pt distance in platinum clusters with a similar NPt-M. Gold had eight neighbors at 2.79 Å, which is 0.02 Å less than in gold clusters supported on SiO2 with the same N. On TiO2, platinum had eight neighbors at 2.75 Å and gold had eight neighbors at 2.82 Å, which is similar to the interatomic distances in the monometallic clusters on the same support.

3.2. Cluster Size from EXAFS and STEM. Table 2 lists the metal cluster sizes and corresponding metal dispersions of all catalysts, as determined with EXAFS and STEM. The cluster size from EXAFS was derived from the metal−metal coordination number, assuming spherical clusters. 41 On SiO2, the platinum clusters were almost 2 nm in diameter, the gold clusters were about 1.3 nm, and the PtAu clusters were 1.6 nm. On TiO2, the clusters had a larger diameter of around 2 nm. On the same support, the platinum, gold, and PtAu clusters had similar sizes, making a comparison possible. The cluster-size distributions of PtAu/SiO2 and PtAu/TiO2 were uniform though broad for the larger clusters on TiO2, as determined with STEM. There is a discrepancy between the PtAu cluster sizes determined from STEM and from EXAFS most likely because the size determination from EXAFS is not straightforward for bimetallic clusters. The cluster sizes were derived from a coordination number that was the average of the N around Pt (1×) and that around Au (2×). Moreover, the short k range of the Pt EXAFS affects the accuracy of the coordination number, because it correlates with the Debye−Waller factor.

3.3. Experimental XANES. Figure 2 shows the L3 and L2 edges of bulk platinum and gold. The L3 edge is the transition corresponding to the 2p3/2 core level. It contains mainly 2p3/25d5/2 character and some 2p3/25d3/2 character. Because platinum is a d9 metal, the d band is not completely filled and the 5d5/2 band of platinum lies partly above the Fermi level. 42 The first intense feature in the Pt L3 edge is called the white line and reflects the number of holes in the 5d band (Figure 2a).26-30 The L2 edge is the transition corresponding to the 2p1/2 core level and contains mainly 2p1/25d3/2 but also 2p1/25d5/2 character. This last transition is allowed, since the 5d5/2 and 5d3/2 valence bands are not well separated because of the hybridization of the 5d band states with the overlapping 6s and 6p bands. Because of the 2p1/25d5/2 transition, the Pt L2 edge also exhibits a small white line. Gold is a d10 metal, but because of the s−p−d hybridization in the bulk metal, the d band is not completely filled and the electron configuration of bulk gold is 5d10-x6sp1+x.28,43,44 Therefore, the L3 edge of bulk gold also has intensity in the white-line region (Figure 2b).23,29

Figure 3 compares the Pt and Au L3 edges of PtAu/SiO2 with those of Pt/SiO2 and Au/SiO2, respectively. The edges of the catalysts had less intense features than those of the foils, since the coordination number in the clusters was lower. The Pt L3 edge of platinum in the bimetallic clusters was shifted slightly to higher energy with respect to the L3 of the pure platinum clusters, and its white line was broader and lower. The EXAFS wiggles do not overlap, since there is a difference in R between the bi- and monometallic clusters. The Au L3 edge of PtAu/SiO2 was shifted to lower energy and had a higher intensity around the edge compared to that of Au/SiO2. Around 15 eV, the intensity also increased. Figure 4 shows the general features in the Pt and Au L3 spectra of the TiO2-supported catalysts. The Pt L3 white line was lower and broader and the edge was shifted to higher energy for the PtAu clusters compared to the platinum clusters. The intensity of the second feature at 15 eV had decreased. The Au L3 edge of Au/TiO2 and PtAu/TiO2 differed:  for PtAu it was shifted to lower energy and the intensity of the second feature had increased. From 20 eV above the edge, the Pt L3 edge of PtAu/TiO2 overlapped with that of Pt/TiO2 because the structural parameters around either platinum were the same for these catalysts. The same holds for the Au L3 edge of PtAu/TiO2 and Au/TiO2.

Table 3 summarizes the observed changes in the edges upon alloying. The Pt and Au L3 edges shifted in opposite directions upon alloying. The white-line intensity increased for platinum, whereas the intensity of the second feature (between 5 and 20 eV) decreased for platinum and increased for gold. These energy shifts and intensity changes suggest changes in the electronic structures. The effects of alloying, cluster size, and interatomic distance were investigated with calculations of the XANES.

3.4. Calculations. Figure 5a shows the Pt L3 XANES of a platinum atom surrounded either by four shells of platinum or four shells of gold, as calculated using the FEFF8 code. This calculated L3 of bulk platinum had an intense white line, as in the experimental spectrum of the platinum foil (cf. Figures 5a and 2a), and all other experimental features were well reproduced. The white line of the L3 of the platinum atom in the bulk decreased strongly when all its neighbors were gold atoms. The edge shifted ca. 2 eV to higher energy. The intensity decreased slightly more and the edge shifted a bit further with the shorter interatomic distances. The distance effect was most apparent in the second feature around 15 eV:  when the distances stay the same, upon alloying the intensity of this feature increased, and when the distances increased, the intensity decreased and the feature shifted to lower energy. Furthermore, the distance effect was clear in the period of the EXAFS wiggles (≳30 eV). The calculated L3 edge spectra of the six-atom clusters had less intense features than that of the atom in the bulk, and the white line of the Pt6 cluster was less intense than that of bulk platinum (Figure 5b). The white line of the L3 of the platinum atom in the six-atom cluster decreased in intensity upon alloying. The edge shifted ca. 1 eV to higher energy. When maintaining the platinum−metal distances, the white line also broadened upon alloying. Since the platinum atom had only five gold neighbors, the effect of alloying on the Pt L3 XANES was less strong than for the Pt atom in the 55-atom cluster.
Figure 5 Calculated Pt L3 XANES of (a) platinum center atom in a Pt55 cluster with R = 2.807 Å (dashed line) and in a PtAu54 cluster with R = 2.807 Å (solid line) and with R = 2.885 Å (dashed−dotted line) and (b) platinum surface atom in a Pt6 cluster with R = 2.643 Å (dashed line) and in a PtAu5 cluster with R = 2.643 Å (solid line) and with R = 2.717 Å (dashed−dotted line).
The calculated L3 edge of the gold center atom in a Au55 cluster (Figure 6a) reproduced that of the gold foil (Figure 2b), and both exhibited a small white line.40,43,45 An unmistakable white line appeared upon alloying this cluster, and the edge shifted 1.2 eV to lower energy. The intensity of the feature around 15 eV increased when the distances shortened upon alloying but otherwise did not change. The L3 edges of the six-atom gold clusters had less intense features (Figure 6b). Also for the six-atom cluster, a white line appeared in the Au L3 upon replacing all neighboring atoms by platinum and the edge shifted 1 eV to lower energy. As in the bulk cluster, the white-line intensity was significantly higher with the shorter interatomic distances.
The calculated changes in the edges as function of cluster size, alloying, and interatomic distance are summarized in Table 4. Platinum and gold atoms have a different electronic structure when gold atoms surround them than when they have platinum neighbors, and the metal−metal distance also affects the electronic structure. The empty DOS, shown by the white line, of the Pt d band is lower or, in other words, the Pt valence band contains more electrons if a platinum atom has gold neighbors instead of platinum neighbors. The empty DOS of the Au d band increases upon alloying with platinum. The calculated XANES spectra show the redistribution of charge from gold to platinum when alloying these two metals. The distance effects are especially visible between 5 and 20 eV.

In Table 5, the occupation of the Pt and Au 5d, 5f, 6s, and 6p orbitals as calculated with FEFF8 are listed as a function of the cluster size and interatomic distance for the mono- and bimetallic clusters. The orbital occupations of those atoms of which the XANES was discussed are given here. Relativistic effects play a role in the filling of the orbitals. The ideal electron configuration of a platinum atom is [Xe]4f145d96s1 and of a gold atom is [Xe]4f145d106s1. In bulk metal, the electron configurations are different, since bands are formed and s−p−d hybridization of these bands occurs.28,43 Although the extent of the calculated changes is model dependent, the trends are similar to those in the experimental spectra. In the clusters, the electron counts of the 5d and 6s band were less than in the single atom. The electron configuration of the six-atom clusters was closer to the atomic configuration than that of the bulk atom. The total electron count of the platinum atoms was 10 and of the gold atoms was 11, independent of the number of neighbors. The total electron count of the platinum center atom in PtAu54 as calculated by FEFF8 was 10.26. Thus, electrons were transferred from gold to the platinum atom and mainly to the Pt 5d orbital. This agrees with the changes in the white line of the experimental spectra. Although each gold atom transferred on average only 0.005 electrons to platinum, the gold electron configuration moved further away from the atomic gold configuration. The total electron count of a platinum atom in a six-atom cluster increased when gold atoms replaced the five neighboring platinum atoms, which was mainly because of a transfer of electrons to the Pt 5d band. A similar redistribution of electrons in the gold valence bands took place as in the PtAu54 cluster. The total electron count for the center gold atom in AuPt54 was 10.84. Thus, electrons were transferred from the gold atom to platinum and mainly from the 5d band. The Pt 5d band became more filled, whereas the number of electrons in the 6p band decreased. When platinum atoms replaced five of the atoms in Au6, electrons were transferred mainly from the Au 5d and 6s of the remaining gold atom to the Pt 5d.

There was a difference in the calculated electron configurations between the clusters with long and short metal−metal distances. When shortening the distances, thus increasing the orbital overlap, the electron configurations moved further away from the atomic configurations. The Fermi level of the six-atom clusters was higher if the shorter Pt−Pt distances were used compared to the longer distances. These effects of the interatomic distance on the electronic structure of platinum and gold led to the observed differences in the calculated XANES.
The calculated Fermi level (EF) of gold was higher than that of platinum for both the atom in bulk and the six-atom clusters. The center of the Au55 d band was 4.4 eV below EF and that of Pt55 was 2.8 eV below EF. Since the Fermi level of pure gold was higher than that of platinum, EF shifted up when alloying platinum with gold. This concurs with the shift of the Pt L3 edge to higher energy upon alloying. The EF's of PtAu54 and Au55 were basically the same. The shape of the DOS of the Pt 5d band changed upon alloying (Figure 7). The shape of the DOS of the other valence bands changed as well but to a lesser extent than the 5d band. The center of the Pt 5d band shifted 0.4−1 eV up with respect to EF upon alloying, although the d band became more filled. The up shift of the d band was strongest with the longer distances, because the d band was narrower when the metal−metal distances were longer. This narrowing and up shift of the Pt 5d band with increasing distances was also measured for a platinum layer on a gold substrate, and for Pt on Au(111) a shift of the center of the Pt d band with respect to EF of 0.43 eV was found. 46 The shape of the Au d DOS changed upon alloying with platinum, and EF shifted down to nearly the level of bulk platinum. The center of the Au 5d band shifted 0.2 eV up with respect to EF with the long gold−metal distances and shifted 0.2 eV down with the shorter distances. Thus, the effect of platinum on the relative Au d band shift is small most likely because the Au d band is nearly filled.
Figure 7 Calculated density of states (DOS) of the Pt d band in a Pt55 cluster with R = 2.807 Å (dashed line), in a PtAu54 cluster with R = 2.807 Å (solid line) and with R = 2.807 Å (dash-dotted line), and the corresponding Fermi levels of the clusters (vertical lines).
Summarizing, the calculations of the electronic structure show that when platinum and gold are mixed, charge is transferred from the Au 5d band to the Pt 5d band. The shape of the DOS changes and the Fermi level shifts up with respect to that of the pure platinum cluster and down with respect to that of the gold cluster. This is reflected in the XANES by small edge shifts and by a decrease in the Pt L3 white-line intensity and an increase in intensity in the Au L3 white-line region. When alloying platinum and gold, the electronic structures of the two metals look more alike. A contraction of the interatomic distance results in intra-atomic charge redistributions for both platinum and gold, but this distance effect is smaller than the effect of alloying.
4. Discussion
4.1. Geometric Structure. In the EXAFS analysis of platinum−gold catalysts, the number of platinum neighbors and the number of gold neighbors of both metals could not be determined independently as has been done, for example, for PtRe and PdRe catalysts. 47 Comparison of the structural parameters of the PtAu catalysts with those of the platinum and gold catalysts reveals that mixed clusters were formed. In PtAu/SiO2, the platinum to nearest-neighbor distance is 2.78 Å, which lies between that of 2.70 Å in platinum clusters and 2.81 Å in gold clusters of similar size on SiO2. The Au−M distance in PtAu/SiO2 of 2.79 Å is basically the same as the Pt−M distance, and thus platinum and gold are well mixed. The uniform cluster-size distribution as determined with STEM supports this conclusion. Platinum has more nearest neighbors than gold meaning that the surface is gold-enriched, which is expected because gold has a lower surface tension than platinum. The bulk Pt-to-Au ratio is 1:2, and thus the surface platinum content is less than one-third. Since gold is mainly on the cluster surface, there must be only small ensembles of platinum atoms on the surface or even only single atoms. Thus, in addition to electronic effects, ensemble-size effects on the catalytic performance can be expected.
In PtAu/TiO2, the Pt−M interatomic distance is the same as the Pt−Pt distance in Pt/TiO2, that is, 2.75 Å. However, NPt-M is lower than NPt-Pt in Pt/TiO2 (8.3 vs 9.2), and therefore one would actually expect a shorter distance in the first case if only pure platinum clusters would be present. Thus, platinum also has gold neighbors. The Au−M distance of 2.82 Å is smaller than the Au−Au distance of 2.84 Å in Au/TiO2, and thus gold has platinum neighbors. The RPt-M and RAu-M in PtAu/TiO2 are 0.07 Å apart, and thus platinum and gold are incompletely mixed. From STEM, the cluster-size distribution in PtAu/TiO2 is uniform; in the case that all clusters were monometallic, one could expect two maxima. Also on TiO2, mixed clusters are formed, although the presence of pure platinum clusters cannot be ruled out. No indication for surface enrichment was observed.
4.2. Electronic Structure. The electronic structures of platinum and gold depend on the type and number of neighbors (cluster size and shape) and on the interatomic distances. The distance effect is less important than the influence of the type of neighbors. Both the experimental and the calculated spectra show that when studying the electronic structures with XANES spectroscopy, the important features are the edge position, the intensity in the white-line region, and the second feature that appears at 5−20 eV above the edge (Tables 3 and 4). The edge position relates to the Fermi level:  when EF shifts up, the edge position shifts to higher energy. The L3 white-line intensity correlates to the number of holes in the 5d band; a decrease in the white-line intensity means that the 5d band becomes more filled. The intensity of the second feature increases with a shortening of the interatomic distances and also correlates with the number of holes in the d band.
The Pt L3 edge of PtAu/SiO2 shifted to higher energy, and the white line was lower and broader compared to the L3 edge of pure platinum clusters. This indicates that there is an electronic effect. These changes in the experimental near edges are similar to those in the calculations and especially to those with the shorter distances. The decrease in the intensity of the second feature is the same as for the calculation with the longer distances. Thus, there is not only an alloying effect on the electronic structure of platinum, but there is also a distance effect. The Au L3 edge of PtAu/SiO2 is slightly shifted to higher energy compared to that of Au/SiO2. No clear intensity change in the white-line area is observed though the shape is slightly different. The intensity of the second feature also increased, which is a distance effect. The distance effect is the intra-atomic redistribution of charge, which occurs when forcing atoms closer together or further apart.46 There is a small electronic effect of platinum on gold in PtAu/SiO2, which is not as strong as that of gold on platinum, since the clusters contain twice as many gold as platinum atoms. The Pt L3 edge of PtAu/TiO2 is shifted 1 eV to higher energy with respect to that of Pt/TiO2. The white-line intensity and the intensity of the second feature are decreased. Comparing this with the calculated XANES shows that there is an electronic effect on platinum. The Au L3 edge of PtAu/TiO2 lies at slightly lower energy than that of Au/TiO2. However, the intensity in the white-line region is decreased and that of the second feature is higher, which is opposite to what we expect from the calculations. Thus, we see no unambiguous electronic effect on gold in PtAu/TiO2. Combination of the experimental XANES and the calculated electronic structure shows that there is an interatomic redistribution of charge from gold to platinum in supported PtAu catalysts as well as an intra-atomic charge redistribution. Although gold has a higher electronegativity than platinum, gold loses electrons to platinum. This is because the PtAu combination is in the “covalent limit”:  the d bandwidth is much larger than the energy separation of the d bands and platinum and gold tend toward equal electron counts in the alloy. 48
In general, the magnitude of the depletion of the Au 5d band depends strongly on the fraction of empty states in the valence band of the metal with which it is alloyed or on which it is deposited. For gold atoms on Pt(111), it has been shown that there is a net charge transfer from gold to platinum, whereas for Au on Mo(110), there is a charge transfer from molybdenum to gold. 49 The 5d band of the gold atoms on Mo(110) was shifted to higher binding energy and was narrowed with respect to that of gold, reflecting a reduction in the 5d electron population. When gold is deposited on Ru(001), hybridization of the Au 5d and Ru 4d bands leads to an interface hybrid state.44 Both inter- and intra-atomic electron transfers occur. The gold atoms show a reduction in the electron population of the 5d orbitals. This loss of 5d electrons is compensated by a gain in 6s and 6p electrons, and there is a net charge transfer from ruthenium to gold. Hybrid states were also observed for Cu/Ru(001) and bimetallic surfaces that contain gold and palladium but not for gold on the surface of s, p, or early transition metals.44 In Al2Au, gold also acts as a net electron acceptor:  there is an increase in the electron population of the Au 6s and 6p orbitals because of interatomic charge transfer from the Al 3s and 3p and because of intra-atomic charge transfer from the Au 5d to the Au 6s and 6p. 50 Our calculations resulted in similar intra-atomic charge redistributions upon alloying platinum and gold. This charge redistribution for alloys with (nearly) full d bands has often been observed for bulk alloys22,48,51 and is equivalent to the s−p−d hybridization. Even when alloying silver and gold, which both have almost filled d bands, gold gains non-d charge and loses d charge, while silver gains d charge and loses non-d conduction charge. Gold loses 0.18 d electrons in a AuAg19 alloy, whereas the net charge flow is negligibly small.23 The decrease in the Au 5d population, which was observed in all these studies, reduces the electron−electron repulsion within the d shell. This stabilizes the 5d orbitals, which are more compact than the 6s and 6p orbitals and have larger Coulomb interactions with the gold core electrons.44,50 Although the charge transfer upon alloying has often been observed experimentally and is also shown in this work, other authors report that when supporting nickel, palladium, and platinum monolayers on transition metals, the d band fillings of the deposited metals do not change, and only the width and position of the d band change. 52
For polymer-derived PtAu clusters, no electronic perturbations in the XANES and empty d DOS were observed, and these authors proposed a core(Pt)−shell(Au) model for their clusters. 53 In diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) studies, a red shift of 15−20 cm-1 in the frequency of CO adsorbed on SiO2-supported PtAu clusters prepared from the same complex as in this work was found compared to CO adsorbed on a platinum catalyst. It was concluded that platinum and gold are in intimate contact14 and that there is an electronic effect 54 as we also found with XAS. It has been shown that an expansion of the interatomic distance increases the reactivity toward bonding with adsorbates. 46,55 We calculated the same distance effect for platinum, which is enhanced by the electronic effect of alloying with gold.
5. Conclusions
In PtAu/SiO2 and PtAu/TiO2 with a Pt-to-Au ratio of 1:2, the two metals are in close contact. The SiO2-supported PtAu clusters are small (1.5 nm) and well mixed with uniform interatomic distances. The surface is enriched with gold. In the TiO2-supported bimetallic catalyst, the clusters are larger (2−3 nm) and platinum and gold are not completely mixed. Both geometric and electronic effects influence the reactivity. The electronic effect consists of alloying and distance effects, as shown by comparison of the Pt and Au L3 near-edge structures of the mono- and bimetallic clusters aided by theoretical calculations. In both bimetallic catalysts, there is a redistribution of charge; electrons are transferred from the Au 5d to the Pt 5d band. Intra-atomic charge redistribution also occurs. The Fermi levels shift in opposite directions upon alloying platinum with gold and gold with platinum. The Pt 5d band center shifts up with respect to the Fermi level, and the Au 5d band hardly shifts.
