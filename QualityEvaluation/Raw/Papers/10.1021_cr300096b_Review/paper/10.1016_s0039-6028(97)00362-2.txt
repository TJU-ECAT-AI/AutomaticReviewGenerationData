Abstract 
The growth morphology and electronic properties of A1 films on Pt( 111 ) have been investigated by STM, XPS and AES at 160 K 
and 300 K. Film growth is kinetically controlled at both temperatures, with formation of 2D A1 dendrites during the initial stages 
of deposition. At 300 K, completion of the first monolayer is followed by 3D island formation, while at 160 K layer-by-layer growth 
persists for A1 coverages _> 
5 monolayers. Pt core-level and valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectra show growth of a high binding 
energy interfacial Pt state during 300 K deposition, indicative of Pt/A1 surface alloying. No significant alloying occurs during 160 K 
growth. At 300 K, deposition of second-layer A1 signals the onset of adatom place exchange with the underlying Pt, reflecting a 
rather delicate balance between surface energy and free energy of alloy formation. The limiting Pt/AI surface alloy stoichiometry 
corresponds to PtzAls, and the associated Pt core level shift is in quantitative accord with an interesting linear correlation which is 
found between the composition and associated core-level shifts of other Al-transition metal alloys. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction 
Oxide-supported platinum metal catalysts are of 
immense importance. Of these, Pt/alumina is argu- 
ably the most important system, and certainly one 
of the most extensively studied. Their high effi- 
ciency as total oxidation catalysts has led to 
Pt/alumina catalysts playing a key role in pollution 
abatement, especially in regard to hydrocarbon 
combustion. Owing to their versatile surface chem- 
istry, they also constitute the critical component 
in so-called reforming catalysts which are used for

large-scale hydrocarbon processing--the backbone 
of the oil and petrochemicals industries. 
It is well known that Pt aluminide formation 
can occur at the Pt/A12Os interface at the temper- 
atures used for catalyst preparation [ 1 
]. This can 
affect sintering, re-dispersion and adsorbate spillo- 
ver, all of which are important in determining the 
behaviour and practical utility of these materials. 
The properties of the Pt/A1 interface are therefore 
of interest, yet, surprisingly, there have been 
no previous model studies using single crystal 
substrates. A1 deposition on Mo(ll0) [2-4], 
Ag(lll),(ll0) [5,6], Ru(0001) [7-9], Re(1010) 
[10] and Ta(ll0) [11] have been reported, and 
Rodriguez and Kuhn have studied Pt deposition 
on Mo(ll0)-supported A1 thin films [12]. Alloy

formation under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) condi- 
tions has been reported for thin A1 films grown on 
Ru(0001) [7,8] and thin film alloys between A1 
and Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pd and Pt [13-17] have also 
been studied. 
Our earlier work on the Pt(lll)/A1Ox model 
planar system under UHV conditions [18] pro- 
vided fundamentally useful insight regarding the 
effect of SO2 in promoting alkane oxidation over 
dispersed Pt/alumina catalysts [19]. The present 
paper is similarly motivated: we focus on the Pt/A1 
interface and associated alloying processes. 
sitated A1 deposition in the sample preparation 
chamber with the Pt substrate at 160 K. This was 
followed by rapid sample transfer via a pre-cooled 
wobblestick into the cooled (100 K) STM stage. 
The total temperature rise during this transfer, 
estimated from calibration experiments using an 
identical sample-holder with integral thermo- 
couple, was <40 K. 
3. Results 
2. Experimental 
Photoemission experiments were carried out in 
a UHV chamber operated at base pressures of 
1 x 10- lo Torr [20]. The Pt(111) sample could be 
heated resistively to 1200 K, and cooled to 150 K. 
Cleaning was achieved by cycles of Ar ÷ sputtering 
(6 x 10 .2 A m -2, 
500 eV) 
and 
annealing 
at 
1000 K, until LEED/Auger analysis indicated a 
well-ordered surface, free from contaminants. 
Oxygen treatment (800 K, 1 x 10 .8 Torr) followed 
by thermal desorption was used as a sensitive test 
for the absence of C--diagnosed by subsequent 
desorption of O2 and the absence of CO or CO2 
desorption. X-ray photoelectron (XP) spectra were 
obtained in a VSW ARIES system equipped with 
an HA100 spectrometer with both analyser and 
excitation (Mg Ks) source at 45 ° to the surface 
normal. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) 
measurements were carried out with an Omicron 
UHV 
VT-STM 
system 
(base 
pressure 
4x 
10-nTorr) equipped with LEED and Auger 
electron spectroscopy capabilities. STM images 
were obtained at 120 K and 300 K in constant 
current (topographic) mode with an electrochemi- 
cally etched W tip, biased between + 100 mV and 
+ 2 V with tunnel currents from 0.5 to 5 nA. 
A1 (Goodfellows 99.99%) was deposited using a 
well-collimated evaporation source described pre- 
viously [21]; this provided highly reproducible 
deposition rates of ~0.15 monolayer (ML) per 
minute. A monolayer is defined as the number of 
adatoms required for completion of a continuous 
overlayer film. STM of cold-deposited films neces- 
3.1. Auger spectroscopy 
The growth of A1 was characterised at substrate 
temperatures of 160, 300 and 800 K by following 
the electron-excited Pt Auger transitions at 43 eV 
and 64 eV kinetic energy. The main A1 Auger line 
at 66 eV cannot be resolved from the intense Pt 
64 eV line, hence the A1 Auger uptake growth 
characteristics were determined from the attenua- 
tion of the Pt 43 eV transition. 
A1 growth on Pt(111) is dependent strongly on 
substrate 
temperature 
(Fig. 1), 
the 
rate 
of 
attenuation of substrate features being faster at 
lower deposition temperatures. Deposition of A1 
at 160 K resulted in a continuous, exponential 
decay of the Pt 43 eV signal, which was completely 
attenuated after ~ 70 min deposition time. The A1 
66 eV transition became visible after ~ 160min 
deposition. Raising the deposition temperature to 
300 K resulted in a linear decrease in the Pt 43 eV 
Auger intensity up to a breakpoint at ~ 15 min A1 
deposition. This breakpoint corresponds to ~48% 
attenuation of the Pt 43 eV signal, and is assigned 
to completion of an A1 monolayer (see below). 
Further A1 deposition induced continued attenua- 
tion of the Pt signal, though now at a much slower 
rate than that observed during 160 K deposition. 
This slower attenuation beyond ~ 15 rain A1 at 
300 K could be accounted for by a change in 
growth mode (e.g. agglomeration/3D crystallite 
growth), and/or intermixing at the Pt/A1 interface. 
Support for the latter possibility is obtained from 
A1 growth data acquired at 800 K which show that 
under these conditions attenuation of the Pt 43 eV 
signal is extremely slow (only 30% attenuation

alent to ~ 6 ML A1.) 
For the thickest A1 deposits investigated at 
300 K and 800 K (180 min, ~ 12 ML), attenuation 
of the Pt Auger lines was accompanied by a large 
shift in the 64 eV peak position to ~61 eV. No 
such 
shifts were observed during 
160K 
A1 
deposition. 
3.2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) 
Valence-band and core-level spectra of the 
A1/Pt(111) system were recorded at deposition 
temperatures of 160 K and 300 K. The Pt 4f and 
4d spin-orbit doublets and the A1 2s transitions at 
72/75 eV, 316/334 eV and 119 eV binding energy 
(BE) respectively, were recorded at 44 eV pass 
energy. The more surface-sensitive A1 2p doublet 
at 73/74 eV BE [22] could not be resolved from 
the strong Pt 4fs/2 transition with which it overlaps.

A1 deposition at 160 K and 300 K. At 160 K the

Pt 4f BEs exhibit a small increase (~0.4 eV). At 
300 K broadening of both Pt 4f peaks to higher 
BE was apparent after only ~ 10 min deposition, 
and, as the A1 dose was increased further, the shift 
in the composite Pt emission increased to a limiting 
value of ~ 1.1 eV after 160 min. At both deposition 
temperatures the attenuation of the Pt 4f XP signal 
followed qualitatively that of the more surface- 
sensitive 43 eV Pt Auger emission. 
Evolution of the valence band spectra with A1 
deposition was also strongly temperature depen- 
dent. During 300 K deposition the intense Pt 5d 
band continuously narrowed and shifted to higher 
BE. In contrast, A1 deposition at 160 K only 
attenuated the substrate valence band features 
without inducing any detectable shifts. This differ- 
ence is illustrated in Fig. 4 for identical thick A1 
deposits at substrate temperatures of 160 K and 
300 K.

after deposition of 160 min A1 at 160 and 300 K. 
The temperature dependence of the Pt 4f BEs 
was examined further by monitoring the 4f peak 
position as a 160 K deposited thick (>5 ML) A1 
film was annealed progressively to 350 K (1 min 
at each temperature), Fig. 5. At 270 K, both 4f 
components broadened to higher BE, evolving into 
sharp peaks at 72.8 and 76 eV after 350 K annea- 
ling. These new states are shifted by ~ 1.4 eV to 
higher BE with respect to those of clean Pt(111 ), 
suggesting strong electronic perturbation of the 
substrate due to interdiffusion of A1 and Pt during 
the annealing process. 
The A1 2s region was also examined as the 160 K 
deposited A1 film was annealed to 270 K and 
350 K; the results are shown in Fig. 6. While the 
low photoionisation cross-section of A12s [23] 
renders this signal relatively insensitive during ini- 
tial growth, it is apparent that the sharp peak 
observed at 119 eV BE from a thick 160 K deposit 
broadens towards higher BE on annealing to 
270 K. Further annealing to 350 K reduced the 2s 
peak intensity, with the peak centroid now occur- 
ring at ~ 119.7 eV. 
3.3. STM 
Fig. 7(a) (d) shows the surface morphology as 
a function of At film growth at room temperature. 
At all submonolayer coverages examined, the A1 
overlayer formed single layer islands exhibiting 
irregular dendritic shapes. The island shape indi- 
cates that edge diffusion of atoms around the 
islands is limited, an effect observed previously in 
other bimetallic systems [8]. As the nominal A1 
coverage increased, the dendrite size also increased 
(Fig. 7(b)), eventually resulting in island coal- 
escence. After completion of the first monolayer, 
the surface became rougher, with multilayers of 
different thickness co-existing within a given sub-

such a terrace is depicted in Fig. 8 between the 
points A and B of Fig. 7(d): this shows the 
co-existence of at least three different thickness 
atomic layers above the substrate. 
A1 was also deposited onto the Pt substrate at 
160 K, and the resulting morphology is shown in 
Fig. 9. It can be seen that the same A1 flux at this 
temperature produces a much higher nucleation 
density of smaller 2D islands within the submono-

play a key role in controlling the metal particle 
dispersion 
and 
support-wetting 
properties 
of 
Pt/AlzO3 catalysts. Furthermore, Pt 'A1 intermixing 
may strongly modify the type and number of 
catalytically active ensembles on the surface of the 
metal phase. These structural properties are linked 
to the electronic properties of alumina-supported 
Pt particles and to the origin of strong metal sup- 
port interactions (SMSI), often neglected for alu- 
mina-based 
systems. 
These 
factors 
are 
now 
considered in turn. 
4.1. Growth morphology 
The Auger uptake data presented in Fig. 1 indi- 
cate that growth of A1 on Pt(lll) is kinetically 
controlled. For systems where simple overlayer 
growth occurs at ambient temperatures, lower 
deposition temperatures are expected to reduce 
both interlayer and intralayer adatom mobilities,

(e.g. agglomeration of A1 islands and re-exposure 
of substrate features) and/or intermixing of the

component metals on heating. The XP spectra 
presented in Figs. 2 and 3 provide strong evidence 
for the latter: both A1 and Pt exhibit strong 
electronic perturbation at ~ 300 K, best accounted 
for by formation of an interfacial Pt/A1 alloy [ 12]. 
Furthermore, our STM measurements show no 
evidence for agglomeration of thick A1 deposits, 
and consequent re-exposure of the substrate, at 
elevated temperatures. 
Quantitative analysis of the Pt Auger data gives 
additional insight into the A1 growth mode. The 
Pt Auger intensity IML(Pt) due to attenuation by 
an homogeneous A1 overlayer of thickness t is 
given by the following formula [25]. where 0 is

where 2pt(E43) represents the inelastic mean-free 
path of 43 eV photoelectrons. Treating the over- 
layer thickness and )~Pt as adjustable parameters, 
best fits to the 160 K uptake curve in Fig. 1 are 
obtained for an A1 interlayer spacing of ~2.33 ,~ 
and J~pt(E43) of ~4.9A. These values are in 
excellent agreement with the bulk f.c.c. AI(111) 
interlayer separation [26] and semi-empirical cal- 
culations [27] of the Pt 43 eV mean-free path. The 
good fit of the calculated attenuation over the 
entire coverage regime investigated demonstrates 
that A1 films grow in a layer-by-layer (Frank van 
de Merwe) fashion on Pt(111) at 160K for at 
least 6 ML. Furthermore, the Pt attenuation of 
52% at 
~12min AI deposition can now be 
assigned to completion of the first A1 monolayer 
(i.e. ~ 1 x 1015 atoms cm-2). 
For the same deposition rate, but at 300 K, 
12 min ( 1 ML) of A1 deposition results in compara- 
ble (~48%) attenuation of the Pt 43 eV signal with 
that observed at 160 K. However, beyond this 
coverage the 300 K uptake plot shows a break and 
subsequent slower attenuation. This is consistent 
both with the transition from 2D to 3D island 
growth observed by STM (Fig. 7(d)), and the 
onset of Pt/A1 intermixing indicated by XPS. The 
slight discrepancy between the monolayer attenua- 
tions at 160 K and 300 K may reflect limited Pt/A1 
intermixing towards completion of the monolayer, 
at a level undetectable by STM. 
The coincidence of second-layer A1 growth and 
interfacial Pt/AI intermixing growth suggests that 
the surface energies of the component metals play 
a key role in determining the multilayer growth 
mode. The much lower surface free energy of A1 
relative to Pt (1.2 vs. 2.55Jcm -2) favours AI 
overlayer growth during the first monolayer at 
both 160 K and 300 K, and in both cases A1 grows 
as highly dendritic islands possessing a fractal 
(Hausdorff) parameter of ~1.4. In this regime. 
where A1 adatom diffusion about the perimeter of 
nucleation sites is activated with respect to A1 
diffusion across Pt terraces, it is anticipated that 
Pt/A1 interlayer place exchange will also be kineti- 
cally disfavoured. These kinetic arguments are 
supported by annealing experiments discussed else- 
where [27], which reveal the gradual transfor- 
mation from dendritic to spherical/hexagonal 2D 
islands possessing fractal dimensions of ~2. 
Subsequent deposition of A1 multilayers lifts the 
surface energy restrictions on intermixing of under- 
lying A1 atoms at the Pt (111)/A1 interface; their 
behaviour now becomes governed by both thermo- 
dynamic and kinetic considerations. 
In the present case, A1 Pt alloying is thermody- 
namically favourable, with enthalpies of intermix- 
ing ranging from ~57 100 kJmo1-1 [28]. It has 
been reported for Pt deposition on A1 films sup- 
ported on Mo(110) [ 12], and for thick A1 deposits 
(~ 2000 A) on silica-supported Pt films [29]. Many 
stable well-ordered bulk alloy phases are known,

and 
A1Pt3 
being those most commonly observed [30]. The 
absence of significant alloying at 160 K and the 
higher density of nucleation centres observed by 
STM are consistent with kinetically limited A1 
growth. The increased density of smaller dendritic 
A1 islands at 160 K, compared with 300 K, reflects 
the reduced rate of inter-island A1 diffusion (i.e. 
shorter mean-free paths). In addition, it seems 
plausible that the mean detachment energy of 
island edge atoms is smaller for small islands than 
for large ones. Lower temperatures would, there- 
fore, also tend to disfavour growth of large islands 
at the expense of small islands. 
Strain energies arising during overlayer growth 
can drive intermixing at the surface of a two

265 
component system [31], even where the compo- 
nents do not form bulk alloys and have a large 
atomic size mismatch [32]. Tersoff's calculations 
show that when the strain energy of a pseudomor- 
phic film becomes greater than that of the corre- 
sponding surface alloy, place-exchange will be 
favoured. The only exception occurs if the over- 
layer thickness can be made sufficiently large so 
that the strain in the film is relaxed through 
step/kink formation, The 4% compressive strain 
present during growth of the first A1 monolayer 
on Pt(lll) may also promote the observed den- 
drite formation by reducing the barrier for terrace 
diffusion [33] relative to island edge diffusion, 
which is dominated by the strong interplanar 
A1-A1 cohesive energy [8]. 
The attenuation of substrate photoemission fea- 
tures which accompany alloying indicates that a 
significant surface A1 concentration is retained at 
300 K, possibly as a terminating layer and/or 
within the 3D crystallites, in accord with surface 
energy predictions. Indeed, at 300 K it was not 
possible to achieve a limiting Pt surface concen- 
tration, even for the longest A1 deposition times, 
confirming that A1 diffusion into the Pt bulk 
proceeds slowly even at this temperature. In con- 
trast, high-temperature A1 growth favours equili- 
bration of the surface composition after ~ 6 ML 
A1. The associated limiting Pt Auger attenuation 
of ~30% is consistent with a Pt-rich selvedge, 
although the converse appears true during 300 K 
A1 growth, as discussed later. 
4.2. Electronicproperties 
of Pt( 
lll)/Al 
films 
The Pt XP emission shows no evidence of 
electronic perturbation during the initial stages of 
A1 deposition at temperatures _< 
300 K, consistent 
with the growth of a weakly interacting 2D A1 
overlayer. Larger A1 coverages at higher temper- 
atures (>270 K) induce 3D island growth accom- 
panied by strong perturbation of the Pt 4f and 
valence-band XP regions. 
These changes cannot simply reflect electronic 
modification of the underlying Pt by an A1 over- 
layer due to charge-redistribution or by lifting of 
the Pt SCLS. If this were the case, maximum 
perturbation of the Pt emission would be expected 
at ~ 1 ML A1 at both 160 K and 300 K. In fact, 
the perturbation is undetectable up to the mono- 
layer point at both temperatures, and at 300 K its 
magnitude increases with A1 deposition for cover- 
ages > 10 ML. These observations suggest that, at 
300 K, extended continuous place-exchange of the 
two components occurs. Narrowing of the Pt 5d 
band (300 K alloying, Fig. 4) may be attributed 
to the reduced Pt-Pt orbital overlap arising from 
the presence of intervening A1 neighbours. 
This hypothesis is Supported by annealing 
studies on 160 K deposited A1 films, which show 
the growth of a new high BE Pt 4f state at ~ 300 K, 
consistent with previous core-level shifts observed 
for Pt/A1 alloys [ 12]. The concomitant rise in A12s 
BE during annealing also supports A1 migration 
from a pure A1 environment at 160 K to within a 
Pt/A1 alloy at 300 K. Peak profile analysis of both 
Pt 4d and 4f XP spectra confirms the presence of 
a high BE state. Although the A1 2p and Pt 4f 
emissions overlap, the relative absorption cross- 
sections of A12p and Pt 4f excited by Mg Ks 
radiation are 0.012 MBarn and 0.379 MBarn [23] 
respectively, hence the A1 2p contribution to this 
new state is negligible for the coverages used in 
this study. However, to eliminate possible overlap 
contributions, the attenuation of the Pt 4d clean 
surface spectrum was used to calculate the bulk Pt 
contribution to the Pt 4f spectra, taking account 
of the different inelastic mean-free paths of 
937.5 eV and 1182 eV kinetic energy electrons 
(~21.5A and 24A respectively). Fig. 10 shows 
the results obtained for deposition of 180 min A1 
at 300 K, where the composite peak clearly com- 
prises an attenuated bulk signal and a new inter- 
facial Pt state at ~ 1.4 eV higher BE. 
The direction and magnitude of the 300 K XP 
core-level shifts and the corresponding evolution 
of the valence-band structure are consistent with 
Pt/A1 alloy formation. The respective Pt and A1 
Pauling electronegativities of 2.28 and 1.61 [34] 
suggest that charge donation from AI~Pt should 
occur within such alloys. Initial-state arguments 
suggest that the Pt core-level BEs should, therefore, 
decrease upon alloying, in contrast to the observed 
increase. Rodriguez and Kuhn [12] attribute this 
positive Pt core level shift, in supported thin- 
film Pt/A1 alloys, to charge transfer from the

A1 3s,p~Pt 6s,p bands, accompanied by charge 
redistribution 
between 
the 
Pt 5d-+6s,p 
and 
A1 3s~3p bands. The resultant intermetallic bond- 
ing is thought to localise electron density between 
the two metal centres, thus increasing the core- 
level BEs on both Pt and A1. On an atomic level, 
5d orbitals shield the 4f orbitals from the Pt core 
[35], while the 5d band is also principally responsi- 
ble for final-state screening of 4f core-holes within 
bulk Pt [36]. Hence the net reduction (and con- 
comitant stabilisation) of the Pt 5d valence-band 
population accompanying this A1-Pt bimetallic 
bonding reduces both initial-state shielding of 4f 
electrons, and final-state screening of 4f core-holes, 
contributing to the observed positive Pt core-level 
shift. Similar positive BE shifts have been observed 
during surface alloy formation between A1 and 
several other transition metals, including A1/Au 
[13], Pd/AI(lll) [37], Pd/AI(ll0) [381, and 
Ni/AI(110) [39]. 
The Pt/A1 alloy composition may be estimated 
from the Pt XP deconvolution and peak shifts as 
follows. The strong attenuation of substrate photo- 
emission features for thick room-temperature A1 
deposits are generally consistent with either an 
Al-rich selvedge, or the presence of a layered 
alloy/capping A1 overlayer structure: The observa- 
tion of a single well-defined Pt alloy state in Fig. 10 
favours the presence of a single, homogeneous 
alloy phase over alternatives such as a gradated 
Pt/A1 alloy with A1 content increasing towards the 
surface. Further analysis of Pt spectral intensities 
is complicated by the transition from 2D to 3D 
island growth beyond 1 ML, precisely the region 
where electronic perturbation of Pt becomes 
resolvable. Above 1 ML, the reduced Pt core-level 
and Auger intensities, relative to those predicted 
by Eq. (1), thus reflect both alloying and morpho- 
logical contributions. In contrast, the limiting Pt 4f 
core-level shift for thick A1 deposits offers a semi- 
quantitative guide to the equilibrium 300 K Pt/A1 
alloy composition. 
A survey of the literature reveals that for bulk 
M~ly alloys (M=Pd, Au, Ni) the core-level BEs 
of M exhibit an interesting linear dependence on 
alloy composition for AI:M ratios between 0.1 to 
3. Rodriguez and Kuhn report that the Pt core- 
level BE shift for the A1/Pt/Mo(ll0) system 
increases with Pt:A1 ratio from ~0.87eV for 
Pto.6Alo. 
4 to ~ 1.16 eV for Pt0.4Alo. 
6 surface alloys 
[!2]. On this basis, the 1.4 eV shift observed here 
is consistent with a random substitutional alloy 
phase of approximate composition Pt2A13, which 
is one of the most thermodynamically favoured 
cases (AHf=--79 kJ mol-1). Such an interfacial 
Pt2A13 alloy phase was observed by RBS/XRD 
following low temperature (~ 500 K) annealing of 
thick (1100 A) A1 films evaporated onto a 2500 
SiO2-supported Pt film [29]. The limiting alloy 
composition at 300 K may also be estimated, 
assuming a single homogeneous alloy phase, by 
comparing the (sensitivity corrected) A12s and 
deconvoluted Pt 4f alloy signals from a 180 min 
deposit. This procedure yields an approximate 
alloy composition of 70% A1 and 30% Pt, corre- 
sponding to PtA12. However, the proposed A1 
K. Wilson et al. / Surface Science 387 (1997) 257 268 
267 
capping layer would make an additional contribu- 
tion to the A1 signal. Thus, this estimated (A1 rich) 
composition is in good accord with the Pt2A13 
stoichiometry predicted above on the basis of the 
observed BE shift. This interfacial Pt2A13 surface 
alloy may evolve either directly on completion of 
the A1 monolayer, resulting in alloy islands of a 
constant composition, or via a more (A1) dilute 
alloy formed during the onset of intermixing. 
Future high-resolution photoemission measure- 
ments should allow us to distinguish between these 
two processes. A progressive shift in the clean Pt 
4f surface core-level emission through the bulk 
transition towards high BE would indicate a vary- 
ing alloy composition; simultaneous attenuation 
of the Pt surface state and the emergence of a new 
high BE alloy state would indicate continuous 
thickening of a constant composition surface alloy. 
5. Conclusions 
(1) The growth of A1 films on Pt(lll) is kineti- 
cally controlled at both 160 K and 300 K. In the 
submonolayer regime the rates of A1 terrace diffu- 
sion are higher than for diffusion about the perime- 
ter 
of 
adsorbate 
islands 
at 
both 
substrate 
temperatures, resulting in formation of 2D den- 
dritic islands. These dendritic A1 islands are stable 
towards interracial intermixing over the experimen- 
tal timescale. 
(2) A1 films continue to grow in a layer-by-layer 
fashion on Pt(lll) for >5 ML at 160 K without 
evidence for any significant Pt/A1 intermixing. In 
contrast, photoemission data show that, at 300 K, 
deposition of second-layer A1 induces significant 
adatom place exchange with the underlying Pt. 
This reflects a balance between surface energy and 
free energy of alloy formation. 
(3) The interfacial alloy formed corresponds to 
PtzA13, which is also the most thermodynamically 
stable bulk phase. 
(4) An interesting linear correlation between the 
composition and associated core-level shifts of 
various Al-noble metal alloys is found. The 300 K 
Pt/A1 interfacial alloy assigned to PtzA13 is in 
quantitative accord with this correlation.
