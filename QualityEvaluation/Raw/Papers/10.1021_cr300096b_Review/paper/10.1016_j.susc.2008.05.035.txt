Effect of hydrocarbon chain length and cyclization on the adsorption strength of unsaturated hydrocarbons on Pt/3d bimetallic surfaces
Abstract
Pt-based 3d bimetallic surfaces are known to display higher activities and/or selectivities for various important surface reactions. They exhibit properties that can be entirely different from the parent metal surfaces. Various linear and cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons were examined over a range of Pt bimetallic surfaces in the present work to help understand the influence of the adsorbate structure and the electronic structure of bimetallic surface on their adsorption properties and reactivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the binding of these molecules on the 3d-Pt(1 1 1) surface (over-layer structure) and Pt–3d-Pt (subsurface) structure. The effect of hydrocarbon chain length as well as cyclization was also studied on these surfaces. The DFT results for linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene) showed that the binding energies of these molecules decreased as the d-band centers moved away from the Fermi level, for 3d as well as 5d surfaces. Cyclohexene adsorption and reactivity were also studied using both theory and experiments. Cyclohexene adsorbed in a boat-type configuration and bonded weakly to the surface as compared to 1-hexene. Benzene adsorption was investigated on the bridge as well as the hollow adsorption sites. Benzene bonded more weakly than 1-hexene and cyclohexene on the subsurface Pt–3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic structures.
1. Introduction
The catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of linear, branched and cyclic olefins over supported metals and alloys are critical elementary steps in a wide range of hydrocarbon conversion
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
. Both experiment and theory have suggested that the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activity can be correlated with relative strength of adsorption of these hydrocarbon intermediates
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
. Pallassanna and Neurock for example, have shown that the elementary barriers for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of ethylene can be correlated with the adsorption energy of ethylene as well as with the d-band center of the metal
[8]
. The changes in the molecular structure of the hydrocarbon as well as changes in the electronic structure of the metal can lead to systematic changes in the heat of adsorption as well as similar corresponding changes in the activation barriers for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. The understanding of how changes in the geometric structure of the adsorbate and electronic changes in the metal as the result of moving to bimetallic surfaces would aid in the development of structure-property relationships. Pt as well as Pt-based alloys are used throughout the petrochemical industry to carry out both hydrogenation as well as dehydrogenation reactions. While there are a wide range of different experimental and theoretical studies on clean Pt surfaces for specific molecules, there have been no systematic analyses carried out to determine the influence of the hydrocarbon structure or the electronic structure of the metal on adsorption properties that occur over bimetallic surfaces. We present herein first a brief review of the experimental and theoretical work for olefin adsorption that has been carried out over Pt and Pt based alloys.
A number of both theoretical and experimental studies have been carried out to elucidate the trends in the adsorption of linear and cyclic alkenes on monometallic surfaces. Delbecq and Sautet carried out some of the first theoretical studies on Pt(1 1 1) to determine the adsorption structures of ethylene and propene
[5]
. They suggest that propene binds more weakly than ethylene due to Pauli repulsion that results between the methyl group and the surface. Valcarcel et al. reported DFT studies comparing the binding of 1-butene and cis and trans 2-butene on Pt(1 1 1) and Pd(1 1 1)
[11]
. Their results indicated that on both surfaces 1-butene binds more strongly than either of the 2-butene isomers. Vanhove et al. examined the influence of the position of the double bond on the low-temperature chemistry of hexenes
[12]
. In addition to linear alkenes, a number of studies have been reported on the binding and reaction pathways of cyclic molecules. Saeys et al., for example, used theory to investigate the adsorption of cyclohexene on the Pt(1 1 1) surface
[13]
. and showed that the boat di-σ configuration with the CH2-groups pointing away from the surface is the preferred binding configuration for cyclohexene. They subsequently analyzed the adsorption of benzene on Pt(1 1 1) and found that the bridge site was the preferred adsorption site on Pt(1 1 1)
[14]
,
[15]
. In the bridge configuration, benzene binds with four di-σ and two π bonds to the metal surface.
In contrast to the significant body of work on the chemisorption of these unsaturated hydrocarbons on single metal surfaces, very few studies have focused on adsorption on bimetallic surfaces. Bimetallic surfaces can exhibit very different properties as compared to the parent metal surfaces
[16]
,
[17]
,
[18]
,
[19]
. Platinum based bimetallics are the most well studied alloy surfaces due to their importance in hydrocarbon processing as well as their applications in fuel cells. For example, when Pt(1 1 1) is alloyed with a 3d transition metal, such as the Pt–3d-Pt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, the Pt d-band is broadened and lowered in energy, resulting in weaker binding of adsorbates
[20]
,
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
. We have previously examined the adsorption of C2 hydrocarbons on a variety of bimetallic surfaces using DFT
[24]
. Two types of bimetallic surface structures were considered herein, surface monolayer 3d metal on the parent metal surface, designated (3d-Pt–Pt), and subsurface 3d metal layer sandwiched between the first two layers of the parent metal surface, designated (Pt–3d-Pt). Ethylene was found to bind weakly on the subsurface bimetallics compared to the parent metal surfaces, whereas its binding was stronger on the surface bimetallics than on Pt(1 1 1). Koel and co-workers investigated the adsorption and decomposition of ethylene, propene and isobutylene on the (2 × 2) and (√3 × √3)R30° Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloys using experimental techniques
[25]
. Their studies indicated that for all three alkenes, Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloys showed weaker chemisorption and strongly suppressed decomposition. Khan et al. have investigated the hydrogenation of cyclohexene on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces
[26]
. They found that the reaction pathways for cyclohexene were modified significantly on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface compared to the pure Ni(1 1 1) surface. Cyclohexene underwent dehydrogenation and decomposition to form C6H6 on Ni(1 1 1), whereas upon adding Pt to the Ni(1 1 1) surface, a fraction of cyclohexene underwent self-hydrogenation (disproportionation reaction) to form cyclohexane.
In addition, experimental studies by Murillo et al. have probed the trend in the adsorption and reaction of linear alkenes with different chain length on Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces
[9]
. Their results indicate that 1-hexene and cyclohexene show similar self-hydrogenation activities on Ni/Pt surfaces, while self-hydrogenation does not occur for 1-butene or ethylene. Calculations by Delbecq and Sautet suggest that the presence of methyl groups induced a uniform decrease in the binding energy of the C2–C4 alkenes, both on Pt and Pd
[27]
. In contrast, experimental results from Teplyakov et al. indicated that an increase of the linear hydrocarbon chain length by one methylene group typically increased the binding energy by 1.5 kcal/mol on the Cu(1 0 0) surface
[28]
.
In the current work, we examine the adsorption of several linear and cyclic hydrocarbons on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces to help elucidate the effects of adsorbate structure and the electronic properties of the metal on the adsorption behavior of these substrates. This is an extension of our previous DFT studies of C2 hydrocarbons on bimetallic surfaces to include longer hydrocarbon molecules (C4–C6). The bimetallics considered in this study are comprised of a Pt(1 1 1) substrate together with a 3d transition metal (Ni, Co, Cu, Fe) layer placed either in the surface (3d-Pt–Pt) or directly subsurface (Pt–3d-Pt). The linear alkenes examined were 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene and the cyclic molecules were cyclohexene and benzene. There are no systematic theoretical studies that report on the general trends on the binding energies for higher alkenes over bimetallic surfaces. More specifically we analyze herein the binding energies for a series of linear alkenes from C2 to C6, together with that for cyclohexene over different bimetallic substrates. The results show a general correlation between alkene binding energies and the calculated d-band center of bimetallic surfaces, which should ultimately aid in the rational design of bimetallic surfaces to carry out specific reactions.
2. Methods
2.1. Density functional theory
The adsorption of various linear and cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons on transition metal surfaces was studied using nono-local gradient corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) was used to carry out self-consistent periodic slab calculations to obtain all theoretical results presented. VASP solves the Kohn–Sham equations using a planewave basis set
[29]
,
[30]
,
[31]
. The core electrons and the nuclei of the atoms are described by a Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotential
[32]
,
[33]
. The calculations were carried out using a plane wave cut off of 396 eV for all of the atoms. A 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grid was used for Brillouin-zone integration
[34]
. The PW91 form of the generalized gradient approximation was used to calculate the exchange and correlation effects.
Calculations were performed on metallic slabs containing four atomic layers using a 3 × 3 super cell. Unless noted otherwise, the calculations carried out herein were all done at 1/9 ML. The top two layers of the slabs as well as the adsorbate molecules were allowed to relax during geometry optimization whereas the bottom two layers of the slab were held fixed to the bulk lattice positions. Four layers were found to provide reliable tradeoff between the accuracy necessary and the time to carry out the calculations. Previous work indicates that even three metal layer slabs can adequately model both the structural effects including surface segregation and surface relaxation as well as the energies
[20]
,
[21]
,
[22]
,
[24]
. A vacuum region of width equivalent to that of six metal layers was used to separate the slabs in order to avoid any electronic interactions between them.
In order to determine whether the (3 × 3) super cell with a coverage of 1/9 ML was sufficiently large enough to provide the low coverage non-interacting adsorption energies, we have performed comparative calculations for binding of 1-hexene on the Pt(1 1 1) surface using a (4 × 4) super cell for a surface coverage of 1/16 ML. The results indicate that that the change in the adsorption energy is less than 0.01 eV which clearly suggests that there is very little difference between the two super cells structures. We previously demonstrated that the variation in the binding energy of atomic oxygen was found to be less than 0.01 eV as the number of k-points were varied between 5 to 25
[35]
. The calculations for gas-phase species were carried out spin-polarized, whereas the calculations for the adsorbate–metal system were carried out spin unpolarized, since the effect of polarization in the adsorption energies was found to be less than 5 kJ/mol for representative surfaces, such as ethylene on Ni(1 1 1) and Pt–Ni–Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. The binding energy for ethylene on Ni(1 1 1) was calculated to be 0.625 eV when carried out spin-polarized and 0.622 eV for the spin unpolarized system. The difference in the two values is 0.003 eV (0.29 kJ/mol). This is also consistent with previous calculations for the binding energies of atomic H and O on a wide range of bimetallic surfaces
[21]
. Results from these studies have shown that the trend in the binding energy vs. d-band center does not change with or without the inclusion of spin polarization.
The binding energy of a molecule was calculated as
where
is the total energy of the slab with the molecule adsorbed on it, Eslab is the energy of the bare slab and Emolecule is the gas-phase energy of the molecule.
In order to compare the changes in the adsorption energies over different bimetallic surfaces we examined the electronic properties of the metal surface. More specifically, we calculate the d-band center as it has proven to be quite effective in capturing the changes in the electronic structure of the surface which influence the heats of adsorption. The d-band center is defined as the average energy of the d-band and is thus calculated as the first moment of the projected density of states (DOS) on the surface atoms with reference to the Fermi level. The d-band centers were calculated here by carrying out separate spin-polarized calculations for all of the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces considered. The binding energy of the alkene adsorbates has two components, one from the coupling of the metal s states and one due to the extra coupling of the metal d-states
[36]
. However, the contribution due to the coupling of the s states is approximately the same for each of the metal surfaces considered and hence the trends in the adsorption are largely governed by coupling to the metal d-states. This coupling involves the entire d-band
[23]
,
[36]
. As illustrated by Hammer and Norskov, the value of the surface d-band center, or the average energy of the d-band, is often a useful parameter to correlate the d-band structure of the surfaces with the adsorption energies of a wide range of adsorbates. The reactivity of metal surfaces can also be correlated with their d-band centers
[8]
,
[24]
. Hence, such correlations can potentially provide knowledge of the desired electronic structure of the catalysts.
2.2. Preparation of bimetallic surfaces and TPD measurements
Experimental studies were performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 1 × 10−10 Torr. This chamber is equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for TPD experiments. A Pt(1 1 1) single crystal disk (99.999%, Metal Crystals and Oxides, Ltd., Cambridge), 12 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thickness, was spot welded directly to two tantalum posts. The crystal could be resistively heated with a DC power supply to 1100 K, or cooled with liquid nitrogen to temperatures approaching 100 K. By spot welding a thermocouple to the back of the Pt(1 1 1) crystal, and connecting this signal to a feedback controller, the crystal temperature could be accurately monitored and controlled.
Prior to each experiment, the crystal was cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This was followed by oxygen dosing (1 × 10−8 Torr for 50 s, or 0.5 L) at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min. The bimetallic surfaces were prepared by depositing 3d transition metals using physical vapor deposition. This was accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm thick wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(1 1 1) single crystal upon resistively heating the filament with a DC power supply. Tungsten and all 3d metal wires were purchased from Alfa Aesar, and were 99.95+% pure. When the temperature of the Pt(1 1 1) surface is maintained at 300 K during deposition, the 3d metal remains on the surface. On the other hand, if the crystal temperature is elevated to 600 K during deposition, the 3d metal starts to diffuse, resulting in the first atomic layer being enriched in Pt and the second atomic layer consisting of predominantly the 3d metal

[39]
,
[40]
,
[41]
,
[42]
,
[43]
,
[44]
,
[45]
. This was previously demonstrated for Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and the Co/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces.
In the current study, the notation 3d-Pt–Pt(1 1 1) is used to denote 1 monolayer (ML) of the 3d metal residing on top of the Pt(1 1 1) surface, which can be prepared by depositing 1 ML of metal at 300 K. The other bimetallic surface structure considered is Pt–3d-Pt(1 1 1), or a subsurface configuration, which is prepared by depositing 1 ML of the 3d metal at 600 K.
After synthesizing the bimetallic surfaces, cyclohexene (c-C6H10), (Aldrich, 99+%) was dosed at surface temperatures <130 K. Cyclohexene was purified by successive freeze-pump-thaw cycles prior to use. A constant cyclohexene exposure of 2 L was used for all experiments as this exposure provided significant coverage without appreciable multilayer formation. After dosing, the crystal surface was placed ∼5 mm from the opening of the random flux shield of the MS. TPD experiments were then performed with a linear heating rate of 3 K/s, and up to 10 masses were monitored simultaneously.
3. Results
3.1. Adsorption of 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene
DFT calculations were used to examine the adsorption of the three linear alkenes, 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene on monometallic and bimetallic transition metal surfaces. The lowest energy configuration for butene
[11]
over Pt(1 1 1) and Pd(1 1 1) is the di-σ adsorption mode at low surface coverages. In the case of C5 and C6 species, the linear alkenes are potentially more complicated than the cyclic ones because of the large number of conformers and the surface configurations available to them
[46]
.
The binding of individual molecules was studied on a 3 × 3 slab, corresponding to a coverage of 1/9 ML. All three alkenes were initially placed in a di-σ configuration whereby each of the carbon atoms were bound to a different metal atom in the surface. For each of the alkenes, several binding conformations were examined. The starting structure was always a linear carbon chain growing away from the surface. Rotations were then made about the CH2 groups to verify the most stable conformation. The adsorbate and the top two surfaces of the adsorbate-slab system were then allowed to relax to the minimum energy configuration.

a show the resulting optimized structures for 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene, respectively, on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. The calculated adsorption energies for ethene, propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene on Pt(1 1 1) were found to be −1.07, −1.02, −1.01, −1.03 and −1.02 eV, respectively. These values along with adsorption energies for all of these alkenes over the different bimetallic surfaces examined herein are tabulated in
Table 1
. The adsorption energy for 1-butene on Pt(1 1 1) was calculated to be 1.01 eV (97 kJ/mol). This value is consistent with the results of Valcarcel et al.
[11]
. Their studies have shown that the binding energy of 1-butene increased as the coverage decreased, with a value for the 1/9 ML coverage of about 93 kJ/mol.

Fig. 3
b show the binding energy vs. d-band center relationship for 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene, respectively. The bonding of an alkene to a transition metal in this configuration is controlled by the balance between the attractive interactions that result from electron-donation and back-donation, and rehybridization, and Pauli repulsion interactions
[24]
. The attractive interactions tend to outweigh the Pauli repulsion effects. The extent of this repulsive interaction varies for 3d, 4d and 5d surfaces, due to different adsorbate-matrix decoupling element (
) for 3d, 4d and 5d surfaces
[36]
. This matrix element is assumed to stay constant for surface metals within the same row. Hence, similar to results for ethylene
[24]
, the correlations in
Fig. 1
,
Fig. 2
,
Fig. 3
b show that separate decreasing trends exist for binding energy as the d-band center moves away from the Fermi level for the 3d and 5d surfaces. Overall, the trends in the figures show that the binding energies of the linear alkenes on the subsurface bimetallics (Pt–Ni–Pt, Pt–Cu–Pt, Pt–Co–Pt, Pt–Fe–Pt) are uniformly lower than those on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. This is consistent with the results for hydrogen and ethylene binding reported previously
[24]
. The comparisons in
Fig. 1
,
Fig. 2
,
Fig. 3
b also reveal that the Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, Pt–Cu–Pt(1 1 1) and Cu–Pt–Pt(1 1 1), do not follow the same trend as other 3d/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. This is most likely due to the fact that the d-states of Cu are nearly completely filled, making Cu different from the other 3d transition metals, especially in the utilization of surface d-band center as a parameter to describe the electronic properties.
3.2. Adsorption of cyclohexene
DFT was used to study the adsorption of cyclohexene on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces. Cyclohexene preferentially adsorbs on the Pt(1 1 1) surface in a CC di-σ configuration
[13]
. Hwu et al. performed high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and near-edge X-ray adsorption fine structure (NEXAFS) to determine the orientation of cyclohexene and intermediates derived from it on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces
[47]
. Their conclusions were that cyclohexene is di-σ-bonded on Pt(1 1 1) and a thick Ni(1 1 1) film, but only weakly π-bonded on Pt–Ni–Pt(1 1 1)
[47]
. It has been known that when these cyclic compounds bind in the di-σ configuration, sp2–sp3 rehybridization occurs. In addition, there is a slight puckering of the ring
[48]
,
[49]
, which leads to different ring conformations. Henn et al. have shown that the two stable structures for adsorbed cyclohexene are the chair and the boat conformations
[50]
. Saeys et al. and Morin et al. have reported calculations for adsorption of cyclohexene on Pt(1 1 1)
[13]
,
[51]
. Their studies have shown that the di-σ boat structure is the preferred binding configuration on Pt(1 1 1). In the chair configuration, the two C–Pt bonds are not eclipsed and this leads to imperfect orbital overlap and hence a lower binding energy as compared to the boat structure.
In the present work, cyclohexene was calculated to be bonded in the CC di-σ boat configuration on all surfaces studied at a cyclohexene coverage of 1/9 ML. The binding energy of cyclohexene on Pt(1 1 1) was calculated to be −0.85 eV. This value is given along with the cyclohexene binding energies on the other bimetallic surfaces in
Table 1
. Binding energies were compared as a function of the surface d-band center of the substrates (
Fig. 4
). Similar to linear alkenes, it is clearly seen that the cyclohexene binding energy decreases as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level. Similar to linear alkenes, separate trends for the binding energy were observed for 3d and 5d surfaces.

In order to compare DFT calculations with experimental results,
Fig. 5
shows the TPD results after dosing cyclohexene on the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and Cu/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. The Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces are considered first. The evolution of benzene is clearly seen on each surface. The bimetallic surfaces evolve benzene at lower temperatures than Pt(1 1 1), which indicates either a weaker interaction of this product with these surfaces if the product is desorption-limited, or a lower energetic barrier for reaction in the case of reaction-limited desorption. In addition to the formation of benzene, a significant amount of decomposition takes place on the Ni–Pt–Pt(1 1 1) surface, as demonstrated by the large hydrogen peak. It was previously found that hydrogen atoms recombine and desorb from Ni–Pt–Pt(1 1 1) at 355 K. As there is hydrogen being evolved from the surface at higher temperatures (418 K) from cyclohexene reactions, but no further evolution of gas-phase dehydrogenated products, this is indicative of decomposition occurring on this surface. The self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene to produce cyclohexane is also detected on the Pt–Ni–Pt(1 1 1) surface. The extent of decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation can be quantified from TPD peak area ratios, based on the following net reactions occurring on these surfaces:
(1)
(2)
(3)
Since the activities on Pt–Ni–Pt(1 1 1) are known
[52]
, TPD peak area ratios can be used to determine the activities on other bimetallic surfaces. To calculate benzene activity, the following equation is used. In this case, the activity of the formation of benzene on Pt(1 1 1) is calculated, as
(4)
The activity for self-hydrogenation is determined in the same way, except using cyclohexane peak area ratios. Decomposition activity is calculated by using a hydrogen peak area ratio in combination with the benzene and cyclohexane activities.
(5)
It is important to note that the overlapping fragmentation patterns of cyclohexene and benzene have been accounted for in this analysis. Also, it is assumed that the density of surface sites of the ML bimetallic surfaces is similar to that of Pt(1 1 1). The activities for each bimetallic surface are listed in
Table 2
. Consistent with the strong binding energy of cyclohexene, there is a substantial pathway for decomposition on Ni–Pt–Pt(1 1 1). Thus, it is hypothesized that cyclohexene bonds strongly on this surface, and is most likely di-σ-bonded as on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. In contrast, the total activity on the Pt–Ni–Pt(1 1 1) surface is much lower than either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni–Pt–Pt(1 1 1), which can be attributed to the weaker binding of cyclohexene on this subsurface structure, as predicted by the DFT calculations.

The interaction of cyclohexene with Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces was also examined. Noting contributions in the m/e = 78 data from cyclohexene fragmentation,
Fig. 5
demonstrates that these surfaces are largely inactive for any cyclohexene reaction pathways with the exception of Pt–Cu–Pt(1 1 1), which produces a moderate amount of benzene. As summarized in
Table 2
, molecular desorption of cyclohexene dominates on these surfaces with a small activity for benzene formation and a moderate activity for decomposition on Pt–Cu–Pt(1 1 1). In comparison, the Cu–Pt–Pt(1 1 1) surface is less active than the Pt–Cu–Pt(1 1 1) surface, as indicated by the very low total activity. These observations are consistent with the DFT results for binding energy of cyclohexene on these three surfaces. It is generally accepted that the uncertainty in the DFT calculations of binding energies, such as those shown in
Fig. 4
b for the differences in the binding energies of cyclohexene on different surfaces, is within about 0.25 eV. With such uncertainty, the binding energies of cyclohexene follow the trend of Ni–Pt–Pt(1 1 1) ∼ Pt(1 1 1) > Pt–Ni–Pt(1 1 1) ∼ Pt–Cu–Pt(1 1 1) > Cu–Pt–Pt(1 1 1). Experimentally, the results summarized in
Table 2
typically have error bars of 10% based on multiple sets of TPD on the same surfaces. With these error bars the extent of cyclohexene reactions (last column in
Table 2
) follows the same general trend as the binding energy on the five surfaces.
3.3. Adsorption of benzene
The adsorption of benzene was studied on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces by DFT calculations. Benzene generally orients itself on the transition metal surface such that it donates the π-electrons and reduces its aromaticity. Benzene adsorption has been studied in the past on a variety of adsorption sites. Both horizontal and tilted binding configurations have been examined. Mittendorfer and Hafner found the bridge site to be the stable site on Ni(1 1 1)
[53]
. Work done by Saeys et al. has shown that there are two stable adsorption sites on Pt(1 1 1), the bridge(30) site and the hollow-hcp(0) site
[14]
.
We performed calculations for benzene adsorption on both the bridge(30) and the hollow(0) site.
Fig. 6
a and b shows the bridge(30) and hollow(0) binding configurations, respectively, for benzene on Pt(1 1 1). The calculated values for benzene adsorption on the bridge and hollow site configuration were 0.70 and 0.40 eV, respectively. The binding energies for benzene in both configurations over all of bimetallic surfaces studied herein are summarized in
Table 1
. The results for binding energy vs. the surface d-band center are depicted in
Fig. 6
c. As seen for the other molecules, it is apparent that the binding becomes weaker as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level. It is also quite clear that the bridge site is the preferred binding site. This preference can be explained by the number of di-σ and π-type interactions in both the configurations. The bridge(30) configuration has four di-σ type interactions and two π-type interactions, while the hollow(0) site has three of each. The di-σ bond strength is greater than the π-bond strength and hence the bridge site is preferred over the hollow site.

It is also apparent from
Fig. 6
c that the binding on all the subsurface Pt–3d–Pt(1 1 1) structures is very weak as compared to Pt(1 1 1). This can be attributed to the interaction of the π-electrons in the benzene ring with the metal surface. As the benzene molecule adsorbs on the surface, there is a slight distortion of the molecule. The C–C bond distance in benzene increases because of the interaction with the metal surface.
Table 3
summarizes the C–C bond distances for the di-σ and π-bonds in the bridge and the hollow configurations on the Pt(1 1 1) surface and on the subsurface bimetallics. The C–C bond distance in gas-phase benzene is 1.39 Å. It is apparent from the table that for both bonding configurations, there is a substantial distortion of di-σ C–C bond when adsorbed on Pt(1 1 1). This is due to the filling of the antibonding π-orbitals. The distortion, however, is much less on the Pt–3d-Pt bimetallics. It is also seen that the C–C bond distances for the di-σ and π bonds are nearly the same on the bimetallics, indicating that the benzene molecule interaction with the surface is primarily a weaker π-type interaction, whereas on Pt(1 1 1) the interaction is mainly a di-σ type interaction. The C–C di-σ bond distortion on Pt(1 1 1) is greater for the bridge site as compared to the hollow site, consistent with the stronger binding strength for the bridge configuration.

4. Discussions
4.1. Effect of hydrocarbon chain length
Some studies have indicated that the chemisorption strength of linear alkenes is dependent on the chain length of the alkene. Chain length can also affect the surface reactivity of these alkenes
[9]
. Hence, it is important to study the adsorption trends with respect to chain length. Teplyakov et al. conducted NEXAFS and TPD studies to establish the relationship between the adsorbate structure and the binding energy in a ML of hydrocarbons on a Cu(1 0 0) surface
[28]
. Their work suggested an increase in the binding strength by 1.5 kcal/mol upon addition of each methylene group. Lin et al. have shown that the desorption temperature of alkyl chlorides from Cu(1 0 0) increases by 21 K upon addition of each methylene group
[54]
. Delbecq and Sautet have studied these trends theoretically for adsorption of ethylene, propene and 1-butene on Pt(1 1 1) and Pd(1 1 1)
[27]
. Their results indicated that the presence of larger alkyl substituents appended to the CC bond gradually destabilizes the adsorption of the alkenes on Pt(1 1 1) and to a much smaller extent on Pd(1 1 1).
Fig. 7
shows the calculated binding energy for linear alkenes on Pt(1 1 1) as the number of CH2 substituents increases. It suggests that the binding energy decreases as one goes from ethylene to propene, but then remains similar from propene to 1-hexene. When these linear alkenes are adsorbed on the surface, there are two types of interactions present, two-electron and four-electron interactions
[27]
. The two-electron interaction stabilize adsorption through electron-donation from highest occupied molecular orbital of the adsorbate into the metal and the back-donation of electron density from the metal into lowest unoccupied orbital on the molecule. The methyl substituents are electron-donating in nature and hence act to shift the π orbitals of ethylene up in energy. As a result of this upward shift, there tends to be greater overlap between alkene and the empty states of the metal surface thus resulting in an increase in the electron-donation from the alkene to the metal
[27]
. However the π∗ orbital also moves up in energy and this leads to a decrease in the electron back-donation from the metal surface. Overall, the net result of this two-electron interaction is an increase in the stabilization of the adsorbed molecule.

Fig. 7. DFT calculated linear alkene binding energies vs. the number of carbon atoms present for the Pt(1 1 1) surface.
Along with this stabilizing two-electron interaction, there is also the four-electron destabilizing interaction
[27]
. This results from the repulsive interactions between the two methyl-centered molecular orbitals (πCH3) and the occupied d-orbitals of the surface Pt atoms. Hence, the overall binding energy change depends on the balance between the attractive and the repulsive interactions. On adding electron-donating substituents (C3–C6) to the ethylene molecule, the repulsive interactions further dominate, leading to a decrease in the binding energy. There are also weak van der Waals forces of attraction present due to the interaction between the long hydrocarbon chain and the metal surface, but DFT cannot capture those forces. As a result the binding energy for propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene is lower compared to ethylene. Furthermore, the repulsive forces induced due to the electron-donating groups do not change significantly from C3 to C6. The overall effect is that the binding energy on Pt(1 1 1) decreases from ethylene to propene but does not change significantly from C3 to C6 alkenes, as depicted in
Fig. 7
.
Fig. 8
shows the binding energies of 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene vs the binding energy of ethylene on the Pt/Ni surfaces. The trend for alkene binding on the bimetallic surfaces (Pt–Ni–Pt and Ni–Pt–Pt) and the Ni(1 1 1) surface is generally consistent with the trend observed for Pt(1 1 1). The binding energies for 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene are similar and lower compared to ethylene. Experiments were performed previously to study the effect of chain length on the low-temperature hydrogenation activity on Pt–Ni–Pt(1 1 1),
[9]
. which revealed that the desorption for 1-butene occurred at a lower temperature (∼206 K) than that of 1-hexene (∼247 K). This is likely due to the weak attractive van der Waals forces present between the long 1-hexene chain and the metal surface, which DFT is unable to account for.

4.2. Effect of cyclic structure
The effect of cyclic structure was studied by comparing the binding of two C6 molecules, 1-hexene and cyclohexene on monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. Studies of the binding of these molecules are of interest for understanding their reactivity in reactions like reforming, hydrogenation and oxidation. Murillo et al. investigated the reaction pathways of 1-hexene and cyclohexene on the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces using TPD
[9]
. Yang et al. have probed the structures and reactions of linear and cyclic C6 hydrocarbons adsorbed on the Pt(1 1 1) crystal surface by sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy
[46]
.
Fig. 9
shows the binding energy comparison between 1-hexene and cyclohexene on the Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. It is clearly seen that cyclohexene binds more weakly than 1-hexene on all the surfaces. The weaker bonding of cyclohexene, as compared to 1-hexene, can again be attributed to the electron-donating character of the two molecules. Cyclohexene is more electron-donating as compared to 1-hexene, leading to a stronger repulsive forces for cyclohexene on metal surface. In addition, the cyclic molecule is more strained than the linear C6 alkene. Murillo et al. have studied the hydrogenation of cyclohexene and 1-hexene on the Pt–Ni–Pt(1 1 1) surface
[9]
. Their results indicate that cyclohexene desorbs at a lower temperature (∼227 K) than 1-hexene (∼247 K), which is consistent with the current DFT calculations.

5. Conclusions
Periodic DFT calculations were used to investigate the adsorption of linear and cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons (1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, cyclohexene, benzene) on 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces. The results are compared to understand the effects of cyclization and hydrocarbon chain length on the binding of these molecules on the bimetallic surfaces. Based on the results and discussions provided above, we can conclude the following:
(1)
All the linear alkenes considered (1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene) bind in a di-σ configuration to the bimetallic surfaces. The binding energies for these linear alkenes decreases as the surface d-band center moves away from the Femi level, although separate trends are observed for 3 d and 5d surfaces. The binding energies on the subsurface Pt–3d-Pt(1 1 1) structures are lower than on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, whereas the binding is stronger on the 3d-Pt–Pt(1 1 1) surface structures.
(2)
A combination of theory and experiments has been used to study the adsorption and reactivity of cyclohexene on several Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. DFT results predict that cyclohexene binds in the boat di-σ configuration on both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. TPD experiments for cyclohexene on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces show that the overall activity for cyclohexene on the Pt–Ni–Pt(1 1 1) surface is lower than on Pt(1 1 1) and Ni–Pt–Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. Experiments also show that the Pt–Cu–Pt(1 1 1) and Cu–Pt–Pt(1 1 1) surfaces are both less active than Pt(1 1 1), consistent with the DFT calculations.
(3)
The adsorption of benzene has been studied for both bridge(30) and hollow(0) sites. The binding energy on the bridge(30) site is higher than the hollow(0) site. The binding of benzene on the subsurface Pt–3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than that of either 1-hexene and cyclohexene.
(4)
The effect of hydrocarbon chain length has been studied by comparing the adsorption of the linear alkenes on the metal surfaces. The binding of 1-hexene and cyclohexene was compared in order to study the effect of cyclic structure and the results showed that the binding energy is lower for the cyclic structure on almost all the bimetallic surfaces.
