ABSTRACT
CO
adsorption on
Ce
−
Pt
(
111
)
has been studied by temperature programmed desorption (TPD), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Thin layers (1 to 3 ML) of Ce on
Pt
(
111
)
form upon annealing to
1000
K
a surface alloy which most likely is Pt terminated. The
CO
overlayer structure on
Ce
−
Pt
(
111
)
at saturation coverage is argued to be an intermediate between
(
2
×
2
)
and
c
(
4
×
2
)
superstructures. This intermediate structure exhibits a
c
(
4
×
2
)
LEED pattern in which some of the spots appear together as ordered triangles. The thermal desorption spectra for the
Ce
−
Pt
(
111
)
surface alloy are shifted down by a temperature of about
120
K
compared to the
CO
desorption of pure
Pt
(
111
)
, most likely due to a change in the
d
-band due to hybridization between Ce and Pt states, which results in a weakening of the resonant interaction between
CO
5
σ
and Pt
5
d
states.
