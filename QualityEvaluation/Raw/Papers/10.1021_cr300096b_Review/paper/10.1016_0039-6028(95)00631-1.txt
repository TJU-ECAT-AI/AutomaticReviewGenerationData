Abstract 
After depositing a single atomic layer of cobalt on the Pt(lll) surface, annealing at 600 K leads to the formation of a 
surface alloy of stable composition and structure. This phase was examined by crystallographic low energy electron 
diffraction finding that of the two topmost layers the first layer contains 20 at% of cobalt and the second one 80 at% of 
cobalt. No significant amounts of cobalt could be detected below the second atomic layer from the surface.

1. Introduction 
The cobalt/platinum interface has been object of 
a number of studies in view of the magnetic proper- 
ties of cobalt thin films and layered phases [1-3]. 
The structure of systems formed depositing ultra-thin 
films of cobalt on platinum has been studied by 
various techniques [4-6] as well as the surface struc- 
ture of bulk Co-Pt alloys [7-10]. Interdiffusion phe- 
nomena occur at the Pt-Co interface at relatively 
low temperatures with the formation of surface al- 
loys [11]. When starting from a single layer of cobalt 
deposited on Pt(lll) we observed by X-ray photo-

electron diffraction (XPD) [12] that diffusion of 
cobalt into the platinum bulk is limited to the two 
topmost surface layers only. Measurements by low 
energy ion scattering (LEIS) [11,12] showed that the 
topmost layer in this phase is composed principally 
of platinum. However, a direct measurement of the 
layer-by-layer composition was not possible by these 
techniques, and the LEIS results for the topmost 
layer needed to be quantified and verified by an 
independent technique. Hence, in the present study 
we used quantitative low energy electron diffraction 
for this purpose. LEED analysis has been shown to 
be able to determine the composition of the first few 
atomic layers of several alloys [13], including Co-Pt 
ones [7,8]. The results of the present work confirm 
that the surface alloy at the Co/Pt(lll) interface is 
two atomic layers thick. The composition was found 
to be 20 at% cobalt in the topmost layer and 80 at% 
in the second.

2. Methods 
2.1. Experimental 
All experiments were performed in a UHV cham- 
ber at a base pressure of 2 x 10 -8 Pa. The chamber 
was equipped with a three-grid LEED optics used 
also in retarding field mode for Auger electron spec- 
troscopy (AES). The Pt(lll) single crystal sample 
surface was cleaned and recrystallized in situ by 
cycles of Ar ÷ ion bombardment and annealing at 
1100 K, until no significant carbon contamination 
was detected by AES and a sharp LEED pattem was 
observed. Cobalt (99.997% purity) was deposited by 
means of an electron beam evaporator located in the 
LEED chamber. As reported in Ref. [11] cobalt 
grows at room temperature on Pt(lll) forming is- 
lands one atomic layer thick up to the completion of 
the first atomic layer. This mechanism was deter- 
mined in Ref. [11] by means of combined X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy and LEIS measurements 
that permitted a precise calibration of the coverage. 
The same techniques were not available in the appa- 
ratus used for the present study, hence the cobalt 
coverage was determined by a procedure that in- 
volved measurements of the secondary sample cur- 
rent as a function of the deposition time [14]. This 
procedure is described in detail in Ref. [4]. 
2.2. LEED crystallographic analysis 
The LEED intensity versus potential curves (I-V 
curves) was measured by means of a video LEED 
system at normal incidence (0 = 0 
°) and at 0 = 10 
° 
in the (121) direction. The condition of normal 
incidence of the primary electron beam was deter- 
mined from the comparison of the I-V curves of the 
symmetrically equivalent beams. The minor residual 
differences in equivalent I-V curves were compen- 
sated by averaging. In the calculations, the off-nor- 
mal incidence angle was also varied in steps of 
+ 0.5 
° around the value of 10 
° in order to determine 
a possible inaccuracy of the goniometer, but the best 
agreement for the optimized model was found for an 
angle of 10 
°. The intensities were normalized to 
constant incident current and corrected by subtrac- 
tion of the background. 
Theoretical LEED I-V curves were calculated by 
means of the standard dynamical theory [15] and also 
by an automated search method based on the tensor 
LEED approximation [16]. Tensor LEED is a pertur- 
bative method for testing several trial structures in an 
efficient and fast way. A full dynamical calculation 
is performed for a basic structural model to provide 
the reference amplitudes and their dependence on the 
atomic displacements within approximately + 0.2 ,~ 
from the reference structure. In both the standard and 
the tensor LEED method the diffraction matrices 
were calculated by matrix inversion, while layers 
were stacked by means of the renormalized forward 
scattering method. The atomic t-matrix approxima- 
tion (ATA) [7,8] was used in the analysis of the data 
for the surface alloy. In the ATA approximation the 
scattering amplitude from a species in a lattice site is 
described as an average of the scattering amplitude 
of the individual chemical species weighed by the 
respective concentration. 
Ten phase shifts were used to describe the scatter- 
ing of Pt and Co atoms. The set of phase shifts used 
here is the same used in previous LEED calculations 
for Co-Pt bulk alloys [8]. The Debye temperatures 
were taken as 315 and 302 K for Co and Pt atoms, 
respectively. The real part of the inner potential was 
considered as energy independent (10 V) and opti- 
mized in the search of the best agreement. The 
imaginary part of the inner potential was set to 5 eV. 
For the comparison of the calculated data with the 
experimental ones we used the Zanazzi-Jona (RZJ) 
[17] and Pendry [18] (RPE) reliability factors. The 
total energy range used in the analysis was 1240 eV. 
The error bars on the structural parameters were 
estimated from the variance of the Pendry R factor 
[18]. 
3. Results and discussion 
After room temperature deposition of amounts of 
cobalt of the order of one monolayer, the only 
change observed in the LEED pattern was an in- 
crease in the background and in the width of the 
diffracted spots of the substrate. The LEED struc- 
tural analysis of the (1 × 1) phase corresponding to a 
single atomic layer of cobalt has been reported in 
Ref. [4]. We found in this phase each cobalt atom

occupies a three-fold fee site. After annealing at 
about 600 K, interdiffusion takes place with the 
formation of a phase whose composition is stable 
and scarcely dependent on the exact conditions of 
treatment [11,12]. This is the phase that was exam- 
ined by crystallographic LEED in the present work. 
The LEED pattern observed after this treatment is 
still a (1 X 1) but the diffraction spots are sharper 
and the background is lower than for the “as de- 
posited” film. The unit mesh size was found to be 
the same as that of the platinum substrate. This 
measurement is scarcely sensitive to small changes 
in the mesh distance, however, since alloying takes 
place mainly within the first two layers [11,12], an 
in-plane contraction or expansion of the alloy phase 
would give rise to a mismatch with the substrate 
periodicity and hence to a coincidence pattern. Since 
no such pattern was detected, we can conclude that 
the surface phase forms a lattice with the same 
in-plane mesh as the substrate and where the strain at 
the interface is reduced by the formation of disloca- 
tions or other defects. Such a behavior was observed 
in the case of Pt-Ni alloys [19]. 
Taking into account the above results, the model 
considered in the calculations was that of a pseudo- 
morphic, random substitutional Pt-Co 
alloy with 
variable cobalt concentration. In an initial phase of 
the calculations we considered the presence of cobalt 
only in the first two atomic layers from the surface. 
In these two layers the cobalt atomic fraction was 
varied over the full possible range in steps of 5% 
using the ATA approximation. In an initial phase, 
the variation of the first three interplanar distances 
was considered. We observed that small variations in 
the third interplanar distance (da4) with respect to 
the value for pure platinum had no significant effect 
on the calculated curves, and hence in a subsequent 
refining phase this distance was kept fixed to the 
value corresponding to pure platinum. The optimized 
values of the structural and compositional parameters 
and the corresponding R 
factors for the normal and 
off-normal incidence data sets are reported in Table

calculations performed for values of d12, d23 and V

by the standard dynamical LEED theory for a relatively large grid 
of values (see text). These values were further refined by tensor 
LEED calculations; for this reason the minimum value of the R 
factor in the figure does not correspond to the value resulting from 
the overall optimization

normal are consistent within 10%. Over the total data 
set the values of the interp!anar distances were found 
to be da2 = 2.16 _ 0.05 A and d23 = 2.0 -q- 0.1 ,~. 
The firStointerplanar spacing coincides with the value 
of 2.16 A that can be obtained interpolating the bulk 
values for Pt25Co75 and Pt80Co20 [7,8] for an aver- 
age composition of "PtsoCos0". At the same time, 
the determined composition is consistent with the 
hypothesis that all the cobalt initially present (one 
atomic layer) remains within the two topmost layers. 
The R factors for the optimized model are accept- 
able according to the present standards, although 
somewhat higher than the values commonly obtained 
in dynamical LEED analysis. The residual discrep- 
ancy in the theory-to-experiment comparison may be 
attributed to imperfect ordering of the surface layers, 
quite conceivably caused by the slight lattice mis- 
match between the alloy layers and the pure Pt 
substrate. Such a composition-related lattice mis- 
match has been observed by STM to cause disloca- 
tions in the surface topmost layers in the Pt-Ni case 
[19] 
In order to refine the model in a subsequent stage 
of the analysis we performed LEED calculations 
introducing a variable concentration of Co in the 
third topmost layer, keeping the concentrations of the 
two topmost layers fixed. As expected, the sensitiv- 
ity of crystallographic LEED to this parameter was 
found to be low. However, we observed that the 
presence of cobalt in the third layer always led to a 
worse agreement with the experimental data for the 
whole range of concentrations tested. These calcula- 
tions cannot be considered as a proof that no cobalt 
is present in the third layer and below, since we 
estimate the sensitivity of LEED in the present anal- 
ysis to be no better than about 20 at% for layers 
beyond the 2nd. Nevertheless, this result is in agree- 
ment with the data reported in Re/. [12], where it 
was shown that it is possible to exploit effects due to

the onset of interdiffusion (~ 600 K) bulk diffusion 
in metals is an extremely slow process [13]. Hence, 
the formation of the "near sandwich" Pt-Co surface 
alloy must be explained taking into account kinetic 
factors, and in particular the fast diffusion of sub- 
strate atoms through gaps and defects of the deposit. 
This phenomenon has been observed, for instance, in 
the case of cobalt deposited on Cu(100) [22]. 
4. Conclusion 
The present study completely confirms the results 
of earlier studies [11,12]. In particular, the LEED 
analysis of the composition of the first layer agrees 
well with the results derived from LEIS [11] showing 
that the calibration procedure developed in that study 
was correct. Furthermore, the LEED data are in 
agreement with the XPD results in indicating that 
practically all deposited cobalt remains within the 
first two surface layers after thermal treatment at 
600 K.

atomic alignments in XPD to put an upper limit of 
less than 5 at% to the amount of cobalt present 
below the 2nd layer. 
In general, the enrichment in cobalt of the first 
layer and the "near sandwich" composition of the 
two topmost layers is compatible with the tendence 
of the (111) surface of several Pt alloys [7,8] of 
being enriched in platinum in the topmost layer. The 
enrichment in the second metal for the second outer- 
most layer has also been observed in the same alloys. 
A comparison of the results obtained for the 
Co/Pt(lll) annealed surface and those of two 
(lll)-oriented Pt alloys is shown in Fig. 3. The 
result for the surfaces of bulk alloys have been 
interpreted in the framework of the tight-binding 
Ising model (TBIM) theory [20,21] and it is possible 
that the same factors that cause the oscillating com- 
position profile for bulk alloys are at play in the case 
of the Co/Pt(lll) system studied in the present 
work. However, in this case the surface phase formed 
cannot be considered to be in thermodynamical equi- 
librium, since at the temperatures where we observed
