Abstract 
In the present work we consider with a molecular orbital model the H 2 dissociation mechanism on a Pt layer grown on 
Ni(111), and comparatively, on the pure metal components. The metallic substrate was represented by a four layers cluster. 
In the bimetallic case, the overall adiabatic energy profile is less stable in comparison with Pt(111). All these results are in 
good agreement with experimental evidence and can be explained using electronic structure arguments.

1. Introduction 
The catalytic and chemisorptive properties of 
bimetallic systems can differ noticeably from those 
of pure metal components. Recently 50%Pt50%Ni 
alloys have shown an important decrease in the 
chemisorption strength for molecular H and hydro- 
carbons like benzene [1] in comparison with pure Pt 
or Ni. The activity and selectivity in certain hydro- 
genation reactions can also be altered [2]. Noticeably 
this alloy presents a singular structure characterized 
by a first and a second layers with 90% of Pt and 
90% of Ni, respectively. An interesting analogue of 
the quasi-pure Pt surface of PtNi alloys can be seen 
in Ni(111) covered with a Pt monolayer. The corre-

sponding results attained with low energy electron 
diffraction [3] and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
[4] indicate that this overlayer seems stressed and in 
epitaxy with the substrate. 
Our interest was to obtain the equilibrium state 
parameters and the electronic structure for mono- 
atomic and molecular hydrogen adsorption on the 
Pt(monolayer)/Ni(lll) system. A comparison with 
the monometallic H/Pt(111) and H/Ni(111) cases 
was made. 
2. The model 
An extended Huckel molecular orbital method 
was used to determine minimum energies and equi- 
librium interatomic distances. The adopted para- 
metrization was the same than in a previous work for

small Pt aggregates on Ni(ll 1) [5]. The adsorption 
energy Ead was calculated as 
Ead = AE e + ~_,E 
r + UAQ, 
where A E e is the total valence electron energy taken 
as a difference with respect to the adatom (or 
adatoms) at infinity, EE r is the sum of the repulsive 
interaction energies between screened cores of H and 
substrate atoms [6] and 
UAQ 
is a 
repulsive 
electron-electron Coulombic energy due to the ex- 
cessive negative charge accumulated on the H atom 
[7]. In this work, we used U = 1 eV per transferred 
electron, which gives UAQ values representing less 
than 10% of the total energy. The ionisation poten- 
rials (IP) of Ni3d and Pt5d levels were adjusted to 
reduce the charge transfer (12.6 and 12.7 eV respec- 
tively). 
A cluster of 62 atoms (4 layers) was used to 
represent the metallic substrate, where Pt is in epi- 
taxy with the Ni(111) surface (see Fig. 1). A similar 
cluster was already used in a previous work to 
describe the Pt adsorption on Ni(111) [8]. The four 
possible sites of monoatomic adsorption and a H(1 
× 1) monolayer have been considered in our calcula- 
tions. In the case of H z molecular adsorption, the 
molecule was supposed to arrive along a trajectory 
normally to a top site, with its internuclear axis 
parallel to the surface. The H 2 molecule landed onto 
the surface so that the H atoms adsorb on two 
contiguous 3-fold sites. At each step along its way to 
the Pt surface, the H-H distance was optimized to 
give the lowest total energy. For comparative pur- 
poses the atomic and molecular adsorption of hydro- 
gen on Ni(111) and Pt(111) has also been studied. 
Moreover, this comparison was complemented by 
use of a hypothetical Pt substrate (hereafter named 
Pt') constituted by Pt atoms with the equilibrium 
parameter of Ni. The electronic structure was ana- 
lyzed in terms of the atomic local density of states 
(LDOS) [8] for H and substrate atoms.

3. Results and discussions 
In Table 1 are collected the Eaa values obtained 
for a H atom adsorbed on top (T), bridge (B), hollow 
octahedral (Ho) and hollow tetrahedral (Ht) sites of 
Ni(111), Pt(111), and Pt/Ni(111). The correspond- 
ing adsorbate-substrate interatomic distances dH_ M 
are collected in Table 2. Notice the increasing be- 
haviour of E~d and d H_ 
M on the coordination num- 
ber of the adsorption site in agreement with the 
experimental evidence for monoatornic H adsorption 
on late transition metals. In a previous theoretical 
work by Tantardini and Simonetta [9], it was found 
that the top and 3-fold sites have surprisingly about 
the same adsorption energy. Here, we could obtain a 
correct description of the adsorption site preference

by using the above-commented IP shifts. The calcu- 
lated Ead difference between H(1 × 1)/Ni(lll) and 
H(1 × 1)/Pt(lll) (~ 0.3 eV) is consistent with the 
experimental observation (~ 0.2 eV). Furthermore 
the corresponding calculated dH_ M values are shorter 
by about less than 0.2 ,~ in comparison to the 
experimental reported data [10]. 
Our computations for Pt/Ni(111) show an impor- 
tant decrease of Ead, in comparison with the atomic 
adsorption on the pure metals. This is particularly 
true for the high coordination sites Ho and Ht (about 
0.3-0.4 eV with respect to Pt(111)). The correspond- 
ing dH_ M distances are slightly smaller. Note that 
for the T adsorption site the changes with respect to 
Pt(111) are negligible. Calculations for the H(1 × 1) 
monolayer were also performed. They show the same 
trend as for the monoatomic case (see Tables 1 and 
2). These results are in agreement with the general 
experimental evidence (see above) and also with 
other theoretical results obtained from parallel calcu- 
lations done with a tight-binding recursive method 
[11]. 
The relevant characteristics of the electronic struc- 
ture for hydrogen adsorbed on late transition metals 
are exemplified in Fig. 2 where we show the LDOS 
for the H atom (full line) and for the first nearest- 
neighbour (dashed line) of the metallic cluster. The 
adsorption takes place on a Ho site. Note the pres- 
ence of a split-off hydrogen-derived level below the 
d-band at - 16 eV for both Pt and Pt/Ni. Similar 
results were obtained for H adsorption on Ni(ll 1). 
The broader d-band and the lower LDOS (E F) value 
for the Pt oveflayer in comparison with the pure Pt 
surface can be outlined. This result has also been 
obtained employing tight-binding calculations and 
has been observed in other overlayer structures such 
as Pd/W, where an apparent transfer of some states 
in LDOS decreases the Pd atom bonding ability [11]. 
We now comment the H 2 adsorption process. 
Some selected dissociation energy curves are pre- 
sented in Fig. 3, Figs. 4 and 5. They show the 
evolution of the adiabatic-energy profiles as the 
molecule approaches the surface. The transition be- 
tween the molecular and dissociated states is clearly 
evidenced by two different minima, situated at short 
(~ 1 ,~) and high (~ 3 A) H-H distances respec- 
tively. Note that no minima appears for H2-surface 
distances around 1.4 ,~ (for Pt and Pt/Ni) or 1.2 A 
(for Ni) showing that the H-H coupl 
e is in a non- 
bonding condition. In the case of the Pt overlayer 
(Fig. 5), the dissociation is noticeably unfavoured in 
contrast with the monometallic substrates. Finally, in

Fig. 6 the adsorption energy change of the system is 
plotted as a function of the H2-surface distance

different regions in the overall adiabatic-energy pro- 
o 
file. For H2-M distances higher than 2 A, it was 
possible to obtain a H-H distance corresponding to 
the lowest energy of the system (for a given H2-M 
distance). However this energy increases continu- 
ously as the molecule approach the Pt/Ni(111) sur- 
face showing that an adsorbed molecular state is 
unfavoured. For H 2-M distances between ~ 1.3 and 
2 .~ a relative maxima exists. In this region, there is 
no local minimum of energy as mentioned above. So

local gradient of the adiabatic energy surface. For 
smaller H2-M distances, the H atoms could find 
again equilibrium positions in the neighbourhood of 
two contiguous 3-fold sites and the molecule would 
be clearly dissociated. The only remaining interac- 
tion between the two H atoms is repulsive so that 
they are about 0.1-0.2 .~ outside from the adsorption 
site of the monoatomic case. However, in the special 
case of the Pt overlayer on Ni(111), this third region 
corresponds to binding energies higher than those for 
the first region. In other words, the H 2 molecule 
cannot be dissociated on this substrate in agreement 
with experimental finding [1]. One can also observe 
on Fig. 6 that the dissociation of H a over Pt(111) is 
activated at the difference of Ni(lll). This again, is 
in agreement with the experimental evidence [12]. 
In order to analyze more deeply the origin of the 
Pt/Ni(lll) behaviour, we considered the atomic 
adsorption of H on the Pt' substrate at the 3-fold Ho 
site. As can be seen on Tables 1 and 2, the E,a and 
dH_ M values are nearly identical for Pt' and Pt/Ni. 
This points out that the chemical properties of the Pt 
surface layer are largely dependent on the Pt-Pt 
overlap mediated by geometrical parameters. This 
conclusion is in agreement with the observation that 
the monoatomic adsorption energy and H-Pt dis- 
tance on the top site for Pt/Ni and Pt are very closed 
to each other. In this case, both the H-Pt overlap and 
H-Pt repulsion energy are almost insensitive to the 
overlayer structure. 
4. Conclusions 
In summary, we examined the atomic and molec- 
ular chemisorption of hydrogen on a Pt/Ni(lll) 
surface. In the case of the hydrogen atom, the vari- 
ous adsorption sites give almost similar adsorption 
energies, with decreasing absolute values with re- 
spect to Pt(111). Moreover the molecular chemisorp- 
don is inhibited. This behaviour has been related 
both to the electronic and geometric structures of the 
overlayer.
