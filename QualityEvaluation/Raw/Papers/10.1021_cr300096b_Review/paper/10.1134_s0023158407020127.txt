Abstract
The performance of a Co-Pt powder and of Co-Pt catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and on the graphite-like carbon material Sibunit in selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-containing mixtures is considered. Fine particles of metal-metal solid solutions and intermetallides were obtained by the decomposition of a Co- and Pt-containing double complex salt in a hydrogen atmosphere at ∼400°C. As compared to their Pt and Co monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and allow the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures to be reduced from 1 to 10−3 vol %. This effect is likely due to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface.
