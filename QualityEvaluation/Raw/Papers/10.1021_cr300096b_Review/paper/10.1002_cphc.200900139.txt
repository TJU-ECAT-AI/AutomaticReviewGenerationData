Correlating Benzene Hydrogenation Activity with Binding Energies of
Hydrogen and Benzene on Co-Based Bimetallic Catalysts
Shuliang Lu,[a] Carl A. Menning,[b] Yuexiang Zhu,*[a] and Jingguang G. Chen*[b]
The hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane is of significant
importance in the petroleum industry and for environmental
protection. The process of benzene hydrogenation has been
utilized commercially for the production of cyclohexane, which
is one of the key intermediates in the synthesis of Nylon-6 and
Nylon-66.[1] Thermodynamic and kinetic studies have shown
that polyaromatics are easier to be reduced than benzene
under moderate reaction conditions.[2] Thus, discovery of active
catalysts for benzene hydrogenation should be useful for the
removal and utilization of both benzene and polyaromatics.
Ni-based catalysts have been studied[3–7] in the hydrogenation
of benzene and are already used in commercial processes. Al-
though supported cobalt catalysts have been widely used in
Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, relatively few studies have been re-
ported concerning benzene hydrogenation over Co-based cat-
alysts.[8–13] In our previous work, PtCo and PtNi bimetallic and
the
corresponding
monometallic
catalysts
supported
on
g-Al2O3 were compared and the results suggested that Co-
based bimetallic catalysts possessed higher activity than Ni-
based catalysts for benzene hydrogenation at low tempera-
tures.[14]
Herein, we use Co-based catalysts to determine the effect of
bimetallic formation on the hydrogenation activity with com-
bined experimental and theoretical methods. The hydrogena-
tion of benzene is compared over silica-supported PtCo, PdCo,
RuCo bimetallic and the corresponding monometallic catalysts
using both flow and batch reactors. The hydrogenation activi-
ty, together with apparent activation barrier and rate con-
stants, were correlated with hydrogen and benzene binding
energies calculated from density functional (DFT) modeling, all
indicating that the benzene hydrogenation activity should
follow the trend of PtCo@PdCo>RuCo~Pt~Co~Ru~Pd. Be-
cause of the availability of the large database of binding ener-
gies from DFT calculations on bimetallic surfaces,[15] the correla-
tion of binding energies with benzene hydrogenation activity
should provide potential opportunities to predict and select bi-
metallic catalysts based on DFT calculations.
The catalyst preparation and evaluation methods for the hy-
drogenation of benzene in flow and batch reactors are similar
to those described in detail previously.[14] From the H2-tempera-
ture-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles for the catalysts,
shown in Figure S1, the presence of Pt, Pd and Ru promoted
the reduction of the cobalt catalysts at lower temperatures,
most likely due to the spill-over of atomic hydrogen from Pt,
Pd and Ru. In order to measure the number of active sites on
the surface for the reduced catalysts, the volumetric static CO
chemisorption technique is used and the results are listed in
Table 1. The amount of CO adsorbed per gram catalyst repre-
sents the number of active sites on the surface of the catalysts.
The catalytic activity of benzene hydrogenation over these
catalysts in a flow reactor is compared in Figure 1. The activity
is normalized using the conversion divided by the active sites
on the catalysts according to the amount of CO adsorbed from
CO chemisorption. The conversion of benzene without such
normalization is shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Informa-
tion. The catalytic activities for the seven catalysts show the
following trend: PtCo@PdCo>RuCo~Pt>Co~Ru~Pd.
The apparent activation barriers for benzene hydrogenation
are estimated by performing catalytic studies at different tem-
peratures, as shown in the Arrhenius plots for several catalysts
in Figure S3. The values are compared in Table 1. The PtCo bi-
metallic catalyst exhibits the lowest activation barrier of
21.2 kJmol1, with the apparent activation barriers following
the trend of PtCo !PdCo<RuCo~Pt<Co, which is generally
consistent with the trend in catalytic activity in Figure 1.
The batch reactor study shows the same trend in catalytic
activity for the hydrogenation of benzene. The different cata-
lytic activities are illustrated in the rate of benzene consump-
tion (Figure 2) and the production of cyclohexane (Figure S4).
The PtCo bimetallic catalyst exhibits much higher activity than
the other Co-based catalysts. The difference in rates is quanti-
fied by fitting a first-order rate equation to the consumption of
benzene. The value of the rate constant k is compared in
Table 1, which once again shows the same trend in hydrogena-
tion activity among the three bimetallic catalysts: PtCo>
PdCo>RuCo.
In our previous studies of the hydrogenation of cyclohexene,
the hydrogenation activity has been correlated with the bind-
ing energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on several
Pt-based bimetallic systems.[17] In order to determine whether
such correlation exists for the hydrogenation of benzene, DFT
was used to calculate the hydrogen and benzene binding en-
ergies on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces using Vienna
ab initio simulations package (VASP). The optimized configura-

tions for atomic hydrogen and benzene are shown in Figure S5
and Figure 3, respectively. A 22 slab was used for atomic hy-
drogen (2 hydrogen atoms per unit cell) and a 33 slab for
benzene (1 benzene per unit cell). Both types of slabs were 4
metal layers thick, which is the slab thickness typically used for
modeling a wide range of bimetallic surfaces.[15] The top two
layers were allowed to relax to the lowest energy configura-
tion. A 331 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh was used and
calculations were performed with spin polarization. For the bi-
metallic slabs, both subsurface
and surface configurations are
considered.
As
shown
in
Figure 3, for the surface CoM
M configuration, the top layer of
a slab was replaced with Co. For
the subsurface MCoM config-
uration, the second layer was re-
placed with Co. A bulk lattice
constant of 3.99, 4.01, 2.75, and
2.50  was used for the Pd, Pt,
Ru, and Co single crystals, re-
spectively. The respective closed-packed plane was used for
each host metal, where (111) was used for Pt and Pd and
(0001) was used for Ru and Co.
Results from DFT calculations have provided important in-
sights into the electronic density of states, chemical reactivity,
and structural stability, of many monolayer bimetallic surfa-
ces.[15,16] For example, it has been demonstrated that PtCo
PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111)
subsurface
bimetallic
structure[17,18]
showed
much
higher activity for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the
corresponding monometallic surfaces. The novel low-tempera-
ture hydrogenation pathway on PtCoPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) was correlated
to the modification of the electronic properties due to the for-
mation of bimetallic bonds between subsurface Co and the
surface Pt atoms.[17] Such electronic modification led to a de-
crease in the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclo-
hexene, responsible for the facile hydrogenation of cyclohex-
ene on PtCoPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111).
Similar correlation between hydrogenation activity and bind-
ing energy is made in the current study. As shown in the bold
letters in Table 2, the thermodynamically preferred bimetallic
structures, defined as the configuration with the lowest total
energy for a given adsorbate/bimetallic system,[19] are the sub-
surface PtCoPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and PdCoPdACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and surface Co
RuRuACHTUNGTRENUNG(0001) structures. The binding energy of atomic hydro-
gen on these surfaces follows the trend of PtCo<PdCo<
RuCo. A similar trend is also observed for the binding energy
of benzene on these surfaces, although the values, in particular
on the subsurface structures, are unrealistically low due to the
inadequacy of DFT to capture the van der Waals interaction
between benzene and metal surfaces.[15] Nevertheless, the
trends in the binding energies in Table 2 are consistent with
Table 1. CO chemisorption results, conversion of benzene in flow reactor, apparent activation barrier (Ea), and
reaction rate constant (k).

previous studies that surfaces with weaker binding energies of
atomic hydrogen and alkenes generally show higher hydroge-
nation activity.[15]
Overall, the results herein demonstrate excellent agreement
in the trends in hydrogen and benzene binding energy from
DFT calculations, catalytic activity and apparent activation
energy from flow reactor studies, and rate constant from batch
reactor studies. The PtCo and PdCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit-
ed higher activity than the Co monometallic catalyst, support-
ing the argument from previous studies that bimetallic cata-
lysts often demonstrate catalytic advantages over the corre-
sponding monometallic catalysts.[14–25]
In conclusion, the catalytic activity for benzene hydrogena-
tion of Co-based bimetallic catalysts was successfully correlat-
ed with the hydrogen and benzene binding energies from DFT
calculations. The PtCo bimetallic system, possessing the lowest
hydrogen binding energy in the subsurface PtCoPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) bi-
metallic structure, showed the highest activity for benzene hy-
drogenation, which was also in agreement with the trends in
the apparent activation barrier and the rate constant for ben-
zene consumption estimated using first-order kinetics. The
comparison between the experimental results and DFT calcula-
tions also suggests that bimetallic surfaces with lower binding
energies of atomic hydrogen and benzene should enhance the
rate of benzene hydrogenation. Such correlation suggests the
possibility of predicting desirable bimetallic combinations and
structures for benzene hydrogenation using the existing data-
base of hydrogen binding energy. More studies are needed to
determine whether there is a volcano-type relationship be-
tween hydrogenation activity and binding energy, as previous-
ly observed for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene.[17]
Experimental Section
The flow reactor studies were carried out in a quartz glass reactor
under atmospheric pressure at 343 K. The flow of benzene, control-
led by a micro-syringe pump with a flow rate of 5.6 mmolhour1,
was carried by H2 with a gas flow rate of 10 mLmin1 and N2 with
a gas flow rate of 40 mLmin1.[14] The batch reactor studies were
performed using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
to monitor the concentrations of individual reactants and products
during the hydrogenation of benzene.[14] More details can be
found in the Supporting Information.
