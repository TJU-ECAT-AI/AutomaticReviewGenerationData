Abstract
In this paper, a method of Ionization Spectroscopy (IS) is proposed for the non-destructive layer-by-layer analysis of the elemental composition
of a solid surface. Using ionization energy loss spectra, a layer-by-layer concentration proﬁle of the Pt80Co20(1 1 1) alloy surface is obtained for
different annealing temperatures. For the disordered Pt80Co20(1 1 1) at room temperature, the ﬁrst atomic layer consists of pure Pt with damped
oscillations in the deeper layers. Heating the sample reduces the oscillations. However, at a temperature of 823 K, a sandwich-like structure of the
type Pt/Co/Pt was found in the ﬁrst three atomic layers. For the ordered state the ﬁrst atomic layer also consists of pure Pt with bulk concentration in
other layers. LEED analysis shows a p(2  2) superstructure for the surface of the ordered Pt80Co20(1 1 1) alloy. The segregation behavior in this
alloy is further studied by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations combined with the Constant Bond Energy (CBE) model. The results of the MC
simulations agree well with the experiments at the higher temperatures, both for the surface composition and the concentration depth proﬁle. At
lower temperatures, some discrepancies exist between the MC results and the measured concentration proﬁle.

1. Introduction
The structural and quantitative properties of alloy surfaces
have been the subject of numerous studies in view of
developing a better understanding of the alloys catalysis. In
particular, binary alloys and intermetallic compounds of
platinum have quite interesting physico-chemical properties
and these materials are widely used in nanotechnology and
catalysis [1,2].
A lot of work was devoted to the study of segregation in the
Pt–Co alloys [1–8]. Basically a competition is expected
between two mechanisms that have a signiﬁcant effect on the
segregation: lowering of the surface energy by segregation and
the tendency for chemical ordering in the bulk and also in the
surface region (with possibly, the formation of a reconstructed
surface). Pt–Co is known to have a strong chemical ordering
enthalpy, which is the origin of the ordered L12 and L10 phases
of Pt3Co and PtCo, respectively. Depending on the bulk
composition, temperature and surface orientation, the interplay
of these driving forced leads to different degrees of surface
enrichment [1–5]. Furthermore, in order to minimize the total
energy, Pt–Co alloys may also undergo a (2  1) missing-row
reconstruction which is the thermodynamically stable conﬁg-
uration of the clean Pt(1 1 0) surface [7].
In recent years several non-destructive methods have been
used for surface analysis. Surface segregation in metallic alloys
can be studied with Auger Electron Spectroscopy and X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy, but the possibilities for obtaining a
layer-by-layer composition depth proﬁle with these methods
are not well established [9]. Low Energy Ion Scattering is
extremely sensitive to the surface composition, but it cannot
give direct information on the composition in deeper atomic
layers. Furthermore, the study of alloys of components with
comparable atomic masses is difﬁcult. Low Energy Electron
Diffraction (LEED) is capable of accurately measuring the
composition of the three outermost layers of substitutionally

(dis)ordered bimetallic alloys of type Pt–Me, where Me is Fe,
Co, Ni, Cu [1–5], but even LEED does not allow to obtain a
layer-by-layer composition proﬁle for more than three layers.
Gerlach et al. [10–12] was the ﬁrst to apply Ionization
Spectroscopy (IS) for the analysis of V, Ni, Pd and Mo as
impurities on the surface of polycrystalline metals without
depth analysis. In ref. [13] IS was used to analyze the surface
composition of single crystal alloys of Co–Ni and Fe–Ni.
However, the methodic described for the reconstruction of the
layer-by-layer concentration proﬁle cannot be applied for
alloys with strongly differing atomic masses of the components
as it does not allow to account for the inﬂuence of matrix
effects.
The aim of the present work is to use Ionization Spectro-
scopy for the non-destructive study of the layer-by-layer
composition of the Pt80Co20(1 1 1) surface as a function of the
heating temperature. Next, the experimental results are
compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, combined with
the simple Constant Bond Energy (CBE) model.
Thepresent paperisorganized asfollows: Section 2 reportson
the experiment and the characterization of the Pt80Co20(1 1 1)
surface, Section 3 describes the physical basis of Ionization
Spectroscopy, the layer-by-layer reconstruction methods and the
IS analysis. Finally, Section 4 deals with the MC simulation set-
up, while in Section 5 the results are discussed.
2. Experiment and characterization
A single-crystal sample of the Pt80Co20(1 1 1) alloy was
investigated in an UHV chamber equipped with electron and
ion guns and with a four-grid LEED optics with an energy
resolution of 0.3% [14]. Pumping with a titanium magneto-
discharge pump and a titanium sublimation pump results in
partial pressures of residual gases not exceeding 108 Pa. In the
vacuum chamber, the sample is heated by a tungsten coil and
the temperature is measured with a Pt/Pt–10% Rh thermo-
couple attached to the surface. The sample surface was cleaned
by cycled argon ion bombardments at 600 eV and in situ
annealing at 900 K during 1 h, until S, C and O impurities were
no longer detectable and LEED intensities were reproducible.
Ionization spectroscopy was chosen for the non-destructive in-
depth analysis of the surface composition of Pt80Co20(1 1 1).
Fig. 1 shows an example of the ionization of core levels of
platinum (DEPt
O2;3 ¼ 54 eV) and cobalt (DECo
M2;3 ¼ 62 eV) [15]
versus energy of primary electrons, E0, for the surface of the
alloy at room temperature. The errors of the ionization line (IL)
measurements do not exceed 5–7%.
The Pt80Co20(1 1 1) single crystal was grown using the
Czochralski method. The composition, controlled by atomic
absorption spectroscopy and by X-ray emission, is very
uniform along the sample and equal to 80 at% Pt within 1%.
The lattice parameter in the g phase, extracted from X-ray
measurements, is in close agreement with the tabulated value
a = 3.855 A
˚ and interlayer distance 2.226 A
˚ [16].
According to the phase diagram [17] (Fig. 2), in the high
temperature range, the alloy has a g structure (disordered
solution), which also exists at room temperature for bulk Pt
contents larger than 80–85%. The transition temperature
between the g and g2 phases for Pt80Co20 is 620–680 8C [17].
The distinct diffraction spots from the clean (1 1 1) surface
form a regular hexagon, pointing at the (1  1) bulk-like
structure. In the ordered phase, Pt80Co20 is very similar to the
stoichiometric phase Pt3Co, the excess Pt concentration
being randomly distributed on the cobalt sublattice. In other
words, the bulk unit cell can be viewed as containing three
Pt atoms and one atom consisting on the average of 4/5
Co + 1/5 Pt.
3. Ionization Spectroscopy
3.1. Physical model
IS is based on the measurement of the energy spectra of
electrons, which have lost a particular portion of the energy
DEb for the excitation of electronic transitions, that are typical
for a given kind of atom b. The position of an IL in the spectrum
with respect to the primary electron energy E0 is determined by
the binding energy of electrons in the ground state and by the
distribution of the density of empty states, but it does not
depend on the value of E0, on the work function or on the value
of the surface charge. One important advantage of the IS
method over other methods of electronic spectroscopy is the
possibility to vary the probing depth by varying E0 [15].
The calculation of the contribution to the intensity of an IL
by the electrons having lost an amount of energy DEb at the
depth Z from the sample surface by the ionization of the core
states of the atoms b is simple when a traditional experimental
conﬁguration is used (an incident beam of the primary electrons
is directed perpendicularly to the sample surface (u0 = 0) and
the secondary electrons are registered at the angle u with respect
to the normal). In this case calculations within the framework of
a two-stage model allow us to obtain the following expression
for the intensity of an IL [15]:

An effective probing depth in IS amounts to 3Lb because
the secondary electrons created in the near-surface region of
this thickness contribute for 95% to the total intensity of an IL.
An increase of the effective probing depth upon increasing the
energy E0 also results in an increased contribution from the
deeper layers of the concentration proﬁle into the IL intensity.
This enables us to carry out a layer-by-layer reconstruction of
the concentration proﬁles of the elements using the energy
dependencies of the IL.
After integration of Eq. (1) with respect to depth and spatial
angle of the four-grid energy analyzer, an expression for the
total IL intensity has the following form:

where Qmin = 48 and Qmax = 708 are, respectively, the mini-

quasi-spherical four-grid energy analyzer.
As pointed out above, the offered method is essentially not
sensitive to the type of the energy analyzer used. Only the
values of Qmin and Qmax that correspond to the concrete
conditions of an experiment should be substituted in Eq. (3). In
the case of a binary A–B alloy, usually the ratio of intensities of

where E0j is the energy of primary electrons for which we have
measured the ratio of IL intensities RA(E0j). Assuming that all
interlayer distances in the near-surface region of a single-
crystal alloy are identical and equal to d, for summations in
Eqs. (6) and (9) the number of terms is selected that corresponds
to the selection of N monolayers parallel to a free surface, using
the relationship (N  1)d = 3Lmax (where Lmax ¼ ðLAðEmax

solved only when it is determined or overdetermined, i.e. if the
inequality M  N is true for this system.
In the following sections, methods are presented for building
the solution of Eq. (9) and for the numerical calculation of the
concentration proﬁles within the framework of the described
model.
3.2. Layer-by-layer reconstruction methods
A system of equations, describing the deviations of the
concentrations in a monolayer i (NA(i)) from their bulk value
NA, can be represented in matrix form by the expression

and an explicit form of the matrix elements Qji is evident from
the expression (9). However, the practical solution of the
Eq. (10) presents particular difﬁculties because the matrix
elements Qji correspond to close energy intervals that do not
differ sufﬁciently. As a result, the determinant of the matrix Q is
close to zero and the system (10) is ill-conditioned. As a
consequence, the errors in the matrix elements Qji and in the
˜
RA values can result in an incorrect solution.
To construct a stable approximation for the solution of
system (10), the condition gradients projection method, the

method,
the

of
conjugate gradient projected on the P+-space and also the
regularization method [20] were used in the present work. More
detailed information on techniques for solving ill-posed
problems can be found in [19–21]. The described regularization
algorithm for the reconstruction of the elemental concentration
proﬁles in a binary alloy on the basis of energy dependencies of
the ratio of IL intensities is implemented in Fortran.
3.3. Results of the layer-by-layer reconstruction
For the thermodynamic equilibrium state, ionization spectra
of both alloy components at different temperatures were
measured. Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the IL ratio of Co to
Pt for the Pt80Co20(1 1 1) alloy on E0, normalized to the IL of
the pure components, at various temperatures. The chosen
interval of primary electron energy corresponds to the region,
where the inﬂuence of diffraction effects on the intensity of

ionization lines is minimal. Such a normalization is necessary
to take into account possible matrix effects caused by the
difference in atomic radius of platinum and cobalt. The results
of the layer-by-layer reconstruction are shown in Fig. 4.
At the same time, these data show that different layers are not
reconstructed with the same accuracy. The arithmetical mean
error in the concentration determination for the ﬁrst layer is, as a
rule, less than for deeper layers. After all, with an exponential
attenuation of the intensity of the electron ﬂow with depth in the
sample, the ﬁrst layer gives the main contribution to the IL
intensity. The error level is maximum for the layers in which the
concentration strongly changes from layer to layer. The error
level is much less for the layers in which the concentration is
close to the bulk value. This is related to the choice of an initial
approximation to the solution, which requires only minor
corrections of the variables for these layers during the
calculations. These tendencies are well observable in Fig. 4.
At room temperature, the (1 1 1) surface of the Pt80Co20 alloy
is enriched to pure platinum, and shows an oscillating
concentration proﬁle up to the sixth atomic layer. Heating the
sample to 613 K leads to a depletion of Pt atoms in the second
layer (Cð2Þ
Pt ¼ 24%) and to an insigniﬁcant enrichment of Co
atoms in layers three to six in comparison with the proﬁle at room
temperature. Increasing the temperature further to 673 K is
accompanied by a negligible segregation of Co from the second
layer (Cð2Þ
Pt ¼ 31%) to the ﬁrst (Cð1Þ
Pt ¼ 97%), while deeper layers
remain practically unchanged. At 823 K, a sandwich-like
structure of the type Pt/Co/Pt was found in the ﬁrst three atomic
layers. As is obvious from Fig. 4, heating the sample causes a
smoothing of the oscillations in deeper layers towards the bulk
concentration of thealloy. However, theﬁrst layerstill consists of
pure Pt up to 873 K. Further increasing thetemperature gradually
results in completely smoothed oscillations.
According to the phase diagram [17], the system exhibits
order–disorder phase transitions with formation of the ordered
phases g1 and g2 (Fig. 1). Consequently, the sample was slowly
cooled during 10 h from 1123 K to room temperature. As a result
of this procedure, a chemically ordered alloy surface of the L12
type was obtained. LEED shows super-structural reﬂections in a
diffraction pattern at E0 = 112 eV (Fig. 5a). A very similar
diffraction pattern was observed in earlier work [22] for the
ordered alloyCu3Au(1 1 1) at E0 = 55 eV. Theresult of the layer-
by-layer reconstruction for the ordered state shows that the ﬁrst
atomic layer consists of pure platinum, and that the other atomic
layers have concentrations near the bulk value of the alloy

(Fig. 6). Probing the surface with primary electrons of 58 eV
(corresponding to a probing depth of two atomic monolayers
[18]),a p(2  2)structure(Fig.5b)wasfound.Theappearanceof
these additional super-structural reﬂections in a diffraction
pattern can be caused by two possible phenomena: chemical
ordering at the surface of the alloy and/or a reconstruction of the
surface. According to work [23] on Pt (1 0 0) and (1 1 0)
surfaces, a reconstruction of the surface with formation of new
superstructures takes place. For Pt(1 1 1) it was established, that
the surface does not reconstruct but repeats the atomic locations
of the (1 1 1) plane of the fcc bulk structure [24]. Consequently,
in
our
case,
the
LEED
superstructure
observed
on
Pt80Co20(1 1 1) is presumably caused only by ordering in the
surface region. In the process of ordering at Pt80Co20(1 1 1) the
lattice parameter will decrease in comparison to the disordered
state and then the enrichment of the ﬁrst layer in platinum will
favor the formation of the surface p(2  2) structure.
In order to obtain a model for the Pt80Co20(1 1 1) surface
structure, reference can be made to
the
stoichiometric
composition Pt3Co (Fig. 7). In ordered Pt3Co, every Co atom
in the bulk is surrounded by12 Pt atoms. In theoutermost(1 1 1)-
layer, which consists of pure platinum, two types of Pt atoms can
be distinguished: 25% of the Pt atoms have three Pt neighbors in
the second layer, while the second type Pt atoms have contact
with only two Pt atoms and one Co atom. Since the atomic radius
of Pt is some 11% larger than that of Co, the Pt atoms of the ﬁrst
type are buckled over an amount dz above the surface (compared
to the type 2 atoms), and, as a result, the reconstructed p(2  2)
structure is formed at the surface. In an earlier study [25], a
similar situation was observed for Pt80Fe20(1 1 1).
4. Monte Carlo simulations
As a complement to experimental results, model calcula-
tions can also provide deeper insight in segregation, ordering
and reconstruction processes at alloy surfaces. In particular,
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations combined with semi-empirical
energy models have already shown to predict well, within
experimental accuracy, surface composition, surface ordering
and surface reconstructions [26–29]. The simplest energy
model is the Constant Bond Energy model, which is equivalent
to the regular solution theory. More sophisticated models are
the Embedded Atom Method [30], the Modiﬁed Embedded
Atom Method [31] and the Bozollo–Ferrante–Smith model
[32]. In this paper, only the CBE is used to investigate the
segregation behavior to the (1 1 1) surface of the Pt80Co20
alloy.
The MC simulations are performed in the Canonical
Ensemble (constant V, T, NA and NB) (CE). To test the accuracy,
some results where checked against simulations in the Grand
Canonical Ensemble (constant V, T and Ntot) (GCE). In this
ensemble, however, one needs to know the exact value of the
difference in chemical potential between the two components
at the experimental conditions. This can only be determined
iteratively at each temperature, according to the scheme given
in ref. [33]. It turns out that there are no signiﬁcant differences
between the results in the two ensembles for a simulation slab
of 24  24  24 atoms. For bulk simulations, periodic
boundary conditions in three dimensions are imposed to
mimic a (quasi)inﬁnite block of material. For surface
simulations, six empty layers (vacuum) are added to the
simulation block, three on either side, in order to obtain a Pt–
Co ﬁlm with two free surfaces. After long equilibration times
(3  107 trial steps), ensemble averages are taken over the next
3  107 trial steps by sampling with an interval of 3  105
steps.

in which a is called the alloying parameter. The value of the
alloying parameter is chosen so as to correctly reproduce the
experimental value of the order–disorder transition temperature
of 1023 K for Pt3Co. This choice of a guarantees that at each
temperature, the actual state of order in the bulk of the
simulation slab closely resembles the experimental one.
The values of the CBE parameters for the Pt–Co system are
given in Table 1. Fig. 8 shows the long-range order (LRO) and
short-range order (SRO) for Pt3Co as a function of temperature,
calculated by MC/CBE simulations. The MC/CBE simulation
results for the surface composition are plotted as a function of
temperature in Fig. 9.
5. Discussion
First, the change in composition of the outermost atomic
layer upon segregation is considered. Next some attention is
paid to the variation of the composition in the subsurface
layers.
Traditionally, for surface segregation in alloys, four driving
forces can be distinguished: lowering of the surface energy,
lowering of total bond energy, (partial) release upon segrega-
tion of the elastic strain energy around solute atoms and, ﬁnally,
segregation driven by preferential chemisorption. Under the
experimental UHV conditions, the latter can be neglected. In
ordering alloys, the pronounced preference for the energetically
favorable A–B bonds and the ordered lattice necessitate a
speciﬁc interpretation of these driving forces.
The ﬁrst driving force strives at a lower surface energy of the
alloy by segregation of the component with the lower surface
energy, in this case Pt. The second effect tends to minimize the
total bond energy in the sample. In a strictly stoichiometric
compound, atoms end up on the wrong sublattice after
segregation. Therefore, surface segregation is often endother-
mic in such compounds and a substantial gain in surface energy
is needed in order to generate an appreciable surface
enrichment [34]. In off-stoichiometric ordered compounds
such as Pt80Co20, on the other hand, the ideal ordering in the
bulk is partially restored by exchanging excess Pt from the bulk
with Co from the surface layer. Even without a difference in
surface energy, lowering of the bond energy contributes
exothermically to the segregation enthalpy. Consequently, this
off-stoichiometric effect [35] once more forces Pt to the
surface. Finally, for (dilute) disordered solutions of A in B, the
(partial) release of the strain energy around the solute atoms in
the bulk, causes the solute atoms to segregate to the surface,
especially if they are larger than the atoms of the host matrix. In
exactly stoichiometric ordered compounds, this elastic strain
energy is negligible, as the lattice parameter of the compound
has adjusted to the ordered stacking. In off-stoichiometric
compounds, however, the excess atoms are subjected to some
degree of strain. Partial release of this strain upon segregation
again results in a tendency for Pt to segregate.
Experimental values of the surface energy for Pt and Co are
2475 and 2550 mJ/m2, respectively [36]. In view of this small
difference, lowering of the surface energy contributes only
slightly to the total segregation enthalpy. This tendency towards
Pt segregation is however enhanced by the second (and the
third) effect as there is an excess of Pt in Pt80Co20 with respect
to stoichiometric Pt75Co25: 20% of the Co lattice sites are
occupied by Pt atoms. The segregation of this excess Pt lowers

The MC/CBE simulation results for the surface composition
are plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 9. Both the
experiments and the MC simulations produce evidence for an
exothermic segregation behavior, which causes the surface
enrichment to become less at higher temperatures. At lower
temperatures, a surface composition of 100% Pt is observed in
the IS experiments and this is conﬁrmed by MC simulations.
Also at 673 and 973 K, the simulated surface composition is in
good agreement with the experimental observations. However,
the segregation enrichment as a function of temperature varies
more gradually in the MC simulations than in the experimental
results. As strain cannot straightforwardly be incorporated in
the CBE model, a more powerful energy model that explicitly
accounts for the inﬂuence of the interatomic distances on the
bond energies is necessary to yield a more reliable estimation of
the strain effect.
As far as the concentration in the subsurface layers is
concerned, Fig. 10 shows the results of the MC simulations.
Considerable differences between the simulations and the
experiments are observed for the second and third atomic
layers. At lower temperatures, kinetic restrictions can be
expected for the high melting components Pt and Co, thereby
causing
MC
simulations
(equilibrium)
and
experiments
(kinetically limited) to diverge. These kinetic considerations,
however, cannot account for all discrepancies.
In this context, it is interesting to compare the segregation
behavior to the (1 1 1) surface of three Pt80M20 (M = Fe, Co,
Ni) alloys. At moderate temperatures, the surface is driven
towards a pure Pt layer, due to the off-stoichiometry. For the
highly exothermic Pt80Fe20 alloy (Tc (Pt3Fe) = 1623 K), a
monotonous segregation proﬁle is reported in literature [25],
whereas the less exothermic Pt78Ni22 alloy shows a strongly
oscillating concentration depth proﬁle [37]. As the Pt80Co20
alloy has an intermediate Tc, it can be expected to also behave in
an intermediate manner. The MC/CBE simulations indeed
show a slightly oscillating depth proﬁle which is, however, in
contrast to the strong oscillations found in the experiments. The
discrepancy between MC/CBE simulations and the experi-
mental results must be ascribed to driving forces that are not
included in the CBE model. Beside strain energy, also
considerable magnetic interactions are present in the Pt80Co20
system. These magnetic interactions introduce a positive
energy of mixing which drives the system towards clustering of
the magnetic species [38]. By studying Pt75Co25 ﬁlms, Rooney
et al. [38] indeed observed a signiﬁcant increase of the Curie-
temperature by more than 200 K, which could only be the
consequence of signiﬁcant Co clustering, presumably driven by
magnetic energy.
