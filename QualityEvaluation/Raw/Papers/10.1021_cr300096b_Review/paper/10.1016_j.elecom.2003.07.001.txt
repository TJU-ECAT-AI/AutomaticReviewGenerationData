Abstract
The electrochemical behavior of palladium modiﬁed Pt(1 0 0) in perchloric acid solution has been studied by means of cyclic
voltammetry, CO bulk oxidation and in-situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. FTIR spectra on Pd submonolayers
reveal that at low potentials (about 0.4 V) Pd-bounded CO is oxidized preferentially, whereas at the same time the Pt–CO oxidation
rate is rather slow.

1. Introduction
In the last years thin transition metal ﬁlms supported
on Pt(hkl) and Au(hkl) have been studied in great detail
in order to establish a link between physical properties
of a surface and its electrocatalytic activity [1–13]. For
example the morphology and stability of Pd ﬁlms on
Pt(1 1 1) were examined by utilizing in-situ surface X-ray
scattering (SXS) [12,14] and FTIR [10,13] measure-
ments. SXS studies demonstrated that electrochemically
deposited ﬁlms are pseudomorphic, whereby the Pd at-
oms occupy commensurate Pt sites such as to continue
the ABC stacking of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate. These ﬁlms
are rather stable between the hydrogen evolution and
the oxide formation potential region, showing no sign of
hydrogen absorption characteristic for bulk Pd and also
observed for a 3D Pd island deposited on Pt(hkl) with
HPd > 1ML [14]. FTIR characterization of Pt(1 1 1)–
COad modiﬁed with Pd (0ML < HPd < 1ML) was used
as an indirect method to establish whether Pd forms 2D
islands or whether Pd atoms disperse on the surface
much more randomly, as seen for the deposition of Bi
on transition metals [15]. The appearance of separate
C–O stretching bands, corresponding to CO adsorbed
on Pt and Pd indicated that Pd atoms cluster into islands
and that Pt and Pd behave according to their own sur-
face chemistry.
Compared to PdxMLPt(1 1 1), much less information
is available for palladium ﬁlms supported on a Pt(1 0 0)
substrate and previous investigations were mainly fo-
cused on Pd multilayers [6,8,16,17]. Whereas Pd de-
position on Pt(1 1 1) follows the Stranski–Krastanov
growth mode, e.g., three-dimensional pseudomorphic
crystalline Pd islands begin to aggregate after one
smooth Pd monolayer is formed on the Pt substrate
[12], on Pt(1 0 0) three-dimensional Pd begins well be-
fore the ﬁrst Pd monolayer is completed [18]. In this
study Pd submonolayers deposited on Pt(1 0 0) are
investigated in perchloric acid solution by means of
cyclic voltammetry, CO oxidation with in a rotating
disk-electrode (RDE) conﬁguration in CO saturated
electrolyte (CO bulk oxidation), and in-situ FTIR
spectroscopy. The Pd coverage of the ﬁlms was kept
below 70% in order to avoid the formation of three-
dimensional islands. Therefore, the catalytic activity for
CO oxidation can be compared at the free Pt sites and
Pd islands of monoatomic height having the same
surface structure.

2. Experimental
2.1. Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical preparation of thin palladium
ﬁlms on Pt single crystals is well established and was
described previously [8,10,11,19]. In short, following
cleaning of the Pt(1 0 0) crystal by ﬂame annealing in
a hydrogen ﬂame and cooling in a mild stream of a
mixture of H2 + Ar the crystal was protected by a
drop of ultra pure water and transferred into the
electrochemical cell in the hanging meniscus conﬁgu-
ration. The electrode was immersed at a potential of
0.30 V and immediately subjected to a potential
cycling
between
0:05 < E < 0:7
V
in
a
0.05
M
H2SO4 + 5  106 M PdO solution with a sweep rate
of 50 mV/s. In contrast to palladium deposition
on Pt(1 1 1), on Pt(1 0 0) Pd grows in 3D islands,
as shown by surface X-ray scattering [18]. Determi-
nation of the Pd coverage is, therefore, not straight-
forward. A rough estimation (following the method
of Llorca et al. [8]) based on the charges of the
hydrogen desorption and sulfate adsorption peaks
assigned to Pt and Pd in the voltammograms in
sulfuric acid solution leads to values of about 40 and
60% Pd coverage after 5 and 10 min deposition time,
respectively.
After the electrochemical Pd deposition, the elec-
trode was rinsed with ultra pure water and transferred
either into the in-situ FTIR cell or to a thermostated
standard three compartment electrochemical cell in the
RDE conﬁguration. Both cells contained argon satu-
rated 0.1 M HClO4 solution. For the electrochemical
cell a circulating constant temperature bath (Fischer
Isotemp Circulator) maintained the temperature of the
electrolyte constant within 0.5 K. For recording the
polarization curves in CO saturated electrolyte (CO
bulk oxidation), the electrolyte was saturated with CO
for at least 5 min while holding the potential at 0.05
V. Then the electrode was rotated with 2500 rpm and
a polarization curve with a scan rate of 20 mV/s
recorded.
The acid solutions were prepared from concentrated
sulfuric acid (EM Science Suprapure) and concentrated
perchloric acid (Baker Ultrex), respectively, using tri-
ply pyrodistilled water. Prior to each experiment all
solutions were deaerated by purging with argon (Air
Products 5N5 purity). The reference electrode for the
electrochemical cells was a saturated calomel electrode
(SCE) separated from the working electrode compart-
ment by a closed electrolyte bridge in order to avoid
chloride contamination. All potentials shown in the
text, however, refer to the reversible hydrogen elec-
trode in the same solution, calibrated from the re-
versible potential for the hydrogen evolution/oxidation
reaction.
2.2. FTIR measurements
The in-situ FTIR measurements were recorded with a
Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrometer with a liquid nitrogen
cooled MCT detector. All IR measurements were per-
formed in a spectroelectrochemical glass cell designed
for an external reﬂection mode in a thin layer conﬁgu-
ration. The cell is coupled at its bottom with a CaF2
prism beveled at 60 from the surface normal. Prior to
each measurement, a cyclic voltammogram was re-
corded in order to check the cleanliness of the electrode
surface. Subsequently the solution was saturated with
CO (Spectra Gases N4.5) for at least 5 min holding the
electrode potential at 0.00 V before pressing the sample
onto the prism. The spectra were recorded with a reso-
lution of 8 cm1. All measurements were performed
using p-polarized light. In order to obtain a single beam
spectrum 100 scans were collected at each potential re-
sulting in a recording time of about 50 s. Absorbance
spectra were calculated as the ratio  logðR=R0Þ, where
R and R0 are the reﬂectance values corresponding to the
sample and reference spectra, respectively. Reference
spectra were recorded either at 1.0 V, where COad is
completely oxidized, or at 0.00 V before the onset of
COad oxidation. The reference potential in the spectro-
electrochemical cell was controlled by a reversible hy-
drogen electrode (RHE).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Cyclic voltammetry and CO bulk oxidation
In Fig. 1(a) the voltammogram of bare Pt(1 0 0) in
perchloric acid solution after ﬂame annealing and
cooling of the crystal in a H2/Ar mixture is depicted.
Based on in-situ SXS measurements, it was shown that
after such a preparation the unreconstructed Pt(1 0 0)-
(1  1) surface is obtained [20]. The characteristic broad
peak in the positive going scan at 0.4 V can be assigned
to the desorption of underpotential deposited hydrogen
Hupd, followed by the adsorption of oxygenated species,
e.g., OH. Compared to bare Pt(1 0 0) the voltammo-
grams of the PdxMLPt(1 0 0) (x ¼ 0:48 and 0.64), de-
picted in (Figs. 1(b) and (c)), show that the desorption of
Hupd is shifted to more negative potentials [8]. With
increasing Pd coverage a reversible peak at 0.2 V de-
velops, similar, but less pronounced, than in sulfuric
acid solution [8,16,17,21]. At the same time the ‘‘Pt
peak’’ at 0.4 V diminishes.
In order to probe the inﬂuence of Pd adatoms de-
posited (in the submonolayer coverage regime) on
Pt(1 0 0) on the electrooxidation of carbon monoxide
CO bulk oxidation experiments were performed for all
three surfaces. Analyzing the polarization curves shown
in Fig. 1 the inﬂuence of Pd is obvious. With an
810

increasing Pd surface coverage the potential where the
maximum current density (diﬀusion limited current
density) is obtained in the positive going scan shifts to
higher potentials (see dashed line as a guide for the eye).
This ﬁnding is consistent with CO stripping curves in
argon saturated electrolyte [17,21], which also show a
shift of the peak potential to higher values if Pd is de-
posited. These results clearly indicate for high potentials
slower kinetics of the oxidation reaction on Pd modiﬁed
Pt(1 0 0). Furthermore, it can be observed that in the
negative going sweep the oxidation current drops earlier
(at higher potentials) to zero on Pd modiﬁed than on
bare Pt(1 0 0) and therefore showing a lower hysteresis in
the polarization curves. A similar behavior of low cat-
alytic activity for Pd has been reported before for Pd
ﬁlms with Pt(1 1 1) as a substrate as well as for Pd(hkl)
single crystals [10,17,22,23]. The ﬁndings can be associ-
ated with the higher oxophilicity of Pd, e.g., the stronger
interaction of Pd with oxygenated species. We proposed
for the system PdxMLPt(1 1 1) that the inhibition of the
CO oxidation kinetics on Pd is due to a stronger Pd–OH
bond rather than a higher CO adsorption energy on Pd
compared to Pt [10].
Turning our attention to the so-called pre-ignition
potential region, the potential region in the polarization
curves before reaching the diﬀusion limited current
density [24], it is important to note that in this potential
region the CO oxidation currents are higher on Pd
modiﬁed Pt compared bare Pt(1 0 0). However, the ki-
netic analysis of the polarization curves of CO bulk
oxidation is not straight-forward, since the polarization
curves are very sensitive to the CO adsorption potential,
and hence, to the CO coverage obtained on the surface
[25]. Far more accurate, especially for determining the
onset potential of CO oxidation, is the use of FTIR
spectroscopy.
3.2. In-situ FTIR measurements
In Fig. 2 series of infrared spectra of the three sur-
faces in CO saturated perchloric acid solution are
shown. In the spectra of bare Pt(1 0 0) at potentials be-
low 0.6 V two absorption bands can be distinguished.
The bands are located at about 2055 and 1870 cm1 and
can be assigned to linear- and bridge-bonded CO, re-
spectively [16,26]. Starting at 0.0 V and stepping the
potential in positive direction (in steps of 0.1 V), the ﬁrst
sign of COad electrooxidation is based on the emerging
absorption band of CO2 dissolved in the solution (which
is located around 2343 cm1) and can be observed at a
potential of 0.3 V. This ﬁnding is at variance with the
CO bulk oxidation curves in Fig. 1, which show the
onset of CO oxidation around 0.55 V. Note, however,
that the conditions for the two measurements are dif-
ferent, the polarization curve being recorded with a scan
rate of 20 mV/s and showing therefore transient be-
havior, whereas the IR spectra are recorded for about 50
s at each potential, i.e., the latter being closer to steady
state conditions.
In comparison to the just described IR spectra of
Pt(1 0 0), the infrared spectra of Pt(1 0 0) modiﬁed by a
Pd submonolayer (Figs. 2(b) and (c)) exhibit an addi-
tional CO absorption band located at about 1920 cm1.
In agreement with previous studies of this system (Pd
multilayers were studied) [6,16] this band is assigned as
the C–O stretching mode of the molecule bridge-bonded
to Pd. The fact that independent CO bands for Pt–CO
and Pd–CO can be detected on the Pt(1 0 0) surface
covered with a Pd submonolayer ﬁlm indicates that Pd
forms islands on the surface, which SXS measurements
indicate being pseudomorphic [18]. Based on IR spectra,
therefore, it is reasonable to propose that there is no
strong coupling between CO adsorbed on Pt and on Pd
and that Pd and Pt atoms behave independent from each
other according to their own surface chemistry.
Conﬁrmation of the nature of CO interaction on the
PdxMLPt(1 0 0) surface has been obtained from moni-

oxidation (dashed curve, right tick label) for PdxMLPt(1 0 0) surfaces in

respectively. (a) x ¼ 0, (b) x  0:48, (c) x  0:64.

toring the potential-dependent change in intensity of the
absorption bands associated with CO bound to Pt and
Pd sites, respectively. Interestingly, and in contrast to
the PdxMLPt(1 1 1) [10,23] system, (Figs. 2(b) and (c))
unambiguously show that as the potential is stepped
more positive than 0.3 V the Pd–CO band disappears
before the Pt–CO band does. Note that this behavior
was observed independent of the nature of the sup-
porting electrolyte, i.e., in perchloric acid, sulfuric acid
and in alkaline solution (the latter two are not shown).
In order to investigate this phenomenon, which obvi-
ously contradicts a simultaneous CO oxidation on Pt
and Pd sites, a time-dependent series of spectra of the
incipient CO oxidation on Pd0:5MLPt(1 0 0) at a ﬁxed
potential of 0.4 V is shown in Fig. 3. Again the prefer-
ential disappearance of the Pd–CO band can be ob-
served, whereas the Pt–CO band seems to be almost
unaﬀected. A close inspection of the band position for
CO bonded atop on Pt, however, clearly shows that
once the potential is stepped from 0.0 to 0.4 V the band
position shifts from 2058 to 2047 cm1 within 5 min.
Such a red-shift indicates that the CO surface coverage
on the bare Pt sites slightly decreases, therefore reducing
the CO–CO repulsion on the surface [27].
In summary, on Pd modiﬁed Pt(1 0 0) surfaces start-
ing at a potential of about 0.3 V COad is oxidatively
removed from the surface (see CO2 bands in (Fig. 2),
presumably by the reaction with OHad through a
Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism [24], i.e.:
COad þ OHad ! CO2 þ Hþ þ e
ð1Þ
In the potential region of about 0.4 V, the FTIR
results unambiguously show that the reaction is more
favorable on the Pd sites than on (the modiﬁed) bare Pt

sites. It is important to emphasize that whereas Pd–CO
is oxidized almost completely after 5 min the CO cov-
erage on Pt changed very little. On the other hand at and
above the ignition potential unmodiﬁed Pt(1 0 0) is more
active than PdxMLPt(1 0 0). This is in accordance with
our previous proposition for PdxMLPt(1 1 1) [10] that the
high oxophilicity of Pd inhibits the reaction due to an
increased OH adsorption strength and consequently
Pd–OH is less reactive than Pt–OH. At low potentials,
however, it seems that the higher oxophilicity of Pd re-
sults in an increased adsorption rate of OH on the Pd
islands relative to the free Pt(1 0 0) sites and conse-
quently CO oxidation is more favorable on Pd than on
Pt. Finally, considering that even after 5 min the Pt–CO
band is clearly observed in the spectra it appears that in
contrast to a rather fast surface diﬀusion on bare Pt [28]
on the PdxMLPt(1 0 0) electrodes diﬀusion of CO from
bare Pt sites onto Pd islands does not take place. One
possible explanation for this unexpected behavior might
be a high energy barrier for surface diﬀusion across a
monoatomic step onto an island. For a complete un-
derstanding of the ﬁndings, however, further theoretical
and experimental investigations are necessary.
