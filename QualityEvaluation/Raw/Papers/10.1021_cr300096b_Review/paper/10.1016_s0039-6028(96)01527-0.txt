Abstract 
Synchrotron-radiation 
induced core-level photoemission 
spectroscopy 
(PES) has been used to characterise 
the growth of 
Pt/Cu( 100). Decomposition 
of the Pt 4f,,z photoemission 
lines shows, for Pt deposition up to 2 ML, the formation during the 
growth process of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy. We estimate the Pt concentration in the surface layer to be 50%. This result is 
consistent with the observed c(2 x 2) LEED pattern. For higher coverage, the surface alloy is destroyed and a pure and disordered 
Pt thin fihn starts to grow. Annealing of the surface alloy formed during the growth of the pure Pt thin film at 300°C leads to the 
same situation: formation of a surface alloy due to a kinetic blocking of the dissolution. The surface composition of this surface 
alloy is Cu,&,,. 
This particular behaviour of the kinetics of dissolution has been already observed in Pt/Cu( 111).

1. htroduction 
Alloy and bimetallic surfaces have become an 
area of much current research [l] because of their 
fundamental interests and also their importance in 
novel device fabrication for various technological 
applications, 
for examples in catalysis, coatings, 
and magnetic recording [2,3]. The deposition of 
metals on metals presents an alternative approach 
to studies of alloy surfaces and a way of producing 
controllable compositions more readily. Such sur- 
faces may also exhibit configurations 
and proper- 
ties which are not obtainable at alloy surfaces. 
As a part of a wider research project on thin 
fihns and surface alloys, we have studied the Pt-Cu

system. A strong tendency of surface-alloy forma- 
tion is expected for this particular 
coupling of 
transition metals, since the bulk mixing enthalpy 
is exothermic. A continuum of solid solutions and 
several ordered bulk alloy phases are known [4]. 
Moreover, 
the surface free energy of Pt exceeds 
that of Cu, which may favour Cu segregation [ 51. 
In energy terms we can express this as a balance 
between three driving forces: (i) the surface ener- 
gies, (ii) the size effect and (iii) the mixing 
enthalpy. This is the so-called “three effects” rule. 
This rule, first applied to studies of surface segre- 
gation phenomena in metallic alloys [6], has been 
extended 
to studies of surface-alloy 
formation 
during the dissolution of thin films [7,8]. 
From an experimental 
point of view, we have 
already demonstrated the possibility of forming an 
extended 
Pt-Cu 
surface alloy due to a kinetic 
blocking 
of 
the 
dissolution 
when 
annealing

Pt/Cu(lll) 
[9] and Cu/Pt(lll) 
[lo]. This leads, 
respectively, to Cu,Pt and Cu,,Pt,, 
surface alloys. 
In order to investigate the effect of the anisot- 
ropy of the relative surface free energy [ 
111 in the 
formation of such surface alloys, in this paper we 
present results obtained on the growth and surface- 
alloy formation for the Pt/Cu( 100) system. 
2. Experimental 
The experiments were carried out using synchro- 
tron radiation at the SuperAco storage ring, Orsay, 
France. 
The beamline used was SA73b with a 
TGM7” monochromator. 
The experiments 
were 
performed in a stainless-steel UHV chamber. The 
system was equipped with a hemispherical analyser 
for PES, a cylindrical mirror analyser (CMA) for 
AES, and LEED 
apparatus. 
The base pressure 
during analysis was 8 x lo-l1 Torr. Clean Cu( 100) 
single-crystal surfaces were obtained by repeated 
cycles 
of 
argon-ion 
sputtering 
(600 eV, 
8 ,uA cm-“) and annealing at 850 K. Pt evapora- 
tion was carried 
out at room 
temperature 
by 
resistively heating a pure Pt wire. The pressure 
during 
evaporation 
was typically 
4-10 x 10-l’ 
Torr, depending on the duration of the deposition. 
The Pt deposition rate was obtained in two ways: 
first by using a quartz balance monitor, and second 
by comparing 
the intensities of the Pt and Cu 
Auger 
transitions 
with 
previous 
results 
from 
Graham et al. [12]. 
To study the Pt 4f,,, photoemission 
line (bulk 
binding energy (BE) 7 1.15 eV), the photon energy 
was set to 
150 eV using p-polarisation. 
This 
allowed us to optimise the Pt 4f cross-section and 
the monochromator 
response, and to minimise the 
photoelectron 
mean free path, making our spectra 
more surface-sensitive. 
The overall energy reso- 
lution was 300 meV. 
3. Results 
3.1. Data analysis 
In Fig. la we show a typical Pt 4f,,, core-level 
spectrum. All the spectra were treated the same 
way: the binding-energy scale was set according to 
the Fermi-level 
position 
measured 
after 
each 
spectrum. To eliminate the effect of variation of 
the photon flux, all spectra were normalised with 
respect to the background 
intensity at a constant 
kinetic energy (KE) in the low-BE side. To distin- 
guish and localise the different contributions 
of 
the Pt 4f,,, peak, we performed CO adsorption on 
the surface for several characteristic Pt coverages. 
The effect of CO exposure, as described elsewhere 
[9,13], is to shift the Pt 4f,,, surface peak by 1.2 eV 
towards higher BE. It is possible to determine the 
position of surface and bulk peaks from the differ- 
ence spectrum. This is illustrated in Fig. lb. 
Using the data results after CO exposure, the 
spectra were fitted using a Doniach-Sunjic 
line- 
shape [14]. A stepped, continuous 
background 
was subtracted 
during the fit. Fig. la shows an 
example of a fit for a 6 ML Pt deposition, taken 
as reference for our analysis. The lineshape param- 
eters are: Lorentzian width 2r=O.6 eV, Gaussian 
width 2y=O.3 eV, and the asymmetry parameter 
CI 
= 0.19. Two contributions 
are found 
in this 
spectrum: a bulk peak (B) at 71.15 eV BE and a 
surface peak (S) at 70.75 eV BE. These results are 
quite close to those obtained on pure Pt surfaces 
[ 15,161. We use the same procedure to analyse all 
the recorded spectra. 
3.2. Growth of Pt/Cu(lOO) 
Fig. 2a shows the decomposition 
of the spectra 
corresponding 
to 
0.5-3 ML 
Pt 
deposition. 
Looking 
more closely at the evolution 
of the 
individual peak positions, we observe that even at 
the lowest coverage, two contributions 
are appar- 
ent in the Pt 4f,,, core level. This is confirmed in 
two ways: first, the width (FWMH) 
of the peak 
(0.9 eV) is too large compared with that expected 
for a single Pt 4f,,, peak (0.6 eV), and second, CO 
adsorption confirms the presence of a surface-like 
peak and a bulk-like peak (Fig. 1 
b). 
Up to 2 ML we found the same pair of peaks, 
i.e. a bulk-like peak (labelled B*) at 71.0f0.03 
eV, 
and 
a 
surface-like 
peak 
(labelled 
S*) 
at 70.6 +0.03 eV. Beyond 
2 ML, a third peak 
(labelled B) appears at 71.15 f 0.03 eV, while the 
intensity of B* decreases. For higher coverage, the 
peaks S* and B* disappear and we obtain a new 
surface peak S at 70.75 5 0.03 eV.

b) 
In Fig. 3 we plot the evolution of the normalised 
surface peak intensity (both S* and S), which is 
proportional 
to the Pt surface concentration, 
as 
function 
of the Pt coverage. 
Up to 1 ML, we 
observe a linear increase in the intensity. There 
then follows a flatter region between 1 and 2 ML 
where the surface peak intensity evolves slowly. 
The relative variation 
of the intensity is + 10%. 
Above and close to the appearance of the B and 
S peaks, the slope of the curve changes and the 
intensity increases linearly up to 6 ML. The same 
behaviour 
of the intensity curve has also been 
observed for both bulk and total emission. 
LEED 
patterns 
were monitored 
periodically 
during Pt deposition. The patterns were found to 
evolve from a sharp p(1 x 1) with low-intensity 
background 
to a diffuse p( 1 x 1) with high-inten- 
sity background 
for 3 ML deposition. For higher 
coverage, 
the p(1 x 1) patterns 
disappear 
com- 
pletely. Diffuse c(2 x 2) spots were also observed 
over a narrow range of beam energy near 130 eV, 
between 0.5 and 1.8 ML. At much larger cover- 
ages, these spots were not apparent. 
3.3. Annealing Pt/Cu(lOO) 
We also studied 
the thermal 
behaviour 
of 
Pt/Cu(lOO) 
thin hhns. As for Pt/Cu(lll) 
and 
Cu/Pt( 11 
l), we found that there is a small temper- 
ature range where we could follow experimentally 
the kinetics of dissolution (250-350°C). 
Figs. 2a 
and 2b show a lineshape analysis of the Pt 4f,,, 
spectrum before and after annealing for 30 min at 
300°C for an initial Pt deposition of 3 ML. The 
effects of annealing are two-fold: first, the inten- 
sities of B and S decrease, indicating 
that Pt 
diffuses into the Cu substrate, and second, the B 
and S peaks shift by 150 meV towards 
lower 
binding energy to the B* and S* positions, respec- 
tively. We also note that longer annealing does not 
affect the positions and the intensities of peaks S* 
and B*, indicating a blocking of the dissolution 
kinetics. 
After 
annealing, 
the LEED 
patterns 
became 
sharp 
c(2 x 2) with 
low background 
intensities. 
4. Discussion 
It is clear from Figs. 2a and 3 that the growth 
of Pt/Cu(lOO) 
differs from 
the layer-by-layer 
growth model [ 171. We can distinguish two sepa- 
rate stages in the growth process. 
(1) Up to 2 ML, we have evidence for the 
formation 
of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy at

room temperature. 
This picture of interdiffusion is 
strongly supported by the energy position of peaks 
B* and S*, since these two peaks have already 
been observed in the Cu,Pt( 100) bulk alloy [ 181 
and in annealed Pt/Cu( 100) (Fig. 2b). The S* and 
B* peaks correspond to surface and bulk Pt atoms 
in the Pt-Cu 
alloy 
environment, 
respectively. 
Moreover, 
the tendency of Cu to remain at the 
surface agrees well with previous 
ISS measure- 
ments [ 121. Between 1 and 2 ML, the Pt surface 
peak intensity stabilises along a plateau. Taking as 
reference the Pt ( 100) surface and measuring the 
relative intensity of the S* peak, we estimate an

average surface concentration 
of 50+5% Pt. This 
is in agreement with the c(2 x 2) LEED patterns. 
(2) At 2.1 ML, the situation changes, and we 
observe a new peak B. This peak corresponds 
to 
a pure bulk-Pt environment, 
indicating the pres- 
ence of pure Pt domains in the surface-alloy film. 
For higher coverage, a pure Pt thin film grows, 
giving rise to a pure Pt surface peak (S) and a 
bulk peak (B). Since the alloy S* and B* peaks 
disappear and the Pt 4f7,2 total intensity continues 
to increase, we interpret this as a sign of Pt-Cu 
de-mixing. We also note that the Pt 4f,,, intensity 
does not stabilise with increasing coverage, and Pt 
grows as disordered 
islands [ 171. This situation 
(alloying 
and 
dealloying) 
has 
been 
already 
observed for Au/Cu( 100) [ 191, but at a different 
critical thickness (0.5 ML for Au/Cu). This differ- 
ence can be attributed 
to the tendency of Au to 
segregate in AuCu, unlike the Pt-Cu system where 
the Cu is the segregating compound. An exhaustive 
comparison between the two systems will be tack- 
led elsewhere. 
Annealing Pt/Cu( 100) leads to the same surface 
alloy as during growth (with a more precise Pt 
surface concentration, 
i.e. 5OrfI 
1%). The c(2 x 2) 
952 
R Belkhou et al. /Surface 
Science 377-379 
(1997) 948-952 
LEED patterns also became more sharp, indicating 
a better order. 
As in the case of Pt/Cu( 111) and Cu/Pt( 1 
1 
1 
), 
the surface alloy formed 
can correspond 
to a 
surface stochiometry 
characteristic 
of a top layer 
of a bulk-alloy ordered phase (Cu,Pt, Ll,). This 
ordered 
phase 
gives 
a succession 
of 
mixed 
Pt&u50 
planes and pure Cu planes in the (100) 
direction. However, this alternate stacking in the 
bulk does not fit our experimantal data, since the 
corresponding 
calculated Pt 4f,,, bulk intensity is 
lower than that which was measured. Moreover, 
despite the precise knowledge of the surface con- 
centration, 
we can at this point only estimate an 
average 
Pt 
concentration 
in 
the 
sublayers. 
Assuming that the depth profile is uniform, and 
using a mean free path from Ballard’s formula 
[20] (4 A), we have calculated an average concen- 
tration in the sublayers of 25% Pt (Cu,Pt) over 
the first five underlayers 
for 2 ML of Pt. This 
result, which is close to that obtained 
on the 
Cu( 111) surface, 
is only a statistical 
average 
and may not bear any resemblance 
to the real 
composition. 
From 
these results, the bulk ordered 
phase 
appears to be the main driving force in the forma- 
tion of this kind of surface alloy. However, it is 
interesting 
to note that unlike the (111) face, 
interdiffusion 
is achieved even at room temper- 
ature. This is explained by the high value of the 
relative surface free energy for an open face, which 
favours Cu segregation for the (100) face. 
5. Summary 
We have studied the growth mode of Pt/Cu( 100) 
at room temperature. 
Up to 2 ML, we observe the 
formation 
of a surface alloy. Above 2 ML, the 
system demixes and pure Pt disordered 
islands 
start to grow. Surface alloy formation 
has been 
also 
obtained 
by 
thermal 
dissolution 
of 
Pt/Cu( 100). The top layer of this alloy is an 
ordered c(2 x 2) Cu,,Pt,,. 
In the sublayers the 
average 
composition 
is Cu,Pt. 
Photoelectron 
diffraction experiments were carried out to investi- 
gate more precisely the depth profile concentration 
and the chemical order of this surface alloy. The 
results, together with multiple scattering calcula- 
tions, will be published soon.
