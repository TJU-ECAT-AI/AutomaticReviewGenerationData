The need for naphtha reforming to produce high quality reformate for gasoline blend stocks with
increased yield has become more urgent due to dwindling crude oil reserves and stringent air pollution
regulations. Reforming catalysts prepared using polyacrylic acid (PAA) as a metal ion template exhib-
ited 1.4–2.4% improvement in reformate yield and 1.0–2.0 wt% lower aromatic production compared to
commercially available catalysts prepared using traditional metal salt coimpregnation methods, while
maintaining a comparably high octane number. The catalyst prepared using the PAA template also showed
higher liquid recovery with less coke deposition and longer projected catalyst lifetime. Characterization
using infrared spectroscopy following the adsorption of CO revealed that catalysts made using the PAA
method contained platinum particle surfaces with reduced atom coordination numbers.

1. Introduction
The catalytic reforming process has the main objective of
transforming virgin naphtha cuts of low octane number into
gasoline blend stocks with high octane number. Despite the sig-
niﬁcant progress in reforming process design and control over
the last half century, the catalyst continues to be the heart of the
reforming process, and has attracted intense research interest. At
present, industrial catalysts are based on Pt–Re and Pt–Ir in semi-
regenerative or cyclic reforming processes, and Pt–Sn in continuous
regeneration processes [1,2].
Over the last ten years, declining crude oil reserves and increas-
ingly stringent air pollution regulations have driven research efforts
devoted to: (1) producing gasoline with high octane number to
achieve more efﬁcient use of crude oil and (2) lowering aro-
matic (benzene) volume in reformate while maintaining high
octane number [3,4]. Presently, most studies for improving reform-
ing bimetallic catalysts have focused on modifying the support
[5,6], optimizing preparation and pretreatment conditions, and
incorporating a third or even fourth metallic additive [7,8]. Some
improvements in activity, selectivity and lifetime of catalysts have
been achieved, but improvements have not kept pace with the mar-

ket’s demand [4]. The inherent complexities in both the supported
bimetallic catalyst system and the reforming reactions themselves
make it difﬁcult to achieve signiﬁcant progress in the above-
mentioned ﬁelds.
In the present study, we applied polyacrylic acid (PAA) as a
template to control the Pt nanoparticle surface structures during
preparation of Pt–Re/Al2O3 reforming catalysts. Characterization
studies have revealed that Pt nanoparticle surfaces with lower coor-
dination numbers have been preferentially exposed with use of
the PAA template as compared to commercial catalysts prepared
by the metal salt coimpregnation method. These improved cata-
lysts have shown an increased reformate yield with lower aromatic
production and longer projected life time.

Naphtha A was received from BP and naphtha B was received
from ExxonMobil Corporation.
High purity -Al2O3 (1.60 mm diameter extrudes, BET sur-
face area 200 m2 g−1, density 0.68 g cm−3, total pore volume
0.57 cm3 g−1) was bought from Saint-Gobain NorPro. Dihydrogen
hexachloroplatinate (IV) hydrate (39.00 wt% Pt) and perrhenic acid
solution (53.72 wt% Re) were purchased from Colonial Metals, Inc.
Polyacrylic acid solution (45 wt%, Mw ∼1200) was bought from the
Lubrizol Corporation.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
Supported Pt/Re catalysts with polyacrylic acid as template were
prepared following a sequence of precursor solution preparation,
support impregnation and supported precursor calcination. Cata-
lyst PAAPt/Re0.25, for example, was prepared using the following
steps and concentrations.
A desired amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O and perrhenic acid were dis-
solved in water separately to make a platinum solution at 20.0 mg
Pt/g and a rhenium solution at 27.3 mg Re/g. Then 7.50 g of the
platinum solution was mixed with 8.79 g of the rhenium solu-
tion, to which 3.08 g of 37.0% hydrochloride acid and 38.0 g of
water were added while stirring. 5.49 g of 45 wt% polyacrylic acid
sodium solution (Mw ∼1200) was added to the mixture followed by
purge with nitrogen (40 cm3 min−1, 1 h), and reduction by hydro-
gen (40 cm3 min−1, 30 min). The vessel was then sealed and stirred
for 12 h.
60.0 g of -Al2O3 (pre-soaked in excess water for 2 h) was
impregnated with the Pt–Re precursor solution. The mixture was
gradually heated under rotation to remove excess water till the
support was almost dry and then further dried in a lab oven at
423 K for 12 h. The supported precursor was calcined in a muf-
ﬂe furnace at 772 K for 4 h with air relative humidity at 30%. Pt
and Re loadings were conﬁrmed by ICP analysis and the Cl content
was determined by potentiometric titration (0.25% Pt, 0.40% Re and
1.0–1.10% Cl).
Catalyst PAAPt/Re0.3 (0.30% Pt, 0.30% Re) and PAAPt/Re1.0
(1.00% Pt, 1.00% Re) were prepared using the same procedure as
described above except proportionally increasing the amounts of
metals and polyacrylic acid.
Benchmark catalysts Pt/Re0.25 (0.25% Pt, 0.40% Re), Pt/Re1.0
(1.00% Pt, 1.00% Re) and 1%Re/Al2O3 (1.0% Re) for characteriza-
tion were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method
according to published literature [9]. Aqueous solutions of dihydro-
gen hexachloroplatinate (IV) hydrate and perrhenic acid were used
as the metal precursors. After impregnation, the supported precur-
sors were dried overnight at 423 K and then calcined at 772 K for
4 h.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
The composition of the metal function was determined on a dual
view ICP (Teledyne Leeman, Prodigy) with the samples digested by
aqua regia. Chlorine on the support was determined by the poten-
tiometric titration with 0.014 N of silver nitrate on Metrohm 836
titrator.
The BET surface areas were calculated from the adsorp-
tion isotherms of nitrogen at 77 K on a volumetric adsorption
system (Micromeritics TriStar surface area and porosity ana-
lyzer). All samples were degassed at 393 K for 2 h before BET
measurements.
Pulse chemisorption of CO experiment was performed to ana-
lyze the accessible metal fraction of Pt. The samples were reduced
under H2 at 723 K for 1 h, purged with helium at 723 K for 1 h and
then cooled down to 313 K. The calibrated volume of CO (19.3 L,
70 kPa, 297 K) was sent to the reactor. CO absorption was monitored
by a TCD detector and the saturated absorption was indicated by
no change in a series of absorption peaks.
Coke analysis was performed on a TruSpec®CHN instrument to
determine the amount of carbon deposited.

of ∼40 mg were pressed onto a rectangular tungsten mesh
(2.4 cm × 1 cm, 100 mesh, 0.0254 mm wire diameter, Alfa Aesar),
with spot-welded chromel–alumel thermocouple wires to monitor
the temperature. The tungsten mesh was supported to a mount-
ing bracket made of nickel connected at the end of a Z-translator
manipulator feedthrough, which was connected for resistive heat-
ing. The stainless steel IR cell, consisting of BaF2 windows, allowed
for in situ reduction of samples and spectroscopic measurements of
surface species, as described previously [10]. Spectra were recorded
at room temperature with 4 cm−1 spectral resolution by collecting
128 scans using a Nicolet-510 FTIR spectrometer equipped with
a MCT-A (mercury cadmium telluride) detector. To remove water
and other impurities the cell was ﬁrst evacuated to a pressure below
10−4 Pa for 60 min. The catalyst was then reduced at 723 K in 4 kPa
hydrogen for 30 min followed by evacuation and a high tempera-
ture ﬂash (723 K) to remove any surface species generated during
reduction. The reduction cycle was repeated three times for fully
reduction of Pt. The IR spectrum was recorded after introducing
1 kPa CO into the IR cell at room temperature followed by evacua-
tion at 373 K.
Samples for the scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) analysis were prepared by rubbing the beads against
each other covered with isopropanol. A drop from the result-
ing suspension was placed on a Cu grid and dried in air. These
samples were examined by a JEOL 2010F TEM/STEM operated at
80–200 kV.
2.4. Naphtha reforming reaction
Naphtha reforming experiments were conducted in a com-
puter controlled pilot plant reaction system with 19.5 g of naphtha
reforming catalyst loaded in each test. The catalyst was diluted by
sands and packed in a stainless tube reactor with 2.54 cm inner
diameter. Reactor was heated by tube furnace controlled with a
predesigned auto program. The catalyst was reduced in hydrogen at
772 K for 3 h followed by pre-sulﬁdation with 250 ppm H2S in H2 at
644 K for 40 min (about 0.25% sulfur was added). About 30 min after
presuldiation, naphtha feed was charged to the reactor through a
GC pump at 644 K. The pump was set at a low rate initially and grad-
ually increased with caution to avoid large exotherm till the desired
pump rate was reached. After the reactor was stabilized at the
target feed rate, the reactor temperature was gradually increased
to the reaction temperature. Liquid product was collected every
8 h after the desired reactor temperature was reached. During the
reaction, the reactor temperature was precisely controlled to avoid
unaccepted ﬂuctuation (T < 1.67 K). The composition of the tail
gas from the reactor was monitored by on-line GC equipped with
three analytic channels. Mass balance was evaluated as the main
indicator of test reliability. If the ﬂuctuation in mass balance was
over ±3%, the test data was examined carefully and the repeated
test was performed. In the calculation of catalyst performance, the
PONA results were corrected for dissolved C3–C4 species into the
gas and the gaseous C5–C6 species into the liquid products. The
variation of reported C5+% yield was within ±0.3 wt%.
The aging tests were performed by raising the reactor tempera-
ture so as to maintain the RON at around 99, keeping other process
variables constant: naphtha A, LHSV at 2.0, H2 pressure at 1.03 MPa,
H2/HC molar ratio at 3:1, Cl injected at 4 ppm rate in mixture of
teterachlorine ethylene and methanol (w/w: 1:4). The temperature
was increased in 2.8 K (5 ◦F) steps.

2.5. Reforming product analysis
Reformate hydrocarbon composition was analyzed using a

as
a
PONA
(parafﬁns–oleﬁns–naphthenes–aromatics) analysis on a Agilent
6850 GC equipped with a Fast DHA column (PAC Company,
40.0 m × 100 m × 0.20 m, model no.: AC10.74.013) and a FID
detector. 0.1 L sample was injected for each analysis with helium
as carrier gas. The oven program was set as 308 K (holding for
5 min), 308–318 K at 5 K/min (3 min), 318–333 K at 2 K/min (3 min),
333–523 K at 2 K/min (3 min) and totally about 118 min per anal-
ysis. This method in PONA analysis is based on ASTM D6293-98.
The petroleum standard sample, Gasoline B, was bought from the
same company with a composition of (wt%): reformate 45%, iso-
merate 9%, alkylate 10%, FCC naphtha 25%, ETBE 10% and ethanol
1%. Peak assignment in the sample spectrum was conducted by
a careful comparison with the standard gasoline spectrum. If the
corresponding retaining peak could not be found in the standard
gasoline spectrum, the peak in the analytic samples was included
to the unknown category (Un). The variation of each component
was less than 0.7 wt%.
Research octane number (RON) of reformate was determined
on the near IR octane meter (Zeltex, ZX l01C). Each sample was
tested at least three times in order to receive a stable reading. The
ZX-101C meter has been carefully calibrated to measure accurate
octane readings with the ﬂuctuation less than 0.3%. The calibration
is traceable to ASTM 2699 and 2700.
The reformate API (density) test was performed on Mettler
Toledo DE45 density meter.
Gaseous products composed of hydrogen, C1–C4 hydrocarbons
and a small amount of non-condensed gasoline, mainly C5–C6, were
analyzed by an on-line Agilent 3000A Micro GC equipped with three
analytic channels. Hydrogen and methane were analyzed on the
ﬁrst channel with argon as carrier gas (Back ﬂush injection; Pro-
column: Agilent Plot U, 3 m × 0.32 mm × 30 m; Analytic column:
Agilent MS 5A, 10 m × 0.32 mm × 30 m, TCD detector). The C1–C2
species were measured on the second channel equipped with Plot
U column with helium as the carries gas (Back ﬂush injection; Pro-
column: Agilent Plot Q, 1 m × 0.32 mm × 10 m; Analytic column:
Agilent Plot U, 8 m × 0.32 mm ×30 m, TCD detector). In the third
channel, C3–C6 hydrocarbons were analyzed on OV-1 column with
helium as carrier gas (variable volume injector; analytic column:
8 m × 0.15 mm × 2.0 m, TCD detector).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst preparation
The supported Pt–Re catalysts were prepared following a
sequence of precursor solution preparation, support impregnation
and supported precursor calcination. Extensive investigation of the
effects of the amount and molecular weight of polyacrylic acid on
the ﬁnal catalyst performance has shown that polyacrylic acid with
molecular weight of 1200–2500 and molar ratio of carboxylic acid
groups to metals (A/M) of 15–20 are preferred. PAA with molecular
weight over 3000 and/or A/M ratio over 25 caused difﬁculty during
the support impregnation step due to the high viscosity of the pre-
cursor solution. PAA with molecular weight lower than 1000 is not
commercially available and A/M lower than 10 provides less con-
trol of the metal ions, reducing the advantage in reformate yield of
the ﬁnal catalyst.
An appropriate volume of pre-prepared precursor solution was
coated on high purity -alumina by gradual evaporation of water
under rotation to provide the desired Pt and Re loading. The coated
-alumina was then calcined under a ﬂow of air with controlled

humidity in order to achieve about 1.0 wt% chlorine after calcina-
tion. Calcination temperature was carefully studied over the range
between 700 K and 772 K to avoid metal surface structure trans-
formation at high temperatures. Interestingly, calcination at 772 K
not only shows no obvious change on nanoparticle surface struc-
ture (as indicated by unchanged catalyst activity) but also provides
more stable activity during tests, which is a critical feature, enabling
the catalyst prepared by the PAA method to survive long duration
operations.
3.2. Naphtha catalytic reforming
Reproducible results of naphtha reforming tests were obtained
through precise process control. Product research octane number
(RON) and C5+ liquid yield were evaluated as the main criteria for
catalyst performance. In Fig. 1(A), performance results are shown
for naphtha reforming performed using a catalyst prepared with
PAA as template with metal loadings of 0.25 wt% Pt and 0.40 wt%
Re (PAAPt/Re0.25) and a commercial catalyst with the same metal
loadings (ComPt/Re0.25). The feed for these tests is designated as
naphtha A, a commercial naphtha cut with high levels of naph-
thenes and aromatics (N + 2A: 64.4, Table 1), which therefore tends
to be an easy feed for catalytic reforming. The reactions were con-
ducted at 766 K, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 1.6, hydrogen
pressure of 2.24 MPa and H2/HC molar ratio of 10:1 without chlo-
rine addition during the tests. The reforming test was ﬁnished
within 72 h to avoid complications related to changes in catalyst
activity due to loss of Cl from the catalyst. The ﬁrst 16 h on stream
was set as the catalyst stabilizing period. The product collected at
the 72nd hour was also excluded from catalyst performance evalu-
ations in order to exclude the effect of decreased chlorine. As seen
in Fig. 1(A), catalyst PAAPt/Re0.25 provides an average C5+ yield at

84.2% and outperforms the commercial catalyst ComPt/Re0.25 by
1.4%. The average octane numbers from both catalysts over the 40 h
period were almost identical at 99.1, with catalyst PAAPt/Re0.25
showing more stable activity (RON decreased 0.7 on PAAPt/Re0.25,
1.6 on ComPt/Re0.25).
To further conﬁrm the advantage of the PAA template and to
examine its adaptability to the typical variations of commercial
naphtha feed, naphtha B was evaluated in Fig. 1(B). Naphtha B
is a commercial feed with much lower levels of naphthenes and
aromatics (N + 2A: 40.5, Table 1), making it more difﬁcult for cat-
alytic reforming than naphtha A. Catalyst PAAPt/Re0.3 (0.3 wt%
Pt, 0.3 wt% Re) was prepared with the same procedure as for
PAAPt/Re0.25, except for the increased metal loading. Commer-
cial catalyst ComPt/Re0.3 with the same metal loading (0.3 wt% Pt,
0.3 wt% Re) was tested as the benchmark for comparison. The reac-
tion conditions were adjusted as needed to achieve reasonably high
reformate octane number for gasoline blend stocks. The resulting
conditions were temperature of 769 K, liquid hourly space velocity
(LHSV) of 1.2, hydrogen pressure of 2.07 MPa, H2/HC molar ratio of
5:1 and no chlorine addition during the tests. As seen in Fig. 1(B),
catalyst PAAPt/Re0.3 shows an average C5+ yield at 79.3% and out-
performs the catalyst ComPt/Re0.3 by 2.4%. However, the average
octane number from catalyst PAAPt/Re0.3 over the 40 h period
was at 98.3 and 0.5 point lower than from the benchmark cata-
lyst ComPt/Re0.3. Catalyst PAAPt/Re0.3 also exhibited more stable
activity during the test as indicated by reduced ﬂuctuation in the
reformate RON number.
Detailed analysis of the hydrocarbon composition of the refor-
mates (Table 1) shows that products from catalyst PAAPt/Re0.25
contain about 1.0 wt% less aromatics and 0.8–1.0 wt% higher
isoparafﬁns than the samples collected at the same time point from
catalyst ComPt/Re0.25. These variations in aromatic and isoparaf-
ﬁn concentration counteract each other’s effect on the product
RON number so as to maintain the similar overall RON number.
Further analysis of the corresponding ﬂue gas samples revealed
that about 0.5–0.8 mol% less C1–C4 species were produced by cata-
lyst PAAPt/Re0.25, with a correspondingly higher concentration of
hydrogen.
Similar trends were observed in the tests with naphtha B.
However, the concentration difference in aromatics and isoparaf-
ﬁns between products from PAAPt/Re0.3 and ComPt/Re0.3 was
greater, at 2.0 wt% and 1.6 wt%, respectively. In the products from
PAAPt/Re0.3, the effect of decreased aromatics on RON number
was not completely compensated by the higher concentration of
isoparafﬁns, resulting in a 0.5 point reduction in the average RON
number as compared to the product from ComPt/Re0.3. Similar to
the results on naphtha A, the ﬂue gas from naphtha B showed
0.7 mol% less C1–C4 species produced by catalyst PAAPt/Re0.3.
Based on these observations, we speculate that the higher refor-
mate yield obtained using catalysts with PAA as the template is a
result of reduced hydrocracking and/or hydrogenolysis side reac-
tions.
The stability of catalysts prepared with PAA as template was
evaluated by accelerated coking tests (aging test) at higher severity.
These tests were performed by raising the reactor temperature so as
to maintain the RON at around 99, keeping other process variables
constant (naphtha A, LHSV at 2.0, H2 pressure at 1.03 MPa, H2/HC
molar ratio at 3:1, Cl injected at 4 ppm). As shown in Fig. 2, com-
pared to catalyst ComPt/Re0.25, the ﬁrst temperature adjustment
for catalyst PAAPt/Re0.25 occurred slightly earlier. In the middle
segment of run, the temperature adjustments for the two catalysts
coincided. However, in the latter stages of the run, the required
temperature adjustments for catalyst PAAPt/Re0.25 occurred later
than the commercial catalyst. In addition, slightly higher C5+ yield
from PAAPt/Re0.25 was observed even at the high severity in the
late period of the test.
Analyses of the coke deposited on the used catalysts after the
normal condition tests in Fig. 1(A) and the aging tests in Fig. 2
are summarized in Table 2. Less coke was deposited on the used
PAAPt/Re0.25 catalyst (8.01 wt%) than on the used ComPt/Re0.25
catalyst (8.37 wt%) after the 328-h aging test, which contributes to
the delay in the required temperature adjustments and the slightly
higher C5+ yield observed for catalyst PAAPt/Re0.25 near the end of
the aging test. Less coking was also indicated by the reduced surface
area loss on the used catalysts as compared to the corresponding
fresh catalysts (15.0% loss in used PAAPt/Re0.25, 19.8% loss in used
ComPt/Re0.25). The chlorine on the used catalysts (PAAPt/Re0.25
and ComPt/Re0.25) after the aging test are at 0.6–0.7 wt% of the sup-
port, which is the same as on the used catalysts after the normal
condition test, conﬁrming that the 4 ppm Cl injection rate selected
for the aging test was appropriate to maintain stable catalyst con-
ditions.
3.3. Catalyst characterization
Shape-controlled synthesis of metal nanoparticles using organic
templates has been extensively investigated [11–14]. Among the
reported organic templates, which range from small molecules
to polymers, polyacrylic acid is of particular interest for the cur-
rent study because of its linear structure and its afﬁnity to metal
ions, resulting from its abundant carboxylic acid groups that
provide the possibility to control metal ions before and during
metal reduction. In catalytic chemistry, control of metal atoms
is extremely important because most metal-catalyzed reactions
are metal surface structure sensitive [15]. This certainly applies to
naphtha reforming, since key reactions including dehydrocycliza-
tion, hydrogenolysis and coking are known to be sensitive to metal
surface structures [4]. Therefore, use of PAA during the preparation
of reforming catalysts is an attractive approach to improve their
performance.

Fig. 2. Accelerated coking tests on PAAPt/Re0.25 and ComPt/Re0.25 with naphtha A as feed.
To investigate the effect of the PAA template on metal nanopar-
ticle size before and after reforming tests, a catalyst with loading
of 0.25 wt% Pt and 0.40 wt% Re (Pt/Re0.25) was prepared using a
conventional coimpregnation method and used as a characteriza-
tion benchmark. This benchmark catalyst was evaluated in the pilot
plant test and produced similar RON number and reformate yield
as the commercial catalyst ComPt/Re0.25 described above. In Fig. 3,
dark ﬁeld TEM images were obtained on the catalyst PAAPt/Re/0.25
and Pt/Re0.25 before reduction (A and B), after reduction at 723 K
(C and D) and after a 328 h aging test (E and F). For the fresh PAA-
containing catalyst (A), a small number of Pt nanoparticles were
detected; no Pt particles could be resolved in the comparative fresh
catalyst (B). The nanoparticles detected below 5 nm in the fresh
PAAPt/Re0.25 were mainly produced by partial reduction with H2
occurring during precursor solution preparation. A few nanoparti-
cles around 5–10 nm may be produced by reduction with organic
species derived from PAA, which would be present during the sup-
port impregnation step, initiated by the high local temperature.

PAAPt/Re0.25 and Pt/Re0.25 catalysts both exhibited large num-
bers of nanoparticles with a uniform size of about 1 nm (C and D),
which are responsible for the high activity exhibited by both cat-
alysts at the beginning of naphtha reforming reaction. The small
amount of large Pt nanoparticles in PAA-containing catalyst (as in
A) was still detectable after reduction.
The nanoparticles in the used catalysts PAAPt/Re0.25 and
Pt/Re0.25 after the 328-h aging test were found in considerably
higher concentration and with a larger average particle size due to
more complete reduction of platinum and nanoparticle aggregation
(E and F). The average platinum particle size in both used catalysts
was around 6–7 nm, much larger than that (∼1 nm) in the cata-
lysts obtained immediately after reduction (C and D). Both catalysts
also showed a small number of much larger particles (15–20 nm)
after the aging tests. The TEM-XEDS spectra show that nanopar-
ticles (bright spots) in (E) and (F) are more Pt enriched and other
areas of the support matrix are Re enriched, which suggests that Pt
and Re are not primarily present as a true alloy after the aging test.
Pulse chemisorption of CO on catalysts PAAPt/Re0.25 and
Pt/Re0.25 were performed to estimate the accessible fraction of
the contained Pt. Both catalysts were reduced under hydrogen at
723 K for 1 h (the same conditions as in Fig. 3(C and D)). The results
show no obvious difference between the two catalysts, with CO/Pt
ratio at 0.47 and 0.50 for PAAPt/Re0.25 and Pt/Re0.25, respectively.
Although the use of CO and H2 chemisorption to measure metal-
lic dispersion may be unreliable for bimetallic catalysts due to the
effect of the second metal [16], the CO chemisorption results in
the present study are consistent with TEM characterization and
indicate that average size of dominant nanoparticles are similar
in the two reduced catalysts, regardless of a few large particles in
PAAPt/Re0.25.
Infrared spectroscopy of absorbed CO has been used to inves-
tigate metal surface structure. The relationship between the
structure of metal surfaces and infrared vibrational frequency of
adsorbed CO has been studied both theoretically and experimen-
tally on supported metal particles as well as on single-crystal
surfaces [17]. In previous studies of reforming catalysts, Rochester
group [18,19] and Parera group [7] have found that the positions of
(CO) bands due to linearly absorbed CO on Pt are a function of Pt
dispersion. Highly dispersed Pt gives bands at lower wavenumbers
than poorly dispersed Pt, due to the differing extent of coordina-
tion of exposed Pt atoms. Normally, the linear-CO absorption band
is in the region 2100–1950 cm−1, while the bridged-CO absorption
band is in the region 1900–1800 cm−1.
In this study, to acquire sufﬁcient IR signal strength for adsorbed
CO, model catalysts with enhanced metal loading PAAPt/Re1.0
and Pt/Re1.0 (1.0 wt% Pt, 1.0 wt% Re), together with 1.0 wt% Re on
alumina (1% Re/Al2O3), were prepared. The catalysts were fully
reduced at 723 K under 4 kPa hydrogen followed by saturation CO
adsorption at room temperature. The IR spectra were recorded after
the samples were heated to 373 K under vacuum to remove weakly
adsorbed CO.
In Fig. 4, the 1% Re/Al2O3 prereduced at 723 K showed a weak
peak of adsorbed CO at 1999 cm−1 after exposure to 1 kPa CO
that was complete disappeared after further evacuation at 373 K.

This suggested that Re reduction was far from complete at 723 K.
Rochester et al. [18] disclosed that in Pt/Re bimetallic catalyst, Re
was well reduced at 893 K for 12 h and gave much stronger CO
adsorbed band. However, this reduction temperature is far above
the temperature range typically adopted for reforming catalysts

pretreatment (including calcination and reduction). In the tests of
the catalyst PAA Pt/Re1.0 and Pt/Re1.0 (Fig. 5) which were reduced
and tested under the same conditions as in Fig. 4, the possible con-
tribution from Re–CO to the overall band envelop was relatively
small. No Re–CO band was detected in the spectra in Fig. 5 although
it could have been present but was obscured by the dominant Pt–CO
band (Re–CO [18]: 2112, 2007, 1963, 1933 cm−1).
As seen in Fig. 5, the catalyst PAAPt/Re1.0 shows a modiﬁed
absorption peak structure compared with catalyst Pt/Re1.0 in both
linear and bridged CO absorption regions. The higher wavenum-
ber of peak maximum at 2089 cm−1 in Fig. 5(A) compared to at
2067 cm−1 in Fig. 5(B) is possibly contributed by CO absorption on
the surface of large Pt nanoparticle, regardless of its relatively low
concentration.

The ﬁttings shown in Fig. 5 (dash lines) were obtained by forcing the
peak position for the linear absorption band to a ﬁxed wavenum-
ber. This allowed for a quantitative estimation of the peak area ratio

of bridged adsorption to linear adsorption (B/L). For the PAA con-
taining catalyst, the bridged absorption band was very weak, with
a B/L ratio of 0.039:1 as compared to 0.37:1 for catalyst Pt/Re1.0.
The lower B/L ratio of CO adsorption suggests that surface Pt atoms
in PAAPt/Re1.0 have lower Pt coordination numbers. Based on this
ﬁnding, the linear CO absorption on surface Pt atom with less coor-
dination number also possibly contributed to the peak absorption at
2089 cm−1 in Fig. 5(A), as disclosed in the studies of CO absorption
on Pt single crystal facets (linear-CO [20]: 2090 cm−1 on Pt(1 1 0),
2070 cm−1 on Pt(1 0 0), and 2060 cm−1 on Pt(1 1 1); the surface Pt
atom in Pt (1 1 0) facet has the least coordination number).
Platinum atoms with lower coordination number are thought to
be more resistant to coking [19]. The IR results are therefore con-
sistent with the observation of reduced coking on catalysts using
PAA template during the accelerated coking experiments (Table 2),
a result which further experimentally suggested the presence of
novel Pt surface structure in the reforming catalysts using PAA as
template.
In preliminary pilot-plant test the catalyst using PAA template
successfully went through two successive regeneration processes
without notably decrease in RON and C5+% yield, which further
afﬁrm its potential for industrial application.
4. Conclusion
In summary, polyacrylic acid has been used as a metal ion tem-
plate in the synthesis of Pt/Re/-alumina reforming catalysts. These
catalysts delivered 1.4–2.4% higher reformate yield together with
longer projected lifetime for different naphtha feeds than commer-
cial catalysts prepared by metal salts coimpregnation methods. The
high reformate yield may be caused by a reduction in hydrocrack-
ing and/or hydrogenolysis side reactions. Characterization using
FTIR-CO absorption revealed the less bridged CO absorption in
the catalyst using polyacrlic acid template, which suggested that
surface Pt atom with less coordination number was displayed.
Although the mechanism of enhanced exposure of less coordinated
surface atoms by use of the PAA template is still under investiga-
tion, the performance advantages of the PAA template are clear. Use
of polyacrylic acid in preparation of reforming catalysts is readily
scaled-up without adding signiﬁcant cost to catalyst manufactur-
ing. Considering that global reforming production totals at least
11 million barrels per day (56.8% from semiregenerative process),
even a 1% reformate yield improvement will impact a reﬁnery’s
proﬁt margin substantially.
