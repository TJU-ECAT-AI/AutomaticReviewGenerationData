Abstract
Semiempirical methods for prediction of thermochemical properties of adsorbed oxygenates are developed. Periodic density functional theory calculations are used to study the relative stability of ethanol, ethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, and glycerol dehydrogenation intermediates on Pt(111). For ethylene glycol dehydrogenation intermediates, it is found that the thermodynamically favored intermediates at each level of dehydrogenation are as follows: HOCH2CHOH, HOCHCHOH, HOCHCOH, HOCCOH ≈ HOCHCO, HOCCO, OCCO. Structural and energetic patterns emerge from these C2HxO2 adsorption calculations that lead to the formation of group additive properties for thermochemical property prediction of oxygenates on Pt(111). Finally, linear scaling relationships of atomic binding energy are used to predict the binding energy of the C2HxO2 species on the Ni(111) surface and Ni−Pt−Pt(111) bimetallic surface. It is shown that the linear scaling relationships can accurately predict the binding energy of larger oxygenates as well as of oxygenates on bimetallic catalysts. Corrections for ring strain and weak oxygen−metal and hydrogen-bonding interactions are added to increase the accuracy of group additivity and linear scaling relationships.

1 Introduction
Recent interest in the utilization of biomass feedstocks for chemical and energy production has increased to alleviate some of the economic and environmental burden of fossil resources. (1) Reforming of biomass to synthesis gas is particularly attractive because of the potential uses of synthesis gas, which include the production of liquid fuels via the Fischer−Tropsch synthesis reaction, ammonia synthesis for fertilizers, use of H2 directly for electricity in fuel cell applications, and the production of value-added chemicals. There have been recent experimental successes in reforming technologies ranging from the lower temperature aqueous-phase reforming of oxygenates, (2-8) to the higher temperature, low contact time, autothermal steam reforming of oxygenates. (9-14) Advances in fundamental understanding of mechanisms associated with oxygenate reforming have occurred through the combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) experimentation. (15-26) Chen and co-workers have supplemented temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) experiments with DFT calculations to determine the importance of initial O−H bond cleavage to oxygenate reforming rates and to discover the highly active Ni−Pt−Pt catalyst. (15-21) Similarly, Medlin and co-workers have applied the same techniques (EELS, TPD, DFT) to better understand the hydrogenation of olefins containing varying functional groups, (27) as well as the decomposition of larger oxygenates. (28) Alcalá et al. performed a complete set of DFT calculations on ethanol dehydrogenation intermediates and began to predict the reactivity of these intermediates to C−C and C−O bond cleaving reactions. Ethylene glycol has been identified as a biomass surrogate that is considered representative of larger polyols and sugars. (14, 15)
While DFT-based kinetic models have increased the understanding of reaction mechanisms involved in reforming of C1 oxygenates, (24, 29-31) a large gap remains in extending information from these smaller oxygenates to larger, more complex oxygenates that are representative of biomass feedstocks. Computationally, the number of reactions in a complete mechanism, as well as the expense associated with calculating individual model parameters (binding energy, activation energy, pre-exponential factor, etc.), scales with the size of the fuel molecule of interest. Hence, moving from a C1 oxygenate of interest to a C2 or C3 oxygenate requires considerable computational resources. For this reason, semiempirical methods must be utilized to reduce computational expense, while still being adequately predictive.
In an analogous problem, Benson introduced group additive methods in the 1960s to ease the kinetic modeling of gas-phase processes. (32-34) Since then, group additive techniques have been refined for accuracy, (35) and higher-order corrections have been formulated to allow for automated and accurate calculations of thermochemical mappings of entire reaction mechanisms. (36, 37) These methods are often used as a first pass model, from which more accurate refinement of important model parameters can take place. This allows for highly expensive calculations to be used on the most important model parameters as part of hierarchical multiscale refinement. (29) Goddard and co-workers extended this framework to surface processes, by developing group contributions to predict the stability of adsorbed hydrocarbon fragments on several transition metals. (38)
Building on these semiempirical methods for thermochemistry estimation, the first objective of this work is to develop group contributions for oxygenated hydrocarbons on platinum. These groups are compatible with the groups derived by Goddard (38) and Benson, (34) and can thus be used together as a powerful tool for efficient prediction of relative stability of adsorbed polyols.
While this semiempirical technique can be useful in extending the models of smaller oxygenates to larger oxygenates, there is still a need for inexpensive screening of surface reactivity for material design. Deriving group contributions for every individual surface of interest will still bear an enormous computational expense. The second objective of this work is to extend group additivity to various metals. At the heart of this problem is the identification of model descriptors. Previous work by Skoplyak et al. found a linear relationship between the d-band center of a metal and oxygenate reforming activity. (18) Further, they identified Ni−Pt−Pt as an active catalyst for ethanol and ethylene glycol reforming. (18-20) A general, albeit empirical approach, which has proven to work well for smaller adsorbates, (30, 39-41) is the unity bond index- quadratic exponential potential (UBI-QEP) method developed by Shustorovich and co-workers. (42) Within this framework, atomic binding energy is used as a descriptor for molecular binding energy and for activation barriers. Nørskov and co-workers have recently proposed linear scaling relationships that allow for the estimation of molecular binding energies on surfaces, as a function of atomic binding energies. (43-45) These scaling relationships have been developed for simple hydrogenated species via a single atom−metal bond and proven useful for screening of surface reactivity, as Ferrin et al. used this tool, along with Brønsted−Evans−Polanyi relationships, to predict the activity of ethanol decomposition on several metal catalysts. (25)
The present work studies ethylene glycol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and glycerol dehydrogenation intermediates on Pt(111). From these calculations, group additive type contributions are developed for predicting thermochemical properties of adsorbed oxygenates. Additionally, second-order contributions to group additive properties including ring strain, weakly bound groups, and hydrogen bonding are discussed. Next, linear scaling relationships are applied to ethylene glycol dehydrogenation intermediates to predict binding energies on the Ni(111) and Ni−Pt−Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces for the purpose of probing the usefulness of this technique on larger oxygenates as well as on bimetallic catalysts. Furthermore, we add two second-order corrections to improve its accuracy. The first accounts for the strain in rings that form with the metal catalyst, and the second accounts for weak binding modes of hydroxyl groups with the metal.
2 Quantum Mechanical Calculations
The energetics of this work were obtained using the SIESTA code, (46) which was used with Troullier−Martins norm-conserving scalar relativistic pseudopotentials. (47) A double-ζ plus polarization (DZP) basis set was utilized. The localization radii of the basis functions were determined from an energy shift of 0.01 eV. A standard DFT supercell approach with the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) form of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional (48) was implemented with a mesh cutoff of 200 Ry. We have used the nonspin polarized version to describe Pt-only surface systems. We include spin polarization for calculations that include Ni atoms, Co atoms, and for calculations of gas-phase species. Calculations on the Ni(111) surface and the Ni−Pt−Pt(111) surface are the only calculations that include Ni atoms. Only a few calculations were performed on Co(111) for adsorption of atomic oxygen and methanol on different sites. For all surfaces used in this study, a 4 layered, 3 × 3 unit cell was used. The lattice constants used for the Pt and Ni surfaces were 4.02 and 3.52 Å, respectively. The Ni−Pt−Pt surface involves 3 layers of bulk Pt with a top layer of Ni. The surface Monkhorst Pack meshes of 5 × 5 × 1 k-point sampling in the surface Brillouin zone was used. The top two layers and the adsorbates were relaxed. In C adsorption on the bridge site of Ni(111) and Ni−Pt−Pt(111), the entire surface was frozen, and only the C was relaxed to avoid carbide formation. The surface Monkhorst Pack meshes of 3 × 3 × 1 k-point sampling in the surface Brillouin zone were used for the C3 set of oxygenates to accelerate the calculations. This smaller k-point sampling results in slightly lower accuracies for the C3 calculations. For gas-phase calculations, species are isolated in a cubic vacuum of length dimension 15 Å.
In several sections, adsorbate energetics are reported with respect to a gas-phase reference and hydrogen adsorbed on a separate slab. In these cases, the heat of formation (ΔHf,298) of adsorbed hydrogen is assumed to be −11.1 kcal/mol, which was calculated from the dissociative adsorption of H2. ΔHf,298 for gas-phase reference molecules was taken from the NIST database. (49) These values are −56.0, −94.3, −138.1, and −65.2 kcal/mol for ethanol (C2H5OH), ethylene glycol (C2H6O2), glycerol (C3H8O3), and isopropyl alcohol (C3H8O), respectively. Binding energies are taken to be the total energy of the adsorbate relaxed on the surface minus the energy of the clean, relaxed slab minus the energy of the adsorbate isolated in vacuum. For unstable adsorbates that cannot yield a relaxed structure in isolation, snap binding energies are reported. The snap binding energy calculations are identical to binding energy calculations with the exception that the gas-phase species is frozen in the structure of the adsorbate on the metal surface. Unless otherwise stated, energetic values reported are for the lowest energy configuration of the adsorbed molecule. Several reasonable configurations were sampled for each adsorbate, placing the binding atoms at various adsorption sites (top, bridge, etc.).
The procedure for vibrational frequency calculation is based on numerical calculation of the Hessian matrix used to calculate the force constants. The structure used for frequency calculation is a complete geometry optimization with all forces on atoms being less than 0.01 eV/Å. Metal atoms were constrained to the original optimization as all atoms of the adsorbate were displaced by 0.02 Bohr in all three Cartesian directions. Diagonalization of the Hessian matrix was followed by subsequent analysis to obtain vibrational frequencies of adsorbates, which are discussed in section 4 of this Article.
Temperature-dependent thermochemical properties of adsorbates are calculated from the DFT calculated vibrational frequencies. Within this framework, each mode of vibration contributes independently to the following thermodynamic properties: (50)
(1)
(2)
(3)
The summations in eqs 1−3 are over each vibrational frequency (i). Θνi corresponds to the characteristic vibrational temperature for each mode: (50)
(4)
For these calculations, the lowest two vibrational frequencies for each adsorbate are assumed to be frustrated translational degrees of freedom in orthogonal directions parallel to the surface. Via the methods described by Gokhale et al., (24) these frustrated translational modes are converted to frequencies and used in eqs 1−3. In this approximation, the barrier to surface diffusion for each species is estimated from its binding energy. (51) Additionally, the PV contribution to internal energy is assumed to be zero for the surface phase. (52) The zero-point energy for each molecule is calculated from ZPE = ∑1/2hν. (24)
The heats of formation (ΔHf,298) for intermediates in Table 1 are obtained through calculations similar to those used by Wang and Brezinsky. (53) In this scheme, G3B3 level (54, 55) quantum mechanical calculations are used to obtain reaction enthalpies, whereupon enthalpy of formation for previously unstudied reaction intermediates is calculated using a methodology involving isodesmic reactions. (53, 54, 56, 57) Where appropriate, ΔHf,298 values for previously studied molecules are taken from the NIST database. (49)

Development and use of semiempirical methods for probing polyol adsorption relies on knowledge and predictability of adsorption trends in polyols. The next section discusses the results of adsorption calculations of C2HxO2 species on Pt(111).
3 Quantum Mechanical Results of Ethylene Glycol Dehydrogenation Intermediates
3.1 Gas-Phase C2HxO2 Intermediates
Several ethylene glycol dehydrogenation intermediates can be studied away from the surface, in a vacuum. Figure 1 shows the structures of these 15 species, and Table 1 lists important structural and energetic properties of each intermediate. The remaining C2HxO2 species are unable to fully relax in a vacuum without undergoing structural rearrangement. Column three of Table 1 lists the energy of each intermediate relative to ethylene glycol with extra hydrogen atoms taken into account through the subtraction of the energy of molecular hydrogen in vacuum (the number of H2’s used is reflective of atom balance, i.e., 1/2H2 is used for C2H5O2 species relative to ethylene glycol). The next column lists heats of formation for species, which can be calculated through simple isodesmic reactions.
The purpose of these gas-phase calculations is to use them as a reference for the binding energy calculations in the subsequent section. It is important to note the high instability of the OCH2CH2O species. While preceding studies that calculate the binding energy of this species on Pt(111) (19, 58) report much lower binding energies, it is probable that the specifications of their gas-phase calculations (which were not reported) allow for a more stable configuration.
3.2 Surface Adsorbed C2HxO2 Intermediates
The calculated structures of intermediates of ethylene glycol dehydrogenation on Pt(111) are shown in Figure 2. These images contain only the top layer of platinum atoms, along with the entire organic intermediate used in the periodic calculations. Further information on the energetic and structural properties of these intermediates is contained in Table 2. Energetic information in this table includes the energy of chemisorption of each species (Q) and the electronic energy of the intermediate plus excess hydrogen atoms adsorbed on separate slabs relative to ethylene glycol in a vacuum and a clean platinum slab (E − Eo).

aQ is the energy of adsorption of the lowest energy configuration of the adsorbate. E − Eo is the energy of the adsorbate plus excess hydrogens adsorbed on a separate slab, relative to gas-phase ethylene glycol and a clean slab. Bond lengths are written with respect to the atoms in the species’ name.
bIndicates a snap binding energy value for Q as that adsorbate is not stable in isolation.
cThe “bonding type” column shows the atom and bonding type to the surface. The number in the subscript denotes whether the first or second of that type of atom in the formula in the first column forms a bond with the metal. The letter in the subscript denotes binding to either a top site (t) or a bridge site (b).
In general, the binding energies reported in this work are consistent with available previously published numbers. (19, 58) However, as noted in the previous section, it is difficult to compare many of the available results as the gas-phase structures are not often reported. For example, Skoplyak et al. reported a binding energy of 61.0 kcal/mol for OCH2CH2O versus ours of 111.9 kcal/mol. The surface structures reported are very similar, so it is plausible that this difference is coming from the gas-phase structure. While the gas structure reported in this work is very unstable, it is the only structure that will converge on a solution for this particular species. For this reason, the electronic energies relative to a reference are reported, which give a metric of adsorbate stability independent of gas-phase calculations.
From this relative electronic energy (column 5, E − Eo, of Table 2), one can observe the most stable surface intermediate within each level of dehydrogenation. Upon loss of one hydrogen atom, the HOCH2CHOH species is 10.2 kcal/mol more stable than the HOCH2CH2O intermediate. This result is in agreement with recent studies of alcohol dehydrogenation on Pt(111) that find initial C−H bond scission to be thermodynamically favored over initial O−H bond scission. (23, 59) Proceeding to further levels of dehydrogenation, the most stable C2H4O2 adsorbate is the ethane-1,2-diol (HOCHCHOH) intermediate. Among the C2H3O2 species, the HOCHCOH intermediate is most stable. Hence, the pattern established among the first three dehydrogenation levels is that C−H bond cleavage produces more thermodynamically stable intermediates than O−H bond cleavage on Pt(111). Chen and co-workers concluded through the use of EELS that the initial O−H bond cleavage in ethylene glycol decomposition is kinetically important on Pt-based metals. (15, 18, 19) Thus, their result combined with this work would suggest that the pathway of ethylene glycol decomposition to CO and H2 does not necessarily proceed through the most thermodynamically favorable path.
The thermodynamic sink for the system is the HOCCO intermediate that, along with five adsorbed hydrogen atoms, is 33.6 kcal/mol more stable than ethylene glycol in the gas phase. Interestingly, Alcalá et al. found that in ethanol dehydrogenation, the ketenyl (CHCO) intermediate is the thermodynamic sink at 21 kcal/mol more stable than gas-phase ethanol. (59) Structurally, this ketenyl species is similar to the HOCCO intermediate, the only difference being the simple substitution of hydrogen in ketenyl for a hydroxyl group.
Lengths for all Pt−O, Pt−C, C−O, and C−C bonds in the intermediates are also listed in Table 2. For intermediates containing two of the same bond type, the distance listed is in order of connectivity of the species name listed in the first column of the Table 2. For example, for the species HOCH2CH2O, 2.42 Å is the length of the Pt−O bond for the oxygen in the alcohol group of the intermediate. 2.05 Å corresponds to the Pt−O bond involving the alkoxide oxygen.
As a method of analysis in the rest of this section, the intermediates are divided into two parts, each containing a C−O center. For example, ethylene glycol contains two −CH2OH parts (development of quantitative group descriptors based on this analysis is contained in section 4).
The binding energy of ethylene glycol on Pt(111) is 11.4 kcal/mol, which is in good agreement with previous calculations by Kandoi (13.1 kcal/mol). (58) Skoplyak et al. found ethylene glycol to have a very similar structure (bound through both oxygen atoms to top sites), yet a slightly lower binding energy of 4.2 kcal/mol. (19) Adsorbed ethylene glycol contains two −CH2OH fragments, each adsorbed through the oxygen atom of an alcohol group to a top site (see Figure 2A). Comparatively, the binding energy (11.4 kcal/mol) is about twice that of an adsorbed alcohol on Pt. For example, Greeley and Mavrikakis calculated the binding energy of methanol to be 7.6 kcal/mol, (22) and Alcalá et al. calculated the binding energy of ethanol to be 6.5 kcal/mol, (59) as well as the binding energy of acetone, n-propanol, and isopropanol to be 4.5, 4.3, and 6.0 kcal/mol, respectively. (60) Intuitively, this is a reasonable result given ethylene glycol is binding to the metal through two alcohol groups simultaneously.
Upon dehydrogenation through O−H scission, intermediates containing −CH2O fragments will bind to the metal through the oxygen of the alkoxide. As compared to the hydrogenated alcohol group, the Pt−O bond is shortened by 0.3−0.5 Å, indicating a stronger interaction with the surface. This notion is reflected in the increase in binding energy from ethylene glycol to HOCH2CH2O (29.5 kcal/mol increase). Upon dehydrogenation of the −CH2OH fragment through C−H scission, −CHOH fragments bind to a top site of the metal through the under-coordinated carbon atom. This Pt−C bond is of length 2.09 ± 0.02 Å. Interestingly, given two intermediates containing one equally hydrogenated −CHxOHy section, an intermediate containing a −CHOH fragment will always be 10−20 kcal/mol more stable than its −CH2O fragment counterpart. This pattern in stability is consistent among smaller oxygenates as well. Two examples to consider are the relative stability between 1-hydroxyethyl (CH3CHOH) and ethoxy (CH3CH2O) (adsorbed 1-hydroxyethyl is 15.8 kcal/mol more stable), (59) and between hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) and methoxy (CH3O) (adsorbed hydroxymethyl is 16.8 kcal more stable). (24)
Moving to further dehydrogenated species, scission of the C−H and O−H bonds of the fully hydrogenated alcohol leads to formation of an aldehyde, −CHO group. If bound to the surface, the carbonyl group will take on a di-σ configuration where the C and O atoms are bound with two adjacent platinum atoms. The C−O bond length for gas-phase ethylene glycol is 1.43 Å. At 1.38 Å long, the C−O bond of adsorbed glycolaldehyde can be considered a single bond. It is slightly shorter than the C−O bond in ethylene glycol due to ring strain of the four-member C−M−M−O ring. Another important observation is that the −CHO group will not always bind to the surface. In most cases where there is a carbon−metal bond, an opposite carbonyl group will come off the surface. This is the case for HOCHCHO, OCHCHO, and HOCCHO. Additionally, in some cases, for example, HOCHCHO, the oxygen of the carbonyl group will form a weak interaction with the surface. The Pt−O distance for this species is 2.40 Å, which is in the same range of the weak −OH interaction with the surface. The species OCCHO shows that the carbonyl group adjacent to a fully dehydrogenated −CO group will bind to the surface. This observation is also made for C3 species. (61)
From the original alcohol group, full dehydrogenation of the carbon results in a −COH group. For the ethylene glycol dehydrogenation intermediates, this group binds to bridge sites. It should be noted though, that for all −COH group containing intermediates calculated in this work, adsorption to the top site is within 0.15 eV less stable than the most stable structure on the bridge site. When considering the potential errors of these calculations (including neglecting zero-point energy or temperature corrections, errors in using the GGA, which have been estimated at around 0.2 eV, (62, 63) and possibly significant interactions with periodic cells), these two configurations can be considered isoenergetic. Furthermore, the next section of this work, in agreement with the work by Alcalá et al., (59) shows that 1-hydroxyethylidene (CH3COH) prefers to bind on a top site. Similarly, this energy is within 0.15 eV of the bridge binding mode for this molecule. On the other hand, Greeley and Mavrikakis reported that hydroxymethylene (CHOH) (which is the analogous species in methanol decomposition) prefers a bridge site. (23) From this information, along with the results of a parallel study on glycerol (C3H8O3) intermediates, (61) it appears that the binding of 1-hydroxyethylidene (CH3COH) on the top site is the exception rather than the rule.
Finally, full dehydrogenation of the C−O center results in a −CO group. This group binds through the carbon atom to a top site, and the C−O bond shortens to a length of 1.22 ± 0.02 Å. This bond can be considered a double bond given the calculated length of the C═O bond in gas-phase glycolaldehyde is 1.24 Å.
From the trends in structures and energetics of the calculations presented in this section, it is apparent that systematic patterns can be developed for quantitative prediction of properties of similar species to the C2HxO2 diols. The next section of this Article quantifies the groups described above and assigns group additive values to them for use in semiempirical predictive modeling.
4 Group Additivity for Oxygenates on Pt(111)
Group additive values are useful in several applications, most notably in obtaining an inexpensive first guess of mechanistic energetics. (36, 37) Results from the previous section elucidate patterns in binding configurations and stability among the C2HxO2 oxygenates. In this section, we use these patterns to develop quantitative groups analogous to those of Benson, (34) which can be used to predict properties of adsorbed alcohols and polyols. The first part of this section discusses the basis set of calculations used to derive these group values, and the second part analyzes the predictive use of the group contributions and adds second-order corrections to improve the predictive power of these group contributions.
4.1 Derivation of Oxygenate Group Contributions
From the information in section 3, it becomes apparent that the ethylene glycol dehydrogenation intermediates contain two groups that dictate their structural and energetic properties on the surface. The formation of groups centering around a single central atom (similar to the original groups formed by Benson (34)) is not possible, due to the inability to predict the interactions between the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom with the metal surface and the adjacent carbon atoms. Therefore, it is necessary to define larger groups, which include as a center, carbon−oxygen atom pairs. For each of these groups, the ligands of both C and O dictate the properties of the group. Similar work by Kua et al., for the derivation of group properties of adsorbed hydrocarbons, uses a few gas-phase species, hydrogen, and the metal slab as references to define the heat of formation (ΔHf,298) of all basis set species. (38) Our work uses ethanol (C2H5OH) and isopropyl alcohol (C3H7OH) as reference states (ΔHf,298 equals −56.0 and −65.19 kcal/mol, respectively (49)) and define the dehydrogenation of one methanol type branch by referencing these molecules in the gas phase, with hydrogen adsorbed on a separate slab. Once again, the ΔHf,298 of hydrogen adsorbed on platinum is taken to be −11.1 kcal/mol, in good agreement with previous DFT studies. (38, 59) The metal slab itself is assumed to have a ΔHf,298 equal to zero.
As mentioned above, molecules used to define the basis set of group contributions are the dehydrogenation intermediates of the oxygen and α-carbon of the ethanol (C2H5OH) and isopropyl alcohol (C3H7OH). The structures of these molecules are shown in Figure 3. Table 3 contains important energetic information including heat of adsorption (Q), zero-point energy correction to heat of adsorption (ΔZPE), ΔHf,298, and the vibrational frequencies associated with the intermediate.

aΔHf,298 values are derived from ethanol and isopropyl alcohol in the gas phase with excess hydrogen atoms adsorbed on separate slabs. The lowest two vibrational frequencies are calculated from the assumption that there are two frustrated translational degrees of freedom. Structures of these species are shown in Figure 3.
The high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) results of Skoplyak et al. (19) can be used to examine the accuracy of calculated vibrational frequencies. The vibrational frequencies for ethanol calculated in this study (shown in Table 3) agree well with the HREEL spectra presented by Skoplyak et al. While this work overestimates the frequency for the ν(OH) mode by about 10%, the rest of the spectra is in good agreement. The νas(CH3), νs(CH3), and ν(CH2) modes are calculated to be between 2940 and 3060 cm−1. Additionally, the νas(CCO) mode, which is generally used for determining a scaling factor, is calculated at 1063 cm−1. This agrees well with the peak seen at 1050 cm−1 by Skoplyak et al. (19)
The bridge adsorbed configuration is used for the 1-hydroxyethylidene (CH3COH) intermediate. As mentioned above, the top-site adsorbed configuration is slightly more stable. However, the purpose of these calculations is to use these groups for predictive tools for larger oxygenates. All C2 species with −COH branches in this work, and the C3 species with −COH branches calculated in a tangential study, (64) are bound to the bridge site. Furthermore, the difference in energy between the two different adsorption sites for CH3COH, and all of the other C2 and C3 oxygenates with the −COH branch, is less than 3 kcal/mol. So the use of the bridge site instead of the top site for this group has minimal impact on the final result.
From the information in Table 3, along with information on gas-phase group additive properties, (35) oxygenate group contributions can be derived that center around carbon−oxygen−metal interactions. Specifically, contributions from the [C−(C)(H3)] were subtracted from the energetics for the molecules in Table 3. Additionally, corrections for the weak interactions between the methyl groups and the metal were subtracted. Specifics of this correction will be addressed later. Final results of these group contributions are contained in Table 4. The notation describing the “[C−(C)(H3)]” group signifies a central carbon atom (the C not enclosed by parentheses), which has four ligands, three hydrogen atoms (shown as “H3” in parentheses), and one carbon atom (shown as “C” in parentheses).

The ΔHf,298 contributions are compatible with gas-phase group contributions. The entropic (S298) and specific heat (Cp) contributions must be used independently of gas-phase groups. This requirement stems from the incompatibility of degree of freedom assumptions between fully mobile gas-phase species and stationary surface species. Properties of some useful, nonmetal containing groups are shown in Table 4 and can be used for prediction of temperature-dependent properties of adsorbed oxygenates. These groups were derived from the vibrational frequencies in Table 3, along with the vibrational frequencies that we calculated for the following additional molecules adsorbed on Pt(111): ethyl (C2H5), n-propyl (C3H7), iso-propyl (C3H7), 1-butyl (C4H9), 2-butyl (C4H9), 2-hydroxyethyl (C2H4OH), 2,3-dihydroxypropyl (C3H7O2), and 3-hydroxypropyl (C3H6OH).
4.2 Application of Oxygenated Group Contributions
The observation that similar patterns are followed between the adsorption of C2HxO, C2HxO2, and C3HxO3 intermediates allows for the employment of specific rules to follow when using the group contributions presented in the proceeding section.
The following list outlines specific rules of the binding of oxygenated groups in dehydrogenated alcohols and polyols: (1) Species follow gas-phase bond order rules (H-1 bond, C-4 bonds, O-2 bonds). (a) O will bind to top sites. (b) C will bind to top sites if three ligands are present. (c) C will bind to bridge sites if two ligands are present.
(2) A weak O−M bond forms for hydroxyl groups if the connecting carbon is not bound to the metal. However, if a fully hydrogenated R−OH group is among three consecutive groups that bind to the metal, the alcohol group will come off the metal. This is the case for glycerol.
(3) Ketone and carbonyl groups will bind to the surface, creating four-membered M−C−O−M rings with the following exceptions: (a) For a carbonyl group, if the α-carbon bound to the metal, the unsaturated C−O group comes off the surface and forms a C═O double bond (e.g., see HOCHCHO, OCCHO, and HOCCHO). (b) If two adjacent C atoms in a molecule are bound to any metal site, and the C that would make three consecutive C−M bonds in the carbon backbone of the molecule is a carbonyl or ketone group, this group does not bind to the metal (similar to the behavior of alcohol groups described above).
(4) A hydrogen bond forms between the alcohol groups if two adjacent carbon−metal bonds form an M−C−C−M ring. This hydrogen bond occurs for the OH groups of adjacent C atoms bound at top sites, and also for OH groups of a nonbound C atom that has two neighboring C atoms bound to the surface and at least one is bound at a top site (i.e., for COHCHOHCHOH, the OH groups of the second and third C will have a hydrogen bond).
These rules guide the use of the groups in Table 4 for prediction of thermochemical properties of oxygenates. Additionally, second-order contributions can be added to increase the accuracy of predictions. Benson’s book on group additivity (34) outlines several higher-order corrections for group additivity including but not limited to steric hindrance from gauche interactions and ring strain.
Ring strain is discussed at length in both Benson’s book (34) and the work by Goddard and co-workers. (38) From the corrections for ring strain in Benson’s book, it is apparent that four-member rings contain much higher strain than five- or six-member rings. (34) For this reason, we include only corrections for four-member rings. There are two relevant four-member rings to this work, the C−M−M−C ring and the C−M−M−O ring. Corrections for the latter are implicit in the groups shown in Table 4. Goddard and co-workers calculate the C−M−M−C strain for M = Pt to be 2.2 kcal/mol. (38) This value is used herein.
With respect to ΔHf,298, for groups that are off the surface, gas-phase group contributions are used. There are still, however, weak interactions between these groups with the metal. To calculate this correction, we take the average distance of nonbound −CHxOH groups to the metal for the C2 chemistry set and calculate the interaction of CH3OH to the Pt(111) surface at that distance. The correction used for this work is −1.2 kcal/mol. Similarly, nonbound −CHx groups are corrected by −0.9 kcal/mol (this correction was derived identically using CH4). Formaldehyde (CH2O) is used as a probe molecule for nonbound carbonyl groups, and the respective correction is −2.1 kcal/mol.
The final second-order correction used in this work is hydrogen bonding. There are specific situations outlined above where hydrogen bonds form between adjacent alcohol groups. To quantify this effect, the alcohol groups in adsorbed ethen-1,2-diol (HOCHCHOH) were moved from opposite sides, into hydrogen-bonding position. The difference in these two configurations was 5.0 kcal/mol. This is taken to be the stabilization of hydrogen bonding.
From the information in Table 2, ΔHf,298 values for adsorbed C2HxO2 species on Pt(111) are calculated using ethylene glycol in the gas phase and hydrogen adsorbed on a separate slab as a reference (these values are not corrected for temperature or ZPE). Additionally, the heats of formation of several C3HxO3 species have been calculated using glycerol in the gas phase and hydrogen adsorbed on a separate slab as a reference. (61) These calculated heats of formation are compared to values obtained using the proposed group additivity method in Figure 5. There are very few exceptions to the rules presented above for the adsorption of C3HxO3 species. (61) It should also be noted that the configurations predicted for these outlying cases are within 5 kcal/mol of the most stable configuration calculated herein, and thus the proposed framework is adequate.
An example of applying this methodology details the ΔHf,298 calculation for the CHOCHOHCHOH species (shown in Figure 4). This adsorbate contains four groups. The two groups including bonds to the surface are the [C(C,H,M)−O(M)] and [C(C,H,M)−O(H)] groups. The [C(C,H,M)−O(M)] is outlined by dashed and dotted lines in Figure 4. The other two groups, [C−(C)2(H)(O)] and [O−(C)(H)], are not directly bound to the surface. The ΔHf,298 values of these four groups are −35.9, −54.8, −7.2, and −37.9 kcal/mol, respectively. There are two second-order corrections that need to be added to this calculation. The first is a −1.2 kcal/mol correction for the weak stabilizing interaction between the middle CO center and the surface. The second is a −5.0 kcal/mol correction for the hydrogen bond forming between the second and third hydroxyl groups. When summed, the group additive ΔHf,298 of CHOCHOHCHOH is −142.0 kcal/mol (obtained from ZPE and temperature corrected groups). Using the groups in Table 4, which are not corrected for ZPE or temperature, one gets a ΔHf,298 of −130.4 kcal/mol. This compares well with the uncorrected DFT value of −127.8 kcal/mol.

As shown in Figure 5, the proposed group additivity method is viable as a screening technique to identify trends in reaction intermediate stability. The group ΔHf,298 values used in this comparison are not corrected for temperature or ZPE effects (second column in Table 4). These values are used because the DFT values of C2 and C3 oxygenates presented are also not corrected for either temperature or ZPE effects. The R2 value for the parity graph in Figure 5 is 0.95.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Comparison of DFT calculated ΔHf,298 to values estimated from group additivity, for C2 and C3 polyols adsorbed on Pt(111). Groups used in this comparison are not corrected for either temperature effects or ZPE effects.
It is difficult to access the absolute error associated with the method, due to the errors present in the DFT values that are used as a metric. The errors in using the GGA for DFT calculations have been estimated at around 5 kcal/mol. (62, 63) To put this error in context, the DFT values in Figure 5 likely have even higher error associated with them due to the lack of ZPE correction and the potential coverage effects associated with using a 3 × 3 unit cell. While the agreement is better for the C2 polyols than the C3 polyols, it can be noted that the C3 DFT calculations were done at a slightly lower level of theory and were calculated in the same unit cell (3 × 3). This can cause an additional error in the C3 set from interactions between periodic cells. Both of these factors lead to higher errors associated with the DFT calculations for the C3 polyols, and thus to decreased accuracy in attempting to predict these values. Nevertheless, Figure 5 shows the ability of the group additivity method to adequately predict trends in stability of adsorbed C2 and C3 oxygenates.
5 Applying Linear Scaling Methods to C2HxO2 Oxygenates
In this section, we apply the linear scaling relationships developed by Nørskov and co-workers (43-45) to the ethylene glycol dehydrogenation intermediates previously presented, to estimate the binding energy of these species on the Ni(111) and Ni−Pt−Pt(111) surfaces. Figure 2 shows that many of these adsorbates bind to the surface through multiple atoms to different surface atoms. In this case, similar to the example of the di-σ bonding of ethylene in the work of Jones et al., (43) each bond to the surface is accounted for separately. Also, part of the basis of this method is that within the linear relationship, all surfaces will have the same y-intercept. (45) We take advantage of this common y-intercept by essentially setting it based on the value obtained from the calculation on platinum. That is, with the information from the calculations shown in section 3, the only information needed to scale the binding energy to a different surface is the slope of the line, and the distance moved in the x-direction (the difference in atomic binding energy). Each separate adsorbate−metal interaction is treated this way and then summed to equal the total binding energy of the adsorbate.
(5)
Equation 5 is used to estimate the binding energy of each adsorbate on the Ni(111) and Ni−Pt−Pt(111) surfaces. Here, QM is the binding energy of the species on the surface of interest, and QPt is the binding energy of the species on Pt(111). Including this term sets the y-intercept for each linear scaling relationship used in this equation. The next term determines the slope and x-distance for the linear scaling relationship used for each adsorbate.
QA,i,M represents the atomic binding energy (for atom A), on the site of interest (i = top, bridge, or hollow), for the metal surface of interest (M). Jones et al. determined that the use of atomic binding energy of the specific site where the adsorbate is positioned results in a more accurate prediction. (43)QA,i,Pt is the analogous atomic binding energy on Pt(111). Finally, γ(x) is determined by the number of ligands the atom directly adsorbed to the surface has.
(6)
In eq 6, xmax is the maximum number of ligands that the surface binding atom can contain (e.g., for carbon x = 4), and x is the number of ligands that the surface binding atom does contain. (45) The summation in eq 5 contains as many terms as adsorbate atoms bind with the surface. For example, the intermediate HOCHCH2O will have two such terms: one for the bond between C and a top metal site, and one for the bond between O and a top metal site.
The last terms (ΔEs and ΔEROH) are the second-order contributions to binding energy. ΔEs is the destabilization due to four-member ring strain relative to the four-member ring strain of the same adsorbate on Pt. This effect is a function of lattice constant, so it is only included for the Ni(111) surface, as Ni−Pt−Pt(111) is assumed to have the same lattice constant as Pt(111). ΔEROH is the weaker binding of the ROH group to the surface (i.e., the binding that is present for ethylene glycol). This binding energy cannot be expressed using the methodology established by Nørskov and co-workers, as within their original framework, this binding energy would be the same on all surfaces, that is, γ(x) = 0 for this binding mode. For this reason, we derive a linear relationship between the binding energy of methanol (CH3OH) and the atomic binding energy of oxygen.

Equation 7 expresses the difference in adsorption energy from the R−OH group (assumed to be the same as methanol) to the metal surface of interest as compared to the Pt(111) surface (ΔEROH). In this equation, QO,M is the atomic adsorption energy of oxygen (at the most stable site), and QO,Pt is the atomic adsorption energy of oxygen on Pt(111). The factor nROH corresponds to the number of these weak interactions between the alcohol group and the metal (e.g., ethylene glycol has two, glycolaldehyde has one, etc.). The DFT energies of adsorption of oxygen and methanol on six close packed metal surfaces were used to derive this relationship given literature values whenever available or DFT from this work (Pt, Ni, Co, Rh, (29) Cu, (65, 66) and Ni−Pt−Pt).
The quantification of ring strain in the ΔEs term only takes into account four-member rings, as Benson showed that the strain for four-member rings is substantially higher than that for five- or six-member rings. (34) This term consists of an empirical approximation that ring strain is a linear function of nearest neighbor distance of the bare metal surface. Realistically, the strain for these rings should be a functional form that allows for a minimum in energy, as a minimum in strain will be the transition point between a tightening strain versus a stretching strain of the adsorbate. However, in practice, this transition point requires a higher nearest neighbor distance than platinum offers, and it is out of the scope of this work to explore catalysts with much larger lattice constants than platinum.
(8)
Equation 8 is derived from a linear fit to points in Figure 6. In this equation, DM and DPt are the nearest neighbor distance (in Å) for the surface metal and platinum respectively, and nM−C−C−M and nM−C−O−M are the number of four-member rings involving carbon, oxygen, and the metal in the molecule. The resulting strain energy (ΔES) is in kcal/mol. Figure 6 is calculated from changing the x and y dimensions of the Pt unit cell (to vary the lattice constant of the metal) and calculating the binding energy of ethylene (C2H4) and formaldehyde (CH2O). The strain energy is isolated by subtracting the electronic effect of varying lattice constant on binding energy through the calculation of methyl (CH3) and hydroxyl (OH) at each condition. Each C−M and O−M bond in adsorbed C2H4 and CH2O should be linearly related to the C−M and O−M bonds in CH3 and OH. Therefore, we subtract the binding energy of CH3 and OH from the binding energy of CH2O and C2H4 for each C−M and O−M bond, respectively. We assume that the difference in this number from the original platinum system is due to only to ring strain.

Figure 6. Ring strain for M−C−C−M and M−C−O−M as a function of metal nearest neighbor distance for close packed surfaces. All values are relative to platinum. M−C−C−M and M−C−O−M rings were calculated from ethylene (C2H4) and formaldehyde (CH2O), respectively.
Figure 7 demonstrates the application of eq 5 through scaling the binding energies of the C2HxO2 intermediates from Pt(111) to Ni−Pt−Pt(111) and Ni(111). These parity graphs show that using the linear scaling methods to predict binding energies of larger oxygenate adsorbates that bind through multiple surface atoms is reasonable. Also, Figure 7A shows that these relationships work for bimetallic catalysts. The R2 value for these parity graphs is 0.97 for both Ni−Pt−Pt(111) and Ni(111). It should be noted that while the maximum difference between the prediction and the DFT value is about 10 kcal/mol in both cases, there is also error associated with the DFT numbers themselves.

6 Conclusions
Periodic DFT calculations were employed to study the dehydrogenation intermediates of ethylene glycol on the Pt(111) surface. In relation to gas-phase ethylene glycol and hydrogen adsorbed on a separate slab, the HOCCO intermediate is found to be the most stable of the C2HxO2 species. Additionally, C−H bond cleaving intermediates tend to be thermodynamically favored over O−H bond cleaving intermediates. Within this set of intermediates, structural and energetic patterns centering around the −CHxOHy branches of the adsorbates emerge that allow for the quantification of thermochemical properties based on group additive methods.
Dehydrogenation intermediates of ethanol and isopropyl alcohol are used to derive oxygenate group contributions, which can be used to predict the enthalpy, entropy, and specific heat of adsorbed oxygenates on platinum. Second-order corrections to this method including ring strain, weak nonbound group interactions with the metal, and hydrogen bonding are quantified to improve the predictive ability of this method. This group additivity scheme appears to predict accurately enough the binding of ethylene glycol and glycerol dehydrogenated intermediates on Pt.
Finally, the heats of adsorption of C2HxO2 species on Pt(111) are used, along with atomic binding energies, to predict the binding energies of these species on Ni(111) and Ni−Pt−Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces by extending previously derived linear scaling relations. Furthermore, corrections are added for the first time for ring strain and weak oxygen binding modes. This work demonstrates that these scaling relationships are useful in predicting stability trends on bimetallic surfaces and for larger oxygenates.
