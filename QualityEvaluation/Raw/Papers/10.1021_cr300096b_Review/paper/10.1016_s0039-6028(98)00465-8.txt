Kinetic study of CO oxidation on copper modified Pt(111)
Abstract
The kinetics of CO oxidation on Pt(111) modified with submonolayer copper adlayers were studied using mass spectrometry (MS) and photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). The submonolayer 2D copper adlayers were formed on approximately half of the Pt(111) crystal, by evaporating copper through a mask. More precisely, the article deals with the modifications of the hysteresis in the reaction rate compared to the hysteresis occurring under certain reaction conditions on pure Pt(111) when the CO pressure is cyclically varied. When copper was evaporated onto the Pt crystal, the kinetic phase transition between the high and low rate regimes shifted to higher CO pressures and the reaction rate increased. In addition, the CO pressure range in which bistability was observed became wider. Upon increasing the copper coverage, the shift showed a maximum at a coverage of 0.3 ML until at 0.7 ML no clear first-order transition in the reaction rate could be observed any more. The results suggest that the active site responsible for the increased activity lies at the copper–platinum bimetallic border sites.
1. Introduction
The catalysts of the chemical industry almost always contain several active species. Certain components influence the catalytic behavior of others. Innumerable explanations of this effect have been given in the scientific literature

. New effects are continuously being found, some of which probably involve new mechanisms. But there are still relatively few surface science studies aimed at investigating the interactions between different catalyst components. They generally concern promoting species atomically dispersed on the surface, solid solutions or new bulk phases formed by a solid-state reaction between components. Still rarer are those dealing with two different surface domains of different elemental compositions

. The present work is part of a group of investigations dealing with such systems composed of two parts of different composition. These are the 111 face of platinum, Pt(111), and adlayers of copper. In this series of investigations, the coverages by adlayers ranged from a small fraction of a monolayer up to one monolayer. The present work concerns submonolayer coverages.
The choice of the active metals in the catalyst and the reaction were dictated by several reasons, concerning both possible relevance of results to practical catalysis and their significance in surface science.
Platinum is used in a very large number of catalysts ranging from those used in hydrogenation of fine chemicals to the ones functioning in major processes in industry, for example reforming of petroleum fractions. More recently, platinum has emerged as one of the essential components in the catalysts used for purifying automobile exhaust gases. Its role is to fully oxidize unburned hydrocarbons and CO. Copper is also widely used in hydrogenation processes and plays an important role in oxidation reactions. Copper is frequently present in cheap catalysts used for eliminating pollutants (in particular CO) by oxidation. In combination with chromium, copper can be a good catalyst for CO exhaust elimination

[17]
. Although the present work is purely fundamental, the choice of the metals used (platinum and copper) in the catalytic system is such that the results obtained could potentially have some relevance to practical catalysis.
Considering only the surface science context, one reason for selecting platinum as one of the metals constituting the catalyst for our studies was that oxidation of CO on Pt has been extensively studied
18

. A wide range of behaviors is found, depending on the selected Pt face and the experimental conditions. Bistability and hysteresis, or oscillations, have been described and thoroughly studied. From the surface science point of view, the reason justifying the selection of the second metal was that vapor deposition of copper on platinum (111) has been investigated during the last years

. Copper has been shown to grow in a 2D growth mode on Pt(111) (the so-called Frank van der Merwe growth), as was demonstrated by both LEED and temperature programmed desorption measurements
[21]
. An even more convincing evidence for copper island growth was found by Holst et al., who used STM. This technique revealed copper islands on Pt(111) of 100–200 Å in size at a substrate temperature of 340 K and a copper coverage of 0.25 ML
[27]
. The starting material for the catalytic studies being already well-known, no further studies were necessary.
The specific choice of the 111 face of platinum, rather than another face, is dictated by the fact that the behavior of the Pt(111) surface in the CO oxidation is not too complex, in the sense that no oscillations but just bistabilities (hysteresis) can be observed. The new effects we hoped to observe would thus be easier to interpret. Bistabilities are usually very sensitive to perturbations of the various parameters. We therefore thought that there was some possibility of observing new effects, and reaching conclusions without too intricate interpretations. When Pt(111) is exposed to both oxygen and CO and the temperature and flow rate are kept constant, the reaction rate displays a hysteresis when the CO pressure is cyclically varied. Starting from a high CO pressure, the surface is covered with CO. Since CO is very closely packed on the surface, oxygen only seldom finds pairs of free adsorption sites to dissociatively adsorb. This results in a low reaction rate. On decreasing the CO pressure, leaving the other control parameters constant, a kinetic phase transition occurs as zones predominantly covered by oxygen appear on the surface. These zones, or islands, nucleate at certain points and spread out until the whole surface is covered with oxygen. The oxygen covered surface retains many single unoccupied adsorption sites, thus allowing CO to adsorb and react to CO2. This takes place at higher rates than on a CO covered surface. Increasing again the CO pressure, a sudden reaction rate drop (kinetic phase transition) is observed at a CO pressure higher than the transition caused by a CO decrease, thus re-establishing a regime of low reaction rate. This constitutes the hysteresis. Both kinetic phase transitions can be correlated to work function changes on the surface as recorded by photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM).
In the previous work using a Pt(111) surface partially covered with submonolayer quantities of Cu, emphasis was laid on the fact that Cu deposited on Pt(111) [denoted Cu/Pt(111)] could promote the establishment of a predominantly O covered surface more rapidly than pure Pt(111), and we compared the rates of progress of the reaction diffusion fronts on Cu/Pt(111) and Pt(111)
[28]
. The purpose of the present work is to compare phase transitions (transition of CO to O and O to CO coverage) on the two systems and to understand the adsorption behavior on both kinds of surface.
2. Experimental
The experiments were performed in a stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with devices for low energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), mass spectrometry (MS) and photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM). PEEM forms a magnified image of the surface due to contrasts in intensity of photoelectrons emitted from the surfaces irradiated by UV light
[29]
. The corresponding differences in the work function are due to the coverage by different adsorbed species, thus permitting us to distinguish between various areas of the surface (different metal composition, or coverage by CO or oxygen). A PEEM image therefore reflects the work function changes in the different parts of the observed field. The corresponding image was recorded on video with a CCD camera (25 Hz) and was used to correlate the observed phase transitions in the reaction rate with transition in the surface coverage.
The Pt(111) surface was cleaned by the standard procedure of repeated cycles of sputtering with Ar+, heating in oxygen and annealing. Deposition of Cu was accomplished by evaporating Cu from a resistively heated tungsten wire covered with Cu. The temperature of the Pt crystal during evaporation was 470 K. Previous work cited in the Introduction shows that no diffusion of Cu into the bulk occurs below 550 K. The Cu coverage was determined by measuring the photocurrent for different deposition times and using the already calibrated dependence of the work function on the Cu coverage, as given by Paffett et al.
[21]
. These measurements show that the photocurrent has a local minimum at 1 ML of Cu on Pt(111). This calibration yielded a value of 1.6×10−3 ML/s for the deposition flux in the standard conditions we used for evaporation. For the experiments reported here, half of the crystal was shaded with a shutter less than 1 mm away from the crystal. The PEEM device was pumped separately because the channel plates, used to obtain a laterally resolved image of the surface, could not operate at pressures above 10−5 mbar. The gas composition in the PEEM resembled the gas composition in front of the crystal where the PEEM tube was focused. Therefore, by putting a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) directly at the outlet of the PEEM, we had a reliable experimental set-up to carry out MS and PEEM measurements simultaneously. We focused our interest on the macroscopic results (rate of reaction) as gathered by this quadrupole mass spectrometer. It is worth noting that it was not possible to compare the absolute reaction rates. The reason is that we cleaned the crystal each time before evaporating a copper layer of different thickness. Due to this way of preparation, we were unable to evaporate copper on an area of exactly the same size because of the impossibility of positioning the shielding shutter in an absolutely identical way.
3. Results
In
Fig. 1
, a picture of a copper adlayer of 0.4 ML is shown after admission of first oxygen at 5.3×10−4 mbar and then CO at 2.7×10−6 mbar to the UHV chamber (pumping speed 50 l/s, temperature of the crystal 410 K). Platinum looks dark because it is predominantly covered with oxygen (the work function is increased compared to uncovered Pt). The copper modified area is also covered with oxygen. Previous experiments showed that a platinum surface partially covered with copper (contrary to pure copper) could exhibit two surface phases, as pure Pt does, namely an oxygen and CO covered phase, the PEEM contrast between the two phases being important

We carried out a number of CO pressure cycles with copper adlayers of different thickness. The time to complete one cycle was 30 min. Typical examples of plots vs. CO pressures of the reaction rates (a), the PEEM intensity on Pt (b), and copper (c), are presented in

Fig. 2

Fig. 2
.1c display the intensity changes (in the squares as indicated in
Fig. 1
) during the cycle on, respectively, the pure platinum area and the copper modified Pt. With respect to the hysteresis branch corresponding to increasing CO pressures, the transition in the rate of CO2 production takes place in two steps in all cases. The first step is always correlated to the change of brightness of pure Pt (
Fig. 2
.1b
Fig. 2
.2b
Fig. 2
.3b). The second step is not so clearly correlated with the behavior of the copper covered surface. This is not surprising in view of the fact that both Cu and Pt are accessible on this surface and taking into account the fact that the change in surface coverage in the oxidation of CO is initiated by nucleation processes which are very difficult to control. The baseline in the reaction is not horizontal any more in
Fig. 2
.2a
Fig. 2
.3a, but this does not influence the position of the transitions. At 0.6 ML, we can still recognize the existence of two steps in the variation of the reaction rate (
Fig. 2
.3a). The description of the intensity changes in the copper area is, however, more difficult due to the fact that these changes are extremely small (
Fig. 2
.3c).

in the copper–platinum and copper-free platinum region, respectively (410 K).
The width of the hysteresis or bistable region, as measured between the phase transitions, varied when the temperature was modified. To determine this width, transition points were taken in the middle of the kinetic phase transitions. These phase transition points can be illustrated by using the schemes shown in
Fig. 3
: scheme I (top) is for the behavior of pure Pt; and scheme II (bottom) for that of Cu/Pt samples. We can distinguish in scheme I the transition 1: from CO to O covered and 2: from O to CO covered, both on “pure” Pt(111). In scheme II, we see two additional transitions, namely 3, from O to CO on the Cu/Pt region and 4, from O to CO again on the Cu/Pt region. The circles in both schemes show schematically the points used to determine the transitions.

The variation of the width between two transition points (1 and 2 or 3 and 4) is shown in the correlation diagram of

in which the transition points measured at different CO/O2 pressure ratios (whereby pO2 was kept constant) are displayed as a function of the reciprocal temperature [pure Pt(111) and 0.2 ML Cu]. The lines fitted through these transition points converge almost exactly to a single point (a so-called cusp).

The influence of the copper coverage on the position of these transition points is indicated in
Fig. 5
. A maximum appears in the shift of the CO pressure at which the transition from the predominantly oxygen to the CO covered surface in the copper modified area takes place (full circles). This shift is small for very low coverages of copper and becomes larger for coverages in the 0.2–0.3 ML range. Above 0.3 ML the CO pressure at the transition point gradually shifts to lower values before it disappears completely at about 0.7 ML copper. There is also a shift for the transition from CO to oxygen covered side on Cu/Pt(111) (full squares).

4. Discussion
The basic question to answer is what causes the observed enhanced reactivity of the copper modified region, and more precisely the shift and broadening of the hysteresis showing an optimum at a certain coverage?
As already stated in the Introduction, copper forms 2D islands on Pt(111) as could be shown with STM by Holst et al.
[27]
. Based on this result, essentially three different sites can be recognized: (i) pure Pt sites which are not influenced by copper in any way; (ii) bimetallic border sites each consisting of a Pt atom near copper, Pt being logically supposed to behave differently as compared to pure platinum; (iii) pure copper adlayer sites. These three different sites are schematically depicted in

The most intuitive argument suggesting that the active site is in fact the second mentioned possibility, namely a bimetallic site at the copper platinum interface, goes in the following way. Under the reaction conditions used, we are well above the desorption temperature for CO on pure copper and even adlayers of copper on platinum
[31]
. Consequently, the oxygen coverage on copper must be high. If the total surface were covered with copper, the reaction rate would be low, which indeed was observed for a coverage of 1.2 ML (not described in this publication). On pure platinum the reaction rate is also relatively low when the pressures are those used during our measurements. In that case the catalyst surface is actually covered by CO (closely packed). In our interpretation the bimetallic border sites should be responsible for the enhanced reaction rate because they are the place where the CO covered platinum and oxygen covered copper adlayers meet, and the two reactants, namely CO and oxygen, are in close proximity to each other. Vook and Oral, who studied CO oxidation on Cu adlayers on Pd(111), came to the same conclusion for their system
[32]
. The reaction remains located at the Pt-oxidized Cu borders the whole time, because CO adsorbs on the border sites directly beside an oxygen covered copper site and thus reacts rapidly because of its proximity to an available oxygen. Carbon monoxide, whose diffusion on Pt is relatively fast, would migrate on the platinum surface towards the oxygen covered copper where it would be oxidized, thus allowing the process to continue. If this model is true, the CO pressure at which the transition from O covered to CO covered surface occurs would be higher for the Cu/Pt region than for the Pt region. More CO has to be in the gas flow to achieve a CO coverage high enough to induce the expansion of CO islands, finally covering the whole copper modified half of the platinum crystal.
This picture is only physical and does not explain how the two chemical species could react with each other. We have to propose more precise mechanisms to explain the promoting effect of copper. Altogether we have two basic options.
(1) The already mentioned bimetallic border sites. Here no electronic modification has taken place of Pt and Cu. Adding copper could be regarded as “just” increasing the local oxygen coverage at the borderline, this being equivalent to an oxygen pressure increase. This would indeed lead to a shift in the hysteresis, as can be seen in a Pt(111) pressure phase diagram
[33]
. However, in this description the question of the size of the broadening of the hysteresis remains to be answered.
(2) Electronic modifications. Several possibilities were mentioned in a paper by Mergler et al.
[34]
, who studied CO oxidation on a Pt/CoOx/SiO2 catalyst. Five alternative forms of modification of the adsorption/desorption properties can be recognized: (a) oxygen on copper; (b) oxygen on platinum; (c) CO on copper; (d) CO on platinum; (e) reaction on platinum. Let us examine these in succession in our case.
(a) The bond of oxygen to Cu could loosen. The whole reaction would then run on the Pt surface, whereby Oads would be supplied by migration of Oads from CuO1−x to Pt. It is, however, not clear then how O atoms can be removed from their Cu site. It is always assumed that oxygen prefers to bind to Cu above Pt. In addition, this hypothesis rests on the possible existence of an oxygen spillover, or, at least, a “jump” over a few atoms distance of oxygen. This would further imply that an oxygen island would be created on Pt(111) starting from the borderline, and this would spread out over the total surface. The consequence would be to trigger the high reaction rate on Pt. However, there would be no shift of the transition points (see scheme I and II) related to the reaction on Pt(111) on the lower branch of the hysteresis. An alternative could be that O2 is adsorbed on electronically modified Cuδ+ at the Cu/Pt borderline and would react with CO on Pt. This alternative is also possible for high coverages of CO on Pt.
(b) The interaction of Cu with Pt at the borderline could make the adsorption of oxygen on Pt stronger. In order to change the reaction rate, this effect should be more pronounced with oxygen than with CO adsorption. However, at low average experimental temperatures “all” Pt sites are covered by CO, also those adjacent to the Cu patches.
(c) We have already stated that, under our experimental conditions, we are well above the desorption temperature for CO on copper adlayers
[31]
. Since the copper adlayers are oxygen covered, a modification of the CO adsorption properties is not an option.
(d) Because of the electronic interaction, the bond of CO to the platinum atoms near to Cu could become weaker, thus providing more reactive CO species. It can be expected that these sites with weaker bonded CO molecules on platinum would manifest themselves in temperature desorption spectra. The reaction of CO with oxygen as studied here occurs on the catalyst surface where at least a part, if not all, of the Cu sites are covered by oxygen. Therefore, the most relevant CO–TPD data (from which conclusions are usually drawn on the variety of adsorption modes and the corresponding adsorption strength of these modes) should be those obtained for platinum surfaces modified with oxygen covered copper. Such data are, however, not available. Before CO could desorb it would react with the available oxygen. It is nevertheless of interest to look at the CO–TPD results obtained with Pt and Cu/Pt surfaces which are free of oxygen. The corresponding data show a site blocking effect, a phenomenon which we have not considered yet. Earlier investigations of CO desorption from copper modified Pt(111) showed, besides the desorption peak from pure platinum, an extra peak at lower desorption energies growing in the temperature desorption spectra with increasing copper coverages
21
,
22
. From a macroscopic point of view, this is not unexpected since the desorption temperature for CO on Cu(111) is lower than that for Pt(111). However, a CO desorption shoulder in addition to the main peak arose (at 337 K) in the case of submonolayer copper adlayers (0.18 ML). This was attributed to sites of platinum near to copper atoms. The position of the main desorption maximum of CO adsorbed on Pt(111) did not shift at increasing copper coverage, but the area of the desorption peak decreased in size. The conclusion was thus that this decrease in size was not due to a modification of the adsorption site, but rather to a site blocking mechanism
21
,
22
. This means that copper acts as a poison for the CO uptake. The number of sites available for CO adsorption decreases with increasing copper coverage. This is analogous to the results of Asakura and coworkers, who modified Pt(110) and Pt(100) with Au
8
,
9
,
35
. There is, however, a difference compared to our measurements, namely that the Au is relatively inert towards CO oxidation and more importantly that it is homogeneously distributed on platinum
[36]
. As mentioned above, Paffett et al. suggested that the copper evaporated on Pt(111) would undergo 2D island growth (Frank-van der Merwe growth), so that small copper patches would be formed.
Although no firm conclusion can be made, we cannot discard the hypothesis that the Cu–Pt bond at the borderline could weaken the CO–Pt bond.
(e) Not only the CO adsorption/desorption properties on platinum near copper could be altered, but also the surface reaction apparent activation energy.
The above discussion leads us to conclude that it is likely that the observed kinetic features on copper modified platinum can be due to the Pt–Cu bimetallic sites situated at the border between Cu/Pt(111) and Pt(111).
Let us assume that the main (or macroscopically main) factor governing the activation energies of the relevant steps (adsorption, desorption, surface reaction) is the degree of Cu coverage, ΘCu. In doing so, we want to stress that we ignore the fact that small copper islands are formed on the substrate surface and that this is possibly a factor of importance in addition to the site blocking effect of copper adlayers. In our approach, ΘCu may reflect both effects. To explain the overall tendency of the reactivity change with increasing copper coverage, we can look at
Fig. 4
. Since the slope of the curves in
Fig. 4
reflects the overall apparent activation energy, we can see that this is changed by the copper adlayer. This is in contrast to a study of CO oxidation on Rh(100), which did not detect any modification of the activation energy when copper was added; only the activity of the system was enhanced. This was explained by the fact that the reaction took place on free Rh sites and not on mixed-metal sites
[37]
. In our case, we did observe a change in the reaction rate, which constitutes an additional indication that we should focus on the mixed-metal sites, we tend to describe as bimetallic border sites. The apparent activation energies for the curves of
Fig. 4
are, respectively, 40 kJ/mol for the kinetic phase transition of CO to oxygen covered Pt and 28.7 kJ/mol for the same transition on Cu/Pt (0.2 ML) and 28 kJ/mol for oxygen to CO on Pt and 14 kJ/mol for Cu/Pt.
Looking at the pure platinum case, the upper curve of
Fig. 4
reflects the situation at the point of transition from an oxygen covered surface towards a CO covered one. When this occurs both oxygen and CO are present at the surface because the reactivity of that surface becomes high. Since this is the high reactivity state, the slope of the Arrhenius plot should reflect, or be an approximate measure of, the overall apparent activation energy of the reaction. If the slope becomes steeper this would indicate a tendency of the activation energy for the reaction to increase and vice versa. The lower curve can similarly be approximately associated to the CO desorption energy, since at a transition from a CO covered surface to an oxygen covered one, the oxygen coverage will be almost zero and the CO coverage high, and consequently, the CO desorption regime would be rate limiting. Again, if the CO desorption energy increases the factor Ea/RT will increase and therefore the slope of the line in
Fig. 4
.
Following this line of thinking, we can attempt to describe the general behavior observed, by altering an already existing CO oxidation model for the reaction kinetics based on the mean field approach (where no surface diffusion terms are incorporated)
[38]
. It must be recognized that, unfortunately, the mean field approach does not consider local differences. This cannot take account of the island formation in a meaningful way; only a better insight into the island size dependence on the overall coverage would permit this (because this would permit us to know the amounts of different physical sites as shown in
Fig. 6
and their dependence on the copper coverage). The mean field theory is used here only to illustrate how certain changes in the adsorption/desorption and reaction properties of the substrate catalyst can influence the overall picture, such as in
Fig. 2
.
The basic equation for the reaction rate (r) is:
(1)
In this equation, ΘCO and ΘO stand for CO and oxygen coverage, respectively, kr is the reaction constant depending on the temperature. The change of the oxygen and CO coverages is given by the following coupled differential equations:
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
The first equation consists of the adsorption rate of CO minus the desorption and reaction rates. ΘsCO is the maximum CO coverage, pCO is the CO pressure and kCOa, kCOd, kr are the constants for adsorption, desorption of CO and reaction. The second equation describes the variation of the oxygen coverage. ΘsO is the maximum oxygen coverage, pO2 is the oxygen pressure and kO2a is the constant for oxygen adsorption. Desorption of oxygen can be neglected at the temperatures used (kOd=0). s(O2) and s(CO) are the sticking probabilities for oxygen and CO, respectively. q is 2 in the case of Pt(111).
All constants k have the following general form where Ea is the corresponding activation energy:
(6)
As described above, the slopes of the curves in
Fig. 4
can be correlated to the activation energy for the reaction and the activation energy for CO desorption. It is thus reasonable to assume that the apparent activation energy on Pt(111) of both the CO desorption (kCOd) and the reaction (kr) change with the copper coverage, namely being functions of ΘCu:
(7)
(8)
(9)
(10)
In these equations Erea is the activation energy for the reaction and Edes that for desorption. When we now solve the new equations and plot the transition points, we obtain the plot in
Fig. 7
where the variable α has two different values. The ratio of the variables α and β indicates which of the activation energies is influenced more by copper. Let us assume that β is 1. An α larger than 1 would imply a strong dependence on the desorption energy and an α smaller than 1 means that the activation energy for the reaction is influenced more than the one for the CO desorption. The graph with α=2, where the change in Edes for CO is larger than the change in Erea, shows a shift in the hysteresis to higher CO pressures, but the hysteresis becomes smaller. The graph with α=0.5 defines a hysteresis region which becomes wider and changes to higher CO pressures, and therefore simulates the experiments better. There is, however, no optimum to be seen, this implies that another factor influences the position of the kinetic phase transition. The conclusion is that just taking into account the changes of the activation energies explains the shift and broadening, but not the existence of an optimum.

To construct a model which gives an optimum necessitates the hypothesis that the total (CO+O) coverage depends on the copper coverage. The TPD spectra have already illustrated that CO adsorption is blocked when copper is on the surface. Stated in a different way, the active surface of platinum diminishes when the concentration of Cu increases. However, to obtain an optimum the oxygen coverage must show a stronger dependence than the CO coverage. A possibility would be to add a new term γΘCu in analogy to the assumption of Asakura et al.
[8]
: ΘsCO=ΘsCO(1−γΘC) and ΘsO=ΘsO(1−ΘCu) (where γ is a number smaller than 1). Incorporating these terms in the model does not show the expected results. Therefore, one has to conclude that a more sophisticated model is needed to describe the behavior.
We started off the discussion with the question where to find the cause for the observed phenomena. The active sites are the bimetallic border sites in which mutual electronic interactions take place. When copper is added to the surface both the reaction activation energy as well as the CO desorption activation energy decrease at the bimetallic border sites. The desorption energy decreases faster with increasing copper coverage than the activation energy for the reaction, thus describing not only the observed shift in the bistable region but the broadening as well. Finally, it can be said that a combination of more factors has to be included to fully describe the effects. In
Fig. 8
a picture is shown of how it is possible to visualize the model for CO2 formation taking place at the copper/platinum interface.

5. Conclusions
Submonolayer copper adlayers on Pt(111) have a positive effect on the rate of CO oxidation. A simple increase of the available oxygen for reaction due to the oxygen covered copper patches is not sufficient to describe the observed phenomena. Part of the explanation of the enhanced activity can be found in the altered apparent activation energies on Pt due to a copper adlayer covered with oxygen.
