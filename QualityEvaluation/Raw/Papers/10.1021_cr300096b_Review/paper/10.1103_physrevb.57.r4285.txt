ABSTRACT
We present scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results of an ordered Cr/Pt surface alloy formed upon annealing 1.5–3 ML Cr/Pt(111) to 800 K. This alloy exhibits a nanoscale pattern with remarkable features: (i) it appears only along surface step edges; (ii) it forms a highly symmetric hexagonal network of one-atom-wide dislocation lines, with a unit-cell dimension of 17.3 Å; and (iii) the contrast in STM images is sensitive to the STM bias voltage, reflecting a strong local variation of the electronic structure due to the presence of a regular array of two-dimensional Cr clusters containing ten atoms.
