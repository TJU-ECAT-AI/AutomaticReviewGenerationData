Cyclohexene as a chemical probe of the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni(
) bimetallic surfaces
Abstract
The reactions of H2 and cyclohexene on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces were investigated using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). Hydrogen desorbs from Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces at temperatures approximately 40–50 K lower than the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. The reaction pathways of cyclohexene are also significantly modified on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces. On Ni(1 1 1), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition to produce benzene (c-C6H6), atomic C(a) and H2(g). HREELS results also reveal that cyclohexene (c-C6H10) is strongly bonded to the Ni(1 1 1) surface. However, when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface at coverages from 0.5 to 3 ML, a fraction of the cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation to produce cyclohexane (c-C6H12) at 237 K. HREELS results indicate that cyclohexene is more weakly bonded to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface, with the ν(CC) stretching frequency (∼1638 cm−1) and skeletal distortions (649 cm−1) still present at 200 K. When a submonolayer coverage (40–50% saturation) of hydrogen is pre-adsorbed on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces, the cyclohexene hydrogenation activity is enhanced by 10-fold, with a lower onset temperature of desorption of the cyclohexane product at ∼180 K.
1. Introduction
Bimetallic alloys provide a method of modifying metal catalysts to improve catalytic selectivity and activity. With regards to Pt-based bimetallic systems, various studies have concentrated on adding different metals such as Sn, Ni and Fe to Pt catalysts to increase selectivity or activity of reactions such as hydrogenation
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
. Adding other metals to Pt catalysts not only increases the catalytic activity and selectivity, but also has the potential for reducing the catalyst cost. To better understand the effects of the Pt–Ni bimetallic system from a fundamental level, this paper focuses on the cyclohexene reaction pathways that occur on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces. Because of the different reaction pathways, cyclohexene is an important probe molecule used to understand the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons
[4]
.
Our research has previously focused on studying the effect of Ni deposition on Pt(1 1 1). This paper focuses on understanding the properties of the reverse deposition conditions, i.e. depositing Pt on Ni(1 1 1). We have chosen to study the cyclohexene hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reaction pathways on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface, which have already been studied extensively on the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface
[5]
,
[6]
. By using a combination of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), we hope to better understand the reaction pathways of cyclohexene on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces. Furthermore, our group has recently found that subsurface Ni is critical in inducing the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of the 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface
[7]
,
[8]
. For example, upon deposition of Ni on Pt(1 1 1) at 600 K, a major fraction of Ni diffuses into the subsurface region, leading to a weaker metal–H bond and an enhanced hydrogenation activity
[7]
. The current Pt/Ni(1 1 1) study would provide further understanding regarding the role of subsurface Ni in the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) system.
2. Experimental
Two ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chambers were used in the current study. The chamber utilized for TPD and surface characterization is a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 1 × 10−10 Torr) equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and a mass spectrometer for temperature-programmed desorption experiments (TPD). For the TPD experiments, the Ni(1 1 1) sample was heated with a linear heating rate of 3 K/s. In addition, the opening of the random flux shield of the quadrupole mass spectrometer was placed at a distance of ∼5 mm from the sample surface. The experimental setup allowed us to monitor up to 12 masses simultaneously. The HREELS chamber is also a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 6 × 10−10 Torr) equipped with AES, a mass spectrometer for TPD, and an HREELS unit. This chamber is described elsewhere in detail
[9]
. For HREELS experiments, the Ni(1 1 1) sample (clean or Pt-modified) was heated to the specified temperature with a linear heating rate of 3 K/s, held for 5 s, then cooled to approximately 100 K to perform measurements. The temperatures were chosen on the basis of TPD experiments and of our previous study of the cyclohexene chemistry on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces
[6]
. Typical resolution of 40–60 cm−1 was obtained for all scans, using a 6 eV incident electron beam.
The Ni single-crystal sample was a (1 1 1) oriented, 1.5 mm thick Ni disk (99.999%), 8 mm in diameter. The crystal was spot welded directly to two tantalum posts that served as electrical connections for resistive heating, as well as thermal contacts for cooling with liquid nitrogen. With this mounting scheme, the temperature of the crystals could be varied between 90 and 1200 K. The crystal was cleaned with sputter/flash annealing cycles to 1000 K, followed by annealing at 1000 K. Surface cleanliness was monitored using AES.
Cyclohexene (c-C6H10), benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (c-C6H12) (Aldrich, 99+% purity) were purified by successive freeze-pump-thaw cycles prior to their use. The purity was verified in situ by mass spectrometry. Neon and hydrogen were all of research grade purity (99.999%) and were introduced into the UHV chamber without further purification. Doses are reported in Langmuirs (1 Langmuir (L)=1 × 10−6 Torr s) and are uncorrected for ion gauge sensitivities. Cyclohexene, benzene and cyclohexane dosings were performed with a crystal temperature of 110 K or below and by backfilling the chamber through leak valves. Hydrogen was dosed through a directional dosing tube, with a diameter of ∼8 mm. The directional dosing tube allowed a small dosage (0.5 L) to result in ∼40–50% saturation coverage of H2. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were stopped at 600 K because the diffusion of carbon into the bulk of Ni(1 1 1) started to occur at higher temperatures
[10]
.
The deposition of the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces was carried out with a crystal temperatures of 300 and 600 K, as noted in the figures. The TPD experiments were carried out on 600 K deposited surfaces to prevent background CO adsorption during deposition. During evaporation of Pt, the chamber pressure remained ∼5 × 10−10 Torr or below. The Pt deposition was checked for uniformity and cleanliness on the Ni(1 1 1) surface using AES, which revealed that the surface contained less than 1% impurities during Pt deposition. The coverage of Pt was estimated using the Pt (241 eV)/Ni (102 eV) AES ratio, assuming a uniform growth of the Pt overlayer.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of Pt/Ni(
) surfaces
The electronic and physical properties of the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) interface have been studied by various research groups in detail using AES
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
and LEED
[13]
. Deckers et al. found that Pt grows on Ni(1 1 1) in a disordered layer-by-layer method at room temperature. Annealing this surface to higher temperatures causes a Ni–Pt surface alloy to form, with possible Pt enrichment in the surface layer and Ni enrichment in the deeper layers
[13]
. LEED studies reveal a complex ordering of Pt films on the Ni(1 1 1) surface at temperatures above room temperature. At room temperature, a weak (1 × 1) pattern is seen
[13]
.
AES was also used in the current study to characterize the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces. Shown in
Fig. 1(a)
is the peak-to-peak intensity of the Pt (241 eV) and Ni (102 eV) AES features as a function of deposition time at a substrate temperature of 600 K. The Pt (241 eV) intensity steadily increases with time and the Ni (102 eV) peak decreases. However, this curve is not conclusive in showing that Pt grows in a layer-by-layer form or if it grows in simultaneous multilayers
[14]
. Assuming the formation of uniform Pt overlayers
[13]
, we have estimated an approximate monolayer of Pt would correspond to a Pt/Ni AES ratio of ∼0.8.
Fig. 1(b)
shows the effect of annealing different Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces to higher temperatures, from a deposition temperature of 300 K. In
Fig. 1(b)
, the initial increase in Pt/Ni AES ratio was most likely due to the desorption of trace amounts of CO and H2 from the surface. A detailed STM study would be necessary to rule out any changes in the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface morphology that might cause this initial increase in the Pt/Ni AES ratio. The Pt/Ni AES ratio begins to decrease at approximately 600 K and most of the Pt has diffused into the bulk of Ni(1 1 1) by temperatures around 1000 K.

3.2. Adsorption and desorption of H2
The desorption of hydrogen from a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface occurs in two separate peaks, at 270 and 354 K (shown in
Fig. 2
). When Pt is deposited on the surface at coverages as low as 0.5 ML Pt, the temperature at which hydrogen desorbs decreases to 234 K with a small shoulder appearing at ∼350 K. The peak temperature does not change significantly with the addition of Pt to the surface, up to 2.0 ML. Previous LEED studies indicate that a thick Pt film does not form an ordered (1 1 1) layer on Ni(1 1 1), possibly due to the lattice mismatch between the two metals
[13]
. Therefore, thicker layers of Pt on the Ni(1 1 1) will not likely have similar properties as the Pt(1 1 1) surface, which desorbs hydrogen at 280–290 K

The adsorption and dissociation of hydrogen are considered to be unactivated on most transition metal surfaces
[16]
. Assuming this is true for Ni(1 1 1) and Pt/Ni(1 1 1), the binding energy of hydrogen should be related to the desorption temperature of hydrogen
[17]
. Therefore, the lower desorption temperature of hydrogen on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces indicates that the metal–H bond is weaker on the bimetallic surface than on the pure Ni(1 1 1) surface or the pure Pt(1 1 1) surface. This weaker M–H bond has also been observed in Ni50Pt50(1 1 1) single-crystal alloys and in the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface
[5]
,
[15]
,
[18]
. In principle, this weaker metal–H bond should promote the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces, as discussed below.
3.3. Reactions of cyclohexene
3.3.1. TPD of cyclohexene reaction products on the Pt/Ni(
) surfaces
The three main reaction pathways of cyclohexene are dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and decomposition. On Ni(1 1 1), only the dehydrogenation and decomposition pathways are present.
Fig. 3
shows the desorption of cyclohexene and benzene as a function of cyclohexene coverage on Ni(1 1 1). At low coverages, the decomposition pathway is dominant, with only a small amount of benzene desorbing at 417 K. However, at higher coverages, a significant amount of benzene is produced as a broad peak ranging from ∼240–350 K, with an onset of desorption at approximately 200 K. At an exposure of 3 L, molecular desorption of cyclohexene starts to occur at 182 K.

shows the desorption of cyclohexene (82 amu), benzene (78 amu) and cyclohexane (84 amu) from a 3 L exposure of cyclohexene to Ni(1 1 1) and Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces with varying Pt coverages. The Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces exhibit different reactivities from that of clean Ni(1 1 1). At 0.5 ML Pt coverage, a small amount of cyclohexane is produced. Cyclohexene desorption also shifts to 220 K. Benzene is first produced in a sharp peak at 255 K, with a broad peak following, centered at 395 K. When more Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface (0.9 ML Pt), the cyclohexane production increases by twofold. At higher coverages of Pt, only slightly more cyclohexane is produced. The production of benzene only changes slightly, with the two separate desorption peaks expanding to form one broad peak at a Pt coverage of 3 ML.

The hydrogen production from the reaction of cyclohexene on Ni(1 1 1) and Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces is shown in
Fig. 5
. Both the dehydrogenation and decomposition reaction pathways contribute to the production of hydrogen on these surfaces. On the Ni(1 1 1) surface, the hydrogen product desorbs from the Ni(1 1 1) surface as two broad peaks, 366 and 432 K. On the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces, the hydrogen desorption occurs at temperatures lower than seen on Ni(1 1 1). With coverages of 0.45 ML Pt, the hydrogen desorption from the reaction of cyclohexene shifts to 309 K. Hydrogen desorbs from Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces, with coverages of Pt greater than 1 ML, at temperatures around ∼250 K. This relatively sharp peak of hydrogen desorption also resembles what was previously observed on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces

In order to quantify the TPD peak areas, we have performed TPD and AES measurements of benzene from an inert O/Ni(1 1 1) surface, shown in
Fig. 6
. Benzene desorbs from the O/Ni(1 1 1) surface at 250 K. AES spectra taken after the TPD experiment confirmed that the surface was inert because of the absence of carbon in the spectra. Also shown in
Fig. 6
is the desorption of benzene from the dehydrogenation reaction of cyclohexene on the Ni(1 1 1) surface. These spectra were used for the quantification of cyclohexene dehydrogenation on the Ni(1 1 1) surface, which will be discussed in detail in

3.3.2. HREELS of the surface intermediates on Ni(
) and Pt/Ni(
)
HREELS results following the reaction of cyclohexene on clean Ni(1 1 1) and the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces are described in this section. To provide a basis for comparison, we will first assign the vibrational spectra of cyclohexene on the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. Spectrum (a) in
Fig. 7
was recorded after the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface was exposed to a 10 L of cyclohexene, corresponding to multilayer adsorption of cyclohexene. Spectra 7(b)–(f) were obtained following the decomposition and dehydrogenation of 3 L cyclohexene on the Ni(1 1 1) surface. Peak assignments of cyclohexene adsorbed on the Ni(1 1 1) surface are listed in
Table 1
. The vibrational mode observed at 649 cm−1 in
Fig. 7(a)
is assigned to the characteristic C6 ring skeletal distortion
[19]
, indicating that some molecular cyclohexene rings are still intact for the 10 L exposure at 100 K. Additionally, the observation of the vibrational mode at 1650 cm−1, corresponding to the ν(CC) mode, confirms that some cyclohexene molecules are weakly adsorbed at the multilayer coverage. The 3 L exposure of cyclohexene to clean Ni(1 1 1) at 100 K, however, displays features consistent with the partial conversion of cyclohexene to benzene. For example, the γ(C–H) vibrational mode at 757 cm−1 is characteristic of the out-of-plane deformation mode of benzene
[20]
,
[21]
. As compared in
Table 2
, the vibrational features after heating to 200 K are very similar to those of benzene. Further heating to 250 and 300 K does not cause significant changes. The vibrational mode detected at 1712 cm−1 is attributed to CO accumulation from the UHV background chamber. After further heating to 450 K, only the γ(C–H) mode of 757 cm−1 remains, with an additional weak feature at 3619 cm−1 due to traces of contaminants of H2O.

. Unlike the 3 L exposure on the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface,
Fig. 8(a)
at 100 K displays a peak at 1638 cm−1, which is characteristic of the ν(CC) vibrational mode. The detection of the ν(CC) mode, along with a decrease in the intensity and sharpness of the 753 cm−1 benzene γ(C–H) mode, indicates that the conversion of cyclohexene to benzene occurs only partially at 100 K on the 0.4 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface. After heating to 200 K, the ν(CC) modes at 1638 cm−1 disappears while features relating to benzene at 753, 1117, and 1427 cm−1 sharpen. Further heating to 250 and 300 K produces no changes in the HREEL spectra. Finally, after heating to 450 K, only the γ(C–H) mode of 753 cm−1 remains with slight traces of contaminants of H2O at ∼3612 cm−1.

displays HREEL spectra of the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface after 3 L exposure of cyclohexene. The presence of the ν(CC) mode at 1617 cm−1 and the lack of the characteristic γ(C–H) mode (∼750 cm−1) indicate that the ∼1 ML Pt surface is even less active than the ∼0.4 ML Pt surface for the low-temperature conversion of cyclohexene to benzene. At 200 K, characteristic cyclohexene modes are still present, in contrast to the ∼0.4 ML Pt surface that showed the near complete conversion to benzene by 200 K. After heating to 250 K, the benzene γ(C–H) mode at 778 cm−1 is observed on the ∼1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface. Further heating to 300 K produces no changes from the 250 K spectra except an increase in the adsorbed CO peak at 1752 cm−1. Unlike the clean Ni(1 1 1) and the ∼0.4 ML Pt on Ni(1 1 1), heating to 450 K eliminated all vibrational modes from the spectra, including the γ(C–H) at 778 cm−1 that remained on the other two surfaces.
Finally,

shows the reaction of 3 L C6H10 on the ∼3 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface. Except for minor variations in the vibrational features, the spectroscopic development in

is rather similar to that observed on the ∼1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface (
Fig. 8
(b)). This is consistent with the TPD results of similar behavior between the 1 and 3 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces.

3.4. Effect of pre-adsorption of hydrogen on the cyclohexene activity
The effect of pre-adsorption of hydrogen on the cyclohexene activity on the 1.2 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface is shown in
Fig. 10
. The Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface was exposed to 0.5 L H2, which corresponds to approximately half of saturation coverage based on the TPD measurements. As a result of the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the surface, benzene does not desorb from the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface at 250 K. Only a broad benzene TPD peak, centered about 370 K is present, reducing the activity toward benzene formation by a factor of 1.7. In contrast, the cyclohexane production is significantly enhanced by the presence of hydrogen on the surface, with an increase in activity of about 10-fold based on TPD peak areas. In addition, only a relatively small increase in the hydrogen desorption is shown, indicating that most of the pre-adsorbed hydrogen is consumed in the hydrogenation reaction.

are similar to their counterparts of ∼1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) without the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen (
Fig. 8(b)
). The spectroscopic development is consistent with the presence of molecularly adsorbed cyclohexene at temperatures up to 200 K, which is converted to surface benzene at higher temperatures. The general similarity between

indicates that HREELS is less sensitive than TPD in detecting the effect of pre-adsorbed hydrogen for the subsequent hydrogenation of cyclohexene.

4. Discussion
4.1. Cyclohexene reaction pathways on the Pt/Ni(
) and Ni(
) surfaces
The activity and selectivity of the Ni(1 1 1) and 1.2 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces were quantified using the C/Ni AES atomic ratios after TPD experiments and the peak areas of H2, benzene and cyclohexane. The reaction pathways of cyclohexene on the two surfaces are summarized below:
Ni(1 1 1):
(1)
(2)
1.2 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1):
(3)
(4)
(5)
Using the C/Ni AES ratio on the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface after the TPD measurement, the value for (a) was calculated to be 0.058 ± 0.002 c-C6H10 molecules/Ni atom. The dehydrogenation activity was calculated by dosing benzene on an oxygen-pre-covered Ni(1 1 1) surface, as shown in
Fig. 6
. This surface was inert to benzene decomposition, and all of the benzene desorbed from the O/Ni(1 1 1) surface, which was verified by AES by the absence of atomic C after heating the surface to 600 K. A separate AES measurement was performed after dosing an identical exposure of benzene on O/Ni(1 1 1) at 100 K, which revealed a C/Ni ratio of 0.20. Therefore, the benzene peak area in the upper spectrum corresponds to 0.033 benzene molecules/Ni atom. By comparing the TPD areas of the two spectra in
Fig. 6
, the amount of benzene produced from the cyclohexene reaction (b) was calculated to be 0.025 ± 0.001 (3% error) c-C6H10 molecules/Ni atom, from Eq.
(6)
.
(6)
This value calculated for the Ni(1 1 1) surface was then used to determine the activity of benzene production on the 1.2 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface, as shown in Eq.
(7)
. The activity of benzene formation on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface (d) was found to be 0.027 ± 0.002 molecules/Ni atom.
(7)
The value for cyclohexane formation on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface was estimated using two methods. The first method used the value previously calculated for d (0.027 ± 0.002). The TPD area ratio of cyclohexane (c-C6H12) to benzene (C6H6) produced on 1.2 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) was used to calculate the cyclohexane yield (e). In this calculation, the mass spectrometer intensity ratio was measured to account for different sensitivity to c-C6H12 and C6H6. The mass spectrometer intensity ratio was determined to be 0.41 c-C6H12/C6H6 by taking into consideration the different ion gauge sensitivities for c-C6H12 (6.4) and C6H6 (5.9) and exposing the chamber to equal pressures c-C6H12 (6.4 × 10−8 Torr) and C6H6 (5.9 × 10−8 Torr). This method led to a cyclohexane activity (e) of 0.004 c-C6H10 molecules/Ni atom from Eq.
(8)
.
(8)
The cyclohexane activity was also calculated independent of the benzene and decomposition activities. To calculate e independently, cyclohexane was dosed on the Ni(1 1 1) surface at 100 K followed by TPD measurements. AES confirmed that no decomposition occurred. An identical exposure of cyclohexane was then dosed on Ni(1 1 1) and an AES measurement was taken at 100 K. The AES measurement showed a C/Ni ratio of 0.3. By comparing this peak area with that from the production of cyclohexane from the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface, the value (e) was estimated to be ∼0.003, which was similar to the first method of calculation, resulting in a final value of 0.0035 ± 0.001.
The final calculation was to determine the decomposition activity on the 1.2 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface. Since the values for a, b, d, and e have been calculated, Eq.
(9)
can be used to calculate the activity toward decomposition.

Using Eq.
(9)
, the value for the decomposition pathway on the 1.2 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface was calculated to be 0.024 ± 0.001 molecules/Ni atom. The activities and selectivities of the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface and the 1.2 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface are summarized in

compares the TPD spectra of c-C6H12 from the self-hydrogenation of c-C6H10 (bottom spectrum) and from the molecularly adsorbed c-C6H12 (top spectrum). The latter surface was prepared by exposing a 1.2 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface to c-C6H12 at 100 K. Unlike that reported on clean Pt(1 1 1)
[22]
, c-C6H12 molecules desorb molecularly without undergoing significant dissociation on 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1), as confirmed by the absence of any atomic carbon after the TPD measurements. The interaction of c-C6H12 on the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface, as compared to clean Pt(1 1 1)is weaker in two aspects: (1) the absence of the dissociation pathway on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) and (2) a lower desorption temperature on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) (at 209 K in
Fig. 6
(b)) than on clean Pt(1 1 1) (at 237 K
[22]
). The weaker interaction of c-C6H12 on the ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface is consistent with the weaker adsorption of hydrogen and cyclohexene reported in the current manuscript. In a previous publication we have correlated a shift of the d-band center away from the Fermi level to the weaker adsorption energies of Pt(1 1 1) surfaces with subsurface Ni atoms
[7]
. We will use similar argument here to explain the weaker interaction between adsorbates and the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface. Furthermore,
Fig. 6(b)
also reveals that the reversible molecular desorption of c-C6H12 occurs at a lower temperature (209 K) than that from the self-hydrogenation of c-C6H10 (237 K), suggesting that the desorption of the cyclohexane product on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) is a reaction-limited desorption process.
4.2. Comparison of Pt/Ni(
) with Ni/Pt(
)
Overall, the TPD and HREELS experiments demonstrate a distinct difference between the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces and the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface for the reaction pathways of cyclohexene. Possible explanations for the reactivity of the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces include the presence of a weaker metal–H bond, as well as the presence of a more weakly bonded cyclohexene as detected in the HREELS experiments. The TPD experiments show that a weak metal–H bond exists only on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces. In addition, the HREELS experiments show that the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface dehydrogenates cyclohexene to produce benzene at temperatures as low as 100 K. In contrast, the Pt-modified Ni(1 1 1) surfaces only partially dehydrogenate the cyclohexene molecules. Therefore, molecularly adsorbed cyclohexene intermediates are present on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface at ∼200 K which can undergo hydrogenation to form cyclohexane starting at 200 K. Furthermore, the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) significantly increases the production of cyclohexane, confirming the importance of the weakly bonded hydrogen in the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene.
As mentioned previously, the cyclohexene chemistry of the 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface has also been studied
[6]
. The remarkable similarity between the 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface and the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface indicates that the two surfaces have similar physical and electronic structures. Both surfaces desorb hydrogen at approximately 250 K, with the production of cyclohexene also occurring at ∼230–250 K
[8]
. The peak shape and desorption temperature of the benzene product are also very similar on both surfaces. A previous scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) and density functional theory study (DFT) showed that most of the Ni in the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface does not remain on the surface when the Pt(1 1 1) crystal temperature is 600 K
[7]
. The segregation energies of Ni in Pt also suggest that Ni prefers to diffuse into Pt(1 1 1)
[23]
. Studies of Ni/Pt alloy surfaces also show that the surface layer is Pt-enriched and the second layer is Ni-enriched
[18]
,
[24]
. Therefore, both the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) and 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces should have a Pt-enrichment in the top-most layer, leading to the similar activities of the two surfaces. Additionally, the combination of the study on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and the current study on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) indicates that the presence of subsurface Ni is most likely responsible for the novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity on 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1).
Finally, the 3 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface shows similar activities to those of the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface. The low-temperature desorption of H2 and hydrogenation of cyclohexene are not detected in pure Pt(1 1 1), indicating that the 3 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface is distinctly different from Pt(1 1 1). This is in contrast to our early study of Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, where a 3 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface shows nearly identical activities to those of Ni(1 1 1). The 3 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface likely does not act like a pure Pt(1 1 1) surface because the Pt film is strained and does not form an ordered Pt(1 1 1) structure
[13]
. The different activities of the 3 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) and 3 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, using ethylene and cyclohexene as probe molecules have been compared in detail in reference

5. Conclusion
The results in this paper demonstrate the effect of depositing Pt on Ni(1 1 1) on the activity and selectivity of cyclohexene reaction pathways. Cyclohexene decomposes to C(a) and H2 and dehydrogenates to benzene on a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. However, when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface, a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway is introduced. Cyclohexane is produced at 237 K on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces with coverages of 0.5 ML Pt and higher. HREELS also reveal that cyclohexene bonds more weakly to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface than to Ni(1 1 1). In addition, the pre-adsorption of H2 on the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface enhances the hydrogenation activity. The combination of HREELS and TPD show that the low-temperature hydrogenation is a result of the weakly-bonded hydrogen and cyclohexene on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces.
