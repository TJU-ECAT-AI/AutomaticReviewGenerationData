Abstract
The reasons and nature of the deactivation of spinel-supported bimetallic Pt–Sn, Pt–In, and Pt–Cu catalysts in the steam dehydrogenation of C4–C5paraffins are analyzed. The deactivation can be reversible and irreversible. Reversible deactivation is associated with the effects of the composition of reaction medium and gaseous medium for preliminary treatment on the surface composition of supported bimetallic alloys and with the coking of catalysts. Irreversible deactivation can result from the irreproducibility of the phase composition and dispersion of supported alloys in dehydrogenation–regeneration cycles and from the carbon erosion of catalysts. This erosion consists in the removal of active metal particles to the bulk of carbon deposits. The formation of carbon deposits on the surfaces of spinel supports and bimetallic catalysts is considered. Recommendations for optimizing the composition and the operating conditions of catalysts are given in order to reduce the effects of factors that result in reversible and irreversible deactivation.
