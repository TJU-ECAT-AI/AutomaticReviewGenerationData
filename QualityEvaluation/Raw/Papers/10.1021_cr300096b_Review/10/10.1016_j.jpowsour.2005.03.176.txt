Abstract
Catalytic autothermal reforming (ATR) of synthetic diesel and JP8 over supported metal catalysts has been investigated in the present
study. Bimetallic catalysts exhibited superior performance compared to the commercial catalyst and the monometallic counterparts. BET,
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and XPS were utilized for characterizing these for-
mulations, which showed that the enhanced stability is due to a strong metal–metal and metal–support interaction in the catalyst.

1. Introduction
The reforming of higher hydrocarbons (e.g. gasoline or
diesel) for fuel cell hydrogen is a challenging proposition
not only because of sulfur problems but also because coking
problems can be severe [1]. Therefore, the successful reform-
ing of these fuels will largely depend on the development of a
catalyst, which is resistant to both sulfur and coking. In order
to avoid storing high-pressure hydrogen, the fuel can be gen-
erated in an onboard fuel processor [2,3]. For transportation
applications, the primary focus is on reforming gasoline be-
cause the production and distribution infrastructure already
exists [4,5]. For auxiliary power units, the focus is on reform-
ing both gasoline (for automotive applications [6]) and diesel
(for trucks and heavy-duty vehicles [7]). For portable power
generation, the focus has been on reforming natural gas and
liquiﬁed petroleum gas.
The conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to H2 can be carried
out by several catalytic reaction processes, including steam

reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX) and autothermal re-
forming (ATR). ATR involves the reaction of oxygen, steam
and fuel to produce H2 and CO2. In essence, this process can
be viewed as a combination of POX and SR and provides
higher energy efﬁciency than the above processes [8].
The design of ATR catalysts can be challenging, partic-
ularly for gasoline/diesel reforming due to the complex and
ill-deﬁned nature of the fuel. ATR catalysts have to be active
for both steam reforming and partial oxidation, be resistant
to high temperatures and tolerant against sulfur poison and
coke formation, especially in the catalytic zone with inade-
quate oxygen concentration.
Catalyst formulations for ATR fuel processors depend on
the fuel choice and operating temperature. For methanol, Cu-
based formulations can be used [9]. The catalysts based on
the noble metals seem to be more active for the ATR re-
action than the Ni-based ones [10,11]. Kikuchi et al. [12]
studied the methane steam reforming reaction and they have
demonstrated that the reactivity of different supported met-
als on SiO2 follows this relative order: Ru, Rh > Ni > Ir > Pd,
Pt > Co, Fe.
A method for developing a noble metal catalyst of im-
proved resistance to sulfur compounds has been claimed [13].
The catalytic composition is obtained by subjecting the cata-
lyst containing a noble metal from group VIII or a compound

thereof, a halogen and a carrier. For higher hydrocarbons, the
catalyst typically comprises of metals such as Pt, Rh, Ru and
Ni deposited or incorporated into carefully engineered oxide
supports such as ceria-containing oxides [14].
Currentinterestinbimetalliccatalystsisincreasing,inpar-
ticular because they show superior selectivity and resistance
to poisoning as well as improved activity and stability. The
main objective of the present work was to determine whether
the autothermal reforming activity of Pt can be improved
when a second metal is added to the substrate.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.1.1. Ceria-based catalysts
The CeO2 support material has a purity of 99.9%. The
metal originates from a nitrate-based precursor material.
Each catalyst was prepared by the incipient wetness method
using distilled water as the solvent for the precursor materi-
als. The catalysts were then dried in air at 110 ◦C overnight.
Each catalyst was also calcined in air at 300–500 ◦C for
4 h. Bimetallic catalysts were prepared by depositing a metal
ﬁrst, drying, calcining and then depositing the second metal
with subsequent drying and re-calcination. The overall con-
centration of the noble metal was maintained at a value
of 1.25 wt.%
2.1.2. Alumina-based catalysts
The support material is Al2O3 (acidic, gamma). The ac-
tive metal sites were obtained from nitrate precursors. The
preparation technique adopted was incipient wetness method
using distilled water as the solvent for the precursor mate-
rials. The catalyst was then dried in air at 110 ◦C overnight
followed by calcination in air at 400 ◦C for 3 h. The catalyst
was then reduced in a mixture of 5% H2 and N2 for 1 h at
350 ◦C. Bimetallic catalysts were prepared according to the
procedure described above. The catalyst was then reduced in
a mixture of 5% H2 and N2 for 1 h at 350 ◦C.
2.2. Reactor system
All the experiments were performed in a 3/8 in. adiabatic
ﬁxed-bed tubular (quartz) reactor. The synthetic diesel fuel
(<10 ppm sulfur) and JP8 fuel (∼1000 ppm sulfur) were sup-
plied by South West Research Institute (SWRI) and were not
treated further. In case of a complex multi-component (>100)
fuel like diesel, it is difﬁcult to obtain a complete chemi-
cal breakdown. Conversely, from the elemental analysis (C:
83.92 wt.%, H: 14.66 wt.% and O: 1.42 wt.%) of the synthetic
diesel, the average chemical composition of the experimen-
tal fuel was calculated. Liquid feed consisting of water and
diesel was vaporized and mixed along with air in a pre-heater
containing silicon carbide bed to enhance mixing. Calibrated
HPLCpumpsandunitmassﬂowcontrollerswereusedtocon-
trol the ﬂow rates. The gaseous mixture from the pre-heater
was maintained at a temperature of 400 ◦C. The reactor with
the catalyst bed was well insulated with 2 in. thick refractory
ceramic ﬁber blanket to prevent heat loss and achieve the
adiabatic reaction conditions. The hot-product gas leaving
the reactor was cooled down in a heat exchanger/condenser
system to separate water and liquid hydrocarbons from the
product gas. Pressures above 2 psig were not encountered.
The dry-product gas from the condenser was analyzed us-
ing a SRI gas chromatograph to monitor H2, CO, CO2, CH4
and O2 concentrations. In each test, 2 g of fresh non-diluted
catalyst sample (pellets with an average size of 2 mm) was
supported on a layer of quartz wool.
The experiments reported in this document were per-
formed under the following conditions: H2O/C ratio = 2.5,
O2/C ratio = 0.5, pre-heater/reactor temperature = 400 ◦C,
gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) = 17,000 h−1. These con-
ditionswerechosenaccordingtoourearlierworkonsynthetic
diesel and JP8 fuel [15]. Oxygen was never observed in the
efﬂuent during any of the experiments at any of the tempera-
tures tested. Condensate from the reactor was considered as
unconverted/reformulated hydrocarbon. The carbon material
balance from preliminary experiments showed about 14%
loss, which can be attributed to unconverted hydrocarbon
condensate, coke deposition on the catalytic surface and/or
analytical error. Hydrogen yield deﬁned in the experiments
is the ratio of hydrogen in the products to that in the reactants
(diesel + water). The measured temperature inside the reactor
increased rapidly as the feed stream at 400 ◦C approach the
surface of the catalytic bed and then gradually decreased from
peak temperature of 800–365 ◦C down the catalytic bed, as
noticed in our earlier work [15]. The average product compo-
sition at these reaction conditions was typically in the range
of 55–60% H2, 1–4% CO, 39–43% CO2 and <1% CH4 [15].
2.3. BET (surface area) and CO chemisorption
(dispersion) measurements
BET surface area of the catalysts was analyzed by nitro-
gen adsorption–desorption technique. CO chemisorption at
−80 ◦C was utilized to measure the dispersion of these cata-
lysts using the pulse technique, this method is known to avoid
to some extent the spillover phenomenon which affects ac-
curacy of the data [16].
2.4. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)
experiments
Temperature-programmed reduction was performed in a
U-tube quartz reactor using a CHEMBET 3000 apparatus
manufactured by Quantachrome, provided with thermal con-
ductivity detector (TCD). Pellets (∼0.4 g) or ﬁne powder
(∼0.25 g) was used. To remove any water and CO2 adsorbed
on the surface, the catalysts were preheated to 250 ◦C for 2 h
followed by purging and cooling in helium. Then, a reduc-
ing gas mixture consisting of 5% H2 in helium was passed

159
through the catalyst and the temperature was ramped from
25 to 800 ◦C at a heating rate of 20 ◦C min−1.
2.5. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)
experiments
TPD of catalysts was carried out in the CHEMBET appa-
ratus described above. In all the TPD experiments, the cat-
alysts were preheated to 300 ◦C in helium for 1 h to remove
residual H2O and CO2. After cooling down to room temper-
ature in helium, the TPD data were acquired with a heating
rate of 20 ◦C min−1 to 600 ◦C. The ﬂow rate of the gas was
typically 70 cm3 min−1.
2.6. XPS studies
XPS data were obtained using a Kratos Axis 165 with an
Al anode as the X-ray source.
3. Results and discussion
The role of defect chemistry and the surface oxygen
vacancies in determining the catalytic behavior of supported
metal oxide systems is well known. The focus of this study
was on the autothermal reforming activity of these catalysts
as well as the effect and role of both the metal and the
dopant on the catalytic properties. The experimental work
involved developing, testing and characterizing: (a) single
metal catalysts supported on reducible or non-reducible
support and (b) bimetallic catalysts dispersed on these
supports. Reactor studies involved the reforming of synthetic
diesel fuel. Metal loadings generally range from 1 to 2%
in the case of noble metals and 5–10% for non-noble
metals.
3.1. Alumina-supported bimetallic catalysts
Three model catalysts were prepared to study the ATR ac-
tivity of synthetic diesel fuel: Pt, Pd and Pt-Pd catalysts sup-
ported on alumina. Also, two different bimetallic catalysts
were prepared by changing the order of impregnation: Pt(I)-
Pd(II) and Pd(I)-Pt(II). The metal content and BET surface
area of these catalysts is presented in Table 1. The surface area
values evaluated from the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms clearly indicate a decrease in the sorption capac-

ity of the alumina support after Pt and/or Pd incorporation.
As expected, the BET surface areas of the calcined catalysts
were lower than that of the support and decreased further for
the bimetallic catalysts.
The autothermal reforming activity of these catalysts is
shown in Fig. 1. Before carrying out the activity tests, all
the catalysts were reduced at 350 ◦C in a 5% H2/N2 mixture.
Catalysts loaded with Pt or Pd yielded about 50% hydrogen
compared to 45% from bare alumina. The most interesting
results are obtained from the bimetallic Pt-Pd catalysts.
Each bimetallic catalyst showed high activity yielding
∼60% hydrogen compared to 50% from their monometallic
counterparts. The order of impregnation had no impact on
the performance of these catalysts. The ATR activity on the
Pt, Pd and Pt-Pd catalysts conﬁrms a positive effect of Pt
and Pd in the bimetallic catalyst because the level of activity
of this system was higher than on either of the monometallic
components in spite of ﬁxed dispersion of the total active
component.
Gaseous product distribution obtained after ATR of
synthetic diesel fuel over alumina-supported Pd and/or
Pt catalysts showed a decrease in the lower hydrocarbon
(C2–C6) concentration by impregnating Pt or Pd on bare
alumina. More dramatic results were obtained over the
bimetallic catalysts yielding more hydrogen due to sig-
niﬁcant decrease in the lower hydrocarbon concentration
coupled with improved CO oxidation activity resulting in
lower concentration of undesired CO.
This higher intrinsic activity is probably due to the Pt–Pd
interaction in the system. Temperature-programmed reduc-
tion studies and XPS analysis were carried out to understand
this phenomenon.
TPR proﬁles of monometallic Pd (PdA), Pt (PtA) and the
bimetallic (PtPdA) catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. TPR pattern
of alumina carrier is not shown because of its non-reducible
nature.
The TPR proﬁle (Fig. 2) of the Pd catalyst shows a
negative peak at 75 ◦C followed by a positive peak at 110 ◦C.
The former can be assigned to desorption of hydrogen from
the decomposition of a bulk palladium hydride formed
through H-diffusion in to the Pd-crystallites [17], while the
latter is attributed to the Pd oxide species. In contrast, the

H2 in He.
TPR proﬁle of the Pt catalyst shows a broad reduction proﬁle
extending from 50 to 450 ◦C. All platinum oxide is reduced
to Pt metal below 450 ◦C. Two reduction peaks, one at 100 ◦C
and the other at 250 ◦C, were observed for Pt/Al2O3. The
broadening suggests the presence of several Pt species with
different oxidation states. These reduction peaks are slightly
lower than the reported reduction temperature [18] probably
due to differences in Pt content, calcination temperature,
alumina type and temperature ramp rate during the TPR
analysis.
The TPR proﬁle of the bimetallic Pt-Pd catalyst is not
simply the sum of the monometallic Pt and Pd catalysts.
The bimetallic reduction proﬁle exhibits peaks typical of PtO
(100 ◦C) and PdO (110 ◦C) in addition to the Pd hydride de-
composition peak at 75 ◦C, although both are much more
intense than in the monometallic catalysts. Since the metal
content is about the same in these catalysts, the increase in H2
consumption associated with the metal oxide species seems
to depend on the presence of second metal. In addition, the
broader second peak centered at 400 ◦C detected in the Pt-Pd
catalyst indicates the reduction of Pd species together with
the co-impregnated Pt, probably due to some kind of inter-
action between the metals. Similar interactions in Pt-Pd sys-
tems were reported in TPR studies performed by Noronha
[18]. These interactions between the metals leading to the
formation of an active phase seem to be a probable reason
behind the activity enhancement.
Signiﬁcant differences were also observed in the XPS
spectra of the Pt and/or Pd catalysts supported on alumina.
A slight shift in the Pd 3d5/2 peak (∼0.5 eV to higher bind-
ing energy) of the Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalyst with respect to that
of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was observed (not shown). The ob-
served differences on the supported Pd and Pt-Pd surfaces
may be due to the oxidation of Pd on the surface [19]. This
positive shift may arise from changes in the electronic relax-
ation energy of Pd levels (220) in the presence of platinum,
as suggested by Dufaux and Naccache [20].

3.2. Ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts
As a part of fundamental study to identify the role of met-
als and metal oxides in autothermal reforming reactions, ac-
tivity of bimetallic catalysts supported on a reducible ceria
substrate was studied.
Three different metals viz. Pt, Pd and Ni were chosen
for their ATR activity. These metals were chosen since it is
generally accepted that Pt/Pd and Ni are the most preferred
catalysts for oxidation and steam reforming, respectively.
Hence, the presence of these active metals on the same sup-
port can facilitate heat transfer between exothermic oxidation
and endothermic steam reforming at the micro scale, which
allows advanced heat management and thermally efﬁcient
hydrogen production. The ceria-supported catalysts include
monometallic components and their combinations with Pt: Pt
(1.25 wt.%)-Ni (5 wt.%) and Pt (1 wt.%)-Pd (0.25 wt.%).
Two different bimetallic catalysts were also prepared by
changing the order of impregnation on ceria substrate. It can
be noted from Figs. 3 and 4 that all of these metals improved
the ATR activity of ceria support. Similar to the results ob-
served over the alumina-supported catalysts discussed in Sec-
tion 3.1, the selectivity to produce hydrogen from diesel fuel
was highest for the bimetallic catalysts compared to their
monometallic counterparts. The impregnation order clearly
had an effect on the activity in case of both bimetallic cata-
lysts, as can be seen in Figs. 3 and 4.

for the autothermal reforming of synthetic diesel fuel ∼10 ppm S and JP8
∼1000 ppm S at H2O/O2/C ratio of 2.5/0.5/1 and reactor temperature of
400 ◦C.
The higher level of activities observed over the bimetallic
catalysts was further studied by introducing sulfur-containing
feeds in to the ATR feed stream. This was achieved by test-
ing the activity of these catalysts for reforming JP8 fuel.
As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, signiﬁcant loss in activity was
observed over the Pt catalyst during ATR of JP8 fuel for
more than 50 h. Similar experiments were carried out on
the bimetallic catalysts and the results are presented in
Figs. 5 and 6. The synthetic diesel is virtually sulfur-free
whereas the JP8 has ∼1000 ppmw S. It is clear from these
plots that both the catalysts (Pt-Ni and Pt-Pd) exhibit resis-
tance to sulfur poisoning in contrast to the activity decay
observed over the monometallic Pt catalyst. Stable activity
was observed over these catalysts even after testing them for
more than 50 h in presence of signiﬁcant amount of sulfur
poison in the feed stream.
Higher intrinsic activity and sulfur tolerance of the
bimetallic catalysts was further studied by conducting surface
characterization studies in order to explain the phenomenon
involved in the improved performance and the results are pre-
sented below.

3.3. Characterization of Pt and/or Ni catalysts
The TPR data sets obtained from the ceria-supported Pt
and/or Ni catalysts are portrayed in Fig. 7. The formation
of two peaks centered at 250 and 450 ◦C in the Ni catalyst is
due to the reduction of different oxidation states of supported
nickel species in bulk-like phase [21].
The reduction peaks associated with the Pt catalyst are
well documented in the previous section. The TPR spectrum
obtained from the bimetallic Pt-Ni catalyst consists of three
major features, one centered at 130 ◦C, one at 260 ◦C and
the other at 500 ◦C. This proﬁle is clearly a mixture of the
two spectra above, excluding the new feature at 260 ◦C. The
asymmetrical nature of the higher temperature feature sug-
gests the existence of two reduction peaks, probably due to
simultaneous reduction of Ni species and ceria support.
The peak at 260 ◦C due to the reduction of nickel oxide
species seems to have enhanced in presence of Pt, suggesting
that the structure and/or location of the NiO phase changes in
the presence of Pt. One cannot deﬁnitively assign this state to
the improved hydrogen yield over this catalyst relative to the
othertwo,butdoessuggestthatthisisastrong possibility.The
data suggests a possible scenario that may cause the resulting
enhancement noted in the activity with the presence of both
the Pt and Ni. A probable mechanism is that the Pt promotes
reduction in adjacent Ni sites which adsorb O2 and lend it to
the CO or CHx adsorption site, possibly Pt.
TPR data shows no lowering in the NiO reduction temper-
ature after Pt incorporation onto Ni catalysts suggesting no
Pt–Ni alloy formation. This can be anticipated considering
that platinum has a larger atomic radius and lower surface
tension than Ni. Also, the concentration of Ni is in excess
(5%) compared to Pt (1.25%). As a result, Pt tends to be ex-
cluded out of the Ni matrix leading to a strong Pt isolation
[22].
TPR spectra of the bimetallic Pt and Ni catalysts with dif-
ferent order of deposition on ceria support are shown in Fig. 8.

H2 uptake over the Ni-Pt catalyst followed the same pattern
as that of Pt-Ni catalyst (discussed above) except for the peak
at 260 ◦C. This peak is due to the reduction of oxide species
and is not as enhanced as that observed in the other catalyst,
clearly demonstrating the fact that the order of deposition
affects the oxidation states of metals. This difference in the
reduction mechanism is also reﬂected in the ATR activity of
these catalysts as noted in Fig. 4.
XPS characterization of the Pt and/or Ni catalysts was
performed and Table 2 presents the results of the peak BE so
analyzed. Assigned Pt peaks suggest 2+ and 4+ states of Pt.
The BE of Pt 4f of Pt-Ni catalyst seems to be higher than that
of Pt catalyst, while those of Ni 2p are similar between the
bimetallic and the Ni catalyst (855.4–855.3 eV), as shown in
Fig. 9.
Fig. 9. XPS characterization of ceria-supported Pt and/or Ni catalysts: Ni
2p spectra.
In comparison with the ceria-supported Ni catalyst, the
peak indicative of Ni 3s (Ni◦) species in the bimetallic Pt-Ni
catalyst is shifted towards a lower binding energy, indicating
a higher electron density in the Ni species in the bimetallic
catalyst. Although the Ni 2p BE values are comparable as
described above, the Pt 4f BE value of the bimetallic catalyst
is higher than that of the monometallic catalyst. This may
contribute to the enhancement of activity and stability of the
bimetallic catalysts. It can also be noted that, with platinum
incorporation, the reducibility of the Ni species increased as
observed in the TPR experiments.
The ceria-supported Pt-Ni catalysts are even more active
and stronger against deactivation in autothermal reforming
of diesel fuel than the corresponding monometallic Ni and
Pt catalysts. The activity of these catalysts seems to depend
on the order of metal loading and the formation of different
oxidation states during the synthesis of the catalysts. XPS
and TPR data indicate that the amounts of exposed Ni and
Pt sites are different among the catalysts, corresponding with
the differences in the catalytic activity and stability.
3.4. Characterization of Pt and/or Pd catalysts
The H2-TPR proﬁle of the unreduced bimetallic Pd-Pt cat-
alyst showed marked differences to those of the monometallic
catalysts. A sharp peak at about 100 ◦C is observed, which
is more intense than that in the monometallic Pd catalyst,
perhaps pointing to the formation of distinct PdO species,
so leading to a small reduction in temperature and a much
greater quantity of this species. These species alone cannot
be attributed to the improved activity and selectivity of the
bimetallic catalysts. Since the inﬂuence of bimetallic dis-
persion is not well understood during the TPR experiments,
further analysis was carried out by XPS characterization and
H2 chemisorption.
Fig. 10 presents the TPD proﬁle of H2 from the ceria-
supported Pt and/or Pd catalysts obtained following H2 ad-
sorption at 25 ◦C. Four major peaks at 120, 190, 310 and
680 ◦C can be distinguished on the Pt/ceria catalyst after
H2 chemisorption at 25 ◦C. For the bimetallic Pt-Pd/ceria

catalyst, signiﬁcant differences can be observed in the des-
orption proﬁle. While the ﬁrst three peaks at 160, 200 and
360 ◦C may correspond to the respective three peaks on the
Pt/ceria, the peak at 680 ◦C has shifted to a lower temperature
(560 ◦C).
In addition to the shift in the high-temperature peak, the
amount of hydrogen desorption decreased substantially over
the bimetallic catalyst. This may correspond to the strongly
bound H species in case of the monometallic catalyst, prob-
ably the hydride or the hydrogen species in the subsurface
layers of the metal catalyst [23]. While the major hydro-
gen species desorb at temperatures below 360 ◦C from the
bimetallic catalyst, they remain on Pt/ceria surface at temper-
atures higher than 400 ◦C. The H–metal bond on the Pt/ceria
catalyst appears to be stronger than that on the Pt-Pd/ceria,
suggesting that an interaction between Pt and Pd leads to
weakening of H–metal bond and, hence, better ATR activity
compared to its monometallic counterparts.
The Pd 3d core level spectra for Pt-ceria, Pd-ceria and
Pt/Pd-ceria catalysts studied are shown in Fig. 11. For the
monometallic Pd catalyst, the binding energy of the Pd 3d5/2
level emerged at 335.4 eV and was assigned to PdO [16]. For
the bimetallic Pt-Pd catalyst, a decrease in the Pd 3d5/2 signal
in addition to a positive binding energy shift to 336.5 eV was
found.
The positive shift possibly arises from changes in the elec-
tronic energy levels of Pd (2 2 0) in the presence of a second
metal [16]. This close Pt-Pd contact may account for the ob-
served decrease in the surface exposure of Pd due to the di-
lution effect of Pt on the bimetallic interaction.
However, the decrease in the surface coverage of Pd in-
dicates some Pt surface isolation in the bimetallic particles,
which could lead to secluded Pt cluster on the Pd surface.
Isolation of Pd in silica–alumina-supported Pt-Pd particles
was also found by Rades et al. [24]. These results clearly in-
dicate that the catalytic behavior of Pt-Pd/ceria for the ATR
of sulfur laden fuels is closely related to the presence of iso-
lated Pt species, in addition to the weak metal–hydrogen bond
strengths in the bimetallic catalysts, as observed in the H2-
TPD studies.
These kinds of species are claimed to be responsible for
the high-sulfur tolerance of supported bimetallic catalysts
[25,26]. Consequently, the enhanced performance of the Pt-
Pd catalysts may be attributed to the presence of a bimetallic
interaction, which reduces the tendency of Pt/Pd to chemisorb
sulfur or form bulk sulﬁde and subsequent spillover on to the
ceria support.
4. Conclusions
Catalytic autothermal reforming of synthetic diesel and
JP8 fuel was investigated for fuel cell hydrogen. Experimen-
tal results revealed that the impregnation of Ni or Pd (in ad-
dition to Pt) on alumina or ceria not only improves the ac-
tivity but also modiﬁes the catalyst to resist poisoning from
sulfur present in the feed. Characterization of these formu-
lations showed that the enhanced stability is due to a strong
metal–metal and metal–support interaction in the catalyst.
The improved performance of the bimetallic catalysts is due
to structural and electronic effects rather than the degree of
metal dispersion.
