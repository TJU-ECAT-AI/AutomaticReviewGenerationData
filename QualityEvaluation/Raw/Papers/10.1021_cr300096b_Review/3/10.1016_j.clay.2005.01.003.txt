Abstract
An Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) pillared montmorillonite was used to support 1.0 wt.% of the bimetallic
species Pd/Pt=5.0 and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. The resulting catalysts were characterized by XRPD, N2 physisorption, ammonia TPD
and FT-IR spectroscopy. The catalytic activity in the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis/ring-opening of naphthalene and thio-
tolerance to dibenzothiophene were investigated at 6.0 MPa in a flow reactor. Both catalysts showed interesting performances.
Of the two catalysts, the former showed higher productivities in hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis/ring-opening compounds
together with lower losses in carbon balance and higher thio-tolerance. These results not only confirmed that Pd/Pt is one of the
most suitable bimetallic pair for noble metal containing hydrotreating catalysts, but also that the Al/Ce/Mg PILC can be used as
low cost support for noble-metal-containing active phases.

1. Introduction
In the last two decades, pillared layered clays
(PILCs) have been largely used as catalysts and/or
supports for metal phases. (Pinnavaia, 1983; Klo-
progge, 1998; Vaccari, 1999; Ding et al., 2001). Their
properties are complementary to those of zeolites, and
can be modulated by carefully choosing the different
parameters (pillaring agent, type of clay and particle
size, pillaring procedure, thermal treatment), thus
offering a very flexible way to design tailored
catalysts. Moreover, these materials are quite inex-
pensive, if compared to zeolites. Therefore, their
possible use can be extended to a wide range of
catalytic reactions, including those related to oil
refining and hydrotreating processes (Ramos-Galvan

et al., 1997; Salerno et al., 2003; Martı
´nez-Ortiz et al.,
2003; Salerno et al., 2004). The removal, within the
refinery process, of aromatic hydrocarbons and
sulphur compounds from light oil fractions (LCO)
coming from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) has
received considerable attention in recent years, due
to both the increasing demand of diesel fuels and the
progressively more strict environmental regulations
(Stanislaus and Cooper, 1994; Cooper and Donnis,
1996). Thus, the development of catalytic technolo-
gies for aromatic saturation (HYD) or sulphur removal
(HDS) is in demand. New materials having catalytic
activity in deep hydrotreating now require:
– high thio-tolerance;
– controlled surface acidity, to permit hydrogenolysis/
ring-opening reactions to high molecular weight
(HMW) compounds having a high cetane number,
but avoiding cracking reactions to low molecular
weight (LMW) compounds, outside the diesel
range;
– adjustable mesoporosity, in order to allow the
diffusion of such voluminous molecules inside the
pores;
– stability under oxidative regeneration conditions.
Therefore PILCs can represent suitable supports for
catalysts to be used in these reactions, while replacing
the more expensive dealuminated zeolites and Si/Al
MCM-41 type materials (Sato et al., 1998; Corma et al.,
2001; Pawelec et al., 2002). For this purpose, a Al/Ce/
Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 a.r., pillared montmorillonite with
larger than usual micropores was prepared by modify-
ing a synthetic procedure reported in literature (Her-
nando et al., 2001). The active noble metals were then
supported by ion exchange with the appropriate metal
salts, to obtain the 1.0 wt.% final catalysts: Pd/Pt=5.0
atomic ratio (a.r.) (CAT1) and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. (CAT2).
In this work we investigated the catalytic activity
and thio-tolerance of these PILC based catalysts in the
hydrogenation of naphthalene under pressure. This
molecule was chosen as model of naphthenes con-
tained in LCO fractions (Albertazzi et al., 2003).
Naphthalene may easily be hydrogenated to 1,2,3,4-
tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin), which can be further,
and with higher difficulty, hydrogenated to decahy-
dronaphthalene (decalin) isomers (cis+trans). Crack-
ing reactions of both tetralin and decalin may also
occur, giving undesired LMW compounds (mainly
gases) that are outside the diesel range. On the
contrary, useful compounds are those derived from
hydrogenolysis/ring-opening pathways and called
HMW compounds (mainly alkylciclohexanes, alkyl-
benzenes, methylindanes and methylindenes, spyro-
decane), having high cetane numbers.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the support: montmorillonite
pillared with Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 a.r.
The montmorillonite pillared with Al/Ce/Mg was
prepared by modifying a known synthetic procedure
(Hernando et al., 2001), using Locron P (Clariant) as
source of Al. An aqueous solution (170 mL) contain-
ing [Al2(OH)5Cl*2–3H2O] (0.2083 mol), CeCl3*
7H2O (0.0083 mol) and MgCl2*6H2O (0.0083 mol)
was aged for 72 h at 130 8C in a glass vial. The cooled
reaction mixture was diluted to 4250 mL. A total
amount of 50.0 g of dry Ca-montmorillonite (Detercal
P1, Laviosa) was slowly added under vigorous stirring
to this solution, and the mixture was kept under
continuous stirring for 24 h at room temperature (r.t.),
then centrifuged and washed with distilled water until
it was free from chloride ions (AgNO3 test). The
resulting PILC was then dried at 100 8C for 12 h,
ground and heated in airflow at 550 8C for 24 h. The
material was successively kept under reduced pressure
in the presence of concentrated NH4OH to give the
ammonium form (NH4
+PILC).
2.2. Preparation of CAT1 (1.0 wt.% Pd/Pt=5.0 a.r.)
A total of 2.000 g of NH4
+PILC (60–120 mesh)
was added to a 170 mL aqueous solution containing
0.037 g of [Pd(NH3)4]Cl2*H2O and 0.009 g of
[Pt(NH3)4]Cl2*H2O. The mixture was stirred for
96 h at r.t., and then washed with distilled water till
Cl ions disappearance. The exchanged clay was
dried at 100 8C for 12 h, ground and heated in a
glass reactor in air flow at 400 8C for 12 h, (air
flow=80 mL/min, heating rate=1 8C/min), followed
by cooling under He flow, then it was reduced under
a H2 flow at 400 8C (H2 flow=40 mL/min, heating
rate=8 8C/min).

2.3. Preparation of CAT2 (1.0 wt.% Pd/Au=5.0 a.r.)
A total of 2.000 g of NH4
+PILC (60–120 mesh) was
added to a 170 mL aqueous solution containing 0.036
g of [Pd(NH3)4]Cl2*H2O and 0.009 g of HAuCl4. The
catalyst preparation was then carried out as described
in the previous sample.
2.4. Preparation of a reference catalyst (1.0 wt.%
Pd/Pt=4.0 a.r.)
As example of the commercial catalysts, a refer-
ence sample, containing the same total amount of
noble metals, was prepared by incipient wetness
impregnation of Pd- and Pt-containing salts on a
silica–alumina by Engelhard, according to a widely
claimed industrial patent (Vaarkamp et al., 1998).
2.5. Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) spectra were
recorded using a Philips PW 1319 goniometer, with
Cu Ka1 radiation (k=0.15418 nm, 40 kW, 20 mA).
The samples were disc shaped pressed powders.
N2 adsorption–desorption experiments were car-
ried out at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010
instrument. The N2 isotherms were used to determine
the specific surface areas (SA) using the BET
equation. The pore distribution of the investigated
samples was determined by the Density Functional
Theory (DFT) assuming a slit-like pores model (Webb
and Orr, 1997; Rouquerol et al., 1999). The micropore
volume was determined using the t-plot method and
the total pore volume of the samples, Vt, was
calculated at p/p0=0.98. Before each measurement
the samples were outgassed for 12 h at 150 8C and 0.7
Pa and for 2 h at r.t. and 0.5*106 Pa.
Ammonia TPD analyses were performed on
the pelletised fresh catalysts, using a Thermoquest
TPD/R/O 1100 instrument, carrying out a pre-treat-
ment with a 40 mL/min He flow up to 500 8C, an
adsorption step at 160 8C pulsing a NH3/He=10:90 v/v
mixture and a desorption step with a 40 mL/min He
flow up to 500 8C.
A Nicolet Nexus instrument, using conventional IR
cells connected to a gas manipulation apparatus,
recorded FT-IR spectra. The pure powders of the
catalysts CAT1 and CAT2 were pressed into self-
supporting disks, with an average weight of 30 mg.
Before CO adsorption experiments, each fresh sample
has been submitted to an bin situQ reduction treatment
consisting in heating in pure hydrogen (53.0 kPa) at
300 8C, followed by outgassing at the same temper-
ature in the IR cell itself. CO adsorption has been
performed at r.t., and spectra have been recorded at
increasing CO partial pressure and after outgassing
the samples at r.t. and/or 100 8C.
2.6. Catalytic tests
The catalytic tests were performed at 6.0 MPa (if
not otherwise specified H2/N2=1:1 v/v) and in the
220–340 8C range using a stainless steel tubular
reactor (i.d. 8 mm, length 54 cm), heated by an
electric oven controlled by two J-thermocouples. 6
mL of catalyst (14–20 mesh) was employed, located
in the isothermal zone of the reactor. During the tests,
the catalyst temperature was controlled using a 0.5
mm J-thermocouple sliding in a stainless steel
capillary tube inside the catalytic bed. Before the
tests, the catalyst was activated in a 200 mL/min flow
of H2, using a programmed increase of the temper-
ature from r.t. up to 450 8C. A solution of 10 wt.%
naphthalene (analytical grade) in n-heptane was fed
using a HPLC Jasco 880-PU pump, in a gas flow of a
H2/N2 mixture (if not otherwise specified 1:1 v/v).
Each catalytic test was performed for 5 h, collecting
the products in a trap cooled to 10 8C after a
preliminary period of 1 h, under the same conditions,
to achieve a steady state activity. The quantitative
analysis of the reaction products was carried out using
a Carlo Erba GC6000 gas chromatograph, equipped
with FID and a wide bore PS264 column (5.0 wt.%
methylphenylsilicone, length 25 m, inner diameter
0.53 mm, film width 1.5 Am). The products were
preliminary and tentatively identified by GC-MS
using a Hewlett-Packard GCD 1800 system equipped
with a HP5 column (5% of methylphenylsilicone,
length 25 m, inner diameter 0.25 mm, film width 0.25
Am) while comparing the experimental GC-MS
pattern with those present in the instrument library.
A wide range of reaction conditions was investigated
(temperature, contact time, H2/naphthalene ratio).
Furthermore, since all the hydrotreated feeds contain
small amounts of sulphur compounds responsible for
catalyst poisoning, the thio-tolerance of the catalysts
S. Albertazzi et al. / Applied Clay Science 29 (2005) 224–234
226
was also investigated by feeding increasing amounts
of dibenzothiophene (DBT), representative of the S-
containing molecules usually present in the industrial
feeds.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Textural properties
The BET surface area (BET SA), the micropore
volume (VA) and the total pore volume (Vt) were
determined on the Al/Ce/Mg PILC before and after
loading the metals and their reduction. As shown in
Table 1, both the catalysts maintain surface area
values close to those of the support (surface area and
pore volume decreased less than 20%). In Figs. 1 and
2, the pore distributions of the investigated samples,
determined by DFT method, are reported. The pore
distribution of the support shows a sharp peak centred
at 1.3 nm and a second one at 2.3 nm, and it remains
bimodal also after the loading of the metals and the
subsequent reduction in H2. The micropores and the
total pore volume, show only a slight decrease. That,
in the case of CAT1, is little more pronounced than
CAT2. Nevertheless, as shown in Table 1, after the
title reaction, the BET surface area values of the
catalysts show a relevant decrease (CAT2 more than
CAT1). The main reason for the occlusion of the pores
and the consequent drop of the surface area of the
exhaust catalysts can be ascribed to a large tar
deposition on the catalyst surface and inside the
pores, favoured by both the high microporosity and
acidity of the support.
Ammonia TPD is a commonly used technique for
the titration of surface acid sites. It is generally
accepted that ammonia is an excellent probe molecule
for testing the acid properties of solid catalysts, since
its strong basicity and small molecular size allow the
detection of acid sites located even in very narrow
pores. Therefore, the total amount of ammonia
desorption after saturation allows the quantification
of the number of acid sites on the surface. Ammonia
TPD analyses show that the support has a lower total
amount of acid sites than commercial hydrotreating
catalysts (Fujikawa et al., 2000; Barrio et al., 2003) or
activated clays (Flessner et al., 2001). The acidities, of
the noble metal containing PILC samples (Table 1), as
measured by this technique, are apparently signifi-
cantly higher than that of the support, regardless of the
catalyst composition. This behaviour is not unusual
for supported noble metals on acidic supports and
higher amounts, compared with the support, of
adsorbed/desorbed ammonia were detected by other
authors (Barrio et al., 2004; Arias et al., 2000) in
similar cases. Nevertheless the quantitative correlation
of these data with the acidity of the catalyst is not
obvious because the possible occurrence of ammonia
decomposition to nitrogen, detectable only by mass
spectroscopy (Skotak et al., 2002) and of ammonia
chemisorption, with not exactly known stoichiome-
tries, on the surface of the reduced noble metal.
Furthermore in the case of the generation of the active
metal sites by reduction of cationic species exchanged
on the clay surface, the final surface acidity will
depend by the evolution of the metal/support inter-
action during the reduction step (Vicente and Lambert,
2001). Thus, in this case a defined stoichiometry
cannot be determined and the acidity values do not
allow to draw exhaustive conclusions; however, it is
noteworthy that for both noble metal containing PILC
catalysts the values are about 20% lower than that of
the analogous Pd/Pt on silica–alumina catalyst used as
reference. Some authors (Sato et al., 1998; Albertazzi
et al., 2004; Galperin et al., 2003) claimed that the
acidity of the support is a key factor in both the useful

metal phases can be detected in all the patterns,
highlighting a good and stable metal dispersion.
3.2. FT-IR characterisation by CO adsorption
The spectra of CO adsorbed at r.t. over reduced
CAT1 sample (Fig. 5a–c) show a main and quite
broad band at 2098 cm1, due to CO linearly
adsorbed over Pt and/or Pd metal particles, and a
complex band with two maxima at 1975 and 1909
cm1, due to carbonyl stretching of bridging CO
species over Pd0. As previously reported for bimet-
allic Pd/Pt systems (Albertazzi et al., 2004), these two
components can be assigned to CO bridged com-
pressed species and isolated species, respectively,
pointing out the presence of large Pd planes. After
outgassing (Fig. 5d and e), the position of the main
peak slightly shifts toward lower frequencies (2090
cm1), due to a decreasing of the dipole–dipole
interaction between adjacent CO molecules, while
the component at 1976 cm1 of the broad absorption
almost disappears, according to its assignation to
closely interacting CO species. After outgassing at
increasing temperature (spectrum not reported) a main
band is still detectable around 2080 cm1, due to on-
Fig. 4. XRPD patterns of CAT2 (1.0 wt.% Pd/Au=5.0 a.r.) and the
PILC support.

and after outgassing at room temperature for 30 min (e).

229
top adsorbed CO species, and another weak absorp-
tion at 1880 cm1 is assigned to multibonded,
probably three fold-bonded, species.
The spectra of CO adsorbed at r.t. over reduced
CAT2 sample (Fig. 6a–c) show a weak but complex
band at 2190 cm1, with a shoulder at 2174 cm1, a
main sharp band at 2107 cm1 and a broad band at
1977 cm1 with a shoulder at 1910 cm1. Following
literature results (Sheppard et al., 1978) the band at
2107 cm1 is assignable to CO adsorbed over Pd0
(terminal Pd–CO) while, again, bands at lower
frequencies are assigned to the stretching of com-
pressed and to isolated bridging carbonyls over Pd0
centres. The weak signal at 2190 cm1 could be
assigned to CO adsorbed over the support, while the
component at 2174 cm1 may arise from CO
adsorption over some residual oxidized gold ions
(Bocuzzi et al., 2001; Brayner et al., 2003). The band
due to CO linearly bonded over reduced gold sites
supported on different oxides has been reported in the
range 2135–2127 cm1 (Venezia et al., 2003; Brayner
et al., 2003), thus, in our spectra, this band is likely
masked by the stronger absorption due to Pd0–CO
stretching mode. The spectra after outgassing (Fig. 6d
and e) show a trend similar to those already described
for CAT1.
In conclusion, the effect of alloying in Pd/Au and,
to a lesser extent, Pd/Pt particles should lead to a
low-frequency shift of the stretching vibrations of
adsorbed Pd–CO carbonyl species (Venezia et al.,
2003; Pawelec et al., 2002) which, however, is not so
evident in CAT1 and CAT2 spectra, where this band
is centred at 2100 cm1. From IR results the
formation of alloyed particles is thus still doubtful.
It seems likely that bimetallic Pd-rich particles are
formed in both cases. A comparison of the spectra of
CO over both bimetallic systems points out the
presence of larger metallic particles in the Pd/Au
system; in fact the integral band intensity ratio
(bridging CO species/linear CO species) is higher
in this case. Moreover, the subtraction spectrum [CO
adsorbed over Pd/Au system][CO adsorbed over
Pd/Pt system] evidences in the Pd/Au spectrum only
two positive peaks at 2127 cm1, due to Au0–CO
stretching mode, as previously discussed, and at
1984 cm1 assigned to stretching modes of com-
pressed CO bridging species over Pd particles, thus
supporting the idea of larger metal particles in this
sample.
3.3. Activity of CAT1 (1.0 wt.% Pd/Pt=5.0 a.r.)
At 260 8C this sample shows a high hydrogenation
activity (yield in decalin), that decreases in the
successive tests at higher temperatures in agreement
with the exothermic nature of the hydrogenation
reaction (Table 2). An opposite trend is observed for
the yield in HMW compounds, that increases by
increasing the reaction temperature, in agreement with
the endothermic feature of the hydrogenolysis/ring-
opening reactions. In all the tests at different temper-
atures, the naphthalene conversion is almost complete
and the yield in tetralin is very low, thus highlighting a
high activity. Moreover, the cracking activity (detected
from the losses in the carbon balance) is moderate,
even at 300 and 340 8C, temperatures that favour
the endothermic cracking reactions. In the final test at
260 8C (carried out to check the sample stability after
the tests at high temperature) the obtained perform-
ances are very similar to those obtained at the
beginning, thus evidencing the good stability of this
catalyst. While decreasing the contact time, the yield
both in tetralin and decalin (cis+trans) increases with a
corresponding decrease in the formation of HMW and
LMW products, that are mainly formed by consec-
utive reactions. However, the naphthalene conversion
is almost complete in the whole range of investigated
contact time values. The decrease of the H2 excess,

reduced CAT2 (PdAu), in the presence of 66.7 Pa CO (a), 133.3
Pa CO (b), 266.6 Pa CO (c), after outgassing at room temperature
(d) and after outgassing at room temperature for 30 min (e).

from more than four times the stoichiometric ratio (H2/
naphthalene=21.0 mol/mol) down to 2.5 times (H2/
naphthalene=12.0 mol/mol) gives rise to a worsening
of the hydrogenation to decalin (cis+trans), while the
yield in tetralin slightly increases, highlighting that the
full hydrogenation of naphthalene requires an H2
amount significantly higher than that imposed by the
reaction stoichiometry. Furthermore, both the yield in
HMW compounds and the naphthalene conversion
decrease, evidencing that a high H2 partial pressure is
necessary not only to obtain decalin but also to favour
the hydrogenolysis/ring-opening reactions and to
reach an almost complete conversion. Indeed, for
H2/naphthalene molar ratios lower than 21.0, the main
products are the LMW compounds formed by crack-
ing reactions. Finally, the thio-tolerance of CAT1 was
investigated by adding increasing amounts of diben-
zothiophene (DBT) to the feed in order to obtain wider
information on the poisoning by S-containing com-
pounds. It is noteworthy that 3000 weight ppm of
DBT (corresponding to 510 wt. ppm of S) are more
representative of S-concentration in typical LCO feeds
than low sulfur levels. On increasing the amount of
DBT in the feed, the naphthalene conversion slightly
decreases and the yield in tetralin rises up to more than
20%. It must be noted that the increasing yield in
tetralin is a more sensible index of deactivation than a
decrease of naphthalene conversion, since tetralin is
more thermodynamically stable than naphthalene.
Also the yield in HMW compounds worsens, while
the formation of the LMW compounds, on the basis of
the losses in the carbon balance, remains stable till
3000 wt. ppm of DBT. Surprisingly, the hydrogena-
tion activity to decalin (cis+trans) of this sample is
unaffected even by 3000 weight ppm of DBT,
probably due to the claimed thio-resistance of the
Pd/Pt alloy (Yasuda and Yoshimura, 1997; Yasuda et
al., 1998; Navarro et al., 2000; Rousset et al., 2001;
Albertazzi et al., 2004). While removing the DBT
from the feed, the catalyst almost recovers its initial
performance, except for the yield in HMW that
remains low.

3.4. Activity of CAT2 (1.0 wt.% Pd/Au=5.0 a.r.)
This sample shows a lower hydrogenation activity
that further decreases by increasing the reaction
temperature (Table 3). The yield in HMW com-
pounds and the losses in carbon balances increase by
increasing the temperature, while the formation of
tetralin remains almost low and stable. In the further
test at 260 8C, both hydrogenation and hydro-
genolysis/ring-opening activities decrease, evidenc-
ing a significant deactivation promoted by the high
temperature reached in the previous test. The
decrease of the contact time to 1.7 s enhances the
hydrogenation activity (more than 80% of yield in
decalin), with a corresponding decrease in the
formation of HMW and LMW compounds. The
naphthalene conversion and the yield in tetralin have
only slight variations, with a little increase for the
former and a small decrease for the latter. Surpris-
ingly, the same trend is evidenced also by decreasing
the H2/naphthalene molar ratio, despite the behaviour
previously shown by the CAT1 sample. This
anomalous trend may be justified assuming that the
high GHSV fed in the previous tests cleaned the
catalyst surface from the deposited tar. The addition
of increasing amounts of DBT in the feed gives rise
to a decrease in the naphthalene conversion and an
increase in the yield in tetralin, both evidences of a
deactivation. The yield in HMW decreases at the
first addition of DBT, like the carbon balance losses.
Also the decalin formation that was boosted in the
previous tests shows a slight decrease, evidencing a
global loss in the hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis/
ring-opening and cracking activities. On removing
the DBT from the feed, the catalyst partially recovers
its initial performances, with a higher hydrogenation
activity and a lower LMW formation.

compared in terms of productivity at 300 8C in
decalin (DeHN) and hydrogenolysis/ring-opening
(HMW) products for kilogram of catalyst (Fig. 7),
the most interesting between the investigated reac-
tion temperatures. The productivity per weight unit
highlights the specific activity of the active sites,
reflecting also on the cost of the catalyst. Fig. 7
shows that CAT1 gives rise to higher productivities
in hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis/ring-opening
compounds than CAT2, with also lower losses in
the carbon balance and a higher S-resistance (Tables
2 and 3). For the sake of comparison, the produc-
tivity per kilogram both in decalin (cis+trans) and
HMW compounds of a Pd/Pt on silica–alumina
reference catalyst (REF), chosen as example of the
commercial catalysts, is also reported in Fig. 7. The
reference sample shows very high productivities in
both hydrogenation (decalin) and hydrogenolysis/
ring opening (HMW) compounds, significantly better
than those of the two noble metal containing PILC
samples, combined with a very good thio-tolerance
(at least 3000 ppm weight) of DBT. These better
performances of the reference catalyst may be
mainly attributed to its higher values of BET surface
area and/or surface acidity determined by ammonia
TPD (Table 1), although these latter may be affected
by some interferences (Barrio et al., 2004; Arias et
al., 2000; Skotak et al., 2002; Vicente and Lambert,
2001).
4. Conclusions
An Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 a.r. pillared montmor-
illonite, with a high d001 spacing and a bimodal pore
distribution of micro- and mesopores, was used as
support for noble metal pairs, to prepare the catalysts:
1.0 wt.% Pd/Pt=5.0 a.r. (CAT1) and 1.0 wt.% Pd/
Au=5.0 a.r. (CAT2). The evaluation of the surface
acidity of the support by ammonia TPD shows that
these materials have less and weaker acid sites than
typical hydrotreating catalysts (zeolites or SiO2/Al2O3)
and even activated Al-PILCs. Both catalysts show
interesting performances in the hydrogenation of
naphthalene at 6.0 MPa, associated with a good thio-
tolerance, checked feeding increasing amounts of DBT.
Their structure and textural properties are stable in the
used reaction conditions. However, CAT1 (Pd/Pt)
shows higher productivity in hydrogenation and hydro-
genolysis/ring-opening compounds than CAT2 (Pd/
Au), as well as lower losses in the carbon balance and a
higher thio-tolerance. These results confirm that not
only Pd/Pt is one of the most suitable bimetallic pair for
noble metal containing hydrotreating catalysts, but also
that these improved PILCs may have applications as
cheap novel supports for such active phase.
