Low energy electron microscopy (LEEM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) have been used to
investigate the faceting of W(111) as induced by Pt. The atomically rough W(111) surface, when fully
covered with a monolayer ﬁlm of Pt and annealed to temperatures higher than ∼750 K, experiences a
signiﬁcant morphological restructuring: the initially planar surface undergoes a faceting transition and
forms three-sided pyramids with {211} faces. When Pt is dosed onto the heated surface, the transition
from planar to faceted structure proceeds through the nucleation and growth of spatially separated
faceted region, as shown by LEEM. STM reveals the atomic structure of the partially faceted surface,
with large planar regions, dotted by clusters of pyramids of various sizes.

Introduction
The faceting of W(111) and Mo(111) surfaces as in-
duced by thin metallic adsorbate ﬁlms1–3 is one of
the most intriguing phenomena in large scale mor-
phological transformations of metal surfaces.
In
addition to their academic interest, the thin-ﬁlm-
covered bcc(111) metal surfaces are model bimetallic
catalysts of key importance, as they provide insights
into the eﬀect of surface structure on reactivity and
selectivity.4,5 Many aspects of the faceting transition
have been studied in detail. Facets have been identi-
ﬁed as three-sided pyramids with {211} sides, using
both low energy electron diﬀraction2,6,7 and atomic
resolution STM.8 It was also shown that the pyra-
mids are composed of tungsten, with a thin adsor-
bate ﬁlm cover, rather than being pure adsorbate
clusters.9,10
A number of metals have been investigated as ad-
sorbates on W(111) and Mo(111); among them Pt,
Pd, Au, Rh and Ir are found to induce faceting.2,3,7
It has been established that there is a minimum
ﬁlm thickness necessary for the surface to be com-
pletely faceted, and this critical adsorbate coverage
is one “physical” monolayer (∼1.7×1015 atom/cm2),
which, in the case of the atomically rough bcc(111)
surface, is equivalent to three “geometrical” mono-
layers using the conventional deﬁnition (Fig. 1). A
large anisotropy in surface free energy has been
identiﬁed as the driving force for faceting by ﬁrst
Fig. 1.

strate that atoms from the three outermost layers are
exposed to the surface. When a metal adlayer is grown
epitaxially on W(111), three diﬀerent atomic layers are
needed to cover every W atom — these three “geometri-
cal” monolayers together form one “physical” monolayer.

principles calculations,11 and the sane calculations
also verify the strong coverage dependence. It was
also found that the faceting transition does not oc-
cur spontaneously at room temperature, due to ki-
netic limitations. In order to overcome the kinetic
barrier and induce faceting the surface has to be an-
nealed above a threshold temperature of ∼750 K.
The average pyramid size is also found to increase
with annealing temperature, from less than 100 ˚
A
at low temperatures, up to ∼700 ˚
A for Pt/W(111)
annealed to 1400 K.12,13
There are scientiﬁc issues, however, that are yet
to be addressed in more detail in connection with
metal overlayer induced faceting. These include the
nature of facet nucleation, coexistence of faceted and
planar surfaces, facet growth (with annealing time),
and a high temperature reversible transition from
faceted to planar surface.14
In the present work we use a scanning tunneling
microscope and a low energy electron microscope15
to provide new insights into the Pt-induced faceting
of W(111). LEEM can distinguish between planar
and faceted surfaces based on the diﬀerent types of
diﬀraction of low energy electrons on surfaces with
diﬀerent morphologies, with up to ∼70 ˚
A spatial
resolution.
Under certain conditions a coexistence of faceted
and planar regions has been observed using LEED
and STM for the Pt/W(111),1 Pd/Mo(111) and
Au/Mo(111) systems.14 LEEM is capable of provid-
ing information on the spatial distribution of such
coexistence phases. Most important, it enables real
time observation of structural and morphological
changes, such as the transitions from planar to co-
existence to faceted systems. Our main objective is
to conduct real time observations of the nucleation
and growth of Pt-induced faceting of W(111) using
LEEM, and compare our results to high resolution
STM measurements on the same system.

Low Energy Electron Microscopy
2.1.
Experiments
The LEEM experiments were performed at Sandia
National Laboratories using a commercial Elmitec
microscope15 (STM experiments — performed and
Rutgers — are discussed in Sec. 3). The LEEM ap-
paratus is housed in a conventional stainless steel
ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system with an average
base pressure of 2 × 10−10 torr. LEEM images and
LEED patterns are formed on a channel plate inten-
siﬁer, and imaged by a phosphor screen. The images
are recorded onto video cassettes using a CCD cam-
era. A video image-grabbing software also enables
the storage of LEEM pictures on a computer for fur-
ther analysis.
Attached to the main LEEM chamber are two
separate preparation chambers:
one for sample
cleaning, and the other equipped with a cylindri-
cal mirror analyzer and a concentric electron gun for
Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). We use AES to
check sample cleanliness and to determine the ap-
proximate Pt coverage, using the calibration of Pt
to W Auger peak ratio versus coverage of previous
works.1,16
The W(111) sample is cleaned in an auxiliary
chamber by ﬂashing to temperatures above 2400 K
using electron bombardment heating, while lower
temperature anneals (up to 1500 K) are performed
in the LEEM chamber in situ. The sample temper-
ature is measured using both an infrared pyrometer
and matched ﬁlament pyrometer.
The chamber is equipped with a Pt evaporation
source for dosing the W(111) sample in situ, allow-
ing the observation of the surface while it is being
dosed. Ultrathin Pt ﬁlms are deposited from a com-
mercial metal evaporator, in which a Mo rod holding
a small Pt ball is heated by electron bombardment.
The dosing rate is automatically kept constant by
monitoring the beam ﬂux. For the experiments out-
lined below very low deposition rates were desirable:
the estimated eﬀective deposition rate at the sam-
ple surface is approximately 3 × 1011 atoms/cm2/s,
which results in a full physical monolayer coverage
in ∼90 min.
As described below, we aimed to observe the fully
or partially faceted surfaces in real space. However,
the most important advantage of LEEM is its capa-
bility of imaging a surface in real in real time, even
surfaces at high temperatures, or surfaces as they are
being dosed. The main objective of the LEEM ex-
periments, therefore, was to conduct real time obser-
vations of the nucleation and growth of Pt-induced
faceting of W(111), i.e. observing the sample kept
at a constant elevated temperature while Pt is being
slowly deposited onto the surface.

2.2.
Results
The transition from a planar
to
fully faceted
Pt/W(111) surface is conﬁrmed by using the mi-
croscope in LEED mode, when the Pt coverage ex-
ceeds a critical coverage of one physical monolayer
(i.e. every W surface atom is covered by a Pt atom,
∼1.7 × 1015 atoms/cm2) and the sample is an-
nealed between 750 and 1200 K. The identiﬁcation
of faceting of a W(111) surface using LEED has been
well described before.1,6,7 The three-sided pyramids
of the faceted W(111) surface have equivalent {211}
faces: (211), (121) and (112). Therefore, the LEED
pattern of the faceted W(111) surface is a superposi-
tion of three distinct rotated and tilted {211} LEED
patterns.
At coverages between 0.7 and 1 physical mono-
layer, the Pt/W(111) surface produces a superposi-
tion of planar and faceted LEED patterns (Fig. 2),
indicating a partially faceted surface structure. The
fact planar W(111) and faceted {211} regions give
rise to diﬀerent diﬀraction beams in LEED may
be exploited in LEEM, by applying a small aperture
to one of the diﬀraction beams only, and forming
a real-space image of the surface using this single
beam. In the so-called “bright ﬁeld” imaging mode
the selected beam is the specular (0,0) beam from
the planar surface, and as a result planar regions ap-
pear bright, while faceted regions appear dark on the
LEEM screen [Fig. 3(a)].
The experiments aimed at observing the nucle-
ation and growth of Pt-induced faceting of W(111)
yielded results such as the one presented in Fig. 3.17
The ﬁgure shows a sequence of bright ﬁeld images of
the surface at 1050 K, as the surface is being dosed
at a rate of ∼1 physical monolayer of Pt per 90 min.
LEEM detects no change in the surface structure for
the ﬁrst 60 min, up to a coverage of 2/3 physical

monolayer.
After ∼60 min well-deﬁned small is-
lands of faceted regions (dark circular spots) become
observable [Fig. 3(a)]. After ∼90 min the surface
appears uniformly dark, i.e. fully faceted [Fig. 3(f)].
When compared to STM data presented in Sec. 3, it
is obvious that even the small dark areas in Fig. 3(a),
approximately 1000–3000 ˚
A in diameter, do not cor-
respond to individual facets, but rather to faceted
regions of the surface. It is also interesting to note
that, aside from initial nuclei on Fig. 3(a), there is
no further nucleation observable during growth.
We have also attempted to observe the nucleation
and growth of faceted features when Pt is dosed onto
the W(111) substrate at room temperature (in ex-
cess of one physical monolayer), and then the sam-
ple is gradually heated to high temperatures (up to
1200 K) while observing the surface with LEEM.
However, a nucleation and growth type transition
cannot be observed in this case, due to the uniform
roughening of the entire W(111) surface that is be-
lieved to be the initial stage of faceting, as shown by
STM (see Subsec. 3.2).

The STM is operated in a conventional stainless

composition. A conventional four grid reverse-view
LEED optics is used to obtain surface structural
information.
The sample is a W(111) single crystal disk iden-
tical to that used in the LEEM experiments. The
sample is supported by a Ta wire (0.5 mm diameter)
loop, spot-welded to the circumference of the sample
at several points, which is in turn spot-welded to a
molybdenum cylinder that serves as the structural
support during STM scans. Electron beam heating
is used to clean the sample of surface contaminants
by ﬂashing the surface to high temperatures (up to
2500 K). Similar to the LEEM system setup, the
sample is positioned in front of a spiral W ﬁlament
that is heated resistively to incandescence, while the
sample is kept at high positive potential (1500 V). A
second spiral W ﬁlament is part of the sample holder
assembly which is usually inserted into the back of
the molybdenum cylinder (except while scanning) for
sample manipulation. This second ﬁlament is used
for e-beam heating when annealing the sample at low
temperatures (up to 1400 K). This arrangement with
the heating ﬁlament mounted behind the sample en-
ables the use of an infrared pyrometer to measure
the temperature during annealing.
Ultrathin Pt ﬁlms are deposited from a water-
cooled metal evaporator, consisting of a piece of high
purity Pt foil (0.1 mm thick, 1 × 5 mm in size) spot-
welded to a W wire (0.5 mm in diameter) which is
heated resistively. Outgassing loops enable a thor-
ough degassing of the source without loss of mate-
rial, and the pressure in the chamber remains be-
low 4 × 10−10 even while dosing Pt at a source tem-
perature of ∼1700 K. In order to minimize sam-
ple contamination during overlayer deposition, faster
evaporation rates are used than in the LEEM experi-
ment, on the order of one physical monolayer per ten
minutes.
Long time high temperature anneal of the sample,
and therefore of the molybdenum support cylinder,
would result in unacceptable levels of outgassing and
sample contamination. STM measurements, there-
fore, are a modiﬁed version of the above-described
LEEM experiments.
The sample is initially de-
posited with a desired Pt coverage, then annealed at
high temperatures to induce faceting. After Pt de-
position and annealing the sample is allowed to cool.
Faceted or partially faceted surface structures are
identiﬁed using LEED observations made at room
temperature with electron energies between 50 and
250 eV; then the sample is transferred to the STM
for scanning.
3.2.
Results
When the W(111) surface is covered with a thin pt
ﬁlm slightly in excess of one physical monolayer, a
fully faceted LEED pattern is observed [Fig. 2(b)]
and STM reveals a fully faceted surface, composed
of three-sided pyramids and adjacent pits with sharp
edges. Figure 4 shows one such surface with ∼1.1
physical monolayer Pt coverage, annealed at 1200 K
(all STM images presented in the paper are dis-
played in XSLOPE mode, which gives a 3D top view
perspective of the pyramids, with an apparent light
source to the right). Annealing at this temperature
results in facets having dimensions ranging from 200
to 500 ˚
A.
When the surface is deposited with Pt in the 0.7–
1 physical monolayer coverage range and annealed
above threshold temperatures (> 750 K), a partially
faceted surface results.
LEED shows a superposi-
tion of planar and faceted patterns [Fig. 2(c)]. STM
shows large planar areas with scattered clusters of
pyramids. Figures 5 and 6 are scans of a partially
faceted surface, with Pt coverage ∼0.8 physical
monolayers and an annealing temperature of 1200 K.

There are two impor-

First, relatively large pyramids
(200–700 ˚

Angstroms in extent. Some pyramids have
neighboring pits (Fig. 6, center), indicating short dis-
tance direct mass transport; some are surrounded
by planar regions only, indicating long range mass
transport from planar regions to form large scale
facets. Second, every large pyramid appears to be

surrounded by a large number of satellite pyramids.
Near-atomic resolution scans reveal that these are in-
deed small pyramids rather than random clusters, as
they possess the structure of faceted pyramids, with
{211}-oriented sides.
As mentioned previously, it is important to note
that pyramids are not Pt clusters; rather, they are
composed of tungsten and covered with a thin ﬁlm
Pt.9,10 In order to generate pure Pt pyramids of the
size and density shown in Fig. 5, an average Pt cov-
erage of ∼4 physical monolayers would be required;
this is much greater than the 0.8 physical monolayer
used here.
We also mentioned in Subsec. 2.2 that LEEM
does not show a nucleation and growth type tran-
sition in experiments where the W(111) substrate
is ﬁrst dosed with Pt in excess of one physical
monolayer at room temperature, then the substrate
is gradually annealed to higher temperatures to
induce faceting.
We attribute the lack of observ-
able nucleation and growth to the uniform rough-
ening of the W(111) surface toward a faceted ge-
ometry.

surface covered with ∼1.2 physical monolayers of

faceting transition) for 1 min. These scans reveal the
rough surface that is believed to represent the ini-
tial stages of faceting. Note that the observed struc-
ture is composed of very small pyramid-like bumps
with {211} sides, and short ridges running parallel
to the surface in either of the [110], [101] or [011]
directions. Based on geometrical arguments, these
ridges are believed to be composed of (110)+(112),
(101)+(121) or (011)+(211) faces on opposite sides
[Fig. 7(c)], respectively, or highly stepped (vicinal)
surfaces thereof. This surface gives a somewhat fuzzy
{211}-faceted LEED pattern with high diﬀuse back-
ground (indicating disorder on the surface).
The
fuzzy facet LEED spots are attributed to the small
pyramidal bumps1 visible in Fig. 7(a). The dimen-
sions of the sides of the ridges (10–20 ˚
A) is less than
the transfer width of the low energy electron beam;
this is consistent with the absence of {110} spots.
Note that ridges running in the three diﬀerent di-
rections form triangular structures that are oriented
the same way as the {211} pyramids. When the same
surface is annealed to higher temperatures (1000 K),
the ridges are replaced by {211} pyramids [Fig. 7(d)].
This observation lends further support to our hy-
pothesis that ridges of Fig. 7(c) represent the initial
stages of faceting at constant overlayer coverage.
4.
Discussion
An interesting conclusion based on our LEEM ex-
periments is that the fully faceted surface is achieved
through a nucleation and subsequent growth of a rel-
atively few faceted regions. This implies that the Pt
ﬁlm itself grows via a nucleation/growth process.
The processes of ﬁlm growth during deposition of
atoms on surfaces, including the nucleation, growth
and coalescence of adsorbate islands, are among the
best-studied phenomena in surface science. Experi-
mental methods range diﬀraction techniques (such
as SPA-LEED18 and thermal energy helium-atom
scattering18–20) to real space observations using
STM,21–26 transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
and LEEM;27 theoretical predictions and models also
abound.28–33
Metal adsorbates, when deposited onto metal sur-
faces at temperatures ≥300 K, often have high mo-
bility and condense into 2D or 3D islands.23,24 These
islands may be nucleated either at terrace edges
or other surface defects such as screw dislocations
(heterogeneous nucleation),23,27 or in the middle of
wide terraces, if the adsorbate density is high enough
for the spontaneous creation of nuclei because the
number of atoms exceeds a critical value (homoge-
nous nucleation),24,26 or both.21,25
One physical monolayer on the W(111) sur-
face comprises three diﬀerent layers, also referred
to as three geometrical monolayers.
Based on
synchrotron soft X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
(SXPS) measurements,10 refractory metals, includ-
ing Pt, are believed to grow layer by layer on W
before completion of the ﬁrst physical monolayer.
This suggests that the ﬁrst two geometrical mono-
layers (2/3 of a physical monolayer) are completed
before the third layer nucleates and spreads via is-
land growth. This suggests that while Pt adatoms
in the ﬁrst two geometrical monolayers remain rel-
atively stable on the W(111) surface, the Pt atoms
deposited on top of this surface readily diﬀuse around
until they bond to an already growing island.
While regions covered with 2/3 of a physical
monolayer remain planar, faceting begins under Pt
islands where the critical coverage has been reached.
It is important to note that as the faceted regions
grow, there appear to be no new regions nucleated
on the remaining planar surface (Fig. 3). This may
be explained by the rapid diﬀusion of Pt atoms at
the elevated temperature of 1050 K, and the very low
impingement ﬂux. The combination of these two fac-
tors results in a low probability of island nucleation
as compared to the growth rate of existing islands.
Note that the formation of overlayer islands in
the third geometrical monolayer must depend on a
delicate energetic balance, since — due to the atom-
ically rough structure of the bcc(111) surface —
atoms within this layer interact via second nearest-
neighbor interactions only. It is possible, however,
that overlayer islands that reach the critical thick-
ness of one physical monolayer thickness are not only
responsible for inducing the faceting transition of the
tungsten substrate, they may also be stabilized en-
ergetically by the faceting process. On the faceted
surface the overlayer atoms essentially form a physi-
cal monolayer coverage on W(211) faces, which may
provide stronger overlayer-to-substrate bonding than
on planar W(111). As a results, Pt adatoms diﬀus-
ing on the surface may stick preferentially to already
faceted regions. This question clearly calls for a de-
tailed theoretical investigation.

Nucleation and Growth During Faceting of the Platinum-Covered W(111) Surface
773
The STM data conﬁrm the LEEM observations
that a partially faceted surface is a combination of
large planar regions, with scattered faceted regions.
The faceted regions include clusters of pyramids of
two distinct size distributions: large individual pyra-
mids or clusters of large pyramids, surrounded by
smaller size satellite pyramids. The latter are consis-
tent with the relatively round shape of the overlayer
Pt islands that induce the faceting [Fig. 3(a)]: the
role of the small satellite pyramids is to ﬁll in the
rounded outline imposed by the island.
STM and LEEM experiments are also in agree-
ment concerning the initial stages of faceting at con-
stant overlayer coverage. LEEM indicates the lack
of a nucleation and growth type transition from the
planar to a faceted structure, and suggests the uni-
form roughening of the surface instead. STM reveals
the rough atomic structure of the initial stages of
faceting, with microfaceted structures (ridges) that
are believed to evolve into {211} facets upon further
annealing.

Conclusions
We
have
demonstrated
using
real-time
LEEM
observations that when Pt is deposited onto a heated
W(111) substrate, the well-known faceting process
progresses through the nucleation and growth of
fully faceted regions distributed over the otherwise
planar surface.
STM reveals that each faceted
region is a cluster of pyramidal facets of various
sizes.
LEEM and STM prove to be excellent comple-
mentary techniques in the study of faceting. STM
provides structural information down to the atomic
scale. The resolution of LEEM does not match that
of an STM; however, it does have several advan-
tages that make it a most useful tool in studying the
kinetics of large scale morphological transformations:
convenience, the capability of imaging surfaces at
very high temperatures, and the fact that the sur-
face is easily accessible to observation during metal
deposition.
