Abstract
A quantitative investigation of the stacking and structure of ultrathin ®lms of Pt deposited on a Cu (1 1 1) surface
has been carried out by a combination of real space low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and low energy electron diraction
(LEED) techniques. At room temperature, Pt grew epitaxially on Cu (1 1 1) in the layer-by-layer mode. The Pt ®lms
have the regular fcc stacking up to 5 Monolayers (ML) determined by measuring the incident angle dependence asso-
ciated with shadowing eects. The thermal treatment of the Pt ®lms (from monolayer up to ®ve layers) triggered the Pt
diusion and mixing with the Cu substrate to form a Cu3Pt (1 1 1)-like surface alloy over at least three atomic lay-
ers.

1. Introduction
There have been numerous experiments on the
growth of thin metal ®lms on single crystal metal
substrates due to the great technological impor-
tance as well as the fundamental interest. In order
to obtain a detailed understanding of the physical
and chemical properties of these ®lms, knowledge
of the surface structure of thin ®lms is a prerequi-
site. This allows one to look at systematic dier-
ence between related systems, and also provides
model systems against which theoretical calcula-
tions can be tested.
Recently, the growth of Pt on Cu (1 1 1) has
been investigated experimentally with a variety of
surface-sensitive techniques by the two French
groups [1,2]. These authors concluded from their
data that the growth was layer-by-layer at room
temperature. A surface alloy, presumably Cu3Pt,
was evidenced by annealing at  600 K. In this ar-
ticle, we present results of low energy ion scatter-
ing (LEIS) and low energy electron diraction
(LEED) studies of thin Pt ®lms on Cu (1 1 1)
grown at 300 K and the formation of a Cu3Pt
(1 1 1)-like phase by annealing. LEIS is a highly
surface sensitive technique, which is particularly

well suited to investigating surface, interface and
thin ®lm phenomena [3±5].
2. Experimental
Our angle resolved ion scattering system (VSW
Scienti®c Instruments) and other standard tech-
niques for surface preparation and characterisa-
tion have been described previously [6]. The base
pressure in the UHV chamber was  7  10ÿ11
mbar after bakeout, and rose to 4 ´ 10ÿ10 mbar
during evaporation. The scattered ions were ener-
gy analysed by a hemispherical electrostatic ana-
lyser with multichannel detection.
The Cu (1 1 1) crystal was oriented within 0.5°
and was cleaned following standard procedures
[1]. The surface cleanliness and crystallographic
ordering were veri®ed by 1 keV He LEIS and
LEED. Platinum was sublimated via a home-built
evaporator source at a rate of  0:008 monolayers
(ML) per second onto the substrate at room tem-
perature. The monolayer completion was calibrat-
ed with LEIS by measuring the ®lm signal as a
function of Pt deposition time in conditions where
no dissolution of Pt into the Cu (1 1 1) substrate
takes place. The Pt was removed by Ar ion bom-
bardment and annealing after each measurement.
3. Results and discussion
To investigate the growth behaviour of thin Pt
®lms on Cu (1 1 1) we measured the Pt signals as
a function of the incident angle a along the two
most important azimuthal directions at which dif-
ferent shadowing features should occur depending
on the coverage. Fig. 1(a) and (b) shows the a
scans (measured from the plane of the surface) of
the Pt signals along the [1 
2 1] and [
1 
1 2] azi-
muths respectively. The general feature for sub-
monolayer coverage along the [1 
2 1] and [
1 
1 2]
azimuths is the same, resulting in an increase in
the ®rst Pt shadowing peak ac  16 with in-
creasing Pt coverages. This is due to the ®rst over-
layer Pt shadowing of the ®rst overlayer Pt. At 1
ML, the ®rst Pt shadowing peak becomes pro-
nounced. There are no extra Pt shadowing features
appearing at higher incident angles at monolayer
coverage, indicating the 2-D growth of the ®rst
Pt overlayer. With increasing coverages, the signif-
icant dierent shadowing features at higher inci-
dent angles appear along the two azimuths.
Along the [1 
2 1] azimuth (Fig. 1(a)) the second
and third shadowing edges (ac  31 and 74°) ap-
pear at Pt coverage of 1.6 ML and become pro-
nounced at a coverage of 3.2 ML. Note that near
the third shadowing peak at higher incident angles,
scattering from second and third layers is domi-
nant [7]. This observation is associated with the
completion of  3 ML Pt and agrees with layer-
by-layer growth up to a few layers [1,2]. In con-
trast, along the [
1 
1 2] azimuth (Fig. 1(b)) a second
critical angle of ac  54 appears at higher cover-
ages. These features are consistent with the conclu-
sion
that
the
Pt
®lms
have
the
regular
ABCABC . . . stacking of the fcc structure. The
ABAB . . . stacking of the hcp structure can be ex-
cluded. In addition, the presence of the 3.2 ML Pt
overlayers also results in the disappearance of the
three Cu shadowing peaks in the Cu a scans (not
shown), indicating that there are few Cu atoms
in the top three layers. For 5 ML Pt, the a scan

also shows fcc shadowing features. We conclude
that Pt ®lms grow in a well-oriented fcc (1 1 1)
structure upto at least 5 ML without any observ-
able hcp stacking contributions. This conclusion
has been con®rmed by comparing the experimental
shadowing features with those obtained by 3-D
computer simulation in the a scans along both
[1 
2 1] and [
1 
1 2] azimuths (not shown).
The ordering and symmetry of thin Pt ®lms up
to 5 ML have also been determined by both ob-
serving the LEED pattern positions and by moni-
toring the Pt signals obtained at grazing incidence.
The (1 ´ 1) LEED pattern was observed for room
temperature Pt deposition independent of cover-
age. For coverage up to  1 ML, a threefold sym-
metry of the fcc structure remained unchanged,
indicating a quasi-epitaxial growth. At 3 ML Pt,
we detected  3% change of the position of the
®rst order beams (at ®xed energy), which is in
agreement with the large mismatch ( 8:7%) of
Cu and Pt lattices. At 5 ML Pt, the (1 ´ 1) LEED
pattern shows slightly broader spots and higher
background as compared to the clean Pt (1 1 1),
revealing a Pt (1 1 1)-like structure (see the LEED
patterns in Fig. 2).
Fig. 2(a) shows energy and angle dispersive
LEIS distributions (raw data) of the azimuthal an-
gle / scan at grazing incidence, collected from the
5 ML Pt ®lm surface. For comparison, the / scan
from the clean Pt (1 1 1) surface under the same
scattering geometrical conditions is shown in
Fig. 2(b). The deep and wide minimum centred
at /  0° indicates the shortest interatomic spacing
between surface Pt atoms in the [0 
1 1] azimuth.
The

at around
/  )30° and 30° result from the next shortest in-
teratomic spacings along the [1 
2 1] and [
1 
1 2] az-
imuths. The agreement between the ®lm and Pt
(1 1 1) shadowing dips con®rms a Pt (1 1 1)-like
structure of the 5 ML Pt ®lm, in agreement with
our LEED observations.
In order to determine the Pt±Pt nearest-neigh-
bour (NN) atomic spacing of the Pt layers, the crit-
ical angles ac (measured at 80% of maximum
intensity [6]) have been measured along both
[1 
2 1] and [
1 
1 2] azimuths during the growth of
the ®rst ®ve layers. Using a Thomas±Fermi±Mo-
liere (TFM) potential with screening length of
0.92aF for Li scattered from Pt [6], the NN values
obtained as a function of the Pt monolayers are
shown in Fig. 3. The values are based upon mea-

5 ML Pt ®lm and Pt (1 1 1) are also shown in the ®gure.

surements made at ®ve dierent scattering angles
between 90° and 130° and procedures described
previously [6,7]. The quoted error indicates the rel-
ative precision of the measurement. The analysis
using the Ziegler±Biersack±Littmark (ZBL) poten-
tial yields NN values within 10%, roughly indi-
cating
the
uncertainty
due
to
the
scattering
potential. During the growth of the ®rst monolay-
er the lattice parameter, within an experimental
uncertainty, basically equals to that of pure Cu
(2.56 
A). This result demonstrates the ®rst Pt ®lm
is in a normal registry position. Beyond the mono-
layer coverage, the lattice parameter increases sig-
ni®cantly up to 2.73 
A (close to the normal Pt NN
value of 2.77 
A) at 5 ML. These results are consis-
tent with a previous determination by RHEED [2].
Fig. 4 shows the typical a scans along the
[1 
2 1] azimuth for deposition of 3.2 ML Pt on
Cu (1 1 1) followed by annealing at 573 K. The a
scans measured for the Cu3Pt (1 1 1) bulk alloy
surface under the same scattering conditions are
also shown in the ®gure as references. The id-
entical shadowing features of the Pt and Cu signals
compared to those of Cu3Pt (1 1 1) are observed,
supporting the formation of a Cu3Pt-like phase
at this temperature. A close inspection of scattered
Pt and Cu signals near the third shadowing peaks
(where scattering from second and third layers is
dominant) in the a scans compared to those of
Cu3Pt (1 1 1) strongly suggests that there are at
least three layers of Cu3Pt. Repeated measure-
ments involving several dierent Pt coverages be-
tween 1 ML and 5 ML upon annealing showed
that the surface alloy formed is always of Cu3Pt-
type. Neither CuPt (1 1 1) nor CuPt3 (1 1 1) sur-
face phase has been evidenced in this study.
The thermodynamical criterion based upon sur-
face energies has been traditionally established for
predicting the growth mode [8]. In most cases,
however, thin ®lms are obtained under experimen-
tal conditions far from thermodynamical equilibri-
um. The ®lm growth and resulting morphologies
will then be governed by kinetic eects. From a
thermodynamical point of view, the large positive
surface energy dierence between platinum and
copper cPt ÿ cCu > 0 should favour a 3-D cluster
growth for Pt on Cu (1 1 1). However, this was not
observed in this work and in previous studies [1,2].
It seems that the growth of metastable Pt overlay-
ers on Cu (1 1 1) may be possible under some con-
ditions due to kinetic limitations. In order to
enable the layer-by-layer growth, interlayer mass
transport must be fast enough to allow atoms to
leave the tops of islands or clusters immediately af-
ter they arrive. The strong tendency of the Pt over-
layer towards an epitaxial-growth evidenced by
LEED and LEIS re¯ects its relatively strong Pt±
Cu interaction. We believe that the arriving
``hot'' Pt atoms at room temperature have su-
ciently high mobility to obtain their quasi-equilib-
rium 2-D con®guration, while the true equilibrium
con®guration would correspond to an interdif-
fused Pt±Cu alloy. The experimental observation
that an fcc stacking sequence is adopted implies
strong Pt±Pt interactions. This is in agreement
with previous conclusions that Pt grows layer-by-
layer at least up to several layers [1,2].

By ion scattering it is found that the Pt NN val-
ue (compressed by 7%) is close to that of pure Cu,
indicating that the ®rst overlayer Pt atoms are in
normal registry positions. With increasing cover-
ages, the transition from the Cu bound distance
to the equilibrium Pt bound distance occurs (not
abrupt). At 5 ML, a Pt (1 1 1)-like structure is
formed. This ®nding has been further con®rmed
by our LEED data. Our annealing results reveal
that Pt ®lms on Cu (1 1 1) undergo intermixing
with the substrate at moderate temperatures. Un-
der appropriate annealing conditions  573 K,
this leads to the formation of a stable surface alloy.
The results strongly suggest that the stoichiometry
of the surface alloy formed is Cu3Pt. A compari-
son of the Pt and Cu a scans between a surface al-
loy and Cu3Pt (1 1 1) bulk alloy indicates that
there are at least three layers of Cu3Pt. It should
be mentioned that evidence for surface long-range
ordering of the Cu3Pt (1 1 1) surface alloy was not
observed during the whole course of the experi-
ment. The reason for the absence of the predicted
p(2 ´ 2) LEED pattern is not clear.
4. Conclusion
We have shown that the incident angle depen-
dence associated with shadowing eects at special
geometrical conditions using low energy alkali
ion scattering can be used to monitor in detail
the stacking sequence in the growth of fcc Pt on
Cu (1 1 1) upto 5 ML. This technique with a com-
bination of LEED provides unambiguous layer-
by-layer monitoring of the stacking sequence,
and can determine precisely the thickness of the
growing ®lms, and the distances and orientations
between surface NN atoms. We have also revealed
that from monolayer to 5 ML coverage a Cu3Pt
(1 1 1)-like surface alloy is formed upon annealing
at 573 K.
