ABSTRACT
By means of first principles simulations we demonstrate that tiny deviations from stoichiometry in the bulk composition of the
N
i
P
t
−
L

ordered alloy have a great impact on the atomic configuration of the (111) surface. We predict that at
T

K
the (111) surface of the
N

and

alloys corresponds to the (111) truncation of the bulk
L

ordered structure. However, the (111) surface of the nickel deficient
N

alloy is strongly enriched by Pt and should exhibit the pattern of the
2

structure. Such a drastic change in the segregation behavior is due to the presence of different antisite defects in the Ni- and Pt-rich alloys and is a manifestation of the so-called off-stoichiometric effect.
