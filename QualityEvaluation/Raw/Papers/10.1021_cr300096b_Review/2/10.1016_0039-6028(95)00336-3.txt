Abstract 
We present first results on the formation of a surface alloy starting from the deposition of thin Cu films on a Pt(lll) 
substrate. Annealing at 300°C leads to the kinetic blocking of the dissolution process. We have used synchrotron radiation to 
measure the Pt 4f7/2 core-level shifts due to the alloying process. We estimate the Pt concentration in the surface layer to be 
50%. These results are compared to previous work on the Pt/Cu(lll) system which demonstrated the formation of a Cu3Pt 
surface alloy. The influence of surface segregation and bulk alloying in driving the formation of a surface-alloy phase during 
dissolution is discussed.

1. Introduction 
The study of binary surface-alloy formation by 
annealing of thin metallic films on a single-crystal 
substrate is important from several points of view. A 
series of technological applications, e.g. in catalysis 
and magnetic recording [1-4], means that these novel 
systems are particularly attractive. The study of 
model systems allows us to understand which param- 
eters need to be controlled to produce such alloys. 
From a fundamental point of view we can obtain 
some insight into the basic physical processes in- 
volved in the formation of a surface alloy by study- 
ing well-chosen systems. 
It has been shown that a particular surface com-

pound can be related to an energy balance. There is a 
competition or synergy between three effects [5,6]: 
the relative surface energies, the mixing enthalpy and 
the relative size effects. Under certain conditions the 
kinetics of the dissolution of a (finite) thin film into 
an (infinite) single crystal may be slowed down or 
even blocked due to the local, i.e. near-surface, 
interaction of these three effects. The result is called 
a surface alloy. 
It follows that for a binary system AB it matters 
whether we deposit A on B or vice versa. With this 
in mind we have studied the CuPt system. In this 
paper we present results obtained on the Cu/Pt(lll) 
system and compare them with a previous study of 
the Pt/Cu(lll) surface, using core-level photoemis- 
sion spectroscopy (PES) and synchrotron radiation. 
Shek et al. have already studied the growth of 
Cu/Pt(lll) [7]. They have shown that the Cu over-

layer follows a layer-by-layer growth mode. They 
find no evidence for charge transfer between the Pt 
substrate and the Cu overlayer. Once the first Cu 
layer is completed the Pt surface peak is completely 
extinguished leaving a single bulk peak, with a peak 
maximum at a binding energy of 70.90 eV.

binding energy (eV) 
The preparation of the single-crystal Cu and 
Pt(lll) samples has already been described in detail 
elsewhere [8]; the same in-situ cleaning procedure 
was used for both Cu and Pt. 
Surface core-level photoelectron spectroscopy was 
carried out using synchrotron radiation at the Super- 
ACO storage ring, Orsay, France. The SA73b beam- 
line with a TGM (600 lines/mm) 7 
° and an experi- 
mental PES apparatus previously described was used. 
The Pt4f7/2 PES results on Pt/Cu(lll) were 
obtained using an incident photon energy of 155 eV. 
This corresponds to a Cooper minimum for the Pt, 
thus for the Cu/Pt(lll) measurements we have used 
a lower photon energy of 115 eV. The Fermi level is 
thus more easily measurable. The overall energy 
resolution (monochromator and electron analyser 
combined) was 320 and 200 meV, respectively. Peak 
heights typically between 5000 and 10000 counts 
were recorded. 
3. Results 
The PES results on the Pt/Cu(lll) system have 
already been presented in detail elsewhere [8]. Here 
we will concentrate on the Cu/Pt(lll) results and 
compare them with the salient points of the 
Pt/Cu(lll) study. There are three sections, first the 
reference spectra used to determine the fit parame- 
ters, secondly the Cu/Pt(lll) dissolution results and 
thirdly a reminder of the Pt/Cu(lll) results. Cu 
overlayer thicknesses were calibrated in situ using 
AES and a quartz balance.

115 eV. The binding energy scale was determined by 
measuring the position of the Fermi level. The spec- 
tra were normalised with respect to the background 
level at a fixed energy from the peak maximum on 
the low binding energy side. The RAINBOW analy- 
sis program was used. A continuous "stepped" 
background (Shirley-type) [9] was subtracted. Do- 
niach-Sunjic lineshapes [10] were fitted, broadened 
by a Gaussian instrument function. The lineshape 
parameters were as follows: asymmetry a = 0.19; 
Lorentzian width 2,/= 0.5 eV. This gave two peaks 
at binding energies of 70.14 (bulk B 0) and 70.73 eV 
(surface So). The measured surface core-level shift 
was therefore 410 meV, in agreement with previous 
values [7,11-13]. 
Fig. 2a shows the Pt 4f7/2 spectra obtained before 
and after a CO adsorption of 12 Langmuir units on a 
well-annealed Cu/Pt(lll) surface. The sample was 
annealed at 300°C until no further change was ob- 
served in the Pt 4f7/2 intensity. The difference spec- 
trum clearly shows the surface component, attenu- 
ated by the CO adsorption, and the displaced surface 
peak due to the Pt-CO environment. The position of 
the surface component allows us to deduce the posi- 
tion of the bulk peak by subtraction. These positions 
serve as first guesses in fitting the spectrum of the 
clean annealed surface. We obtain bulk (B*) and 
surface (S*) peaks at 70.95 and 70.63 eV, as shown 
in Fig. 2b. The best fit was obtained for an asymme- 
try parameter of 0.11, compared with 0.19 for pure 
Pt. This change has already been observed for a PtCo

3.2. Annealing of Cu / Pt(lll) at 300°C 
An annealing temperature of 300°C was chosen, 
being the lowest temperature at which a significant 
change in the AES Cu and Pt intensities is observed. 
The evolution of the surface and bulk Pt4f7/z 
core levels as a function of annealing time of 2.1 ML 
Cu/Pt(lll) is shown in Fig. 3. The total Pt intensity 
increases over the first 20 minutes of annealing, 
followed by a region where the intensity rises more 
slowly. The slight decrease after 70 minutes is prob-

which is absent before annealing, increases rapidly 
before stabilising. There is a corresponding decrease 
in the intensity of the bulk peak B*. The relative 
surface intensity (with respect to that measured off 
the clean Pt(lll) surface) is about 0.5 at the end of 
the annealing process. The core-level binding ener- 
gies for S* and B* averaged over ten spectra are 
(70.60 _ 0.08) eV and (70.97 + 0.06) eV, respec- 
tively. This gives a surface-alloy shift of 230 meV 
and a bulk-alloy shift of 170 meV. 
We have also measured the alloy shift as a func- 
tion of initial Cu coverage after 10 minutes anneal-

ing at 300°C, shown in Fig. 4. There is a clear 
correlation between the alloy shift and the Cu over- 
layer thickness. After 10 minutes the interdiffusion is 
already well underway, although from Fig. 3 the 
surface-alloy phase is not yet stabilised. 
3.3. Annealing of Pt / Cu(lll) at 315°C [8] 
We show in Fig. 5 the evolution of the total, 
surface and bulk Pt4fT/2 core-level intensities as a 
function of annealing time. The initial evolution in 
the Pt intensity is much more rapid than in the case 
of Cu/Pt(lll). 
The peak intensities soon stabilise 
after a few minutes annealing. The S* and B* 
core-level binding energies thus measured are 70.64 
and 71.0 eV, respectively. This gives a bulk-alloy 
shift of 150 meV. The relative Pt surface intensity is 
0.25 after annealing. 
The surface intensities measured for different 
overlayer thicknesses of Cu/Pt(111) and Pt/Cu(111) 
are summarised in Table 1.

4. Discussion 
Fig. 3 shows that the evolution of the Pt4f7/2 
intensity during dissolution occurs in two stages. 
Firstly there is a rapid increase in the overall inten- 
sity indicating interdiffusion between the overlayer 
and the Pt substrate. This results in a higher Pt 
concentration in the surface region. Secondly, after 
about 20 minutes the Pt intensity as a function of 
time flattens out, indicating very little further inter- 
diffusion. 
The behaviour of the individual components of 
the Pt line gives further evidence for such non-classi- 
cal dissolution kinetics. The surface peak S * appears 
almost immediately on annealing, demonstrating the 
presence of Pt atoms in the surface layer, and evolves 
rapidly towards a steady-state level. The bulk peak 
exhibits a corresponding rapid initial decrease. 
Thus, the chemical environment of the Pt atoms 
changes rapidly at the beginning of the dissolution 
process, but after 20 minutes it is stable. We can say 
that the kinetics have been blocked and a relatively 
stable surface alloy has been formed. 
The surface layer composition of this alloy may 
be estimated from a measure of the relative surface 
intensity. By assuming that photoelectron diffraction 
effects do not vary greatly between S o and S* for 
normal emission we obtain a Pt surface concentra- 
tion of c o. For the bulk peak we obtain a similar 
value. However, in the latter case we cannot neglect 
diffraction effects and at best this gives a first esti- 
mate of the subsurface Pt concentration in the sur- 
face alloy. Furthermore, by assuming a homoge- 
neous alloy we may also estimate the extent of the 
surface alloy to be 4-5 ML. 
In Fig. 4 we indicate the Pt surface concentration 
c o for the different bulk-alloy shifts measured on 
B*. By assuming that c o gives an indication of the 
overall surface-alloy composition we have a measure 
of the concentration dependence of the alloy shift. 
Notice that the bulk-alloy shift for the CusoPts0 
alloy has been measured to be 150 meV [8], support- 
ing the hypothesis of a surface alloy with a similar 
composition. We cannot, however, say anything 
about the form of the concentration dependence of 
the alloy shift. As in the case of Pt/Cu(lll), it may 
well be that the alloy shift is fairly constant over a 
wide concentration range, with significant variations

only for very dilute or very concentrated alloys. 
From the 
annealing 
experiment on 2.1 
ML 
Cu/Pt(lll) the mobility of the Cu atoms allows a 
penetration of about four or five monolayers. It is 
therefore not surprising for the higher initial Cu 
overlayer thickness of 4.2 ML that, after annealing, 
we observe only very few Pt atoms in the surface 
layer, as shown in Table 1. Conversely, a small 
initial Cu concentration of 0.4 ML appears insuffi- 
cient to stabilise a CusoPts0-type surface alloy and 
thus leads to a much greater dilution of the Cu into 
the Pt substrate. The surface alloy formed during the 
dissolution process depends on both the energy bal- 
ance and the initial overlayer thickness. 
By comparing the dissolution kinetics in Figs. 3 
and 5 we notice some important differences. For 
Pt/Cu(111) the interdiffusion is much more rapid. 
Furthermore, the Pt overlayer penetrates deeper into 
the substrate, between 10 and 20 ML. Finally, the 
surface alloy thus formed is of Cu3Pt-type. On the 
other hand, in the case of Cu/Pt(lll) the interdiffu- 
sion is much slower, and the surface alloy thus 
formed, for a similar Cu overlayer thickness, extends 
over only 4 ML and has an average composition of 
Cus0 Pts0. 
These differences could be ascribed to the slightly 
different annealing temperatures. To check this we 
have used the known high-temperature diffusion co- 
efficients for Pt in Cu and Cu in Pt [15] to calculate 
the expected penetration depths of the overlayer into 
the substrate. For Pt/Cu(lll) we would expect 4.2 
.~ after 10 minutes at 315°C, whereas for Cu/Pt(lll) 
this gives 6 × 10 -1° .~. 
Thus, in both cases the measured extent of the 
surface alloy is significantly greater than that ex- 
pected if the chemical potential were the main driv- 
ing force. We therefore evoke the combined effects 
at the surface of segregation, size and alloying to 
explain the driving force behind the dissolution. In 
particular from the relative surface energies we would 
expect Cu segregation at the surface. Thus, in the 
case of Pt/Cu(lll) the inital driving force for inter- 
diffusion will be stronger than in the case of 
Cu/Pt(lll). This would explain the more dramatic 
evolution of the Pt intensities shown in Fig. 5. Once 
the initial interdiffusion has taken place it seems that 
other driving forces take over, in particular the alloy 
effect, localising the alloy in the near-surface region. 
In both cases the surface alloy formed corresponds to 
a stoichiometry characteristic of an ordered phase in 
the bulk (L12 for Pt/Cu(lll), L10 for Cu/Pt(lll) 
[16]). The role of the stable bulk-alloy phases ap- 
pears to be important in determining the surface-al- 
loy composition. The most stable bulk-alloy phase is 
in fact Cu3Pt. In the case of surface-alloy formation, 
we might expect Cu3Pt to be the preferred phase. 
However, for Cu/Pt(lll) it is the segregation be- 
haviour which leads immediately to the formation of 
a CusoPts0 surface phase. Given the limited, initial, 
Cu overlayer it is then impossible to return to a more 
Cu-rich alloy phase. 
5. Conclusion 
We have followed the dissolution of 2.1 ML 
Cu/Pt(lll) as a function of annealing time at 300°C, 
using surface core-level photoemission spectroscopy 
and synchrotron radiation. The dissolution kinetics 
are non-classical, driven by surface effects, and lead 
to the stabilising of a surface alloy of type CusoPts0. 
The alloy shift measured is 170 meV, close to that 
measured in the bulk Cus0Pt50 alloy. The alloy shift 
changes for very dilute alloys. For the inverse sys- 
tem, 2.5 ML Pt/Cu(lll), the surface alloy stabilises 
as Cu3 Pt.
