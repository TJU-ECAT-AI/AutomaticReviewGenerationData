PtSn {111} forms two ordered surface alloys namely p(2 6 2) and (!3 6 !3R30u) and such
bimetallic catalysts are often used in industrially catalysed reactions, such as hydrogenations, to
improve performance although the reasons behind the improvements are generally not well
understood. In this study density functional theory calculations have been performed for
hydrogen adsorption at various sites on Pt {111} and the ordered PtSn {111} surfaces in order to
characterise the differences between the pure and doped surfaces. The structural, bonding,
electronic and vibrational characteristics of each system are presented indicating that there are no
significant bonding differences when adsorption occurs at platinum sites on the surface. Where
adsorption occurs at a tin site on the doped surface the adsorption energy is negative or the
adsorption site changes to one involving only platinum atoms. Nudged elastic band calculations
were used to determine the barrier to diffusion of the hydrogen atoms on the surface. The
diffusion calculations show significant differences in the mobility of hydrogen providing a
possible explanation for the changes in catalytic action on tin doping of platinum.
Introduction
Although catalysts have been used since the middle ages in
ancient industries such as brewing, it was not until 1836 that
the definition of ‘‘catalysis’’ as a substance that facilitates a
reaction was introduced by Berzelius.1 Around this time a
systematic study of the influence of metals on simple reactions
began. It became clear that, quite apart from the effect on
reaction rates, different catalytic substances could lead to
different products giving the first indication that catalysts
could be used to selectively produce a desired product
while minimising the amount of undesired by-products. It
was 100 years later before scientists began to look at the
mechanisms for catalytic reactions.2 Since then both experi-
mental and computational methods have developed to a point
where we can now generate very detailed models for catalytic
reactions and intermediates. Using these models we can begin
to generate an understanding of the molecular basis for
observed selectivity.
The addition of a second metal to a surface will produce
large perturbations in the electronic structure of that surface
giving scope to fine tune the catalyst’s properties for the target
reaction. It is found that bimetallic catalysts often have
improved activity, selectivity and/or lifetimes compared to
their pure counterparts. There are two main ways the addition
of a second element affects catalysis. These are termed (1)
ligand effects and (2) ensemble effects. Ligand effects are
the changes in catalytic activity that occur because of the
electronic changes induced on the ‘‘host’’ metal by the presence
of the second metal in the surface. Ensemble effects refer to the
role of the second metal as site blockers. The presence of a
second, not catalytically active, metal reduces the number of
active sites at which catalysis can occur. Surface alloys fall into
two broad groups. Those that have the same basic composition
as the bulk, possibly with some reconstruction, and those that
form by surface segregation and have a different composition
to the bulk.
Hydrogen has been extensively studied on transition metal
surfaces; see for example references 3,4. With very few excep-
tions hydrogen is found to adsorb in a hollow site on the {111}
surfaces. As discussed below hydrogen adsorbed on platinum
is one of these exceptions. Dissociative adsorption of H2 on
metal surfaces is a very important step in hydrogenation
reactions. In general H2 dissociation is easy on transition metal
(TM) surfaces with the exception of Cu, Au and Ag. Naturally
the dissociation on a bimetallic surface will be affected by the
presence of the second metal. Addition of a second metal
generally raises the barrier to dissociation. In addition, where
dissociation occurs the TM–H bond is weaker than on the pure
transition metal surface. A distinction is sometimes drawn
between alloying with another TM and a main group metal but
hydrogenation on PtFex produces very similar results to PtSnx
suggesting that any element which is more electropositive may
enhance the selectivity.5
Hydrogenation reactions are one very important class
of industrially catalysed reactions where we would like to
control the product distribution. Traditionally platinum or
palladium based catalysts have been used but these are rather
aggressive catalysts usually leading to complete hydrogenation
of every double bond in the target molecule. It has been
observed that the addition of a second metal such as
ruthenium, iron or tin can change the product distributions.
The different properties of bimetallic catalysts, compared to
the pure metals, will affect the chemistry that is observed.
There are a wealth of reviews describing the unique properties
of bimetallic surfaces and the effect these have on the catalytic
properties of metals.6–9

Tin doped platinum catalysts are used for reforming and
cracking in the petroleum industry as their lifetimes far exceed
those of pure platinum catalysts. They also have the advantage
of not requiring pre-sulfurisation. Another major application
is in direct oxidation in methanol fuel cells.10 In laboratory
studies the tin is generally found in the surface layer only and
the bulk material is pure platinum. Such tin doped surface
alloys have been studied in detail by Overbury and Ku.11
Simulation methods
Our calculations have been performed using periodic density
functional theory (DFT), as implemented in the code VASP
(Vienna Ab initio Simulation Program.12 The exchange-
correlation functional is approximated using the Perdew–
Wang
1991
(PW91)
generalised
gradient
approximation
(GGA).13 The use of periodic boundary conditions allows
the expansion of the wavefunctions of the valence electrons
in terms of a plane wave basis set which has a number of
advantages. The forces on the atoms can be easily calculated
using the Hellmann–Feynman theorem14,15 and are used to
perform a quasi Newton relaxation of the ions until the forces
are converged to less than 0.005 eV A
˚ 21. In addition the plane
wave basis set does not suffer from basis set superposition
error (BSSE) as long as all calculations are performed within
the same size cell (same basis set).
The projector augmented plane wave (PAW) method of
Blo
¨chl16,17 is applied, with a plane wave cut-off energy of
400 eV and an augmentation cut-off of 645 eV. In this
approach the wavefunctions are composed of plane waves that
are augmented by orbital-like functions centred on the atoms.
The smooth part describes the interstitial region well while
the inclusion of the augmentation functions ensures the proper
nodal structure close to the nuclei. The core for tin and for
platinum is [Kr].
The phase combinations of the orbitals within adjacent unit
cells (the extended electronic states) were represented by the
introduction of phase factors into the wavefunctions at a
series of k-points in reciprocal space. The k-points were
obtained using the Monkhorst–Pack18 scheme with conver-
gence of the total energy with respect to k-point sampling
accelerated using second order Methfessel–Paxton smearing19
with a smearing width of 0.1 eV.
The adsorption energy of H on the {111} surface (Eads)
is calculated by comparing the energy of the adsorbed atom
(E(H/{111})) with that of the free surface (E{111}) and half the
energy of the gas phase molecule (EH2) from:
Eads~{ EH=f111g{ Ef111gz1

The adsorption energy is therefore the heat evolved on
adsorption and will be positive for favourable interactions.
The values for adsorption energies in this work are always
expressed as kJ mol21 of adsorbate atoms.

in

on
adsorption the differential charge density (Dr) was calculated
from
Dr~rf111g=H{ rf111gzrH

(2)
where r{111}/H, rH and r{111} are the charge densities for
the adsorbed total system, isolated hydrogen atom and the
{111} slab with the geometry it adopts when H is adsorbed,
respectively.
To calculate the vibrational frequencies the harmonic
approximation is used, whereby the normal mode vibrational
frequencies were calculated by diagonalisation of the mass-
weighted second derivative matrix. The second derivative
matrix is generated from a set of single point calculations
where each hydrogen atom is sequentially displaced from
its equilibrium position by a small amount in the x, y and z
directions.
The nudged elastic band method allows calculation of
the minimum energy path for an atomic rearrangement.20
In this study the rearrangement in question is the diffusion
of hydrogen on a metal surface. The maximum of the
diffusion energy profile gives the activation energy barrier to
the diffusion. The method begins by defining two point
boundary conditions. These are the high symmetry adsorption
sites
determined
using
the
standard

method. A chain of images (the elastic band) is then generated
by linear interpolation between the two endpoints with a
spring between each image. These images are optimised
simultaneously with the constraint that they remain equidi-
stant from each other. Both the hydrogen and the surface
are relaxed.
Structure of Pt {111} and PtSn {111}
The calculated lattice constant for platinum, 3.958 A
˚ , is in
reasonable agreement with the experimental value of 3.924 A
˚ .
The {111} surface of platinum is represented using the slab
methodology in which a slab of material is generated by
introducing a vacuum gap perpendicular to the surface in a
3 dimensional periodic cell. In this study we employ both
p(2 6 2) and (!3 6 !3)R30u surface unit cells with a hydrogen
atom adsorbed on both sides of the slab giving surface
coverages of J and M respectively. A large vacuum gap of
23 A
˚ was introduced to ensure that the adsorbates on both
sides of the surface did not interact.
The {111} surface is close packed for the fcc metals so very
little relaxation is expected for the Pt {111} surface. All atoms
in the slab were allowed to relax during the calculations and
for the clean surface the interlayer spacing was found to
increase from 2.285 A
˚ in the bulk to 2.306 A
˚ for the layer1–
layer2 (d12) separation on the relaxed surface. This represents
a 0.9% expansion in agreement with experimental LEED
measurements.21 There was a contraction of 1.1% for the d23
spacing.
Platinum and tin form two ordered surface alloys as shown
in Fig. 1. For the first surface there is 1 tin atom for every 3
surface platinum atoms with a p(2 6 2) structure. A surface
with a higher Pt : Sn ratio of 2 : 1 and a (!3 6 !3)R30u
structure can also form.8 These 3 : 1 and 2 : 1 surface ratios can
be obtained by deposition of Sn onto pure Pt {111} surfaces in
which the subsurface layers remain pure platinum. A surface
layer with a tin content of 0.33 has been observed on several
other metals with the ordered (!3 6 !3)R30u structure found
in each case.

In this work the PtSn surfaces were produced by substituting
one of the platinum atoms in the pure Pt surface with a tin
atom. This substitution was made on both sides of a 5 layer
slab to prevent the formation of a slab dipole. To ensure the slab
was large enough a 7 layer slab was tested. The surface energy
was converged within 2% of the value for the 5 layer slab.
Due to the large size of the tin, the doped surface is not
planar, with the tin atoms out of the plane. From our
calculations, when the surfaces are fully relaxed the tin sticks
0.285 A
˚ out of the surface for the (2 6 2) surface and 0.226 A
˚
for the (!3 6 !3R30u) surface. This results in Pt–Sn distances
of 2.835 A
˚ for (2 6 2) and 2.829 A
˚ for the (!3 6 !3R30u)
surfaces. To balance the outward movement of the tin
atoms the platinums in the surface contract by 0.045 A
˚
for the (!3 6 !3R30u) surface. This is accompanied by an
expansion of d23 by 0.053 A
˚ . This is the opposite direction of
expansion/compression compared to the pure Pt {111} surface.
There is very little change in the (2 6 2) layer spacing.
Pick modelled the {111} surface of the Pt3Sn surface alloy
using a tight-binding linear-muffin-tin-orbital atomic sphere
approximation.22 For the surface alloys the d12 layer spacing
was unchanged for the platinum atoms but the tin protruded
0.30 A
˚ (2 6 2) and 0.23 A
˚ (!3 6 !3R30u) out of the surface in
good agreement with our results. Overbury and Ku obtained a
larger displacement for Sn of 0.39 A
˚ for the (!3 6 !3R30u)
PtSn{111} system.11
The surface energy for the pure platinum surface is 1.2 J m21
which rises to 2.0 J m21 for the (2 6 2) PtSn surface and
2.3 J m21 for the (!3 6 !3R30u) PtSn case.
We have also considered the electronic structure of the Pt
and PtSn {111} surfaces. Pt has the largest electron affinity of
the group 10 elements and on this basis we would assume that
when Sn is added to the surface Pt would act as an electron
acceptor. In addition, adding a second element will decrease
the strength of the Pt–Pt interactions (because there are less
Pt–Pt bonds) and so will decrease the width of the 5d band.23
Fig. 2 shows the surface layer platinum d band for the pure
and both doped surfaces. The band width decreases from
6.36 eV for the pure surface to 5.42 eV when one quarter of the
platinums are replaced by tin atoms and is further reduced to
5.19 eV when one third of the surface atoms are replaced by
tin. The d-band is also shifted lower in energy away from the
Fermi level with increasing tin concentration. These effects are
likely to have consequences for the strength of adsorption of
reactants on the surface.
Hydrogen adsorption on Pt {111} and PtSn {111}
Four starting positions were considered for hydrogen adsorp-
tion on the pure platinum surface as shown in Fig. 3. The atop
position has a hydrogen atom sitting directly above the centre
of a surface platinum atom. The hcp mode places the hydrogen
in a hollow site, triangulated by three surface platinums. There
is a platinum in the second layer below the hydrogen. Similarly
the fcc mode hydrogen is in a hollow site but this time the
platinum below it is in the third layer. The bridge mode places
the hydrogen half way between two adjacent platinums.
Tin doping produces a more complicated surface and hence
more adsorption sites were considered for hydrogen on the

PtSn {111} surface as shown in Fig. 4(a) for PtSn (2 6 2)
{111} and Fig. 4(b) for PtSn (!3 6 !3R30u) {111}. The
nomenclature becomes somewhat more complicated with the
need to specify which type of atoms are involved in the adsorp-
tion mode. For example a bridging mode can be bridgePtPt
where the atom is midway between two platinum atoms or
bridgePtSn where the adsorption occurs between a platinum
and a tin atom. The four adsorption modes on the Pt {111}
surface give rise to 8 adsorption modes on the PtSn (2 6 2)
surface and 6 modes on the PtSn (!3 6 !3)R30u surface.
Adsorption energies
The adsorption energies for hydrogen on Pt {111}, as shown
in Table 1, are insensitive to the adsorption site with less than
4 kJ mol21 difference between the most strongly adsorbed
(atopPt) and the weakest adsorption studied (hcp site). The
difference is similar for the (!3 6 !3R30u) coverage but the
order of stability has changed with the bridge mode the most
stable, but again the hcp is the least strongly adsorbed.
Comparing the (2 6 2) coverage with the (!3 6 !3R30u)
concentration, for each adsorption mode, the higher concen-
tration results in a slightly stronger adsorption. The increase is
most significant for the bridge adsorption mode where it
increases from 43 to 52 kJ mol21 on moving from a quarter to
a third of a monolayer.
These results are in agreement with previous studies by
Greeley and Mavrikakis,3 Hong et al.24 and Watson et al.25,26
Greeley and Mavrikakis used a four layer system and only
relaxed two of the layers. They did however use a (2 6 2)
coverage so their results can be compared with the present
work for this coverage. Their adsorption energies are slightly
lower than ours although they show the same insensitivity to
adsorption site. They also tested both the Perdew–Wang 91
and revised Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof functionals with
a small change in the relative energies for different sites.
Watson et al. used an ultrasoft pseudopotential approach on a
fixed three layer slab25 and on relaxed 3 and 5 layer slabs26
giving rise to similar results to those presented here with
adsorption energies largely insensitive to the adsorption site.
The adsorption energies calculated by Hong et al. for a 1 ML
coverage are similar to those for a (2 6 2) coverage.24 The
experimental values for hydrogen adsorption on Pt {111}
range from 29 to 90 kJ mol21.27–29 The experimental values
cover a very wide range of values making comparisons to the
calculated values difficult.
Although every adsorption mode in Fig. 4 was considered
for hydrogen on PtSn surfaces in this work, only 5 were local
minima on the (2 6 2) surface and three for the (!3 6 !3R30u)
system. The remaining sites relaxed to neighbouring sites. The
local minima were atopSn, atopPt, bridgePtPt, fccPtPtPt and

hcpPtPtPt for PtSn {111} (2 6 2) and atopSn, atopPt and
bridgePtPt for PtSn {111} (!3 6 !3R30u). With the exception
of adsorption directly on top of a tin atom all modes involving
an interaction with a tin atom resulted in the hydrogen moving
away from the tin to an adsorption mode involving only
platinum surface atoms.
Adsorption on the atopSn site (regardless of coverage)
results in a negative adsorption energy. This means that the
adsorbed system is less stable than compared to the same
surface and a hydrogen in vacuum but that there exists an
energetic barrier to desorption. The unfavourable interaction
with tin is clearly seen on the PtSn (!3 6 !3R30u) surface
which has no three-fold sites with only platinums. For this
surface both the hcpPtPtSn and fccPtPtSn relaxed into
neighbouring sites away from the tin. Similar behaviour is
observed for the PtPtSn hollow sites on the (2 6 2) surface.
The (2 6 2) atopSn site is less stable than the higher coverage.
The adsorption energies for the atopPt sites on the doped
surfaces are somewhat less than those for the pure platinum
surface. In particular for the (!3 6 !3R30u) surface the
adsorption energy drops by over 12 kJ mol21 with the
introduction of the tin. For this coverage the bridgePtPt
mode is also weaker on the doped surface by 10 kJ mol21. For
the other adsorption modes the differences are much less.
There is surprisingly little difference in the adsorption
energies on the doped and pure surfaces for the threefold
hollow sites. The strength of the adsorption has been measured
experimentally for a J coverage on the Pt {111} and the PtSn
(2 6 2) {111} surfaces, giving adsorption energies of 29 to
90 and 69 kJ mol21 respectively. Experimentally determined
adsorption energies were considerably less on the (!3 6
!3R30u) PtSn surface with a value of 28 kJ mol21 measured for
deuterium adsorption.28 D rather than H adsorption is studied
experimentally as H2 does not thermally dissociate on PtSn
surface alloys under UHV conditions.
Structure
The atom–closest surface neighbour distance is sufficient to
characterise the structure for adsorption of a single atom.
Table 2 gives the Pt–H (or Sn–H) nearest distances for each
of the systems studied. For the Pt {111} (2 6 2) surface the
atopPt mode has the shortest Pt–H which then increases as you
go from the atopPt through the bridge mode and is longest for
the threefold hollow sites. There is little difference between the
hcp and fcc Pt–H values. This is consistent with the constant
interaction strength (adsorption energy) and increasing coor-
dination as the individual Pt–H interactions become weaker.
Increasing the coverage to 0.33 on the Pt {111} surface
increases the Pt–H distances a little. This is somewhat
surprising as the adsorption energies were found to increase
with this increase in coverage and stronger adsorption is
generally associated with shorter adsorbate–surface bond
lengths. The increase in bond length is greatest for the atop
mode (0.08 A
˚ ) and is #0.03 A
˚ for the other modes. The
previous study shown in Table 2 gives values which are in
reasonable agreement with the current work for the limited
number of modes considered. Greeley and Mavakaris also
report similar structural data.3
For the doped surfaces, the Pt–H distances are similar. For
the atopPt modes the values on the doped surface fall
between those for Pt (2 6 2) and Pt (!3 6 !3R30u). The
atopSn values are larger than those for atopPt consistent with
tin’s larger radius. The bridgePtPt mode is further away on
PtSn (2 6 2) than on Pt (2 6 2) but it is slightly closer in the
PtSn (!3 6 !3R30u) case. The threefold sites give similar
values for both the pure and doped surfaces.
Charge redistribution
The charge redistribution as a result of the adsorption is
illustrated by the charge density difference (Dr) plots (Fig. 5
and 6) which show the direction of electron flow in the
bonding process. Fig. 5 shows the Dr for hydrogen adsorption
on the Pt {111} surface with (2 6 2) coverage. The dark
regions show areas of increased r and the light areas show
areas which have donated electron density as a result of the
adsorption. For all three adsorption modes, electron density
redistribution is limited to those atoms directly bonded to
the hydrogen. The coverage does not appear to affect the
adsorption to any great extent as the plots for the Pt (2 6 2)
case are the same as those for the (!3 6 !3R30u) coverage (not
shown). The density moves from an orbital on the platinum(s)
into the hydrogen orbital. There is also a small increase in
electron density in another metal orbital.
We can then compare the pure surface with the doped
surfaces shown in Fig. 6. The most remarkable thing is how
similar the plots are to those for the pure surface. All the
common modes (atopPt, bridgePtPt and fccPtPtPt) are very
similar to those found for the pure Pt {111} surface. The

atopSn mode is different from the atopPt mode. The donation
into the 1s orbital of hydrogen remains but the origin of this
extra charge is different.
We have also examined the electronic density of states
(EDOS). Like the charge redistribution and the structure the
EDOS indicates that Sn doping does not significantly effect the
mode of H adsorption.
Vibrational frequency
The symmetric (perpendicular) stretching frequencies for each
system are presented in Table 3. The experimental vibrational
frequency of the H2 molecule is 4560 cm21. The values
observed for atomic species on transition metal surfaces occur
at much lower frequencies, generally in the range 400–
1600 cm21. These are still well above the characteristic
frequencies of the surfaces themselves. For the pure platinum
surface the atop site has a vibrational frequency much higher
than any of the other sites. The bidentate bridge mode is
next over 1000 cm21 lower in frequency. Finally the hydrogen
in the hollow sites is lowest in frequency. There is very little
difference between 0.25 and 0.33 ML hydrogen concentration
and as with the other parameters the fcc and hcp sites give very
similar results.
The tin doped surface shows a similar lack of sensitivity
to the coverage. The values for the atopPt mode and the
bridgePtPt modes are significantly lower than they are on the
pure surface. The hollow sites however are not significantly
perturbed by the tin in the surface. Perhaps this is because the
hydrogen is somewhat buried into the surface in these modes
and does not feel the presence of the tin as strongly. The
atopSn mode is the only one where there is significant
differences between the (2 6 2) and (!3 6 !3R30u) surface
with the more doped surface occurring 92 cm21 higher than
the (2 6 2).
Hong et al.24 calculated all vibrational frequencies involving
hydrogen on Pt {111}. Their values were 589, 592 and
1046 cm21 for the fcc site and 344, 352 and 2213 cm21 for
the atop site. The experimental values for the hollow site are
250 and 548 cm21 but the higher frequency symmetric stretch
was not available.30 We calculated 618, 674 and 1051 cm21 for
the fcc site and 365, 369 and 2404 cm21 for the atop site. The
agreement with the previous calculation is reasonable but the
values are somewhat higher than the experimental frequencies.
The poor agreement with the low frequency modes is
probably due to the simple harmonic oscillator model of
hydrogen adsorption on Pt {111} which does not reproduce
the experimentally observed vibrational spectrum.31 Good

agreement has however been obtained when a full three-
dimensional adiabatic potential energy surface approach was
adopted.31
All the evidence shows the hydrogen avoids the tin on a
doped PtSn surface and prefers to adsorb at a Pt site. However
the adsorption at the platinum sites is not significantly
affected by the presence of tin atoms in the surface. The
avoidance of tin may have other implications for reactions on
the surfaces. Previous calculations,3,26 and experiments32 have
shown that hydrogen diffusion on pure platinum surfaces is
very rapid. The unfavourable interactions with tin may block
these diffusion pathways and so we have investigated surface
diffusion.
Surface diffusion
Elastic band calculations were used to calculate the diffusion
barriers for hydrogen moving across the Pt and PtSn surfaces.
All possible diffusion routes between high symmetry sites
(excluding high energy sites) were considered as shown in
Fig. 7. The calculations were carried out as a set of single
‘‘hops’’ between successive sites. In Fig. 7(a) the start and end
points of each hop are indicated with the hydrogen positions.
The first hop was from the fcc to the atop site, the second from
the atop site to the hcp site etc. Not all the steps considered are
necessary for plausible diffusion paths across the surface. On
the PtSn (2 6 2) surface a more complex series of hops
were calculated (Fig. 7(b)). A simpler bridgePtPt to fccPtPtSn
to hcpPtPtSn and back to bridgePtPt path was traced on the
(!3 6 !3R30u) PtSn surface (Fig. 7(c)).
The activation energies for each of the various hops are
shown in Fig. 8 for each surface. On the pure platinum surface
the largest barrier is only 5 kJ mol21 (Fig. 8(a)). This is
extremely low and diffusion is expected to be very rapid on this
surface. Watson et al. calculated the barrier to H diffusion on
Pt {111} as 12 kJ mol21 using a fixed layer slab calculation.26
Due to the rapid motion of the H atom it is unlikely that the
platinum will have sufficient time for full relaxation during the
diffusion. The previous fixed surface calculations therefore
represent one extreme, and an upper bound on the barrier
height, while the current relaxed calculation represents the
other extreme, and a lower bound on the barrier height.
Greeley and Mavakaris also determined a surface diffusion
barrier of 4 kJ mol21 for H diffusion on Pt {111} moving
along a path from fcc–bridge–hcp sites.3 Using helium scatter-
ing the diffusion barrier has been measured as 7 kJ mol21.32
On the tin doped surfaces however the barrier to diffusion is
much higher. For the (2 6 2) surface the maximum occurs at
41 kJ mol21 (Fig. 8(b)) and on the (!3 6 !3R30u) PtSn {111}
surface diffusion is even more difficult with a maximum of
95 kJ mol21(Fig. 8(c)). It should be noted that if only the first
four steps of Fig. 8(b) are included the hydrogen can still
traverse the surface and this offers a lower barrier to diffusion
of 29 kJ mol21. This is still over five times that on the pure
surface. The largest barrier to diffusion occurs close to tin
atoms
on the surface.
The
pathways close
to
tin are
significantly distorted away from tin as shown in Fig. 7(b–c).
Greeley and Mavakaris also determined the diffusion barriers
on a series of surface platinum alloys to be about double those
on the pure platinum surface with the exception of PtRu
which had a similar value to the pure Pt metal.3 PtSn alloys
were not tested.
The much higher barrier to diffusion on the tin doped
surfaces means that hydrogen will be a lot less mobile on these
surfaces. This lack of hydrogen mobility is likely to have
profound implications for the kinetics of hydrogenation
reactions on the surface. To date such a study of the kinetics
has not been carried out but in other work it has been
calculated
that
changing
the
surface,
for
example
by
introducing steps, generates an activation energy to diffusion
which is strongly coverage and directionally dependent.33
More work is required in this area to determine exactly how
the introduction of Sn to Pt {111} surfaces affects the observed
changes in catalytic activity. In particular experimental studies
would be most welcome.

Conclusions
The adsorption energies for hydrogen in a series of sites on Pt
and PtSn {111} surfaces have been calculated using periodic
density functional theory. The adsorption on Pt {111} was
found to be quite insensitive to the adsorption mode with the
most stable mode atop platinum for a J coverage. Doping
with tin decreased the adsorption energy of that mode by a
small amount. Increasing the coverage on Pt {111} to M
increased the adsorption energies and slightly changed the
order of stability with the bridge mode now preferred.
Adsorption at a tin site was always unfavourable.
The structural, electronic and vibrational data reflect the
insensitivity of H adsorption to the adsorption site and tin
doping.
The activation energies for hydrogen diffusion were also
examined. On Pt {111} the maximum barrier to diffusion was
calculated as 5 kJ mol21. The lowest energy pathway on the tin
doped surfaces gave a value over five times larger than this
although many diffusion routes were significantly higher than
this with the highest barrier calculated at almost 100 kJ mol21.
This will have important implications for the kinetics of
catalytic hydrogenations on PtSn surfaces compared to pure
platinum surfaces.
