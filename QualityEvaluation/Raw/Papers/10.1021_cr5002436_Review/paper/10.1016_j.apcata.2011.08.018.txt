Two
 series  of binary
 In2O3/MOx (M  =  Al,  Zr, Si)  catalysts
 with  low  (3  wt%)  and  high
 (10  wt%)
 In2O3 loadings
were
 prepared
 via  an  incipient  wetness

 The  support

in
 detail  by  testing
 the  propane

 both  in  the  presence
 and  absence
of
 CO2.  Physico-chemical
 properties
 including

 by  X-ray

It
 was  demonstrated
 that
 a higher

is
 favorable
 for  propylene

 Introduction
Light
 alkenes
 such
 as
 propylene
 are
 important
 building
 blocks
in
 a
 myriad
 of
 (petro)chemical
 applications
 thus,
 their
 demand
 is
high
 [1,2].
 A
 great
 deal
 of
 attention
 has
 been
 paid
 to
 the
 so-called
on-purpose
 propylene
 production
 technologies,
 such
 as
 propane
dehydrogenation
 (PDH)
 [3,4],
 due
 to
 their
 potential
 to
 make-up
 the
shortfall
 of
 propylene
 supply
 left
 by
 conventional
 crackers
 where
propylene
 is
 produced
 as
 a
 byproduct
 of
 ethylene.
 However,
 due
 to
the
 thermodynamic
 constrains
 of
 PDH
 reaction,
 high
 reaction
 tem-
perature
 is
 frequently
 used,
 which
 inevitably
 leads
 to
 severe
 coke
formation
 as
 well
 as
 undesired
 thermal
 cracking
 to
 lighter
 alkanes
[5,6].
 Hence
 extra
 hydrogen
 addition
 in
 the
 gas
 feed
 and
 repeated
regeneration
 are
 indispensable
 procedures
 implemented,
 making
this
 process
 energy
 and
 capital
 intensive.
 An
 attractive
 alterna-
tive
 to
 this
 approach
 is
 the
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 (ODH)
 of
propane
 by
 molecular
 oxygen,
 which
 allows
 signiﬁcantly
 lower
reaction
 temperature
 and
 effective
 inhibition
 of
 coke
 deposition
[7].
 Nevertheless,

 loss

deep
 oxidation
 to
 carbon
 oxides
 is
 inevitably
 accompanied,
 existing
as
 the
 main
 drawback
 of
 this
 process
 [1].
To
 circumvent
 this
 problem,
 carbon
 dioxide
 (CO2),
 one
 of
the
 most
 important
 green-house
 gases,
 has
 been
 proposed
 to
be
 a
 promising
 candidate
 as
 milder
 oxidant
 replacing
 oxygen
 in
activation
 of
 light
 alkanes,
 including
 coupling
 of
 methane,
 dehy-
drogenation
 (DH)
 of
 ethylbenzene,
 iso-propylbenzene,
 propane,
 or
iso-butane
 [8].  In
 the
 DH
 reaction,
 CO2 is
 also
 expected
 to
 serve
 as
 a
medium
 for
 supplying
 heat
 for
 the
 endothermic
 dehydrogenation
reaction,
 as
 a
 diluent
 for
 enhancing
 the
 equilibrium
 conversion
 of
light
 alkanes
 and
 as
 an
 agent
 for
 the
 removal
 of
 coke
 formed
 on
the
 catalyst
 [9].  On
 the
 other
 hand,
 contrarily
 to
 what
 is
 tradition-
ally
 believed,
 CO2 is
 not
 inert
 in
 the
 oxidation
 reaction.
 Oxygen
species
 produced
 by
 its
 dissociation
 can
 modify
 the
 oxidation
 state
of
 the
 surface
 atoms
 of
 the
 catalysts
 and
 can
 directly
 participate
in
 the
 oxidation
 of
 the
 hydrocarbon
 [10,11]. Besides,
 taking
 into
account
 the
 environmental
 concerns,
 CO2,
 one
 of
 the
 major
 green-
house
 gases,
 accounts
 for
 the
 fast
 global
 warming
 tendency
 in
 the
past
 decades.
 In
 this
 context,
 CO2 recycling
 by
 the
 PDH
 technique,
not
 only
 produces
 useful
 chemicals
 but
 also
 helps
 alleviate
 envi-
ronmental
 pressure
 for
 excessive
 burning
 of
 fossil
 fuels,
 seemingly
attractive
 from
 both
 economic
 and
 ecological
 perspective
 [12].
To
 date,
 in
 the
 ﬁeld
 of
 PDH
 by
 CO2,
 Cr2O3-,
 V2O5-
 and
 Ga2O3-
based
 materials
 are
 the
 most
 frequently
 reported
 catalytic
 systems.
For
 the
 Cr2O3-
 and
 V2O5-based
 catalysts,
 the
 proposed
 one-step
pathway
 is
 followed,
 in
 agreement
 with
 the
 Mars–Van
 Krevelen
mechanism
 [13,14].
 The
 Ga2O3-based
 catalysts
 is

a
 two-step
 pathway
 mechanism,
 which
 is
 a
 simple
 dehydrogena-
tion
 step
 coupled
 with
 a
 subsequent
 reverse
 water
 gas
 shift
 (RWGS)
reaction
 [15,16]. However,
 fast
 deactivation
 presents
 as
 a
 com-
mon
 problem
 troubling
 all
 the
 above-mentioned
 catalyst
 systems,
ascribed
 to
 either
 exhaustion
 of
 active
 lattice
 oxygen
 atoms
 or
coke
 deposition.
 Thus
 catalysts
 with
 prolonged
 lifetime
 are
 still
highly
 desired.
 Along
 this
 line,
 we
 have
 recently
 demonstrated
 that
In2O3–Al2O3 nanocomposite
 synthesized
 via
 alcoholic
 coprecipita-
tion
 was
 highly
 active
 and
 stable
 a
 new
 catalyst
 in
 the
 PDH
 with
 CO2
[17,18]. An
 interesting
 feature
 of
 the
 In–Al–O
 catalyzed
 PDH
 reac-
tion
 is
 the
 unique
 bifunctional
 character
 of
 the
 indium
 component
in
 the
 In2O3–Al2O3 materials,
 where
 a
 well
 balance
 of
 the
 metallic
In
 species
 active
 and
 the
 bulk
 In2O3 phase
 is
 found
 to
 be
 indispens-
able
 for
 an
 efﬁcient
 CO2-mediated
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 over
the
 In2O3–Al2O3 system.
In
 addition
 to
 the
 speciﬁc
 active
 phases,
 the
 choice
 of
 the
support,
 conventionally
 thought
 to
 play
 important
 role
 in
 the
 dis-
persion
 and
 electronic
 properties
 of
 the
 dispersed
 active
 species,
is
 able
 to
 tune
 further
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 of
 a
 given
 cata-
lyst
 [1].  It
 is
 also
 suggested
 that
 acid–base
 properties
 of
 supports
strongly
 affect
 the
 selectivity
 to
 propylene
 [2].  Hence,
 it
 is
 neces-
sary
 to
 gain
 further
 insight
 into
 the
 support
 effect
 for
 the
 In-based
catalysts.
 To
 this
 end,
 in
 the
 present
 study,
 the
 support
 effect
 for
In-based
 catalysts
 has
 been
 studied,
 and
 Al2O3,
 ZrO2 and
 SiO2 were
selected
 as
 three
 supports,
 taking
 into
 account
 their
 differenti-
ated
 surface
 properties
 in
 terms
 of
 afﬁnity
 to
 In2O3 and
 relative
acid/base
 strength.
 For
 each
 support,
 both
 low
 and
 high
 In-loading
samples
 were
 synthesized.
 Detailed
 correlation
 of
 characteriza-
tion
 results
 and
 PDH
 activities
 performed
 reveals
 the
 abundance
of
 highly
 dispersed
 indium-species
 and
 acid–base
 properties
 are
two
 key
 parameters
 that
 determine
 the
 high
 PDH
 performance
 for
the
 In-based
 catalysts.

 Experimental
2.1.
 Catalyst
 preparation
The
 samples
 were
 prepared
 by
 incipient
 wetness
 impregna-
tion
 using
 the
 appropriate
 amounts
 of
 In(NO3)3·5H2O
 from
 Aldrich
(99.99%)
 in
 order
 to
 obtain
 two
 different
 indium
 oxide
 loadings
 for
each
 support,
 one
 series
 of
 samples
 with
 loadings
 around
 3
 wt%
(hereafter
 named
 In(3)/M
 or

 and
 the
 sec-
ond
 one
 with
 loadings
 around
 10
 wt%
 (hereafter
 named
 In(10)/M
or
 high

 samples).
 The
 support
 SiO2 was
 purchased
 from
Degussa
 (Aerosil

 and
 was
 pre-calcined
 at
 873
 K
 for
 6
 h.
 -

2.2.
 Catalyst
 characterization
The
 BET
 speciﬁc
 surface
 areas
 of
 the
 samples
 were
 deter-
mined
 by
 adsorption–desorption
 of
 nitrogen
 at
 liquid
 nitrogen
temperature,
 using
 a
 Micromeritics
 TriStar
 3000
 equipment.
 Sam-
ple
 degassing
 was
 carried
 out
 at
 300 ◦C
 prior
 to
 acquiring
 the
adsorption
 isotherm.
 The
 X-ray
 powder
 diffraction
 (XRD)
 of
 the
catalysts
 was
 carried
 out
 on
 a
 Bruker
 D8
 Advance
 X-ray
 diffrac-
tometer
 using
 nickel
 ﬁltered
 Cu
 K radiation
 at
 40
 kV
 and
 20
 mA,
0.02◦step
 size,
 and
 0.2
 s
 step
 time.
 The
 acidic
 and
 basic
 properties
of
 each
 catalyst
 were
 characterized
 by
 temperature-programmed
desorption
 (TPD)
 of
 NH3 and
 CO2,
 respectively.
 In
 a
 typical
 experi-
ment
 for
 TPD
 studies,
 about
 200
 mg
 of
 the
 oven-dried
 sample
 (dried
at
 383
 K
 overnight)
 was
 placed
 in
 a
 U-shaped
 quartz
 sample
 tube.
NH3 (or
 CO2)
 was
 saturated
 at
 413
 K
 after
 pre-treatment
 at
 773
 K
in
 a
 He
 stream.
 The
 NH3 (or
 CO2)
 desorbed
 was
 determined
 by
 gas
chromatography
 at
 temperatures
 from
 413
 to
 873
 K
 at
 a
 ramp
 rate
of
 10
 K
 min−1 and
 subsequently
 maintained
 at
 873
 K
 for
 30
 min.
The
 XPS
 spectra
 were
 recorded
 under
 vacuum
 (<10−6 Pa)
 on
 a
Perkin-Elmer
 PHI
 5000C
 ESCA
 system
 equipped
 with
 a
 dual
 X-ray
source
 using
 an
 Mg
 K
 (h
 =
 1253.6
 eV)
 anode
 and
 a
 hemispheric
energy
 analyzer.
 The
 binding
 energies
 (BE)
 were
 referenced
 to
 the
C
 1s
 peak
 of
 contaminant
 carbon
 at
 284.6
 eV
 with
 an
 uncertainty
of
 ±0.2
 eV.
 Elemental
 analysis
 was
 performed
 using
 ion-coupled
plasma
 (ICP)
 atomic
 emission
 spectroscopy
 on
 a
 Thermo
 Elec-
tron
 IRIS
 Intrepid
 II
 XSP
 spectrometer.
 Temperature-programmed
reduction
 (TPR)
 results
 were
 obtained
 on
 a
 homemade
 apparatus
loaded
 with
 20
 mg  of
 catalyst.
 The
 samples
 were
 pretreated
 in
 ﬂow-
ing
 nitrogen
 at
 773
 K
 for
 1
 h.
 After
 cooled
 to
 room
 temperature,
the
 samples
 were
 subsequently
 contacted
 with
 an
 H2/Ar
 mixture
(H2/Ar
 molar
 ratio
 of
 5/95
 and
 a
 total
 ﬂow
 of
 40
 mL
 min−1)
 and
heated
 at
 a
 rate
 of
 5
 K
 min−1,
 to
 a
 ﬁnal
 temperature
 of
 1073
 K.
 The
H2 consumption
 was
 monitored
 by
 an
 on-line
 TCD
 detector.
 Ther-
mal
 gravimetric
 analysis
 (TGA)
 was
 conducted
 on
 a
 Perkin-Elmer
TGA-7
 apparatus
 to
 determine
 the
 amount
 of
 coke
 deposited
 on
 the
catalyst
 after
 the
 reaction.
 Twenty
 milligrams
 of
 sample
 was
 heated
from
 room
 temperature
 to
 873
 K
 at
 a
 heating
 rate
 of
 10
 K
 min−1 in
ﬂowing
 air.
2.3.
 Catalytic
 activity
 tests
Catalytic
 tests
 were
 performed
 in
 a
 ﬁxed-bed
 microreactor
 at
ambient
 pressure.
 The
 catalyst
 load
 was
 200
 mg,
 and
 it
 was
 acti-
vated
 at
 873
 K
 in
 N2 (BOC
 99.99%)
 for
 2
 h
 prior
 to
 the
 reaction.
For
 nonoxidative
 PDH,
 the
 gas
 reactant
 contained
 2.5
 vol%
 propane
(BOC
 99.5%)
 and
 a
 balance
 of
 nitrogen.
 For
 PDH
 by
 carbon
 dioxide,
the
 gas
 reactant
 contained
 2.5
 vol%
 propane,
 10
 vol%
 carbon
 diox-
ide
 (BOC
 99.99%),
 and
 a
 balance
 of
 nitrogen.
 The
 total
 ﬂow
 rate
 of
gas
 reactant
 was
 10
 mL
 min−1.
 The
 feed
 and
 the
 reaction
 products
were
 analyzed
 on-line
 by
 online
 gas
 chromatograph
 (Type
 GC-122,
Shanghai).
 Permanent
 gases
 (CO,
 CO2)
 and
 water
 (H2O)
 were
 sep-
arated
 using
 a
 TDX-01
 column
 connected
 to
 a
 TCD
 detector
 and
other
 reaction
 products
 were
 analyzed
 employing
 a
 Porapak
 Q
 col-
umn
 connected
 to
 a
 FID
 detector.
 Blank
 runs
 show
 that
 under
 the
experimental
 conditions
 used
 in
 this
 work
 the
 thermal
 dehydro-
genation
 could
 be
 neglected.
 During
 reaction
 no
 aromatic
 products
were
 detected
 by
 GC,
 and
 all
 carbon
 balances
 closed
 within
 92–95%.
2.4.
 Temperature-programmed
 reaction
 of
 CO2 with
 H2
A
 temperature-programmed
 CO2–H2 test
 was
 carried
 out
 to
investigate
 the
 activity
 of
 the
 supported
 In2O3 catalysts
 for
 the
RWGS
 reaction.
 The
 measurements
 were
 performed
 in
 a
 ﬂow
microreactor
 system.
 Prior
 to
 the
 experiment,
 a
 sample
 (100
 mg)
was
 outgassed
 in
 a
 ﬂow
 of
 pure
 helium
 at
 873
 K
 for
 30
 min.
 Sub-
sequently,
 the
 microreactor
 was
 cooled
 down
 to
 about
 443
 K.
Reaction
 was
 performed
 using
 CO2/H2/He
 gas
 mixture
 with
 the
ratio
 of
 1:1:4
 and
 total
 ﬂow
 rate
 of
 12
 mL
 min−1.
 The
 experiment
was
 carried
 out
 with
 a
 linear
 heating
 rate
 of
 10
 K
 min−1 up
 to
 the
ﬁnal
 temperature
 of
 973
 K.
 The
 reactants
 and
 all
 possible
 prod-
ucts
 of
 reaction
 were
 continuously
 monitored
 by
 the
 QMS
 detector
(Balzers
 OmniStar).
 The
 signal
 of
 the
 helium
 line
 served
 as
 the
 inter-
nal
 standard
 to
 compensate
 ﬂuctuations
 of
 the
 operating
 pressure.

3.1.
 XRD
 results
The
 XRD
 proﬁles
 of
 both
 high
 and
 low
 loading
 samples
 as
 syn-
thesized
 are
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 1.
 The
 diffraction
 patterns
 for
 samples
In/Zr
 containing
 In2O3 up
 to
 10%
 are
 characteristic
 of
 bare
 zirco-
nia
 support
 (monoclinic
 zirconia
 (JCPDS
 card
 37-1484)
 in
 majority
together
 with
 a
 small
 fraction
 of
 tetragonal
 zirconia
 (JCPDS
 card
 17-
923)).
 In
 the
 case
 of
 In/Al,
 no
 diffraction
 lines
 other
 than
 those
 of
 the
-Al2O3 support
 (JCPDS
 card
 10-425)
 are
 observed
 for
 the
 low
 load-
ing
 sample,
 while
 in
 In(10)/Al
 diffraction
 patterns
 characteristic
 of
the
 cubic
 structure
 of
 In2O3 (JCPDS
 card
 6-0416)
 have
 been
 iden-
tiﬁed,
 despite
 their
 relatively
 weak
 intensities.
 In
 sharp
 contrast
 to
the
 above
 two
 series,
 for
 the
 silica
 supported
 catalysts,
 even
 in
 the
low
 indium
 loading
 sample
 signals
 regarding
 crystallized
 indium
oxide
 species
 have
 readily
 formed.
 And
 further
 enhancement
 in
In2O3 loading
 up
 to
 10%
 results
 in
 well
 deﬁned
 diffraction
 peaks
 of
c-In2O3.
 It
 should
 be
 pointed
 out
 that
 in
 all
 supported
 indium
 oxide
samples,
 the
 intensities
 of
 the
 diffraction
 peaks
 and
 their
 positions
for
 the
 different
 supported
 indium
 oxide
 samples
 are
 very
 similar
to
 bulk
 indium
 oxide,
 indicating
 that
 the
 support
 does
 not
 have
 a
signiﬁcant
 inﬂuence
 on
 the
 crystallization
 of
 indium
 oxide,
 and
 in
particular
 does
 not
 favor
 the
 crystallization
 in
 a
 special
 plane.
 The
widths
 at
 half-height
 (FWHM)
 of
 the
 diffraction
 peaks
 are
 related
to
 the
 size
 of
 the
 crystal
 phases;
 with
 respect
 to
 this
 criterion,
 the
dispersion
 at
 same
 indium
 loading
 levels
 is
 obviously
 the
 poorest
for
 In/Si.

 All
 the
 samples
 exhibit
 two
 reduction
 features
 during
 TPR
in
 the
 temperature
 range
 of
 473–773
 K
 (peak
 ˛)
 and
 773–1073
 K
(peak
 ˇ)
 respectively.
 Park
 et
 al.
 reported
 similar
 observations
 in
their
 study
 of
 supported
 In2O3/Al2O3 catalysts
 for
 the
 selective
 cat-
alytic
 reduction
 of
 NOx and
 also
 compared
 the
 reduction
 behavior
of
 indium
 oxide
 at
 different
 loadings
 [19].
 Perdigon-Melon
 et
 al.
suggested
 that
 the
 two
 characteristic
 reduction
 peaks
 for
 indium
species
 were
 generally
 attributed
 to
 the
 reduction
 of
 indium
 oxide
particles
 (In3+ →
 In0)
 of
 different
 sizes,
 i.e.
 the
 peak
 ˛
 corresponds
to
 the
 reduction
 of
 highly
 dispersed
 indium
 oxide
 species
 while
peak
 ˇ
 to
 bulk
 In2O3 [20].
 To
 determine
 the
 amount
 of
 each
 indium
oxide
 species,
 all
 hydrogen
 consumption
 with
 respect
 to
 ˛
 and
ˇ
 peaks,
 respectively
 were
 calculated,
 and
 collected
 in
 Table
 1.
From
 these
 data,
 it
 is
 clear
 that
 by
 raising
 In2O3 content
 from
 3%
up
 to
 10%
 over
 the
 same
 support,
 the
 hydrogen
 consumption
 (ˇ)
increases
 more
 rapidly
 than
 that
 of
 ˛,
 suggesting
 a
 favored
 creation
of
 aggregated
 In2O3 particles
 at
 higher
 indium
 surface
 concentra-
tions.
 This
 observation
 is
 fully
 consistent
 with
 the
 properties
 of
In2O3/Al2O3 catalysts
 reported
 by
 Park
 et
 al.
 [19].
 As
 far
 as
 the
 sup-
port
 effect
 is
 concerned,
 note
 that
 the
 amount
 of
 highly
 dispersed
In2O3 represented
 by
 H2 consumption
 (˛)
 varied
 distinctly
 among
different
 In/M
 series
 at
 identical
 In-loadings,
 ranked
 as
 follows:
In/Al
 >
 In/Zr
 ≫
 In/Si.
 This
 result,
 together
 with
 the
 XRD
 measure-
ments,
 suggests
 an
 apparently
 higher
 dispersion
 of
 surface
 In2O3
species
 for
 over
 In/Al
 and
 In/Zr
 in
 contrast
 to
 In/Si.
XPS
 gives
 an
 idea
 on
 both
 the
 oxidation
 state
 and
 concentra-
tion
 of
 indium
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 sample.
 For
 all
 fresh
 samples
used
 in
 the
 present
 work,
 only
 one
 oxidation
 state
 was
 found,
 with
In
 3d5/2 binding
 energy
 between
 444.5
 and
 444.8
 eV,
 characteris-
tic
 of
 In(III).
 Loading
 of
 In2O3 over
 ZrO2,
 Al2O3 and
 SiO2 seems
 to
have
 little
 inﬂuence
 on
 BE
 of
 Al
 2p3/2,
 Zr
 3d5/2 and
 Si
 2p
 of
 the
supports
 (Table
 2).
 To
 gain
 further
 insight
 into
 the
 chemical
 state
of
 the
 supported
 indium
 species
 during
 reduction
 procedure
 and
the
 possible
 inﬂuence
 of
 CO2 exposure
 upon
 the
 in
 situ-created
metallic
 indium,
 XPS
 studies
 on
 In(3)/Al
 subjected
 to
 various
 atmo-
spheric
 treatments
 were
 performed
 (see
 Fig.
 3).
 In
 the
 case
 of
 the
fresh
 In(3)/Al
 sample
 (Fig.
 3a),
 only
 bands
 assigned
 to
 In(III)
 species
were
 observed.
 After
 reduction
 treatment
 at
 773
 K
 (Fig.
 3b),
 an
additional
 feature
 signaling
 the
 formation
 of
 metallic
 In0 (BE
 In
3d5/2 =
 443.5
 eV)
 species
 was
 shown
 [17].
 The
 In0 accounted
 for
36.5%
 of
 the
 overall
 indium
 atoms
 based
 on
 deconvolution

ysis,
 in

 with

 Surface
 acid/base
 properties
The
 surface
 acidity
 of
 the
 supported
 In2O3 catalysts
 with
 both
high
 and
 low
 loadings
 was
 measured
 by
 NH3-TPD,
 and
 the
 quanti-
ﬁed
 results
 are
 provided
 in
 Table
 3.
 Dumesic
 and
 co-workers
 have
discussed
 the
 generation
 of
 acid
 sites
 when
 one
 oxide
 is
 deposited
onto
 another
 to
 form
 a
 surface-phase
 oxide
 [21].
 Thus,
 it
 is
 inter-
esting
 to
 study
 the
 acidity
 of
 the
 indium
 oxide
 loaded
 on
 different
supports.
 The
 acidic
 strength
 distribution
 by
 NH3-TPD
 is
 described
in
 two
 temperature
 regions
 (i.e.
 443–773
 and
 773–873
 K),
 which
point
 to
 acid
 sites
 with
 weak
 and
 medium
 strength,
 respectively.
The
 number
 and
 density
 of
 acidic
 sites
 were
 both
 calculated
 accord-
ing
 to
 their
 corresponding
 peak
 intensities
 as
 well
 as
 BET
 surface
areas,
 expressed
 in
 terms
 of
 mmol
 g−1
cat and
 mol
 m−2
cat,
 respectively.
For
 each
 support,
 increasing
 In-loading
 from
 3%
 to
 10%
 all
 results
 in
a
 pronounced
 decrease
 in
 total
 acidity,
 which
 was
 associated
 with
the
 less
 acidic
 site
 amount
 for
 indium
 oxide
 in
 contrast
 to
 those
 for
the
 bare
 supports.
 Similar
 observation
 was
 obtained
 by
 Gervasini
et

 in-depth
 study
 of

 of

lysts

[22].
 Taking
 the
 support
 effect
 into
 account,
 at

 levels,
 the
 zirconia
 supported
 samples
 exhibit
 the
 highest
overall
 acidic
 site
 densities
 (10–12

 followed
 by
 alumina

 (5–6

 and
 those

 amount
 to

 dramatically
 lower
 than
the

The
 basicity
 measurements
 of
 all
 the

were
 carried
 out
 by
 CO2-TPD.
 Again,
 two
 asymmetric

orption

 were
 observed
 at:
 443–753

 and
 753–873

which
 
deﬁne

conﬁrming
 that
 the
 select
 of
 support
 has
 a
 signiﬁcant
 impact
 on
the
 surface
 basicity
 of
 the
 supported
 In2O3 materials.
 It
 is
 notewor-
thy
 that
 the
 basic
 site
 density
 for
 In/Zr
 is
 2.2–2.8
 and
 16–34
 times
higher
 than
 those
 for
 In/Al
 and
 In/Si,
 respectively,
 suggesting
 a
dramatically
 higher
 basicity
 for
 In/Zr
 compared
 with
 the
 other
 two
counterpart
 series.
 Through
 comparison
 of
 the
 results
 at
 different
indium
 loadings,
 one
 can
 easily
 discover
 that
 an
 increase
 in
 In2O3
content
 for
 all
 three
 series
 leads
 to
 an
 appreciable
 enhancement
in
 basicity,
 contrary
 to
 their
 observed
 trend
 in
 acid
 properties.
This
 feature
 is
 resulted
 from
 the
 more
 basic
 character
 of
 In2O3 in
contrast
 to
 the
 three
 bare
 supports.
3.4.
 Dehydrogenation
 activities
The
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 to
 propylene
 over
 the
 high
indium
 loading
 supported
 materials
 along
 with
 the
 unsupported
In2O3 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2 was
 investigated
 at
 873
 K.
 The
 major
product
 formed
 in
 the
 reaction
 is
 propylene,
 and
 the
 minor
 prod-
ucts
 are
 ethane,
 ethylene,
 and
 methane.
 The
 results,
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 4,
point
 to
 a
 marked
 support
 effect
 on
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 of
 the
supported
 samples.
 Unsupported
 In2O3 demonstrated
 low
 propane
conversion
 of
 <10%
 and
 deactivated
 fast
 within
 5
 h,
 which
 is
 fully
in
 line
 with
 its
 inferior
 dehydrogenation
 activities
 as
 reported
by
 Nakagawa
 et
 al.
 [23].
 It
 is
 noteworthy
 that
 In(10)/Si
 closely
resembled
 bulk
 In2O3 in
 catalytic
 behavior
 and
 deactivated
 in
 8
 h.
In
 contrast,
 remarkably
 higher
 propane
 conversions
 were
 observed
for
 In(10)/Al
 (20–24%)
 and
 In(10)/Zr
 (25–28%).
 Another
 interest-
ing
 ﬁnding
 is
 that,
 during
 0–3
 h,
 In(10)/Al
 and
 In(10)/Zr
 exhibited
relatively
 low
 conversions
 of
 propane
 as
 well
 as
 extremely
 poor
selectivities
 to
 propylene.
 In
 our
 previous
 study,
 such
 unique
 induc-
tion
 period
 has
 been
 attributed
 to
 the
 in
 situ
 creation
 of
 In0
species
 generated
 from
 the
 well-dispersed
 In2O3 under
 reductive
atmosphere,
 and
 this
 speciﬁc
 In0 species
 is
 conﬁrmed
 as
 the
 intrin-
sic
 active
 center
 for
 dehydrogenation
 [17].
 Maximum
 propane
conversions
 over
 In(10)/Zr
 and
 In(10)/Al
 were
 achieved
 at
 3
 h,
 fol-
lowed
 by
 gradual
 deactivation
 at
 a
 moderate
 rate
 due
 to
 coke
formation.
 The
 coke
 amounts
 for
 all
 the
 samples
 reacted
 for
 8
 h
have
 been
 determined
 by
 TGA
 (Table
 1).
 The
 coke

 exhibiting

loss

 Through

 of
 In(10)/Zr
 with
 In(10)/Al,
 supe-
rior
 “initial”
 propane
 conversion
 (27.9%
 at
 3
 h)
 was
 observed
 for
In(10)/Zr
 in
 contrast
 to
 23.6%
 for
 In(10)/Al.
 However,
 if
 calculated
in
 terms
 of
 propylene
 yield,
 due
 to
 a
 higher
 selectivity
 to
 propy-
lene
 (84%)
 for
 In(10)/Al
 than
 In(10)/Zr
 (63.4%),
 In(10)/Al
 appears
to
 be
 the
 optimal
 sample
 obtaining
 the
 maximum
 propylene
 yield
(19.8%).
 The
 lower
 selectivity
 for
 In(10)/Zr
 was
 ascribed
 to
 more
severe
 cracking
 which
 gave
 rise
 to
 the
 production
 of
 methane
 and
ethylene.

 as

 in

 The
 characteristic

 was
 shown
 for

 includ-
ing
 In(3)/Si.
 In
 contrast,
 recall
 that
 no
 feature
 of
 induction
 period
was
 observed
 for
 the
 high
 loading
 In/Si
 sample
 (Fig.
 4).
 This
 is
because
 the
 indium
 species
 over
 SiO2 at
 10%
 In-loading
 comprises
predominantly
 crystallized
 In2O3 as
 evidenced
 by
 TPR,
 allowing
In(10)/Si
 to
 resemble
 bulk
 In2O3 largely
 in
 catalytic
 behavior;
whereas
 In(3)/Si
 consists
 of
 well-dispersed
 In2O3 at
 considerably
higher
 percentage
 that
 results
 in
 this
 unique
 feature.
 In
 contrast
to
 In/Si,
 for
 In(3)/Zr
 and
 In(3)/Al,
 similar
 trend
 in
 activity
 devel-
opment
 and
 selectivities
 to
 those
 of
 the

were
 observed,
 but
 with
 decreased

 by
 5–10%.
Moreover,
 analogous
 to
 those
 for
 the

 samples,
 the
“initial”

 of
 propane
 at

 for
 the

alysts
 decreased
 in
 the
 same
 order:

 >

further
 suggesting
 a
 marked
 support
 effect
 for
 the
 supported
 In2O3
catalysts.

Of
 further
 note
 is
 the
 conversion
 of
 CO2 during
 PDH.
 As
 a
 gen-
eral
 trend,
 over
 the
 same
 support,
 the
 CO2 conversions
 at
 high
 In2O3
loadings
 are
 apparently
 higher
 than
 those
 at
 low
 loadings
 (Fig.
 6).
As
 far
 as
 the
 support
 effect
 is
 concerned,
 surprisingly,
 CO2 con-
versions
 for
 In(10)/Zr
 (20–26%)
 are
 remarkably
 higher
 than
 those
for
 the
 other
 two
 series
 (i.e.
 9–12%
 for
 In(10)/Al
 and
 2–7%
 for
In(10)/Si).
 It
 is
 known
 that
 higher
 conversion
 of
 CO2 may
 facilitate
DH
 via
 RWGS
 [8],  thus
 it
 is
 interesting
 to
 further
 investigate
 the
activity
 of
 RWGS
 over
 the
 supported
 In2O3 catalysts.
 To
 this
 end,
temperature-programmed
 test
 of
 CO2–H2 were
 carried
 out,
 and
 the
results
 were
 provided
 in
 Fig.
 7.
 In
 the
 whole
 reaction
 temperature
range
 (443–973
 K),
 it
 is
 evident
 that
 for
 either
 3
 wt%
 (Fig.
 7A)
 or
10
 wt%
 (Fig.
 7B)
 series,
 the
 sequence
 of
 RWGS
 activities
 arrays
 as
In/Zr
 >
 In/Al
 >
 In/Si,
 in
 agreement
 with
 those
 for
 the
 conversions
 of
CO2 and
 propane
 during
 PDH
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2 (Figs.
 4–6).
Namely
 the
 high
 conversion
 of
 CO2 during
 PDH
 for
 In/Zr
 could
 be
related
 to
 RWGS,
 which
 accounts
 for
 the
 promotional
 effect
 of
 CO2
to
 PDH.
Given
 that
 the
 CO2 reactivity
 varied
 depends
 on
 the
 support
employed,
 which
 meanwhile
 controls
 the
 extent
 to
 which
 PDH
 is
facilitated
 by
 RWGS,
 the
 support
 effect
 concluded
 from
 the
 above-
mentioned
 experiments
 actually
 reﬂected
 a
 combined
 result
 of
 PDH
and
 RWGS.
 However,
 the
 “pure”
 support
 effect
 on
 PDH
 solely
 still
remains
 unclear.
 To
 clarify
 this
 point,
 the
 PDH
 in
 the
 absence
 of
CO2 was
 also
 conducted.
 For
 both
 high
 and
 low
 loading
 samples,
the
 characteristic
 phenomenon
 of
 induction
 period
 showed
 again,
but
 lasted
 for
 only
 2
 h
 (Fig.
 8a
 and
 b).
 The
 sequence
 of
 activity
at
 identical
 indium
 loadings
 arrayed
 as
 follow:
 In/Al
 >
 In/Zr
 >
 In/Si.
For
 further
 analysis,
 a
 correlation
 between
 active
 site
 amount
 and
propane
 conversion
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 CO2 has
 been
 made.
 In
 Fig.
 8c,
a
 linear
 relationship
 of
 metallic
 In0 (active
 species
 for
 PDH
 [17])
amount
 represented
 by
 H2 consumption
 (˛)
 and
 propane
 con-
version
 was
 shown,
 suggesting
 the
 key
 role
 of
 the
 abundance
of
 active
 sites
 in
 determining
 the
 PDH
 activities.
 In
 contrast
 to
those
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2,
 conversions
 of
 propane
 were
 gen-
erally
 lower.
 Interestingly,
 note
 that
 the
 sequence
 for
 DH
 activity
(In/Al
 >
 In/Zr
 >
 In/Si)
 differed
 distinctly
 in
 contrast
 to
 the
 original
In/Zr
 >
 In/Al
 >
 In/Si
 for
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2.
 Detailed
 calculation
suggests
 In/Zr
 to
 be
 with
 the
 largest
 activity
 discrepancy
 compared
between
 two
 atmospheric
 conditions
 (by
 c.a.
 16%
 at
 3
 h).
 This
 fea-
ture
 is
 coherent
 with
 the
 highest
 CO2 conversions
 in
 PDH
 achieved
over
 In/Zr
 samples
 (Fig.
 6).
 In
 addition,
 comparing
 the
 coke
 amounts
of
 samples
 reacted
 for
 8
 h
 in
 the
 presence
 and
 absence
 of
 CO2, rel-
atively
 milder
 coking
 rate
 was
 observed
 for
 those
 in
 the
 absence
 of
CO2 (Table
 1).

 Discussion
It
 has
 been
 established
 in
 our
 previous
 study
 that
 dehy-
drogenation
 of
 propane
 over
 In2O3-based
 catalysts
 completes
within
 two
 steps:
 direct
 PDH
 (C3H8 →
 C3H6 +
 H2)
 and
 RWGS
(CO2 +
 H2 →
 CO
 +
 H2O)
 [17].

equilibrium

[8].
 The
 support
 effects
 demonstrated
 in
 the
 above
 experiments
actually
 impact
 either
 PDH
 or
 RWGS.
 Among
 these
 support
 effects,
dispersion
 of
 In2O3 could
 be
 the
 most
 important
 factor
 in
 tuning
DH
 activity,
 especially
 during
 the
 direct
 PDH
 step.
 In
 our
 previous
study,
 metallic
 In0 derived
 in
 situ
 from
 the
 highly
 dispersed
 In2O3
has
 been
 proven
 to
 be
 the
 essential
 active
 phase
 for
 direct
 PDH
[17].
 This
 conclusion
 is
 also
 applicable
 for
 the
 supported
 In2O3 cat-
alysts,
 as
 conﬁrmed
 by
 the
 positive
 correlation
 between
 DH
 activity
and
 the
 amount
 of
 metallic
 In0 (Fig.
 8c).
 Careful
 design
 in
 select
 of
support
 which
 offers
 In2O3 dispersion
 high
 can
 therefore
 be
 of
 key
signiﬁcance
 as
 to
 allowing
 for
 abundant
 precursor
 of
 active
 sites
for
 PDH.
 Judging
 from
 the
 XRD
 and
 TPR
 results,
 SiO2 appears
 to
 be
poor
 in
 dispersing
 the
 In2O3 aggregate.
 In
 this
 sense,
 Al2O3 and
 ZrO2
were
 shown
 to
 be
 supports
 certainly
 more
 appropriate
 for
 loading
In2O3,
 in
 view
 of
 their
 far
 superior
 dispersion
 of
 In-species,
 as
 well
as
 obviously
 higher
 PDH
 results
 both
 in
 the
 presence
 and
 absence
of
 CO2.
Further
 considering
 the
 surface
 acid/base
 properties,
 as
 sug-
gested
 
by
 
NH3/CO2-TPD
 
results,
 
the
 
acidity/basicity
 
of
 
the
supported
 catalysts
 depend
 largely
 on
 the
 properties
 of
 the
 sup-
ports.
 Generally,
 the
 total
 acid/basic
 site
 density
 arrayed
 as:
In/Zr
 >
 In/Al
 >
 In/Si,
 fully
 in
 line
 with
 those
 of
 the
 bare
 supports.
In
 contrast
 to
 bare
 supports,
 since
 bulk
 In2O3 is
 considered
 as
 a
basic
 solid
 [20],
 as
 a
 general
 rule,
 the
 total
 acidity
 of
 In/M
 was
decreased
 and
 the
 basicity
 increased
 by
 increasing
 the
 loading
 of
indium
 oxide.
 This
 fact
 is
 consistent
 with
 the
 result
 by
 Gervasini
et
 al.
 [22]
 on
 study
 of
 supported
 In2O3 over
 Al2O3,
 TiO2,
 SiO2 and
Nb2O5. Therefore,
 appropriate
 acid/base
 strength
 can
 be
 achieved
by
 employment
 of
 a
 suitable
 support
 and
 loading
 level.
As
 far
 as
 correlation
 between
 catalytic
 performance
 and
acid–base
 properties
 is
 concerned,
 it
 is
 known
 that
 superior
 sur-
face
 basicity
 favors
 adsorption
 and
 subsequent
 reaction
 of
 acidic
molecules
 (such
 as
 CO2)
 [24].
 In
 a
 study
 by
 Xu
 et
 al.
 for
 the
 supported
Ga2O3 catalysts
 for
 PDH,
 the
 lowest
 RWGS
 activity
 for
 Ga2O3/SiO2
was
 accounted
 for
 by
 its
 inferior
 basicity
 [12].
 In
 our
 previous
 study,
bulk
 In2O3 rather
 than
 Al2O3 was
 suggested
 to
 favor
 RWGS
 to
 a
 cer-
tain
 extent
 due
 to
 its
 higher
 basicity
 in
 contrast
 to
 Al2O3 [17].
 In
 this
study,
 as
 revealed
 by
 CO2-TPD
 experiment
 (Table
 4),
 the
 basic
 site
density
 for
 In/Zr
 is
 far
 superior
 in
 contrast
 to
 the
 other
 two
 coun-
terpart
 series,
 which
 may
 well
 account
 for
 its
 extraordinarily
 high
conversion
 of
 CO2 during
 RWGS
 (Fig.
 7).
 Bear
 in
 mind
 further
 that
In/Zr
 is
 with
 the
 largest
 discrepancy
 in
 conversion
 of
 propane
 com-
pared
 between
 two
 conditions
 (in
 the
 presence/absence
 of
 CO2,
 see
in
 Figs.
 4
 and
 5).
 Thus,
 it
 can
 be
 inferred
 that,
 the
 extraordinarily
high
 surface
 basic
 density
 for
 In/Zr
 allows
 for
 its
 highest
 RWGS
activity,
 which
 facilitates
 PDH
 to
 a
 great
 extent.
Another
 parameter
 noteworthy
 is
 acidity,
 since
 suitable
 surface
acidity
 is
 commonly
 accepted
 as
 a
 crucial
 factor
 for
 achieving
 high
DH
 activities
 [2].
 In
 this
 sense,
 superior
 surface
 acidity
 for
 In/Zr
 and
In/Al
 in
 contrast
 to
 In/Si
 is
 another
 noticeable
 factor
 contributing
to
 their
 higher
 PDH
 activities.
 Nevertheless,
 it
 has
 been
 also
 well
established
 that
 surface
 acidity
 too
 strong
 usually
 renders
 unde-
sired
 side-reactions,
 such
 as
 cracking
 and
 coking
 etc.
 [25].
 Due
 to
 its
highest
 acid
 site
 density,
 cracking
 is
 pronounced
 for
 In/Zr.
 Namely,
the
 relatively
 milder
 surface
 acid
 site
 density
 (Table
 3)
 for
 In/Al
 in
contrast
 to
 In/Zr
 may
 well
 account
 for
 its
 apparently
 higher
 selec-
tivity
 to
 propylene
 (Figs.
 4
 and
 5).
 Considering
 both
 conversion
 of
propane
 and
 selectivity
 to
 propylene
 for
 PDH
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2,
Al2O3 seems
 to
 be
 a
 more
 appropriate
 support
 for
 loading
 In2O3 in
contrast
 to
 ZrO2. Based
 on
 the
 above
 results,
 it
 can
 be
 concluded
that,
 in
 order
 to
 achieve
 selectively
 high
 conversion
 of
 propane
 for
the
 supported
 In2O3 samples,
 well
 dispersion
 of
 In2O3 and
 balanced
acid–base
 properties
 are
 two
 prerequisites
 indispensable.
5.
 Conclusions
The
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 both
 in
 the
 presence
 and
absence
 of
 CO2 were
 studied
 over
 three
 In-based
 catalytic
 sys-
tems
 prepared
 by
 dispersing
 various
 amounts
 of
 In2O3 over
different
 supports.
 Alumina
 was
 found
 to
 be
 the
 most
 effective
support
 in
 terms
 of
 preparing
 active
 and
 selective
 dehydrogena-
tion
 catalysts.
 Generally,
 supports
 that
 are
 able
 to
 disperse
 the
In2O3 aggregates
 with
 high
 In0 stabilization
 in
 situ
 could
 offer
active
 catalytic
 systems.
 The
 better
 dispersion
 of
 In2O3 by
 alu-
mina
 and
 zirconia
 in
 contrast
 to
 silica,
 conﬁrmed
 by
 XRD
 and
TPR
 studies,
 perfectly
 explain
 their
 higher
 activities
 in
 dehydro-
genation.
 Correlation
 of
 acid/base
 characterization
 and
 activities
further
 revealed
 a
 high
 density
 of
 basic
 sites
 over
 In/Zr
 that
accounted
 for
 its
 remarkable
 promotion
 of
 RWGS,
 which
 facili-
tates
 the
 PDH.
 Superior
 catalytic
 performance
 in
 PDH
 with
 CO2
over
 alumina
 supported
 indium
 samples
 were
 due
 mainly
 to
 a
combined
 effect
 of
 high
 In2O3 dispersion
 and
 balanced
 acid/base
properties.
