Furthermore, the influence of various employed promoters, i.e., alkali and alkaline earth, transition, rare earth elements, and phosphorus, on the chemical properties of the modified ZSM-5 and the performance of resulting catalyst in enhancing the selectivity to light olefins, have been addressed. Moreover, the influences of different factors, including the zeolite acidity, Si/Al ratio and the temperature, on the light olefin production and the reaction scheme have been specified. The role of incorporated element in the catalytic cracking mechanism is also summarized.

1. Introduction
Steam cracking of hydrocarbons has been the major source of light olefins and diolefins for more than half a century. The yield of ethylene and propylene varies between 24–55% and 1.5–18%, respectively depending greatly on the feedstock type and operating condition
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
. It is the first energy-consuming process in petrochemical industry in spite of the improvements that have been made in this process. It requires high reaction temperature 800–880 °C that accounts for 40% of the total energy consuming every year in the entire petrochemical industry and results in high amount of CO2 emission
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
. The development of technologies that not only maximize energy and resource-savings but also minimize CO2 emissions is stimulated by global environmental issues. Moreover, the additional disadvantages of steam cracking are the limited control over the P/E (propylene to ethylene) ratios in the olefins coming from steam crackers and its direct dependence on the feed type, whilst the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene
[3]
,
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
. Hence, the processes capable of controlling the ratio of light olefins are preferred
[3]
,
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
. The catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons has attracted researchers’ attention to overcome the mentioned disadvantages.
The catalytic cracking of various types of hydrocarbons have been investigated over the modified HZSM-5 zeolites in order to enhance light olefin production. The reaction occurs at 550–650 °C that is about 200 °C lower than steam cracking, and the yields of ethylene and propylene are high enough to compete with the steam cracking products. It is noteworthy that the effect of feed type on the light olefins ratio is not as prominent as the steam cracking and the ratios of P/E could be controlled by adjusting the acid type, acid strength, and acid distribution, i.e. Lewis/Brønsted (L/B) acid sites, as well as the operating condition. Moreover, researchers have attempted to establish the fundamental technologies for catalyst design and preparation in order to commercialize the industrial processes in this field.
In the present paper, light olefin production via catalytic cracking of various industrial types of hydrocarbons, i.e., heavy feedstocks, naphtha range, and gaseous feedstocks, over modified ZSM-5 zeolites has been reviewed; furthermore, the latest activities accomplished in this regard are highlighted. The review has merely focused on ZSM-5 type zeolite because the promising results of light olefin production have been mostly achieved over this pentasil type structure. In other words, this paper does not cover all the different catalytic cracking researches carried out using various types of hydrocarbons and/or zeolite structures.
In addition, the function of various employed promoters on the chemical properties, and the performance of the resulting catalyst in enhancing the selectivity to light olefins have been addressed. Moreover, the influence of different factors such as, the zeolite acidity, the Si/Al ratio and the operating condition on the reaction scheme has been specified. It also summarizes some relevant ideas regarding the role of incorporated elements in the catalytic cracking mechanism in order to shed light on this process. It is noteworthy that the catalytic dehydrogenation processes are not included in this paper and it also excludes cycloalkanes, unsaturated and aromatic hydrocarbons.
2. Summary of historical aspects
Great effort has been dedicated to the researches on developing a novel process that can overcome the deficiencies of steam cracking. Different types of catalysts (basic catalysts, transition metal oxide catalysts and acidic catalysts) have been studied in the catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons to achieve higher yields of light olefins
[3]
,
[5]
,
[11]
.
The use of metal oxides such as CaO, A12O3, SrO, MgO, TiO2, MnO2, Mn2O3, ZrO2, K2O, and In2O3, in olefin production has been investigated since 1960. An ethylene yield of 24–40% and a propylene yield of 15–22% have been obtained over metal oxide catalysts depending on the feed type and the reaction condition
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
,
[16]
,
[17]
. The calcium aluminate (12CaO–7Al2O3) loaded with K2CO3, and potassium vanadate (KVO3) on alumina creates the most promising result. Compared with the conventional steam cracking, the yield of ethylene from naphtha was enhanced by 5–10%, at 770–820 °C
[11]
,
[13]
,
[14]
,
[18]
.
In spite of using the catalyst, the reaction temperature is not reduced considerably, and the higher yield of ethylene is not probably a result of catalytic ethylene production. However, it is due to the improved heat transfer because of surface/volume effect
[18]
,
[19]
and the enhanced rate of coke and heavy hydrocarbons gasification reactions, which produce high amount of CO and CO2
[11]
,
[13]
,
[20]
about 5–20%
[3]
. This concept (catalytic reforming of gasified coke) have been also applied in combination with steam cracking as coatings on the wall of pyrolysis reactors
[21]
,
[22]
, e.g. Linde/Veba's thermocatalytic PYROCAT process
[23]
and/or tube inserts
[20]
,
[24]
,
[25]
,
[26]
,
[27]
, in order to lessen the tendency of carbon to deposit on metal surface and increase light olefin production. The processes of VNIIOS, Toyo engineering, and LG petrochemical have been developed based on the metal oxide catalysts
[11]
, but the catalyst deactivation at elevated reaction temperatures, great amount of steam consumption
[3]
, and high rate of coke formation are critical issues that have decreased the energy efficiency of these processes
[11]
.
The most active and widely investigated catalysts for hydrocarbon cracking are solid proton-donor acids, including zeolites, which are the key components of industrial petroleum cracking catalysts
[28]
. Light olefin production through catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons using zeolites was firstly studied by Pop et al. over bifunctional Ag/Cu/Co–mordenite–Al2O3, at 600–750 °C
[29]
. They obtained ethylene and propylene yields of 8–41% and 11–17%, respectively, in the catalytic cracking of raw materials from n-butane to oil cuts (boiling point >500 °C)
[29]
. Early studies on zeolitic catalysts resulted in low ethylene (15–27%) but high propylene (15–50%) and aromatic (11–34%) yields, at lower temperatures compared with the conventional steam cracking process
[3]
.
To our knowledge, few reports exist concerning the catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons over zeolites with the aim of light olefin production before 1990. Less attention has been dedicated to catalytic production of light olefins specifically ethylene, over zeolites because of the fully developed industrial steam cracking process
[30]
. The recent researchers (after 1990) have focused on formulating a catalyst that could improve the selectivity to both ethylene and propylene in catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons.
3. Why zeolites?
Zeolitic materials are being extensively used in three major catalytic reactions in the area of petroleum refining, petrochemicals and pollution control
[31]
. Zeolites, e.g. ZSM-5, are active catalysts and/or supports for a variety of reactions such as cracking, alkylation, aromatization, isomerization of hydrocarbons, etc., owing to their activity, shape selectivity
[30]
,
[32]
,
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
, ion-exchanging properties and special pore structure, such as the tri-dimensional micro-pore topology and large specific surface area in ZSM-5
[37]
,
[38]
,
[39]
,
[40]
,
[41]
,
[42]
. Zeolites have not yet been employed for on-purpose olefin production through catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons because of the existing well-established industrial steam cracking process; nevertheless, they play an important role in the olefin industry, especially in the processes that are under development or improvement, in order to meet the requirements for more efficient technologies
[30]
.
4. Producing light olefins via catalytic cracking of various hydrocarbons over modified ZSM-5 zeolites
The production of light olefins through catalytic cracking of different types of industrial feeds, i.e. heavy feedstocks, naphtha range, and gaseous feedstocks, are reported in the following sections.
4.1. Heavy feedstocks
Steam cracking is still the most reliable and efficient commercial process for the production of light olefins, specifically ethylene
[43]
. The primary sources of propylene have been as a byproduct from steam cracking and refinery fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units. The conventional FCC technology results in the yield of propylene and ethylene about 3–6 wt.% and 1–2 wt.%, respectively
[11]
,
[30]
. Currently, about 30% of the world's propylene is supplied by refinery FCC operations, 60–65% is co-produced from steam cracking, and the remaining is produced on-purpose using metathesis or propane dehydrogenation processes
[9]
,
[43]
,
[44]
. The projected growth rate of propylene demand is estimated at 4–5%/year
[44]
. At present, the FCC modified processes (FCC family techniques) accounts for one third of the total propylene supply; thus, it is indispensable to optimize or improve propylene production in these processes
[2]
,
[10]
,
[43]
,
[45]
,
[46]
,
[47]
,
[48]
.
The addition of ZSM-5 to an FCC catalyst is one of the efficient methods for improving the yield of light olefins
[49]
,
[50]
because it provides refiners with a high degree of flexibility to optimize the production output
[51]
,
[52]
. Utilizing HZSM-5 as a hybrid catalyst, results in minimizing hydrogen transfer reactions, so it hinders bimolecular reactions; consequently, enhances cracking over hydrogen transfer due to its shape selective sinusoidal pore structure
[52]
,
[53]
. Moreover, its acidity significantly influences on selectivity, given that high acidity enhances the cracking of high molecular weight olefins into the gasoline range, whereas low acidity enhances the isomerization of olefins, especially those of 4–6 C atoms
[52]
. When ZSM-5 is added to the FCC unit, the main reactions it catalyzes are
olefin isomerization and cracking; thus, the yield of
increases while that of
olefins and paraffins decreases. The high
ratio is observed over ZSM-5 additives with enhanced activity
[54]
.

[55]
, UOP's PetroFCC
[56]
, UOP's Fluidized Light Olefin Catalytic Cracking (FLOCC), ABB Lummus’ Selective Catalytic Cracking (SCC), RIPP/Sinopec's Deep Catalytic Cracking (DCCI & II)

, RIPP/Sinopec's and Stone & Webster's Catalytic Pyrolysis Process (CPP)
[57]
,
[58]
,
[59]
, and Grace Davison's HPFCC (High Propylene Fluid Catalytic Cracking)
[60]
, have been commercialized and industrial plants are established based on the mentioned technologies. Vacuum gas oil (VGO), VGO blended with residual oil, cocker gas oil, deasphalted oil, and atmospheric residue are among the industrial feedstocks used in these technologies
[2]
,
[11]
,
[45]
,
[61]
,
[62]
. The yield of ethylene in the first five mentioned processes is typically less than 6 wt.%
[11]
because of the fast aromatization reactions, but they can yield up to 15–25 wt.% propylene
[2]
,
[11]
,
[48]
,
[59]
, while in the former ones the combined yield of ethylene and propylene above 40% has been obtained
[11]
,
[57]
,
[58]
.
4.2. Naphtha range feedstocks
Naphtha is currently one of the dominant feedstocks used worldwide in steam cracking
[2]
. In a typical naphtha cracker, ethylene and propylene yield varies in the range of 25–32.4% and 15.3–16.5%, respectively, with regards to the operating condition
[1]
. It is one of the most attractive feedstocks for investigating the production of light olefins via catalytic cracking because it behaves as an intermediate product of heavy oil catalytic cracking, and its study could also provide further understandings of the FCC process
[63]
,
[64]
. It can also take advantage of the present facilities that are used for steam cracking
[63]
. The properties of typical naphtha feedstocks are presented in

Yoshimura et al. conducted a comprehensive research study on the catalytic cracking of naphtha to produce light olefins under the national project called “Development of a next-generation chemical process technology” that was undertaken from 1995 to 1999, in Japan. They investigated oxidative cracking over basic catalysts (aerobic reaction), oxidative and non-oxidative cracking over transition metal catalysts (aerobic/non-aerobic reaction) and catalytic cracking over solid acid catalysts (non-aerobic reaction), and achieved promising results over a newly developed zeolite-based La2O3-P/ZSM-5 (Si/A1 = 200) catalyst. The developed catalyst could create both a sufficient stability and high yield of ethylene (34 wt.%) and propylene (23 wt.%), at 650 °C (in the presence of steam), which is about 10% higher than the conventional steam cracking process operated at around 820 °C
[3]
. Furthermore, the feasibility study for naphtha processing capacity of 3000 tons/day indicated that the fixed-bed type catalytic cracking unit can reduce energy consumption by more than 20% per ton of ethylene plus propylene and hence decrease CO2 emission by approximately 20%
[3]
.
It was observed that the La loading (Section
5.4
) was apparently the major cause of the lower aromatics formation
[3]
which was different from the results obtained by Wei et al. to some extent. They observed that over La/ZSM-5 (Si/A1 = 72), more than 50% of naphtha was transferred to BTX indicating that hydrogen transfer is more prominent. While, the lower yield of BTX and the higher yields of light olefins were achieved over the other catalysts modified with the incorporation of P specially and the other elements: Mg, Ca, and Cu (
Table 2
). The modification of ZSM-5 zeolites with Co, Ni, Fe and Zn suppressed the BTX generation, although the yield of ethylene and propylene also decreased to some extent
[5]
. Nevertheless, they also achieved the best results over P-La/ZSM-5 (Si/A1 = 72) catalyst with
yield of about 57–60%, at the beginning 10 h. The test of stability (at various times on stream) indicated that over P-La/ZSM-5, the
yield was kept higher than 50% for 30 h, while the yield of 47% at the beginning 1 h of the reaction decreased to 31%, over 10 h on HZSM-5
[5]
. The catalytic cracking reactions under the steam condition (without N2 stream) compared to the results without steam, produced more light olefins over the sample of P/, Mg/, Ca/, Sr/, Cu/ZSM-5, especially for P/ZSM-5
; furthermore, the BTX yield decreased greatly. This suggested that the associated steam improves the yield of light olefins by suppressing the generation of BTX and light paraffins (i.e. methane, ethane, propane), which are thought to be generated from hydrogen transfer
[5]

The synergistic effect of lanthanum and phosphorous is concluded to be prominent to obtain promising results over P-La/ZSM-5 for light olefin production. Adopting both the rare earth and phosphorus to modify the zeolite might result in the formation of RE–P–O oxides that precipitate on the outer surface of zeolite and cover some parts of surface acid sites
[65]
. Lanthanum also stabilizes P species in the zeolite from leaching in steam at high temperatures. The modification of zeolite with rare earth metal and phosphorus altogether, reduces the surface acidity owing to the interaction of rare earth cation and phosphate anion
[65]
,
[66]
. The distinct influences of rare earth elements and phosphorus on ZSM-5 zeolites are reported in Sections
5.4 Rare earth elements
,
5.5 Phosphorus
of this paper, respectively.
The fluorinated HZSM-5 zeolites (F/HZSM-5) could be an effective catalyst for the catalytic cracking of naphtha to light olefins. The F-Modified HZSM-5 samples were prepared by immersing HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 46) zeolite in an aqueous solution of NH4F. Feng. et al. observed that the maximum propylene and ethylene yields reached 36.4% and 20.2%, respectively, at 600 °C (over 0.1F/HZSM-5 which possessed the largest Brønsted acid amount) that were 7.3 and 4.3% higher than those over the parent HZSM-5 zeolite
[63]
. The FT-IR of pyridine adsorption on F/HZSM-5 revealed that the modification with fluorine remarkably enhances the acid amount of HZSM-5. The BET surface area and the pore volume of F/HZSM-5 increased, mainly due to increase in the micropores. The fluorine modification not only regulates the pore characteristics of HZSM-5 zeolites but also modulates the amount of acid sites, especially the density of Brønsted acidity which could be favorable for obtaining a high conversion of naphtha and high selectivity to light olefins
[63]
. Mao et al. found that F-ion-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite shows an enhanced surface acidity because of the formation of new Brønsted acid sites and the strengthening of some acid sites of the parent zeolite. They ascribed it to the proton attack of the zeolite surface by the chemisorbed H+F− ion pair. Under these preparation conditions, the zeolite framework structure is fully preserved
[67]
.
Han et al. carried out the catalytic cracking of heavy naphtha for the selective formation of light olefins over various types of zeolites, i.e. HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 20, 25, 40, and 75), H-mordenite (Si/A1 = 12.5), H-beta (Si/Al = 150), and SAPO-11. The yields of
over H-mordenite, H-beta, and SAPO-11, were 11.2%, 15.2%, and 13.3%, respectively, while that over HZSM-5 (20) was 37.5% (naphtha/steam (w/w) = 2, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 5 h−1, T = 650 °C). Among the various types of catalysts, HZSM-5 was found to be the most effective catalyst for light olefin production. They obtained the maximum yield of
about 48.5 wt.%
over HZSM-5 with the lowest Si/Al = 20 ratio
[7]
. The propylene can be produced selectively through the catalytic cracking of heavy naphtha over HZSM-5 without the loss of total olefin yield
[7]
.
Hayim Abrevaya investigated the cracking of naphtha range alkanes and naphthenes over a series of 8–12-MR (member ring) zeolitic catalysts to verify the relationship between the zeolite topology and naphtha cracking activity. The highest yields of light olefins were obtained over 10-MR zeolites such as ferrierite at 650 °C with 83% naphtha conversion and 54 wt.% selectivity to the ethylene and propylene. The relative activities and selectivities indicated that the activity ranking for the catalysts at 650 °C was: beta (Si/Al = 66), ZSM-22 (Si/Al = 62) > ZSM-23 (Si/Al = 89) > EU-1 (Si/Al = 70) > ZSM-35 (Si/Al = 19), ferrierite (Si/Al = 71) > Y (Si/Al = 81)
[68]
. The
selectivity ranking for the catalysts was: ferrierite > ZSM-22, ZSM-23 > ZSM-35, Y > EU-1 > beta
[68]
. 12-MR zeolites favor bimolecular hydride transfer pathways, which eventually increase the selectivity to light alkanes and coke at the expense of ethylene and propylene
[68]
.
The fluidized-bed catalytic cracking of naphtha over a ZSM-5-based catalyst yielded up to 48% ethylene and propylene at 680 °C
[69]
. The newly developed Advanced Catalytic Olefins (ACO) process combines the KBR fluidized catalytic cracking reactor system with a proprietary catalyst formulated by SK Corporation & Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT). The process selectively converts naphtha and the heavier feedstocks such as kerosene and LGO
[60]
, to large quantities of
and yields roughly 65% olefins with P/E ratios up to 1/1 which is about 15–25% more
than a typical naphtha cracker on a relative basis, depending on the operating conditions
[70]
. The ACO demo plant evaluation with 60,000 tons/year capacity is scheduled to be performed by the end of 2010
[60]
, and the first commercialized ACO process is planned to be implemented at the Number 1 Ethylene Unit of SK Corporation in Ulsan, by 2012
[70]
,
[71]
. The process is claimed to reduce energy needs by 20%
[72]
and initial investment costs by 30%
[71]
.
The results of light olefin production in catalytic cracking of naphtha feedstock over modified ZSM-5 zeolites are summarized in
Table 2
. All the experiments have been carried out in a fixed bed reactor.
4.2.1. C8–C6 alkanes
Catalytic cracking of the typical components of naphtha such as n-octane, n-heptane, n-hexane, methyl hexane, etc., have been widely investigated over zeolites not only to elucidate the performance of catalysts and the reaction mechanism but also to create further improvement in FCC process
[63]
,
[73]
. Some relevant works are reported in this subsection.
Yoshimura et al. investigated the reactivity of several model compounds in the catalytic cracking over 10%La/ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 200). For n-paraffins, an increase in the carbon number results in an enhancement in the olefin yield. Furthermore, as the number of methyl substitutes increased the conversion and olefin yields decreased. This decrease in reactivity is linked to the increased stability of carbenium ions, i.e., the order of the reactivity was: n-paraffins > methyl substituted isomers > dimethyl substituted isomers
[3]
.
Jung et al. studied the influence of pore structure and acidity of various zeolite topologies in the catalytic cracking of n-octane
[74]
. The NH3–TPD results depicted that the order of strong acid site numbers is: beta (Si/Al = 13) < faujasite (Si/Al = 2.65) < ferrierite (Si/Al = 8.5) < MCM-22 (Si/Al = 10) < ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25) < mordenite (Si/Al = 10); however, the strength of strong acid sites increases with the order of: beta ≈ faujasite < MCM-22 ≈ ZSM-5 < ferrierite < mordenite. The order of the conversion over zeolite catalysts at 1 h nicely coincides with that of the acid strength and the amount of strong acid sites, if the faujasite and ferrierite catalysts were eliminated because of their rapid deactivation and mass transfer restriction (at 500 °C). The steric hindrance and the limitation on mass transfer of reactant and products in ferrierite pores cause the low conversions even though it has a medium amount of strong acid sites. On the contrary, the conversion of n-octane over faujasite is extremely low due to rapid deactivation of the catalyst because of the enough space provided for a severe carbon deposition in faujasite supercages. One-dimensional pores of mordenite are easily blocked even with a small amount of carbon deposit (the conversion decreased from 80% to 20% during 4 h reaction)
[74]
. On the other hand, the catalyst life of zeolites is largely dependent on their pore structures. Almost the same conversions at 1 h and 5 h over ZSM-5 catalyst indicate a negligible deactivation. The ZSM-5 large number of strong acid sites and sinusoidal pores cause high and constant catalytic activity that accelerates the cracking of n-octane and suppress the formation of large intermediates. The conversion of n-octane is largely dependent on the number of strong acid sites, while the zeolite pore structure determines the rate of catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposit
[74]
. Furthermore, Jung et al. concluded that the acidity is the predominant factor in determining the conversion level and product composition, so a high conversion and a high yield of alkenes are obtained over ZSM-5 zeolite with a large amount of strong acid sites
[40]
. They found that by increasing the concentration of employed alkali solution, the conversion of n-octane sharply decreased. The maximum yield of
was about 37% (80% conversion)
[40]
.
Altwasser et al. verified the influence of zeolite pore size and spatial constraints on the contribution of monomolecular and bimolecular mechanisms in the catalytic cracking of n-octane. A comparison between 8-, 10-, and12-MR zeolites with similar framework aluminum contents, crystal sizes and ammonium ion exchange degrees clearly reveals that with decreasing the pore dimensions the relative importance of monomolecular cracking is strongly increases as compared to that of bimolecular cracking. The product distribution at similar conversions shifted with decreasing the pore diameter of the zeolitic catalysts from medium-chain (C4–C6) to short-chain (C1–C3) hydrocarbons
[75]
.
Comparing the catalytic cracking of n-heptane on various types of zeolites indicates that a large pore HUSY zeolite is three times more active for cracking but decays some eight times faster than HZSM-5
[76]
. Theoretical calculations based on estimating the magnitude of steric hindrance predicted that hydride transfer would be most restricted in ferrierite and Theta-1; however, the lower heptane adsorption capacities suggested that ZSM-5 would be the best compromise in terms of both high activity and selectivity. The results of the simulation indicated that the zeolites with 12-MR pores (beta and mordenite) or with cage structure (chabazite and erionite) exert a smaller steric influence on the adsorbed molecules/transition states than zeolites with 10-MR pores (ZSM-5, Theta-1and ferrierite) do
[77]
. HZSM-5 and H-ferrierite result in higher alkene selectivity (80% conversion) than H-MCM-22, H-mordenite, H-beta, and HY in the catalytic cracking of n-heptane. The Ca2+ or Ba2+ exchanged HZSM-5 and H-ferrierite gave the highest selectivity (60%) to alkenes at 70% conversion. The concentration of Brønsted acid site does not affect the selective alkene formation but the hindrance of the bimolecular hydride transfer in the Ca2+ or Ba2+-exchanged ferrierite enhances the selectivity to alkenes even at high conversions
[78]
.
The mechanism of catalytic cracking of n-hexane, as a model component, over zeolites has been widely studied
[79]
,
[80]
,
[81]
,
[82]
but the high yield of light olefins has not been addressed in literature. The data obtained in the catalytic cracking of n-hexane over K and Ba impregnated ZSM-5 zeolites indicated that the enhanced small olefin selectivity can be achieved over K/HZSM-5 and Ba/HZSM-5, and the formation of aromatics will be reduced compared to HZSM-5. C2–C4 olefin selectivities reached 54% at the conversion of 94.4%, at a temperature of 873 K
[83]
. Furthermore, Wei et al. observed that the yield of light olefins increased in catalytic cracking of n-hexane over HZSM-5 zeolites ion-exchanged with alkali solution
[6]
. The cracking of n-hexane catalyzed by HZSM-5 zeolites dealuminated under mild steaming conditions enhances the yield of H2 compared with the fresh catalyst. The addition of 1-hexene to n-hexane as a feed led to an increase of the activity of the fresh zeolite, whereas it had just the opposite effect on the activity of dealuminated samples
[84]
. Maia et al. concluded that the bi-functional calcined nickel ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25) zeolite catalyst improves the selectivity toward the light olefins. Nickel was introduced in ZSM-5 zeolite by two different methods, i.e., wetness impregnation and ionic exchange; the later improved the formation of light olefins. The method of metal introduction influences on n-hexane cracking activity and the selectivity to light alkenes
[85]
.
Catalytic cracking of n-hexane over a series of calcinated ZSM-12 samples elucidated that the higher ratios of L/B acid sites increase the cracking activity
[86]
. The catalytic activity of MgAPO-11 was evaluated for hydrocarbon catalytic cracking using n-hexane. It shows a moderate activity for n-hexane catalytic cracking conversion in the reaction temperature range of 450–550 °C
[87]
.
4.3. C4 alkanes
C4 alkanes have been widely investigated for light olefin production as well as kinetic studies over zeolites. They are valuable probe reactants because they are small and symmetrical enough to limit the number of possible products while allowing enough different reaction pathways to be the representative of alkane cracking
[28]
,
[88]
. The recent researches depict that catalytic cracking of C4 alkanes over the modified ZSM-5 zeolites results in high yield of light olefins that is reported in this subsection.
4.3.1. Alkaline earth metal modified ZSM-5 zeolites
Wakui et al. investigated the effect of alkaline earth metal (i.e. Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) modification on the performance of HZSM-5 in the catalytic cracking of n-butane. The zeolites were modified by the addition of carbonate salt (AE(CO3)) of each alkaline earth to the aqueous solution used for the synthesis of the zeolite. The higher yield of ethylene and propylene was observed by using the alkaline earth modified ZSM-5 zeolites compared with the non-modified HZSM-5 (
Table 3
). The favorable results
were obtained over Ba/ZSM-5
[89]
. The stability of the modified catalyst was not reported by the authors

4.3.2. Transition metal modified ZSM-5 zeolites
The performance of Fe/HZSM-5
[91]
and Cr/HZSM-5
[92]
zeolites in the catalytic cracking of isobutane (for light olefin elaboration) was firstly investigated by Lu et al. A very high catalytic activity and selectivity in the catalytic cracking of isobutane was attained over Fe/HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 32) and Cr/HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 32) catalysts loaded with a trace amount of 0.010 mmol/g Fe
[91]
and 0.004 mmol/g of Cr
[92]
, at 625 °C (incipient-wetness impregnation). The yield of total olefins
was 65.6% and 56.1% over Fe/and Cr/HZSM-5 zeolites, respectively. The high yields of ethylene and propylene reached 24.6% and 32.4% over Fe/HZSM-5 zeolites at 625 °C (
Table 3
)
[91]
. The presence of a small amount of Fe or Cr could be favorable for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene which will be easily cracked to light olefins
[91]
,
[92]
. The selectivity of butene will be enhanced in the dehydrogenative cracking of C4 alkanes occur over cobalt oxide-impregnated HZSM-5 (5%Co/ZSM-5)
[89]
. Moreover, the ZSM-5 zeolites (Si/Al = 200) modified with transition metals, such as Cu, Zn, and Ag increase the yield of aromatics and reduce the
yield in catalytic cracking of C4 alkanes
[3]
.
4.3.3. Rare earth (RE) element modified ZSM-5 zeolites
The effects of rare earth on the structure, acidity, and catalytic performance of HZSM-5 zeolite were investigated by Wang et al. with the aim of light olefin production. The performance of RE (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd)/HZSM-5 (Si/A1 = 64.1) catalysts (impregnating with an aqueous solution of RE(NO3)3) was evaluated in the catalytic cracking of mixed C4 alkanes
[93]
. The optimal propylene yield at 600 °C reached 25.9%, 25.2%, and 25.2% over Nd/HZSM-5, Ce/HZSM-5, and La/HZSM-5, respectively. The best total alkene yield was achieved over Ce/HZSM-5 (57.2 wt.%) at 600 °C, and Nd/HZSM-5 (60.0 wt.%), at 650 °C
[93]
. The ratio of P/E differs obviously according to the reaction temperature and the type of incorporated rare earth element (
Table 3
). The results revealed that RE-modified HZSM-5 catalyst significantly enhances the selectivity to light olefins; thus, the yield of olefins increases and the yield of aromatics decreases greatly in the catalytic cracking of butane. The loading of the rare earth metals in HZSM-5 sample promotes the performance of HZSM-5 (Section
5.4
) in the catalytic cracking of butane
[93]
. Moreover, Wakui et al. reported an overall
yield of 48 wt.% at 650 °C in the catalytic cracking of n-butane over La impregnated HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 200) catalysts
[94]
. The yield of
rises to 58% at 650 °C by suggesting a dehydrogenation-cracking double-stage reaction with employing a Pt–Sn type dehydrogenation catalyst and a cracking catalyst (RE-loaded HZSM-5)
[95]
. In the proposed process, n-butane is firstly dehydrogenated to n-butene (1- and 2-butene) over the Pt–Sn/Ca–ZnAl2O4 as a dehydrogenation catalyst (loaded at the upper part of the reactor), then n-butene is successively converted to ethylene and propylene over 10%Pr/ZSM-5 as a cracking catalyst (loaded at the lower part of the reactor)
[95]
.
4.3.4. Phosphorus modified ZSM-5 zeolites
Although phosphorus modification is the most commonly used method employed to improve HZSM-5 zeolites performance, the catalytic cracking of C4 alkanes for producing light olefins over P-modified (incipient-wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of (NH4)2HPO4) HZSM-5 catalyst is seldom reported so far
[96]
. Jiang et al. investigated the efficiency of P-modified HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25) in the catalytic cracking of mixed C4 alkanes to increase the yield of ethylene and propylene
[96]
. At the temperature of 650 °C, the maximum yields of propylene and ethylene reached to 25.6 and 33.9 wt.%, which were higher than those over parent HZSM-5 by 7 and 4.5 wt.%, respectively
[96]
. On the contrary, Wakui et al. observed that ethylene and propylene yields diminished over P/ZSM-5 (2 wt.% P-loading) in the catalytic cracking of n-butane at 650 °C; however, the conversion over P/ZSM-5 was rather stable for 5 h. They observed that the loaded phosphorus created a negative effect on the cracking activity (
Table 3
)
[94]
. Anyway, the favorable results were achieved over 2%P–10%La/HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 200) zeolite prepared by impregnating with the aqueous solutions of La(CH3COO)3·1.5H2O and (NH4)2HPO4, respectively
[94]
. The results of light olefins in the catalytic cracking of C4 alkanes over modified ZSM-5 zeolites (fixed bed reactor) are summarized in
Table 3
.
4.3.5. HZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios
Acidity of the zeolites is largely dependent on their Si/Al molar ratios and the employed modifying promoters
[74]
. In general, the extremely high hydrothermal stability is closely related to the high Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 zeolite
[41]
,
[69]
. The low Al content in ZSM-5 framework limits the extent of aluminum extraction from the framework structure and reduces the occurrence of framework collapse during steam treatment
[69]
, so the stability of the crystal lattice enhances with increasing Si/Al ratio
[41]
,
[97]
. On dealumination, the number of acidic centers decreases, but the acidity of the remaining centers increases up to a degree of dealumination of ca. 50%. The opposite effects of the concentration of acid centers and their acid strength are superimposed, so that maximum reactivity is reached at a certain SiO2/Al2O3 ratio
[97]
.
The effects of Si/Al ratio on the performance of ZSM-5 catalyst for light olefin formation have been merely investigated by Lu et al. in C4 alkane catalytic cracking. They studied several systems of HZSM-5, Fe/HZSM-5 and Cr/HZSM-5 zeolites with the different ratios of Si/Al (25, 38, 50, 80, and 150). The NH3–TPD results indicated that the total acid amounts, density, and strength of HZSM-5, Fe/HZSM-5, and Cr/HZSM-5 zeolites obviously decrease, while those of weak acid amounts enhance with reducing the Si/Al molar ratios. It was concluded that when the ratio of Si/Al was less than 50, the three systems of HZSM-5, Fe/HZSM-5, and Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts with the same ratio of Si/Al gave similar and high isobutane conversions. However, these three systems of catalysts possess different altering tendencies of isobutane conversions for the ratios of Si/Al ≥ 80. The higher ratios of Si/Al (≥80) are beneficial to improve the yields of light olefins
over Fe/HZSM-5 and Cr/HZSM-5 zeolites (
Table 3
)
[98]
. The results reported on the catalytic performances of HZSM-5, Fe/HZSM-5, and Cr/HZSM-5 zeolites with different molar ratios of Si/Al, are not in agreement with each other at the mentioned temperatures (550–600 °C); furthermore, it is not possible to specify the optimum Si/Al ratio that favors the yield of each light olefin, i.e. ethylene, propylene, and butene. For example, at the temperature of 550 °C, the highest yield of light olefins (59.8 wt.%) over Cr/HZSM-5 zeolite was achieved using Si/Al ratio of 150, while over Fe/HZSM-5 and HZSM-5 the ratios of 80 and 50 resulted in the highest yields of light olefins (54.6 wt.% and 50.8 wt.%, respectively). Generally, the yield of BTX abated in all the samples by increasing the Si/Al ratios, so hydride transfer and aromatization are suppressed by keeping the number of acid sites low.
The influence of Si/Al ratio on light olefin production is also investigated in the catalytic cracking of other feedstocks reported in this paper. Jung et al. observed that enhancing the Si/Al molar ratio of ZSM-5 (25, 75 and 100) zeolites induces a significant decrease in the conversion of n-octane, at the temperature range of 200–600 °C. The selectivity for olefin slowly increases with elevating the reaction temperature regardless of their Si/Al molar ratio. Thus, the number of strong acid sites influences on the conversion considerably, but not in selectivity
[74]
. Abrevaya reported that by increasing the Si/Al ratio from 24 to 66, hydride transfer and aromatization reactions are lowered
[68]
. Zhu et al. studied the impact of Si/Al ratio in the catalytic cracking of butene to propylene over ZSM-5 zeolites, and proposed that both the propylene selectivity and the overall yield of propylene and ethylene increased with ascending the Si/Al2 ratio
[99]
. Furthermore, the stabilities of the catalysts are effectively prolonged with enhancing the Si/Al ratios. For the ZSM-5 (Si/Al2 = 50), the conversion decreased from an initial value of 96.6–67.5%, i.e. 29% lower in 10 h of running, while for the ZSM-5 (Si/Al2 = 366) the conversion changed from 84.5 to 81.4% (a decrease of only 3%)
[99]
. In contrast to the aforementioned conclusions, Han et al. observed that as the Si/A1 ratio decreased from 75 to 20, the yield of
increased from 29.3% to 37.5%
[7]
.
4.4. Hydrocarbons lighter than C4
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrialized process for the production of propylene
[30]
that employs different types of catalysts, e.g., Platinum–tin-based (Pt–Sn) promoters supported on alumina
[100]
,
[101]
, silica, ZSM-5
[102]
,
[103]
,
[104]
,
[105]
, SAPO-34
[106]
,
[107]
, etc. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane and propane over different types of catalysts including modified zeolites such as Ga2O3/HZSM-5
[108]
, ZnO/HZSM-5
[109]
, etc., is another route for light olefin production that has been widely studied
[110]
,
[111]
,
[112]
,
[113]
,
[114]
,
[115]
,
[116]
. The mentioned processes are out of the scope in the current paper.
To the best of our knowledge, the non-oxidative catalytic cracking of propane and ethane has not been resulted in high conversion of light olefins. However, the transformation of propane over modified zeolites (e.g., Pt, Co, Zn, Ga, etc.) has been intensively reported in literature
[117]
,
[118]
,
[119]
,
[120]
. The main feature of the proposed conversion mechanism involves propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization
[121]
,
[122]
. Metals induce the dehydrogenating properties of the material whereas acid sites are responsible for the oligomerization of the dehydrogenation products (bifunctional mechanism)
[119]
. Propane activation mechanism and cracking for light olefin production over Ga oxide and Al oxide modified HZSM-5 zeolites depicts that the preference for C–H bond activation over Ga cations results in high propylene selectivities of more than 85% over Ga+ modified HZSM-5
[120]
,
[123]
. The faujasite structure zeolites type-X and the USY exchanged with copper, iron, and platinum have been used in propane transformation at 400 and 550 °C. The highest propane dehydrogenation activity has been achieved with the platinum-exchanged X zeolite (propylene yield ∼11.2%, selectivity ∼31%). USY zeolites show high cracking capability and relatively low dehydrogenation activity
[119]
.
Ethane aromatization has been also investigated extensively over zeolites modified with metal cations such as Ga and Zn
[124]
. The initial stage is the dehydrogenation of ethane that proceeds with subsequent oligomerization and dehydrocyclization
[125]
,
[126]
. Different ideas regarding the nature of metal cations on the catalyst surface, as well as the effect of the incorporated element including the enhancement of ethane conversion, increasing the initial formation of olefins, and retarding the deactivation by coke formation have been proposed in literature. The mechanistic considerations such as the occurrence of a bifunctional mechanism over the modified zeolite and/or competing of the reactants and the intermediates for the same acidic sites are also another issues
[127]
. The theoretical calculations have been focused on the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation and the nature of intermediates and transition states over modified zeolites. The probability of the alkyl rupture of the ethane C–H bond or the carbenium activation have been predicted by estimating the activation energies
[128]
,
[129]
.
4.5. Concluding remarks
One of the advantages of catalytic cracking process, compared to the conventional steam cracking, is that the feedstocks type is not as prominent as steam cracking. A flexible product distribution, such as more light olefins, BTX or both of them could be achieved over modified ZSM-5 catalysts with a suitable strength and density of acidity in the catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons (
Table 2
,
Table 3
). Another improvement is that the P/E ratio is adjustable by choosing the appropriate catalyst (
Table 2
,
Table 3
).
Unfortunately, in the steam cracking process, ethane feedstock does not typically give enough propylene to be recovered. The amount of propylene produced from propane, butane or even naphtha cracking is less than half that of the ethylene yields as shown in

The data reported in
Table 2

Table 3
depict that the ratio of P/E differs significantly, according to the reaction temperature and the type of incorporated element. The catalytic cracking process has overcome the low P/E ratio disadvantage of steam cracking; given that, the ratios are higher than 0.58 in all the modified zeolites, and vary in the range of 1.8–1.33 over F-, Fe-, Cr-, P-modified HZSM-5 zeolites. The promoters that accelerate dehydrogenative cracking of hydrocarbons, such as F, Cr and Fe, are shown to increase the ratio of P/E.
Fig. 2
shows the variation of P/E (1.7–0.9) ratios versus the modified HZSM-5 zeolite samples in the catalytic cracking of C4 alkanes. The ratio of P/E can be altered by adjusting the zeolite structure and the acidity, i.e., type, strength, and distribution
[131]
. In most of the samples, the yield of ethylene increases but the propylene yield decreases by elevating the temperature. The selectivity for propylene is generally dependent on the extent of the reaction: the selectivity for propylene is usually high at low conversion, while that for ethylene becomes higher with increasing the conversion.

[91]
, at 600–625 °C (∼32–33 wt.%). The yield of ethylene (∼31–31.9 wt.%) over Cr/HZSM-5 zeolite at 600 °C is also favorable. However, the highest total olefins as well as
yields have been obtained over Fe/HZSM-5 and Cr/HZSM-5. In the catalytic cracking of naphtha, the highest yield of propylene is observed over F/HZSM-5 (36–33.8 wt.%), while that of ethylene is produced over La/HZSM-5 and La-P/HZSM-5 (38–32 wt.%); La-P/HZSM-5 is the most stable catalyst with the highest yield of
(62 wt.%).
Investigating the yield of light olefins versus the corresponding Si/Al ratios (
Table 3
) elucidates that they do not follow any trend, generally. The highest yields of total olefin are observed over the wide range of Si/Al ratios from 32 to 200. It is noteworthy that the operating conditions are not identical in the reported data; consequently, comparing these data does not specifically elicit the impact of this property. Nevertheless, the values of BTX yield have not exceeded 5 wt.% at the highest Si/Al ratios (200), and as the Si/Al ratio increases the yield of BTX decreases over the modified HZSM-5 zeolites. Higher Si/Al ratios hinder the bimolecular hydrogen transfer reactions.
The important job in designing a catalyst is to optimize the balance between the number/strength of acid sites and the type/amount of metals in the modified H-ZSM-5 for maximization of light alkenes with relatively low coke formation and catalyst stability.
5. Effect of element modification on the performance of ZSM-5
The effect of ZSM-5 zeolite modification on the selectivity of favorable products can be studied considering various approaches. The appropriate catalyst formulation (modification of ZSM-5) is one of the most important factors that influences directly on the yield of light olefins. The effect of various elements on the chemical properties of ZSM-5 zeolite, and their impacts on light olefin production are reported in this section.
A complete and detailed review of all modifications, which zeolites may sustain has been published by Kühl
[132]
. The topic is comprehensive enough to be excluded from the scope of the current paper. The acid strength of zeolite varies over a wide range by the modification (e.g., ion exchange, impregnation, partial dealumination, and isomorphic substitution of the framework Al and Si atoms) with multivalent cations. Brønsted acid centers are generally the catalytically active sites of H-zeolites
[97]
,
[132]
. Steaming is probably the oldest modifying treatment, since it has been known since the mid 1960s. By steaming or acid extraction, part of the zeolite can be dissolved or restructured leaving a mesoporous system in addition to the microporous one, which may be of importance in the transport of reactants or products and thus the conversion of relatively large molecules which may be present in a feedstock
[133]
. The hydroxyaluminate species formed by steaming are potential Lewis acid sites, since the environment of the corresponding aluminums is octahedral
[39]
.
5.1. Acidity of zeolites
The global acidity of a given zeolite is the result, amongst other things, of two parameters characteristic of Brønsted sites, i.e., their density (or their concentration) and their strength
[39]
. The density of Brønsted acid sites decreases when the Si/Al ratio of the zeolitic framework increases
[39]
,
[41]
,
[133]
,
[134]
, since the ion-exchange capacity corresponds to the Al3+ content of the zeolites
[41]
,
[97]
. The zeolites are classified according to increasing Si/Al ratio and the associated acid/base properties (
Table 4
).
Table 4. Classification of acidic zeolites according to increasing Si/Al ratio

The strength of the Brønsted sites depends on the interaction between the proton and the zeolitic framework or the environment of the framework Al
[39]
. A completely isolated Al tetrahedron will create the strongest type of Brønsted acid site
[134]
. The two main parameters governing the acid strength of the Brønsted sites are the structural characteristics of the zeolite and its chemical composition. The structural characteristic of the zeolite is related to the proton lability that depends on the angle formed between the two adjacent tetrahedra T at the oxygen carrying the proton
[39]
. Regarding the chemical composition factor, the acid strength depends on the number of Al atoms (aluminate tetrahedral) that are adjacent to a silanol (silicate tetrahedron) group
[39]
,
[41]
,
[97]
. The highest proton-donor strengths are exhibited by zeolites with the lowest concentrations of
tetrahedra such as HZSM-5 and the ultrastable zeolite HY
[41]
,
[97]
.
The strength of the Brønsted acid sites (intrinsic acidity) is also affected by isomorphic substitution
[133]
,
[134]
. The acid strength depends on the type of heteroatom; gallium or iron zeolites are much less acidic than aluminum zeolites. Boron-substituted for Si in pentasil ZSM-5 zeolites was observed to yield very weak acidity strength
[133]
,
[135]
, although, it results in an excellent catalyst for isomerization
[136]
. Ga substituted ZSM-5 samples was shown to exhibit both acidic and dehydrogenation properties
[136]
.
The Lewis acid sites are related to the formation of positively charged oxide clusters or ions within the porous structures of the zeolites
[137]
. They are usually associated with extra framework Al (EFAL) species formed by extraction of aluminum from the lattice
[39]
,
[134]
,
[138]
, or metal ions exchanged for the protons of acid sites. These metal cations together with the adjacent framework oxygens will act as Lewis acid/base pair, and may polarize bonds in reacting molecules
[137]
. It has been also suggested that the extra-framework trivalent Al species (formation of hydroxyaluminate species in the microporosity) reduce the concentration of Brønsted acid sites in the framework, simultaneously
[39]
increase their acid strength if the initial Si/Al ratio is not too high (<7)
[39]
,
[79]
,
[120]
. In general, the presence of Lewis acid sites could increase the strength of the nearby OH Brønsted acid sites, due to an inductive or a synergistic effect between the Brønsted and the Lewis acid sites
[39]
,
[79]
.
5.2. Alkali and alkaline earth metals
Exchanging zeolites with a less electronegative charge-balancing cation such as Cs+ and/or occlusion of alkali metal oxide clusters or alkali metal clusters in zeolite cages makes the zeolites basic. Basic zeolites contain either Lewis base sites associated with the framework oxygen ions, or Brønsted base sites linked to basic hydroxyl groups, or both. The former is influenced by the negative charge of the oxygen, while the latter depends on the nature of extra framework cation present in the zeolite. The base strength of the zeolite rises with increasing the aluminum content of the framework (i.e. ZSM-5 < mordenite < L < Y < X) and reduces with decreasing the ionic radius of the exchanged cation (e.g. Li < Na < K < Rb < Cs). It is also influenced by the exchange of Al and/or Si ions in the zeolite framework for Ga and/or Ge, respectively
[134]
.
One of the roles of the alkaline earth metals is the modification of acid character by weakening acid strength or reducing acid sites
[90]
. The NH3–TPD spectra of the alkaline earth modified HZSM-5 catalysts indicated that the strong acid sites are transformed to weak acid sites by the introduction of alkaline earth metals
[90]
. The amount of strong acid sites reduces with the alkaline earth modification by increasing the ionic radius with the order of nonmodified (H form) ≫ Mg > Ca > Sr > Ba
[90]
,
[97]
. Barium as the strongest Lewis base in alkaline earths series resulted in the highest yield of light olefins
[90]
. Tynjala et al. proposed that the rapid decrement of strong Brønsted acid sites with increasing the degree of Ba ion-exchange is due to quite negligible effect of the Plank–Hirschler mechanism. The ion-exchange of zeolites with di- and trivalent metal cations leads to the formation of metal hydrate cations
and
, respectively. H MAS NMR spectra showed that the intensity of the Brønsted acid site signal also decreased as the degree of ion-exchange increased
[139]
.
The modification of ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts with the elements enhancing the surface basicity decreases the readsorption of the basic compounds of the cracking products, such as ethylene, propylene, and butenes, and this is apparently the major cause of the lower aromatics and higher light olefin formation
[3]
. On the other hand, the alkaline earth metal modified HZSM-5 zeolite suppresses hydrogen transfer reaction and stimulates the dehydrogenative cracking by controlling the HZSM-5 acid character and dehydrogenation activity to improve the yield of light olefins
[89]
.
The alkali treatment of zeolites induces a significant change in their acidity and pore structure because silica and alumina of the framework are dissolved in alkaline solution
[40]
. The dissolution of alumina removes aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework; thus, results in the loss of strong acid sites and destruction of zeolite structure
[40]
. The thermal and hydrothermal stabilities of the alkali-treated ZSM-5 zeolites are slightly deteriorated because of the introduction of mesopores caused by the desilication
[140]
. Weak alkali solutions dissolve a small amount of silica and alumina, so create mesopores
[6]
,
[40]
,
[141]
by enlarging the micropores of zeolites, while strong alkali solutions destroy their crystal structure; therefore, convert them to amorphous materials with macropores and extremely small acid sites
[40]
. Ogura et al. reported that the microporous structure remained unchanged in Na/ZSM-5 zeolite, but the acidic property altered very little quantitatively or qualitatively
[141]
. The textural properties analyzed by Wei et al. indicated that the surface area and pore volume of micropores decrease to some extent
[6]
. Alkali modified zeolites, usually Na and K, are not recommended by some authors, because of the deactivating effect of them in most of the catalytic reactions and hydrocarbon transformations
[36]
,
[38]
. The alkali treatment is not effective in enhancing the overall selectivity to alkenes, but the selectivity for propylene is high because of the rapid elution of primary cracking products
[40]
. On the contrary, it was observed that the loss of strong acid sites due to alkali treatment suppresses the production of longer alkanes such as hexane and heptane by reducing further oligomerization
[40]
. Wang et al. deduced that the role of K and Ba is to enhance the dehydrogenation activity of the catalysts and minimize the bimolecular hydrogen transfer reaction, which is responsible for the saturation of small olefins and the formation of aromatics
[83]
.
5.3. Transition metals
Transition metals have partially occupied d-orbitals the symmetry of which is suitable for formation of chemical bonds with neutral molecules. These metals also have several stable oxidation states and different coordination numbers as a result of the changes in the number of d-electrons
[142]
. The catalysis by organometallic compounds is based on activation of the substrates by coordinating it to the metal, which lowers the activation energy of the reaction between substrates. Organometallic catalysts also include specific ligands besides the atom or group of metal atoms. A very large number of different types of ligands can coordinate to transition metal ions. Once the ligands are coordinated, the reactivity of the metals may change dramatically. The rate and selectivity of a given process can be optimized to the desired level by controlling the ligand environment
[142]
. It is known that transition metals create new Lewis acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolites. The simultaneous presence of Brønsted and Lewis sites could increase the acid activity of zeolites and influence on the selectivity of the catalytic cracking products. The nature of Lewis sites, and how they impact catalyst performance in catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons are still not fully understood
[134]
.
The modification of ZSM-5 zeolites with transition metals adjusts the catalyst acidity. Lu et al. observed that the acidic amount of the Fe/HZSM-5 catalysts firstly increased with the introduction of a small amount of Fe, but it decreased with further enhancing the quantity of Fe(III). The higher loading amount of iron was proposed to lessen the catalytic cracking activity of Fe/HZSM-5 catalysts obviously, that might be due to the aggregation of a majority of iron into oxo-iron compounds with large domain size, which could cover the outer surface of the zeolite catalysts, or combine with acid sites
[91]
. The NH3–TPD analysis results of Cr/HZSM-5 indicated that the density of acid sites (weak and strong) enhance with increasing the loading amount of Cr(III), while the strength of strong acid sites obviously reduces
[92]
. It was postulated that the majority of Cr species in the catalysts are uniform, isolated, well dispersed, and almost oxidized to Cr(VI) after calcinations. The catalytic cracking reactivity of Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts decreases by rising the loading amount of Cr, that might be due to the existence of a majority of Cr(III) with large domain size, which could cover the outer surface of the zeolite catalysts, or combine with acid sites
[92]
. Enhancing the quantity of Fe or Cr in HZSM-5 leads to increasing the selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbon and decreasing the total olefins, because of improving further oligomerization and cyclization reactions
[91]
,
[92]
. A partially Cu-exchanged HZSM-5 provides with an optimum balance between dehydrogenation activity of the metal and acid function of the shape selective HZSM-5 zeolite, when employed as FCC catalyst additive for improving the yield of light olefins. Lappas et al. found that a small amount of copper ions, as hydrated Cu(I) or Cu(II) cations in ion-exchange sites, hinders framework dealumination during steaming compared to HZSM-5 or the Ga- and Cr-modified samples. The total number of acid sites of the Cu/HZSM-5 sample was also higher than the rest of the samples
[51]
. Kwak et al. observed that the addition of Zn by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) decreased the intensity of the Brønsted acidity, but it did not cause the apparent formation of Lewis acid sites, unlike Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts
[143]
. The reported results depict that Co
[89]
, Cu, Zn, and Ag
[3]
loaded sites on HZSM-5 zeolites accelerate the dehydrogenative cracking
[89]
and cyclo-dehydrogenation reaction
[3]
. Zhang et al. found that the hydrogen transfer capability of the transition metals suppressed in the presence of phosphorus, and the selectivity to light olefins were increased because of its dehydrogenation activity
[131]
.
As the aromatization reaction starts with dehydrogenation step and the formation of small olefins, the results obtained in this reaction are also applicable for studying the impact of element modification in improving the yield of light olefins. The incorporation of transition metal ions into zeolites leads to interesting bifunctional catalysts
[85]
in which metal and acid centers can act simultaneously
[97]
. The transition metals, such as Ni, Co, Zn, Cu, Cr, and Mn, introduced into pentasil type zeolites are generally used as active components for hydrogenation or dehydrogenation
[144]
,
[145]
or aromatization reactions
[121]
,
[122]
,
[131]
. The hypothesis of dehydrogenation enhancing role of Lewis acid in the initial stages of the cracking reactions have been supported by various researches. It results in the olefin formation that can initiate, or at least enhance the cracking reaction
[8]
,
[138]
.
The mechanism of hydrocarbon transformation over a modified zeolite could involve both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites
[84]
. The activation on a zeolite matrix should occur largely on strong Lewis acidic centers, while secondary cracking, on strong Brønsted centers
[146]
. It is also probable that both the incorporated element and zeolite protons intervene in hydrocarbon activation step
[143]
,
[147]
. In a true bifunctional catalyst such as Ga2O3/ZSM-5, the dehydrogenation and aromatization mainly occurs on metals, while oligomerization, cyclization, dealkylation, transalkylation, and isomerization of alkyl aromatics occur on zeolite
[42]
. Transition metals, e.g. Zn and Ga cations, are the driving force for dehydrogenation by combining the H-atoms that form during the activation of C–H at Brønsted acid sites due to the cyclic reduction and oxidation of Zn and Ga species
[148]
. Altogether, the combination of Lewis sites for the dehydrogenation of the paraffinic feedstock with Brønsted acid sites for the cracking of subsequent higher olefins to light olefins, could enhance the yield of light olefins
[8]
.
5.4. Rare earth elements
Rare earth is a generic name used for the 14 metallic elements of the Lanthanide series, which contain the atomic numbers from 57 through 71 plus Scandium (At. #21) and Yttrium (At. #39). These elements occupy a unique place in the periodic chart. They are the first elements where the increasing atomic number results in the filling of the inner electron shell after an outer shell has been filled, causing a high similarity in chemical properties
[149]
.
Rare earth cations such as La3+ and Ce3+ have been successfully employed in FCC so called zeolite Y (REY) catalysts to improve the ability of the catalyst to withstand high temperature, leading to the catalytic stability
[11]
,
[150]
, increasing catalyst activity and gasoline selectivity
[11]
,
[93]
. A higher concentration of acid sites will be found in the rare earth exchanged catalyst due to inhibiting the dealumination of the zeolite; consequently, both the activity and the hydrothermal stability of the catalyst will be improved
[149]
. The effects of rare earth elements on Y zeolites are still controversial. On one hand, they shift the cracking selectivity due to the reduction of hydrogen transfer to produce higher percentages of olefins, which will increase gasoline octane number
[150]
. On the other hand, as a result of the greater number of active sites, both the primary cracking and hydrogen transfer reactions that occur within the zeolite are enhanced
[149]
.
The influence of RE modification on the catalytic performances of ZSM-5 zeolite is also debatable. On one hand, some researchers have reported that the introduction of a rare earth metal ion into HZSM-5 has a great impact on its acidic properties
[93]
,
[151]
. Hartford et al. observed that lanthanum exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite alters the acidity by lowering the number of strong acid sites and increasing the number of weak acid sites (
Table 5
), but it does not reduce the effective free pore volume nor it enlarge steric hindrances for the passage of linear molecules through the pores of the catalyst
[151]
. Moreover, Wang et al. illustrated that the total amount of acid sites of light RE-modified HZSM-5 samples increases, compared to the unmodified HZSM-5 sample, except for the Gd-modified sample
[93]
. The orders of the amount of weak acid, strong acid, and total acid total acid have been observed as follows: Sm >Nd > Pr > Eu > Ce > La > HZSM-5 > Gd; Nd >Eu > La > Sm > Ce > Pr > Gd > HZSM-5; Nd > Sm > Eu > Pr > Ce > La > HZSM-5 > Gd (
Table 5
)
[93]
. On the contrary, Xue et al. deduced that adding La to HZSM-5 zeolite decreases the total amount of Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite. This elimination was probably caused by the exchange of La3+ ion with bridged hydroxyls in zeolite; although, some new acid sites might be generated by splitting the coordinated water molecules with La3+ ions. The density of Brønsted acid sites in La/HZSM-5 decreases with the increase in La loadings
[66]
. The acid amount of RE/HZSM-5 after NH3–TPD measurement is listed in
Table 5
.

[152]
.
The presence of the empty f orbital in rare earth metals is essential to modify the acidity of HZSM-5 zeolites because it can at least provide some positions for the formation of Lewis acidic sites
[93]
. The detailed results of the FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on the RE-modified HZSM-5 zeolites are reported in
Table 6
. The results indicate that Brønsted and Lewis acid sites coexist on all the studied samples. The modification of HZSM-5 zeolite with rare earth metals not only amend the amount of acid sites but also alters the acid type, i.e., the ratio of L/B
[93]
.

[93]
On the other hand, it is generally accepted that the introduction of RE elements modifies the basicity of ZSM-5 zeolite as RE oxides usually possess some basic characters
[93]
. Yoshimura et al. and Wakui et al. observed that the acid amount and strength were almost the same before and after the La loading (10 wt.% loading) indicating that the modification of HZSM-5 with La did not affect the acidic character of the catalyst
[3]
,
[94]
. In contrast to the acidity, considerable changes were observed for the basicity measured by CO2–TPD. The amount of CO2 adsorption calculated from the peak at 70 °C enhanced as the quantity of La loading increased, suggesting the generation of basic sites on the surface as a result of La-loading
[3]
. Wakui et al. illustrated that as the amount of La-loaded increases, the olefin adsorption over La/HZSM-5 zeolites decreases; thus, the main reason for the higher yield of ethylene and propylene is inhibiting the bimolecular reactions due to the suppression of olefin adsorption
[89]
,
[95]
. The introduction of RE elements modifies the basicity of ZSM-5 zeolite
[3]
,
[93]
; hence, decreases the readsorption of the basic compounds of the cracking products, such as ethylene, propylene, and butenes, which is one of the major causes of higher light olefin formation.
5.5. Phosphorus
Phosphorus modification is the most widely used method that has been applied for improving HZSM-5 zeolites performance
[96]
. Researchers at Mobil where among the first to recognize the benefits of phosphorus
[49]
for improving the hydrothermal stability and shape selectivity of ZSM-5 zeolites
[49]
,
[152]
,
[153]
. Phosphorus stabilizes the lattice aluminum ions by retarding aluminum from leaving the zeolite framework; thus, it hinders structural changes of zeolite that significantly results in enhancing the stability of the catalyst
[3]
,
[5]
,
[49]
,
[152]
,
[153]
. Degnan et al. have summarized that phosphorus reduces the initial acidity of the zeolite, but after severe steaming produces a zeolite that retains a larger fraction of its acidity
[49]
. The stabilization of cracking activity is entirely due to the improved retention of framework aluminum in ZSM-5
[49]
. Lercher et al. proposed that the phosphorus species interact with the oxygen of the bridging hydroxyl groups by replacing the protons on them and result in the cleavage of the Al–O bonding and the opening of the zeolite framework
[154]
. When phosphorus reacts with zeolite, the hydroxyl connected with aluminum atoms on the zeolite surfaces is replaced by P–OH, so the acid strength is weakened because the strength of P–OH is weaker than that of Al–OH
[154]
. Xue et al. used various experimental techniques to demonstrate the influences of hydrothermal treatment on the Brønsted acid sites of the HZSM-5 impregnated by phosphorus. The interaction of phosphorus species with silanol nests exposed on the zeolite (due to dealumination) creates new hydrothermally stable acid sites during the steam treatment
[152]
. The new acid sites seem to be related to the phosphorus entering into the zeolitic position left by dealumination and stabilized by some extra-lattice aluminum. The entry of phosphorus into the zeolitic framework protects the residual framework aluminum against further dealumination. The integrated effect causes the hydrothermally stable acid sites in P/HZSM-5
[152]
. The Phosphorous–zeolite interaction is also proposed to stabilize the framework aluminum pairs by extra-framework cationic species formed via protonation of orthophosphoric acid
[155]
.
Altogether, the modification of HZSM-5 zeolite with phosphorus decreases Brønsted acidity
[5]
,
[153]
,
[156]
; and/or converts strong Brønsted acid sites of HZSM-5 into weak Brønsted acid sites that increases the density of the weak Brønsted acid sites without changing the overall acid–base properties
[154]
,
[157]
. On the other hand, it is reported that the concentration of both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites are significantly decreased in P/HZSM-5 zeolites, at the same desorption temperature. Brønsted and Lewis acid sites dropped with increasing the desorption temperature (from 100 to 300 °C)
[158]
. It is suggested that during calcinations, some of the Brønsted acid sites are neutralized by attaching P species, and subsequent hydrothermal treatment of P/HZSM-5 converts the P species to more condensed phase which block pores of zeolite reversibly

Reducing the Brønsted acidity of P/HZSM-5 provides a pathway for reaction to occur with enhanced light olefin production
[5]
. The introduction of P in HZSM-5 increases the selectivity to propylene and butenes in the catalytic cracking of n-decane
[155]
. The incorporated phosphorous species are responsible for both the enhanced acid stability, and the significantly improved catalytic performance in the cracking of C4 olefin to propylene and ethylene
[152]
. Zhao et al. supported the idea that the P-impregnated HZSM-5 zeolites improve the propylene selectivity greatly and result in excellent anti-coking ability (lifetime exceeding 800 h on a single process) in the catalytic cracking of C4 olefin
[158]
. Liu et al. concluded that P/HZSM-5 leads to higher yields of light olefin (i.e., ethylene and propylene) in the catalytic cracking of naphtha
[153]
.
On the other hand, the introduction of phosphorus not only modulates the amount of acidic sites and the percentage of weak acidic sites in total acidic sites but also regulates the ratio of L/B (
Table 8
), which are favorable for obtaining the high yield of propylene in the catalytic cracking of C4 alkanes. The results showed that the new basic sites generated on the surfaces of P/HZSM-5 catalysts inhibit the adsorption of intermediate olefins and lower the formation of aromatics. The results of the P/HZSM-5 catalyst stability test indicated that there was an insignificant decrease in the conversion of the mixed C4 alkanes after 10.5 h continuous reaction, while the yield of ethylene plus propylene exhibited a slight enhancement

6. Mechanism of catalytic cracking over zeolites
The present paper does not intend to go through the suggested mechanisms of hydrocarbon catalytic cracking as some extensive reviews have been already published in this field
[28]
,
[138]
,
[159]
,
[160]
,
[161]
. The catalytic cracking reaction scheme and the influence of various factors on the contribution of each mechanism have been summarized in this section.
Alkanes can be activated by two mechanisms: monomolecular and bimolecular mechanisms. In the monomolecular (protolytic cracking) mechanism, proposed by Haag and Dessau in 1984
[162]
, alkanes are protonated to form carbonium ion transition states that can undergo either C–C bond cleavage yielding alkanes (including methane and ethane) or C–H bond cleavage yielding hydrogen and carbenium ions. These carbenium ions subsequently form alkenes via back donation of a proton to the zeolite. The formation of ethylene is possible via this mechanism (
Fig. 3
)
[28]
,
[68]
,
[77]
. In the bimolecular mechanism, cracking takes place when branched secondary and tertiary alkylcarbenium ions derived from the feed molecule are cleaved by a single beta-scission into smaller alkylcarbenium ions and alkenes (

.
The formation of primary alkylcarbenium ions is unlikely, so ethylene, ethane and methane are not observed via this mechanism. Bimolecular hydride transfer reactions between alkylcarbenium ions and feed alkanes lead to chain reactions that produce shorter alkanes thus limiting the yield of olefins to 50 wt.%
[28]
,
[77]
.
6.1. The factors determining the dominant mechanism
The protolytic cracking mechanism allows the formation of large quantities of ethylene and propylene from naphtha range reactants, provided that the bimolecular hydride transfer and aromatization reactions, which will consume ethylene and propylene are hindered
[68]
. The zeolite structure (e.g. the pore size and shape) and chemical properties (i.e. the promoter type, the acidity, and Si/Al ratio), as well as the operating condition directly influence on the contribution of the mentioned reaction schemes in the system. The monomolecular mechanism is dominant in the medium pore shape selective zeolites, i.e. ZSM-5

over strong proton sites of low density

[46]

[88]

[165]
. The ZSM-5 zeolite improves the production of light olefins, particularly propylene. Its shape selectivity affects on the catalyst performance in two ways. (1) Reactant state selectivity (RSS), so that the linear and monobranched paraffinic structures and even more the olefinic structures are converted into smaller fragments (C4−) in the microporosity. (2) Transition state selectivity (TSS) which acts in two ways in the ZSM-5: first, it prevents the formation of the transition state needed for the transfer of hydrogen; second, it hinders the formation of coke in the microporosity of the zeolite. The role of shape selectivity is often more important than their acidity
[33]
.
The various reactions rely in different ways on the strength and local structure of the Brønsted acid sites in zeolites. The activity of Brønsted acid sites in zeolites is strongly affected by the rate-limiting step of the reaction. The monomolecular cracking of alkanes proceeds via protonation of the alkane as the rate-limiting step. This reaction is influenced by the size and shape of the pores that impact the heat of adsorption
[165]
. Previous studies support this idea and declare that the differences in the heat of adsorption, and thus the size and shape of the pores, are the dominant factors in determining the cracking activity of the Brønsted acid sites
[79]
,
[165]
,
[166]
. High Brønsted acid site density decreases the activation energy
[167]
; consequently, results in high rate of hydride transfer and stable alkylation catalysts
[167]
,
[168]
.
The rate-limiting step in dehydrogenation of alkanes is the desorption of intermediate species, that is determined by the stability of these species
[169]
. This stability depends on the local structure of the Brønsted acid site and the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite framework
[165]
. Thus, changes in zeolite structure and such properties as the Si/Al ratio, framework ionicity, and framework flexibility, strongly influence the stability of the intermediate species
[165]
. Higher Si/Al ratio of zeolite decelerates the rate of hydride transfer reactions
[168]
.
6.2. The role of incorporated element in the catalytic cracking mechanism
Determining the precise role of incorporated element in the reaction steps is not simple, especially when the nature of the active metal species such as Ga remains unclear
[123]
. The effect of zeolite modification on the catalytic cracking is still under investigation, from the mechanistic point of view. Some relevant ideas regarding the role of incorporated element in the catalytic cracking reaction scheme have been summarized in this subsection.
Alternative to the conversion of hydrocarbons over Brønsted acid sites is their activation over Lewis acid sites. A distinct difference exists in the product distribution between Brønsted and Lewis sites. The former mainly catalyze C–C cracking reactions while the latter exhibits a strong preference for C–H activation and to a greater extent dehydrogenation
[123]
. The further cracking of the carbenium ion resulted from C–C cleavage increases the olefins-to-paraffin ratio compared to unity for Brønsted acid sites
[8]
. When bimolecular hydride transfer is limited as for HZSM-5, one predicts olefin-to-paraffin ratios of about 2
[163]
. Doronin et al. considered that activation on a zeolite matrix should occur largely on strong Lewis acidic centers, while secondary cracking, on strong Brønsted centers
[146]
. Biscardi et al.
[170]
and Yu et al.
[118]
suggested that the predominant role of extra-framework cations like Zn and Co in Zn/HZSM-5 and Co/HZSM-5 is to enhance the recombinative desorption of hydrogen, that increases the rate of dehydrogenation compared to HZSM-5. This process consumes the surface hydrogen pool available for the reverse hydrogenation reactions, and it increases the overall rate of propylene conversion to aromatics. Zn and Co cations promote not only alkane dehydrogenation but also the subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2, leading to unsaturated intermediates required in cyclization steps
[118]
,
[170]
. Feller et al. proposed that the activation of propane over Ga-containing zeolites occurs via a pseudo-protonated cyclopropane intermediate involving both protons and Ga+ species
[8]
,
[168]
. The recent experimental and theoretical work have shown that Lewis sites such as Ga+ species activate paraffins via heterolytic dissociation, over the Lewis acid–base pair formed by the univalent Ga+ ion and the zeolite oxygen anion
[123]
, that differs from the activation of paraffins over HZSM-5 via a carbonium ion mechanism
[120]
. Kazansky et al. concluded that hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by Zn and Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms. The role of Zn2+ in Zn/ZSM-5 is the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane forming an alkyl group and a Brønsted acid site, while Ga2+ results in dissociative adsorption of hydrocarbon
[171]
. Furthermore, Hensen et al. illustrated that over Ga cations, heterolytic dissociation of propane takes place on the Lewis acid base pair formed by the Ga+ ion and the zeolite oxygen anion that leads to high propylene production. Similarly, propane gives propylene over the acid–base pair of GaO+ via a lower energy barrier
[120]
. Rane et al. suggested that the synergy between Ga dehydrogenation sites and Brønsted acid sites improve the dehydrogenation rate; the high acidity of the zeolitic proton facilitates hydrogen recombination and concomitant removal of product olefin from the Ga active sites. The promoter cations play a key role in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, and Brønsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins produced
[8]
.
7. Conclusion
Light olefin production through catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons has attracted researchers’ attention to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional steam cracking, such as the high reaction temperature, the great amount of CO2 emission, and the low P/E ratios (0.4–0.6). The use of a shape selective, tri-dimensional micropore structure HZSM-5 zeolite with the large specific surface area has led to promising results in the catalytic cracking of different types of hydrocarbons, i.e., heavy feedstocks, naphtha range feedstocks, and C4 alkanes, at 550–650 °C; that is about 200 °C lower than the steam cracking. The ethylene yield of 28–34% and propylene yield of 23–29% have been attained depending on the feed type and the operating condition that is improved by 7–10%, compared with steam cracking. Furthermore, the ratio of P/E could be improved to 1.8–0.6 by adjusting the acidity, i.e., the acid type, density, strength, and distribution (L/B), as well as the reaction temperature.
The appropriate modification, including the selection of a suitable promoter, the amount of loading and the modification method has direct impact on the ZSM-5 performance and the product distribution. The promoter controls the pore characteristics and shape-selectivity of ZSM-5 zeolite, as well as the acidity; moreover, it influences on the catalyst activity and hydrothermal stability. Alkaline and rare earth elements cations not only increase the surface basicity that results in reducing the readsorption of the basic compounds of the cracking products, such as ethylene, propylene, and butenes, but also enhance the dehydrogenation reaction, which are the major causes of light olefin formation. Transition metals alter the acid distribution, i.e., the ratio of L/B, regulate the concentration, and amend the strength of Brønsted acid sites. The role of Lewis acid sites in accelerating the dehydrogenation reaction combined to a synergistic effect that exists between the Brønsted and the Lewis acid sites, hinder the hydrogen transfer reaction, and improve the dehydrogenative cracking that consequently improve the yield of light olefins. Rare earth elements not only amend the acid strength and distribution but also enhance the surface basicity of ZSM-5 catalyst. The modification of ZSM-5 with phosphorus is the best compromise in terms of both improving the hydrothermal stability as well as adjusting the zeolite chemical properties.
The higher Si/Al (>80) ratios in ZSM-5 framework are beneficial because of the well-established impact of low Al content in limiting the extent of aluminum extraction from the framework structure
[69]
and thus, increasing the stability of the crystal lattice
[41]
,
[97]
. Moreover, the higher Si/Al ratios hinder the bimolecular reactions and prevent from the formation of BTX.
The mechanism of hydrocarbon transformation over a modified HZSM-5 zeolite could involve both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, so the reactant is under the influence of two different types of sites simultaneously: the incorporated element and the zeolite acid sites. The synergy between Brønsted acid sites and the sites created via modified elements is one of the essential factors in determining the dominant mechanism in the catalytic cracking reaction. The factors such as the zeolite chemical and physical properties and the operating condition also verify the contribution of the favorable reaction scheme in the system.
8. Future prospects
Naphtha has thus far been employed as the main feedstock for olefins productions. However, due to the sudden rise in the price of oil and shortage of current light crude, many nations in Europe, North America, and the Middle East have paid attention to producing light olefins via alternative potential feedstocks such as heavy crudes. Meanwhile, the investment in plant construction in the petrochemical industry has focused on the utilization of natural gas due to economical aspects. Although, it is expected that market demands for ethylene can be met by natural gas decomposition technology, but in the near future there will be a shortage of propylene supply
[10]
,
[60]
.
According to the mentioned reasons, future technologies such as the catalytic cracking will be required to fulfill forthcoming market demand. Therefore, the catalytic cracking process should satisfy not only the production of high amount of light olefins (ethylene and propylene) from low grade crude as a feedstock but also controllable ratios of P/E
[60]
,
[70]
. Thus, it is anticipated that the thermal cracking process will be gradually transformed to a catalytic process such as ACO that can efficiently produce both ethylene and propylene, reduce the reaction temperature, and adjust the product distribution
[7]
,
[60]
,
[63]
,
[68]
,
[70]
. Most of the currently used units and equipment in steam cracking processes can be utilized for this catalytic cracking process; hence, the new process has a high potential for commercialization.
However, large-scale production of light olefins using catalytic cracking has some obstacles. The catalyst should have enough activity, selectivity and stability for the production of light olefins; the other problem could be the production cost. During the last decade, research scientists have focused on developing a number of modified HZSM-5 zeolites with tuned acidities and optimized control of the catalyst pore size to maximize the selectivities, and minimize the by product and coke formation. The suitable catalysts for the catalytic cracking of paraffins should contain strong acid sites to initiate the cracking reaction by producing reactive intermediates and the specific pore structures to suppress the formation of large hydrocarbons. The high hydrothermal stability of the catalysts is also indispensable because the reaction is operated at high temperatures in the presence of steam
[74]
. The shape selective, tri-dimensional HZSM-5 zeolite with high Si/Al (>80) ratios has proven to be the best choice for light olefin production. Furthermore, the impact of phosphorus on enhancing the hydrothermal stability of the given catalyst is well-established, but it is not easy to specify the other concomitant promoter, exactly. Rare earth elements could be appropriate candidates because they can amend both the ZSM-5 acidity and basicity; thus, the dehydrogenation is accelerated, and the readsorption of olefinic basic products is hindered, simultaneously. Anyway, the La-P/HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 200) zeolite has been so far the best compromise in terms of both the high selectivity to light olefins and the appropriate stability for the catalytic cracking of naphtha feedstock. The promoters that accelerate dehydrogenative cracking of hydrocarbons, such as Cr and Fe, are shown to increase the ratio of P/E in the catalytic cracking of C4 alkanes. Finally, to put the catalyst and the catalytic process to practical use, the following studies are needed: (a) test of catalytic performance on a pilot scale unit, (b) measurement and estimation of the catalyst life, (c) formation of catalysts with low pressure drop, and (d) optimization of the catalyst regeneration method
