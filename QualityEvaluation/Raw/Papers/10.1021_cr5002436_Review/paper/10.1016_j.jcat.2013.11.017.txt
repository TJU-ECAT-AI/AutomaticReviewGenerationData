The effects of composition and metal particle size of platinum catalysts on ethane dehydrogenation were
investigated on PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70 6 x 6 100) catalysts prepared with average particle sizes between
2 and 7 nm. At high conversions, catalyst deactivation from coke formation was a strong function of
particle size and Sn/Pt. Deactivation decreased signiﬁcantly with decreasing particle size and increasing
Sn addition. To understand the true initial activity of un-deactivated catalysts, further experiments were
run at low residence time conditions to limit ethene formation. For a ﬁxed average particle size, ethane
TOF and the selectivity to ethene increased with increasing content of Sn in the PtSn particle. For Pt and
Pt3Sn compositions, ethane TOF increased with increasing particle size, while the selectivity to ethene
was not strongly affected. The observed effects of particle size and composition are attributed to a com-
bination of geometric and electronic factors.

1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane has been widely inves-
tigated as an attractive alternative to steam cracking of naphtha for
the production of ethene, a key building block for the production of
chemicals and polymers [1,2]. The principal by-product of ethane
dehydrogenation is hydrogen, a vital commodity that can be used
for a variety of applications in a reﬁnery [3–5]. The most active cat-
alyst for ethane dehydrogenation is platinum; however, in its pure
form, it exhibits low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition,
which contributes to catalyst deactivation [6]. Isotopic studies
have revealed that both methane formation and coke accumulation
originate from ethene re-adsorption and dehydrogenation [6,7].
The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium,
to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene
selectivity and suppressing coke formation [6,8–11]. Both geomet-
ric and electronic effects of the second metals have been proposed
to explain their roles in modifying the catalyst surface and
changing the surface chemistry involved in ethane dehydrogena-
tion [12–19].
While there is a considerable literature on the inﬂuence of
additives on the activity, selectivity, and coke accumulation occur-
ring on Pt-bimetallic catalysts, a clear understanding of the sepa-
rate effects of metal particle size and composition has not been
previously reported [20–22]. The principal reason is that platinum
catalysts are usually prepared via impregnation of metal precur-
sors onto a support that are then reduced to form metallic parti-
cles. While such methods are simple and robust, they offer little
control over particle composition and size. A typical product pre-
pared in this way contains particles of different compositions and
sizes, the distribution of both variables depending upon the com-
position of the metal precursors and support and on the experi-
mental procedure [23–25]. Moreover, not all of the metal forms
an alloy with Pt, and consequently, a part of the additive is usually
present in one form or another on the support [9,23]. For these rea-
sons, it is hard to separate the effects of particle size and composi-
tion on catalytic performance, since the effects of both parameters
are usually entangled.
Furthermore, it has been observed that the initial deactivation
on Pt for ethane dehydrogenation is very fast [6,26]. Therefore, it
is very difﬁcult to measure the true initial activity of a pure Pt cat-
alyst and compare it with a promoted Pt catalyst exhibiting lower
initial deactivation. In order to determine whether the initial rate
of dehydrogenation on Pt is higher or lower than a bimetallic cat-
alyst, the amount of coke formation must be reduced. Since we
have shown from previous isotopic studies that coke originates pri-
marily from ethene, measuring rates at low conversions, or low
residence time conditions, will offer a strategy for obtaining the
true activity of Pt and Pt-bimetallic catalysts more accurately [6].
Similarly, measuring at low residence time conditions will provide
insight on the true initial activity of catalysts with varying particle
size, in the absence of signiﬁcant deactivation.

The aim of the present work was to identify and quantify the ef-
fects of particle size composition for Pt–Sn bimetallic nanoparticles
on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene. Particular attention
was given to the inﬂuence of these variables on the rate and selec-
tivity of ethene formation, the extent of coke accumulation, and
the extent of catalyst deactivation. To compare the true initial
activity of different catalysts, a low feed residence time was used.
A synthetic method was employed to make Pt–Sn particles of uni-
form size, which are then loaded onto a calcined hydrotalcite
(Mg(Al)O) support. Pt–Sn particles with similar size but different
compositions and with the same composition but different sizes
were prepared by adjusting the synthetic parameters. The results
of this study provide new insights into the roles of metal particle
size and composition on the properties of Pt–Sn nanoparticles for
ethane dehydrogenation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of platinum and platinum tin nanoparticles
Platinum nanoparticles were synthesized by reduction of plati-
num acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2, 97%, Aldrich) dissolved in octyl
ether (OE, 99%, Aldrich) by 1,2-hexadecanediol (HDD, 90%, Aldrich)
in the presence of oleylamine (OAm, 70%, Aldrich) and oleic acid
(OA, 99%, Aldrich) [27]. In a typical procedure, all of the compo-
nents were added to a 25-ml three-necked ﬂask, and the resulting
solution was heated to 563 K at a rate of 5 K/min and maintained at
this temperature for 30 min before cooling down to room temper-
ature. To produce Pt–Sn bimetallic particles, tin acetylacetonate
(Sn(acac)2, 99.9%, Aldrich) was added together with Pt(acac)2 at
the start of the procedure. All the experiments were conducted un-
der Ar using a standard Schlenk line. Pt particles with diameters
ranging between 2 and 8 nm, and composition, ranging in com-
position between Pt and Pt70Sn30, were obtained by adjusting the
molar ratio of Sn(acac)2/Pt(acac)2, the amounts of OAm and OA,
the temperature ramp rate, and the ﬁnal reaction temperature.
Upon completion of the nanoparticle preparation and cooling the
reaction mixture to room temperature, a large amount of anhy-
drous ethanol was added in order to aid the separation of the Pt
nanoparticles, which was achieved by centrifugation at 3000 rpm
for 5 min. The solid material produced in this manner was dis-
persed in anhydrous toluene to form a stable colloidal suspension.
Details concerning the preparation of all samples are listed in
Table S1.
2.2. Preparation of Mg(Al)O
Calcined hydrotalcite, namely Mg(Al)O, was used as a support
of the metal particles for its high thermal stability and moderate
basicity. Previous studies have shown that Mg(Al)O suppresses
thermal cracking of ethane and minimizes the formation of coke
on the support [28–31]. Hydrotalcite was prepared by co-precip-
itation and subsequent thermal treatment [6,20]. In a standard
procedure, magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)26H2O, Alfa Aesar, 98–
102%, 163.27 g) and aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)39H2O, Alfa Ae-
sar, 98–102%, 23.8 g) were ﬁrst dissolved in H2O (dionized,
700 mL).

99.5%, 3.36 g) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Fisher Scientiﬁc,
98.3%, 31.72 g) were dissolved in H2O (700 mL) in a separate
ﬂask. The two solutions were mixed drop-wise at 333 K with
constant stirring for 1 h. The precipitate was ﬁltered and washed
with excess H2O till a neutral pH value was achieved. The result-
ing material was dried overnight at 383 K and then heated to
973 K in air at a rate of 2 K/min and maintained at this temper-
ature overnight.
2.3. Preparation of PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70 6 x 6 100)
All
PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O
(70 6 x 6 100)
samples,
except
the
1.3 nm Pt/Mg(Al)O, were prepared by dispersing PtxSn100x parti-
cles onto Mg(Al)O. In a typical procedure, an appropriate volume
of the toluene suspension of PtxSn100x (70 6 x 6 100) particles dis-
persed in toluene (containing around 0.02 g metal) was added to a
suspension of 1.0 g Mg(Al)O in 5 mL anhydrous toluene. The mix-
ture was stirred overnight before the resulting product was precip-
itated by adding three times the volume anhydrous ethanol and
separated by centrifugation. The solid material was heated at
723 K for 1 h in air to remove the surface capping agents and then
reduced in an atmosphere of H2 in Ar (10 vol.%) at 873 K for 1 h.
A sample of Pt/Mg(Al)O was prepared by incipient wetness
impregnation. Pt(acac)2 (0.02 g or 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in
anhydrous toluene (1.5 mL) and added drop-wise onto the calcined
Mg(Al)O support (1.0 g) with continuous stirring. The solid was
dried under vacuum and then reduced in H2/Ar (10 vol.%) by rais-
ing the temperature to 723 K at 10 K/min and then maintaining it
at 723 K for 1 h.
2.4. Catalyst characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a
Siemens Diffractometer D 5000 equipped with a Cu Ka source
(wavelength
of
1.5418 Å).
Transmission
electron
microscopy
(TEM) images were taken using an FEI Tecnai 12 microscope with
an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM)
characterizations were conducted on the TEAM 0.5 high-resolution
microscope operated at 80 kV at the National Center for Electron
Microscopy (NCEM). Scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) images were taken on a FEI Titan S80-300 microscope
operated at 300 kV and under the high-angle annular dark ﬁeld
(HAADF) mode. The alloy compositions of as-synthesized particles
were measured by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) on a Hit-
achi S-4300SE/N scanning electron microscope (SEM). The Pt and
Sn contents of the catalysts were determined by inductively cou-
pled plasma-atomic absorption spectrometer (ICP-AAS) by Galbra-
ith Laboratories, Knoxville, TN.
2.5. Catalyst testing
Ethane dehydrogenation was carried out in a ﬁx-bed, quartz
reactor (7 mm internal diameter). In a standard procedure, the cat-
alyst materials were ﬁrst made into small pellets (250–500 lm in
diameter) by pressing, crushing, and sieving. Prior to testing, the
pelleted catalyst was heated at 723 K overnight in air to remove
possible moisture from the support. The catalyst was heated to
873 K at a rate of 15 K/min in 1 atm 20% H2 in He using a three-
zone furnace. The catalyst was maintained at this temperature
for 1 h to fully reduce the particles surface before exposing it to
reactants. A feed containing ethane, hydrogen, and helium was
used to determine the activity, selectivity, and stability of all Ptx-
Sn100x/Mg(Al)O (70 6 x 6 100) samples for ethane dehydrogena-
tion. The partial pressure of C2H6 and the H2/C2H6 ratio was ﬁxed
at 0.202 bar and 1.25, respectively, if not otherwise speciﬁed.
The reaction products were analyzed online by a gas chroma-
tography–mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Varian, Model 320). A ﬂame
ionization detector (FID) was used to quantify the concentrations
of all organic compounds eluting from the capillary column. Turn-
over frequency (TOF) was estimated from
TOF ¼ ðrC2H6  NAÞ=ðSSA  xPt  SPtÞ

where rC2H6 is the rate of ethane consumption (mol/[gmetal s]); NA is
Avogadro’s number; SSA is the speciﬁc surface area based on aver-
age size from TEM (cm2/g); xPt is the fraction of Pt relative to Sn

content; SPt is the surface density of Pt atoms (1.31  105 atoms/
cm2) calculated from hydrogen chemisorption on polycrystalline
platinum [32]. We assume a stoichiometry of one hydrogen atom
per surface platinum and a surface composition identical to Sn/Pt
of the bulk. While our previous study has shown by XPS that surface
enrichment of tin likely occurs in PtSn alloys [27], we will discuss
how our assumption may affect the results regarding effect of com-
position on TOF. The amount of accumulated coke was measured by
burning the coke to CO2 at 873 K in a mixture of 5% O2 in He ﬂowing
at 60 cm3/min. The CO2 signal was monitored as a function of time
using a mass spectrometer and the signal integrated to determine
the total amount of coke formed.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows TEM images and particle size distributions for Pt
and Pt–Sn nanoparticles prepared with average particle diameters
of 2.3–3.0 nm. Most of the particles were spherical in shape and fell
within a narrow size distribution around the mean diameter. Pow-
der X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the as-synthesized parti-
cles, as shown in Fig. 2, suggest they have a face centered cubic
(fcc) structure, with peaks assignable to (111), (200), (220),
(311), and (222) planes. The positions of diffraction peaks for pure
Pt metal (70-2057, JCPDS-ICDD) and Pt3Sn alloy (or Pt75Sn25, 65-
0958, JCPDS-ICDD) are included for reference. The diffraction peaks
of all Pt–Sn samples fall between those for pure Pt and Pt3Sn, sug-
gesting the formation of alloys [33]. The peaks shift toward Pt3Sn
with increasing Sn content. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)
spectra indicate that both Pt and Sn are present in the particles
and that the atomic percentage of Sn in the Pt–Sn alloy particles
determined by EDX agrees closely with that determined by ICP-
AAS (see Fig. 3).
Nanoparticles of Pt and Pt3Sn with particle sizes between 1.5
and 6.0 nm were prepared in order to explore the effects of particle
size on ethane dehydrogenation at constant particle composition.
Smaller amounts of OA and OAm, together with slower heating
rates and higher reaction temperatures, were used in combination
for making larger particles [34]. Fig. 4a and b shows that the 3.8 nm
and 6.0 nm Pt particles produced at 663 K appear to be more
faceted in shape than the 2.3 nm particles produced at 413 K (see
Fig. 1a). By contrast, the 3.5 nm and 6.8 nm Pt3Sn particles pre-
pared at 663 K do not exhibit signiﬁcant facets, and a small portion
of the particles appear to have dumbbell or even wormlike struc-
ture (Fig. 4c and d). Particles with such shapes may arise because
of the lower melting temperature for Pt–Sn alloys, which have
more mobile surfaces and tend to grow into each other when the
surfaces are protected by an insufﬁcient amount of capping agents
[35,36]. Figs. 5 and 6 show the PXRD patterns for the Pt and Pt3Sn
nanoparticles as a function of the average particle size. The match
between the positions of the reference peaks and those of the

nanoparticles is consistent with these particles being pure Pt and
Pt3Sn. The diffraction peaks became sharper as the average particle
size increased. It is also noted that the average particle size deter-
mined using the Scherrer equation is consistent with that deter-
mined by analysis of TEM images.
The effects of residence time on conversion for Pt/Mg(Al)O are
shown in Fig. 7. At higher residence times, or higher conversions
(15%), the extent of initial deactivation is severe. This agrees well
with previous studies of Pt catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation.
Therefore, the initial data point at 25.0  103 g s cm3 may already
represent a deactivated catalyst, masking the true initial activity.
Operating at a lower residence time (3.75  103 g s cm3), how-
ever, showed signiﬁcantly less deactivation and stable conversion
with time on stream.
Fig. 8 shows a representative STEM image of fresh Pt3Sn/Mg(A-
l)O prepared with an average particle size of 3.5 nm. Oxidation and
subsequent reduction in this and other samples of supported Pt
and Pt–Sn showed no evidence for a change in the average particle
size, nor was any change seen before and after use of these cata-
lysts for ethane dehydrogenation at 873 K (compare Fig. 8a and
b). Therefore, it was concluded that the deactivation shown in
Fig. 7 originates from coke formation, rather than sintering of the

determined by EDX and ICP-AAS, to that of the metal precursors.

catalyst. The extent of deactivation between 0.3 min and 10.3 min
as a function of particle size for Pt and Pt3Sn catalysts is shown in
Fig. 9. It is clear that both composition and size play an important
role in coke formation, consistent with previous studies [8–10,37].
With decreasing particle size and Sn addition, deactivation de-
creased signiﬁcantly, an effect more pronounced at high residence
time conditions. Fig. 10 shows direct measurement of the accumu-
lation of coke, measured as the moles of C per mole of surface Pt, as
a function of particle size at high residence time condition. Coke
formation increases as particle size increases for both Pt and Pt–
Sn, a trend that is in full agreement with ﬁndings of our recent
high-resolution TEM study [37]. Particles less than about 2 nm in
diameter demonstrate minimal coke accumulation after 2 h and a
signiﬁcant part of the coke accumulated on particles of this size
migrate onto the support. For particles larger than about 6 nm in
diameter, coke deposition leads to complete envelopment of the
Pt particles by multiple graphene layers. The size dependency of
carbon growth is attributed to the accommodation of strain energy
generated in the graphene layers and the minimization of overall
free energy in the carbon growth process [37,38]. To address effect
of composition, Fig. 11 shows the effect of Sn/Pt on C/Pt at high
residence time condition. The value of C/Pt measure after 2 h of
reaction decreased very sharply with increasing Sn content. The
strong decrease in coke formation upon the addition of Sn to Pt
is fully consistent with results reported previously [6,8,10,11]
and explains the lower deactivation on Pt3Sn shown in Fig. 9.
TEM studies have also shown that Sn addition strongly reduces
the accumulation of graphene layers even on larger Pt–Sn bimetal-
lic particles. We have previously proposed that the addition of Sn
presents additional strain energy for the growth of graphene on
Pt and in fact, may be blocking the steps for carbon nucleation [37].
Reactions were carried out at a high feed space velocity in order
to minimize the gas-phase concentration of ethene. Under these
conditions, the effects of coking due to ethene re-adsorption are
minimized, and comparison of the effects of particle size and com-
position on the intrinsic rate of ethane dehydrogenation is greatly
facilitated [6]. In all cases, 5 mg of catalyst was used and the reac-
tion temperature was maintained at 873 K. Ethane was fed at a
partial pressure of 0.202 bar together with hydrogen and helium.
The total ﬂow rate was kept at 80 cm3/min and the total pressure
was maintained at 1 atm. Hydrogen was added to the feed in order
to decrease coke formation [6]. Fig. 12 shows the effect of H2/C2H6
feed ratio on C2H6 conversion for 3.8 nm Pt/Mg(Al)Oand 3.5 nm
Pt3Sn/Mg(Al)O. Co-feeding hydrogen increased catalyst activity
for dehydrogenation. However, as the H2/C2H6 ratio was increased
to 2.5, the conversion of ethane decreased due a downward shift in
the equilibrium conversion. A H2/C2H6 ratio of 1.25 was selected
for the remaining experiments.

Figs. 13 and 14 show the effects of Sn content on ethane TOF
and ethene selectivity for nanoparticles of nearly constant size
(2.5 nm) measured after 0.3 min from the onset of reaction. The
TOF of ethane increased by about 40% and the selectivity to ethene
increased from 85% to 95% as the fraction of Sn in the Pt–Sn nano-
particles increased from 0 to 0.42. As previously described, TOF
values were calculated based on the assumption that the surface
composition is identical to that of the bulk. We note, however, that
our previous studies of unsupported PtSn nanoparticles prepared
in the same manner as that used for the present study do show evi-
dence for surface enrichment in Sn. This means that the TOF values
for ethane consumption reported for PtSn/Mg(Al)O in Fig. 13 repre-
sent a lower bound.
The effects of Sn promotion on the activity and selectivity of
PtSn alloys are fully consistent with previous reports. It has been
proposed that the addition of Sn to Pt affects the dehydrogenation
of ethane as a consequence of both geometric and electronic effects
[12–18]. Deposition of Sn on the surface of Pt particles reduces the
size of Pt ensembles and thus the ability of Pt to cleave carbon–
carbon bonds, a process leading to the formation of methane and
coke [39–41]. In addition, the transfer of electronic charge from
Sn to Pt reduces the heat of ethene adsorption, a critical step in
coke formation [13,15,18]. Quantum chemical studies also suggest
that the dissociative adsorption of ethane on surface Pt is enhanced
by the presence of Sn [12,13,19], thereby promoting the rate-lim-
iting step in ethane dehydrogenation. Our results show the same
trend with Sn promotion but also suggest that even under condi-
tions with little deactivation, Pt–Sn catalysts are intrinsically more
active than Pt. We note, however, that even for low residence time
conditions, there still exists a small amount of deactivation. There-
fore, the addition of Sn suppresses coke formation, but does not
eliminate it completely. We also note that since the extent of deac-
tivation shown at low residence time conditions is signiﬁcantly
lower than what has been reported in the past [6,8–10], we are
able to measure reaction rates that are much closer to the intrinsic
activity of each catalyst. Minimization of the effects of deactiva-
tion, particularly on Pt/Mg(Al)O, also helps to deﬁne more clearly
the true rate enhancement achieved by alloying with Sn.
The effects of particle size on ethane TOF and ethene selectivity
for Pt/Mg(Al)O and Pt3Sn/Mg(Al)O are illustrated in Figs. 15 and 16.
A sample of Pt/Mg(Al)O with average particle size of 8.5 nm was
prepared to give an additional data point. Here, we report what
we believe is the ﬁrst study of Pt and Pt3Sn particle size depen-
dence on ethane dehydrogenation. While selectivity to ethene re-
mained nearly constant across all particle sizes for both Pt and
Pt3Sn, ethane TOF increased with increasing particle size. This sug-
gests that ethane dehydrogenation favors ﬂatter surfaces on large
particles, which have a higher proportion of terrace sites versus
corners and step sites. Low coordination Pt sites typically are more
active for catalyzing C–C bond breaking [26]. Furthermore, binding
energy calculations on Pt surfaces show that step edge atoms bind
to ethene much stronger than terrace atoms [42]. The calculated
binding energy difference between Pt(111) and Pt(211) for di-r
bonded ethene is 71 kJ/mol, a signiﬁcantly stronger interaction
with lower-coordinated atoms. Therefore, larger particles may ex-
hibit higher TOF for ethane dehydrogenation due to the ease with
which nascent ethene is removed from the surface to the gas
phase. The trend with particle size is identical for Pt and Pt3Sn cat-
alysts. While there is a 300% increase in ethane TOF from 1.5 nm to
8.5 nm for Pt/Mg(Al)O, the loss in speciﬁc surface area going to
from 1.5 nm to 8 nm is about 500%. Therefore, while larger particle

show higher TOF for dehydrogenation, it is still more favorable to
use smaller particles for increased surface area. In addition, operat-
ing at high residence time to achieve industrially relevant conver-
sions results in higher coke formation on larger particles.
4. Conclusions
The effects of composition and size of Pt–Sn particles on coke
formation, rate of ethane dehydrogenation, and the selectivity to
ethene were studied using PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70 6 x 6 100)
nanoparticles dispersed onto Mg(Al)O. C/Pt decreased signiﬁcantly
with decreasing particle size and increasing Sn addition, trends
consistent with our previous TEM study and explanations. A un-
ique strategy was employed to make accurate comparisons of true
initial activity. Operating at low residence time resulted in signiﬁ-
cantly lowered deactivation, attributable to lower coke formation
from ethene, and allowed for measurement closer to the true initial
activity. For a ﬁxed average particle size, the TOF and selectivity of
these catalysts for ethene production increased with the content of
Sn. These trends are attributed to a combination of geometric and
electronic effects brought about by the presence of Sn on the
surface of Pt nanoparticles TOF was also found to increase with
increasing particle size, a trend attributed to differences in the
fraction of lower-coordinated surface atoms and in the electronic
properties of the particles. While ethane dehydrogenation may
favor ﬂatter surfaces, the gain in TOF is not signiﬁcant enough to
lose surface area by going to larger particles. Additionally, practical
implementation of this system at high conversions suggests that
small and Sn-promoted catalysts should be used to avoid coke
formation.
