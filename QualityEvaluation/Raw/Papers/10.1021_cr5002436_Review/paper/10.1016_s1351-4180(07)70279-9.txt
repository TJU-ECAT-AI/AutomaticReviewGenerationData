Jubail, Saudi Arabia, for commissioning
in 2008. The facility will yield 80,000
tonne/y of normal-butanol using LP
Oxo Selector 80 technology with a
Normax catalyst from Davy Process
Technology. It will be built at a petro-
chemical complex that is envisaged to
produce 200,000 tonnes of acrylic acid
and its derivatives. Arkema and Essar
Chemicals will study the viability of
building an equal jv facility for acrylic
acid and esters production. Startup of
the Vadinar, Gujarat, India facility is
expected in 2010.

New F-T plant for China
A team of researchers from the Centre
of Material and Process Synthesis
(COMPS) at the University of
Witwatersand, South Africa, will head
the construction of a new generation
Fischer-Tropsch plant in Shaanxi,
China, by Apr 2007. The R75 M ($10.4
M) pilot plant will turn carbon monoxide
and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbons.
The Chinese company Golden Nest
Technology Group is financing the
plant, which is expected to be about
30% more efficient compared to
conventional technology. Gas will be
supplied by a nearby ammonia facility
and coal will be obtained from local
reserves. After six months, the pilot
plant can be upgraded into a
commercial-scale facility.

UOP commissions 200th CCR
platforming process unit
UOP LLC, the Honeywell subsidiary,
commissioned its 200th unit using the
CCR Platforming process on 5 Mar
2007 at the refinery operated by
Sinopec Hainan Petrochemical Co in
Hainan province, China. The unit will
use advanced CCR Reforming
catalysts to enable high liquid and
hydrogen yields, low coke production,
and optimum profitability in the
production of clean fuels and
chemical feedstock. CCR Platforming
features energy-efficient continuous
catalytic reforming of naphthenes and
paraffins to produce aromatics and
hydrogen. Since 1985, the process
has been used in over 27 units in
China with a throughput of over 26 M
tonne/y. Other technology licensed by
UOP to Sinopec since the early 1980s
includes 12 aromatics complexes, two
linear alkylbenzene units, and other
refining technology.

BASF will construct new plant in
Moscow region
BASF (Germany) is planning to build
a plant in Russia for the production of
catalytic neutralization tanks
(presumably automobile exhaust
catalysts – Ed.) for motorcars. To be
based in the Krasnogorsk district of
Moscow, it will have an expected
capacity of 2 M catalysts/y according
to the Engelhard licence. Production
is due to begin in 2008. Investment in
the project is evaluated at $20-30 M.
By 2011 the car market in Russia
should reach 4 M items. Platinum and
palladium needed for catalyst
manufacturing are produced only in
Russia and South Africa.

construction of a 918 bbl/day naphtha
treatment unit, a 850 bbl/day
speciality solvents unit, a 425 bbl/day
hydrotreatment plant, a 2020 bbl/day
catalytic converter unit, a 4000

and a gas combustion and
compression unit. Project completion
is expected in 2H 2007.

Degussa to build alkoxides plant in
Mobile
Degussa intends to expand its
complex in Mobile, AL, by setting up a
‘low double-digit million Euro’ facility
for making 60,000 tonne/y of
alkoxides. Alkoxides serve as
catalysts in biodiesel manufacture.
The company expects to commission
the new unit in 2H 2008. It will be
used to cater to requirements of
clients in the NAFTA region.

New catalyst promises lower-cost
biodiesel
Ube Material Industries, in
collaboration with Yamaguchi
University, has created a highly active
solid base catalyst capable of
speeding up biodiesel production
while increasing productivity. The use
of the calcium-based material
facilitates biodiesel separation and
eliminates the need to purify the
manufactured biodiesel. Ube will
continue with R&D for the catalyst’s
early commercialization.

Magnetic process for removing spent
FCC catalyst
The magnetic properties of active and
spent FCC catalysts, due to their
nickel contents, are different. Nippon
