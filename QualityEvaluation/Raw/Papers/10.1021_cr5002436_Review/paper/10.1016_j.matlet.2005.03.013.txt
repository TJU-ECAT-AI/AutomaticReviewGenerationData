Abstract
In this work, the modifying effect of alkaline metals (Li, Na and K) is studied on the acid properties of the support and on the behavior of
PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalytic systems, in the isobutane dehydrogenation. The isopropyl alcohol transformation rate decreases sharply with the
addition of alkaline metals, according to the sequence Li<Na<K. For the dehydrogenation reaction, the addition of K improves the stability
level of the catalyst, and, as a result, PtSnK1.7 catalyst presents the best performance activity/selectivity/stability.

1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins, due to
the endothermic character of these reactions, presents
thermodynamic difficulties and for this reason it has to be
carried out at high temperatures (above 773 K for the
isobutane case). This fact, apart from representing a high
energetic cost, favors the appearance of undesirable lateral
reactions such as formation of coke and light hydrocarbons
by cracking. Taking dehydrogenation reaction of isobutane
as an example, the skeletal isomerization is also an
important cause of selectivity decrease to isobutene. This
reaction is strongly favored by acid sites present in the g-
alumina usually used as support. The neutralization of these
sites by adding alkaline metals is a way to decrease the
formation of lineal hydrocarbons from isobutane or from
isobutene [1–3]. Previous studies performed by our group
demonstrated that the methodology of alkaline modifier
incorporation has an important influence on the catalyst
final properties [4,5].
Tin is the most widely used modifier of platinum in
catalysts for direct alkane dehydrogenation, leading to a
system with higher selectivity to olefins and higher stability
[2,3,6–10]. The most important tin effects on these catalysts
are: (i) the strong inhibition of cracking due to a geometrical
effect, and (ii) the decrease of the deactivation rate, either by a
decrease of the coke formation rate or by a modification of the
nature of the coke formed. The accurate nature of supported
PtSn systems is very complicated, and numerous factors
affect the characteristics of these catalysts, such as the support
acidity, preparation procedure, nature of the precursor
compounds, etc. Preparation techniques play a significant
role in controlling the type of interactions that occur between
tin and platinum and between them and the support. Surface
Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) procedures
applied to the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts lead to stable
and highly dispersed systems, as it has been reported in the
literature [2]. These techniques involve the reaction of
organotin compounds, such as tetra-n-butyltin (SnBu4), with
a transition metal supported on SiO2 or Al2O3 [11–13].

In this work, the modifying effect of alkaline metals (Li,
Na and K) was studied on the acid properties of the support
and on the behavior of catalytic systems PtSn/;-Al2O3, in
the isobutane dehydrogenation. The analysis of the influ-
ence of the alkaline metal addition on the solid acidity was
carried out by means of the isopropyl alcohol trans-
formation. In this case, the study was performed on the
modified g-Al2O3 (Li,Na,K)/g-Al2O3) and not on modified
bimetallic systems (PtSn(Li,Na,K)/g-Al2O3), due to the fact
that the isopropyl alcohol is dehydrogenated in presence of
Pt, which masks the results referred specifically to acid–
base properties of the support.
2. Experimental
A high purity commercial g-Al2O3 with a BET surface
area of 184.1 m2/g has been used. Before impregnation,
alumina was calcined for 2 h at 773 K in air. Two series of
alkali/alumina samples were prepared by impregnating
alumina (60–100 mesh) with aqueous solution of the alkali
metal precursors (LiOH, NaOH, KOH, Merck, p.a.). After
impregnation, samples were dried at 378 K overnight and
calcined in air at 773 K. The alkali metal concentrations of
the different samples are shown in Table 1.
Bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by
employing SOMC/M techniques [2,14]. To prepare the base
monometallic catalyst, a solution of H2PtCl6, having a
concentration to obtain 1% w/w Pt exchanged, was added
onto the g-Al2O3, according to the procedures described in
references. The reduced monometallic catalyst was made to
react with tetra-n-butyltin (SnBu4) in n-decane solution
under an H2 atmosphere. The reaction temperature was 423
K; after approximately 6 h, the solid was filtered out,
washed with several portions of n-heptane, and dried. The
bimetallic phase PtSn/g-Al2O3 was obtained by eliminating
all the organic moieties with a reduction treatment under H2
flow at 773 K. For the experiments presented in this work,
an Sn/Pt atomic ratio of 1.6 was selected.
In order to prepare alkali-modified systems (PtSnMx.x;
M: Li, Na, K; x.x: concentration wt.% of the alkaline metal),
an aqueous solution of the alkaline promoter was introduced
on the reduced PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalyst. The concentrations of
the alkaline ions were the same as those employed to modify
the support.
The surface and porous characteristics of the investigated
samples were obtained by N2 adsorption (77.4 K) in a
conventional volumetric apparatus (Micromeritics ASAP
2000). Micrographs were obtained by using a Philips 505
Scanning Electron Microscope.
All the samples were tested in the isopropyl alcohol
dehydration reaction, at atmospheric pressure in a flow
reactor. The alcohol was fed into the reactor in an N2 stream
(30 cm3/min). The reaction temperature ranged between 373
and 676 K. Reaction products were analyzed through GC,
by using a 1.2 m column packed with Carbowax 20M and a
flame ionization detector. A sample weight of 100 mg was
used in all the experiments.
Catalytic activity for isobutane dehydrogenation was
measured in a conventional flow reactor at atmospheric
pressure, 823 K, total feed flow of 50 cm3/min, and an H2/
iso-C4H10 ratio of 3. The composition of the feed flow and
of the reaction products was analyzed through gas chroma-
tography, by using a Carlo Erba Fractovap series 2150 gas
chromatograph on line with the reactor. A 1/4 in. o.d.
stainless steel column, 6 m in length, packed with tricresyl
phosphate on Chromosorb W, operated at 353 K was
employed for this work.
3. Results and discussion
As it was previously mentioned, competitive reactions of
isomerization are favored by the presence of acid sites of the
g-Al2O3 used as support. In order to inhibit or decrease the
strength of these sites, in a first stage, the addition effect of
alkaline ions on the total acidity of the support was
analyzed. Table 1 presents the composition of the prepared
materials and their nomenclature; Li, Na and K concen-
trations were selected in order to be able to compare results
at similar atomic concentrations.
Modified supports were analyzed from the point of view
of their textural properties, taking into account that alkaline
metals could act as fusing agents. It is clear that changes
induced in these properties can have important influence on
the final properties of the catalysts prepared with these
supports. Table 1 presents values of BET (Sg) surface for
different analyzed supports. From the analysis of this table,
it appears that neither Na nor K significantly modifies the
original Sg of g-Al2O3, while Li modifies it by passing from

184.1 to 164.1 m2/g when the ;-Al2O3 is compared with
ALi0.3. Differences of textural properties observed in the
Li-modified support are correlated with morphological
characteristics that arise from the observation of SEM
microphotographs of these materials. Fig. 1a–d show these
microphotographs for the unmodified support and for the
modified supports with the highest alkaline concentrations.
It is evident that the morphology is similar for g-Al2O3
and g-Al2O3 modified by Na or K, while g-Al2O3
modified by Li morphology suffers important changes in
its texture, noticing ‘‘patches’’ that originate blocking of
pores and decrease of the BET surface. These ‘‘patches’’
are formed during the calcination stage carried out at 773
K. This behavior may be explained by the melting point of
alkaline hydroxides which are 633, 591 and 743 K for
KOH, NaOH and LiOH, respectively. The melting temper-
atures of NaOH and of KOH are quite below the
temperature of calcination and that is why it is possible
to assume that they melt completely, so they can be
distributed uniformly on the alumina. In the LiOH case, a
probable incomplete melting effect during the calcination
stage may be the cause of a non-homogeneous redistrib-
ution resulting in these ‘‘patches’’.
The study about the influence of the deposit of alkaline
metals on the g-Al2O3 acidity was carried out by means
of the isopropyl alcohol transformation. The ‘‘test’’
reaction of the isopropyl alcohol (IPA) decomposition is
an indirect determination for the characterization of acid
and basic sites present on a solid surface, different from
the case of adsorption–desorption of bases (comple-
mented with IR spectroscopy) [15,16]. The decomposition
of this alcohol involves dehydration and dehydrogenation
reactions that occur by means of three mechanisms
denominated E1, E1CB and E2. The E1 mechanism
involves strong Bro
¨nsted or Lewis acid sites to give
propene as reaction product On the other hand, the E1CB
mechanism requires basic and weak Lewis acid sites,
which act in a concerted mechanism producing also
propene. Finally, the E2 dehydration mechanism involves
pairs of acid–base sites of similar strength. Di-isopropyl
ether is also produced by this mechanism, by condensa-
tion followed by dehydration. The isopropyl alcohol
dehydrogenation to ketone is produced through an E1CB
mechanism. From these considerations, the obtention of
propene as main product (or propene plus di-isopropyl
ether) suggests a support with predominant acid nature,

while the ketone presence clearly indicates the existence
of basic sites.
Fig. 2 presents conversion curves as a function of the
reaction temperature for the IPA transformation on the
different studied supports. The IPA transformation rate
sharply decreases with the addition of alkaline metals; at
higher concentration of alkaline metal, the penalizing effect
is higher. When the three alkaline metals are compared at
equivalent atomic concentrations, the inhibiting sequence
follows the order Li<Na<K.
Considering a first order reaction rate expression,
apparent activation energies and pre-exponential factors
were calculated and are shown in Table 2.
In the unmodified support as well as in modified
supports, for the lower concentration level in Li, Na or K
(Series 1), the propene is the main product, detecting also
di-isopropyl ether (it decreases as the temperature increases)
and ketone (it increases with temperature). For these
systems, the generation of basic sites is still incipient and
for this reason the ketone contribution to the final products
is not significant.
When the concentration of alkaline metals increases
(Series 2), larger ketone amounts appear indicating an
increase in the basicity and a decrease in the acidity of g-
Al2O3; the appearance of basic sites together with weak acid
sites would be responsible for the dehydrogenation to
ketone (E1CB mechanism). Results obtained are conclusive
with respect to an important inhibition of the activity of acid
sites of the support following the sequence K>Na>Li, as it
appears from the values of the pre-exponential factor. Ionic
radii of K, Na and Li are 0.133, 0.097 and 0.068 nm,
respectively; at larger ionic radius, there is larger blocking
of the support acid sites. Table 3 shows the selectivities to
the different products for g-Al2O3 and Series 2 modified
supports at 3 levels of temperature.
Values of activation energy between 150 and 160 kJ/mol
were obtained for all systems suggesting that no changes are
observed in the mechanism of the isopropyl alcohol trans-
formation. Values of the same order for the IPA trans-
formation are reported by Trikalitis and Pomonis in the case
of perovskites catalysts [17].
The behavior of PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalytic systems,
unmodified and modified by the K, Na and Li addition,
was studied in the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction at
atmospheric pressure, 823 K and a feed composition of H2/
isobutane=3/1.
Fig. 3 shows isobutane conversion values (initial and
after 4 h of reaction), for all analyzed systems. Taking the

Pt/g-Al2O3 catalyst as basis for comparison, it is possible
to observe that this system presents the highest initial
activity, but it decreases markedly after 4 h on stream.
When tin is added, the initial conversion for all systems is
slightly lower but in contraposition, its value is maintained
without important variations in the course of time,
especially in the systems modified by adding alkaline
metals.
Also in Fig. 3, initial values and values after 4 h of
reaction are represented, for selectivities to cracking,
isomerization and dehydrogenation. The selectivity to
isobutene after 4 h on stream was noticeably improved by
adding Sn, raising from 57% for Pt/g-Al2O3 to 76% for
PtSn/g-Al2O3, due to the decrease of cracking and isomer-
ization reactions. This is a well known fact studied in the
literature and explained by a combination of geometric and
electronic effects [2,3,7]. However, the contribution of
isomerization reactions in the PtSn/g-Al2O3 system is still
important.
The fact that the selectivity to isomerization products for
this catalyst is almost unaffected in relation to Pt/g-Al2O3
system indicates that, due to the specificity of SOMC/M
techniques, tin might not be modifying the support acidity.
As it is shown in Fig. 3, the presence of alkaline metals as
modifiers produces a marked decrease of isomerization
reactions, being the effectiveness order is K>Na>Li, in
agreement with results obtained for support acidity studies.
Thus, the K addition to PtSn/;-Al2O3 catalyst results in a
catalyst able to produce isobutane dehydrogenation with a
selectivity to isobutene >98%.
Results arising from this study show that the presence of
alkaline metals affects basically isomerization reactions,
carried out principally on acid sites of the support and in a
lesser proportion to the reactions catalyzed by the metallic
phase. This indicates that conclusions obtained from the
study of the isopropyl alcohol transformation on g-Al2O3
modified in relation to its acid–basic properties can be
extrapolated to the modified bimetallic systems.
Regarding stability, it was demonstrated in previous
works that the principal deactivation mechanism is produced
by the coke deposition. This coke is deposited on the
metallic phase and also on the support through a migration
process. In order to quantify the stability, an activity
coefficient a was defined (ratio between the catalyst activity
at reaction time t and the initial activity). Fig. 4 shows
results corresponding to Pt/g-Al2O3, PtSn/g-Al2O3 and
PtSnK1.7 catalysts, noticing that in presence of Sn a marked
stability increase is produced.
As a conclusion, the addition of potassium improves
even more this stability level of the catalyst and as a
result, PtSnK1.7 catalyst presents the best performance
activity/selectivity/stability in the isobutane dehydrogen-
ation reaction.
4. Conclusions
( The addition of Na and K on g-Al2O3 support does not
modify its textural properties, while Li modifies the Sg
value, due to a probable incomplete melting effect during
the calcination stage generating ‘‘patches’’ on the support
surface.
( The isopropyl alcohol transformation rate sharply
decreases when adding alkaline metals, according to
the sequence Li<Na<K. These results are conclusive
with respect to an important inhibition of the activity of
the support acid sites: at larger ionic radius, there is a
larger blocking effect.
( For the dehydrogenation reaction, the addition of K
improves the stability level of the catalyst, and as a result,
PtSnK1.7 catalyst presents the best performance activity/
selectivity/stability.
