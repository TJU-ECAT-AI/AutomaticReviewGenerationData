Abstract
In the present paper, the catalytic dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 under non-oxidative conditions was investigated in a fixed-bed micro-reactor under ambient pressure at 823 - 923 K. The 6Cr/g-Al2O3 catalyst was found to be the best catalyst among the g-Al2O3, SiO2, MCM41, MgO and Si-2 supported chromium oxide catalysts. The features of the 6Cr/g-Al2O3 catalyst for the reaction could be listed as follows: (1) At 823 - 923 K, the C2H4 selectivity of 92.5-78.6% at a C2H6 conversion of 9.5-29.8% could be obtained. (2) The catalyst had the good regeneration performance, i.e., could be regenerated by air repeatedly. (3) The main products were C2H4, CH4, H2 and coke. No carbon oxides were identified.
