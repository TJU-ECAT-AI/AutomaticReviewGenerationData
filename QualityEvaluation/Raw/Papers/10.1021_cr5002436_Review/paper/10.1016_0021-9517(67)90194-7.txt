The dehydrogenation reaction of n-butane over chromia-alumina has been 
kinetically 
investigated employing the differential reactor technique at temperatures 
ranging from 
510” to 550°C. The runs were performed on n-butane and on mixtures of n-butane + 
1-butene 
or n-butane + hydrogen, in the presence 
of an inert gas (nitrogen), with com- 
plete analysis of reaction products. The reaction rate data fit satisfactorily the dual-site 
mechanism. 
A set of runs have been 
made 
on 10% chromia catalyst, containing different amounts 
of Liz0 or NazO. 
The progressive 
addition of Liz0 gave 
a continuous deactivation of the 
catalyst, while the progressive 
addition of NazO gave a deactivation followed by an 
activation. An interpretation of the reaction mechanism 
on the basis of electronic 
theory 
of catalysis 
is offered.

reducing it at 550°C for 1 hr with a small 
flow of dry hydrogen. 
After reduction 
the 
catalyst 
was cooled until 
its temperature 
was about 220°C with a small flow of dry 
nitrogen. 
In Table 1 are listed the properties of the 
catalysts prepared and employed in experi- 
ment,al runs. 
Equipment 
The dehydrogenation 
runs were performed 
in 
a stainless 
steel 
(type 
446) reactor, 
2 cm in diameter, 50 cm in length, in which 
the catalyst was contained in a small basket, 
made of the same material, 
the bottom of 
which 
was formed 
of metal 
mesh. This 
reactor was heated by electrical resistances, 
placed in tubular 
refractory 
heaters sur- 
rounding the reactor. The temperature 
was

means of a double pipe heat exchanger and, 
by a suitable system of valves, it could be 
sent to a soap-bubble flow meter or to a 
sample collector. Temperatures 
of metered 
gases were taken by mercury thermometers 
inserted in the gas pipes. 
Procedure 
All runs were conducted with fresh cata- 
lyst as follows: After the weighed quantity 
of catalyst 
had been introduced 
into the 
catalyst basket, the reactor was stopped and 
flushed with a small nitrogen flow (50 ml/ 
min) 
to 
eliminate 
oxygen. 
During 
this 
flushing, the reactor temperature was raised 
up to 100°C below the chosen reaction 
temperature and at this point we started the 
feeding of the gas mixtures 
at the desired

are collected in Table 3. Four runs at, each 
temperature were made feeding a mixture of 
n-butane, 1-butene, and nitrogen at various 
ratios 
of 1-butene 
to n-butane 
and 
at 
constant partial pressure of n-butane (0.181

a mixture 
of n-butane, 
hydrogen, 
and 
nitrogen 
at various 
ratios of hydrogen 
to 
n-butane and at constant partial pressure of 
n-butane (0.181 atm). 
With a second series of runs we tested the 
influence 
of the presence of various 
con- 
centrations of Liz0 or NazO in the basic 10% 
chromia-on-alumina 
catalyst. 
These runs 
were performed at the temperatures of 550”, 
540”, 530”, 520”, and 510°C and at the same 
n-butane 
partial 
pressure of 0.181 atm; 
values of reaction rates vs. NazO or Liz0 
percentages are plotted in Fig. 2. 
A third 
series of runs 
concerned 
the 
investigation 
of the influence 
on reaction 
rate of the chromia percentage on alumina, 
from 0% to 20%, without 
alkaline oxides. 
These data were collected at 550”, 530”, and 
510°C and at the same n-butane 
partial 
pressure of 0.181 atm and are plotted 
in 
Fig. 3. 
REACTION 
KINETICS 
The influence of mass transfer on reaction 
kinetics 
has been tested by analyzing 
the 
values of the ratio APB/P~, where APs is the 
difference 
between 
the 
n-butane 
partial 
pressure in the gas stream (PB) and at the 
surface of the catalyst particles, taken to be 
spherical, for some suitably 
chosen kinetic 
runs. Such a ratio is given by 
APBIPB = (r/dd% 
(1) 
where r is the reaction rate per unit mass of 
catalyst 
pellet, 
unz the 
external 
area of 
pellets per unit 
mass of catalyst, 
kOn the 
mass transfer 
coefficient 
of n-butane, 
cal- 
culated by means of the well known J-factor 
correlation 
(4). The diffusion 
coefficient 
of 
n-butane in nitrogen and the viscosity of the 
gas mixture 
have been evaluated applying 
the standard 
procedure 
(5). For the runs 
performed with Type 0 catalyst, the result- 
ing values of APB/PB were less than 0.01. 
Therefore the values of the partial pressure 
drops from gas stream to catalyst surface are 
quite 
small 
and 
the 
effect 
of external 
diffusion can be neglected.

of 55O”C, has been

made in order t’o evaluate 
the effect of

inside the catalyst 
particles on reaction kinetics. A mean value 
of the pore radius rP of our catalyst particles, 
evaluated 
from pore vol;me 
and surface 
area data, was about 33 A; the mean free 
path of n-butane at the reaction pressure is 
about 3.4 X low5 cm, that is, much greater 
than rP. Therefore it is justified 
t,o assume 
that the internal 
diffusion 
is substantially 
Knudsen-type; 
the resulting

sion coefficient, calculated with t,he known 
formula (5), is

pP being the catalyst 
density 
and Cn the

of n-butane, 
were 
obtained : 
6 = 0.0322 (at, 0.303 atm) 
4 = 0.0821 (at 0.111 atm) 
Such<values are sufficiently 
small to guar- 
antee an almost unitary 
value of effective- 
ness, despite the form of the rate equation. 
A general scheme of n-butane 
dehydro- 
genation can be written as follows: 
distribution 
of butenes is largely dominated 
by the equilibrium 
conditions and therefore 
it is difficult 
to establish if one of the butenes 
is preferentially 
formed from n-butane. On 
the other hand, from the data of Table 4 it 
appears that the experimental 
ratios (C/E) 
and (T/E) 
are generally 
smaller than the 
equilibrium 
ones. This fact seems to indicate 
that 
2-butenes 
have 
a slightly 
higher 
dehydrogenation 
rate than 1-butene.

The kinetic mechanism for the n-butane 
dehydrogenation 
reaction 
was selected by 
analysis 
of the influence 
of the reactant 
partial pressure on reaction rate. The trend 
of the experimental data of Table 3, graphi- 
cally reported in Fig. 4, suggests that the 
rate-determining 
step is the surface reaction, 
which involves two adjacent active centers 
(dual-site). The rate equation corresponding 
to this mechanism is

the

the

it was possible to obtain

Employing 
the 
values 
of 
adsorption 
equilibrium 
constants collected in Table 5, 
it is now possible to check how good is the 
approximation 
by which the Eqs. (5) and (7) 
have been obtained 
from 
Eq. 
(4). The 
adsorption equilibrium 
constant of butadiene 
has been evaluated on the basis of the value 
9.5 obtained 
by 
Balandin 
(10) in 
the 
dehydrogenation 
of I-butene 
for the ratio 
(br/bA). 
This assumption is justified 
by the 
fact that our ratio (bH/bA) is also quite close 
to the value reported in the same papers. 
Taking 
into 
account 
all 
the adsorption 
equilibrium 
constants it is derived that the 
correction 
of the 
reaction 
rate 
in 
the 
investigated 
n-butane partial pressure range 
is about 59/. The neglect of such a correction 
does not affect any conclusion. 
As the reactions which were performed 
with doped catalysts, one can assume that 
the 
chemisorption 
constant 
be 
is only 
slightly 
affected by the addition 
of im- 
purities. 
If the fact that all the reaction 
rates reported in Fig. 2 were measured at the 
same value 
Pe is taken into account, 
it 
follows that 
ln(r/rc) 
= -AEJRT 
(11) 
In Eq. (11) r and TO 
are the reaction rates 
on doped and Type 0 catalysts, respectively; 
AE, is the increase of activation 
energy on 
doped catalyst with respect to the Type 0 
catalyst. Good straight lines of In r vs. (l/Y)

REACTION 
MECHANIS~I 
The 
experimental 
reaction 
rat,e data 
confirm 
the 
validity 
of the 
Langmuir- 
Hinshelwood 
scheme for the description 
of 
the n-butane dehydrogenation 
reaction. The 
kinetic 
mechanism of the reaction reveals 
that t,he rate-determining 
step is the surface 
reaction with a dual-site mechanism. This 
result 
confirms 
the previous 
findings 
of 
Dodd and Watson (1). 
On the other hand it is noteworthy 
that 
in the dehydrogenation 
of cyclohexane 
on 
the same catalysts 
the 
rate-determining 
step is the hydrocarbon 
chemisorption 
as it 
is substantiated 
by the absence of cyclo- 
hexene and cyclohexadiene 
in the reaction 
products (11). The much larger rate of the 
surface reaction of cyclohexane with respect 
to n-butane could be due to participation 
of 
an hexagonal array of surface chromium ions 
on chromia 
(12) as it is claimed in the 
hydrogenation 
of aromatic hydrocarbons. 
The n-butane 
chemisorption 
centers on 
the 
catalyst 
are localized 
on Cr2+ ions 
(11, 1s). The chemisorption 
process occurs 
through 
a cleavage of a C-H 
bond; the 
alkyl group is bound to a Crz+ ion on the 
catalyst surface and the H atom to one of 
the neighboring 
oxygen atoms. The bond 
between the alkyl group and the metal can 
be described 
as a strong acceptor bond, 
because a free electron is captured by the 
radical (14). In the language of the crystal 
field 
theory 
of chemisorption 
(15) this 
corresponds to the fulfillment 
of coordination 
of Cr(III) 
with 
formation 
of a surface 
octaedral complex. 
The further 
step of the dehydrogenation 
reaction, 
according 
to the experimentally 
found dual-site mechanism, seems to be due 
to t’he intervention 
of another Cr”+ ion, that 
abstract.s 
an hydrogen 
atom 
from 
the 
adsorbed alkyl radical. The experimentally 
found strong competition 
in chemisorption 
of hydrogen and n-butane can support this 
interpretation. 
The desorption of hydrogen 
and of the oIefin moIecules constitutes 
the 
last step of the reaction. 
The formation 
of divalent chromium ions 
on the catalyst 
can be due to a catalyst 
partial reduction. Measurements ot electrical 
conductivity 
of chromia-alumina 
catalysts 
as a function 
of temperature 
(16, 17), 
showed that the catalyst is a semiconductor 
with 
amphoteric 
nature 
(n- 
or 
p-type 
depending on the physical conditions) 
and 
therefore both free electrons and holes are 
present on its surface. 
In a semiconductor 
lattice 
the electron 
shifting 
is easy and it follows 
that 
the 
previous mechanism can be interpreted 
in 
the light of the electronic theory of catalysis 
(14, 18, 19). 
The 
proposed 
reaction 
mechanism 
is 
shown in Fig. 10, where 8 and @ indicate 
the electrons and the holes on the catalyst 
surface, respectively.

rn being the desorption 
rate of n-butane, 
that is the rate of the overall process. If 
kznAng << keInAnH+ 
(16) 
as is justified 
by the fact that 
the rate- 
determining 
step is the surface reaction, 
from Eq. (14) there derives 
nA = klPn/k-lnc+ 
and therefore Eq. (15) becomes 
(17) 
rE = klkzPBn~/l;-oaH+ 
= bnktPBn g/+ 
(18) 
For 
small 
coverages, 
Eq. 
(5) 
becomes 
r = k,bePe; a comparison 
with 
Eq. (18) 
gives 
k, = kzne/nH+ 
09) 
Both ne and nn+ depend on the position of 
the Fermi level pLF 
of the solid and therefore 
also the reaction rate is affected by the value 
of the Fermi level. Since ne increases by 
increasing PF, while it is possible to show (14) 
that the concentration 
of a species bound to 
the catalyst surface with a strong donor bond 
(H-0) 
decreases by increasing 
PF, then 
globally the reaction rate should follow the 
Variation 
of pF. 
The previous analysis can be useful for 
the interpretation 
of the influence 
of the 
impurities 
added to the catalyst 
on its 
activity. 
As is known, foreign atoms added 
to a crystalline 
solid can replace the regular 
lattice atoms (substitutive 
solution) 
or can 
be thrown into interstitial 
positions or onto 
the surface of the crystal. 
The relative 
concentration 
of impurities 
in reticular 
or 
interstitial 
position is largely dominated by 
the values of the impurity 
and host ion 
radii. For the system under consideration 
t,be values of ionic radii are the following 
(A): 
A13+, 0.50; 
Cr3+, 0.69; 
Li+, 
0.60; 
Na+, 0.95 (20). From these values it derives 
that Li+ ions can substitute 
both Cr3+ and 
A13+ ions in the lattice 
much better than 
Na+ ions. The difficulty 
of Na+ ion to 
substitute 
Cr3+ ions, due to the higher ionic 
radius of the former, can hinder diffusion of 
sodium in the lattice during the preparation 
of the catalyst. Therefore in larger amounts 
it will tend to remain on interstitial 
positions 
at the surface of the catalyst. That means 
that 
sodium 
can act as an amphoteric 
impurity 
and only a small amount of Na+ 
ions can occupy ion vacancies of Cr3+. 
A monovalent 
alkaline atom present in a 
reticular 
position acts as an electron accep- 
tor, because it provides to the system only 
one electron, while the communal 
sharing 
system demands three @I). The indispensa- 
ble two electrons will be extracted from the 
normal electronic distribution 
of the crystal, 
leaving two partially 
free positive holes able 
to wander in the neighborhood of the defect. 
On the other hand a monovalent 
largely 
electropositive 
atom in an interstitial 
posi- 
tion acts as an electron donor, giving to the 
system one electron. 
The previous analysis seems to confirm 
the experimental 
results shown in Fig. 2; in 
n-BUTANE 
CATALYTIC DEHYDROGENATION 
165 
fact, the addition of lithium, 
that acts as an 
electron acceptor and decreases PF, gives at 
every concentration 
a decrease of catalyst 
activity. 
The addition 
of sodium gives a 
decrease of activity 
if its concentration 
is 
small and then it acts as an electron accep- 
t’or, followed by an increase of the activity 
at the higher concentrations, 
at which 
it 
acts as an electron donor. This fact seems to 
be confirmed by the behavior of the curve 
of Fig. 9, in which it can be seen that, while 
AE, increases monotonically 
by addition 
of 
lithium, 
it goes through 
a maximum 
by 
addition of sodium.
