Abstract
A novel design of microstructured membrane reactor with micro-channels formed between closely packed catalytic $laments is reported.
The system comprises $laments of 7 m in diameter and has a laminar 5ow with a short radial di6usion time. This leads to low pressure
drop and to a narrow residence time distribution (RTD) during reactor operation.
The latter device in combination with a membrane permeable to hydrogen is used in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The
catalytic $laments of Pt=Sn on alumina were active=selective and sustained periodic regeneration. This innovative micro-reactor system
allowed to control the selectivity to propene due to a narrow RTD. At propane conversions exceeding equilibrium, selectivities towards
propene up to 97% were attained.

1. Introduction
Micro-structured reactors are characterized by three-
dimensional structures in the sub-millimeter range. Mainly
multichannel reactors are currently used with channel diam-
eters between ten and several hundred micrometers. One of
the main features of micro-structured reactors is their high
surface to volume ratio, being 1â€“2 orders of magnitudes
higher as compared to traditional chemical reactors.
Due to the small reactor dimensions, di6usion times are
short and the in5uence of mass transfer on the rate of reaction
is substantially reduced. As heat transfer is greatly improved
if compared to conventional systems, higher reaction tem-
peratures are admissible allowing reduced reaction volumes
and amount of catalysts (Hardt, Ehrfeld, & Bussche, 2000).
Therefore, micro-structured reactors are particularly suitable
for fast endo- and exothermic reactions and for the design
of autothermal systems. Furthermore, the narrow residence
time distribution in microchannel reactors (Ehrfeld, 1995;
Ehrfeld, Hessel, & Haverkamp, 1999) allows to optimize
the contact time and to suppress formation of by-products
in complex reaction.

One of the main problems in using micro-structured
reactors for heterogeneously catalyzed reactions is the in-
troduction of a catalytic active phase. The easiest way
would be to $ll micro-channels by catalyst powder, as
proposed by Tonkovich and collaborators for hydrogen
generation (Daym et al., 2000; Fitzgerald et al., 2000).
The drawback of this method is the high pressure drop. In
addition, each channel must be packed identically to avoid
maldistribution.
Therefore, research is focused on the development of
thin catalytic layers deposited on the reactorsâ€™ walls within
the micro-structure. HG
onicke and coworkers (HG
onicke &
Wiessmeier, 1995; Wiessmeier & HG
onicke, 1998) chose alu-
minium as construction material for micro-channel reactors.
The speci$c surface of the micro-channels was increased
by anodic oxidation of the aluminium surface resulting in
a thin porous layer of -Al2O3. The obtained oxide layer
had a very regular pore structure oriented perpendicularly to
the 5ow direction. This porous layer served as support for
the catalytically active components. The use of aluminium
is restricted by temperatures up to 450
â—¦C. Therefore, di6er-
ent methods of deposition of active catalytic layers on other
materials are under development. Solâ€“gel methods are com-
monly proposed to obtain a porous support on the wall of the
micro-channels (Wiessmeier, Schubert, & HG
onicke, 1997).
Catalytically active phase can be deposited on the porous
layer by common precipitation or impregnation.

In the present paper, a novel concept of a micro-reactor
system is proposed and tested in the catalytic non-oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane. Production of propene via
non-oxidative catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has
technological constrains due to the high endothermicity
(IrH = 129 kJ=mol at 823 K and 0:14 MPa) and the un-
favourable thermodynamic equilibrium conversion of 22%
under the same conditions. Furthermore, at high temper-
atures required by the reaction thermodynamics, thermal
cracking occurs lowering the selectivity with coke deposi-
tion on the catalytic surface. To regenerate the catalyst, the
formed coke has to be burned o6 periodically in oxidative
atmosphere.
2. Reactor concept
The micro-structured system reported consists of a
two-zone tubular reactor of few millimeters in diameter
$lled with catalytically active $laments placed parallel to
the tube walls. The $laments are introduced in the form of
threads. The two zones are separated by a Pd-membrane
allowing to eliminate hydrogen from the reaction mixture,
thus exceeding equilibrium conversion.
Parallel $laments of few micro-meters in diameter
(3â€“10 m) (Wolfrath, Kiwi-Minsker, & Renken, 2000)
form micro-channels with 5ow hydrodynamics similar
to multi-channel micro-reactors. The equivalent diameter
(deq) of the channels for gas 5ow between the $laments
(see Fig. 1) depend on the diameter of the $laments (df)
and their geometric arrangement (Fig. 2). As the equivalent
diameter is de$ned as

The 5ow system described has a hydraulic diameter in the
range of a few microns ensuring laminar 5ow. At $rst glance,
the parabolic laminar 5ow pro$le should result in a vast
residence time distribution. But Tayler and Aris showed that
radial di6usion can compensate the broadening e6ect of the
parabolic 5ow pro$le (Baerns, Hofmann, & Renken, 1999).
For circular tubes, the axial dispersion coeLcient, Dax, is
given by
Dax = D + u2 d2
t
192 D;
(3)
where D is the molecular di6usion coeLcient, u the average
linear velocity, dt the tube diameter.
Due to the small tube diameters of micro-channels, the
radial di6usion time of gases is in the order of milliseconds

$laments. (b) SEM of catalytic $laments in a thread.

and the axial dispersion can be eLciently suppressed, as
shown by theoretical and experimental studies (Commenge,
Rouge, Renken, Corriou, & Matlosz, 2001; Rouge, Spoetzl,
Gebauer, Schenk, & Renken, 2001).
The micro-structured membrane reactor with $lamen-
tous catalyst was used in the continuous production of
propene from propane via non-oxidative dehydrogena-
tion. A Pd/Ag membrane, permeable to hydrogen, sepa-
rates two concentric zones of the tubular reactor shown
schematically in Fig. 3. On one side of the membrane
(zone I), the dehydrogenation takes place with simultane-
ous coke formation on the catalyst surface and di6usion of
hydrogen to zone II. On the other side of the membrane

(zone II), hydrogen is oxidized by air, thus generating heat
for the endothermic dehydrogenation in zoneI. Moreover,
due to the permanent oxidation of hydrogen, a high radial
concentration gradient of hydrogen is obtained. This allows
an eLcient removal of hydrogen from the reaction zone and
consequently to exceed reaction equilibrium. Simultane-
ously with the hydrogen oxidation, the deactivated catalyst
is regenerated by burning o6 coke from the catalyst sur-
face. The feeds of air and propane are switched periodically
between the two zones to produce propene continuously.
3. Experimental
Aluminoborosilicate glass $bres in woven form (Vetrotex
France SA) with a speci$c surface area of SSA = 2 m2 gâˆ’1
were used as starting material for the catalyst preparation.
First, the fabrics were treated at 90
â—¦C in 1:0 N aqueous so-
lutions of HCl to leach out the non-silica components of
the glass, then the material was rinsed in distilled water and
dried in air at 50
â—¦C overnight (Kiwi-Minsker, Youranov,
Slavinskaia, Zaikovskii, & Renken, 2000). By this proce-
dure the speci$c surface area is increased up to 290 m2 gâˆ’1
indicating that porous $laments were obtained. The $la-
mentâ€™s surfaces were then covered by -alumina via deposi-
tion/precipitation of aluminium hydroxide from aqueous so-
lution of a suitable salt followed by drying and calcinations
in air at 650
â—¦C during 3 h. The resulting support materialâ€”
alumina/silica $laments (ASF)â€”is stable up to 800
â—¦C, and
has a SSA in the range of 100â€“230 m2 gâˆ’1. The speci$c
surface area was determined by the BET method.
The active metals (Pt and Sn) were deposited via
two-steps impregnation from aqueous ammonia solutions
(pH = 10). SnCl2 and hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6)
(purum, Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland) were used
as precursors. Impregnation was followed by drying at
50
â—¦C overnight and calcination at 450
â—¦C in air for 1 h. The
concentrations of the solutions were adjusted to obtain a
catalyst formulation of 0.5%Ptâ€“1%Sn on ASF. This compo-
sition was reported to be selective towards propene and to
have acceptable long-term stability (Yarusov, Zatolokina,
Shitova, Belyi, & Ostrovskii, 1992).
The catalytic $laments were introduced into the tubular
reactor in the form of threads. Each thread with a diameter of
about 0:5 mm consists of a bundle of âˆ¼100 $laments, Fig.
1b), with a diameter of âˆ¼7 m. The catalytic threads were
placed in parallel into the tube to form a cylindrical catalytic
bed of di6erent lengths in the range of 10â€“200 mm. The
catalytic bed arranged in this manner has about 300 threads
per cm2 within the tube cross-section. The porosity of the
$lamentous packed bed is  âˆ¼
= 0:8. The speci$c surface per
volume is in the order of 108 m2 mâˆ’3 and thus, about 50
times higher compared to washcoated tubes of the same in-
ner diameter (Hatzlantonlou, Andersson, & SchG
oG
on, 1986).
The membrane used in this study consists of a Pd/Ag
(23 wt%) alloy in the form of a tube of 6 mm internal diam-
eter with a wall thickness of 70 m (Johnson Matthey and
Brandenberger SA, ZG
urich, Switzerland). The length of the
structured catalytic bed is Lcat = 130 mm, corresponding to
1:54 g catalyst in each zone. It is inserted in a quartz tube of
8:6 mm inner diameter (Fig. 4). The tube and shell volumes
are equal to 4:0 ml.
The reaction was carried out at a temperature of T =823 K
and a pressure of 0:14 MPa. Before reaction, the catalyst
was heated under nitrogen 5ow at 10 K minâˆ’1 up to the re-
action temperature. After 15 min of temperature stabiliza-
tion, nitrogen was replaced by a 5ow of pure propane and
the reaction products were monitored.
The reaction mixture was analyzed by gas chromatogra-
phy (Hewlett Packard, HP 6890, capillary column: Sulpeco
Carboxen 1010).
Conversion of propane was calculated according to Eq.
(4). The calculation does not consider the conversion of
propane to coke as its instantaneous formation is time de-
pendent and diLcult to estimate. Therefore, the calculation
is based on propane conversion to propene, ethane, ethene
and methane. The relative error is estimated to be in the or-
der of 2â€“4%

Residence time distribution in di6erent catalytic beds was
determined by measuring the response on a step function
(10% Ar in N2) via a quadrupole mass spectrometer (TSU
260D, Balzers, Balzers, Liechtenstein) in a larger tubular
reactor: L = 230 mm; ID = 15 mm; OD = 18 mm. The res-
idence time distribution (RTD) was measured in a tube
packed with the $lamentous catalyst and with particles of
silica and -alumina of di6erent shapes and sizes.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Residence time distribution
Hydrodynamics of gas 5ow through the micro-structured
$lamentous catalytic bed was studied and compared to dif-
ferent conventional packings. Experimental results are pre-
sented in Fig. 5. Under identical experimental conditions,
randomly packed beds showed signi$cantly broader RTD as
compared to the structured $lamentous packing.
The RTD is characterized by the mean residence time, T
t,
and the variance around the mean value, 2. Based on the
step response curves, the two parameters can be calculated
as follows (Baerns et al., 1999):

For the dispersion model, the Bodenstein number, Bo =
u L=Dax, characterizes the spreading of the residence times
in a tubular reactor. Dax is the axial dispersion coeLcient,
representing the spreading process (Baerns et al., 1999; Lev-
enspiel, 1999).
For the three packings shown in Fig. 5, the numerical
results are shown in Table 1.
Besides the signi$cantly narrower RTD in structured $l-
amentous packed reactors as compared to randomly packed
beds, the pressure drop is also considerably lower. For the
same volumetric gas 5ow of 30 cm3 minâˆ’1 (STP), the pres-
sure drop through the $lamentous packing was found to be
IP âˆ¼
= 7 hPa. This values is roughly 5 times lower com-
pared to the $xed bed packed with spheres of 100â€“160 m

diameter with the same volume and 3.5 times lower if com-
pared with reactors with the same mass of catalyst.
The pressure drop measured under laminar 5ow for the
structured reactor can be used to estimate the equivalent di-
ameter of the channels based on the well-known relationship
of Hagenâ€“Poisieulle.
Thus, the catalytic bed of 15 mm inner diameter consist-
ing of about 46,000 $laments is equivalent to N = 38; 000
cylindrical microchannels of 70 m diameter.
The estimated hydraulic diameter of 70 m is in the
same order of magnitude as for conventional multichannel
micro-reactors.
4.2. Catalyst testing and reactor operation
The propane dehydrogenation was $rst performed in a
quartz tube reactor of 6 mm internal diameter. At 823 K
and 0:14 MPa, propane conversion of 22% correspond-
ing to thermodynamic equilibrium is reached. Observed
by-products are methane, ethane and ethene. Under iden-
tical reaction conditions, the conversion was found to be
similar on powdered and on $lamentous catalyst (Wolfrath,
Kiwi-Minsker, & Renken, 2001). Deactivation due to coke
formation is slow in both cases. But the selectivity towards
propene is higher over the $lamentous catalyst: a maximum
of 95.5% is reached, instead of 88%, over the powdered
catalyst. This is explained by the narrower RTD obtained in
the structured bed, thus suppressing undesired consecutive
reactions.
The reaction was then carried out in the membrane reactor
with micro-structured catalytic bed installed in zones I and
II (Fig. 4). The residence time was increased to 15 s to maxi-
mize propane conversion. At the same temperature and pres-
sure, the initial conversion in the membrane reactor reached
30% thus exceeding signi$cantly the equilibrium conversion
of 22% (Fig. 6). Due to coke formation, the catalytic activity
decreases with time on stream. According to the coke forma-
tion scheme proposed by Larsson et al. (Larsson, Henriks-
son, & Andersson, 1997), the equilibrium between propene
and coke precursors is shifted to the latter due to hydrogen
removal from the catalytic bed. This explains the faster deac-
tivation of the catalyst in the membrane reactor as seen from
Fig. 6.
Propene selectivity is enhanced in the membrane reactor:
the amount of by-products is twice lower and propene se-
lectivity reaches 97%. This increase can be explained by the
lower concentration of hydrogen in the gas phase, suppress-
ing hydroisomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions (Mat-
suda, Koike, Kubo, & Kikuchi, 1993).

Finally, the two zone micro-structured membrane reac-
tor was tested in a long-term reaction run. Temperature and
pressure were held constant at 823 K and 0:14 MPa, respec-
tively. Pure propane was fed in one zone, whereas hydrogen
was continuously oxidized by air under the same conditions
in the second zone together with the catalyst regeneration by
burning o6 the coke. Every 85 min, the feeds were switched
between the two zones. The experimental results are shown
on Fig. 7. Within the $rst cycle, the conversion drops in both
zones from about 16 to 7%. After the oxidation period, the
initial conversion increases, but the activity observed in the
$rst cycle over fresh catalyst cannot be reached. After 4 re-
action/regeneration periods, the conversion pro$les become
reproducible in both zones. The propane conversion varies
regularly between 7% and 5%.
Compared to industrial processes with selectivities in the
range of 80â€“90% (Eisele & Killpack, 2000), the observed
propene selectivity of 95â€“97% is relatively high. Further-
more, the selectivity is not e6ected by the catalyst deactiva-
tion being independent on time-on-stream and the di6erent
reactor zones.
5. Conclusions
A novel micro-structured catalytic bed was reported,
which is made of long threads consisting of $ne $laments of
7 m in diameter. In this micro-structured packing, gas 5ow
through micro-channels formed between the $laments. The
advantages of the microstructure with estimated hydraulic
channel diameters of âˆ¼
= 70 m, namely laminar 5ow, low
pressure drop and narrow residence time distribution is
con$rmed.
Applied to non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, it al-
lowed a better control of reaction time due to the narrower
residence time distribution leading to increased propene se-
lectivity from 88% to 95%.
In a reactor with a hydrogen permeable membrane, the
propene selectivity was increased up to 97% due to the
removal of H2 suppressing hydroisomerization and hy-
drogenolysis reactions. As the hydrogen is oxidised in a
second compartment integrated in the system, autothermal
reactor behavior can be realized. In long-term runs, stable
activity and high selectivity could be achieved in periodic
operation.
The presented micro-structured packings gives new
opportunities for the design of heterogeneous catalytic
reactors.
