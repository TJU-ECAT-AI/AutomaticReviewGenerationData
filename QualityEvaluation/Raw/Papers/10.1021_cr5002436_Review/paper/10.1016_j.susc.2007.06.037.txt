Abstract
The adsorption of ethene (C2H4) on Pt(111) and the Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys has been investigated experi-
mentally by high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption. The experimental results have
been compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations allowing us to perform a complete assignment of all vibration modes
and loss features to the species present on the surfaces. On Pt(111) as well as on the Pt–Sn surface alloys an g2 di-r-bonded conformation
of ethene has been found to be the most stable adsorbed form. In addition to this majority species a minor amount of p-bonded ethene
has been identiﬁed, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy than on the other surfaces. Additionally the HREELS spectra of
ethene on Pt(111) and the Pt–Sn surface alloys diﬀer only slightly in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks.

1. Introduction
Ethene is a major intermediate in chemical industry and
moreover a good model agent for the investigation of the
adsorption of alkenes on alloy surfaces. The world produc-
tion of ethene exceeded 75,000,000 metric tons per year in
2005 [1]. Pt-based catalysts are important in heterogeneous
catalysis, e.g. for conversion of ethane to ethene by oxidative
dehydrogenation in a ﬂow tube reactor. In this context Pt–Sn
catalysts are used for an optimized conversion and selectivity
[2] and are superior to pure platinum catalysts. Moreover
these bimetallic catalysts are important for suppressing the
hydrogenolysis that can occur on pure platinum [3,4].
A detailed microscopic understanding of the catalytic
process can only be gained through a simpliﬁcation of
the structure of the model catalyst by using single crystals.
This will allow us to attribute the catalytic properties to
speciﬁc sites on the atomic scale of the catalyst surface.
Good candidates for such as systematic investigation are
the two ordered Pt–Sn surface alloys ﬁrst reported by Paﬀet
and Windham [5]. These Pt3Sn and Pt2Sn surface alloys are
well characterized by a variety of techniques [6] and can be
easily prepared by annealing of a Sn-covered Pt(111) sur-
face at high temperatures. For annealing temperatures of
about 800 K a ð

observed corresponding to the Pt2Sn surface alloy, whereas
at temperatures of about 1015 K a (2 · 2) LEED pattern
indicates the formation of a Pt3Sn surface alloy [5–9].
Extensive studies of the adsorption of hydrocarbons on
PtxSn/Pt(111) show a suppressed dehydrogenation on
these surface alloys compared to the pure Pt(111) surface
[10–13]. Investigations of ethene on these surfaces with
temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and high-reso-
lution energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) suggested that
the absence of dehydrogenation is due to missing adjacent
platinum 3-fold hollow sites, which are needed during the

development of the decomposition product ethylidyne
[10,11].
The adsorption and decomposition of ethene on the
Pt(111) surfaces has been copiously investigated by vari-
ous techniques. Cassuto et al. observed by NEXAFS that
ethene adsorbs p-bonded on the Pt(111) surface at temper-
atures below 52 K [14,15]; above this temperature ethene
changes its conformation to a di-r-bonded species with
the C–C axis parallel to the surface. The ethene adsorption
on
Pt(111)
was
also
thoroughly
investigated
using
HREELS and temperature programmed desorption [16–
20] and the adsorption mode is generally described as being
of di-r type. These experimental ﬁndings are corroborated
by a number of theoretical calculations, which show that
the di-r species is by at least 30% more stable than the
p-bonded conformation on the Pt(111) surface [21–24].
The p species has however been found to coexist with the
di-r species under high pressure conditions [25] and its
importance for the hydrogenation of ethene on Pt(111)
was pointed out by O
¨ fner and Zaera [26,27] and Cremer
et al. [28]. Above 240 K a conversion to ethylidyne occurs
[16,18,19,29], which is accompanied by a self-hydrogena-
tion of a minor fraction of the ethene [27].
In this work we aim at the more complete understanding
of the bonding mechanism of ethene on Pt(111) and the
two ordered PtxSn surface alloys. To this end, the adsorp-
tion of ethene was investigated experimentally using
HREELS and TPD, and these results are compared to the-
oretical results from DFT calculations. The combination of
experimental and theoretical results provides us with exact
bonding distances, angles and energies of the adsorbed eth-
ene species. Furthermore, a full assignment of the vibration
modes of the adsorbed ethene and ethylidyne will be given.
2. Experimental details
The experiments were performed in an ultrahigh vac-
uum (UHV) chamber operated at a base pressure of
108 Pa. The system was equipped with instrumentation
for high-resolution electron loss spectroscopy (HREELS),
Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron
diﬀraction (LEED) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer
(QMS) for temperature programmed desorption (TPD).
For the experiments a disk-shaped Pt(111) sample of
9 mm diameter (MaTeck, Ju
¨lich) was used, which was
mounted between twisted tantalum wires wedged into
grooves in the side of the crystal. The cooling was provided
by a LN2 reservoir, which was directly connected, to the
sample holder.
Cleaning of the sample was achieved by cycles of Ar+
ion sputtering (2 keV) at 900 K and annealing at 1150 K.
The cleanliness of the Pt(111) was monitored by AES
and HREELS.
TPD measurements were made using the QMS in line-
of-sight with the sample surface and using a linear heating
rate of 2 K/s, which was controlled by a Eurotherm 2408
temperature controller. The HREELS spectrometer was
run at a resolution of 4 meV and a primary energy of
3.0 eV. Spectra were recorded in specular geometry at a
scattering angle of 60 relative to the surface normal. An
Al2O3 crucible, which was wrapped by a tungsten ﬁlament,
was used for evaporation of Sn. The temperature was con-
trolled by a thermocouple of type K.

responding to the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. In a temper-
ature range between 1000 and 1050 K a p(2 · 2) LEED
pattern was obtained, characteristic of the Pt3Sn/Pt(111)
surface alloy. Ethene exposure was performed by backﬁll-
ing the UHV system with research grade ethene (99.95%,
Air Liquide) to a pressure 1.5 · 106 Pa. The exposures
are given in Langmuirs (1 L = 1.33 · 104 Pa s).
3. Computational details
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were
performed with the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package
(VASP) [30–32]. This program permits periodic density
functional theory (DFT) calculations using a plane wave
basis set and the PAW method. The PAW method is a fro-
zen core method, which utilizes the exact valence wave
functions instead of pseudo potentials [33]. The generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) level was used with the
functional of Predew and Wang 91 [34].
The idealized surface was represented by a periodic four-
layer slab, on which the adsorption can take place on only
one side. For modeling the alloy surfaces Pt2Sn/Pt(111)
and Pt3Sn/Pt(111) it is supposed that only the ﬁrst layer
contains Sn atoms. Each slab is separated from its periodic
image in z-direction by 5 layers of vacuum (11.5 A
˚ ).
Only one molecule is adsorbed per (3 · 3) unit cell
(h = 1/9 ML). For all structures the geometry optimization
included all degrees of freedom of the adsorbed ethene
molecule and the ﬁrst two layers of the surface. The two
following layers of Pt below are frozen. The same inter-
atomic distance for the surface alloys like in pure Pt
(2.82 A
˚ ) (optimized from Pt bulk calculations) is used. This
assumption is justiﬁed because the experimental lattice
parameter is imposed by the Pt bulk, and the larger Sn
atoms in the ﬁrst layer evade this compression by an out-
ward displacement, which induces a Pt-Sn distance of
2.86 A
˚ [13]. The adsorption energy is deﬁned as the diﬀer-
ence between the energy of the whole adsorption system
and that of the pure slab and the free ethene.
Since the molecules are adsorbed on one side of the slab
only, the unit cell has a net dipole moment resulting in elec-
trostatic interactions between the periodic slabs, which
aﬀect the total energy. A correction has been applied to
the energy and calculated potential in order to compensate
J.M. Essen et al. / Surface Science 601 (2007) 3472–3480
3473
for this eﬀect. This correction does not exceed 30 meV for
Pt and 60 meV for the alloys.
The HREELS spectra were simulated by the calculation
of the vibration frequencies [35] and the loss intensities
caused by dipole scattering. Within the harmonic approach
these values can be derived by a numerical calculation of
the second derivatives of the potential energy surface.
Any surface phonon coupling is neglected. The intensities
of the HREELS-spectra are calculated considering only
the dipole scattering mechanism by the formula given in
Ref. [35]. The loss intensities are proportional to the square
of the dynamic dipole moments and to a function that de-
pends on experimental parameters and the inverse of the
dipole moment [13].
4. Results
In order to establish reference data and record enhanced
HREELS spectra that can be compared to the theoretically
predicted ones we reinvestigated the adsorption of ethene
on the Pt(111) surface. Likewise new TPD spectra have
been acquired in order to deduced the relevant annealing
temperature for the HREELS studies.
The TPD spectra (Fig. 1) of ethene (m/e = 27), ethane
(m/e = 30) and hydrogen (m/e = 2) from the Pt(111) sur-
face, after diﬀerent exposures of ethene adsorbed at 90 K,
are in good agreement with previous studies [17,26]. The
TPD spectra show that the molecular desorption of ethene
starts only for exposures above 1.2 L with a maximum of
the desorption rate at about 282 K. This maximum shifts
with increasing ethene exposure to 273 K. Using a Redhead
analysis [36] assuming ﬁrst order kinetics and a pre-expo-
nential factor of 1013 s1, this corresponds to a shift of
the desorption energy from 74 kJ/mol to 71 kJ/mol for
increasing exposure up to saturation. Near saturation
exposure (2 L) a low temperature shoulder at 242 K
develops. The desorption spectra of hydrogen (m/e: 2) are
characterized by two desorption peaks at about 300 K
and 490 K, which result from the decomposition of the
remaining ethene to ethylidyne (C2H3), and the further
dehydrogenation of the ethylidyne on the Pt(111) surface
to CHx species, respectively. In agreement with O
¨ fner
and Zaera [26,27] we found a desorption of small amounts
of ethane (m/e: 30) resulting from hydrogenation of ethene.
On the Pt–Sn surface alloys a decomposition of ethene is
not detected in the TPD spectra. The ethene desorbs fully
intact and accordingly neither hydrogen nor ethane are
found in the TPD spectra. The corresponding ethene
desorption spectra compared to the spectrum at saturation
coverage of ethene on Pt(111) are displayed in Fig. 2.
Obviously, with increasing Sn percentage the desorption
maximum of saturated monolayers of ethene on the surface
alloys is shifted to lower temperature. For the Pt3Sn/
Pt(111) surface alloy it is found at 226 K in good agree-
ment with previous studies [11]. The shape of the TPD
trace resulting from the ethene desorption (m/e: 27) from
the Pt2Sn surface alloy is obviously diﬀerent from that of
the other two surfaces. Here two well deﬁned desorption
states are measured at 184 K and 163 K, respectively. Only
the former has been reported by Paﬀett et al. [11], which is
most likely due to the higher adsorption temperature used
in that study. The good separation of the two peaks sug-
gests that two diﬀerent surface species may be present
and this hypothesis will be supported by the HREELS
experiments discussed below. A Redhead [36] analysis,
under the assumption of a ﬁrst order kinetics and a
pre-exponential factor of 1013 s1, gives the correspond-
ing desorption energies, which are summarized in Table 1
along with the adsorption energies calculated with DFT.

Seemingly the calculated values for the surface alloys are
in good agreement with the experimentally measured ones
but we must point out that this is rather by chance. In gen-
eral the values gained by DFT correspond to adsorption at
zero K whereas the desorption energies deduced from TPD
correspond to a kinetically controlled out-of-equilibrium
process, which does not necessarily yield a correct adsorp-
tion energy. Only for the Pt(111) surface a rather big dif-
ference between the experimental desorption energy and
the calculated adsorption energy is encountered. This can
be interpreted in terms of a competition between desorp-
tion and dehydrogenation in this case, which has also been
observed for cyclopentene on Pt(111) [13]. In summary the
TPD measurements show that the desorption temperature
and the adsorption energy of ethene decreases with increas-
ing Sn content of the surface.
After discussing the main features of the ethene desorp-
tion from Pt(111) and the Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and the Pt2Sn/
Pt(111) surface, we now turn to the presentation of the
HREELS results. All HREELS spectra were taken at
100 K after ﬂashing the respective surface to tempera-
tures, which corresponded to characteristic changes in the
TPD spectra. The HREELS spectra for a successively
heated saturation coverage of ethene on Pt(111) are shown
in Fig. 3.
Obviously the spectra are virtually unchanged in the
temperature range from 90 K to about 215 K. Only after
annealing to 269 K new loss peaks resulting from the for-
mation of an ethylidyne species appear and the intensities
of the previously present loss peaks decreases. Above
399 K only the new loss features (1406 cm1, 1377 cm1,
1115 cm1, 966 cm1, 469 cm1, 421 cm1) of ethylidyne
are present. After heating to higher temperatures (518 K)
only two new broad loss features (1026 cm1, 792 cm1)
are present, which vanish at even higher temperatures,
and can be assigned to a methylidene (CH) surface species.
The majority of the loss peaks in the temperature range
below 269 K can be assigned to di-r ethene (1416 cm1,
1170 cm1, 1040 cm1, 987 cm1, 762 cm1, 641 cm1,

452 cm1). However, the double peak at 1170 cm1 and
1197 cm1 points to the presence of a diﬀerent ethene spe-
cies, which turns out to be p-bonded. A full assignment of
the vibration modes of the various surface species is given
in the discussion below.
Similar annealing series have been performed after eth-
ene adsorption on the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) and the Pt3Sn/
Pt(111) surface alloys. Again up to the temperatures corre-
sponding to the ﬁrst desorption peak in the TPD spectra
signiﬁcant changes in the HREELS spectra are not encoun-
tered. However, in the case of the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface
after
desorption
of
ethene
at
163 K
the
peak
at
1498 cm1 vanishes and the peaks at 966 and 1212 cm1
decrease signiﬁcantly in intensity (Fig. 4). We attribute this
to the desorption of a p-bonded ethene species. Finally,
after annealing to 270 K only weak traces of a remaining
species are left. These can either be due to readsorption
of ethene during cooling or to an incomplete alloy layer,
which may have some remaining Pt(111) patches that
cause a spurious dehydrogenation.
The HREELS spectra in Fig. 5 show the evolution of
ethene on Pt3Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy during annealing.
Apparently heating to 230 K leads to an overall decrease
of the loss intensities, which concerns all peaks except the
one at 455 cm1. This indicates that in contrast to the
Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface a separation of diﬀerently adsorbed
species by annealing is not possible on this surface. This
observation is in good agreement with the presence of just
one peak in the desorption spectrum (Fig. 2). Again after
desorption of the ethene at 400 K only slight contamina-
tions remain on the surface, which can be attributed to
imperfections of the (2 · 2) Pt–Sn surface alloy.
5. Discussion
First of all the vibration features of the adsorbed ethene
on the three surfaces Pt(111), Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/
Pt(111) will be compared. In Fig. 6 the corresponding
HREELS spectra recorded after monolayer adsorption at
90 K are displayed. Apparently there are only small diﬀer-
ences in terms of peak positions and relative intensities.
This is in line with the conclusion that the di-r conﬁgura-
tion is the dominating species on all three surfaces. In par-
ticular the energetic position of the ms(PtC) stretching
vibration (450 cm1) is virtually constant on all three sur-
faces suggesting that the local interaction of the ethene
molecule with the bonding Pt atoms is similar. This view
is corroborated by the fact that the pr parameter, which

was introduced by Stuve and Madix [37] in order to char-
acterize the bond order of the adsorbed ethene, takes a
value of 1 on all three surfaces (see Table 2). This means
that the bond order of the C–C bond of the adsorbed eth-
ene is close to unity, which in turn indicates a hybridization
close to sp3 as in gas phase ethane. The same procedure
applied to the minority species yields a pr parameter of
0.5 indicating a bond order of 1.5 for this ethene confor-
mation, which indicates a signiﬁcant rehybridization of this
species and thus a formation of a true chemical bond.
5.1. Assignment of the vibration modes
By comparing experimental and calculated HREELS
spectra we are able to completely assign the observed loss
peaks to the molecular vibration modes of the adsorbed
ethene molecules. Furthermore this procedure undoubtedly
allows us to verify the presence of the proposed p-bonded
ethene species. Fig. 7 shows the comparison between the
experimental and the calculated HREELS spectra of
di-r- and p-bonded ethene on Pt(111). The energetic
positions of the experimental loss peaks are very well
reproduced by the calculated spectra – especially in the
intermediate energy region (400–1500 cm1). The devia-
tions for lower and higher energies are attributed to the
neglect of the phonon coupling and anharmonicity, respec-
tively. The full assignment of the vibration modes is shown
in Table 3.
In this way 13 of the experimentally detected loss peaks
could be assigned to the corresponding normal modes of

from the p-species. The most intensive loss features in the

tion (452 cm1). The presence of the p species is easily pro-
ven by the appearance of a double peak at 1170 and
1197 cm1. In the calculated spectrum of the di-r species
only a single loss is found in this region (1177 cm1) and
an additional intense loss is found in the calculated spec-
trum of the p species at 1202 cm1. Similarly the experi-
mental peak at 937 cm1 (m10) is most likely derived from
the intense peak 948 cm1 in the calculated spectrum. If
we compare our vibration assignment to the data published
by Steininger et al. [19] only minor diﬀerences are encoun-
tered except for the fact that these authors did not identify
the p species. Concerning the di-r species there are two dif-
ferences, which should be pointed out. In Ref. [16,19] the
loss peak at 661 cm1 is identiﬁed as qs(CH2) mode but
according to our calculations it has to be assigned to a frus-
trated rotation (fR) of the di-r species. Accordingly we ﬁnd
the qs(CH2) at much higher energy (m11, 935 cm1). In this
energy range Steininger et al. could not resolve this feature
in the spectra.
Fig. 8 shows the comparison between the experimental
and calculated HREELS-spectra of di-r- and p-bonded
ethene on the Pt3Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Again the dou-
ble peak at 1165 and 1222 cm1 can only be explained if the
coexistence of the di-r and p species on the surface is as-
sumed. In general the correspondence between the experi-
mental and the theoretical spectra in terms of peak
positions is excellent. The complete assignment of the loss
features for the two surface alloys is shown in Table 4
along with a comparison to the data published by Paﬀett
et al. [11]. The situation is comparable for the HREELS

spectrum of ethene on Pt2Sn/Pt(111), which is shown in
Fig. 9. Again the presence of r- and p-bonded ethene on
the surface has to be assumed. However in this case the loss
peak in the experimental spectrum at 1172 cm1 is clearly
dominated by the corresponding peak of the p species
(1182 cm1). Furthermore a larger abundance of this spe-
cies is also suggested by the relatively strong peak at
1498 cm1, which was not present on the other two sur-
faces. It is also this peak that vanishes almost completely
if the Pt2Sn surface is heated to 170 K (Fig. 4) indicating
that the p species is desorbing in the peak at 163 K
(Fig. 2) as stated above. The relatively high intensity of this
low temperature desorption peaks in conjunction with the
HREELS assignments ﬁnally prove the large abundance
of the p species on the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy.
The larger amount of p ethene relative to di-r ethene,
which is found on the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy com-
pared to the other two surfaces, can be rationalized by
comparing the corresponding adsorption energies. The dif-
ference of the adsorption energy of p ethene and di-r eth-
ene on the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy is only 11.4 kJ/mol
(Table 5), while the corresponding value on the other two
surfaces is much bigger – about 35.2 kJ/mol on the
Pt(111)-surface and 25.1 kJ/mol on the Pt3Sn/Pt(111) sur-
face alloy. It is worthwhile comparing our theoretical re-
sults to former results (Table 5). Not surprisingly the
DFT adsorption energies found here for ethene on
Pt(111) correspond very well to the values found by Hir-
schl et al. who were using the same DFT package for the
computations [24] but are considerably lower than the val-
ues found by Watwe et al. [23]. This is most likely due to
the fact that Watwe et al. used only 3 layer thick slabs

and only the top most layer was relaxed, which is not suf-
ﬁcient for getting precise results. The comparison of the
Pt3Sn alloy is not so straightforward since in Ref. [23] the
bulk alloy is treated. However, the same trend as for
Pt(111) is found. The overestimation of the adsorption
energies in Ref. [23] seems thus to be systematic. Moreover,
as far as the dramatic decrease of the adsorption energy on
the alloy surfaces is concerned, our work and the work of
Watwe et al. are – as far as the lowering of the adsorption
strength on the alloys is concerned – in line with the TPD
results and show the behavior also found for cyclopentene
on the Pt–Sn surface alloys [13].
6. Conclusions
The adsorption of ethene on the three surfaces Pt(111),
Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) was investigated experi-
mentally by TPD and HREELS as well as theoretically
by DFT calculations.
On the Pt(111) and both PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys
ethene preferentially adsorbs in a di-r conformation occu-
pying pure platinum bridge sites. However on all surfaces a
coadsorbed p species has been identiﬁed, which is rather
abundant on Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface because the diﬀerence
in adsorption energy of the di-r and the p is small species
on this surface (11.4 kJ/mol). This p species has formerly
only been identiﬁed on Pt(111) at temperatures below
52 K [14,15].
Most importantly – as in the case of cyclopentene [13] –
the vibration spectra of the adsorbed ethene are only
weakly inﬂuenced despite the strong decrease of the
adsorption energy on the surface alloys compared to
Pt(111). This suggests a similar hybridization of the mole-
cules on all three surfaces. This result is corroborated by
the almost identical pr parameters for the ethene on the
diﬀerent surfaces.
Finally, the comparison of the calculated vibration spec-
tra with the experimental ones allows us to perform a com-
plete assignment of the vibration modes of the adsorbed
ethene species.
