The inﬂuence of calcination and reduction temperatures on the catalytic properties of Pd–Cu and Pt–Cu
bimetallic catalysts supported on activated carbon for the reduction of nitrates was studied. The catalysts
were prepared using different calcination and reduction temperatures, and the respective activities and
selectivities for the reduction of nitrates in water with hydrogen were assessed. It was found that the
different preparation conditions lead to different catalytic performances. For both catalysts, the activity
decreases by increasing calcination and reduction temperatures, whereas the effect on the selectivity
is not uniform. For the 1%Pd–0.3%Cu (wt.%) catalyst, the nitrate conversion after 5 h of reaction varies
from 93% (sample calcined at 200 ◦C and not reduced) to 25% (sample calcined and reduced at 400 ◦C).
The formation of alloys during the preparation of the catalysts is prejudicial for nitrate reduction. In
all the preparation conditions tested the Pd–Cu pair is more selective for the transformation of nitrate
into nitrogen. All the samples have been characterized by nitrogen adsorption at −196 ◦C, CO adsorption
microcalorimetry, TPR, XRD, XPS and TEM.

1. Introduction
Nitrate concentrations in surface water, and especially in
groundwater, have increased recently in many locations in the
world, including Europe. The catalytic reduction with hydrogen
has been suggested in the literature as a promising method for
nitrate removal from water, without the drawbacks of the conven-
tional methods [1,2]. This process was reported for the ﬁrst time
by Vorlop and Tacke [3], and consists in the reduction of nitrate
to nitrogen over bimetallic catalysts in the presence of a reduc-
ing agent. The formation of nitrite as intermediate and ammonium
as by-product is considered the main disadvantage of this process
[2]. Previous studies on the heterogeneous catalytic nitrate reduc-
tion have shown that bimetallic catalysts are much more efﬁcient
than the monometallic ones. The catalyst is usually composed of a
noble metal, mainly Pd or Pt but also Ru, Rh or Ir, and a promoter
metal, such as Cu, Sn, Ag, Ni, Fe or In on different supports (alumina
[4–10], silica [11–13], titania [14–16], activated carbon [17–24],
niobia [25], hydrotalcite [26,27], ceria [28,29], tin oxide [30,31],
polymers [32–35]). Among them, Pd–Cu, Pd–Sn and Pt–Cu seem to

be the most effective, but are still inadequate in terms of selectivity
to nitrogen [19,24]. The activity and selectivity of the bimetallic cat-
alyst are highly dependent on the interaction between the metals,
and this can be controlled by the preparation method, the nature
of the promoter, the metal/promoter ratio and the operation con-
ditions [36]. Alloying of metals may result in important changes in
their activities and selectivities [9]. Segregation phenomena of the
metal phases can occur during the preparation of the catalysts. The
metal of lower energy of sublimation tends to migrate to the sur-
face. However, this surface enrichment with one of the two metals
depends on a large number of parameters, such as the interactions
of the metal with the support and the preparation and activation
methods [9]. The selection of the support is also important for this
process, since it has been shown that the support may affect the
catalytic activity and selectivity [36].
Epron et al. [9] investigated the inﬂuence of oxidizing and reduc-
tion treatments, at ambient temperature or at 400 ◦C, in a bimetallic
Pt–Cu catalyst supported on alumina. They concluded that the cat-
alytic activity for nitrate reduction in water is dependent on the
Pt and Cu distribution on the catalyst surface, which is strongly
affected by the pre-treatments. In a more recent work, Sá et al.
[37] studied the inﬂuence of the reduction temperature in the per-
formance of a Pd–Cu catalysts supported on alumina, and they also
observed signiﬁcant changes in the catalytic activity. Gavagnin et al.

[31] reported that ZrO2 and SnO2 can be used as supports for Pd–Cu
in the nitrate reduction, and the activities and selectivities of the
catalyst can be improved by decreasing the reduction temperature.
Gao et al. [16] observed that Pd–Cu catalysts supported on titanium
dioxide and treated at high temperatures (873 K) exhibit lower
activity than non-thermally treated catalysts, probably because of
the aggregation of active metal species caused by the high temper-
ature treatment.
Activated carbons have been used in heterogeneous catalysis,
both as catalysts on their own or as catalyst support. It has been
proved that they have a great potential as catalyst support, espe-
cially for the expensive noble metals, since a high metal loading and
dispersion can be achieved. Furthermore, the interaction between
the active phase and the support can improve the catalytic activ-
ity [38]. In the present work, the inﬂuence of different calcination
and reduction temperatures on the catalytic behaviour of acti-
vated carbon supported Pd–Cu and Pt–Cu bimetallic catalysts in the
hydrogen-mediated reduction of nitrates in water has been studied.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
The active metals were supported on a commercial activated
carbon, NORIT GAC 1240 PLUS (ACo), ground to a particle diame-
ter between 0.1 mm and 0.3 mm. The catalysts were prepared by
incipient wetness co-impregnation, from aqueous solutions of the
corresponding metal salts (H2PtCl6, PdCl2, Cu(NO3)2). During the
impregnation, the samples were placed in an ultrasonic bath. Then,
the samples were dried at 100 ◦C for 24 h. Different temperatures
were selected for calcination (TCal) under a nitrogen ﬂow for 1 h,
and reduction (TRed) under hydrogen ﬂow for 3 h. No calcined and
no reduced catalysts (NCal NRed) were also studied; however, these
samples could be considered calcined in air at 100 ◦C, once they
were dried in the oven during their preparation. The contents of
noble and promoter metals were maintained constant at 1 wt.% and
0.3 wt.%, respectively. For the pair Pd–Cu the composition 2 wt.% of
Pd and 1% of Cu was also checked.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
The catalysts were characterized using different techniques:
N2 adsorption at −196 ◦C, temperature programme reduction
(TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), CO adsorption
microcalorimetry, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS).
The textural characterization of the materials was based on the
corresponding N2 adsorption isotherms, determined at −196 ◦C
with a Coulter Omnisorp 100 CX apparatus. BET surface areas (SBET)
were calculated, as well as the micropore volumes (Vmicro) and
mesopore surface areas (Smeso) according to the t-method.
TPR experiments were carried out in a AMI-200 (Altamira
Instruments) apparatus; the sample (150 mg) was heated at
5 ◦C/min up to 600 ◦C under a ﬂow of 5% (v/v) H2 diluted in He (total
ﬂow rate of 30 Ncm3/min). The H2 consumption was followed by
a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and by mass spectrometry
(Dymaxion 200 amu, Ametek).
TEM analyses were obtained using a LEO 906E microscope oper-
ating at a 120 kV accelerating voltage.
Microcalorimetric measurements were performed at 25 ◦C
using a Setaram BT2.15D heat-ﬂux calorimeter. The calorime-
ter was connected to a volumetric system employing a Baratron
capacitance manometer for precision pressure measurement
(±0.001 Torr). The maximum leak rate of the volumetric system
(including the calorimetric cell) was 10−5 Torr/min in a system vol-
ume of approximately 60 cm3. The catalysts (between 0.15 g and
0.5 g) were calcined for 1 h and reduced for 3 h in a special cell
with high purity helium and hydrogen (50 Ncm3/min), respectively.
After reduction, the sample was out-gassed at the reduction tem-
perature for 15 min, and then purged at the same temperature for
1 h in high purity helium to remove any adsorbed hydrogen. Then,
it was sealed in a Pyrex NMR tube and placed in a special calori-
metric cell. When thermal equilibrium was reached, the capsule
was broken, and small pulses of CO were introduced until satu-
ration was achieved. The resulting heat response for each pulse
was recorded as a function of time and integrated to determine
the energy released. The differential heat (kJ/mol) was deﬁned as
the negative of the enthalpy change of adsorption per mole of gas
adsorbed.
XRD spectra were recorded on a PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffrac-
tometer with Cu K radiation source ( = 0.154 nm) and with a
beam voltage of 50 kV and 40 mA of beam current. The data were
collected in the 2 range of 10–90◦with a scanning rate of 0.017◦/s.
XPS analyses were performed with a VG Scientiﬁc ESCALAB 200
A spectrometer using a non-monochromatised Mg K radiation
(1253.6 eV). The pressure in the analysis chamber was always lower
than 1 × 10−7 Pa. The charging effects were corrected using the C1s
peak, which was ﬁxed on all samples at a binding energy (BE) of
285 eV. XPS data were ﬁtted using the software XPSpeak.
2.3. Catalysts evaluation
The catalytic tests were carried out in a semi-batch reactor,
equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a thermostatic jacket, at room
temperature and atmospheric pressure, and using hydrogen as
reducing agent. Initially, 790 mL of deionised water and 400 mg of
catalyst were fed into the reactor, the magnetic stirrer was adjusted
to 700 rpm and the gas mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide
(1:1, ﬂow rate = 200 Ncm3/min) was passed through the reactor
during 15 min to remove oxygen; CO2 acts as pH buffer (pH = 5.5).
After that period, 10 mL of a nitrate solution, prepared from NaNO3,
was added to the reactor, in order to obtain an initial NO3−con-
centration equal to 100 ppm. Preliminary studies were carried out
varying the stirring rate and it was checked that under the selected
conditions there was no external diffusional limitations.
Small samples were taken from the reactor for determination of
nitrate, nitrite and ammonium concentrations after deﬁned peri-
ods. Nitrate and nitrite ions were simultaneously determined by
HPLC using a Hitachi Elite Lachrom apparatus equipped with a
diode array detector. The stationary phase was a Hamilton PRP-
X100 column (150 mm × 4.1 mm) working at room temperature
under isocratic conditions. The mobile phase was a 0.1 M solution of
NaCl:CH3OH (45:55). Ammonium ions were determined by poten-
tiometry using a convenient selective electrode. pH values were
also measured.
The dissolved amounts of Pd, Pt and Cu were measured by
atomic absorption spectroscopy, using the remaining solution after
reaction tests. No leaching of Pd or Pt was detected at the end of
the reaction, but in some experiments small amounts of dissolved
Cu were observed in the solution. For example, for the catalyst
2%Pd–1%Cu ACo a concentration of 0.327 mg/L of Cu was detected
in the case of the sample NCal NRed, corresponding to a leaching of
7%, which was the highest value measured; this value decreases to
0.6% for the catalyst TCal = 400 ◦C TRed = 400 ◦C. On the contrary, in
the case of Pt–Cu catalysts no dissolved Cu was measured for the
sample NCal NRed.
The selectivities of nitrite, ammonium and nitrogen were calcu-
lated as:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalysts characterization
3.1.1. Textural properties
Textural properties obtained from the N2 adsorption isotherms
at −196 ◦C show that the support has a BET surface area of 869 m2/g,
a mesopore surface area of 97 m2/g and a micropore volume of
0.32 cm3/g. It was previously veriﬁed that the textural parame-
ters remained almost unchanged compared to the unloaded carbon
when higher metal loads were used in this same activated carbon
as a support [23]. Therefore, it is assumed that the textural proper-
ties of the supported metal catalysts are not signiﬁcantly different
from the original activated carbon.
3.1.2. TPR
The TPR proﬁles (not shown) of the monometallic catalysts show
peaks at 190 ◦C for Pd, 230 ◦C for Cu and 200 ◦C for Pt. The reduction
peak at around 60 ◦C relative to the decomposition of Pd -hydride
[31,39,40] was not observed, which may indicate that Pd is well
dispersed on the support [41]. The Pd–Cu catalyst showed a single
reduction peak at 150 ◦C that can be assigned to the reduction of
Cu oxides, promoted by the presence of the noble metal [32,39,41].
The decrease in the reduction temperature of supported copper in
bimetallic catalysts induced by the presence of palladium indicates
that a close proximity between copper and palladium species was
achieved [41]. The TPR proﬁle of the Pt–Cu catalyst is characterized
by two peaks at 200 ◦C and 400 ◦C. The ﬁrst one, located around
that of the pure platinum catalyst, indicates the reduction of mixed
Pt–Cu oxidized species where both metals are in close contact. The
peak at higher temperatures could be attributed to the reduction
of isolated copper species [6]. Supported CuO may be reduced at
higher temperatures depending on the particle size and its interac-
tion with the support [42]. It could be assumed that oxidized copper
particles in the bimetallic catalyst are well dispersed and interact
strongly with the support, which is the most probable explanation
for their reduction at higher temperature than the monometallic
copper particles [9].
3.1.3. TEM
TEM analyses were made in order to get information on the
particle size distribution for all samples. TEM images and the cor-
responding histograms of the particle size distributions (Figs. 1–3)
revealed that the average particle size depends on the calcina-
tion/reduction conditions. In both series (Pd–Cu and Pt–Cu), the
evolution of the particle size with the temperatures used during
calcination/reduction presents a similar trend (Figs. 1 and 3). No
major differences were observed in the morphology of the catalysts
neither calcined nor reduced; in fact, in this sample, no particles
can be detected (Fig. 3a), due to the fact that this catalyst was
not heat treated and, consequently, no metal particles were gener-
ated, or the particles have a diameter lower than 2 nm (detection
limit of the equipment used). For the catalysts TCal = 200 ◦C NRed
(Figs. 1a, 2 and 3b) only a few particles can be observed. In the
case of 1%Pd–0.3%Cu ACo TCal = 200 ◦C TRed = 100 ◦C (Fig. 1b) and
1%Pt–0.3%Cu ACo TCal = 200 ◦C TRed = 100 ◦C (Fig. 3c) it is already
possible to see a signiﬁcant number of well deﬁned particles. These
observations suggest that metals are well dispersed on the support.
From the particle size distributions it was observed that these cat-
alysts mainly present particle sizes between 3 nm and 4 nm and
only a few particles higher than 5 nm were detected in some of
them. For the 1%Pd–0.3%Cu ACo and 1%Pt–0.3%Cu ACo catalysts
with TCal = 200 ◦C TRed = 200 ◦C and TCal = 400 ◦C TRed = 400 ◦C, TEM
analyses show the presence of not only small particles in the range
of 5–6 nm, but also many larger particles (see Figs. 1c, 3d and e).
From the TEM micrographs it can be concluded that calcina-
tion and reduction at different temperatures lead to signiﬁcant
changes in the average particle size. As can be seen in the his-
tograms, an increase in the calcination and reduction temperatures
causes an increase in the particle size of the crystallites. These
results are in agreement with those reported by Gurrath et al.
[40] and Ramos et al. [43] for Pd supported on activated carbons.
These authors observed that reduction at higher temperatures orig-
inates a decrease in the dispersion, which should be attributed to
an increase in the metallic particle size due to the migration of par-
ticles and sintering during the calcination and reduction steps [43].
Sepúlveda-Escribano et al. [44] observed the same effect for Pt sup-
ported on carbon blacks. The increase of the particle size can also
be promoted by the thermal decomposition of the oxygenated sur-
face groups initially present on the activated carbon surface. With
the destruction of these groups, the ﬁxed small metal particles (or
the unreduced precursor) would become mobile on the surface and
consequently would agglomerate to larger particles [44,45].
3.1.4. CO adsorption microcalorimetry
This technique can give information about the energetic interac-
tion of CO with the different surface metals, which allows to assess
the heterogeneity of the surface and the interaction between met-
als. Since CO hardly adsorb on copper [46], only CO adsorption on
either Pt or Pd was considered. Small doses of CO were contacted
with the reduced catalysts and the differential heat of adsorption
was measured as a function of the CO coverage.
Fig. 4 shows the differential heat of CO adsorption at 25 ◦C
as a function of the coverage for the monometallic Pd and
1%Pd–0.3%Cu ACo catalysts after different calcination/reduction
treatments. For the monometallic catalyst, the initial heat is around
190 kJ/mol, and it strongly decreases with the CO coverage up to
40 mol/g, where a plateau was reached. The CO coverage was
similar in the 1%Pd–0.3%Cu ACo with TCal = 200 ◦C TRed = 100 ◦C;
therefore, Cu is not blocking the Pd sites where the CO is adsorbed.
Moreover, the heat of adsorption proﬁles is roughly the same in
both catalysts, so the energetic interaction of CO with Pd has not
changed with the addition of Cu.
Different results are obtained with the 1%Pd–0.3%Cu ACo cat-
alyst using TCal = 200 ◦C TRed = 200 ◦C. These changes in the proﬁle
show up important modiﬁcations in the Pd active sites by effect
of the reduction temperature. The initial heat of adsorption is now
99 kJ/mol, and slightly decreases with the CO coverage; further-
more, the amount of CO adsorbed has also decreased with respect
to its counterparts. The lower energetic interaction of CO with
Pd active sites suggests that Cu is modifying Pd. These effects
are even more clear after a calcination and reduction treatment
at high temperature (TCal = 400 ◦C TRed = 400 ◦C), where the lower
energetic interaction of CO with Pd is also accompanied by a drastic
decrease in the amount of CO adsorbed. Either the sintering of the
Pd nanoparticles and/or, more likely, the dilution of surface Pd by
Cu (large migration of Cu to surface positions after a high temper-
ature reduction treatment), with possible Pd–Cu alloy formation,
may account for the observed behaviour. Earlier investigations [47]
on the interaction of CO with Pd–Cu alloys have shown a decrease

in the CO interaction with the amount of Cu. Fernández-Garcia et
al. [48] and Anderson et al. [49] observed a decrease in the num-
ber of CO molecules bridging two or more Pd atoms, which are the
most energetic sites for CO adsorption [50], when Cu was added,
indicating a dilution of the surface Pd by Cu, which also correlates
with the loss in the adsorption capacity.
The heat of CO adsorption proﬁles for the Pt catalysts are plotted
in Fig. 5. The low CO adsorption capacity of this catalyst complicates
the analysis, since only few doses can be introduced. Neverthe-
less, the amount of CO adsorbed and the heat of adsorption on
the bimetallic 1%Pt–0.3%Cu ACo with TCal = 200 ◦C TRed = 200 ◦C is
lower than on the monometallic one in all the range of coverage.
This effect, as in the Pd–Cu catalyst, would be most likely due to the
formation of a Pt–Cu alloy. Copper in metallic state is diluting and
interacting with the surface Pt atoms, thus decreasing the number
of Pt active sites and their interaction with CO. Li et al. [51] found
analogous results on Pt–Cu catalysts supported on SiO2 for both, H2
and CO adsorption.

The XRD proﬁle of the support (ACo) shows two broad peaks
centered around 2 = 24◦and 44◦, which are due to turbostratic
carbon [52]. In 1%Pd–0.3%Cu ACo and 1%Pt–0.3%Cu ACo catalysts,
the XRD spectra do not show any intense peak corresponding to
the metals, which could be due to the low amount of metal loaded
and, on the other hand, could be taken as an indication of a good
metal dispersion on the support [31]. TEM observations support
this last conclusion. Only in the XRD spectra of the bimetallic cat-
alysts 1%Pd–0.3%Cu ACo and 1%Pt–0.3%Cu ACo with TCal = 400 ◦C
TRed = 400 ◦C signiﬁcant peaks corresponding to the metals can be
observed, this being indicative of the presence of larger particles
than when the catalysts are treated at lower temperatures, and is
in agreement with the TEM analyses. In addition, in these XRD spec-
tra it can be observed that the Pd and Pt peaks are slightly displaced
to the right, which is indicative of the formation of alloys [31,32],
as conﬁrmed by CO adsorption microcalorimetry.
3.1.6. XPS
Concerning the XPS characterization, the objective was to esti-
mate the relative abundance of the metals at the surface as a
function of the calcination and reduction treatments. The infor-
mation concerning their oxidation states must be considered with
reserve because these experiments were not carried out in situ,
therefore, some surface oxidation could result from the contact
with air during sample manipulation. Besides the characteriza-
tion by XPS of the fresh and the spent 1%Pd–0.3%Cu ACo catalyst
TCal = 200 ◦C NRed, an additional sample was prepared with the aim
to understand the inﬂuence of the initial 15 min contact between
the catalyst and hydrogen in water before starting reaction (addi-
tion of nitrate). The Pd 3d and Cu 2p spectra of the bimetallic
samples were analysed and the binding energies of the Pd 3d5/2
and Cu 2p3/2 levels are reported in Table 1. The surface Pd/Cu atomic
ratio, obtained by XPS, is also presented in Table 1.
Barrabés et al. [18] identiﬁed platinum, palladium and copper
supported on activated carbon in the reduced form for the fresh cat-
alysts, but for some of the used catalyst the metals were not only
in the reduced form but also in the oxidized form. According to the
TPR proﬁles, it was expected that the heat treated catalysts were in
the reduced form. However, in this work, the binding energies val-
ues found for copper and palladium are respectively characteristic
of Cu2+ [53,54] and Pd2+ [55,56], i.e. of the oxidized form. Proba-
bly, this is due to the contact with air after the calcination and/or
reduction and after reaction, which could oxidise the metals [39].
In addition, according to Yamamoto et al. [57], in the samples cal-
cined at 200 ◦C, the presence of copper prevents the reduction of
Pd2+ to Pd0 due to a preferential reduction of Cu2+ relatively to that
of Pd2+ on the reduction sites of activated carbon, due to the lower
redox potential of Cu2+ to Cu+ (0.15 V vs. Ag+/AgCl) than that of
Pd2+ to Pd0 (0.92 V). However, as can be seen in the next section,
the contact with reaction media can change the surface of the cat-
alysts, and although the metals are in the oxidized form they are
reduced in situ during the kinetic experiments, where the catalysts
are continuously in contact with hydrogen dissolved in water.
The increase in the Pd/Cu ratio with increasing of the reduction
temperature can be explained by Cu migration. Epron et al. [9] pro-
posed Cu migration during the reduction of Pt–Cu catalysts. The
migration was supposed to be towards the core of the bimetallic
particles, leading to a surface enrichment with platinum, but also
to a decrease in the amount of superﬁcial copper. Moreover, accord-
ing to Sá et al. [37], copper seems to migrate towards the support
with the increase of the reduction temperature. These suggestions
are consistent with our results.
Nevertheless, from the comparison between XPS results of the
fresh and the spent catalyst TCal = 200 ◦C NRed, signiﬁcant differ-
ences were observed in their surface composition after 15 min of
contact with hydrogen in water and after 5 h of reaction, where a
low Pd/Cu ratio is obtained. Considering that the measurements
of leached metals for this sample indicate that no palladium was
detected and that the amount of dissolved copper is very low, the
decrease of this ratio is not due to leaching of the metals. Yoshinaga
et al. [17] have also found that when activated carbon is used as a
support for this reaction the dissolved amounts of Pd and Cu were
negligibly small. Therefore, the results can only be explained by the
modiﬁcation of the copper and palladium relative distribution on
the catalyst surface. This surface modiﬁcation may be induced by
the contact with the reaction media, which allows an rearrange-
ment of the metal phases [9]. The decrease of the Pd/Cu ratio could
be due to the preferential migration of palladium towards the inte-
rior of the support [40] and/or the migration of copper to the surface
of palladium during reaction.
As can be seen in Table 1, the atomic ratio between Pd and Cu
obtained by XPS is lower than the theoretical (1.99). This is related
with the fact that XPS is a surface technique and then only gives an
estimative of the chemical composition of the uppermost surface
layers (about 10–15 nm in depth).
3.2. Catalytic tests
The effect of calcination and reduction temperatures on
the catalytic activity and selectivity during the reduction of
nitrates was studied. The activities of 1%Pd–0.3%Cu ACo and
1%Pt–0.3%Cu ACo catalysts are shown in Figs. 7a and 8a, respec-
tively. Figs. 7b, 8b, 7c and 8c show the corresponding evolution of
nitrite and ammonium concentrations during the reaction.
As can be seen in Figs. 7 and 8, the reduction of nitrates is
quite different depending on the supported metal and the cal-
cination/reduction conditions. In general, for the two catalysts,
the activity decreases by increasing the calcination and reduction
temperatures. This effect is more pronounced for the pair Pd–Cu.
For high calcination and reduction temperatures, the Pt–Cu cata-
lysts are more active than the Pd–Cu catalysts. However, using a
low reduction temperature or not carrying out the reduction step,
the Pd–Cu catalysts are the most active. The order of activity for
both catalysts is similar: TCal = 200 ◦C NRed > NCal NRed > TCal = 200 ◦C
TRed = 100 ◦C > TCal = 200 ◦C TRed = 200 ◦C > TCal = 400 ◦C TRed = 400 ◦C,
with nitrate conversion values after 5 h of 93%, 85%, 79%, 35% and
25%, and 77%, 73%, 64%, 57% and 53%, respectively for the Pd–Cu and
the Pt–Cu catalysts. For the 2%Pd–1%Cu ACo catalysts the results
are also similar; nevertheless, in this case, higher conversions are
obtained. For example, 100% nitrate conversions were achieved for
all the samples prepared at low temperatures (cf. Table 2), and
for the best catalyst (TCal = 200 ◦C NRed) before 200 min of reaction.

According to the TPR proﬁles, Pd–Cu and Pt–Cu bimetallic catalysts
are reduced at around 150 ◦C and 200 ◦C, respectively. So, it was
expected that the catalysts that have not been heat treated or have
been treated at low temperatures were, after preparation, in the
oxidized state. It is well assumed that the catalytic activity is related
with several factors such as metals dispersion, preparation condi-
tions, metals nature, type of support and, also, by the contact with
hydrogen in water. In the next section, it will be demonstrated that
the last factor plays an important role in the catalyst performance.
This contact will originate some in situ reduction of the noble metal.
Copper does not need to be in its reduced form in this catalytic
system [9]. Epron et al. [9] studied the inﬂuence of oxidizing and
reducing procedures on the activity of a Pt–Cu bimetallic catalyst
supported on alumina, and they also observed that the poorest
activity was achieved when the catalyst was oxidized and reduced
at 400 ◦C. They concluded that this lower activity results from the
destruction of the interactions between copper and platinum, and
a subsequent migration of copper towards the alumina support.
Therefore, a surface enrichment with platinum was noticed, which
eventually decreases the catalytic activity. In the present work, the
results obtained by XPS conﬁrm an increase of the Pd content on the
surface of the catalyst with the increase of calcination and reduction
temperatures.
The
nitrite
concentration
goes
through
a
maximum
(Figs. 7b and 8b) and the ammonium concentration increases
with the nitrate conversion (Figs. 7c and 8c), according to the
occurrence of consecutive/competitive reactions. The reduced cat-
alysts give rise to similar nitrite concentrations which, particularly
in the case of the Pt–Cu catalysts, are lower than the concentrations
obtained with the non-reduced catalysts. This can be explained by
the fact that for the catalysts only calcinated or not heat treated
the active sites for nitrite reduction are not completely formed.
As can be seen in the TEM micrographs, no or a limited number
of particles were observed for these catalysts, indicating a good
dispersion of the metals or, most probably, that the metal particles
are still not completely formed after preparation (especially for the
non heat treated sample). Therefore, in these conditions, the metal
could not be very active for nitrite reduction. It is well assumed
that nitrite reduction occurs principally on the monometallic sites
of the noble metal [1,22].
A similar trend is observed for ammonia, but in this case the
highest concentrations were measured for the Pd–Cu catalysts, cer-
tainly because the conversions attained with these catalysts are
higher than in the presence of the Pt–Cu catalysts.
Considering that these catalysts have the same amount of met-
als, the different performances should be related to the metal
dispersion and/or the nature of active sites. Calcination and reduc-
tion at high temperatures lead to a decrease of the nitrate
conversion in comparison with the catalysts treated at low tem-
peratures; this can be explained by the decrease of metal surface
area due to sintering and/or alloying. Preparation of the cata-
lysts at higher temperatures results in larger metal particles (see
Section 3.1.3). Additionally, it was observed by CO adsorption
microcalorimetry that heat treatments above 200 ◦C lead to the
formation of an alloy, thus decreasing the number of active sites
able to reduce nitrate. Batista et al. [39] and Deganello et al. [58]
observed similar performances for nitrate reduction using alloyed
or non-alloyed Pd–Cu. On the contrary, our results clearly show
that nitrate reduction is highly inﬂuenced by the preparation con-
ditions, being the formation of alloys a severe limitation for this
reaction. In order to obtain high activities, the metals must be in
close contact but not alloyed.
The 2%Pd–1%Cu ACo catalysts present nitrogen selectivities
slightly higher than the 1%Pd–0.3%Cu ACo catalysts. For the pairs
Pd–Cu and Pt–Cu the highest nitrogen selectivities were observed
for the catalysts TCal = 200 ◦C TRed = 200 ◦C, being the catalysts

the presence of 1%Pd–0.3%Cu ACo catalysts with and without pre-reduction in
water (CNO−
3 i = 100 mg/L, catalyst = 0.5 g/L, pH = 5.5, QH2 = 100 Ncm3/ min, QCO2 =
100 Ncm3/ min, T = 25 ◦C).
TCal = 400 ◦C TRed = 400 ◦C the most selective to ammonium. Never-
theless, for the Pt–Cu catalysts, the selectivities to nitrogen were not
too different from sample to sample. As can be seen in Table 2, the
catalysts corresponding to TCal = 400 ◦C TRed = 400 ◦C present differ-
ent nitrate conversions but similar high selectivities to ammonia.
According to Sá et al. [37], the decrease in the nitrogen selectivity
of the process with the increase of the reduction temperature, can
be attributed to alloying of the metals. Yoshinaga et al. [17] sug-
gested that a dilution of Pd takes place during alloying. This leads
to an increment in the number of isolated Pd atoms, which are sug-
gested to be active sites for the ammonium formation. In a recent
work [23] it was demonstrated that the selectivity to ammonium is
higher when the noble metal is isolated, because as the noble metal
is very active for hydrogenation reactions the nitrite ions are deeply
hydrogenated into ammonium. The pair Pd–Cu is more selective to
nitrogen than the pair Pt–Cu. According to this work, the calcination
temperature at 200 ◦C and reduction temperature at 100 ◦C have
been selected as the optimal temperatures for the catalysts activa-
tion, in order to achieve reasonable activities and high selectivities
to nitrogen. Higher temperatures led to substantial decrease in the
catalytic activity probably due to alloy formation and/or sintering,
and lower temperatures led to an increase in the catalytic activity
but with lower selectivity to nitrogen.
In addition to the metal dispersion, a support promoting effect
on the metals may also be considered, since activated carbon has a
reducing character, and the contact with hydrogen in water must be
considered as an important factor in the catalytic activity. To inves-
tigate the inﬂuence of passing a hydrogen ﬂow during 15 min before
the introduction of nitrates in water in the activity and in the oxi-
dation state of the catalyst, the catalytic reduction of nitrates was
performed under different conditions than that normally used. For
that purpose, the catalyst (sample 1%Pd–0.3%Cu ACo TCal = 200 ◦C
NRed) was only introduced in the reactor together with the concen-
trated nitrate solution, i.e. after 15 min of ﬂowing hydrogen. Fig. 9
presents the evolution of nitrate concentration in this experiment.
Fig. 9 shows the experiment without in situ pre-reduction. The
reaction only begins after a period of about 20 min, and a displace-
ment in the corresponding curve relative to that observed for the
experiment with pre-reduction was noticed. This induction period
can be explained by the time necessary to reduce the noble metal
in situ with hydrogen and, probably, the presence of hydrogen in
water allows a rearrangement of the metal phase, as it has been
previously reported by Epron et al. [9]. To conﬁrm this hypothe-

87
sis, a XPS analysis of the catalyst was carried out after being in
contact with hydrogen in water during 15 min. The XPS results (cf.
Table 1) lead to the conclusion that the contact with hydrogen in
water changes signiﬁcantly the surface composition of the catalyst.
A decrease of the metal surface ratio (Pd/Cu) is observed, probably
due to a palladium migration towards the support and/or a migra-
tion of copper to the top of palladium. The results obtained permit
to conclude that the noble metal can be reduced in situ by hydrogen
in the presence of activated carbon (avoiding the ex situ reducing
step).
An additional experiment was carried out to investigate the
inﬂuence of the contact with dissolved hydrogen in water; the cat-
alyst 1%Pd–0.3%Cu ACo NCal NRed was selected. After a ﬁrst typical
experiment, the catalyst was dried and used again under the same
experimental conditions. The results obtained (not shown) demon-
strated that in the second run the catalyst is initially more active
than in the ﬁrst experiment, but after 180 min the activity becomes
slightly lower. Additionally, it was observed that the selectivity to
nitrogen was similar in both experiments. Once again, these results
may be interpreted considering that the noble metal was reduced
in situ by hydrogen and, for that reason, the initial activity is higher
in the second test.
4. Conclusions
The results obtained in this work show that the reduction of
nitrate is quite different depending on the supported metal and
the preparation conditions. For the catalysts tested, the activity
decreases with the increase of calcination and reduction temper-
atures, whereas the effect on the selectivity is not uniform. The
calcination and reduction at high temperatures are inadequate
due to the formation of larger metal particles and/or alloys. The
contact with hydrogen in water has an important effect on the
catalytic activity. This contact allows an in situ reduction of the
noble metal. Taking into consideration the selectivity to nitrogen,
the performance of the catalysts is maximised at low calcination
and reduction temperatures. The calcination at 200 ◦C and reduc-
tion at 100 ◦C seem to be the optimal temperatures to activate the
catalysts, when both the activity and nitrogen selectivity are con-
sidered. For all the preparation conditions tested, the Pd–Cu pair is
more selective in the transformation of nitrate into nitrogen.
