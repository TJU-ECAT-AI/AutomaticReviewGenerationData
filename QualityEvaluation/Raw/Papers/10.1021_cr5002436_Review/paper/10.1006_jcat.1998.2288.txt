Quantum chemical calculations were performed using density
functional theory to study interactions of C1 and C2 hydrocarbons
with 10-atom Pt clusters. The heats of ethylene adsorption to form
di-σ- and π-adsorbed species were calculated to be −171 kJ/mol
and −103 kJ/mol, respectively, at 298 K. The calculated heat is
−109 kJ/mol for the formation of ethylidyne species from ethy-
lene adsorption, with the formation of gas phase dihydrogen at
298 K. The heat of adsorption of acetylene to form molecular, di-
σ/π-adsorbed species is −209 kJ/mol, and the heat of formation of
di-σ/π vinylidene species is −278 kJ/mol at 298 K. The calculated
structural parameters of these species agree with the available ex-
perimental data. The same 10-atom platinum cluster is used to cal-
culate the heats of adsorption of various other hydrocarbon species
which may be reactive intermediates for hydrocarbon conversion
reactions. These species include vinyl, methyl, ethyl, methylene,
ethylidene, and ethylylidene species.

INTRODUCTION
Rationale
Reactions of hydrocarbons on metal catalysts (e.g., Pt)
are of importance in the chemical and petrochemical in-
dustries (e.g., (1, 2)). Accordingly, signiﬁcant experimental
efforts have been made in the catalysis and surface science
communities to study the interactions of small hydrocar-
bons with various metal surfaces (e.g., (3, 4)). In addition,
theoretical methods involving electronic structure calcula-
tions have recently become viable tools for investigating
the chemistry of catalytic systems (e.g., (5–8)). The appli-
cation of these theoretical techniques requires calibration
of the method (level of theory, basis set, cluster size, and
shape) through the prediction of chemistry that has been
observed experimentally, such as heats of adsorption. The
results of these calibrated theoretical methods, combined

with experimental results, provide further insight into fac-
tors controlling catalyst performance.
In the present paper, we address possible reaction inter-
mediates involved in ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum.
This reaction has been studied by various authors (e.g.,
(9–12)), and the literature related to this reaction forms a
foundation for studies involving microcalorimetric, kinetic,
and quantum chemical studies of C2 species on platinum.
We begin our studies with the adsorption of ethylene and
acetylene on platinum. We will show that the experimen-
tally measured heats of interaction of these molecules with
platinum at various temperatures can be explained using
quantum chemical calculations, employing density func-
tional theory (DFT) for Pt10 clusters. These Pt10 clusters
are then used to estimate the energetics of various hydro-
carbon fragments postulated to be intermediates in the hy-
drogenolysis of ethane over platinum. Importantly, these
intermediates are difﬁcult to examine by common experi-
mental techniques, and one has to rely on theoretical cal-
culations to predict the structures and energetics of these
species. In a related paper, the heats of adsorption predicted
from quantum chemical studies are combined with kinetic
measurements to develop a quantitative kinetic description
of ethane hydrogenolysis over supported Pt catalysts (13).
Carter and Koel (14) published a table of energetics for
gas-phase C1 and C2 hydrocarbon species and the interac-
tion of these species with Pt(111). Similar to this present
paper, these investigators presented energetics of species
which could be determined experimentally (e.g., from TPD
results and data compiled by Benson (15)), and they pre-
sented an approximation scheme to estimate the energetics
of the species that have not been observed experimentally.
Literature
The interactions of ethylene with single crystal platinum
surfaces and supported platinum catalysts have been widely
studied, and the results of these investigations show distinct
surface species depending on temperature. For example, ul-
trahigh vacuum studies of ethylene adsorption on Pt(111)
have identiﬁed π-bonded ethylene species at temperatures

below 52 K (16), di-σ-bonded ethylene species from 100–
250 K (17–20), and ethylidyne species from 280–450 K
(17, 21, 22). Importantly, Sheppard and De La Cruz have
shown (23) that results comparable to those obtained
on single crystal metal surface are found when ethylene
is dosed onto supported platinum catalysts. For example,
infrared spectra show the presence of π-bonded and di-
σ-bonded species when ethylene is dosed onto silica-
and alumina-supported platinum at low temperatures
(<195 K), whereas ethylidyne species form at room tem-
perature (23).
Similar to ethylene adsorption on platinum at low tem-
peratures (<250 K), acetylene has been shown to adsorb
associatively with its C–C axis parallel to the platinum sur-
face (24). On a Pt(111) surface, acetylene is thought to
form two σ-bonds and one π-bond to three platinum atoms
(19, 24–26) in threefold hollow sites (26, 27). Acetylene
has been shown to adsorb associatively at higher temper-
atures (>280 K) with its C–C axis normal to the platinum
surface (18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 28, 29). Vinylidene species have
been suggested to be responsible for this type of adsorption
(18, 20, 21, 29–31); however, ethylidyne species (22, 28),
which form in the presence of surface hydrogen (18, 19, 22,
24, 25, 29, 32–34), and di-σ/π-vinylidene species (19, 32)
have also been proposed to form.
The strengths with which the aforementioned species in-
teract with platinum have been probed with microcalorime-
try. For example, Dumesic and co-workers (35–38) have
used heat-ﬂux microcalorimetry to measure the heat of
ethylene and acetylene adsorption on supported platinum
catalysts and platinum powder, and King and co-workers
(39–41) have used ultrahigh vacuum microcalorimetry to
measure the heat of ethylene adsorption on platinum single
crystals.Thesestudieswereperformedonplatinumsurfaces
at temperatures near 300 K, where ethylene adsorbs disso-
ciatively to form ethylidyne species and surface hydrogen.
METHODS
In the present investigation, the interactions of C1 and
C2 species with a platinum cluster containing 10 atoms
were studied using DFT methods. Such DFT methods have
proven to be useful to predict accurate geometries and rea-
sonable energetics for molecules containing transition met-
als (5, 42–45). The currently available DFT methods use
few semi-empirical parameters in conjunction with more
advanced functionals to give an adequate description of
nonlocal effects in electron exchange and correlation inter-
actions.
The DFT calculations were carried out using DEC work-
stations, with PS-GVB software (Schrodinger, Inc.) (46).
Thissoftwareusesapseudo-spectralmethodtoevaluatethe
various integrals. It combines both a basis set and a physical
space grid, thus retaining the speed of discrete methods and
the smoothing properties of continuous functions. The cho-
sen DFT method uses a hybrid method employing Becke’s
three-parameters approach, B3LYP (47). This functional
combines the exact HF exchange, Slater’s local exchange
functional, Becke’s 1988 nonlocal gradient correction to
the exchange functional, with the correlation functionals of
Vosko–Wilk–Nusair (VWN) and Lee–Yang–Parr (LYP).
The basis set employed in all calculations (LACVP∗∗)
uses an effective core potential on all Pt atoms, developed
at Los Alamos National Laboratory by Hay and Wadt (48).
TheelectronstreatedexplicitlyonPtaretheoutermostcore
and valence electrons (5s2 5p6 5d9 6s1), with the remaining
core electrons treated with effective core potentials which
account for mass-velocity and relativistic effects. The inclu-
sion of outermost core electrons with the valence electrons
is necessary because these core orbitals have similar sizes
as the valence orbitals. Use of pseudo-potentials to replace
the outermost core electrons leads to quantitatively differ-
ent results, as will be shown later in this paper. The C and
H atoms have been treated with the 6-31G∗∗basis set (49),
with all electrons being treated explicitly.
Electronic energies were calculated for all clusters by
conducting full geometry optimizations. The Pt-Pt bond
distances in these geometry optimizations were not con-
strained, since relaxation and adsorption-induced recon-
struction effects are common for small particles (50–52).
The electronic energies calculated after geometry opti-
mizations were corrected for basis set superposition error
(BSSE) using Boys–Bernardi counterpoise calculations for
all adsorbate/cluster models (53). This correction is ∼10–
12 kJ/mol per bond between the adsorbate and the cluster.
The
change
in
electronic
energy
for
adsorption
(1Eelectronic) is deﬁned as
1Eelectronic = Ecluster/adsorbate −(Ecluster + Eadsorbate),
where Ecluster/adsorbate is the electronic energy of the adsor-
bate on the cluster, Ecluster is the electronic energy of the
bare cluster (Pt10), and Eadsorbate is the electronic energy of
the gas-phase adsorbate (C2H4, C2H2, etc.).
Calculated heats of adsorption at higher temperature
facilitate comparison with the experimentally measured
values and also can be used for estimation of kinetic param-
eters for ethane hydrogenolysis on platinum catalysts. Ac-
cordingly, frequency calculations were performed to com-
pute zero-point vibration and enthalpy corrections and the
heats of adsorption were estimated at 298 K and 623 K. As
an approximation, we assume that the vibrational frequen-
cies of the surface adsorbate are the same as those of the
corresponding gas phase radical to calculate the enthalpy
and zero-point energy corrections. The heat of adsorption
(1Hads(T)) to form a particular surface species at temper-
ature T is thus estimated by
1Hads(T ) = 1Eelectronic + 1ZPE + 1H(T )enthalpy corrections,
186
WATWE ET AL.
where 1ZPE and 1H(T)enthalpy corrections are the changes in
zero-point energies and enthalpy corrections for the cor-
responding gas-phase reaction of radical species. In this
correction we assume that the thermal energy loss from
reduction of translational and rotational modes upon ad-
sorption is compensated by the thermal energy acquisition
from increased vibrational modes attributed to frustrated
translation and rotation of the adsorbate on the cluster.
RESULTS/DISCUSSION

Dissociation energy of PtCH2

Information about the
accuracy of the present theoretical calculations may be in-
ferredbyinvestigatingthedissociationenergyofthePtCH+
2
complex cation. The reported experimental value for the
dissociation of this cation is 479.5 kJ/mol ± 4.2 kJ/mol (54).
The value for this dissociation energy is calculated to be
504.2 kJ/mol, using the B3LYP functional, the LACVP∗∗
basis set, and correcting for changes in zero-point ener-
gies. This comparision shows that the DFT method predicts
overbinding between the transition metal and the adsor-
bate, but this difference is in general agreement with the
accuracy limit of 20 kJ/mol suggested by van Santen and
Neurock (5) for DFT cluster calculations.
Pt10 cluster.
The Pt10 cluster used in this study has
10 atoms arranged into three layers resembling (111)
planes, as shown in Fig. 1. This cluster has threefold, two-
fold, and atop adsorption sites. The Pt-Pt distances in the
optimized cluster range from 2.56 to 2.88 ˚
A, with an aver-
age value of 2.72 ˚
A. The distance in bulk Pt metal is 2.77 ˚
A.
The atoms in the center of the four faces are slightly puck-
ered out from the center of the cluster. This cluster has been
described in detail elsewhere (55).
Boyanov and Morrison have studied the structures of
platinum clusters containing 10–25 atoms on Y zeolite,
using X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS) and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (56). They report the average
interatomic distance to be 2.70 ˚
A, and they conclude that
this bond contraction of 0.07 ˚
A compared to bulk Pt is
intrinsic to the cluster with no effect from zeolite support.

Koningsberger and co-workers report from EXAFS mea-
surements that the interatomic distance is 2.74 ˚
A for a
cluster of 4–5 Pt atoms with coordination number of 3.7 in
L-zeolite (57). Sachtler and co-workers have reported a
value of 2.64 ˚
A for platinum particles with average co-
ordination number of 7.7 (58). The results from these ex-
perimental studies are in agreement with the predictions
from the present study that the average Pt-Pt distance of
2.72 ˚
A in Pt10 clusters is shorter than the value of 2.77 ˚
A in
bulk Pt metal.
Gas-phase species.
Table 1 shows the zero-point ener-
gies and enthalpy corrections for the gas-phase compounds
and the gas-phase radicals corresponding to the adsorbates
of this present investigation. This table also lists the spin
multiplicities for the different gas-phase species.
Optimization of the geometry of gaseous ethylene gives
C-C and C-H bond lengths of 1.33 and 1.09 ˚
A, respectively,
and the H-C-H angle is 116◦. These values are in agreement
with the experimental values of 1.34 ˚
A, 1.09 ˚
A, and 117.8◦,
respectively. The calculated C-C and C-H bond lengths for
gaseous acetylene are 1.20 and 1.07 ˚
A, and the H-C-C angle
is 180◦. The corresponding experimental values are 1.20 ˚
A,
1.06 ˚
A, and 180◦.
Ethylene-Pt10.
Various theoretical studies have ad-
dressed the chemisorption of ethylene on platinum (8, 21,
59, 60). The optimized geometry for di-σ-ethylene (µ2, η2-
ethene) is shown in Fig. 2. The calculated C-C bond length
for this species is 1.50 ˚
A, in agreement with experimental
values (1.48–1.52 ˚
A) (61, 62). The calculated value of the
C-C bond length is close to the C-C bond length in ethane
(1.54 ˚
A) and considerably longer than that in ethylene
(1.34
˚
A), indicating rehybridization of the C-C bond

from sp2 to sp3. This rehybridization has been seen ex-
perimentally on Pt(111) at low temperatures (23, 24). The
calculated heat of ethylene adsorption to form this di-σ-
adsorbed species is −171 kJ/mol at 298 K. Results from
recent LEED studies of ethylene adsorbed on Pt(111)
suggest that the C-C axis is tilted with respect to the surface
plane by about 22◦(63). We do not observe this geometry
for the di-σ-adsorbed species.
Ethylene adsorption on atop sites can also lead to π-
adsorbed species (η2-ethene), and Fig. 3 shows two types of
π-adsorption that were found on the Pt10 cluster. The ﬁrst
π-adsorbed species has the C-C axis of ethylene oriented
parallel to the edge of the platinum cluster (Fig. 3a), while
the second species has the C-C axis oriented perpendicular
to the edge (Fig. 3b). The C-C bond length is 1.41 ˚
A for
both structures, in agreement with NEXAFS results which
give a value of 1.41 ˚
A (64).
The calculated heat of ethylene adsorption at 298 K to
form the ﬁrst type of π-adsorbed species is −103 kJ/mol,
and the heat for the second species is −137 kJ/mol. It has
been shown experimentally that ethylene forms π-adsor-
bed species on the (110) and (210) surfaces of Pt, for which

the surface atoms have coordination numbers of 7 and 6, re-
spectively (65, 66). A theoretical study by Paul and Sautet
showed that the π-adsorbed species is more stable than
the di-σ-adsorbed species for coordination numbers lower
than or equal to 7 (67). In the present study the coordina-
tion number of the Pt atoms on which ethylene is adsorbed
is 6.
For more densely packed surfaces, such as Pt(111), it has
been shown that the di-σ-adsorbed species is more stable
than the π-adsorbed species. Ethylene adsorbs as π-bonded
species at low temperature and rehybridizes at tempera-
tures above 52 K into di-σ species on Pt(111) (16, 21, 28).
The ﬁrst type of π-adsorbed species (with the C-C axis ori-
ented parallel to the edge of the cluster) may be a bet-
ter representation of π-adsorbed species on such a densely
packed surface, and the heat associated with this ﬁrst type
of π-adsorbed species is considerably lower than the value
for the di-σ-adsorbed species. In another theoretical study
using semi-empirical theory, the di-σ-adsorbed species was
found to be more stable than π-adsorbed species on Pt(111)
by50kJ/mol,whichagreeswiththedifferenceinthepresent
study of 46 kJ/mol (68).
Table 2 compares the heats of adsorption of ethylene cal-
culated in the present study to the experimentally measured
heats of adsorption on platinum (35, 39). Microcalorimet-
ric results for ethylene adsorption on platinum powders at
173 K show a heat of −120 kJ/mol (35). Studies of ethy-
lene adsorption on Pt at temperatures between 100 and
270 K have shown that ethylene adsorbs associatively as
a combination of di-σ-adsorbed and π-adsorbed species
(23, 24). Recently, similar initial heats of adsorption were
observed for ethylene adsorption on silica-supported plat-
inum at temperatures lower than 200 K (69). Low tem-
perature infrared spectroscopic investigations of this same
Pt/SiO2 catalyst showed that these observed heats may, in
fact, be attributed to the formation of di-σ- and π-adsorbed
ethylene species (69). Importantly, the observed heat of

−120 kJ/mol suggests that adsorption of ethylene on plat-
inum at 173 K is a nonequilibrated process. Accordingly, the
observed heat of −120 kJ/mol reported by Spiewak et al.
can be attributed to the average heat for the formation of
a combination of di-σ- and π-adsorbed species (35). King
and coworkers have reported a heat of ethylene adsorption
equal to −136 kJ/mol to form di-σ-adsorbed species and
a value of −120 kJ/mol to form π-adsorbed species on a
Pt(110)(2 × 1) surface at room temperature (39).
Ethylidyne-Pt10.
Studies of the interactions of ethylene
with Pt(111) at temperatures above 280 K indicate that
ethylene adsorbs dissociatively and rearranges such that
its C-C axis is oriented normal to the surface (23). The re-
sulting ethylidyne species forms bonds with three surface
atoms. The ethylidyne (µ3-ethylidyne) species prefers the
threefold FCC hollow site on platinum. Our calculations for
the adsorbed ethylidyne species, shown in Fig. 4, give a C-C
bond length of 1.52 ˚
A and C-Pt bond lengths of 1.98 ˚
A. The
hydrogen atoms point towards the bridge positions on the
Pt cluster (Fig. 4a). This geometry agrees with results from
LEED reported by Somorjai and co-workers (22), which
indicate a C-C length of 1.50 ± 0.05 ˚
A and Pt-C lengths of
2.00 ± 0.05 ˚
A.
The heat of adsorption of ethylene to form ethylidyne
species and gas phase dihydrogen is calculated to be
−127 kJ/mol at 298 K. Another conﬁguration of ethylidyne
species with hydrogen atoms pointing towards the atop po-
sitions of the platinum cluster (Fig. 4b) gives a heat of ad-
sorption of −117 kJ/mol (see Table 3). The small energy
difference (10 kJ/mol) between the two structures suggests
that rotation of the methyl group about C-C axis may be
facile. This prediction agrees with the absence of hydrogen-
related features in LEED data at 90 K (70).
Table 2 compares theoretical and experimental heats
to form ethylidyne and gas-phase dihydrogen from the

adsorption of ethylene on platinum at room temperature.
Studies of ethylene adsorption on Pt near room temper-
ature have shown that ethylene adsorbs dissociatively to
form ethylidyne species and atomic adsorbed hydrogen
(23, 24). King and coworkers reported a heat of −170 kJ/
mol for adsorption of ethylene on Pt(110)(2 × 1) (39) while
the microcalorimetric results for ethylene interaction with
platinum powder at 303 K give a heat of −160 kJ/mol (35).
Since the heat of adsorption of H2 on Pt may be taken to be
−90 kJ/mol (37, 71), the observed heats reported by King
and coworkers and Spiewak et al., correspond to values of
−125 kJ/mol and −115 kJ/mol, respectively, for the forma-
tion of ethylidyne species on Pt and gaseous dihydrogen.
These experimental values are in good agreement with the
DFT result that predicts the heat of formation of ethyli-
dyne species and gas phase dihydrogen to be −127 kJ/mol
at 298 K (see Table 2).
The lower heat observed by Spiewak et al. (35) may be
the result of nonequilibrated adsorption of ethylene on Pt
powder at 303 K, and this reported heat corresponds to an

integral heat of adsorption. Since surface diffusion allows
equilibrated adsorption of ethylene on a single crystal
surface, the observed heat of King and co-workers is more
representative for the formation of ethylidyne species on
Pt (39).
Acetylene-Pt10.
Acetylene adsorption on various sur-
faces has been studied by different theoretical techniques,
including extended Huckel theory (72, 73). Molecularly
adsorbed acetylene prefers a high coordination triangular
site (27), and the molecular geometry resulting from our
DFT calculations is shown in Fig. 5a. The calculated C-C
bond length is 1.41 ˚
A, indicating rehybridization from sp
towards sp3 hybridization. This calculated bond length is
in agreement with the experimental value of 1.35 ˚

in agreement with the experimental values of 120–132◦

acetylene adsorption is −209 kJ/mol to form the molec-
ularly adsorbed species shown in Fig. 5a. The measured
heat of acetylene adsorption on Pt powder at 173 K
is equal to −210 kJ/mol (35), as shown in Table 2. At

tion on Pt10 clusters: (a) di-σ/π-adsorbed acetylene, (b) di-σ/π vinylidene

temperatures lower than 250 K, acetylene has been
shown to adsorb molecularly with its C-C axis oriented
parallel to the platinum surface (23). On a Pt(111) sur-
face, acetylene adsorbs preferentially in threefold hollow
sites and forms two σ-bonds and one π-bond to three
platinum atoms. Therefore, the measured heat of −210 kJ/
mol is most likely related to formation of the di-σ/π-
acetylene (µ3, η2-ethyne) species on a threefold platinum
site.
At temperatures higher than ∼280 K, acetylene has been
shown to adsorb with its C-C axis tilted away from the plat-
inum surface. Different species such as vinylidene, ethyli-
dyne, and di-σ/π-vinylidene have been proposed to form.
Figure 5b shows the optimized geometry of a CCH2 species
on Pt10, oriented with its C-C axis aligned at an angle to
the surface. This species represents a di-σ/π-vinylidene spe-
cies (µ3, η2-vinylidene) with both hydrogen atoms on a
single carbon atom. The Pt-C bond lengths involved in
σ-bonding are 1.92 ˚
A, while the Pt-C bond length involved
in π-bonding is 2.00 ˚
A. The C-C bond length is calculated to
be 1.44 ˚
A, indicating rehybridization towards sp3 hybridiza-
tion. NMR studies of acetylene adsorption on small plat-
inum particles at room temperature have shown existence
of CCH2 (77%) and HCCH (23%) species; and, the C-C
bond length of the CCH2 species was determined to be
1.44 ˚
A (32), in agreement with our calculated value. The
calculated heat of acetylene adsorption to form this species
is −278 kJ/mol at 298 K (see Table 3).
We have attempted to calculate the energetics of µ2-
vinylidene species on Pt, for which the C-C double bond
is retained (i.e., corresponding to a C-C bond length of
1.34 ˚
A). A constrained optimization was thus carried out
with the C-C bond length ﬁxed at 1.34 ˚
A. This procedure
resulted in a species similar to that in Fig. 5b, and the heat
of adsorption for this species from acetylene was calculated
to be −262 kJ/mol. Hence, we ﬁnd that the CCH2 species
in Fig. 5b is the most stable among the acetylene isomers.
Figure 5c shows a π-bonded form of acetylene (η2-
ethyne) adsorbed on an atop site of the Pt10 cluster. The
C-C bond length is 1.25 ˚
A and the heat of adsorption of this
species is calculated to be −88 kJ/mol. Hence, our calcula-
tions predict the existence of a weakly adsorbed, π-bonded
acetylene species, even though to the best of our knowledge
there is no experimental evidence for such a species.
King and co-workers have reported an initial heat of
−205 kJ/mol for ethylene adsorption on Pt(110)(2 × 1) at
room temperature (39). These investigators attributed this
heat to the formation of a di-σ/π vinylidene species on the
platinum surface. This reported heat from ethylene adsorp-
tioncorrespondstoaheatof−290kJ/molfortheadsorption

Effects of cluster approach.
It is recognized that there
are limitations of the cluster approach employed in the
theoretical calculations. The primary assumption behind
this approach is that chemisorption is a local phenomenon
which is primarily affected by the nearby structure. Accord-
ingly, the predicted properties will be affected by the spin
state, cluster size and shape, orientation of the adsorbate on
thecluster,aswellastheleveloftheoryandchosenbasisset.
We have used the singlet electronic conﬁguration of the
Pt10 cluster to calculate the heats of adsorption of various
species reported in this paper. A recent DFT study (75) re-
ported that the ground state for a similar Pt10 cluster was
a nonet (i.e., multiplicity of 9). We also ﬁnd that the nonet
electronicstateismorestablethanthesingletby116kJ/mol.
The most stable electronic conﬁguration became a singlet,
however, when an oxygen atom was adsorbed on the Pt10
cluster (75). Since most practical platinum catalysts are sup-
ported on oxide surfaces, it is probable that the singlet state
may be more appropriate to use in DFT calculations to
model reactions on supported Pt catalysts. We have also
carried out DFT calculations on larger Pt clusters, contain-
ing 14 and 23 Pt atoms. The most stable electronic state is a
pentet for the Pt14 cluster, and it is a singlet for the Pt23 clus-
ter. The ground state for bulk platinum should be a singlet,
since this metal is not magnetic.
The existing literature has guided our search for the ad-
sorption sites and the orientation of the adsorbate on these
sites. Adsorption sites were limited to the central six atoms
of the Pt cluster (coordination number of 6). Adsorption on
the four corner atoms in the cluster were not considered,
since their coordination number is 3 and may have different
electronic density.
The Pt-Pt bond distances were not constrained for the
Pt10 cluster, since relaxation and adsorption-induced recon-
structioneffectsarecommonforsmallparticles(50–52).We
have studied the adsorption of some key species on the un-
relaxed Pt10 cluster with Pt-Pt bond lengths maintained at
2.77 ˚
A. It was observed that the predicted heats of adsorp-
tion of ethylidyne, di-σ-adsorbed ethylene, and π-adsorbed
ethylene were more exothermic on the unrelaxed cluster by
46, 6, and 24 kJ/mol, respectively.
We have investigated the effect of using a smaller basis
set on the predicted energetics for our DFT calculations in-
volving Pt10 clusters. In particular, we used the LAV3P basis
set to study the formation of ethylidyne species and di-σ/π-
adsorbed acetylene species. This smaller basis set uses a
pseudo-potential to replace all core electrons of Pt atoms,
including the outermost core electrons, leaving Pt with 10
electrons that are treated explicitly. The 6–31G∗∗basis set
is retained on all C and H atoms. The calculated heat of
formation of ethylidyne species from ethylene adsorption
withevolutionofgaseousdihydrogenis−50kJ/mol,andthe
heat of adsorption of acetylene to give the di-σ/π-adsorbed
species is −155 kJ/mol. These values are signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent from the values of −127 kJ/mol and −209 kJ/mol,
respectively, obtained by including the outermost core elec-
trons explicitly in the calculations.
Hydrocarbon fragments-Pt10.
In the previous sections
we have compared the results from DFT calculations
with experimental results for various well-deﬁned surface
species that are formed during the adsorption of ethylene
and acetylene on platinum. Since we have found that DFT
calculations using Pt10 clusters give reasonable geometries
and energies for these surface species where extensive ex-
perimental data are available, we now use DFT calcula-
tions on Pt10 clusters to model hydrocarbon fragments on
platinum for which detailed experimental data are not yet
available. As noted earlier, this approach is employed to
provide estimates for various reaction intermediates that
may be involved in ethane hydrogenolysis on Pt.
Figure 6a–c shows optimized geometries for CH, CH2,
and CH3 fragments on the Pt10 cluster, respectively. We ﬁnd
that CH, CH2, and CH3 species prefer the threefold hollow
site, twofold bridge site, and onefold atop site, respectively.
It appears that carbon binds at a site that preserves its

tetrahedral geometry and saturates its coordination. This
observation is in agreement with previous theoretical stud-
ies using extended Huckel theory and discrete variational
Xα theory (76). The Pt-C distances in adsorbed CH, CH2,
and CH3 species are 1.95, 2.01, and 2.05 ˚
A, respectively. The
C-H bond lengths in all species are 1.09 ˚
A, and the HCH
angles are near 110◦, indicating a tetrahedral structure for
all species. The calculated heats of methane adsorption with
evolution of gas phase dihydrogen are given in Table 3 . The
energies of these CHn species are in agreement with results
from earlier theoretical studies (68, 77). The geometrical
parameters, such as bond lengths, calculated in the present
DFT study should be more accurate than those obtained in
previously reported extended Huckel theory calculations,
which are known to give inaccurate bond lengths.
Ethane may adsorb dissociatively on platinum to form
adsorbed ethyl species and adsorbed hydrogen. The op-
timized geometry of an ethyl species on Pt10 is shown in
Fig. 6d. This species adsorbs on an atop site, similar to
a methyl group. The ethyl species is similar to gas phase
ethane, i.e., the C-C and C-H bond lengths are 1.52 and
1.1 ˚
A,respectively,andtheHCCangleis109◦.ThePt-Cdist-
ance is 2.06 ˚
A, which is longer than the distances in CHn
species.
Other possible reactive intermediate are vinyl species,
CHCH2. Two conﬁgurations for these species are shown
in Fig. 7. In the ﬁrst isomer (Fig. 7a), the vinyl species is
adsorbed on an atop site, as reported in an earlier theo-
retical study. This species is similar to gas phase ethylene,
with a C-C bond length of 1.34 ˚
A and a CCH angle of 120◦.
The Pt-C distance is 1.98 ˚
A. The second isomer (Fig. 7b)
for the vinyl species is more stable, and it is located on
a threefold site. This vinyl species (µ3, η2-vinyl) has rehy-
bridized to sp3 hybridization, e.g., the C-C bond length is
1.50 ˚
A. The Pt-C bond lengths for this species, associated
with three platinum atoms, are 2.03–2.06 ˚
A. The calculated

heats of formation of these species from ethylene are shown
in Table 3.
Another species that may form on Pt is the ethylidene
species, CHCH3 (µ2-ethylidene). This species has been pos-
tulated to be an intermediate for the formation of ethyli-
dyne species (CCH3) on the Pt(111) surface. The optimized
geometry for ethylidene species on the Pt10 cluster is shown
in Fig. 8. The calculated heat of C2H4 adsorption to form
ethylidene species is −87 kJ/mol. The calculated C-C bond
length is 1.51 ˚
A.
Application of Results for Ethane Hydrogenolysis
The results from the DFT calculations of the present
study provide information about the energetics for vari-
ous hydrocarbon fragments that may be involved in ethane
hydrogenolysis on platinum. Importantly, this energetic in-
formation can be used to constrain the parameters that are
used in kinetic models, based on elementary steps, to ﬁt re-
action kinetics data. In most kinetic models that have been
used in this respect for ethane hydrogenolysis on Pt (11, 78),
the adsorption of ethane is generally assumed to be quasi-
equilibrated, leading to the formation of an adsorbed C2Hx
species which undergoes the rate-determining cleavage of
the C-C bond. The quasi-equilibrated formation of this de-
hydrogenated C2Hx species can be written as

more endothermic and the standard entropy change be-
comes more positive as more hydrogen atoms are removed
from ethane. Accordingly, the formation of more highly
dehydrogenated C2Hx species is favored with increasing
temperature. This information is critical for estimating the
surface coverages by different hydrocarbon species dur-
ing the ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum, as shown
elsewhere (13). For example, di-σ/π-adsorbed vinylidene
species, CCH2, are predicted to be the most abundant sur-
face species on Pt at typical reaction conditions for ethane
hydrogenolysis, e.g., a temperature of 623 K for ethane and
hydrogen pressures of 0.02 and 0.2 atm, respectively. Ta-
ble 4 shows the relative coverages of other C2Hx species
compared to the CCH2 coverage.
CONCLUSIONS
It is recognized that there are limitations of the cluster ap-
proach employed in theoretical calculations. Accordingly,
microcalorimetric and spectroscopic results were applied
to calibrate the theoretical methods by comparing results
for observable, stable surface intermediates. Such a cali-
bration establishes the appropriate geometry (e.g., cluster
shape and size) and method (e.g., level of theory and basis
set) to adequately described the desired chemistry.
The results from DFT calculations using 10-atom plat-
inum clusters give structural and energetic information
that generally agree with experimental data for various C2
species on platinum. These comparisons have been made
for di-σ-adsorbed ethylene, π-adsorbed ethylene, ethyli-
dyne species (CCH3), di-σ/π-adsorbed vinylidene species
(CCH2), and di-σ/π-adsorbed acetylene species. In general,
the calculated heats of adsorption are within 20 kJ/mol of
experimental values measured microcalorimetrically, and
the calculated structural parameters are within several per-
cent of experimentally values. This general agreement be-
tween experimental and theoretical results shown in Table 2
suggests that the present theoretical methods applied to a
10-atom platinum reasonably predict the interactions of C2
hydrocarbon with platinum. Accordingly, these DFT calcu-
lations on Pt10 clusters were extended to predict the heats
of interaction of various intermediates on Pt, including CH,
CH2, CH3, C2H5, CHCH3, and CHCH2 species. The ener-
getics for the formation of these species may be used as ini-
tial estimates in developing kinetic models for hydrocarbon
conversion reactions on Pt, such as ethane hydrogenolysis.
