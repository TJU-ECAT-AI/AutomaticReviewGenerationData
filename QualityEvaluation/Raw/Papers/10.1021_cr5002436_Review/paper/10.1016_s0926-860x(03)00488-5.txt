Abstract
Incorporation of gallium and iron into MCM-41-type silicas leads to creation of active and selective catalysts for the
dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. This catalysts demonstrate remarkable stability with time on stream and do not suffer
from repeated reaction–reoxidation cycles. Ga-MCM-41 is particularly efﬁcient for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
At 550 ◦C isobutane is converted into a mixture of C2–C4 oleﬁns containing 52% of isobutene, which corresponds to 32%
of the equilibrium conversion into isobutene at this temperature. Fe-MCM-41 shows the best performance for ethylbenzene
dehydrogenation into styrene, in particular, at 600 ◦C, the yield over this catalyst is 38% per pass and selectivity is 82%,
which corresponds to 64% of the equilibrium value. The catalysts have been characterised by XRD, volumetry, infrared
spectroscopy, ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). Catalytic
activity is associated with the presence of nanoparticles of oxides, entrapped in the pores or embedded in the silica network,
which generate reducible species able to split C–H bonds and allow fast recombinative desorption of hydrogen and oleﬁns.

1. Introduction
Early catalytic applications of mesostructured alu-
minosilicates synthesized using micelles of surfac-
tants as templates have been focused on acid catalysis.
Due to their high surface area, the presence of large
pores uniformly distributed and surface acidity—
generated by substitution of Si for Al in the frame-
work—MCM-41-type aluminosilicates have raised

the expectation of an extension of the application
ﬁeld of zeolites. Not only they were expected to allow
the processing of molecules, which were too large to
penetrate the small zeolite micropores but also un-
restricted diffusion of products was likely to prevent
catalyst deactivation by fouling. These expectations
proved correct in a number of reactions, such as gas
oil hydrotreatment [1], butene and propene oligomeri-
sation [2,3] Friedel–Crafts alkylation and acylations,
acetalyzation, Beckman rearrangements or glycosida-
tion [4–6]. Several reviews on catalytic applications of
mesostructured materials are available [7–10]. They
clearly emphasise the potential of these materials as

acid catalysts, although it is not always clear whether
mesostructured materials bring advantages compared
to more traditional amorphous silica aluminas.
Extending the paradigms of zeolite science to
micelle-templated silicas (MTS), a series of trivalent
elements have been inserted in the MTS frameworks
to regulate and control acidity. Among them, Ga and
Fe could be easily incorporated into the silicon net-
work using synthesis procedures in neutral, alkaline
or acidic media [11–19]. Spectroscopic and catalytic
studies conﬁrmed the isomorphous substitution and
the materials demonstrated the same sequence of
Brönsted acid strength as in zeolites: Al > Ga ≫Fe
[15].
However, the amorphous silica framework of MTS
materials is highly ﬂexible [20] and guest trivalent
heteroelements are easily extracted upon calcination.
During the process of thermal extraction, the Fe or Ga
atoms migrate onto the surface and/or agglomerate as
nanoparticles of oxide, embedded in the silica matrix
or entrapped in pores [15,16,18,20,21].
The objective of this contribution has been to inves-
tigate the properties of MCM-41-type materials con-
taining immobilized Ga and Fe oxide nanoparticles.
Scarcely studied, the catalytic properties of gallium
and gallium oxides supported on aluminosilicates have
received attention some 20 years ago owing to their
activity in alkane dehydroaromatisation [23,24]. Inter-
est for gallium oxides has been renewed recently on
account of their remarkable promoting inﬂuence for
carbon dioxide hydrogenation into methanol [25,26].
On the other hand, the catalytic properties of promoted
and unpromoted iron oxides are well documented, be-
cause of their dehydrogenation activity and practical
use, for instance in styrene production [27]. On the ba-
sis of these considerations, we considered of interest to
probe the catalytic behaviour of Fe- and Ga-containing
MCM-41 in ethylbenzene and isobutene dehydrogena-
tion. We report here our preliminary promising results.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Si-MTS and Al, Ga and Fe substituted materi-
als have been synthesised at 50 ◦C, at near neutral
pH values [11,18], using the following reagents:
tetraethoxysilane
(TEOS,
purum
98%,
Aldrich),
ammonium ﬂuoride (NH4F, purum > 99%, Carlo
Erba), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMABr,
Aldrich), aluminium nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O, RPE >
99%, Carlo Erba), iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O,
purum > 98%, Aldrich), gallium nitrate (Ga(NO3)3,
purum 99.9%, Sigma) and distilled water. The com-
position of the reacting gels was: CTMABr/SiO2 =
0.21, NH4F/SiO2
=
4.1, H2O/SiO2
=
146.5,
Al/SiO2 = 0.01 and Fe (Ga)/SiO2 = 0.05. In a typ-
ical synthesis 191.4 g of distilled water were heated
at the temperature of 50 ◦C, then 5.48 g of CTMABr,
10.99 g of NH4F and the appropriate amount of triva-
lent element nitrate were carefully added, in this
order, until full dissolution of each ingredient. Fi-
nally, 15.09 g of TEOS were added. The gel was
maintained at 50 ◦C for 4 h. The solid formed was
ﬁltered, washed with distiled water then with ethanol
and dried at 110 ◦C for 2 h. Calcination to remove the
surfactant template was achieved at 550 ◦C in a ﬂow
of dry air. The temperature was raised at a rate of
2◦min−1 and maintained for 6–24 h.
2.2. Characterisation methods
Chemical composition was determined by atomic
absorption after dissolution of the solids.
X-ray diffraction powder patterns were acquired
on a Philips PW 1730 difractometer using Cu K
radiation.
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were
recorded using a Micromeritics Asap 2010 instru-
ment. Mesopore volumes were determined from the
amount adsorbed at the end of capillary condensation.
Surface area was obtained by BET linearization in
the pressure range 0.05–0.2p/p0.
Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of am-
monia was performed in a home-made set-up equipped
with condustivity detector using samples submitted to
template decomposition at 550 ◦C in air for 24 h. Prior
to NH3 adsorption, the samples were calcined in situ in
a ﬂow of dry air at 550 ◦C for 1 h, and subsequently, in
a ﬂow of dry nitrogen for 1 h and then cooled down to
ambient temperature. The NH3 adsorption was carried
out for 30 min at room temperature in a ﬂow of NH3
diluted with N2 (1/1). Subsequently, the physisorbed
NH3 was removed in a ﬂow of dry He at 60 ◦C for
30 min. Typical TPD experiments were carried out in
N.S. Nesterenko et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 254 (2003) 261–272
263
the temperature range of 25–750 ◦C in a ﬂow of dry
He (30 ml/min). The rate of heating was 8◦min−1.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) under
hydrogen was performed on samples activated for 24 h
at 500 ◦C, in a home-made set-up equipped with TC
detector. Typical TPR experiment was carried out in
the temperature range of 20–1000 ◦C in highly diluted
hydrogen ﬂow (30 ml/min, Ar + 3.5 mol% H2). High
purity Ar, additionally puriﬁed with Ni-Cr catalyst,
CaA zeolite and MnO2/Al2O3 was used as carrier gas.
The rate of heating was 10◦min−1. The apparatus was
calibrated using two loop-shaped sampling devices
with known volumes and weighted amounts of NiO.
Thermogravimetry has been used to dose the carbon
content on the catalysts after reaction. Experiments
have been performed with a TG-DSC 111 instrument
(Setaram), using He or air as purge gas.
Infrared spectra of lattice vibrations were recorded
with a Nicolet Protégé 460-FTIR spectrometer by
using the KBr wafer technique. Infrared spectra
of the region of OH and CO vibrations have been
recorded using a IFS-28 FTIR Bruker instrument
on self-supported wafers of samples placed in a
home-made cell connected to a volumetric line and
allowing thermal treatments up to 700 ◦C [18,20].
2.3. Catalytic testing
Conversion of isobutane and ethylbenzene was
studied in two different continuous ﬂow catalytic
units at atmospheric pressure in the temperature range
of 500–600 ◦C and weight hourly space velocity
(WHSV) of 0.2–1.2 h−1.
2.4. Ethylbenzene experiments
In a typical experiment, 1.5 g of catalyst (0.5–1 mm
grain size) were placed into a ﬁxed-bed quartz reac-
tor between two layers of quartz grains (0.25–3 mm
grains). The catalyst pre-treatment included heating
in a ﬂow of dry nitrogen at the reaction temperature
for 0.5–2 h. After pre-treatment, ethylbenzene was fed
in by a syringe pump (Bioblock). Ethylbenzene was
diluted with Ar (Ar/EB molar ratio = 2.5/1). The
vapour from the reactor was cooled successively in
cold water and ice traps. The liquid was weighted on
a balance. The analysis of liquid and gaseous products
was carried out by gas chtromatography. A 25 m long
Carbowax 20 M capillary column was used for the
analysis of liquids while a column ﬁlled with Porapak
Q (3 m) was used for gases. Material balances, exclud-
ing hydrogen which could not be accurately measured,
were calculated for all of the experiments. The overall
weights of liquid and gaseous products fell usually
within 100 ± 5% of the weight of starting materials.
2.5. Isobutane experiments
In a typical experiment, 0.5 g of catalyst (0.5–1 mm
grain size) was placed into a ﬁxed-bed quartz reac-
tor between two layers of quartz grains (0.25–3 mm
grains). The catalyst pre-treatment included heating
in a ﬂow of dry He at the reaction temperature for
0.5–2 h. After catalyst pre-treatment, isobutane di-
luted with He (isobutane/He molar ratio = 1/10) was
fed into the reactor through mass ﬂow controllers. The
gaseous reaction products were analysed on-line on
capillary column with KCl/AlCL3 (Plot, 30 m) using
GC. The set-up did not allow for on-line analysis of
liquids. The latter (aromatics) were collected in a cold
trap and analysed periodically using the Carbowax
20 M column. Their amounts (wt.%) were calcu-
lated as [(weight of aromatics collected within period
t)/(weight of isobutane fed during the same period)]
× 100. Again materials balances within 100 ± 5%
were achieved.
Catalyst regeneration was carried out before each
experiment, even if no catalyst decay was observed
during preceeding experiment. The regeneration pro-
cedure included heating in a ﬂow of dry air for 6 h at
550 ◦C. The system was then purged in the ﬂow of in-
ert gas as described earlier. All catalytic data reported
below refer to experiments performed on catalysts re-
generated at least ﬁve times.
Total conversion was calculated as:
X =
 niCi
nRCR +  niCi
× 100
where Ci and CR are the molar concentrations of prod-
uct i and reactant R, respectively, and ni and nR the
number of carbon atoms in the product i and reac-
tant R, respectively. Selectivity to product i (in mol
or wt.%) was calculated from the percentage of this
product in the reactant free efﬂuent. Yields per pass
(in wt.%) were deﬁned as the following ratio: [weight
of target product (styrene or isobutene)]/[total weight

of products and reactant] × 100. Equilibrium compo-
sitions were calculated from the data reported in [28].

acteristic type IV isotherm with a sharp adsorption
step in the range of relative pressure corresponding to
condensation in pores of ca. 4 nm in size. The XRD
patterns presented a strong broad signal centered at
2θ = 2.05◦(Ga- and Fe-MTS, d100 = 4.97 nm) or
2.1◦(Si- and Al-MTS, d100 = 4.85 nm). Higher or-
der diffraction lines in the range of 2θ = 3–5◦(re-
ﬂections 110 and 200) were still detected, although
not so well resolved as in the as-synthesized solids.
Increasing the calcination time to 24 h and repeated
reaction–regeneration cyles (see later) did not affect
the textural characteristics of the four materials. These
features conclusively show that the ordered hexagonal

265
arrangement of uniform mesopores is preserved after
the thermal treatments. This observation is in line with
the results reported in literature on the thermal stabil-
ity of MCM-41 materials, prepared under near neu-
tral pH. These synthesis conditions have been shown
to produce MCM-41-type materials with pore walls
thicker than 1 nm [11], which confers excellent ther-
mal and mechanical stability to the mesoporous silica
network [29,30].
3.1.2. State of trivalent elements in activated solids
The infrared spectra of lattice vibrations of the sam-
ples calcined for 24 h at 550 ◦C show the features typ-
ical for amorphous silicas with main absorption bands
at ca. 1220, 1070–1090, 800 and 455 cm−1, due to
the anti-symmetric and symmetric stretching modes
of T–O–T lattice units and to deformation modes of
TO4 tetrahedra, respectively. Substitution of Si for Al,
Ga and Fe leads to a shift of the anti-symmetric vi-
bration of the T–O–T units towards lower wavenum-
bers (1064–1074 cm−1) in the as-synthesized samples
(Fig. 2a [15]). However, after the thermal treatments,
such an evidence for isomorphous substitution is no
longer apparent, as exampliﬁed for Ga-MTS in Fig. 2.
Actually, after activation in air of the as-synthesized
material for 8 or 24 h at 550 ◦C in order to decom-
pose the template (Fig. 2e and b, respectively) the po-
sition of the anti-symmetric T–O–T vibration shifted
from 1074 to 1088 cm−1, a value corresponding to
Fig. 2. Infrared spectra of lattice vibrations for Ga-MTS: (a) as-synthesised material; (b) after calcination for 24 h in air; (c) after catalytic
reaction; (d) after oxidative treatment at 550 ◦C in air; and (e) as-synthesised material calcined for 8 h in air.
that observed for a purely siliceous material. Addi-
tional tretaments under reductive (Fig. 2c) or oxidative
(Fig. 2d) atmospheres had no inﬂuence on the position
of the various signals. It can be therefore concluded,
in agreement with previous studies, that after template
removal by calcination, most, if not all, of the trivalent
element has been extracted from the silica network.
Direct characterization of the extra lattice iron and
gallium oxide phases generated by calcination proved
very difﬁcult on account of their small size and dilution
in the silica matrix. XRD and TEM analyses did not
allow to detect any particles in the samples, indicating
that the latter must be amorphous and/or smaller in
size than 4 nm. Similarly, UV-Vis, NMR, Mössbauer
and EPR studies of Fe-MTS materials by us and others
[15,16,21] failed, to date, to provide clear and reliable
information on the state and nature of the occluded
species on the calcined solids.
The surface properties of the various MTS materials
and the fate of Al, Ga and Fe upon thermal treatments
have been therefore investigated by indirect methods
involving interaction with different probes such as in-
frared spectroscopy of CO adsortion, TPD of ammo-
nia and TPR in hydrogen.
Details of the results obtained by infrared spec-
trsocopy using CO as a probe have been reported
elsewhere [18,20] and will be only summarized here.
Regardless of the calcination temperature, in the range
500–700 ◦C, the infrared spectra in the region of OH
266
N.S. Nesterenko et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 254 (2003) 261–272
vibrations feature a main signal at 3745 (±3) cm−1
characteristic of internal and external silanol groups.
The signal is dissymmetric and extends on the low
frequency side indicating the presence of interacting
OH groups with diverse environments, as observed in
amorphous silicas. Only in the case of Ga-MTS addi-
tional weak signals were detected in this region. A ﬁrst
one, centered at 3662 cm−1 has been attributed to OH
stretchings of non-bridged gallium sites in the lattice.
It is observable after calcination at 500 ◦C but vanishes
after calcination at 700 ◦C where a new band cen-
tered at 3780 cm−1 develops assigned to free Ga-OH
groups on the surface of gallium oxide particles. Both
signals are weak but their relative evolution upon
increasing calcination temperature strongly supports
the migration of gallium atoms and their agglomera-
tion in tiny oxide particles. The CO molecule used as
surface probe showed these materials very different
from isomorphously substituted zeolites as no signal
could be attributed to interactions with Brönsted sites
generated by trivalent atoms at bridging framework
positions. The acidity thus evidenced was essentially
of Lewis type with a moderate strength and origi-
nates from extra-lattice oxide particles. In the case of
Al-MTS some weak “hidden” framework Brönsted
sites could be revealed upon addition of small doses
of water, as discussed in a previous contribution [20].
An additional insight into the acidic properties
of the catalysts was gained from the ammonia TPD
Fig. 3. Ammonia TPD proﬁles (heating rate 8◦min−1) for (a) Ga-MTS, (b) Al-MTS, (c) Fe-MTS and (d) Si-MTS.
experiments reported in Fig. 3. Owing to the low
density and moderate strength of the sites the samples
were ﬂushed with nitrogen after ammonia adsorp-
tion at a low temperature, 60 ◦C, before the TPD
measurements. This means a signiﬁcant contribu-
tion of physisorption in the measurements, which
can be evaluated however from the proﬁle obtained
on Si-MTS which may be used as blank reference.
With this restriction in mind, it appears that most
of the ammonia desorbs at a temperature lower than
200 ◦C, with a maximum in the rate of desorption
at a temperature only slightly above that of Si-MTS.
The TPD proﬁles for the Ga-, Fe- and Al-containing
samples are nevertheless tailing towards the high tem-
perature side indicating the presence of a small but
deﬁnite amount of strong adsorption sites on these
materials. Moreover, in spite of identical contents of
trivalent element, the total amount of ammonia dosed
on Ga-MTS (0.49 mmol/g) largely overpasses that
retained on Fe-MTS (0.12 mmol/g). If one accepts
the hypothesis put forward above that adsorption oc-
curs mostly on extra lattice species, this differences
indicates a much higher degree of dispersion of the
gallium oxide particles.
The TPR curves obtained for Fe-MTS (Fig. 4) re-
vealed two main events occurring at 420 and 600 ◦C
plus a small shoulder at an intermediate temperature
of ca. 500 ◦C. The hydrogen consumption associ-
ated to the whole signal corresponded to a ratio

H2/Fe = 0.48 which is equivalent, within experimen-
tal error, to a complete reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II).
The shape of the TPR peak suggests moreover the
existence of at least three different iron species, with
different reactivity or accessibility. The presence of
various iron(III) species reducible at different tem-
peratures in calcined Fe-MCM-41 has been already
reported [16,22], though their exact nature and size
remains obscure.
The TPR proﬁle of Ga-MTS showed two zones of
hydrogen consumption, a low temperature small sig-
nal spreading over the range 400–600 ◦C and a more
intense one, consisting of several components, with
a maximum at 870 ◦C. The total hydrogen consump-
tion measured in the TPR experiment corresponds to
a ratio H2/Ga = 0.40. The nature of the active forms
of gallium responsible for the dehydroaromatisation
activity of Ga-ZSM-5 zeolites has been the matter
of intense debate. Several species, namely GaOx ox-
ides and Ga(I) or GaHx monomeric species have been
hypothesized [31–35]. Recent XPS and FTIR studies
on the reduction of silica-supported gallium(III) oxide
conclude to the reduction of Ga3+ cations into Gaδ+
(δ < 2) upon heating in hydrogen above 450 ◦C [36].
These Gaδ+ species are able to split molecular hydro-
gen, generating Gaδ+–H and Ga–OH bonds. The co-
existence of oxidised (Ga3+) and reduced (Ga+ and
even Ga0) forms of gallium has been also claimed
on H-Ga-ZSM-5 zeolites activated at 700 ◦C under
vacuum [37]. If we assume similar behaviours for
Ga-MTS, the TPR results would suggest a reduction
of 40% of Ga(III) to Ga(I) in our case.
3.2. Dehydrogenation of isobutane
The activity of the four catalysts was compared for
the conversion of isobutane at 550 ◦C, with a helium
to hydrocarbon ratio of 10 and a WHSV of 0.33 h−1.
The results, reported in Table 2, point to a remark-
able behaviour of Ga-MTS. The conversion of isobu-
tane amounted to 45% and reaction products consisted
essentially in butenes and lower oleﬁns (85.5 mol%)
with low amounts of aromatics (1.5 wt.%). Such a dis-
tribution of products suggests a dual functionality of
the catalyst: a dehydrogenation activity, related to the
presence of dispersed gallium oxide nanoparticles, and
an isomerisation and cracking activity associated with

the presence of acid sites. It is apparent moreover that
under the experimental conditions the two functions
are far from being balanced. Actually the low levels
of cracking and aromatization reached at this reaction
temperature indicate that the dehydrogenation func-
tion dominates and determines the catalytic activity of
this material.
The other catalysts demonstrated a very low activ-
ity (Table 2) but unique characteristics as exampliﬁed
by the data reported in Table 3, where the selectivities
obtained over the four materials at nearly identical
conversion levels are compared. Si-MTS proved inac-
tive. The conversion level needed for the comparison
with the other catalysts was only attained at a tempera-
ture and a space velocity comparable to the conditions
in which the feed was converted without any catalyst.
The product distribution obtained over Al-MTS was
characteristic of thermal reactions plus some contri-
bution of isomerisation of isobutene to n-butene. This
low activity is fully in line with the absence of strong
acid sites as commented above. Fe-MTS featured an
intermediate behaviour in the sense that the contribu-
tions of acid and thermal reactions were lower than
on Al-MTS and Si-MTS, respectively, while dehydro-
genation to isobutene became the main event. Again
such a behaviour can be related to the main charac-
teristics of the sample, namely, the absence of surface
acidity and the presence of iron oxide clusters generat-
ing a low dehydrogenation activity. The highest selec-
tivity to dehydrogenation was obtained on Ga-MTS.

initially calcined in air at 550 ◦C for (a) 8 h, (b) 14 h and (c) 24 h.
Therefore, the catalytic properties of Ga-MTS were
investigated over catalysts prepared from different
synthesis batches and calcined under different condi-
tions. The inﬂuence of reaction conditions was also
studied on this catalyst. Most pertinent results are
reported in Fig. 5 and Table 4. The study revealed a
dramatic inﬂuence of the time of sample calcination
on its catalytic activity (Fig. 5). After calcination for
8 or 14 h, the catalysts showed moderate activity,
which increased slightly as a function of calcination
time and time on stream. Calcination for 24 h, or
longer (see later), led to the most active catalysts. The
conversion decreased slightly during the ﬁrst 2–3 h on
stream, then reached a steady value. Analysis of coke
on the catalysts recovered after 3–4 h runs showed
very small amounts of carbon in all cases (<1 wt.%)
indicating that the changes in initial activity and sta-
bility were probably not related to different coking
behaviours but rather to a better efﬁciency of template
removal upon increasing calcination time or to some
modiﬁcations in the nature of the gallium-containing
species dislodged from the lattice.
The inﬂuence of the reaction conditions is reported
in Table 4. As it can be seen from the changes in
selectivity, increasing reaction temperature or contact
time favoured the acid catalysed reactions—cracking,
isomerisation, aromatisation—at the expense of dehy-
drogenation.
Yields of aromatics (not included in the table as they
were not analysed on-line) amounted to 1–1.5, 2–3
and 7–10 wt.% at 500, 550 and 600 ◦C, respectively.

WHSV of 0.33 h−1. The yield of isobutene per pass
was of 26%, selectivity to isobutene was 52%, while
approach to equilibrium conversion was 32%; the
remaining products consisted mostly in n-butenes,
propylene and ethylene.
3.3. Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene—a less de-
manding dehydrogenation reaction which can proceed
by a simple gas-phase process [38]—was investigated
over the four catalysts at 600 ◦C, WHSV = 0.7 h−1
and ethylbenzene/Ar ratio of 1/2.5. Results are given
in Table 5. Out of the four catalysts, Ga-MTS and
Fe-MTS led to a signiﬁcant production of styrene
with high (>80%) selectivity. The other products
formed resulted from dealkylation reactions. Under
the above conditions, the yields of styrene per pass
corresponded to nearly 40% of the equilibrium con-
version. As expected, Si-MTS showed almost no
activity, whereas the products formed, and the mod-
erate activity with respect to the reaction temperature
obtained over Al-MTS where typical of the acid catal-
ysed dealkylation of ethylbenzene over a material
with weak acid strength.
A series of additional experiments was performed
over Fe-MTS and Ga-MTS in order to determine the
optimal reaction conditions for styrene production.
The details of the results obtained on Fe-MTS are
shown in Table 6. The catalyst showed appreciable
activity at a temperature as low as 500 ◦C with an
approach to equilibrium of 30% and a very high se-
lectivity independent of contact time. Increase of the
reaction temperature enhanced conversion, but at the
expense of selectivity as it is generally the case. The
highest styrene yield of 37.7% per pass, was obtained
at 600 ◦C with a space velocity of 0.2 h−1. Under these
conditions, the selectivity to styrene was 82% and the
conversion amounted to 64% of the equilibrium value.

The catalyst proved very stable (see later) under all
sets of experimental conditions investigated.
In the case of Ga-MTS, the optimal performances
in terms of styrene formation are those reported in
Table 4 and correspond to 36% of the equilibrium
conversion.
3.4. Stability of the catalysts
One of the main problems with dehydrogenation
catalysts is deactivation. Among other effects, the
severe experimental conditions at which they are op-
erated promote the generation of coke, both on the
support and the metallic or oxide phase, and the seg-
regation of the active phases. Both phenomena are the
main cause for deactivation. Although the catalytic
systems under investigation here are far from being
optimized, a series of experiments were designed in
order to evaluate their stability as a function of time
on stream and with regards to repeated regeneration
cycles. These studies revealed promising behaviours
for Fe-MTS and Ga-MTS, which will deﬁnitely call
for deeper investigation of these systems.
A typical time on stream dependence of the con-
version and selectivity of Fe-MTS for ethylbenzene
dehydrogenation is shown in Fig. 6. Actually, no no-
ticeable deactivation was detected and the amount of
coke deposited after 4 h on stream amounted to less
than 1 wt.%. In addition, after each catalytic test (4 h
on stream), in spite of the absence or low level of
deactivation, the catalyst was systematically submit-
ted to a calcination in ﬂowing air at 550 ◦C for 6 h
and re-evaluated under given conditions. The result
of such a study is shown in Fig. 7 which reveals that,
after an initial loss of activity suffered during the
ﬁrst 10–20 reaction–regeneration cycles, the activity
remained stable after 50 additional cycles.
Ga-MTS demonstrated good stability with time on
stream on typical experiments lasting 4–6 h. How-
ever, successive reaction–regeneration cycles revealed
a change in activity and selectivity as illustrated in
Fig. 8. Interestingly, such an irreversible ageing leads
to a better, more selective, dehydrogenation catalyst,
at least after a series of six to eight regeneration cy-
cles. Actually, the yield of butenes obtained on these
regenerated (reoxidised) catalysts (conversion times
selectivity) is equal to that formed on the freshly
activated samples. The lower overall conversion is

compensated therefore by a lower contribution of
the consecutive acid catalysed pathways. Since both
acidity and dehydrogenation activity are related to
the presence of nanoparticles of gallium oxide these
results suggest evolution of the active species under
reaction and regeneration conditions.
4. Conclusions
Calcination of MCM-41-type silicas in which some
of the tetrahedral atoms have been isomorphously
substituted by gallium or iron produces active and
selective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of hydro-
carbons. In addition, in spite of the presence of weak
acid sites of Lewis type, the catalysts demonstrate
a remarkable stability and low coking tendency as a
function of time on stream, which is rather unique in
this type of application. The catalytic activity is more
probably associated with the presence of nanoparti-
cles of the metal oxides, which generate reducible
species able to split C–H bonds and allow fast re-
combinative desorption of hydrogen. This property,
together with the low pore diffusional resistance af-
fecting reactants and products, prevent secondary
condensation reactions to occur, limiting thus fouling
by coke and deactivation. Further improvement of
these catalytic systems will deﬁnitely require better
identiﬁcation and eventually promotion of the active
phases. From the information gained in this work,
it appears that active sites are generated by aggre-
gation of a rather limited number of trivalent ions
disconnected from the lattice by thermal treatment.
The elucidation of the nature and size of these aggre-
gates as well as their formation process constitutes
a challenging task. Related work [17] on ethylben-
zene dehydrogenation using Fe-MCM-41 catalysts
activated under milder conditions than the ones used
here revealed only marginal activity, which increased
nevertheless slightly after oxidative regeneration. The
inﬂuence of the mesotructured silica lattice guest and

of the activation conditions on the construction of
efﬁcient catalysts is under investigation.
