Abstract
The dehydrogenation of alkanes over supported chromium oxide catalysts in the absence of oxygen is of high interest for
the industrial production of propene and isobutene. In this review, a critical overview is given of the current knowledge
nowadays available about chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, in particularly the industrially used Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.
It will be shown that detailed information on the dehydrogenation site can be obtained by using advanced spectroscopic tools.

Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has a
considerable industrial impact, because it represents
a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost
saturated hydrocarbons [1]. In the 1970±1980s, the
main interest was devoted to the catalytic dehydro-
genation of n-butane to butene and butadiene, which
are precursor molecules for manufacturing synthetic
rubber [2]. Nowadays, however, the dehydrogenation
of propane and isobutane has become more important.
Propene is used in the polymer industry for the
synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, whereas iso-
butene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and
ETBE, additives to gasoline. The reknown CATO-
FIN1 process leads the world for producing propene
and isobutene with an installed capacity of 600 000
and 2 600 000 metric tons per year, respectively. It is
estimated that 25% of the worldwide production of
MTBE originates from the catalytic dehydrogenation
of isobutane. This number is expected to increase in
the future because the traditional sources of isobutene,
i.e. steam cracking and FCC, are already heavily used,
and the availability of isobutene has become a bottle-
neck in the expansion of the MTBE market.
Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process,
and requires relatively high temperatures and low
pressures to obtain signi®cant yields of alkenes [3].
Because all equivalent C±H bonds in an alkane mole-
cule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogena-
tion reaction is expected to be rather unselective.
Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor
thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke.
As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to
possess good activity and selectivity, but also must
suppress thermal cracking reactions.

oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-
known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as
the commercial catalyst of choice. The main result
concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s
are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mclver
[6], and by Kearby [7]. Subsequently, numerous
papers have been published in the literature on
CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts
[8±50]. All the newer studies primarily focus on (a)
identi®cation of the active sites; (b) in¯uence of
preparation and treatment conditions on chromium
oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selec-
tivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation
mechanism.
In this review, a critical overview is given of the
current knowledge about chromium-based dehydro-
genation catalysts, in particularly the industrially used
Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. In Section 2, the thermodynami-
cal constraints for alkane dehydrogenations and their
technological consequences will be introduced. Sec-
tions 3 and 4 are devoted to the synthesis and spectro-
scopic characterization, while Section 5 discusses the
factors governing the catalytic activity and selectivity.
In Section 6, the spectroscopic and catalytic data of
Cr-based catalysts will be combined in an attempt to
de®ne structure±activity/selectivity relationships.

Thermodynamical constraints for alkane
dehydrogenations and their technological
consequences
Dehydrogenation reactions, CnH2n2$CnH2nH2,
are strongly endothermic, and the conversion per pass
is limited by thermodynamical equilibrium [51]. The-
oretical dehydrogenation equilibria for alkanes to
alkenes indicate that longer chains are dehydroge-
nated at lower temperatures, whereas lighter alkanes
require higher dehydrogenation temperatures. This is
illustrated in Table 1 for several linear and branched
alkanes [3]. The table summarizes the reaction tem-
peratures at which a certain conversion of the alkane
towards the corresponding alkene can be obtained. For
example, an equilibrium conversion of 50% is reached
under atmospheric pressure at around 5858C and
7258C for n-hexane (to n-hexene) and ethane (to
ethene), respectively. In addition, trans-2-butene for-
mation requires about the same temperature as 1-
butene formation, whereas cis-2-butene is formed only
at higher temperatures. Conversions can also be
increased by using lower pressures or by using dilu-
ents with the alkane feed.
Dehydrogenation reactions are rather unselective,
because all equivalent C±H bonds have an equal
bonding energy, and therefore an equal chance of
reacting [3]. When two C±H bonds of neighbouring
carbons are split, a double bond is formed and alkanes
are converted to alkenes. However, when the two C±H
bonds belong to non-neighboring carbon atoms, dehy-
drocyclization and possibly also aromatization may
occur. The latter reaction is especially pronounced for
alkanes with carbon chains of at least six carbons.
Thermodynamics show that aromatization equilibria
overtake dehydrogenation equilibria at higher tem-
peratures. Thus, n-hexane is primarily converted to
benzene, whereas toluene can be made from n-hep-
tane. If the two C±H bonds are part of two different
alkane molecules, higher molecular-weight hydrocar-
bons are formed, and extensive C±H bond breaking
and C±C bond formation may lead to hydrogen gas
and coke. Thus, to achieve an acceptable activity and
selectivity per pass, the catalyst needs to be periodi-
cally regenerated by burning the coke deposited on the
surface. It is also clear that degradation reactions

result in more hydrogen being produced than alkene,
and that a proper choice of feed rate and temperature
are needed to achieve an optimum industrial dehy-
drogenation process that has the required selectivity.
Since the discovery of Cr-based dehydrogenation
catalysts by Frey and Huppke [4,5], several industrial
companies have done extensive research to develop a
commercial dehydrogenation process. The main tech-
nological problems, within the constraint to operate as
a continuous process; are (1) suf®cient heat supply to
the reactor; (2) careful temperature control to mini-
mize degradation products and to maximize conver-
sion and (3) catalyst regeneration. Different solutions
have been developed, depending on the know-how of
the various companies. The best known processes are
the CATOFIN1 (for alkenes), the CATADIENE1 (for
dienes), the LINDEBASF1 the UOP1 and the
SNAMPROGETTI-YARSINTEZ1 processes. How-
ever, it is important to stress here that the LINDE1
process has only been used on a demonstration plant,
and has never been really commercialized.
In all these industrial processes, the heat obtained
from the burning of coke is used in the dehydrogena-
tion step. In the worldwide CATOFIN1 process,
licensed by UCI-ABB Lummus Global, series of
adiabatic ®xed bed reactors are in cyclic operation
with quickly alternating dehydrogenating and regen-
eration periods. In contrast, the ¯uidized bed SNAM-
PROGETTI-YARSINTEZ1 process uses a ¯uidized
bed reactor, and a regenerator interconnected with
each other. The latter process is mainly used in Russia,
and the industrial plants are of relatively small capa-
city. Details of these processes and reactor designs can
be found in several interesting papers [52±55].

Catalyst synthesis
Commercial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts
are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed
on a porous support including dopants to regulate
deactivation and improve selectivity. The Cr loading
is mostly around 13 wt% Cr [56], but dehydrogenation
activity has been observed in the entire range between
0 and 20 wt% Cr. Although alumina with a surface
area of 50±300 m2/g is the preferred support for
industrial applications, other supports such as zirco-
nia, silica and magnesium oxide have also been stu-
died in great detail [7]. Alumina possess the undesired
feature of catalyzing degradation reactions, i.e. crack-
ing and coking, leading to catalyst deactivation. To
overcome these problems, the responsible acid sites
are often poisoned with an alkali ion dopant, mostly
potassium, in a concentration up to 2 wt%. In this
respect, zirconia has some advantages over alumina,
because of its high thermal stability and low surface
acidity. Indeed, De Rossi et al. [44,45] have found
even higher dehydrogenation activities for Cr/ZrO2
catalysts.
The initial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalyst of
Frey and Huppke was prepared by coprecipitation of
aluminium and chromium nitrates with ammonium
hydroxide, but numerous modi®ed preparation proce-
dures have since been developed [6,7]. Many of these
preparation methods, mostly differing in their Cr
content and type of alkali metal ion, have appeared
in the patent literature. Generally speaking, Cr/Al2O3
catalysts can be prepared by three techniques:
1. Impregnation procedures in which a chromium
salt is deposited on an alumina support from a
suitable solvent and then decomposed to the
chromium oxides. Most frequently, supported
chromium oxide catalysts are prepared by an
incipient wetness impregnation of a porous high-
surface area alumina with an aqueous solution
containing chromium (VI) trioxide or chromium
(III) nitrate. If an alkali ion, such as potassium, is
needed, an aqueous solution containing K2CrO4 is
used.
2. Coprecipitation procedures in which chromium
and aluminium species are more or less simulta-
neously precipitated, dried, and calcined.
3. Atomic layer epitaxy procedures in which a chro-
mium salt, such as Cr(acac)3, reacts with the
alumina surface from the vapor phase. This alter-
native preparation method was recently reported by
Kytokivi et al. [43].

Catalyst characterization
Numerous papers have been published in the lit-
erature regarding the characterization of chromium
oxides supported on different inorganic oxides, and
much research has dealt with the use of a speci®c
spectroscopic technique, such as electron spin reso-

spectroscopy (DRS) [13,14,24,25,35,36], infrared
spectroscopy (IR) [38,44], and Raman spectroscopy
(RS) [16±23,31±33]. An overview of this ®eld, and the
potential and limitation of each characterization tech-
nique has been recently given in another review paper
(1). As a consequence, we will limit our discussion
here to a detailed discussion of the structure of (a)
freshly prepared, (b) catalytically active, and (c)
deactivated Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.
4.1.
Freshly prepared catalysts
The surface composition of calcined Cr/Al2O3 cat-
alysts as a function of the Cr oxide loading is sum-
marized in Table 2. The table shows three distinct Cr
loading regions, their exact limits are a function of the
preparation method, coupled with the surface area of
the alumina support. It is important to notice that the
reported surface composition in Table 2 refers to fully
dehydrated catalysts.
At low Cr oxide loadings, typically lower than
1 wt%, only Cr6 and Cr5 are detected. However,
XPS only detects Cr6, whereas DRS and RS are
able to discriminate between chromate and polychro-
mate (dichromate, trichromate, etc.) [1]. However, at
these low loadings, monochromate is the dominant
species [24]. This species strongly interacts with the
alumina support via its most basic hydroxyl groups,
and cannot be removed by rinsing the catalyst with
cold water [39]. In addition to Cr6, some Cr5 is
detected by EPR. This Cr5 is in square pyramidal
coordination, and represents only a small fraction of
the surface, typically less than 3% of the total Cr
content [30].
At
intermediate
Cr
oxide
loadings,
typically
between 1 wt% and monolayer coverage loading, both
Cr6/5 and Cr3 are detected, and the amount of
Cr6/5 decreases as a percentage of the total Cr
content with increasing Cr oxide loading. In addition,
the
polychromate:chromate
ratio
increases
with
increasing Cr loading, indicating that less (reactive)
hydroxyl groups are available to stabilize the surface
chromium oxide as an anchored chromate species
[29]. This results in weakly bonded polychromate
species, which are (more) easily removed via rinsing
with cold water [39]. Besides Cr6/5, Cr3 is also
detected by XPS, DRS and EPR [1]. These Cr3-
species
are
present
as
isolated
surface
species
(d-signal in EPR) and/or amorphous oxide clusters
(b-signal in EPR) of small sizes, which are XRD-
invisible.
At much higher Cr oxide loadings, i.e. above mono-
layer coverage loading, Cr3 is the dominant species,
and the fraction of Cr6 is rather low. Two types of
Cr3 are observed isolated and clustered Cr3. The
latter can be present as either crystalline a-Cr2O3,
which is XRD-detectable, and amorphous Cr2O3. The
remaining fraction of Cr6 is typically around 2 wt%,
as shown in Table 3. It is also important to mention
here that different research groups have experimen-
tally determined a monolayer coverage of about 4 Cr/
nm2. This corresponds, depending on the surface area
of the alumina support, with 6±8 wt%. Although Vuur-
man et al. [20] report that up to a monolayer almost all
the chromium oxide species are stabilized as Cr6,
other research groups have observed both Cr3 and
Cr6 at monolayer coverage. For example, Kozlowski
[50] reports that only 60% of Cr is stabilized as Cr6 at
monolayer coverage. These discrepancies in literature
must be attributed to differences in preparation and

pretreatment conditions. The initial calcination tem-
perature seems in this respect very important because
of the low thermal stability of anchored polychromate
species, which are readily convertable to Cr3. Sum-
marizing, different surface species are observed on the
surface of freshly prepared catalysts, their relative
concentration mainly depending on the overall Cr
loading, the alumina surface area, and the calcination
treatment.
4.2.
Active catalysts
Up to now, most reported characterization studies
were done under conditions often far away from real
catalytic conditions. This is mainly due to the fact that
in situ capabilities have only recently become com-
mercially available. As a consequence, only a limited
number of in situ characterization studies are available
in the literature. The most promising techniques in this
respect are Raman spectroscopy and diffuse re¯ec-
tance spectroscopy in the UV±Vis region, both tech-
niques are suitable to monitor surface Cr-species
during alkane dehydrogenations [32,33,36,37,57±
59]. In situ Raman spectroscopy has been used to
study the reduction process of surface Cr6 species on
a 5 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of n-butane.
It was concluded that polychromate was more readily
reducible than monochromate [32]. However, above
3508C the in situ Raman spectra became less infor-
mative due to coke formation. In situ DRS spectro-
scopy studies on 0.1±8.0 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts
show that surface Cr6 species are reduced at high
temperature in the presence of n-butane or isobutane
to mainly pseudo-octahedral Cr3 [57±59]. Thus, sur-
face Cr3 species are formed under reaction condi-
tions at the expense of Cr6. The in situ DRS cell was
coupled with a GC in order to monitor on line the
activity and selectivity of the catalysts under study. It
was found that there is a ± more or less ± quantitative
relationship between the amount of pseudo-octahedral
Cr3 formed by reduction and the dehydrogenation
activity [58,59]. The nature of these surface Cr3
species was further unraveled by infrared spectro-
scopy measurements of adsorbed probe molecules
(CO/NO). De Rossi et al. [45] concluded that isolated
Cr3 sites with two coordinative vacancies are formed
on 0.16±1.55 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence
of n-propane. In conclusion, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts con-
tain coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 species under
reaction conditions.
4.3.
Deactivated catalysts
The industrial cycling of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts under
oxidizing and reducing conditions strongly affects
their physicochemical structure, and ultimately leads
to catalyst deactivation. First of all, the speci®c sur-
face area of the catalyst decreases with increasing
time-on-stream, increasing reaction temperature and
increasing number of catalytic cycles [42]. In addition,
the amount of surface Cr6 decreased with increasing
number of cycles. Hakuli et al. [42] observed that in a
fresh 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst 15% of the Cr was
present as Cr6, whereas after 25 cycles, the amount of
Cr6 as a percentage of the total Cr content was only
12.7. Thus, part of the Cr6 was irreversibly reduced
to a lower oxidation state. The same authors also found
an almost linear relationship between the initial dehy-
drogenation activity and the amount of Cr6 as deter-
mined by XPS in the spent catalyst [42].
Similar results were obtained by De Rossi et al.
[45]. These authors observed that the extent of reduc-
tion (as determined from the amount of H2 or CO
consumed by their Cr/Al2O3 catalysts) decreases with
increasing number of reduction±dehydrogenation±
recalcination cycles. This decrease has been attributed
to an incomplete reoxidation of reduced Cr3 species.
In another systematic study, 0.1±0.8 wt% Cr/Al2O3

catalysts have been studied by combined DRS-EPR
spectroscopies after successive reduction±reoxidation
cycles [24]. Upon reduction with CO, surface Cr6
species were mainly reduced to Cr3, which could
only be partially reoxidized to Cr6. Thus, Cr3 seems
to be stabilized in/on the alumina surface. These
phenomena can be explained by the incorporation
of Cr3 in the vacant octahedral sites of the spinel
surface of alumina. Diffusion into these vacant Al3
sites is facilitated by the similar ionic radii and charge
of Cr3 and Al3. Detailed 27Al MAS NMR measure-
ments suggest that Cr3 occupies sites on alumina in
the close vicinity of the octahedral Al3 sites, con-
tinuing the spinel structure of the alumina [26]. This
suggests that a type of Cr2O3±Al2O3 spinel is formed
during catalytic cycling, which results in the deactiva-
tion of the catalyst. However, it is clear that more
characterization work has to be done to fully under-
stand this deactivation process.
5.
Catalyst activity and selectivity
There is a general consensus in the literature that the
activity pattern of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts
is dependent on the overall Cr loading, the dehydro-
genation temperature and the time-on-stream [6,7]
The initial dehydrogenation activity increases, inde-
pendently of the type of alkane, almost linearly with
increasing Cr loading. However, at Cr loadings typi-
cally higher than 4±10 wt% Cr, the activity gain levels
off or even decreases. Furthermore, the overall activity
decreases with increasing time-on-stream and with an
increasing number of regeneration±dehydrogenation
cycles in cyclic operation. This deactivation is attrib-
uted to the increased formation of coke. It is also
important to notice here that the overall coke forma-
tion increases with an increasing number of regenera-
tion±dehydrogenation cycles. This implies that coke
formation is not solely responsible for catalyst deac-
tivation. A constant dehydrogenation activity over the
total life-span of the catalyst can be achieved by
gradually increasing the reaction temperature with
increasing time-on-stream.
The selectivity pattern is also a function of the time-
on-stream. In the beginning of the reaction, the selec-
tivity towards alkenes is rather low, and CO and CO2
are mainly formed. After this induction time, the
alkene selectivity increases typically above 90%.
Other detectable products are ligther alkanes/alkenes
(e.g. methane), benzene, and toluene. As an example,
the catalytic test run performances of one of the
world's largest dehydrogenation plant for MTBE pro-
duction with an isobutene production capacity of
452 000 metric tons per year, are given in Table 4
[55]. It is concluded that a selectivity towards iso-
butene of 93.6% can be obtained at a conversion of
55%, and that the fraction of lighter and heavier
hydrocarbons is rather small. The selectivity remains
stable, and can be maintained well into the middle of
the catalyst-life, and only declines toward the end-of-
run, which is typically after one or two years.
There is, however, no agreement about the effect of
reducing agents on the initial dehydrogenation activ-
ity, and different authors have observed different
effects. De Rossi et al. [45] reported that pre-reduction
of the Cr/Al2O3 catalysts (0.04±2.55 wt% Cr) with
carbon monoxide or hydrogen had no in¯uence on the
dehydrogenation of propane. In a study of the n-
hexane aromatization activity of prereduced Cr/
Al2O3
catalysts
(10.5 wt%
Cr),
Grunert
et
al.
[40,41] also found that the nature of the reducing
agent (H2, CH4, n-hexane or CO) did not in¯uence
the activity. On the other hand, Gorriz et al. [37]
observed slight differences in the dehydrogenation
activity depending on the reducing agent (H2, propane
or CO). These authors concluded from a detailed
analysis of the product distribution with a gas chro-
matograph, that the main differences occurred during
the ®rst 10 min on stream. Recently, Hakuli et al. [42]
have monitored with FT-IR spectroscopy the very ®rst

stages of the dehydrogenation of butane over Cr/Al2O3
catalysts (13 wt% Cr), and provided interesting data
on the initial dehydrogenation activity on prereduced
surfaces. The authors found that pre-reduction with
methane or H2 had no noticeable effect on the catalytic
activity and selectivity. Clearly different results were
obtained when the catalyst was reduced with carbon
monoxide. The formation of cracking products (C1±
C3) was increased during the ®rst 60 s on stream and
the initial selectivity for butenes was rather low.
However, the selectivity for butenes increased with
increasing time on stream, and within 2 min a selec-
tivity pattern was observed comparable with that
obtained with methane- and hydrogen-pre-reduced
catalysts. The effect of the carbon monoxide pre-
reduction depended on the reduction temperature,
and below 4008C no effect on the catalytic activity
and selectivity was observed. The negative effect of
CO has been explained in terms of coke formation,
and of a deeper reduction of supported chromium
oxides with carbon monoxide than with n-butane,
methane or H2. Finally, it is important to stress here
that
industrially
used
CrOx/Al2O3
catalysts
are
reduced prior to alkane dehydrogenation (after burn-
ing off the coke in the regeneration step). This sug-
gests that reduction of a regenerated catalyst has a
bene®cial effect for the catalyst used on an industrial
scale.
Although the addition of dopants has been consid-
ered to promote activity and/or selectivity, its bene-
®cial role is not properly understood. Some authors
even observed a decreasing activity upon the addition
of dopants [6,7]. Recent work on isobutane dehydro-
genation, however, showed that the effect of potassium
strongly depends on both the Cr- and K-loading [39].
For a 7.7 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, an increase of
dehydrogenation activity was observed at a K2O
loading of 0.8 wt%. On the other hand, the same
authors observed that a catalyst containing only
5.3 wt% Cr showed a decrease in activity with increas-
ing K2O loading [39].
Summarizing, high alkane dehydrogenation activ-
ities and selectivities can be reached over Cr/Al2O3
catalysts by ®ne-tuning the operating conditions (reac-
tion
temperature,
regeneration±dehydrogenation
cycles, reactant ¯ow rate, etc.) as well as the catalyst
composition (chromium loading, addition of dopants,
etc.).
6.
Molecular structure±reactivity relationships
The reported characterization results, in combina-
tion with the catalytic results, allow a detailed dis-
cussion of the nature of the chromium active site for
alkane dehydrogenation. The discussion will be
focused on (a) the oxidation state, (b) the coordinative
requirements, and (c) nuclearity of the active site in
Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. On this basis, a catalytic mechan-
ism for alkane dehydrogenation is proposed.
6.1.
Oxidation state
The oxidation state of the active species has been
the subject of debate and controversy for many years.
According to several authors the active species in
alkane dehydrogenation is Cr3, while other authors
propose both Cr2 and Cr3, or solely Cr2 as the
active species. These discrepancies in literature can be
due to differences in catalyst pretreatment and pre-
paration. It is also important to stress here that the
catalyst has to reach a well-de®ned equilibrated sur-
face composition. Nevertheless, the present literature
data, more particularly the in situ characterization
results, con®rm the absence of oxidized surface chro-
mium oxide species, i.e. Cr6 and Cr5, and the
presence of Cr3 in an active Cr/Al2O3 catalyst.
Furthermore, surface Cr6/5 species seems to be
the precursor for these active Cr3 sites, at least at
low Cr loadings. The reduction of the oxidized surface
chromium oxide species is responsible for the rather
low selectivities towards alkenes in the beginning of
the dehydrogenation reaction.
6.2.
Coordinative requirements
The catalytic data clearly show that the conversion
towards alkenes does not linearly increase with
increasing Cr loading for catalysts above monolayer
coverage. Some authors have even reported a decrease
in catalytic activity at such high Cr loadings. The
characterization studies, on the other hand, reveal the
presence of crystalline Cr2O3-clusters in such cata-
lysts. This suggests that bulk Cr3-ions, with a perfect
and stable octahedrally surrounding, are inactive for
alkane dehydrogenations. Thus, surface Cr3-ions
with an incomplete coordination have to be active.
Such ions will try to re-establish the very stable

con®guration of bulk Cr3-ions by capturing mole-
cules, such as alkanes, from the gas phase. De Rossi
et al. were able to show by infrared spectroscopy that
two NO molecules could be adsorbed by a mono-
nuclear surface Cr3-ion [45]. Thus, coordinatively
unsaturated Cr3-ions are the active centers for
alkane dehydrogenations.
6.3.
Nuclearity
The almost linear relationship between dehydro-
genation activity and Cr loading below monolayer
coverage indicates that both isolated and clustered
Cr3-centers can be active. Indeed, the spectroscopic
data indicate that three types of Cr3-ions are pre-
sent under reaction conditions below monolayer
coverage:
1. Cr3-ions formed by reduction of surface Cr6/5-
ions.
2. Cr3-ions present as isolated centers stabilized on
the alumina surface.
3. Small amorphous Cr3-clusters which are XRD-
invisible.
However, with the present knowledge it is almost
impossible to discriminate between the individual
contributions of these Cr3-centers to the overall
catalytic activity and selectivity. Nevertheless, there
are indications that surface Cr6/5-ions, forming the
dispersed surface phase on the alumina and/or chro-
mia (Cr2O3), are the precursors for the Cr3 dehy-
drogenation centers. The following arguments can be
put forward
1. Hakuli et al. [42] have demonstrated that the
initial dehydrogenation activity is directly propor-
tional to the initial amount of surface Cr6;
2. Weckhuysen et al. [57±59] have shown by in situ
DRS that there exists a semi-quantitative relation-
ship between the catalytic activity and the amount
of Cr3 formed by reduction of Cr6;
3. Surface Cr6/5-species, which are the dominant
species at low loadings, give rise to dehydrogena-
tion activity, and the activity increases with
increasing amount of Cr.
Thus, it is reasonable to assume that about 90% of the
catalytic activity is related to dispersed phase, while
the other co-existing phases are crucial for the con-
tinuous replenishment of the depleted surface phase
during (prolonged) catalytic actions.
A possible catalytic mechanism for alkane dehy-
drogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts is given in Fig. 1.
It involves the adsorption of an alkane on a coordina-
tively unsaturated Cr3-center, which can be either
isolated or clustered. In a second step, the C±H bond of
the alkane is broken, and a OH±bond and a Cr±C bond
are formed. In the ®nal step, an alkene is formed,
which is released from the surface, and the catalytic
surface is regenerated by the formation of H2.

Conclusions
The catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane and
propane over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts is an important pro-
cess which is used worldwide in the chemical indus-
tries because it represents an inexpensive route to
obtain high-purity alkenes from hydrocarbon feed-
stocks. These catalysts are composed of chromium
oxides dispersed on a porous alumina support, and
often contain a dopant such as potassium. The dehy-
drogenation activity almost linearly increases with
increasing Cr loading up to monolayer coverage. At
higher Cr loadings the activity gain levels off or even
decreases. The present characterization results point
towards the important role of both isolated and clus-
tered coordinatively unsaturated Cr3-centers for the
activation of alkanes. However, more characterization
results have to be done under conditions close to
catalytic conditions. This will ultimately lead to ±
more relevant ± structure/composition±activity/selec-
tivity relationships, and the development of an expert
system for an industrial dehydrogenation reactor.
