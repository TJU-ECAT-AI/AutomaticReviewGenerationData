The activity of the vanadium magnesium binary oxides supported on Cact, SiO2, c-Al2O3 and ZnO in the dehydrogenation of
isobutane to isobutene under the carbon dioxide or inert gas atmosphere was investigated. The highest isobutene yield (34.8%) was
obtained over active carbon supported catalyst. The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process was determined on the
basis of additional tests: the RWGS reaction, gasiﬁcation of coke and regeneration of partially reduced catalysts. The temperature-
programmed techniques (TPR-H2, TPD-NH3 and TPD-CO2) were used to characterize the catalysts.
KEY WORDS: isobutane dehydrogenation; VMgOx supported catalysts; role of carbon dioxide.
1. Introduction
At present, isobutene is typically obtained by cata-
lytic dehydrogenation of isobutane and as a by-product
of steam cracking or a ﬂuidized catalytic cracking of
naphtha. The AAB Lummus Global, the world leader of
catalytic dehydrogenation technology, have licensed
eight CATOFIN process units, which provide isobu-
tylene with an aggregate capacity of about 2.8 million
metric tons per annum (MTA) [1,2]. Dehydrogenation
of isobutane is known as an equilibrium and endother-
mic reaction (1).

For thermodynamics reasons, signiﬁcant yield of alkene
requires operation at relatively high temperatures what
causes high-energy costs. Moreover, such process con-
ditions favor undesired thermal cracking reactions to
lighter hydrocarbons and leads to rapid catalyst deac-
tivation by coke [3–5].
An alternative to this process is an oxidative dehy-
drogenation (ODH) of isobutane by molecular oxygen
(2).

ð2Þ
The ODH gives the following beneﬁts: the reaction is
irreversible and exothermic, process can be carried out
at lower temperatures and there is no carbon deposition
deactivating the catalyst. However, using oxygen as an
oxidant of isobutane brings several problems, such as
ﬂammability of the reaction mixture, necessity of the
heat removal and the presence of deep oxidation reac-
tions, which are very hard to control. These side reac-
tions lower the process selectivity due to the production
of undesired carbon oxides [4–6]. Therefore, it is
expected that replacing oxygen in the oxidative dehy-
drogenation reactions by weak oxidants, such as SO2,
N2O and CO2, will suppress these disadvantages [7–10].
Recently, several attempts were made to use carbon
dioxide as an unconventional source of oxygen in the
oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane [9–16]. The
overall reaction can be described as follow (3):
iC4H10 þ CO2 Ð iC4H8 þ CO þ H2O
DHo
298 ¼ 158:41 kJ=mol
ð3Þ
It has to be pointed out that the dehydrogenation of
isobutane in the presence of carbon dioxide can proceed
by two diﬀerent reaction pathways. The ﬁrst one is a
direct process, shown in the equation 3, where the CO2
promotes the dehydrogenation through reoxidizing the
catalyst surface, reduced by isobutane. This one-step
pathway is in agreement with the Mars and van Krev-
elen mechanism [11,12]. The second one, known as a
two-step pathway, is a simple dehydrogenation (equa-
tion 1) followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction
(RWGS, equation 4):
H2 þ CO2 Ð H2 þ CO
DHo
298 ¼ 41:13 kJ=mol ð4Þ
In this case CO2 removes hydrogen from the reaction
system and releases the thermodynamic limitation of
equilibrium [4]. Many results indicate that isobutene is
formed by both presented mechanisms [11,12]. More-
over, in the dehydrogenation process carbon dioxide can

In our previous papers we presented the results of iso-
butane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide over
vanadium magnesium oxides [16,17] and vanadium
oxide catalysts loaded on diﬀerent supports [18]. We
found that VMgOx catalyst (V/Mg = 0.11 molar ratio)
prepared by citrate method exhibit relatively high
activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane. The pres-
ence of carbon dioxide enhanced the alkane conversion
[17], as in the case of the active carbon supported
vanadium oxide [18]. The opposite trend was observed
over VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/ZnO catalysts while silica
supported vanadium oxide didnt show considerable
sensitivity to the reaction atmosphere [18]. Those
experiments brought us the question how much the
catalytic performance and the physicochemical proper-
ties of the vanadium magnesium oxide catalyst can be
changed by loading it on the new mentioned supports.
To ﬁnd the answer, catalytic tests with isobutane and
carbon dioxide were carried out together with the
temperature-programmed
reduction
and
desorption
analysis.
2. Experimental
The supported VMgOx catalysts with the V/Mg
molar
ratio
of
0.11
were
prepared
by
combined
impregnation - citrate method. The supports: Cact, c-
Al2O3, SiO2 and ZnO were suspended in a transparent
aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate, magne-
sium nitrate and citric acid in such amount to yield a
nominal 4 wt% of V2O5. Next, the slurry was evapo-
rated at 353 K while stirring, and then dried at 373 K
for 12 h. Except the active carbon supported catalyst,
the solid precursors were calcined in static air at 923 K
for 6 h, pressed to thin discs and crushed to form the
ﬁnal bulk catalyst samples (d = 0.2–0.3 mm). Prior the
impregnation the silica gel was dried for 3 h at 180 C to
obtain anhydrous silicon dioxide. All the supports were
powdered while the activated carbon was crushed to the
particles with 0.2–0.3 mm diameter. The unsupported
VMgOx catalyst was prepared by the citrate method
[17].
The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was
carried out under atmospheric pressure at 873 K. Prior
to the reaction, the catalysts were placed in a reactor and
outgassed in helium for 0.5 h. Then the reactor was fed
with iC4H10 and CO2 (or He) in the molar ratio of 1:6
and total ﬂow rate 35 cm3 min)1. In the case of active
carbon supported catalyst, the sample was ﬁrst activated
at 923 K in carbon dioxide ﬂow (30 cm3 min)1). After
10 min, the temperature was lowered to 873 K and the
sample was degassed for further 10 min in helium. The
products formed during the dehydrogenation were
analyzed on-line with two gas chromatographs. The
details were given elsewhere [16,17].
The speciﬁc surface area (BET method) of the cata-
lysts was determined at 77 K using nitrogen as the
adsorbate. The temperature-programmed studies were
carried out in a quartz reactor connected on-line with a
thermal conductivity detector. All the samples were
pretreated using the same procedure as that used for the
catalytic tests. For TPD-NH3 and TPD-CO2 experi-
ments, the outgassed samples (0.2 g) were cooled to
room temperature under dry helium ﬂow and than sat-
urated with ammonia or carbon dioxide for 0.5 h
(30 cm3 min)1). The unadsorbed gases were ﬂushed out
of the reactor by ﬂowing helium (60 cm3 min)1), and
ﬁnally the temperature was increased to 873 K at the
heating rate of 10 K min)1. Desorbed species were
analyzed on-line. For the TPR-H2 experiments the cat-
alysts were taken in such amounts as to give the samples
with 8 mg of V2O5 content. The catalysts were reduced
with the mixture of hydrogen and argon (1:9 volume
ratio, 30 cm3 min)1) by programming the temperature
from room temperature to 900 K at the constant heating
rate of 10 K min)1. The maximum temperature was
kept unchanged, until the rate of hydrogen consumption
returned to the initial value. The TCD peak areas were
calibrated by injections of dry, gaseous ammonia, car-
bon dioxide and pure argon for TPD and TPR experi-
ments respectively. The reduction extent of V species
(H2/V)mol and the average formal oxidation number of
vanadium after TPR-H2 analysis were calculated [19].
3. Results and discussion
Figure 1 shows the isobutane conversion and isobu-
tene selectivity as a function of the reaction time at
873 K. The process was carried out both in the presence
and absence of carbon dioxide. To minimize the adverse
thermal eﬀect and to keep the vanadium content in the
samples at the same level of 18 mg V2O5, precisely 0.4 g
of the supported catalysts were taken to the catalytic
tests. Moreover, the unsupported VMgOx was diluted
with glass grains (weight ratio of 1:4) what allowed
obtaining the reactor packing with the same vanadium
content. To identify the possibility of thermal dehy-
drogenation of isobutane over the glass, blank test also
has been carried out (0.4 g of glass particles with 0.2–
0.3 mm diameter).
For unsupported vanadium magnesium oxide and
active carbon supported catalyst after 10 min of the
reaction, the isobutane conversion was higher in the
presence of carbon dioxide than that under helium
atmosphere. However, when the reaction period was
increased, the reduction of catalyst activity was lower in
the presence of helium. Therefore, the isobutene yield in
the CO2 was higher only at the ﬁrst part of process. Only

in the case of silica supported vanadium magnesium
oxide, the isobutane conversion in the carbon dioxide
ﬂow was higher than that in helium during the whole
experiment. The opposite trend was observed when the
dehydrogenation was carried out over VMgOx/Al2O3
and VMgOx/ZnO – then the isobutene yield in helium
was higher than that in the presence of carbon dioxide.
Moreover, the catalytic activity of the alumina sup-
ported vanadium magnesium oxide gradually increased
to a small extent during the ﬁrst 30 min of the run in
helium atmosphere. Thermal dehydrogenation over
glass particles gave traces of isobutene (1% yield) in
the both atmospheres.
Because of the rapid catalyst deactivation, the most
interesting are ﬁrst minutes of the dehydrogenation
process. Data presented in table 1 show initial average
results of the isobutane dehydrogenation over the
vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts used in this work.
To measure the average conversion and selectivity
within ﬁrst 10 min of the process, the gases at the
reactor outlet were collected in separate bottles and then
analyzed chromatographically.

The main products of the isobutane dehydrogenation
were isobutene, propene and methane. There were also
small amounts of propane, ethane and ethylene. Only
over alumina, silica and active carbon supported cata-
lysts traces of n-butenes were detected in the both
reaction atmospheres. The selectivity to n-C4 hydrocar-
bons was constant during the isobutane dehydrogena-
tion,
except
for
the
VMgOx/Cact
catalyst,
where
n-butenes disappeared after 0.5 h of reaction. The
presence of the isomerization products can be explained
by relatively strong acidity of the catalysts (table 2).
This eﬀect is related to the fact that isobutane and larger
hydrocarbons have a negative charge on the most
reactive hydrogen, what favors their interaction with
electrophilic (acidic) surfaces. Nevertheless, electron-
donating oleﬁns are more basic than the corresponding
paraﬃns, so their desorption from acidic surfaces is
more diﬃcult [20,21]. Strong interaction with the cata-
lyst surface may promote further isomerization and
degradation of the dehydrogenation products to coke,
which was conﬁrmed by our experiments. Except for
hydrocarbons, hydrogen, carbon oxide and water were
detected. Small amount of CO detected during the iso-
butane dehydrogenation in helium could come from
interaction of lattice oxygen with the reagents. Forma-
tion of atomic oxygen from magnesium orthovanadate
(Mg3V2O8), proposed by Burrows et al. [22], proceeds
according to the equation (6) with simultaneous reduc-
tion of vanadium ions from V+5 to V+3
Mg3V2O8 ! 2MgO þ MgV2O4 þ 2O
ð6Þ
The subsequent reaction of atomic oxygen with H2
shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium. This can explain
the small growth of the isobutane conversion, which was
observed over alumina supported catalyst during the
ﬁrst 30 min of the process carried out in helium atmo-
sphere. For the same reason and the possibility of fur-
ther hydrogenolysis, the H2/iC4H8 molar ratio was
below one for the dehydrogenation of isobutane in
helium over VMgOx/SiO2 catalyst.
In the presence of an oxidizing agent (CO2) the lattice
oxygen becomes available for the Mars and van Krev-
elen reaction mechanism [11,12], but it is known from
the literature that the reversibility of the reaction (6) is
very low [22]. Therefore, most of carbon oxide produced
during the dehydrogenation in CO2 atmosphere comes
from the reverse water gas shift reaction (4) and the
gasiﬁcation of coke (5). To conﬁrm this hypothesis
additional tests were carried out.
A stream of CO2 (30 cm3 min)1) was passed through
the fresh, coked and partially reduced catalyst at 873 K.
All the products were collected during the ﬁrst 10 min of
each test and analyzed chromatographically. Carbon
oxide yields calculated from the tests (i.e., the blank
test, the gasiﬁcation of coke and the reoxidation of
vanadium respectively), were compared with the aver-
age amount of CO formed in the RWGS reaction
(H2:CO2 = 1:6 molar ratio). From the data presented
in table 2 it is clearly seen that the highest CO yields
were obtained during the reverse water gas shift reac-
tion. The blank tests over unsupported VMgOx and
supported alumina, silica and zinc oxide catalysts,
showed that carbon dioxide does not interact with the
vanadium at high oxidation state. Although consider-
able amount of CO was formed over freshly activated
VMgOx/Cact, we have to take into account the nature of
the support, which can interact with the carbon dioxide
in the Boudouard reaction (5). Moreover, the TPR-H2
and XRD analysis proved that active carbon supported
catalysts contain vanadium oxide at a lower oxidation
state [18,23]. Therefore, the carbon dioxide can also
participate in reoxidation of the catalyst. Possibility of
such reaction was conﬁrmed by the tests with partially
reduced catalysts, where measurable amounts of CO
were detected.
The nature of the catalyst surface was tested by
temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2.
As the probe gases were adsorbed at room temperature,
the ﬁrst peak (up to 373 K) should be associated with
the physisorbed NH3 and CO2. The higher temperatures
maxima can be assigned to desorption of chemisorbed
species from the sites of diﬀerent strength [24]: weak
(below 473 K), medium (473–573 K) and strong (above
573 K). The amounts of desorbed ammonia and carbon
dioxide were calculated from the overall TCD signal
areas, calibrated by injections of pure NH3 and CO2.
The percentage of strong acidic (basic) site were deter-
mined from the ratio of the TPD area for the particular
temperature region, to the TPD area associated with
chemisorption (table 3).
The percentage of strong basic sites in VMgOx sup-
ported catalysts decreases in the sequence: ZnO >
Al2O3 > Cact > VMgOx > SiO2. The same order is
observed for the average carbon oxide yields in the
reverse water gas shift reaction (table 2). Moreover, the
CO/iC4H8 molar ratios obtained for the dehydrogena-
tion in carbon dioxide ﬂow (table 1) decrease in similar

fashion. Therefore, the high concentration of strong
basic centers on the catalyst surface facilitates conver-
sion of CO2 (acidic molecule). As carbon dioxide
adsorbs at the basic sites, the relative acidity of the
catalysts surface increases. Consequently, the selectivity
to isobutene decreases, whereas the selectivity to isom-
erization and degradation products increases. This
conclusion stays in agreement with our experiments,
where the isobutane dehydrogenation in the presence of
CO2 gave lower isobutene selectivity than that in helium
atmosphere (table 1).
Figure 2 shows the TPR-H2 proﬁles of the tested
VMgOx catalysts. The initial temperature of hydrogen
uptake is around 580–660 K for all of the catalysts
studied. Moreover, its position increases in the same
sequence as Tmax – the temperature of maximum
hydrogen consumption (table 4). Because of extremely
high hydrogen uptake over VMgOx/Cact, the TPR-H2
experiments were done for the non-loaded supports
(ﬁgure 3).
Only two of the supports show positive TCD signal
during the TPR-H2 experiment. ZnO proﬁle shows small
hydrogen uptake with the maximum at 673 K, which
can be related to some reduction of Zn2+ to zinc metal
[25]. On the other hand, very high consumption of
hydrogen by activated carbon is caused by the chemical
nature of the support. It is well known that activation of
carbon with oxidizing acids and heating it in carbon
dioxide ﬂow yields various oxygen-containing species on
its surface. The most important of them are: carboxylic
acids and anhydrides, carboxyl-carbonates, lactones,
phenols and quinines [26]. Decomposition of oxygen
functional groups on carbon surface upon heating in an
inert atmosphere has been the subject of many investi-
gations [26–28]. It is well established that thermal
treatment of activated carbon at 923 K eliminates
almost all of the CO2-yielding complexes like carboxylic
acids, anhydrides and lactones. Despite that, carbon
surface still contains an appreciable amount of phenolic
and quinolic groups, which have carbon oxide evolution
maxima at 900 and 1100 K respectively [26]. These
phenomena were conﬁrmed by simple test, where carbon
sample was activated in CO2 ﬂow and outgassed in
argon at 923 K. The sample still contained some oxygen
groups on the surface, as CO was detected upon further
heating of sample at the temperature above 900 K.
Despite that, no methane was detected during the tem-
perature-programmed reduction experiment.
Presence of reducible oxygen groups would explain
high hydrogen uptake by both activated carbon and
carbon-supported VMgOx catalyst. Consequently, the
proper hydrogen consumption by vanadium species
(table 4) was calculated as the diﬀerence between the H2
uptake over VMgOx loaded catalyst and that corre-
sponding to the support.
As the hydrogen consumption by VMgOx species was
similar for all of the supported catalysts, the average
oxidation number (nav) of vanadium was established to

be around 4. That means that magnesium orthovana-
date (Mg3V2O8) is reduced on the catalyst surface
mainly to Mg2VO4. Chang et al. [29] proved that
reversibility of such reduction is relatively high in the
presence of oxygen (7), what is caused by similarity
between the structure of both vanadates.

As the transformation between the structures requires
only a small shift in oxy gen atom positions [29], there is
a great possibility for a weak oxidant, such as carbon
dioxide, to oxidize the catalyst surface. Such reaction
explains the presence of carbon oxide among the prod-
ucts collected during the CO2 interaction with partially
reduced catalyst (table 2).

Al2O3, ZnO and Cact aﬀord new catalysts with diﬀerent
performance in the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction.
Large surface area of the supported catalysts is not the
crucial parameter deciding about their catalytic activity.
Much more important are both redox and acid–base
properties of the catalysts. Low reducibility of the silica
supported VMgOx causes low isobutane conversion,
while its dominating acidic character decides about low
conversion of carbon dioxide. Analogously, low acidity
and high concentration of strong basic centers on active
carbon, alumina and zinc oxide supported catalysts
improves the activation of carbon dioxide.
The performed tests show that isobutane dehydro-
genation in carbon dioxide atmosphere over VMgOx
catalysts proceed mostly via a two-step pathway. High
conversions in the RWGS reaction, especially well seen
over alumina and zinc oxide supported catalysts, indi-
cate that the main role of CO2 is removing hydrogen
from the reaction mixture and releasing the thermody-
namic limitation of equilibrium. From the other site, the
formation of CO in the experiments carried out over
coked and partially reduced catalysts indicates that
carbon dioxide shows some activity in the catalyst
reoxidation and coke gasiﬁcation reactions at 873 K.
Moreover, low activity of the bulk, silica and active
carbon supported VMgOx in RWGS reaction, together
with promoting eﬀect of CO2 in the isobutane dehy-
drogenation, indicate that one-step pathway of the
process cannot be completely excluded. In comparison
to Al2O3 and ZnO supported samples, the other VMgOx
catalysts are also characterized by slightly higher tem-
perature of maximum hydrogen consumption and lower
content of strong acid and basic sites.
