Abstract
PtSn/TiO2 catalysts containing 2 wt% Pt and a Pt:Sn atomic ratio of 2:1 and 1:1 were prepared by coimpregnation or successive impregnation
method with aqueous solutions of SnCl22H2O and H2PtCl66H2O of a commercial TiO2 (P25, from Degussa). Both catalyst series, independent of
the preparation method, were reduced at 473 and 773 K. XPS results show that tin was in an oxidized state after reduction at 473 K, and that a
fraction was in the metallic state after reduction at 773 K. By use of in situ FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, the presence of bimetallic Pt–Sn
phases was assessed after reduction at 773 K. Microcalorimetric analysis of CO adsorption enthalpy indicates that reduction at 773 K causes the
appearance of a more heterogeneous distribution of active sites, as well as a loss in the amount of sites. The catalytic activity for the gas phase
hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was greatly improved when the catalysts were prepared by coimpregnation, at both reduction temperatures. The
selectivity toward crotyl alcohol was higher after reduction at 773 K and independent of the preparation method, although it increased with the
amount of tin, suggesting a promoting effect of tin on this reaction.

1. Introduction
Supported bimetallic PtSn catalysts are widely used for
reforming and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the
petroleum industry and for selective hydrogenation reactions
in ﬁne chemistry because of their better performance, in terms
of activity and stability, than monometallic platinum catalyst
[1–5]. As an example, the addition of tin to platinum modiﬁes
the selectivity in naphtha reforming, resulting in a higher
resistance against deactivation by coke deposition [5].
In the ﬁeld of ﬁne chemistry, the selective hydrogenation of
a,b-unsaturated
aldehydes
to
obtain
the
corresponding
unsaturated alcohols is a reaction of industrial importance.
In addition, it is a suitable model reaction to investigate the
effect of the catalyst structure on the selectivity. Since the
hydrogenation
of
the
C C
bond
is
thermodynamically
favoured, the selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol is
generally poor. In this case, monometallic platinum catalysts
give no or a very low selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol.
An improvement in the selectivity can be often obtained by the
addition of a second metal of the ﬁrst transition row, a p block
metal or an alkali element. Previous studies reported the use of
Fe [6], Ga, Ge, Sn [7–14] and K [15,16]. The enhancement of
catalytic selectivity by addition of tin has been explained as a
result of the cooperation of two phenomena. On one hand, the
carbonyl group is activated by ionic tin species, which interact
with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl bond and thus facilitate its
hydrogenation. On the other hand, the dilution of platinum
atoms by metallic tin hinders the hydrogenation of the C C
bond and suppresses the readsorption of the unsaturated alcohol
formed, thus inhibiting its isomerisation to the saturated
aldehyde and even its further hydrogenation to the saturated
alcohol [12,14,17,18].
Another way of improving the selectivity toward the
unsaturated alcohol is the use of supports such as CeO2 [19–
21], TiO2 [11,22], ZnO [23], MgO [18], or SnO2 [24] that can
modify the catalytic properties of the dispersed metal or
bimetallic system. Tauster et al. [25,26] found that the use as a
support of a partially reducible oxide, such as TiO2, could
modify the chemisorption ability of metals from groups 8, 9 and

10 for hydrogen and carbon monoxide after reduction at high
temperature (about 773 K). The term ‘‘strong metal–support
interaction (SMSI)’’ was introduced to describe this effect.
Furthermore, it was demonstrated that this interaction could
also modify the activity and selectivity of noble metal in
different reactions, such as those involving molecules contain-
ing carbonyl bonds. Vannice et al. found the promoter effect of
TiO2 on metals from group 8 after reduction at 773 K for
several reactions. They showed that the activity for CO
hydrogenation was much greater on Pd/TiO2 in the SMSI state
than for palladium supported on silica, alumina, or silica–
alumina [27,28]. Similar results have been found during
hydrogenation of acetone [29], crotonaldehyde [22,30,31],
acetophenone [32], phenylacetaldehyde [33], and benzalde-
hyde [34] on Pt/TiO2 catalysts. Resasco and Haller [35]
proposed a model involving a delocalized charge transfer from
the metal to TiO2 after low temperature reduction, and a
localized charge transfer from the support to the metal after
high temperature reduction. Some years later, these authors
suggested that the migration of reduced species from the
support onto the metal particle occurred after reduction at high
temperature [36]. This geometrical effect would account for the
decrease in the chemisorption capacity of hydrogen and carbon
monoxide of the catalysts in the SMSI state, because the
amount of surface platinum atoms is diminished. Moreover, the
creation of special sites at the interface between the metal and
the partially reduced support would account for the enhanced
selectivity toward unsaturated alcohols. These sites, which
consist of partially reduced TiOx species (Ti3+ or oxygen
vacancies) would interact with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl
group, weakening the bond and thereby facilitating hydro-
genation.
The preparation mode of bimetallic catalysts has a great
importance, because the interaction between both metals and
the support, which determines the catalytic behaviour, depends
greatly on the preparation method used. The aim of this work
has been the study of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts, with
different Pt:Sn atomic ratios prepared by two different
methods: coimpregnation of both metal precursors or succes-
sive impregnation with the tin precursor loaded ﬁrst. The
catalysts were tested in the selective hydrogenation of
crotonaldehyde. The inﬂuence of the strong metal–support
interaction effect on this reaction is also studied by using low
(473 K) and high (773 K) reduction temperature treatments.
2. Experimental
Degussa P25 TiO2 (60% anatase, 40% rutile), with a surface
area of 50 m2 g1 (N2, 77 K, BET method) was used as support,
which was previously calcined in air at 773 K for 5 h. Two
PtSn/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by a coimpregnation method
(C-PtSn/TiO2), with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl66H2O
(Johnson Matthey) of the appropriate concentration to achieve a
Pt content of 2 wt%, and SnCl22H2O (Aldrich). Catalysts with
nominal Pt:Sn atomic ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 were prepared. The
slurry (10 ml/g of support) was stirred for 12 h and then the
excess solvent was removed by heating at 363 K under vacuum
in a rotary evaporator. Finally, the catalysts were dried at 383 K
for 24 h and calcined under a ﬂow of synthetic air at 673 K for
4 h, with a heating rate of 5 8C/min.
Two more PtSn/TiO2 catalysts, with the same composition
as samples prepared by coimpregnation, were prepared by a
successive impregnation method (S-PtSn/TiO2). The support
was ﬁrst impregnated with an aqueous solution of SnCl22H2O
(Aldrich) and dried at 383 K overnight, and then it was
impregnated with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl66H2O
(Johnson Matthey). Drying and calcination treatments were
the same as described for the coimpregnated catalysts.
XPS spectra were acquired with a VG-Microtech Multilab
3000 spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron
analyzer
and
a

(hn = 1253.6 eV,
1 eV = 1.6302  1019 J) 300 W X-ray source. The powder
samples were pressed into small Inox cylinders and then
mounted on a sample rod placed in a pre-treatment chamber and
reduced in H2 for 1 h at 473 and 773 K before being transferred
to the analysis chamber. Before recording of spectra, the sample
was maintained in the analysis chamber until a residual
pressure of 5  109 mbar was reached. The spectra were
collected at a pass energy of 50 eV. The intensities were
estimated by calculating the integral of each peak, after
subtraction of the S-shaped background, and by ﬁtting the
experimental curve to a combination of Lorentzian (30%) and
Gaussian (70%) lines. Binding energies were referenced to the
Ti 2p3/2 line in TiO2 at 458.5 eV, which provide values with an
accuracy of 0.2 eV. The surface Pt/Ti and Pt/Sn ratios were
estimated from the integrated intensities, after correction for
atomic sensitivity factors [37].
FTIR experiments were carried out using a quartz cell ﬁtted
with CaF2 windows and an external furnace. Catalyst samples
were prepared as 16 mm diameter self-supporting disks by
pressing 70 mg of loose powder between polished steel dies at
15 MN m2. Prior to any measurements, samples were reduced
in situ under a hydrogen ﬂow (50 cm3 min1) at 473 or 773 K
for 1 h. After reduction, samples were out-gassed at the
reduction temperature for 15 min, to a ﬁnal pressure of
105 Torr, before cooling to ambient temperature. Pulses of
CO were introduced at 298 K using calibrated volumes and an
Edward active strain gauge to measure the pressure of the pulse.
FTIR spectra were recorded after each pulse without outgassing
at 4 cm1 resolution and averaging 25 scans per spectrum.
Microcalorimetric measurements were performed at 298 K
using a Setaram BT2.15D heat-ﬂux calorimeter. The calori-
meter was connected to a volumetric system employing a

pressure
measurement (0.001 Torr). The maximum leak rate of the
volumetric system (including the calorimetric cell) was
105 Torr min1 min in a system volume of approximately
60 cm3. The samples (between 0.3 and 0.8 g) were reduced ex
situ in high purity hydrogen (50 cm3 min1) at 473 or 773 K for
1 h. After reduction, samples were out-gassed at the reduction
temperature for 15 min, and then purged at the same
temperature for 1 h in high purity helium to remove any
adsorbed hydrogen. The samples were sealed in a Pyrex NMR
tube and placed in a special calorimetric cell. When thermal

equilibrium was reached, the capsule was broken, and small
pulses of CO were introduced until the catalyst became
saturated. The resulting heat response for each pulse was
recorded as a function of time and integrated to determine the
energy released. The differential heat (kJ mol1) was deﬁned as
the negative of the enthalpy change of adsorption per mole of
gas adsorbed.
The vapour-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (2-
butenal) was carried out in a micro-reactor at atmospheric
pressure operating under differential conditions. The catalysts
(between 0.01 and 0.03 g) were reduced in situ at 473 or 773 K
under ﬂowing H2 (50 cm3 min1) for 1 h and then cooled under
H2 to reaction temperature (333 K). The hydrogenation
reaction was carried out using a reaction mixture (total ﬂow:
50 cm3 min1; H2/aldehyde ratio of 26) of H2 and crotonalde-
hyde (Fluka, >99.5%), which was prepared by passing H2
through a thermo-stabilised saturator (293 K) containing
crotonaldehyde. The concentration of reactants and products
was determined by online GC with a Carbowax 20 M 58/90
semicapillary column.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XPS characterization
The binding energies of the Pt 4f7/2 and Sn 3d3/2 levels for
the catalysts reduced in situ at 473 and 773 K for 1 h are
reported in Table 1. In some cases two values are given, as a
result of the deconvolution of the main peak into two
contributions. The surface Pt/Ti atomic ratios are also presented
(which can be used as an estimation of the platinum dispersion
on the titania support), as well as the surface Pt/Sn atomic
ratios. Additionally, the relative amounts of oxidized tin species
(Snox/Sntotal), estimated from the integral of XPS peaks, are
also given.
The Pt 4f spectra for the S-PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) catalyst reduced
at 473 and 773 K are compared in Fig. 1. In this region, the
spectra show two peaks. The one at lower binding energy
corresponds to Pt 4f7/2 level and the second one, at higher
binding energies, to the Pt 4f5/2 level. For all catalysts, the peaks
are quite similar, and for the sake of brevity, only the Pt 4f
spectra for the catalyst S-PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) is shown and
discussed. When the sample was reduced at 473 K a single
peak, centred at 71.2 eV, appears for the Pt 4f7/2 level. This
value is characteristic of platinum in the metallic state. After
reduction at 773 K the peak is shifted to lower binding energy,
70.6 eV, and this can be attributed to several factors, such as a
decrease in the surface chloride levels or even metal sintering. It
should be noted that the intensity of the peak is lower when the
sample is reduced at higher temperature, indicative of a lower
amount of detectable surface platinum.
The Sn 3d5/2 spectra for the catalysts reduced at 473 and
773 K are plotted in Fig. 2. The spectra show a shift in the
binding energy towards lower values with increasing reduction
temperature, thus indicating the reduction of oxidized tin
species. One or two bands appear when the catalysts are
reduced at 473 K, which can be ascribed to tin in higher
oxidation states. Discrimination between Sn(II) and Sn(IV)
species with XPS is difﬁcult, as their binding energies are too
close; therefore they have been considered together as
‘‘oxidized tin species’’. The spectra for catalyst S-PtSn/TiO2
(1:1) shows a small band centred at 484.7 eV which does not
appear in the other catalysts after reduction at low temperature.
This contribution is attributed to reduced tin [11,38].

The spectra show a broadening of the Sn 3d5/2 peaks with
an increase in reduction temperature, with the appearance of a
shoulder at low binding energies. This facilitated deconvolu-
tion of the experimental spectra into two peaks; one at low
binding energy values, assigned to metallic tin, and the other
one at higher binding energies, attributed to oxidized tin
species. The surface composition of the bimetallic catalysts
reduced at 473 and at 773 K is different. Whereas platinum is
in metallic state after both reduction treatments, tin is in an
oxidized state when catalysts are reduced at 473 K, and in both
oxidized and metallic states after reduction at 773 K. The
presence of metallic tin in the catalysts reduced at 773 K opens
up the possibility for the existence of bimetallic Pt–Sn phases
after this treatment, although this cannot be readily assessed
by XPS.
After reduction at both temperatures, the Pt/Ti atomic ratio
of the catalysts decreases as the amount of tin decreases (see
Table 1). On the other hand, a decrease in this ratio is also
observed when the reduction temperature is increased for a
given catalysts that can be assigned to three main effects: (i)
dilution of platinum by metallic tin, upon the formation of Pt:Sn
bimetallic phases, (ii) covering of metal particles surface by
oxidized tin species and (iii) formation of partially reduced
titanium oxide, TiO2x, that can migrate onto the surface of the
metallic particles leading to partial decoration. By comparing
the different methods of preparation, it can be concluded that
higher dispersions are obtained, as determined by XPS, with the
coimpregnation method.
The Pt/Sn ratio decreases when the amount of tin increases,
and also after reduction at high temperature, which can be

attributed to the effects previously discussed. After reduction at
high temperature, catalysts prepared by successive impregnation
have a higher surface enrichment with tin species, which
probably indicates a close proximity between platinum and tin,
this favouring surface enrichment with tin species. On the other
hand, the surface Pt:Sn atomic ratio is, in all cases, lower than the
bulk one, thus indicating a surface segregation of tin species.
The ratio between the oxidized tin species and the total
amount of tin (Snox/Sntotal) shows that tin is all in an oxidized
state after reduction at 473 K, except for the S-PtSn/TiO2 (2:1)
catalyst where a small amount, ca. 4%, is in a metallic state.
After reduction at 773 K, a fraction of tin is in the metallic state.
The extent of tin reduction strongly depends on the preparation
method in samples with Pt:Sn atomic ratio of 1:1, for which the
sample prepared by the successive impregnation method has a
higher amount of metallic tin suggesting a greater extent of
interaction with platinum.
3.2. CO adsorption microcalorimetry
Table 2 reports the CO/Pt ratios obtained from CO
adsorption at room temperature on the different catalysts.
These values have been calculated by taking into account the
total platinum loading and assuming that no CO is adsorbed on
tin sites, as well as the CO uptake deduced from the amount of
CO adsorbed with a heat of adsorption higher than 40 kJ/mol.
Fig. 3 shows the differential heat of CO adsorption as a function
of the coverage at 298 K for catalysts reduced at 473 K. The
proﬁles for all catalysts are very similar. The initial heat of
adsorption is about 125 kJ/mol, but when the CO coverage
increases the value decreases, reaching a plateau at around
100 kJ/mol. The constant value of the plateau extends over a
wide range of coverage. At higher coverage there is a drastic
decrease in the differential heat of adsorption, which indicates a
saturation of the surface sites. The high initial heat of
adsorption can be attributed to a small amount of CO adsorbed
on low coordinated platinum atoms, as corners or edges [39],
and the plateau indicates an energetic homogeneity of the metal
atoms, giving a slight decrease in the heat of adsorption with
coverage, probably arising from interactions between neigh-
bouring CO molecules [40].
The CO uptakes for PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) catalysts are similar
(Table 2), being slightly higher for the catalyst prepared by
successive impregnation. However, between the PtSn/TiO2
(1:1) catalysts, the CO uptake for the catalyst prepared by
coimpregnation is more than twice that of its counterpart
prepared by successive impregnation. Chemisorption data are
not in good agreement with the Pt/Ti XPS atomic ratios
(Table 1), and these results could be explained by a partial
coverage of the metal particle surface by a thin layer of tin
oxide species. This thin layer would allow the photo-electrons
emitted from the underlying platinum atoms to be detected.
Different differential heat of adsorption proﬁles are obtained
after reduction at high temperature (Fig. 4). Catalysts with a
Pt:Sn atomic ratio of 2:1 showed similar heat-coverage proﬁles,
the initial heat of adsorption being about 140 kJ/mol, and the
heat of adsorption strongly decreasing with coverage, thus
indicating a heterogeneous distribution of active sites. The
saturation coverage for CO adsorption decreases when the

reduction temperature increases (Table 2), which correlates
with the atomic Pt/Ti ratios obtained by XPS. This loss in
adsorption capacity can be associated with the migration of
partially reduced titania particles to the platinum surface and a
diluting effect by formation of Pt:Sn bimetallic phases.
Catalysts with Pt:Sn atomic ratio of 1:1 reduced at 773 K
show
different
heat-coverage
proﬁles
depending
on
the
preparationmethod. Whereas thecatalystprepared bysuccessive
impregnation has the same proﬁle than catalysts discussed
previously, the catalyst prepared by coimpregnation has a lower
initial heat of adsorption (110 kJ/mol), which was maintained
until saturation of the surface. This suggests a higher
homogeneity of the surface metal atoms for CO adsorption
than their counterparts after reduction at high temperature. The
CO uptake decreases when compared with catalysts reduced at
473 K, which is ascribed to the effects previously discussed.
It is important to remark that the CO uptake (ca.
13 mmol g1) is similar for all catalysts reduced at high
temperature, and that it is independent of both the amount of tin
and the preparation method.
3.3. Infrared spectroscopy
Fig. 5 compares the FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed at room
temperature on the PtSn/TiO2 catalysts, after in situ reduction at
473 K. In all cases, catalysts were exposed at 298 K to
increasing CO doses until reaching 50 Torr, followed by
evacuation under high vacuum for 1 h at 298 K. All spectra
exhibit bands in the 2150–2000 cm1 region, which are
assigned to CO linearly adsorbed on the different metallic sites
[41,42]. For PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) catalysts (Fig. 5a), the spectrum
obtained after introduction of a CO dose of less than 0.1 Torr
contains only a broad band centred at 2073 cm1 and a shoulder
around 2040 cm1. An increase in the CO pressure produces a
blue shift of the main band, which is at 2083 cm1 at the highest
coverage, as well as an increase in the intensity of all bands. The

bands are composed of two or more contributions, with the
relative intensity of the highest frequency component being
enhanced to a greater extent by an increase in the CO pressure.
A broad band is observed at 1900 cm1 due to bridge-bonded
CO. There is also a band centred at 2188 cm1, which is
assigned to CO adsorbed on the support [43], and which readily
disappears after evacuation at 298 K.
The FTIR spectra of PtSn/TiO2 (1:1) catalysts reduced at
473 K (Fig. 5b) showed the same features as those discussed
previously, although the greater amount of tin produced a shift
to lower band positions for CO on linear sites (to 2070 cm1 at
low coverage and 2078 cm1 at the highest coverage). The
band attributed to bridge-bonded CO was less prominent for
catalysts with a higher amount of tin.
After reduction at 773 K, the band due to linearly adsorbed
CO is detected at lower wavenumbers when compared to
catalysts reduced at 473 K (Fig. 6). Spectra of PtSn/TiO2 (2:1)
catalysts showed, at low coverage, a maximum in intensity at
2065 cm1. As in the previous spectra, it is followed by a
shoulder at 2040 cm1. At the highest coverage, the band is
blue shifted to 2080 and 2072 cm1 for the coimpregnation and
successive impregnation catalysts, respectively. Bands at lower
wavenumbers were found for CO adsorption on PtSn/TiO2 (1:1)
catalysts, the bands being centred at 2056 and 2062 cm1 for
coimpregnation and successive impregnation catalysts, respec-
tively, at low coverage, and 2066 at the highest coverage.
The band due to bridge-bonded CO was not detected after
reduction at high temperature. Nevertheless, two bands appear
at high CO coverage, at 2208 and 2188 cm1, which correspond
to CO adsorbed on partially reduced titania and unreduced
titania, respectively. These bands disappear after evacuation
under vacuum at 298 K.
Comparing these results with previous studies on mono-
metallic Pt/TiO2 catalysts [43,44] after reduction at 473 K, it
can be concluded that the effect of tin addition was to shift the
dominant band due to CO linearly adsorbed to lower
wavenumbers, and this is consistent with previous results on
PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts [45,46]. Bands can be assigned by
reference
to
single
crystal
studies
and
by
considering
coordination number and the number of neighbouring sites
likely to result in coupling interactions [42,47,48]. The highest
wavenumber band observed can be attributed to CO linearly
adsorbed on terrace sites with low extension or where the metal
atoms are in a less dense close packing arrangement such as in
(1 0 0) facets. These results can be rationalised by a geometric
effect, assuming that tin oxide species are partially covering the
surface of the particles of platinum, thus reducing the coupling
interactions between molecules adsorbed on terraces. The
contribution at 2040 cm1 probably reﬂects sites located at
edges and kinks [41,42,47,49].
The band at 1900 cm1 appears at a high wavenumber for
bridged CO on Pt catalysts [41,50]. This effect can be ascribed
to the inﬂuence of Cl-adatoms from the metallic precursors for
Pt2CO involving adjacent pairs of reduced Pt atoms which have
been rendered cationic by e-withdrawal [46]. The intensity of
the band decreases with the amount of tin loaded, suggesting
the presence of tin species on exposed platinum surface that can
block bridging Pt–Pt sites.
The spectra were similar for all catalysts reduced at 473 K.
However, in the case of S-PtSn/TiO2 (1:1) catalysts, the band of
linearly adsorbed CO does not shift to higher wavenumbers
when the coverage is increased (Fig. 6b). This would be
consistent with a geometric effect due to the formation of a Pt–
Sn alloy phase. This tin in a metallic state would make a
dilution of the surface platinum atoms, removing the number of
dipolar coupling interactions of each Pt–CO [45,51]. This
would be in agreement with XPS results, where a small part of
tin in metallic state was detected.
After reduction at 773 K (Fig. 6), as in the catalyst discussed
previously, the band attributed to linearly adsorbed CO was not
shifted with increasing coverage, which suggest that CO is
adsorbed at platinum sites in the surface of Pt–Sn alloy particles
[45,52]. Nevertheless, a shift to higher wavenumbers is
observed at high coverage, therefore, not all the surface
platinum are involved in forming the Pt:Sn alloy phase(s). For
catalysts prepared by coimpregnation the shift is greater, which
suggests that a higher proportion of unalloyed platinum is
present as compared to successive impregnation catalysts.
These results were accompanied by a red shift of the band

position when compared to the catalysts reduced at 473 K. This
is consistent with an electronic effect, where the platinum in Pt–
Sn alloy is less electron deﬁcient than free platinum [53,54].
Therefore, tin addition should contribute to a shift of the band to
lower wavenumbers.
A decrease in the band intensities is also observed after
reduction at 773 K, as well as the disappearance of the band
corresponding to bridge-bonded CO. The former observation
correlates with the decrease observed in the CO chemisorption
capacity; it cannot be ascribed to the sintering of metal
particles, as larger particles would yield a higher proportion of
CO adsorbed on close packed terrace sites, resulting in a shift to
higher wavenumbers and a blue shift with increasing CO
coverage due to dipolar coupling effects [45]. XPS results have
shown that, upon reduction at high temperature (773 K), both
the Pt/Ti and the Pt/Sn surface atomic ratios decrease with
regard to those obtained after reduction at low (473 K)
temperature. Furthermore, a given amount of oxidized tin
species is reduced to metallic tin, this opening the possibility to
the formation of Pt–Sn alloys. Thus, the observed results (lower
intensity of IR CO bands and lose of bridge-bonded CO after
reduction at 773 K) can be assigned to a combination of at least,
three facts: (i) migration of partially reduced titania to the
surface of metallic particles, (ii) covering of metal particle by
oxidized tin, and (iii) dilution of surface platinum atoms by the
formation of Pt–Sn alloy phases.
3.4. Crotonaldehyde hydrogenation
The evolution of catalytic activity (mmoles of crotonalde-
hyde transformed per second per gram of platinum) as a
function of time on stream at 333 K for catalysts reduced at
473 K is plotted in Fig. 7a. Data are reported after carbon
balance was achieved, since no reliable data can be assessed
when reactant and products were adsorbed during the initial
stages of the reaction. The behaviour was similar in all cases;
the activity drastically decreases during the ﬁrst 25–50 min,
thereafter remaining practically stable as a function of time on
stream. Catalysts prepared by coimpregnation have the highest
activities, following the order C-PtSn/TiO2 (1:1) > C-PtSn/
TiO2 (2:1) > S-PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) > S-PtSn/TiO2 (1:1) where the
activities at the end of the reaction are considered.
In all cases, reduction at 773 K produces an increase in
activity (Fig. 8a), as reported in the literature [11]. It is
important to remark that for catalysts with a higher tin loading,
PtSn/TiO2 (1:1), the increase in activity is greater. Comparing
activities at the end of the reaction, the activities are 15.7 and
8.3 times higher than after reduction at 473 K for C-PtSn/TiO2
(1:1) and S-PtSn/TiO2 (1:1) catalysts, respectively, and 5.4 and
1.6 times higher for catalysts C-PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) and S-PtSn/
TiO2 (2:1), respectively.
Taking into account the XPS, CO chemisorption and FTIR
data, reduction at 773 K causes a decrease in the number of
surface active sites. This suggests that the remaining surface
platinum atoms are much more active. The presence, after
reduction at high temperature, of tin oxide and partially reduced
patches of titania decorating surface platinum particles, and the
formation of Pt–Sn alloy, suggested by FTIR, were potential
reasons for the promoting effect after reduction at high
temperature. Tin oxide and partially reduced titania act as
electrophilic centres or Lewis acid sites interacting with the
oxygen atom of the carbonyl function, and this interaction
weakens the C O bond, that becomes more reactive toward
hydrogenation [31,55]. On the other hand, a change in the
electronic state of platinum is induced by alloying with tin, and
this change inﬂuences the bond strength between the bond
adsorbed species and the surface [56]. It was reported that such
hydrogenation reactions occurred faster on surface with
decreased electron density [57].
In the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, a molecule
containing
two
conjugated
double
bonds,
two
primary
hydrogenation routes can take place: (i) the hydrogenation
of the oleﬁnic C C bond to yield butanal and (ii) the
hydrogenation of the C O bond to yield crotyl alcohol. These
compounds can be further hydrogenated to produce butanol and
butane, and crotyl alcohol can also isomerise to butanal.

(1:1) () catalysts reduced at 473 K.

242
Moreover, decarbonylation and cracking could also take place,
yielding light hydrocarbons (C1–3). The extend of the secondary
reactions depends on the total conversion; therefore, the
selectivity toward crotyl alcohol usually decreases when the
conversion increases [12,14,30].
In this study, the only reaction products detected were
butanal, crotyl alcohol and a small amount of butane and
butanol. Fig. 7b compares the selectivity toward crotyl alcohol
as a function of time on stream for the PtSn/TiO2 catalysts
reduced at 473 K. For catalysts prepared by successive
impregnation, the selectivity remains constant with the time
on stream, whereas for catalysts prepared by coimpregnation
there is an increase in selectivity during the ﬁrst minutes of
reaction, reaching a nearly constant value. This may be because
at the ﬁrst minutes of reaction, the conversion is very high, and
a given part of crotyl alcohol is hydrogenated to butanol.
Selectivity towards crotyl alcohol after reduction at 473 K has
a strong dependence on the preparation method. Whereas
selectivity for catalysts prepared by the successive impregnation
method was similar in both cases (around 37%), a higher value
was obtained for catalysts prepared by coimpregnation (44 and
52% for C-PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) and C-PtSn/TiO2 (1:1), respectively).
Bearing in mind that after this treatment no SMSI effect is
expected, and that Pt–Sn alloy formation was not detected by
XPS and IR spectroscopy, a greater amount of oxidized tin
species on the metal particles is suggested to account for this
promoting effect. Oxidized tin species, which interact with the
oxygen atom of the carbonyl bond, can weaken the bond and
favour hydrogenation.
The evolution of the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol as a
function of time on stream when the catalysts are reduced at
high temperature (773 K) is quite similar (Fig. 8b). The
selectivity toward crotyl alcohol remains practically constant
with time on stream. For all catalysts, the selectivity towards
crotyl alcohol was increased as compared to that obtained when
catalysts were reduced at low temperature (473 K), except for
the catalyst with atomic ratio Pt:Sn = 2:1, for which the
selectivity remained practically constant. First, the enhance-
ment in the selectivity toward crotyl alcohol could be explained
by the formation of new sites at the metal-partially reduced
titania support and metal–tin oxidized species that activate the
carbonyl bond and favour hydrogenation. On the other hand,
the creation of Pt–Sn alloy would decrease the number of sites
which are able to hydrogenate the C C bond. These sites are
unmodiﬁed or slightly modiﬁed platinum ensembles, and the
formation of Pt–Sn alloy would destroy them, slowing down the
rate of C C hydrogenation [14].
Inthiscase,theselectivitytowardcrotylalcoholisnotaffected
by the preparation mode, but it increases with the amount of tin
(Fig. 8b), which reveals the important role of both the formation
of Pt–Sn alloy and the existence of oxidized tin species on the
platinum particles, although it cannot be clearly assessed which
effect is more relevant for the selectivity toward crotyl alcohol.
The overall conversion was held within the range from 2 to
10%. Nevertheless, there are no important changes in the
selectivity towards crotyl alcohol with conversion.
4. Conclusions
This study compares the catalytic behaviour of PtSn/TiO2
catalysts prepared by successive impregnation or coimpregna-
tion on the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde after
reduction at 473 and 773 K. Results show a pronounced
inﬂuence of the method of preparation on the catalytic
properties. The catalysts prepared by coimpregnation have
higher activities and selectivities toward crotyl alcohol than
their counterparts prepared by successive impregnation after
reduction at 473 K, which is attributed to the presence of
oxidized tin species on the surface of the metal particles. XPS,
CO chemisorption and infrared results show that reduction at
773 K decreased the number of exposed platinum sites, but
activities and selectivities were improved. The decoration of
platinum particles with partially reduced titania and oxidized
tin species, and the formation of Pt–Sn alloy are suggested as
the origin of these effects. As in the case of reduction at low
temperature, the activity of catalysts prepared by coimpregna-

tion was also higher after reduction at 773 K although in this
case, the selectivity toward crotyl alcohol was not affected by
the preparation mode. However, the selectivity was increased
with tin loading, which reveal the importance of tin in these
systems both in the oxidized and in the metallic states.
