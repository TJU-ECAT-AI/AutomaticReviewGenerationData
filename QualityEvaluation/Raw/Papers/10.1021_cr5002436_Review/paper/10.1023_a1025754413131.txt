Abstract
The dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported gallium oxide catalyst was investigated at temperatures ranging from 793 to 853 K under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst was found to be moderately active and highly selective to propene in the dehydrogenation of propane. The amount of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst in the dehydrogenation was around 1/10th of that on a silica-supported chromium oxide catalyst. Lower reaction temperatures and lower concentrations of propane in the feed would be favorable for selective production of propene.
