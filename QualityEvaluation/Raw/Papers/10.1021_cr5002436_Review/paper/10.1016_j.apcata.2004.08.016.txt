Abstract
The Sn(0.3 or 0.5 wt.%) addition to Pt(0.3 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4 and Pt(0.3 wt.%)/MgAl2O4 catalysts leads to an increase of the activity and
selectivity to oleﬁns in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction. Slight differences in the catalytic behaviour were found between 0.3 and
0.5 wt.% of Sn added to Pt in both catalyst series. Besides, the bimetallic catalysts also show a good stability through the ﬁve successive
reaction-regeneration cycles, mainly the PtSn/MgAl2O4 one. The mono- and bimetallic catalysts were characterized by using different
techniques: tests reactions of the metallic phase (cyclohexane dehydrogenation and cyclopentane hydrogenolysis), temperature
programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, H2 chemisorption, microcalorimetric measurements of the propylene
adsorption and XRD. Results show that the nature of the metallic phase in monometallic samples appears to be different for the
two supports. Thus, metallic particles with a very low concentration of hydrogenolytic sites (steps, corners and edges) would exist in the
Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst in contrast with the structure of the metallic phase of the Pt/MgAl2O4 one, where the existence of an important
concentration of hydrogenolytic sites is clearly observed (according to the cyclopentane hydrogenolysis results). The modiﬁcation of Pt
by the Sn addition clearly improves the catalytic behaviour in n-butane dehydrogenation due to important changes in the structure of the
metallic phase. Thus, when Sn is added to Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts the metallic surface structure seems to be more complex.
In fact, results would indicate not only a partial formation of PtSn alloys or intermetallic compounds between Pt0 and a fraction of Sn(0),
but also a surface enrichment in Sn, dilution effects as well as the presence of tin stabilized on the support, probably as Sn(II/IV) oxides
and SnCl2 species.

1. Introduction
Bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4
have been found to be active and selective for the direct
dehydrogenation of light parafﬁns. In fact, Padro
´ et al. [1,2]
found a very high selectivity to propylene (with values close
to 97%) in the propane dehydrogenation for PtSn/ZnAl2O4
and PtGe/ZnAl2O4 catalysts. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts
used by Padro
´ et al. [1] also showed a good catalytic
stability. At this respect, Rennard and Freel [3] found that the
Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst maintained a good Pt dispersion after
several reaction-oxidation cycles (in propane and isopentane
dehydrogenation reactions). Armendariz et al. [4] reported a
good selectivity of PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalysts in the iso-
pentane dehydrogenation to isoamilenes. Bosch et al. [5] and
Aguilar-Rı
´os et al. [6] also showed a good performance of Pt
and PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 in isobutane
dehydrogenation. Taking into account these behaviors, it
would be also possible to use these supports in catalysts for
dehydrogenation of linear parafﬁns with high molecular
weight in order to produce the corresponding mono-oleﬁns.

It must also be indicated that oleﬁns have a very wide
application in the production of polymers, intermediaries for
detergents and additives for gasoline (MTBE) [7,8].
The use of ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 as a support of PtSn is
based on their neutral characteristics and very high thermal
stability. The ﬁrst characteristic is very important in parafﬁn
dehydrogenation processes since a very high selectivity to
oleﬁns depends not only on adequate structure of the
metallic phase but also on the low acidity of the support in
order to minimize the undesirable lateral reactions (such as
cracking and coke formation) [1,5].
One of the more relevant aspects in the study of these
bimetallic systems is related to the knowledge of the
structure of the metallic phase and its relationship with the
catalytic behavior in the dehydrogenation of light parafﬁns,
and with the methods used for the preparation of the support
and the deposition of the metallic precursors. In fact,
important aspects have not completely analyzed in the
literature, viz, the probable alloy or intermetallic PtSn
compounds formation [9], dilution effects of Pt by Sn, the
interaction of the metallic phase with the support, the
oxidation state of Sn, as well as the relationship between the
catalytic stability and the modiﬁcation of the structure of the
metallic phase through successive reaction-regeneration
cycles. Some investigations on the relationship between the
surface structure and the catalytic behavior were reported in
the literature for other bimetallic systems and reactions
[10,11]. In consequence, the objective of this paper is to
determine the effect of the Sn addition (0.3 and 0.5 wt.%) to
Pt(0.3 wt.%) supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 over the
catalytic performance (activity, selectivity, catalyst deacti-
vation and stability) in the n-butane dehydrogenation
reaction, which was carried out in ﬂow and pulse
equipments. It should be indicated that low Sn loadings
were selected for this study since, according to the literature,
the
addition
of
higher
amounts
of
Sn(1 wt.%)
to
Pt(0.5 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4 would produce the inhibition of the
dehydrogenation activity [5]. Besides, a comparative study
of the structure of the metallic phase of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 and
PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalysts with low metal loadings (Pt:
0.3 wt.% and Sn: 0.3–0.5 wt.%) was performed. For this
purpose, several characterization techniques were used: test
reactions of the metallic phase (cyclohexane dehydrogena-
tion and cyclopentane hydrogenolysis), temperature pro-
grammed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, H2
chemisorption, microcalorimetric measurements of the
propylene adsorption and X-ray diffraction.
2. Experimental
Two supports were used for the preparation of catalysts:
ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4, which were synthesized following
the technique reported by Strohmeier and Hercules [12]. In
both cases, pure g-Al2O3 was mixed with a stoichiometric
amount of ZnO (from AnalaR, 99.9%) or MgO (from Alfa,
99.995%). These mixtures were ground to a very ﬁne
powder and then a small amount of deionized water was
added in order to obtain a paste, which was ﬁrst dried at
373 K for 6 h, and then subjected to a thermal treatment in an
electric furnace at 1173 K for 72 h. Finally, the solid was
ground to 35–80 mesh. In order to eliminate the excess of
ZnO (or MgO), samples were submitted to an extraction
treatment at room temperature with ﬁve portions of an
aqueous solution of (NH4)2CO3 (1 M). After the extraction
procedure, the solid was separated from the liquid and dried
at 383 K. The puriﬁed solid samples were X-ray diffracted
(XRD) to conﬁrm the elimination of the excess of ZnO or
MgO species.
The textural properties of ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 were
determined in a Quantachrome Corporation NOVA 1000
surface area analyser, the SBET values being 9.2 m2 g1 for
ZnAl2O4 and 37 m2 g1 for MgAl2O4.
Monometallic Pt(0.3 wt.%) catalysts were prepared by
impregnation of the corresponding support with an aqueous
solution of H2PtCl6. For the impregnation of ZnAl2O4 and
MgAl2O4, the Pt concentrations in the impregnating
solutions were 4.3 and 2.15 g l1, respectively, and the
impregnating volume/support weight ratios were 0.7 and
1.4 ml g1, respectively. In both cases the impregnations
were carried out at room temperature for 6 h. Sn(0.5 wt.%)
monometallic catalysts were prepared by impregnation of
the corresponding support with a hydrochloric solution of
SnCl2 using the above mentioned impregnation volume/
support weight ratios. The Sn concentrations in the
impregnating solutions were such as to obtain the desired
Sn loading. After the impregnation, all the samples were
dried at 383 K for 12 h.
The
bimetallic
catalysts:
Pt(0.3 wt.%)Sn(0.3 wt.%)/
ZnAl2O4, Pt(0.3 wt.%)Sn(0.5 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4, Pt(0.3 wt.%)-
Sn(0.3 wt.%)/MgAl2O4
and
Pt(0.3 wt.%)Sn(0.5 wt.%)/
MgAl2O4 were obtained by impregnating the monome-
tallic ones with a hydrochloric solution (1.2 M HCl) of
SnCl2. The Sn concentrations in the solutions were 4.28
and 7.14 g l1 for the impregnation of Pt/ZnAl2O4 with 0.3
and 0.5 wt.% Sn, respectively. In the case of the
impregnation of the Pt/MgAl2O4 with Sn, the concentra-
tions were 2.14 g Sn l1 for 0.3 wt.% Sn and 3.57 g Sn l1
for 0.5 wt.% Sn. The ratio between the volume of the
SnCl2 solution and the weight of monometallic catalyst
was 0.7 ml g1 for Pt/ZnAl2O4 and 1.4 ml g1 for Pt/
MgAl2O4. After the impregnation with the tin solution
(6 h, 298 K), samples were dried at 383 K overnight. Then,
mono- and bimetallic catalysts were calcined at 773 K for
3 h. These samples were labeled as fresh catalysts.
Two different n-butane dehydrogenation tests were
carried out, one of them in a continuous ﬂow reactor and
the other one in a pulse equipment. The continuous ﬂow
experiments were performed at 803 K during 2 h in a quartz
ﬂow reactor heated by an electric furnace. The reactor (with
a catalyst weight of 0.200 g) was fed with 18 ml min1 of
the reactive mixture (n-butane + hydrogen, H2/n-C4H10
S.A. Bocanegra et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 277 (2004) 11–22

molar ratio = 1.25). The reactive mixture was prepared ‘‘in
situ’’ by using mass ﬂow controllers. All gases, n-butane, N2
(used for purge), and H2 (used for the previous reduction of
catalysts and for the reaction) were high purity ones
(>99.99%). Prior to the reaction, catalysts were reduced ‘‘in
situ’’ at 803 K under ﬂowing H2 for 3 h. The reactor efﬂuent
was analysed in a GC-FID equipment with a packed
chromatographic column (1/8 in.  6 m, 20% BMEA on
Chromosorb P-AW 60/80), which was kept at 323 K during
the analysis. With this analytical device, the amounts of
methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, n-butane, 1-
butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene and 1,3-butadiene were
measured. The n-butane conversion was calculated as the
sum of the percentages of the chromatographic areas of
all the reaction products (except H2) corrected by the
corresponding response factor. The selectivity to the
different reaction products (i) was deﬁned as the ratio:
mol of product i= P mol of all products (except H2). Taking
into account the high temperatures used for the reaction (for
thermodynamic reasons), it was necessary to determine the
contribution of the homogeneous reaction. For this purpose,
a blank experiment was performed by using a quartz bed and
the results showed a negligible n-butane conversion (1%).
The pulse experiments were performed by injecting
pulses of pure n-butane (0.5 ml STP) into the catalytic bed
(0.100 g of sample) at 803 K. The catalytic bed was kept
under ﬂowing He (30 ml min1) between the injection of
two successive pulses. Prior to the experiments, all samples
were reduced ‘‘in situ’’ under ﬂowing H2 at 803 K for 3 h.
The composition of each pulse after the reaction was
determined by using a GC-FID equipment with a packed
column (Porapack Q). The temperature of the chromato-
graphic column was 303 K. In these experiments the n-
butane conversion was calculated as the difference between
the chromatographic area of n-butane fed to the reactor and
the chromatographic area of non-reacted n-butane at the
outlet of the reactor, and this difference was referred to the
chromatographic area of n-butane fed to the reactor. The
selectivity to a given product was calculated in the same way
than for ﬂow experiments. The carbon amount retained on
the catalyst after the injection of each pulse was calculated
through a mass balance between the total carbon amount fed
to the reactor and the total carbon amount detected by the
chromatographic analysis at outlet of the reactor. The
accumulative carbon retention was calculated as the sum of
the carbon amount retained after each pulse.
Besides the above mentioned test in n-butane dehy-
drogenation, studies on the catalytic stability of the
bimetallic PtSn(0.3 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4 and PtSn(0.3 wt.%)/
MgAl2O4 catalysts were carried out. These stability
experiments consisted on ﬁve reaction-regeneration cycles.
Each sequence was: reaction (at 803 K, 6 h), purge with N2,
regeneration with a O2–N2 mixture (5% (v/v) O2) at 773 K
for 6 h, purge with N2 and reduction with H2 at 803 K. The
purge steps with N2 were performed at 673 K for 30 min.
The catalyst weight (0.500 g) used in these experiments was
higher than that of the ﬂow experiments in order to magnify
the thermal effects during the reaction, the regeneration
(carbon burn-off, a very exothermic reaction) and the
reduction (an exothermic reaction) steps.
The characteristics of the metallic catalysts were
determined by different techniques: test reactions of the
metallic phase (cyclohexane dehydrogenation and cyclo-
pentane hydrogenolysis), temperature programmed reduc-
tion (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), H2
chemisorption and microcalorimetric measurements of the
propylene adsorption.
Cyclohexane dehydrogenation (CHD) and cyclopentane
hydrogenolysis (CPH) were carried out in a differential ﬂow
reactor. Prior to these reactions, samples were reduced ‘‘in
situ’’ with H2 at the same temperature as the reaction was
carried out. In both reactions the H2/hydrocarbon molar ratio
was 26. The reaction temperatures in CHD were 573 K for
the catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 and 673 K for ZnAl2O4-
based ones, whereas in CPH the temperature was 773 K for
both catalyst series.
TPR experiments were performed in a quartz ﬂow
reactor. The samples (fresh and after ﬁve reaction-
regeneration cycles) were heated at 6 K min1 from room
temperature up to about 900 K. The reductive mixture (5%
(v/v) H2–N2) was fed to the reactor with a ﬂow rate of
10 ml min1. Catalysts were previously calcined ‘‘in situ’’ at
773 K for 3 h.
XPS measurements were carried out in a VG-Microtech
Multilab spectrometer, which operates with an energy power
of 50 eV (radiation Mg Ka, hn = 1253.6 eV). The pressure
of the analysis chamber was kept at 4  1010 Torr. Samples
were previously reduced ‘‘in situ’’ at 803 K with H2 for 2 h.
Binding energies (BE) were referred to the C1s peak at
284.9 eV. The peak areas were estimated by ﬁtting the
experimental results with Lorentzian–Gaussian curves.
H2
chemisorption
measurements
were
made
in
a
volumetric equipment. The sample was heated under
ﬂowing H2 (60 ml min1) from room temperature up to
773 K, and then kept at this temperature for 4 h. Then, the
sample was outgassed under vacuum (104 Torr) for 1 h.
After the sample was cooled down to room temperature
(298 K), the hydrogen dosage was performed in the range
50–250 Torr.
Microcalorimetric
measurements
of
the
propylene
adsorption were carried out in a differential heat-ﬂow
microcalorimeter of the Tian-Calvet type (Setaram C80 II)
operated under isothermal conditions. Samples contained
into glass adsorption vessels were placed in the calorimeter.
These vessels are linked to a volumetric apparatus that let the
injection of successive small pulses of propylene. The
equilibrium
pressure was
measured
by
means
of
a
capacitance manometer (MKS Baratron 627). The tempera-
ture of the propylene adsorption was kept constant at 330 K.
Catalysts were previously reduced ‘‘in situ’’ under ﬂowing
hydrogen at 773 K for 2 h, then outgassed at the same
temperature for 16 h and ﬁnally cooled down to 330 K.

Afterwards, successive pulses of propylene were injected
into the catalyst bed. The differential adsorption heats were
obtained as the ratio between the exothermic heat value of
each pulse and the adsorbed propylene amount. It is
considered that the propylene monolayer is reached when
the heat evolved falls in the physisorption ﬁeld (40 kJ
mol1). The calorimetric and volumetric data were stored
and processed with a microcomputer.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Test in n-butane dehydrogenation
Table 1 shows the initial n-butane conversion (X0,
measured at 10 min of the reaction time) and ﬁnal values of
the n-butane conversion (Xf, measured at 120 min of the
reaction time) both obtained from ﬂow experiments for
mono- and bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and
MgAl2O4. It can be observed that the Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst
shows a very low n-butane conversion (about 5%) and this
value is practically constant through the reaction, while the
Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst shows a higher initial conversion
(21%). When Sn is added to the Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst the
initial activities sharply increase reaching values close to
30% for both Sn contents. In a similar way, the Sn addition to
the Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst also increases the initial n-butane
conversion.
Table 1 also shows the initial (S0) and ﬁnal (Sf) values of
the selectivity to all butenes (1-butene, cis- and trans-2-
butenes, and 1,3-butadiene) for mono- and bimetallic
catalysts supported both on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4. It
can be observed that the initial selectivity of the Pt/ZnAl2O4
catalyst is about 73%, and then it increases reaching a value
of 92% at the ﬁnal reaction time. In the case of the Pt/
MgAl2O4 catalyst, the initial selectivity is about 77% and
then it slightly increases up to a ﬁnal value of 82%. When Sn
is added to the Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst, the initial selectivity to
butenes is 94% for 0.5 wt.% of Sn and about 98% for
0.3 wt.% Sn. In the case of PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalysts, initial
and ﬁnal selectivity values to butenes range between 95 and
98%. The ﬁnal selectivity values were similar for both
catalyst series. It should be also noted that when the Sn
loading increases from 0.3 up to 0.5 wt.%, the selectivities to
butenes are slightly modiﬁed for the bimetallic catalysts
supported either on MgAl2O4 or ZnAl2O4.
Concerning to the deactivation parameter, DX, deﬁned as
100  (X0  Xf)/X0 (where X0 and Xf are the initial and ﬁnal
conversions, respectively), it can be observed a very low
deactivation for the Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst. However, this
sample shows a very low initial activity which is practically
constant through the reaction. This behaviour could be due
to the higher catalyst deactivation by coke deposition that
could take place during the ﬁrst minutes of the reaction. The
effect of the initial deactivation by coke deposition can be
better explained at the light of the pulse experiment results,
as it will be analyzed below. On the other hand, the Pt/
MgAl2O4 catalyst displays a very pronounced deactivation
parameter (about 41%). When Sn is added to the Pt/
MgAl2O4 catalyst, the deactivation parameter clearly
decreases with respect to that of the monometallic one,
mainly
for
0.3 wt.%
Sn.
Table
1
also
shows
that
PtSn(0.3 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4 and PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4 cat-
alysts display similar deactivation parameter values. It can
also be observed in Table 1 that the initial (Y0) and ﬁnal (Yf)
yields to all butenes (deﬁned as the product between the n-
butane conversion and the selectivity to all butenes) for the
PtSn(0.3 wt.%) catalysts supported on both supports are
slightly higher than the corresponding yields for catalysts
with a higher Sn content (0.5 wt.%).
Eight pulses of pure n-butane were injected on each
sample during the pulse experiments. Results of the n-butane
conversion (X) as a function of the pulse number are
indicated in Table 2. It can be observed that both
monometallic catalysts display a high n-butane conversion
after the injection of the ﬁrst pulse. It is worth noticing that
the initial activities of the monometallic catalysts in ﬂow
experiments are clearly lower than those of the bimetallic
ones, mainly for the Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst, whereas the initial
activities (ﬁrst pulse) of the monometallic catalysts in pulse
experiments are slightly higher than for the corresponding
bimetallic ones (Table 2). The apparent increase of the initial
activity for PtSn catalysts observed in ﬂow experiments with
respect to the monometallic ones can be explained by
considering the results obtained in pulse experiments,
mainly those of the relative carbon retention (RCR: deﬁned
as the accumulative carbon amount deposited after the
injection of i pulses referred to the total carbon amount

deposited on the corresponding monometallic catalyst after
the injection of eight pulses). It can be observed in Table 2
that the relative carbon retentions after the injection of the
ﬁrst pulse for monometallic catalysts are not much different
with respect to the bimetallic catalysts. However, the relative
carbon retentions after the injection of eight pulses of n-
butane for monometallic catalysts are clearly higher than for
the corresponding bimetallic ones. It should be considered
that the injection of the ﬁrst pulse of n-butane is produced on
a clean surface (carbon free), while the ﬁrst n-butane
conversion point obtained in the ﬂow experiment (at 10 min
of the reaction time) corresponds to the reaction of n-butane
on a partially deactivated surface by carbon deposition.
Hence, taking into account the RCR values shown in Table 2,
it is observed that the deactivation by coke deposition is
more important for monometallic catalysts than for the
bimetallic ones after the injection of the eight pulses of n-
butane. In consequence, it can be expected a higher initial
activity in bimetallic catalysts than for the monometallic
ones at 10 min of the reaction time in ﬂow experiments.

experiments, Fig. 1a and b show that the selectivity slowly

increases as the pulse number increases. By comparing Fig.
1a and b, it can be observed that the hydrogenolytic capacity
of Pt/MgAl2O4 is clearly higher than that of the Pt/ZnAl2O4
one. These behaviors are supported by the CPH reaction
results, as it will be shown below. Besides, the Sn addition to
Pt leads to an important increase of the selectivity to butenes
(in pulse experiments), mainly for catalysts supported on
MgAl2O4. It can be also observed that after the eighth pulse,
the selectivity to butenes tends to reach a similar value for
both Sn contents in the two catalysts series which agrees
with the behaviour observed in ﬂow experiments.
The results of the stability experiments are condensed in
Figs. 2a, b and 3. Thus, Fig. 2a and b show the modiﬁcation
of the initial and ﬁnal activities (n-butane conversion) and
selectivities to all butenes for PtSn(0.3 wt.%)/MgAl2O4 and
for PtSn(0.3 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4 catalysts, respectively, through
the ﬁve successive reaction-regeneration cycles. It can be
observed that the PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst shows a slight
modiﬁcation of the initial activity between the ﬁrst and the
ﬁfth cycle. On the other hand, the decrease of the initial
activity between the ﬁrst and the ﬁfth cycle for the PtSn/
ZnAl2O4 catalyst is clearly higher than for the PtSn/
MgAl2O4 catalyst. In what the selectivity to all butenes it
respects, it can be concluded that both PtSn/ZnAl2O4 and
PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalysts display initial selectivity values
(ﬁrst cycle) of about 90% (Fig. 2a and b). Besides, the initial
selectivity to all butenes displays a low modiﬁcation through
the successive cycles for the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst. In the
case of the PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst, it can be observed a
certain decrease of the initial selectivity to butenes through
the successive cycles. In order to obtain a better comparison
of the performance of both catalysts, the initial and ﬁnal
yields to all butenes for the different cycles were calculated
as the product between the n-butane conversion and the
selectivity to all butenes, and the results are shown in Fig. 3.
The initial yield to butenes for the PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst is
slightly modiﬁed through the successive cycles, and the ﬁnal
yield slowly decreases from 26% (ﬁrst cycle) to 22% (ﬁfth
cycle). It can be also observed that the yield to butenes for
the bimetallic catalyst supported on MgAl2O4 is clearly
higher than for the bimetallic one supported on ZnAl2O4
through the successive cycles. In conclusion, these results
indicate that the PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst is more stable than
the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 one through the successive reaction-
regeneration cycles.
3.2. Test reactions
Experiments of cyclohexane (CH) dehydrogenation were
carried out on mono- and bimetallic catalysts supported on

perature: 803 K.
MgAl2O4 and ZnAl2O4 at 573 and 673 K, respectively, and
the results are shown in Table 3. Catalysts supported on
ZnAl2O4 were evaluated in this reaction at 673 K due to the
negligible activity displayed at 573 K. The CH conversion
for catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 at 673 K was very high
(10%) and under this condition the behaviour of the
reactor is far from the differential ﬂow reactor model, thus
avoiding the correct measurement of the activation energy.
Hence, the temperature selected for the CHD reaction on
catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 was 573 K. Table 3 shows
that there is an important decrease of the initial reaction rate
and an increase of the activation energy for CHD reaction
after the Sn addition to the Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst. In the case
of catalysts supported on MgAl2O4, it can be observed that
the monometallic one is very active at 573 K for CHD, and
the addition of Sn to Pt sharply decreases the initial reaction
rate, mainly for 0.5 wt.% Sn. The activation energies in
CHD also increase after the Sn addition to the Pt/MgAl2O4
sample. The effect of the Sn addition to Pt on the activation
energy appears to be more pronounced for bimetallic
catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 than for those supported on
MgAl2O4. The increase of the activation energy in this
structure-insensitive reaction [13] for both
bimetallic
catalysts with respect to the corresponding monometallic
ones would indicate a modiﬁcation of the active phase,
probably due to interactions between both metals or alloy
formation. By comparing the CHD results with those of
the n-butane conversion in pulse experiments (ﬁrst pulse,
Table 2), it can be observed that the Sn addition to
monometallic catalysts decreases the catalytic activity in
both reactions (CH and n-butane dehydrogenations) though
in a different magnitude.
Results of the cyclopentane hydrogenolysis (structure-
sensitive reaction [14]) are also indicated in Table 3, which
displays that the Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst has a negligible hy-
drogenolytic activity, in contrast to the important hydro-
genolytic capacity of the Pt/MgAl2O4 one. These behaviors
would be related to the inﬂuence of the support on the
structure of the metallic particles. It should be noted that
Aguilar-Rı
´os et al. [6,15], by using TEM measurements on
Pt supported on ZnAl2O4 with high Pt loadings, observed no
systematic orientation between the crystallographic planes
of the support and those of the Pt particles, and these metallic
particles would have a rounded shape with very low density
of steps and edges, which are the active sites for the
hydrogenolysis reactions. On the other hand, the high
hydrogenolytic activity of the Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst at the
same temperature (Table 3) indicates that the structure of the
metallic phase of this catalyst would be different to that of
the Pt/ZnAl2O4 one. It should be noted that the results
obtained in pulse experiments also show that the Pt/
MgAl2O4 catalyst display a much higher hydrogenolytic
activity in n-butane dehydrogenation than the Pt/ZnAl2O4
one (Fig. 1a and b). According to Table 3, the CPH activity
strongly decreases after the Sn addition to Pt/MgAl2O4,
which indicates a very important diminution of the
concentration of the metallic ensembles necessary for this
reaction, probably due to a blocking or dilution effect of the
Pt atoms by Sn. However, taking into account the CHD
results, the formation of PtSn alloys cannot be discarded.
3.3. Temperature programmed reduction
Figs. 4 and 5 show the TPR proﬁles of fresh mono- and
bimetallic catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 and ZnAl2O4,
respectively. The TPR proﬁles of the PtSn(0.3 wt.%)/
ZnAl2O4 and PtSn(0.3 wt.%)/MgAl2O4 bimetallic catalysts
after ﬁve reaction-regeneration cycles are also included in
these ﬁgures. The TPR proﬁle of the fresh monometallic Pt/
MgAl2O4 catalyst (Fig. 4) shows a main reduction peak at
538 K and a small peak at about 730 K. The presence of two
reduction peaks was also observed in Pt/Al2O3 catalysts and
it was explained by the existence of two different
oxychlorinated Pt species originated after the impregnation
of the support with chloroplatinic acid and the subsequent
thermal treatments (drying and calcination steps) [16]. The
TPR proﬁle of the fresh Sn(0.5 wt.%)/MgAl2O4 catalyst
shows a small, non-well-deﬁned reduction zone at high
temperatures (>650 K). Besides, the reduction proﬁles of
the fresh bimetallic catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 show a
main reduction peak (similar to that observed in the Pt/
MgAl2O4) and a small H2 consumption zone at 650–850 K.
The main peaks for the monometallic samples are smaller
than for the corresponding bimetallic ones, which are shifted
to higher temperatures: 573 K for PtSn(0.3 wt.%)/MgAl2O4
and 580 K for PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/MgAl2O4.
The TPR proﬁle of the fresh Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst (Fig. 5)
shows only one reduction peak at 564 K. This peak is shifted

to higher temperatures in the bimetallic catalysts, appearing
at 571 K for PtSn(0.3 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4 and at 616 K for
PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4. It can be also observed that the
TPR proﬁles of both fresh bimetallic catalysts show a small
reduction zone at high temperatures, similar to that observed
in the TPR proﬁle of the Sn(0.5 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4 catalyst
(Fig. 5).
By comparing the reduction proﬁles of the bimetallic
catalysts with the corresponding proﬁles of monometallic Sn
catalyst for each support series, it can be inferred that the
reduction zone at high temperature in bimetallic catalysts
could be attributed to the reduction of a small amount of Sn
stabilized on the support. Moreover, the high area of the
main peak observed in the bimetallic systems together with
the shift to higher temperatures and the broadening of this
peak after Sn addition to Pt could be related either to a
catalytic effect of Pt on the Sn reduction (the hydrogen
dissociated on Pt particles would reduce tin) or to a
simultaneous reduction of both elements with probable alloy
formation. Furthermore, Fig. 6 shows that the Sn addition to
Pt produces an increase of the H2 consumption in the TPR
experiments, which can be related to a higher Sn reducibility
in the bimetallic catalysts. It should be indicated that the H2
consumption amounts for both monometallic Pt catalysts
were such as to produce the total reduction of Pt to Pt0.
It can be observed that the TPR proﬁle of the PtSn/
ZnAl2O4 catalyst after ﬁve reaction-regeneration cycles
(Fig. 5) is very small, showing two reduction zones, one with
a maximum at about 523 K and the other at 753 K. The
shape of this TPR proﬁle resembles the sum of the proﬁles of
both monometallic catalysts, though with a very small ﬁrst
reduction peak, which is shifted to a lower temperature than
the corresponding to the fresh Pt/ZnAl2O4 sample. The ﬁrst
peak can be assigned to the reduction of Pt species and the
second
one
resembles
the
reduction
of
Sn
species.
According to Pakhomov et al. [17], an important fraction
of metallic Pt is stabilized on the support after a calcination
treatment of the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst. This can be the
reason for the small ﬁrst reduction peak (at low temperature)
of the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 sample after the ﬁve reaction-
regeneration cycles. In conclusion, an important fraction
of metallic Pt would be stabilized on the support and the
interaction between both metals appears to be decreased in
the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst after the reaction-regeneration
cycles. In the case of the TPR proﬁle corresponding to PtSn/
MgAl2O4 catalyst after the ﬁve reaction-regeneration cycles

bimetallic catalysts.
Fig. 4. TPR proﬁles of mono- and bimetallic (fresh and after ﬁve reaction-

(Fig. 4), it can be observed that the shape and the
temperatures of the reduction peaks are very similar to that
of the fresh sample, though these peaks have minor areas.
This means that the metallic phase of this catalyst exhibits a
higher stability than that supported on ZnAl2O4. These
results would agree with the higher catalytic stability
showed by the PtSn/MgAl2O4 sample through the reaction-
regeneration cycles.
The modiﬁcation of the structure of the metallic phase
would take place from cycle to cycle. It should be taken into
account that each cycle involves the reaction step, the
burning of the deposited coke (exothermic reaction) and the
reduction of the metal (exothermic process). All these
effects can be involved in the modiﬁcation of the metallic
phase, though in a different degree according to the nature of
the support.
3.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS spectra of the Pt 4f level for the PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/
ZnAl2O4 and PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/MgAl2O4 catalysts reduced
‘‘in situ’’ at 803 K showed the doublets corresponding to
zerovalent Pt 4f separated at 3.36 eV between them [18].
The doublets appear at 71.9 and 75.3 eV for the ﬁrst catalyst
and at 71.6 and 74.9 eV for the second one.
Fig. 7 shows the XPS spectra corresponding to the Sn 3d5/
2 level of Sn(0.5 wt.%)/MgAl2O4 and PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/
MgAl2O4 catalysts after reduction ‘‘in situ’’ at 803 K. From
the deconvolution of the spectrum of the Sn(0.5 wt.%)/
MgAl2O4 catalyst, two peaks were obtained at 486.4 and
487.8 eV, corresponding to different types of oxidized Sn.
According to the literature, the line corresponding to Sn 3d5/2
for SnO has a BE at 486.5–486.8 eV, while the Sn 3d5/2 line
for SnO2 has a BE at 486.5 eV [18], therefore, it is not
possible
to
discriminate
the
oxidation
state
of
Sn
corresponding to the signal positioned at 486.4 eV. In
consequence, the ﬁrst peak will be assigned to Sn(II)/
Sn(IV) oxides, while the one at 487.8 eV could be
probably due to chlorinated tin species bounded to the
support
according
to
the
evidences
reported
in
the literature [18,19]. From the deconvolution of the Sn
3d5/2
line
of
the
spectrum
corresponding
to
the
PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/MgAl2O4 catalyst, three peaks were also
obtained at 484.5, 486.4 and 487.9 eV. The ﬁrst one only
appears in the XPS spectrum of the bimetallic catalyst and
it would correspond to zerovalent Sn [18]. The second and
the third peaks would be due to Sn(II)/Sn(IV) oxides and to
chlorinated tin species bounded to the support, respec-
tively, in a similar way as for the Sn(0.5 wt.%)/MgAl2O4
sample.
Fig. 8 shows the XPS spectra corresponding to the Sn 3d5/2
level of Sn(0.5 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4 and PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4
catalysts after reduction ‘‘in situ’’ at 803 K. From the
deconvolution of the spectrum of the Sn(0.5 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4
catalyst, two peaks at 485.6 eV (Sn(II/IV) oxides) and at
487.5 eV (SnCl2/support) were obtained. The spectrum of the
Sn 3d5/2 level for the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst is similar to that
of the PtSn/MgAl2O4 one and also shows three peaks at
484.5 eV (Sn(0)), 486.4 eV (Sn(II)/Sn(IV) oxides) and
487.9 eV (SnCl2/support).
The presence of Sn(0) in bimetallic catalysts and the
absence of this species in the Sn monometallic one, would

indicate a higher Sn reducibility in PtSn catalysts, these
results agreeing with the TPR ones.
Taking into account the above mentioned results for
reduced bimetallic catalysts, it can be concluded that a
fraction of Sn would be as Sn(0), probably alloyed with Pt,
and the remaining Sn appears to be as Sn(II)/Sn(IV) oxides
and chlorinated tin species bounded to the support.
According to Figs. 7 and 8, the percentage of surface
Sn(0) is similar for both bimetallic catalysts. Besides, from
the XPS results surface atomic ratios of Sn/Pt was
determined, which were 3.50 for PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4
and 4.38 for PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/MgAl2O4. Taking into account
that both bimetallic catalysts have a bulk Sn/Pt atomic ratio
of 2.74, it can be inferred that there is a certain surface
enrichment in Sn in both catalysts, mainly for the
PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/MgAl2O4 one.
3.5. Hydrogen chemisorption
Table 3 shows the values of the chemisorbed hydrogen
volume on mono- and bimetallic catalysts supported on
ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4. It can be observed that the
chemisorption capacity of the Pt/ZnAl2O4 sample is clearly
lower than that of the Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst. This different
behavior could be assigned to several causes: (1) the surface
area of the ZnAl2O4 is lower than that of the MgAl2O4, (2) a
different interaction of the metallic phase with these two
supports and (3) a probable PtZn alloy formation in the Pt/
ZnAl2O4 catalyst, mainly when the support is prepared from
stoichiometric amounts of Al2O3 and ZnO, instead of using
an excess of Al2O3 [6,20].
The value of the surface area of the support could lead to a
different metal dispersion. However, the surface area should
not be considered as the unique factor in this analysis, since
the metal–support interaction could play an important role.
Thus, Aguilar-Rı
´os et al. [6] have found by using energy
dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) and HRTEM on Pt/ZnAl2O4
catalysts with low Pt contents, that a fraction of Pt would
occupy the oxygen vacancies of the ﬁrst layers of the spinel
structure having a strong interaction with the support. This
fraction of platinum appears as islands of electron deﬁcient
Pt species. Besides, these authors (by using XRD) did not
detect metallic particles for low Pt loadings, probably due to
the small size of these ones. However, these catalysts
showed very low H2 chemisorption capacities. These
ﬁndings would indicate that the chemisorption value is
not an adequate measurement of the Pt particle size for this
type of catalyst. It must be remembered that Pakhomov and
Buyanov [21] found that the PtCl6
2–ZnAl2O4 interaction
was stronger than the PtCl6
2–MgAl2O4 one. Hence, it can
be expected a lower possibility for the formation of electron
deﬁcient Pt islands in the ﬁrst layer of the spinel structure
of MgAl2O4 for the Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst. In this sense,
Table 3 shows a higher H2 chemisorption capacity of the
Pt/MgAl2O4 sample, this value being equivalent to Pt dis-
persion near to 50%.
With respect to the effect of the remaining impurities in
the support after puriﬁcation, it must be indicated that after
the extraction treatment with (NH4)2CO3 the XRD analysis
did not show the characteristic ZnO lines in ZnAl2O4.
However, an additional XRD experiment on Pt(1 wt.%)/
ZnAl2O4 showed the characteristic lines of the Pt–Zn
alloys (at d = 3.509, 2.219 and 1.747 A
˚ ) but with very
low intensities. These lines are in agreement with the
values reported in the literature for d-PtZn alloy [20].
This alloy appears to be inactive for the hydrogen
chemisorption, dehydrogenation of parafﬁns [20] and for
the oxidation of isobutene [22]. However, this effect does
not appear to be important for explaining the behavior of
this
monometallic
catalyst
in
the
H2
chemisorption
measurements. It should be also indicated that the formation
of Pt–Mg alloys has not been reported in the literature
[20].
The different behavior of Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4
catalysts in the H2 chemisorption can be also related to the
catalytic performance in n-butane dehydrogenation (ﬂow
experiments). In fact, the initial n-butane conversion for
the Pt/MgAl2O4 sample is about four times higher than that
for the Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst, and this value is very close to
the H2 chemisorption capacity ratio between these two
catalysts.
When Sn is added to Pt (in both catalyst series)
the chemisorption capacity decreases, mainly for the
PtSn(0.5 wt.%)/MgAl2O4 sample. This behavior is parallel
to the decrease of CHD reaction rate for both catalysts series.
The decrease of the hydrogen adsorption capacity on both
bimetallic catalysts is lower than the diminution of the CHD
rate, probably due to different structural requirements
between the H2 chemisorption and the CHD reaction.

3.6. Microcalorimetric measurements of propylene
adsorption
Two different catalysts, Pt/ZnAl2O4 and PtSn(0.3 wt.%)/
ZnAl2O4, were evaluated by means of this technique. Fig. 9
shows the adsorption isotherms of propylene for both
catalysts. It can be observed that the chemisorbed propylene
amount for the monometallic catalyst is higher than for the
bimetallic one. Fig. 10 shows the differential adsorption
heats of propylene as a function of the propylene coverage
(deﬁned as the ratio between the amount of adsorbed
propylene in a given point and that of the monolayer uptake).
It can be observed that the propylene adsorption heats for the
Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalyst are higher than for the PtSn(0.3 wt.%)/
ZnAl2O4 one in the overall range of the propylene coverage.
Moreover, it can be appreciated in Fig. 10 that the Sn
addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 decreases the initial adsorption heat
of the oleﬁn (obtained by extrapolation of the curves to the
propylene
coverage equal
to
0)
from
approximately
120 kJ mol1 for the monometallic catalyst to approxi-
mately 80 kJ mol1 for the bimetallic one. This lower initial
adsorption heat of the oleﬁn on the bimetallic catalyst would
indicate that the binding energy between the alkene and
the metallic site is weakened because of the Sn addition
to Pt.
According to the literature [23], adsorption experiments
of 1-hexene on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts indicate
that the oleﬁn is strongly adsorbed on Pt through the bonding
of several carbon atoms placed in a ﬂat position on the
metallic surface. On the other hand, 1-hexene is weakly
adsorbed on the bimetallic phase of PtSn, and the oleﬁn
would be placed in tilted or perpendicular position [23].
Moreover, several authors have studied the effect of the Sn
addition to Pt supported on different materials on the
adsorption
of
ethylene
and
isobutene
[24–26].
The
combined results of microcalorimetric and spectroscopic
studies suggest that the ethylene is dissociatively adsorbed
on the platinum surface at room temperature producing
ethylidyne species and adsorbed atomic hydrogen. On the
contrary, the Sn addition to Pt suppresses the formation of
these species, so that only the molecularly adsorbed ethylene
is present at room temperature on the surface of Pt modiﬁed
by Sn [25]. Besides, the higher initial adsorption heat of
ethylene (150 kJ mol1) on the Pt surface at room tem-
perature has been attributed to the dissociation of ethylene,
while the lower initial adsorption heat (115 kJ mol1) on the
bimetallic PtSn phase can be explained by the presence of
ethylene molecules adsorbed on the surface [25]. It has been
reported that the Sn addition to Pt/SiO2 reduces the initial
adsorption heat of isobutene from 185 to 125 kJ mol1 [24].
The higher adsorption heat of isobutene on the monometallic
catalyst was attributed to the dissociation of the oleﬁn,
whereas the lower isobutene adsorption heat on the
bimetallic catalyst can be caused by the presence of
isobutene adsorbed in a molecular way [24]. These authors
concluded that the Sn addition to Pt reduces the actual size of
surface Pt ensembles by geometric and/or electronic effects,
and in consequence it suppresses the formation of highly
dehydrogenated surface species.
Considering these bibliographic reports, our results of the
microcalorimetric measurements of the propylene adsorp-
tion on Pt/ZnAl2O4 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts could be
interpreted taking into account that the high initial propylene
adsorption heat on the Pt/ZnAl2O4 surface could be
attributed to the dissociation of the oleﬁn into propylidyne
species and adsorbed atomic hydrogen, while the lower
adsorption heat of propylene on the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 surface
would be caused by the adsorption of molecular propylene.
From these evidences it can be concluded that the presence
of Sn in the vicinity of Pt would produce a decrease both in
the size of the Pt ensembles and the Pt–oleﬁn interaction
strength, by geometric and electronic effects. Therefore,
once the oleﬁn is formed (from the parafﬁn dehydrogena-
tion) it is immediately desorbed, avoiding the formation of
the coke precursors by a further dehydrogenation reaction on
the bimetallic catalyst. Hence, an increase of the dehy-
drogenation selectivity and a lower formation of carbonac-
eous deposits could be expected for the bimetallic catalysts,
such as, it can be observed from pulse experiment results. On
the other hand, the surface of the monometallic catalyst
would be composed by large Pt ensembles, which would
strongly adsorb the oleﬁns in a dissociative way (when it is
produced), followed by the dehydrogenation to coke
precursors, thus increasing the carbon deposition.
4. Conclusions
From the evidences presented in the paper the following
conclusions can be obtained:

an increase of the activity in n-butane dehydrogenation,
and to high selectivity values to all butenes (1-butene, cis-
and trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene). Besides, these
bimetallic catalysts show low deactivation parameter
values (close to 20%) and the yields to all butenes for the
PtSn(0.3 wt.%) catalysts supported on both supports are
slightly higher than for catalysts with a higher Sn content
(0.5 wt.%).

regeneration cycles, though the stability of the PtSn/
MgAl2O4 catalyst was clearly higher than for the PtSn/
ZnAl2O4 one. These behaviors can be related to the
higher stability of the metallic phase for the ﬁrst catalyst
after the ﬁve successive reaction-regeneration cycles,
according to the TPR results.
3. The structure of the metallic phase of the Pt/ZnAl2O4
catalyst appears to be different from that of the Pt/
MgAl2O4 one. In the ﬁrst case, the metallic particles have
a very low hydrogenolytic capacity (according to CPH
results). In the case of Pt/MgAl2O4, the metallic particles
display an important concentration of hydrogenolytic
centers. The different hydrogenolytic capacities between
Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts can explain the
very different selectivities to butenes found in the pulse
experiments.
4. When Sn is added to Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/ZnAl2O4
catalysts, the tin reducibility is increased by either the
catalytic effect of platinum or the PtSn co-reduction with
probable alloy formation. Besides, a very complex
structure of the metallic phase appears to be present in the
bimetallic catalysts. In fact, a probable description of this
phase would involve the presence of Pt in zerovalent
state, which could be partially alloyed with a fraction of
zerovalent tin (according to CHD results). Taking into
account the XPS results, these alloy particles coexist with
other species: oxidized Sn, which could be stabilized on
the support and segregated on the surface of the metallic
phase, and SnCl2 species supported on the aluminates.
Oxidized Sn species could produce both the blocking of
the zerovalent Pt atoms and the dilution of the active
centers. These effects lead to a decrease of the con-
centration of Pt ensembles necessary for the hydro-
genolysis reactions and the coke deposition (according to
CPH, dehydrogenation of n-butane in pulse experiments
and microcalorimetric results of propylene adsorption).
Then,
when
these
catalysts
are
used
in
parafﬁn
dehydrogenation, the selectivity to oleﬁns is increased
because the formation of lower parafﬁns by hydro-
genolysis is sharply decreased, and the carbon deposition
is also diminished, thus improving the catalytic per-
formance of the bimetallic catalysts.
