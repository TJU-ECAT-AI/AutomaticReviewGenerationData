Design and Parallel Synthesis of Novel Selective Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysts and their Application in Alkane Dehydrogenation
Abstract
A library of 19 supported metal oxides of group IIIA, IVA, and VA metals is prepared using a simple gram-scale reactor for parallel pore impregnation. The activity, stability, and selectivity of these potential hydrogen combustion catalysts in the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene at 600 °C is examined over several redox cycles using gas mixtures that simulate real process conditions. Lead, indium, and thallium oxides are highly selective (>99.9%) to hydrogen combustion. Low-loading catalysts are found to exhibit higher oxygen exchange activity. Differences between co-fed and redox oxidative dehydrogenation are discussed.
