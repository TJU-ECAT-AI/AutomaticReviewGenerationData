Whether a single rate-controlling step exists in complex reversible heterogeneous catalytic reac- 
tions is difficult to establish, especially with non-metallic catalysts, which often possess fewer active 
sites than supported metals. This problem is treated here using transient isotopic tracing with 
13C marking for the system isobutane-isobutene-hydrogen over a chromia catalyst. A statistical 
approach is employed for modeling the simultaneous occurrence of traced isobutane and isobutene 
in the product stream using the Horiuti-Polanyi, mechanism. We find that a single rate-controlling 
step that consists of the conversion of the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species i-C4H9I to 
chemisorbed isobutene i-C4H8/and the reverse exists. Such information should be useful for catalyst 
design and prediction of performance.

INTRODUCTION 
Basically two types of heterogeneous 
catalytic reactions have been widely studied 
for both fundamental understanding and 
practical applications. First there are those 
that are characterized by a set of unidirec- 
tional steps. These include such reactions as 
the cracking of petroleum compounds and 
their oxidation. The second class of systems 
are those in which reversible reactions such 
as the synthesis of ammonia and of sulfuric 
acid as well as dehydrogenation 
and isomer- 
ization reactions occur. Tracer studies have 
been almost entirely devoted to unidirec- 
tional reactions, and particularly those in- 
volved in the hydrogenation of carbon 
monoxide according to the well-known Fi- 
scher-Tropsch synthesis. Nearly all these 
studies have involved the use of metallic 
catalysts, in which the surface concentra- 
tions of adsorbed intermediates are rela- 
tively high. Here we treat the 13C tracing

of reactions among mixtures of isobutane, 
isobutene and hydrogen using a chromia cat- 
alyst as representative of non-metallic spe- 
cies. The reactions studied are reversible. 
Hence they proceed at a slower rate as equi- 
librium is approached. These two features 
necessitate special modifications in both ex- 
perimental and theoretical treatment. 
Tracer studies of heterogeneous catalytic 
systems can serve two purposes. Some are 
directed to the establishment of 
mechanisms 
involved and may be applied to the develop- 
ment of improved catalysts based on knowl- 
edge of factors controlling slow steps. An- 
other use of tracer studies lies in the 
construction of kinetic rate equations with 
more than an empirical basis. 
Transient isotopic tracing affords special 
advantages compared to steady-state trac- 
ing for access to the fundamental parame- 
ters in a heterogeneous catalytic system (1). 
In such studies, a traced species is substi- 
tuted for one that is untraced (or the reverse) 
while at the same time the overall catalytic 
reaction itself remains unchanged, provided

that isotopic kinetic effects can be ne- 
glected. It is assumed that the rates of che- 
misorption or desorption from the gas phase 
are much slower than the redistribution of 
adsorbed surface species. By study of a 
steady-state reaction under given ambient 
conditions, one is able to assess the magni- 
tudes of individual step velocities and con- 
centrations of adsorbed surface species re- 
gardless of the overall kinetics, which is 
usually written in terms of the effect of 
changes in pressure, temperature, and con- 
centrations of terminal species (reactants 
and products). 
In studies involving conventional kinet- 
ics, it is often assumed (LHHW models) 
that a single rate-controlling step exists for a 
given mechanism. It is very difficult to test 
the validity of this assumption because often 
a number of possible mechanisms may be 
considered, each comprising a number of 
elementary mechanistic steps. By using 
transient tracing (1) it is possible to provide 
a sharper identification of whether a single 
rate-controlling step exists in such a com- 
plex reversible heterogeneous reaction. 
This was one of the main purposes of the 
present study. 
Preliminary findings were presented at the 
9th International Congress on Catalysis (2). 
In the present paper we include results ob- 
tained using important additional refine- 
ments in experimental procedure and data 
interpretation, as described in what follows. 
METHODS 
Experimental Procedure 
A gradientless recirculating open-flow re- 
actor (Fig. 1) similar to those that we had 
employed previously (1) was used. The ad- 
vantage of a recirculating reactor is that it 
can approximate a well-mixed system, so 
that a fixed reaction rate can be obtained at 
steady state, similar to that obtainable in 
a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). 
Using a diaphragm pump (Metal Bellows 
Corp. MB-41), gas was recirculated at a rate 
of 6000 ml/min. The internal recirculation 
rate was approximately 60/1, corresponding

to a forward flow of 100 ml min 
-1. Dead 
space in the reactor system was usually be- 
tween 100 and 160 ml depending on size of 
the reactor, amount of catalyst, and charge 
of inert glass beads. Mean residence times 
in the total dead space of the system were 
60 to 90 s under our experimental condi- 
tions. For satisfactory resolution, it is desir- 
able that concentrations of intermediates be 
as high as possible relative to amounts of 
unadsorbed species circulating in the reac- 
tion system. In the case of non-metallic cata- 
lysts, concentrations of intermediates are 
smaller than for supported metals, so rela- 
tively larger quantities of catalyst were re- 
quired in this investigation (up to 20 g). 
The catalyst employed here was unsup- 
ported chromia gel prepared by the proce- 
dure described by Emmett and Cines (3), in 
which the gel is precipitated from a solution 
of chromic nitrate using excess ammonium 
hydroxide. The gel was dried slowly for 3 
days at 423 K. Surface area by the Bru- 
nauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method was 
261 m 
2 g-1. Before each experiment, the 
catalyst was reduced with hydrogen at 633 
K for 12 h and then purged with helium at 
the same temperature for 6 h. Amorphous 
chromia gel rather than chromia alumina 
was used because it possesses a substan- 
tially higher concentration of active surface 
sites (roughly four times). 
The void fraction of the catalyst particle 
TRANSIENT ISOTOPIC TRACING 
385 
was estimated to be 0.57 - 0.08 using the 
procedure described by Kao (4), with n-hex- 
ane as a wetting liquid. The particles were 
sized to an average diameter of about 2 mm. 
External diffusion resistance was negligible 
because of the high recirculation rate (parti- 
cle Nee -- 50,000). Intraparticle resistance 
was checked by computation of 
the modified 
Thiele modulus and found to be typically 
equal to 0.005. Application of this modulus 
specifies that the effectiveness factor for a 
catalytic reaction will be greater than 0.95, 
if this modulus is less than unity. 
Two syringe pumps (100 ml, Sage Instru- 
ments Model 351) were installed in tandem 
on a sliding stand such that the switch from 
the non-tagged inlet to the labeled stream 
was completed almost instantaneously. This 
switching technique minimized pulsation to 
the entering stream because no valve was 
employed. Pressure at the reactant injection 
point could be monitored by inserting a nee- 
dle probe into the flowing stream. This pres- 
sure reading was maintained at atmospheric 
with a deviation of less than -+ 1 ml of mer- 
cury by adjusting the opening of a Teflon 
needle valve installed at the outlet of the 
bellows pump. The needle diameter of the 
syringe pumps was found to be critical. 
Tubular flow rate is proportional to the 
fourth power of the diameter and also de- 
pends on the nature of the gas stream being 
fed. If the diameter is too small, the pressure 
at the upstream side will cause leakage 
around the piston seal. However, if it is too 
large the pressure drop between the reser- 
voir in the piston and the flowing stream in 
the apparatus will be so small that the rate 
of delivery will fluctuate due to the inability 
to control the pressure inside the vessel with 
sufficient precision. In our studies, a 1-in. 
(2.54 cm)-length Yale Gage 25 (i.d. ~ 0.18 
mm) was employed. 
Another item that was given considerable 
attention was the employment of additional 
insulation and an electric heating coil. De- 
tails are given by Kao (4). Temperature was 
monitored by inserting several thermocou- 
pies into the top, center, and bottom of the 
catalyst bed as well as between the insulat- 
ing layer and the heating coil. With these 
refinements, it was possible to reduce the 
longitudinal gradient to 2.4 K over an 8- 
cm depth of packed column and the radial 
gradient to less than 1 K across the 1.7-cm 
radius. Therefore an isothermal recirculat- 
ing reactor was reasonably approximated. 
Steady-state tracing levels of reactor efflu- 
ent were independently confirmed by ther- 
modynamic calculations. 
Gas analyses were conducted in a manner 
similar to that previously described (5). A 
Finnigan quadrupole mass spectrometer 
(type 1015C) was employed to analyze the 
gas composition on line. The electron en- 
ergy used was 25 eV, and the ionization 
current was 100 txA. Fragmentation 
patterns 
of the pure species, as well as mixture sam- 
ples, were analyzed separately. It was found 
that for a mixture of isobutane-isobu- 
tene-hydrogen the intensity versus concen- 
tration relationships sometimes deviated 
from linearity, due possibly to interactions 
among molecular fragments. Calibration 
was made by independent gas chromato- 
graphic analysis, using a Perkin-Elmer 
Model 900 with helium carrier gas and a 
flame-ionization detector. 
Dead space (CSTR gas phase holdup) was 
determined by both static and dynamic mea- 
surements. In static tests, a gas sample of 
known volume was injected into the system 
and the pressure was measured. In dynamic 
measurements, argon step-up and step- 
down tests were conducted. These experi- 
ments were conducted at a bed temperature 
close to those of tracer experiments. 
Data Interpretation 
As discussed in the result section, we first 
considered a series of model structures, 
each new structure a simplification of the 
previous one. In order to select the simplest 
appropriate model structure, it was neces- 
sary to estimate the parameters for each of 
them. For that purpose, the data were inter- 
preted using the unweighted non-linear least 
squares criterion, which is the most com- 
386 
KAO ET AL. 
monly used method for correlating data, so 
that we thought it should be used as a refer- 
ence method. As discussed under Results, 
this procedure showed that the best models 
for all structures gave almost exactly the 
same predictions, so that the simplest model 
structure was selected for making more 
elaborate statistical calculations. These cal- 
culations address the problem that arises 
when using the least-squares criterion in a 
situation like this where more than one set 
of responses is obtained in each experiment, 
because it is not known what relative weight 
should be given to the separate sets of data. 
One way of circumventing this difficulty is 
to use Box and Draper's determinant crite- 
rion (6-8), which is as straightforward as 
unweighted least-squares. We used the de- 
terminant criterion as a second method to 
estimate the parameters of the structure se- 
lected. 
A further problem after estimating the val- 
ues of the parameters is to assess the uncer- 
tainties of these values. A conventional way 
of doing this, which we followed for the 
least-squares estimates, is to use the Fisher 
information matrix to compute estimated 
standard deviations for each parameter. The 
determinant approach also produces a 
model of the noise corrupting the data. This 
gives us the possibility of assessing the tin- 
certainty of the parameters by a Monte 
Carlo approach (see, e.g., (9)). 
The tracer output appears in both isobu- 
tane and isobutene. It is therefore conve- 
nient to express it as a two-dimensional vec- 
tor y(t). Let ym(t, 0) be the corresponding 
model output, where 0 is the vector of the 
parameters to be estimated. In the determi- 
^ 
nant criterion approach, the estimate Odet 
is 
obtained by minimizing the criterion 
j(O) = det O(O) 
(1) 
with respect to 0, where D(O) is a 2 x 2 
matrix given by

O)][y(t 
i) 
/ 
1 
- ym(ti, 0)] 
r, 
(2) 
with N the number of measurement times t i . 
D(O) corresponds to the sample covariance 
of the error between the measurements and 
corresponding model output. When there is 
only a single measurement at time ti (i = 
1 
..... 
N), y becomes a scalar and the deter- 
minant criterion reduces to the unweighted 
least-squares criterion. This refinement is 
therefore of interest here because we observe 
the markings of more than a single species, in 
this case isobutane and isobutene. 
bdet 
is the maximum-likelihood 
estimate of 
0 under the hypothesis that the data satisfy 
y(ti) = ym(ti, O) + n(ti), 
(i = 1,... 
,N), 
(3) 
where the n(ti) (i = 1 
..... 
N) are indepen- 
dently identically distributed Gaussian vec- 
tors with zero mean and (unknown) covari- 
ance E. The maximum-likelihood estimate 
of this covariance is then simply given by 
Eml = D(bdet). 
(4) 
The unweighted least-squares estimate of 0 
is a maximum-likelihood estimate if E = 
o-21, where I is the identity matrix, which is 
a more restrictive hypothesis than that used 
in the determinant approach. The determi- 
nant criterion therefore has the advantage of 
being more general while keeping the same 
number of parameters in the optimization 
problem. A further advantage of this ap- 
proach is that the parameters of the deter- 
ministic part of the model (0) and of the 
noise (E) are estimated by minimizing a cri- 
terion that is a function of 0 only. 
If one could repeat the same experiment 
several times, one would obtain different 
data sets because of the random perturba- 
tions involved. By estimating the parame- 
ters associated with each of these data sets, 
one could obtain an idea of the variability in 
the estimates due to the variability in the 
data. The basic idea of Monte Carlo analysis 
is to replace actual experiments by simula- 
tions of the best available model. This ap- 
proach has the advantage over the use of 
the 
Fisher information matrix of not relying on 
asymptotic results on the convergence prop-

erty of maximum likelihood estimators (at 
the cost of requiring much more computa- 
tion). For each run, 500 simulated data sets 
were generated by computing

then computed by minimizing the determi- 
nant criterion for each of these simulated

RESULTS 
In studying this reversible reaction by 
transient tracing, there are eight basic types 
of experiments that can be conducted. For 
the isobutane-isobutene-hydrogen system, 
one can study either hydrogenation 
or dehy- 
drogenation. Second, it is possible to label 
either isobutane or isobutene with 13C, pro- 
vided that both are present in the feed. Fi- 
nally it is possible to conduct an experiment 
using either step-up, in which the marked 
species is substituted abruptly in place of 
unmarked species at the beginning of a tran- 
sient test, or a step-down, where the reverse 
procedure is used after operation at steady 
state with tracer. 
In the course of these studies, all these 
modes of operation were employed to en- 
sure that consistent results were being ob- 
tained. Greater precision was achieved by 
reactant labeling because the amount of 
traced species was higher, so this procedure 
was adopted in recent experiments aimed at 
the most accurate determination of parame- 
ters. In a step-up experiment the initial con- 
ditions correspond to natural abundance of 
the 13C. In a step-down experiment, how- 
ever, initial conditions are obtained from 
measurements at the final marking level of 
a previous step-up experiment that has been 
operated for a time sufficient to approach 
steady state. Thus error in the initial condi- 
tion for a step-down experiment can be in- 
herited from its previous step-up. Therefore 
the step-down procedure was infrequently 
employed. With these factors considered, 
we selected six typical data sets as represen- 
tative of our most recent data. The transient 
tracing conditions of these data sets are 
summarized in Table I. 
In our study we assumed the well-known 
Horiuti-Polanyi (10) mechanism involving 
the half-hydrogenated state. The overall re- 
action is 
i-C4Hr0 = i-C4H8 + H2. 
(8) 
It consists of the following elementary 
steps:

Here I denotes a site for chemisorption. For 
this reaction both hydrogenation and dehy- 
drogenation may be conveniently con- 
ducted at a temperature near 623 K over 
chromia gel catalyst. The molecular species 
involved when 13C is used as a tracer are i- 
C4Hlo, i-C4H9/, 
i-C4H8/, 
and i-C4H

. Each of 
these molecular species constitutes one pool 
in a transient-tracing compartmental model 
(Fig. 2a). The ordinary differential equa- 
tions associated with this four-pool model 
are obtained by material balances for tracer 
species over each of the compartments (1):

Only five parameters must be evaluated. 
Two of them are the surface concentrations 
of i-C4Hgl and i-C4H81 on the catalyst. The 
remaining three can be taken as V+l, v+2, 
and u+3. The corresponding step velocities 
v_i can be computed from the three v+i be- 
cause the overall rate of dehydrogenation V 
= v+ z - 
v_i is independently determined. 
All parameters have been shown in (I1) to 
be structurally globally identifiable. 
(14) 
Table 2 presents their values, estimated by 
unweighted nonlinear least-squares regres- 
sion for several typical data sets. For each 
data set, the overall velocity was recorded as 
well as the fractional markings of both isobu- 
(15) 
tane and isobutene as functions of time. 
From results of this type, it was clear that 
the last step is very close to equilibrium, so 
we next considered a reduced model lump- 
ing the last two compartments to obtain the

them are structurally

those listed in Table 1. Results are summa-

The parameters appearing in this reduced 
three-pool model are consistent with those 
of the original four-compartment model. 
The estimated velocity of i-C4H10 chemi- 
sorption v+l is still so high that it can be 
reasonably considered to be at equilibrium. 
Consequently we further reduced the model 
by lumping the first and second steps as 
shown in Fig. 2c.

genation. Indicated in parentheses is a 
(rough) estimate of the standard deviations 
of the parameters obtained from the diago- 
nal of the inverse of the Fisher information 
matrix. Again the parameters appearing in 
this two-pool model compare very closely 
with those obtained from the three- and 
four-pool models. This simplest model 
therefore gives results consistent with those 
of the more complex models. Moreover, it 
correlates the data in a manner almost iden- 
tical to those with more complex structures. 
Figures 3 to 8 show measured versus calcu- 
lated values for the observed tracer mark- 
ings for the models presented in Table 5. 
Since these experiments used reactant 
marking, an immediate increase in reactant 
tracer fraction is observed. Product tracer 
fraction, on the other hand, exhibits a zero 
initial slope resulting in an S-shaped curve. 
Given a suitable correlation of the data, 
the next question that arises concerns the 
reliability of the estimated parameters them- 
selves. As discussed under Methods, sepa- 
rate additional treatment of the data was 
employed using the determinant criterion. 
This affords a less restrictive approach to 
parameter estimation. Table 6 gives the esti- 
mates bd~t 
obtained for the parameters of the 
two-pool model by minimizing the determi- 
nant criterion for the same runs as those in 
Table 5. The corresponding estimated stan- 
dard deviations are indicated in parenthe-

ses. To compute 0det, we used a global opti- 
mizer (12) implementing the adaptive 
random search strategy (13). This optimizer 
is capable of escaping local minima of the 
criterion and is thus much less sensitive than 
conventional local optimizers to the initial 
value for the parameters to be estimated. 
The prior feasible range for each parameter 
was chosen as [0, 1] and the initial value for 0 
was taken as the center of the corresponding 
feasible box, i.e., 0 = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) r. Using 
other initial values for the parameters, the 
same estimates were obtained. To keep the 
amount of computation within feasible lim- 
its, the estimates O 
k needed for the Monte 
Carlo analysis were computed using a local 
optimizer with the initial value bd~t. 
Although obtained under less restrictive 
hypotheses, results shown in Table 6 agree 
quite well with those determined using the 
unweighted least-squares criterion given in 
Table 5. The estimated standard deviations 
reported in Tables 5 and 6 are very small 
and indicate that the parameters are very 
precisely determined. However, their abso- 
lute accuracy relies on that of the statistical 
hypotheses made on the measurement er- 
ror. Greater uncertainty, of course, exists 
for the values of the parameters themselves 
due to systematic errors in rate measure-

We do not believe that measurement accu- 
racy is better than +-5% with consequent 
errors in parameter estimation. Diffusional 
resistances for steps close to equilibrium in- 
troduce further uncertainties. 
Because of the fact that the simulations 
of the outputs of the models described in 
Tables 5 and 6 are almost identical, the infor- 
mation presented in Figs. 3 to 8 also applies 
to the models described in Table 6. 
As shown in Tables 2 to 6, employing 
several models and estimation methods, the 
concentration of i-C4H9/ species is higher 
than that of i-C4Hsl 
during the dehydrogena- 
tion and the reverse is true during hydroge- 
nation. Such an accumulation in a catenary 
reaction path is consistent with the simulta- 
neous occurrence of small differences be- 
tween values of rate constants for forward 
and reverse velocities of the rate-controlling 
step, along with small differences between 
the concentrations of unoccupied catalyst 
sites and those occupied by chemisorbed 
hydrogen atoms.

mation of the high rates of interaction of 
terminal species with the catalyst. The reac- 
tor system was reduced with hydrogen for 
several hours and purged with helium at a 
temperature of 523 K, considerably below 
temperatures employed for hydrogena- 
tion-dehydrogenation experiments. Fol- 
lowing this a step function is introduced con- 
sisting of a mixture of deuterium and 
isobutane. In less than 10 s, HD as well as 
multiple i-C4HxDl0-x species were observed 
in the effluent, showing that hydrogen and 
hydrocarbon exchanges are very rapid. 
Experiments were also conducted to fur- 
nish independent information concerning 
adsorbed species. The catalyst was reduced 
and purged with helium as described under 
experimental procedure. A mixture of argon 
and isobutene in the ratio 1 : 1 together with 
helium carrier gas was then passed over the 
catalyst as 338°C (15-20°C lower than the 
usual hydrogenation-dehydrogenation ex- 
periments). A delay in isobutene concentra- 
tion appearance in the CSTR was observed. 
This was considered to be due to adsorption 
ofisobutene from the gas phase. The differ- 
ence between the curves for isobutene and 
argon was integrated and corresponded to 
0.08 ml NTP g-1. At the end of this adsorp- 
tion period the flow of the argon-isobntene 
mixture was stopped and the system was 
purged with He carrier gas until no isobu- 
tene would be detected in the effluent. The 
purpose of this procedure was to remove 
physically adsorbed isobutene, leaving iso- 
butene chemisorbed on active catalyst sites. 
Hydrogen was then injected into the CSTR 
at a rate of 4 ml NTP rain- 1 
along with car- 
rier gas. Two or three min after hydrogen 
injection commenced, isobutane was ob- 
served in the effluent and this phenomenon 
proceeded for about 6 min as shown in Fig. 
9. By integrating the isobutane curve with 
respect to time, the amount of chemisorbed 
isobutene reacted with hydrogen was found 
to correspond to 0.04 ml NTP g-l. This cor- 
responds approximately with values re- 
ported in Tables 5 and 6 for the sum of con- 
centrations of i-C4H81 and i-C4H9l. In regular 
tracer experiments less than 1% of CH4 rela- 
tive to C4's was detected in the effluent, 
indicating absence of cracking. No methane 
or other hydrocarbons were detected in the 
adsorption experiments. Isobutane in con- 
trast to isobutene adsorbs dissociatively 
producing hydrogen, adsorption of which 
can then compete for surface sites, so inter- 
pretation of results is more complicated in 
that case and there is less hydrocarbon ad- 
sorption (about 0.02 ml NTP g-1 at 337°C). 
DISCUSSION 
The catalytic properties of chromia have 
been studied extensively by Burwell and co- 
workers (14-16) and Molina (17), so it is of 
interest to compare their findings with those 
of this study.

change, Burwell et al. (14, 15) concluded 
that the primary hydrogen atoms in propane 
are at least six times more reactive than the 
secondary ones over chromia gel catalyst. 
It appears that the nine primary hydrogen 
atoms on the rotating H3C-C 
groups in iso- 
butane are more likely than the single ter- 
tiary hydrogen atom of an isobutane mole- 
cule to contact the catalyst surface, so that 
sterochemical effects should be even more 
pronounced than in the case of propane. 
In the case of isobutane additional energy 
would also be required to change the tetra- 
hedral (i-C4Hgl) structure to the planar (i- 
C4H91) form, which is an important factor in 
explaining the relatively slow rate of this 
step observed in our studies. 
As regards surface concentrations of ad- 
sorbed species, the amorphous chromia pre- 
pared by us has approximately the same sur- 
face area by the BET method as that used 
by Burwell et al. (16) and Molina (17). These 
authors considered that the irreversible ad- 
sorption of carbon monoxide constituted a 
suitable measure of active sites and reported 
values of 1,1 molecules/100 A 2 for amor- 
phous chromia. This corresponds to adsorp- 
tion of 11.4 ml NTP g-1 of catalyst which is 
decidedly larger than the 0.04 ml NTP g-1 
occupied by the sum of i-C4HsI and i-C4H91 
intermediates m our studies. The partial 
pressures of reacting species are much 
lower than atmospheric pressure in our 
case. This fact along with the shapes of iso- 
butane and isobutene molecules may con- 
tribute to this difference in behavior. 
It is of interest to compare the values of 
V+/V_ reported in Table 4 with those pre- 
dicted from relationships based on transi- 
tion state theory and thermodynamics (Hap-

Using data from experiments on the isobu-

system 
over 
chromia alumina catalyst, similar to those 
reported earlier (Happel et al., (18)) we esti- 
mated that for the conditions given in Table 
4 V+/V_ should equal 2.433 based on the 
observed temperature of 629 K. The values 
in Table 4 are about 5% higher, correspond- 
ing to a predicted temperature of about 630 
K. This is better agreement than would be 
expected considering experimental accu- 
racy. It does provide further corroboration

this study is the demonstration that a revers-
