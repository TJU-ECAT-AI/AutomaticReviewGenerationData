Mesoporous
 Cr–TiO2 materials
 with  chromium
 content
 from
 0.02  to 0.30  (Cr/Ti  molar  ratio)
 were  syn-
thesized
 using
 a  nonionic
 Pluronic
 F127  surfactant,  and  the  mesostructure
 was  conﬁrmed
 by  BET,  SAXS
and
 TEM.  The  stability
 of
 the  mesoporous
 structure
 under
 the  atmospheres
 of  propane
 oxidative  dehy-
drogenation
 (PODH)
 and  air  was  investigated.
 The
 variety
 in  valence  states  and  the  distribution
 of Cr
species
 on  the  surface  were  also  evaluated
 by  WXRD,  XPS,  UV–vis  and  H2-TPR  methods.
 The acid
 prop-
erties
 including
 kinds,  number
 and
 strength
 were
 measured
 by  NH3-TPD  and  IR-Py  experiment.
 Propane
oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 to  propylene
 employed
 as a probe
 reaction
 suggested
 that  the  catalytic
 perfor-
mance
 relates
 closely
 with  the  content
 of
 Cr,  the  easily
 reducible
 soluble  Cr species,
 and
 the  modiﬁcation
of
 the  acid  properties
 on  the
 surface,
 while  TiCr0.15 catalyst  performs
 good
 conversion
 and
 selectivity,
with
 a yield
 of  propylene
 near  19%.

 Introduction
After
 the
 discovery
 of
 M41S
 silicate
 materials,
 the
 extension
 of
the
 surfactant
 templating
 procedure
 to
 form
 non-silica
 mesoporous
oxides
 has
 never
 been
 stopped,
 due
 to
 their
 various
 applications
such
 as
 catalysis,
 sorption,
 chemical
 and
 biological
 separation,
 pho-
tonic
 and
 electronic
 devices
 and
 drug
 delivery
 [1,2].
 Among
 these
materials,
 TiO2 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 metal
 oxides
 in
 het-
erogeneous
 catalysis
 because
 of
 its
 broad
 functionality,
 long-term
stability
 and
 nontoxicity.
 High-quality
 mesoporous
 TiO2 can
 now
be
 easily
 and
 reproducibly
 prepared
 [3,4],
 but
 there
 are
 still
 some
disadvantages
 such
 as
 the
 limited
 active
 sites
 on
 its
 surface
 and
 the
aggregation
 of
 its
 mesostructure
 under
 high
 temperatures
 [5,6].
Thus,
 the
 incorporation
 of
 various
 heteroatoms
 into
 the
 meso-
porous
 or
 nano-sized
 structure
 to
 embed
 a
 catalytic
 function
 is
 of
tremendous
 interest
 [7–10].
Catalytic
 dehydrogenation
 represents
 a
 route
 to
 obtain
 oleﬁns
from
 low-cost
 alkanes,
 especially
 propane
 and
 ethane,
 and
 pos-
sesses
 both
 theoretical
 and
 industrial
 signiﬁcance
 [11].
 For
 propane
dehydrogenation,
 vanadium
 and
 molybdenum
 catalysts
 have
 been
extensively
 studied,
 while
 supported
 chromium
 catalysts
 also
show
 competitive
 performance.
 The
 oxidation
 state
 of
 chromium,
structure
 (amorphous
 or
 crystalline,
 chromate
 or
 dichromate)
 and
the
 interaction
 of
 chromium
 with
 the
 support
 are
 the
 main
 factors
that
 determine
 its
 catalytic
 performance.
 More
 interestingly,
 these
factors
 could
 be
 controlled
 by
 varying
 the
 metallic
 content,

precursor,
 the
 support

 and
 calcination
 conditions
[12].
Catalysts
 using
 TiO2 as
 the
 support
 have
 been
 extended
 to
 the
PODH
 reaction
 as
 well
 [13–17].  Moreover,
 for
 chromium
 catalysts,
TiO2 even
 appears
 to
 be
 the
 most
 suitable
 support
 compared
 by
the
 dispersion
 amount
 of
 chromium
 oxide
 on
 different
 supports
and
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 in
 PODH
 [18].
However,
 despite
 having
 great
 potential,
 reports
 about
 the
application
 of
 mesoporous
 Ti–Cr
 materials
 are
 still
 seldom.
 Meso-
porous
 structure
 allows
 the
 reactants
 access
 additional
 active
 sites
in
 the
 pores
 and
 has
 advantages
 in
 mass
 diffusion
 and
 transporta-
tion,
 as
 well
 as
 other
 unpredicted
 beneﬁcial
 properties,
 which
 may
improve
 catalytic
 activity.
In
 view
 of
 the
 above,
 it
 is
 quite
 interesting
 for
 us
 to
 synthe-
size
 mesoporous
 materials
 and
 test
 their
 catalytic
 performance
in
 PODH
 reaction.
 In
 this
 work,
 we
 prepared
 a
 series
 of
 Ti–Cr
oxide
 catalysts
 and
 studied
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 Cr
 content
 on
 meso-
pores
 (surface
 area,
 pore
 volume
 and
 stability),
 surface
 properties
(chromium
 valence
 distribution,
 reducibility,
 and
 acid
 property
 of
the
 chromium
 species)
 and
 catalytic
 performance
 (propane
 con-
version,
 yield
 to
 propylene)
 of
 these
 catalysts.
 Attempts
 have
 been
made
 to
 correlate
 the
 PODH
 results
 with
 the
 composition
 of
 the
catalysts
 and
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 active
 sites.

 catalysts
 with
 different
 Cr
 contents
 are
 denoted
as
 TiCrx,
 where

 In
 a
 typical
synthesis
 of
 TiCr0.15,
 15
 mmol
 of
 Ti(OBu)4,
 60
 mmol
 of
 HOAc,
18

 (EO96PO70EO96,
 MW

 g/mol)
 were
 dissolved
 in
 45
 ml
ethanol
 solution.
 After
 vigorously
 stirred
 for
 60
 min,
 the
 transpar-

 was
 transferred
 to
 a
 Petri
 dish
 (diameter
 90
 mm),
and
 evaporated
 at
 40 ◦C
 for
 12
 h
 until
 a
 blue

formed.
 Then
 the
 temperature
 increased
 to
 65 ◦C
 and
 maintained
24

 The
 obtained
 dried
 blue
 membrane
 was
 calcined
 at
 350 ◦C
in
 air
 for
 5
 h
 with
 a
 ramping

 Another
 TiCr0.15

 was
 calcined
 at
 540 ◦C
 for
 5
 h
 in
 air
 for
 comparison,
 and
it
 was
 denoted
 as

TiCr0.15-impregnation
 catalyst,
 commercial
 TiO2 (from
 Shanghai

 with
 BET

 used
as
 the

 Corresponding
 amount
 of
 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O
 (molar

The
 resulting

 was
 added
 dropwise
 to
 the

 After
impregnation
 for
 overnight,
 the

 characterization
Powder
 XRD
 patterns
 of
 the
 samples
 were
 obtained
 on
 an
 X-ray
diffractometer
 (XRD,
 Rigaku-D/Max-B
 automated
 powder
 X-ray
diffractometer)
 operating
 at
 45
 kV
 and
 40
 mA  using
 Cu
 K
 radia-
tion
 (
 =
 0.15418
 nm).
 The
 pore
 structure
 was
 determined
 by
 small
angle
 scanning
 in
 2
 range
 of
 0.6–10◦,
 and
 the
 crystal
 phase
 was
obtained
 by
 wide-angle
 scanning
 in
 2
 range
 of
 10–80◦.
The
 N2 adsorption–desorption
 isotherms
 were
 recorded
 on
 a
TriStar
 II
 3020
 V1.03
 instrument
 at
 77
 K.
 Before
 the
 measure-
ment,
 the
 samples
 were
 evacuated
 at
 473
 K
 for
 2
 h.
 The
 total
surface
 area
 was
 determined
 by
 the
 Braunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET)
 method,
 and
 the
 pore
 size
 distributions
 were
 calculated
 using
the
 Barrett–Joyner–Halender
 (BJH)
 model.
Transmission
 electron
 microscopic
 (TEM)
 images
 were
 obtained
over
 a
 JEM-2100
 instrument
 operating
 at
 200
 kV.
X-ray
 photoelectron
 spectroscopy
 (XPS)
 experiments
 were
 car-
ried
 out
 on
 a
 Thermo
 ESCALAB
 250
 system
 with
 Al
 K
 radiation
(h
 =
 1486.6
 eV).
 The
 X-ray
 anode
 was
 run
 at
 150
 W,
 and
 bind-
ing
 energies
 were
 calibrated
 using
 the
 C
 1s
 line
 as
 a
 standard
(284.8
 eV).
The
 ultraviolet–visible
 (UV–vis)
 spectra
 of
 the
 samples
 in
 the
range
 of
 200–800
 nm
 were
 measured
 on
 a
 UV–vis
 spectrophotome-
ter
 (Shimadzu
 UV
 2450)
 using
 BaSO4 as
 standard.
H2-temperature
 programed
 reduction
 (TPR)
 experiments
 were
carried
 out
 in
 a
 ﬂow
 reactor
 system
 using
 20
 mg
 of
 catalysts.
 The
sample
 was
 reduced
 in
 a
 10%
 H2/Ar
 stream
 (40
 ml/min)
 with
 a
heating
 rate
 of
 10 ◦C/min
 from
 100
 to
 600 ◦C.
 H2 consumption
 was
measured
 by
 TCD.
The
 acid
 character
 of
 the
 catalysts
 were
 studied
 by
 the
temperature-programed
 desorption
 of
 ammonia
 (NH3-TPD).
 All
catalysts
 
were
 
pretreated
 
in
 
Ar
 
at
 
300 ◦C
 
for
 
30
 min
 
and
chemisorbed
 under
 NH3 when
 the
 temperature
 cooled
 to
 50 ◦C.
After
 purging
 the
 reactor
 with
 Ar
 for
 1
 h,
 the
 experiments
 were
carried
 out
 with
 a
 heating
 rate
 of
 10 ◦C/min
 from
 50
 to
 600 ◦C.
 The
desorption
 of
 NH3 was
 analyzed
 by
 TCD.
 Surface
 acidity
 proper-
ties
 were
 also
 determined
 by
 FT-IR
 monitoring
 of
 adsorption
 of
pyridine
 in
 a
 Perkin-Elmer
 16PC
 spectrometer.
 After
 outgassing,
the
 probe
 molecule
 was
 adsorbed
 at
 room
 temperature
 and
 a
spectrum
 was
 recorded.
 Further
 spectra
 were
 recorded
 after
 out-
gassing
 at
 increasing
 temperature
 from
 room
 temperature
 to
573
 K.
The
 PODH
 reaction
 was
 carried
 out
 in
 a
 tubular
 ﬁxed
 bed
ﬂow
 quartz
 reactor
 (i.d.
 7.4
 mm,
 270
 mm  long)
 under
 atmo-
sphere
 pressure.
 In
 a
 typical
 condition,
 the
 reaction
 was
 tested
 at
540 ◦C,
 GHSV
 =
 4500
 ml
 (g

 Propane/O2 molar
 ratio
 =

 The
feedstock
 and
 reaction
 products
 were
 analyzed
 on-line
 by
 gas
 chro-
matography
 with
 two
 column
 types:
 Porapak

 Results
3.1.
 Catalytic
 performance
 for
 PODH
Table
 1
 presents
 the
 performance
 for
 PODH
 reaction
 on
 meso-
porous
 Ti–Cr
 catalysts.
 It
 can
 be
 seen
 that
 the
 conversion
 of
 propane
increases
 from
 19.2%
 to
 57.3%
 as
 the
 Cr/Ti
 ratio
 increases
 from
 0.02
to
 0.20,
 while
 in
 TiCr0.30 the
 conversion
 decreases.
 The
 selectivity
of
 propylene
 shows
 almost
 the
 reverse
 trend
 as
 conversion,
 but
is
 always
 above
 40%
 before
 TiCr0.15.
 These
 results
 indicate
 that
 Cr
species
 in
 the
 mesoporous
 Ti–Cr
 catalysts
 have
 a
 great
 effect
 on
the
 reaction.
 In
 TiCr0.15-impregnation
 catalyst,
 the
 conversion
 is
extremely
 high
 to
 65%,
 but
 the
 selectivity
 of
 propylene
 is
 consider-
ably
 low.
 Evolution
 of
 catalytic
 performances
 with
 time
 for
 TiCr0.15
catalyst
 is
 presented
 in
 Fig.
 1A.
 The
 propylene
 selectivity
 increases
slightly
 at
 the
 ﬁrst
 100
 min
 and
 then
 reaches
 a
 steady
 state.
 Averag-
ing
 the
 experimental
 point,
 the
 propylene
 selectivity
 is
 43.2%
 with
propane
 conversion
 of
 43.8%
 over
 the
 TiCr0.15 catalyst.
Fig.
 1B
 shows
 propylene
 selectivity
 as
 a
 function
 of
 propane
conversion
 varied
 by
 contact
 time
 on
 TiCr0.15 and
 TiCr0.15-
impregnation
 catalysts.
 As
 can
 be
 seen,
 the
 propylene
 selectivity
decreases
 with
 the
 increase
 of
 propane
 conversion,
 which
 testiﬁes
the
 consecutive
 reaction
 of
 propylene
 degradation.
 It
 is
 also
 appar-
ently
 that
 the
 mesoporous
 sample
 is
 favored
 for
 higher
 propylene
selectivity
 at
 the
 same
 conversion.
Fig.
 1C
 presents
 the
 catalytic
 performances
 of
 TiCr0.15 cata-
lyst
 under
 the
 different
 reactive
 conditions
 (propane/oxygen
 ratio,
GHSV
 and
 temperature).
 High
 oxygen
 partial
 pressure
 leads
 to
great
 activity
 but
 COx dominating
 in
 the
 products.
 Increasing
 the
propane/oxygen
 molar
 ratio
 to
 3:1
 favors
 selective
 oxidation
 prod-
ucts.
 In
 addition,
 catalysts
 in
 low
 GHSV
 and
 high
 temperature
 show
high
 activity
 but
 low
 selectivity
 of
 propylene.
 Based
 upon
 the
 activ-
ity
 and
 selectivity,
 propane/oxygen
 molar
 ratio
 of
 2:1,
 GHSV
 of
4500
 ml
 (g
 h)−1 and
 the
 reaction
 temperature
 of
 540 ◦C
 have
 been
chosen
 to
 be
 the
 best
 reaction
 conditions.
3.2.
 Formation
 of
 mesopores
The
 N2 adsorption–desorption
 isotherm
 and
 BJH
 pore-size
 dis-
tribution
 of
 several
 Ti–Cr
 catalysts
 are
 presented
 in
 Fig.
 2.
 The
hysteresis
 loop
 between
 partial
 pressures
 (p/p0)
 of
 0.4
 and
 0.8
 for
the
 as-made
 TiO2 shows
 typical
 type-IV
 isotherm,
 indicating
 meso-
porous
 TiO2 has
 been
 successfully
 synthesized.
 Cr-incorporated
samples
 also
 display
 type-IV
 isotherm
 and
 they
 are
 of
 mesoporous
materials
 too.
 As
 can
 be
 seen
 from
 Table
 2,
 all
 the
 samples
 exhibited
reasonably
 high
 BET
 surface
 area
 in
 the
 range
 of
 200–330
 m2 g−1.
The
 doping
 of
 Cr
 causes
 a
 considerable
 increase
 of
 the
 surface
 area
from
 TiCr0.06 to
 TiCr0.30,
 and
 the
 pore
 volumes
 increase
 except
 for
TiCr0.06.
 The
 above
 results
 suggest
 that
 appropriate
 incorporation
of
 Cr
 makes
 no
 perturbation
 on
 the
 mesostructure
 of
 TiO2.
 The
 sur-
face
 area
 and
 pore
 volume
 of
 the
 TiCr0.15 catalyst
 decreased
 after
used
 for
 the
 PODH
 reaction,
 which
 illuminates
 aggregation
 occurs
in
 the
 reaction
 conditions
 and
 some
 channels
 are
 blocked.
 How-
ever,
 the
 mesostructure
 is
 largely
 preserved
 as
 it
 still
 keeps
 type-IV
isotherm.
 Compared
 with
 that
 of
 the
 above
 catalyst,
 surface
 area
of
 the
 TiCr0.15 catalyst
 calcined
 at
 540 ◦C
 in
 air
 reduced
 greatly
(56
 cm2 g−1),
 indicating
 the
 mesopores
 are
 largely
 destroyed.

 which
can
 be
 indexed
 to
 the
 TiO2 anatase
 phase
 (JCPDS

 86-1157).
No

 and

 After
 the
 PODH
reaction,
 only
 anatase
 was
 detected
 (Fig.
 5g)
 in
 the
 mesoporous
TiCr0.15 catalyst,
 indicating
 no
 transformation
 from
 anatase
 to
 rutile
occurred
 during
 the
 catalytic
 process.
 The
 anatase
 peaks
 of
 the
sample
 prepared
 by
 impregnation
 are
 sharp
 and
 intense
 (Fig.
 5a),
while
 those
 of
 the
 mesoporous
 samples
 are
 relatively
 broad
 and
 less
resolved,
 illustrating
 that
 the
 mesoporous
 samples
 possess
 worse
crystal
 phase
 of
 anatase.
 Typical
 crystal
 Cr2O3 is
 detected
 in
 the
TiCr0.15-impregnation
 catalyst,
 but
 the
 phase
 is
 only
 detected
 in
 the
mesoporous
 sample
 with
 Cr/Ti
 molar
 ratio
 of
 0.30,
 indicating
 that
the
 EISA
 method
 is
 propitious
 to
 Cr
 dispersion
 and
 less
 organized
stacking
 arrangement
 of
 the
 Cr
 species.
XPS
 results
 of
 the
 mesoporous
 Ti–Cr
 catalysts
 reveal
 the
 pres-
ence
 of
 only
 Cr,
 Ti,
 O,
 and
 C
 on
 the
 surface.
 As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 6A,
the
 deconvoluted
 Cr
 2p3/2
 proﬁles
 of
 the
 four
 catalysts
 indicate
there
 are
 multiple
 oxidation
 states.
 Binding
 energies
 of
 579.6,
 578.9,
578.0,
 577.1,
 576.1
 eV
 were
 obtained
 and
 could
 be
 accounted
 for
Cr(VI,
 V,
 IV,
 III,
 II),
 respectively
 [19].
 The
 Cr/(Cr
 +
 Ti)
 atomic
 ratios
on
 the
 surface
 are
 also
 displayed
 in
 Table
 3.
 It
 is
 observed
 that
 the
value
 of
 Cr/(Cr
 +
 Ti)
 increases
 greatly
 from
 TiCr0.06 to
 TiCr0.15 and
then
 retains
 immovability
 basically
 between
 TiCr0.15 and
 TiCr0.30.
Fig.
 6B
 summarizes
 the
 distribution
 of
 different
 Cr
 valance
 states
with
 increasing
 Cr
 content.
 In
 all
 the
 catalysts,
 Cr(VI)
 and
 Cr(III)
are
 dominating
 on
 the
 surface.
 However,
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 TiCr0.06
catalyst,
 the
 sum
 of
 Cr(V),
 Cr(IV)
 and
 Cr(II)
 states
 still
 accounts
 for
almost
 25%,
 while
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 TiCr0.20 catalyst,
 Cr(V)
 and
 Cr(IV)
disappear.
Fig.
 7
 shows
 the
 UV–vis
 absorption
 spectra
 of
 the
 samples
with
 increasing
 Cr
 content.
 Similar
 to
 previous
 report
 [20],
 the
absorption
 edge
 of
 mesoporous
 TiO2 is
 at
 around
 400
 nm.
 Reports
have
 shown
 that
 crystal
 Cr2O3 gives
 main
 absorptions
 at
 around
450–465
 nm,
 and
 601
 nm.
 For
 Cr2O3,
 the
 450–465
 nm
 bands
 are
related
 to
 the
 O
 Cr(III)
 charge
 transfer,
 and
 580–600
 nm
 are
 related
to
 d–d
 transitions
 of
 Cr(III)
 in
 octahedral
 symmetry,
 respectively
[21].
 However,
 the
 former
 band
 may
 be
 overlapping
 with
 the
absorption
 caused
 by
 symmetry
 forbidden
 Cr(VI)
 in
 Td coordination
when
 Cr(VI)
 coexist.
From
 Fig.
 7,
 all
 catalysts
 show
 UV
 absorptions
 of
 TiO2 and
 addi-
tional
 bands
 of
 455–470
 nm
 and
 600
 nm
 or
 710
 nm.
 The
 bands
 of
the
 mesoporous
 samples
 (from
 c
 to
 g)
 are
 broad
 and
 less
 resolved,
indicating
 the
 forming
 of
 oxygen
 vacancies
 or
 the
 distortion
 of
 the
polymeric
 chromate
 species
 [22].
 The
 band
 of
 370
 nm
 is
 character-
istic
 of
 the
 Cr6+
O2−charge
 transfer
 transition
 [23].
 Nevertheless,
it
 may
 be
 masked
 by
 the
 strong
 absorption
 of
 TiO2 in
 this
 region.
The
 assignment
 of
 the
 455–470
 nm
 bands
 in
 Cr
 catalysts
 has
 been
a
 point
 of
 discussion
 [24,25]. In
 this
 experiment,
 we
 consider
 it
 to
be
 caused
 by
 both
 symmetry
 forbidden
 Cr(VI)
 in
 Td coordination
and
 Cr(III)
 in
 octahedral
 coordination,
 as
 they
 are
 difﬁcult
 to
 be
excluded.
 The
 absorption
 of
 symmetry
 forbidden
 Cr(VI)
 depends
upon
 the
 distortion
 of
 surface
 Cr
 species,
 and
 it
 appears
 when
 the
degree
 of
 aggregation
 increases.
 Compared
 with
 the
 impregnated
one,
 the
 band
 at
 580–600
 nm,
 which
 is
 indicative
 of
 polymerized
Cr(III)
 in
 high
 Cr
 content
 catalyst,
 vanishes
 in
 all
 mesoporous
 sam-
ples,
 and
 the
 band
 at
 about
 710
 nm
 appears.
 It
 could
 suggest
 that
absorption
 of
 Cr(III)
 species
 in
 the
 mesoporous
 samples
 has
 a
 red-
shift
 as
 the
 interaction
 of
 Cr(III)
 species
 with
 Ti
 oxide.
 All
 of
 the
mesoporous
 catalysts
 show
 this
 band,
 indicating
 Cr
 species
 easily
aggregate
 on
 the
 surface.

 properties
 characterization
Fig.

 shows
 the
 H2-TPR
 proﬁles
 of
 the
 mesoporous
 Ti–Cr
 cat-
alysts.
 The
 high
 valance
 states
 of
 Cr(VI,
 V,
 IV)
 can
 be
 reduced
 to
Cr(III)
 by
 H2 [12].
 As
 mesoporous
 TiO2 gives
 no
 reduction
 in
 this
region,
 there
 are
 mainly
 Cr(III)
 on
 the
 surface
 after
 the
 H2-TPR
experiment.
 TiCr0.06 catalyst
 contains
 two
 reduction
 peaks
 at
 295 ◦C
(low
 temperature
 reduction
 peak,
 LR)
 and
 336 ◦C
 (high
 temperature
reduction
 peak,
 HR).
 They
 are
 attributed
 to
 the
 reduction
 of
 two
kinds
 of
 Cr(VI)
 species,
 the
 soluble
 and
 the
 grafted
 Cr(VI),
 respec-
tively,
 to
 Cr(III)
 [23].
 The
 soluble
 Cr(VI)
 are
 easier
 to
 be
 reduced
than
 the
 grafted
 Cr(VI),
 since
 the
 latter
 always
 present
 as
 isolated
chromates
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 catalyst
 and
 offer
 greater
 interaction
with
 the
 bulk
 TiO2 [25].
 Based
 on
 the
 above,
 the
 HR
 corresponds
 to
the
 reduction
 of
 grafted
 Cr(VI)
 species
 and
 the
 LR
 may
 result
 from
reduction
 of
 soluble
 Cr(VI).
It
 can
 be
 seen
 that
 with
 the
 increase
 of
 Cr,
 the
 HR
 shifts
 to
 lower
temperature,
 while
 LR
 hardly
 moves.
 Meanwhile,
 the
 amount
 of
H2 consumption
 by
 TPR
 increases
 up
 to
 TiCr0.20 catalyst
 (Table
 3).
It
 may
 be
 that
 the
 degree
 of
 aggregation
 increases
 as
 the
 Cr/Ti
molar
 ratio
 increases
 and
 results
 in
 larger
 amount
 of
 soluble
 Cr(VI)
species.
 The
 amount
 of
 H2 consumption
 for
 the
 TiCr0.20 catalyst
 is
almost
 equivalent
 to
 that
 of
 TiCr0.30 catalyst.
 As
 Cr(III)
 can
 hardly
be
 reduced
 by
 H2,
 the
 relative
 constant
 value
 of
 H2 consumption
could
 speculate
 out
 that
 the
 excess
 Cr
 (compared
 with
 Cr/Ti
 =
 0.20)
in
 this
 region
 are
 more
 favorable
 to
 form
 Cr(III).

 total
 amount
 of
 surface
 acidity

nia

 in

 with
 previous
report
 [20].
 Mesoporous
 Cr
 doped
 samples
 have
 desorption
 band
mainly
 lied
 between
 160
 and
 400 ◦C.
 The
 acid
 amount
 in
 this

 increases
 greatly
 with
 the
 addition
 of
 Cr
 and
 arrives
 almost
the
 maximal
 in
 TiCr0.30,
 while
 there
 is
 hardly
 change
 in
 the
 acid
strength.
 The
 TiCr0.15-impregnation
 catalyst
 shows
 mainly
 desorp-
tion
 temperature
 between
 500

 its
 much

 the

 by
 Cr
species.
 It

In

 to
 give
 some
 information
 about
 the
 nature
 of

[26].
 In
 addition,
 two
 peaks
 at
 1640
 and
 1540
 cm−1 exist
 and
 the
intensity
 increases
 from
 TiCr0.06 to
 TiCr0.20.
 As
 Ti
 oxide
 sample
 has
negligible
 Brønsted
 acid
 sites,
 the
 peaks
 demonstrate
 the
 addition
of
 Cr
 leads
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 Brønsted
 acid
 sites,
 in
 accord
 with
 the
reports
 [27]
 [28].
 In
 the
 300 ◦C
 outgassing
 ones,
 the
 intensity
 of
 the
1445
 and
 1605
 cm−1 bands
 is
 quite
 similar
 with
 the
 r.t.
 outgassing
samples,
 while
 the
 intensity
 at
 the
 1575
 cm−1 is
 much
 weaker.
 It
indicates
 that
 the
 sites
 locating
 at
 1445
 and
 1605
 cm−1 are
 strong
Lewis
 acid
 centers
 and
 at
 1575
 cm−1 is
 weak

 Sim-
ilarly,

 at
 the
 1540
 cm−1 and
 1640

 largely
 absent
 in
the
 300 ◦C

 indicating
 they
 are
 weak
 Brønsted
acid
 sites.
 A
 new
 band
 at
 1473
 cm−1 appears
 in
 the
 spectra
 of
 300 ◦C
outgassing
 one,
 this
 can
 be

 Discussion
4.1.
 Stability
 of
 the
 mesostructure
Based
 on
 the
 BET,
 SAXS
 and
 TEM
 results,
 it
 can
 be
 concluded
that
 the
 as-synthesized
 materials
 have
 high
 surface
 area
 and
 disor-
dered
 mesopores,
 which
 can
 still
 be
 detected
 in
 Cr
 content
 as
 high
as
 Cr/Ti
 =
 0.30
 (molar
 ratio).
 Mesoporous
 TiO2 was
 always
 calcined
at
 temperatures
 below
 400 ◦C
 during
 the
 preparation
 process
 and
was
 employed
 to
 a
 reaction
 at
 the
 temperature
 below
 [29].
 In
 this
experiment,
 the
 best
 catalytic
 performance
 was
 obtained
 at
 reac-
tion
 temperature
 of
 540 ◦C,
 while
 the
 TiCr0.15 catalyst
 was
 prepared
only
 calcined
 at
 350 ◦C.
 Despite
 the
 high
 reaction
 temperature,
 the
mesoporous
 structure
 is
 mainly
 preserved
 as
 can
 be
 seen
 from
 the
BET
 and
 SAXS
 results,
 although
 certain
 degree
 of
 aggregation
 may
block
 some
 of
 the
 pores.
 The
 incorporation
 of
 Cr
 may
 have
 an
 effect
on
 the
 phase
 transformation
 from
 anatase
 to
 rutile,
 as
 well
 as
 the
stability
 of
 the
 mesopores
 [30].
 All
 of
 the
 catalysts
 are
 calcined
 and
mainly
 tested
 below
 550 ◦C,
 which
 is
 considered
 to
 be
 the
 beginning
phase
 transformation
 temperature
 [31],
 and
 the
 transformation
from
 anatase
 to
 rutile
 has
 not
 been
 detected
 in
 our
 experiment
 (Fig.
5).
 In
 order
 to
 expound
 why
 the
 mesostructure
 is
 stable
 under
 the
reaction
 conditions,
 the
 catalyst
 with
 the
 same
 Cr
 content
 was
 pre-
pared
 at
 temperature
 of
 540 ◦C
 in
 air.
 SAXS
 and
 BET
 results
 showed
that
 the
 catalyst
 suffered
 largely
 aggregation
 of
 the
 mesopores
 and
had
 low
 surface
 area
 (Table
 2).
 It
 indicates
 the
 reaction
 atmosphere
may
 have
 a
 beneﬁcial
 effect
 on
 stabilizing
 the
 structure,
 which
means
 mesostructure
 of
 TiO2 can
 be
 stable
 at
 high
 temperature

4.2.
 Characterizations
 of
 Cr
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 mesopores
 and
 in
the
 bulk
It
 is
 generally
 accepted
 that
 the
 nature
 of
 Cr
 oxide
 depends
strongly
 on
 its
 surface
 density
 and
 the
 speciﬁc
 support
 used
 [32].
In
 this
 experiment,
 several
 methods
 were
 applied
 attempting
 to
elucidate
 the
 existent
 form
 of
 Cr
 species.
 WXRD
 results
 reveal
 the
general
 features
 of
 the
 catalysts,
 and
 the
 patterns
 showed
 only
anatase
 TiO2 diffraction
 until
 up
 to
 TiCr0.30,
 which
 exhibited
 slight
evidence
 of
 -Cr2O3.
 It
 means
 Cr
 species
 are
 well
 dispersed
 in
 large
range
 of
 Cr/Ti
 molar
 ratio.
 In
 view
 of
 the
 synthesis
 approach,
 it
 is
reasonable
 to
 estimate
 that
 part
 of
 the
 doping
 ions
 are
 incorpo-
rated
 into
 the
 framework
 during
 the
 self-assembly
 of
 the
 surfactant.
Because
 the
 ionic
 radii
 of
 Cr(III)
 and
 Ti(IV)
 are
 very
 close
 (0.615 ˚
A
and
 0.605 ˚
A,
 respectively),
 Ti(IV)
 in
 the
 bulk
 may
 be
 replaced
 by
 the
incorporated
 Cr
 ions
 during
 calcination.
 The
 substitution
 of
 Cr(III)
with
 Ti(IV)
 in
 the
 anatase
 structure
 would
 cause
 an
 expansion
 of
the
 Unit
 Cell
 Volume.
 As
 for
 Cr(VI),
 given
 the
 small
 radius
 of
 Cr(VI)
(0.44 ˚
A),
 an
 appreciable
 decrease
 of
 the
 Unit
 Cell
 Volume
 should
be
 produced
 with
 the
 substitution
 of
 Ti(IV)
 by
 Cr(VI).
 To
 prove
 this
point,
 the
 Unit
 Cell
 Volumes
 of
 the
 samples
 analyzed
 by
 XRD
 results
are
 shown
 in
 Table
 3.
 It
 can
 be
 seen
 that
 except
 for
 the
 value
 of
 TiO2
which
 is
 slightly
 smaller,
 all
 the
 other
 samples
 are
 larger
 than
 TiO2,
indicating
 the
 substitution
 of
 Ti(IV)
 by
 Cr(III)
 occurs.
 The
 amount
of
 Cr
 that
 can
 dissolve
 into
 the
 TiO2 structure
 are
 rather
 small
(<Cr/Ti
 =
 0.02,
 molar
 ratio)
 [33],
 while
 the
 doping
 amount
 are
 large
in
 our
 materials.
 The
 Unit
 Cell
 Volumes
 of
 the
 Cr
 doped
 catalysts
are
 relatively
 constant,
 possibly
 illuminating
 that
 the
 substitution
reaches
 the
 limit
 amount
 in
 all
 of
 the
 Cr-doped
 mesoporous
 sam-
ples,
 coincide
 with
 previous
 reports
 [33,34].
 The
 substitution
 can
be
 electrically
 compensated
 for
 by
 oxygen
 vacancies,
 as
 have
 been
discussed
 in
 Section
 3.3
 (UV–vis
 part),
 that
 oxygen
 vacancies
 may
lead
 to
 the
 broad
 band
 of
 the
 UV–vis
 absorption
 in
 Fig.
 7.
According
 to
 reports,
 Cr(VI)
 and
 Cr(III)
 species
 easily
 aggregate
on
 the
 surface
 of
 TiO2 due
 to
 the
 characteristic
 interaction
 of
 Cr
with
 Ti
 oxide
 [35].
 Moreover,
 increasing
 doping
 amount
 leads
 to
 the
larger
 quantity
 of
 reducible
 Cr(VI)
 species.
 In
 our
 catalysts,
 Cr(VI)
are
 polymerized
 as
 can
 be
 seen
 from
 the
 H2-TPR
 measurements
(soluble
 Cr(VI)
 exist
 in
 all
 the
 samples)
 (Fig.
 8).
Compared
 with
 the
 TiCr0.15-impregnation
 catalyst,
 -Cr2O3
forms
 in
 the
 latter
 one
 as
 showed
 in
 Fig.
 5
 (WXRD).
 This
 means
that
 such
 doping
 amount
 of
 chromium
 on
 the
 surface
 is
 far
 above
the
 monolayer
 requirement.
 The
 amount
 of
 monolayer
 coverage
was
 obtained
 to
 be
 ∼4%
 Cr2O3 on
 TiO2 (Cr/Ti
 molar
 ratio
 ≈0.04)
 by
detecting
 Cr2O3 microcrystals,
 which
 can
 be
 considered
 to
 form
when
 the
 molar
 ratio
 of
 Cr/(Cr
 +
 Ti)
 on
 the
 surface
 kept
 a
 con-
stant
 value
 as
 the
 doping
 ions
 increased
 [18].
 In
 this
 experiment
as
 the
 XPS
 results
 show,
 the
 ratio
 of
 Cr/(Cr
 +
 Ti)
 in
 the
 TiCr0.15 and
TiCr0.20 catalysts
 are
 nearly
 the
 same.
 This
 is
 one
 of
 the
 evidences
that
 such
 doping
 amount
 achieves
 approximately
 the
 monolayer
coverage
 of
 polymerized
 Cr
 species
 on
 the
 surface.
 It
 may
 also
 be
consolidated
 by
 the
 H2-TPR
 results,
 as
 the
 hydrogen
 consumption
remained
 almost
 constant
 between
 TiCr0.20 and
 TiCr0.30 (Table
 3),
indicating
 that
 the
 increased
 doping
 of
 Cr
 mainly
 forms
 hardly
reducible
 crystal
 Cr(III)
 species
 from
 TiCr0.20.
 The
 monolayer
 cover-
age
 is
 determined
 to
 be
 in
 TiCr0.15,
 and
 Cr
 species
 in
 TiCr0.06 is
 about
40%
 of
 the
 monolayer
 coverage,
 in
 which
 polymerized
 Cr(III)
 species
are
 difﬁcult
 to
 be
 excluded.
 As
 Cr2O3 has
 been
 detected
 in
 TiCr0.30,
the
 degree
 of
 polymerization
 for
 Cr(III)
 should
 be
 increasing
 from
Cr/Ti
 =
 0.06
 to
 0.20.
Thus
 the
 likely
 picture
 is
 that
 before
 the
 formation
 of
 Cr2O3,
some
 of
 the
 Cr
 species
 are
 polymerized,
 randomly
 dispersed
 and
possibly
 amorphous
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 mesopores,
 while
 a
 solid
solution
 is
 formed
 inside
 the
 walls.
 Such
 structure
 may
 be
 signif-
icant
 for
 its
 performance
 in
 the
 PODH
 reaction
 especially
 when
 it
reaches
 monolayer
 coverage
 of
 the
 doping
 species.

 Correlation
 of
 catalytic
 performance
 with
 Cr
 species
In
 propane
 direct
 dehydrogenation
 using
 Cr
 species
 as
 the
 cata-
lysts,
 the
 active
 species
 are
 believed
 to
 be
 coordination
 unsaturated
Cr(III)
 ions,
 whereas
 the
 bulk
 Cr(III)
 ions
 with
 a
 perfect
 and
 sta-
ble
 octahedral
 surrounding
 are
 inactive
 [36].
 With
 oxidant,
 the
complicated
 reactions
 make
 it
 difﬁcult
 to
 ﬁnd
 a
 straightforward
correlation
 between
 catalytic
 performance
 and
 speciﬁc
 properties
of
 the
 mesoporous
 materials.
As
 discussed
 above,
 polymerized
 Cr
 species
 (Cr
 O
 Cr)
 gradually
forms
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 samples
 and
 then
 -Cr2O3 is
 detected.
Correlated
 with
 the
 increased
 catalytic
 performance
 presented
 in
Table
 1,
 it
 may
 be
 suggested
 that
 the
 active
 sites
 are
 closely
 related
to
 the
 degree
 of
 polymerization
 of
 Cr
 species
 on
 the
 surface.
 The
conversion
 of
 propane
 increases
 gradually
 from
 19.2%
 to
 57.3%
with
 the
 addition
 of
 Cr
 content
 from
 TiCr0.02 to
 TiCr0.20.
 Meantime,
polymerized
 Cr(VI)
 and
 Cr(III)
 species
 on
 the
 surface
 also
 augment,
indicating
 they
 should
 be
 beneﬁcial
 for
 the
 catalytic
 performance.
The
 catalyst
 of
 TiCr0.15-impregnation
 which
 contained
 relatively
amount
 of
 -Cr2O3 (Cr(III))
 on
 the
 surface
 exhibits
 the
 highest
 con-
version
 of
 propane
 and
 the
 value
 is
 larger
 than
 the
 mesoporous
TiCr0.15 catalyst
 by
 20%,
 although
 its
 selectivity
 of
 propylene
 is
lower.
 It
 implies
 that
 Cr(III)
 species
 is
 responsible
 for
 the
 conver-
sion
 of
 propane.
 The
 higher
 degree
 of
 polymerization
 of
 the
 Cr(III)
species,
 the
 better
 for
 the
 conversion
 of
 propane.
 Contrarily,
 the
selectivity
 of
 propylene
 decreases
 gradually
 from
 55.3%
 to
 33.2%
with
 the
 addition
 of
 Cr
 content.
 It
 also
 indicates
 that
 the
 polymeric
Cr(III)
 species
 is
 disadvantageous
 to
 the
 selectivity,
 and
 the
 higher
degree
 of
 polymerization
 of
 the
 Cr(III)
 species,
 the
 worse
 for
 the
selectivity
 of
 propylene.
As
 can
 be
 seen
 from
 XPS
 results,
 Cr
 species
 is
 present
 in
 multi-
ple
 oxidation
 states,
 while
 Cr(VI)
 and
 Cr(III)
 account
 for
 over
 75%.
In
 low
 Cr
 content
 catalysts
 as
 TiCr0.06,
 Cr(VI)
 species
 is
 prevailing
on
 the
 surface
 and
 the
 catalyst
 has
 high
 selectivity
 of
 propylene.
The
 selectivity
 descends
 with
 the
 decreasing
 proportion
 of
 Cr(VI)
species
 on
 the
 surface
 when
 the
 addition
 of
 Cr
 content
 increases,
which
 suggests
 that
 high
 dispersive
 Cr(VI)
 species
 is
 propitious
to
 the
 selectivity.
 So
 the
 best
 performance
 of
 the
 catalysts
 needs
appropriate
 Cr(III)/Cr(VI)
 molar
 ratio.
The
 redox
 cycle
 between
 Cr(VI)
 and
 Cr(III)
 played
 an
 important
role
 in
 the
 PODH
 reaction
 [37].
 The
 polymerized
 Cr(VI)
 species
 are
easily
 reducible
 as
 conﬁrmed
 by
 the
 TPR
 results,
 possibly
 because
of
 the
 weak
 Cr
 O
 Ti
 bond
 [38].
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 Cr(III)
 species
on
 TiO2 are
 easily
 oxidized
 to
 higher
 oxidation
 states,
 due
 to
 low
activation
 energy
 of
 the
 oxidation
 and
 strong
 capability
 of
 electron
transfer
 over
 CrOx/TiO2 [39].
 Therefore,
 the
 polymeric
 chromate
species
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 mesoporous
 CrOx/TiO2 catalysts
 are
 of
better
 redox
 capability.
 During
 the
 PODH
 reaction,
 the
 redox
 pro-
cess
 in
 which
 large
 amount
 of
 polymerized
 chromium
 species
 were
reduced
 by
 propane
 and
 were
 oxidized
 by
 oxygen
 made
 the
 reac-
tion
 carry
 out
 more
 facile,
 which
 could
 be
 one
 of
 the
 reason
 why
high
 catalytic
 activity
 can
 be
 obtained
 after
 Cr
 added
 into
 meso-
porous
 TiO2.
In
 addition
 to
 the
 redox
 capability,
 the
 acid
 properties
 exhibited
on
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 catalysts
 were
 believed
 to
 have
 considerable
effect
 on
 the
 performance
 in
 PODH
 reaction.
 In
 our
 experiments,
TiCr0.15-impregnation
 catalyst
 exhibited
 much
 higher
 catalytic
activity
 than
 the
 mesoporous
 TiCr0.15 catalyst
 in
 the
 same
 test
 con-
dition.
 It
 seems
 inconsistent
 with
 the
 discussion
 above
 as
 -Cr2O3
is
 mainly
 detected
 in
 the
 TiCr0.15-impregnation
 catalyst
 and
 coor-
dination
 saturated
 Cr
 in
 -Cr2O3 is
 believed
 to
 be
 inactive.
 This
 may
be
 explained
 by
 the
 acid
 properties:
 the
 existence
 of
 extremely
strong
 acid
 sites
 results
 in
 a
 large
 number
 of
 cracking
 products
(Table
 1).
 Combined
 with
 the
 discussion
 above,
 we  may
 speculate
that
 such
 acid
 sites
 are
 related
 to
 the
 Cr(III),
 though
 it
 needs
 further
deducing.
 The
 case
 is
 quite
 different
 in
 the
 mesoporous
 catalysts,
since
 the
 nature
 and
 strength
 of
 the
 acid
 sites
 have
 been
 greatly
modiﬁed
 by
 the
 interaction
 of
 Cr
 and
 Ti
 in
 mesoporous
 structure,
leading
 to
 the
 change
 of
 catalytic
 performance.
 A
 large
 amount
 of
Lewis
 acid
 sites
 with
 relative
 weak
 acid
 strength,
 possibly
 caused
 by
the
 high
 surface
 area
 and
 better
 dispersion
 of
 the
 active
 sites,
 aug-
ment
 with
 the
 addition
 of
 Cr.
 At
 that
 time,
 the
 conversion
 of
 propane
also
 rises.
 Although
 the
 addition
 of
 Cr
 produces
 Brønsted
 acid
 sites
which
 are
 always
 considered
 beneﬁcial
 for
 desorption
 of
 propy-
lene,
 the
 low
 strength
 and
 the
 small
 amount
 of
 these
 sites
 make
 it
difﬁcult
 to
 availably
 affect
 the
 selectivity
 of
 propylene,
 especially
at
 high
 temperature.
 Therefore,
 the
 amount
 and
 strength
 of
 Lewis
acid
 are
 one
 of
 the
 reasons,
 which
 are
 responsible
 for
 the
 increase
 of
the
 propane
 conversion
 and
 decrease
 of
 the
 propylene
 selectivity.
5.
 Conclusion
The
 as-synthesized
 materials
 exhibit
 large
 surface
 area
 of
200–300
 m2 g−1 and
 the
 mesostructure
 is
 relatively
 stable
 in
 large
incorporation
 of
 Cr
 content
 (TiCr0.30)
 and
 high
 temperatures
 (as
high
 as
 540 ◦C).
 The
 doping
 Cr
 ions
 dispersed
 well
 as
 Cr
 O
 Cr
 poly-
merized
 species
 on
 the
 surface,
 while
 in
 the
 bulk
 they
 form
 a
 solid
solution
 with
 Ti
 oxide.
 TiCr0.15 catalyst
 with
 around
 monolayer
 cov-
erage
 of
 Cr
 species
 gives
 the
 best
 catalytic
 performance,
 and
 the
propylene
 selectivity
 was
 signiﬁcantly
 enhanced
 compared
 with
the
 one
 prepared
 by
 impregnation.
 Prevailing
 proportion
 of
 Cr(III)
on
 the
 surface
 seems
 favorable
 for
 the
 conversion
 of
 propane,
 while
Cr(VI)
 could
 make
 for
 the
 selectivity
 of
 propylene:
 the
 best
 perfor-
mance
 needs
 appropriate
 Cr(III)/Cr(VI)
 molar
 ratio.
 The
 reaction
 is
affected
 by
 complicated
 factors,
 and
 the
 acid
 properties
 seem
 cru-
cial
 as
 well.
 The
 Lewis
 acid
 sites
 whose
 amount
 increased
 with
 the
doping
 ions
 may
 account
 for
 the
 high
 activity,
 but
 also
 cause
 the
relative
 low
 selectivity
 to
 propylene.
 Our
 next
 interest
 is
 the
 quan-
titative
 import
 of
 alkali
 metals
 to
 modulate
 the
 acid
 amount.
 In
addition,
 it
 may
 be
 meaningful
 to
 explore
 effective
 steps
 to
 increase
the
 strength
 of
 the
 Brønsted
 acid
 sites
 produced
 by
 the
 incorpo-
rated
 Cr
 species.
 As
 TiO2′ electronic
 property
 is
 greatly
 affected
 by
the
 doping
 ions,
 the
 as-synthesized
 mesoporous
 materials
 could
also
 exhibit
 advantage
 in
 photocatalytic
 reactions,
 such
 as
 the
 pho-
todegradation
 of
 phenol,
 and
 selective
 catalytic
 reduction
 (SCR)
 of
nitric
 oxide
 by
 ammonia.
