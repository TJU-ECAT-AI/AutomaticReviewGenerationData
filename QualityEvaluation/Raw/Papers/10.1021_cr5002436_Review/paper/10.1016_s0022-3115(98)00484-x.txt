Abstract
The thermodynamics of gallium oxide vaporization and deposition in Ar±6% H2 at elevated temperatures are de-
scribed. It is shown that Ga2O3 vaporizes in H2 as Ga2O(g) at elevated temperatures. During thermal processing the
Ga2O(g) moves to cooler zones of the furnace, back reacts with H2(g) and H2O(g) and condenses out as Ga(l) and
Ga2O3(s). Upon removal from the furnace, the exposed Ga forms a ubiquitous surface oxide of Ga2O3. X-ray pho-
toelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to examine heat treated Ga2O3 powders and vaporization products deposited
onto SiO2 and Cu substrates. In agreement with the thermodynamic predictions, these data demonstrate that the de-
position product contained Ga2O3 and metallic Ga. Analysis of the XPS spectra also revealed an intermediate oxidation
state for Ga. The precise bonding of this state could not be demonstrated conclusively, but it is suggested that it may be
solid Ga2O. For coherent product deposition on Cu the metallic Ga concentration increases and the Ga2O3 concen-
tration decreases with sputtering depth, suggesting the metallic Ga in the outermost layers of the deposit is readily
oxidized during air exposure.

1. Introduction
There is currently interest in burning weapons grade
plutonium in nuclear reactors, making use of its valuable
energy while at the same time reducing certain dangers
associated with its potential for nuclear weapons pro-
liferation. In the process of dismantling and declassify-
ing nuclear weapons, the US intends to convert much of
the Pu metal to oxide using a hydride±oxidation process
[1]. This process yields a PuO2ÿx powder that potentially
can be incorporated into a mixed oxide nuclear fuel, a
mixture of PuO2 and UO2, or perhaps one day in an
advanced non-fertile fuel. However, unlike reactor grade
Pu, weapons grade Pu contains minor additions of gal-
lium in order to stabilize the d-phase, making the alloy
easily machinable. Gallium is a known embrittling agent
and alloys rapidly with most metals. Consequently, to
assure proper cladding and fuel performance, Ga must
be largely removed from weapons grade plutonium be-
fore it can be processed and used. In order to avoid
aqueous processing of this material, which could pro-
duce considerable additional waste, we have proceeded
toward the development of a relatively simple thermal
process for removing gallium from PuO2ÿx, with the
objective of achieving parts per million levels. our pro-
posed removal process involves heating the oxide in an
Ar±H2 environment, probably at temperatures in excess
of 1000°C, producing as the primary gaseous product
Ga2O(g) from decomposition of the Ga2O3 present in
the mixture. As described below, the equilibrium partial
pressure of Ga2O(g) above Ga2O3 is relatively high in a
reducing atmosphere. Once evolved, the Ga2O(g) is
swept away from the PuO2ÿx by the gas stream and must
be collected and removed from the heat-treatment sys-
tem. In this paper, we brie¯y communicate some of the
important fundamentals of the thermodynamics and

kinetics of the processes of vaporization and deposition.
The primary focus of this paper is on the nature of the
deposition product, which is of importance for assessing
a means for gallium collection. The deposition products
are characterized in detail using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS).
2. Thermodynamics of gallium oxide vaporization in
hydrogen
Thermodynamic data for the Ga±O±H system were
collected [2±9] and free energies of formation were ®t,
using stepwise multiple linear regression, to the equation
DGf  a  bT  cT ÿ1  dT 2  eT 3  fT ln T;
1
where a±f are constants, and T is temperature in Kelvin.
Table 1 shows some of the data pertinent to this brief
analysis. Note that other gaseous products such as Ga,
GaH, GaO, Ga2O2, and Ga2O3 are not included in these
analyses because their equilibrium partial pressures are
comparatively low. The constants in Table 1 were used
to calculate temperature dependent expressions for the
vaporization behavior of gallium oxide from doped
PuO2 in Ar±6% H2. A temperature-dependent expres-
sion for the free energy of reaction can be determined
from the mass-action equation
Ga2O3s  2H2g ! Ga2Og  2H2Og:
2
From this equation the following relationship was de-
rived from which Ga2O(g) partial pressures can be cal-
culated:

Eq. (5) may be substituted for Eq. (3) by considering
how the partial pressure of oxygen is controlled by the
H2/H2O ratio according to buer reaction
H2g  1=2O2g ! H2Og:
6
It is apparent from Eqs. (5) and (6) that the higher
the H2/H2O ratio, the higher will be pGa2O (i.e., pGa2O is
inversely related to pO2). Thus, the vaporization of Ga2O
would be expected to be more rapid in dry versus moist
hydrogen. The equations described above can be used to
calculate the equilibrium partial pressures of Ga2O
above various PuO2±Ga2O3 solid solutions. In a typical
PuO2 feedstock, it is anticipated that aGa2O3 will be on
the order of 0.01 prior to any eorts to remove Ga.
However, at this date, the activity of Ga2O3 in a typical
PuO2 feedstock powder is not precisely known; there-
fore, for the purpose of illustration, we must assume
certain values of aGa2O3. Fig. 1 shows how the vapor-
ization behavior varies with environment as a function
of aGa2O3. The calculations were done assuming the gas
was a dry mixture of 1 atm of 6% H2 and a balance of
inert gas, such as Ar or He. This gas composition rep-
resents the experimental gases we are using in our Ga
removal studies. It is apparent from Fig. 1, that the
vaporization rate under the reducing eect of H2 is rel-
atively high, for example at 1000°C (1273 K) pGa2O varies
between 10ÿ4 and 10ÿ2 for aGa2O3 between 1 ´ 10ÿ6 and
1, respectively. Thus, in a dry hydrogen environment, at
elevated temperatures, Ga2O3 will vaporize relatively
rapidly according to Eq. (2).
Fig. 2 shows the in¯uence of temperature on the
calculated equilibrium composition when 1 mole of
Ga2O3 is reacted with 100 moles of Ar±6% H2. These
complex equilibria were calculated using the computer
program SOLGASMIX [10] and available thermody-
namic data [2±9]. The possible formation of the con-
densed phases Ga2O and Ga(OH)3 was ignored. Fig. 2
illustrates that at temperatures greater than 720°C,
Ga2O3 will react with H2 forming only Ga2O(g). Below
this temperature, Ga2O(g) will react with H2 forming
some Ga(l) (note the melting point of Ga is 30°C).

Further, it is predicted that some of the Ga2O(g) will
also back react with H2O(g) forming Ga2O3. Thus, we
anticipate that in Ar±6% H2, at elevated temperatures
(>720°C) Ga2O3 will vaporize to Ga2O(g). As this gas
travels in the gas stream to cooler regions of the furnace,
Ga2O(g) may back react with H2(g) and H2O(g) and
condense on the furnace walls forming Ga(l) and Ga2O3.
It should be emphasized that these calculations do not
preclude the possible condensation of Ga2O or Ga(OH)3
species.
3. Experimental procedures
In order to validate or disprove the deposition pro-
cess predicted from the aforementioned thermodynamic
calculations, Ga2O3 powder was placed in the hot zone
of a controlled atmosphere furnace. The Ga2O3 was
99.999% pure powder (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA) with
the major impurity being 4.0 ppm Sn. Ultra high purity
Ar±6% H2 was ¯owed through the furnace. The gas was
gettered using calcium sulfate and 650°C copper chips to
achieve H2O partial pressures well below 1 ppm. De-
position products were collected near the end of the
furnace on either fused SiO2 or Cu substrates, i.e., inert
or reactive substrates, respectively. The deposition
products were always a dark, powdery substance. In the
case of products deposited onto SiO2, the residue was
carefully removed and mounted as a coherent layer on
In foil for analysis. In the case of products deposited
onto Cu, the coated substrate was analyzed intact.
The samples were analyzed by XPS in a multitech-
nique surface analysis apparatus (Model 5600ci, Physi-
cal
Electronics,
Eden
Prairie,
MN).
Spectrometer
linearity and absolute energy positions were calibrated
to give the Au 4f7=2, Ag 3d5=2, and Cu 2p3=2 peak posi-
tions within 0.10 eV of 84.00, 368.30, and 932.65 eV
binding energy (BE) [11]. Most of the data were taken
using un®ltered Mg or Al radiation. One exception to
this was the sputter-pro®ling measurement on the coated
Cu substrate, which was done using a monochromatized
Al source. Excitation with the Al sources was preferred
as it eliminated the strong overlap between the C 1s and
Ga LMM transitions. The C 1s peak is important for
carbon-based energy referencing. For this reason only
data taken with the Al sources are reported herein. The
spectra were taken at a pass energy of 23.5 eV to insure
high quality peak shapes. During analyses the spec-
trometer aperture settings were set to allow examination
of less than one square millimeter of the sample. Sputter
pro®ling was done in an XPS mode using 4 keV argon
ions with a current density of 6 lA/cm2 and rastering
over a (4 ´ 4) mm2 area. The sputtering rate for these
parameters was measured at 1.5 nm per minute on a
reference SiO2 coating, a value that is taken as the ®gure
of merit for the present work.
The data obtained on the Ga residues were compared
with reference spectra acquired from a high-purity
Ga2O3 powder mounted on In foil. Using this infor-
mation in conjunction with data found in the literature
[12±14] made it possible to interpret the measurements
made on the residue. The chief diculty in analyzing the
residues was sample charging under the X-ray source.
This was especially true for the materials that had been
pressed onto the In foil. Because sample charging un-
couples the energy scale of the measured spectrum from
the Fermi level of the analyzer, proper interpretation of
these spectra requires an internal energy reference or the

use of energy dierences between appropriate spectral
features, the later being independent of the surface po-
tential. Both these methods were used in the data anal-
ysis.
In all cases, the C 1s BE was used as the internal
reference. It was assigned a value of 284.8 eV, which is a
generally accepted number for the bonding of adventi-
tious carbon species commonly adsorbed on a surface
during air exposure [15]. In comparing the peak posi-
tions for several samples, one must assume that the
carbon species are equivalent for each case. A better way
of dierentiating the Ga binding states on these mate-
rials is to measure the energy dierence between the Ga
3d photoelectron peak and the strongest Ga LMM
Auger peak produced by the X-ray radiation. Because of
the inequivalence in the electron emission process for
these two types of transitions, the dierence in the peak
energies, known as the Auger parameter [16], is a valid
indicator of the Ga binding state. As excited by a
magnesium X-ray source, the published Ga LMM ± Ga
3d peak energy dierences for metallic Ga and Ga2O3
are 167.0 and 170.7 eV, respectively [13]. When acquired
using an aluminium X-ray source, these values are
shifted to higher energies by 233±400.0 eV and 403.7 eV.
The peak position for the Ga 3d transition in Ga2O3 has
been reported at 20.5 [12] and 20.8 eV BE [13], while that
for metallic Ga is located 1.9±2.6 eV lower in BE. This
information, in combination with our own Ga2O3 ref-
erence spectra, allowed us to fully interpret the Ga states
found on the residue.
4. Experimental results
Four dierent deposit and powder samples were
pressed onto In foil for analysis. These included: (1) a
Ga2O3 powder standard, (2) a Ga2O3 powder that had
been heated to 1100°C in Ar-6% H2, (3) a black depo-
sition product, scraped from a silica substrate that
subsequently had seen hours of air exposure before
analysis, and (4) a black deposition product, scraped
from a silica substrate that had only seen 5 min of air
exposure during transfer to the surface apparatus.
Figs. 3 and 4 show the Ga 3d and Ga LMM peaks for
the above four samples. The kinetic energy values for
Fig. 4 were obtained by subtracting the BE from the
aluminium X-ray energy (1486.6 eV). As shown in
Fig. 4, the Auger emission for the single-state Ga2O3
reference material exhibits a doublet, whereas the Ga 3d
transition in Fig. 3 has a characteristic gaussian±lo-
rentzian shape. In the latter case, the low-level signal
intensity above 21.5 eV BE is due to overlap with the O
2s transition. The carbon-referenced peak positions for
the Ga 3d and the dominant Ga LMM component are
listed in Table 2, along with their energy dierences. The
Ga2O3 reference sample gives an energy dierence
(403.55 eV) that is 0.15 eV smaller than the value derived
from the published literature value [13]. The values from
the other samples are no more than 0.45 eV larger. This
is a strong indicator that the dominant bonding state is
Ga2O3 for all the materials. With this in mind and in
order to clarify the dierences in peak shapes for the
powders and deposits on SiO2, the spectra for these
materials have been plotted with the Ga 3d peak max-
ima aligned at 19.85 eV BE, the carbon-referenced value
for Ga2O3; consequently, the plotted information is
shifted slightly relative to the energy values in Table 2.
The vertical lines inscribed on the ®gures indicate the

treatment furnace).

approximate location of the peaks assigned to the oxide
and metallic Ga (or Ga0) species, consistent with the
literature values [12,13].
The Ga LMM spectrum from the deposit loaded with
minimum air exposure was simulated using a combina-
tion of reference peak shapes for Ga2O3, GaOx, and Ga0
binding states. The line shapes for each of these states
were taken from the Ga2O3 reference powder. The three
simulation peaks were scaled and their energy shifted to
get the best ®t to the data, as shown in Fig. 5. There was
a signi®cant disparity between the simulation and the
data when just two peaks representing Ga2O3 and Ga0
were used in the ®t. As indicated by the dierence (data
minus simulation) plot in Fig. 5, the three-peak simu-
lation did not recreate a continuously ¯at background in
the Ga LMM data. We believe that the three-peak
simulation properly re¯ects the Ga2O3 and Ga0 states,
but that the intermediate oxide state or states is less well
de®ned than the approximation used in the ®t. Never-
theless, the data give qualitative evidence for an inter-
mediate set of Ga bonding states. For the placement of
the Ga 3d data as in Fig. 5, the peak positions for the
stimulated Ga2O3, GaOx, and Ga0 states are 423.60,
421.90, and 417.10 eV BE, respectively.
It is possible to better understand the composition of
the Ga 3d peak by linking it with the Ga LMM simu-
lation. The aforementioned energy dierence for the
Ga2O3 reference from Table 1 (403.55 eV) was used to
de®ne the location of the Ga 3d counterpart. The Ga2O3
reference line shape for the Ga 3d transition was then
placed at this energy and scaled to give a credible con-
tribution to the Ga 3d data from the deposit, as shown
in Fig. 6. A credible contribution was deemed one that,
when subtracted from the data, produced a high-BE
edge on the dierence plot that was similar to that seen
Fig. 5. Simulation compared with the measured Ga LMM
spectrum from the deposit on SiO2 (minutes of air exposure
following removal from the heat treatment furnace). In addition
to the Ga2O3 and metallic Ga components used in the simula-
tion, a third contribution (GaOx) has been introduced that in-
dicates the existence of an intermediate Ga oxidation state (or
states). The dierence spectrum compares the data with the
simulation.

for the data and reference traces. From the dierence
plot in Fig. 6 one sees evidence for two states, an in-
termediate oxide (suboxide) and Ga metal (unoxidized).
These two states are located near 19.3 and 17.5 eV BE,
respectively. The placement and relative size of the
suboxide contribution is heavily dependent on the
Ga2O3 contribution to the Ga 3d peak, while the me-
tallic peak is less aected. The resultant Ga 3d ± Ga
LMM energy dierence for the metallic Ga is 399.60 eV,
which compares well with the published value of 400.00
eV [13]. It is not possible to de®nitively prove the precise
composition of the suboxide state or states, although its
Ga 3d intermediate energy position is consistent with
previous XPS measurements on condensed Ga2O [14].
For the rapidly transferred deposit the energy dif-
ference between the primary Ga2O3 and Ga0 contribu-
tions in the Ga LMM transition region is 6.5 eV. The
same two components with this relative separation are
also evident in the spectrum for the deposit with ex-
tended air exposure (see Fig. 4). In the latter case, the
metallic Ga contribution is noticeably smaller due to the
more advanced oxidation in air, which forms an outer-
most Ga2O3 layer. Lastly, the Ga2O3 powder that had
been heated to 1100°C in argon plus hydrogen only
showed a fully stoichiometric oxide con®guration (see
Fig. 4).
Comparable spectra were obtained from the deposi-
tion product on the Cu substrate after it had been ex-
posed to air for about 5 min, as seen in the Ga 3d and
Ga LMM data of Figs. 7 and 8. This deposited layer
was measured to be 30 nm thick by XPS sputter pro-
®ling, which revealed the Cu substrate after 20 min of
sputtering. The relative positions of the two end-state
components in the Ga LMM spectra are near the 6.5 eV
separation seen for the Ga2O3 and Ga0 states in the
scraped deposit data, described previously. By compar-
ison with the those data, there is clear evidence for
metallic Ga, whose contribution relative to the oxide
states increases with depth into the material. In view of
previous work [17], showing no sputter reduction of
Ga2O3 by ion bombardment, the Ga chemical state
composition should not be aected by the pro®ling
process. The data clearly show that air exposure rapidly
oxidizes any metallic Ga component in the topmost
layers of the deposit.
5. Concluding remarks
Thermodynamic calculations of the Ga±O±H system
indicate
that
during
high-temperature
exposure
of
Ga2O3 to H2, material will vaporize as predominantly
Ga2O(g). As the gas product is transported to cooler
regions of the furnace the Ga2O(g) will back react with
H2(g) and H2O(g) and will condense out as Ga(l) and
Ga2O3. XPS studies of the deposition product from such
a reducing environment generally con®rm these ther-
modynamic calculations.
The XPS data for the deposit scraped from the fur-
nace walls de®nitely show that the near-surface region is
not as fully oxidized when the air exposure is minimized.
Furthermore, the relative amount of metallic Ga for the
rapidly transferred deposit is larger than that recorded
for the as-received deposit on Cu. The larger metallic Ga
signal from the former deposit may be ascribed to
freshly exposed surfaces of Ga metal, which are pro-
duced by the scraping process. For the deposit on Cu the
topmost layers of the material are continuously exposed
to the reactive gas species in the furnace environment
prior to atmospheric exposure.

sputtering time. As the Ga2O3 enriched surface layer from air
exposure is removed, the metallic Ga contribution increases
while the oxide persists, indicating that the as-deposited mate-
rial in the furnace is a mixture of oxide and Ga metal.

The increasing amount of metallic Ga observed
nearer the Cu interface may represent dierences in the
thermodynamics of the redistribution in the presence of
the Cu oxide on the substrate. However, such an eect
may merely be the result of porosity in the deposited
layer, where the material deeper in the ®lm is more ef-
fectively shielded from the atmosphere, either that of the
furnace or during the transfer to the surface apparatus.
We can only speculate regarding whether the Ga sub-
oxide indicated by the spectra is more than just a graded
oxide layer formed by air exposure. However, it is pos-
sible that some of the suboxide is a directly deposited
species, in agreement with the Ga2O known to be pro-
duced from thermodynamic considerations.
