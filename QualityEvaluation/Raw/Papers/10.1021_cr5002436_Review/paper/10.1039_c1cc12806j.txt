Metal-free ordered mesoporous carbons were demonstrated to
be robust catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of propane to
propylene, in the absence of any auxiliary steam, exhibiting high
activity and selectivity, as well as long catalytic stability, in
comparison with nanostructured carbons.
Dehydrogenation of propane has attracted considerable atten-
tion due to the growing demand for propylene. The industrial
catalytic processes generally use chromia- or platinum-based
catalysts supported on alumina and promoted with alkali
metals.1,2 However, the major challenges associated with this
catalytic system are the coking and cracking which inﬂuence
the catalyst stability and propylene selectivity, respectively.
None of the current dehydrogenation processes are perfect and
ways of improving the process are always being sought.3–5
Developing new eﬃcient catalyst systems to improve catalytic
performance, especially allowing long-time production of
propylene with high selectivity at higher propane conversions,
is of great importance.
With their large surface area and uniform pore sizes, meso-
porous carbon materials oﬀer the possibility of creating reac-
tion sites and molecular conﬁnement that permit the selective
formation of reaction products in heterogeneous catalysis.
However, little eﬀort to date has been focused on the direct
dehydrogenation reaction over mesoporous carbon materials,
though nanocarbons have been found to be eﬃcient in the
oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene and butane.6–10
We report here the catalytic performance in the steam-free
dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over metal-free
ordered mesoporous carbon materials. The inﬂuence of the
carbon nature on the propane dehydrogenation performance
by investigating and comparing carbon materials of diﬀerent
structure was also studied. It has been revealed that these
ordered mesoporous carbons can eﬃciently catalyze the dehydro-
genation reaction, despite there being no metal deposited,
exhibiting higher catalytic activity and stability than the
conventional metal-supported systems.
Ordered mesoporous carbons OMC-1 and OMC-2 were
synthesized based on organic–organic self-assembly,11 and
CMK-3 was obtained through a hard-templating approach
using mesoporous silica SBA-15.12 Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
were multi-walled with the diameter range of 5–45 nm, obtained
as the reference mentioned.13 Well-ordered hexagonal meso-
structure was observed in transmission electron microscopic
images of the OMC-1 and CMK-3 carbons (ESI, Fig. S1).
OMC-2 also shows the periodic arranged pore structures,
with neighboring channels interconnected. Nitrogen sorption
analysis (ESI, Fig. S2) showed that CMK-3 has the highest
surface area (1331 m2 g1) with a large amount of micropores.
OMC-1 and OMC-2 have similar textural properties, but the
pore width of OMC-1 is a little larger than that of OMC-2.
CNTs possess a wide pore size distribution, while commercial
graphite carbon (GC) is nonporous.
The activity of the catalyst samples for dehydrogenation
of propane was tested in a ﬁxed-bed tubular reactor at atmo-
spheric pressure. The main by-products are methane, ethane
and ethene for all the tested carbons (ESI, Fig. S4), but much
more by-products are present for CMK-3. In parallel to the
increase of propane conversion and yield of propylene, the
selectivity to propylene decreased with elevating the reaction
temperature for all the tested carbons. As the catalytic activities
of diﬀerent carbon catalysts summarized in Table 1, the initial
activities (15 min in steam) at 873 K measured by the conversion
for OMC-1 and OMC-2 are 69.3% and 65.7% with propylene
yields of 43.1% and 46.4%, respectively, much greater than that
of CMK-3 carbon catalyst (propane conversion of 54.3%
with propylene yield of 15%). However, poor dehydrogenation
activity (only 6.5–9% of propane conversion) was observed when
CNTs and/or GC were used.
Fig. 1 shows the results of propane conversion and selectivity
to propylene as a function of time over ordered mesoporous
carbon catalysts. After a short induction period, each meso-
porous carbon stably catalyzes propylene formation during a
reaction lasting 100 h under the operating conditions. The
ﬁnal conversions are 44.5%, 39.3% and 49.8% for OMC-1,
OMC-2 and CMK-3, with the ﬁnal yields of 37.9%, 34.8%
and 32.9%, respectively. It is worthwhile to note that the
propylene selectivity of OMC-x remained almost unchanged
over 100 h. This may be related to the large void volume

of the composite available for the gas stream, avoiding local
transport limitations and hot spots.6 The stable propylene
yield higher than 38% over OMC-1 is comparable with that
of the catalysts based on the previously reported Pt/Sn-Ce
(39% during reaction of 50 h),14 but much higher than that of
the Pt/Sn based catalysts.3,4,15,16 Whereas, severe deactivation
of the nanostructured carbons was detected (ESI, Fig. S5).
After 7 h, the conversion of propane is as low as 6.7% over
CNTs, yielding 5.8% propylene. GC is much less active with
propane conversion of 4.0%, yielding 3.0% propylene after
only two hours on stream.
It is generally assumed that each type of surface oxygen
groups decompose to a deﬁned product at diﬀerent temperatures
through temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) methods
i.e., the CO2 peak derives from carboxylic acids at low tempera-
tures (T o700 K), and from lactones at higher temperatures
(700–900 K), and CO from carbonyls and hydroxyl groups
and ether-type oxygen at temperatures above 900 K.17–19
Figueiredo et al. found that decomposition temperatures were
approximately 820 K for anhydrides, 905 K for phenols and
1080 K for carbonyls/quinones.20 The TPD proﬁles of OMC-1
and OMC-2 exhibit one peak with a maximum at around 1070 K
(ESI, Fig. S6), which originates from carbonyls/quinones.
CMK-3 carbon shows a sharp peak at 470 K and two broad
peaks ranging from 500 to 1270 K, which may be attributed to
carboxylic acid, hydroxyl and anhydride.20 However, CNTs
exhibit an extremely small peak at 550 K, corresponding to
the carboxylic groups arising from HNO3 treatment during the
synthesis process.17 GC represents no obvious peak in the
tested temperature. Little functional groups presented in these
nanostructured carbon surfaces may cause them to show terrible
catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane.
Mesoporous carbons are much more active than other
carbon materials, including CNTs and GC. The reaction rate
as the amount of propylene produced per hour is depicted in
ESI, Fig. S7. OMC-1 displays a value of 118 mmol g1 h1,
which is comparable with OMC-2 of 127 mmol g1 h1, up to
5–7 times that of CNTs/GC, and 1.5 times that of CMK-3
(ESI, Table S1). The robust catalytic activity of OMC-x may
be related to their abundant surface oxygen groups. Fig. 2
shows the O 1s X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of mesoporous
carbons before reaction. Three prevailing oxygen species were
identiﬁed in the O (1s) spectra corresponding to unsaturated C
Q
O
components (O1, BE = 531.1 eV), saturated C–O components
(O2, BE = 532.8 eV) and adsorbed water (O3, BE = 535.1 eV).21
The total surface oxygen atomic concentrations in OMC-1,
OMC-2 and CMK-3 were estimated from XPS to be 6.7%,
7.1% and 3.8% respectively, and the corresponding O1 concen-
trations are 1.2%, 1.4% and 0.5% respectively. The total
content of oxygen atoms and O1 in OMC-x is much larger
than that of CMK-3. This result is in good concordance with
the reaction rate. The sample with the highest carbonyl concen-
tration has the highest reaction rate, corresponding to the fact
that carbonyl groups are the active sites in the dehydrogenation
reaction.22
The textural properties of the used carbons were also investi-
gated by nitrogen sorption analysis (ESI, Fig. S2). Nitrogen
isotherms of the used CMK-3 and OMC-x after reaction still
exhibit typical IV curves, suggesting the retention of well-
deﬁned mesopores with cylindrical shape. However, the BET
surface area seriously decreased (Table 1, data in parentheses),
e.g. the BET surface area of the CMK-3 carbon decreased

from 1331 to 687 m2 g1 after use as catalyst. Meanwhile, it is
worthwhile to note that the micropores nearly disappeared for
all the mesoporous carbon catalysts after prolonged reaction,
which may be the result of the formation of coke during the
reaction.23 Correspondingly, a slight deactivation process was
observed in all mesoporous carbon catalysts. However, the
high stability shown in Table 1 indicates that the loss of the
surface area at the very beginning of the reaction does not
have a strong inﬂuence on the catalytic performance of the
carbon catalysts.
Previous reports showed that nanostructured carbon material,
i.e. CNTs, GC, carbon nanoﬁbers, carbon nanoﬁlaments, and
carbon onions,6–10 provided high activity in the ODH reac-
tions of ethylbenzene and butane. It has been accepted that the
existence of oxygen is indispensable for the ODH reaction,9
since active sites consisting of diketone- and/or ketone-
like groups are initially generated during the synthesis and
maintained in their oxidation states by contact with the
reactant O2.7–9,23 In the present work, the dehydrogenation
of propane to propylene was performed in the absence of
oxygen. However, both CNTs and GC exhibit terrible catalytic
performance, which is in accordance with the results of butane
dehydrogenation demonstrated by Zhang et al.7 In comparison,
ordered mesoporous carbons show much higher catalytic
activity under the same reaction conditions. The XPS and
TPD results conﬁrm that the presence of carbonyl/quinone
groups is essential for a good catalytic activity. Unsaturated
ketone/diketone-type carbonyl groups and quinone groups have
substantial electron density at the oxygen atom, which can
serve as Lewis base to activate saturated hydrocarbons.6–10 In
the dehydrogenation of propane, ketonic C
Q
O activates
propane as the electron donor. Propylene is produced and
hydroxyl groups (C–OH) remain as intermediates. The reac-
tion cycle is closed by the thermal decomposition of C–OH to
C
Q
O and molecular hydrogen, which is thermodynamically
favorable at high temperatures. Meanwhile, deactivation of
the C
Q
O active site can be further induced by hydrogen
passivation during the prolonged reaction period.22
The ordered mesoporous carbons showed outstanding
catalytic performance, which can also be related to their unique
structure of large porosity that is advantageous for mass
transport and good thermal stability.23 A recent adsorption
equilibrium investigation has demonstrated that the mass
transfer of propylene in the narrow pore-sized silica gel was
mainly controlled by Knudsen diﬀusion24 which is calculated
by Dk = 9700 rp (T/M)1/2, wherein Dk is the Knudsen
diﬀusivity for propylene diﬀusion, rp is the pore width and
M is the molecular weight of the adsorbate. The mesoporous
carbon catalyst OMC-1 with the largest pore diameter would
have the largest Dk value for propylene diﬀusion, thus favorable
for discharging of the produced propylene outside the pore,
consequently depressing the deep rupture and improving the
propylene selectivity. The unique interconnection channels
of
OMC-2 are also beneﬁcial in enhancing selectivity to
propylene by improving internal molecular transportation
during the dehydrogenation process. The abundance of micro-
pores in CMK-3 would hinder the produced propylene coming
out of the pores and bring the subsequent deep cracking,
decreasing the propylene selectivity.
In summary, ordered mesoporous carbons have been
applied as a new catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of
propane to propylene under steam-free conditions, exhibiting
high activity and selectivity, as well as good stability. The
presence of surface carbonyl groups is responsible for the
dehydrogenation activity. The large and well-ordered porosity
of mesoporous carbon catalysts should also be beneﬁcial for
mass transport in catalytic reaction, exhibiting long time
stability. The stable propylene yield higher than 38%, together
with the steady propylene selectivity of approximately 88%
during reaction of 100 h reported here, is a promising indication
for industrial applications, taking into account the absence of
auxiliary steam and the subsequent energy savings. Our ﬁndings
provide a new perspective for the application of ordered
mesoporous carbon materials.
