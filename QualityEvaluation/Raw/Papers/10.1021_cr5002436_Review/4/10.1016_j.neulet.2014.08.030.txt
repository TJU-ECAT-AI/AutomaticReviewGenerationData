Recent
 studies
 showed
 an  association
 between
 a functional
 polymorphism
 of  BDNF
 gene  (Val66Met)
and
 the  susceptibility
 to  methamphetamine
 addiction.
 We  hypothesized
 that  this  polymorphism
 was
associated
 with
 methamphetamine
 abuse
 and  impulsivity
 in  methamphetamine-abuse
 patients.
 The
polymorphism
 was  genotyped
 in  200  methamphetamine-abuse
 patients
 and  219  healthy
 controls.
 The
association
 of  the  Val66Met
 polymorphism
 of  the  BDNF  gene
 and impulsivity
 in  138  methamphetamine
abusers
 were  assessed
 using
 Barratt  Impulsivity
 Scale-11(BIS-11)
 Chinese
 version.
 The  relationship
between
 the  polymorphism
 and  age  of  onset
 of
 methamphetamine
 abuse  was  also  examined.
 Our  results
showed
 no  signiﬁcant
 differences
 in  genotype
 and
 allele  distributions
 between
 the  methamphetamine
abusers
 and  controls.
 Within
 the  methamphetamine-abuse
 group,
 subjects
 carried
 the  Met  allele  had
signiﬁcantly
 higher  attentional
 impulsivity
 scores
 of
 BIS  compared
 to those
 with  the  Val/Val
 geno-
type.
 The  Met  allele  was  also  associated
 with  earlier
 age  onset
 of  methamphetamine
 use.  Our  ﬁndings
suggest
 that  the  BDNF  Val66Met
 gene  polymorphism
 may
 inﬂuence
 attentional
 impulsivity
 in metham-
phetamine
 abusers.
 Moreover,
 the  BDNF  Val66Met
 gene
 polymorphism
 may  contribute
 to  onset
 age  of

 Introduction
Substance
 abuse
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 common
 mental
 illnesses,
leading
 to
 serious
 behavior,
 health,
 and
 psychiatric
 consequences.
Although
 the
 mechanism
 of
 substance
 abuse
 is
 not
 yet
 clear,
 famil-
ial
 study
 shows
 that
 genes
 play
 a
 role
 in
 the
 predisposition
 to
substance
 abuse
 [19],
 such
 as
 opioid
 receptor
 gene,
 serotonin
receptor
 gene,
 dopamine
 receptor
 gene,
 and
 catecholamine
 oxygen
methyl
 transferase
 gene
 [5].
Brain-derived
 neurotrophic
 factor
 (BDNF)
 belongs
 to
 the
 family
of
 neurotrophic
 factors,
 it
 is
 widely
 expressed
 in
 the
 adult
 mam-
malian
 brain,
 and
 plays
 several
 important
 roles
 such
 as
 promotion
of
 development,
 differentiation,
 and
 survival
 of
 serotonin
 neurons,
dopaminergic
 neurons
 and
 other
 neurons
 in
 the
 central
 ner-
vous
 system
 [27].
 Indeed,
 previous
 studies
 indicated
 that
 a
 single
nucleotide
 polymorphism
 (SNP)
 (rs6265),
 which
 is
 located
 in
 the
proBDNF
 protein
 at
 codon
 66(chromosomal
 location:
 27679916,
gene
 position:
 exon
 11),
 changes
 an
 amino
 acid
 from
 valine
 (Val)
to
 methionine
 (Met)
 substitution
 (Val66Met),
 is
 involved
 in
 drug
addiction.
 A
 multiple
 ethnicity
 study
 showed
 that
 the
 frequency
 of
the
 66Val
 allele
 in
 Chinese
 methamphetamine-dependent
 subjects
was
 higher
 than
 control
 group,
 suggesting
 that
 the
 66Val
 carriers
are
 more
 susceptible
 to
 methamphetamine
 dependence
 [23].
 This
result
 is
 in
 accordance
 with
 one
 study
 from
 Taiwan
 [8].
 Heinzerling
et
 al.
 found
 a
 signiﬁcant
 association
 between
 BDNF
 Val66Met
 geno-
type
 and
 treatment
 outcomes
 in
 methamphetamine
 dependents
with
 worse
 outcomes
 among
 white
 Met
 carriers
 [12].
 They
 also
reported
 a
 signiﬁcant
 interaction
 between
 sex
 and
 BDNF
 Val66Met,
with
 the
 high
 frequency
 of
 methamphetamine
 use
 among
 females
with
 Val/Val
 genotype
 [13].
 However,
 an
 investigation
 from
 Japan
found
 no
 signiﬁcant
 differences
 in
 the
 frequency
 of
 the
 Val66Met
SNP
 between
 methamphetamine
 abusers
 and
 controls.
 Taken
together,
 these
 ﬁndings
 suggest
 that
 BDNF
 Val66Met
 gene
 poly-
morphism
 may
 play
 a
 role
 in
 inﬂuencing
 methamphetamine
 abuse.
Impulsivity,
 as
 a
 kind
 of
 personality
 traits,
 characterized
 by
behavior
 disinhibition,
 is
 deﬁned
 as
 suddenly
 disorderly
 to
 sat-
isfy
 a
 certain
 desire
 and
 action:
 for
 example,
 acting
 on
 the
 spur
 of
the
 moment,
 regardless
 of
 the
 consequences,
 or
 making
 statements
before
 thinking
 [17].
 Impulsivity
 is
 associated
 with
 many
 psychi-
atric
 disorders,
 such
 as
 bipolar
 disorder,
 personality
 disorder,
 and
substance
 use
 disorders.
 Recent
 research
 showed
 that
 impulsivity
was
 a
 strong
 predictor
 for
 substance
 dependence,
 such
 as
 alcohol,
nicotine,
 cocaine
 and
 methamphetamine
 dependence
 [1,16,25].
 It
may
 enhance
 the
 subject’s
 vulnerability
 for
 drug
 addiction
 and
relapse
 [17].
 Impulsivity
 has
 been
 shown
 to
 be
 signiﬁcantly
 greater
in
 methamphetamine-dependent
 patients
 compared
 to
 normal
controls
 by
 using
 the
 BIS-11
 [18].
The
 relationship
 between
 BDNF
 Val66Met
 gene
 polymorphism
and
 impulsivity
 was
 reported
 in
 many
 studies
 on
 impulsive
 behav-
ior.
 Several
 studies
 revealed
 correlation
 between
 Val66Met
 and
Attention
 Deﬁcit
 Hyperactivity
 Disorder,
 a
 disorder
 character-
ized
 by
 higher
 level
 of
 hyperactivity
 and
 impulsivity
 [2].
 Another
study
 reported
 the
 BDNF
 Met
 allele
 may
 confer
 a
 ‘preferred
drug-invested’
 phenotype
 in
 heroin-dependent
 patients
 [11].
 Sero-
tonergic
 and
 dopaminergic
 mechanisms
 were
 implicated
 in
 the
form
 of
 impulsivity.
 The
 Val66Met
 gene
 polymorphism
 was
 found
not
 associated
 with
 impulsivity
 in
 alcohol-dependent
 patients
[26].
 The
 association
 between
 Val66Met
 gene
 polymorphism
 and
impulsivity
 in
 methamphetamine
 users
 however
 has
 not
 been
reported.
Based
 on
 the
 fact
 that
 higher
 impulsivity
 observed
 among
methamphetamine
 abusers,
 possible
 relationship
 exists
 between
BDNF
 and
 impulsivity,
 we
 hypothesize
 that
 BDNF
 Val66Met
gene
 polymorphism
 may
 play
 a
 role
 in
 the
 impulsivity
 of
methamphetamine-abuse
 patients.
 The
 purposes
 of
 this
 study
 were
to
 determine
 (1)
 differences
 in
 genotype
 and
 allele
 distributions
 of
BDNF
 Val66Met
 gene
 polymorphism
 between
 methamphetamine
abusers
 and
 healthy
 controls,
 (2)
 the
 relationship
 between
 BDNF
Val66Met
 gene
 polymorphism
 distribution
 and
 age
 of
 onset
of
 methamphetamine
 use
 and
 (3)
 associations
 between
 BDNF
Val66Met
 gene
 polymorphism
 distribution
 and
 impulsivity
 using
Barratt
 Impulsivity
 Scale-11(BIS-11)
 Chinese
 version
 in
 metham-
phetamine
 abusers.

 Materials
 and
 methods
2.1.
 Subjects
A
 total
 of
 200
 methamphetamine
 abusers
 were
 enrolled
 in
 this
study.
 All
 the
 participants
 were
 inpatients
 at
 the
 Wenzhou
 Sanyang
drug
 rehabilitation
 center,
 Zhejiang
 Province,
 with
 a
 conﬁrmed
substance
 abuse
 diagnosis
 according
 to
 the
 Diagnostic
 and
 Statis-
tical
 Manual
 of
 Mental
 Disorders,
 Fourth
 Edition
 (DSM-IV)
 criteria,
as
 interpreted
 by
 a
 psychiatrist
 at
 interview.
 The
 exclusion
 criteria
included:
 age
 under
 18
 years;
 current
 Axis
 I
 psychiatric
 disorders
 or
substances
 use
 other
 than
 methamphetamine;
 could
 not
 cooperate
with
 histories
 of
 other
 diseases.
 The
 219
 controls
 were
 healthy
 vol-
unteers
 recruited
 from
 the
 physical
 examination
 center
 at
 The
 First
Afﬁliated
 Hospital
 of
 Wenzhou
 Medical
 University.
 All
 controls
 had
no
 histories
 for
 substance
 abuse
 and
 psychiatric
 illnesses.
 Both
 the
patients
 and
 controls
 are
 Han
 Chinese.
All
 the
 subjects
 were
 willing
 to
 participate
 in
 this
 study,
 and
 gave
informed
 consent
 for
 the
 use
 of
 their
 DNA
 samples.
 The
 study
 was
approved
 by
 the
 Institutional
 Review
 Board
 and
 the
 Ethics
 Commit-
tee
 of
 The
 First
 Afﬁliated
 Hospital
 of
 Wenzhou
 Medical
 University.
2.2.
 Impulsivity
Impulsivity
 was
 assessed
 using
 the
 BIS-11
 [20].
 The
 BIS-11
 con-
sists
 of
 30
 four-point
 Likert
 scale
 (1
 =
 rarely/never,
 2
 =
 occasionally,
3
 =
 often,
 4
 =
 almost
 always/always)
 self-reported
 items.
 The
 BIS-
11
 includes
 three-domain
 impulsivities:
 attentional
 impulsiveness,
motor
 impulsiveness,
 and
 non-planning
 impulsiveness.
 Eleven
 of
the
 30
 items
 are
 reverse-scored
 to
 avoid
 a
 response
 bias.
 Our
 study
used
 the
 26-item
 Chinese
 version
 of
 the
 BIS-11,
 which
 was
 trans-
lated
 from
 the
 original
 English
 version.
 According
 to
 the
 previous
studies
 in
 Chinese
 adolescents
 [28]
 and
 opioid-dependent
 subjects
in
 Taiwan
 [6],
 the
 Chinese
 version
 of
 the
 BIS-11
 demonstrated
 high
overall
 internal
 consistency
 and
 is
 applicable
 for
 Chinese
 people.
The
 participants
 were
 asked
 to
 ﬁnish
 the
 BIS-11
 during
 the
 ﬁrst
week
 of
 interviewing.
 Only
 138
 methamphetamine
 abusers
 ﬁn-
ished
 it,
 the
 other
 62
 patients
 could
 not
 persist
 ﬁnishing
 it
 or
 were
not
 willing
 to
 join
 it,
 so
 we  could
 not
 get
 these
 data.
 As
 the
 BIS
were
 used
 for
 substance-dependent
 subjects,
 it
 is
 not
 appropriate
for
 controls
 or
 healthy
 volunteers,
 we
 did
 not
 test
 the
 impulsivity
in
 controls.
2.3.
 Genotyping
About
 5
 mm
 of
 peripheral
 blood
 were
 collected
 in
 tubes
coated
 with
 EDTA.
 Genomic
 DNA
 was
 extracted
 from
 periph-
eral
 blood
 mononuclear
 cells
 using
 DNAzol
 reagent
 in
 accordance
with
 the
 manufacturer’s
 instructions
 (Invitrogen;
 Carlsbad,
 CA,
USA).
 SNP
 genotyping
 was
 performed
 using
 the
 MassArray
 plat-
form
 (Sequenom;
 San
 Diego,
 CA),
 which
 utilizes
 chip-based
matrix-assisted
 laser
 desorption
 ionization–time-of-ﬂight
 mass
spectrometry
 technology.
 Polymerase
 chain
 reaction
 (PCR)
 and
iPlex
 extension
 reactions
 were
 designed
 using
 MassArray
 Assay
Design
 3.1
 in
 multiplex
 format.
 Genotyping
 was
 then
 performed
according
 to
 the
 manufacturer’s
 standard
 protocols.
 MassArray
Typer
 3.4
 was
 used
 to
 read
 the
 extended
 mass
 and
 assign
 geno-
type
 calls.

 Statistical
 analysis
Deviations
 from
 Hardy–Weinberg
 equilibrium
 (HWE)
 were
assessed
 using
 the
 HWSIM
 program.
 Chi
 Square
 (2×)  tests
 were
used
 to
 compare
 the
 rs6265
 allelic
 and
 genotypic
 frequencies
between
 methamphetamine
 abusers
 and
 healthy
 controls.
 Group
differences
 were
 compared
 using
 Student’s
 t-tests
 or
 one-way
analysis
 of
 variance
 (ANOVA)
 for
 continuous
 variables
 and
 2×
 for
categorical
 variables.
 Post
 hoc
 comparisons
 between
 subgroups
were
 made
 using
 the
 Fisher’s
 least
 signiﬁcant
 difference
 (LSD)
 pro-
cedure.
Genotypic
 differences
 in
 BIS
 scores
 were
 compared
 using
 one-
way
 analysis
 of
 variance
 (ANOVA)
 ﬁrstly.
 After
 that,
 analyses
 of
covariance
 (ANCOVA)
 was
 constructed
 with
 the
 rs6265
 genotype
as
 the
 independent
 variable,
 the
 total
 impulsivity
 score
 and
 3
 index
scores
 as
 dependent
 variables,
 with
 sex,
 age,
 education,
 age
 of
onset,
 and
 total
 duration
 of
 methamphetamine
 use
 as
 the
 covari-
ates.
The
 power
 of
 the
 sample
 was
 calculated
 with
 Quanto
 software
with
 known
 risk
 allele
 frequencies,
 a
 methamphetamine
 abuse
population
 prevalence
 of
 1%,
 and
 examining
 log
 additive,
 recessive
and
 dominant
 models.
 The
 signiﬁcance
 level
 was
 set
 at
 p-value
 of
0.05.
 To
 correct
 for
 multiple
 comparisons,
 a
 Bonferroni
 correction
was
 applied
 to
 ANCOVA,
 setting
 the
 signiﬁcance
 level
 to
 p
 <

ﬁnished
 the
 BIS-11.
 As
 shown
 in
 Table
 2,
 ANOVA
 showed
 that
there
 was
 a
 signiﬁcant
 genotype
 effect
 of
 the
 rs6265
 polymorphism
on
 the
 attentional
 impulsivity
 score
 (F
 =
 3.333,
 p
 =
 0.039).
 This
 dif-
ference
 in
 performance
 between
 Val/Val
 and
 Met/Met
 genotypes
remained
 signiﬁcant
 in
 methamphetamine
 abusers
 (p
 =
 0.012).
After
 controlling
 for
 the
 sex,
 age,
 education,
 age
 of
 onset,
 and
 total
duration
 of
 methamphetamine
 use,
 this
 effect
 existed
 but
 weak
(F
 =
 4.405,
 p
 =
 0.014).
 There
 were
 no
 signiﬁcant
 genotype
 effects
for
 motor
 impulsivity
 scores,
 non-planning
 impulsivity
 scores
 and
total
 scores
 in
 methamphetamine
 abusers.
 There
 was
 no
 gender
 X
BDNF
 Val66Met
 interactions
 on
 impulsivity
 scores.
The
 effect
 of
 BDNF
 gene
 polymorphism
 on
 the
 age
 of
 onset
 of
methamphetamine
 abuse
 was
 also
 analyzed
 (Table
 3).
 Five
 data
were
 missing.
 The
 ages
 of
 onset
 were
 signiﬁcantly
 different
 among
the
 three
 genotypic
 groups
 (F
 =
 3.82,
 p
 =
 0.024),
 and
 post
 hoc
 LSD
testing
 showed
 that
 met66met
 carriers
 and
 val66met
 carriers
 had
earlier
 onset
 of
 methamphetamine
 abuse
 than
 val66val
 carriers
 did
(p
 =
 0.01
 and
 p
 =
 0.04,
 respectively).

 Discussion
To
 our
 knowledge,
 this
 is
 the
 ﬁrst
 study
 to
 investigate
the
 relationship
 between
 BDNF
 rs6265
 gene
 polymorphism
 and
impulsivity
 in
 methamphetamine
 abusers.
 We  had
 three
 main
ﬁndings.
 (1)
 We  found
 no
 signiﬁcant
 association
 between
 metham-
phetamine
 abuse
 and
 the
 BDNF
 Val66Met
 gene
 polymorphism.
 (2)
We
 found
 signiﬁcantly
 lower
 BIS
 attentional
 impulsivity
 score
 in
Val/Val
 carriers
 of
 Val66Met.
 (3)
 We  found
 a
 signiﬁcant
 relation-
ship
 between
 BDNF
 gene
 Val66Met
 polymorphism
 and
 onset
 age
of
 methamphetamine
 use.
In
 this
 study,
 the
 patients
 were
 younger
 than
 the
 controls,
 and
had
 fewer
 years
 of
 education
 and
 lower
 BMIs
 than
 healthy
 controls.
The
 difference
 may
 reﬂect
 the
 effects
 of
 some
 factors
 inﬂuencing
substance
 abuse,
 such
 as
 socioeconomic
 status,
 access
 to
 drugs,
peer’s
 use,
 and
 family
 status.
 As
 a
 result
 of
 the
 limitation
 in
 col-
lecting
 controls,
 we
 could
 not
 get
 exact
 match
 data,
 which
 needs
 to
be
 improved
 in
 future
 studies.
This
 study
 identiﬁed
 that
 the
 BDNF
 Val66Met
 gene
 polymor-
phism
 may
 not
 contribute
 to
 susceptibility
 to
 methamphetamine
abuse.
 Our
 ﬁndings
 are
 in
 line
 with
 a
 Japanese
 study,
 which
found
 no
 association
 between
 frequency
 of
 the
 genotype
 or
allele
 of
 rs6265
 and
 methamphetamine
 abuse
 [14].
 However,
 our
ﬁndings
 are
 not
 consistent
 with
 studies
 from
 Taiwan
 [8]
 and
Malaysia
 [23].
 The
 heterogeneous
 differences
 in
 the
 allelic
 fre-
quencies
 of
 the
 BDNF
 Val66Met
 polymorphism
 may
 explain
 the
different
 ﬁndings
 in
 these
 studies.
 The
 66Met
 allelic
 frequen-
cies
 are
 quite
 different
 in
 different
 populations
 –
 38.9%,
 53.3%,
and
 56.7%
 in
 Japanese,
 Taiwanese-Chinese,
 and
 Chinese-Malaysian
normal
 control
 subjects,
 respectively.
 In
 our
 study,
 the
 66Met
allelic
 frequency
 was
 50.2%,
 which
 was
 lower
 than
 the
 allelic
frequency
 in
 the
 two
 previous
 Chinese
 populations.
 Other
 genes
inﬂuence
 on
 drug
 abuse
 should
 also
 be
 taken
 into
 considera-
tion.
In
 our
 study,
 the
 Met/Met
 and
 Val/Met
 carriers
 of
 Val66Met
had
 an
 earlier
 onset
 of
 methamphetamine
 use
 compared
 to
 Val/Val
carriers.
 To
 our
 knowledge,
 this
 is
 the
 ﬁrst
 report
 showing
 an
 associ-
ation
 between
 the
 BDNF
 gene
 and
 age
 onset
 of
 methamphetamine
use.
 There
 are
 several
 possible
 mechanisms
 to
 explain.
 This
 poly-
morphism,
 which
 is
 located
 in
 the
 5′pro-BDNF
 sequence,
 encodes
the
 precursor
 peptide
 (pro-BDNF)
 to
 form
 the
 mature
 protein
 [22].
It
 is
 involved
 in
 transport
 and
 process
 of
 precursor
 peptide
 in
 the
cell,
 thus
 could
 adjust
 the
 mature
 protein
 secretion
 [10].
 This
 Met
variant
 could
 slow
 down
 packaging
 transport
 of
 BDNF,
 reduce
 BDNF
secretion,
 thus
 affect
 the
 memory
 function
 of
 the
 hippocampus
[7].
 These
 research
 results
 show
 that
 regulation
 of
 BDNF
 secretion
and
 protein
 production
 is
 affected
 by
 Val66Met
 gene
 polymor-
phism.
 Therefore,
 the
 Val66Met
 gene
 polymorphism
 has
 changed
the
 BDNF
 gene
 product,
 which
 in
 turn
 could
 affect
 central
 dopamine
signaling
 pathways
 and
 alter
 the
 behavioral
 effects
 of
 metham-
phetamine.
Pharmacobehavioral
 studies
 have
 implicated
 that
 impulsivity
is
 associated
 with
 many
 neurotransmitters
 and
 genes
 affect-
ing
 these
 neurotransmitters.
 Dopamine-
 and
 serotonin-releasing
neurons
 play
 a
 dominant
 role
 in
 train
 regions
 that
 regulate
impulse
 control.
 In
 neuropharmacological,
 gene
 knockout,
 gene
related
 studies
 the
 monoamine
 neurotransmitters
 changes
 have
been
 demonstrated
 to
 be
 involved
 in
 the
 impulsivity
 mecha-
nism
 [4].
 Serotonin
 is
 thought
 to
 be
 associated
 with
 impulsivity
relationship
 greatly,
 it
 has
 been
 conﬁrmed
 in
 the
 study
 of
impulsive
 attack
 and
 suicide,
 both
 in
 human
 and
 animal
 exper-
iments
 [9].
 Dopamine
 regulates
 cognitive
 function,
 attention
and
 rewarding
 responses,
 both
 are
 components
 of
 impulsi-
vity.
BDNF
 could
 promote
 the
 survival
 and
 differentiation
 of
dopaminergic
 neurons
 and
 serotonin
 neurons
 by
 interacting
 with
TrkB
 receptor
 tyrosine
 kinase.
 Animal
 experiment
 research
 indi-
cates
 that
 mice
 lacking
 activity-driven
 BDNF
 expression
 showed
impulsivity
 suppression
 damage.
 Monoamine
 systems
 (serotonin,
dopamine,
 and
 noradrenaline)
 are
 suggested
 to
 be
 associated
with
 this
 process
 [21].
 Previous
 studies
 have
 also
 shown
 that
BDNF
 Val66Met
 gene
 regulated
 BDNF
 intracellular
 trafﬁcking
 and
secretion
 in
 cultured
 hippocampal
 neurons
 (mostly
 dopamine
and
 serotonin
 neurons)
 transfected
 with
 the
 met
 allele
 [10].
For
 example,
 Injecting
 BDNF
 to
 rat
 midbrain
 could
 enhance
 the
rewarding
 effects
 of
 cocaine,
 and
 this
 kind
 of
 cocaine
 condi-
tioned
 place
 preference
 in
 the
 BDNF
 gene
 knockout
 animal
 will
weaken
 [24].
 In
 addition,
 the
 relationship
 between
 val66met
 and
hippocampal
 abnormalities
 has
 been
 reported
 in
 the
 study
 of
human
 subjects.
 The
 Val
 allele
 of
 the
 BDNF
 Val66Met
 polymor-
phism
 could
 induce
 higher
 BDNF
 secretion
 than
 the
 met
 allele
after
 using
 neuronal
 stimulation
 [24].
 Therefore,
 the
 Val
 allele
of
 Val66Met
 is
 a
 risk
 factor
 for
 impulsivity
 by
 mediating
 serum
BDNF
 through
 the
 dopamine-
 and
 serotonin-releasing
 neuron
 sys-
tem.
In
 this
 study,
 we
 found
 a
 signiﬁcant
 association
 between
Val66Met
 and
 attentional
 impulsiveness
 but
 not
 motor
 impulsive-
ness,
 nor
 non-planning
 impulsiveness
 or
 total
 score
 of
 the
 BIS-11.
Our
 results
 indicated
 a
 close
 relationship
 between
 Val66Met
 poly-
morphism
 and
 attentional
 impulsiveness,
 an
 impulse
 generated
by
 primitive
 and
 simple
 mental
 process.
 However,
 there
 was
no
 signiﬁcant
 association
 between
 rs6265
 and
 motor
 impulsive-
ness,
 non-planning
 impulsiveness
 and
 total
 impulsiveness,
 which
require
 more
 advanced
 and
 complex
 mental
 processes.
 The
 possi-
ble
 mechanism
 about
 the
 relationship
 is
 unknown,
 further
 studies
are
 needed.
This
 study
 has
 some
 limitations.
 First,
 the
 different
 allelic
 fre-
quency
 of
 the
 BDNF
 polymorphism
 could
 lead
 to
 inconsistent
results
 in
 different
 populations.
 Second,
 limited
 resources
 allowed
us
 to
 test
 only
 one
 polymorphism
 of
 all
 the
 SNPs
 in
 the
 BDNF
gene.
 Other
 SNPs
 that
 inﬂuence
 BDNF
 activity
 should
 be
 genotyped
in
 our
 future
 study.
 For
 example,
 the
 rs13306221
 and
 rs2030324
polymorphisms
 [3,15],
 which
 are
 considered
 to
 be
 associated
 with
substance
 dependence/abuse
 among
 various
 populations,
 will
 be
included.
 Third,
 although
 the
 BIS-11
 is
 becoming
 a
 widely
 used
screening
 tool
 in
 neuropsychological
 assessments,
 it
 has
 been
 used
in
 substance-dependent
 subjects
 only,
 it
 has
 been
 said
 inappro-
priate
 to
 be
 used
 in
 controls
 or
 healthy
 volunteers,
 we
 therefore
was
 not
 able
 to
 test
 the
 impulsivity
 in
 controls.
 Fourth,
 it
 is
 dif-
ﬁcult
 to
 evaluate
 all
 of
 the
 impulsivities
 that
 may
 be
 involved
 in
a
 person,
 such
 as
 functional
 and
 dysfunctional
 impulsivity.
 Fifth,
the
 other
 tools
 for
 assessing
 impulsivity,
 such
 as
 the
 Aggression
Questionnaire
 (Buss
 and
 Perry,
 1992),
 Dickman
 Impulsivity
 Inven-
tory
 (DII;
 Dickman,
 1990)
 were
 not
 available
 at
 the
 time
 of
 our
study.
In
 summary,
 our
 study
 found
 that
 the
 BDNF
 Val66Met
 gene
polymorphism
 may
 play
 an
 important
 role
 in
 impulsivity
 in
methamphetamine
 abusers.
 Signiﬁcant
 differences
 in
 attentional
impulsivity
 scores
 were
 observed
 between
 methamphetamine
abusers
 and
 controls
 but
 not
 in
 motor
 impulsivity
 score,
 non-
planning
 impulsivity
 score
 and
 total
 score.
 Moreover,
 this
 study
provided
 evidence
 to
 support
 the
 association
 between
 the
 BDNF
Val66Met
 gene
 polymorphism
 and
 age
 of
 onset
 in
 metham-
phetamine
 abusers,
 which
 suggested
 a
 speciﬁc
 role
 of
 the
 BNDF
gene
 in
 some
 aspects
 of
 substance
 addiction.
 However,
 our
 results
still
 require
 replication
 in
 future
 studies.
