Abstract 
The dehydrogenation 
of isobutane to isobutene was conducted in a comparatively low-temperature 
range (from 623 to 723 K) 
using a hydrogen-permeable 
membrane reactor. An Al,O,-supported 
platinum catalyst exhibited high activity compared with a 
commercial CrzO,-A1z03 catalyst in a conventional flow reactor. In the membrane reactor, however, the platinum catalyst gave a 
lower yield of isobutene than the Crz03-AlzO, catalyst, although the isobutene yields on both of these catalysts were high compared 
with thermodynamic 
equilibrium values attained in a conventional reactor. The platinum catalyst deteriorated more rapidly in the 
membrane reactor, due to deposition of carbonaceous material. On the other hand, undesirable side reactions such as hydroisomer- 
ization and hydrogenolysis were suppressed in the membrane reactor due to the removal of hydrogen produced from the reaction 
side, leading to high selectivity for isobutene. The yield of isobutene in the membrane reactor increased by the addition of tin to 
Pt/AlZ03, due to the suppression of coke formation.
