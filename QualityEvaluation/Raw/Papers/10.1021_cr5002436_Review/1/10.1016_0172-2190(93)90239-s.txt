Reflection of the legal status of pa-

Tribiahn,

Dok. 
(Germany), 
Vol. 44, No. 4, pp. 241-2.53, 1993. The 
authors review the contents of a number 
of online and CD-ROM 
databases with 
respect to legal status information. 
A 
patent family including 
an international 
and a European 
application 
is used as 
an example to compare the information 
presented 
in the various databases. 
An 
mtroduction 
is given to the internation- 
al, European 
and national 
application 
procedures.

generation 
oi 
topological 
fragments 
from generically 
expressed components 
of generic struc- 
tures 
is described. 
Fragments 
derived 
wholly 
from 
within 
a component 
or 
partial structure (PS) are termed intra-PS 
fragments, while those which span partial 
structures are termed inter-PS fragments. 
Generic 
partial structures, 
described 
in 
intensional 
terms by homologous 
series 
identifiers (HSIS!, are represented 
in the 
extended connection table representation 
(ECTR) 
as a list of default or explicit 
parameter values. The method described 
compares 
the numerical 
parameters 
of 
the HSI with similar 
parameters 
de- 
rived from each topological 
fragment 
descriptor in the screen set in order that 
a subset of fragments can be identified. 
This subset represents those fragments of 
the screen set which lie within the scope 
of the intensional 
description. 
These 
fragments 
are thus identified 
by means 
of a search of the entire fragment 
set. 
A tree-structured 
dictionary of fragments 
(augmented 
atoms and linear atom/bond 
sequences) 
is used as the basis for gen- 
eration, 
ising 
a depth-first 
trace. The 
leaves of the dictionarv tree uoint to the 
parameter 
descriptions 
of the fragment 
being 
generated- 
All fragments 
which 
are identified 
in this wav are regarded 
as being optional 
to the structure 
and 
contribute 
to the optional 
component 
(poss screen) of the two-part bit screen 
representation 
of the generic structure.

1993. China’s Patent Law ‘bidame effec: 
tive from 1 April 1985. It protects three 
kinds of patent: 
patent 
for invention; 
patent for utility mode1 and patent for 
design. 
China’s 
patent 
system 
adopts 
deferred 
examination 
for the patent of 
invention. 
The Chinese 
Patent 
Office 
publishes 
a lot of documents 
including 
specifications, 
Official Gazette, 
indexes, 
etc., has created the databases of Chinese 
patent 
documents, 
and provides online 
retrieval 
services 
both 
at home 
and 
abroad. The Chinese patent information 
system includes three kinds of lever insti- 
tute: the Patent Documentation 
Division 
and Automation 
Division of the Chinese 
Patent Office. more than 20 oatent infor- 
mation divisibns 
in provincial 
institutes

and 64 Chinese 
patent document depository libraries.

Protecting your biotechnology inven- 
tions. Halluin, A. P. Chemtech, 
Vol. 23, 
No. 3, pp. 52-58,1993. The value of your 
patent portfolio may depend on how well 
you can defend it against infringement 
and other litigation.

Reflections on innovation, 
invention, 
and industrial 
policy. Heilmeier, 
G. H. 
Chemtech Vol. 23, No. 5, pp. 7-9, 1993. 
The invention 
and commercialization 
of 
liquid crystal display technology 
is an 
example of a breakthrough 
that was not 
exploited where it was invented. 
A ‘No 
Excuse’ “technology 
transfer 
policy can 
keep this from happening.
