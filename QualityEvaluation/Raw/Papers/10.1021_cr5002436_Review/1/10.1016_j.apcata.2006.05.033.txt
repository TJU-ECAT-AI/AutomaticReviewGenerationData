The Publisher regrets errors which were introduced during the typesetting of the above-mentioned article.
On page 90, in the right-hand column six lines from the end of the ﬁrst paragraph the sentence
The additional hydrogen consumption peak at 530 8C on the sample 0.5Pt–4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another,
less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc.
Should have read
The additional hydrogen consumption peak at 530 8C on the sample 0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another,
less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc.
There was also an error in Table 4. The corrected table is reproduced below.

In last sentence on page 94, continued on page 95, read
In the absence of platinum or after subsequent impregnation
of the zeolite with both zinc and platinum, less active and less
stable catalysts are obtained, e.g., the zeolites 4.2Zn,Na-
mordenite and 0.5Pt/2.6Zn,Na-mordenite (Fig. 6).
