Abstract 
The effect of hydrothermal treatment (HTT) of -alumina on the state of its surface 
functional cover, anchoring of hexachloroplatinate, and properties of platinum sites was 
investigated. Hydrothermal treatment of -Al2O3 was found to increase the fraction of 
surface bridging OH groups and concentration of Lewis acid sites (LAS) and alter the 
metal complex–support interaction. Adsorption of hexachloroplatinate on the support 
surface is accompanied mainly by the formation of outer-sphere complexes, which are 
characterized by a lower reduction temperature. As a result, dispersion and electronic 
state of supported platinum are changed. Influence of -Al2O3 hydrothermal treatment 
on the catalytic properties of Pt/Al2O3 in n-hexane transformations and propane 
dehydrogenation was demonstrated. The revealed effect of -Al2O3 hydrothermal 
treatment on the formation of platinum sites in Pt/Al2O3 catalysts can be of fundamental 
importance for the steps of supported system synthesis where solid phase is contacting 
with water and aqueous solutions (impregnation and drying).

1. Introduction 
A unique combination of the surface acid-base properties and pore structure 
makes -alumina a convenient support for metal catalysts, in particular Pt/-Al2O3 [1, 
2]. Platinum-on-alumina composites are widely used in gasoline reforming and 
isomerization of normal alkanes C5-C6 [1, 3]. The preparation procedure of Pt/-Al2O3 
catalytic systems includes several steps: deposition of active metal usually from an 
aqueous solution of H2[PtCl6], drying, and thermoactivation. Many works [1, 4-15] 
consider the regularities of active site formation at each synthesis step. The accumulated 
data provided substantial advances not only in understanding the main transformations 
of a precursor compound during the synthesis of supported catalysts, but also in the 
deliberate synthesis of this catalytic system with specified properties by introducing 
changes into a certain step. 
The metal complex–support interaction at the deposition step can affect 
properties of the final catalyst; the interaction strongly depends not only on the chemical 
composition of precursor, but also on the nature of surface adsorption sites [4-9, 13-15]. 
The adsorption sites of -Al2O3 are represented both by the hydroxyl groups and the 
Lewis acid sites (LAS). The relative content of certain functional groups on the oxide 
surface is determined to a great extent by phase homogeneity of the support. Changes in 
the phase composition of support may occur due to uncontrolled effect of water during 
the catalyst synthesis and storage. It was found that even at room temperature the action 
of water on -Al2O3 leads to the formation of aluminum trihydroxide phase [16-20]: 
γ-Al2O3 + 3H2O         2Al(OH)3.                                  (1) 
The formation rate and type of Al(OH)3 modifications (gibbsite, bayerite) depend on the 
temperature, exposure time, and pH of the medium [18-20].

The most pronounced changes in the phase composition of alumina support are 
observed under hydrothermal conditions, which can take place both during pretreatment 
of the support and drying of the catalysts after contacting with aqueous solutions. The 
hydrothermal treatment (HTT) of -Al2O3 at temperatures up to 350 C leads to 
boehmite [18, 21-26]: 
γ-Al2O3 + H2O         2γ-AlO(OH).                               (2) 
HTT produces changes in the pore structure of -Al2O3 [18, 21, 22, 24-26]. 
Efficient control of the temperature and exposure time made HTT applicable to the 
synthesis of aluminum oxides with variable texture characteristics [21, 22]. Thus, 
variation of the HTT temperature in the range of 100-350 C led to alumina with 
specific surface area of 200 to 70 m2/g and effective pore diameter of 90 to 340 Å [22]. 
However, data concerning the effect of HTT on the acid-base properties of -
Al2O3 surface are quite scarce. Recently, IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine was used 
to demonstrate that HTT of -alumina at 200 С for 6 h decreases the total concentration 
of LAS from 342 to 42 mol/g [25]. Qualitative data indicating the effect of HTT on the 
state of hydroxyl cover of the -Al2O3 surface are reported [23, 24]. An IR spectroscopy 
study [24] revealed that HTT of -Al2O3 at 140 C followed by calcination at 550 C 
increases the intensity of absorption bands at 3676 and 3731 cm–1 during the first 2 h of 
the treatment (these bands were assigned by the authors to the OH stretching vibrations 
of the bridging group bound to tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated aluminum 
atoms and the terminal group bound to octahedrally coordinated aluminum atom). A 
more prolonged treatment (6-24 h) decreases the intensity of these absorption bands. 
Meanwhile, a 24 h HTT produces nearly a twofold increase in the concentration of 
weak LAS, as shown by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine.

The goal of the present work was to acquire quantitative data about the effect of 
-Al2O3 interaction with water under hydrothermal conditions on the relative content of 
various functional groups on the alumina surface. Besides, it was great important to 
determine the extent to which changes in the composition of functional cover of the 
support surface could alter its adsorption properties toward H2[PtCl6] and the nature of 
nascent platinum sites in Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts. 
 
2. Experimental 
2.1. Sample preparation 
The study was carried out using -Al2O3 purchased from Condea Chemie 
GmbH; its grain size was 0.1-0.25 mm. This aluminum oxide was a high-purity: 
according to the manufacturer specification sodium and iron content was equal to 0.003 
and 0.021 wt. %, respectively. HTT was performed in titanium autoclaves. The alumina 
samples were placed in the autoclaves and flooded with distilled water. The ratio of 
solid and liquid phases was maintained constant at 1:25 (wt.) in all the experiments. The 
HTT temperature and time were varied from 50 to 200 C and from 0.5 to 12 h, 
respectively. After the treatment, the support samples were separated from the liquid 
phase by filtration and dried in air and then in a drying oven at 120 C. For further 
investigations, the alumina samples after HTT and drying were used with or without 
thermal treatment in a muffle furnace at 550 C. Prehistory of the alumina samples is 
always clarified in the text. 
In the synthesis of supported platinum-on-alumina catalysts, aqueous solutions 
of hexachloroplatinic acid with a specified concentration, which were prepared from 
crystalline hydrate H2[PtCl6]∙6H2O (pure grade, Aurat), were used as precursors. The

adsorption isotherms of H2[PtCl6] on alumina supports were obtained by the separate 
sample method with the weight ratio of support to H2[PtCl6] solution equal to 1:25 
(20±1 C). The pH values of the solutions were controlled using an InLab Easy BNC 
combined electrode (Mettler Toledo) on a SevenMulti device (Mettler Toledo). 
Platinum concentration in the solutions was determined photometrically. The method is 
based on the formation of a stained complex with tin chloride in a hydrochloric solution 
[27]. 
Samples of supported platinum catalysts were prepared by impregnation of 
support in an excess of H2[PtCl6] solution. The amount of platinum in the solution was 
less than or equal to the adsorption capacity of the support. Platinum adsorption was 
carried out for 20 min. In this case, virtually a complete adsorption of platinum from the 
solution was attained; dissolution of the support and passage of Al3+ into solution could 
be neglected due to a very low rate of the process [28]. After the impregnation, the 
samples were carefully washed with water to remove non-chemisorbed solution 
components from the pore space of the support and then dried in air at room 
temperature. These samples were denoted as H2[PtCl6]/Al2O3.  
For platinum content determination samples were dried at 120 C and then 
calcined at 550 C. Platinum content was measured photometrically. Preliminarily, the 
weighted samples were dissolved with H2SO4 in the presence of HCl and H2O2. 
 
2.2. Methods of sample investigation 
2.2.1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
Phase composition of the -Al2O3 samples subjected to HTT was determined by 
XRD on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (recording with the Bragg-Brentano

focusing) using monochromatic CuKα radiation ( = 1.5418 Å) in an angle range 2 = 
5-80 and a step size of 0.1. Identification was made using the ICDD PDF-2 database 
(2006) (no. 10-425 and no. 21-1307). The fraction of boehmite forming from -Al2O3 
under hydrothermal conditions was estimated from the area of reflection (002), which is 
typical of this phase, using a calibration curve. 
 
2.2.2. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
The effect of -Al2O3 HTT on the morphology of oxide surface was investigated 
by the SEM method with a JSM-6460 LV (JEOL) instrument, using Au-coated samples 
and acceleration voltage of 20 kV. 
 
2.2.3. 27Al and 195Pt magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) 
27Al MAS NMR spectra were recorded at a Larmor frequency of 104 MHz on an 
Аvance-400 (9.4 T) NMR spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a SB4 multinuclear 
sensor (MAS). The tested samples were placed in 4-mm zirconia rotors and spun at the 
magic angle (5444') with a frequency of 104 Hz. Single-pulse experiments were carried 
out with the following parameters: pulse width 2.5 s, pulse-delay time before 
quantization 6.5 s, pulse repetition time 0.5 s, window width 20.8 kHz, number of data 
points 4000, total number of pulses 1024. Chemical shifts are referenced with respect to 
1 M AlCl3 aqueous solution. The relative content of structural aluminum-oxygen 
polyhedra (aluminum in tetrahedral, pentahedral and octahedral environments) in the 
samples of support was found from the 27Al MAS NMR spectra. For quantitative 
analysis, the obtained NMR spectra were deconvoluted using the Pearson VII function 
[29], and each band was integrated.

The 195Pt MAS NMR spectra of H2[PtCl6]/Al2O3 samples were taken at a 
Larmor frequency of 86 MHz using an aqueous solution of H2[PtCl6] with the 
concentration 0.03 M as external standard. The pulse time was 13 s, pulse-delay time 
before quantization 16 s, pulse repetition time 0.7 s, window width 70 kHz, number of 
data points 16000, and total number of pulses 4096. 
 
2.2.4. Low-temperature nitrogen adsorption 
The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms on the alumina samples were 
obtained at 77 K in a volumetric vacuum static unit ASAP-2020 (Micromeritics). 
Before measurements, the samples subjected to HTT at different temperatures were 
calcined at 550 C for 3 h. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area SBET was 
measured from the adsorption isotherm in the range of equilibrium relative pressures of 
nitrogen P/P0 = 0.05-0.25. For SBET calculation, the molecular area of nitrogen in a 
filled monolayer was taken equal to 0.162 nm2. The adsorption pore volume (Vads) was 
determined from the nitrogen adsorption at P/P0 = 0.990, assuming the adsorbate 
density equal to that of normal liquid, 0.02887 mol/cm3. The differential 
characteristics—pore size distribution (PSD) curves—were found by the Barrett-Joyner-
Halenda method. 
 
2.2.5. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy 
FTIR spectra of the surface hydroxyl groups were recorded in a transmission 
mode on an IRPrestige-21 (Shimadzu) spectrometer over the range of 400-4000 cm–1 
with a resolution of 4 cm–1. Density of the samples pressed into pellets without a binder 
was 20-30 mg/cm2. For adsorption measurements, they were placed in a quartz cell with

CaF2 windows and outgassed in a vacuum adsorption setup (500 C, 2 h, pressure below 
3×10-4 mbar). Acidic properties of the samples were tested by sequential adsorption of 
CO at 77 K. 
The concentration of active sites on the sample surface was calculated as N = 
A·S/(p·A0), where A0 is the integral absorption coefficient (integral intensity of 
absorption band for 1 mol of the adsorbate per 1 cm2 cross-section of the light flux), р 
is the weight of a sample pellet (g), S is the surface area of a sample pellet (cm2), and A 
is the integral absorbance (cm–1) determined in accordance with the Beer–Lambert–
Bouguer law [30]. 
The concentration of surface OH groups was estimated from the integral 
intensities of absorption bands ОH in the region of 3650-3800 cm–1 using A0 = 5.3 
cm/mol [31]. In the estimation of the concentration of Lewis acid sites, А0 was taken to 
depend on the adsorption site type (strength) and the following А0 values (cm/mol) 
were used: 1.25 (2225 cm–1), 1.0 (2205 cm–1), and 0.9 (2190 and 2180 cm–1) [32]. 
Absorbances (А) were determined after the deconvolution of the observed spectrum into 
its components using the Gauss function. 
 
2.2.6. Point of zero charge (PZC) measurements 
Surface acid-base properties of the alumina supports at the solid-liquid interface 
were estimated by determining the PZC according to a method developed by Park and 
Regalbuto [33]. The samples were placed in aqueous solutions with different initial 
values of pH. The pH values were measured until the equilibrium was established. 
Therewith, PZC corresponded to a plateau on the curve of final (equilibrium) pH versus 
the initial рН. Solutions with the initial pH value ranging from 1 to 13 were prepared

with HCl and NaOH. All the measurements were performed using an InLab Easy BNC 
combined electrode (Mettler Toledo) on a SevenMulti device (Mettler Toledo). 
 
2.2.7. UV-VIS diffuse reflectance (UV-VIS DR) spectroscopy 
Electronic spectra of the H2[PtCl6]/Al2O3 samples dried in air at room 
temperature were recorded on a UV-2501 PC (Shimadzu) spectrometer with an ISR-
240A diffuse reflectance attachment in the range of 11000-54000 cm–1 with a resolution 
of 2 nm (500 cm–1). BaSO4 was employed as a reflection standard. UV-VIS DR spectra 
were transformed into the Kubelka-Munk function calculated as F(R) = (1-R)2/2R, 
where R is the experimentally measured reflectivity coefficient of the samples. 
 
2.2.8. Temperature-programmed reduction by H2 (TPR). Method of Н2 and CO 
chemisorption 
The processes of hydrogen consumption were investigated on an AutoChem II 
2920 (Micromeritics) precision chemisorption analyzer with a heat conductivity 
detector. Before measurements, the H2[PtCl6]/Al2O3 samples were dried in air at room 
temperature. The TPR experiments were performed with a mixture of 10 % H2 and 
argon (flow rate was equal to 25 mL/min) at 35-450 °С with the heating ramp of 10 
oC/min. Chemisorption of hydrogen or carbon monoxide was carried out after TPR and 
cooling the catalyst in an inert gas to the temperature of experiment. A 10 % H2–Ar or 9 
% СО–Не mixture was fed in pulses at equal time intervals into a flow of inert carrier 
gas, respectively, argon or helium. The batching was performed at room temperature 
until the detector signal became constant.

It is known that the adsorption stoichiometry H/Pt may be greater than unity due 
to multiple adsorption of hydrogen on certain Pt sites [34, 35]. However, the use of 
stoichiometry H/Pt = 1 when calculating the metal dispersion is justified [35]. Carbon 
monoxide can be chemisorbed in various forms, and adsorption stoichiometry CO/Pt 
may differ from unity [35, 36]. A CO/Pt stoichiometry of 1 has commonly been used, 
although bridged carbon monoxide coexists with the predominant linear form [35]. 
Thus, dispersions of the metal, DPt (H2) and DPt (CO), were calculated taking into 
account the sorption stoichiometry Н/Pt = 1 and СО/Pt = 1. 
 
2.2.9. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) 
Photoelectronic spectra of the Pt/Al2O3 samples were obtained on a SPECS 
(Germany) photoelectron spectrometer as described in [37]. The spectrometer was 
equipped with two X-ray sources. One source with double Al/Mg anode works without 
monochromator, whereas another source with a double Al/Ag anode – with 
monochromator. Application of monochromator narrows essentially the energy width of 
the exciting irradiation and, hence, the width of the photoemission lines. 
Before measurements, the samples were dried at 120 C, calcined at 550 C and 
reduced in flowing H2 at 450 C. Powdery samples were fixed on a sample holder using 
a double-side conductive adhesive tape. Samples were introduced in the spectrometer 
via fast entry lock system. XPS measurements were carried out in a UHV analyzer 
chamber at a base pressure of 5×10−9 Torr. For each sample, spectra were recorded 
using non-monochromatic MgK (h = 1253.6 eV) and monochromatic AgL(h = 
2984.3 eV) irradiations. Before the measurements, the binding energy (BE) scale was 
calibrated against the characteristic lines of metallic gold and copper – Au4f7/2 at 84.0

eV and Cu2p3/2 at 932.6 eV, respectively. To take into account the charging effect 
appeared for non-conducting substances as result of photoemission under MgK 
irradiation, the C1s line was used as internal reference, with the BE of 284.8 eV. The 
calibration of the spectra excited with AgL irradiation was performed using a set of 
XPS lines with lower BE, which were predominantly measured with MgK irradiation. 
 
2.2.10. Catalytic testing of Pt/Al2O3 samples 
Propane dehydrogenation. Catalytic properties of the supported Pt/Al2O3 
systems were investigated in a fixed-bed flow reactor. The feed stream was formed by 
mixing of gaseous hydrogen (> 99.96 vol. %, Novosibirsk Chemical Concentrates 
Plant) and propane (99.95 %, PBM Gas Ltd.). Before testing, the samples were dried at 
120 C, calcined at 550 C and reduced in flowing H2 in the reactor at 550 C for 1 h. 
Testing of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts (1.000 g) was carried out at the following reaction 
conditions as reported elsewhere [38, 39]: 550 C for reaction temperature, atmospheric 
pressure, H2/C3H8 = 0.25 (molar ratio) and the propane weight hourly space velocity 
(WHSV) is 4.0 h-1. The reaction products were analyzed on line on an Khromos GKh-
1000 chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and column Rt-Alumina 
Plot (50 m × 0.53 mm). The analysis was made in the isothermal mode at the 
temperature of 80 C. 
At the steady-state conditions with the values of propane conversion of 17-20 % 
the catalytic reactor was considered as a differential one. The reaction rate normalized 
per 1 g of the catalyst and a turnover frequency for the formation of propylene (TOF) 
were calculated according to equations:

n-Hexane transformation. A study of the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in the reactions of n-
hexane transformation were carried out at atmospheric pressure on a microcatalytic 
setup in the pulse mode. The reaction mixture was obtained by saturation of hydrogen 
(> 99.96 vol. %, Novosibirsk Chemical Concentrates Plant) with n-hexane (> 99 wt. %, 
Reakhim) in a saturator at 35.0 °С. Before testing, the samples were dried at 120 C and 
calcined at 550 C. The samples were tested at a constant molar ratio H2/C6H14 = 2 and 
contact time 5 s. A 0.5 g catalyst sample was placed in a U-shaped glass reactor and 
reduced before measurement in flowing hydrogen at 450 C for 2 h. The testing was 
performed at a temperature of 450 C. The pulse volume was 30 L/mg. The initial 
reactant and reaction products were analyzed on line by gas liquid chromatography. A 
chromatograph (Carlo Erba Instruments) was equipped with a flame ionization detector 
and capillary column (25 m × 0.2 mm) with the stationary liquid phase SE-54. To 
improve chromatographic separation efficiency, the analysis was made in the 
temperature-programmed mode.

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Effect of HTT on the structural and texture characteristics of γ-Al2O3 
HTT of -alumina leads to the hydroxide phase of boehmite -AlO(OH) 
according to Eq. (2) (Fig. 1a and b). Fig. 1b displays a powder diffraction pattern of the 
sample after HTT at 200 C, which is a maximum temperature used in the study. Under 
such conditions, the phase transition -alumina → boehmite is brought to completion. 
However, the boehmite fraction in the composition of alumina can readily be controlled 
by varying the treatment temperature and time. Trends of increasing the content of 
boehmite phase with the temperature and time of HTT are presented in Table 1. 
A subsequent calcination (550 C) of the samples subjected to HTT regenerates 
the oxide phase due to dehydration of boehmite (Fig. 1c). However, analysis of the 
structural data revealed some distinctions between the initial alumina and that subjected 
to HTT. The initial -Al2O3 has a cubic lattice with the parameter a = 7.900 Å, whereas 
structure of the oxide obtained by dehydration of boehmite has a tetragonal distortion, 
which is indicated by splitting of the reflection (400) [40-42]. In this case, with the 
lattice parameters a = b = 7.960 Å and c = 7.840 Å, the c/a ratio is equal to 0.985, which 
points to a considerable tetragonal distortion, according to [42, 43]. Yanagida and 
Yamaguchi reported [43] that a growth of the degree of tetragonality, which is reflected 
by lowering the c/a ratio from 0.982 to 0.966, increases the amount of hydroxyl groups 
on the -Al2O3 surface. 
As shown by XRD data, -alumina after HTT is well crystallized as compared to 
the initial -Al2O3: the average size of crystallites grows from 4.5 to 7.7 nm. According 
to Vidruk et al. [44], an increased size of -Al2O3 crystallites can initiate a growth of the 
surface Lewis acidity.

The XRD data agree with the results obtained for alumina samples by 27Al MAS 
NMR. The spectra have up to three resonances with the chemical shifts at 10, 45 and 70 
ppm, which correspond to aluminum atoms in octa-, penta- and tetrahedral oxygen 
environments, respectively. Deconvolution and integration of NMR spectra allowed the 
quantitative assessment of the relative content of different aluminum-oxygen polyhedra 
in the samples. The obtained data are listed in Table 2. After a severe HTT (180 or 200 
C, 3 h), structure of the samples is represented almost by aluminum-oxygen octahedra, 
which is typical of the hydroxide phase. However, a subsequent heat treatment at 550 
C restored the ratio of structural polyhedra AlO6 (76 %), AlO4 (20 %) and AlO5 (4 %) 
typical of -Аl2O3 [45]. 
SEM was used to investigate the effect of HTT on the -Аl2O3 morphology. 
HTT at 180 C for 3 h and subsequent heat treatment lead to the formation of plate-like 
particles 0.5-1 m in length (Fig. 2) on the -Аl2O3 surface. Earlier, Jun-Cheng et al. 
[24] observed the formation of boehmite crystals of a similar shape during HTT of -
Аl2O3. Retention of the particle shape after calcination of the formed boehmite (Fig. 2b) 
may be related to the topotactic nature of boehmite → -Аl2O3 transition [41]. 
Low-temperature nitrogen adsorption isotherms were obtained to elucidate the 
effect of HTT on the texture parameters of alumina samples (the samples were calcined 
at 550 C for 3 h after HTT at different temperatures). One can see from Table 3 that 
specific surface area, total pore volume and effective pore diameter of alumina changed 
inappreciably after the introduction of HTT performed at 50-180 C for 3 h. Moreover, 
some growth of the alumina surface area is observed at HTT temperatures up to 150 C, 
which is in agreement with literature data [22]. Nearly a twofold decrease in the specific 
surface area occurred only when the HTT temperature was raised to 200 C (at this

temperature the initial alumina is completely transformed into boehmite, Table 1) and 
the -Аl2O3 structure was restored during the calcination. The adsorption pore volume 
did not change in the process because the fraction of large pores increased. Analysis of 
the PSD curves showed that a uniform distribution with the prevailing average pore 
diameter of ca. 75 Å is retained up to the HTT temperature of 150 C. The fraction of 
pores with the diameter 80-110 Å increases at the treatment temperature of 180 C, 
whereas pores with the diameter 300 Å prevail at 200 C. 
Aluminum oxide is restored upon calcination; nevertheless, there are changes in 
the -Al2O3 pore structure that are caused by the formation of boehmite crystallites via 
the dissolution-precipitation route under hydrothermal conditions [21]. The conversion 
of -Al2O3 to boehmite at HTT essentially involves rehydration of -Al2O3 according to 
Eq. (2). A supposed mechanism of rehydration includes the dissociative adsorption of 
water on the anion vacancies of -Al2O3 followed by the diffusion of hydroxyl groups 
[26]. These processes lead to the formation and recrystallization of boehmite with larger 
crystallites, which is confirmed by the XRD data shown above. Thus, the formation of 
large boehmite crystallites may be responsible for the observed enlargement of pores in 
the hydrothermally treated and calcined alumina samples. 
 
3.2. Effect of HTT on the state of γ-Al2O3 surface functional cover 
The effect of HTT step on the concentration and ratio of the -Аl2O3 surface 
functional groups was studied by FTIR spectroscopy (prior to spectroscopic 
examination, the samples were subjected to HTT at different temperatures and then 
calcined at 550 C). In the region of O-H stretching vibrations, the spectra of initial -
Аl2O3 and Аl2O3 samples after HTT (Fig. 3) have seven absorption bands that 
Page 19 of 57

characterize the isolated OH groups: 3790, 3770, 3760, 3745-3730, 3710, 3690 and 
3670 cm–1. A broad absorption band in the region of 3600 cm–1 is assigned to the 
hydrogen-bonded OH groups. The assignment of absorption bands of the isolated 
surface OH groups [32, 46-50] and their concentrations are indicated in Table 4. 
The quantitative analysis of spectroscopic data revealed certain changes in the 
relative content of different surface OH groups on -Al2O3 with elevation of HTT 
temperature, the trend being most pronounced at 200 C (Table 4). The fraction of low-
frequency bridging hydroxyl groups (ОН = 3710-3670 cm–1) increased from 50 to 70 % 
of the total amount of OH groups with a simultaneous decrease in the content of 
terminal OH groups (absorption bands in the region of 3790-3760 cm–1) and especially 
in the content of bridging AlO(OH)AlO group (ОН = 3730 cm–1). According to [9, 51], 
the high-frequency hydroxyl groups, which have more pronounced base properties, are 
likely to participate in coordination binding of platinum(IV) chloride complexes; so, the 
observed decrease in their amount should alter the interaction of the modified support 
with a metal complex precursor during the synthesis of supported catalysts. 
As follows from the analysis of FTIR spectra of adsorbed CO (Table 5), HTT 
increases the concentration of all LAS types on the -Al2O3 surface: weak (2180 and 
2190 cm–1), medium strength (2205 cm–1), and strong (2225 cm–1). Most distinct is an 
increase in the concentration of weak LAS, which are characterized by the absorption 
band СО = 2180 cm–1. The LAS strength differentiation was similar to that reported in 
literature [32, 49, 52]. 
Thus, as follows from FTIR spectroscopy data, the introduction of the HTT step 
before calcination of alumina can change the relative content of different types of 
functional groups on the -Al2O3 surface: the fraction of low-frequency bridging OH 
Page 20 of 57

groups increases, and Lewis acidity of the oxide surface grows. The observed changes 
may be related to structural transformations occurring at HTT and calcination of 
alumina. In particular, the appearance of structural tetragonality indicated by XRD data 
is probably the reason for surface phenomena as reported in [43]. On the other hand, the 
surface of boehmite crystallites is enriched with OH groups [41, 53] and the calcination 
causes the dehydration and the formation of coordinatively unsaturated aluminum 
cations on the surface of the formed alumina. Thus, an increase of Lewis acidity may 
occur. In addition, the formation of LAS may be due to a change in the nanocrystalline 
contact interface as a result of densification of nanocrystal assemblies at high-
temperature treatment [44]. This densification leads to a growth in the size of -Al2O3 
crystallites, a decrease in specific surface area and an increase in the concentration of 
LAS. 
PZC (the pH value at which surface charge is equal to zero at a total absence of 
positive and negative charges) is convenient for estimating the state of the surface at the 
interface with an aqueous solution. This parameter makes it possible not only to assess 
acid-base features of the surface, but also to predict its adsorption properties toward 
components of the solution. In this work, PZC was measured by the Park-Regalbuto 
method [33] for a sample of initial -Al2O3 and for alumina samples subjected to HTT 
and subsequent heat treatment. As follows from the measurements (Fig. 4), HTT 
decreased the PZC value and buffer capacity (reflected by extension of a plateau) with 
respect to initial support. This points to an increased deprotonation activity of the 
surface OH groups and confirms the spectroscopic data according to which the repeated 
calcination restores the phase composition, but cannot completely restore the surface 
properties (the fraction of low-frequency bridging OH groups increased).

3.3. Effect of γ-Al2O3 HTT on the formation of platinum sites in Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts 
3.3.1. Effect of γ-Al2O3 HTT on the adsorption and composition of adsorbed Pt(IV) 
complexes 
To estimate the effect of HTT on the adsorption properties of alumina with 
respect to anionic chloride complexes of platinum(IV), the [PtCl6]2– adsorption 
isotherms were obtained for two groups of -Al2O3 samples: the samples subjected to 
HTT at different temperatures (Fig. 5a) and those subjected not only to HTT, but also to 
calcination at 550 C (Fig. 5b). The obtained isotherms are satisfactorily described by 
the Langmuir equation; their analysis by the linear anamorphosis method allowed us to 
calculate the values of adsorption capacity am. 
As follows from the results of adsorption experiments (Fig. 5a), elevation of the 
temperature of alumina HTT, which increases the amount of boehmite phase, is 
accompanied by a decrease in adsorption capacity of the support with respect to 
[PtCl6]2–. Even under mild HTT conditions (100-150 C, 3 h), the maximum amount of 
adsorbed platinum diminishes appreciably, from 0.24 to 0.20-0.17 mmol Pt/g, which 
corresponds to a decrease in the platinum content of the sample from 4.7 to 3.9-3.3 wt. 
%. The elevation of HTT temperature to 200 C, which leads to the formation of  
hydroxide phase and, accordingly, to an increase in the relative content of bridging OH 
groups on the support surface, decreases nearly 10-fold the value of adsorption capacity 
am. 
Calcination of alumina samples after the HTT step regenerates the oxide phase 
and increases the adsorption capacity of the support. However, restoration of the 
adsorption capacity to the value typical of initial -Al2O3 does not occur (Fig. 5b). Thus,

HTT at 150 and 180 C, which produces no changes in the texture parameters of the 
support (Table 3), can substantially affect the adsorption properties of alumina surface. 
Within the concept of chloroplatinate anchoring mechanism involving OH 
groups of the alumina surface [5-9, 12-14], the observed decrease in the adsorption 
capacity can be attributed to a diminishing effect of HTT on the content of OH groups, 
which are necessary for chemisorption anchoring of the platinum chloride complexes. 
The FTIR spectroscopy data allow a conclusion that such hydroxyl groups on the -
Al2O3 surface are represented by the most basic terminal OH groups and by the bridging 
AlO(OH)AlO group, their amount on the alumina surface decreasing due to introduction 
of the hydrothermal step. 
The effect of HTT on the chemical composition of metal complexes anchored on 
the oxide surface was investigated by UV-VIS DR spectroscopy. It is known [4, 8, 9, 
54, 55] that the band at ca. 38000 cm–1 in the electronic spectrum of [PtCl6]2– 
corresponds to the electron transition involving two  orbitals of chlorine and 
characterizes the charge transfer Cl → Pt (1t2u(),2t1u()→2eg(z2,x2-y2)). The band at 
ca. 50000 cm–1 is also assigned to a Cl → Pt transition, but one involving  orbitals of 
the ligand (1t1u()→2eg(z2,x2-y2)). The first band is used conventionally to identify the 
[PtCl6]2– complex. The platinum(IV) complexes with chloride ligands partially 
substituted by the oxygen-containing ones (H2O and ОН) have the bands in a range of 
higher wavenumbers, 39000-43000 cm–1. Analysis of the electronic spectra showed 
(Fig. 6) that platinum complexes adsorbed on the initial -Al2O3 are characterized by a 
broad absorption region (Fig. 6, spectrum 1), which is related to the presence of 
complexes with inhomogeneous chemical composition (a degree of hydrolysis). 
According to the earlier obtained EXAFS data [56], their chemical composition

corresponds to the averaged formula PtCl3O3. After HTT of the alumina support, the 
composition of platinum complexes anchored on its surface becomes more 
homogeneous. Thus, the band at 38000 cm–1 is observed for the sample where -Al2O3 
was preliminarily subjected to HTT at 180 C, which indicates the preferential binding 
of non-hydrolyzed chloride complexes (Fig. 6, spectrum 2). In the case of alumina 
calcined at 550 C after HTT, shape of the spectrum (Fig. 6, spectrum 3) differs from 
the two preceding ones. It means that high-temperature treatment did not restore the 
surface properties to the full extent, and a distinct band at 38000 cm–1 in spectrum 3 
testifies that its main difference from spectrum 1 is the presence of a greater fraction of 
non-hydrolyzed forms of the platinum complexes. 
The effect of alumina HTT on the metal complex–support interaction was 
investigated by 195Pt MAS NMR. It is known that the interaction of metal complex with 
support can affect the type of signals in 195Pt NMR spectrum. Thus, the adsorption of 
chloroplatinate via electrostatic interaction with the surface (the formation of outer-
sphere complexes) is not accompanied by a symmetry distortion of the metal complex 
polyhedra. In such case, the NMR spectrum contains a signal from adsorbed anions 
[PtCl6]2– with a chemical shift in the region of their absorption in a solution. Exchange 
interactions of the complexes with hydroxyl groups of the oxide surface (the formation 
of inner-sphere complexes) can result in a considerable broadening or vanishing of the 
signal from the nuclei of adsorbed ions [7-9, 13, 14]. Fig. 7 shows the 195Pt NMR 
spectra characterizing platinum complexes adsorbed on the initial -Al2O3 and on the 
alumina subjected to HTT. In the first case, even with a maximum amount of adsorbed 
complexes (the platinum content of 4.5 wt. %), there is a weak signal in the region of 40 
ppm corresponding to adsorbed [PtCl6]2–, which virtually vanishes during the long-term 
Page 24 of 57

22 
drying of the sample at room temperature. Hydrolyzed forms of the complexes are more 
prone to coordination anchoring; there are no signals in the region of chemical shifts 
typical of the aqua or hydroxo complexes [7, 14]. As a result of HTT of the support at 
180 C, even for a half amount of adsorbed complexes (the platinum content of 2.0 wt. 
%) a resonance is observed with the same position of chemical shift at 40 ppm, which 
intensity is much higher and does not change for a long time (Fig. 7, spectrum 2). The 
obtained result agrees with the UV-VIS DR spectroscopy data indicating an increase in 
the fraction of chloride non-hydrolyzed (outer-sphere) platinum species on the support 
surface. Besides, according to the 195Pt NMR data, changes occur also in the anchoring 
mechanism of the complexes: there is an increase in the fraction of complexes adsorbed 
via electrostatic interaction (the formation of outer-sphere complexes): 
≡Al – OH + H3O+ + [PtCl6]2–          ≡ Al – OH2
+ ∙∙∙ [PtCl6]2– + H2O.     (6) 
Taking into account that HTT of -Al2O3 leads to the formation of boehmite phase with 
the bridging OH groups on its surface [41, 53], it can be expected that such groups are 
involved in the anchoring of platinum(IV) chloride complexes according to Eq. (6). 
 
3.3.2. Effect of γ-Al2O3 HTT on the formation and properties of supported platinum 
As follows from the analysis of adsorption and spectral data, HTT decreases the 
amount of adsorption sites on the alumina surface, primarily those that provide 
coordination anchoring of platinum complexes. This changes the strength of the 
interaction between metal complex and support, which may further affect the formation 
conditions and properties of supported platinum particles. 
TPR is among the methods employed for estimating the strength of the metal 
complex–support interaction. The TPR profile of H2[PtCl6]/Al2O3 samples usually has 
Page 25 of 57

two hydrogen consumption regions in the temperature ranges of 150-250 C and 250-
400 C (Fig. 8). Therewith, hydrogen consumption in the high-temperature region is 
attributed to the reduction of the most strongly anchored hydrolyzed platinum 
complexes [13, 14]. HTT of -alumina before deposition of the metal complex shifted 
the temperature maximum of main TPR peak by 40 C toward low temperatures (Fig. 8, 
curve (2)). This effect is related to a significant increase in the fraction of outer-sphere 
platinum complexes, which are characterized by a lower strength of their interaction 
with the support. Calcination performed after HTT cannot provide a complete 
restoration of the adsorption properties of alumina surface with respect to platinum(IV) 
chloride complexes (Fig. 5b); as a result, the obtained TPR profile has an intermediate 
position (Fig. 8, curve (3)). 
Dispersion of platinum particles after the reduction step was determined from H2 
and CO chemisorption. The obtained values of dispersion for the samples containing 2 
wt. % of platinum (Table 6) agree with the TPR data: an increase in the fraction of 
platinum complexes that have a less strong binding to the surface and are reduced at a 
lower temperature led to the formation of low-dispersed platinum particles. Thus, HTT 
of alumina at 180 C before anchoring of the metal complex precursor produced more 
than a 3.5-fold decrease in the dispersion of supported Pt in the reduced sample: from 
81-86 % to 19-24 %. High-temperature treatment of the support after the HTT step is 
able to increase the dispersion of supported platinum. However, the initial level of 
dispersion is not attained. Furthermore, this trend was kept for the samples with lower 
platinum content (0.5 wt. %). HTT of alumina at 200 C and subsequent calcination at 
550 C before anchoring of the precursor produced decrease in the dispersion of 
supported Pt in the reduced sample: from 85-96 % to 63-72 %.

The formation of platinum particles with a low dispersion in the absence of 
coordination binding of metal complex to the support is attributed [12] to both the 
ability of weakly bound species to migrate over the support surface and the occurrence 
of the following reactions: 
H2[PtIVCl6] → PtIICl2 + 2HCl + Cl2,                               (7) 
PtIICl2 → Pt0 + Cl2.                                           (8) 
The formation of large particles of platinum(II) chloride as an intermediate is the reason 
underlying the low dispersion of metallic platinum [12]. 
The most important result is that the introduction of HTT step leads to 
differences in the chemical composition of the adsorbed metal complex precursor, the 
mechanism of its anchoring and the conditions of platinum sites formation. It can be 
assumed that electronic state of supported Pt and catalytic properties of Pt/Al2O3 
catalysts will also be changed.  
XPS was used to estimate the oxidation state of supported platinum in reduced 
samples of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. It is well-known that analysis of Pt supported on alumina 
by XPS is complicated by overlapping Al2p and Pt4f lines if spectra are taken with the 
standard AlK or MgK irradiations [37, 57]. To decision of this problem, the 
methodology [37] consisting of application of a harder irradiation AgL for excitation 
of Pt3d5/2 line was used. 
The Pt3d5/2 core level spectrum of the reduced Pt/Al2O3 sample without HTT of 
the support (Fig. 9, spectrum 1) is characterized by a BE value 2123.5 eV. This result 
shows that complete reduction of supported platinum complexes is not occurred and 
substantial fraction of platinum metal presents in oxidation state closed to Pt2+ (BE = 
2123.5 eV for Pt2+ [37]). As a result of HTT and subsequent predominant formation of 
Page 27 of 57

25 
outer-sphere platinum complexes, the fraction of reduced metal forms with lower BE 
value (BE = 2121.8 eV for Pt0 [37]) is increased in the catalyst (Fig. 9, spectrum 2). 
It should be noted that the distinction in a platinum state is not related to the 
differences in a chemical composition of the support surface, which can be varied by 
chloride ions content. With respect to XPS data obtained using AlK irradiation, 
residual chlorine content in the Pt/Al2O3 samples is not affected by the support 
pretreatment: Cl/Al atomic ratio is equal to about 0.028 for both samples studied. 
The changes of dispersion and electronic state of supported platinum give a hope 
that catalytic properties of Pt will also be affected by preliminary HTT of alumina. It is 
well known that reactions of hydrogenation-dehydrogenation proceed with participation 
of metal sites of catalysts. So, these reactions are conventionally used to estimate a 
metal state in supported catalysts. For example, it was found that the electron-deficient 
platinum sites have a low activity in hydrogenation [58].  
In the present research, to characterize the catalytic properties of Pt sites propane 
dehydrogenation was chosen. The catalyst samples containing 0.5 wt. % of Pt and 
prepared by using of initial and HTT-modified aluminas were tested. Like 2 % 
Pt/Al2O3, these catalysts differ in platinum dispersion (Table 6) and, apparently, 
electronic state. Results of the study are presented as conversion (Fig 10a) and 
selectivities of propylene and cracking products (methane, ethane, ethylene) (Fig. 10b) 
versus time of the experiment. At the beginning, higher conversion of propane at low 
propylene selectivity is due to a significant contribution of side reactions. In particular, 
the cracking reactions are more pronounced if the catalysts without HTT of the support 
are used (Fig. 10b). At the stationary conditions (5 h of experiment), the sample with 
HTT-modified support had a higher propylene selectivity at similar conversion values.

26 
The calculation of catalytic activity (Table 7) showed that platinum in the sample with 
HTT-modified support has a higher specific activity in the reaction of propylene 
formation. At the same time, a lower specific activity of the catalyst with higher Pt 
dispersion (prepared from initial -Al2O3) could be due to the presence of a significant 
fraction of platinum in electron-deficient state (see XPS data, fig. 9). Similar relation 
between the platinum dispersion and TOF of several catalytic reactions including 
reduction type reactions was observed earlier [59]. According to this work, the negative 
trend is due to the metallic character of platinum particle is being lost as it becomes a 
smaller particle. 
  The catalytic characteristics of Pt/Al2O3 samples synthesized with or without 
HTT of the support were also compared in a model reaction of n-hexane transformation. 
Pulse mode used in the experiment allowed us to diminish the effect of deactivation and 
secondary processes, and analyze the main routes of conversion. It was demonstrated 
that even under relatively mild conditions (150 C, 3 h) HTT of the support affects not 
only the interaction between metal complex and support, but also the distribution of 
catalytic reaction products. 
At identical platinum content in the samples, HTT of the support leads to 
changes in the ratio of isomerization and cyclization products. First of all, this shows up 
as an increase in the ‘arenes / isomerization products’ and ‘benzene / 
methylcyclopentane’ weight ratios (Table 8). The ratio of benzene and substituted 
aromatic hydrocarbons remains constant in the process. It is necessary to note that n-
hexane conversion at the reaction conditions was equal to about 80 % for both samples. 
The observed differences in the catalytic properties can be attributed to changes in the 
state of supported platinum and acid-base properties of the support surface due to HTT. 
Page 29 of 57

27 
In particular, a decrease in Pt dispersion and an increase in acidity of the support can 
raise the rate of aromatization, including the formation of benzene via the expansion of 
a cyclopentane ring [60-62]. As HTT changes the dispersion and electronic state of Pt 
and increases the LAS concentration, the observed catalytic effect may be caused by the 
joint action of metallic and acidic sites. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Results of the study suggest that the action of water on -Al2O3 under 
hydrothermal conditions (up to 200 C) produces considerable changes in the texture 
characteristics and acid-base properties of the alumina surface, and subsequent high-
temperature treatment at 550 C does not provide a complete restoration of the 
properties of initial support. 
According to FTIR spectroscopy data, hydrothermal modification consists in 
changing the relative content of different types of functional groups on the -Al2O3 
surface: there occurs an increase in the fraction of low-frequency bridging OH groups 
(absorption bands at 3670-3710 cm–1) and in the concentration of LAS. Accordingly, 
the anchoring of platinum(IV) chloride complexes on the support surface is 
accompanied by an increase in the fraction of outer-sphere complexes that are 
characterized by a lower reduction temperature (below 200 C). As a result, the 
dispersion of supported platinum particles decreases. Furthermore, due to preliminary 
HTT of the support, shift of the Pt3d5/2 spectrum to lower BE values is appeared that 
corresponds to a change of Pt oxidation state, i.e. increase the fraction of reduced Pt 
forms. Such effect of HTT confirms the assumption that the most basic high-frequency 
OH groups of the -Al2O3 surface (the amount of which decreases due to HTT of 
Page 30 of 57

alumina) serve as the sites for coordination anchoring of platinum complexes. Hence, 
HTT of the support makes it possible to alter the adsorption mechanism of a precursor, 
selectively increasing the fraction of outer-sphere complexes anchored via electrostatic 
interaction. 
It is essential that introduction of the HTT step (even under relatively mild 
conditions, for example, 150 C and 3 h) affects not only the metal complex–support 
interaction and formation of supported platinum particles, but also the catalytic 
performance of the final Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. It was shown that in the model reaction of 
propane dehydrogenation there is increase in the propylene selectivity over 10 wt. % at 
similar propane conversion. Besides, in the reaction of n-hexane conversion there are 
changes in the products distribution toward the increased weight ratios of ‘arenes / 
isomerization products’ and ‘benzene / methylcyclopentane’.
