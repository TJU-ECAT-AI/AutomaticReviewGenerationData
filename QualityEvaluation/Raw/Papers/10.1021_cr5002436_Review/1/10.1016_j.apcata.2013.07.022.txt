ABSTRACT 
 
PtSn/θ-Al2O3 with various Pt and Sn compositions was prepared by a co-impregnation method using θ-Al2O3 support for n-butane 
dehydrogenation reaction. The monometallic Pt1.5/θ-Al2O3 catalyst showed severe deactivation in n-butane dehydrogenation. The bimetallic 
PtSn/θ-Al2O3 catalyst improved the n-C4
= yield and the stability. The compositions listed in order of n-C4
= yield at 823 K are as follows: 
(PtSn)1.5 > (PtSn)1.0 > (PtSn)2.0 > (PtSn)0.5 > Pt1.5 > Sn1.5. The n-C4
= yields increased with the specific metal surface area. The Sn loading was 
varied on the Pt1.5 loaded catalyst. Then, the compositions listed in order of n- C4
= yield at 823 K were as follows: (PtSn)1.5 > Pt1.5Sn1.0 > 
Pt1.5Sn2.0 > Pt1.5Sn0.5 > Pt1.5. The n-C4
= yield was maximized at a Pt/Sn weight ratio of 1.0. The n-C4
= selectivity of the Pt1.5 catalyst was 
substantially improved by the Sn addition. TEM and XRD studies indicated PtSn alloy formation on the bimetallic PtSn catalysts during the 
reduction. The PtSn alloy can increase the n-C4
= selectivity by blocking the cracking and hydrogenolysis sites of the Pt catalyst. TPR and

HAADF STEM-EDS studies suggest the reduction procedure of the Pt and Sn species. The scattered Pt oxides in the vicinity of the well-
dispersed Sn oxides were co-reduced, and then the reduced Sn metals migrated to the PtSn particles, resulting in a PtSn alloy. The specific 
metal surface area of the Pt1.5 sample was much lower than that of the (PtSn)1.5 sample. Therefore, it can be suggested that Pt metal sintering 
can be retarded by PtSn alloy formation during the reduction, resulting in high specific metal surface area. These observations demonstrate 
that the addition of Sn can enhance the activity and n-C4
= selectivity.

1. Introduction 
 
 
 
The dehydrogenation of butanes (n- and iso) into olefins has received growing attention as a substitute process for obtaining olefins 
from C4-raffinate, since oil prices have increased [1-3]. In particular, butenes obtained from the dehydrogenation of butane can be used as a 
feedstock for the production of 1,4-butadiene. The butane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process requiring a relatively high reaction 
temperature (> 773 K) to gain a high yield of butenes. Pt-based catalysts have been known as the best active components for the reaction. 
Monometallic Pt catalysts are active for butane dehydrogenation reaction, but deactivate drastically with time on stream, and their selectivity 
towards butenes is low. The main cause of the deactivation of the monometallic Pt catalysts is coke formation. The low selectivity results 
from cracking and isomerization reactions [1,4,5]. Adding Sn to the Pt catalysts improved the C4
= selectivity and stability of the monometallic

Pt catalysts by decreasing the cracking and isomerization products and the coke formation [1,6-9]. The addition of Sn to Pt can alter platinum 
structures by isolating the platinum particles into smaller ensembles [10-12]. These bimetallic particles reduce the coke formation by 
stabilizing the well-dispersed phase of the active component. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts can also modify the electronic nature or 
environment of the platinum atoms, which induces a decrease in the adsorption energy of precursors for coke formation [13-17].  
 
There are many authors reported on PtSn catalyst with various supports [2-7,9,12-15,18-21] and alkali promoted (Mg, Li, K and Na) 
[4,15,19,20] PtSn catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation reaction. Cortright et al. reported that the addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 
increased the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation by reducing the size of surface Pt ensembles [15]. The effect of K and Li addition on 
PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was also investigated for isobutane dehydrogenation [19]. They found that the presence of K and Li resulted in 
increases of the conversion and selectivity of isobutenes. A few researchers have studied n-butane dehydrogenation reaction using PtSn 
catalyst with different supports [22-27]. Bocanegra et al. reported bimetallic PtSn and trimetallic InPtSn catalysts with different supports (γ-
Al2O3, ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4) for n-butane dehydrogenation. The addition of In and/or Sn on Pt sites has geometric effects, and produces a 
dilution of the Pt surface, leading to the formation of alloys and/or intermetallic compounds to increase the catalytic activity [22-24]. Ballarini 
et al. have studied the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction with PtSn and PtGe supported on γ-Al2O3 deposited on sphere shaped α-Al2O3 by a 
wash coating method [25]. In their report, it was observed that the catalytic activity was improved by the addition of Sn on 0.5Pt and Ge on γ-
Al2O3/α-Al2O3 support. The increases of the catalytic activity mainly depend on the composition of Sn and Pt, which exhibit low electronic 
interaction in probable alloys [25,26]. Recently, the effect of copper on Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was investigated for n-butane

dehydrogenation [27]. The addition of Cu to Pt and Pd increased the conversion and improved the selectivity to n-butenes. The formation of 
PtCu or CuPtPd alloy with the addition of Cu led to an increase in the catalytic activity and stability.  
In the present study, a thermally stable sphere-shaped θ-Al2O3 support was used for the PtSn catalytic system. The (PtSn)1.5/θ-Al2O3 
catalyst was optimized for n-butane dehydrogenation with regard to the specific activity. XRD patterns and TEM images confirmed the 
presence of PtSn alloy on the prepared bimetallic PtSn catalysts. TPR analysis indicated that the reduction behaviors of Pt and Sn oxides 
differed considerably, depending on the Pt and Sn compositions. The scheme of PtSn alloy formation during the hydrogen reduction before 
the reaction was deduced from HAADF STEM analysis. The n-butane dehydrogenation was conducted at different temperatures (773-873 K), 
and the activity of the catalysts was explained by the characteristics of the catalysts in CO chemisorption, XRD, TPR, and XPS analysis. 
 
2. Experimental 
 
2.1. Preparation of the catalyst 
Monometallic Pt and Sn, and bimetallic PtSn/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with a series of metal loadings, were prepared by co-impregnation. 
The bimetallic catalysts were prepared using hydrogen hexachloroplatinate (IV) hydrate (Kojima Chemical Co., Ltd., > 99%) and tin chloride 
(Sigma-Aldrich, > 98%) salt as precursors. Weighed amounts of Pt and Sn salt (with an equivalent PtSn weigh ratio of 0.5 to 2) were placed in 
a 50-ml beaker and dissolved in a required quantity of ethanol. Sphere-shaped θ-Al2O3 support (~3 mm) was prepared by calcining the 
spherical γ-Al2O3 at 1273 K for 6 h. The θ-Al2O3 support was added into the beaker with Pt and Sn solution. Ethanol was removed by

evaporation on a hot plate, and the residue was dried at 393 K overnight and calcined at 773 K for 4 h in air. The monometallic 1.5 wt% Pt 
and Sn supported θ-Al2O3 catalyst were also prepared by the similar method. The prepared PtSn/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with different PtSn contents 
of 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 wt% were designated as (PtSn)0.5, (PtSn)1.0, (PtSn)1.5, and (PtSn)2.0, and the monometallic Pt and Sn catalyst were 
designated as Pt1.5 and Sn1.5.    
Pt1.5/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with different Sn concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 wt%) were also prepared to investigate the effects of Sn 
concentration, and were designated as Pt1.5Sn0.5, Pt1.5Sn1.0, (PtSn)1.5, and Pt1.5Sn2.0, respectively. 
 
2.2. Characterizations of catalysts 
The XRD patterns of the prepared PtSn/θ-Al2O3 catalysts were recorded on a diffractometer (M/S, Shimadzu Instruments, Japan) with 
Ni-filtered Cu Kα (λ = 0.15418 nm). The operating voltage was 40 kV, and the current was 30 mA, with a 2θ scanning rate of 2 °min-1. The 
BET surface areas and N2 adsorption-desorption measurements were performed at 77 K using an automated gas sorption system (Belsorp II 
mini, BEL Japan, Inc.,). The Barrett-Joyner-Halanda (BJH) method was used for the calculation of pore size distribution. The TPR 
experiments were carried out using a temperature program analyzer (BELCAT, BEL Japan, Inc.). For TPR studies, 0.1 g of a calcined sample 
was placed between quartz wool in a U-type quartz reactor. The sample was thermally treated under an Ar stream at 673 K for 2 h to remove 
physically adsorbed water and other impurities. The catalysts were cooled down to the room temperature under pure Ar gas. After the 
pretreatment, the catalysts were heated at 10 K min−1 from room temperature up to 1073 K in 5% H2/Ar stream with a flow rate of 30 mL

min−1. The chemisorptions of CO were performed with a pulse chemisorption mode (BELCAT, BEL Japan, Inc.). Prior to measurements, 0.05 
g of a sample was thermally treated under an He stream at 773 K for 50 min to remove physically adsorbed water and other impurities. The 
sample was cooled down to room temperature, and heated to 823 K with a heating rate of 10 K min−1 using pure H2 at a flow rate of 50 mL 
min−1. The sample was then reduced in a pure H2 flow at 823 K for 2 h. After the reduction at 823 K, the sample was purged with He gas at 
the same temperature for 1 h. After cooling to 323 K, the 10% CO/He gas was introduced for the CO chemisorption. CO loop gas was used 
for each pulse, and the pulse injections were repeated until saturation. The amount of CO was measured using a thermal conductivity detector. 
The metal dispersion of each catalyst was then calculated from the amount of CO adsorbed, taking the stoichiometry factor (SF) as one for 
CO/Ptatm: 
Dispersion (%) = 100 x Vs x SF x MW/(SW x Fn x 22414) 
where Vs is the cumulative volume of adsorbed CO (cm3 at STP), MW is the molecular weight of Pt metal (g mol-1), SW is the weight of the 
sample, and Fn is the Pt fraction in relation to the total catalyst sample weight.  
High-resolution TEM images of the Pt and Sn nano-particles were characterized by using FEI (Technai F20 G2, The Netherland) 
microscopy working in STEM mode (Accelerating voltage: 50 ~ 200 kV, Image resolution: < 0.23 nm, Electro probe size: < 0.3 nm, 
Magnification: 25 ~ 1,030,000X, Specimen double tilting: ± 40°/± 20°). The catalyst sample was dispersed in ethanol solution, and the 
suspension was carried out using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. The resulting solution was deposited on  copper grid coated with a carbon 
film, and the alcohol was evaporated. Finally, the sample containing the copper grid was used for the TEM and HRTEM/HAADF STEM

analysis. XPS analyses were performed using an Ulvac-PHI spectrometer (PHI 5000 VersaProbe; Minimum X-ray beam size: ≤ 10µm, energy 
resolution: ≤ 0.50 eV, sensitivity: ≥ 1,000,000 CPS, scanning electron gun (AES/SEM) and UV light source) utilizing a non-
monochromatized Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV). The vacuum in the analysis chamber was < 1 x 10−7 Pa. The Pt and Sn peaks were 
deconvoluted using a sum of Lorentzian–Gaussian functions. CHNS analysis was carried out using a Fisons EA1108 instrument for the 
determination of the amount of accumulated carbon on the surface of the catalyst after the reaction.  
 
2.3. Activity measurement  
The prepared catalysts were first crushed and sieved using testing sieve (wire material, S/STEEL, CHUNG GYE SANG GONG SA, 
Seoul, Republic of Korea). The final particle size was in the ranges of 180~435 μm before the activity test. The n-butane dehydrogenation was 
carried out at 823 K at atmospheric pressure using 0.1 g of the catalyst after the H2 reduction. The internal diameter of fixed bed tubular 
quartz reactor was 10 mm, and the catalyst bed length between the quartz wool layers in the reactor was approximately 3-4 mm. Before each 
experiment, the sample was reduced in a pure hydrogen flow (30 mL min−1). The temperature during the reduction was increased slowly from 
room temperature to 823 K (10 K min-1) and maintained at 823 K for 2 h. After the reduction, H2:N2:n-C4H10 feed gases with a molar ratio of 
1.0:1.0:1.0 to were introduced into the catalytic reactor for the reaction, and the total gas flow rate was kept constant at 30 mL min-1 (GHSV = 
18,000 h-1). The products and reactants were analyzed with an on-line GC (FID detector, Series M 600D, South Korea) equipped with a 
capillary column (GS-Alumina, Agilent Technologies, i.d.: 0.53 mm, length: 50 m).

3. Results and Discussion 
 
3.1. Catalyst characterization 
 
3.1.1. Physical properties of the catalysts 
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the reduced PtSn/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with different metal loadings. The 2θ values of Pt were at 39.76x, 
46.240.53, and 67.450.31 (ICDD file no.: 04-0802), and those of Sn were at 15.570.5, 16.35x, 22.100.2, 27.640.35, and 28.990.15 ((ICDD file no.: 19-
1365). No characteristic peaks of Pt/PtOx and Sn/SnOx were observed in the XRD patterns of the reduced PtSn/θ-Al2O3 catalysts. The reduced 
mono- and bimetallic PtSn/θ-Al2O3 catalysts showed θ-Al2O3 (ICDD file no.: 47-1771) and PtSn (ICDD file no.: 25-0614) phases with 2θ-
values at 25.080.6, 30.070.7 and 41.88x with hexagonal structure, which was evidence for the formation of PtSn alloy. The (PtSn)1.5 catalyst 
showed a very small PtSn peak, indicating that the dispersion of Pt was high, and that the particle size was small. This result was further 
confirmed by CO chemisorption and TEM analysis, as shown in Table 3. The XRD data of the calcined PtSn/θ-Al2O3 did also not produce any 
peaks related to Pt/PtO or Sn particles (Fig. S1, ESIψ)). Only θ-Al2O3 phases were indicated, with 2θ values of 31.050.4, 33.050.6, 37.150.4, 
39.520.3, 45.100.4, 48.000.1, 60.200.4, and 67.58x (ICDD file no.: 47-1771). This might be due to the high dispersion of Pt and Sn particles on the 
θ-Al2O3 support, and the sizes of Pt and Sn were too small to be detected by XRD techniques [28,29].

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the reduced bimetallic catalyst samples containing different amounts of Sn with Pt1.5 (Pt1.5Sn0.5, 
Pt1.5Sn1.0, (PtSn)1.5, and Pt1.5Sn2.0). The catalysts calcined at 873 K also showed θ-Al2O3 phases only (Fig. S2, ESIψ)). The reduced catalysts 
showed θ-Al2O3 and PtSn alloy phases, and consistently the peak intensity of the PtSn phase sample decreased with increasing Sn content. 
PtSn alloy composites were clearly identified using XRD in the reduced catalyst.  
Table 1 shows the physical properties (BET surface areas and XRD phases). The loading amounts of the prepared catalysts were 
analyzed using AAS/ICP analysis. The BET surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of θ-Al2O3 were 90 m2 g-1, 0.337 cm3 g-1, 
and 15 nm, respectively. The monometallic Pt1.5 catalyst showed similar BET surface areas on both calcined and reduced catalysts, but the 
BET surface area of the Sn1.5 sample decreased drastically after the reduction (from 82 to 75 m2 g-1). In bimetallic catalysts, the BET surface 
area decreased with an increase in metal loading, and the difference between the calcined and reduced catalysts was very small (Table 1). The 
pore volume (0.337-0.324 cm3 g-1) and the average pore diameter (15-16 nm) of the calcined sample also varied slightly after the reduction. 
The BET surface areas of the Pt1.5 catalysts (calcined and reduced) with different Sn content are also shown in Table 1. The BET surface area, 
pore volume, and pore diameter did not change much with increases in Sn content. 
 
 
3.1.2. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) studies 
Fig. 3 shows the TPR profiles of the Pt1.5, Sn1.5, and bimetallic catalysts with different PtSn loadings at a fixed Pt/Sn weight ratio of

1.0 on θ-Al2O3. Table 2 shows the reduction temperature, hydrogen consumption, and percentage of the reduction of mono- and bimetallic 
catalysts. All the TPR profiles were de-convoluted using Lorentzian-Gaussian functions. In the TPR profiles of the monometallic Pt1.5 catalyst 
(Fig. 3a), the low-temperature reduction peak at 500 K with a small shoulder at 446 K was assigned as the reduction of the Pt species in the 
weak interaction with the support. The other peak at 649 K was assigned to the reduction of the Pt species in the strong interaction with the 
support [24]. The reduction peaks at 780 and 829 K can be attributed to oxychlorinated Pt species, which originated after the impregnation of 
the support with chloroplatinic acid and the preparation method (drying and calcinations step) [25,30,31]. If the calcined Pt1.5 catalyst consists 
of PtO2 and PtO phases, the hydrogen consumption should be 0.038 and 0.077 mmol g cat-1, respectively. The hydrogen consumption of Pt1.5 
is 0.051 mmol g cat-1 in the TPR experiment. Therefore, the calcined Pt1.5 catalyst can be a mixed phase of PtO2 and PtO.  
In the case of Sn1.5 catalyst (Fig. 3b), a small reduction peak for a finely dispersed Sn species at 518 K appeared. The broad reduction 
peaks at 709 and 778 K could be due to the reduction of Sn4+/Sn2+ and/or Sn2+/Sn0 species, respectively [4,32]. The broad peak at 850 K can 
be assigned to the reduction of Sn2+ to Sn0 in a high interaction with the support [33,34]. If the calcined Sn1.5 is in the SnO or SnO2 phases, the 
hydrogen consumption of the calcined Sn1.5 sample would be 0.126 or 0.253 mmol g cat-1, respectively. The hydrogen consumption of the 
Sn1.5 is 0.143 mmol g cat-1. Therefore, the calcined Sn1.5 catalyst can be a mixed phase of SnO and SnO2. The TPR profiles of the Pt1.5 and 
Sn1.5 sample are overlapped in the temperature range up to 900 K, indicating that the Pt and Sn species can be co-reduced in this range. 
The TPR pattern of bimetallic (PtSn)0.5 catalyst (Fig. 3c) showed peaks at 590, 661, 771, 878, and 955 K. The reduction peaks of the 
(PtSn)0.5 catalyst appeared at a temperature higher than those of Pt1.5 and Sn1.5, which can be due to the high interaction of metal oxides and

support on the catalyst with the low Pt and Sn concentration. The peaks at 590 and 661 K (β peaks) can be assigned to the co-reduction of the 
Pt species with Sn species [25,35], which are mainly related to the reduction of the Pt species in the strong interaction with the support. The 
reduction peak at 771 and 878 K (γ peaks) can be assigned mainly to the reduction of Sn4+/Sn2+ and/or Sn2+/Sn0 species. The reduction peak at 
955 K (δ peak) can be attributed to the reduction of Sn2+/Sn0, as described previously regarding the reduction of the Sn1.5 sample. Similarly to 
the reduction of (PtSn)0.5, the reduction peaks of the (PtSn)1.0 appeared at 560, 657, 766, and 929 K. The peaks at 560 and 657 K can also be 
assigned to the β peaks, and the peaks at 766 K and 929 K can be assigned to the γ and δ peak, respectively. The reduction peaks of the 
(PtSn)1.5 appeared at 476, 548, 677, and 946 K. The new reduction peak at 476 K (α) can be assigned to the co-reduction of the Pt species 
with Sn species, which is related mainly to the Pt species in the weak interaction with the support. The peaks at 548, 677, and 946 K can be 
assigned to the β, γ, and δ peaks, respectively. The reduction peaks of the (PtSn)2.0 catalyst appeared at 515, 681, 773, and 863 K. The peak at 
515 K can be assigned to the α peak. On the other hand, the reduction profiles at 681, 773, and 863 K resemble those of the Sn1.5 sample. 
Therefore, the peaks at 681 and 773 K can be assigned to the γ peak, while that at 863 K can be assigned to the δ peak. 
Fig. 4 shows the TPR profiles and the hydrogen consumption of the Pt1.5Snx.x catalysts with different Sn content. The reduction peaks 
of the Pt1.5Sn0.5 catalyst were observed at 470 (α), 560 (β), 656 (γ), and 845 (δ) K. The temperature of the α and γ peaks slightly increased 
with an increase in Sn loading, while the temperature of the β peak was the lowest with the (PtSn)1.5. The hydrogen consumption of the α 
peak was similar to those of Pt1.5Sn0.5, Pt1.5Sn1.0, and Pt1.5Sn1.5, but it abruptly increased with Pt1.5Sn2.0. The Sn addition to the Pt1.5 catalyst 
increased the hydrogen consumption of mainly the γ peak.

Ballarini et al. [25] discussed that the peak that begins around 523-553 K could be due to the co-reduction of Pt and Sn or alloy 
formation. The peak at 698 K can be attributed to Sn oxidized species stabilized on the support in bimetallic PtSn catalysts [25,36]. Yu et al. 
reported that the low-temperature reduction peak in bimetallic PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was slightly shifted towards higher temperature than 
that of Pt/γ-Al2O3, which can lead to the formation of PtSn alloy [37]. However, it is plausible that the Pt and Sn species can be co-reduced at 
up to 900 K. The α position is assigned mainly to the reduction of the weak Pt species, the β position mainly to that of strong Pt species, and 
the γ position mainly to that of the Sn species. 
 
3.1.3. CO chemisorption 
Table 3 shows the metal surface areas (MSA), metal dispersions (D), and particle sizes (PS) of the Pt metal particles for the samples 
prepared by CO chemisorption. The mono metallic Pt1.5 catalyst had a very low dispersion and MSA, and larger particle size (>18 nm). The 
bimetallic (PtSn)0.5 and (PtSn)1.0 samples had similar dispersions and particle size (D = 4.90 and 4.95 %; PS = 23.1 and 22.8 nm). The metal 
surface area of (PtSn)1.0 catalyst was two times higher (0.11 m2 (g cat)-1) than that of (PtSn)0.5 catalyst. The (PtSn)1.5 sample had the highest 
dispersion among the prepared PtSn catalysts. However, the higher-loaded (PtSn)2.0 sample showed relatively low dispersion compared with 
the other bimetallic samples. 
The metal dispersion, metal surface area, and the mean particle size of the Pt1.5Snx.x catalysts with different amounts of Sn (Pt1.5Sn0.5, 
Pt1.5Sn1.0, (PtSn)1.5 and Pt1.5Sn2.0) are shown in Table 3. Both CO chemisorption and TEM analysis showed that the metal particle size 
Page 14 of 50

decreased with an increase in Sn content up to 1.5 wt.%. For the Pt1.5Sn2.0 catalyst, with a higher Sn load, the metal dispersion (6.1%) and 
metal surface area (0.211 mmol g cat-1) were low, and the particle size was about 18.5 nm. Vazquez-Zavala et al. compared the particle sizes 
of Pt1.0/Al2O3, Pt0.5Sn0.5/Al2O3, and Sn1.0/Al2O3 reduced at 673 K by TEM analysis [38]. The particle size of the Pt0.5Sn0.5 was the smallest. 
The metal particle size of the Pt1.5Sn1.5 catalyst was very small compared with that of Pt1.5 after the reduction at 823 K. It is plausible that the 
Pt metal particle migration can be retarded by the PtSn alloy formation during the reduction. 
 
3.1.4. HAADF STEM and EDX mapping 
The XRD pattern did not show any metal or metal oxides peaks (Pt/PtOx or Sn/SnOx) in the calcined catalysts, and only peaks of θ-
Al2O3 phase were observed. To identify the structures of the Pt, Sn, and PtSn particles on θ-Al2O3, the (PtSn)1.5 sample was characterized 
using a FEI microscopy in STEM mode. Figs. 5 (a) and (b) show typical high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF STEM) 
images and the corresponding EDS maps of the calcined and reduced (PtSn)1.5 catalysts, respectively. Fig. 5(a) shows the HAADF STEM-
EDS compositional maps of the calcined (PtSn)1.5 catalyst. The distribution of the Pt and Sn particles was clearly visible. The Pt particles were 
scattered on the support, while the Sn particles were uniformly well distributed, as shown in the EDS mapping. Fig. 5(b) also shows the 
HAADF STEM-EDS compositional maps of the reduced (PtSn)1.5 catalyst. The distributions of Pt and Sn particles were also visible. Both Pt 
and Sn particles were observed at the same position on the reduced (PtSn)1.5 catalyst. The Pt particle numbers of the calcined (PtSn)1.5 sample 
decreased after the reduction, indicating the Pt particles were sintered. However, the highly dispersed Sn particles on the calcined (PtSn)1.5

sample migrated to the Pt particles during the reduction. The observation of the Pt and Sn particles on the same position suggests the 
formation of PtSn alloy during the reduction.  
 
3.1.5. HRTEM and FFT 
The supplementary material (Fig S3, ESIψ) shows TEM images and the particle size distribution of the reduced PtSn/θ-Al2O3 catalysts 
with the various PtSn loadings (Fig S3, ESIψ). The TEM images of the reduced (PtSn)0.5, (PtSn)1.0, (PtSn)1.5, and (PtSn)2.0 catalysts show that 
the Pt particle sizes were about 9.7, 10.6, 7.1, and 22.5 nm. The particles size of the (PtSn)1.5 catalyst was smallest among the prepared 
catalysts, which supports the CO chemisorption results. The average Pt particle size according to TEM analysis was approximately half that in 
the chemisorption data (Table 3). A conventional CO/Ptatm of 1.0 was used for the Pt particle size calculation. In the supported Pt/Al2O3 
catalysts, the CO/H ratio for a Pt atom was estimated as 0.83-0.96 [39]. In the well-dispersed catalysts, a CO/H ratio of 0.7 was reported for 
an H/Pt ratio of 1.0, which was due to the CO bridged bonding of 50% on Pt [40]. Here, the metal particle size of the Pt on the bimetallic 
catalysts determined by TEM analysis will be equivalent to that by CO chemisorption, if the CO/Pt ratio is 0.5.  
The supplementary material (Fig S4, ESIψ) shows the TEM images and particle size distribution of the Pt1.5Snx.x catalysts with 
different amounts of Sn. The TEM images of the reduced Pt1.5, Pt1.5Sn0.5, Pt1.5Sn1.0, (PtSn)1.5, and Pt1.5Sn2.0 catalysts show that the Pt particle 
sizes were about 18.6, 10.6, 9.8, 7.1, and 8.5 nm, respectively. The particle sizes decreased with increasing Sn loading up to the 1.5 wt.% Sn 
content, as shown in Table 3. Further Sn addition to the (PtSn)1.5 catalyst increased the particle size. As shown in the TPR results, all the Pt

and Sn can be co-reduced in the reduction at 823 K. The HAADF STEM-EDS study showed that the Sn species migrate to the Pt particles, 
resulting in bimetallic PtSn particles and PtSn alloy during the reduction. It is possible that the bimetallic PtSn and PtSn alloy could retard the 
sintering of the Pt particles. 
Fig. 6 shows the HRTEM micrograph of the calcined and reduced (PtSn)1.5 catalyst, indicating the presence of individual particles 
with clear lattice fringes. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) was applied to calculate the lattice spacing of the crystallite. The FFT image (Fig. 
6(a)) of the calcined (PtSn)1.5 catalyst exhibits lattice spacings of 0.226 and 0.196 nm, corresponding to the (111) and (200) reflection planes 
of the Pt, respectively. The FFT images of the reduced (PtSn)1.5 catalyst (Fig. 6(b)) showed a spacing of 0.306 nm, corresponding to the (101) 
planes of the PtSn alloy.  
 
3.1.6. X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) 
The calcined and reduced bimetallic PtSn catalysts were characterized by XPS to obtain the information about the Pt and Sn valence 
state and the chemical composition of the sample surface. The XPS data for Sn and Pt species were reported by Hoang et.al [32]. The BEs of 
Pt(4f5/2) at 74.5, 75.7, and 78.2 eV indicate the presence of Pt0, PtO, and PtO2 [41]. Those of both the calcined and reduced PtSn catalysts 
were shown at 74.4-74.6 eV, which were associated with Pt0 and/or the Al support. The small shoulder peaks on the calcined samples were 
observed at 75.5-75.9 eV (Fig. S5 and S6, ESIψ), which may suggest the presence of a Pt2+ state [32]. Nonetheless, the BEs at 74.5 and 75.7 
eV, characterized by the Pt(4f5/2) peak, were closely overlapped with the Al support. Therefore, it is not reliable to identify the Pt valence state

on alumina-supported PtSn catalysts by XPS.  
Fig. 7 shows the XP spectra of the Sn(3d) core level on the Pt1.5, Sn1.5, and bimetallic catalysts with different PtSn loadings at a fixed 
Pt/Sn weight ratio of 1.0 on θ-Al2O3. Table 4 summarized the BEs, percentages of Sn0, and ratio of Sn2+/Sn4+ for Sn(3d5/2) of all the prepared 
catalysts. In Fig. 7, the BEs at 486.2-487.1 eV for Sn(3d5/2) on the calcined mono- and bimetallic catalysts were assigned as Sn2+ and/or Sn4+ 
states [42]. Angel et al. concluded that the BEs at 485.2-486.5 eV could be assigned as Sn0 or in the SnPtx state, and that the BEs at 487.2-
488.3 eV could be ascribed to an oxidized tin species such as Sn4+/Sn2+ [43,44].  
The reduced monometallic Sn1.5 sample shows BEs at 485.2 (72%) and 487.2 eV (28%), which can be ascribed to Sn0 and Sn2+/Sn4+, 
respectively [32,43]. It was clearly shown in TPR experiments that all the Sn species could be reduced after the reduction at 823 K for 2 h. 
The BEs at 485.1-485.5 eV on the reduced bimetallic catalysts can be ascribed as Sn0 and/or SnPtx states with percentages of 68-78%. The 
concentration of the Sn0 and/or SnPtx state increased with an increase in PtSn loading, as shown in Table 4. The BEs at 486.5-486.1 eV can be 
ascribed to an oxidized Sn4+/Sn2+ state with percentages of 22-34%. The Sn4+ and Sn2+ cannot be discriminated, because their BEs almost 
coincided [43,45]. The Sn oxide phase in the XPS of the reduced samples can be ascribed mainly to the Sn species of the δ peak in the TPR 
profile. The surface analysis shows that the surface concentration (between 68 and 78%) of Sn0 and/or SnPtx in bimetallic catalysts was higher 
than in the monometallic sample, indicating that the reducibility of Sn in PtSn catalysts was high, as shown in Table 4 [22].  
Fig. 8 shows the valence state and the chemical composition of the Sn(3d5/2) core level on the calcined and reduced Pt1.5Snx.x catalysts 
with different Sn content. The calcined catalysts show BEs of the Sn(3d5/2) at 486.1-486.4 eV, which can be assigned to Sn2+ and/or Sn4+

species, while those of the reduced catalysts show values at 485.1-485.3 eV and 486.6-486.7 eV. As discussed previously [32,42-44], the first 
peak at 485.1-485.3 eV on the reduced catalysts can be assigned as Sn0 or SnPtx alloy state as a percentage of 59-80%. The higher BEs 
(486.6- 486.7 eV) can be ascribed to oxidized Sn4+/Sn2+ as a percentage of 23-41%, as shown in Table 4.  
The experimental results of XRD, HRTEM and FFT analysis strongly confirmed the presence of PtSn bimetals or PtSn alloys in the 
reduced catalysts. TPR analysis showed that a part of the Sn oxides was not reduced in the reduction conditions for the reaction. The XPS 
analysis showed that the content of Sn0 or SnPtx alloy on the surface was in the range of 59 to 80%, which supports the TPR analysis. The 
HAADF STEM images and EDS maps of the calcined (PtSn)1.5 catalyst showed that relatively large Pt particles are scattered on the support, 
while Sn particles with very small sizes were well distributed all over the surface. The HAADF STEM images/EDS maps of the reduced 
(PtSn)1.5 catalyst confirmed that the surface Sn species were in the same position as the Pt species, indicating that the reduced Pt and Sn can 
be in the bimetallic or alloy state. In the TPR analysis of the (PtSn)1.5 catalyst, the weakly bonded Pt was co-reduced with the Sn at around 
476 K (α peak), the strongly bonded Pt was co-reduced at 548 K (β peak), and the Sn species was reduced at 677 K (γ peak). Part of the 
strongly bonded isolated Sn species remained in an unreduced state under the reduction conditions for the reaction at 823 K for 2 h. In the 
HAADF STEM images and EDS maps, the Pt oxides were co-reduced with the dispersed Sn oxides in the vicinity of Pt, and then, the distant 
Sn metals migrated to the reduced Pt particles, resulting in PtSn alloys or PtSn bimetallic particles, which is schematically depicted in scheme

3.2. Catalytic activity 
 
3.2.1. Effect of Pt-Sn loadings on θ-Al2O3  
Fig. 9 shows the conversion of n-butane with respect to the reaction time on the Pt1.5, Sn1.5, and bimetallic catalysts with different 
PtSn loadings at a fixed Pt/Sn weight ratio of 1.0 on θ-Al2O3. The reaction was carried out at 823 K for 5 h in n-butane dehydrogenation. The 
monometallic Pt1.5 and Sn1.5 catalyst showed very low conversion with time on stream. The initial conversions of Pt1.5, (PtSn)0.5, (PtSn)1.0, 
(PtSn)1.5, and (PtSn)2.0 catalyst were 24.1, 39.4, 45.8, 46.7, and 45.4%, respectively. The conversions of each catalyst after 5 hours decreased 
to 15.4, 28, 40.8, 43.6, and 39%, respectively. The conversion of the (PtSn)1.5 catalyst was not only the highest among the prepared catalysts, 
but also the most stable. The catalysts listed in order of both the conversion of n-butane and the stability are (PtSn)1.5 > (PtSn)1.0 > (PtSn)2.0 > 
(PtSn)0.5 > Pt1.5. The activity of the prepared catalysts was closely related to the Pt metal surface area. 
Table 5 shows the initial and final conversion (Xi and Xf, measured at 30 to 300 min time on stream), n-C4
= selectivity, and n-C4
= 
yield of the Pt, Sn, and PtSn catalysts. In the product distribution, 1,3-butadiene was produced by the dehydrogenation of n-butenes produced 
during n-butane dehydrogenation. The selectivity to 1,3-butandiene was limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium in the reaction condition. 
The products of C1~C3 included methane, ethane, propane, and propylene, which could be produced on the hydrocracking sites on Pt catalysts.

However, the selectivity to C1~C3 on the PtSn bimetallic catalysts was low compared with that of the Pt1.5 catalyst, indicating that the 
hydrocracking sites were blocked by Sn addition. The selectivity to C1~C3 of each bimetallic PtSn catalysts with the Pt/Sn weight ratio of 1.0 
was almost the same, irrespective of the PtSn loading. At 18%, the initial i-C4
 selectivity of the (PtSn)1.5 catalyst was high, but rapidly 
decreased to 8%, resulting in the highest n-C4
= yield. The i-C4 selectivity can be related to high conversion and the high Sn character. The 
ratio of 2-butene/1-butene is not determined by a kinetic factor, but by the thermodynamic equilibrium.  
The deactivation parameters of mono- and bimetallic catalysts are shown in Table 5 (ΔX = 100×(Xi-Xf)/Xi, where Xi is the initial and 
Xf is the final conversion, respectively). The monometallic Pt1.5 was strongly deactivated with time on steam, as expected. Pt1.5 catalyst 
showed very low metal dispersion (2.7%) and metal surface area (0.09 m2 g cat-1), and a large Pt particle size (>18.6 nm). The coke formation 
after the reaction was 3.1 wt%, which was higher than that of the bimetallic catalysts. In bimetallic catalysts, the n-C4
= yield increased with an 
increase in PtSn loading up to (PtSn)1.5. The bimetallic (PtSn)1.5 catalyst was the most stable with time on stream at 823 K for 5 h 
(deactivation parameter = 6.6). This might have been due to the high metal dispersion (7.5%) and metal surface area (0.24 m2 g cat-1) of the 
PtSn bimetallic particles, and small particles of Pt (< 8.0 nm) were observed in CO chemisorption and TEM (Table 3). Veldurthi et al. 
reported that the improvement of catalytic activity was mainly related to the metal dispersion, metal surface area, and particle size of the 
catalysts [27]. The Sn0 was slightly shifted towards a higher binding energy, which was assigned as Sn in PtSn alloy, and provided evidence 
of catalytic activity [32,43]. Also, the lower reduction peak slightly shifted towards a higher temperature than with the monometallic Pt1.5 
catalyst with probable PtSn alloy formation. The PtSn composites were clearly observed in HAADF STEM and corresponding EDS mapping

(Fig 5(b)). Several have noted a relationship between the particle size of the active metal and the amount of carbon deposited on the surface of 
the support [24,33,46]. The catalysts with highly dispersed Pt particles may activate the butane dehydrogenation effectively. However, the 
(PtSn)2.0 catalyst showed a lower C4
= yield and a higher deactivation parameter than the (PtSn)1.5 (Table 5). This could have been due to the 
larger particles of Pt and/or PtSn, as confirmed by XRD, CO chemisorption, and TEM. The (PtSn)2.0 catalyst showed more coke formation 
after the reaction at 823 K, which blocked the active sites. The coke formation on the catalyst involves several processes, such as 
dehydrogenation condensation, polymerization, and cyclization of hydrocarbon species on the catalyst surface. It was known that the olefinic 
precursors formed on the metal active sites migrated to the support, and were converted to polyolefinic or polyaromatic types of coke through 
condensation and polymerization reaction [1,44,45,47-50]. The improvement of n-C4
= yield in bimetallic catalysts could have been due to the 
electronic or geometric effects of PtSn alloy particles. The alloy particles restrict the sites for cracking, hydrogenolysis, and isomerization, 
resulting in high n-C4
= selectivity and resistance to the coke formation [22-24].  
 
3.2.2. Effect of reaction temperature 
Fig. 10 shows the butane conversion of (PtSn)1.5 catalyst with respect to the time on stream in the range of 773-873 K, and Table 6 
shows the deactivation parameter, butane conversion, n-C4
= selectivity, and n-C4
= yield. The deactivation parameter increased with an increase 
in the reaction temperature. The cracking products of C1~C3 also increased with an increase in the reaction temperature, resulting in the low 
C4
= selectivity. Higher reaction temperature resulted in higher 1,3-butadiene yield at the thermodynamic point. The reaction at 848 K showed

the highest C4
= yield after 5 h on stream.  
Fig. 11 shows the time-dependent catalytic activity (conversion and selectivity) of the calcined (PtSn)1.5 catalyst. The reaction was 
carried out at 823 K for 15 h. This catalyst was slightly deactivated with time on stream. The initial and final conversions were 46.7 and 
38.6%, respectively, and the deactivation parameter was 17.3 over an operation period of 15 h. The initial selectivities of 1-butene and 2-
butene were 31 and 46 %, respectively, and the n-C4
= selectivity increased with the reaction time up to 7 h, after which it was stabilized. The 
final selectivities of 1-butene and 2-butene were 36 and 54%, respectively, and the n-C4
= yield was 35% after 15 h at 823 K.  
  
3.2.3. Effect of Sn content on 1.5wt.%Pt/θ-Al2O3 
Fig 12 shows the butane conversion with respect to the reaction time on the reduced Pt1.5Snx.x catalysts with different Sn content. The 
conversion of n-butane increased with the Sn loading up to 1.5 wt.%. The conversion was drastically decreased on the Pt1.5Sn2.0 catalyst. Table 
7 shows the butane conversion, n-C4
= selectivity and yields, and deactivation parameters. The (PtSn)1.5 catalyst showed the lowest deactivation 
parameter and the highest n-C4
= yield, and the coke deposition was negligible compared with the Pt1.5Sn0.5, Pt1.5Sn1.0, and Pt1.5Sn2.0 catalysts. 
The Pt1.5Sn0.5 and Pt1.5Sn1.0 catalysts showed particle sizes of about ~10 nm, as shown in Table 3. The coke formations of the Pt1.5Sn0.5 and 
Pt1.5Sn1.0 catalysts were about 4.2 and 3.5%, respectively. Further increases in the Sn concentration (Pt1.5Sn2.0) caused a decrease in the 
activity of the catalysts. As discussed previously, the particle sizes decreased with increases in Sn loading up to 1.5 wt% Sn, as shown in 
Table 3, which suggested that the sintering of Pt particles could be retarded by the PtSn alloy formation. Vazquez-Zavala et al. showed the Pt

core and Sn shell structure of Pt0.2Sn0.8 on SiO2 support [38], indicating that Pt particles can be encapsulated with Sn in a PtSn bimetallic 
catalyst with high Sn content. Then, the PtSn particle size increased. At that point, it can be suggested that Sn started to encapsulate the Pt 
particles, when Sn was added to Pt with a Sn/Pt weight ratio higher than 1.0. The encapsulation of Pt by Sn can occur with Pt1.5Sn2.0, resulting 
in an increase of the PtSn particle size. Therefore, the (PtSn)1.5 catalyst had the smallest particle size among the prepared catalysts, showing 
the highest activity for n-butane dehydrogenation. 
The catalysts listed in order of apparent specific metal surface area are (PtSn)1.5 > Pt1.5Sn2.0 > Pt1.5Sn1.0 > Pt1.5Sn0.5 > (PtSn)1.0 > 
(PtSn)2.0 > Pt1.5 > (PtSn)0.5 . At up to 1.5 wt% Pt loading, the apparent metal surface area increased with increases in Pt metal loading. Further 
Pt loading resulted in the decrease of metal surface area. The catalysts listed in order of increasing metal particle size according to TEM 
analysis are (PtSn)1.5 > Pt1.5Sn2.0 > (PtSn)0.5 > Pt1.5Sn1.0 > Pt1.5Sn0.5 > (PtSn)1.0 > Pt1.5 > (PtSn)2.0. The catalysts in order of n-C4
= yield are 
(PtSn)1.5 > (PtSn)1.0 > Pt1.5Sn1.0 > (PtSn)2.0 > Pt1.5Sn0.5 > Pt1.5Sn2.0 > (PtSn)0.5 > Pt1.5. It is clear that one property cannot be a dominant factor in 
the n-butane dehydrogenation. The Pt/Sn composition and apparent metal surface area are important for n-butane dehydrogenation. XRD, 
TEM, and TRP analyses showed that the resulting PtSn alloy could be controlled by the Pt/Sn composition. The apparent metal surface area of 
the PtSn bimetallic catalyst is dependent only on the Pt loading up to 1.5 wt%. The Pt/Sn weight ratio of 1.0 on catalysts with the same Pt 
loading showed the best activity for n-butane dehydrogenation. As a result, the (PtSn)1.5 catalyst with the highest metal surface area and the 
Pt/Sn weight ratio of 1.0 showed the highest activity.

4. Conclusions 
A stable and selective PtSn/θ-Al2O3 catalyst has been prepared for n-butane dehydrogenation. The bimetallic catalysts showed better 
n-C4
= yield than the monometallic catalysts supported on θ-Al2O3. The catalysts were reduced at 823 K for 2 h before the reaction. TPR 
analysis showed that Pt and Sn could be co-reduced under the reduction conditions at 823 K. TEM and XRD studies indicated PtSn alloy 
formation during the reduction. HAADF STEM images/EDS maps suggested the reduction procedure of the Pt and Sn species. The scattered 
Pt oxides in the vicinity of the well-dispersed Sn oxides were co-reduced, and then the reduced Sn metals migrated to the PtSn particles, 
resulting in the formation of PtSn alloy. The n-butane dehydrogenation reaction was studied systematically in the temperature range of 773-
873 K. The best catalytic performance was observed with the (PtSn)1.5 catalyst. The (PtSn)1.5 showed the highest apparent metal surface area. 
The activity of the (PtSn)1.0 catalyst showed higher activity than that of the Pt1.5Snx.x bimetallic catalysts (x.x= 0.5, 1.0, 2.0), although the 
apparent surface area of the (PtSn)1.0 catalyst was half that of the Pt1.5Snx.x bimetallic catalysts. In those experiments, higher n-C4
= yield 
corresponded to a higher apparent metal surface area of the PtSn bimetallic catalyst with a Pt/Sn ratio of 1.0. 
We monitored how PtSn formed during the reduction step by HAADF STEM and corresponding EDS mapping. The detailed reduction 
processes were observed by TPR. The characterizations of Pt catalysts were correlated with the catalytic activity for n-butane 
dehydrogenation.

Highlights  
 
 Addition Sn on Pt/θ-Al2O3 improves the C4
= yield and reduces the deactivation rate.  
 Migration of Sn species to Pt particles resulted in a formation of PtSn alloy.  
 
 PtSn alloy increases the n-C4
= selectivity by blocking the cracking and hydrogenolysis sites of the Pt catalyst. 
 
 The (PtSn)1.5 catalyst was optimized for n-butane dehydrogenation reaction.
