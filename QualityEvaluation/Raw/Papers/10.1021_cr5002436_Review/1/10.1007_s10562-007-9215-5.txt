Abstract
PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3–Na catalysts dis-
play important modiﬁcations of the metallic phase with
respect to Pt/Al2O3 one. In this sense, TPR and XPS results
show the presence of strong interactions between Pt and
Sn, with probable alloy formation, which would be
responsible for the decrease of the reaction rate and the
increase of the activation energy in cyclohexane dehydro-
genation.
Besides
the
experiments
of
cyclopentane
hydrogenolysis show that the alkali metal addition to
bimetallic PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts completely eliminates the
hydrogenolytic ensembles, which could be due to a geo-
metric modiﬁcation of the metallic phase. These important
modiﬁcations in the nature of the metallic function due to
the simultaneous addition of Na and Sn to Pt/Al2O3 are
responsible for the excellent catalytic performance in the
n-butane dehydrogenation, thus giving high conversions,
selectivities to butenes higher than 95%, and lower deac-
tivation capacity than those corresponding to bimetallic
PtSn catalysts (with different Sn contents) supported on
undoped alumina. The excellent stability of PtSn/Al2O3–
Na catalysts would be due to a low carbon formation
during the reaction, such as it was observed from pulse
experiments.

Characterization of supported metallic catalysts
1 Introduction
Bimetallic catalysts supported on alumina are active for
naphtha reforming and dehydrogenation of parafﬁns of
both low and high molecular weight. [1–6]. One important
difference between naphtha reforming and dehydrogena-
tion catalysts is related to their acidic character. Thus, for
the reforming of hydrocarbons it is required a given acidity
level to obtain an adequate balance between the metallic
and the acidic function, which gives the bifunctional
character [7]. In the case of the dehydrogenation catalysts,
the side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymeri-
zation), which are catalyzed by acidic centers, should be
inhibited and thus the yield to the corresponding oleﬁns
increases. In order to minimize the undesirable side reac-
tions, the acidic sites of the support can be poisoned by the
addition of alkali metal ions during the preparation of the
catalysts. It must be indicated that several studies on this
topic have been reported in the literature. Thus, Pines and
Haag [8] found that alkali metal ions poison the Lewis
acidic sites of the alumina. Jiratova
´ and Beranek [9]
reported a selective poisoning of the support when alumina
is doped with Na ions. Garcı
´a Cortez et al. [10] and
Bocanegra et al. [11], found that Li, Na and K ions poison
the acidic sites of alumina. Moreover, these authors
reported that the strong acidic sites are poisoned by the
addition of small quantities of alkali metal ions. Further
addition of these ions appears to block centers with lower
acidic strength. Likewise, it was also found [10] that the
toxicity of the alkali metals on the acidic character of

alumina increases with the ionic radius, though the poi-
soning effect of Na, K and Li would not be related only to a
steric effect. Besides, de Miguel et al. [12] found, through
FTIR of pre-adsorbed CO and NMR measurements, that K
and Li are selectively adsorbed on tetrahedrally coordi-
nated Lewis Al3+ sites of the alumina surface, this effect
being more pronounced for K. However, the addition of
alkali metals to alumina not only modiﬁes the acidic
function, but also it affects the structure of the metallic
phase. In fact, Mross [13] reported that the alkali metals
could change the electronic structure of the transition
metals and, in consequence, the activity in the CO hydro-
genation reaction is enhanced. Park and Price [14, 15]
reported that K addition to Pd/Al2O3 catalyst increases both
the activity and the selectivity in the acetylene hydroge-
nation. This behavior was explained in terms of the
increase of the support basicity, and an electronic trans-
ference from K to Pd. Rodrı
´guez et al. [16] reported that
the addition of potassium to Pt–Sn/SiO2 did not change the
activity of the fresh catalysts in the isobutane dehydroge-
nation reaction, but it improved the dehydrogenation
selectivity, which reached values of almost 100%. Besides,
Vernoux et al. [17] found for the selective catalytic
reduction (SCR) of NOx by propene and propane under
lean-burn conditions, that the addition of Na markedly
modiﬁed the Pt catalytic behavior.
In this paper, a complete characterization of both acidic
and metallic phases of PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and PtSn/Al2O3–
Na catalysts is carried out by using isopropanol dehydration,
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Temperature
Programmed Reduction (TPR) and test reactions of the
metallic phase. Besides the inﬂuence of the Na addition to
PtSn/Al2O3 on the activity, selectivity and deactivation (by
coke formation) in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction is
analyzed by using ﬂow and pulse reactors.
2 Experimental
Catalysts were prepared by using a commercial c-Al2O3
(CK-300 from Cyanamid Ketjen, SBET = 180 m2 g–1) pre-
viously calcined in ﬂowing air at 650 C for 3 h. The
alumina samples doped with Na in different concentrations
(0.05,0.15, 0.25 and 0.5 wt%) were obtained by impreg-
nating the support with an aqueous solution of NaOH,
using a volume of solution/weight of support ratio of
1.4 mL g–1 and a NaOH concentration such as to obtain the
desired
Na
loading
on
the
support.
PtSn/Al2O3–Na
(0.5 wt%) catalysts were prepared by an initial impregna-
tion with NaOH. Then, Pt and Sn were incorporated either
by successive impregnation or coimpregnation. In the ﬁrst
case, Pt was deposited from an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6
(0.011 M), dried at 120 C for 12 h, and then the samples
were impregnated with a hydrochloric solution of SnCl2. In
the case of coimpregnation, both metallic precursors were
simultaneously added to the impregnating solution. The
impregnation volume/support weight ratio was 1.4 mL g–1
in all cases. After the impregnation, samples were dried at
120 C. The metallic contents were 0.3 wt% for Pt, and 0.3
or 0.5 wt% for Sn. After impregnation, samples were dried
at 120 C and ﬁnally calcined at 500 C in ﬂowing air for
3 h. Moreover, the monometallic Pt (0.3 wt%)/Al2O3 cat-
alyst was prepared by alumina impregnation with an
aqueous solution of H2PtCl6.
The acidic properties of pure and Na-doped alumina
samples were determined by isopropanol (IPA) dehydra-
tion reaction at 250 C and atmospheric pressure in a ﬂow
reactor, using a H2/IPA molar ratio of 18 and a space
velocity of 32 h–1.
The textural properties of Al2O3 and Al2O3–Na were
determined in a Quantachrome Corporation NOVA 1000
surface area analyzer. It was observed that the speciﬁc
textural properties (speciﬁc surface area and pore size
distribution) of the support are practically unmodiﬁed by
the alkali metal addition between 0 and 0.5 wt% Na.
Two different n-butane dehydrogenation tests were
carried out, one of them in a continuous ﬂow reactor and
the other one in a pulse equipment. The continuous ﬂow
experiments were performed at 530 C for 2 h in a quartz
ﬂow reactor heated by an electric furnace. The reactor
(with
a
catalyst
weight
of
0.200 g)
was
fed
with
18 mL min–1 of the reactive mixture (n-butane + hydro-
gen, H2/n-C4H10 molar ratio = 1.25). The reactive mixture
was prepared ‘‘in situ’’ by using mass ﬂow controllers.
All gases, n-butane, N2 (used for purge), and H2 (used for
the previous reduction of catalysts and for the reaction)
were high purity ones (>99.99%). Prior to the reaction,
catalysts were reduced ‘‘in situ’’ at 530 C under ﬂowing
H2 for 3 h. The reactor efﬂuent was analyzed in a GC-
FID equipment with a packed chromatographic column
(1/8’’ OD · 6 m, 20% BMEA on Chromosorb P-AW 60/
80). The column was kept at 50 C during the analysis
and in this way, the amounts of methane, ethane, ethyl-
ene, propane, propylene, n-butane, 1-butene, cis–2-butene,
trans-2-butene and 1,3 butadiene were measured. The n-
butane conversion was calculated as the sum of the per-
centages of the chromatographic areas of the reaction
products (except H2) corrected by the corresponding
response factor. The selectivity to the different reaction
products was deﬁned as the ratio: mol of product i/R mol
of all products (except H2). Taking into account the high
temperatures used for the reaction (for thermodynamic
reasons), it was necessary to determine the contribution of
the homogeneous reaction. For this purpose, a blank
experiment was performed by using a quartz bed and the
results showed a negligible n-butane conversion (<<1%).

Pulse experiments were performed in order to determine
the behavior of catalysts in the ﬁrst steps of the reaction
since the initial catalytic properties cannot be determined in
ﬂow experiments. These experiments were carried out by
injecting pulses of pure n-butane (0.5 mL STP) into the
catalytic bed (0.100 g of sample) at 530 C. The catalytic
bed was kept under ﬂowing He (30 mL min–1) between the
injection of two successive pulses. Prior to the experiments,
all samples were reduced ‘‘in situ’’ under ﬂowing H2 at
530 C for 3 h. The composition of each pulse after the
reaction was determined by using a GC-FID equipment
with a packed column (Porapack Q). The temperature of the
chromatographic column was 30 C. In these experiments
the n-butane conversion was calculated as the difference
between the chromatographic area of n-butane fed to the
reactor (previously determined) and the chromatographic
area of non-reacted n-butane at the outlet of the reactor, and
this difference was referred to the chromatographic area of
n-butane fed to the reactor. The selectivity to a given
product was calculated in the same way as for ﬂow exper-
iments. The carbon amount retained by the catalyst after the
injection of each pulse was calculated through a mass bal-
ance between the total carbon amount fed to the reactor and
the total carbon amount detected by the chromatographic
analysis at the outlet of the reactor. The accumulative car-
bon retention was calculated as the sum of the carbon
amount retained after each pulse.
The characteristics of the metallic catalysts were deter-
mined by different techniques: test reactions of the metallic
phase (cyclohexane dehydrogenation and cyclopentane
hydrogenolysis), temperature programmed reduction (TPR)
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
Test reactions of the metallic phase were performed in a
differential ﬂow reactor at atmospheric pressure. Cyclo-
hexane (CH) dehydrogenation was carried out at 300 C, by
using a H2/CH molar ratio of 29 and a CH ﬂow rate of
6 mL h–1. Prior to the reaction, catalysts were reduced at
500 C. The activation energy in CH dehydrogenation for
different catalysts was obtained by measuring the initial
reaction rate at 270, 285 and 300 C. Cyclopentane (CP)
hydrogenolysis was done at 300 C, H2/CP molar ratio = 25
and volumetric CP ﬂow = 6 mL h–1. Prior to this reaction,
catalysts were reduced at 500 C. The sample weight used in
these experiments was the appropriate to obtain a CH or CP
conversion lower than 7%. The reaction products were only
benzene and n-pentane for the ﬁrst and second reaction,
respectively. In both cases, the reaction products were ana-
lyzed by using a gas chromatographic system (packed col-
umn with Chromosorb and FID detector).
TPR experiments were performed in a quartz ﬂow
reactor. The samples were heated at 6 C min–1 from room
temperature up to 800 C. The reductive mixture (5% v/v
H2–N2) was fed to the reactor with a ﬂow rate of 10 mL
min–1. Catalysts were previously calcined ‘‘in situ’’ at
500 C for 3 h.
XPS measurements were carried out in a VG-Microtech
Multilab spectrometer, which operates with an energy
power of 50 eV (radiation MgKa, hm = 1253.6 eV). The
pressure of the analysis chamber was kept at 4 · 1010 torr.
Samples were previously reduced ‘‘in situ’’ at 500 C with
H2 for 2 h. Binding energies (BE) were referred to the C1s
peak at 284.9 eV. The peak areas were determined by ﬁt-
ting the experimental results with Lorentzian–Gaussian
curves.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Isopropanol Dehydration
The poisoning effect of the Na addition on the acidic
properties of the alumina was studied by means of the
dehydration of isopropanol (IPA) to propylene (P) and
di-isopropylether (E). Table 1 shows that the isopropanol
conversion decreases as the amount of Na increases. It can
also be observed that very low amounts of Na (0.25 wt%)
added to Al2O3 produce a strong inhibition of the dehy-
drating capacity, the activity being null for 0.5 wt% Na.
The selectivity to di-isopropylether displays an analogous
behavior since it decreases with the increase of the Na
content, such as Table 1 shows. Taking into account that
the ether formation would require strong acidic sites [10],
the results obtained in the isopropanol dehydration would
be in agreement with the high poisoning capacity of Na on
the stronger acidic sites of the alumina. By considering
these results, a Na content of 0.5 wt% was used for the
preparation of the different Pt/Al2O3–Na and PtSn/Al2O3–
Na catalysts.
3.2 CH Dehydrogenation and CP Hydrogenolysis
Both test reactions of the metallic phase (CH dehydroge-
nation and CP hydrogenolysis) were carried out at 300 C
and the results are displayed in Table 2. This Table shows

propylether (E) (conversion to di-isopropylether · 100/conversion to

the initial reaction rates (RCH) and the activation energy
values (ECH) for CH dehydrogenation, and the initial
reaction rates (RCP) for CP hydrogenolysis. Besides,
Table 2 displays a catalytic comparison between the
behavior of bimetallic PtSn and monometallic Pt catalysts
supported on Al2O3 and Al2O3–Na.
For CH dehydrogenation, a structure-insensitive reac-
tion [18], bimetallic PtSn catalysts show a decrease of
the activity and an increase of the activation energy with
respect to the corresponding supported monometallic
catalysts. These effects are more pronounced for the
bimetallic catalysts with the highest Sn content. These
behaviors can be related to a certain electronic interaction
between Pt and Sn, with probable alloy formation for the
two bimetallic catalyst series, supported on alumina and
Na-doped alumina. It must be noted that the increase of the
activation energy is more pronounced for PtSn catalysts
supported on alumina than for the ones supported on
Na-doped alumina.
In the case of CP hydrogenolysis, a structure-sensitive
reaction [19], a negligible activity is observed for the dif-
ferent bimetallic catalysts supported on alumina and
Na-doped alumina (except for the PtSn(0.3 wt%)/Al2O3
sample either SI or C which shows a very low activity).
This indicates that Sn together with Na also produces a
geometric modiﬁcation of the metallic phase and therefore,
the concentration of the metallic ensembles necessary for
the hydrogenolysis reaction is practically suppressed.
The addition of Pt and Sn by using different impregnation
sequences, such as coimpregnation or successive impreg-
nation, appears to have a minor effect in both reactions.
3.3 Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR)
Figure 1 shows the TPR proﬁles of bimetallic Pt(0.5
wt%)Sn(0.15;
0.30
and
0.50 wt%)/Al2O3
catalysts,
prepared by successive impregnation, compared with the
monometallic Pt/Al2O3 sample. The TPR proﬁle of the
monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst shows a main reduction
peak at 270 C and a secondary reduction zone at 430 C.
The presence of these two reduction peaks is explained by
the existence of two different oxychlorinated Pt species
originated after the impregnation of the support with
chloroplatinic acid and the subsequent thermal treatments
(drying and calcination steps) [20, 21]. Lieske et al. [20]

studied Pt/c-Al2O3 catalysts treated at different tempera-
tures in oxygen or hydrogen by temperature-programmed
reduction and by hydrogen adsorption, and they found two
chloride-containing surface complexes, [PtIV(OH)xCly]s
and [PtIVOxCly]s. The formation of different oxidized Pt
surface species was conﬁrmed by characteristic uv–vis
spectra by Lietz et al. [21]. The TPR proﬁle of the Sn/
Al2O3 catalyst shows a reduction zone at high temperatures
(500 C), such as it was previously reported [22]. When Sn
is added to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the ﬁrst reduction peak is
broader and shifted to higher temperatures. In this way, for
the catalyst with the highest tin content (0.5 wt%), there is
only a very wide peak appearing at 300 C. It is important
to note that there are not deﬁned reduction signals in the
temperature zone where Sn is reduced in the Sn/Al2O3
catalyst. It should also be noted that there are not important
differences between the TPR proﬁles of the co-impreg-
nated and successively impregnated PtSn catalysts, thus
indicating the presence of similar metallic phases in both
catalysts. The increase of the magnitude of the peak at
lower temperature, its broadening with the tin addition and
the absence of reduction signals corresponding to segre-
gated Sn, would indicate a simultaneous reduction or
co-reduction of both metals, with probable formation of
alloys or intermetallic compounds, in agreement with
results reported in bibliography for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts
and other bimetallic systems [23–26].
TPR proﬁles of bimetallic PtSn catalysts (with different
Sn contents and different impregnation sequences) and
monometallicPt catalyst supported onNa-doped alumina are
shown in Fig. 2. The comparison of the TPR proﬁles
between Pt/Al2O3–Na (0.5 wt%) catalyst, and the undoped
Pt/Al2O3 one (Fig. 1) indicates that the ﬁrst reduction peak is
maintained at similar temperatures (270 C) in both cata-
lysts. However the second reduction peak is shifted to higher
temperatures in Pt/Al2O3–Na catalysts (with a maximum at
approximately 500 C) with respect to that of Pt/Al2O3
catalyst, and its intensity sharply increases. This behavior
could be attributed to the formation of new species related
with Na, such as it was observed by Bocanegra et al. [11],
which would be reduced at lower temperature by hydrogen
activated in the metallic Pt particles. In this sense, C.-H. Lee
and Y.-W. Chen [27] reported for the Al2O3–Na sample, a
main TPR peak at approximately 530 C, due to the reduc-
tion of oxidized Na species. For the Pt/Al2O3–Na catalyst,
the TPR proﬁle displayed only one peak at 200 C, which
could be assigned to the reduction of Pt oxide and oxygen
shared with Na. The authors concluded that there might be a
hydrogen spillover phenomenon on Pt supported on alkali
metal doped Al2O3 during the TPR process in which
hydrogen adsorbed on a Pt atom migrates to Na2O in close
proximity to Pt. Besides, Rodriguez et al. [28] reported in the
TPR proﬁle of Pt/SiO2–K a peak at 410 C, assigned to the
reduction of KOx species by hydrogen activated in the Pt(0)
particles.
By comparing the TPR proﬁles of bimetallic catalysts
supported on Na-doped alumina prepared by different
impregnation sequences, there are no important qualitative
differences attributed to the preparation procedure, but
there are differences among the catalysts with different Sn
contents. Thus, PtSn/Al2O3–Na catalysts with 0.3 wt%
Sn (Fig. 2) show two well-deﬁned reduction peaks, the
former being larger and appearing at low temperature
(280–300 C), and the latter being smaller and appearing at
high temperature (430–470 C). On the other hand, PtSn/
Al2O3–Na catalysts with 0.5 wt% Sn display a wide
reduction zone between 200 C and 500 C, with a maxi-
mum at 300 C.
The reduction zone at low temperatures could corre-
spond to strong interactions between Pt and Sn in agree-
ment with the CH dehydrogenation results. Besides, these
bimetallic catalysts supported on Na-doped alumina do not
show the important reduction peak at 500 C that Pt/
Al2O3–Na catalysts do because of the reduction of new
species related with Na [11, 27, 28]. The absence of this
TPR peak at 500 C in the PtSn/Al2O3–Na catalyst could
be attributed to the presence of strong PtSn interactions that
do not catalyze the reduction of the new species related
with Na, such as free Pt0 species do.

3.4 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS spectra of the Pt 4f level for the PtSn(0.5 wt%)/Al2O3,
PtSn(0.5 wt%)/Al2O3-Na(0.5 wt%)
(C)
and
PtSn(0.5
wt%)/Al2O3–Na(0.5 wt%) (SI) catalysts, reduced ‘‘in situ’’
at 500 C, are presented in Fig. 3. Taking into account that
the Pt 4f peaks overlaps with the Al 2p peaks of the alu-
mina, a procedure of curve synthesis was performed
assuming a Pt4f7/2 to Pt4f5/2 intensity ratio of 1:0.75.
Table 3 compiles Pt4f7/2 and Sn3d5/2 binding energies
corresponding to the three bimetallic catalysts supported on
alumina and Na(0.5 wt%)-doped alumina. The binding
energy of Pt 4f7/2 indicates in all cases only the presence of
surface Pt0 species.
Figure 4 shows the XPS spectra corresponding to the Sn
3d5/2
level
of
PtSn(0.5 wt%)/Al2O3,
PtSn(0.5 wt%)/
Al2O3–Na (C) and PtSn(0.5 wt%)/Al2O3–Na (SI) catalysts
after ‘‘in situ’’ reduction at 500 C. From the deconvolu-
tion of the spectrum of the PtSn(0.5 wt%)/Al2O3 catalyst,
three peaks were obtained at 484.8, 486.5 and 488.2 eV.
The ﬁrst peak corresponds to zerovalent Sn, in agreement
with results found by several authors [29–31]. It must be
noted that Homs et al. [32] attributed the peaks at 483.6 eV
and 485 eV to Sn(0) and Sn in a PtSn alloy (Sn0
al),
respectively. The other two peaks appearing at 486.5 eV
and 488.2 eV, would correspond to different types of
oxidized Sn. According to the literature, the line corre-
sponding to Sn 3d5/2 for SnO has a BE at 486.5–486.8 eV,
while the Sn 3d5/2 line for SnO2 has a BE at 486.5 eV
[29–33], therefore it is not possible to discriminate the
oxidation state of Sn corresponding to the signal positioned
at 486.5 eV. In consequence, the second peak will be
assigned to Sn(II)/Sn(IV) oxides. Besides, the third peak
appearing at 488.2 eV could be probably due to chlorinated
tin species bounded to the support [34–36]. From the
deconvolution of the Sn 3d5/2 line of the spectrum corre-
sponding to the PtSn(0.5 wt%)/Al2O3–Na(0.5 wt%) (C)
and
PtSn(0.5 wt%)/Al2O3–Na(0.5 wt%)
(SI)
catalysts,
three peaks were also obtained at 484.7 eV, 486.5 eV and
488.4 eV for the ﬁrst one and at 484.7, 486.5 and 487.7 eV
for the last one. As it was concluded for the bimetallic
catalyst supported on undoped alumina, the ﬁrst XPS peak
would correspond to zerovalent Sn, while the second and
the third peaks would be due to Sn(II)/Sn(IV) oxides and
to
chlorinated
tin
species
bounded
to
the
support,
respectively.
Table 3 also shows Pt/Al, Sn/Al and Sn/Pt surface
atomic ratios. The presence of Sn(0) in bimetallic catalysts
(variable between 12% and 27% for the three catalysts) and
the absence of this species in the Sn monometallic one,
would indicate a higher Sn reducibility in PtSn catalysts,
these results agreeing with TPR ones. Taking into account
the above mentioned results for reduced bimetallic cata-
lysts, it can be concluded that in these catalysts supported
both on undoped and Na-doped alumina, a fraction of Sn
would be as Sn(0), probably alloyed with Pt, and the
remaining Sn would be as Sn(II)/Sn(IV) oxides and there
would also be chlorinated tin species bounded to the sup-
port. Besides, from the XPS results it was determined the
Sn/Pt surface atomic ratios, which were lower than the bulk
Sn/Pt atomic ratio of the catalysts (2.74). Hence, it can be
inferred that there is not any surface enrichment in Sn for
both catalyst series (Na-doped Al2O3 and Al2O3). This

agree with the XPS studies reported by Balakrishnan and
Schwank [37] who inferred that except for very high Sn/Pt
atomic ratios (1.0 Pt 5.0 Sn/Al2O3 catalyst), the other
catalysts with lower Sn/Pt atomic ratios did not show
enrichment of tin on the surface. Other authors found a
certain Sn surface enrichment in Pt Sn catalysts supported
on other materials such as SiO2 [32], ZnAl2O4 and MgA-
l2O4 [36] and activated carbons [38].
3.5 Reaction of n-butane Dehydrogenation
Table 4 shows the initial (X0, at 10 min of the reaction
time) and ﬁnal (Xf, at 120 min of the reaction time) values
of the n-butane conversions in ﬂow experiments for mono
Pt and bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on Al2O3 and
Al2O3–Na. Besides, the values corresponding to the deac-
tivation parameter (D) along the reaction time, which is
deﬁned as: [(X0–Xf) . 100/X0], are also included in this
Table. It should be noted that alumina and Na doped alu-
mina are inactive for this reaction at 530 C.
It can be observed that the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst has a high
initial conversion, but it deactivates quickly after 2 h of
reaction time (D = 78%). Tin addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst
without Na produces a small decrease both in the initial
conversion and deactivation parameter (D). The lowest
value of D (58%) corresponds to the bimetallic catalyst
with the highest Sn content (0.5 wt%).
Table 4 also shows the initial (S0) and ﬁnal (Sf) values
of the selectivity to all butenes (1-butene, cis- and trans-2-
butenes, and 1–3 butadiene) for the different catalysts. The
dehydrogenating selectivity to all butenes of Pt/Al2O3
catalyst is very low (60%) since the hydrogenolysis
reactions, which produce light gases such as methane,
ethane, ethylene, propane and propylene, are very impor-
tant. Besides, it can be observed in Table 4 that the tin
addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst produces an important
increase of the selectivity to butanes reaching values of
78–83%. This important increase of the dehydrogenation
selectivity goes parallel to a pronounced decrease of the
hydrogenolytic activity.
In conclusion, it could be observed from the reaction
experiments in a ﬂow system that the Sn addition to Pt/
Al2O3 catalyst decreases the deactivation rate of the cata-
lyst along the reaction time (2 h), and favors the selectivity
to butenes.
In order to understand the reasons of the better catalytic
behavior of the bimetallic PtSn catalysts with respect to the
Pt/Al2O3 one, pulse experiments were carried out to
study with more detail the initial steps of the n-butane

dehydrogenation reaction with respect to the carbon
deposition and its relationship with the n-butane conver-
sion, the catalyst deactivation and the selectivity to dif-
ferent products.
Figure 5 shows the effect of the injection of the suc-
cessive pulses on the selectivity to the different butanes,
while Fig. 6 displays the inﬂuence on the carbon retention.
The carbon retention was calculated by a carbon balance
between the inlet and the exit of the reactor.
From data shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the ﬁrst steps of the
dehydrogenation of n-butane can be studied and this will be
useful for a better understanding of the results in the con-
tinuous reaction system. At the ﬁrst stages of the reaction, the
monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst displays a practically neg-
ligible selectivity to all butenes (Fig. 5), and hence a total
hydrogenolytic selectivity (forming exclusively methane).
As the number of pulses increases, the selectivity to all
butenes also increases, with the consequent decrease of the
hydrogenolytic selectivity. This effect is accompanied by an
important carbon retention (or coke deposition) during the
ﬁrst injected pulses. Besides, it can be observed that the
carbon deposition decreases with the number of pulses
(Fig. 6). The monometallic catalyst is very active and it has a
lot of hydrogenolytic sites since during the ﬁrst butane pul-
ses, an important hydrogenolysis or C–C bonds breaking and
a large carbon deposition is produced on the surface of Pt/
Al2O3 catalyst. It must be noted that similar type of sites
would be required for both hydrogenolysis and coke for-
mation reactions. The carbon formation would produce a
selective poisoning of these hydrogenolytic sites, thus
decreasing the selectivity to methane and increasing the
selectivity to the different butenes.
On the other hand, the bimetallic PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts
display a selectivity to all butenes higher than that of the
monometallic sample. It can be pointed out that this
selectivity also increases with the addition of successive
pulses (Fig. 5), and the carbon retention is lower than that
of the monometallic catalyst (Fig. 6). These differences
with the monometallic sample are more pronounced in the
bimetallic sample with the highest tin content. In this sense
Figs. 5 and 6 show that the catalysts with higher tin con-
tents (0.5 wt%) display higher selectivities to butenes
(about 50% for pulse number 20) and lower coke deposi-
tion than the sample with 0.3 wt% Sn.

In consequence, these results indicate that the Sn addi-
tion to Pt produces a decrease of the hydrogenolytic
capacity of the active metal (in agreement with the CP
hydrogenolysis results) and it also decreases the coke
deposition. The results of carbon retention obtained in
pulse experiments indicate that the catalyst deactivation in
the continuous ﬂow system would be due to a pronounced
coke deposition during the ﬁrst steps of the reaction. The
bimetallic catalysts deactivate in a lower degree because
coke is deposited in a lower extension than in the mono-
metallic one. The increase of the selectivity to all butenes
in the bimetallic catalysts, would be associated to the
presence of a modiﬁed metallic phase.
Table 4 (continuous ﬂow experiments) also shows that
Na addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst decreases the initial con-
version (X0) and the deactivation parameter (D) along the
reaction time. Besides, the selectivity to butenes is
increased up to 80% due to a marked decrease of the
hydrogenolytic capacity of the Al2O3–Na.
Four bimetallic PtSn catalysts with two Sn concentra-
tions (0.3 and 0.5 wt%) prepared by co-impregnation and
successive impregnation of Al2O3–Na (0.5 wt%) were
evaluated in the n-butane dehydrogenation in the continu-
ous ﬂow reactor and the results are displayed in Table 4.
The initial conversions of bimetallic catalysts supported on
Al2O3–Na are similar to that of the monometallic Pt/
Al2O3–Na catalysts, while the deactivation parameter D
slightly decreases and the dehydrogenating selectivity
sharply increases up to of 93–98%. These results show the
excellent performances of bimetallic catalysts supported on
Na-doped alumina in the n-butane dehydrogenation.
Taking into account the good catalytic performance of
PtSn/Al2O3–Na catalyst, the behavior of the samples dur-
ing the initial stages of the reaction was evaluated by
means of n-butane pulse equipment. In this way, Fig. 7
shows the inﬂuence of the injected n-butane pulses on the
selectivity to all butenes for PtSn/Al2O3–Na catalysts
compared with the behavior of a monometallic Pt/Al2O3–
Na sample. It is also observed that the monometallic cat-
alyst maintains a very low dehydrogenating selectivity
(lower than 20%) whereas, the bimetallic samples show a
high selectivity to all butenes that increases from 60% (ﬁrst
pulse) up to 75% for the twentieth pulse. This indicates that
the tin addition to Pt/Al2O3–Na (0.5 wt%) catalyst inhibits
the hydrogenolytic reactions and hence increases the
dehydrogenation towards the different butenes.
With respect to the carbon retention during the initial
steps of the reaction (Fig. 8), bimetallic catalysts sup-
ported on Na doped alumina (both C and SI), show
lower carbon retention than the monometallic catalyst
supported on the Na doped support along the different
injected butane pulses. This means that during the initial
moments of the reaction, the tin addition to Pt/Al2O3–Na
catalyst inhibits the coke deposition reactions and the
hydrogenolytic ones.
By comparing Fig. 8 with Fig. 6, it must be noted that
the monometallic catalyst supported on Na-doped alumina,
shows lower carbon retention than both the Na-undoped
monometallic sample and the bimetallic PtSn catalysts
supported on alumina, therefore, Na decreases the coke
deposition since it poisons the acidic sites of the alumina
that cause the carbon formation.
4 Conclusions
The light parafﬁn dehydrogenation into oleﬁns on sup-
ported metallic catalysts is accompanied by undesirable
reactions that produce light products and carbon deposi-
tion. The formation of light products (methane, ethane,

ethylene, propane, etc.) on bifunctional catalysts could take
place through different mechanisms: (a) monofunctional
mechanisms consisted in hydrogenolysis on the metal and
hydrocracking on the acidic function, and (b) bifunctional
mechanism in which the oleﬁn formed on the metal can
migrate to the acidic sites of the support where it is
cracked. In our case, the low acidity of c-Al2O3 is not
enough to promote the direct cracking of n-butane. Hence,
this route would not be important in the formation of light
products.
The results above mentioned show that the Sn addition
to Pt produces important modiﬁcations in the behavior of
these catalysts in the butane dehydrogenation reaction. In
this sense, the use of different impregnation sequences does
not produce important changes in the performance of the
bimetallic catalysts. Results show that Sn addition to Pt/
Al2O3 catalyst decreases the catalyst deactivation. Besides,
the selectivity to all butenes is markedly increased from
55% for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (at 2 h reaction time) up to
values of 85–90% for the bimetallic catalysts (at the same
reaction time).
The different behavior of PtSn/Al2O3 bimetallic cata-
lysts in the butane dehydrogenation with respect to the
monometallic sample is related to strong structural modi-
ﬁcations produced by the addition of the Group IV-A metal
to Pt, such as it can be corroborated from the character-
ization results. In fact, evidences obtained from the shapes
of the TPR proﬁles, XPS results and from the marked
increase of the activation energy values of the CHD reac-
tion, indicate the presence of strong electronic interactions
between both metals. Besides CP hydrogenolysis results
would indicate that Sn not only modiﬁes electronically but
also geometrically the Pt. Thus the Sn appears to be placed
in the vicinities of the active metal (Pt) with the consequent
elimination of the hydrogenolytic and coke formation
ensembles. In this way, there would be particles of PtSn
alloys (probably with different compositions) together with
Pt0 species and oxidized Sn particles, the last ones stabi-
lized on the support. In this way the active centers of the
metallic phase would be diluted by the other species, thus
leading to a phase with a high dehydrogenating selectivity,
and very low hydrogenolytic and coke formation capaci-
ties. Finally, the modiﬁcation of the metallic phase by Sn
addition could also produce a decrease of the adsorption
strength of the coke precursors, such as Bocanegra et al.
observed for PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts [36]. In this sense the
tin addition to Pt could decrease the adsorption of unsat-
urated
molecules
on
the
metal,
thus
favoring
their
desorption to the gas phase, once they were formed. In this
way, more oleﬁns would be produced and hence lower
carbon amounts would be deposited on the metal.
Taking into account the different results of metallic and
acidic phase characterization and the evaluation in n-butane
dehydrogenation, there is a complex effect produced by the
Na addition to PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. The inﬂuence of Na on
the alumina is directly related to the poisoning effect on the
acidic sites of the support, such as can be seen from isopro-
panol dehydration results, but this is not the only effect, since
important modiﬁcations of the characteristics of the metallic
phase are also observed. In this sense, TPR results show the
presence of strong PtSn interactions, with probable alloy
formation, which would be responsible for the decrease of
the reaction rate and the increase of the activation energy in
CHD. Besides, the experiments of CPH show that the alkali
metal addition to bimetallic PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts completely
eliminates the hydrogenolytic ensembles and geometrically
modiﬁes the metallic phase.
These important modiﬁcations in the nature of the
metallic function due to the simultaneous incorporation of
Na and Sn to Pt/Al2O3 would be responsible for the
excellent catalytic performance in the butane dehydroge-
nation that promotes very good conversions, selectivities to
all butenes higher than 95%, and lower deactivation
capacity than those corresponding to bimetallic PtSn cat-
alysts supported on undoped alumina. The excellent sta-
bility of these bimetallic catalysts supported on Al2O3–Na
would be due to a low carbon formation during the reac-
tion, such as is observed in comparing the carbon retention
results during the pulses experiments (Figs. 6 and 8).
