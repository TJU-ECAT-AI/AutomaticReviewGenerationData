Foreword
A signiﬁcant increase of interest in membrane reactors in recent years together
with several research programs which are in progress nowadays has pushed the
authors to consolidate their experiences into this book focusing on the more
attracting and promising processes. Few authors have been working together in an
R&D project started in 2006. The goal of this project was the development of a
new scheme for hydrogen production through stream reforming based on inte-
grating chemical reaction and membrane separation.
One of the main objectives of the project was to build a pilot plant with
industrial-size components. Today the pilot plant (see ﬁgure below) is running and
the experimental campaigns are allowing to verify the reliability of the novel
scheme and at the same time useful information is generated to assess the plant
operation and for scaling-up the design to future industrial size units.Semi-industrial

The R&D project was ﬁnancially supported by the Italian Research Ministry,
and managed by the Chemical Engineering Department of the University of
L’Aquila.
In the next year the experimental program will be oriented both to the theo-
retical aspects of the process and to the technological ones, focusing on the reli-
ability and on the scaling-up criteria for process design of industrial plants.
The research project allowed to compare two different ways of integrating
catalytic reaction and hydrogen separation: one in which the membranes are set
inside the reaction environment (e.g. the membranes constitute the catalytic tube
walls) and another one in which the catalytic module is separated from the
hydrogen permeation one.
With reference to the book content, the authors divided it into 11 chapters. The
book starts with an overview on membrane selective membranes integrated in the
chemical reaction environment. The thermodynamics and kinetics of membrane
reactors are also formulated and assessed for different membrane reactor
architectures.
The rest of the book is divided into three parts. The ﬁrst part deals with the
membranes, membranes manufacturing and mathematical modeling. The second
v
reviews the most attracting application from an industrial point of view. The third
is dedicated to the description of the pilot plant where the novel conﬁguration was
implemented at a semi-industrial scale.
In Chap. 2, an extensive overview concerning palladium-based membranes is
presented. In particular, an assessment of the problems associated with palladium
membranes is given followed by a description of the preparation methods.
Chapter 3 focuses on a proper membrane manufacturing strategy to improve their
industrial competitiveness by lowering production costs. In Chap. 4, the mathe-
matical modeling strategies focused on the simulations of membrane reactors
(MR) and reactor membrane modules (RMM) are presented. In Chap. 5, the
membrane reactor application to natural gas steam reforming is presented and
assessed in the MR and in the RMM conﬁguration. Chapter 6 is dedicated to the
autothermal reforming reaction (ATR) for syngas production. An higher efﬁciency
can be achieved integrating in the reactor an H2 permselective membrane. In
Chap. 7, the water–gas shift reaction is studied. The integration of membranes
inside or outside the shift environment is also analyzed. A techno-economic
analysis is dedicated to the shift reactor integrated with the membrane module

compared to the conventional process. In Chap. 8 the H2S catalytic cracking
process is analyzed. Also in this case the beneﬁts derived by coupling the Claus
reaction and the hydrogen module separation are examined with reference to
different process conﬁgurations. In particular, the high Claus reaction temperature
(900C) and the low working temperature of ceramic membrane modules (600C)
are taken into account in the deﬁnition of process multi-staged conﬁguration.
Chapter 9 deals with alkanes dehydrogenation. Oleﬁns production by catalytic
dehydrogenation of light alkanes might be an alternative to conventional heavy
hydrocarbons cracking. Also in this case the catalytic membrane reactor might
improve the process yield. In particular is studied the coupling of the Pd–Ag
membrane and catalysts usually used in the dehydrogenation process that need to
operate at low H2 partial pressures. In Chap. 10 the characteristics of the pilot
plant discussed at the beginning of this foreword are shown in more detail referred
to the process design and to the ﬁrst positive experimental results.
Each chapter was developed as a whole that can be read without reference to
the others.

Integration of Selective Membranes
in Chemical Processes: Beneﬁts
and Examples
Luigi Marrelli, Marcello De Falco and Gaetano Iaquaniello
1.1 Introduction
Integration of reaction and separation in a single unit is a powerful tool to increase
efﬁciency and economic advantages of many chemical processes. Reactive dis-
tillation, extraction, and adsorption are well-known examples of this technological
resource. Recently, a very promising solution is offered by membrane reactors
(MRs).
A MR is a system coupling reaction and separation of one or more products,
with the separation operation performed by a selective membrane. Although not
yet very used at industrial scale, MRs are attracting the attention of scientists and
engineers in the last two decades, and many interesting articles have appeared in
the literature on their performance and possible application in many ﬁelds of
chemical and biochemical industries. An excellent review about these topics has
appeared in 2002 by Sanchez Marcano and Tsotsis [1].
For biotechnological applications, synthetic membranes entrapping enzymes,
bacteria, or animal cells are used in membrane bioreactors disclosing new
important developments mainly due to the increased stability of immobilized
enzymes, the possibility of their continuous reuse and the absence of pollution of
the products. Membrane bioreactors are of great interest as well for the possibility
of continuously removing metabolites whose presence in the reaction environment
could reduce the productivity of the reactor.
In the ﬁeld of inorganic heterogeneous catalysis, metallic or ceramic membranes
are used to bear the generally more severe thermal conditions. Both dense and

porous, inert and catalytically active membranes have been used in the different
processes analyzed in the scientiﬁc or technical literature. Dense Pd-based mem-
branes or almost dense SiO2 membranes offer very good selectivity and perme-
ability features in all reactions involving generation or consumption of hydrogen
[2]. Composite membranes made of a dense selective layer supported on a porous
material can represent a technical solution when strong mechanical stresses are
imposed to the membrane. Palladium and its alloy membranes were prepared on
stainless steel supports by the electroless plating technique and on alumina supports
by sputtering or by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition [3–6].
Two main advantages are offered by MRs. If the membrane is very selective
with regard to a speciﬁc product, then it is possible to obtain a very pure compound
in the same equipment used to produce it. Furthermore, in the case of reversible
reactions, removing one or more reaction products as they are generated allows
conversions higher than equilibrium values to be reached.
The use of inorganic MRs has been investigated for a number of reactions.
Pd-based membranes, mainly Pd–Ag (23%wt), have been extensively tested for
natural gas steam reforming, which is the main process to produce large amount of
hydrogen. Many experimental works are reported in the literature [7–11], attesting
the good performance in terms of natural gas conversion at much lower operating
temperature than traditional process (methane conversions up to 90–95% at
450–550 vs. 850–1000C).
The dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene [12] and of ethylbenzene to
styrene [13, 14] have been studied in MRs using glass or alumina membranes.
Even if a conversion increase beyond the equilibrium value has been observed in
all the cases, compared with Pd-based membranes, which are much more selective
with respect to hydrogen, porous membranes are less efﬁcient in improving the
conversion. For example, the conversion of cyclohexane to benzene at 200C and
1 atm (equilibrium conversion 19%) is 45% in a Vycor glass MR whereas it
becomes 99.7% in a Pd–Ag MR.
A growing interest in the membrane assisted Water–Gas Shift reaction (WGSR)
is manifested by a substantial volume of the published pertinent literature that
could be grouped around the two most popular hydrogen permselective mem-
branes, based either on palladium [15–19] or silica [20–22]. Among them, Basile
et al. [15] studied the WGSR in a palladium MR and showed the importance of the
membrane preparation method in obtaining high-quality membrane materials. The
best membrane increased CO conversion up to 99.89% at about 330C with a
performance claimed stable for more than 2 months [16].
The most recent application of a silica membrane—prepared by counter-dif-
fusion CVD of TMOS (TetraMethylOrthoSilicate) and oxygen—to H2S decom-
position was reported by Akamatsu et al. [23]. It was claimed that using this
membrane and a commercial desulphurization catalyst at 600C, about 70% H2S
diluted in 99% nitrogen was converted in a relatively short residence time of 7 s.
A similar application but with a different process architecture was proposed by
Galuzka et al. [24] and is reported in Chap. 8.

In general, membrane integration inside the reaction environment involves the
following main beneﬁts:
1. The ability of such a reactor to circumvent thermodynamic limitation of an
equilibrium-controlled process allows the same reactants conversion to be
obtained at a lower temperature or a higher conversion to be reached at the
same temperature.
2. Operating at lower reaction temperatures, new heat integration strategies to
supply heat duty to reactors can be proposed. The use of gas exhausts from a
gas turbine as suggested by [25] or solar heated molten salts [26] could become
applicable and reliable industrial solutions.
3. Lower operating temperatures reduce materials cost as well as increase oper-
ation safety.
4. The expected signiﬁcant process simpliﬁcation and intensiﬁcation would cap-
italize on a new industrial paradigm offered by equipments combining reaction
and separation in one step. New reactors and overall plant design strategy have
to be deﬁned.
In this chapter, a theoretical demonstration of operating beneﬁts for chemical
processes in integrating selective membrane is given to the readers. For practical
cases refer to the following chapters.
1.2 Thermodynamics and Kinetics Background
Reversible reactions are thermodynamically limited since equilibrium conditions
cannot be overcome in the reacting mixture. From a thermodynamic point of view,
equilibrium is represented by a constraint (equilibrium constant) on mole fractions
(or concentrations), temperature, and pressure; this constrain derives from the
second principle of thermodynamics. At equilibrium conditions, no net change in
state variables is observed.
From a kinetic point of view this means that at equilibrium the reaction rate
of the direct reaction is equal to the reaction rate of the inverse reaction. As known,
the reaction rates of the direct and of the inverse reactions generally increase with
the reactant and the product concentrations, respectively. Only when product
concentrations are high enough and reactant concentrations are low enough, i.e.,
when the conversion of a key reactant is high enough, the equilibrium is reached.
Some kinds of reactions (irreversible reactions) require very high conversions to
reach equilibrium conditions at a given temperature, whereas for other reactions a
quite low value of the conversion corresponds to equilibrium. These latter reac-
tions are named reversible reactions according to the thermodynamic statement
that each transformation close to equilibrium is a reversible transformation. In the
case of reversible reactions, the thermodynamic limit can prevent acceptable
conversions to be obtained.

The equilibrium composition depends on temperature and pressure of the
system as well as on the composition of the charge or feed.
A very simple numerical example can be useful to illustrate these subjects.
Let’s consider the following synthesis reaction in gas phase:
A þ B , R
Let be K = 1.5 the equilibrium constant, at a given temperature T. At a not too
high pressure P, the equilibrium composition in terms of mole fraction is easily
obtained from the deﬁnition of K:
K ¼
yR
yA  yB
 P1
ð1:1Þ
If the charge is composed of nA
0 = 5 mol of A and nB
0 = 5 mol of B, equi-
librium conversion of A at P = 1 atm, is XA = 0.367.
This conversion depends on the charge composition. For example, with nA
0 = 5
and nB
0 = 3, at the same temperature and pressure, we get XA = 0.274 at equi-
librium, whereas with nA
0 = 3 and nB
0 = 5 we get XA = 0.399.
The effect of the pressure depends on the phase of reacting system and on the
stoichiometry of the reaction. In the present case of reaction in gas phase with a
negative sum of stoichiometric coefﬁcients, high values of P promote the
conversion.
In any case, higher values of equilibrium conversion can be obtained with a
higher value of the equilibrium constant. For example, with K = 1.5, P = 15 atm
and nA
0 = nB
0 = 5 we get XA = 0.75.
Since the equilibrium constant K depends on the temperature, a way to change
its value is to change T. In particular, K increases with T for endothermic reactions
and decreases for exothermic reactions according the well-known Van’t Hoff
equation:
d ln K
dT
¼ DH
R  T2
ð1:2Þ
with DH [ 0 for endothermic reactions and DH \ 0 for exothermic reactions.
In the case of exothermic reactions, low temperatures should be required to get
acceptable equilibrium conversions but the corresponding slow reaction rates
should require very high residence time in the reactor.
On the contrary, in the case of endothermic reactions, suitable values of K are
often obtained only at very high temperatures with corresponding unacceptable
heat duties, quick deactivation of catalysts, and technical and economic problems
in construction materials.
These shortcomings can be overcome by removing one or more products from
the reaction environment to prevent the equilibrium composition can be reached,
i.e. maintaining yR in Eq. 1.1. at lower values than equilibrium.

1.2.1 Thermodynamics of Reacting Systems
It is well known that a way to express equilibrium condition in a closed system is
to set Gibbs free energy at its minimum value at constant P and T.
dG ¼ 0
P; T


ð1:3Þ
Equation 1.3, that is a consequence of the second Principle of Thermodynamics,
states that any change from the equilibrium state at constant T and P involves an
increase of G.
If the system is a multi-component reacting system, Eq. 1.3 can be expressed in
the following form:
X

i¼1
aili ¼ 0
ð1:4Þ
where ai are the stoichiometric coefﬁcients of the components (assumed to be
positive for products and negative for reactants) and li are the chemical potentials
deﬁned as:
oG



P;T;nj6¼i

ð1:5Þ
If chemical potentials at system conditions are expressed in terms of fugacities fi,
and components are assumed to be pure in the reference state, Eq. 1.4 becomes:

where Dg0 ¼ P ai  g0
i , g0
i are the molar free energies of pure components and zeq

are the mole fractions at equilibrium conditions.
The product at the r.h.s. of Eq. 1.6 is the thermodynamic constant K of the
reaction.

ð1:7Þ
Therefore, Eq. 1.6 can be written in the following form:
ln KðP; TÞ ¼  Dg0
R  T
ð1:8Þ
The value of K depends on the temperature and on the pressure and composition
conditions assumed as reference state. Once pressure and composition are ﬁxed,
equilibrium constant depends on the temperature only.

1.2.2 Afﬁnity and Evolution of Reacting Systems
If a closed system is not at equilibrium, a change of its state variables is observed.
The direction of the system evolution is stated by the second Principle of Ther-
modynamics and corresponds to a positive production of entropy diS [ 0:
diS ¼ 
X
c
j¼1
lj
T dnj  0
ð1:9Þ
where the equality holds at equilibrium conditions. The presence of chemical
reactions in a closed system causes changes in the mole number of reactants and
products which are not independent each other since the stoichiometry of reactions
imposes some constraints.
In the case of r simultaneous reactions and c components, we have:
dnj ¼
X
r
k¼1
aj;k  dnk
j ¼ 1. . .c
ð1:10Þ
where nk is the degree of advancement of reaction k and aj,k indicates the stoi-
chiometric coefﬁcient of component j in reaction k.
Using conditions 1.10 in Eq. 1.9 we get:
diS ¼ 1
T

ð1:11Þ
or in terms of entropy production rate:
diS
dt ¼ 1
T
X

ð1:12Þ
In Eqs. 1.11 and 1.12, Ak is the afﬁnity of reaction k deﬁned as follows:
Ak ¼ 
X
c
j¼1
ajk  lj
ð1:13Þ
In the case of a single reaction, Eq. 1.12 states that the reaction proceeds in the
direction of increasing n when the afﬁnity is positive while n decreases for A \ 0.
At equilibrium, the afﬁnity of the reaction is zero:
A ¼ 
X
c
j¼1
ajlj ¼ 0
Equilibrium condition
ð1:14Þ
In the case of multiple reactions, Eq. 1.12 is satisﬁed even with some terms Ak
dnk \ 0 if the summation is greater than 0. Obviously, at equilibrium conditions,
6
L. Marrelli et al.
since diS must be zero for every inﬁnitesimal variation of degrees of advancement,
the afﬁnity of each reaction has to be zero:
A1 ¼ A2 ¼    Anr ¼ 0
ð1:15Þ
At non-equilibrium conditions, the reaction proceeds from left to right (dn [ 0)
only if A [ 0.
This means (Eqs. 1.6 and 1.13):
Dl þ R  T  ln ^

where:
^
K ¼



ð1:17Þ
In other terms, if ^
K\K mole fractions of products are lower than equilibrium
values and mole fractions of reactants are higher than equilibrium values and the
reaction evolves from left to right.
Vice versa, if ^
K [ K the evolution is from right to left. Finally, if ^
K ¼ K, the
reaction is at equilibrium and its evolution stops.
In each case, outside equilibrium condition, the reaction evolves in the direction
corresponding to a decrease of free energy G of the system.
Selective membrane application allows products mole fraction to be reduced
and consequently the condition ^
K\K, i.e., mole fractions of products lower than
equilibrium values, is veriﬁed, promoting continuously the reaction from left to
right.
1.2.3 Kinetics of Reversible Reactions
The reaction rate of a reversible reaction is the result of two contributions: the
forward reaction that generates the products (chemical species at the right of
the stoichiometric equation) from the reactants (chemical species at the left of the
stoichiometric equation) and the reverse reaction that proceeds in the opposite
direction.
For instance, in the case of a general reaction:
a1A1 þ a2A2 , a3A3 þ a4A4
ð1:18Þ
the net disappearance rate of A1 is given by:
r1 ¼ r1;forward  r1;reverse
ð1:19Þ
1
Integration of Selective Membranes in Chemical Processes
7
where the forward reaction rate generally increases with the concentration of
reactants A1 and A2 whereas the reaction rate of the reverse reaction generally
increases with the concentration of the products A3 and A4.
If the concentrations of the reactants and of the products are such as the forward
reaction rate is higher than the reverse reaction rate, the reaction evolves from left
to right; vice versa the direction of the reaction is from ‘‘products’’ to ‘‘reactants’’
when the product and reactant concentrations make the reverse reaction faster than
the forward reaction.
At equilibrium, no net change is observed in the reaction mixture so that
forward and reverse reaction rates are equal.
Removing a product from the reaction environment usually reduces the reaction
rate of the reverse reaction allowing the reaction to evolve further from left to
right.
1.3 Membrane Reactors
Thermodynamics and kinetics conclusions reported in the previous sections show
that removing one or more products from the reaction environment allows the
reaction to proceed without reaching equilibrium conditions.
A technical way to fulﬁll this plan is to surround the reacting mixture by a
membrane selectively permeable to one of the products at least (Integrated
Membrane Reactor). As a result, the reaction rate of the reverse reaction is lower
than that of the forward reaction and the conversion increases theoretically to the
value corresponding to the complete depletion of the limiting reactant.
A tubular MR is simply composed of two co-axial tubes with the inner one
made of a material selectively permeable to a product of the reaction.
The reacting stream can be fed to the annular region or to the inner tube. The
region where the reactants are fed and the reaction takes place is called reaction or
retentate region whereas the part of the reactor where the products permeated
through the membrane are collected is the permeate chamber.
In the permeate region, the products are usually swept by a gas easily separable
from them (often water vapor). The sweep gas can move co-currently or counter-
currently with respect to the reacting mixture. Each of these schemes has
advantages and drawbacks.
A schematic representation of these two possibilities is shown in Fig. 1.1. The
reaction chamber is the inner tube where a ﬁxed bed of catalyst is assumed to be
present. The permeate chamber is the annular region between the inner tube and
the shell. In the permeate region, the sweep gas ﬂows in co-current mode in
the case (a) and in counter-current mode in the case (b). One or more products of
the reaction are shown to ﬂow through the membrane from the catalytic-ﬁxed bed
toward the permeate region. However, in co-current scheme an inversion of the
ﬂux is theoretically possible at some distance from the inlet section since the ﬂux
8
L. Marrelli et al.
of a compound occurs from regions with high partial pressures toward those with
lower partial pressures. In co-current mode, both reacting mixture and sweep gas
are relatively poor of products in the inlet section so that some compounds gen-
erated by the reaction can diffuse from the reactor to the permeate chamber; but,
along the axis of the reactor the sweep gas is more and more rich of these com-
pounds where their partial pressure in the reacting mixture decreases due to the
transport through the membrane, the slowing of the reaction rate and the pressure
drop along the catalytic bed. When partial pressures have the same value in the
reaction and permeate chambers, the ﬂux stops. In the next sections of the reactor,
an inverse transport from permeate to the reaction region could occur if the effect
of pressure drop is prevailing on the generating rate due to the reaction.
This anomalous behavior is to be taken into account, but it is usually only a
theoretical oddness.
Obviously, this anomaly is not generally allowed in counter-current mode
where the end section of the reactor is characterized by low pressures of removable
compounds in the reacting region but by a practically pure sweep gas entering into
the permeate region.
In Fig. 1.2, a draft of a reactor for methane steam reforming with multiple
membrane tubes for hydrogen separation, operating in co-current mode, is shown.
Unfortunately, the integrated solution of MRs, although very intriguing for the
compactness of the equipments, presents some technical problems.
Some membranes are sensitive to high temperatures so that they could be
incompatible with the reactor temperature. Furthermore, in an integrated MR,
damage to the membrane needs to stop the system, to unload the catalyst
(if present), to substitute the membrane, and a new start-up of the system.
Due to these main reasons, new conﬁgurations called Staged Membrane
Reactor (SMR) or Reformer and Membrane Modules (RMMs) have been proposed
in the technical literature [25–29].
A SMR is a series of modules (RMM) each composed of a traditional reactor
followed by a membrane separation unit. The stream ﬂowing out of the reactor,
rich of reaction products, enters into the separation unit where the selective
membrane removes one of the products. The retentate of the membrane unit is then
fed to the subsequent module. A system of heat exchangers can be present between
each unit and the following one. A system composed of two modules is shown in
Fig. 1.3.

A SMR is not strictly a single equipment but each module and the whole system
offer ‘‘enhanced performance in terms of separation, selectivity, and yield’’ [1].
An optimized design of a SMR requires the evaluation of a number of
parameters such as number of modules, conversion to be achieved in each reactor,
degree of product removal in each membrane unit, temperature distribution etc.
It is easy to realize that a system composed of an inﬁnite number of modules
approaches the behavior of an integrated MR if the reaction volume and the
product removal degree are inﬁnitesimal in each module.
Figure 1.4 shows the RMM test plant having the capacity of 20 Nm3/h of pure
hydrogen, developed and fabricated by Tecnimont KT and deeply described in
Chap. 10. The plant, composed by a two-stages natural gas steam reformer ? Pd-
based separation modules, has demonstrated the feasibility of SMR conﬁguration.

1.4 Theoretical Study of Staged Membrane Reactor

The following very simple reversible reaction in gaseous phase can be used to
show the effect of separation units on the attainable conversion:
A , B

If the equilibrium constant KP at a certain temperature T is assumed to be
KP = 0.4, the equilibrium conversion is:
Xeq
A ¼
KP
KP þ 1 ¼ 0:8
This is the maximum value of conversion attainable in an isothermal reactor
operating at the temperature T. It is easy to show that the reaction volume needed
to achieve a conversion XA in an isobaric and isothermal plug ﬂow reactor is:
VðXAÞ ¼ F0
A
k1  P  XA  ln
Xeq
A
Xeq
A  XA


ð1:21Þ
In order to achieve the equilibrium conversion an inﬁnite volume V of reactor is
required since forward and reverse reaction rates tend to become equal as equi-
librium is approached.
However, if the scheme of Fig. 1.3 is adopted and a membrane unit (Membrane
1) is used to remove a fraction c of the product B generated in the ﬁrst reactor of
ﬁnite volume V1, the reaction can proceed in the second reactor and a conversion
even higher than the equilibrium value can be reached in a ﬁnite reaction volume
given by the sum of the two reactor volumes, V1 and V2.
In Fig. 1.5, the reaction volume required to achieve a conversion XA is shown
for three values of removal fraction c.

L. Marrelli et al.
An inﬁnite volume is required to get XA = 0.8 if no product removal is
implemented, whereas the same conversion can be obtained by very lower vol-
umes (about V = 2 and V = 1.5) when removal ratios (c = 0.3 and 0.5, respec-
tively) are used.
Likewise, in a reaction volume of 1, a conversion XA = 0.572 is achieved when
no product removal is carried out, while conversions XA = 0.625 and XA = 0.674
are obtained with removal fractions c = 0.3 and c = 0.5, respectively.
Figure 1.6 shows the effect of product removal on conversion proﬁles along the
ﬁrst and the second reactor (see Fig. 1.3).
A removal ratio c = 0.5 used in the ﬁrst membrane unit (Fig. 1.3) located at the
outlet of a reactor with a volume V1 = 0.8 allows the conversion proﬁle in the
second reactor to be higher than in the case of absence of membrane unit.
1.5 Recycle of Retentate
The ﬂuid not permeated at the end of the set of modules contains reaction products
as well as un-reacted compounds which could be a valuable material. This mixture
undergoes different treatments depending on the nature of the material and the
kind of the process. In some cases, a further separation and puriﬁcation operation
are used after the reaction step to recover useful compounds. For example, in
the case of steam reforming of light hydrocarbons for producing hydrogen, a
pressure swing adsorption (PSA) step could be used for recovering pure hydrogen
not permeated through the membrane of the reaction system.
An interesting solution is used in cogeneration processes when the retentate gas
has a high energetic content. In this case, a part of the exiting gas is burned to give
power to an electric generator whereas the residual part is recycled to the reaction
system to convert the un-reacted compounds. A simple scheme of the recycle
system is shown in the Fig. 1.7, while a complete process scheme of a two steps

RMM plant with a recycle stream and electricity power production by retentate gas
is reported in Fig. 1.8 (refer to [25, 29] for a complete description and assessment
of the plant).
It is known that, in a traditional tubular reactor, the recycle of a portion of the
exiting stream makes worse the performance of the reactor; however, the case of
MRs is very different due to the removal of a product and considerable
improvements can be achieved.
Figure 1.9 shows the effect of recycle ratio R on the conversion.
The conversion XA is deﬁned as the reacted fraction of A in the feed leaving the
system with the efﬂuent. The removal percentage q is the ratio between the ﬂow
rate of B in permeate and the ﬂow rate of this product entering the membrane
module.

L. Marrelli et al.
Calculations have been performed at the indicative values of parameters
reported in Table 1.1 with the simplifying assumptions of isothermal and isobaric
reactor and inﬁnite selectivity of membrane.
Fixing the ﬂow rate of B in the permeate is a realistic basis since in many cases
the aim in using a membrane system with recycle is just to obtain a speciﬁc ﬂow
rate of the product with a high conversion of the reactant. Obviously, the
dependence on the recycle ratio R of the fraction of B to be removed in the
membrane requires a suitable design of the membrane module which depends on
the adopted value of R.
1.6 Design of Membrane Module
The ﬂux JB through a membrane layer depends on the properties of the layer
material and of the compound B, on the thickness of the membrane and on the
difference of partial pressures between the two chambers of the module. The
properties of materials are taken into account by means of the membrane

permeability which is affected by the temperature as well. A detailed description of
mass transport through Pd-based membrane is given in Chap. 2 of this book. When
Sieverts-Fick law is valid, the ﬂux of B is given by:
JB ¼ PeBðTÞ


p0:5
B;ret  p0:5




where d is the thickness of the dense membrane, pB,ret and pB,perm are the partial
pressures of B in the retentate and permeate regions, respectively and:
PeBðTÞ ¼ Pe0
B  exp  Ea
R  T


ð1:23Þ
is the permeability which depends on the temperature T according to the Arrhenius
behavior.
PeB
0 is the pre-exponential factor, and Ea is the apparent activation energy. The
partial pressure in the permeate side can be controlled by means of the total
pressure and by the ﬂow rate of the sweeping gas.
However, in order to allow a given ﬂow rate of a product to be removed from
the reaction mixture a suitable membrane surface area must be available.
Once ﬂow rate WB and the other operating parameters are given, the calculation
of the membrane surface area S is straightforward since is:
S ¼ WB
JB
ð1:24Þ
When pB,ret and pB,perm are constant at each point of the membrane, the cal-
culation is very simple. This could be the case of a membrane module located
outside the reactor.
However, in the case of integrated MBRs, with the membrane inside the
reactor, partial pressures pB,ret and pB,perm and, often, temperature T change, in
general, along the tubular reactor. Therefore, Eq. 1.22 gives the local ﬂux at a
given section of the MBR, and Eq. 1.24 must be given in differential form:
dS ¼ dWB
JB
ð1:25Þ
where dWB indicates the inﬁnitesimal ﬂow rate of B crossing the membrane
through the surface dS. The overall surface area is, then, calculated by integration
of Eq. 1.25.
Anyway, the surface area of a given membrane depends on the ﬂow rate, the
thickness of the layer, the pressure difference, and the temperature. Compatibly
with speciﬁc requirements of the process, required membrane surface can be
minimized through a suitable choice of the operating parameters, especially of the
pressures. This is an important issue due to the generally high speciﬁc cost of
selective membranes.

1.7 Final Remarks
The potential of MRs is enormous. In particular, they play a key role in reversible
endothermic reactions where their use can provide high reactant conversion at
relatively lower temperatures. This will make possible to avoid fuel combustion in
ﬁred heaters to supply the required reaction heat and could allow multiple heat
sources at low temperature to be used, ranging from gas turbine exhausts to solar
heated molten salts or even helium from a nuclear power [24, 25, 29].
A new conﬁguration will then emerge where heat and power are cogenerated
and a considerable energy saving is achieved, reducing the products’ manufac-
turing costs. The cogenerative scheme presented in Fig. 1.8 refers to natural gas
steam reforming, but this concept can easily be extended to other chemical
processes.
The number of possible applications of MRs is indeed large, but commercial
applications are emerging slowly due to a number of practical issues to be solved
such as membrane stability, mass transfer limitation (low ﬂux), high membrane
production costs etc. This is still a task far from completion and will require a
close cooperation of catalyst scientists, material scientists, and chemical engineers.
Chap. 2 was then devoted to the membranes state of the art to better understand
what kind of progress is required in terms of materials and engineering problems.
Cost of manufacture could be considerably reduced if membranes will ﬁnd bulk
applications; Chap. 3 of this book deals with technical solutions aimed to such cost
reduction. Chap. 4 is devoted to mathematical modeling which is a tool widely
used in process development and optimisation.
A part from the steam reforming there are other interesting applications in the
petrochemical industry: methane dry reforming, catalytic partial oxidation, auto-
thermal reforming, water gas shift, H2S cracking, and hydrocarbon dehydroge-
nation. More details about some of these applications are given in Chaps. 5, 6, 7, 8,
and 9.
Finally, in Chap. 10 the RMM pilot plant shown in Fig. 1.4 is described, and
some preliminary operational data are presented and discussed.

2.1 Introduction
The ﬁrst scientiﬁc study on palladium-based membranes, available in the Elsevier
Scopus database [1], where more than 6,000 scientiﬁc journals are taken into
account, is dated 1955, when Juenker et al. [2] analyzed the use of palladium
membranes for hydrogen puriﬁcation. Today, it is well known that the palladium
membranes are, mainly, applied in the ﬁeld of gas separation and, particularly, in
the issue of the hydrogen rich-stream puriﬁcation [3]. As reﬂected by the data of
Fig. 2.1, the scientiﬁc interest towards palladium-based membranes is increased
22
A. Basile et al.
especially in the last two decades. The statistics on the scientiﬁc publications in the
contest of palladium membranes applications reported in the ﬁgure were made by
means of Elsevier Scopus database.
Moreover, Fig. 2.2 points out further statistics data on palladium membranes
applied in the ﬁeld of membrane reactors (MRs), devices combining the separation
properties of the membranes with the typical characteristics of catalytic reaction
steps in only one unit. In particular, this ﬁgure reports the number of publications
on palladium-based membranes reactors with respect to the total number of
publications in the membrane reactors area.
The progress in the ﬁeld of palladium-based MRs is due to their capacity to
produce a pure hydrogen stream, owing to inﬁnite hydrogen perm-selectivity with
respect to all other gases. Moreover, in the last years the ‘‘hydrogen economy’’ has
taken place in order to solve the problematic concerning the climate change and air
pollution due to the emissions caused by the use of fossil fuels [4]. In particular,
the ‘‘hydrogen economy’’ has been developed with the aim of using hydrogen as

an energy carrier, producible from renewable sources as an alternative to fossil
fuels.
Nevertheless, the commercialization of pure palladium membranes is still
limited by several factors:
• pure palladium membranes undergo the embrittlement phenomenon when
exposed to pure hydrogen at temperatures below 300C,
• pure palladium membranes are subject to deactivation by carbon compounds at
temperature above 450C,
• pure palladium membranes are subject to irreversible poisoning by sulphur
compounds,
• the cost of palladium is high.
In order to reduce the aforementioned drawbacks, palladium can be alloyed
with a variety of other metals in order to manufacture membranes able to increase
the hydrogen permeability shown by the pure palladium membranes.
As a main scope, the present chapter will give an overview on the general
classiﬁcation of the membranes, paying particular attention to the palladium-based
membranes and their applications, pointing out the most important beneﬁts and the
drawbacks due to their use. Finally, the application of palladium-based membranes
in the area of the membrane reactors will be illustrated and such reaction processes
in the issue of hydrogen production will be discussed.
2.2 Membrane Classiﬁcation
As indicated by IUPAC deﬁnition [5], a membrane can be described as a
structure having lateral dimensions much greater than its thickness through which
mass transfer may occur under a variety of driving forces such as gradient of
concentration, pressure, temperature, electric potential, etc. A schematic repre-
sentation of a two-phase system separated by a membrane is given in Fig. 2.3,
where the Phase 1 is usually considered as the feed, while the Phase 2 as the
permeate.
As schematically resumed in Fig. 2.4, the membranes are classiﬁed on the base
of their nature, geometry and separation regime [6].
The classiﬁcation based on the membrane nature distinguishes them into bio-
logical and synthetic ones, differing completely for functionality and structure [7].
Biological membranes are easy to be manufactured, but they present many
drawbacks such as limited operating temperature (below 100C) and pH range,
problems related to the clean-up and susceptibility to microbial attack due to their
natural origin [7].
Synthetic membranes can be subdivided into organic (polymeric) and inorganic
(ceramic, metallic) ones according to their operative temperature limit: polymeric
membranes commonly operate between 100 and 300C [8], above 200C the
inorganic ones.

In the viewpoint of the morphology and/or membrane structure categorization,
the inorganic membranes can be also subdivided into ceramics and metallic.
In particular, ceramics membranes differ according to their pore diameter in
microporous (dp\2 nm), mesoporous (2 nm\dp\50 nm) and macroporous (dp[
50 nm) [5]. Finally, metallic membranes can be categorized into supported and
unsupported.
Generally, inorganic membranes are stable between 200 and 800C and in
some cases they can operate at elevated temperatures (ceramic membranes over
1000C) [9].

Depending on their geometry, the membranes can be subdivided in tubular,
hollow ﬁbre, spiral wound and ﬂat sheet [10]:
• Tubular membranes are easy to clean and show good hydrodynamic control, but
as important drawbacks they require relatively high volume per membrane area
unit and present high costs.
• Hollow ﬁbre membranes can be considered as practical and cheaper alternatives
than conventional chemical and physical separation processes. They offer high
packing densities and they can withstand relatively high pressure owing to their
structural integrity. In this contest, they allow ﬂexibility in system design and
operation.
• Spiral wound membranes offer advantages such as compactness, good mem-
brane surface/volume and low capital/operating cost ratios. Nevertheless, they
are not suitable for viscous ﬂuid and are difﬁcult to clean.
• Flat sheet membranes offer moderate membrane surface/volume ratios. How-
ever, they are susceptible to plugging due to ﬂow stagnation points, difﬁcult to
clean and expensive.
A further membrane classiﬁcation is based on the separation mechanism. There
are three separation mechanisms depending on speciﬁc properties of the compo-
nents [11]:
1. separation based on molecules/membrane surface interactions (e.g., multi-layer
diffusion) and/or difference between the average pore diameter and the average
free path of ﬂuid molecules (e.g. Knudsen mechanism);
2. separation based on the difference of diffusivity and solubility of substances in
the membrane: solution/diffusion mechanism;
3. separation due to the difference in charge of the species to be separated:
electrochemical effect.
Based on these mechanisms, the membranes can be further classiﬁed in porous,
dense and ion-exchange. In Table 2.1, the different diffusion mechanisms for
porous and dense membranes are reported.
In the case of porous membranes:
• Poiseuille (viscous ﬂow) mechanism occurs when the average pore diameter is
bigger than the average free path of ﬂuid molecules. In this case, the collisions
among the different molecules are more frequent than those among the mole-
cules and the porous wall: as a consequence no separation takes place [12].

• Knudsen mechanism occurs when the average pore diameter is similar to the
average free path of ﬂuid molecules. In this case, the collisions of the mol-
ecules with the porous wall are very frequent and the ﬂux of the component
permeating through the membrane is calculated by means of the following
equation [12]:

where Ji is the ﬂux of the i-species across the membrane, G the geometrical
factor, which takes into account the membrane porosity and the pore tortuosity,
Mi molecular weight of the i-species, R universal gas constant, T absolute
temperature, Dpi pressure difference of species and d membrane thickness.
• Surface diffusion is achieved when one of the permeating molecules is adsorbed
on the pore wall due to the active sites present in the membrane [13]. This type
of mechanism can reduce the effective pore dimensions, unfavouring the
transfer of different molecular species [14]. However, this diffusion can take
place also in the presence of a Knudsen transport. This mechanism is less
signiﬁcant by increasing the temperature owing to the progressive decrease of
the bond strength between molecules and surface.
• Capillary condensation occurs when one of the components condenses within
the pores due to capillary forces, which are sufﬁciently strong only at low
temperature and in presence of small pores. If the pores dimension is small and
homogeneous and the pores are uniformly distributed on the membrane, this
mechanism can offer high selectivity [15, 16]. Generally, the capillary con-
densation favours the transfer of relatively large molecules [17].
• Multi-layer diffusion is developed when the molecule/surface interactions are
strong. This mechanism is like to an intermediate ﬂow regime between surface
diffusion and capillary condensation [18].
• Molecular sieve takes place when the pore diameters are very small, allowing
the permeation of only smaller molecules.
In the case of dense membranes, the transport mechanism is a solution–diffusion
mechanism, in which the dissociated molecules on the gas/membrane interface are
adsorbed at the atomic level on the membrane surface. The atoms diffuse through
the membrane and are re-combined to form molecules at the gas/membrane
interface. Afterwards, they desorb.
Among all types of membranes, the inorganic dense membranes have attracted
the interest of many researchers due to their capacity to separate completely a
product from gaseous mixtures [19]. In particular, the dense palladium membranes
are used because of their complete hydrogen perm-selectivity. In the last years, the
increasing interest towards this type of membranes is, also, due to hydrogen
application as energy carrier.
For this reason, in the following, a general introduction to pure palladium
membranes is given.

2.3 Hydrogen Production and Palladium Membranes
In the current fossil fuel economy, the fossil fuels burning causes the emission of
greenhouse gases and other pollutants. In order to mitigate the air pollution and the
climate change, the use of alternative technologies is become necessary. In this
contest, great interest is paid to PEMFCs, which are capable to produce electricity
directly from hydrogen and oxygen, without combustion, making the process non-
polluting [20]. A PEMFC uses a permeable polymeric membrane as the electrolyte
(Fig. 2.5).
PEMFCs are characterized by low operative temperature (80–100C), high
current density, compactness, fast start-up and suitability for discontinuous oper-
ation [21]. These features make PEMFCs the most promising and attractive can-
didate for a wide variety of power applications ranging from portable/micropower
and transport to large-scale stationary power systems for buildings and distributed
generation [22], as shown in Fig. 2.6.
Today, the hydrogen for supplying the PEMFCs derives, mainly, from fossil
fuels (48% from natural gas, 30% from oil and 18% from coal) [24]. Nevertheless,
owing to the climate change as well as the cost increase of oil and gas, the
development of a strategy for exploiting alternative and renewable sources repre-
sent a top priority in which hydrogen could be an inexhaustible energy carrier [25].
Nevertheless, the full commercialization of PEMFC systems needs a stable
supply of hydrogen, which must be characterized by high purity for avoiding the
CO poisoning of the PEMFC anodic catalyst [26].
Nowadays, the dominant technology for direct hydrogen production is steam
reforming from hydrocarbons. Generally, reforming reactions, carried out in
conventional ﬁxed bed reactors (FBRs), produce a hydrogen rich gas mixture
containing carbon oxides and other by-products as well as the unreacted reac-
tants. Therefore, in the viewpoint of feeding a PEMFC, which can tolerate only
Fig. 2.5 Diagram of a PEM

few ppm of CO, the hydrogen going out from a conventional reformer needs to
be puriﬁed by means of the following processes: two-steps water gas shift
reactors followed by a separation/puriﬁcation unit (PSA, Pd membrane, etc.), as
reported in Fig. 2.7a [27].
Many researchers have proposed, as an economically more advantageous
method, the use of a process able to produce a pure hydrogen stream in only one
system [28–33]. In this contest, dense palladium MRs are able to carry out both the
reaction and separate pure hydrogen in the same device (Fig. 2.7b).
In fact, although, niobium (Nb), vanadium (V) and tantalum (Ta) offer higher
hydrogen permeability than palladium in a temperature range between 0 and
700C, as shown in Fig. 2.8, nevertheless these metals give a stronger surface
resistance to hydrogen transport than the palladium (Pd). For this reason, dense
palladium membranes are preferentially used.
The hydrogen molecular transport in the palladium membranes occurs through
a solution/diffusion mechanism, which follows six different activated steps [35]:
• dissociation of molecular hydrogen at the gas/metal interface;
• adsorption of the atomic hydrogen on membrane surface;
• dissolution of atomic hydrogen into the palladium matrix;
• diffusion of atomic hydrogen through the membrane;
• re-combination of atomic hydrogen to form hydrogen molecules at the gas/metal
interface;
• desorption of hydrogen molecules.

29
Depending on temperature, pressure, gas mixture composition and thickness of
the membrane, each one of these steps may control hydrogen permeation through
the dense ﬁlm [28]. As a result, the hydrogen permeating ﬂux can be expressed by
means of the following equation:

where n (variable in the range 0.5–1) is the dependence factor of the hydrogen ﬂux
to the hydrogen partial pressure, JH2 the hydrogen ﬂux permeating through the
membrane, Pe the hydrogen permeability, d the membrane thickness, pH2;ret and
pH2;perm the hydrogen partial pressures in the retentate (the reaction side) and per-
meate sides (the volume in which the hydrogen permeating through the membrane
is collected), respectively.
This equation even points out the inverse proportionality to the membrane
thickness. The role of the membrane thickness is very important: on one hand, a
thinner membrane offers a higher permeability; on the other hand, thicker
membranes are necessary in order to ensure the mechanical resistance and
strength.
When the pressure is relatively low, the diffusion is assumed to be the rate-
limiting step and the factor n is equal to 0.5. In this case, Eq. 2.2 becomes the
Sieverts–Fick law [36]:
JH2;SievertsFick ¼ PeH2=d 

ð2:3Þ
On the contrary, at high pressures the hydrogen–hydrogen interactions in the
palladium bulk are not negligible. In this case, n becomes equal to 1:
JH2 ¼ PeH2=d  pH2;ret  pH2;perm


ð2:4Þ
The relationship between hydrogen permeability and temperature follows an
Arrhenius behaviour (Eq. 2.5), while ‘‘n’’ generally does not depend on the
temperature:
PeH2 ¼ Pe0

ð2:5Þ
where Pe0 is the pre-exponential factor, Ea the apparent activation energy, R the
universal gas constant and T the absolute temperature.
As a consequence, when Sieverts–Fick law is valid, the hydrogen ﬂux is written
in terms of the so-called Richardson’s equation:

Nevertheless, although the pure palladium membranes are characterized by a
complete hydrogen perm-selectivity, their commercialization is limited by some
drawbacks such as relatively low hydrogen permeability and high cost [37].
2.3.1 Problems Associated with the Pure Palladium Membranes
The most important problem associated with the use of pure palladium membranes
is the ‘‘hydrogen embrittlement’’ phenomenon. When the temperature is below
300C and the pressure below 2.0 MPa, the b-hydride phase may nucleate from the
2
Pd-based Selective Membrane State-of-the-Art
31
a-phase, resulting in severe lattice strains (see Fig. 2.9), so that a pure palladium
membrane becomes brittle after a few cycles of a ¡ b transitions [38–40].
These transitions do not take place as a change of the lattice structure, but as a
lattice dilatation. The b-hydride phase formation is represented as a clustering of
hydrogen atoms, whose energy of attraction, being associated with the lattice,
strains around the dissolved hydrogen atom [41].
A possible solution to avoid this phenomenon is represented by the use of a Pd-
alloy containing another metal, such as silver. The role of silver is explained by its
electron donating behaviour, being largely similar to the one of the hydrogen atom
in palladium. Silver and hydrogen atoms would compete for the ﬁlling of electron
holes [42].
Another critical problem is represented by the palladium surface contamination
of Hg vapour, hydrogen sulphide, SO2, thiophene, arsenic, unsaturated hydrocar-
bons, chlorine carbon from organic materials. In particular:
• Poisoning of sulphur compounds: Pd-coated membranes could rapidly be
destroyed after exposure to a gas stream containing hydrogen sulphide and the
poisoning effects are irreversible [43, 44]. Palladium becomes palladium
sulphide, whose lattice constant is twice than of pure Pd and, thus, the structural
stress leads to the formation of cracks.
• Poisoning of CO: the presence of CO in a feed gas stream could cause a
decrease in the hydrogen permeation ﬂux, because the adsorbed CO displaces
the adsorbed hydrogen and further blocks hydrogen adsorption sites [45].
Moreover, this reduction becomes more signiﬁcant at low temperature (below
150C) or high CO concentration [46]. CO is adsorbed on the palladium surface
blocking available dissociation sites for hydrogen. In order to improve the
chemical stability of the metal membranes it is possible:
– to use different types of Pd alloys constituted by other metals such as Cu, Ni,
Fe, Pt and Ag,
– to prepare nanostructured or amorphous thin alloy membranes.

temperatures [42]
32
A. Basile et al.
• Poisoning of H2O: the presence of water vapour has a more negative effect on
hydrogen permeability than the presence of CO [47]. The adsorbed water
molecules dissociate on the surface of the Pd ﬁlm:
H2Oads ! OHads þ Hads
and=or
H2Oads ! Oads þ 2Hads
ð2:7Þ
where the Hads may permeate into the bulk of the Pd ﬁlm [48]. H2O is
recombined through these reactions:
2OHads ! H2Ogas þ Oads
and=or
Oads þ 2Hads ! H2Ogas
ð2:8Þ
Therefore, the process of H2O dissociation/recombinative desorption contami-
nates the palladium surface with adsorbed O.
• Poisoning of coke: both hydrogen permeance and perm-selectivity of a thin
palladium membrane decrease after it is brought in contact with coke at elevated
temperature [49]. This phenomenon can be addressed for the fact that carbon
atoms penetrate into the palladium lattice and cause the failure of the membrane
owing to the expansion of the palladium lattice.
Moreover, the palladium membranes are still very expensive. In order to reduce
their cost it is possible to develop low palladium content based alloy trying to
reduce the Pd-based layer thickness [50–52].
2.4 Palladium-based Membranes
Generally, the palladium-based membranes can be subdivided into supported and
laminated ones. In the supported membranes, a thin dense layer of a palladium
alloy is deposited onto a porous support such as porous Vycor glass (silica gel).
Nevertheless, using this kind of support, the palladium layer is easily stripped off
owing to the loss of an anchor effect [53].
Other types of porous glass materials are represented by SiO2, Al2O3 and B2O3,
giving excellent anchor effect and adherence [53]. Also porous stainless steel (PSS)
can be considered as a valid support due to its mechanical durability, its thermal
expansion coefﬁcient close to that of palladium and the ease of gas sealing [53].
The upper temperature limits of the supported membranes depend on: the
material, the chemical atmosphere and the support characteristics such as porosity
and pore diameter [54].
In the laminated membranes, thin palladium (or palladium alloys) layer avoids
the formation of oxides on the metallic surfaces resulting in a reduction of the
hydrogen adsorption activation energy and, as a consequence, in an increase of the
hydrogen permeation ﬂux [55].
Generally, the palladium alloys have some advantages with respect to the pure
palladium membranes such as a reduced critical temperature for the a–b phase
transition. For example, Pd–Ag membranes can operate in hydrogen atmosphere at
2
Pd-based Selective Membrane State-of-the-Art
33
temperatures below 300C without observing embrittlement rather than pure
palladium membranes [42]. Moreover, in some cases, the hydrogen permeability
of palladium alloys is higher than pure palladium, as reported in Table 2.2. In fact,
as shown in Fig. 2.10, the hydrogen ﬂux through the Pd–Ag membranes reaches
the maximum value at 350C and 2.2 MPa with a 23% Ag content. In details, the
permeability is 1.7 times higher than one of a pure Pd membrane. The Pd–Cu alloy
even shows a maximum value of hydrogen ﬂux with 40% Cu content, although
these membranes suffer a permeation decrease when exposed at 900C for a long
time [56].
Moreover, the palladium alloys improve chemical resistance of the membranes.
For example, Pd–Cu and Pd–Au increase the resistance to H2S [59] as well as
palladium-coated amorphous Zr–M–Ni (M = Ti, Hf) alloy membranes are resis-
tant enough in a hydrogen atmosphere and have stable hydrogen permeability in
the range of 200–300C [60].
In order to further reduce the membrane cost, low palladium content based
alloys can be produced [52]. In fact, Basile et al. [61] demonstrated that thin dense
Ti–Ni–Pd membranes with a low palladium content (4.17 vs 77.0% of the Pd–Ag

nomical point of view.
2.4.1 Methods for Producing Palladium-based Membranes
Palladium-based membranes can be produced by several methods, depending on
some factors such as the nature of the metal itself, the manufacturing facilities,
required thickness, surface area, shape, purity, etc. Nevertheless, no one method
can produce a membrane, which combines advantageously all these factors.
Therefore, the choice of the production method becomes a compromise between
these factors [42]. At lab-scale, the thickness as well as the continuity and
imperviousness of the ﬁlm are considered the most important factors [42].
In particular, in the last few years, the main aim has been to reduce the thickness of
the palladium-based ﬁlms.
Criscuoli et al. [62], for example, carried out an economical analysis of
palladium-based MRs, comparing the costs between the conventional apparatus
and different membrane systems for pure hydrogen production. In particular, the
authors studied the effect of the palladium thickness and membrane permeability
to hydrogen on the costs of membrane devices. They demonstrated that both
higher permeabilities and lower thickness improve the hydrogen removal leading
to a decrease in membrane area for a pure hydrogen recovery and a cost reduction.
The authors concluded that MRs could represent a possible alternative to con-
ventional apparatus for palladium thicknesses equal or lower than 20 lm. More-
over, the authors highlighted that current methods of preparing palladium-based
membranes are still expensive due to the inadequate productivity per unit mem-
brane area. A cost reduction for the Pd-based membranes could be achieved
through a massive production as detailed in Chap. 3.
The most important production methods of palladium-based membranes are
described in the following.
The Conventional cold rolling is the most diffuse technique for producing
metallic plates or sheets at laboratory scale [63]. It involves:
• melting the raw materials with chosen composition at very high temperature,
• ingot casting,
• high temperature homogenization,
• hot and cold forging or pressing, followed by repeated sequences of alternate
cold rolling and anneals, down to the required thickness.
If the cooling speed of melts is fast, amorphous materials (metallic glasses) can
be realized obtaining good characteristics such as high mechanical toughness,
considerable corrosion resistance, good electronic properties, high catalytic
activities, reversible hydrogen storage, etc. [64, 65]. The cold rolling treatment can
enhance the hydrogen solubility in palladium and its alloys owing to the accu-
mulation of hydrogen excess in the stress ﬁeld around dislocations, formed during
2
Pd-based Selective Membrane State-of-the-Art
35
the process. This effect can be gradually eliminated during annealing of the
deformed membranes by increasing the temperature [66].
In Physical vapour deposition (PVD) method, the solid material to be deposited
is evaporated in a vacuum system through physical techniques, followed by
condensation and deposition as a thin ﬁlm on a cooler substrate. PVD is a very
versatile method for manufacturing of pure metal ﬁlms, alloys or compounds of
thickness up to 50 lm [67]. At relatively high temperature, a thermal treatment is
generally necessary to homogenize the composition of a multilayer deposit [68].
Sputtering and magnetron sputtering (MS) is an evaporation technique used for
PVD under vacuum. A sputtering system consists of a vacuum chamber containing
a target (a plate of the material to be deposited) and the substrate (i.e., the
membrane), in which a sputtering gas (an inert gas such as argon) is introduced to
provide the medium in which a glow discharge, or plasma, may be initiated and
maintained. Afterwards, positive ions strike the target and remove target atoms and
ions by momentum exchange. The condensation of these species over the support
produces a thin ﬁlm. Before sputtering the metal, the ion bombardment of the
support is carried out for cleaning its surface and improving the ﬁlm adherence.
Spray pirolysis is a very simple technique in which a metal salt solution is
sprayed into a heated gas stream and, then, pyrolyzed. It could be useful in the case
of not requiring very high purity of hydrogen due to the relatively low H2/other
gases perm-selectivity shown by using this technique.
Compared to the other deposition techniques, the spray pyrolysis method shows
quite low separation factor, indicating that the technique needs some improve-
ments, especially for producing dense ﬁlms.
Solvated metal atom deposition method (or co-condensation technique) allows
an easy introduction of the metal phase on the inner surface of a tubular mem-
brane. Palladium vapour obtained by the resistive heating of a crucible loaded with
Pd shots is co-condensed in a typical glass reactor. At the end of the reaction, the
ﬂask is allowed to warm up to -40C and the resulting yellow-brown solution
siphones under argon and handles at low temperature, using the Schlenk tube
technique. The amount of palladium in the isolated solution is determined by
X-ray ﬂuorescence. Palladium particles are deposited on the inner surface of a
tubular membrane by ﬁlling the membrane tube (ﬁtted with Teﬂon stoppers at the
ends) with the above solution and heating up to room temperature.
In Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process, a chemical reaction involving a
metal complex in the gas phase is performed at a controlled temperature and the
produced metal deposits as a thin ﬁlm by nucleation and growth on the substrate [69].
The deposition takes place on the hot substrate positioned in the CVD reactor. As
in the case of PVD technique, the reaction temperature can be reached either by
resistive heating of the substrate or by other heating sources [70].
Electrochemical vapour deposition (EVD) is, essentially, a variation of the
CVD technique. In the EVD process, for example, a porous substrate separates a
mixture of chlorine vapours (ZCl3, YCl3, etc.) and an oxygen source (water vapour
or oxygen) [11]. Initially, the reactants from both sides of the support inter-diffuse
into the pores and form solid oxides, as in the CVD process. When the pores are
36
A. Basile et al.
closed, oxygen ions are conducted across the solid oxide and the oxide ﬁlm grows
on the chlorine side.
In the Electroplating (EP) method, a substrate, used as a cathode, is coated with
a metal or an alloy in a plating bath [71]. Palladium can be easily deposited in
thick and ductile deposits, providing a good control on the composition of the bath,
its temperature and current density [72]. The thickness of deposited ﬁlms can be
mastered by controlling electroplating time and current density [73, 74] and ﬁlm
values from a few microns up to millimetres can be obtained. However, the large
domains of alloy composition is not easy to control since the relative deposition of
two metals simultaneously from the same solution depends on the simplicity of
controlling chemical complexing in the bath [11].
The Electroless plating deposition (ELP) technique is based upon the controlled
auto-catalyzed decomposition or reduction of meta-stable metallic salt complexes
on target surfaces [75]. In the case of palladium, usually, the substrate should be
pre-seeded with palladium nuclei in an activation solution in order to reduce the
induction period of the autocatalytic plating reaction. For some applications, this
technique provides strong beneﬁts such as uniformity of deposits on complex
shapes and hardness. Palladium and some of its alloys are among the few metals
that can be deposited in this way [11]. However, this method presents some
drawbacks such as difﬁcult thickness control, costly losses of palladium in the
bath, not guaranteed purity of the deposit and so on [75].
Sol–gel technique is a technique adopted for the preparation of thin materials on
which the morphological characteristics (e.g., thickness and porosity) must be
accurately controlled. Composite membranes resulting from this process are
usually microporous and mesoporous, in which permeation of gases is mainly
controlled by surface transport and/or the Knudsen ﬂow mechanism [11].
Molecular layering (ML) technique is one of the most promising methods of
membrane modiﬁcation at the atomic level [76, 77]. The ML method is based on
the chemisorption of reagents on a solid substrate surface and consists of the
irreversible interaction of low-molecular reagents and functional groups of a solid
substrate surface under the conditions of continuous reagent feed and the sub-
sequent removal of the formed gaseous products.
However, each aforementioned method presents beneﬁts and drawbacks. For
example, both CVD and ELP techniques are able to coat a complex-shaped
component with a uniform thickness layer. Unfortunately, non desired compounds
and impurities can be formed and incorporated in the palladium layer, reducing the
ﬂux of hydrogen through the ﬁlm. Moreover, by ELP method, it is not easy to
control the thickness of the ﬁlm. On the contrary, an important beneﬁt of the
electroless coating is that it is well suited to applications on available commercial
tubular membranes. CVD is not an economic process due to the strict conditions
required for the process.
In conclusion, Table 2.3 reports the permeation data of different palladium-
based composite membranes, produced, principally, by ELP or CVD techniques.
Many parameters are reported in the table: membrane type and thickness, tem-
perature and pressure ranges of the permeation experiments, hydrogen ﬂux,

thin layer and relative bibliography. Generally, it is possible to state that the
porous palladium-based membranes show high hydrogen ﬂux and low hydrogen
selectivity, while dense palladium-based membranes show low hydrogen ﬂux and
high hydrogen selectivity.
2.5 Reaction Processes Using Palladium-based Membranes
The ﬁrst use of palladium membranes was registered in the 1866, when Graham
used a palladium membrane to separate hydrogen from gases mixtures [96].
In 1915, Snelling patented the hydrogen removal through palladium or platinum
tubes from a reactor using a granular catalyst for dehydrogenation reactions [53].
In 1964, Gryaznov proposed as a novel application of palladium-based membranes
a method for carrying out simultaneously the evolution and the consumption of
hydrogen in a dense tubular palladium reactor, where palladium is permeable only
to hydrogen and also serves as a catalyst.
The ﬁrst commercial application of a dense 23 wt% Pd–Ag membrane was in
the 1964, when Johnson Matthey used this membrane for purifying a hydrogen
rich-stream [97]. Successively, Johnson Matthey also developed a hydrogen
generator constituted by a palladium MR fed with a methanol/water mixture. This
plant was used in small scale by British Antarctic Survey in 1975 [98, 99].
Moreover, the ﬁrst pilot-scale composite palladium MR for direct ultra-pure
hydrogen production has been realized by the largest gas company in Tokyo
(Tokyo Gas Company Ltd.) [100].
Recently, a reformer and membrane modules (RMM) test plant having the
capacity of 20 Nm3/h of hydrogen has been designed and constructed by
Tecnimont KT near Chieti, in Italy. This plant is described in Chap. 10 of this
book.
Actually, the palladium-based MR represents an alternative solution to con-
ventional systems for pure hydrogen production to be supplied to a PEMFC.
In fact, the palladium-based MR, combining in only one unit the separation phase
with the reaction steps, offers the following advantages with respect to a FBR:
• to combine the chemical reaction and the gas separation in only one system
reducing the capital costs,
• to enhance the conversion of equilibrium limited reactions. In fact, by the
selective removal of one or more products from the reaction side, the thermo-
dynamic equilibrium restrictions can be overcome, due to the so-called ‘‘shift
effect’’,
• to achieve higher conversions than FBRs, operating at the same MR conditions,
or, on the contrary, the same conversion but operating at milder conditions,
• to improve products yield and selectivity,
• and, especially, to produce a pure hydrogen stream.

Pd-based Selective Membrane State-of-the-Art

In order to produce pure hydrogen stream by using a palladium-based MR,
many chemical reactions can be used. Some of them are reported in Table 2.4.
In this chapter, a particular attention will be address to the following reactions:
• methane steam reforming,
• dry reforming of methane,
• water gas shift,
• ethanol steam reforming,
• methanol steam reforming,
• bioglycerol steam reforming,
• acetic acid steam reforming.
Moreover, in order to solve the problems related to the environmental pollution,
previously mentioned, it will be interesting to investigate the hydrogen production
via reforming reactions of bio-fuels such as methanol, glycerol, ethanol, biogas,

2.5.1 Methane Steam Reforming
Generally, methane steam reforming (MSR) reaction is carried out in FBRs
between 800 and 900C due to the endothermicity of the reaction [27].
CH4 þ 2H2O  4H2 þ CO2
DH
298 K ¼ 165:0 kJ=mol
ð2:9Þ
Only at this elevated temperature, the methane conversion is complete. Fur-
thermore, in the strenuous conditions, the catalyst undergoes deactivation due to
carbon formation. As an alternative, using Pd-based MRs it is possible to reach
complete methane conversion at lower temperature (*500C) as summarized in
Table 2.5. For example, Lin et al. [102, 103], carried out the MSR reaction in a
palladium-based MR, obtaining methane conversions exceeding 80% at temper-
ature between 350 and 500C rather than 850C, necessary in a FBR. Chen et al.
[104] obtained almost 100% methane conversion at 550C with respect to 27%
obtained in a FBR. In particular, the authors reached 95% pure hydrogen recovery,

conﬁrming that the selective removal of hydrogen from the reaction zone allows to
obtain methane conversion signiﬁcantly higher than a FBR.
Generally, Table 2.5 shows that the palladium-based MRs application allows
reducing the operative conditions required for carrying out the MSR reaction in a
FBR and to obtain high methane conversion as well as high pure hydrogen
recovery.
Chapter 5 will report a detailed assessment of methane steam reforming MR
performance. Moreover, it has to be cited the test plant fabricated by Tecnimont
KT and described in Chap. 10, which is composed by a series of reformer reactors
and Pd-based membrane separators and has a capacity of 20 Nm3/h of pure H2
production.
2.5.2 Dry Reforming of Methane
One of the most important drawback related to the methane dry reforming reaction
is the carbon deposition.

This was highlighted by different scientists such as Galuszka et al. [112], who
observed coke deposition carrying out the reaction (2.10) at 550–600C in both
FBR and MR (housing a dense palladium membrane prepared by electroless
plating technique). Gallucci et al. [113] performed the methane dry reforming
reaction in FBR and both porous and dense Pd–Ag MRs at 400 and 450C. The
authors demonstrated that the MRs give lower carbon deposition with respect to

the FBR and, in particular, the lower carbon deposition is obtained when the dense
membrane is used.
In this case, the palladium-based MR beneﬁts result in higher methane con-
version than FBR, as shown in Table 2.6, and a reduction of the carbon deposition
with respect to a conventional reformer, as above reported.
2.5.3 Water Gas Shift Reaction
The water gas shift (WGS) reaction is one of the most important industrial pro-
cesses used to produce hydrogen:
CO þ H2O ¼ CO2 þ H2
DH
298 K ¼ 41:1 kJ=mol
ð2:11Þ
The applications and the research studies performed on this kind of reaction
were realized by many scientists. In particular, a great literature is present on this
issue concerning the use of palladium-based membrane reactors, as resumed
brieﬂy in Table 2.7, where CO conversion values obtained in MR and compared
with the thermodynamic equilibrium ones of some scientiﬁc works are reported.
In particular, among these works, Kikuchi et al. [115] demonstrated that, using a
20 lm layer of palladium-coated onto a porous glass tube produced by the elec-
troless plating method, allows to obtain almost complete CO conversion.
Basile et al. [116] studied the WGS reaction using a MR consisting of a
composite palladium-based membrane realized with an ultrathin palladium ﬁlm
(*0.1 lm) coated on the inner surface of a porous ceramic support (c-Al2O3) by
the co-condensation technique. The authors pointed out the beneﬁt of applying a
palladium MR, taking into account that, at 320C and 1.1 bar, the thermodynamic
equilibrium of CO conversion is around 70%, while the authors obtained with the
MR CO conversion of around 100%. Moreover, the same authors illustrated that a
complete CO conversion could be reached by using a composite membrane with a
thinner palladium layer (10 lm Pd ﬁlm coated on a ceramic support) [117].
Moreover, Iyoha et al. [118] observed that the CO conversion can decrease
from around 90% to around 70% once a palladium MR is replaced with another

In Table 2.7, the comparison between the CO conversion values obtained in
different palladium-based MRs and the equilibrium ones is reported, demonstrat-
ing the capacity of palladium-based MRs to overcome the thermodynamic limits
and to obtain high CO conversion. Chapter 7 reports a detailed assessment of
selective membrane application for WGS process.
2.5.4 Ethanol Steam Reforming
Bioethanol is an aqueous solution containing between 8.0 and 12.0 wt% of ethanol
and some by-products depending on the raw material used [124]. Nevertheless, the
bioethanol distillation is an expensive process, because of the azeotrope presence.
For this reason, in the last years, bioethanol is directly used as fuel in steam
reforming reaction. Moreover, an excess of water improves the palladium-based
MR performances reducing also the CO content as by-products.
C2H5OH þ 3H2O ¼ 2CO2 þ 6H2
DH
298 K ¼ þ157:0 kJ=mol
ð2:12Þ
A great part of scientiﬁc literature is focused on carrying out this reaction using
ethanol produced by no-renewable sources [125–130]. Concerning bioethanol
steam reforming (BESR) reaction, only few studies are deal with both FBRs [131–
133] and MRs use [134–136], as reported in Table 2.8.
In particular, Gernot et al. [134] used a composite Pd-based MR, whose
structure consists of a three layers stacking. This membrane structure lowers
the thermal expansion stresses between the membrane and the support as well as
the quantity of noble metal active layer. At 600C and for 500 h of work, as best

hydrogen stream collected with an impurity content \
1.0%.
Iulianelli et al. [135, 136] studied from an experimental point of view the steam
reforming reaction of a simulated bioethanol mixture (water/ethanol feed molar
ratio = 18.7/1 mol/mol without other typical by-products) in a dense Pd–Ag MR
in order to produce pure hydrogen. The dense Pd–Ag membrane was prepared by
cold rolling and diffusion welding technique [137]. As reported in the table,
working at 400C and 3.0 bar, the authors obtained a complete bioethanol con-
version (*85.0% for the FBR working at the same MR operating conditions) and
around 95.0% of pure hydrogen recovery.
However, Table 2.8 shows the capacity of palladium-based MRs to obtain
higher ethanol conversions than the FBRs.
2.5.5 Methanol Steam Reforming
Methanol is conventionally produced from natural gas [138]. Alternatively,
methanol can be obtained from biomass, such as wood and agricultural waste [102].
Renewable methanol presents different advantages as fuel and raw material. For
example, it is more easily transportable than methane or other fuel gases, it has high
energy density and does not require desulphurization.
Methanol steam reforming (SRM) (3.15) is an endothermic reaction, feasible at
temperatures of 200–300C [31].

As indicated in Table 2.9, Wieland et al. [31] carried out the SRM reaction
using three different palladium-based MRs (Pd75–Ag25, Pd60–Cu40 and Pd–V–Pd).
Owing to the low stability of the vanadium-based membrane at pressures above
4.2 bar, the authors compared the performances of the SRM reaction when carried
out in a Pd–Ag and a Pd–Cu MRs. The authors showed that a higher pure hydrogen
recovery is obtained using the Pd–Ag MR (at 25.0 bar, 300C, the hydrogen
recovery of Pd–Ag MR is 96.0% against 78.0% of the Pd–Cu MR).

Lin et al. [102, 139] used a double-jacketed supported palladium MR packed
with Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst. The authors obtained a pure hydrogen recovery over
70.0%, concluding that this process can constitute an alternative solution of on-
board hydrogen generation for electric vehicle fuel cells.
Basile et al. [140] compared the performances in terms of methanol conversion
and pure hydrogen production with respect to the ones of a FBR. The authors
demonstrated that the MR gives a higher methanol conversion at each operating
condition investigated. As best results, a 80.0% methanol conversion is reached
working at 250C and 1.3 bar, as reported in Table 2.9.
Arstad et al. [141] used a self-supported, Pd/(23 wt%) Ag-based MR (with a
thickness of 1.6 lm) achieving 100.0% the production of pure hydrogen. Hence,
the authors concluded that the low-thickness of the palladium-based membrane
can represent a fundamental step for reducing the palladium-cost and making
competitive the hydrogen separation technologies by palladium-based membrane.

process, the oil is mixed with a metallic base (sodium or potassium hydroxide) and
an alcohol (methanol or ethanol). The reaction produces methyl or ethyl ester
(biodiesel) and glycerol as a byproduct, which can be used as a renewable source
[147]. To the best of our knowledge, at moment, only Iulianelli et al. [148, 149]
studied glycerol steam reforming (GSR) reaction in a dense Pd–Ag MR, as
reported in Table 2.10.

The authors studied the catalyst inﬂuence on the reactor performances (glycerol
conversion and pure hydrogen recovery), using two commercial catalysts:
Co/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3. Using the Co/Al2O3 catalyst and at 4.0 bar and 400C,
the authors obtained a glycerol conversion of 94.0% and a pure hydrogen recovery
higher than 60.0%. On the contrary, using the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst, the authors
achieved around 20.0% glycerol conversion and 16.0% pure hydrogen recovery at
5.0 bar. Iulianelli justiﬁed these low performances as the main drawback due to the
combination of ruthenium with an acid support as Al2O3, unfavourable for GSR
reaction. Moreover, the authors observed that carbon formation, taking place
during the reaction, affects negatively the performances of the Pd–Ag membrane
in terms of a lower hydrogen permeated ﬂux and catalyst deactivation.
2.5.7 Acetic Acid Steam Reforming
Acetic acid is a renewable source and can be easily obtained by fermentation of
biomass [150]. Few studies [151–154] concerned the acetic acid steam reforming
(AASR) reaction for producing hydrogen by means only FBRs.

carrying out the AASR reaction [155, 156], as shown in Table 2.11. In these
studies, the AASR reaction was performed in a dense Pd–Ag MR packed with two
kinds of catalyst: a Ni-based commercial catalyst in the ﬁrst case and both

2.6 Conclusions
An extensive overview concerning palladium-based membranes was presented,
subsequently to a general classiﬁcation of the membranes. In particular, an
assessment of the problems associated with the pure palladium membranes was
presented, which was followed by a description of the preparation methods of
palladium-based membranes and their industrial applications.
In particular, this chapter highlighted the importance of palladium-based
membranes for producing pure hydrogen. Applicability of these membranes is
limited by sensitivity towards certain species and cost. When these membranes are
applied to the reactor system, the MRs constitute an interesting alternative
approach to the FBRs, owing to the ability of the palladium-based MRs in per-
forming simultaneously the reaction process and the selective hydrogen separation.
In this route, the continuous hydrogen removal permits to obtain higher reaction
conversions than the thermodynamic equilibrium, which is the upper limit to be
considered in a FBR. In the meanwhile, a pure hydrogen stream for directly
feeding a PEMFC without needing any other puriﬁcation process can be obtained.

Membranes: An Economic Perspective

3.1 Introduction
In the past decade, large demand in the production of hydrogen for petroleum and
petrochemical industry and the potential future demand for hydrogen economy
have created considerable interest and efforts to develop more efﬁcient processes
for hydrogen separation and production. H2 separation and production by mem-
branes and membrane reactors at high temperatures and pressures was and still
seems to be one of the most promising developing areas. Although the major
development effort, if dense Pd membranes are excluded due to their low per-
meation ﬂux, thin palladium ﬁlms supported on porous substrates have not yet
reached a commercial stage due to some technical issues as long term permeance
and selectivity stability, but also to the cost related to their manufacture. In this
chapter, a short review of palladium membranes characteristics, hydrogen trans-
port phenomena together with deposition techniques is provided.
Moreover, a review of membranes and ‘‘membrane modules’’ actually available
on the market, not comprehensive of all the suppliers, allows focusing on the main
costs determinants in the membranes production cycle.

On such a basis, a comparison of ﬁlm and supports deposition technologies was
illustrated to better understand how from a lab technique it is possible to move to
an industrial manufacturing process and reach a volume high enough to sustain
important economics of scale.
3.2 Membranes Characteristics
A suitable hydrogen membrane has to have the following features: high selectivity
for hydrogen, high permeability in order to operate with high ﬂows and limited
surfaces, good chemical and structural stability in order to avoid deterioration
under exertion.
The more interesting conﬁgurations for a hydrogen selective membrane are
then:
1. ceramic support ? thin hydrogen selective layer
2. metallic support ? metallic interdiffusion barrier ? thin hydrogen selective
layer
Two different geometries, planar and tubular (Fig. 3.1), can be realized from a
practical point of view:
3.2.1 Membrane Support
The support gives the membranes the necessary mechanical strength and it usually
does not show selective properties.

Clearly a support, as part of the membrane, has to be gases permeable and has
to be characterized from a speciﬁc interconnecting porosity to allow the gases
crossing. Therefore, a suitable support has to be realized with a thickness of a few
millimeters of sintered materials, either metallic or ceramic ones [1]:
• Metallic materials (as sintered stainless steel) are advantageous due to their
thermal expansion coefﬁcient close to that of Pd-based ﬁlms, removing the
disbonding phenomenon due to differential thermal expansion. Moreover, this
materials show a relevant weldability and a low cost [1, 2].
Among the different steels used for these applications, we report as an example:
AISI316L [3, 4] and 316L SUS [5].
A problem related with metallic materials used at high temperature is the
intermetallic diffusion of the palladium in the metallic support [6–8]. In order to
avoid this problem, it is necessary to realize a speciﬁc interdiffusion barrier [1]
between the Pd-based selective layer and the metallic support.
• Owing to developments in the ﬁltration industry, various ceramic ﬁlters with
controlled pore size are commercially available today. These materials can also
be used as supports for palladium composite membranes, but their poor physical
strength and, in particular, their incompatibility with conventional techniques
for joining parts (e.g., welding) causes difﬁculties in membrane module con-
struction. The ceramic materials used for membranes syntheses reported in
literature are: a-alumina, c-alumina [9, 10] and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)
[11] also in multilayer substrates Pd/c-Al2O3/a-Al2O and Pd/YSZ/a-Al2O3 [11].
3.2.2 Interdiffusion Barrier
Such a barrier has to have a good chemical stability and has to be a reduced
thickness (few lm) in order to allow the gas crossing.
Its unique rule is to avoid the Pd alloy interdiffusion in the steel support.
One of the main objective to aim in realizing an interdiffusion barrier is to
obtain a layer extremely adherent, dense, homogeneous, and with continuous
thickness.
Actually, several types of barrier materials have been tested in literature: TiN
[6], TiO2 [12], Al2O3 [8], a-Fe2O3, c-Al2O3, and YSZ [13]. TiN was considered
the most promising type of barrier.
3.2.3 An Experimental Study: Support 1 Interdiffusion Barrier
In the frame of the mentioned research project, the Dept. of Chemical Engineering,
Environment and Materials of the Rome University ‘‘La Sapienza’’, together with
3
Hydrogen Palladium Selective Membranes
59
Tecnimont-KT SpA, has focused on a traditional manufacturing path, realizing an
innovative substrate for metallic membranes.
Two different conﬁgurations for the substrate have been considered:
– metallic tubular support with titanium nitride barrier;
– metallic planar support with alumina barrier.
To realize the support, sintered austenitic stainless steel (AISI316L) with a
porosity [
1 lm has been used. In order to obtain a suitable support with smaller
pore size the AISI 316L has been resintered by GKN Sinter Metal Filters GmbH,
Radevormwald, Germany. GKN technology consists in spraying the sintered
stainless steel with a ﬁne layer of nano-powder. The second sinterization step
allows realizing a steel support with a surface porosity of 0.1 lm. Figures 3.2 and
3.3 show the support surface and section after resintering step, respectively.
The GKN supports have been coated with TiN as intermetallic diffusion barrier
with three different thicknesses (0.6, 1.5, and 2.6 lm): the Titanium based layer
was realized by Galileo Avionica SpA through Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)
technique. The 2.6 lm thickness layer has homogenously recovered the porous
stainless steel (PSS) support, and has shown a very high permeance to hydrogen.
Figure 3.4 shows the resintered support surface covered with a 2.6 lm layer of
TiN. Figure 3.5 shows the section support.
It is highlighted the excellent adhesion of TiN on the low porosity support.
AISI316L resintered planar supports have been realized with the same GKN
technology. This support has been covered by Acktar Ltd with a 5 lm Al2O3
barrier by RTE technology.
Figures 3.6 and 3.7 highlight the excellent coverage of the surface.
Two optimum substrates for ﬁnal membrane synthesis have been identiﬁed.

3.2.4 Pd Alloy Selective Layer
The selective layer, that allows separating the hydrogen from the other gases, is
strictly connected with the chemical and physical membrane characteristics.
The morphology of the surface on which the selective layer has to be deposited
is a key issue for a proper integration. Pore size and porosity of the deposition
surface inﬂuence the membrane thickness and consequently its permeability:
increasing the deposition surface pore size, the thickness of the alloy required to
obtain a dense and continuous layer increases reducing hydrogen ﬂow. Moreover,

increasing porosity, the effective available area for hydrogen permeation increases
together with hydrogen ﬂow [14].
Another parameter that has to be considered is the support roughness: higher is
the roughness of the deposition surface, more irregular is the deposition surface.
3.2.4.1 Permeation Mechanisms of Hydrogen in Palladium
Hydrogen-permeable metal membranes are extraordinarily selective, being
extremely permeable to hydrogen but essentially impermeable to all other gases.
The gas transport mechanism is the key to the high selectivity. Hydrogen
permeation through a metal membrane follows the multistep process illustrated in
Fig. 3.8 and already described in Chap. 2. Hydrogen molecules from the feed gas
are adsorbed on the membrane surface, where they dissociate into hydrogen atoms.
Each individual hydrogen atom loses its electron to the metal lattice and diffuses
through the lattice as an ion. Hydrogen atoms emerging at the permeate side of the
membrane reassociate to form hydrogen molecules, then desorb, completing the
permeation process. Only hydrogen is transported through the membrane by this
mechanism; all other gases are excluded [15].
The palladium–hydrogen system is a two-component system (Pd and H) whose
degrees of freedom are determined by the number of existing phases at working
temperature and pressure.
The palladium–hydrogen system (Fig. 3.9) [16] shows the presence of two
phases, a and a0. In both the phases, hydrogen occupies, randomly, the interstitial
octahedral sites of the f.c.c. Pd lattice.
The a phase is a low hydrogen concentration phase and it can be seen as a
solution of atomic hydrogen in palladium.
The a0 phase is a high hydrogen concentration phase and it can be seen as an
expanded phase (hydride). The a and a0 phases are separated by a region where
both coexist.

Hydrogen Palladium Selective Membranes

Above the critical temperature (293C, 22.5 at %H) there is no distinction
between the a and a0 phase [16].
To draw the Pd–H phase diagram, we need to determine the absorption iso-
therms, indeed various authors, Wicke, Nernst, Frieske, Lasser, Blaurock [17–21],
observed a hysteresis in the plateaus region, absent in monophasic regions, which
translates into absorption process equilibrium pressure higher then desorption
process equilibrium pressure (with the same concentration).
In the a ? a0 phase transition at temperatures and hydrogen pressures below
293C and 2 MPa, respectively, the lattice expands at the phase transition point
increasing in volume by about 10% [22]. This unit cell volume change can result in
mechanical strains, physical distortions, and possibly failure of the palladium if
cycled through the palladium hydride phase transition region.
Many authors tried to interpret the hysteresis
phenomenon, including
Ubbelohde [23]:
• when the a0 hydride phase is formed, this phase is subjected to internal
mechanical stress, so the free energy change is lower. When the desorption step
occurs, hydrogen is preferentially released from regions subjected to stress.
Hydrogen is so released at higher pressure than would occur from a stable a0
phase;
• the formed a0 phase is in a state of ‘‘disorder’’ (with hydrogen atoms in octa-
hedral and tetrahedral interstitial positions) compared to the ordered ‘‘state’’
(hydrogen in octahedral sites) and the transition between the two states is
delayed by an energy barrier [24].
So, during the desorption both the mechanical deformation that the disordered
state would lack and the curve would be close (if not identical) to the equilibrium
condition.
The problem can be remedied by exposing the palladium to hydrogen only at
temperatures above 293C. Since the hydride is the only phase present at these

data. Dashed line gives a best

conditions, palladium will not be subjected to the stresses caused by the phase
transition [25].
If the sorption and dissociation of hydrogen molecules is a rapid process, then
the hydrogen atoms on the membrane surface are in equilibrium with the gas
phase. The concentration c of hydrogen atoms on the metal surface is given by
Sievert’s law:
c ¼ Kp1=2
ð3:1Þ
where K is Sievert’s constant and p is the hydrogen pressure in the gas phase.
At high temperatures (
[
300C), the surface sorption and dissociation processes are
fast, and the rate-controlling step is diffusion of atomic hydrogen through the metal
lattice. Holleck et al. [26] have observed that the hydrogen ﬂux through the metal
membrane is proportional to the difference of the square roots of the hydrogen
pressures on either side of the membrane. At lower temperatures, however, the
sorption and dissociation of hydrogen on the membrane surface become the rate-
controlling steps, and the permeation characteristics of the membrane deviate from
Sieverts’ law predictions [15].
Diffusion of the hydrogen through the palladium is attributed to the ‘‘jumping’’
of hydrogen atoms through the octahedral interstitial sites of the face-centered
cubic palladium lattice [25, 27]. The lattice-diffusional mode of mass transfer for
hydrogen results in the essentially inﬁnite selectivity observed with dense palla-
dium membranes. The hydrogen permeability of palladium increases with tem-
perature because the endothermic activation energy for diffusion dominates the
exothermic adsorption of hydrogen on palladium [25, 28].
Many disputes were created about the adsorption speed of hydrogen on the
sample. Of course, as already Wagner noticed [29], the sample history (preparation
method, purity, crystalline state, cleaning of the membrane surface by oxidation or
sulfur deposition from trace amounts of hydrogen sulﬁde) dramatically affects the
absorption mechanism.
Indeed, recent studies of Kay et al. [30, 31] showed that the probability of
hydrogen molecule dissociation on the surface of palladium is close to unit. This
circumstance excludes that this step is the slow step of the absorption process.
By thermal desorption measurements, the above-mentioned authors argued that the
phenomenon speed is governed by atomic hydrogen diffusion from the surface
towards the massive phase.
At higher H pressure, the system no longer behaves ideally and the absorption
initial speed increases with charge. This is interpreted as an effect due to lattice
expansion which accompanied the absorption of hydrogen: indeed, the same effect
of speed raising is achieved mechanically expanding the palladium lattice or
introducing atoms of Ag (Pd–Ag alloy).
The silver, in addition to increasing the solubility of hydrogen in palladium,
contributes to mechanical stability and lower cost of the membrane.
The optimal weight composition of the PdAg alloy is 23% Ag, 77% Pd [32, 33].

3.3 Membranes Deposition Techniques
Any thin ﬁlm deposition process involves three main steps: (a) production of the
appropriate atomic, molecular, or ionic species; (b) transport of these species to the
substrate through a medium; (c) condensation on the substrate, either directly or
via a chemical and/or electrochemical reaction, to form a solid deposit.
There are many processes today used for ﬁlm deposition. However, often these
are variants of two basic processes: physical process and chemical process.
Only the most widely used processes for the production of composite mem-
branes for hydrogen separation are mentioned below.
3.3.1 Physical Processes
The physical process consists of physical vapor deposition (PVD) and it can be
classiﬁed as follows: (1) thermal evaporation; (2) sputtering.
(1) Thermal evaporation: The thermal evaporation process comprises evaporating
source materials in a vacuum chamber below 10-4 Pa and condensing the
evaporated particles on a substrate.
The thermal evaporation processes are classiﬁed as [34]:
(a) Vacuum deposition Resistive heating is most commonly used for the
deposition of thin ﬁlms. The source materials are evaporated by a resis-
tively heated ﬁlament or boat, generally made of refractory metals such as
W, Mo, or Ta, with or without ceramic coatings. Crucibles of quartz,
graphite, alumina, beryllia, boron-nitride, or zirconia are used with indi-
rect heating. The refractory metals are evaporated by electron-beam
deposition since simple resistive heating cannot evaporate high melting
point materials.
(b) Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) This process is an improved thermal pro-
cess used for the deposition of alloys and/or compounds with a controlled
chemical composition. In laser deposition, a high-power pulsed laser is
irradiated onto the target of source materials through a quartz window.
A quartz lens is used to increase the energy density of the laser power on
the target source. Atoms that are ablated or evaporated from the surface
are collected on nearby sample surfaces to form thin ﬁlms [35].
(2) Sputtering: When a solid surface is bombarded with energetic particles such as
accelerated ions, surface atoms of the solid are scattered backward due to
collisions between the surface atoms and the energetic particles. This phe-
nomenon is called back-sputtering, or simply sputtering.
When a thin foil is bombarded with energetic particles, some of the scattered
atoms transmit through the foil. The phenomenon is called transmission
sputtering [36].
66
G. Iaquaniello et al.
3.3.2 Chemical Processes
The chemical process can be classiﬁed as follows: (1) thermal chemical vapor
deposition (CVD); (2) plating process.
(1) CVD process: The CVD process is realized when a volatile compound of the
substance to be deposited is vaporized, and the vapor is thermally decomposed
into atoms or molecules, and/or reacts with other gases, vapors, or liquids at
the substrate surface to yield nonvolatile reaction products on the substrate.
Most CVD processes operate at relative high temperature (near 1,000C)
in the pressure range of a few hundred Pa to above the atmospheric pressure of
the reactants. Several CVD processes are proposed to increase the efﬁciency of
the chemical reaction at lower substrate temperatures [34]. Plasma-assisted
chemical vapor deposition (PACVD) is one of the modiﬁcations of the con-
ventional CVD process. In the PACVD system, electric power is supplied to
the reactor to generate the plasma. The ions in the plasma show slightly higher
energy than the neutral gas molecules at room temperature. Typically the
temperature of the ions in plasma is around 500 K.
(2) Plating processes:
(a) Electroplating consists of the deposition of a metallic coating on an
electrically conducting surface which acts as the cathode in an electro-
lytic cell, whose solution contains ions of the metal to be deposited. This
is a relatively complex technology that involves a large number of steps
[37].
(b) Electroless plating is a non galvanic type of plating method that involves
several simultaneous chemical reactions in an aqueous solution occurring
without the use of external electric current. The chemical reactions are
accomplished when hydrogen is released by a reducing agent, normally
sodium hypophosphite, and is oxidized to produce a negative change on
the surface of the substrate. This autocatalytic deposition method enables
metal coating of non conductive textile material which can be used for
precision work in conventional manufacturing. Unlike electroplating, the
absence of electric ﬁeld contributes to a uniform plating thickness.
Under properly controlled conditions all the above-mentioned methods produce
good quality thin layers but electroless plating has the advantage of easy scale-up
and the ﬂexibility to coat the metal ﬁlm on supports of different geometry.
However, the main disadvantage is the difﬁculty to control the composition of
the alloy.
PVD sputtering has several advantages like:
(a) synthesis of ultrathin ﬁlms with minimal impurity;
(b) easily controllable process parameters;
(c) ﬂexibility for synthesizing alloys;
(d) the ability to generate nanostructured ﬁlms.
3
Hydrogen Palladium Selective Membranes
67
The last two points are very important in membrane preparation for hydrogen
separation because fabricating membrane alloys helps to overcome the problem of
hydrogen embrittlement, while the nanostructured ﬁlms may have unique size-
dependent properties, e.g., a high hydrogen permeation [38].
3.4 Membranes Available on the Market
Only few companies are able to supply Pd-based membranes or membranes
‘‘modules’’; market is still limited at laboratory scale membranes or modules for
small pilot units. Here, below a short review of some membranes providers.
3.4.1 ECN Hydrogen Separation Modules (Hysep)
The Energy research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN), produces and offers a line
of hydrogen separation modules (Hysep) on a pre-commercial basis for evaluation
purposes. The technology is based on Palladium membranes which are capable of
separating high purity hydrogen from a gas mixture.
An essential element of the Hysep technology is the use of thin ﬁlm palladium
composite membranes to enable low cost and reliable hydrogen separation.
The supported palladium layer in the Hysep module has a thickness as low as
3–9 lm, a substantial improvement over current commercial available palladium
membranes, which are based on self supporting metal foils with a thickness of
20–100 lm.
ECN has developed for Tecnimont-KT in the framework of FISR project
described in Chap. 10 a module with 0.4 m2 of a few lm palladium membranes
with tubular geometry (Fig. 3.10).

3.4.2 MRT Hydrogen Separation Modules
MRT is a Vancouver-based private company interested in hydrogen puriﬁers to
provide high purity hydrogen and to recover hydrogen from mixed gas streams.
MRT produced membranes either as rolled foils or as deposited thin ﬁlms (8–
15 lm). In addition, patented bonding techniques have been developed to per-
manently attach membranes to support modules with a perfect, hydrogen-tight
seal.
For membranes thinner than 15 lm, MRT uses a proprietary coating technique.
Prototype membranes as thin as 8 lm, tested by MRT, have been produced and
show excellent performance and longevity.
The MRT Puriﬁer, developed for Tecnimont-KT in the framework of FISR
project, has been designed to house ﬁve membrane modules and operate at 450C
and up to 25 barg. Each module consists of two double sided, planar
30 cm 9 12 cm membrane panels welded in series. Each panel has a palladium
(Pd) alloy active membrane area of 0.03 m2 per side for a total installed membrane
area of 0.6 m2 in the puriﬁer. The modules are housed in a rectangular core which,
along with the inlet distributor, promotes uniform reformate ﬂow across the
membrane modules. The core assembly (Fig. 3.11) is housed inside a pressure
vessel.
3.4.3 Hydrogen Selective Membranes Produced in Japan
An important Japanese Company (JC) is developing a gas separation membrane,
which efﬁciently recovers hydrogen, by forming a ﬁlm on a porous ceramic
substrate using palladium alloy known for its feature of selective permeation of
hydrogen. The key is to simultaneously achieve cost effectiveness and high
hydrogen selectivity, by making expensive palladium membranes thinner.
At laboratory scale, the JC has realized Pd–Ag membranes on ceramic
substrates.
Fig. 3.11 MRT module

Hydrogen Palladium Selective Membranes
69
The membranes are produced in a three-step procedure: at ﬁrst, Pd is deposited
onto the Al2O3 support by electroless plating technique, and then Ag is layered on
by electroplating using the Pd layer as electrode. The layered Pd–Ag membrane is
ﬁnally heat-treated to obtain the Pd–Ag alloy membrane.
The resulting membranes are tubular with an external diameter of about 1.0 cm,
an effective length of about 9.0 cm and a Pd–Ag coating deposited on the external
surface with a selective layer of about 28.3 cm2.
JC has realized for Tecnimont-KT three tubular Pd–Ag membranes with a total
surface area of 0.12 m2 (Fig. 3.12).
3.4.4 SINTEF Hydrogen Selective Membranes
SINTEF, research and educational centre in the ﬁeld of environmentally tech-
nology, has developed a technique for the manufacturing of palladium-based
hydrogen separation membranes based on a two-step process allowing a reduction
of membrane thickness making palladium membranes economically viable. First, a
defect-free Pd-alloy thin ﬁlm is prepared by magnetron sputtering onto the ‘perfect
surface’ of a silicon wafer. In a second step, the ﬁlm is removed from the wafer.
These ﬁlms may subsequently either be used self-supported or integrated with
various supports of different pore size, geometry, and size (Fig. 3.13). This allows,
for example, the preparation of very thin (approximately 2–3 lm) high-ﬂux
membranes supported on macroporous substrates, which can operate at high
pressures. The efﬁciency of these membranes has been investigated by SINTEF at
elevated temperatures and pressures and reported in a remarkable number of
publications on scientiﬁc journals.
In pure H2, applying a H2 feed pressure of 26 bars, one of the highest H2 ﬂuxes
reported, 2477 ml cm-2 min-1 (STP) or 6.1 9 104 kg H2 m-2 h-1, which cor-
responds to a permeance of 1.5 9 10-2 mol m-2 s-1 Pa-0.5, was measured at
400C. In water gas shift (WGS) conditions (57.5% H2, 18.7% CO2, 3.8% CO,
1.2% CH4 and 18.7% steam), SINTEF membranes has shown a H2 permeance of

1.1 9 10-3 mol m-2 s-1 Pa-0.5 at 400C and 26 bar feed pressure. Operating the
membrane for more than 1 year under various conditions (WGS and H2 ? N2
mixtures) at 10 bars indicated no membrane failure. A membrane life time of
several (2–3) years (T B 425C) is assessed for the employed experimental con-
ditions based on these long-term stability tests. Post-process characterization
showed a considerable grain growth and of micro-strain relaxation in the Pd–
23%Ag membrane after the prolonged permeation experiment. Changes in surface
area are relatively small.
3.5 Membrane Manufacturing Strategy
To lower the production costs, it is important to develop a proper membranes
manufacturing strategy (MMS) which involves two main aspects:
• the manufacturing process itself which will give the business a distinct advan-
tage in the market-place through unique technology for instance;
Fig. 3.13 SINTEF membranes manufacturing process; a Pd-alloy ﬁlm prior to removal from the
silicon wafer; b unsupported Pd-alloy ﬁlm; c Pd-alloy ﬁlm during wrapping on the tubular porous

• manufacturing associated activities in terms of infrastructure design as controls,
procedures, subcontractors selection and so on that are involved in the main
process aspects of manufacturing.
3.5.1 Manufacturing Process
Based on our current understanding and experience in composite membrane, one
way to simplify the manufacturing process is to separate the Pd-based selective
layer preparation from the integration of it on the support. This has been dem-
onstrated by Bredesen and Klette [39] and shown in Sect. 3.4.4.
Moving ahead such a concept, the manufacturing process should consist of a
batch process on three independent steps. The choice of a batch process is a logical
one because it provides similar items on a repeat basis, usually in larger volume.
Batch procedure divides the manufacturing task into a series of appropriate
operations, which together will make the product involved. It is then not so dif-
ﬁcult to deﬁne the main steps in such a process: ﬁrst of all, the Pd-alloy selective
layer preparation, and secondly, the support preparation and ﬁnally the membrane
module assembling and testing.
One way to approach the membrane and support fabrication is to consider two
distinct lines, each one delivering the distinctive product, which at the end of the
process is tested for quality control before moving to the integration.
A roll-in process as proposed by Acktar, and detailed in Fig. 3.14, based on
vapor deposition could produce the thin Pd-alloy layer, meanwhile planar or

tubular PSS support can be bought on the market by a proper subcontractor and
coated with a ﬁne porous as metallic inter-diffusion barrier in order to realize the
membrane substrate.
Once the two single speciﬁc components have been prepared and tested, the
membrane can be formed by laying the membrane on the support. Several
membranes can be assembled together to build a module.
Because of the metal structure of the support, the proposed composite mem-
branes provide a solution to the problems that result from high welding temper-
atures or high mechanical compressing force caused by the joining of a composite
membrane with other parts through Swagelok, welding, brazing, and gasket, etc.
A ﬂat conﬁguration of the membranes provides solutions to the problems
associated with module assembling. For planar porous metal substrate, a solid
frame, useful for realizing the module sealing, can be welded to its perimeter.
3.5.2 Manufacturing-Associated Activities
The manufacturing task of choosing a process and necessary hardware is not
simply. Process choice concerns the features for hardware, the tangible ways in
which the products are manufactured; but the task is more than this.
The associated structures, controls, procedures, and other systems within
manufacturing are equal necessary for successful, competitive manufacturing
performance.
In our MMS, quality controls for instance related to the thin ﬁlms but also to the
support and the membrane overall, constitute an essential part in the manufac-
turing task. Creating a quality function in the organization to supervise such
operational controls is an essential key issue to develop and manage.
Fail to develop a proper infrastructure on the complex process of making
membranes may result in the impossibility to reach the target costs.
3.6 Membrane Costs Analysis and Dynamics
In order to tackle this issue and to be able to forecast a production cost for thin Pd-
based membranes, it is important to introduce the concept of ‘‘economics of
learning’’ in understanding the behaviour of all added costs of membranes as
cumulative production volume increased. Such economics of learning or law of the
experience may be expressed more precisely in an algebraic form:
cn ¼ c1na
ð3:2Þ
where c1 is the cost of the unit production (square meter of membrane for
instance), cn is the cost of the nth unit of production, n is the cumulative volume of
production, and a is the elasticity of cost with regard to output.

Graphically, the experience curve is characterized by a progressively declining
gradient, which, when translated into logarithms, is linear.
The size of experience effect is measured by the proportion by which costs are
reduced with subsequent doublings of aggregate production.
3.6.1 Plotting the Experience Curve for the Membrane Production
Constructing an experience curve is a simple matter once the data are available.
Of course for the Pd-based or ceramic membrane such dates are limited to minimal
surface (less than 1 m2), which can, however, be used as starting point of the
curve. The other issue associated with drawing an experience curve is that cost and
production data must be related to a ‘‘standard product’’, which is not the case due
to the fact that in the membrane technology no standard is yet emerged and there is
a lot of discussion on the membrane composition and preparation method, sup-
porting matrix and other mechanical and construction details.
It is, however, a fact that costs decline systematically with increases in
cumulative output.
The assumptions made in the following are:
c1 ¼ 50;000 €
a ¼ 0:25
where c1 value derived by Tecnimont-KT recent experience in building a pilot unit
(refer to Chap. 10), meanwhile the ‘‘a’’ factor was assumed as average value
typically between 20 and 30%.
Using such a data is possible to forecast the cost for m2 of membrane module
versus the cumulative value of production, expressed in terms of m2.
Table 3.1 and Fig. 3.15 show such data.
It is important to note that the cost of bought-in materials and components for a
few micron Pd membranes is around 700 € as expressed by ECN [40], and such
information ﬁts reasonably well on what was presented and indicated by some
authors [41].

3.6.2 Strategy Implication of the Experience Curve
From the drawn experience curve, some implications for the membranes market
business strategy can be extracted.
The ﬁrst and more important question to answer is when a 1,000,000 m2 of
membrane module cumulative production could be reached in order to have a unit
cost around 1.600 € per m2 of membrane.
In order to answer such a question, further considerations need to be developed,
to relate surface to membrane module to the H2 production and to the introduction
of such a new technology in the market.
On previous published data, Iaquaniello [42] was calculating for a open
membrane reactor architecture a surface of 1,000 m2 for an installed capacity of
10,000 Nm3/h of Hydrogen. The envisaged installed capacity in the hydrogen
market is today around 1 MM Nm3/h of capacity per year, which translated into a
production of 100,000 m2 of membrane year, once the new technology will
supersede the conventional one.
To derive the rate of membranes technology introduction in the market a
Volterra equation was considered:
x ¼ A
.
1 þ e Bx
ð
Þ


þ C
ð3:3Þ
where A, B, C are constants and x is the cumulative production.
Such equation, also called ‘‘S logistic curve’’ is used to describe a process with
a low growth which accelerate with time to seem an exponential growth. A 10-year
period (2012–2022) is considered to achieve 50% substitution in the conventional
market starting from 2012, which roughly implies that over the next decade half a
million of square meters of membranes modules could be produced. With such
cumulative production around year 2020, the membrane cost per m2 could reach

the target of 1.600 € per m2 and the overall market will have a size of 1 billion of €
per year.
The Fig. 3.16 represents the cumulative production coupled to the ‘‘S’’ curve.
The approach used to determine the growth of the membranes market, together
with the cumulative production does not, however, identify the real factors that
determine its dynamics.
As matter of fact, the experience curve combines four sources of costs reduc-
tion: learning, economics of scale, process innovation, and improved production
design.
Economics of scale, conventionally associated with manufacturing operations,
is probably the most important of these costs drivers and exists wherever as the
scale of production increases unit costs fall. A plant capacity has then an economic
sense if a minimum efﬁciency plant capacity is reached.
This will imply that to reach the required reduction in the membrane cost, not
only a few specialized technologies must emerge, but the production market will
be concentrated in few highly specialized production plants.
3.7 Conclusion
Only few companies are able to supply Pd-based membranes or membranes
‘‘modules’’; market is still limited at laboratory scale membranes or modules for
small pilot units.
A reasonable price within 1,500–2,000 € for m2 of thin Pd based membranes
and even less for Si or inorganic membranes could be reached at the end of next
decade only if a cumulative volume of production high enough is reached.
A ‘‘S’’ logistic curve was used to describe the substitution process of the
conventional technology.
A precondition for such behavior is the emerging of one or two technologies
which can sustain costs reduction based on economics of scale.
Physical vapor deposition technology to produce membranes on a roll-in pro-
cess and a metallic support is indicated by the authors as one of the more prom-
ising technology for such industrial mass production.

4.1 Reactors and Separators Modeling Strategies
Throughout the ages, engineers and researchers have understood the importance of
modeling and have faced the challenge of developing more and more accurate
algorithms. Thanks to the strong development of both software and hardware, the
computational loads of mathematical modeling have been increased in the years
and nowadays the behavior of reactors and all chemical and physical phenomena
occurring inside reaction environment can be evaluated in detail.
Practically, mathematical models are based on the conservation laws of mass,
energy and momentum, which lead to mass, energy and momentum balances. The
balances, together with transport and kinetics equations, form a set of equations
(ODE or PDE) whose solution gives the component concentrations, temperature
and pressure proﬁles inside the reactor. Mass and heat transport coefﬁcients,
reactants and products physical properties, catalyst efﬁciency factor and all
parameters appearing in model equations have to be expressed.
In a rigorous model formulation, radial and axial mixing should be taken into
account due to radial and gradients of compositions, pressure and temperature.
As an example, if the elementary reaction
4

ð4:1Þ
is carried out in a tubular ﬁxed bed reactor, the concentration of reactant
A decreases along the reactor as shown in Fig. 4.1. The concentration drop is due
to the reaction but at the same time the gradient associated to this proﬁle leads to a
mass ﬂux in the direction shown in the ﬁgure. This ﬂux would reduce the gradient
itself and its entity should be taken in consideration in reactor modeling.
Moreover, catalysts are typically porous and the concentration proﬁle of
reaction components inside the particles, shown in Fig. 4.2, should be taken into
account.
It is clear that a rigorous formulation of all phenomena occurring inside a
reaction environment leads to a level of complexity difﬁcult to be managed. The
ability of reactor designers is mainly in introducing proper assumptions which
reduce the formulation complexity but at the same time do not lead to unac-
ceptable approximations.
Therefore, various models types can be developed and applied in each speciﬁc
case.
In the following section, a classiﬁcation of ﬁxed bed reactor models is proposed
and a brief description of each model type is reported.
4.1.1 Fixed Bed Reactor Model Classiﬁcation
Mass, energy, and momentum local balances on a control volume are the basis of
each model. In cylindrical symmetry, as for tubular reactors, the control volume is
selected as shown in Fig. 4.3.

proﬁle in a tubular ﬁxed bed

Balances for a generic variable X (component mass, energy, momentum) are
expressed as follows:
Input rate of X through control volume surface
 Output rate of X through control volume surface
¼ Accumulation rate of X inside control volume
 Generation rate of X inside control volume
Input and output rates can be expressed as convective and diffusive terms,
where convective terms are always associated to a mass ﬂow while diffusive terms
are associated to molecules ﬂuxes. In reactors, X generation is due to reactions
inside the volume, whose effects are:
• increase of products composition,
• reduction of reactants composition,
• increase or reduction of reactor temperature due to reaction exothermicity or
endothermicity, respectively, and
• variation of ﬂuid volume in dependence on algebraic sum of reaction stoichi-
ometric coefﬁcients.

Accumulation term takes into account variations with time of reactor
conditions.
Fixed bed reactors are systems composed by two or more physical phases since
a ﬂuid phase reacts over a solid catalyst. Models can be grouped in two broad
categories:
• Heterogeneous models, by which the ﬂuid and solid phases are modeled sepa-
rately, imposing balance equations for each phase. Mass and heat ﬂuxes between
the solid and ﬂuid phases are expressed in terms of particle-to-ﬂuid mass and
heat transport coefﬁcients.
• Pseudo-homogeneous models. Fluid and solid phases are considered as a single
pseudo-phase and the balances are imposed for only one phase. Heat and mass
transport coefﬁcients inside the bed are calculated by expressions which account
for the simultaneous presence of two phases.
According to Froment–Bischoff [1] for each category, models can be classiﬁed
in order of their growing complexity, as reported in Table 4.1.
In the following, a survey of model typologies is reported starting from the
simplest ones and removing assumptions gradually to formulate more and more
complex models. Only steady-state conditions are taken into account. For a deeper
models description, please refer to [1–3].
4.1.1.1 Pseudo-Homogeneous Models
By pseudo-homogeneous models, ﬁxed bed reactors are described without con-
sidering the existence of two different phases at least, but imposing balance
equations for one single pseudo-phase and calculating chemical-physical proper-
ties and transport coefﬁcients by applying empirical expressions.
The pseudo-homogeneous assumption reduces the complexity of the model
implementation and resolution, but of course this model category gives less
accurate results with respect to heterogeneous one.
The simplest ﬁxed bed reactor model formulation is the pseudo-homogeneous
ideal model, by which:
1. ideal plug-ﬂow is imposed, assuming that compositions, temperature and
pressure vary only in the axial direction;

2. axial mixing is neglected, and the only transport mechanism is the axial con-
vective ﬂux.
Assuming the elementary reaction (4.1) in gaseous phase, the mass balance
equation for the ideal model is:
us
dCA
dz ¼ qBrA
ð4:2Þ
where z is the reactor axial coordinate, us is the gas superﬁcial velocity, assumed to
be constant along z since the reaction (4.1) occurs without mole variation and
neglecting the effects of temperature and pressure drop, CA is the concentration of
component A, qB the catalytic bed density, and rA the A-component reaction rate.
The term us
dCA
dz represents the axial convective ﬂux, while qBrA is the generative
term associated to the reaction.
Energy balance has the following form:

T  Tr

ð4:3Þ
where T is the reactor operating temperature, qg the gas molar density, cp the gas

cooling ﬂuid, U the overall heat transport coefﬁcient between the external and
reaction bed, dt the internal tubular reactor diameter. The term usqgcpdT
dz is heat
convective ﬂux, (-DH)qBrA is the generative term associated to the reaction and
4 U
dt T  Tr
ð
Þ is heat exchanging ﬂux between the reaction zone and the external.
The global heat transport coefﬁcient U is calculated from the sum of different
heat resistances in a series. For a packed bed reactor, the heat transport resistances
concern:
• the heat medium side;
• the tube wall;

pseudo-homogeneous phase, respectively, while Ai, Ao, and Am are the bed size
heat exchanging surface, the thermal ﬂuid heat exchanging surface and the log
mean of them.

Different expressions are reported in the literature to evaluate the effective
radial thermal conductivity ker [5] and the heat transport coefﬁcient in the ﬁrst
layer near the tube wall hW [6–9] for the pseudo-homogeneous ﬂuid/solid phase.

where P is the reaction pressure, f the friction factor, G the superﬁcial mass ﬂow
velocity, lg the gas mixture viscosity, dp the equivalent catalyst particle diameter,
and e the void fraction of the packed bed.
Equations 4.2, 4.3, and 4.5, with boundary conditions in the inlet section, are
the ODE set to be solved to calculate concentrations, temperature and pressure
proﬁles along the reactor axial coordinate.
Obviously, the ideal model is very simple and consequently solutions obtained
are approximate. Usually, this type of model is used only when a ‘‘ﬁrst tentative’’
solutions is required.
If a more accurate analysis of the phenomena inside the packed bed has to be
performed, some of ideal model assumptions has to be released.
First of all, the axial gradients of concentrations and temperature lead to back-
mixing effects and diffusive contributions to mass and heat transport, which bring
about axial gradients smoother than those obtained by an ideal model, have to be
included.
Taken as reference the mass balance, the Eq. 4.2 is modiﬁed as follows:
eDea
d2CA
dz2  us
dCA
dz ¼ qBrA
ð4:6Þ
where Dea is the effective axial diffusivity, usually calculated in terms of the axial
Pe number based on pellets diameter:
Pea ¼ ui  dp
Dea
ð4:7Þ
where ui is the interstitial velocity of the gas mixture. Pea value lies within the
range 0.5–2 [1].
In this kind of models second-order differential terms appear in mass, energy,
and momentum balances and two boundary conditions on the axial coordinate
have to be imposed. The set of differential equations together with the boundary
conditions represents a boundary value problem (BVP), since the constraints are
imposed at the inlet and at the outlet of the tubular reactor.
If radial variations are considered as well, the hypothesis of plug ﬂow and
consequently the one-dimensional nature of model equations falls through. Two-
dimensional models are usually required for energy balances in packed bed
reactors, since the scarce conductivity of packed bed leads to strong temperature
radial changes.

As an example, the mass and energy balances for a two-dimensional pseudo-
homogeneous packed bed reactor model are represented by the following

where axial mixing is neglected and radial convective term is negligible with

and thermal conductivity, respectively.
The set to be solved is composed by partial differential equations (PDEs), which
can be handled by different approaches, as the Finite Elements Method or the
Orthogonal Collocations.
4.1.1.2 Heterogeneous Models
For heterogeneous models, gas and solid phases are considered separately and
mass, energy, and momentum balances have to be imposed for both phases. This
approach has to be followed when:
• reactions are quick on the catalyst pellets surface, leading to large temperature
and concentration gradients between the gas bulk and the solid surface;
• thermal conductivities of gas and solid phases are very different.
If the system to be modeled veriﬁes one of these conditions at least, the het-
erogeneous approach has to be followed since a pseudo-homogeneous model
would lead to unacceptable errors.
The simplest heterogeneous model considers only the interfacial gradients
between solid and ﬂuid phases, imposing mass and energy balances for all phases
involved and introducing mass and heat transport from the gas bulk to catalyst
surface and vice versa. Typical mass and energy balances equations are:

where CS
A and TS are A-component concentration and temperature on catalyst
surface and Kg and hf are the mass and heat transport coefﬁcient between gas and
solid phase and a is the ratio between the area of the total external surface of
particles and the reactor volume. Reaction occurs on the catalyst surface and
reaction terms in the solid phase mass/energy balances, Eqs. 4.12, 4.13, have to be
calculated at the temperature and components concentrations on the particle sur-
face. The assumption made is that the catalyst is not-porous and ﬂuid components
cannot diffuse through solid material.
However, usually catalysts are porous materials to strongly increase the active
reaction area per unit of reactor volume. Therefore, the intra-particle gradients,
i.e., the mass and heat transfer inside the catalyst particle, have to be considered as
well. Fluid phase equations are the same as Eqs. 4.10, 4.11, while solid phase
equations have to be modiﬁed as follows:

ð4:15Þ
where CA,s and Ts are the concentration and temperature at the radial coordinate n
inside the solid particle, assumed to be spherical, directed from the center to the
external surface.
The terms De and ke are the effective diffusivity and thermal conductivity in the
solid particle: methods to calculate these coefﬁcients are reported in the literature
[1, 11].
A different approach to determine the intra-particle effect is based on the
effectiveness factor deﬁned as:
g ¼

where Vp is the pellet volume. Effectiveness factor is the ratio between the real
rate of reaction observed in the presence of pore diffusion resistance and the
rate of reaction that should be observed if the whole particle be at surface
conditions. Its value is within the range (0, 1) and it multiplies the rate of
reaction at surface conditions to consider the reduction of reaction rate due to
the diffusion resistance. Solid phase mass/energy, Eqs. 4.14 and 4.15, can be
simpliﬁed as follows:

The most comprehensive packed bed reactor model is formulated accounting
of:

• intra-particle gradients inside catalyst pellets;
• radial mixing, leading to a 2D formulation;
• axial mixing, even if such an effect could be usually neglected.

4.1.2 Pd-based Hydrogen Selective Membrane Modeling
4.1.2.1 Pd-based Membrane Permeability Deﬁnition
In modeling membrane reactors, a proper deﬁnition of membrane performance in
terms of hydrogen ﬂux is crucial. In fact, hydrogen permeation through selective
membranes is a leading phenomenon for membrane reactors, and errors in
assessing membrane behavior would lead to unreliable results.
In Chap. 2, H2 permeation mechanisms through selective membranes are
extensively reported. In this paragraph, the strategies to develop permeation
models for Pd-based membranes and experimental protocol to evaluate parameters
appearing in model equations are described.
As for the solution-diffusion mechanism, the hydrogen permeation through a
palladium layer is a complex process consisting of adsorption and dissociation of
hydrogen molecules, followed by diffusion of hydrogen atoms through the metal

lattice, recombination of hydrogen atoms at the low pressure side and desorption
of molecular hydrogen, according to the following 6-step activated mechanism
(see Fig. 4.4) [12]:
1. adsorption of hydrogen molecules on the high pressure side of the membrane
surface;
2. dissociation of the chemisorbed molecules into atomic H• species, consisting of
a proton and an electron;
3. dissolution of the hydrogen atoms H• (proton and electron) into the lattice of
the metal;
4. diffusion of the hydrogen atoms H• (proton and electron) through the lattice
from the high hydrogen pressure of the membrane side to the low hydrogen
pressure of the membrane surface;
5. re-combination of protons and electrons and re-association of two atomic H•
species with formation of hydrogen molecules H2 at the low hydrogen pressure
membrane surface;
6. desorption of hydrogen molecules from the low hydrogen pressure membrane
side to the bulk.
Depending on the thickness of the membrane, step 5 (diffusion of hydrogen
atoms through the lattice) results the controlling step in many cases. The diffusion
of hydrogen atoms through the lattice is ruled by the Fick’s law:
Fig. 4.4 Hydrogen

M. De Falco
J ¼ D  dcH
dx
ð4:23Þ
where J is the hydrogen ﬂux through the lattice, D is the hydrogen diffusion
coefﬁcient, and cH is the hydrogen concentration.
For thick membranes (thickness of tens lm), the dissociative chemisorption of
hydrogen on the membrane surface can be considered very fast compared with
diffusion of atomic hydrogen in the membrane. Thermodynamic equilibrium
conditions between hydrogen atoms dissolved at the surface of the membrane and
hydrogen in the gas phase can be assumed and the following relation between the
concentration of hydrogen atoms in Pd and the hydrogen partial pressure in the gas
phase is easily get:
cH ¼ S  p0:5
H2
ð4:24Þ
where S is the hydrogen solubility and pH2 the hydrogen partial pressure. The
exponent 0.5 accounts for the dissociation of the hydrogen molecules into
hydrogen atoms.
From Eqs. 4.23 and 4.24, the following equation can be derived for the
hydrogen ﬂux at constant temperature through a dense palladium membrane:
JH2 ¼ BH
d 
pn
H2;r  pn
H2;p


n ¼ 0:5
ð4:25Þ
where JH2 is the hydrogen ﬂux through the membrane, BH the hydrogen perme-
ability, d the membrane thickness, pH2;r and pH2;p the hydrogen partial pressures in
the retentate side (high hydrogen partial pressure) and in the permeate side
(low hydrogen partial pressure), respectively.
Experimental values of n have been determined in the range 0.5–1 [13]. When
n = 0.5, the hydrogen ﬂux follows the so-called Sieverts’ law which applies only
where the hydrogen to metal atomic ratio is quite small (H/Pd  1).
As for the inﬂuence of temperature on hydrogen permeability, the relationship
between the hydrogen permeation rate and the temperature can be described by the
Arrhenius law:
BH ¼ P0  exp  Ea
R  T


ð4:26Þ
where P0, Ea, R, and T are the pre-exponential factor, the apparent activation
energy, the universal gas constant, and the absolute temperature, respectively.
From Eqs. 4.25 and 4.26, we get the following expression to describe the H2
ﬂux through membrane in terms of membrane type, thickness and H2 partial
pressure driving force:

4.1.2.2 Membrane Permeability Experimental Apparatus and Procedure
In Eq. 4.27 there are two parameters to be evaluated by an experimental proce-
dure: P0 and Ea.
An experimental apparatus for membrane permeability tests is shown in
Fig. 4.5.
It is composed by:
• A mass ﬂow controller MFC1 to regulate the hydrogen feed;
• A ﬂow meter in the outlet permeation side to measure the permeated hydrogen
stream;
• Three pressure gages (PI) for measuring the pressure at inlet and outlet of the
membrane tube and at shell outlet (two pressure gages are assembled in the
lumen since the system is suitable for the membrane reactor testing as well, for
which a pressure drop evaluation is necessary);
• A shut-off valve (V1) on the hydrogen generator line while the throttle valve
(V2) on the retentate line allows adjusting the pressure inside the membrane.
• A remote-controlled heating system consisting of a platinum coil wire wrapped
around the membrane tube for assuring isothermal conditions. Thermocouples
(TI) monitor the temperature.
A permeator module, developed by Angelo Basile’s research group of
ITM-CNR, is schematized in Fig. 4.6.
Fig. 4.5 Scheme of membrane testing experimental apparatus
92
M. De Falco
The permeation tests are carried out by the following procedure:
1. the temperature is regulated by the remote-controlled heating system;
2. when the temperature of the system is stable, a hydrogen stream is sent into the
retentate side through the mass ﬂow controllers MFC1;
3. then, the pressure of the lumen (retentate side) is regulated by the throttle valve
(V2), while the pressure in the shell can be maintained at a ﬁxed pressure;
4. when the operating conditions are stable, the hydrogen ﬂow permeated through
the membrane is measured by the ﬂow meter.
Usually, the task of experimental phase is threefold:
1. veriﬁcation of the permeation mechanism according to the Sieverts’ law;
2. veriﬁcation of the Arrhenius type temperature dependence of the membrane
permeability;
3. evaluation of the permeability expression parameters.
About point 1, the scope is to verify if exponent n in Eq. 4.25 is equal to 0.5.
The following testing procedure has to be followed:
1. at a ﬁxed temperature, the permeated hydrogen ﬂux for various pressure dif-
ferences between shell and lumen is measured;
2. the data collected are reported as JH2 vs.

function;
3. if the data arrange on a line, the assumption of the Sieverts’ law validity is
veriﬁed.
The test should be repeated for three temperatures at least, in order to verify
Sieverts’ law within an operating temperature range.
Then, the Arrhenius type temperature dependence of membrane permeability
has to be veriﬁed as well, and at the same time the values of parameters P0 and Ea
have to be assessed. The experimental procedure is:
1. at a ﬁxed pressure difference between shell and lumen, the hydrogen permeated
ﬂux is measured for different operating temperature.

where A is a known constant. The Eq. 4.29 has to be linearized for the data

where:
B ¼  ln A  P0

3. The data collected are reported as  ln JH2

T. If the data arrange on a
straight line, the Arrhenius dependence on the temperature is veriﬁed and the
values of P0 and Ea can be derived from the slope and the intercept of the ﬁtting
straight line. Refer to Sect. 10.5.2 as an example of application for this
procedure.
At the end of the experimental procedure, a validated selective hydrogen
membrane permeability is available for membrane reactors modeling.
4.2 Integrated Membrane Reactor Models
In this section, strategies and equations used in membrane reactors modeling are
presented. A detailed model applied to natural gas steam reforming is reported in
Chap. 5.
An integrated membrane reactor (IMR) is usually composed by a tube, packed
with catalyst pellets, inside which one or more membrane modules are assembled
(Fig. 4.7). The catalyst could be also packed in the inner tube, but generally it is
preferred assembling the membrane in such a way that the higher pressure
(reaction pressure) is imposed outside membrane wall.
In order to study the reactor behavior, mass, energy, and momentum balances
have to be imposed for both reaction zone, where catalyst is packed and reactions
are promoted, and permeation zone, where an inert gas is sent to sweep the
hydrogen permeated through the selective membranes.
94
M. De Falco
Two conﬁgurations are possible (Fig. 4.8):
1. co-current conﬁguration, where reactants in the reaction zone and sweeping gas
in the permeation zone ﬂow in the same direction;
2. counter-current conﬁguration, where reactants and sweeping gas ﬂow in
opposite directions.
A potential alternative conﬁguration is the application of a vacuum pump in the
inner zone to reduce membrane downstream pressure, supporting hydrogen per-
meation without feeding a sweep gas.
In the following sections both one- and two-dimensional models are described.

4.2.1 One-Dimensional Model
For sake of simplicity, an ideal model is taken as example to approximately
describe the IMR behavior.
As aforementioned, mass, energy, and momentum balances have to be imposed
both in reaction and in permeation zone.
Reaction rate equation and all physical properties as heats of reactions, thermal
transport coefﬁcient, density of packed bed and ﬂuid mixture, ﬂuid mixture vis-
cosity, reactor and catalyst particles diameters, void fraction, etc., have to be
known for the speciﬁc system.
For the reaction zone, the equations of the model are the following ones:
Mass Balance (reaction zone):

for i = H2
ð4:33Þ
where ri and rH2 are reaction rates for i-component and for hydrogen, respectively.
JH2 is expressed according to Eq. 4.25 and Rmem is the selective membrane radius.
The term us is included in the derivative since in IMR the gas velocity can change
both for gas volume variation due to reactions and for hydrogen ﬂow outgoing
from the reaction environment through the selective membrane. Obviously,
hydrogen mass balance in reaction zone must include the hydrogen ﬂux leaving the
reaction environment thanks to selective membrane integration.

In Eq. 4.35 amem is the membrane thermal conductivity, dmem,i and dmem,o are
the internal and external membrane diameter, and hperm is the convective heat
transport coefﬁcient in the permeation zone.
In Eq. 4.34, the effect of enthalpy ﬂux associated to hydrogen outgoing from
the reaction zone through the membranes is neglected.
96
M. De Falco
Momentum Balance (reaction zone): In reaction zone, the momentum balance
can be expressed according to Eq. 4.5.
As for the permeation zone, balances are represented by following equations:

ð4:38Þ
where qg,perm and cp,perm are gas density and speciﬁc heat calculated at permeation
zone operating conditions, respectively. Likewise to reaction zone energy balance,
the enthalpy ﬂow leaving the reaction zone with the permeated hydrogen ﬂux is
neglected.
Momentum Balance (permeation zone): Usually, pressure drops in permeation
zone can be neglected. However, typical expressions are available for ﬂuids
ﬂowing in a tube, both in laminar and turbulent conditions, and could be applied.
The ODE set composed by Eqs. 4.32–4.34, 4.5, 4.36–4.38 can be solved by a
numerical procedure.
The following boundary conditions can be imposed:
z ¼ 0 :
usci ¼ usci

Counter-current configuration
Tperm ¼ Tperm;in

ð4:40Þ
In the case of co-current conﬁguration, ODE set is solved by a numerical
method with boundary conditions at inlet section (z = 0); if a counter-current
design has to be simulated, the problem is a BVP since boundary conditions for
reaction zone are imposed at inlet section (z = 0) while for permeation zone they
are imposed at outlet section (z = L). Different methods can be applied to solve
BVP; the most used one is the ‘‘shooting method’’ by which:
4
Membrane Reactors Modeling
97
1. permeation zone inlet conditions (z = 0) are assumed;
2. ODE set is solved;
3. if the real boundary conditions (4.40) are veriﬁed, the inlet boundary conditions
assumed at point 1 are the ﬁnal results, otherwise other boundary conditions
have to be imposed at point 1.
4.2.2 Two-Dimensional Model
Usually, IMR are characterized by marked compositions and temperature radial
proﬁles, which affect the reactor behavior. Therefore, the radial mixing effect
should be always considered in IMR modeling, and 2D model are certainly more
reliable and realistic.
A 2D pseudo-homogeneous model for IMR is presented here.
Usually, the radial diffusive transport term is taken into account for mass and
energy balances, while for momentum balance it could be neglected since the
presence of catalyst pellets produces a mixing effect leading to a uniform gas
velocity radial proﬁle. Moreover, the radial diffusive terms are always much
greater than the convective radial terms, which can be neglected.
For the reaction zone, mass and energy balances are Eqs. 4.8 and 4.9, with a gas
velocity term us generally dependent on axial coordinate and included in the
derivatives:

Finite Elements Method or the Orthogonal Collocations.
By the 2D mathematical model, axial and radial proﬁles both of components
concentrations and of reactor operating temperature can be calculated.
4.3 Modeling of Staged Membrane Reactor
Integrating selective membrane in a critical environment as a packed bed tubular
reactor could lead to a series of design, operating and maintenance problems.
Therefore, an alternative conﬁguration is analyzed in the present section. Hydro-
gen selective membrane is assembled in separation modules located downstream
to reaction units. This conﬁguration, called staged membrane reactor (SMR) and
shown in Fig. 4.9, is composed by a series of reaction-separation units: the
reactant feedstock is fed to the ﬁrst reactor where it is partially converted into
hydrogen; then hydrogen is recovered through a selective membrane separation
module, while the retentate is sent to the next step or recycled to the ﬁrst module.
Of course, it is possible to replicate the SMR until the desired reactant conversion
is achieved.
SMR conﬁguration is more deeply modeled and assessed in Chap. 5 for natural
gas steam reforming. Here, equations and boundary conditions of a model useful to
describe plant behavior are presented.

Both reactor and separation module have to be separately modeled, then they
are connected by boundary conditions.
The reactor model equations are those reported in Sect. 4.1.1, since a traditional
packed bed reactor has to be simulated.
Then, the stream leaving the reactor is fed to the separation module, which can
be modeled by the following equations (only mass balances are used):

4.4 Conclusions
Reactor mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for simulating the physical and
chemical phenomena occurring in a reactor. The improvement of hardware and
software allows reactor designers to work with more and more detailed and reli-
able algorithms, by which it is possible to understand behavior and performance
even before fabricating the reactor itself.
In the present chapter, membrane reactors modeling strategies have been pre-
sented, and various models of tubular ﬁxed bed reactors, Pd-based membrane
separators, IMR and SMR are reported and explained.
Different complexity levels can be applied, from ideal to much complex
structured models accounting for radial and axial mixing, intra-particle compo-
nents diffusion through catalyst particles, inter-facial gradients between solid and
ﬂuid phases. Of course, increasing the model complexity leads to more accurate
solutions but a growing computational effort is required: understanding which
assumptions can be made in each case without signiﬁcantly affecting results is one
of the most important designers’ skill.
For membrane reactors, many crucial phenomena have to be included, as
membrane permeability mechanism and hydrogen ﬂux, reactions kinetics, heat and
mass transport inside the reactor and from the external to the reactor. Therefore, a
proper simulation certainly requires a deep study and a careful evaluation and
deﬁnition of the system. The model developers have to work in a strict connection
with test drivers, since reliable model parameters and coefﬁcients deﬁnition is
crucial: designers can address reactors experimentation clarifying which infor-
mation from test-benches are required. At the same time, a proper model devel-
opment allows the number of experimental tests to be reduced drastically to those
ones required for a complete reactor validation.
By this chapter, the author does not pretend to run out a so wide topic as reactor
modeling and simulation but he wants only to give to readers the basis for a further
and deeper study.

5.1 Process Description
The total hydrogen produced today (65 million of tonnes per year) is mainly used in:
• chemical industry, as reactant for the ammonia and methanol synthesis, for the
hydrogenation of vegetable oil and as reductant to produce metals from their
oxides;
• in the reﬁnery processes as the hydrodesulfuration of sulfur compounds and
hydrocracking processes. The deteriorating quality of crude oils, the more
stringent petroleum product speciﬁcations, and environmental problems are
leading to larger needs of hydrogen in hydroprocessing.
Moreover, there is an increasing interest about hydrogen as energy carrier and
as feedstock for fuel cells, which further stimulates hydrogen industry.
Hydrogen can be obtained from different sources as fossil fuels (natural
gas reforming, and coal gasiﬁcation), renewable fuels (biomass), algae, and
vegetables or water (electrolysis and thermo-chemical cycles). Many different
energy sources can be used in most of these processes: heat from fossil fuel or
nuclear reactors, electricity from several sources as solar energy.
However, hydrogen production through steam reforming of natural gas (NG) is
undoubtedly the most applied process (48% of the total production), mainly for the
lower cost.
Figure 5.1 reports hydrogen cost based on production processes. It is a worth
assessment that:
• NG steam reforming produces the most cost-competitive hydrogen if the natural
gas price is not too high (
\
5 $/GJ).

• the cost of hydrogen produced by NG steam reforming is heavily dependent on
the feedstock price, since the NG is both the reactant and the fuel of the process.
For large plants, 70% of the production cost comes from the NG cost.
• obviously, a carbon tax will inﬂuence the cost of the hydrogen produced using
NG and carbon, making more competitive biomass gasiﬁcation and electrolysis.
Nowadays, NG steam reforming appears to be the only process able to produce
large amounts of hydrogen at a competitive cost and to promote hydrogen tech-
nologies in the next years.
However, some uncertainty comes from the volatility of natural gas price (spot
prices can double or triple in a short period of time) that affects the total cost of
hydrogen production for a half.
Although the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration
forecasts natural gas prices to rise slowly till 2025 (see Fig. 5.2), the future is even
less certain after 2025.

The assumption of a natural gas composed by only methane is made. However,
usually heavier hydrocarbon (ethane, propane, etc.) are cracked as the feedstock
goes into the reactor tanks to the high process operating temperature (Fig. 5.3).

The ﬁrst reaction is the steam reforming reaction (SR), which is an endothermic
reaction thermodynamically promoted at high temperature and low pressure. The
second reaction is known as water–gas shift reaction (WGS), an exothermic
reaction favored at low temperature and not affected by the operating pressure.
Globally the steam reforming process should be supported by high temperature
(in the steam reformer the task is the conversion of the methane, the WGS is
supported by one or two steps water–gas shift reactor which follow the steam
reformer, as described in the next paragraph) and by low pressure. However,
usually the reactions are conducted at 25–40 bar in industrial plants to reduce the
total volume of the devices and favor the heat transfer (Fig. 5.4).
Beyond the operating temperature and pressure, another important process
variable is the steam to carbon ratio (S/C), deﬁned as the ratio between the steam
ﬂow rate to the methane ﬂow rate in the reactor feedstock (Fig. 5.5). On the basis
of SR reaction stoichiometry S/C should be 2, but ratios greater than the stoi-
chiometric value promotes the reactions and reduces the possibility of coke for-
mation on the catalyst. In industry, the ratio is usually within the range 2.5–6 [1].
The effect of the temperature, pressure, and steam to carbon ratio on the
thermodynamic equilibrium for the reactions 5.1 and 5.2 is reported in the fol-
lowing [2], where methane conversion XCH4 and carbon dioxide yield XCO2 are
expressed according to:

5.1.2 Process Scheme
Because of the strong reactions endothermicity, steam reforming process is carried
out by supplying a high heat ﬂux. Two alternatives are available:
1. tubular ﬁred reforming (see Fig. 5.6);
2. autothermal reforming.
In tubular ﬁred reforming, process heat duty is supplied by burning a share of
NG feedstock in burners placed at top, down, or sideways of a furnace. In auto-
thermal reformers, a part of NG feedstock is directly burned in the ﬁrst section of
the reactor by adding an oxygen or enriched air stream and heat duty is supplied
without any external source.
The autothermal process, described in Chap. 6, is competitive with tubular ﬁred
reforming only for large applications as GTL plants or if oxygen or enriched air
are available at low cost since the use of natural air for methane combustion would
not allow the high temperature required by reactions to be reached.

A typical ﬂow-sheet of the tubular ﬁred steam reforming process is shown in
Fig. 5.7.
Natural gas is mixed with appropriate amounts of steam and recycled hydrogen
before entering the reformer reactor. The recycle of an amount of H2 produced is
necessary to keep the catalyst in the early part of the reformer tubes in the reduced
(active) state.
Reactions 5.1 and 5.2 occur in parallel in the steam reformer: the high tem-
perature of the reactor, placed in a furnace, supports the steam reforming reaction
to detriment of the WGS.
The hot syngas produced, composed by CH4, H2O, H2, CO, and CO2, is used to
generate very high pressure (VHP) steam for mixing with the feed (internal use)
and for ‘‘export’’ outside the unit. The cooled syngas is sent to a water gas shift
converter: generally, the operating temperature is about 400–450C to support the
reaction kinetics over the iron oxides catalyst.

KT)

M. De Falco
The H2-rich exit stream from the shift converter is cooled to condensate the
steam, producing the water recycled into the water boilers.
Then, the H2 is separated from the off-gases (CH4, CO, CO2) in a pressure
swing adsorption (PSA) section, which involves the adsorption of impurities onto a
ﬁxed bed of adsorbents at high pressure. The impurities are subsequently desorbed
at low pressure into an off-gas stream. This operation allows an extremely pure
hydrogen to be reached: H2 purities over 99.999% can be achieved.
Off-gases, mixed with additional fuel, are sent to the burners to supply a part of
the process heat duty.
If CO2 sequestration is required for environmental reasons, a Methyl-Di-
Ethanol-Amine (MDEA) unit has to be inserted to absorb the carbon dioxide and
to separate it from the other off-gas mixture components.
The global efﬁciency of the traditional steam reformer plants, calculated as the
ratio between the net heat value of the hydrogen stream produced and the total
process heat duty requirement (reactor heat duty, steam generation, pre-heating of
the reactant mixture, PSA, and MDEA) is typically within the range 65–85%,
depending on the plant size.
5.1.3 Traditional Steam Reforming Process Drawbacks
The main steam reforming process drawbacks are:
• a signiﬁcant fuel consumption to heat up the reactor. Methane unconverted in
the reactor plus an additional methane stream have to be burnt to supply the heat
required by reactions: the average heat ﬂux between the oven and the catalyst
packed bed is about 80 kW/m2 for tubular ﬁred reactors; therefore for each tube
of the reforming reactor, 10 m long and with a diameter of 10 cm, the heat duty
is about 250 kW. Considering that in a traditional industrial plant hundreds of
parallel tubes are installed, the total heat duty is some tens of MWth. Moreover,
the high NG fuel consumption is the main reason of the strong dependence of
the ﬁnal H2 cost on the NG market price (Fig. 5.1) and of the consequent large
uncertainty on the expected H2 production cost.
• strong mechanical stresses on reformer tubes due to the high temperature with
large thermal gradient in the axial direction. The high operating temperature
forces to use expensive high alloy steels whereas the large thermal gradient in
axial direction, together with the pressure (25–30 bar) in the tube, produce hard
stresses on materials.
• the use of a furnace requires a good operational experience.
• the scarce catalyst effectiveness, mainly due to the small contact surface
between active solid and reactant gas and to the high resistance of the material
to the diffusion of the reactant into the particle. Reducing the pellets size should
improve the effectiveness factor but particle dimension cannot be too small,
5
Membrane Integration in Natural Gas Steam Reforming
109
since an excessive packing of the catalyst reduces the bed void fraction and
increases pressure drops, which are usually important (2–3 barg).
• the high heat transport resistance of the packed bed, which causes a strong
reduction of packed bed temperature and of methane conversion. As it is widely
reported in literature, the random distribution of the pellets in the packed bed is
characterized by a high void fraction in the zone near the tube wall, moreover
which is a rigid boundary inhibiting lateral gas mixing. Consequently, in the
zone near the hot tube wall the molecular conduction is the only heat transfer
mechanism, causing a strong temperature drop immediately in the ﬁrst layer of
the gas-catalyst phase. Then, the heat ﬂux encounters the high heat transport
resistances of the gas mixture and of the catalytic pellets. Catalyst particles
placed in the central zone of industrial large reformers usually do not work well
since the temperature is too low for promoting the endothermic reactions.
• no water–gas shift conversion in the steam reformer. The very high temperature
reached in the traditional steam reforming reactor changes the direction of the
exothermic water–gas shift. Therefore, in the traditional steam reforming
industrial plants, the reformer is followed by a water–gas shift reactor to reduce
the carbon monoxide contents in the outlet stream.
5.2 Membrane Integration
Natural gas steam reforming process is an ideal candidate for hydrogen selective
membrane integration tanks to its high reaction endothermicity and the fast
kinetics leading to equilibrium condition inside traditional reactors.
The selective membrane integration allows a reaction product to be removed
and equilibrium conditions are never reached. As a result, a speciﬁc feedstock
conversion can be obtained at a lower operating temperature with the main beneﬁts
of a better heat integration, as the use of gas exhausts from a gas turbine as
suggested by [3] or solar heated molten salts [4, 5].
By membrane integration, the design criteria of steam reforming plant have to
be completely re-thought, carefully facing the membrane integration drawbacks,
mainly coupling catalyst and membrane operating conditions and meeting a
compromise optimization to promote both kinetics and permeability, without
damaging the membrane which always requests a stringent thermal threshold.
Two plant conﬁgurations can be used:
1. the selective membrane is assembled directly inside the reaction environment,
so that the hydrogen produced by reactions is immediately removed (MR
concept);
2. the hydrogen selective membrane is assembled in separation units located
downstream to reaction units. This conﬁguration, called Reformer and Mem-
brane Module (RMM), is composed by a series of reaction-separation modules.
110
M. De Falco
Both conﬁgurations are described in the following paragraphs. MR is then
modeled and simulated to assess the effects of operating conditions on reactor
behavior, while for a description of a real RMM installation refer to Chap. 10.
5.2.1 Membrane Reactor Concept
A membrane reactor (MR) is a compact device in which a selective membrane is
directly assembled. The simplest conﬁguration is composed by two concentric
tubes, where catalyst pellets are packed in the annular zone while the inner tube is
the membrane itself, as shown in Fig. 5.8. Through the inner tube a sweeping gas
(water steam) is sent, co-currently or counter-currently, to drag the hydrogen
permeated. Of course, the membrane integration can also be made by assembling
many smaller tubes, thus increasing the speciﬁc membrane surface per unit volume
of reactor and consequently the overall hydrogen ﬂow permeating. Two different
zones can be recognized: the reaction zone, which is the annular section where
catalyst is packed, and the permeation zone, where the sweeping gas is sent.
Many experimental works reported in the literature [7–15] attest the good
performance in terms of natural gas conversion at much lower operating tem-
perature than in traditional process (methane conversions up to 90–95% at 450–
550C vs. 850–1000C).
Moreover, the MR conﬁguration avoids packing catalyst in the central zone of
the tubular reactor, thus improving the average catalyst effectiveness.
Furthermore, the lower operating thermal level required in MR leads to new
procedures of process heat duty supply, avoiding the furnace and allowing hot
ﬂuids from other processes or solar thermal ﬂuids [4, 5] to be used.
Membranes that can be used in MRs are:
1. dense metallic membranes, mainly Pd-based membrane, characterized by a
very high hydrogen selectivity (almost inﬁnite);
2. ceramic membranes, as silica membranes, with a stronger resistance to thermal
stresses but lower hydrogen selectivity.
In modeling and simulating MR, Pd-based membranes are selected in this
chapter to exploit their very high selectivity and because their development is at a
pre-commercial status. For typical Pd-based selective membrane performance,
Fig. 5.8 Membrane reactor draft [6]
5
Membrane Integration in Natural Gas Steam Reforming
111
refer Table 2.3, where permeation data of different palladium–alloy membranes
are reported.
The main criticism in membrane reactors is the need to impose the same
operating conditions for membrane and catalyst, while:
• the catalyst has to operate at high temperature, to promote kinetics and avoid
carbon coke formation reactions;
• the membrane must work below a thermal threshold (about 500C for a reliable
durability), to avoid stability problems due to stresses between active Pd layer
and ceramic or SS support.
In Sect. 5.3 MR is modeled, simulated, and optimal operating conditions are
assessed.
5.2.2 Reformer and Membrane Modules
In order to avoid the conﬂict of catalyst and membrane operating parameters, the
selective membrane can be placed outside the reactor, in proper units located
downstream. This is the concept of Reformer and Membrane Modules (RMM)
steam reforming plant [3, 6, 16], shown in Fig. 5.9.
The feed is sent to a convective steam reformer where it is partially converted
into hydrogen; then hydrogen is recovered through a Pd alloy membrane separa-
tion module, while the retentate is sent to the next step or recycled to the ﬁrst
module. By means of a heat recovery system, the operating temperature can be
reduced to about 450C before the membrane unit and again increased before the
second reactor. It is possible to replicate the RMM until the desired natural gas
conversion is achieved.
Fig. 5.9 Two reformer and membrane modules process scheme [6]
112
M. De Falco
The main beneﬁts of such a conﬁguration are:
– the possibility to decouple reaction and separation operating conditions.
Reforming and separation module temperatures can be optimized indepen-
dently, both increasing methane conversion for each reaction step and mem-
brane stability and durability.
– a simpler mechanical design of membrane tubes in comparison with the case of
tubes embedded in catalyst; a simple ‘‘shell and tube’’ geometry can be selected
for the tubular separation module.
– simpliﬁcation of membrane modules maintenance and of catalyst replacement.
On the other hand, the main drawbacks in respect to MR conﬁguration can be
summarized as follows:
– the lower compactness of the plant: RMM conﬁguration is composed by reac-
tors, separation modules and heat exchangers between them, while in MR
reaction and separation are performed in a single compact device.
– the membrane surface area required for the same methane conversion is greater
in RMM conﬁguration. This leads to a greater cost.
A RMM test plant with a capacity of 20 Nm3/h of hydrogen and constructed in
Chieti (Italy) by Italian process contractor Tecnimont-KT is presented in Chap. 10.
Performance of such an innovative architecture is evaluated in a real pre-industrial
application.
5.3 Membrane Reactor Performance
In order to simulate the behavior of an industrial membrane reactor, the model
described in Sect. 4.2.2, i.e., a two-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous model, is
ﬁtted to natural gas steam reforming. Chemical–physical properties of reactions
and components involved are taken from literature [17, 18] as functions of
temperature, pressure, and mixture composition. The kinetic equations for the
reactions scheme composed by 5.1, 5.2 and the overall reaction:
CH4 þ 2H2O , CO2 þ 4H2
ð5:5Þ
are taken from Xu-Froment [19].
The model is implemented in MatLab environment. The validation is made on
the basis of industrial data sets [20] of a traditional steam reforming plant. Fig-
ure 5.10 reports the comparison between industrial and simulated data, attesting a
good adherence [2].
Then, the dependence of membrane permeability on the temperature, given by
Shu [7] and valid for a 20 lm Pd–Ag membrane, has been assumed and hydrogen
down and upstream partial pressures (see Eq. 4.27) are ﬁxed. The conﬁguration
depicted in Fig. 5.7 is assumed.

The operating conditions used in simulations are reported in Table 5.1 and are
close to those ones of a potential industrial application; therefore reactor dimen-
sions are similar to those of traditional reactors [20].
The following simulations are performed ﬁxing the MR geometry and the
permeation zone operating conditions and varying:
1. external wall temperature TW;
2. inlet methane ﬂow rate;
3. steam to carbon ratio;
4. pressure driving force between reaction and permeation zones, i.e. the operating
pressure of reaction zone.

M. De Falco
In evaluating the effect of the aforementioned operating conditions, a com-
parison with a traditional reactor with the same geometry is always made, to
quantify the performance improvement by MRs.
Reactor performance is evaluated as:
• methane conversion
• pure hydrogen ﬂow rate recovered through selective membrane (Nm3/h)
Moreover, it is assumed that the outlet ﬂow rate, composed by un-reacted
methane, un-permeated hydrogen, CO, and CO2, and therefore characterized by a
great energy content, is sent to a gas turbine for electricity generation.
The simulations are performed for a single MR reactor.
5.3.1 Effect of Wall Temperature
As shown in Figs. 5.11 and 5.12, wall temperature of the external tube has a strong
positive effect on MR performance for two main reasons:
1. reactions are promoted at higher temperatures;
2. membrane permeability increases at higher temperatures.
The beneﬁts of integrating a selective membrane inside the reaction environ-
ment are self-evident: in the range of explored temperatures, the improvement of
Fig. 5.11 Methane conversion in MR and TR versus wall temperature (reactor operating
pressure = 15 bar, S/C = 3, inlet methane ﬂowrate = 4 kmol/h)
5
Membrane Integration in Natural Gas Steam Reforming
115
methane conversion in MR is within the range 38–46% in comparison with TR
(Fig. 5.11).
Figure 5.12 shows that H2 produced and recovered increases as well with the
wall temperature but the output energy produced decreases since the amount of
fuel sent to the gas turbine is lower.
On the other hand, increasing wall temperature leads to an increase of maxi-
mum membrane temperature as well. At Tw = 873 K, the membrane reaches a
temperature of 830 K, while at 823 K the maximum temperature is 790 K. For this
reason, the wall temperature, and consequently the heat ﬂux supplied, has to be
limited to avoid the overtaking of Pd-based membrane temperature threshold,
ﬁxed at 800 K with the present technology. Therefore, the wall temperature has to
be maintained at values lower than 823 K.
5.3.2 Effect of Residence Time
Figure 5.13 shows the effect of residence time on MR behavior.
The residence time is calculated as the ratio between the catalyst packed vol-
ume and the inlet volume ﬂow rate of reactants.
The advantage of MR in comparison with TR is greater at lower Gas Hourly
Space Velocity (GHSV). The reason is that at high GHSV the residence time is too
low compared to the characteristic time of permeation kinetics, and the hydro-
gen recovery percentage, i.e., the ratio between the pure hydrogen recovered
Fig. 5.12 Pure H2 produced and recovered and energy of outlet stream (to be used for electricity
generation) versus wall temperature (reactor operating pressure = 15 bar, S/C = 3, inlet
methane ﬂowrate = 4 kmol/h)
116
M. De Falco
downstream and the total hydrogen produced, is low: 74.5% at 3,150 h-1 and
25.4% at 18,850 h-1.
Pure hydrogen produced has not a monotonic trend, since GHSV has a double
effect:
1. an increase of GHSV means an increase of reactant ﬂow rate and thus an
increase of hydrogen produced at a given conversion.
2. as shown in the ﬁgure, the increase of GHSV leads to a reduction of conversion
and recovery ratio, which causes a reduction of hydrogen produced and
permeated.
At low GHSV the ﬁrst effect is leading, while at higher values of GHSV the
second effect prevails.
Globally, if the GHSV value corresponding to the maximum pure hydrogen
recovery is taken as optimal, the beneﬁts of MR compared to TR are not enough to
justify membrane integration (methane conversion improvement of 14.3%).
Therefore, the optimal value can be taken equal to 6,000–6,500 h-1.
5.3.3 Effect of Steam-to-Carbon Ratio and of Pressure
Driving Force
In Figs. 5.14 and 5.15, the effects of steam-to-carbon ratio and of reaction oper-
ating pressure on methane conversion and pure H2 production are reported.
Fig. 5.13 Methane conversion in MR and TR and pure H2 recovered through membrane versus
inlet methane hourly space velocity (reactor operating pressure = 15 bar, S/C = 3, wall
temperature = 823 K)
5
Membrane Integration in Natural Gas Steam Reforming
117
High values of steam-to-carbon ratio improve reaction conditions, as the
increase of methane conversion both for MR and TR shows (Fig. 5.14).
On the other hand, steam-to-carbon ratio has a double effect on permeation
behavior:
1. high methane conversion, and consequently high hydrogen partial pressure in
the reaction zone, should lead to an improvement of permeation rate;
2. a high ﬂow rate of steam leads to a reduction of hydrogen partial pressure,
making worse the permeation performance.
Globally, at low pressure the negative effect is prevailing, while at higher
pressure the two effects are balanced (Fig. 5.15).
Also the pressure has a double effect on MR behavior:
1. it has a negative effect on reactions thermodynamics, leading to a reduction of
equilibrium conversion;
2. it increases the pressure driving force, improving the membrane performance
and consequently the pure H2 recovery.
Altogether, it is a worth assessment that high pressure enhances the advantage
of MR over TR, since the selective membrane works better.
A pressure of 10 bars and a steam-to-carbon ratio of 4 seem to be a good
compromise for reaction and permeation performance.

5.3.4 MR Optimal Conﬁguration
On the basis of previous simulations, the operating conditions reported in
Table 5.2 are considered to be optimal.
Performing simulations at these conditions, the following outputs are obtained:
• methane conversion = 34.9% (improvement over TR is 22%)
• pure hydrogen produced = 49 Nm3/h
• pure hydrogen recovered percentage = 40%
• output energy to turbo gas = 692 Mcal/h, able to produce 241 kWel with the
assumption of gas turbine electricity conversion efﬁciency of 0.3.
Figure 5.16 shows the temperature map inside MR reaction zone.
It has to be noticed the ‘‘cold spot’’ in the ﬁrst reaction section, due to the high
endothermicity of the steam reforming reaction, remarkable mainly where the
reactant concentration is higher and reactions are faster.
Temperature radial gradient is never greater than 20 K, while in TR its values
are much higher (up to 50–60C).

Membrane Integration in Natural Gas Steam Reforming

On the basis of the single reactor productivity, 205 compact MRs are needed for
an industrial plant able to produce 10,000 Nm3/h of pure hydrogen without
requiring any H2 puriﬁcation unit downstream the reactors system.
5.4 Future Perspectives
Membrane reactor technology is certainly a promising process intensiﬁcation
solution which should lead to crucial beneﬁts toward a more efﬁcient steam
reforming process conduction.
The reduction of operating temperature drives the plant designers to ﬁnd new
and better solutions to supply heat duty to steam reforming reactors, exploiting, for
example, heat streams from other parts of industrial plants.
Moreover, it has to be mentioned the possibility to couple the steam reforming
process with gas-turbine ﬂue gas [3] or with a solar source, considering that the
lowered process thermal level is coherent with the most recent and innovative
solar technologies, as molten salts Concentrating Solar Power plant [21–26], able
to heat a molten salt stream up to 550C by means of parabolic mirrors which
concentrate solar energy on the focal line. The hot molten salt energy can be
exploited to produce hydrogen by a steam reforming MR, as reported in [4].

On the other hand, the main criticism in steam reforming membrane reactors is
the necessity to impose the same operating conditions for membrane and catalyst,
whereas the catalyst should be at high temperature due to reactions endothermicity
while membrane temperature must not exceed a threshold for assuring its stability.
Considering that for the present technology the thermal limit for Pd-based selective
dense membrane has to be imposed at values lower than 800 K, the MR perfor-
mance is limited as well. Calculations reported in this chapter show that, at
industrial operating conditions, methane conversion in MRs is limited at 35% about.
The technological development of Pd-based membrane is crucial for a wide
diffusion of membrane reactors. R&D efforts have to be focused mainly on
increasing membrane temperature threshold, on improving the adherence between
the active layer and the support by new deposition and welding techniques, and on
improvement of membrane reliability to produce objects suitable for industrial
applications.
Future improvements of membrane performance would certainly promote the
applications of MRs, but the current membrane state-of-the-art leads to the con-
clusion that RMM plant seems to be more suitable for industrial applications due
to decoupling of reaction and separation operating conditions.

There are three primary techniques used to produce hydrogen or syngas from

Each of this process shows several advantages and challenges. Steam reforming
is an endothermic reaction, therefore, it requires an external heat source but it does
not require oxygen. Furthermore, it produces the reformate with the highest H2/CO
ratio (3) and is the typical preferred process employed in industry for hydrogen
production. In partial oxidation, using a substoichiometric amount of oxygen or
air, a partial or incomplete combustion of the fuel occurs. The reaction can be
carried out in the presence or the absence of a catalyst. In the non-catalytic process
higher temperatures must be reached to obtain complete CH4 conversion, however,
the advantage is that fuel components such as sulphur compounds do not need to
be removed, thus much heavier petroleum fractions can be processed making this

reaction more attractive for processing diesel, logistic fuels and residual fractions
cuts. The reaction is characterized by a H2/CO ratio of 2 which may be suitable for
Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.
Autothermal reforming is a stand alone process which combines partial oxi-
dation and steam reforming in a single reactor. The ATR process was ﬁrst
developed in the late 1950s by Topsøe mainly for synthesis gas production in
ammonia and methanol plants [4]. The hydrocarbon feedstock is reacted with a
mixture of oxygen or air and steam in a sub-stoichiometric ﬂame. In the ﬁxed
catalyst bed the synthesis gas is further equilibrated. The composition of the
product gas is determined by the thermodynamic equilibrium at the exit pressure
and temperature, through the adiabatic heat balance based on the composition and
ﬂows of the feed, steam and oxygen added to the reactor. The produced synthesis
gas is completely soot-free [5].
An ATR reactor consists of a thermal or combustion zone and a catalytic one.
In the ﬁrst zone part of the feed is partially oxidized, generating the heat needed to
drive the downstream steam reforming reactions in the catalytic zone. By proper
adjustment of oxygen to carbon and steam to carbon ratios the partial combustion
in the thermal zone supplies the heat for the subsequent endothermic steam
reforming reaction [6]. This characteristic makes peculiar the temperature proﬁle
in an ATR reactor. Indeed, the catalyst bed-temperature rises rapidly near the
reactant inlet end of the bed, and then gradually decreases, as result of a sequential
reaction mechanism involving the initial exothermic oxidation reactions of
methane, followed by the strongly endothermic steam reforming reaction [7–15],
as well as the mildly exothermic water gas shift reaction (6.4):
CO þ H2O ¼ CO2 þ H2

Unlike the steam reformer the autothermal one requires no external heat source
and no indirect heat exchangers. This makes autothermal reformers simpler and
more compact than steam reformers, resulting in lower capital cost. Furthermore,
autothermal reformers typically offer higher system efﬁciency than partial oxida-
tion systems, where the excess heat is not easily recovered. The autothermal
reforming reaction is carried out in the presence of a catalyst, which controls the
reaction pathways and thereby determines the relative extents of the oxidation and
steam reforming reactions. Therefore, in order to achieve the desired conversion
and product selectivity an appropriate catalyst is essential.
Catalyst formulations for ATR are strongly dependent on the selected fuel and
the operating temperature. A good catalyst has to be simultaneously active for
hydrocarbon oxidation and steam reforming reactions, to be robust at high tem-
perature for extended times of operations and to be resistant to sulphur poisoning
and carbon deposition, especially in the catalytic zone that runs oxygen limited [16]
and in particular, with hydrocarbon feed heavier than methane. Finally, it must be
resistant to intermittent operation and cycles, especially on start-up and shut-down
steps. The preferred catalyst for ATR is a low loaded nickel-based catalyst sup-
ported on alumina (a-Al2O3) and magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl2O4) since
spinel has a higher melting point and in general a higher thermal strength and
124

stability than alumina [2]. Other supports such as CeO2, ZrO2 or CeO2–ZrO2,
c-Al2O3 have been also suggested [17–23]. Pt-, Rh-, Ru- and Pd-based catalysts are
also used for ATR, in particular with feed different from methane [24–39]. Alter-
native catalyst formulations for methane ATR based on bimetallics have been
studied [40, 41] because the activity of nickel catalysts can be increased by the
addition of low contents of noble metals [42–47]. Furthermore, in recent years,
research into catalysts for ATR of hydrocarbons has paid considerable attention to
systems with a perovskite structure of general formula ABO3 [48–52], which are
strong candidates as precursors of reforming catalysts due to the possibility of
obtaining well-dispersed and stable active metal under the reaction conditions.
For small scale units providing hydrogen for fuel cells the choice of the optimal
technology may be dictated by parameters such as simplicity and fast transients
response, in particular for automotive applications. For these reasons, even if the
steam reforming process may be most energy efﬁcient in industrial process, cat-
alytic partial oxidation or autothermal reforming using air may be the preferred
choice for small scale or distributed hydrogen production [53]. As discussed by
Ahmed and Krumpelt [54], the lower temperature provides many beneﬁts such as
less complicated reactor design and lower reactor weights, due to less thermal
integration, less fuel consumption during the start-up phase, wider choice of
materials thus reducing the manufacturing costs in small scale applications.
The optimization of the structure of the catalyst support is also important. Due to
the severe operating conditions (high temperature and high ﬂow rates), typical of
short contact time reactions, heat and mass transfer properties are expected to play
a decisive role in the behaviour of the reactor [55]. Structured monolith or foam-
shaped catalysts show several advantages over pellet catalysts, the most important
one being the low-pressure drop associated with the high ﬂow rates that are usual
in environmental applications. Since structured catalysts can operate at signiﬁ-
cantly higher space velocities than pellets bed reactors, the consequent reduction in
reactor size saves both cost and weight. A secondary beneﬁt of having a smaller
reactor to be heated is that a rapid thermal response to transient behaviour can be
achieved. Whether the application is a load-following stationary fuel cell or an
on-site hydrogen generator stepping up from standby mode to full operation, the
reactors need to be able to respond quickly to changes in temperatures and ﬂow
rates [56]. Furthermore, in traditional fuel processor, after the reforming reactor
there is a section devoted to syngas cleaning from CO which, in particular when
the end-use technology is a PEM fuel cell, is a poison. Thus, to obtain a pure
hydrogen stream several further stages such as water gas shift, methanation, CO
preferential oxidation, membrane separation are necessary. However, when the
ﬁnal target is a reduced fuel processor size, a possible solution is the integration of
the syngas production and puriﬁcation units in the same reactor, employing a H2
membrane selective. Applying an H2 membrane to an ATR reactor can simplify
the process for pure hydrogen production, and in the meantime can promote
methane conversion into hydrogen. As CH4 is a stable hydrocarbon, high reaction
temperatures, around 800C, are required for the endothermic reforming reaction.
If H2 is selectively and continuously removed from the reaction system,

the equilibrium limitations of a conventional reactor can be circumvented, shifting
the thermodynamic product distribution of steam reforming and CO shift reactions
to the product sides, and highly efﬁcient conversion of CH4 to H2 and CO2 can be
attained at a much lower operating temperature than in a conventional reactor [57].
However, the typical ATR temperature proﬁle with large temperature excursions
close to the catalyst bed inlet makes its integration with a Pd-based membrane very
difﬁcult, due to poor thermal–mechanical stability of these membranes.
This chapter reports on the integration of a kW-scale CH4-ATR reactor,
developed at the University of Salerno, with a membrane for hydrogen separation.
The chapter focuses attention on the careful and proper procedures and operations
to be implemented in order to carry out the integration avoiding the membrane
damage. Over the last years several activities relevant to methane autothermal
reforming were carried out at the University of Salerno, in the framework of the
Italian FISR Project‘‘ Idrogeno puro da gas naturale mediante reforming a con-
versione totale ottenuta integrando reazione chimica e sepatrazione a membrana’’
in collaboration with other universities and Tcnimont KT of Rome. The developed
ATR reactor, up to 5 m3 (stp)/h of hydrogen capacity, has a very fast start-up phase
(lower than 3 min) and stable operation in a wide range of conditions, and is self
sustained due to thermal integration achieved with two heat exchangers for feed
preheating by sensible heat of the reaction products. By this integration, it is
operated without any external heat source, since the liquid water fed to the reactor is
vaporized inside of it [58–60]. The reactor, loaded with structured catalyst in form
of either noble metals- or nickel-based honeycomb monolith or open cells foam
proved how much mass and heat transfer may determine a good performance or
high hydrocarbon conversion [61–63]. Further improvements were obtained by
changing the ﬂow direction through the catalytic bed, evidencing how a radial ﬂow
may assure a more ﬂat temperature proﬁle along the catalytic bed rather than a
traditional axial ﬂow, thus being more proper for the integration with a membrane
[64, 65]. A further ﬂattening of temperature proﬁle was obtained employing high
thermal conductivity (such as SiC) supports. The reactor was also successfully
integrated with a water gas shift stage for preliminary CO abatement in the exhaust
stream. Also in this case using a structured catalyst enables for high CO conversions
with a thermal efﬁciency of about 72% [66]. Moreover, we found that higher CO
conversion is achieved with radial more than axial ﬂow and that in the former case a
centrifugal conﬁguration has to be preferred to centripetal conﬁguration [67].
6.2 Membrane Integration
6.2.1 State of the Art
Few studies are reported in literature dealing with the integration of an autothermal
reforming reactor with a membrane for hydrogen separation, and most of them are
simulation studies.
126
P. Ciambelli et al.
Lattner and Harold [68] carried out a comprehensive modelling study comparing
conventional and membrane reactor fuel processors in terms of efﬁciency (LHV
basis) and reactor volume, considering three process conﬁgurations: (i) ‘conven-
tional’, consisting of a n-tetradecane ATR reactor, followed by a cooled WGS
reactor and a preferential oxidation (PROX) reactor; (ii) ‘palladium membrane
reactor’, consisting of a n-tetradecane ATR reactor integrated with a dense Pd
membrane; (iii) ‘dense oxide membrane reactor’, consisting of a n-tetradecane
ATR reactor integrated with a dense ceramic membrane. In each scheme the ATR
reactor is integrated into an overall process model including fuel cell (50 kW), heat
integration exchangers, and water recycle. It was found that the Pd membrane
reactor has several advantages with respect to the ‘conventional’ conﬁguration such
as: (i) a 20% reduction in the fuel processor volume; (ii) a small improvement in the
overall system efﬁciency (40.7% against 39.7%) due to elimination of the hydrogen
losses in the PROX step; (iii) the use of steam as sweep gas, providing a pre-
humidiﬁed anode feed gas, which can be a requirement in many PEM fuel cell
designs. However, in order to maximize the fuel processor efﬁciency, high tem-
perature (900C) should be employed, resulting in membrane detriment. This issue,
as well as that relevant to the high Pd cost may be overcome by using oxide-based
membranes which showed reasonable performance in terms of productivity.
A following modelling study by Lattner and Harold [69] focused attention on the
comparison between three methanol fuel processor integrated with a PEM fuel cell
(50 kW): (i) steam reformer followed by a PROX reactor; (ii) autothermal reformer
followed by a PROX reactor; (iii) autothermal reformer integrated with a Pd
membrane with countercurrent steam sweep gas. For each conﬁguration the efﬁ-
ciency and the fuel processor volume were evaluated employing the reaction
kinetics of a CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst. Both steam reformer and ATR reactor
followed by PROX stages showed the same efﬁciency (50%, LHV basis), because
the advantage of the ATR system relevant to the absence of external heat sources is
counterbalanced by the higher steam reformer hydrogen concentration in the
reformate. The slightly lower efﬁciency of the ATR membrane reactor is due to the
additional steam generation required for the sweep gas, while the main advantage is
the reduction in fuel processor volume due to the elimination of PROX reactor
(12.7 litres against 21.4 litres of ATR plus PROX). The feasibility of a packed bed
membrane reactor for the ATR of methane was also investigated by Tiemersma
et al. [70], by developing a two-dimensional, pseudo-homogeneous reactor model
to calculate the axial and radial temperature proﬁles and product distribution in the
reactor. Due to the large temperature peak at the reactor entrance, which can be
detrimental for life and stability of Pd membrane, two different operation modes
were investigated to reduce these effects: wall-cooled operation with a high sweep
gas rate, and staged oxygen feed, distributed along the length. In the ﬁrst case
temperature gradients along the membrane can be avoided, however, a decreased
hydrogen removal rate as well as higher CO concentration in the reactor exhaust
were observed. On the other hand the staged oxygen feeding provided for a
reduction in temperature excursions, but a signiﬁcant lower average reactor tem-
perature was observed with a reduction in methane conversion and system
6

127
performance. The major disadvantage of this operation is the more complex reactor
design and the loss in energy efﬁciency between the stages. The authors assessed
the feasibility of the Pd membrane integration in the reactor, but the membrane
must be positioned outside the inlet region with large temperature gradients.
A detailed simulation work dealing with the evaluation of the inﬂuence of
several parameters such as the ﬂowing mode and the rate of sweeping gas, the inlet
rate of CH4, and the inlet ratio CH4 to H2O was carried out by Feng et al. [71].
A Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was considered for the simulation and a H2-membrane
module, consisting of 100 membrane tubes, was applied from 0.2 m away from the
inlet of the reactor in order to avoid too high temperature. The counter-current
ﬂowing mode of sweep gas (steam) was found more suitable with respect to the
co-current, due to a larger average driving force for hydrogen permeation all along
the reactor length, thus resulting in higher molar ﬂow rate of separated H2.
At increasing inlet ﬂow rate of CH4 to the reactor the average temperature of both
reaction and permeate side increases, as well as the molar ﬂow rate of H2 in the
reaction side, the average driving force of H2 permeation and the production rate
of separated H2. However, in these conditions the fraction of hydrogen recovered
(deﬁned as the ratio of separated H2 to the total useful products of CO and H2) and
the CH4 conversion decrease. Thus, an optimal inlet rate of CH4 has to be found in
order to maximize either the production rate of separated H2 per overall CH4 either
the thermodynamic efﬁciency. At decreasing CH4/H2O inlet ratio more steam is
added in the feed, and the H2 molar ﬂow rate in the gas mixture is higher than that
at higher CH4/H2O ratio. However, more inlet steam leads to a lower partial
pressure of H2 in the reaction side, thus lowering the average driving force of
hydrogen permeation. This also corresponds to a decrease in thermodynamic
efﬁciency. Finally, by increasing the rate of sweeping gas, higher production rate
of separated H2, higher fraction of H2 recovered, and higher methane conversion
were obtained. However, these results do not mean that the increase of the rate of
sweeping gas is always necessary, but that for a ﬁxed inlet rate of CH4 there is a
rate of sweeping gas that is just sufﬁcient to separate the produced hydrogen
maximally, while a further increase will result in negligible improvements.
Other reported conﬁgurations of ATR membrane reactors are those involving
both O2 and H2 permeable membranes [72, 73] (the presence of O2 permeable
membrane enables for the injection of oxygen from air at several points over the
length of the reactor in order to reduce temperature hot-spots as also reported
by Tiemersma [70]), or ﬂuidized bed reactors [74–81] or a reactor proposed by
Simakov and Sheintuch [82]. The latter is assumed to be composed of two concentric
cylinders: a ﬁxed bed for steam reforming reaction which contains one or several Pd
membranes, surrounded by an outer tube packed with a catalyst for oxidation
reaction. The main advantage of ﬂuidized bed reactors is the thermal uniformity in
the reaction chamber which is advantageous for maximising membrane utilization
as well as for minimizing thermal stresses in the membranes. The ﬂuidized bed also
provides a greater ﬂexibility to achieve a high membrane surface area per unit
reactor volume compared to packed beds. However, some challenges are
catalyst attrition/erosion, a more complex design/scale-up/construction process.
128
P. Ciambelli et al.
In the example reported by Elnashaie et al. [74–76], Pd-based hydrogen
permselective membrane tubes and dense perovskite oxygen membrane tubes inside
a heptane reformer were considered. The ﬂuidized bed was circulating, thus the
eventually spent catalyst was carried out of the reformer with the exit gas stream,
regenerated along the exit line, separated and recycled. The fast ﬂow of catalyst
makes the effect of carbon deposition on the catalyst activity negligible. In the
example reported by Patil et al. [77] the oxidation section and the reforming/shift
section were separated, with the former containing a O2 permeable membrane and
the latter containing a H2 permeable membrane. In the oxidation section CH4 is
partially oxidized in order to achieve the high temperatures required for O2
permeation through the perovskite membranes and to simultaneously preheat part of
the CH4/steam feed. The preheated feed is mixed with additional CH4 and steam and
fed to the reforming/shift section, where CH4 is completely reformed to CO2 and H2.
The reactor modelling demonstrated that autothermal operation and effective
temperature control in both reactor sections can be achieved along with high CH4
conversion and H2 yields. Moreover, an increase in the superﬁcial gas velocities
leads to an increase in the power output, however at the expense of higher CH4 and
H2 losses in the reactor exhaust.

The main part of the plant is represented by the ATR reactor (36 mm i.d.).
It mostly consists of a lower section where, only during the start-up phase, does
methane react with air at a ﬁxed O2/CH4 ratio, and an upper section where
reforming reactions occur in the presence of the catalyst. Due to the speciﬁc O2/
CH4 ratio in the start-up phase, in the lower section, owing to the exothermicity of
the hydrocarbon oxidation, heat is released and transferred to the reforming section
heating the catalytic bed up to the ATR catalyst threshold temperature. Methane
and air were fed at the bottom of the reactor and premixed in a mixing chamber; a
SiC foam is placed at the exit of the mixing chamber in order to obtain a
well distributed and homogeneous ﬂame. In the start-up phase the ignition of
methane-air mixture is induced by a voltaic arc between two spark plugs placed
on the surface of the SiC foam. The catalyst bed (around 70 cm3) is located
in the reforming section supported by a metallic gauze. Water is fed to the reactor
at the bottom of the metallic gauze. The temperature inside the reactor is moni-
tored by several thermocouples, one of which is located on the SiC foam, while
other thermocouples are placed in the catalytic section to provide the temperature
proﬁle in the reactor’s axial direction. Furthermore, additional thermocouples are
placed to monitor the temperature of preheated water and air, of the exhaust stream
before and after thermal exchange, and of the stream in the premixing chamber.
A differential pressure sensor monitors the pressure drop across the reactor, and the
coke formation. The outside shell of the reactor is thermally insulated to reduce
heat loss. The ATR reactor is integrated with two heat exchangers to preheat
the air and the water fed to the reactor by the exhaust stream. At the reactor outlet a
ﬁxed fraction of exhaust stream is sent to the analysis section through a cold trap to
remove water. Two sets of analyzers monitor simultaneously gaseous component
concentrations on both permeate and retentate side. In particular, CH4, CO and
CO2 concentrations were monitored with an on line NDIR analyzer, for the
analysis of O2 a continuous paramagnetic analyzer was employed, H2 was
analysed with a thermo conductivity analyzer.
The tests were carried out with a cylindrical membrane made up of Al2O3
(Inocermic GmbH), the length of the membrane module was around 10 cm
(Fig. 6.2).
The module was activated with the following thermal pre-treatment:
1. Ramp temperature 1C/min to 105C;
2. Isotherm at 105C for 1 h;

3. Ramp temperature 1C/min to 140C;
4. Isotherm at 140C for 1 h;
5. Ramp temperature 1C/min to operating temperature.
This procedure was carried out by ﬂowing an inert gas on both tube and shell
sides of the membrane.
In order to realize the integration of the structured ATR reactor with the
membrane high attention must be paid to the choice of the catalyst structure. For
this reason a foam structured support was chosen in order to enable the gas ﬂowing
through the catalyst to the membrane surface, due to its porous network
(Fig. 6.3a). Furthermore, the catalyst was annular shaped to realize the proper
insertion of the membrane (Fig. 6.3b).
The choice of the catalyst structure was optimized. Indeed, our previous activity
was relevant to the optimization of the temperature proﬁle along the catalytic bed,
in order to ensure the lowest strain for the operation of the membrane [64, 65].
We found that a high thermal conductivity material, such as silicon carbide, along
with a radial ﬂow geometry may lead to a more isothermal proﬁle along the
catalytic bed.
In this more innovative assembly, ﬁve elements of catalyzed foams were col-
lected as reported in Fig. 6.4.
An alumina adhesive layer is placed on both ends of catalytic bed, in order to
provide a radial ﬂow for gases coming from the mixing chamber and the mem-
brane tube is inserted inside the catalytic bed. Furthermore, in order to allow
simultaneously the sweep gas inlet and the permeate outlet, a stainless steel
component (Fig. 6.5) is inserted at the top of the reactor.
It contains two internal tubes; the sweep gas enters in one of them, ﬂows
through a coaxial tube located inside the membrane and allows the transport of the
permeate gas through the second internal tube.
Since the membrane and the catalytic bed located around the membrane are
inserted upside down into the reactor body (Fig. 6.6) it was necessary to use an
Fig. 6.3 SEM image of foam porous network (a) and catalyst shape for the insertion of the
membrane (b)

adhesive for bonding the ceramic membrane and catalyst to the reactor stainless
steel and avoiding any ﬂow of the retentate gas in the permeate side.
Two thermocouples were inserted in the reactor to monitor the temperature at
the inlet (T2) and outlet (T1) side of the catalytic bed, with the T1 very close to the
membrane surface (Fig. 6.7).
Furthermore, due to the absence of external heat sources, a metallic-shielded
heating tape controlled by a PID temperature controller was wrapped all around
the external surface of the reactor body, in order to carry out the thermal pre-
treatment of the membrane.
6.3 Membrane Reactor Performance
The performance of the membrane reactor was evaluated in the following oper-
ating conditions:
1. molar feed ratio O2/CH4 = 0.56;
2. molar feed ratio H2O/CH4 = 1.5;
3. absolute pressure ranging between 1 and 5 atm;
4. gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) = 12,000 h-1
where GHSV was deﬁned as the ratio between the total gaseous ﬂow rate (STP)
fed to the reactor and the volume of the whole catalytic bed. In these operating
conditions, derived from a previous optimization [64, 65], the maximum tem-
perature reached along the catalytic bed was about 505C, a suitable value for
avoiding any damage to the membrane.
The reactor start-up followed the step of membrane thermal pre-treatment
(Fig. 6.8): the electrical heating tapes were turned off and the reactor was fed with
a mixture of methane, air and nitrogen in order to heat the combustion zone and
the catalyst up to the operating conditions in two different steps. In the ﬁrst step
methane combustion occurred homogeneously on the silicon carbide foam,

thermocouples inside the

133
and heat transfer caused the increase in the temperature of the system catalyst-
membrane, heated under nitrogen ﬂow. When the temperature of the membrane
reached around 400C, the nitrogen ﬂow was stopped, water was added to the
reaction mixture and the operating conditions were moved to the desired ones. As
a consequence, the temperature of the SiC foam suddenly decreased and a slight
increase in the temperature of the catalyst-membrane occurred, without rising
above 500C.
The results of catalytic activity tests carried out with the INOCERMIC mem-
brane at 1 atm are reported in Fig. 6.9 in terms of CH4, CO, CO2, H2 concentration
(vol%, dry basis) at both retentate and permeate sides as function of time. During
the start-up phase only CO2 was detected at the reactor outlet at the retentate side,
due to the methane total combustion, while at the permeate side any gaseous
component was detected. After the reactor start-up the more reducing conditions
allowed to obtain a mixture of CH4, CO, CO2 and H2 at both retentate and
permeate sides, with a remarkable amount of H2 with respect to the other com-
ponents. The H2 concentration at the permeate side was about 2 vol%, while the
temperature close to the membrane surface was about 490C.
The progressive increase of the absolute pressure led to a progressive decrease
in the H2 concentration and CH4 conversion on the retentate side (Fig. 6.10), due
to the harmful effect of pressure on the reforming reactions. In spite of this, on the
permeate side, an increase of the permeated hydrogen as well as the other species
concentration occurred, with the product distribution remaining almost the same.
The obtained data were elaborated with the Knudsen (or free-molecule) diffu-
sion model, according to which the ﬂux of a gaseous species through a membrane
is directly proportional to its partial pressure at retentate side and has an inverse
dependence on the square root of its molecular weight [83]. Thus, in order to
validate the model of Knudsen diffusion through the membrane, the ratios H2/CH4,
H2/CO and H2/CO2 were evaluated on the permeate side and compared with the
expected ones (Fig. 6.11).
It can be observed that for CH4 the experimental values are close to the
expected ones for Knudsen diffusion at each operating pressure. This should be
ascribed to a Knudsen diffusion. However, besides Knudsen diffusion another

mechanism due to the molecular size must be taken into account. Indeed the
enhanced transport of CO and CO2 through the alumina-based membrane can be
explained with their lower molecular size with respect to that of the CH4 molecule
(CO2 = 0.33 nm, CO = 0.376 nm, CH4 = 0.38 nm) [84, 85]. Moreover, an
increase of pressure leads to a decrease of all separation factors, indeed at high
pressures the contribution of transport through membrane cracks could be
enhanced [86].
For a better understanding of the effect of the integration with the ATR reactor,
the comparison between CH4 conversion and CO, CO2 and H2 concentration at the
reactor outlet in the presence and absence of the membrane is reported in
Fig. 6.12. For CH4 conversion, thermodynamic calculations carried out at the
temperature inside the catalytic bed are also reported.
It can be observed that at each operating pressure investigated the presence of
the membrane allows to reach a higher CH4 conversion, closer to the predicted
thermodynamic one. Moreover, in the presence of membrane, on the retentate side
lower H2 and CO2 concentrations and higher CO concentration were observed.
6.4 Future Perspectives
The experimental feasibility of the integration of a membrane inside an ATR ﬁxed
bed reactor has been demonstrated. High attention must be paid to both catalyst
formulation and arrangement/integration with membrane in order to guarantee its
performance and stability. Clearly, even if the presence of the membrane could
favour the achievement of higher CH4 conversion at lower temperature, the
peculiar temperature proﬁle established along the catalytic bed in an ATR reactor
is not very suitable for the integration of the membrane. Accordingly, the reactor
architecture is more complex if compared with that in the absence of the mem-
brane, but the advantage observed in terms of fuel processor volume reduction, due
to water gas shift and preferential oxidation stages elimination, may drive towards
an optimization and diffusion of this innovative solution.
The membrane reactor technology is not yet well established and some deﬁ-
ciencies have to be overcome before its implementation at larger scale. In par-
ticular, future research should be devoted to the preparation of membranes able to
work for a long period of time at high temperature and pressures and even more
resistant in aggressive environments. Furthermore, the sealing of membranes into
modules is also another point to be improved in order to avoid problems of streams
mixing or bypassing during the reaction tests. Finally, the optimization of engi-
neering in module preparation will be a crucial step for increasing the membrane
reactor efﬁciency. All these optimizations, when carried out, will provide for a
technology standardization that will enable for its diffusion. By this way, even if at
the moment the costs linked to this solution are quite high (in particular, those
relevant to membrane fabrication), it should be possible that the establishment of
6

an economy of scale will enable for a costs depreciation, making this solution
more competitive with those currently proposed (refer to Chap. 3).

7.1 Process Description
The water–gas shift reaction (WGSR) (7.1) was discovered more than two
centuries ago by Italian physicist Felice Fontana in 1780 [1].
CO þ H2O $ CO2 þ H2
ð7:1Þ
Although the ﬁrst report was published in 1888 by Mond and Longer [2], the
technical importance of the WGSR was not recognized until the development of
the Haber process. Currently, the WGSR is used in various chemical processes,
such as hydrogen and ammonia production, Fisher–Tropsch and methanol syn-
thesis. Also, it is considered to be an important process for the removal of CO in
small-scale future power generation, based on fuel cells for both mobile and
stationary applications.
The WGSR is not affected by pressure and is moderately exothermic
(DH298 K
0
= -41.1 kJ mol-1); therefore, its equilibrium constant decreases with
temperature, favoring higher CO conversions at lower temperatures. Addition of

greater than stoichiometric quantities of steam improves the conversion. Since
under adiabatic conditions, the heat of reaction increases process temperature,
conversion in a single catalyst bed is thermodynamically limited. A signiﬁcant
improvement is obtained with a double catalyst bed operation, with the second bed
operating at the lowest possible inlet temperature. Usually, the high temperature
shift (HTS) reactor operates in the range of 350–420C with an iron-chromium
oxide-based catalyst, and the low-temperature shift (LTS) reactor operates in the
range of 180–340C with a Cu–ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst [3]. With this reactor archi-
tecture, the exit concentration of CO could be as low as 0.1–0.3%. However, some
serious disadvantages could also be identiﬁed. The HTS catalyst has low activity at
lower temperatures, and the process is thermodynamically limited at high tem-
peratures. The low temperature Cu–ZnO catalyst is sensitive to air exposure, pro-
motes temperature excursions and requires lengthy preconditioning for intermittent
operation. Thus, a signiﬁcant effort to improve the performance of iron [4–10] and
Cu–ZnO [11–13]-based catalysts by optimizing the catalyst preparation and for-
mulation is evident in the literature. Because of its unique redox properties, ceria
was tested as CuO-based catalyst support [14–18]. Also, research attention has been
recently focused on the use of noble metals such as Pt [19–27] and Au [28–34].
One of the potential applications of the WGSR is the integrated gasiﬁcation
combined (IGCC) process, in which the gasiﬁcation of coal produces synthesis gas
and the WGSR converts the CO to produce additional H2. Despite coal being an
available raw material with relatively stable cost for H2 production as an alter-
native to gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons, the IGCC process presents additional
challenges because of the lower pressure and lower H2 content of the clean gas.
In the nineties, the ﬁrst generation of IGCC plants appeared, and although they
are reliable and have shown environmental beneﬁts, further improvements to
simplify the process, increase efﬁciency and lower costs are needed to advance the
commercial outlook of the IGCC scheme. Despite the existence of several com-
mercial, entrained ﬂow gasiﬁcation systems for the production of fuel gas or
syngas, the process has yet to be demonstrated on the commercial scale as part
of an integrated plant for the production of H2 with the collection and storage of
species of environmental concern such as CO2. These systems, including Shell,
Texaco, Destec and Prenﬂo gasiﬁers, are similar in that they utilize pulverized coal
and operate at pressures in the range of 20–70 bar and temperatures around
1,500C with very high fuel heating rates. Differences in these systems include the
way in which the fuel is introduced, the concentration of steam and methods
employed for heat recovery.
A block ﬂow diagram for a conventional IGCC plant is shown in Fig. 7.1. The
hot syngas from the gasiﬁer is passed through a Heat Recovery Steam Generation
Unit, where it is cooled to below 300C. Next, the syngas is passed to the Filtration
Unit, where ﬁne particulates are removed. Further clean-up is carried out in the
Water Wash Unit, followed by sulphur removal and recovery. The process of
separating sulphur compounds consists of a catalytic hydrolysis reactor in which
COS is transformed into H2S and HCN in NH3. The H2S is recovered by MDEA in
an absorption column. The MDEA is regenerated in a second column where H2S is

separated and sent to the Claus recovery unit, where it is converted to sulphur
and water. For the Puertollano IGCC plant, the typical composition of the clean
gas is within the following range [35]: H2 19.3–24.87%, Ar 0.76–1.33%,
CO 57.67–63.37%, CO2 1.51–3.72%, COS 0.14–20 ppmv, H2S 0–10 ppmv, CH4
35–120 ppmv, CNH 1–3 ppmv, NH3 3 ppmv, SO2 0–9 ppmv and CS2 0–5 ppmv.
This stream is collected at a temperature of 126.4–144.6C and a pressure of
18.8–21.2 barg. The clean gas is then sent to a gas turbine where a combined cycle
is applied for electricity generation.
A schematic of the conventional WGSR is shown in Fig. 7.2. For the con-
ventional coal-to-hydrogen process, the WGSR takes place after the ﬁltration unit
and before the acid gas removal unit. For this reason, a sulphur tolerant catalyst
must be used for the WGSR.
Steam is added to the syngas before entering the WGSR reactor. The WGSR is
assumed to reach equilibrium by the exit of each reactor, which is estimated to give a
CO conversion of at least 80%, depending on the adiabatic temperature of the
reactor. All of the H2S and most of the CO2 are removed in the acid gas removal unit.
Available acid gas removal technologies include low temperature absorption by
amines, glycol and chilled methanol; hot potassium carbonate process; and sepa-
ration by low temperature polymeric membranes. All the low temperature processes
require gas cooling and heat recovery leading to energy losses. Also, signiﬁcant
energy is required for regeneration in solvent- and reagent-based systems. Finally,
hydrogen is puriﬁed by PSA and used for power generation. The PSA tail gas, which
still contains CH4, H2 and CO, is sent to a boiler for steam generation.

From what is described, it is quite clear that a WGSR is required in the process
scheme only when CO2 removal or further production of H2 is necessary.
The existing technologies using absorption with physical solvents, namely Rectisol
and Selexol, or chemicals such as m-DEA, can be readily applied to capture CO2
from the coal gas at IGCC plants. However, such applications have signiﬁcant
energy and equipment requirements for solvent circulation and heat exchange,
which results in a reduction in efﬁciency by ca. 6% (i.e. from ca. 42 to 36%).
Consequently, new systems need to be developed, such as advanced membranes or
adsorbents that offer signiﬁcant potential for efﬁciency improvements and cost
reduction for CO2 capture in gasiﬁcation. Cheaper, more efﬁcient H2 separation
membranes as passive separators are promising alternatives to conventional
scrubbers. Further, the integration of membranes with WGS reactors is promising
since, in addition to H2 separation and CO2 recovery, selective removal of H2 from
the reactor allows for further conversion of CO beyond that possible through con-
ventional WGSRs. Several studies available in the open literature report the feasi-
bility of the use of WGSR membrane reactors in IGCC systems [36–42].
As a reference case, the simulation of a conventional WGSR unit was carried
out. A good prediction of WGSR efﬂuent stream was obtained using a temperature
approach based on the ShiftMax 120 catalyst produced by Sud-Chemie [43]
assuming WGSR feed gas compositions that are typically produced by the

Puertolano gasiﬁcation plant. For the high CO concentrations in the syngas,
it is necessary to use two HTS reactor stages, each of which operate with an inlet
temperature of 350C.
The steam fed to the ﬁrst HTS reactor from the gasiﬁer has a steam to CO ratio of
about 2. Extra steam from ‘battery limits’ is required to bring the steam-to-CO ratio
to 3.3 to meet the requirements of the catalyst. In Table 7.1 the material balance for
the two HTS reactors is shown, based on hydrogen production of 25,000 Nm3/h.
The CO conversion in the ﬁrst HTS reactor is 81.4%. Since the WGSR is
exothermic, heat is removed after the ﬁrst HTS reactor to render the thermody-
namics favourable for further conversion of CO. Of the CO remaining from the
ﬁrst HTS reactor, 51.7% is converted in the second HTS reactor to give an overall
plant CO conversion of 91%. The hydrogen from the WGSR is recovered by PSA.
The PSA off-gas contains small amounts of H2 and CO that can be burned in a
combustor. In order to increase CO conversion, a recycle of this gas may also be
considered. Because of the high percentage of N2 and CO2 in the off-gas, this
option does not result in signiﬁcant improvements in plant efﬁciency because of
the increased plant size requirements. Therefore, this off-gas is considered useful
for heat recovery only by its LHV (1,141 kcal/kg) and ﬂow rate. A H2 recovery of
85% has been assumed for the PSA unit.
7.2 Membrane-Assisted IGCC
It is considered that combining the IGCC and hydrogen membrane reactor
technologies could radically improve a commercial outlook for the IGCC scheme
application to power production with zero CO2 emissions, leading to elimination
of coal-ﬁred power plants [36, 44, 45]. The expected signiﬁcant process simpli-
ﬁcation and intensiﬁcation capitalizes on a paradigm offered by membrane reac-
tors, which allows for the reaction and separation to be combined in one step. An
example of the expected gain in CO conversion by hydrogen removal during the
WGSR is shown in Fig. 7.3.
Membrane integration with the IGCC could practically be realized in two
possible reactor architectures determined by a relative placement of the
membranes and catalysts. In the simplest arrangement, two membrane passive
separators could be located in front of each of the conventional HTS and LTS

reactors, forming the so-called open architecture (OA). In this conﬁguration,
carbon capture would consist of a CO2 removal unit and ﬁnal puriﬁcation with
PSA. The more complex but less process-intensive closed architecture (CA) would
eliminate the conventional HTS and LTS reactors entirely, replacing them by a
single membrane reactor containing suitable WGS catalyst and thus fully capi-
talizing on the principle of reaction and separation in one step. Hydrogen would be
removed through the membrane as it is produced, circumventing the thermody-
namic limitation and producing a clean, sequestration-ready CO2 stream. This
arrangement may currently be considered technically too complex from an engi-
neering or maintenance point of view, but it seems to be the most studied case on
the laboratory scale. Nevertheless, the OA should not be considered an alternative
to CA, but rather the ﬁrst simpler step towards commercial realization of hydrogen
selective membrane technology integration with the WGSR process. Both these
reactor architectures are reviewed in this chapter.
7.3 Closed Architecture
A growing interest in the membrane-assisted WGSR is manifested by a substantial
volume of the published pertinent literature that could be grouped around the
two most popular hydrogen permselective membranes, based either on palladium
[46–55] or silica [56–59]. The cited references cover only the most recent and
most representative examples.
Basile et al. [46] studied the WGSR in a palladium membrane reactor and
showed the importance of the membrane preparation method in obtaining high-
quality membrane materials. Magnetron sputtering, physical vapour deposition
and co-condensation techniques were applied to realize submicron palladium

membranes. The best membrane increased CO conversion up to 99.89% at about
330C and stable performance was reported for more than 2 months [47].
Iyoha et al. [50] assessed the performance of a Pd and Pd80 wt%Cu membrane
reactor at 900C with a 241 kPa trans-membrane pressure differential intended to
be positioned downstream of a coal gasiﬁer. No catalyst was used as it was
expected that the membrane tubes would sufﬁciently catalyse and further enhance
the fast rate of the WGSR at this temperature. There was a signiﬁcant increase in
CO conversion from the equilibrium value of 54–93% with the Pd membrane,
while conversion of 66% was attained with the Pd80 wt%Cu membrane. The
markedly lower conversion with the Pd80 wt%Cu membrane was attributed to its
lower H2 permeance. However, after about 8 days on stream, pinhole formation
was conﬁrmed by SEM-EDS for both membranes. In follow-up WGSR studies
[51], these membranes were applied to the simulated coal gasiﬁcation syngas
feeds. CO conversion of 99.7% was achieved at 900C in a counter-current, Pd
multi-tube membrane reactor operated at a 2-s residence time. The conversion of
CO was considerably higher than the approximately 32% equilibrium conversion
allowed in a conventional reactor. As found previously, the Pd80 wt%Cu membrane
tubes gave a signiﬁcantly lower CO conversion of only 68%. Exposure of both
membranes to syngas mixtures containing H2S at levels below the thresh-

(H2S/H2 \ *0.0011) did not affect the mechanical strength of the membranes, but
caused a steep drop in CO conversion because of deactivation of the catalyst
surface. Any further increase in H2S concentration destroyed the membranes
within minutes.
Recently, Barbieri et al. [52] proposed an innovative conﬁguration of a mem-
brane reactor consisting of a conventional ﬁxed bed reactor followed by a mem-
brane reactor loaded with the same catalyst. This conﬁguration was viewed as
particularly suitable for reactions characterized by slow kinetics, such as
the WGSR, as it stimulates more effective membrane utilization by optimizing the
driving force and minimizing the H2 back permeation to the reaction side. The
WGSR was tested between 280 and 320C using a commercial CuO/CeO2-based
catalyst and Pd–Ag membrane without sweeping for an equimolecular H2O/CO
stream at pressures between 2 and 6 atm and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV)
between 2,000 and 10,000 h-1. A signiﬁcant reduction in the required reaction
volume to reach CO conversion similar to that of the conventional reactor was
achieved, which should result in a decreased cost of operation.
Bi et al. [53] employed a noble metal base catalyst Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 and Pd
membrane reactor to study the WGSR using feeds obtained by autothermal
reforming of natural gas. CO conversion remained above thermodynamic equi-
librium up to feed space velocities of 9,100 l kg-1 h-1 at 350C, Ptotal = 1.2 MPa
and S/C = 3, but H2 recovery decreased from 84.8% at space velocity of
4,050 l kg-1 h-1 to 48.7% at the highest space velocity. This rapid decline of
separation performance was attributed to slow H2 diffusion through the catalyst
bed, suggesting that external mass ﬂow resistance has a signiﬁcant impact on the
H2 permeation rate in such membrane reactors.

Technical and Economical Evaluation of WGSR

Near-complete conversion of CO was obtained by Kikuchi et al. [60] and by
Uemiya et al. [61] in the WGSR carried out at 400C in a double tubular Pd
membrane reactor with a commercial iron-chromium oxide as catalyst.
Despite all these studies, a recent economic feasibility study of the membrane-
assisted WGSR conducted to quantify the advantage over conventional technology
disproved the concept for Pd membrane reactors [62] and supported the use of
ceramic membranes [36].
Microporous silica hydrogen permselective membranes have been extensively
studied as a potentially more practical alternative to Pd membranes. Very recently,
a comprehensive review was published, tackling various aspects of silica mem-
brane synthesis, application and economics [63]. It was made evident that state-
of-the-art silica membranes have good hydrogen ﬂux and separation, as well as
respectable thermal stability. However, the hydrothermal stability of a silica
hydrogen permselective membrane is a key factor in determining its suitability for
a commercial application of membrane-assisted processes.
A silica membrane prepared by the soaking–rolling procedure on a porous
stainless steel disc [64] was employed by Brunetti et al. [56] for the WGSR from
220 to 290C and up to 600 kPa using a commercial CuO/CeO2-based catalyst.
The CO conversion always exceeded conversions attainable in a conventional
reactor at temperatures higher than 250C. The CO conversion difference between
the conventional and the membrane reactor increased with temperature and was
more pronounced at lower reaction pressures. It was determined that the best
operating conditions for the membrane reactor were 280C and 400 kPa.
Application of a silica membrane supported on molecular sieve to the low-
temperature WGSR at 280C was reported by Giessler et al. [57]. Although almost
complete conversion of CO was claimed, the low H2/N2 separation of the mem-
brane opened up a possibility for CO to cross the membrane to the sweep stream
and for the sweep gas to enter the product stream, artiﬁcially boosting the
conversion.
Battersby et al. [58] investigated the WGSR in silica membrane between 150
and 250C. The H2/CO separation increased from 5 to 15 with temperature, but at
conversions below 40%, the H2 driving force for permeation was lower than that
for CO, dictating the minimum conversion for which the membrane reactor could
be effective. In a follow-up study [59], a cobalt-silica membrane was used to test
the WGSR up to 300C. The initial H2/CO separation increased with temperature,
resulting in up to 95% purity of the permeated H2. A 7% increase in conversion
above that obtained in a conventional reactor was achieved at 300C and the
membrane showed a reasonable on-stream stability for about 200 h. However, the
membrane had no effect on conversion below 200C, indicating that application
of a membrane reactor in a kinetically controlled range of the WGSR is perhaps
not the best choice of conditions to demonstrate a paradigm offered by membrane
reactors, as the equilibrium conversion is already high but the reaction rate is
low. The hydrothermal stability of the membrane was most likely an issue at
higher temperatures and dictated the choice of these less representative
conditions.
150
P. Ciambelli et al.
The membrane-assisted WGSR was studied by Galuszka et al. [65] using a
commercial iron-chromia-based catalyst at 450C in conventional and silica
membrane ﬁxed-bed reactors. The H2O/CO ratio was kept at 1.75. The catalyst
gave a steady performance and up to 80% of the H2 produced during the WGSR in
the membrane reactor was removed through the membrane that had the initial
H2/N2 separation of * 150 and H2 permeance of *2.5 (NTP) cm3 cm-2
min-1 atm-1 (0.19 9 10-6 mol m-2 s-1 Pa-1). A 6–10% increase in CO con-
version was achieved in a membrane reactor as compared to a conventional reactor
for a simulated feed stream from a gasiﬁer. After about 10 days on-stream, the
H2/N2 separation of the membrane usually decreased to about 50% of the initial
value. After that, further decrease in membrane performance was barely notice-
able. The overall excellent performance of the CanmetENERGY membrane
evoked great conﬁdence in the demonstrated feasibility of a novel WGS reactor
concept and provided a good base for a modelling study.
The kinetics of the WGSR was studied extensively and a great variety of
alternative models and different mechanisms were proposed as outlined in [65].

imposing a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism [48] to evaluate the reaction rate
‘r’ of CO consumption, seems to be a popular choice and the modelling of con-
ventional and membrane reactors described by Galuszka et al. [65] was based on
this mechanism. The kinetic parameters were ﬁrst evaluated for the set of
experimental data derived from the conventional reactor studies where the three
different feeds were used with the same amount of catalyst and variable contact
time. Excel Solver program was applied to minimize the sum of squared residuals
of the calculated and experimental CO ﬂows.
Then, the evaluated kinetic constants were used to model the membrane reactor
data. An example of the results taken from [65] is shown in Fig. 7.4.
The experimental point in Fig. 7.4 was an average integral conversion during a
steady-state operation for 30 h on stream run. It was observed [65] that in addition
to the experimentally determined H2 permeance, the water permeance of silica
membrane, equal to about 30% of its H2 permeance, had to be assumed to obtain an
adequate ﬁt. Curve A in Fig. 7.4 denoted simply CO conversion based on the
amount of hydrogen removed, without considering the kinetics as shown in Fig. 7.3.
The calculated conversion of CO along the length of the membrane indicated that
only about 12% of the catalyst was needed to bring the system to thermodynamic
equilibrium. The rest of the catalyst assisted by membrane provided the additional
6% conversion above the equilibrium level as observed experimentally.

Technical and Economical Evaluation of WGSR

These modelling data provided, for the very ﬁrst time, a solid base enabling a
realistic extrapolation of the inﬂuence of membrane performance on the extent of
the WGSR, including its kinetics. The most interesting conclusion of that study
was the estimated real membrane performance that was needed to engage the full
length of the catalyst bed and to obtain almost complete conversion of CO. It was
calculated that increasing the membrane H2 permeance by a factor of only two and
operating with a H2O/CO ratio of approximately 3.8 would fully engage the cat-
alyst and increase the CO conversion to about 98% at 450C. However, hydrogen
removal would need to be ﬁve times more efﬁcient, as measured by the sweep rate,
to keep an adequate driving force for the membrane. Since water permeated
through the silica membrane, the increased amount of water was needed to help
improve the kinetics of the WGSR and to avoid downstream water depletion in the
membrane reactor.
The WGSR in a mixed protonic–electronic conducting SrCe0.9Eu0.1O3-d
membrane coated on a Ni-SrCeO3-d support was studied by Li et al. [66]. At 900C
a 46% increase in CO conversion was achieved, with the feed stream having a
H2O/CO ratio of 2.
Another concept of circumventing the thermodynamic limitation of the WGSR
considered in the literature was the application of CO2 permselective membranes.
It was claimed that the use of CO2-selective membranes may present some
advantage compared to H2-selective membranes because (i) a H2-rich product is
recovered at high pressure (feed gas pressure) and (ii) air can be used to sweep
CO2-rich permeate on the low pressure side of the membrane [67]. A one-
dimensional non-isothermal model to simulate the counter-current hollow-ﬁber
membrane reactor was developed by Huang et al. [67]. Based on the modelling
study, a CO concentration of less than 10 ppm, a H2 recovery of greater than 97%
and a H2 concentration of greater than 54% (on the dry basis) are achievable from
autothermal reforming syngas. Moreover, if steam reforming syngas is fed into the
membrane reactor, then a H2 concentration greater than 99.6% can be obtained
along with a reduced membrane area requirement. The modelling study showed

that both the WGSR rate and CO2 permeation played an important role on overall
reactor performance. The model was later veriﬁed experimentally by the same
authors using a rectangular ﬂat-sheet WGS membrane reactor with an autothermal
reforming syngas at 150C [68]. Further investigations by Huang and Ho [69]
considered several parameters such as inlet feed temperature, inlet sweep tem-
perature, feed-side pressure, WGSR catalyst activity and CO inlet feed concen-
tration. An increase in the inlet feed temperature and the inlet sweep temperature
(up to about 160C) resulted in a reduction of the required membrane area. The
same result was obtained with an increase in the feed-side pressure.
It needs to noted, however, that the CO2 permselective membrane, which is in
its developmental infancy, is conceptually more difﬁcult than the much more
versatile and close to commercialization H2-selective membrane. The principle of
molecular size discrimination, which forms the basis of the hydrogen permselec-
tive membrane cannot be applied to CO2 separation since CO2 is larger than or of
similar molecular size as the species that it must be separated from. The idea of
membrane chemical ‘functionalization’, which is necessary to achieve selective
separation of CO2, is difﬁcult to implement and will most likely result in a sig-
niﬁcant limitation to the CO2 membrane range of applications.
7.4 Open Reactor Architecture
The proposed membrane integration with the IGCC in the simplest arrangement of
the OA, having membrane passive separators located in front of each conventional
WGSR reactor, could be the ﬁrst step in a practical realization of the membrane-
assisted WGSR. A schematic of the OA WGSR reactor is shown in Fig. 7.5. In this
scheme the shell and tube membrane separator modules are constructed from silica
hydrogen permselective tubular membranes. The performance of a silica mem-
brane used in [65] is shown in Table 7.2.
The membrane separator selectively removes H2 from the syngas feed so that
the conversion of CO in the following WGSR conventional reactor can be more
thermodynamically favourable. A hydrogen-rich permeate stream and a medium
pressure CO2-rich stream are obtained as an end product. Because the hydrogen is
removed before the WGSR, the volume of the syngas stream is reduced, resulting
in a lower steam requirement to maintain appropriate steam concentration to avoid
sintering of the catalyst. Owing to the improved thermodynamics resulting from
H2 removal by the membrane, the WGSR may be operated at a higher inlet
temperature (515C) where kinetics is more favourable.
The addition of steam before the second reactor brings the S/C ratio to 2.2 and
simultaneously lowers the ﬁrst WGSR reactor outlet stream temperature from 540
to 515C and prevents catalyst sintering in the second WGSR reactor. The per-
formance of this innovative conﬁguration is reported in Table 7.3.

increased conversions in both the ﬁrst and second reactors. It is expected that the
heat required for CO2 sequestration between these two processes would be similar.
The coupling of membrane separation modules and the conventional WGSR
reactors through this novel architecture results in higher CO conversions and better
overall efﬁciencies. For the same hydrogen product ﬂow of 25,000 Nm3/h, only

about 90% of feed is used compared with the conventional process scheme,
resulting in a signiﬁcant reduction of the variable operating cost.
With the conventional technology, decarbonized fuel is puriﬁed by removing
the CO2 from the shifted syngas by low temperature membranes. However, with
the OA WGSR membrane reactor, the fuel stream is enriched in H2 by the
membrane reactor and requires only polishing by PSA.
Using the membrane performance listed in Table 7.2, the required membrane
surface areas for the two modules have been calculated for the OA scheme,
adopting a Hydrogen Recovery Factor (HRF) of 70%. The effect of inlet pressure
and H2 permeance on the membrane surface area is reported in Fig. 7.6 for the ﬁrst
and second modules. The membrane surface area required to achieve the ﬁxed HRF
under the conditions dictated by the heat and material balance was calculated using
a one-dimensional, steady-state model assuming a steam sweeping ratio of 50%.
7.5 Preliminary Economic Considerations
In order to evaluate the proposed scheme, two options are compared:
1. Conventional ‘Pre-combustion decarbonation’, where synthesis gas is water–
gas shifted to mostly H2 and CO2 and then split into two separate streams: one
that is CO2-rich, to be compressed and stored, and one that is pure H2, to be
used as decarbonized fuel. This will be referred to as Scheme A.
2. Membrane-based ‘Pre-combustion decarbonation’ using the OA scheme as
described in Sect. 7.4. This will be referred to as Scheme B.
A detailed comparison of the above two schemes is quite a complex exercise
and goes beyond the scope of this study. The purpose of this paragraph is to
provide a preliminary economic assessment of the use of membrane reactors to
improve the IGCC process in terms of production of a fuel for electric generation
and the capture of carbon dioxide.

Technical and Economical Evaluation of WGSR
155
Both schemes share similar concepts; however, the presence of the membrane
separator in Scheme B results in a feed requirement reduction of approximately
10%. The membrane-based Scheme B is estimated to have a higher power
consumption and higher capital cost for the WGSR than the conventional case but
is estimated to have a lower capital cost in the area of CO2 removal and PSA
puriﬁcation. Owing to the difﬁculty in the evaluation of the impact of the 10%
reduction in feed requirement for a coal unit on the variable costs, our analysis was
limited to capital investment. The conventional scheme is considered the base case
using heat and material balances developed in the previous section. Table 7.4
compares the capital investment between the conventional case (Scheme A) and
the Membrane-based case (Scheme B) for a unit producing 25000 Nm3/h of pure
hydrogen. Since the current study is based mostly on small-scale experiments with
membrane reactors and separators, the model presented here is a study in progress.
The real system would be very large, within the range of 1500–4000 m2, as
dictated by the combination of membrane permeance and operating pressure of the
gasiﬁcation process. It would also be expensive and probably relatively delicate.
It is assumed that such a system can be built and maintained for a membrane cost
on the order of 1,000 €/m2.
As a rough approximation of the investment cost for the membrane-based
‘Pre-combustion decarbonation’ seems to be aligned with conventional technology
if the costs of the membrane and the required membrane surface area remain as
predicted. There is a reduction in variable costs associated with the lower feed
requirement for the membrane reactor case (Scheme B). This decrease in the cost
upstream to the WGSR is estimated to be in the range of 2–3%.
The presently accepted CO2 penalization foreseen in Europe until 2016 is 26 €/
ton of CO2 captured and removed by a conventional technology. The 10% feed
reduction achieved in the OA membrane-based scheme translates into a 28,000-
ton-a-year decrease in CO2 emissions for the plant size under consideration
(0.14 kg of CO2 for each Nm3 of H2 produced). It was estimated that the overall

average cost of producing hydrogen by WGSR could be reduced by about 4% by
applying the OA membrane technology.
For the Post-combustion decarbonation process, CO2 is removed after com-
bustion at ambient pressure and in a diluted ﬂue gas stream. The amine scrubbing
technology in an oxygen environment is still not under control and a compressor is
required to increase the ﬂue gas pressure to have a minimum pressure drop on the
absorbing system. Since the CO2 removal section is the most costly in terms of
capital investment as shown in Table 7.4, it is reasonable to assume that with an
increase of more than 25% in capital investment, the post-combustion decarbon-
ation is going to cost more than the other two processes, without considering the
energy penalty associated with compression and solvent regeneration in the O2
environment. It is, however, obvious that such a comparison is quite rough on a
subject which is extremely complex.
The proposed scheme of ‘Pre-combustion decarbonation’ based on the use of
membranes for hydrogen separation is expected to have some advantages over the
conventional and commercially ready technology, such as superior efﬁciency and
reduction in overall plant capital cost. Membrane-based systems may represent a
real advancement in state-of-the-art H2 and CO2 capture in such power plants;
however, their real application is closely linked to the realization of a membrane
module that is economically built and maintained, as well as to the improvement
of membrane permeance and selectivity.
7.6 Conclusion
The OA WGSR membrane reactor scheme examined here is a ﬁrst step in the
evaluation of membrane reactor technology as applied to the IGCC process. The
greatest gains, however, are expected with the implementation of the CA conﬁg-
uration where the WGSR and membrane are integrated in a membrane reactor.
A substantial plant size reduction could be expected and further process intensiﬁ-
cation could be achieved by considering other factors such as placement of the
catalyst bed within the membrane module, and catalyst structure and functionality.
For instance, a foam structured catalyst could enable different ﬂow geometry
(radial) along the catalytic bed compared to the conventional one (axial) [70], thus
optimizing catalyst effectiveness. Also, the improvement in catalyst functionality
may enable operation at lower temperatures without substantially affecting reaction
kinetics.

of Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S)

8.1 Introduction
Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) occurs naturally in many gas wells; its concentration in
natural gas varies from traces to 90% by volume. E.g. Canada’s Caroline and
Bearberry gas ﬁelds in West-Central Alberta contain between 70 and 90% of H2S.
In the industry, H2 is a by-product of sour natural gas sweetening, hydrodesul-
phurization of light hydrocarbons, and upgrading of heavy oils, bitumen and coals.
Since this H2S has a limited industrial application, it is viewed as a pollutant
requiring treatment and removal. Hydrogen sulphide has a high heating value, but
its use as a fuel is ruled out because sulphur dioxide is a product of H2S com-
bustion, which is environmentally unacceptable. At present, H2S is separated from
hydrocarbon gases by amine adsorption and regeneration, producing acid gas
containing 10–90% by volume of H2S. When concentrations of H2S exceed 40%,
this gas is treated by the Claus process in which H2S is oxidized to water and

sulphur. This process is uneconomical when the price of sulphur (the primary
product) is depressed; nevertheless, it is done to dispose of H2S in an environ-
mentally acceptable manner.
However, H2S has a much higher economic value if the hydrogen, as well as the
sulphur, could be recovered. Reﬁneries use hydrogen as a basic reagent in
hydrocracking and in hydrotreating, to produce fuels with low sulphur and low
aromatics content. Hydrogen is also used in the chemical industry, primarily in the
synthesis of ammonia and methanol. Most of the hydrogen currently consumed is
manufactured by steam methane reforming. This process requires large quantities
of natural gas as both the feed gas and combustion fuel, resulting in large amounts
of carbon dioxide being produced and discharged into the atmosphere, thus con-
tributing signiﬁcantly to the ‘greenhouse’ effect [1].
Reﬁning oil sands also produces a signiﬁcant amount of H2S; here again, the
Claus process is used, yielding sulphur and water. It is preferable to convert H2S to
sulphur and hydrogen within the reﬁnery and return the recovered hydrogen to the
heavy oil hydrogenation step. This would signiﬁcantly improve hydrogen
inventory and reduce associated CO2 emissions. For instance, the bitumen mined
from the oil sands deposits in the Athabasca area of Alberta, Canada, contains
4.4 wt% of sulphur. At present, conversion of this sulphur to H2S requires about
0.2 Mt/year of hydrogen. It is projected that by 2015, the amount of hydrogen
wasted to H2S will increase to 0.6 Mt/year, as the processing of bitumen will reach
3.261 Mbbl/day [2]. Replacement of that hydrogen by steam reforming of natural
gas is currently responsible for about 0.8 Mt/year of CO2 emissions. By 2015,
emissions will increase to 3 Mt/year of CO2.
Many processes were studied and proposed for the decomposition of H2S
including thermal [3–7] and thermochemical [8, 10–15, 57] decomposition; pho-
tochemistry [16–24]; plasma methods [25–27, 67]; electrolysis [9, 28–30]; and
electrochemical cycles [31–33]. These approaches are at various stages of
development covering numerous disciplines. However, none has yet been imple-
mented due to either cost or technical feasibility. This has prompted substantial
research in H2S decomposition with equilibrium shift by several methods such as
preferential removal of reaction products by membranes [12, 34–53] and thermal
diffusion columns [50–57]. The common drawback of all these proposed solutions
is the requirement for an external energy supply. Energy production, in most cases,
would cause CO2 emissions defying the concept of H2S being the source of clean
hydrogen. Also, any future technology developed to convert H2S to sulphur and
hydrogen must compete, both technically and economically, with current hydrogen
production processes and, simultaneously, compare favourably with the Claus
process for sulphur production.
In this chapter, the most popular approaches for hydrogen production from H2S
are reviewed before a novel open reactor architecture (OA) is presented, where the
coupling of reaction and hydrogen separation is achieved in the series of con-
secutive conventional catalytic reactors (CR), each followed by a membrane
separator (MS). Experimental study on the development of a suitable H2S
decomposition catalyst is also presented, and the theoretical calculations for one

CR/MS/CR unit predicting an overall one-pass H2S conversion close to 40% at
ambient pressure are discussed. Finally, a preliminary costing of the proposed
scheme that allows hydrogen production without CO2 emissions is summarized.
8.2 Thermodynamic and Reaction Kinetics Considerations
Hydrogen sulphide decomposition is a reversible reaction controlled by thermo-
dynamic equilibrium. The reaction is highly endothermic; as shown in Fig. 8.1, the
predicted conversion of thermally decomposed H2S based on thermodynamic
equilibrium is only about 20% at 1000C and 38% at 1200C. Temperatures
exceeding 1375C are needed to drive the H2S decomposition reaction to con-
versions above 50%.
Since the number of moles increases during H2S decomposition, the pressure
has a negative effect on conversion as shown in Fig. 8.2 and also reported by Faraji
et al. [58].
Also, the conversion is negatively inﬂuenced by the presence of one or both
products of H2S decomposition in the reaction mixture, especially H2, as shown in
Fig. 8.3.
At higher concentrations the hydrogen presence suppresses the H2S conversion
more signiﬁcantly than sulphur. Consequently, removal of hydrogen from the
reaction mixture should be more beneﬁcial for the process of H2S dissociation.
The kinetics of H2S dissociation reaction were studied extensively [3, 4, 7,
59–64]. Although the decomposition to S2 and H2 has often been used as the
representative reaction, other sulphur allotropes, sulphanes and HS are also
formed and need to be considered, especially at lower temperature, as recog-
nized by Raymont [3]. Detailed high-temperature kinetics of H2S decomposi-
tion pertinent to forward and reverse part of the reaction were reported by
Kaloidas et al. [4] and Dowling et al. [59], respectively. Although the estimated

values of the apparent activation energy were similar, there was a signiﬁcant
disagreement between the value of the Arrenhius factors and the order of the
rate equation found by these two investigations, leading to a difference of
roughly 25% between predicted conversions of dissociation and re-association
reactions. More recently, Hawboldt et al. [61] determined a new rate expression
for H2S dissociation/re-association reaction. The proposed rate expression is
r ¼ AfeEf=RTPH2SP0:5
S2  AreEr=RTPH2PS2
ð8:1Þ
where Af and Ef are 5260 (±260) mol/(cm3 s atm1.5) and 45.0 (±0.3) kcal/mol,
respectively, and Ar and Er are 14 (±1) mol/(cm3 s atm2) and 23.6 (±0.2)
kcal/mol.
It was determined that at temperatures below 1000C and residence durations
below 500 ms, the rate of H2S dissociation was insigniﬁcant. Furthermore, overall
conversions of H2S are low, even at long residence durations, at temperatures
below 950C.

8.3 H2S Decomposition Strategies
8.3.1 Thermal
It is widely recognized that the most direct process for converting H2S to hydrogen
and sulphur is catalytic or non-catalytic thermal decomposition [3–7]. However,
due to thermodynamic restrictions and the endothermic character of H2S disso-
ciation reaction, this approach is considered impractical as temperatures exceeding
1000C are needed to overcome these hurdles and achieve an industrially inter-
esting conversion. In addition, an unreacted H2S needs to be recycled to maximize
H2 yield, and the product gases must be separated by rapid quenching to block the
recombination of H2 and S2. Consequently, the cost of such a process is prohibitive
due to energy and exotic metallurgy requirements.
8.3.2 Thermochemical
The high energy requirement for H2S dissociation could be circumvented by a
series of less energy intensive steps involving sulphiding of a metal, or a lower
sulphide to liberate the hydrogen and then calcining the higher sulphide to
decompose into sulphur and the original metal or sulphide, as described by Chivers
et al. [8]. The use of alkali metal sulphides and polysulphides were studied by
Chivers and Lau [13]. Vanadium sulphide cycles were studied by Al-Shamma and
Naman [10] and Chivers and lau [57]. Although the achieved hydrogen yields were
higher when compared to direct thermal decomposition, it should be noted that
polysulphides are very corrosive and difﬁcult to handle above 650C. Also, it was
observed by Luinstra [11] that the diffusion mass transfer limits the efﬁciency of
the metal sulphide-based processes.
Open loop thermochemical cycles that employ carbon oxides or hydrocarbons
were proposed by Raymont [12], but gas separation was problematic.
Marathon Oil developed a thermochemical process based on the oxidizing
ability of t-butylanthraquinone [14] and further studied by Mark et al. [15] who
employed computational chemistry using semi-empirical methods to determine the
detailed chemical steps of the process occurring through S8 formation.
At this stage, none of the thermochemical cycles described in the literature has
reached commercial development.
8.3.3 Electrochemical
Gregory et al. [9] concluded that because of low speciﬁc conductance and a low
dielectric constant of liquid H2S, production of hydrogen by direct electrolysis
seems impractical. Electrolysis in water solution was studied by Bolmer [28, 29]
8
Membrane-Assisted Catalytic Cracking of Hydrogen Sulphide
165
and Johnson [30]. Since it was determined that the number of ionic species in H2S
water solution was too small to obtain satisfactory rates of H2S dissociation, a
supporting acidic or basic electrolytes were used to raise the conductance of the
solution. However, elemental sulphur produced by the electrolysis is a good
insulator, causing a substantial increase in the power demand and lowering the
electrolysis efﬁciency with time, which makes this approach impractical.
Indirect electrolysis of H2S using acidic or basic iodine to oxidize H2S was
studied by Kalina et al. [31] However, the acidic process suffered from loss of
iodine and formation of impure, sticky plastic sulphur. The basic process gave low
sulphur yields but had excessive oxidant consumption and high electrical energy
requirements.
The direct or indirect electrolysis of H2S produces high purity hydrogen, but the
high cost of electricity makes these methods uneconomical at the present time for
hydrogen production on a commercial scale.
8.3.4 Solar
The use of solar energy for experimental studies on H2S uncatalysed thermolysis
indicated that a high degree of chemical conversion was attainable and that the
reverse reaction during quench was negligible [6, 65, 66]. The recommended
process temperature would be between 1300 and 1500C. However, a preliminary
economic assessment indicated that the capital cost of a plant employing effusion
to separate H2 and H2S would be up to ten times higher than a similar capacity
Claus plant.
8.3.5 Photochemical
Most attempts to dissociate H2S photolytically involve irradiating an alkaline
solution of the gas in which semiconductor particles are suspended. Cadmium
sulphide, ruthenium dioxide/cadmium sulphide, titanium dioxide, chromium,
platinum, and vanadium sulphides were used [16–18] as the semiconductor which
participates by absorbing the incident quanta of light.
A recent review [19, 22] on stratiﬁed photocatalyst CdS (nanoparticles arranged
into capsule form), catalyzing the decomposition of H2S into H2 and S claimed
that H2S can be directly split into hydrogen and sulphur on photocatalysts com-
posed of CdS-based semiconductors loaded with noble metals and noble metal
sulphides, using nonaqueous ethanolamine solvent as the reaction media. The
quantum efﬁciency in hydrogen production can be as high as 30% under visible
light irradiation. None of these materials improved hydrogen production signiﬁ-
cantly, and the efﬁciency of processes using light to dissociate H2S to hydrogen
and sulphur was approximately 3%.
166
J. Galuszka et al.
8.3.6 Plasma
The use of plasma reactors to dissociate H2S was reported by Argyle et al. [25].
It was claimed that the energy efﬁciency of the processes was low, presumably
because many successive dissociation–recombination processes served only to
recreate the reactant H2S and produced heat before H2 is ﬁnally formed as a
product. The calculated energy requirements of 0.5–200 eV/molecule of H2S
converted was many times higher than the theoretical minimum of *0.2 eV/
molecule H2S (21 kJ/mol H2S) based on the enthalpy of formation of H2S at 298 K.
Breakdown voltages of H2S in four balance gases (Ar, He, N2 and H2) were
studied by Zhaoa et al. [67] who concluded that no thermal plasmas are effective
for dissociating H2S into hydrogen and sulphur, but further increases in energy
efﬁciency are necessary. It was emphasized by Thomas [26] that an understanding
of the reaction parameter space, which includes pulse frequency, discharge
capacitance and voltage, reactor residence time and electrode material, is vital to
optimize reactor performance and energy efﬁciency.
Until now, plasmas have not been used for any large scale chemical processing.
The biggest obstacle possibly is the high consumption of electrical energy.
However, the plasma process is environmentally friendly and operationally simple
with minimum waste generation.
8.3.7 Microwaves
Application of microwave radiation to heterogeneous catalytic systems was
reviewed by Roussy and Pearce [68]. Comparison of the effect of microwave and
conventional heating on catalytic decomposition of H2S into hydrogen and sulphur,
carried out on impregnated and mechanically mixed MoS2/c-alumina (both 30% by
weight MoS2) was investigated by Zhang and Hayward [69, 70]. It was concluded
that the calculated equilibrium conversion based on thermodynamic data of
Kaloidas and Papayannakas [71] for the conventional thermal reaction correlated
with the equilibrium data, whereas the reaction carried out in the microwave cavity
achieved conversion higher than that expected by thermodynamics.
8.3.8 Membrane-Assisted Conversion
Thermal catalytic decomposition of H2S to hydrogen and sulphur is a good can-
didate for application of a membrane reactor. The expected signiﬁcant process
simpliﬁcation and intensiﬁcation would capitalize on a new industrial paradigm
offered by membrane reactors that allows combining reaction and separation in
one step. A common feature of all catalytic membrane reactors having a hydrogen
8
Membrane-Assisted Catalytic Cracking of Hydrogen Sulphide
167
permselective membrane wall is the ability of such a reactor to circumvent ther-
modynamic limitations of an equilibrium-controlled process, by separating H2 as it
is produced. Therefore, it is expected that membranes with high selectivity and
permeability towards hydrogen—if successfully integrated with advanced cata-
lysts—would make H2S dissociation commercially feasible, by enabling hydrogen
production at a much lower temperature with greater intensity.
Both ceramic and composite metal hydrogen permselective membranes were
considered for the separation of hydrogen from H2S. However, the practical
application of these membranes has some restrictions. The noble metal membranes
are affected by chemical attack by H2S and their use entails considerable cost.
Separation by mesoporous membranes governed by Knudsen diffusion (pore size
2–50 nm) provides insufﬁcient selectivity towards hydrogen. Microporous silica
hydrogen permselective membranes (H-membranes) have also been extensively
studied [72] as a potentially more practical alternative to Pd membranes. Chemical
vapour deposition (CVD) and the sol–gel method are the most commonly used
techniques for fabricating silica membranes. These state-of-the-art silica mem-
branes have good hydrogen ﬂux and separation and respectable thermal stability.
However, hydrothermal stability of silica H-membrane is a key factor in deter-
mining its suitability for a commercial application for membrane-assisted pro-
cesses [72].
The application of a membrane reactor with a hydrogen permselective mem-
brane to intensify H2S decomposition to hydrogen and sulphur at a lower tem-
perature was ﬁrst considered in the eighties [50, 73, 74]. However, the expected
positive effects on H2S conversion observed with the early Vycor-based mem-
branes were insigniﬁcant. Also, a zirconia–silica membrane developed more
recently and applied to decomposition of H2S by Ohashi et al. [75] had only
Knudsen selectivity and produced similar results.
A catalytic membrane reactor having a tubular ceramic membrane for H2S
decomposition was patented by Vizoso [76]. It was claimed that applying a
membrane reactor between 400 and 700C, with the molybdenum sulphide cata-
lyst deposited directly on the surface of the ceramic membrane, resulted in a 20%
increase in the conversion of a 4% H2S stream, though few details were provided.
The most recent application of a silica membrane—prepared by counter-
diffusion CVD of TMOS and oxygen—to H2S decomposition was reported by
Akamatsu et al. [77]. With this membrane and a commercial desulphurization
catalyst at 600C, about 70% H2S diluted in 99% nitrogen was converted, in
a relatively short residence time of 7 s. Nonetheless, this claim is not supported by
a material balance, and the amount of hydrogen passing through the membrane in a
very diluted feed stream is not reported.
A multilayer metallic membrane reactor for H2S decomposition was patented
by Edlund and Friesen [78] and, later, further described by Edlund and Pledger
[79, 80]. The membrane consisted of three distinct layers: a base-metal/mechanical
support layer, an intermediate layer and a coating-metal layer. The coating metal
was a H2-permeable metal resistant to chemical corrosion by H2S (e.g. Pd alloyed
with about 40% Cu). It was reported that at 700C, the membrane-assisted
168
J. Galuszka et al.
thermolysis of 1.5% of H2S in nitrogen under a total pressure of about 8 atm was
practically driven to completion, whereas the equilibrium conversion under similar
conditions without hydrogen removal was only 13%. However, the required
contact time to reach this conversion was about 12 min, which is impractical.
The practicality of Pd membrane application to H2S decomposition was the
subject of several studies. Morreale et al. [37] evaluated the effect of H2S on the
hydrogen permeance of Pd–Cu alloys at temperatures above 600C. It was claimed
that the face-centred cubic stability region of the Pd–Cu alloy is least affected by
the presence of 1000 ppm H2S. The greatest effect of H2S on hydrogen permeance
occurred at the lowest temperatures of about 300C, which corresponded to the
body-centred cubic crystalline phase of the alloy. This agrees with other studies
[38–40], suggesting that at the high temperature some Pd–Cu compositions may
tolerate impurity levels of 1000 ppm H2S.
Recently, Pd–Nb alloys were investigated by Aboud et al. [41]. Niobium shows
resistance to sulphur poisoning and has the highest hydrogen permeability that
could be an order of magnitude higher than pure Pd. Unfortunately, it was
determined that Nb is notorious for undergoing hydrogen embrittlement and its
presence can be a major structural issue.
Clearly, further development and newer strategies are needed before a suc-
cessful and practical application of a membrane reactor to hydrogen production
through catalytic H2S decomposition can be claimed.
8.4 H2S Decomposition Catalyst Development
Owing to the inherent slowness of H2S thermal decomposition (about 15 s is
needed to reach steady-state conditions at 1100C [3]), substantial effort was made
to develop a catalyst that would promote decomposition reaction at lower tem-
peratures. Since H2S, even at very low concentrations in the ppm range, exhibits a
strong poisoning effect on many metal-based catalysts [81], hydrodesulphuration
catalysts known for their resistance to H2S poisoning were considered and
investigated for H2S decomposition. Among these, molybdenum disulphide and
tungsten disulphide were found to be very effective for the decomposition of H2S.
The following activity order determined experimentally in the temperature range
of 180–420C was reported [12, 82, 83]:
CoS2 [ NiS ¼ WS2 [ MoS2 [ FeS2 [ Ag2S [ CuS [ CdS [ MnS [ ZnS:
Chivers et al. [8] compared the catalytic activity of some metal sulphide
powders, and for the series Cr2S3, MoS2 and WS2, it was found that MoS2 is the
most active catalyst at T C 600C, but Cr2S3 and WS2 demonstrated greater yield
of hydrogen at T B 600C than MoS2.
The catalytic activity tests for H2S decomposition carried out at the Chemical
and Food Engineering Department of the University of Salerno (UNISA), showed
8

interesting results at a relatively low temperature of 900C and in a practical range
of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) between 5000 and 100000 h-1. Quartz chips
as inert and four different catalyst formulations were tested that included Al2O3
fresh and calcined at 800C, MoS2 powder, and alumina supported Pt and MoS2
between 700 and 1000C and in the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) range of
20000–900000 h-1. The total feed ﬂow rate was between 0.25 and 1.2 l/min
(STP), and H2S was diluted in N2 giving compositions between 5 and 100% at
atmospheric pressure.
Figure 8.4 shows H2S conversions as a function of temperature for the feed
stream containing 10% H2S in N2. It is clear that at the GHSV of 50000 h-1 in the
temperature range of 600–1000C all the studied catalysts were able to accelerate
the H2S decomposition. In particular, both the MoS2 supported on alumina and
the pure calcined alumina gave conversions close to equilibrium, although, in the
temperature range of 700–900C, the MoS2/Al2O3 performed better.
Figure 8.5 shows the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) inﬂuence on H2S
conversions studied at 800 and 900C for the feed stream containing 10% H2S in
N2 tested for the same selection of catalysts. Since the H2S conversions with quartz
chips were below 2%, they were not included in Fig. 8.5.
The 10% MoS2/Al2O3 catalyst showed the best performance at 900C, as H2S
conversions were in a narrow range between 21 and 25% for a wide range of
GSHV between 5000 and 700000 h-1. The lowest contact time was about 5 ms
corresponding to GHSV of 700000 h-1. All the other catalysts were able to bring
the system to near equilibrium but in a much narrower range of GHSV.
At 800C, again, the 10% MoS2/Al2O3 catalyst gave the best results but
equilibrium conversion was not reached. At GHSV of 18000 h-1 (contact time of
0.2 s) the conversion was 14%. At the longest contact time below GHSV of
5000 h-1, the observed conversion decrease is caused most likely by the recom-
bination reaction between hydrogen and sulphur, as these products of H2S
decomposition were not removed fast enough from the reaction zone. It was
veriﬁed that during 20 h on stream, the deactivation of the 10% MoS2/Al2O3
catalyst was not detectable and, at 900C and contact time of 5 ms, it gave a
desirable 25% of H2S conversion.

8.5 Novel Process Conﬁguration
The proposed process conﬁguration for a membrane-assisted decomposition of
H2S to hydrogen and sulphur is shown schematically in Fig. 8.6. The single sec-
tion contains two conventional CRs and one MS placed between them, forming the
so-called open membrane reactor architecture (OA). Therefore, the coupling of
reaction and hydrogen separation would be achieved in a series of the consecutive
CR each followed by the MS unit (CRMS). The number of the CRMS units would
be determined by the required feed conversion. Such membrane-assisted reaction
architecture simpliﬁes the design, allowing the hydrogen separator made of silica
membranes to perform at its optimal temperature of 600C, while the catalytic H2S
decomposition proceeds in the CRs at about 900C.
The conventional membrane architecture (CA), the one where the catalyst is
placed within the wall of the membrane, is the most studied on the laboratory scale
and most frequently reported in the literature. However, the application of the
conventional architecture to H2S decomposition is limited by the current ceramic
membrane thermal stability [72] and a mismatch between the membrane perfor-
mance, in terms of ﬂow through and the heat ﬂux, which could be applied to the
catalytic tubes. Such imbalance would, from an engineering point of view, require
a large and impractical heat transfer surface.
The performance of a single OA section was simulated using Excel Solver for
the 10% MoS2/Al2O3 catalyst developed at UNISA and a ceramic hydrogen
permselective membrane developed at CanmetENERGY and described recently
by Galuszka and Giddings [72]. All calculations assumed thermodynamically

allowable conversions; the ﬁve stream compositions shown in Fig. 8.6 were
considered.
The feed stream containing 10% of H2S in nitrogen enters the ﬁrst CR operated
at 900C, where 25% of H2S is converted to hydrogen and sulphur as thermo-
dynamically allowed and experimentally conﬁrmed at UNISA laboratories.
Sulphur is condensed at the exit of the ﬁrst CR and the remaining products are fed
to the tube side of the MS where part of hydrogen is removed through the
membrane and recovered as a hydrogen-rich stream. The hydrogen- and sulphur-
depleted stream containing unreacted H2S, N2 and remaining H2, is fed to the
second CR reactor.
The stream exiting the MS and entering the second CR may contain between 0
and 2.5% of hydrogen, depending on the efﬁciency of the MS module. If all H2
produced in the ﬁrst CR is removed in the MS, then the plant containing the two
CRs and one MS, will give a net combined H2S conversion of 43.75%. It needs to
be noted that the sulphur removal alone after the ﬁrst CR contributes to the overall
conversion increase by approximately 5%.
The effectiveness of the MS module depends on H2 membrane permeance,
separation and pressure difference across the membrane (DP). Consequently, to
keep DP at its maximum value, the partial pressure of hydrogen on the outside of
the membrane should be as low as possible. Hydrogen would, therefore, be swept
from the outside surface by employing a ﬂow of a non-reactive gas, such as steam
or be pumped away. For a ﬁxed (DP), the dependence of the amount of hydrogen
removed by the MS membrane and the total achievable H2S conversion on H2
permeance were calculated and are shown in Figs. 8.7 and 8.8.
A catalyst placement inside the MS module working at 600C could be con-
sidered. At this temperature, an equilibrium conversion for the H2S decomposition
reaction is about 3%. If equilibrium is reached inside the MS containing the
catalyst, then an additional shift towards the H2S decomposition products will be
expected.

8.6 Practical Realization: Preliminary Technical
Analysis and Economics
The most important element for the practical realization of the proposed mem-
brane-assisted H2S decomposition process is the use of the Claus process to
generate heat for the thermal decomposition of H2S and the use of a lower tem-
perature thermal decomposition, coupled with permeable membrane separation to
allow lower temperatures to be employed throughout. Residual H2S would be
disposed of during the Claus process; its heat content would be used as a partial or
complete energy source for the process according to the following reaction:
H2S þ heat $ H2 þ 1
2 S2
ð8:2Þ
10H2S þ 5O2 $ 2H2S þ SO2 þ 7
2 S2 þ 8H2O þ heat
ð8:3Þ
Consequently, relatively inexpensive materials may be used for the apparatus,
and there would normally be no requirement for external energy and no generation
of carbon dioxide.
The decomposition gas leaving the reactor would normally be quenched, i.e.
quickly reduced in temperature, to avoid back reaction of hydrogen and sulphur in
the decomposition gas, which may take place if the gas is allowed to cool slowly.
This can be achieved by passing the decomposition gas through a suitable heat
exchanger.
Before ultimately burning the residual H2S in the thermal step, the decompo-
sition gas containing unreacted H2S would be heated at least one more time to the
decomposition temperature of up to about 1000C by heat generated in the thermal
step, followed each time by further separation of hydrogen in the MS module.
A three-step CRMS conﬁguration for the novel process is shown in Fig. 8.9.

A stream containing 75% H2S would be compressed to 8 atm, preheated to
550C downstream of the third module, before entering the ﬁrst reaction step
consisting of ﬁxed bed catalytic tubes. These CR tubes are immersed in the Claus
reaction chamber, where heat is exchanged with the Claus gases and the H2S
stream to provide the energy required to carry out the H2S decomposition reaction.
The proposed H2S decomposition catalytic CR has a non-conventional, the so-
called regenerative geometry. The gaseous products of the H2S decomposition
leave the bottom of the CR at 960C through an internal riser, as shown in
Fig. 8.10. This conﬁguration allows for heat exchange between the decomposition
gases and fresh stream, reducing the temperature of the product stream to 600C
and the overall heat duty of the process.
The product stream, containing H2S, H2, and S2, leaves through the top of the
CR and is at the right temperature to enter the ﬁrst MS module directly. Hydrogen
is removed in the MS module, and the retentate is cooled to the dew point tem-
perature to separate sulphur; it enters the second CRMS at 550C. Again, the
decomposition gas leaves the second CR at 600C, enters the second MS where
hydrogen is removed, is cooled down to separate sulphur and recycled to the third
and ﬁnal reaction step. The decomposition gas leaving the third CR at 600C, is
then routed to the third MS to remove hydrogen, cooled down to separate sulphur
and recycled to the Claus reactor to treat the unconverted H2S and produce the
required reaction heat through the Claus process.
Operating conditions, temperature, pressure, removal rate etc., of the three
CRMS units are set to generate the partial pressure of hydrogen high enough to
facilitate an optimal H2 separation through a membrane and the H2S conversion,

which is sustainable with the heat and the temperature generated in the Claus
reactor.
Hydrogen streams are cooled, compressed and further cooled before a ﬁnal
puriﬁcation with a dedicated Pressure Swing Adsorber (PSA) to correct less than
ideal hydrogen selectivity of silica membranes. The PSA polisher would be able to
achieve hydrogen purity in excess of 99.999%.
In the proposed scheme, the heat used for the decomposition process in the
Claus reactor reduces the amount of medium pressure steam available at battery
limits. However, since no natural gas is used for hydrogen production, the process
does not emit any CO2.

Main process parameters used for the techno-economical comparison are
summarized in Table 8.1, where the novel process is compared with a conven-
tional Claus unit ? tail gas treatment (TGT) and steam methane reforming (SMR)
for hydrogen production.
Key economic parameters used to evaluate the novel process are shown in
Table 8.2. A simple approach, based on the overall operating cost, was used to
compare the conventional with the proposed CRMS technology.
The investment cost was estimated using a standard estimating tool and Tec-
nimont KT’s long-standing experience with building Claus sulphur units and
hydrogen plants.
For the membrane-assisted process evaluation, a 200 ton/day unit was con-
sidered together with the costs to modify the Claus reaction chamber by inserting
the catalytic tubes. The cost of separation modules, vessels, exchangers and
rotating machinery was also added. Table 8.3 reported the estimated equipment
costs. For the overall investment cost, a 250% or 2.5 multiplying factor was used,
which is commonly adopted for similar estimates.
8.6.1 Variable Operating Costs (VOC)
The proposed process is penalized by the extra power consumed and the loss of a
part of MP steam, when compared to the conventional process of natural gas
consumption and associated CO2 emissions. Table 8.4 shows a comparison of the
extra variable operating costs (VOC) for both cases. Owing to the impact of
natural gas costs, the difference between the two schemes is considerable, more
than 1.3 MM€ in favour of the membrane-assisted scheme.

8.6.2 Overall Operation Costs
In Table 8.5, the overall investment costs and depreciation were reported. At this
early stage, modiﬁcations required to the Claus unit are not completely mastered;
however, a sizable difference between the two schemes emerges, and the novel
scheme has a slightly better yearly depreciation.
Table 8.6 presents the overall change in operating costs. For the O&M of the
MS modules, complete replacement once every 4 years was considered. A pre-
dicted difference of 2.175 MM€/year in operational costs, which represents a 13%
reduction, is an appealing ﬁgure, considering that of the O&M costs, the mem-
brane replacement cost comprises a substantial portion.

Sensitivity analysis using the cost of membrane as parameter is shown in
Fig. 8.11. To nullify the operating cost difference, the membrane modules’ cost
must rise signiﬁcantly to a unit cost of almost 6500 €/m2.
It is likely that advances in membrane technology and production will further
reduce the above ﬁgures, thereby increasing the differential production cost and
making the novel process even more attractive.

Alkanes Dehydrogenation
Moshe Sheintuch and David S. A. Simakov
9.1 Process Description
Light alkenes (oleﬁns) are among the most important intermediate products in
chemical industry, e.g., ethylene is required for the production of polyethylenes
and polyvinylchlorides. Nowadays, light oleﬁns are commonly obtained by steam
cracking (SC) and ﬂuid catalytic cracking (FCC) of light oil fractions. For
example, most propylene is produced as co-product in steam crackers (
[
55%) and
as by-product in FCC units (*35%), while only small fraction (
\
10%) is pro-
duced by alternative technologies, such as propane dehydrogenation. For ethane
dehydrogenation, *84% selectivity and *54% ethane conversion are commonly
obtained by SC at 800C. As both SC and FCC require high temperatures, coking
and side reactions are among major drawbacks (SC and FCC are highly endo-
thermic processes with extensive coke formation).
Catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) becomes a growing branch in petrochemical
industry, as a route to obtain alkenes from low-cost feedstocks of saturated
hydrocarbons. Catalytic dehydrogenation is currently a well-established com-
mercial route for production of a number of important light oleﬁns, e.g., propene.
As compared to conventional cracking technologies, catalytic DH may provide
better selectivity at lower temperatures, lowering also the coke deposition rate.
In general, DH of parafﬁns is an endothermic equilibrium reaction, with conver-
sions increasing with decreasing pressure and increasing temperature. Process
temperature increases with decreasing carbon number to maintain conversion for a
given pressure. The main side reaction that occurs during the DH process is
cracking, which is primarily thermal in nature and results in the undesirable
products and in coke formation. Another side reaction, which occurs during DH of
isobutene, is the isomerization to the normal form.

Temperatures as high as 900 and 750C are required to achieve a conversion
of 90% for ethane and propane at equilibrium, respectively (at atmospheric
pressure). To obtain 70% conversion, the corresponding temperatures are 790
and 660C.
9.1.1 Traditional Process Drawbacks
In general, DH of light alkanes (ethane, propane, butane, etc.) suffers from several
common limitations: (i) thermodynamic restrictions on conversion, which imply
high temperatures to obtain reasonable conversions; (ii) strong endothermicity,
which requires heat supply, and several approaches for that purpose are described
in the following sections; (iii) side reactions like thermal cracking, isomerization,
and butadiene production, which become important at high residence times; and
(iv) coke formation due to the high temperatures. Coking is one of the major
reasons for catalyst deactivation, which is extremely fast (
\
1 h in industrial
applications). As a result, catalytic-bed reactors have to be regenerated every short
period of time (tens of minutes), to burn off the deposited carbon.
An additional mechanism of deactivation, due to catalyst particle agglomera-
tion (sintering), leads to reduction in active speciﬁc surface area and, as a result,
catalyst activity. Obviously, such deactivated catalytic pellets cannot be regener-
ated just by combustion of hydrocarbons over the deactivated catalytic bed (like in
case of coking); this type of deactivation is rather irreversible. Moreover, periodic
regenerations of the catalytic bed (to burn off deposited coke) make the sintering
deactivation even more severe.
Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes helps to overcome
(at least partially) some inherent drawbacks of non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
Oxidative dehydrogenation reduces the process endothermicity and shifts the
equilibrium toward alkenes generation, offering better conversions and selectivity.
However, ODH suffers from its own drawbacks: (i) catalyst selection, as catalyst
should be active for both oxidation and DH; (ii) insufﬁcient selectivity; (iii) loss of
hydrogen, which is a valuable by-product (inherent feature of ODH); (iv) ﬂam-
mability of the reactive mixture; (v) heat removal; and (vi) reaction runaways. The
catalyst also should withstand high temperatures if hot spots emerge in a ﬁxed bed
as a result of addition of oxygen. Introduction of an oxidant to the process obvi-
ously raises safety concerns: heat has to be removed and a control is necessary to
prevent runaways.

9.1.2 Dehydrogenation Catalysts
Catalytic DH is normally performed in tubular packed-bed reactors (PBR).
Alumina-supported chromia (Cr2O3/Al2O3) is the most common DH catalyst for
commercial applications, due to its high activity and selectivity. In isobutane DH,
conversions of *55% and selectivities higher than 90% are normally obtained in
industrial plants at temperatures below 600C and nearly atmospheric pressure;
the catalyst is regenerated every few hours [1]. The activity of Cr-based DH
catalysts is dependent on the Cr loading; it is also affected by the process
conditions, mainly temperature and time-on-stream [1]. For small Cr loadings, the
DH activity increases almost linearly with Cr loading, whereas for high loadings
(5–10 wt% Cr) the activity remains similar or even decreases. Unfortunately, the
c-alumina support (which is widely employed for commercial applications)
catalyzes the side reactions of cracking and coking, resulting in fast catalyst
deactivation. For example, in the propane DH, propane conversions of *50% and
selectivity to propylene of *90% are normally obtained in the beginning of
operation (at *600C and atmospheric pressure), but the conversion drops to
*40% in just several hours of operation [2, 3]. The deactivation is mainly
attributed to the formation of coke. A constant DH activity for a certain period of
time may be achieved by gradual increase of temperature during the operation.
Other supports with different acidic characteristics and the addition of alkali or
alkaline-earth metals and other promoters are used [2, 3]. For example, the
addition of tin (Sn), which affects the amount of the oxidized chromium, results in
a signiﬁcant decrease of the amount of deposited coke. The Sn addition also
improves selectivity, but, unfortunately, reduces catalytic activity [3]. Alternative
catalysts are extensively investigated and some of them are already in commercial
use (e.g., Pt-based).
Alumina-supported
platinum-based
catalysts
(Pt/Al2O3)
have
also
been
successfully employed for light parafﬁns DH. The main drawback is again deacti-
vation, which is related not only to coking, but also to sintering. Promoters that can
suppress carbon deposition or/and provide a strong interaction between Pt particles
and promoter or support are of great importance. The deactivation due to coke
formation can be prevented by the addition of various promoters. Bimetallic
Pt-based catalysts supported on a-alumina (rather than traditionally employed
c-alumina) with the addition of promoters, such as indium and tin, provide high
activity, selectivity, and stability and much smaller coke formation (decreased by a
factor of 30–60) during DH of butane [4]. In propane DH, conversions of 40–50%
and selectivity to propylene of 85–90% can be achieved at 2 bar and 570–580C,
using these catalysts [4]. There are evidences that the addition of Ce and Zn pro-
moters could improve thermal stability of Pt/c-Al2O3, enhancing platinum particles
ability to resist to agglomeration [5]. Ce and Zn promoters improve chemisorption of
hydrogen, maintaining catalyst activity; Zn also promotes propylene desorption,
decreasing the degree of coking, and increasing the selectivity of propylene in
propane DH (99% propylene selectivity for 35–40% propane conversion at 580C).

where Pi is the partial pressure of a specie i. This expression accounts for the
inhibition due to adsorption of products or reactants or due to coke precursors.
The kinetics of isobutane dehydrogenation on pellets of 0.35% Pt/c-Al2O3, with or
without addition of Sn or In promoters, was investigated by Lyu et al. [6, 7].
At temperatures between 500 and 600C the reaction was found to be kinetic-
controlled and the rate followed (9.2) with
D ¼ Pi¼C4 þ k00ðpH2Þ1=2 þ k000Ccoke
ð9:3Þ
The inhibition due to the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst was
determined in a transient regime, due to deactivation, and the rate of coke for-
mation was found to be proportional to isobutene pressure and inhibited by
increasing hydrogen pressure. In a certain domain the rate of coke formation and
destruction followed
rC ¼ k1Pi¼C4  k2pH2Ccoke
ð
Þ=D
ð9:4Þ
with D given by Eq. 9.3.
While these results were obtained with relatively large hydrogen pressures and
small conversions, the suggested expression provides a good qualitative model for
the effect of hydrogen pressure.
Catalysts based on other metals, such as gallium and vanadium oxides, can be
also employed in DH processes [8, 9]. For example, silica-supported gallium oxide
catalyst has been found to be moderately active, but quite selective in propane
dehydrogenation (up to 80%) and results in much less coking, *1/10 of that using
a silica-supported chromium oxide [8]. There is an extensive research aimed to
ﬁnd new DH catalysts that will perform well at moderate temperatures, suffer less
from coke deposition and maintain catalytic activity for long periods of time
without regeneration.
Some of the limitations of the DH reactions can be overcome by the catalytic
ODH. Various oxidizing agents can be used for ODH, e.g., air, oxygen, sulfur
compounds, and halogens. The introduction of an oxidant into the DH reaction
mixture makes it less endothermic and, therefore, the process can be performed at
much lower temperatures. This in turn reduces the extent of side reactions, such as
thermal cracking. Moreover, the DH thermodynamic limitations can be overcome,
since removal of hydrogen from the reactive mixture (by oxidizing H2 to water)
shifts the equilibrium toward formation of products (alkenes). Though ODH offers
some advantages with regard to reducing side reactions and overcoming equilibrium
restrictions, it offers a relatively low selectivity and suffers from problems of
ﬂammability of the reaction mixture and reaction runaways; therefore, issues such
as heat removal and optimization of oxidant-to-feed ratio are crucial for this process.
186
M. Sheintuch and D. S. A. Simakov
In ODH of light alkanes, such as propane, butane and isobutane, vanadium-based
catalysts are commonly employed. Various types of supports and promoters
(V2O5/ZrO2, VOx/TiO2, V–Mg–O, VOx/c-Al2O3 and many others) can be
used
[10].
Other
catalysts
(e.g.,
Ni-based,
Mo-based)
can
also
be
employed [10–12]. Signiﬁcant progress has been done in the search for catalysts
suitable for ODH, especially of ethane and propane. In the case of ethane, as
reported in the literature ethylene yields are comparable to those obtained by SC,
or even much better. Selectivities of 40–80% at conversions of 40–60% are
normally reported for a relatively moderate temperature range of *400–600C
using both V-based and other catalysts [12]. Some catalysts demonstrate a superior
performance of ethylene selectivities of 80–90% at ethane conversions of up to
80% (in the same temperature range). For other alkanes, the reported yields are
still signiﬁcantly lower that those obtained in conventional processes (for propane
ODH, up to *60–80% selectivity at *40–50% conversion is obtainable [12]).
For low vanadium loadings (*0–6 wt% V), the activity of the V-based catalysts is
increased with V loading, however, the selectivity shows a maximum for the
intermediate loadings (in the same range). For example, in ethane ODH, the
maximum ethane conversion of *80% was found for 6 wt% V loading (at 570C),
while the maximum in ethylene selectivity (60%) was obtained for 5 wt% V, at
ethane conversion of only 20% [13].
9.1.3 Industrial Applications
A number of catalytic DH technologies have been commercialized over the last
decade and are reviewed below. Among the main processes currently used in the
industry are CATOFIN, Ole-ﬂexTM, and STAR [14]. The CATOFIN dehy-
drogenation process, a proven route for the production of isobutylene and
propylene, uses chromia-alumina catalyst ﬁxed-bed reactors in a cyclic reaction-
regeneration operation with a regeneration cycle of 20–30 min. During the
hydrocarbon processing step, the feed is vaporized and raised to reaction tem-
perature by exchange with various process streams and using a heater. The off-
gas, which is a hydrogen-rich, can be sent to a pressure swing adsorption (PSA)
unit to purify the hydrogen. Since the reactor temperature drops signiﬁcantly
during the reaction step, auxiliary equipment is required for the regeneration
step, which is necessary to prepare the off-line reactors for the next reaction
step.
The STAR process is also performed in ﬁxed beds, over noble metal (Pt)
supported by zinc and calcium aluminate and impregnated with various metals, but
it is an ODH process. The catalyst maintains its activity for DH and is stable in the
presence of steam and oxygen. The STAR process was proven for several appli-
cations, among them ODH of propane to propylene and ODH of butanes.
The Ole-ﬂex process is a catalytic DH, performed in a multiple-stage unit
including four radial-ﬂow reactors packed with Pt-based catalyst, with charge and
9

inter-stage heaters and feed-efﬂuent heat exchangers. The process also includes a
selective hydrogenation unit to eliminate dioleﬁns and acetylenes.
9.2 Membrane Integration
The use of a hydrogen selective membrane for equilibrium-limited processes, such
as DH, is a logical choice. Successful implementation of membrane reactors has a
potential of replacing the currently used periodically regenerated ﬁxed-bed reac-
tors. Continuous removal of hydrogen by membrane separation should increase the
DH conversion for a given temperature, providing also hydrogen, which is a
valuable by-product. This in turn will allow operation at lower temperatures,
therefore, reducing the coke formation and side reactions. On the other hand, using
of H2 selective membrane may results in extremely low H2 partial pressures in the
reaction mixture, leading to low selectivities and even increasing deactivation.
Therefore, introduction of H2 separation membranes into DH process should be
supported by detailed analysis and process optimization.
9.2.1 Membranes for Hydrogen Separation
Metallic membranes, (Pd–Ag) alloys, are typically used for separation of H2, either
as an unsupported foil or a supported thin ﬁlm. In these membranes, the hydrogen
transport is by adsorption and atomic dissociation on one side of the membrane,
dissolution in the membrane, followed by diffusion, and ﬁnally desorption (on the
other side). Due to the H2 dissociation step, H2 separation is driven by a trans-
membrane difference of the square roots of the hydrogen partial pressures. The
preparation technologies of both unsupported and supported Pd–Ag membranes
are well developed and such membranes are commercially available. Since the
membrane reformer performance is limited by separation capability, optimization
of membrane permeability is one of the important issues.
In early works Pd unsupported foil membranes of thickness of *70 lm were
employed [15], giving rather moderate hydrogen ﬂuxes. These membranes
were used in commercial hydrogen separation units. However, further decrease of
the foil thickness was challenging, since membranes became too fragile for the
conditions of high temperature catalytic processes.
The search for a high permeability at low cost have led to the development of
membranes composed of an ultrathin Pd–Ag layer (
\
10 lm) on a ceramic or
stainless steel porous supports [16–18]. They combine the inﬁnite selectivity to
hydrogen of the dense Pd–Ag ﬁlm with a mechanical strength of the porous
support, which resistance to hydrogen transfer is negligible. These membranes are
very promising, since they exhibit remarkably high ﬂuxes [0.5–2.5 mol/(m2 s),
188
M. Sheintuch and D. S. A. Simakov
which is much higher than that of Pd–Ag foil membranes] and require relatively
small quantities of Pd for their manufacturing.
Pinholes formation that can occur during the membrane fabrication or during
the operation is still one of the major drawbacks. Membrane poisoning may be
caused by strong adsorption of certain compounds (e.g., CO) and by coke depo-
sition on the membrane surface, which is particularly relevant for DH processes.
These shortcomings may lead to long-term hydrogen ﬂux degradation and even to
the membrane failure. There is still not enough information to quantitatively
describe these effects.
Extensive research for substitutes for the expensive Pd membrane has been
conducted. Porous membranes that consist of a highly porous metal or ceramic
support with a thin top layer, tailored to have the desired selectivity, yield quite a
high permeability but a relatively low selectivity. Some of the applications that
have been tested on porous silica, vycor, alumina, and other membranes are listed
in Saracco and Specchia [19] and Hsieh [20]. Most of the studies focused on
selective permeation of products or reactants (mostly H2, in some cases O2) but the
selectivity, which is determined by Knudsen diffusion, was very modest. While
some improvement may be gained in ceramic membrane reactor when compared
to conventional reactors; it is often attributed to the dilution effect of the sweep
gas [21].
Ceramic hydrogen separation membranes that offer good selectivity to H2 and
have a potential of low-cost production may be very attractive for DH applications.
Non-metallic porous hydrogen separation membranes like carbon [22–24], silica
[25–27], and zeolitic [28, 29] are a subject of extensive investigation. These
membranes typically contain pores of molecular dimensions. As a result, steric and
energetic effects associated with the proximity of the pore wall, play an important
role in transport. Transport mechanisms through membrane pores vary with the
membrane pore size, the molecule size, and with the chemical interaction between
the transported species and the membrane material. This diffusion regime is not
well characterized and requires new computational tools like molecular dynamics.
In addition to moderate selectivity to H2, there are still many drawbacks in the
preparation technology of ceramic and carbon membranes and they often fail to
provide satisfactory durability under real operation conditions.
Carbon membranes are manufactured in a hollow ﬁber shape (Fig. 9.1) that can
be arranged in multi-ﬁber modules. They exhibit moderate selectivity to H2, e.g.,
H2-to-isobutene permeability ratio of *100 may be achieved [22]. One of the
main disadvantages of carbon membranes is their incompatibility for ODH, where
DH and oxidation are directly coupled, i.e., carried out over the same catalytic bed.
Silica membranes are typically manufactured by depositing a thin ﬁlm of silica on
a suitable support (e.g., alumina) (Fig. 9.2). Two main routes for preparation of silica
ﬁlms are chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and sol–gel [26]. To provide resistance to
water vapor, the membranes are typically doped by various metal additives (e.g. Zr
and Ni). Silica membranes exhibit moderate selectivities to hydrogen, e.g., the H2-
to-N2 selectivities are in the range of 100–500. Some membranes prepared by CVD

methods may have quite high selectivities (e.g.,[
24,000 for H2-to-CH4 and[
1,200
for H2-to-CO2), but provide low ﬂuxes [26].
Zeolites

pores (

molecular sieving and selective adsorption. Zeolite membranes have drawn
attention as suitable membranes for DH applications due to their high thermal and
chemical stability. When supported (Fig. 9.3), zeolite-based membranes also offer
excellent mechanical strength, which is an important feature for DH applications.
The permeation of single compounds in zeolitic membranes depends on the kinetic
diameter of the molecule and size selectivity and they exhibit moderate selectiv-
ities to hydrogen.

9.3 Membrane Reactor Performance
Higher alkane DH conversions are expected in a membrane reactor equipped with
a hydrogen selective membrane, when compared with a conventional packed-bed
catalytic
reactor.
This,
in
turn,
allows
operating
at
lower
temperatures,
with expected slower catalyst deactivation. Laboratory membrane reactors for
catalytic DH are commonly built as a concentric compartment packed-bed
membrane reactor (PBMR). The hydrogen separation may be carried out from the
membrane interior (the reactor shell is packed with a suitable catalyst), as well as
from the reactor shell (in this case the membrane is packed with a catalyst).
The separated hydrogen is normally swept by a sweep gas (e.g., N2) to increase the
transmembrane hydrogen pressure gradient and it may be conducted in co-current
or countercurrent mode. Hydrogen is a valuable by-product, of value in the
chemical industry and possibly for fuel cells that directly produce electricity in a
pollution-free way with the efﬁciency much higher than that of heat engines.
9.3.1 Technology Drawbacks
Several difﬁculties arise when the hydrogen selective membrane is introduced into
the reactor. The main drawbacks of this technology are related to the hydrogen
separation effectiveness, membrane durability, and hydrogen separation-induced
catalyst deactivation. The separation of hydrogen is temperature-activated but
operation at high temperatures decreases the membrane durability and results in
faster deactivation. Since DH equilibrium is favored by low pressures, the
transmembrane pressure difference should be increased by the use of a sweep gas
(e.g., N2) rather than by increasing pressure, but then, in order to recover hydrogen
from the H2–N2 mixture an additional PSA unit will be required.

mately 60-lm-thick zeolite layer is supported by an asymmetric a-Al2O3 carrier with 60 nm
pores in the upper layer of the ceramic support (after [29])

Using air for sweeping separated hydrogen is much cheaper, since air is always
available, but this approach suffers from the common to N2-sweeping back-
permeation problem and PSA is still required. It may be used, however, to provide
the heat by oxidizing the separated hydrogen, which is catalyzed by the Pd
membrane itself [30, 31]. This mode of operation is discussed in details in the
following sections. Steam, which is also easily available in industrial application,
can be used as a sweep gas, as well. In this case, the separation of hydrogen is
straightforward, simply by cooling down the mixture to condense water.
Very little work has been devoted to thermal integration of endothermic DH
with exothermic reactions (e.g., alkane oxidation). Such integration has a potential
to improve signiﬁcantly the overall efﬁciency of the process and it is discussed in
Sect. 9.4 (‘‘Future Perspectives’’). In experimental works, the heat required for DH
is typically supplied by electrical heaters, i.e., the reactor is operated under iso-
thermal conditions.
9.3.2 Membrane Reactor Performance
Many studies of membrane reactors demonstrated conversions that surpassed that
of equilibrium, at the same temperature and pressure, or that obtained in the same
reactor, when operated as packed bed (i.e. with no sweep gas).
While performance of catalytic reactors is usually plotted vs. catalyst weight (W)
to molar feed rare (F0) ratio, the performance of membrane reactor depends on that
parameter as well as on the membrane surface area. In fact in the limit of very fast
reaction the performance depends only on the equilibrium coefﬁcient and the ratio of
the feed rate to the overall hydrogen separation rate. This ratio is sometimes referred
to as a membrane Péclet number:
PeM ¼
feed rate
separation rate
ð9:5Þ
Effective H2 separation is achieved for PeM \ 1. For a given separation area,
increasing the feed rate will diminish the conversion (e.g. [15, 23, 32, 33],
Figs. 9.4, 9.5).
9.3.3 Palladium Membrane Reactors
A large number of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions were tested in the
early studies of dense-metal membrane reactors (see listing in Shu et al. [34],
Hsieh [35], and Gryaznov and Orekhova [36]). Many works tested the dehydro-
genation of cyclohexane to benzene as a model reaction since it can be carried out
at low temperature with no side reactions and no deactivation; a conversion of
99.5% was achieved with a palladium membrane, compared with 18.7% at equi-
librium, at 200C [31].
192
M. Sheintuch and D. S. A. Simakov
In early works, Pd and Pd alloys unsupported foils were used as a membrane
[15, 31, 39], with a thickness mostly in the range of *70–200 lm; thinner foils
have been found to be too fragile for the DH operation conditions. Recently, great
progress has been done in development of supported thin ﬁlm Pd–Ag membranes,
using various types of porous supports for this purpose; alumina [33] and stainless
steel [37] are mostly employed. Due to their inﬁnite selectivity to hydrogen,
Pd–Ag membranes demonstrate superior performance, increasing greatly the DH
conversions. Implementation of several DH processes in PBMRs has been studied,
such as dehydrogenation of propane [15], butane [30], isobutane [15, 33, 37–39],
and cyclohexane [31].
Sheintuch and Dessau [15] reported signiﬁcant improvement in butane and
propene yield in a PBMR equipped with Pd–Ru and Pd–Ag foils (250 and 76 lm,

respectively) packed with a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, using N2 as a sweep gas. The yields
were 76% butane at 500C, compared with 32% in equilibrium and 70% propene at
550C vs. 23% in equilibrium (Fig. 9.4); relatively stable yields were achieved for
periods of *80 h (compared with \
1 h in industrial applications). One of the
important ﬁndings was the fact that for low feed rates (low PeM), when conversions
are high and almost no H2 is present in the reactive mixture, conversion could not be
increased further by decreasing ﬂow rate or by increasing temperature due to the fast
deactivation in the absence of hydrogen. Also, high degrees of cracking and isom-
erization were found under these conditions (Fig. 9.4) due to the high residence
times. Using the kinetics described in Eqs. 9.2–9.4, and treating Ccoke as a coke-
precursor whose coverage is the pseudo-steady-state solution of formation and
destruction by reaction with hydrogen (Eq. 9.4), they were able to ﬁt the experi-
mental data and suggest optimal hydrogen pressure to be kept at the membrane.
The fabrication of a Pd–Ag alumina-supported membrane and its implemen-
tation for DH of isobutene has been reported by Guo et al. [33]. The membrane
was composed of a *9-lm-thick Pd–Ag ﬁlm deposited by electroless plating on a
150-nm-thick porous a-alumina tube. The membrane exhibited high H2 ﬂuxes
[*0.62–0.76 mol/(m2 s) at 400–500C] and isobutene conversions (over Cr2O3/
Al2O3, sweeping by Ar) much higher than those in equilibrium (Fig. 9.6, left side).
While increasing the temperature is favorable both for endothermic dehydroge-
nation and temperature-activated H2 separation, pressure has opposite effects on
the DH equilibrium and H2 separation rate and the result of this contradiction can
be seen in Fig. 9.6 (right side).
9.3.4 Deactivation
On the main concerns in DH technology is catalyst deactivation especially in the
absence of H2, as expected in membrane reactors. This may be prevented by
Fig. 9.6 Left side conversion of isobutene vs. reaction temperature at atmospheric pressure (after
[33]); right side conversion of isobutene vs. reaction pressure (after [33])

adjusting the operation parameters (e.g., the ratio of feed to sweep ﬂow rate [23])
to avoid complete separation of hydrogen, or by addition of small fractions of
hydrogen to the reactor feed. Consequently, the reactor should be designed con-
sidering the trade-off between the gain achieved by shifting the equilibrium and
negative effects induced by faster catalyst deactivation at low hydrogen concen-
trations. Slower deactivation due to addition of H2 to the reactor feed was dem-
onstrated for both conventional and membrane reactors (Fig. 9.7). Quantitative
description of these effects is required.
9.3.5 Ceramic Membrane Reactors
In spite of the drawbacks of ceramic membranes for DH processes, namely their
low separation selectivity to hydrogen, coke deposition, and their mechanical
strength which is often insufﬁcient for high temperature applications, a signiﬁcant
amount of experimental work has been reported on the subject of DH in ceramic
membrane reactors [21, 27–29, 32, 40, 41] and there are some recent reports on
ceramic membranes with high selectivity to H2 (e.g., [26]).
A carbon membrane, made up of a bundle of 20 carbon ﬁbers, was used in a
reactor for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane carried out at 195C showing a fair
improvement over equilibrium conversions [42]. A silicalite-supported zeolite
membrane was used in a reactor for the dehydrogenation of isobutane achieving
50% isobutene yield increase due to equilibrium displacement. Similar yields were
measured by sweeping the gas in co-current and countercurrent modes [28]. The
conversion and selectivity of the metathesis of propene were altered by selectively
removing trans-2-butene through a ﬂat sheet stainless steel-supported silicalite-1
membrane [43]. In isobutane dehydrogenation over a chromia alumina catalyst
conducted in a molecular-sieve carbon membrane [23] the conversion achieved in
the counter-current ﬂow operation method reached 85% at 500C, probably a
result of membrane transport and nitrogen dilution. In the vacuum mode, where no
dilution occurs, the maximal conversion obtained was 40% at 500C which is 10%

above the PFR conversion (Fig. 9.5). These results were compared with simula-
tions that used the experimentally determined transport parameters.
Weyten et al. [32] reported implementation of a SiO2 membrane prepared by
CVD for propane DH. The membrane provided quite low hydrogen ﬂuxes
[*0.01 mol/(m2 s) at 500C] and a limited H2/C3H8 permselectivity (a & 70–90
at 500C). Yet, the propane conversion was improved by a factor of *2 above the
equilibrium value (*18% at 500C). Araki et al. [26] reported fabrication of SiO2
membranes by CVD; the membranes provided similar hydrogen ﬂuxes at much
lower temperatures (*300C) and exhibited very promising selectivities (24,000
H2-to-CH4 and 1,200 H2-to-CO2). Schäfer et al. [27] prepared SiO2 membranes by
a sol–gel process and tested them for propane DH over Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/
Al2O3 catalysts. Since low separation selectivity was obtained and the membranes
suffered from coking, only minor improvement in propane conversion was
achieved.
Zeolite membranes are another extensively studied ceramic membrane
type [28, 29]. They are synthesized as a thin layer on a porous support
(e.g., Al2O3). These membranes have H2 permeation and separation selectivities
similar to those of SiO2 membranes, which again results in only minor improve-
ment in DH conversions (Fig. 9.8). Also, there are experimental evidences of
back-permeation of a sweep gas (N2 [29]).
9.3.6 Membrane Reactor Modelling
Many studies have successfully simulated the observed behavior, in various
membrane reactors and using independent kinetics and transport information; the
applied models were too speciﬁc and complex to allow a general analysis. The
models commonly assume plug ﬂow and isothermal conditions on the tube and
shell sides. Simulations included the dehydrogenation of 1-butene in a dense-

membrane reactor [44], of n-butane in a porous-membrane reactor [45], or of
isobutane in a Pd-membrane reactor ([23], Fig. 9.3), of ethane dehydrogenation in
a PBR [46] or in a perspective membrane reactor [47]. Several groups have studied
various design alternatives. Studies of radial dispersion effects in porous-
membrane reactors, using the cyclohexane dehydrogenation kinetics, concluded
that radial effects are important in high-permeability membranes [48]. The
asymptotes and design of a packed tube and shell membrane reactor for the simple
dehydrogenation reaction capitalizing on its fast reaction asymptote was analyzed
in [38]. In that case, when local equilibrium is achieved for most of the reactor, the
conversion shifts only due to hydrogen separation.
9.3.7 Thermal Management
Dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic process; therefore, heat has to be con-
tinuously supplied to drive the DH reaction. In industrial application, the heat is
supplied by the heat exchange with other units, where the heat is generated by
combustion; the heat realized during the regeneration step is also used. Experi-
mental lab-scale studies on membrane DH reactors are normally performed under
isothermal conditions, with the heat supplied by electrical heaters [e.g., 33, 37].
In theoretical studies, isothermal conditions are commonly applied [e.g., 28, 30]
and the thermal effects were paid a little attention with regard to membrane DH
reactors.
Several reports suggested oxidation of the separated hydrogen with a sweep gas
(air or oxygen) catalyzed by Pd-based membrane to provide the required heat [30,
31, 38]. Compensation of DH endothermicity by oxidizing separated H2 using air
or oxygen as a sweep gas has been experimentally demonstrated by Gobina and
Hughes [30] and Itoh and Wu [31]; Sheintuch [38] reported a model-based anal-
ysis of this approach. ODH is a proven industrial process, but there is only limited
amount of literature on implementation of this approach in membrane reactors
[39]. Though ODH allows effective heat supply, the DH selectivity is restricted.
In membrane reactors, additional drawbacks may arise, such as membrane
mechanical stability and durability.
9.4 Future Perspectives
The ﬁrst decision to be made in designing a membrane reactor for a DH reaction is
the membrane choice: the insufﬁcient selectivities obtained with porous ceramic
membranes and the high permeabilities obtained with Pd-composite membranes
suggest the latter to be the best choice for a membrane. This indeed, may be an
expensive solution, as discussed below, and the quest for other avenues should be
pursued.

The second decision concerns the design of integrating the catalyst and the
membrane. While catalytic reactor design is usually based on a rate expression
developed in the laboratory, hydrogen separation by the membrane affects the rate,
the selectivity, and the deactivation rate. Several works suggest that a minimal
hydrogen partial pressure should be maintained to avoid these shortcomings, but
there is no analytical tool to determine that value. This decision will affect other
engineering choices like the mode of hydrogen removal from the membrane (by
sweeping it or by collecting it undiluted at 1 bar or under vacuum) and the ﬂow
direction in the bed and in the membrane (co- or counter-current). Kinetic work
aimed at deriving rate expressions at low hydrogen pressures should be conducted.
The emergence of new computational catalysis tools may be helpful in that
direction.
The third choice to be made is the mode of heat supply to sustain the endo-
thermal DH reaction. ODH is one choice that at present yields unsatisfactory
yields and selectivities. Other approaches are coupling the catalytic bed with
another, in which an exothermic reaction is conducted. The authors have dem-
onstrated such a solution, for hydrogen production in methane steam reforming, in
a reactor composed of three concentric tubes (for methane combustion, for
methane steam reforming, and for the Pd membrane) [49, 50]. Another approach is
partial combustion of hydrogen on the membrane side. Very little work has been
conducted on thermal solutions of membrane reactors.
Since the feasibility and durability of the hydrogen separation membranes and
the feasibility of membrane reactor has been already demonstrated, the main
obstacle for implementation is the cost added by the membrane. The cost
contribution to the membrane can be gauged as follows: as stated previously
(Sect.
9.3.2),

to limit the rate. Taking PeM = 0.5 and using the best membrane permeabilities
we can translate it to membrane surface area. The required catalyst amount is:
Wc ¼ FA0=rA0;
in order of magnitude, where rA0 is the initial rate. Thus, the ratio of membrane
area to catalyst weight required is:

The commercial cost of Pd–Ag-supported membranes (mass production) is
projected to be *1500 $/m2, and the catalyst cost for dehydrogenation applica-
tions is \
100 $/kg. The Pd–Ag membranes may provide ﬂuxes (JH2) as high as
0.5–2.5 mol/(m2 s) [16–18] and the DH reaction rates are in the range of *0.1–
1 mol/(kg s). This estimation suggests that the membrane cost (when using mass
production) will be comparable with the catalyst cost.

Steam Reforming of Natural Gas
in a Reformer and Membrane Modules
Test Plant: Plant Design Criteria
and Operating Experience

10.1 Introduction
The natural gas steam reforming process is controlled by chemical equilibrium and
signiﬁcant hydrogen yields are achieved only at high temperatures (850–900C).
A part of methane feedstock has to be burned in furnaces, reducing the process
global efﬁciency, increasing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and strength-
ening the dependence of hydrogen cost on the natural gas cost.
Technology development in the past years has been focussed on reducing the
reforming temperatures, in order to increase process efﬁciency and reduce oper-
ating costs. The integration of hydrogen selective membranes appears to be a
promising way to enhance hydrogen yield at lower temperatures, because the
selective removal of hydrogen produced in reaction zone prevents the equilibrium
conversion to be achieved. Therefore, the continuous removal of the hydrogen
from reaction environment should allow the reaction to be supported at lower
temperature.
Among the typologies of hydrogen selective membranes, thin Pd-based sup-
ported membranes seem to be the most promising thanks to the high selectivity
and high permeation ﬂow [1–6]. They can be integrated in steam reforming pro-
cess by means of two potential conﬁgurations:

1. Hydrogen selective membrane is assembled in separation modules applied
downstream toreaction units.The process scheme, called reformer and membrane
module (RMM), is composed by a series of reaction–separation modules [7, 8].
2. Selective membrane is assembled directly inside the reaction environment, so
that the hydrogen produced by reactions is immediately removed. Such a
conﬁguration is called Membrane Reactor (MR) [9–13].
In a previous work, the authors have compared beneﬁts and drawbacks of these
conﬁgurations [14]. The main outcomes were:
• Pd-based membrane has to operate at temperature below 500C for stability
problem. This leads to limit reaction operating temperature in MR, while in
RMM conﬁguration operating temperatures in reactor and in separator are de-
coupled and can be ﬁxed separately
• Globally, the hydrogen production costs for the RMM technology are more than
10% lower than those of the conventional H2 scheme coupled with the cogen-
eration unit, where electrical power is produced by process outlet mixture.
Starting from these considerations, an innovative 20 Nm3/h prototypal RMM
plant has been designed and realized. The plant is composed by two-step
reformers, working at 550–650C, and two membrane modules at 450C.
10.2 Process Scheme Description
The process scheme is illustrated in Fig. 10.1 and consists of two-step RMM.
Natural gas from battery limits or from cylinders at 20 barg is introduced
through the pressure regulator and ﬂow controller to the feed desulfurisation (DS)
reactor, where sulfur compounds are removed. The desulfurised feed is then mixed
with steam in ratio ranging from 3 to 4. Mixed feed is preheated in the convection
section and enters the ﬁrst reforming stage which works at a temperature of 550C
or higher. The reformed gas product is cooled down at 450C and enters the ﬁrst
separation module. A retentate, recycled to the second reformer stage and a
mixture of H2 plus sweeping steam, are produced. The stream ﬂowing out of the
second reformer stage is cooled down from 650 to 450C and routed to the second
separation module. H2 from both modules are mixed together and sent to ﬁnal
cooling and condensate separation. Retentate from the second stage is sent to the
ﬂare. The pressure of both shell and permeate sides are controlled using a back
pressure regulators. Both membrane modules are protected using a pressure relief
regulator installed on the income lines.
All the vent points are connected to main vent system and routed to the ﬂare.
The reaction of heat in both reforming steps is provided by two independent hot
gas generators in order to set the reforming temperatures as required by the tests.
Figure 10.2 shows a bird-eye view of the industrial test plant completely
erected which occupies an area of 1,000 m2.

10.3 Reactors and Separators Design
10.3.1 Two-Steps Reformer Design
Each module of the reformer consists essentially of two main sections: the radiant
box, containing the tube charged with the structured catalyst, and the convection
section, where heat is recovered from the ﬂue gases for preheating and super-
heating the feed and the steam. The steam is produced separately by a hot oil
boiler. The steam reforming reactions are carried out at pressure up to 20 barg and
temperatures in the range of 550–650C, while the ﬂue gases coming from the hot
generator may reach a temperature[
800C. Design of the radiant chamber is quite
conventional, it differs only by the heated length of the reformer tube which is
around 3 m, the tube metallurgy and the contained catalyst. One of the advantages
of the proposed architecture is to require low cost stainless steel instead of exotic
and quite expensive material as HP25/35 chromium/nickel alloy.
Traditionally, in the steam reforming of natural gas there is a strong endo-
thermic reaction region located at the inlet of the catalytic tubes. At such a section,
the rate limiting process is the heat transfer from the combustion gases through the
heated reactor wall and catalyst bed.
The lower reforming temperature rises the issue of how much CH4 conversion
is close to the equilibrium value. Preliminary experimental results [15] caused

some doubts about the effectiveness of industrial nickel based catalyst supported
on ceramic materials as a-Al2O3, MgO and Mg–Al2O4. In order to enhance the
conductive heat transfer and the catalyst activity, a noble metal catalyst supported
on SiC foam (see Fig. 10.3) has been investigated. The open cross ﬂow SiC foam
is expected to increase the effectiveness of convective heat transfer allowing the
tube metal temperature (Tmt) to be reduced with the same heat ﬂux or conversely
allowing the heat ﬂux to be increased with the same Tmt.

The use of a foam as catalytic support results also in lower pressure drops in the
catalytic bed which in turn reduce the energy costs associated with the gas com-
pression and with the recirculation of gas streams as in the proposed architecture.
10.3.2 Dense Pd-based Membranes for Hydrogen Separation
In this section, a description of the four different membrane separators installed in
the plant is given. Such units enable hydrogen separation at high temperature.
During the last decade a signiﬁcant effort was devoted to thin or low thickness
(
\
10 lm) Pd-based membranes supported on different porous substrates and to
move the technology from lab scale to larger surface dimensions. Among the few
membranes provider/developers, three of them, ECN from The Netherland [16], a
company from Japan and MRT from Canada [17] were selected and included in
the project. A fourth company, Acktar from Israel [18] was also involved, but its
membrane will be tested later. All these membranes are Pd based, but with dif-
ferent supports. ECN membranes and those ones from Japanese manufacturer are
made by a ceramic support whereas Acktar and MRT membranes have a stainless
steel substrate. With the exception of ECN, all membranes are Pd/Ag alloy
membranes. The membranes have a tubular geometry, with the exception of MRT
which is planar.
Table 10.1 reports the main properties and geometry of membranes included in
the project. Figure 10.4a–d shows the different modules.
10.4 Control System and Testing Strategies
The main features of the instruments of the control system are reported here. Flow
controllers are used for natural gas, steam, sweeping steam to the membrane
separator and hydrogen produced. Temperatures and pressures are measured and

recorded before and after each reformer and separation step. A differential pressure
sensor monitors the pressure drop across the catalytic tube. CH4, CO, and CO2
concentrations are monitored by online infra-red NDIR multiple analyzer, ABB
URAS 14, at the outlet of the two reforming steps and of the membrane modules
outlets. H2 is analyzed by a thermal conductivity detector ABB Caldos 17 and
through a Perkin Elmer GC Autosystem XL. By acting on the reformer outlet
temperature and on the steam/carbon ratio it is possible to generate different
syngas compositions to be fed to the separation module and to analyze the role
played by partial pressures of the main components (CH4, CO, CO2, and H2) in the
separation performance (see Fig. 10.5).
An overview of the syngas composition range used as feed in membrane testing
is reported in Table 10.2; such compositions resulted from the natural gas con-
version obtained in the two reforming steps. Alternatively feed gas composition
could also be obtained by mixing up the pure components directly from the
cylinders.

It is also possible to modify the inlet temperature to the separation modules in the
range 400–500C by acting on the cooling media ﬂow of the pre-heater installed just
before the module. On the permeate side, steam is added as sweeping media to lower
the partial pressure of hydrogen and to increase the driving force for separation.
Heating and cooling of the membrane are carried out under nitrogen atmo-
sphere, as suggested by the producers. In order to reduce the ﬂushing time with

week-end), they are kept warm by a mixture a nitrogen and steam at 400C.
10.5 Process Conditions for Plant Testing
A wide variety of operating conditions is adopted in the tests performed to assess
the proper operability in an industrial environment and to have a clear evidence of
the potential of RMM technology in terms of efﬁciency. Figure 10.6a and b report
gas composition monitored on-line; in particular Fig. 10.6a shows instantaneous
measurements of the methane at the outlet of the ﬁrst reforming step. Figure 10.6b
represents the hourly average for the main components at a pressure of 10 barg and
a temperature of 600C at the outlet of the ﬁrst reforming step.

10.5.1 Low Temperature Steam Reforming Testing
In order to obtain a full set of data, several tests were carried out by varying the
reformer outlet temperature from 550 to 650C and pressure from 10 to 20 barg.
The experimental points in Fig. 10.7 represent methane and hydrogen contents in
the syngas during a steady state operation at 550C, S/C of 4.8 and 10 barg during
720 h on stream. Although the on-stream time is limited no sign of deactivation
has been yet detected.
Methane conversion versus the gaseous inlet hourly space velocity is shown in
Fig. 10.8. Conversion efﬁciency is deﬁnitely affected by the space velocity (s.v.).
Converted methane increases with s.v. as result of a better conductive heat and
mass transfer up to a peak at around 5,000 h-1. Higher s.v. reduce the methane
conversion from 49.5 to 46.5%.

It is well-known that hydrogen ﬂux through the membrane usually increases
with the temperature, since membrane permeability depends on operating tem-
perature according to Arrhenius’ law (refer to Chap. 2):

Values of parameters A and Eafor the membranes assembled can be found by
plant testing through the following procedure:
1. At a ﬁxed pressure difference between shell and lumen (10 barg in retentate,
0.4 barg in permeate zone), the hydrogen ﬂux is measured for different oper-
ating temperatures.
2. Assuming the Arrhenius permeability dependence on the temperature and
Sieverts’ law, the hydrogen ﬂux can be described by the following expression:

Figure 10.10 shows the variation of the hydrogen ﬂux versus the operation
temperature of the membrane module. By raising the temperature from 400 to
440C the hydrogen content in the retentate is reduced from 57% to \ 54% vol.
10.5.3 Feed and Sweep Flows on Membrane Testing
Feed ﬂow impact on membrane performance is analyzed in the range 25–110% of
the design ﬂow. It is expected that an increase of feed ﬂow will reduce the feed
conversion. In Fig. 10.11 methane conversions with and without membrane are
compared versus the space velocity after 70 h of operation with ECN membrane
without steam sweeping. It appears quite clearly that by increasing the space
velocity conversion of methane decreases.
10.6 Plant Global Performance
Global performance of the new architecture is presented in Fig. 10.12 in terms of
methane conversion.
By comparing the methane content at the outlet of the ﬁrst reaction step, R-01,
with the content at R-02, is possible to quantify the methane conversion increase
from 47.3% at R-01 outlet to 60% at R-02 outlet: a 25% increase at the same outlet
temperature and S/C.
Effect of membrane on the methane concentration in the retentate gas can be
analyzed looking at the difference between the outlet of R-01, 19% average, and
23% at the outlet of ﬁrst separation module.
Such effect appears to be less important (from 14 to 15.5%) in the second
separation module, mainly due to the fact that the second module surface was 1/5
of the ﬁrst.

10.7 Comparison of RMM and Integrated Membrane Reactor
Conﬁgurations
As reported before, hydrogen selective membranes can be integrated in steam
reforming process by means of two potential conﬁgurations:
• assembled in separation modules applied downstream to reaction units (RMM);
• directly inside the reaction environment (MR).
After the testing phase on RMM prototypal plant reported in this chapter, a
comparison between the two conﬁgurations can be made in order to assess beneﬁts
and drawbacks in integrating selective membrane internally or externally.
The RMM beneﬁts over MR can be thus summarized:
1. The possibility to decouple reaction and separation operating conditions. The
reforming and separation module temperatures can be optimized independently,
both increasing methane conversion for each reaction step and membrane
stability and lifetime.
2. Simpliﬁcation of the mechanical design of membrane tubes compared to those
embedded in catalyst tubes. A simple ‘‘shell and tube’’ geometry can be
selected for the tubular separation module.
3. Simpliﬁcation of membrane modules maintenance and of catalyst replacement.
On the other hand, the main drawbacks are:
1. No compactness of the process, since RMM conﬁguration is composed by
reactors, separation modules, heat exchangers while, in MR, reaction and H2
separation are performed in one single and compact device.
2. A higher membrane surface required.
At the same time, the main beneﬁts of MR over RMM conﬁguration are:
1. Compactness of the process. The integration in a single device of steam reforming
reaction and hydrogen separation step leads to a more compact reforming plant.
2. Easiness in scalability. Scale-up and scale-down of the membrane reformer are
very easy through an increase or a decrease of a number of parallel tubular
reactors or of the length of the single membrane reformer.
3. Less application of useless catalyst. In the traditional process, due to strong
radial temperature gradient, the catalyst pellets placed in the central zone of
reformers usually do not work well since the temperature is too low for pro-
moting the reactions. In membrane reformers, the central zone of the reactor
does not contain catalyst but it is taken by the membrane tube devoted to collect
the hydrogen permeated.
Main drawbacks of MR conﬁguration are:
1. Technological problems in designing the reactor. A sensible component as the
selective membrane has to be inserted in a critical environment.
214
M. De Falco et al.
2. The coupling between reaction and separation operating conditions, leading to
the necessity to ﬁnd a compromise between the reaction and the separation
requirements.
3. No easy maintenance of the reactor.
At the current selective membranes state-of-the-art, the advantage of separately
ﬁxing reactors and separators operating conditions seems to be crucial, considering
the sensitivity of supported Pd-based membranes to temperature. Therefore, RMM
plant can be considered the most reliable solution.
A further improvement of membrane technology, foreseeable in the next years,
should change this perspective, promoting the integration of membranes directly
inside the reactors.
10.8 Conclusions
The primary objective of this project was to provide clear evidence of potential-
ities of the selective membrane technology in major chemical, petrochemical and
other process applications to provide substantial reductions in energy consumption
and in investment costs. It was recognized that the construction of a semi-indus-
trial test plant is required to assess the operability in an industrial environment.
Therefore a 20 Nm3/h hydrogen membrane steam reforming plant has been
designed and fabricated and a complete control system has been integrated in order
to monitor reactors and membranes performance varying operating conditions
(temperatures, pressures, ﬂow-rates, and sweeping ﬂow).
In this chapter the design criteria implemented have been presented, together
with the operating conditions ranges analyzed. A catalytic foam has been inserted
in the reformers in order to increase the effectiveness of the heat transfer and to
reduce pressure drop, and four types of Pd-based hydrogen selective membranes
are tested and compared.
Preliminarily experimental results have been presented, conﬁrming the interest
in such a new architecture.

11.1 Current Technology Status
Selective membrane application in chemical processes represents one of the most
interesting scientiﬁc and technological topics over the last years, in the context of
industrial process intensiﬁcation tendency aimed to improve process efﬁciency.
Many efforts devoted to the development of membrane competitive applica-
tions by the most prestigious research centers worldwide attest the strategic
importance and the potentiality of membrane reactors for the industry. The sci-
entiﬁc production dealing with selective membrane reactors is growing expo-
nentially: as reported in Chap. 2, 750 papers on membrane reactors have been
published in 2009, of which 220 on Pd-based membranes. The main processes in
which R&D departments are focusing the attention are those devoted to hydrogen
production, for which two conﬁgurations are under study:
1. Integrated membrane reactor conﬁguration. Selective membrane is assembled
directly inside the reaction environment, so that the hydrogen produced by
reactions is immediately removed.
2. Staged membrane reactor conﬁguration. Selective membrane is assembled in
separation modules applied downstream to reaction units, and the plant is
composed by a series of reaction-separation modules.

All these efforts and resources are producing results so that more and more
effective and suitable selective membranes are made and applied, even if some
problems have to be still overcome before a wide industrial use.
Almost all fulﬁllments developed up today concern experimental apparatuses
with very small productivities, and no scale-up strategies are conceived yet,
mainly because only few companies are able to supply high-surface Pd-based
membrane modules.
In Chap. 3, a review of the few manufacturers able to produce selective
Pd-based membranes with surfaces suitable for pilot plants (0.1–0.5 m2) has been
reported. Five providers have been found:
1. The Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) that produces mem-
branes of Pd on alumina support with a surface area equal to 0.4 m2 and
selective layer thickness of 3–9 lm.
2. MRT, a Vancouver-based private company, produces membranes either as
rolled foils or as deposited thin ﬁlms (8–15 lm). Maximum surface is 0.6 m2.
3. An important Japanese Company (JC) is developing a gas separation membrane
of Pd on Al2O3 support. The surface of selective layer is 28.3 cm2.
4. SINTEF, research and educational centre in the ﬁeld of environmental tech-
nology, has developed a very thin Pd-alloy selective layer (approximately
2–3 lm) supported on macroporous substrates, able to operate at high pressure.
5. The Israel company ACKTAR is developing a 3–5 lm thin Pd or Pd–Ag
membrane on steel substrate (refer to Chap. 10).
However, laboratory scale reactor performance and assessments by mathe-
matical models simulations have shown the real and excellent potentiality of
membrane integration in chemical processes, leading to a strong increase of
reactant conversion at lower operating temperatures. Table 11.1 summarizes the
main outcomes reported in Chaps. 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), where some interesting case
studies have been presented and described.
Obviously, membrane reactor performance is strongly dependent on selective
membrane behavior in terms of permeability, selectivity, and stability. Chapter 2
reports several data about hydrogen permeation performance of different metal-
based and particularly of Pd-based membranes.

Recently, the ﬁrst membrane reactor pilot plant has been realized. A staged
membrane reactor for natural gas steam reforming, also called reformer and
membrane modules (RMM) test plant, having the capacity of 20 Nm3/h of
hydrogen, has been designed and constructed to investigate at an industrial scale
level the performance of such innovative architecture.
The process operates at low thermal level (below 650C in comparison to 850–
950C needed in tradition plants), whereas membrane modules work at 450C, a
safe temperature for Pd-based membrane stability. Data concerning plant behavior
after 720 h are extensively reported in Chap. 10: it has been demonstrated that a
ﬁnal methane conversion after a two-step reaction equal to 60% can be obtained,
equivalent to an improvement of 20% over the equilibrium threshold (conversion
equal to about 50% at 650C, 10 barg and a ratio between steam and methane
feedstocks of 4.8), moreover recovering a highly pure hydrogen stream.
11.2 Barriers to Be Overcome
Although all these efforts have produced very promising results, some techno-
logical challenges still need to be addressed before hydrogen selective membranes,
and particularly Pd-based membranes, will become enough reliable and cost-
competitive for industrial applications. Of course, an interdisciplinary approach,
with a stringent collaboration between industry and university, and among various
scientiﬁc and technological sectors such as chemistry, physics, and engineering, is
crucial to make the commercialization of hydrogen selective membranes and of
membrane reactors a reality.
In the following sections, the main barriers to be overcome are listed and
commented.
11.2.1 Fabrication Methods
The development of manufacture methods for producing thin selective layer
membranes with high selectivity, high permeability, and high stability is the
crucial task to be reached.
Main production methods are described in Chaps. 2 and 3, but no one is still
completely developed in terms of costs and reliability and able to produce high
surface (some square meters) membranes.
Concerning hydrogen selective membranes, industry is mainly focused on the
manufacture of composite membranes made of a thin Pd ﬁlm on porous substrates.
Reducing the selective layer thickness allows membrane cost to be decreased
(decreasing the Pd thickness by a factor two reduces the total Pd cost by a factor
four) and increasing the hydrogen ﬂux, which is in inverse proportion with the ﬁlm
thickness. On the other side, the porous substrates provides the mechanical
11
Future Perspectives
219
strength needed for the application in chemical processes and for tolerating the
down-up pressure difference, which is the hydrogen permeation mechanism
driving force.
Two main challenges have to be tackled:
1. The selection of porous substrate. Ceramic supports are chemically stable, have
small pore sizes and a more uniform pore size distribution, essential for the
formation of thinner and uniform membrane layer. But they are brittle, and the
large difference in thermal expansion coefﬁcients between palladium layer and
ceramic supports leads to membrane cracking and loss of adherence. On the
other hand, metallic porous supports made of stainless steel (PSS) have a more
similar thermal expansion coefﬁcient, reducing thermal stresses, but the large
pore size and wide pore size distribution make the formation of a uniform
selective layer problematic.
2. Selective layer deposition methods. Depositing the Pd-based layer on selected
substrates is not an easy task. Finding and applying reliable and cost-competitive
deposition methods is the main challenge that scientists and technicians have to
still overcome. Deposition method has to assure a proper membrane stability
within the operative range in which the membrane has to work.
11.2.2 Membrane Surface Poisoning and Membrane Durability
Another critical problem is represented by the palladium surface contamination of
Hg vapor, hydrogen sulﬁde, SO2, thiophene, arsenic, unsaturated hydrocarbons,
chlorine, and carbon from organic materials (refer to Chap. 2).
The lack of long-term durability data creates an uncertainty about membrane
reliability for industrial application. Most long-term stability studies reported in the
literature are in the order of hundreds of hours, whereas for an industrial applica-
tion, long-term stability tests have to be carried out in thousands of hours [1].
Taking as a reference the targets imposed by the US DOE, the stability/dura-
bility target for 2007 is 3 years, 2010 target is 7 years, and 2015 target is
[
10 years [2]. This means that a long road has to be still covered.
11.2.3 Membrane Integration in Reaction Environment
Integrating the selective membrane in a critical environment as chemical reaction
one (high temperature and pressure, presence of membrane contaminants), i.e.,
imposing the integrated membrane reactor conﬁguration, is a challenging issue.
Nowadays, only laboratory scale prototypes have been constructed, and even if
promising performance has been obtained, the reactor scale-up problems have still
not be properly faced.
220
M. De Falco et al.
Overcoming these barriers should lead to make Pd-based hydrogen selective
membrane an industrial product in a few years.
11.3 Technological Perspectives
This section provides some reﬂections and focus on future work and data required
to advance the membrane technology toward commercial application. Best solu-
tions to overcome barriers listed in the previous paragraph (membrane architecture
and manufacturing, interaction between the membranes and major components of
the syn-gas, long-term durability) are here proposed.
11.3.1 Membrane Architecture and Manufacturing
High permeation ﬂux is the key determinant for future commercial application. As
aforementioned, thin, few lm thickness, Pd or Pd alloy–based ﬁlms supported on
porous substrates are the right answer, providing the needed mechanical strength
for process application, decreasing the cost and sometimes increasing the hydrogen
ﬂux.
Porous metallic support made, for instance, of sintered stainless steel (PSS),
may represent a valid alternative to minimize the stress generated by the difference
of thermal expansion coefﬁcient between the membrane and the support, but the
use of metallic support may cause signiﬁcant inter-diffusion problems, which can
be solved only by the application of an inter-diffusion barrier.
Actually, several types of barrier materials have been tested: TiN, TiO2, Al2O3,
a-Fe2O3, and YSZ; TiN was considered the most promising one, and sputtering
seems to be the best application technique.
The composite Pd on PSS membranes prepared with an oxide barrier has been
shown to be stable up to a temperature of 450C for over 6,000 h [1].
Hydrogen permeance of 100 Nm3/m2 h bar0.5 at 500C can be achievable
today; during tests on the industrial pilot plant (refer to Chap. 10), values up to 24
Nm3/m2 h bar0.5 have been measured at 436C; this value should double by
operating at 500C.
As far as the method of formation of thin Pd layers, electroless plating has given
excellent results without showing any problem of hydrogen embrittlement (see
ECN module experimental data); PVD sputtering represents a valid alternative for
Pd alloy ﬁlm, in order to overcome the difﬁculty to control the ﬁlm alloy
composition.
Furthermore, in general, the idea to manufacture the membrane components
(ﬁlm and the support) separately and then assembly together will allow to have a
better quality control of the products, reducing the fabrication costs and making
easier the assembling.
11
Future Perspectives
221
11.3.2 Interaction of Syn-gas Components with Pd and Pd Alloy
Absorption of CO, CO2, and CH4 on Pd surface has been reported in literature as a
potential problem in reducing permeability or even for the complete deterioration
of the entire membrane. The idea beyond is that such components may be absorbed
on active surface sites blocking the hydrogen permeation.
The results reported by Ma et al. [1] on the effect of CO and CO2 on composite
Pd membrane was negligible in a hydrogen-rich environment of steam reforming
of natural gas at 500C; also, the authors’ experience [3] under real operating
conditions at a maximum temperature of 450C did not evidence changes in
permeability with a Pd membrane treating a syn-gas from a steam reforming step.
Sulfur poisoning is not a real issue because organic sulfur in the feed is nor-
mally converted and removed through a hydro-treating and ZnO adsorption prior
of the reforming step.
11.3.3 Long-term Stability
In order to be viable for commercial applications at industrial level, membranes
have to be tested for long periods to verify long-term stability over thousands of
hours. Iaquaniello et al. [4] presented a competitive architecture for producing
hydrogen based on membrane life assumption of at least 24,000 h of continuous
operation.
Alternatively, the development of accelerated procedures for durability testing
may shorten the required testing phase, as was proven by Bredesen et al. [5].
Data reported by Matzakos [6] showed a composite Pd/PSS membrane stable
for approximately 6,000 h at 500C under actual steam reforming conditions.
Experimental data [4] with the ECN membranes over a period of more than 500 h,
and not less than 50 cycles of heating and cooling, have not shown any evidences
of instability problems. The rate of temperature changes used during the tests was
of the order of 3–4C per minute, in order to bring the module in operation within
2–3 h.
Although operating data have not yet conﬁrmed a minimum life of 3 years
under industrial operating conditions, it becomes quite evident that such a target is
not so far away to be achieved. As far as the hydrogen purity is concerned, data
collected at the pilot unit and presented in Chap. 10 show a hydrogen purity greater
than 99.95% over 500 h of operation, with CO content in the range of 20–50 ppm.
As we said before, potential of membrane reactors is enormous, and in par-
ticular, they could play a key role with endothermic reactions because the higher
reactant conversion at lower temperature allows less energetic and more efﬁcient
processes to be developed. As an example, natural gas steam-reforming is a rather
expensive process, energy and capital expensive due to the endothermicity of the
reaction.
222
M. De Falco et al.
A lower reaction temperature will make possible, for instance, to apply the
concept of topping cycle cogeneration, where power is generated introducing a
heat engine between the ﬂames and the process ﬂuid. Iaquaniello et al. [7] reported
a speciﬁc application for the integration of a gas turbine with a ﬁred heater.
A new conﬁguration will then emerge with membrane reactors where heat and
power are cogenerated, substantial energy savings and CO2 emissions are
achieved, and manufacturing costs are reduced.
Under a more general frame, the elimination of fuel combustion in ﬁred heaters
allows the use of multiple sources of low temperature heat as solar-heated molten
salts or helium from a nuclear power [8] and not only the gas turbine exhausts. The
cogenerative scheme presented for steam reforming could easily be extended to
the other chemical processes that have been analyzed in this book.
11.4 Economical Perspectives
The major cost for a composite Pd-based membrane is not the Pd material being
now feasible to produce ﬁlms in the range of few lm. With such a thinner ﬁlm,
cost of Pd becomes less of factor. The cost of 3-lm thickness Pd layer plus cost for
ceramic support tube was indicated at 900 €/m2 by van Delft et al. [9]. Cost of the
entire manufacturing process is the real determinant of the overall fabrication cost.
A reasonable price within 1,500–2,000 €/m2 of thin Pd alloy membranes could
be reached at the end of next decade only if a high cumulative volume of pro-
duction is reached. Of course, such a cost has to be associated with a hydrogen
permeance of at least 100 Nm3/m2 h bar0.5 at 500C.
A couple of preconditions also need to be fulﬁlled: ﬁrst of all, long-term sta-
bility/durability has to be demonstrated without any doubt; secondly, one or two
defect-free technologies need to emerge to sustain cost reduction based on eco-
nomics of scale. In Chap. 3, Physical Vapor Deposition technology was indicated
together with a roll-in process for producing the Pd-based thin ﬁlm, a very
promising technology for industrial mass production. Separation of Pd-based thin
ﬁlm preparation from the manufacturing of the support and from the ﬁnal
assembling may also emerge as the winning Membranes Manufacturing Strategy
(MMS) in order to bring such a technology to the market.
11.5 Conclusions
The major features and application opportunities for integrated membrane reactor
and staged membrane reactor conﬁguration have been described in some details.
We may conclude that membrane reactors actually show promises for conversion
of equilibrium-limited reactions, selectivity toward some intermediates and
improvement of energy efﬁciency. Consistent application of such technology
11
Future Perspectives
223
requires long-term stability of the membrane, defect-free fabrication, a hydrogen
permeance of at least 100 Nm3/m2 h bar0.5 and a MMS able to gain from economy
of scale when high cumulative volume of production can be achieved. It is also
important to promote tests and results outside lab scale. What presented in
Chap. 10 is only a ﬁrst step toward industrial scale analysis and much more is
required in terms of data reproducibility and technology acceptability. Although
the primary role in developing such membranes and membrane modules belongs to
material engineers, chemical engineers will play an important role in developing a
better knowledge in modeling such complex unconventional reactors, on more
heat- and energy-efﬁcient schemes and on looking at new applications.
When such knowledge will achieve commercialization? Opinions are quite
different in spite of the large number of patents and papers recently published on
such a subject as we have seen in Chap. 2.
It is quite clear that any new invention takes time, in particular, in a very mature
business such as the oil, gas, and petrochemicals. However, we are pretty conﬁdent
that in the next 10–15 years such a technology will deﬁnitively emerge.
