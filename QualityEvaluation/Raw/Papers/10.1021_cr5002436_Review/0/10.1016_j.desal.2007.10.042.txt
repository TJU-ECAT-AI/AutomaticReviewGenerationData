Abstract
In this paper a general review on different membrane processes and membrane reactors was done. As the main
aim of this paper is to review the application of membrane processes in petrochemical industry, processes such as
olefin/paraffin separation, light solvent separation, solvent dewaxing, phenol and aromatic recovery, dehydrogenation,
oxidative coupling of methane and steam reforming of methane were discussed in detail. Besides, separation using
polymer-inorganic nano composite membranes and wastewater treatment using membrane bio-reactors were
reviewed.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, membrane technologies are be-
coming more frequently used for separation of
wide varying mixtures in the petrochemical-re-
lated industries and can compete successfully with
traditional schemes [1–5]:
•
The technology behind membrane gas separa-
tion is potentially an energy-saving one, be-
cause the separation process takes place with-
out phase transition.
•
It is also better for the environment, since the
membrane approach requires the use of rela-
tively simple and non-harmful materials.

•
The recovery of minor but valuable compo-
nents from a main stream using membranes
can be done without substantial additional en-
ergy costs.
•
Compared with conventional techniques,
membranes can offer a simple, easy-to-oper-
ate, low-maintenance process option.
•
The development of novel materials for gas
membrane manufacturing such as organic
polymeric, hybrid organic-inorganic and inor-
ganic will expand the use of membrane tech-
nology into new fields of applications in the
petrochemical industry.
•
The process is simple.
•
There are diverse applications which can be
studied by the same basic formulations.
•
The process is generally carried out at atmo-
spheric conditions which, besides being energy
efficient, can be important for sensitive appli-
cations encountered in pharmaceutical and
food industry.
•
Modules can be added and optimized in a pro-
cess design to achieve the desired separation.
•
Their systems have a low capital cost, com-
pact size, modular configuration, and low spe-
cific power consumption, which reduce the
production cost.
•
It is a clean process and requires simple and
inexpensive filtration.
•
The process is continuous and the membranes
do not require regeneration, unlike the adsorp-
tion or the absorption processes, which require
a regeneration step leading to the use of two
solid beds or a solvent regeneration unit.
In the petrochemical industry, olefins such as
ethylene and propylene are the most important
chemicals used for the production of polyolefins
such as polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene,
ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile,
and isopropanol. An important step in the manu-
facture of olefins is large-scale separation of the
olefin from the corresponding paraffin [6]. Fur-
thermore, dehydrogenation, oxidative coupling of
methane, steam reforming of methane and water
gas shift reaction are some important reactions in
petrochemical industry.
Membrane gas separation is attractive because
of its simplicity and low energy cost, but it has
one major drawback and that is a reverse rela-
tionship between selectivity and permeability.
Nano composite membranes, in which selectivity
and permeability can simultaneously be improved,
solve this problem.
Petrochemical waste streams may contain phe-
nolic compounds or aromatic amines. They are
highly toxic and at high concentrations are inhibi-
tory to biological treatment. Membrane aromatic
recovery system (MARS) is a relatively new pro-
cess for recovery of aromatic acids and bases.
Wastewater in petrochemical industry is cur-
rently treated by activated sludge process with
pretreatment of oil/water separation. Tightening
effluent regulations and increasing need for reuse
of treated water have generated interest in the
treatment of petrochemical wastewater with the
advanced membrane bio-reactor (MBR) process.
In this paper, membrane and their application
in some important petrochemical processes, nano
composite membranes and membrane bioreactors
are reviewed.
2. What is a membrane?
Membrane is defined essentially as a barrier,
which separates two phases and restricts trans-
port of various chemicals in a selective manner. A
membrane can be homogenous or heterogeneous,
symmetric or asymmetric in structure, solid or liq-
uid; can carry a positive or negative charge or be
neutral or bipolar. Transport through a membrane
can be affected by convection or by diffusion of
individual molecules, induced by an electric field
or concentration, pressure or temperature gradi-
ent. The membrane thickness may vary from as
small as 10 microns to few hundred micrometers.
The principal types of membrane are shown sche-

3. Membrane processes
Transport through the membrane takes place
when a driving force is applied to the components
in the feed. In most of the membrane processes,
the driving force is a pressure difference or a con-
centration (or activity) difference across the mem-
brane. Parameters such as pressure, concentration
(or activity) and even temperature may be included
in one parameter, the chemical potential μ.
Another driving force in membrane separations
is the electrical potential difference. This driving
force only influences the transport of charged
particles or molecules. The membrane processes,
according to their driving forces, are classified in
Table 1 [11]; the status of developed, developing
and yet-to-be developed industrial membrane
technologies is summarized in Table 2 [7] and a
detail explanation of different membrane pro-
cesses is represented in Table 3.
3.1. Gas separation by membranes
The separation of mixtures of gases is per-
formed with the objective of obtaining one or more
of the constituents in a pure form. There are many
applications in both large scale and small scale
processes. Separation can be achieved by several
methods based on different physical and chemi-
cal properties of the species.

M. Takht Ravanchi et al. / Desalination 235 (2009) 199–244
There are four important methods applied to
the separation of gases: absorption, adsorption,
cryogenics and membranes (Table 4). Process eco-
nomics will determine which of these methods is
used for any particular applications [8,22–28].
Membrane separation based on “selective” gas
permeation competes directly with other three
mentioned methods in many applications. Mem-
branes offer versatility and simplicity in compari-
son to other methods, which must be balanced
against limitations of medium purity and the need
for recompression [22]. All the membrane sepa-
ration processes have the common feature that
separation is achieved via a membrane.
This process competes with technology alter-
natives such as adsorption, cryogenic distillation,
etc in niche application areas. The membrane pro-
cess has certain advantageous, i.e. compactness
and light in weight, low labor intensity, modular
design permitting easy expansion or operation at

Membranes made of polymers and copolymers
in the forms of flat film or hollow fibers have been
used for gas separation. It is possible even with
the two extreme types of membrane considered,
i.e. porous and nonporous. The transport mecha-
nisms through these two types of membrane are
completely different. In porous membranes when
gas transport takes place by viscous flow, no sepa-
ration is achieved because the mean free path of
the gas molecules is very small relative to the pore
diameter. By decreasing the pore diameter of the
pores in the membrane, the mean free path of the
gas molecules may become greater than the pore
diameter. This kind of gas flow is called Knudsen
flow. The separation of two gases by a Knudsen
flow mechanism depends on the ratio of the square
root of their corresponding molecular weights.
This means that low separation factors are gener-

A comparison between gas separation technologies [22]
ally obtained. High separation can only be
achieved via a cascade operation involving a num-
ber of modules connected together [11]. Where
the transport of gases occurs through nonporous
membranes, Knudsen flow is not involved. How-
ever, when these nonporous membranes are used
in a composite membrane where a dense top layer
is supported by a porous substructure, Knudsen
flow may contribute to the total flow depending
on the pore sizes in the sub layer. Gas separation
through nonporous membranes depends on dif-
ferences in the permeabilities of various gases
through a given membrane [11,29–31]. Ideal gas
separation membranes possess a high flux and
selectivity. However, generally a trade-off can be
observed, i.e., high fluxes or high permeabilities
are related to low selectivities and vice versa. High
permeable materials are used if high selectivities
are not required. If a moderate selectivity is re-
quired, then low permeable materials based on

The process of gas permeation is a relatively
simple process which has expanded in use rap-
idly since it was introduced commercially in 1979.
Since that time approximately 20 or more com-
panies have come to the market place with equip-
ment. The range of applications covers the sup-
ply of pure or enriched gases such as He, N2 and
O2 from air, the separation of acid gases such as
CO2 and H2S, the separation of H2 in the petro-
chemical and chemical industries and a variety of
smaller applications [22]. Table 5 shows applica-
tions established in the field of membrane gas
separation [32]. An overview of various applica-
tions and materials can be found in the literature
[7,11,33–40].
Separation of olefin and paraffin gases is one
of the most important processes in the petrochemi-
206

cal industry. In 1998, the United States produced
52 billion pounds of ethylene and 29 billion
pounds of propylene [41]. Various petrochemical
streams contain olefin and other saturated hydro-
carbons. These streams typically originate from
steam cracking units (ethylene production), cata-
lytic cracking units (motor gasoline production),
or the dehydrogenation of paraffins [42–47]. Dur-
ing the years, different processes have been used
for the separation of olefin-paraffin mixtures, such
as low-temperature distillation, extractive distil-
lation, physical or chemical adsorption and physi-
cal or chemical absorption [28].
Currently, this separation is carried out by
cryogenic distillation, which is highly energy-in-
tensive due to the cryogenic temperatures required
for the process and low relative volatilities of com-
ponents. Distillation columns are often up to 300
ft tall and typically contain over 200 trays. With
reflux ratios greater than 10, a very high energy
input is required for the distillation process. This
large capital expense and energy cost have cre-
ated incentive for extensive research in this area

of separations, and membrane separations have
been considered as an attractive alternative [48–
56]. In searching for membrane materials, one
generally looks not only for a favorable combi-
nation of required permeability and selectivity, but
also for an improvement in mechanical proper-
ties of the membrane [1].
3.1.1. Solid membranes
As olefin/paraffin separation is an important
process in petrochemical industry, in this section
the use of solid membranes in this process is re-
viewed. Furthermore, the application of
nanotechnology in the production of membranes
and their separation performance is investigated.
3.1.1.1. Olefin/paraffin separation using solid
membrane systems
Different researchers had used various poly-
meric membranes, in order to investigate the per-
formance of propylene/propane separation sys-

tem. Their experimental results are summarized
in Table 6.
3.1.1.2. Nano composite gas separation mem-
branes
Membrane gas separations are attractive be-
cause of their simplicity and low energy costs,
but often limited by insufficient gas flux. This
problem is specially challenging because the per-
meability of a material is frequently inversely re-
lated to its selectivity. Recently, polymer–inor-
ganic nano composite materials have been devel-
oped to improve the physical properties of poly-
mer membranes. The polymer-inorganic nano

composite constitutes of two matrices, i.e. poly-
mer and inorganic material. In these kinds of mem-
branes, the inorganic phase is dispersed at
nanoscale level in the polymer phase. Due to spe-
cial structural characteristics of polymer-inorganic
nano composites, the gas separation properties of
pure polymers are improved [64–66].
Kong and co-workers [67] used polyimide
(PI)/TiO2 nano composite membranes for gas
separation. The permeation properties of these
membranes are illustrated in Table 7. As it can be
seen from these results, the low TiO2 content could
not greatly enhance the permeation properties of
the composite membranes. When the TiO2 con-
tent in the composite membranes was above
208
M. Takht Ravanchi et al. / Desalination 235 (2009) 199–244
20 wt%, the permeability of the composite mem-
branes was remarkably enhanced, and selectivity
of the composite membranes was still kept at a
high level. This might be caused by the specific
interaction between gases and the TiO2 compo-
nent in PI/TiO2 composite membranes. At TiO2
content of 25wt%, the results were very interest-
ing because both of the permeability and selec-
tivity of PI membrane were enhanced at the same
time.
Hu and co-workers [68] used fluorinated poly
(amide imide) (6FPAI)/TiO2 nano composite
membranes for gas separation. The permeation
properties of these membranes are summarized
in Table 8. As it can be seen, the composite mem-
brane has shown higher selectivities for selected
gas pairs when compared to the pure poly (amide
imide) membrane, even at very low volume con-
centration of the TiO2 component. Such results
are encouraging, because they suggest that possi-
bly higher selectivities could be achieved at in-
creasingly higher concentrations of the TiO2 com-
ponent.

Zhang and co-workers [69] used nano-sized
nickel-filled carbon membranes to examine gas
separation properties. Nickel, as a very commonly
used hydrogenation catalyst was chosen because
it can selectively chemically adsorb hydrogen,
which would result in the change of hydrogen per-
meation properties of the resulting nickel-filled
carbon membranes. Permeation properties of
single gas through Ni-filled carbon membranes
are shown in Table 9. It could be seen that the
nickel amount had strong influence on the gas
permeation properties of the corresponding mem-
brane.
Gomes and co-workers [70] used nano com-
posite membranes based on poly (1-trimethylsilil-
1-propyne) (PTMSP) and organically modified
silicates (ORMOSILs) for gas separation. In nano
composite membranes different ORMOSILs were
used such as: TEOS (tetraeth oxysilane), OMDEOS
(n-octylmethyldiethoxysilane), MTEOS (methyl
triethoxysilane), OTEOS (n-octyltriethoxysilane),
VTEOS (vinyltriethoxysilane), PTDMOS (phen-

dimethoxysilane). Permeation properties of single
gases in these membranes are summarized in
Table 10. From these data, it may be seen that both
butane permeability and butane/methane selectiv-
ity of PTMSP-silica nano composite membranes
could be increased by the incorporation of
MTEOS in the membrane.
3.1.2. Liquid membranes
It is possible to use liquid as a membrane and
the same general definition of a membrane also
applies in this case: the liquid membrane or liq-
uid film separates two phases from each other.
Also here separation occurs because of differences

in solubility and diffusivity in the liquid film simi-
lar to a solid film. However, when a carrier is
present inside the membrane with the ability to
complex with a specific solute, the flux of that
solute may be enhanced. The carrier may be dis-
solved in the liquid and in this case the carrier is
mobile. On the other hand, the carrier can be
bound chemically (covalently) or physically to a
solid polymer. In this case, the carrier is fixed and
has a very restricted mobility. In the mobile car-
rier system, which is referred to as ‘liquid mem-
brane’, the carrier-solute complex diffuses across
the membrane whereas in the fixed carrier sys-
tem the solute jumps or hops from one site to the
other. It is obvious that the diffusivity in the mo-
bile system is much higher. Between these two
limits, there is a large area where the continuous
phase can be considered as a gel or a solvent swol-
len polymer and as a consequence the diffusivity
will increase. In these systems, the carrier can ei-
ther be fixed or mobile; however, when the car-
rier is fixed it still has a certain mobility com-
pared to a carrier in an unswollen system.
The mobile carrier systems are referred to as
liquid membranes. One of the benefits of using
such membranes is that they are highly selective,
and with the use of carriers for the transport
mechanism, specific molecular recognition can be
achieved [71–73]. The characteristic of a facili-
tated or carrier mediated transport in liquid mem-
brane systems is the occurrence of a reversible
chemical reaction or complexation process in
210

combination with a diffusion process. This im-
plies that two cases can be distinguished:
•
Diffusion is rate-limiting (fast reaction)
•
Reaction is rate-limiting (slow reaction and
relatively fast diffusion)
The latter case does not occur frequently and
only the former case will be considered [11,74].
Carrier mediated transport has very large and
various applications. Cations such as copper
(Cu2+), mercury (Hg2+), nickel (Ni2+), cadmium
(Cd2+), zinc (Zn2+) and lead (Pb2+), and anions such
as nitrate (NO3
-) and chromate (Cr2O7
-) can be
easily removed via facilitated transport. Gases can
also be removed by facilitated transport. Examples
are the separation of oxygen from nitrogen, the
removal of H2S from natural gas, NH3, NOx and
SO2 from waste gases, separation of hydrocarbons
and removal of phenol from waste water [11,75–
82].
Because the carrier facilitated transport pro-
cess employs a reactive carrier species, very high
membrane selectivities can be achieved. These se-
lectivities are often far larger than the selectivi-
ties achieved by other membrane processes. This
one fact has maintained interest in facilitated trans-
port for the past 30 years, but no commercial ap-
plications have developed. The principal problem
is the physical instability of the liquid membrane
and the chemical instability of the carrier agent.
In recent years a number of potential solutions to
this problem have been developed, which may yet
make carrier facilitated transport a viable process
[7,83,84].
There are three basic types of liquid mem-
branes, which are presented schematically in
Fig. 2 [85–91]:
•
Bulk liquid membrane (BLM)
•
Emulsion liquid membrane (ELM)
•
Supported liquid membrane (SLM)

In this section facilitated transport of olefin is
discussed in detail and liquid membrane systems
used for the separation of olefin/paraffin are re-
viewed.
3.1.2.1. Facilitated transport of olefin in mem-
brane
It is well known that some transition metals
react reversibly with alkenes in the solution. The
ability of the transition metal ion as a carrier is
largely dependent on the intensity of the π-com-
plexation with alkenes. The intensity of the π-
complexation with alkenes is determined prima-
rily by the electronegativity, which is a measure
of the relative strength of an atom in a molecule
to attract bonding electrons to itself. The electrone-
gativity values of transition metals are presented
in Table 11 [92]. With the greater electronegativ-
ity, the metal atom draws bonding electrons more
strongly. If the electronegativity of the metal is
excessively high, the metal is not suitable for the
facilitated carrier because it is susceptible to irre-
versible reaction with the  electrons of the alk-
ene; otherwise, if the electronegativity is too low,
the metal is impractical as a carrier due to its weak
interaction with the alkene. For reversible reac-
tion between the transition metal ion and the alk-
ene, the electronegativity of the metal is prefer-
ably in the range of 1.6–2.3. Examples of the suit-
able transition metal from Table 11 may include
Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Re,
Os, Ir, Pt.
To increase the reversible reactivity of the tran-
sition metal ion with the alkene, the anion of the
transition metal plays an important role in deter-
mining the intensity and the rate of the interac-
tion between a carrier and alkene. In order for the
transition metal to act as a carrier, the transition
metal salt is solvated on the polymer to form a
complex.
With the lower lattice energy of the transition
metal salt, the anion form a weak ionic bond or
ion pair with the cation and the salt is easily dis-
solved in a polymer. It is therefore preferable to

select the anion of the transition metal salt that
has low lattice energy with respect to the cation
of the transition metal, in order to facilitate the
solvation of the transition metal salt. The lattice
energies of the representative transition metals are
presented in Table 12.
In the facilitated transport membrane, the tran-
sition metal salt preferably has lattice energy of
less than 2500 kJ/mol, reducing the tendency of
the anion of the transition metal salt to form a
strong ion pair with the cation. Among the metal
salts listed in Table 12, the suitable anion may
include F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, CN–, NO3
–, BF4
–, ClO4
–,
CF3SO3
– or CF3CO2
–.
The tendency of the anion to form a strong ion
pair with the cation decreases in the order of F–
<<C1– < Br–<I– ≈ SCN– < ClO4

– <BF4

–, with a decrease in the lattice energy [92].
Facilitated transport of olefin is shown in
Fig. 3. Olefin is complexed with a complexing
agent B such as Ag+ incorporated in the mem-
brane at high-pressure side. The complex diffuses
owing to its concentration difference across the
membrane from the high-pressure side to the low-
pressure side, where decomplexation takes place
to release the olefin. The complexing agent re-
generated from the decomplexation, diffuses back
to the high-pressure side due to its concentration
difference between the low- and high-pressure

sides. This completes a facilitated transport cycle,
and the complexing agent repeats the cycles. Be-
cause of the complexation, the concentration of
the olefin in the membrane is increased, and the
transport of the olefin is thus facilitated. On the
other hand, paraffin cannot complex with the
complexing agent, and the majority of the paraf-
fin is thus rejected by the membrane. The con-
centration of the paraffin in the membrane is small
by physical solubility, and its transport rate
through the membrane is thus low. Therefore, the
facilitated transport membrane can give a high
olefin/paraffin selectivity to yield a permeate with
high olefin purity [93,94].
3.1.2.2. Olefin/paraffin separation using liq-
uid membrane systems
In order to improve the performance of poly-
meric membranes, it is possible to incorporate sil-
ver salts in the membrane system, since it has a
facilitation effect [95–100]. During 1993–1997,
BP-Amoco had successfully developed a high
efficiency process for the separation of light ole-
fins from the corresponding paraffins using fa-
cilitated transport and micro-porous polypropy-
lene hollow-fiber contactors. They used silver
nitrate as complexing agent for facilitation trans-
port and they did the separation experiments in

bench-scale and pilot plant [101]. In Table 13 dif-
ferent membrane systems with various polymers
and silver salts for the separation of propylene-
propane mixtures are reviewed.
In order to improve the performance of poly-
mer–silver salt complex membranes, some re-
searchers used a third component in the membrane
system. An overview of these membrane systems
can be found in literature [102–123].
3.2. Liquid separation by membranes
In this section, separation of light solvents and
solvent dewaxing by a membrane system are re-
viewed. Petrochemical waste streams may con-
tain phenolic compounds or aromatic amines.
They are highly toxic and at high concentrations
are inhibitory to biological treatment. Membrane
aromatic recovery system (MARS) which is a rela-
tively new process for recovery of aromatic acids
and bases is described, and finally, the applica-
tion of membrane in the delivering/receiving sta-
tions with the aim of emission control is investi-
gated.
3.2.1. Separation of light hydrocarbons
Pervaporation offers the possibility of sepa-
rating solutions, mixtures of components with
close boiling points, or azeotropes that are diffi-
cult to separate by distillation or other means. The
first systematic work on pervaporation was done
by Binning and co-workers at American Oil in
the 1950s. The process was not commercialized
at that time and remained a mild academic curi-
osity until 1982, when GFT (Gesellschaft für
Trenntechnik GmbH, Germany) installed the first
commercial pervaporation plant. That plant sepa-
rated water from concentrated alcohol solutions;
GFT has since installed more than 50 such plants.
In these plants, polyvinyl alcohol is used as com-
posite membranes; they are far more permeable
to water than alcohol. A flow scheme of a GFT
plant combining distillation and pervaporation to
produce dry alcohol is shown in Fig. 4. The etha-
nol feed to the membrane generally contains ~10%
water. The pervaporation process removes the
water as the permeate, producing pure ethanol
with less than 1% water and avoiding all the prob-
lems of azeotropic distillation.

Spurred on by this success, a great deal of ef-
fort is being made to apply pervaporation to other
difficult separations. Another commercial per-
vaporation application is the separation of dissolved
VOCs (volatile organic compound) from water,
developed by Membrane Technology and Research,
Inc. Relatively hydrophobic composite mem-
branes, such as silicone rubber coated on a micro-
porous polyimide support membrane, are used.
Extremely high separation factors can be obtained
for the more hydrophobic VOCs such as toluene,
benzene, chlorinated solvents, esters and ethers.
Another commercial pervaporation processes
involve the separation of organics and water. This
separation is relatively easy, because organic sol-
vents and water have very different polarity and
exhibit distinct membrane permeation properties.
The first pilot-plant result for an organic–organic
application, the separation of methanol from me-
thyl t-butyl ether/isobutene mixtures, was reported
by Separex in 1988. This is a particularly favor-
able application and available cellulose acetate
membranes achieve a good separation [2,7].
More recently, Exxon started a pervaporation
pilot plant for the separation of aromatic/aliphatic
mixtures, using polyimide/poly urethane block co-
polymer membranes. This separation is one of the
major separation problems in refineries [131, 11].
3.2.2. Solvent dewaxing
A promising new application of reverse osmo-
sis in the chemical industry is the separation of
organic/organic mixtures. These separations are
difficult because of the high osmotic pressures that
must be overcome and because they require mem-
branes that are sufficiently solvent resistant to be
mechanically stable, but are also sufficiently per-
meable for good fluxes to be obtained. Nonethe-
less, this is an area of keen industrial interest, and
from 1988 to 1998 more than 30 US patents cov-
ering membranes and membrane systems for these
applications were issued.
One application that has already reached the
commercial stage is the separation of small sol-
vent molecules from larger hydrocarbons in mix-
tures resulting from the extraction of vacuum re-
sidual oil in refineries [132,133]. Fig. 5a shows a
simplified flow diagram of a refining lube oil sepa-
ration process — these operations are very large.
In a typical 100,000 barrel/d refinery about 15,000
barrel/d of the oil entering the refinery remain as
residual oil. A large fraction of this oil is sent to
the lube oil plant, where the heavy oil is mixed
with 3–10 volumes of a solvent such as methyl
ethyl ketone and toluene. On cooling the mixture,
the heavy wax components precipitate out and are
removed by a drum filter. The light solvent is then
stripped from the lube oil by vacuum distillation
and recycled through the process. The vacuum
distillation step is very energy intensive because
of the high solvent-to-oil ratios employed.
In 1998, a reverse osmosis process was devel-
oped by Mobil for this separation which is illus-
trated in Fig. 5b. Polyimide membranes formed
into spiral-wound modules are used to separate
up to 80% of the solvent from the dewaxed oil.
The membranes have a flux of 10-20 gal/ft2d at a
pressure of 450–650 psi. The solvent filtrate by-
passes the distillation step and is recycled directly
to the incoming oil feed. The net result is a sig-
nificant reduction in the refrigeration load required
to cool the oil and in the size and energy con-
sumption of the solvent recovery vacuum distil-
lation section.
Mobil is now licensing this technology to other
refineries. Development of similar applications in
other operations is likely. Initially, applications
will probably involve relatively easy separations
such as the separation of methyl ethyl ketone/tolu-
ene from lube oil described above or soybean oil
from hexane in food oil production. Long term,
however, the technology may become sufficiently
advanced to be used in more important refining
operations, such as fractionation of linear from
branched paraffins, or the separation of benzene
and other aromatics from paraffins and olefins in
the gasoline pool [134].

3.2.3. Phenol and aromatic recovery
Phenolic compounds are used in phenolic res-
ins, polycarbonates, biocides and agrochemicals.
Aromatic amines are used in a wide range of con-
sumer products, including polyurethane foam,
dyes, rubber chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The
factories that manufacture and/or use these types
of chemicals often create aqueous waste streams
containing significant (0.1–10 wt%) amounts of
aromatic amines or phenolic compounds [136].
Phenol is an aromatic acid, with a solubility
of 8 wt.% in water at 25°C. This compound is
highly toxic and one of the EPA’s priority pollut-
ants. Two of the main commercial applications
for phenol are production of bisphenol A and phe-
nol-formaldehyde resins. Phenol and formalde-
hyde are the main reagents in the phenol-formal-
dehyde resin production process [137].
Fig. 5. Simplified flow schemes of (a) a conventional and (b) Mobil Oil’s membrane solvent dewaxing processes [135].
Since phenol is highly toxic and at high con-
centration (>200 mg/l) are inhibitory to biologi-
cal treatment, the recovery of phenol from indus-
trial wastewater streams has generated significant
interest. Methods for the recovery of phenol in-
clude solvent extraction, activated carbon and
polymer adsorption, and membrane processes
[138].
Membrane technologies have attracted atten-
tion for removal of low-volatility organics from
wastewaters. Porous membranes have been used
for membrane solvent extraction for the recovery
of organics from aqueous solutions. However,
porous membranes have a major shortcoming due
to their instability, i.e. breakthrough of the im-
mobilized phase in the pores can occur unless a
high breakthrough pressure through the membrane
is maintained. Nonporous membranes were pro-
posed for carrying out extraction. Compared to
M. Takht Ravanchi et al. / Desalination 235 (2009) 199–244
217
porous membranes, the breakthrough pressure is
much higher through nonporous membranes;
however, this is at the expense of a lower mass
transfer rate in the membrane extraction.
The membrane aromatic recovery system
(MARS) is a relatively new process for recovery
of aromatic acids and bases [139–142]. In the
MARS process aromatics are selectively removed
from a wastewater stream into the stripping solu-
tion via a tubular silicone rubber membrane with
a wall thickness of 500 μm. For aromatic bases
(e.g. aniline) the stripping solution is maintained
at an acidic pH using HCl and for aromatic acids
(e.g. phenol) the stripping solution is maintained
at a basic pH using NaOH. The operating prin-
ciple of MARS for recovery of phenolic com-
pounds is shown in Fig. 6 [143].
The mass transfer rate of water through the
membrane is negligible due to the hydrophobic-
ity of the tubular silicone rubber membrane, com-
bined with its relatively large thickness. Ion trans-
port is also negligible; hence the ionic form of
the aromatic, formed in the stripping solution,
cannot pass back across the membrane into the
Fig. 6. The operating principle of MARS for recovery of phenolic compounds [137].
wastewater solution. This not only keeps the aro-
matic in the stripping solution but also maintains
the driving force across the membrane [143].
MARS technology has been successfully ap-
plied for the recovery of phenol and aniline at lab
and pilot plant scale [136]. It has also been ap-
plied on full plant scale for recovery of p-cresol
since December 2002 at Degussa plant in Knot-
tingley UK [139].
3.2.4. Control emission at delivering-receiv-
ing stations
A spin-off of the activities of gasoline vapor
recovery at gasoline tank farms is the develop-
ment of a system to reduce emissions generated
by the operation of petrol stations. In the case of
car refueling, the connection between the dis-
penser nozzles and the petroleum tank filler pipe
is the only area open to the atmosphere. To re-
duce emissions during refueling vacuum assisted
vapor return systems have been introduced in
many countries. In order to avoid the emission
transfer from the tank filling point of the car to

the vent pipes of the storage tanks, an air over
liquid ratio of 1:1 of the vapor return system has
been stipulated. An investigation of the TÜV
Rheinland has shown that the efficiency of catch-
ing emissions by means of the 1:1 vapor return
ratio is limited to an average of approx. 75%. The
difference between a minimum value of 50% and
a maximum value of 90% in vapor return is caused
by differences in the construction of car filling
pipes. In order to enhance the vapor return rates,
a surplus of air/vapor volume has to be returned.
Tests have shown that the increase of the air over
liquid ratio to 1.5:1 leads to an improvement of
the efficiency of between 95–99%, depending on
the type of the car. The enhancement of the vapor
return rate is only possible if no additional emis-
sions are generated. A membrane-based vapor
separation system to treat the breather pipe vent
gases of storage tanks enables emission reduction
during car refueling without creating any addi-
tional emissions. The essential requirement is a
leakage proof installation of tanks, pipes and dis-
pensers. Furthermore, the installation of over/un-
der pressure safety valves at breather pipes and
check valves at the filling and vapor-balancing
couplings of the storage tanks. Because of the
surplus of returned vapor volume, a pressure
build-up occurs in the storage tanks. At a given
set point of a pressure gauge, which measures the
differential pressure between tank pressure and
atmospheric pressure, e.g. 6 mbar, the vacuum
pump of a membrane separation system is acti-
vated. This system is installed parallel to the vent
stack of the storage tanks. A pneumatic valve in
the retentate line of the membrane module is
opened by the applied vacuum. The overpressure
of the storage tanks causes a volume flow, which
is released by passing the membrane stack. The
gasoline vapors are separated from the off-gas and
clean air enters to the atmosphere. After the lower
set point of the pressure gauge, e.g. 3 mbar, is
reached, the system is deactivated (Fig. 7). Be-
sides the advantage of emission reduction, the wet
stock losses of gasoline storage can be reduced
because diffusive emissions are avoided and most
of the generated gasoline vapor is returned to the
storage tank [144].
Because of the simplicity and the nearly main-
tenance free operation, the system is particularly
suitable for petrol station applications and prod-
uct delivering-receiving stations at petrochemi-
cal plants.
4. Membrane reactors
Membranes are mainly used for concentration,
purification and fractionation. However, they may
be coupled to a chemical reaction to shift the
chemical equilibrium and the combination is de-
fined as a membrane reactor. In this case one of
the end products is removed to shift the reaction
to the right side and consequently the conversion
rate or final product concentration has been en-
hanced. The final result is an improvement of the
productivity. Moreover, in most cases a purifica-
tion step occurs as well, which makes a combina-
tion of reaction and purification. Also from an en-

ergy point of view, it is more favorable than con-
ventional processes [11,145,146].
The concept of combining membranes and re-
actors is being explored in various configurations,
which can be classified in three groups, regard-
ing the role of the membrane in the process. The
membrane can act as an extractor (the removal of
product(s) increases the conversion by shifting the
reaction equilibrium), as a distributor (the con-
trolled addition of reactant(s) along the reactor
wall limits side reactions), or as an active contactor
(the controlled diffusion of reactants to the cata-
lyst can lead to an engineered catalytic reaction
zone). In the two first cases the membrane has
usually no catalytic properties and is combined,
for example, with a fixed bed of catalyst placed
on one membrane side. In the active contactor
mode, the membrane acts as a diffusion barrier
and plays the role of a catalyst whereas separa-
tion properties are usually not required. The con-
cept can be used with a forced flow-mode or with
an opposing reactant mode. The forced flow
contactor mode has been applied to the total oxi-
dation of VOC. The distributor mode is usually
well adapted to limit consecutive and parallel deep
oxidation reactions for partial oxidation, oxida-
tive dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and oxi-
dative coupling of methane. For these reactions,
the local oxygen concentration at the catalytic site
greatly influences both hydrocarbon conversion
and product selectivity [147–152].
A membrane is going to add cost to any pro-
cess, so for it to be cost effective, it must give one
other advantage that outweigh the added cost. The
original driving force behind catalytic membrane
reactors is often to reduce the number of units
concerned. To do so, one cannot substitute it with
more expensive or exotic methods of separation.
There are critical operational features of a mem-
brane that one needs to be successful. These in-
clude:
•
A material with a very good separation factor
(small values such as 1.1, 2.2 are not going to
drive one to spend the extra cost). Separation
factors of > 5 or approaching infinity are what
one will ultimately need.
•
High flux (rate of flow of permeating species
per unit area of membrane surface).
•
High quality membrane materials: the mem-
brane material must be stable over many
months of operation and the working layer
must be flawless.
Inorganic or organic membranes can be used
in a membrane reactor. The advantages of inor-
ganic membranes have been recognized for a long
time. Thermal and pH resistance characteristics
of inorganic membranes are the most important
advantages. The operable temperature limits of
inorganic membranes are obviously much higher
than those of organic polymeric membranes. The
majority of organic membranes begin to deterio-
rate structurally around 100°C. Thermal stability
of membranes is becoming not only a technical
problem but also an economical issue. In gas sepa-
ration applications, for example, if the membrane
can withstand the required high process tempera-
tures, the need to ramp down the temperature to
maintain the physical integrity of an organic mem-
brane and to ramp up the temperature again after
separation, can be eliminated.
Inorganic membranes generally can withstand
organic solvents, chlorine and other chemicals
better than organic membranes. This also permits
the use of more effective and yet corrosive clean-
ing procedures and chemicals. Many organic
membranes are susceptible to microbial attack
during applications. This is not the case with in-
organic types, particularly ceramic membranes.
In addition, inorganic membranes in general do
not suffer from the mechanical instability of many
organic membranes where the porous support
structure can undergo compaction under high pres-
sures and cause decrease in permeability. It is
obvious that in a high temperature or harsh chemi-
cal environment, inorganic membranes could be-
come the only recourse to many challenging sepa-
ration applications.

Another very important operating character-
istic of inorganic membranes is the phenomena
of fouling and concentration polarization. Con-
centration polarization is the accumulation of the
solutes, molecules or particles retained or rejected
by the membrane near its surface. It is deleteri-
ous to the purity of the product and the decline of
the permeate flux. Fouling is generally believed
to occur when the adsorption of the rejected com-
ponents on the membrane surface is strong enough
to cause deposition. How to maintain a clean
membrane surface so that the membrane can be
continuously used without much interruption has
been a key operational issue with many mem-
branes. First of all some inorganic membranes
such as microporous alumina membranes and sur-
face treated porous glass membranes are more
fouling resistant due to their low protein adsorp-
tion. Secondly, many inorganic membranes are
less susceptible to biological and microbial deg-
radation. And finally with some inorganic mem-
branes, for example porous ceramic and metallic
membranes, it is possible to apply short bursts of
permeate streams in the reverse direction through
the membrane to dislodge some clogged pores of
the membrane. This is referred to as back flush.
This way the maintenance cycle of the membrane
system can be prolonged. Because of the unique
characteristics of inorganic membranes mentioned
above, the search for inorganic membranes of
practical significance has been continuing for sev-
eral decades.
Organic polymer membranes can only with-
stand relatively mild conditions such as those pre-
vailing in biocatalysts involving enzymes and mi-
croorganisms and in some areas of homogeneous
catalysis. Thus early studies of membrane reac-
tors mostly dealt with low temperature reactions
or enzyme-catalyzed biotechnology applications
such as saccharification of celluloses and hydroly-
sis of proteins.
Many catalytic processes of industrial impor-
tance, however, involve the combination of high
temperature and chemically harsh environments,
a factor that strongly favors inorganic membranes.
So with the introduction of commercially avail-
able glass, ceramic and metal membranes, there
has been a dramatic surge of interest in the field
of membrane reactor or membrane catalysis. Some
promising applications using inorganic mem-
branes include certain dehydrogenation, hydro-
genation and oxidation reactions such as forma-
tion of butadiene from butane by dehydrogena-
tion, styrene production from dehydrogenation of
ethyl benzene, dehydrogenation of ethane to
ethene, water-gas shift reaction and oxidative cou-
pling of methane, to name just a few [153].
In membrane reactor two basic concepts can
be distinguished as illustrated by the reaction
A ⇔B:
•
Reaction and separation are combined in one
unit (Fig. 8a)
•
Reaction and separation are not combined and
the reactants are recycled along a membrane
system (Fig. 8b)
The former concept is used especially in com-
bination with inorganic membranes (ceramics,
metals) and with polymeric membranes where the
catalyst is coupled to the membrane. The latter
concept can be applied with any membrane pro-
cess and type of membranes, organic and inor-
ganic. In fact any membrane process can be ap-
plied to remove a specific component such as
microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, gas
separation, vapor permeation, pervaporation,
membrane distillation, electrodialysis, dialysis,
diffusion dialysis, membrane contactors and fa-
cilitated type of processes.
Most chemical reactions are equilibrium and
employ a catalyst to enhance the kinetics. The
compounds involved in the reactions are either
liquid or gaseous. In the latter case the tempera-
ture is often higher. Furthermore, the conversion
is often strongly temperature dependant, which
implies that each specific reaction is carried out
at a specific temperature which is often higher
than room temperature.

The catalyst must be combined with the mem-
brane system and various arrangements are pos-
sible. Fig. 9 summarizes some membrane-cata-
lyst combinations for tubular membranes [11].
The most simple and straightforward system
is where the catalyst is located inside the bore of
the tube (Fig. 9a). The advantage of this system is
its simplicity in preparation and operation and in
case of catalyst poisoning a new catalyst can eas-
ily be introduced. In the other two arrangements
the catalyst is immobilized onto the membrane,
either in the top layer (Fig. 9b) or in the mem-
brane wall (Fig. 9c). In either case one of the prod-
ucts, not necessarily the required product, should
permeate across the membrane which implies the
necessity of permselective membranes under these
specific conditions. At certain concentrations or
partial pressures and at a certain temperature and
pressure the equilibrium is completely fixed and
thermodynamically determined. However, by re-
moving one of the end products the reaction is
shifted to the right hand side and results in an
enhanced conversion rate.
Also the controlled addition of a reactant may
enhance the productivity. Membrane processes are
well suited to remove either a gaseous or liquid
compound. Furthermore, they can be made cata-
lytically active and employed at increased tem-

Typical examples for inorganic membrane re-
actors are dehydrogenation, where hydrogen is
removed and oxidation and hydrogenation where
oxygen and hydrogen are added and some of these
are summarized in Table 14 [11,145,154–156].
The number of possible applications is large
but the commercial applications are emerging
slowly due to a number of practical limitations
such as low separation factor, leakage at higher
temperatures, poisoning of catalyst and mass
transfer limitations [11].
Many membrane reactors are demonstrated by
using a sweep gas or a vacuum to assist in the
permeation of a species, but in a commercial op-
eration those will not be acceptable; ultimately,
one has to be able to drive the separation with a
method which does not dilute the permeating
product (thus losing one of the key attributes of a
membrane) or demand high energy input to per-
form additional separation.

coupling of methane, steam reforming of meth-
ane and water-gas shift reaction, which are im-
portant to petrochemical industry are discussed.
4.1.1. Dehydrogenation
One of the most important petrochemical re-
actions by which hydrogen is produced, is dehy-
drogenation. Some of the dehydrogenation reac-
tions frequently used in petrochemical industry
are summarized in Table 14 and will be reviewed
below.
For the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to
benzene, Itoh [157] used a 0.05 in thick Pd/Ag
membrane tube containing a 0.5% Pt/Al2O3 cata-
lyst to achieve 99% conversion. In this membrane
reactor, an argon sweep gas was used to carry
away the H2 permeating through the Pd mem-
brane. The reaction over the catalyst was run at
200oC and 1atm, using an argon stream saturated
with cyclohexane vapor. In order to achieve sub-
stantial conversion, the actual feed rate over the
catalyst had to be maintained very low and resi-
dence times ranged from 2.5 to 14.5 min. Space
time yields of benzene were 0.0126 mole of ben-
zene/kg catalyst/h, which corresponds to about 1gr
benzene/kg catalyst/hr (about 1000 times lower
than the commercial catalyst units) [157, 158].
Kikuchi and co-workers [159–162] used a Pd
alloy coated onto a mesoporous membrane sup-
port for the dehydrogenation of isobutane. In their
study, isobutane was passed over a Pt/Al2O3 cata-
lyst contained within the membrane. The yield of
isobutylene rose from the equilibrium value of 6%
(demonstrated in the absence of a membrane) to
23% at 400°C with this membrane.

For the dehydrogenation of propane, Brinker
and co-workers [163] used a Pd film coated on a
mesoporous Al2O3 support. Propylene yields rose
from the equilibrium value of 30% (in the absence
of a membrane) to 40% at 550°C.
Reforming via dehydrocyclization of heptane
is another dehydrogenation reaction. Ali and
Baiker [164] used a system of two plug flow re-
actors with an interstage Pd/Ag membrane for ex
situ H2 separation from the product stream of the
first reactor using a commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst
for toluene production. With this system, at 400°C
and 17 atm, 65% higher toluene yield was ob-
tained.
Ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to styrene is
another worthy of mention dehydrogenation re-
action in petrochemical industry. Liu and co-work-
ers [165] studied a two stage packed bed reactor
followed by a membrane reactor. The tubular 40°A
alumina mesoporous membrane was packed with
a commercial K promoted iron oxide catalyst used
for styrene production. In this system, a 4% yield
enhancement to styrene was observed.
Liang and Hughes [166] used a palladium/sil-
ver membrane reactor, containing a platinum cata-
lyst within the membrane tube, for the dehydro-
genation of isobutane to isobutene. For a tempera-
ture of 485°C at a residence time of 3.5 s, using
100 ml/min of sweep gas (N2), the yield was 15%
and using 1000 ml/min of sweep gas (N2), the yield
was 20%. At a higher temperature of 520°C and
residence time of 3.5 s, the yield of isobutene was
22% and 29% for the 100 ml/min and 1000 ml/
min of sweep gas (N2).
Bobrov and co-workers [167] investigated the
propane dehydrogenation using inorganic mem-
branes with molybdenum (Mo) selective layer.
The maximum selectivity to propylene for Mo-
ceramic membrane (Mo coated on ceramic sup-
port) was 63% (at 853 K and conversion to pro-
pane 17%). The maximum selectivity to propy-
lene for Mo-carbon membrane (Mo coated on
carbon support) was 84% (at 853K and conver-
sion to propane 28%).
Sznejer and Sheintuch [168] used a membrane
reactor, equipped with a molecular-sieve carbon
membrane, for isobutane dehydrogenation on a
chrome alumina catalyst. Two types of operation
mode were studied, using nitrogen as a sweep gas
in counter-current flow or using vacuum as a driv-
ing force for membrane transport. At 500°C, in
counter-current flow operation, the conversion of
85% was obtained and in the vacuum mode, the
conversion of 40% was obtained.
Ahchieva and co-workers [169] studied the
performance of a fluidized bed membrane reac-
tor (FLBMR) for the catalytic oxidative dehydro-
genation of ethane using γ-alumina supported va-
nadium oxide catalyst. The experimental results
were compared to the conventional operation such
as fluidized bed reactor (FLBR). Ethylene selec-
tivity is higher in the FLBMR (up to 20%) than
in the FLBR. The maximum ethylene yield ob-
served was 36.6% for the FLBMR and 23.3% for
the FLBR. It means FLBMR performance is near
1.6 times higher than that of the FLBR.

4.1.2. Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM)
With depletion in liquid petroleum, natural gas
containing primarily methane (>95%) is increas-
ingly expected to be one of the main resources
for production of chemicals and liquid fuels. So
far, there are mainly two different methods that
have been studied in converting methane to chemi-
cals and liquid fuels, namely, direct or indirect
routs. The direct rout is the oxidative coupling of
methane (OCM) into C2 products (ethane and eth-
ylene), and the indirect route is the production of
syngas (H2 and CO mixture) by steam reforming
or partial oxidative reaction of methane followed
by a further conversion into higher hydrocarbons
by the Fischer–Tropsch process. Comparatively,
the direct route is economically more promising
if the C2 yield can be remarkably improved. Be-
cause the C2 products from the OCM reaction are
more reactive in nature than the starting reactant
(methane), they are easily deep oxidized, leading
to low selectivities. Therefore, the inherent limit
to C2 yields in conventional catalyst packed-bed
reactors is around 25%. To achieve an economi-
cally attractive C2 yield (> 30–40%), consider-
able interests have been recently devoted to the
development of various membrane reactors. By
the addition of oxygen discretely through a mem-
brane along the length of the reactor, the local
methane-to-oxygen ratio in the reaction zone can
be kept high so that a much higher C2 selectivity
than that in a conventional reactor can be obtained.
As a result, the C2 yield can be greatly increased
once the total amount of oxygen introduced into
the reactor is high enough for methane conver-
sion [170].
There are two types of membrane reactors that
have been studied for OCM over the past decade:
(1) porous ceramic membrane reactors and (2)
dense ionic or mixed-conducting oxide membrane
reactors. In general, the porous membranes such
as alumina, zirconia, or Vycor glass have high sta-
bility for the reactions but low oxygen selectiv-
ity. However, for the dense ionic or mixed-con-
ducting oxide membranes, the oxygen selectivity
is theoretically infinite, and thus air can be used
as an oxygen source without contaminating the
products with nitrogen and nitrogen oxides. In
addition, some oxides such as Bi1.5Y0.3Sm0.2O3 - ˜
and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 - ˜ also exhibit noticeable
catalytic activity for OCM, this would further pro-
mote the formation of C2 products.
Although C2 selectivities up to 90–95% have
been reported for OCM in dense ceramic mem-
brane reactors, the C2 yields are generally low (be-
tween 1 and 10%) because of the low oxygen per-
meation flux. This suggests that efforts should be
placed in improving the oxygen permeation flux
of the mixed-conducting membranes so as to
achieve a high C2 yield. In most studies, disk-
shaped membranes with a limited membrane area
(<5 cm2) have been employed to perform OCM.
Such membranes obviously fail to provide enough
oxygen for methane conversion. Recently, tubu-
lar dense membranes have been developed for
OCM, resulting in a much higher C2 yield. How-
ever, the small surface area/volume ratio and the
relatively high membrane thickness that would
lower the oxygen permeation rate make them un-
favorable in practical applications. Recently, hol-
low-fiber ceramic membranes with an asymmet-
ric structure (i.e. a thin dense and separating layer
integrated with a porous substrate of the same
material) have been used. Compared to disk-
shaped membranes, such hollow-fiber membranes
possess much larger membrane area per unit vol-
ume values for oxygen permeation. All of these
advantages of the hollow-fiber ceramic mem-
brane, i.e. the asymmetric structure and hollow-
fiber geometry, are beneficial in commercializ-
ing mixed-conducting membrane reactors for
OCM.
In a novel membrane reactor for OCM where
a dense semi-permeable ionic conductor is used,
the contact mode of oxygen and methane is con-
trolled. Two approaches have been reported us-
ing these types of membrane reactors to improve
the selectivity and yield of OCM. In the first ap-
M. Takht Ravanchi et al. / Desalination 235 (2009) 199–244
225
proach, the membrane is used as the oxygen sepa-
rator (if the air is used as the reactant) and oxy-
gen distributor [171,172]. The other approach re-
quires that the surface of the oxygen semi-per-
meable membrane is catalytically active and se-
lective for OCM. In this case oxygen permeates
through the membrane and reacts, in the form of
non-molecular oxygen, with membrane on the
other surface of the membrane. This approach
minimizes the amount of the gas-phase oxygen
in the membrane stream, therefore reducing the
total oxidation reactions in the gas phase.
Table 15 summarizes the work published on
the second approach for OCM. The membranes
used in these studies were made of both perovskite
and fluorite type materials. In most cases, the
membrane surface is not modified with other cata-
lysts except for the work reported by Nozaki and
Fujimoto [173] and Guo and co-workers [174].
Most reactors employed disk-shaped perovskite
type ceramic membranes and offered very low C2
yields (<4%) because of the low surface activity
of the membrane material and unfavorable disk
geometry of the membrane. Among the perovskite
type ceramic membrane reactors, the highest C2
yield (16.5%) was obtained by Lu and co-work-
ers [175] using a tubular BaGe0.8Gd0.2O3 mem-
brane. Zeng and co-workers [176] optimized the
methane-to-helium ratio and showed that a
perovskite type La0.8Sr0.2Co0.6Fe0.4O3 membrane
was more active and selective for OCM under the
conditions of p-type electronic conduction. The
OCM  activity  (C2  formation  rate)  for  a
La0.8Sr0.2Co0.6Fe0.4O3 membrane reported by Zeng
and co-workers is an order of magnitude higher
than that for the BaGe0.8Gd0.2O3 membrane sur-
face reported by Lu and co-workers. However,
the latter (in tubular geometry) offers a higher C2
yield than the former (in disk geometry). This re-
sult suggests that the membrane geometry has a
strong effect on the performance of the membrane
reactor. However, a strict comparison could not
be made on these two membrane reactors because
the membrane materials were different.
The results summarized in Table 15 also show
that fluorite-structured bismuth oxide based mem-
branes are catalytically very active and selective
for OCM. The surface activity of the bismuth
oxide based membranes is about 2 orders of mag-
nitude higher than those of most perovskite type
ceramic membranes studied. The C2 yields for the
membrane reactors made of the disk-shaped bis-
muth oxide membranes are comparable to the tu-
bular perovskite type membranes reported by Lu
and co-workers. The results on the perovskite type
ceramic membrane reactors suggest that the mem-
brane in tubular geometry is more favorable for
obtaining higher yield.
4.1.3. Steam reforming of methane (SMR)
Hydrogen and syngas (a mixture of CO and
H2) are more economically produced nowadays
by steam reforming of methane. As CH4 is a stable
hydrocarbon, extremely high reaction tempera-
tures and pressures, around 800oC and 20atm are
required for endothermic reaction (1). Carbon
monoxide is further reformed with steam to CO2
and H2 by exothermic reaction (2).

If H2 is selectively removed from the reaction
system, thermodynamic positions of these reac-
tions are shifted to the product sides and highly
efficient conversion of CH4 to CO2 and H2 can be
attained and it can be accomplished even at low
temperatures. Selective removal of hydrogen in a
membrane reactor enabled the hydrogen produc-
tion by steam reforming at lower reaction tem-
peratures than conventional processes [184].
By using a Pd alloy membrane which is packed
with traditional SMR catalyst, the interest is to
shift the reaction to produce more H2 at lower
operating temperatures. This membrane would
also produce pure H2 thus eliminate extensive H2
purification steps [185].

Uemiya and co-workers [186] showed that
SMR can be enhanced using an alumina supported
Ni catalyst contained within an 80 μ Pd on Pd/23%
Ag alloy membrane coated onto a porous glass
tube. At a steam/CH4 = 3, they achieved enhanced
conversion of CH4 approaching 80% at 1atm and
500°C vs. an equilibrium value of ~42%.
Laegsgaard and co-workers [187] used a com-
mercial Ni/MgO SMR catalyst contained within
a 100 μ Pd/Ag tubular alloy membrane. At 6 atm
and 500°C, CH4 conversion of 51% compared to
equilibrium value of 21% was obtained.
Kusakabe and co-workers [188] studied the
steam reforming of methane in a membrane reac-
tor over Ce-Zr-O2-supported metal catalysts. At
500°C, 10 wt% Ni/Ce0.15-Zr0.85-O2 support showed
highest H2/CO ratio (equal to 117.1). The highest
activity was obtained for the Rh/Ce0.15-Zr0.85-O2
catalyst for which the methane conversion was
28.1% at 500°C.
Tong and Matsumura [189] investigated steam
reforming of methane over a commercial nickel
catalyst in a palladium membrane on a stainless
steel porous metal filter. At 0.3 MPa, 773 K and
space velocity 1120 h–1, CH4 conversion of about
98% was obtained.
In summary, with regard to SMR, there ap-
pears to be greater opportunity for application of
membrane reactors, but significant challenges do
remain. One must develop membranes with high
H2 flux in order to be competitive with current
SMR technology, the membranes must be highly
selective (preferentially permselective to H2), and
the membrane device must be fabricated with
durable, high temperature seals to the rest of the
process unit. Attention must be paid to the possi-
bility of carbon formation on the membrane, since
commercial SMR reactors are noted for their long
term reliability with a 5-year catalyst life. The high
reaction temperature for SMR places a big hurdle
on near term implementation of catalytic mem-
brane reactors to SMR technology [190].
4.1.4. Water–gas shift (WGS) reaction
Hydrogen as a carrier to be employed in a clean
energy process has attracted a great deal of atten-
tion in the last few decades and new technologies
such as polymer electrolyte fuel cells, requiring
CO-free hydrogen, have promoted improvements
in the H2 production cycle. Light hydrocarbons
represent a more realistic way to produce hydro-
gen and many studies on the use of catalytic mem-
brane reactors in integrated plants for hydrogen
production with low CO content have been car-
ried out [191,192].
Currently the hydrogen produced by reform-
ing and/or partial oxidation of light hydrocarbons,
such as natural gas, contains carbon monoxide,
carbon dioxide, water and a small amount of CH4.
For this reason one fundamental step of the inte-
grated membrane plant for hydrogen production
is the upgrading of the streams coming from the
reformer, generally consisting in water gas shift
(WGS) reaction, necessary to reduce the CO con-
tent and in the meantime producing more hydro-
gen:

This reaction is exothermic [191,193].
A promising approach for this reaction is the
use of membrane reactors, combining the reac-
tion and H2 separation through a selective mem-
brane. Therefore, the use of a membrane reactor
for the WGS reaction allows higher conversion
also at higher temperature where the thermody-
namic conversion is low, acting positively on the
kinetics. As a consequence, the catalyst amount
necessary for a given conversion can be signifi-
cantly reduced. For instance, working at 280°C
and 200 kPa the catalyst volume necessary to
reach the 99% of the traditional reactor equilib-
rium conversion reduces to 1/2 of a traditional
reactor using a membrane reactor with a silica
membrane and to 1/3 using a Pd-alloy membrane,
228

at the same operating conditions [194,195]. H2-
separation membranes have been developed us-
ing various materials, such as palladium and its
alloys, silica and alumina, etc. Palladium–alloy
membranes were successfully used for hydrogen
production/separation but they have disadvan-
tages, such as high costs, degradation of H2 sepa-
ration performance and, in the temperature range
useful for the WGS with low temperature cata-
lyst, the embitterment. Considerable attention has
been attracted by the use of silica membrane for
the WGS reaction because of the low membrane
cost, the generally high permeating flux, no inhi-
bition effect by chemical species and high ther-
mal stability. However, generally the silica sup-
ported membrane even if shows high permeating
fluxes exhibits low selectivities, therefore, the im-
provement of H2 selectivity of this membrane type
is an important issue and a balance between per-
meance and selectivity is essential to achieve an
optimum performance. The presence of an inter-
mediate layer between the active layer and the
support is expected to improve the selectivity. One
of the attractive candidates for the high
permselective membrane is a silica layer formed
on mesoporous γ-alumina film, supported on a
porous stainless steel [196].
Brunetti and co-workers [196] investigated
WGS reaction in a membrane reactor using a po-
rous stainless steel supported silica membrane and
a CuO/CeO2 based commercial catalyst in a tem-
perature range of 220–290°C up to 600 kPa. At
280°C and 400 kPa, they obtained a CO conver-
sion of 95%.
4.2. Membrane bio-reactors (MBRs)
Activated sludge processes (ASPs) have
widely been used for biological wastewater and
sewage treatment. However, since the settling of
activated sludge for solid–liquid separation is dif-
ficult by gravitational settling, the biomass con-
centration which can be controlled is limited to
approximately 5000 mg/L [197]. Therefore, bio-
reactor volume becomes large. On account of the
difficulty of solid-liquid separation in biological
wastewater treatment, MBR has been proposed
and since 1960’s many researches have been con-
ducted on using MBR for water treatment [152,
198,199].
Membrane bio-reactor technology combines
the biological degradation process by activated
sludge with a direct solid-liquid separation by
membrane filtration. By using micro or ultra fil-
tration membrane technology (with pore sizes
ranging from 0.05 to 0.4 μm), MBR systems al-
low the complete physical retention of bacterial
flocs and virtually all suspended solids within the
bioreactor. As a result, the MBR has many ad-
vantages over conventional wastewater treatment
processes. These include small footprint and re-
actor requirements, high effluent quality, good
disinfection and odor control capability, higher
volumetric loading and less sludge production
[200–203].
As a result, the MBR process has now become
an attractive option for the treatment and reuse of
industrial, domestic and municipal wastewaters,
as evidenced by their constantly rising numbers
and capacity. There are more than 2200 MBR in-
stallations in operation or under construction
worldwide. In North America, 258 full-scale MBR
plants have been constructed, where 39 of them
are for industrial waste water treatment and 7 of
them have been constructed for industrial chemi-
cal wastewater treatment [204]. The current MBR
market has been estimated to value around
US$216 million and to rise to US$363 million by
2010 [205].
Wastewater in petrochemical industry is cur-
rently treated by activated sludge process with
pretreatment of oil/water separation. Tightening
effluent regulations and increasing need for reuse
of treated water have generated interest in the
treatment of petrochemical wastewater with the
advanced MBR process.
Qin and co-workers [206] used a bench scale
submerged membrane bioreactor system with an

229
anoxic/aerobic concept and flat sheet microfil-
tration membranes to study the treatment and re-
use of a petrochemical wastewater sample. In this
system, chlorinated polyethylene with pore size
0.4 μm was used as membrane. Typical quality of
feed and MBR product water is shown in Table 16.
As it can be seen from the results, the quality of
MBR product met the requirement for discharge.
Kim and co-workers [207] used a dynamic
state membrane bio-reactor with modified inter-
mittent aeration (MIA) for treating sewage. In this
mode of aeration, aeration period is divided into
non-aeration, aeration and non-aeration (NAN).
The performance of the MBR is represented in
Table 17.
Tam and co-workers [208] used a membrane
bio-reactor/reverse osmosis (MBR/RO) and mic-
rofiltration/reverse osmosis (MF/RO) system for
reclamation and reuse of wastewater. A schematic
of these two systems is given in Fig. 10. As it can
be seen, in MBR/RO operation, there is no need
to use “primary treatment” and “secondary treat-
ment” and this is an advantage of MBR/RO sys-
tem. The performance of these two systems is rep-
resented in Table 18.
Wisniewski [201] compares the performance
of MBR system with other conventional processes
(Table 19). As it can be seen, among all presented
processes, a MBR system has the best perfor-
mance in water treatment.
Qin and co-workers [209] investigate waste-
water treatment in a membrane bioreactor pilot
plant. This plant consists of anoxic reaction – aero-
bic reaction – membrane filtration with two sub-
merged PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) hollow
fiber modules. The typical analysis on raw feed
and treated water are summarized in Table 20. For
comparison, industrial water quality is also given
in this table. As it is obvious, the treated water
from this process would be suitable for industrial
use.
5. Water and wastewater treatment
The development of new-generation mem-
branes that can tolerate wide pH ranges, higher
temperatures and harsh chemical environments
and that have improved water flux and solute re-
jection characteristics has resulted in many appli-
cations for the reverse osmosis (RO) process. In
addition to the traditional seawater and brackish
water desalination processes, reverse osmosis
membranes have found applications in wastewa-
ter treatment, production of ultra pure water, wa-
ter softening, food processing and many other
applications.
Membrane processes have several advantages
over many of the traditional separation techniques
such as distillation, extraction, ion exchange and
adsorption. No energy-intensive phase changes or
potentially expensive solvents or adsorbents are
needed for membrane separations, and simulta-
neous separation and concentration of both inor-
ganic and organic compounds is possible with the
RO process. Also, the RO process is inherently
simple to design and operate in comparison with
many traditional separation processes [17].
The desalination of seawater and brackish
water to produce potable water is the most ma-
ture application of the RO process; this process
has been used successfully over the last two de-
cades in virtually every part of the world. Com-
peting desalination processes include multistage
flash (MSF) evaporation, vapor compression
(VC), multi effect distillation (MED), solar evapo-
ration, freezing processes and electrodialysis pro-
cesses (Table 21).

ease of construction, operation and maintenance
232

due to the modular nature of the process, and short
construction times [22]. Use of RO in water de-
salination industry is now increasing and taking
large fraction compared to distillation.
The MSF process accounts for the second larg-
est installed desalting capacity in the world. The
major users of MSF are Saudi Arabia, United Arab
Emirates and Kuwait. The unit costs declined over
time, from about 9 $/m3 in 1960 to about 0.9 $/m3
in 2000. Since MSF is mostly used for seawater
desalination plants, the costs reflect the value of
desalting seawater. The trend indicates that the
desalting costs of seawater are expected to de-
crease further in the future. At present, RO has
the largest share of the total installed capacity in
the world. The operating cost of RO plants has
been reduced thanks to two developments: (1)
lower-cost, higher-flux, higher salt-rejecting
membranes that can operate efficiently at lower
pressures and (2) the use of pressure recovery
devices. Compared to the costs of MSF, costs for
RO have been much lower [210].
Saudi Arabia is an important market for de-
salination plants because of its large-scale desali-
nation activity. Saudi Arabia adopts MSF, and to
a less degree RO. The cost of capital is the most
important determinant of desalination cost in
Saudi Arabia. Table 22 lists past and recent aver-
age unit costs of producing desalinated water in
Saudi Arabia for both MSF and RO plants as com-
pared to world cost estimates [211].
Tables 23 and 24 give capacity for some of
the world’s largest desalination plants for seawa-
ter and brackish water respectively.

Reverse osmosis has also been used to treat
many process streams in the petroleum industry.
Because many of the separations performed in the
petroleum industry involve chemicals that dam-
age or degrade membranes, RO has been used
almost exclusively to treat wastewaters. The com-
position of wastewaters generated by the petro-
leum industry is almost as diverse as the range of
products produced. In the past, many of these
wastewaters have been treated using biological
processes (e.g. activated sludge). However, these
wastewaters contain components that can inhibit
the action of the organisms in the sludge, render-
ing the process ineffective. An alternative treat-
ment technique, air flotation, also has limitations.
Air flotation is used to remove most of the sus-
pended or “free” oils from wastewaters, but it
cannot be used to remove water-soluble low mo-
lecular weight organics. In some cases, the con-
centration of oils in the treated wastewater remains
too high to allow discharge into the environment.
As a result, other treatment options are employed,
such as solvent extraction, wet oxidation, carbon
adsorption, and RO.

RO-based systems for the recovery of oily
wastewaters are now on the market or in the pilot
plant stage. However, extensive pretreatment is
often required to maintain high performance be-
cause of the composition of the wastewater. De-
spite the need for these complicated pretreatment
trains, RO is still considered a viable treatment
method for oily wastewaters produced by the pe-
troleum industry and for oily wastewaters pro-
duced by many other industries.
6. Summary
In the mid decades of the 20th century, indus-
trial world understood that they should not rely
solely on crude oil as an energy source; and solar

better substitution with the current energy sources.
Therefore, non-petroleum sources became gradu-
ally important and processes such as OCM and
GTL (gas to liquid), which are based upon using
natural gas in order to produce fuels, are being
developed.
A decrease in petroleum sources and a great
fluctuation in their prices are the principal moti-
vations that in near future, non-petroleum sources
be used for the production of petrochemical ma-
terials as the feed of petrochemical plants.
In the case of separation operations, currently
available methods are easy and reliable but they
are expensive, energy-intensive and environmen-
tal pollutants.

als, there has been resurgence in interest in mem-
brane based processes. Continual efforts to de-
velop economical and efficient membranes for
various end uses have resulted in a variety of ap-
plication oriented membranes.
It is clear that in near future, membranes will
have an outstanding role in separation industries.
Membranes work with very low energies, do not
need any heating-cooling systems and do not have
any environmental pollution. There is one discuss-
able point in developing these systems and that
would be their long term stability in industrial
operations.
Production of polyolefins is important in pet-
rochemical industry. An important step in the
manufacture of olefins is large scale separation
of olefin from the corresponding paraffin. Nowa-
days, this operation is carried out by distillation,
which is highly energy-intensive due to cryogenic
temperatures required for the process and low rela-
tive volatilities of component. Due to several ad-
vantages of membrane processes, researchers ex-
amined various membrane systems by which rea-
sonable results were obtained in laboratory scale.
Based upon large capital expense and energy cost
of industrial distillation columns, it seems wor-
thy to recommend membrane processes as a sub-
stitution with distillation columns in industrial ap-
plications. Of course, maintaining the system sta-
bility for long term operations is still question-
able.
In petrochemical industry, reaction and sepa-
ration play an important role in achieving desir-
able products. Using a membrane reactor, these
two parameters can be controlled simultaneously.
Dehydrogenation, oxidative coupling of methane,
steam reforming of methane and water gas shift
reaction are important reactions in petrochemical
industry. The application of different membrane
reactors to these reactions was investigated and
valuable experimental results were obtained as
well. In this case, it also seems attractive to con-
sider membrane reactor in industrial applications.
However, parameters such as ‘long term reliabil-
ity with catalyst life’, ‘high temperature resistance’
and ‘low coke formation’ should be considered
in applying membrane reactors in industrial cases.
In case of the application of nanotechnology
in the production of gas separation membranes,
nano composite membranes can simultaneously
improve permeability and selectivity. Producing
these membranes in industrial scales, in future,
refineries and petrochemical complexes will be
free from huge energy-intensive distillation col-
umns, and membrane modules can easily be re-
placed.
Petrochemical waste streams may contain phe-
nolic compounds or aromatic amines. They are
highly toxic and at high concentrations are inhibi-
tory to biological treatment. Membrane aromatic
recovery system (MARS) is a relatively new pro-
cess for recovery of aromatic acids and bases.
Wastewater in petrochemical industry is cur-
rently treated by activated sludge process with
pretreatment of oil/water separation. Tightening
effluent regulations and increasing need for reuse
of treated water have generated interest in the
treatment of petrochemical wastewater with the
advanced membrane bioreactor (MBR) process.
It can be predicted that up to 2020, investments
in the production of gas separation membranes
will greatly increase.
7. General definitions
Based upon IUPAC terminology for membrane
and membrane processes, there are some general
definitions as below [90,91]:
Damkohler number — Dimensionless number
equal to the characteristic time (l2/DAM) for dif-
fusion of complexed component across a mem-
brane thickness, l, divided by the characteris-
tic time (kd
–1) for the decomplexation reaction
between a carrier (M) and a complexed pen-
etrant, A, ie l2/(DAMkd) where DAM is the effec-
tive diffusion coefficient of the complexed
carrier entity in the membrane.
M. Takht Ravanchi et al. / Desalination 235 (2009) 199–244
235
Enhancement factor, ε — Ratio of the flux of a
component across a carrier-containing mem-
brane divided by the transmembrane flux of
the same component across an otherwise iden-
tical membrane without carrier.
Facilitation factor, F — Parameter equal to the
enhancement factor minus one, i.e. F = ε –1
Ideal separation factor — Parameter defined as
the ratio of the permeability coefficient of com-
ponent A in a membrane to that of component
B in the membrane.
Permeability (cm3(STP) cm/cm2s cm Hg, Barrer
[1 Barrer = 10-–10(cm3(STP) cm)/cm2 s cmHg)]
— Rate of flow of gas through a membrane of
1cm thickness with a cross-sectional area of
1 cm2 and a transmembrane differential pres-
sure of 1 cm Hg.
Permeance (cm3(STP)/cm2 s cm Hg, GPU (1 GPU
= 10–6 cm3(STP)/cm2 s cm Hg)) — Transport
flux per unit transmembrane driving force.
Permeate — Stream containing penetrants that
leaves a membrane module.
Retentate (raffinate) — Stream that has been de-
pleted of penetrants that leaves the membrane
modules without passing through the mem-
brane to the downstream.
Separation factor — The ability of membrane to
separate gases, which is defined as αij =  (yi/yj)/
(xi/zj), where yi, xi and yj, xj refer to the mole
fraction of components i and j in the product
and feed streams respectively.
Sweep — Nonpermeating stream directed past the
downstream membrane face to reduce down-
stream permeant concentration.
