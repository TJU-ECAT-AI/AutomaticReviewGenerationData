The dehydrogenation 
of propane and the hydrogenat,ion of propylene were kinetically 
investigated 
over chromia-alumina-potassium 
oxide catalysts. The reactions were carried 
out in conventional closed static reactor at temperatures ranging from 443 to 505’C. The rmls 
were performed on propane, propane + propylene, propane + hydrogen and propylene + 
hydrogen. The rates were obtained from the initial slope of the pressure-t,ime curves. The 
lea&on 
rate data were described satisfactorily with the rate equation such as 
r = (&IKIPc~H~

INTRODUCTION 
Catalytic 
reactions 
involving 
dehydro- 
genation, hydrogenation, 
cracking and iso- 
merization 
are important 
processes in the 
petrochemical 
industry. 
Among these the 
dehydrogenation 
of butane over chromia- 
alumina 
catalysts 
is one of the most im- 
portant processes for obt’aining butenes and 
butadine. 
Besides 
being 
of 
commercial 
interest, 
both dehydrogenation 
and hydro- 
genation 
of Ck hydrocarbons 
occur in a 
temperature 
range convenient 
for kinetic 
investigation. 
Both 
reactions 
have 
been 
extensively 
investigated 
from 
industrial 
and scientific points of view. 
Dodd and Watson 
(1) made a pioneer 
study of butane and butene dehydrogena- 
tion over chromia-alumina 
catalyst. 
They 
set the pattern 
for much of the later work 
of the catalytic 
dehydrogenation 
of hydro- 
carbons. The kinetic data were treated by 
the rate equations 
developed 
by Hougen 
and Watson 
(,2), and indicated 
the dual- 
site mechanism. In contrast with the results 
of Dodd 
and Watson 
(I), 
Balandin 
(3) 
described 
the rates of a large body 
of 
catalytic 
dehydrogenation 
using a single- 
site mechanism. 
Carra et al. (4) described 
butane 
dehydrogenation 
over 
chromia- 
alumina, 
catalysts 
with 
allowance 
of the 
reversibility 
of the reaction 
and proposed 
a dual-site 
mechanism. 
Happel 
et al. (5) 
indicated 
that neither the dual-site mecha- 
nism nor the single-site mechanism was able 
to afford satisfactory 
description 
for butane 
dehydrogenation 
over 
chromia-alumina 
catalyst. 
Thereafter, 
they 
(6) determined 
both the forward 
and the reverse reaction 
rates in butane 
dehydrogenation 
with 
a 
mixture 
of ?l-butane, I-butene 
and hydro- 
gen in which one of the hydrocarbons 
was 
radioactively 
tagged. 
The study of the reaction rate occurring 
in the dehydrogenation 
of butane involves 
many difficulties 
associated wit,h the com- 
plexity 
of the system such as the formation 
of the butene isomers and the isomeriza- 
tion of the isomers. In this investigation,

we performed a study of the kinetics of Ca 
hydrocarbons because both the dehydro- 
genation and the hydrogenation 
of Cs 
hydrocarbons occur in conventional tem- 
perature ranges and no isomers were formed 
in the reaction. 
In this paper, we describe the mechanism 
of the dehydrogenation 
of propane over 
chromia-alumina-potassium 
oxide in some 
detail. The approach adopted was to set 
down logically many of the possible ele- 
mentary steps and to derive rate equations 
to show that the experimental results con- 
form to such a reaction mechanism. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
METHODS 
Catalyst 
Alumina was used as a carrier and was 
prepared from alumina sol (Alumina Sol 
200: Nissan Chemical Co. Ltd.) as follows. 
The alumina sol was dried to alumina gel 
over a water bath, then dried in a drying 
furnace overnight at 110°C. Then, the gel 
was crushed, sieved and sizes 
between 16-32 
mesh were separated. The alumina gel was 
immersed in calculated amounts of mixed 
aqueous solutions of chromic nitrate 
at 
70°C for 3 hr. The water was evaporated 
and calcined at 600°C. The weight percent 
of Crz03 and I&O and the BET surface 
areas determined by adsorption of nitrogen 
are summarized in Table 1. The catalyst 
thus obtained was calcined under vacuum 
at 500°C for 2 hr and heated under 200 Torr 
of hydrogen for a certain number of hours 
at the same 
temperature. Then, the ca.talyst 
was calcined under vacuum at 500°C for 
2 hr and used for the first run. The sub- 
sequent runs were performed after 2-hr 
evacuation at reaction temperature after 
the former runs. 
Reactants 
Hydrogen was supplied from Takachiho 
Chem. Ind. 
Co. Ltd. 
and purified 
by 
passage through copper powder heated at 
400°C and through a liquid nitrogen trap. 
Propane and propylene were supplied from 
Takachiho Chem. Ind. Co. Ltd. and puri- 
fied by repeated distillations. 
No impurities 
were detected by gas- 
solid chromatography (GSC) analyses. 
Gas Analyses 
Analyses of hydrocarbons 
were per- 
formed by GSC with a 60-cm column of 
silica gel at 60°C. Helium was used as a 
carrier gas and its flow rate was about 40 
ml/min. 
Apparatus 
The apparatus consists of 3OOO:ml 
Pyrex 
bulb equipped with a cavity 
for catalyst

bed, a preheater, an oil manometer and a 
gas handling 
device for GSC. The bulb, 
except for the cavity, was surrounded with 
a metal jacket filled with water maintained 
at a constant temperature as described 
previously (7). 
RESULTS 
AND DISCUSSION 
Preliminary 
Run 
No products other than propylene and 
hydrogen were detected by gas chromato- 
graphic analyses in the initialstage at 443°C. 
Formation of methane and ethane (crack- 
ing), 
however, was observed with 
gas 
chromatographic analyses as the reaction 
proceeded and the propylene formed. Initial 
rate, therefore, was estimated from the 
initial slope of the pressure-time curve as 
described previously (7). The initial pres- 
sure of propane was obtained from a 
graphical extrapolation to zero time on the 
pressure-time curve. The initial dehydro- 
genation rates changed with increasing 
potassium content of the Cr203-A120rKz0 
catalysts and are tabulated in Table 1. 
Table 1 shows that No. 4 Crz03-A1203- 
KzO catalyst is the most active of our 
catalysts and No. 4 catalyst was used in 
the following runs. The rate of dehydro- 
genation of propane changed also with the 
time of the hydrogen treatment. The maxi- 
mum activity in the dehydrogenation was

obtained with 
1-hr hydrogen treatment 
when the catalyst was heated under 200 
Torr of hydrogen at 500°C. The color of 
the catalyst changed to deep green from 
deep brown with the hydrogen treatment. 
The BET surface area determined with 
nitrogen 
adsorption 
at liquid 
nitrogen 
temperature did not change. The change in 
the activity 
of the dehydrogenation may, 
therefore, be attributed 
to the change in 
the oxidation state of the chromium. In the 
following experiments, we used as catalyst 
No. 4 Crz03-A120rK20 
catalyst which 
was treated with 200 Torr of hydrogen for 
1 hr at 500°C. 
Dehydrogenation 
of Propane 
The catalytic activity 
decreased grad- 
ually with every run and reached a settled 
one. The settled initial rates of dehydro- 
genation of propane thus obtained were 
plotted 
against the initial 
pressures of 
propane as shown in Fig. 1. This behavior 
can be expressed with the Langmuir-type 
kinetic equation such as 
k,K&xHs’ 
FoO = 
1 + 
&PC3H~“’ 
(1) 
where kl and KI are constants, ?$ and 
Pc~H~O are initial rate of the dehydrogena- 
tion and the initial 
pressure of propane, 
respectively. Equation (1) can be written 
as follows : 
(pW,“/i’oo) 
= (VWG) 
+ (l/h)PCsHs”.

the

Reaction Mechanism and Rate Equation 
Twenty-two 
possible reaction paths were 
considered 
which 
were constituted 
from 
several elementary 
reaction steps. In these 
reaction 
paths, 
we have 
considered 
an 
associative mechanism, dissociative 
mecha- 
nism, Langmuir-Hinshelwood 
mechanism, 
Eley-Rideal 
mechanism, single-site mecha- 
nsim and dual-site 
mechanism 
(8). Rate 
equations can be derived on condition 
that 
one of the elementary 
steps is the rate 
determining 
one in each reaction 
path. 
One hundred and three of the possible rate 
equations 
were 
derived 
from 
103 cor- 
responding 
mechanisms. 
Ninty-three 
of 
these rate equations could not interpret 
the 
dependency 
of the initial 
rate of the de- 
hydrogenation 
on the initial 
propane pres- 
sure described 
in Eq. 
(l), 
and these 93 
rate equations 
were eliminated. 
The de- 
pendency 
of the initial 
rate on the initial 
pressure 
[Eq. 
(l)] 
seemingly 
could 
be 
interpreted 
with the other 10 rate equations 
described below.

Dehydrogenation 
of Propane in the Presence

The dehydrogenations 
of propane in the 
presence of hydrogen 
were performed over 
the Cr~03--AleO~-KzO catalyst at 443°C. In 
these runs, the initial 
pressures of hydrogen 
were varied 
and the initial 
pressures of 
propane were kept constant 
(21.0 Torr).

according to the first, second and the third 
rows of Table 3 are shown in Figs. 4, 5 and

lyst, at 443°C. The formation 
of methane 
and ethane (cracking) 
was observed with 
GSC analysis and the rate of cracking was 
obtained. The initial 
rate of hydrogenation 
of propylene 
was, therefore, 
obtained 
by 
calculation 
from the difference between the 
initial 
slope of the pressure-time 
curve and 
the initial 
rate of cracking. 
The initial 
rates thus obtained 
at constant 
pressures 
of propylene 
(15.5 Torr) 
were plotted 
against the initial 
pressures of hydrogen as 
shown in Fig. 7. The Langmuir 
plot of the 
experimental 
data is shown in Fig. S and 
t,he rate was, therefore, expressed as 
kzKzP&’ 
;;(jJ

where kz and K, are constants and PH$ is 
the initial 
pressure of hydrogen. 
The initial 
rates obtained 
at constant 
initial 
pressures of hydrogen 
(S.S Torr) 
were plotted 
against the initial 
pressures 
of propylene 
(Fig. 9). The initial 
rate was, 
therefore, expressed as 
To0 = 
Ic~K~‘c~H&’ 
1 + KsPc&” 
(G) 
where lis and KS are constants and Pc~H~O 
is the initial 
pressure of propylene. 
These initial 
rate Eqs. (3) and (G) can be 
derived from the rate equation

on

SUZUKI 
AND KANEKO 
condition 
that 
the initial 
pressure of 
propane is zero and the initial pressure of

respectively. The constants kz, Kt, k3, and

kz = iEI1

The adsorption equilibrium 
constants ob- 
tained from Figs. 8 and 9 are tabulated in 
Table 2. The adsorption equilibrium 
con- 
stants K1 = KI, Kz = KIV and Kz = KIII 
obtained independently from the dehydro- 
genation of propane or the hydrogenation 
of propylene agree within 
experimental 
error as shown in Table 2. This agreement 
shows that the dehydrogenation of propane 
over the Crz03-A120r&O 
catalyst pro- 
ceeds in reaction path E and the second 
step (II) of the path is the rate determining 
one. 
The reaction mechanism proposed in- 
volves the adsorption of hydrogen molecule 
but not hydrogen atom. This mechanism 
may agree with the experimental results 
obtained by Burwell et al. (9) that the 
deuteration of cis- and trans-Zbutene over 
chromium oxide gel produced meso- and 
dl-butane-2,3-c&, respectively.
