Abstract
Mechanistic and kinetic information on the ethane dehydrogenation reaction over a semicommercial Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst has been elucidated from catalytic testing and isotopic labeling experiments under reaction conditions close to those used in the commercial dehydrogenation process (C2H6/H2/H2O/inert = 10/1.5/2/32 or C2H6/H2/CO2/inert = 10/2/5/83, 600−630 °C reaction temperature, atmospheric pressure). From kinetic measurements, a negative dependence of the reaction rate in H2 and C2H4 partial pressures was observed, while the dependence on steam partial pressure was positive. Isotopic labeling experiments showed that the negative effect of H2 and C2H4 could not be attributed to the reverse reaction, but rather to competitive adsorption at the active sites for dehydrogenation. The observed reaction rate with respect to C2H6 was close to first order. By fitting the experimental data to the rate equation derived from the elementary steps of ethane dehydrogenation, the observed deviation from the first order could be explained by partial occupation of the surface by adsorbed surface species. Methane and ethyne were the main byproducts of the dehydrogenation reaction. Cofeed experiments with 13C12CH6/12C2H4 indicated that both methane and ethyne are produced via ethene, and not directly from ethane. D2/C2H6 cofeeding experiments revealed further that one H at the time is replaced with D in ethene, that addition of CO2 does not affect the H−D distribution in ethene and ethyne and that practically no H−D exchange takes place over the support. The activation energy of the dehydrogenation of ethane over the present catalyst has in a previous study been determined to 116 kJ/mol [Virnovskaia, A.; Morandi, S.; Rytter, E.; Ghiotti, G.; Olsbye, U. Characterization of Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O Catalysts for Light Alkane Dehydrogenation by FT-IR Spectroscopy and Catalytic Measurements. J. Phys. Chem. C2007, 111, 14732]. The apparent activation energy for ethene hydrogenation over the same catalyst could be determined to −40 kJ/mol in the temperature range 497−596 °C, indicating that in this temperature range the decrease in surface coverage with temperature overcompensates the increase of the rate constant of the rate determining step of the hydrogenation reaction.

1 Introduction
Ethene is the largest base chemical for the chemical industry. (1) Ethene and other light alkenes are produced either by cracking or by dehydrogenation of light alkanes. (2) Recently a new process for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane or a mixture of propane and butanes was developed. (3) The process uses a highly efficient Pt−Sn catalyst impregnated on calcined hydrotalcite. The Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst has improved activity, selectivity, and stability compared to conventional Pt,Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. (4) Contrary to the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, the Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst shows tolerance toward water, which makes it suitable for dehydrogenation under oxidative (with addition of O2) and mildly oxidative (with addition of H2O or CO2) conditions. Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is strongly endothermic and limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. In situ removal of hydrogen by addition of an oxidative agent to the dehydrogenation feed would shift the equilibrium to the product side. Addition of O2 or CO2 has been investigated for this purpose by several authors. (5-12) The dehydrogenation process with Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst utilizes steam as a diluent, to improve the heat balance in the system and to avoid coking of the catalyst.
Kinetic and mechanistic insight in dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as ethane, propane, isobutane, and hydrogenation of their respective alkenes is a topic of many publications, see, for example, refs 13−24 and references therein. Most of the studies are, however, limited to the main products only, and side reactions are not taken into account. Additionally, many dehydrogenation and especially hydrogenation studies are performed at low temperatures and at low total and reactant pressures.
In this paper we summarize kinetic and mechanistic results of ethane dehydrogenation over a semicommercial Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst. The obtained results have been utilized to elucidate mechanistic information on the ethane dehydrogenation reaction over the Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst, with emphasis on the side products and side reactions under mildly oxidative conditions (i.e., with CO2 or H2O added to the feed) and under reaction conditions close to those used in the dehydrogenation process for which the above-mentioned catalyst has been developed.
The present work is a continuation of previous studies in which we have found that the semicommercial Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst used here, consists of a pure (nonsegregated) Mg(Al)O phase, (-25, 26) in which Mg and Al are homogeneously distributed. Further, while a Pt/Mg(Al)O catalyst contained both low-coordinated (steps, edges, corners, or defects) Pt sites and Pt terrace sites, in Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst the low-coordinated Pt sites were found to be covered by Sn. This means that the accessible Pt sites in the semicommercial Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O consist mainly of terraces. (26) However, some Pt sites were found to be influenced by the support. From in situ XPS studies of model Pt/Mg(Al)O and Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts and a PtSn2 alloy, it was found that under reaction conditions, part of Sn was in an oxidized state, while part of Sn formed Pt−Sn alloy with Pt. Pt was found in a reduced state and alloyed with Sn. (25)
2 Experimental Details
2.1 Catalyst Samples
A semicommercial Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst [Statoil C440−139] was used in the present study. The metal content of the catalyst was 0.5 wt % Pt and 1.2 wt % Sn, the Mg/Al molar ratio of the support was 4.8. The catalyst was received as pellets, which were crushed and sieved to obtain appropriate particle size for the catalytic testing and isotopic labeling experiments.
A hydrotalcite carrier material with a Mg/Al molar ratio of 4.8, prepared using standard coprecipitation method (27) was used as a reference. Before testing, the hydrotalcite carrier material powder was calcined at 800 °C for 5 h in air, pressed to pellets (5 tons), then crushed and sieved to obtain particle size in the range 0.125−0.25 mm.
2.2 Catalytic Testing
Catalytic tests were carried out in a tubular fixed-bed quartz reactor with inner diameter 7 mm. The temperature in the catalyst bed was measured by a thermocouple contained in a quartz thermocouple well (outer diameter 3 mm) which was centered axially inside the reactor. Prior to testing, the catalyst (4 mg, 0.25−0.42 mm particle size, diluted with 16 mg quartz particles with the same particle size) was heated to 600 °C in N2 stream and activated before being exposed to the reaction mixture (normally consisting of 54% Ar, 22% C2H6, 16% N2, 5% H2O (g) and 3% H2, totally 616 mL/min). The catalyst was activated in situ by two cycles consisting of a 30 min reduction at 600 °C, a 2 h ethane dehydrogenation at 625 °C, and a 4 h regeneration at 600 °C by air diluted with nitrogen and argon. During regeneration, the oxygen content was initially 2 mol% and was increased in four steps up to 21 mol% (100% air) at 60 min intervals. All catalytic tests were performed on fully activated catalyst, at atmospheric total pressure, and at an average catalyst bed temperature of 625−631 °C. The experiments were performed under differential conditions with ethane conversion in the range 0.1−4%. Ethane conversion was calculated on the basis of the C1 amount in the detected products. The experiments were performed in the kinetic region. No transport limitations was ascertained by temperature variation experiments, which showed linear Arrhenius plots and gave an apparent activation energy for ethane dehydrogenation of 116 kJ/mol, (26) well in line with apparent activation energies reported in literature. (21) The mass balance accuracy was within 5%.
The partial pressure of ethane, ethene, hydrogen, and steam was varied in the following ranges: 0.06−0.22 bar ethane, 0−0.06 bar ethene, 0−0.08 bar hydrogen and 0−0.7 bar steam. When the partial pressure of reactants was varied, the total flow was kept constant by adjusting the inert flow. During testing, progressive catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition was observed. To compensate for catalyst deactivation during the experiments with temperature or partial pressure variation, the conversion under reference conditions (54% Ar, 22% C2H6, 16% N2, 5% H2O (g), 3% H2, totally 616 mL/min flow) was measured before and after each temperature or pressure variation. The use of this so-called “bracketing” technique to minimize the effects of activity variations in the analysis of the kinetic data has been described by Yates et al. in ref 28. The effect of a kinetic variable such as, for instance, hydrogen or ethane partial pressure was then determined by comparing the rate at a given set of conditions with the average of the rates immediately before and after the period in question. For each set of conditions the rate r relative to the rate r0 at the standard conditions can be expressed by the ratio r/r0, which should be reasonably independent of moderate variations in catalytic activity; r/r0 = 1 by definition at the standard conditions.
The composition of the feed was controlled using Bronkhorst Hi-Tec mass flow controllers. The reactor effluent was analyzed by using an online HP Quad Micro-GC with three separate channels containing Molsieve-5Å, PoraPlot-U, and AluminaPlot columns, respectively, and thermal conductivity detectors. All transfer lines located down stream of the reactor were kept above 100 °C to prevent condensation of water.
Gas phase reactions were studied in the reactor filled with 20 mg of quartz particles of 0.25−0.42 mm particle size under standard flow (vide ultra). Only very low gas phase ethane conversions were observed at temperatures below 650 °C (0.04% and 0.2% at 600 and 650 °C, respectively), whereas above 650 °C, gas phase ethane conversions increased to 0.7% and 1.7% at 675 and 700 °C, respectively.
2.3 Isotopic Labeling Experiments
Isotopic labeling experiments were performed on fully activated catalyst. Prior to deuterium labeling experiments the catalyst was reduced in D2 during the last activation cycle to avoid traces of H2 in the system. Five mg of catalyst (0.125−0.25 mm) was diluted with 20 mg quartz particles of the same particle size. The feed normally consisted of 2% H2 or D2, 5% CO2, 10% C2H6, and 83% inert (10% argon in helium or 7% nitrogen + 93% argon), totally 125 mL/min. All the isotopic labeling experiments were performed at atmospheric total pressure with 598 °C as a standard temperature. The experiments were performed under differential conditions with ethane conversion in the range 1−6%.
Partial pressure of ethene and deuterium was varied in the ranges: 0−0.03 bar ethene, and 0−0.04 bar deuterium. When the partial pressure of reactants was varied, the total flow was kept constant by adjusting the inert flow. To compensate for catalyst deactivation during partial pressure variation experiments, the conversion at reference conditions (2% H2 or D2, 5% CO2, 10% C2H6, 83% inert) was measured before and after each pressure variation. An example of such a test sequence is shown in Figure 1 for D2 partial pressure variation. The data treatment of the experiments performed in this way has been described in section 2.2.
Figure 1
Figure 1. Example of a pressure variation experiment. Variation of D2 partial pressure at 597−599 °C. Feed compositions: C2H6/D2/CO2/inert = 10/1.7/6.7/83 or 10/3.4/6.4/77 or 10/0.6/6.9/84, WHSV (based on ethane) = 20 h−1 for all compositions.
The composition of the feed was controlled using Brooks mass flow controllers. D2 gas (99.8% isotopic purity) was obtained from Linde Gas AG. Monolabeled ethane (1-13C, isotopic purity 99%) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. The reactor effluent was analyzed by using an online HP Quad Micro-GC (see section 2.2). The isotopic composition of each component was determined by using an off-line HP 6890 GC with a GS GasPro column and a HP 5973 mass selective detector. During the 13C isotopic labeling experiments the reactor effluent was continuously monitored by using an online Pfeiffer Omnistar mass spectrometer.
Prior to 13C isotopic labeling experiments it was necessary to flush the reactor system with ethane-free feed to avoid contamination with unlabeled ethane. Before addition of the 13C12CH6/12C2H4 mixture, the system was flushed with feed consisting of 2% H2, 5% CO2, and 93% inert (7% nitrogen + 93% argon), totally 115 mL/min until the absence of hydrocarbons in the effluent was confirmed by the mass spectrometer signal (approximately 5 min). It was observed that the catalytic activity was unchanged after the period with the feed consisting of H2, CO2, and inert, and the deactivation profile was conserved. On the contrary, a period of flushing with inert only led to a higher activity and steeper deactivation profile when the dehydrogenation feed was fed over the catalyst after flushing. In this case the evaluation of the deactivation was based on a visual examination of the observed activity profiles.
Gas phase reactions were studied using 20 mg of quartz particles (0.125−0.25 mm) in the reactor. Only very low gas phase ethane conversions were observed in the temperature range 550−650 °C (0%, 0.01%, and 0.3% ethane conversions at 550, 600, and 650 °C, respectively, under the feed conditions described above). When space velocity was decreased four times, gas phase ethane conversion increased to 0.06% at 600 °C.
2.4 Ethene Hydrogenation
Ethene hydrogenation measurements were performed on fully activated catalyst, at atmospheric total pressure in the temperature range 395−645 °C with 596 °C as a reference temperature. Five mg of catalyst (0.125−0.25 mm) diluted with 20 mg quartz particles of the same particle size was used. To compensate for catalyst deactivation when varying the temperature, the conversion at reference conditions was measured before and after each temperature variation. The data treatment of the experiments performed in this way has been described in section 2.2. The feed normally consisted of 8% H2, 5% CO2, 10% C2H4 and 77% inert (8% nitrogen + 92% argon), totally 125 mL/min. The experiments were performed under differential conditions with ethene conversion in the range 1−3%.
2.5 Isotopic Labeling Data Treatment
Simulated mass fragmentation spectra were calculated not taking into account kinetic isotope effect. Further, natural occurrence of 1% 13C in carbon was neglected. This is a common approximation in calculation of isotopomer distributions. (29) The uncertainty in our isotopomer distribution measurements in H−D exchange experiments was approximated from comparison of mass fragmentation spectra of CH4 and CD4, which showed that the probability of loosing one D was 0.9 times the probability of loosing one H. Because of the approximations mentioned above, the uncertainty in the simulated H−D mass fragmentation spectra was estimated to be within 20% relative. No kinetic isotope effect was expected in 13C labeling experiments. The uncertainty of the isotope simulations was in this case estimated from the root-mean-square error (rmse) of the fit of the simulated mass fragmentation spectra. The rmse values obtained were below 1% for ethane, ethene, and ethyne, and below 2% for methane. The agreement between measured and calculated mass fragmentation spectra was found satisfactory.
3 Results
3.1 Catalytic Tests
3.1.1 Variation of Partial Pressure of Reactants and Products
The partial pressure of ethane, ethene, hydrogen, and water were varied to elucidate the influence of the reactants and products partial pressure on the reaction rate. Ethane conversion during partial pressure variation experiments is shown in Figure 2. Under the test conditions the selectivity to ethene was above 99%; CH4, CO2, and CO were the observed byproducts. The ethane conversion shows only a weak dependence on ethane partial pressure, which indicates a close to first-order dependence of reaction rate on the partial pressure of ethane (the calculated reaction order with respect to ethane was 0.95). Further, a negative dependence on hydrogen partial pressure at higher hydrogen concentrations is observed, as well as a positive dependence on hydrogen addition at low hydrogen concentrations. The dependence on ethene partial pressure is negative. Water addition shows positive effect on the reaction rate, the positive effect being strongest at lower steam partial pressures.

Ethane conversion during partial pressure variation of reactants and products: (a) (○) H2O, conversion range 0.8−1.8%, (⧫) C2H6, conversion range 1.5−2.5%; (b) (●) H2, conversion range 0.5−4%, (◊) C2H4, conversion range 0−2.5%. All conversions are corrected for deactivation through normalization relative to standard conditions (As described in section 2.2). Solid lines represent conversions calculated using rate eq 8 presented in section 4.2.
Hydrogen addition has a strong effect on the deactivation rate (see also section 3.1.2). The observed positive dependence of the ethane conversion on hydrogen addition at low hydrogen partial pressures may therefore be attributed to the high deactivation rate at low hydrogen partial pressures (based on visual inspection of the observed activity profiles). The negative dependence of the reaction rate on H2 pressure can be approximated by a power equation with a reaction order in H2 pressure of −0.4. This observation, as well as a close to first-order dependence of the reaction rate on ethane partial pressure, is well in agreement with results reported in literature. (18, 20)
3.1.2 Deactivation
Deactivation tests were performed in combination with isotopic labeling experiments, and the test conditions are therefore as described in section 2.3. Ethane conversion was generally in the range 1−6%; however, for comparison of deactivation rate with or without CO2 addition, it was in the range 4−22%. Ethane conversion profiles during tests with different deuterium partial pressures are shown in Figure 3. At higher partial pressures (i.e., above the H2 or D2 partial pressure under standard test conditions of 0.02 bar), D2 addition does not affect the deactivation profile significantly. At lower deuterium partial pressures, the deactivation rate increases with reduced D2 partial pressure. Further, if one returns to a D2/H2-containing feed after a feed without D2/H2, a gradual increase in activity is observed (as can be seen in Figure 3c).

(+) Testing at standard conditions with H2 partial pressure of 0.02 bar before partial pressure variation, (×) testing at standard conditions with H2 partial pressure of 0.02 bar after partial pressure variation, (○) testing at the following H2 partial pressures: (a) 0.04 bar D2, (b) 0.005 bar D2, (c) no deuterium added. All conversions are normalized to one at change of conditions, all time on stream values set to zero at change of conditions.
The amount of steam present in the feed did not have a clear effect on the deactivation rate, whereas absence of steam could have a slight negative effect (not reported). Absence of CO2 in the feed led to a significantly higher initial deactivation rate compared to the feed where CO2 was present, as shown in Figure 4. No significant difference in the deactivation rate was observed during ethane partial pressure variation experiments. Indications of higher deactivation rates with increasing ethene partial pressures were observed (not reported). Without CO2 in the feed, a gradual increase in activity was observed when returning to standard feed conditions after sequences with C2H4 addition.

3.1.3 Ethene Hydrogenation
To further elucidate the possible role of ethene hydrogenation, the reaction was studied separately in the temperature range 395−645 °C with 596 °C as a reference temperature. The ethene conversion was in the range 1−2% at 596 °C. The Arrhenius plot of ln r versus 1/T is shown in Figure 5. The graph is linear in the temperature range 497−596 °C, and in this temperature range the apparent activation energy of ethene hydrogenation was calculated to −40 kJ/mol. At lower temperatures, the Arrhenius plot shows indications of a lower slope (i.e., less negative activation energy). At temperatures above 596 °C the slope is close to zero or even shows indications of a change of direction, giving a possible positive activation energy of ethene hydrogenation at temperatures above 596 °C. The apparent activation energy of ethane dehydrogenation over the present catalyst has previously been determined to 116 kJ/mol in the temperature range 550−650 °C. (26) Only very low (below 0.1%) gas phase ethene conversions were observed in a quartz-filled reactor in the temperature range 400−650 °C.

3.1.4 By-Product Formation
By-product formation studies were performed in combination with isotopic labeling experiments, and the test conditions are therefore as described in section 2.3.
CH4, C2H2, and CO were the only byproducts of ethane dehydrogenation observed in significant amounts at 600 °C. CH4 could be formed either from C−C scission in ethane or ethene, or from hydrogenation of C-species from CO2/CO. To study whether methane formation occurs also from CO2 under the experimental conditions used in this study, an experiment was performed where a mixture of H2, CO2, and inert was fed over the catalyst at two different WHSVs (CO2/H2/N2/Ar = 10:4:13:179 or 10:4:13:17, totally 115 or 24 mL/min). No methane formation could be observed, and CO was the only product detected. CO is probably formed by the reverse water−gas-shift reaction (RWGS; CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O, ΔrG = 6.5 kJ/mol at 600 °C). The relative amounts of CO, H2O, H2, and CO2 were in all experiments close to the equilibrium composition for the RWGS reaction at the same conditions (calculated from the mass balance between feed and effluent concentrations, using N2 as internal standard). For the dehydrogenation experiment with addition of CO2 presented in Table 1 (standard test conditions, 597 °C), calculated equilibrium CO2 conversion and observed CO2 conversion were both 22%.

C2H6, H2, CO2, inert 6.1 98.7 1.1 0.2 Ta
aT = Traces. Although significant CO amount was produced, most of CO was formed from CO2 via the reverse water−gas-shift reaction, and only traces were observed to be formed from ethane conversion. See section 3.1.4 for the details on selectivity calculations.
A comparison of product selectivities with the feeds consisting of C2H6 and inert, C2H6, H2, and inert, and C2H6, CO2, H2 and inert, all at 6% ethane conversion, is shown in Table 1. It should be noted that product selectivities, referring to the C1 amount in each product, are based exclusively on ethane conversion. The formation of CO from CO2 was subtracted from the total CO amount, based on the mass balance. Surprisingly, no methane formation was detected even when C2H6, H2, and inert was fed over the catalyst (see Table 1). It is therefore interesting to observe that methane is formed when both C2H6, H2, and CO2 are present in the feed (as also observed during similar D2 isotopic labeling experiments, see Table 4 and Table 5). Thermodynamically, CH4 is more likely to be formed from ethane or ethene hydrogenolysis (C2H6 + H2 = 2CH4, ΔrG = −71 kJ/mol or C2H4 + 2H2 = 2CH4, ΔrG = −93 kJ/mol at 627 °C), or alternatively from the reaction 2CO + 2H2 → CO2 + CH4 (ΔrG = −5 kJ/mol), than from methanation of COx (CO/CO2 + xH2 → CH4 + yH2O, ΔrG > 0). In any case, the low amount of methane produced strongly indicates that methane formation is slow compared both to the rate of the water−gas-shift reaction and to the rate of the dehydrogenation reaction.
3.2 Isotopic Labeling Experiments
3.2.1 13C-Labeling
An experiment where 13C monolabeled ethane was cofed with unlabeled ethene was performed to study the origin of the byproducts and the extent of the reverse reactions. The mass distribution of ethane is shown in Figure 6 and of the products in Figure 7. The corresponding isotopomer distributions are shown in Table 2. Figure 6 and Table 2 show that the isotopomer distribution in ethane is unchanged throughout the experiment and corresponds to pure 13C12CH6. This indicates that no reverse (i.e., ethene hydrogenation) reaction takes place under the present experimental conditions. Only 4% of the produced methane contains labeled carbon, which corresponds well with the 12C/13C distribution in methane expected if methane is produced from ethene only (i.e., not directly from ethane). The isotopomer distribution in ethene is in agreement with the observed ethane conversion (5.4%). No 13C2H4 was observed, which indicates that there is no significant ethene production from recombination of C1 species, in agreement with thermodynamic restrictions (reaction Gibbs energy, ΔrG > 0). The isotopomer distribution in ethyne is practically identical as in ethene (Table 2), which indicates that also ethyne is produced via ethene, and not directly from ethane.

3.2.2 D-Labeling
This section describes the results from experiments where H2 in the feed was replaced with D2, and the deuterium distribution in reactants and products was followed. Two sets of such experiments were performed: (i) partial pressure variation of D2 and (ii) cofeeding of D2 during partial pressure variation of C2H4, with and without CO2 in the feed. The results from these experiments will be covered together because of similar and related results obtained.
A graphical illustration of the results obtained when H2 in the feed was replaced with D2 is shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9, as an example. The remainder of the results are presented in the tables (Tables 3 −5). No H−D exchange was observed in ethane under all conditions (as exemplified in Figure 8), which indicates that if ethane adsorbs on the catalyst, it reacts further to form other products. This applies under all studied reaction conditions and suggests that ethane chemisorption is the rate determining step of reaction. On the contrary, significant H−D exchange is observed in ethene under all conditions (see Tables 3−5), even at no ethane conversion in C2H6/C2H4 cofeed experiments (Table 4, last column). This observation shows that ethene dehydrogenation/rehydrogenation reactions are fast compared to ethane dehydrogenation reactions.

aNo methane formation was observed under present conditions.
Isotopic exchange in ethene was examined also over the carrier material alone, at 600 °C and at room temperature (rt) (not shown). At 600 °C only 2% of ethene underwent H−D exchange (one H exchanged with D), at rt no isotopic exchange was observed. Therefore, most of the H−D exchange in ethene must proceed via adsorption at the metal sites.
The water−gas-shift reaction is expected to proceed also over the basic sites of the support, and could lead to increased amount of H−D molecules in the gas phase, which would in turn increase H−D exchange in ethene. The H−D distribution in ethene was therefore compared in similar experiments with and without CO2 in the feed (Table 4 vs Table 5). The isotopomer distribution pattern in ethene is similar for all performed experiments, both with and without CO2 present and with and without added C2H4. This observation indicates that the water−gas-shift reaction does not affect the dehydrogenation reaction significantly. In all experiments, one by one exchange of H with D is observed in ethene, and the relative abundances of the fragments decrease in the order C2H4 > C2H3D > C2H2D2 > C2HD3 > C2D4.
The isotopomer distribution in ethyne is shown in Tables 3−5. Ethyne shows more H−D exchange than ethene, which indicates that ethyne formation is slow compared to ethene formation (i.e., ethane dehydrogenation) and implies than ethyne intermediates have a longer residence time on the catalyst surface. This is in line with the observed low ethyne selectivity (see Table 1). Similar to the H−D distribution in ethene, the H−D distribution in ethyne is unchanged with and without added CO2 (Table 4 vs Table 5). Interestingly, the ethyne isotopomer distribution is strongly displaced toward the deuterated products when returning to the standard test conditions after D2 and C2H4 partial pressure variation (see Table 3 and Table 5, last column).
Similar to ethyne, the isotopomer distribution in methane is displaced toward higher D numbers at standard conditions after D2 partial pressure variation (Table 3, last column). Moreover, the isotopomer distribution in methane is strongly displaced toward higher D numbers in the experiments with D2/C2H6 ratios above approximately 1:5 and conversions below 6% (i.e., high D2/H2 ratios), as can be seen in Table 3 and Table 4.
In section 3.2.1, it was observed that methane is formed via ethene, and not directly from ethane. However, because of the high H−D exchange degree in ethene, no information could be drawn about the detailed mechanism of methane formation.
4 Discussion
4.1 General
The Horiuti−Polanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts. (13-15, 17-20) For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
The species denoted (ads) represent intermediates adsorbed at the catalyst surface. At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of ethane has been observed to be the rate determining step (rds) over a range of metal catalysts, (13, 14) and in particular over Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts. (18-20)
However, this reaction mechanism does not take side reactions into account. To consider byproducts and surface intermediates of the side reactions, literature that deals with ethane hydrogenolysis can be helpful. Ethane hydrogenolysis studies are especially relevant for our study since we have observed that reactions giving methane as a product are the main side reaction of ethane dehydrogenation over the Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst. Sinfelt and co-workers proposed a reaction mechanism according to which ethane hydrogenolysis proceeds over Pt and other transition metals via C2Hx or C1Hy adsorbed species via the following steps: (30-32)
(1)
(5)
(6)
(7)
The C−C bond scission step is often assumed to be rate determining. Although there is general agreement about the overall mechanism of ethane hydrogenolysis over Pt and other transition metals, there is no agreement on the degree of dehydrogenation of the C2Hx surface species that are important in the C−C bond scission. In particular, over supported and unsupported Pt surfaces, C2Hx adsorbed species with x in the range 0−5 have been reported to be the surface intermediates responsible for cleavage of the C−C bond. (31-34) It has further been reported that the number of hydrogen atoms in the adsorbed C2Hx in which C−C bond cleaves may differ from one surface to another. (32) Interestingly, Cortright et al. (31) studied ethane hydrogenolysis over Pt by a combination of reaction kinetics, microcalorimetry, and spectroscopic and quantum chemical studies and concluded that the primary reaction pathways for cleavage of the C−C bond take place through less stable ethyl (C2H5) and ethylidene (CHCH3) species not generally observed by spectroscopic methods, while the more abundant surface species usually observed during ethene adsorption (e.g., ethylidyne and di-σ-bonded ethene) are not directly involved in the primary reaction pathways, but affect the observed kinetic rates through blocking of sites.
Under ethene hydrogenation conditions at rt, di-σ-bonded ethene, π-bonded ethene, ethylidyne (CCH3), and, under high hydrogen to ethene pressure ratios, small quantities of ethyl surface species have been observed by IR-spectroscopy on Pt/SiO2 catalysts (17, 35) and by in situ infrared-visible sum frequency generation on Pt(111). (15) Addition of Sn has been shown to suppress ethylidyne formation on Pt,Sn/SiO2 catalysts compared to Pt/SiO2, and the relative amounts of ethylidyne species formed decreased with increasing Sn content of the catalyst. (35)
4.2 Ethane Dehydrogenation and Ethene Hydrogenation
The experimental results of dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene and hydrogenation of ethene to ethane will be discussed in this section. From partial pressure variation experiments, the reaction orders of ethane dehydrogenation with respect to hydrogen, ethene, and ethane could be estimated to −0.4, −0.9, and 0.95, respectively. Negative dependence of the reaction rate on ethene and hydrogen could be explained either by increased reverse reaction or by increased occupation of active surface sites by species of ethene and hydrogen adsorption. From the D2 isotopic labeling experiments, no H−D exchange in ethane was observed under all conditions. This indicates that no significant reverse reaction takes place, even under the highest hydrogen and ethene partial pressures, and that the negative dependence of the reaction rate on ethene and hydrogen partial pressures can be attributed to an increased occupation of active surface sites by species of ethene and hydrogen adsorption.
The reaction order with respect to ethane is close to first order. It could be postulated that the deviation from first order is caused by the occupation of the catalytically active sites by adsorbed species. To account for the partial occupation of the catalyst surface by the adsorbed species, a rate equation was derived based on the elementary steps 1−4 above. Assuming that step 1 is rate-determining, and that all adsorbed species occupy one surface site at a time, the following rate equation was derived for ethane dehydrogenation:
(8)
where K2, K3 and K4 are equilibrium constants in steps 2−4, respectively, and k is the rate constant of the rate determining step of the reaction. The constants k, K2, K3, and K4 were determined by fitting eq 8 to the experimental data of partial pressure variation of hydrogen and ethene. The obtained values of the constants are presented in Table 6. The normalized conversion as a function of ethane partial pressure, which could then be calculated from the rate equation, agreed well with the observed normalized conversions (Figure 2). This indicated that the observed deviation from first order reaction with respect to ethane could be attributed to the partial occupation of the catalyst surface by the adsorbed species.

aThe rate equation could not be fitted to the entire data set for partial pressure variation of C2H4. The data points corresponding to lowest ethene partial pressure have been used in the fitting of the rate equation since those points represent the conditions closest to those present under ethane partial pressure variation. Three data points corresponding to the highest ethene partial pressure were disregarded. For the C2H4 rate data that were used in the fitting the RMSE value was 4%.
The rate equation above is based on the assumption that only surface species C2H5 (ads), C2H4 (ads), and H (ads) are present on the catalyst surface. It is, however, known that also other species, which are products of ethane and ethene adsorption (e.g., ethylidene (CHCH3), ethylidyne (CCH3), and vinylidene (CCH2)), are present on the catalyst surface. (15, 17, 31, 35-37) These species have however been reported to act as spectators and not participate directly in the dehydrogenation reaction; (17) some might, however participate in methane formation. (31) During the partial pressure variation experiments conversion at reference conditions was measured before and after each pressure variation (as shown in Figure 1), and conversions relative to standard conditions were used during fitting of the experimental data (see section 2.2 for experimental details). By performing the experiment in this way, one compensates for carbonaceous deposits and other nonreactive species (i.e., spectators) on the catalyst surface, since changes in the reaction rate relative to some reference conditions are compared. Compared to surface intermediates in ethene formation, species that are intermediates in methane formation have low reactivity, as can be seen from low methane selectivity (see Table 1). Those species are therefore also compensated for during the measurement sequence of the experiment.
The relative abundances of the different ethene species observed during deuterium labeling experiments, decrease in the order C2H4 > C2H3D > C2H2D2 > C2HD3 > C2D4, and significantly more monodeuterated than bideuterated ethene is observed. The observation that one hydrogen at the time is exchanged with deuterium might be interpreted such that ethene is adsorbed end-on at the catalyst surface. However, since step 2 in the reaction mechanism above is in partial equilibrium, the observed exchange pattern is also consistent with ethene being adsorbed through π or σ bond via the C−C bond.
H2O addition does not show negative effect on the reaction rate of dehydrogenation of ethane, even at quite high partial pressures (up to approximately 0.7 bar). This might indicate that H2O does not compete for the same adsorption sites as ethane, ethene, and hydrogen. Moreover, at lower partial pressures (below 0.2 bar) steam has a strong positive effect on the reaction rate. The simplest explanation to increased dehydrogenation rate with H2O addition is removal of carbon deposits from the Pt surface by coke gasification reactions, as also suggested by Bednarova (38) over similar catalysts and by Nakagawa et al. over Ga2O3/TiO2 catalysts. (9, 10) This interpretation is further strengthened by the observation of a slight reduction of the deactivation rate, observed by a visual inspection of the measured activity profiles, in the presence of steam (section 3.1.2).
As presented in section 3.1.2, lower deactivation rates were observed with increased partial pressure of hydrogen. Additionally, a gradual increase in activity was observed when a hydrogen-containing feed was put on after a feed without hydrogen. Two phenomena can explain the observed behavior: (i) Presence of hydrogen in the feed contributes to keeping Pt in the reduced state and therefore also to maintain high catalytic activity. Oxidation of Pt under low partial pressures of H2, or absence of H2, might therefore be the origin of the observed increase of the deactivation rate, and the observed gradual increase in activity after increased H2 partial pressure or readdition of H2 might be due to rereduction of Pt when hydrogen is returned. (ii) Hydrogen present in the feed might hydrogenate the highly dehydrogenated coke precursors at the catalyst surface and in this way prevent coke formation, which would result in reduced deactivation rate. Hydrogenation of highly dehydrogenated species formed on the catalyst surface in absence of hydrogen would also explain the gradual increase of activity after hydrogen addition.
Alternative i seems not very likely since the reaction Gibbs energy (ΔrG) of Pt + O2 → PtO2 is 163 kJ/mol at 623 °C (calculated using thermodynamical data from ref 39), meaning that O2 pressures in the order of 105 bar are necessary to have a significant fraction of Pt in an oxidized state. Similarly, the reaction PtO2 + 2H2 → Pt + H2O has a ΔrG = −560 kJ/mol at 623 °C and is thus strongly shifted toward reduced Pt at present experimental conditions. Those findings are also confirmed by previous in situ XPS measurements (25) showing that Pt in a PtSn2 alloy was present in the reduced state alloyed with Sn under reduction and reaction conditions, while large amounts of reduced Pt were observed in a Pt/Mg(Al)O catalyst both under reaction and oxidation conditions as well as in a hydrogen-steam mixture, all at 450 °C.
Concerning alternative ii, methane formation from methyl (CH3), methylene (CH2), and methylidyne (CH) are thermodynamically feasible (ΔrG < 0), while the reaction C + 2H2 → CH4 has ΔrG > 0 (thermodynamical data obtained from ref 40). In fact, the observed displacement of the methane and ethyne isotopomer distributions toward higher D numbers when returning to standard conditions after D2 and C2H4 partial pressure variation might be due to rehydrogenation of strongly dehydrogenated species formed on the catalyst surface during the experiments with low D2 or high C2H4 partial pressures, which lead to higher deactivation rate of the catalyst. The observed indications of higher deactivation rate with increased ethene partial pressure point toward that ethene, especially at higher concentrations, might contribute to formation of coke precursors.
A third, unexplored possibility is reorganization of the catalyst surface upon hydrogen adsorption, as reported by Gao and Schmidt and Wang et al. (41, 42) They studied Pt particles on SiO2 and γ-Al2O3 and found that annealing in H2 at 600 °C produced predominantly cube-shaped particles exposing mostly (100) planes, while heating cubic particles in other gases than H2 (e.g., air or N2) caused a transformation to spherical shapes which exposed all planes. Possible similar variations of surface properties with H2 partial pressure cannot be excluded even in the present case.
CO2 presence in the feed not only reduced deactivation rate significantly, it also led to changes in selectivity by promoting methane formation (although no CH4 formation from CO2 is observed), as shown in Table 1. The reduced deactivation rate in the presence of CO2 can also (as in the case of steam addition) be explained by removal of carbon deposits from the Pt surface by coke gasification reactions, as also suggested for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 addition over Ga2O3 catalysts on various supports (9, 10) and for isobutane dehydrogenation with CO2 addition over iron-loaded activated carbon catalyst. (11) Rasko and Solymosi (43) investigated interactions of CH3 adsorbed on titania with CO2. Their IR measurements indicated that a reaction occurred between CH3(a) and CO2. The authors suggested that CO2 can either combine with adsorbed species CH3(ads) to give methoxy species (CH3O(ads)) or first react with CH3(ads) to produce CH2(ads) fragments (plus CO and H2O), which can combine with CO2 to produce formaldehyde (CH2O). Both formaldehyde and methoxy species decompose to H2 and CO. If these reactions are fast enough, the probability of the complete decomposition of CHx fragments to surface carbon can be reduced.
Over Rh/SiO2 catalyst Rasko and Solymosi (44) observed that adsorbed CH3 reacted with CO2 to give CH4 and CO at and above 373 K. The authors concluded that CHx fragments (formed in the decomposition of CH4 over supported Rh) react with CO2 without their complete decomposition to surface carbon. This observation is also in line with our measurements showing increased methane formation during ethane dehydrogenation over Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O with addition of CO2.
Another possible explanation of increased methane formation when CO2 is added could be an increase in hydrocracking activity due to altering of the acid−base properties of the support upon CO2 addition, as observed by Nakagawa et al. (9, 10)
Returning now to the reaction mechanism for ethane dehydrogenation presented above, the indications from the D labeling experiments pointing toward ethane adsorption being the rate determining step of the reaction are further strengthened by the ethene hydrogenation experiment, showing negative activation energy in the range 497−596 °C. The negative activation energy of ethene (as well as other light alkenes and aromatics) hydrogenation at elevated temperatures (i.e., at temperatures above the optimum temperature) has been observed previously over a range of metal catalysts. (13, 14, 18, 45) When desorption is the rate determining step of reaction, negative apparent activation energy can be observed because the decrease of the surface coverage with increasing temperature overcompensates the increase of the rate constant of the rate determining step of the hydrogenation reaction.
5 Conclusions
The following conclusions can be drawn from the performed kinetic measurements and isotopic labeling experiments during ethane dehydrogenation over a Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst:
•Ethane, ethene and hydrogen compete for the same adsorption sites, while water does not seem to compete for the same surface active sites.
•H2 inhibits catalyst deactivation, probably by hydrogenation of highly dehydrogenated coke precursors at the catalyst surface.
•CO2 addition has also an inhibiting effect on catalyst deactivation, probably by reaction with coke precursors on the surface.
•Methane is the main side product of ethane dehydrogenation over Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O. It is formed via ethene and not directly from ethane.
•Ethyne is also formed via ethene and not directly from ethane.
