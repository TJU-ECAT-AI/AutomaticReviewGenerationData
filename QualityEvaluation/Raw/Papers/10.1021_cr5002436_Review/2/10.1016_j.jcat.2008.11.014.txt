Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCr–SBA-15 and xCr–Al2O3 catalysts,
prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and
distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function. To this end, the catalysts were characterized
by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron
microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM–EDXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XANES and EXAFS). All these characterization techniques indicate that, at ⩽1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains
exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral (Td) coordination,
whilst on γ -Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species. At
⩾5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, besides a fraction of isolated Cr(VI)
species in Td coordination. Remarkably, γ -Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of
nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles. Among xCr–SBA-15 catalysts, those
containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., ⩽1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with
respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (⩾5 wt% Cr). The
intrinsic activity of these isolated Cr species is higher than those observed on γ -Al2O3 (⩽1 wt% Cr).
Interestingly, among xCr–Al2O3, the catalysts dominated by oligomeric species show the highest activity,
indicating the important role of the species in the reaction. In situ XAS studies evidence that active
Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation
state. Based on ex situ and in situ characterization results and catalytic data, it appears that the activity
of the Cr species is different in xCr–SBA-15 and xCr–Al2O3. For xCr–SBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with
coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface
of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCr–Al2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than
the isolated Cr sites.

1. Introduction
Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose
propylene production technologies that has received much atten-
tion in the recent past [1,2] due to it’s potential to make-up the
shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g.,
FCC) [3–5]. Propylene is an important building block in a myriad

of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of
polypropylene [6,7]. Typically, the CrOx–Al2O3 catalyst system is
used for industrial processes, for example in the Catoﬁn process
(ABB Lummus) that runs at cyclic operation (reaction and regen-
eration) at ∼850 K [8]. However, major challenges associated with
this catalytic system are cracking and coking which inﬂuence the
product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively. Thus, the de-
activated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing
dehydrogenation activity, selectivity to propylene and catalyst sta-
bility, which makes the process not only complex but also expen-
sive. Therefore, considerable research has been done to gain a deep
fundamental knowledge on the structure–reactivity relationships of
Cr catalysts in dehydrogenation of alkanes by various characteriza-
tion techniques [9–18] and to improve catalytic performance.

Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP)
was also extensively studied to overcome the challenges associated
with DHP however without much success in terms of commercial
viability [19]. Nonetheless, CO2 was interestingly reported as an al-
ternative to O2 or N2O as an oxidizing agent for ODHP, in which
again Cr based catalysts were found to be more active than other
metal catalysts [16,20–22]. Especially, Cr supported on silicon (ei-
ther on SiO2 or on siliceous mesoporous materials like SBA-15 and
MCM-41) have shown higher activity than the regular catalysts, for
example on Al2O3 [20,21]. Thus, these materials have recently got
attention to understand their better catalytic performance either
in ODHP or in DHP as compared to other catalysts [15,16,20].
As evidenced from various studies, the distribution of Cr species
is strongly dependent on the nature of the support, Cr content
and method of activation [23–30]. A variety of Cr species (iso-
lated, dimers, trimers, polymeric species with different nuclearity
and large Cr2O3 clusters) with different oxidation and coordina-
tion states and with different redox properties coexist in the same
catalyst. It is known that DHP activity increases with Cr loading
and a typical industrial Cr catalyst contains ∼13 wt% Cr at which
level heterogeneous distribution of Cr species is virtually unavoid-
able [23–30]. Thus, it has been a major challenge to gain deﬁnitive
information on the nature of active Cr sites. As a result, the na-
ture of active Cr species in Cr catalysts during DHP remains elusive
and is still a subject of debate [9–18]. For instance, studies on Cr–
ZrO2 catalysts with a Cr content of 0.05 to 0.8 wt% showed that
mononuclear Cr(III) species are the active sites [31]. The same con-
clusion was also reached after considerable studies on Cr–Al2O3
and other Cr catalysts [13,32–34]. In contrast, it was concluded
that coordinatively unsaturated clustered Cr(III) and/or Cr(II) sites
play an important role in the activation of alkanes while crys-
talline α-Cr2O3 are rather inert [9,10,12]. In a different study, La
doped Cr–Al2O3 and Cr–ZrO2 catalysts monitored during DHP si-
multaneously by in situ—EPR and—UV/vis coupled with online GC
showed that in both the catalysts the oxidation state of Cr is not
higher than (III) however, coordination state of Cr species was not
discussed [11]. The structure of Cr species in differently prepared
Cr–MCM-41 (Cr content varied between 0.35 and 1.7 wt%) stud-
ied by in situ XAS (XANES and EXAFS) showed that aggregated
Cr(III) are the active sites for DHP [15,16], which is similar to that
concluded on Cr–Al2O3 [12]. On the other hand, a study on the
oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) with CO2 over Cr/H-
ZSM-5 concludes that a redox cycle between Cr+6 and Cr+3 is
important for a high dehydrogenation rate [22].
In the present work, a series of Cr catalysts with varying Cr con-
tent (0.5–10 wt%) was prepared aiming to create a well deﬁned Cr
site distribution in the catalysts and thereby to derive the catalytic
function of each speciﬁc Cr species. To this end, SBA-15 and γ -
Al2O3 supports were employed. On high surface area mesoporous
SBA-15, it was expected that highly dispersed and completely ac-
cessible isolated Cr species can be created. The large pores and
the weak acidity of SBA-15 should facilitate adequate transport of
gaseous reactants and products to and from the active Cr species.
This in turn should lead to better catalytic performance and stabil-
ity than the regular catalysts [20]. The structure and catalytic prop-
erties of these Cr species are compared with those supported on
γ -Al2O3, which is typically used in industrial DHP processes and
is also known to contain well deﬁned Cr site distribution depend-
ing on the Cr content [26,27,30]. This will allow us to investigate
the inﬂuence of the molecular structure, which is dependent on
the nature of the support as evident from literature, of Cr species
on DHP with identical Cr content and in some cases (at ⩽1 wt%
Cr) with similar Cr distribution. The nature and distribution of
Cr species in the catalysts was thoroughly investigated by vari-
ous characterization techniques that are complementary to each
other. The behavior of Cr species during DHP was monitored by in

situ—X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) which is a powerful tool
to investigate the oxidation and coordination state of Cr species,
however under suitable experimental conditions [36]. Steady-state
catalytic activity tests were performed isothermally at 853 K. The
correlation of steady-state activity data and characterization results
derived from ex situ and in situ spectroscopic studies enabled us
to gain new insights into the nature of active Cr species involved
in DHP.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
The parent siliceous SBA-15 was prepared in our laboratory ac-
cording to the recipe reported elsewhere [37–39]. Brieﬂy, a gel
prepared from Pluronic P123 (EO20PO70EO20, BASF), the template,
2 M HCl and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, Alfa Aesar, 99%), silicon
source, was stirred at 313 K for 24 h. The gel was then transferred
into a Teﬂon bottle and aged in an oven at 373 K for 48 h. The
resulting white solid was ﬁltered, washed thoroughly with double
deionized water and dried at room temperature for 24 h. The ﬁ-
nal product was then calcined in ﬂowing air at 823 K for 6 h to
remove the template and thereby to produce mesoporous SBA-15.
The γ -Al2O3 (Puralox from Sasol) was calcined at 773 K for 6 h
prior to using it as a catalyst support.
A series of xCr–SBA-15 and xCr–Al2O3 catalysts (x in the catalyst
label represents the nominal Cr content, wt%) were prepared by
incipient wetness impregnation. Impregnation solutions were pre-
pared by dissolving appropriate amounts of Cr(NO3)2 9H2O (Merck,
98–100%) in double deionized water. The resulting solution was
added dropwise to the supports, which have been pre-treated in
an oven at 373 K for 16 h. After impregnation, the samples were
dried at 383 K for 10 h and subsequently calcined at 823 K for 5 h,
with a heating rate of 2 K min−1. Physical appearances of the cata-
lysts are as follows: 0.5Cr–SBA-15 and 1Cr–SBA-15 are pale yellow
while 5Cr–SBA-15 and 10Cr–SBA-15 are dark green which is char-
acteristic of the reference sample α-Cr2O3. Interestingly, none of
the catalysts in the series of xCr–Al2O3 show the latter color and
0.5Cr–Al2O3 is the only one that is pale yellow. 1Cr–Al2O3 is pale
yellow with a shade of pale green. 5Cr–Al2O3 and 10Cr–Al2O3 are
light and dark brownish in color, respectively. The varying colours
of the catalysts indicate that Cr speciation is different in them [22].
The composition and textural properties of the catalysts are pre-
sented in Table 1.
2.2. Characterization techniques
Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K were ob-
tained on a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 instrument. Prior to the
experiments, the samples were evacuated at 473 K for 12 h. The
total surface area of the samples was determined by the Brunauer–
Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The pore size distributions were
118

obtained from the desorption branch of the isotherm using the
Barrett–Joyner–Halender (BJH) model [40].
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts
were collected on a D8FOCUS (Bruker AXS) instrument using CuKα
radiation (λ = 1.54 Å, 35 kV and 40 mA). XRD data were collected
in the 2θ range of 20◦–80◦using a step size of 0.020◦and a step
time of 2.5 s.
Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) measurements were per-
formed using a JEOL 2010F microscope operated at 200 kV. The
catalysts were dispersed in isopropanol and dropped on carbon-
ﬁlm coated copper grids and dried in air.
UV-Raman measurements were performed on a LabRam HR-UV
spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon). The spectra were recorded with
a 325 excitation laser provided by He–Cd source. Spectra were
recorded at an exposure time of 10 s and an accumulation number
of 20.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data were collected in
transmission mode at the Swiss–Norwegian Beamlines (SNBL)
at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble.
Spectra were obtained at the Cr K-edge (5.989 keV) using a double
crystal Si(111) monochromator and higher order harmonics were
rejected by detuning the crystals. Ion chamber detectors were used
to determine intensities of the incident (Io) and transmitted (It)
X-rays. Based on the Cr content in the catalysts, required amounts
of catalyst powder were mixed with desired amounts of boron
nitride (BN) to obtain an appropriate absorber thickness. In situ
XAS experiments were carried out in a heatable X-ray reaction cell
equipped with a temperature programmer and a gas-dosing system
with mass-ﬂow controllers. In situ experiments were performed
at 823 K according to the following sequence: (a) oxidative pre-
treatment in 5% O2 in He (15 ml min−1) for 1 h, (b) behavior of Cr
species during DHP is studied by changing the ﬂow from O2 to 5%
C3H8 in He (15 ml min−1) for 15 min (denoted as ﬁrst run), (c) fol-
lowed by regeneration by switching to 5% O2 in He (15 ml min−1)
and (d) subsequently a second DHP run was performed by chang-
ing the ﬂow from O2 to 5% C3H8 in He (15 ml min−1) for 1 h. After
every step, the catalyst was ﬂushed with He ﬂow for 5 min. Af-
ter step (d), the catalyst was cooled down to room temperature in
the ﬂow of He and the extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure
(EXAFS) spectra were then recorded. In the ﬁrst run, in situ X-
ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were recorded
during DHP at 823 K in the following intervals by switching ﬂow
from C3H8 to pure He: after 90 s and at every 3, 10 and 15 min.
In the second run, XANES spectra were taken before (i.e., after the
regeneration) and after 1 h DHP at 823 K as well as at room tem-
perature after cooling down in the ﬂow of He.
The WINXAS v3.1 software was used for XANES analysis to ob-
tain qualitative and quantitative information on Cr species [41].
The XAS data were pre-edge background subtracted (linear ﬁt)
and normalized. The EXAFS data were treated with the pro-
gram EXCURV98 using curved-wave theory and ab initio phase
shifts [42]. Chromium metal foil, CrO2, CrO3, Cr2O3, Na2CrO4,
K2Cr2O7, chromium acetate and CrCl3 were used as model com-
pounds. The XANES spectra of the model compounds were used to
assess the different chromium phases that are present in the cata-
lysts by a linear combination method.
The catalysts performance in the DHP reaction was studied us-
ing a tapered element oscillating microreactor (TEOM, Series 1500
PMA, Rupprecht and Patashnick Co.) that is connected to an on-
line gas-chromatograph (GC), which is a well established system
in our laboratory for this reaction. Moreover, a TEOM reactor was
also recently used by other researchers to investigate the fea-
sibility of a cyclically operated continuous propylene production
process via oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with N2O on Fe-
zeolites [43]. However, in the present study the mass change due
to coke formation could not be measured because of a high noise
level. The detailed description of the equipment employed in the
present study was reported elsewhere [1,39]. Gas ﬂows, temper-
atures, TEOM operation and data collection were controlled and
operated using Lab-View software.
The TEOM reactor was loaded with 50 mg of catalyst, ﬁrmly
packed between two plugs of quartz wool and retained there by a
ventilated metal cap [1,39]. Prior to the experiments, the catalysts
were pre-treated in ﬂowing O2 (5 ml min−1 in 45 ml min−1 of He)
at 753 K for 1 h followed by heating in He ﬂow (50 ml min−1)
to the reaction temperature (853 K). At this temperature, DHP
(5 ml min−1 of C3H8 in 45 ml min−1 of He) was carried out for
2 h (denoted as ﬁrst run). Afterwards, the catalyst was cooled
down to 753 K in a ﬂow of He and regenerated by replacing He
ﬂow with O2 (5 ml min−1 in 45 ml min−1 of He) for 1 h. Subse-
quently by changing the ﬂow from O2 to He (50 ml min−1), the
catalyst was heated to the reaction temperature where a second
DHP run was performed to investigate the inﬂuence of the regen-
eration step on the catalytic activity. The gaseous reaction mixture
was preheated at 723 K in the preheating zone before entering on
to the catalyst bed. A purge gas (He) ﬂow of 200 ml min−1 was
used. The space velocity (SV) was calculated as gpropane g−1
cat h−1
and was 11.78 h−1. The product gases were analyzed by an on-
line GC (HP 5890) equipped with a FID, using GS-Q column (30 m
length and 0.543 mm i.d., allowing the separation of hydrocarbons
upto C3) and controlled by HP ChemStation software. The conver-
sion of propane was calculated from the amount (in mole fraction)
of propane detected at the outlet by GC. The selectivity of the
product was calculated from the amount of the product formed
divided by the amount of propane reacted.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of catalysts
3.1.1. N2 adsorption–desorption
The chemical composition and textural properties of the cat-
alysts are compared in Table 1. The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms and pore size distribution of Cr supported SBA-15 are
shown in Fig. 1. The isotherms of the catalysts show the charac-
teristic behavior of ordered mesoporous materials exhibiting an
irreversible type IV isotherm with a well-deﬁned hysteresis loop
of type H1 at p/p0 > 0.66 (Fig. 1A), which can be associated with
capillary condensation and desorption in open ended cylindrical
mesopores [38,44]. The pore diameter distribution in the cata-
lysts was determined by the BdB model applied to the desorption
branch of the isotherms. It predicts a pore size distribution be-
tween 7.2–8.3 nm in the catalysts (Fig. 1B). The total BET surface
area and pore volume of the catalysts are decreasing, as expected,
with increasing Cr content. This suggests that at higher Cr load-
ings some of the pores might be partly occupied by chromium
(Table 1). However, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the cat-
alysts and the pore size distribution in them (Fig. 1 and Table 1)
clearly show that the mesoporous structure is not disrupted even
at the highest Cr content in the catalyst.
Fig. 2 shows N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size
distribution of Cr supported on γ -Al2O3 catalysts. Like xCr–SBA-
15, the isotherms of these catalysts also represent the type IV
with a hysteresis loop of type H1, indicating the presence of meso-
pores [45,46]. The catalysts with ⩽1 wt% Cr exhibit a well-deﬁned
hysteresis loop at p/p0 > 0.66 while, it shifted to the left (at
p/p0 > 0.56) for the catalysts with ⩾5 wt% Cr (Fig. 2A), suggesting
a partial coverage of pores by Cr species. This is also reﬂected in
the pore size distribution in the catalysts (Fig. 2B). It can be seen
from Fig. 2B and Table 1 that catalysts with ⩽1 wt% Cr show an
average pore diameter of ∼7 nm while, the 5Cr–Al2O3 exhibits a

bimodal pore size distribution indicating the presence of Cr species
within the pores. Accordingly, by increasing the Cr content from 5
to 10 wt% in 10Cr–Al2O3, a distribution of an uniform pore size
of ∼5 nm was achieved. Such behavior was not observed for sup-
port SBA-15 and it indicates that Cr species are essentially located
within the pore of Al2O3 with perhaps uniform distribution.
3.1.2. X-ray diffraction
XRD patterns of the catalysts are compared in Fig. 3. Catalysts
5Cr–SBA-15 and 10Cr–SBA-15 show XRD reﬂections at 2θ of 24.6◦,
33.2◦, 36.2◦, 41.6◦, 50.3◦, 54.9◦, 63.5◦, 65.15◦, 73.05◦and 76.87◦
which are characteristic for crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase [36,47,48].
These XRD reﬂections are not observed for catalysts 0.5Cr–SBA-15
and 1Cr–SBA-15. Similarly, the series of xCr–Al2O3 show XRD re-
ﬂections of the support but no reﬂections that can be assignable to
chromium oxide phases, indicating that either chromium is highly
dispersed in the catalysts or that the size of CrxOy clusters may be
small to be detected by XRD. Therefore, the catalysts were further
characterized by STEM and EDXS.
3.1.3. STEM and EDXS
STEM and EDXS were used to investigate the morphology of
the support materials and distribution of Cr species as well as the
degree of agglomeration of chromium oxide species (Fig. 4A). It
should be mentioned that analysis for 1 and 5 wt% Cr catalysts are
presented assuming that they would also represent 0.5 and 10 wt%
Cr catalysts, respectively. In Fig. 4, it is seen that support SBA-15
particles show the characteristic rod-like morphology with more
or less uniform size distribution [37]. The morphology of both the
support materials is intact even after Cr deposition followed by
subsequent pre-treatments. For instance, the well ordered uniform
mesoporous channels of support SBA-15 can be seen the micro-
graphs in regions where the sample is suitable oriented. The STEM
micrographs of 1Cr–SBA-15, 1Cr–Al2O3 and 5Cr–Al2O3 in Fig. 4A
do not show any clusters of CrxOy species indicating that Cr is
well dispersed within the pores of the support, while 5Cr–SBA-15
contains crystalline Cr2O3 particles which can be seen as bright
essentially needle-shaped and a few cube-shaped structures, in
agreement with XRD. The size of the crystals is much larger than
the size of pores in the support SBA-15 (Table 1). Thus, it can be
suggested that the crystals are located at the external surface of
SBA-15. EDXS conﬁrms on the one hand the formation of crys-
talline Cr2O3 particles in 5Cr–SBA-15 and on the other hand the
uniform distribution of Cr species within the pores of the cata-
lyst 5Cr–Al2O3 (Fig. 4B). To assess this, the catalysts were further
characterized by UV-Raman spectroscopy which provides molecu-
lar information on the state of Cr species in the catalysts.
3.1.4. UV-Raman spectroscopy
UV-Raman spectra of the series of xCr–SBA-15 and xCr–Al2O3
are shown in Fig. 5. It can be readily seen that the position
and shape of Raman bands are different for both types of cata-
lysts indicating that the molecular structure of Cr species might
be different. Raman bands, in particular in the range from 800
to 1000 cm−1, are narrow and more deﬁned in the spectra of
xCr–SBA-15 whereas, for xCr–Al2O3 they are broad and several
bands overlap. Nonetheless, the catalysts show characteristic Ra-
man bands of chromium oxo species that are similar to the pre-
vious observations reported on Cr supported on SiO2 and Al2O3
[23–30]. Despite extensive studies on the supported chromium cat-
alysts by Raman spectroscopy, the assignment of Raman bands is
not straightforward [16,24–30,49], which could be due to the com-
plex nature of the catalytic system.
As seen in Fig. 5a, 0.5Cr–SBA-15 shows an intense and narrow
band at ∼982 cm−1 which is frequently assigned to symmetric
stretching of Cr=O of surface monochromate species (CrO2−
4 ). Ad-
ditionally, less intense and broad chromium oxo Raman bands are

also observed at 895 and 400 cm−1. The former band is often as-
signed to hydrated dichromate (Cr2O2−
7 ) and the latter may be due
to the bending mode of CrO2 units [23,25,28]. These observations
suggest that chromium is highly dispersed in the catalyst, espe-
cially in the form of monochromate species. With increasing Cr
content from 0.5 to 10 wt%, the band at ∼980 cm−1 decreases
drastically in intensity, the band at ∼895 cm−1 completely disap-
pears and the band at around 400 cm−1 is virtually not affected,
whilst new bands at 545 and 298 cm−1 emerge (Figs. 5c and 5d).
The band at 545 cm−1 is typical of symmetric stretching mode of
Cr–O–Cr units in Cr2O3 crystals, whereas the band at 298 cm−1 is
due to bending mode of O–Cr–O units. These results suggest that
crystalline Cr2O3 particles are formed at the expense of monochro-
mate species by increasing Cr content, which conﬁrms the results
of XRD and STEM.

495, 605 and 807 cm−1 (Figs. 5a and 5b) which are assigned to dif-
ferent siloxane rings of SBA-15 [50]. The 495 and 807 cm−1 bands
disappear at higher Cr content (⩾5 wt%) whereas, the band at
605 cm−1 more or less completely vanishes at 1 wt% Cr but again
reappears at ⩾5 wt% Cr, however slightly blue shifted to 603 cm−1.
This could be due to either the symmetric stretching of Cr–O–Cr
units in polymeric Cr species [23] or the surface three membered
siloxane rings of SBA-15 [50]. The former is possible because both
the catalysts largely dominated by crystalline Cr2O3 particles that
are formed at the expense of monochromate species, which were
previously homogeneously covering the surface of SBA-15. How-
ever, the latter is also possible because the surface might have
been re-exposed in the catalysts.
As mentioned previously, the Raman spectra of xCr–Al2O3 is
different from that of xCr–SBA-15 and show broad and multiple
bands between 750–1050 cm−1 (Fig. 5). These bands are often ob-
served for Cr supported on Al2O3 [24–29]. The Raman spectrum
of 0.5Cr–Al2O3 shows a main broad band centered at 888 cm−1
which contains shoulders at 935 and 990 cm−1 and, in addition, a
band at 374 cm−1. The pair of 888 and 374 cm−1 bands is often
assigned to symmetric stretching and bending modes of hydrated
surface mono chromate species (CrO2−
4 ) [24]. Bands at 935 and
990 cm−1 appear as shoulders to the main band at 888 cm−1
and are tentatively attributed to hydrated di- and trichromates,
respectively [24,29]. All the Raman bands are also present in
1Cr–Al2O3 however, formation of di- and trichromate species is
more pronounced as evidenced by the increased intensity of the
corresponding bands (∼945 and ∼990 cm−1) at the expense of
monochromate species represented by the band at 888 cm−1 that
decreased in intensity. The intensity of the latter band further de-
creases and the band at 374 cm−1 more or less completely dis-
appears in spectra 5Cr–Al2O3 and 10Cr–Al2O3. New Raman bands
at ∼868, 956 and 1002 cm−1 emerge along with broad shoul-
ders (at ∼770 and ∼888 cm−1) to the band 868 cm−1. All these
bands point to the formation of polymeric species at the expense
of mono and dimeric species [27]. However, it should be noted
that the formation of large Cr2O3-like clusters was not detected,
unlike on SBA-15, as evidenced by the absence of a Raman band at
∼550 cm−1 which is typical of such clusters. This suggests that the
dispersion of Cr (at ⩾5 wt%) is higher on the support Al2O3 than
that on SBA-15. Moreover, the Raman results clearly show that
molecular structure of Cr species (that include chemical nature)
is different on both the supports and is dependent on the nature
of the support, which is indeed in line with previous reports [24].
This can be attributed to the presence of different degrees of sur-
face hydroxyl groups on the supports which are abundant on alu-
mina than on SBA-15. These surface hydroxyl groups play a critical
role in the dispersion of Cr species by reacting with it’s precur-

sor during the preparation and pre-treatment procedures that lead
to the anchoring of Cr as chromium oxo species to the support.
Consequently, it prevents the formation of large chromium oxide
clusters on alumina by trapping chromium oxo species within the
pores as evidenced by the decreased pore size distribution in 5Cr–
Al2O3 and 10Cr–Al2O3 (Fig. 2B and Table 1). This implies formation
of mono and oligomeric (including dimers) Cr species on the sup-
port Al2O3 as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy. Differently, due
to the lack of enough surface hydroxyl groups on support SBA-15,
excess of Cr tends to precipitate as Cr2O3 crystals. In particular, at
the external surface of SBA-15 where the particles can grow fur-
ther in size without affecting the pore geometry of the support
as evidenced by N2-physisorption, XRD and STEM–EDXS. However,
the effect of textural properties of the supports, such as intersti-
tial voids between the support particles, on the distribution of Cr
species may not be completely ruled out. Nonetheless, these ob-
servations are also in excellent agreement with previous studies
which suggest that Cr tends to form large Cr2O3 clusters more eas-
ily when it is supported on SiO2 than that on Al2O3 [24,26].
The structure of Cr species in the catalysts is further investi-
gated by XAS which provides information not only on the oxida-
tion and coordination state (XANES) of the Cr species but also on
the degree of clustering (EXAFS) [36]. Therefore, XAS studies were
primarily conducted to support the conclusions derived from Ra-
man and other characterization techniques and to examine the Cr
speciation in the catalysts in minute detail.
3.1.5. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
XANES
For comparative purposes, XANES spectra of various model
compounds that have well deﬁned oxidation and coordination
states of Cr species are compared in Fig. 6A. It can be readily seen
that Cr in tetrahedral (Td) coordination with an oxidation state of
(VI) (CrO3, K2Cr2O7 and Na2CrO4) shows a sharp pre-edge peak.
The position, intensity and shape of the peak are, however, slightly
different for these model compounds (Table 2) indicating the dif-
ferent nature of Cr centers in these compounds. The pre-edge peak
is frequently assigned to dipole forbidden electron transition from
1s →3d (energy states: A1 →E) [15,26,35,36,51]. This transition
occurs due to the lack of inversion center at the Cr metal cen-
ter in Td coordination, hence it is a Laporte allowed transition.
Likewise, symmetry of Cr sites in octahedral (O ct) coordination
is much higher as compared in Td thus, the electron transition
from 1s →3d is diﬃcult due to the presence of the inversion cen-
ter. Therefore, the intensity of the pre-edge peak is much lower
for α-Cr2O3 and CrO2 while Cr(II) in square planar in Cr acetate
shows a shoulder at 5.996 keV, which is located almost on the
edge. These differences in oxidation and coordination state of Cr
species are also reﬂected in the edge position of the model com-

pounds. In general with increasing symmetry at Cr metal centers
and with decreasing oxidation state from (VI) to (II), the edge po-
sition is red shifted (Fig. 6A).
Against this background, it can be clearly seen from Fig. 6B that
the pre-edge peak position and intensity as well as the edge po-
sitions are quite different for the catalysts (Table 2). It should be
noted that to obtain a satisfactory signal to noise ratio of XAS spec-
tra in the transmission mode a reasonable Cr content (e.g., 4 wt%)
is required [26,36] hence, only the catalysts with ⩾5 wt% Cr are
shown. The intensity of the pre-edge peak is, in general, higher for
xCr–Al2O3 than that for xCr–SBA-15. It decreases with increasing Cr
content from 5 to 10 wt% which is more pronounced for the lat-
ter catalysts (Table 2). Also, it can be seen from Fig. 6B and Table 2
that the pre-edge peak of xCr–Al2O3 is centered at a slightly lower
energy (though it should be treated with caution) than that of xCr–
SBA-15, suggesting the energy required for an electron transition
from 1s →3d is lower for Cr species supported on the former cat-
alysts. This is due to the fact that interactions between support
and Cr species are greater in xCr–Al2O3 than in xCr–SBA-15 due
to the presence of abundant surface hydroxyl groups in the former
(as discussed for Raman results, see above) [36]. This mainly has
two implications on the structure and electronic properties of Cr
species: (i) the interactions between support and Cr species gov-
ern the symmetry of the Cr centers and (ii) the distance between
the energy states is inﬂuenced by the ligand effect. Accordingly,
the edge position of xCr–Al2O3 is more close to CrO3, K2Cr2O7 and
Na2CrO4 while that of xCr–SBA-15 coincides with that of α-Cr2O3
and CrO2 (Table 2). This suggests that in xCr–Al2O3, Cr species
are mainly present as Cr(VI) in Td coordination while in xCr–SBA-
15, Cr(III) sites in O ct coordination are the dominating species.
Semi-quantitative data (not shown) on the composition of different
kinds of Cr species present in the catalysts, obtained by simulating
the experimental XANES spectra of the catalysts with the available
model compounds, also point to the same. These results conﬁrm
that the nature of Cr species is different in the catalysts and is
dependent on the nature of the support and Cr content, in accor-
dance with Raman results (Fig. 5).
EXAFS
The structure of Cr species in the catalysts is further studied by
the k2-weighted Fourier transform (FT) of EXAFS functions, non-
phase shift corrected. The EXAFS spectra of 5Cr–SBA-15 and 5Cr–
Al2O3 are compared with appropriate model compounds (based
on the quantitative data obtained by simulation of experimental
XANES spectra) for the sake of clarity (Fig. 7). Starting with the
model compounds, α-Cr2O3 shows three main peaks at 1.57, 2.62
and 3.57 Å which were frequently observed for the same com-
pound and were assigned to ﬁrst, second and third shell contri-

butions, respectively, of Cr(III) in an O ct coordination [15,36,52].
The model compound Na2CrO4 in which Cr(VI) is in Td coordi-
nation exhibits three main peaks at 1.46, 2.07 and 2.87 Å that are
arising from ﬁrst, second and third shell contributions, respectively.
CrO3 that also contains Cr(VI) in Td geometry exhibits only a single
peak centered at 1.35 Å attributable to ﬁrst shell contribution and
no signiﬁcant contributions from the higher shells, are observed.
From the spectra of these model compounds it can be readily seen
that the position and the intensity of the peaks are quite different
(Fig. 7). The different peak position is due to different Cr–O bond
distances in O ct and Td coordinations which are shorter in the lat-
ter state. The intensity of ﬁrst shell peak is much weaker for CrO3
than that of Na2CrO4 and α-Cr2O3, indicating a greater disorder in
Cr Td units. This could also explain the absence of contributions
from the higher shells in the spectrum of CrO3.
Based on this, 5 and 10 wt% Cr catalysts are analyzed by EX-
AFS (k2-weighted FT and non-phase shift corrected). For the sake
of clarity, only 5Cr–SBA-15 and 5Cr–Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 7.
For 5Cr–SBA-15, three main peaks are observed at 1.64, 2.41 and
3.36 Å. The peak at 1.64 Å indicates the single Cr–O bond nature
and is longer than that in model α-Cr2O3. Taking account of Ra-
man results, the peak can be attributed to either isolated Cr(VI)
or Cr(III) in clusters [36]. The second and third shell peaks are
similar to that observed for α-Cr2O3 indicating the existence of
crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles in the catalyst. Similar peaks are ob-

served for 10Cr–SBA-15 at 1.66, 2.62 and 3.50 Å which are more
intense and well deﬁned, in particular the latter two peaks, than
that in 5Cr–SBA-15. The peaks at 2.62 and 3.50 Å coincide well
with that of model α-Cr2O3 indicating the presence of well or-
dered chromium oxide crystals in the catalysts, in line with XRD,
STEM, Raman and XANES. Differently, 5Cr–Al2O3 and 10Cr–Al2O3
show a peak centered at 1.64 Å which contains a pronounced
shoulder at 1.34 Å and the contributions from higher coordination
shells are only weak conﬁrming no signiﬁcant cluster formation
in the catalysts. The shoulder at 1.34 Å coincides with that of a
main peak of CrO3 model compound indicating a short Cr–O bond
distance like in Td coordination. As evidenced by Raman, these cat-
alysts contain oligomeric species which are, however, not detected
by EXAFS suggesting that these species are very small in size with
greater disorder. These results are in excellent agreement with the
other characterization results discussed above.
In summary, N2-physisorption data of the Cr catalysts show that
the structure of the support is virtually intact even after Cr loading
onto the support followed by subsequent pre-treatments (drying
and calcination). The Cr speciation is dependent on the nature of
the supports and Cr loading as evidenced by XRD, STEM–EDXS,
UV-Raman, XANES and EXAFS. At ⩽1 wt% Cr loading, in general,
Cr species are well dispersed on both the supports SBA-15 and
Al2O3. In particular, on SBA-15 they are merely isolated Cr(VI) in
Td coordination while on Al2O3, oligomers (including dimers) are
also formed as evidenced by the Raman bands. Considering the
Raman and XANES results, it can be suggested that the nature of
Cr species on these supports is different. At ⩾5 wt% Cr loading,
the dispersion of chromium decreases implying the formation of
α-Cr2O3 crystals at the expense of isolated sites on SBA-15 while,
the dispersion is still high on Al2O3 and no detectable clusters have
formed.
3.2. Dehydrogenation of propane
The catalytic performance of the catalysts was studied to com-
prehend the relationship between the structure of Cr species as
evidenced by different characterization techniques and the DHP
activity. It should be mentioned that the catalytic data of 10Cr–
SBA-15 and 10Cr–Al2O3, which are similar to 5 wt% Cr catalysts
with respect to the nature and distribution of Cr species as evi-
denced by characterization results, are not presented due to tech-
nical problems in the TEOM setup. Fig. 8 shows C3H8 conversion
and selectivity to C3H6 over catalysts xCr–SBA-15 at 853 K. Initially,
complete combustion of C3H8 was observed hence, initial conver-
sion values were taken after 5 min steady state analysis. In general,
conversion of C3H8 increased with Cr content from 0.5 to 5 wt%.
In particular, 0.5Cr–SBA-15, which contains exclusively isolated Cr
species in Td coordination as evidenced by the Raman spectrum
(Fig. 5a), shows reasonable C3H8 conversion and it gradually de-
creases with time, indicating the involvement of the isolated Cr
species in DHP. Similarly, by increasing the Cr content from 0.5
to 1 wt%, which also contains exclusively isolated sites in Td co-
ordination (Fig. 5b), the C3H8 conversion is almost doubled. This
conﬁrms the involvement of the isolated Cr species in the DHP
reaction. However, it should be noted that C3H8 conversion did
not increase by ﬁve fold when the Cr content is increased from
1 to 5 wt%. Moreover, the conversion dramatically decreases with
time as compared with 0.5 and 1 wt% Cr catalysts (Fig. 8). This is
due to the fact that at this Cr loading, crystalline Cr2O3 particles
are formed at the expense of isolated Cr species in 5Cr–SBA-15 as
evidenced by various characterization techniques. Thus, only a frac-
tion of Cr sites are available for DHP which in turn leads to lower
catalytic activity. The dramatic drop in the conversion may indicate
the involvement of Cr species, a majority of which are different in
nature as compared to the Cr sites in 1Cr–SBA-15. For instance,
the accessible Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3 particles
seem more sensitive to deactivation by coke formation [11,17,18],
than isolated Cr sites. This also suggests a possible ensemble effect
on the activity and deactivation. The inﬂuence of the distribution
of Cr species which is markedly different in the catalysts is also
reﬂected on the selectivity to C3H6 (Fig. 8B). The initial selectivity
to C3H6 is almost 80% on 5Cr–SBA-15 while it is ∼90% on 0.5Cr–
SBA-15 and 1Cr–SBA-15. These results evidenced that isolated Cr
species are more active, selective and stable in the ﬁrst DHP run
than crystalline Cr2O3 particles.
Furthermore, to investigate the behavior of Cr species in the
second DHP run after oxidative treatment at 753 K for 1 h, the

catalysts were regenerated after 120 min on stream (after the ﬁrst
run). Figs. 8C and 8D shows the conversion of C3H8 and selectiv-
ity to C3H6 over these catalysts after ﬁrst oxidative regeneration,
respectively. The initial activity of catalysts 0.5Cr–SBA-15 and 1Cr–
SBA-15 was not completely recovered while that of 5Cr–SBA-15
was more or less completely recovered. On the one hand, it sug-
gests that isolated sites may not be completely regenerated under
these conditions or a fraction of isolated sites might have been
irreversibly deactivated. On the other hand, it suggests that the ac-
cessible Cr sites on the surface of Cr2O3 crystals may almost be
completely regenerated. However, the activity drastically decreased
during on stream for all the catalysts, being more signiﬁcant for
crystals containing 5Cr–SBA-15. This could be due to the rearrange-
ment of the molecular structure of Cr species in the catalysts dur-
ing the reaction and regeneration process. Accordingly, this could
also explain the modiﬁed C3H6 selectivities over the same catalysts
(Fig. 8D) as compared to the ﬁrst run (Fig. 8B).
The catalytic performance of xCr–Al2O3 is shown in Fig. 9. Cat-
alysts 0.5Cr–Al2O3 and 1Cr–Al2O3 contain isolated Cr species be-
sides a fraction of oligomeric species (including dimers), which is
higher in the latter as shown by Raman spectra (Figs. 5a and 5b).
However, the conversion of C3H8 is, in general, comparable over
both the catalysts. Speciﬁcally, 1Cr–Al2O3 shows slightly higher
C3H8 conversion in the initial period than that on 0.5Cr–Al2O3.
As evidenced from the conversion proﬁles, the decrease in the
catalytic activity is nominal during the time on stream. Interest-
ingly, the catalytic activity of 0.5Cr–Al2O3 and 1Cr–Al2O3 is lower
than their counter SBA-15 catalysts and C3H8 conversion did virtu-
ally not increase by increasing the Cr content from 0.5 to 1 wt%,
which is opposite to that observed for the latter catalysts (Fig. 8).
Nonetheless, the selectivity to C3H6 is in general comparable over
these catalysts. The observed differences in the activity of these
two kinds of catalysts can be attributed to the different nature
of Cr species in the catalysts as evidenced by Raman and XANES
(Table 2). Accordingly, it can be suggested that Cr species in Td
coordination stabilized on SBA-15, reﬂected by a Raman band at
982 cm−1, are more active than that of Cr species supported on
Al2O3, reﬂected by a Raman band at 888 cm−1.
By comparing the catalytic activity of 1Cr–Al2O3 and 5Cr–Al2O3,
it is evident that the initial C3H8 conversion is almost ﬁve times
higher on the latter which coincides well with the increased
amount of Cr content. It should be mentioned that unlike 5Cr–
SBA-15, 5Cr–Al2O3 contains both isolated and oligomeric Cr species
but no Cr2O3-like clusters as evidenced by various characterization
results. Accordingly, 5Cr–Al2O3 shows higher activity, selectivity
(Fig. 9B) and stability (as evidenced by a gradual decrease in ac-
tivity) than that of 5Cr–SBA-15, which is dominated by crystalline
Cr2O3 particles. Again it suggests that the function (activity, selec-
tivity and stability) of Cr species is different in the catalysts, which
seems to depend on the nature of the support that has been used
for stabilizing them.
The catalytic performance of the regenerated (after the ﬁrst
run) catalysts in a second DHP run was also studied for xCr–Al2O3.
It can be seen from Figs. 9C and 9D that the initial activity of
the catalysts was not recovered. This is similar to the behavior ob-
served for 0.5Cr–SBA-15 and 1Cr–SBA-15 which exclusively contain
isolated Cr species. The loss of initial activity is severe for 5Cr–
Al2O3 than for catalysts with ⩽1 wt% Cr. By comparison of the
catalytic performances of the regenerated xCr–Al2O3 and xCr–SBA-
15, it can be suggested that oligomeric Cr species are more sensi-
tive to reaction and regeneration processes under which they may
undergo structural changes, as discussed for 5Cr–SBA-15 though, to
different extents. Considering the size of chromium oxide clusters,
it is reasonable to speculate that such a change could signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence the nature of Cr species in smaller oligomers than that
in crystalline Cr2O3. Accordingly, the catalytic activity of Cr species
is inﬂuenced to different degrees in 5Cr–Al2O3 and 5Cr–SBA-15.
Nonetheless, the loss of initial activity of the catalysts in the sec-
ond DHP run could also be due to the deactivation of Cr species
by coke that maybe diﬃcult to remove under these regeneration
conditions. The loss of activity during on stream is faster over the
regenerated 5Cr–Al2O3 than that on fresh catalyst while, it is nom-
inal over fresh and regenerated xCr–Al2O3 catalysts with ⩽1 wt%
Cr. However when the stability of the regenerated 5Cr–Al2O3 and
5Cr–SBA-15 is compared, it is evident that the former shows bet-
ter stability and is similar to the behavior observed for the fresh

catalysts. Selectivity to C3H6 is slightly lower over the regenerated
catalysts than on the fresh catalysts.
Based on the characterization results and catalytic performance
of xCr–SBA-15 and xCr–Al2O3, it can be concluded that the catalytic
activity of Cr species strongly depends on the nature of the support
on which they have been stabilized. Accordingly, Cr species stabi-
lized on SBA-15 as isolated sites in Td coordination are remarkably
more active than their counter parts supported on Al2O3 and on
the surface of crystalline Cr2O3 particles present on SBA-15. Dif-
ferently, oligomeric Cr species anchored on Al2O3 are more active
than isolated Cr species present on the same support. However,
such a comparison of Cr species (isolated vs oligomers) supported
on SBA-15 is not possible in this study due to the lack of Cr–SBA-
15 that contains mainly oligomers like in 5Cr–Al2O3.
3.3. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
The objective of in situ XAS (XANES and EXAFS) studies is to
understand the behavior of Cr species during the DHP on fresh and
regenerated catalysts based on the changes that occur in oxidation
and coordination states of Cr species. To this end, 5 wt% Cr cata-
lysts were selected from the series of xCr–SBA-15 and xCr–Al2O3
and subjected to pre-treatment, reaction (ﬁrst DHP run), regenera-
tion and reaction (second DHP run) at 823 K. The temperature is
comparable to that of steady-state catalysis experiments (853 K) at
which the catalysts have shown substantial DHP activity.
3.3.1. 5Cr–SBA-15
The pre-edge peak in XANES spectra of 5Cr–SBA-15 correspond-
ing to Cr(VI) in Td coordination disappeared, edge (white line) po-
sition shifted towards lower energy and increased in intensity after
DHP for 90 s, as seen by comparison of the spectra of the catalyst
after oxidative pre-treatment (hereafter mentioned as initial spec-
trum) and after DHP for 90 s (Fig. 10). The XANES spectrum does
virtually not change even after 15 min DHP as compared to the
spectrum taken after 90 s (see Fig. 10). From these observations, it
can be concluded that Cr(VI) in Td coordination is reduced within
90 s and the average Cr coordination number is increased (>4,
though a deﬁnitive conclusion on the number cannot be made)
upon contact with C3H8. Similar changes in XANES spectra of Cr-
catalysts were observed upon introduction of either C3H8 or C2H4
on to the oxidized catalysts [16,36]. However, the changes in the
XANES spectra of the catalyst are not completely reversible upon
re-oxidation in a ﬂow of O2/He at the same temperature (823 K)
for 1 h. The intensity of the pre-edge peak is considerably lower
and the white line is slightly higher than in the initial spectrum.
This is an indication of the loss of a fraction of isolated Cr(VI) sites
in Td coordination in favor of Cr(III) in O ct state, perhaps clus-
tered ones, suggesting that structural changes have occurred in Cr

species upon reaction and regeneration. This could explain the al-
tered catalytic properties of regenerated 5Cr–SBA-15 as seen in the
second DHP run as compared to the fresh catalyst in the ﬁrst run
(Fig. 8). Finally, switching back to C3H8/He ﬂow for 1 h (the sec-
ond run) lead to an identical XANES spectrum (not shown for the
sake of clarity) that was observed after 15 min DHP in the ﬁrst run
indicating that similar changes have occurred even after 1 h DHP.
The EXAFS spectra (k2-weighted FT and non-phase shift cor-
rected) of 5Cr–SBA-15 before and after 1 h DHP in the second run
are shown in Fig. 11. By comparison of the spectra, it is evident
that major changes have occurred after the reaction. The inten-
sity of the main peak located at 1.64 Å is signiﬁcantly increased
and a shoulder emerged at 1.34 Å. Also, the peaks in the sec-
ond and third coordination shells grew in intensity as compared
to the peaks observed in the spectrum of the fresh catalyst (be-
fore the reaction) (Fig. 11). Considering the XANES results, isolated
Cr(VI) species in Td coordination are reduced which in turn lead
to a lower oxidation state (mostly, III) and hence, increased Cr–O
bond distances can be expected due to the large ionic radius of
the reduced Cr atoms than that of Cr(VI). Therefore, in the EXAFS
spectrum the shoulder at 1.34 Å is not expected which indicates
short Cr–X (X = O or C) bond nature (perhaps, double bond like
in Td coordination). In fact such a peak attributable to Cr–O bond
decreased after reduction of Cr–Al2O3 by H2 as reported in [14].
Similarly, the dramatic increase in intensity of the main peak at
1.64 Å is due to the increase in average coordination number in
Cr coordination sphere. This could be either by ligation of C atoms
126

of coke with Cr species [36] or by severe aggregation [16]. As evi-
denced by other characterization techniques, the catalyst is already
dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, hence it is unlikely
that the formation of additional clusters or structural rearrange-
ment of Cr species could increase the intensity of the peak to such
an extent. For instance, a study [14] reported the structural rear-
rangement of surface Cr species into more crystalline aggregates
upon reduction of a typical industrial like Cr–Al2O3 (13 wt% Cr)
with H2 in which the intensity of the peaks arising from ﬁrst and
second shell contributions is virtually the same. Conversely, it is
well known that carbon deposits can readily form during DHP [11,
17,18], which could lead to the formation of Cr–C bonds on a coked
catalyst. It should be noted that the EXAFS spectrum was recorded
at room temperature in He ﬂow after 1 h DHP at 823 K. Thus, the
increase in the coordination number of the reduced Cr species is
likely due to coke, as also evidenced by the increased white line
in in situ XANES spectra taken during DHP. Furthermore, a recent
study on Philips catalyst by XAS showed that upon introduction
of C2H4 on to an oxidized catalyst lead to a huge increase in the
intensity of white line (in XANES) and of the peaks correspond-
ing to ﬁrst and second coordination shells (in EXAFS) [36]. These
observations were attributed to coke rather than aggregation or
rearrangement of surface Cr species. It is noteworthy that EXAFS
cannot distinguish between Cr–O and Cr–C bonds in the ﬁrst co-
ordination shell [36]. Therefore, the observed spectral changes in
our study are mostly due to the formation of coke however, a con-
tribution from structural rearrangement of surface Cr species into
more crystalline particles during DHP cannot be ruled out.
3.3.2. 5Cr–Al2O3
As shown in Fig. 10, the changes in XANES spectra of 5Cr–Al2O3
are similar to those observed for 5Cr–SBA-15 after the ﬁrst and
second DHP runs. In both the runs, pre-edge peak vanished and
position of the edge shifted towards lower energy and the intensity
of the white line is considerably higher than in the initial spec-
trum. Interestingly, the intensity of the white line is slightly higher
than that observed for 5Cr–SBA-15. Regeneration between the two
DHP runs did not completely restore the initial XANES spectrum.
However, signiﬁcantly the isolated Cr species are more or less com-
pletely restored as evidenced by the pre-edge peak, which is quite
different from 5Cr–SBA-15 in which a fraction of isolated Cr species
were lost in favor of clusters. Furthermore, the intensity of the
white line is signiﬁcantly higher in the regenerated spectrum than
in the initial and in the regenerated spectrum of 5Cr–SBA-15. This
indicates a signiﬁcant increase in the coordination number of Cr
species while retaining almost all isolated Cr sites in the cata-
lysts after regeneration which in turn suggests that oligomeric Cr
species are more sensitive to reaction and regeneration processes
than the isolated Cr sites and Cr sites on the surface of Cr2O3 crys-
tals in 5Cr–SBA-15. Therefore, it can be proposed that oligomers
have aggregated, to some extent, into larger clusters during the re-
action and regeneration implying altered nature and distribution of
Cr species in the catalyst. This is in excellent agreement with the
catalytic data that show dramatic drop in the initial DHP activity
(in the second DHP run) of the catalyst after regeneration (Fig. 9).
These results conﬁrm that small oligomeric Cr species supported
on γ -Al2O3 are more active than isolated Cr sites and large oxide
clusters.
The corresponding k2-weighted FT-EXAFS spectra (non-phase
shift corrected) of 5Cr–Al2O3 before and after 1 h DHP in the sec-
ond run are compared in Fig. 11. Signiﬁcant changes can be seen
in the spectrum after the reaction. The intensity of the main peak
centered at 1.64 Å increased signiﬁcantly, which is slightly higher
in intensity than that observed for 5Cr–SBA-15, and the shoulder
at 1.34 Å disappeared. Additionally new peaks, with respect to the
main peak, appeared at shorter (1.16 Å) and larger distances (2.07,
2.38, 2.75, 3.31 and 3.72 Å), which were not observed in the ini-
tial spectrum. As evidenced by other characterization results, the
fresh 5Cr–Al2O3 catalyst contains highly dispersed Cr species and
no detectable Cr oxide clusters. Furthermore, it should be noted
that support γ -Al2O3 is more acidic than SBA-15 [38] which, is
highly favorable for coke formation [11,17,18]. Based on this, the
peak at 1.16 Å (indicating the short double bond nature), the dra-
matic increase in the intensity of the main peak at 1.64 Å and
signiﬁcant contributions from higher coordination shells (>2 Å)
are highly likely due to the linking of C atoms (in coke) with Cr
species that increases the average coordination number of Cr sites.
However, formation of chromium oxide clusters during DHP cannot
be ruled out, as claimed in [16]. Any attempt to derive quantitative
data under such a scenario could lead to a biased spectral analy-
sis hence, quantitative data derived from these EXAFS spectra are
neither presented nor discussed.
4. Relationship between the structure and catalytic function of
Cr species
Characterization of xCr–SBA-15 and xCr–Al2O3 by various tech-
niques revealed that the nature and distribution of Cr species
(monomers, oligomers and crystalline Cr2O3 particles) is a func-
tion of the support. It also depends on the Cr loading on a given
support. At low Cr content (⩽1 wt% Cr), exclusively isolated Cr
species in Td coordination are formed on SBA-15 while oligomeric
species besides isolated sites are formed on Al2O3. However, the
nature of Cr species on both the supports is different as evidenced
by Raman and XANES. At high Cr content (⩾5 wt% Cr), these iso-
lated Cr species decreased in favor of clusters and the size of which
is determined by the kind of support employed. Crystalline Cr2O3
particles are exclusively formed at the external surface of SBA-15.
In contrast, oligomeric species, with different degrees of oligomer-
ization, are formed within the pore of Al2O3 and no Cr2O3 like
particles are formed as concluded from XRD, STEM, Raman and
XAS.
In situ XANES studies show that Cr is in highly oxidized state
after oxidative pre-treatment in 5Cr–SBA-15 and 5Cr–Al2O3. Under
DHP conditions, isolated Cr(VI) species in Td coordination are re-
duced to (III) and the coordination number increases (>4) within
90 s DHP, as evidenced by the disappearance of pre-edge peak, the
red shift in the edge position and increased intensity of the white
line. However, from this it cannot be explicitly stated whether
isolated Cr sites remain isolated or agglomerate due to the con-
tribution of C atoms (coke) to Cr coordination. Nonetheless, most
of the Cr is present as Cr(III) species under DHP conditions, in good
agreement with previous reports on DHP and on similar reactions
[11,13,15,16,22]. In agreement with in situ XAS studies, total com-
bustion of C3H8 during the initial period of DHP was observed over
all these catalysts (xCr–SBA-15 and xCr–Al2O3) before reaching a
steady-state. This indicates that the high oxidation state or the ini-
tial state of Cr is responsible for this detrimental reaction but when
Cr is reduced or partly deactivated by coke with time it selectively
catalyzes DHP.
As far as isolated Cr species are concerned, it is reasonable
to say that active DHP sites are generated during the reaction,
the origin of which are Cr(VI) species in Td coordination reﬂected
by the pre-edge peak in XANES. This is shown schematically, as
a representation of the generation of active DHP site, in Fig. 12.
However, it is noteworthy that the intrinsic activity of isolated Cr
species supported on SBA-15 and Al2O3 is markedly different as
evidenced by the catalytic activity of 1Cr–SBA-15 and 1Cr–Al2O3
(Figs. 8 and 9). The turnover frequencies (TOFs), which were cal-
culated for the amount of initial propylene production according
to the method reported in [22], for 1Cr–SBA-15 and 1Cr–Al2O3
were determined to be 0.03 and 0.01 (s−1), respectively. This indi-

Fig. 12. Schematic mechanism of the structure of active Cr site generation during
DHP at 853 K: (a) isolated Cr(VI)O4 in Td coordination (anchored to the support)
after oxidative pre-treatments (see Section 2) and (b) generation of active DHP site
after interaction with C3H8–Cr(III)OxCy. It should be noted that the number and
nature of coordinating ligands in active DHP site is not conclusive from XAS (see
Section 4) hence it should be treated as a virtual site.
cates that isolated Cr species anchored on the support SBA-15 are
more active than those supported on Al2O3. The observed TOFs are
smaller than those reported (0.1 mol s−1 mol Cr-atom−1) for ethy-
lene formation on Cr/H-ZSM-5 in ODHE [22] conﬁrming that the
nature of support determines the degree of Cr site activity. How-
ever, it should be noted that the amount of Cr in the zeolites was
higher and conditions employed for the catalytic tests were dif-
ferent. From catalytic data of xCr–SBA-15, it also appeared that
besides isolated Cr sites, accessible Cr sites on the surface of crys-
talline Cr2O3 particles also participate in DHP but to a different
extent.
By comparing the characterization results and catalytic data
of xCr–Al2O3, it is evident that oligomeric Cr species are much
more active than isolated Cr sites. The generation of selectively
active DHP oligomeric Cr sites may also proceed in a similar
way as schematically shown for isolated sites in Fig. 12. However,
oligomeric Cr species are more sensitive to regeneration process
than isolated Cr and Cr sites on the surface of Cr2O3 crystals
as evidenced by in situ XANES and also as reﬂected by the cat-
alytic performance of xCr–SBA-15 and xCr–Al2O3 in the second
DHP run (Figs. 8 and 9). This is in line with previous studies on
supported Cr catalysts that conclude that oligomeric Cr is easily
reducible than isolated Cr due to different degrees of interactions
between the support and Cr species [14,54]. Therefore, it can be
suggested that oligomeric species observed on xCr–Al2O3 undergo
structural rearrangement during the reaction and regeneration pro-
cesses which could ultimately alter the nature and distribution of
Cr species and hence the catalytic performance (Fig. 9). Accord-
ingly, this explains the altered catalytic performance of regenerated
xCr–SBA-15 and xCr–Al2O3 in the second DHP run. From this it also
appears that the rearrangement of Cr species in oligomers com-
pared to that in crystals has a greater inﬂuence on the catalytic
property. The results clearly demonstrate that the nature and thus
the degree of catalytic activity of active Cr sites in DHP certainly
depend on the nature of the catalyst support. This could be one
of the reasons for the controversy on the nature of active Cr sites,
often compared between different Cr catalysts, in dehydrogenation
of alkanes [11,12,15,16,34,53]. The ﬁnding has a signiﬁcant implica-
tion on the catalytic performance and hence on the development
of DHP catalysts. Therefore, the study could be used as a guide to
tune active site structure and hence to design rational catalysts for
DHP as well as for similar dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.
5. Conclusions
To gain a better understanding of the structure and catalytic
function of Cr species, a series of xCr–SBA-15 and xCr–Al2O3 cat-
alysts with different nature and distribution of Cr species were
prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, analyzed by various
characterization techniques ex situ (N2-physisorption, XRD, UV-
Raman spectroscopy, STEM–EDXS, XANES and EXAFS) and in situ
(XANES and EXAFS) and tested in DHP. Based on the results, the
following main conclusions can be drawn:
• At ⩽1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains merely isolated Cr(VI) species
in Td coordination whereas γ -Al2O3 contains, besides isolated
sites, a fraction of oligomers (including dimers).
• At ⩾5 wt% Cr, besides a fraction of monomers, crystalline α-
Cr2O3 particles are mainly formed on SBA-15 while, remark-
ably such crystals are not formed rather oligomers with differ-
ent degrees of nuclearity are mainly formed on γ -Al2O3.
• In situ XANES studies evidence that isolated Cr(VI) species in
Td coordination are immediately reduced to Cr(III) and their
coordination number increased (>4) upon interaction with
C3H8, the latter is also evidenced by in situ EXAFS.
• The
intrinsic
catalytic
activity
of
Cr
species
(isolated
or
oligomers) depends on the support (SBA-15 or Al2O3) where
they have been stabilized as evidenced by the catalytic results.
• In xCr–SBA-15, isolated Cr(III) species with coordination num-
ber greater than four are more active, selective and stable
than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast,
oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than iso-
lated Cr species stabilized on xCr–Al2O3 for DHP. However,
the former species are less stable against regeneration than
the latter as evidenced from the second DHP run and in situ
XANES.
