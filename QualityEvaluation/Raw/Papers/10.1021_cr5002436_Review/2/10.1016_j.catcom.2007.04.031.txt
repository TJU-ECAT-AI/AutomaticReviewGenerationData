Abstract
Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane into ethylene at 700 C over reductively pretreated Cr–Mg–Al and Cr–Mg mixed oxide
catalysts has been studied. The catalysts were prepared from layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors that contained various species
of chromium (i.e., cationic Cr(III), complex of Cr(III) with an anionic chelating agent, and chromate anion). Synthesized materials were
characterized with powder X-ray diﬀraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy techniques. It was shown that
the surface area of the LDH-derived mixed oxides, their catalytic performance, coking ability, and susceptibility to sintering were highly
dependent on the method used for introducing chromium into the LDH precursors of the catalysts.

1. Introduction
Production of light alkenes from C2–C4 saturated
hydrocarbon feedstock via dehydrogenation reaction is
of high practical importance [1]. The catalysts most fre-
quently used in industry for this reaction are alumina-
supported chromia [2,3]. The oxides of molybdenum,
vanadium and some other metals on high surface area
supports were also reported as catalysts for this reaction
[4–8]. Recently, we have observed that non-oxidative
dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene could be eﬀec-
tively performed over various transition metal catalysts
supported on Mg–Al mixed oxide [9]. The catalysts were
prepared from layered double hydroxide precursors syn-
thesized by conventional coprecipitation of metal cations
under basic conditions [10,11]. It was found that among
all tested catalysts the chromium-containing material
demonstrated
the
most
attractive
catalytic
behavior
showing ethane conversion markedly higher than with
other catalysts, considerably high selectivity to ethylene,
and low coking ability.
In the present work, we explore what kind of inﬂu-
ence may the catalysts prepared from various precursor
compounds of chromium have on the reaction of non-
oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH). The results
of characterization for LDH precursors of catalysts and
mixed
oxides
by
powder
X-ray
diﬀraction
(XRD),
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman
spectroscopy techniques are discussed. The catalytic tests
for the EDH to ethylene over the LDH-derived mixed
metal oxides were carried out at 700 C. At this temper-
ature the equilibrium conversion of ethane was calculated
to be 60%. The reaction was monitored for ethane and
ethylene content in the post-reactor gas stream by on-line
gas chromatography, and the amounts of coke deposited
onto the catalysts after the test reaction were evaluated
by
temperature-programmed
oxidation
with
carbon
dioxide.

2. Experimental
The nitrates of Mg(II), Al(III), and Cr(III), ammonium
chromate, and sodium carbonate and hydroxide were pur-
chased from Aldrich. Tetrasodium salt of ethylenediamine-
tetraacetic acid (i.e., Na4(edta)) was received from TCI
America. All compounds were of reagent grade and were
used without additional puriﬁcation treatment. Distilled,
deionized, and degassed water was used throughout this
work. All gases were of ultra high purity (99.999%) and
used as received from Praxair.
Conventional synthesis of LDH by coprecipitation of
metal cations under basic conditions (Fig. 1a) was carried
out as follows. The solution of sodium carbonate in water
(250 cm3) was poured into a 3-neck, round-bottom reaction
ﬂask of 1000 cm3 capacity and heated to 65 C. The
nitrates of Mg(II), Al(III) and/or Cr(III) in the amounts
needed (Table 1) were placed into a conical ﬂask and dis-
solved in 100 cm3 of water. The solution thus obtained
was added dropwise to a pre-heated Na2CO3 solution
under vigorous stirring. The pH of the formed slurry was
kept at 10.0 by adding a 1.0 mol L1 NaOH solution. After
complete addition of the metal nitrate solution, the suspen-
sion was kept at 65 C under stirring for 1 h and then left
for ageing at the same temperature for 18 h without stir-
ring. Thus the solids, referred to as A-1 to A-4, were syn-
thesized
(Table
1).
Another
method
of
introducing
chromium into LDH is shown in Fig. 1b. It was based
on the ability of Cr(III) to form a chelate of 1:1 stoichiom-
etry with (edta)4 that was much more stable thermody-
namically
than
that
of
Mg(II)
or
Al(III)
[12].
Chromium(III) nitrate and Na4(edta) taken in equimolar
amounts were placed into the 3-neck reaction ﬂask,
200 cm3 of water was added upon stirring, and the solution
pH was adjusted to 10.5 by adding NaOH. The solution
was heated to 65 C in order to completely convert Cr(III)
into Cr(edta) complex [13]. Then Mg(II) and Al(III) were
added dropwise to the pre-chelated chromium(III) while
keeping the pH of the slurry at 10.5 by addition of NaOH.
By this technique, the B-1 sample was prepared (Table 1).
The third approach of synthesizing Cr-containing LDH
involved coprecipitation of Mg(II) and Al(III) with chro-
mate anions present in the solution in slight excess to that
required by stoichiometry (Fig. 1c). The sample synthesized
by this technique was denoted as C-1 (Table 1). For refer-
ence, synthetic hydrotalcite [Mg6Al2(OH)16]CO3 (i.e., sam-
ple
A-Ref)
was
also
prepared
by
conventional
coprecipitation of Mg(II) and Al(III) with carbonate coun-
ter-ion under basic conditions. All the synthesized materi-
als were separated from the solutions by centrifuging at
2800 rpm speed for 5 min and were rinsed with three
500 cm3 portions of water. After drying in air at 90 C
for 48 h, the solid materials were ground to sieve a 250–
425 lm fraction of particles that were collected separately
and further calcined in air at 500 C for 16 h to produce
Cr–Mg–Al and Cr–Mg mixed oxides to be used for cata-
lytic tests (Table 1). All samples were stored in a desiccator
at room temperature under vacuum.
Powder XRD patterns of all synthesized materials were
recorded under air at room temperature using a Philips
Fig. 1. Synthetic strategies applied for preparing layered double hydroxide precursors of chromium catalysts: (a) conventional coprecipitation of metal
cations with carbonate counter-ion under basic conditions; (b) coprecipitation of Mg(II) and Al(III) with a pre-synthesized edta chelate of Cr(III); and (c)
coprecipitation of Mg(II) and Al(III) with CrO2

PW3020 diﬀractometer with a Cu Ka radiation source (k
1.54056 A
˚ ) at 45 kV voltage and 40 mA current. The pat-
terns were acquired for 2H range of 3–80 with a
0.033 s1 scan speed. The metal contents in Cr–Mg–Al
and Cr–Mg mixed oxides were obtained by X-ray ﬂuores-
cence (XRF) using a Philips PW2400 spectrometer previ-
ously calibrated for those elements using a concentration
gradient of ultra-high purity oxides. Raman spectra of
materials were collected with a HORIBA Jobin Yvon Lab-
Ram-IR HR800 system [14]. The powdered samples were
irradiated with an Ar-ion laser light (k 514.532 nm), and
the backscattered radiation was collected through a 100·
objective lens with an 0.9 numerical aperture, a speciﬁc
notch ﬁlter for the rejection of the exciting line, a 200 lm
spectrograph entrance slit, and then was detected by a
CCD camera. A grating with 1800 grooves per mm was
used for high-resolution measurements. The spectra were
acquired for a 200–4000 cm1 range with an integration
time of 10 cycles by 5 s each. XPS was performed using a
Specs GmbH system (XR50 X-ray source plus Phoibos
100 SCD analyzer) on hydraulically pressed pellets of
A-1, A-3, A-4, B-1, and C-1 mixed oxide samples. Survey
spectra in the binding energy range of 1100–1 eV with a
step size of 0.2 eV and a dwell time of 0.8 s per step were
performed in a multi-technique UHV chamber of base
pressure 1013 bar. The pass energy was 10 eV yielding a
resolution of 0.5 eV. Quantiﬁcation was performed using
Casa XPS commercial software to ﬁt the peaks (O 1s,
Mg 2s, C 1s, Cr 2p, Al 2s) after background subtraction
(Shirley) to a mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian proﬁle. The
areas of the peaks were divided by the corresponding rela-
tive sensitivity factors from the Scoﬁeld library to yield
atomic % ratios of surface elements. Due to the electrically
insulating nature of the samples, charging was observed
and therefore the binding energy scale was calibrated by
setting the adventitious carbon 1s peak to 284.4 eV. Higher
resolution section scans of the Cr 2p peaks were taken with
0.1 eV steps and 5 s dwell in order to better observe and
quantify the peak splitting due to the co-existence of the
Cr3+ and Cr6+ oxidation states in each sample.
Nitrogen adsorption measurements were performed at
(196) C using a Coulter Omnisorp 100 apparatus. Before
exposure to nitrogen, the mixed metal oxide samples were
heated to 300 C for 4 h under high vacuum (1.33 · 108
bar). The speciﬁc surface area (SBET) was determined from
the linear part of the BET plot (P/P0 = 0.05–0.25).
For testing catalytic activity, the mixed metal oxide
(500 mg) was loaded into a U-shape quartz tube reactor
(8 mm ID) equipped with a coaxially aligned, internally
positioned, narrow quartz well for a thermocouple to mea-
sure the catalyst temperature. Under a 50 cm3 min1 ﬂow
of nitrogen, the reactor was heated to 700 C at atmo-
spheric pressure. Then hydrogen (20 cm3 min1) was added
to the gas stream. After this reductive activation treatment
at 700 C for 20 min, the catalyst was purged by pure nitro-
gen
with
the
same
ﬂow
rate
for
10 min.
Ethane
(20 cm3 min1) was then added to the nitrogen feed, and
the catalytic EDH reaction started at atmospheric pressure.
After 5 h, the ﬂow of ethane was stopped, and the reactor
was cooled to room temperature under ﬂowing N2. Quan-
titative analysis for ethane and ethylene, which was found
to be the only reaction product, was carried out on-line by
using an Agilent Technologies 6890 N gas chromatograph
(GC) equipped with an automated sampling valve, a
500 lL sampling loop, a GS-GasPro PLOT capillary col-
umn (60 m · 0.32 mm ID) and a thermal conductivity
detector (TCD). To quantify the amount of coke that
was deposited onto each catalyst during the ethane dehy-
drogenation reaction, the spent catalysts were subjected
to temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) with pure

used catalysts were heated from room temperature to
940 C with a 2 C min1 rate and kept at 940 C for 1 h.
The post-reactor eﬄuent gas stream was monitored for car-
bon monoxide product by on-line GC–TCD. After holding
the reactor temperature at 940 C for 1 h, CO2 ﬂow was
replaced with nitrogen (10 cm3 min1), and the reactor
was cooled to room temperature. The total amount of coke
was calculated in g of carbon per g of initial catalyst on the
basis of CO quantity formed during TPO and measured by
GC–TCD.
3. Results and discussion
The powder XRD patterns of the synthesized materials
are shown in Fig. 2. All samples had a layered structure
very similar to that of the reference hydrotaclite (pattern
G)
demonstrating
a
set
of
characteristic
peaks
at
2H = 11.3, 22.8, 34.4, and 60.5 that corresponded to
reﬂections from [003], [006], [009], and [110] planes. An
increase in chromium content from about 11 at.% (sample
A-1) to 22 at.% (A-2) did not bring about any changes in
position of XRD peaks but resulted in the formation of less
crystallized material as less intense X-ray reﬂections were
detected. Magnesium(II) hydroxide phase was also identi-
ﬁed in the samples A-3 and A-4 prepared by coprecipita-
tion of Mg and Cr with carbonate counter-ion: one can
see for patterns C and D a sharp, relatively intense reﬂec-
tion at 2H = 18.6 that corresponds to a d-spacing of
4.75 A
˚ typical of Mg(OH)2 brucite phase. This indicates
that the presence of aluminum is crucially important for
the formation of a pure LDH phase, without segregation
of any other XRD-detectable phase. No peaks correspond-
ing to a d-spacing larger than that of the reference hydro-
taclite
(i.e.,
7.8 A
˚ ) were detected
for
a B-1 sample
(pattern E) that contained chromium pre-chelated with
edta. This suggests that the Cr(edta) species were located
at the external surface of the LDH crystallites (Fig. 1b) and
did not intercalate the intergallery space of LDH as it was
observed for Ni(edta)2 and Cu(edta)2 chelates in our
previous studies [15]. Comparison of XRD pattern for
the reference hydrotalcite (G) with that of the LDH con-
taining CrO2
4
species (F) clearly indicates that the phase
with a larger d-spacing (i.e., 8.4 A
˚ ) was formed upon copre-
cipitation of Mg(II) and Al(III) with chromate counter-ion.
This indicates that intercalation of the LDH with chromate
anions took place resulting in an increase of the interlayer
distance from 3 A
˚ for the reference hydrotalcite to 3.6 A
˚
for the C-1 LDH, which is in agreement with values
reported in the literature [16,17].
The results of Raman spectroscopy studies of the syn-
thesized LDHs are given in Fig. 3 and Table 2. In all spec-
tra, one can observe two peaks around 460–470 and
550 cm1 due to ‘‘Al/Mg’’–OH translational vibrations
and two peaks at 1040 and 1060 cm1 that were due to
symmetric stretching vibrations (m1) of NO
3 and CO2
3 pro-
ducing the most intense Raman bands [18]. Two more
peaks around 840 and 880 cm1 appeared in the spectra
of the A-2 and A-4 materials containing chromium intro-
duced
by
the
traditional
coprecipitation
technique
(Fig. 1a). These peaks can be assigned to the symmetric
stretching vibrations of the nitrate and carbonate anions
distorted by interaction with hydroxyl groups bound to
chromium(III) that ought to result in a lowering of the
anion symmetry from D3h (as of a free anion) to probably
C2v [18]. The Raman spectrum of the B-1 LDH revealed all

the features characteristic of the (edta)-chelated chro-
mium(III) (Fig. 3b) which consist of a peak at 460 cm1
due to stretching of two N–Cr coordination bonds, a peak
at 922 cm1 due to stretching of four C–C bonds (i.e.,
CH2–COO),
and
few
overlapping
peaks
around
2900 cm1 due to symmetric and antisymmetric C–H
stretching vibrations of six CH2-groups of the edta chelate
[15]. The presence of CrO2
4
in the structure of the C-1
LDH
was
conﬁrmed
by
Raman
technique
as
well
(Fig. 3c): one can see in the spectrum all four kinds of
vibration bands typical of the chromate anion that has a
tetrahedral symmetry, the band at 847 cm1 being the most
intense as it corresponds to the totally symmetric ‘‘breath-
ing’’ vibration (m1) [19].
Calcination of LDHs in air at 500 C completely
destroyed the layered structure of the materials converting
them into amorphous mixed metal oxides. Table 1 shows
that the chromium content in the mixed oxides is strongly
dependent on the method of LDH synthesis. Conventional
coprecipitation resulted in a total incorporation of chro-
mium into the LDHs, and the stoichiometry for metals in
the derived mixed oxides was found to be almost identical
to that of the initial mixture of cations. For the Cr–Mg–Al
mixed oxide derived from the LDH synthesized via pre-
chelation of Cr(III) with edta, the XRF elemental analysis
revealed only a partial incorporation of chromium. When
the chromate anion was used as the chromium source,
the resultant mixed oxide contained only half of the
amount allowable by the reaction stoichiometry. One can
here assume that in order to balance the positive charge
of the bricute-like layers, the LDHs B-1 and C-1 must have
contained OH anions, located in the intergallery space of
the LDHs as it was found for the naturally occurring min-
eral of meixnerite [Mg6Al2(OH)16](OH)2, and carbonate
anions originated from CO2 in air.
Results of quantiﬁcation of relevant elements in the
samples by XPS are given in Table 1. The atomic ratios
of samples A-1, B-1, and C-1 compare well to their bulk
values as determined by XRF. However, when considering
samples A-3 and A-4, Mg surface enrichment of 5.6% and
10.1%, respectively, is seen. This indicates the segregation
of Mg to the surface at the expense of Cr. This observation
correlates with the XRD data for the LDH samples where
a separate Mg(OH)2 phase was observed. In the absence of
aluminum to stabilize the system, not only will Mg(II) sep-
arate from the main phase, but it will segregate to the sur-
face as MgO upon calcination of the LDHs.
XPS-Spectra show a sample free of contaminants except
for adventitious carbon. Splitting of the chromium 2p 3/2
peaks was clearly visible in all samples with the exception
of B-1, which lacked suﬃcient Cr to resolve any splitting.
The Cr chemical shift is attributed to the presence of the
Cr3+ and Cr6+ with an average chemical shift of all samples
being 3.0 ± 0.1 eV [20,21]. Quantiﬁcation of the Cr 2p
peaks was performed using both the spin 1/2 and 3/2 peaks
of the 2p doublet and a combined 2p RSF. In this manner
shakeup peaks common in ﬁrst row transition metals were
included in the quantiﬁcation [22]. The ratios of Cr+6/Cr+3
were 1.7, 2.9, 2.6 and 4.3 for [A-1]Cr/MgAlOX, [C-1]Cr/
MgAlOX, [A-3]Cr/MgOX and [A-4]Cr/MgOX, respectively.
The surface area of Cr–Mg–Al and Cr–Mg mixed oxides
was also found to be dependent on the method of LDH
synthesis. The highest values for surface area were obtained

with [A-1]Cr/MgAlOX and [B-1]Cr/MgAlOX catalysts (194
and 204 m2 g1). Increasing chromium content from about
11 at.% for the sample A-1 to 22% for the A-2 while simul-
taneously decreasing the content of aluminum resulted in
reduction of surface area to 144 m2 g1. The mixed oxide
derived from the LDH bearing chromate anion (i.e., C-1)
exhibited almost the same surface area as the Mg–Al mixed
oxide derived from the reference hydrotalcite A-Ref (157
vs. 161 m2 g1). One should add that the smallest surface
area values were obtained for the mixed oxides that did
not contain aluminum, and an increase in chromium con-
tent led to a considerable reduction in surface area for
the Cr–Mg mixed oxide.
The results of catalytic activity tests for Cr-containing
mixed oxides are summarized in Fig. 4. For all catalysts,
we observed a gradual decrease in activity during the 5 h
tests due to catalyst deactivation that was most substantial
during the ﬁrst hour of time-on-stream. The catalysts
[A-1]Cr/MgAlOX and [B-1]Cr/MgAlOX revealed the best per-
formance in the EDH reaction showing ethane conversions
close to 30% with selectivity to ethylene about 71%. One
should here emphasize that chromium content for the cat-
alyst [B-1]Cr/MgAlOX was nearly three times lower than
that for the catalyst [A-1]Cr/MgAlOX but the surface areas
of the catalysts were very close. The results obtained with
the catalyst derived from the CrO2
4 -containing LDH
(i.e.,
[C-1]Cr/MgAlOX) appeared also attractive, as 27%
conversion of ethane and almost 74% selectivity to ethylene
were attained with that catalyst. Notably higher selectivity
to ethylene (80%) was observed with the Cr/MgO catalysts
and particularly with the [A-2]Cr/MgAlOX catalyst. How-
ever, ethane conversion over these catalysts remained
rather low and was even lower than that attained with
the chromium-free [A-Ref]MgAlOX catalyst.
The ability of supported catalysts to resist deactivation
due to coke deposition, which is typical of non-oxidative
hydrocarbon conversion, is another signiﬁcant criterion
determining the suitability of a catalyst for potential indus-
trial applications. In order to evaluate how much coke was
produced on the catalyst surface during the ethane dehy-
drogenation reaction, the spent chromium-containing cata-
lysts were subjected to temperature-programmed oxidation
using carbon dioxide as the oxidizing agent. An advantage
of using CO2 instead of O2 is seen from the comparison of
the reaction stoichiometries:
Ccoke þ O2 ¢ CO2
ðReaction 1Þ
Ccoke þ CO2 ¢ 2CO
ðReaction 2Þ
For the reaction 2, two molecules of CO are produced
per carbon atom of coke. So, with the same analytical
GC–TCD technique, one may obtain more accurate mea-
surements of the amount of carbon, which is particularly

signiﬁcant for measuring small amounts of deposited coke.
The thermal behavior of coke, deposited during the EDH
reaction onto MgAlOX- and MgO-supported chromium
catalysts, against TPO with CO2 is presented in Fig. 5.
All coke formed was completely removed from the cata-
lysts due to such oxidative treatment. The highest CO for-
mation rates for most of the catalysts were observed at
temperatures ranging from 800 to 860 C with the excep-
tion of the [B-1]Cr/MgAlOX catalyst that showed a broad
proﬁle for TPO of coke with the maximum rate of CO for-
mation at 920 C. On the basis of these results, the total
amount of deposited coke was estimated, and the data ob-
tained are given in Table 3. The MgO-supported chromium
catalysts revealed a much lower coking ability than that of
chromium-free Mg–Al mixed oxide. The most heavily
coked catalyst was found to be the [B-1]Cr/MgAlOX which
was prepared from Cr(edta)-containing LDH. The amount
of coke formed over other MgAlOX-supported chromium
catalysts ranged from 12.9 wt% for
[A-2]Cr/MgAlOX to
21.4 wt% for [A-1]Cr/MgAlOX catalyst.
To evaluate the stability of the LDH-derived catalysts,
we measured their surface area after exposure to the
EDH reaction and TPO of deposited coke, and the val-
ues obtained were compared with those of freshly cal-
cined mixed oxides that are given in Table 1. The
results of comparison are summarized in Table 4. One
can see that MgO–supported chromium catalysts experi-
enced the severest sintering with more than 70% reduc-
tion in surface area after the EDH and TPO reactions.
Sintering with about 50% decrease in surface area was
found for the [A-2]Cr/MgAlOX and [B-1]Cr/MgAlOX cata-
lysts. The catalyst prepared from CrO2
4 -containing LDH
precursor
(i.e.,
[C-1]Cr/MgAlOX)
revealed
only
34%
decrease in surface area due to sintering. The most stable
catalyst against sintering was found to be the chromium-
free
mixed
oxide
[A-Ref]MgAlOX
whose
surface
area
reduced from 161 m2 g1 to 134 m2 g1 (i.e., by 17%)
after exposure to the EDH and TPO reactions. These
results
clearly
indicate
that
thermal
stability
of
the
LDH-derived mixed metal oxide catalysts depends signif-
icantly on the method used for synthesizing LDH precur-
sors of catalysts. The stabilizing role of aluminum when
present
in
the
mixed
oxides
appeared
particularly
remarkable.

In summary, the reductively pretreated Cr–Mg–Al and
Cr–Mg mixed oxides derived from the LDH precursors
were tested for catalysis of non-oxidative dehydrogenation
of ethane into ethylene at 700 C. It was found that the sur-
face area of the mixed oxides, their catalytic performance,
coking ability, and thermal stability against sintering were
inﬂuenced considerably by the method used for introducing
chromium into the LDH precursors of the catalysts.
