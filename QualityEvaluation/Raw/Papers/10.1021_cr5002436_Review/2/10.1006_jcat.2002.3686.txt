Irreversible deactivation of chromia/alumina dehydrogenation
catalysts was investigated by deactivating the catalysts (4 wt% Cr)
through prolonged calcination in air at temperatures up to
1200◦C. Nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction, diffuse re-
ﬂectance spectroscopy in the UV–visible region, X-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and cata-
lytic measurements revealed that two deactivation mechanisms
were responsible for the formation of catalytically inactive alumina-
incorporated Cr3+ species: (i) entrapment of Cr3+ ions inside the
alumina support during sintering of the alumina support and
(ii) migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina support. Chromia that
had been impregnated on alumina inhibited the phase transforma-
tion from γ- to α-alumina. The presence of γ-alumina, in turn,
hindered the migration of Cr3+ ions into alumina. The turnover
frequency was higher for multinuclear Cr3+ than for isolated Cr3+
sites. The phase of the alumina support did not appear to affect the
activity of the surface Cr3+ species.

INTRODUCTION
The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is of great im-
portance as an effective route for the production of propene
and other light alkenes (1–4). Chromia/alumina catalysts
are industrially used for this process, and much recent re-
search has been devoted to elucidating the structures of
alumina-supported chromium oxide (5–24). Despite these
efforts, there is no consensus on the origin of the catalytic
activity or on the deactivation mechanisms. In the following
we ﬁrst summarize qualitatively the structures of chromium
known to be present in chromia/alumina catalysts and then
we deﬁne some unanswered questions regarding this com-
plex catalyst system.

Oxidized chromia/alumina catalysts contain chromium
in oxidation states Cr6+, Cr5+, and Cr3+ (5–23). Cr6+ and
Cr5+ are reduced by alkanes, hydrogen, and carbon monox-
ide under typical dehydrogenation conditions (500–600◦C)
(5–8, 10–13, 16, 19, 21, 23). Oxidation state Cr3+ has most
often been proposed as the state existing after reduction
(5–8, 10–13, 16, 19, 21, 23); some Cr5+ may remain after
reduction with hydrogen (25) and part of the chromium
may reduce to Cr2+ (13). Figure 1a shows one way of clas-
sifying the different types of Cr3+ species that are present
in reduced chromia/alumina catalysts. Type 1 sites are sur-
face Cr3+ sites, with subclasses type 1′ and type 1′′, which
are presumably catalytically active. A type 1′ site is an iso-
lated (i.e., mononuclear) Cr3+ ion that does not interact
with other chromium sites; it is sometimes referred to as dis-
persed Cr3+ (18). A type 1′′ site is a Cr3+ ion that has one or
more neighboring Cr3+ ions and thus is called multinuclear
Cr3+. Type 1′′ sites are also called “Cr3+ clusters.” In ad-
dition there are type 2 and type 3 sites, where the Cr3+
is not a surface ion but is buried inside chromia crystallites
(type 2) or the alumina support (type 3). Since types 2 and 3
are not surface species, they are not catalytically active.
Chromia crystallites consist of type 1′′ and type 2 sites to-
gether and may grow in size so that they become visible in
X-ray diffraction (XRD).
The Cr3+ species have also been classiﬁed in terms of
origin (7, 10–12). Those Cr3+ ions that have been formed
through reduction of chromium in high oxidation states
(Cr6+ and Cr5+) in a reducing atmosphere are referred to as
“redox Cr3+,” whereas those Cr3+ ions that have been sta-
bilized as Cr3+ are referred to as “nonredox Cr3+.” Redox
Cr3+ is exposed on the surface and thus can be catalytically
active. Nonredox Cr3+ may be exposed and catalytically ac-
tive, but it may also be buried inside chromia crystallites or
insidethealuminasupportandthusbecatalyticallyinactive.
Redox Cr3+ is abundant in chromia/alumina catalysts with
low chromium loading, whereas nonredox is Cr3+ mostly
present in catalysts with higher loadings (10).
Figure 1b shows how the classiﬁcations in terms of type
and origin overlap. Since Cr6+ and Cr5+ sites are often iso-
lated on the alumina surface, type 1′ sites and redox Cr3+

are largely the same. However, UV–visible near-infrared
diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy (UV–vis NIR DRS), elec-
tron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR), and Raman spec-
troscopy have shown that Cr6+ and Cr5+ ions present
on oxidized chromia/alumina catalysts may have neigh-
boring chromium ions (26, 27). Thus, some redox Cr3+
probably falls in the category of type 1′′ sites. Exposed
nonredox Cr3+ should be mostly classiﬁed as type 1′′ with
minor contributions from type 1′ sites, and nonexposed
nonredox Cr3+ should be classiﬁed as type 2 or type
3 sites.
Several questions need to be addressed in regard to the
chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts. Do the cat-
alytic activity and rate of deactivation of the various Cr3+
sites differ (7, 10, 12, 25)? Is Cr2+ present in chromia/
alumina dehydrogenation catalysts (13)? Does the phase
of the alumina support affect the catalytic activity of chro-
mia (19)? Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts have a high
chromium loading of about 15 atCr/nm2 (1). Can relevant in-
formation on the active sites be gained by studying catalysts
with low chromium loadings (6, 12, 13)? When used under
cycling of severe oxidizing and reducing conditions over a
period of years in industrial operations, chromia/alumina
catalysts deactivate through the formation of solid solu-
tions of chromia–alumina (1, 3). How does the irreversible
deactivation occur?
The main interest in the present work is the physico-
chemical processes leading to irreversible deactivation of
chromia/alumina catalysts. For this purpose, chromia was
supported on alumina containing various amounts of γ-, θ-,
or α-alumina. The catalysts were calcined at different tem-
peratures (600, 900, 1000, 1100, and 1200◦C) in order to
generate catalytically inactive Cr3+ species (21). On the
basis of studies by nitrogen physisorption, XRD, UV–vis
DRS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ESR,
we propose a model describing the deactivation process
in terms of catalyst-support sintering and chromium mi-
gration. In addition, we discuss the effect of the alumina
support on the deactivation and the catalytic activity of the
various Cr3+ species.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalyst Preparation
Chromia/alumina samples with 4 wt% Cr were chosen to
evaluate the effect of alumina precalcination temperature
and catalyst calcination temperature on dehydrogenation
activity. At this loading, high dehydrogenation selectivities
should be obtained (10), and at the same time spectroscopic
characterization of the samples should be feasible. The sam-
ples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of
CrO3 (UCB chemicals, p.a.) from an aqueous solution onto
a commercial alumina support (AKZO 001-1.5E) that had
been pulverized with a ball mill. Alumina was precalcined
in ambient air at 800, 1000, and 1200◦C for 24 h to pro-
duce supports with different surface areas and crystalline
phases. After impregnation, the samples were aged for 4 h
and dried for 4 h at 60 and 120◦C, respectively. The whole
catalyst batch was then calcined at 600◦C for 24 h; after
this, part of it was removed, calcination was continued at
900◦C for 24 h, part was removed, and so on, until the ﬁnal
part of the catalyst batch had been calcined at 1200◦C for
24 h.
The samples are described in Table 1. In the following
they are referred to with one- or two-numbered sample
codes: the ﬁrst number of the sample code indicates the
alumina precalcination temperature and the second num-
ber the catalyst calcination temperature. Thus, sample 8 is a
reference sample of alumina calcined at 800◦C, while chro-
mia/alumina catalyst 8-6 was prepared on alumina precal-
cined at 800◦C and, thereafter, calcined at 600◦C. Notations
such as “8-∗series” refer to samples 8-6, 8-9, 8-10, 8-11, and
8-12.
Nitrogen Physisorption
Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured for the
samples with Coulter Omnisorp 100 equipment. Samples
were pretreated in vacuum at 400◦C overnight. The sur-
face areas were determined from the adsorption curve in
the p/p0 range 0.05–0.2 by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method. Pore volumes were determined from the
desorption curve by the Barrett–Joyner–Hallender (BJH)
method.
X-Ray Diffraction
The presence of different alumina and chromia phases
was investigated by XRD. Diffractograms were measured
by a Siemens D5000 matic X-Ray-Diffractometer, and the
phases were identiﬁed with the database of Siemens Diffrac
AT program ( c
⃝1993).

Propane Dehydrogenation Activity
The dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst samples was
measured in a tubular ﬁxed-bed reactor equipped with an
in situ DRS facility (21). A fresh 0.2-g batch of catalyst,
ground and pelletized to a particle size of 0.25–0.5 mm, was
used for each run. Propane (Alpha Gas, 99.95 vol%) diluted
to 10% with helium (Air Liquide, 99.995 vol%) was used as
the feed. The catalyst was regenerated with 5% oxygen (Air
Liquide, 99.5 vol%) in helium. Helium ﬂushes separated de-
hydrogenation and regeneration. A ﬂow rate of 25 cm3/min
wasused.Threedehydrogenationcycleswerecarriedout.A
cycle consisted of a 20-min dehydrogenation, 30-min ﬂush
with helium, 40-min regeneration, and 20-min ﬂush with
helium. The outlet gases were analyzed online by a gas
chromatograph (HP 5830A) equipped with a ﬂame ion-
ization detector and a packed column (n-octane/porasil c).
Components eluted in the order methane, combination of
ethane and ethene, propane, and propene. Samples were
taken at 4 and 17 min from the start of the propane feed.
Conversion (X), yield (Y), and selectivity (S) were calcu-
lated on a molar basis as follows: X = 100% · (Fpropane,in −
Fpropane,out)/Fpropane,in (Fi is the molar ﬂow of component i),
Yi = 100% · Fi,out/Fpropene,in, and Si = 100% · Yi/X. The
molar response factor of propene relative to propane was
determined to be 1.08; the response factors published by
Dietz (28) were used for other components. The results are
presented for the second dehydrogenation cycle if not oth-
erwise stated.
Ex Situ Diffuse Reﬂectance Spectroscopy
The coordination environment of Cr3+ in the chromia/
alumina samples was investigated by UV–vis NIR DRS
measurements carried out at room temperature under
nitrogen atmosphere. To distinguish it from the in situ DRS
measurements (see below), the UV–vis NIR DRS tech-
nique will be referred to as ex situ DRS. Spectra were col-
lected with a Cary 5 UV–vis NIR spectrophotometer in
the wavenumber range 50,000–4,000 cm−1, from samples
placed in a quartz cell equipped with a suprasil window.
Spectra were measured for hydrated samples (that is, sam-
ples that were kept in ambient air), for samples oxidized
in air at 550◦C overnight, and for samples reduced there-
after in hydrogen at 550◦C for about 4 h. The reduction
step was needed to observe the positions of the d–d transi-
tions of Cr3+ without the interfering effect of Cr6+ charge
transfer bands. A commercial white reference, Labsphere
SBS-99-010, was used. Spectra are shown in the Kubelka–
Munk format (K–M = (1 −R)2/2R; R = reﬂectance).
In Situ Diffuse Reﬂectance Spectroscopy
The oxidation state and coordination environment of
chromium were investigated in situ during the dehydro-
genation runs at 580◦C by a ﬁberoptic in situ DRS setup
that has been described previously (21). In the in situ DRS
setup, light is directed to and collected from the catalyst bed
by a ﬁberoptic probe that withstands high temperatures and
IRREVERSIBLE DEACTIVATION OF CrOx/Al2O3 CATALYSTS

whose tip is in close contact with the catalyst bed. Spec-
tra were collected in the UV–vis region in the wavenum-
ber range 35,000–11,530 cm−1. One scan was typically mea-
sured in 70 ms. About 10 or 1000 scans were averaged for
one spectrum, depending on the desired rate of collecting
spectra and on the signal-to-noise ratio. AKZO 001-1.5E
alumina calcined at 800◦C and crushed and sieved to a par-
ticle size of 0.25–0.50 mm was used as the white reference
material.
Higher measurement temperature affects the DR spec-
trum: the Cr3+ d–d bands shift to lower energy and be-
come wider and more intense (the band areas increase)
(29, p. 360). Previous measurements (21, 30) with the same
in situ setup showed that increase from room tempera-
ture to 580◦C shifts the d–d transitions of Cr3+ at about
17,000 and 22,000 cm−1 to lower energy by about 700 and
200 cm−1.
X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The relative amount of chromium present in the fresh
catalysts was investigated by XPS for samples that had been
stored under ambient air. Spectra were measured with a
Vacuum Generators XPS system, using a CLAM-2 hemi-
spherical analyzer for electron detection. Nonmonochro-
matic Al Kα X-rays, together with an anode current of
20 mA at 10 keV, were used to excite the photoelectron
spectra. The pass energy of the analyzer was set at 50 eV
and data were collected at intervals of 0.1 eV. Survey spec-
tra were taken with a pass energy of 100 eV at intervals of
0.5 eV. Binding energies are reported with the Al 2p band
at 74.7 eV as reference.
The coverage of alumina by chromia was calculated by an
XPSanalysisprogram(DebyeInstitute,UtrechtUniversity,
The Netherlands) for the 8-6, 10-6, and 12-6 samples. The
Cr/Al band intensity ratios, surface areas of the catalysts,
and chromium contents were used as input parameters. The
calculation assumes that uniform chromia clusters cover the
alumina support (31).
Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy
The presence of Cr3+ and Cr5+ in the samples was in-
vestigated by ESR. The samples were placed in a quartz
cell equipped with a side arm for the ESR measurements.
X-band spectra were recorded at room temperature and
−153◦C with Bruker ESP 300 E equipment. A spectrum
of the empty cavity was subtracted from the sample spec-
tra. Samples were investigated under dry nitrogen (i) after
oxidation overnight at 550◦C with O2 and (ii) after subse-
quent reduction overnight at 550◦C with H2. For reference,
an ESR spectrum was measured for a commercial chro-
mia/alumina catalyst sample (20 wt% Cr) that had been
accidentally overheated in excess of 1200◦C.
Isoelectric Point Measurements
To assess the acidity of the alumina as a function of the
heat treatment, isoelectric point (IEP) was measured for
the different alumina supports. Suspensions of 1% alumina
support were placed in an ultrasonic bath for 2 h. After,
ultrasonication clear solutions were obtained, which were
electrophoretically analyzed using a Malvern Instruments
Zetamaster S instrument.
RESULTS
Physicochemical Characteristics of the Catalysts
The chromia/alumina samples (4 wt% Cr), whose alu-
mina precalcination temperatures and catalyst calcination
temperature were varied, are deﬁned in Table 1. The sam-
ples that had been calcined at 600◦C were brown, and they
turned green and light green when the temperature was in-
creased to 1200◦C. Increasing the alumina precalcination
temperature caused the color to be more gray; the 12-12
sample was light gray with a shade of ruby red.
The results for the nitrogen physisorption measurements
are reported in Table 1. As expected, the surface area of alu-
mina decreased when the precalcination temperature was
increased from 800 to 1200◦C. During impregnation, the
surface area stayed more or less constant. For the 8-∗and
10-∗series, the decrease in surface area during calcination
at temperatures 800, 1000, and 1200◦C was less than the de-
crease for alumina. For the 12-∗series, there was a steady
decrease in surface area as the calcination temperature was
raised, and the lowest surface area of all was for the 12-12
sample. The pore volume of alumina decreased consistently
with increasing precalcination temperature. The pore vol-
ume of the chromia/alumina samples remained more or
less constant up to a calcination temperature of 1000◦C,
after which it dropped sharply. When the calcination tem-
perature reached 1200◦C, the pores of alumina collapsed
to a pore volume level below that of chromia/alumina
samples prepared on alumina precalcined at 800 and
1000◦C.
The X-ray diffractograms measured for the alumina sup-
ports are shown in Fig. 2A, and the phases present in the
samples are summarized in Table 1. The observed phase
change from γ-alumina through θ-alumina to α-alumina
is in accord with the literature (32). Note that δ-alumina
may have formed from γ-alumina before the detection
of θ-alumina, without having been detected; the peaks of
γ-aluminaandδ-aluminaaretooclosetobeseparatedwhen
the peaks are broadened by the small crystallite size.
The X-ray diffractograms of chromia/alumina samples
are shown in Figs. 2B–2D. Alumina phases were identiﬁed
in all X-ray diffractograms. In the 8-∗series, only γ-alumina
was seen after calcination at 600◦C. Small amounts of
θ-alumina were initially seen at 900◦C, and a small amount

alumina calcined at 1200◦C. For the chromia/alumina sam-
ples calcined at 1200◦C, the lower the precalcination tem-
perature, the smaller the amount of α-alumina. No peaks
of crystalline chromia or of chromia–alumina solid solution
were seen in the X-ray diffractograms, except for very weak
peaks for samples 12-6, 12-9, and 12-10.
Both the nitrogen physisorption and XRD measure-
ments showed the sintering of alumina to be more
pronounced for the alumina support alone than for the
chromia/alumina samples. Sintering was seen as a phase
transformation from γ-alumina through θ-alumina to
α-alumina and as the loss of surface area. In particular,
the 8-∗series was resistant to sintering. Our result is in ac-
cord with the observations of Simon et al. (33), who found
that the presence of chromia inhibits the transformation of
γ-alumina to α-alumina at temperatures up to 860◦C. How-
ever, it is contradictory to the conclusion of Vuurman et al.
(17) and El-Shobaky et al. (34) that the presence of chromia
on alumina enhances sintering. The reason for the different
ﬁndings remains unclear.
The chromium contents calculated per unit surface area
of the samples, denoted as surface loading, are reported
in Table 1. The values lie between 2.5 and 16.0 atCr/nm2
(chromium ions per square nanometer of sample). Some
are thus below and some above the surface density of
chromium on crystalline CrO3 and on Cr2O3, about 4.7 and
10.8 atCr/nm2, respectively (24, 35).

all the catalysts. However, there were differences in the de-
activation behavior of the catalysts prepared on different
aluminas. After 4 min on stream (Fig. 3A) the activity or-
der was 12-∗≈10-∗> 8-∗for calcination below 900◦C and
8-∗> 10-∗> 12-∗for calcination above 900◦C. This
shows that the 10-∗and 12-∗series were less resistant to
deactivation than the 8-∗series upon calcination above
900◦C.
The deactivation behavior of the catalyst during time of
propane on stream varied with the catalyst. As seen by com-
paring Figs. 3A and 3B, the 10-∗and 12-∗series deacti-
vated rapidly during time on stream, and after 17 min of
propane on stream the activity order was 8-∗≥10-∗> 12-∗
for all calcination temperatures. Deactivation during time
on stream was least notable for the 8-∗series, but with in-

WenotethattheprobeoftheinsituDRspectrometerwas
present in the reactor during the catalysis runs. The outer
surface of the probe is made of stainless steel. To determine
whether the high-temperature probe had catalytic activity,
the activity of 8 alumina was measured in the presence and
absence of the probe. With the probe, propane conversion
and propene yield were 8.1 and 0.5%, respectively, whereas
without the probe they were 4.5 and 0.6%. Thus, the probe
converted propane, but it did not have dehydrogenation
activity.
Ex Situ Diffuse Reﬂectance Spectroscopy
Ex situ DR spectra were measured for the chro-
mia/alumina samples to investigate to what extent incor-
poration of Cr3+ in alumina had taken place during the cal-
cination of the catalysts. Incorporation should be seen as a
shift in the positions of the two d–d bands of Cr3+ : Cr3+
in chromia-type species (not incorporated in alumina),
and Cr3+ incorporated into alumina absorb at different
wavenumbers, as presented in Table 2.
Spectra of sample 8-12 are shown as an example in Fig. 4.
The spectra of other samples showed similar bands. The
spectra of sample 8-12 in its hydrated and calcined form
showed an intense Cr6+ charge transition (18, 36) at about
26,000 cm−1. There was also a shoulder caused by the ﬁrst
d–d transition of Cr3+ (18; see also 29, p. 111) at about

16,700 cm−1. In the spectrum of the reduced 8-12 sample,
the Cr6+ band was not present, and the two d–d transi-
tions of Cr3+ were well resolved. A third band could be
seen in all samples at about 10,000 cm−1. This may indicate
the presence of Cr3+ in distorted coordination, for exam-
ple low-coordinated Cr3+ species, or the presence of Cr2+
(18, 38). The maxima of the three bands in the sample spec-
tra are reported in Table 3. A shift in the Cr3+ d–d bands
to higher frequencies was observed with increasing catalyst
calcination temperature.
We now estimate the fraction of Cr3+ incorporated in
alumina (type 3 sites) of the total Cr3+ content from the
positions of the d–d transitions of Cr3+ in the ex situ DR
spectra. For the estimation we assume that (i) the extinction

coefﬁcients and the bandwidths are the same for alumina-
incorporated Cr3+ (type 3) and Cr3+ not incorporated into
alumina (types 1 and 2 together), and (ii) the d–d tran-
sition bands can be approximated by Gaussian functions.
Both assumptions should be physically acceptable. From
our spectra and from the literature (18) we estimated val-
ues for the widths of the ﬁrst and second d–d transition to
be about 4000 and 6000 cm−1, respectively.
The expected maxima of the summed Cr3+ d–d bands
for a certain fraction of alumina-incorporated Cr3+ are dis-
played in Fig. 5A. By comparing the observed maxima
against the expected positions, we can estimate the frac-
tion of alumina-incorporated Cr3+. The results are shown
in Fig. 5B. The extent of incorporation of Cr3+ in alumina

of the reaction). (B) Spectra collected in 1 s (20 scans of 50 ms) during

increased with the catalyst calcination temperature and alu-
mina precalcination temperature. For the 8-∗and 10-∗se-
ries, strong background absorption shifted the positions of
the second d–d transitions to higher energy, so that they
could not be used for the estimation. For the 12-∗series,
background absorption was low, and the second d–d tran-
sitions could be used for the estimation. As can be seen
in Fig. 6B, the fractions of alumina-incorporated Cr3+ es-
timated for the 12-∗series from the ﬁrst and second d–d
transitions agreed within ±0.05, indicating the reliability of
the estimation procedure.
From the total chromium loading (4 wt% Cr), the es-
timated fraction of alumina-incorporated Cr3+ (Fig. 5B),
and the surface area of the samples, we could calculate the
surface loading of chromium that was not incorporated into
alumina and was available for catalysis. These values are re-
ported in Table 1. The surface loading of nonincorporated
Cr3+ stayed more or less constant for the 8-∗series, de-
creased slightly after calcination above 1000◦C for the 10-∗
series, and decreased steadily with increasing calcination
temperature for the 12-∗series.
In Situ Diffuse Reﬂectance Spectroscopy
The catalysts of the 8-∗and 12-∗series were monitored
in situ by DRS during the dehydrogenation runs to see
which oxidation states of chromium were present during
catalysis. The behavior of the 8-6, 8-9, 8-10, and 8-11 sam-
ples was similar. Figure 6A shows spectra measured for the
8-11 sample as an example. Cr6+ was present after the heat-
ing of the sample to the reaction temperature (580◦C), as
shown by the Cr6+ charge transfer band centered at about
25,600 cm−1 (see curve a). Cr3+ was also present, seen as
a shoulder around 17,000 cm−1. (Note that increased mea-
surement temperature shifts the band maxima to a lower
wavenumber.) During the following helium ﬂush, the in-
tensity of the Cr6+ band decreased slightly, indicating that
not all the Cr6+ was stable (curve b).
When propane was introduced, Cr6+ was reduced and the
Cr6+ banddisappeared(Fig.6A,curvec).Spectrameasured
during reduction are shown in Fig. 6B, and the intensity at
26,000 cm−1 as a function of time is reported in Fig. 7A.
The Cr6+ was reduced in about 10 s and the two d–d transi-
tions of Cr3+ became resolved at 16,500 and 23,500 cm−1, as
shown in curve c of Fig. 6A. The d–d band maxima of Cr3+
shifted to higher energy with increasing catalyst calcina-
tion temperature and alumina precalcination temperature,
in accord with the results of ex situ DRS. After reduction,
coke formation began, as seen in the increased background
absorption (see Fig. 7B and curve d in Fig. 6A). No indica-
tion of Cr2+ around 10,000 cm−1 was seen in the spectra, but
the spectrum did not extend to sufﬁciently low wavenum-
bers to allow us to exclude its presence.
Coke was removed during the oxidative regeneration in
about 3 min (see Fig. 7C), as seen from a decrease in the
background absorption. A spectrum typical of Cr6+ with
a band at 25,700 cm−1 was formed, with a shoulder due
to Cr3+. The Cr6+ band continued to intensify during the
whole oxidative regeneration (see Fig. 7D) without obtain-
ing the original intensity. The spectroscopic features of the
second and third dehydrogenation cycles resembled those
of the ﬁrst cycle, with the exception that the Cr6+ was re-
duced to Cr3+ during the helium ﬂush preceding dehydro-
genation.
The spectra of the 8-12 sample differed from those of
other samples of the 8–∗series but they resembled the

spectra measured for the 12-∗series. The band of Cr6+ was
not present in any of these spectra. Well-resolved d–d tran-
sitions of Cr3+ were present, and coke formation appeared
as increased background intensity during dehydrogenation.
X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
XPS measurements were carried out to investigate the
surface concentration of chromium in the fresh catalysts.
The Cr/Al band intensity ratios are given in Table 3. For
samples calcined at 600◦C, the ratio increased with the alu-
mina precalcination temperature, as expected for increas-
ing surface loading of chromium (see Table 1). The cover-
age of alumina by chromia was calculated as 70, 77, and
97% for the 8-6, 10-6, and 12-6 samples, respectively, and
the corresponding thickness of the chromia layer was cal-
culated as 1.2, 2.8, and 5.1 ˚
A. The chromia layer was thus
well dispersed over alumina.
The Cr/Al band intensity ratio decreased with increasing
calcination temperature, indicating that chromium was lost
from the surface. This was minor for the 8-∗series (decrease
by 21% during calcination to 1200◦C), more notable for the
10-∗series (45%), and most pronounced for the 12-∗se-
ries (64%). Two processes (or their combined effect) could
account for the decrease in the Cr/Al band intensity ratio:
(i) an increase in the size of chromia crystallites (sintering
of chromia) or (ii) incorporation of Cr3+ into the alumina
support through migration, that is, mixing of phases. Incor-
poration through entrapment during sintering of the alu-
mina support should not decrease the Cr/Al band intensity
ratio.
Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy
ESR measurements were carried out to investigate the
effect of calcination treatments on the chromium species.
Typically, three ESR resonances are reported for chro-
mia/alumina: the γ-, β-, and δ-signal (5, 6, 22, 39). The

γ-signal is centered at about g = 1.97, has a width of
about 50–60 G, and originates from isolated Cr5+ species
that are stabilized on the surface of alumina in square–
pyramidal symmetry (5, 6, 22). The β-signal originates from
Cr2O3 clusters of small dimensions; widths between 800 and
1800 G and g = 1.95–1.98 have been reported (5, 6, 22). The
β-signal becomes narrower and shifts to a lower g factor
with increasing cluster size (40), with the values ﬁnally ap-
proaching those of α-chromia (g = 1.98, width about 500 G
(5)). α-Chromia, however, has a N´
eel temperature of 34◦C
and cannot be seen in spectra measured at or below room
temperature (6). The δ-signal originates from isolated Cr3+
in distorted octahedral coordination. It is a broad signal,
with contributions at about g = 2.2 (5) and 2.5–4.3 (22).
There is no general agreement in the literature on the ex-
act origin of the δ-signal: catalytically active surface Cr3+
species (25) and catalytically inactive alumina-incorporated
Cr3+ species (6) have both been concluded. We will attempt
to clarify this inconsistency.
ESR spectra were measured for samples in their oxidized
and reduced forms at room temperature and at −153◦C.
Spectra for the samples calcined at 1200◦C are shown in
Fig. 8. The presence or absence of the γ-, β-, and δ-signals
in the sample spectra is summarized in Table 3. The γ-signal,
which originates from Cr5+, was observed in almost all the
spectra of oxidized samples, with a position of typically
g = 1.97 and a width of 70–90 G. The signal seemed to be
less intense the higher the alumina precalcination tempera-
ture,andintheextremecaseofthe12-12sample,noγ-signal
could be seen. Thus, the amount of Cr5+ seemed to decrease
with increasing precalcination temperature. In the spectra
of reduced samples, the γ-signal signal was typically either
absent or considerably decreased in intensity. Hydrogen
treatment at 550◦C thus reduced Cr5+ to lower oxidation
states, as indicated also by the ex situ DRS measurements.
However, for some samples, especially 8-6, the signal in-
creased during the reduction step, indicating stabilization

of Cr5+ species. Our results are in accord with literature
reports that some Cr5+ ions are stable in hydrogen but are
reduced by alkanes (25, 41).
In the spectra of the 8-6, 10-6, and 12-6 samples, the
β-signal became narrower with increasing alumina precal-
cination temperature. This is in line with the increase in
the surface loading of chromium with increasing alumina
precalcination temperature (see Table 1); higher surface
loading should result in larger size of the chromia clusters
and thus a narrower β-signal. In the other sample spectra,
the β-signal was generally very wide or absent (see Table 2).
There was no indication that the β-signal became narrower
with increasing catalyst calcination temperature. Thus, the
decrease in dispersion with increasing calcination temper-
ature suggested by XPS was not conﬁrmed by ESR.
The δ-signal was observed for all samples except 12-12
(see Table 3). Comparison of the different ESR spectra
(examples are shown in Fig. 9A) showed that the δ-signal
is highly complex. It consisted of two main maxima: one
located at g ≈4.0–5.5 and the other at g ≈2.6. In addition,
there may have been a small hump at g ≈3.5. The observed
signal position is generally in accord with the literature val-
ues (5, 22, 33). Moreover, simulations of the δ-signal have
suggested that a maximum should appear at g ≈2 (40).
Even though the position of the δ-signal was constant in
the sample spectra, its appearance was not. For samples
calcined at low temperature, the signal was wide and the
contribution at g ≈2.6 was indistinct, whereas for samples
calcined at high temperatures, the maxima were sharp and
the contribution at g ≈2.6 was clearly seen.
There is disagreement in the literature on the origin of the
δ-signal: it originates either (i) from alumina-incorporated
Cr3+ or (ii) from isolated, catalytically active Cr3+ surface
species. Our current and earlier (18) in situ and ex situ
DRS measurements have conﬁrmed that the extent of in-
corporation of Cr3+ into alumina increases with catalyst
calcination temperature and alumina precalcination tem-
perature. Thus, if the δ-signal originated from alumina-
incorporated Cr3+, we would expect its intensity to have
increased with the catalyst calcination temperature. The
intensity was analyzed for the 10-∗series, but no trend
was observed. Furthermore, the intensity decreased with
increasing alumina precalcination temperature. We found
no evidence, therefore, that the δ-signal originated from
alumina-incorporated Cr3+.
Several pieces of evidence suggest that the δ-signal orig-
inates from surface Cr3+ species. (i) In accordance with
earlier observations (5, 25, 42), the intensity of the sig-
nal increased during reduction of the samples (see Figs. 8
and 10A). This suggests that part of the Cr3+ responsible
for the δ-signal formed through the reduction of chromium
in higher oxidation states (Cr6+ and Cr5+). Relevant to this,
Simon et al. (33) observed the reverse process: during oxida-
tion, Cr5+ (γ-signal) was formed from the Cr3+ responsible
for the δ-signal. Reduction–oxidation treatments are ex-
pected predominantly to affect surface species. (ii) Further
evidence for the surface Cr3+ species is that the appearance
of the signal varied with the sample type (see the compar-
ison in Fig. 9B). The coordination environment of surface
Cr3+ speciesmaychangewhenthesampletypechanges,and
this could affect δ-signal. (iii) The intensity of the δ-signal
also decreased with increasing precalcination temperature
of alumina. The number of sites where Cr3+ can be stabi-
lized in isolated positions presumably is more or less con-
stant per unit surface area, so that in the 8-12, 10-12, and
12-12 samples the ratio of sites for isolated Cr3+ is about
2.5 : 2.0 : 1.0. The marked increase in chromium loading per
square nanometer with the alumina precalcination temper-
ature (see Table 1) could be expected to further decrease
theamountofisolatedCr3+ sites.Wewouldthusexpectcon-
siderably higher concentrations of isolated Cr3+ species on
aluminas precalcined at lower temperatures. This type of
behavior was seen for the δ-signal. We conclude, in accord
with Br¨
uckner et al. (25), that the δ-signal originates from
isolated Cr3+ surface sites. The δ-signal intensities indicate
that the order of abundance of isolated Cr3+ sites in the
samples calcined at 600◦C was 8-6 ≫10-6 > 12-6.
In addition to the γ-, β-, and δ-signals, our spectra pre-
sented a fourth signal, which, to our knowledge, has not
beenreportedbefore.Thissignalhadasymmetriclineshape
with a center at g = 2.00–2.01 and a width of ∼350–500 G.
It is denoted “κ” in Table 3. The κ-signal was most in-
tense and most clearly resolved—because of the absence
of other signals—in the spectra measured for the 12-12
sample, shown in Fig. 8. The signal intensity appeared
to decrease slightly with a decrease in the measurement
428
PUURUNEN AND WECKHUYSEN
temperature, but the linewidth remained constant. The un-
changing linewidth distinguishes the κ-signal from the β-
signal. Reduction with hydrogen did not affect the inten-
sity of the signal. Since this signal was observed in the
reduced samples, we conclude that it probably originated
from some Cr3+ species. The symmetric lineshape indicates
well-deﬁned octahedral environment and the position and
linewidth resemble those reported for α-Cr2O3. However,
since α-Cr2O3 should not be seen at temperatures below
room temperature (5), the signal cannot originate from
α-Cr2O3. A reference ruby-type chromia/alumina sam-
ple had a similar ESR spectrum, suggesting that a mixed
chromia–alumina phase or isolated Cr3+ located inside alu-
mina could be responsible for the κ-signal. In future, simu-
lations and multifrequency ESR measurements would help
to clarify the origin of the κ-signal.
DISCUSSION
Deactivation during Calcination at High Temperatures
Calcination of the chromia/alumina catalysts at high tem-
peratures (up to 1200◦C) led to their deactivation (see
Fig. 3). The catalysts prepared on alumina precalcined
at 800◦C deactivated the least. Three factors could have
caused the deactivation with increasing calcination tem-
perature: (i) the turnover frequency per exposed chromium
ion could have decreased, (ii) the chromia crystallites could
have sintered, generating inactive Cr3+ sites of type 2, or
(iii) chromium could have incorporated inside alumina,
generating inactive Cr3+ sites of type 3 (see Fig. 1a, for
types of Cr3+ sites).
We do not consider it likely that the turnover frequency
of the chromium sites decreased drastically enough to ex-
plain the drop in activity with increasing catalyst calcination
temperature. It has been found that the dehydrogenation
activity of chromia/alumina catalysts increases more or less
linearly with chromium loading up to a surface loading of
10–12 atCr/nm2; beyond this it decreases (7, 10). The ﬁnd-
ing indicates that the catalytic activity of the different sites
(types 1′ and 1′′ or redox Cr3+ and nonredox Cr3+) should
be of the same order of magnitude. It also seems improb-
able that sintering of chromia with increasing catalyst cal-
cination temperature could explain the drastic decrease in
activity, since the spectroscopic characterization by ESR
and XRD did not reveal much increase in the cluster size
of chromia. (XPS indicated that surface chromium species
were lost during calcination of the catalysts, but it could
not differentiate between the two processes of sintering of
chromia and incorporation of chromium into alumina.)
To investigate whether incorporation of Cr3+ inside the
alumina support could explain the observed deactivation
with increasing catalyst calcination temperature, the per-
centage decrease in propene yield and percentage increase
in the fraction of alumina-incorporated Cr3+ (estimated

from ex situ DRS) as a function of the catalyst calcina-
tion temperature are plotted in Fig. 10. The decrease in
yield and the increase in the fraction of incorporated Cr3+
roughly coincide for all series (8-∗, 10-∗, and 12-∗). The
agreement suggests that incorporation of Cr3+ inside the
alumina support was the main reason for the deactivation
with increasing catalyst calcination temperature.
The incorporation of Cr3+ inside alumina could have oc-
curred through two processes. (i) Chromium could have
been entrapped inside alumina when the structure of alu-
mina sintered during calcination at high temperatures.
(ii) Chromium could have migrated into the alumina during
calcination. These processes are schematically illustrated
in Fig. 11. The percentage decrease in surface area is plot-
ted as a function of the catalyst calcination temperature
in Fig. 10 for the three series. From Fig. 10A we see that,
for the 8-∗series, the extent of sintering of the sample
(that is, loss of surface area) and the amount of alumina-
incorporated Cr3+ roughly agree. This indicates that Cr3+
was incorporated into alumina mostly through the entrap-
ment process. The XPS results are in line with this conclu-
sion: a minor decrease was observed for the Cr/Al band
intensity ratio with increasing catalyst calcination temper-
ature. For the 10-∗series, the extent of sintering and the

amount of alumina-incorporated Cr3+ agreed up to a calci-
nation temperature of 1000◦C. Beyond 1000◦C, the amount
of incorporated Cr3+ was greater than the extent of sinter-
ing. Thus, up to about 1000◦C, catalytically active Cr3+ was
lostmostlythroughentrapment,andathighertemperatures
also through migration. For the 12-∗series, the amount of
alumina-incorporated Cr3+ seems greater than the extent
of sintering, and migration seems to account for the loss of
active Cr3+.
We conclude that incorporation of Cr3+ into the alu-
mina support took place through two processes: entrap-
ment caused by sintering of the support, and migration of
Cr3+ into the support. Which of these processes occurred
depended on the structure of the alumina support: on sam-
ples rich in γ-alumina only entrapment occurred, whereas
on samples with practically no γ-alumina migration domi-
nated.
Effect of Support on Dehydrogenation Activity
The type of support affected the activity of the chro-
mia/alumina catalysts: for catalyst calcination at 600◦C,
samples prepared on 10 and 12 alumina were initially (4 min
of propane on stream) signiﬁcantly more active than the
sample prepared on 8 alumina. For a meaningful com-
parison of these results, with each other and with litera-
ture data, we calculated turnover frequencies (TOF). The
estimated surface loading of the samples remained be-
low 10.84 atCr/nm2 (see Table 1), which is the density of
chromium on the surface of α-Cr2O3 (35), indicating that
all the chromium not incorporated in alumina should have
been available for catalysis. The TOFs were calculated per
chromium ion type not incorporated in alumina. Thus, the
TOFs represent the average values for the different species
present on the surface (type 1′, type 1′′, and maybe even
some type 2 sites).
The TOF values, reported in Table 3, are of the same or-
der of magnitude as those reported by De Rossi et al. (5, 6)
for chromia/alumina catalysts. For the catalysts calcined at
600◦C, the order of the TOFs was 12-6 > 10-6 > 8-6. With in-
creasing catalyst calcination temperature, TOFs remained
approximately constant for the 8-∗series and decreased for
the 10-∗and 12-∗series. Furthermore, for catalyst calcina-
tion at 1200◦C, the TOFs were identical for the 8-∗, 10-∗,
and 12-∗series. The trend in TOF with increasing cata-
lyst calcination temperature would seem to exclude a rela-
tionship between the presence of θ-alumina and α-alumina
and the activity of the Cr3+ sites (which we proposed ear-
lier (21)): had there been a relationship, the TOF values
should have increased with the catalyst calcination tem-
perature, but the opposite was observed. The differences
in the TOF values seem instead to be due to the differ-
ent activities of the surface Cr3+ species. ESR investigation
showed that the 8-6 catalyst sample (alumina-supported
chromium, 2.5 atCr/nm2) contained the greatest number of
isolated Cr3+ sites, the 10-6 sample (3.9 atCr/nm2) consider-
ably fewer, and the 12-6 sample (6.9 atCr/nm2) almost none.
Thus, the TOF values increased with a decreasing number
of isolated Cr3+ (type 1′) sites, that is, with an increasing
number of multinuclear (type 1′′) Cr3+ sites.
Our ﬁnding that type 1′′ sites are more active in dehy-
drogenation than type 1′ sites is in full agreement with the
results of Br¨
uckner et al. (25), according to whom multin-
uclear Cr3+ sites (type 1′′ sites) are catalytically more ac-
tive than isolated Cr3+ sites (type 1′). It is also in accord
with the proposal of Cavani et al. (7) and Airaksinen et al.
(12) that nonredox Cr3+ is more active than redox Cr3+ in
dehydrogenation. Our ﬁnding differs from the conclusion
of De Rossi et al. (5, 6) that mononuclear redox Cr3+ is
the active dehydrogenation site, and from the conclusion
of Hakuli et al. (10) that the size of chromia ensembles
has no effect. De Rossi et al. (6) noted, however, that for
higher chromium loadings, clustered (that is, nonredox or
type 1′′) chromia could have some catalytic activity. Hakuli
et al. (8, 10) suggested that redox Cr3+ could fully account
for the dehydrogenation activity up to a surface loading
of about 5 atCr nm−2, and beyond that nonredox Cr3+ must
also have dehydrogenation activity. At low chromium load-
ings (<5 atCr nm−2) nonredox Cr3+ would not be catalyti-
cally active because it is incorporated inside alumina (10).
On the basis of our present results, incorporation of Cr3+
into γ-alumina during calcination (at ∼600◦C) seems un-
likely, however.
The chromia/alumina catalysts deactivated reversibly
during time of propane on stream (compare Figs. 3A and
3B). For catalyst calcination at 600◦C, deactivation was
most severe in the order 12-6 > 10-6 > 8-6. Likely reasons
for the reversible deactivation could be that (i) active chro-
mia sintered under the presence of propane, resulting in a
decreased amount of catalytically active surface chromium,
(ii) highly active sites were rapidly blocked by coke for-
mation (43), or (iii) coke formation was dependent on the
type of alumina support. According to XPS C/Al band in-
tensity ratios measured for the catalysts, coke formation
was strongest for the catalysts in the order 12-6 > 10-6 ≈
8-6 (C/Al band intensity ratios were 3.1, 1.6, and 1.2, re-
spectively). The acidities of the supports were assessed by
measuring their IEPs. The IEPs of the 8, 10, and 12 alumina
samples were 9.0, 9.0, and 7.8, indicating that the 12 sup-
port was more acidic than the other supports. Thus, the
reversible deactivation could be explained by coke forma-
tion enhanced by the acidity of the alumina support. We
cannot exclude, however, the possibility that sintering of
chromia or selective coking of active Cr3+ species may have
occurred.
CONCLUSIONS
Catalyticallyinactive,alumina-incorporatedCr3+ species
(type 3) were formed in chromia/alumina catalysts through
two processes: (i) entrapment of Cr3+ ions inside the
430
PUURUNEN AND WECKHUYSEN
alumina support through sintering of the alumina sup-
port, and (ii) migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina
support. The amount of alumina-incorporated Cr3+ was
estimated by DRS measurements. The presence of impreg-
nated chromia inhibited the phase transformation from γ-
to α-alumina. The presence of γ-alumina, in turn, hindered
the migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina. Our results
indicate that the δ-signal in ESR spectra originates from
isolated surface Cr3+ species that are catalytically active
(type 1′ species). The dehydrogenation activity was higher
for multinuclear Cr3+ sites (type 1′′) than for isolated Cr3+
(type 1′). No substantial effect of the phase of the alumina
support on the dehydrogenation activity could be detected.
Presumably there are differences between the deactiva-
tion of chromia/alumina catalysts in this work and use of
chromia/alumina catalysts in industry. In this work, inactive
species were generated through an oxidative treatment of
the catalysts lasting a few days. In industrial use, catalysts
are expected to deactivate under both oxidizing and re-
ducing atmospheres at high temperatures during operation
of more than a year. The next step would be to investi-
gate the irreversible deactivation of chromia/alumina cata-
lysts with industriallike chromium loadings under reducing
conditions.
