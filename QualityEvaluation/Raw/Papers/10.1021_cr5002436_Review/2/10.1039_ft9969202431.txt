The X- and Q-band EPR spectra of Cr5+ 
and Cr3+ 
ions in heterogeneous Cr catalysts have been investigated as a function of the 
support type and composition (silica, silica-alumina, alumina, mordenite and AlPO-5). A spin-Hamiltonian operator for each of 
the observed types of resonances is proposed and discussed, while the extensive use of computer-simulated spectra provides 
detailed information on the nature of supported Cr ions. Mononuclear Cr5+ ions (y-signal), with g-values ca. 2, are axial on 
alumina and silica-alumina, and rhombic on silica and mordenite. Two different X-band EPR signals of Cr3+ 
ions are present on 
amorphous and crystalline oxidic surfaces: a broad signal with g around 2 and zero field parameters D 
and E equal to 0, due to 
clustered Cr3+ 
(#?-signal) 
or isolated octahedral Cr3+ complexes, and a signal with a positive lobe in the region g = 
3.5-5.5 (6- 
signal). The latter signal is characterized by high values of D 
and E and due to the presence of a highly distorted Cr3+octahedron. 
The data so obtained allow us to develop a general model of supported Cr5+ 
and Cr3+ 
ions on oxidic surfaces. 
Heterogeneous chromium catalysts are well known for their 
catalytic performances' and have been extensively studied in 
the past, especially the industrially used Phillips catalyst 
(Cr/SiO,).' Cr3+ (d3) and Cr5+ (d') are the EPR visible ions 
and therefore many characterization studies, based on elec- 
tron paramagnetic resonance, have appeared in the liter- 
ature.,-' ' 
The main literature results, mostly obtained from 
visual inspection of the experimental spectra, are summarized 
in Table 1. 
On amorphous supports, three different signals, denoted as 
y-, #?- and &signal, are observed. Thus the axially symmetric 
Cr5+ signal (y-signal), which has a sharp gL line and a weak 
somewhat diffuse gll line, is assigned to a square pyramidal 
species in y-alumina and a distorted tetrahedral species in 
silica, with both types of species proposed for Cr/zeolites. 
Recently, Cordischi et al." re-investigated the Cr5 
+ signals on 
amorphous supports using X-band EPR after interaction with 
water and ammonia by using 53Cr isotopes and simulation 
procedures. They showed that Cr5+ ions can be present on 
oxidic surfaces with (pseudo-) tetrahedral, square pyramidal 
and (pseudo-) octahedral coordination, depending on the 
treatment and on the support. Furthermore, they believed that 
the EPR spectra of Cr" 
on silica surfaces are slightly 
rhombic. 
Cr203 
cluster signals (#?-signal) 
are strongly dependent on 
size and shape of these clusters as evidenced by the broad 
range of g-values. They have been especially evident for 
Cr/A120, catalysts after reduction and recalcination.' 
Dis- 
persed Cr3+ (6-signal) is characterized by a broad signal 
around g = 
4.4-5.0. It has only a positive lobe and overlaps 
with Fe3+ signals, making its assignment difficult and some- 
times ambiguous. In general, its intensity increases with Cr 
loading and with reduction temperature and with these two 
parameters constant, with the alumina content of the 
support.' 
Both the description of the signals and their interpretation 
have been vague in the literature. A more detailed picture of 
the EPR active, supported Cr is presented here. This is carried 
out taking spectra at X- and Q-band, and by a systematic

simulation of the experimental spectra. The studied inorganic 
oxides are silica, alumina, silica-alumina, mordenite and 
AlPO-5, which allowed us to develop a more general model of 
supported Cr. 
Experimental 
Preparation and treatment of samples 
Cr/SiO,, Cr/Al,O, and Cr/SiO, - A1203 
(with 40 wt.% SiO,) 
catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness method with 
CrO, as impregnation salt using purpose-built supports. The 
preparation method and the characteristics of these supports 
are published el~ewhere'~-'~ 
and the Cr loading was 
0.2 wt.%.

The samples were dried at 
50°C for 8 h and then granulated. The size fraction 0.25-40 
mm was loaded in a quartz flow cell with a side arm for EPR. 
The samples were subsequently dried at 90°C for 16 h fol- 
lowed by calcination at 550°C for 6 h in an oxygen stream. 
The quartz cell was purged with nitrogen and EPR spectra 
were recorded on these calcined samples. The samples were 
then reduced with CO between 200 and 600°C in steps of 
100°C and EPR spectra were measured at each temperature. 
The O2 and CO flows were, for all the pretreatments, 3600 
and 1800 
ml h- ', respectively. 
Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 
EPR spectra of the samples were taken on a Bruker (Billeria, 
MA, USA) Model ESP300E instrument at the X-band 
between 120 and 370 K and a Varian (Palo Alto, CA, USA) 
El12 spectrometer at the Q-band and X-band at 300 K and 
150 K. EPR simulations were performed by simulation pro- 
grams developed by Mabbs and Collison and written in 
FORTRAN 4, processed with a FTN45 conversion package 
and using NAG library routines.20v21

mea- 
surements on Cr/SiO, and Cr/Al,O, catalysts were carried 
out using apparatus from Oxford Instruments (Oxford, UK). 
The applied magnetic field was equal or below 1 T and the 
magnetic susceptibility (x) was measured as a function of tem- 
perature (T) between 300 and 4.5 K. The samples were 
pretreated at 550°C in oxygen in an EPR-DRS flow cell, fol- 
lowed by a vacuum treatment at room temperature. The EPR 
tubes were filled with 1 cm powder and sealed off under 
vacuum. 
Results 
Crs+ signals 
CrS 
+ signals were observed after oxidative treatment and 
evacuation of molecular oxygen. Examples of the y-signal are 
shown in Fig. 1 for Cr/Al,O, and Cr/SiO, catalysts. The y- 
signals of the Cr/SiO,.Al,O, 
were similar to those of 
Cr/A1203 and will not be shown. In some cases, the spectrum 
of Cr/SiO, comprises two different signals as evidenced in Fig. 
2 by the weak gI1 
lines around 0.35 and 0.36 T. The g-values 
obtained by simulation with an axial/rhombic Hamiltonian 
are summarized in Table 2. The simulated spectra are also 
included in Fig. 1 and 2. For Cr5+ on alumina and silica- 
alumina, the g-values are axial with gI1 
= 1.910-1.939 and 
g1 = 1.975-1.979, respectively. On silica, however, there are 
two distinct sets of signals one axial and the other clearly 
rhombic with gxx 
= 1.978; g,,,, 
= 1.969 and gzz 
= 1.895. The 
latter signal is always dominant and its rhombic symmetry is 
in line with observations of Cordishi et al." 
The shoulder on 
the low field side of the spectrum in Fig. 1B is weak and due 
to some axially symmetric Cr5+. 
Its simulation, however, is 
not included in Fig. 1. The increase of the linewidth in going 
from silica to alumina is due to interaction of the unpaired 
electron of Cr5+ 
with "Al nuclei (I 
= 
5/2) and may eventually 
obscure the rhombic symmetry on alumina. An example of a 
Q-band EPR spectra for Cr/Al,O, is given in Fig. 3. This 
spectrum can be simulated by using the same parameters 
(except the linewidths) as for the X-band spectrum. The same 
holds for the Cr/Si02 and Cr/SiO, Al,O, catalysts.

The intensities of the y-signal follow the the Curie-Weiss 
law and the x - l  us. T plots, obtained by SQUID measure- 
ments show a true paramagnetic behaviour down,to 10 K. 
Between 10 and 4.5 K antiferromagnetic features were 
observed and consequently the x-' 
us. T plots deviate from 
linearity. Only for Cr/SiO, was the diamagnetic contribution 
high and this made it impossible to measure reasonable x-' 
us. T plots. In any case, our data show the presence of mag- 
netically isolated Cr5 
+ species. This rejects also the earlier 
proposal for the y-signal consisting of a trinuclear cluster 
(Cr3+-Cr6+-Cr3 +)22-23 because such clusters would not 
result in linear x- 
us. T plots. This conclusion is in line with 
earlier work of Cordishi et al."

The EPR spectrum of Cr5+ 
in mordenite molecular sieves, 
shown in Fig. 4, is very complex and can be described by two 
rhombic signals C and D. Signal D possesses a six-line super- 
hyperfine splitting, indicative of close proximity between Cr 
and A
1
 (I 
= 
5/2). The simulated spectrum, together with the 
individual components C and D, are also shown in Fig. 4 and 
the overall simulated spectrum is very close to the experimen- 
tal one. This analysis is different from that of Huang et al." in 
that two rhombic signals are revealed by simulation.

3- 
and 6. These signals are also observable in the Q-band 
spectra, although the 6- and /?-signals are very weak. The 6- 
and /?-signals can be simulated by using appropriate simula- 
tion parameters, which are summarized in Table 3. The 
obtained values for the zero field parameters, D and E, were 
obtained by careful inspection of the g us. D 
or g us. the ratio 
DIE plots of Fig. 7. These plots were theoretically generated 
with the simulation programs by using the following param- 
eters: frequency, f 
= 9.580 GHz; spin, S = 3/2; step angle, 
do = 
0.1; linewidths, w, = 
w,, = 
w, = 10 G and theoretical g- 
values, gx = 
g,, 
= 
gz = 1.970. 
The P-signal is best fitted by using D 
and E equal to zero, 
while simulation of the 6-signal requires the use of high values 
of D and E(D = 
0.490 cm-' and E = 
0.163 cm-I). The differ- 
ences in positions of the 6-signal for Cr/Al,O,, Cr/SiO, and 
Cr/SiO,. Al,O, 
catalysts can be simulated by introducing 
small variations in the theoretical g-values. Because the Cr 
ions are located at the surface, they are subject to large and 
non-uniform distortions from octahedral/tetrahedral sym- 
metry and consequently the spectra cover several thousand 
b 
Gauss. Therefore, we have superimposed relatively large line- 
widths on each resonance. An example of simulated spectra of 
the p- and &signal is given in Fig. 8. The /?-signal is a broad 
isotropic signal with g-values near 2. The 6-signal is character- 
ized by a positive absorption around g = 
4.3, together with a 
weaker isotropic signal ca. g = 
2. The signals at lower g-values 
are due to some simulation noise and are the result of the use 
of a relatively high do-value in the simulation procedure. 
By appropriate summation of the individually simulated y-, 
6- and /?-signal, the X- and Q-band spectra of Fig. 5 can be 
reconstructed. This is shown in Fig. 6, and the simulated 
spectra fit the experimental ones. Such an approach is new 
and gives strong support for the proposed EPR parameters. 
The same procedure can be done for the spectra of Cr/SiO, 
and Cr/SiO, - A1,0, catalysts and there are only minor differ- 
ences in the exact position of the &signal and the relative 
ratio of the intensities of the different signals. The shape of the 
experimental 6-signal, however, cannot be exactly obtained by 
spectrum simulation, not even by the summation of a set of 
6-signals with slightly different EPR parameters. 
The X- and Q-band EPR spectra of as-synthesized 
CrAPO-5 molecular sieves are shown in Fig. 9. The X-band

EPR spectra of CrAPO-5 molecular sieves at 300 K: (A) 
cover the assignment and the possible coordination environ- 
ments of the different signals. 
Coordination 
environments of EPR 
active Cr5+ 
The axial/rhombic form of the EPR signals of Cr5+ 
indicates 
an anisotropy of the g factor. In other words, Cr5+ 
is located 
in a crystalline field whose symmetry is lower than octahedral 
or tetrahedral. In addition, the EPR signals are quenched in 
the presence of molecular oxygen owing to dipole-dipole 
interactions. This observation is indicative for surface Cr' + 
species. Furthermore, the SQUID measurements proof the 
mononuclear character of these surface species. 
The assignment of the different Cr5+ 
signals can be carried 
out by comparison with EPR parameters of Cr5+ 
compounds 
with known structure. The g-values of some Cr5+ reference 
compounds are given in Table 4. On this basis, we can con- 
clude that Cr5+ on alumina and silica-alumina is square 
pyramidal coordinated, whereas Cr5 
+ on silica on mordenite 
are present in distorted tetrahedal coordination. The exact 
symmetry of the latter species must be C,, 
or lower (e.g. CJ. 
The (pseudo-) tetrahedral coordination of Cr5+ 
may be due 
to the replacement of Si4+ by Cr5+ 
in the oxygen tetrahedra 
of the silicagel or mordenite framework. In the case of morde- 
nite, aluminium is in close proximity as evidenced by the 
superhyperfine splitting. Cr5 
+ on alumina occupies octahedral 
defects giving rise to a square pyramidal coordination. Cr5+ 
on silica-alumina has similar g-values as on alumina, suggest- 
ing that this ion is located in the alumina regions of the silica- 
alumina support. In other words, CrS+ ions have a strong 
preference for alumina. Additional evidence for this strong 
interaction is the unresolved superhyperfine splitting of alu- 
minium in the EPR spectra of Cr/Al,O, . 
Fig. 10 Simulated EPR spectra of CrAPO-5 molecular sieves: 
X-band spectrum and (B) Q-band spectrum 
2.0 (species C) and a signal with a positive absorption around 
g = 
4.3 (species D). The corresponding Q-band EPR spectrum 
is characterized by an intense signal ca. g = 
2.0. The same 
analysis can be applied as discussed above and the EPR- 
parameters of signals C and D, obtained by spectrum simula- 
tion, are summarized in Table 3. The corresponding simulated 
spectra are given in Fig. 10 and there is an excellent agree- 
ment between the experimental and the simulated X- 
and 
Q-band EPR-spectra. It is also remarkable to see that almost 
the same simulation parameters, used for simulating the ESR 
spectra of supported Cr catalysts, can be used to simulate the 
EPR spectra of the CrAPO-5 molecular sieves. 
Discussion 
The extensive use of simulation procedures enable us to 
gather in this paper for the first time detailed parameters from 
the complex and overlapping EPR spectra of heterogeneous 
Cr catalysts. The obtained parameters, arising from specific 
coordination geometries of Cr3 
+ and Cr5 
+ ions in inorganic 
oxides, are somewhat similar for the different supports. These 
observations merit a more detailed discussion, which will 
Coordination environments of EPR 
active Cr3 ' 
Two different EPR signals of Cr3+ 
ions are present in amorph- 
ous and crystalline inorganic oxides : 
a broad signal with g ca. 
2 and zero field parameters D and E equal to 0 cm-' 
and a 
signal with a positive lobe in the region g = 
3.5-5.5 with D 
and E equal to 0.490 and 0.163 cm-', 
respectively. 
The isotropic signal of Cr3+ 
with g ca. 2 is well documented 
in the literature and due to Cr3+ in nearly octahedral coordi- 
nation, either in a hexa-aquo complex or clustered form.,' 
The other signal has rather unusual EPR parameters and, 
consequently, comparison with model compounds is dimcult. 
However, in this work we were able to put for the first time 
numbers on the zero field parameters D and E of the b-signal, 
which must be due to a surface Cr species. Indeed, the large

of a very distorted Cr3+ 
site. Additional evidence for this con- 
clusion comes from the Q-band spectra, which are always 
rather weak. This weakness is due to g- and/or D-strain, which 
may cause broadening of the signals. This is more severe at 
higher microwave frequencies and such coordinations are 
therefore much more compatible with surface than with bulk 
sites. The same reasoning holds for the D signal of CrAPO-5 
molecular sieves and means that the EPR active Cr3+ in

CrAPO-5 molecular sieves cannot be assigned to iso- 
morphously substituted Cr3 
+. This conclusion resolves a 
debate in the literature about the possibility to incorporate 
Cr3 
+ in the framework of molecular 
Conclusions 
Spin-Hamiltonian operators for each of the EPR Cr3+/5+ 
resonance signals were proposed and discussed in this paper. 
A comparative analysis shows that the nature of Cr5+ and 
Cr3+ species in heterogeneous catalysts is, on the whole, 
somewhat similar, independently of the synthesis method and 
the type of inorganic oxide. This comparative analysis was 
made possible by the extensive use of spectrum simulations 
and by measuring EPR spectra both in X- and Q-band. 
Mononuclear Cr5+ ions are axial on alumina and silica- 
alumina, and rhombic on silica and mordenite. Two different 
types of Cr3+ ions are observed on inorganic surfaces : 
clus- 
tered Cr3 
+ or octahedral Cr3 
+ complexes, both characterized 
by zero field parameters D and E almost equal to 0 and a 
strongly distorted Cr3+ 
complex with large values of D 
and E. 
On that basis we conclude that CrAPO-5 molecular sieves do 
not contain isomorphously substituted Cr3 
+.
