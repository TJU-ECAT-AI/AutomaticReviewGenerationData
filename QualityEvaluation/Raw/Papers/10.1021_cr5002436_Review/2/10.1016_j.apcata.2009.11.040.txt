1. Introduction
Dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been
investigated recently as a new way for obtaining propene from its
low cost and poorly reactive saturated analogue, propane. In this
process, propene can be obtained with higher yield than in the
non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This positive effect
of CO2 is explained by its participation in direct oxidation of
propane to propene (C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O) and hydro-
gen
consumption
by
reverse
water–gas
shift
reaction
(CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O), which shifts propane dehydrogenation
equilibrium. Moreover, the side beneﬁt of the new process is
utilization of CO2 that is converted to useful co-product, carbon
monoxide.
In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide
materials were investigated as catalysts [1–23]. Among them,
much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium
oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and
stable in the process with CO2 [1,4–7,9–22]. Furthermore, it has
been found that the over the latter mentioned catalysts positive
effect exerted by CO2 is different. In the case of gallium oxide-
based catalysts, CO2 suppresses partially deactivation by coke
formation and enhances the yield of propene by removal of H2 that
is formed in the dehydrogenation reaction [17–19]. The experi-
mental data has been conﬁrmed recently by DFT study, which
revealed that over Ga2O3, in the presence of CO2, the main route of
propene formation is the dehydrogenation of propane, while
oxidative dehydrogenation is energetically less workable [24]. In
contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting
effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities.
It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13].
The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-
based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+),
whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading,
the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium
and nature of support. In the case of SiO2-supported chromium
oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of
chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings,
where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr
loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as
well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.

A B S T R A C T
A series of the Cr-containing SBA-1 (xCrSBA1) cubic mesoporous catalysts with various Cr/Si molar ratios
have been prepared by direct method using cetyltriethylammonium bromide, ammonium dichromate,
tetraethyl orthosilicate and hydrochloric acid. The obtained materials have been characterized by
different physicochemical techniques including ICP, XRD, UV–vis DRS, H2-TPR and N2-adsorption. XRD
and N2-adsorption results have revealed that xCrSBA1 materials possess well organized three-
dimensional pore structure. However, incorporation of Cr into the SBA-1 framework leads to small
perturbation of the structural order. ICP results have shown that the amount of Cr incorporation in SBA-1
can be controlled by adjustment of the molar ratio of (NH4)2Cr2O7 to Si(C2H5O)4 in the gel. Finally, the
catalytic activity of pure SBA-1 and Cr-containing SBA-1 materials were investigated in the
dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. In the case of the most active, 0.04CrSBA1 catalyst, the effect
of various reaction parameters such as, reaction temperature, reaction time and feed gas composition on
the conversion of propane, yield and selectivity to propene as well as on molar ratio of CO/H2 has been
evaluated. Moreover, stability of the catalyst during the dehydrogenation/regeneration conditions was
studied as well. It has been found that during the fourth consecutive cycle the catalyst undergoes two
types of deactivation processes – reversible and irreversible. The former is caused mainly by the coke
deposition, which can easily overcome by air treatment of the catalyst at 550 8C. The latter one,
insigniﬁcant, is due to partial collapse of mesoporous structure of the catalysts.

Taking to assume above it could be conclude that in order to
obtain more active chromium oxide-based catalyst for the
dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 a high dispersion of the
chromium oxide species at Cr lodgings as high as possible should
be achieved. From those reasons, more attention has been
dedicated recently toward mesoporous sieves. A large surface
area (>1000 m2 g1) of the mesoporous materials makes it
possible to create much higher number of the redox Cr species
in compare with traditional SiO2-supports. Several recent inves-
tigations have shown that Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have
an excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to
propene with and without CO2 [5,11,13–15].
The newly discovered SBA-1 mesoporous silica material has
high potential to be applied as a catalyst support, because of its
unique textural properties. In particular, it has a three-dimensional
channels (Pm3n) ranging from 2.1 to 2.6 nm and speciﬁc surface
area in the range 1200–1450 m2 g1. Such three-dimensional pore
network is more resistant to pore blocking, they provide more
adsorption sites due to their high surface area and the pores can be
easily accessible to reactant molecules [25]. Moreover, cubic
mesoporous phase is mechanically more stable compared to
hexagonal mesoporous materials, such as: SBA-15 and MCM-41
[26]. The latter feature is important for industrial applications
where the catalyst powders are subjected to shaping process.
Although SBA-1 materials possess interesting structural prop-
erties the studies concerning their application in catalysis are
limited, compared with other mesoporous materials such as
hexagonal MCM-41 or SBA-15. Up to now, only a few efforts have
been made to incorporate Cr [27] or other heteroatoms like Ga [25],
Ti [28–30], V [31,32], Co [33], Al [34,35] Mo [36] and Fe [28,37–39],
Pd [40] into the SBA-1 for catalytic purpose. The main reasons for
that is difﬁculty with preparation of template with large head-
groups (e.g. alkyltriethylammonium bromide) and incorporation
of heteroatoms (mainly in cationic form) into the SBA-1 frame-
works under strong acidic conditions.
In this work we investigated the catalytic activity of Cr-
containing SBA-1 catalysts (xCrSBA1) with different Cr loadings,
prepared by the direct method. All the xCrSBA1 catalysts were
characterized by various techniques such as X-ray diffraction
(XRD), diffusion reﬂectance, N2-adsorption and temperature-
programmed reduction experiments (H2-TPR). Finally, the catalyt-
ic performance of the xCrSBA1 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of
propane to propene with CO2 was evaluated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Surfactant preparation
Hexadecyltriethylammonium bromide (HTEABr) was synthe-
sized by reaction of 1-bromohexadecane (97%, Aldrich) with an
equimolar amount of triethylamine (98%, Fluka) in ethanol (99.8%,
Chempur) under reﬂux for 72 h. The surfactant cetyltriethylam-
monium bromide (CTEABr) was puriﬁed by recrystallization from
chloroform/ethyl acetate mixture [41].
2.2. Synthesis of mesoporous CrSBA-1 catalysts
The catalysts were prepared under acidic conditions using
cetyltriethylammonium bromide as the surfactant, tetraethyl
orthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica source and ammonium dichro-
mate as the chromium source according to the modiﬁed procedure
described in [27]. In a typical synthesis, 10 g of CTEABr, 1157 cm3
of distilled water and 566 cm3 of hydrochloric acid (37%, Chempur)
were combined with 0.158–1.58 g of ammonium dichromate (99%,
Chempur) to form a homogeneous solution, which was cooled to
0 8C and stirred for 30 min. Then 27.90 cm3 of TEOS (98% Aldrich),
precooled to 0 8C was added, while vigorous stirring. The molar
composition of the reaction mixture was TEOS:CTEABr:HCl:-
H2O:(NH4)2Cr2O7 = 1:0.2:56:700:(0.005–0.05). Stirring was con-
tinued for 6 h until the precipitation of the silica-chromium-
surfactant assemblies was completed. The resultant precipitate
was ﬁltered off and dried (without washing) at 60 8C overnight. The
dried material was then calcined in air by rising temperature from
ambient to 550 8C over 9 h and keeping it at 550 8C for another
12 h. The samples were labeled xCrSBA1 where x denotes the Cr/Si
ratio in the gel (x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.1).
2.3. Catalyst characterization
XRD patterns were recorded in two ranges of 0.5–108 and 10–708
(2u) at room temperature, using a Panalytical X’Pert Pro instrument
operated at 40 kV and 30 mA, equipped with a Cu Ka X-ray source.
The crystals size of Cr2O3 was calculated based on Scherrer formula
using the Rietveld method in the TOPAS R2.1 program.
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at
196 8C using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 instrument. The
samples were degassed at 250 8C before measurements. Speciﬁc
surface areas were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method within the relative pressure range P/P0 = 0.05–0.15.
Pore size distributions were calculated from the branch of the
desorption curve using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model.
Pore volumes were obtained from the volumes of nitrogen
adsorbed at P/P0 = 0.95 or vicinity.
Diffusion reﬂectance UV–vis spectra (UV–vis DRS) were taken
on an Ocean Optics HR2000+ instrument (integration time 400 ms,
100 scans) equipped with an Ocean Optics DH-2000 BAL halogen-
deuterium light source and optical ﬁber probe (FCR-7UV400A-
2ME-HTX) at room temperature. The spectra were recorded within
the wavelength range of 220–800 nm using BaSO4 as a standard.
Temperature-programmed reduction, using H2 as the reducing
agent was carried out in a modiﬁed gas chromatograph with a
thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Puriﬁed mixture of N2/H2
(95/5 vol.%, Air Liquide) served as a combined carrier and reducing
gas at a total ﬂow rate 30 cm3 min1. Before experiment the
catalyst sample (100 mg) was preheated in a dry He stream at
550 8C for 30 min, and then cooled to room temperature. The
sample was heated at 10 8C min1 to the ﬁnal temperature of
650 8C.
The
H2
consumption
was
measured
by
a
thermal
conductivity detector and NiO (99.998%, Aldrich) was used as a
reference for the calibration of H2 consumption.
ICP spectrometry (Perkin Elmer ELAN 6100) was applied for
quantitative determination of chromium content. The samples
were dissolved in a mixture of HF and HNO3.
2.4. Catalytic tests
The dehydrogenation of propane (Linde, 99.6 vol.%) in the
presence of CO2 (Linde, 99.96 vol.%) was carried out in ﬂow-type
quartz reactor packed with 200 mg of the catalyst (grain size 0.2–
0.3 mm). The dehydrogenation feed consisted of a mixture of
CO2:C3H8:He = 10:1:4, 5:1:9, 1:1:13 and 0:1:14. The total ﬂow rate
was 30 cm3 min1. The catalyst was preheated in a stream of dry
argon (Linde, 99.999 vol.%) for 0.5 h at 550 8C before the catalytic
tests. The reaction was started in the 500–650 8C temperature range
at atmospheric pressure. The reactants and products were analyzed
on-line using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) equipped with
two columns (Hayesep Q and molecular sieve 5A) and a thermal
conductivity detector. The column packed with Hayesep Q was used
for the quantiﬁcation of H2, CO2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8. The
molecular sieve 5A was used for the quantiﬁcation of CH4 and CO.
The conversion of propane, yield of propene and selectivity to all
hydrocarbon products were calculated as described previously [13].

Coke amounts were estimated from the amounts of CO2 and CO
evolved during oxidative regeneration of the catalysts at 600 8C in
air.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalysts characterization
Fig. 1A and B display the XRD patterns recorded for pure and Cr-
containing SBA-1 materials in two different regions of 2u angles. In
the 2u range of 1–108 three diffraction lines are observed (Fig. 1A).
These lines are indexed to the (2 0 0), (2 1 0) and (2 1 1) reﬂections,
characteristic of the cubic Pm3n mesostructure [26,39]. The
intensity of the diffraction lines for the xCrSBA1 catalysts decreases
as the Cr-containing materials increases. However, even in the case
of the 0.1CrSBA1 catalyst the diffraction lines characteristic for the
cubic structure are still observed.
In the 2u range of 10–708, the diffraction lines, corresponding to
the crystal phase of a-Cr2O3 are detected for the catalysts with the
Cr/Si atomic ratio 0.04, 0.06 and 0.1 (Fig. 1B). The crystallite size of
a-Cr2O3 calculated from Scherrer formula (the last column in
Table 1) is in the range between 17 and 31 nm. These values are
much higher than mesopore size of Cr-containing SBA-1 materials
indicating that in all cases the particles of a-Cr2O3 are formed
outside of mesochannels. The absence of the diffraction line in the
samples with lower Cr/Si atomic ratio may be explained either by
Cr dispersion or smaller size of the Cr2O3 crystals.
Textural properties of the calcined catalysts were characterized
by low temperature adsorption of nitrogen. The calculated speciﬁc
surface area, pore volume and average pore size are summarized in
Table 1.
Mesoporous SBA-1 and the xCrSBA1 catalysts show uniform pore
size with the pore diameter within the narrow range between 2.4
and 2.6 nm, as calculated by the BJH method. The speciﬁc surface
area and pore volume decrease with increase in the Cr/Si atomic
ratio. The monotonic decrease of the textural parameters and the
XRD lines intensity drop suggest small destruction of the structural
regularity of the mesoporous structure with increase of the Cr
content.
Furthermore, diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy in UV–vis range
was applied for the investigation of oxidation state of chromium
species in the calcined samples (Fig. 2).
The range 200–800 nm is useful for diagnostic of Cr6+ in
tetrahedral and Cr3+ in octahedral symmetry [42]. Two main
absorption bands at 270 and 365 nm appear for all the samples.
These bands were assigned to Cr6+–O2 charge transfer transition
of chromate species [42,43]. A shoulder at around 460 nm is also
shown, ascribed to dichromate or polychromates arrangement in a
contact with the support [43]. The spectra of the 0.04CrSBA1,
0.06CrSBA1 and 0.1CrSBA1 catalysts show additionally band at
around 600 nm due to the A2g ! T2g transition of Cr3+ in octahedral
symmetry. Speciﬁcally, the band at 600 nm is assigned to a d–d
charge transfer transition in a strongly distorted octahedral crystal
ﬁeld [44]. This absorption band does not appear in the spectra of
Fig. 1. XRD patterns of pure SBA-1 and fresh xCrSBA1 catalysts.

the calcined 0.01CrSBA1 and 0.02CrSBA1 samples, indicating that
Cr6+ species are predominant in the case of the catalysts with a low
Cr content, while in the 0.04CrSBA1, 0.06CrSBA1 and 0.1CrSBA1
catalysts both Cr6+ and Cr3+ coexist. Moreover, the intensity of the
band at 600 nm increases with the increase of Cr content indicating
that the concentration of Cr3+ species increase with the rise of Cr
content. The UV–vis results reﬂect in the colour of the catalyst that
turns from bright yellow in the case of 0.01CrSBA1 to dark green for
the 0.1CrSBA1 catalyst.
Fig. 3 displays temperature-programmed reduction proﬁles of
the fresh xCrSBA1 catalysts.
The reduction effects depend on the Cr content. The H2-TPR
proﬁles of the 0.01CrSBA1 and 0.02CrSBA1 catalysts show single
reduction maximum at ca. 466 and 445 8C, respectively, while the
proﬁles of the catalysts with higher Cr content (0.04CrSBA1,
0.06CrSBA1 and 0.1CrSBA1) exhibit an additional low temperature
reduction maximum at around 276 8C with a shoulder ca. at 320 8C.
These H2-TPR results are in agreement with those reported earlier.
Zhao and Wang [27] have observed also only one reduction
maximum in the case of CrSBA-1 catalysts with the Cr content
below 2 wt.% and two maxima (high and low temperature) for the
samples with the higher Cr content. In the presented work the
additional very weak shoulder of low temperature maximum was
found. It is clearly seen after 4 magniﬁcation in the TPR curve for
sample with the highest Cr content. This small difference in the
redox behaviour could be caused by distinct preparation condi-
tions, e.g. by the calcination temperature (550 8C instead 600 8C).
The intensity of the low temperature maxima increases with
increase of the Cr content in the catalysts, whereas the high
temperature maximum at ca. 445 8C gradually decreases. The
location of the low temperature maxima coincided well with the
reduction maximum observed for a-Cr2O3, which are assigned to
the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ [45] or Cr2+ [46] species dispersed on
a-Cr2O3. The high temperature maximum that is observed for all of
the xCrSBA1 catalysts is assigned to the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+
species directly attached to the silica materials (Cr6+/SBA-1) [46].
Moreover, the latter maximum shifted to lower values as the Cr
content in the catalyst increased from 0.7 to 1.8. This Tmax shifting
can be attributed to the change in the polymerization degree of
Cr6+ species with rise of Cr concentration in the catalysts.
Results of the calculation of hydrogen consumption and the
molar ratio of H2/CrICP for each catalyst sample, on the basis of the
total area under TPR peaks and the amount of CrICP are summarized
in Table 1. The amounts of Cr6+ species directly bonded with SBA-1
to those attached to a-Cr2O3 (LCr6þ=HCr6þ) are presented as well
(the last column in Table
1). The values of LCr6þ=HCr6þ were
estimated on the basis of mathematical deconvolution of the
experimental H2-TPR curves. The total H2 consumption increases
with the increase of Cr content up to 3.5 wt.% and then declines,
while the ratio of H2/CrICP drops from 1.60 to 0.21 as the Cr content
is increased from 0.7 to 0.9 wt.% of Cr. This drop of the H2/CrICP ratio
with the increase of Cr content is due to formation of crystalline a-
Cr2O3. Similar drop of the H2/CrICP ratio with the increase of Cr
loading we observed previously [13] in the case of MCM-41
supported chromium oxide catalysts.
Taking into account the H2-TPR results, it can be concluded that
in the xCrSBA-1 catalysts obtained by the direct method two types
of the Cr6+ species with different reducibility are presented. The
Cr6+/SBA-1 species are harder to reduce compared to Cr6+/a-Cr2O3
species. At low loadings the Cr6+ species directly attached to the
silica supports (Cr6+/SBA-1) dominate, whereas at higher Cr
contents
both
Cr6+/SBA-1
and
Cr6+/a-Cr2O3
species
coexist.
Moreover, the presence of low temperature maxima conﬁrms
the existence of Cr2O3 in the catalysts 0.04CrSBA1, 0.06CrSBA1 and
0.1CrSBA1, which stays in agreement with the XRD and UV–vis
DRS results.
The formation of crystalline a-Cr2O3 and polychromates (see
Fig. 2, the bands at 460 nm) in the fresh catalysts indicates that the
part of chromium precursor is weekly dispersed in the SBA-1
matrix. Zhao and Wang [27] have suggested the reason of that is
tendency of Cr2O7
2 anions to polymerization under strong acid
conditions (pH < 2). Moreover, it is known that not only decreasing
of the pH but also increasing the chromium species concentration
results in the formation of more polymerized chromium species
like tri- (Cr3O10
2) and tetrachromates (Cr4O13
2) [44]. Such
polychromates interact weakly with the SBA-1 support and during
thermal treatment they are decompose to a-Cr2O3.

3.2. Dehydrogenation activity
The catalytic performance of pure and Cr-containing SBA-1
materials was investigated in the dehydrogenation of propane with
CO2 at 550 8C. The variation of the initial conversion of propane and
selectivity to propene with the Cr content is displayed in Fig. 4A.
Pure siliceous SBA-1 is inactive in the dehydrogenation of
propane with CO2. In the series of xCrSBA1 catalysts the conversion
of propane increased with the increase of Cr content up to 4.3 wt.%
and for the sample with the highest Cr content declined. The lower
catalytic activity of the 0.1CrSBA1 catalyst can be explained by its
lower cubic regularitycaused byincorporation ofthe highamount of
Cr. Moreover, selectivity to propene over pure SBA-1 is very low,
while increasing dramatically after incorporation of Cr into the SBA-
1 framework.
In accordance with earlier observation [17,22,45–47], the
dehydrogenating activity of chromium oxide-based materials in
the presence andabsenceofCO2 are stronglyaffectedbythe redoxCr
species (Crred). It has been proposed that the Cr6+ and Cr5+ species
present on the surface of calcined supported chromium oxide
catalysts are precursors for redox Cr3+ species, which are very active
in dehydrogenation of alkanes [46,47]. Contrary to the simple
dehydrogenation, in the presence of CO2 oxidative dehydrogena-
tion/hydrogenation pathways are activated over Crred. So far, several
different redox cycles including Cr6+/Cr3+ [10,48], Cr5+/Cr3+ [49] or
Cr3+/Cr2+ [50], have been proposed for explanation of CO2 effect in
the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Taking that into account, the
variation of the yield of propene with the number of Crred in the
xCrSBA1 catalysts was investigated (Fig. 4B). The number of Crred
species was calculated from hydrogen consumption (see Table 1,
H2-TPR results) by assuming that hydrogen is consumed only in the
reduction of Cr6+ (2CrO3 + 3H2 = Cr2O3 + 3H2O, 1.5 mmol H2/mol
Cr6+), and that the reduction of both Cr6+/SBA-1 and Cr6+/Cr2O3/SBA-
1 species yields selectively Cr3+. The increase of propene yield with
the number of Crred species is consistent with the previous results
[13]. However, there is no fully linear correlation, which indicates
that the dehydrogenating properties are attributed not only to the
redox but also to nonredox Cr species.

Fig.
5 presents the variation of the catalytic performance at
different feed gas compositions with time-on-stream (TOS) at
550 8C.
With the increase of molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 yield of propene,
selectivity to propene and molar ratio of H2/CO increase. As it has
been pointed in the introduction, CO2 enhances the yield of
propene by two ways (i) direct oxidation of propane to propene
(C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O) and (ii) hydrogen consumption by
reverse water–gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O), which
shifts
propane
dehydrogenation
equilibrium.
Thus,
in
the
dehydrogenation process with CO2 beside propene, the main
useful by-products are CO and H2 are produced, which separately
or together (as synthesis gas) ﬁnd many applications in chemical
synthesis. From Fig. 5 it can be seen that the regulation of feed gas
composition (i.e., CO2/propane molar ratio) gives a possibility to
control the molar ratio of H2/CO. The mixture rich in CO is
obtained at high initial molar ratio of CO2/C3H8, while at the low
ratio of CO2/C3H8 the gas pure with CO is formed. It should be
pointed out that synthesis gas with the ratio of H2/CO between 1:1
and 3:1 or higher is widely applied in chemical industry. The high
H2/CO ratios of the order of 2–3 are suitable for Fischer–Tropsch
synthesis, production of methanol and dimethyl ether, while the
synthesis gas with lower H2/CO ratios (around 1:1) is useful for
OXO process.
Furthermore, in the case of 0.04CrSBA1 catalyst, the effect of
reaction temperature on the catalyst performances was investi-
gated. The initial conversion, yield of propene, and selectivity to all
hydrocarbon products are summarized in Table 2.
Both the conversion of propane and the yield of propene
increase with the rise of the reaction temperature while the
selectivity to propene gradually drops. In the same time, the
selectivity to by-products (i.e. methane, ethene and ethane) rise as
the temperature increase, indicating facilitation of side reactions,
like cracking and hydrocracking, at high temperatures. Moreover,
the rise of the reaction temperature enhances the molar ratio of
useful by-products, H2/CO.
Fig.
6 shows the variation of propane and carbon dioxide
conversion with time-on-stream (TOS) at 500, 550, 600 and 650 8C
over the 0.04CrSBA1 catalyst.
In all the reaction temperatures the conversion of propane and
carbon dioxide drops with the TOS. This unfavorable phenomenon
is caused mainly by the coke deposition, which is accelerated at
high temperatures. The deactivation data for the 0.04CrSBA1
catalyst at different temperature are summarized in Table 3. The
results obtained for that catalyst in the absence of CO2 at 550 8C are
summarized as well.
A % activity loss, represented by the difference between the
initial and the ﬁnal conversion of propane, rises as the reaction

temperature increases. Similarly, the increase of the reaction
temperature enhances the amount of coke deposited on the
catalyst surface and the number of propane molecules converted to
coke. Moreover, after the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2
over 0.04CrSBA1 catalyst, the coke amount is higher then after the
process without CO2 (third column of Table 3). The latter result is
consistent with the results of previous investigations concerning
different silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts [10]. Larger
coke amount observed in atmosphere of CO2 than in inert gas
atmosphere can be explained by higher reactivity of propene
compared to propane. As suggested by Takehira et al. [10] coke is
produced more intensely on the catalyst from propene than from
propane, thus the enhanced formation of propene results in a
larger amount of coke. This also indicates that CO2 is not an
effective gasiﬁcation agent. Hence, under the dehydrogenation
process conditions CO2 cannot suppress the catalyst deactivation
by Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C = 2CO).
Furthermore, the comparison of the deactivation data obtained
for processes in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 8C reveals
that despite of lower amount of coke, in the inert gas atmosphere
the catalyst is deactivated faster than in the presence of CO2 (see
also Fig. 6). Such behaviour suggests that the additional reason for
the deactivation is reduction of active sites of 0.04CrSBA1 catalyst.
Such reduction is slower in the presence of CO2 that helps maintain
higher oxidation state of the chromium catalysts during the
process.
Fig. 7 presents the catalytic performance of 0.04CrSBA1 catalyst
in consecutive dehydrogenation–regeneration–puriﬁcation cycles.
In the dehydrogenation step, the conversion of propane drops
gradually with the TOS due to coke deposition and the reduction of
active sites on the catalysts surface. This unfavorable phenomenon
can be removed by treatment of the catalyst with air in the short
regeneration step at 550 8C. However, after fourth cycle a small
drop of the catalytic performance is observed. The initial (10 min
on-stream) and ﬁnal (240 min on-stream) conversion of propane
drops from 26.7 and 16.6% in the ﬁrst dehydrogenation step to 23.5
and 14.4% in the fourth step, respectively.
N2-adsorption–desorption isotherms and BJH pore distribu-
tions of fresh and regenerated 0.04CrSBA1 catalyst after four cycles
are displayed in Fig. 8.
There is no signiﬁcant difference in the N2-isotherms shape and
pore size distributions, however speciﬁc surface area calculated by
BET (SBET) method as well as total pore volumes (Vtotal) drop from
SBET = 1025 m2 g1, Vtotal = 0.61 cm3 g1 for fresh catalysts to
SBET = 787 m2 g1, Vtotal = 0.49 for the regenerated catalyst after
four cycles. In summary, these results reveal that the irreversible
deactivation of 0.04CrSBA1 material is due to loss of textural
parameters. Lattice oxygen consumption during dehydrogenation
of propane with CO2 would have an impact on the corruption of
0.04CrSBA1 catalyst.
4. Conclusions
CrSBA-1 catalysts with the highly ordered cubic structure and
high speciﬁc surface area (SBET > 900 m2 g1) are obtained by
direct method up to Cr/Si = 0.06 atomic ratio in the gel. All Cr-
containing SBA-1 materials possess good catalytic activity and
selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The
dehydrogenation activity is proportional to the number of redox
chromium species. During the dehydrogenation of propane with
CO2, the catalysts undergo two types of deactivation processes –
reversible and irreversible. The former is caused mainly by the coke
deposition. The latter is due to partial collapse of mesoporous
structure of the catalysts.
