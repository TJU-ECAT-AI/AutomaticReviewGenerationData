Abstract
Solid-solid interactions, surface and catalystic properties of Cr2O3/Al2O3 system were investigated using TG, DTA,
XRD, nitrogen adsorption at −196°C and CO-oxidation by O2 at 250–400°C. The amount of chromium oxide was
varied between 4.3 and 42.7 wt.% Cr2O3. The results showed that heating of Al(OH)3 pretreated with different
amounts of CrO3 at 400–900°C resulted in the formation of a mixture of g-, k-,u-aluminas, Cr2O5, CrO2 and a-Cr2O3
phases. The rise in calcination temperature to 1000°C made the appearance of minute amounts of a-Al2O3 and Cr3O4
besides the other phases (a-Cr2O3 and u-, k-Al2O3). The BET-surface area decreases by increasing the precalcination
temperature in the range 400–1000°C. The mixed oxide adsorbents calcined at 400–600°C contain mainly narrow
pores and turned to wide pores upon heating at 700–1000°C. The activation energy of sintering (DEs) decreases
markedly from 21 to 7.6 kJ mol−1 by increasing the amount of Cr2O3 from 4.3 to 8.3 wt.% then increases
progressively reaching to 33 kJ mol−1 in the presence of 42.7 wt.% Cr2O3. The catalystic activity increases as a
function of Cr2O3 content. The curves relating the catalystic activity (reaction rate constant per unit surface area) and
precalcination temperature exhibited a maximum at 700 or 800°C depending on the amount of Cr2O3 present. The
rise in both Cr2O3 content and calcination temperature did not modify the mechanism of the catalystic reaction but
changed the concentration of catalystically active constituents without altering their energetic nature. © 1999 Elsevier

1. Introduction
The catalystic oxidation of CO by O2 is of
environmental and industrial importance. This re-
action is being utilized in an increasing number of
practical applications. The CO oxidation catalysts
are often an integral component of pollution con-
trol devices designed to reduce industrial and
automotive
emissions
[1,2].
Air
puriﬁcation
devices and CO gas sensors commonly employ
CO-oxidation catalysis. Recently, CO oxidation
has been utilized in closed-cycle CO2 lasers [1,3–

7], CO2 lasers must incorporate a CO-oxidation
catalyst to recombine stoichiometric concentra-
tions of CO and O2 which are produced during
the lasing process because both CO2 loss and O2
build-up can degrade the performance of the laser
[8].
The most efﬁcient CO-oxidation catalysts are
precious metals such as Pt, Pd, Rh and Au which
catalyse the CO-oxidation reaction near ambient
temperatures [9–11]. However several attempts
have been made to use base metal catalysts for the
CO oxidation to avoid the high cost of the pre-
cious metals. Multi-component catalyst systems
exhibit high catalystic performance as compared
to a single component system. These systems in-
clude manganese–silver composite oxides [12],
copper–chromium [13], CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 [14,15],
CuO/CeO2 [16] and manganese–silver composite
oxides [12].
The physicochemical effect of chromium oxide
surfaces on the adsorption behaviour of CO, CO2
and O2 has been made the object of several inves-
tigations [17,18] using IR techniques. The kinetics
of CO-oxidation by O2 over unloaded chromium
oxide have been investigated by few investigators
[19,20]. Kobayshi [21] proposed two reaction path
ways for CO oxidation by O2 on Cr2O3 catalysts
which distinguish between two types of active sites
with different ligands to the Cr3+ ion like OH or
O2−or with different degree of co-ordination
unsaturation of the Cr3+ ion [17].
The effect of g-irradition on surface and cata-
lystic properties of Cr2O3/Al2O3 was the object of
our recent investigations [22] which showed that
this treatment caused signiﬁcant modiﬁcations in
the catalytic activity, in CO oxidation by O2 of
the Cr2O3/Al2O3 system. These modiﬁcations de-
pended on the precalcination temperature of the
treated solids.
The present work aimed to investigate the role
of Cr2O3 content and precalcination temperature
of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 system on its physicochemical,
surface and catalystic properties. The techniques
employed were XRD, nitrogen adsorption at −
196°C and CO-oxidation by O2 over various cata-
lyst samples.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Five Cr2O3/Al2O3 samples containing 4.3, 8.2,
15.7, 27.1 and 42.7 wt.% Cr2O3 were prepared by
mixing a known mass of ﬁnely powdered Al(OH)3
with a calculated amount of CrO3 solid, followed
by drying at 120°C and calcination in air at
400–1000°C for 6 h. These samples were desig-
nated AlCr-I, AlCr-II, AlCr-III, AlCr-IV and
AlCr-V, respectively. The Al(OH)3 solid employed
was prepared by precipition from Al(NO3)3 solu-
tion using 0.2 M NH4OH at 70°C and at a pH of
8. The precipitate was washed with distilled water
and dried at 120°C to constant weight. The chem-
icals employed were of analytical grade as sup-
plied by the Prolabo company.
2.2. Techniques
TG, DTA and dDTA curves of uncalcined
materials were done using Perkin–Elmer, Seven
series thermal analysis system. The rate of heating
was kept at 10°C min−1 and masses of the solid
specimens were 10 and 40 mg in the case of TG
and DTA runs, respectively. The measurements
were carried out in a current of N2 ﬂowing at a
rate of 50 cm3 min−1.
The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of vari-
ous calcined samples were measured using a
Philips diffractometer (type PW 1390). The pat-
terns were run with nickel-ﬁltered copper radia-
tion (l=1.5405 A
˚ ) at 36 kV and 16 mA with a
scanning speed of 2° in 2u min−1.
The surface properties, i.e. the values of SBET,
Vp and r
) for the various calcined samples were
determined from N2 adsorption isotherms mea-
sured at −196°C using conventional volumetric
apparatus. Before carrying out such measurments,
each sample was degassed under a reduced pres-
sured of 10−5 Torr for 2 h at 200°C.
The catalytic oxidation of CO by O2 was car-
ried out on various catalysts at temperatures be-
tween 250 and 400°C using a static method. A
fresh 400 mg catalyst sample was employed for
each kinetic experiment and was activated by
heating at 350°C for 2 h under a reduced pressure

of 10−6 Torr. The kinetics of the catalytic reac-
tion were monitored by measuring the pressure of
the reaction mixture (2 Torr of CO+ 1/2O2) at
different time intervals until equilibrium was at-
tained. The reaction product (CO2) was removed
from the reaction atmosphere by freezing in a
liquid nitrogen trap so the percentage decrease in
the pressure of the reaction gases at a given
interval gives the percentage conversion of the
catalystic reaction at that time.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Thermal beha6iour of uncalcined mixed solids
The DTA curves of uncalcined AlCr-II, AlCr-
III, AlCr-IV and AlCr-V solid samples consist of
four endothermic peaks followed by ﬁve mass loss
processes. Fig. 1 shows representative TG, DTA
and dDTA curves of the AlCr-III sample. The
maxima of the recorded endothermic peaks of
different investigated samples are located at 75–
96, 192–232, 305–321 and 499–504°C. The ﬁrst
set of peaks correspond to the departure of phy-
sisorbed water. The second and third sets of peaks
characterized the transformation of CrO3 to lower
valence chromic oxide and dehydroxylation of
Al(OH)3 yielding Al2O3. The last set of peaks are
indicative to removal of strongly bound OH
groups of Al2O3 lattice [23,24]. The complete re-
moval of these groups requires a prolonged heat-
ing at ]900°C [25] or exposure of suitable dose
of g-rays [26]. In fact, all investigated mixed solids
exhibited a slow mass loss process by heating at
temperatures between 504 and 1000°C followed
H.G. El-Shobaky et al. / Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochem. Eng. Aspects 152 (1999) 315–326
318
by mass loss of 2.14, 2.64, 2.69 and 5.4 wt.% for
AlCr-II, AlCr-III, AlCr-IV and AlCr-V, respec-
tively. This process might indicate the complete
removal of OH groups from the Al2O3 lattice
besides a possible formation of lower valence
chromic oxides (Cr3O4). The formation of Cr3O4
in the calcined solids heated at 1000°C will be
conﬁrmed by XRD analysis.
3.2. XRD of calcination products of different
mixed solids
XR-diffraction patterns of AlCr mixed solids
precalcined at 400, 600, 800, 900 and 1000°C were
conducted. Table 1 includes the crystalline phase
compositions of the calcined products detected by
XRD. It is seen from Table 1 that the different
mixed solids calcined at 400°C consist of a mix-
ture of poorly crystalline g-Al2O3 and different
forms of chromic oxide (a-Cr2O3, Cr2O5 and
CrO2). The formation of these oxides takes place
according to:
Cr2O5+1/2 O2
2CrO3

400oC
Cr2O5
2CrO2+1/2 O2

400oC
2CrO2
Cr2O3+1/2 O2

400oC
2CrO3
Cr2O3+3/2 O2

400oC
It can also be seen from Table 1 that Cr2O3
phase did not exist in AlCr-II and AlCr-III speci-
mens precalcined at 400°C, Cr2O5 and CrO2
phases were only present. The rise in calcination
temperature of AlCr-I and AlCr-II samples to 600
or 800°C brought about a complete disappearance
of chromium oxide phases probably due to their
effective dispersion on the alumina surface besides
a possible location of chromium species in octa-
and tetrahedral sites of Al2O3 with subsequent
formation
of
two-dimensional
chromium
alu-
minium compound. The increase in calcination
temperature of different mixed solid samples to
900°C resulted in the formation of k- and u-
aluminas which turned in part to a-Al2O3 upon
heating at 1000°C. This treatment led also to the
formation of Cr3O4 besides Cr2O3. However, the
existence of Cr3O4 phases was only detected in the
mixed solids relatively rich in chromium oxide
(AlCr-III, AlCr-IV and AlCr-V) samples.
3.3. Surface properties of 6arious mixed solids
The different surface characteristics of various
Cr2O3/Al2O3 solids preheated at temperatures
varying between 400 and 1000°C were determined
from nitrogen adsorption isotherms conducted at
−196°C. These characteristics include speciﬁc
surface area (SBET), total pore volume (Vp) and
mean pore radius (r
¯). The adsorption isotherms,
not given belong to type II of the Brunauer
classiﬁcation [27]. The SBET values of different
adsorbents were computed from linear plots of

(and Al-IV) preheated at 400 and 500°C contain
narrow pores as dominant porosity and turned to
wide pores by heating at 600–1000°C. Inspection
of the results included in Table 2 revealed the
following: (i) the values of SBET and St are close
to each other for the different investigated adsor-
bents which justiﬁes the correct choice of standard
t-curves for pore analysis and indicates the ab-
sence of ultramicropores in these adsorbents; (ii)
the different surface characteristics of various in-
vestigated adsorbents were much affected by the
amount of Cr2O3 present and calcination temper-
ature. The observed decrease in the SBET of the
investigated adsorbents due to an increase in their
calcination temperature in the range of 400–
1000°C is normally expected and reﬂects the sin-
tering of these thermally treated adsorbents. The
sintering process takes place according to differ-

An additional set of speciﬁc surface areas St
was obtained from volume–thickness curves (V1−

AlCr-I, AlCr-II and AlCr-III mixed solid samples
preheated at 400–1000°C and different from
those of the other samples calcined at the same
temperatures. Fig. 2 shows the V1−t plots AlCr-I
calcined at 400–1000°C and Fig. 3 represents the

ent mechanisms depending on the temperatures of
the thermal treatment and the nature of the inves-
tigated adsorbents. More than one mechanism
may contribute in the sintering process [29–31].
The kinetics of the decrease in the speciﬁc
surface area and the particle size distribution de-
termined from X-ray diffraction proﬁles have
been successfully used to investigate the sintering
mechanisms [32–37]. This type of study had not
been followed up in the present work. The de-
crease in the speciﬁc surface area of solids due to
calcination at increasing temperatures may take
place according to particle adhesion with subse-
quent growth of the crystallite size, collapse or
shrinkage of pores and diffusion of ions of solids
along their outermost surface layers (surface dif-
fusion) ﬁlling the surface irregularities and cracks
between neighbouring crystallites [29,30]. It has
been reported that the rate constant of the sinter-
ing process as a function of temperature can be
satisfactorily represented as an exponential equa-
tion [35,36]. The effects of calcination temperature
of different tested solids on their crystallite sizes
have not been investigated.

The data of speciﬁc surface areas of different
adsorbents precalcined at various temperatures
enabled the activation energy of sintering (DEs) to
be determined by applying the relation [37,38]:
SBET=A exp
−DEs
RT
where A is a constant. When log SBET is plotted
versus 1/T a straight line is obtained whose slope
determines the values of DEs.
Fig. 4 shows log SBET versus 1/T for different
investigated adsorbents. The computed DEs values
were found to be 21, 7.6, 7.6, 15.3 and 33 kJ
mol−1 for AlCr-I, AlCr-II, AlCr-III, AlCr-IV and
AlCr-V adsorbents, respectively. These results
clearly indicate that sintering of Cr2O3/Al2O3
mixed solids is greatly affected by the amount
chromium oxide present. The increase in the
amount of Cr2O3 up to 15.7 wt.% brought about
an abrupt decrease in the DEs value which in-
creased progressively by increasing Cr2O3 content
above this limit. In other words, Cr2O3 facilitates
the sintering process of the investigated adsor-
bents when its amount attains 15.7 wt.% and
hinders their sintering by increasing its amount
above this limit.
3.4. Catalytic oxidation of CO by O2 o6er
different Cr2O3/Al2O3 solids calcined at 6arious
temperatures
The catalytic oxidation of CO by O2 over dif-
ferent Cr2O3/Al2O3 solids precalcined at 400–
1000°C was conducted at 250–400°C. The results
showed that the catalysis of CO oxidation by O2
follows ﬁrst-order kinetics over various investi-
gated catalysts.
3.4.1. Effect of Cr2O3 content on the catalytic
acti6ity of Cr2O3/Al2O3 system
Fig. 5 shows representative kinetic curves and
ﬁrst-order plots of the catalystic reaction con-
ducted over AlCr-V catalyst samples precalcined
at 600°C. The slope of the ﬁrst-order plots deter-
mines the magnitude of the reaction rate constant
(k) of the catalysed reaction carried out at a given
temperature. The k values of the catalysed reac-
tion conducted over different catalysts precalcined
at various temperatures were determined. The
change of k as a function of Cr2O3 content in the
catalyst samples calcined at 400, 600, 800 and
1000°C is graphically represented in Fig. 6. It is
seen from this ﬁgure that the catalystic activity,
expressed as reaction rate constant of various
investigated catalysts calcined at 400–1000°C in-
creases as a function of Cr2O3 content indicating
that Cr2O3 acts as catalysticly-active constituents.
However, the increase in the catalystic activity
due to the presence of increasing amounts of
chromium oxide could also be attributed to a
possible increase in the speciﬁc surface area of the
treated catalysts. In order to account for the
change in BET-surface area due to Cr2O3-treat-
ment, the reaction rate constant per unit surface
area (k
( ) was calculated for different catalysts and
the results obtained are graphically represented in
Fig. 7. It is clearly shown from Fig. 7 that k

3.4.2. Effect of precalcination temperature on the
catalytic acti6ity of Cr2O3/Al2O3 solids
The effect of calcination temperature on the
catalystic activity of different Cr2O3/Al2O3 solids
is better investigated by considering the change in
the values of k

temperature, as a function of precalcination tem-
perature of these solids.

tigated catalysts, expect AlCr-I catalyst sample.

increases progressively by increasing the amount
of chromium oxide in the catalysts precalcined

catalyst samples calcined at 600°C k
( increases as a
function of Cr2O3 content to reach a maximum
value at 8.2 wt.% then remains almost constant at
extents of loading above this limit. It can thus be
concluded that the observed increase in the cata-
lytic activity due to Cr2O3-treatment of various
catalysts could be attributed to an induced in-
crease in the concentration of the catalytically-
active constituents. This conclusion ﬁnds an ex-
perimental evidence from preliminary experiments
on Al2O3 support material precalcined at 400–
1000°C, these solid samples showed no measur-
able catalystic activity towards CO oxidation by
O2 even at 400°C.

solids. In fact, the departure of OH groups
strongly bound to the catalyst’s surface takes
place by heating at \400°C (c.f. Fig. 1) or by
exposure of these solids to suitable dose of g-rays
[26]. The complete removal of OH groups from
the Al2O3 lattice requires a heating at 600°C
[25]. The surface hydroxyl groups, which do not
contribute directly in chemisorption and catalysis
of CO oxidation reaction occupy a portion of the
catalyst’s surface thus blocking some active sites.
The removal of these OH groups liberate some
active sites for chemisorption and catalysis of CO
oxidation by O2. The descending part of the
curves in Fig. 8 (taking place at temperatures
]700°C) might result from a possible inward
migration of chromium species into the interior of
the treated solids decreasing thus their concentra-

temperature from 400 to 600°C then increases by
increasing the precalcination temperature above
this limit (c.f. Fig. 8). The descending part of
curves in Fig. 8 (400–600°C) could be attributed
to transformation of Cr2O5, CrO2 phases, present
in different investigated solids preheated at 400°C
into Cr2O3 phase upon heating at 600°C (c.f.
Table 1). This explanation suggests that the high
valence chromium oxides (penta and tetravalent)
exhibit higher catalystic activity than that of
lower valence chromium oxides (trivalent). The
observed increase in the catalystic activity of the
investigated solids upon increasing their precalci-
nation temperature \600°C could be attributed
to removal of most of strongly bound hydroxyl
groups from the top surface layers of the treated

tion on the top surface layers of these solids. The
inward migration of cobalt and nickel species
towards the interior of Co3O4/Al2O3 and NiO/
Al2O3 systems by heating at \500°C has been
reported using XPS investigation [41,42] which
permitted an accurate determination of surface
cobalt and nickel species in Co3O4/Al2O3 and
NiO/Al2O3 solids subjected to thermal treatment
at different temperatures. The observed decrease
in the catalystic activity of different investigated
Cr2O3/Al2O3 solids by heating at \700°C might
also be attributed to an effective metal oxide-sup-
port interaction leading to the formation of
chromium aluminium compound devoted with
smaller catalystic activity than that of chromium
oxide itself [39,40]. This speculation has not been
conﬁrmed by XRD investigation (c.f. Table 1).
So, one might think about the possible conver-
sion of some of Cr2O3 to lower valence chro-
mium oxide (Cr3O4) which might account for
the detected decrease in the catalytic activity
of the investigated solids due to calcination at
\700°C.

the Arrhenius equation. The computed values of
DE for the various catalysts investigated are listed
in Table 3. Also included in Table 3 are the values
log A (frequency factor in the Arrhenius equation)
calculated for different investigated solids. Inspec-
tion of the results given in Table 3 revealed a
number of points. (i) The rise in precalcination
temperature of AlCr-I and AlCr-II catalyst sam-
ples in the range 400–1000°C resulted in small
changes in the values of DE. These changes, how-
ever, were within the experimental error (94 kJ
mol−1) (ii) The values of DE for the catalytic
reaction conducted over these solids, except the
AlCr-I calcined at 800°C are of the same order of
magnitude (6294 kJ mol−1). (iii) The values of
DE for the reaction carried out over AlCr-V spec-

imens are smaller than those calculated for the
other solids investigated. (iv) The changes in the
values, of DE for the catalysed reaction conducted
over various catalysts calcined at different temper-
atures are accompanied by parallel changes in the
values of frequency factor (A). Hence, the ob-
served change in DE value due to increasing the
precalcination temperature of Cr2O3/Al2O3 solids
may result from the change in the magnitude of
the frequency factor. In fact, the activation energy
of the catalytic reaction over different solids cal-
cined at various temperatures was recalculated
with the values of A for AlCr-I, AlCr-II, AlCr-III,
AlCr-IV and AlCr-V precalcined at 400°C being
adopted for these solids calcined at 600, 800 and
1000°C. In other words, log A values of 2.38,
2.83, 1.02, 1.38 and 0.05 were found for AlCr-I
AlCr-V, respectively for these solids being cal-
cined at 600, 800 and 1000°C. The recalculated
values of the activation energy DE* for the vari-
ous solids investigated are listed in the last
column of Table 3. The comparison of DE* for
different solids calcined at various temperatures
revealed that the rise in precalcination tempera-
ture of all solids investigated did not much modify
the activation energy of CO oxidation by O2 over
different solids: DE values of 6091, 6291, 399
1, 4091 and 25 kJ mol–1 were found for AlCr-I,
AlCr-II, AlCr-III, AlCr-IV and AlCr-V, respec-
tively. These results clearly indicate that the rise in
precalcination temperature of the solids investi-
gated, containing different amounts of Cr2O3,
from 400 to 1000°C did not modify the mecha-
nism of the catalysed reaction but changed the
concentration of catalystically-active constituents
(surface chromium oxide species) without chang-
ing their energetic nature.
4. Conclusions
The following are the main conclusions that
could be drawn from the results obtained:
1. The heating of different mixtures of CrO3/
Al(OH)3 at 400°C resulted in the formation of
poorly crystalline g-alumina, Cr2O5, CrO2 and
trace amount of the Cr2O3 phase. The rise in
precalcination temperatures from 600 to 900°C
led to complete conversion of chromium ox-
ides into a-Cr2O3 besides the formation of a
mixture of g-, k-, and u-Al2O3. The heating of
these solids at 1000°C brought about the
transformation of a small portion of aluminas
to a-Al2O3 (corundum) and a portion of a-
Cr2O3 into Cr3O4 phase.
2. The BET-surface area of various adsorbents
decreases by increasing the precalcination tem-
peratures in the range 400–1000°C. Cr2O3
(4.3–15.3 wt.%) enhances the sintering of the
Cr2O3/Al2O3 system where the activation en-
ergy of sintering DEs decreases by this treat-
ment from 21 to 7.6 kJ mol−1. DEs was found
to increase to 33 kJ mol−1 in presence of 42.7
wt.% Cr2O3.
3. The catalytic activity of Cr2O3/Al2O3 increases
by increasing the amount of Cr2O3 present.
The curves relating the catalystic activity (re-
action rate constant per unit surface area)
showed a maximum at 700 or 800°C depend-
ing on the concentration of Cr2O3. The rise in
both Cr2O3 content and precalcination temper-
ature of Cr2O3/Al2O3 system did not modify
the mechanism of CO oxidation by O2 but
changed the concentration of catalytically ac-
tive
constituents
(surface
chromium
oxide
species).
