The initial activity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide cata-
lysts with and without Mg and Zr was studied in the dehydrogena-
tion of i-butane and n-butane at 580◦C under atmospheric pres-
sure. The catalyst activity was evaluated, after reduction with H2
and CO, as a function of the amount of the promotor. The dehydro-
genation activity was highest after CO reduction, and the selectivity
toward i-butene increased and the formation of coke decreased with
the addition of Mg. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
electron spin resonance, temperature programmed reduction, and
Fourier transform infrared measurements, during CO reduction,
V3+ species and two kinds of V4+ species with different coordina-
tions (A and B) were formed on the catalyst surface. During H2
reduction V3+ and some V4+ (B) species were formed. Apparently
both V4+ and V3+ species were active in the dehydrogenation, and
tentatively, we conclude that the activity of V4+ (A) was higher than
that of V3+. For the modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed catalysts, the oxida-
tion states after reduction, both with H2 and with CO, were similar
and were not the main reason for the differences in activities. It
is likely that the differences in activities induced by the promotors
were due to the acidities of the catalysts, which had an inﬂuence
on the side reactions of cracking, skeletal isomerization, and coke
formation. The oxidative dehydrogenation during the ﬁrst minutes
on butane stream with calcined catalysts was also affected by the
acidity of the catalyst.

INTRODUCTION
The dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the correspond-
ing alkenes is commercially carried out with supported
chromium oxide catalysts (1, 2) and platinum metal cata-
lysts (3, 4). Other, noncommercial alkane dehydrogenation
catalysts are based on Mo (5–10), V (11–15), Pd (16), Zn
(17, 18), Ni (19), and Ga (20). Supported vanadium oxide
catalysts have mainly been studied, however, for the oxida-
tive dehydrogenation of alkanes resulting in the formation

of alkenes and water (21–24). This reaction proceeds via the
Mars–van Krevelen mechanism and V5+ species have been
proposed as the active sites (25–27). Alkane molecules re-
act with oxygen atoms and the reduced vanadium cations
that are formed are reoxidized in the oxidative atmosphere.
In earlier work (11), we showed that supported vanadium
oxide catalyst is also active in the dehydrogenation of alka-
nes in the absence of oxygen, and the main products are
then alkenes and hydrogen. The catalytic performance of
VOx/Al2O3 was investigated after pretreatment with H2,
CH4, and CO, and the highest activity was obtained after
CO reduction. Reduced V4+ or V3+ centers, or both, were
proposed as the active dehydrogenation sites.
The goal of this work was to study the inﬂuence of pro-
motors Mg and Zr on the catalytic performance of sup-
ported vanadium oxide. Promotors, and in particular alkali
metal ions, are known to inﬂuence the redox and acid–base
properties of vanadium oxide catalysts (21, 28, 29). This
means that the addition of Mg or Zr to a VOx/Al2O3 cata-
lyst may have an effect on the catalytic performance in
alkane dehydrogenation reactions in the absence of oxy-
gen. The activity of supported vanadium oxide, with and
without a promotor, was studied here as a function of re-
action time and the catalyst pretreatment. The oxidation
states of vanadium were studied by electron spin resonance
(ESR), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and their inﬂu-
ence on the catalyst activity and selectivity is discussed.
EXPERIMENTAL
1. Catalyst Preparation
Supported vanadium oxide catalysts were prepared by
the incipient wetness impregnation method with alumina
as the support. Before impregnation, the alumina sup-
port (Akzo Nobel 000-1.5E) was crushed and sieved to
a particle size of 0.3–0.5 mm and calcined at 750◦C for
16 h with 5% oxygen in nitrogen (Aga; O2, 99.998%; N2,

99.999%). The impregnation was accomplished by dissolv-
ing NH4VO3 (Merck, >99%) in an aqueous solution of
oxalic acid (Riedel-de Ha¨
en AG, >99.5%). After impreg-
nation the catalyst was dried at 120◦C for 8 h and cal-
cined at 700◦C for 2 h with 5% O2 in N2. When promotor
(Mg or Zr) was used it was impregnated before the vana-
dium by applying an aqueous solution of magnesium nitrate
Mg(NO3)2 · 6H2O (Merck, >99%) or ZrO(NO3)2 · 7H2O
(Aldrich, reagent grade). The drying and calcination steps
were carried out in the same way as for vanadium impreg-
nation.
2. Activity Measurements
The activity measurements were carried out at 580◦C
under atmospheric pressure in a ﬁxed-bed microreactor.
The catalyst (load of 0.2 g) was heated to the reaction
temperature under 5% oxygen ﬂow (Aga; O2, 99.5%, N2,
99.999%). The n-butane (Aga, 99.95%) or i-butane feed
(Aga, 99.95%) with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV)
of 5 h−1 was diluted with nitrogen (Aga, 99.999%), the mo-
lar ratio of nitrogen to butane being 9 : 1. The nitrogen was
puriﬁed with an Oxisorb (Messer Griesheim). The activity
of the catalyst was followed for 15 min, after which the cata-
lyst was ﬂushed with nitrogen and regenerated with diluted
air. Several cycles were performed with the same catalyst.
Some of the catalysts were reduced with 5% H2 (Aga,
99.999%) or 5% CO (Messer Griesheim GmbH, 99.997%)
in N2 for 30 min at 585◦C before the activity measure-
ments.
The products were analyzed on-line with a Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) gas analyzer (Gasmet, Temet
Instruments Ltd.). The FTIR spectra were measured in
the wavenumber range 850–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of
8 cm−1 at a scanning rate of 10 scans/s. The cuvette (9 cm3)
was maintained at constant temperature (175◦C) and pres-
sure (103 kPa). The method of analyzing the reaction prod-
ucts by FTIR gas analysis has been discussed in detail else-
where (30). During the ﬁrst minute on stream, the spectra
were measured every 3 s; then they were measured every
7 s, and after a few minutes every 30 s.
The hydrocarbons formed during the dehydrogenation
were also analyzed on-line with a gas chromatograph (GC)
HP 6890 after 10 min on stream. A capillary column
(HP-Plot/Al2O3 “M” deactivated) and a ﬂame ionization
detector were used to separate and detect the hydrocar-
bons. After the GC sampling, the analysis with the FTIR
gas analyzer was continued. The lines to the FTIR gas ana-
lyzer and the GC were heated to 175◦C. The conversion and
selectivities were calculatedfromthereactorproduct onthe
basis of the carbon balance. The calculation is presented in
detail elsewhere (5). The coke formed on the catalyst dur-
ing the dehydrogenation was not taken into account in the
carbon balance.
3. Catalyst Characterization
After dissolution of the solids, the amounts of V and Mg
were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)
and the amount of Zr was measured by inductively coupled
plasma (ICP). The surface area of the catalyst was deter-
mined with a Coulter Omnisorp 100CX (static volumetric
method). The crystalline structure was studied by X-ray
diffraction (XRD) analysis with a Siemens D500 instru-
ment using CuKα radiation. The reduction of the catalysts
was studied by TPR. The measurements were performed
with an Altamira Instruments AMI-100 catalyst charac-
terization system. Catalyst samples (50 mg) were dried at
130◦C for 60 min with helium, calcined with 5% O2/He
at 600◦C for 30 min, and cooled down to 30◦C in air. The
samples were then heated from 30◦C to 580 or 750◦C at
a rate of 5◦C/min under 10% H2 in argon (30 cm3/min)
and kept at the ﬁnal temperature for 30 min. The consump-
tion of hydrogen was measured with a thermal conductivity
detector.
Some of the catalysts were investigated with XPS. For this
purpose, the catalysts were heated to 580–585◦C under 5%
oxygen ﬂow in the ﬁxed-bed microreactor and some of the
catalysts were then reduced with 5% H2 or 5% CO in N2
for 30 min. After this, the catalysts were inertly transferred
to a glove box and prepared for analysis under nitrogen
atmosphere. Finally, they were transferred to the XPS in-
strument under vacuum. The XPS measurements were per-
formed in an X-probe Model 101 spectrometer (Surface
Science Instruments, VG Fisons) using a monochromatized
AlKα X-ray source. A nickel grid and a ﬂood gun were used
to compensate for sample charging. The background pres-
sure during the XPS acquisition was better than 1×10−6 Pa
(1 × 10−8 Torr). High-resolution spectra of the V 2p, Mg
2s, Zr 3d, Al 2p, O 1s, and C 1s regions with a resolution
of 0.9 eV and a low-resolution survey spectrum were mea-
sured using a nominal spot size of 600 µm. Atomic sensitiv-
ity factors provided by the instrument manufacturer were
used to calculate the relative surface concentrations. The Al
2p line (74.5 eV) was used as a binding energy reference.
The overlapping signals were deconvoluted using symmet-
rical Gaussian–Lorenzian (80/20) lines with the following
constraints for all oxidation states: nonlinear Shirley back-
ground subtraction, an intensity ratio of V2p3/2 to V2p1/2
of 2.19; and a doublet separation (V2p1/2–V2p3/2) of 7.3–
7.6 eV. The oxidation state and coordination environment
of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts after different
treatments were also measured by ESR. The ESR spectra
were taken with a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer equipped
with a double rectangular TE104 mode cavity in X band
at −153 and 27◦C. Selected ESR spectra were simulated
with the SIMPOW program, which generates a powder
spectrum calculated to second order. A linear background
subtraction was applied for each ESR spectrum by using

formedbydoubleintegrationofthespectraandcomparison
with a Cu(acac)2/KCl reference sample with known spin
density.
RESULTS
1. Characterization of Fresh Catalysts
The vanadium and promotor contents of the supported
vanadium oxide catalysts are presented in Table 1. For
all the catalysts the vanadium content was between 4 and
6 wt%, while the amounts of Mg and Zr varied. The sam-
ple designations given in Table 1 indicate the measured
amounts of vanadium and promotor in the catalyst. The
XRD pattern of the V5 catalyst showed reﬂections typi-
cal for the alumina support. Since the pattern of crys-
tallinevanadiumoxidewasnotdetected,weassumethatthe
vanadium oxide was well dispersed in the catalyst. The
XRD patterns of the catalysts V5Mg2 and V5Mg5 only
showed reﬂections for the alumina support, but the pres-
ence of mixed Mg–Al–O was indicated by the shift of the
reﬂections from γ -alumina toward smaller 2θ angles, i.e.,
larger d spacing and by the change in the intensity ratios. In
addition, the catalyst V5Mg9 also showed some reﬂections
at 43◦2θ and 62◦2θ, indicating the presence of MgO crystal-
lites. The XRD diffractograms do not exclude the possibil-
ity of Mg vanadates, however, since their crystal size could
be below the detection limit of the method (31–33). The
zirconium-modiﬁed catalysts contained two crystal forms
of ZrO2: monoclinic and tetragonal. The content of crys-
tallineZrO2 inV6Zr12washigherthanthatinV5Zr5.Some
small diffraction peaks indicated the presence of a minor
amount of ZrV2O7 as well. This is in line with Khodakov
et al. (34), who observed the conversion of ZrO2 to the
monoclinic phase and the formation of ZrV2O7 after they

calcined the VOx/ZrO2 catalyst at temperatures above
600◦C. The reﬂections from the support were not shifted
like for the Mg-modiﬁed catalysts. The crystalline size, as
calculated from the half-width of the diffraction peak from
γ -alumina (4,4,0) using the Scherrer equation was 58 ± 2
˚
A for all the catalysts. Finally, the BET surface areas of the
catalysts are comparable with the BET surface area of the
alumina support treated under identical conditions. This
supports the conclusion that the species impregnated on
alumina were well dispersed.
2. Catalytic Activity Measurements
The thermal reactions of butanes were studied in the ab-
sence of catalyst by replacing the catalyst material with car-
borundum of equal volume. Under the conditions used for
the activity tests, the conversions of i-butane and n-butane
were below 2%. The activity of the unmodiﬁed V5 catalyst
was studied with i-butane feed at 580◦C. Activities were
studied after calcination of the catalyst and after reduc-
tion at 580◦C for 30 min with H2 or CO. The conversion
of i-butane and the selectivity to i-butene after these pre-
treatments are presented in Fig. 1. The product composition
wasmeasuredon-linewiththeFTIRgasanalyzerduringthe
ﬁrst 7 min on stream, with the on-line gas chromatograph
after 10 min on stream, and then again with the FTIR gas
analyzer. The conversions and selectivities after 1 min on
stream and the amounts of coke formed during the dehy-
drogenation test of 15 min are summarized in Table 2. As
can be seen, the conversion of i-butane was highest after
CO reduction. However, the activity declined rapidly. The
conversion was lowest for the calcined vanadium oxide cat-
alyst, but it increased slightly during the ﬁrst minutes on
stream. The selectivity to i-butene was the highest after CO
reduction and the lowest after H2 reduction. The activity
pattern of the unmodiﬁed catalyst used as reference mate-
rial has been presented in detail elsewhere (11). At 580◦C

the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion of i-butane to
i-butene and H2 is 89%.
2.1. Dehydrogenation activity of Mg-modiﬁed VOx cata-
lysts.
The conversions of i-butane and the selectivities to
i-butene for Mg-modiﬁed catalyst V5Mg5 are shown in
Fig. 2. The conversion of i-butane was higher after CO re-
duction than after calcining and H2 reduction. The same
result was obtained for the supported vanadium oxide cata-
lysts in the absence of promotor, as noted above. The con-
version was lower, however, and the selectivity to i-butene
was higher than that for the catalysts without modiﬁcation.
Furthermore, the selectivities toward i-butene increased
and thei-butane conversion decreased with higher contents
of Mg. Table 2 indicates that the selectivities toward C1–C3
products, n-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene were lower with the
Mg-modiﬁed VOx catalyst than with the V5 catalyst. Nei-
ther H2 nor CO reduction increased the selectivity for the
formation of n-butenes and 1,3-butadiene. Finally, the
amountofcokeformationduringthedehydrogenationtests
with the calcined catalysts was lower for the Mg-modiﬁed
material.

2.2. Dehydrogenation activity of Zr-modiﬁed VOx cata-
lysts.
As shown in Fig. 3, the calcined and H2-reduced
Zr-modiﬁed VOx catalyst V5Zr5 showed slightly higher
activity and selectivity to i-butene than the catalyst with-
out modiﬁcation. However, after CO reduction the conver-
sion and selectivities obtained with catalysts V5 and V5Zr5
were very similar. The amount of coke formed during the

dehydrogenation test of 15 min was also similar for catalysts
V5 and V5Zr5, as summarized in Table 2.
2.3. Effect of water treatment on catalyst performance.
It
was observed in our previous study (11) that the adsorption
of water on the catalyst surface prior to the activity test no-
ticeably affects the catalyst activity. We now continue those
experiments. The calcined catalyst V5 was treated with a
feed containing nitrogen and 3% water for 3 min, and after
calcination and water treatment the activity of the cata-
lyst was measured in the dehydrogenation of i-butane. The
conversion of i-butane and the selectivities were identical
to those presented in Fig. 1. Apparently the water treat-
ment has no effect on the activity of the calcined catalyst,
which mainly consists of V5+ species.
The same water pretreatment was performed after
H2 and CO reduction: the catalyst was reduced with H2
or CO for 30 min and then treated with 3% H2O in N2
stream for 3 min. After this, the activity of the catalyst was
measured in the dehydrogenation of i-butane. The conver-
sion of i-butane was stable at 30% for 15 min after both H2
and CO reduction. In the absence of water treatment, the
initial conversion of i-butane was 60% after CO reduction
and 40% after H2 reduction (see Fig. 1). Thus, H2O appears
to deactivate the catalytically active V3+/4+ species formed
duringtheprereductionstep.However,noCOx compounds
were formed during the i-butane test after water treatment.
A similar decrease in the activity was observed for the
Mg- and Zr-modiﬁed catalysts.
2.4. Dehydrogenation activity with n-butane feed.
The
results of the dehydrogenation tests performed with the
n-butane feed and V5 catalysts are presented in Fig. 4. The
conversions of n-butane and the selectivities of n-butenes
and 1,3-butadiene are presented for calcined, CO-reduced,
and H2-reduced catalysts. The conversion and selectivities
show trends similar to those of thei-butane test. The highest
activity was obtained after reduction with CO, the conver-
sion of n-butane being 45% after 1 min on n-butane stream.
The decrease in the conversion of n-butane was faster, how-
ever, and the coke formation was slightly higher than that
during the i-butane feed (Table 3). The total selectivity to
unsaturated C4 products was similar with the n-butane and
i-butanefeeds.However,theselectivityfortheformationof
i-butene with the n-butane feed was clearly lower than the
selectivity for the formation of n-butenes and 1,3-butadiene
with the i-butane feed. The results obtained with catalysts
V5Mg5 and V5Zr5 after 1 min on stream are shown in
Table 3. The selectivities for the formation of lighter and
heavier hydrocarbons were higher with the n-butane feed
than with the i-butane feed.
In addition to the activity, the acid–base character of the
catalyst can inﬂuence the distribution of n-butenes in the
product (21). The distributions of 1-butene, cis-2-butene,
trans-2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene, expressed relative to
the amount of cis-2-butene, were 0.6/1.0/1.2/2.3 for V5,

butadiene was high during the ﬁrst minute on stream with
all three catalysts and highest with the Mg-modiﬁed cata-
lyst. In all cases, however, it rapidly decreased near the ra-
tio 1/1. After H2 and CO reductions of the catalysts, the
distribution was stable and close to 1/1/1/1 during the test
of 15 min, similar to the situation prevailing after several

Under the test conditions at thermodynamic equilibrium
the conversion of n-butane to 1-butene, cis-2-butene, trans-

3. Reduction Experiments and Catalyst Characterization
During the reductions with H2 or CO, prior to the activ-
ity tests, the amounts of evolved water and CO2 were mea-
sured with an on-line FTIR gas analyzer. The reduction is
presented in Table 4 as the molar ratio of the amount of
released oxygen to the amount of vanadium (O/V). After
taking into account the Boudouard reaction during CO re-
duction and the estimate of the water retainment during H2
reduction (11), we calculated the average oxidation states
for vanadium after H2 and CO reduction as between 3.4
and 4.

FIG. 5.
TPR proﬁles of the V5, V5Mg2, and V5Zr5 catalysts.
The TPR measurements (presented in Fig. 5) show that
the V5 and V5Zr5 catalysts were reduced at the same
temperature, while the Mg-modiﬁed catalyst V5Mg2 was
reduced at a temperature 20◦C higher. The consumption
of hydrogen (Table 5) was similar for the three catalysts.
Assuming a reduction stoichiometry of 0.5 H2/V from V5+
to V4+ and an average oxidation state of 5 for the calcined
catalyst, the average oxidation state of vanadium in catalyst
V5 would be 3.5 after reduction to 580◦C.
The vanadium species present after H2 and CO reduction
were studied in more detail by XPS and ESR methods. The
deconvolution of the XPS spectra of the V 2p region indi-
cated the presence of three doublets, i.e., three oxidation
states of vanadium. The line for V 2p3/2 was between 517.4
and 517.7 eV for V5+, between 516.4 and 516.7 eV for V4+,
and between 515.8 and 516.1 eV for V3+. A typical result
of the peak-ﬁtting procedure for V5 was presented earlier
(11). The amount of each oxidation state was obtained af-
ter deconvolution of the spectra, and the average oxida-
tion states of vanadium in the different catalysts are pre-
sented in Table 6. In the calcined V5 catalyst the vanadium

Zr-modiﬁed catalysts also contained small amounts of ox-
idation states 4+ and 3+. Species V5+, V4+, and V3+ were
observed after the H2 and CO reductions. The line for Mg
2s was between 89.1 and 89.3 eV. The XPS results showed
a molar ratio Mg/V of 1.0 for the calcined V5Mg2 catalyst.
The line for Zr 3p5/2 was between 182.0 and 182.2 eV, and a
molar ratio Zr/V of 0.5 was obtained for the calcined V5Zr5
catalyst.
Figure 6 shows the ESR spectra of the sample V5 after
different treatments. All the spectra are typical for V4+,
with a d1 conﬁguration and a nuclear spin I of 7
2, resulting
in a complex spectrum with a large number of hyperﬁne
lines. Detailed analysis of the spectra of the catalysts V5,
V5Mg5, and V5Zr5 by spectrum simulation and quantita-
tive determination of the spin concentration of V4+ reveals

the following:
1. Two distinct magnetically isolated V4+ species were
present, labeled as species A and B. The ESR parameters
of the species were as follows: species A is characterized
by gxx = gyy = 1.984, gzz = 1.946, Axx = Ayy = 60 G, and
Azz = 172 G, while speciesBischaracterizedby gxx = gyy =
1.982, gzz = 1.939, Axx = Ayy = 75 G, and Azz = 193 G.
These values are in agreement with those recently reported
by Catana et al. (35).
2. Species A, which is the dominant species after calci-
nation, was almost absent after reduction with hydrogen
at 580◦C, but a signiﬁcant amount of species A was always
present with CO as the reducing agent, even after reduction
at 580◦C.
3. The ESR spectrum was always broader and less re-
solved when CO was used as the reducing agent. This
indicates that the paramagnetic species at the surface are
close to each other, giving rise to spin–spin interactions.
4. The amounts of V4+ in the calcined and H2- and
CO-reduced catalysts were very similar for the three cata-
lysts under study (Table 7), although the amounts varied

signiﬁcantly after the different pretreatments. Looking at
the three catalysts together, the content of V4+ relative to
the total V content was between 7 and 12% for the calcined
catalyst, 5 and 14% for the H2-reduced catalyst, and 31
and 35% for the CO-reduced catalyst. Thus, reduction with
carbon monoxide leads to the highest concentrations of V4+
at the catalyst surface.
In another experiment we subjected the V5Mg5 cata-
lyst to carbon monoxide reduction at different tempera-
tures. The ESR spectra recorded after these treatments are
shown in Fig. 7. The spectra indicate that the reduction
with CO begins above 200◦C and a new V4+ species B is
generated at the catalyst surface. The amounts of V4+ and
of species A and B in the V5Mg5 catalyst were obtained
by spectrum simulation and double integration of the cor-
responding ESR spectra and the result of this quantitative
analysis is given in Table 8. The results show that (1) after
the reduction with carbon monoxide at 580◦C the amount
of V4+ is about 35% of the total V content (2), the amounts
of species A and B increase with the reduction temperature,
and (3) the amount of species A is always greater than the
amount of species B at the catalyst surface, even at the
highest reduction temperature. As was noted above, this
last observation was not made for the samples reduced in
hydrogen.
Finally, the V5Mg5 catalyst, ﬁrst calcined and then
treated in CO at 580◦C, was subjected to a saturated N2
stream of water at 580◦C for 30 min. The ESR spectrum
showed the presence of the two V4+ species A and B in
almost the same ratio as after CO reduction. The only dif-
ference was a slight increase (3–5%) in the amount of V4+
in the catalyst material. This indicates that the same V4+
species are present in the catalyst before and after the wa-
ter treatment.
DISCUSSION
1. Reduction of Catalysts
According to the XPS measurement the calcined vana-
dium oxide catalysts contained vanadium mostly in oxida-
tion state 5+. This is in line with the ESR measurement,
250

which indicated only small amounts of V4+, and with the
observations of Wachs and Weckhuysen (36). The XRD
indicated the incorporation of some Mg to the alumina ma-
trix. Though the current XRD or ESR data did not indicate
the incorporation of V into the matrix or the formation of
magnesium vanadates, these processes can, however, occur
as reported previously in the literature (31–33, 37).
The techniques we used in this study showed that the av-
erage oxidation states of the catalysts after CO and after H2
reduction were similar. According to the TPR results, the
Mg-modiﬁed catalyst reduces at a slightly higher temper-
ature than the unmodiﬁed and the Zr-modiﬁed catalysts,
indicating a more difﬁcult reduction of the VOx species.
Still, after the reduction for 30 min at 580◦C the average
oxidation states of the three catalysts were fairly similar.
The extent of the reduction of the vanadium species may
decrease with increasing Mg content as shown by the higher
average oxidation state obtained for catalyst V5Mg5 than
for V5 (Table 4).
The ESR results were clearly different for the two re-
ducing agents. The total amount of V4+ was highest after
CO reduction, and two species of V4+ (A and B) were ob-
served. The total amount of V4+ was quite small after H2
reduction: evidently the vanadium was mainly reduced to
oxidation state 3+ (38) and only a small amount of V4+ (B)
was formed.
There were some discrepancies in the ESR and XPS re-
sults. The most signiﬁcant discrepancies were between the
amounts of V4+ calculated from the deconvoluted XPS
spectra and measured by ESR after H2 reduction of the
unmodiﬁed and Zr-modiﬁed catalysts. Still, the trends with
the two techniques were similar. The distribution of the
V4+ and V3+ species is known to be highly dependent on
the conditions of reduction (36). Some of the differences
may also be accounted for by the speciﬁc features of the
two techniques, for example, by background subtractions
used for XPS and ESR.
From the TPR, XPS, FTIR, and ESR results together,
we can conclude that, after reduction with H2, the average
oxidation state of vanadium was about 3.5. The oxidation
states present were V5+, V4+ (B), and V3+. After CO reduc-
tion, the average oxidation state was slightly higher, about
3.9 owing to the greater amount of V4+ (A + B) and the
smaller amount of V3+. This indicates that vanadium oxide
was reduced to lower state with H2 than with CO. In this
calculation it was assumed that the calcined catalyst con-
tained only V5+ species. If, however, V4+ or V3+ species
exist on the calcined catalyst, as indicated by the ESR and
XPS measurements, the average oxidation state of the cat-
alysts would be lower after the reductions. This would not
inﬂuence the differences in the average oxidation states be-
tween the reducing agent used. It could, however, cause
some difference when the average oxidation states of vana-
dium are compared between the various catalysts.
2. Activity
High activity of the alumina-supported vanadium oxide
catalysts was obtained in the dehydrogenation of bu-
tanes to butenes and hydrogen. Activity was best with the
CO-reduced catalyst, either unmodiﬁed or modiﬁed with
Zr. The highest selectivity for the corresponding butene
was obtained with the Mg-modiﬁed catalyst, however.
The characterizations of the reduced catalyst by ESR and
XPS support the conclusion that the oxidation state V4+ or
V3+ is the active phase in the dehydrogenation reaction.
It is clear that the active phase was formed during the CO
reduction. The vanadium species then present were V4+
(A and B) and V3+. The activity may be reduced by 50%
by adsorption of water on these sites. However, the ESR
measurement showed that the water treatment did not af-
fect the coordination of the V4+ sites. Moreover, no COx
was released in the subsequent butane test. The activity
of the catalysts was also high on the H2-reduced surfaces,
which contained mainly V3+ and V4+ (species B). Compar-
ison of the results thus clearly shows that both V3+ and V4+
(A and/or B) are active in some degree. The activity of V4+
(A) is probably higher than that of V3+.
The ESR and XPS studies also revealed that the oxida-
tion state of the catalyst after reduction with H2 or CO at
580◦C was not different when the catalyst was modiﬁed with
Mg and Zr. This means that the differences in the activities
of the modiﬁed catalysts were not due to the different oxi-
dation states of vanadium. Instead, they may have been due
to changes in the hydrocarbon–catalyst interaction, which
is proposed to be weaker on a catalyst of basic character
(39, 40). A strong hydrocarbon–catalyst interaction is ex-
pected on an acid catalyst and this could lead to cracking
and coke formation (highly dehydrogenated products), as
observed in this study with the unmodiﬁed and Zr-modiﬁed
vanadium oxide catalyst.
It can be assumed that the formation of n-butenes and
1,3-butadiene from the i-butane feed and of i-butene from
the n-butane feed are due to consecutive dehydrogenation
and isomerization reactions. The formation of isomerized
products (skeletal isomerization) indicates higher acidity
of the catalyst (41) and a bifunctional mechanism. With
the V5 catalyst, the selectivity for isomerization increased
markedly after reduction with H2 or CO. Similar results
were obtained with the Zr-modiﬁed catalyst. In the case of
the Mg-modiﬁed catalyst the amount of isomerization was
lower both after calcination and after H2 and CO reduc-
tions, indicating a lower acidity.

catalysts were lower than those measured for the calcined

the active phase on the alumina support. The higher acidity

of the reduced catalysts might then be due to the alumina
support. The V/Al ratio was not decreased in the reduced
Mg-modiﬁed catalyst, so in this case the dispersion of VOx
may not have been changed by the reduction and, therefore,
the selectivity for skeletal isomerization remained lower.
The better dispersion may have been due to the presence
of Mg species.
The main side reaction with the i-butane feed was the for-
mation of n-butenes and 1,3-butadiene, that is, the skeletal
isomerization of the formed i-butene (and subsequent de-
hydrogenation of n-butenes). With the n-butane feed, the
selectivity for isomerization was lower. This is in accor-
dance with the thermodynamics of skeletal isomerization
at 580◦C. Instead, the main side reactions with the n-butane
feed were cracking and the formation of heavier com-
pounds. Modiﬁcation of the catalyst with Mg reduced the
selectivity for side reactions.
Butenes can also be formed by oxidative dehydrogena-
tion reaction of butanes to butenes and water without the
presence of any gaseous oxygen (11, 43–46). This reac-
tion was likely proceeding under our conditions with the
calcined catalysts. We believe that the high proportion of
1,3-butadiene obtained during the ﬁrst minute on stream
in the reaction between n-butane and the calcined catalyst
was due to oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (47, 48).
This would mean that the different acidities of the cata-
lysts had an inﬂuence on the distribution of n-butenes and
1,3-butadiene as the products of oxidative dehydrogenation
as the acidity inﬂuenced the selectivity for skeletal isomer-
ization. For all three catalysts, however, the distribution
of n-butenes and 1,3-butadiene remained very similar af-
ter reduction with n-butane, CO, and H2, showing that the
inﬂuence of the acidity on the distribution of the dehydro-
genation products was small. The conversion of n-butane to
n-butenes was not in thermodynamic equilibrium with the
VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. Despite this, the distribution of the
n-butenes and their reaction to 1,3-butadiene was close to
the calculated equilibrium value. As well, the dehydrogena-
tion of i-butane to i-butene was not at equilibrium. The
yields of butenes with VOx catalysts were noticeably better
than those obtained with MoOx catalyst, though they were
not yet at the level obtainable with CrOx catalysts (49).
CONCLUSIONS
Characterization of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by XPS, ESR,
TPR, and FTIR showed that V5+ species were reduced to
V4+ and V3+ during reduction with H2 and CO. The average
oxidation state of vanadium obtained with H2 was slightly
lower than obtained with CO. Vanadium was mainly re-
duced to V3+ with H2, and only a small amount of V4+
(B) was measured by ESR. A larger amount of V4+ (co-
ordinations A and B) and some V3+ were formed during
CO reduction. The highest activity in dehydrogenation of
butanes to butenes and H2 was obtained after reduction of
the catalysts with CO. It is likely that both V4+ and V3+ were
active species in the dehydrogenation, and, tentatively, we
conclude that the activity of V4+ (A) was higher than that
of V3+.
Modiﬁcation of the catalyst with Mg caused a decrease
in the activity of the catalyst while increasing the selectivity
for dehydrogenation. Zr modiﬁcation caused little change
in the activity. The average oxidation state of vanadium
and the distribution of oxidation states V5+, V4+, and V3+
observed for the three catalysts were similar after reduc-
tion of the catalyst with H2 or CO at 580◦C. The oxidation
stateofvanadiumwasnot,therefore,responsibleforthedif-
ferences in activities. Selectivities for the side reactions of
cracking, skeletal isomerization, and coke formation were
noticeably different for the V5Zr5 and V5Mg5 catalysts,
and the differences were attributed to the acidities of the
catalysts.
