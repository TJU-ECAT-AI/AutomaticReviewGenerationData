Abstract
Vanadia species on aluminas (δ- and γ-Al2O3) with surface VOx density in the range 0.01−14.2 V/nm2 have been characterized by UV and visible Raman spectroscopy, UV−visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV−Vis DRS), and temperature-programmed reduction in hydrogen. It is shown that the alumina phase has little influence on the structure and reducibility of surface VOx species under either dehydrated or hydrated conditions. Three similar types of dispersed VOx species, i.e., monovanadates, polyvanadates, and V2O5, are identified on both aluminas under dehydrated conditions. Upon hydration, polymerized VOx species dominate on the surfaces of the two aluminas. The broad Raman band at around 910 cm-1, observed on dehydrated V/δ-, γ-Al2O3 at all V loadings (0.01−14.2 V/nm2), is assigned to the interface mode (VOAl) instead of the conventionally assigned VOV bond. The direct observation of the interface bond is of significance for the understanding of redox catalysis because this bond has been considered to be the key site in oxidation reactions catalyzed by supported vanadia. Two types of frequency shifts of the VO stretching band (1013−1035 cm-1) have been observed in the Raman spectra of V/Al2O3:  a shift as a function of surface VOx density and a shift as a function of excitation wavelength. The shift of the VO band to higher wavenumbers with increasing surface VOx density is due to the change of VOx structure. The VO stretching band in dispersed vanadia always appears at lower wavenumber in UV Raman spectra than in visible Raman spectra for the same V/Al2O3 sample. This shift is explained by selective resonance enhancement according to the UV−Vis DRS results. It implies that UV Raman has higher sensitivity to isolated and less polymerized VOx species while visible Raman is more sensitive to highly polymerized VOx species and crystalline V2O5. These results show that a multiwavelength excitation approach provides a more complete structural characterization of supported VOx catalysts.

1. Introduction
Supported vanadia catalysts have attracted significant interest in recent decades due to their good catalytic performance in many redox reactions 1-6 such as dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins, oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde, ammoxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons, and selective reduction of NOx. A better understanding of the catalytic properties of supported vanadium oxides requires determination of the structure−reactivity relationships of the supported VOx catalysts. Raman spectroscopy has been successfully and frequently employed by many research groups for characterization of the molecular structure of supported vanadium oxides.2,4-18 For vanadia supported on most oxide supports, e.g., SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO, etc., three types of surface vanadia species have been identified by Raman spectroscopy:  isolated vanadia, polymerized vanadia, and crystalline V2O5. The presence of these species is a function of VOx loading, the nature of the support, and the ambient environment.2,4-11,15 Three kinds of bonds between vanadium and oxygen are present in these VOx species:  VO, VOV, and VOS (S, support). It is generally accepted that the bridging VOS bond is critical for redox reactions catalyzed by supported VOx.4-6,13,18 The discrimination of different surface VOx species has generally been based on their characteristic Raman features. Isolated and polymerized VOx species have been characterized by sharp VO stretching bands in the range 900−1050 cm-1; broad Raman features in the range 500−950 cm-1 have been attributed to VOV stretching in polymerized VOx, and the presence of V2O5 is indicated by an intense VO stretching band at 995 cm-1. The catalytic properties of supported VOx catalysts have been shown to be sensitive to the distribution of these surface VOx species.4-6,10,13,15
It is notable that most Raman studies of supported VOx catalysts were carried out using a single excitation wavelength in the visible region (either 514 or 532 nm).3-15 However, several recent investigations on supported transition-metal oxides,16,17,19,20 including vanadium oxides16,17 under ambient conditions, using both UV and visible wavelength Raman excitations suggest that more complete and sometimes new structural information of supported metal oxides can be achieved by using multiple excitation wavelengths. The reason lies in the strong electronic absorptions in the UV and visible wavelength regions exhibited by most transition-metal oxides which make it possible to measure resonance-enhanced Raman spectra. Under circumstances where supported VOx species are present in a distribution of cluster sizes or coordination geometries, it is likely that these species also possess a corresponding distribution of electronic absorption wavelengths. Excitation of Raman spectra within the absorption region will produce resonance-enhanced spectra from the subset of VOx species with absorptions at the excitation wavelength. Through measurement of the Raman spectra at several wavelengths, more information can be obtained about the various VOx species in the distribution. Moreover, when UV excitation is employed, even Raman spectra from supported VOx at low loadings (<1wt %) on oxides having strong fluorescence are possible because of the avoidance of fluorescence and enhanced sensitivity. 21,22
The present work is aimed at a further study of the structure of VOx supported on alumina using both UV (244 nm) and visible (488 nm) excited Raman spectroscopy and especially the structure of supported VOx at extremely low surface density (down to 0.01 V/nm2). The V/Al2O3 samples were studied under both hydrated and dehydrated conditions. Interpretation of the Raman spectra was also aided by UV−visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV−Vis DRS) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements. Two different aluminas, δ- and γ-Al2O3, were selected as the supports in order to investigate the influence of different alumina phases (environments) on the structure of surface VOx species. It is our intention to use these supported VOx materials as catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, and with this in mind, the suitability of various alumina phases was considered. Since the dehydrogenation reaction operates near the temperature for phase transition from γ-Al2O3 to δ-Al2O3, 23,24 the δ-alumina phase is expected to be more stable for dehydrogenation reactions. Therefore, we were motivated to compare V/δ-Al2O3 to the more extensively studied V/γ-Al2O3 system.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Sample Preparation. All supported VOx samples were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation of aluminas with aqueous NH4VO3 (99+%, Aldrich) solutions. Oxalic acid (99%, Aldrich) (NH4VO3/oxalic acid = 0.5 molar) was added into the solutions for high VOx loadings to ensure the dissolution of NH4VO3. Two types of aluminas were used:  δ-Al2O3 (Johnson Matthey, UK, SBET = 101 m2/g) and γ-Al2O3 (Engelhard, SBET = 220 m2/g). The surface area (SBET) data were provided by the manufacturers. Because of differences in surface area of the aluminas, surface VOx density (V/nm2) instead of surface VOx loading (wt %) is used to describe the supported VOx samples. A V/Al2O3 sample with surface VOx density of Y V/nm2 will be denoted as YV in the following text. After impregnation, the samples were dried at room temperature by purging with air and then heated at 393 K overnight. Finally, the samples were calcined at higher temperature (823 K for V/δ-Al2O3 and 773 K for V/γ-Al2O3) for 6 h in air.
2.2. Raman Studies. Both UV (244 nm) and visible (488 nm) Raman spectra of V/Al2O3 samples were collected using the UV Raman instrument built at Northwestern University17,21,22 under dehydrated and hydrated conditions. The 244-nm line is from a Lexel 95 SHG (second harmonic generation) laser equipped with an intracavity nonlinear crystal, BBO (β-barium borate:  BaB2O4), that frequency doubled visible radiation into the mid-ultraviolet region. The 488-nm line is obtained by removing the BBO crystal and replacing the UV output coupler by a visible one in the Lexel 95 SHG laser. Because the grating settings in the spectrometer are optimized for Raman scattering near the 244-nm region, the spectral range for visible Raman (∼260 cm-1) study on the same spectrometer is much narrower than that of UV Raman (∼1500 cm-1). Consequently, the spectra obtained using 488-nm excitation are displayed in the range 820−1070 cm-1. This region contains the strongest and most informative Raman bands of supported VOx and provides the best comparison to UV Raman spectra.
Raman spectra of dehydrated samples were collected under a controlled atmosphere using a fluidized bed reactor designed in this lab. 25 The V/Al2O3 samples were heated in the fluidized bed reactor in flowing 5% O2/N2 (60 mL/min) at high temperatures (823 K for V/δ-Al2O3 and 773 K for V/γ-Al2O3) for 2 h to remove adsorbed moisture. Raman spectra were then taken at room temperature in flowing He (>100 mL/min). Hydrated samples were obtained by exposing the calcined samples to ambient conditions for at least 2 days, and spectra were measured from powder samples loaded in a cap spinning at ∼2000 rpm. The laser power at the sample position was ∼2 mW for 244-nm irradiation and ∼20 mW for 488-nm irradiation. Data collection times varied from 600 s to 6 h depending on the signal level. The Raman shift was calibrated by measuring several liquid standards including cyclohexane, acetonitrile, chloroform, ethyl acetate, toluene, and benzene. A mathematical procedure involving a quadratic fit of the observed to the actual wavenumbers of the standards was employed. The band positions in the Raman spectra were determined using the program PeakFit v4.11.
Interference from laser-induced changes of the V/Al2O3 samples under 488- and 244-nm irradiation was examined. Spectra were recorded under a controlled atmosphere and using a variety of conditions, including an experiment where the two lasers simultaneously irradiated the same area of the sample. There was never any indication of laser-induced changes to the sample.
2.3. UV−Vis DRS Measurements. DRS spectra in the range of 200−800 nm were taken on a Varian Cary 1E UV−vis spectrophotometer equipped with a diffuse-reflectance attachment, using MgO as a reference. The spectra of hydrated samples were collected under ambient conditions. For dehydrated samples, the V/Al2O3 sample was first calcined in an oven at 723 K for 2 h and then transferred into a desiccator and later into a glovebox. The sample was sealed into a small vial that is transparent in the range 200−800 nm, and the UV−vis DRS spectrum was measured at room temperature.
2.4. TPR. H2 TPR of V/δ- and γ-Al2O3 was carried out in a H2/Ar (5%) flow of 40 mL/min from room temperature to 1023 K with a ramp of 8 K/min. Prior to this, the samples (ca. 100 mg) were treated for 1 h at 773 K in pure O2, cooled to room temperature, and purged with Ar for at least 30 min. The H2 consumption was determined by a TCD detector, with H2O being trapped in a dry ice-cooled trap.
3. Results
3.1. Raman Spectra.3.1.1. V/δ-Al2O3. Visible Raman spectra of dehydrated V/δ-Al2O3 samples are presented in Figure 1A, which also includes the spectra of δ-Al2O3 and V2O5 for comparison. The spectra of V/δ-Al2O3 with surface VOx density lower than 0.16 V/nm2 are dominated by fluorescence from the δ-Al2O3 support. At a surface VOx density of 0.16 V/nm2, a weak Raman band is observed at 1023 cm-1 and a broad Raman feature appears at ca. 915 cm-1. The broad band at 915 cm-1 is present for all samples and becomes weaker at higher surface VOx density. The band at 1023 cm-1 shifts to higher wavenumbers and becomes very weak with increasing surface VOx density. An intense Raman band at 995 cm-1 characteristic of crystalline V2O5 appears at a surface VOx density of 4.4 V/nm2 and above (parts e−g of Figure 1A). At a surface VOx density of 8 V/nm2, which is approximately monolayer coverage for VOx on Al2O3,6,8,12,26 the Raman band of V2O5 is very intense, and the other two bands at 1035 and 915 cm-1 become very weak.

The Raman band at ca. 1023 cm-1 can be assigned to the VO stretching mode of surface VOx species. The broad band at ∼915 cm-1 has previously been ascribed to VOV stretching modes and used as a proof for the presence of polymerized VOx species.4-15 Here we assign it to the interface mode, VOAl, in accordance with recent DFT calculations of the VOx−Al2O3 system. 27 This assignment is confirmed by the UV Raman results described below.
Figure 1B shows the Raman spectra of hydrated V/δ-Al2O3 which are quite different from those of the dehydrated samples. No Raman feature can be observed for the samples with surface VOx density below 1.2 V/nm2. At 1.2 V/nm2, a very broad Raman feature appears, centered at 930 cm-1 and extending over the spectral range of 800−1050 cm-1. At higher density, this feature becomes weaker and evolves into a shoulder on the lower wavenumber side of the V2O5 band at 994 cm-1. With the exception of a change in the background slope, the Raman spectrum of V2O5 is essentially identical for hydrated and dehydrated samples. The broad Raman feature may be due to surface polyvanadates on δ-Al2O3.8,11,28,29 The absence of Raman bands above 1000 cm-1 due to VO vibration in Figure 1B is attributed to hydrolysis of the VO bond by water adsorbed from the atmosphere.
Figure 2A shows the UV Raman spectra of dehydrated V/δ-Al2O3 with surface VOx density varying from 0.01 to 14.2 V/nm2. Two bands of medium intensity at 837 and 740 cm-1 are observed for the δ-Al2O3 support. The two bands decline in intensity with increasing surface VOx density and disappear at a surface VOx density of 0.16 V/ nm2. This is attributed to strong absorption of the UV radiation by surface VOx species (see following UV−vis DRS results).
Figure 2 UV (λexcitation = 244 nm) Raman spectra of dehydrated (A) and hydrated (B) V/δ-Al2O3 as a function of surface VOx density (V/nm2).
It is striking to note that some Raman features due to surface VOx species can be distinguished for V/δ-Al2O3 samples at extremely low surface density even down to 0.01 V/nm2, i.e., a weak Raman band at 1013 cm-1 and a broad shoulder at around 912 cm-1 (Figure 2Ab). These Raman features cannot be detected in the visible Raman spectra (see Figure 1) and have not been reported by previous Raman studies. The broad feature centered at 912 cm-1 is present with medium intensity at all loadings, suggesting that this broad Raman feature cannot be exclusively assigned to VOV stretching. The 1013-cm-1 band, assigned to the VO stretching mode of surface VOx species, shifts gradually to a higher wavenumber as the surface VOx density increases. This band remains observable at ca. 1026 cm-1 for a surface VOx density of 14.2 V/nm2, a result which is clearly different from the visible Raman spectra (Figure 1) where the VO band is above 1030 cm-1 for surface VOx densities greater than 1.2 V/nm2 and disappears above monolayer loading (8 V/nm2). The differences in Raman shift and in intensity vs VOx density between visible- and UV-excited Raman spectra suggest the presence of different types of surface VOx species on the Al2O3 support. At medium surface VOx densities (0.16−4.4 V/nm2), a weak broad feature appears near 625 cm-1. This band is attributed to symmetric stretching of VOV chains,3-15 indicating the formation of polymerized VOx species on the surface. When the surface VOx density is above 8 V/nm2, the formation of crystalline V2O5 is evident from the characteristic band at 994 cm-1 and additional bands in the range 400−600 cm-1.
UV Raman spectra of hydrated V/δ-Al2O3 are shown in Figure 2B. In a manner similar to the visible spectra (Figure 1B), Raman bands above 1000 cm-1 due to terminal VO vibrations disappear upon hydration for all V/δ-Al2O3 samples. V/δ-Al2O3 samples with low surface density show a broad feature at around 910 cm-1. The band maximum shifts to higher wavenumbers with increased surface density, i.e., to 930 cm-1 for 1.2 V, to 980 cm-1 for 4.4 V, and up to 995 cm-1 for 8- and 14.2-V samples. A broad band at ∼550 cm-1 is also observed at intermediate surface density (parts d−f of Figure 2B). These broad Raman features imply the presence of polyvanadate species on the surface of hydrated V/δ-Al2O3.3-6,8
3.1.2. V/γ-Al2O3. Parts A and B of Figure 3 present the visible Raman spectra of dehydrated and hydrated V/γ-Al2O3 samples, respectively. Dehydrated samples (Figure 3A) with surface densities above 0.16 V/nm2 show Raman bands due to VOx species:  a weak broad band centered at 910 cm-1 due to the VOAl mode, a VO vibration at 1028 cm-1 for 1.2 V and 1034 cm-1 for 4.4- and 8.8-V samples, and an intense band at 994 cm-1 characteristic of V2O5 for 4.4 V and above. For hydrated samples, a broad Raman feature centered at 900 cm-1 covers the whole spectral range (800−1050 cm-1) at surface VOx densities of 0.16 and 1.2 V/nm2. It becomes a shoulder on the lower wavenumber side of the V2O5 band at 994 cm-1 at higher VOx density.

UV Raman spectra of dehydrated and hydrated V/γ-Al2O3 are, respectively, shown in parts A and B of Figure 4. γ-Al2O3 gives rise to a broad Raman band at ∼855 cm-1 in both hydrated and dehydrated states. It is obvious that the changes in UV Raman spectra as a function of surface VOx density on γ-Al2O3 (parts A and B of Figure 4) exhibit similar trends to those on δ-Al2O3 (parts A and B of Figure 2). Briefly, for dehydrated V/γ-Al2O3 samples, the broad Raman feature at ∼910 cm-1 is present on all samples; the VO vibration mode of surface VOx species gives Raman bands in the range 1012−1027 cm-1; a broad Raman feature due to VOV stretching at ∼630 cm-1 appears at intermediate surface VOx density, and V2O5 forms on the surface at and above monolayer density (8 V/nm2). For hydrated samples, broad bands in the range 910−995 cm-1 are observed from low surface density to high surface density, which are due to hydrated, polymerized VOx species.8,11 The polymerized VOx species are also characterized by the broad Raman feature at ∼545 cm-1 (parts c−e of Figure 4B).

3.2. UV−Vis DRS Spectra. UV−Vis spectra of dehydrated and hydrated V/δ-Al2O3 are shown in parts A and B of Figure 5, respectively. In both figures, the main electronic absorption band shifts to higher wavelengths and becomes broader with increasing surface VOx density. The broad band is due to the charge-transfer transition between oxygen ligands and vanadium metal centers. 30 The dehydrated samples with low surface VOx density (<1.2 V/nm2) show absorption primarily at ∼260 nm in the UV region while those with high surface density (≥1.2 V/nm2) exhibit a much broader absorption band in the UV region, and the absorption tail extends into visible region. This trend is consistent with the growth in domain size and change of coordination structure expected as more VOx is deposited on the surface.11,31,32 Hydration of all samples leads to a slight broadening of the electronic absorption band, indicating some changes in coordination of the surface VOx species.
Figure 5 UV−vis DRS spectra of dehydrated (A) and hydrated (B) V/δ-Al2O3 as a function of surface VOx density (V/nm2).
Supported vanadia catalysts have been extensively studied using UV−vis DRS, and the spectra were usually very broad.11,31,32,33 By comparison with those of model vanadium compounds,32 UV−vis absorption bands at around 240 and 290 nm were assigned to tetrahedrally coordinated monovanadate. The bands at 270, 340, and 412 nm have been ascribed to polyvanadate in either tetrahedral or pentahedral coordination.31 Crystalline V2O5 shows several bands in the range 220−650 nm.33 Thus, the UV−vis spectra in Figure 5A imply that tetrahedral VOx species are present on the support surface at surface densities below 1.2 V/nm2 while pentahedral VOx and V2O5 are the main species at surface densities above 1.2 V/nm2. When the dehydrated samples were hydrated, the UV−vis spectra were slightly broadened, suggesting that polyvanadate species exist to a larger extent on the support.
The UV−vis spectral features observed on dehydrated and hydrated V/γ-Al2O3 are similar to those on V/δ-Al2O3 and not shown here, implying a similar coordination structure of VOx species on both γ-Al2O3 and δ-Al2O3 in either the hydrated or dehydrated state. It should be noted that UV−vis spectra of V/Al2O3 samples with surface densities lower than 0.12 V/nm2 have not been studied previously and those of V/Al2O3 with surface density higher than 0.12 V/nm2 do not show significant difference from what have been reported for V/Al2O3 in the literature.14,33
3.3. H2 TPR Profiles. Parts A and B of Figure 6 present the TPR profiles of VOx supported on δ- and γ-Al2O3, respectively. The TPR profiles of the aluminas and V2O5 are also shown for comparison. The pure aluminas do not show evident reduction in the temperature range of room temperature through 1023 K. Reduction of V2O5 results in two sharp peaks at 956 and 981 K, similar to the profiles for V2O5 reported previously. 34 For all supported VOx samples, the reduction peak maxima shift as a function of surface VOx density, i.e., to lower temperatures and then back to higher temperatures, in agreement with data for V/Al2O3 found in the literature. 35,36 For example, in Figure 6A, the peak maximum at ∼903 K for 0.16 V shifts to 802 K for 1.2 V, to 784 K for 4.4 V, back to 803 K for 8 V, and to 818 K with a split at 868 K for 14.2 V. In the case of γ-Al2O3-supported VOx (Figure 6B), the maximum of the reduction peak is at ∼873 K for the 0.16-V sample; it shifts to 805 K for 1.2 V, to 787 K for 4.4 V, to 791 K for 8 V, and to 815 K with a shoulder at 849 K for 14.2 V.

4. Discussion
4.1. Structures of Supported VOx Species. Raman spectra of vanadia supported on aluminas (mainly γ-Al2O3) under hydrated and dehydrated conditions have been extensively researched.3-14,17,18,27-29,35,37-40 These literature studies were usually based on the investigation of V/γ-Al2O3 with VOx loading in the range 1−30%, corresponding to surface densities of approximately 0.3−34.2 V/nm2, depending on the surface area of the γ-Al2O3 used.9,12 In our Raman studies, supported vanadia species were investigated on two different aluminas with surface VOx densities in the range 0.01−14.2 V/nm2. VOx samples with higher surface density were not studied because V2O5 already formed when surface VOx density is above 8 V/nm2 (see Figures 1−4). However, we did investigate V/Al2O3 samples with extremely low surface VOx density (down to 0.01 V/nm2), which would give meaningful information on the initial structure of surface VOx species and their interactions with Al2O3. Depending on the surface VOx density, several sets of Raman bands are observed in the Raman spectra of V/Al2O3 samples:  a broad one in the range 500−700 cm-1, an intense one at 995 cm-2, a broad one at ∼910 cm-1, and sharp bands in the range 1010−1035 cm-1. The former two bands are obviously due to V−O−V vibration and V2O5, respectively. We focus our attention on the latter two sets of Raman bands as they provide more structural information on the supported VOx species.
The assignment of the bands above 1000 cm-1 is straightforward:  it is due to the VO stretching vibration. It is interesting that two kinds of shift of this band can be distinguished:  a shift as a function of excitation wavelength for the same sample and a shift as a function of surface VOx density for different samples. The former shift is caused by different VOx structures detected at different excitations and will be further discussed in section 4.2. The latter shift, from 1012 to 1027 cm-1 as the surface VOx density increases from 0.01 to 14.2 V/nm2 in the case of UV-excited Raman spectra (see Figures 2 and 4), is due to changes in the VOx structure. With increasing surface coverage, VOx species evolve from monovanadates to polyvanadates and crystalline V2O5 on the Al2O3 support with evolving surface structures. A change in the surface structure would result in a change of the VO bond length and/or its coupling to other bonds in the structure and thus the shift of VO Raman band.9,10,15,37 For example, Hardcastle and Wachs35 surmised that the length of terminal VO bonds in a large number of vanadium-containing model compounds changes with the structure and coordination of these compounds. They developed an empirical formula for relating the VO band frequency to its bond length.
The broad Raman band at ∼910 cm-1, conventionally attributed to V−O−V of polyvanadates, is observed on V/Al2O3 samples at all surface densities, even as low as 0.01 V/nm2. Since it is unlikely that polymerized VOx has formed at these low loadings, this band should no longer be considered as an identification of polymerized VOx. This point was also previously suggested by Deo et al.3 but was not proved conclusively. Very recently, DFT calculations on the interaction of VOx with Al2O3 (both corundum and spinel structures)27 concluded that the interface mode, V−O−Al, gives intense Raman band in the range 900−950 cm-1 for VOx supported on Al2O3 with the spinel structure. Since both δ- and γ-Al2O3 have the spinel-type structure and the broad Raman band at ∼910 cm-1 is observed on V/δ- and γ-Al2O3 even at the lowest coverages, this band is assigned to the V−O−Al interface mode. This band was observed in previous studies but was incorrectly assigned to the bridging V−O−V mode.5-7,9,10,40 Previous Raman studies5,6,10 assumed that the Raman cross section of interface V−O−Al vibrations is very small or zero. The direct observation of the interface mode in Raman spectroscopy is of significance to the understanding of redox reactions catalyzed by supported vanadia catalysts because the bridging V−O−S bond has been considered as a key active site for these reactions.4-6,13,18
A brief summary of the Raman results of vanadia supported on both δ- and γ-Al2O3 can be made based on above assignments:  Raman features due to VO and VOAl vibrations are observed at surface densities as low as 0.01 V/nm2; broad bands due to VOV vibrations and an intense band due to V2O5 appear at medium and high surface VOx density. By combination of the Raman results with the corresponding UV−vis DRS spectra (Figures 5), the structural evolution of surface VOx species on both aluminas can be described as follows:  V/Al2O3 with a surface density lower than 1.2 V/nm2 possesses mainly isolated VOx in tetrahedral coordination. 32,41 At surface densities higher than 1.2 V/nm2, polymerized VOx participate to a larger extent on the surface, and V2O5 forms at a surface VOx density above 4.4 V/nm2. Following this evolution picture of surface VOx species, it appears that the VO stretches in isolated VOx species occur at lower wavenumbers than in polymerized VOx species (Figures 2 and 4). This observation is consistent with most literature results that the frequency of VO stretches shows approximately a 10−15-cm-1 shift to higher wavenumbers with increasing VOx coverage.9,10 However, the opposite conclusion was also reported:  isolated VOx species give rise to VO stretches at higher wavenumbers than polymerized VOx.13 On the basis of this assignment and the reactivity tests, the authors concluded that isolated VOx species on γ-Al2O3 are more relevant to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.13 But our results suggest that the assignment of the VO stretching bands in ref 13 should be revised and that the conclusion based on this assignment should also be revised.
The TPR results of V/δ- and γ-Al2O3 (Figure 6) provide further information on the distribution and reducibility of surface VOx species. The high-temperature peak at ca. 873−903 K is mainly due to isolated adsorbed vanadia species that bind strongly to the alumina support, presumably via three V−O−Al bonds. The reduction temperature of isolated VOx species is higher than normal oxidative dehydrogenation and even dehydrogenation reaction temperatures. This indicates that isolated VOx species may not play a critical role in these reactions. The reduction peak at 783−823 K can be attributed to clustered VOx species. And the peak/shoulder at around 843−873 K is assigned to well-dispersed V2O5, which possesses a very small particle size and thus is easier to reduce than unsupported bulk V2O5. It is expected that this peak would approach those of bulk V2O5 when the surface VOx density increases further. By considertion of the areas of the reduction peaks due to V2O5 and polyvanadates, V2O5 has not become the main surface species at surface densities up to 14.2 V/nm2, even though the V2O5 bands dominate the Raman spectra (e.g., Figures 1−4). Their strong intensity is due to the much larger Raman cross section of V2O5 compared to dispersed vanadia species.26 The similarity of the TPR profiles of vanadia on δ- and γ-Al2O3 shows that the support phase (environment) has little effect on the reducibility of the three surface VOx species.
For hydrated V/Al2O3 samples, the surface vanadia species were found to depend on the net pH at the point of zero charge of the surface and can be predicted from the known vanadia aqueous phase diagram.3-6,8,39 In reference to the previous Raman study of vanadia on γ-Al2O3,8 the broad band from 920 to 990 cm-1 on V/δ- and γ-Al2O3 (Figures 2B and 4B) can be assigned to VO stretching in the polyvanadate structure. The hydrolysis of the terminal VO bond and interface VOAl bonds under ambient conditions by water moisture leads to the aggregation of surface VOx into polyvanadates.8,39 This conclusion is supported by the UV−vis DRS spectra of hydrated V/δ- and γ-Al2O3 (see Figure 6B), which show broadened absorption bands compared to the corresponding dehydrated samples (Figure 6A). The Raman study of supported VOx in the hydrated state is potentially useful for providing structural information on surface VOx in reactions where moisture is present in the feed gas or as a reaction product. Thus the properties of supported VOx under reaction conditions can be better understood.
The Raman, UV−vis DRS and H2 TPR results indicate that the structure, distribution, and reducibility of surface VOx species on δ- and γ-Al2O3 are quite similar. This similarity is understandable since both δ- and γ-Al2O3 have a spinel structure with similar types (but different distribution) of surface hydroxyl groups,41,43 which are the bonding sites for VOx species on the aluminas. Some slight spectral differences between V/γ-Al2O3 and V/δ-Al2O3 are discernible. In the visible Raman spectra (Figures 1 and 3), bands due to surface VOx species can be detected on V/δ-Al2O3 at a surface density of 0.16 V/nm2 while VOx species on γ-Al2O3 are only detectable at 1.2 V/nm2, suggesting that VOx species feature a higher dispersion on the surface of γ-Al2O3 than on δ-Al2O3. The higher dispersion of VOx on γ-Al2O3 is evidenced by the spectra at higher surface density:  the band at ca. 1035 cm-1, due to dispersed VOx, is still observable at a surface density of 8 V/ nm2 on γ-Al2O3 (Figure 3) while it has disappeared on V/δ-Al2O3 (Figure 1); the intensity ratio of the bands at 995 and 1026 cm-1 is smaller for V/γ-Al2O3 at the surface density of 8 V/nm2 (Figure 4) than for V/δ-Al2O3 (Figure 2). The H2 TPR profiles also show that VOx species are better dispersed on γ-Al2O3 than on δ-Al2O3 because the reduction peak due to V2O5 at around 849−873 K is more evident for V/ δ-Al2O3 than V/γ-Al2O3 at the same surface density of 14.2 V/nm2 (Figure 6). This is consistent with our motivation for comparing vanadia on δ- and γ-Al2O3 because the density of surface hydroxyl groups on the two aluminas was thought to be different.43 More reactive hydroxyl groups were found on γ-Al2O3 than on δ-Al2O3 so that δ-Al2O3 is less active than γ-Al2O3.44 This explains the better dispersion of VOx species on γ-Al2O3 than on δ-Al2O3.
4.2. Multiline Excitation:  UV vs Visible Excitation. The initial motivation for using different excitation laser lines was to investigate the use of the resonance enhancement effect to selectively detect different structures of vanadia on Al2O3. This possibility has been shown by the Raman and UV−vis DRS results presented here. To use dehydrated V/δ-Al2O3 as an example, a comparison of the Raman spectra excited by visible laser (Figure 1A) to those excited by UV laser (Figure 2A) shows at least three differences between the UV and visible spectra:
(1) UV Raman spectra show clear Raman bands due to supported VOx species at surface densities much lower than in visible Raman spectra. On one hand, this is due to the low signal levels and interference from fluorescence on Al2O3 in visible Raman when the surface VOx density is very low (e.g., <0.16 V/nm2). On the other hand, the avoidance of fluorescence and the resonance enhancement of isolated VOx species in UV Raman make them detectable. The selective resonance enhancement effect is evidenced by the UV−vis DRS spectra of V/δ-Al2O3 (Figure 5A). When the surface density is lower than 1.2 V/nm2, the electronic absorption band occurs only in the UV region where 244-nm excitation leads to the resonance Raman effect while 488-nm excitation is not resonance enhanced.
(2) The spectra of the same sample show VO stretching bands at different Raman shifts, 8−10 cm-1 lower in UV Raman than in visible Raman, indicating that UV and visible excitations detect different VOx species present on the support. This kind of band shift can also be explained in terms of the resonance enhancement effect. The UV−vis absorption spectra of V/δ-Al2O3 (Figure 5A) show significant absorption bands at both 244- and 488-nm laser wavelengths for samples with surface densities above 1.2 V/nm2, which implies that the Raman spectra at both wavelengths are resonance enhanced. The longer wavelength absorption increases in intensity with vanadia loading, relative to the short wavelength absorption. This demonstrates that a mixture of surface vanadia species is present and is consistent with a picture where polymerized VOx species are resonance enhanced under visible laser excitation, while isolated and less polymerized VOx are resonance enhanced under UV laser excitation. The selective enhancement of VOx species with different cluster sizes is similar to the case of resonance Raman spectroscopic characterization of conjugated polyene sequences where different excitation wavelengths give different CC stretching frequencies, and thus conjugated polyenes with different sequence lengths are detected.45 Interestingly, the higher VO Raman shift measured under visible compared to UV excitation is consistent with this picture by reference to the measurements on the model catalysts since the VO infrared frequencies are found to increase with increasing VO surface density.46 Thus, it would appear that visible-excited Raman spectra are more sensitive to polymeric or cluster VOx and that UV-excited Raman spectra are more sensitive to isolated and less polymerized VOx species.
(3) The VO stretching band at 995 cm-1 characteristic of V2O5 is seen at lower surface VOx densities in visible Raman spectra (Figure 1) than in UV Raman spectra (Figure 2). For example, this band is detected at a surface density of 4.4 V/ nm2 under visible excitation, while it is only observable at surface densities above 8 V/nm2 under UV excitation. This is due to the different absorption properties of V2O5 in both UV and visible regions. Though V2O5 shows electronic absorption in both regions,33 the absorption is much stronger in the UV region, and fewer scatterers contribute to the spectrum in UV Raman compared to visible Raman. Thus, UV Raman is less sensitive for monitoring crystalline V2O5 than visible Raman. This is more obvious in the measurement of unsupported V2O5, which shows that a comparable UV Raman spectrum requires a collection time typically three times longer than with visible wavelength excitation under similar experimental conditions. It is also in agreement with the principle that the Raman cross section is frequency dependent. Actually the influence of absorption on Raman spectra is also quite evident when the surface VOx density is very low for either V/δ-Al2O3 (Figure 2) or V/γ-Al2O3 (Figure 4). For example, the strong Raman bands due to δ-Al2O3 are hardly detectable even at a surface density of 0.16 V/nm2 (Figure 2), which is too small to completely cover the support surface. This is obviously due to the strong absorption of UV radiation by surface VOx species.
5. Conclusions
The surface vanadia species supported on δ- and γ-Al2O3 with surface density of 0.01−14.2 V/nm2 have been characterized under both hydrated and dehydrated conditions using both UV and visible Raman spectroscopy and UV−vis DRS. TPR was also employed to provide additional information on the structure and reducibility of the surface VOx species.
(1) Three kinds of surface VOx species are dispersed on the two aluminas under dehydrated conditions:  isolated VOx species are present at surface density below 1.2 V/nm2; polyvanadates starts to be the main surface species at surface densities in the range 1.2−14.2 V/nm2; V2O5 readily forms on the surface at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm2. The structure, distribution, and reducibility of dehydrated surface VOx species are similar on both δ- and γ-Al2O3 with the exception that VOx species are little better dispersed on γ-Al2O3 than on δ-Al2O3 due to differences in the density of surface hydroxyl groups. The surface VOx species behave similarly upon hydration on both aluminas, and polyvanadates are the main surface species. In summary, there exist only minor differences in dispersed VOx species on the two aluminas.
(2) The broad Raman band at ca. 910 cm-1, previously assigned to V−O−V vibrations in polyvanadates, is observed on V/Al2O3 with surface densities as low as 0.01 V/nm2 and is assigned to the interface mode (V−O−Al). This bridging bond has been considered as the key active site for the redox reactions catalyzed by supported VOx. The reassignment of this band makes it possible to get further insights into the redox mechanism via in situ Raman spectroscopy.
(3) Because of the resonance enhancement effect and the avoidance of fluorescence in UV Raman spectroscopy, UV Raman can provide structural information on VOx species at extremely low surface VOx density (down to 0.01 V/nm2), where the VOx is not detectable by visible Raman. At higher surface VOx density, UV Raman shows higher sensitivity to isolated and less polymerized VOx species while visible Raman is more sensitive to highly polymerized VOx species and crystalline V2O5, which is explained in terms of a selective resonance enhancement effect as evidenced by UV−vis DRS results. The present study suggests that a complete structural characterization of supported metal oxide catalysts requires a multiwavelength excitation approach in Raman spectroscopy.
