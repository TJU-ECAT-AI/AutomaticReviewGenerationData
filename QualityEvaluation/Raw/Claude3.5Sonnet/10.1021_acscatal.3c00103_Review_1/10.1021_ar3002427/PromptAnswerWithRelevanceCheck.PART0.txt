Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not contain any information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or its specific steps. The text focuses on sintering mechanisms of metal nanoparticles in catalysts, particularly Ostwald ripening and particle migration coalescence. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or related reaction mechanisms. Therefore, I cannot answer the question about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, its steps, or the debate regarding the rate-controlling step based on the given information.
