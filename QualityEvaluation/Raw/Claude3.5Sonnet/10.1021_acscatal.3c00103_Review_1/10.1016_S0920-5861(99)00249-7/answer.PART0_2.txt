<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not discuss the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or its specific steps. The document focuses on isobutane dehydrogenation over Pt/Sn catalysts and does not contain information about propane dehydrogenation or the ongoing debate regarding its rate-controlling step. Therefore, I cannot answer this question based on the given information.

所提供的文献并未讨论丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制或其具体步骤。该文档主要关注Pt/Sn催化剂上的异丁烷脱氢,不包含有关丙烷脱氢或其速率控制步骤的持续争论的信息。因此,我无法根据给定信息回答这个问题。
