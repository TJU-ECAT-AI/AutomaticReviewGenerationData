The given literature does not contain information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or its steps. The text focuses on ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts and does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or the specific mechanism asked about in the question. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given literature.

给定的文献中没有关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其步骤的信息。该文本主要讨论了Cr/Al2O3催化剂上的乙烷脱氢反应，并未涉及丙烷脱氢或问题中询问的具体机理。因此，我无法根据给定的文献回答这个问题。
