[1] "Recently we studied the adsorption of the possible intermediates and the pathways of propane dissociation on Pt(1 1 1) by density functional theory. The results revealed that propane is physically adsorbed on Pt because the propane molecule has no unpaired electron and cannot bind with Pt atom."

[2] "Trapping-mediated dissociative chemisorption indicated that the gas phase molecule is trapped in the potential field of the surface in the form of alkane, which accommodates to the temperature of the surface. The physically adsorbed molecule may then either desorb or dissociate."

[3] "Jackson et al. studied the dehydrogenation of propane over a chromium catalyst using isotopic labeling techniques coupled to transient flow methods and identified the rate determining step as the elimination of β-hydrogen from propyl radical."

[4] "Biloen et al. studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of π-bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

[5] "Suzuki and Kaneko investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane is physically adsorbed on the catalyst surface and then dissociates into adsorbed propyl and hydrogen.

2. β-H extraction: A β-hydrogen is extracted from the adsorbed propyl species to form adsorbed propene.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propene and hydrogen desorb from the catalyst surface.

There is an ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. Some studies, like those by Jackson et al. and Biloen et al., identified the β-hydrogen elimination as the rate-determining step. However, other researchers, such as Suzuki and Kaneko, proposed that the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane (which could be interpreted as part of the dissociative adsorption step) is rate-limiting.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, catalysts should be optimized for propane activation. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the focus should be on facilitating this step.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations may differ depending on which step is rate-limiting.

3. Kinetic modeling: The choice of rate-determining step affects the formulation of kinetic models and the interpretation of experimental data.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The uncertainty hinders a complete understanding of the reaction mechanism, which is crucial for process optimization and catalyst improvement.

5. Inhibition effects: The impact of product inhibition (by hydrogen or propene) may differ depending on which step is rate-limiting.

This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis and the need for advanced characterization techniques and theoretical studies to resolve such fundamental questions in catalytic processes.

反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制的丙烷脱氢(PDH)包括三个步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面物理吸附，然后解离成吸附的丙基和氢。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中提取一个β-氢，形成吸附的丙烯。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯和氢从催化剂表面脱附。

关于解离吸附还是β-H提取是该反应的速率控制步骤，目前存在争议。一些研究，如Jackson等人和Biloen等人的研究，将β-氢消除识别为速率决定步骤。然而，其他研究者，如Suzuki和Kaneko，提出吸附丙烷的脱氢（可以解释为解离吸附步骤的一部分）是速率限制步骤。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程产生了几方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，应该优化催化剂以促进丙烷活化。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，重点应该放在促进这一步骤上。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和反应物浓度可能会因速率限制步骤的不同而有所不同。

3. 动力学建模：速率决定步骤的选择影响动力学模型的制定和实验数据的解释。

4. 机理理解：这种不确定性阻碍了对反应机理的完全理解，而这对过程优化和催化剂改进至关重要。

5. 抑制效应：产物（氢气或丙烯）抑制的影响可能因速率限制步骤的不同而不同。

这种持续的争论凸显了多相催化的复杂性，以及需要先进的表征技术和理论研究来解决催化过程中的这些基本问题。
