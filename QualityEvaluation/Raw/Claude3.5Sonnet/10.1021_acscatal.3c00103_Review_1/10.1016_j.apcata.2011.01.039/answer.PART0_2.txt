[1] "The mechanisms of dehydrogenation on several catalysts have been studied in a number of investigations. Jackson et al. [16] studied the dehydrogenation of propane over a chromium catalyst using isotopic labeling techniques coupled to transient flow methods and identified the rate determining step as the elimination of β-hydrogen from propyl radical."

[2] "Biloen et al. [23] studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of π-bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

[3] "Suzuki and Kaneko [24] investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane."

[4] "Recently we [25] studied the adsorption of the possible intermediates and the pathways of propane dissociation on Pt(1 1 1) by density functional theory. The results revealed that propane is physically adsorbed on Pt because the propane molecule has no unpaired electron and cannot bind with Pt atom."

[5] "The model (M3) cannot well describe the experimental results, which is in accordance with the above discussions that the second dehydrogenation, namely propyl dehydrogenation could not be the rate-determining step. However, this is in disagreement with the results of Biloen et al. [23]. The contraversial results were also observed on Cr catalysts [16], [24]. This implies that the rate determining step may be dependent on the structure of the catalyst, e.g. the size and surface orientation."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and dissociates into adsorbed propyl and hydrogen.

2. β-H extraction: A β-hydrogen is extracted from the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propene.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propene desorbs from the catalyst surface, completing the dehydrogenation process.

There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction. Some studies suggest that the β-H extraction is the rate-determining step, while others propose that the dissociative adsorption of propane is the rate-limiting step.

The literature presents conflicting evidence:

- Jackson et al. and Biloen et al. identified β-hydrogen elimination as the rate-determining step for chromium and platinum catalysts, respectively.
- Suzuki and Kaneko proposed that the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane (dissociative adsorption) was the rate-determining step for chromium-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts.
- Recent density functional theory studies suggest that propane is only physically adsorbed on Pt surfaces, which could imply that dissociative adsorption might be rate-limiting.

The uncertainty regarding the rate-controlling step significantly impacts our understanding of the PDH process. It affects:

1. Catalyst design: Different rate-limiting steps would require different catalyst optimization strategies.
2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations may vary depending on which step is rate-limiting.
3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models are crucial for process design and optimization, and they depend on correctly identifying the rate-determining step.
4. Mechanistic understanding: The debate highlights gaps in our fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism on different catalyst surfaces.

The literature suggests that the rate-determining step may be dependent on the catalyst structure, including particle size and surface orientation. This complexity underscores the need for further research to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the PDH process across different catalyst systems and reaction conditions.

反向Horiuti-Polanyi机理的丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面吸附并解离成吸附的丙基和氢。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中提取一个β-氢，形成吸附的丙烯。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附，完成脱氢过程。

科学界对PDH反应中哪一步是速率控制步骤存在持续争议。一些研究表明β-H提取是速率决定步骤，而其他研究则提出丙烷的解离吸附是限速步骤。

文献中呈现了相互矛盾的证据：

- Jackson等人和Biloen等人分别确定了β-氢消除是铬和铂催化剂的速率决定步骤。
- Suzuki和Kaneko提出，对于铬-氧化铝-氧化钾催化剂，吸附丙烷的脱氢（解离吸附）是速率决定步骤。
- 最近的密度泛函理论研究表明，丙烷在Pt表面上只是物理吸附，这可能意味着解离吸附可能是限速步骤。

关于速率控制步骤的不确定性显著影响了我们对PDH过程的理解。它影响到：

1. 催化剂设计：不同的限速步骤会需要不同的催化剂优化策略。
2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和反应物浓度可能会因限速步骤的不同而变化。
3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型对过程设计和优化至关重要，它们取决于正确识别速率决定步骤。
4. 机理理解：这场争论凸显了我们对不同催化剂表面上反应机理的基本理解存在差距。

文献表明，速率决定步骤可能取决于催化剂结构，包括粒子大小和表面取向。这种复杂性强调了需要进一步研究，以在不同催化剂系统和反应条件下对PDH过程发展更全面的理解。
