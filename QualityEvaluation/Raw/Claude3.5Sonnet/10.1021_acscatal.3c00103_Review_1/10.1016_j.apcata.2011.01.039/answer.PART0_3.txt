[1] "Recently we studied the adsorption of the possible intermediates and the pathways of propane dissociation on Pt(1 1 1) by density functional theory. The results revealed that propane is physically adsorbed on Pt because the propane molecule has no unpaired electron and cannot bind with Pt atom."

[2] "Trapping-mediated dissociative chemisorption indicated that the gas phase molecule is trapped in the potential field of the surface in the form of alkane, which accommodates to the temperature of the surface. The physically adsorbed molecule may then either desorb or dissociate."

[3] "Jackson et al. studied the dehydrogenation of propane over a chromium catalyst using isotopic labeling techniques coupled to transient flow methods and identified the rate determining step as the elimination of β-hydrogen from propyl radical."

[4] "Biloen et al. studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of π-bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

[5] "Suzuki and Kaneko investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane is physically adsorbed onto the catalyst surface and then dissociates into adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A β-hydrogen is extracted from the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propene molecule.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propene molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface.

There is an ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. Some studies, such as those by Jackson et al. and Biloen et al., identified the β-hydrogen elimination as the rate-determining step. However, Suzuki and Kaneko proposed that the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane (which could be interpreted as the dissociative adsorption step) was rate-determining.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-controlling, catalysts should be designed to facilitate propane adsorption and dissociation. If β-H extraction is rate-controlling, catalyst design should focus on optimizing the extraction of β-hydrogen.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.) may differ depending on which step is rate-controlling.

3. Kinetic modeling: The choice of rate-determining step affects the formulation of kinetic models, which in turn impacts process design and optimization.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The uncertainty hinders a complete understanding of the reaction mechanism, which is crucial for developing improved catalysts and processes.

5. Interpretation of experimental data: Depending on which step is assumed to be rate-controlling, experimental data may be interpreted differently, leading to potentially conflicting conclusions.

This debate underscores the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis and highlights the need for further research combining advanced experimental techniques and theoretical modeling to definitively identify the rate-controlling step in propane dehydrogenation.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi丙烷脱氢(PDH)机制包括三个步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面物理吸附，然后解离成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中提取β-氢，形成吸附的丙烯分子。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是该反应的速率控制步骤，目前存在争议。一些研究，如Jackson等人和Biloen等人的研究，将β-氢消除确定为速率决定步骤。然而，Suzuki和Kaneko提出，吸附丙烷的脱氢（可以解释为解离吸附步骤）是速率决定步骤。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率控制步骤，催化剂的设计应该致力于促进丙烷的吸附和解离。如果β-H提取是速率控制步骤，催化剂设计应该集中在优化β-氢的提取。

2. 反应条件：最佳反应条件（温度、压力等）可能会因速率控制步骤的不同而有所不同。

3. 动力学建模：速率决定步骤的选择会影响动力学模型的制定，进而影响过程设计和优化。

4. 机理理解：这种不确定性阻碍了对反应机理的完整理解，而这对开发改进的催化剂和工艺至关重要。

5. 实验数据解释：根据假定的速率控制步骤的不同，实验数据可能会被不同地解释，导致可能相互矛盾的结论。

这场争论凸显了多相催化的复杂性，并强调了需要进一步的研究，结合先进的实验技术和理论建模，以明确确定丙烷脱氢中的速率控制步骤。
