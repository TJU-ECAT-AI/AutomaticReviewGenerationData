[1] "Biloen et al. [23] studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of π-bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

[4] "The model (M3) cannot well describe the experimental results, which is in accordance with the above discussions that the second dehydrogenation, namely propyl dehydrogenation could not be the rate-determining step. However, this is in disagreement with the results of Biloen et al. [23]. The contraversial results were also observed on Cr catalysts [16], [24]. This implies that the rate determining step may be dependent on the structure of the catalyst, e.g. the size and surface orientation."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and dissociates, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is extracted from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propene molecule.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propene molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface, completing the dehydrogenation process.

There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction. Some researchers, like Biloen et al., suggest that the β-H extraction is the rate-determining step. Others, such as Suzuki and Kaneko, propose that the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane (which could be interpreted as the dissociative adsorption step) is rate-limiting.

The literature also presents a model where the first C-H bond cleavage is considered the rate-determining step, which aligns more closely with the dissociative adsorption being rate-limiting. However, the study acknowledges that experimental results do not support the second dehydrogenation (propyl dehydrogenation) as the rate-determining step, contradicting some earlier findings.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: Without a clear consensus on the rate-determining step, it's challenging to optimize catalyst properties to target the specific limiting step.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal reaction conditions may vary depending on which step is actually rate-limiting, affecting process design and operation.

3. Kinetic modeling: The development of accurate kinetic models is hampered by the uncertainty, potentially leading to less precise predictions of reactor performance.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The lack of agreement on the rate-determining step indicates an incomplete understanding of the reaction mechanism, which could hinder further improvements in the process.

5. Catalyst structure dependence: The literature suggests that the rate-determining step may depend on the catalyst structure, size, and surface orientation. This adds another layer of complexity to the debate and implies that a universal rate-determining step may not exist for all PDH catalysts.

In conclusion, the ongoing debate about the rate-controlling step in the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH highlights the complexity of the process and the need for further research to fully elucidate the reaction mechanism and its dependence on catalyst properties.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面吸附并解离，形成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种的β-碳上提取一个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯分子。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯分子从催化剂表面脱附，完成脱氢过程。

在科学界，关于PDH反应中哪一步是速率控制步骤存在持续争论。一些研究者，如Biloen等人，认为β-H提取是速率决定步骤。而其他人，如Suzuki和Kaneko，则提出吸附丙烷的脱氢（可以解释为解离吸附步骤）是速率限制步骤。

文献还提出了一个模型，认为第一个C-H键断裂是速率决定步骤，这更接近于解离吸附是速率限制的观点。然而，研究承认实验结果不支持第二次脱氢（丙基脱氢）作为速率决定步骤，这与一些早期的发现相矛盾。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程产生了几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：没有明确的速率决定步骤共识，难以优化催化剂性能以针对特定的限制步骤。

2. 反应条件：最佳反应条件可能会根据实际的速率限制步骤而变化，影响过程设计和操作。

3. 动力学建模：由于不确定性，开发准确的动力学模型受到阻碍，可能导致反应器性能预测不够精确。

4. 机理理解：对速率决定步骤缺乏一致意见表明对反应机理的理解不完整，可能阻碍过程的进一步改进。

5. 催化剂结构依赖性：文献表明，速率决定步骤可能取决于催化剂结构、尺寸和表面取向。这为争论增加了另一层复杂性，并暗示可能不存在适用于所有PDH催化剂的普遍速率决定步骤。

总之，关于PDH反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制中速率控制步骤的持续争论突显了该过程的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以充分阐明反应机理及其对催化剂性质的依赖性。

Some researchers, such as Jackson et al. and Biloen et al., have identified the β-H extraction step as the rate-determining step. They concluded that the conversion of the propyl radical to π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination is the slowest step in the process.

On the other hand, Suzuki and Kaneko proposed that the rate-determining step is the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane, which corresponds to the dissociative adsorption step. Recent density functional theory studies have also shown that propane is physically adsorbed on the catalyst surface and may then either desorb or dissociate, suggesting that the dissociative adsorption step could be crucial in determining the overall reaction rate.

This uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: Without a clear consensus on the rate-limiting step, it becomes challenging to optimize catalyst properties to specifically target and improve the slowest step.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.) may vary depending on which step is rate-controlling, making it difficult to determine the best operating parameters.

3. Kinetic modeling: The development of accurate kinetic models for the PDH process is hindered by the lack of agreement on the rate-determining step, potentially affecting process design and optimization.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The uncertainty leaves room for debate about the exact sequence and importance of elementary steps in the reaction mechanism.

5. Catalyst deactivation: Understanding which step is rate-limiting could provide insights into the causes of catalyst deactivation and guide strategies for improving catalyst stability.

In conclusion, the ongoing debate about the rate-controlling step in the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH highlights the complexity of the process and the need for further research to resolve this uncertainty and improve our overall understanding of the reaction mechanism.

另一方面，Suzuki和Kaneko提出，速率决定步骤是吸附丙烷的脱氢，这对应于解离吸附步骤。最近的密度泛函理论研究也表明，丙烷在催化剂表面物理吸附，然后可能脱附或解离，这表明解离吸附步骤可能对决定整体反应速率至关重要。

这种对速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，具体表现在以下几个方面：

1. 催化剂设计：由于对速率限制步骤没有明确共识，很难优化催化剂性能以专门针对和改善最慢的步骤。

2. 反应条件：最佳反应条件（温度、压力等）可能会根据哪个步骤是速率控制步骤而变化，这使得确定最佳操作参数变得困难。

3. 动力学建模：由于对速率决定步骤缺乏共识，PDH过程的准确动力学模型的开发受到阻碍，可能影响过程设计和优化。

4. 机理理解：这种不确定性为反应机理中基本步骤的确切顺序和重要性的争论留下了空间。

5. 催化剂失活：了解哪个步骤是速率限制步骤可能为催化剂失活的原因提供洞见，并指导改善催化剂稳定性的策略。

总之，关于PDH反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制中速率控制步骤的持续争论突出了该过程的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以解决这种不确定性并改善我们对反应机理的整体理解。

There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction. Some studies suggest that the β-H extraction is the rate-determining step, while others propose that the dissociative adsorption of propane is the rate-limiting step.

The literature presents conflicting evidence:

- Jackson et al. and Biloen et al. identified β-hydrogen elimination as the rate-determining step for chromium and platinum catalysts, respectively.
- Suzuki and Kaneko proposed that the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane (dissociative adsorption) was the rate-determining step for chromium-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts.
- Recent density functional theory studies suggest that propane is only physically adsorbed on Pt surfaces, which could imply that dissociative adsorption might be rate-limiting.

The uncertainty regarding the rate-controlling step significantly impacts our understanding of the PDH process. It affects:

1. Catalyst design: Different rate-limiting steps would require different catalyst optimization strategies.
2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations may vary depending on which step is rate-limiting.
3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models are crucial for process design and optimization, and they depend on correctly identifying the rate-determining step.
4. Mechanistic understanding: The debate highlights gaps in our fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism on different catalyst surfaces.

The literature suggests that the rate-determining step may be dependent on the catalyst structure, including particle size and surface orientation. This complexity underscores the need for further research to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the PDH process across different catalyst systems and reaction conditions.

科学界对PDH反应中哪一步是速率控制步骤存在持续争议。一些研究表明β-H提取是速率决定步骤，而其他研究则提出丙烷的解离吸附是限速步骤。

文献中呈现了相互矛盾的证据：

- Jackson等人和Biloen等人分别确定了β-氢消除是铬和铂催化剂的速率决定步骤。
