[1] "Recently we [25] studied the adsorption of the possible intermediates and the pathways of propane dissociation on Pt(1 1 1) by density functional theory. The results revealed that propane is physically adsorbed on Pt because the propane molecule has no unpaired electron and cannot bind with Pt atom."

[2] "Trapping-mediated dissociative chemisorption indicated that the gas phase molecule is trapped in the potential field of the surface in the form of alkane, which accommodates to the temperature of the surface [26]. The physically adsorbed molecule may then either desorb or dissociate."

[3] "Jackson et al. [16] studied the dehydrogenation of propane over a chromium catalyst using isotopic labeling techniques coupled to transient flow methods and identified the rate determining step as the elimination of β-hydrogen from propyl radical."

[4] "Biloen et al. [23] studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of π-bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

[5] "Suzuki and Kaneko [24] investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane is physically adsorbed on the catalyst surface and then dissociates into adsorbed propyl and hydrogen.

2. β-H extraction: A β-hydrogen is extracted from the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propene.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propene desorbs from the catalyst surface, completing the dehydrogenation process.

There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction. Some researchers, such as Jackson et al. and Biloen et al., have identified the β-H extraction step as the rate-determining step. They concluded that the conversion of the propyl radical to π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination is the slowest step in the process.

On the other hand, Suzuki and Kaneko proposed that the rate-determining step is the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane, which corresponds to the dissociative adsorption step. Recent density functional theory studies have also shown that propane is physically adsorbed on the catalyst surface and may then either desorb or dissociate, suggesting that the dissociative adsorption step could be crucial in determining the overall reaction rate.

This uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: Without a clear consensus on the rate-limiting step, it becomes challenging to optimize catalyst properties to specifically target and improve the slowest step.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.) may vary depending on which step is rate-controlling, making it difficult to determine the best operating parameters.

3. Kinetic modeling: The development of accurate kinetic models for the PDH process is hindered by the lack of agreement on the rate-determining step, potentially affecting process design and optimization.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The uncertainty leaves room for debate about the exact sequence and importance of elementary steps in the reaction mechanism.

5. Catalyst deactivation: Understanding which step is rate-limiting could provide insights into the causes of catalyst deactivation and guide strategies for improving catalyst stability.

In conclusion, the ongoing debate about the rate-controlling step in the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH highlights the complexity of the process and the need for further research to resolve this uncertainty and improve our overall understanding of the reaction mechanism.

反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制的丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面物理吸附，然后解离成吸附的丙基和氢。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中提取β-氢，形成吸附的丙烯。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附，完成脱氢过程。

在科学界，关于PDH反应中哪一步是速率控制步骤存在持续的争议。一些研究者，如Jackson等人和Biloen等人，将β-H提取步骤确定为速率决定步骤。他们得出结论，丙基自由基通过β-氢消除转化为π-键合丙烯是过程中最慢的步骤。

另一方面，Suzuki和Kaneko提出，速率决定步骤是吸附丙烷的脱氢，这对应于解离吸附步骤。最近的密度泛函理论研究也表明，丙烷在催化剂表面物理吸附，然后可能脱附或解离，这表明解离吸附步骤可能对决定整体反应速率至关重要。

这种对速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，具体表现在以下几个方面：

1. 催化剂设计：由于对速率限制步骤没有明确共识，很难优化催化剂性能以专门针对和改善最慢的步骤。

2. 反应条件：最佳反应条件（温度、压力等）可能会根据哪个步骤是速率控制步骤而变化，这使得确定最佳操作参数变得困难。

3. 动力学建模：由于对速率决定步骤缺乏共识，PDH过程的准确动力学模型的开发受到阻碍，可能影响过程设计和优化。

4. 机理理解：这种不确定性为反应机理中基本步骤的确切顺序和重要性的争论留下了空间。

5. 催化剂失活：了解哪个步骤是速率限制步骤可能为催化剂失活的原因提供洞见，并指导改善催化剂稳定性的策略。

总之，关于PDH反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制中速率控制步骤的持续争论突出了该过程的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以解决这种不确定性并改善我们对反应机理的整体理解。
