[1] "Biloen et al. [23] studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of π-bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

[2] "Suzuki and Kaneko [24] investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane."

[3] "If the first CH bond cleavage of propane (II1) is the rate-determining step, the rate expression can be derived as:"

[4] "The model (M3) cannot well describe the experimental results, which is in accordance with the above discussions that the second dehydrogenation, namely propyl dehydrogenation could not be the rate-determining step. However, this is in disagreement with the results of Biloen et al. [23]. The contraversial results were also observed on Cr catalysts [16], [24]. This implies that the rate determining step may be dependent on the structure of the catalyst, e.g. the size and surface orientation."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and dissociates, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is extracted from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propene molecule.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propene molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface, completing the dehydrogenation process.

There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction. Some researchers, like Biloen et al., suggest that the β-H extraction is the rate-determining step. Others, such as Suzuki and Kaneko, propose that the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane (which could be interpreted as the dissociative adsorption step) is rate-limiting.

The literature also presents a model where the first C-H bond cleavage is considered the rate-determining step, which aligns more closely with the dissociative adsorption being rate-limiting. However, the study acknowledges that experimental results do not support the second dehydrogenation (propyl dehydrogenation) as the rate-determining step, contradicting some earlier findings.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: Without a clear consensus on the rate-determining step, it's challenging to optimize catalyst properties to target the specific limiting step.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal reaction conditions may vary depending on which step is actually rate-limiting, affecting process design and operation.

3. Kinetic modeling: The development of accurate kinetic models is hampered by the uncertainty, potentially leading to less precise predictions of reactor performance.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The lack of agreement on the rate-determining step indicates an incomplete understanding of the reaction mechanism, which could hinder further improvements in the process.

5. Catalyst structure dependence: The literature suggests that the rate-determining step may depend on the catalyst structure, size, and surface orientation. This adds another layer of complexity to the debate and implies that a universal rate-determining step may not exist for all PDH catalysts.

In conclusion, the ongoing debate about the rate-controlling step in the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH highlights the complexity of the process and the need for further research to fully elucidate the reaction mechanism and its dependence on catalyst properties.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面吸附并解离，形成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种的β-碳上提取一个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯分子。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯分子从催化剂表面脱附，完成脱氢过程。

在科学界，关于PDH反应中哪一步是速率控制步骤存在持续争论。一些研究者，如Biloen等人，认为β-H提取是速率决定步骤。而其他人，如Suzuki和Kaneko，则提出吸附丙烷的脱氢（可以解释为解离吸附步骤）是速率限制步骤。

文献还提出了一个模型，认为第一个C-H键断裂是速率决定步骤，这更接近于解离吸附是速率限制的观点。然而，研究承认实验结果不支持第二次脱氢（丙基脱氢）作为速率决定步骤，这与一些早期的发现相矛盾。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程产生了几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：没有明确的速率决定步骤共识，难以优化催化剂性能以针对特定的限制步骤。

2. 反应条件：最佳反应条件可能会根据实际的速率限制步骤而变化，影响过程设计和操作。

3. 动力学建模：由于不确定性，开发准确的动力学模型受到阻碍，可能导致反应器性能预测不够精确。

4. 机理理解：对速率决定步骤缺乏一致意见表明对反应机理的理解不完整，可能阻碍过程的进一步改进。

5. 催化剂结构依赖性：文献表明，速率决定步骤可能取决于催化剂结构、尺寸和表面取向。这为争论增加了另一层复杂性，并暗示可能不存在适用于所有PDH催化剂的普遍速率决定步骤。

总之，关于PDH反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制中速率控制步骤的持续争论突显了该过程的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以充分阐明反应机理及其对催化剂性质的依赖性。
