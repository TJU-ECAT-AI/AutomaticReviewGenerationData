Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), its three steps, or the debate regarding the rate-controlling step. The document appears to be only a title and author information for a research article on size-dependent reaction mechanisms for propane dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts. Without access to the full text of the article, it is not possible to answer the question about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or discuss the ongoing debate about the rate-controlling step in PDH.

给出的文献中不包含任何关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制、其三个步骤或关于速率控制步骤的争论的信息。该文档似乎只是一篇关于Pt催化剂上丙烷脱氢的尺寸依赖反应机理的研究文章的标题和作者信息。没有访问文章的全文，无法回答关于反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制的问题或讨论PDH中速率控制步骤的持续争论。
