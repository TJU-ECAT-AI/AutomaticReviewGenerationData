Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), its three steps, or the debate regarding the rate-controlling step. The text appears to be a title and author list for a research article on single-atom-doped Ga2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide any details about the mechanism or kinetics of the reaction. Without relevant information in the provided text, I cannot answer the question or discuss the PDH process and its uncertainties.

给出的文献中没有关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制、其三个步骤或关于速率控制步骤的争论的信息。这段文字似乎是一篇关于单原子掺杂Ga2O3催化剂用于丙烷脱氢的研究文章的标题和作者列表，但没有提供任何关于反应机理或动力学的细节。由于所提供的文本中没有相关信息，我无法回答这个问题或讨论PDH过程及其不确定性。

The provided literature does not contain information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), its three steps, or the debate regarding the rate-controlling step. The text appears to be only a title and some bibliographic information for a research article on single-atom-doped Ga2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Without access to the full text of the article, it is not possible to answer the question about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or discuss the ongoing debate about the rate-controlling step in PDH.
