The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and dissociates, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is removed from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propylene intermediate.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene desorbs from the catalyst surface, producing gaseous propylene.

There is ongoing debate in the scientific community about whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. Some researchers argue that the initial C-H bond breaking during dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, while others suggest that the subsequent β-H extraction is the slowest step.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, catalysts should be optimized for C-H bond activation. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the focus should be on facilitating hydrogen removal.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations may differ depending on which step is rate-controlling.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require correct identification of the rate-limiting step to predict reaction rates and yields effectively.

4. Mechanistic studies: The focus of spectroscopic and computational investigations may need to be adjusted based on which step is believed to be rate-controlling.

5. Process optimization: Industrial PDH processes may be designed and operated differently depending on which step is considered rate-limiting.

Resolving this debate would allow for more targeted catalyst development, improved process design, and a deeper understanding of the fundamental chemistry involved in propane dehydrogenation.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷吸附在催化剂表面并解离，形成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种的β-碳上移除一个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯中间体。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附，产生气态丙烯。

科学界对于PDH中是解离吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤存在持续争论。一些研究人员认为解离吸附过程中的初始C-H键断裂是速率限制步骤，而其他人则认为随后的β-H提取是最慢的步骤。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程产生了几方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，催化剂应该针对C-H键活化进行优化。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，重点应该放在促进氢的移除上。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和反应物浓度可能会因速率控制步骤的不同而有所差异。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型需要正确识别速率限制步骤，以有效预测反应速率和产率。

4. 机理研究：光谱和计算研究的重点可能需要根据被认为是速率控制的步骤进行调整。

5. 工艺优化：工业PDH过程的设计和运行可能会根据被认为是速率限制的步骤而有所不同。

解决这一争论将有助于更有针对性的催化剂开发、改进工艺设计，并加深对丙烷脱氢基础化学原理的理解。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and dissociates into adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is removed from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl species, forming adsorbed propylene.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene desorbs from the catalyst surface as the product.

There is ongoing debate about whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. The literature provided does not directly address this debate or provide information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. However, we can infer from the DFT calculations presented that both steps have relatively low energy barriers on Pt catalysts, especially on stepped surfaces.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-controlling, catalyst design should focus on improving the initial binding of propane. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, efforts should concentrate on optimizing the catalyst's ability to remove hydrogen from adsorbed propyl species.

2. Reaction conditions: The rate-controlling step may influence the optimal temperature, pressure, and other reaction conditions for maximizing propylene yield.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models of the PDH process require correct identification of the rate-controlling step to predict reaction rates and yields under various conditions.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The uncertainty hinders a complete understanding of the reaction mechanism, which is crucial for developing improved catalysts and processes.

5. Scale-up and industrial application: Without a clear understanding of the rate-controlling step, optimizing PDH reactors and processes for large-scale production becomes more challenging.

Further research, including in-situ spectroscopic studies and more detailed computational investigations, is needed to resolve this debate and improve our understanding of the PDH process.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括三个步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面吸附并解离成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种的β碳上移除一个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附成为产物。

关于PDH中是解离吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤，目前仍存在争议。所提供的文献并未直接讨论这一争议或提供有关反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制的信息。然而，从所呈现的DFT计算结果可以推断，这两个步骤在Pt催化剂上的能量障碍都相对较低，特别是在台阶表面上。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率控制步骤，催化剂设计应该侧重于改善丙烷的初始结合。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，则应集中精力优化催化剂去除吸附丙基物种中氢的能力。

2. 反应条件：速率控制步骤可能影响最大化丙烯产率的最佳温度、压力和其他反应条件。

3. 动力学建模：PDH过程的准确动力学模型需要正确识别速率控制步骤，以预测各种条件下的反应速率和产率。

4. 机理理解：这种不确定性阻碍了对反应机理的完整理解，而这对开发改进的催化剂和工艺至关重要。

5. 规模扩大和工业应用：如果没有明确了解速率控制步骤，优化PDH反应器和大规模生产工艺将变得更具挑战性。

需要进行进一步的研究，包括原位光谱研究和更详细的计算调查，以解决这一争议并提高我们对PDH过程的理解。

2. Reaction conditions: The rate-determining step influences how temperature and pressure affect reaction rates.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate models require correct identification of the rate-limiting step.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The nature of the transition state and reaction intermediates depends on which step is rate-controlling.

5. Process optimization: Reactor design and operating conditions should target the slowest step for maximum efficiency.

Resolving this debate is crucial for developing more efficient PDH catalysts and processes. Further experimental and theoretical studies are needed to definitively determine the rate-controlling step under various conditions.
