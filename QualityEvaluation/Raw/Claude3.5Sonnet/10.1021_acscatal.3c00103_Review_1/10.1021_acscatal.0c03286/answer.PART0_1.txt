<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not directly discuss the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or its steps. The text focuses on the size dependence of Pt catalysts in PDH reactions but does not go into detail about the specific mechanism or rate-controlling steps. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given information.

To properly answer this question, additional information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, its steps, and the ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step would be needed. The literature provided does not contain the necessary details to address these aspects of PDH.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论丙烷脱氢(PDH)的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制或其步骤。文本主要集中在PDH反应中Pt催化剂的尺寸依赖性，但未详细说明具体机制或速率控制步骤。因此，我无法根据给定信息提供答案。

要正确回答这个问题，需要有关逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制、其步骤以及关于速率控制步骤的持续争论的额外信息。所提供的文献不包含解决PDH这些方面所需的必要细节。
