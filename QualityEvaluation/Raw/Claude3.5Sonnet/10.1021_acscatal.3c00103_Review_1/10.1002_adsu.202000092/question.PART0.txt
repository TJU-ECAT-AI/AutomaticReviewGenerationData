I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalyzed by PtSn/Al2O3 is a vital industrial process for producing propylene, a significant building block in the chemical industry. However, coke produced in the process deactivates the catalyst and the energy-intensive regeneration procedures can produce considerable CO2 emission. In this work, coke on the spent catalysts is analyzed by thermogravimetric-mass spectra, Raman spectra, 1H solid NMR spectra, and infrared spectra. Several C3 species, including propyl, propylidene and propylidyne are found on the surface of the PtSn alloy. Several reaction pathways are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is also found that this coke can be hydrogenated to propylene in the PDH process. These results could provide theoretical guidance for optimizing process parameters in industry.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
