<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), its three steps, or the debate regarding the rate-controlling step. The text focuses on coke formation on PtSn alloy catalysts during PDH and does not discuss the reaction mechanism in detail. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given information.
