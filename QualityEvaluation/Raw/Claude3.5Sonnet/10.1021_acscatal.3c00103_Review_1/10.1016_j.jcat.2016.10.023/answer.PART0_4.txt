The literature provided does not contain information specifically about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or details about its steps. The document focuses on coke formation during propane dehydrogenation on a Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst, but does not discuss the mechanistic details of the PDH reaction itself. Therefore, I cannot answer the question about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, its steps, or the debate regarding the rate-controlling step based on the given information.

所提供的文献中没有具体提到丙烷脱氢(PDH)的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制或其步骤的详细信息。该文档主要关注Pt/Mg(Al)Ox催化剂上丙烷脱氢过程中的积碳形成,但并未讨论PDH反应本身的机理细节。因此,我无法根据给定的信息回答关于逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制、其步骤或关于速率控制步骤争论的问题。
