<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain information specifically about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or details about its individual steps. The document focuses on coke formation during propane dehydrogenation on a Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst, rather than discussing the mechanistic details of the PDH reaction itself. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given information.

提供的文献中不包含有关丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制的具体信息,也没有讨论其各个步骤的细节。该文档主要关注在Pt/Mg(Al)Ox催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢过程中的积碳形成,而不是讨论PDH反应本身的机理细节。因此,我无法根据给定的信息回答这个问题。
