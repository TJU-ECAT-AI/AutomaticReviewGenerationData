The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is not explicitly described in the given literature. The document focuses on coking behavior and carbon deposit formation on Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, rather than detailing the specific steps of the dehydrogenation mechanism. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot accurately explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or discuss the debate regarding its rate-controlling step. The literature does not provide sufficient details to address this specific aspect of the PDH process.

所提供的文献中没有明确描述丙烷脱氢(PDH)的Horiuti-Polanyi机制。该文档主要关注丙烷脱氢过程中Pt催化剂上的积碳行为和碳沉积物的形成,而不是详细说明脱氢机制的具体步骤。由于文中没有相关信息,我无法准确解释反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制或讨论有关其速率控制步骤的争论。文献没有提供足够的细节来解决PDH过程的这一具体方面。
