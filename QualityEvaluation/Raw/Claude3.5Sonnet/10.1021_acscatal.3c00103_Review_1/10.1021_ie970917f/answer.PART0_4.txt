The given literature does not directly discuss the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The document focuses on isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation over Pt/Sn-based catalysts, rather than propane dehydrogenation. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the PDH mechanism or discuss the debate regarding its rate-controlling step based on the information in this document.

However, I can extend the answer based on general knowledge of dehydrogenation reactions:

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) typically consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and dissociates, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is extracted from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propene intermediate.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propene and hydrogen desorb from the catalyst surface, producing gaseous propene and hydrogen.

There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-controlling, catalyst development should focus on improving propane activation. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, efforts should concentrate on facilitating hydrogen removal.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations may differ depending on which step is rate-controlling.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require correct identification of the rate-determining step, affecting predictions of reaction rates and product yields.

4. Process optimization: Understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for optimizing industrial PDH processes and improving overall efficiency.

5. Mechanistic studies: The uncertainty hinders a complete understanding of the reaction mechanism, potentially limiting the development of novel catalysts or process improvements.

Further research, including in-situ spectroscopic studies and advanced computational modeling, is needed to resolve this debate and enhance our understanding of the PDH process.

给定的文献并未直接讨论丙烷脱氢（PDH）的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制。该文档主要关注Pt/Sn基催化剂上的异丁烷脱氢和异丁烯加氢，而非丙烷脱氢。因此，我无法根据该文档中的信息详细解释PDH机制或讨论其速率控制步骤的争议。

然而，我可以基于对脱氢反应的一般认知扩展回答：

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制通常包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面吸附并解离，形成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附丙基物种的β碳上提取一个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯中间体。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯和氢从催化剂表面脱附，产生气态丙烯和氢气。

科学界对于PDH过程中是解离吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤存在持续争议。这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几方面影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率控制步骤，催化剂开发应该专注于改善丙烷的活化。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，则应集中精力于促进氢的去除。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和反应物浓度可能会因速率控制步骤的不同而有所差异。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型需要正确识别速率决定步骤，这会影响对反应速率和产品产率的预测。

4. 工艺优化：了解速率限制步骤对优化工业PDH过程和提高整体效率至关重要。

5. 机理研究：这种不确定性阻碍了对反应机理的完全理解，可能限制了新型催化剂的开发或工艺改进。

需要进一步的研究，包括原位光谱研究和先进的计算模型，以解决这一争议并增进我们对PDH过程的理解。
