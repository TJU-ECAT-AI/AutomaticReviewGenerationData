[1] "As noted above, the combined results from reaction kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below (Cortright et al., 1996):"

[2] "On the basis of the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process (Cortright et al., 1996). A similar conclusion was reached by Lok et al. (1986) in their investigation of isobutane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported Pt/Sn catalysts."

The literature provided does not specifically discuss the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It focuses on isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation over Pt/Sn catalysts. However, we can use this information to infer some insights about PDH.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for alkane dehydrogenation generally involves three steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. β-H extraction to form an adsorbed alkene
3. Desorption of the alkene product

The literature mentions that for isobutane dehydrogenation, the dissociative adsorption step appears to be rate-limiting based on deuterium tracing results. This contradicts the ongoing debate in PDH literature about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, catalysts should be optimized for alkane activation. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the focus should be on facilitating H-abstraction.

2. Reaction conditions: The rate-limiting step influences how temperature and pressure affect the reaction rate.

3. Kinetic modeling: Different rate-limiting steps lead to different rate expressions, affecting how we model and predict PDH performance.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The rate-limiting step provides insight into the energy landscape of the reaction, guiding fundamental research.

The discrepancy between the findings for isobutane dehydrogenation and the ongoing debate in PDH highlights the complexity of these reactions and the need for careful, system-specific studies to determine rate-limiting steps in alkane dehydrogenation processes.

所提供的文献并未具体讨论丙烷脱氢(PDH)的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理。它主要关注Pt/Sn催化剂上的异丁烷脱氢和异丁烯加氢反应。然而，我们可以利用这些信息来推断PDH的一些见解。

烷烃脱氢的Horiuti-Polanyi机理通常包括三个步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. β-H提取形成吸附的烯烃
3. 烯烃产物的脱附

文献提到，对于异丁烷脱氢，基于氘示踪结果，解离吸附步骤似乎是速率限制步骤。这与PDH文献中关于解离吸附或β-H提取是否为速率控制步骤的持续争论相矛盾。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，应该优化催化剂以活化烷烃。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，重点应该放在促进H-抽提上。

2. 反应条件：速率限制步骤影响温度和压力如何影响反应速率。

3. 动力学建模：不同的速率限制步骤导致不同的速率表达式，影响我们如何建模和预测PDH性能。

4. 机理理解：速率限制步骤为反应的能量景观提供了洞察，指导基础研究。

异丁烷脱氢的发现与PDH中持续存在的争论之间的差异突出了这些反应的复杂性，以及需要进行谨慎的、特定系统的研究来确定烷烃脱氢过程中的速率限制步骤。
