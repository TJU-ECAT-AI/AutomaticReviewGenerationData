[1] "As noted above, the combined results from reaction kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below (Cortright et al., 1996)"

[2] "On the basis of the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process (Cortright et al., 1996). A similar conclusion was reached by Lok et al. (1986) in their investigation of isobutane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported Pt/Sn catalysts."

The literature discusses the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for isobutane dehydrogenation rather than propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, we can extend the discussion to PDH as the mechanisms are similar.

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and dissociates, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is removed from the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propene.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propene desorbs from the catalyst surface, releasing the product.

The debate regarding the rate-controlling step in PDH is ongoing. While the literature provided focuses on isobutane dehydrogenation and suggests that dissociative adsorption is the slow step, this conclusion cannot be directly applied to PDH without further evidence.

The uncertainty about the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-controlling, catalysts should be optimized for C-H bond activation. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the focus should be on facilitating hydrogen transfer.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations may differ depending on which step is rate-limiting.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require correct identification of the rate-determining step.

4. Process optimization: Industrial PDH processes may be designed differently based on which step is believed to be rate-limiting.

5. Mechanistic understanding: The nature of the rate-determining step provides insights into the reaction's molecular-level processes.

Given the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis, it's possible that the rate-determining step in PDH may vary depending on specific reaction conditions and catalyst properties. Further research, including isotope labeling studies and detailed kinetic analyses, is necessary to resolve this debate for PDH specifically.

文献讨论的是异丁烷脱氢的Horiuti-Polanyi机理，而非丙烷脱氢(PDH)。然而，我们可以将讨论扩展到PDH，因为这两个机理类似。

丙烷脱氢(PDH)的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷吸附在催化剂表面并解离，形成吸附的丙基和氢。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中移除一个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附，释放产物。

关于PDH中速率控制步骤的争论仍在继续。虽然提供的文献集中于异丁烷脱氢，并暗示解离吸附是慢步骤，但没有进一步的证据，这一结论不能直接应用于PDH。

关于速率控制步骤的不确定性以几种方式影响我们对PDH过程的理解：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率控制步骤，催化剂应该被优化以活化C-H键。如果β-H提取是限速步骤，重点应该放在促进氢转移上。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和反应物浓度可能会根据哪个步骤是限速步骤而有所不同。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型需要正确识别速率决定步骤。

4. 过程优化：工业PDH过程的设计可能会根据认为哪个步骤是限速步骤而有所不同。

5. 机理理解：速率决定步骤的性质为反应的分子水平过程提供了洞察。

鉴于多相催化的复杂性，PDH中的速率决定步骤可能会根据特定的反应条件和催化剂性质而变化。需要进一步的研究，包括同位素标记研究和详细的动力学分析，以专门解决PDH的这一争论。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane molecule adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and dissociates, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is extracted from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propene molecule.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propene molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface, producing gaseous propene.

There is an ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step in PDH. While the literature provided focuses on isobutane dehydrogenation, it suggests that dissociative adsorption is the slow step. However, this conclusion may not directly apply to propane dehydrogenation.

The uncertainty about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is rate-controlling impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-controlling, catalysts should be optimized to facilitate propane adsorption and breaking of C-H bonds. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the focus should be on optimizing the catalyst's ability to abstract hydrogen from adsorbed propyl species.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations may differ depending on which step is rate-controlling.

3. Kinetic modeling: The rate expressions and activation energies used in kinetic models would need to be adjusted based on the rate-determining step.

4. Process optimization: Strategies for improving PDH efficiency and yield would vary depending on which step is rate-limiting.

5. Mechanistic understanding: The uncertainty affects our fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism and the factors that influence the overall reaction rate.

This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of heterogeneous catalytic processes and the need for further research to elucidate the intricacies of the PDH mechanism on different catalyst systems.

关于解离吸附或β-H提取是否为速率控制步骤的不确定性，对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率控制步骤，催化剂应该被优化以促进丙烷吸附和C-H键的断裂。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，重点应该放在优化催化剂从吸附丙基物种中提取氢的能力上。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和反应物浓度可能会因速率控制步骤的不同而有所不同。

3. 动力学建模：动力学模型中使用的速率表达式和活化能需要根据速率决定步骤进行调整。

4. 过程优化：提高PDH效率和产率的策略会因速率限制步骤的不同而有所不同。

5. 机理理解：这种不确定性影响我们对反应机理的基本理解，以及影响整体反应速率的因素。

这一持续的争论突显了多相催化过程的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以阐明不同催化剂系统上PDH机理的复杂性。

The literature provided does not contain information specifically about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The document focuses on isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation over Pt/Sn catalysts, rather than propane dehydrogenation. While it does discuss a four-step Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for isobutane dehydrogenation, it does not provide details on the three-step reverse mechanism for propane, nor does it discuss the debate over the rate-controlling step in PDH. Therefore, I cannot answer this question based on the given literature.

The literature provided does not specifically discuss the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It focuses on isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation over Pt/Sn catalysts. However, we can use this information to infer some insights about PDH.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for alkane dehydrogenation generally involves three steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. β-H extraction to form an adsorbed alkene
3. Desorption of the alkene product

The literature mentions that for isobutane dehydrogenation, the dissociative adsorption step appears to be rate-limiting based on deuterium tracing results. This contradicts the ongoing debate in PDH literature about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, catalysts should be optimized for alkane activation. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the focus should be on facilitating H-abstraction.

2. Reaction conditions: The rate-limiting step influences how temperature and pressure affect the reaction rate.

3. Kinetic modeling: Different rate-limiting steps lead to different rate expressions, affecting how we model and predict PDH performance.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The rate-limiting step provides insight into the energy landscape of the reaction, guiding fundamental research.

The discrepancy between the findings for isobutane dehydrogenation and the ongoing debate in PDH highlights the complexity of these reactions and the need for careful, system-specific studies to determine rate-limiting steps in alkane dehydrogenation processes.

所提供的文献并未具体讨论丙烷脱氢(PDH)的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理。它主要关注Pt/Sn催化剂上的异丁烷脱氢和异丁烯加氢反应。然而，我们可以利用这些信息来推断PDH的一些见解。

烷烃脱氢的Horiuti-Polanyi机理通常包括三个步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. β-H提取形成吸附的烯烃
3. 烯烃产物的脱附

文献提到，对于异丁烷脱氢，基于氘示踪结果，解离吸附步骤似乎是速率限制步骤。这与PDH文献中关于解离吸附或β-H提取是否为速率控制步骤的持续争论相矛盾。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，应该优化催化剂以活化烷烃。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，重点应该放在促进H-抽提上。

2. 反应条件：速率限制步骤影响温度和压力如何影响反应速率。

3. 动力学建模：不同的速率限制步骤导致不同的速率表达式，影响我们如何建模和预测PDH性能。

4. 机理理解：速率限制步骤为反应的能量景观提供了洞察，指导基础研究。

异丁烷脱氢的发现与PDH中持续存在的争论之间的差异突出了这些反应的复杂性，以及需要进行谨慎的、特定系统的研究来确定烷烃脱氢过程中的速率限制步骤。

The given literature does not directly discuss the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The document focuses on isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation over Pt/Sn-based catalysts, rather than propane dehydrogenation. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the PDH mechanism or discuss the debate regarding its rate-controlling step based on the information in this document.

However, I can extend the answer based on general knowledge of dehydrogenation reactions:

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) typically consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and dissociates, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is extracted from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propene intermediate.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propene and hydrogen desorb from the catalyst surface, producing gaseous propene and hydrogen.

There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-controlling, catalyst development should focus on improving propane activation. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, efforts should concentrate on facilitating hydrogen removal.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations may differ depending on which step is rate-controlling.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require correct identification of the rate-determining step, affecting predictions of reaction rates and product yields.

4. Process optimization: Understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for optimizing industrial PDH processes and improving overall efficiency.

5. Mechanistic studies: The uncertainty hinders a complete understanding of the reaction mechanism, potentially limiting the development of novel catalysts or process improvements.

Further research, including in-situ spectroscopic studies and advanced computational modeling, is needed to resolve this debate and enhance our understanding of the PDH process.

给定的文献并未直接讨论丙烷脱氢（PDH）的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制。该文档主要关注Pt/Sn基催化剂上的异丁烷脱氢和异丁烯加氢，而非丙烷脱氢。因此，我无法根据该文档中的信息详细解释PDH机制或讨论其速率控制步骤的争议。

然而，我可以基于对脱氢反应的一般认知扩展回答：

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制通常包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面吸附并解离，形成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附丙基物种的β碳上提取一个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯中间体。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯和氢从催化剂表面脱附，产生气态丙烯和氢气。

科学界对于PDH过程中是解离吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤存在持续争议。这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几方面影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率控制步骤，催化剂开发应该专注于改善丙烷的活化。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，则应集中精力于促进氢的去除。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和反应物浓度可能会因速率控制步骤的不同而有所差异。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型需要正确识别速率决定步骤，这会影响对反应速率和产品产率的预测。

4. 工艺优化：了解速率限制步骤对优化工业PDH过程和提高整体效率至关重要。

5. 机理研究：这种不确定性阻碍了对反应机理的完全理解，可能限制了新型催化剂的开发或工艺改进。

需要进一步的研究，包括原位光谱研究和先进的计算模型，以解决这一争议并增进我们对PDH过程的理解。
