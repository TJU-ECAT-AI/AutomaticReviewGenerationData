[1] "As noted above, the combined results from reaction kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below"

[2] "On the basis of the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process"

[3] "A similar conclusion was reached by Lok et al. (1986) in their investigation of isobutane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported Pt/Sn catalysts."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) involves three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane molecule adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and dissociates, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is extracted from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propene molecule.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propene molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface, producing gaseous propene.

There is an ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step in PDH. While the literature provided focuses on isobutane dehydrogenation, it suggests that dissociative adsorption is the slow step. However, this conclusion may not directly apply to propane dehydrogenation.

The uncertainty about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is rate-controlling impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-controlling, catalysts should be optimized to facilitate propane adsorption and breaking of C-H bonds. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the focus should be on optimizing the catalyst's ability to abstract hydrogen from adsorbed propyl species.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations may differ depending on which step is rate-controlling.

3. Kinetic modeling: The rate expressions and activation energies used in kinetic models would need to be adjusted based on the rate-determining step.

4. Process optimization: Strategies for improving PDH efficiency and yield would vary depending on which step is rate-limiting.

5. Mechanistic understanding: The uncertainty affects our fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism and the factors that influence the overall reaction rate.

This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of heterogeneous catalytic processes and the need for further research to elucidate the intricacies of the PDH mechanism on different catalyst systems.

Horiuti-Polanyi机理描述丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷分子吸附在催化剂表面并解离，形成吸附的丙基和氢。

2. β-H提取：从吸附丙基物种的β-碳上提取一个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯分子。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯分子从催化剂表面脱附，生成气态丙烯。

关于PDH反应中的速率控制步骤，目前仍存在争议。虽然提供的文献关注异丁烷脱氢，并暗示解离吸附是慢步骤，但这一结论可能不能直接应用于丙烷脱氢。

关于解离吸附或β-H提取是否为速率控制步骤的不确定性，对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率控制步骤，催化剂应该被优化以促进丙烷吸附和C-H键的断裂。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，重点应该放在优化催化剂从吸附丙基物种中提取氢的能力上。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和反应物浓度可能会因速率控制步骤的不同而有所不同。

3. 动力学建模：动力学模型中使用的速率表达式和活化能需要根据速率决定步骤进行调整。

4. 过程优化：提高PDH效率和产率的策略会因速率限制步骤的不同而有所不同。

5. 机理理解：这种不确定性影响我们对反应机理的基本理解，以及影响整体反应速率的因素。

这一持续的争论突显了多相催化过程的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以阐明不同催化剂系统上PDH机理的复杂性。
