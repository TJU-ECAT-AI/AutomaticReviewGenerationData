[1] "The reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2."

[2] "However, whether the dissociative adsorption process or the extraction of the β-H is the rate-controlling step of PDH process remains to be confirmed."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is divided into three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: The alkane (propane) is adsorbed onto the catalyst surface, and one hydrogen atom is eliminated.

2. β-H extraction: The β-hydrogen is extracted from the adsorbed species, leading to the formation of hydrogen gas (H2) and a carbon-carbon double bond.

3. Desorption: The newly formed alkene (propylene) and hydrogen gas desorb from the catalyst surface.

There is ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. Some researchers argue that the dissociative adsorption is the rate-limiting step, while others believe it is the β-H extraction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Kinetics modeling: Without a clear understanding of the rate-controlling step, it becomes challenging to develop accurate kinetic models for the PDH process.

2. Catalyst design: The ambiguity in the rate-controlling step makes it difficult to optimize catalyst design, as different steps may require different catalytic properties for enhancement.

3. Process optimization: Operating conditions and reactor designs may need to be adjusted differently depending on which step is rate-limiting, making process optimization more complex.

4. Mechanistic studies: The lack of consensus on the rate-controlling step hinders a complete understanding of the reaction mechanism, potentially limiting the development of more efficient catalysts and processes.

5. Scale-up challenges: When scaling up the PDH process for industrial applications, the uncertainty in the rate-controlling step may lead to unexpected performance issues or inefficiencies.

This ongoing debate highlights the need for further research and advanced characterization techniques to definitively identify the rate-controlling step in the PDH process, which would significantly improve our ability to optimize and advance this important industrial reaction.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理描述了丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程，分为三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：烷烃（丙烷）被吸附到催化剂表面，并去除一个氢原子。

2. β-H提取：从吸附物种中提取β-氢，形成氢气（H2）和碳-碳双键。

3. 脱附：新形成的烯烃（丙烯）和氢气从催化剂表面脱附。

科学界对PDH过程中哪一步是速率控制步骤存在争议。一些研究人员认为解离吸附是限速步骤，而另一些人则认为是β-H提取。这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程产生了几个方面的影响：

1. 动力学建模：没有明确了解速率控制步骤，就很难为PDH过程开发准确的动力学模型。

2. 催化剂设计：速率控制步骤的模糊性使催化剂设计的优化变得困难，因为不同的步骤可能需要不同的催化性能来增强。

3. 工艺优化：操作条件和反应器设计可能需要根据限速步骤的不同而进行不同的调整，使工艺优化变得更加复杂。

4. 机理研究：对速率控制步骤缺乏共识阻碍了对反应机理的完整理解，可能限制了更高效催化剂和工艺的开发。

5. 放大挑战：在将PDH过程扩大到工业应用时，速率控制步骤的不确定性可能导致意外的性能问题或效率低下。

这一持续的争论强调了需要进行进一步研究和使用先进的表征技术，以明确识别PDH过程中的速率控制步骤，这将显著提高我们优化和推进这一重要工业反应的能力。
