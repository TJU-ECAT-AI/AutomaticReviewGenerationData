          [1] "The reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2."

          [2] "However, whether the dissociative adsorption process or the extraction of the β-H is the rate-controlling step of PDH process remains to be confirmed."

          The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

          1. Dissociative adsorption: The alkane (propane) is adsorbed onto the catalyst surface, and one hydrogen atom is eliminated.

          2. β-H extraction: The β-hydrogen is extracted from the adsorbed species, forming H2 and a carbon-carbon double bond.

          3. Desorption: The newly formed alkene (propylene) and H2 desorb from the catalyst surface.

          There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. Some researchers argue that the dissociative adsorption process is the rate-limiting step, while others suggest that the β-H extraction is the key determinant of the reaction rate.

          This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

          1. Catalyst design: Without knowing the rate-controlling step, it becomes challenging to optimize catalysts specifically for enhancing the slowest step of the reaction.

          2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and other reaction conditions may vary depending on which step is rate-limiting.

          3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models are crucial for process design and optimization, but the ambiguity in the rate-controlling step makes it difficult to develop precise models.

          4. Mechanistic studies: The lack of consensus on the rate-determining step hinders our ability to fully elucidate the reaction mechanism and identify potential intermediates or transition states.

          5. Process improvements: Without a clear understanding of the rate-limiting step, it becomes more challenging to develop strategies for improving reaction rates and overall process efficiency.

          This ongoing debate highlights the need for further research and advanced characterization techniques to definitively determine the rate-controlling step in the PDH process, which would greatly enhance our ability to optimize and improve this important industrial reaction.

          逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理描述了丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程，包括三个主要步骤：

          1. 解离吸附：烷烃（丙烷）被吸附到催化剂表面，并释放一个氢原子。

          2. β-H提取：从吸附物种中提取β-氢，形成H2和碳-碳双键。

          3. 脱附：新形成的烯烃（丙烯）和H2从催化剂表面脱附。

          科学界对于反应的速率控制步骤仍存在争议。一些研究者认为解离吸附过程是速率限制步骤，而其他人则认为β-H提取是反应速率的关键决定因素。

          这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程产生了以下影响：

          1. 催化剂设计：不知道速率控制步骤，就难以针对反应最慢步骤优化催化剂。

          2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和其他反应条件可能会根据速率限制步骤的不同而变化。

          3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型对过程设计和优化至关重要，但速率控制步骤的模糊性使得开发精确模型变得困难。

          4. 机理研究：对速率决定步骤缺乏共识，阻碍了我们充分阐明反应机理并识别潜在中间体或过渡态的能力。

          5. 过程改进：如果不清楚了解速率限制步骤，就更难制定提高反应速率和整体过程效率的策略。

          这一持续的争议突显了需要进一步研究和先进表征技术，以明确确定PDH过程中的速率控制步骤。这将大大提高我们优化和改进这一重要工业反应的能力。
