[1] "The reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2."

[2] "However, whether the dissociative adsorption process or the extraction of the β-H is the rate-controlling step of PDH process remains to be confirmed."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: The alkane (propane) adsorbs onto the catalyst surface, and one hydrogen atom is eliminated.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is extracted from the β-carbon of the adsorbed species, leading to the formation of hydrogen gas (H2) and a carbon-carbon double bond.

3. Desorption: The newly formed alkene (propylene) and hydrogen gas desorb from the catalyst surface.

There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. Some researchers argue that the dissociative adsorption process is the rate-limiting step, while others believe it is the β-H extraction step. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: Without knowing which step is rate-limiting, it is challenging to optimize catalyst properties to specifically enhance the slowest step.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and other reaction conditions may vary depending on which step is rate-controlling.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models of the PDH process require correct identification of the rate-limiting step to properly describe reaction rates and predict catalyst performance.

4. Mechanistic studies: The focus of mechanistic investigations may need to be adjusted based on which step is determined to be rate-controlling.

5. Process optimization: Industrial PDH processes could potentially be improved if the rate-limiting step were definitively identified and targeted for enhancement.

This ongoing uncertainty highlights the need for further research to elucidate the detailed kinetics of the PDH process and resolve the debate surrounding the rate-controlling step.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理描述丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：烷烃（丙烷）吸附在催化剂表面，并消除一个氢原子。

2. β-H提取：从吸附物种的β碳上提取一个氢原子，导致形成氢气（H2）和碳-碳双键。

3. 脱附：新形成的烯烃（丙烯）和氢气从催化剂表面脱附。

科学界对PDH过程中哪一步是速率控制步骤存在争议。一些研究人员认为解离吸附过程是速率限制步骤，而其他人则认为是β-H提取步骤。这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：不知道哪一步是速率限制步骤，就难以优化催化剂性能以专门增强最慢的步骤。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和其他反应条件可能会根据哪一步是速率控制步骤而有所不同。

3. 动力学建模：PDH过程的准确动力学模型需要正确识别速率限制步骤，以正确描述反应速率并预测催化剂性能。

4. 机理研究：机理研究的重点可能需要根据确定的速率控制步骤进行调整。

5. 工艺优化：如果能够明确识别速率限制步骤并针对性地进行改进，工业PDH过程可能会得到潜在的改善。

这种持续的不确定性突显了需要进行进一步研究以阐明PDH过程的详细动力学，并解决围绕速率控制步骤的争议。
