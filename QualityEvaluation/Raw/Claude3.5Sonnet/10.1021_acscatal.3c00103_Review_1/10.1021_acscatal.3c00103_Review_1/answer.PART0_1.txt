[1] "The reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2."

[2] "However, whether the dissociative adsorption process or the extraction of the β-H is the rate-controlling step of PDH process remains to be confirmed."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a widely accepted model that describes the kinetics of the process in three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: The alkane (propane) adsorbs onto the catalyst surface, and one hydrogen atom is eliminated.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is extracted from the β-carbon of the adsorbed species, forming H2 and creating a carbon-carbon double bond.

3. Desorption: The newly formed alkene (propylene) and H2 desorb from the catalyst surface.

Despite the widespread acceptance of this mechanism, there is ongoing debate about which step is the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. Some researchers argue that the dissociative adsorption is the rate-limiting step, while others believe it is the β-H extraction.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: Without knowing the rate-controlling step, it's challenging to optimize catalysts specifically for enhancing that step.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and other reaction conditions may vary depending on which step is rate-limiting.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models of the PDH process require correct identification of the rate-controlling step.

4. Process optimization: Industrial-scale PDH processes could be more efficiently designed and operated if the rate-controlling step were definitively known.

5. Mechanistic studies: The uncertainty hinders a complete understanding of the reaction mechanism, potentially impacting related research in catalysis and surface chemistry.

This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and emphasizes the need for further research to conclusively determine the rate-controlling step, which would significantly advance our understanding and optimization of this important industrial reaction.

反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制是一种广泛接受的模型，用于描述丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程的动力学，主要分为三个步骤：

1. 解离吸附：烷烃（丙烷）吸附在催化剂表面，并消除一个氢原子。

2. β-H提取：从吸附物种的β碳上提取一个氢原子，形成H2并创建碳-碳双键。

3. 脱附：新形成的烯烃（丙烯）和H2从催化剂表面脱附。

尽管这个机制被广泛接受，但关于PDH过程中哪个步骤是速率控制步骤仍存在争议。一些研究者认为解离吸附是速率限制步骤，而其他人则认为是β-H提取。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程产生了以下影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果不知道速率控制步骤，就难以针对性地优化催化剂以增强该步骤。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和其他反应条件可能会根据哪个步骤是速率限制步骤而变化。

3. 动力学建模：PDH过程的准确动力学模型需要正确识别速率控制步骤。

4. 过程优化：如果能确定速率控制步骤，工业规模的PDH过程可以更有效地设计和运行。

5. 机理研究：这种不确定性阻碍了对反应机理的完全理解，可能会影响催化和表面化学相关研究。

这个持续的争论突显了PDH过程的复杂性，并强调了需要进一步研究以确定速率控制步骤的必要性。这将显著推进我们对这一重要工业反应的理解和优化。
