[1] "The reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2."

[2] "However, whether the dissociative adsorption process or the extraction of the β-H is the rate-controlling step of PDH process remains to be confirmed."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: The alkane (propane) is adsorbed onto the catalyst surface, and one hydrogen atom is eliminated.

2. β-H extraction: The β-hydrogen is extracted from the adsorbed species, resulting in the formation of hydrogen gas (H2) and a carbon-carbon double bond.

3. Desorption: The newly formed alkene (propylene) and hydrogen gas desorb from the catalyst surface.

There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-controlling step in the PDH process. Some researchers argue that the dissociative adsorption is the rate-limiting step, while others believe it is the β-H extraction. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Kinetic modeling: Without a clear understanding of the rate-controlling step, it becomes challenging to develop accurate kinetic models for the PDH reaction.

2. Catalyst design: The uncertainty makes it difficult to optimize catalyst design, as different rate-controlling steps may require different catalyst properties for improved performance.

3. Process optimization: Operating conditions and reactor designs may need to be adjusted depending on which step is rate-limiting, making process optimization more complex.

4. Mechanistic studies: The lack of consensus hinders the development of a complete mechanistic understanding of the PDH process, which is crucial for further improvements in catalyst and process design.

5. Reaction engineering: The ambiguity in the rate-controlling step affects the development of more efficient reactors and process intensification strategies.

This ongoing debate highlights the need for further research and advanced characterization techniques to elucidate the true rate-controlling step in the PDH process, which would significantly enhance our ability to improve catalyst performance and overall process efficiency.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理描述丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：烷烃（丙烷）被吸附在催化剂表面，并消除一个氢原子。

2. β-H提取：从吸附物种中提取β-氢，形成氢气（H2）和碳-碳双键。

3. 脱附：新形成的烯烃（丙烯）和氢气从催化剂表面脱附。

科学界对PDH过程中哪个步骤是速率控制步骤存在争议。一些研究人员认为解离吸附是速率限制步骤，而另一些人则认为是β-H提取。这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程产生了以下影响：

1. 动力学建模：没有明确了解速率控制步骤，就难以为PDH反应开发准确的动力学模型。

2. 催化剂设计：这种不确定性使得优化催化剂设计变得困难，因为不同的速率控制步骤可能需要不同的催化剂性质来提高性能。

3. 过程优化：根据哪个步骤是速率限制步骤，可能需要调整操作条件和反应器设计，使过程优化变得更加复杂。

4. 机理研究：缺乏共识阻碍了对PDH过程完整机理理解的发展，而这对进一步改进催化剂和过程设计至关重要。

5. 反应工程：速率控制步骤的模糊性影响了更高效反应器的开发和过程强化策略。

这一持续的争论突显了需要进一步研究和先进表征技术来阐明PDH过程中真正的速率控制步骤，这将显著提高我们改善催化剂性能和整体过程效率的能力。
