[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane and the hydrogenation of propylene were kinetically investigated over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts."
[2] "It was concluded that the rate determining step of the reaction was (C3H8)a  (C3H6)a + (H2)a."

The provided literature does not contain detailed information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or its three steps. The document only mentions a kinetic investigation of propane dehydrogenation over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts and states that the rate-determining step involves the conversion of adsorbed propane to adsorbed propylene and hydrogen. 

The literature does not discuss the ongoing debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. It also does not provide information on how this uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process.

Given the limited information in the provided text, a comprehensive answer to the question cannot be formulated based solely on this literature. To properly address the question, additional sources discussing the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, its steps, and the current debates in the field would be necessary.

提供的文献并不包含关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制或其三个步骤的详细信息。该文档仅提到了在氧化铬-氧化铝-氧化钾催化剂上对丙烷脱氢的动力学研究，并指出反应的决速步骤涉及吸附丙烷转化为吸附丙烯和氢气。

文献没有讨论关于解离吸附或β-H提取是否为速率控制步骤的持续争论。它也没有提供这种不确定性如何影响我们对PDH过程理解的信息。

鉴于提供的文本中信息有限，仅基于这份文献无法形成对该问题的全面回答。要正确回答这个问题，需要额外的资料来讨论反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制、其步骤以及该领域目前的争论。
