The given literature does not provide sufficient information to fully explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or discuss the ongoing debate about the rate-controlling step. The document only mentions a kinetic investigation of propane dehydrogenation over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts and states a conclusion about the rate-determining step.

The literature does not detail the three steps of the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption) or discuss the debate regarding whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. 

The document concludes that the rate-determining step of the reaction was (C3H8)a  (C3H6)a + (H2)a, which appears to represent the overall dehydrogenation reaction rather than a specific mechanistic step. This information is insufficient to address the uncertainty in the rate-controlling step or its impact on our understanding of the PDH process.

Given the limited information provided in the literature, a comprehensive answer to the question cannot be formulated based solely on this document.

给定的文献没有提供足够的信息来全面解释丙烷脱氢（PDH）的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制，或讨论关于速率控制步骤的持续争论。该文档仅提到了在氧化铬-氧化铝-氧化钾催化剂上对丙烷脱氢的动力学研究，并陈述了关于速率决定步骤的结论。

文献没有详细说明反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制的三个步骤（解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附），也没有讨论解离吸附过程或β-H提取是否为速率控制步骤的争论。

文档得出结论，反应的速率决定步骤是(C3H8)a  (C3H6)a + (H2)a，这似乎代表了整体脱氢反应，而不是特定的机制步骤。这些信息不足以解决速率控制步骤的不确定性或其对我们理解PDH过程的影响。

鉴于文献提供的信息有限，仅基于这份文档无法形成对该问题的全面回答。
