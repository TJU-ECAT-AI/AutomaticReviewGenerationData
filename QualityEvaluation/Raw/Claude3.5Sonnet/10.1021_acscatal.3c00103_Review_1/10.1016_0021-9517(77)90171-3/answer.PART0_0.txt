[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane and the hydrogenation of propylene were kinetically investigated over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts."

[2] "It was concluded that the rate determining step of the reaction was (C3H8)a  (C3H6)a + (H2)a."

The provided literature does not contain detailed information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or its three steps. The document only mentions a kinetic investigation of propane dehydrogenation over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts and states that the rate-determining step involves the conversion of adsorbed propane to adsorbed propylene and hydrogen. It does not discuss the ongoing debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step.

Given the limited information in the provided literature, it is not possible to fully explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, detail its three steps, or critically discuss the debate regarding the rate-controlling step. The document does not provide sufficient context to address how this uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process.

所提供的文献中没有关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制或其三个步骤的详细信息。该文档仅提到了在氧化铬-氧化铝-氧化钾催化剂上对丙烷脱氢进行的动力学研究，并指出反应的速率决定步骤涉及吸附丙烷转化为吸附丙烯和氢气。文档没有讨论关于解离吸附或β-H提取哪个是速率控制步骤的持续争论。

鉴于所提供文献中的有限信息，无法充分解释反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制，详细说明其三个步骤，或批判性地讨论关于速率控制步骤的争论。该文档没有提供足够的背景来解释这种不确定性如何影响我们对PDH过程的理解。
