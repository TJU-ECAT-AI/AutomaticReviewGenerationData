The provided literature does not contain detailed information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or its three steps. The document only mentions a kinetic investigation of propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts. It states that the rate-determining step of the reaction was (C3H8)a  (C3H6)a + (H2)a, which represents the overall dehydrogenation reaction of propane to propylene and hydrogen. However, this information is insufficient to explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or discuss the debate regarding the rate-controlling step.

The literature does not provide any information about the dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, or desorption steps. It also does not mention any ongoing debate about which step might be rate-controlling. Therefore, based solely on the given information, it is not possible to critically discuss the uncertainty surrounding the rate-controlling step or its impact on our understanding of the PDH process.

提供的文献中没有关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制或其三个步骤的详细信息。该文档仅提到了在铬-氧化铝-氧化钾催化剂上对丙烷脱氢和丙烯加氢进行的动力学研究。它指出反应的速率决定步骤是(C3H8)a  (C3H6)a + (H2)a，这代表了丙烷脱氢成丙烯和氢的整体反应。然而，这些信息不足以解释反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制或讨论关于速率控制步骤的争论。

文献中没有提供任何关于解离吸附、β-H提取或脱附步骤的信息。它也没有提到任何关于哪个步骤可能是速率控制步骤的持续争论。因此，仅基于给定的信息，无法对速率控制步骤的不确定性或其对我们理解PDH过程的影响进行批判性讨论。
