[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane and the hydrogenation of propylene were kinetically investigated over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts."
[2] "It was concluded that the rate determining step of the reaction was (C3H8)a  (C3H6)a + (H2)a."

The provided literature does not contain detailed information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or its three steps. The document only mentions a kinetic investigation of propane dehydrogenation over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts. It concludes that the rate-determining step involves the conversion of adsorbed propane to adsorbed propylene and hydrogen, but does not discuss the specific mechanism or debate about which step controls the rate.

Without more specific information from the text, it is not possible to explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, detail its steps, or discuss the debate about the rate-controlling step. The literature does not provide sufficient context to address how this uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process.

提供的文献中没有关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制及其三个步骤的详细信息。文档仅提到了在氧化铬-氧化铝-氧化钾催化剂上对丙烷脱氢进行的动力学研究。它得出结论，反应的速率决定步骤涉及吸附丙烷转化为吸附丙烯和氢气，但没有讨论具体机制或关于哪个步骤控制速率的争论。

由于文本缺乏更具体的信息，无法解释反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制，详细说明其步骤，或讨论关于速率控制步骤的争论。文献没有提供足够的背景来解释这种不确定性如何影响我们对PDH过程的理解。
