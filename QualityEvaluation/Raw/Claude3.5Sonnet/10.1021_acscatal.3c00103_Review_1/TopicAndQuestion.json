    "QuestionEnglish": "Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?",
    "QuestionChinese": "解释丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的逆向Horiuti-Polanyi机制，详细说明其三个步骤（解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附），并批判性地讨论关于解离吸附过程或β-H提取是否为该反应的速率控制步骤的持续争论。这种不确定性如何影响我们对PDH过程的理解？"
