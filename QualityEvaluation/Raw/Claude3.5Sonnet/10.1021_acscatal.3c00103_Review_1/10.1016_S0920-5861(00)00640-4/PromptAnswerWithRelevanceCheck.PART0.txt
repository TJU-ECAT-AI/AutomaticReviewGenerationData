Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation or details about its steps. The document focuses on coke formation during propane dehydrogenation rather than the dehydrogenation mechanism itself. There is no discussion of dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, or the debate about which step is rate-controlling. As such, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided literature.

所提供的文献没有包含关于丙烷脱氢的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制或其步骤的信息。该文档主要关注丙烷脱氢过程中的积炭形成,而不是脱氢机制本身。文中没有讨论解离吸附、β-H提取,或关于哪个步骤是速率控制步骤的争论。因此,仅凭所提供的文献无法充分回答这个问题。

提供的文献中没有关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制或其具体步骤的信息。该文档主要集中在丙烷脱氢过程中的结焦形成，而不是脱氢机制本身。它没有讨论解离吸附、β-H提取或脱附步骤，也没有提到关于速率控制步骤的任何争议。这篇文献缺乏回答这个问题或讨论其对我们理解PDH过程的影响所需的必要信息。
