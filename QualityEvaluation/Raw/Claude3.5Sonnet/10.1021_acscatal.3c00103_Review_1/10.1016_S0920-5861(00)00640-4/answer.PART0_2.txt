The provided literature does not contain information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or discuss its specific steps. The document focuses on coke formation during propane dehydrogenation rather than the dehydrogenation mechanism itself. It does not mention the dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, or desorption steps, nor does it discuss any debate about the rate-controlling step. As such, the question cannot be answered based on the given text.

提供的文献不包含关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制的信息,也没有讨论其具体步骤。该文档主要关注丙烷脱氢过程中的积炭形成,而不是脱氢机制本身。它没有提到解离吸附、β-H提取或脱附步骤,也没有讨论关于速率控制步骤的任何争论。因此,无法根据给定的文本回答这个问题。
