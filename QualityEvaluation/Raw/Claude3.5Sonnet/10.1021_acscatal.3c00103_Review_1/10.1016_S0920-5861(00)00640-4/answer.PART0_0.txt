<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation or details about its steps. The document focuses on coke formation during propane dehydrogenation rather than the dehydrogenation mechanism itself. There is no discussion of dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, or the debate about which step is rate-controlling. As such, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided literature.

所提供的文献没有包含关于丙烷脱氢的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制或其步骤的信息。该文档主要关注丙烷脱氢过程中的积炭形成,而不是脱氢机制本身。文中没有讨论解离吸附、β-H提取,或关于哪个步骤是速率控制步骤的争论。因此,仅凭所提供的文献无法充分回答这个问题。
