The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and breaks into propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is removed from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propene intermediate.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propene desorbs from the catalyst surface, releasing the product.

There is ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which step is rate-controlling. Some researchers argue that the dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, while others suggest that β-H extraction is the slowest step. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, catalysts should be designed to facilitate propane adsorption. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the focus should be on optimizing the catalyst's ability to remove hydrogen.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature and pressure conditions may differ depending on which step is rate-controlling.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require correct identification of the rate-limiting step.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and the need for further research to fully elucidate the reaction mechanism.

5. Process optimization: Industrial PDH processes could be more effectively optimized with a clear understanding of the rate-controlling step.

This ongoing uncertainty emphasizes the need for advanced in-situ characterization techniques and detailed kinetic studies to resolve the debate and improve our fundamental understanding of the PDH process.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷吸附在催化剂表面并分解成丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种的β碳上移除一个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯中间体。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附，释放产物。

科学界对哪一步是速率控制步骤存在争议。一些研究人员认为解离吸附是速率限制步骤，而另一些人则认为β-H提取是最慢的步骤。这种不确定性以几种方式影响我们对PDH过程的理解：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，应设计催化剂以促进丙烷吸附。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，重点应放在优化催化剂去除氢的能力上。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度和压力条件可能会因速率控制步骤的不同而有所不同。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型需要正确识别速率限制步骤。

4. 机理理解：这场争论突显了PDH过程的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以充分阐明反应机理。

5. 过程优化：如果清楚地了解速率控制步骤，工业PDH过程可以更有效地优化。

这种持续的不确定性强调了需要先进的原位表征技术和详细的动力学研究来解决争议，并提高我们对PDH过程的基本理解。
