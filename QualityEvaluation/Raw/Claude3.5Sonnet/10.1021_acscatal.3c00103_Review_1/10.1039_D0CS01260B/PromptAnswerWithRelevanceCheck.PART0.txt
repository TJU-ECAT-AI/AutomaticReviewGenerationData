[1] "As represented by Horiuti and Polanyi in 1934, LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics is used to describe the mechanism of Pt-catalyzed DH reactions that follow dissociative adsorption of alkane, elimination of the second hydrogen atom and recombinative formation of hydrogen molecules, and desorption of olefin and hydrogen."

[2] "According to most experimental and theoretical calculation results, either the first CH bond cleavage for the adsorbed propane or the second CH bond cleavage is identified as the rate-limiting step."

[3] "The CH cleavage of propane may lead to the formation of 1-, or 2-propyl intermediate in the Pt(111)-catalyzed PDH reaction, whereas the 1-propyl intermediate may be observed in the PDH reaction over PtSn alloy with a down-shifted d-band center relative to pure Pt."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and dissociates, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A second hydrogen atom is eliminated from the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propylene intermediate.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene and hydrogen molecules desorb from the catalyst surface as products.

There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. Some experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the first C-H bond cleavage (dissociative adsorption) is rate-limiting, while others indicate that the second C-H bond cleavage (β-H extraction) is the rate-determining step.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, catalyst development should focus on improving the initial C-H bond activation. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, efforts should be directed towards facilitating the second hydrogen removal.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal reaction conditions may vary depending on which step is rate-controlling, affecting parameters such as temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require correct identification of the rate-determining step, which is crucial for predicting reactor performance and optimizing process conditions.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The uncertainty hinders a complete understanding of the reaction mechanism, potentially leading to conflicting interpretations of experimental data.

5. Catalyst deactivation: The nature of the rate-limiting step can influence the types of intermediates that accumulate on the catalyst surface, affecting coking and other deactivation processes.

This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and emphasizes the need for further research to elucidate the precise reaction mechanism and rate-determining step. Advanced in-situ characterization techniques and more sophisticated theoretical calculations may help resolve this uncertainty in the future.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理描述丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应包含三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面吸附并解离，形成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中脱除第二个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯中间体。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯和氢分子作为产物从催化剂表面脱附。

关于解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是该反应的速率控制步骤，目前仍存在争议。一些实验和理论研究表明，第一个C-H键断裂（解离吸附）是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则指出第二个C-H键断裂（β-H提取）是速率决定步骤。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程产生了以下影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，催化剂开发应该侧重于改善初始C-H键活化。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，则应该将努力集中在促进第二个氢的移除上。

2. 反应条件：最佳反应条件可能因速率控制步骤的不同而变化，影响温度、压力和反应物浓度等参数。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型需要正确识别速率决定步骤，这对预测反应器性能和优化工艺条件至关重要。

4. 机理理解：这种不确定性阻碍了对反应机理的完整理解，可能导致对实验数据的解释产生矛盾。

5. 催化剂失活：速率限制步骤的性质可能影响积累在催化剂表面的中间体类型，进而影响积碳和其他失活过程。

这一持续的争论突显了PDH过程的复杂性，并强调了需要进一步研究以阐明确切的反应机理和速率决定步骤。先进的原位表征技术和更复杂的理论计算可能有助于在未来解决这一不确定性。

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface and break apart, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is removed from the adsorbed propyl species, creating an adsorbed propylene intermediate.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene and hydrogen desorb from the catalyst surface as products.

There is ongoing debate about whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. Some experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the first C-H bond cleavage (during dissociative adsorption) is rate-limiting, while others indicate that the second C-H bond cleavage (β-H extraction) is the slowest step.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, catalysts should be optimized for propane activation. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the focus should be on facilitating hydrogen removal.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and gas composition may differ depending on which step is rate-controlling.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require correct identification of the rate-determining step to predict reaction rates and selectivity.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The nature of the rate-limiting step provides insight into the reaction pathway and transition states involved.

5. Catalyst deactivation: The rate-determining step can influence the types of intermediates that accumulate on the catalyst surface, affecting coking and deactivation mechanisms.

This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and the need for further research to fully elucidate the reaction mechanism. Advanced in-situ characterization techniques and computational studies may help resolve this uncertainty and lead to more efficient catalyst designs and process optimizations.
