[1] "As represented by Horiuti and Polanyi in 1934, LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics is used to describe the mechanism of Pt-catalyzed DH reactions that follow dissociative adsorption of alkane, elimination of the second hydrogen atom and recombinative formation of hydrogen molecules, and desorption of olefin and hydrogen."

[2] "According to most experimental and theoretical calculation results, either the first CH bond cleavage for the adsorbed propane or the second CH bond cleavage is identified as the rate-limiting step."

[3] "The CH cleavage of propane may lead to the formation of 1-, or 2-propyl intermediate in the Pt(111)-catalyzed PDH reaction, whereas the 1-propyl intermediate may be observed in the PDH reaction over PtSn alloy with a down-shifted d-band center relative to pure Pt."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface and dissociate, forming adsorbed propyl species and hydrogen atoms.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is extracted from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propylene intermediate.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene and hydrogen desorb from the catalyst surface, completing the PDH process.

There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction. Some experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the first C-H bond cleavage (dissociative adsorption) is rate-limiting, while others indicate that the second C-H bond cleavage (β-H extraction) is the slow step.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, catalyst design should focus on improving the initial C-H bond activation. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, efforts should be directed towards facilitating the second hydrogen removal.

2. Reaction conditions: The rate-controlling step may influence the optimal reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, for maximizing propylene yield.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models depend on correctly identifying the rate-limiting step, which affects predictions of reaction rates and selectivity.

4. Promoter effects: Understanding which step is rate-limiting helps explain how promoters (e.g., Sn in Pt-Sn catalysts) enhance catalytic performance.

5. Mechanistic studies: The uncertainty complicates efforts to elucidate the complete reaction mechanism and intermediate species involved.

6. Catalyst characterization: Identifying the rate-limiting step guides the focus of in-situ and operando spectroscopic studies to observe relevant surface species and transitions.

This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and the need for further research to fully understand the reaction mechanism and develop more efficient catalysts.

Horiuti-Polanyi机理逆反应对丙烷脱氢（PDH）的描述包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷分子吸附在催化剂表面并解离，形成吸附的丙基物种和氢原子。

2. β-H提取：从吸附丙基物种的β-碳上提取一个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯中间体。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯和氢从催化剂表面脱附，完成PDH过程。

关于PDH反应中是解离吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤，目前仍存在争议。一些实验和理论研究表明，第一个C-H键断裂（解离吸附）是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则指出第二个C-H键断裂（β-H提取）是慢步骤。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，催化剂设计应该集中于改善初始C-H键活化。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，则应该致力于促进第二个氢的去除。

2. 反应条件：速率控制步骤可能影响最佳反应条件，如温度和压力，以最大化丙烯产率。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型取决于正确识别速率限制步骤，这影响反应速率和选择性的预测。

4. 助剂效应：理解哪一步是速率限制步骤有助于解释助剂（如Pt-Sn催化剂中的Sn）如何增强催化性能。

5. 机理研究：这种不确定性使得阐明完整反应机理和涉及的中间物种变得复杂。

6. 催化剂表征：识别速率限制步骤可以指导原位和操作中光谱研究的重点，以观察相关的表面物种和转变。

这一持续的争论凸显了PDH过程的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以充分理解反应机理和开发更高效的催化剂。
