[1] "As represented by Horiuti and Polanyi in 1934, LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics is used to describe the mechanism of Pt-catalyzed DH reactions that follow dissociative adsorption of alkane, elimination of the second hydrogen atom and recombinative formation of hydrogen molecules, and desorption of olefin and hydrogen."

[2] "According to most experimental and theoretical calculation results, either the first CH bond cleavage for the adsorbed propane or the second CH bond cleavage is identified as the rate-limiting step."

[3] "The CH cleavage of propane may lead to the formation of 1-, or 2-propyl intermediate in the Pt(111)-catalyzed PDH reaction, whereas the 1-propyl intermediate may be observed in the PDH reaction over PtSn alloy with a down-shifted d-band center relative to pure Pt."

[4] "After the cleavage of the second CH bond, the olefin intermediate adsorbs on the Pt catalysts with π- or di-σ-type binding depending on the catalyst surface property and coverage degree as well as the conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and composition of co-fed gases)"

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface and break apart, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is removed from the adsorbed propyl species, creating an adsorbed propylene intermediate.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene and hydrogen desorb from the catalyst surface as products.

There is ongoing debate about whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. Some experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the first C-H bond cleavage (during dissociative adsorption) is rate-limiting, while others indicate that the second C-H bond cleavage (β-H extraction) is the slowest step.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, catalysts should be optimized for propane activation. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the focus should be on facilitating hydrogen removal.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and gas composition may differ depending on which step is rate-controlling.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require correct identification of the rate-determining step to predict reaction rates and selectivity.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The nature of the rate-limiting step provides insight into the reaction pathway and transition states involved.

5. Catalyst deactivation: The rate-determining step can influence the types of intermediates that accumulate on the catalyst surface, affecting coking and deactivation mechanisms.

This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and the need for further research to fully elucidate the reaction mechanism. Advanced in-situ characterization techniques and computational studies may help resolve this uncertainty and lead to more efficient catalyst designs and process optimizations.

Horiuti-Polanyi逆机制用于描述丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应，包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷分子吸附在催化剂表面并分解，形成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中移除一个氢原子，创建吸附的丙烯中间体。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯和氢从催化剂表面脱附成为产物。

关于解离吸附还是β-H提取是PDH反应的速率控制步骤，目前仍存在争议。一些实验和理论研究表明，第一个C-H键断裂（在解离吸附过程中）是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则指出第二个C-H键断裂（β-H提取）是最慢的步骤。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，催化剂应该针对丙烷活化进行优化。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，重点应该放在促进氢移除上。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和气体组成可能会因速率控制步骤的不同而有所差异。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型需要正确识别速率决定步骤，以预测反应速率和选择性。

4. 机理理解：速率限制步骤的性质为理解反应路径和涉及的过渡态提供了洞察。

5. 催化剂失活：速率决定步骤可能影响积累在催化剂表面的中间体类型，从而影响结焦和失活机制。

这个持续的争论突显了PDH过程的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以充分阐明反应机理。先进的原位表征技术和计算研究可能有助于解决这种不确定性，并导致更高效的催化剂设计和过程优化。
