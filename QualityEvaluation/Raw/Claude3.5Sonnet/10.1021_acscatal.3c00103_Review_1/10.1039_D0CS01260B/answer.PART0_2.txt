[1] "As represented by Horiuti and Polanyi in 1934, LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics is used to describe the mechanism of Pt-catalyzed DH reactions that follow dissociative adsorption of alkane, elimination of the second hydrogen atom and recombinative formation of hydrogen molecules, and desorption of olefin and hydrogen."

[2] "According to most experimental and theoretical calculation results, either the first CH bond cleavage for the adsorbed propane or the second CH bond cleavage is identified as the rate-limiting step."

[3] "The CH cleavage of propane may lead to the formation of 1-, or 2-propyl intermediate in the Pt(111)-catalyzed PDH reaction, whereas the 1-propyl intermediate may be observed in the PDH reaction over PtSn alloy with a down-shifted d-band center relative to pure Pt."

[4] "After the cleavage of the second CH bond, the olefin intermediate adsorbs on the Pt catalysts with π- or di-σ-type binding depending on the catalyst surface property and coverage degree as well as the conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and composition of co-fed gases)"

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and dissociates, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A second hydrogen atom is removed from the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propylene intermediate.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene and hydrogen desorb from the catalyst surface as products.

There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. Some experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the first C-H bond cleavage (dissociative adsorption) is rate-limiting, while others indicate that the second C-H bond cleavage (β-H extraction) is the rate-determining step.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, catalyst development should focus on improving propane activation. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, efforts should concentrate on facilitating hydrogen removal.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal reaction conditions may differ depending on which step is rate-controlling, affecting parameters like temperature, pressure, and gas composition.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require correct identification of the rate-determining step, impacting predictions of reaction rates and yields.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The nature of the rate-limiting step influences the formation and stability of reaction intermediates, affecting our interpretation of the reaction pathway.

5. Catalyst deactivation: Understanding which step is rate-limiting can provide insights into catalyst deactivation mechanisms and guide strategies for improving catalyst stability.

This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and emphasizes the need for further research to elucidate the precise mechanistic details and develop more efficient catalysts.

反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制描述的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面吸附并解离，形成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中移除第二个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯中间体。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯和氢从催化剂表面脱附成为产物。

关于解离吸附还是β-H提取是该反应的速率控制步骤，目前仍存在争议。一些实验和理论研究表明，第一个C-H键断裂（解离吸附）是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则指出第二个C-H键断裂（β-H提取）是决定速率的步骤。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，催化剂开发应该关注于改善丙烷的活化。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，则应集中精力于促进氢的移除。

2. 反应条件：最佳反应条件可能因速率控制步骤的不同而异，影响温度、压力和气体组成等参数。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型需要正确识别速率决定步骤，这会影响对反应速率和产率的预测。

4. 机理理解：速率限制步骤的性质影响反应中间体的形成和稳定性，影响我们对反应路径的解释。

5. 催化剂失活：了解哪个步骤是速率限制步骤可以为催化剂失活机制提供见解，并指导改善催化剂稳定性的策略。

这个持续的争论突出了PDH过程的复杂性，并强调了需要进一步研究以阐明精确的机理细节和开发更高效的催化剂。
