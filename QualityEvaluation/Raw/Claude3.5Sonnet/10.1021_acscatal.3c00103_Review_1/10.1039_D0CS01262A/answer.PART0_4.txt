The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane molecule adsorbs on the catalyst surface and undergoes CH bond cleavage, forming adsorbed propyl species (1-propyl or 2-propyl).

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is removed from the adsorbed propyl species, resulting in the formation of adsorbed propylene.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface, completing the dehydrogenation process.

There is ongoing debate regarding which step is the rate-determining step (RDS) in the PDH reaction. Some studies suggest that the initial CH bond cleavage (dissociative adsorption) is the RDS, while others propose that the second CH bond activation (β-H extraction) is rate-limiting. The uncertainty stems from conflicting results obtained from different catalyst surfaces and experimental conditions.

For instance, on Pt(211) and Pt(100) surfaces with smaller Pt cluster sizes, the first CH bond activation is suggested to be the RDS. However, on Pt(111) surfaces, the second CH bond activation is proposed as the RDS. Additionally, a microkinetic analysis identified the first CH activation as the RDS on Pt(111).

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: Without a clear consensus on the RDS, it becomes challenging to optimize catalyst properties specifically for enhancing the rate-limiting step.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal reaction conditions may vary depending on which step is rate-determining, making it difficult to establish universally applicable operating parameters.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require proper identification of the RDS, and the current uncertainty may lead to discrepancies in predicting reaction rates and catalyst performance.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The ambiguity in the RDS hinders a complete understanding of the reaction mechanism, potentially overlooking important factors that influence the overall reaction rate.

5. Catalyst comparison: Evaluating the performance of different catalysts becomes more complex when the RDS is not consistently identified across various catalyst systems.

In conclusion, while the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism provides a general framework for understanding PDH, the ongoing debate about the RDS highlights the complexity of the process and the need for further research to reconcile conflicting observations and develop a more comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism.

逆向Horiuti-Polanyi机理用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附并发生CH键断裂，形成吸附的丙基物种（1-丙基或2-丙基）。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中移除一个氢原子，导致形成吸附的丙烯。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯分子从催化剂表面脱附，完成脱氢过程。

关于PDH反应中哪个步骤是速率决定步骤（RDS）仍存在争议。一些研究表明，初始CH键断裂（解离吸附）是RDS，而其他研究则提出第二个CH键活化（β-H提取）是速率限制步骤。这种不确定性源于不同催化剂表面和实验条件下获得的矛盾结果。

例如，在Pt(211)和Pt(100)表面上，对于较小的Pt簇尺寸，第一个CH键活化被认为是RDS。然而，在Pt(111)表面上，第二个CH键活化被提出为RDS。此外，微动力学分析确定在Pt(111)上第一个CH活化是RDS。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程产生了多方面影响：

1. 催化剂设计：没有明确的RDS共识，难以针对提高速率限制步骤来优化催化剂性能。

2. 反应条件：最佳反应条件可能因速率决定步骤的不同而变化，使得难以建立普遍适用的操作参数。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型需要正确识别RDS，当前的不确定性可能导致预测反应速率和催化剂性能时出现差异。

4. 机理理解：RDS的模糊性阻碍了对反应机理的完整理解，可能忽视了影响整体反应速率的重要因素。

5. 催化剂比较：当RDS在不同催化剂系统中无法一致识别时，评估不同催化剂的性能变得更加复杂。

总之，虽然逆向Horiuti-Polanyi机理为理解PDH提供了一般框架，但关于RDS的持续争论凸显了该过程的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究来调和矛盾的观察结果，并发展对反应机理更全面的理解。
