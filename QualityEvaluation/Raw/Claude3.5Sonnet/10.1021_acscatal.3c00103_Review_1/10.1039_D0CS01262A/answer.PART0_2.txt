[1] "It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism."

[2] "The dehydrogenation steps from propane to propylene is shown in Fig. 28(a) (steps 14), and the energy barriers for these four steps can describe the catalytic activity of metal surfaces for propylene production."

[3] "Both the dissociative adsorption of ethane and CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom275277 have been suggested as the RDSs."

[4] "The initial CH bond cleavage at the methyl (step 1) or methylene (step 2) groups of physisorbed propane is often the RDS that governs the rate law of the overall dehydrogenation reaction, leading to the 1-propyl or 2-propyl species."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and undergoes CH bond cleavage, forming adsorbed propyl species.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is removed from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl, resulting in the formation of adsorbed propylene.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene desorbs from the catalyst surface, completing the dehydrogenation process.

There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-determining step (RDS) in the PDH process. Some studies suggest that the dissociative adsorption of propane (the initial CH bond cleavage) is the RDS, while others propose that the β-H extraction step is rate-limiting.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If the dissociative adsorption is the RDS, catalyst development should focus on enhancing the CH bond activation ability. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, efforts should be directed towards facilitating this step.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal reaction conditions may vary depending on which step is rate-determining, affecting parameters such as temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models are crucial for process optimization and scale-up. The identification of the correct RDS is essential for developing reliable kinetic models.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and demonstrates that our understanding of the reaction mechanism is still evolving.

5. Catalyst characterization: Different experimental techniques may be required to probe the relevant surface species and intermediates, depending on which step is rate-limiting.

This ongoing debate underscores the need for continued research combining advanced experimental techniques, theoretical calculations, and kinetic modeling to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the PDH process and design more efficient catalysts.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷吸附在催化剂表面并发生CH键断裂，形成吸附的丙基物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基的β碳上移除一个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附，完成脱氢过程。

科学界对PDH过程中哪个步骤是速率决定步骤(RDS)存在持续争议。一些研究表明丙烷的解离吸附（初始CH键断裂）是RDS，而另一些研究认为β-H提取步骤是速率限制步骤。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程产生了以下影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是RDS，催化剂开发应该集中于提高CH键活化能力。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，努力应该集中于促进这一步骤。

2. 反应条件：最佳反应条件可能因速率决定步骤的不同而变化，影响温度、压力和反应物浓度等参数。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型对过程优化和放大至关重要。确定正确的RDS对开发可靠的动力学模型至关重要。

4. 机理理解：这一争议突显了PDH过程的复杂性，表明我们对反应机理的理解仍在不断发展。

5. 催化剂表征：根据哪个步骤是速率限制步骤，可能需要不同的实验技术来探测相关的表面物种和中间体。

这一持续的争议强调了需要继续进行研究，结合先进的实验技术、理论计算和动力学建模，以发展对PDH过程更全面的理解，并设计更高效的催化剂。
