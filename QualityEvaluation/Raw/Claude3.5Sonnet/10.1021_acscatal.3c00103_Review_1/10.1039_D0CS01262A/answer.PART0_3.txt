[1] "It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism."

[2] "The dehydrogenation steps from propane to propylene is shown in Fig. 28(a) (steps 14), and the energy barriers for these four steps can describe the catalytic activity of metal surfaces for propylene production."

[3] "Both the first and second CH bond activations of propane have been suggested as the RDSs."

[4] "Recently, however, Xiao et al. suggested that although PDH over Pt(111) follows the generally accepted reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, as shown in Fig. 29, an unexpected non-reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism over Pt(211) is proposed to dominate the kinetics."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs on the catalyst surface and undergoes CH bond cleavage to form adsorbed propyl species.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is extracted from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl, forming an adsorbed propylene intermediate.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene desorbs from the catalyst surface, completing the dehydrogenation process.

There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-determining step (RDS) in the PDH process. Some studies suggest that the initial dissociative adsorption of propane is the RDS, while others propose that the β-H extraction step is rate-limiting. This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If the dissociative adsorption is the RDS, catalyst development should focus on improving the CH bond activation ability. However, if β-H extraction is rate-limiting, efforts should be directed towards facilitating hydrogen removal from adsorbed intermediates.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal reaction conditions may vary depending on which step is rate-limiting. For example, higher temperatures might be more beneficial if dissociative adsorption is the RDS, while hydrogen partial pressure could be more critical if β-H extraction is rate-limiting.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models are essential for process optimization and scale-up. The uncertainty in the RDS makes it challenging to develop precise kinetic models that accurately predict reaction rates and product distributions.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and suggests that the reaction mechanism may be more nuanced than initially thought. This uncertainty drives further research to elucidate the detailed reaction pathways and intermediates involved.

5. Catalyst surface effects: The recent suggestion of a non-reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism on Pt(211) surfaces indicates that the reaction mechanism can be influenced by the catalyst surface structure. This complicates our understanding of the PDH process and emphasizes the importance of considering surface effects in catalyst design and mechanistic studies.

In conclusion, the ongoing debate about the rate-determining step in the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH underscores the complexity of the process and the need for continued research to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism. This knowledge is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts and optimizing industrial PDH processes.

反向Horiuti-Polanyi机理对于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面吸附并发生CH键断裂，形成吸附的丙基物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附丙基的β-碳上提取一个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯中间体。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附，完成脱氢过程。

科学界对PDH过程中哪一步是速率决定步骤(RDS)存在持续争议。一些研究表明丙烷的初始解离吸附是RDS，而其他研究则提出β-H提取步骤是速率限制步骤。这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几方面影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是RDS，催化剂开发应该侧重于提高CH键活化能力。但如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，则应该致力于促进吸附中间体的氢移除。

2. 反应条件：最佳反应条件可能会因速率限制步骤的不同而变化。例如，如果解离吸附是RDS，较高的温度可能更有利；而如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，氢的分压可能更为关键。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型对于过程优化和放大至关重要。RDS的不确定性使得开发能精确预测反应速率和产物分布的动力学模型变得具有挑战性。

4. 机理理解：这种争议突显了PDH过程的复杂性，表明反应机理可能比最初认为的更加微妙。这种不确定性推动了进一步研究，以阐明详细的反应路径和涉及的中间体。

5. 催化剂表面效应：最近对Pt(211)表面非反向Horiuti-Polanyi机理的建议表明，反应机理可能受催化剂表面结构的影响。这使我们对PDH过程的理解变得更加复杂，并强调了在催化剂设计和机理研究中考虑表面效应的重要性。

总之，关于PDH反向Horiuti-Polanyi机理中速率决定步骤的持续争议凸显了该过程的复杂性，以及需要继续研究以发展对反应机理更全面理解的必要性。这些知识对于设计更高效的催化剂和优化工业PDH过程至关重要。
