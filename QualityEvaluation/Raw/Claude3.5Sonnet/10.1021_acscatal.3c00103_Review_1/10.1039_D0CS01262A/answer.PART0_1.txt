[1] "It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism."

[2] "Both the dissociative adsorption of ethane and CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom have been suggested as the RDSs."

[3] "The initial CH bond cleavage at the methyl (step 1) or methylene (step 2) groups of physisorbed propane is often the RDS that governs the rate law of the overall dehydrogenation reaction, leading to the 1-propyl or 2-propyl species."

[4] "The first CH activation of propane was identified as the RDS on the Pt(111) by a microkinetic analysis. It should be noted that the energy barriers for the first and second CH bond activations are quite close on Pt(111). The RDS could change with the reaction conditions."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and breaks into propyl and hydrogen.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is removed from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl species, forming adsorbed propylene.

3. Desorption: The propylene product desorbs from the catalyst surface.

There is ongoing debate about whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH. Some studies suggest that the initial CH bond cleavage (dissociative adsorption) is often the RDS, while others indicate that the second hydrogen removal (β-H extraction) could be rate-limiting. The uncertainty arises from the fact that the energy barriers for these steps are quite close, especially on surfaces like Pt(111).

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is the RDS, catalyst development should focus on improving the initial CH bond activation. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, efforts should be directed towards facilitating this step.

2. Reaction conditions: The RDS may change depending on reaction conditions, complicating the optimization of industrial processes.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require correct identification of the RDS, affecting predictions of reaction rates and yields.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The ambiguity in the RDS makes it challenging to fully elucidate the reaction mechanism and identify intermediates.

5. Selectivity control: Different RDSs may lead to varying product distributions, affecting strategies for improving selectivity.

This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and emphasizes the need for further research combining experimental and theoretical approaches to resolve the uncertainty and develop more efficient catalysts and processes.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷吸附在催化剂表面并分解成丙基和氢。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种的β-碳上移除一个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯。

3. 脱附：丙烯产物从催化剂表面脱附。

关于PDH中是解离吸附还是β-H提取是速率决定步骤（RDS）存在持续的争论。一些研究表明，初始C-H键断裂（解离吸附）通常是RDS，而其他研究则指出第二个氢的移除（β-H提取）可能是速率限制步骤。这种不确定性源于这些步骤的能量障碍非常接近，特别是在像Pt(111)这样的表面上。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程的影响有以下几个方面：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是RDS，催化剂开发应该集中于改善初始C-H键活化。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，努力应该集中于促进这一步骤。

2. 反应条件：RDS可能随反应条件而变化，这使得工业过程的优化变得复杂。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型需要正确识别RDS，这影响反应速率和产率的预测。

4. 机理理解：RDS的模糊性使得完全阐明反应机理和识别中间体变得具有挑战性。

5. 选择性控制：不同的RDS可能导致不同的产品分布，影响改善选择性的策略。

这种持续的争论突显了PDH过程的复杂性，并强调了需要进一步结合实验和理论方法的研究，以解决这种不确定性，并开发更高效的催化剂和过程。
