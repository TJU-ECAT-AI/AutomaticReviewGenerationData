          [1] "It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism."

[2] "The dehydrogenation steps from propane to propylene is shown in Fig. 28(a) (steps 14), and the energy barriers for these four steps can describe the catalytic activity of metal surfaces for propylene production."

[3] "Both the first and second CH bond activations of propane have been suggested as the RDSs."

[4] "The initial CH bond cleavage at the methyl (step 1) or methylene (step 2) groups of physisorbed propane is often the RDS that governs the rate law of the overall dehydrogenation reaction, leading to the 1-propyl or 2-propyl species."

[5] "The experimental354 and theoretical analyses of Gibbs energy profiles of the PDH reaction340,353 suggest that the first CH bond activation is the RDS on Pt(211) and Pt(100) for smaller Pt cluster sizes, while the second CH bond activation is the RDS on Pt(111)."

[6] "The first CH activation of propane was identified as the RDS on the Pt(111) by a microkinetic analysis."

[7] "Recently, however, Xiao et al. suggested that although PDH over Pt(111) follows the generally accepted reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, as shown in Fig. 29, an unexpected non-reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism over Pt(211) is proposed to dominate the kinetics."

          The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and undergoes CH bond cleavage, forming adsorbed propyl species (1-propyl or 2-propyl).

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is removed from the adsorbed propyl, resulting in the formation of adsorbed propylene.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene desorbs from the catalyst surface, completing the dehydrogenation process.

There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-determining step (RDS) in this reaction. Some studies suggest that the initial CH bond cleavage (dissociative adsorption) is the RDS, while others indicate that the second CH bond activation (β-H extraction) could be rate-limiting. The uncertainty depends on various factors such as catalyst surface, cluster size, and reaction conditions.

For example:
- On Pt(211) and Pt(100) surfaces with smaller Pt cluster sizes, the first CH bond activation is proposed as the RDS.
- On Pt(111) surfaces, some studies suggest the second CH bond activation is the RDS, while others identify the first CH activation as rate-limiting.
- Recent research has even proposed an unexpected non-reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism over Pt(211) surfaces.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: Without a clear consensus on the RDS, it becomes challenging to optimize catalyst properties specifically for enhancing the rate-limiting step.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal reaction conditions may vary depending on which step is rate-limiting, making it difficult to establish universal operating parameters.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require correct identification of the RDS, and the current uncertainty may lead to discrepancies in predicting reaction rates and yields.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The ambiguity in the RDS complicates efforts to fully elucidate the reaction mechanism and identify intermediate species.

5. Catalyst comparison: Evaluating the performance of different catalysts becomes more challenging when the RDS may vary across catalyst types and surface structures.

This ongoing debate emphasizes the complexity of the PDH process and highlights the need for further research combining experimental and computational approaches to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism and resolve the uncertainty surrounding the rate-determining step.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷吸附在催化剂表面并发生CH键断裂，形成吸附的丙基物种（1-丙基或2-丙基）。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基中移除一个氢原子，导致形成吸附的丙烯。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附，完成脱氢过程。

关于该反应中解离吸附还是β-H提取是速率决定步骤（RDS）存在持续争论。一些研究表明，初始CH键断裂（解离吸附）是RDS，而其他研究则指出第二个CH键活化（β-H提取）可能是速率限制步骤。这种不确定性取决于多种因素，如催化剂表面、簇大小和反应条件。

例如：
- 在Pt(211)和Pt(100)表面上，当Pt簇尺寸较小时，第一个CH键活化被认为是RDS。
- 在Pt(111)表面上，一些研究表明第二个CH键活化是RDS，而其他研究则认为第一个CH活化是速率限制步骤。
- 最近的研究甚至提出了Pt(211)表面上存在意外的非逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：由于对RDS缺乏明确共识，难以针对提高速率限制步骤来优化催化剂性能。

2. 反应条件：最佳反应条件可能因速率限制步骤的不同而变化，使得难以建立通用的操作参数。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型需要正确识别RDS，当前的不确定性可能导致预测反应速率和产率时出现差异。

4. 机理理解：RDS的模糊性使得完全阐明反应机理和识别中间物种的努力变得更加复杂。

5. 催化剂比较：当RDS可能因催化剂类型和表面结构而异时，评估不同催化剂的性能变得更具挑战性。

这一持续的争论强调了PDH过程的复杂性，并突显了需要进一步结合实验和计算方法的研究，以获得对反应机理更全面的理解，并解决围绕速率决定步骤的不确定性。
