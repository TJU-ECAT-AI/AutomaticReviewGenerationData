Abstract
Zeolites and metal-zeolites are a class of porous materials that have been widely utilized in industry. So far, several fundamental questions relating to the dynamic evolution of the zeolite framework and the metal-zeolite interface remain unanswered. Contrary to the classical view of zeolites as a static, rigid, and changeless material, the framework atoms and foreign metals in zeolites can dynamically interconvert under the pretreatment or reaction conditions, making it difficult to identify the real active centers and mechanisms. With the development of characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, a more profound understanding of the dynamic evolution of zeolite framework and metal-zeolite interface at the atomic scale has been achieved. This critical Review will feature the recent progress of the dynamic evolution of zeolite and metal-zeolites, mainly focusing on the TOT bonds breaking and formation, metal valence state transformation, phase evolution, and migration. We compare these proposed mechanisms and analyze their suitability in distinct experimental conditions. We highlight that the identification of the active sites and catalytic mechanism of zeolites and metal-zeolites should be cautious and should consider the dynamic evolution of the active centers under reaction conditions. Finally, we summarize the usages and limitations of different characteristic techniques, propose some future research directions about the dynamic evolution of zeolites and metal-zeolites, and hope to bridge the gaps between the knowledge achieved in characterizations and the real nature of the active sites to guide zeolite-based materials synthesis, modification, and application.

1. Introduction
Catalysts are the footstone of the modern chemical industry, which can conspicuously accelerate the reaction rate, shorten the reaction time, and reduce energy consumption. As an important type of solid catalysts, zeolites have become the backbone in some crucial chemical processes, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), (1,2) methanol-to-olefin (MTO), (36) methanol-to-ethanol, (79) and coupling conversion of hydrocarbon and methanol/COx to aromatization. (1013) Zeolites are a class of crystalline microporous materials with a key feature of well-defined channels/cages for reactant molecules adsorption, transformation, and reaction, which are constructed from the connections of corner-sharing TO4 tetrahedra (T = Si, Al, P, etc.). Owing to the presence of AlO4 in aluminosilicate zeolites and SiO4 in silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, the negative charge of zeolite framework requires a balancing cation (usually H+) to ensure electroneutrality, resulting in another key feature of Brnsted acid sites (BAS). (14,15) By controlling the synthesis conditions, diverse metals (e.g., Ti, Sn, Ge, Zr, and Nb) can be introduced into the zeolite framework, forming heteroatomic zeolites with Lewis acidity. (16,17) Besides, the extra-framework metal species with single, cluster, and nanoparticle structures can be accommodated into zeolite channels/cages. (1820) Until now, more than 250 topologies of zeolites with various compositions and acidities have been developed by bottom-up and top-down strategies, exhibiting many unrivalled catalytic performances (e.g., shape selectivity, (2123) dynamic autocatalysis, (24,25) and synergistic catalysis). (26,27) Although a lot of progress has been achieved, many aspects of the active sites and catalytic mechanisms in zeolites and metal-zeolites are still under debate.
Ordinarily, zeolites are regarded as a rigid material owing to their high crystallinity, thermal stability, and renewability for various catalytic reactions. As a matter of fact, fast bond breaking and formation, metal valence state transformation, phase evolution, and migration can be observed over the zeolites and metal-zeolites even at a moderate temperature. (2830) It is necessary to change the classical concept of zeolites as static and solid materials to a novel belief that to some extent, zeolites are dynamic, labile, and flexible under practical reaction conditions. In general, the evolution of framework atoms and foreign metals in zeolites is strongly dependent on the reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and steam/reductive/oxidative/acid/base atmosphere) and nature of zeolites (e.g., topology, Si/Al ratio, and crystallinity). (31,32) Representatively, H2O can prolong the life-span of SAPO-34 in MTO by depressing the coke formation or converting coke to active intermediates in MTO catalysts through decreasing the barrier for hydrogenation of heavy aromatic deposits to active aromatic intermediates (33,34) but can also cause zeolite dealumination, desilication, and deactivation. (35,36) Indeed, the metastable property of zeolites was found when they were first synthesized, but it has not been well understood in the past. With the development of in situ and operando characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, a lot of fundamental and in-depth understandings about the dynamic evolution of zeolites and metal-zeolites have been obtained, providing some useful directions and principles to synthesize and modify zeolite-based materials with optimal properties for target reactions.
This Review summarizes the recent processes of the dynamic evolution of zeolite framework and metal-zeolite interface under pretreatment or reaction conditions, aiming to bridge the gap between the measured and actual active sites. The interactions between the host zeolites/metal-zeolites and guest molecules will be globally and dynamically illustrated at the atomic level. The structure of this review is as follows: Section 2 presents the dynamic evolution of the zeolite framework, focusing on the TOT reversible and irreversible breaking and formation. The evolution mechanism of zeolites including aluminosilicates, aluminophosphates, and heteroatom zeolites will be compared and discussed. Section 3 reviews the dynamic evolution of metal species in metal-zeolites, mainly about the valence state transformation, phase evolution, and migration under reaction conditions. The mechanisms, characterizations, and novel findings will be summarized and discussed. In section 4, the challenges and outlook of the future research directions about the dynamic evolution of the active sites embedded into zeolites will be proposed and concluded.
2. DYNAMIC EVOLUTION OF ZEOLITE FRAMEWORK
Different from the classical concept of zeolite as a static material, the TOT bonds of zeolites can dynamically break and form under reaction conditions. Among the various studies, the interactions between zeolites and H2O have drawn particular attention because H2O is a common medium for zeolite synthesis, modification, and applications. It is known that H2O is involved in the hydrolysis, condensation, and crystallization processes of zeolites but can also lead to zeolite destruction and deactivation. Therefore, making clear the interaction mechanisms is of great importance. However, these interactions are complex because the H2O inside zeolites possesses distinct structures as compared with those in an environment without confinement. (3741) Furthermore, the conditions (e.g., temperature, partial pressure, and amount) can affect the structure of H2O (i.e., single, cluster, and bulk). (4244) In this part, we clarify the dynamic evolution of zeolites into reversible and irreversible hydrolysis of TOT bonds and compare these mechanisms at the atomic level.
2.1. Reversible Breaking and Formation of TOT Bonds
Aluminosilicate Zeolites
Contrary to the classical view of zeolite as a static, rigid, and changeless material, recent studies found that the TOT bonds of zeolites could be reversibly broken and formed under moderate steam treatment conditions, showing a dynamic and reversible feature. For instance, Heard et al. developed a 17O isotope labeling experiment using H217O and demonstrated that the CHA zeolite could be reversibly hydrolyzed in neutral liquid water without framework degradation. (28) They proposed a novel mechanism for SiO bonds hydrolysis, in which the SiO bonds started to be hydrolyzed through the interaction between a H2O molecule and framework O. Subsequently, a H2O molecules chain was formed and attached to the adjacent framework O, resulting in SiO cleavage with a low barrier of 63 kJ mol1. (45,46) Ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) results revealed the AlO bond hydrolysis was much easier than SiO bonds so that the AlO bonds could be hydrolyzed by a single H2O to form a H2OAlO3 tetrahedron. Furthermore, 17O isotope labeling experiments were performed, and the corresponding 17O nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra exhibited obvious framework 17O signals (Si-17O-Si at 33 ppm and Si-17O-Al at 2025 ppm), demonstrating the presence of a quick equilibrium of hydrolyzed and unhydrolyzed zeolite framework in H217O. This work gives a novel insight into the static zeolites that are labile and dynamic with fast bond breakage and recovery in H2O atmosphere.
Later, Ashbrook and co-workers compared two zeolites (MOR and FER) and two agents (17O2 and H217O), finding that the 17O in these two zeolites were more easily enriched by H217O than 17O2. (29) They also found that the 17O-exchanged orders of different TOT bonds were strongly dependent on the type of guest molecules. In the atmosphere of H217O, 17O atoms preferentially incorporated into the SiOAl bonds, e.g., (Si17OAl):(Si17OSi) ratio of 1.3:1 for the MOR zeolite exchanged by H217O for 18 h. However, a (Si17OAl):(Si17OSi) ratio of 0.18:1 was obtained over the 17O2-exchanged MOR zeolite at the same condition, which is similar to the calculated (SiOAl):(SiOSi) ratio (0.2:1, Si/Al = 11). Besides, they investigated the 17O-exchanged behavior of Na-MOR in H217O and found that the enrichment of 17O in Na-MOR was slower than H-MOR zeolite, suggesting the Na+ had negative effects on the isotopic exchange process. However, the mechanisms were not proposed and confirmed. Recently, Sholl and co-workers studied the hydrolysis mechanisms of the first AlO bond in protonic and cationic (Na, K, and Ca) LTA zeolites and demonstrated that the cationic LTA zeolites were more kinetically stable than H-LTA owing to the different dissociation processes of H2O in H-LTA and cationic LTA zeolites. (47) Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the hydrolysis reaction in H-LTA followed the H2O dissociation and proton transfer and rotation, while a second transfer of the proton was observed in cationic LTA zeolites. Therefore, the first AlO bonds did not break concurrently with H2O dissociation in cationic LTA zeolites, resulting in a higher energy barrier than that on H-LTA. Noticeably, the free energy for the AlOSi bond cleavage by two H2O molecules is a little higher than that by a single H2O molecule, which is different from some previous studies. (28,29) Therefore, more systematic and quantitative experiments are necessary to give more convincing evidence about the TOT breakage and formation mechanism of cationic zeolites.
Silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) Zeolites
At nearly the same time as the above work was published, our work investigated the hydrothermal treatment of the aluminosilicate phosphate zeolites (SAPO-34) in H217O atmosphere, in which the dynamic and reversible breaking and formation of TOT bonds in SAPO-34 occurred at the moderate temperature in the range of 100300 C (Figure 1). (48) On the basis of 17O NMR spectroscopy, the dynamic incorporation of 17O from H217O into the SAPO-34 framework were illustrated in detail. The 1D and 2D 17O NMR spectra of the 300 C-treated SAPO-34 in H217O possessed two obvious signals at around 21 ppm (Si-17O-Al) and 48 ppm (P-17O-Al), indicating the 17O atoms were well incorporated into the SAPO-34 framework without obvious degradation. Owing to the relatively high H217O-exchanged temperature, the 17O incorporation mechanism was proposed: (i) A single H2O was adsorbed onto Al atoms in both SiOAl and POAl bonds. (ii) The TOT bonds were hydrolyzed through the formation of SiO3OH···HOAlO3 and PO3OH···HOAlO3. (iii) A dehydration reaction over SiO3OH···HOAlO3 and PO3OH···HOAlO3 resulted in the recovery of SiOAl and POAl bonds.

Creatively, we took advantage of the reversible evolution of the TOT bonds in SAPO-34 zeolite to characterize the acidity of SAPO-34 through cointroduction of H2O and trimethylphosphine (TMP)/pyridine. Multiple characterizations (1H decoupled 31P MAS NMR, 1H MAS NMR, and confocal fluorescence microscopy measurements) demonstrated that a large amount of TMP and pyridine were introduced into the SAPO-34 cages with cofeeding H2O and TMP/pyridine. However, almost no TMP/pyridine could be detected in SAPO-34 when only TMP/pyridine was introduced for adsorption and diffusion, demonstrating that the H2O molecule could open the 8-membered ring (8-MR) window of SAPO-34. Furthermore, theoretical calculations confirmed that the diffusions of TMP and pyridine in the 8-MR window of SAPO-34 were not feasible with a high energy barrier of 40 kcal mol1. When one or two TOT bonds in the 8-MR window were broken, the diffusion energies for TMP and pyridine could be dramatically decreased, that is, 13.8 and 6.5 kcal mol1 for TMP and pyridine diffusion through the 8-MR window of SAPO-34 with two opposite TOT bonds broken. The reversible breaking and formation of TOT bonds in SAPO-34 helped to realize the introduction of TMP and pyridine into the cavities of SAPO-34, which can be used to characterize the acidity of zeolites with smaller pore windows than probe molecules.
Another innovation, the TMP/pyridine modified SAPO-34 zeolites were applied for MTO reactions, exhibiting improved ethene selectivity. The pyridine accommodation established the diffusion obstacle for the produced long-chain alkenes, which improved the catalytic performance of SAPO-34 zeolite in the MTO reaction. This ship-in-a-bottle strategy is an effective way to illustrate the dynamic and reversible evolution of zeolite, to characterize the zeolite acidity, and to functionalize the zeolites for various applications including MTO. Very recently, a similar work about the dynamic evolution of the SAPO-34 framework in MTO was reported by Dai and co-workers that the hydrolysis of POAl bonds was found in the spent SAPO-34 after a short time stream treatment at a high reaction temperature of 400 C. (49) With the proceeding of MTO, hydrocarbon pool species would be formed in the cages and pores of SAPO-34, which could cover some BAS and POAl bonds and thereby prevent the SAPO-34 framework from hydrolysis by H2O. Contrast experiments about SAPO-34 with/without precoking illustrated that the organic deposits in SAPO-34 zeolite could act as a protective agent to enhance the stability of SAPO-34 zeolite.
Apart from H2O, other guest molecules (e.g., methanol) can lead to the reversible evolution of the zeolite framework. Recently, Zheng and co-workers reported that the methanol adsorbed onto the pristine SAPO-34 zeolite could induce a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP, three-coordinated framework Al as Lewis acid site and SiO(H) as Lewis basic site), which was favorable for the formation of surface methoxy species (SMS) during MTO reaction. (50) Multiple characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the methoxy species were first bonded to the framework Al in the induced FLP state with the hydroxyl proton attached to the Lewis base sites, and the dynamic evolution of FLP could accelerate the catalytic reaction. In situ DRIFT experiments about 16O/18O-methanol adsorption demonstrated that the oxygen species in SMS were from the methanol, confirming the proposed mechanism. This work gives a novel and dynamic insight into the active sites and catalytic mechanism of MTO reaction and proposes a possible route for SMS species formation. Later, Chen et al. extended the FLP concept into the supramolecular in MTO reaction using SAPO-34 and ssz-13 zeolite, in which the polymethylbenzenium (PMB+) functioned as the Lewis acid to accept an electron pair, and the deprotonated framework oxygen site acted as the Lewis base to donate an electron pair. (51) Theoretical calculations and experimental results verified that this FLP could catalyze H2 heterolysis and dehydrogenation of alkanes. This work convinces us that the identification of the active sites and catalytic mechanisms should be cautious and should consider the dynamic evolution of intermediates during the catalytic process.
Heteroatomic Zeolites
In the 1990s, several studies reported that the SiOTi bonds in TS-1 zeolites could be reversibly transformed into the titanol TiOH and the silanol SiOH species, and the TiO bonds could reversibly convert to SiO2Ti(OH)2. (52,53) Later, To et al. studied the interactions between H2O and Ti sites using a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical method. (54) In the presence of one H2O molecule, the insertion of one H2O increased the coordination number of Ti atom from four to five in the tetrapodal, tripodal, bipodal, and titanyl configurations, and then from five to six. In the presence of two H2O molecules, there are two models (i.e., mono(aquo) and bis(aquo) complexes). Particularly, bis(aquo) tripodal model was the most stable structure, suggesting that the hydrolysis and inversion of tetrahedral sites could boost the reactivity of Ti sites with H2O. Furthermore, Qi et al. developed a two-dimensional proton-detected 1H/119Sn correlation solid-state NMR spectroscopy to characterize Sn-Beta zeolites before and after hydrolysis by H2O, revealing the presence of reversible interconversion of Sn sites in Beta zeolites. (55) Typically, Sn-Beta zeolite with 97.4% 119Sn was synthesized using isotope 119Sn precursor. Then, two-dimensional 1H {119Sn} HMQC MAS NMR experiments were performed over 119Sn-Beta dehydrated at 393 K with and without 119Sn decoupling. Similar to the monoalkyl-SnCl3x(OH)x, the two-dimensional 1H {119Sn} HMQC MAS NMR spectra of 119Sn-Beta dehydrated at 393 K exhibited four signals, suggesting the presence of two types of open Sn sites ((SiO)3SnOH) located at different T sites. Furthermore, 1H {29Si} D-HMQC NMR experiments were conducted over 119Sn-Beta dehydrated at 393 and 673 K, showing an obvious decrease of the signal of Si(OSi)3OH, which was due to the transformation of open (SiO)3SnOH to closed (SiO)4Sn species. When the 119Sn-Beta was rehydrated, the closed (SiO)4Sn could be transformed into (SiO)3SnOH species, showing a visible signal in the 1H {119Sn} HMQC NMR spectrum. This work develops the approach of solid-state NMR spectroscopy to identify the dynamic and reversible interconversion of (SiO)3SnOH and (SiO)4Sn species in zeolites, giving an insight into the dynamic evolution of metal sites in heteroatomic zeolites.
2.2. Irreversible Breakage of TOT Bonds
The irreversible breakage of TOT bonds is a common phenomenon in zeolites, such as dealumination, desilication, and secondary pore formation, which would result in a partial loss in acidity, structure collapse, and/or zeolite deactivation. (5658) Different from the reversible breakage of TOT bonds, the irreversible breakage of TOT bonds is a violent reaction, in which the framework TOT bonds would be deeply broken or even be removed from the framework. Herein, the irreversible breakage of TOT bonds over different zeolites are compared and discussed.
Aluminosilicate Zeolites
It is known that zeolites can be hydrolyzed in acidic and alkaline solutions. (59,60) However, these processes are difficult to control, usually leading to structure collapse and inhomogeneity demetalization from the surface to the interior of zeolites. As a neutral medium, H2O vapor and steam can be used as a suitable agent to control the zeolite modification through adjusting the H2O partial pressure and treatment temperature. However, the interactions between H2O and zeolites are complex owing to the complex structure of H2O molecules.
To simplify the interactions between H2O and zeolites, Swang and co-workers chose a natural first strategy by adding H2O molecules sequentially (Figure 2, a single H2O molecule). (61) As a consequence, the demetalization processes can be regarded as a series of hydration reactions: (i) Dealumination process: First, hydration results in a vicinal disilanol defect, and reorientation of the vicinal disilanol creates a SiOH and an AlOH. Second, hydration produces two SiOH and two AlOH. Third, hydration results in Al(OH)3 with hydrogen bond to SiOH. Fourth, H2O molecule adsorption generates the final Al(OH)3(H2O) compound. (ii) Desilication process: Similar but different to the dealumination process, the fourth hydration results in Si(OH)4 rather than Al(OH)3(H2O). However, very high barriers for dealumination (190 kJ mol1) and desilication (260 kJ mol1) were obtained. Later, a microkinetic model was built to analyze the dealumination process of H-SSZ-13 zeolite and found that the first hydrolysis step was insignificant for the kinetics of zeolite dealumination, and the fourth hydrolysis step could be used to estimate the dealumination rate at the temperature over 700 K. (62) Furthermore, several different mechanisms have been proposed for the AlO bond hydrolysis. For instance, a BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship was established by Silaghi et al. (Figure 2, a single H2O molecule) that the H2O adsorption on the Al atom at the antiposition to the Brnsted acid site to create a penta- or distorted tetra-coordinated Al species; subsequently, the adsorbed H2O was dissociated at the adjacent framework O atoms, leading to the first AlO(H) bond breaking with relatively low activation energies of 76125 kJ mol1. (63,64) Very recently, a similar dealumination mechanism of H-BEA zeolite was proposed by Mei and co-workers using AIMD simulations. (65) It was found that the hydrolysis step started by proton transfer, and then one H2O molecule attracted the Al atom at the antiposition of the protonated OAl atom, resulting in one AlOAl bond breaking and one AlOW bond formation. The free energy barriers of these four hydrolysis steps are 16.6, 20.8, 69.3, and 50.0 kJ/mol, respectively, which are a little lower than those in MOR, FAU, and CHA zeolite. Recently, the distorted tetra-coordinated Al species were detected by Chen et al. using NMR at 35.2 T, (66,67) further confirming the possibility of the BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship mechanism for TOT bond breakage.

In recent years, several studies proposed that the collective mechanism considering the interactions between H2O molecules was more suitable for TOT bond irreversible breaking than a single H2O mechanism. (68,69) For instance, Stanciakova et al. reported that the AlO(H) scission was induced by two adsorbed H2O molecules involving five mechanisms (Figure 2, two H2O molecules): (68) (i) Mechanism I is identical to the previous reported single H2O molecule model. (63,64) (ii) Mechanism II (water-mediated proton transfer) is similar to the mechanism I, but it only has dually coordinated mode B which allows proton transfer and thereby lowers the reaction barrier. (iii) In mechanism III (water insertion), one H2O would be adsorbed onto the original protonated oxygen atom and another H2O would be attached on the Al atom, forming a vicinal disilanol with one H2O adsorbed onto the original protonated oxygen atom; subsequently, AlOH and SiOH are formed after AlOH-Si cleavage. (iv) In mechanism IV (spontaneous AlO(H) breaking), AlO(H) bond breaking occurs from a dually coordinated mode B. By comparing these four mechanisms to the single H2O mechanism, it was found that the second H2O molecule could accelerate the AlO(H) bond breaking, lowering the energy barriers. In fact, H2O clusters with different structures (1D or 3D chain of H2O molecules containing hydrogen bonds) could be formed in zeolites. (28,37,70) These H2O molecules can collectively break the TOT bonds with a low activation barrier. In section 2.1, collective mechanisms about reversible breaking of TOT bonds and formation have been discussed in detail.
Apart from H2O, several other reagents have been used for zeolite demetalization at the atomic level (e.g., SiCl4 and NH4F). A recent work by Mintova and our group demonstrated that the application of NH4F for zeolite treatment could selectively open the sodalite (SOD) cages of Y zeolites by removing the framework T atoms from SOD cages. (71) This work illustrated the dynamic evolution in porosity, micropores to mesopores, and enlarged mesopores in Y zeolite, by multicharacterizations and DFT calculations (Figure 3): Three-dimensional transmission electron microscopy (3D-TEM) revealed that mesopores were initially formed by etching the wall of cages. Subsequently, two or multiple mesopores would merge into enlarged mesopores. NMR characterization about Xe diffusion demonstrated that Xe molecules were first penetrated through the opened SOD cages and then diffused to supercages of the mesoporous zeolites. DFT calculations confirmed that Xe diffusion between SOD and supercages likely took place at the defects of six-member-ring separating these two types of cages, which was caused by the NH4F treatment. This study opens up an efficient way to achieve zeolites with controlling mesopores, thus improving the catalytic performance in 1,3,5 tri-isopropylbenzene dealkylation and n-octane hydroconversion.

SAPO Zeolites
Different from aluminosilicate zeolites, SAPO zeolites possess different TOT bonds (e.g., POAl bonds and (AlO)3SiOH-Al microstructure), which usually exhibit some unique properties relative to aluminosilicate zeolites. In the 1990s, H2O adsorbed in SAPO-34 has been studied by experiments and ab initio simulations, revealing the presence of hydronium (H3O+), H5O2+ dimers, and H3O+(H2O)n clusters in SAPO-34. (72,73) However, the violent reaction mechanism between H2O and the SAPO zeolite framework is rarely reported. Recently, several studies based on theoretical calculations have been performed to study the demetalization processes of SAPO zeolites. For instance, Fjermestad et al. reported that the demetalization processes of SSZ-13 and SAPO-34 zeolites were strongly dependent on the proton location, in which the SSZ-13 and SAPO-34 zeolites possessed the same mechanism for the first TOT bond hydrolysis but the different mechanisms for deep hydrolysis. (74) Typically, the first TOT bond hydrolysis in both SSZ-13 and SAPO-34 was through the formation of a vicinal disilanol defect (Al-(OH)2-Si). For SAPO-34, after the first TOT bond cleavage, the proton was transferred to a nearby SiOAl to form a SiOH and three AlOSi species (S2b-H2O), while in SSZ-13, the proton was still bonded to an oxygen atom (SiOH-Al) with one SiOH, one AlOH, and one SiOAl (Z2-H2O). Later, they proposed two new pathways for SAPO-34 desilication involving stepwise hydrolyses of SiOAl bonds: (75) (i) A single H2O molecule was coordinated to Al atom rather than to the proton, lowering the SiOAl bond breaking energy. (ii) Two H2O molecules were adsorbed onto the acidic proton and Al atom, respectively, to break the TOT bonds. As compared with the H2O molecule interacting with an acidic proton, (74) H2O molecule coordinated to Al atom can lower the activation barrier of TOT scission, which is crucial for the breakage of the TOT bonds. Furthermore, the formation of Si islands in SAPO-34 has been reported that the silanol nests generated by desilication could be healed by an available H3PO4 molecule, and the framework position of the P atom could be healed by the extra-framework Si(OH)4. (76) Hence, Si islands were formed because of the repeated migration and location of framework and extra-framework P and Si species.
Furthermore, several experimental studies were carried out to illustrate the interactions between H2O and SAPO zeolites. A typical example by Kolokathis et al. studied the instability of SAPO-37 after H2O adsorption at different temperatures by in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). (77) The in situ SR-PXRD and H2O adsorption measurements revealed that the temperature could significantly affect the H2O affinity and stability of SAPO-37: At the temperature below 345 K, SAPO-37 had the strongest affinity to H2O, which could adsorb an order of magnitude more H2O molecules than at the temperature above 345 K. As a consequence, the massive adsorbed H2O in SOD cages could dramatically change the TOT angles of 4-rings at the SOD-d6r-SOD interface (e.g., the TO4T angle decreased from 166 to 101 after it adsorbed H2O in a matter of seconds), leading to the structure collapses. Therefore, the high concentration of H2O around the acid centers and defects, together with the geometry of the framework, is the main reason for the structural destabilization of SAPO-37. Until now, only several experimental studies have been exploited to study the stability of SAPOs in hydrothermal treatment, which is probably due to the too rapid change of the structure to be directly evidenced.
Heteroatomic Zeolites
Previous publications have reported the interactions between H2O molecules and heteroatomic zeolites (e.g., Sn-Beta, TS-1, and Ge-UTL). (7882) Wolf et al. proposed two hydration pathways for Sn-Beta zeolites: (79) (i) A H2O molecule in the second coordination sphere of Sn atom leads to the SnOSi bond cleavage to a SiOH and a SnOH. (ii) A H2O molecule is coordinated to Sn atom and generates a Sn(OH)Si and a SnOH. Similar results were obtained by Sushkevich et al. that the H2O could induce Brnsted acid sites in Sn-BEA zeolites. (80) By NMR and FTIR spectroscopy, they demonstrated the formation of new bridged OH groups (Sn-(OH)-Si) in Sn-Beta zeolite, which possessed strong Brnsted acidity and could lead to pyridine protonation. Besides, the type of guest molecules can affect the coordination states of Sn species. Yakimov et al. compared three different guest molecules (acetonitrile, methanol, and H2O) adsorbed on Sn-Beta zeolites and found that the acetonitrile and methanol would be adsorbed on Sn atom to result in pentacoordinated Sn species, while a H2O molecule was first adsorbed onto Sn to result in pentacoordinated Sn species and subsequently hexacoordinated species would be generated after long time reaction. (81)
Besides, the partial pressure of H2O can affect the interactions between H2O and zeolites. Jin et al. reported that the reversible and irreversible adsorption of H2O on Ge-UTL zeolites was strongly dependent on the partial pressure of H2O (Figure 2, multi-H2O molecules). (82) H2O sorption analysis indicated that the H2O adsorption on Ge-UTL with different Si/Ge ratios was reversible at P/P0 < 0.3 and irreversible at P/P0 > 0.3. Mechanistic analysis based on molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the interactions between H2O and Ge-UTL zeolite framework followed four mechanisms: (i) The equatorial-inversion mechanism for Ge-poor Ge-UTL in low H2O partial pressure, a single H2O molecular was attached to one GeOf bond to form Ge(OfSi)3OwH (Q3) and SiOfH. (ii) The vicinal mechanism for Ge-rich Ge-UTL in low H2O partial pressure, a single H2O was attached to two GeOf bonds (GeOfGe) to produce Ge-(OfHw)(OwHw)-Ge. (iii) The axial mechanism for Ge-poor Ge-UTL in high H2O partial pressure, H2O chain with four H2O molecules (one-dimensional hydrogen bonds) was attached to Ge and the adjacent O atom in one GeOf bond, resulting in GeOwH and SiOfH species. (iv) S2R mechanism for Ge-rich Ge-UTL in high H2O partial pressure, a H2O molecule with two hydrogen bonds reacted with Ge atom to result in Ge-(Of)(Ow)-Ge species and two protons in the channel, in which one of the protons tended to attach to the Ge-(Of)(Ow)-Ge. In particular, the H2O amount played a key role in determining the reversible and irreversible processes of GeO bonds: (i) Reversible breaking and formation of GeO bonds occurred in both Ge-poor and Ge-rich Ge-UTL zeolites in the condition of low H2O partial pressure. (ii) In the presence of H2O with high partial pressure, deep decomposition of GeO bonds would occur involving collective mechanisms (axial and S2R).
On the basis of the above analysis, it can be concluded that the guest molecules tend to coordinate to the metal sites in heteroatomic zeolites and weaken the MOSi bond by increasing the coordination number of metal sites which cause the cleavage of the MOSi to form MOH and SiOH bonds. However, most studies are focused on only one H2O molecule or step-by-step hydrolysis process, which cannot reflect the real dynamic interactions between H2O and metal sites. Furthermore, metal species in zeolites as heteroatoms only possess low amounts and LAS, which are hard to identify by some characterization techniques such as XRD, NMR, and FTIR spectroscopy. Therefore, more efficient characterization approaches should be developed to give more convincing evidence about the dynamic evolution of heteroatoms in the zeolite framework.
3. DYNAMIC EVOLUTION OF METAL SITES IN METAL-ZEOLITES
The introduction of metal species into zeolites is a promising and efficient approach to construct solid catalysts. The channels/cages of zeolites are smaller than 1 nm, which can provide a confined microenvironment to stabilize metal species and modify their chemical and electronic properties. Different from the framework atoms of zeolites, the metal species in zeolites possess various structures and states, which can interconvert to each other under different conditions. In recent years, the dynamic evolution of foreign metals in zeolites has been gradually discovered and illustrated. Herein, we summarize the recent progress about the dynamic evolution of metal sites in zeolites, mainly about the valence state transformation, metal phase transformation (metal carbides and metal hydrides), and metal migration.
3.1. Valence State Transformation
Supported metal species on zeolite generally possess several different states, which are strongly dependent on the loading amount, synthesis conditions, and support types. During the catalytic reaction, the valence states of metal species can be transformed from one to another, showing reversible and/or irreversible features. (8385) Over the past several years, the dynamic evolution of metal active sites in zeolites have been found in several catalytic reactions (e.g., methane dehydroaromatization (MDA), (85) selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NOx), (86,87) and methane oxidation to methanol). (83,8891) In these reactions, the dynamic evolution of valence states of the supported metal species can induce the energetically feasible with lower activation energy. In the following subsection, a case-by-case discussion about the dynamic evolution of Fe and Cu species in zeolites will be provided in detail.
It is known that Fe species possess three typical valence states, i.e., +3, +2, and 0, which can be interconverted under different oxidative or reductive conditions (Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe). Being confined in zeolites, the states of Fe species can be increased because the zeolite microenvironment can stabilize Fe sites with a high coordination number. (9295) Consequently, the dynamic evolution of the unique structure of Fe species in zeolite would result in many special performances. A typical example by Snyder et al. reported that the Fe species confined by CHA and BEA zeolites exhibited different renewability in the reaction of CH4 hydroxylation to CH3OH due to the presence of different cages in CHA and BEA (Figure 4a). (95) From the topological structure perspective, the Fe-BEA and Fe-CHA zeolites possess high similarity in the first coordination spheres (mononuclear and high-spine Fe(IV)O species) but different local porous environments (i.e., α-Fe(IV)O in BEA and CHA can be accessed through 12-MR (5.9 Å) and 8-MR (3.7 Å), respectively). Therefore, the reactant CH4 with van der Waals diameter of 4.14.2 Å diffuse through the pore aperture must be hindered in CHA (3.7 Å). After the CH bond breaking, the CH3 radicals formed in small pore CHA zeolite cannot be released from the active sites, accelerating CH3 radicals to form CH3OH rather than deactivated FeOCH3 species. As to Fe-BEA, CH3 radicals can be easily released from the Fe active sites in BEA zeolite with large pore apertures, resulting in deactivated Fe species in the form of α-Fe(III)OH and α-Fe(III)OCH3. Therefore, 40% of active sites in Fe-CHA can be regenerated during the CH4 oxidation process, while Fe-BEA deactivates completely after a single turnover. Furthermore, the dynamic evolution of Fe states has been found in the supported dimeric Fe complexes toward CH4 selective oxidation and NOx-SCR. (9699) Different from single Fe sites, there are several kinds of dimeric Fe species in zeolites, for example, 2 × [FeO]+, [OFe(μ-O)Fe]2+, and [Fe(μ-O)2Fe]2+. (96) A recent study about the CH4 selective oxidation on Fe/ZSM-5 was reported in which the initial Fe sites ([(H2O)2Fe(III)(μO)2Fe(III)(H2O)2]2+) could be first oxidized by H2O2 to form Fe(III)-oxo and Fe(IV)-oxo complexes. (97) Then, the oxidized Fe sites promoted the CH bond scission through three possible mechanisms: heterolytic, hemolytic methane dissociation, and Fenton-type reaction. Notably, the dynamic evolution of Fe sites gives rise to Fe(III)-oxo and Fe(IV)-oxo from [(H2O)2Fe(III)(μO)2Fe(III)(H2O)2]2+ species. These two Fe species working as the reaction centers significantly decreased the activation energy of CH bond cleavage.

Zeolites with Cu confined ions are one of the most widely reported metal-zeolites for several reactions (e.g., NH3SCR and CH4 oxidation to CH3OH). Typically, Cu has +1 and +2 valence states and can reversibly transform from one to another, showing the oxidationreduction property. (100102) After the introduction of Cu species into zeolites, the framework O atoms can provide a 4-fold coordination environment to stabilize Cu ions, modifying the nature of Cu species. In the 1970s, Cu-exchanged Y zeolite was reported as an efficient catalyst for NH3SCR of NOx, but the catalytic mechanism was not proposed and demonstrated. (103) In recent years, the type of Cu active sites in zeolites has been identified, for example, isolated Cu species (ZCu2+OH, ZCu+, and Z2Cu2+; Z represents zeolite) and dimeric Cu complexes (Cu2+O-Cu2+). (104106) These Cu active sites application in the NH3SCR reaction exhibit different activity, stability, and mechanism, in which the dynamic evolution of Cu ions in zeolite plays crucial roles in determining reaction performance and exact mechanistic pathways. For example, Paolucci et al. reported that isolated Z2Cu2+ could travel through adjacent CHA zeolite windows to form transient Cu2+OCu2+ pairs during SCR reaction, providing a suitable configuration for O2-mediated Cu+  Cu2+ redox step (Figure 4b). (107) It is worthwhile to note that the electrostatic tethering to framework Al sites and the limited volume of CHA zeolite cage can only result in one Cu2+O-Cu2+ pair. By the aid of steady-state measurements, characterizations, and theoretical calculations, the catalytic mechanisms on single Cu2+ and the Cu2+OCu2+ pair were determined as the following: single Cu2+ catalyzed the reduction, one SCR half-cycle, while Cu2+OCu2+ catalyzed the oxidation, the other SCR half-cycle. Accordingly, the reaction conditions and Cu density can significantly affect the dynamic evolution ability of Cu species, affecting the SCR performance of Cu-CHA catalysts. Apart from that, the dynamic evolution of Cu states in zeolite is also of great importance for methane selective oxidation to methanol. (108112) Sushkevich et al. reported that Cu2+ centers would transform into Cu+ during the beginning period of methane oxidation and then Cu+ could be oxidized to Cu2+ by H2O (Figure 4c). (108) Methanol desorption experiments, XAS and FTIR spectroscopic studies, and theoretical calculations illustrated that the reversible change of Cu ions (Cu2+  Cu+) realized the regeneration of active centers, accelerated methanol desorption, and importantly minimized the activation energy of the selected pathway for methane to methanol. Different than O2, the water returned two electrons, producing reactive Cu2+ and H2. It is notable that only the limited size of CHA zeolite pores can generate mono(m-oxo)dicopper active sites, enabling H2O acting as an oxidant to regenerate Cu sites and simultaneously stabilize reaction intermediates and transition states.
3.2. Metal Carbides
In many catalytic reactions (e.g., alkane conversion and FischerTropsch synthesis) involving metal-zeolite catalysts, metal species existing in oxidation state in the fresh catalyst could transform into metal carbides during the reaction, thereby affecting the catalytic performance and mechanism. (83,85,113) Among the various metals, Mo and Fe species supported on HZSM-5 have been widely reported for the formation of metal oxycarbidic and carbide counterparts. In the fresh Mo-zeolite samples, there are many kinds of Mo species on zeolites, e.g., MoOx cluster, isolated MoO4 and MoO6, MoO4MoO6 chain, and MoO3O-MoO3 dimer. (114) Upon utilization Mo-zeolite in MDA reaction, molybdenum oxycarbide (MoxCyO), and carbide (MoxCy) with different structures and stoichiometry would be formed with the reaction. (115119) Recently, Lezcano-Gonzlez et al. developed an operando XAS to study the nature of Mo species during MDA reaction and revealed that the dynamic evolution of Mo species inside HZSM-5 zeolites played key roles in determining the MDA performance (Figure 5a). (118) Initially, isolated Mo-oxo species would convert to MoCxOy species by CH4, which were primarily responsible for C2Hx/C3Hx formation. With the reaction progress, MoC3 clusters would be generated, which were responsible for benzene formation. The further long-time reaction led to the transformation of MoC3 to larger Mo2C-like nanoparticles on the external surface of HZSM-5 zeolite, which was less active. Furthermore, CO-FTIR, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) measurements and DFT calculations confirmed the transformation of Mo species within zeolites. (119,120) To make full utilization of the dynamic evolution of Mo species, the chemical looping process is introduced into the Mo-zeolites catalyst system for MDA reaction, which can improve the activity and efficiency. (121,122) Apart from the Mo sites, iron carbide species have been reported in Fe-zeolite catalysts toward hydrocarbon transformation. (123125) These findings can help us to better understand the actual active sites and catalytic mechanism of metal-zeolites in actual reaction conditions and guide meal-zeolites design and synthesis.

3.3. Metal Hydrides
Surface hydrides have been reported over the past several decades but are difficult to identify owing to their complexity and instability. (126,127) Zeolites possess a well-defined structure, which is beneficial to clarify the evolution process of metal to metal hydrides. In recent years, several studies reported that metal species inside zeolites could transform into metal hydrides, which could act as the active sites for various catalytic reactions, e.g., alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocarbon dehydroaromatization. For instance, there are many kinds of Ga species in the Ga-zeolites, such as GaxOy, Ga+, [GaO]+, [GaH2]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH(OH)]+, and [GaH]2+. (128) Under the H2 atmosphere at high temperature, the oxidized Ga species can be transformed to GaHx. (129135)In situ FTIR experiments demonstrated that the Ga species variation could replace the acidic proton sites (BAS) of zeolite and subsequently formed Ga monohydride and Ga dihydride during H2 reduction. (129,130) Later, Bell and co-workers characterized the isolated Ga3+ cations in Ga/HZSM-5 zeolites under oxidizing and reducing conditions by XAS measurements, revealing the presence of [Ga(OH)2]+ or [Ga(OH)2]+-H+ cation pairs in oxidizing conditions and [Ga(OH)2]+-H+ cation pairs, [GaH2]+-H+, and [GaH]2+ in H2 atomosphere. (133) Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the type of Ga species on Ga-zeolites was strongly dependent on the pretreatment conditions and the location (next-nearest neighbor (NNN) and next-next-nearest neighbor (NNNN) framework Al atoms) (Figure 5b): In the conditions of H2O pressure of 10 Pa and H2 partial pressure <102 Pa for all the temperatures, [Ga(OH)2]+-H+ cation pairs in NNNN sites are the most stable structure. When the temperature was higher than 623 K, [Ga(OH)2]+-H+ cation pairs in NNN sites would transform to [Ga(OH)]2+. When the H2 partial pressure is in the range of 103105 Pa with 10 Pa H2O, [Ga(OH)2]+-H+ cation pairs in NNNN sites would undergo further hydrogenation to form [Ga(OH)H]+H+ pairs. At the H2 pressure of >105 Pa and temperature of >673 K, [GaH2]+H+ pairs would be formed from [Ga(OH)H]+H+ pairs in NNNN sites. For Ga species at NNN sites, at temperature of <623 K and H2 pressure of >102 Pa, [Ga(OH)2]+-H+ cation pairs would convert to [Ga(OH)H]+-H+ pairs. When the temperature is higher than 623 K, these cations would transform to [GaH2]+ species. In different reactions and reaction periods, the various active sites of Ga-zeolites, for example, framework Ga species, tetrahedrally coordinated extra-framework Ga sites, and [GaH2]+, are demonstrated active for ethylene dehydroaromatization, (128,136) and GaHx and Ga+-H+ pair sites are regarded as the active sites for alkane dehydrogenation. (131,132,134,135,137) Apart from GaHx, InHx and ZnHx in zeolites have been also reported during pretreatment in H2, which were proposed as the active sites for hydrocarbon transformation. (138141)
3.4. Metal Migration
Metal leaching and sintering are inherent characteristics of supported metal catalysts, which would lead to catalyst deactivation during the catalytic reaction. Typically, the confinement of metal species within zeolites can improve the stability of metal sites. However, they still suffer from sintering at harsh reaction conditions, e.g., high temperature and reductive atmosphere. For a long time, the dynamic migration of metal species in zeolites has not been well understood owing to the complex structure of metal species and zeolites under practical reaction conditions. With the development of characterization techniques, great progress has been achieved over some metal-zeolites, e.g., Ag-MFI, (142) Pd/USY, (143,144) Pd-CHA, (145) Pt-CHA, (146) Pt-MCM-22, (147) PtSn@MFI, (148) Au/TS-1, (149) and metal oxides/HZSM-5. (150)
A typical example by Corma and co-workers reported that the Pt nanoparticles could be reversibly transformed to single atoms in high-silica CHA zeolite (Figure 5c, left). (146) By time-resolved X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and in situ TEM techniques, the dynamic evolution of Pt species including the coordination environment and microtopography in CHA zeolites in different atmospheres and temperatures were obtained: Calcination in the air at 500 C, Pt species with 3 PtO bonds at 2.01 Å and no PtPt bonds could be observed in XAFS spectra, indicating the formation of isolated PtO3 units within the CHA zeolites. When the oxidized Pt-CHA was treated in H2 at the temperature of 25400 C, the Pt species would be gradually reduced to Pt clusters, as confirmed by a progressive decrease of the white line intensity at different temperatures. In particular, the onset temperature for Pt species reduction is lower than 100 C, and the full reduction temperature is about 150 C. After further oxidation of the reduced Pt-CHA, a progressive increase of the white line could be observed over the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra, suggesting the transformation of PtPt bonds to PtO bonds. To further identify the local structure of Pt species, in situ high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) experiments were performed. A progressive disappearance of the Pt nanoparticles could be observed after exposure of the H2-reduced Pt-CHA to O2 at 500 C, suggesting the redispersion of the Pt clusters to atomically Pt species. This study demonstrates that the Pt species in the types of single atoms and clusters can be tuned reversibly by controlling the calcination conditions, i.e., temperature and atmosphere. Furthermore, different pretreated conditions (i.e., CO + O2, CO + H2O, NO + CO, and NO + H2) have been studied for Pt@MCM-22, showing similar trends to Pt-CHA. (147) Under reductive atmosphere (CO + O2 and CO + H2O), atomically dispersed Pt would aggregate into Pt clusters at the temperature of 100300 C. In an oxidative atmosphere (NO + CO and NO + H2), Pt clusters would disperse into atomically Pt species at the temperature of 200400 C. These results suggest that the Pt species are strongly sensitive to the reactants and conditions. Therefore, the actual active sites of metal-zeolites should be globally and dynamically considered involving the reactant atmosphere and temperature.
Furthermore, the migration of metal oxides can be observed in oxide-zeolite system (metal oxide supported on zeolites). Recently, Wang and co-workers reported that the migration of metal oxides (In2O3, ZnO, Cr2O3, and ZrO2) on HZSM-5 zeolite could be observed by HAADF-STEM, elemental mapping, and pyridine-FTIR techniques, which could affect the CO2 hydrogenation performance (Figure 5c, right). (150) HAADF-STEM and elemental mapping revealed that the thermo-migration ability of metal species was strongly dependent on the metal species. A large amount of In and Zn species could be detected in HZSM-5 after CO2 hydrogenation reaction, while almost no Cr and Zr species could be detected. Acidity characterizations (pyridine-FTIR and ammonia-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD)) demonstrated that the In and Zn species could be easily migrated to the acidic proton sites of HZSM-5 via a solid ion-exchange mechanism, decreasing the acidity of HZSM-5. Therefore, In2O3/HZSM-5 and ZnO/HZSM-5 exhibited much lower catalytic stability than Cr2O3/HZSM-5 and ZrO2/HZSM-5 in CO2 hydrogenation. The migration of metal oxides in zeolites is a common phenomenon for oxide-zeolites, but it is complex and has multiple pathways. Therefore, more systematic and quantitative experiments should be performed to determine the mechanism and driving force of the migration process of active metal species in zeolites.
4. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
Herein, we review the dynamic evolution of the zeolite framework and metal-zeolite interface under various conditions (e.g., temperature, atmosphere, and partial pressure), uncovering some fundamental features about the active sites and catalytic mechanisms. We clarify the interactions between H2O and zeolite framework and reveal the reversible and irreversible hydrothermal procedure. Further, we note that the number of H2O molecules can significantly affect the TOT bond breaking and formation mechanisms. Furthermore, the type, composition, and topological structure of zeolites can affect the interactions between H2O and zeolites and thereby affect the properties of zeolites. For metal-zeolites, the dynamic evolution of metal sites in zeolites is strongly dependent on the types of metal species and redox properties of the reactants. The evolution of valence states and migration of metals can be reversibly realized by controlling the oxidizing and reducing atmosphere. Besides, metal carbides and hydrides could be formed upon introducing hydrocarbons and hydrogen at a certain temperature. These controllable dynamical evolutions of the zeolite framework and metal-zeolite interface can be used as the approaches for zeolite modification and application. However, understandings about the dynamic evolution of framework and extra-framework atoms of zeolites are still scarce and far from complete and in-depth. It is necessary to exploit more experiments to make clear the dynamic evolution processes and synergetic effect of the framework and foreign metals including the location, dispersion mode, identification and evolution of active sites, and the formation and role of intermediates. In Figure 6, we propose three future research directions, including characterization, mechanism, and application.
Figure 6
Figure 6. Future research directions about the dynamic evolution of zeolites and metal-zeolites.
4.1. Structure under Real Reaction Conditions
In the past, zeolites and metal-zeolites are usually characterized in static conditions. However, fast bond breaking and formation, evolution of metal valence states, phase transformation, and migration would occur over the zeolites and metal-zeolites during the catalytic reaction. Therefore, the identification of active sites and catalytic mechanisms should globally consider the evolution of zeolites and metal species under reaction conditions.
In recent years, many in situ and operando techniques have been exploited for the characterization of zeolite-based catalysts, which can give some credible information about the dynamic evolution of the zeolite framework and metal-zeolite interface. For instance, time-resolved Rietveld refinement of XRD and NMR have been used to reveal the type of Al species and the evolution of the zeolite crystallinity. (151153) However, some zeolites and metal-zeolites contain only a small amount of metal species, which cannot be detected by XRD and NMR techniques. Therefore, more sensitive characterizations should be performed to distinguish these metal species. Recently, in situ XAS is used to characterize single metal atoms within zeolites, which can give information about the valence state, coordination number, and microstructure of framework and metal sites in zeolites, e.g., Al (three-coordinate, tetrahedral, and octahedral Al species), (154,155) Cu (Cu+  Cu2+), (108) and Mo (Mo6+  MoOxCy  Mo2C) species. (118) Also, 3D-TEM together with Xe-NMR have been used to study the dealumination process of faujasite (FAU) type zeolites, revealing the mesopore formation started by removing framework T atoms from sodalite cages. (71) However, the application of XAS and TEM techniques have some limitations, such as the difficulty in distinguishing the second coreshell atoms and light elements. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is used to monitor the evolution of hydroxy groups and probe molecules (e.g., pyridine, acetonitrile, and carbon monoxide) adsorbed onto zeolites, giving some important information about the structure and acidity of zeolites and metal-zeolites. (156,157) However, the interactions between H2O and zeolites are hard to identify by FTIR because of the presence of complex hydrogen-bonding networks between SiOH, AlOH, and H2O molecules. Besides, the FTIR experiments are usually performed at low temperature and diluted reaction atmosphere, which cannot reflect the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions. The development of more efficient and sensitive characterization techniques that are applicable at reaction conditions is very necessary. Apart from the in situ and operando approaches, the dynamic evolution process can be illustrated by rational design ex situ experiments, such as isotope labeling tests, (94,108,158) half-reactions with only one reactant, (108,159) and kinetic measurements. (160) Furthermore, theoretical calculations (i.e., AIMD) can be used to simulate the dynamic evolution of zeolite framework at picosecond scale. (50) Therefore, multiple techniques and theoretical calculations should be synchronously performed to identify the active sites and reveal the catalytic mechanism of zeolites and metal-zeolites.
4.2. Dynamic Mechanism of the Active Sites in Zeolites
Some dynamic procedures of framework atoms and foreign metals in zeolites are complex and very fast, which are difficult to be captured and identified. With the development of characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, some progress has been achieved step by step. Typically, the TOT bonds reversible/irreversible breaking and formation, demetalization mechanism, and the dynamic evolutions of foreign metals in zeolites have been illustrated in recent years. However, still many issues call for the solution (e.g., the precise location, number, kind, and structure of the framework atoms and foreign metals under reaction conditions). Furthermore, the complexity and variability of reaction mechanisms and pathways caused by the dynamic evolution of reaction active sites make research more challenging and require more advanced, sensitive, and dynamic techniques. Therefore, more efficient time-resolved and space-resolved approaches should be developed, and these advanced technologies should be applied to track the dynamic process of active centers and their catalytic roles in zeolite/metal-zeolite catalyzed reactions.
4.3. Taking Full Advantage of the Dynamic Nature of Zeolites and Metal-Zeolites
The hydrothermal process is crucial for both the construction of zeolite crystals and the converse process of degrading zeolite framework in a hydrothermal atmosphere for optimized distribution of acid sites and improved mass transfer. Over the past several years, H2O vapor and steam have been used for zeolite modification (e.g., dealumination, desilication, and pore formation), improving the stability and diffusion properties of guest molecules. However, most studies are focused on the irreversible breaking of TOT bonds, mainly including zeolite destruction, collapse, and amorphization. The reversible evolution properties of zeolites are often overlooked. Recently, our work demonstrated that the reversible breaking and formation of TOT bonds of SAPO-34 could be used to introduce large molecules into small pore cages (ship-in-bottle strategy), thereby realizing acid sites recognition and MTO process adjusting. (48) These new strategies can be further promoted and applied. More creative, systematic, and reliable experiments and attempts are highly required to take full advantage of the dynamic evolution properties of zeolites in practical reactions.
For metal-zeolites, the dynamic evolution of metal species in zeolites has drawn particular attention in recent years, in which the varied active sites can accelerate the reactant activations or participate in the whole catalytic cycle. For example, the chemical looping process is introduced into some metal-zeolites (e.g., Mo/ZSM-5 and Fe-ZSM-5) for methane dehydroaromatization, which can improve activity and efficiency. In these processes, the Mo and Fe species can be dynamically interconverted from metal oxides to metal oxycarbidic and carbide counterparts. Owing to the participation of the lattice oxygen rather than oxygen molecule during the catalytic reaction, the energy consumption can be reduced. However, the metal-zeolites which are suitable for the operation mode of chemical looping process are limited, and the principles and mechanisms are still under debate.
In view of the current research of zeolite materials and catalysis, future studies are suggested to focus on the following aspects to realize some meaningful achievements: (i) developing in situ/operando spectroscopy techniques to make clear the dynamic nature of active sites and catalytic processes; (ii) making good use of the dynamic evolution property of zeolites and metal-zeolites for catalyst design, synthesis, modifications, and applications; and (iii) on the basis of the dynamic nature of catalytic materials and their roles in some important industrial process, developing dynamic modulation strategies to realize precise control and optimization of the zeolite materials and zeolite-catalyzed processes.
