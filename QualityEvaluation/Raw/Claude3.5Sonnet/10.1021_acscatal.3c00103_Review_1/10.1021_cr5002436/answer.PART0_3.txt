[1] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."

[2] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."

[3] "DFT calculations performed on Pt, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn (111) surfaces during the PDH reaction have revealed that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step."

[4] "To summarize, most of the experimental results suggest that the dehydrogenation of light alkanes proceeds via the HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, where either the dissociative adsorption of the alkane or the second CH bond cleavage is the rate-determining step."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and splits into adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A second hydrogen atom is removed from the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propylene molecule and another adsorbed hydrogen atom.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene and hydrogen molecules desorb from the catalyst surface.

There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. Some studies suggest that the dissociative adsorption of propane is rate-limiting, while others propose that the β-H extraction step controls the overall reaction rate. 

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, catalysts should be optimized to facilitate propane adsorption and splitting. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the focus should be on improving hydrogen removal from adsorbed propyl species.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations may differ depending on which step is rate-controlling.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require correct identification of the rate-determining step to predict reaction rates and yields effectively.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The nature of the rate-limiting step provides insight into the reaction pathway and potential intermediates, which is crucial for developing improved catalysts and processes.

5. Catalyst deactivation: Understanding which step is rate-limiting can help in addressing catalyst deactivation issues, as the slowest step is often most susceptible to inhibition or poisoning.

This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and the need for further research to elucidate the precise mechanistic details, which is essential for optimizing industrial PDH processes and developing more efficient catalysts.

Horiuti-Polanyi的反向机制在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面吸附并分裂成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中移除第二个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯分子和另一个吸附的氢原子。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯和氢分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于PDH反应中是解离吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤，目前仍存在争议。一些研究表明丙烷的解离吸附是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则认为β-H提取步骤控制整体反应速率。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程产生了以下影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，催化剂应该被优化以促进丙烷的吸附和分裂。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，重点应该放在改善吸附丙基物种的氢去除上。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和反应物浓度可能会因速率控制步骤的不同而有所差异。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型需要正确识别速率决定步骤，以有效预测反应速率和产率。

4. 机理理解：速率限制步骤的性质为反应路径和潜在中间体提供了洞察，这对开发改进的催化剂和工艺至关重要。

5. 催化剂失活：了解哪个步骤是速率限制步骤可以帮助解决催化剂失活问题，因为最慢的步骤通常最容易受到抑制或中毒。

这一持续的争论突显了PDH过程的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以阐明确切的机理细节，这对于优化工业PDH过程和开发更高效的催化剂至关重要。
