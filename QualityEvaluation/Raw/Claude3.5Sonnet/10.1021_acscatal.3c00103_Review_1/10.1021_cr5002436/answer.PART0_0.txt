[1] "This mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."

[2] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."

[3] "DFT calculations performed on Pt, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn (111) surfaces during the PDH reaction have revealed that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface and dissociate, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A second hydrogen atom is extracted from the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propylene molecule and another adsorbed hydrogen atom.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene and hydrogen molecules desorb from the catalyst surface.

There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. Some studies suggest that CH cleavage steps (including β-H extraction) are rate-limiting, while others propose that the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin is the rate-limiting step. DFT calculations on Pt-based catalysts have indicated that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is rate-limiting.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, catalyst development should focus on improving the adsorption properties of the surface. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, efforts should concentrate on optimizing the electronic properties of the catalyst to facilitate hydrogen abstraction.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal reaction conditions may differ depending on which step is rate-limiting. For example, higher temperatures might be more beneficial if dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, while different pressures might be optimal if β-H extraction is the bottleneck.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models of the PDH process require correct identification of the rate-limiting step. Uncertainty in this area can lead to less accurate predictions of reactor performance and catalyst behavior.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The debate highlights the complexity of the PDH mechanism and the need for more advanced characterization techniques to elucidate the details of each step in the reaction.

5. Catalyst deactivation: Understanding the rate-limiting step can provide insights into catalyst deactivation mechanisms and guide strategies for improving catalyst stability.

This ongoing uncertainty underscores the need for further research combining advanced spectroscopic techniques, computational modeling, and careful kinetic studies to definitively identify the rate-controlling step in PDH and optimize catalyst performance.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷分子吸附在催化剂表面并解离，形成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中提取第二个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯分子和另一个吸附的氢原子。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯和氢分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于PDH中是解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤，目前仍存在争议。一些研究表明CH断裂步骤（包括β-H提取）是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则认为烷烃的解离吸附是速率限制步骤。在基于Pt的催化剂上进行的DFT计算表明，烷烃的解离吸附是速率限制步骤。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程产生了多方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，催化剂开发应该集中在改善表面的吸附特性上。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，则应该集中精力优化催化剂的电子特性以促进氢的提取。

2. 反应条件：最佳反应条件可能因速率限制步骤的不同而有所不同。例如，如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，较高的温度可能更有利；而如果β-H提取是瓶颈，不同的压力可能是最佳选择。

3. 动力学建模：PDH过程的准确动力学模型需要正确识别速率限制步骤。这一领域的不确定性可能导致对反应器性能和催化剂行为的预测不太准确。

4. 机理理解：这一争论凸显了PDH机理的复杂性，以及需要更先进的表征技术来阐明反应中每个步骤的细节。

5. 催化剂失活：了解速率限制步骤可以为催化剂失活机理提供洞察，并指导改善催化剂稳定性的策略。

这种持续的不确定性强调了需要进一步的研究，结合先进的光谱技术、计算机模拟和仔细的动力学研究，以明确识别PDH中的速率控制步骤并优化催化剂性能。
