[1] "This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical. The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."

[2] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction. (96, 98, 144, 290)"

[3] "DFT calculations performed on Pt, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn (111) surfaces during the PDH reaction have revealed that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step."

[4] "In these mechanisms, either the dissociative adsorption (144, 305) or β-H elimination is believed to be the rate-limiting step. (306, 309, 310)"

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and dissociates, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A second hydrogen atom is removed from the adsorbed propyl species, resulting in the formation of an adsorbed propylene molecule and another adsorbed hydrogen atom.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene and hydrogen molecules desorb from the catalyst surface.

There is ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction. Some studies suggest that the dissociative adsorption of propane is the rate-limiting step, while others propose that the β-H extraction is the slowest step in the process.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, efforts should focus on improving the catalyst's ability to break C-H bonds. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the focus should be on facilitating hydrogen transfer.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations may differ depending on which step is rate-limiting.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require correct identification of the rate-determining step to predict reactor performance and optimize process conditions.

4. Mechanistic studies: The uncertainty highlights the need for more advanced in-situ and operando characterization techniques to directly observe the elementary steps during the reaction.

5. Catalyst deactivation: Understanding which step is rate-limiting can provide insights into potential deactivation mechanisms and guide the development of more stable catalysts.

Given this ongoing debate, further research using advanced spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations is needed to definitively determine the rate-controlling step in PDH and refine our understanding of this important industrial process.

逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理对于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面吸附并解离，形成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中移除第二个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯分子和另一个吸附的氢原子。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯和氢分子从催化剂表面脱附。

在科学界，关于PDH反应中哪个步骤是速率控制步骤存在持续的争论。一些研究表明丙烷的解离吸附是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则提出β-H提取是过程中最慢的步骤。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，努力应该集中在改善催化剂断裂C-H键的能力上。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，重点应该放在促进氢转移上。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和反应物浓度可能会因速率限制步骤的不同而有所差异。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型需要正确识别速率决定步骤，以预测反应器性能和优化工艺条件。

4. 机理研究：这种不确定性突出了需要更先进的原位和操作条件表征技术，以直接观察反应过程中的基本步骤。

5. 催化剂失活：了解哪个步骤是速率限制步骤可以为潜在的失活机制提供insights，并指导开发更稳定的催化剂。

鉴于这种持续的争论，需要进一步使用先进的光谱技术和理论计算来明确确定PDH中的速率控制步骤，并完善我们对这一重要工业过程的理解。
