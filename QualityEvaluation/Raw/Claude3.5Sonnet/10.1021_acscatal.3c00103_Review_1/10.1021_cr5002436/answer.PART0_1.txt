[1] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."

[2] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."

[3] "DFT calculations performed on Pt, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn (111) surfaces during the PDH reaction have revealed that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step."

[4] "The authors proposed that when the catalyst was reduced with H2 and CH4, detrimental OH groups were formed. V4+ was determined to be the most active species in butane dehydrogenation."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and dissociates into a propyl group and a hydrogen atom.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is extracted from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl group, forming an adsorbed propylene molecule and a second hydrogen atom on the catalyst surface.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene and hydrogen molecules desorb from the catalyst surface.

There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction. Some studies suggest that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step, particularly based on DFT calculations performed on platinum-based catalysts. However, other research indicates that the CH cleavage steps, which include β-H extraction, could be rate-limiting.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, catalyst development should focus on improving the ability of the catalyst surface to break the initial CH bond. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, efforts should be directed towards facilitating the removal of the second hydrogen atom.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations may differ depending on which step is rate-limiting.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models of the PDH process require correct identification of the rate-limiting step.

4. Promoter selection: Different promoters may be more effective depending on which step is rate-limiting.

5. Mechanistic understanding: The uncertainty hinders a complete understanding of the reaction mechanism, which is crucial for further optimization of the process.

6. Catalyst deactivation: The primary cause of catalyst deactivation may differ depending on which step is rate-limiting, affecting strategies for prolonging catalyst lifetime.

This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and the need for further research to definitively determine the rate-limiting step under various reaction conditions and for different catalyst systems.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷吸附在催化剂表面并解离成丙基和氢原子。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基的β碳上提取一个氢原子，在催化剂表面形成吸附的丙烯分子和第二个氢原子。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯和氢分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是PDH反应的速率控制步骤，目前仍存在争议。一些研究表明，烷烃的解离吸附是速率限制步骤，特别是基于铂基催化剂的DFT计算。然而，其他研究表明，CH断裂步骤（包括β-H提取）可能是速率限制步骤。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，催化剂开发应该集中于改善催化剂表面断裂初始CH键的能力。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，努力应该集中于促进第二个氢原子的移除。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和反应物浓度可能会因速率限制步骤的不同而有所不同。

3. 动力学建模：PDH过程的准确动力学模型需要正确识别速率限制步骤。

4. 助剂选择：不同的助剂可能会因速率限制步骤的不同而具有不同的效果。

5. 机理理解：这种不确定性阻碍了对反应机理的完整理解，而这对进一步优化过程至关重要。

6. 催化剂失活：催化剂失活的主要原因可能会因速率限制步骤的不同而有所不同，这会影响延长催化剂寿命的策略。

这种持续的争论突出了PDH过程的复杂性，以及需要进行进一步研究以明确确定在各种反应条件下和不同催化剂系统中的速率限制步骤。
