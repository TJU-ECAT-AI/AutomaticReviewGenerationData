[1] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."

[2] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."

[3] "DFT calculations performed on Pt, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn (111) surfaces during the PDH reaction have revealed that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step."

[4] "On the contrary, DFT calculations showed that propylene is preferentially adsorbed in the disigma mode."

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface and dissociate into propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A second hydrogen atom is extracted from the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propylene molecule.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene and hydrogen molecules desorb from the catalyst surface.

There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in PDH. Some studies suggest that the dissociative adsorption of propane is rate-limiting, while others propose that the β-H extraction step controls the overall reaction rate.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: The debate affects how researchers approach catalyst optimization. If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, efforts may focus on improving the catalyst's ability to break C-H bonds. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the focus may shift to facilitating hydrogen transfer.

2. Reaction conditions: The rate-controlling step influences how reaction conditions affect the overall process. For example, if dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, increasing propane partial pressure might have a more significant effect on reaction rate.

3. Kinetic modeling: The uncertainty complicates the development of accurate kinetic models for PDH, as the rate equations would differ depending on which step is considered rate-limiting.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and the need for more advanced characterization techniques to elucidate the reaction mechanism in greater detail.

5. Catalyst deactivation: Understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate catalyst deactivation, as the formation of coke precursors may be linked to specific mechanistic steps.

In conclusion, the ongoing debate about the rate-controlling step in PDH underscores the need for further research to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism, which is essential for optimizing industrial PDH processes and developing more efficient catalysts.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理主要包括三个步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷分子吸附在催化剂表面并解离成丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中提取第二个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯分子。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯和氢分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于PDH反应中是解离吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤，目前仍存在争议。一些研究表明丙烷的解离吸附是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则认为β-H提取步骤控制整个反应速率。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：这一争议影响研究人员如何优化催化剂。如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，努力可能集中在提高催化剂断裂C-H键的能力上。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，焦点可能转移到促进氢转移上。

2. 反应条件：速率控制步骤影响反应条件如何影响整个过程。例如，如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，增加丙烷分压可能对反应速率产生更显著的影响。

3. 动力学建模：这种不确定性使得为PDH开发准确的动力学模型变得复杂，因为根据考虑哪个步骤是速率限制步骤，速率方程会有所不同。

4. 机理理解：这一争议突显了PDH过程的复杂性，以及需要更先进的表征技术来更详细地阐明反应机理。

5. 催化剂失活：理解速率限制步骤对于开发减缓催化剂失活的策略至关重要，因为焦炭前体的形成可能与特定的机理步骤有关。

总之，关于PDH中速率控制步骤的持续争论凸显了进一步研究的必要性，以发展对反应机理更全面的理解，这对于优化工业PDH过程和开发更高效的催化剂至关重要。
