          "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."

"Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction."

"DFT calculations performed on Pt, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn (111) surfaces during the PDH reaction have revealed that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step."

"To summarize, most of the experimental results suggest that the dehydrogenation of light alkanes proceeds via the HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, where either the dissociative adsorption of the alkane or the second CH bond cleavage is the rate-determining step."

"In these mechanisms, either the dissociative adsorption (144, 305) or β-H elimination is believed to be the rate-limiting step. (306, 309, 310)"

          The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface and dissociate, forming adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A second hydrogen atom is extracted from the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propylene molecule and another adsorbed hydrogen atom.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene and hydrogen molecules desorb from the catalyst surface.

There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction. Some studies suggest that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step, particularly based on DFT calculations performed on platinum-based catalysts. However, other research indicates that the CH cleavage steps, which include β-H extraction, could be rate-limiting.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: The debate affects how researchers approach catalyst optimization. If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, efforts may focus on improving the catalyst's ability to break C-H bonds. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, the focus may shift to facilitating hydrogen transfer.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations may differ depending on which step is rate-controlling.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models of the PDH process require correct identification of the rate-limiting step to predict reaction rates and yields effectively.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and the need for more advanced characterization techniques to elucidate the reaction mechanism in greater detail.

5. Catalyst deactivation: Understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate catalyst deactivation, as the formation of coke precursors may be linked to specific mechanistic steps.

6. Further research: The ongoing debate underscores the need for further research using advanced spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations to definitively determine the rate-controlling step in PDH and refine our understanding of this important industrial process.

This uncertainty in identifying the rate-controlling step highlights the complexity of the PDH process and emphasizes the need for continued research to optimize industrial PDH processes and develop more efficient catalysts.

          丙烷脱氢(PDH)的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机理包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷分子吸附在催化剂表面并解离，形成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中提取第二个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯分子和另一个吸附的氢原子。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯和氢分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于PDH反应中是解离吸附过程还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤，目前仍存在争议。一些研究表明，烷烃的解离吸附是速率限制步骤，特别是基于铂基催化剂的DFT计算。然而，其他研究表明，CH断裂步骤（包括β-H提取）可能是速率限制步骤。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：这一争议影响研究人员如何优化催化剂。如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，努力可能集中在提高催化剂断裂C-H键的能力上。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，焦点可能转移到促进氢转移上。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和反应物浓度可能会因速率控制步骤的不同而有所不同。

3. 动力学建模：PDH过程的准确动力学模型需要正确识别速率限制步骤，以有效预测反应速率和产率。

4. 机理理解：这一争议突显了PDH过程的复杂性，以及需要更先进的表征技术来更详细地阐明反应机理。

5. 催化剂失活：理解速率限制步骤对于开发减缓催化剂失活的策略至关重要，因为焦炭前体的形成可能与特定的机理步骤有关。

6. 进一步研究：持续的争论凸显了需要使用先进的光谱技术和理论计算进行进一步研究，以明确确定PDH中的速率控制步骤，并完善我们对这一重要工业过程的理解。

这种在识别速率控制步骤上的不确定性突显了PDH过程的复杂性，并强调了需要继续研究以优化工业PDH过程和开发更高效的催化剂。
