Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), its steps, or the debate regarding the rate-controlling step. The document appears to be only a title and some bibliographic information for an article about coke formation on a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Without access to the full text of the article, it is not possible to answer the question based on this limited information.

The provided literature does not contain any information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), its steps, or the debate regarding the rate-controlling step. The text appears to be a partial citation or abstract for an article about coke formation on a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, but it does not provide any details about the reaction mechanism or kinetics. Therefore, I cannot answer the question based on the given information.
