Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or its steps. The document appears to be a bibliographic entry for a 1934 paper by Horiuti and Polanyi on exchange reactions of hydrogen on metallic catalysts, but does not provide any details about the mechanism or the ongoing debate regarding the rate-controlling step. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot accurately explain or discuss the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for PDH, its steps, or the debate about the rate-controlling step.

所给文献并未包含任何关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)的Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其步骤的信息。该文档似乎是Horiuti和Polanyi 1934年发表的一篇关于氢在金属催化剂上交换反应的文献目录条目，但未提供有关该机理或关于速率控制步骤的持续争论的任何细节。由于所提供的文本中没有相关信息，我无法准确地解释或讨论PDH的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机理、其步骤或关于速率控制步骤的争论。

The provided literature does not contain any information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, propane dehydrogenation, or the specific steps involved in these processes. The document appears to be a bibliographic entry for a paper by Horiuti and Polanyi from 1934, but it does not provide any details about the content of their work or subsequent developments in the field. Therefore, I cannot answer the question based on the given information.
