          [1] "As represented by Horiuti and Polanyi in 1934, LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics is used to describe the mechanism of Pt-catalyzed DH reactions that follow dissociative adsorption of alkane, elimination of the second hydrogen atom and recombinative formation of hydrogen molecules, and desorption of olefin and hydrogen."

[2] "According to most experimental and theoretical calculation results, either the first CH bond cleavage for the adsorbed propane or the second CH bond cleavage is identified as the rate-limiting step."

[3] "The CH cleavage of propane may lead to the formation of 1-, or 2-propyl intermediate in the Pt(111)-catalyzed PDH reaction, whereas the 1-propyl intermediate may be observed in the PDH reaction over PtSn alloy with a down-shifted d-band center relative to pure Pt."

[4] "After the cleavage of the second CH bond, the olefin intermediate adsorbs on the Pt catalysts with π- or di-σ-type binding depending on the catalyst surface property and coverage degree as well as the conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and composition of co-fed gases)"

          The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface and dissociate, forming adsorbed propyl species and hydrogen atoms.

2. β-H extraction: A hydrogen atom is extracted from the β-carbon of the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propylene intermediate.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propylene and hydrogen desorb from the catalyst surface as products.

There is ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction. Some experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the first C-H bond cleavage (dissociative adsorption) is rate-limiting, while others indicate that the second C-H bond cleavage (β-H extraction) is the rate-determining step.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: If dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting, catalyst development should focus on improving the initial C-H bond activation. If β-H extraction is rate-limiting, efforts should concentrate on facilitating the second hydrogen removal.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal reaction conditions may differ depending on which step is rate-controlling, affecting parameters such as temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models require correct identification of the rate-determining step, which impacts the prediction of reaction rates and product distributions.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The uncertainty hinders a complete understanding of the reaction pathway and the factors influencing selectivity and activity.

5. Catalyst characterization: Different rate-limiting steps may require different characterization techniques to probe the relevant surface species and intermediates.

6. Promoter effects: Understanding which step is rate-limiting helps explain how promoters (e.g., Sn in Pt-Sn catalysts) enhance catalytic performance.

This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of the PDH process and emphasizes the need for further research to elucidate the precise reaction mechanism and rate-determining step. Resolving this uncertainty would significantly advance our understanding of the PDH reaction and guide the development of more efficient catalysts and processes.

          Horiuti-Polanyi逆机制描述的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷分子在催化剂表面吸附并解离，形成吸附的丙基物种和氢原子。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种的β碳上提取一个氢原子，形成吸附的丙烯中间体。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯和氢从催化剂表面脱附成为产物。

关于PDH反应中是解离吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤，目前仍存在争议。一些实验和理论研究表明，第一个C-H键断裂（解离吸附）是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则指出第二个C-H键断裂（β-H提取）是速率决定步骤。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：如果解离吸附是速率限制步骤，催化剂开发应该集中于改善初始C-H键活化。如果β-H提取是速率限制步骤，努力应该集中于促进第二个氢的去除。

2. 反应条件：最佳反应条件可能因速率控制步骤的不同而异，影响温度、压力和反应物浓度等参数。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型需要正确识别速率决定步骤，这影响反应速率和产物分布的预测。

4. 机理理解：这种不确定性阻碍了对反应路径及影响选择性和活性因素的完整理解。

5. 催化剂表征：不同的速率限制步骤可能需要不同的表征技术来探测相关的表面物种和中间体。

6. 助剂效应：理解哪一步是速率限制步骤有助于解释助剂（如Pt-Sn催化剂中的Sn）如何增强催化性能。

这个持续的争论突显了PDH过程的复杂性，并强调了需要进一步研究以阐明确切的反应机理和速率决定步骤。解决这个不确定性将显著提高我们对PDH反应的理解，并指导开发更高效的催化剂和工艺。
