          "Recently we [25] studied the adsorption of the possible intermediates and the pathways of propane dissociation on Pt(1 1 1) by density functional theory. The results revealed that propane is physically adsorbed on Pt because the propane molecule has no unpaired electron and cannot bind with Pt atom."

"Trapping-mediated dissociative chemisorption indicated that the gas phase molecule is trapped in the potential field of the surface in the form of alkane, which accommodates to the temperature of the surface [26]. The physically adsorbed molecule may then either desorb or dissociate."

"Jackson et al. [16] studied the dehydrogenation of propane over a chromium catalyst using isotopic labeling techniques coupled to transient flow methods and identified the rate determining step as the elimination of β-hydrogen from propyl radical."

"Biloen et al. [23] studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of π-bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

"Suzuki and Kaneko [24] investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane."

"The model (M3) cannot well describe the experimental results, which is in accordance with the above discussions that the second dehydrogenation, namely propyl dehydrogenation could not be the rate-determining step. However, this is in disagreement with the results of Biloen et al. [23]. The contraversial results were also observed on Cr catalysts [16], [24]. This implies that the rate determining step may be dependent on the structure of the catalyst, e.g. the size and surface orientation."

          The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) consists of three main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption: Propane is physically adsorbed on the catalyst surface and then dissociates into adsorbed propyl and hydrogen species.

2. β-H extraction: A β-hydrogen is extracted from the adsorbed propyl species, forming an adsorbed propene molecule.

3. Desorption: The adsorbed propene molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface.

There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding which step is the rate-controlling step in the PDH reaction. Some studies, such as those by Jackson et al. and Biloen et al., identified the β-hydrogen elimination as the rate-determining step. However, Suzuki and Kaneko proposed that the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane (which could be interpreted as part of the dissociative adsorption step) was rate-determining.

Recent density functional theory studies suggest that propane is only physically adsorbed on Pt surfaces, which could imply that dissociative adsorption might be rate-limiting.

This uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process in several ways:

1. Catalyst design: Different rate-limiting steps would require different catalyst optimization strategies.

2. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations may vary depending on which step is rate-limiting.

3. Kinetic modeling: Accurate kinetic models are crucial for process design and optimization, and they depend on correctly identifying the rate-determining step.

4. Mechanistic understanding: The debate highlights gaps in our fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism on different catalyst surfaces.

5. Interpretation of experimental data: Depending on which step is assumed to be rate-controlling, experimental data may be interpreted differently, leading to potentially conflicting conclusions.

The literature suggests that the rate-determining step may be dependent on the catalyst structure, including particle size and surface orientation. This complexity underscores the need for further research to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the PDH process across different catalyst systems and reaction conditions.

          反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制的丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程包括三个主要步骤：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷在催化剂表面物理吸附，然后解离成吸附的丙基和氢物种。

2. β-H提取：从吸附的丙基物种中提取一个β-氢，形成吸附的丙烯分子。

3. 脱附：吸附的丙烯分子从催化剂表面脱附。

科学界对PDH反应中哪一步是速率控制步骤存在持续争议。一些研究，如Jackson等人和Biloen等人的研究，将β-氢消除确定为速率决定步骤。然而，Suzuki和Kaneko提出，吸附丙烷的脱氢（可以解释为解离吸附步骤的一部分）是速率决定步骤。

最近的密度泛函理论研究表明，丙烷在Pt表面上只是物理吸附，这可能意味着解离吸附可能是限速步骤。

这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 催化剂设计：不同的限速步骤会需要不同的催化剂优化策略。

2. 反应条件：最佳温度、压力和反应物浓度可能会因限速步骤的不同而变化。

3. 动力学建模：准确的动力学模型对过程设计和优化至关重要，它们取决于正确识别速率决定步骤。

4. 机理理解：这场争论凸显了我们对不同催化剂表面上反应机理的基本理解存在差距。

5. 实验数据解释：根据假定的速率控制步骤的不同，实验数据可能会被不同地解释，导致可能相互矛盾的结论。

文献表明，速率决定步骤可能取决于催化剂结构，包括粒子大小和表面取向。这种复杂性强调了需要进一步研究，以在不同催化剂系统和反应条件下对PDH过程发展更全面的理解。
