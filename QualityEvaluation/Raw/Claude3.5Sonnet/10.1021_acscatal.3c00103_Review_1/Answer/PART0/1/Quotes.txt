"Recently we [25] studied the adsorption of the possible intermediates and the pathways of propane dissociation on Pt(1 1 1) by density functional theory. The results revealed that propane is physically adsorbed on Pt because the propane molecule has no unpaired electron and cannot bind with Pt atom."

"Trapping-mediated dissociative chemisorption indicated that the gas phase molecule is trapped in the potential field of the surface in the form of alkane, which accommodates to the temperature of the surface [26]. The physically adsorbed molecule may then either desorb or dissociate."

"Jackson et al. [16] studied the dehydrogenation of propane over a chromium catalyst using isotopic labeling techniques coupled to transient flow methods and identified the rate determining step as the elimination of β-hydrogen from propyl radical."

"Biloen et al. [23] studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of π-bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

"Suzuki and Kaneko [24] investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane."

"The model (M3) cannot well describe the experimental results, which is in accordance with the above discussions that the second dehydrogenation, namely propyl dehydrogenation could not be the rate-determining step. However, this is in disagreement with the results of Biloen et al. [23]. The contraversial results were also observed on Cr catalysts [16], [24]. This implies that the rate determining step may be dependent on the structure of the catalyst, e.g. the size and surface orientation."

"The elementary steps involved in the dehydrogenation an alkane over a platinum catalyst are: dissociative adsorption of the alkane into an adsorbed hydrogen atom and alkyl group; elimination of second hydrogen from platinum atom bonded alkyl group; followed by desorption of the resulting alkene and recombination of the hydrogen atoms and desorption as a hydrogen molecule. The dissociative adsorption of the alkane substrate involves two platinum atoms and it is the rate-limiting step. The step is irreversible but the remaining steps are reversible"

[1] "It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism."

[2] "The dehydrogenation steps from propane to propylene is shown in Fig. 28(a) (steps 14), and the energy barriers for these four steps can describe the catalytic activity of metal surfaces for propylene production."

[3] "Both the first and second CH bond activations of propane have been suggested as the RDSs."

[4] "The initial CH bond cleavage at the methyl (step 1) or methylene (step 2) groups of physisorbed propane is often the RDS that governs the rate law of the overall dehydrogenation reaction, leading to the 1-propyl or 2-propyl species."

[5] "The experimental354 and theoretical analyses of Gibbs energy profiles of the PDH reaction340,353 suggest that the first CH bond activation is the RDS on Pt(211) and Pt(100) for smaller Pt cluster sizes, while the second CH bond activation is the RDS on Pt(111)."

[6] "The first CH activation of propane was identified as the RDS on the Pt(111) by a microkinetic analysis."

[7] "Recently, however, Xiao et al. suggested that although PDH over Pt(111) follows the generally accepted reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, as shown in Fig. 29, an unexpected non-reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism over Pt(211) is proposed to dominate the kinetics."

[1] "Based on the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process"

          [2] "The combined results from hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can be explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below"

[1] "As represented by Horiuti and Polanyi in 1934, LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics is used to describe the mechanism of Pt-catalyzed DH reactions that follow dissociative adsorption of alkane, elimination of the second hydrogen atom and recombinative formation of hydrogen molecules, and desorption of olefin and hydrogen."

[2] "According to most experimental and theoretical calculation results, either the first CH bond cleavage for the adsorbed propane or the second CH bond cleavage is identified as the rate-limiting step."

[3] "The CH cleavage of propane may lead to the formation of 1-, or 2-propyl intermediate in the Pt(111)-catalyzed PDH reaction, whereas the 1-propyl intermediate may be observed in the PDH reaction over PtSn alloy with a down-shifted d-band center relative to pure Pt."

[4] "After the cleavage of the second CH bond, the olefin intermediate adsorbs on the Pt catalysts with π- or di-σ-type binding depending on the catalyst surface property and coverage degree as well as the conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and composition of co-fed gases)"

[1] "It is proposed that propane dehydrogenation over platinum and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, namely, dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom to which two adsorption sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen atom."

          [2] "The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining."

          [3] "The last step, desorption of π-bonded propene, has a comparatively low activation energy."

          [4] "For both platinum and the alloys, activation energies of some 29  2 kcal/mole were measured. The reaction rate order in hydrogen, however, is different."

[1] "As noted above, the combined results from reaction kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below (Cortright et al., 1996)"

[2] "On the basis of the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process (Cortright et al., 1996). A similar conclusion was reached by Lok et al. (1986) in their investigation of isobutane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported Pt/Sn catalysts."

[3] "Therefore, we may assume that steps 24 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study, leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenationdehydrogenation reactions:"

[1] "The reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2."

          [2] "However, whether the dissociative adsorption process or the extraction of the β-H is the rate-controlling step of PDH process remains to be confirmed."
