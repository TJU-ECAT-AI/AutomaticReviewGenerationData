          [1] "The dehydrogenation of propane and the hydrogenation of propylene were kinetically investigated over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts."
          [2] "It was concluded that the rate determining step of the reaction was (C3H8)a  (C3H6)a + (H2)a."

          The provided literature does not contain detailed information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption). The document only mentions a kinetic investigation of propane dehydrogenation over chromia-alumina-potassium oxide catalysts. It concludes that the rate-determining step of the reaction was (C3H8)a  (C3H6)a + (H2)a, which represents the overall dehydrogenation reaction of propane to propylene and hydrogen.

          The literature does not discuss the ongoing debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. It also does not provide information on how this uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process.

          Given the limited information in the provided text, a comprehensive answer to the question cannot be formulated based solely on this literature. To properly address the question, additional sources discussing the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, its steps, and the current debates in the field would be necessary.

          提供的文献中没有关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制或其三个步骤（解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附）的详细信息。该文档仅提到了在氧化铬-氧化铝-氧化钾催化剂上对丙烷脱氢进行的动力学研究。它得出结论，反应的速率决定步骤是(C3H8)a  (C3H6)a + (H2)a，这代表了丙烷脱氢成丙烯和氢的整体反应。

          文献没有讨论关于解离吸附或β-H提取是否为速率控制步骤的持续争论。它也没有提供这种不确定性如何影响我们对PDH过程理解的信息。

          鉴于提供的文本中信息有限，仅基于这份文献无法形成对该问题的全面回答。要正确回答这个问题，需要额外的资料来讨论反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制、其步骤以及该领域目前的争论。
