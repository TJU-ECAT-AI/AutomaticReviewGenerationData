If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

I apologize, but I cannot provide a detailed answer to this question based on the given literature. The provided text appears to be a generic website content notice rather than scientific information about propane dehydrogenation or the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. The literature does not contain any relevant information to address the specifics of the question regarding the steps of the mechanism, the debate over the rate-controlling step, or how this uncertainty impacts our understanding of the PDH process.

To properly answer this question, we would need access to scientific literature specifically discussing the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation, including details about its steps and current research on rate-controlling factors.

很抱歉，我无法根据给定的文献对这个问题提供详细的回答。提供的文本似乎是一个通用网站内容通知，而不是关于丙烷脱氢或逆霍里乌蒂-波兰伊机理的科学信息。文献中不包含任何相关信息来解答有关该机理步骤、速率控制步骤争论或这种不确定性如何影响我们对PDH过程理解的具体问题。

要正确回答这个问题，我们需要获取专门讨论丙烷脱氢逆霍里乌蒂-波兰伊机理的科学文献，包括其步骤的详细信息以及当前关于速率控制因素的研究。
