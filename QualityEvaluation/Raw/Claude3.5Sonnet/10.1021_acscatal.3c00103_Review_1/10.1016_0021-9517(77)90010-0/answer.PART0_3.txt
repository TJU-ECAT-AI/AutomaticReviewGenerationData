[1] "It is proposed that propane dehydrogenation over platinum and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, namely, dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom to which two adsorption sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen atom."

[2] "The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining."

[3] "The last step, desorption of π-bonded propene, has a comparatively low activation energy."

The literature does not explicitly mention the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or provide a detailed explanation of its three steps. However, it does describe a similar process for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) over platinum and platinum-gold alloys.

The mechanism described in the literature involves:
1. Dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom
2. Conversion of propyl radical to π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination
3. Desorption of π-bonded propene

The literature suggests that the β-hydrogen elimination step is rate-determining, rather than the dissociative adsorption process. This contradicts the ongoing debate mentioned in the question about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step.

The literature does not discuss the uncertainty in determining the rate-controlling step or its impact on our understanding of the PDH process. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, we cannot comment on the debate or its implications for PDH understanding.

该文献没有明确提到反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制，也没有详细解释其三个步骤。但是，它确实描述了一个类似的过程，即在铂和铂-金合金上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）。

文献中描述的机制包括：
1. 丙烷在单个铂原子上的解离化学吸附
2. 通过β-氢消除将丙基自由基转化为π键合的丙烯
3. π键合丙烯的脱附

文献表明，β-氢消除步骤是决定速率的步骤，而不是解离吸附过程。这与问题中提到的关于解离吸附过程或β-H提取是否为速率控制步骤的持续争论相矛盾。

文献没有讨论确定速率控制步骤的不确定性或其对我们理解PDH过程的影响。因此，仅基于所提供的文本，我们无法评论这一争论或其对PDH理解的影响。
