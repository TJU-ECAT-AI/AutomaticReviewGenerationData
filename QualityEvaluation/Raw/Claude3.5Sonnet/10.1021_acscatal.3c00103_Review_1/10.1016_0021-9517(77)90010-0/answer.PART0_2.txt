[1] "It is proposed that propane dehydrogenation over platinum and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, namely, dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom to which two adsorption sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen atom."

[2] "The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining."

[3] "The last step, desorption of π-bonded propene, has a comparatively low activation energy."

The literature does not explicitly mention the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or provide a detailed explanation of its three steps. However, it does describe a similar process for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) over platinum and platinum-gold alloys.

Based on the information provided, the PDH process involves:

1. Dissociative chemisorption of propane on a platinum atom
2. β-hydrogen elimination to form π-bonded propene
3. Desorption of π-bonded propene

The literature suggests that the β-hydrogen elimination step is rate-determining, stating that it "appears to be rate determining." This contradicts the question's implication of an ongoing debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step.

The document does not discuss any uncertainty or debate regarding the rate-controlling step, nor does it address how such uncertainty might impact our understanding of the PDH process. Therefore, it is not possible to critically discuss this aspect based solely on the provided literature.

该文献并未明确提及反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制，也没有详细解释其三个步骤。然而，它确实描述了在铂和铂金合金上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）的类似过程。

根据所提供的信息，PDH过程包括：

1. 丙烷在铂原子上的解离化学吸附
2. β-氢消除形成π键合的丙烯
3. π键合丙烯的脱附

文献暗示β-氢消除步骤是速率决定步骤，称其"似乎是速率决定的"。这与问题中暗示的关于解离吸附或β-H提取哪个是速率控制步骤的持续争论相矛盾。

文档没有讨论关于速率控制步骤的任何不确定性或争论，也没有涉及这种不确定性如何影响我们对PDH过程的理解。因此，仅根据提供的文献无法对这一方面进行批判性讨论。
