Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

[1] "For both platinum and the alloys, activation energies of some 29  2 kcal/mole were measured. The reaction rate order in hydrogen, however, is different."

[2] "It is proposed that propane dehydrogenation over platinum and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, namely, dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom to which two adsorption sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen atom."

[3] "The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining."

[4] "The last step, desorption of π-bonded propene, has a comparatively low activation energy."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not explicitly discuss the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does describe a similar mechanism for PDH over platinum and platinum-gold alloys. 

The mechanism described in the literature involves three steps that are similar to the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism:

1. Dissociative adsorption: The propane molecule is dissociatively chemisorbed on a single platinum atom with two adsorption sites, one of which carries a hydrogen atom.

2. β-H extraction: The propyl radical formed from the dissociative adsorption is converted into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination.

3. Desorption: The π-bonded propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

According to the literature, the β-hydrogen elimination step appears to be rate-determining, with an activation energy of about 29 ± 2 kcal/mole for both platinum and platinum-gold alloys. The desorption step is described as having a comparatively low activation energy.

The literature does not discuss an ongoing debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. Instead, it presents β-hydrogen elimination as the rate-determining step. This implies that the uncertainty mentioned in the question is not addressed in this specific study.

The impact of this uncertainty on our understanding of the PDH process cannot be directly inferred from the given literature, as it focuses on a specific mechanistic interpretation rather than discussing alternative viewpoints or their implications.

该文献并未明确讨论丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制。然而，它确实描述了一个类似的机制，适用于铂和铂金合金上的PDH反应。

文献中描述的机制包括三个步骤，类似于逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷分子在单个铂原子上解离化学吸附，该铂原子有两个吸附位点，其中一个带有氢原子。

2. β-H提取：通过解离吸附形成的丙基自由基通过β-氢消除转化为π键合的丙烯。

3. 脱附：π键合的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

根据文献，β-氢消除步骤似乎是速率决定步骤，对于铂和铂金合金，其活化能约为29 ± 2 kcal/mole。脱附步骤被描述为具有相对较低的活化能。

文献并未讨论关于解离吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的持续争论。相反，它将β-氢消除作为速率决定步骤。这意味着问题中提到的不确定性在这项具体研究中并未被涉及。

从给定的文献中无法直接推断这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程的影响，因为它专注于特定的机制解释，而不是讨论替代观点或其含义。

The provided literature does not explicitly discuss the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does describe a similar mechanism for PDH over platinum and platinum-gold alloys. Based on the information given, the mechanism consists of three steps:

1. Dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom with two adsorption sites, one of which already carries a hydrogen atom.

2. Conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination.

3. Desorption of π-bonded propene.

The literature suggests that the β-hydrogen elimination step (step 2) is rate-determining, as it states "The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining." This contradicts the ongoing debate mentioned in the question about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step.

The uncertainty regarding the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process by affecting how we approach catalyst design and process optimization. If β-H extraction is indeed the rate-limiting step, as suggested by this study, efforts to improve PDH efficiency should focus on facilitating this step rather than the dissociative adsorption step.

It's important to note that this study focuses specifically on platinum and platinum-gold alloy catalysts, and the findings may not be generalizable to all PDH processes or catalysts. The ongoing debate in the wider scientific community suggests that the rate-controlling step may vary depending on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions used.

虽然所提供的文献没有明确讨论丙烷脱氢（PDH）的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制，但它确实描述了在铂和铂金合金上进行PDH的类似机制。根据给出的信息，该机制包括三个步骤：

1. 丙烷在单个铂原子上进行解离化学吸附，该原子有两个吸附位点，其中一个已经携带一个氢原子。

2. 通过β-氢消除将丙基自由基转化为π键合的丙烯。

3. π键合丙烯的脱附。

文献表明，β-氢消除步骤（步骤2）是速率决定步骤，因为它指出"通过β-氢消除将丙基自由基转化为π键合丙烯的后续过程似乎是速率决定性的。"这与问题中提到的关于解离吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的持续争论相矛盾。

关于速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响我们如何进行催化剂设计和过程优化。如果β-H提取确实是速率限制步骤，如本研究所示，那么提高PDH效率的努力应该集中在促进这一步骤，而不是解离吸附步骤。

需要注意的是，这项研究特别关注铂和铂金合金催化剂，其发现可能不能推广到所有PDH过程或催化剂。更广泛的科学界中持续的争论表明，速率控制步骤可能会因所使用的具体催化剂和反应条件而有所不同。

The literature does not explicitly mention the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or provide a detailed explanation of its three steps. However, it does describe a similar process for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) over platinum and platinum-gold alloys.

Based on the information provided, the PDH process involves:

1. Dissociative chemisorption of propane on a platinum atom
2. β-hydrogen elimination to form π-bonded propene
3. Desorption of π-bonded propene

The literature suggests that the β-hydrogen elimination step is rate-determining, stating that it "appears to be rate determining." This contradicts the question's implication of an ongoing debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step.

The document does not discuss any uncertainty or debate regarding the rate-controlling step, nor does it address how such uncertainty might impact our understanding of the PDH process. Therefore, it is not possible to critically discuss this aspect based solely on the provided literature.

该文献并未明确提及反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制，也没有详细解释其三个步骤。然而，它确实描述了在铂和铂金合金上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）的类似过程。

根据所提供的信息，PDH过程包括：

1. 丙烷在铂原子上的解离化学吸附
2. β-氢消除形成π键合的丙烯
3. π键合丙烯的脱附

文献暗示β-氢消除步骤是速率决定步骤，称其"似乎是速率决定的"。这与问题中暗示的关于解离吸附或β-H提取哪个是速率控制步骤的持续争论相矛盾。

文档没有讨论关于速率控制步骤的任何不确定性或争论，也没有涉及这种不确定性如何影响我们对PDH过程的理解。因此，仅根据提供的文献无法对这一方面进行批判性讨论。

It's important to note that this study focuses on platinum and platinum-gold alloys, which may not represent all PDH catalysts. The debate likely continues because different catalysts or reaction conditions may result in different rate-controlling steps.
