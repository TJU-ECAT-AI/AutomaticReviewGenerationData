[1] "For both platinum and the alloys, activation energies of some 29  2 kcal/mole were measured. The reaction rate order in hydrogen, however, is different."

[2] "It is proposed that propane dehydrogenation over platinum and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, namely, dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom to which two adsorption sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen atom."

[4] "The last step, desorption of π-bonded propene, has a comparatively low activation energy."

The literature does not directly discuss the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does describe a similar mechanism for PDH over platinum and platinum-gold alloys. 

Based on the information provided, the mechanism consists of three steps:

1. Dissociative chemisorption: Propane is dissociatively adsorbed on a single platinum atom with two adsorption sites, one of which already carries a hydrogen atom.

2. β-Hydrogen elimination: The adsorbed propyl radical is converted into π-bonded propene through β-hydrogen elimination.

3. Desorption: π-bonded propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

The literature suggests that the β-hydrogen elimination step is rate-determining, as stated: "The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining." This contradicts the ongoing debate mentioned in the question about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step.

The uncertainty in determining the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process by affecting how we interpret kinetic data, design catalysts, and optimize reaction conditions. Different rate-controlling steps would lead to different strategies for improving catalyst performance and reaction efficiency.

It's important to note that this study focuses on platinum and platinum-gold alloys, which may not represent all PDH catalysts. The debate likely continues because different catalysts or reaction conditions may result in different rate-controlling steps.

虽然文献没有直接讨论丙烷脱氢(PDH)的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制，但它确实描述了在铂和铂金合金上进行PDH的类似机制。

根据提供的信息，该机制包括三个步骤：

1. 解离化学吸附：丙烷在单个铂原子上解离吸附，该原子有两个吸附位点，其中一个已经携带氢原子。

2. β-氢消除：吸附的丙基自由基通过β-氢消除转化为π键合的丙烯。

3. 脱附：π键合的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

文献表明β-氢消除步骤是速率决定步骤，如文中所述："丙基自由基通过β-氢消除转化为π键合丙烯的后续过程似乎是速率决定步骤。"这与问题中提到的关于解离吸附或β-H提取是否为速率控制步骤的持续争论相矛盾。

确定速率控制步骤的不确定性影响我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响我们如何解释动力学数据、设计催化剂和优化反应条件。不同的速率控制步骤将导致不同的催化剂性能改进和反应效率优化策略。

需要注意的是，这项研究集中在铂和铂金合金上，可能并不代表所有PDH催化剂。争论可能仍在继续，因为不同的催化剂或反应条件可能导致不同的速率控制步骤。
