[1] "For both platinum and the alloys, activation energies of some 29  2 kcal/mole were measured. The reaction rate order in hydrogen, however, is different."

[2] "It is proposed that propane dehydrogenation over platinum and over the alloys occurs via the same reaction mechanism, namely, dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom to which two adsorption sites are associated, one of which carries a hydrogen atom."

The literature does not explicitly discuss the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does describe a similar mechanism for PDH over platinum and platinum-gold alloys. 

The mechanism described in the literature involves three steps that are similar to the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism:

1. Dissociative adsorption: The propane molecule is dissociatively chemisorbed on a single platinum atom with two adsorption sites, one of which carries a hydrogen atom.

2. β-H extraction: The propyl radical formed from the dissociative adsorption is converted into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination.

3. Desorption: The π-bonded propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

According to the literature, the β-hydrogen elimination step appears to be rate-determining, with an activation energy of about 29 ± 2 kcal/mole for both platinum and platinum-gold alloys. The desorption step is described as having a comparatively low activation energy.

The literature does not discuss an ongoing debate about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step. Instead, it presents β-hydrogen elimination as the rate-determining step. This implies that the uncertainty mentioned in the question is not addressed in this specific study.

The impact of this uncertainty on our understanding of the PDH process cannot be directly inferred from the given literature, as it focuses on a specific mechanistic interpretation rather than discussing alternative viewpoints or their implications.

该文献并未明确讨论丙烷脱氢（PDH）的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制。然而，它确实描述了一个类似的机制，适用于铂和铂金合金上的PDH反应。

文献中描述的机制包括三个步骤，类似于逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制：

1. 解离吸附：丙烷分子在单个铂原子上解离化学吸附，该铂原子有两个吸附位点，其中一个带有氢原子。

2. β-H提取：通过解离吸附形成的丙基自由基通过β-氢消除转化为π键合的丙烯。

3. 脱附：π键合的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

根据文献，β-氢消除步骤似乎是速率决定步骤，对于铂和铂金合金，其活化能约为29 ± 2 kcal/mole。脱附步骤被描述为具有相对较低的活化能。

文献并未讨论关于解离吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的持续争论。相反，它将β-氢消除作为速率决定步骤。这意味着问题中提到的不确定性在这项具体研究中并未被涉及。

从给定的文献中无法直接推断这种不确定性对我们理解PDH过程的影响，因为它专注于特定的机制解释，而不是讨论替代观点或其含义。
