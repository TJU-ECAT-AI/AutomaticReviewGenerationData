The provided literature does not explicitly discuss the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does describe a similar mechanism for PDH over platinum and platinum-gold alloys. Based on the information given, the mechanism consists of three steps:

1. Dissociative chemisorption of propane on a single platinum atom with two adsorption sites, one of which already carries a hydrogen atom.

2. Conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination.

3. Desorption of π-bonded propene.

The literature suggests that the β-hydrogen elimination step (step 2) is rate-determining, as it states "The subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination appears to be rate determining." This contradicts the ongoing debate mentioned in the question about whether dissociative adsorption or β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step.

The uncertainty regarding the rate-controlling step impacts our understanding of the PDH process by affecting how we approach catalyst design and process optimization. If β-H extraction is indeed the rate-limiting step, as suggested by this study, efforts to improve PDH efficiency should focus on facilitating this step rather than the dissociative adsorption step.

It's important to note that this study focuses specifically on platinum and platinum-gold alloy catalysts, and the findings may not be generalizable to all PDH processes or catalysts. The ongoing debate in the wider scientific community suggests that the rate-controlling step may vary depending on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions used.

虽然所提供的文献没有明确讨论丙烷脱氢（PDH）的反向Horiuti-Polanyi机制，但它确实描述了在铂和铂金合金上进行PDH的类似机制。根据给出的信息，该机制包括三个步骤：

1. 丙烷在单个铂原子上进行解离化学吸附，该原子有两个吸附位点，其中一个已经携带一个氢原子。

2. 通过β-氢消除将丙基自由基转化为π键合的丙烯。

3. π键合丙烯的脱附。

文献表明，β-氢消除步骤（步骤2）是速率决定步骤，因为它指出"通过β-氢消除将丙基自由基转化为π键合丙烯的后续过程似乎是速率决定性的。"这与问题中提到的关于解离吸附还是β-H提取是速率控制步骤的持续争论相矛盾。

关于速率控制步骤的不确定性影响了我们对PDH过程的理解，因为它影响我们如何进行催化剂设计和过程优化。如果β-H提取确实是速率限制步骤，如本研究所示，那么提高PDH效率的努力应该集中在促进这一步骤，而不是解离吸附步骤。

需要注意的是，这项研究特别关注铂和铂金合金催化剂，其发现可能不能推广到所有PDH过程或催化剂。更广泛的科学界中持续的争论表明，速率控制步骤可能会因所使用的具体催化剂和反应条件而有所不同。
