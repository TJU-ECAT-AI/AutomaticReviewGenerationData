The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism plays a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation, a process of significant industrial importance for producing propylene. This mechanism consists of three distinct steps: first, the adsorption of propane onto the catalyst surface; second, the breaking of a C-H bond to form an alkyl intermediate; and third, the elimination of a second hydrogen atom to yield propylene. While these steps are well-established, there is ongoing debate among researchers regarding which step is rate-controlling. Some studies suggest that the initial C-H bond activation is the slowest and therefore rate-determining, while others argue that the final hydrogen elimination step is the limiting factor. This controversy has led to extensive research efforts, employing advanced spectroscopic techniques and computational modeling to elucidate the kinetics and energetics of each step. Understanding the rate-controlling step is crucial for optimizing catalyst design and reaction conditions, potentially leading to more efficient and economical propylene production processes.
