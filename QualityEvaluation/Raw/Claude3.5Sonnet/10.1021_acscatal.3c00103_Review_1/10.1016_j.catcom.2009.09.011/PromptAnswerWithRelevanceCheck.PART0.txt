Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Explain the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), detailing its three steps (dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption), and critically discuss the ongoing debate regarding whether the dissociative adsorption process or the β-H extraction is the rate-controlling step in this reaction. How does this uncertainty impact our understanding of the PDH process?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on isobutane dehydrogenation over VMgOx catalysts in the presence of carbon dioxide, and does not mention propane dehydrogenation or the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. The literature does not provide information about the three steps of dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption, nor does it discuss any debate regarding the rate-controlling step in PDH. As such, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

所提供的文献中没有讨论丙烷脱氢(PDH)的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制。该文档主要关注在二氧化碳存在下VMgOx催化剂上的异丁烷脱氢,并未提及丙烷脱氢或Horiuti-Polanyi机制。文献没有提供关于解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附这三个步骤的信息,也没有讨论PDH中速率控制步骤的任何争论。因此,无法根据提供的文档回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or its specific steps. The document primarily focuses on isobutane dehydrogenation using carbon dioxide over a VMgOx catalyst. It does not discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, propane dehydrogenation, or the debate regarding the rate-controlling step in PDH. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided literature.
