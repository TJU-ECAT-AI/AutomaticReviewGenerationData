The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on isobutane dehydrogenation over VMgOx catalysts in the presence of carbon dioxide, and does not mention propane dehydrogenation or the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. The literature does not provide information about the three steps of dissociative adsorption, β-H extraction, and desorption, nor does it discuss any debate regarding the rate-controlling step in PDH. As such, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

所提供的文献中没有讨论丙烷脱氢(PDH)的逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制。该文档主要关注在二氧化碳存在下VMgOx催化剂上的异丁烷脱氢,并未提及丙烷脱氢或Horiuti-Polanyi机制。文献没有提供关于解离吸附、β-H提取和脱附这三个步骤的信息,也没有讨论PDH中速率控制步骤的任何争论。因此,无法根据提供的文档回答这个问题。
