Bimetallic catalysts have emerged as powerful tools in various important catalytic reactions, offering enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability compared to their monometallic counterparts. A comprehensive overview of these catalysts in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions reveals their significant potential for industrial applications. In CO oxidation, bimetallic catalysts such as Au-Pd and Pt-Co have demonstrated superior performance, with synergistic effects between the metals leading to improved reaction rates and lower activation energies. The water gas shift reaction, crucial for hydrogen production, benefits from bimetallic catalysts like Cu-Zn and Pt-Re, which exhibit increased resistance to sintering and enhanced activity across a wider temperature range. Methane conversions, including steam reforming and dry reforming, have shown remarkable improvements with bimetallic catalysts such as Ni-Co and Rh-Pt, offering better coke resistance and higher conversion rates. Reactor studies of these reactions have provided valuable insights into reaction mechanisms, catalyst stability, and optimal operating conditions. These findings have significant implications for future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) research on model surfaces and supported catalysts, as they highlight the need for in-depth investigations into the atomic-scale interactions between metal components and their effects on catalytic performance. Such studies could lead to the rational design of more efficient bimetallic catalysts, tailored for specific reactions and industrial processes.
