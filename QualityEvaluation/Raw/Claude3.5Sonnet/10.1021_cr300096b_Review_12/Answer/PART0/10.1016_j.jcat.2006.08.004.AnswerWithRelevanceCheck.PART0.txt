          [1] "When the bimetallic PtRu/SiO2 catalyst was directly reduced in H2 at 300C, its catalytic behavior was similar to that of monometallic Ru/SiO2 pretreated under similar conditions."

[2] "In contrast, when the same bimetallic catalyst underwent O2/H2 treatment at 300C, a delay of approximately 30C was observed in the CO light-off temperature."

[3] "Such a delay, signifying decreased CO oxidation activity, can be related to a decreased fraction of Ru sites available on the surface of this sample, because the FTIR data suggest that the surface of the metal nanoparticles formed after such treatment is enriched with Pt."

[4] "Given the relatively small fraction of exposed Ru sites, we should also consider that the bimetallic interaction between Pt and Ru may have substantially enhanced the activity of Pt for PROX."

[5] "Such an enhancement can be attributed to the lower strength of CO adsorption, as indicated by the FTIR measurements."

[6] "The FTIR results indicate that the adsorption of CO was substantially weaker on bimetallic samples than on the corresponding monometallic ones."

[7] "Our results indicate that regardless of the pretreatment conditions, the CO adsorbed on the Pt sites of the PtRu/SiO2 samples (band at approximately 2070 cm1) is weakly bound to the surface."

[8] "The results indicate that the presence of Pt stabilizes Ru and prevents its sintering during exposure to oxidizing conditions. Furthermore, the strength of the CO adsorption on the bimetallic samples is lower than that on the monometallic counterparts, presumably due to the presence of bimetallic interactions between Pt and Ru."

[9] "Complete conversion of CO was never achieved with the PtRu/SiO2 sample that underwent O2/H2 treatment at 300C. As shown in Fig. 4, the CO conversion decreased immediately after reaching its maximum value of approximately 95% at 140C. Once again, this may be due to the decrease strength of CO adsorption, at elevated temperatures."

[10] "The high activity and selectivity of these monometallic catalysts in PROX is often related to the saturation of metal surfaces by CO, which prevents H2 adsorption and oxidation"

[11] "The lower strength of CO adsorption in the case of the PtRu sample could promote the oxidation of CO on Pt."

          Bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in several ways:

1. Pretreatment conditions affect catalyst performance:
   - H2 reduction leads to behavior similar to monometallic Ru.
   - O2/H2 treatment results in Pt-enriched surfaces with improved activity over monometallic Pt.

2. Bimetallic interactions weaken CO adsorption:
   - CO adsorption is weaker on bimetallic samples compared to monometallic counterparts.
   - Weakened CO adsorption promotes CO oxidation on Pt sites by freeing up active sites for O2 adsorption and reaction.

3. Surface composition impacts activity:
   - O2/H2 treatment enriches the surface with Pt, reducing available Ru sites.
   - Despite fewer Ru sites, activity is enhanced due to Pt-Ru interactions.

4. Pt stabilizes Ru and prevents sintering under oxidizing conditions.

5. Temperature effects:
   - Complete CO conversion is not achieved, with conversion decreasing after reaching a maximum (around 95% at 140°C).
   - This may be due to weaker CO adsorption at elevated temperatures, allowing increased H2 oxidation.

6. The bimetallic catalyst shows improved activity for preferential oxidation of CO (PROX) compared to monometallic Pt.

The literature does not provide information on water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. Regarding potential UHV studies, they could provide insights by:

1. Directly observing CO adsorption strengths on model PtRu surfaces with varying compositions.
2. Investigating the effect of different pretreatments on surface segregation and reactivity.
3. Correlating surface structure and composition with catalytic activity.
4. Examining the influence of PtRu interactions on O2 activation and reaction mechanisms.

These UHV studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing fundamental understanding of the bimetallic effects observed in reactor studies. However, preparing well-defined bimetallic surfaces in UHV and bridging the materials gap remain challenges.

          Pt-Ru双金属催化剂通过以下几种方式影响CO氧化机理和效率：

1. 预处理条件影响催化剂性能：
   - H2还原导致行为类似于单金属Ru。
   - O2/H2处理结果是富Pt表面，其活性优于单金属Pt。

2. 双金属相互作用减弱CO吸附：
   - 与单金属催化剂相比，CO在双金属样品上的吸附较弱。
   - 减弱的CO吸附通过释放活性位点促进Pt位点上的CO氧化，为O2吸附和反应提供空间。

3. 表面组成影响活性：
   - O2/H2处理使表面富集Pt，减少可用的Ru位点。
   - 尽管Ru位点较少，但由于Pt-Ru相互作用，活性得到提高。

4. Pt稳定Ru并防止其在氧化条件下烧结。

5. 温度效应：
   - 无法达到完全CO转化，转化率在达到最大值后开始下降（约140°C时95%）。
   - 这可能是由于在较高温度下CO吸附减弱，允许增加H2氧化。

6. 与单金属Pt相比，双金属催化剂对CO优先氧化（PROX）的活性有所提高。

文献没有提供关于水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化的信息。关于潜在的UHV研究，它们可以通过以下方式提供洞见：

1. 直接观察不同组成的模型PtRu表面上的CO吸附强度。
2. 研究不同预处理对表面偏析和反应性的影响。
3. 将表面结构和组成与催化活性相关联。
4. 检查PtRu相互作用对O2活化和反应机理的影响。

这些UHV研究可以帮助桥接模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距，为反应器研究中观察到的双金属效应提供基本理解。然而，在UHV中制备良好定义的双金属表面以及弥合材料差距仍然是挑战。
