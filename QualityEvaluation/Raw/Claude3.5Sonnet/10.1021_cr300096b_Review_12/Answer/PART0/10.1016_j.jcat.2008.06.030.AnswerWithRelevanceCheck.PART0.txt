          [1] "Pt-based intermetallic compounds (IMCs) supported on silica were studied as a catalyst for the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess hydrogen to obtain the active catalyst at low temperatures."

[2] "Pt3Co/SiO2 and PtCu/SiO2 were more active than Pt/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 in the temperature range of 373453 K."

[3] "Infrared (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and adsorption measurements revealed a significant electron transfer from Pt atoms to Co or Cu atoms. The electron-deficient Pt atoms adsorbed CO weakly compared with Pt metal, accelerating the adsorption of oxygen on the IMC surface."

[4] "Kinetic studies indicated that Co and Cu atoms in IMCs also adsorb oxygen. This improved oxygen adsorption likely resulted in the high PROX activity at low temperatures."

[5] "The reaction proceeded through the LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism, as has been proposed on PtFe/mordenite"

[6] "On PtCu/SiO2, however, CO conversion increased by 30% with the addition of hydrogen and even further by the addition of water. The enhancing effect of hydrogen reflected the contribution of water produced by the oxidation of hydrogen during the PROX reaction."

[7] "The CO molecules on Pt would be oxidized by oxygen atoms activated on Co, resulting in higher activity of Pt3Co compared with Pt metal."

          Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly intermetallic compounds (IMCs) like Pt3Co and PtCu, significantly influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in reactor studies. These catalysts show higher activity than pure Pt catalysts at lower temperatures (373-453 K) for preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess hydrogen.

The enhanced performance of these bimetallic catalysts is attributed to several factors:

1. Electronic effects: Electron transfer from Pt to Co or Cu atoms results in electron-deficient Pt atoms that adsorb CO more weakly than pure Pt, facilitating oxygen adsorption.

2. Improved oxygen adsorption: Co and Cu atoms in the IMCs also adsorb oxygen, contributing to higher PROX activity at low temperatures.

3. Reaction mechanism: The reaction proceeds through a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, differing from the Rideal mechanism observed on pure Pt surfaces.

4. Synergistic effects: On Pt3Co, CO adsorbed on Pt is oxidized by oxygen atoms activated on Co sites, resulting in higher activity compared to pure Pt.

5. Hydrogen and water effects: For PtCu catalysts, the presence of hydrogen and water significantly enhances CO conversion. The addition of hydrogen increases CO conversion by 30%, with further enhancement by water addition. This effect is attributed to the water produced during the PROX reaction.

The study does not provide direct information on water gas shift reactions or methane conversions for these bimetallic catalysts. 

Future UHV studies could potentially provide valuable insights by:

1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of well-defined bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions.
2. Studying the adsorption and reaction of CO, oxygen, and hydrogen on these surfaces at a molecular level.
3. Examining the effects of water on the surface chemistry of these bimetallic catalysts.
4. Comparing the reactivity of model surfaces with supported catalysts to understand the role of the support and particle size effects.

Such UHV studies could bridge the gap between reactor studies and model surfaces, providing atomic-level insights into the mechanisms underlying the enhanced performance of bimetallic catalysts. This could potentially lead to the design of more efficient catalysts for CO oxidation and related reactions.

          基于铂的双金属催化剂，特别是Pt3Co和PtCu等金属间化合物（IMCs），在反应器研究中显著影响CO氧化机理和效率。这些催化剂在较低温度下（373-453 K）对过量氢气中CO的优先氧化（PROX）表现出比纯Pt催化剂更高的活性。

这些双金属催化剂的增强性能归因于几个因素：

1. 电子效应：Pt向Co或Cu原子的电子转移导致Pt原子缺电子，与纯Pt相比更弱地吸附CO，从而促进氧气吸附。

2. 改善的氧气吸附：IMCs中的Co和Cu原子也吸附氧气，有助于在低温下提高PROX活性。

3. 反应机理：反应通过Langmuir-Hinshelwood机理进行，与纯Pt表面上观察到的Rideal机理不同。

4. 协同效应：在Pt3Co上，吸附在Pt上的CO被在Co位点上活化的氧原子氧化，导致比纯Pt更高的活性。

5. 氢气和水的效应：对于PtCu催化剂，氢气和水的存在显著增强了CO转化。添加氢气使CO转化率增加30%，添加水进一步增强了这一效果。这种效应归因于PROX反应过程中产生的水。

该研究没有直接提供这些双金属催化剂在水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化方面的信息。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能通过以下方式提供有价值的见解：

1. 研究反应条件下定义明确的双金属表面的表面结构和组成。
2. 在分子水平上研究CO、氧气和氢气在这些表面上的吸附和反应。
3. 检查水对这些双金属催化剂表面化学的影响。
4. 比较模型表面与负载型催化剂的反应活性，以了解载体和粒子尺寸效应的作用。

这些UHV研究可以弥合反应器研究与模型表面之间的差距，提供对双金属催化剂增强性能背后机理的原子水平见解。这可能导致设计出更高效的CO氧化和相关反应的催化剂。
