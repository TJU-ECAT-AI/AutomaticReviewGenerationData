          "Recent studies on AC supported PtSn showed that the presence of PtSn alloys, especially Pt3Sn, drastically changes the activity and stability characteristics of the catalyst in CO oxidation for both H2-free and H2-rich streams."

"Experimental studies showed that (i) the active site properties of a catalyst determine its performance and (ii) the structure of the support as well as of the active site can be tailored, when a support that has a modifiable surface chemistry, like activated carbon (AC), is used"

"The comparison reveals that adsorption of CO is stronger on Pt surfaces; this may be the reason why catalysts with Pt3Sn phase do not suffer from CO posioning in experimental works."

"Considering the fact that the anode of fuel cells is Pt-coated carbon and it suffers from CO poisoning when hydrogen feed contains CO impurity concentration greater than 4 ppm, understanding COPt3Sn interaction may lead a way to the design and development of a new anode made up of carbon coated with Pt3Sn."

          The literature provides insights into how Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts influence CO oxidation, but does not directly address water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. For CO oxidation, Pt3Sn alloys drastically change the activity and stability of catalysts in both H2-free and H2-rich streams compared to pure Pt. The weaker adsorption of CO on Pt3Sn surfaces compared to pure Pt surfaces may explain why Pt3Sn catalysts are more resistant to CO poisoning. 

The document does not discuss UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces or their potential insights. However, it does mention that experimental studies have shown catalyst performance is determined by active site properties, and that both the support structure and active site can be tailored when using a support with modifiable surface chemistry like activated carbon. This suggests UHV studies on model bimetallic surfaces could potentially provide valuable correlations to explain the improved performance seen in reactor studies with supported catalysts.

Understanding CO-Pt3Sn interactions at the molecular level could help design improved anodes for fuel cells that are less susceptible to CO poisoning. 

To fully address the question, additional studies would be needed on:
1. Water gas shift and methane conversion reactions over Pt-Sn catalysts
2. UHV experiments on well-defined Pt-Sn model surfaces
3. Correlations between UHV results and reactor studies with supported catalysts

The literature suggests tailoring the support and active site structure could optimize catalyst performance, but more research is needed to connect fundamental surface science with applied catalysis for these reactions.

          文献提供了一些关于Pt-Sn双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化的见解，但并未直接涉及水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化。对于CO氧化，与纯Pt相比，Pt3Sn合金在无H2和富H2气流中都能显著改变催化剂的活性和稳定性。与纯Pt表面相比，CO在Pt3Sn表面上的吸附较弱，这可能解释了为什么Pt3Sn催化剂对CO中毒更具抗性。

文献没有讨论Pt基双金属表面的超高真空(UHV)研究或其潜在见解。然而，它确实提到实验研究表明催化剂性能取决于活性位点的特性，并且当使用具有可修饰表面化学性质的载体（如活性炭）时，载体结构和活性位点都可以进行调整。这表明在模型双金属表面上进行的UHV研究可能会提供有价值的相关性，以解释在反应器研究中观察到的负载型催化剂性能改善。

在分子水平上理解CO-Pt3Sn相互作用可能有助于设计改进的燃料电池阳极，使其不易受到CO中毒。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要对以下方面进行额外研究：
1. Pt-Sn催化剂上的水煤气变换和甲烷转化反应
2. 在定义明确的Pt-Sn模型表面上进行UHV实验
3. UHV结果与载体催化剂反应器研究之间的相关性

文献表明，调整载体和活性位点结构可以优化催化剂性能，但需要更多研究来将基础表面科学与这些反应的应用催化联系起来。
