          [1] "Our recent studies [21], [22] evidenced ruthenium as a good catalyst for CPO, though its stability needs to be improved and wide hysteresis cycles are observed while varying reaction temperature, apparently connected to the ease with which Ru is reduced and oxidized."

[2] "Conversely, Pt hardly undergoes redox reactions and it has some activity for CPO as well [23], [25]. In this work we present results of combining Pt and Ru on a bimetallic catalyst that showed good activity and selectivity towards CPO products and a much better stability than monometallic Ru."

[3] "The behavior of the bimetallic catalyst is similar to that of monometallic Pt at low T's, approaching monometallic Ru as the temperature rises. Interestingly, this feature implies that suitable proportions of Pt and Ru can determine the CO/H2 ratio at a given T."

[4] "Summarizing, we can conclude that Pt improves the stability of the catalyst preventing or limiting the Ru redox behavior. Conversely, a lower GHSV is required to achieve higher CO/H2 yields."

[5] "We developed a more efficient and stable catalyst for syngas production from methane. We combined the best features of Pt that activates methane at low temperature and those of Ru that is very selective towards CPO products."

[6] "Pt stabilizes Ru, limiting redox reactions during the heating and cooling cycles. The small residual hysteresis is likely caused by thermal effects and not by chemistry (reduction/oxidation reactions). The light-off temperature is also lower than for monometallic ruthenium, but the catalyst starts converting reactants following mainly total oxidation stoichiometry."

[7] "As temperature increases, CPO products clearly prevail and their ratio stabilizes at a value suitable for Fisher–Tropsch applications (H2/CO2 = 2). Even if not tested for many tens of hours, the catalyst did not show any marked aging effects, keeping its activity almost unchanged."

          The Pt-Ru bimetallic catalyst influences the mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversion in several ways:

1. Improved stability: Pt stabilizes Ru by limiting redox reactions during temperature cycles, reducing hysteresis and improving overall stability compared to monometallic Ru catalysts.

2. Lower light-off temperature: The bimetallic catalyst activates methane conversion at a lower temperature than monometallic Ru, though initially following total oxidation stoichiometry.

3. Temperature-dependent behavior: At low temperatures, the catalyst behaves similarly to monometallic Pt, while at higher temperatures, it approaches the behavior of monometallic Ru.

4. Reaction pathway: As temperature increases, partial oxidation products (CO and H2) become dominant, reaching a ratio suitable for Fischer-Tropsch applications (H2/CO = 2).

5. Tunable product ratio: The CO/H2 ratio can be adjusted by changing the proportions of Pt and Ru in the catalyst.

6. Reduced aging effects: The bimetallic catalyst shows minimal aging effects, maintaining its activity over time.

7. Synergistic effects: The catalyst combines Pt's ability to activate methane at low temperatures with Ru's high selectivity towards CPO products.

8. Trade-off in space velocity: Lower gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) is required to achieve higher CO/H2 yields compared to monometallic catalysts.

The literature does not specifically address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions for this catalyst system. Future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could potentially provide atomic-level insights into:

1. The synergistic effects between Pt and Ru in methane activation and product selectivity.
2. The mechanisms behind Pt's stabilizing effect on Ru.
3. The transition from total oxidation to partial oxidation as temperature increases.
4. The role of each metal in various reaction steps.

Such studies could help correlate reactor findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, bridging the gap between applied catalysis and fundamental surface science. However, it's important to note that UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces have limitations in directly correlating to supported catalysts under reaction conditions. Bridging this "pressure gap" remains a challenge in catalysis research.

          Pt-Ru双金属催化剂以几种方式影响甲烷转化的机理和效率：

1. 改善稳定性：Pt通过限制温度循环过程中的氧化还原反应来稳定Ru，减少滞后现象，与单金属Ru催化剂相比，整体稳定性得到改善。

2. 更低的点火温度：双金属催化剂在比单金属Ru更低的温度下激活甲烷转化，尽管最初遵循完全氧化化学计量比。

3. 温度依赖性行为：在低温下，催化剂的行为类似于单金属Pt，而在高温下，其行为接近单金属Ru。

4. 反应途径：随着温度升高，部分氧化产物（CO和H2）变得占主导地位，达到适合费-托合成的比例（H2/CO = 2）。

5. 可调节的产物比例：通过改变催化剂中Pt和Ru的比例，可以调节CO/H2比率。

6. 老化效应减少：双金属催化剂显示出最小的老化效应，随时间保持其活性。

7. 协同效应：催化剂结合了Pt在低温下激活甲烷的能力和Ru对CPO产物的高选择性。

8. 空速权衡：与单金属催化剂相比，需要较低的气体小时空速（GHSV）来获得更高的CO/H2产率。

文献没有具体讨论该催化剂系统的CO氧化或水气变换反应。未来对Pt基双金属表面的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会提供原子级别的洞见：

1. Pt和Ru在甲烷活化和产物选择性方面的协同效应。
2. Pt对Ru稳定作用的机理。
3. 随温度升高从完全氧化到部分氧化的转变。
4. 各金属在不同反应步骤中的作用。

这些研究可以帮助将反应器研究结果与模型表面和负载催化剂相关联，bridging应用催化与基础表面科学之间的差距。然而，重要的是要注意，Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究在直接与反应条件下的负载催化剂相关联方面存在局限性。弥合这种"压力差距"仍然是催化研究中的一个挑战。
