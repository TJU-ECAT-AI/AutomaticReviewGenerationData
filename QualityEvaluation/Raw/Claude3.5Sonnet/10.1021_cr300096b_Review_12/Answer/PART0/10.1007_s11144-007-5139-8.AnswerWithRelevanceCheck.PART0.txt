          [1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."

          [2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3  0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

          The provided literature offers limited information to fully address the question. It focuses on bimetallic PtNi catalysts for methane reforming with CO2, rather than CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. The study indicates that adding a small amount of Pt (0.3-0.5 wt%) to Ni catalysts affects surface properties and catalytic behavior. Specifically, it reduces NiO particle size, facilitates reduction, and improves nickel particle distribution. However, the document does not discuss mechanisms or efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, or methane conversions in detail. It also does not mention UHV studies, model surfaces, or supported catalysts. The information is insufficient to draw conclusions about potential insights from future UHV studies or to make comparisons with supported catalysts. To fully answer the question, additional research focusing on CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and UHV studies of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts would be needed.

          提供的文献对于全面回答问题的信息有限。它主要关注用于CO2甲烷重整的双金属PtNi催化剂，而非CO氧化或水气变换反应。研究表明，向镍催化剂中添加少量铂（0.3-0.5重量%）会影响表面性质和催化行为。具体来说，它减小了NiO粒子尺寸，促进了还原，并改善了镍粒子的分布。然而，该文档并未详细讨论CO氧化、水气变换反应或甲烷转化的机理或效率。它也没有提到UHV研究、模型表面或负载型催化剂。这些信息不足以得出关于未来UHV研究可能提供的潜在见解，或与负载型催化剂进行比较的结论。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行额外的研究，重点关注CO氧化、水气变换反应以及铂基双金属催化剂的UHV研究。
