[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."

          [2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3  0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

[1] "On the basis of surface science measurements, density functional calculations, and catalytic reactions under realistic conditions, we describe here a strategy to achieve this goal that takes advantage of the confinement effect at interfaces between nanostructured ferrous oxides (FeO) and metal (Pt) substrates."

[2] "Catalytic reaction experiments on the supported Pt-Fe catalysts prepared by a dedicated and reproducible synthesis method show that the identified ensemble is highly active, selective, and robust for CO oxidation, even under operating conditions of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)."

[3] "Among various model systems considered, the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surface presents the highest reactivity because of the presence of the CUF sites."

[4] "For the Pt/SiO2 catalysts, CO conversion is negligible below RT, but increases slowly with temperature. At 473 K, only 70% CO was reacted off. In contrast, the Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts show a high activity, with almost 100% CO conversion and 100% CO selectivity at RT."

[5] "Depending on the CUF sites, O2 may either dissociate directly to atomic O without barrier, or adsorb molecularly first with a binding energy of about 1.51 eV per O2 (Fig. 2A) and afterward dissociate to atomic O with a barrier of 0.42 eV [the corresponding transition state (TS) shown in Fig. 2B]."

[6] "CO oxidation on FeO1-x/Pt(111) might maintain its activity even in the presence of H2 because dissociative adsorption of H2 on Pt suffers from CO poisoning."

[7] "We show that the structural ensemble was highly efficient for carbon monoxide oxidation at low temperature under typical operating conditions of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell."

[8] "The interface-confined CUF sites together with the metal supports are active for dioxygen activation, producing reactive dissociated oxygen atoms."

[9] "Guided by these insights, we prepared Pt-Fe [4 weight percent (wt %) Pt, 0.5 wt % Fe] nanoparticles (NPs) and Pt (4 wt %) NPs supported on nanosized silica spheres."

[10] "CO PROX reactions under stoichiometric condition (1% CO and 0.5% O2, 98.5% H2, 0.1 M Pa, 36000 ml g1 h1) are conducted on the Pt-Fe/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts."

"According to the dual pathway mechanism proposed by Breiter and co-workers,911 the intermediate COads generated in the indirect pathway can be strongly adsorbed on the Pt surface, and the reaction active sites on the Pt become occupied, leading to a severe decrease in reaction kinetics."

"In general, the bifunctional mechanism and ligand effect (electronic effect) were proposed to account for the enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of PtMe catalysts for MOR."

"As for CO oxidation being a structure-sensitive reaction, considerable variables such as crystal face, solution PH, anion adsorption, defects including steps and kinks, pre-history of the electrode, and the size and shape of nanoparticles have all shown important influence on the kinetics of CO oxidation."

"Considerable efforts have been made to obtain highly dispersed RuSex particles with high concentrations of surface sites, thus enhancing the mass activity."

"Regarding the role of Se, Alonso-Vante held that chalcogen additives protected the Ru metal from oxidation."

"Pt alloying with base metals is widely used to enhance the electrocatalytic performance, but contamination of the base metal should be carefully dealt with before practical applications."

"Recently, Jinnouchi et al. showed site-dependent dissolution potentials of Pt particles in which Pt atoms at edges, due to their higher d-band centres, dissolved more easily than Pt atoms on flat surfaces."

"Recent studies on AC supported PtSn showed that the presence of PtSn alloys, especially Pt3Sn, drastically changes the activity and stability characteristics of the catalyst in CO oxidation for both H2-free and H2-rich streams."

"Experimental studies showed that (i) the active site properties of a catalyst determine its performance and (ii) the structure of the support as well as of the active site can be tailored, when a support that has a modifiable surface chemistry, like activated carbon (AC), is used"

"The comparison reveals that adsorption of CO is stronger on Pt surfaces; this may be the reason why catalysts with Pt3Sn phase do not suffer from CO posioning in experimental works."

"Considering the fact that the anode of fuel cells is Pt-coated carbon and it suffers from CO poisoning when hydrogen feed contains CO impurity concentration greater than 4 ppm, understanding COPt3Sn interaction may lead a way to the design and development of a new anode made up of carbon coated with Pt3Sn."

"Kaila et al. found that the addition of rhodium to platinum on zirconia reduced carbon formation and that the stability of the bimetallic catalyst was improved by increasing the Rh/Pt ratio"

"Noble metal catalysts have been found to be more sulfur tolerant than Ni-based catalysts"

"Strohm et al. used a bimetallic NiRh catalyst on CeO2-modified Al2O3 and found that Ni would act as a sacrificial site by adsorbing sulfur preferentially allowing slower deactivation"

[1] "The PtSnOx system has been studied for many years as it has shown to catalyze the CO oxidation at moderate temperatures (ca. 120 C), where neither platinum nor tin dioxide alone has stable activity. The high activity of PtSnOx system has been ascribed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism in which Pt provides the adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx"

[2] "Schubert et al. have investigated PROX on vulcan supported PtSn catalysts and obtained higher activity and selectivity than commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at low temperatures. Their temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), in situ diffuse reflectance IR Fourier transform spectroscopy, and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) measurements revealed that (i) CO surface coverage on the metallic particles is high and decreases with temperature, (ii) only part of the Sn is reduced, included in PtSn alloy particles, while another part forms SnOx islands beside the active particles."

[3] "Addition of methane to the feed used in SET I. 14 reduced the CO conversion significantly at 135 C from ca. 75% to ca. 50% (Fig. 7a). The chromatographic data showed that there is insignificant methane oxidation at 135 C as well as at other lower temperature levels; thus, the possible explanation for the observed decrease in CO conversion level may be the adsorption competition between CH4 and the CO oxidation reactants."

[4] "Owing to that, the necessity of O-spillover (or transfer) through the support is completely eliminated. Thus, on the basis of our current experimental results and our previous experimental and theoretical findings as well, we can suggest a basic CO oxidation surface mechanism for CO and O2-only feed on Pt3Sn sites involving the following steps:

1 CO (g) → CO·Pt
2 O2 (g) → O·Sn and/or O2 (g) → O·PtSn
CO·Pt + O·Sn → CO2 (g) and/or CO·Pt + O·PtSn → CO2·(g)"

[5] "PtSn/AC-N catalyst was tested negative for water gas shift reaction activity at 150 C which eliminates the possibility of CO conversion due to WGS at elevated temperatures."

[1] "When the bimetallic PtRu/SiO2 catalyst was directly reduced in H2 at 300C, its catalytic behavior was similar to that of monometallic Ru/SiO2 pretreated under similar conditions."

[2] "In contrast, when the same bimetallic catalyst underwent O2/H2 treatment at 300C, a delay of approximately 30C was observed in the CO light-off temperature."

[3] "Such a delay, signifying decreased CO oxidation activity, can be related to a decreased fraction of Ru sites available on the surface of this sample, because the FTIR data suggest that the surface of the metal nanoparticles formed after such treatment is enriched with Pt."

[4] "Given the relatively small fraction of exposed Ru sites, we should also consider that the bimetallic interaction between Pt and Ru may have substantially enhanced the activity of Pt for PROX."

[5] "Such an enhancement can be attributed to the lower strength of CO adsorption, as indicated by the FTIR measurements."

[6] "The FTIR results indicate that the adsorption of CO was substantially weaker on bimetallic samples than on the corresponding monometallic ones."

[7] "Our results indicate that regardless of the pretreatment conditions, the CO adsorbed on the Pt sites of the PtRu/SiO2 samples (band at approximately 2070 cm1) is weakly bound to the surface."

[8] "The results indicate that the presence of Pt stabilizes Ru and prevents its sintering during exposure to oxidizing conditions. Furthermore, the strength of the CO adsorption on the bimetallic samples is lower than that on the monometallic counterparts, presumably due to the presence of bimetallic interactions between Pt and Ru."

[9] "Complete conversion of CO was never achieved with the PtRu/SiO2 sample that underwent O2/H2 treatment at 300C. As shown in Fig. 4, the CO conversion decreased immediately after reaching its maximum value of approximately 95% at 140C. Once again, this may be due to the decrease strength of CO adsorption, at elevated temperatures."

[10] "The high activity and selectivity of these monometallic catalysts in PROX is often related to the saturation of metal surfaces by CO, which prevents H2 adsorption and oxidation"

[11] "The lower strength of CO adsorption in the case of the PtRu sample could promote the oxidation of CO on Pt."

[1] "Among the reported heterogeneous catalysts so far for the CO oxidation, PROX reaction and cathodic materials of the PEM fuel cells, supported Pt-Fe nanoparticles prepared by one improved method have been investigated by several groups"

[2] "They proposed a so-called bifunctional mechanism and pointed out that the mechanism was clearly different to that of the PROX reaction on Au catalysts supported on TiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2"

[3] "Up to know, a noncompetitive dual site mechanism has been proposed for the PROX reaction over the supported bimetallic Pt-Fe catalyst"

[4] "It means that platinum site in Pto state acts as CO adsorption site and iron site in FeOx or Feo state as an O2 dissociative-adsorption site enhances the surface reaction between the reactants on the neighboring sites."

[5] "Very recently, Siani et al. reported the silica-supported Pt, PtFe2 and Pt5Fe2 catalysts prepared from PtFe2(COD)(CO)8 (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) and Pt5Fe2(COD)2(CO)12 organometallic cluster precursors, respectively"

[6] "The cluster-derived PtFe/SiO2 catalyst showed improved CO oxidation activity in the presence and absence of hydrogen as compared to that prepared by the conventional methods."

[1] "Pt-based intermetallic compounds (IMCs) supported on silica were studied as a catalyst for the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess hydrogen to obtain the active catalyst at low temperatures."

[2] "Pt3Co/SiO2 and PtCu/SiO2 were more active than Pt/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 in the temperature range of 373453 K."

[3] "Infrared (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and adsorption measurements revealed a significant electron transfer from Pt atoms to Co or Cu atoms. The electron-deficient Pt atoms adsorbed CO weakly compared with Pt metal, accelerating the adsorption of oxygen on the IMC surface."

[4] "Kinetic studies indicated that Co and Cu atoms in IMCs also adsorb oxygen. This improved oxygen adsorption likely resulted in the high PROX activity at low temperatures."

[5] "The reaction proceeded through the LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism, as has been proposed on PtFe/mordenite"

[6] "On PtCu/SiO2, however, CO conversion increased by 30% with the addition of hydrogen and even further by the addition of water. The enhancing effect of hydrogen reflected the contribution of water produced by the oxidation of hydrogen during the PROX reaction."

[7] "The CO molecules on Pt would be oxidized by oxygen atoms activated on Co, resulting in higher activity of Pt3Co compared with Pt metal."

[1] "Modification of Pt/SiO2 with ReOx species enhanced the catalytic activity of the CO oxidation with O2 in the presence of H2."

          [2] "The promoting effect of Re species appeared after the reduction above 673 K."

          [3] "The reduced PtReOx/SiO2 (Re/Pt = 0.5) has high O2 activation ability even when the CO adsorption on the Pt surface atoms is saturated, and this property is caused by the reduced Re species."

          [4] "Under the PROX condition, the reduced state of Re species can be maintained by the presence of H2. The reduced ReOx species can activate O2, and the activated oxygen and oxidizing species are supplied from Re species to the Pt metal surface; as a result, the coverage of oxidizing species is increased and that of adsorbed CO is decreased."

          [5] "Characterization of the reduced PtReOx/SiO2 catalyst by means of EXAFS, XANES, temperature-programmed reduction, and CO adsorption measurements suggested the formation of the ReOx clusters on the surface of Pt metal particles with the average valence of Re of +2.7."

          [6] "These tendencies can be explained by the mechanism where the reduced ReOx species activates O2 and the oxidizing species is spilled over from the ReOx species to the Pt surface."

[1] "The activity over PdPt/Al2O3 was greater than that over Pd/Al2O3 after 6.6 h for the conditions used in this study."

[2] "The activity of PdPt/Al2O3 increased with time. Results from TPO, XRD, XPS, and TEM indicate that the increase was due to significantly greater PdO production during operation."

[3] "The morphology of the noble metal particles in PdPt/Al2O3 consisted of two parts, one rich in PdO and the other consisting of an alloy between Pd and Pt. These two parts were always found in close contact."

[4] "For the oxidation reaction of methane, stable conversion was observed only for the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst, where both metallic Pd and PdO coexist on the surface, whereas for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, all Pd transformed into PdO over time."

[5] "The thermal aging was worse for Pd/Al2O3 than for PdPt/Al2O3. Thus, Pt prevents the aging of Pd catalysts."

"Among them AuPt/CeO2 catalyst shows the highest activity with 78% conversion of CO at 250 C."

"The activity increases obviously with Pt loadings in AuPt/CeO2. For example, CO conversion is only 8.9% at 200 C for Au/CeO2 catalyst. When the Pt loading reaches 0.5%, 1%, and 2%, CO conversion improves to 37.6%, 46.5% and 54.1%, respectively."

"For bimetallic AuPt/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles emerges at 145 C and the low-temperature reduction peak of ceria is shifted to at Tmax = 390 C. These results indicated that the coexistence of both Au and Pt is beneficial to the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles and the reduction of surface ceria."

"Besides, the concentration of the surface oxygen of ceria obviously increases in the presence of Pt. It causes the formation of oxygen vacancies, located mainly on the catalyst surface. This is why the bimetallic Au and Pt catalysts possess the higher WGS reaction activity than monometallic Au/CeO2 or Pt/CeO2 catalyst."

"The addition of Pt is conducive to the formation of Auδ+ because of the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band, accompanied by intraatomic charge redistributions. The presence of both metallic and ionic gold species, the high concentration of surface oxygen as well as the low degree of Ce3+ surface defects determine simultaneously the WGS reaction activity of the bimetallic AuPt catalyst."

"It is found that the introduction of platinum in AuPt/CeO2 catalyst is responsible for the formation of partly oxidized gold species probably due to the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band."

"The presence of both gold and platinum is beneficial to the reduction of ceria to Ce3+ species as well as the creation of oxygen vacancies and makes the average size of ceria smaller."

[1] "Addition of Pt progressively promotes thermal decomposition and chemical reduction (by CH4) of PdO. On increasing the Pt/Pd ratio oxidation of metallic Pd is also progressively inhibited, being completely hindered for the Pt/Pd-1 sample."

[2] "Repeated Pd reduction/re-oxidation cycles are effective in increasing catalytic activity of Pt/Pd-0 and Pt/Pd-0.10 samples: these systems exhibit a marked activation during the conditioning process up to the highest levels among the catalysts tested in this work."

[3] "The correlation of PdO reducibility to CH4 combustion activity which is observed in monometallic catalyst, in line with a redox mechanism kinetically controlled by the reduction step, does not apply in the case of bimetallic samples."

[4] "As a whole, the effect of Pt on PdO CH4 combustion activity is not straightforward. Depending on several factors, such as the extent of PdO formation, the strength of Pd–support interactions, the stabilization of metallic Pd, Pt may act as an inhibitor or a promoter of catalytic activity."

[1] "The PtCu catalyst showed lower H2 yield in WGS compared to the Cu catalyst, but it exhibited higher H2 yield in OWGS, and extent of the enhancement by O2 addition (difference between OWGS and WGS) is similar to PdCu catalyst."

[2] "The combination of Pt and Cu lowers the reduction temperature of Cu giving a single peak at around 148 C. This suggests that Pt and Cu interact and each makes the other more reducible."

[3] "Fits of Pt(1)Cu(5)/CeO2 showed completely different environment around Pt from Pt(1)/CeO2, i.e., Pt has 6 Cu neighbors at 2.54 Å and 3 Pt neighbors at 2.75 Å. The higher Pt coordination to Cu than to Pt indicates high dispersion of Pt in Cu, probably forming PtCu alloy."

[4] "It was proposed that the O2 addition partially oxidizes chemisorbed CO leading to vacant sites for H2O adsorption and reaction."

[5] "Ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, such as PtCu and PdCu, exhibited higher OWGS activity than monometallic catalysts while the superiority of bimetallic catalysts was not as pronounced in WGS."

[6] "The TPR and OSC measurements revealed the existence of strong interaction between Pt and Cu or between Pd and Cu, which makes the bimetallic catalyst more resistant toward oxidation (less pyrophoric)."

[7] "EXAFS spectra indicated that Cu forms alloys with Pt and with Pd."

[8] "The presence of Cu in PdCu/CeO2 facilitates CO2 desorption, decreasing the amount of surface carbonate on CeO2."

[1] "Effects of methane oxygen mixture addition to steam reforming of methane and subsequent removal of the methane oxygen mixture from the oxidative steam reforming of methane on catalytic performance were investigated using monometallic Ni and Pt catalysts and two PtNi bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "Hysteresis with respect to the addition and removal of the methane oxygen mixture was observed clearly on a PtNi bimetallic catalyst prepared by co-impregnation method and the Ni catalyst. In contrast, no hysteresis was observed for a PtNi catalyst that was prepared by sequential impregnation method."

[3] "PtNi catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation is formed PtNi alloy particles, where Pt atoms are segregated on the surface, enhances the reducibility of Ni drastically and this is related to the behavior without hysteresis."

[4] "Characterization of results using Pt L3-edge and Ni K-edge EXAFS analysis and FTIR of CO adsorption suggest that the PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated to the surface can be formed on the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6), which might be related to the lack of hysteresis behavior by high reducibility and the suppression of the deep oxidation of Ni species."

[5] "In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the temperature over the catalyst bed inlet is high. However, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase than other catalysts, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone."

[1] "Bimetallic catalysts often present superior catalytic performance in comparison to their parent metals and have been widely used in many catalytic processes."

          [2] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."

          [3] "The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunabiity in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

"The key for the improvement of the CO oxidation rate is to allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2. New catalyst formulations are being developed towards supplying these catalysts with an additional site for oxygen adsorption, which will enhance the reaction rate, by addition of a promoter"

"An example of this development is the addition of Fe as a promoter for Pt catalysts. The Pt serves as the site for CO adsorption, whereas the Fe oxide promoter dissociates the O2 molecule, resulting in a non-competitive, dual-site mechanism."

"MnOx is reported as high oxygen storage capacity compound. MnOx has been studied in oxidation reactions and as support for Au catalyst in the PROX reaction. MnOx-doped Pt catalysts have been studied for automotive pollution control and for CO oxidation (in H2-free streams)."

"Comparing the PROX behavior of all catalysts in Fig. 5(a), we can see that those with a higher content in MnOx (P1M8ASI and P1M15ASI) are more active than Pt/Al2O3, with the following order of activity: P1M15ASI > P1M8ASI > P1A > P1M2ASI > M2P1ASI ≈ P1M2ACI ≈ M2A."

"While the WGS reaction is beneficial in its forward direction, methanation reactions are always detrimental and should be avoided."

[1] "Chen et al. [11] studied the promoting effect of Pt, Pd and Rh in Ni0.03Mg0.97O catalysts for CO2-reforming. They found that the noble metal addition improves the catalyst stability and reducibility."

[2] "Pawelec et al. [3] reported that, in bimetallic PtNi catalysts supported on ZSM-5 for DRM, the presence of Pt (0.5%) leads to the formation of small and reducible nano-sized NiO particles. They also observed an improvement in the catalytic activity and stability, which was attributed to an increase in the nickel metallic dispersion caused by intimate contact between nickel and platinum."

[3] "Activity tests demonstrated that Pt presence and the use of the nanofibrous support in Ni catalysts improve CH4 and CO2 conversions, reaching values close to equilibrium. Moreover, Pt inhibits coke deposition and reduces the operation temperature."

[4] "From stability tests it can be concluded that Pt enhances the stability of Ni-based catalysts for DRM."

[5] "The addition of Pt modifies the Ni ensembles, by a synergic effect, varying the dissociative adsorption capacity of methane and consequently reducing the net carbon formation. This fact together with the ability of Pt to remove carbon by CO2 could produce differences between the rates of carbon deposition and gasification by CO2; at higher Pt content, higher carbon gasification and less net carbon formation."

[6] "The carbon formation in the DRM occurs via two reactions: methane decomposition and CO disproportionation reactions. Methane decomposition is a structure-sensitivity reaction, which can be inhibited by controlling the catalyst surface structure. Apparently, the Pt incorporation not only conditions the Ni0 particles size, but also avoids the Ni encapsulation by carbon."

[1] "The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was shown to enhance the watergas shift (WGS) rate compared with the rate observed with Pt alone supported on either Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 at similar Pt weight loadings."

[2] "The results from CO chemisorption showed that the Pt was more highly dispersed on Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 than on the Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[3] "The WGS rate was observed to be proportional to the exposed Pt surface area for the Pt-Re and Pt catalysts; however, the rate per m2 of exposed Pt for Pt-Re/ Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was higher than that of Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[4] "The difference in the rates upon the addition of Re to Pt WGS catalysts suggests that the role of Re in enhancing the WGS activity of Pt is more complex than to just increase the Pt dispersion."

[5] "If the only function of Re was to increase the Pt dispersion, one would expect the same WGS activity for both Pt and Pt-Re catalysts."

[6] "A bifunctional redox mechanism is used to explain this synergism. In this mechanism, CO is adsorbed on the platinum, then oxygen is transferred from the ceria to the platinum, where the CO is oxidized (CO2) and the ceria is reduced (Ce4+  Ce3+); finally, the reduced ceria is reoxidized (Ce3+  Ce4+) by the dissociative adsorption of H2O, releasing H2 in the process."

[1] "Besides, in the bimetallic catalysts, there is a Pt-Ni interaction between metallic centers, which enhances the catalyst stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO."

[2] "It is interesting to point out that, in the Ni containing catalysts the Ni0/NiAl2O4 and the Ni0/NiO ratios increased when Pt was incorporated and when the catalysts were prepared by ME, as can be observed in Table 5."

[3] "Characterization results indicate that the incorporation of Pt in Ni-based catalyst has a great influence on the Ni species distribution, the Ni particle size and dispersion, in addition to the net carbon formation. In the bimetallic PtNi catalyst there is a synergic effect between PtNi which modifies the Ni disposition, as well as its reducibility by the spillover of hydrogen from Pt to Ni"

[4] "Adding Pt and/or preparing the catalysts by ME the Ni0 and Pt0 particles size can be controlled and the metal encapsulation by carbon avoided. The activity and stability of the PtNi nanocatalysts is improved when the metal ensembles have similar dimensions to the fibers of the support, which avoids metal sintering and the insertion of Ni into the alumina structure."

[5] "Monometallic and bimetallic PtNi catalysts prepared by ME and supported on the nanofibrous alumina seem to be successful catalysts for the DRM, with high selectivity towards H2/CO and low towards coke."

[1] "The catalyst is 0.5% Ru and 0.5% Pt (w/w) supported on mixture of alumina, ceria and zirconia (75/4.4/20.6%, w/w), washcoated on a ceramic monolith."

[2] "We already studied the activity of this 0.5/0.5% Pt/Ru catalyst for partial oxidation, speculating that combustion and reforming of methane occurs sequentially, and that is clearly identified also by tests on the global reaction, without studying each single reaction in the mechanism."

[3] "Through specific tests with selected mixtures, we proved that the PtRu catalyst supports the indirect combustion and reforming mechanism in CPO, as already suggested in a previous work."

[4] "The catalyst was active in catalysing all the candidate reactions (steam reforming, dry reforming and direct/reverse water-gas shift)."

[5] "Both the direct and the reverse water-gas shift reactions are very fast and not affected by the gas space velocity. They approach the thermodynamic equilibrium, with the direct reaction being more relevant for the global mechanism at low temperature, while the reverse reaction becomes more important at high temperature."

[6] "The steam reforming tests showed that this reaction gives a considerable contribution mainly at the lowest GHSV, explaining the differences in the conversions detected during CPO tests."

[7] "Results indicate that the PtRu catalyst is active also for dry reforming, significantly converting both CO2 and CH4 to H2 and CO."

[1] "The catalytic data reported here show that the monometallic 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is slightly more active than the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the dry reforming of methane, in spite of the smaller metal content, in agreement with the intrinsically higher activity of platinum with respect to nickel in the reaction."

[2] "However, an improvement in the catalyst activity can be obtained not only by introducing a small amount of Pt on the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst) but also adding a significant amount of Ni to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst)."

[3] "It is evident that some kind of synergy occurs between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, improving DRM activity, in terms of conversion. Thus, these elements have a mutual role of activators for each other."

[4] "However, the most relevant effect that can also have practical application is that the addition of small amounts of Pt significantly decreases the deactivation rate of the catalyst (as discussed in detail elsewhere [28]) by reducing the formation of carbon nanotubes."

[5] "IR spectra of adsorbed CO confirm that a solid solution occurs, indicating that the surface appears to be dominated by Pt centers whose electron-withdrawing character is increased by nickel."

[6] "The formation of PtNi alloy, which is enriched at the surface by Pt and has smaller metal crystal size than metal particles in monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts. The alloy formation is associated with higher activity and lower production of carbonaceous materials upon dry reforming of methane."

[7] "The addition of platinum, however, favors the formation of even smaller metal particles with respect to pure nickel, thus increasing significantly the electron-withdrawing ability of Pt centers."

[8] "The presence of such particles modifies the chemical behavior of Ni, increasing its reducibility as shown by XPS data as well as by Temperature-Programmed Reduction results"

[1] "At present there are few UHV studies of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. The overview will therefore focus primarily on reactor studies, with the anticipation that the intriguing properties of these catalysts would inspire future UHV studies to correlate model surfaces with supported catalysts."

[6] "PtNi supported on MgAl2O4 exhibits self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics. Without prereduction, the PtNi bimetallic catalyst dissociates CH4 under reaction conditions to form hydrogen, which spills over and reduces other metallic particles on the catalyst."

[2] "Incorporation of platinum into the palladium catalyst prevents the drop of methane conversion."

[3] "The steady-state tests showed a major decrease in activity with time-on-stream for the palladium catalyst. Hence, for any practical application it will be of paramount importance to improve the stability of methane conversion."

[4] "All bimetallic catalysts gave significantly more stable methane conversion compared to the monometallic catalyst during operation at steady state."

[5] "The nature of the support material affects the combustion performance of the bimetallic PdPt catalysts."

[6] "All PdPt catalysts, independently of the support, have considerably more stable methane conversion than the monometallic palladium catalyst."

[7] "PdPtAl2O3 was the most active catalyst in the low-temperature region, PdPt supported on ceria-stabilised ZrO2 was the most active between 620 and 800 C, whereas PdPt supported on LaMnAl11O19 was superior for temperatures above 800 C."

[8] "The bimetallic catalysts show strong reflections located between the 2θ values of Pd0 and Pt0, i.e. between of 40.115 and 39.889. This indicates a close interaction between the two metals."

[9] "PdPtCeZrO2 is the most active of the bimetallic catalysts in the steady-state test at temperatures above 620 C."

[10] "The drop in the methane conversion during the PdO decomposition was suppressed for the ZrO2-based catalysts compared to the Al2O3-based catalysts."

[11] "The bimetallic catalysts had a molar ratio of 2:1 Pd:Pt."

[12] "The activity of the bimetallic catalysts increases with time-on-stream, probably due to PdO formation during operation."

[13] "Both the TPO profile and the in situ XRD diffractograms suggest that PdPtCeZrO2 reoxidises Pd very easily during cooling."

[1] "The combined effect of Ni and Pt can produce a coke-resistant catalyst."

[2] "The results demonstrated that the bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalyst showed lower activity (e.g., NiPtY and NiPtβ activities were 1.70 and 1.90 gmetal1 h1, respectively) than that of the monometallic Pt/zeolite catalyst (e.g., PtY and Ptβ activities were close to 2.0 and 3.20 gmetal1 h1, respectively)."

[3] "The behaviour of NiPt bimetallic samples is quite similar to that of Ptβ; in others words, NiPtY and NiPtβ produce a large amount of graphite-like carbon and a small amount of filamentous carbon."

[4] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts can also be explained by the fact that the presence of a second metal such as platinum exposes the nickel to the reactants, meaning a redispersion of Ni occurs due to the addition/dispersion of a second metal, e.g., platinum"

[5] "In addition, in the case of NiPt bimetallic systems, the rate of decomposition of methane is slower than that on monometallic nickel systems. This is explained by the large lability of the type of carbon species formed on the bimetallic samples."

[6] "Pt dispersed on BEA zeolite produced lower carbon deposition (16 wt%) and this coke was easily removed by CO2."

[7] "The mechanistic investigations reveal that the dispersion of carbon during the dry reforming of methane is the result of a number of adsorption and elementary chemical steps. First, methane cracking and Boudouard reactions (reactions (VIII) and (XIX)) produce surface carbon on the Ni particles embedded in the support. Second, the diffusion of carbon through the Ni particles occurs, followed by segregation at the rear. Finally, the Ni particle is lifted from the support by a growing carbon filament."

[1] "As compared to their Pt and Co monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and allow the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures to be reduced from 1 to 103 vol %."

          [2] "This effect is likely due to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface."

[1] "A series of PtNi bimetallic catalysts supported on δ-Al2O3 to be used in carbon dioxide reforming of methane was prepared and tested with the objective of optimizing the Ni/Pt metal composition to obtain high activity and stability."

[2] "The activity results showed that the catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples strongly depended on the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio."

[3] "Among all the catalysts, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, which has the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability."

[4] "The combined characterization and catalyst performance tests results reveal that low Ni/Pt molar loading ratio of 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 sample led to a relatively easy reduction of nickel oxide species and smaller nano-sized nickel particles having better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites in the closed vicinity."

[5] "The results of the combined dry reforming and partial oxidation tests strongly indicated a change in surface reaction mechanism depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts."

[6] "The changes in the catalysts activity and stability under the presence of an additional oxygen source were determined through addition of small amounts of either oxygen or water vapor to the feed stream."

[1] "Platinumtin bimetallic catalysts are of interest for selective oxidation and reduction reactions, and are commercially important for petroleum reforming"

[2] "Compared to Pt catalysts, PtSn reforming catalysts have greater resistance to coking and increased selectivity to aromatics."

[3] "It has been reported that on alumina, tin is partially oxidized to create a mixed catalyst with a supported alloy phase PtSn/Al2O3 and a tin oxide-supported, Pt-phase Pt/SnOx/Al2O3, where the relative concentrations are determined mainly by particle size"

[4] "Specifically, the effect of tin oxidation on the kinetics of CO oxidation by O2 on an α-Al2O3 supported, PtSn catalyst has been studied by Grass and Lintz"

[5] "Industrial, supported, PtSn catalysts, however, include an oxide support material and are complicated materials systems for which it is difficult to assess the phases present and the catalytic activity of each phase."

[1] "Among a number of catalysts reported to be active for PROX, supported platinum catalysts have been considered to be promising in view of their high catalytic performance."

[2] "PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a H2-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K."

[3] "The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity."

[4] "For CO oxidation, it has been proposed that the lattice oxygen and interfacial metalsupport interaction play a crucial role in promoting CO oxidation when metal species are supported on an oxygen-ion-conducting support."

[5] "Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted to try to determine the interactions between Pt and Co, as well as those between Pt, Co oxides (CoOx), and YSZ"

[6] "Three main reactions take place in this system. The reaction that competes most effectively with CO oxidation [Eq.(1)] is H2 oxidation [Eq.(2)] because of the H2-rich conditions in the gas stream in practical fuel cell applications. In addition, CO can consume additional H2 by undergoing hydrogenation [Eq.(3)], a process also known as methanation, which should be avoided unless the CO concentration in the reactant stream is quite low, because it consumes relatively large amounts of hydrogen (3mol per mol CO)."

[1] "PtFe/SiO2 samples were found to be more active than monometallic Pt/SiO2 for the oxidation of CO in air. This enhancement of the catalytic activity strongly depends on the degree of electronic interaction between the metals and the strength of CO adsorption."

          [2] "Our FTIR data show that the sample with the highest activity for CO oxidation was also characterized by a relatively low strength of CO adsorption."

          [3] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that direct contact between Pt and Fe is essential for the enhancement of the Pt activity for the oxidation of CO, as we proposed earlier. Furthermore, our results suggest that such direct contact is better achieved at low Fe contents and leads to a weakening of the adsorption of CO on Pt, which in turn, enhances the rate of CO oxidation."

          [4] "The presence of PtFe bimetallic interactions and the transfer of electron density from Fe to Pt are important factors influencing the final density of states and affecting the repulsive interactions between adsorbing CO molecules and surface metal adsorption sites."

          [5] "The close proximity between Pt and Fe in such sites leads to the reduction of Fe, which can be active for cyclohexane dehydrogenation."

          [6] "Furthermore, PtFe adsorption sites could favor the di-σCO mode of adsorption for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, thus promoting the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond and the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols."

[1] "The modification of Ni with Pt suppressed the oxidation of Ni species near the bed inlet in the oxidative steam reforming of methane at 1123 K, although the species on the monometallic Ni catalysts were oxidized under similar conditions."

[2] "This can be due to the decreased oxidation rate of the species and the increased reduction rate caused by the surface modification of Ni with Pt."

[3] "Consequently, the PtNi species can be maintained in the metallic state near the bed inlet, and the species can be the active site for the reforming reaction as well as the combustion reaction, which this leads to a lower bed temperature and smaller temperature gradient than those seen for the monometallic Ni catalysts."

[4] "The additive effect of Pt by the sequential impregnation method (Pt/Ni) was much more significant than that by the co-impregnation method (Pt + Ni) in terms of catalytic performance and catalyst bed temperature profile."

[5] "The combination of EXAFS and FTIR results suggests segregation of Pt atoms on the surface of the PtNi alloy particles."

[6] "Characterization results by means of TEM, TPR, EXAFS, and FTIR suggest that the Pt atoms on the Pt/Ni catalysts were located more preferably on the surface to form a PtNi alloy than those on the Pt + Ni catalysts."

[1] "It has been reported that, after reduction, the metallic Pt and Sn formed are predominantly PtSn alloys with hydroxy groups on Pt/SnOx, which are involved in CO oxidation"

[2] "The results reported clearly show the catalytic CO oxidation activity at lower temperatures when the Pt3Sn alloy phase is present in these catalysts"

[3] "Of the two Pt alloys, PtSn and Pt3Sn, the Pt rich Pt3Sn can adsorb oxygen more readily at lower temperatures than PtSn"

[4] "The intimate contact between the metallic phase and the SnOx interface may be another factor which plays a role in the enhanced adsorption ability and the CO oxidation activity"

[5] "It has been proposed in the literature that the CO oxidation reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and adsorbed O"

[6] "The results indicate the beneficial use of AC supports rich in surface oxygen bearing groups, which lead to the formation of Pt-rich alloys without an additional oxidation step of the catalyst after reduction."

[7] "The activity of PtSn/AC catalysts in CO oxidation reaction is strongly affected by the surface chemistry of the support, the preparation method of the catalyst, the Pt:Sn ratio and the reduction procedure applied."

[1] "Many studies have been made on the approach of combinatorial catalysis especially Pt and Pd for CO oxidation reaction [10]. Using bimetallic system is an attractive alternative that appears to enhance some properties of the catalyst or some synergistic effect as electronic effect/geometry effect."

[2] "Although it is still not yet well understood, it has been established that the bimetallic system improves both activity and selectivity of a great number of reactions [11,12]."

[3] "Narui et al. [17] attributed the superior combustion activity of PdPt to higher dispersion of supported particles and suppression of particle growth."

[4] "The catalytic activity was obviously increased with the increasing content of Pd. However, the results at a ratio of Pt: Pd = 1: 9 evidenced that it was not necessary to load Pd in very high loadings. The catalyst with a ratio of Pt: Pd = 1: 7 showed the best performance, 76% CO conversion and 55% selectivity and at 90.110 C."

[5] "When increasing the O2 concentration to twice the stoichiometric ratio of the oxygen concentration (1% O2 ), the CO conversion increased to 76% at 90.110 C. Ninty nine percent CO conversion of 1% CO at 90 C can be achieved by increasing the oxygen concentration to 2%."

[6] "An enhancement of CO oxidation reaction can be apparently observed when adding 10% water vapor in the feed. At 90 C, when there was no water vapor in the feed stream the CO conversion was about 76% and when adding 10% water vapor in the feed stream the CO conversion was increased to 85%."

[7] "The CO conversion substantially dropped from 76% to 50% at 90.110 C when increasing CO2 concentration in the feed stream. The presence of CO2 also affected the selectivity in the temperature range of 50.190 C."

[8] "One was that water enhances the water gas shift reaction and as a result more CO was converted into CO2, the second possibility was that the hydroxyl group formed on the catalyst upon adsorption of water was a better oxidation than oxygen and increases the oxidation rate of CO and hydrogen [18]."

[9] "As compared to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of water in the feed enhances the CO oxidation rate [6,22]."

[1] "The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts; however a different addition manner was suggested for the later acceleration effect over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts."

[2] "The activity of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts was strongly affected by the Re content, while the activity of PtRe/TiO2 catalysts was less dependent on the addition ratio of Re, and more dependent on the temperature of reduction."

[3] "The FT-IR analyses of the adsorbed species during the reaction exhibited the enhancement of the adsorbed CO peaks in lower wavenumber region with the increase of Re content. Accordingly, Re is supposed to have some effect on these adsorbed CO, which accelerates the WGS reaction, especially in the case of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts."

[4] "WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction."

[5] "The role of Re would be the stabilization of formate species and accelerate the rate of H2 formation."

[6] "PtRe/TiO2 system is known as a good catalyst showing activity close to Cu catalysts in low temperature"

[7] "Under LTR condition, the change of the CO concentration only started at around 373 K; the most active catalysts was PtRe(2:0)/TiO2, and the addition of Re affected the reaction rate negatively."

[1] "Our recent studies [21], [22] evidenced ruthenium as a good catalyst for CPO, though its stability needs to be improved and wide hysteresis cycles are observed while varying reaction temperature, apparently connected to the ease with which Ru is reduced and oxidized."

[2] "Conversely, Pt hardly undergoes redox reactions and it has some activity for CPO as well [23], [25]. In this work we present results of combining Pt and Ru on a bimetallic catalyst that showed good activity and selectivity towards CPO products and a much better stability than monometallic Ru."

[3] "The behavior of the bimetallic catalyst is similar to that of monometallic Pt at low T's, approaching monometallic Ru as the temperature rises. Interestingly, this feature implies that suitable proportions of Pt and Ru can determine the CO/H2 ratio at a given T."

[4] "Summarizing, we can conclude that Pt improves the stability of the catalyst preventing or limiting the Ru redox behavior. Conversely, a lower GHSV is required to achieve higher CO/H2 yields."

[5] "We developed a more efficient and stable catalyst for syngas production from methane. We combined the best features of Pt that activates methane at low temperature and those of Ru that is very selective towards CPO products."

[6] "Pt stabilizes Ru, limiting redox reactions during the heating and cooling cycles. The small residual hysteresis is likely caused by thermal effects and not by chemistry (reduction/oxidation reactions). The light-off temperature is also lower than for monometallic ruthenium, but the catalyst starts converting reactants following mainly total oxidation stoichiometry."

[7] "As temperature increases, CPO products clearly prevail and their ratio stabilizes at a value suitable for Fisher–Tropsch applications (H2/CO2 = 2). Even if not tested for many tens of hours, the catalyst did not show any marked aging effects, keeping its activity almost unchanged."

[1] "Selective CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over supported Pt catalysts promoted with various transition metal compounds such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Zr."

[2] "Among them, Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 showed high CO conversions over wide reaction temperatures."

[3] "The catalytic activity at low temperatures increased with increasing the molar ratio of Ni/Pt. This accompanied the TPR peak shift to lower temperatures."

[4] "The bimetallic phase of Pt-Ni seems to give rise to stable activity with high CO2 selectivity in selective oxidation of CO in H2-rich stream."

[1] "The co-impregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 was superior to Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/Pt/γ-Al2O3 prepared by a sequential impregnation of each component on alumina support."

          [2] "As the reduction temperature increased above 423 K, the CO2 selectivity decreased and the atomic percent of Ni in the bimetallic phase of PtNi increased."

          [3] "This catalyst exhibited the high CO conversion even in the presence of 2% H2O and 20% CO2 over a wide reaction temperature."

          [4] "The bimetallic phase of PtNi seems to give rise to high catalytic activity for the PROX in H2-rich stream."

[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."

          [2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3  0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

[1] "On the basis of surface science measurements, density functional calculations, and catalytic reactions under realistic conditions, we describe here a strategy to achieve this goal that takes advantage of the confinement effect at interfaces between nanostructured ferrous oxides (FeO) and metal (Pt) substrates."

[2] "Catalytic reaction experiments on the supported Pt-Fe catalysts prepared by a dedicated and reproducible synthesis method show that the identified ensemble is highly active, selective, and robust for CO oxidation, even under operating conditions of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)."

[3] "Among various model systems considered, the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surface presents the highest reactivity because of the presence of the CUF sites."

[4] "For the Pt/SiO2 catalysts, CO conversion is negligible below RT, but increases slowly with temperature. At 473 K, only 70% CO was reacted off. In contrast, the Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts show a high activity, with almost 100% CO conversion and 100% CO selectivity at RT."

[5] "Depending on the CUF sites, O2 may either dissociate directly to atomic O without barrier, or adsorb molecularly first with a binding energy of about 1.51 eV per O2 (Fig. 2A) and afterward dissociate to atomic O with a barrier of 0.42 eV [the corresponding transition state (TS) shown in Fig. 2B]."

[6] "CO oxidation on FeO1-x/Pt(111) might maintain its activity even in the presence of H2 because dissociative adsorption of H2 on Pt suffers from CO poisoning."

[7] "We show that the structural ensemble was highly efficient for carbon monoxide oxidation at low temperature under typical operating conditions of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell."

[8] "The interface-confined CUF sites together with the metal supports are active for dioxygen activation, producing reactive dissociated oxygen atoms."

[9] "Guided by these insights, we prepared Pt-Fe [4 weight percent (wt %) Pt, 0.5 wt % Fe] nanoparticles (NPs) and Pt (4 wt %) NPs supported on nanosized silica spheres."

[10] "CO PROX reactions under stoichiometric condition (1% CO and 0.5% O2, 98.5% H2, 0.1 M Pa, 36000 ml g1 h1) are conducted on the Pt-Fe/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts."

"According to the dual pathway mechanism proposed by Breiter and co-workers,911 the intermediate COads generated in the indirect pathway can be strongly adsorbed on the Pt surface, and the reaction active sites on the Pt become occupied, leading to a severe decrease in reaction kinetics."

"In general, the bifunctional mechanism and ligand effect (electronic effect) were proposed to account for the enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of PtMe catalysts for MOR."

"As for CO oxidation being a structure-sensitive reaction, considerable variables such as crystal face, solution PH, anion adsorption, defects including steps and kinks, pre-history of the electrode, and the size and shape of nanoparticles have all shown important influence on the kinetics of CO oxidation."

"Considerable efforts have been made to obtain highly dispersed RuSex particles with high concentrations of surface sites, thus enhancing the mass activity."

"Regarding the role of Se, Alonso-Vante held that chalcogen additives protected the Ru metal from oxidation."

"Pt alloying with base metals is widely used to enhance the electrocatalytic performance, but contamination of the base metal should be carefully dealt with before practical applications."

"Recently, Jinnouchi et al. showed site-dependent dissolution potentials of Pt particles in which Pt atoms at edges, due to their higher d-band centres, dissolved more easily than Pt atoms on flat surfaces."

"Recent studies on AC supported PtSn showed that the presence of PtSn alloys, especially Pt3Sn, drastically changes the activity and stability characteristics of the catalyst in CO oxidation for both H2-free and H2-rich streams."

"Experimental studies showed that (i) the active site properties of a catalyst determine its performance and (ii) the structure of the support as well as of the active site can be tailored, when a support that has a modifiable surface chemistry, like activated carbon (AC), is used"

"The comparison reveals that adsorption of CO is stronger on Pt surfaces; this may be the reason why catalysts with Pt3Sn phase do not suffer from CO posioning in experimental works."

"Considering the fact that the anode of fuel cells is Pt-coated carbon and it suffers from CO poisoning when hydrogen feed contains CO impurity concentration greater than 4 ppm, understanding COPt3Sn interaction may lead a way to the design and development of a new anode made up of carbon coated with Pt3Sn."

"Kaila et al. found that the addition of rhodium to platinum on zirconia reduced carbon formation and that the stability of the bimetallic catalyst was improved by increasing the Rh/Pt ratio"

"Noble metal catalysts have been found to be more sulfur tolerant than Ni-based catalysts"

"Strohm et al. used a bimetallic NiRh catalyst on CeO2-modified Al2O3 and found that Ni would act as a sacrificial site by adsorbing sulfur preferentially allowing slower deactivation"

[1] "The PtSnOx system has been studied for many years as it has shown to catalyze the CO oxidation at moderate temperatures (ca. 120 C), where neither platinum nor tin dioxide alone has stable activity. The high activity of PtSnOx system has been ascribed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism in which Pt provides the adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx"

[2] "Schubert et al. have investigated PROX on vulcan supported PtSn catalysts and obtained higher activity and selectivity than commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at low temperatures. Their temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), in situ diffuse reflectance IR Fourier transform spectroscopy, and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) measurements revealed that (i) CO surface coverage on the metallic particles is high and decreases with temperature, (ii) only part of the Sn is reduced, included in PtSn alloy particles, while another part forms SnOx islands beside the active particles."

[3] "Addition of methane to the feed used in SET I. 14 reduced the CO conversion significantly at 135 C from ca. 75% to ca. 50% (Fig. 7a). The chromatographic data showed that there is insignificant methane oxidation at 135 C as well as at other lower temperature levels; thus, the possible explanation for the observed decrease in CO conversion level may be the adsorption competition between CH4 and the CO oxidation reactants."

[4] "Owing to that, the necessity of O-spillover (or transfer) through the support is completely eliminated. Thus, on the basis of our current experimental results and our previous experimental and theoretical findings as well, we can suggest a basic CO oxidation surface mechanism for CO and O2-only feed on Pt3Sn sites involving the following steps:

1 CO (g) → CO·Pt
2 O2 (g) → O·Sn and/or O2 (g) → O·PtSn
CO·Pt + O·Sn → CO2 (g) and/or CO·Pt + O·PtSn → CO2·(g)"

[5] "PtSn/AC-N catalyst was tested negative for water gas shift reaction activity at 150 C which eliminates the possibility of CO conversion due to WGS at elevated temperatures."

[1] "When the bimetallic PtRu/SiO2 catalyst was directly reduced in H2 at 300C, its catalytic behavior was similar to that of monometallic Ru/SiO2 pretreated under similar conditions."

[2] "In contrast, when the same bimetallic catalyst underwent O2/H2 treatment at 300C, a delay of approximately 30C was observed in the CO light-off temperature."

[3] "Such a delay, signifying decreased CO oxidation activity, can be related to a decreased fraction of Ru sites available on the surface of this sample, because the FTIR data suggest that the surface of the metal nanoparticles formed after such treatment is enriched with Pt."

[4] "Given the relatively small fraction of exposed Ru sites, we should also consider that the bimetallic interaction between Pt and Ru may have substantially enhanced the activity of Pt for PROX."

[5] "Such an enhancement can be attributed to the lower strength of CO adsorption, as indicated by the FTIR measurements."

[6] "The FTIR results indicate that the adsorption of CO was substantially weaker on bimetallic samples than on the corresponding monometallic ones."

[7] "Our results indicate that regardless of the pretreatment conditions, the CO adsorbed on the Pt sites of the PtRu/SiO2 samples (band at approximately 2070 cm1) is weakly bound to the surface."

[8] "The results indicate that the presence of Pt stabilizes Ru and prevents its sintering during exposure to oxidizing conditions. Furthermore, the strength of the CO adsorption on the bimetallic samples is lower than that on the monometallic counterparts, presumably due to the presence of bimetallic interactions between Pt and Ru."

[9] "Complete conversion of CO was never achieved with the PtRu/SiO2 sample that underwent O2/H2 treatment at 300C. As shown in Fig. 4, the CO conversion decreased immediately after reaching its maximum value of approximately 95% at 140C. Once again, this may be due to the decrease strength of CO adsorption, at elevated temperatures."

[10] "The high activity and selectivity of these monometallic catalysts in PROX is often related to the saturation of metal surfaces by CO, which prevents H2 adsorption and oxidation"

[11] "The lower strength of CO adsorption in the case of the PtRu sample could promote the oxidation of CO on Pt."

[1] "Among the reported heterogeneous catalysts so far for the CO oxidation, PROX reaction and cathodic materials of the PEM fuel cells, supported Pt-Fe nanoparticles prepared by one improved method have been investigated by several groups"

[2] "They proposed a so-called bifunctional mechanism and pointed out that the mechanism was clearly different to that of the PROX reaction on Au catalysts supported on TiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2"

[3] "Up to know, a noncompetitive dual site mechanism has been proposed for the PROX reaction over the supported bimetallic Pt-Fe catalyst"

[4] "It means that platinum site in Pto state acts as CO adsorption site and iron site in FeOx or Feo state as an O2 dissociative-adsorption site enhances the surface reaction between the reactants on the neighboring sites."

[5] "Very recently, Siani et al. reported the silica-supported Pt, PtFe2 and Pt5Fe2 catalysts prepared from PtFe2(COD)(CO)8 (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) and Pt5Fe2(COD)2(CO)12 organometallic cluster precursors, respectively"

[6] "The cluster-derived PtFe/SiO2 catalyst showed improved CO oxidation activity in the presence and absence of hydrogen as compared to that prepared by the conventional methods."

[1] "Pt-based intermetallic compounds (IMCs) supported on silica were studied as a catalyst for the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess hydrogen to obtain the active catalyst at low temperatures."

[2] "Pt3Co/SiO2 and PtCu/SiO2 were more active than Pt/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 in the temperature range of 373453 K."

[3] "Infrared (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and adsorption measurements revealed a significant electron transfer from Pt atoms to Co or Cu atoms. The electron-deficient Pt atoms adsorbed CO weakly compared with Pt metal, accelerating the adsorption of oxygen on the IMC surface."

[4] "Kinetic studies indicated that Co and Cu atoms in IMCs also adsorb oxygen. This improved oxygen adsorption likely resulted in the high PROX activity at low temperatures."

[5] "The reaction proceeded through the LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism, as has been proposed on PtFe/mordenite"

[6] "On PtCu/SiO2, however, CO conversion increased by 30% with the addition of hydrogen and even further by the addition of water. The enhancing effect of hydrogen reflected the contribution of water produced by the oxidation of hydrogen during the PROX reaction."

[7] "The CO molecules on Pt would be oxidized by oxygen atoms activated on Co, resulting in higher activity of Pt3Co compared with Pt metal."

[1] "Modification of Pt/SiO2 with ReOx species enhanced the catalytic activity of the CO oxidation with O2 in the presence of H2."

          [2] "The promoting effect of Re species appeared after the reduction above 673 K."

          [3] "The reduced PtReOx/SiO2 (Re/Pt = 0.5) has high O2 activation ability even when the CO adsorption on the Pt surface atoms is saturated, and this property is caused by the reduced Re species."

          [4] "Under the PROX condition, the reduced state of Re species can be maintained by the presence of H2. The reduced ReOx species can activate O2, and the activated oxygen and oxidizing species are supplied from Re species to the Pt metal surface; as a result, the coverage of oxidizing species is increased and that of adsorbed CO is decreased."

          [5] "Characterization of the reduced PtReOx/SiO2 catalyst by means of EXAFS, XANES, temperature-programmed reduction, and CO adsorption measurements suggested the formation of the ReOx clusters on the surface of Pt metal particles with the average valence of Re of +2.7."

          [6] "These tendencies can be explained by the mechanism where the reduced ReOx species activates O2 and the oxidizing species is spilled over from the ReOx species to the Pt surface."

[1] "The activity over PdPt/Al2O3 was greater than that over Pd/Al2O3 after 6.6 h for the conditions used in this study."

[2] "The activity of PdPt/Al2O3 increased with time. Results from TPO, XRD, XPS, and TEM indicate that the increase was due to significantly greater PdO production during operation."

[3] "The morphology of the noble metal particles in PdPt/Al2O3 consisted of two parts, one rich in PdO and the other consisting of an alloy between Pd and Pt. These two parts were always found in close contact."

[4] "For the oxidation reaction of methane, stable conversion was observed only for the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst, where both metallic Pd and PdO coexist on the surface, whereas for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, all Pd transformed into PdO over time."

[5] "The thermal aging was worse for Pd/Al2O3 than for PdPt/Al2O3. Thus, Pt prevents the aging of Pd catalysts."

"Among them AuPt/CeO2 catalyst shows the highest activity with 78% conversion of CO at 250 C."

"The activity increases obviously with Pt loadings in AuPt/CeO2. For example, CO conversion is only 8.9% at 200 C for Au/CeO2 catalyst. When the Pt loading reaches 0.5%, 1%, and 2%, CO conversion improves to 37.6%, 46.5% and 54.1%, respectively."

"For bimetallic AuPt/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles emerges at 145 C and the low-temperature reduction peak of ceria is shifted to at Tmax = 390 C. These results indicated that the coexistence of both Au and Pt is beneficial to the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles and the reduction of surface ceria."

"Besides, the concentration of the surface oxygen of ceria obviously increases in the presence of Pt. It causes the formation of oxygen vacancies, located mainly on the catalyst surface. This is why the bimetallic Au and Pt catalysts possess the higher WGS reaction activity than monometallic Au/CeO2 or Pt/CeO2 catalyst."

"The addition of Pt is conducive to the formation of Auδ+ because of the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band, accompanied by intraatomic charge redistributions. The presence of both metallic and ionic gold species, the high concentration of surface oxygen as well as the low degree of Ce3+ surface defects determine simultaneously the WGS reaction activity of the bimetallic AuPt catalyst."

"It is found that the introduction of platinum in AuPt/CeO2 catalyst is responsible for the formation of partly oxidized gold species probably due to the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band."

"The presence of both gold and platinum is beneficial to the reduction of ceria to Ce3+ species as well as the creation of oxygen vacancies and makes the average size of ceria smaller."

[1] "Addition of Pt progressively promotes thermal decomposition and chemical reduction (by CH4) of PdO. On increasing the Pt/Pd ratio oxidation of metallic Pd is also progressively inhibited, being completely hindered for the Pt/Pd-1 sample."

[2] "Repeated Pd reduction/re-oxidation cycles are effective in increasing catalytic activity of Pt/Pd-0 and Pt/Pd-0.10 samples: these systems exhibit a marked activation during the conditioning process up to the highest levels among the catalysts tested in this work."

[3] "The correlation of PdO reducibility to CH4 combustion activity which is observed in monometallic catalyst, in line with a redox mechanism kinetically controlled by the reduction step, does not apply in the case of bimetallic samples."

[4] "As a whole, the effect of Pt on PdO CH4 combustion activity is not straightforward. Depending on several factors, such as the extent of PdO formation, the strength of Pd–support interactions, the stabilization of metallic Pd, Pt may act as an inhibitor or a promoter of catalytic activity."

[1] "The PtCu catalyst showed lower H2 yield in WGS compared to the Cu catalyst, but it exhibited higher H2 yield in OWGS, and extent of the enhancement by O2 addition (difference between OWGS and WGS) is similar to PdCu catalyst."

[2] "The combination of Pt and Cu lowers the reduction temperature of Cu giving a single peak at around 148 C. This suggests that Pt and Cu interact and each makes the other more reducible."

[3] "Fits of Pt(1)Cu(5)/CeO2 showed completely different environment around Pt from Pt(1)/CeO2, i.e., Pt has 6 Cu neighbors at 2.54 Å and 3 Pt neighbors at 2.75 Å. The higher Pt coordination to Cu than to Pt indicates high dispersion of Pt in Cu, probably forming PtCu alloy."

[4] "It was proposed that the O2 addition partially oxidizes chemisorbed CO leading to vacant sites for H2O adsorption and reaction."

[5] "Ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, such as PtCu and PdCu, exhibited higher OWGS activity than monometallic catalysts while the superiority of bimetallic catalysts was not as pronounced in WGS."

[6] "The TPR and OSC measurements revealed the existence of strong interaction between Pt and Cu or between Pd and Cu, which makes the bimetallic catalyst more resistant toward oxidation (less pyrophoric)."

[7] "EXAFS spectra indicated that Cu forms alloys with Pt and with Pd."

[8] "The presence of Cu in PdCu/CeO2 facilitates CO2 desorption, decreasing the amount of surface carbonate on CeO2."

[1] "Effects of methane oxygen mixture addition to steam reforming of methane and subsequent removal of the methane oxygen mixture from the oxidative steam reforming of methane on catalytic performance were investigated using monometallic Ni and Pt catalysts and two PtNi bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "Hysteresis with respect to the addition and removal of the methane oxygen mixture was observed clearly on a PtNi bimetallic catalyst prepared by co-impregnation method and the Ni catalyst. In contrast, no hysteresis was observed for a PtNi catalyst that was prepared by sequential impregnation method."

[3] "PtNi catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation is formed PtNi alloy particles, where Pt atoms are segregated on the surface, enhances the reducibility of Ni drastically and this is related to the behavior without hysteresis."

[4] "Characterization of results using Pt L3-edge and Ni K-edge EXAFS analysis and FTIR of CO adsorption suggest that the PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated to the surface can be formed on the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6), which might be related to the lack of hysteresis behavior by high reducibility and the suppression of the deep oxidation of Ni species."

[5] "In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the temperature over the catalyst bed inlet is high. However, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase than other catalysts, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone."

[1] "Bimetallic catalysts often present superior catalytic performance in comparison to their parent metals and have been widely used in many catalytic processes."

          [2] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."

          [3] "The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunabiity in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

"The key for the improvement of the CO oxidation rate is to allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2. New catalyst formulations are being developed towards supplying these catalysts with an additional site for oxygen adsorption, which will enhance the reaction rate, by addition of a promoter"

"An example of this development is the addition of Fe as a promoter for Pt catalysts. The Pt serves as the site for CO adsorption, whereas the Fe oxide promoter dissociates the O2 molecule, resulting in a non-competitive, dual-site mechanism."

"MnOx is reported as high oxygen storage capacity compound. MnOx has been studied in oxidation reactions and as support for Au catalyst in the PROX reaction. MnOx-doped Pt catalysts have been studied for automotive pollution control and for CO oxidation (in H2-free streams)."

"Comparing the PROX behavior of all catalysts in Fig. 5(a), we can see that those with a higher content in MnOx (P1M8ASI and P1M15ASI) are more active than Pt/Al2O3, with the following order of activity: P1M15ASI > P1M8ASI > P1A > P1M2ASI > M2P1ASI ≈ P1M2ACI ≈ M2A."

"While the WGS reaction is beneficial in its forward direction, methanation reactions are always detrimental and should be avoided."

[1] "Chen et al. [11] studied the promoting effect of Pt, Pd and Rh in Ni0.03Mg0.97O catalysts for CO2-reforming. They found that the noble metal addition improves the catalyst stability and reducibility."

[2] "Pawelec et al. [3] reported that, in bimetallic PtNi catalysts supported on ZSM-5 for DRM, the presence of Pt (0.5%) leads to the formation of small and reducible nano-sized NiO particles. They also observed an improvement in the catalytic activity and stability, which was attributed to an increase in the nickel metallic dispersion caused by intimate contact between nickel and platinum."

[3] "Activity tests demonstrated that Pt presence and the use of the nanofibrous support in Ni catalysts improve CH4 and CO2 conversions, reaching values close to equilibrium. Moreover, Pt inhibits coke deposition and reduces the operation temperature."

[4] "From stability tests it can be concluded that Pt enhances the stability of Ni-based catalysts for DRM."

[5] "The addition of Pt modifies the Ni ensembles, by a synergic effect, varying the dissociative adsorption capacity of methane and consequently reducing the net carbon formation. This fact together with the ability of Pt to remove carbon by CO2 could produce differences between the rates of carbon deposition and gasification by CO2; at higher Pt content, higher carbon gasification and less net carbon formation."

[6] "The carbon formation in the DRM occurs via two reactions: methane decomposition and CO disproportionation reactions. Methane decomposition is a structure-sensitivity reaction, which can be inhibited by controlling the catalyst surface structure. Apparently, the Pt incorporation not only conditions the Ni0 particles size, but also avoids the Ni encapsulation by carbon."

[1] "The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was shown to enhance the watergas shift (WGS) rate compared with the rate observed with Pt alone supported on either Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 at similar Pt weight loadings."

[2] "The results from CO chemisorption showed that the Pt was more highly dispersed on Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 than on the Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[3] "The WGS rate was observed to be proportional to the exposed Pt surface area for the Pt-Re and Pt catalysts; however, the rate per m2 of exposed Pt for Pt-Re/ Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was higher than that of Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[4] "The difference in the rates upon the addition of Re to Pt WGS catalysts suggests that the role of Re in enhancing the WGS activity of Pt is more complex than to just increase the Pt dispersion."

[5] "If the only function of Re was to increase the Pt dispersion, one would expect the same WGS activity for both Pt and Pt-Re catalysts."

[6] "A bifunctional redox mechanism is used to explain this synergism. In this mechanism, CO is adsorbed on the platinum, then oxygen is transferred from the ceria to the platinum, where the CO is oxidized (CO2) and the ceria is reduced (Ce4+  Ce3+); finally, the reduced ceria is reoxidized (Ce3+  Ce4+) by the dissociative adsorption of H2O, releasing H2 in the process."

[1] "Besides, in the bimetallic catalysts, there is a Pt-Ni interaction between metallic centers, which enhances the catalyst stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO."

[2] "It is interesting to point out that, in the Ni containing catalysts the Ni0/NiAl2O4 and the Ni0/NiO ratios increased when Pt was incorporated and when the catalysts were prepared by ME, as can be observed in Table 5."

[3] "Characterization results indicate that the incorporation of Pt in Ni-based catalyst has a great influence on the Ni species distribution, the Ni particle size and dispersion, in addition to the net carbon formation. In the bimetallic PtNi catalyst there is a synergic effect between PtNi which modifies the Ni disposition, as well as its reducibility by the spillover of hydrogen from Pt to Ni"

[4] "Adding Pt and/or preparing the catalysts by ME the Ni0 and Pt0 particles size can be controlled and the metal encapsulation by carbon avoided. The activity and stability of the PtNi nanocatalysts is improved when the metal ensembles have similar dimensions to the fibers of the support, which avoids metal sintering and the insertion of Ni into the alumina structure."

[5] "Monometallic and bimetallic PtNi catalysts prepared by ME and supported on the nanofibrous alumina seem to be successful catalysts for the DRM, with high selectivity towards H2/CO and low towards coke."

[1] "The catalyst is 0.5% Ru and 0.5% Pt (w/w) supported on mixture of alumina, ceria and zirconia (75/4.4/20.6%, w/w), washcoated on a ceramic monolith."

[2] "We already studied the activity of this 0.5/0.5% Pt/Ru catalyst for partial oxidation, speculating that combustion and reforming of methane occurs sequentially, and that is clearly identified also by tests on the global reaction, without studying each single reaction in the mechanism."

[3] "Through specific tests with selected mixtures, we proved that the PtRu catalyst supports the indirect combustion and reforming mechanism in CPO, as already suggested in a previous work."

[4] "The catalyst was active in catalysing all the candidate reactions (steam reforming, dry reforming and direct/reverse water-gas shift)."

[5] "Both the direct and the reverse water-gas shift reactions are very fast and not affected by the gas space velocity. They approach the thermodynamic equilibrium, with the direct reaction being more relevant for the global mechanism at low temperature, while the reverse reaction becomes more important at high temperature."

[6] "The steam reforming tests showed that this reaction gives a considerable contribution mainly at the lowest GHSV, explaining the differences in the conversions detected during CPO tests."

[7] "Results indicate that the PtRu catalyst is active also for dry reforming, significantly converting both CO2 and CH4 to H2 and CO."

[1] "The catalytic data reported here show that the monometallic 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is slightly more active than the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the dry reforming of methane, in spite of the smaller metal content, in agreement with the intrinsically higher activity of platinum with respect to nickel in the reaction."

[2] "However, an improvement in the catalyst activity can be obtained not only by introducing a small amount of Pt on the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst) but also adding a significant amount of Ni to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst)."

[3] "It is evident that some kind of synergy occurs between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, improving DRM activity, in terms of conversion. Thus, these elements have a mutual role of activators for each other."

[4] "However, the most relevant effect that can also have practical application is that the addition of small amounts of Pt significantly decreases the deactivation rate of the catalyst (as discussed in detail elsewhere [28]) by reducing the formation of carbon nanotubes."

[5] "IR spectra of adsorbed CO confirm that a solid solution occurs, indicating that the surface appears to be dominated by Pt centers whose electron-withdrawing character is increased by nickel."

[6] "The formation of PtNi alloy, which is enriched at the surface by Pt and has smaller metal crystal size than metal particles in monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts. The alloy formation is associated with higher activity and lower production of carbonaceous materials upon dry reforming of methane."

[7] "The addition of platinum, however, favors the formation of even smaller metal particles with respect to pure nickel, thus increasing significantly the electron-withdrawing ability of Pt centers."

[8] "The presence of such particles modifies the chemical behavior of Ni, increasing its reducibility as shown by XPS data as well as by Temperature-Programmed Reduction results"

[1] "At present there are few UHV studies of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. The overview will therefore focus primarily on reactor studies, with the anticipation that the intriguing properties of these catalysts would inspire future UHV studies to correlate model surfaces with supported catalysts."

[2] "The oxidation of CO is also studied on Fe/Pt(111), with the bimetallic surface structures being reversibly controlled between FeO/Pt(111) and subsurface PtFePt(111) via alternating oxidation and reduction treatments."

[3] "PtFe/γ-Al2O3, PtFe2/γ-Al2O3, and PtFe3/γ-Al2O3 outperform Pt/γ-Al2O3 for the PROX of CO in a combined stream of CO and H2."

[4] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are active for the WGS reaction and show enhanced activity when alloyed with Re, Co, and Au."

[5] "PtCo catalysts have been shown to convert methane into C2+ products with higher conversion than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

[6] "PtNi supported on MgAl2O4 exhibits self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics. Without prereduction, the PtNi bimetallic catalyst dissociates CH4 under reaction conditions to form hydrogen, which spills over and reduces other metallic particles on the catalyst."

[1] "Previous study has shown that a bimetallic PdPt catalyst neither behaves as a Pd catalyst nor as a Pt catalyst during methane combustion"

[2] "Incorporation of platinum into the palladium catalyst prevents the drop of methane conversion."

[3] "The steady-state tests showed a major decrease in activity with time-on-stream for the palladium catalyst. Hence, for any practical application it will be of paramount importance to improve the stability of methane conversion."

[4] "All bimetallic catalysts gave significantly more stable methane conversion compared to the monometallic catalyst during operation at steady state."

[5] "The nature of the support material affects the combustion performance of the bimetallic PdPt catalysts."

[6] "All PdPt catalysts, independently of the support, have considerably more stable methane conversion than the monometallic palladium catalyst."

[7] "PdPtAl2O3 was the most active catalyst in the low-temperature region, PdPt supported on ceria-stabilised ZrO2 was the most active between 620 and 800 C, whereas PdPt supported on LaMnAl11O19 was superior for temperatures above 800 C."

[8] "The bimetallic catalysts show strong reflections located between the 2θ values of Pd0 and Pt0, i.e. between of 40.115 and 39.889. This indicates a close interaction between the two metals."

[9] "PdPtCeZrO2 is the most active of the bimetallic catalysts in the steady-state test at temperatures above 620 C."

[10] "The drop in the methane conversion during the PdO decomposition was suppressed for the ZrO2-based catalysts compared to the Al2O3-based catalysts."

[11] "The bimetallic catalysts had a molar ratio of 2:1 Pd:Pt."

[12] "The activity of the bimetallic catalysts increases with time-on-stream, probably due to PdO formation during operation."

[13] "Both the TPO profile and the in situ XRD diffractograms suggest that PdPtCeZrO2 reoxidises Pd very easily during cooling."

[1] "The combined effect of Ni and Pt can produce a coke-resistant catalyst."

[2] "The results demonstrated that the bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalyst showed lower activity (e.g., NiPtY and NiPtβ activities were 1.70 and 1.90 gmetal1 h1, respectively) than that of the monometallic Pt/zeolite catalyst (e.g., PtY and Ptβ activities were close to 2.0 and 3.20 gmetal1 h1, respectively)."

[3] "The behaviour of NiPt bimetallic samples is quite similar to that of Ptβ; in others words, NiPtY and NiPtβ produce a large amount of graphite-like carbon and a small amount of filamentous carbon."

[4] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts can also be explained by the fact that the presence of a second metal such as platinum exposes the nickel to the reactants, meaning a redispersion of Ni occurs due to the addition/dispersion of a second metal, e.g., platinum"

[5] "In addition, in the case of NiPt bimetallic systems, the rate of decomposition of methane is slower than that on monometallic nickel systems. This is explained by the large lability of the type of carbon species formed on the bimetallic samples."

[6] "Pt dispersed on BEA zeolite produced lower carbon deposition (16 wt%) and this coke was easily removed by CO2."

[7] "The mechanistic investigations reveal that the dispersion of carbon during the dry reforming of methane is the result of a number of adsorption and elementary chemical steps. First, methane cracking and Boudouard reactions (reactions (VIII) and (XIX)) produce surface carbon on the Ni particles embedded in the support. Second, the diffusion of carbon through the Ni particles occurs, followed by segregation at the rear. Finally, the Ni particle is lifted from the support by a growing carbon filament."

[1] "As compared to their Pt and Co monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and allow the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures to be reduced from 1 to 103 vol %."

          [2] "This effect is likely due to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface."

[1] "A series of PtNi bimetallic catalysts supported on δ-Al2O3 to be used in carbon dioxide reforming of methane was prepared and tested with the objective of optimizing the Ni/Pt metal composition to obtain high activity and stability."

[2] "The activity results showed that the catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples strongly depended on the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio."

[3] "Among all the catalysts, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, which has the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability."

[4] "The combined characterization and catalyst performance tests results reveal that low Ni/Pt molar loading ratio of 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 sample led to a relatively easy reduction of nickel oxide species and smaller nano-sized nickel particles having better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites in the closed vicinity."

[5] "The results of the combined dry reforming and partial oxidation tests strongly indicated a change in surface reaction mechanism depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts."

[6] "The changes in the catalysts activity and stability under the presence of an additional oxygen source were determined through addition of small amounts of either oxygen or water vapor to the feed stream."

[1] "Platinumtin bimetallic catalysts are of interest for selective oxidation and reduction reactions, and are commercially important for petroleum reforming"

[2] "Compared to Pt catalysts, PtSn reforming catalysts have greater resistance to coking and increased selectivity to aromatics."

[3] "It has been reported that on alumina, tin is partially oxidized to create a mixed catalyst with a supported alloy phase PtSn/Al2O3 and a tin oxide-supported, Pt-phase Pt/SnOx/Al2O3, where the relative concentrations are determined mainly by particle size"

[4] "Specifically, the effect of tin oxidation on the kinetics of CO oxidation by O2 on an α-Al2O3 supported, PtSn catalyst has been studied by Grass and Lintz"

[5] "Industrial, supported, PtSn catalysts, however, include an oxide support material and are complicated materials systems for which it is difficult to assess the phases present and the catalytic activity of each phase."

[1] "Among a number of catalysts reported to be active for PROX, supported platinum catalysts have been considered to be promising in view of their high catalytic performance."

[2] "PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a H2-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K."

[3] "The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity."

[4] "For CO oxidation, it has been proposed that the lattice oxygen and interfacial metalsupport interaction play a crucial role in promoting CO oxidation when metal species are supported on an oxygen-ion-conducting support."

[5] "Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted to try to determine the interactions between Pt and Co, as well as those between Pt, Co oxides (CoOx), and YSZ"

[6] "Three main reactions take place in this system. The reaction that competes most effectively with CO oxidation [Eq.(1)] is H2 oxidation [Eq.(2)] because of the H2-rich conditions in the gas stream in practical fuel cell applications. In addition, CO can consume additional H2 by undergoing hydrogenation [Eq.(3)], a process also known as methanation, which should be avoided unless the CO concentration in the reactant stream is quite low, because it consumes relatively large amounts of hydrogen (3mol per mol CO)."

[1] "PtFe/SiO2 samples were found to be more active than monometallic Pt/SiO2 for the oxidation of CO in air. This enhancement of the catalytic activity strongly depends on the degree of electronic interaction between the metals and the strength of CO adsorption."

          [2] "Our FTIR data show that the sample with the highest activity for CO oxidation was also characterized by a relatively low strength of CO adsorption."

          [3] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that direct contact between Pt and Fe is essential for the enhancement of the Pt activity for the oxidation of CO, as we proposed earlier. Furthermore, our results suggest that such direct contact is better achieved at low Fe contents and leads to a weakening of the adsorption of CO on Pt, which in turn, enhances the rate of CO oxidation."

          [4] "The presence of PtFe bimetallic interactions and the transfer of electron density from Fe to Pt are important factors influencing the final density of states and affecting the repulsive interactions between adsorbing CO molecules and surface metal adsorption sites."

          [5] "The close proximity between Pt and Fe in such sites leads to the reduction of Fe, which can be active for cyclohexane dehydrogenation."

          [6] "Furthermore, PtFe adsorption sites could favor the di-σCO mode of adsorption for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, thus promoting the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond and the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols."

[1] "The modification of Ni with Pt suppressed the oxidation of Ni species near the bed inlet in the oxidative steam reforming of methane at 1123 K, although the species on the monometallic Ni catalysts were oxidized under similar conditions."

[2] "This can be due to the decreased oxidation rate of the species and the increased reduction rate caused by the surface modification of Ni with Pt."

[3] "Consequently, the PtNi species can be maintained in the metallic state near the bed inlet, and the species can be the active site for the reforming reaction as well as the combustion reaction, which this leads to a lower bed temperature and smaller temperature gradient than those seen for the monometallic Ni catalysts."

[4] "The additive effect of Pt by the sequential impregnation method (Pt/Ni) was much more significant than that by the co-impregnation method (Pt + Ni) in terms of catalytic performance and catalyst bed temperature profile."

[5] "The combination of EXAFS and FTIR results suggests segregation of Pt atoms on the surface of the PtNi alloy particles."

[6] "Characterization results by means of TEM, TPR, EXAFS, and FTIR suggest that the Pt atoms on the Pt/Ni catalysts were located more preferably on the surface to form a PtNi alloy than those on the Pt + Ni catalysts."

[1] "It has been reported that, after reduction, the metallic Pt and Sn formed are predominantly PtSn alloys with hydroxy groups on Pt/SnOx, which are involved in CO oxidation"

[2] "The results reported clearly show the catalytic CO oxidation activity at lower temperatures when the Pt3Sn alloy phase is present in these catalysts"

[3] "Of the two Pt alloys, PtSn and Pt3Sn, the Pt rich Pt3Sn can adsorb oxygen more readily at lower temperatures than PtSn"

[4] "The intimate contact between the metallic phase and the SnOx interface may be another factor which plays a role in the enhanced adsorption ability and the CO oxidation activity"

[5] "It has been proposed in the literature that the CO oxidation reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and adsorbed O"

[6] "The results indicate the beneficial use of AC supports rich in surface oxygen bearing groups, which lead to the formation of Pt-rich alloys without an additional oxidation step of the catalyst after reduction."

[7] "The activity of PtSn/AC catalysts in CO oxidation reaction is strongly affected by the surface chemistry of the support, the preparation method of the catalyst, the Pt:Sn ratio and the reduction procedure applied."

[1] "Many studies have been made on the approach of combinatorial catalysis especially Pt and Pd for CO oxidation reaction [10]. Using bimetallic system is an attractive alternative that appears to enhance some properties of the catalyst or some synergistic effect as electronic effect/geometry effect."

[2] "Although it is still not yet well understood, it has been established that the bimetallic system improves both activity and selectivity of a great number of reactions [11,12]."

[3] "Narui et al. [17] attributed the superior combustion activity of PdPt to higher dispersion of supported particles and suppression of particle growth."

[4] "The catalytic activity was obviously increased with the increasing content of Pd. However, the results at a ratio of Pt: Pd = 1: 9 evidenced that it was not necessary to load Pd in very high loadings. The catalyst with a ratio of Pt: Pd = 1: 7 showed the best performance, 76% CO conversion and 55% selectivity and at 90.110 C."

[5] "When increasing the O2 concentration to twice the stoichiometric ratio of the oxygen concentration (1% O2 ), the CO conversion increased to 76% at 90.110 C. Ninty nine percent CO conversion of 1% CO at 90 C can be achieved by increasing the oxygen concentration to 2%."

[6] "An enhancement of CO oxidation reaction can be apparently observed when adding 10% water vapor in the feed. At 90 C, when there was no water vapor in the feed stream the CO conversion was about 76% and when adding 10% water vapor in the feed stream the CO conversion was increased to 85%."

[7] "The CO conversion substantially dropped from 76% to 50% at 90.110 C when increasing CO2 concentration in the feed stream. The presence of CO2 also affected the selectivity in the temperature range of 50.190 C."

[8] "One was that water enhances the water gas shift reaction and as a result more CO was converted into CO2, the second possibility was that the hydroxyl group formed on the catalyst upon adsorption of water was a better oxidation than oxygen and increases the oxidation rate of CO and hydrogen [18]."

[9] "As compared to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of water in the feed enhances the CO oxidation rate [6,22]."

[1] "The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts; however a different addition manner was suggested for the later acceleration effect over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts."

[2] "The activity of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts was strongly affected by the Re content, while the activity of PtRe/TiO2 catalysts was less dependent on the addition ratio of Re, and more dependent on the temperature of reduction."

[3] "The FT-IR analyses of the adsorbed species during the reaction exhibited the enhancement of the adsorbed CO peaks in lower wavenumber region with the increase of Re content. Accordingly, Re is supposed to have some effect on these adsorbed CO, which accelerates the WGS reaction, especially in the case of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts."

[4] "WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction."

[5] "The role of Re would be the stabilization of formate species and accelerate the rate of H2 formation."

[6] "PtRe/TiO2 system is known as a good catalyst showing activity close to Cu catalysts in low temperature"

[7] "Under LTR condition, the change of the CO concentration only started at around 373 K; the most active catalysts was PtRe(2:0)/TiO2, and the addition of Re affected the reaction rate negatively."

[1] "Our recent studies [21], [22] evidenced ruthenium as a good catalyst for CPO, though its stability needs to be improved and wide hysteresis cycles are observed while varying reaction temperature, apparently connected to the ease with which Ru is reduced and oxidized."

[2] "Conversely, Pt hardly undergoes redox reactions and it has some activity for CPO as well [23], [25]. In this work we present results of combining Pt and Ru on a bimetallic catalyst that showed good activity and selectivity towards CPO products and a much better stability than monometallic Ru."

[3] "The behavior of the bimetallic catalyst is similar to that of monometallic Pt at low T's, approaching monometallic Ru as the temperature rises. Interestingly, this feature implies that suitable proportions of Pt and Ru can determine the CO/H2 ratio at a given T."

[4] "Summarizing, we can conclude that Pt improves the stability of the catalyst preventing or limiting the Ru redox behavior. Conversely, a lower GHSV is required to achieve higher CO/H2 yields."

[5] "We developed a more efficient and stable catalyst for syngas production from methane. We combined the best features of Pt that activates methane at low temperature and those of Ru that is very selective towards CPO products."

[6] "Pt stabilizes Ru, limiting redox reactions during the heating and cooling cycles. The small residual hysteresis is likely caused by thermal effects and not by chemistry (reduction/oxidation reactions). The light-off temperature is also lower than for monometallic ruthenium, but the catalyst starts converting reactants following mainly total oxidation stoichiometry."

[7] "As temperature increases, CPO products clearly prevail and their ratio stabilizes at a value suitable for Fisher–Tropsch applications (H2/CO2 = 2). Even if not tested for many tens of hours, the catalyst did not show any marked aging effects, keeping its activity almost unchanged."

[1] "Selective CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over supported Pt catalysts promoted with various transition metal compounds such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Zr."

[2] "Among them, Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 showed high CO conversions over wide reaction temperatures."

[3] "The catalytic activity at low temperatures increased with increasing the molar ratio of Ni/Pt. This accompanied the TPR peak shift to lower temperatures."

[4] "The bimetallic phase of Pt-Ni seems to give rise to stable activity with high CO2 selectivity in selective oxidation of CO in H2-rich stream."

[1] "The co-impregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 was superior to Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/Pt/γ-Al2O3 prepared by a sequential impregnation of each component on alumina support."

          [2] "As the reduction temperature increased above 423 K, the CO2 selectivity decreased and the atomic percent of Ni in the bimetallic phase of PtNi increased."

          [3] "This catalyst exhibited the high CO conversion even in the presence of 2% H2O and 20% CO2 over a wide reaction temperature."

          [4] "The bimetallic phase of PtNi seems to give rise to high catalytic activity for the PROX in H2-rich stream."
