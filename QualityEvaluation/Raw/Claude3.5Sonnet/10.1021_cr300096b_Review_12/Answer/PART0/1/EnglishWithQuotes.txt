Improved stability: Pt stabilizes Ru by limiting redox reactions during temperature cycles, reducing hysteresis and improving overall stability compared to monometallic Ru catalysts.\n\n2. Lower light-off temperature: The bimetallic catalyst activates methane conversion at a lower temperature than monometallic Ru, though initially following total oxidation stoichiometry.\n\n3. Temperature-dependent behavior: At low temperatures, the catalyst behaves similarly to monometallic Pt, while at higher temperatures, it approaches the behavior of monometallic Ru.\n\n4. Reaction pathway: As temperature increases, partial oxidation products (CO and H2) become dominant, reaching a ratio suitable for Fischer-Tropsch applications (H2/CO = 2).\n\n5.

Reduced aging effects: The bimetallic catalyst shows minimal aging effects, maintaining its activity over time.\n\n7. Synergistic effects: The catalyst combines Pt's ability to activate methane at low temperatures with Ru's high selectivity towards CPO products.\n\n8.
