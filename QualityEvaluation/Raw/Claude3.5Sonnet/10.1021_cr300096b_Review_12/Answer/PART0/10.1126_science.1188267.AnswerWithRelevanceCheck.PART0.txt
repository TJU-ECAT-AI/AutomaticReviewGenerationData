          [1] "On the basis of surface science measurements, density functional calculations, and catalytic reactions under realistic conditions, we describe here a strategy to achieve this goal that takes advantage of the confinement effect at interfaces between nanostructured ferrous oxides (FeO) and metal (Pt) substrates."

[2] "Catalytic reaction experiments on the supported Pt-Fe catalysts prepared by a dedicated and reproducible synthesis method show that the identified ensemble is highly active, selective, and robust for CO oxidation, even under operating conditions of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)."

[3] "Among various model systems considered, the FeO1-x/Pt(111) surface presents the highest reactivity because of the presence of the CUF sites."

[4] "For the Pt/SiO2 catalysts, CO conversion is negligible below RT, but increases slowly with temperature. At 473 K, only 70% CO was reacted off. In contrast, the Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts show a high activity, with almost 100% CO conversion and 100% CO selectivity at RT."

[5] "Depending on the CUF sites, O2 may either dissociate directly to atomic O without barrier, or adsorb molecularly first with a binding energy of about 1.51 eV per O2 (Fig. 2A) and afterward dissociate to atomic O with a barrier of 0.42 eV [the corresponding transition state (TS) shown in Fig. 2B]."

[6] "CO oxidation on FeO1-x/Pt(111) might maintain its activity even in the presence of H2 because dissociative adsorption of H2 on Pt suffers from CO poisoning."

[7] "We show that the structural ensemble was highly efficient for carbon monoxide oxidation at low temperature under typical operating conditions of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell."

[8] "The interface-confined CUF sites together with the metal supports are active for dioxygen activation, producing reactive dissociated oxygen atoms."

[9] "Guided by these insights, we prepared Pt-Fe [4 weight percent (wt %) Pt, 0.5 wt % Fe] nanoparticles (NPs) and Pt (4 wt %) NPs supported on nanosized silica spheres."

[10] "CO PROX reactions under stoichiometric condition (1% CO and 0.5% O2, 98.5% H2, 0.1 M Pa, 36000 ml g1 h1) are conducted on the Pt-Fe/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts."

          The literature provides significant insights into how Pt-Fe bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation in reactor studies:

1. Mechanism: The catalytic activity is attributed to coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites at the interface between nanostructured ferrous oxides (FeO) and platinum (Pt) substrates. These CUF sites, along with neighboring Pt atoms, are highly active for O2 activation and CO oxidation.

2. Efficiency: Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts show significantly higher activity for CO oxidation compared to Pt/SiO2 catalysts. At room temperature, Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalysts achieve almost 100% CO conversion and selectivity, while Pt/SiO2 catalysts show negligible activity.

3. Reaction conditions: The Pt-Fe catalysts maintain high activity, selectivity, and robustness even under operating conditions of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). They also show potential for maintaining activity in the presence of H2.

4. O2 activation: Depending on the CUF sites, O2 may either dissociate directly without a barrier or adsorb molecularly before dissociating with a low energy barrier.

5. Preferential oxidation (PROX): The catalysts were also tested for CO PROX reactions in the presence of excess H2, demonstrating their potential for fuel cell applications.

The study does not directly address water gas shift reactions or methane conversions. However, future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by:

1. Investigating the behavior of these reactions on Pt-Fe model surfaces under controlled conditions.
2. Examining the role of CUF sites and interface effects in activating different reactants.
3. Studying the influence of reaction conditions on catalyst performance and stability.
4. Comparing results from model surfaces with supported catalysts to bridge the gap between UHV studies and real-world applications.

These studies could help correlate findings between model surfaces and supported catalysts, addressing current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. However, challenges remain in accurately replicating complex structures and conditions found in real catalytic systems within UHV environments.

          文献为Pt-Fe双金属催化剂如何影响反应器研究中CO氧化的机理和效率提供了重要见解：

1. 机理：催化活性归因于纳米结构亚铁氧化物（FeO）和铂（Pt）基底之间界面上的配位不饱和亚铁（CUF）位点。这些CUF位点与相邻的Pt原子一起，对O2活化和CO氧化具有高活性。

2. 效率：与Pt/SiO2催化剂相比，Pt-Fe/SiO2催化剂对CO氧化表现出显著更高的活性。在室温下，Pt-Fe/SiO2催化剂实现了近100%的CO转化率和选择性，而Pt/SiO2催化剂几乎没有活性。

3. 反应条件：Pt-Fe催化剂即使在质子交换膜燃料电池（PEMFC）的操作条件下也保持高活性、选择性和稳定性。它们还表现出在H2存在下保持活性的潜力。

4. O2活化：根据CUF位点的不同，O2可能直接解离而无障碍，或先分子吸附然后以低能垒解离。

5. 优先氧化（PROX）：催化剂还进行了过量H2存在下的CO PROX反应测试，展示了它们在燃料电池应用中的潜力。

该研究没有直接涉及水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化。然而，未来的UHV研究可能通过以下方式提供有价值的见解：

1. 在受控条件下研究这些反应在Pt-Fe模型表面上的行为。
2. 检查CUF位点和界面效应在活化不同反应物中的作用。
3. 研究反应条件对催化剂性能和稳定性的影响。
4. 比较模型表面和负载催化剂的结果，以弥合UHV研究和实际应用之间的差距。

这些研究可以帮助关联模型表面和负载催化剂之间的发现，解决当前UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的局限性。然而，在UHV环境中准确复制真实催化系统中发现的复杂结构和条件仍然存在挑战。
