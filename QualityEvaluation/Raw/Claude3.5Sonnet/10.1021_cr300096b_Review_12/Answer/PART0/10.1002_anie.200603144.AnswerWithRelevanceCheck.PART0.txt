          [1] "Among a number of catalysts reported to be active for PROX, supported platinum catalysts have been considered to be promising in view of their high catalytic performance."

[2] "PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a H2-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K."

[3] "The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity."

[4] "For CO oxidation, it has been proposed that the lattice oxygen and interfacial metalsupport interaction play a crucial role in promoting CO oxidation when metal species are supported on an oxygen-ion-conducting support."

[5] "Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted to try to determine the interactions between Pt and Co, as well as those between Pt, Co oxides (CoOx), and YSZ"

[6] "Three main reactions take place in this system. The reaction that competes most effectively with CO oxidation [Eq.(1)] is H2 oxidation [Eq.(2)] because of the H2-rich conditions in the gas stream in practical fuel cell applications. In addition, CO can consume additional H2 by undergoing hydrogenation [Eq.(3)], a process also known as methanation, which should be avoided unless the CO concentration in the reactant stream is quite low, because it consumes relatively large amounts of hydrogen (3mol per mol CO)."

          Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones like PtCo, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. PtCo bimetallic catalysts supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) demonstrate high efficiency for preferential CO oxidation (PROX) in hydrogen-rich streams, even with low Pt content (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K.

The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support. For CO oxidation, lattice oxygen and interfacial metal-support interactions play crucial roles when metal species are supported on oxygen-ion-conducting supports like YSZ.

The study used temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) to investigate the interactions between Pt, Co, and the YSZ support, providing insights into the formation and behavior of the bimetallic phase. This technique revealed the presence of new bimetallic PtCo oxides and their reduction at lower temperatures compared to monometallic catalysts.

In the catalytic system, three main reactions occur: CO oxidation, H2 oxidation, and CO hydrogenation (methanation). H2 oxidation competes most effectively with CO oxidation due to H2-rich conditions in practical fuel cell applications. Methanation should be avoided unless CO concentration is low, as it consumes large amounts of hydrogen.

While this research provides valuable insights from reactor studies, it does not directly address UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially offer more detailed information on atomic-scale interactions and surface chemistry, helping to correlate findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, UHV studies face limitations in replicating complex catalytic environments, particularly in terms of pressure and the presence of support materials. Bridging the gap between UHV studies and real catalytic conditions remains a challenge in correlating findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts.

          双金属催化剂，特别是以Pt为基础的催化剂（如PtCo），在反应器研究中显著影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机理和效率。以氧化钇稳定的氧化锆（YSZ）为载体的PtCo双金属催化剂在富氢气流中对优先CO氧化（PROX）表现出高效性，即使在低Pt含量（0.5wt%）和423K以下的温度下也是如此。

增强的催化活性归因于与载体相互作用的孤立双金属PtCo纳米粒子的存在。对于CO氧化，当金属物种被负载在氧离子导电载体（如YSZ）上时，晶格氧和金属-载体界面相互作用起着至关重要的作用。

研究使用温度程序还原（TPR）技术来研究Pt、Co和YSZ载体之间的相互作用，从而深入了解双金属相的形成和行为。这种技术揭示了新的双金属PtCo氧化物的存在，以及它们相比单金属催化剂在更低温度下的还原过程。

在催化系统中，主要发生三种反应：CO氧化、H2氧化和CO加氢（甲烷化）。由于实际燃料电池应用中富氢条件的存在，H2氧化最有效地与CO氧化竞争。除非CO浓度较低，否则应避免甲烷化，因为它消耗大量氢气。

虽然这项研究提供了反应器研究的宝贵见解，但它并未直接涉及Pt基双金属表面的超高真空（UHV）研究。未来的UHV研究可能会提供原子尺度相互作用和表面化学的更详细信息，有助于将反应器研究的发现与模型表面和负载催化剂相关联。然而，UHV研究在复制复杂的催化环境方面面临局限性，特别是在压力和载体材料存在的方面。弥合UHV研究与实际催化条件之间的差距仍然是将研究结果与模型表面和负载催化剂相关联的一个挑战。
