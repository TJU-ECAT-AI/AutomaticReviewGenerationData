          [1] "The combined effect of Ni and Pt can produce a coke-resistant catalyst."

[2] "The results demonstrated that the bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalyst showed lower activity (e.g., NiPtY and NiPtβ activities were 1.70 and 1.90 gmetal1 h1, respectively) than that of the monometallic Pt/zeolite catalyst (e.g., PtY and Ptβ activities were close to 2.0 and 3.20 gmetal1 h1, respectively)."

[3] "The behaviour of NiPt bimetallic samples is quite similar to that of Ptβ; in others words, NiPtY and NiPtβ produce a large amount of graphite-like carbon and a small amount of filamentous carbon."

[4] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts can also be explained by the fact that the presence of a second metal such as platinum exposes the nickel to the reactants, meaning a redispersion of Ni occurs due to the addition/dispersion of a second metal, e.g., platinum"

[5] "In addition, in the case of NiPt bimetallic systems, the rate of decomposition of methane is slower than that on monometallic nickel systems. This is explained by the large lability of the type of carbon species formed on the bimetallic samples."

[6] "Pt dispersed on BEA zeolite produced lower carbon deposition (16 wt%) and this coke was easily removed by CO2."

[7] "The mechanistic investigations reveal that the dispersion of carbon during the dry reforming of methane is the result of a number of adsorption and elementary chemical steps. First, methane cracking and Boudouard reactions (reactions (VIII) and (XIX)) produce surface carbon on the Ni particles embedded in the support. Second, the diffusion of carbon through the Ni particles occurs, followed by segregation at the rear. Finally, the Ni particle is lifted from the support by a growing carbon filament."

          Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly NiPt combinations, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversions in several ways:

1. Coke resistance: The combined effect of Ni and Pt produces a more coke-resistant catalyst compared to monometallic systems.

2. Activity: Bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalysts showed lower activity than monometallic Pt/zeolite catalysts for methane conversion.

3. Carbon formation: NiPt bimetallic catalysts produce more graphite-like carbon and less filamentous carbon compared to monometallic catalysts. Pt dispersed on BEA zeolite produced lower carbon deposition, which was easily removed by CO2.

4. Metal dispersion: The presence of Pt helps expose Ni to reactants by causing redispersion of Ni particles, enhancing catalytic activity.

5. Reaction rate: In NiPt bimetallic systems, the rate of methane decomposition is slower than on monometallic nickel systems, attributed to the higher lability of carbon species formed on bimetallic samples.

6. Mechanistic insights: The carbon formation during methane dry reforming involves several steps, including methane cracking, carbon diffusion through metal particles, and carbon filament growth.

While these reactor studies provide valuable insights, UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could offer more detailed understanding of:

1. Surface restructuring under reaction conditions
2. Adsorption and reaction mechanisms at the atomic scale
3. The nature of active sites and their evolution during reactions
4. The role of support interactions in catalyst performance

Future UHV studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts by:

1. Examining atomic-scale interactions between Pt and Ni on model surfaces
2. Investigating the formation and removal of different carbon species on bimetallic surfaces
3. Studying the adsorption and reaction mechanisms of CO, H2O, and CH4 on bimetallic surfaces
4. Correlating surface structure and composition with catalytic activity and selectivity
5. Exploring the effects of support materials on the properties of bimetallic particles

These studies could provide crucial correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering a more comprehensive understanding of these catalytic systems.

          基于铂的双金属催化剂，特别是NiPt组合，通过几种方式影响甲烷转化的机制和效率：

1. 抗积炭性：镍和铂的组合效应产生了比单金属系统更耐焦的催化剂。

2. 活性：双金属NiPt/沸石催化剂在甲烷转化中表现出比单金属Pt/沸石催化剂更低的活性。

3. 碳形成：与单金属催化剂相比，NiPt双金属催化剂产生更多的石墨状碳和更少的丝状碳。分散在BEA沸石上的Pt产生较低的碳沉积，这些积炭易被CO2去除。

4. 金属分散：铂的存在通过引起镍颗粒的重新分散，帮助将镍暴露给反应物，从而增强催化活性。

5. 反应速率：在NiPt双金属系统中，甲烷分解的速率比在单金属镍系统上慢，这归因于双金属样品上形成的碳物种具有更高的活性。

6. 机理洞察：甲烷干重整过程中的碳形成涉及几个步骤，包括甲烷裂解、碳通过金属颗粒扩散和碳纤维生长。

虽然这些反应器研究提供了宝贵的见解，但对基于Pt的双金属表面进行的超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供更详细的理解：

1. 反应条件下的表面重构
2. 原子尺度的吸附和反应机理
3. 活性位点的性质及其在反应过程中的演变
4. 载体相互作用在催化剂性能中的作用

未来的UHV研究可以通过以下方式帮助弥合模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距：

1. 研究模型表面上Pt和Ni之间的原子尺度相互作用
2. 调查双金属表面上不同碳物种的形成和去除过程
3. 研究CO、H2O和CH4在双金属表面上的吸附和反应机理
4. 将表面结构和成分与催化活性和选择性相关联
5. 探索载体材料对双金属颗粒性质的影响

这些研究可以提供模型表面和负载催化剂之间的关键相关性，为这些催化系统提供更全面的理解。
