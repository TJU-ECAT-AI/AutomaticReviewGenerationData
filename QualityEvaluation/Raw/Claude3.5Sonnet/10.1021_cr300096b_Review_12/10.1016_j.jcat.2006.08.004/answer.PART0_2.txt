[1] "The FTIR results indicate that the adsorption of CO was substantially weaker on bimetallic samples than on the corresponding monometallic ones."

[2] "Our results indicate that regardless of the pretreatment conditions, the CO adsorbed on the Pt sites of the PtRu/SiO2 samples (band at approximately 2070 cm1) is weakly bound to the surface."

[3] "These results demonstrate that Pt/SiO2 has a fairly narrow temperature window of operation for CO elimination under PROX conditions, consistent with previous literature reports"

[4] "When the bimetallic PtRu/SiO2 catalyst was directly reduced in H2 at 300C, its catalytic behavior was similar to that of monometallic Ru/SiO2 pretreated under similar conditions."

[5] "Only a very small fraction of Ru sites was present on the surface of PtRu samples treated in O2/H2, and hence, catalytic behavior similar to that of Pt would be expected. However, the activity of such samples is substantially improved over that of Pt, most probably due to the lower strength of adsorption of CO on Pt, which can be attributed to the PtRu interactions."

The bimetallic PtRu catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in several ways:

1. They weaken CO adsorption compared to monometallic catalysts, which can enhance CO oxidation activity by freeing up active sites.

2. The pretreatment conditions affect the surface composition and catalytic behavior. H2 reduction leads to behavior similar to monometallic Ru, while O2/H2 treatment results in Pt-enriched surfaces with improved activity over monometallic Pt.

3. PtRu interactions appear to lower CO adsorption strength on Pt, improving its catalytic activity for CO oxidation.

4. Pt/SiO2 alone has a narrow temperature window for CO elimination, but PtRu bimetallic catalysts can potentially widen this range.

The literature does not provide information on water gas shift reaction or methane conversions for these catalysts. 

Future UHV studies could provide insights by:

1. Directly observing CO adsorption strengths on model PtRu surfaces with varying compositions.

2. Investigating the effect of different pretreatments on surface segregation and reactivity.

3. Correlating surface structure and composition with catalytic activity for CO oxidation.

4. Examining the influence of PtRu interactions on O2 activation and reaction mechanisms.

These UHV studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing fundamental understanding of the bimetallic effects observed in reactor studies.

PtRu双金属催化剂以几种方式影响CO氧化机理和效率：

1. 与单金属催化剂相比，它们减弱了CO的吸附，这可以通过释放活性位点来增强CO氧化活性。

2. 预处理条件影响表面组成和催化行为。H2还原导致行为类似于单金属Ru，而O2/H2处理结果是富Pt表面，其活性优于单金属Pt。

3. PtRu相互作用似乎降低了Pt上CO的吸附强度，提高了其CO氧化的催化活性。

4. 单独的Pt/SiO2具有狭窄的CO消除温度窗口，但PtRu双金属催化剂可能会扩大这个范围。

文献没有提供这些催化剂的水气变换反应或甲烷转化的信息。

未来的UHV研究可以通过以下方式提供洞见：

1. 直接观察不同组成的模型PtRu表面上的CO吸附强度。

2. 研究不同预处理对表面偏析和反应性的影响。

3. 将表面结构和组成与CO氧化的催化活性相关联。

4. 检查PtRu相互作用对O2活化和反应机理的影响。

这些UHV研究可以帮助桥接模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距，为反应器研究中观察到的双金属效应提供基本理解。
