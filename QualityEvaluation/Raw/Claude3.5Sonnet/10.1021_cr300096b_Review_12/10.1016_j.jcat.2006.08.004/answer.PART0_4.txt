[1] "The high activity and selectivity of these monometallic catalysts in PROX is often related to the saturation of metal surfaces by CO, which prevents H2 adsorption and oxidation"

[2] "When the bimetallic PtRu/SiO2 catalyst was directly reduced in H2 at 300C, its catalytic behavior was similar to that of monometallic Ru/SiO2 pretreated under similar conditions."

[3] "Given the relatively small fraction of exposed Ru sites, we should also consider that the bimetallic interaction between Pt and Ru may have substantially enhanced the activity of Pt for PROX. Such an enhancement can be attributed to the lower strength of CO adsorption, as indicated by the FTIR measurements."

[4] "The lower strength of CO adsorption in the case of the PtRu sample could promote the oxidation of CO on Pt."

This study provides insights into how bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies:

1. The bimetallic interaction between Pt and Ru enhances the activity of Pt for preferential oxidation of CO (PROX). This is attributed to weaker CO adsorption on the bimetallic surface compared to monometallic Pt.

2. Weaker CO adsorption on the PtRu surface promotes CO oxidation on Pt sites by allowing more sites to be available for O2 adsorption and reaction.

3. The catalytic behavior depends on the pretreatment conditions. Direct H2 reduction results in behavior similar to monometallic Ru, while O2/H2 treatment leads to Pt surface enrichment and improved activity over monometallic Pt.

4. The study does not directly address water gas shift or methane conversion reactions.

5. While this reactor study provides valuable information on real catalyst systems, UHV studies on model PtRu surfaces could help elucidate the atomic-scale mechanisms behind the observed effects, such as the nature of active sites and how bimetallic interactions modify adsorption energies and reaction barriers. However, preparing well-defined bimetallic surfaces in UHV and bridging the materials gap remain challenges.

这项研究为双金属Pt-Ru催化剂如何影响CO氧化机理和效率提供了见解：

1. Pt和Ru之间的双金属相互作用增强了Pt对CO优先氧化(PROX)的活性。这归因于双金属表面上CO吸附强度较单金属Pt弱。

2. PtRu表面上较弱的CO吸附促进了Pt位点上的CO氧化，因为这允许更多位点可用于O2吸附和反应。

3. 催化行为取决于预处理条件。直接H2还原导致的行为类似于单金属Ru，而O2/H2处理导致Pt表面富集并提高了活性，优于单金属Pt。

4. 该研究没有直接涉及水煤气变换或甲烷转化反应。

5. 虽然这项反应器研究为实际催化剂系统提供了宝贵信息，但对模型PtRu表面的UHV研究可以帮助阐明观察到的效应背后的原子尺度机制，如活性位点的性质以及双金属相互作用如何修改吸附能和反应势垒。然而，在UHV中制备良好定义的双金属表面以及弥合材料差距仍然是挑战。
