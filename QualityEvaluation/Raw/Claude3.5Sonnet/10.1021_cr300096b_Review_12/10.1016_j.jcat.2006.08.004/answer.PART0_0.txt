[1] "When the bimetallic PtRu/SiO2 catalyst was directly reduced in H2 at 300C, its catalytic behavior was similar to that of monometallic Ru/SiO2 pretreated under similar conditions."

[2] "In contrast, when the same bimetallic catalyst underwent O2/H2 treatment at 300C, a delay of approximately 30C was observed in the CO light-off temperature."

[3] "Such a delay, signifying decreased CO oxidation activity, can be related to a decreased fraction of Ru sites available on the surface of this sample, because the FTIR data suggest that the surface of the metal nanoparticles formed after such treatment is enriched with Pt."

[4] "Given the relatively small fraction of exposed Ru sites, we should also consider that the bimetallic interaction between Pt and Ru may have substantially enhanced the activity of Pt for PROX."

[5] "Such an enhancement can be attributed to the lower strength of CO adsorption, as indicated by the FTIR measurements."

Bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in several ways:

1. The presence of Ru can modify Pt's catalytic behavior. When directly reduced in H2, the PtRu catalyst behaves similarly to monometallic Ru.

2. Pretreatment conditions affect catalyst performance. O2/H2 treatment leads to a delay in CO light-off temperature compared to H2-only treatment.

3. Surface composition impacts activity. O2/H2 treatment enriches the surface with Pt, reducing available Ru sites and decreasing CO oxidation activity.

4. Bimetallic interactions can enhance Pt activity for preferential oxidation of CO (PROX), even with fewer exposed Ru sites.

5. The enhancement is likely due to weaker CO adsorption on the bimetallic surface, as shown by FTIR measurements.

The literature does not provide information on water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. It also does not discuss potential insights from future UHV studies or correlations with model surfaces. To fully address these aspects, additional research would be needed.

Pt-Ru双金属催化剂以几种方式影响CO氧化机理和效率：

1. Ru的存在可以改变Pt的催化行为。当直接在H2中还原时，PtRu催化剂的行为与单金属Ru相似。

2. 预处理条件会影响催化剂性能。与仅H2处理相比，O2/H2处理导致CO起燃温度延迟。

3. 表面组成影响活性。O2/H2处理使表面富集Pt，减少可用的Ru位点，降低CO氧化活性。

4. 双金属相互作用可以增强Pt对CO优先氧化（PROX）的活性，即使暴露的Ru位点较少。

5. 根据FTIR测量结果，这种增强可能是由于CO在双金属表面上的吸附较弱。

文献没有提供关于水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化的信息。它也没有讨论未来UHV研究的潜在见解或与模型表面的相关性。要全面解决这些方面，需要进行额外的研究。
