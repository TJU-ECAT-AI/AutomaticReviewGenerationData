[1] "The activity of such samples is substantially improved over that of Pt, most probably due to the lower strength of adsorption of CO on Pt, which can be attributed to the PtRu interactions."

[2] "Strong interaction of CO with noble metals leads to an operating surface predominantly saturated with CO, even in the presence of H2 or O2. Hence, the onset of CO oxidation is controlled by the surface coverage of CO, which limits the number of vacant sites for O2 adsorption and dissociation."

[3] "Complete conversion of CO was never achieved with the PtRu/SiO2 sample that underwent O2/H2 treatment at 300C. As shown in Fig. 4, the CO conversion decreased immediately after reaching its maximum value of approximately 95% at 140C. Once again, this may be due to the decrease strength of CO adsorption, at elevated temperatures."

The literature provides insights into how Pt-Ru bimetallic catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies:

1. PtRu bimetallic catalysts show improved activity for CO oxidation compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. This is attributed to weaker CO adsorption on the bimetallic surface due to Pt-Ru interactions.

2. In CO oxidation, the reaction onset is controlled by CO surface coverage. Strong CO adsorption on noble metals like Pt limits available sites for O2 adsorption and dissociation. The weaker CO adsorption on PtRu bimetallic catalysts helps overcome this limitation.

3. However, the bimetallic catalyst showed incomplete CO conversion, with conversion decreasing after reaching a maximum around 140°C. This suggests that weaker CO adsorption may allow increased H2 oxidation at higher temperatures.

The literature does not directly address water gas shift or methane conversion reactions. It also does not discuss potential insights from UHV studies or current limitations in studying Pt-based bimetallic surfaces under UHV conditions. Future UHV studies could potentially provide more detailed understanding of adsorption energies, surface compositions, and reaction mechanisms on well-defined bimetallic surfaces to complement these reactor studies on supported catalysts.

该文献提供了关于Pt-Ru双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化机理和效率的见解：

1. PtRu双金属催化剂对CO氧化的活性比单金属Pt催化剂有所提高。这归因于由于Pt-Ru相互作用导致的双金属表面上CO吸附强度较弱。

2. 在CO氧化中，反应起始由CO表面覆盖度控制。CO在Pt等贵金属上的强吸附限制了O2吸附和解离的可用位点。PtRu双金属催化剂上较弱的CO吸附有助于克服这一限制。

3. 然而，双金属催化剂显示出不完全的CO转化，转化率在140°C左右达到最大值后开始下降。这表明较弱的CO吸附可能允许在较高温度下增加H2氧化。

该文献没有直接讨论水煤气变换或甲烷转化反应。它也没有讨论超高真空(UHV)研究的潜在见解或在UHV条件下研究基于Pt的双金属表面的当前限制。未来的UHV研究可能会对定义明确的双金属表面的吸附能、表面组成和反应机理提供更详细的理解，从而补充这些对负载型催化剂的反应器研究。
