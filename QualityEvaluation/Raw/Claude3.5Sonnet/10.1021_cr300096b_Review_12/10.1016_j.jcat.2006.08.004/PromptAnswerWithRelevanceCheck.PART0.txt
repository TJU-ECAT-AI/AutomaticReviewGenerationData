[1] "When the bimetallic PtRu/SiO2 catalyst was directly reduced in H2 at 300C, its catalytic behavior was similar to that of monometallic Ru/SiO2 pretreated under similar conditions."

[2] "In contrast, when the same bimetallic catalyst underwent O2/H2 treatment at 300C, a delay of approximately 30C was observed in the CO light-off temperature."

[3] "Such a delay, signifying decreased CO oxidation activity, can be related to a decreased fraction of Ru sites available on the surface of this sample, because the FTIR data suggest that the surface of the metal nanoparticles formed after such treatment is enriched with Pt."

[4] "Given the relatively small fraction of exposed Ru sites, we should also consider that the bimetallic interaction between Pt and Ru may have substantially enhanced the activity of Pt for PROX."

[5] "Such an enhancement can be attributed to the lower strength of CO adsorption, as indicated by the FTIR measurements."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in several ways:

1. The presence of Ru can modify Pt's catalytic behavior. When directly reduced in H2, the PtRu catalyst behaves similarly to monometallic Ru.

2. Pretreatment conditions affect catalyst performance. O2/H2 treatment leads to a delay in CO light-off temperature compared to H2-only treatment.

3. Surface composition impacts activity. O2/H2 treatment enriches the surface with Pt, reducing available Ru sites and decreasing CO oxidation activity.

4. Bimetallic interactions can enhance Pt activity for preferential oxidation of CO (PROX), even with fewer exposed Ru sites.

5. The enhancement is likely due to weaker CO adsorption on the bimetallic surface, as shown by FTIR measurements.

The literature does not provide information on water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. It also does not discuss potential insights from future UHV studies or correlations with model surfaces. To fully address these aspects, additional research would be needed.

Pt-Ru双金属催化剂以几种方式影响CO氧化机理和效率：

1. Ru的存在可以改变Pt的催化行为。当直接在H2中还原时，PtRu催化剂的行为与单金属Ru相似。

2. 预处理条件会影响催化剂性能。与仅H2处理相比，O2/H2处理导致CO起燃温度延迟。

3. 表面组成影响活性。O2/H2处理使表面富集Pt，减少可用的Ru位点，降低CO氧化活性。

4. 双金属相互作用可以增强Pt对CO优先氧化（PROX）的活性，即使暴露的Ru位点较少。

5. 根据FTIR测量结果，这种增强可能是由于CO在双金属表面上的吸附较弱。

文献没有提供关于水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化的信息。它也没有讨论未来UHV研究的潜在见解或与模型表面的相关性。要全面解决这些方面，需要进行额外的研究。

[1] "The activity of such samples is substantially improved over that of Pt, most probably due to the lower strength of adsorption of CO on Pt, which can be attributed to the PtRu interactions."

[2] "Strong interaction of CO with noble metals leads to an operating surface predominantly saturated with CO, even in the presence of H2 or O2. Hence, the onset of CO oxidation is controlled by the surface coverage of CO, which limits the number of vacant sites for O2 adsorption and dissociation."

[3] "Complete conversion of CO was never achieved with the PtRu/SiO2 sample that underwent O2/H2 treatment at 300C. As shown in Fig. 4, the CO conversion decreased immediately after reaching its maximum value of approximately 95% at 140C. Once again, this may be due to the decrease strength of CO adsorption, at elevated temperatures."

The literature provides insights into how Pt-Ru bimetallic catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies:

1. PtRu bimetallic catalysts show improved activity for CO oxidation compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. This is attributed to weaker CO adsorption on the bimetallic surface due to Pt-Ru interactions.

2. In CO oxidation, the reaction onset is controlled by CO surface coverage. Strong CO adsorption on noble metals like Pt limits available sites for O2 adsorption and dissociation. The weaker CO adsorption on PtRu bimetallic catalysts helps overcome this limitation.

3. However, the bimetallic catalyst showed incomplete CO conversion, with conversion decreasing after reaching a maximum around 140°C. This suggests that weaker CO adsorption may allow increased H2 oxidation at higher temperatures.

The literature does not directly address water gas shift or methane conversion reactions. It also does not discuss potential insights from UHV studies or current limitations in studying Pt-based bimetallic surfaces under UHV conditions. Future UHV studies could potentially provide more detailed understanding of adsorption energies, surface compositions, and reaction mechanisms on well-defined bimetallic surfaces to complement these reactor studies on supported catalysts.

该文献提供了关于Pt-Ru双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化机理和效率的见解：

1. PtRu双金属催化剂对CO氧化的活性比单金属Pt催化剂有所提高。这归因于由于Pt-Ru相互作用导致的双金属表面上CO吸附强度较弱。

2. 在CO氧化中，反应起始由CO表面覆盖度控制。CO在Pt等贵金属上的强吸附限制了O2吸附和解离的可用位点。PtRu双金属催化剂上较弱的CO吸附有助于克服这一限制。

3. 然而，双金属催化剂显示出不完全的CO转化，转化率在140°C左右达到最大值后开始下降。这表明较弱的CO吸附可能允许在较高温度下增加H2氧化。

该文献没有直接讨论水煤气变换或甲烷转化反应。它也没有讨论超高真空(UHV)研究的潜在见解或在UHV条件下研究基于Pt的双金属表面的当前限制。未来的UHV研究可能会对定义明确的双金属表面的吸附能、表面组成和反应机理提供更详细的理解，从而补充这些对负载型催化剂的反应器研究。

[1] "The FTIR results indicate that the adsorption of CO was substantially weaker on bimetallic samples than on the corresponding monometallic ones."

[2] "Our results indicate that regardless of the pretreatment conditions, the CO adsorbed on the Pt sites of the PtRu/SiO2 samples (band at approximately 2070 cm1) is weakly bound to the surface."

[3] "These results demonstrate that Pt/SiO2 has a fairly narrow temperature window of operation for CO elimination under PROX conditions, consistent with previous literature reports"

[4] "When the bimetallic PtRu/SiO2 catalyst was directly reduced in H2 at 300C, its catalytic behavior was similar to that of monometallic Ru/SiO2 pretreated under similar conditions."

[5] "Only a very small fraction of Ru sites was present on the surface of PtRu samples treated in O2/H2, and hence, catalytic behavior similar to that of Pt would be expected. However, the activity of such samples is substantially improved over that of Pt, most probably due to the lower strength of adsorption of CO on Pt, which can be attributed to the PtRu interactions."

The bimetallic PtRu catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in several ways:

1. They weaken CO adsorption compared to monometallic catalysts, which can enhance CO oxidation activity by freeing up active sites.

2. The pretreatment conditions affect the surface composition and catalytic behavior. H2 reduction leads to behavior similar to monometallic Ru, while O2/H2 treatment results in Pt-enriched surfaces with improved activity over monometallic Pt.

3. PtRu interactions appear to lower CO adsorption strength on Pt, improving its catalytic activity for CO oxidation.

4. Pt/SiO2 alone has a narrow temperature window for CO elimination, but PtRu bimetallic catalysts can potentially widen this range.

The literature does not provide information on water gas shift reaction or methane conversions for these catalysts. 

Future UHV studies could provide insights by:

1. Directly observing CO adsorption strengths on model PtRu surfaces with varying compositions.

2. Investigating the effect of different pretreatments on surface segregation and reactivity.

3. Correlating surface structure and composition with catalytic activity for CO oxidation.

4. Examining the influence of PtRu interactions on O2 activation and reaction mechanisms.

These UHV studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing fundamental understanding of the bimetallic effects observed in reactor studies.

PtRu双金属催化剂以几种方式影响CO氧化机理和效率：

1. 与单金属催化剂相比，它们减弱了CO的吸附，这可以通过释放活性位点来增强CO氧化活性。

2. 预处理条件影响表面组成和催化行为。H2还原导致行为类似于单金属Ru，而O2/H2处理结果是富Pt表面，其活性优于单金属Pt。

3. PtRu相互作用似乎降低了Pt上CO的吸附强度，提高了其CO氧化的催化活性。

4. 单独的Pt/SiO2具有狭窄的CO消除温度窗口，但PtRu双金属催化剂可能会扩大这个范围。

文献没有提供这些催化剂的水气变换反应或甲烷转化的信息。

未来的UHV研究可以通过以下方式提供洞见：

1. 直接观察不同组成的模型PtRu表面上的CO吸附强度。

2. 研究不同预处理对表面偏析和反应性的影响。

3. 将表面结构和组成与CO氧化的催化活性相关联。

4. 检查PtRu相互作用对O2活化和反应机理的影响。

这些UHV研究可以帮助桥接模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距，为反应器研究中观察到的双金属效应提供基本理解。

[1] "The results indicate that the presence of Pt stabilizes Ru and prevents its sintering during exposure to oxidizing conditions. Furthermore, the strength of the CO adsorption on the bimetallic samples is lower than that on the monometallic counterparts, presumably due to the presence of bimetallic interactions between Pt and Ru."

[2] "Only a very small fraction of Ru sites was present on the surface of PtRu samples treated in O2/H2, and hence, catalytic behavior similar to that of Pt would be expected.

The bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in several ways:

1. Pt stabilizes Ru and prevents its sintering under oxidizing conditions, maintaining catalyst dispersion.

2. The bimetallic interaction between Pt and Ru weakens CO adsorption compared to monometallic catalysts. This allows for improved CO oxidation activity at lower temperatures.

3. Surface composition affects activity - O2/H2 treated PtRu samples with Pt-enriched surfaces show improved activity over pure Pt, likely due to weakened CO binding from Pt-Ru interactions.

4. However, the weakened CO adsorption also limits maximum CO conversion and narrows the effective temperature window, as CO desorbs more easily at higher temperatures.

The study does not directly address water-gas shift or methane conversion reactions. 

Regarding potential UHV studies, they could provide valuable insights by:

1. Allowing precise control over surface composition to correlate activity with Pt:Ru ratios.

2. Enabling detailed spectroscopic studies of CO adsorption energies and binding sites on well-defined bimetallic surfaces.

3. Permitting in-situ observation of surface segregation effects under reaction conditions.

4. Facilitating fundamental mechanistic studies of elementary reaction steps.

However, the current literature does not discuss UHV limitations for Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, so further insights on this aspect cannot be provided based solely on the given information.

Pt-Ru双金属催化剂通过以下几种方式影响CO氧化机理和效率：

1. Pt稳定Ru并防止其在氧化条件下烧结，从而保持催化剂的分散性。

2. Pt和Ru之间的双金属相互作用削弱了CO的吸附，相比单金属催化剂而言。这使得在较低温度下CO氧化活性得到改善。

3. 表面组成影响活性 - 经O2/H2处理的PtRu样品表面富Pt，显示出比纯Pt更好的活性，可能是由于Pt-Ru相互作用导致CO结合减弱。

4. 然而，减弱的CO吸附也限制了最大CO转化率，并缩小了有效温度窗口，因为CO在较高温度下更容易脱附。

该研究没有直接涉及水气变换或甲烷转化反应。

关于潜在的UHV研究，它们可以通过以下方式提供宝贵的见解：

1. 允许精确控制表面组成，以将活性与Pt:Ru比例相关联。

2. 能够对定义明确的双金属表面进行CO吸附能和结合位点的详细光谱研究。

3. 允许在反应条件下原位观察表面偏析效应。

4. 促进基本反应步骤的基础机理研究。

然而，当前文献并未讨论Pt基双金属表面的UHV限制，因此仅基于给定信息无法提供有关这方面的进一步见解。

This study provides insights into how bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies:

1. The bimetallic interaction between Pt and Ru enhances the activity of Pt for preferential oxidation of CO (PROX). This is attributed to weaker CO adsorption on the bimetallic surface compared to monometallic Pt.

2. Weaker CO adsorption on the PtRu surface promotes CO oxidation on Pt sites by allowing more sites to be available for O2 adsorption and reaction.

3. The catalytic behavior depends on the pretreatment conditions. Direct H2 reduction results in behavior similar to monometallic Ru, while O2/H2 treatment leads to Pt surface enrichment and improved activity over monometallic Pt.

4. The study does not directly address water gas shift or methane conversion reactions.

5. While this reactor study provides valuable information on real catalyst systems, UHV studies on model PtRu surfaces could help elucidate the atomic-scale mechanisms behind the observed effects, such as the nature of active sites and how bimetallic interactions modify adsorption energies and reaction barriers. However, preparing well-defined bimetallic surfaces in UHV and bridging the materials gap remain challenges.

2. PtRu表面上较弱的CO吸附促进了Pt位点上的CO氧化，因为这允许更多位点可用于O2吸附和反应。

3. 催化行为取决于预处理条件。直接H2还原导致的行为类似于单金属Ru，而O2/H2处理导致Pt表面富集并提高了活性，优于单金属Pt。

4. 该研究没有直接涉及水煤气变换或甲烷转化反应。

5. 虽然这项反应器研究为实际催化剂系统提供了宝贵信息，但对模型PtRu表面的UHV研究可以帮助阐明观察到的效应背后的原子尺度机制，如活性位点的性质以及双金属相互作用如何修改吸附能和反应势垒。然而，在UHV中制备良好定义的双金属表面以及弥合材料差距仍然是挑战。
