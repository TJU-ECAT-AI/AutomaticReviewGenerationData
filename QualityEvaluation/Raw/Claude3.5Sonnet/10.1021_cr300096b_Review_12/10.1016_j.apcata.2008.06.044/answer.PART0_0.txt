[1] "Our recent studies [21], [22] evidenced ruthenium as a good catalyst for CPO, though its stability needs to be improved and wide hysteresis cycles are observed while varying reaction temperature, apparently connected to the ease with which Ru is reduced and oxidized."

[2] "Conversely, Pt hardly undergoes redox reactions and it has some activity for CPO as well [23], [25]. In this work we present results of combining Pt and Ru on a bimetallic catalyst that showed good activity and selectivity towards CPO products and a much better stability than monometallic Ru."

[3] "Pt stabilizes Ru, limiting redox reactions during the heating and cooling cycles. The small residual hysteresis is likely caused by thermal effects and not by chemistry (reduction/oxidation reactions). The light-off temperature is also lower than for monometallic ruthenium, but the catalyst starts converting reactants following mainly total oxidation stoichiometry."

[4] "As temperature increases, CPO products clearly prevail and their ratio stabilizes at a value suitable for Fisher–Tropsch applications (H2/CO2 = 2). Even if not tested for many tens of hours, the catalyst did not show any marked aging effects, keeping its activity almost unchanged."

The bimetallic Pt-Ru catalyst studied in this paper shows several important influences on methane conversion mechanisms and efficiencies compared to monometallic catalysts:

1. Improved stability: The addition of Pt stabilizes Ru, limiting redox reactions during temperature cycles. This results in reduced hysteresis and better overall stability compared to monometallic Ru catalysts.

2. Lower light-off temperature: The bimetallic catalyst activates methane conversion at a lower temperature than monometallic Ru, though initially following total oxidation stoichiometry.

3. Reaction pathway: At lower temperatures, the catalyst favors total oxidation of methane. As temperature increases, partial oxidation products (CO and H2) become dominant, eventually reaching a ratio suitable for Fisher-Tropsch applications.

4. Reduced aging effects: The bimetallic catalyst shows minimal aging effects over the testing period, maintaining its activity.

5. Synergistic effects: The combination of Pt and Ru appears to combine the best features of each metal - Pt's ability to activate methane at lower temperatures and Ru's selectivity towards partial oxidation products.

While this study provides valuable insights into the behavior of supported Pt-Ru bimetallic catalysts for methane conversion, future UHV studies could potentially offer more detailed understanding of:

1. Surface reactions and intermediates at the atomic level
2. The exact nature of the interaction between Pt and Ru atoms on the surface
3. The role of support materials in the catalytic process
4. The impact of various pretreatments on catalyst performance

However, it's important to note that UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces have limitations in directly correlating to supported catalysts under reaction conditions. Bridging this "pressure gap" remains a challenge in catalysis research.

本文研究的双金属Pt-Ru催化剂在甲烷转化机理和效率方面相比单金属催化剂显示出几个重要影响：

1. 稳定性提高：Pt的添加稳定了Ru，限制了温度循环过程中的氧化还原反应。这导致滞后现象减少，整体稳定性比单金属Ru催化剂更好。

2. 更低的点火温度：双金属催化剂在比单金属Ru更低的温度下激活甲烷转化，尽管最初遵循完全氧化化学计量比。

3. 反应途径：在较低温度下，催化剂倾向于甲烷的完全氧化。随着温度升高，部分氧化产物（CO和H2）变得占主导地位，最终达到适合费-托合成的比例。

4. 老化效应减少：双金属催化剂在测试期间显示出最小的老化效应，保持其活性。

5. 协同效应：Pt和Ru的组合似乎结合了每种金属的最佳特性 - Pt在较低温度下激活甲烷的能力和Ru对部分氧化产物的选择性。

虽然这项研究为甲烷转化中负载型Pt-Ru双金属催化剂的行为提供了宝贵的见解，但未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会提供更详细的理解：

1. 原子水平的表面反应和中间体
2. 表面上Pt和Ru原子之间相互作用的确切性质
3. 载体材料在催化过程中的作用
4. 各种预处理对催化剂性能的影响

然而，重要的是要注意，Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究在直接与反应条件下的负载催化剂相关联方面存在局限性。弥合这种"压力差距"仍然是催化研究中的一个挑战。
