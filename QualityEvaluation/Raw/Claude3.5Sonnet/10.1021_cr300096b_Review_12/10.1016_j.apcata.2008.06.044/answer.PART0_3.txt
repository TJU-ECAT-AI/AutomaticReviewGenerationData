[1] "Our recent studies [21], [22] evidenced ruthenium as a good catalyst for CPO, though its stability needs to be improved and wide hysteresis cycles are observed while varying reaction temperature, apparently connected to the ease with which Ru is reduced and oxidized."

[2] "Conversely, Pt hardly undergoes redox reactions and it has some activity for CPO as well [23], [25]."

[3] "In this work we present results of combining Pt and Ru on a bimetallic catalyst that showed good activity and selectivity towards CPO products and a much better stability than monometallic Ru."

[4] "Summarizing, we can conclude that Pt improves the stability of the catalyst preventing or limiting the Ru redox behavior."

[5] "We developed a more efficient and stable catalyst for syngas production from methane. We combined the best features of Pt that activates methane at low temperature and those of Ru that is very selective towards CPO products."

The literature provides insights into how Pt-Ru bimetallic catalysts influence methane conversion mechanisms and efficiencies:

1. Pt improves catalyst stability by limiting Ru redox behavior, reducing hysteresis cycles observed in monometallic Ru catalysts.

2. The bimetallic catalyst combines Pt's ability to activate methane at low temperatures with Ru's high selectivity towards partial oxidation (CPO) products.

3. Pt triggers the reaction at lower temperatures compared to monometallic Ru catalysts, though initially favoring total oxidation of methane (TOM).

4. As temperature increases, CPO products prevail, with the H2/CO ratio stabilizing at 2, suitable for Fischer-Tropsch applications.

5. The bimetallic catalyst shows improved stability and efficiency for syngas production from methane compared to monometallic catalysts.

The literature does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions, nor does it discuss UHV studies. Future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could potentially provide atomic-level insights into:

1. The synergistic effects between Pt and Ru in methane activation and product selectivity.
2. The mechanisms behind Pt's stabilizing effect on Ru.
3. The transition from TOM to CPO as temperature increases.
4. The role of each metal in various reaction steps.

Such studies could help correlate reactor findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, bridging the gap between applied catalysis and fundamental surface science.

文献为Pt-Ru双金属催化剂如何影响甲烷转化机理和效率提供了洞见：

1. Pt通过限制Ru的氧化还原行为来改善催化剂稳定性，减少了单金属Ru催化剂中观察到的滞后循环。

2. 双金属催化剂结合了Pt在低温下活化甲烷的能力和Ru对部分氧化（CPO）产物的高选择性。

3. 与单金属Ru催化剂相比，Pt在较低温度下触发反应，尽管最初倾向于甲烷的完全氧化（TOM）。

4. 随着温度升高，CPO产物占主导地位，H2/CO比稳定在2，适合费-托合成应用。

5. 与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂显示出改进的稳定性和效率，用于从甲烷生产合成气。

文献没有直接涉及CO氧化或水气变换反应，也没有讨论UHV研究。未来对Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究可能会提供原子级别的洞见：

1. Pt和Ru在甲烷活化和产物选择性方面的协同效应。
2. Pt对Ru稳定作用的机理。
3. 随温度升高从TOM到CPO的转变。
4. 各金属在不同反应步骤中的作用。

这些研究可以帮助将反应器研究结果与模型表面和负载催化剂相关联，bridging应用催化与基础表面科学之间的差距。
