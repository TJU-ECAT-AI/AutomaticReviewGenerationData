[1] "The PtCu catalyst showed lower H2 yield in WGS compared to the Cu catalyst, but it exhibited higher H2 yield in OWGS, and extent of the enhancement by O2 addition (difference between OWGS and WGS) is similar to PdCu catalyst."

[2] "The combination of Pt and Cu lowers the reduction temperature of Cu giving a single peak at around 148 C. This suggests that Pt and Cu interact and each makes the other more reducible."

[3] "Fits of Pt(1)Cu(5)/CeO2 showed completely different environment around Pt from Pt(1)/CeO2, i.e., Pt has 6 Cu neighbors at 2.54 Å and 3 Pt neighbors at 2.75 Å. The higher Pt coordination to Cu than to Pt indicates high dispersion of Pt in Cu, probably forming PtCu alloy."

[4] "It was proposed that the O2 addition partially oxidizes chemisorbed CO leading to vacant sites for H2O adsorption and reaction."

Bimetallic Pt-Cu catalysts show complex influences on CO oxidation, water gas shift (WGS), and oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) reactions:

1. In WGS, PtCu catalysts exhibit lower H2 yield compared to monometallic Cu catalysts. However, in OWGS, PtCu catalysts show higher H2 yield and significant enhancement with O2 addition.

2. The interaction between Pt and Cu in bimetallic catalysts lowers the reduction temperature of Cu, suggesting increased reducibility of both metals.

3. EXAFS studies reveal that in PtCu/CeO2 catalysts, Pt is highly dispersed in Cu, likely forming a PtCu alloy. This structural arrangement affects the catalytic properties.

4. O2 addition in OWGS is proposed to partially oxidize chemisorbed CO, creating vacant sites for H2O adsorption and reaction. This mechanism explains the enhanced performance of bimetallic catalysts in OWGS.

The literature does not provide information on methane conversions or UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into:

1. The surface structure and composition of PtCu alloys under reaction conditions.
2. The adsorption and reaction mechanisms of CO, H2O, and O2 on PtCu surfaces.
3. The role of support interactions in catalytic activity, which is difficult to study in reactor conditions.
4. The nature of active sites and how they differ between bimetallic and monometallic surfaces.

These UHV studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the catalytic mechanisms observed in reactor studies.

双金属Pt-Cu催化剂对CO氧化、水煤气变换（WGS）和氧增强水煤气变换（OWGS）反应显示出复杂的影响：

1. 在WGS反应中，PtCu催化剂比单金属Cu催化剂表现出较低的H2产率。然而，在OWGS反应中，PtCu催化剂显示出更高的H2产率，并且在添加O2后表现出显著的增强效果。

2. 双金属催化剂中Pt和Cu的相互作用降低了Cu的还原温度，表明两种金属的还原性都有所增加。

3. EXAFS研究表明，在PtCu/CeO2催化剂中，Pt高度分散在Cu中，很可能形成PtCu合金。这种结构安排影响了催化性能。

4. 在OWGS中添加O2据推测可以部分氧化化学吸附的CO，从而创造出H2O吸附和反应的空位。这一机制解释了双金属催化剂在OWGS中的性能增强。

文献中没有提供关于甲烷转化或Pt基双金属表面的超高真空（UHV）研究的信息。未来的UHV研究可能会提供以下方面的见解：

1. 反应条件下PtCu合金的表面结构和成分。
2. CO、H2O和O2在PtCu表面上的吸附和反应机理。
3. 支持物相互作用在催化活性中的作用，这在反应器条件下难以研究。
4. 活性位点的性质，以及它们在双金属和单金属表面之间的差异。

这些UHV研究可以帮助弥合模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距，为反应器研究中观察到的催化机理提供更全面的理解。
