[1] "Ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, such as PtCu and PdCu, exhibited higher OWGS activity than monometallic catalysts while the superiority of bimetallic catalysts was not as pronounced in WGS."

[2] "The TPR and OSC measurements revealed the existence of strong interaction between Pt and Cu or between Pd and Cu, which makes the bimetallic catalyst more resistant toward oxidation (less pyrophoric)."

[3] "These characteristics were found originated from a unique structure of bimetallic particles, highly dispersed Pt in Cu or Pd in Cu. EXAFS spectra indicated that Cu forms alloys with Pt and with Pd."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones like PtCu, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation and water gas shift reaction by exhibiting higher activity in oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) compared to monometallic catalysts. This is due to strong interactions between Pt and Cu, which creates a unique structure of highly dispersed Pt in Cu, forming alloys. These interactions make the bimetallic catalysts more resistant to oxidation and less pyrophoric.

The presence of Cu in bimetallic catalysts, such as PdCu/CeO2, facilitates CO2 desorption and decreases the amount of surface carbonate on CeO2. This suggests that the bimetallic structure affects the surface chemistry and reaction mechanisms.

Future UHV studies could provide insights into the atomic-level structure and electronic properties of these bimetallic surfaces, which could help correlate the reactor study findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. Such studies could investigate the nature of the Pt-Cu alloy formation, the distribution of Pt in Cu, and how these factors influence adsorption and desorption of reactants and products. Additionally, UHV studies could examine the oxidation resistance of these bimetallic surfaces at an atomic level, providing a deeper understanding of their reduced pyrophoricity.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may include difficulties in creating well-defined alloy surfaces that accurately represent the highly dispersed Pt in Cu structure observed in supported catalysts. Overcoming these challenges could provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the enhanced performance of these bimetallic catalysts in OWGS and related reactions.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂（如PtCu），通过在氧气增强的水煤气变换反应（OWGS）中表现出比单金属催化剂更高的活性，影响了CO氧化和水煤气变换反应的机理和效率。这是由于Pt和Cu之间的强相互作用，创造了一种独特的结构，即Cu中高度分散的Pt，形成合金。这些相互作用使双金属催化剂对氧化更具抗性，且更不易自燃。

在双金属催化剂中Cu的存在，如PdCu/CeO2，促进了CO2的脱附，并减少了CeO2表面碳酸盐的数量。这表明双金属结构影响了表面化学和反应机理。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可以提供这些双金属表面原子级结构和电子性质的见解，这有助于将反应器研究结果与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联。这些研究可以探究Pt-Cu合金形成的本质，Pt在Cu中的分布，以及这些因素如何影响反应物和产物的吸附和脱附。此外，UHV研究可以在原子水平上检查这些双金属表面的抗氧化性，从而深入理解其降低的自燃性。

然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究中的限制可能包括难以创建能准确代表负载型催化剂中观察到的Cu中高度分散Pt结构的明确定义的合金表面。克服这些挑战可以为理解这些双金属催化剂在OWGS和相关反应中性能增强的基本机理提供宝贵的见解。
