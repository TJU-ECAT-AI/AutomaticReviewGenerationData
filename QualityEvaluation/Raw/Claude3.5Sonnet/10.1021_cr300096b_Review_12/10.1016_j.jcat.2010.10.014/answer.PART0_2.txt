[1] "Ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, such as PtCu and PdCu, exhibited higher OWGS activity than monometallic catalysts while the superiority of bimetallic catalysts was not as pronounced in WGS."

[2] "It was proposed that the O2 addition partially oxidizes chemisorbed CO leading to vacant sites for H2O adsorption and reaction."

[3] "The TPR and OSC measurements revealed the existence of strong interaction between Pt and Cu or between Pd and Cu, which makes the bimetallic catalyst more resistant toward oxidation (less pyrophoric)."

[4] "EXAFS spectra indicated that Cu forms alloys with Pt and with Pd."

[5] "The presence of Cu in PdCu/CeO2 facilitates CO2 desorption, decreasing the amount of surface carbonate on CeO2."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation and water gas shift reaction in several ways:

1. They exhibit higher activity in oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) reactions compared to monometallic catalysts.

2. The addition of O2 partially oxidizes chemisorbed CO, creating vacant sites for H2O adsorption and reaction, thus enhancing the overall reaction efficiency.

3. Strong interactions between Pt and Cu or Pd and Cu make the bimetallic catalysts more resistant to oxidation and less pyrophoric.

4. The formation of alloys between Cu and Pt or Pd alters the catalyst structure and properties.

5. In PdCu/CeO2 catalysts, the presence of Cu facilitates CO2 desorption, reducing surface carbonate formation on CeO2.

The literature does not provide information on methane conversions or UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into:

1. The atomic-scale structure and composition of bimetallic surfaces.
2. The adsorption and reaction mechanisms of CO, H2O, and O2 on these surfaces.
3. The electronic properties of bimetallic catalysts and their influence on reactivity.
4. The role of support materials (like CeO2) in modifying catalyst properties.

These UHV studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the catalytic processes observed in reactor studies.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，通过以下几种方式影响CO氧化和水煤气变换反应的机理和效率：

1. 它们在氧气强化水煤气变换（OWGS）反应中表现出比单金属催化剂更高的活性。

2. 添加O2部分氧化化学吸附的CO，为H2O吸附和反应创造空位，从而提高整体反应效率。

3. Pt与Cu或Pd与Cu之间的强相互作用使双金属催化剂更耐氧化和不易自燃。

4. Cu与Pt或Pd形成合金改变了催化剂的结构和性能。

5. 在PdCu/CeO2催化剂中，Cu的存在促进了CO2的脱附，减少了CeO2表面碳酸盐的形成。

文献未提供关于甲烷转化或Pt基双金属表面的超高真空（UHV）研究信息。未来的UHV研究可能会提供以下方面的见解：

1. 双金属表面的原子尺度结构和成分。
2. CO、H2O和O2在这些表面上的吸附和反应机理。
3. 双金属催化剂的电子性质及其对反应活性的影响。
4. 载体材料（如CeO2）在改变催化剂性能中的作用。

这些UHV研究可以帮助弥合模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距，为反应器研究中观察到的催化过程提供更全面的理解。
