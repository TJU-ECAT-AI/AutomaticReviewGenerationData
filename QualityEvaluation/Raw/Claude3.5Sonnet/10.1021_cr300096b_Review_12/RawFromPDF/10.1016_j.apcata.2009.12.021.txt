Methane partial oxidation over Pt–Ru catalyst: An investigation on the mechanism
Abstract
The mechanism of the partial oxidation of methane has been investigated over a bimetallic Pt–Ru catalyst. Dedicated experiments aimed to separate and quantify the relative contribution of single reactions included in the so-called “combustion and reforming” mechanism using the same catalyst. The catalyst is 0.5% Ru and 0.5% Pt (w/w) supported on mixture of alumina, ceria and zirconia (75/4.4/20.6%, w/w), washcoated on a ceramic monolith. Steam reforming, dry reforming, direct and reverse water-gas shift reactions were investigated. The temperature range investigated is 300 < T < 800 °C, while the space velocity range is 25,000 < GHSV < 100,000 h−1. Conditions at which single side reactions are expected to occur during the partial oxidation process, were approximated by tuning the reactant composition. The experimental results are also compared with thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. The CO and H2 yields of partial oxidation have been quantitatively connected with steam and dry reforming, while the persistent water-gas shift reaction always rearranges the products and intermediates.

The relative contribution of total combustion, dry and steam reforming, and water-gas shift reactions to the methane partial oxidation has been studied by carrying out each one alone on the same bimetallic Pt–Ru catalyst. The CO and H2 yield of partial oxidation has been quantitatively related with steam and dry reforming, while the persistent water-gas shift reaction always rearranges the products and intermediates.

1. Introduction
During the last decades the research on catalytic partial oxidation of methane (CPO) has received a strong impulse both for economic and environmental reasons. The reaction represents a viable process for producing synthesis gas, useful in Fisher–Tropsch processes for synthetic fuels production.
CPO offers advantages over steam reforming (currently practiced for syngas production)
[1]
and understanding the mechanism followed by the reaction is very important both for technical reasons and also for developing new catalysts with better performance.
There is a large number of studies available in the literature, but the mechanism leading to the formation of CO and H2 is not fully clarified, yet. There are two different reaction mechanisms proposed: one is the direct pathway in which CH4 and O2 adsorb on the catalyst and then react to CO and H2; the second one is the so-called “combustion and reforming mechanism” (CRM). According to this latter, CH4 and O2 first form CO2 and water following a complete combustion pathway; afterwards, steam and dry reforming produce CO and H2. The reactions involved in both mechanisms are summarized below:
Direct partial oxidation:
(1)
CH4 + ½O2 = CO + 2 H2 ΔH = −36 kJ/mol
Combustion and reforming mechanism:
•
total oxidation (combustion):
(2)
CH4 + 2O2 = CO2 + 2H2O ΔH = −801 kJ/mol
•
steam reforming:
(3)
CH4 + H2O = CO + 3H2 ΔH = 206 kJ/mol
•
dry reforming:
(4)
CH4 + CO2 = 2CO + 2H2 ΔH = 247 kJ/mol
•
water-gas shift:
(5)
CO + H2O = CO2 + H2 ΔH = −41 kJ/mol
Other reactions reported are

:
(6)
CH4 + O2 = CO + 2H2O
(7)
CH4 + O2 = CO2 + 2H2
and the formation of solid carbon might be involved, as well:

CH4 = C + 2H2
Hickman and Schmidt supported the direct pathway for Rh catalysts
[3]
and for Pt and Pt–Rh catalysts
[4]
, but recently Schmidt and co-workers measured clear evidences of the sequence total oxidation-reforming reactions for Rh
[5]
,
[6]
. Tavazzi et al.
[7]
proposed the occurrence of the indirect mechanism on Rh/α-Al2O3 investigating the kinetic scheme of CPO also with dedicated tests for reforming reactions. Elmasides and Verykios propose the direct mechanism for Ru on TiO2
[8]
, while Weng et al. propose the indirect combustion and reforming pathway for Ru on alumina and on silica
[9]
. Guerrero-Ruiz et al. found evidences of the indirect mechanism for Ru supported on alumina and silica
[2]
. For Ir, Pt and Ni-based catalyst supported on TiO2, Nakagawa et al. proposed the indirect pathway
[10]
. A rather complex frame emerges from the literature, due to the different factors affecting the catalyst behaviour, such as the metal used, the support, the preparation technique and so on. It is also to be considered that among those works that (mainly for Rh) provide evidences of the direct mechanism, the residence time plays a crucial role. Hickman and Schmidt
[4]
, in example, that worked with very short contact times (7 ms) state that “Because of the short residence times used in these experiments, the shift and reforming reactions do not play a significant role in determining the reactor selectivities and conversions”. Among works that support the indirect mechanism, the relative importance of each reaction occurring after the combustion stage is not clear: steam reforming, dry reforming and water-gas shift reactions are identified, but since products are similar, their relative importance for the global process is not clear. Discerning the mechanism of the reaction is relevant also because of the widely different thermal effects of the reactions involved, as summarized above, which dramatically affect both the design and management of industrial reactors. Ru is one of the most active and selective metals for CPO, but it shows some stability issues
[11]
. Pt is less selective, but it turned out to be very useful in stabilizing ruthenium in the CPO reaction
[12]
: in this work we presented the results of a bimetallic catalyst, which showed rather good activity and selectivity towards CO and H2 and also good stability. To complete the work, the next step was to identify the reactions occurring and to quantify the contribution of each to the final product composition. This is what is illustrated in the present paper, where we carried out dedicated tests for each single reaction that was assumed to be involved in the global mechanism.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Materials and methods
All tests have been carried out in the same apparatus using the same catalyst described in our previous works
[11]
,
[12]
, while details about catalyst characterization are given in the more recent paper
[12]
. Briefly, it is useful to remember that the catalyst powder was coated on a cordierite monolith which is 10 mm in length and 14 mm in diameter, having 400 cpsi. The catalytic powder was washcoated dipping the monolith in an ethanol slurry until a 20% (w/w) increase was reached. Calcination was performed in reducing atmosphere (6% H2 in N2) for 4 h at 700 °C.
Activity tests were run in a quartz tube reactor heated by an electric furnace. Two thermocouples were used to record the temperature, both placed at a distance of 2 mm from the monolith, one at the inlet and the other at the outlet. The reactor is equipped with two fan coolers that blow cold air inwards from the oven outlet, this allowing to regulate precisely both the heating and the cooling rate and also to have a more uniform temperature along the reactor. The reaction products and residual reactants were measured by means of a gas analyzer composed by an IR detector a TCD and a paramagnetic detector for O2.
2.2. Activity tests
CPO activity tests were carried out feeding a CH4/O2/N2 stoichiometric mixture according to the CPO reaction (3.4/1.7/94.9% by vol.), at different gas space velocities (GHSV) and temperatures (T). The reported GHSV (h−1) was calculated as the ratio between the total volumetric flow rate (m3/h) at 20 °C and the total monolith volume (m3).
Results are reported in terms of percentage variations between inlet and outlet concentrations with respect to the inlet methane concentration,
. where Ci is the concentration (% vol) of species i and
is that of methane at the reactor inlet.
allows to easily analyse the stoichiometry of the results. When applied to methane,
is the conventional % conversion. For the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, the only one that does not involve CH4 as a reagent, similar variations of concentration between the inlet and the outlet have been used to quantify species variations, but scaled on H2O or on CO2 (for the reverse reaction). The mass balance on C always closely approaches 100%, consequently the amount of water has been calculated from H and O material balances. All plots report
with respect to the catalyst inlet temperature.
The thermodynamic equilibrium has been calculated using NASA CEA Code
[13]
. The program determines the minimum total free energy configuration by changing the relative amounts of given species in a set to be specified. Since the C balance always closes very satisfactorily with the gaseous C-bearing species measured (i.e. CH4, CO, CO2) and there were no experimental evidences of carbon formation or deposition on the catalyst, solid C has been excluded from the set of species likely be present at equilibrium. This may significantly affect the equilibrium composition at lower T, given that C (graphite) is extremely stable in the absence of oxygen. However, the catalyst activity is also negligible at the lower T and the kinetics of C (graphite) formation is sufficiently slow to make the partial equilibrium (i.e. only gas species) calculations accurate enough for our case. Equilibrium calculations refer to the inlet temperature and errors due to temperature gradients along the monolith are negligible. Indeed, the maximum difference between inlet and outlet T was 50 °C in the DR and SR tests (endothermic reactions), while it was limited to 20–40 °C in the CPO tests (the outlet temperature always being lower than the inlet one).
We already studied the activity of this 0.5/0.5% Pt/Ru catalyst for partial oxidation
[12]
, speculating that combustion and reforming of methane occurs sequentially, and that is clearly identified also by tests on the global reaction, without studying each single reaction in the mechanism. We suggested that CO2 and H2O are formed in the initial steps of the global reaction, according to the complete combustion pathway (both in time and in space within the monolith), then CO and H2 form mainly by dry and steam reforming. We also speculated that other reactions (likely WGS, both direct and reverse) could be involved, motivating this work. Evidences of the sequence are measured CO2 and H2O maximum concentrations approaching the maximum achievable with the amount of oxygen supplied and decreasing with lower GHSV (that is when the residence time increases and these species can react further to other species). The sequence has also been observed and measured with spatially resolved measurement in Rh catalytic foams by Schmidt and co-workers
[5]
.
Further activity tests feeding a higher O2 concentration with respect to the CPO stoichiometry (2.3% vs. 1.7%), provide a simple example for illustrating this evidence, including additional clues.
Results are shown in
Fig. 1
, along with the calculated equilibrium trends; several features are comparable to the case of stoichiometric O2 for CPO, discussed previously by us
[12]
: CH4 conversion approaches 100%, but only at the higher temperature, all reactions are triggered above approximately 580 °C on this catalyst, beginning with total combustion (see the O2 conversion) and then slower, endothermic reforming takes place. Main products are H2 and CO with a ratio equal 2 at the highest temperatures. As total combustion begins, CO2 and H2O approach the maximum value achievable with the amount of oxygen fed (28 and 56%, respectively, 33 and 66% being the maximum values). O2 reaches a ΔC* of 66%: with the definition given at the beginning of this section, this means that it reacted completely and acts as a limiting reactant. This confirms that the reaction pathway goes first through a complete combustion that consumes all O2; the further increase in CH4 conversion is given by reforming reactions, the latter consuming CO2 and water. CO2 and H2O trends exceed those predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium, meaning that reaction is under kinetic control.

2.3. Dry reforming (DR) activity tests
To assess if the Pt–Ru catalyst is active for dry reforming of methane, thus contributing to the CPO mechanism, we carried out tests by feeding equimolar amounts of CH4 and CO2 onto the same catalyst.
Fig. 2
shows reactant conversion obtained at different space velocities. The figure refers to tests where CH4 and CO2 concentrations a start were 2.3%; feeding an equimolar mixture with 3.4% of both CH4 and CO2 resulted in superimposed results (
is not influenced by the initial concentration). Results indicate that the Pt–Ru catalyst is active also for dry reforming, significantly converting both CO2 and CH4 to H2 and CO.

Conversion increases gradually with temperature, above approximately 450 °C. CO2 conversion is always larger than that of CH4 one, particularly at higher GHSV, but at higher T some convergence is observed, particularly at the lowest GHSV (26,000 h−1). This indicates that CO2 is also involved in other reactions. On the other hand, according to the equilibrium calculations, CO2 conversion should be slightly larger than that of CH4, with a convergence above 750 °C, but the experimental results are quite far from equilibrium, particularly and obviously at high GHSV. Increasing the residence time and temperature, equilibrium is nicely approached, confirming the active role of the catalyst and explaining the convergence of CH4 and CO2 conversions.
From the different conversion of CH4 and CO2 of
Fig. 2
we can plot the ratio
, which determines the relative importance of DR with respect to RWGS at different temperatures, being a measure of DR/(DR + RWGS). The ratio is shown in
Fig. 3
for the tests with equimolar amounts of fed CH4 and CO2. This ratio should approximate 1 in case dry reforming is occurring alone, according to the reaction stoichiometry. On the contrary,
Fig. 3
shows that the value of 1 is approached only at the lowest space velocity and the highest temperature. Being lower for other conditions, indicates that CO2 is involved in other reaction(s). We conclude that DR coexists with RWGS and that the contribution of the latter is quite large, particularly at lower temperature, with smaller contact time.

A likely side reaction is the reverse water-gas shift reaction
(5)
where CO2 reacts with H2. Accordingly, the H2/CO ratio should be 1, as expected from DR, and departures from 1 is the extent of RWGS that turns H2 into CO. This can be observed in
Fig. 4
, where CO and H2 yields from the same experiment as in
Fig. 2
are compared. The
analysis for i = CO, H2 confirms that the H2 yield is always lower than twice the methane converted (the ratio expected from DR) while the CO yield is always higher, both in the same proportion. The only exception is at the highest T and lowest GHSV (26,000 h−1), when
approaches twice the methane conversion, but this is also the case when CH4 and CO2 conversions overlap. The difference between absolute values of CO and H2 production (not shown) increases with temperature, indicating that RWGS proceeds to a greater extent at high T, consistent with its endothermic nature.

Water is actually produced during the tests, consistently with the occurrence of RWGS: in
Fig. 5
where the calculated value is reported and compared with the equilibrium. The figure clearly shows that as soon as H2 is produced (above 450 °C) some steam appears. The amount of steam produced is rather limited, but in excess of the equilibrium, particularly at higher temperatures. It confirms the relevance of the reverse water-gas shift reaction, particularly at high T, as an intermediate step together with other reforming reactions. The same behaviour was identified by Maestri et al.
[14]
while studying DR and SR on a Rh catalyst. Inspection of
Fig. 5
clearly illustrates the approach to equilibrium of the results at longer residence time, when DR gradually takes over RWGS.

Once ascertained that the catalyst is actually active also for DR (and RWGS), additional tests were carried out attempting to approximate the CH4 and CO2 concentrations measured in the CPO test, right after complete O2 consumption. We considered the CPO tests run with stoichiometric amount of oxygen (1.7%), described previously
[12]
. In other words, we tried to carry out only the second part of the reaction, after total consumption of the available oxygen, synthetically, by feeding the amounts of CH4 and CO2 left or produced at that point. These are approximately 2.2% CH4/0.78% CO2 at 100,000 h−1 and 1.8% CH4/0.75% CO2 at both 50,000 and 26,000 h−1. Results are shown in
Fig. 6
, only for the cases of GHSV = 50,000 and 26,000 h−1 that can be consistently compared by scaling with respect to the same inlet composition. Also with excess of CH4, the CO2 conversion is always higher than that of CH4, but the maximum conversions are obviously well below those detected in the DR tests reported in
Fig. 2
, with equimolar CH4/CO2 feed. The smaller CO2 inlet concentration is limiting the whole process. Comparison with the equilibrium calculations demonstrates that DR is activated by the Pt/Ru catalyst, but it remains quite a slow reaction, unless temperature or reactant concentration is raised enough.

That is confirmed by the production of CO and H2,

, well below the equilibrium prediction, with the H2 yield always lower than that of CO, just because of the occurrence of RWGS. The ratio DR/(DR + RWGS) turns out to be very similar to the results already shown for equimolar feed in

Inspecting the amount of water produced during DR tests (

) allows to observe that RWGS is actually involved. Interestingly, the amount of water produced is much lower than measured with equimolar concentration of CH4 and CO2 fed. As already reported in the literature
[15]
,
[16]
,
[17]
, water apparently increases the reaction rate and support CH4 conversion. Then, the lower conversion of methane detected with a low amount of CO2 co-fed can be explained by the lower production of water detected for these reaction conditions.

This first set of tests prove that (i) dry reforming actually occurs on this catalyst, contributing to the conversion of methane observed during the CPO tests; (ii) the reaction does not occur alone, as clearly indicated by the stoichiometry and RWGS is likely to take place; (iii) at the conditions of the CPO tests carried out, DR does not proceed significantly.
These observations suggest that other reactions take place together with DR. Besides RWGS, well spotted by the data, there must be at least another reaction that could convert methane to the high values (>90%) measured in the CPO tests. The obvious candidate is steam reforming, since steam produced by total oxidation during the first part of CPO is consumed after it reaches its maximum amount. In the following paragraphs we attempt to analyse each of these additional reactions alone.
Another piece of evidence supporting our conclusion comes from the comparison of CO2 consumption during DR and partial oxidation tests, as shown in
Fig. 9

Fig. 6
) and partial oxidation, as function of T and GHSV. HR = 20 °C/min.
The CO2 conversion in the partial oxidation tests has been calculated starting from Tin = 560 °C, when total oxidation is completed, forming the maximum CO2 (23%) allowed by the available O2 and no significant consumption by further reactions takes place yet. Accordingly, CO2 is considered a reactant, and its conversion calculated as:
. Other reactions involving CO2 become significant at higher temperature. It is clear that DR contributes to CO2 consumption, although only partially, and that is more sensitive to space velocity.
2.4. Reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction
In order to investigate the activity of the Pt/Ru catalyst for the RWGS reaction, we arranged tests in which CO2 and H2 were fed alone, together with an inert gas. Their concentration and relative amount were selected to resemble conditions met during the second stage of CPO reaction, after total combustion. Unfortunately, composition varies continuously as temperature increases, at a given GHSV and vice versa. We analysed the ratio of product and intermediate concentration, Ci/Cj (i = CO, H2 and j = CO2, CO and H2O) to identify the most common values, particularly right after total oxidation took place.
Fig. 10
shows the resulting ratios in a CPO carried out at GHSV = 50,000 h−1
[12]
. Results for other GHSV values are comparable, but the maximum values are directly proportional to the GHSV. The extreme variations indicate that both species at any ratio are involved in several simultaneous reactions. All the species considered are not present in the feed of a CPO test; accordingly, ratios that are constantly increasing indicate that overall products are being compared to intermediates, eventually disappearing. Interestingly, the ratio
is quite stable, between 2 and 3, suggesting that they are both global products, but different reactions are contributing. We have tried to study them individually.

Given the results of

, we chose to test the RWGS reaction with

and
. CO2 inlet concentration was always 0.5%. Variations of reactants and products of RWGS were quantified and compared using
as a reference, i.e.
.
Fig. 11
shows the variations of both reactants during the activity tests. At any space velocity investigated, the reaction progress is significant, beginning at rather low temperature; CO2 and H2 are consumed with to same extent, according to RWGS stoichiometry. The only product measured in significant amount was CO; H2O was calculated as usual. Both are produced according to RWGS stoichiometry. Although Ru and Pt are known to be active in the methanation reaction, CH4 was never detected in any of the RWGS reaction tests run. The space velocity slightly affects the conversions even when it reaches the highest value, 150,000 h−1, six times the lowest one. The measurements approach equilibrium above 500 °C, implying that direct water-gas shift reaction is also occurring. All these evidences lead us to conclude that the reaction is quite fast, approaching equilibrium (then negligibly affected by the residence time), and apparently facilitated by the Pt/Ru catalyst as well.

Increasing the H2/CO2 ratio from 1 to 3 causes an increase of H2 conversion, consistent with the close matching of the equilibrium, when the mass action law shifts the equilibrium to products by forcing an excess of one reagent. When H2/CO2 = 20 the conversion of H2 is much higher, at a lower temperature, reaching a maximum at 550 °C and then decreases, stabilizing at approximately 73%. In this case, the equilibrium composition is much farther away, and CO2 conversion is not precisely consistent with RWGS stoichiometry just as before. Interestingly, CO2 is much closer to the equilibrium prediction than H2, implying an involvement of CO2 in other, fast reactions.
2.5. Water-gas shift (WGS) activity tests
Following the previous results of RWGS tests, the direct water-gas shift reaction was investigated by feeding steam and CO to the same reactor and catalyst. From
Fig. 10
we can see that during CPO the CO/H2O ratio right after total oxidation is approximately 1. Accordingly, we fed equimolar CO/H2O, although this simplifies the range of compositions that can occur at higher temperature, when the ratio is much larger due to the significant production of CO. From results of the RWGS tests above, we expect to observe the counterpart of the same equilibrium, at high temperature, when it is approached, while the behaviour at lower temperature is not obvious.
Fig. 13
shows CO and H2O conversions at increasing temperature and different gas space velocities. The reaction progress is quite significant above 400 °C closely approaching equilibrium at higher temperature, also at the highest GHSV (150,000 h−1). The catalyst is then active for this reaction also, leading to the formation of CO2 and H2. As for the reverse reaction, the space velocity has a limited effect; at higher temperature the equilibrium is approached quite fast. The test carried out with an inlet ratio of 1 is not very representative of the composition measured during the CPO tests at higher temperature, when both water and CO concentrations vary in opposite directions (water decreasing and CO increasing). In the zone between 500 and 600 °C their ratio is anyway close to the one recorded during CPO tests. The fact that equilibrium is approached already at about 550 °C, the temperature where most of the CPO progress is by total combustion, implies that the WGS equilibrium becomes a principal mechanism that determines the CO/H2 production. Indeed, the unconstrained equilibrium calculations (i.e. any gas species and particularly all those involved in reactions (1–7) are allowed to be present) result in CO/H2O = 1 at any T > 550 °C, which is equal to the feed ratio and reflects the same stoichiometry as the WGS reaction, thus excluding other equilibrium reactions among these species.

Fig. 13. Steam (above) and CO (below) variations relative to H2O fed during WGS tests, as function of temperature and GHSV.
As a consequence, whenever other reactions affect the concentration of any species involved in WGS, then its equilibrium rearranges the composition accordingly. Specifically, at high temperature, the WGS reaction is not a relevant contribution to the global CPO reaction, because the steam concentration is rather low, possibly because of the sink determined by steam reforming, discussed later. Consequently, the amounts of CO2 and H2 produced by WGS are quite limited. Comparing
Fig. 13
,
Fig. 11
we can see the same equilibrium from two opposite points of view. We see that the WGS is slightly more active than the RWGS at lower temperature (WGS conversions are higher than RWGS below approximately 550 °C). This is a kinetic indication, which adds up to the fact that complete combustion of CH4 by O2 occurs first, yielding steam (reactant in WGS) in excess of CO2 (reactant in RWGS), further supporting the direct WGS.
2.6. Steam reforming (SR) tests
As previously suggested, steam reforming is an obvious candidate for explaining methane conversion when O2 is totally consumed. We fed a mixture of CH4 and H2O to verify that the reaction is actually supported by our Pt–Ru catalyst. As above, the inlet composition was chosen analysing CH4 and H2O concentrations measured during the CPO tests when CO2 and steam reached their maximum. Slightly varying with the GHSV, CH4 and H2O concentrations measured were approximately 1.65% and 1.15%, respectively. We fed CH4 and H2O alone, with the concentrations above, onto the same Pt–Ru catalyst.
Fig. 14
shows the results as function of temperature and gas space velocity. The steam reforming reaction is catalysed and it is strongly affected by the GHSV, being clearly controlled by the kinetics, far from equilibrium. At the highest GHSV, indeed, CH4 and H2O conversions are very small and overlap at all temperatures, but below 650 °C conversion is negligible. At smaller GHSV (50,000 h−1), conversion of both reactants is larger, reaching values of 21 and 27% at 800 °C, with a higher conversion of steam. At 26,000 h−1, both CH4 and H2O start being converted at quite low temperature (about 400 °C) and then their conversion rapidly increases reaching about 40%.

Again steam conversion is higher than that of CH4, between 400 and 650 °C, notwithstanding the SR stoichiometry, confirming once again that various reactions occur simultaneously, likely WGS. This is also consistent with equilibrium calculations, although conversions are smaller than predicted by thermodynamics. It is interesting to note that at the lowest space velocity, both CH4 and H2O have the same qualitative behaviour as predicted by the equilibrium, with a crossing of the H2O and CH4 conversion at about 650 °C.
H2 and CO production in SR tests is shown in
Fig. 15
; both are scaled to the inlet CH4 concentration. In addition, CO production is multiplied by 3 for an easier comparison with H2 production, following the stoichiometry. H2 production always exceeds that of CO, according to the stoichiometry of SR, but the amount of H2 is quite consistent with the CH4 consumption multiplied by 3. This can be observed in
Fig. 16
, where methane conversion multiplied by 3 is compared with H2 production. The H2 trend line is slightly higher than the CH4 one, this suggesting the simultaneous presence of some WGS reaction, as further discussed below.

Discrepancies increase at lower GHSV and temperature. This is explained observing that CO2 is also produced,

The measured CO2 formation suggests that WGS occurs simultaneously, with CO reacting with steam as soon as it is formed, also explaining the higher conversion of steam with respect to CH4. An analogous pathway is proposed by Maestri et al.
[14]
to describe the kinetics of steam reforming on a Rh catalyst. Occurrence of WGS could also explain why CO production is apparently delayed to higher temperatures than H2 (see
Fig. 15
): as soon as CO appears, it is immediately consumed by WGS, this being faster than SR, and also H2 production is enhanced.
The patterns measured in SR tests,

Fig. 15

Fig. 16
,
Fig. 17
, explain the differences observed during CPO tests with this catalyst. Increasing the GHSV, indeed, caused a marked decrease of methane conversion (see
[12]
,
Fig. 5
), explained by the different extents of SR (and DR as well) detected at varying the space velocity.
Summing up all the individual measurements above, we conclude that methane conversion obtained during stoichiometric CPO is given by the contributions of three reaction:
1.
a complete combustion step consuming all the oxygen fed, therefore explaining 25% of conversion at any temperature;
2.
a dry reforming step (methane reacting with CO2);
3.
a steam reforming step (methane converted by steam).
with WGS always present to rapidly rearrange the products and intermediates.
We can attempt to prove the above combination quantitatively by using
which is non-dimensional, specific consumption of methane, thus independent of the initial amount. The measured variation during stoichiometric CPO (3.4% of CH4 and 1.7% of O2) matches the sum of the measured contribution of total combustion, SR and DR, as shown in
Fig. 18
. At the two extreme values of GHSV tested (26,000 and 93,000 h−1) there is a quite good match.

Fig. 18. CH4 conversion measured in stoichiometric CPO tests, compared with the sum of the CH4 conversion measured during DR, SR and assuming that 25% of the conversion is given by total oxidation at all the temperatures.
It must be recalled that SR and DR results are not purely determined by the presumed reaction, but WGS is always present, closely approaching the equilibrium.
With the set of tests described in this work, we proved that the Ru–Pt catalyst supported on alumina catalyses the reaction according to the combustion and reforming mechanism, with Ru probably having a crucial role promoting the reforming reactions, in line with the results of other authors for monometallic Ru
[2]
,
[9]
and for Pt
[10]
. It emerges anyway from a careful study of the literature, that many factors contribute to address the reaction towards a certain mechanism, such as the support type, the residence time and the reaction conditions.
3. Conclusions
Through specific tests with selected mixtures, we proved that the Pt–Ru catalyst supports the indirect combustion and reforming mechanism in CPO, as already suggested in a previous work
[12]
. Further increasing the amount of oxygen fed (over-stoichiometric for the CPO), simply causes the complete combustion products to increase, at low temperature. We confirmed that the CPO reaction first yields the maximum amounts of CO2 and H2O achievable with the available O2 according to total combustion, but we investigated the subsequent reactions, individually, involving residual CH4, and CO2 and H2O produced.
The catalyst was active in catalysing all the candidate reactions (steam reforming, dry reforming and direct/reverse water-gas shift). Since the concentration of the gases fed in these tests were the same as detected during the CPO tests, right after the oxygen was completely consumed, the tests give important indications of the contribution of the single reaction tested to the global mechanism of the partial oxidation of methane.
The dry reforming tests show that CO2 can effectively react with methane producing CO and H2. The
of all the species involved in the reaction are not those predicted by the stoichiometry, CH4 conversion being higher than that of CO2 and the amount of CO produced being higher than the amount of H2. The differences decrease at higher temperature and larger contact time. Evidences lead to the conclusion that CO2 fed and H2 produced rapidly interact, according to RWGS, which is quite fast in approaching equilibrium, at a lower temperature that DR. Reforming prevails again at higher temperature and smaller GHSV. However, under typical CPO conditions, CH4 largely prevails on the achievable CO2 after O2 total consumption, and DR cannot explain much of the CH4 conversion measured in CPO, unless other paths of CH4 consumption are active.
Both the direct and the reverse water-gas shift reactions are very fast and not affected by the gas space velocity. They approach the thermodynamic equilibrium, with the direct reaction being more relevant for the global mechanism at low temperature, while the reverse reaction becomes more important at high temperature. WGS apparently determines the CPO products in the intermediate temperature range, after H2O is produced by total combustion, while at higher temperature other reactions compete for the available H2O. As an equilibrium reaction, it always rearranges the products of other, slower reaction taking place, such as DR.
The steam reforming tests showed that this reaction gives a considerable contribution mainly at the lowest GHSV, explaining the differences in the conversions detected during CPO tests. The reaction products are also constantly modified by the faster WGS, which aims at re-establishing its equilibrium while SR modifies the composition. Eventually, it appears that SR is the most relevant reaction that converts CH4 in CPO, coexisting with WGS, and significantly supported by DR at higher temperature.
The significance of the investigation on separate reactions has been further proven by the additivity of the measured results when compared to CPO yields.
