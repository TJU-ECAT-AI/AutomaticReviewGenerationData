Preferential oxidation of CO over Pt–Sn/AC catalyst: Adsorption, performance and DRIFTS studies
Abstract
Preferential CO oxidation over 1% Pt–0.25% Sn supported on nitric acid treated activated carbon (AC-N) was studied for various feed compositions including fully realistic feed. The real time performance of the catalyst and the effect of reaction parameters on its PROX activity and selectivity were investigated. Factors leading to high performance of the Pt–Sn/AC-N catalyst were scrutinized by CO and O2 adsorption and PROX tests conducted on an in situ diffuse reflectance IR Fourier transform spectroscopy system connected to a mass spectrometer (FTIR-DRIFTS-MS). CO and CO2 adsorption properties of Pt–Sn/AC-N and Pt/AC-N samples were also studied by a gravimetric analyzer. FTIR-DRIFTS-MS and adsorption studies confirmed enhanced CO chemisorption on Pt–Sn/AC-N catalyst compared to that on Pt/AC-N. The performance results showed that the presence of CO2 and H2O in the feed does not significantly affect the CO conversion performance and CO selectivity of the catalyst. In all tests, CO conversion increased with the decrease in temperature within 135–110 °C range, indicating enhancement in CO selectivity as the temperature decreases. The CO conversion of the catalyst reached for the W/F value tested was ca. 90% at 110 °C for the H2-rich feed including CO2, water vapor and methane.

1. Introduction
PEM fuels have been widely accepted as the most suitable candidate for small scale mobile and immobile energy production in near future
[1]
,
[2]
. CO-free hydrogen feed is the optimum fuel for PEMFCs; it can be produced from various hydrocarbons through a series of catalytic reactions, namely, reforming, high and low temperature water gas shift (WGS) and preferential oxidation (PROX). The effluent of reformer, which is fed to WGS unit, has ca. 10% CO. The CO concentration at the exit of WGS unit drops down to 1–2%. The WGS effluent is rich in H2 and has CO2, water vapor and CH4 regardless of the original hydrocarbon (mixture) fed to the reformer inlet. The following preferential CO oxidation step is necessary since platinum based cathode catalysts of PEM fuel cells require carbon monoxide levels as low as 1–100 ppm for stable operation
[2]
,
[3]
. Therefore, an efficient PROX unit must reduce carbon monoxide level from 1 to 2% down to below 100 ppm while suppressing possible hydrogen oxidation under the presence of CO2, water vapor and CH4.
Considering the energy efficiency of a combined fuel processor–fuel cell system, the temperature of PROX unit should be ideally in 100–130 °C range. On the other hand, most conventional CO oxidation catalysts require high temperatures, which prevent irreversible CO adsorption, for guaranteeing stable operation. Catalytic low temperature CO oxidation has two important reaction steps, which must occur simultaneously; CO chemisorption and dissociative adsorption of O2. Therefore, in order to minimize the problems that may result from adsorption competition, the catalyst should have distinct active sites for each of the reactants and/or chemisorption processes for having high and stable activity
[2]
.
The Pt–SnOx system has been studied for many years as it has shown to catalyze the CO oxidation at moderate temperatures (ca. 120 °C), where neither platinum nor tin dioxide alone has stable activity. The high activity of Pt–SnOx system has been ascribed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism in which Pt provides the adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx
[4]
. On the other hand, the reactive sites situated at the border between SnOx and Pt particles could not be distinguished; thus the possibility of oxygen spillover from tin dioxide onto Pt has been considered for Pt–SnOx/Al2O3 catalysts
[5]
.
Activated carbon (AC) is known for its high surface area and a surface chemistry that allows tailoring of surface chemical properties
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
. Activated carbon has a porous structure formed by randomly oriented carbene layers, which have oxygen bearing surface groups, especially on the low-coordinated carbon atoms present at the edges of the layers. The textural and chemical properties of the AC surface can be modified in order to enhance the catalytic properties of the AC supported catalysts
[7]
,
[8]
. In a series of papers, firstly several Pt–Sn/AC catalysts were prepared, characterized in a detailed fashion
[8]
,
[9]
and tested for their CO oxidation activities
[9]
. The results clearly showed that the CO oxidation performance of the catalyst strongly depends on Pt:Sn loading ratio, preparation procedure and AC pretreatment. The results hinted that the active phase on Pt–Sn catalyst prepared on nitric acid oxidized activated carbon (AC-N) is the Pt3Sn alloy. Pt3Sn is formed with the help of the carboxylic acid rich surface chemistry of the support and/or through the interaction between the metallic Pt phase and the SnOx interface, and have resulted in enhanced CO oxidation ability
[9]
. The activated carbon supported Pt–Sn and Pt–Ce catalysts were then used in PROX reaction under hydrogen rich feed conditions by Özkara et al.
[10]
. In that paper, the activity tests for the Pt–Sn/AC catalysts were performed for a feed stream having 1% CO, 1% O2, 60% H2 and inert He. Afterwards, Pt–Sn/AC catalysts were tested further by Şimşek et al. at 150 °C for the feed additionally containing CO2 and water vapor
[11]
. Based on the results of those initial studies, the Pt–Sn catalyst prepared on AC-N was found promising for practical applications, considering that the effluent of the water gas shift reactors has both CO2 and water vapor in an on-board fuel processor. As the active phase on Pt–Sn/AC-N is probably Pt3Sn alloy, a series of density functional studies have been carried out on CO–Pt3Sn and (CO + O)–Pt3Sn systems; the results of those works, which also include simulations on CO–Pt system as the comparison basis, well revealed that (i) the alloy leads to a decrease in CO adsorption strength, (ii) it limits the number of possible sites for CO adsorption compared to those on Pt surface, and (iii) it provides specific and distinct sites for oxygen adsorption in the close neighborhood of the CO-adsorbing sites

Schubert et al.
[15]
have investigated PROX on vulcan supported Pt–Sn catalysts and obtained higher activity and selectivity than commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at low temperatures. Their temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), in situ diffuse reflectance IR Fourier transform spectroscopy, and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) measurements revealed that (i) CO surface coverage on the metallic particles is high and decreases with temperature, (ii) only part of the Sn is reduced, included in PtSn alloy particles, while another part forms SnOx islands beside the active particles. They suggested that the reaction takes place in a bifunctional way at the perimeter of the SnOx islands on/adjacent to PtSn particles or by a spill-over process.
In this work, PROX over Pt–Sn/AC-N and Pt/AC-N systems has been studied by using FTIR-DRIFTS-MS system under operando conditions with a feed including CO, H2, O2 and He. Adsorption properties of CO and CO2 have been studied by using gravimetric analyzer at reaction temperatures. In the performance tests on-line-real-time PROX activity profiles of an AC supported system for fully realistic feed were obtained. In this context, preferential CO oxidation performance of the 1% Pt–0.25% Sn/AC-N catalyst was studied and determined for various feed conditions including the realistic feed, i.e. a H2-rich feed including CO2, water vapor and CH4, in order to understand the effect of reaction parameters on the PROX activity and selectivity.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of nitric acid oxidized activated carbon support (AC-N) and Pt–Sn/AC-N catalyst
Commercial activated carbon, kindly supplied by NORIT (NORIT ROX), was crushed and sieved into 45–60 mesh size (344–255 μm). The HCl washed sample, AC-H, was prepared by the treatment of the sample with 2 N HCl to remove some ash content and accompanying sulfur. Upon rinsing and drying at 388 K overnight, AC-H was placed in a round bottom flask containing 5 N HNO3 solution, heated to the boiling temperature and kept under total reflux for 3 h. Afterwards, the nitric acid oxidized sample, AC-N, was rinsed several times and then the slurry was dried at 388 K overnight.
1 wt% Pt–0.25 wt% Sn/AC-N catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation (Sn + Pt) in which impregnation of acidic aqueous tin chloride solution was followed by heat treatment under He flow at 673 K and then by impregnation of aqueous hexachloroplatinic acid precursor. 1 wt% Pt/AC-N catalyst was prepared by impregnation of aqueous hexachloroplatinic acid precursor. All impregnation steps were conducted under mild vacuum. After the impregnation step, the samples were dried overnight at 373 K. The catalysts were calcined in situ under He with flow rate of 50 cm3/min at 673 K for 2 h and then reduced by H2 with flow rate of 50 cm3/min at 673 K for 10 h prior to the reactions. The reduction was conducted for 10 h in order to stabilize the surface.
2.2. Characterization of the AC-N support and Pt–Sn/AC-N catalyst
Detailed characterization including the TPD, SEM, XPS studies and BET surface area measurements of the support
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
and TPR, XPS, SEM, XRD and H2 adsorption studies of bimetallic Pt–Sn/AC-N catalyst
[8]
,
[9]
were conducted and published earlier. In this work, FTIR-DRIFTS-MS and CO/CO2 adsorption/desorption studies were presented.
2.2.1. DRIFTS measurements
IR measurements were obtained in a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Bruker, Vertex V70) using a diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform Spectrometer (DRIFTS) reaction cell (PIKE technologies). The DRIFTS cell was equipped with a ZnSe window, had connections for inlet and outlet gas flows. It also included a heating element and a thermocouple, which provided the feedback to a temperature controller to maintain the cell temperature constant. A total of 256 scans were recorded per spectrum over the range of 4000–600 cm−1 at a resolution of 2 cm−1. To improve the reflectivity of the samples, the catalysts were diluted with KBr at a ratio of KBr:catalyst, 20:1.
Operando FTIR-DRIFT spectra of Pt–Sn/AC-N and Pt/AC-N catalysts were obtained under PROX reaction conditions which resulted in the highest CO conversion levels (50 cm3/min; 1% CO, 1.25% O2, 60% H2, balance He) at 135 °C and 110 °C during the performance tests (see Sections
2.3 Catalytic performance tests
,
3.2 Performance tests over Pt–Sn/AC-N
). The catalyst samples were calcined and reduced prior to the reaction or adsorption studies. A spectrum of KBr recorded in He served as background. The DRIFTS cell outlet was connected to a Hiden analytical mass spectrometer to monitor the conversion levels. Transmission experiments such as CO adsorption and O2 adsorption in which no reactions were involved, were carried out with different compositions of CO or O2 under He flow. For both experiments, KBr spectrum recorded under inert flow was used as background. The IR spectra of AC-H and AC-N supports were also obtained using KBr spectrum under inert flow as background in order to identify bands belonging to surface groups of the support.
2.2.2. Adsorption studies
Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms were obtained for fresh AC-N, Pt/AC-N and Pt–Sn/AC-N samples by using Intelligent gravimetric analyzer (Hiden Isochema). High purity CO and CO2 gasses were connected directly to the analyzer. The adsorption and desorption isotherms of all samples were obtained at room temperature, 110 °C, 115 °C, 125 °C and 135 °C. Before adsorption runs 50–100 mg samples were outgassed at room temperature for 24 h to remove water vapor.
2.3. Catalytic performance tests
The catalytic performance tests were conducted in a down-flow, 65 cm long 1/4 in. OD, stainless steel tubular microreactor. The catalyst bed was fixed in the middle of the reactor by glass wool. The temperature of the catalyst bed was controlled with ±0.1 K precision via a programmable temperature controller (Eurotherm 3216P). The flow rates of high purity gasses supplied from high-pressure gas cylinders (hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, helium, and methane) were controlled by Brooks mass flow controllers. The water flow rate was controlled by an Agilent 1200 HPLC pump; water fed to the system was evaporated before it was introduced into the feed gas mixture. All transfer lines in reaction and analysis sections of the system were kept at 398 K to prevent possible condensation. Two ice traps were used to remove water vapor from the product stream prior to the analysis. Thermo Model 48i CO analyzer and Agilent Technologies 6850 gas chromatograph equipped with CTR-I column were used for analyzing feed and product gas streams. The CO analyzer guaranteed high CO sensitivity (0.1 ppm) and continuous on-line-real-time analysis.
The total flow rate was kept constant at 100 cm3/min and the catalyst weight was 0.25 g ensuring constant W/Ftot in the PROX performance tests. The preliminary tests indicated no activity loss/stability problem for Pt–Sn/AC-N system tested. Based on that, for each freshly reduced sample, the reaction was conducted at four different temperature levels, i.e. at 135 °C, 125 °C, 115 °C and 110 °C, in a decreasing temperature progression (DTP) fashion. For each DTP cycle on each catalyst sample, (i) PROX conducted over freshly reduced sample for 4 h at 135 °C first, then (ii) the reaction temperature was decreased to 125 °C at which the reaction was conducted for 2 h, and finally, (iii) step (ii) was repeated for 115 °C and 110 °C. It should be noted that even with the applied 10 h reduction, the catalyst was found continuously activating as the reaction proceeded due to partial reoxidation of the catalytic surface. Considering this fact, the length of the first part of DTP cycle at 135 °C was used as 4 h. The feed concentrations were changed systematically in an experimentally designed fashion aiming to understand the effects of all gasses, present at the WGS unit effluent of a practical fuel processor, on the PROX performance behavior of Pt–Sn/AC-N.
Table 1
shows the reaction parameters used in the PROX tests. The experiments were performed in four experimental sets: (I) The catalyst was tested for the ideal feed mixture having CO, O2, H2 and balance He; (II) CO2 and water vapor was added to the feed mixture; (III) CH4 was added to the ideal feed mixture; (IV) The PROX performance of the catalyst was tested for the fully realistic feed, having CO2, CH4 and H2O at the same time, mimicking the effluent of a WGS unit present in a practical fuel processor.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. DRIFTS and adsorption studies
In order to analyze the processes taking place over the catalysts during PROX reaction in detail, the catalysts have been analyzed by operando-FTIR-DRIFTS-MS.
Fig. 1
a and b shows the DRIFTS results for Pt/AC-N and Pt–Sn/AC-N catalysts, respectively, before reaction and after exposure to reaction mixture (50 cm3/min; 1% CO, 1.25% O2, 60% H2, balance He).

Fig. 1
shows typical DRIFT spectra obtained under PROX conditions over Pt/AC-N and Pt–Sn/AC-N catalsyts. More specifically, the spectra refer to conditions as established 5 min after switching from He to reaction mixture (CO, O2, H2, and He) at 135 °C and atmospheric pressure. 5 min time-on-stream (TOS) corresponds to a stable gas phase composition of the reactor effluent confirmed by MS.
The spectral zone in the 3800–2800 cm−1 range displays bands mostly attributable to hydroxyl species. In both cases, the spectra are dominated by a broad band extending along this range and displaying a maximum at ca. 3250 cm−1, which is attributed to O–H stretches from hydroxyl, phenolic and carboxylic groups
[16]
,
[17]
,
[18]
,
[19]
. This band diminishes for AC-H sample after the HCl treatment and gains intensity due to HNO3 treatment for AC-N (not shown). The weak and broad band at 3600 cm−1 is assigned to the O–H stretching vibration in free –OH
[18]
. The observed increase in peak intensity of 3250 cm−1 band is significant for Pt/AC-N and Pt–Sn/AC-N catalysts during DRIFTS-MS reaction tests. This increase was ∼2 folds (190%) for Pt/AC-N and 113% for Pt–Sn/AC-N catalyst which is in agreement with the evolution of PROX; reaction intermediate hydroxyl species diminish to a lower value due to production of water for Pt–Sn/AC-N catalyst having greater activity. The band at ∼2875 cm−1 appearing in all spectra can be attributed to formate species present on the catalysts which are unaffected from the reaction at any temperature

The feature extending from 2380 to 2270 cm−1 is associated with the asymmetric stretching vibration of gas-phase CO2
[3]
,
[21]
. The carbon dioxide signal mainly originates from ambient air absorption in the optical path outside the DRIFTS cell. This spectral region is therefore not evaluated, as CO2 variations in the ambience are usually larger than those in the DRIFTS cell. The spectra taken under reaction conditions contain vibro-rotational transitions associated with gaseous CO, the maximum of the R-branch appearing at 2166 cm−1 and that of the Q-branch appearing at 2105 cm−1
[22]
. No bands corresponding to linearly adsorbed (∼2060 cm−1) or bridged adsorbed CO (∼1825 cm−1) were observed for neither catalysts
[15]
.
All spectra contain broad bands associated with the chemistry of the AC-N support in the 1800–700 cm−1 region. The peak near 1750 cm−1 is attributed to CO band in carboxylic, lactones and anhydrides
[16]
,
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]
. The peak near 1600 cm−1 is associated with the quinone functional groups
[16]
,
[24]
which are present in AC-N support. The broad peak at 1250 cm−1 is the C–O stretching in carboxylic anhydrides phenols ethers and lactones
[24]
. And the 800 cm−1 band can be attributed to aromatic C–H out-of plane bending vibrations
[26]
,
[27]
.
The 3250 cm−1, 1750 cm−1 and 1250 cm−1 bands indicate the presence of carboxylic acid groups on the surface of the catalyst. Since Pt–Sn/AC-N does not have the 1750 cm−1 band (
Fig. 1
b) which is present in the DRIFT spectra of the AC-N support (not shown), it can be concluded that upon calcination and reduction treatments of the catalyst, the carboxylic acid groups were decomposed. Decomposition of the carboxylic acid groups during pretreatment steps leads to mobility of the metallic precursors originally anchored to them and enhance the Pt–Sn interaction which results in the formation of Pt3Sn alloy
[8]
,
[9]
.
Since the gaseous CO signal completely cover the CO adsorption band on the AC-based catalysts
[15]
under the reaction conditions, it is possible that the linearly adsorbed CO band overlaps the gaseous CO signal. For further investigation of adsorption over catalyst samples, individual CO adsorption and O2 adsorption DRIFTS tests were conducted on both catalysts at 110 °C. The CO adsorption experiments were conducted under 1%, 6%, 10% and 20% CO levels with balance inert flow.
Fig. 2
a and b shows the DRIFT spectra of Pt/AC-N and Pt–Sn/AC-N, respectively. The bands attributed to the adsorption of CO on Pt are absent in the spectrum of Pt/AC-N. Since Pt/AC-N catalyst is inactive for CO oxidation
[9]
and our preliminary studies show that it is inactive for PROX as well, no change upon CO exposure was observed as expected. The intensity of the 3250 cm−1 band has slighty increased due to increase in the CO amount in the mixture. This increase was 5.7% under 1%CO–He mixture flow. The increase in the intensity of 3250 cm−1 band in the case of Pt–Sn/AC-N is only 2.3%.
Fig. 2
c presents the DRIFT spectra of the two catalyst samples under 1% CO–He mixture flow. The linearly adsorbed CO band (∼2054 cm−1) was observed only for Pt–Sn/AC-N, however bridged adsorbed CO band which would appear near 1820 cm−1, was not present
[15]
. It is known from surface science studies that CO is linearly adsorbed on Pt (1 1 1) surface, but above 0.33 cm3 coverage limit, direct repulsive forces between adsorbed CO molecules start to dominate due to the decreased distance between CO molecules and bridge type adsorption becomes more stable than atop adsorption. On the other hand, the flat potential energy surface accompanied with the lack of a lateral adsorbate interaction, enables the existence of linear adsorption on the Pt3Sn (1 1 1) surface
[28]
,
[29]
which is in accordance with our current results.

The O2 adsorption experiments were conducted under 1.25%, 6% and 20% O2 and balance inert flow. The intensity increase of the 3250 cm−1 band as a result of higher oxygen content in the feed was observed for both catalysts, the rise in response to increase in O2 concentration being more significant for Pt–Sn/AC-N (not shown). The % increase of the band is 18.8 and 21.0 for Pt/AC-N and Pt–Sn/AC-N, respectively.
Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms were obtained for fresh AC-N, Pt/AC-N and Pt–Sn/AC-N at room temperature, 110 °C, 115 °C, 125 °C and 135 °C. A representative plot of CO2 and CO adsorption isotherms of Pt–Sn/AC-N sample is given in
Fig. 3
. The adsorption data were fitted to standard isotherm models; Langmuir and Dubinin–Radushkevich. The best fitting isotherm model was Dubinin–Radushkevich which has the form:
and ɛ is the adsorption potential given by the expression
where a denotes the amount of gas adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent, a0 is the micropore capacity, E is the characteristic energy of adsorption, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in K, P0 is the saturation pressure and P is the equilibrium pressure
[30]
. The regression coefficients and the constants for the adsorption of CO2 on the adsorbents are presented in
Table 2
. It should be noted that as a0 values obtained for AC3 and Pt/AC3 confirm each other for the whole temperature range, those values can be considered as a measure of micropore volume. On the other hand, the a0 values obtained for Pt–Sn/AC3 sample slightly deviates from those obtained for AC3 and Pt/AC3 most probably due to the double calcination procedures applied on that sample and the consequent changes in its structure.

. The value of heat of adsorption on Pt–Sn/AC-N and Pt/AC-N decreased slightly from 33.1 kJ/mol to 28.9 kJ/mol and from 33.7 kJ/mol to 29.0 kJ/mol, respectively, while CO2 loading (i.e. the adsorbed amount of CO2) increased from 0.4% to 0.8%. As a result of increased CO2 loading there was a smaller decrease in the isosteric heat of adsorption of AC-N sample led by weak repulsive interactions between adsorbed CO2 molecules
[31]
and the value of Q was about 35 kJ/mol. Results indicate that the difference in the strength of CO2 adsorption on AC-N, Pt/AC-N and Pt–Sn/AC-N is within ca. 0.8 kJ/mol (
Table 2
). Thus, the heat of adsorption values of CO2 on Pt/AC-N and Pt–Sn/AC-N samples are very close. It is known that CO2 addition to the feed diminishes CO oxidation activity and stability of metal oxide supported Pt–SnOx systems
[11]
,
[32]
due to the presence of mobile CO2 on the support impeding O2 transfer. This negative effect is eliminated for Pt–Sn/AC-N due to the properties of both its support and alloy type active sites. Its support has significantly greater CO2 adsorption capacity compared to those of Pt/AC-N and AC-N led by the decomposition of its carboxylic acid groups during its double calcination and reduction steps leaving available sites ready for CO2 adsorption on its support. Although CO2 adsorption strength of Pt–Sn/AC-N is slightly lower, its surface has capacity to adsorb and stabilize CO2. Its alloy type active centers have ensembles of Pt atoms for CO adsorption and Sn- and Sn–Pt ensembles for O-adsorption on the alloy surface at the atomic distances. By this way, the necessity of O-spillover (or transfer) through the support is completely eliminated.

The results of the CO adsorption studies indicate that CO adsorption on the samples should have chemical nature. On the other hand, the CO adsorption behavior could not be explained by any of the standard models. Thus, it should be somehow an activated type adsorption besides its – should be – chemical nature.
Fig. 5
a–c shows the adsorption isotherms of Pt/AC-N and Pt–Sn/AC-N catalysts at different pressure ranges. In the pressure range of 300–1200 mbar CO adsorption capacity of Pt–Sn/AC-N is much higher than Pt/AC-N and CO mass uptake increases as the temperature increases. Contrarily, the CO mass uptake of Pt–Sn/AC-N sample at 50 mbar at the PROX test temperatures are ca. 0.032% (110 °C), 0.022% (115 °C), 0.01% (125 °C) and 0.005% (135 °C). Repeated tests have shown that the mass uptake of the Pt–Sn/AC-N at 110 °C is significantly higher than that measured at the other temperatures studied for this pressure level, which is vey close to the CO partial pressure used in the performance tests. High CO mass uptake of Pt–Sn/AC-N at 110 °C under PROX conditions is one of the primary reasons of its high activity.

3.2. Performance tests over Pt–Sn/AC-N
Since PROX catalysts suffer from activity loss/stability problems especially at low temperatures, performance of catalyst samples in their freshly reduced forms at each temperature level was compared with the performance of a sample used in a full DTP cycle in the preliminary tests in order to understand whether there is an activity loss in the used sample. The results indicated neither an activity loss nor CO poisoning in the used samples.
CO conversion (XCO), and selectivity for CO oxidation in excess hydrogen (SCO) were defined as:
Throughout the experimental sets, the oxygen conversion was always 100% and the product analysis by GC revealed no methane formation. Considering the importance of time on stream activity profiles of PROX catalysts in transient operations, on-line-real-time CO activity/selectivity profiles the Pt–Sn catalyst are given for the conditions mentioned above whenever necessary.
3.2.1. PROX tests with “ideal” hydrogen rich feed
Tests with ideal hydrogen rich feed (1% CO, 1% O2, 60% H2 and balance He) clearly indicated that the CO conversion increases with a decrease in temperature. Considering the fact that oxygen present in the feed was used up completely in all tests, increase in CO conversion shows the increase in CO selectivity of the catalyst with a decrease in reaction temperature. The stable CO conversion levels reached at 110 °C, 115 °C and 125 °C are 88, 85 and 81% (
Fig. 6
a) with selectivities 41, 43 and 44.5%, respectively (not shown). It should be noted that in the current and the following TOS tests, selectivity profiles follow the same trend as the corresponding conversion profiles. These results are consistent with the gravimetric CO adsorption studies which revealed CO mass uptake increase from 0.005 to 0.036% as the temperature decreased from 135 to 110 °C for low pressures.

Fig. 6. (a) PROX performance of Pt–Sn/AC-N as CO conversion under ideal feed flow at O2:CO = 1:1 and (b) the effect of O2 feed concentration on CO conversion under ideal feed flow at 135 °C.
Increased oxygen concentration in the feed (SET I. 5–8) shortened the time necessary for reaching the stable CO conversion level at the first step of DTP cycle (
Fig. 6
b). The results revealed that as the O2 concentration in the feed increases, the time necessary for establishing equilibrium surface concentrations of O2 and CO is shorter. Another important fact is that the immediate hydroxyl group accumulation on the surface, as observed in the DRIFTS studies led by O2 exposure, carries the CO conversion level to 40% in a very short time. Those results clearly indicate the crucial importance of O2 level in the feed stream; it should be determined carefully for the optimum PROX performance of the catalyst. CO conversion results show that higher O2 concentration (CO:O2 = 1:1.25) led to a rise in CO conversion levels for the whole temperature range; for example, CO conversion rose from 88% to 95% at 110 °C with the increase in CO:O2 ratio from 1 to 1.25 (not shown). It should be also noted that in this and the following TOS performance tests there is a slight increase in activity though we have applied 10 h reduction treatment. It seems the reason may be surface oxygen and – as an additional oxygen source – OH build-up during reaction.
3.2.2. The effect of CO2 and H2O presence on PROX activity
When CO2 and water vapor were added to the ideal feed stream, the CO conversion activity rose with the decrease in temperature indicating the increase in CO selectivity at lower reaction temperatures (SET II). The comparison of the activity profiles obtained in SET I. 1–4 and SET II.1–4 (not shown) clearly shows that the addition of CO2 and water vapor does not significantly change the PROX activity level of the Pt–Sn system for 110–135 °C range; the CO conversion levels were 88, 84, 83 and 75% at 110, 115, 125 and 135 °C, respectively.
Several groups have studied the effect of CO2 and H2O addition on the activity and the selectivity of various catalysts including the 110–135 °C temperature range. For Pt–Au/ceria catalysts, CO2 and H2O addition to feed has resulted in a decrease of activity due to carbonate and carboxylate adsorption and water blockage on active sites
[33]
. CO2 in feed impeded CO oxidation reaction for Pt–Pd/ceria catalysts. H2O addition, however, promoted a significant increase in CO oxidation activity for the same system; when both H2O and CO2 were present in the feed, the CO oxidation rate was enhanced
[34]
. Manasilp et al.
[32]
have obtained similar results for Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. For water enhancement of CO conversion they proposed two reasons: water enhances the water gas shift reaction and hydroxyl groups formed upon adsorption of water on the surface of the catalyst is a better oxidant than O2, therefore enhances the CO oxidation rate. On the other hand, Ayastuy et al. have reported the inhibition of Pt/ceria catalyst activity and selectivity with H2O addition to feed due to the fact that formation of hydroxyl groups on the surface of ceria hinders CO adsorption
[35]
. Their results revealed activity and selectivity enhancement with CO2 addition to the feed.
It should be noted that in our previous study, PROX activity increase of Pt–Sn/AC-N system was observed at 150 °C upon the addition of H2O and CO2
[14]
. Contrarily, Nibbelke et al.
[36]
have reported an enhancement of the CO oxidation rate by steam addition on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts as the temperature decreases. Pt–Sn/AC-N catalyst was tested negative for water gas shift reaction activity at 150 °C which eliminates the possibility of CO conversion due to WGS at elevated temperatures. Therefore our results may be attributed to (i) the limited effect of CO2 on CO oxidation activity led by both the properties of the AC-N support and the Pt3Sn type active sites having specific O- and CO-adsorption sites at atomic distances (see Section
3.1
), eliminating the problems involved with oxygen transfer under CO2 presence and (ii) the limited enhancement of complex surface mechanism by water vapor at lower reaction temperatures. It should be noted that our CO2 adsorption studies revealed CO2 is adsorbed weakly on Pt–Sn/AC-N. Besides, the low coordinated carbon atoms, which are formed upon the decomposition of surface carboxylic groups of AC during catalyst pretreatment, may limit the mobility of CO2 on support as previously mentioned
[14]
.
On the contrary to the trend observed in SET I, the increase in O2:CO ratio in the feed did not lead to an increase in CO conversion level; the stable activity of the catalyst dropped down to ca. 70% CO conversion level for the whole temperature range in experiments of SET II. 5–8. This implies that the hydrogen selectivity increases with the increase in oxygen concentration when the feed has CO2 and water vapor; in speculatively talking, this may stem from the relatively higher surface oxygen concentration, which makes hydrogen oxidation relatively easier under the given conditions. As will be seen for SET IV tests, on the other hand, this effect loses its importance when CH4 is also added to the feed stream.
3.2.3. The effect of CH4 presence on PROX activity
Considering the fact that the outlet of the WGS units of a fuel processor has methane independent from the type of hydrocarbon fed to the reformer unit, the effect of methane presence in the feed must be studied for a PROX catalyst. On the other hand, interestingly, the related literature offers very limited PROX performance test results obtained for the feed including methane. In SET III tests, the effect of methane presence on the PROX activity of Pt–Sn/AC-N was studied in detail for individual addition of methane to the ideal H2-rich feed.
Addition of methane to the feed used in SET I. 1–4 reduced the CO conversion significantly at 135 °C from ca. 75% to ca. 50% (
Fig. 7
a). The chromatographic data showed that there is insignificant methane oxidation at 135 °C as well as at other lower temperature levels; thus, the possible explanation for the observed decrease in CO conversion level may be the adsorption competition between CH4 and the CO oxidation reactants. The CO selectivity for both idealistic feed and upon methane addition to the feed at 135 °C followed a similar trend and dropped ca. 37.5% to ca. 30% upon methane addition. As the reaction temperature decreases, the suppression of PROX activity loses its strength, in SET III. 2–4; the CO conversion levels rose close to 90% at 110 °C (
Fig. 7
b).

Fig. 7. The effect of methane presence in the feed on CO conversion at (a) 135 °C and O2:CO = 1:1; (b) T = 110–125 °C and O2:CO = 1:1; (c) T = 110–125 °C and O2:CO = 1.25:1.
In response to the increase in O2:CO ratio in the feed in SET III. 5, the CO conversion level rose to ca. 70%, almost 10% above the level that was obtained in SET III. 1 at 135 °C. (not shown). On the other hand, with a decrease in temperature to 125 °C and 115 °C, the real time CO oxidation activity of the catalyst followed a profile passing through a minimum first before reaching the stable conversion levels (
Fig. 7
c). This type of profile, which was confirmed by duplicated experiments, was not observed under any other reaction condition tested, and hints the presence of an induction period for the stabilization of surface concentrations of the species. With further decrease in reaction temperature to 110 °C, the conversion profile fit the expected trend and reached ca. 85% within 2 h TOS.
3.2.4. PROX activity under fully realistic conditions
In order to study the PROX performance of Pt–Sn/AC-N under real conditions, the feed streams having CO2, H2O and CH4 were used. A comparison between the results obtained from SET III. 1 and SET IV. 1 clearly shows that under CH4 presence, addition of H2O and CO2 decreased the conversion level to ca. 45% at 135 °C (not shown). The decrease in reaction temperature led to an increase in CO conversion values; the conversion level was 57% at 110 °C in SET IV. 4 (
Fig. 8
a). As can be seen easily, under “lean” oxygen conditions, the CO conversion values were far below the acceptable levels. A simple comparison between SET I. 4, SET II. 4, SET III. 4 and SET IV. 4 indicate that under lean oxygen feeding (i) presence of neither individual addition of CH4 nor the addition of CO2 and H2O to ideal feed cause any decrease in CO conversion level, which was ca. 88–90% in all those tests, but (ii) combined addition of CH4, CO2 and H2O to the ideal feed significantly reduced the conversion. Since the active Pt3Sn sites offer specific adsorption sites for CO and O, which eliminates any CO2-involved transfer problem experienced in Pt–SnOx (NMRO) systems, and considering the fact that a limited level of H2 oxidation occurred inevitably; the most plausible reason for the lowered activity is that the oxygen level in the feed led to a low O surface concentration that can be used in oxidation of CO. Our theoretical findings showed that the Pt3Sn active centers have ensembles of Pt atoms for CO adsorption, and Sn- and Sn–Pt ensembles for O-adsorption on the alloy surface at the atomic distances
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
. Owing to that, the necessity of O-spillover (or transfer) through the support is completely eliminated. Thus, on the basis of our current experimental results and our previous experimental and theoretical findings as well, we can suggest a basic CO oxidation surface mechanism for “CO and O2”-only feed on Pt3Sn sites involving the following steps:
1
CO (g) → CO·Pt
2
O2 (g) → O·Sn  and/or  O2 (g) → O·PtSn
CO·Pt + O·Sn → CO2 (g)  and/or  CO·Pt + O·PtSn → CO2·(g)

Although additional kinetic studies with the realistic PROX feed are surely necessary in order to explain water activation, presence of H2 and H2O in the feed stream seems to add intermediate steps to the above mechanism, one of those steps should involve hydroxyl groups as indicated by the DRIFTS results:
OH·Sn → O·Sn  and/or  OH·PtSn → O·PtSn.
The results of the tests conducted with higher O2:CO ratio in the feed, SET IV. 5–8, support the above postulate on negative effect led by scarcity of oxygen: the CO conversion levels reached the levels obtained from the tests conducted with the ideal feed when O2:CO ratio was increased to 1.25. A comparison between 135 °C tests for realistic feed with different oxygen levels (
Fig. 8
b) clearly shows the enhancement in CO conversion from ca. 46% to ca. 75% upon the increase in O2:CO feed ratio from 1 to 1.25. Under realistic feed conditions with O2:CO = 1.25, the CO conversion levels reached 84, 88 and 89% at 125 °C, 115 °C and 110 °C, respectively (not shown).
4. Conclusions
The overall evaluation of the performance test results at 110 °C (
Fig. 9
) shows that Pt–Sn/AC-N is a very promising PROX catalyst to be used in fuel processors; it reached ca. 90% conversion level with a realistic feed having O2:CO = 1.25. It is clear from both performance tests and DRIFTS/adsorption studies that Pt3Sn alloy formation on surface oxygen group rich AC-N support has led to augmented CO adsorption and faster surface reaction involving intermediate hydroxyl groups which bring along increase in CO conversion and selectivity as the temperature decreases within the range of 110–135 °C. On the activated carbon support, nitric acid oxidation creates a surface very rich in carboxylic acid type surface groups forming anchoring sites for the metal precursors. As carboxylic acid groups decompose during pretreatment steps, the anchored metal precursors become mobile; as a consequence, two vital processes which predominantly determine stable catalytic activity occur: (i) as the metal precursors become free, extensive intermetallic interaction between Pt and Sn helps the formation of Pt3Sn alloy sites, and (ii) the metallic/alloy structures formed are strongly anchored on the free (low-coordinated) surface carbon sites which were formed upon the decomposition of the carboxylic acid groups in the neighborhood

. The stable activity of the catalyst stems from the stabilized alloy sites on low-coordinated carbons; those Pt3Sn alloy sites have ensembles of Pt atoms for CO adsorption, and Sn- and Sn–Pt ensembles for O- (and probably OH-) adsorption at the atomic distances enabling a bifunctional active surface. Besides the high CO oxidation activity and the fact that CO adsorption does not lead to CO poisoning, weak CO2 adsorption strength of the catalyst limits CO2 inhibition during PROX reaction.
