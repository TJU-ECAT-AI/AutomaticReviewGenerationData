Heterogeneous Reactions: 
Analysis, Examples, and Reactor 
Design

These large volumes represent a major 
effort to integrate the theory and industrial 
examples 
of multiphax reaction engineering, 
with emphasis on interactions between mass 
and heat transport and chemical reaction. 
The result is the most comprehensive 
account 
o
f
 this subject, 
a valuable source of important 
results, and a useful entry into the literature. 
The authors deserve credit for attempting to 
unify the subject, but their success 
is limited 
by the state of development of reaction en- 
gineering. 
There are far too few experimental 
results available for in-depth, quantitative 
analyses 
of industrial 
processes; consequently, 
the connections 
between the theoretical and 
experimental results are not very deep or 
satisfying. This work highlights the need for 
more detailed industrial data to allow con- 
solidation of the theoretical progress and 
better guidance in reactor design. 
Some of the newer topics engaging reac- 
tion engineers are introduced in the book 
(e.g.. supported enzymes and metal complex 
catalysts), 
but the authors have not addressed 
molecular concepts; typical of books in re- 
action engineering, this one lacks a chemical 
orientation. The major technological oppor- 
tunities are offered by new chemical struc- 
tures, reaction pathways, and catalysts, not 
by new reactors or manipulation of interac- 
tions of transport and reaction processes; 
perhaps, this book will challenge future au- 
thors to integrate chemical concepts into re- 
action engineering. 
The Doraiswamy and Sharma volumes are 
well produced and fairly priced. They are a 
commendable advanced treatise, recom- 
mended to practicing engineers and as a 
supplementary reference for graduate 
courses in reaction engineering.

Bimetallic Catalvsts: 
Discoveries, Concepts, and 
Applications 
by John 
H. Sinfelt, 
John 
Wiley & Sons, 1983. XI + 
164 pp. 
Bimetallic 
catalysts find wide application, 
especially in the petroleum industry. They 
offer the potential of improved selectivity 
and better activity maintenance as 
compared 
to catalysts containing only one metal. John 
H. Sinfelt’s 
book, the first in a series 
of Exxon 
Monographs, gives a detailed and exciting 
account of research on bimetallic catalysts 
from the vantage point of one of the leading 
pioneers in this area. Although most of the 
work discussed in the book has already ap- 
peared in the open scientific literature, the 
book brings twenty years of research at 
Exxon’s catalysis 
laboratories 
into context and 
makes it easier for the reader to appreciate 
the development of concepts and ideas con- 
cerning bimetallic catalysts. 
The book starts with a review of selectivity 
aspects of bimetallic catalysts comprised of 
metals from Group VIII and Ib in hydrocar- 
bon reactions such as hydrogenolysis, hy- 
drogenation, dehydrogenation, and isomer- 
ization. Then, the question of bimetallic 
cluster formation in systems containing im- 
miscible metal components is addressed. 
Results on highly dispersed, supported 
ruthenium-copper catalysts are compared 
with ruthenium-copper single crystal studies 
carried out by G. Ertl’s group in Munich. 
Special 
emphasis is placed on a description of 
how physical probes such as EXAFS can 
successfully 
be used to obtain structural in- 
formation on well dispersed, supported 
ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper 
clusters. Subsequently, work on platinum- 
iridium is reviewed bringing Mossbauer 
spectroscopy 
into the picture as an additional 
physical characterization tool for bimetallic 
cluster catalysts. 
The final 
chapter of the book 
concentrates on the major industrial appli- 
cation of bimetallic catalysts for reforming 
o
f
 petroleum. 
This book 
makes interesting reading not 
only for the scientist or engineer directly in- 
volved in bimetallic catalysis, but Serves as 
an 
example of the scientific research endeavor 
in general, demonstrating how new concepts 
and insights are developed on the basis of 
carefully posed questions followed by key 
experiments, ultimately culminating in im- 
portant industrial applications.
