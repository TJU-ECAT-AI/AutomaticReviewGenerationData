[1] "The catalyst is 0.5% Ru and 0.5% Pt (w/w) supported on mixture of alumina, ceria and zirconia (75/4.4/20.6%, w/w), washcoated on a ceramic monolith."

[2] "CPO activity tests were carried out feeding a CH4/O2/N2 stoichiometric mixture according to the CPO reaction (3.4/1.7/94.9% by vol.), at different gas space velocities (GHSV) and temperatures (T)."

[3] "Results indicate that the PtRu catalyst is active also for dry reforming, significantly converting both CO2 and CH4 to H2 and CO."

[4] "Both the direct and the reverse water-gas shift reactions are very fast and not affected by the gas space velocity. They approach the thermodynamic equilibrium, with the direct reaction being more relevant for the global mechanism at low temperature, while the reverse reaction becomes more important at high temperature."

[5] "The steam reforming tests showed that this reaction gives a considerable contribution mainly at the lowest GHSV, explaining the differences in the conversions detected during CPO tests."

The bimetallic PtRu catalyst studied in this paper demonstrates activity for multiple reactions relevant to methane conversion, including catalytic partial oxidation (CPO), dry reforming, water-gas shift (WGS), and steam reforming. 

For CPO, the catalyst promotes a combustion and reforming mechanism, with complete oxidation occurring first followed by reforming reactions. The PtRu catalyst is active for dry reforming, converting CO2 and CH4 to H2 and CO. Both forward and reverse WGS reactions occur rapidly on this catalyst, approaching equilibrium and rearranging product compositions. Steam reforming contributes significantly to methane conversion, especially at lower gas hourly space velocities.

The bimetallic nature of the catalyst likely contributes to its versatility in catalyzing multiple reaction pathways. Ru appears to play an important role in promoting reforming reactions. However, this study does not provide direct comparisons to monometallic catalysts or UHV studies on model surfaces.

Future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide valuable insights by:
1) Elucidating the specific roles of Pt and Ru sites in activating different reactants
2) Examining how alloying affects electronic properties and adsorbate binding
3) Investigating reaction intermediates and mechanisms at the atomic scale
4) Correlating surface structure to reactivity for different reaction pathways

Such fundamental studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially guiding the design of improved bimetallic catalysts for methane conversion processes. However, replicating the complex reaction conditions and support effects in UHV remains challenging.

本文研究的双金属PtRu催化剂表现出对甲烷转化相关的多种反应的活性,包括催化部分氧化(CPO)、干重整、水气变换(WGS)和蒸汽重整。

对于CPO,该催化剂促进了燃烧和重整机制,首先发生完全氧化,然后进行重整反应。PtRu催化剂对干重整有活性,将CO2和CH4转化为H2和CO。正向和反向WGS反应在该催化剂上都能快速进行,接近平衡并重新排列产物组成。蒸汽重整对甲烷转化贡献显著,尤其是在较低的气体小时空速下。

催化剂的双金属性质可能是其能够催化多种反应途径的原因。Ru似乎在促进重整反应中起着重要作用。然而,这项研究并没有直接与单金属催化剂或模型表面的超高真空研究进行比较。

未来在Pt基双金属表面上进行的超高真空研究可能提供宝贵的见解:
1) 阐明Pt和Ru位点在活化不同反应物中的具体作用
2) 研究合金化如何影响电子性质和吸附剂结合
3) 在原子尺度上研究反应中间体和机理
4) 将表面结构与不同反应途径的反应活性相关联

这些基础研究可以帮助弥合模型表面和负载型催化剂之间的差距,可能指导改进的双金属催化剂设计用于甲烷转化过程。然而,在超高真空中复制复杂的反应条件和载体效应仍然具有挑战性。
