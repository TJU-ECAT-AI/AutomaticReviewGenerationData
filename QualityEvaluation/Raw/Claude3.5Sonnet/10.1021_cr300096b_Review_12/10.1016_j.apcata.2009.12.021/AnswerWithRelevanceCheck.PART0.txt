          [1] "The catalyst is 0.5% Ru and 0.5% Pt (w/w) supported on mixture of alumina, ceria and zirconia (75/4.4/20.6%, w/w), washcoated on a ceramic monolith."

[2] "We already studied the activity of this 0.5/0.5% Pt/Ru catalyst for partial oxidation, speculating that combustion and reforming of methane occurs sequentially, and that is clearly identified also by tests on the global reaction, without studying each single reaction in the mechanism."

[3] "Through specific tests with selected mixtures, we proved that the PtRu catalyst supports the indirect combustion and reforming mechanism in CPO, as already suggested in a previous work."

[4] "The catalyst was active in catalysing all the candidate reactions (steam reforming, dry reforming and direct/reverse water-gas shift)."

[5] "Both the direct and the reverse water-gas shift reactions are very fast and not affected by the gas space velocity. They approach the thermodynamic equilibrium, with the direct reaction being more relevant for the global mechanism at low temperature, while the reverse reaction becomes more important at high temperature."

[6] "The steam reforming tests showed that this reaction gives a considerable contribution mainly at the lowest GHSV, explaining the differences in the conversions detected during CPO tests."

[7] "Results indicate that the PtRu catalyst is active also for dry reforming, significantly converting both CO2 and CH4 to H2 and CO."

          The bimetallic PtRu catalyst studied in this work influences the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in several ways:

1. It supports an indirect combustion and reforming mechanism for catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of methane, where complete combustion occurs first, followed by reforming reactions.

2. The catalyst is active for multiple reactions involved in methane conversion, including steam reforming, dry reforming, and both direct and reverse water-gas shift reactions.

3. For the water-gas shift reaction, both forward and reverse reactions proceed very quickly on the PtRu catalyst, approaching thermodynamic equilibrium and not being significantly affected by gas space velocity. The direct reaction is more relevant at low temperatures, while the reverse reaction becomes more important at high temperatures.

4. In steam reforming, the catalyst's activity is more pronounced at lower gas hourly space velocities (GHSV), which explains differences in methane conversion observed during CPO tests.

5. The catalyst is also active for dry reforming, converting both CO2 and CH4 to H2 and CO.

6. The bimetallic nature of the catalyst, combining Pt and Ru, likely contributes to its effectiveness across multiple reaction pathways, with Ru probably playing a crucial role in promoting reforming reactions.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights by:

1. Investigating the surface chemistry and adsorption properties of Pt-Ru alloys to understand how the bimetallic nature influences reactivity.

2. Examining the oxidation state and distribution of Pt and Ru atoms on model surfaces to correlate with catalyst performance.

3. Studying the interaction of reaction intermediates with Pt-Ru surfaces to elucidate reaction mechanisms at the molecular level.

4. Comparing results from model Pt-Ru surfaces with supported catalysts to bridge the gap between idealized and real catalytic systems.

However, UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces can be challenging due to the complexity of alloy surfaces and the difficulty in preparing well-defined bimetallic model systems. Overcoming these limitations could provide crucial insights into the fundamental principles governing the catalytic behavior observed in reactor studies.

          本研究中所研究的双金属PtRu催化剂通过以下几种方式影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机理和效率：

1. 它支持甲烷催化部分氧化（CPO）的间接燃烧和重整机制，其中先发生完全燃烧，然后进行重整反应。

2. 该催化剂对甲烷转化涉及的多种反应都具有活性，包括蒸汽重整、干重整以及正向和逆向水煤气变换反应。

3. 对于水煤气变换反应，PtRu催化剂使正向和逆向反应都能非常快速地进行，接近热力学平衡，且不受气体空速的显著影响。在低温下正向反应更为相关，而在高温下逆向反应变得更重要。

4. 在蒸汽重整中，催化剂的活性在较低的气体小时空速（GHSV）下更为显著，这解释了CPO测试中观察到的甲烷转化差异。

5. 该催化剂对干重整也有活性，将CO2和CH4转化为H2和CO。

6. 催化剂的双金属性质，即Pt和Ru的结合，可能是其在多种反应途径中都有效的原因，其中Ru可能在促进重整反应中起着关键作用。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供以下洞见：

1. 研究Pt-Ru合金的表面化学和吸附特性，以了解双金属性质如何影响反应活性。

2. 检查模型表面上Pt和Ru原子的氧化态和分布，以与催化剂性能相关联。

3. 研究反应中间体与Pt-Ru表面的相互作用，以阐明分子水平的反应机理。

4. 比较模型Pt-Ru表面与负载型催化剂的结果，以弥合理想化和实际催化系统之间的差距。

然而，由于合金表面的复杂性和制备明确定义的双金属模型系统的困难，对基于Pt的双金属表面进行UHV研究可能具有挑战性。克服这些限制可能会为反应器研究中观察到的催化行为的基本原理提供关键见解。
