[1] "The catalyst is 0.5% Ru and 0.5% Pt (w/w) supported on mixture of alumina, ceria and zirconia (75/4.4/20.6%, w/w), washcoated on a ceramic monolith."

[2] "We already studied the activity of this 0.5/0.5% Pt/Ru catalyst for partial oxidation, speculating that combustion and reforming of methane occurs sequentially, and that is clearly identified also by tests on the global reaction, without studying each single reaction in the mechanism."

[3] "Once ascertained that the catalyst is actually active also for DR (and RWGS), additional tests were carried out attempting to approximate the CH4 and CO2 concentrations measured in the CPO test, right after complete O2 consumption."

[4] "The catalyst is then active for this reaction also, leading to the formation of CO2 and H2. As for the reverse reaction, the space velocity has a limited effect; at higher temperature the equilibrium is approached quite fast."

[5] "Through specific tests with selected mixtures, we proved that the PtRu catalyst supports the indirect combustion and reforming mechanism in CPO, as already suggested in a previous work."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The bimetallic PtRu catalyst studied in this work influences the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in several ways:

1. It supports the indirect combustion and reforming mechanism in catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of methane, where complete combustion occurs first, followed by reforming reactions.

2. The catalyst is active for dry reforming (DR), reverse water-gas shift (RWGS), water-gas shift (WGS), and steam reforming (SR) reactions, all of which contribute to the overall CPO process.

3. For the WGS reaction, the catalyst approaches equilibrium quickly at higher temperatures, with space velocity having a limited effect.

4. The PtRu catalyst promotes reforming reactions, likely due to the presence of Ru.

5. The catalyst's activity in these reactions explains the differences observed in methane conversion during CPO tests at varying space velocities.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into:

1. The specific roles of Pt and Ru in each reaction step.
2. Surface interactions between the metals and reactants/intermediates.
3. The effect of support materials on catalyst performance.
4. The nature of active sites on the bimetallic surface.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may make it challenging to directly correlate findings with supported catalysts under realistic reaction conditions. Bridging this gap would require developing techniques to study more complex model surfaces and in-situ characterization methods.

2. 该催化剂对干重整(DR)、逆水煤气变换(RWGS)、水煤气变换(WGS)和蒸汽重整(SR)反应都有活性，这些反应都对整个CPO过程有贡献。

3. 对于WGS反应，该催化剂在较高温度下快速接近平衡，空速的影响有限。

4. PtRu催化剂促进重整反应，可能是由于Ru的存在。

5. 该催化剂在这些反应中的活性解释了在不同空速下进行CPO测试时观察到的甲烷转化差异。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The bimetallic PtRu catalyst studied in this paper demonstrates activity for multiple reactions relevant to methane conversion, including catalytic partial oxidation (CPO), dry reforming, water-gas shift (WGS), and steam reforming. 

For CPO, the catalyst promotes a combustion and reforming mechanism, with complete oxidation occurring first followed by reforming reactions. The PtRu catalyst is active for dry reforming, converting CO2 and CH4 to H2 and CO. Both forward and reverse WGS reactions occur rapidly on this catalyst, approaching equilibrium and rearranging product compositions. Steam reforming contributes significantly to methane conversion, especially at lower gas hourly space velocities.

The bimetallic nature of the catalyst likely contributes to its versatility in catalyzing multiple reaction pathways. Ru appears to play an important role in promoting reforming reactions. However, this study does not provide direct comparisons to monometallic catalysts or UHV studies on model surfaces.

Future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could provide valuable insights by:
1) Elucidating the specific roles of Pt and Ru sites in activating different reactants
2) Examining how alloying affects electronic properties and adsorbate binding
3) Investigating reaction intermediates and mechanisms at the atomic scale
4) Correlating surface structure to reactivity for different reaction pathways

Such fundamental studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially guiding the design of improved bimetallic catalysts for methane conversion processes. However, replicating the complex reaction conditions and support effects in UHV remains challenging.

本文研究的双金属PtRu催化剂表现出对甲烷转化相关的多种反应的活性,包括催化部分氧化(CPO)、干重整、水气变换(WGS)和蒸汽重整。

对于CPO,该催化剂促进了燃烧和重整机制,首先发生完全氧化,然后进行重整反应。PtRu催化剂对干重整有活性,将CO2和CH4转化为H2和CO。正向和反向WGS反应在该催化剂上都能快速进行,接近平衡并重新排列产物组成。蒸汽重整对甲烷转化贡献显著,尤其是在较低的气体小时空速下。

催化剂的双金属性质可能是其能够催化多种反应途径的原因。Ru似乎在促进重整反应中起着重要作用。然而,这项研究并没有直接与单金属催化剂或模型表面的超高真空研究进行比较。

未来在Pt基双金属表面上进行的超高真空研究可能提供宝贵的见解:
1) 阐明Pt和Ru位点在活化不同反应物中的具体作用
2) 研究合金化如何影响电子性质和吸附剂结合
3) 在原子尺度上研究反应中间体和机理
4) 将表面结构与不同反应途径的反应活性相关联

这些基础研究可以帮助弥合模型表面和负载型催化剂之间的差距,可能指导改进的双金属催化剂设计用于甲烷转化过程。然而,在超高真空中复制复杂的反应条件和载体效应仍然具有挑战性。

The bimetallic Pt-Ru catalyst studied in this work influenced the mechanisms and efficiencies of several reactions relevant to methane conversion:

1. It supported an indirect combustion and reforming mechanism for catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of methane, where complete combustion occurred first, followed by reforming reactions.

2. The catalyst was active for steam reforming, dry reforming, and both direct and reverse water-gas shift reactions. This allowed for efficient conversion of methane and rearrangement of products.

3. Water-gas shift reactions were very fast on this catalyst, approaching thermodynamic equilibrium and not affected by gas space velocity. The forward reaction was more important at low temperatures, while the reverse reaction dominated at high temperatures.

4. The catalyst promoted steam reforming, which was a significant contributor to methane conversion, especially at lower gas hourly space velocities.

5. Dry reforming also occurred, becoming more significant at higher temperatures.

These findings from reactor studies provide valuable insights into the behavior of bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts. Future UHV studies could potentially:

1. Investigate the surface chemistry and adsorption properties of Pt-Ru alloys to understand how the bimetallic nature influences reactivity.

2. Examine the oxidation state and distribution of Pt and Ru atoms on model surfaces to correlate with catalyst performance.

3. Study the interaction of reaction intermediates with Pt-Ru surfaces to elucidate reaction mechanisms at the molecular level.

4. Compare results from model Pt-Ru surfaces with supported catalysts to bridge the gap between idealized and real catalytic systems.

However, UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces can be challenging due to the complexity of alloy surfaces and the difficulty in preparing well-defined bimetallic model systems. Overcoming these limitations could provide crucial insights into the fundamental principles governing the catalytic behavior observed in reactor studies.

The bimetallic PtRu catalyst studied in this paper shows good activity and selectivity for CO and H2 production, as well as good stability. It catalyzes the partial oxidation of methane through a combustion and reforming mechanism, with Ru likely playing a key role in promoting reforming reactions. 

The catalyst is active for several key reactions:

1. Water-gas shift (WGS) and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reactions proceed very quickly, approaching thermodynamic equilibrium. WGS is more relevant at low temperatures, while RWGS becomes more important at high temperatures.

2. Steam reforming contributes significantly, especially at lower gas hourly space velocities (GHSV). This explains differences in conversion observed during catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) tests at varying space velocities.

3. Dry reforming also occurs, though to a lesser extent than steam reforming under typical CPO conditions.

The study demonstrates how the bimetallic PtRu catalyst influences the mechanisms and efficiencies of these reactions in reactor studies. However, it does not provide direct insights from UHV studies on model surfaces. Future UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could potentially help correlate these reactor findings with surface-level phenomena, though the paper does not discuss current limitations of such UHV studies. Combining reactor studies like this one with UHV experiments on model catalysts could provide a more complete understanding of the catalytic mechanisms at both the macro and molecular scales.
