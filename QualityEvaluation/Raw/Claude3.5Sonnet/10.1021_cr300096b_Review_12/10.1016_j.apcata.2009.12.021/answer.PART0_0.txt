[1] "The catalyst is 0.5% Ru and 0.5% Pt (w/w) supported on mixture of alumina, ceria and zirconia (75/4.4/20.6%, w/w), washcoated on a ceramic monolith."

[2] "We already studied the activity of this 0.5/0.5% Pt/Ru catalyst for partial oxidation, speculating that combustion and reforming of methane occurs sequentially, and that is clearly identified also by tests on the global reaction, without studying each single reaction in the mechanism."

[3] "Once ascertained that the catalyst is actually active also for DR (and RWGS), additional tests were carried out attempting to approximate the CH4 and CO2 concentrations measured in the CPO test, right after complete O2 consumption."

[4] "The catalyst is then active for this reaction also, leading to the formation of CO2 and H2. As for the reverse reaction, the space velocity has a limited effect; at higher temperature the equilibrium is approached quite fast."

[5] "Through specific tests with selected mixtures, we proved that the PtRu catalyst supports the indirect combustion and reforming mechanism in CPO, as already suggested in a previous work."

The bimetallic PtRu catalyst studied in this work influences the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in several ways:

1. It supports the indirect combustion and reforming mechanism in catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of methane, where complete combustion occurs first, followed by reforming reactions.

2. The catalyst is active for dry reforming (DR), reverse water-gas shift (RWGS), water-gas shift (WGS), and steam reforming (SR) reactions, all of which contribute to the overall CPO process.

3. For the WGS reaction, the catalyst approaches equilibrium quickly at higher temperatures, with space velocity having a limited effect.

4. The PtRu catalyst promotes reforming reactions, likely due to the presence of Ru.

5. The catalyst's activity in these reactions explains the differences observed in methane conversion during CPO tests at varying space velocities.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into:

1. The specific roles of Pt and Ru in each reaction step.
2. Surface interactions between the metals and reactants/intermediates.
3. The effect of support materials on catalyst performance.
4. The nature of active sites on the bimetallic surface.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may make it challenging to directly correlate findings with supported catalysts under realistic reaction conditions. Bridging this gap would require developing techniques to study more complex model surfaces and in-situ characterization methods.

本研究中所研究的双金属PtRu催化剂以几种方式影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机理和效率：

1. 它支持甲烷催化部分氧化(CPO)中的间接燃烧和重整机理，先发生完全燃烧，然后进行重整反应。

2. 该催化剂对干重整(DR)、逆水煤气变换(RWGS)、水煤气变换(WGS)和蒸汽重整(SR)反应都有活性，这些反应都对整个CPO过程有贡献。

3. 对于WGS反应，该催化剂在较高温度下快速接近平衡，空速的影响有限。

4. PtRu催化剂促进重整反应，可能是由于Ru的存在。

5. 该催化剂在这些反应中的活性解释了在不同空速下进行CPO测试时观察到的甲烷转化差异。

未来的UHV研究可能会提供以下方面的见解：

1. Pt和Ru在每个反应步骤中的具体作用。
2. 金属与反应物/中间体之间的表面相互作用。
3. 载体材料对催化剂性能的影响。
4. 双金属表面上活性位点的性质。

然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究方面的限制可能使得难以直接将发现与实际反应条件下的负载型催化剂相关联。弥合这一差距需要开发研究更复杂模型表面的技术和原位表征方法。
