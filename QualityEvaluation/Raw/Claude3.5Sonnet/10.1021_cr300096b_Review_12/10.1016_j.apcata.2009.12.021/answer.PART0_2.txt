[1] "The catalyst is 0.5% Ru and 0.5% Pt (w/w) supported on mixture of alumina, ceria and zirconia (75/4.4/20.6%, w/w), washcoated on a ceramic monolith."

[2] "We already studied the activity of this 0.5/0.5% Pt/Ru catalyst for partial oxidation, speculating that combustion and reforming of methane occurs sequentially, and that is clearly identified also by tests on the global reaction, without studying each single reaction in the mechanism."

[3] "Through specific tests with selected mixtures, we proved that the PtRu catalyst supports the indirect combustion and reforming mechanism in CPO, as already suggested in a previous work."

[4] "The catalyst was active in catalysing all the candidate reactions (steam reforming, dry reforming and direct/reverse water-gas shift)."

[5] "Both the direct and the reverse water-gas shift reactions are very fast and not affected by the gas space velocity. They approach the thermodynamic equilibrium, with the direct reaction being more relevant for the global mechanism at low temperature, while the reverse reaction becomes more important at high temperature."

The bimetallic Pt-Ru catalyst studied in this work influenced the mechanisms and efficiencies of several reactions relevant to methane conversion:

1. It supported an indirect combustion and reforming mechanism for catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of methane, where complete combustion occurred first, followed by reforming reactions.

2. The catalyst was active for steam reforming, dry reforming, and both direct and reverse water-gas shift reactions. This allowed for efficient conversion of methane and rearrangement of products.

3. Water-gas shift reactions were very fast on this catalyst, approaching thermodynamic equilibrium and not affected by gas space velocity. The forward reaction was more important at low temperatures, while the reverse reaction dominated at high temperatures.

4. The catalyst promoted steam reforming, which was a significant contributor to methane conversion, especially at lower gas hourly space velocities.

5. Dry reforming also occurred, becoming more significant at higher temperatures.

These findings from reactor studies provide valuable insights into the behavior of bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts. Future UHV studies could potentially:

1. Investigate the surface chemistry and adsorption properties of Pt-Ru alloys to understand how the bimetallic nature influences reactivity.

2. Examine the oxidation state and distribution of Pt and Ru atoms on model surfaces to correlate with catalyst performance.

3. Study the interaction of reaction intermediates with Pt-Ru surfaces to elucidate reaction mechanisms at the molecular level.

4. Compare results from model Pt-Ru surfaces with supported catalysts to bridge the gap between idealized and real catalytic systems.

However, UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces can be challenging due to the complexity of alloy surfaces and the difficulty in preparing well-defined bimetallic model systems. Overcoming these limitations could provide crucial insights into the fundamental principles governing the catalytic behavior observed in reactor studies.

在这项研究中，双金属Pt-Ru催化剂影响了与甲烷转化相关的几种反应机理和效率：

1. 它支持甲烷催化部分氧化(CPO)的间接燃烧和重整机理，首先发生完全燃烧，然后是重整反应。

2. 该催化剂对蒸汽重整、干重整以及正向和逆向水气变换反应都有活性。这允许高效转化甲烷并重新排列产物。

3. 在这种催化剂上，水气变换反应非常快，接近热力学平衡，不受气体空速的影响。在低温下正向反应更重要，而在高温下逆向反应占主导地位。

4. 该催化剂促进蒸汽重整，这是甲烷转化的重要贡献者，尤其是在较低的气体小时空速下。

5. 干重整也会发生，在较高温度下变得更加显著。

这些来自反应器研究的发现为双金属Pt-Ru催化剂的行为提供了宝贵的见解。未来的超高真空(UHV)研究可能：

1. 研究Pt-Ru合金的表面化学和吸附特性，以了解双金属性质如何影响反应活性。

2. 检查模型表面上Pt和Ru原子的氧化态和分布，以与催化剂性能相关联。

3. 研究反应中间体与Pt-Ru表面的相互作用，以阐明分子水平的反应机理。

4. 比较模型Pt-Ru表面与负载型催化剂的结果，以弥合理想化和实际催化系统之间的差距。

然而，由于合金表面的复杂性和制备明确定义的双金属模型系统的困难，对基于Pt的双金属表面进行UHV研究可能具有挑战性。克服这些限制可能会为反应器研究中观察到的催化行为的基本原理提供关键见解。
