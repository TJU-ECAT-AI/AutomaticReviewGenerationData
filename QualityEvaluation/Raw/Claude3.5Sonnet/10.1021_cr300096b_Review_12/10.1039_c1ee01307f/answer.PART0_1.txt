[1] "Considerable efforts have been made to obtain highly dispersed RuSex particles with high concentrations of surface sites, thus enhancing the mass activity."

[2] "Regarding the role of Se, Alonso-Vante held that chalcogen additives protected the Ru metal from oxidation."

[3] "According to the dual pathway mechanism proposed by Breiter and co-workers,911 the intermediate COads generated in the indirect pathway can be strongly adsorbed on the Pt surface, and the reaction active sites on the Pt become occupied, leading to a severe decrease in reaction kinetics."

[4] "In general, the bifunctional mechanism and ligand effect (electronic effect) were proposed to account for the enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of PtMe catalysts for MOR."

The literature does not directly address the specific question about bimetallic catalysts and their influence on CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The provided information is mainly focused on fuel cell catalysts, particularly for methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions. 

However, some general principles can be inferred:

1. Bimetallic catalysts, especially Pt-based ones, can enhance reaction kinetics through bifunctional mechanisms and electronic effects.

2. The addition of a second metal (like Ru) can protect the primary metal (Pt) from oxidation and modify its electronic properties.

3. The dispersion and surface site concentration of catalysts play crucial roles in their activity.

4. Intermediate species like COads can strongly adsorb on catalyst surfaces, occupying active sites and decreasing reaction kinetics.

These principles might be applicable to CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions, but specific studies would be needed to confirm this. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into the atomic-scale interactions between reactants and bimetallic surfaces, helping to correlate reactor study findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, the current literature does not provide information on limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

文献并未直接回答关于双金属催化剂及其对反应器研究中CO氧化、水气变换反应和甲烷转化影响的具体问题。所提供的信息主要集中在燃料电池催化剂上，特别是甲醇氧化和氧还原反应。

然而，可以推断出一些一般原则：

1. 双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，可以通过双功能机制和电子效应增强反应动力学。

2. 添加第二种金属（如Ru）可以保护主要金属（Pt）免受氧化，并修改其电子性质。

3. 催化剂的分散度和表面位点浓度在其活性中起着至关重要的作用。

4. 中间物种如COads可以强烈吸附在催化剂表面，占据活性位点并降低反应动力学。

这些原则可能适用于CO氧化、水气变换反应和甲烷转化，但需要进行具体研究来确认。未来的UHV研究可能会为反应物与双金属表面之间的原子尺度相互作用提供洞见，有助于将反应器研究结果与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联。然而，目前的文献并未提供关于Pt基双金属表面UHV研究限制的信息。
