[1] "The bifunctional mechanism and ligand effect (electronic effect) were proposed to account for the enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of PtMe catalysts for MOR."

[2] "According to Norskov's work,96Pd was recognised to bind oxygen too firmly (more strongly than Pt) for efficient removal of the adsorbed reaction intermediates and the recovery of ORR active sites."

[3] "Recently, Jinnouchi et al. showed site-dependent dissolution potentials of Pt particles in which Pt atoms at edges, due to their higher d-band centres, dissolved more easily than Pt atoms on flat surfaces."

The literature does not directly address bimetallic catalyst mechanisms for CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, or methane conversion in reactor studies. It focuses mainly on electrocatalysis in fuel cells. However, some general principles about bimetallic catalysts can be inferred:

1. Bimetallic catalysts like PtMe (Me = other metal) can enhance catalytic activity through bifunctional mechanisms and electronic effects. The second metal can provide additional active sites or modify the electronic structure of Pt.

2. The binding strength of reactants/intermediates is crucial for catalytic activity. For example, Pd binds oxygen too strongly for efficient ORR, suggesting an optimal binding strength is needed.

3. The structure of bimetallic catalysts affects their properties. Edge sites on Pt particles have different dissolution potentials than flat surfaces due to electronic differences.

These principles likely apply to other reactions like CO oxidation or water-gas shift, though specific mechanisms would differ. UHV studies could provide atomic-level insights into how the second metal modifies Pt's electronic structure and binding properties on model surfaces, helping explain reactivity trends observed in reactor studies. However, the literature does not discuss current limitations of UHV studies on Pt bimetallics.

这篇文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水气变换反应或甲烷转化的机理。它主要集中在燃料电池的电催化方面。然而,我们可以推断出一些关于双金属催化剂的一般原理:

1. 像PtMe(Me=其他金属)这样的双金属催化剂可以通过双功能机制和电子效应来增强催化活性。第二种金属可以提供额外的活性位点或修改Pt的电子结构。

2. 反应物/中间体的结合强度对催化活性至关重要。例如,Pd与氧的结合太强,不利于高效的ORR,这表明需要一个最佳的结合强度。

3. 双金属催化剂的结构影响其性质。由于电子差异,Pt颗粒的边缘位点与平面位点相比具有不同的溶解电位。

这些原理可能适用于其他反应,如CO氧化或水气变换,尽管具体机理会有所不同。UHV研究可以提供原子级的见解,说明第二种金属如何修改模型表面上Pt的电子结构和结合性质,有助于解释反应器研究中观察到的反应性趋势。然而,文献中并未讨论当前UHV研究对Pt双金属的局限性。
