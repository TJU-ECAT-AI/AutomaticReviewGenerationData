[1] "Regarding this issue, considerable advances have been made with low-Pt alloys and core-shell-like catalysts, as well as non-platinum PdMe, RuSe and heat-treated MeNxCy-based catalysts."

[2] "For instance, it was reported that the electrocatalytic activity of a PtRu catalyst with a Ru-decorated Pt surface in MOR was twice higher for optimised Ru coverage as compared to Johnson Matthey PtRu black (Pt:Ru = 1:1) alloy catalysts."

[3] "In terms of the bifunctional mechanism in PtRu catalysts, another concern is the state of Ru. Some studies have emphasised the role of the metallic state of Ru in the bifunctional mechanism."

[4] "For example, Gottesfeld's group claimed that the surface alloying of Pt and metallic Ru is responsible for the enhanced activity for MOR by in situ probing of the PtRu catalyst surface."

The literature does not directly address bimetallic catalysts' influence on CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. It mainly focuses on methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). 

The document discusses PtRu bimetallic catalysts for MOR, noting that Ru-decorated Pt surfaces show higher activity than PtRu alloys. It mentions the bifunctional mechanism, where Pt and Ru play complementary roles in the catalytic process. The metallic state of Ru is emphasized as important for this mechanism.

While the literature does not discuss UHV studies or model surfaces explicitly, it does highlight the importance of surface structure and composition in determining catalytic activity. This suggests that UHV studies could potentially provide valuable insights into the atomic-scale mechanisms underlying the observed reactor performance of bimetallic catalysts.

However, the document does not provide specific information about CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, or methane conversion. To fully answer the question, additional research focused on these specific reactions and UHV studies of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces would be necessary.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂对反应器研究中CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的影响。它主要集中在直接甲醇燃料电池(DMFCs)中的甲醇氧化反应(MOR)和氧还原反应(ORR)。

文档讨论了用于MOR的PtRu双金属催化剂，指出Ru修饰的Pt表面比PtRu合金表现出更高的活性。它提到了双功能机制，其中Pt和Ru在催化过程中扮演互补角色。强调Ru的金属态对这一机制很重要。

虽然文献没有明确讨论UHV研究或模型表面，但它确实强调了表面结构和成分在决定催化活性方面的重要性。这表明UHV研究可能为双金属催化剂在反应器中观察到的性能提供有价值的原子尺度机制洞察。

然而，该文档并未提供关于CO氧化、水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化的具体信息。要全面回答这个问题，还需要进行针对这些特定反应和基于Pt的双金属表面UHV研究的额外研究。
