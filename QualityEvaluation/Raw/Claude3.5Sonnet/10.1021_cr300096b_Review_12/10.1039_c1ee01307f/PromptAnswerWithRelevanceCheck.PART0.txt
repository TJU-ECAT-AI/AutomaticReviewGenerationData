[1] "Regarding this issue, considerable advances have been made with low-Pt alloys and core-shell-like catalysts, as well as non-platinum PdMe, RuSe and heat-treated MeNxCy-based catalysts."

[2] "For instance, it was reported that the electrocatalytic activity of a PtRu catalyst with a Ru-decorated Pt surface in MOR was twice higher for optimised Ru coverage as compared to Johnson Matthey PtRu black (Pt:Ru = 1:1) alloy catalysts."

[3] "In terms of the bifunctional mechanism in PtRu catalysts, another concern is the state of Ru. Some studies have emphasised the role of the metallic state of Ru in the bifunctional mechanism."

[4] "For example, Gottesfeld's group claimed that the surface alloying of Pt and metallic Ru is responsible for the enhanced activity for MOR by in situ probing of the PtRu catalyst surface."

The literature does not directly address bimetallic catalysts' influence on CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. It mainly focuses on methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). 

The document discusses PtRu bimetallic catalysts for MOR, noting that Ru-decorated Pt surfaces show higher activity than PtRu alloys. It mentions the bifunctional mechanism, where Pt and Ru play complementary roles in the catalytic process. The metallic state of Ru is emphasized as important for this mechanism.

While the literature does not discuss UHV studies or model surfaces explicitly, it does highlight the importance of surface structure and composition in determining catalytic activity. This suggests that UHV studies could potentially provide valuable insights into the atomic-scale mechanisms underlying the observed reactor performance of bimetallic catalysts.

However, the document does not provide specific information about CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, or methane conversion. To fully answer the question, additional research focused on these specific reactions and UHV studies of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces would be necessary.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂对反应器研究中CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的影响。它主要集中在直接甲醇燃料电池(DMFCs)中的甲醇氧化反应(MOR)和氧还原反应(ORR)。

文档讨论了用于MOR的PtRu双金属催化剂，指出Ru修饰的Pt表面比PtRu合金表现出更高的活性。它提到了双功能机制，其中Pt和Ru在催化过程中扮演互补角色。强调Ru的金属态对这一机制很重要。

虽然文献没有明确讨论UHV研究或模型表面，但它确实强调了表面结构和成分在决定催化活性方面的重要性。这表明UHV研究可能为双金属催化剂在反应器中观察到的性能提供有价值的原子尺度机制洞察。

然而，该文档并未提供关于CO氧化、水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化的具体信息。要全面回答这个问题，还需要进行针对这些特定反应和基于Pt的双金属表面UHV研究的额外研究。

[1] "Considerable efforts have been made to obtain highly dispersed RuSex particles with high concentrations of surface sites, thus enhancing the mass activity."

[2] "Regarding the role of Se, Alonso-Vante held that chalcogen additives protected the Ru metal from oxidation."

[3] "According to the dual pathway mechanism proposed by Breiter and co-workers,911 the intermediate COads generated in the indirect pathway can be strongly adsorbed on the Pt surface, and the reaction active sites on the Pt become occupied, leading to a severe decrease in reaction kinetics."

[4] "In general, the bifunctional mechanism and ligand effect (electronic effect) were proposed to account for the enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of PtMe catalysts for MOR."

The literature does not directly address the specific question about bimetallic catalysts and their influence on CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The provided information is mainly focused on fuel cell catalysts, particularly for methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions. 

However, some general principles can be inferred:

1. Bimetallic catalysts, especially Pt-based ones, can enhance reaction kinetics through bifunctional mechanisms and electronic effects.

2. The addition of a second metal (like Ru) can protect the primary metal (Pt) from oxidation and modify its electronic properties.

3. The dispersion and surface site concentration of catalysts play crucial roles in their activity.

4. Intermediate species like COads can strongly adsorb on catalyst surfaces, occupying active sites and decreasing reaction kinetics.

These principles might be applicable to CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions, but specific studies would be needed to confirm this. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into the atomic-scale interactions between reactants and bimetallic surfaces, helping to correlate reactor study findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, the current literature does not provide information on limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

文献并未直接回答关于双金属催化剂及其对反应器研究中CO氧化、水气变换反应和甲烷转化影响的具体问题。所提供的信息主要集中在燃料电池催化剂上，特别是甲醇氧化和氧还原反应。

然而，可以推断出一些一般原则：

1. 双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，可以通过双功能机制和电子效应增强反应动力学。

2. 添加第二种金属（如Ru）可以保护主要金属（Pt）免受氧化，并修改其电子性质。

3. 催化剂的分散度和表面位点浓度在其活性中起着至关重要的作用。

4. 中间物种如COads可以强烈吸附在催化剂表面，占据活性位点并降低反应动力学。

这些原则可能适用于CO氧化、水气变换反应和甲烷转化，但需要进行具体研究来确认。未来的UHV研究可能会为反应物与双金属表面之间的原子尺度相互作用提供洞见，有助于将反应器研究结果与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联。然而，目前的文献并未提供关于Pt基双金属表面UHV研究限制的信息。

The literature does not directly address bimetallic catalysts' effects on water gas shift reaction or methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does discuss how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies:

Pt-based bimetallic catalysts enhance CO oxidation through bifunctional mechanisms and electronic effects. The secondary metal helps activate water dissociation at lower potentials, promoting oxidation of CO adsorbed on Pt sites. It also alters Pt's electronic properties to weaken CO adsorption.

CO oxidation is structure-sensitive, affected by factors like crystal face, pH, defects, nanoparticle size/shape. However, the literature does not discuss potential insights from future UHV studies on correlating reactor findings with model surfaces.

The document focuses on electrocatalysis in fuel cells rather than typical heterogeneous catalysis reactors or UHV studies. More research would be needed to draw connections between these different experimental approaches for Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂对水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化在反应器研究中的影响。但它确实讨论了铂基双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化的机理和效率：

铂基双金属催化剂通过双功能机制和电子效应增强CO氧化。第二种金属有助于在较低电位下活化水的解离,促进吸附在铂位点上的CO的氧化。它还改变了铂的电子性质,削弱了CO的吸附。

CO氧化对结构敏感,受晶面、pH值、缺陷、纳米粒子大小/形状等因素的影响。然而,该文献并未讨论未来UHV研究在将反应器结果与模型表面相关联方面的潜在见解。

该文档主要关注燃料电池中的电催化,而不是典型的多相催化反应器或UHV研究。需要进行更多研究以建立这些不同实验方法之间对铂基双金属催化剂的联系。

The literature does not provide direct information about bimetallic catalysts influencing CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversion mechanisms in reactor studies. It mostly focuses on electrocatalysis for fuel cells rather than heterogeneous catalysis in reactors. The document does mention that alloying Pt with other metals can enhance electrocatalytic performance, but this is in the context of fuel cells rather than the specified reactions. 

The literature does not discuss UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces or their potential insights. The document is focused on practical catalyst development for fuel cells rather than fundamental surface science studies.

Given the limited relevance of the provided literature to the specific question, a comprehensive answer cannot be provided based solely on this information. Further research focused specifically on bimetallic catalysts in reactor studies and UHV surface science would be needed to properly address the question.

该文献没有直接提供关于双金属催化剂影响反应器研究中CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化机理的信息。它主要集中在燃料电池的电催化方面,而不是反应器中的多相催化。文档确实提到将Pt与其他金属合金化可以提高电催化性能,但这是在燃料电池的背景下,而不是特定的反应。

文献没有讨论Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究或其潜在的见解。该文档专注于燃料电池实用催化剂的开发,而不是基础表面科学研究。

鉴于所提供的文献与具体问题的相关性有限,仅凭这些信息无法给出全面的答案。需要进一步针对反应器研究和UHV表面科学中的双金属催化剂进行研究,才能正确回答这个问题。

[2] "According to Norskov's work,96Pd was recognised to bind oxygen too firmly (more strongly than Pt) for efficient removal of the adsorbed reaction intermediates and the recovery of ORR active sites."

[3] "Recently, Jinnouchi et al. showed site-dependent dissolution potentials of Pt particles in which Pt atoms at edges, due to their higher d-band centres, dissolved more easily than Pt atoms on flat surfaces."

The literature does not directly address bimetallic catalyst mechanisms for CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, or methane conversion in reactor studies. It focuses mainly on electrocatalysis in fuel cells. However, some general principles about bimetallic catalysts can be inferred:

1. Bimetallic catalysts like PtMe (Me = other metal) can enhance catalytic activity through bifunctional mechanisms and electronic effects. The second metal can provide additional active sites or modify the electronic structure of Pt.

2. The binding strength of reactants/intermediates is crucial for catalytic activity. For example, Pd binds oxygen too strongly for efficient ORR, suggesting an optimal binding strength is needed.

3. The structure of bimetallic catalysts affects their properties. Edge sites on Pt particles have different dissolution potentials than flat surfaces due to electronic differences.

These principles likely apply to other reactions like CO oxidation or water-gas shift, though specific mechanisms would differ. UHV studies could provide atomic-level insights into how the second metal modifies Pt's electronic structure and binding properties on model surfaces, helping explain reactivity trends observed in reactor studies. However, the literature does not discuss current limitations of UHV studies on Pt bimetallics.

这篇文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂在反应器研究中对CO氧化、水气变换反应或甲烷转化的机理。它主要集中在燃料电池的电催化方面。然而,我们可以推断出一些关于双金属催化剂的一般原理:

1. 像PtMe(Me=其他金属)这样的双金属催化剂可以通过双功能机制和电子效应来增强催化活性。第二种金属可以提供额外的活性位点或修改Pt的电子结构。

2. 反应物/中间体的结合强度对催化活性至关重要。例如,Pd与氧的结合太强,不利于高效的ORR,这表明需要一个最佳的结合强度。

3. 双金属催化剂的结构影响其性质。由于电子差异,Pt颗粒的边缘位点与平面位点相比具有不同的溶解电位。

这些原理可能适用于其他反应,如CO氧化或水气变换,尽管具体机理会有所不同。UHV研究可以提供原子级的见解,说明第二种金属如何修改模型表面上Pt的电子结构和结合性质,有助于解释反应器研究中观察到的反应性趋势。然而,文献中并未讨论当前UHV研究对Pt双金属的局限性。
