[1] "According to the dual pathway mechanism proposed by Breiter and co-workers,911 the intermediate COads generated in the indirect pathway can be strongly adsorbed on the Pt surface, and the reaction active sites on the Pt become occupied, leading to a severe decrease in reaction kinetics."

[2] "In general, the bifunctional mechanism and ligand effect (electronic effect) were proposed to account for the enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of PtMe catalysts for MOR."

[3] "As for CO oxidation being a structure-sensitive reaction, considerable variables such as crystal face, solution PH, anion adsorption, defects including steps and kinks, pre-history of the electrode, and the size and shape of nanoparticles have all shown important influence on the kinetics of CO oxidation."

The literature does not directly address bimetallic catalysts' effects on water gas shift reaction or methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does discuss how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies:

Pt-based bimetallic catalysts enhance CO oxidation through bifunctional mechanisms and electronic effects. The secondary metal helps activate water dissociation at lower potentials, promoting oxidation of CO adsorbed on Pt sites. It also alters Pt's electronic properties to weaken CO adsorption.

CO oxidation is structure-sensitive, affected by factors like crystal face, pH, defects, nanoparticle size/shape. However, the literature does not discuss potential insights from future UHV studies on correlating reactor findings with model surfaces.

The document focuses on electrocatalysis in fuel cells rather than typical heterogeneous catalysis reactors or UHV studies. More research would be needed to draw connections between these different experimental approaches for Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂对水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化在反应器研究中的影响。但它确实讨论了铂基双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化的机理和效率：

铂基双金属催化剂通过双功能机制和电子效应增强CO氧化。第二种金属有助于在较低电位下活化水的解离,促进吸附在铂位点上的CO的氧化。它还改变了铂的电子性质,削弱了CO的吸附。

CO氧化对结构敏感,受晶面、pH值、缺陷、纳米粒子大小/形状等因素的影响。然而,该文献并未讨论未来UHV研究在将反应器结果与模型表面相关联方面的潜在见解。

该文档主要关注燃料电池中的电催化,而不是典型的多相催化反应器或UHV研究。需要进行更多研究以建立这些不同实验方法之间对铂基双金属催化剂的联系。
