[1] "As compared to their Pt and Co monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and allow the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures to be reduced from 1 to 103 vol %."

[2] "This effect is likely due to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface."

The literature provides limited information to fully answer the question, but it does offer some insights on bimetallic Pt-based catalysts for CO oxidation. Bimetallic Co-Pt catalysts show higher activity compared to monometallic Pt and Co catalysts in selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-containing mixtures. They are more effective at reducing CO concentration from 1% to 10^-3% by volume. This improved performance is attributed to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface.

The document does not provide information on water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. It also does not discuss UHV studies or model surfaces. Therefore, the potential insights from future UHV studies cannot be addressed based on this literature alone.

该文献提供的信息有限，无法完全回答问题，但确实对基于铂的双金属催化剂在CO氧化方面提供了一些见解。与单金属铂和钴催化剂相比，双金属钴-铂催化剂在含氢混合物中选择性CO氧化方面表现出更高的活性。它们在将CO浓度从1%降低到10^-3%（体积）方面更有效。这种性能的提高归因于在支撑表面形成了钴-铂固溶体的双金属颗粒。

文献没有提供关于水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化的信息。它也没有讨论UHV研究或模型表面。因此，仅基于这篇文献无法讨论未来UHV研究可能提供的潜在见解。
