[1] "As compared to their Pt and Co monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and allow the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures to be reduced from 1 to 103 vol %."

[2] "This effect is likely due to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface."

The literature provides limited information to fully answer the question, but it does offer some insights on bimetallic Pt-Co catalysts for CO oxidation. Bimetallic Co-Pt catalysts are reported to be more active than their monometallic counterparts in reducing CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures. This enhanced activity is attributed to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface.

The document does not provide information on water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. It also does not discuss UHV studies or their potential insights. The literature focuses primarily on CO oxidation in hydrogen-containing mixtures using Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and carbon material.

To fully address the question, additional research would be needed on the specific mechanisms of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions using various Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Furthermore, UHV studies comparing model surfaces to supported catalysts would be required to provide the correlations and insights mentioned in the question.

文献提供的信息有限，无法全面回答这个问题，但它确实对铂钴双金属催化剂用于CO氧化提供了一些见解。据报道，双金属Co-Pt催化剂在降低含氢混合物中CO浓度方面比单金属催化剂更活跃。这种增强的活性被归因于在支撑体表面形成Co-Pt固溶体的双金属颗粒。

文献没有提供关于水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化的信息。它也没有讨论UHV研究或其潜在的见解。文献主要关注使用γ-Al2O3和碳材料负载的Co-Pt双金属催化剂在含氢混合物中进行CO氧化。

要全面回答这个问题，需要对各种铂基双金属催化剂的CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的具体机理进行额外的研究。此外，还需要进行UHV研究，比较模型表面和负载催化剂，以提供问题中提到的相关性和见解。
