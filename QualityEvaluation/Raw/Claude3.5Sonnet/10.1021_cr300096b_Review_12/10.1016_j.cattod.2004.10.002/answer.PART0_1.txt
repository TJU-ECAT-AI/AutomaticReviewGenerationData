[1] "The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was shown to enhance the watergas shift (WGS) rate compared with the rate observed with Pt alone supported on either Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 at similar Pt weight loadings."

[2] "Based on this Pt dispersion, the exposed Pt surface area was calculated for Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2, Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 and Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2. The WGS rate was observed to be proportional to the exposed Pt surface area for the Pt-Re and Pt catalysts; however, the rate per m2 of exposed Pt for Pt-Re/ Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was higher than that of Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[3] "The difference in the rates upon the addition of Re to Pt WGS catalysts suggests that the role of Re in enhancing the WGS activity of Pt is more complex than to just increase the Pt dispersion."

[4] "A bifunctional redox mechanism is used to explain this synergism. In this mechanism, CO is adsorbed on the platinum, then oxygen is transferred from the ceria to the platinum, where the CO is oxidized (CO2) and the ceria is reduced (Ce4+  Ce3+); finally, the reduced ceria is reoxidized (Ce3+  Ce4+) by the dissociative adsorption of H2O, releasing H2 in the process."

[5] "If the only function of Re was to increase the Pt dispersion, one would expect the same WGS activity for both Pt and Pt-Re catalysts. We have reported an activation energy of 67 kJ/mol and reaction orders of zero for CO and 0.40 for H2O for Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2, which is in reasonable agreement with the activation energy of 46 kJ/mol and reaction orders of zero for CO and 0.5 for H2O for Pt/CeO2 reported by Bunlunsein et al., suggesting that the reaction mechanism is similar on both catalysts."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones like Pt-Re, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of the water gas shift (WGS) reaction in reactor studies. The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 enhances the WGS rate compared to Pt alone on similar supports. This enhancement is partly due to increased Pt dispersion, as the WGS rate is proportional to the exposed Pt surface area. However, the rate per m2 of exposed Pt is higher for Pt-Re catalysts than for Pt alone, suggesting that Re's role is more complex than just increasing Pt dispersion.

The mechanism for the WGS reaction on these catalysts is believed to be a bifunctional redox mechanism, where CO adsorbs on Pt, oxygen transfers from the ceria support to Pt for CO oxidation, and the reduced ceria is then reoxidized by water, releasing hydrogen. The similar activation energies and reaction orders for Pt and Pt-Re catalysts suggest that the basic reaction mechanism remains similar, but with enhanced efficiency for the Pt-Re system.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by allowing detailed investigation of the surface interactions between Pt and Re atoms, as well as their interactions with reactant molecules like CO and H2O. This could help elucidate the exact nature of the synergistic effect between Pt and Re, which is not fully understood from reactor studies alone. UHV studies could also provide information on the electronic effects of Re on Pt, which might explain the enhanced activity per exposed Pt site.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, particularly the complexity of creating well-defined bimetallic surfaces and the pressure gap between UHV and realistic reaction conditions, present challenges. Overcoming these limitations could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the structure-activity relationships in these bimetallic catalysts, potentially bridging the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts used in practical applications.

双金属催化剂，尤其是以铂为基础的催化剂（如铂-铼），在反应器研究中显著影响水气变换（WGS）反应的机理和效率。将铼添加到Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2中可以提高WGS反应速率，相比于在类似载体上单独使用铂。这种增强部分是由于铂分散度的提高，因为WGS反应速率与暴露的铂表面积成正比。然而，铂-铼催化剂的每平方米暴露铂表面的反应速率高于单独使用铂的催化剂，这表明铼的作用比仅仅增加铂分散度更为复杂。

这些催化剂上WGS反应的机理被认为是一种双功能氧化还原机制，其中CO吸附在铂上，氧从氧化铈载体转移到铂上进行CO氧化，然后还原的氧化铈被水重新氧化，释放出氢气。铂和铂-铼催化剂的类似活化能和反应级数表明，基本反应机理保持相似，但铂-铼体系的效率更高。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供宝贵的见解，通过允许详细研究铂和铼原子之间的表面相互作用，以及它们与CO和H2O等反应物分子的相互作用。这可能有助于阐明铂和铼之间协同效应的确切本质，这仅从反应器研究中无法完全理解。UHV研究还可以提供关于铼对铂的电子效应的信息，这可能解释了每个暴露铂位点的活性增强。

然而，目前UHV研究在铂基双金属表面上的限制，特别是创建明确定义的双金属表面的复杂性以及UHV和实际反应条件之间的压力差，带来了挑战。克服这些限制可能会导致对这些双金属催化剂的结构-活性关系有更全面的理解，潜在地弥合模型表面和实际应用中使用的负载型催化剂之间的差距。
