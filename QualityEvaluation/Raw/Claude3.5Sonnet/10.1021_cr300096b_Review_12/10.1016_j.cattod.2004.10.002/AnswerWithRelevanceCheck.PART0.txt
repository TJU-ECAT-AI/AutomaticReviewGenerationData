          [1] "The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was shown to enhance the watergas shift (WGS) rate compared with the rate observed with Pt alone supported on either Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 at similar Pt weight loadings."

[2] "The results from CO chemisorption showed that the Pt was more highly dispersed on Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 than on the Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[3] "The WGS rate was observed to be proportional to the exposed Pt surface area for the Pt-Re and Pt catalysts; however, the rate per m2 of exposed Pt for Pt-Re/ Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was higher than that of Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[4] "The difference in the rates upon the addition of Re to Pt WGS catalysts suggests that the role of Re in enhancing the WGS activity of Pt is more complex than to just increase the Pt dispersion."

[5] "If the only function of Re was to increase the Pt dispersion, one would expect the same WGS activity for both Pt and Pt-Re catalysts."

[6] "A bifunctional redox mechanism is used to explain this synergism. In this mechanism, CO is adsorbed on the platinum, then oxygen is transferred from the ceria to the platinum, where the CO is oxidized (CO2) and the ceria is reduced (Ce4+  Ce3+); finally, the reduced ceria is reoxidized (Ce3+  Ce4+) by the dissociative adsorption of H2O, releasing H2 in the process."

          Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones like Pt-Re, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of the water gas shift (WGS) reaction in reactor studies. The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 enhances the WGS rate compared to Pt alone on similar supports. This enhancement is partly due to increased Pt dispersion, as shown by CO chemisorption studies. However, the effect goes beyond just improved dispersion, as the rate per unit of exposed Pt surface area is higher for Pt-Re catalysts than for Pt alone.

The mechanism for the WGS reaction on these catalysts is believed to be a bifunctional redox mechanism, where CO adsorbs on Pt, oxygen transfers from the ceria support to Pt for CO oxidation, and the reduced ceria is then reoxidized by water, releasing hydrogen.

The synergistic effect between Pt and Re suggests possible electronic or structural modifications that affect the catalytic properties. The role of Re in enhancing the WGS activity of Pt is more complex than simply increasing Pt dispersion.

Current reactor studies provide valuable insights into the performance of these bimetallic catalysts, but they have limitations in elucidating the precise nature of the active sites and reaction mechanisms at the atomic scale. Future UHV studies on model Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could potentially bridge this gap by allowing detailed investigation of surface structures, adsorption properties, and reaction intermediates under well-controlled conditions.

Such UHV studies could help correlate the findings from reactor studies with atomic-scale phenomena on model surfaces and supported catalysts. They could provide insights into how the addition of Re modifies the electronic structure of Pt, affects the adsorption and activation of reactants, and influences the formation and stability of reaction intermediates. This information could be crucial for understanding the observed synergistic effects and for rational design of more efficient bimetallic catalysts.

However, it's important to note that there are current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, particularly in replicating the complex environment of supported catalysts under reaction conditions. Bridging the gap between UHV studies and real catalytic systems remains a significant challenge in the field.

          双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的催化剂如铂-铼，在反应器研究中显著影响水气转化（WGS）反应的机理和效率。与单独的Pt催化剂相比，在相似支撑体上添加Re可以提高WGS反应速率。CO化学吸附研究表明，这种增强部分归因于Pt分散度的提高。然而，这种效果不仅仅是分散度改善，因为Pt-Re催化剂的单位暴露Pt表面积反应速率高于单独的Pt催化剂。

这些催化剂上WGS反应的机理被认为是一种双功能氧化还原机制，其中CO吸附在铂上，氧从氧化铈载体转移到铂上进行CO氧化，然后还原的氧化铈被水重新氧化，释放出氢气。

Pt和Re之间的协同效应暗示可能存在影响催化性能的电子或结构修饰。Re在增强Pt的WGS活性中的作用比单纯增加Pt分散度更为复杂。

当前的反应器研究为这些双金属催化剂的性能提供了宝贵的见解，但在阐明原子尺度上活性位点和反应机理的精确本质方面存在局限性。未来在模型Pt基双金属表面上进行的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会弥补这一差距，允许在严格控制的条件下详细研究表面结构、吸附性质和反应中间体。

这些UHV研究可以帮助将反应器研究的发现与模型表面和负载催化剂上的原子尺度现象相关联。它们可以提供关于Re的添加如何修改Pt的电子结构、影响反应物的吸附和活化以及影响反应中间体的形成和稳定性的见解。这些信息对于理解观察到的协同效应和理性设计更高效的双金属催化剂至关重要。

然而，值得注意的是，在Pt基双金属表面上进行UHV研究目前存在一些限制，特别是在复制反应条件下负载催化剂的复杂环境方面。在UHV研究和实际催化系统之间架起桥梁仍然是该领域的一个重大挑战。
