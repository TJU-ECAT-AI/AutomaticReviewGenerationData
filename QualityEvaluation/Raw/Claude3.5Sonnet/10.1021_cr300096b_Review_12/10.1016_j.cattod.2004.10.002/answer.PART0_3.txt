[1] "The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was shown to enhance the watergas shift (WGS) rate compared with the rate observed with Pt alone supported on either Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 at similar Pt weight loadings."

[2] "The results from CO chemisorption showed that the Pt was more highly dispersed on Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 than on the Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[3] "The WGS rate was observed to be proportional to the exposed Pt surface area for the Pt-Re and Pt catalysts; however, the rate per m2 of exposed Pt for Pt-Re/ Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was higher than that of Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[4] "The difference in the rates upon the addition of Re to Pt WGS catalysts suggests that the role of Re in enhancing the WGS activity of Pt is more complex than to just increase the Pt dispersion."

[5] "If the only function of Re was to increase the Pt dispersion, one would expect the same WGS activity for both Pt and Pt-Re catalysts."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones like Pt-Re, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of the water gas shift (WGS) reaction. The addition of Re to Pt catalysts enhances the WGS rate compared to Pt alone on similar supports. This enhancement is partly due to increased Pt dispersion, as shown by CO chemisorption studies. However, the effect of Re goes beyond just improving Pt dispersion.

The WGS rate is proportional to the exposed Pt surface area for both Pt and Pt-Re catalysts. Interestingly, the rate per m2 of exposed Pt is higher for Pt-Re catalysts than for Pt alone, suggesting a synergistic effect between Pt and Re. This indicates that the role of Re in enhancing WGS activity is more complex than simply increasing Pt dispersion.

The literature does not provide specific information on CO oxidation or methane conversion reactions for these catalysts. Additionally, there is no mention of UHV studies or their potential insights in correlating reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide valuable insights into the nature of the Pt-Re interaction on model surfaces, helping to elucidate the mechanisms behind the enhanced activity observed in reactor studies. Such studies could investigate the electronic and structural properties of Pt-Re surfaces, adsorption and reaction intermediates, and how these properties correlate with the observed catalytic behavior in supported catalysts. This could lead to a better understanding of the synergistic effects between Pt and Re and guide the design of more efficient bimetallic catalysts for WGS and potentially other reactions.

双金属催化剂，尤其是基于铂的催化剂如铂-铼，显著影响水气变换(WGS)反应的机理和效率。将铼添加到铂催化剂中可以增强WGS反应速率，相比于在相似载体上的单一铂催化剂。这种增强部分是由于铂的分散度提高，这一点通过CO化学吸附研究得到证实。然而，铼的作用不仅仅是提高铂的分散度。

对于铂和铂-铼催化剂，WGS反应速率与暴露的铂表面积成正比。有趣的是，铂-铼催化剂的单位暴露铂表面积反应速率高于单一铂催化剂，这表明铂和铼之间存在协同效应。这说明铼在增强WGS活性中的作用比单纯增加铂分散度更为复杂。

文献中没有提供这些催化剂在CO氧化或甲烷转化反应方面的具体信息。此外，也没有提到超高真空(UHV)研究或其在将反应器研究与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联方面的潜在见解。

未来的UHV研究可能会为理解模型表面上铂-铼相互作用的本质提供宝贵的见解，有助于阐明反应器研究中观察到的增强活性背后的机制。这些研究可以探究铂-铼表面的电子和结构特性、吸附和反应中间体，以及这些特性如何与负载型催化剂中观察到的催化行为相关联。这可能会带来对铂和铼之间协同效应的更好理解，并指导设计更高效的双金属催化剂，用于WGS反应和潜在的其他反应。
