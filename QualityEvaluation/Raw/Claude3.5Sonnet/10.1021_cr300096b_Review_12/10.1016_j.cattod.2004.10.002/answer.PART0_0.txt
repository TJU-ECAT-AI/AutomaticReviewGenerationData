[1] "The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was shown to enhance the watergas shift (WGS) rate compared with the rate observed with Pt alone supported on either Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 at similar Pt weight loadings."

[2] "The results from CO chemisorption showed that the Pt was more highly dispersed on Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 than on the Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[3] "The WGS rate was observed to be proportional to the exposed Pt surface area for the Pt-Re and Pt catalysts; however, the rate per m2 of exposed Pt for Pt-Re/ Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was higher than that of Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[4] "The difference in the rates upon the addition of Re to Pt WGS catalysts suggests that the role of Re in enhancing the WGS activity of Pt is more complex than to just increase the Pt dispersion."

[5] "If the only function of Re was to increase the Pt dispersion, one would expect the same WGS activity for both Pt and Pt-Re catalysts."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones like Pt-Re, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of water gas shift (WGS) reactions in reactor studies. The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 enhances the WGS rate compared to Pt alone on similar supports. This enhancement is partially due to increased Pt dispersion, as shown by CO chemisorption studies. However, the higher WGS rate per m2 of exposed Pt for Pt-Re catalysts suggests that Re's role goes beyond just increasing Pt dispersion.

The mechanism by which Re promotes Pt's WGS activity is not fully understood, indicating a complex interaction between the two metals. This complexity suggests that future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by allowing detailed investigation of the surface chemistry and interactions between Pt and Re on model surfaces. Such studies could help correlate the findings from reactor studies with supported catalysts and provide a more fundamental understanding of the synergistic effects in Pt-Re bimetallic catalysts.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may present challenges in directly correlating these findings. UHV studies on model surfaces might not fully capture the complexities of supported catalysts under reaction conditions, including support effects and dynamic changes during the reaction. Nevertheless, they could offer crucial information on the electronic and structural properties of Pt-Re surfaces, potentially explaining the observed enhancement in WGS activity and stability.

Future UHV studies could focus on investigating the nature of Pt-Re interactions, the role of Re in modifying Pt's electronic properties, and how these factors affect the adsorption and activation of reactants in the WGS reaction. This could provide a bridge between the macroscopic observations in reactor studies and the atomic-scale processes occurring on the catalyst surface.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂如Pt-Re，在反应器研究中显著影响了水煤气变换（WGS）反应的机理和效率。将Re添加到Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2中，与类似载体上的单一Pt相比，可以提高WGS反应速率。这种增强部分归因于Pt分散度的提高，这一点通过CO化学吸附研究得到证实。然而，Pt-Re催化剂每平方米暴露Pt的更高WGS反应速率表明，Re的作用不仅仅是增加Pt的分散度。

Re促进Pt的WGS活性的机理尚未完全理解，这表明两种金属之间存在复杂的相互作用。这种复杂性意味着未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供宝贵的见解，通过允许详细研究模型表面上Pt和Re之间的表面化学和相互作用。这些研究可以帮助将反应器研究中的发现与负载型催化剂相关联，并提供对Pt-Re双金属催化剂中协同效应的更基本理解。

然而，当前UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的局限性可能会在直接关联这些发现方面带来挑战。在模型表面上进行的UHV研究可能无法完全捕捉到反应条件下负载型催化剂的复杂性，包括载体效应和反应过程中的动态变化。尽管如此，它们可以提供关于Pt-Re表面电子和结构性质的关键信息，可能解释观察到的WGS活性和稳定性的增强。

未来的UHV研究可以集中于研究Pt-Re相互作用的本质，Re在修改Pt电子性质中的作用，以及这些因素如何影响WGS反应中反应物的吸附和活化。这可以为反应器研究中的宏观观察和催化剂表面上发生的原子尺度过程之间提供一个桥梁。
