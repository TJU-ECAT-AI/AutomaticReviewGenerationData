[1] "The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was shown to enhance the watergas shift (WGS) rate compared with the rate observed with Pt alone supported on either Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 at similar Pt weight loadings."

[2] "The results from CO chemisorption showed that the Pt was more highly dispersed on Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 than on the Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[3] "The WGS rate was observed to be proportional to the exposed Pt surface area for the Pt-Re and Pt catalysts; however, the rate per m2 of exposed Pt for Pt-Re/ Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was higher than that of Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[4] "The difference in the rates upon the addition of Re to Pt WGS catalysts suggests that the role of Re in enhancing the WGS activity of Pt is more complex than to just increase the Pt dispersion."

[5] "If the only function of Re was to increase the Pt dispersion, one would expect the same WGS activity for both Pt and Pt-Re catalysts."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones like Pt-Re, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of water gas shift (WGS) reactions in reactor studies. The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 enhances the WGS rate compared to Pt alone on similar supports. This enhancement is partially due to increased Pt dispersion, as shown by CO chemisorption studies. However, the higher WGS rate per m2 of exposed Pt for Pt-Re catalysts suggests that Re's role goes beyond just increasing Pt dispersion.

The mechanism by which Re promotes Pt's WGS activity is not fully understood, indicating a complex interaction between the two metals. This complexity suggests that future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by allowing detailed investigation of the surface chemistry and interactions between Pt and Re on model surfaces. Such studies could help correlate the findings from reactor studies with supported catalysts and provide a more fundamental understanding of the synergistic effects in Pt-Re bimetallic catalysts.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may present challenges in directly correlating these findings. UHV studies on model surfaces might not fully capture the complexities of supported catalysts under reaction conditions, including support effects and dynamic changes during the reaction. Nevertheless, they could offer crucial information on the electronic and structural properties of Pt-Re surfaces, potentially explaining the observed enhancement in WGS activity and stability.

Future UHV studies could focus on investigating the nature of Pt-Re interactions, the role of Re in modifying Pt's electronic properties, and how these factors affect the adsorption and activation of reactants in the WGS reaction. This could provide a bridge between the macroscopic observations in reactor studies and the atomic-scale processes occurring on the catalyst surface.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂如Pt-Re，在反应器研究中显著影响了水煤气变换（WGS）反应的机理和效率。将Re添加到Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2中，与类似载体上的单一Pt相比，可以提高WGS反应速率。这种增强部分归因于Pt分散度的提高，这一点通过CO化学吸附研究得到证实。然而，Pt-Re催化剂每平方米暴露Pt的更高WGS反应速率表明，Re的作用不仅仅是增加Pt的分散度。

Re促进Pt的WGS活性的机理尚未完全理解，这表明两种金属之间存在复杂的相互作用。这种复杂性意味着未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供宝贵的见解，通过允许详细研究模型表面上Pt和Re之间的表面化学和相互作用。这些研究可以帮助将反应器研究中的发现与负载型催化剂相关联，并提供对Pt-Re双金属催化剂中协同效应的更基本理解。

然而，当前UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的局限性可能会在直接关联这些发现方面带来挑战。在模型表面上进行的UHV研究可能无法完全捕捉到反应条件下负载型催化剂的复杂性，包括载体效应和反应过程中的动态变化。尽管如此，它们可以提供关于Pt-Re表面电子和结构性质的关键信息，可能解释观察到的WGS活性和稳定性的增强。

未来的UHV研究可以集中于研究Pt-Re相互作用的本质，Re在修改Pt电子性质中的作用，以及这些因素如何影响WGS反应中反应物的吸附和活化。这可以为反应器研究中的宏观观察和催化剂表面上发生的原子尺度过程之间提供一个桥梁。

[2] "Based on this Pt dispersion, the exposed Pt surface area was calculated for Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2, Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 and Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2. The WGS rate was observed to be proportional to the exposed Pt surface area for the Pt-Re and Pt catalysts; however, the rate per m2 of exposed Pt for Pt-Re/ Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was higher than that of Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[4] "A bifunctional redox mechanism is used to explain this synergism. In this mechanism, CO is adsorbed on the platinum, then oxygen is transferred from the ceria to the platinum, where the CO is oxidized (CO2) and the ceria is reduced (Ce4+  Ce3+); finally, the reduced ceria is reoxidized (Ce3+  Ce4+) by the dissociative adsorption of H2O, releasing H2 in the process."

[5] "If the only function of Re was to increase the Pt dispersion, one would expect the same WGS activity for both Pt and Pt-Re catalysts. We have reported an activation energy of 67 kJ/mol and reaction orders of zero for CO and 0.40 for H2O for Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2, which is in reasonable agreement with the activation energy of 46 kJ/mol and reaction orders of zero for CO and 0.5 for H2O for Pt/CeO2 reported by Bunlunsein et al., suggesting that the reaction mechanism is similar on both catalysts."

However, the rate per m2 of exposed Pt is higher for Pt-Re catalysts than for Pt alone, suggesting that Re's role is more complex than just increasing Pt dispersion.

The mechanism for the WGS reaction on these catalysts is believed to be a bifunctional redox mechanism, where CO adsorbs on Pt, oxygen transfers from the ceria support to Pt for CO oxidation, and the reduced ceria is then reoxidized by water, releasing hydrogen. The similar activation energies and reaction orders for Pt and Pt-Re catalysts suggest that the basic reaction mechanism remains similar, but with enhanced efficiency for the Pt-Re system.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by allowing detailed investigation of the surface interactions between Pt and Re atoms, as well as their interactions with reactant molecules like CO and H2O. This could help elucidate the exact nature of the synergistic effect between Pt and Re, which is not fully understood from reactor studies alone. UHV studies could also provide information on the electronic effects of Re on Pt, which might explain the enhanced activity per exposed Pt site.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, particularly the complexity of creating well-defined bimetallic surfaces and the pressure gap between UHV and realistic reaction conditions, present challenges. Overcoming these limitations could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the structure-activity relationships in these bimetallic catalysts, potentially bridging the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts used in practical applications.

双金属催化剂，尤其是以铂为基础的催化剂（如铂-铼），在反应器研究中显著影响水气变换（WGS）反应的机理和效率。将铼添加到Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2中可以提高WGS反应速率，相比于在类似载体上单独使用铂。这种增强部分是由于铂分散度的提高，因为WGS反应速率与暴露的铂表面积成正比。然而，铂-铼催化剂的每平方米暴露铂表面的反应速率高于单独使用铂的催化剂，这表明铼的作用比仅仅增加铂分散度更为复杂。

这些催化剂上WGS反应的机理被认为是一种双功能氧化还原机制，其中CO吸附在铂上，氧从氧化铈载体转移到铂上进行CO氧化，然后还原的氧化铈被水重新氧化，释放出氢气。铂和铂-铼催化剂的类似活化能和反应级数表明，基本反应机理保持相似，但铂-铼体系的效率更高。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供宝贵的见解，通过允许详细研究铂和铼原子之间的表面相互作用，以及它们与CO和H2O等反应物分子的相互作用。这可能有助于阐明铂和铼之间协同效应的确切本质，这仅从反应器研究中无法完全理解。UHV研究还可以提供关于铼对铂的电子效应的信息，这可能解释了每个暴露铂位点的活性增强。

然而，目前UHV研究在铂基双金属表面上的限制，特别是创建明确定义的双金属表面的复杂性以及UHV和实际反应条件之间的压力差，带来了挑战。克服这些限制可能会导致对这些双金属催化剂的结构-活性关系有更全面的理解，潜在地弥合模型表面和实际应用中使用的负载型催化剂之间的差距。

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones like Pt-Re, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of water gas shift (WGS) reactions in reactor studies. The addition of Re to Pt catalysts enhances the WGS rate compared to Pt alone on similar supports. This enhancement is partly due to increased Pt dispersion, as shown by CO chemisorption studies. However, the effect goes beyond just improved dispersion, as the rate per unit of exposed Pt surface area is higher for Pt-Re catalysts than for Pt alone.

The mechanism by which Re promotes Pt activity is not fully understood, but it appears to be more complex than simply increasing Pt dispersion. The synergistic effect between Pt and Re suggests possible electronic or structural modifications that affect the catalytic properties.

Current reactor studies provide valuable insights into the performance of these bimetallic catalysts, but they have limitations in elucidating the precise nature of the active sites and reaction mechanisms at the atomic scale. Future UHV studies on model Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could potentially bridge this gap by allowing detailed investigation of surface structures, adsorption properties, and reaction intermediates under well-controlled conditions.

Such UHV studies could help correlate the findings from reactor studies with atomic-scale phenomena on model surfaces and supported catalysts. They could provide insights into how the addition of Re modifies the electronic structure of Pt, affects the adsorption and activation of reactants, and influences the formation and stability of reaction intermediates. This information could be crucial for understanding the observed synergistic effects and for rational design of more efficient bimetallic catalysts.

However, it's important to note that there are current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, particularly in replicating the complex environment of supported catalysts under reaction conditions. Bridging the gap between UHV studies and real catalytic systems remains a significant challenge in the field.

Re促进Pt活性的机理尚未完全理解，但似乎比仅仅增加Pt分散度更为复杂。Pt和Re之间的协同效应暗示可能存在影响催化性能的电子或结构修饰。

当前的反应器研究为这些双金属催化剂的性能提供了宝贵的见解，但在阐明原子尺度上活性位点和反应机理的精确本质方面存在局限性。未来在模型Pt基双金属表面上进行的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会弥补这一差距，允许在严格控制的条件下详细研究表面结构、吸附性质和反应中间体。

这些UHV研究可以帮助将反应器研究的发现与模型表面和负载催化剂上的原子尺度现象相关联。它们可以提供关于Re的添加如何修改Pt的电子结构、影响反应物的吸附和活化以及影响反应中间体的形成和稳定性的见解。这些信息对于理解观察到的协同效应和理性设计更高效的双金属催化剂至关重要。

然而，值得注意的是，在Pt基双金属表面上进行UHV研究目前存在一些限制，特别是在复制反应条件下负载催化剂的复杂环境方面。在UHV研究和实际催化系统之间架起桥梁仍然是该领域的一个重大挑战。

Such studies could also investigate the effect of Re on the stability of Pt particles, as the literature suggests that Re may inhibit Pt sintering. Additionally, UHV studies could provide atomic-level insights into how Re affects the adsorption and activation of reactants like CO and H2O on the catalyst surface, which could explain the observed enhancement in WGS activity.
