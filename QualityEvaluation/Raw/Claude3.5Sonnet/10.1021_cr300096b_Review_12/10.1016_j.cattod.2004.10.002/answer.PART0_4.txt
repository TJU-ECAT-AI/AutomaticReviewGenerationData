[1] "The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was shown to enhance the watergas shift (WGS) rate compared with the rate observed with Pt alone supported on either Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 at similar Pt weight loadings."

[2] "The results from CO chemisorption showed that the Pt was more highly dispersed on Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 than on the Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[3] "The WGS rate was observed to be proportional to the exposed Pt surface area for the Pt-Re and Pt catalysts; however, the rate per m2 of exposed Pt for Pt-Re/ Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 was higher than that of Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 or Pt/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2."

[4] "The difference in the rates upon the addition of Re to Pt WGS catalysts suggests that the role of Re in enhancing the WGS activity of Pt is more complex than to just increase the Pt dispersion."

[5] "If the only function of Re was to increase the Pt dispersion, one would expect the same WGS activity for both Pt and Pt-Re catalysts."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones like Pt-Re, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of the water gas shift (WGS) reaction. The addition of Re to Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 enhances the WGS rate compared to Pt alone on similar supports. This enhancement is partly due to increased Pt dispersion, as shown by CO chemisorption studies. However, the role of Re is more complex than simply increasing Pt dispersion.

The WGS rate is proportional to the exposed Pt surface area for both Pt and Pt-Re catalysts. Interestingly, the rate per m2 of exposed Pt is higher for Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2 than for Pt alone, suggesting a synergistic effect between Pt and Re beyond just increased dispersion.

Current UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are limited. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into the nature of the Pt-Re interaction, such as whether a PtRe alloy forms, and how this affects the catalyst's electronic structure and reactivity. These studies could help correlate findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially elucidating the mechanism behind the enhanced activity of Pt-Re catalysts in the WGS reaction.

Such studies could also investigate the effect of Re on the stability of Pt particles, as the literature suggests that Re may inhibit Pt sintering. Additionally, UHV studies could provide atomic-level insights into how Re affects the adsorption and activation of reactants like CO and H2O on the catalyst surface, which could explain the observed enhancement in WGS activity.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂如Pt-Re，显著影响水气变换(WGS)反应的机理和效率。将Re添加到Pt/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2中，与在类似载体上单独使用Pt相比，可以提高WGS反应速率。CO化学吸附研究表明，这种增强部分是由于Pt分散度的提高。然而，Re的作用比仅仅增加Pt分散度更为复杂。

对于Pt和Pt-Re催化剂，WGS反应速率与暴露的Pt表面积成正比。有趣的是，Pt-Re/Ce0.46Zr0.54O2的单位面积Pt反应速率高于单独的Pt，这表明Pt和Re之间存在协同效应，不仅仅是增加分散度。

目前对基于Pt的双金属表面的超高真空(UHV)研究还很有限。未来的UHV研究可能会为Pt-Re相互作用的本质提供洞见，例如是否形成PtRe合金，以及这如何影响催化剂的电子结构和反应活性。这些研究可以帮助将反应器研究的发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联，可能阐明Pt-Re催化剂在WGS反应中活性增强的机理。

这些研究还可以调查Re对Pt颗粒稳定性的影响，因为文献表明Re可能抑制Pt的烧结。此外，UHV研究可以提供原子级别的洞察，了解Re如何影响CO和H2O等反应物在催化剂表面的吸附和活化，这可以解释观察到的WGS活性增强现象。
