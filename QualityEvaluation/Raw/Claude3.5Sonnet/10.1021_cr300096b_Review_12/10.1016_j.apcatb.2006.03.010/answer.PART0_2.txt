The literature provides some insights on how bimetallic PdPt catalysts influence methane conversion mechanisms and efficiencies compared to monometallic Pd catalysts:

PdPt bimetallic catalysts show significantly more stable methane conversion than monometallic Pd catalysts across different support materials. The addition of Pt helps prevent the drop in methane conversion observed with Pd-only catalysts over time.

The support material affects the performance of PdPt catalysts. PdPt on ceria-stabilized zirconia (PdPtCeZrO2) was found to be the most active for methane conversion above 620°C in steady-state conditions. 

ZrO2-based supports helped suppress the drop in methane conversion during PdO decomposition compared to Al2O3 supports for the PdPt catalysts.

However, the literature does not provide information on CO oxidation or water-gas shift reactions for these catalysts. It also does not discuss potential insights from UHV studies or correlations with model surfaces. The focus is primarily on methane conversion in reactor studies using supported PdPt catalysts. Future UHV studies examining Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could potentially provide molecular-level insights into the enhanced stability and activity observed in the reactor studies, but this connection is not made in the given literature.

这篇文献为我们提供了一些关于双金属PdPt催化剂如何影响甲烷转化机理和效率的见解,与单金属Pd催化剂相比:

PdPt双金属催化剂在不同支撑材料上表现出明显更稳定的甲烷转化能力,比单金属Pd催化剂更稳定。添加Pt有助于防止单一Pd催化剂随时间推移出现的甲烷转化率下降现象。

支撑材料会影响PdPt催化剂的性能。在稳态条件下,铈稳定的氧化锆负载的PdPt催化剂(PdPtCeZrO2)在620°C以上温度下表现出最高的甲烷转化活性。

与Al2O3支撑相比,ZrO2基支撑材料有助于抑制PdPt催化剂在PdO分解过程中甲烷转化率的下降。

然而,这篇文献并未提供这些催化剂在CO氧化或水煤气变换反应方面的信息。它也没有讨论超高真空(UHV)研究的潜在见解或与模型表面的相关性。文献主要关注使用负载型PdPt催化剂在反应器研究中的甲烷转化。未来针对Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究可能会为反应器研究中观察到的增强稳定性和活性提供分子水平的见解,但这种联系在给定的文献中并未提及。
