The literature provides some insights into how bimetallic PdPt catalysts influence methane conversion:

1. Bimetallic PdPt catalysts behave differently from monometallic Pd or Pt catalysts in methane combustion.

2. Adding Pt to Pd catalysts improves stability and prevents decreases in methane conversion over time.

3. Support materials affect catalyst performance. PdPtCeZrO2 showed the highest activity above 620°C in steady-state tests.

4. PdPtCeZrO2 facilitates easier reoxidation of Pd during cooling.

However, the literature does not provide information on CO oxidation or water-gas shift reactions for these catalysts. It also does not discuss UHV studies or correlations with model surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially provide atomic-level insights into the surface chemistry and structures of PdPt bimetallic catalysts, which could help explain the improved performance and stability observed in reactor studies. Such studies could examine how factors like metal ratio, particle size, and support interactions influence catalytic behavior at the molecular level.

该文献提供了一些关于双金属PdPt催化剂如何影响甲烷转化的见解：

1. 双金属PdPt催化剂在甲烷燃烧中的行为与单金属Pd或Pt催化剂不同。

2. 向Pd催化剂中添加Pt可以提高稳定性，防止甲烷转化率随时间降低。

3. 载体材料影响催化剂性能。在稳态测试中，PdPtCeZrO2在620°C以上显示出最高的活性。

4. PdPtCeZrO2在冷却过程中可以更容易地促进Pd的再氧化。

然而，该文献没有提供这些催化剂在CO氧化或水煤气变换反应方面的信息。它也没有讨论UHV研究或与模型表面的相关性。未来的UHV研究可能会提供PdPt双金属催化剂表面化学和结构的原子级见解，这可能有助于解释在反应器研究中观察到的性能和稳定性的改善。这些研究可以研究金属比例、粒子大小和载体相互作用等因素如何在分子水平上影响催化行为。
