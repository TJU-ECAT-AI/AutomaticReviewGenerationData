The literature provides some insights into how bimetallic PdPt catalysts influence methane conversion compared to monometallic Pd catalysts. PdPt catalysts show more stable methane conversion than Pd alone, regardless of the support material used. The bimetallic catalysts had a 2:1 Pd:Pt ratio. PdPtCeZrO2 was found to be the most active bimetallic catalyst at temperatures above 620°C in steady-state tests. The activity of PdPt catalysts increased over time, likely due to PdO formation during operation.

However, the literature does not provide information specifically on CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions for Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. It also does not discuss UHV studies or correlations between reactor studies and model surfaces. The document focuses mainly on methane conversion over PdPt catalysts with different supports, rather than addressing the full scope of the question about various reactions and UHV studies on Pt bimetallics.

该文献提供了一些关于双金属PdPt催化剂如何影响甲烷转化的见解,与单金属Pd催化剂相比。PdPt催化剂表现出比单独的Pd更稳定的甲烷转化,不论使用何种载体材料。双金属催化剂的Pd:Pt比例为2:1。在稳态测试中,PdPtCeZrO2被发现在620°C以上温度下是最活跃的双金属催化剂。PdPt催化剂的活性随时间增加,可能是由于运行过程中PdO的形成。

然而,该文献并未提供关于Pt基双金属催化剂的CO氧化或水煤气变换反应的具体信息。它也没有讨论UHV研究或反应器研究与模型表面之间的相关性。该文档主要集中在不同载体上PdPt催化剂的甲烷转化,而不是涉及关于各种反应和Pt双金属UHV研究的完整问题范围。
