[1] "A series of PtNi bimetallic catalysts supported on δ-Al2O3 to be used in carbon dioxide reforming of methane was prepared and tested with the objective of optimizing the Ni/Pt metal composition to obtain high activity and stability."

[2] "The activity results showed that the catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples strongly depended on the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio."

[3] "The combined characterization and catalyst performance tests results reveal that low Ni/Pt molar loading ratio of 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 sample led to a relatively easy reduction of nickel oxide species and smaller nano-sized nickel particles having better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites in the closed vicinity."

[4] "The results of the combined dry reforming and partial oxidation tests strongly indicated a change in surface reaction mechanism depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts."

The literature provides insights into how PtNi bimetallic catalysts influence methane conversion mechanisms and efficiencies in CO2 reforming of methane. It shows that the catalytic performance of PtNi catalysts is strongly dependent on metal loadings and the Ni/Pt ratio. A low Ni/Pt ratio led to easier reduction of nickel oxide species and formation of smaller, well-dispersed nickel nanoparticles due to interactions between Pt and Ni sites. The study also indicates that the surface reaction mechanism changes based on Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio.

However, the literature does not specifically address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. It also does not discuss UHV studies or their potential insights. The study focuses on reactor studies of supported catalysts rather than model surfaces. Therefore, the question about correlating findings with model surfaces and UHV studies cannot be directly answered based on this literature.

To fully address the question, additional research would be needed on CO oxidation and water gas shift reactions with Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, as well as UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and their correlation with supported catalyst studies.

该文献提供了关于PtNi双金属催化剂如何影响甲烷转化机理和效率的见解，特别是在甲烷的二氧化碳重整反应中。研究表明，PtNi催化剂的催化性能强烈依赖于金属负载量和Ni/Pt比例。低Ni/Pt比例导致氧化镍物种更容易还原，并形成更小、分散性更好的镍纳米颗粒，这是由于Pt和Ni位点之间的相互作用。研究还指出，表面反应机理会根据Pt负载量和Ni/Pt比例而改变。

然而，该文献并未具体讨论CO氧化或水气变换反应。它也没有涉及超高真空（UHV）研究或其潜在见解。这项研究主要集中在负载型催化剂的反应器研究，而非模型表面。因此，基于这篇文献无法直接回答关于将研究结果与模型表面和UHV研究相关联的问题。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要对Pt基双金属催化剂的CO氧化和水气变换反应进行额外研究，以及对Pt基双金属表面进行UHV研究，并将其与负载型催化剂研究相关联。
