[1] "A series of PtNi bimetallic catalysts supported on δ-Al2O3 to be used in carbon dioxide reforming of methane was prepared and tested with the objective of optimizing the Ni/Pt metal composition to obtain high activity and stability."

[2] "The activity results showed that the catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples strongly depended on the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio."

[3] "Among all the catalysts, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, which has the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability."

[4] "The combined characterization and catalyst performance tests results reveal that low Ni/Pt molar loading ratio of 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 sample led to a relatively easy reduction of nickel oxide species and smaller nano-sized nickel particles having better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites in the closed vicinity."

[5] "The changes in the catalysts activity and stability under the presence of an additional oxygen source were determined through addition of small amounts of either oxygen or water vapor to the feed stream."

[6] "The results of the combined dry reforming and partial oxidation tests strongly indicated a change in surface reaction mechanism depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts."

The literature primarily focuses on PtNi bimetallic catalysts for carbon dioxide reforming of methane, rather than specifically addressing CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. However, it provides insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence reaction mechanisms and efficiencies in reactor studies.

The study shows that the catalytic performance of PtNi bimetallic catalysts strongly depends on metal loadings and the Ni/Pt loading ratio. The catalyst with the lowest Ni/Pt ratio (0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3) exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability. This is attributed to easier reduction of nickel oxide species and formation of smaller, better-dispersed nickel nanoparticles due to intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites.

The research also investigated the effects of adding oxygen or water vapor to the feed stream, which led to changes in catalyst activity and stability. The results indicated that the surface reaction mechanism changed depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts.

While the study doesn't directly address UHV studies, it suggests that future UHV research could provide valuable insights by examining how the Pt-Ni interaction and particle size affect surface reactions on model surfaces. This could help correlate findings between reactor studies and model surfaces, potentially leading to a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in these catalytic processes.

The current literature doesn't mention specific limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, so further research would be needed to address this aspect of the question.

这篇文献主要关注用于甲烷二氧化碳重整的PtNi双金属催化剂，而不是特别针对CO氧化或水煤气变换反应。然而，它提供了关于双金属催化剂如何影响反应器研究中的反应机理和效率的见解。

研究表明，PtNi双金属催化剂的催化性能强烈依赖于金属负载量和Ni/Pt负载比。具有最低Ni/Pt比例的催化剂（0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3）表现出最高的催化活性和稳定性。这归因于氧化镍物种更容易还原，以及由于Pt和Ni位点之间的密切相互作用而形成更小、分散更好的镍纳米粒子。

研究还调查了向进料流中添加氧气或水蒸气的影响，这导致催化剂活性和稳定性发生变化。结果表明，表面反应机理随催化剂的Pt负载量和Ni/Pt比例而变化。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及UHV研究，但它表明未来的UHV研究可以通过考察Pt-Ni相互作用和粒子大小如何影响模型表面上的表面反应，从而提供有价值的见解。这可以帮助将反应器研究和模型表面的发现相关联，可能导致对这些催化过程中涉及的基本机制有更好的理解。

当前文献没有提到关于Pt基双金属表面UHV研究的具体限制，因此需要进一步研究来解决问题的这一方面。
