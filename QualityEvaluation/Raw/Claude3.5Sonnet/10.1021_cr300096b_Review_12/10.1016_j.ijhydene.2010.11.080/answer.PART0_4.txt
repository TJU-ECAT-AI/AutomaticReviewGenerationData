[1] "A series of PtNi bimetallic catalysts supported on δ-Al2O3 to be used in carbon dioxide reforming of methane was prepared and tested with the objective of optimizing the Ni/Pt metal composition to obtain high activity and stability."

[2] "The activity results showed that the catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples strongly depended on the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio."

[3] "Among all the catalysts, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, which has the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability."

[4] "The combined characterization and catalyst performance tests results reveal that low Ni/Pt molar loading ratio of 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 sample led to a relatively easy reduction of nickel oxide species and smaller nano-sized nickel particles having better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites in the closed vicinity."

[5] "The results of the combined dry reforming and partial oxidation tests strongly indicated a change in surface reaction mechanism depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts."

The provided literature focuses on PtNi bimetallic catalysts for carbon dioxide reforming of methane, rather than specifically addressing CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. However, it does offer some insights into how these bimetallic catalysts influence methane conversion mechanisms and efficiencies.

The study shows that the catalytic performance of PtNi bimetallic catalysts strongly depends on metal loadings and the Ni/Pt loading ratio. The catalyst with the lowest Ni/Pt ratio (0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3) exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability. This suggests that the relative proportions of Pt and Ni in the catalyst significantly influence its performance.

The research reveals that a low Ni/Pt molar loading ratio leads to easier reduction of nickel oxide species and the formation of smaller, better-dispersed nickel nanoparticles. This is attributed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites in close proximity, which likely plays a crucial role in the catalyst's effectiveness.

The study also indicates that the surface reaction mechanism changes depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts, as observed in combined dry reforming and partial oxidation tests. This highlights the complex interplay between catalyst composition and reaction mechanisms.

While the literature doesn't directly address potential insights from future UHV studies, it suggests that such studies could be valuable in further exploring the relationship between catalyst composition, particle size, dispersion, and reaction mechanisms. UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could potentially provide more detailed information on the atomic-scale interactions between Pt and Ni, and how these influence catalytic performance under various reaction conditions.

提供的文献主要关注二氧化碳重整甲烷反应中的PtNi双金属催化剂，而不是特别针对CO氧化或水煤气变换反应。然而，它确实为双金属催化剂如何影响甲烷转化机制和效率提供了一些见解。

研究表明，PtNi双金属催化剂的催化性能强烈依赖于金属负载量和Ni/Pt负载比。具有最低Ni/Pt比率的催化剂（0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3）表现出最高的催化活性和稳定性。这表明催化剂中Pt和Ni的相对比例显著影响其性能。

研究揭示，低Ni/Pt摩尔负载比导致氧化镍物种更容易还原，并形成更小、分散性更好的镍纳米粒子。这被归因于Pt和Ni位点在邻近区域的密切相互作用，这可能在催化剂的有效性中起着关键作用。

研究还表明，根据催化剂的Pt负载量和Ni/Pt比率，表面反应机制会发生变化，这在干重整和部分氧化的联合测试中得到了观察。这突出了催化剂组成与反应机制之间复杂的相互作用。

虽然文献没有直接讨论未来UHV研究可能带来的见解，但它表明这类研究可能对进一步探索催化剂组成、粒子大小、分散性和反应机制之间的关系很有价值。对Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究可能会提供更详细的Pt和Ni原子尺度相互作用信息，以及这些相互作用如何在各种反应条件下影响催化性能。
