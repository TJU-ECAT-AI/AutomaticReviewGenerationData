[1] "Among the reported heterogeneous catalysts so far for the CO oxidation, PROX reaction and cathodic materials of the PEM fuel cells, supported Pt-Fe nanoparticles prepared by one improved method have been investigated by several groups"

[2] "They proposed a so-called bifunctional mechanism and pointed out that the mechanism was clearly different to that of the PROX reaction on Au catalysts supported on TiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2"

[3] "Up to know, a noncompetitive dual site mechanism has been proposed for the PROX reaction over the supported bimetallic Pt-Fe catalyst [46, 8]. It means that platinum site in Pto state acts as CO adsorption site and iron site in FeO x or Feo state as an O2 dissociative-adsorption site enhances the surface reaction between the reactants on the neighboring sites."

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts influence CO oxidation and related reactions through several mechanisms:

1. They often exhibit a bifunctional mechanism, where platinum and the second metal play different roles. For example, in Pt-Fe catalysts, Pt acts as the CO adsorption site while Fe acts as the O2 dissociative-adsorption site. This enhances surface reactions between reactants.

2. The addition of a second metal to Pt can improve catalyst activity and selectivity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. This is seen in the improved performance of Pt-Fe catalysts for preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO.

3. The mechanisms for bimetallic catalysts can differ significantly from single metal catalysts. For instance, the mechanism for Pt-Fe catalysts is described as different from Au catalysts on various supports.

4. The preparation method of bimetallic catalysts affects their structure and performance. Novel synthesis methods can produce catalysts with improved dispersion, homogeneity, and metal-metal interactions.

Future UHV studies could provide insights by:

1. Examining model surfaces that more closely mimic the structure of supported nanoparticle catalysts.

2. Investigating the atomic-scale interactions between Pt and secondary metals on surfaces.

3. Correlating surface structure and composition with reactivity for specific reactions like CO oxidation.

4. Studying the dynamics of reactant adsorption and product desorption on bimetallic surfaces.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces make direct comparisons to real catalysts challenging. Bridging this "materials gap" remains an important goal for advancing catalyst understanding.

双金属Pt基催化剂通过以下几种机制影响CO氧化和相关反应：

1. 它们通常表现出双功能机制，其中铂和第二种金属扮演不同的角色。例如，在Pt-Fe催化剂中，Pt作为CO吸附位点，而Fe作为O2解离吸附位点。这增强了反应物之间的表面反应。

2. 向Pt添加第二种金属可以改善催化剂的活性和选择性，相比于单金属Pt催化剂。这在Pt-Fe催化剂用于CO优先氧化（PROX）的改进性能中可以看出。

3. 双金属催化剂的机制可能与单金属催化剂有显著不同。例如，Pt-Fe催化剂的机制被描述为与各种支撑体上的Au催化剂不同。

4. 双金属催化剂的制备方法影响其结构和性能。新型合成方法可以生产具有改进的分散性、均匀性和金属-金属相互作用的催化剂。

未来的UHV研究可以通过以下方式提供洞见：

1. 研究更接近支撑纳米粒子催化剂结构的模型表面。

2. 研究表面上Pt和次要金属之间的原子尺度相互作用。

3. 将表面结构和成分与特定反应（如CO氧化）的反应性相关联。

4. 研究反应物在双金属表面上的吸附和产物脱附动力学。

然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究上存在局限性，使得与实际催化剂的直接比较具有挑战性。弥合这种"材料差距"仍然是推进催化剂理解的一个重要目标。
