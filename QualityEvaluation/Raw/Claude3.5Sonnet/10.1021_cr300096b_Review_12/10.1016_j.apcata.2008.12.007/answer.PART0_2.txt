[1] "The combined effect of Ni and Pt can produce a coke-resistant catalyst."

[2] "Additionally, it can be noted that mesopores are formed on both HY and Hβ dealuminated supports, which is presumably related to a secondary system formed upon dealumination. This can explain the higher values of the textural parameters of the dealuminated zeolites, as compared to the non-dealuminated solids."

[3] "Indeed, we inferred that it is not possible to estimate, from SEM analysis, the carbon deposition level and thus, the above-mentioned study is only qualitative."

[4] "It is interesting to note that in the case of bimetallic catalysts, TEM results show that the addition of Pt to the Ni/zeolite catalyst can enhance surface Ni dispersion. Therefore, the improvements in activity and stability of the PtNiY and PtNiβ catalysts are partly attributed to the promotion of Ni dispersion."

The bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtNi combinations, show improved performance in methane conversion reactions like CO2 reforming of methane. They exhibit enhanced coke resistance and increased catalytic activity compared to monometallic counterparts. This is attributed to several factors:

1. Improved metal dispersion: The addition of Pt promotes better dispersion of Ni on the zeolite support surface.

2. Synergistic effects: The combination of Pt and Ni creates a more effective catalytic system, likely due to complementary roles in reactant activation and product formation.

3. Increased accessibility: Dealumination of zeolite supports creates mesopores, improving reactant access to active sites.

4. Moderated carbon formation: Pt helps balance carbon formation and oxidation, reducing catalyst deactivation.

While these reactor studies provide valuable insights, UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could offer more detailed understanding of:

1. Surface restructuring under reaction conditions
2. Adsorption and reaction mechanisms at the atomic scale
3. The nature of active sites and their evolution during reactions
4. The role of support interactions in catalyst performance

However, UHV studies on complex bimetallic systems face challenges in accurately representing real catalytic conditions and compositions. Future work bridging the gap between UHV and high-pressure studies could provide crucial correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering a more comprehensive understanding of these catalytic systems.

基于铂的双金属催化剂，特别是PtNi组合，在甲烷转化反应（如甲烷的二氧化碳重整）中表现出改进的性能。与单金属催化剂相比，它们表现出增强的抗积炭能力和更高的催化活性。这归因于几个因素：

1. 改进的金属分散性：添加铂促进了镍在沸石载体表面的更好分散。

2. 协同效应：铂和镍的组合创造了一个更有效的催化系统，可能是由于在反应物活化和产物形成中发挥互补作用。

3. 可及性增加：沸石载体的脱铝形成介孔，改善了反应物对活性位点的可及性。

4. 碳形成的调节：铂有助于平衡碳的形成和氧化，减少催化剂失活。

虽然这些反应器研究提供了宝贵的见解，但对基于铂的双金属表面进行的超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供更详细的理解：

1. 反应条件下的表面重构
2. 原子尺度的吸附和反应机理
3. 活性位点的性质及其在反应过程中的演变
4. 载体相互作用在催化剂性能中的作用

然而，复杂双金属系统的UHV研究在准确表示实际催化条件和成分方面面临挑战。未来连接UHV和高压研究之间差距的工作可能提供模型表面和负载催化剂之间的关键相关性，为这些催化系统提供更全面的理解。
