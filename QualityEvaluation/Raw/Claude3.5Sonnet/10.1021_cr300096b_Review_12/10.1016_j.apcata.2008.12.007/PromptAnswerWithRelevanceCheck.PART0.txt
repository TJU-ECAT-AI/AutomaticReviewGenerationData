[1] "The improvement of the accessibility with dealumination of the supports, as well as the high stability of the BEA zeolite support, generated high dispersion of the metals and improved catalytic activity of this solid."

[2] "The results demonstrated that the bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalyst showed lower activity (e.g., NiPtY and NiPtβ activities were 1.70 and 1.90 gmetal1 h1, respectively) than that of the monometallic Pt/zeolite catalyst (e.g., PtY and Ptβ activities were close to 2.0 and 3.20 gmetal1 h1, respectively)."

[3] "The behaviour of NiPt bimetallic samples is quite similar to that of Ptβ; in others words, NiPtY and NiPtβ produce a large amount of graphite-like carbon and a small amount of filamentous carbon."

[4] "Indeed, we inferred that it is not possible to estimate, from SEM analysis, the carbon deposition level and thus, the above-mentioned study is only qualitative."

The literature provides some insights on bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, in methane conversion reactions:

1. Dealumination of supports improved metal dispersion and catalytic activity, especially for BEA zeolite support.

2. Bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalysts showed lower activity than monometallic Pt/zeolite catalysts in methane conversion.

3. NiPt bimetallic catalysts produced mostly graphite-like carbon and less filamentous carbon, similar to Pt on BEA zeolite (Ptβ).

4. Carbon deposition levels could not be accurately quantified using SEM analysis alone.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on CO oxidation or water gas shift reaction mechanisms for these catalysts. It also does not discuss potential insights from UHV studies or correlations with model surfaces. The document focuses mainly on methane dry reforming reactions and catalyst characterization, rather than fundamental surface science studies.

To better understand the influence of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts on reaction mechanisms and efficiencies, future UHV studies could:

1. Investigate model Pt-Ni surfaces to elucidate the synergistic effects observed in bimetallic catalysts.
2. Examine the adsorption and reaction of CO, H2O, CH4, and CO2 on well-defined bimetallic surfaces to correlate with reactor studies.
3. Use surface science techniques to study the formation and removal of different types of carbon deposits on model bimetallic surfaces.
4. Compare results from model surfaces with supported catalysts to bridge the gap between fundamental studies and practical applications.

These studies could provide valuable insights into the atomic-scale processes occurring on bimetallic catalysts and help explain the observed differences in activity and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts.

文献对双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的催化剂在甲烷转化反应中提供了一些见解：

1. 载体的脱铝改善了金属分散性和催化活性，尤其是对BEA沸石载体而言。

2. 在甲烷转化中，双金属NiPt/沸石催化剂的活性低于单金属Pt/沸石催化剂。

3. NiPt双金属催化剂主要产生石墨状碳和少量丝状碳，类似于铂负载在BEA沸石上(Ptβ)的情况。

4. 仅使用SEM分析无法准确量化碳沉积水平。

然而，文献没有提供这些催化剂在CO氧化或水气变换反应机理方面的具体信息。它也没有讨论超高真空(UHV)研究的潜在见解或与模型表面的相关性。该文档主要关注甲烷干重整反应和催化剂表征，而不是基础表面科学研究。

为了更好地理解基于铂的双金属催化剂对反应机理和效率的影响，未来的UHV研究可以：

1. 研究Pt-Ni模型表面，以阐明在双金属催化剂中观察到的协同效应。
2. 检查CO、H2O、CH4和CO2在定义良好的双金属表面上的吸附和反应，以与反应器研究相关联。
3. 使用表面科学技术研究不同类型碳沉积物在模型双金属表面上的形成和去除。
4. 比较模型表面与负载催化剂的结果，以弥合基础研究与实际应用之间的差距。

这些研究可以提供关于双金属催化剂上原子尺度过程的宝贵见解，并有助于解释与单金属催化剂相比观察到的活性和选择性差异。

[1] "The bimetallic NiPt catalysts supported on HY or Hβ zeolites were prepared by a successive impregnation method using an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O followed by addition of H2PtCl6·6H2O in ethanol."

[2] "The combined effect of Ni and Pt can produce a coke-resistant catalyst."

[3] "Indeed, we investigated the influence of the acidity on the catalytic properties by using dealuminated supports, with the aim of clarifying the factors involved in controlling the stability, coking, and activity of the solids studied."

[4] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts can also be explained by the fact that the presence of a second metal such as platinum exposes the nickel to the reactants, meaning a redispersion of Ni occurs due to the addition/dispersion of a second metal, e.g., platinum"

[5] "In addition, in the case of NiPt bimetallic systems, the rate of decomposition of methane is slower than that on monometallic nickel systems. This is explained by the large lability of the type of carbon species formed on the bimetallic samples."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversions in several ways:

1. They produce more coke-resistant catalysts compared to monometallic systems. 

2. The presence of Pt helps to expose Ni to reactants by causing a redispersion of Ni particles.

3. NiPt bimetallic systems slow down the rate of methane decomposition compared to monometallic Ni catalysts.

4. The carbon species formed on bimetallic samples are more labile, which helps maintain catalyst activity.

5. The acidity of the support plays a crucial role in controlling stability, coking, and activity of the catalysts.

The literature does not provide specific information about CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions for these catalysts. 

Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into:

1. The atomic-scale interactions between Pt and Ni on model surfaces.
2. The mechanism of carbon species formation and removal on bimetallic surfaces.
3. The role of support acidity in catalyst performance at the molecular level.
4. Direct observation of reactant adsorption and product desorption processes.

These studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts by elucidating fundamental surface processes that govern catalyst performance.

[1] "The combined effect of Ni and Pt can produce a coke-resistant catalyst."

[2] "Additionally, it can be noted that mesopores are formed on both HY and Hβ dealuminated supports, which is presumably related to a secondary system formed upon dealumination. This can explain the higher values of the textural parameters of the dealuminated zeolites, as compared to the non-dealuminated solids."

[3] "Indeed, we inferred that it is not possible to estimate, from SEM analysis, the carbon deposition level and thus, the above-mentioned study is only qualitative."

[4] "It is interesting to note that in the case of bimetallic catalysts, TEM results show that the addition of Pt to the Ni/zeolite catalyst can enhance surface Ni dispersion. Therefore, the improvements in activity and stability of the PtNiY and PtNiβ catalysts are partly attributed to the promotion of Ni dispersion."

The bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtNi combinations, show improved performance in methane conversion reactions like CO2 reforming of methane. They exhibit enhanced coke resistance and increased catalytic activity compared to monometallic counterparts. This is attributed to several factors:

1. Improved metal dispersion: The addition of Pt promotes better dispersion of Ni on the zeolite support surface.

2. Synergistic effects: The combination of Pt and Ni creates a more effective catalytic system, likely due to complementary roles in reactant activation and product formation.

3. Increased accessibility: Dealumination of zeolite supports creates mesopores, improving reactant access to active sites.

4. Moderated carbon formation: Pt helps balance carbon formation and oxidation, reducing catalyst deactivation.

While these reactor studies provide valuable insights, UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces could offer more detailed understanding of:

1. Surface restructuring under reaction conditions
2. Adsorption and reaction mechanisms at the atomic scale
3. The nature of active sites and their evolution during reactions
4. The role of support interactions in catalyst performance

However, UHV studies on complex bimetallic systems face challenges in accurately representing real catalytic conditions and compositions. Future work bridging the gap between UHV and high-pressure studies could provide crucial correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering a more comprehensive understanding of these catalytic systems.

基于铂的双金属催化剂，特别是PtNi组合，在甲烷转化反应（如甲烷的二氧化碳重整）中表现出改进的性能。与单金属催化剂相比，它们表现出增强的抗积炭能力和更高的催化活性。这归因于几个因素：

1. 改进的金属分散性：添加铂促进了镍在沸石载体表面的更好分散。

2. 协同效应：铂和镍的组合创造了一个更有效的催化系统，可能是由于在反应物活化和产物形成中发挥互补作用。

3. 可及性增加：沸石载体的脱铝形成介孔，改善了反应物对活性位点的可及性。

4. 碳形成的调节：铂有助于平衡碳的形成和氧化，减少催化剂失活。

虽然这些反应器研究提供了宝贵的见解，但对基于铂的双金属表面进行的超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供更详细的理解：

1. 反应条件下的表面重构
2. 原子尺度的吸附和反应机理
3. 活性位点的性质及其在反应过程中的演变
4. 载体相互作用在催化剂性能中的作用

然而，复杂双金属系统的UHV研究在准确表示实际催化条件和成分方面面临挑战。未来连接UHV和高压研究之间差距的工作可能提供模型表面和负载催化剂之间的关键相关性，为这些催化系统提供更全面的理解。

[2] "In the case of Pt dispersed on BEA zeolite, it produced lower carbon deposition (16 wt%) and this coke was easily removed by CO2."

[3] "The mechanistic investigations reveal that the dispersion of carbon during the dry reforming of methane is the result of a number of adsorption and elementary chemical steps. First, methane cracking and Boudouard reactions (reactions (VIII) and (XIX)) produce surface carbon on the Ni particles embedded in the support. Second, the diffusion of carbon through the Ni particles occurs, followed by segregation at the rear. Finally, the Ni particle is lifted from the support by a growing carbon filament."

[4] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts can also be explained by the fact that the presence of a second metal such as platinum exposes the nickel to the reactants, meaning a redispersion of Ni occurs due to the addition/dispersion of a second metal, e.g., platinum"

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provides some insights into how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversion in reactor studies:

1. Bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalysts showed lower activity than monometallic Pt/zeolite catalysts for methane conversion. This suggests that the addition of Ni to Pt does not always improve catalytic performance.

2. Pt dispersed on BEA zeolite produced less carbon deposition, which could be easily removed by CO2. This indicates that Pt helps resist coking and promotes carbon removal.

3. In bimetallic catalysts, the presence of Pt helps expose Ni to reactants by causing redispersion of Ni. This synergistic effect between the two metals can enhance catalytic activity.

4. The mechanistic steps for carbon formation and growth during methane reforming were outlined, involving methane cracking, carbon diffusion through metal particles, and carbon filament growth.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions for these catalysts. Additionally, it does not discuss potential insights from UHV studies or correlations with model surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially provide atomic-level insights into the interactions between Pt and Ni on catalyst surfaces, the nature of active sites, and how these factors influence reactivity and selectivity. Such studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts used in reactor studies, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of reaction mechanisms and catalyst behavior.
