[1] "The results demonstrated that the bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalyst showed lower activity (e.g., NiPtY and NiPtβ activities were 1.70 and 1.90 gmetal1 h1, respectively) than that of the monometallic Pt/zeolite catalyst (e.g., PtY and Ptβ activities were close to 2.0 and 3.20 gmetal1 h1, respectively)."

[2] "In the case of Pt dispersed on BEA zeolite, it produced lower carbon deposition (16 wt%) and this coke was easily removed by CO2."

[3] "The mechanistic investigations reveal that the dispersion of carbon during the dry reforming of methane is the result of a number of adsorption and elementary chemical steps. First, methane cracking and Boudouard reactions (reactions (VIII) and (XIX)) produce surface carbon on the Ni particles embedded in the support. Second, the diffusion of carbon through the Ni particles occurs, followed by segregation at the rear. Finally, the Ni particle is lifted from the support by a growing carbon filament."

[4] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts can also be explained by the fact that the presence of a second metal such as platinum exposes the nickel to the reactants, meaning a redispersion of Ni occurs due to the addition/dispersion of a second metal, e.g., platinum"

The literature provides some insights into how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversion in reactor studies:

1. Bimetallic NiPt/zeolite catalysts showed lower activity than monometallic Pt/zeolite catalysts for methane conversion. This suggests that the addition of Ni to Pt does not always improve catalytic performance.

2. Pt dispersed on BEA zeolite produced less carbon deposition, which could be easily removed by CO2. This indicates that Pt helps resist coking and promotes carbon removal.

3. In bimetallic catalysts, the presence of Pt helps expose Ni to reactants by causing redispersion of Ni. This synergistic effect between the two metals can enhance catalytic activity.

4. The mechanistic steps for carbon formation and growth during methane reforming were outlined, involving methane cracking, carbon diffusion through metal particles, and carbon filament growth.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions for these catalysts. Additionally, it does not discuss potential insights from UHV studies or correlations with model surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially provide atomic-level insights into the interactions between Pt and Ni on catalyst surfaces, the nature of active sites, and how these factors influence reactivity and selectivity. Such studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts used in reactor studies, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of reaction mechanisms and catalyst behavior.

文献为双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，如何影响反应器研究中甲烷转化的机制和效率提供了一些见解：

1. 双金属NiPt/沸石催化剂的活性比单金属Pt/沸石催化剂低。这表明向Pt中添加Ni并不总是能提高催化性能。

2. 分散在BEA沸石上的Pt产生的碳沉积较少，并且可以被CO2轻易去除。这表明Pt有助于抵抗结焦并促进碳的去除。

3. 在双金属催化剂中，Pt的存在通过引起Ni的重新分散，帮助将Ni暴露给反应物。这种两种金属之间的协同效应可以增强催化活性。

4. 概述了甲烷重整过程中碳形成和生长的机制步骤，包括甲烷裂解、碳通过金属颗粒扩散以及碳纤维生长。

然而，文献并未提供这些催化剂在CO氧化或水煤气变换反应方面的具体信息。此外，也没有讨论超高真空(UHV)研究的潜在见解或与模型表面的相关性。未来的UHV研究可能会为催化剂表面上Pt和Ni之间的相互作用、活性位点的性质以及这些因素如何影响反应性和选择性提供原子水平的见解。这些研究可以帮助弥合模型表面和反应器研究中使用的负载型催化剂之间的差距，从而对反应机理和催化剂行为有更全面的理解。
