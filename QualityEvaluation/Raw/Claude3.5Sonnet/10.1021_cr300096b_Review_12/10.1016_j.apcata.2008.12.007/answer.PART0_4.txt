[1] "The bimetallic NiPt catalysts supported on HY or Hβ zeolites were prepared by a successive impregnation method using an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O followed by addition of H2PtCl6·6H2O in ethanol."

[2] "In the case of bimetallic samples, the percentage of unreduced nickel (Ni2+) for the bimetallic samples is higher then the monometallic ones, i.e., the reducibility of the nickel species is complicated by the presence of platinum."

[3] "The behaviour of NiPt bimetallic samples is quite similar to that of Ptβ; in others words, NiPtY and NiPtβ produce a large amount of graphite-like carbon and a small amount of filamentous carbon."

[4] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts can also be explained by the fact that the presence of a second metal such as platinum exposes the nickel to the reactants, meaning a redispersion of Ni occurs due to the addition/dispersion of a second metal, e.g., platinum"

[5] "In addition, in the case of NiPt bimetallic systems, the rate of decomposition of methane is slower than that on monometallic nickel systems. This is explained by the large lability of the type of carbon species formed on the bimetallic samples."

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in several ways:

1. They promote the redispersion of Ni, exposing more active sites to reactants.

2. They slow down the rate of methane decomposition compared to monometallic Ni catalysts.

3. They produce more graphite-like carbon and less filamentous carbon compared to monometallic catalysts.

4. The presence of Pt complicates the reducibility of Ni species.

5. They form carbon species with higher lability, which can be more easily removed.

Future UHV studies could provide insights by:

1. Examining the atomic-scale interactions between Pt and Ni on model surfaces.

2. Investigating the formation and removal of different carbon species on bimetallic surfaces.

3. Studying the adsorption and reaction mechanisms of CO, H2O, and CH4 on bimetallic surfaces.

4. Correlating the surface structure and composition with catalytic activity and selectivity.

5. Exploring the effects of support materials on the properties of bimetallic particles.

These UHV studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes occurring during catalysis.

双金属Pt基催化剂通过以下几种方式影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机理和效率：

1. 它们促进Ni的再分散，使更多活性位点暴露给反应物。

2. 与单金属Ni催化剂相比，它们减缓了甲烷分解的速率。

3. 与单金属催化剂相比，它们产生更多的石墨状碳和更少的丝状碳。

4. Pt的存在使Ni物种的还原性变得更加复杂。

5. 它们形成活性更高的碳物种，这些碳物种更容易被移除。

未来的UHV研究可以通过以下方式提供见解：

1. 研究模型表面上Pt和Ni之间的原子尺度相互作用。

2. 调查双金属表面上不同碳物种的形成和去除过程。

3. 研究CO、H2O和CH4在双金属表面上的吸附和反应机理。

4. 将表面结构和成分与催化活性和选择性相关联。

5. 探索载体材料对双金属颗粒性质的影响。

这些UHV研究可以帮助弥合模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距，为催化过程中发生的基本过程提供更深入的理解。
