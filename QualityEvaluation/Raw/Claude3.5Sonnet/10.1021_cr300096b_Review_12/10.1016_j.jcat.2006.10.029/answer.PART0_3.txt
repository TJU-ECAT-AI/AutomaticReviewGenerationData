[1] "For the oxidation reaction of methane, stable conversion was observed only for the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst, where both metallic Pd and PdO coexist on the surface, whereas for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, all Pd transformed into PdO over time."

[2] "The activity over PdPt/Al2O3 was greater than that over Pd/Al2O3 after 6.6 h for the conditions used in this study."

[3] "The thermal aging was worse for Pd/Al2O3 than for PdPt/Al2O3. Thus, Pt prevents the aging of Pd catalysts."

[4] "The morphology of the noble metal particles in PdPt/Al2O3 consisted of two parts, one rich in PdO and the other consisting of an alloy between Pd and Pt. These two parts were always found in close contact."

The literature provides insights into the influence of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts on methane conversion:

1. PdPt/Al2O3 catalysts show more stable methane conversion compared to Pd/Al2O3, due to the coexistence of metallic Pd and PdO on the surface.

2. PdPt/Al2O3 catalysts demonstrate higher activity for methane conversion over time compared to Pd/Al2O3.

3. The addition of Pt prevents aging of Pd catalysts, improving thermal stability.

4. The morphology of PdPt/Al2O3 catalysts consists of two parts - a PdO-rich region and a Pd-Pt alloy, which are in close contact.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts by:

1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of PdPt alloys under reaction conditions.
2. Studying the dynamics of PdO formation and decomposition on PdPt surfaces.
3. Examining the role of the Pd-Pt interface in catalytic activity and stability.
4. Comparing the behavior of model PdPt surfaces with supported PdPt catalysts to bridge the materials gap.

These UHV studies could provide atomic-level insights into the mechanisms behind the improved performance of PdPt bimetallic catalysts, helping to design more efficient and stable catalysts for various reactions.

文献为Pt基双金属催化剂对甲烷转化的影响提供了以下见解：

1. 与Pd/Al2O3相比，PdPt/Al2O3催化剂表现出更稳定的甲烷转化，这是由于表面金属Pd和PdO的共存。

2. 随着时间的推移，PdPt/Al2O3催化剂比Pd/Al2O3表现出更高的甲烷转化活性。

3. 添加Pt可以防止Pd催化剂老化，提高热稳定性。

4. PdPt/Al2O3催化剂的形态由两部分组成 - PdO富集区和Pd-Pt合金，两者紧密接触。

然而，文献没有提供关于CO氧化或水煤气变换反应的具体信息。未来的UHV研究可能通过以下方式将这些发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联：

1. 研究反应条件下PdPt合金的表面结构和成分。
2. 研究PdPt表面上PdO的形成和分解动力学。
3. 研究Pd-Pt界面在催化活性和稳定性中的作用。
4. 比较模型PdPt表面与负载型PdPt催化剂的行为，以弥合材料差距。

这些UHV研究可以提供PdPt双金属催化剂性能改善背后机制的原子级见解，有助于设计更高效、更稳定的各种反应催化剂。
