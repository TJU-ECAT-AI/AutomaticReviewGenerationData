[1] "The activity over PdPt/Al2O3 was greater than that over Pd/Al2O3 after 6.6 h for the conditions used in this study."

[2] "The activity of PdPt/Al2O3 increased with time. Results from TPO, XRD, XPS, and TEM indicate that the increase was due to significantly greater PdO production during operation."

[3] "The morphology of the noble metal particles in PdPt/Al2O3 consisted of two parts, one rich in PdO and the other consisting of an alloy between Pd and Pt. These two parts were always found in close contact."

[4] "For the oxidation reaction of methane, stable conversion was observed only for the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst, where both metallic Pd and PdO coexist on the surface, whereas for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, all Pd transformed into PdO over time."

[5] "The thermal aging was worse for Pd/Al2O3 than for PdPt/Al2O3. Thus, Pt prevents the aging of Pd catalysts."

This study focuses on Pd-Pt bimetallic catalysts rather than pure Pt-based ones, so it does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. However, for methane oxidation, the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst showed several advantages over monometallic Pd/Al2O3:

1. Higher activity after extended operation time
2. Increasing activity over time due to greater PdO production
3. Unique morphology with PdO-rich and PdPt alloy domains in close contact
4. More stable methane conversion, with both metallic Pd and PdO coexisting on the surface
5. Better resistance to thermal aging

The study does not discuss UHV studies, so potential insights from such experiments cannot be directly inferred. However, the detailed characterization of catalyst morphology and oxidation states suggests that UHV studies comparing Pd, Pt, and PdPt surfaces could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms behind the improved performance of the bimetallic catalyst, particularly regarding the synergistic effects between Pd and Pt in maintaining both metallic and oxide phases.

这项研究主要关注Pd-Pt双金属催化剂，而非纯Pt基催化剂，因此没有直接涉及CO氧化或水气变换反应。然而，对于甲烷氧化，PdPt/Al2O3催化剂相比单金属Pd/Al2O3表现出几个优势：

1. 长时间运行后活性更高
2. 由于PdO生成量增加，活性随时间增加
3. 具有独特的形态，PdO富集区域和PdPt合金区域紧密接触
4. 甲烷转化更稳定，金属Pd和PdO在表面共存
5. 对热老化的抗性更好

这项研究没有讨论超高真空(UHV)实验，因此无法直接推断这类实验可能带来的洞见。然而，对催化剂形态和氧化态的详细表征表明，比较Pd、Pt和PdPt表面的UHV研究可能为双金属催化剂性能改善的机制提供有价值的见解，特别是关于Pd和Pt在维持金属相和氧化物相方面的协同效应。
