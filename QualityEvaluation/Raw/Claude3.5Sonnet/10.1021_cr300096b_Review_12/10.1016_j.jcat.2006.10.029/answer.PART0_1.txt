[1] "The activity over PdPt/Al2O3 was greater than that over Pd/Al2O3 after 6.6 h for the conditions used in this study."

[2] "The activity of PdPt/Al2O3 increased with time. Results from TPO, XRD, XPS, and TEM indicate that the increase was due to significantly greater PdO production during operation."

[3] "The morphology of the noble metal particles in PdPt/Al2O3 consisted of two parts, one rich in PdO and the other consisting of an alloy between Pd and Pt. These two parts were always found in close contact."

[4] "For the oxidation reaction of methane, stable conversion was observed only for the PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst, where both metallic Pd and PdO coexist on the surface, whereas for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, all Pd transformed into PdO over time."

[5] "The thermal aging was worse for Pd/Al2O3 than for PdPt/Al2O3. Thus, Pt prevents the aging of Pd catalysts."

The bimetallic PdPt catalyst showed superior performance compared to the monometallic Pd catalyst for methane oxidation. The PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated increased activity over time and better stability, while the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst experienced significant deactivation. This enhanced performance of the bimetallic catalyst is attributed to several factors:

1. Greater PdO production during operation, which is more active for methane combustion.

2. A unique morphology consisting of PdO-rich regions in close contact with PdPt alloy regions, allowing for beneficial synergistic effects.

3. The coexistence of metallic Pd and PdO on the surface, which promotes stable methane conversion.

4. Improved resistance to thermal aging, with Pt preventing the degradation of Pd catalysts.

While this study focuses on methane oxidation, similar mechanisms may apply to CO oxidation and water-gas shift reactions. However, the literature does not provide specific information on these reactions.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by:

1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of model PdPt surfaces under various conditions.

2. Examining the interaction between PdO and PdPt alloy regions at the atomic scale.

3. Studying the dynamics of PdO formation and decomposition on bimetallic surfaces.

4. Correlating UHV observations with the performance of supported catalysts under realistic reaction conditions.

Such studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and practical catalysts, providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the enhanced performance of bimetallic catalysts.

与单金属Pd催化剂相比，双金属PdPt催化剂在甲烷氧化方面表现出更优异的性能。PdPt/Al2O3催化剂随时间推移活性增加，稳定性更好，而Pd/Al2O3催化剂则经历了显著的失活。双金属催化剂的这种增强性能归因于几个因素：

1. 在操作过程中产生更多的PdO，这对甲烷燃烧更为活跃。

2. 独特的形态结构，PdO富集区域与PdPt合金区域紧密接触，允许有益的协同效应。

3. 金属Pd和PdO在表面共存，促进稳定的甲烷转化。

4. 对热老化的抗性更强，Pt防止Pd催化剂退化。

虽然这项研究主要集中在甲烷氧化上，但类似的机制可能适用于CO氧化和水煤气变换反应。然而，文献中并未提供关于这些反应的具体信息。

未来的UHV研究可能提供有价值的见解，通过：

1. 在各种条件下研究模型PdPt表面的结构和组成。

2. 在原子尺度上检查PdO和PdPt合金区域之间的相互作用。

3. 研究双金属表面上PdO形成和分解的动态过程。

4. 将UHV观察结果与实际反应条件下负载型催化剂的性能相关联。

这些研究可以帮助弥合模型表面和实用催化剂之间的差距，为理解双金属催化剂增强性能的底层机制提供更深入的认识。
