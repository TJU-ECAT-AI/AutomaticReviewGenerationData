[1] "Besides, in the bimetallic catalysts, there is a Pt-Ni interaction between metallic centers, which enhances the catalyst stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO."

[2] "Adding Pt and/or preparing the catalysts by ME the Ni0 and Pt0 particles size can be controlled and the metal encapsulation by carbon avoided. The activity and stability of the PtNi nanocatalysts is improved when the metal ensembles have similar dimensions to the fibers of the support, which avoids metal sintering and the insertion of Ni into the alumina structure."

[3] "Monometallic and bimetallic PtNi catalysts prepared by ME and supported on the nanofibrous alumina seem to be successful catalysts for the DRM, with high selectivity towards H2/CO and low towards coke."

The literature provides some insights into how bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts influence methane conversion in dry reforming of methane (DRM) reactions. The Pt-Ni interaction enhances catalyst stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO production. By controlling particle size through preparation methods like microemulsion (ME), carbon encapsulation is avoided and activity is improved. These catalysts show high selectivity for H2/CO production and low selectivity for coke formation.

However, the literature does not specifically address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. It also does not discuss UHV studies or model surfaces. To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed on:

1. How Pt-Ni catalysts affect CO oxidation and water gas shift reactions
2. Correlations between reactor studies and UHV studies on model surfaces
3. Current limitations in UHV studies of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces
4. Potential insights that future UHV studies could provide

The available information is limited to methane conversion in DRM reactions using supported Pt-Ni catalysts prepared by specific methods. More comprehensive studies would be required to address all aspects of the question.

文献为我们提供了一些关于双金属Pt-Ni催化剂如何影响甲烷干重整(DRM)反应中甲烷转化的见解。Pt-Ni之间的相互作用增强了催化剂的稳定性和对H2和CO产物的选择性。通过微乳液(ME)等制备方法控制粒子尺寸，可以避免碳包覆并提高活性。这些催化剂对H2/CO产物显示出高选择性，而对积碳形成的选择性较低。

然而，文献并未具体讨论CO氧化或水气变换反应。也没有涉及UHV研究或模型表面。要全面回答这个问题，还需要对以下方面进行额外研究：

1. Pt-Ni催化剂如何影响CO氧化和水气变换反应
2. 反应器研究与模型表面上的UHV研究之间的相关性
3. UHV研究Pt基双金属表面的当前限制
4. 未来UHV研究可能提供的潜在见解

现有信息仅限于使用特定方法制备的负载型Pt-Ni催化剂在DRM反应中的甲烷转化。要解答问题的所有方面，还需要进行更全面的研究。
