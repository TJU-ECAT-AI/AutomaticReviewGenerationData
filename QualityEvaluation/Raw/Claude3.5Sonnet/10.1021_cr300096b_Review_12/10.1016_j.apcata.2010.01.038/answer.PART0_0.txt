[1] "Besides, in the bimetallic catalysts, there is a Pt-Ni interaction between metallic centers, which enhances the catalyst stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO."

[2] "It is interesting to point out that, in the Ni containing catalysts the Ni0/NiAl2O4 and the Ni0/NiO ratios increased when Pt was incorporated and when the catalysts were prepared by ME, as can be observed in Table 5."

[3] "Characterization results indicate that the incorporation of Pt in Ni-based catalyst has a great influence on the Ni species distribution, the Ni particle size and dispersion, in addition to the net carbon formation. In the bimetallic PtNi catalyst there is a synergic effect between PtNi which modifies the Ni disposition, as well as its reducibility by the spillover of hydrogen from Pt to Ni"

[4] "Adding Pt and/or preparing the catalysts by ME the Ni0 and Pt0 particles size can be controlled and the metal encapsulation by carbon avoided. The activity and stability of the PtNi nanocatalysts is improved when the metal ensembles have similar dimensions to the fibers of the support, which avoids metal sintering and the insertion of Ni into the alumina structure."

The literature provides insights into how bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts influence methane conversion mechanisms and efficiencies in reactor studies, but does not specifically address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. 

For methane conversion, bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts show enhanced stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO compared to monometallic catalysts. The addition of Pt to Ni-based catalysts influences Ni species distribution, particle size, and dispersion, while also reducing carbon formation. There is a synergistic effect between Pt and Ni that modifies Ni disposition and improves its reducibility through hydrogen spillover from Pt to Ni.

The preparation method (reverse microemulsion) and support (nanofibrous alumina) play crucial roles in controlling particle size and preventing carbon encapsulation of metal particles. This results in improved activity and stability of the PtNi nanocatalysts, particularly when the metal ensembles have similar dimensions to the support fibers.

While the literature does not discuss UHV studies, future research in this area could potentially provide valuable insights into the surface chemistry and atomic-scale interactions of Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts. Such studies could help correlate the findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially elucidating the fundamental mechanisms behind the observed synergistic effects and improved catalytic performance.

文献为双金属Pt-Ni催化剂如何影响反应器研究中的甲烷转化机理和效率提供了见解,但并未具体讨论CO氧化或水气变换反应。

对于甲烷转化,与单金属催化剂相比,双金属Pt-Ni催化剂表现出更高的稳定性和对H2和CO的选择性。将Pt添加到基于Ni的催化剂中会影响Ni物种的分布、粒子大小和分散度,同时也减少碳的形成。Pt和Ni之间存在协同效应,可以改变Ni的分布并通过Pt到Ni的氢溢流提高其还原性。

制备方法(反相微乳液法)和载体(纳米纤维氧化铝)在控制粒子大小和防止金属粒子被碳包覆方面起着关键作用。当金属集合体的尺寸与载体纤维相似时,这会导致PtNi纳米催化剂的活性和稳定性得到改善。

虽然文献没有讨论UHV研究,但未来在这一领域的研究可能会为Pt-Ni双金属催化剂的表面化学和原子尺度相互作用提供有价值的见解。这些研究可能有助于将反应器研究的发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联,潜在地阐明观察到的协同效应和改进的催化性能背后的基本机制。
