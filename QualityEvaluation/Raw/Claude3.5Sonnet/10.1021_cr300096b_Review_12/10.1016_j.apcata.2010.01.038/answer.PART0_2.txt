[1] "Besides, in the bimetallic catalysts, there is a Pt-Ni interaction between metallic centers, which enhances the catalyst stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO."

[2] "Adding Pt and/or preparing the catalysts by ME the Ni0 and Pt0 particles size can be controlled and the metal encapsulation by carbon avoided. The activity and stability of the PtNi nanocatalysts is improved when the metal ensembles have similar dimensions to the fibers of the support, which avoids metal sintering and the insertion of Ni into the alumina structure."

[3] "Monometallic and bimetallic PtNi catalysts prepared by ME and supported on the nanofibrous alumina seem to be successful catalysts for the DRM, with high selectivity towards H2/CO and low towards coke."

The literature provides some insights into how bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts influence methane conversion in dry reforming of methane (DRM) reactions. The Pt-Ni interaction enhances catalyst stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO. Adding Pt helps control particle size and avoid carbon encapsulation, improving activity and stability. The bimetallic catalysts show high selectivity towards H2/CO and low selectivity towards coke formation.

However, the literature does not specifically address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. It also does not discuss UHV studies or model surfaces. The information is limited to reactor studies on supported catalysts for DRM.

To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed on:
1. CO oxidation and water gas shift reaction mechanisms with Pt-based bimetallic catalysts
2. UHV studies correlating reactor findings with model surfaces 
3. Comparisons between supported catalysts and model surfaces for these reactions

The current literature provides a starting point, but cannot comprehensively address all aspects of the question.

这篇文献为我们提供了一些关于双金属Pt-Ni催化剂如何影响甲烷干重整(DRM)反应中甲烷转化的见解。Pt-Ni之间的相互作用增强了催化剂的稳定性和对H2和CO的选择性。添加Pt有助于控制粒子大小并避免碳包覆，从而提高活性和稳定性。双金属催化剂对H2/CO显示出高选择性，而对焦炭形成的选择性低。

然而，这篇文献并未特别讨论CO氧化或水气变换反应。它也没有讨论UHV研究或模型表面。信息仅限于DRM支持催化剂的反应器研究。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要对以下方面进行额外研究：
1. 基于Pt的双金属催化剂在CO氧化和水气变换反应中的机理
2. 将反应器研究结果与模型表面相关联的UHV研究
3. 这些反应中支持催化剂与模型表面的比较

当前的文献提供了一个起点，但无法全面解答问题的所有方面。
