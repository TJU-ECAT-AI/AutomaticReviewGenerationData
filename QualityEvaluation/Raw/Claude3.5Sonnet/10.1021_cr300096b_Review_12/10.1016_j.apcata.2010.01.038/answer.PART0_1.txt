[1] "Besides, in the bimetallic catalysts, there is a Pt-Ni interaction between metallic centers, which enhances the catalyst stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO."

[2] "It is interesting to point out that all the peaks seem to be shifted to lower reduction temperatures, which indicates that the incorporation of Pt promotes the reducibility of Ni."

[3] "In the bimetallic PtNi catalyst there is a synergic effect between PtNi which modifies the Ni disposition, as well as its reducibility by the spillover of hydrogen from Pt to Ni"

[4] "The addition of Pt breaks up the large metallic ensembles that favor carbon deposition. It is well known that the carbon adsorbed on small metal particles diffuses with greater difficulty than when adsorbed on large particles"

The literature provides some insights into how bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts influence reaction mechanisms and efficiencies, particularly for dry reforming of methane (DRM). The Pt-Ni interaction enhances catalyst stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO production. Pt incorporation promotes Ni reducibility by facilitating hydrogen spillover. It also breaks up large metallic ensembles, resulting in smaller particles that inhibit carbon diffusion and deposition.

However, the literature does not specifically address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. It also does not discuss UHV studies or model surfaces. To better correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, future UHV studies could investigate:

1. The nature of Pt-Ni interactions on well-defined surfaces
2. How particle size affects carbon adsorption and diffusion
3. The mechanism of hydrogen spillover from Pt to Ni
4. The impact of support materials on Pt-Ni synergies

Such studies could provide atomic-level insights into the mechanisms observed in reactor studies, helping to bridge the gap between model and real catalytic systems.

文献为双金属Pt-Ni催化剂如何影响反应机理和效率提供了一些见解,特别是对于甲烷的干重整(DRM)反应。Pt-Ni之间的相互作用增强了催化剂的稳定性和对H2和CO产物的选择性。Pt的引入通过促进氢溢流来提高Ni的可还原性。它还打破了大的金属团簇,形成较小的粒子,抑制碳的扩散和沉积。

然而,文献并未具体讨论CO氧化或水煤气变换反应。也没有讨论UHV研究或模型表面。为了更好地将这些发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联,未来的UHV研究可以探讨:

1. 在定义明确的表面上Pt-Ni相互作用的本质
2. 粒子尺寸如何影响碳的吸附和扩散
3. 氢从Pt溢流到Ni的机理
4. 载体材料对Pt-Ni协同作用的影响

这些研究可以为反应器研究中观察到的机理提供原子级的见解,有助于弥合模型系统和实际催化系统之间的差距。
