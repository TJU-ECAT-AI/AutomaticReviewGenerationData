[1] "At present there are few UHV studies of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. The overview will therefore focus primarily on reactor studies, with the anticipation that the intriguing properties of these catalysts would inspire future UHV studies to correlate model surfaces with supported catalysts."

[2] "The oxidation of CO is also studied on Fe/Pt(111), with the bimetallic surface structures being reversibly controlled between FeO/Pt(111) and subsurface PtFePt(111) via alternating oxidation and reduction treatments."

[3] "PtFe/γ-Al2O3, PtFe2/γ-Al2O3, and PtFe3/γ-Al2O3 outperform Pt/γ-Al2O3 for the PROX of CO in a combined stream of CO and H2."

[4] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are active for the WGS reaction and show enhanced activity when alloyed with Re, Co, and Au."

[5] "PtCo catalysts have been shown to convert methane into C2+ products with higher conversion than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

[6] "PtNi supported on MgAl2O4 exhibits self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics. Without prereduction, the PtNi bimetallic catalyst dissociates CH4 under reaction conditions to form hydrogen, which spills over and reduces other metallic particles on the catalyst."

Pt-based bimetallic catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies:

1. CO Oxidation: Bimetallic catalysts like PtFe and PtNi show improved performance compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The surface structures can be reversibly controlled between oxide and subsurface alloy states, leading to tunable activity. PtFe catalysts outperform Pt for preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in H2 streams.

2. Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction: Pt-based bimetallic catalysts alloyed with Re, Co, or Au demonstrate enhanced WGS activity compared to monometallic Pt. The alloyed metal and dispersion play crucial roles in the activity.

3. Methane Conversions: PtCo catalysts show higher conversion of methane to C2+ products than monometallic catalysts. PtNi catalysts exhibit self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics in methane steam reforming, preventing deactivation and improving performance.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by:

1. Correlating the surface structures and compositions observed in reactor studies with those on model surfaces.
2. Investigating the atomic-scale mechanisms of the reversible structural changes observed in reactor studies.
3. Studying the role of support materials and their interactions with bimetallic particles in model systems.
4. Examining the effects of reaction conditions on surface composition and structure in controlled UHV environments.

These studies could bridge the gap between reactor studies and fundamental surface science, leading to a deeper understanding of the catalytic processes and potentially guiding the design of more efficient catalysts.

铂基双金属催化剂在反应器研究中显著影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机理和效率：

1. CO氧化：PtFe和PtNi等双金属催化剂比单金属Pt催化剂表现更好。表面结构可以在氧化物和亚表面合金状态之间可逆控制，导致可调节的活性。PtFe催化剂在H2流中的CO优先氧化（PROX）方面优于Pt。

2. 水煤气变换（WGS）反应：与Re、Co或Au合金化的铂基双金属催化剂比单金属Pt表现出更强的WGS活性。合金化的金属和分散度在活性中起着关键作用。

3. 甲烷转化：PtCo催化剂在甲烷转化为C2+产物方面表现出比单金属催化剂更高的转化率。PtNi催化剂在甲烷蒸汽重整中表现出自激活和自再生特性，防止失活并提高性能。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供有价值的见解：

1. 将反应器研究中观察到的表面结构和成分与模型表面上的相关联。
2. 研究反应器研究中观察到的可逆结构变化的原子尺度机理。
3. 在模型系统中研究载体材料及其与双金属颗粒的相互作用。
4. 在受控的UHV环境中检查反应条件对表面成分和结构的影响。

这些研究可以弥合反应器研究和基础表面科学之间的差距，从而深入理解催化过程，并可能指导更高效催化剂的设计。
