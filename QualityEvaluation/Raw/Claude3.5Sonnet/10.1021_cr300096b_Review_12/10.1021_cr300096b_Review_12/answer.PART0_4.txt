[1] "At present there are few UHV studies of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. The overview will therefore focus primarily on reactor studies, with the anticipation that the intriguing properties of these catalysts would inspire future UHV studies to correlate model surfaces with supported catalysts."

[2] "The oxidation of CO is also studied on Fe/Pt(111), with the bimetallic surface structures being reversibly controlled between FeO/Pt(111) and subsurface PtFePt(111) via alternating oxidation and reduction treatments."

[3] "PtFe/γ-Al2O3, PtFe2/γ-Al2O3, and PtFe3/γ-Al2O3 outperform Pt/γ-Al2O3 for the PROX of CO in a combined stream of CO and H2."

[4] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are active for the WGS reaction and show enhanced activity when alloyed with Re, Co, and Au."

[5] "PtCo catalysts have been shown to convert methane into C2+ products with higher conversion than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

[6] "PtNi supported on MgAl2O4 exhibits self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics. Without prereduction, the PtNi bimetallic catalyst dissociates CH4 under reaction conditions to form hydrogen, which spills over and reduces other metallic particles on the catalyst."

Pt-based bimetallic catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies:

1. CO Oxidation: Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, such as PtFe and PtNi, show improved performance compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The bimetallic surface structures can be reversibly controlled, leading to tunable catalytic activity. PtFe catalysts, for example, outperform Pt alone in preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO.

2. Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction: Pt-based bimetallic catalysts alloyed with Re, Co, or Au demonstrate enhanced activity for the WGS reaction compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The alloyed metal and dispersion play crucial roles in the activity.

3. Methane Conversions: PtCo catalysts show higher conversion of methane to C2+ products than monometallic catalysts. PtNi catalysts exhibit self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics in methane steam reforming, dissociating CH4 to form hydrogen which then reduces other metallic particles on the catalyst.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by:

1. Correlating the performance of model surfaces with supported catalysts.
2. Investigating the atomic-scale mechanisms of these reactions on well-defined bimetallic surfaces.
3. Studying the reversible structural changes observed in reactor studies under controlled UHV conditions.
4. Examining the role of surface composition and structure in catalytic activity and selectivity.

These UHV studies could help bridge the gap between idealized model systems and practical catalysts, potentially leading to the design of more efficient and selective bimetallic catalysts for industrial applications.

基于铂的双金属催化剂在反应器研究中显著影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机理和效率：

1. CO氧化：基于铂的双金属催化剂，如PtFe和PtNi，比单金属Pt催化剂表现更好。双金属表面结构可以可逆控制，导致可调的催化活性。例如，PtFe催化剂在CO的优先氧化（PROX）中优于单独的Pt。

2. 水煤气变换（WGS）反应：与Re、Co或Au合金的基于铂的双金属催化剂与单金属Pt催化剂相比，表现出增强的WGS反应活性。合金金属和分散度在活性中起着关键作用。

3. 甲烷转化：PtCo催化剂在将甲烷转化为C2+产物方面显示出比单金属催化剂更高的转化率。PtNi催化剂在甲烷蒸汽重整中表现出自激活和自再生特性，在反应条件下解离CH4形成氢气，然后还原催化剂上的其他金属颗粒。

未来的UHV研究可能提供有价值的见解，通过：

1. 将模型表面的性能与负载型催化剂相关联。
2. 研究这些反应在定义明确的双金属表面上的原子尺度机理。
3. 在受控的UHV条件下研究反应器研究中观察到的可逆结构变化。
4. 检查表面组成和结构在催化活性和选择性中的作用。

这些UHV研究可以帮助弥合理想化模型系统和实际催化剂之间的差距，可能导致设计出更高效和选择性的双金属催化剂用于工业应用。
