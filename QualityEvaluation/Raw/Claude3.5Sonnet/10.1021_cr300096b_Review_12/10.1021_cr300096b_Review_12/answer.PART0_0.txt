[1] "At present there are few UHV studies of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. The overview will therefore focus primarily on reactor studies, with the anticipation that the intriguing properties of these catalysts would inspire future UHV studies to correlate model surfaces with supported catalysts."

[2] "PtFe/γ-Al2O3, PtFe2/γ-Al2O3, and PtFe3/γ-Al2O3 outperform Pt/γ-Al2O3 for the PROX of CO in a combined stream of CO and H2."

[3] "PtRe and PtCo exhibit a higher WGS activity than Pt, but PtMo, PtSn, and PtCu show a lower WGS activity."

[4] "PtCo catalysts have been shown to convert methane into C2+ products with higher conversion than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

[5] "PtNi supported on MgAl2O4 exhibits self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics. Without prereduction, the PtNi bimetallic catalyst dissociates CH4 under reaction conditions to form hydrogen, which spills over and reduces other metallic particles on the catalyst."

Pt-based bimetallic catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies:

For CO oxidation, PtFe bimetallic catalysts show superior performance compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. They exhibit higher CO conversion and improved selectivity in preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in hydrogen-rich streams.

In water gas shift reactions, PtRe and PtCo bimetallic catalysts demonstrate enhanced activity compared to monometallic Pt. However, some combinations like PtMo, PtSn, and PtCu show lower activity than Pt alone, indicating that the choice of secondary metal is crucial for improving catalytic performance.

For methane conversions, PtCo catalysts show higher efficiency in converting methane to C2+ products compared to monometallic catalysts. PtNi catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 exhibit unique self-activation and self-regeneration properties in methane steam reforming, dissociating CH4 to form hydrogen that further reduces other metallic particles on the catalyst.

These reactor studies provide valuable insights into the performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. However, there is a current limitation in UHV studies on these surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially bridge the gap between reactor studies and model surfaces, offering a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms at play. They could provide atomic-level insights into surface structures, adsorption properties, and reaction intermediates, which would help explain the enhanced performance observed in reactor studies. Additionally, UHV studies could elucidate the role of the secondary metal in modifying Pt's catalytic properties, potentially guiding the design of more efficient bimetallic catalysts for these important reactions.

基于铂的双金属催化剂在反应器研究中显著影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机理和效率：

对于CO氧化，PtFe双金属催化剂比单金属Pt催化剂表现出更优异的性能。它们在富氢气流中CO的优先氧化（PROX）反应中表现出更高的CO转化率和改进的选择性。

在水煤气变换反应中，PtRe和PtCo双金属催化剂与单金属Pt相比表现出增强的活性。然而，一些组合如PtMo、PtSn和PtCu显示出低于单一Pt的活性，这表明第二种金属的选择对于提高催化性能至关重要。

对于甲烷转化，PtCo催化剂在将甲烷转化为C2+产物方面表现出比单金属催化剂更高的效率。在MgAl2O4上负载的PtNi催化剂在甲烷蒸汽重整中表现出独特的自激活和自再生特性，能在反应条件下解离CH4形成氢气，这种氢气进一步还原催化剂上的其他金属颗粒。

这些反应器研究为基于铂的双金属催化剂的性能提供了宝贵的见解。然而，目前在这些表面上的UHV研究还很有限。未来的UHV研究可能会弥合反应器研究和模型表面之间的差距，提供对基本机制更深入的理解。它们可以提供表面结构、吸附性质和反应中间体的原子级洞察，这将有助于解释在反应器研究中观察到的增强性能。此外，UHV研究可以阐明第二种金属在修饰Pt催化性能中的作用，可能指导设计更高效的双金属催化剂用于这些重要反应。
