[1] "At present there are few UHV studies of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. The overview will therefore focus primarily on reactor studies, with the anticipation that the intriguing properties of these catalysts would inspire future UHV studies to correlate model surfaces with supported catalysts."

[2] "The oxidation of CO is also studied on Fe/Pt(111), with the bimetallic surface structures being reversibly controlled between FeO/Pt(111) and subsurface PtFePt(111) via alternating oxidation and reduction treatments."

[3] "PtFe/γ-Al2O3, PtFe2/γ-Al2O3, and PtFe3/γ-Al2O3 outperform Pt/γ-Al2O3 for the PROX of CO in a combined stream of CO and H2."

[4] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are active for the WGS reaction and show enhanced activity when alloyed with Re, Co, and Au."

[5] "PtCo catalysts have been shown to convert methane into C2+ products with higher conversion than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

[6] "PtNi supported on MgAl2O4 exhibits self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics. Without prereduction, the PtNi bimetallic catalyst dissociates CH4 under reaction conditions to form hydrogen, which spills over and reduces other metallic particles on the catalyst."

Pt-based bimetallic catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies:

1. CO Oxidation: Bimetallic catalysts like PtFe and PtNi show enhanced activity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The bimetallic surface structures can be reversibly controlled, leading to tunable catalytic activity. PtFe catalysts outperform Pt alone for preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in hydrogen streams.

2. Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction: Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly when alloyed with Re, Co, or Au, demonstrate enhanced activity for WGS compared to monometallic Pt. The alloyed metal and dispersion play crucial roles in the catalytic activity.

3. Methane Conversions: PtCo catalysts show higher conversion of methane to C2+ products compared to monometallic catalysts. PtNi catalysts exhibit self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics in methane steam reforming, dissociating CH4 to form hydrogen which then reduces other metallic particles on the catalyst.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by:

1. Correlating the observed reactor performance with atomic-scale surface structures and compositions.
2. Investigating the reversible structural changes observed in reactor studies under controlled UHV conditions.
3. Exploring the role of support materials and their interactions with bimetallic particles in model systems.
4. Studying the formation and stability of specific active sites, such as metal-oxide interfaces or subsurface alloy structures, under reaction-like conditions.

These UHV studies could bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the enhanced performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts in these important reactions.

铂基双金属催化剂在反应器研究中显著影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机理和效率：

1. CO氧化：像PtFe和PtNi这样的双金属催化剂比单金属Pt催化剂表现出更高的活性。双金属表面结构可以可逆控制，从而导致可调节的催化活性。在含氢气流中，PtFe催化剂在CO优先氧化（PROX）方面的性能优于单一Pt。

2. 水煤气变换（WGS）反应：铂基双金属催化剂，特别是与Re、Co或Au合金时，与单金属Pt相比，在WGS反应中表现出更高的活性。合金金属和分散度在催化活性中起着关键作用。

3. 甲烷转化：与单金属催化剂相比，PtCo催化剂在将甲烷转化为C2+产物方面表现出更高的转化率。在甲烷蒸汽重整中，PtNi催化剂表现出自激活和自再生特性，在反应条件下解离CH4形成氢气，然后还原催化剂上的其他金属颗粒。

未来的UHV研究可以提供宝贵的见解：

1. 将观察到的反应器性能与原子尺度表面结构和成分相关联。
2. 在受控的UHV条件下研究反应器研究中观察到的可逆结构变化。
3. 在模型系统中探索载体材料及其与双金属颗粒的相互作用的作用。
4. 研究特定活性位点（如金属-氧化物界面或亚表面合金结构）在类似反应条件下的形成和稳定性。

这些UHV研究可以弥合模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距，为深入理解铂基双金属催化剂在这些重要反应中增强性能的基本机理提供基础。
