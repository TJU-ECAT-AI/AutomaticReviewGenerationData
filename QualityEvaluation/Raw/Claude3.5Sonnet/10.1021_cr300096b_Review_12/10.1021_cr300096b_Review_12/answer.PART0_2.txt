[1] "At present there are few UHV studies of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. The overview will therefore focus primarily on reactor studies, with the anticipation that the intriguing properties of these catalysts would inspire future UHV studies to correlate model surfaces with supported catalysts."

[2] "The oxidation of CO is also studied on Fe/Pt(111), with the bimetallic surface structures being reversibly controlled between FeO/Pt(111) and subsurface PtFePt(111) via alternating oxidation and reduction treatments."

[3] "PtFe/γ-Al2O3, PtFe2/γ-Al2O3, and PtFe3/γ-Al2O3 outperform Pt/γ-Al2O3 for the PROX of CO in a combined stream of CO and H2."

[4] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are active for the WGS reaction and show enhanced activity when alloyed with Re, Co, and Au."

[5] "PtCo catalysts have been shown to convert methane into C2+ products with higher conversion than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

[6] "PtNi supported on MgAl2O4 exhibits self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics. Without prereduction, the PtNi bimetallic catalyst dissociates CH4 under reaction conditions to form hydrogen, which spills over and reduces other metallic particles on the catalyst."

Pt-based bimetallic catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies:

1. CO Oxidation: Bimetallic catalysts like PtFe and PtNi show enhanced activity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The surface structures can be reversibly controlled between oxide overlayers and subsurface alloys, leading to tunable reactivity. PtFe catalysts outperform Pt for preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in H2 streams.

2. Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction: Pt-based bimetallic catalysts alloyed with Re, Co, and Au demonstrate enhanced WGS activity. The alloyed metal and dispersion play crucial roles in the catalytic activity.

3. Methane Conversions: PtCo catalysts show higher conversion of methane to C2+ products than monometallic catalysts. PtNi catalysts exhibit self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics in methane steam reforming, preventing deactivation and improving catalyst longevity.

Future UHV studies could provide insights into:

1. The precise surface structures and compositions that lead to enhanced reactivity in these reactions.
2. The mechanisms of reversible surface restructuring observed in reactor studies.
3. The nature of active sites and how they differ between model surfaces and supported catalysts.
4. The role of support materials in influencing catalytic activity, which is often crucial in reactor studies but absent in UHV experiments.
5. The effects of reaction conditions (pressure, temperature) on surface composition and structure, bridging the gap between UHV and reactor conditions.

These UHV studies would help establish structure-function relationships, validate proposed reaction mechanisms, and guide the rational design of more efficient catalysts for industrial applications.

基于铂的双金属催化剂在反应器研究中显著影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机理和效率：

1. CO氧化：像PtFe和PtNi这样的双金属催化剂比单金属Pt催化剂表现出更高的活性。表面结构可以在氧化物覆盖层和亚表面合金之间可逆控制，导致可调节的反应性。PtFe催化剂在H2流中的CO优先氧化（PROX）方面优于Pt。

2. 水煤气变换（WGS）反应：与Re、Co和Au合金化的基于Pt的双金属催化剂表现出增强的WGS活性。合金化金属和分散度在催化活性中起着关键作用。

3. 甲烷转化：PtCo催化剂在将甲烷转化为C2+产物方面表现出比单金属催化剂更高的转化率。PtNi催化剂在甲烷蒸汽重整中表现出自激活和自再生特性，防止失活并提高催化剂寿命。

未来的UHV研究可能提供以下见解：

1. 导致这些反应中反应性增强的精确表面结构和成分。
2. 反应器研究中观察到的可逆表面重构机制。
3. 活性位点的性质以及它们在模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差异。
4. 支撑材料在影响催化活性中的作用，这在反应器研究中通常很重要，但在UHV实验中缺失。
5. 反应条件（压力、温度）对表面成分和结构的影响，bridging UHV和反应器条件之间的差距。

这些UHV研究将有助于建立结构-功能关系，验证提出的反应机理，并指导更高效工业应用催化剂的合理设计。
