This question cannot be answered based on the given literature. The provided text does not contain any information about bimetallic catalysts, Pt-based catalysts, CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, methane conversions, or UHV studies. The literature focuses on Au/Co/Fe triple-layered core-shell nanoparticles and their catalytic activity for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane, which is unrelated to the question asked.
