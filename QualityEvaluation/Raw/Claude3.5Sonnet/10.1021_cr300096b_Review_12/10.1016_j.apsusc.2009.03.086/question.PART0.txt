1. Introduction
A solid catalyst is a complex dynamic system, which may
change its surface morphology, structure, and chemical composi-
tion under reaction conditions [16]. The dynamic behaviors in
heterogeneous
catalyst
systems
are
closely
correlated
with
reaction gas composition. Oxidizing and reducing atmospheres
are the most frequently encountered reaction environments in
many industrial reaction processes, such as partial oxidation
reactions
and
hydrogenation
reactions.
Reversible
dynamic
behaviors have been observed in many catalyst systems in
response to cycling between oxidizing and reducing gases.
In an intelligent catalyst LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3, Pd reversibly
moves into and out of the perovskite oxide lattice as the catalyst is
cycled between oxidative and reductive atmospheres. High-Pd
dispersion is retained in long-term automotive emission control
process, preventing the aggregation of Pd catalysts and deteriora-
tion of the catalyst activity [1,2]. Supported Cu nanocrystals were
found to undergo dynamic and reversible shape changes, i.e.
wettingnonwetting, when the Cu/ZnO catalysts were subject to
change in redox potential of the reaction gases [35]. Recently, the
similar reversible shape changes of Rh nanoparticles supported on
MgO(0 0 1) were revealed by in situ high-resolution X-ray
diffraction during oxidation and reduction cycles [6]. Strong
metalsupport interaction (SMSI) effect often occurs in metal/
oxide catalyst systems owing to encapsulation of metal catalysts
by oxide supports [713]. The SMSI effect or the encapsulation
process has been found to be reversible. Catalysts in the SMSI state
formed under reduction conditions can be regenerated via
oxidation treatments [9,14]. Oxide catalysts also demonstrate
reversible dynamic changes at reaction gases. For example, Netzer
et al. reported the morphology and structure oscillations of
vanadium oxide surface phase grown on Pd(1 1 1) upon oxida-
tionreduction in O2 and H2 [15]. These dynamic behaviors at
catalyst surfaces indicate that the surface state of catalytic
materials varies sensitively with the redox potential of the
reaction gases.
Bimetallic catalysts have been used in many important
industrial processes, such as fuel cells and catalytic reforming
reactions [1619]. Compared to monometallic catalysts, the
bimetallic catalysts present more structural complexity, where
the two components could have various structural configurations.
For example, bimetallic nanoparticles could have the structures of
alloy, coreshell, and linked monometallic nanoparticles [19]. In
bimetallic model systems consisting of one metal overlayers
grown on another metal single crystal, the second metal can be on
the topmost surface, in the subsurface region, or in the bulk of the
first metal crystal [16]. Furthermore, reaction gases and/or
temperature effects could induce interdiffusion between the two
components and even change chemical sate of the metals.
Therefore, complex dynamic processes are expected to occur in
the bimetallic catalyst systems under reaction conditions. Under-
standing and controlling the surface state of the bimetallic
catalysts is of great importance for many industrial reactions.

The surface states of supported PtNi nanoparticles treated at alternating O2 and H2 atmosphere were
studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Reversible structural changes at the surfaces of the
supported PtNi nanoparticles in response to reaction gases were observed, showing NiO-rich surface in
oxidizing gases and Pt-rich surface in reducing gases. The dynamic behaviors can be attributed to two
opposite gas-driven mass transport processes at bimetallic particle surfaces, including surface
segregation of Pt at the bimetallic particles in H2 and encapsulation of the particles by NiO in O2.
The similar surface structural changes can be observed in other bimetallic catalyst systems, as
exemplified in supported PtCu and PtCo nanoparticles.

In the present work, supported Pt-3d transition metals (PtM,
M = Co, Ni, and Cu) bimetallic nanoparticles were treated at
alternating oxidation and reduction atmospheres. The surface
structure and composition were studied by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM). It has been shown that the surface
structures of PtNi, as well as PtCo and PtCu bimetallic catalysts
show
reversible
changes with the
redox
potential
of
the
environmental gas. The results illustrate that the surface structure
of bimetallic catalysts can be tuned via treatments in various
gases.
2. Experimental
For XPS experiments, PtM bimetallic nanoparticles were
deposited on highly orientated pyrolyitc graphite (HOPG) surfaces.
A two-step process was used to prepare the HOPG(0 0 0 1)
surfaces, which consists of Ar+ bombardment in ultrahigh vacuum
(UHV) (Ar partial pressure of 4  10-6 mbar, Ar+ energy of 2 keV,
ion flux of 3 mA) followed by annealing in air (500 8C, 2 min). This
process produces high-density surface nanopits with monolayer
depth, which act as anchoring sites for nucleation of metal
nanoparticles [20]. 20 mL ethanol solution of hexachloroplatinic
acid (H2PtCl66H2O) with the concentration of 2 mmol/L was
dropped onto the modified HOPG surface and then heated in
vacuum at 200 8C for 2 h (denoted as Pt/HOPG). Subsequently,
20 mL ethanol solution of 3d transitional metal nitrate salt with the
concentration of 8 mmol/L was dropped onto the Pt/HOPG surface
and dried in air. The resulted samples were denoted as PtM/HOPG.
XPS measurements were performed in a Leybold surface analysis
system, which consists of a main UHV analysis chamber and a
reaction cell. The Pt/HOPG and PtM/HOPG samples mounted onto a
tantalum sample holder were put in the reaction cell, where the
sample temperature can be ramped up to 700 8C at various gaseous
atmospheres. Cycled oxidation and reduction of the Pt/HOPG and
PtM/HOPG samples were performed in the reaction cell with
flowing O2 and H2 gases (0.1 MPa). After each reaction, the sample
was sent to the main UHV chamber for XPS analysis without
exposing to air. XPS data were acquired using Mg Ka radiation
(1253.6 eV) with a power of 200 W and pass energy of 50 eV. All

the binding energy values were calibrated with the C 1s peak
position from HOPG surface at 284.5 eV.
Pt and PtNi catalysts supported on carbon black (CB, Alfa Aesar)
were prepared by the conventional wetness impregnation method
for the HRTEM investigations. Pt loading was 4 wt.% and Ni loading
was 4.8 wt.%. TEM images were acquired using Tecnai G2 F30 S-
Twin TEM operating at 300 kV.
3. Results and discussion
The as-prepared PtNi/HOPG samples were mildly reduced (20%
H2 with Ar balance, 200 8C, 2 h) to decompose the precursor salts
and remove any adsorbates from the catalysts. XPS measurement
shows that both Pt and Ni have been completely reduced and no
more Cl and N signals were detected. The clean PtNi catalysts were
then treated in alternating O2 (0.1 MPa) and H2 (0.1 MPa, 20% H2
with Ar balance) atmospheres at 300 8C for 1 h, and XPS
measurement was performed in between. After the first oxidation
(O2(1) as noted in Fig. 1a and b), the main peak of XPS Pt 4f7/2 still
locates at 71.2 eV, being characteristic of the metallic Pt. However,
the Pt 4f spectrum becomes asymmetric with a small shoulder
peak at higher binding energy (BE). Deconvolution of the spectrum
results in a new small component at 72.4 eV, which is due to
appearance of Pt2+. The main peak of Ni 2p3/2 is at 853.9 eV and a
strong shake-up feature at 860.9 eV appears, which suggest the
formation of NiO at the oxidation atmosphere [21]. Subsequent
reduction in H2 (H2(1) in Fig. 1a and b) shifts the Ni 2p3/2 peak
down to 852.6 eV for the metallic Ni state. The Pt 4f peak position
remains unchanged but the line shape becomes narrow. On the
other hand, the intensity of the Pt 4f and Ni 2p signals varies largely
with the annealing treatments. The Pt 4f peak area increases but
the Ni 2p signal is significantly weakened when the oxidized
catalyst has been reduced (Fig. 1a and b).
The oxidation and reduction treatments of the bimetallic PtNi
particles were repeated for five cycles, and updown oscillations in
the Ni 2p and Pt 4f intensity as a result of the alternating exposure
to O2 and H2 were seen (Fig. 1a and b). The reversible behavior can
be more clearly demonstrated when plotting the ratio of Ni 2p to Pt
4f intensity with the oxidation and reduction experimental cycles
(Fig. 1c). Furthermore, the chemical state of Ni reversibly switches
between Ni2+ and Ni0+ during the experimental cycles while Pt
remains almost metallic after all the treatments.
It is known that wetting and/or dewetting may take place when
annealing supported metal particles in gases [36], which could
cause variation in XPS signal intensity. To study this effect, a Pt/
HOPG sample was cycled with the same oxidation and reduction
treatments. Pt 4f spectra were acquired after each annealing step.
As displayed in Fig. 2, the Pt 4f intensity almost keeps unchanged in
the three oxidationreduction cycles, which is in stark contrast to
the case of PtNi catalyst systems (see Fig. 1a). The results
demonstrate that annealing supported Pt nanoparticles in O2 or
H2 at 300 8C does not produce any strong shape changes.
Considering that the cohesive energy of PtNi (5.52 eV) is similar
to that of PtPt (5.77 eV) [22], sintering of PtNi particles should
behave like that of Pt particles. The above conclusion derived from
supported Pt particles applies to the supported PtNi particles as
well. Therefore, the oscillations in Pt and Ni XPS signals observed in
the PtNi/HOPG catalysts should not be from the reversible shape
changes in the PtNi nanoparticles.
Furthermore, structural information of the supported PtNi
particles was given through TEM investigations. The PtNi particles
supported on CB present size ranging from 5 to 20 nm. HRTEM

imaging of individual particles indicates the formation of PtNi alloy
phase. As shown in Fig. 3, the (1 1 1) atomic planes of the PtNi alloy
lattice with a d-spacing of 0.216 nm can be clearly distinguished.
For comparison, a HRTEM image recorded from a Pt/CB sample
shows the Pt lattice with a d-spacing of 0.228 nm. The TEM results
confirmed the formation of bimetallic structure in the supported
PtNi particles. Moreover, XPS experiments show that Ni stays at
oxidized state after reducing a Ni/HOPG sample in H2 at 200 8C for
2 h but Ni in the PtNi/HOPG sample has been fully reduced under
the same treatment conditions. The feasible reduction of Ni in PtNi
particles should be attributed to H spillover from neighboring Pt
atoms [23], which also supports the bimetallic structure in the
supported PtNi particles.
Based on the above results and discussions, we suggest that the
observed changes in XPS Pt and Ni signals from the PtNi particles
during oxidation and reduction cycles should be attributed to
certain surface processes at the bimetallic particles. Surface
segregation has been often observed in many bimetallic surfaces.
Under vacuum conditions, the surface segregation of a metal with
larger atomic radius is preferred in order to release strain at the
bimetallic surface. The surface segregation of Pt has been found in
Pt-based bimetallic systems, such as PtCu [24], PtNi [17,2528],
PtFe [29,30], and PtCo [29,31]. The much larger atomic radius of Pt
(1.39 A
 ) than those of Co (1.25 A
 ), Ni (1.24 A
 ), and Cu (1.28 A
 ) [32]
contributes to the surface segregation process. Since hydrogen
bonds weakly to most 3d transition metals, presence of H2 will not
change the thermodynamic driving force for the surface segrega-
tion process. Therefore, it can be inferred that the segregation of Pt
onto surface may take place in the supported PtNi nanoparticles
upon annealing in H2 ambience, which strengthens Pt XPS signals
but weakens Ni XPS intensity (Fig. 1).
The stability of PtM catalysts may change significantly when
the atmosphere is switched from H2 to O2. Previous theoretical and
experimental works have shown that adsorption of oxygen on Pt
M catalyst surfaces could induce segregation of 3d transition
metals onto the top surface owing to strong bonding between
oxygen and 3d transition metals [16,33,34]. Moreover, the 3d
transition metals may become oxidized in the oxidative environ-
ments. Due to the low surface energy of most oxides (<1 J/m2) [35
37], the formed 3d transition metal oxides tend to encapsulate Pt
surfaces (surface energy of Pt: 1.95 J/m2 [38]). As we have seen that
Ni was oxidized to NiO in case of oxidation of the PtNi catalyst at
300 8C (Fig. 1b). Due to the lower surface energy of NiO than Pt and
the strong interaction between NiO and Pt [8,9,39,40], the formed

NiO should encapsulate Pt surfaces at this temperature. Therefore,
the Pt 4f signals are substantially attenuated but the Ni 2p XPS
peak area increases (Fig. 1).
Based on the discussion, we suggest the following dynamic
process at the PtNi nanoparticle surfaces upon the cycled oxidation
and reduction treatments (Scheme 1). The treatment in H2 at
300 8C reduces Pt and Ni components to metallic state. Pt tends to
segregate to outer surfaces of PtNi nanoparticles and Pt-skin
structure forms, which is driven by minimization of the strain
energy. Exposure of the PtNi nanoparticles to O2 at 300 8C,
however, drives the outward diffusion of Ni to the surfaces and
oxidizes Ni to NiO. Strong metaloxide interaction and reduction in
surface energy induces encapsulation of Pt with NiO overlayers.
The mass transport processes, which are active in the oxidation or
reduction reactions, are fully reversible depending on the redox
potential of the reaction gases.
The cyclic oxidation and reduction treatments followed by XPS
measurements were also conducted in PtCu and PtCo bimetallic
catalysts. The similar reversible dynamic behaviors have been
observed in PtCu/HOPG (Fig. 4) and PtCo/HOPG (Fig. 5) systems. In
the PtCu/HOPG catalyst, Cu becomes oxidized to CuO as indicated
by the appearance of Cu 2p3/2 spectra peaked at 933.7 eV and the
L3M4.5M4.5 auger peak at 918.0 eV (not shown here) after the
oxidation. The subsequent annealing in H2 reduces it to metallic Cu
with the Cu 2p3/2 BE at 932.4 eV [21]. The reversible change in Cu
chemical state was simultaneously accompanied by variation in
Scheme 1. The reversible change in surface structure of Pt-3d transition metal nanoparticles in cycled oxidation and reduction reactions.

XPS Cu 2p intensity, which increases in O2 but decreases in H2
atmosphere (Fig. 4b). XPS Pt 4f intensity shows the reverse
dependence on the reaction environment. It decreases in O2 but
increases in H2 (Fig. 4a). To calculate the ratio of Cu 2p to Pt 4f
intensity (Cu 2p/Pt 4f), XPS Cu 3p peak located at 7578 eV was
excluded for the calculation of Pt 4f area. The ratio of Cu 2p/Pt 4f
demonstrates significant updown oscillations with the O2/H2
cycles (Fig. 4c). Like the PtNi system, the oscillations in the Pt and
Cu XPS signals can be attributed to the reversible mass transport
processes in PtCu particles under reaction conditions. At reductive
atmosphere, Pt segregates to the particle surfaces due to the larger
atomic radius of Pt than Cu (1.39 A
 /Pt vs. 1.28 A
 /Cu) [32]. Exposure
to O2 causes outward diffusion of Cu and encapsulation of the
particles by the formed Cu oxide layer because of lower surface
energy of CuO than Pt.
Under the same oxidation conditions, Co in the PtCo catalysts
changes to Co3O4 with the Co 2p3/2 BE at 779.5 eV. In contrast, in
the H2 environment the resulted Co oxides were reduced to
metallic Co with Co 2p3/2 BE at 778.0 eV and CoO showing Co 2p3/2
BE around 780.4 eV and a shake-up peak at 786.7 eV [41].
Furthermore, Co 2p and Pt 4f signals also vary with the reaction
treatments (Fig. 5a and b). Co 2p/Pt 4f increases upon the oxidation
but decreases after the reduction (Fig. 5c). The oscillations suggest
that the reversible mass transport processes occurring at the PtNi
and PtCu nanoparticles also take place in the PtCo nanoparticles
driven by the same principle.
Most surface studies in the Pt-based bimetallic catalyst systems
have concentrated on single crystal model systems under UHV
conditions. As pointed by Chen et al., more systematic works have
to be performed using the bimetallic nanoparticle systems under
the reaction conditions in order to bridge the materials gap and
the pressure gap [16]. The preliminary results presented in this
contribution indicate that the principal processes governing
surface structural changes in bimetallic model catalyst systems
are actually active in the bimetallic nanoparticle systems at real
reaction conditions. The reversible structure changes in Pt-based
bimetallic catalyst systems are of great significance in many real
catalytic processes.
4. Conclusion
Reversible structural changes in PtNi nanoparticles have been
observed when annealing the bimetallic catalysts in alternating H2
and O2 atmospheres. Upon oxidation in O2 (0.1 MPa) at 300 8C, Ni
becomes oxidized and the formed NiO encapsulates the bimetallic
particles. Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance,
300 8C) both Pt and Ni stay as metallic. Pt segregates onto the
particle surfaces and Ni diffuses to subsurface region, which results
in the formation of Pt-skin structures. The reversible mass
transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2
contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition
at PtNi nanoparticle systems. The similar reversible dynamic
behaviors have been found in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts
supported HOPG.
