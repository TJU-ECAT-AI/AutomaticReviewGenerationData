[1] "Three main reactions take place in this system. The reaction that competes most effectively with CO oxidation [Eq.(1)] is H2 oxidation [Eq.(2)] because of the H2-rich conditions in the gas stream in practical fuel cell applications. In addition, CO can consume additional H2 by undergoing hydrogenation [Eq.(3)], a process also known as methanation, which should be avoided unless the CO concentration in the reactant stream is quite low, because it consumes relatively large amounts of hydrogen (3mol per mol CO)."

[2] "Herein, we report that a PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a H2-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K."

[3] "Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted to try to determine the interactions between Pt and Co, as well as those between Pt, Co oxides (CoOx), and YSZ (Figure2)."

[4] "In light of these results, the presence of bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles in contact with a reducible support having surface oxygen vacancies could be the reason for the high PROX activity of the PtCo/YSZ catalyst."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones like PtCo, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. These catalysts show enhanced performance in preferential CO oxidation (PROX) in hydrogen-rich streams, even at low temperatures and with small amounts of Pt.

The PtCo bimetallic catalysts supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) demonstrate high efficiency in PROX reactions below 423K. The presence of bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the reducible YSZ support, which has surface oxygen vacancies, is believed to be responsible for this high catalytic activity.

The study used temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) to investigate the interactions between Pt, Co, and the YSZ support, providing insights into the formation and behavior of the bimetallic phase. This technique revealed the presence of new bimetallic PtCo oxides and their reduction at lower temperatures compared to monometallic catalysts.

While this study provides valuable information on the performance and characteristics of PtCo bimetallic catalysts in reactor studies, it does not directly address potential insights from UHV studies. Future UHV studies could potentially provide more detailed information on the atomic-scale interactions and surface chemistry of these bimetallic catalysts, which could help correlate the findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts. 

However, it's important to note that UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may face limitations in replicating the complex environment of real catalytic systems, particularly in terms of pressure and the presence of support materials. Therefore, bridging the gap between UHV studies and real catalytic conditions remains a challenge in this field of research.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的催化剂（如PtCo），在反应器研究中显著影响了CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机理和效率。这些催化剂在富氢气流中表现出优异的CO优先氧化（PROX）性能，即使在低温和铂含量较少的情况下也是如此。

以氧化钇稳定氧化锆（YSZ）为载体的PtCo双金属催化剂在423K以下的温度范围内表现出高效的PROX反应性能。双金属PtCo纳米粒子与具有表面氧空位的可还原YSZ载体之间的相互作用被认为是导致这种高催化活性的原因。

研究使用温度程序还原（TPR）技术来研究Pt、Co和YSZ载体之间的相互作用，从而深入了解双金属相的形成和行为。这种技术揭示了新的双金属PtCo氧化物的存在，以及它们相比单金属催化剂在更低温度下的还原过程。

虽然这项研究为反应器研究中PtCo双金属催化剂的性能和特性提供了宝贵的信息，但它并未直接涉及超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供的见解。未来的UHV研究可能会提供这些双金属催化剂原子尺度相互作用和表面化学的更详细信息，这可能有助于将反应器研究的发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联。

然而，需要注意的是，对铂基双金属表面的UHV研究在复制真实催化系统的复杂环境方面可能面临局限性，特别是在压力和载体材料存在的方面。因此，在这一研究领域中，弥合UHV研究与实际催化条件之间的差距仍然是一个挑战。
