[1] "Among a number of catalysts reported to be active for PROX, supported platinum catalysts have been considered to be promising in view of their high catalytic performance."

[2] "Many researchers have therefore made efforts to enhance the PROX activity of supported platinum catalysts at low temperatures, for example by water vapor pre-treatment of the Pt catalyst, the addition of alkali metals, and the addition of other metals."

[3] "Herein, we report that a PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a H2-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K."

[4] "The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity."

[5] "Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted to try to determine the interactions between Pt and Co, as well as those between Pt, Co oxides (CoOx), and YSZ"

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation in reactor studies. The addition of a second metal to Pt catalysts enhances their performance for preferential CO oxidation (PROX) at low temperatures. Specifically, PtCo bimetallic catalysts supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) show high efficiency for PROX in H2-rich streams, even with small amounts of Pt at temperatures below 423K.

The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support appears to be responsible for the high catalytic activity. The study used temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) to investigate the interactions between Pt, Co, and the YSZ support, providing insights into the nature of the active sites.

While this research focuses on reactor studies, future UHV studies could potentially provide valuable insights by allowing for more controlled investigations of the surface chemistry and structure of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. UHV studies could help elucidate the specific roles of the bimetallic nanoparticles and their interactions with the support at the atomic level. This could lead to a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the nature of the active sites, which is challenging to achieve in reactor studies alone.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces include difficulties in accurately replicating the complex structures and interactions present in supported catalysts under realistic reaction conditions. Bridging the gap between UHV studies and reactor studies remains a challenge, but combining insights from both approaches could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of these catalytic systems and guide the design of more efficient catalysts for CO oxidation and related reactions.

双金属催化剂，尤其是基于铂的催化剂，显著影响了反应器研究中一氧化碳氧化的机理和效率。向铂催化剂中添加第二种金属可以提高其在低温下进行优先一氧化碳氧化（PROX）的性能。具体而言，以氧化钇稳定的氧化锆（YSZ）为载体的PtCo双金属催化剂在富氢气流中表现出高效的PROX性能，即使在423K以下的温度和少量铂的情况下也是如此。

孤立的PtCo双金属纳米粒子与载体的相互作用似乎是导致高催化活性的原因。该研究使用程序升温还原（TPR）来研究铂、钴和YSZ载体之间的相互作用，从而深入了解活性位点的性质。

虽然这项研究主要集中在反应器研究上，但未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会提供宝贵的见解，因为它允许对基于铂的双金属催化剂的表面化学和结构进行更加受控的研究。UHV研究可以帮助阐明双金属纳米粒子的具体作用及其与载体在原子水平上的相互作用。这可能会带来对反应机理和活性位点性质的更好理解，而这在单纯的反应器研究中是难以实现的。

然而，目前在基于铂的双金属表面进行UHV研究的限制包括难以准确复制在实际反应条件下支持催化剂中存在的复杂结构和相互作用。弥合UHV研究和反应器研究之间的差距仍然是一个挑战，但结合两种方法的见解可能会导致对这些催化系统更全面的理解，并指导设计更高效的一氧化碳氧化和相关反应的催化剂。
