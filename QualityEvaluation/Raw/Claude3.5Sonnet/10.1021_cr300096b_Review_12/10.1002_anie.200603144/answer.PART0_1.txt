[1] "PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a H2-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K."

[2] "The addition of Co to Pt/YSZ resulted in a large enhancement in catalytic performance for PROX, especially in the temperature region below 423K."

[3] "The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity."

[4] "Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted to try to determine the interactions between Pt and Co, as well as those between Pt, Co oxides (CoOx), and YSZ"

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones like PtCo, significantly enhance the efficiency of CO oxidation in reactor studies. The addition of Co to Pt/YSZ catalysts greatly improves catalytic performance for preferential CO oxidation (PROX), especially at lower temperatures below 423K. This improved efficiency is attributed to the formation of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles that interact with the support material.

The mechanisms of these reactions are influenced by the interactions between Pt and Co, as well as between the metals, their oxides, and the support material. For CO oxidation specifically, the lattice oxygen and interfacial metal-support interaction play crucial roles when metal species are supported on an oxygen-ion-conducting support like YSZ.

While the current study provides valuable insights into reactor-based experiments, it does not directly address UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially provide more detailed information on the atomic-level interactions and reaction mechanisms occurring on these bimetallic surfaces. This could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering a more comprehensive understanding of how the bimetallic nature of these catalysts influences their performance in various reactions.

However, it's important to note that UHV studies on complex bimetallic surfaces like PtCo can be challenging due to the difficulty in preparing well-defined bimetallic surfaces under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Overcoming these limitations could provide valuable correlations between the findings from reactor studies and the behavior of model surfaces, potentially leading to more rational catalyst design.

双金属催化剂，特别是以Pt为基础的催化剂（如PtCo），在反应器研究中显著提高了CO氧化的效率。在Pt/YSZ催化剂中添加Co可以大大提高优先CO氧化（PROX）的催化性能，尤其是在423K以下的较低温度。这种效率的提高归因于形成了与支撑材料相互作用的孤立的双金属PtCo纳米粒子。

这些反应的机制受到Pt和Co之间的相互作用，以及金属、金属氧化物与支撑材料之间相互作用的影响。特别是对于CO氧化，当金属物种被支撑在氧离子导电支撑材料（如YSZ）上时，晶格氧和金属-支撑材料界面相互作用起着至关重要的作用。

虽然当前的研究为基于反应器的实验提供了有价值的见解，但并未直接涉及Pt基双金属表面的超高真空（UHV）研究。未来的UHV研究可能会提供这些双金属表面上原子级相互作用和反应机理的更详细信息。这可能有助于弥合模型表面和负载型催化剂之间的差距，提供更全面的理解，了解这些催化剂的双金属性质如何影响它们在各种反应中的性能。

然而，重要的是要注意，对PtCo这样复杂的双金属表面进行UHV研究可能具有挑战性，因为在超高真空条件下制备明确定义的双金属表面很困难。克服这些限制可能会提供反应器研究发现与模型表面行为之间的有价值的相关性，潜在地导致更合理的催化剂设计。
