          [1] "Modification of Pt/SiO2 with ReOx species enhanced the catalytic activity of the CO oxidation with O2 in the presence of H2."

          [2] "The promoting effect of Re species appeared after the reduction above 673 K."

          [3] "The reduced PtReOx/SiO2 (Re/Pt = 0.5) has high O2 activation ability even when the CO adsorption on the Pt surface atoms is saturated, and this property is caused by the reduced Re species."

          [4] "Under the PROX condition, the reduced state of Re species can be maintained by the presence of H2. The reduced ReOx species can activate O2, and the activated oxygen and oxidizing species are supplied from Re species to the Pt metal surface; as a result, the coverage of oxidizing species is increased and that of adsorbed CO is decreased."

          [5] "Characterization of the reduced PtReOx/SiO2 catalyst by means of EXAFS, XANES, temperature-programmed reduction, and CO adsorption measurements suggested the formation of the ReOx clusters on the surface of Pt metal particles with the average valence of Re of +2.7."

          [6] "These tendencies can be explained by the mechanism where the reduced ReOx species activates O2 and the oxidizing species is spilled over from the ReOx species to the Pt surface."

          The bimetallic Pt-Re catalyst significantly influences the mechanism and efficiency of CO oxidation in the presence of H2 (PROX reaction). Key findings include:

          1. Addition of ReOx to Pt/SiO2 enhances CO oxidation activity in the presence of H2.
          2. The promoting effect of Re species occurs after reduction above 673 K, resulting in the formation of ReOx clusters on Pt metal particles with an average Re valence of +2.7.
          3. Reduced PtReOx/SiO2 maintains high O2 activation ability even when CO adsorption on Pt is saturated, due to the reduced Re species.
          4. The mechanism involves activation of O2 by reduced ReOx species, followed by spillover of oxidizing species from ReOx to the Pt surface.
          5. H2 presence helps maintain the reduced state of Re under reaction conditions.

          The study does not provide specific information about water gas shift reaction or methane conversions for this catalyst system. 

          Regarding potential insights from future UHV studies, they could:
          1. Examine the surface structure and oxidation states of Pt-Re model surfaces.
          2. Investigate O2 activation and spillover processes on well-defined Pt-Re surfaces.
          3. Compare reactivity and adsorbate behaviors between model surfaces and supported catalysts.
          4. Study the influence of H2 on maintaining reduced Re species in controlled UHV environments.
          5. Provide atomic-level understanding of the synergistic effects observed in reactor studies.

          These UHV studies could help bridge the gap between reactor studies and fundamental surface science. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, such as maintaining the reduced state of Re species under UHV conditions, would need to be addressed to fully correlate with reactor studies.

          双金属Pt-Re催化剂显著影响了在H2存在下CO氧化(PROX反应)的机理和效率。主要发现包括：

          1. 向Pt/SiO2中添加ReOx可以在H2存在的情况下增强CO氧化活性。
          2. Re物种的促进作用在673 K以上还原后出现，导致在Pt金属颗粒表面形成ReOx簇，Re的平均价态为+2.7。
          3. 还原态PtReOx/SiO2即使在Pt上CO吸附饱和时仍保持高O2活化能力，这是由于还原态Re物种的存在。
          4. 机理涉及还原态ReOx物种激活O2，然后氧化物种从ReOx溢出到Pt表面。
          5. 在反应条件下，H2的存在有助于保持Re的还原状态。

          该研究没有提供关于这种催化剂系统的水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化的具体信息。

          关于未来UHV研究可能提供的见解，它们可以：
          1. 研究Pt-Re模型表面的表面结构和氧化态。
          2. 在定义明确的Pt-Re表面上研究O2活化和溢出过程。
          3. 比较模型表面和负载催化剂之间的反应性和吸附物行为。
          4. 在受控的UHV环境中研究H2对维持还原态Re物种的影响。
          5. 为反应器研究中观察到的协同效应提供原子级理解。

          这些UHV研究可以帮助弥合反应器研究和基础表面科学之间的差距。然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面UHV研究中的限制，如在UHV条件下维持Re物种还原态的困难，需要解决以充分与反应器研究相关联。
