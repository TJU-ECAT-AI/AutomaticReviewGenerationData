[1] "Modification of Pt/SiO2 with ReOx species enhanced the catalytic activity of the CO oxidation with O2 in the presence of H2."

[3] "The reduced PtReOx/SiO2 (Re/Pt = 0.5) has high O2 activation ability even when the CO adsorption on the Pt surface atoms is saturated, and this property is caused by the reduced Re species."

[4] "Under the PROX condition, the reduced state of Re species can be maintained by the presence of H2. The reduced ReOx species can activate O2, and the activated oxygen and oxidizing species are supplied from Re species to the Pt metal surface; as a result, the coverage of oxidizing species is increased and that of adsorbed CO is decreased."

The literature provides insights into how bimetallic Pt-Re catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies. The addition of ReOx species to Pt/SiO2 enhances catalytic activity for CO oxidation in the presence of H2. This promoting effect is observed after reduction above 673 K, indicating the importance of the catalyst's reduced state.

The reduced PtReOx catalyst demonstrates high O2 activation ability, even when CO is saturated on the Pt surface. This property is attributed to the reduced Re species. Under preferential oxidation (PROX) conditions, H2 maintains the reduced state of Re species. The reduced ReOx activates O2 and supplies activated oxygen and oxidizing species to the Pt surface, increasing the coverage of oxidizing species while decreasing adsorbed CO.

The literature does not provide specific information on water gas shift reactions or methane conversions for this catalyst system. Additionally, it does not discuss potential insights from UHV studies or correlations with model surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially provide more detailed information on the surface chemistry and interactions between Pt and Re species, which could help bridge the gap between supported catalysts and model surfaces. However, the current literature focuses on reactor studies and does not address the limitations of UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

该文献提供了关于双金属Pt-Re催化剂如何影响CO氧化机理和效率的见解。向Pt/SiO2中添加ReOx物种可以在存在H2的情况下提高CO氧化的催化活性。这种促进效应在673 K以上还原后观察到，表明催化剂还原状态的重要性。

还原的PtReOx催化剂表现出高O2活化能力，即使在Pt表面上CO饱和时也是如此。这一特性归因于还原态的Re物种。在优先氧化（PROX）条件下，H2维持Re物种的还原状态。还原的ReOx活化O2并向Pt表面供应活化氧和氧化物种，增加氧化物种的覆盖率，同时减少吸附的CO。

文献没有提供关于该催化剂系统的水气变换反应或甲烷转化的具体信息。此外，它也没有讨论超高真空（UHV）研究的潜在见解或与模型表面的相关性。未来的UHV研究可能会提供关于Pt和Re物种之间表面化学和相互作用的更详细信息，这可能有助于弥合负载型催化剂和模型表面之间的差距。然而，目前的文献主要关注反应器研究，并未涉及UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的局限性。
