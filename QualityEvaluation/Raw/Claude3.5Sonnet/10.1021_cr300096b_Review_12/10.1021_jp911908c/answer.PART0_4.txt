[1] "Modification of Pt/SiO2 with ReOx species enhanced the catalytic activity of the CO oxidation with O2 in the presence of H2."

[2] "The promoting effect of Re species appeared after the reduction above 673 K. Characterization of the reduced PtReOx/SiO2 catalyst by means of EXAFS, XANES, temperature-programmed reduction, and CO adsorption measurements suggested the formation of the ReOx clusters on the surface of Pt metal particles with the average valence of Re of +2.7."

[3] "These tendencies can be explained by the mechanism where the reduced ReOx species activates O2 and the oxidizing species is spilled over from the ReOx species to the Pt surface."

[4] "The reduced PtReOx/SiO2 (Re/Pt = 0.5) has high O2 activation ability even when the CO adsorption on the Pt surface atoms is saturated, and this property is caused by the reduced Re species. Under the PROX condition, the reduced state of Re species can be maintained by the presence of H2."

The study provides insights into how bimetallic Pt-Re catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in reactor studies:

1. The addition of ReOx to Pt/SiO2 enhances CO oxidation activity in the presence of H2.

2. The promoting effect of Re species occurs after reduction above 673 K, resulting in the formation of ReOx clusters on Pt metal particles with an average Re valence of +2.7.

3. The mechanism involves activation of O2 by reduced ReOx species, followed by spillover of oxidizing species from ReOx to the Pt surface.

4. Reduced PtReOx/SiO2 maintains high O2 activation ability even when CO adsorption on Pt is saturated, due to the reduced Re species. H2 presence helps maintain the reduced state of Re under reaction conditions.

The study does not directly address water gas shift or methane conversion reactions. It also does not discuss UHV studies or model surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights by:

1. Examining the surface structure and oxidation states of Pt-Re model surfaces.
2. Investigating O2 activation and spillover processes on well-defined Pt-Re surfaces.
3. Comparing reactivity and adsorbate behaviors between model surfaces and supported catalysts.
4. Studying the influence of H2 on maintaining reduced Re species in controlled UHV environments.

Such UHV studies could help bridge the gap between reactor studies and fundamental surface science, providing atomic-level understanding of the promoting effects observed in this reactor-based study.

这项研究为双金属Pt-Re催化剂如何影响反应器研究中的CO氧化机理和效率提供了见解：

1. 在Pt/SiO2中添加ReOx可以提高存在H2情况下的CO氧化活性。

2. Re物种的促进作用在673 K以上还原后出现，导致在Pt金属颗粒表面形成ReOx簇，Re的平均价态为+2.7。

3. 机理涉及还原态ReOx物种激活O2，然后氧化物种从ReOx溢出到Pt表面。

4. 还原态PtReOx/SiO2即使在Pt上CO吸附饱和时仍保持高O2活化能力，这是由于还原态Re物种的存在。在反应条件下，H2的存在有助于保持Re的还原状态。

该研究没有直接涉及水煤气变换或甲烷转化反应。也没有讨论超高真空(UHV)研究或模型表面。未来的UHV研究可能通过以下方式提供见解：

1. 研究Pt-Re模型表面的表面结构和氧化态。
2. 在定义明确的Pt-Re表面上研究O2活化和溢出过程。
3. 比较模型表面和负载催化剂之间的反应性和吸附物行为。
4. 在受控的UHV环境中研究H2对维持还原态Re物种的影响。

这些UHV研究可以帮助弥合反应器研究和基础表面科学之间的差距，为该反应器基础研究中观察到的促进效应提供原子级理解。
