[1] "Modification of Pt/SiO2 with ReOx species enhanced the catalytic activity of the CO oxidation with O2 in the presence of H2."

[2] "The promoting effect of Re species appeared after the reduction above 673 K."

[3] "The reduced PtReOx/SiO2 (Re/Pt = 0.5) has high O2 activation ability even when the CO adsorption on the Pt surface atoms is saturated, and this property is caused by the reduced Re species."

[4] "Under the PROX condition, the reduced state of Re species can be maintained by the presence of H2. The reduced ReOx species can activate O2, and the activated oxygen and oxidizing species are supplied from Re species to the Pt metal surface; as a result, the coverage of oxidizing species is increased and that of adsorbed CO is decreased."

The bimetallic PtReOx/SiO2 catalyst significantly influences the mechanism and efficiency of CO oxidation in the presence of H2 (PROX reaction). The addition of Re species to Pt/SiO2 enhances catalytic activity by promoting O2 activation, even when CO is saturated on the Pt surface. This is due to the reduced Re species, which are maintained in a reduced state by H2. The reduced ReOx activates O2 and supplies activated oxygen to the Pt surface, increasing oxidizing species coverage and decreasing CO coverage.

The literature does not provide specific information about the water gas shift reaction or methane conversions for this catalyst. However, it does mention that the contribution of the water gas shift reaction in the PROX reaction is very small for both Pt/SiO2 and PtReOx/SiO2 catalysts.

Regarding potential insights from future UHV studies, they could help correlate these findings with model surfaces by:

1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of PtRe bimetallic surfaces under various conditions.
2. Studying the adsorption and activation of O2 on reduced Re species in a controlled environment.
3. Examining the spillover mechanism of activated oxygen from Re to Pt sites.
4. Analyzing the interaction between CO and the bimetallic surface at different coverages and temperatures.

These UHV studies could provide atomic-level insights into the synergistic effects observed in reactor studies, helping to bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, such as the difficulty in maintaining the reduced state of Re species under UHV conditions, would need to be addressed to fully correlate with the reactor studies.

双金属PtReOx/SiO2催化剂显著影响了在H2存在下CO氧化(PROX反应)的机理和效率。向Pt/SiO2中添加Re物种通过促进O2活化来增强催化活性，即使在CO饱和Pt表面时也是如此。这是由于还原态的Re物种，它们在H2的作用下保持还原态。还原态的ReOx活化O2并向Pt表面供应活化氧，增加氧化物种覆盖率并降低CO覆盖率。

文献没有提供关于这种催化剂的水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化的具体信息。然而，它确实提到在PROX反应中，Pt/SiO2和PtReOx/SiO2催化剂的水煤气变换反应贡献很小。

关于未来UHV研究可能提供的见解，它们可以通过以下方式帮助将这些发现与模型表面相关联：

1. 研究各种条件下PtRe双金属表面的表面结构和组成。
2. 在受控环境中研究还原态Re物种上O2的吸附和活化。
3. 检查活化氧从Re到Pt位点的溢出机制。
4. 分析不同覆盖率和温度下CO与双金属表面的相互作用。

这些UHV研究可以提供反应器研究中观察到的协同效应的原子级见解，有助于弥合模型表面和负载型催化剂之间的差距。然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面UHV研究中的限制，如在UHV条件下维持Re物种还原态的困难，需要解决以充分与反应器研究相关联。
