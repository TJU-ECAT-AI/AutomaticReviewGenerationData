Improved Pt-Ni nanocatalysts for dry reforming of methane
Abstract
Nanostructured PtNi catalysts, prepared by the reverse microemulsion method (ME) and supported on a nanofibrous alumina were studied for the CO2-reforming of methane. Monometallic (Ni and Pt) and bimetallic (PtNi) supported catalysts were synthesized, characterized (XRD, TEM, Elemental Analysis, Raman, XPS and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)) and tested under CO2-reforming reaction conditions. Catalysts prepared by wetness impregnation (IM) of the support were also synthesized for comparative purposes. Characterization results showed that Pt addition and the preparation of the catalysts by ME promoted the formation of NiO, instead of NiAl2O4, and facilitated its reduction to Ni0 during the catalysts pre-treatment. It was also observed that the Ni and Pt ensembles were modified when the catalysts were prepared by the reverse microemulsion method, reducing the global carbon formation. From activity tests it can be concluded that catalysts prepared by the reverse microemulsion method are less sensitive to coke deposition and more stable under CO2-reforming conditions. Besides, in the bimetallic catalysts, there is a Pt-Ni interaction between metallic centers, which enhances the catalyst stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO.

Pt-Ni nanocatalysts prepared by the reverse microemulsion method and supported on a nanofibrous alumina were studied for the CO2 reforming of methane. Preparing the catalysts by microemulsion inhibits global carbon formation, promotes the relative content of active species and avoids metal sintering, as well as improves considerably the catalysts stability.

1. Introduction
Catalytic reforming of methane with CO2 seems to be a promising technology to produce syngas, using two greenhouse gases (CH4 and CO2). The dry reforming of methane (DRM) provides low H2/CO ratios desirable for the synthesis of valuable oxygenated chemicals

The industrial practices rely on Ni-based catalysts, because of their cost and availability in comparison with other metals. Unfortunately, under reforming conditions, Ni catalysts tend to sinter and form unreactive carbon which blocks catalyst pores and active sites, leading to catalyst deactivation
[3]
,
[9]
,
[10]
,
[11]
. Although, carbon formation can be inhibited controlling the reaction kinetically by using adequate catalysts and supports. Therefore, efforts should be directed to develop efficient Ni-based catalyst with high activity and stability, with reduced Ni sintering and carbon formation
[3]
,
[7]
.
It has been reported that carbon deposition depends on the catalyst surface structure. Thus, by controlling the size of the metal ensembles it is possible to control the carbon formation
[12]
. Moreover, the metal dispersion and metalsupport interaction are related to different aspects as the preparation procedure of the catalysts, the support employed and the catalytic pre-treatment. It is well established that an adequate preparation method can considerably improve the metal disposition over the support as well as its contact, which consequently affects the catalytic performance. The reverse microemulsion method has proved to be an effective procedure to synthesize supported and unsupported catalysts with a high control of the composition and the metal dispersion, on the nanometer level

prepared by the microemulsion method a high stable and coking resistant Ni/Al2O3 catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane. Besides, the superficial characteristics and the morphology of the support influence the metalsupport interaction, affecting the metal dispersion and reducibility, as well as the catalytic activity and stability
[15]
. Previous studies indicate that using a nanofibrous alumina as support for monometallic and bimetallic PtNi catalysts allows systems with homogeneous and stable metallic particles
[15]
,
[16]
.
Additionally, it is well known that noble metals inhibit coke formation and the carbon obtained differs in nature from that formed over Ni catalysts. Moreover, it has been reported that a small amount of noble metals can promote the reducibility of the base metal, such as Ni, and stabilize its degree of reduction during the catalytic process
[17]
,
[18]
,
[19]
.
In previous works, the influence of using a nanofibrous alumina as support for Ni and Pt catalysts for the DRM, as well as the addition of Pt to Ni-based catalysts, has been studied
[15]
,
[16]
. This nanofibrous alumina has proved to be a promising support, allowing highly stable and active systems. The aim of the present work is to develop stable Ni and Pt based catalysts with resistance to coke deposition and good performance under reforming conditions. The influence of the preparation method on monometallic and bimetallic PtNi catalysts, supported on a nanofibrous alumina, was studied. The support and catalysts were characterized by conventional methods. For all the catalysts the catalytic activity and stability were evaluated under DRM conditions at steady state.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
A synthesized nanofibrous γ-Al2O3 was employed as support. The nanoestructured alumina was prepared using NaAlO2 as precursor, as is reported in
[20]
. Some modifications to the original synthesis were included. In detail, an aqueous NaAlO2 solution was added dropwise to 5N acetic acid solution. The precipitate obtained was decanted, filtered and washed with water. The white powder was dried overnight at 100 C and subsequently mixed with a non-ionic surfactant (Tergitol 15-TS-5, Sigma) using a Tergitol/Al ratio of 0.5. The mixture was autoclaved for 72 h at 100 C and later calcined at 500 C for 20 h. Before the catalysts preparation, the support was calcined in air at 800 C for 2 h (10 C/min).
Monometallic (Pt [0.4 at/nm2] and Ni [4 at/nm2]; denoted as 0.4Pt/Al2O3 ME and 4Ni/Al2O3 ME) and bimetallic (Pt [0.04 at/nm2]-Ni [4 at/nm2]; denoted as 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME), supported catalysts were prepared by the reverse microemulsion method (ME). The reverse microemulsion was prepared by mixing, under continuous stirring, two different reverse micelle solutions; one solution containing the reductant agent (N2H4, Fluka) and another one containing the metal precursors (Ni(NO3)2.6H2O, Pt(NH3)2(NO2)2). Triton X-100 (Merck) was employed as non-ionic surfactant, 1-propanol (Acros Organics) as co-surfactant and cyclohexane (SigmaAldrich) as the organic phase. The metal concentration in the aqueous phase was 1.5 M for the Ni catalyst, 0.2 M for the Pt catalyst and 1.7 M for the bimetallic PtNi catalyst. The volumetric proportions employed for each solution were Triton X-100/1-propanol/cyclohexane/aqueous phase  = 12/8/78/2.
The alumina support was added to the resultant reverse microemulsion and stirred for 3 h. Afterwards, Tetrahydrofuran-THF (Sigma) was incorporated (50 ml/g of support, at a rate of 0.8 ml/min) to destabilize the reverse microemulsion. The solution was stirred for 24 h, decanted, filtered and finally washed with ethanol and water. The obtained solid was dried overnight at 100 C and calcined in air at 700 C for 2 h (10 C/min).
Monometallic and bimetallic PtNi catalysts (denoted as 0.4Pt/Al2O3 IM, 4Ni/Al2O3 IM and 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 IM) were also prepared by simultaneous incipient wetness impregnation (IM) of the support, for comparative purposes. The metal loads, the precursors and the calcination procedure were the same employed for the catalysts prepared by the reverse microemulsion method. The synthesized catalyst and their identification are summarized in

2.2. Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction data have been recorded with an XPert MPD PRO diffractometer (PANalytical) using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.54059 Å) and a Ge(1 1 1) primary monochromator. The X-ray tube worked at 45 kV and 35 mA. The measurements were done from 10 to 70 (2θ). X-ray photoelectron spectra were recorded on a Physical Electronic 5701 equipped with a PHI 10-360 analyzer using the Mg Kα X-ray source. Binding Energy (BE) values were referred to the C 1s peak (284.8 eV) from the adventitious carbon for the catalysts before reaction and to the Al 2p peak for the catalysts after reaction. All deconvolutions of experimental curves were done with Gaussian and Lorenzian line fitting, minimizing the (χ2) chi-square values. N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms were registered for the support at 196 C using a Beckman Coulter SA3100 Surface Area Analyzer. Before the analysis, the sample was outgassed in vacuum (1 × 103 Pa) for 5 h at 180 C. The specific surface area was obtained by the BET equation and the pore volume by the BJH method. TEM images were taken with a Philips CM 200 of 200 kV; the samples were prepared using ethanol as dispersant. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of the fresh catalysts was performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Samples were reduced in a flow of H2 diluted in Ar (10%) at 50 ml/min and heated from room temperature to 1000 C (10 C/min). Raman spectra were recorded on a Bruker-Senterra Raman imagine microscope with the 532 nm NdYAg laser and a CCD detector. Each spectrum was collected at room temperature under 10 mW of laser power. The carbon content of the catalysts after reaction was obtained via Elemental Analysis technique using an Elemental Analyzer PerkinElmer 2400 CHN. Characterization of the catalysts before reaction was realized for the catalysts calcined.
2.3. Reactivity
Steady state experiments were carried out in a Microactivity-Reference reaction system from PID Eng&Tech (Spain) at atmospheric pressure in a temperature range between 400 and 700 C. A tubular fixed bed stainless steel reactor (i.d. 9 mm) with 100 mg of catalyst (250420 μm) was employed. The total gas flow rate was kept constant at 50 N cm3/min with stoichiometric composition diluted in He (CH4/CO2/He = 20/20/60). The space velocity and the contact time were 6000 h1 and 0.8 g h mol1, respectively; operating under plug flow conditions. Preliminary reactivity tests with different catalyst particle sizes and dilutions, measuring the radial and axial temperatures at different points, were performed to confirm the non-existence of heat or mass transfer limitations. Before reaction, catalysts were activated in situ with H2 (3% in He, 30 N cm3 min1) at 700 C for 2 h. The reaction temperature was measured with a thermocouple placed in the reactor bed. The reactor effluent was analyzed by GC (Agilent 4890D) equipped with TCD and FID detectors. Stability runs were performed at 700 C at the same reaction conditions as in the activity tests. C, H and O balances were closed with deviations lower than 5%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization
Results from N2 adsorptiondesorption revealed that the Al2O3(N) presented high surface area (ABET = 300 m2 g1) and pore volume (VP = 1 cm3 g1); the textural properties as well as the nanofibrous structure of the Al2O3(N) were stable up to 1000 C
[15]
,
[16]
. The XRD patterns of the catalysts before reaction are presented in
Fig. 1
. Two different phases for all of the catalysts which contain Ni can be principally observed; one corresponding to γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS 75-0921) and another one associated with the presence of NiAl2O4 (JCPDS 01-1299). Peaks related to metallic Ni or NiO were not detected, which could indicate that if these species were present, they would be quite small or in a low quantity to be detected by XRD. Signals associated with Pt were not registered in the XRD patterns of the bimetallic catalysts, except for the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME case; where the presence of weak and wide signals corresponding to metallic Pt (JCPDS 01-1190) was observed. This suggests that Pt particles, in the bimetallic catalysts, were well dispersed and rather small. Moreover, for the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 IM and the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 ME catalysts signals superimposed on the γ-Al2O3 were detected, associated with Pt0. These signals are more intense and wider for the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 IM catalyst than for the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 ME, indicating that the average particle size of Pt0 was lower for the catalyst prepared by ME.

The XRD patterns of the catalysts after reaction are presented in
Fig. 2
. First, it is interesting to observe that the XRD patterns of the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 IM and the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 ME catalysts did not show any modification with respect to the ones registered before reaction, where signals related to Pt0 and γ-Al2O3 were only detected. The average particle size of Pt0, for these catalysts before and after reaction, was calculated by the Scherrer equation as well as the Pt dispersion values, assuming spherical and uniform particles (
Table 2
). It was found that Pt was stabilized by the support and its particle size and dispersion did not change after reaction. Moreover, the Pt-catalyst prepared by ME presented lower average particle size and higher dispersion than the homologous Pt-catalyst prepared by IM. Peaks related to Pt were no detected for the bimetallic catalyst, thus the Pt0 particle size could not be calculated by the Scherrer equation. However, it was registered by HRTEM, Pt0 particle size values lower than 10 nm for both catalysts; as can be observed in

In addition, it is worth noticing that after reaction all of the Ni catalysts presented signals related to Ni0. The width of the Ni0 peak was modified with the Pt addition and the synthesis procedure, indicating that the Ni particle size is influenced by the Pt presence and the preparation method. The average Ni0 particle sizes, calculated by the Scherrer equation and estimated by TEM, as well as the Ni dispersion values, assuming spherical and uniform particles for the Ni containing catalysts after reaction, are presented in
Table 3
. It can be observed that the Ni0 particle size, in the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME, decreased when a small amount of Pt was introduced into the catalyst formulation; as was observed and reported for the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 IM catalyst
[16]
. The decrease of Ni particles size, by the addition of Pt, is attributed to a dilution effect that affects the Ni redispersion, decreasing the mobility of the Ni metal particles. On the other hand, if we compare the PtNi catalysts prepared in different ways, it is interesting to observe that in the Ni-containing catalysts prepared by ME the Ni0 particle dimensions are about 3336% lower than those observed in the catalysts prepared by IM, this trend was also observed for the Pt0 particle size in the Ni-free catalysts.

Furthermore, in the XRD profiles of the Ni-containing catalysts after reaction additional signals associated with graphitic carbon (JCPDS 89-8491) and NiO (JCPDS 65-6920) were observed. The intensity of these signals was reduced considerably for the Ni catalysts prepared by ME (4Ni/Al2O3 ME and 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME). Which suggests that the carbon formed over the catalysts synthesized by ME differs from that formed over the others Ni catalysts. For the Ni-free catalysts signals related to graphitic carbon were not registered.
TEM images of the catalysts before and after reaction are presented in

, respectively. It can be noticed that for the Ni containing catalysts, before reaction, only the nanofibrous morphology of the support was observed, Ni or Pt metallic particles could not be seen. However, in the TEM images of the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 IM and 0.4Pt/Al2O3 ME catalysts, apart from the support, metallic Pt particles of around 12 nm and 9 nm were also registered.

Moreover, for the catalysts after reaction, there is a considerable difference in carbon formation. For the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 IM, 0.4Pt/Al2O3 ME, 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME and 4Ni/Al2O3 ME catalysts, the ones with the lowest carbon content registered by the CHN analysis (
Table 4
), the formation of carbon structures was not observed. In contrast, the 4Ni/Al2O3 IM and 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 IM catalysts presented the formation of carbon, whose quantity seems to diminish in the catalysts prepared by ME.

The carbon contents (expressed as wt.%) in the catalysts after reaction are summarized in
Table 3
. It can be observed that in the Ni-free catalysts the net carbon formation was negligible. On the contrary, for the Ni-containing catalysts a considerable global carbon formation was registered. However, it was reduced when Pt was incorporated and drastically inhibited when the catalysts were prepared by ME. Preparing the catalysts by ME allowed reductions in the net carbon formation of 90 and 70% for the 4Ni/Al2O3 ME and the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME catalysts, respectively. It has been already reported that the carbon deposition is a process that depends on the metallic structure of the catalyst
[12]
,
[21]
, being inhibited when small metall particles are used
[22]
. These results were confirmed by the Raman and XPS spectra obtained for the catalysts after reaction (

Fig. 6. Raman spectra of the Ni-containing catalysts after reaction.
The Raman spectra of the monometallic Ni catalysts and the bimetallic PtNi catalysts are shown in
Fig. 6
A and B, respectively. All the spectra presented two intense and non-symmetrical signals, indicating the superposition of signals associated with different types of carbon. Deconvolutions of the Raman spectra indicated the presence of signals centered at 15881337 cm1 and at 15701348 cm1 associated with carbon nanofibers and carbon nanotubes
[16]
,
[23]

[24]
, respectively. The bands centered at 15881570 cm1 and at 13381337 cm1 correspond to the defect mode (signal D) and to the graffite mode (signal G)
[25]
, respectively. The Raman spectra of the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 IM and the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 ME catalysts did not show any signal related to carbon especies (data not shown). Additionally, comparing the Raman spectra of the Ni/Al2O3 and the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, it can be noticed that the relative intensity of the signals associated with carbon decrease when the catalysts are prepared by ME, specially those signals related to CNTs, in agreement with the results obtained by XRD and CHN analysis.
To determine the type of carbon formed, the C 1s core level spectra of the catalysts after reaction were devonvoluted and analyzed (see
Fig. 7
). It can be observed that, for all of the catalysts, a signal at 284.8 eV associated with adventitious carbon was registered. For the monometallic Pt catalysts only one additional weak signal related to coke at 282.4 eV was detected, confirming that coke accumulation over the Pt catalysts was minimal; as was observed by XRD, Raman and Elemental Analysis.

For the Ni catalyst prepared by impregnation (4Ni/Al2O3 IM) three signals related to carbon formation can be distinguished. The first one at 278.6 eV that could be assigned to CNTs formed over the catalyst surface, which represents the highest relative contribution
[16]
,
[23]
. The second and the third signals, located at 279.6 and 281.8 eV can be related to CNFs and filamentous carbon formed above the catalyst surface without physical contact, creating a differential charge effect, as was also reported by Pawelec et al.
[3]
.
Furthermore, for the Ni catalyst prepared by ME (4Ni/Al2O3 ME) only two signals associated with carbon deposition were observed. The signals are located at 279.5 and 282.0 eV, and are related to CNFs and filamentous carbon. The signal associated with carbon nanotubes was negligible, indicating that the formation of carbon nanotubes is inhibited when the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is prepared by ME.
For the bimetallic PtNi catalysts three additional signals related to carbon can be detected. The first one at 278.8 eV that could be assigned to CNTs formed over the catalysts surface, which represents the highest relative contribution in both catalysts. The second signal at 279.5 eV related to CNFs
[3]
,
[16]
and the third signal, the weakest one, at 282.0 eV, associated with filamentous carbon. It is worth noticing that all these signals are much less intense for the catalysts prepared by ME than for the Ni-containing catalysts prepared by IM, confirming that the addition of Pt and the ME method inhibit the net carbon formation. Additionally, signals related to CO (286.0 eV) and CO (288.0 eV) bonds were also detected for all of the catalysts after reaction, which were probably a product of the interaction between the CO2 and the catalysts surface; however, the relative contribution of these species was minimal.
The Biding Energies and the surface atomic ratios of the Ni 2p3/2 and Pt 4d5/2 core electrons for the catalysts before and after reaction are summarized in
Table 4
. It can be seen that, for all of the catalysts before reaction, two Ni species were detected; one registered at 855.2855.6 eV related to Ni2+ as NiO and another one at 856.1856.9 eV associated with Ni2+ as NiAl2O4
[26]
. Moreover, for the fresh Ni catalysts, prepared by ME, an additional signal at 852.9 eV was detected, which can be assigned to the presence of Ni0

[27]

[27]
(314.2314.9 eV) and PtO
[28]
(317.4317.8 eV) were registered; with the exception of the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 ME catalyst which only presented one Pt signal centered at 314.9 eV related to Pt0. It is interesting to point out that the Pt0/PtO ratio before reaction, increased when the catalysts were prepared by ME. Navarro et al.
[29]
have reported that the interaction between Pt and support or other metals produce changes in the relative superficial concentration of Pt0.
For the used Ni-based catalysts (4Ni/Al2O3 IM, 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 IM and 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME), three different signals were registered by XPS; at 852.9853.1 eV related to Ni0, at 854.4854.7 eV associated with Ni2+ as NiO and the last one at 856.1856.9 eV that can be assigned to Ni2+ as NiAl2O4. For the 4Ni/Al2O3 ME, after reaction, Ni as NiO was not observed, indicating that all the NiO presented in the fresh catalysts was reduced during the reduction process and the subsequent reaction. In this catalyst, only two signals at 852.6 eV and at 856.7 eV, associated with Ni0 and NiAl2O4 were detected. Additionally, it is interesting to point out that, in the Ni containing catalysts the Ni0/NiAl2O4 and the Ni0/NiO ratios increased when Pt was incorporated and when the catalysts were prepared by ME, as can be observed in
Table 5
. For the Pt-containing catalysts after reaction, only one signal at 314.2314.6 eV associated with Pt as Pt0 was registered.

Furthermore, the surface Pt/Al atomic ratios did not change after reaction. In contrary the Ni/Al ratios decreased after reaction. This diminution in the Ni/Al ratios was less pronounced for the PtNi catalyst and for the catalysts prepared by ME. This indicates that in Ni-based catalysts the Ni species over the catalysts surface after reaction can be stabilized by the incorporation of Pt and preparing the catalysts with an adequate procedure as the ME method.
In order to investigate the reducibility of the catalysts, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were realized. The TPR profiles of the fresh catalysts are shown in
Fig. 8
. For the Pt monometallic catalyst prepared by IM (0.4Pt/Al2O3 IM) two different peaks were principally observed; one at 126 C and another one at 321 C, which can be associated with Pt dispersed on alumina (PtO-Al2O3 complexes) and with residues of the dispersed PtO phase in isolated patches
[30]
, respectively. The second peak normally appears for low Pt concentration. In addition, for the Pt catalyst prepared by ME (0.4Pt/Al2O3 ME) no peaks were detected, in agreement with the XPS results; Pt0 was formed during the calcination procedure.

The TPR profile of the Ni monometallic catalyst prepared by IM (4Ni/Al2O3 IM) shows three broad peaks located at 469, 639 and 723 C. The width of the first peak (469 C) suggests that it can be related to the reduction of non-crystalline NiO species, in agreement with the XRD data. The temperature of reduction for these species is higher than for bulk NiO (327385 C
[31]
,
[32]
). This is due to the presence of aluminum ions of the support, which inhibit the propagation of nucleation; as has also been reported by Scheffer et al.
[31]
. The maximum peak located at 639 C is associated with the reduction of NiO located close to the surface and surrounded by a high number of aluminum ions
[31]
. The third peak, typical for Ni/Al2O3 catalysts calcined at high temperature, is related to the NiAl2O4 phase, which is formed through diffusion of Ni ions into the support

For the Ni catalyst prepared by ME (4Ni/Al2O3 ME) only one non-symmetric peak located at 729 C was registered. This peak is related to the reduction of the NiAl2O4 phase. However, the TPR profile presents a contribution at lower temperatures (around 640 C) than the maximum peak, which indicates the reduction of NiO species interacting with aluminum ions of the support. XPS results for this catalyst shown the presence of Ni0 species before reduction, which explains why the contribution of NiO species is lower for this catalyst than for the Ni catalyst prepared by IM. It is interesting to point out that the temperature associated with the reduction of the NiAl2O4 phase is slightly high for the catalyst prepared by ME, which can be due to the higher metalsupport interaction originated by the preparation procedure. Li et al.
[32]
found that the Ni/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by co-precipitation and by solgel methods present higher reduction peaks than the catalysts prepared by impregnation, due to the more intimate mixing between Ni and the support resulting from the preparation method.
The TPR profile of the bimetallic PtNi catalyst prepared by IM (0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 IM) presents a very broad peak with a maximum at 703 C and two shoulders at 430 and 501 C. This profile suggests the presence of Ni2+ as different reducible species. The first shoulder is associated with the reduction of non-crystalline NiO species. The second shoulder can be related with the reduction of NiO interacting with the support. The peak at 703 C is related to the presence of NiAl2O4. It is interesting to observe that all the peaks seem to be shifted to lower reduction temperatures, which indicates that the incorporation of Pt promotes the reducibility of Ni.
The PtNi catalyst prepared by ME (0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME) presents a TPR profile similar to the one observed for the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 IM catalyst, a broad signal with a maximum peak at 704 C and two shoulders at 299 and 388 C. The peak at 704 C corresponds to NiAl2O4, as for the catalyst prepared by IM this peak is shifted to a lower temperature due to the presence of Pt. The shoulder at 388 C can be related to the reduction of non-crystalline NiO species, shifted to lower temperature due to an intimate interaction of Pt. This Pt interaction is enhanced by the preparation procedure. The third shoulder (299 C) can be associated with the presence of PtO in isolated patches. It is worth noticing that the asymmetry of the signals suggests that the reduction of another kind of Ni species, as NiO surrounded by aluminum from the support, cannot be excluded.
Characterization results indicate that the incorporation of Pt in Ni-based catalyst has a great influence on the Ni species distribution, the Ni particle size and dispersion, in addition to the net carbon formation. In the bimetallic PtNi catalyst there is a synergic effect between PtNi which modifies the Ni disposition, as well as its reducibility by the spillover of hydrogen from Pt to Ni
[16]
. The addition of Pt breaks up the large metallic ensembles that favor carbon deposition. It is well known that the carbon adsorbed on small metal particles diffuses with greater difficulty than when adsorbed on large particles
[22]
. All these effects are magnified when the catalysts are prepared by the reverse microemulsion method. Preparing the catalysts by ME modifies the Ni and Pt ensembles, varying the dissociative adsorption capacity of CH4 over the catalysts surface, reducing the global carbon formation.
3.2. Reactivity
The conversion values of CH4 and CO2, registered at 600 and 700 C, are summarized in
Table 6
, as well as the equilibrium conversions calculated, considering simultaneous CO2CH4 reforming and reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) at the reactivity test conditions (atmospheric pressure and CH4/CO2/He = 20/20/60). Equilibrium calculations were done by the minimization of Gibbs energy taking into account CH4, CO2, H2, CO, H2O and He as species in the system, solid carbon was not considered. It can be observed that all of the catalysts were active for DRM and the CO2 conversions were higher than those of CH4. This latter fact indicates the presence of parallel reactions as the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) and the CO disproportionation (Boudouard reaction) reactions. Moreover, the conversion values were lower than those of equilibrium. Additionally, the catalysts prepared by ME presented at 600 C lower conversion values than those obtained with the catalysts prepared by IM. However, when the temperature was increased the conversion values obtained with all of the catalysts were quite similar. It is important to point out that for the bimetallic PtNi catalysts noticeable improvements in the CH4 conversions values were not registered. This can be due to the inhibition of methane cracking, which was evidenced by the lower carbon formation with these catalysts.

The selectivity values expressed as H2/CO ratios are shown in
Fig. 9
. It can be observed that all of the H2/CO ratios are lower than the equilibrium ones throughout the whole temperature range, being more notable at high temperature. The deviation of the H2/CO ratios from equilibrium at high temperature is related to the carbon formation by methane cracking and its gasification by the Boudouard inverse reaction, which are thermodynamically favored at high temperature, and are not included in the equilibrium data. Besides, the H2/CO ratios registered in the temperature range 500650 C for the catalysts prepared by ME were lower than those registered for the catalysts prepared by IM. However, at 700 C, while the H2/CO ratios obtained with the other catalysts tended to diminish, the H2/CO ratios of the catalysts prepared by ME considerably increased. This suggests that with the catalysts prepared by ME the side reactions responsible for decreasing the H2/CO ratio values are inhibited. In addition, the catalysts prepared by ME are more selective to H2 and CO than the impregnated catalysts, which present a higher net carbon formation.

The stability of the catalysts was tested under DRM conditions at 700 C for several hours. The CO2 conversion values for the first 14 h are presented in

AC. First of all, it should be noted that the stability of the catalysts was improved when the catalysts were prepared by ME. The CO2 conversion loss was enhanced from 1.3% h1 to 0.4% h1 in the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, from 0.4% h1 to 0.08% h1 in the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts and from 0.08% h1 to zero loss in the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. Additionally, the Pt addition also improved the stability of the Ni-based catalyst, in agreement with data reported in the literature
[16]
. These results indicate that the stability of the catalysts can be improved either by adding Pt or preparing the catalysts by the reverse microemulsion method.

In spite of the fact that the carbon deposition observed in the 4Ni/Al2O3 ME catalyst was lower than in the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 ME catalyst, its stability under DRM conditions was better. This suggests that the catalysts deactivation not only depends on the net carbon formation, but also depends on the Pt-Ni and metalsupport interactions, which influence the metal distribution, particle size homogeneity and nature of carbon deposition on the catalysts surface. Apparently, the carbon formed in the bimetallic catalysts seems to be less strongly bound to the Ni particles interacting with Pt. Carbon does not diffuse on Pt particles and almost all the carbon formed is gasified, ensuring a longer availability of active metal sites; improving the stability of the bimetallic catalysts.
Adding Pt and/or preparing the catalysts by ME the Ni0 and Pt0 particles size can be controlled and the metal encapsulation by carbon avoided. The activity and stability of the PtNi nanocatalysts is improved when the metal ensembles have similar dimensions to the fibers of the support, which avoids metal sintering and the insertion of Ni into the alumina structure. Monometallic and bimetallic PtNi catalysts prepared by ME and supported on the nanofibrous alumina seem to be successful catalysts for the DRM, with high selectivity towards H2/CO and low towards coke.
4. Conclusion
The PtNi nanocatalysts prepared by the reverse microemulsion method and supported on a nanostructured alumina are highly stable and active catalysts for DRM. The reverse microemulsion method has proved to be an efficient procedure to prepare catalysts, controlling the size and dispersion of the active species. Using the ME method and the nanofibrous support it is possible to obtain systems with homogeneous and well dispersed particles of Ni and/or Pt. The addition of Pt in Ni-based catalysts and the preparation of the catalysts by ME inhibit global carbon formation, promote the relative content of active species and avoid metal sintering, as well as improve considerably the stability of the catalysts.
