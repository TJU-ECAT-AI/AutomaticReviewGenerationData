Partial oxidation of methane over PtRu bimetallic catalyst for syngas production
Abstract
A bimetallic catalyst (PtRu 50/50) has been prepared for methane partial oxidation. Total metal load was 1 wt%. The support was alumina mixed with 25 wt% of a ceriazirconia mixture. This because of the good performances of alumina for such applications and to exploit the oxygen buffer effect of the ceriazirconia system. The catalyst has been prepared by incipient wetness and characterized by means of XRD, BET surface area, TPR/TPO and SEMEDS analyses. It showed good activity and high selectivity towards CO and H2, produced in a ratio suitable for FisherTropsch applications. The effect of spatial velocity (GHSV) has been investigated; ramping temperature up and down, some hysteresis has been evidenced, especially at the highest GHSV, mainly caused by thermal effects. Overall, 100% conversion of methane to H2 and CO at the appropriate syngas ratio (2/1) can achieved easily and with stability.

1. Introduction
During the last decades the environmental considerations have become one of the most effective driving force for new or revised processes.
According to various sources, natural gas (NG) reservoirs are larger and wider spread than thought before, mainly in the Middle East and Eurasia, but other areas of the world also have good shares. The estimated reserves rose from 5142 trillion cubic feet in 1997
[1]
, to approximately 6300 at the end of 2006
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
. Finding efficient and clean processes to exploit the NG reserves is a crucial step to solve both environmental end energetic issues. Transportation remains the major limitation to NG exploitation, requiring the development of in situ process units to upgrade the raw material to higher value and more easily transportable products. Higher hydrocarbons can be produced by the FisherTropsch process, based on syngas (H2CO, 2/1 mixture) that can be obtained from NG. One of the most common processes is natural gas steam reforming (SR), but the reaction is endothermic requiring some energy supply
[5]
. A suitable solution is coupling SR with non-catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of methane that is exothermic, obtaining a process called autothermal reforming (ATR)
[5]
. This process can overcome a limitation of the pure SR, which yields an H2/CO ratio in excess of the ideal value of 2, required by most FisherTropsch applications
[6]
. Nowadays ATR is usually the preferred technology employed in the conversion of natural gas to liquid products, both for economic and technical reasons
[7]
. Catalytic partial oxidation of methane is a valid alternative for syngas production being exothermic and yielding a H2/CO ratio equal to 2
[8]
and it is becoming a good solution for stationary processing units
[9]
. Many different catalysts have been tested for the CPO reaction, mainly metallic, but also hexaaluminates and perovskites have been investigated
[5]
,
[10]
,
[11]
,
[12]
. Nickel is commonly used since it is inexpensive, but it shows a tendency to sintering and needs to be stabilized with small amounts of different oxides
[5]
. Noble metals are widely used because even if they are much more expensive they are highly active and show better performances
[5]
. Ru is one of the least costly among the noble metals
[13]
and seems to be stable and very active and selective; other choices are Pt and Pd, but also Rh, Ir are valid catalysts as well
[14]
,
[15]
.
All these catalysts perform quite well for different reactions and conditions. There are instances, however, in which coupling different metals can improve performances, combining functionalities. Crisafulli et al.
[16]
demonstrated that increasing amounts of Ru added to a Ni catalyst, continuously improve both activity and stability of the monometallic catalyst for dry reforming (DR) of methane. Persson et al.
[17]
studied the PdPt system, proving that it has considerably more stable methane conversion in the combustion reaction than the monometallic palladium, independently of the support. Ryu et al. prepared Pd catalysts added with Ru or Rh that showed stable activity even after H2S poisoning
[18]
. Though very succinctly, a recent paper already mentioned the viability of a bimetallic PtRu catalyst, supported on alumina and ceria
[19]
. Most of the time, bimetallic catalysts show an activity improvement that is not only the additive effect of the two metals, but a synergic gain of function.
Our recent studies
[21]
,
[22]
evidenced ruthenium as a good catalyst for CPO, though its stability needs to be improved and wide hysteresis cycles are observed while varying reaction temperature, apparently connected to the ease with which Ru is reduced and oxidized. The main problem was the formation of RuO4, which is volatile and, if formed during the process, decreases the metal load on the catalyst. Further, RuO4 is very toxic and its formation gives rise to safety issues that must be solved eventually. As discussed in the present paper, there is no trace of RuO4 formation, confirming the viability of the catalyst prepared. Conversely, Pt hardly undergoes redox reactions and it has some activity for CPO as well
[23]
,
[25]
. In this work we present results of combining Pt and Ru on a bimetallic catalyst that showed good activity and selectivity towards CPO products and a much better stability than monometallic Ru.
2. Experimental
The catalyst was prepared mixing together three different powders. Two of these were prepared by incipient wetness (IW) using RuNO(NO3)3 as precursor, the third one was 1% Pt on alumina purchased from SigmaAldrich. For the first two powders we used different supports for Ru impregnation; (1) alumina, since it turned out to be the best among the supports previously compared
[21]
; (2) a mixture of ZrO2 containing 17.5% of CeO2. The latter support is very useful in partial oxidation because of its oxygen storage/release function
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]
. Both these supports were calcined 4 h at 950 C and their features before impregnation are reported in
Table 1
together with those of the final catalyst obtained mixing the 50 wt% of Pt/Al2O3, 25 wt% Ru/Al2O3 and 25 wt% Ru/CeO2ZrO2.
Table 1. Supports and catalysts features: surface area, total pore volume and average pore diameter after calcination in air
Support BET area (m2/g) Total pore volume (cm3/g) Average pore diameter (Å)
Al2O3 116 0.958 332
CeO2/ZrO2 32 0.135 171
Pt/Al2O3 118 0.371 126
Pt/Ru 50/50 100 0.425 170
Based on these supports we prepared two series of catalysts: Ru on Al2O3 and Ru on CeO2ZrO2, by impregnation with a solution of 0.31 g of RuNO(NO3)3 in deionized water. The amount of water was three times the support total pore volume. After water removal by evaporation at 110 C for 2 h, all the catalysts were calcined in air at 570 C for 3 h. Then the powders were calcined in reducing atmosphere (6% H2 in N2) at 700 C for 3 h. The final step was ball milling the mixture of the three powders (the third being Pt/Al2O3) in ethanol for 3 days. The powders were mixed together in order to obtain a total metal load of 1% resulting from 0.5% of Pt and 0.5% of Ru. Accordingly, we mixed 1.37 g of 1% Pt on Al2O3, 0.7 g of Ru on Al2O3 and 0.7 g of Ru on CeO2ZrO2. Consequently, the final catalyst has equal amounts of metals (Pt/Ru 50/50, w/w) but supports are in a different ratio (Al2O3/CeO2ZrO2 75/25, w/w). After ball milling, the powder obtained was washcoated onto cordierite monoliths until a 20% (w/w) increase was reached. The coated monoliths were then calcined in 6% H2 in N2 for 4 h at 700 C.
Each monolith has 400 cells per square inch (CPI), 10 mm length, square channels with 1.1 mm of internal size and wall thickness of 0.2 mm, after washcoating.
All catalysts were characterized by TPR and TPO to verify their reducibility and oxidability. A Micromeritics AutoChem 2910 instrument equipped with a TCD detector was used. Samples were pre-treated for 60 min at 200 C in Ar flow and then cooled to room temperature. Thereafter the flow was switched to 5% H2 in Ar and the temperature was increased at 15 C/min up to 900 C. Then the sample was cooled down to room temperature in Ar flow, the flow was switched to 5% O2 in Ar and again the temperature was raised to 900 C at the same heating rate.
XRD patterns were obtained with a Siemens D5000 diffractometer with a Cu Kα monochromatic radiation and a scanning range, 2θ, between 10 and 90.
We took some SEM pictures with a Philips XL30 connected to an X-ray fluorescence microanalyzer which allowed getting information about the composition of the sample. The instrument was equipped with two different detectors: a gaseous secondary electron (GSE) detector and a back scatter electron (BSE) detector. The latter allows evidencing the heavier species which produce a lighter image in the picture.
Activity tests of the washcoated catalyst were carried out in a continuous flow reactor, described elsewhere
[21]
. NDIR/O2 multichannel measurement was used for the analysis of CH4, CO, CO2, O2, NO and NO2 (NGA 2000 Rosemount Analytical MLT--Analyzer, MLT--Analysis Module).
The concentration of H2 in the outgoing gases was monitored using thermal conductivity detection, HYDROS 100 from Rosemount Analytical.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XRD patterns
Fig. 1
shows the XRD pattern for the prepared catalyst. The highest peaks (off scale) are those of the supports (δ-alumina, ZrO2, CeO2). Ru and Pt are present both in oxidized and in metallic forms. This was not expected for Ru: indeed, even if Ru is known to be easily oxidized, also from TPO
[21]
, considering that it was reduced right before the XRD analysis, RuO2 was not expected to be formed a short time after the reduction, its reduction being easy to achieve, as well. A sample of Ru on Al2O3 previously prepared and reduced did not contain any RuO2, as we reported previously
[21]
. It can be concluded that the Ru oxide particles formed during the preparation are quite strongly bonded to the support and therefore harder to reduce, probably because of a stabilizing effect of Pt. This is expected to result in a more stable catalyst.

3.2. TPR and TPO
The general reduction reaction is MeOx + xH2  Me + xH2O, where x identifies different oxides.
Fig. 2
reports the results of TPR and TPO of the catalyst powder. Reduction gives a peak with maximum at T = 111 C with a small shoulder at around 180 C, that might correspond to the reduction of PtO2 to metallic Pt. The position of the low T peak ha been reported in the literature to vary depending on the support and on the presence of other metals; de Leitenburg et al.
[26]
report a peak at 222 C for Pt supported on ceria, while Nyln
[27]
report a peak with maximum at 198 C for the same catalyst, but shifting down to 120 C for Ir addition. Peaks at lower temperatures are also reported; Navarro et al.
[28]
report reduction peaks at 100 and 239 C for Pt supported on alumina; Cheekatamarla and Lane
[29]
report reduction of PtO2 occurring between 100 and 125 C for Pt/CeO2 catalyst. Ru as well, supported on alumina, silica or ceriazirconia, yields reduction peaks with a maximum T of 110170 and 220 C as observed by Ji et al.
[33]
and by ourselves
[21]
,
[22]
. Therefore assigning our observed peak at 111 C can be problematic. It can also be associated to unknown Ru species. Indeed, even if XRD revealed ruthenium only as RuO2 or in the metallic form, there are other highly amorphous compounds formed by Ru according to the general reaction: RuO2(s) + yH+ + ye  RuO2y(OH)y(s) (0 < y < 2). Usually
[33]
, RuO2 reduction gives a peak at about 225 C, but we did not detect any remarkable peak at this temperature for our sample. The low peaks detected by XRD (
Fig. 1
) assigned to RuO2 and metallic ruthenium could be small not only because of their low amounts, but mainly because Ru in other forms is not detected by XRD analyses. This might also be an indication of the presence of small particles that give low peaks. The two superimposed peaks detected are probably a combination of the reduction of both the oxides and/or of other hydroxides formed by these metals. The broad and wide reduction peak between 500 and 600 C is due to ceria and zirconia, as clearly proved by a blank test on this support.

The TPO curve shows a first O2 sink at 153 C, again given by the amount of ceria and zirconia in the support. As for the TPR, a blank test on the support allowed to distinguish its contribution from that of the metals: the alumina and ceriazirconia mixture evidenced the same peak centered around 150 C detected during the analysis shown in
Fig. 2
. Then there is a large O2 sink between 500 and 850 C. This peak is assigned to the oxidation of ruthenium according to the reaction Ru + O2(g)  RuO2 occurring between 400 and 800 C
[33]
. Usually Ru can be further oxidized to its tetroxide according to the reaction RuO2(s) + O2(g)  RuO4(g) occurring between 800 and 1000 C
[33]
but we have no evidence of such a reaction in our TPO tests. This is positive because RuO4 is volatile and its formation leads to a loss of metal content in the catalyst, decreasing the life time of the catalyst itself. RuO4 is a strong oxidant, employed in different applications
[30]
,
[31]
,
[32]
, but avoiding its formation is very important because it is very toxic, thus harmful both for humans and the environment. On the other hand no significant effects or critical hazards are known for RuO2 and the LD50 for oral ingestion, dermal contact or inhalation is rather high.
According to literature, Pt does not undergo oxidation reactions: indeed both Persson et al.
[34]
and Diaz et al.
[35]
, reported no oxidation peaks for supported Pt catalyst. No evidences of Pt oxidation are shown by our analysis either.
3.3. SEM and EDS analyses
In order to check the surface of the catalysts after preparation and testing we took some SEM pictures and analyzed some areas by EDS.
Fig. 3
shows two images at 800× of a portion of a washcoated monolith channel before and after testing. Several white small spots are visible, presumably containing metallic clusters. According to EDS they are agglomerates of the support containing Ru and Pt. Al, O and Ce appear in the ratio given by the initial mixture we prepared. The Ru content is 0.48%, while Pt was not quantified because its peaks are superimposed on those of Zr. The darker surface has basically the same composition and no clear differences are detectable between the fresh and the tested sample. Apparently, testing the catalyst did not affect its structure.

3.4. Activity tests
We carried out activity tests always feeding a CH4/O2/N2 mixture 3.4/1.7/94.9% (v/v) (stoichiometric according to the CPO reaction) at different gas space velocities (GHSV) and temperatures (T). The reported GHSV (h1) was calculated as the ratio between the total volumetric flow rate (m3/h) at 20 C and the total monolith volume (m3).
Results are reported in terms of % variations between inlet and outlet concentrations scaled to the inlet methane concentration,
, where Ci is the concentration (vol%) of species i and
is that of methane at the reactor inlet.
allows easily analyzing the stoichiometry of the results. When applied to methane
is the standard % conversion. The amount of water has been calculated from H and O material balances, the balance on C being always very close to 100%. All plots report % variations as a function of the catalyst inlet temperature. The thermodynamic equilibrium composition reported in some of the plots below has been calculated with CHEMKIN's EQUIL code
[20]
. The program determines the minimum total free energy configuration by changing the relative amount of given species in a set to be specified. Provided that the C balance always closes quite satisfactorily with the C-bearing species measured (i.e. CH4, CO, CO2), the species included in the equilibrium set are simply CH4, CO, CO2, O2, H2, N2 and H2O. For consistency with the measured data, the equilibrium has been calculated assuming the reactor isobaric (Patm) and adiabatic, with an initial temperature corresponding to the measured inlet value, at a constant, atmospheric pressure.
Fig. 4
shows the catalyst activity at GHSV = 53,000 h1 during the heating step at 20 C/min. Methane conversion smoothly begins around 500 C, but below 535 C the conversion is very low. Then total and partial methane oxidation (TOM and CPO) suddenly increase and conversion grows fast up to 45%. Above 540 C the increase of conversion with T is slower, but steady. Methane conversion reached 89% at 780 C. At lower T, a significant amount of CO2 is produced, its conversion reaching 22% at 577 C. Above, the CO2 produced continuously decreases as the temperature rises. At the maximum temperatures investigated, the CO2 yield is quite low (<5% above 760 C) and its presence justifies the difference between CO and CH4 conversion. Water is twice the amount of CO2 up to about 540 C (then following TOM stoichiometry), but above that T its yield is comparable to that of CO2. Interestingly, at higher T both CO2 and H2O concentrations are rather low and the H2O/CO2 ratio again approaches 2, implying that the CO2 is formed almost exclusively by a background TOM. Selectivity towards CPO products is quite high and increases at higher T, where CO and H2 are the main products with only low amounts of water and CO2 detected. Their ratio decreases from 3 at lower T to stabilize at around 2 at higher T. Therefore, the reaction products fit the requirements for FisherTropsch applications. It can be observed that according to thermodynamics, CH4 and O2 should be converted into the products already at low temperature (<400 C) and CO2 and H2O are supposed to be formed, along with CO and H2. The experimental data approach the equilibrium only at high temperature, but they seem to be just shifted compared to the theoretical trends. Our previous studies evidenced that Pt supported on alumina, using a similar monolith, gives high methane conversions at low temperatures (400450 C), but with a quite high selectivity towards total methane oxidation (TOM) products even under rich conditions, while Ru activates the CPO reaction with very high selectivity at about 600 C
[21]
,
[22]
. The behavior of the bimetallic catalyst is similar to that of monometallic Pt at low T's, approaching monometallic Ru as the temperature rises. Interestingly, this feature implies that suitable proportions of Pt and Ru can determine the CO/H2 ratio at a given T. Is to be noticed that oxygen is the limiting reactant under these conditions: according to the
definition, when it reaches 50% for O2 it means that it reacted completely. The further increase of CH4 conversion is due to other reaction(s): the plot suggests steam reforming (CH4 + H2O  CO + 3H2) and dry reforming of methane (CH4 + CO2  2CO + 2H2), given that CO2 and water decrease as the temperature goes up, while CO and H2 increase their yield. In the early steps of the reaction (in space, when gases enter the monolith), methane is probably converted directly to CO2 consuming all the oxygen available according to the complete oxidation mechanism, with the reaction catalyzed mostly by Pt. Afterwards, water and carbon dioxide react forming CPO products.

3.4.1. Effect of gas space velocity
The effect of changing residence time has been investigated by varying the total feed flow rate, resulting in GHSV values approximately equal to 26,000, 53,000 and 93,000 h1. At higher GHSVs the reaction has a shorter time to occur, so a lower conversion is expected. Since we measure the composition of the gases exiting the monolith, increasing the space velocity has the effect of moving the reaction front forward. Therefore, the gas mixture analyzed at high GHSV should approximate the composition in the first millimeters of the monolith at lower space velocities, allowing to confirm the picture outlined from
Fig. 4
where a spatial sequence TOM  CPO has been suggested.
Fig. 5
shows methane conversion obtained varying the space velocities at an HR of 20 C/min, compared with the thermodynamic equilibrium.

Fig. 5. Activity of Pt50Ru50 as a function of catalyst inlet temperature and GHSV; HR = 20 C/min.
Obviously, the higher the GHSV, the lower the conversion measured. Further, conversion decrease at a given T is not linear with the GHSV increase, reflecting the non-linear conversion profiles along the monolith, as discussed previously
[21]
. It is also shown that the reaction onset is shifted towards higher temperatures as GHSV increases and it takes place more gradually, over a larger range of T, indicating that a larger GHSV can increase reactor stability. It is remarkable that at the lowest space velocity, methane conversion comes very close to the thermodynamic equilibrium prediction above 650 C. It would be probably possible to approach the equilibrium at even lower temperature if the GHSV is further decreased.
The analysis of the variations of the outlet other species is shown in
Fig. 6
. The picture refers to the same tests presented in
Fig. 4
and highlights the behavior of O2 and CO2. It shows that the first methane conversion/O2 consumption at lower temperature leads to CO2 according to total oxidation stoichiometry. Above approximately 550 C oxygen is completely consumed, producing the maximum CO2 (approximately
 = 25%) allowed by the initial feed (O2/CH4 = 0.5) and the total oxidation stoichiometry.

Fig. 6. CO2 and O2 scaled variations during the same test presented in
Fig. 5
and other tests at different GSHVs; HR = 20 C/min.
The following decrease of CO2 is then caused by all the reactions (dry and steam reforming, direct and reverse watergas shift) that lead to CO and H2 using the methane left after TOM with insufficient O2. The result replicates for any GSHV, with a gradual shift to higher temperatures when GSVH increases, as already observed in
Fig. 5
. At the highest GHSV (93,000 h1) total oxidation appears to take place to higher temperatures and CO2 production remains quite high (above 15%) even at the highest T. Recalling that increasing GHSV decreases the residence time, i.e. the outlet gas approaches its composition in the first part of the monolith when the space velocity was lower, results of
Fig. 6
confirm that the catalyst first converts CH4 according to complete oxidation mechanism (TOM) and then CPO products are formed.
Fig. 7
clearly shows that TOM occurs as the reaction ignites and becomes more important as GHSV increases. Indeed, at 26,000 h1 the water amount never reaches the stoichiometric value (if compared to CO2 production) meaning that H2O is also involved in other reactions. At 93,000 h1, on the other hand, the H2O/CO2 ratio is quite stable around the value of 1.82 that is to be expected if TOM occurs. At 53,000 h1 the trend is intermediate. There are different reactions in which water could be involved: steam reforming, gas shift (direct or reverse) are likely occurring simultaneously, so it is hard to identify them.

3.4.2. Temperature cycles
All tests previously presented and discussed, have been run both increasing and decreasing the temperature. This allows adding further details to the catalyst chemical and thermal behavior. As reported
[21]
,
[22]
,
[36]
catalysts can undergo oxidation or reduction depending on the atmosphere they are exposed to and their aptitude for redox reactions. Pt can hardly be oxidized, as confirmed by TPO characterization (both from our analysis and literature, see Section
3.2
); once reduced after preparation it keeps that form. On the other hand Ru is quite easy both to reduce and oxidize, resulting in different activity in the CPO reaction. Actually, the atmosphere in the reactor changes from oxidizing to reducing, both along its length and at a given axial position, when the T is varied. As temperature rises CO and H2 prevail in the reactor, resulting in a reducing atmosphere. At lower T more oxidizing conditions prevail. Cycling T, catalyst reducing and oxidizing cycles can be detected
[21]
.
Fig. 8
shows methane conversion both during heating (same data as in
Fig. 5
) and cooling. Hysteresis is observed, particularly in the ignition region. Above and below this region, the catalyst behavior during heating and cooling is almost reversible, independently of the GHSV, but the extension of the hysteresis region is proportional to the GHSV. The enlargement of the hysteresis region with GHSV combines with the shifting and smoothing of the ignition T connected to higher GHSV.

Fig. 8. CH4 conversion as a function of T and GHSV during heating and cooling cycles; HR = 20 C/min.
The overlapping of the rightmost branches of the curve, particularly at the higher GHSV discourages an explanation purely based on redox behavior, as suggested previously
[21]
. It marginally holds at the lowest GHSV, that indeed leads to higher conversion, thus higher concentration of reducing gas (CO and H2) in the reactor, is likely to cause some reduction of the catalyst and consequently its activity.
The most evident hysteresis in the ignition/extinction region is more likely connected to the thermal behavior of the catalyst together with aberrations that arise when reporting the reactor performances in terms of T measurements outside the monolith, just before it. Assuming that the thermocouples rapidly adjust to the programmed changes of temperature in the oven, it is likely that the temperature inside the reactor has a different transient, provided that exothermic surface reactions are taking place, as already observed
[37]
. Accordingly, during cooling, the temperature inside the monolith remains higher than at its inlet, also because of the thermal inertia of the ceramic support, keeping the reactions active and the conversion still high. In addition, at higher space velocities, TOM, the most exothermic of all the reactions, has a larger role, so the effect is more pronounced.
Summarizing, we can conclude that Pt improves the stability of the catalyst preventing or limiting the Ru redox behavior. Conversely, a lower GHSV is required to achieve higher CO/H2 yields.
3.4.3. Catalyst aging
Repeated tests under the same experimental conditions (GHSV, HR, composition) allow evaluating the aging effect on the catalyst. The results are reported in
Fig. 9
: lines are overlapped up to 560 C, then the line of the latter test (after the catalyst worked for 30 h) stays a little below the other line, but the difference is very small and the maximum conversion reached is still close to 100% (being 97.5 and 95%, respectively). As expected, the addition of Pt had a stabilizing effect on the catalyst, not only on its redox behavior, but also preventing a marked aging showed by monometallic Ru as reported in a previous study
[21]
. No special aging treatments have been applied to the catalyst, the results presented come from the comparison of activity tests run under the same conditions on different days. The aging time (30 h) is quite limited, but already these results already indicate a better stability as compared to a monometallic Ru catalyst. At the same conditions, the monometallic Ru catalyst previously tested evidenced a marked decrease of activity (see
[21]
, Fig. 14). In that case, the maximum conversion after 30 h decreased by 10% and the light-off temperature rose by 50 C. This is not observed for the bimetallic catalyst prepared and used in this work, which keeps the same light-off temperature and shows only a slight decrease of the maximum conversion.

4. Conclusions
We developed a more efficient and stable catalyst for syngas production from methane. We combined the best features of Pt that activates methane at low temperature and those of Ru that is very selective towards CPO products. We also reduced the hysteresis shown by monometallic ruthenium catalysts
[21]
,
[22]
.
The catalyst prepared has shown the desired behavior: Pt stabilizes Ru, limiting redox reactions during the heating and cooling cycles. The small residual hysteresis is likely caused by thermal effects and not by chemistry (reduction/oxidation reactions). The light-off temperature is also lower than for monometallic ruthenium, but the catalyst starts converting reactants following mainly total oxidation stoichiometry. As shown by thermodynamic calculation, CO2 and H2O production is predicted: consequently the final product composition is determined by a combination of reactions occurring after part of the methane has been converted into CO2 according to the complete combustion mechanism. As temperature increases, CPO products clearly prevail and their ratio stabilizes at a value suitable for FisherTropsch applications (H2/CO2 = 2). Even if not tested for many tens of hours, the catalyst did not show any marked aging effects, keeping its activity almost unchanged.
The overall effect of platinum is to trigger the reaction at lower temperature and even if the first reaction to occur is TOM, partial oxidation also ignites at a lower temperature if compared with monometallic ruthenium catalyst
[21]
,
[22]
(about 550 C vs. 630 C). The only drawback shown by the catalyst is a little lower activity, since lower GHSV is required to have the same conversions as reached with monometallic ruthenium.
Another clear aspect evidenced by the bimetallic catalyst is that TOM activates before CPO, in space (within the monolith) which also means in time. After CO2 and H2O have been formed other reactions occur to produce the final CPO products: steam reforming and dry reforming are the most likely candidates, but reverse water gas shift might take place as well. The identification, quantification and control of these reactions are part of an ongoing work.

<questions>


How do bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, and what potential insights could future UHV studies provide in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
