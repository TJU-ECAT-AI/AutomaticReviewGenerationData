Catalytic combustion of methane over bimetallic PdPt catalysts: The influence of support materials
Abstract
The effect of support material on the catalytic performance for methane combustion has been studied for bimetallic palladiumplatinum catalysts and compared with a monometallic palladium catalyst on alumina. The catalytic activities of the various catalysts were measured in a tubular reactor, in which both the activity and stability of methane conversion were monitored. In addition, all catalysts were analysed by temperature-programmed oxidation and in situ XRD operating at high temperatures in order to study the oxidation/reduction properties.
The activity of the monometallic palladium catalyst decreases under steady-state conditions, even at a temperature as low as 470 C. In situ XRD results showed that no decomposition of bulk PdO into metallic palladium occurred at temperatures below 800 C. Hence, the reason for the drop in activity is probably not connected to the bulk PdO decomposition.
All PdPt catalysts, independently of the support, have considerably more stable methane conversion than the monometallic palladium catalyst. However, dissimilarities in activity and ability to reoxidise PdO were observed for the various support materials. PdPt supported on Al2O3 was the most active catalyst in the low-temperature region, PdPt supported on ceria-stabilised ZrO2 was the most active between 620 and 800 C, whereas PdPt supported on LaMnAl11O19 was superior for temperatures above 800 C. The ability to reoxidise metallic Pd into PdO was observed to vary between the supports. The alumina sample showed a very slow reoxidation, whereas ceria-stabilised ZrO2 was clearly faster.
1. Introduction
Catalytic combustion has been shown to be a promising alternative to flame combustion for heat and power production in gas turbines
[1]
,
[2]
. When the fuel is combusted over a catalyst the operating temperature is reduced to a level where almost no thermal NOx is formed. Additionally, ultra-low levels of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons are achieved. Another advantage with catalytic combustion is less vibration in the combustion chamber. The catalytic combustion technique has recently reached the stage of commercialisation. However, the technique still has some hurdles that should be overcome. One of the main issues is to develop a catalyst that can ignite the fuel at the compressor outlet temperature, between 350 and 550 C, depending on the type of gas turbine. Several engineering solutions have been proposed to solve the problem of how to ignite the catalyst. One of the most frequently studied concepts is to include additional components such as preburners and electrical heaters in order to reach a temperature at which the catalyst is ignited. This adds to the complexity of the gas turbine and in the case of preburners it is also a source of nitrogen oxide emissions
[3]
. Hence, a very active catalyst is desirable in order to reduce the need for preburners.
Palladium-supported catalysts have received considerable attention as ignition catalysts due to their high activity for methane combustion under lean conditions
[2]
,
[4]
,
[5]
. Recent studies have however shown that the stability of Pd catalysts is not sufficient for maintaining an adequate methane conversion, since the initially so high conversion decreases with time
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
. Hence, igniting the fuel at the compressor discharge temperature will be increasingly difficult. To overcome this problem a second metal may be added to the palladium, forming a bimetallic catalyst. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that PdPt supported on alumina is a promising bimetallic catalyst for methane combustion
[9]
, showing a far more stable methane conversion compared with the monometallic counterpart.
Another feature of palladium-based catalysts is the decrease in methane conversion when PdO decomposes into its less active metallic form at temperatures above 750 C. The reoxidation of PdO takes place under cooling at a lower temperature than the decomposition, which creates a hysteresis
[4]
,
[11]
. This phenomenon induces instabilities in the catalytic combustor.
Many researchers have shown that the behaviour of Pd-based catalysts is strongly affected by the support material. Especially the behaviour during oxidation and reduction of Pd is influenced, as well as the thermal stability. ZrO2 has, for example, been shown to enhance the reoxidation of PdO compared to Al2O3 for supported palladium catalysts
[12]
. In order to improve the reoxidation of PdO further and/or to prevent deactivation of the support material, different additives have been used. Several studies have shown positive effects of adding ceria to catalysts for methane combustion, especially during the reoxidation of PdO
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
,
[16]
,
[17]
. When ZrO2 is doped with yttrium oxide the support material becomes more thermally stable and acquires a tetragonal structure
[18]
,
[19]
. Another quite thermally stable material is manganese substituted La-hexaaluminate (LaMnAl11O19)

have reported that this material has a surface area of 28 m2/g after calcination for 4 h at 1200 C.
Most studies of bimetallic catalysts for methane combustion have been made using alumina as support material. Therefore, it is of interest to study how different support materials influence bimetallic catalysts. This study focuses on PdPt bimetallic catalysts and the influence of support materials. Five different support materials were chosen for the investigation, i.e. Al2O3, ZrO2, ceria-stabilised ZrO2, yttria-stabilised ZrO2 and LaMnAl11O19. Their effect on the catalyst performance has been addressed. Special attention was given to the performance of the catalysts at steady-state conditions, i.e. trying to retain a stable conversion of methane over time, as well as the influence on the PdOPd transformation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Catalysts consisting of palladium and platinum supported on five different support materials, i.e. γ-Al2O3 (PURALOX HP-14/150, Sasol Germany GmbH), ZrO2 (Mel Chemicals), yttria-stabilised ZrO2 (Mel Chemicals), ceria-stabilised ZrO2 (Mel Chemicals) and LaMnAl11O19, were prepared. In addition, a monometallic palladium catalyst supported on alumina was prepared as a reference catalyst. The details regarding these catalysts are summarised in
Table 1
. All catalysts contain equal molar amounts of noble metals (470 μmol metal/g), calculated from 5 wt.% Pd/Al2O3. The bimetallic catalysts had a molar ratio of 2:1 Pd:Pt.

,
[23]
. First, ammonium carbonate was dissolved in large excess in deionised water. Stoichiometric amounts of metal nitrates, corresponding to the metal ions in the material, i.e. lanthanum nitrate, manganese nitrate, aluminium nitrate, were also dissolved in deionised water. The nitrate solution was dripped into the ammonium carbonate solution under vigorous stirring at room temperature. The pH of the mixture was kept at 9 by continuously adding aqueous ammonia solution. The resulting precipitate was centrifuged and washed twice with acetone and dried at 100 C over night. The powder was then calcined for 4 h at 1200 C.
The different support materials were thereafter impregnated with the noble metal/metals. An aqueous solution of the metal ion/ions was prepared by dissolving Pd(NO3)2, and Pt(NO3)2 for the bimetallic catalysts, in deionised water. The noble metal solution was dripped onto the support materials and carefully mixed, as the incipient wetness technique requires. This procedure was repeated twice with a drying step at 300 C in between. The resulting powder was calcined at 1000 C for 1 h.
The catalyst powders were mixed with ethanol in the ratio of catalyst powder/ethanol is 0.2 and the slurries were ball-milled for 24 h. Cordierite monoliths (400 cpsi, Corning) with diameter 14 mm and length 10 mm, were then immersed into the slurry and dried at 100 C. This procedure was repeated until the required weight percent of catalyst material was fixed on the monolith, i.e. 20 wt.%. The coated monolith was then calcined at 1000 C for 2 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterisation
After calcination at 1000 C in air the specific surface areas of the catalysts were measured on the powder by means of nitrogen adsorption at the temperature of the liquid nitrogen on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument. The surface area was determined according to the BrunauerEmmetTeller (BET) method. The samples were degassed in vacuum for at least 2 h at 250 C prior to analyses.
The CO-chemisorption measurements were performed on the catalyst powder by using a volumetric technique. Prior to the measurements, the samples were dried in vacuum at 120 C, reduced in a flow of H2 (50 ml/min) at 300 C for 1 h, evacuated at 300 C for 1 h and then cooled to 35 C. The CO-chemisorption analyses were thereafter carried out using a dual isotherm method.
Inductive coupled plasma (ICP-AES) was performed on all catalyst powders in order to verify the amount of noble metal.
The redox properties of the catalysts were analysed by using a Micromeritics AutoChem 2910, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments were carried out on 0.2 g of the catalyst powder, which has been calcined in air. A gas mixture of 2 vol.% O2/He flowing at 20 ml/min was continuously passing over the sample. The temperature was increased by 10 C/min from 300 up to 900 C, followed by a decrease to the initial temperature, 300 C. This temperature cycle was repeated twice in order to obtain stable curves. The second curve is used in the figures presented in this paper.
The crystal structure of the various catalysts were analysed by X-ray diffraction, by using a Philips Xpert diffractometer operating in a flat sample mode. The operating parameters were the following: Cu Kα radiation, 40 mA, 40 kV, 2θ scanning from 20 to 80 with a step size of 0.02 with a duration of 60 s per step.
In situ XRD measurements on the catalyst powders have been carried out using the same instrument, but then equipped with an Anton Paar XRK900 high-temperature chamber. The chamber was aligned by comparing the spectrum of Pd/Al2O3 at room temperature obtained in the flat sample mode with the one obtained with the chamber, taking as a reference peak the position of PdO at 2θ = 33.889. The experiments were performed in 2 vol.% O2/N2 flowing at 60 ml/min. The samples were heated/cooled at a rate of 10 C/min. The samples were heated up to 880 C and cooled to room temperature in order to stabilise the sample prior to the recording of the diffractograms.
2.3. Catalytic activity measurements
The catalytic activity for methane combustion was tested in a conventional tubular flow reactor. The monoliths were fitted in a tubular quartz reactor, which in turn was located inside a temperature programmable furnace. The reactor was operated at atmospheric pressure and the feed consisted of 1.5 vol.% CH4 in air with a space velocity of 250,000 h1, based on the total volume of the monolith including void volume. The temperature was recorded in the gas phase by a thermocouple placed upstream the monolith. The composition of the product gas was monitored by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC Varian 3800) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.
For each catalyst two different types of activity tests were performed; a transient and a steady-state test. In the transient test the temperature was changed continuously by 10 C/min. Two consecutive heating and cooling cycles at temperatures between 300 and 925 C were conducted. The first heating/cooling cycle was carried out in order to ensure a constant activity of the catalysts and the second heating/cooling cycle is used in this study. With this technique it is possible to study the light-off properties of the catalysts and the PdO decomposition and reoxidation.
In the steady-state tests the temperature was increased stepwise. The operation parameters were held constant during 1 h for each temperature step. The experiments started at 470 C and the temperature was raised stepwise by 50 C at a time up to 720 C. The same catalysts were used as in the transient tests. The level and stability of methane conversion were studied with this technique.
3. Results
3.1. BET surface area
The results from the BET measurements are presented in
Table 1
. A large disparity in surface area between the samples is observed. The monometallic palladium catalyst, supported on alumina, has the highest BET surface area at 102 m2/g, followed by the bimetallic catalyst supported on the same material at 91 m2/g. The other catalysts had much smaller surface areas compared to the alumina samples. The hexaaluminate-based catalyst has a surface area of 18 m2/g. The three ZrO2-based samples have different surface areas, with PdPtZrO2 having the largest surface area of the three at 15 m2/g, while both PdPtCeZrO2 and PdPtYZrO2 had surface areas of 10 m2/g.
3.2. CO chemisorption
The results from the CO-chemisorption measurements are presented in
Table 1
. Dissimilarities in CO uptake were observed for the various catalysts and the value appears to be independent of the BET surface area. PdPtZrO2 has the highest vale at 14.9 μmol/g catalyst, and PdPtAl2O3 has the lowest value at 5.2 μmol/g catalyst. All other catalysts have values between 7.3 and 9.0 μmol/g catalyst. The CO uptake is reflecting the dispersion of the noble metals. Since the absorption geometry of CO is not known for the PdPt bimetals it is difficult to calculate an exact value.
3.3. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)
TPO plots of the various catalysts are displayed in
Fig. 1
. During the heating ramp the monometallic palladium catalyst, PdAl2O3, shows three positive peaks located close to each other at between 660 and 880 C. These peaks have been assigned to oxygen release as PdO decomposes into metallic Pd
[24]
,
[25]
. Pd is oxidised back to PdO during the cooling ramp, shown as a negative peak due to the O2 consumption. The onset temperature of the reoxidation is 560 C, which is 100 C lower than the onset temperature of the PdO decomposition. A catalyst consisting of Pt supported on alumina has also been analysed by TPO (not shown in figure) to investigate whether Pt gives any peaks in the tested temperature range, but no peaks were observed.

The bimetallic catalysts exhibit a redox behaviour, which is different from that of the monometallic palladium catalyst. When Pt is added to the Pd catalyst only one peak is observed during heating and the onset temperature of reduction is shifted to lower temperatures than for the monometallic Pd catalyst. The support material has a major impact on the redox properties of the catalyst. The reduction of the alumina-supported catalyst, PdPtAl2O3, occurs between 560 and 665 C, while for PdPtLaMnAl11O19 the reduction peak starts at 590 and ends at 725 C. This peak is much larger than the corresponding peaks for the other bimetallic catalysts and the oxygen signal does not quite reach the baseline until 900 C. All zirconium samples have an onset temperature of the reduction of 630 C, some 70 C higher than for PdPtAl2O3. The reduction of PdPtZrO2 proceeds until 765 C, PdPtCe-ZrO2 proceeds until 755 C and PdPtYZrO2 until 745 C.
All catalysts are to some extent reoxidised during heating at temperatures below the reduction peak, shown as a broad negative peak. The degree of reoxidation varies between the catalysts and takes place over a wide temperature range. This effect is most pronounced for the alumina samples, shown for temperatures between 335 and 500 C. The reoxidation of PdPtAl2O3 is even larger during heating than during cooling, indicating a slow reoxidation process. The monometallic PdAl2O3 is also reoxidised during heating, but at higher temperatures between 410 and 550 C. Both PdPtLaMnAl11O19 and PdPtYZrO2 show some reoxidation during heating, but less distinct than for the alumina samples. In the case of PdPtZrO2 and PdPtCeZrO2 only a very small effect can be observed.
The TPO profiles of the bimetallic catalysts also diverge considerably during cooling. The temperature where the catalysts start to reoxidise is for all catalysts lower than the onset temperature of the reduction during heating, which creates a hysteresis. The size of the hysteresis differs between the catalysts and appears to be influenced by the nature of the support material. Additionally, the temperature range over which the reoxidation take place differs between the samples.
PdPtAl2O3 has the widest hysteresis of all PdPt catalysts, with a difference between reduction and reoxidation temperatures of the oxide of 80 C, which is still some 20 C less than for the monometallic palladium catalyst. The peak representing oxidation is not easily distinguished because it is very wide and reaches all the way to 330 C. The hysteresis of the PdPtLaMnAl11O19 is somewhat narrower than for the alumina-supported catalyst, i.e. 60 C. The zirconium-based catalysts reoxidise at higher temperatures than the other two bimetallic catalysts. The temperature gap between the three zirconia-based catalysts also varies. PdPtCeZrO2 and PdPtZrO2 have the narrowest hysteresis of all tested catalysts, 30 and 40 C, respectively. However, PdPtCeZrO2 reoxidises much faster since the oxidation peak reaches the baseline at higher temperature than for PdPtZrO2. PdPtYZrO2 has more difficulties in reoxidising and a hysteresis of 70 C is obtained. This means that the support material has a great influence on the reoxidation of Pd.
3.4. Crystalline structure
In order to identify the crystal phases of the noble metals and the support materials, X-ray powder diffraction was performed at room temperature. The XRD diffractograms of all catalysts are shown in
Fig. 2
. The XRD pattern of PdAl2O3 reveals that palladium appears mostly as PdO, shown by the characteristic peak at 2θ = 33.889. Only a small peak at the position of metallic palladium at 2θ = 40.115 is detected. The opposite is true for the bimetallic catalysts. Only very weak reflections of PdO are displayed, however, in some cases they may be masked by an overlap of the support material. The bimetallic catalysts show strong reflections located between the 2θ values of Pd0 and Pt0, i.e. between of 40.115 and 39.889. This indicates a close interaction between the two metals. No reflection attributed to PtO is noticeable in any of the samples.

The nature of the support materials was investigated as well. The support of both PdAl2O3 and PdPtAl2O3 is present mostly as θ-Al2O3, but small amounts of α-Al2O3 are also detected. The hexaaluminate sample has a support consisting of LaMnAl11O19. For the zirconium-based samples, distinct differences are observed. In PdPtZrO2 the zirconium is present in a monoclinic form, while for PdPtYZrO2 the addition of stabiliser leads to a tetragonal form, i.e. Zr0.88Y0.12O1.94. In the case of addition of ceria, a ceriazirconium tetragonal solid solution, Zr0.84Ce0.16O2, is recognised.
3.5. In situ high-temperature XRD
In situ XRD measurements operating at high temperatures were performed in order to study how the presence of Pt and the different support materials influence the PdPdO transformation. In
Fig. 3
the diffractograms taken at different temperatures during heating are shown for monometallic PdAl2O3. For the fresh sample a large peak at the position of PdO was observed, but no Pd0 peak. The presence of the high-temperature chamber somehow lowers the intensity of the signal, which explains why the Pd0 for the fresh sample is not shown in this case but only for the flat sample mode. The sample was then heated up to 880 C and cooled down to 300 C and the next diffractogram was subsequently collected. A very small Pd0 peak was observed and the PdO peak was slightly smaller than previously. When the sample was heated up to 600 C the Pd0 peak disappears. However, at 800 C the Pd0 peak reappears and the PdO peak decreases. At 880 C the Pd peak is even larger while the PdO peak has diminished dramatically. When temperature is increased the peaks are shifted to lower 2θ values. As seen in
Fig. 3
, the shift is not the same over the diffractogram but increases with higher 2θ values. The PdO peak appears in almost the same position for the different temperatures, but the Pd0 peak is clearly shifted to lower 2θ values with increasing temperature. This is most likely due to dilatation of the chamber itself that occurs with increasing temperature at high 2θ values.

Fig. 3. High-temperature in situ XRD profiles of Pd-Al2O3 during heating.
In
Fig. 4
, the diffractograms of PdPtAl2O3 are presented. For the fresh sample a large peak in the PdPt position is observed, but also a PdO peak. The subsequent diffractograms at 300 and 400 C did not detect any PdO. However, at 500 C the PdO peak starts to rise and at 600 C the peak is slightly larger. At 700 C the PdO peak again disappears and is neither found at 800 C. At the same time as the PdO peak changes, the area of the PdPt peak changes. When PdO becomes larger, the PdPt peak becomes smaller and vice versa. At 700 and 800 C the PdPt peak reaches its maximum size. Similar behaviour is shown for the other bimetallic catalysts. The support materials showed no noticeable changes of their crystal phases at the various temperatures. Due to the shift in 2θ with temperature, the composition of the indicated solid solution between Pd and Pt could not be determined.

The stability of PdO was studied by measuring the area of the PdPt peak, located in-between Pd0 2θ = 40.115 and Pt0 2θ = 39.889. The PdO peak at 2θ = 33.889 could not be used due to overlap of some of the support materials. The area of the peak at a specific temperature is referenced to the area at the maximum temperature tested, i.e. at 800 C for the bimetallic catalysts and 880 C for PdAl2O3. The relative intensity of the peak as a function of temperature is plotted in

In
Fig. 5
,
Fig. 6
, the results from the heating part of the cycle are shown. All catalysts, even PdAl2O3, show a decrease of the peak intensity during heating up to 600 C. This may be attributed to the formation of PdO during operation. To which extent the catalysts are affected during heating varies between the catalysts. PdPtLaMnAl11O19 undergoes the largest absolute drop in intensity, but PdPtAl2O3 and PdAl2O3 also show significant reoxidation. The zirconium-based samples are less affected during heating. PdPtCeZrO2 shows only small changes, whereas the decreases of PdPtYZrO2 and PdPtZrO2 are slightly more pronounced. At 700 C all bimetallic samples showed an increase of their relative PdPt intensity suggesting that PdO had started to be reduced.
In
Fig. 5
,
Fig. 6
, the results from the cooling cycle are shown. All samples appear to have started to reoxidise at 500 C. However, PdPtAl2O3 reoxidises very slowly, shown by the high peak intensity even at 300 C. All other samples have a drop in relative area, demonstrating that some PdO has been formed. PdPtCeZrO2 reoxidises until 400 C, whereafter no change in the peak area is shown. The catalyst also shows the lowest relative intensity of all bimetallic catalysts at 300 C, but PdPtZrO2 and PdPtLaMnAl11O19 are almost as reoxidised.
The reoxidation of PdPtAl2O3 and PdPtCeZrO2 has been studied further, but this time in air (21% O2 and 79% N2) instead of the 2 vol.% O2/He mix. The temperature was kept at 500 C and a continuous flow of air was posed over the samples. Every hour a diffractogram was collected. In
Fig. 7
, some representative diffractograms of PdPtAl2O3 are shown. The sample initially had a relatively large PdPt peak and only a small PdO peak. With time the peak of PdO increases and the peak of PdPt decreases. After 10 h the sample appears to have stabilised since the areas of the peaks do not change anymore. In
Fig. 8
, the diffractograms of PdPtCeZrO2 are shown. This time the stabilisation of the peak areas only takes 1 h, demonstrating that the reoxidation is much faster compared to PdPtAl2O3.

3.6. Catalyst activity
3.6.1. Transient activity tests
The performance of the catalysts during complete oxidation of methane under lean conditions is presented in
Fig. 9
,
Fig. 10
. During heating, the methane conversion of the monometallic palladium catalyst, PdAl2O3, increases continuously with temperature up to 770 C, where it reaches a local maximum at 71%. Thereafter, the methane conversion decreases to 68% at 845 C. By further increasing the temperature, the catalyst regains its activity and attains 75% at 925 C. This behaviour is characteristic for palladium catalysts during methane combustion under lean conditions. It is generally agreed that PdO is the active phase under this conditions, but at 770 C the PdO decomposes into the less active metallic Pd resulting in the drop in methane conversion.

Similar combustion behaviour is observed for the alumina-supported bimetallic catalyst, PdPtAl2O3, although it is not as active as the monometallic catalyst. The temperature where the conversion drops during the heating ramp is shifted to a lower temperature, 750 C. By changing support material the drop in activity at this temperature range may be suppressed. The three zirconium-containing catalysts show a much smaller drop in methane conversion. PdPtLaMnAl11O19 does not show any drop in methane conversion in this temperature range and it appears to be more active at higher temperatures.
No significant differences in the level of methane conversion were obtained for the various bimetallic catalysts. The activity curves of the PdPt catalysts, except PdPtAl2O3, follow each other up to 680 C. PdPtAl2O3 exhibits the highest activity of the bimetallic catalysts at lower temperatures, but for temperatures above 720 C the conversion of bimetallic catalysts on other supports surpass that of the alumina catalyst. The three zirconium-based catalysts present similar activities at the lower temperatures. However, at the higher temperatures the conversion differs between the catalysts. The methane conversion of PdPtZrO2 and PdPtCeZrO2 followed each other closely up to 720 C, whereafter PdPtZrO2 becomes slightly more active. PdPtYZrO2 gives the lowest activity of the zirconium-based catalysts, especially at the higher temperatures. Above 800 C PdPtLaMnAl11O19 is superior among the bimetallic catalysts.
In
Fig. 10
the results from the transient activity tests during cooling are shown. For PdAl2O3 the conversion drops down to a local minimum at 750 C, followed by an increase up to a local maximum at 580 C. The recovery of activity during cooling corresponds to the reoxidation of Pd. Similar combustion profiles are shown for the PdPt catalysts. Recovery of activity occurs at a lower temperature for the alumina catalyst, at 705 C, than for the zirconium-based samples. PdPtCeZrO2 shows the highest value for the onset temperature at 735 C, followed by PdPtZrO2 and PdPtYZrO2 at 730 and 725 C, respectively. Even PdPtLaMnAl11O19 shows a minimum during the cooling ramp at a temperature of 660 C. The conversion of PdPtCeZrO2 and PdPtYZrO2 decreases more when temperature is decreased than that of PdPtZrO2 prior to the reoxidation. However, after the reoxidation, PdPtCeZrO2 is superior in activity.
An uncoated monolith has also been evaluated in order to investigate the rule of homogeneous combustion in the temperature range of the transient activity tests. During heating the uncoated monolith first showed activity above 920 C (not shown in figure). During cooling the activity first drops at 900 and at 815 C no methane conversion is observed at all. The methane conversion never reaches more than 68%, indicating that the activity at the higher temperatures is not only a contribution of homogeneous combustion but a large contribution comes from catalytic combustion. For temperatures below 920 C during heating and below 815 C during cooling, the contribution to methane conversion is mostly catalytic.
3.6.2. Steady-state activity tests
In order to study the conversion of methane under steady-state conditions, activity tests in which the temperature was increased stepwise were performed on all catalysts, the results are presented in
Fig. 11
a and b. There are major differences between the monometallic and the bimetallic catalysts as well as between the various support materials. The monometallic palladium catalyst is initially the most active for each temperature step; however, the methane conversion drops rapidly with time-on-steam at all temperatures. This is well in line with earlier results from our laboratory

[10]
. At 470 C PdAl2O3 initially obtained a conversion of 11%, but it dropped down to 8% after only 1 h. The drop becomes larger with increasing temperature.

Considerably more stable conversions are obtained for the bimetallic catalysts for temperatures up to 620 C. In contrast to the monometallic Pd catalyst, all PdPt catalysts show a slight increase in methane conversion with time. PdPtAl2O3 gives a stable conversion up to 620 C, whereafter the conversion starts to drop with time (cf.
Fig. 11
a). The activity of PdPtLaMnAl11O19 increased significantly with time up to 570 C, but the opposite was observed for the higher temperatures. For temperatures above 670 C the conversion drops rapidly in the beginning of each temperature step, but levels out with time.
The activity tests for the three zirconium-based catalysts are presented in
Fig. 11
b. The methane conversions over PdPtZrO2 and PdPtYZrO2 followed each other closely up to 570 C. PdPtZrO2 showed a stable conversion of methane even at 670 C, i.e. at a 50 C higher temperature than for the rest of the catalysts. PdPtCeZrO2 was superior at all temperatures, especially at high temperatures. Its activity even surpassed the activity of PdPtAl2O3 at 620 C.
4. Discussion
4.1. The influence of Pt additions
In the transient activity tests, the monometallic palladium catalyst supported on alumina gives higher activity for methane combustion than the PdPt catalysts. The PdPt catalysts tested in this study consist of equal molar amounts of noble metals as on the PdAl2O3 catalysts, but divided as 2/3 of palladium and 1/3 of platinum. The XRD studies of the PdPt catalysts indicate that some of the palladium is alloyed with Pt. Hence, the bimetallic catalysts contain smaller amounts of the active PdO phase compared to PdAl2O3. It is well known that palladium catalysts are more active than platinum with respect to methane combustion under lean conditions
[26]
. Therefore, it is not surprising that the bimetallic catalysts have slightly lower activity. However, alloys may obtain other catalytic properties than those of the individual metals. Previous study has shown that a bimetallic PdPt catalyst neither behaves as a Pd catalyst nor as a Pt catalyst during methane combustion
[9]
.
The lower ratio of palladium oxide in the bimetallic samples is not necessarily only a disadvantage. Small amounts of metallic palladium have been reported to enhance methane combustion due to metallic Pd being effective in cleaving the CH bonds in the methane molecule
[27]
,
[28]
. Since metallic Pd is difficult to maintain in an atmosphere with high oxygen partial pressure, as in gas turbines, an alloy with Pt may be a way to stabilise the metallic phase below the temperature for PdO decomposition.
Despite the fact that PdAl2O3 achieved high combustion activity when the temperature was changed continuously as in the transient test, a significant time-on-stream deactivation is observed when temperature is kept constant. This result is in agreement with those of others
[6]
,
[7]
. The phenomenon has also been observed under more realistic gas turbine conditions, with higher pressures and flow velocities
[8]
,
[10]
. In the present study, the decline in methane conversion is observed for temperatures as low as 470 C. The transient activity test shows that the decomposition of PdO starts first at 770 C. Hence, the drop in activity when temperature is kept constant is probably not due to PdO decomposition. This conclusion is in line with the in situ XRD studies of PdAl2O3, which shows no PdO decomposition at temperatures below 800 C. The steady-state tests showed a major decrease in activity with time-on-stream for the palladium catalyst. Hence, for any practical application it will be of paramount importance to improve the stability of methane conversion.
As shown in the steady-state tests, incorporation of platinum into the palladium catalyst prevents the drop of methane conversion. This is in line with previous results from our laboratory
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
and from others
[6]
,
[7]
. Yamamoto and Uchida
[7]
even reported that their PdPt/alumina catalyst remained at 50% methane conversion for a tested time range of 25.00 h. In this study, the PdPt catalysts retain a stable methane conversion for all temperatures, apart for temperatures above 670 C. The in situ XRD studies reveal that PdO has started to decompose at 700 C. Therefore, the drop in activity shown for the bimetallic catalysts at the higher temperatures is probably attributable to PdO decomposition.
For temperatures below 670 C, the activities of the bimetallic catalysts slightly increase with time-on-stream. As seen by in situ XRD, more PdO is formed during operation. This may be the explanation of the increase in methane conversion since PdO is more active than its metallic state. The oxidation during operation is also shown by the TPO analyses, where signal gives a wide shallow valley during heating prior to reduction. However, the formation of PdO is stabilised after a certain time for all bimetals, even for PdPtAl2O3.
Narui et al.
[6]
explained the higher stability of PdPt catalysts as effect of less pronounced particle growth of bimetals during operation. Even so, a bimetallic catalyst is a complex system and the stability obtained may be an effect of several factors. Another explanation may be that PdPt catalysts are less sensitive to water. It has been reported that monometallic Pd catalysts are strongly inhibited by water, possibly due to the formation of Pd (II) hydroxide
[29]
,
[30]
. Since water is one of the reaction products it is difficult to avoid this type of deactivation. Nomura et al.
[31]
have shown that the inhibition effect of water for the palladium catalysts could be diminished by adding platinum to the palladium catalyst. They suggested that the higher resistance is due to a synergistic effect between Pt and Pd.
The activities obtained in the transient tests are generally lower than the steady-state results. Since the measured temperature in these two tests is the gas temperature at the inlet of the catalysts, it is not certain that the surface temperature is the same. The surface temperature may increase with the conversion. Furthermore, the activation during operation may also result in different activities. Ciuparu and Pfefferle
[12]
have previously reported about an activation process during operation in a transient test. Their activity values recorded for the cooling ramp in between 600 and 400 C was higher than those observed for the heating ramp in the same temperature range. When the same catalyst was heated again, the higher activity was preserved. In the present study, all catalysts were first used in the transient test and then in the steady-state test. Therefore, it is possible that similar activation has occurred as observed by Ciuparu et al. For the transient tests during heating all catalysts showed similar activities especially at lower temperatures. More clear differences may be observed between the catalysts in the steady-state tests. Since the operating conditions in a gas turbine are more similar to the steady-state tests, this test may give a more realistic comparison. However, both types of activity tests provide valuable information about the catalysts. For that reason it is preferable to carry out both tests, not only with respect to stability but also on the level of activity.
Even though the TPO profiles of the monometallic and the bimetallic differ, the peak observed during heating of the bimetallic catalysts is most likely related to PdO decomposition, as in the case of PdAl2O3. This assumption is based on the good correlation between TPO and in situ XRD results. The in situ XRD analyses show that PdO is decomposing in the same temperature range as the reduction peak in TPO appears. Similar results are observed during cooling, where the oxidation peak represents PdO reoxidation. This result is supported by the fact that the platinum supported on alumina does not give any TPO peaks in the tested temperature interval.
In the transient tests PdO decomposes at much higher temperature than in the in situ XRD and TPO analyses. This is most likely related to the different atmosphere used in the characterisation techniques and the activity test. It has earlier been reported that the temperature at which PdO decomposition occurs is strongly influenced by the oxygen partial pressure and that the temperature increases with pressure
[25]
,
[32]
,
[33]
. For the activity test the oxygen partial pressure was almost 10 times higher than in the other analyses, which may explain the higher temperature of the PdO decomposition. However, the atmosphere used in the activity test is more similar to the one used under gas turbine conditions.
4.2. The influence of support material
The redox properties of PdO and the catalytic activity for methane conversion are strongly dependent on the nature of the support material. PdPtAl2O3 has the highest activity of the bimetallic catalysts at the lower temperatures, both for the transient and the steady-state activity tests. This is most likely related to its surface area being almost 10 times larger than that of the other support materials. At higher temperatures the benefit of the larger surface area decreases and other catalysts surpass the alumina-supported catalyst. Another explanation may be that a part of the Pd reacts with some of the supports, resulting in less PdO in the catalysts. For example reaction between Pd and Ce earlier been reported by Bera et al.
[34]
.
PdPtCeZrO2 is the most active of the bimetallic catalysts in the steady-state test at temperatures above 620 C. However, in the transient tests PdPtCeZrO2 has similar activity as PdPtZrO2 during heating, but differs during cooling. Hence, the activity of PdPtCeZrO2 becomes clearly improved in the steady-state tests compared to the transient tests. Trovarelli et al.
[35]
have reviewed the properties of ceria-based catalysts. They explained that ceria has the ability to shift easily between reduced (Ce3+) and oxidised (Ce4+) states, which enhance the oxygen mobility in the material. This would enable oxygen to be transported to the noble metal particles and improves the reoxidation process. This results in a smaller temperature gap between the decomposition and reoxidation of PdO, which is in line with the findings presented in this study. Both the TPO profile and the in situ XRD diffractograms suggest that PdPtCeZrO2 reoxidises Pd very easily during cooling. Groppi et al.
[14]
reported that the addition of ceria to palladium catalysts does not significant affect the light-off performance, but it clearly affects the catalytic behaviour at higher temperatures due to stabilisation of the active PdO species in this temperature range. This appears to be true not only for monometallic palladium catalysts, but also for the PdPtCeZrO2 tested in this study in the steady-state experiment. Not only Pd is affected by the presence of Ce. Bozo et al.
[36]
have reported about beneficial properties on the catalytic activity for Pt-based catalysts when Ce is included in the support. However, as most of the Pt seems to be alloyed with Pd, the oxidation of Pt is probably of less importance.
For higher temperatures, above 800 C, the PdPtLaMnAl11O19 catalyst is superior, shown by the transient activity tests as the steady-state tests were only performed to 720 C. This catalyst differs in many respects from the other PdPt catalysts. When temperature is increased, the support material itself becomes active towards methane oxidation. Sekizawa et al.
[37]
showed that the high catalytic activity of the Mn-substituted hexaaluminates results in a suppressed drop of activity in the temperature range of PdO decomposition temperature. Hence, a support with high activity is superior for temperatures above the PdO decomposition temperature. However, at lower temperatures PdPtLaMnAl11O19 shows poor activity, especially in the steady-state test.
For the zirconium-based samples, the drop in activity due to PdO decomposition is not as pronounced as for the alumina-based catalysts. Narui et al.
[38]
observed similar behaviour for monometallic Pd catalysts. They explain the suppressed effect of PdO decomposition as resulting from the presence of stable PdO species in the PdO/ZrO2 interface. The suppressed effect of PdO decomposition may also be an effect of the higher oxygen mobility in ZrO2 materials compared to alumina support.
5. Conclusions
The objectives of this paper were to investigate the influence of support materials for palladiumplatinum catalysts as well as to compare monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. The conclusions are summarised below:
•
Transient activity tests showed higher activity towards methane combustion for the monometallic palladium catalyst than for the bimetallic PdPt catalysts.
•
At steady-state conditions, i.e. when temperature was kept constant, the methane conversion drops significant with time for the monometallic palladium catalyst.
•
The decrease in methane conversion seems not to be attributable to PdO decomposition into its metallic state, since the in situ high-temperature XRD showed no decomposition at temperatures below 800 C.
•
All bimetallic catalysts gave significantly more stable methane conversion compared to the monometallic catalyst during operation at steady state.
•
The nature of the support material affects the combustion performance of the bimetallic PdPt catalysts. PdPtAl2O3 was the most active at the lower temperatures, PdPtCeZrO2 was the most active between 620 and 800 C, whereas PdPtLaMnAl11O19 was the most active for temperatures above 800 C.
•
PdPtCeZrO2 reoxidises PdO much easier than PdPtAl2O3, for which it takes up to 10 h before the reoxidation is completed.
•
The activity of the bimetallic catalysts increases with time-on-stream, probably due to PdO formation during operation.
•
The drop in the methane conversion during the PdO decomposition was suppressed for the ZrO2-based catalysts compared to the Al2O3-based catalysts.
•
Both activity tests operating in transient and in steady-state modes are important for comparing the stability and level of activity of various catalysts.
