MnOx/Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for CO oxidation in H2-rich streams
Abstract
The catalytic activity of Pt on alumina catalysts, with and without MnOx incorporated to the catalyst formulation, for CO oxidation in H2-free as well as in H2-rich stream (PROX) has been studied in the temperature range of 25250 C. The effect of catalyst preparation (by successive impregnation or by co-impregnation of Mn and Pt) and Mn content in the catalyst performance has been studied. A low Mn content (2 wt.%) has been found not to improve the catalyst activity compared to the base catalyst. However, catalysts prepared by successive impregnation with 8 and 15 wt.% Mn have shown a lower operation temperature for maximum CO conversion than the base catalyst with an enhanced catalyst activity at low temperatures with respect to Pt/Al2O3. A maximum CO conversion of 89.8%, with selectivity of 44.9% and CO yield of 40.3% could be reached over a catalyst with 15 wt.% Mn operating at 139 C and λ = 2. The effect of the presence of 5 vol.% CO2 and 5 vol.% H2O in the feedstream on catalysts performance has also been studied and discussed. The presence of CO2 in the feedstream enhances the catalytic performance of all the studied catalysts at high temperature, whereas the presence of steam inhibits catalysts with higher MnOx content.
1. Introduction
The recent interest in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology has increased the number of publications on selective CO oxidation in H2-rich environments. High purity hydrogen for the proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) could be produced by means of fuel reforming, which should be followed by WGS reaction in order to remove CO
[1]
,
[2]
. As the platinum-based electrodes from PEMFC stack irreversibly deactivate with a CO content above 10 ppm, an additional stage for further CO removal is necessary
[3]
. Different methods can be chosen for further CO removal: (a) methanation, which consumes H2 with the subsequent loss of fuel efficiency
[4]
; (b) selective H2-diffusion through membranes, which requires high temperature and pressure gradients
[5]
; (c) pressure swing adsorption (PSA)
[6]
and (d) selective CO oxidation, also known as preferential CO oxidation reaction (PROX)
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
.
The PROX reaction is a simple and efficient method for removing low levels of CO from H2-rich gas streams. The method consists of adding oxygen to the fuel processor effluent in order to preferentially oxidize CO rather than H2. The main reactions occurring in such a system are:
(1)
(2)
Due to the gas composition from low temperature watergas shift (WGS) outlet4575 vol.% H2, 525 vol.% CO2, 0.52 vol.% CO, 525 vol.% H2O, N2 (balance)water-gas shift (WGS) and methanation reactions (of both CO and CO2) could also take place:
(3)
(4)
(5)
While the WGS reaction is beneficial in its forward direction, methanation reactions are always detrimental and should be avoided.
An effective PROX catalyst should show: (a) high activity for CO oxidation, if a stream containing 1 vol.% CO in 60 vol.% H2 must be cleaned down to a maximum CO content of 10 ppm, a CO conversion beyond 99.9% must be reached; (b) high selectivity for oxidizing CO rather than hydrogen, (c) wide operation window, in order to avoid precise temperature control; (d) effective operation at high GHSV values; (e) resistance to deactivation by carbon dioxide and water present in the feedstream.
Theoretically, the amount of oxygen necessary for complete CO oxidation is half the molar amount of CO in the feedstream, according to Eq.
(1)
. However, an excess of oxygen is needed due to the simultaneous oxidation of H2. This excess of oxygen is characterized by the process parameter λ, defined as twice the ratio of moles of oxygen to moles of CO in the feedstream (λ = 1 is sufficient for the complete oxidation of CO in the absence of an oxygen-consuming side reaction (H2 oxidation)).
Selectivity is defined as the ratio between oxygen involved in the CO oxidation and the total amount of oxygen reacted (for oxidizing CO and H2). As the selectivity is inversely proportional to oxygen excess, an ideal catalyst should be active even at low λ values, in order to maintain the selectivity at acceptable values.
A traditional catalyst for the PROX reaction consists of a noble metal (Pt, Pd, Ru) supported on alumina
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
,
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
. Oxidation of CO on these catalysts is a multi-step process obeying a single-site competitive LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism, where CO, H2 and O2 compete for the noble metal surface. These catalysts are characterized by operating at temperatures about 170200 Cthe low temperature WGS reactor outlet temperatureand needing a high λ value (about 2.2) for complete depletion of CO, with the corresponding lack of selectivity (typically 34%)
[13]
. However, they are resistant to deactivation by water
[10]
, although they are slightly inhibited by CO2
[15]
.
The key for the improvement of the CO oxidation rate is to allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2. New catalyst formulations are being developed towards supplying these catalysts with an additional site for oxygen adsorption, which will enhance the reaction rate, by addition of a promoter
[16]
,
[17]
. An example of this development is the addition of Fe as a promoter for Pt catalysts
[18]
,
[19]
,
[20]
,
[21]
. The Pt serves as the site for CO adsorption, whereas the Fe oxide promoter dissociates the O2 molecule, resulting in a non-competitive, dual-site mechanism. Other promoters reported for Pt-based catalysts are Ce2O3
[22]
and cobalt oxide
[7]
,
[23]
. Other active catalysts reported in the literature are base-oxide supported Au
[24]
, mixed CuOCeria
[25]
, zeolite-based
[26]
and bimetallic catalysts of PtSn
[27]
,
[28]
, and ceriazirconia-supported Pt
[29]
.
Some authors reported the influence of the promotion by metal oxides with redox properties. In this way, Yan et al.
[30]
found that the addition of cobalt oxide to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst significantly improve the activity of the catalyst (90% at 90 C and 99.9% at 120 C, compared with 10 and 45% at the same temperature). Sirijaruphan et al.
[31]
have found that Fe promotes Pt/Al2O3, and reported that the initial CO oxidation reaction rate is 5.7 times higher than the H2 oxidation rate (stabilized at four times higher at steady state). In the same manner, Liu et al.
[17]
promotes the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst with Fe oxide, creating a non-competitive dual site for oxygen adsorption, thus enhancing the activity (with λ = 1, it increases from 13.2% to 68%, having a maximum at 90 C).
MnOx is reported as high oxygen storage capacity compound
[32]
,
[33]
,
[34]
. MnOx has been studied in oxidation reactions
[35]
,
[36]
and as support for Au catalyst in the PROX reaction
[37]
,
[38]
. MnOx-doped Pt catalysts have been studied for automotive pollution control and for CO oxidation (in H2-free streams)
[39]
,
[40]
. However, a MnOx-doped Pt catalyst has not been reported as catalyst for the PROX reaction.
In this work, an alumina-supported Pt catalyst has been modified by adding MnOx to the catalyst formulation. The obtained catalysts have been tested for CO oxidation both in H2-free and H2-rich environments. The effect of CO2 and H2O on catalysts CO oxidation behavior has been studied, and activity and selectivity towards CO oxidation, as well as CO yield, have been calculated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation and characterization
A Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by impregnation. MnOx-containing catalysts were prepared by successive impregnation or co-impregnation, varying the MnOx content from 2 to 15 wt.% Mn. The supportγ-Al2O3, SPH 505A supplied by Axens, BET surface area of 129.1 m2 g1, average pore diameter of 11.5 nmwas previously calcined in air at 350 C for 4 h. Pt was deposited by impregnation from an aqueous solution of the chloride-free platinum salt tetra-amminplatinum(II) nitrate, while Mn was deposited by impregnation from an aqueous solution of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O. After each impregnation, all the samples were dried overnight at 110 C, and then calcined in air at 400 C for 5 h. Catalysts with a particle size in the range 0.160.25 mm were used in the experiments.
Seven catalysts were prepared: the base catalyst Pt/Al2O3 (P1A); MnOx/Al2O3 with 2 wt.% Mn (M2A); a set of three catalysts with 2 wt.% Mn and 1 wt.% Pt with different sequence of impregnationMnOx/Pt/Al2O3 (M2P1ASI): firstly, Pt was deposited on alumina and, after that, Mn was deposited on the resultant precursor; Pt/MnOx/Al2O3 (P1M2ASI): firstly, Mn was deposited on alumina and, after that, Pt was deposited on the resultant precursor; Pt/MnOx/Al2O3 (P1M2ACI): Pt and Mn were deposited by co-impregnation on Al2O3Pt/8 wt.% MnOx/Al2O3 (P1M8ASI): firstly, Mn was deposited on alumina and, after that, Pt was deposited on the resultant precursor; Pt/15 wt.%MnOx/Al2O3 (P1M15ASI): firstly, Mn was deposited on alumina, and after that, Pt was deposited on the resultant precursor.
The structure of both support and catalyst was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction in a Philips Xpert-MPD apparatus, using CuKα radiation, with typical operation parameters being: a scanning 2θ range of 2070 with 2 min1 scanning rate and 0.02 data interval.
TPR and TPD experiments were conducted in a Micromeritics Autochem 2910 apparatus. For TPR experiments, the sample was pretreated by heating to 150 C (1 h) in a flow of nitrogen, in order to remove surface water, followed by heating up to 400 C, in order to clean the sample surface, an then cooled down to 30 C. TPR was carried out from 30 C until 400 C with a heating rate of 10 C min1 in a flow of 50 cm3 min1 of 5 vol.% H2 in Ar. For TPD experiments, the sample was saturated with pulses of 5 vol.% O2 in He at 35 C, and then heated in He stream up to 500 C at 10 C min1. The exhaust gases were detected by a TCD and recorded.
2.2. Reaction system, analysis method and calculations
The experiments were carried out in a plug flow reactor consisting of a tube of stainless steel (0.8 cm i.d., 11 cm length) inserted in a convective oven. The catalyst, diluted in pyrex glass in order to dissipate the heat generated during reaction, occupied a total bed volume of 1 cm3, corresponding to 4 cm length. The reactants flew downwards, and the reactor temperature was measured at the inlet and in the middle of the catalyst bed by K-type thermocouples.
Prior to an experiment, the catalyst was activated in situ according to the following procedure: it was first heated from room temperature up to 300 C in a flow of 50 cm3 min1 of He, then, the flow was changed to an equimolar flow of H2 and He of 100 cm3 min1 and the temperature kept for 2 h at 300 C, and, finally, the sample was cooled down to 30 C in 50 cm3 min1 of He. Catalytic tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure, with a temperature ramp of 3 C min1 from 30 to 300 C. As the temperature rise is slow compared to the residence time (0.20.6 s), the reactor is supposed to be isothermal at each time.
Helium (99.999%, Air Liquide) was used as an inert gas during the experiments. The reactant gases were H2 (99.999% purity, Air Liquide), CO2 (99.99%, Praxair), O2 (99.999%, Air Liquide) and a calibrated mixture of 10.5 vol.% Ar in CO (Praxair). When required, ultrapure water (Millipore) was added by means of a mass flow controller followed by evaporation to the gas mixture. When water was fed, all pipes were heated to 50 C in order to avoid water condensation.
All experiments were carried out with a total flow rate of 200 cm3 min1, with the following compositions: 1 vol.% CO, 060 vol.% H2, 01.5 vol.% O2, 05 vol.% CO2, 05 vol.% H2O and He (to balance). A deactivation test in the PROX reaction was carried out by operating at constant temperature (140 C) for 5 h, and feeding 200 cm3 min1 of a mixture consisting of 1 vol.% CO, 1 vol.% O2, 60 vol.% H2 and He (to balance).
Analysis of the reactor feedstream and the reaction products was carried out by GC (Hewlett-Packard 6890) coupled to a MS (Hewlett-Packard 5973). An untreated silica capillary column of 10 m, which was unable to separate the gases, was used in order to provide for the required pressure loss in the GC. The MS detector was used for quantification of different components, using He as the carrier, and monitoring the most abundant signals (m/z) for: CH4 (16), H2O (18), CO (28), O2 (32), Ar (40) and CO2 (44). The signal corresponding to Ar was used as internal standard. In such a way, the gas can be analyzed every 60 s.
CO conversion was calculated based on the CO consumption within the reactor, as follows:
(6)
where FCOin and FCOout are the CO molar flows entering and exiting the reactor, respectively. Similarly, O2 conversion was calculated based on the O2 consumption:
(7)
where
and
are the O2 molar flows entering and exiting the reactor, respectively. Thus, the selectivity (S) of oxygen conversion towards CO rather than H2 was calculated, in streams with H2, as

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The actual Pt and Mn contents of the catalysts, evaluated by AAS, are shown in
Table 1
. The XRD patterns for the Al2O3 support (after calcination at 350 C in air), MnOx (obtained by calcination of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O at 350 C in air) as well as the prepared catalysts are shown in
Fig. 1
. The XRD patterns for the alumina support and the base catalyst P1A are essentially identical, because of the low Pt content (<0.4 wt.%) and the high dispersion of the noble metal. Comparing the catalysts with an Mn content of ca. 2 wt.%, we can realize that essentially the same diffractogram is obtained for the three catalysts (P1M2ASI, M2P1ASI and P1M2ACI), and only an incipient peak at 2θ equal to 56.8 is detectable for the P1M2ASI sample. On the other hand, the catalysts with a higher Mn content show more intense peaks corresponding to Mn, the intensity for such peaks increasing with the Mn content. A Pt signal was not detected for our catalysts. The diffraction signals of MnOx in
Fig. 1
identified at 2θ equal to 28.86, 37.57, 42.98, 56.86 and 59.44 have been attributed to MnO2 (JCPDS 89-5171), whereas a weak signal at 65.04 has been attributed to Mn2O3 (JCPDS 89-4836). Considering the low calcination temperature used to prepare MnOx (350 C), mostly MnO2 is expected to predominate together with a small amount of Mn2O3, consistent with the XRD results.

M2A presents a single reduction peak around 420 C, with a hydrogen consumption of 0.036 mmol g1 corresponding to a molar H2/Mn-ratio of 0.10. This means very little reduction of the alumina-supported MnOx in the absence of Pt up to 500 C. Ferrandon et al.
[43]
for alumina-supported MnOx on cordierite prepared by precipitationdeposition and calcined at 800 C, and Doebber et al.
[44]
for MnOx/ZrO2 prepared by impregnation and calcined at 600 C, obtained higher reduction degrees and TPR peaks at lower temperatures. These differences, however, can be attributed to the different preparation procedure, support nature and/or higher calcination temperatures, which would favor the presence of different MnOx species (mostly Mn2O3 compared to mostly MnO2 in our catalyst) and much higher dispersions than in our samples.
The catalyst P1M2ASI shows a single peak, centered at 230 C; the presence of Pt seems to promote reduction of manganese oxide at lower temperature. Hydrogen consumption in TPR for this sample has been quantified to be 0.060 mmol g1 which, assuming that the average oxidation state for Pt remains similar to that in P1A, corresponds to a molar H2/Mn-ratio of 0.11, just slightly higher than that in M2A. Catalysts with a higher Mn content, i.e., P1M8ASI and P1M15ASI, show a main peak centered at ca. 100 C, followed by a shoulder at ca. 130 C. In both catalysts, a synergetic effect between MnOx and Pt can be observed, as the reduction of both Pt and MnOx occurs at lower temperatures than that for the samples in which the other is absent. This probably indicates a better contact between Pt and Mn in these samples than in P1M2ASI with a much lower Mn content.
Hydrogen consumption in TPR resulted in 0.23 and 0.81 mmol g1, for the samples P1M8ASI and P1M15ASI, respectively. With the same assumptions concerning the oxidation state of Pt, a H2/Mn-ratio of 0.18 and 0.40 has been obtained for P1M8ASI and P1M15ASI, respectively. These values confirm the promoting effect of Pt in the reduction of MnOx, which not only is shifted to lower temperatures, but also reduced to a higher degree. This effect is more pronounced as the Mn content of the catalyst is increased, probably by improving contact to platinum. This higher reducibility is probably related to the capacity of the oxide to provide O2 for the reaction.
TPD spectra for oxygen desorption from P1A, M2A, P1M2ASI and P1M8ASI catalysts are shown in
Fig. 3
. All samples present two desorption peaks. Curve (c), corresponding to P1M2ASI, presents a very similar desorption pattern to that of P1A (curve (a) in
Fig. 3
), indicating that its desorption behavior is related mainly to Pt. A higher Mn content (curve (d) in
Fig. 3
, for sample P1M8ASI) shows a clear contribution of Mn (curve (b) in
Fig. 3
) to the desorption pattern as well.

3.2. Activity test
3.2.1. CO oxidation reaction in an H2-free stream
Prior to selective CO oxidation, the ability of the prepared catalysts to oxidize CO in an H2-free stream was studied. The activity of the prepared catalyst for CO oxidation is shown in
Fig. 4
for a λ value equal 2. In order to avoid an excessive number of curves in the figure, only that corresponding to P1M2ASI is shown as representative of catalysts containing around 2 wt.% Mn. However, both TIgn (ignition temperature, defined as the temperature for the maximum slope in CO conversion versus temperature which has been related to the onset CO desorption) and T100 (temperature for total CO conversion) have been included in
Table 1
for all catalysts.

The catalyst P1A presents a conversion of 100% at 194 C for λ = 2, which is in accordance with the results of Anderson
[45]
, who obtains total CO conversion at 185 C for a 1 wt.%Pt/Al2O3 and λ = 2. The catalyst M2A requires much higher temperatures to be activecomplete conversion at 288 C for λ = 2. The activity of the catalysts prepared by Pt deposited on MnOx/Al2O3 depends on the Mn content: for P1M2ASI, the activity is similar to P1A100% conversion at 192 C for λ = 2although a small promoting effect in the low temperature range can be observed due to the contribution of the non-competitive dual-site mechanism through MnOx. As the temperature increases, the competitive LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism becomes more important and is finally prevailing. The sample M2P1ASI presents no promoting effect in the low temperature range. As the dual-site mechanism is expected to occur at the MnOxPt interface, this seems to indicate that no significant interface is formed with this preparation procedure. In the high temperature range, the catalyst M2P1ASI presents a somewhat lower activity than P1A, which points to a certain coverage of Pt atoms by MnOx during preparation. The sample P1M2ACI, in which Pt and Mn were simultaneously impregnated on the alumina, a certain Pt coverage seems be present as well, which is coherent with the preparation procedure, while the low-temperature promotion indicates a significant amount of MnOxPt interface. According to XRD in
Fig. 1
, this is the 2 wt.% Mn sample with the highest MnOx dispersion.
The increase in Mn content enhances the activity for CO oxidation, decreasing the temperature for complete CO depletion to 171 and 169 C, for the catalysts P1M8ASI and P1M15ASI and λ = 2, respectively. As the total amount of Pt is not changed, the shift of these curves to lower temperatures indicates that the contribution of the dual-site reaction mechanism is important in all the conversion ranges on these catalysts, and related to the total amount of the MnOxPt interface. It becomes apparent that increasing the Mn content beyond 8 wt.% produces a small increase of activity only, because the amount of interface is limited by Pt.
Tanaka et al.
[19]
have also shown that promoted Pt/alumina with a very small amount of Fe did not show an activity enhancement, but large amounts of Fe enhanced the activity greatly. As they suggested, the reaction takes place with the CO adsorbed onto Pt, and the oxygen activated at the PtFeOX interface.
3.3. Selective CO oxidation reaction
3.3.1. Feed free from CO2 and H2O
The performance of the catalysts in the selective CO oxidation (PROX) in streams free from CO2 and H2O was also tested. The experiments were carried out with a GHSV of 12,000 h1, and a gas composition of 1 vol.% CO, 60 vol.% H2, 1 vol.% O2 and He (to balance).
Fig. 5
(a) shows CO conversion versus temperature curves obtained in these experiments for all the studied catalysts but the sample P1M2ACI, whose values of temperature for maximum CO conversion (Tmax), selectivity and CO yield at that temperature have been included for ease of comparison in

All curves in
Fig. 5
(a) present an initial increase of CO conversion with temperature and, after reaching a maximum, a progressive decay can be observed as temperature rises. At low temperature, CO completely covers the metallic Pt surface and mainly CO oxidation takes place. When the temperature rises, CO desorption from Pt surface becomes important and it is partially replaced by H2, this effect favoring H2 oxidation.
If we compare the behavior of the catalysts in the absence and in the presence of H2 (
Fig. 4
,
Fig. 5
, and
Table 1
), we can see that the CO conversion curves for all catalysts but M2A (the one without Pt) are shifted to lower temperature in the presence of H2. Hydrogen, then, decreases the known CO self-poisoning effect on the Pt surface. Comparing the PROX behavior of all catalysts in
Fig. 5
(a), we can see that those with a higher content in MnOx (P1M8ASI and P1M15ASI) are more active than Pt/Al2O3, with the following order of activity: P1M15ASI > P1M8ASI > P1A > P1M2ASI > M2P1ASI  P1M2ACI  M2A. The relative position of the curves can be related, in this case, as the experimental conditions are more oxygen-demanding than those in the absence of H2, to the total amount of Pt (LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism) and PtMnOx interface (dual-site mechanism, Mars-van Krevelen type
[46]
, which is involved in the atomic oxygen supply to the reaction).
Thus, both P1M15ASI and P1M8ASI present a higher activity than P1A because they have an important contribution of PtMnOx interface to the activity, due to their high MnOx content, which acts as atomic oxygen supply. However, catalysts with around 2 wt.% Mn present lower activities than P1A. The main effect accounting for this in sample P1M2ASI is probably the lower Pt content of the catalyst, which cannot be compensated by the small amount of interface formed. As deduced from the behavior in the absence of H2, both M2P1ASI and P1M2ACI samples seemed to present some Pt coverage during preparation, accounting for their lower activity also in the presence of H2.
Sirijaruphan et al.
[31]
, for a Fe-promoted Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, also suggested that the promoter does not increase the number of active sites, and the activity was controlled by Ptoxide interface. The promotion of activity was found to be very noticeable at low temperature and low excess of oxygen, but decreased to become almost nil at high temperature and high oxygen excess
[19]
,
[47]
. This supports the mechanism in which the promoter (MnOx) activates the oxygen required for reaction: at low temperatures, as Pt metal is completely covered by CO, the oxygen is activated at the interface, whereas at higher temperatures the oxygen can also be activated on Pt sites.
The selectivity is represented in
Fig. 5
(b) for the studied catalysts. The shape of the selectivity curves is similar for all catalysts, with very high selectivity at low temperature until maximum CO conversion is achieved, followed by a constant-value region and then a constant decay as the temperature increases, due to enhancement of H2 oxidation.
We have also calculated the apparent activation energies for both CO and H2 oxidation, which are listed in
Table 2
. Assuming the differential reactor approach, we have calculated the CO oxidation rate (rCO) from the CO conversion curve, while the H2 oxidation rate
has been calculated with the mass balance to oxygen. The results indicate that, for all catalysts, the activation energy for CO oxidationranging from 46.3 to 77.1 kJ mol1is much lower than that for H2 oxidationranging from 78.6 to 110.0 kJ mol1. This result explains the observed monotonic decrease of selectivity with temperature: the higher the temperature, the higher the
-ratio.

Fig. 5
(c) shows the CO yield in dependence of temperature. All curves present a maximum at intermediate temperatures. Comparing the CO yield for all catalysts, we can see that the maximum yield of 40.3% is obtained for the catalyst P1M15ASI (operating with λ = 2), at 139 C. If this value is compared, for example, with that of the catalyst P1A, where only Pt sites act as atomic oxygen supply, with a maximum CO yield of 32.8% at 176 C, we can see the benefit of adding MnOx.
In
Fig. 6
, catalyst activity, selectivity and CO yield for the most active catalyst, i.e., P1M15ASI, as a function of λ valuevaried from 1 to 3are shown.
Fig. 6
(a) shows that the maximum value of CO conversion obtained strongly depends on λ. The higher the λ value, the higher the maximum CO conversion. When a stoichiometric amount of oxygen is added (λ = 1), a maximum CO conversion of 31.5% can be achieved; in the presence of H2, a λ value of 2 is not enough to achieve total CO conversion with this catalyst, but total CO conversion in the range 163226 C is obtained when a λ value of 3 is used. As shown in
Fig. 6
(b), the selectivity corresponding to maximum CO conversion temperature is inversely proportional to λ value, with 51% for λ = 1, and 33.3% for λ = 3. In
Fig. 6
(c), the CO yield for λ = 1, 2 and 3, is shown. The maximum CO yield is achieved for λ = 240.3% at 139 Calthough the maximum CO conversion corresponds to λ = 3. This is because the CO yield is a combination of both effects (CO conversion and selectivity).

Comparing the results in
Fig. 5
,
Fig. 6
, we can deduce that increasing the amount of MnOx added to a Pt/alumina catalyst produces the same effect than increasing the λ value. Thus, addition of MnOx to the base catalyst P1A will allow working with a lower amount of oxygen, with the benefit that this represents in actual application. It is not clear, if a higher amount of MnOx can improve the performance for λ = 2. This effect could be studied and optimized, and is mainly related to the amount of the formed PtMnOx interface.
Although a lot of literature has been published on the PROX reaction without CO2 and steam, the results obtained in such conditions are limited, because, in the actual gas after reforming, there is a relatively high concentration of CO2 and steam, which can affect catalyst performance and durability. The presence of these compounds can produce several effects: coverage of active sites, thus, decreasing catalyst activity; and/or the simultaneous occurrence of other reactions such as forward and reverse WGS, or methanation. Thus, the effect of the addition of CO2 and H2O to our experimental system has been studied.
3.3.2. Effect of CO2 addition
The effect of adding 5 vol.% CO2 to the feedstream for the conversion over the catalysts P1A, P1M2ASI, P1M8ASI, and P1M15ASI is represented in
Fig. 7
, for λ = 2. In this figure, the effect of CO2 on maximum CO conversion, the temperature at which this maximum CO conversion is achieved, and selectivity and CO yield at this temperature are shown. Although it has not been shown, it is worth noticing that the presence of CO2 affects the CO conversion in a different way depending on the temperature range considered. While at low temperatures (below the maximum), CO2 strongly inhibits the activity (except for P1A catalysts, which is not affected), at high temperatures, it activates the catalyst, and higher CO conversion could be reached. The general effect observed is a shift of the CO conversion curve to higher temperatures by the presence of CO2.

Feed: 1 vol.% CO, 1 vol.% O2, (5 vol.% CO2), (5 vol.% H2O), 60 vol.% H2, He (to balance). Total flow rate of 200 cm3 min1, GHSV = 12,000 h1.
In
Fig. 7
, we can observe that the catalyst P1A is the least affected by the presence of CO2 (maximum CO conversion, selectivity and CO yield remain almost constant, as well as the temperature for the maximum CO conversion), while the presence of MnOx modifies substantially the catalyst behavior when CO2 is added: the temperature for maximum CO conversion is shifted to higher valuesa maximum shift of 55 C for catalyst containing 15 wt.% Mnwhile the maximum CO conversion, selectivity and CO yield are increased notoriously.
The effects of the presence of CO2 reported in the literature depend on the catalyst nature. While it has been found to be always detrimental in CuCe and Au/MnOx catalysts
[38]
,
[48]
, where catalyst inhibition has been explained by a blocking effect of CO2 on CO adsorption sites or by carbonate formation over reducible metal oxide
[10]
, supported Pt catalysts have been reported to be resistant towards CO2 deactivation
[15]
,
[49]
. Considering the behavior of our catalysts, the main effect of CO2 seems to be a partial coverage of active sites, which produces a shift in the conversion to higher temperatures. This effect affects not only the CO conversion, but also the H2 conversion.
Probably the most interesting effect observed by CO2 addition in
Fig. 7
is that the maximum CO conversion (and yield) attained increases with increasing MnOx content, and it nearly reaches total conversion for the catalyst P1M15ASI. The effect is similar to that observed in the absence of CO2, but with higher conversions. It would be interesting to study, if higher MnOx contents could even improve these results. In any case, the limit in MnOx content producing improvement in the catalyst performance is expected to be that producing the maximum PtMnOx interface.
3.3.3. Effect of H2O addition
The performance of the catalysts P1A, P1M2ASI, P1M8ASI and P1M15ASI in the PROX reaction when steam to a concentration of 5 vol.% is added to the feedstream was also evaluated, for λ = 2, and the results are shown in
Fig. 7
(dark grey bars). In the absence of Mn (P1A), steam slightly improves the CO maximum conversion, as well as selectivity and CO yield, increasing the temperature for maximum CO conversion by 21 C. As the Mn content in the catalysts increases, the improvement in the maximum CO conversion, selectivity and yield decreases, until it is almost negligible for P1M8ASI, and finally a detrimental effect is observed for the catalyst with the highest Mn content (P1M15ASI). However, the effect of the presence of 5 vol.% steam on temperature for maximum CO conversion is very similar for all catalysts.
Different effects have been reported in the literature by the presence of steam. Grisel and Nieuwenhuys
[50]
, with Au/MnOx/Al2O3, observed inhibition of the catalyst activity in the presence of steam, and suggested that H2O poisons the oxygen-vacancies from MnOx. Park et al.
[48]
, for CuCe catalysts, suggest that H2O adsorbs on the CO adsorption sites, thus, inhibiting catalyst activity. However, other authors, for Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, report that catalyst activity is unaltered or slightly enhanced by the presence of steam
[49]
,
[51]
,
[52]
or even notoriously enhanced
[10]
.
For our catalysts, P1A is slightly enhanced by the presence of steam. It seems to reduce the self-poisoning effect of CO on the Pt surface at low temperature, and to affect H2 more strongly than CO at higher temperature. In the presence of Mn, a poisoning effect on MnOx, such as that reported by Grisel and Nieuwenhuys
[50]
occurs simultaneously, what would account for the detrimental effect of increasing the MnOx content in the catalysts. Lahousse et al.
[53]
also observed that H2O adsorbs onto MnOx.
One could expect that either forward or reverse WGS could affect global CO conversion. In this sense, partially reducible oxides, such as MnOx, have been reported to favor formation of hydroxyl groups on their surface that are particularly reactive for watergas shift
[54]
. With the aim to clear such a possibility, we have carried out two sets of experiments. In the first set, a mixture of 1 vol.% CO and 5 vol.% H2O, balanced with He, was fed to the reactor with to a total flow rate of 200 cm3 min1 (GHSV = 12,000 h1), and we have seen that the forward WGS began at temperatures higher than 230 C. In the second set, a feed mixture of 1 vol.% CO2 and 60 vol.% H2, balanced with He, was used with the same GHSV. The results have shown that no formation of CO (by reverse WGS) was observed below 240 C, and only very low amounts below 300 C. Thus, we can conclude that no significant contribution of either forward or reverse WGS takes place in these experimental conditions with our catalysts.
3.3.4. Deactivation test
The catalytic activity of P1M15ASI, the most active among the studied catalysts, was tested at constant temperature for 5 h in order to study the stability with time-on-stream. A reaction temperature of 140 C has been chosen as this is the temperature for maximum activity operating with λ = 2. The experiment showed that the P1M115ASI catalyst exhibits a stable performance with reaction time, showing a stable CO conversion and a selectivity of 88 and 44%, respectively.
4. Conclusions
The effect of the addition of 2, 8 and 15 wt.% Mn to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in the preferential oxidation of CO (PROX) in H2 streams for feeding PEM fuel cells has been studied. XRD patterns showed that Mn, in our catalysts, was mainly present as MnO2, with a small contribution of Mn2O3. The results of TPR indicated that reduction of MnOx is favored by the presence of Pt, which not only occurs at lower temperatures, but also to a higher extent. This effect increases with the Mn content of the catalysts, what points to a better contact between Pt and Mn in terms of a common interface. O2-TPD results indicated that MnOx did not appreciably contribute to O2 adsorption when the Mn content of the catalyst was very low.
CO oxidation was studied in the absence of H2 for all the catalysts prepared. The results obtained were in agreement with those of the characterization: when the Mn content of the catalysts was very low, no significant improvement was observed in the catalyst activity compared to Pt/Al2O3; the catalysts with 8 and 15 wt.% MnOx, however, present a clear improvement of activity. The results also suggest that incorporation of Mn on Pt/Al2O3 and that of Mn and Pt simultaneously by co-impregnation produce a certain coverage of Pt, which remains inactive for the reaction.
The performance of the catalysts was then studied in the PROX reaction in H2-rich streams. The presence of H2 produced a shift in the CO conversion versus temperature curves of all catalysts to lower values, which was attributed to inhibition of the known CO self-poisoning effect of the Pt surface, and a maximum in CO conversion, after which conversion decreased with temperature due to competition between CO and H2 for the available O2. However, the relative position of the curves remained almost unchanged, and activity was related to the PtMnOx interface. Studying the effect of the amount of oxygen fed to the system has shown that the effect of increasing the amount of Mn in the catalysts is similar to that of increasing the excess of oxygen fed to the system. Thus, catalysts with a higher Mn content can reach higher CO conversion and yield with lower λ values, what is very important in practical applications, when H2 streams are to be used as fuels for PEM cells. The maximum Mn content is expected to be limited by the maximum amount of PtMnOx interface, which can be formed. A study of the durability on a Pt/15 wt.%MnOx/Al2O3 catalyst has shown stable operation without deactivation for a period of 5 h.
The presence of 5 vol.% CO2 produces an increase in the maximum CO conversion obtained, which increases as the Mn content of the catalysts increases. The catalyst with 15 wt.% MnOx reaches nearly 100% CO conversion for λ = 2. It would be interesting to study to what extent this conversion can be increased by increasing the Mn content in the catalyst and, particularly, to what extent the excess of oxygen could be reduced.
The effect of the presence of 5 vol.% H2O in the feedstream strongly depends on the Mn content in the catalyst: without Mn (P1A), the maximum CO conversion, selectivity and yield are slightly improved by steam, which is attributed to inhibition by the CO self-poisoning effect on the Pt surface; the higher the Mn content, the lower the increase of the maximum CO conversion, selectivity and yield, with the catalyst containing the highest amount of Mn studied here (15 wt.% MnOx) presents a clear decrease of the three parameters in the presence of steam. This effect has been attributed to steam poisoning of the oxygen vacancies of MnOx. The absence of a contribution of either the forward or the reverse WGS reaction to CO conversion was experimentally checked with our catalysts and under our working conditions.
The effect of the simultaneous presence of CO2 and H2O could be an interesting line of future studies, particularly for the catalysts with higher Mn contents, together with the optimization of the Mn content with respect to practical applications.
