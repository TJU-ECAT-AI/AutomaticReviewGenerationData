[1] "Kaila et al. found that the addition of rhodium to platinum on zirconia reduced carbon formation and that the stability of the bimetallic catalyst was improved by increasing the Rh/Pt ratio"

The literature provides limited information specifically about bimetallic Pt-based catalysts for CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions. However, it does mention that adding Rh to Pt catalysts on zirconia support reduced carbon formation and improved stability for reforming reactions. This suggests bimetallic catalysts can enhance performance compared to monometallic ones.

The document does not contain information about UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces or potential insights they could provide. To fully answer this question would require additional research beyond the scope of this literature.

该文献对于双金属Pt基催化剂在CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化方面的信息有限。然而,它确实提到将Rh添加到氧化锆载体上的Pt催化剂中可以减少碳的形成并提高重整反应的稳定性。这表明双金属催化剂可以提高性能,相比于单金属催化剂。

文献中没有关于Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究或其可能提供的潜在见解的信息。要全面回答这个问题需要进行超出本文献范围的额外研究。
