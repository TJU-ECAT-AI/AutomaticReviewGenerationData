[1] "Kaila et al. found that the addition of rhodium to platinum on zirconia reduced carbon formation and that the stability of the bimetallic catalyst was improved by increasing the Rh/Pt ratio"

[2] "Noble metal catalysts have been found to be more sulfur tolerant than Ni-based catalysts"

[3] "Strohm et al. used a bimetallic NiRh catalyst on CeO2-modified Al2O3 and found that Ni would act as a sacrificial site by adsorbing sulfur preferentially allowing slower deactivation"

The literature provides some insights into bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, for reforming reactions:

1. Adding Rh to Pt/ZrO2 catalysts reduces carbon formation and improves stability.

2. Noble metal catalysts like Pt are more sulfur tolerant than Ni-based catalysts.

3. In NiRh bimetallic catalysts, Ni can act as a sacrificial site to preferentially adsorb sulfur, slowing deactivation.

However, the literature does not discuss CO oxidation, water gas shift, or methane conversion reactions specifically. It also does not mention UHV studies or model surfaces. To fully address the question, additional research would be needed on:

1. Mechanisms of CO oxidation, WGS, and methane conversion on Pt-based bimetallic catalysts
2. UHV studies correlating reactor findings with model surfaces 
3. Supported vs. model bimetallic Pt catalysts

Future UHV studies could potentially provide atomic-level insights into reaction mechanisms and active sites on bimetallic surfaces that are difficult to probe under reactor conditions. This could help bridge the gap between model and practical catalyst systems.

该文献对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂在重整反应中提供了一些见解：

1. 在Pt/ZrO2催化剂中添加Rh可以减少碳的形成并提高稳定性。

2. 贵金属催化剂如Pt比基于Ni的催化剂具有更强的抗硫性。

3. 在NiRh双金属催化剂中，Ni可以作为牺牲位点优先吸附硫，从而减缓失活。

然而，该文献并未具体讨论CO氧化、水煤气变换或甲烷转化反应。它也没有提到UHV研究或模型表面。要全面回答这个问题，还需要对以下方面进行额外研究：

1. 基于Pt的双金属催化剂上CO氧化、WGS和甲烷转化的机理
2. 将反应器研究结果与模型表面相关联的UHV研究
3. 负载型vs模型双金属Pt催化剂

未来的UHV研究可能为双金属表面上的反应机理和活性位点提供原子层面的洞察，这些在反应器条件下难以探测。这可能有助于弥合模型和实际催化剂系统之间的差距。
