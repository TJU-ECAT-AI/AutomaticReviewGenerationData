[1] "The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts; however a different addition manner was suggested for the later acceleration effect over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts."

[2] "Accordingly, Re is supposed to have some effect on these adsorbed CO, which accelerates the WGS reaction, especially in the case of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts."

[3] "WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction."

[4] "The role of Re would be the stabilization of formate species and accelerate the rate of H2 formation."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of water gas shift reactions in several ways:

1. Formation of bimetallic clusters: Pt-Re and Pd-Re bimetallic clusters form on TiO2 supports, which affects catalyst activity.

2. CO adsorption modification: Re addition changes how CO adsorbs on the catalyst surface, which can accelerate the WGS reaction, especially for PdRe/TiO2 catalysts.

3. Reaction mechanism alteration: Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts promote WGS reaction via formation of surface-formate anions, with the formate formation step being rate-determining.

4. Stabilization of intermediates: Re helps stabilize formate species and accelerates H2 formation rate.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights by:

1. Examining model surfaces of Pt-Re and Pd-Re bimetallics to understand atomic-scale interactions.
2. Investigating CO adsorption behavior on these model surfaces to correlate with reactor studies.
3. Studying formate formation and stability under controlled conditions to elucidate the role of Re.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may make direct comparisons challenging. Bridging the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts remains an important area for future research.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的催化剂，通过以下几种方式影响水煤气变换反应的机理和效率：

1. 形成双金属簇：在TiO2载体上形成Pt-Re和Pd-Re双金属簇，这影响了催化剂活性。

2. 改变CO吸附：Re的添加改变了CO在催化剂表面的吸附方式，这可以加速水煤气变换反应，尤其是对PdRe/TiO2催化剂。

3. 改变反应机理：添加Re的Pt和Pd催化剂通过形成表面甲酸根离子促进水煤气变换反应，其中甲酸根形成步骤是决速步骤。

4. 稳定中间体：Re有助于稳定甲酸根物种并加速H2的形成速率。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能通过以下方式提供洞见：

1. 研究Pt-Re和Pd-Re双金属的模型表面，以了解原子尺度的相互作用。
2. 研究这些模型表面上的CO吸附行为，以与反应器研究相关联。
3. 在受控条件下研究甲酸根的形成和稳定性，以阐明Re的作用。

然而，目前在基于Pt的双金属表面上进行UHV研究的局限性可能使直接比较具有挑战性。弥合模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距仍然是未来研究的一个重要领域。
