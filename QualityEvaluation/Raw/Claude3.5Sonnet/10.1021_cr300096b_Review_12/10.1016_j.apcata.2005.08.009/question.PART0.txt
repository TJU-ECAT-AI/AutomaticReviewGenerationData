Mechanistic study of watergas-shift reaction over TiO2 supported PtRe and PdRe catalysts
Abstract
Watergas-shift reactions over PtRe/TiO2 and PdRe/TiO2 catalysts were studied, using the closed gas circulation system and the fixed-bed flow-type reactor. The activity of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts was strongly affected by the Re content, while the activity of PtRe/TiO2 catalysts was less dependent on the addition ratio of Re, and more dependent on the temperature of reduction. The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts; however a different addition manner was suggested for the later acceleration effect over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts. The FT-IR analyses of the adsorbed species during the reaction exhibited the enhancement of the adsorbed CO peaks in lower wavenumber region with the increase of Re content. Accordingly, Re is supposed to have some effect on these adsorbed CO, which accelerates the WGS reaction, especially in the case of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts.
1. Introduction
The watergas-shift reaction (WGS reaction) has been applied to increase the hydrogen production for the synthesis of ammonia. Since it is moderately exothermic, the reaction is industrially achieved in two steps: namely, at 623723 K, the high temperature shift (HTS), and at 453503 K, the low temperature shift (LTS). FeCr and CuZn-based catalysts, in this order, are used in most of the industrial ammonia plants
[1]
. More recently, the interest on the WGS reaction has been renewed for application to fuel processing for fuel cell-power generation. Advanced LTS catalysts are needed to produce essentially CO-free hydrogen to feed the PEM fuel cells under development for automobiles. Desired catalyst characteristics include high activity and stability over a wider operating temperature window than is currently possible with the commercial LTS catalysts.
The WGS reaction is thought to occur mainly through two reaction mechanisms: the regenerative (red-ox) mechanism and the associative mechanism
[2]
,
[3]
. The generative mechanism involves successive oxidation and reduction of the surface, while the associative mechanism involves reaction through an adsorbed surface intermediate, as a formate mechanism. The possibility of participation of carbonate and bicarbonate intermediate complexes instead of formate is also under discussion. In the formate mechanism, H2O dissociates to form OH(a), which then reacts with CO to produce HCOO(a). Decomposition of formate then results in H2 and CO2 products. In the red-ox mechanism, H2O dissociates completely to O(a) and H(a) and the O(a) is then titrated by CO. Over Fe3O4 the regenerative mechanism is thought to be dominant, but on many other oxides the associative mechanism is thought to be more important.
Commercial, CuZn-based catalysts are not always applicable for fuel processors because they require special activation procedures, are pyrophoric, and are intolerant of poisons, condensation, and oxidation. Precious metal (PM) catalysts are thus popular in these days, because they are generally superior to base-metal catalysts for the long time use. Many catalytic systems have been investigated so far, however, an effective commercial catalyst is still under development. One catalyst receiving much attention as a potential candidate is cerium oxide loaded with reduction promoter metals. For example, rhodium

have been studied as catalysts for WGS reactions.
In the biphasic catalysts, as the metal supported on oxides, many studies have been made to understand the role and the synergetic effect of the two phases in the catalytic reaction. There is still disagreement as to the roles of ceria and the metal as promoters for the WGSR mechanism. The most recently proposed mechanism is the ceria-mediated redox process, whereby CO adsorbed on the metal is oxidized by ceria. The second step in the mechanism involves re-oxidation of ceria by water. It is proposed by Bunluesin et al.
[9]
that, in this redox mechanism, oxygen transfer from ceria to the metal interface, as well as the re-oxidation step, together control the WGS reaction rate. In an earlier formate type mechanism proposed on the reaction over Rh/CeO2, surface formate was formed by the reaction of CO(a) with active geminal ceria surface OH groups on a partially reduced ceria surface
[5]
. Recent in situ DRIFT-reaction studies of ceria, on the evolution of formates, indicated that formates are present on the surface of reduced ceria, and that at low temperatures and conversions it can be the reaction intermediate of WGS reaction
[13]
.
Beside the ceria supported precious metal catalysts, the PtRe/TiO2 system is known as a good catalyst showing activity close to Cu catalysts in low temperature
[14]
, and we have also found that PdRe/TiO2 and IrRe/TiO2 catalysts also have enough activity, depending on the Re content
[15]
. In the present study, we have investigated the mechanistic difference of WGS reaction over TiO2-supported Pt and Pd catalysts with and without Re addition, employing kinetic and infrared spectroscopic techniques, and we discuss the activity-determining factors and the role of added Re for these catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
All catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness method. The contents of active metals (Pt, Pd) were fixed to 21 wt.% for PdRe/TiO2 catalyst; for each catalyst, various Re contents (from 1 to 10 wt.%) were tested. The elemental analysis using ICP spectroscopy was carried out for all obtained catalysts to confirm the metal contents. The characterizations of catalysts were performed by XRD (Rigaku, RAD-Î³X), XPS (JEOL, JPS 9010MC), TEM (JEOL, JEM-2010) and CO-chemisorption methods (Beckman Coulter, Omnisorp 100CX).
PtRe/TiO2 catalysts were prepared as follows: spherically molded TiO2 support (CS-300S-12, Sakai Chemicals) was dried under air atmosphere at 393 K for over 12 h, and cooled to room temperature in the N2-flowing dry box (NH4)ReO4 (Kojima Chemicals) was dissolved into distilled water with measured pore volume of the support. The solution was poured over the support 34 times and then the support was dried at 393 K for over 12 h. After that, the solution of H2PtCl6 was supported successively in the same manner. The supported catalyst was calcined with flowing air at 773 K for 1 h. Before the WGS reaction, the catalyst was reduced in situ by flowing H2 at 573 K for low temperature reduction (LTR) or at 773 K for high temperature reduction (HTR). PdRe/TiO2 catalysts were prepared in a similar manner employing Pd(NO3)2 (Mitsuwa Chemicals) as metal precursors instead of H2PtCl6.
2.2. Reaction apparatus
In the case of closed gas circulation system reactions, catalyst activities were evaluated as initial H2 formation reaction rate in COH2O reaction (10 Torr each). Gas analysis was carried out with an on line TCD gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-17 A) to obtain gas compositions for H2, CO and CO2. On the circulating line, a catalyst disk (20 mm diameter) was installed, and adsorbed species were analyzed through the cell by IR spectroscopy (JASCO, FT/IR-610). In order to confirm the catalyst's activity in the actual condition, reaction in the fixed-bed flow-type reactor was also carried out. Twelve milliliter of catalyst was fixed in the 1 in. cylindrical reaction tube, and set in the furnace whose temperature and atmosphere were precisely controlled. As input gas, a mixed gas of 49% H2/10% CO/10% CO2/31% H2O was used, which is close to actual output gas from steam reforming reactions of hydrocarbons. This was fed to the reactor at 500 mL/min as the wet gas (GHSV = 2500 h1). Gas analysis was carried out with a micro-gas-chromatograph (Agilent 3000).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Kinetic study of WGS reaction over PtRe(2:X)/TiO2 (X = 03)
Fig. 1
(A) shows the time courses of WGS reaction at 323 K over PtRe(2:X)/TiO2 (X = 03 wt.%) catalysts after LTR pretreatment (573 K) in a closed gas circulation system. Along with the decrease of CO, equimolar amounts of H2 and of CO2 were formed in the COH2O (10 Torr each) reaction. The initial rates of H2 formation increased gradually with the increase of Re content up to 2 wt.% and then decreased to a small extent over 3 wt.% catalyst. As will be discussed later, the metal particle sizes also increased with the addition of Re, which is the main reason of the decrease of the H2 formation rate over 3 wt.% catalyst. The reaction behavior was completely different after HTR pretreatment (773 K) as shown in
Fig. 1
(B). At the initial stage of the reaction, a certain amount of H2 was formed quickly over all the catalysts, maybe because of the oxidation of SMSI surface by water. In the case of Pt/TiO2 catalysts, it is recognized that the SMSI effect accelerates the H2 formation rate about two times compared to that of
Fig. 1
(A)-(a). However, little acceleration effect was observed in the cases of Re-added catalysts, suggesting that the influence of SMSI for the enhancement effect is much larger than the addition effect of Re over HTR catalysts.

Fig. 2
(A) shows the Arrhenius plots of H2 formation rates over various catalysts after LTR pretreatment. The initial rate of H2 formation under LTR condition increased with the increase of Re content and the activation energy decreases simultaneously as follows: PtRe(2:0)/TiO2 = 45.7 kJ/mol, PtRe(2:1) = 36.2 kJ/mol, PtRe(2:2) = 29.8 kJ/mol and PtRe(2:3) = 31.0 kJ/mol. On the other hand, under HTR condition, the activation energy over PtRe(2:0)/TiO2 reduced by more than half (21.2 kJ/mol) by the SMSI effect. However, the effect of Re addition on the activation energy was very small, as follows: PtRe(2:1) = 21.0 kJ/mol, PtRe(2:2) = 20.2 kJ/mol, PtRe(2:3) = 20.0 kJ/mol. These results again indicate that SMSI effect is more predominant than the Re addition effect under HTR condition.

Because the actual input gas, in most cases of practical reformers, must contain CO2 and excess H2 along with CO and H2O, and these may more or less affect the WGS activity of the catalysts, it is necessary to confirm the reaction rate using the model gas in a fixed-bed flow type reactor. Accordingly, a model mixed gas of COH2OH2CO2 was employed and the concentration of residual CO contained in the reaction off-gas were measured over various Pt catalysts after LTR and HTR pretreatments, changing the furnace temperature in 10 K steps from 373 to 523 K. The results are summarized in
Fig. 3
(A) and (B). The situation was quite different from the reactions in the closed gas circulation system at lower temperatures. Under LTR condition, the change of the CO concentration only started at around 373 K; the most active catalysts was PtRe(2:0)/TiO2, and the addition of Re affected the reaction rate negatively. This can be explained by the differences of activation energies among these catalysts. As shown in
Fig. 2
(A), PtRe(2:0)/TiO2 catalyst may exhibit higher activity than Re added catalysts at higher reaction temperatures because of its highest activation energy. Under HTR condition, every catalyst exhibited higher activity than the corresponding LTR catalyst as shown in
Fig. 3
(B), and results revealed that PtRe(2:1)/TiO2(HTR) is the most efficient catalyst for CO removal at the temperature range of 373473 K.

Fig. 4
(A) shows the time courses of WGSR over various PdRe(1:X)/TiO2 catalysts at 473 K after LTR pretreatments (X = 0, 1, 10 wt.%). Obvious acceleration by addition of Re was seen in PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalyst, and the reaction rates were several times larger over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts. This situation was quite different from the case of PtRe/TiO2 catalysts, where acceleration by Re addition was only two times over PtRe(2:2)/TiO2 catalysts; the rates saturated at these values over higher PtRe ratio catalysts (
Fig. 1
(A)).
Fig. 4
(B) summarizes the Arrhenius plots of H2 formation rates over these catalysts, where the activation energies are as follows: PdRe(1:0)/TiO2 = 37.2 kJ/mol, PdRe(1:1) = 31.1 kJ/mol, and PdRe(1:10) = 38.3 kJ/mol. Initial decrease of the activation energy by the addition of Re corresponds well to the case of PtRe catalysts; however, later increase suggests that the excess Re may be added in a different manner from the case of PtRe catalysts. It is interesting to note that there is no distinct enhancement effect by HTR pretreatments as the case of PtRe catalysts.

3.2. Characterization of catalysts
Fig. 5
demonstrates the XRD patterns of various PtRe and PdRe catalysts employed in the present study. Although no XRD pattern was observed except that of TiO2 support in the cases of PtRe(2:0)/TiO2 and PtRe(2:1)/TiO2 catalysts, Pt metal peaks were observed at around 2Î¸ = 40 when Re content was more than 2 wt.%. This result suggests the possibility that the particle size of Pt metal increases by the addition of Re. The TEM observation was also carried out as shown in
Fig. 6
; the average particle diameters of Pt were calculated as summarized in
Table 1
. The results clearly show that the Pt diameter becomes larger with the increase of Re content, and the corresponding metal dispersion decreases. A spot elemental analysis by EDX disclosed that a metal particle consisted of ca. 1:1 bimetallic clusters of Pt and Re.

The XPS analyses of PtRe(2:0)/TiO2 and PtRe(2:3)/TiO2 were carried out employing an in situ XPS cell. As summarized in
Fig. 7
(A), Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 transitions in Pt(2:0)/TiO2 catalyst exhibited the binding energies of 70.974.1 eV, which are exactly the same positions as those of zero valent Pt metal. Addition of Re caused the shift of these transitions to the lower binding energy side, suggesting the existence of negatively charged Pt in PtRe(2:3)/TiO2 catalyst (
Fig. 7
(B)-(a)). At the same time the binding energy of Re 4f7/2 transition was shifted to slightly higher binding energy side (40.8 eV), indicating the existence of positively charged Re species. These results again suggest the formation of certain surface bimetallic clusters on the surface of TiO2 support.

(B)-(b) represents the spectra change after 10 Torr of H2O vapor treatment inside the in situ XPS cell at 373 K. Although the binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 transition did not change much, that of Re 4f7/2 shifted to 0.4 eV higher binding energy side, indicating the oxidation of surface Re by water.

The situation was different in the cases of PdRe(1:0)/TiO2 and PdRe(1:10)/TiO2. No Pd or Re peak was observed in the XRD pattern of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts, even when the Re content was as much as 10 wt.% (
Fig. 5
). As shown in
Fig. 8
, high resolution TEM images of PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 revealed the expansion of Pd(1 1 0) lattice planes from 2.38 to 2.60 A. EDX analysis demonstrated the formation of PdRe bimetallic clusters, whose composition was estimated to be Pd:Re = ca. 0.7:0.3. In addition, the rest of Re seems to remain independently on the support as rhenium oxides. This result is supported by XPS study results in
Fig. 9
. Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 transitions in PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalyst were observed just on the positions of metallic Pd (351340.2 eV). At the same time, the binding energy of Re 4f7/2 transition was shifted to slightly higher binding energy side, indicating the existence of positively charged Re species.

Table 1
summarizes the TOFs of H2 formation in WGS reaction over various supported Pt and Pd catalysts with different particle sizes. As mentioned already in the cases of Pt catalysts, the metal particle sizes increased along with the increase of Re content. Accordingly, the addition effect for the H2 formation rate was saturated at around Pt:Re = 2:2 ratio, but their TOFs still increased, indicating the formation of a certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re. Similar results were obtained in the cases of PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 and PdRe(5:5)/TiO2 catalysts; the TOF of H2 formation was increased with the increase of particle sizes.
3.3. Infrared spectroscopic study
In situ FT-IR spectroscopy was employed to analyze the adsorbed species during WGS reactions over TiO2 supported Pt and Pd catalysts with and without Re addition.
Fig. 11
shows the FT-IR spectra of CO adsorbed onto the freshly reduced catalysts, followed by an evacuation at elevated temperatures. In the case of PtRe(2:0)/TiO2, when 10 Torr of CO was introduced onto the reduced surface at room temperature, a sharp IR peak was observed at 2090 cm1 which can be assigned to linearly adsorbed CO on top of Pt surface atoms ((A)-(a)). As the evacuation temperature was raised, the peak intensity decreased gradually from 373 K ((A)-(c)) and disappeared at around 473523 K ((A)-(e) and (f)). In the case of PtRe(2:1)/TiO2, the linearly adsorbed CO peak shifted to 2083 cm1 with a small shoulder at 2103 cm1 (B)-(a)), and the intensity of the linear peak became a little bit stronger than the case of PtRe(2:0)/TiO2. The adsorption strength was also increased by the addition of Re, and linear peak disappeared at around 523573 K ((B)-(e) and (f)). This tendency was pronounced even more in the case of PtRe(2:3)/TiO2. When 10 Torr of CO was introduced to the reduced surface, linear CO peak was observed at 2070 cm1, accompanied with the shoulder peaks at 2006 and 1956 cm1. The latter two peaks may be assigned to adsorbed CO on top of the smaller Pt clusters and bridged CO, respectively.

represents the FT-IR spectra during the WGS reaction at 373 K. Over PtRe(2:0)/TiO2, the adsorbed CO band shifted to 2076 cm1, accompanied with a small shoulder at 2042 cm1, which disappeared quickly by the evacuation of the gas phase ((A)-(b)). A large IR band at 1618 cm1 can be assigned to adsorbed H2O whose intensity also decreased by evacuation. In the case of PtRe(2:1)/TiO2 during WGS reaction, linear CO(a) peak at 2069 cm1 was very much pronounced with small shoulders at 1910 and 1888 cm1. Over PtRe(2:3)/TiO2 catalyst during WGS reaction at 373 K, the linear CO(a) peak split into two peaks at 2062 and 2030 cm1 accompanied with the appearance of doublet bridged CO(a) peaks at 1920 and 1880 cm1. Adsorbed water molecules gave the IR band at 1620 cm1 whose intensity was not so large as the case of PtRe(2:0)/TiO2. The small peaks at 1541 and 1385 cm1 may be assigned to the adsorbed formate species.

Similar results were obtained in the cases of TiO2-supported Pd catalysts as shown in
Fig. 13
. The intensity of adsorbed CO at 2100 cm1 over Pd/TiO2 was very weak (
Fig. 13
(A)), whereas a large peak was observed at 2056 cm1 with two shoulders at 2005 and 1970 cm1 over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 (
Fig. 13
(B)). This result may indicate an increase of CO adsorption strength due to the addition of Re. The following TPD experiment also confirmed the significant strengthening of adsorbed CO by the addition of Re. During WGS reaction at 373 K over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2, three adsorbed CO peaks were observed at 2028 (linear CO(a)) and 1918 and 1891 cm1 (bridged CO(a)), similar to the case of PtRe catalyst (
Fig. 13
(D)). In summary, it is remarkable that three lower peaks appear over both PtRe and PdRe catalysts only in the following cases; (i) when the catalyst contains Re, and (ii) not after the simple CO adsorption but after the WGS reaction. So we can say that these three peaks have at least some correlation with the effect of Re-addition to the WGS reaction system. From these experimental results, we can conclude that similar surface structures of catalytically active sites may be formed between Pt or Pd and Re in an atomic scale, which are effective for the enhancement of WGS reaction.

To investigate the mechanism of WGS reaction over PtRe(2:0)/TiO2 and PtRe(2:3)/TiO2, we carried out the following FT-IR spectroscopic experiments by step-by-step introducing H2O and CO reactants on to the reduced catalyst. First of all, only H2O was adsorbed on both catalyst surfaces at 298 K, and then CO was introduced and the mixture was warmed up to 423473 K. In the case of PtRe(2:0)/TiO2 catalyst, the intensity of adsorbed H2O peaks (1648 cm1) decreased significantly with the increased of adsorbed CO band (2080 cm1). Similar changes were observed over Re-added catalysts; however, two additional peaks were newly observed at 1558 and 1360 cm1 (see spectrum (c) in
Fig. 14
(B)) that can be assigned to the surface formate anion. When the catalyst was cooled to room temperature, and H2O was introduced again, the formate anion was quickly decomposed, accompanied with the evolution of H2 and CO2 in the gas phase (
Fig. 14
(B)-(d)). These processes were observed repeatedly as shown in
Fig. 14
(C)-(f)(j). Such results strongly suggest that formate anion formed from adsorbed H2O with gas-phase CO can be the reaction intermediate of WGS reaction over PtRe(2:3)/TiO2, whose formation step would be the rate-determining step of this reaction. The role of Re would be the stabilization of formate species and accelerate the rate of H2 formation.

4. Conclusions
1.
WGS activity was increased by addition of Re to both Pt/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts.
2.
While the effect of Re-addition is very remarkable in Pd/TiO2, the effect is not so clear in Pt/TiO2, and is rather dependent upon the reducing temperature.
3.
In the cases of Pt catalysts, the metal particle sizes increased, accompanied with the increase of Re contents. Accordingly, although H2 formation rate was saturated at around Pt:Re = 2:2 ratio, their TOFs still increased, indicating the formation of a certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re.
4.
Obvious acceleration was observed in PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalyst, which became several times larger over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2. The formation of bimetallic clusters may be responsible for the initial acceleration of H2 formation rate; however a different addition manner was suggested for the later acceleration effect over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts.
5.
Different types of CO adsorption occurred by addition of Re, which are observed in the IR spectra taken after WGS reaction.
6.
WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
