[1] "The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts; however a different addition manner was suggested for the later acceleration effect over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts."

[2] "Accordingly, Re is supposed to have some effect on these adsorbed CO, which accelerates the WGS reaction, especially in the case of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts."

[3] "WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction."

[4] "The role of Re would be the stabilization of formate species and accelerate the rate of H2 formation."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of water gas shift (WGS) reaction in several ways:

1. Formation of bimetallic clusters: Pt-Re and Pd-Re bimetallic clusters form on TiO2 supports, which affects catalyst activity.

2. CO adsorption modification: Re addition alters CO adsorption on the catalyst surface, which can accelerate the WGS reaction, especially for PdRe/TiO2 catalysts.

3. Reaction mechanism: For Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, the WGS reaction proceeds through a surface-formate intermediate. The formation of this formate species is the rate-determining step.

4. Stabilization of intermediates: Re appears to stabilize formate species on the catalyst surface, which helps accelerate the rate of H2 formation.

While the literature does not directly address CO oxidation or methane conversion, the insights gained from WGS studies suggest that bimetallic catalysts can significantly alter reaction pathways and kinetics.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide valuable insights by:

1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of model Pt-Re and Pd-Re bimetallic surfaces.
2. Examining the adsorption and reaction of CO, H2O, and other relevant species on these model surfaces.
3. Correlating UHV findings with reactor studies to bridge the gap between model and real catalytic systems.

However, the literature does not mention current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, so it's unclear what specific challenges might need to be overcome in future research.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，通过以下几种方式影响水煤气变换（WGS）反应的机理和效率：

1. 形成双金属簇：在TiO2载体上形成Pt-Re和Pd-Re双金属簇，这影响了催化剂的活性。

2. 改变CO吸附：Re的添加改变了催化剂表面的CO吸附，这可以加速WGS反应，尤其是对PdRe/TiO2催化剂。

3. 反应机理：对于添加Re的Pt和Pd催化剂，WGS反应通过表面甲酸盐中间体进行。这种甲酸盐物种的形成是反应的决速步骤。

4. 稳定中间体：Re似乎能稳定催化剂表面的甲酸盐物种，这有助于加速H2的生成速率。

虽然文献没有直接涉及CO氧化或甲烷转化，但从WGS研究中获得的见解表明，双金属催化剂可以显著改变反应途径和动力学。

未来的UHV研究可能通过以下方式提供有价值的见解：

1. 研究模型Pt-Re和Pd-Re双金属表面的表面结构和组成。
2. 研究CO、H2O和其他相关物种在这些模型表面上的吸附和反应。
3. 将UHV研究结果与反应器研究相关联，以弥合模型系统和实际催化系统之间的差距。

然而，文献没有提到当前在Pt基双金属表面UHV研究方面的局限性，因此尚不清楚未来研究可能需要克服哪些具体挑战。
