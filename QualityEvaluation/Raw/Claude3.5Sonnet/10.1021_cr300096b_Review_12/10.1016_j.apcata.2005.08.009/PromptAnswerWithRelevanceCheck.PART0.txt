[1] "The WGS reaction is thought to occur mainly through two reaction mechanisms: the regenerative (red-ox) mechanism and the associative mechanism"

[2] "The most recently proposed mechanism is the ceria-mediated redox process, whereby CO adsorbed on the metal is oxidized by ceria. The second step in the mechanism involves re-oxidation of ceria by water."

[3] "PtRe/TiO2 system is known as a good catalyst showing activity close to Cu catalysts in low temperature"

[4] "Under LTR condition, the change of the CO concentration only started at around 373 K; the most active catalysts was PtRe(2:0)/TiO2, and the addition of Re affected the reaction rate negatively."

[5] "Similar results were obtained in the cases of TiO2-supported Pd catalysts as shown in Fig. 13. The intensity of adsorbed CO at 2100 cm1 over Pd/TiO2 was very weak (Fig. 13(A)), whereas a large peak was observed at 2056 cm1 with two shoulders at 2005 and 1970 cm1 over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 (Fig. 13(B)). This result may indicate an increase of CO adsorption strength due to the addition of Re."

[6] "WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, have significant influences on the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation and water gas shift reactions:

1. For the water gas shift (WGS) reaction, bimetallic catalysts introduce complexity to the reaction mechanisms. While the reaction generally proceeds through either regenerative (redox) or associative mechanisms, the addition of a second metal like Re to Pt can alter these pathways.

2. The PtRe/TiO2 system shows good catalytic activity for WGS reactions at low temperatures, comparable to Cu catalysts. However, the effect of Re addition is not always positive. Under low temperature reduction (LTR) conditions, PtRe(2:0)/TiO2 was found to be the most active catalyst, with Re addition negatively affecting the reaction rate.

3. The addition of Re to Pt and Pd catalysts increases the CO adsorption strength. This is evidenced by the shift and intensification of CO adsorption peaks in infrared spectroscopy studies.

4. For Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, the WGS reaction proceeds through the formation of surface-formate anions. The formation of these formates is considered the rate-determining step of the reaction.

5. The influence of bimetallic catalysts on methane conversions is not directly addressed in the provided literature.

Regarding future UHV studies, they could potentially provide valuable insights by:

1. Allowing for precise control and characterization of bimetallic surface compositions and structures.

2. Enabling detailed studies of adsorption energies and configurations of reactants and intermediates on well-defined bimetallic surfaces.

3. Facilitating the investigation of reaction mechanisms and kinetics under controlled conditions, which could then be correlated with reactor studies.

4. Helping to elucidate the role of each metal in the bimetallic catalyst and how they interact to influence reactivity.

However, it's important to note that UHV studies have limitations in directly replicating reactor conditions, particularly in terms of pressure and the presence of a support material. Therefore, bridging the gap between UHV studies and supported catalysts under realistic conditions remains a challenge in correlating these findings.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，对CO氧化和水煤气变换反应的机理和效率有显著影响：

1. 对于水煤气变换（WGS）反应，双金属催化剂使反应机理变得复杂。虽然反应通常通过再生（氧化还原）或联合机制进行，但像Re这样的第二种金属添加到Pt中可以改变这些途径。

2. PtRe/TiO2系统在低温下表现出良好的WGS反应催化活性，可与Cu催化剂相媲美。然而，Re的添加效果并不总是正面的。在低温还原（LTR）条件下，PtRe(2:0)/TiO2被发现是最活跃的催化剂，而Re的添加对反应速率产生了负面影响。

3. 向Pt和Pd催化剂中添加Re会增强CO的吸附强度。这一点在红外光谱研究中CO吸附峰的移位和增强中得到了证实。

4. 对于添加Re的Pt和Pd催化剂，WGS反应是通过表面甲酸根离子的形成进行的。这些甲酸根的形成被认为是反应的速率决定步骤。

5. 所提供的文献中没有直接讨论双金属催化剂对甲烷转化的影响。

关于未来的UHV研究，它们可能提供有价值的见解，通过：

1. 允许精确控制和表征双金属表面组成和结构。

2. 能够详细研究反应物和中间体在明确定义的双金属表面上的吸附能和构型。

3. 在受控条件下促进反应机理和动力学的研究，这可以与反应器研究相关联。

4. 帮助阐明双金属催化剂中每种金属的作用，以及它们如何相互作用以影响反应性。

然而，重要的是要注意，UHV研究在直接复制反应器条件方面存在局限性，特别是在压力和支持材料的存在方面。因此，在将这些发现相互关联时，弥合UHV研究与实际条件下的负载催化剂之间的差距仍然是一个挑战。

[1] "The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts; however a different addition manner was suggested for the later acceleration effect over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts."

[2] "Accordingly, Re is supposed to have some effect on these adsorbed CO, which accelerates the WGS reaction, especially in the case of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of water gas shift (WGS) reaction in several ways:

1. Formation of bimetallic clusters: Pt-Re and Pd-Re bimetallic clusters form on TiO2 supports, which affects catalyst activity.

2. CO adsorption modification: Re addition alters CO adsorption on the catalyst surface, which can accelerate the WGS reaction, especially for PdRe/TiO2 catalysts.

3. Reaction mechanism: For Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, the WGS reaction proceeds through a surface-formate intermediate. The formation of this formate species is the rate-determining step.

4. Stabilization of intermediates: Re appears to stabilize formate species on the catalyst surface, which helps accelerate the rate of H2 formation.

While the literature does not directly address CO oxidation or methane conversion, the insights gained from WGS studies suggest that bimetallic catalysts can significantly alter reaction pathways and kinetics.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide valuable insights by:

1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of model Pt-Re and Pd-Re bimetallic surfaces.
2. Examining the adsorption and reaction of CO, H2O, and other relevant species on these model surfaces.
3. Correlating UHV findings with reactor studies to bridge the gap between model and real catalytic systems.

However, the literature does not mention current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, so it's unclear what specific challenges might need to be overcome in future research.

These UHV studies could help correlate reactor findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts by providing detailed information on surface structures, adsorption properties, and reaction intermediates under controlled conditions. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may include challenges in creating and characterizing complex bimetallic structures and bridging the pressure gap between UHV and reactor conditions.
