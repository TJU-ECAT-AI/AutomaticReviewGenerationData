          [1] "The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts; however a different addition manner was suggested for the later acceleration effect over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts."

[2] "The activity of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts was strongly affected by the Re content, while the activity of PtRe/TiO2 catalysts was less dependent on the addition ratio of Re, and more dependent on the temperature of reduction."

[3] "The FT-IR analyses of the adsorbed species during the reaction exhibited the enhancement of the adsorbed CO peaks in lower wavenumber region with the increase of Re content. Accordingly, Re is supposed to have some effect on these adsorbed CO, which accelerates the WGS reaction, especially in the case of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts."

[4] "WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction."

[5] "The role of Re would be the stabilization of formate species and accelerate the rate of H2 formation."

[6] "PtRe/TiO2 system is known as a good catalyst showing activity close to Cu catalysts in low temperature"

[7] "Under LTR condition, the change of the CO concentration only started at around 373 K; the most active catalysts was PtRe(2:0)/TiO2, and the addition of Re affected the reaction rate negatively."

          Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation and water gas shift (WGS) reactions in several ways:

1. Formation of bimetallic clusters: Pt-Re and Pd-Re bimetallic clusters form on TiO2 supports, affecting catalyst activity.

2. Differential effects of Re content: 
   - PdRe/TiO2 catalysts are strongly influenced by Re content.
   - PtRe/TiO2 catalysts are less affected by Re ratio but more by reduction temperature.
   - PtRe/TiO2 shows good catalytic activity for WGS reactions at low temperatures, comparable to Cu catalysts.
   - Under low temperature reduction (LTR) conditions, PtRe(2:0)/TiO2 was the most active catalyst, with Re addition negatively affecting the reaction rate.

3. CO adsorption modification: 
   - Re addition enhances adsorbed CO peaks at lower wavenumbers.
   - This suggests Re affects CO adsorption and accelerates the WGS reaction, especially for PdRe/TiO2 catalysts.

4. Reaction mechanism: 
   - Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts promote WGS reaction through surface-formate anion formation.
   - The formation of formate species is the rate-determining step of the WGS reaction.

5. Stabilization of intermediates: Re appears to stabilize formate species on the catalyst surface, which helps accelerate the rate of H2 formation.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights by:
1. Investigating the atomic-scale structure of bimetallic clusters on model surfaces.
2. Examining the effects of different Re contents and reduction temperatures on surface properties.
3. Studying CO adsorption behavior on well-defined bimetallic surfaces.
4. Probing the formation and stability of surface intermediates like formate anions.

These UHV studies could help correlate reactor findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts by providing detailed information on surface structures, adsorption properties, and reaction intermediates under controlled conditions. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may include challenges in creating and characterizing complex bimetallic structures and bridging the pressure gap between UHV and reactor conditions.

          双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，通过以下几种方式影响CO氧化和水煤气变换（WGS）反应的机理和效率：

1. 形成双金属簇：在TiO2载体上形成Pt-Re和Pd-Re双金属簇，影响催化剂活性。

2. Re含量的差异效应：
   - PdRe/TiO2催化剂受Re含量的强烈影响。
   - PtRe/TiO2催化剂受Re比例的影响较小，但更受还原温度的影响。
   - PtRe/TiO2在低温下表现出良好的WGS反应催化活性，可与Cu催化剂相媲美。
   - 在低温还原（LTR）条件下，PtRe(2:0)/TiO2是最活跃的催化剂，而Re的添加对反应速率产生了负面影响。

3. CO吸附修饰：
   - Re的添加增强了较低波数的吸附CO峰。
   - 这表明Re影响CO吸附并加速WGS反应，尤其是对PdRe/TiO2催化剂。

4. 反应机理：
   - 添加Re的Pt和Pd催化剂通过表面甲酸根阴离子的形成促进WGS反应。
   - 甲酸盐物种的形成是WGS反应的决速步骤。

5. 稳定中间体：Re似乎能稳定催化剂表面的甲酸盐物种，这有助于加速H2的生成速率。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能通过以下方式提供见解：
1. 研究模型表面上双金属簇的原子尺度结构。
2. 检查不同Re含量和还原温度对表面性质的影响。
3. 研究CO在定义明确的双金属表面上的吸附行为。
4. 探测表面中间体（如甲酸根阴离子）的形成和稳定性。

这些UHV研究可以通过在受控条件下提供表面结构、吸附性质和反应中间体的详细信息，帮助将反应器研究结果与模型表面和负载催化剂相关联。然而，当前UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的限制可能包括创建和表征复杂双金属结构的挑战，以及bridging UHV和反应器条件之间的压力差异。
