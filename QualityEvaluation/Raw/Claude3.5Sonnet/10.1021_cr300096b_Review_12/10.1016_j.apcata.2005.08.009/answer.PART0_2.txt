[1] "The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts; however a different addition manner was suggested for the later acceleration effect over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts."

[2] "The activity of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts was strongly affected by the Re content, while the activity of PtRe/TiO2 catalysts was less dependent on the addition ratio of Re, and more dependent on the temperature of reduction."

[3] "The FT-IR analyses of the adsorbed species during the reaction exhibited the enhancement of the adsorbed CO peaks in lower wavenumber region with the increase of Re content. Accordingly, Re is supposed to have some effect on these adsorbed CO, which accelerates the WGS reaction, especially in the case of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts."

[4] "WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of water gas shift (WGS) reaction in several ways:

1. Formation of bimetallic clusters: PtRe and PdRe bimetallic clusters form on TiO2 supports, which affects catalyst activity. 

2. Differential effects of Re content: PdRe/TiO2 catalysts are strongly influenced by Re content, while PtRe/TiO2 catalysts are less affected by Re ratio but more by reduction temperature.

3. CO adsorption modification: Re addition enhances adsorbed CO peaks at lower wavenumbers, suggesting Re affects CO adsorption and accelerates the WGS reaction, especially for PdRe/TiO2 catalysts.

4. Reaction mechanism: Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts promote WGS reaction through surface-formate anion formation, with this formation step being rate-determining.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights by:

1. Investigating the atomic-scale structure of bimetallic clusters on model surfaces.
2. Examining the effects of different Re contents and reduction temperatures on surface properties.
3. Studying CO adsorption behavior on well-defined bimetallic surfaces.
4. Probing the formation and stability of surface intermediates like formate anions.

These UHV studies could help correlate reactor findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts by providing detailed information on surface structures, adsorption properties, and reaction intermediates under controlled conditions. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may include challenges in creating and characterizing complex bimetallic structures and bridging the pressure gap between UHV and reactor conditions.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，以几种方式影响水气变换（WGS）反应的机理和效率：

1. 双金属簇的形成：PtRe和PdRe双金属簇在TiO2载体上形成，影响催化剂活性。

2. Re含量的差异效应：PdRe/TiO2催化剂受Re含量的强烈影响，而PtRe/TiO2催化剂受Re比例的影响较小，但更受还原温度的影响。

3. CO吸附修饰：Re的添加增强了较低波数的吸附CO峰，表明Re影响CO吸附并加速WGS反应，尤其是对PdRe/TiO2催化剂。

4. 反应机理：添加Re的Pt和Pd催化剂通过表面甲酸根阴离子的形成促进WGS反应，该形成步骤是决速步骤。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供以下见解：

1. 研究模型表面上双金属簇的原子尺度结构。
2. 检查不同Re含量和还原温度对表面性质的影响。
3. 研究CO在定义明确的双金属表面上的吸附行为。
4. 探测表面中间体（如甲酸根阴离子）的形成和稳定性。

这些UHV研究可以通过在受控条件下提供表面结构、吸附性质和反应中间体的详细信息，帮助将反应器研究结果与模型表面和负载催化剂相关联。然而，当前UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的限制可能包括创建和表征复杂双金属结构的挑战，以及bridging UHV和反应器条件之间的压力差异。
