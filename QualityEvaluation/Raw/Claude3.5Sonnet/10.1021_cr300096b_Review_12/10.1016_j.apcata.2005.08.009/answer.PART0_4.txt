[1] "The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts; however a different addition manner was suggested for the later acceleration effect over PdRe(1:10)/TiO2 catalysts."

[2] "Accordingly, Re is supposed to have some effect on these adsorbed CO, which accelerates the WGS reaction, especially in the case of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts."

[3] "WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction."

[4] "The role of Re would be the stabilization of formate species and accelerate the rate of H2 formation."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of water gas shift reactions in several ways:

1. Formation of bimetallic clusters: Pt-Re and Pd-Re bimetallic clusters form on TiO2 supports, which affects catalyst activity.

2. CO adsorption: Re addition changes CO adsorption characteristics, which can accelerate the WGS reaction, especially for PdRe/TiO2 catalysts.

3. Reaction mechanism: For Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, the WGS reaction proceeds through a surface-formate anion intermediate. The formation of this formate species is the rate-determining step.

4. Hydrogen production: Re stabilizes the formate species and accelerates the rate of H2 formation.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights by:

1. Investigating the atomic-scale structure of bimetallic clusters on model surfaces.
2. Examining CO adsorption characteristics on well-defined Pt-Re and Pd-Re surfaces.
3. Studying the formation and stability of formate intermediates under controlled conditions.
4. Correlating surface structure with reactivity for different bimetallic compositions.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may include challenges in creating well-defined bimetallic surfaces and replicating the complex support interactions found in real catalysts. Bridging the gap between UHV studies and reactor studies remains an important area for future research.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的催化剂，通过以下几种方式影响水煤气变换反应的机理和效率：

1. 形成双金属簇：在TiO2载体上形成Pt-Re和Pd-Re双金属簇，这影响了催化剂的活性。

2. CO吸附：添加Re改变了CO的吸附特性，这可以加速水煤气变换反应，尤其是对PdRe/TiO2催化剂。

3. 反应机理：对于添加Re的Pt和Pd催化剂，水煤气变换反应通过表面甲酸根阴离子中间体进行。这种甲酸盐物种的形成是反应的决速步骤。

4. 氢气生成：Re稳定了甲酸盐物种并加速了H2的生成速率。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能通过以下方式提供洞见：

1. 研究模型表面上双金属簇的原子尺度结构。
2. 检查在明确定义的Pt-Re和Pd-Re表面上CO的吸附特性。
3. 在受控条件下研究甲酸盐中间体的形成和稳定性。
4. 将表面结构与不同双金属组成的反应活性相关联。

然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究中存在一些限制，可能包括创建明确定义的双金属表面的挑战，以及复制真实催化剂中复杂的载体相互作用。弥合UHV研究和反应器研究之间的差距仍然是未来研究的一个重要领域。
