[1] "The key for the improvement of the CO oxidation rate is to allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2. New catalyst formulations are being developed towards supplying these catalysts with an additional site for oxygen adsorption, which will enhance the reaction rate, by addition of a promoter"

[2] "An example of this development is the addition of Fe as a promoter for Pt catalysts. The Pt serves as the site for CO adsorption, whereas the Fe oxide promoter dissociates the O2 molecule, resulting in a non-competitive, dual-site mechanism."

[3] "MnOx is reported as high oxygen storage capacity compound. MnOx has been studied in oxidation reactions and as support for Au catalyst in the PROX reaction. MnOx-doped Pt catalysts have been studied for automotive pollution control and for CO oxidation (in H2-free streams). However, a MnOx-doped Pt catalyst has not been reported as catalyst for the PROX reaction."

[4] "Comparing the PROX behavior of all catalysts in Fig. 5(a), we can see that those with a higher content in MnOx (P1M8ASI and P1M15ASI) are more active than Pt/Al2O3, with the following order of activity: P1M15ASI > P1M8ASI > P1A > P1M2ASI > M2P1ASI ≈ P1M2ACI ≈ M2A. The relative position of the curves can be related, in this case, as the experimental conditions are more oxygen-demanding than those in the absence of H2, to the total amount of Pt (Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism) and Pt–MnOx interface (dual-site mechanism, Mars-van Krevelen type, which is involved in the atomic oxygen supply to the reaction)."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation through a non-competitive dual-site mechanism. This mechanism allows for separate sites for CO and O2 adsorption, enhancing the overall reaction rate. 

For CO oxidation, the addition of promoters like Fe or MnOx to Pt catalysts creates this dual-site mechanism. Pt serves as the site for CO adsorption, while the promoter (Fe oxide or MnOx) dissociates O2 molecules. This arrangement overcomes the competitive adsorption issue present in monometallic Pt catalysts.

In the case of MnOx-doped Pt catalysts, higher MnOx content leads to improved activity for CO oxidation in H2-rich streams (PROX reaction). The activity enhancement is attributed to both the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism on Pt sites and a Mars-van Krevelen type mechanism at the Pt-MnOx interface, which supplies atomic oxygen for the reaction.

Regarding water-gas shift and methane conversion reactions, the provided literature does not contain specific information about the influence of bimetallic catalysts on these reactions.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by allowing detailed investigation of the adsorption and reaction processes on well-defined model surfaces. This could help elucidate the exact nature of the active sites at the metal-promoter interface, the role of different oxidation states of the promoter, and the influence of support materials. Such studies could bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially leading to more rational design of practical catalysts.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, such as difficulties in creating stable bimetallic surfaces and maintaining realistic reaction conditions, need to be addressed to fully correlate these findings with supported catalysts used in reactor studies.

双金属催化剂，尤其是基于Pt的催化剂，通过非竞争性双位点机制显著影响CO氧化的机理和效率。这种机制为CO和O2吸附提供了独立的位点，从而提高了整体反应速率。

对于CO氧化，向Pt催化剂中添加Fe或MnOx等助剂可以创造这种双位点机制。Pt作为CO吸附的位点，而助剂（Fe氧化物或MnOx）负责解离O2分子。这种排列克服了单金属Pt催化剂中存在的竞争性吸附问题。

在MnOx掺杂的Pt催化剂中，较高的MnOx含量可以提高富H2流中CO氧化（PROX反应）的活性。活性的提高归因于Pt位点上的Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制和Pt-MnOx界面上的Mars-van Krevelen型机制，后者为反应提供原子氧。

关于水煤气变换和甲烷转化反应，所提供的文献中没有关于双金属催化剂对这些反应影响的具体信息。

未来的UHV研究可以通过允许在定义明确的模型表面上详细研究吸附和反应过程，提供宝贵的见解。这可以帮助阐明金属-助剂界面处活性位点的确切性质，助剂不同氧化态的作用，以及支撑材料的影响。这些研究可以弥合模型表面和支撑催化剂之间的差距，潜在地导致更合理的实用催化剂设计。

然而，目前Pt基双金属表面UHV研究的限制，如创建稳定双金属表面和维持真实反应条件的困难，需要解决，以便完全将这些发现与反应器研究中使用的支撑催化剂相关联。
