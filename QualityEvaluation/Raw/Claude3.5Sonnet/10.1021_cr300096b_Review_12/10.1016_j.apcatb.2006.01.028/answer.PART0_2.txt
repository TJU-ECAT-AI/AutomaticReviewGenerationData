[1] "The key for the improvement of the CO oxidation rate is to allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2. New catalyst formulations are being developed towards supplying these catalysts with an additional site for oxygen adsorption, which will enhance the reaction rate, by addition of a promoter"

[2] "An example of this development is the addition of Fe as a promoter for Pt catalysts. The Pt serves as the site for CO adsorption, whereas the Fe oxide promoter dissociates the O2 molecule, resulting in a non-competitive, dual-site mechanism."

[3] "MnOx-doped Pt catalysts have been studied for automotive pollution control and for CO oxidation (in H2-free streams). However, a MnOx-doped Pt catalyst has not been reported as catalyst for the PROX reaction."

[4] "While the WGS reaction is beneficial in its forward direction, methanation reactions are always detrimental and should be avoided."

[5] "With the aim to clear such a possibility, we have carried out two sets of experiments. In the first set, a mixture of 1 vol.% CO and 5 vol.% H2O, balanced with He, was fed to the reactor with to a total flow rate of 200 cm3 min1 (GHSV = 12,000 h1), and we have seen that the forward WGS began at temperatures higher than 230 C. In the second set, a feed mixture of 1 vol.% CO2 and 60 vol.% H2, balanced with He, was used with the same GHSV. The results have shown that no formation of CO (by reverse WGS) was observed below 240 C, and only very low amounts below 300 C."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies by introducing a non-competitive dual-site mechanism. This allows for separate adsorption sites for CO and O2, enhancing the reaction rate. For example, adding Fe as a promoter to Pt catalysts creates a system where Pt adsorbs CO while Fe oxide dissociates O2.

For the water gas shift (WGS) reaction, bimetallic catalysts can potentially improve the forward reaction, which is considered beneficial. However, the literature does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the WGS reaction mechanism or efficiency.

Regarding methane conversions, the literature mentions that methanation reactions should be avoided as they are detrimental, but it doesn't provide details on how bimetallic catalysts specifically influence these reactions.

The document does not directly address potential insights from future UHV studies or correlations with model surfaces and supported catalysts. However, based on the information provided, UHV studies could potentially help elucidate the atomic-scale interactions between Pt and promoter metals (like Fe or Mn) on model surfaces. This could provide insights into the formation and nature of the dual-site mechanism observed in reactor studies.

Current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not explicitly mentioned in the given literature. However, the lack of information on UHV studies in this context suggests that there may be challenges in accurately replicating the complex environments of practical catalysts in UHV conditions.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，通过引入非竞争性双位点机制影响CO氧化的机理和效率。这允许CO和O2有单独的吸附位点，从而提高反应速率。例如，在Pt催化剂中添加Fe作为促进剂，创造了一个Pt吸附CO而Fe氧化物分解O2的系统。

对于水煤气变换（WGS）反应，双金属催化剂可能会改善正向反应，这被认为是有益的。然而，文献并未提供关于基于Pt的双金属催化剂如何影响WGS反应机理或效率的具体信息。

关于甲烷转化，文献提到应避免甲烷化反应，因为它们是有害的，但没有提供双金属催化剂如何具体影响这些反应的详细信息。

文档没有直接讨论未来UHV研究的潜在见解或与模型表面和负载催化剂的相关性。然而，基于所提供的信息，UHV研究可能有助于阐明Pt与促进金属（如Fe或Mn）在模型表面上的原子尺度相互作用。这可能为反应器研究中观察到的双位点机制的形成和性质提供见解。

文献中没有明确提到当前UHV研究在基于Pt的双金属表面上的局限性。然而，在这方面缺乏UHV研究的信息表明，在UHV条件下准确复制实际催化剂的复杂环境可能存在挑战。
