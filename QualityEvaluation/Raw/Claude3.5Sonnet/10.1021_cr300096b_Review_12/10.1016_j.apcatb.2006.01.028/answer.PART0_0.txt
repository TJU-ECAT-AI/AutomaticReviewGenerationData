[1] "The key for the improvement of the CO oxidation rate is to allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2. New catalyst formulations are being developed towards supplying these catalysts with an additional site for oxygen adsorption, which will enhance the reaction rate, by addition of a promoter"

[2] "An example of this development is the addition of Fe as a promoter for Pt catalysts. The Pt serves as the site for CO adsorption, whereas the Fe oxide promoter dissociates the O2 molecule, resulting in a non-competitive, dual-site mechanism."

[3] "MnOx is reported as high oxygen storage capacity compound. MnOx has been studied in oxidation reactions and as support for Au catalyst in the PROX reaction. MnOx-doped Pt catalysts have been studied for automotive pollution control and for CO oxidation (in H2-free streams)."

[4] "Comparing the PROX behavior of all catalysts in Fig. 5 (a), we can see that those with a higher content in MnOx (P1M8ASI and P1M15ASI) are more active than Pt/Al2O3, with the following order of activity: P1M15ASI > P1M8ASI > P1A > P1M2ASI > M2P1ASI ≈ P1M2ACI ≈ M2A."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in several ways:

1. They allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2 adsorption, which improves the CO oxidation rate. The second metal acts as a promoter, providing an additional site for oxygen adsorption.

2. In Pt-Fe bimetallic catalysts, Pt serves as the site for CO adsorption, while Fe oxide dissociates the O2 molecule. This results in a non-competitive, dual-site mechanism that enhances catalytic activity.

3. MnOx-doped Pt catalysts have shown promise in CO oxidation reactions due to MnOx's high oxygen storage capacity. These catalysts have been studied for automotive pollution control and CO oxidation in H2-free streams.

4. In PROX reactions, catalysts with higher MnOx content (e.g., P1M8ASI and P1M15ASI) showed higher activity than Pt/Al2O3 alone, demonstrating the beneficial effect of the bimetallic composition.

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of bimetallic catalysts on water gas shift reaction and methane conversions, nor does it discuss potential insights from future UHV studies. To better understand the correlation between reactor studies and model surfaces, future UHV studies could focus on investigating the atomic-scale interactions between Pt and promoter metals (such as Fe or Mn) on well-defined surfaces. This could provide valuable insights into the nature of active sites, surface intermediates, and reaction mechanisms that contribute to the enhanced performance observed in reactor studies.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的催化剂，通过以下几种方式影响CO氧化机理和效率：

1. 它们允许CO和O2吸附采用非竞争性双位点机制，从而提高CO氧化速率。第二种金属作为助催化剂，提供额外的氧气吸附位点。

2. 在Pt-Fe双金属催化剂中，Pt作为CO吸附位点，而Fe氧化物解离O2分子。这导致非竞争性双位点机制，提高了催化活性。

3. MnOx掺杂的Pt催化剂在CO氧化反应中表现出良好的前景，这是由于MnOx具有高氧储存容量。这些催化剂已被研究用于汽车污染控制和无氢环境下的CO氧化。

4. 在PROX反应中，具有较高MnOx含量的催化剂（例如P1M8ASI和P1M15ASI）表现出比单独的Pt/Al2O3更高的活性，证明了双金属组成的有益效果。

文献中没有提供关于双金属催化剂对水气变换反应和甲烷转化的影响的具体信息，也没有讨论未来UHV研究可能提供的潜在见解。为了更好地理解反应器研究和模型表面之间的关联，未来的UHV研究可以集中在研究良好定义表面上铂和助催化金属（如Fe或Mn）之间的原子尺度相互作用。这可以为反应器研究中观察到的性能增强提供有价值的见解，包括活性位点的性质、表面中间体和反应机理。
