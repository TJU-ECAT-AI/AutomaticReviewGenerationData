[1] "The key for the improvement of the CO oxidation rate is to allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2. New catalyst formulations are being developed towards supplying these catalysts with an additional site for oxygen adsorption, which will enhance the reaction rate, by addition of a promoter"

[2] "An example of this development is the addition of Fe as a promoter for Pt catalysts. The Pt serves as the site for CO adsorption, whereas the Fe oxide promoter dissociates the O2 molecule, resulting in a non-competitive, dual-site mechanism."

[3] "MnOx is reported as high oxygen storage capacity compound. MnOx has been studied in oxidation reactions and as support for Au catalyst in the PROX reaction. MnOx-doped Pt catalysts have been studied for automotive pollution control and for CO oxidation (in H2-free streams)."

[4] "Comparing the PROX behavior of all catalysts in Fig. 5(a), we can see that those with a higher content in MnOx (P1M8ASI and P1M15ASI) are more active than Pt/Al2O3, with the following order of activity: P1M15ASI > P1M8ASI > P1A > P1M2ASI > M2P1ASI ≈ P1M2ACI ≈ M2A."

[5] "The results of TPR indicated that reduction of MnOx is favored by the presence of Pt, which not only occurs at lower temperatures, but also to a higher extent. This effect increases with the Mn content of the catalysts, what points to a better contact between Pt and Mn in terms of a common interface."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation through several mechanisms:

1. They allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2 adsorption, which enhances the reaction rate. The addition of a promoter (such as Fe or Mn) to Pt catalysts provides an additional site for oxygen adsorption.

2. In Pt-Fe catalysts, Pt serves as the site for CO adsorption, while Fe oxide dissociates the O2 molecule, resulting in a non-competitive, dual-site mechanism.

3. MnOx, when added to Pt catalysts, acts as a high oxygen storage capacity compound, improving oxidation reactions. MnOx-doped Pt catalysts have shown enhanced performance in CO oxidation.

4. The activity of Pt-MnOx catalysts increases with higher MnOx content, with the order of activity being P1M15ASI > P1M8ASI > P1A > P1M2ASI > M2P1ASI ≈ P1M2ACI ≈ M2A.

5. The presence of Pt favors the reduction of MnOx, occurring at lower temperatures and to a higher extent. This effect increases with Mn content, indicating better contact between Pt and Mn at the interface.

Future UHV studies could provide insights into the atomic-level interactions between Pt and the promoter (e.g., Fe or Mn) at the interface, helping to correlate the findings from reactor studies with model surfaces. They could also elucidate the specific roles of each metal in the adsorption and activation of reactants, and how these processes change with different metal ratios or surface structures. Additionally, UHV studies could help identify the nature and distribution of active sites on the bimetallic surfaces, which could inform the design of more efficient supported catalysts.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, such as difficulties in creating well-defined bimetallic surfaces and maintaining them under reaction conditions, need to be addressed to fully bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts used in reactor studies.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的催化剂，通过几种机制显著影响CO氧化的机理和效率：

1. 它们允许CO和O2吸附采用非竞争性双位点机制，从而提高反应速率。向铂催化剂中添加助催化剂（如Fe或Mn）为氧气吸附提供了额外的位点。

2. 在Pt-Fe催化剂中，Pt作为CO吸附的位点，而Fe氧化物解离O2分子，形成非竞争性的双位点机制。

3. 当MnOx添加到Pt催化剂中时，它作为高氧存储容量化合物，改善氧化反应。MnOx掺杂的Pt催化剂在CO氧化中表现出增强的性能。

4. Pt-MnOx催化剂的活性随MnOx含量的增加而增加，活性顺序为P1M15ASI > P1M8ASI > P1A > P1M2ASI > M2P1ASI ≈ P1M2ACI ≈ M2A。

5. Pt的存在有利于MnOx的还原，在更低的温度下发生并且程度更高。这种效应随Mn含量的增加而增加，表明Pt和Mn在界面处的接触更好。

未来的UHV研究可以提供关于Pt和助催化剂（如Fe或Mn）在界面处原子级相互作用的洞察，有助于将反应器研究的发现与模型表面相关联。它们还可以阐明每种金属在反应物吸附和活化中的具体作用，以及这些过程如何随不同的金属比例或表面结构而变化。此外，UHV研究可以帮助确定双金属表面上活性位点的性质和分布，这可以为设计更高效的负载型催化剂提供信息。

然而，当前在基于Pt的双金属表面UHV研究中的限制，如创建明确定义的双金属表面和在反应条件下维持它们的困难，需要得到解决，以充分弥合模型表面和反应器研究中使用的负载型催化剂之间的差距。
