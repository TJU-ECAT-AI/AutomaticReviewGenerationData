[1] "Theoretically, the amount of oxygen necessary for complete CO oxidation is half the molar amount of CO in the feedstream, according to Eq. (1). However, an excess of oxygen is needed due to the simultaneous oxidation of H2."

[2] "A traditional catalyst for the PROX reaction consists of a noble metal (Pt, Pd, Ru) supported on alumina [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Oxidation of CO on these catalysts is a multi-step process obeying a single-site competitive LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism, where CO, H2 and O2 compete for the noble metal surface."

[3] "The key for the improvement of the CO oxidation rate is to allow for a non-competitive dual-site mechanism for CO and O2. New catalyst formulations are being developed towards supplying these catalysts with an additional site for oxygen adsorption, which will enhance the reaction rate, by addition of a promoter [16], [17]."

[4] "An example of this development is the addition of Fe as a promoter for Pt catalysts [18], [19], [20], [21]. The Pt serves as the site for CO adsorption, whereas the Fe oxide promoter dissociates the O2 molecule, resulting in a non-competitive, dual-site mechanism."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in several ways:

1. They introduce a dual-site mechanism, where one metal (e.g. Pt) serves as the site for CO adsorption, while the promoter metal oxide (e.g. Fe oxide) dissociates O2. This non-competitive mechanism enhances reaction rates compared to single-site catalysts.

2. They allow for improved oxygen activation and supply, which is crucial since excess oxygen is needed due to simultaneous H2 oxidation in PROX reactions.

3. They can overcome limitations of traditional noble metal catalysts on alumina, which follow a competitive Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism where CO, H2, and O2 compete for surface sites.

Future UHV studies could provide insights by:

1. Allowing detailed surface characterization of model Pt-based bimetallic surfaces to understand the nature of active sites and metal-promoter interactions.

2. Enabling in-situ observation of reaction intermediates and mechanisms on well-defined surfaces.

3. Correlating activity and selectivity with surface composition and structure in controlled environments.

4. Bridging the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts by systematically increasing complexity.

However, current UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are limited in their ability to fully replicate realistic reaction conditions, especially regarding pressure and gas-phase compositions. Overcoming these limitations could provide valuable insights into structure-activity relationships and reaction mechanisms.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的催化剂，通过以下几种方式影响CO氧化机理和效率：

1. 它们引入了双位点机制，其中一种金属（如Pt）作为CO吸附位点，而促进剂金属氧化物（如Fe氧化物）解离O2。这种非竞争性机制提高了反应速率，相比单位点催化剂。

2. 它们允许改进氧气的活化和供应，这对PROX反应中由于同时发生H2氧化而需要过量氧气至关重要。

3. 它们可以克服传统的负载在氧化铝上的贵金属催化剂的局限性，后者遵循竞争性的Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制，其中CO、H2和O2竞争表面位点。

未来的UHV研究可以通过以下方式提供洞见：

1. 允许对模型Pt基双金属表面进行详细表征，以了解活性位点的性质和金属-促进剂相互作用。

2. 能够在定义明确的表面上原位观察反应中间体和机理。

3. 在受控环境中将活性和选择性与表面组成和结构相关联。

4. 通过系统地增加复杂性，弥合模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距。

然而，目前对Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究在完全复制真实反应条件方面存在局限性，特别是在压力和气相成分方面。克服这些限制可以为结构-活性关系和反应机理提供宝贵的见解。
