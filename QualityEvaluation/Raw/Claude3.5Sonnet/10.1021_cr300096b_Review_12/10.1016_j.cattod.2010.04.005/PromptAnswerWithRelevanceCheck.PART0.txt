[1] "Among them AuPt/CeO2 catalyst shows the highest activity with 78% conversion of CO at 250 C."

[2] "The activity increases obviously with Pt loadings in AuPt/CeO2. For example, CO conversion is only 8.9% at 200 C for Au/CeO2 catalyst. When the Pt loading reaches 0.5%, 1%, and 2%, CO conversion improves to 37.6%, 46.5% and 54.1%, respectively."

[3] "For bimetallic AuPt/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles emerges at 145 C and the low-temperature reduction peak of ceria is shifted to at Tmax = 390 C. These results indicated that the coexistence of both Au and Pt is beneficial to the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles and the reduction of surface ceria."

[4] "Besides, the concentration of the surface oxygen of ceria obviously increases in the presence of Pt. It causes the formation of oxygen vacancies, located mainly on the catalyst surface. This is why the bimetallic Au and Pt catalysts possess the higher WGS reaction activity than monometallic Au/CeO2 or Pt/CeO2 catalyst."

[5] "The addition of Pt is conducive to the formation of Auδ+ because of the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band, accompanied by intraatomic charge redistributions. The presence of both metallic and ionic gold species, the high concentration of surface oxygen as well as the low degree of Ce3+ surface defects determine simultaneously the WGS reaction activity of the bimetallic AuPt catalyst."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation and water gas shift reactions in several ways:

1. Enhanced activity: AuPt/CeO2 catalysts show higher activity for water gas shift reactions compared to other bimetallic systems, with CO conversion increasing as Pt loading increases.

2. Improved reducibility: The coexistence of Au and Pt facilitates the reduction of oxygen species on fine gold particles and surface ceria at lower temperatures.

3. Oxygen vacancy formation: Pt increases the concentration of surface oxygen on ceria, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies mainly on the catalyst surface. This contributes to higher water gas shift reaction activity in bimetallic Au-Pt catalysts compared to monometallic Au or Pt catalysts.

4. Electronic interactions: Interatomic charge transfer occurs from Au 5d to Pt 5d band, promoting the formation of ionic gold species (Auδ+). This electronic interaction, along with the presence of both metallic and ionic gold species, high surface oxygen concentration, and low Ce3+ surface defects, determines the catalytic activity.

5. Structural effects: The addition of Au and Pt affects the structure of CeO2, creating oxygen vacancies and Ce3+ ions, while also reducing the size of CeO2 particles.

The literature does not provide information on methane conversions or UHV studies. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into:

1. The nature of active sites on model surfaces vs. supported catalysts
2. The role of metal-support interactions in catalytic activity
3. The impact of particle size and morphology on reactivity
4. The mechanisms of charge transfer and electronic interactions between Au and Pt atoms

These studies could help bridge the gap between reactor studies and fundamental surface science, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the catalytic processes involved.

双金属催化剂，尤其是基于Pt的催化剂，通过以下几种方式显著影响CO氧化和水煤气变换反应的机理和效率：

1. 增强活性：AuPt/CeO2催化剂比其他双金属系统表现出更高的水煤气变换反应活性，随着Pt负载量的增加，CO转化率也随之提高。

2. 改善还原性：Au和Pt的共存有利于在较低温度下还原金纳米粒子和表面氧化铈上的氧物种。

3. 氧空位形成：Pt增加了氧化铈表面氧的浓度，导致主要在催化剂表面形成氧空位。这使得双金属Au-Pt催化剂的水煤气变换反应活性高于单金属Au或Pt催化剂。

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones like AuPt/CeO2, significantly enhance the efficiency of the water gas shift (WGS) reaction compared to monometallic catalysts. The AuPt/CeO2 catalyst shows the highest activity among various bimetallic catalysts tested, achieving 78% CO conversion at 250°C. 

The improved performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts can be attributed to several factors:

1. Enhanced reduction of oxygen species: The presence of both Au and Pt facilitates the reduction of oxygen species on fine gold particles and surface ceria at lower temperatures.

2. Increased oxygen vacancies: Pt addition increases the concentration of surface oxygen on ceria, leading to more oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface.

3. Synergistic effects: The coexistence of Au and Pt promotes the reduction of both gold particles and surface ceria, which is beneficial for the WGS reaction.

These findings from reactor studies provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of bimetallic catalysts. However, the literature does not discuss UHV studies or their potential insights. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts by investigating the surface structure, electronic properties, and adsorption behavior of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces under controlled conditions. This could help bridge the gap between reactor studies and fundamental surface science, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the catalytic processes at the atomic level.

基于Pt的双金属催化剂性能提升可归因于以下几个因素：

1. 增强氧物种的还原：Au和Pt的共同存在有利于在较低温度下还原细小金颗粒和表面氧化铈上的氧物种。

2. 增加氧空位：Pt的添加增加了氧化铈表面氧的浓度，导致催化剂表面产生更多的氧空位。

3. 协同效应：Au和Pt的共存促进了金颗粒和表面氧化铈的还原，这对WGS反应有利。

这些来自反应器研究的发现为双金属催化剂的机理提供了宝贵的见解。然而，文献中并未讨论超高真空（UHV）研究或其潜在的见解。未来的UHV研究可能通过在受控条件下研究基于Pt的双金属表面的表面结构、电子性质和吸附行为，将这些发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联。这可能有助于弥合反应器研究与基础表面科学之间的差距，提供对原子水平上催化过程更全面的理解。

[2] "It is very clear that the addition of such as platinum or nickel components brings a positive effect on gold catalysts for WGS reaction."

[3] "Moreover, the introduction of Au and M to ceria makes the size of ceria smaller. According to Scherrer's equation, the average size of ceria particles is 132.4 nm for pure CeO2; 103.5 nm for AuCu/CeO2; 102.3 nm for AuNi/CeO2; 101.1 nm for AuAg/CeO2; 109.1 nm for AuPd/CeO2; and 96.9 nm for AuPt/CeO2."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of the water gas shift (WGS) reaction in several ways:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity: The addition of platinum to gold catalysts supported on ceria (AuPt/CeO2) shows the highest activity among the bimetallic catalysts studied for the WGS reaction. This indicates that platinum has a strong positive effect on the catalytic performance.

2. Particle size reduction: The introduction of Au and Pt to ceria reduces the size of ceria particles. Smaller particle sizes generally lead to increased surface area and potentially more active sites for catalysis.

3. Improved reducibility: The coexistence of Au and Pt facilitates the reduction of oxygen species on fine gold particles and the reduction of surface ceria. This enhanced reducibility likely contributes to the higher catalytic activity.

4. Oxygen vacancy formation: The presence of Pt increases the concentration of surface oxygen on ceria and promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies. These vacancies are crucial for the WGS reaction mechanism and contribute to the higher activity of bimetallic Au-Pt catalysts compared to monometallic versions.

5. Synergistic effects: The combination of Au and Pt creates synergistic effects that are not present in the individual metals, leading to superior catalytic performance.

While the current study focuses on reactor studies, future UHV (ultra-high vacuum) studies could provide valuable insights by:

1. Investigating the atomic-scale structure and interactions between Au, Pt, and ceria surfaces.
2. Studying the adsorption and reaction mechanisms of CO and H2O on model AuPt/CeO2 surfaces.
3. Examining the formation and role of oxygen vacancies under controlled conditions.
4. Correlating the electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces with their catalytic activity.

However, it's important to note that UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may face limitations in replicating the exact conditions of practical catalysts, particularly in terms of pressure and the presence of water vapor. Bridging the gap between UHV studies and realistic catalytic conditions remains a challenge in this field.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的催化剂，通过以下几种方式显著影响水气变换（WGS）反应的机理和效率：

1. 提高催化活性：在氧化铈（CeO2）支撑的金催化剂中添加铂（AuPt/CeO2）显示出研究的双金属催化剂中最高的WGS反应活性。这表明铂对催化性能有很强的正面影响。

2. 粒子尺寸减小：将Au和Pt引入氧化铈会减小氧化铈颗粒的尺寸。较小的粒子尺寸通常会导致表面积增加，可能会产生更多的催化活性位点。

3. 提高还原性：Au和Pt的共存促进了细小金颗粒上氧物种的还原和表面氧化铈的还原。这种增强的还原性可能有助于提高催化活性。

4. 氧空位形成：Pt的存在增加了氧化铈表面氧的浓度，并促进了氧空位的形成。这些空位对WGS反应机理至关重要，并有助于双金属Au-Pt催化剂比单金属版本具有更高的活性。

5. 协同效应：Au和Pt的组合创造了单个金属中不存在的协同效应，从而导致更优越的催化性能。

虽然当前的研究集中在反应器研究上，但未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会提供宝贵的见解，通过：

1. 研究Au、Pt和氧化铈表面之间的原子尺度结构和相互作用。
2. 研究CO和H2O在模型AuPt/CeO2表面上的吸附和反应机理。
3. 在受控条件下检查氧空位的形成和作用。
4. 将双金属表面的电子性质与其催化活性相关联。

然而，需要注意的是，基于Pt的双金属表面的UHV研究在复制实际催化剂的确切条件方面可能面临限制，特别是在压力和水蒸气存在方面。在这一领域中，弥合UHV研究与实际催化条件之间的差距仍然是一个挑战。

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence CO oxidation and water gas shift reaction mechanisms and efficiencies. The AuPt/CeO2 catalyst demonstrates the highest activity for CO conversion. The introduction of platinum leads to the formation of partly oxidized gold species through interatomic charge transfer. This bimetallic combination enhances the reduction of ceria to Ce3+ and creates oxygen vacancies while decreasing the average size of ceria particles.

The presence of both Au and Pt facilitates the reduction of oxygen species on fine gold particles and surface ceria at lower temperatures compared to monometallic catalysts. The concentration of surface oxygen on ceria increases with the addition of Pt, promoting the formation of oxygen vacancies mainly on the catalyst surface. These factors contribute to the higher water gas shift reaction activity of bimetallic Au-Pt catalysts compared to their monometallic counterparts.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by allowing for more precise control and analysis of surface interactions between Pt, Au, and the support material. This could help elucidate the exact nature of the charge transfer between Au and Pt, the formation mechanism of oxygen vacancies, and the role of metal-support interactions in catalytic activity. Such studies could also investigate the influence of particle size and dispersion on catalyst performance, which is challenging to control in reactor studies.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces include difficulties in accurately replicating the complex environment of a working catalyst, particularly the presence of water vapor and high pressures in water gas shift reactions. Additionally, UHV studies may not fully capture the dynamic nature of catalyst surfaces under reaction conditions. Despite these limitations, correlating UHV findings with reactor studies and supported catalysts could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the fundamental mechanisms driving the enhanced performance of bimetallic catalysts.

双金属催化剂，尤其是基于Pt的催化剂，显著影响了CO氧化和水气变换反应的机理和效率。AuPt/CeO2催化剂展示了最高的CO转化活性。引入铂导致了部分氧化的金物种的形成，这是通过原子间电荷转移实现的。这种双金属组合增强了氧化铈还原为Ce3+的能力，创造了氧空位，同时减小了氧化铈颗粒的平均尺寸。

Au和Pt的共同存在促进了细小金颗粒上氧物种和表面氧化铈的还原，相比单金属催化剂，这种还原发生在更低的温度。随着Pt的添加，氧化铈表面的氧浓度增加，促进了主要位于催化剂表面的氧空位的形成。这些因素共同导致了双金属Au-Pt催化剂比单金属催化剂具有更高的水气变换反应活性。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供宝贵的见解，因为它允许更精确地控制和分析Pt、Au与支撑材料之间的表面相互作用。这可能有助于阐明Au和Pt之间电荷转移的确切本质、氧空位的形成机制以及金属-支撑物相互作用在催化活性中的作用。这些研究还可以调查粒子尺寸和分散度对催化剂性能的影响，这在反应器研究中难以控制。

然而，当前基于Pt的双金属表面的UHV研究存在一些限制，包括难以准确复制工作催化剂的复杂环境，特别是水气变换反应中水蒸气的存在和高压条件。此外，UHV研究可能无法完全捕捉反应条件下催化剂表面的动态性质。尽管存在这些限制，将UHV研究结果与反应器研究和负载型催化剂相关联，可能为理解驱动双金属催化剂增强性能的基本机制提供更全面的认识。
