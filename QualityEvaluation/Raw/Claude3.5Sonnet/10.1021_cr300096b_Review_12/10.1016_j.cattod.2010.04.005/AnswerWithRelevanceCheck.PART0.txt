          "Among them AuPt/CeO2 catalyst shows the highest activity with 78% conversion of CO at 250 C."

"The activity increases obviously with Pt loadings in AuPt/CeO2. For example, CO conversion is only 8.9% at 200 C for Au/CeO2 catalyst. When the Pt loading reaches 0.5%, 1%, and 2%, CO conversion improves to 37.6%, 46.5% and 54.1%, respectively."

"For bimetallic AuPt/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles emerges at 145 C and the low-temperature reduction peak of ceria is shifted to at Tmax = 390 C. These results indicated that the coexistence of both Au and Pt is beneficial to the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles and the reduction of surface ceria."

"Besides, the concentration of the surface oxygen of ceria obviously increases in the presence of Pt. It causes the formation of oxygen vacancies, located mainly on the catalyst surface. This is why the bimetallic Au and Pt catalysts possess the higher WGS reaction activity than monometallic Au/CeO2 or Pt/CeO2 catalyst."

"The addition of Pt is conducive to the formation of Auδ+ because of the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band, accompanied by intraatomic charge redistributions. The presence of both metallic and ionic gold species, the high concentration of surface oxygen as well as the low degree of Ce3+ surface defects determine simultaneously the WGS reaction activity of the bimetallic AuPt catalyst."

"It is found that the introduction of platinum in AuPt/CeO2 catalyst is responsible for the formation of partly oxidized gold species probably due to the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band."

"The presence of both gold and platinum is beneficial to the reduction of ceria to Ce3+ species as well as the creation of oxygen vacancies and makes the average size of ceria smaller."

          Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones like AuPt/CeO2, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation and water gas shift (WGS) reactions in several ways:

1. Enhanced activity: AuPt/CeO2 catalysts show higher activity for both CO oxidation and WGS reactions compared to monometallic catalysts. The activity increases with Pt loading, with AuPt/CeO2 showing the highest CO conversion (78% at 250°C) among tested catalysts.

2. Improved reducibility: The coexistence of Au and Pt facilitates the reduction of oxygen species on fine gold particles and surface ceria at lower temperatures. This enhanced reducibility likely contributes to higher catalytic activity.

3. Oxygen vacancy formation: Pt addition increases the concentration of surface oxygen on ceria and promotes oxygen vacancy formation, mainly on the catalyst surface. These vacancies are crucial for the WGS reaction mechanism and contribute to higher activity in bimetallic Au-Pt catalysts.

4. Electronic interactions: Interatomic charge transfer occurs from Au 5d to Pt 5d band, promoting the formation of partly oxidized gold species (Auδ+). This electronic interaction, along with the presence of both metallic and ionic gold species, high surface oxygen concentration, and low Ce3+ surface defects, determines the catalytic activity.

5. Structural effects: The addition of Au and Pt affects the structure of CeO2, creating oxygen vacancies and Ce3+ ions, while also reducing the size of CeO2 particles.

The literature does not provide information on methane conversions or UHV studies. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into:

1. The nature of active sites on model surfaces vs. supported catalysts
2. The role of metal-support interactions in catalytic activity
3. The impact of particle size and morphology on reactivity
4. The mechanisms of charge transfer and electronic interactions between Au and Pt atoms

These studies could help bridge the gap between reactor studies and fundamental surface science, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the catalytic processes involved. However, limitations in replicating realistic catalytic conditions (e.g., pressure, presence of water vapor) in UHV environments should be considered when correlating findings with supported catalysts and reactor studies.

          双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂（如AuPt/CeO2），通过以下几种方式显著影响CO氧化和水气变换（WGS）反应的机理和效率：

1. 提高活性：与单金属催化剂相比，AuPt/CeO2催化剂在CO氧化和WGS反应中表现出更高的活性。活性随Pt负载量的增加而提高，AuPt/CeO2在测试的催化剂中显示出最高的CO转化率（250°C时为78%）。

2. 改善还原性：Au和Pt的共存有利于在较低温度下还原金纳米粒子和表面氧化铈上的氧物种。这种增强的还原性可能有助于提高催化活性。

3. 氧空位形成：Pt的添加增加了氧化铈表面氧的浓度，并主要在催化剂表面促进了氧空位的形成。这些空位对WGS反应机理至关重要，并导致双金属Au-Pt催化剂具有更高的活性。

4. 电子相互作用：Au 5d到Pt 5d能带之间发生原子间电荷转移，促进了部分氧化金物种（Auδ+）的形成。这种电子相互作用，加上金属态和离子态金物种的共存、高表面氧浓度以及低Ce3+表面缺陷，共同决定了催化活性。

5. 结构效应：Au和Pt的添加影响了CeO2的结构，创造了氧空位和Ce3+离子，同时也减小了CeO2粒子的尺寸。

文献中没有提供关于甲烷转化或超高真空（UHV）研究的信息。未来的UHV研究可能会提供以下见解：

1. 模型表面与负载催化剂上活性位点的性质
2. 金属-载体相互作用在催化活性中的作用
3. 粒子尺寸和形态对反应性的影响
4. Au和Pt原子之间电荷转移和电子相互作用的机制

这些研究可能有助于弥合反应器研究和基础表面科学之间的差距，从而更全面地理解所涉及的催化过程。然而，在将研究结果与负载型催化剂和反应器研究相关联时，应考虑到在UHV环境中复制真实催化条件（如压力、水蒸气的存在）的局限性。
