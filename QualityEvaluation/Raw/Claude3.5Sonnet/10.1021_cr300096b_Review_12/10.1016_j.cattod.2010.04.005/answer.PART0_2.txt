[1] "Among them AuPt/CeO2 catalyst shows the highest activity with 78% conversion of CO at 250 C."

[2] "The AuPt/CeO2 catalyst displays a higher activity than other catalysts. The WGS reaction activities over these catalysts decrease as the following order: AuPt/CeO2 > AuNi/CeO2 > Au/CeO2 > AuCu/CeO2 > AuAg/CeO2 > AuPd/CeO2."

[3] "For bimetallic AuPt/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles emerges at 145 C and the low-temperature reduction peak of ceria is shifted to at Tmax = 390 C. These results indicated that the coexistence of both Au and Pt is beneficial to the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles and the reduction of surface ceria."

[4] "Besides, the concentration of the surface oxygen of ceria obviously increases in the presence of Pt. It causes the formation of oxygen vacancies, located mainly on the catalyst surface. This is why the bimetallic Au and Pt catalysts possess the higher WGS reaction activity than monometallic Au/CeO2 or Pt/CeO2 catalyst."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones like AuPt/CeO2, significantly enhance the efficiency of the water gas shift (WGS) reaction compared to monometallic catalysts. The AuPt/CeO2 catalyst shows the highest activity among various bimetallic catalysts tested, achieving 78% CO conversion at 250°C. 

The improved performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts can be attributed to several factors:

1. Enhanced reduction of oxygen species: The presence of both Au and Pt facilitates the reduction of oxygen species on fine gold particles and surface ceria at lower temperatures.

2. Increased oxygen vacancies: Pt addition increases the concentration of surface oxygen on ceria, leading to more oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface.

3. Synergistic effects: The coexistence of Au and Pt promotes the reduction of both gold particles and surface ceria, which is beneficial for the WGS reaction.

These findings from reactor studies provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of bimetallic catalysts. However, the literature does not discuss UHV studies or their potential insights. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts by investigating the surface structure, electronic properties, and adsorption behavior of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces under controlled conditions. This could help bridge the gap between reactor studies and fundamental surface science, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the catalytic processes at the atomic level.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂（如AuPt/CeO2），与单金属催化剂相比，显著提高了水气变换（WGS）反应的效率。在测试的各种双金属催化剂中，AuPt/CeO2催化剂表现出最高的活性，在250°C时实现了78%的CO转化率。

基于Pt的双金属催化剂性能提升可归因于以下几个因素：

1. 增强氧物种的还原：Au和Pt的共同存在有利于在较低温度下还原细小金颗粒和表面氧化铈上的氧物种。

2. 增加氧空位：Pt的添加增加了氧化铈表面氧的浓度，导致催化剂表面产生更多的氧空位。

3. 协同效应：Au和Pt的共存促进了金颗粒和表面氧化铈的还原，这对WGS反应有利。

这些来自反应器研究的发现为双金属催化剂的机理提供了宝贵的见解。然而，文献中并未讨论超高真空（UHV）研究或其潜在的见解。未来的UHV研究可能通过在受控条件下研究基于Pt的双金属表面的表面结构、电子性质和吸附行为，将这些发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联。这可能有助于弥合反应器研究与基础表面科学之间的差距，提供对原子水平上催化过程更全面的理解。
