[1] "Among them AuPt/CeO2 catalyst shows the highest activity with 78% conversion of CO at 250 C."

[2] "It is found that the introduction of platinum in AuPt/CeO2 catalyst is responsible for the formation of partly oxidized gold species probably due to the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band."

[3] "The presence of both gold and platinum is beneficial to the reduction of ceria to Ce3+ species as well as the creation of oxygen vacancies and makes the average size of ceria smaller."

[4] "For bimetallic AuPt/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles emerges at 145 C and the low-temperature reduction peak of ceria is shifted to at Tmax = 390 C. These results indicated that the coexistence of both Au and Pt is beneficial to the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles and the reduction of surface ceria."

[5] "Besides, the concentration of the surface oxygen of ceria obviously increases in the presence of Pt. It causes the formation of oxygen vacancies, located mainly on the catalyst surface. This is why the bimetallic Au and Pt catalysts possess the higher WGS reaction activity than monometallic Au/CeO2 or Pt/CeO2 catalyst."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence CO oxidation and water gas shift reaction mechanisms and efficiencies. The AuPt/CeO2 catalyst demonstrates the highest activity for CO conversion. The introduction of platinum leads to the formation of partly oxidized gold species through interatomic charge transfer. This bimetallic combination enhances the reduction of ceria to Ce3+ and creates oxygen vacancies while decreasing the average size of ceria particles.

The presence of both Au and Pt facilitates the reduction of oxygen species on fine gold particles and surface ceria at lower temperatures compared to monometallic catalysts. The concentration of surface oxygen on ceria increases with the addition of Pt, promoting the formation of oxygen vacancies mainly on the catalyst surface. These factors contribute to the higher water gas shift reaction activity of bimetallic Au-Pt catalysts compared to their monometallic counterparts.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by allowing for more precise control and analysis of surface interactions between Pt, Au, and the support material. This could help elucidate the exact nature of the charge transfer between Au and Pt, the formation mechanism of oxygen vacancies, and the role of metal-support interactions in catalytic activity. Such studies could also investigate the influence of particle size and dispersion on catalyst performance, which is challenging to control in reactor studies.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces include difficulties in accurately replicating the complex environment of a working catalyst, particularly the presence of water vapor and high pressures in water gas shift reactions. Additionally, UHV studies may not fully capture the dynamic nature of catalyst surfaces under reaction conditions. Despite these limitations, correlating UHV findings with reactor studies and supported catalysts could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the fundamental mechanisms driving the enhanced performance of bimetallic catalysts.

双金属催化剂，尤其是基于Pt的催化剂，显著影响了CO氧化和水气变换反应的机理和效率。AuPt/CeO2催化剂展示了最高的CO转化活性。引入铂导致了部分氧化的金物种的形成，这是通过原子间电荷转移实现的。这种双金属组合增强了氧化铈还原为Ce3+的能力，创造了氧空位，同时减小了氧化铈颗粒的平均尺寸。

Au和Pt的共同存在促进了细小金颗粒上氧物种和表面氧化铈的还原，相比单金属催化剂，这种还原发生在更低的温度。随着Pt的添加，氧化铈表面的氧浓度增加，促进了主要位于催化剂表面的氧空位的形成。这些因素共同导致了双金属Au-Pt催化剂比单金属催化剂具有更高的水气变换反应活性。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供宝贵的见解，因为它允许更精确地控制和分析Pt、Au与支撑材料之间的表面相互作用。这可能有助于阐明Au和Pt之间电荷转移的确切本质、氧空位的形成机制以及金属-支撑物相互作用在催化活性中的作用。这些研究还可以调查粒子尺寸和分散度对催化剂性能的影响，这在反应器研究中难以控制。

然而，当前基于Pt的双金属表面的UHV研究存在一些限制，包括难以准确复制工作催化剂的复杂环境，特别是水气变换反应中水蒸气的存在和高压条件。此外，UHV研究可能无法完全捕捉反应条件下催化剂表面的动态性质。尽管存在这些限制，将UHV研究结果与反应器研究和负载型催化剂相关联，可能为理解驱动双金属催化剂增强性能的基本机制提供更全面的认识。
