[1] "The WGS reaction activities over these catalysts decrease as the following order: AuPt/CeO2 > AuNi/CeO2 > Au/CeO2 > AuCu/CeO2 > AuAg/CeO2 > AuPd/CeO2."

[2] "It is very clear that the addition of such as platinum or nickel components brings a positive effect on gold catalysts for WGS reaction."

[3] "Moreover, the introduction of Au and M to ceria makes the size of ceria smaller. According to Scherrer's equation, the average size of ceria particles is 132.4 nm for pure CeO2; 103.5 nm for AuCu/CeO2; 102.3 nm for AuNi/CeO2; 101.1 nm for AuAg/CeO2; 109.1 nm for AuPd/CeO2; and 96.9 nm for AuPt/CeO2."

[4] "For bimetallic AuPt/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles emerges at 145 C and the low-temperature reduction peak of ceria is shifted to at Tmax = 390 C. These results indicated that the coexistence of both Au and Pt is beneficial to the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles and the reduction of surface ceria."

[5] "Besides, the concentration of the surface oxygen of ceria obviously increases in the presence of Pt. It causes the formation of oxygen vacancies, located mainly on the catalyst surface. This is why the bimetallic Au and Pt catalysts possess the higher WGS reaction activity than monometallic Au/CeO2 or Pt/CeO2 catalyst."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of the water gas shift (WGS) reaction in several ways:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity: The addition of platinum to gold catalysts supported on ceria (AuPt/CeO2) shows the highest activity among the bimetallic catalysts studied for the WGS reaction. This indicates that platinum has a strong positive effect on the catalytic performance.

2. Particle size reduction: The introduction of Au and Pt to ceria reduces the size of ceria particles. Smaller particle sizes generally lead to increased surface area and potentially more active sites for catalysis.

3. Improved reducibility: The coexistence of Au and Pt facilitates the reduction of oxygen species on fine gold particles and the reduction of surface ceria. This enhanced reducibility likely contributes to the higher catalytic activity.

4. Oxygen vacancy formation: The presence of Pt increases the concentration of surface oxygen on ceria and promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies. These vacancies are crucial for the WGS reaction mechanism and contribute to the higher activity of bimetallic Au-Pt catalysts compared to monometallic versions.

5. Synergistic effects: The combination of Au and Pt creates synergistic effects that are not present in the individual metals, leading to superior catalytic performance.

While the current study focuses on reactor studies, future UHV (ultra-high vacuum) studies could provide valuable insights by:

1. Investigating the atomic-scale structure and interactions between Au, Pt, and ceria surfaces.
2. Studying the adsorption and reaction mechanisms of CO and H2O on model AuPt/CeO2 surfaces.
3. Examining the formation and role of oxygen vacancies under controlled conditions.
4. Correlating the electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces with their catalytic activity.

However, it's important to note that UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may face limitations in replicating the exact conditions of practical catalysts, particularly in terms of pressure and the presence of water vapor. Bridging the gap between UHV studies and realistic catalytic conditions remains a challenge in this field.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的催化剂，通过以下几种方式显著影响水气变换（WGS）反应的机理和效率：

1. 提高催化活性：在氧化铈（CeO2）支撑的金催化剂中添加铂（AuPt/CeO2）显示出研究的双金属催化剂中最高的WGS反应活性。这表明铂对催化性能有很强的正面影响。

2. 粒子尺寸减小：将Au和Pt引入氧化铈会减小氧化铈颗粒的尺寸。较小的粒子尺寸通常会导致表面积增加，可能会产生更多的催化活性位点。

3. 提高还原性：Au和Pt的共存促进了细小金颗粒上氧物种的还原和表面氧化铈的还原。这种增强的还原性可能有助于提高催化活性。

4. 氧空位形成：Pt的存在增加了氧化铈表面氧的浓度，并促进了氧空位的形成。这些空位对WGS反应机理至关重要，并有助于双金属Au-Pt催化剂比单金属版本具有更高的活性。

5. 协同效应：Au和Pt的组合创造了单个金属中不存在的协同效应，从而导致更优越的催化性能。

虽然当前的研究集中在反应器研究上，但未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会提供宝贵的见解，通过：

1. 研究Au、Pt和氧化铈表面之间的原子尺度结构和相互作用。
2. 研究CO和H2O在模型AuPt/CeO2表面上的吸附和反应机理。
3. 在受控条件下检查氧空位的形成和作用。
4. 将双金属表面的电子性质与其催化活性相关联。

然而，需要注意的是，基于Pt的双金属表面的UHV研究在复制实际催化剂的确切条件方面可能面临限制，特别是在压力和水蒸气存在方面。在这一领域中，弥合UHV研究与实际催化条件之间的差距仍然是一个挑战。
