[1] "The action of platinum in AuPt/CeO2 catalyst was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction, hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction, UVvis diffuse reflection spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."

[2] "The AuPt/CeO2 catalyst displays a higher activity than other catalysts. The WGS reaction activities over these catalysts decrease as the following order: AuPt/CeO2 > AuNi/CeO2 > Au/CeO2 > AuCu/CeO2 > AuAg/CeO2 > AuPd/CeO2."

[3] "For bimetallic AuPt/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles emerges at 145 C and the low-temperature reduction peak of ceria is shifted to at Tmax = 390 C. These results indicated that the coexistence of both Au and Pt is beneficial to the reduction of oxygen species on the fine gold particles and the reduction of surface ceria."

[4] "The presence of Ce(III) implies the defect structure CeO2x due to oxygen vacancies. This transformation of Ce(IV) to Ce(III) driven by oxygen vacancies may be the key to understanding the catalytic properties of ceria."

[5] "Besides, the concentration of the surface oxygen of ceria obviously increases in the presence of Pt. It causes the formation of oxygen vacancies, located mainly on the catalyst surface. This is why the bimetallic Au and Pt catalysts possess the higher WGS reaction activity than monometallic Au/CeO2 or Pt/CeO2 catalyst."

The literature provides insights into how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the water gas shift (WGS) reaction mechanisms and efficiencies:

1. AuPt/CeO2 catalysts show higher activity for WGS reaction compared to other bimetallic combinations, suggesting a synergistic effect between Au and Pt.

2. The presence of both Au and Pt promotes the reduction of oxygen species on gold particles and surface ceria, enhancing catalytic activity.

3. Pt addition increases the concentration of surface oxygen on ceria and promotes oxygen vacancy formation, which is crucial for WGS reaction activity.

4. The transformation of Ce(IV) to Ce(III) driven by oxygen vacancies is key to understanding the catalytic properties of ceria-supported catalysts.

5. Bimetallic AuPt catalysts show higher WGS reaction activity than monometallic Au/CeO2 or Pt/CeO2 catalysts due to enhanced oxygen vacancy formation and surface oxygen concentration.

The literature does not provide information on CO oxidation or methane conversion reactions. It also does not discuss UHV studies or their potential insights. To fully address these aspects, further research focusing specifically on those topics would be necessary.

该文献提供了关于Pt基双金属催化剂如何影响水气变换(WGS)反应机理和效率的见解：

1. AuPt/CeO2催化剂相比其他双金属组合显示出更高的WGS反应活性，表明Au和Pt之间存在协同效应。

2. Au和Pt的共同存在促进了金颗粒上氧物种和表面氧化铈的还原，增强了催化活性。

3. Pt的添加增加了氧化铈表面氧的浓度，促进氧空位的形成，这对WGS反应活性至关重要。

4. 由氧空位驱动的Ce(IV)到Ce(III)的转变是理解氧化铈负载催化剂催化性能的关键。

5. 双金属AuPt催化剂由于增强的氧空位形成和表面氧浓度，显示出比单金属Au/CeO2或Pt/CeO2催化剂更高的WGS反应活性。

该文献没有提供关于CO氧化或甲烷转化反应的信息。它也没有讨论超高真空(UHV)研究或其潜在见解。要全面解决这些方面的问题，需要进行专门针对这些主题的进一步研究。
