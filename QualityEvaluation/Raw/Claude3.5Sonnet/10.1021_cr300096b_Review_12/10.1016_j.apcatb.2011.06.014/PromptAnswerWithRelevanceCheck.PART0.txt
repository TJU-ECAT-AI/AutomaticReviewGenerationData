[1] "The PtSnOx system has been studied for many years as it has shown to catalyze the CO oxidation at moderate temperatures (ca. 120 C), where neither platinum nor tin dioxide alone has stable activity. The high activity of PtSnOx system has been ascribed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism in which Pt provides the adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx"

[2] "Considering the fact that the outlet of the WGS units of a fuel processor has methane independent from the type of hydrocarbon fed to the reformer unit, the effect of methane presence in the feed must be studied for a PROX catalyst."

[3] "Owing to that, the necessity of O-spillover (or transfer) through the support is completely eliminated. Thus, on the basis of our current experimental results and our previous experimental and theoretical findings as well, we can suggest a basic CO oxidation surface mechanism for CO and O2-only feed on Pt3Sn sites"

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtSn systems, significantly influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies. The PtSnOx system exhibits synergistic bifunctional activity, where Pt provides CO adsorption sites while SnOx dissociatively adsorbs oxygen. This allows CO oxidation at moderate temperatures (~120°C) where neither metal alone is stable.

For water gas shift (WGS) reactions, the literature doesn't provide specific information on bimetallic catalyst effects. However, it mentions that WGS unit effluents contain methane, suggesting methane's presence should be considered in preferential oxidation (PROX) catalyst studies.

Regarding methane conversion, the document doesn't provide direct information on bimetallic catalyst effects. It only suggests that methane's presence in the feed stream should be studied for PROX catalysts.

The study provides insights into CO oxidation mechanisms on Pt3Sn sites, eliminating the need for oxygen spillover through the support. This finding correlates surface mechanisms with the structure of supported catalysts.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide more detailed insights into the atomic-scale interactions between reactants and bimetallic surfaces, helping to bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts. They could also elucidate the role of support materials and the formation of active sites in real catalytic systems. However, the current literature doesn't discuss limitations of UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, so further research in this area could be valuable.

双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是PtSn系统，显著影响CO氧化机理和效率。PtSnOx系统表现出协同双功能活性，其中Pt提供CO吸附位点，而SnOx解离吸附氧气。这使得CO在适度温度（约120°C）下氧化，而单独的金属在此温度下不稳定。

对于水气变换（WGS）反应，文献没有提供关于双金属催化剂效果的具体信息。然而，它提到WGS单元的流出物含有甲烷，表明在优先氧化（PROX）催化剂研究中应考虑甲烷的存在。

关于甲烷转化，文档没有提供双金属催化剂效果的直接信息。它只是建议应该研究进料流中甲烷存在对PROX催化剂的影响。

该研究提供了Pt3Sn位点上CO氧化机理的见解，消除了通过支持物进行氧溢流的需要。这一发现将表面机理与支持催化剂的结构相关联。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会提供更详细的反应物与双金属表面之间原子尺度相互作用的见解，有助于弥合模型表面和支持催化剂之间的差距。它们还可以阐明支持材料的作用和实际催化系统中活性位点的形成。然而，现有文献并未讨论UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的局限性，因此这一领域的进一步研究可能会很有价值。

The high activity of PtSnOx system has been ascribed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism in which Pt provides the adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx"

[2] "The results clearly showed that the CO oxidation performance of the catalyst strongly depends on Pt:Sn loading ratio, preparation procedure and AC pretreatment. The results hinted that the active phase on PtSn catalyst prepared on nitric acid oxidized activated carbon (AC-N) is the Pt3Sn alloy."

[3] "Schubert et al. have investigated PROX on vulcan supported PtSn catalysts and obtained higher activity and selectivity than commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at low temperatures. Their temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), in situ diffuse reflectance IR Fourier transform spectroscopy, and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) measurements revealed that (i) CO surface coverage on the metallic particles is high and decreases with temperature, (ii) only part of the Sn is reduced, included in PtSn alloy particles, while another part forms SnOx islands beside the active particles."

[4] "Owing to that, the necessity of O-spillover (or transfer) through the support is completely eliminated. Thus, on the basis of our current experimental results and our previous experimental and theoretical findings as well, we can suggest a basic CO oxidation surface mechanism for CO and O2-only feed on Pt3Sn sites involving the following steps:
1 CO (g) → CO·Pt

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtSn systems, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation through a synergistic bifunctional mechanism. In this mechanism, Pt provides adsorption sites for CO, while Sn or SnOx provides sites for dissociative oxygen adsorption. This arrangement allows for more efficient CO oxidation at moderate temperatures compared to monometallic Pt or SnO2 catalysts.

The performance of these catalysts depends on factors such as the Pt:Sn loading ratio, preparation procedure, and support pretreatment. For instance, PtSn catalysts prepared on nitric acid-oxidized activated carbon (AC-N) form Pt3Sn alloys, which are believed to be the active phase for CO oxidation.

The mechanism of CO oxidation on Pt3Sn sites involves CO adsorption on Pt sites and O2 adsorption on Sn or PtSn sites, followed by reaction between adsorbed CO and O to form CO2. This arrangement eliminates the need for oxygen spillover through the support, which can be a limiting factor in other catalyst systems.

While the literature provides insights into CO oxidation, it does not specifically address the water-gas shift reaction or methane conversion mechanisms for these bimetallic catalysts. Future UHV studies could potentially provide more detailed information on the atomic-scale interactions between CO, O2, and other reactants on well-defined Pt-Sn surfaces. This could help correlate the findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially leading to a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the role of various surface sites in these catalytic processes.

However, it's important to note that there are currently limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, which may make it challenging to directly correlate UHV results with real catalyst behavior under reaction conditions. Overcoming these limitations and developing techniques to bridge the gap between UHV studies and real catalytic systems remains an important area for future research.

双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是PtSn系统，通过协同双功能机制显著影响CO氧化的机理和效率。在这种机制中，Pt提供CO的吸附位点，而Sn或SnOx提供解离氧吸附的位点。与单金属Pt或SnO2催化剂相比，这种排列允许在中等温度下更有效地进行CO氧化。

这些催化剂的性能取决于诸如Pt:Sn负载比、制备程序和载体预处理等因素。例如，在硝酸氧化的活性炭（AC-N）上制备的PtSn催化剂形成Pt3Sn合金，被认为是CO氧化的活性相。

Pt3Sn位点上CO氧化的机理涉及CO在Pt位点上的吸附和O2在Sn或PtSn位点上的吸附，随后吸附的CO和O反应形成CO2。这种排列消除了通过载体进行氧溢出的需要，这在其他催化剂系统中可能是一个限制因素。

虽然文献提供了关于CO氧化的见解，但并未具体讨论这些双金属催化剂的水气变换反应或甲烷转化机理。未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会提供更详细的信息，关于CO、O2和其他反应物在well-defined Pt-Sn表面上的原子尺度相互作用。这可能有助于将反应器研究的发现与模型表面和负载催化剂相关联，潜在地导致对反应机理和各种表面位点在这些催化过程中的作用有更好的理解。

然而，需要注意的是，目前在Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究中存在一些限制，这可能使得难以直接将UHV结果与实际反应条件下的催化剂行为相关联。克服这些限制并开发技术来弥合UHV研究与实际催化系统之间的差距仍然是未来研究的一个重要领域。

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtSn systems, significantly influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in reactor studies. The PtSnOx system shows high activity for CO oxidation at moderate temperatures (around 120°C) due to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism. In this mechanism, Pt provides adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx. 

For the Pt3Sn alloy, CO adsorption appears to be chemical in nature and activated, though it doesn't follow standard adsorption models. The alloy structure eliminates the need for oxygen spillover through the support, allowing for a direct CO oxidation mechanism on the bimetallic surface.

The study doesn't provide specific information about the influence of these catalysts on water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. However, the detailed CO oxidation mechanism proposed for the Pt3Sn system provides valuable insights that could be correlated with model surfaces in future UHV studies.

Current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not explicitly discussed in this text. However, future UHV studies could potentially provide more detailed atomic-scale insights into the adsorption and reaction mechanisms observed in these reactor studies, particularly regarding the nature of CO adsorption on Pt sites and oxygen adsorption on Sn sites in the bimetallic system. This could help bridge the gap between model surfaces, supported catalysts, and real reactor conditions.

In this mechanism, Pt provides adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx.

Studies on vulcan-supported PtSn catalysts have shown higher activity and selectivity for preferential oxidation (PROX) compared to commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalysts at low temperatures. These studies revealed high CO surface coverage on metallic particles, decreasing with temperature. Additionally, only part of the Sn is reduced and included in PtSn alloy particles, while another part forms SnOx islands beside the active particles.

FTIR-DRIFTS-MS and adsorption studies confirmed enhanced CO chemisorption on PtSn/AC-N catalysts compared to Pt/AC-N. Specifically, linearly adsorbed CO was observed only for PtSn/AC-N, while bridged adsorbed CO was not present.

Regarding the water gas shift (WGS) reaction, the PtSn/AC-N catalyst was found to be inactive at 150°C, eliminating the possibility of CO conversion due to WGS at elevated temperatures.

For methane conversion, the literature does not provide specific information about the influence of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into the atomic-scale mechanisms of these reactions on model surfaces, which could then be correlated with the behavior of supported catalysts. These studies could help elucidate the exact nature of the active sites, the role of the support, and the influence of particle size and composition on catalytic activity. However, the current literature does not discuss the limitations of UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, so further research in this area would be beneficial.

对碳黑负载的PtSn催化剂的研究表明，在低温下，其优先氧化（PROX）活性和选择性高于商业Pt/Al2O3催化剂。这些研究揭示了金属颗粒上CO表面覆盖率高，随温度降低而减少。此外，只有部分Sn被还原并包含在PtSn合金颗粒中，而另一部分在活性颗粒旁形成SnOx岛。

FTIR-DRIFTS-MS和吸附研究证实，与Pt/AC-N相比，PtSn/AC-N催化剂上的CO化学吸附增强。具体来说，只在PtSn/AC-N上观察到线性吸附的CO，而桥接吸附的CO不存在。

关于水气变换（WGS）反应，发现PtSn/AC-N催化剂在150°C下无活性，排除了在高温下由于WGS引起CO转化的可能性。

对于甲烷转化，文献没有提供关于铂基双金属催化剂影响的具体信息。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会为这些反应在模型表面上的原子尺度机理提供见解，这些见解可以与负载催化剂的行为相关联。这些研究可以帮助阐明活性位点的确切性质、载体的作用以及粒子大小和组成对催化活性的影响。然而，当前文献并未讨论UHV研究在铂基双金属表面上的局限性，因此在这一领域进行进一步研究将是有益的。

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtSn systems, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies:

1. For CO oxidation, PtSn catalysts show higher activity and selectivity at lower temperatures compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. This is attributed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism where Pt provides CO adsorption sites while SnOx provides dissociative oxygen adsorption sites.

2. The PtSn system catalyzes CO oxidation at moderate temperatures (around 120°C) where neither Pt nor SnO2 alone shows stable activity. This highlights the importance of the bimetallic interaction.

3. In PtSn catalysts, only part of the Sn is reduced and included in PtSn alloy particles, while another part forms SnOx islands beside the active particles. This structure contributes to the catalyst's enhanced performance.

4. For methane conversion, the presence of CH4 in the feed reduced CO conversion, likely due to adsorption competition between CH4 and CO oxidation reactants. This suggests that bimetallic catalysts may not necessarily improve methane conversion.

5. The study proposes a basic CO oxidation mechanism on Pt3Sn sites, involving CO adsorption on Pt and O2 adsorption on Sn or PtSn sites, eliminating the need for O-spillover through the support.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by:

1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts under controlled conditions.
2. Studying the adsorption and reaction mechanisms of CO, O2, and CH4 on well-defined Pt-Sn surfaces.
3. Examining the role of SnOx islands and their interaction with Pt in the catalytic process.
4. Comparing the behavior of model surfaces with supported catalysts to bridge the gap between UHV studies and real catalytic systems.

These UHV studies could help correlate the findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the catalytic processes and guiding the design of more efficient bimetallic catalysts.

双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是PtSn系统，显著影响了反应器研究中CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机理和效率：

1. 对于CO氧化，PtSn催化剂在较低温度下表现出比单金属Pt催化剂更高的活性和选择性。这归因于协同双功能机制，其中Pt提供CO吸附位点，而SnOx提供解离氧吸附位点。

2. PtSn系统在中等温度（约120°C）下催化CO氧化，而在这个温度下Pt或SnO2单独都不显示稳定活性。这凸显了双金属相互作用的重要性。

3. 在PtSn催化剂中，只有部分Sn被还原并包含在PtSn合金颗粒中，而另一部分在活性颗粒旁形成SnOx岛。这种结构contributes to催化剂的性能提升。

4. 对于甲烷转化，CH4存在于进料中会降低CO转化率，这可能是由于CH4与CO氧化反应物之间的吸附竞争。这表明双金属催化剂可能不一定能改善甲烷转化。

5. 研究提出了Pt3Sn位点上的基本CO氧化机理，涉及CO在Pt上吸附和O2在Sn或PtSn位点上吸附，消除了通过支持物进行O-溢出的需求。

未来的UHV研究可以提供宝贵的见解：

1. 在受控条件下研究Pt基双金属催化剂的表面结构和组成。
2. 研究CO、O2和CH4在明确定义的Pt-Sn表面上的吸附和反应机理。
3. 检查SnOx岛的作用及其与Pt在催化过程中的相互作用。
4. 比较模型表面与负载型催化剂的行为，以弥合UHV研究与实际催化系统之间的差距。

这些UHV研究可以帮助将反应器研究的发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联，提供对催化过程更全面的理解，并指导设计更高效的双金属催化剂。
