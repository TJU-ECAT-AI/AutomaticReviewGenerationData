[1] "The PtSnOx system has been studied for many years as it has shown to catalyze the CO oxidation at moderate temperatures (ca. 120 C), where neither platinum nor tin dioxide alone has stable activity. The high activity of PtSnOx system has been ascribed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism in which Pt provides the adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx"

[2] "Schubert et al. have investigated PROX on vulcan supported PtSn catalysts and obtained higher activity and selectivity than commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at low temperatures. Their temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), in situ diffuse reflectance IR Fourier transform spectroscopy, and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) measurements revealed that (i) CO surface coverage on the metallic particles is high and decreases with temperature, (ii) only part of the Sn is reduced, included in PtSn alloy particles, while another part forms SnOx islands beside the active particles."

[3] "FTIR-DRIFTS-MS and adsorption studies confirmed enhanced CO chemisorption on PtSn/AC-N catalyst compared to that on Pt/AC-N."

[4] "The linearly adsorbed CO band (2054 cm1) was observed only for PtSn/AC-N, however bridged adsorbed CO band which would appear near 1820 cm1, was not present"

[5] "PtSn/AC-N catalyst was tested negative for water gas shift reaction activity at 150 C which eliminates the possibility of CO conversion due to WGS at elevated temperatures."

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtSn systems, significantly influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in reactor studies. The PtSnOx system demonstrates high activity for CO oxidation at moderate temperatures (around 120°C) due to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism. In this mechanism, Pt provides adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx.

Studies on vulcan-supported PtSn catalysts have shown higher activity and selectivity for preferential oxidation (PROX) compared to commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalysts at low temperatures. These studies revealed high CO surface coverage on metallic particles, decreasing with temperature. Additionally, only part of the Sn is reduced and included in PtSn alloy particles, while another part forms SnOx islands beside the active particles.

FTIR-DRIFTS-MS and adsorption studies confirmed enhanced CO chemisorption on PtSn/AC-N catalysts compared to Pt/AC-N. Specifically, linearly adsorbed CO was observed only for PtSn/AC-N, while bridged adsorbed CO was not present.

Regarding the water gas shift (WGS) reaction, the PtSn/AC-N catalyst was found to be inactive at 150°C, eliminating the possibility of CO conversion due to WGS at elevated temperatures.

For methane conversion, the literature does not provide specific information about the influence of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into the atomic-scale mechanisms of these reactions on model surfaces, which could then be correlated with the behavior of supported catalysts. These studies could help elucidate the exact nature of the active sites, the role of the support, and the influence of particle size and composition on catalytic activity. However, the current literature does not discuss the limitations of UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, so further research in this area would be beneficial.

双金属铂基催化剂，特别是PtSn系统，在反应器研究中显著影响了CO氧化机理和效率。PtSnOx系统由于协同双功能机制，在中等温度（约120°C）下表现出高CO氧化活性。在这种机制中，Pt提供CO的吸附位点，而氧气在SnOx上解离吸附。

对碳黑负载的PtSn催化剂的研究表明，在低温下，其优先氧化（PROX）活性和选择性高于商业Pt/Al2O3催化剂。这些研究揭示了金属颗粒上CO表面覆盖率高，随温度降低而减少。此外，只有部分Sn被还原并包含在PtSn合金颗粒中，而另一部分在活性颗粒旁形成SnOx岛。

FTIR-DRIFTS-MS和吸附研究证实，与Pt/AC-N相比，PtSn/AC-N催化剂上的CO化学吸附增强。具体来说，只在PtSn/AC-N上观察到线性吸附的CO，而桥接吸附的CO不存在。

关于水气变换（WGS）反应，发现PtSn/AC-N催化剂在150°C下无活性，排除了在高温下由于WGS引起CO转化的可能性。

对于甲烷转化，文献没有提供关于铂基双金属催化剂影响的具体信息。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会为这些反应在模型表面上的原子尺度机理提供见解，这些见解可以与负载催化剂的行为相关联。这些研究可以帮助阐明活性位点的确切性质、载体的作用以及粒子大小和组成对催化活性的影响。然而，当前文献并未讨论UHV研究在铂基双金属表面上的局限性，因此在这一领域进行进一步研究将是有益的。
