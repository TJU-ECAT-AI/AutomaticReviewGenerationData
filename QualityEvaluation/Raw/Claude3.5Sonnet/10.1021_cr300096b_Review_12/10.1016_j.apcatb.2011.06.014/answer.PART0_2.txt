[1] "The PtSnOx system has been studied for many years as it has shown to catalyze the CO oxidation at moderate temperatures (ca. 120 C), where neither platinum nor tin dioxide alone has stable activity. The high activity of PtSnOx system has been ascribed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism in which Pt provides the adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx"

[2] "The results of the CO adsorption studies indicate that CO adsorption on the samples should have chemical nature. On the other hand, the CO adsorption behavior could not be explained by any of the standard models. Thus, it should be somehow an activated type adsorption besides its  should be  chemical nature."

[3] "Owing to that, the necessity of O-spillover (or transfer) through the support is completely eliminated. Thus, on the basis of our current experimental results and our previous experimental and theoretical findings as well, we can suggest a basic CO oxidation surface mechanism for CO and O2-only feed on Pt3Sn sites involving the following steps:

1
CO (g)  CO·Pt
2
O2 (g)  O·Sn  and/or  O2 (g)  O·PtSn
CO·Pt + O·Sn  CO2 (g)  and/or  CO·Pt + O·PtSn  CO2·(g)"

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtSn systems, significantly influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in reactor studies. The PtSnOx system shows high activity for CO oxidation at moderate temperatures (around 120°C) due to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism. In this mechanism, Pt provides adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx. 

For the Pt3Sn alloy, CO adsorption appears to be chemical in nature and activated, though it doesn't follow standard adsorption models. The alloy structure eliminates the need for oxygen spillover through the support, allowing for a direct CO oxidation mechanism on the bimetallic surface.

The study doesn't provide specific information about the influence of these catalysts on water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. However, the detailed CO oxidation mechanism proposed for the Pt3Sn system provides valuable insights that could be correlated with model surfaces in future UHV studies.

Current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not explicitly discussed in this text. However, future UHV studies could potentially provide more detailed atomic-scale insights into the adsorption and reaction mechanisms observed in these reactor studies, particularly regarding the nature of CO adsorption on Pt sites and oxygen adsorption on Sn sites in the bimetallic system. This could help bridge the gap between model surfaces, supported catalysts, and real reactor conditions.

双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是PtSn系统，在反应器研究中显著影响CO氧化机理和效率。PtSnOx系统由于协同双功能机制，在中等温度（约120°C）下表现出高CO氧化活性。在这种机制中，Pt提供CO的吸附位点，而氧气在SnOx上解离吸附。

对于Pt3Sn合金，CO吸附似乎具有化学性质并且是活化的，尽管它不遵循标准吸附模型。合金结构消除了通过载体进行氧溢流的需求，允许在双金属表面上直接进行CO氧化反应。

该研究没有提供这些催化剂对水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化的影响的具体信息。然而，为Pt3Sn系统提出的详细CO氧化机理为未来的UHV研究提供了可与模型表面相关联的宝贵见解。

本文没有明确讨论当前UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的限制。然而，未来的UHV研究可能会提供更详细的原子尺度洞察，特别是关于双金属系统中CO在Pt位点上的吸附和氧在Sn位点上的吸附性质。这可能有助于弥合模型表面、负载催化剂和实际反应器条件之间的差距。
