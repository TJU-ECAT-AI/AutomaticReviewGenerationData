[1] "The PtSnOx system has been studied for many years as it has shown to catalyze the CO oxidation at moderate temperatures (ca. 120 C), where neither platinum nor tin dioxide alone has stable activity. The high activity of PtSnOx system has been ascribed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism in which Pt provides the adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx"

[2] "The results clearly showed that the CO oxidation performance of the catalyst strongly depends on Pt:Sn loading ratio, preparation procedure and AC pretreatment. The results hinted that the active phase on PtSn catalyst prepared on nitric acid oxidized activated carbon (AC-N) is the Pt3Sn alloy."

[3] "Schubert et al. have investigated PROX on vulcan supported PtSn catalysts and obtained higher activity and selectivity than commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at low temperatures. Their temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), in situ diffuse reflectance IR Fourier transform spectroscopy, and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) measurements revealed that (i) CO surface coverage on the metallic particles is high and decreases with temperature, (ii) only part of the Sn is reduced, included in PtSn alloy particles, while another part forms SnOx islands beside the active particles."

[4] "Owing to that, the necessity of O-spillover (or transfer) through the support is completely eliminated. Thus, on the basis of our current experimental results and our previous experimental and theoretical findings as well, we can suggest a basic CO oxidation surface mechanism for CO and O2-only feed on Pt3Sn sites involving the following steps:
1 CO (g) → CO·Pt 
2 O2 (g) → O·Sn and/or O2 (g) → O·PtSn
CO·Pt + O·Sn → CO2 (g) and/or CO·Pt + O·PtSn → CO2·(g)"

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtSn systems, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation through a synergistic bifunctional mechanism. In this mechanism, Pt provides adsorption sites for CO, while Sn or SnOx provides sites for dissociative oxygen adsorption. This arrangement allows for more efficient CO oxidation at moderate temperatures compared to monometallic Pt or SnO2 catalysts.

The performance of these catalysts depends on factors such as the Pt:Sn loading ratio, preparation procedure, and support pretreatment. For instance, PtSn catalysts prepared on nitric acid-oxidized activated carbon (AC-N) form Pt3Sn alloys, which are believed to be the active phase for CO oxidation.

The mechanism of CO oxidation on Pt3Sn sites involves CO adsorption on Pt sites and O2 adsorption on Sn or PtSn sites, followed by reaction between adsorbed CO and O to form CO2. This arrangement eliminates the need for oxygen spillover through the support, which can be a limiting factor in other catalyst systems.

While the literature provides insights into CO oxidation, it does not specifically address the water-gas shift reaction or methane conversion mechanisms for these bimetallic catalysts. Future UHV studies could potentially provide more detailed information on the atomic-scale interactions between CO, O2, and other reactants on well-defined Pt-Sn surfaces. This could help correlate the findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts, potentially leading to a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the role of various surface sites in these catalytic processes.

However, it's important to note that there are currently limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, which may make it challenging to directly correlate UHV results with real catalyst behavior under reaction conditions. Overcoming these limitations and developing techniques to bridge the gap between UHV studies and real catalytic systems remains an important area for future research.

双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是PtSn系统，通过协同双功能机制显著影响CO氧化的机理和效率。在这种机制中，Pt提供CO的吸附位点，而Sn或SnOx提供解离氧吸附的位点。与单金属Pt或SnO2催化剂相比，这种排列允许在中等温度下更有效地进行CO氧化。

这些催化剂的性能取决于诸如Pt:Sn负载比、制备程序和载体预处理等因素。例如，在硝酸氧化的活性炭（AC-N）上制备的PtSn催化剂形成Pt3Sn合金，被认为是CO氧化的活性相。

Pt3Sn位点上CO氧化的机理涉及CO在Pt位点上的吸附和O2在Sn或PtSn位点上的吸附，随后吸附的CO和O反应形成CO2。这种排列消除了通过载体进行氧溢出的需要，这在其他催化剂系统中可能是一个限制因素。

虽然文献提供了关于CO氧化的见解，但并未具体讨论这些双金属催化剂的水气变换反应或甲烷转化机理。未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会提供更详细的信息，关于CO、O2和其他反应物在well-defined Pt-Sn表面上的原子尺度相互作用。这可能有助于将反应器研究的发现与模型表面和负载催化剂相关联，潜在地导致对反应机理和各种表面位点在这些催化过程中的作用有更好的理解。

然而，需要注意的是，目前在Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究中存在一些限制，这可能使得难以直接将UHV结果与实际反应条件下的催化剂行为相关联。克服这些限制并开发技术来弥合UHV研究与实际催化系统之间的差距仍然是未来研究的一个重要领域。
