          [1] "The PtSnOx system has been studied for many years as it has shown to catalyze the CO oxidation at moderate temperatures (ca. 120 C), where neither platinum nor tin dioxide alone has stable activity. The high activity of PtSnOx system has been ascribed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism in which Pt provides the adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx"

[2] "Schubert et al. have investigated PROX on vulcan supported PtSn catalysts and obtained higher activity and selectivity than commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at low temperatures. Their temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), in situ diffuse reflectance IR Fourier transform spectroscopy, and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) measurements revealed that (i) CO surface coverage on the metallic particles is high and decreases with temperature, (ii) only part of the Sn is reduced, included in PtSn alloy particles, while another part forms SnOx islands beside the active particles."

[3] "Addition of methane to the feed used in SET I. 14 reduced the CO conversion significantly at 135 C from ca. 75% to ca. 50% (Fig. 7a). The chromatographic data showed that there is insignificant methane oxidation at 135 C as well as at other lower temperature levels; thus, the possible explanation for the observed decrease in CO conversion level may be the adsorption competition between CH4 and the CO oxidation reactants."

[4] "Owing to that, the necessity of O-spillover (or transfer) through the support is completely eliminated. Thus, on the basis of our current experimental results and our previous experimental and theoretical findings as well, we can suggest a basic CO oxidation surface mechanism for CO and O2-only feed on Pt3Sn sites involving the following steps:

1 CO (g) → CO·Pt
2 O2 (g) → O·Sn and/or O2 (g) → O·PtSn
CO·Pt + O·Sn → CO2 (g) and/or CO·Pt + O·PtSn → CO2·(g)"

[5] "PtSn/AC-N catalyst was tested negative for water gas shift reaction activity at 150 C which eliminates the possibility of CO conversion due to WGS at elevated temperatures."

          Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtSn systems, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies:

1. CO Oxidation: PtSn catalysts show higher activity and selectivity at lower temperatures compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. This is attributed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism where Pt provides CO adsorption sites while SnOx provides dissociative oxygen adsorption sites. The PtSn system catalyzes CO oxidation at moderate temperatures (around 120°C) where neither Pt nor SnO2 alone shows stable activity.

2. Water Gas Shift Reaction: The PtSn/AC-N catalyst was found to be inactive for the water gas shift reaction at 150°C, eliminating the possibility of CO conversion due to WGS at elevated temperatures.

3. Methane Conversion: The presence of CH4 in the feed reduced CO conversion, likely due to adsorption competition between CH4 and CO oxidation reactants. This suggests that bimetallic catalysts may not necessarily improve methane conversion.

4. Catalyst Structure: In PtSn catalysts, only part of the Sn is reduced and included in PtSn alloy particles, while another part forms SnOx islands beside the active particles. This structure contributes to the catalyst's enhanced performance.

5. Reaction Mechanism: A basic CO oxidation mechanism on Pt3Sn sites is proposed, involving CO adsorption on Pt and O2 adsorption on Sn or PtSn sites, eliminating the need for O-spillover through the support.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by:
1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts under controlled conditions.
2. Studying the adsorption and reaction mechanisms of CO, O2, and CH4 on well-defined Pt-Sn surfaces.
3. Examining the role of SnOx islands and their interaction with Pt in the catalytic process.
4. Comparing the behavior of model surfaces with supported catalysts to bridge the gap between UHV studies and real catalytic systems.

These UHV studies could help correlate the findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the catalytic processes and guiding the design of more efficient bimetallic catalysts.

          双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是PtSn系统，显著影响了反应器研究中CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机理和效率：

1. CO氧化：PtSn催化剂在较低温度下表现出比单金属Pt催化剂更高的活性和选择性。这归因于协同双功能机制，其中Pt提供CO吸附位点，而SnOx提供解离氧吸附位点。PtSn系统在中等温度（约120°C）下催化CO氧化，而在这个温度下Pt或SnO2单独都不显示稳定活性。

2. 水煤气变换反应：PtSn/AC-N催化剂在150°C下对水煤气变换反应无活性，排除了在高温下由于WGS引起CO转化的可能性。

3. 甲烷转化：CH4存在于进料中会降低CO转化率，这可能是由于CH4与CO氧化反应物之间的吸附竞争。这表明双金属催化剂可能不一定能改善甲烷转化。

4. 催化剂结构：在PtSn催化剂中，只有部分Sn被还原并包含在PtSn合金颗粒中，而另一部分在活性颗粒旁形成SnOx岛。这种结构contributes to催化剂的性能提升。

5. 反应机理：研究提出了Pt3Sn位点上的基本CO氧化机理，涉及CO在Pt上吸附和O2在Sn或PtSn位点上吸附，消除了通过支持物进行O-溢出的需求。

未来的UHV研究可以提供宝贵的见解：
1. 在受控条件下研究Pt基双金属催化剂的表面结构和组成。
2. 研究CO、O2和CH4在明确定义的Pt-Sn表面上的吸附和反应机理。
3. 检查SnOx岛的作用及其与Pt在催化过程中的相互作用。
4. 比较模型表面与负载型催化剂的行为，以弥合UHV研究与实际催化系统之间的差距。

这些UHV研究可以帮助将反应器研究的发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联，提供对催化过程更全面的理解，并指导设计更高效的双金属催化剂。
