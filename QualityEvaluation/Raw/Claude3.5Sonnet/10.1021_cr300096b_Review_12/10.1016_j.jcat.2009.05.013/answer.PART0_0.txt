[1] "PtFe/SiO2 samples were found to be more active than monometallic Pt/SiO2 for the oxidation of CO in air. This enhancement of the catalytic activity strongly depends on the degree of electronic interaction between the metals and the strength of CO adsorption."

[2] "Our FTIR data show that the sample with the highest activity for CO oxidation was also characterized by a relatively low strength of CO adsorption."

[3] "Therefore, we can safely conclude that direct contact between Pt and Fe is essential for the enhancement of the Pt activity for the oxidation of CO, as we proposed earlier. Furthermore, our results suggest that such direct contact is better achieved at low Fe contents and leads to a weakening of the adsorption of CO on Pt, which in turn, enhances the rate of CO oxidation."

The literature primarily discusses bimetallic PtFe catalysts for CO oxidation, not the water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. For CO oxidation, PtFe bimetallic catalysts show enhanced activity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. This enhancement is attributed to:

1. Electronic interactions between Pt and Fe
2. Weakening of CO adsorption on Pt
3. Direct contact between Pt and Fe, especially at low Fe contents

The study does not provide insights from UHV studies or discuss correlations with model surfaces. However, future UHV studies could potentially:

1. Investigate the electronic interactions between Pt and Fe on model surfaces
2. Examine CO adsorption strength on various PtFe surface compositions
3. Correlate surface structure and composition with catalytic activity

Such UHV studies could help bridge the gap between supported catalysts and model surfaces, providing atomic-level understanding of the mechanisms involved in CO oxidation on PtFe bimetallic catalysts.

这篇文献主要讨论了PtFe双金属催化剂对CO氧化的影响,而没有涉及水气变换反应或甲烷转化。对于CO氧化,PtFe双金属催化剂与单金属Pt催化剂相比显示出增强的活性。这种增强归因于:

1. Pt和Fe之间的电子相互作用
2. 削弱了CO在Pt上的吸附
3. Pt和Fe之间的直接接触,尤其是在Fe含量较低时

该研究没有提供超高真空(UHV)研究的见解,也没有讨论与模型表面的相关性。然而,未来的UHV研究可能会:

1. 研究模型表面上Pt和Fe之间的电子相互作用
2. 检查各种PtFe表面组成上CO的吸附强度
3. 将表面结构和组成与催化活性相关联

这些UHV研究可以帮助弥合负载型催化剂和模型表面之间的差距,提供PtFe双金属催化剂上CO氧化机理的原子级理解。
