[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."

[2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3  0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The given literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about the influence of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, on CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The text only mentions a study on PtNi bimetallic catalysts for methane reforming with CO2. 

The literature indicates that adding a small amount of Pt (0.3-0.5 wt%) to a Ni catalyst affects the surface properties and catalytic behavior. Specifically, it leads to a decrease in NiO size, easier reduction, and more uniform distribution of nickel metal particles. However, the text does not provide details on reaction mechanisms or efficiencies for the specific reactions mentioned in the question.

The literature does not discuss UHV studies or their limitations regarding Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, so no insights can be drawn about potential future UHV studies or their correlation with reactor studies and supported catalysts.

给定的文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化在反应器研究中的影响的问题。文本仅提到了一项关于PtNi双金属催化剂用于CO2重整甲烷的研究。

文献指出，向Ni催化剂中添加少量Pt（0.3-0.5 wt%）会影响表面性质和催化行为。具体来说，它导致NiO尺寸减小、更容易还原，以及镍金属颗粒分布更均匀。然而，文本并未提供问题中提到的特定反应的反应机理或效率的详细信息。

文献没有讨论UHV研究或其在Pt基双金属表面方面的限制，因此无法就潜在的未来UHV研究或其与反应器研究和负载型催化剂的相关性得出任何见解。
