[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."

[2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3  0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The literature provides limited information specifically addressing the question. It focuses on bimetallic PtNi catalysts for methane reforming with CO2, rather than CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. The study shows that adding small amounts of Pt (0.3-0.5 wt%) to Ni catalysts affects surface properties and catalytic behavior. Specifically, it decreases NiO size, makes reduction easier, and improves nickel particle distribution. However, the document does not discuss mechanisms or efficiencies of the reactions mentioned in the question, nor does it address potential insights from UHV studies. The information provided is insufficient to fully answer the question or draw conclusions about CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, or UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

该文献提供的信息对于回答问题的针对性有限。它主要关注用于CO2甲烷重整的双金属PtNi催化剂，而不是CO氧化或水煤气变换反应。研究表明，向Ni催化剂中添加少量Pt（0.3-0.5重量%）会影响表面性质和催化行为。具体来说，它降低了NiO尺寸，使还原更容易，并改善了镍颗粒的分布。然而，该文档并未讨论问题中提到的反应机理或效率，也没有涉及UHV研究可能提供的潜在见解。提供的信息不足以全面回答问题或得出关于CO氧化、水煤气变换反应或Pt基双金属表面UHV研究的结论。
