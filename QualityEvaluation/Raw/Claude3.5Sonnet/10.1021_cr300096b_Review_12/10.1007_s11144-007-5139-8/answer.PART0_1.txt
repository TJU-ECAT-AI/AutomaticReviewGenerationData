[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."

[2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3  0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about bimetallic catalysts' influence on CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, or potential insights from UHV studies. The document only briefly mentions the effect of Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts on methane reforming with CO2. 

The study indicates that adding a small amount of Pt (0.3-0.5 wt.%) to a Ni catalyst affects the surface properties and catalytic behavior. Specifically, it leads to a decrease in NiO size, easier reduction, and more uniform distribution of nickel metal particles. However, the document does not provide detailed information on reaction mechanisms, efficiencies, or comparisons with UHV studies.

To fully address the question, more comprehensive research on various bimetallic catalysts, their effects on different reactions, and correlations between reactor studies and UHV experiments would be needed.

提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面回答关于双金属催化剂对CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化在反应器研究中的影响，以及UHV研究可能提供的潜在见解。文档仅简要提到了Pt-Ni双金属催化剂对CO2甲烷重整的影响。

研究表明，向Ni催化剂中添加少量Pt（0.3-0.5 wt.%）会影响表面性质和催化行为。具体来说，它导致NiO尺寸减小、更易还原以及镍金属颗粒分布更均匀。然而，该文档没有提供有关反应机理、效率或与UHV研究比较的详细信息。

要全面回答这个问题，需要对各种双金属催化剂、它们对不同反应的影响以及反应器研究与UHV实验之间的相关性进行更全面的研究。
