[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."

[2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3  0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The literature provides limited information to fully answer the question. It focuses specifically on PtNi bimetallic catalysts for methane reforming with CO2, rather than CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. The study shows that adding a small amount of Pt (0.3-0.5 wt%) to a Ni catalyst affects the surface properties and catalytic behavior. Specifically, it leads to decreased NiO size, easier reduction, and more uniform distribution of nickel metal particles. 

The document does not discuss UHV studies or provide insights into correlating reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts. It also does not address the limitations of UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. To fully answer the question, additional research focusing on CO oxidation, water gas shift reactions, and UHV studies of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts would be needed.

文献提供的信息有限，无法完全回答这个问题。它特别关注PtNi双金属催化剂在CO2重整甲烷方面的应用，而不是CO氧化或水气变换反应。研究表明，向镍催化剂中添加少量铂（0.3-0.5 wt%）会影响表面性质和催化行为。具体来说，它导致NiO尺寸减小，更容易还原，以及镍金属颗粒分布更均匀。

该文档未讨论UHV研究，也未提供将反应器研究与模型表面和负载催化剂相关联的见解。它也没有涉及UHV研究在铂基双金属表面上的局限性。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行额外的研究，重点关注CO氧化、水气变换反应以及铂基双金属催化剂的UHV研究。
