[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."

[2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3  0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The literature provides limited information to fully answer the question. It focuses on bimetallic PtNi catalysts for methane reforming with CO2, rather than CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. The study shows that adding a small amount of Pt (0.3-0.5 wt%) to Ni catalysts affects surface properties and catalytic behavior. Specifically, it reduces NiO particle size, facilitates reduction, and improves nickel particle distribution. However, the document does not discuss mechanisms or efficiencies in detail, nor does it mention UHV studies or model surfaces. The information is insufficient to draw conclusions about potential insights from future UHV studies or to make comparisons with supported catalysts.

这篇文献提供的信息有限，无法完全回答问题。它主要关注了用于甲烷与二氧化碳重整的双金属PtNi催化剂，而非一氧化碳氧化或水气变换反应。研究表明，向镍催化剂中添加少量铂（0.3-0.5重量%）会影响表面性质和催化行为。具体来说，它减小了NiO粒子尺寸，促进了还原，并改善了镍粒子的分布。然而，该文档并未详细讨论机理或效率，也没有提到超高真空（UHV）研究或模型表面。这些信息不足以得出关于未来UHV研究可能提供的潜在见解，或与负载型催化剂进行比较的结论。
