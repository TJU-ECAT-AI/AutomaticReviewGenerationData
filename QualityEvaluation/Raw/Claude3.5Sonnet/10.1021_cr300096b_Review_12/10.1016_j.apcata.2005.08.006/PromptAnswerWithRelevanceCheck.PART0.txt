<questions>

How do bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, and what potential insights could future UHV studies provide in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain information specifically related to bimetallic catalysts and CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, or methane conversion mechanisms. The document focuses on PtSn and PtIrSn catalysts for n-heptane reforming, but does not discuss the reactions mentioned in the question. Additionally, there is no information about UHV studies or comparisons between reactor studies and model surfaces. As such, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the given literature.
