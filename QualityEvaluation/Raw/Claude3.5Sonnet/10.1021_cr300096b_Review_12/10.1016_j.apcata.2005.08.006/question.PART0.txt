Catalytic properties in n-heptane reforming of PtSn and PtIrSn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction
Abstract
Multimetallic PtIrSn/Al2O3 catalysts, prepared by surface redox reaction, were tested in the conversion of n-heptane, used as model reaction of paraffin dehydrocyclization, under industrial-type conditions. Their catalytic performances were measured after 5 and 65 h of reaction in order to evaluate the stability of the catalysts, and compared to those of a well-known PtSn bimetallic catalyst as a function of the preparation medium, of the tin and iridium contents, of the chorine content and of the resulting acidity, and of the amount of coke deposited. The addition of tin to the monometallic Pt and to the bimetallic PtIr increases the stability of the catalysts and also the selectivity toward toluene. The same toluene yield is obtained with bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts after 65 h of reaction, but less tin is needed in the case of the trimetallic catalyst. Similar evolutions between the toluene yield and the amount of Lewis acid sites were observed: the highest amount of Lewis sites, the highest toluene yield. There is no simple relationship between the amount of coke deposited after 65 h of reaction and the activity in n-heptane conversion. The coke deposition affects the strong Lewis and Brnsted acid sites. Whereas catalysts are strongly deactivated after 65 h of reaction for cyclohexane dehydrogenation at atmospheric pressure, they are still active for the n-heptane transformation at higher pressures that means that only few metallic sites take part in this reaction. It was demonstrated that the addition of an inactive promoter on a bimetallic PtIr catalyst can replace the sulfiding step that is necessary to decrease the hydrogenolysis activity of this type of catalyst. However, the deposition of tin modifies not only the metal function but also the acidity of the catalyst.
1. Introduction
The reforming of low-octane feed-stocks such as naphthenes and straight-chain paraffins is carried out over bifunctional catalysts which consist mainly of a bimetallic phase, platinum modified by rhenium, iridium or tin dispersed on an acidic support such as chlorinated alumina

Bimetallic catalysts consisting of platinum as the primary metal and a second metal such as rhenium, iridium or tin allow one to improve the activity and the selectivity in aromatization as compared to the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts
[11]

[12]

[13]

[14]
. PtRe and PtIr catalysts are presulfided in industrial reformers in order to decrease the high hydrogenolysis activities of the fresh catalysts. The deactivation observed during naphtha reforming is primarily the consequence of carbonaceous residues building up on the catalyst surface. In the literature, ensemble effects and electronic effects are proposed to explain the lower deactivation by coke of platinum catalysts modified with metal additives

However, PtIr catalysts, even presulfided, exhibited an undesirable hydrogenolysis activity, particularly at high pressure

phase by the addition of an inactive modifier such as tin. In a previous study
[25]
we have investigated the preparation by catalytic reduction and the characterization of the metallic function of alumina-supported bimetallic platinumtin and trimetallic platinumiridiumtin catalysts. It was demonstrated that tin can be deposited by surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a parent monometallic platinum/alumina or on a bimetallic platinumiridium/alumina catalyst and tin chloride (SnCl4) dissolved in hydrochloric medium. This reaction competes with the adsorption of the tin salt on the alumina support but the deposition on the support can be restricted by addition of citric acid. Citric acid leads also to a decrease of the catalyst chlorine content while the latter increases with the tin loading. It was also demonstrated by temperature-programmed reduction that the active metallic phase and tin are in close contact, which was confirmed by a strong inhibiting effect of tin on catalysts activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation.
As the characterization of the metallic functions have already been reported in a previous paper
[25]
, the characterization of the bifunctional catalysts is completed in the present study by the evaluation of the Brnsted and Lewis acidities of the bi and trimetallic catalysts. Then, these catalysts are tested in the conversion of n-heptane, used as model reaction of paraffin dehydrocyclization that may occur in the industrial reforming process. The dehydrocyclization is a reaction to be promoted since it leads to aromatics for petrochemicals industry and also to a large amount of hydrogen. The purpose of the research was to substitute the presulfidation of PtIr catalysts by the addition of tin and to evidence if it is possible to improve the stability of the catalysts and the yield in n-heptane dehydrocyclization under industrial-type conditions by cumulating the beneficial effects of the iridium and tin promoters.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
The support was a γ-alumina (GFS from Procatalyse) with a specific surface area (BET method) of 210 m2 g1, a total pore volume of 0.6 cm3 g1. The support was crushed and sieved in order to retain particles with sizes between 0.25 and 0.40 mm, and calcined in flowing air at 450 C for 4 h.
Mono and bimetallic PtIr/alumina catalysts were prepared by impregnation or coimpregnation of the support with H2PtCl6 and/or H2IrCl6 in an acidic solution (HCl 0.2 M) in order to ensure the interaction between the precursor salts and the alumina surface. After evaporation of the solvent and drying, the Pt and PtIr catalysts were calcined in flowing air at 300 C for 4 h and reduced in flowing hydrogen at 500 C for 4 h. Then, bimetallic PtSn/alumina and trimetallic PtIrSn/alumina catalysts were prepared by deposition of tin by the catalytic reduction method. According to this technique, tin was deposited by surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on the parent catalyst and the tin salt, SnCl4, dissolved in 20 mL of a hydrochloric solution (0.2 M) whether containing citric acid or not (0.2 M). Chloride from hydrochloric acid is a competing agent of the deposition of anionic metal precursors leading to a uniform distribution of the metal within the support. Citric acid could also be used as competitive adsorbate. In addition to a purely competitive effect implying no interactions between adsorbates either on the support surface or in the liquid phase, citric acid, which is made of three acidic functions and one hydroxylic function, may generate steric hindrances effects. For these reasons, citric acid was added in the HCl solution containing SnCl4 salt and the parent PtIr catalyst in order to restrict the deposition of the metal precursor onto the support during the catalytic reduction. Then it may be inferred that citric acid may compete not only with the adsorption of the tin precursor but also with the adsorption of chloride. The experimental procedure was described in detail elsewhere
[25]
.
2.2. Characterization of the acid sites
2.2.1. Fourier transformed infra-red spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine
The Fourier transformed infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine was used to determine the number of Lewis acid sites on the γ-alumina support, chlorinated or not and on the bi and trimetallic catalysts. The samples, pressed into thin wafers (1012 mg cm2), were pretreated under hydrogen at 500 C for 4 h and then evacuated at approximately 106 Torr for 1 h at 400 C. The background spectrum, recorded under identical operating conditions without sample, was systematically subtracted. The samples were exposed to pyridine vapors at a pressure of 20 mbar for 15 min at 150 C. Afterwards, spectra were recorded using a Nicolet-Magna IR 750 spectrometer, after evacuation for 1 h at different temperatures (150, 250 and 350 C). Band intensities were corrected from slight differences in sample weight and band areas were calculated by fitting the spectral profile with a GaussianLorentzian function using IR OMNIC software. The concentration of Lewis acid sites was calculated from the integrated area of the band at 1455 cm1 using the value of the molar extinction coefficient of this band (1.28 cm μmol1) determined by Guisnet et al.
[26]
, in the same conditions and in the same experimental device as those used in the present study. However, the values presented in this study will be only used to qualitatively compare the properties of the different catalysts. The total amount of Lewis acid sites was calculated from the spectrum obtained at 150 C. The distribution of acid strength was evaluated by difference between the amount adsorbed at a given temperature and the amount not desorbed at higher temperature.
2.2.2. 3,3-Dimethylbut-1-ene isomerization
The skeletal isomerization of 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene (33DMB1), a model reaction, was used to characterize the Brnsted acid sites. Indeed, as demonstrated by Kemball et al.
[27]
,
[28]
, the Lewis centres of alumina are not involved in this reaction and the 33DMB1 isomerization is likely to occur through a pure protonic mechanism
[29]
,
[30]
,
[31]
.
Catalyst samples (0.1 g) were treated in flowing hydrogen (60 mL min1) at 500 C, then in flowing air (30 mL min1) at 300 C, in order to deactivate the metallic phase, and then purged under nitrogen. The catalytic reactions were carried out at 250 C under a constant flow of 60 mL min1 of N2 saturated with 33DMB1. Products were analyzed by gas chromatography (Varian 3900) using a flame ionization detector (FID) and a capillary column (Squalanne). The initial 33DMB1 disappearance rates were determined from the initial slope of 33DMB1 concentration versus time and normalized by the BET surface area.
2.3. Conversion of n-heptane
The n-heptane conversion reaction was carried out with 1 g of catalyst in a continuous flow reactor at 5 bar and 500 C. The reactant mixture consisted of a 3:1 H2/nC7 gas mixture, and the space velocity used was 2 h1. Effluent products were analyzed by an on-line chromatograph (Varian 3400) using a FID and equipped with a CP-Sil 5 capillary column.
2.4. TPO analysis
TPO analysis was conducted in order to determine the amount of carbon deposit on catalysts after the catalytic test. The experiments were carried out at ambient pressure in a quartz reactor. The samples were fixed with quartz wool in the reactor. All of the experiments were performed in 1% O2/He gas flow. A moisture trap (Mg(ClO4)2·xH2O) was used to remove water from the gas. Gas composition (CO2 produced and O2 in excess) was analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with a thermoconductivity detector (TCD) and a Porapak Q column. The temperature range was 25700 C with a ramp of 7 C/min.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Role of the metallic and acidic functions in the n-heptane conversion
In order to evaluate the role of the metallic and acidic functions in the n-heptane conversion, the activities of an acidic catalyst, the chlorinated alumina and of a metallic one, presulfided bimetallic 0.30.3Ir deposited on a non-acidic support, silica, were compared to that of a bifunctional catalyst, the presulfided 0.3Pt0.3Ir/ClAl2O3 catalyst. In
Fig. 1
is reported the conversion of n-heptane as a function of time in the presence of these catalysts. This figure shows that the conversion is very low on the acidic support, 30% of n-heptane being converted at the beginning of the reaction, and only 20% after 20 h of reaction. The activity of the bimetallic phase is slightly higher since 30% of n-heptane are converted after 20 h of reaction. On the bifunctional PtIr/Al2O3 catalyst, the conversion is nearly total after 20 h of reaction, confirming that the n-heptane is converted according to a bifunctional mechanism. The yield in toluene is reported in
Fig. 2
as a function of time for the three catalysts. There is practically no formation of toluene on the acidic catalyst. On the contrary, after 20 h of reaction, the yield in toluene in not negligible on the bimetallic PtIr catalyst deposited on silica, indicating that the cyclization could occur on the metallic function, with a direct six-member ring formation, in accordance with the results reported in the literature
[32]
,
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
. However, the yield in toluene is much more important with PtIr supported on chlorinated alumina confirming the predominant role of the dual functional mechanism, occurring on the metallic and the acidic functions
[36]
,
[37]
,
[38]
,
[39]
. As only the metallic function of all the catalysts tested in n-heptane conversion has already been studied in detail in our previous paper
[25]
, it is of a major importance to complete the characterization by determining the acidity of these catalysts.

3.2. Characterization of the acidity of the catalysts
In order to determine the influence of the chlorine content on the acidity of the catalysts, the Brnsted and Lewis acidities were evaluated as a function of the catalyst composition and of the preparation conditions.
3.2.1. Characterization of the Brnsted acidity
3.2.1.1. Effect of citric acid
Bimetallic PtSn and trimetallic PtIrSn catalysts were prepared in HCl 0.2 M in the presence or not of citric acid. Then, at first the effect of the chlorine content on the acidity of the alumina support treated by HCl (0.2 mol L1) or by a mixture of HCl (0.2 mol L1) and citric acid (0.2 mol L1) was evaluated after drying and treatment under hydrogen at 500 C, according to the same procedure as the one used during the preparation of the multimetallic catalysts. The activity in the 33DMB1 isomerization and the chlorine content are reported in
Table 1
for the alumina support treated or not. These results show that the treatment in HCl leads to an increase of the activity in DM33B1 isomerization and then to an increase of the Brnsted acidity, linked to the presence of chlorine species at the alumina surface
[9]
. Indeed, it is well known that chlorine species at the alumina surface have an inductive effect on surface oxygen functional groups, an effect that strengthens the very weak acidic oxide sites. The presence of citric acid in the hydrochloric acid solution leads to a decrease of the chlorine content that involves a decrease of the Brnsted acidity compared to the support treated in HCl alone.
Table 1. Activity in DM33B1 isomerization and chlorine content of the alumina support
Support Activity (mmol h1 m2) Chlorine content (%)
Al2O3 97 0
Al2O3-Cl 480 1.78
Al2O3-Cl treated in HCl + citric acid 257 1.04
Then, the Brnsted acidity, estimated from the activity in 33DMB1 isomerization, and the chlorine content were evaluated for trimetallic 0.3Pt0.3IrxSn/Al2O3 catalysts as a function of the preparation medium (HCl alone or HCl + citric acid). Results are reported in
Table 2
and compared to the one of the parent bimetallic catalyst and to those of the blank catalysts, corresponding to the bimetallic catalyst submitted to the same treatment as the one used to deposit tin, in HCl or in a mixture of HCl and citric acid. The comparison of
Table 1
,
Table 2
shows on the one hand that the Brnsted acidity of the parent catalyst and of the trimetallic catalysts treated in HCl alone is lower than the one of the alumina support after the same treatment. Moreover, the acidity decreases when the amount of tin and the chlorine content in the catalyst increases, irrespective of the treatment medium. The decrease of the acidity when tin is added can be explained by the deposition of the tin phase onto Brnsted sites. But this corresponds also to an increase of the chlorine content that is surprising since it is reported in the literature that the Brnsted acidity increases with the chlorine content. This unusual behaviour can be explained by the preparation conditions. Indeed tin is deposited by catalytic reduction on the parent bimetallic catalyst and is not activated by calcination. It has been shown
[25]
that some tin is deposited on the alumina support. These tin species on alumina are likely to be not in the reduced state and are rather deposited in the form of SnClx species. Then, the chlorine introduced with tin is not directly deposited on the support but is rather in the environment of tin. On the other hand, the acidity of the blank catalyst treated in HCl is slightly higher than the one of the parent catalyst, whereas the chlorine content is equivalent. As it was demonstrated that the blank treatment in HCl under H2 leads to a sintering of metal particles
[25]
, the higher acidity of the blank catalyst can be explained by a release of the Brnsted sites initially occupied by the metal.

Results reported in
Table 2
show likewise that the Brnsted acidity of the catalysts prepared in a hydrochloric acid solution containing citric acid is lower than the one of the catalysts prepared in hydrochloric acid alone in accordance with the lower chlorine content.
In conclusion, the deposition of tin on the bimetallic catalyst induces a decrease of the Brnsted acidity, which is not balanced by the promoting effect of chlorine at the alumina surface.
3.2.1.2. Effect of the iridium content
The 0.6PtxSn/Al2O3, 0.5Pt0.1IrxSn/Al2O3 and 0.3Pt0.3IrxSn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared in a mixture of hydrochloric acid and citric acid were evaluated in the DMB33B1 isomerization. In
Fig. 3
is reported the activity of the three series of catalysts as a function of the tin content. This figure demonstrates that the Brnsted acidity decreases when the tin content increases whatever the catalyst. However, this effect is more pronounced for the 0.5Pt0.1IrxSn/Al2O3 at high tin content.

3.2.2. Characterization of the Lewis sites
The amount of the Lewis acid sites and the distribution of the strength (weak, medium, strong) were estimated using infra-red spectroscopy of pyridine sorption.
3.2.2.1. Characterization of the alumina support
Fig. 4
shows the spectra of the alumina support after pyridine adsorption and desorption at 150, 250 and 350 C. On the spectrum obtained at 150 C, two bands are found in the ν8a mode region, one at 1617 cm1, assigned to pyridine bound to a weaker Lewis acid site and one other at 1624 cm1 corresponding to a stronger acid site
[40]
. Also the band corresponding to the vibration band ν19b is split into two maxima at 1452 and 1455 cm1. The peak at 1452 cm1 disappearing after desorption at 250 C, it can be ascribed to a weak Lewis acid site. The absence of a band at about 1540 cm1 indicates that there are no Brnsted acid sites on the surface strong enough to form pyridinium ions.

3.2.2.2. Effect of the metallic phase
At first, to identify the effect of tin on the bimetallic phase and of the treatment in hydrochloric and citric acids, necessary to deposit tin, the FTIR of pyridine was used to characterize the Lewis acidity of the parent bimetallic 0.5Pt0.1Ir catalyst, treated in hydrochloric acid and citric acid and of the trimetallic 0.5Pt0.1IrxSn/Al2O3 catalysts, as a function of tin content. The spectra of the bimetallic catalyst after treatment in acidic medium and of the trimetallic 0.5Pt0.1Ir0.2Sn are reported in
Fig. 5
. This figure shows that the same bands, characteristic of the Lewis acid sites, are present on both spectra. The total number and the strength of Lewis acid sites, determined by integration of the vibration band (ν19b) at 1452 cm1 after desorption at 150, 250 and 350 C are reported in
Table 3
. The total amount of Lewis sites is reported in
Fig. 6
and in
Table 3
as a function of tin content. The total number increases when the tin content increases up to 0.3 wt.% of tin and then decreases for a tin content equal to 0.38%. This is not in agreement with other results reported in the paper of Passos et al.
[41]
, who observed a decrease of the number of Lewis acid sites when tin is added to platinum. But in their study, catalysts were calcined in air at 500 C for 2 h. In the present study, catalysts modified with tin were calcined at only 300 C
[25]
, in order to remove citric acid that is not sufficient to remove chlorine from the tin precursor. That is confirmed by the results reported in
Table 3
, which show that the chlorine content increases when the amount of tin increases. Then the chlorinated tin species could act as Lewis acid centres. The decrease of the Lewis acidity at higher tin content (0.38 wt.%) can be explained by the deposition of a high amount of tin on the support. Indeed, when tin content is increased, the proportion of tin deposited on the support rather than on the bimetallic PtIr phase is increased
[25]
. Then the poisoning of strong acidic sites of alumina by the deposition of tin can be explained by the presence of tin species on the support
[12]
,
[18]
. As far as the bimetallic PtSn catalyst is concerned (
Fig. 6
), a linear increase of the Lewis acidity is observed with the increase of the tin content. But at the same tin content, the Lewis acidity of the bimetallic catalyst is lower than that of the trimetallic catalyst that should indicate that the active phase plays a direct or indirect role in this acidity. Indeed, the deposition of the PtIr phase could modify the Lewis acidity of the support in a different way from the deposition of platinum alone. The nature of the parent catalyst could also influence the deposition of tin on the metal particle or on the support. Indeed, it was previously observed
[25]
that for the same amount of tin deposited the PtIr phase was more poisoned by tin than the platinum one.

3.3. n-Heptane conversion
n-Heptane conversion was carried out in the presence of catalysts with different iridium and/or tin contents and prepared in a mixture of hydrochloric acid and citric acid. The three series of catalysts evaluated are 0.6PtxSn/Al2O3, 0.5Pt0.1IrxSn/Al2O3 and 0.3Pt0.3IrxSn/Al2O3. At first, the effect of citric acid introduced during the preparation step was studied.
3.3.1. Comparison of the catalytic performances of catalysts prepared in the presence or not of citric acid
Citric acid was added in the preparation medium as a competing agent for the introduction of tin on the parent catalyst by catalytic reduction. Then, the 0.3Pt0.3IrxSn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared in hydrochloric acid in the presence or not of citric acid were evaluated for the n-heptane conversion at 500 C for 65 h.

3.3.1.1. Effect on the global conversion
Fig. 8
shows the n-heptane conversion after 5 h or 65 h of reaction as a function of the tin content. For comparison, the conversion obtained with the parent presulfided bimetallic catalyst is also reported on this figure. After 5 h of reaction, the conversion on catalysts prepared without citric acid is slightly higher than on the other series and the values are close to 100%. On the contrary, the conversion obtained on catalysts prepared in the presence of citric acid decreases slightly as a function of tin content in accordance with
[42]
. As it was demonstrated that the deposition of tin in the presence of a competing agent such as citric acid favours the deposition of tin on or close to the active metallic phases
[25]
, it may be inferred that the decrease in the activity for catalysts prepared in the presence of citric acid can be explained by the modification of the active metallic phase. After 65 h of reaction, the catalysts prepared in citric acid are the most active and the highest conversion is obtained for tin content between 0.15 and 0.25%. Then, catalysts prepared in citric acid, with more tin in interaction with the metallic phase, are more stable than those prepared in hydrochloric acid alone. The increase of the stability of reforming catalysts by addition of tin has already been reported for n-heptane conversion at atmospheric pressure
[41]
that was explained by the dilution by tin of large metallic ensembles, needed to adsorb coke precursors
[18]
,
[19]
. Then, coke precursors are transferred to the alumina surface, leaving the metal surface available for reaction

After 5 h of reaction, the toluene yield obtained with catalysts prepared in the presence of citric and hydrochloric acid decreases with the increase of the tin content whereas the contrary is observed for catalysts prepared in HCl alone. These different behaviours can be explained in terms of accessibility of the active metallic phase on the one hand and on the other hand of acidity resulting from the chlorine content considering a dual functional mechanism
[36]
,
[37]
,
[38]
,
[39]
. The decrease of the toluene yield as a function of the tin content observed with catalysts prepared in the presence of citric acid, can be explained by the poisoning effect of the deposition of tin on the active metallic function, favoured by the presence of the competing agent
[25]
.
After 65 h of reaction, the toluene yield is strongly affected whatever the preparation medium. Nevertheless, catalysts prepared in the presence of citric acid are less sensitive to deactivation, compared to catalysts prepared in hydrochloric acid alone. Then, this confirms that the presence of a competing agent during the deposition of tin yields to more stable catalysts.
In
Table 4
is presented the yield in the main products of the n-heptane conversion as a function of tin content for the two types of preparation medium. In this table is also reported the mole ratio of i-butane to n-butane, characteristic of the balance between the acidity and the metal function, which should be in the range 0.8  0.15 in a catalytic reformer unit
[43]
. It can be seen that only two catalysts are within this range, both prepared in the presence of citric acid and corresponding to a tin content of 0.2 and 0.25%. These two catalysts are also those leading to the highest conversion of n-heptane and the highest toluene yield. Then, it can be inferred that the deposition of a low amount of tin by catalytic reduction in the presence of a competing agent such as citric acid leads to the trimetallic catalysts with a good balance between the acidity and the metal function that leads to the highest performances compared to those prepared in hydrochloric acid alone.

Table 4
shows also that C1 to C4 species are the major products of the n-heptane conversion especially for catalysts prepared in HCl alone at low tin content that is in accordance with the lower toluene yield obtained with these catalysts. The production of methane, occurring preferentially on the active metal function, is rather low, 1.4% at maximum for low tin content and decreases when the tin content increases confirming the poisoning effect of tin on the hydrogenolysis activity. The comparison of the two series, prepared in HCl alone or in the presence of citric acid, shows that the addition of tin in the presence of citric acid leads to a more important decrease of the yield in methane, confirming that the presence of a competing agent favours the deposition of tin on the active metallic phase in accordance with our previous results
[25]
. These results are in accordance with those of Passos et al.
[41]
but not with those of Bowker et al.
[44]
. Indeed, Bowker et al.
[44]
obtained the same behaviour with PtSn catalysts as with Pt-only catalysts, also under near-industrial conditions but with industrial-type catalysts. These different results can be explained in terms of difference in interaction between tin and the active phase, depending on both the preparation and the activation conditions of the catalysts. Indeed, in our study, tin was deposited by catalytic reduction
[25]
in order to favour the interactions between tin and the other metals, and the catalyst is then calcined at only 300 C before reduction to avoid any segregation of the multimetallic phase whereas on an industrial-type a large amount of tin is likely to be deposited on the support rather than on the active platinum phase. Concerning the yield in propane, generally considered as a product characteristic of the acidic cracking, it decreases with the increase of the tin content, in accordance with the acidities reported in
Table 2
. At maximum 15%, of isomerization products are obtained and once again the highest yields correspond to the catalysts prepared in the presence of citric acid.
3.3.1.3. Effect on coke formation
Carbon deposits were analyzed by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) after 65 h of n-heptane conversion. The percentage of coke as a function of tin content is reported in
Fig. 10
. This figure shows that coke deposition is much higher on catalysts prepared in hydrochloric acid alone than in the presence of citric acid. This more important amount of coke on this type of catalyst can be correlated with the higher deactivation observed after 65 h of reaction and also with the higher amount of chlorine present in catalysts prepared in HCl alone. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the increase of chlorine content leads to an increase of carbonaceous deposits on alumina containing the same metallic function
[44]
,
[45]
. However, the coke deposition decreases in parallel with the Brnsted acidity when the tin content increases, whereas the chlorine content and the Lewis acidity increase. Then, the coke deposition would be principally related to the Brnsted acidity.

To conclude on the effect of the addition of citric acid in the preparation medium on the catalytic properties of the trimetallics, catalysts prepared in such conditions are more stable, higher conversions and less coke deposition being observed after 65 h of reaction than catalysts prepared in HCl alone. Moreover, the toluene yield is higher with less gaseous products. Then, in the following, all the catalysts tested will be prepared in a mixture of citric acid and hydrochloric acid.
3.3.2. Effect of the iridium content
In order to study the effect of the iridium content on the catalytic properties, four parent catalysts with various iridium contents have been used to deposit tin: 0.5Pt/Al2O3, 0.3Pt0.3Ir/Al2O3, 0.5Pt0.1Ir/Al2O3 and 0.55Ir0.05Ir/Al2O3.
3.3.2.1. Effect on the global conversion
The four series of catalysts were tested in n-heptane conversion. After 5 h of reaction, the conversion is higher than 95%, except for the 0.3Pt0.3IrxSn catalyst. After 65 h of reaction, all the catalysts are deactivated, but to a different extent. Results after 65 h of reaction are reported in
Fig. 11
as a function of the tin content. For comparison, the conversion obtained with the parent presulfided mono or bimetallic catalyst, corresponding to a tin content equal to zero, is also reported on this figure. The behaviour of the two tested 0.55Pt0.05IrxSn/Al2O3 catalysts is similar to that of the 0.5Pt0.1IrxSn/Al2O3 catalysts. At low tin content, the conversion decreases as a function of the iridium content in the following order: 0.5Pt0.1IrxSn/Al2O3  0.55Pt0.05IrxSn/Al2O3 > 0.3Pt0.3IrxSn/Al2O3 > 0.6PtxSn/Al2O3. That means that the addition of small amount of iridium increases the stability of platinum. On the contrary, at highest tin content, the highest conversion is obtained with 0.6PtxSn/Al2O3 and the conversion decreases in the following order: 0.6PtxSn/Al2O3  0.5Pt0.1IrxSn/Al2O3 > 0.3Pt0.3IrxSn/Al2O3.

This result can be explained by the promoting effect of tin, which increases the stability of platinum in the same way as small amounts of iridium.
In the presence of small amounts of iridium, the highest conversion and then the highest stability are obtained with a lower tin content than in the bimetallic PtSn catalysts. Then, the promoting effect of tin depends also on the nature of the active phase.
3.3.2.2. Effect on the toluene yield
Fig. 12
a and b show the amount of n-heptane converted in toluene in 5 and 65 h over catalysts with different iridium contents as a function of tin content. The comparison of the toluene yield after 5 and 65 h shows that the global conversion decrease observed after 65 h of reaction can be attributed mainly to a decrease of the dehydrocyclization activity and the curves of
Fig. 12
,
Fig. 11
present similar evolutions as a function of tin and iridium content. At low tin content, lower than 0.4 wt.%, catalysts with 0.1% or even 0.05 wt.% of iridium present the highest conversion of n-heptane in toluene after 65 h of reaction whereas the bimetallic catalysts are the less active. Moreover, note that for the bimetallic 0.6PtxSn and the trimetallic 0.5Pt0.1IrxSn catalysts, the evolution of the toluene yield follows the evolution of the Lewis acidity as a function of tin content. Indeed, for the trimetallic, the higher molar percentage of toluene is obtained for a tin content equal to about 0.3 wt.% of tin, which corresponds to the trimetallic catalyst with the highest Lewis acidity, whereas for the bimetallic the linear increase of the toluene yield follows the linear increase of the Lewis acid sites as a function of the tin content, as presented in
Fig. 6

3.3.2.3. Effect on the formation of gaseous products and isomerization products
The amount of gaseous products is reported in
Fig. 13
as a function of tin content after 5 and 65 h of n-heptane conversion over catalysts with different iridium contents. This figure shows that the amount of gaseous products decreases very slightly as a function of time. That means that a majority of sites responsible for cracking remain active after 65 h of reaction or are deactivated at the beginning of the reaction, during the first 5 h. Moreover, the C1C4 yield is lower on the catalysts with a low iridium content (0.05 and 0.1 wt.%).

As displayed in
Fig. 14
, it can be noticed that the yield in isomerization products after 5 h of reaction increases with the tin content for catalysts containing iridium whereas it does not depend on the tin content for the bimetallic 0.6PtxSn/Al2O3 catalyst. After 65 h, the yield of isomerization products is more important than after 5 h whatever the catalyst and this increase is more pronounced on catalysts with low tin content. So, catalysts with low tin content are as selective in isomerization products and even more than their counterparts with high tin content. This increase in the isomer yield as a function of time can be explained by a poisoning of strong acid sites, responsible for the cracking reactions, as reported in the literatures
[46]
,
[47]
. As a consequence, the n-heptane would be isomerized on less acidic sites. This hypothesis will be verified in the following by determining the acidity of the catalysts after n-heptane conversion.

3.3.2.4. Effect on coke formation
Carbon deposits were analyzed by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) after 65 h of n-heptane conversion. The percentage of coke as a function of tin content is reported in
Fig. 15
. As it was previously observed for the 0.3Pt0.3IrxSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the percentage of coke deposited decreases when the tin content increases whatever the iridium content may be. However, catalysts with low iridium content leads to less coke deposited than the others, especially for tin content higher than 0.25%. The percentage of coke deposited on the catalyst after 65 h of n-heptane conversion decreases in the order: 0.6PtxSn/Al2O3 > 0.3Pt0.3IrxSn/Al2O3 > 0.5Pt0.1IrxSn/Al2O3  0.5Pt0.05IrxSn/Al2O3.

The comparison of these results with those presented in
Fig. 10
demonstrates that there is no simple relationship between the amount of coke deposited and the activity in n-heptane conversion at 65 h. The deactivation depends also on the type of coke produced and where that coke is deposited [48,49]. For example, the 0.6Pt0.5Sn/Al2O3 catalyst presents the highest activity whereas it also contents the highest coke percentage compared to the other catalysts with the same tin content. However, in most cases, the highest conversion, the lowest amount of coke. In order to evaluate the deactivation of the metallic phase, some samples were tested in cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction at 300 and 350 C after 65 h of n-heptane conversion, according to the experimental conditions presented in [25]. They were totally inactive at these temperatures. The 0.5Pt0.1Ir0.2Sn/Al2O3 catalyst was also tested at 500 C. Whereas the fresh catalyst presented a cyclohexane conversion of 25% at this temperature, after n-heptane conversion it is able to convert only 2.5% of cyclohexane in the same experimental conditions. These results prove that the metal function is also strongly affected by the deposition of coke, which leads to a deactivation of the catalyst for cyclohexane dehydrogenation at atmospheric pressure. Whereas catalysts are strongly deactivated after 65 h of reaction for cyclohexane dehydrogenation at atmospheric pressure, they are still active for the n-heptane transformation at higher pressures that means that only few metallic sites take part in this reaction.
3.3.3. Effect of the coke deposition on the acidity
In
Table 5
are presented the Brnsted acidities of fresh and tested catalysts, after 65 h of reaction. These results seem to confirm that the Brnsted sites are mainly responsible for the coke deposition since they are strongly deactivated for the 33DMB1 isomerization after 65 h of reaction. Moreover, the catalyst prepared in hydrochloric acid, which is the most acidic before reaction, is more strongly deactivated than the other catalysts prepared in the presence of citric acid.
Table 5. Effect of the coke deposition on the Brnsted acidity of various catalysts evaluated by the activity in DM33B1 isomerization

As far as the Lewis acidity is concerned, the total amount of Lewis sites and their distribution, determined by FTIR of adsorbed pyridine, are presented in
Fig. 16
before and after 65 h of n-heptane conversion. From this figure, it is observed that the presence of coke leads to a decrease of the amount of Lewis acid sites, confirming the hypothesis of Beltramini and Trimm [46], which can be ascribed to the decrease of the number of strong acid sites, confirming the hypothesis concerning the isomerization of n-heptane on less acidic sites.

To conclude, the both type of acidities, corresponding to the Brnsted and Lewis sites, are poisoned by the deposition of coke.
4. Conclusion
PtIrSn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by surface redox reactions were tested in n-heptane conversion under near-industrial conditions. Their catalytic performances were evaluated after 5 and 65 h of reaction and were compared as a function of the preparation medium, of the tin and iridium contents, of the chorine content and of the resulting acidity, and of the amount of coke deposited.
The presence of chlorine on the alumina support strongly increases its Brnsted acidity. The deposition of tin on the bimetallic catalyst induces a decrease of the Brnsted acidity, which is not balanced by the promoting effect of chlorine at the alumina surface, confirming that tin is deposited on both the bimetallic phase and the support. Moreover, the presence of citric acid, leading to the decrease of the chlorine content, induces a drop of the Brnsted acidity. As far as Lewis acidity is concerned, in our activation conditions, the presence of chlorine, provided by the tin precursor, in the environment of tin, is likely to be at the origin of a part of the Lewis acidity. The Lewis acidity is also influenced by the nature of the parent metallic phase.
The effect of the addition of citric acid in the preparation medium is to decrease the initial activity in n-heptane conversion and to increase the stability of the trimetallic catalysts, compared to those prepared in hydrochloric acid, by favouring the interaction between tin and the active metallic phase, by decreasing the chlorine content and then the Brnsted acidity. Moreover, the toluene yield is increased with lower cracking and hydrogenolysis activities, leading to less gaseous products.
It seems that the toluene yield is a function of the amount of Lewis acid sites for both bimetallic PtSn and trimetallic PtIrSn catalysts, the highest the toluene yield, the highest the total amount of Lewis acid sites. The addition of tin increases the stability of the catalysts and also the selectivity toward toluene. Moreover, the same toluene yield is obtained with bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts after 65 h of n-heptane conversion. However, less tin is needed in the case of the trimetallic catalysts.
The coke deposition induces a decrease of the amount of strong Lewis and Brnsted acid sites. This decrease of the amount of strong Lewis acid sites involves an increase in the isomer yield. There is no simple relationship between the amount of coke and the activity in n-heptane conversion after 65 h of reaction. However, in most cases the highest conversion, the lowest amount of coke laid-down. It seems that only few metallic sites take part in the n-heptane conversion at high-pressure since the metal function is strongly affected by the presence of coke but the catalysts remain active after 65 h of reaction.
To conclude, it was demonstrated in the present study that the addition of an inactive promoter on a bimetallic PtIr catalyst can replace the sulfiding step that is necessary to decrease the hydrogenolysis activity of this type of catalyst. However, the deposition of tin modifies not only the metal function but also the acidity of the catalyst.
