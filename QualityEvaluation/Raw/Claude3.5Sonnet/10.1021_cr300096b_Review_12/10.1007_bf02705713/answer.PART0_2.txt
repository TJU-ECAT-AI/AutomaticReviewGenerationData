[1] "Selective CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over supported Pt catalysts promoted with various transition metal compounds such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Zr."

[2] "Among them, Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 showed high CO conversions over wide reaction temperatures."

[3] "The catalytic activity at low temperatures increased with increasing the molar ratio of Ni/Pt. This accompanied the TPR peak shift to lower temperatures."

[4] "The bimetallic phase of Pt-Ni seems to give rise to stable activity with high CO2 selectivity in selective oxidation of CO in H2-rich stream."

The literature provides some insights into how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies. Specifically, it discusses the selective CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen using supported Pt catalysts promoted with various transition metals. The study found that Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed high CO conversions across a wide range of reaction temperatures. The catalytic activity at low temperatures increased with a higher Ni/Pt molar ratio, which was associated with a shift in TPR peaks to lower temperatures. The bimetallic Pt-Ni phase appeared to provide stable activity with high CO2 selectivity in the selective oxidation of CO in hydrogen-rich streams.

However, the literature does not provide information on water gas shift reactions or methane conversions. It also does not discuss potential insights from future UHV studies or correlations with model surfaces and supported catalysts. The document is focused on CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich environments and does not address the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed to explore the effects of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts on water gas shift reactions and methane conversions, as well as the potential insights from UHV studies and their correlations with reactor studies.

文献提供了一些关于基于铂的双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化机制和效率的见解。具体来说，它讨论了在过量氢气存在下使用由各种过渡金属促进的负载型铂催化剂进行选择性CO氧化的研究。研究发现，Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂在广泛的反应温度范围内表现出高CO转化率。在低温下，随着Ni/Pt摩尔比的增加，催化活性增加，这与TPR峰向低温方向移动有关。双金属Pt-Ni相似乎在富氢气流中选择性氧化CO时提供了稳定的活性和高CO2选择性。

然而，该文献没有提供关于水气变换反应或甲烷转化的信息。它也没有讨论未来UHV研究的潜在见解或与模型表面和负载催化剂的相关性。该文档主要集中在富氢环境中的CO氧化，没有涉及当前UHV研究在基于铂的双金属表面上的局限性。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要进行额外的研究，以探讨基于铂的双金属催化剂对水气变换反应和甲烷转化的影响，以及UHV研究的潜在见解及其与反应器研究的相关性。
