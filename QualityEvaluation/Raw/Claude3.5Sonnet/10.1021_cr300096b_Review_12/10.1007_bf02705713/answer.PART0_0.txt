[1] "Selective CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over supported Pt catalysts promoted with various transition metal compounds such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Zr."

[2] "Among them, Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 showed high CO conversions over wide reaction temperatures."

[3] "The catalytic activity at low temperatures increased with increasing the molar ratio of Ni/Pt. This accompanied the TPR peak shift to lower temperatures."

[4] "The bimetallic phase of Pt-Ni seems to give rise to stable activity with high CO2 selectivity in selective oxidation of CO in H2-rich stream."

The literature provides some insights into how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence CO oxidation, but it does not directly address water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. For CO oxidation, the study shows that Pt catalysts promoted with various transition metals, particularly Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3, demonstrate high CO conversions across a wide range of reaction temperatures. The catalytic activity at low temperatures improved as the Ni/Pt molar ratio increased, which was associated with a shift in TPR peaks to lower temperatures. The bimetallic Pt-Ni phase appears to provide stable activity and high CO2 selectivity in the selective oxidation of CO in hydrogen-rich environments.

However, the literature does not provide information on UHV studies or their potential insights for correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. The document focuses on reactor studies and does not mention any UHV experiments or their limitations in studying Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions about the potential insights that future UHV studies might provide based on this specific literature.

该文献提供了一些关于Pt基双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化的见解，但并未直接涉及水气变换反应或甲烷转化。对于CO氧化，研究表明，用各种过渡金属促进的Pt催化剂，特别是Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3，在广泛的反应温度范围内表现出高CO转化率。随着Ni/Pt摩尔比的增加，低温下的催化活性得到改善，这与TPR峰向低温方向移动有关。Pt-Ni双金属相似乎在富氢环境中的CO选择性氧化过程中提供了稳定的活性和高CO2选择性。

然而，该文献没有提供关于UHV研究或其在将这些发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联方面的潜在见解的信息。该文档主要关注反应器研究，没有提及任何UHV实验或其在研究Pt基双金属表面方面的局限性。因此，我们无法根据这篇特定的文献得出关于未来UHV研究可能提供的潜在见解的结论。
