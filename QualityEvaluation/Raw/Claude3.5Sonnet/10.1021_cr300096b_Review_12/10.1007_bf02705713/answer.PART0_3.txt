[1] "Selective CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over supported Pt catalysts promoted with various transition metal compounds such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Zr."

[2] "Among them, Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 showed high CO conversions over wide reaction temperatures."

[3] "The catalytic activity at low temperatures increased with increasing the molar ratio of Ni/Pt. This accompanied the TPR peak shift to lower temperatures."

[4] "The bimetallic phase of Pt-Ni seems to give rise to stable activity with high CO2 selectivity in selective oxidation of CO in H2-rich stream."

The literature provides limited information on bimetallic catalysts, focusing primarily on Pt-Ni catalysts for selective CO oxidation in the presence of hydrogen. Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed high CO conversions across a wide temperature range. Increasing the Ni/Pt molar ratio improved catalytic activity at low temperatures, with an optimal ratio of 5. The bimetallic Pt-Ni phase demonstrated stable activity and high CO2 selectivity in CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich conditions.

The document does not discuss water gas shift reaction or methane conversions, nor does it mention UHV studies or model surfaces. Therefore, the question cannot be fully answered based solely on the provided literature. More comprehensive studies would be needed to address the broader aspects of the question, including UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and their correlation with supported catalysts in reactor studies.

该文献对双金属催化剂的信息有限，主要集中在氢气存在下选择性一氧化碳氧化的铂-镍催化剂上。Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂在广泛的温度范围内表现出高一氧化碳转化率。增加Ni/Pt摩尔比可以提高低温下的催化活性，最佳比例为5。在富氢条件下，双金属Pt-Ni相在一氧化碳氧化反应中表现出稳定的活性和高二氧化碳选择性。

文献没有讨论水气变换反应或甲烷转化，也没有提及超高真空研究或模型表面。因此，仅基于所提供的文献无法完全回答该问题。需要更全面的研究来解决问题的更广泛方面，包括铂基双金属表面的超高真空研究及其与反应器研究中负载型催化剂的相关性。
