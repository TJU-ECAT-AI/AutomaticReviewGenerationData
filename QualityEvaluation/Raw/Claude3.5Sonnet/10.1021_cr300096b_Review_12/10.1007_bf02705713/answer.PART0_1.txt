[1] "Selective CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over supported Pt catalysts promoted with various transition metal compounds such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Zr."

[2] "Among them, Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 showed high CO conversions over wide reaction temperatures."

[3] "The catalytic activity at low temperatures increased with increasing the molar ratio of Ni/Pt. This accompanied the TPR peak shift to lower temperatures."

[4] "The bimetallic phase of Pt-Ni seems to give rise to stable activity with high CO2 selectivity in selective oxidation of CO in H2-rich stream."

The literature provides some insights into how bimetallic Pt-based catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies, but it does not directly address water gas shift reactions or methane conversions. The study focused on selective CO oxidation in the presence of hydrogen using Pt catalysts promoted with various transition metals. 

Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed particularly high CO conversions across a wide temperature range. The catalytic activity at low temperatures increased as the Ni/Pt molar ratio increased, which was associated with a shift in the TPR peak to lower temperatures. The bimetallic Pt-Ni phase demonstrated stable activity and high CO2 selectivity for selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich conditions.

The document does not provide information on water gas shift reactions or methane conversions, nor does it discuss potential insights from future UHV studies or correlations with model surfaces. The study was conducted in reactor conditions rather than UHV environments, so it does not address the current limitations of UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed to explore the effects of bimetallic Pt-based catalysts on water gas shift reactions and methane conversions, as well as to investigate the potential insights that could be gained from UHV studies on these systems.

该文献提供了一些关于双金属Pt基催化剂如何影响CO氧化机理和效率的见解，但并未直接涉及水气变换反应或甲烷转化。该研究主要关注在氢气存在下使用各种过渡金属促进的Pt催化剂进行选择性CO氧化。

Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂在较宽的温度范围内显示出较高的CO转化率。随着Ni/Pt摩尔比的增加，低温下的催化活性增加，这与TPR峰向低温方向移动有关。双金属Pt-Ni相在富氢条件下对CO选择性氧化表现出稳定的活性和高CO2选择性。

文献中没有提供关于水气变换反应或甲烷转化的信息，也没有讨论未来超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供的见解或与模型表面的相关性。该研究是在反应器条件下进行的，而不是在UHV环境中，因此没有涉及当前UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的局限性。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要进行额外的研究，以探讨双金属Pt基催化剂对水气变换反应和甲烷转化的影响，以及调查在这些系统上进行UHV研究可能获得的潜在见解。
