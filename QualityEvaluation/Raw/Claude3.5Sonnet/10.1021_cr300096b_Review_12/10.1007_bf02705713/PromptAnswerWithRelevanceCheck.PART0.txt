[1] "Selective CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over supported Pt catalysts promoted with various transition metal compounds such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Zr."

[2] "Among them, Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 showed high CO conversions over wide reaction temperatures."

[3] "The catalytic activity at low temperatures increased with increasing the molar ratio of Ni/Pt. This accompanied the TPR peak shift to lower temperatures."

[4] "The bimetallic phase of Pt-Ni seems to give rise to stable activity with high CO2 selectivity in selective oxidation of CO in H2-rich stream."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provides some insights into how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence CO oxidation, but it does not directly address water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. For CO oxidation, the study shows that Pt catalysts promoted with various transition metals, particularly Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3, demonstrate high CO conversions across a wide range of reaction temperatures. The catalytic activity at low temperatures improved as the Ni/Pt molar ratio increased, which was associated with a shift in TPR peaks to lower temperatures. The bimetallic Pt-Ni phase appears to provide stable activity and high CO2 selectivity in the selective oxidation of CO in hydrogen-rich environments.

However, the literature does not provide information on UHV studies or their potential insights for correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. The document focuses on reactor studies and does not mention any UHV experiments or their limitations in studying Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions about the potential insights that future UHV studies might provide based on this specific literature.

该文献提供了一些关于Pt基双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化的见解，但并未直接涉及水气变换反应或甲烷转化。对于CO氧化，研究表明，用各种过渡金属促进的Pt催化剂，特别是Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3，在广泛的反应温度范围内表现出高CO转化率。随着Ni/Pt摩尔比的增加，低温下的催化活性得到改善，这与TPR峰向低温方向移动有关。Pt-Ni双金属相似乎在富氢环境中的CO选择性氧化过程中提供了稳定的活性和高CO2选择性。

然而，该文献没有提供关于UHV研究或其在将这些发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联方面的潜在见解的信息。该文档主要关注反应器研究，没有提及任何UHV实验或其在研究Pt基双金属表面方面的局限性。因此，我们无法根据这篇特定的文献得出关于未来UHV研究可能提供的潜在见解的结论。

该文献提供了一些关于双金属Pt基催化剂如何影响CO氧化机理和效率的见解，但并未直接涉及水气变换反应或甲烷转化。该研究主要关注在氢气存在下使用各种过渡金属促进的Pt催化剂进行选择性CO氧化。

Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂在较宽的温度范围内显示出较高的CO转化率。随着Ni/Pt摩尔比的增加，低温下的催化活性增加，这与TPR峰向低温方向移动有关。双金属Pt-Ni相在富氢条件下对CO选择性氧化表现出稳定的活性和高CO2选择性。

文献中没有提供关于水气变换反应或甲烷转化的信息，也没有讨论未来超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供的见解或与模型表面的相关性。该研究是在反应器条件下进行的，而不是在UHV环境中，因此没有涉及当前UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的局限性。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要进行额外的研究，以探讨双金属Pt基催化剂对水气变换反应和甲烷转化的影响，以及调查在这些系统上进行UHV研究可能获得的潜在见解。

文献提供了一些关于基于铂的双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化机制和效率的见解。具体来说，它讨论了在过量氢气存在下使用由各种过渡金属促进的负载型铂催化剂进行选择性CO氧化的研究。研究发现，Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂在广泛的反应温度范围内表现出高CO转化率。在低温下，随着Ni/Pt摩尔比的增加，催化活性增加，这与TPR峰向低温方向移动有关。双金属Pt-Ni相似乎在富氢气流中选择性氧化CO时提供了稳定的活性和高CO2选择性。

然而，该文献没有提供关于水气变换反应或甲烷转化的信息。它也没有讨论未来UHV研究的潜在见解或与模型表面和负载催化剂的相关性。该文档主要集中在富氢环境中的CO氧化，没有涉及当前UHV研究在基于铂的双金属表面上的局限性。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要进行额外的研究，以探讨基于铂的双金属催化剂对水气变换反应和甲烷转化的影响，以及UHV研究的潜在见解及其与反应器研究的相关性。

The literature provides limited information on bimetallic catalysts, focusing primarily on Pt-Ni catalysts for selective CO oxidation in the presence of hydrogen. Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed high CO conversions across a wide temperature range. Increasing the Ni/Pt molar ratio improved catalytic activity at low temperatures, with an optimal ratio of 5. The bimetallic Pt-Ni phase demonstrated stable activity and high CO2 selectivity in CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich conditions.

The document does not discuss water gas shift reaction or methane conversions, nor does it mention UHV studies or model surfaces. Therefore, the question cannot be fully answered based solely on the provided literature. More comprehensive studies would be needed to address the broader aspects of the question, including UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and their correlation with supported catalysts in reactor studies.

该文献对双金属催化剂的信息有限，主要集中在氢气存在下选择性一氧化碳氧化的铂-镍催化剂上。Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂在广泛的温度范围内表现出高一氧化碳转化率。增加Ni/Pt摩尔比可以提高低温下的催化活性，最佳比例为5。在富氢条件下，双金属Pt-Ni相在一氧化碳氧化反应中表现出稳定的活性和高二氧化碳选择性。

文献没有讨论水气变换反应或甲烷转化，也没有提及超高真空研究或模型表面。因此，仅基于所提供的文献无法完全回答该问题。需要更全面的研究来解决问题的更广泛方面，包括铂基双金属表面的超高真空研究及其与反应器研究中负载型催化剂的相关性。

The literature provides some insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, on CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies. Pt catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and promoted with various transition metals were studied for selective CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen. Among these, Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 demonstrated high CO conversion over a wide temperature range. The catalytic activity at low temperatures improved as the Ni/Pt molar ratio increased, coinciding with a shift of the TPR peak to lower temperatures. The bimetallic Pt-Ni phase appeared to provide stable activity with high CO2 selectivity for selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich conditions.

However, the literature does not provide information on water gas shift reactions or methane conversions. It also does not discuss UHV studies or their potential insights. The document focuses solely on CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich environments using supported Pt catalysts, particularly Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts.

To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed on the effects of bimetallic catalysts on water gas shift reactions and methane conversions, as well as the potential insights from UHV studies on model surfaces and supported catalysts.

该文献提供了一些关于双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，对CO氧化机理和效率影响的见解。研究了在过量氢气存在下，γ-Al2O3负载的Pt催化剂与各种过渡金属促进剂对CO选择性氧化的影响。其中，Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3在广泛的温度范围内表现出高CO转化率。随着Ni/Pt摩尔比的增加，低温下的催化活性提高，同时TPR峰向低温方向移动。Pt-Ni双金属相似乎在富氢条件下的CO选择性氧化中提供了稳定的活性和高CO2选择性。

然而，该文献未提供关于水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化的信息。它也没有讨论UHV研究或其潜在的见解。文档仅关注于使用负载型Pt催化剂，特别是Pt-Ni双金属催化剂，在富氢环境中进行CO氧化。

要全面回答这个问题，需要对双金属催化剂在水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化中的作用，以及UHV研究对模型表面和负载催化剂的潜在见解进行额外研究。当前文献并未涉及这些方面，也没有讨论UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的局限性。
