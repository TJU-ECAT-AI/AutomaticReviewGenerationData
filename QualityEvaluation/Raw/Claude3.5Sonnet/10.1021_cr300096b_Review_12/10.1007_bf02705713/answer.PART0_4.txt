[1] "Selective CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over supported Pt catalysts promoted with various transition metal compounds such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Zr."

[2] "Among them, Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 showed high CO conversions over wide reaction temperatures."

[3] "The catalytic activity at low temperatures increased with increasing the molar ratio of Ni/Pt. This accompanied the TPR peak shift to lower temperatures."

[4] "The bimetallic phase of Pt-Ni seems to give rise to stable activity with high CO2 selectivity in selective oxidation of CO in H2-rich stream."

The literature provides some insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, on CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies. Pt catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and promoted with various transition metals were studied for selective CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen. Among these, Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 demonstrated high CO conversion over a wide temperature range. The catalytic activity at low temperatures improved as the Ni/Pt molar ratio increased, coinciding with a shift of the TPR peak to lower temperatures. The bimetallic Pt-Ni phase appeared to provide stable activity with high CO2 selectivity for selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich conditions.

However, the literature does not provide information on water gas shift reactions or methane conversions. It also does not discuss UHV studies or their potential insights. The document focuses solely on CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich environments using supported Pt catalysts, particularly Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts.

To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed on the effects of bimetallic catalysts on water gas shift reactions and methane conversions, as well as the potential insights from UHV studies on model surfaces and supported catalysts. The current literature does not address these aspects or the limitations of UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

该文献提供了一些关于双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，对CO氧化机理和效率影响的见解。研究了在过量氢气存在下，γ-Al2O3负载的Pt催化剂与各种过渡金属促进剂对CO选择性氧化的影响。其中，Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3在广泛的温度范围内表现出高CO转化率。随着Ni/Pt摩尔比的增加，低温下的催化活性提高，同时TPR峰向低温方向移动。Pt-Ni双金属相似乎在富氢条件下的CO选择性氧化中提供了稳定的活性和高CO2选择性。

然而，该文献未提供关于水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化的信息。它也没有讨论UHV研究或其潜在的见解。文档仅关注于使用负载型Pt催化剂，特别是Pt-Ni双金属催化剂，在富氢环境中进行CO氧化。

要全面回答这个问题，需要对双金属催化剂在水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化中的作用，以及UHV研究对模型表面和负载催化剂的潜在见解进行额外研究。当前文献并未涉及这些方面，也没有讨论UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的局限性。
