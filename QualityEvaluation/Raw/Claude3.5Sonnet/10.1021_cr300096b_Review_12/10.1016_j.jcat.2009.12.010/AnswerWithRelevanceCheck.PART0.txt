          [1] "Chen et al. [11] studied the promoting effect of Pt, Pd and Rh in Ni0.03Mg0.97O catalysts for CO2-reforming. They found that the noble metal addition improves the catalyst stability and reducibility."

[2] "Pawelec et al. [3] reported that, in bimetallic PtNi catalysts supported on ZSM-5 for DRM, the presence of Pt (0.5%) leads to the formation of small and reducible nano-sized NiO particles. They also observed an improvement in the catalytic activity and stability, which was attributed to an increase in the nickel metallic dispersion caused by intimate contact between nickel and platinum."

[3] "Activity tests demonstrated that Pt presence and the use of the nanofibrous support in Ni catalysts improve CH4 and CO2 conversions, reaching values close to equilibrium. Moreover, Pt inhibits coke deposition and reduces the operation temperature."

[4] "From stability tests it can be concluded that Pt enhances the stability of Ni-based catalysts for DRM."

[5] "The addition of Pt modifies the Ni ensembles, by a synergic effect, varying the dissociative adsorption capacity of methane and consequently reducing the net carbon formation. This fact together with the ability of Pt to remove carbon by CO2 could produce differences between the rates of carbon deposition and gasification by CO2; at higher Pt content, higher carbon gasification and less net carbon formation."

[6] "The carbon formation in the DRM occurs via two reactions: methane decomposition and CO disproportionation reactions. Methane decomposition is a structure-sensitivity reaction, which can be inhibited by controlling the catalyst surface structure. Apparently, the Pt incorporation not only conditions the Ni0 particles size, but also avoids the Ni encapsulation by carbon."

          Bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversions in reactor studies, particularly for CO2 reforming of methane (DRM). The main effects include:

1. Improved catalyst stability and reducibility.
2. Formation of small, reducible nano-sized NiO particles, increasing nickel metallic dispersion.
3. Enhanced CH4 and CO2 conversions, approaching equilibrium values.
4. Inhibition of coke deposition and reduction of operation temperature.
5. Modification of Ni ensembles, altering methane's dissociative adsorption capacity and reducing net carbon formation.
6. Higher Pt content leads to increased carbon gasification by CO2 and less net carbon formation.
7. Prevention of Ni encapsulation by carbon.

The literature does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into:

1. Atomic-level Pt-Ni interactions.
2. Surface chemistry of carbon formation and removal on bimetallic surfaces.
3. Effect of reaction conditions on surface structure and composition.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces include difficulties in creating well-defined surfaces and replicating complex environments of supported catalysts. Overcoming these challenges could help correlate findings between model surfaces and practical supported catalysts.

          双金属Pt-Ni催化剂显著影响反应器研究中甲烷转化的机理和效率，尤其是对于甲烷的CO2重整（DRM）。主要影响包括：

1. 提高催化剂稳定性和可还原性。
2. 形成小的、可还原的纳米级NiO颗粒，增加镍金属分散度。
3. 提高CH4和CO2的转化率，接近平衡值。
4. 抑制积炭沉积并降低操作温度。
5. 修改Ni集合体，改变甲烷的解离吸附能力，减少净碳形成。
6. 更高的Pt含量导致CO2对碳的气化作用增强，净碳形成减少。
7. 防止Ni被碳包覆。

文献没有直接涉及CO氧化或水气变换反应。未来的UHV研究可能会提供以下方面的见解：

1. 原子级Pt-Ni相互作用。
2. 双金属表面上碳形成和去除的表面化学。
3. 反应条件对表面结构和组成的影响。

然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究中存在一些限制，包括创建明确定义的表面和复制支持催化剂复杂环境的困难。克服这些挑战可能有助于将模型表面和实际支持催化剂的研究结果相关联。
