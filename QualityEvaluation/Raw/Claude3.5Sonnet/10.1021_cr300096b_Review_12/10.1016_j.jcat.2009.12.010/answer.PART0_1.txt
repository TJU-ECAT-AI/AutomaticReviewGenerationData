[1] "Chen et al. [11] studied the promoting effect of Pt, Pd and Rh in Ni0.03Mg0.97O catalysts for CO2-reforming. They found that the noble metal addition improves the catalyst stability and reducibility."

[2] "Tomishige et al. [14] observed that the catalytic activity increased, in autothermal reforming of methane, when small amounts of Pt were incorporated to Ni/Al2O3 catalysts."

[3] "Pawelec et al. [3] reported that, in bimetallic PtNi catalysts supported on ZSM-5 for DRM, the presence of Pt (0.5%) leads to the formation of small and reducible nano-sized NiO particles. They also observed an improvement in the catalytic activity and stability, which was attributed to an increase in the nickel metallic dispersion caused by intimate contact between nickel and platinum."

[4] "Activity tests demonstrated that Pt presence and the use of the nanofibrous support in Ni catalysts improve CH4 and CO2 conversions, reaching values close to equilibrium. Moreover, Pt inhibits coke deposition and reduces the operation temperature."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The literature indicates that adding Pt to Ni-based catalysts improves catalyst stability, reducibility, and activity in CO2 reforming and autothermal reforming of methane. 

Specifically, Pt addition leads to the formation of small, reducible NiO particles and increases nickel metallic dispersion. This results in improved CH4 and CO2 conversions, with values approaching equilibrium. Pt also inhibits coke deposition and allows for operation at lower temperatures, enhancing the overall stability of Ni-based catalysts for dry reforming of methane (DRM).

While the current literature provides valuable insights into reactor studies, future UHV studies could potentially bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts. Such studies could provide atomic-level understanding of the interactions between Pt and Ni, the formation of active sites, and the mechanisms of coke inhibition. They could also elucidate the role of support materials in stabilizing metal particles and promoting activity.

However, conducting UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces presents challenges, particularly in replicating the complex environments of real catalytic systems. Overcoming these limitations could provide crucial correlations between idealized model systems and practical supported catalysts, offering deeper insights into the fundamental processes governing catalytic performance in these important reactions.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，显著影响了反应器研究中CO氧化、水气变换反应和甲烷转化的机理和效率。文献表明，向基于Ni的催化剂中添加Pt可以提高催化剂在CO2重整和甲烷自热重整中的稳定性、可还原性和活性。

具体而言，添加Pt导致形成小的、可还原的NiO粒子，并增加镍金属分散度。这导致CH4和CO2转化率提高，接近平衡值。Pt还抑制积炭沉积，允许在较低温度下操作，从而提高了基于Ni的催化剂在甲烷干重整（DRM）中的整体稳定性。

虽然当前文献为反应器研究提供了宝贵的见解，但未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会弥合模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距。这些研究可以提供Pt和Ni之间相互作用、活性位点形成以及焦炭抑制机制的原子级理解。它们还可以阐明支撑材料在稳定金属粒子和促进活性方面的作用。

然而，在基于Pt的双金属表面上进行UHV研究存在挑战，特别是在复制真实催化系统的复杂环境方面。克服这些限制可以提供理想化模型系统和实际负载催化剂之间的关键相关性，为这些重要反应中的催化性能提供更深入的基本过程理解。
