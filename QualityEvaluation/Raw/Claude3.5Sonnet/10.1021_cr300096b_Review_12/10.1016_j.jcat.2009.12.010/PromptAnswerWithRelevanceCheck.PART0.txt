[1] "Additionally, Pt addition promoted the formation of NiO, instead of NiAl2O4, and facilitated its reduction to Ni0 during the catalysts activation. It was also observed that the average size of Ni0 particles decreased with increasing Pt content."

[2] "Activity tests demonstrated that Pt presence and the use of the nanofibrous support in Ni catalysts improve CH4 and CO2 conversions, reaching values close to equilibrium. Moreover, Pt inhibits coke deposition and reduces the operation temperature."

[3] "From stability tests it can be concluded that Pt enhances the stability of Ni-based catalysts for DRM."

[4] "The addition of Pt modifies the Ni ensembles, by a synergic effect, varying the dissociative adsorption capacity of methane and consequently reducing the net carbon formation. This fact together with the ability of Pt to remove carbon by CO2 could produce differences between the rates of carbon deposition and gasification by CO2; at higher Pt content, higher carbon gasification and less net carbon formation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provides several insights into how bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts influence mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversion in dry reforming of methane (DRM) reactor studies:

1. Pt addition promotes the formation of NiO instead of NiAl2O4, facilitates its reduction to Ni0, and decreases the average size of Ni0 particles.

2. The presence of Pt improves CH4 and CO2 conversions, bringing them closer to equilibrium values. It also inhibits coke deposition and reduces the operation temperature.

3. Pt enhances the stability of Ni-based catalysts for DRM.

4. Pt modifies Ni ensembles, affecting methane's dissociative adsorption capacity and reducing net carbon formation. Higher Pt content leads to increased carbon gasification and less net carbon formation.

The literature does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions, nor does it discuss potential insights from UHV studies. To fully answer the question, additional research focusing on these specific reactions and UHV studies would be necessary. Such studies could potentially provide atomic-level insights into the synergistic effects observed in reactor studies, helping to correlate findings between model surfaces and supported catalysts.

文献为铂-镍双金属催化剂如何影响甲烷干重整(DRM)反应器研究中的甲烷转化机理和效率提供了几点见解：

1. 铂的添加促进了NiO的形成而非NiAl2O4，促进了其还原为Ni0，并减小了Ni0颗粒的平均尺寸。

2. 铂的存在提高了CH4和CO2的转化率，使其接近平衡值。它还抑制了积碳沉积并降低了操作温度。

3. 铂提高了镍基催化剂在DRM反应中的稳定性。

4. 铂改变了镍的集合体，影响甲烷的解离吸附能力，减少了净碳形成。更高的铂含量导致更多的碳气化和更少的净碳形成。

文献并未直接涉及CO氧化或水煤气变换反应，也没有讨论超高真空(UHV)研究可能提供的见解。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行额外的研究，重点关注这些特定反应和UHV研究。这些研究可能会提供反应器研究中观察到的协同效应的原子级见解，有助于将模型表面和负载催化剂的研究结果相关联。

[1] "Chen et al. [11] studied the promoting effect of Pt, Pd and Rh in Ni0.03Mg0.97O catalysts for CO2-reforming. They found that the noble metal addition improves the catalyst stability and reducibility."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. The literature indicates that adding Pt to Ni-based catalysts improves catalyst stability, reducibility, and activity in CO2 reforming and autothermal reforming of methane. 

Specifically, Pt addition leads to the formation of small, reducible NiO particles and increases nickel metallic dispersion. This results in improved CH4 and CO2 conversions, with values approaching equilibrium. Pt also inhibits coke deposition and allows for operation at lower temperatures, enhancing the overall stability of Ni-based catalysts for dry reforming of methane (DRM).

While the current literature provides valuable insights into reactor studies, future UHV studies could potentially bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts. Such studies could provide atomic-level understanding of the interactions between Pt and Ni, the formation of active sites, and the mechanisms of coke inhibition. They could also elucidate the role of support materials in stabilizing metal particles and promoting activity.

However, conducting UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces presents challenges, particularly in replicating the complex environments of real catalytic systems. Overcoming these limitations could provide crucial correlations between idealized model systems and practical supported catalysts, offering deeper insights into the fundamental processes governing catalytic performance in these important reactions.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，显著影响了反应器研究中CO氧化、水气变换反应和甲烷转化的机理和效率。文献表明，向基于Ni的催化剂中添加Pt可以提高催化剂在CO2重整和甲烷自热重整中的稳定性、可还原性和活性。

具体而言，添加Pt导致形成小的、可还原的NiO粒子，并增加镍金属分散度。这导致CH4和CO2转化率提高，接近平衡值。Pt还抑制积炭沉积，允许在较低温度下操作，从而提高了基于Ni的催化剂在甲烷干重整（DRM）中的整体稳定性。

虽然当前文献为反应器研究提供了宝贵的见解，但未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会弥合模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距。这些研究可以提供Pt和Ni之间相互作用、活性位点形成以及焦炭抑制机制的原子级理解。它们还可以阐明支撑材料在稳定金属粒子和促进活性方面的作用。

然而，在基于Pt的双金属表面上进行UHV研究存在挑战，特别是在复制真实催化系统的复杂环境方面。克服这些限制可以提供理想化模型系统和实际负载催化剂之间的关键相关性，为这些重要反应中的催化性能提供更深入的基本过程理解。

[4] "Results from XRD, XPS, Raman and elemental analysis indicate that the net carbon formation and the characteristics of the carbon formed can be related to the Ni particle size and dispersion but also to the Ni0/NiO and Ni0/NiAl2O4 ratios, parameters that are conditioned by the use of the nanofibrous support as well as the addition of Pt."

[5] "The carbon formation in the DRM occurs via two reactions: methane decomposition and CO disproportionation reactions. Methane decomposition is a structure-sensitivity reaction, which can be inhibited by controlling the catalyst surface structure.

1. They improve catalyst stability and reducibility.

2. They lead to the formation of small, reducible nano-sized NiO particles, which increases nickel metallic dispersion.

4. The surface chemistry of carbon formation and removal on bimetallic surfaces.

5. The effect of various reaction conditions on the surface structure and composition of bimetallic catalysts.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may include difficulties in creating and maintaining well-defined bimetallic surfaces under UHV conditions, and challenges in replicating the complex environment of supported catalysts. Overcoming these limitations could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and real catalysts, providing valuable insights for catalyst design and optimization.
