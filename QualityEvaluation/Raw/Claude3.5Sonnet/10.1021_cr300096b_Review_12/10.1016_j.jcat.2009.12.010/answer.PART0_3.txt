[1] "Nanostructured Pt- and Ni-based catalysts for CO2-reforming of methane"

[2] "It was also observed that the average size of Ni0 particles decreased with increasing Pt content."

[3] "Activity tests demonstrated that Pt presence and the use of the nanofibrous support in Ni catalysts improve CH4 and CO2 conversions, reaching values close to equilibrium. Moreover, Pt inhibits coke deposition and reduces the operation temperature."

[4] "From stability tests it can be concluded that Pt enhances the stability of Ni-based catalysts for DRM."

[5] "Besides, it is worth noticing that at low temperatures (400600 C) the H2/CO ratios decrease with the Pt load. However, at 600700 C the H2/CO ratios obtained with the catalysts with high Pt content show a trend toward increasing with the temperature, while the H2/CO ratios registered with the catalysts with low Pt load tend to decrease after 600 C."

[6] "The carbon formation in the DRM occurs via two reactions: methane decomposition and CO disproportionation reactions. Methane decomposition is a structure-sensitivity reaction, which can be inhibited by controlling the catalyst surface structure. Apparently, the Pt incorporation not only conditions the Ni0 particles size, but also avoids the Ni encapsulation by carbon."

The bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts influence CO2 reforming of methane (DRM) in several ways:

1. They improve CH4 and CO2 conversions, bringing them closer to equilibrium values.

2. Pt inhibits coke deposition on the catalyst surface and allows for lower operating temperatures.

3. The addition of Pt enhances the stability of Ni-based catalysts for DRM.

4. Pt affects the H2/CO ratio produced, with different trends observed at low (400-600°C) and high (600-700°C) temperature ranges.

5. Pt incorporation conditions the Ni0 particle size and prevents Ni encapsulation by carbon.

6. The presence of Pt modifies the mechanisms of carbon formation, influencing both methane decomposition and CO disproportionation reactions.

While this study provides insights into catalyst behavior under reactor conditions, future UHV studies could potentially:

1. Investigate the surface interactions between Pt and Ni at the atomic level.
2. Examine the adsorption and reaction mechanisms of CH4 and CO2 on model Pt-Ni surfaces.
3. Study the formation and characteristics of carbon deposits on well-defined Pt-Ni surfaces.
4. Correlate the surface structure and composition with reactivity and selectivity.

These UHV studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing a more fundamental understanding of the observed reactor behavior. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may pose challenges in directly correlating these findings.

双金属Pt-Ni催化剂以几种方式影响甲烷的CO2重整（DRM）：

1. 它们提高了CH4和CO2的转化率，使其更接近平衡值。

2. Pt抑制了催化剂表面的积炭沉积，并允许更低的操作温度。

3. 添加Pt提高了基于Ni的催化剂在DRM中的稳定性。

4. Pt影响所产生的H2/CO比率，在低温（400-600°C）和高温（600-700°C）范围内观察到不同的趋势。

5. Pt的引入调节了Ni0粒子的大小，并防止了Ni被碳包覆。

6. Pt的存在改变了碳形成的机制，影响了甲烷分解和CO歧化反应。

虽然这项研究提供了催化剂在反应器条件下行为的见解，但未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可能会：

1. 在原子水平上研究Pt和Ni之间的表面相互作用。
2. 检查CH4和CO2在模型Pt-Ni表面上的吸附和反应机制。
3. 研究在定义明确的Pt-Ni表面上碳沉积的形成和特性。
4. 将表面结构和组成与反应性和选择性相关联。

这些UHV研究可能有助于弥合模型表面和负载型催化剂之间的差距，为观察到的反应器行为提供更基础的理解。然而，当前在Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究方面的限制可能会给直接关联这些发现带来挑战。
