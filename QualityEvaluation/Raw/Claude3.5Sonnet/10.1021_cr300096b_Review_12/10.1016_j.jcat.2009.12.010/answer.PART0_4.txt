[1] "Pt addition promoted the formation of NiO, instead of NiAl2O4, and facilitated its reduction to Ni0 during the catalysts activation. It was also observed that the average size of Ni0 particles decreased with increasing Pt content."

[2] "Activity tests demonstrated that Pt presence and the use of the nanofibrous support in Ni catalysts improve CH4 and CO2 conversions, reaching values close to equilibrium. Moreover, Pt inhibits coke deposition and reduces the operation temperature."

[3] "The addition of Pt modifies the Ni ensembles, by a synergic effect, varying the dissociative adsorption capacity of methane and consequently reducing the net carbon formation. This fact together with the ability of Pt to remove carbon by CO2 could produce differences between the rates of carbon deposition and gasification by CO2; at higher Pt content, higher carbon gasification and less net carbon formation."

[4] "For the catalyst with the lowest content of Pt (Pt/Ni = 1/100) the activity is slightly improved and the carbon formation reduced with respect to the 4Ni/Al2O3(N) catalysts. Moreover, for the catalysts with the highest content of Pt (Pt/Ni = 1/10) the conversions values are higher than those of the Pt/Al2O3(N) catalyst and the net carbon formation is almost the same."

Bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts influence CO2 reforming of methane (DRM) in several ways:

1. They improve CH4 and CO2 conversions, bringing them closer to equilibrium values.

2. Pt addition reduces coke deposition and lowers the operation temperature.

3. Pt modifies Ni ensembles, altering methane's dissociative adsorption capacity and reducing net carbon formation.

4. Higher Pt content leads to increased carbon gasification by CO2 and less net carbon formation.

5. Even low Pt content (Pt/Ni = 1/100) improves activity and reduces carbon formation compared to Ni-only catalysts.

6. High Pt content (Pt/Ni = 1/10) results in higher conversion values than Pt-only catalysts with similar low net carbon formation.

These findings from reactor studies provide insights into the synergistic effects of Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these results with model surfaces and supported catalysts by:

1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of Pt-Ni bimetallic surfaces.
2. Studying the adsorption and dissociation of CH4 and CO2 on these surfaces.
3. Examining the formation and removal of carbon species at the atomic level.
4. Exploring the effects of different Pt/Ni ratios on surface reactivity.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may pose challenges in directly correlating reactor studies with model surfaces. Overcoming these limitations could provide valuable atomic-level insights into the mechanisms underlying the improved performance of Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts in DRM.

Pt-Ni双金属催化剂以几种方式影响甲烷的CO2重整(DRM)：

1. 它们提高了CH4和CO2的转化率，使其接近平衡值。

2. 添加Pt减少了积碳沉积并降低了操作温度。

3. Pt修改了Ni集合体，改变了甲烷的解离吸附能力，减少了净碳形成。

4. 更高的Pt含量导致CO2对碳的气化作用增强，净碳形成减少。

5. 即使是低Pt含量(Pt/Ni = 1/100)也比单一Ni催化剂提高了活性并减少了碳形成。

6. 高Pt含量(Pt/Ni = 1/10)比单一Pt催化剂具有更高的转化率，同时保持类似的低净碳形成。

这些反应器研究的发现为Pt-Ni双金属催化剂的协同作用提供了洞见。未来的UHV研究可能通过以下方式将这些结果与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联：

1. 研究Pt-Ni双金属表面的表面结构和组成。
2. 研究CH4和CO2在这些表面上的吸附和解离。
3. 在原子水平上检查碳物种的形成和去除。
4. 探索不同Pt/Ni比率对表面反应活性的影响。

然而，当前UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的限制可能会给直接将反应器研究与模型表面相关联带来挑战。克服这些限制可能会为理解Pt-Ni双金属催化剂在DRM中性能改善的机理提供宝贵的原子水平洞察。
