[1] "Additionally, Pt addition promoted the formation of NiO, instead of NiAl2O4, and facilitated its reduction to Ni0 during the catalysts activation. It was also observed that the average size of Ni0 particles decreased with increasing Pt content."

[2] "Activity tests demonstrated that Pt presence and the use of the nanofibrous support in Ni catalysts improve CH4 and CO2 conversions, reaching values close to equilibrium. Moreover, Pt inhibits coke deposition and reduces the operation temperature."

[3] "From stability tests it can be concluded that Pt enhances the stability of Ni-based catalysts for DRM."

[4] "The addition of Pt modifies the Ni ensembles, by a synergic effect, varying the dissociative adsorption capacity of methane and consequently reducing the net carbon formation. This fact together with the ability of Pt to remove carbon by CO2 could produce differences between the rates of carbon deposition and gasification by CO2; at higher Pt content, higher carbon gasification and less net carbon formation."

The literature provides several insights into how bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts influence mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversion in dry reforming of methane (DRM) reactor studies:

1. Pt addition promotes the formation of NiO instead of NiAl2O4, facilitates its reduction to Ni0, and decreases the average size of Ni0 particles.

2. The presence of Pt improves CH4 and CO2 conversions, bringing them closer to equilibrium values. It also inhibits coke deposition and reduces the operation temperature.

3. Pt enhances the stability of Ni-based catalysts for DRM.

4. Pt modifies Ni ensembles, affecting methane's dissociative adsorption capacity and reducing net carbon formation. Higher Pt content leads to increased carbon gasification and less net carbon formation.

The literature does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions, nor does it discuss potential insights from UHV studies. To fully answer the question, additional research focusing on these specific reactions and UHV studies would be necessary. Such studies could potentially provide atomic-level insights into the synergistic effects observed in reactor studies, helping to correlate findings between model surfaces and supported catalysts.

文献为铂-镍双金属催化剂如何影响甲烷干重整(DRM)反应器研究中的甲烷转化机理和效率提供了几点见解：

1. 铂的添加促进了NiO的形成而非NiAl2O4，促进了其还原为Ni0，并减小了Ni0颗粒的平均尺寸。

2. 铂的存在提高了CH4和CO2的转化率，使其接近平衡值。它还抑制了积碳沉积并降低了操作温度。

3. 铂提高了镍基催化剂在DRM反应中的稳定性。

4. 铂改变了镍的集合体，影响甲烷的解离吸附能力，减少了净碳形成。更高的铂含量导致更多的碳气化和更少的净碳形成。

文献并未直接涉及CO氧化或水煤气变换反应，也没有讨论超高真空(UHV)研究可能提供的见解。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行额外的研究，重点关注这些特定反应和UHV研究。这些研究可能会提供反应器研究中观察到的协同效应的原子级见解，有助于将模型表面和负载催化剂的研究结果相关联。
