[1] "Pt-based intermetallic compounds (IMCs) supported on silica were studied as a catalyst for the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess hydrogen to obtain the active catalyst at low temperatures."

[2] "Pt3Co/SiO2 and PtCu/SiO2 were more active than Pt/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 in the temperature range of 373453 K."

[3] "Kinetic studies indicated that Co and Cu atoms in IMCs also adsorb oxygen. This improved oxygen adsorption likely resulted in the high PROX activity at low temperatures."

[4] "In the case of Pt3Co/SiO2, the reaction order with respect to P(O2) was positive both with and without hydrogen. CO adsorption was stronger than O2 adsorption irrespective of the presence or absence of hydrogen. Oxygen was adsorbed mainly on Co, because the IR spectra did not indicate CO adsorption on Co."

[5] "In the case of PtCu/SiO2, however, the reaction order with respect to P(O2) was negative in the presence of hydrogen (Fig. 15 a) but positive without hydrogen. As a result, the adsorptions of CO and O2 were almost comparable in the presence of hydrogen. Hydrogen enhanced the adsorption of O2."

Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt3Co and PtCu supported on silica, show higher activity for CO oxidation in the preferential oxidation (PROX) reaction compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The mechanisms and efficiencies are influenced by several factors:

1. Improved oxygen adsorption: The Co and Cu atoms in the intermetallic compounds (IMCs) adsorb oxygen, leading to higher PROX activity at low temperatures.

2. Modified CO adsorption: The formation of IMCs weakens CO adsorption compared to pure Pt surfaces, allowing for more efficient oxidation.

3. Different reaction mechanisms: On Pt3Co, oxygen is mainly adsorbed on Co atoms, while CO adsorbs on Pt. The reaction likely proceeds through a dual-site mechanism. On PtCu, the presence of hydrogen enhances O2 adsorption, leading to comparable adsorption strengths for CO and O2.

4. Hydrogen effects: Hydrogen addition has different impacts on Pt3Co and PtCu catalysts. For PtCu, hydrogen significantly enhances activity by promoting O2 adsorption.

The literature does not provide information on water gas shift reaction or methane conversion mechanisms for these catalysts.

Future UHV studies could provide insights by:

1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions.
2. Studying the adsorption and reaction of individual gases (CO, O2, H2) on model surfaces to correlate with supported catalyst behavior.
3. Examining the effect of support materials on the catalytic properties of Pt-based bimetallic particles.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may include difficulties in creating well-defined bimetallic surfaces and maintaining the intermetallic structure under UHV conditions.

基于铂的双金属催化剂，特别是负载在二氧化硅上的Pt3Co和PtCu，在优先氧化（PROX）反应中表现出比单金属铂催化剂更高的CO氧化活性。其机理和效率受几个因素影响：

1. 改善的氧气吸附：金属间化合物（IMCs）中的钴和铜原子吸附氧气，导致在低温下具有更高的PROX活性。

2. 改变的CO吸附：IMCs的形成与纯铂表面相比减弱了CO的吸附，从而允许更有效的氧化。

3. 不同的反应机理：在Pt3Co上，氧气主要吸附在钴原子上，而CO吸附在铂上。反应可能通过双位点机理进行。在PtCu上，氢气的存在增强了O2的吸附，导致CO和O2的吸附强度相当。

4. 氢气效应：氢气的添加对Pt3Co和PtCu催化剂有不同的影响。对于PtCu，氢气通过促进O2吸附显著提高活性。

文献没有提供这些催化剂在水气变换反应或甲烷转化机理方面的信息。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可以通过以下方式提供见解：

1. 研究反应条件下基于铂的双金属表面的表面结构和组成。
2. 研究单个气体（CO、O2、H2）在模型表面上的吸附和反应，以与负载催化剂的行为进行对比。
3. 研究载体材料对基于铂的双金属颗粒催化性能的影响。

然而，目前在基于铂的双金属表面的UHV研究中存在一些限制，可能包括创建明确定义的双金属表面的困难，以及在UHV条件下维持金属间化合物结构的挑战。
