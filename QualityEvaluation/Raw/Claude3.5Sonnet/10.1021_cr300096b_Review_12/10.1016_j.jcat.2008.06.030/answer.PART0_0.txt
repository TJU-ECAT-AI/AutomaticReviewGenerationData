[1] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, in which Pt and the other element can have IMC phases without forming the wide-range solid solution phases, have been studied for the PROX reaction."

[2] "Kinetic studies indicated that Co and Cu atoms in IMCs also adsorb oxygen. This improved oxygen adsorption likely resulted in the high PROX activity at low temperatures."

[3] "The reaction proceeded through the LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism, as has been proposed on PtFe/mordenite"

[4] "On PtCu/SiO2, however, CO conversion increased by 30% with the addition of hydrogen and even further by the addition of water. The enhancing effect of hydrogen reflected the contribution of water produced by the oxidation of hydrogen during the PROX reaction."

Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly intermetallic compounds (IMCs), significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation in preferential oxidation (PROX) reactions. These catalysts demonstrate higher activity at low temperatures compared to pure Pt catalysts, likely due to improved oxygen adsorption on the second metal component.

The reaction mechanism on these bimetallic surfaces appears to follow a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, differing from the Rideal mechanism observed on pure Pt surfaces. This change in mechanism contributes to the enhanced catalytic activity.

For PtCu catalysts, the presence of hydrogen and water significantly enhances CO conversion, suggesting a complex interplay between reactants and the bimetallic surface. This effect is not observed to the same extent on other catalysts like Pt3Co.

The literature does not provide direct information on water gas shift reactions or methane conversions for these bimetallic catalysts. Similarly, it does not discuss potential insights from UHV studies or current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide valuable insights into the surface chemistry of these bimetallic catalysts, helping to correlate the observed reactor performance with fundamental surface processes. Such studies could elucidate the specific roles of each metal in the catalytic process, the nature of active sites, and the influence of surface structure on reactivity.

基于铂的双金属催化剂，特别是金属间化合物（IMCs），显著影响了CO在优先氧化（PROX）反应中的氧化机理和效率。与纯铂催化剂相比，这些催化剂在低温下表现出更高的活性，这可能是由于第二种金属组分改善了氧气吸附。

这些双金属表面上的反应机理似乎遵循Langmuir-Hinshelwood模型，这与纯铂表面上观察到的Rideal机理不同。这种机理的变化促进了催化活性的提高。

对于PtCu催化剂，氢气和水的存在显著增强了CO转化，这表明反应物与双金属表面之间存在复杂的相互作用。这种效应在其他催化剂（如Pt3Co）上并未观察到相同程度的影响。

文献没有直接提供这些双金属催化剂在水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化方面的信息。同样，也没有讨论超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供的见解或当前UHV研究在铂基双金属表面上的限制。

未来的UHV研究可能会为这些双金属催化剂的表面化学提供宝贵的见解，有助于将观察到的反应器性能与基本表面过程相关联。这些研究可以阐明每种金属在催化过程中的具体作用、活性位点的性质以及表面结构对反应活性的影响。
