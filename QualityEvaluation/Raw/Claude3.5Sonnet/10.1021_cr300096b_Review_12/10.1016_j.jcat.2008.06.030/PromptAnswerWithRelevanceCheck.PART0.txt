[1] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, in which Pt and the other element can have IMC phases without forming the wide-range solid solution phases, have been studied for the PROX reaction."

[2] "Kinetic studies indicated that Co and Cu atoms in IMCs also adsorb oxygen. This improved oxygen adsorption likely resulted in the high PROX activity at low temperatures."

[3] "The reaction proceeded through the LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism, as has been proposed on PtFe/mordenite"

[4] "On PtCu/SiO2, however, CO conversion increased by 30% with the addition of hydrogen and even further by the addition of water. The enhancing effect of hydrogen reflected the contribution of water produced by the oxidation of hydrogen during the PROX reaction."

Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly intermetallic compounds (IMCs), significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation in preferential oxidation (PROX) reactions. These catalysts demonstrate higher activity at low temperatures compared to pure Pt catalysts, likely due to improved oxygen adsorption on the second metal component.

The reaction mechanism on these bimetallic surfaces appears to follow a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, differing from the Rideal mechanism observed on pure Pt surfaces. This change in mechanism contributes to the enhanced catalytic activity.

For PtCu catalysts, the presence of hydrogen and water significantly enhances CO conversion, suggesting a complex interplay between reactants and the bimetallic surface. This effect is not observed to the same extent on other catalysts like Pt3Co.

The literature does not provide direct information on water gas shift reactions or methane conversions for these bimetallic catalysts. Similarly, it does not discuss potential insights from UHV studies or current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide valuable insights into the surface chemistry of these bimetallic catalysts, helping to correlate the observed reactor performance with fundamental surface processes. Such studies could elucidate the specific roles of each metal in the catalytic process, the nature of active sites, and the influence of surface structure on reactivity.

基于铂的双金属催化剂，特别是金属间化合物（IMCs），显著影响了CO在优先氧化（PROX）反应中的氧化机理和效率。与纯铂催化剂相比，这些催化剂在低温下表现出更高的活性，这可能是由于第二种金属组分改善了氧气吸附。

这些双金属表面上的反应机理似乎遵循Langmuir-Hinshelwood模型，这与纯铂表面上观察到的Rideal机理不同。这种机理的变化促进了催化活性的提高。

对于PtCu催化剂，氢气和水的存在显著增强了CO转化，这表明反应物与双金属表面之间存在复杂的相互作用。这种效应在其他催化剂（如Pt3Co）上并未观察到相同程度的影响。

文献没有直接提供这些双金属催化剂在水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化方面的信息。同样，也没有讨论超高真空（UHV）研究可能提供的见解或当前UHV研究在铂基双金属表面上的限制。

未来的UHV研究可能会为这些双金属催化剂的表面化学提供宝贵的见解，有助于将观察到的反应器性能与基本表面过程相关联。这些研究可以阐明每种金属在催化过程中的具体作用、活性位点的性质以及表面结构对反应活性的影响。

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly Pt-Co and Pt-Cu intermetallic compounds (IMCs), significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation in preferential oxidation (PROX) reactions. These catalysts show higher activity than pure Pt catalysts at lower temperatures.

The formation of IMCs alters the electronic structure of Pt atoms, making them electron-deficient. This weakens CO adsorption on the catalyst surface, allowing for improved oxygen adsorption. The secondary metal (Co or Cu) in the IMC also plays a role in oxygen adsorption, contributing to the enhanced PROX activity.

The reaction mechanisms differ between pure Pt and IMC catalysts. On Pt, the reaction follows a Rideal mechanism with saturated CO adsorption. In contrast, IMCs follow a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where both CO and O2 adsorption are important.

Hydrogen presence affects the reaction kinetics, particularly for PtCu catalysts. It enhances O2 adsorption, leading to comparable adsorption of CO and O2, which contributes to the high PROX activity at low temperatures.

While the literature doesn't directly address water gas shift reactions or methane conversions, the insights gained from PROX studies suggest that similar electronic and geometric effects could influence these reactions on bimetallic surfaces.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by allowing detailed surface characterization and controlled reaction studies on model Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. This could help correlate the findings from reactor studies with fundamental surface properties, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the role of specific surface sites in catalysis.

双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是Pt-Co和Pt-Cu金属间化合物（IMCs），显著影响了CO优先氧化（PROX）反应的机理和效率。这些催化剂在较低温度下表现出比纯Pt催化剂更高的活性。

IMCs的形成改变了Pt原子的电子结构，使其变为电子缺乏。这削弱了CO在催化剂表面的吸附，从而改善了氧气的吸附。IMC中的第二种金属（Co或Cu）也参与氧气的吸附，促进了PROX活性的提高。

纯Pt和IMC催化剂的反应机理不同。在Pt上，反应遵循Rideal机理，CO吸附饱和。相比之下，IMCs遵循Langmuir-Hinshelwood机理，CO和O2的吸附都很重要。

氢气的存在影响反应动力学，特别是对PtCu催化剂。它增强了O2的吸附，导致CO和O2的吸附程度相当，这有助于在低温下实现高PROX活性。

虽然文献没有直接涉及水气变换反应或甲烷转化，但从PROX研究获得的见解表明，类似的电子和几何效应可能会影响双金属表面上的这些反应。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可以提供宝贵的见解，通过允许对模型Pt基双金属表面进行详细的表面表征和受控反应研究。这可以帮助将反应器研究的发现与基本表面性质相关联，潜在地深化对反应机理和特定表面位点在催化中作用的理解。

Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt3Co and PtCu supported on silica, show higher activity for CO oxidation in the preferential oxidation (PROX) reaction compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The mechanisms and efficiencies are influenced by several factors:

1. Improved oxygen adsorption: The Co and Cu atoms in the intermetallic compounds (IMCs) adsorb oxygen, leading to higher PROX activity at low temperatures.

2. Modified CO adsorption: The formation of IMCs weakens CO adsorption compared to pure Pt surfaces, allowing for more efficient oxidation.

3. Different reaction mechanisms: On Pt3Co, oxygen is mainly adsorbed on Co atoms, while CO adsorbs on Pt. The reaction likely proceeds through a dual-site mechanism. On PtCu, the presence of hydrogen enhances O2 adsorption, leading to comparable adsorption strengths for CO and O2.

4. Hydrogen effects: Hydrogen addition has different impacts on Pt3Co and PtCu catalysts. For PtCu, hydrogen significantly enhances activity by promoting O2 adsorption.

The literature does not provide information on water gas shift reaction or methane conversion mechanisms for these catalysts.

Future UHV studies could provide insights by:

1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions.
2. Studying the adsorption and reaction of individual gases (CO, O2, H2) on model surfaces to correlate with supported catalyst behavior.
3. Examining the effect of support materials on the catalytic properties of Pt-based bimetallic particles.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces may include difficulties in creating well-defined bimetallic surfaces and maintaining the intermetallic structure under UHV conditions.

基于铂的双金属催化剂，特别是负载在二氧化硅上的Pt3Co和PtCu，在优先氧化（PROX）反应中表现出比单金属铂催化剂更高的CO氧化活性。其机理和效率受几个因素影响：

1. 改善的氧气吸附：金属间化合物（IMCs）中的钴和铜原子吸附氧气，导致在低温下具有更高的PROX活性。

2. 改变的CO吸附：IMCs的形成与纯铂表面相比减弱了CO的吸附，从而允许更有效的氧化。

3. 不同的反应机理：在Pt3Co上，氧气主要吸附在钴原子上，而CO吸附在铂上。反应可能通过双位点机理进行。在PtCu上，氢气的存在增强了O2的吸附，导致CO和O2的吸附强度相当。

4. 氢气效应：氢气的添加对Pt3Co和PtCu催化剂有不同的影响。对于PtCu，氢气通过促进O2吸附显著提高活性。

文献没有提供这些催化剂在水气变换反应或甲烷转化机理方面的信息。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可以通过以下方式提供见解：

1. 研究反应条件下基于铂的双金属表面的表面结构和组成。
2. 研究单个气体（CO、O2、H2）在模型表面上的吸附和反应，以与负载催化剂的行为进行对比。
3. 研究载体材料对基于铂的双金属颗粒催化性能的影响。

然而，目前在基于铂的双金属表面的UHV研究中存在一些限制，可能包括创建明确定义的双金属表面的困难，以及在UHV条件下维持金属间化合物结构的挑战。

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly intermetallic compounds (IMCs) like Pt3Co and PtCu, significantly influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in reactor studies. These catalysts show higher activity than pure Pt catalysts at lower temperatures for preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess hydrogen.

The enhanced performance of these bimetallic catalysts is attributed to several factors:

1. Electronic effects: Electron transfer from Pt to Co or Cu atoms results in electron-deficient Pt atoms that adsorb CO more weakly than pure Pt, facilitating oxygen adsorption.

2. Improved oxygen adsorption: Co and Cu atoms in the IMCs also adsorb oxygen, contributing to higher PROX activity at low temperatures.

3. Reaction mechanism: The reaction proceeds through a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, differing from the Rideal mechanism observed on pure Pt surfaces.

4. Hydrogen effects: The presence of hydrogen enhances the activity of PtCu catalysts significantly, while only slightly increasing the activity of Pt and Pt3Co catalysts.

These findings from reactor studies provide valuable insights into the behavior of bimetallic catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces make it challenging to directly correlate these results with model surfaces.

Future UHV studies could potentially bridge this gap by:

1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of well-defined bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions.
2. Studying the adsorption and reaction of CO and oxygen on these surfaces at a molecular level.
3. Examining the effects of hydrogen on the surface chemistry of these bimetallic catalysts.
4. Comparing the reactivity of model surfaces with supported catalysts to understand the role of the support and particle size effects.

Such UHV studies could provide atomic-level insights into the mechanisms underlying the enhanced performance of bimetallic catalysts observed in reactor studies, potentially leading to the design of more efficient catalysts for CO oxidation and related reactions.

双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是Pt3Co和PtCu等金属间化合物（IMCs），在反应器研究中显著影响CO氧化机理和效率。这些催化剂在较低温度下对过量氢气中CO的优先氧化（PROX）表现出比纯Pt催化剂更高的活性。

这些双金属催化剂的增强性能归因于几个因素：

1. 电子效应：Pt向Co或Cu原子的电子转移导致Pt原子缺电子，与纯Pt相比更弱地吸附CO，从而促进氧气吸附。

2. 改善的氧气吸附：IMCs中的Co和Cu原子也吸附氧气，有助于在低温下提高PROX活性。

3. 反应机理：反应通过Langmuir-Hinshelwood机理进行，与纯Pt表面上观察到的Rideal机理不同。

4. 氢气效应：氢气的存在显著增强了PtCu催化剂的活性，而仅略微增加了Pt和Pt3Co催化剂的活性。

这些来自反应器研究的发现为双金属催化剂的行为提供了有价值的见解。然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面的超高真空（UHV）研究方面的限制使得难以直接将这些结果与模型表面相关联。

未来的UHV研究可能通过以下方式弥合这一差距：

1. 研究反应条件下定义明确的双金属表面的表面结构和组成。
2. 在分子水平上研究CO和氧气在这些表面上的吸附和反应。
3. 检查氢气对这些双金属催化剂表面化学的影响。
4. 比较模型表面与负载型催化剂的反应活性，以了解载体和粒子尺寸效应的作用。

这些UHV研究可以提供对反应器研究中观察到的双金属催化剂增强性能背后机理的原子水平见解，可能导致设计出更高效的CO氧化和相关反应的催化剂。

The study focuses on Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, specifically intermetallic compounds (IMCs) like Pt3Co and PtCu, for preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess hydrogen. These catalysts show higher activity than pure Pt catalysts at low temperatures (373-453 K).

The mechanisms of CO oxidation are influenced by the formation of IMCs. On Pt3Co, CO adsorbed on Pt is oxidized by oxygen atoms activated on Co sites. This synergistic effect results in higher activity compared to pure Pt. For PtCu, the presence of hydrogen and water enhances CO conversion, suggesting a different mechanism involving water-assisted CO oxidation.

The study does not directly address water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. However, it notes that the CO shift reaction is negligible during PROX on PtCu/SiO2.

While this research provides valuable insights into reactor studies, it does not discuss UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially bridge the gap between these reactor findings and model surfaces by investigating the atomic-scale interactions and surface structures of Pt-Co and Pt-Cu IMCs. This could help elucidate the exact nature of active sites, the role of electronic effects in modifying adsorption properties, and the mechanisms of cooperative catalysis between Pt and the secondary metal.

Such UHV studies might also provide insights into the stability and surface segregation behavior of these bimetallic catalysts under various conditions, which could be correlated with the observed stability in reactor studies. Additionally, UHV experiments could help clarify the role of water in enhancing activity on PtCu catalysts by allowing controlled introduction of water and studying its effects on surface chemistry.

该研究主要关注基于Pt的双金属催化剂，特别是Pt3Co和PtCu等金属间化合物（IMCs），用于过量氢气中CO的优先氧化（PROX）。这些催化剂在低温下（373-453 K）表现出比纯Pt催化剂更高的活性。

CO氧化的机理受到IMCs形成的影响。在Pt3Co上，吸附在Pt上的CO被在Co位点上活化的氧原子氧化。这种协同效应导致比纯Pt更高的活性。对于PtCu，氢气和水的存在增强了CO转化，表明存在一种不同的机理，可能涉及水辅助CO氧化。

该研究没有直接涉及水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化。但是，它指出在PtCu/SiO2上进行PROX反应时，CO变换反应可以忽略不计。

虽然这项研究为反应器研究提供了宝贵的见解，但它并未讨论Pt基双金属表面的超高真空（UHV）研究。未来的UHV研究可能通过研究Pt-Co和Pt-Cu IMCs的原子尺度相互作用和表面结构，来弥合这些反应器发现与模型表面之间的差距。这可能有助于阐明活性位点的确切性质、电子效应在改变吸附性质中的作用，以及Pt与次要金属之间协同催化的机理。

这些UHV研究还可能提供关于这些双金属催化剂在各种条件下的稳定性和表面偏析行为的见解，这可以与反应器研究中观察到的稳定性相关联。此外，UHV实验可以通过允许控制引入水并研究其对表面化学的影响，来帮助阐明水在增强PtCu催化剂活性中的作用。
