[1] "Pt-based intermetallic compounds (IMCs) supported on silica were studied as a catalyst for the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess hydrogen to obtain the active catalyst at low temperatures."

[2] "Pt3Co/SiO2 and PtCu/SiO2 were more active than Pt/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 in the temperature range of 373453 K."

[3] "Kinetic studies indicated that Co and Cu atoms in IMCs also adsorb oxygen. This improved oxygen adsorption likely resulted in the high PROX activity at low temperatures."

[4] "The CO molecules on Pt would be oxidized by oxygen atoms activated on Co, resulting in higher activity of Pt3Co compared with Pt metal."

[5] "On PtCu/SiO2, however, CO conversion increased by 30% with the addition of hydrogen and even further by the addition of water. The enhancing effect of hydrogen reflected the contribution of water produced by the oxidation of hydrogen during the PROX reaction."

The study focuses on Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, specifically intermetallic compounds (IMCs) like Pt3Co and PtCu, for preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess hydrogen. These catalysts show higher activity than pure Pt catalysts at low temperatures (373-453 K).

The mechanisms of CO oxidation are influenced by the formation of IMCs. On Pt3Co, CO adsorbed on Pt is oxidized by oxygen atoms activated on Co sites. This synergistic effect results in higher activity compared to pure Pt. For PtCu, the presence of hydrogen and water enhances CO conversion, suggesting a different mechanism involving water-assisted CO oxidation.

The study does not directly address water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. However, it notes that the CO shift reaction is negligible during PROX on PtCu/SiO2.

While this research provides valuable insights into reactor studies, it does not discuss UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially bridge the gap between these reactor findings and model surfaces by investigating the atomic-scale interactions and surface structures of Pt-Co and Pt-Cu IMCs. This could help elucidate the exact nature of active sites, the role of electronic effects in modifying adsorption properties, and the mechanisms of cooperative catalysis between Pt and the secondary metal.

Such UHV studies might also provide insights into the stability and surface segregation behavior of these bimetallic catalysts under various conditions, which could be correlated with the observed stability in reactor studies. Additionally, UHV experiments could help clarify the role of water in enhancing activity on PtCu catalysts by allowing controlled introduction of water and studying its effects on surface chemistry.

该研究主要关注基于Pt的双金属催化剂，特别是Pt3Co和PtCu等金属间化合物（IMCs），用于过量氢气中CO的优先氧化（PROX）。这些催化剂在低温下（373-453 K）表现出比纯Pt催化剂更高的活性。

CO氧化的机理受到IMCs形成的影响。在Pt3Co上，吸附在Pt上的CO被在Co位点上活化的氧原子氧化。这种协同效应导致比纯Pt更高的活性。对于PtCu，氢气和水的存在增强了CO转化，表明存在一种不同的机理，可能涉及水辅助CO氧化。

该研究没有直接涉及水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化。但是，它指出在PtCu/SiO2上进行PROX反应时，CO变换反应可以忽略不计。

虽然这项研究为反应器研究提供了宝贵的见解，但它并未讨论Pt基双金属表面的超高真空（UHV）研究。未来的UHV研究可能通过研究Pt-Co和Pt-Cu IMCs的原子尺度相互作用和表面结构，来弥合这些反应器发现与模型表面之间的差距。这可能有助于阐明活性位点的确切性质、电子效应在改变吸附性质中的作用，以及Pt与次要金属之间协同催化的机理。

这些UHV研究还可能提供关于这些双金属催化剂在各种条件下的稳定性和表面偏析行为的见解，这可以与反应器研究中观察到的稳定性相关联。此外，UHV实验可以通过允许控制引入水并研究其对表面化学的影响，来帮助阐明水在增强PtCu催化剂活性中的作用。
