[1] "Pt-based intermetallic compounds (IMCs) supported on silica were studied as a catalyst for the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess hydrogen to obtain the active catalyst at low temperatures."

[2] "Pt3Co/SiO2 and PtCu/SiO2 were more active than Pt/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 in the temperature range of 373453 K."

[3] "Infrared (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and adsorption measurements revealed a significant electron transfer from Pt atoms to Co or Cu atoms. The electron-deficient Pt atoms adsorbed CO weakly compared with Pt metal, accelerating the adsorption of oxygen on the IMC surface."

[4] "Kinetic studies indicated that Co and Cu atoms in IMCs also adsorb oxygen. This improved oxygen adsorption likely resulted in the high PROX activity at low temperatures."

[5] "In the case of PtCu/SiO2, however, the reaction order with respect to P(O2) was negative in the presence of hydrogen (Fig. 15 a) but positive without hydrogen. As a result, the adsorptions of CO and O2 were almost comparable in the presence of hydrogen. Hydrogen enhanced the adsorption of O2."

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly Pt-Co and Pt-Cu intermetallic compounds (IMCs), significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation in preferential oxidation (PROX) reactions. These catalysts show higher activity than pure Pt catalysts at lower temperatures.

The formation of IMCs alters the electronic structure of Pt atoms, making them electron-deficient. This weakens CO adsorption on the catalyst surface, allowing for improved oxygen adsorption. The secondary metal (Co or Cu) in the IMC also plays a role in oxygen adsorption, contributing to the enhanced PROX activity.

The reaction mechanisms differ between pure Pt and IMC catalysts. On Pt, the reaction follows a Rideal mechanism with saturated CO adsorption. In contrast, IMCs follow a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where both CO and O2 adsorption are important.

Hydrogen presence affects the reaction kinetics, particularly for PtCu catalysts. It enhances O2 adsorption, leading to comparable adsorption of CO and O2, which contributes to the high PROX activity at low temperatures.

While the literature doesn't directly address water gas shift reactions or methane conversions, the insights gained from PROX studies suggest that similar electronic and geometric effects could influence these reactions on bimetallic surfaces.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by allowing detailed surface characterization and controlled reaction studies on model Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. This could help correlate the findings from reactor studies with fundamental surface properties, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the role of specific surface sites in catalysis.

双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是Pt-Co和Pt-Cu金属间化合物（IMCs），显著影响了CO优先氧化（PROX）反应的机理和效率。这些催化剂在较低温度下表现出比纯Pt催化剂更高的活性。

IMCs的形成改变了Pt原子的电子结构，使其变为电子缺乏。这削弱了CO在催化剂表面的吸附，从而改善了氧气的吸附。IMC中的第二种金属（Co或Cu）也参与氧气的吸附，促进了PROX活性的提高。

纯Pt和IMC催化剂的反应机理不同。在Pt上，反应遵循Rideal机理，CO吸附饱和。相比之下，IMCs遵循Langmuir-Hinshelwood机理，CO和O2的吸附都很重要。

氢气的存在影响反应动力学，特别是对PtCu催化剂。它增强了O2的吸附，导致CO和O2的吸附程度相当，这有助于在低温下实现高PROX活性。

虽然文献没有直接涉及水气变换反应或甲烷转化，但从PROX研究获得的见解表明，类似的电子和几何效应可能会影响双金属表面上的这些反应。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可以提供宝贵的见解，通过允许对模型Pt基双金属表面进行详细的表面表征和受控反应研究。这可以帮助将反应器研究的发现与基本表面性质相关联，潜在地深化对反应机理和特定表面位点在催化中作用的理解。
