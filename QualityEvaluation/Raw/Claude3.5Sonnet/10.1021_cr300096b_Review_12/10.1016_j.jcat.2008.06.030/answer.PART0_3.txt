[1] "Pt-based intermetallic compounds (IMCs) supported on silica were studied as a catalyst for the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess hydrogen to obtain the active catalyst at low temperatures."

[2] "Pt3Co/SiO2 and PtCu/SiO2 were more active than Pt/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 in the temperature range of 373453 K."

[3] "Infrared (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and adsorption measurements revealed a significant electron transfer from Pt atoms to Co or Cu atoms. The electron-deficient Pt atoms adsorbed CO weakly compared with Pt metal, accelerating the adsorption of oxygen on the IMC surface."

[4] "Kinetic studies indicated that Co and Cu atoms in IMCs also adsorb oxygen. This improved oxygen adsorption likely resulted in the high PROX activity at low temperatures."

[5] "The reaction proceeded through the LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism, as has been proposed on PtFe/mordenite"

[6] "Comparing CO2 formation rates obtained with and without hydrogen reveals that the activity of Pt and Pt3Co increased slightly and that of PtCu increased significantly with the addition of hydrogen."

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly intermetallic compounds (IMCs) like Pt3Co and PtCu, significantly influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in reactor studies. These catalysts show higher activity than pure Pt catalysts at lower temperatures for preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess hydrogen.

The enhanced performance of these bimetallic catalysts is attributed to several factors:

1. Electronic effects: Electron transfer from Pt to Co or Cu atoms results in electron-deficient Pt atoms that adsorb CO more weakly than pure Pt, facilitating oxygen adsorption.

2. Improved oxygen adsorption: Co and Cu atoms in the IMCs also adsorb oxygen, contributing to higher PROX activity at low temperatures.

3. Reaction mechanism: The reaction proceeds through a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, differing from the Rideal mechanism observed on pure Pt surfaces.

4. Hydrogen effects: The presence of hydrogen enhances the activity of PtCu catalysts significantly, while only slightly increasing the activity of Pt and Pt3Co catalysts.

These findings from reactor studies provide valuable insights into the behavior of bimetallic catalysts. However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces make it challenging to directly correlate these results with model surfaces.

Future UHV studies could potentially bridge this gap by:

1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of well-defined bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions.
2. Studying the adsorption and reaction of CO and oxygen on these surfaces at a molecular level.
3. Examining the effects of hydrogen on the surface chemistry of these bimetallic catalysts.
4. Comparing the reactivity of model surfaces with supported catalysts to understand the role of the support and particle size effects.

Such UHV studies could provide atomic-level insights into the mechanisms underlying the enhanced performance of bimetallic catalysts observed in reactor studies, potentially leading to the design of more efficient catalysts for CO oxidation and related reactions.

双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是Pt3Co和PtCu等金属间化合物（IMCs），在反应器研究中显著影响CO氧化机理和效率。这些催化剂在较低温度下对过量氢气中CO的优先氧化（PROX）表现出比纯Pt催化剂更高的活性。

这些双金属催化剂的增强性能归因于几个因素：

1. 电子效应：Pt向Co或Cu原子的电子转移导致Pt原子缺电子，与纯Pt相比更弱地吸附CO，从而促进氧气吸附。

2. 改善的氧气吸附：IMCs中的Co和Cu原子也吸附氧气，有助于在低温下提高PROX活性。

3. 反应机理：反应通过Langmuir-Hinshelwood机理进行，与纯Pt表面上观察到的Rideal机理不同。

4. 氢气效应：氢气的存在显著增强了PtCu催化剂的活性，而仅略微增加了Pt和Pt3Co催化剂的活性。

这些来自反应器研究的发现为双金属催化剂的行为提供了有价值的见解。然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面的超高真空（UHV）研究方面的限制使得难以直接将这些结果与模型表面相关联。

未来的UHV研究可能通过以下方式弥合这一差距：

1. 研究反应条件下定义明确的双金属表面的表面结构和组成。
2. 在分子水平上研究CO和氧气在这些表面上的吸附和反应。
3. 检查氢气对这些双金属催化剂表面化学的影响。
4. 比较模型表面与负载型催化剂的反应活性，以了解载体和粒子尺寸效应的作用。

这些UHV研究可以提供对反应器研究中观察到的双金属催化剂增强性能背后机理的原子水平见解，可能导致设计出更高效的CO氧化和相关反应的催化剂。
