[1] "Experimental studies showed that (i) the active site properties of a catalyst determine its performance and (ii) the structure of the support as well as of the active site can be tailored, when a support that has a modifiable surface chemistry, like activated carbon (AC), is used"

[2] "Recent studies on AC supported PtSn showed that the presence of PtSn alloys, especially Pt3Sn, drastically changes the activity and stability characteristics of the catalyst in CO oxidation for both H2-free and H2-rich streams."

[3] "Considering the fact that the anode of fuel cells is Pt-coated carbon and it suffers from CO poisoning when hydrogen feed contains CO impurity concentration greater than 4 ppm, understanding COPt3Sn interaction may lead a way to the design and development of a new anode made up of carbon coated with Pt3Sn."

The literature provides some insights on how Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts influence CO oxidation, but does not directly address water gas shift or methane conversion reactions. For CO oxidation, Pt-Sn alloys, especially Pt3Sn, significantly change the activity and stability of the catalyst in both H2-free and H2-rich streams when supported on activated carbon. The presence of Sn alters the electronic structure and CO adsorption properties of Pt sites.

The document does not discuss UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, so potential insights from future UHV work cannot be directly inferred. However, understanding CO-Pt3Sn interactions at the molecular level could help design improved anodes for fuel cells that are less susceptible to CO poisoning. 

To fully address the question, additional studies would be needed on:
1. Water gas shift and methane conversion reactions over Pt-Sn catalysts
2. UHV experiments on well-defined Pt-Sn model surfaces
3. Correlations between UHV results and reactor studies with supported catalysts

The literature suggests tailoring the support and active site structure could optimize catalyst performance, but more research is needed to connect fundamental surface science with applied catalysis for these reactions.

该文献提供了一些关于Pt-Sn双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化的见解,但没有直接涉及水煤气变换或甲烷转化反应。对于CO氧化,当以活性炭为载体时,Pt-Sn合金(尤其是Pt3Sn)在无H2和富H2的气流中都显著改变了催化剂的活性和稳定性。Sn的存在改变了Pt位点的电子结构和CO吸附性质。

该文件没有讨论Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究,因此无法直接推断未来UHV工作的潜在见解。然而,在分子水平上理解CO-Pt3Sn相互作用可能有助于设计改进的燃料电池阳极,使其不易受到CO中毒。

要全面回答这个问题,还需要对以下方面进行额外研究:
1. Pt-Sn催化剂上的水煤气变换和甲烷转化反应
2. 在定义明确的Pt-Sn模型表面上进行UHV实验
3. UHV结果与载体催化剂反应器研究之间的相关性

文献表明,调整载体和活性位点结构可以优化催化剂性能,但需要更多研究来将基础表面科学与这些反应的应用催化联系起来。
