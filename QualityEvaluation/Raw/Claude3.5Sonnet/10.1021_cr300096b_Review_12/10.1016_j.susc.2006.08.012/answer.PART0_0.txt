[1] "Recent studies on AC supported PtSn showed that the presence of PtSn alloys, especially Pt3Sn, drastically changes the activity and stability characteristics of the catalyst in CO oxidation for both H2-free and H2-rich streams."

[2] "Experimental studies showed that (i) the active site properties of a catalyst determine its performance and (ii) the structure of the support as well as of the active site can be tailored, when a support that has a modifiable surface chemistry, like activated carbon (AC), is used"

[3] "The comparison reveals that adsorption of CO is stronger on Pt surfaces; this may be the reason why catalysts with Pt3Sn phase do not suffer from CO posioning in experimental works."

The literature provides some insights into how Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts influence CO oxidation, but does not directly address water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. For CO oxidation, Pt3Sn alloys drastically change the activity and stability of catalysts in both H2-free and H2-rich streams compared to pure Pt. The weaker adsorption of CO on Pt3Sn surfaces compared to pure Pt surfaces may explain why Pt3Sn catalysts are more resistant to CO poisoning. 

The document does not discuss UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces or their potential insights. However, it does mention that experimental studies have shown catalyst performance is determined by active site properties, and that both the support structure and active site can be tailored when using a support with modifiable surface chemistry like activated carbon. This suggests UHV studies on model bimetallic surfaces could potentially provide valuable correlations to explain the improved performance seen in reactor studies with supported catalysts.

To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed on UHV studies of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and their relevance to water gas shift and methane conversion reactions. The current literature focuses primarily on CO oxidation.

文献提供了一些关于Pt-Sn双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化的见解，但并未直接涉及水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化。对于CO氧化，与纯Pt相比，Pt3Sn合金在无H2和富H2气流中都能显著改变催化剂的活性和稳定性。与纯Pt表面相比，CO在Pt3Sn表面上的吸附较弱，这可能解释了为什么Pt3Sn催化剂对CO中毒更具抗性。

文献没有讨论Pt基双金属表面的超高真空(UHV)研究或其潜在见解。然而，它确实提到实验研究表明催化剂性能取决于活性位点的特性，并且当使用具有可修饰表面化学性质的载体（如活性炭）时，载体结构和活性位点都可以进行调整。这表明在模型双金属表面上进行的UHV研究可能会提供有价值的相关性，以解释在反应器研究中观察到的负载型催化剂性能改善。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要对Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究及其与水煤气变换和甲烷转化反应的相关性进行额外研究。目前的文献主要集中在CO氧化方面。
