[1] "These studies have shown the effects of surface chemical properties, preparation method and the Pt:Sn ratio on the properties as well as activities of these catalysts in different reactions"

[2] "It has been reported that, after reduction, the metallic Pt and Sn formed are predominantly PtSn alloys with hydroxy groups on Pt/SnOx, which are involved in CO oxidation"

[3] "The results indicate the beneficial use of AC supports rich in surface oxygen bearing groups, which lead to the formation of Pt-rich alloys without an additional oxidation step of the catalyst after reduction."

[4] "The results that have already been published in Part I [7] are summarized whenever necessary."

[5] "The activity of PtSn/AC catalysts in CO oxidation reaction is strongly affected by the surface chemistry of the support, the preparation method of the catalyst, the Pt:Sn ratio and the reduction procedure applied."

The literature provides some insights into how bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts influence CO oxidation, but does not directly address water gas shift or methane conversion reactions. For CO oxidation:

1. PtSn alloys formed after reduction are reported to be active for CO oxidation, with hydroxy groups on Pt/SnOx involved in the reaction mechanism.

2. The surface chemistry of the support, preparation method, Pt:Sn ratio, and reduction procedure strongly affect catalyst activity. 

3. Supports rich in surface oxygen groups promote formation of Pt-rich alloys beneficial for CO oxidation.

4. Optimization of these factors can lead to highly active catalysts, with one achieving 100% CO conversion under certain conditions.

The literature does not provide information on UHV studies or model surfaces for these reactions. To fully answer the question, additional research focused specifically on water gas shift, methane conversion, and UHV studies of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces would be needed to draw connections between reactor studies and model catalysts.

这篇文献为双金属Pt-Sn催化剂如何影响CO氧化提供了一些见解,但没有直接涉及水煤气变换或甲烷转化反应。对于CO氧化:

1. 报道称,还原后形成的PtSn合金对CO氧化具有活性,其中Pt/SnOx上的羟基参与反应机理。

2. 载体的表面化学性质、制备方法、Pt:Sn比例以及还原程序强烈影响催化剂活性。

3. 富含表面含氧基团的载体促进形成有利于CO氧化的富Pt合金。

4. 优化这些因素可以得到高活性催化剂,其中一种在特定条件下实现了100%的CO转化率。

文献没有提供关于这些反应的超高真空研究或模型表面的信息。要全面回答这个问题,还需要针对水煤气变换、甲烷转化以及Pt基双金属表面的超高真空研究进行额外的研究,以建立反应器研究和模型催化剂之间的联系。
