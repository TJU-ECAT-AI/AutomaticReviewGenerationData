[1] "It has been reported that, after reduction, the metallic Pt and Sn formed are predominantly PtSn alloys with hydroxy groups on Pt/SnOx, which are involved in CO oxidation"

[2] "The results reported clearly show the catalytic CO oxidation activity at lower temperatures when the Pt3Sn alloy phase is present in these catalysts"

[3] "Of the two Pt alloys, PtSn and Pt3Sn, the Pt rich Pt3Sn can adsorb oxygen more readily at lower temperatures than PtSn"

[4] "It has been proposed in the literature that the CO oxidation reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and adsorbed O"

[5] "The inactivity of the monometallic samples can be explained by this inhibition of oxygen adsorption, due to adsorbed carbon monoxide which can block the Pt sites within the first minutes of the reaction."

Bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts influence CO oxidation mechanisms and efficiencies in several ways:

1. PtSn alloys with hydroxy groups on Pt/SnOx are involved in CO oxidation.

2. The Pt3Sn alloy phase enables CO oxidation activity at lower temperatures compared to PtSn.

3. Pt3Sn can adsorb oxygen more readily at lower temperatures than PtSn, which is important for the reaction mechanism.

4. The CO oxidation reaction occurs between adsorbed CO and adsorbed O on the catalyst surface.

5. Bimetallic catalysts help overcome the inhibition of oxygen adsorption that occurs on monometallic Pt catalysts due to CO blocking the active sites.

The literature does not provide information on water gas shift reactions or methane conversions for these catalysts. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into the surface chemistry and adsorption properties of Pt-Sn alloys, which could help correlate reactor studies with model surfaces. However, the current literature does not discuss limitations of UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces or potential insights they could provide.

双金属Pt-Sn催化剂以几种方式影响CO氧化机理和效率：

1. 带有Pt/SnOx上羟基的PtSn合金参与CO氧化反应。

2. Pt3Sn合金相能够在较低温度下实现CO氧化活性，相比PtSn更有优势。

3. Pt3Sn在较低温度下可以更容易地吸附氧气，这对反应机理很重要。

4. CO氧化反应发生在催化剂表面吸附的CO和吸附的O之间。

5. 双金属催化剂有助于克服单金属Pt催化剂上由于CO阻塞活性位点而导致的氧气吸附抑制。

文献中没有提供这些催化剂在水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化方面的信息。未来的超高真空(UHV)研究可能会提供关于Pt-Sn合金表面化学和吸附性质的见解，这可能有助于将反应器研究与模型表面相关联。然而，当前文献并未讨论UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的局限性或它们可能提供的潜在见解。
