[1] "Effects of methane oxygen mixture addition to steam reforming of methane and subsequent removal of the methane oxygen mixture from the oxidative steam reforming of methane on catalytic performance were investigated using monometallic Ni and Pt catalysts and two PtNi bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "Hysteresis with respect to the addition and removal of the methane oxygen mixture was observed clearly on a PtNi bimetallic catalyst prepared by co-impregnation method and the Ni catalyst. In contrast, no hysteresis was observed for a PtNi catalyst that was prepared by sequential impregnation method."

[3] "PtNi catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation is formed PtNi alloy particles, where Pt atoms are segregated on the surface, enhances the reducibility of Ni drastically and this is related to the behavior without hysteresis."

[4] "In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the temperature over the catalyst bed inlet is high. However, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase than other catalysts, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone."

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtNi catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversions in reactor studies. These catalysts show improved performance in oxidative steam reforming of methane compared to monometallic Ni or Pt catalysts.

The key advantages of PtNi bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Reduced hysteresis: PtNi catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation method show no hysteresis with respect to the addition and removal of methane-oxygen mixture, unlike Ni catalysts or PtNi catalysts prepared by co-impregnation.

2. Enhanced reducibility: The formation of PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated on the surface drastically enhances the reducibility of Ni. This increased reducibility is linked to the absence of hysteresis behavior.

3. Improved temperature control: In oxidative steam reforming of methane, PtNi catalysts more effectively suppress temperature increases at the catalyst bed inlet compared to other catalysts. This is attributed to the overlap of exothermic combustion and endothermic reforming reaction zones, made possible by the high reducibility of the catalyst.

While the literature does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions, the improved performance in methane conversion suggests that these bimetallic catalysts may also show enhanced activity in these related reactions.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by:

1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of PtNi alloy particles under controlled conditions.
2. Studying the adsorption and reaction of relevant species (CH4, O2, CO, H2O) on model PtNi surfaces.
3. Examining the effect of Pt segregation on the surface reactivity and reducibility of Ni.
4. Correlating the atomic-scale structure and properties observed in UHV with the performance of supported catalysts in reactor studies.

These UHV studies could help elucidate the fundamental mechanisms behind the enhanced performance of PtNi bimetallic catalysts, potentially leading to the design of even more efficient catalysts for various reactions.

双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是通过序列浸渍法制备的PtNi催化剂，显著影响了反应器研究中甲烷转化的机理和效率。与单金属Ni或Pt催化剂相比，这些催化剂在甲烷的氧化蒸汽重整反应中表现出更好的性能。

PtNi双金属催化剂的主要优势包括：

1. 减少滞后现象：通过序列浸渍法制备的PtNi催化剂在甲烷-氧气混合物的添加和移除过程中不显示滞后现象，这与Ni催化剂或共浸渍法制备的PtNi催化剂不同。

2. 提高还原性：形成表面Pt原子偏析的PtNi合金颗粒大大提高了Ni的还原性。这种增强的还原性与滞后行为的缺失有关。

3. 改善温度控制：在甲烷的氧化蒸汽重整反应中，PtNi催化剂比其他催化剂更有效地抑制了催化剂床入口处的温度升高。这归因于放热燃烧反应区和吸热重整反应区的重叠，这种重叠是由催化剂的高还原性实现的。

虽然文献没有直接涉及CO氧化或水气变换反应，但在甲烷转化方面的改进性能表明，这些双金属催化剂在这些相关反应中也可能表现出增强的活性。

未来的UHV研究可以提供有价值的见解，通过：

1. 在受控条件下研究PtNi合金颗粒的表面结构和组成。
2. 研究相关物种（CH4、O2、CO、H2O）在PtNi模型表面上的吸附和反应。
3. 检查Pt偏析对Ni表面反应性和还原性的影响。
4. 将UHV中观察到的原子尺度结构和性质与反应器研究中负载催化剂的性能相关联。

这些UHV研究可以帮助阐明PtNi双金属催化剂性能增强背后的基本机理，可能导致设计出更高效的各种反应催化剂。
