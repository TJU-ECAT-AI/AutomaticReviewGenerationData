[1] "Results show that the band of the linear CO on Pt has almost the same position as that of multi-carbonyl species of Ni. Consequently, the relative intensity of the bands at 2070 and 2020 cm−1 was considered for the peak assignment in the bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "In contrast, no hysteresis was observed for Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6). Methane conversion at the steam reforming of methane (Fig. 2 (d) A) was lower than that for Ni(2.6) and Pt(0.1) + Ni(2.6). However, Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) gave the highest methane conversion in oxidative steam reforming of methane."

[3] "Characterization of results using Pt L3-edge and Ni K-edge EXAFS analysis and FTIR of CO adsorption suggest that the PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated to the surface can be formed on the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6), which might be related to the lack of hysteresis behavior by high reducibility and the suppression of the deep oxidation of Ni species."

[4] "In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the temperature over the catalyst bed inlet is high. However, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase than other catalysts, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone."

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly Pt-Ni, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversion in reactor studies. The Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst showed the highest methane conversion in oxidative steam reforming without hysteresis, indicating improved stability and activity compared to monometallic catalysts. This enhanced performance is attributed to the formation of PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated on the surface, leading to higher reducibility and suppression of deep Ni oxidation.

The Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst also demonstrated better temperature control during oxidative steam reforming, effectively suppressing temperature increases at the catalyst bed inlet. This is explained by the high reducibility of the catalyst, which causes an overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone.

While the literature does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions, the improved performance in methane conversion suggests that similar benefits might be observed for these reactions as well.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. Such studies could help elucidate the precise surface structure and composition of the PtNi alloy particles, the nature of active sites, and the mechanisms behind the enhanced reducibility and oxidation resistance. This could lead to a better understanding of the structure-activity relationships in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts and guide the development of more efficient catalysts for various reactions.

However, it's important to note that current UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces have limitations. These studies may not fully replicate the complex conditions present in reactor studies, such as high pressures and temperatures. Bridging this gap between UHV and reactor studies remains a challenge in the field of catalysis research.

双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是Pt-Ni，显著影响了反应器研究中甲烷转化的机理和效率。Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂在氧化蒸汽重整中表现出最高的甲烷转化率，且无滞后现象，表明其稳定性和活性优于单金属催化剂。这种性能的提升归因于表面富集Pt原子的PtNi合金粒子的形成，从而导致更高的还原性和抑制Ni的深度氧化。

Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂在氧化蒸汽重整过程中还表现出更好的温度控制能力，有效抑制了催化剂床入口处的温度升高。这可以解释为催化剂的高还原性导致放热燃烧反应区与吸热重整反应区的重叠。

虽然文献并未直接涉及CO氧化或水气变换反应，但在甲烷转化方面的性能改善表明，这些反应也可能观察到类似的优势。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可以通过将这些发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联，提供宝贵的见解。这些研究可以帮助阐明PtNi合金粒子的精确表面结构和组成、活性位点的性质，以及增强还原性和抗氧化性的机制。这可能会带来对Pt基双金属催化剂结构-活性关系的更好理解，并指导开发更高效的各种反应催化剂。

然而，需要注意的是，目前对Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究存在局限性。这些研究可能无法完全复制反应器研究中存在的复杂条件，如高压和高温。弥合UHV研究和反应器研究之间的差距仍然是催化研究领域的一个挑战。
