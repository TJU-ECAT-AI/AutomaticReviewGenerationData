[1] "For this study, we investigated the effect of added methane oxygen mixture (CH4/O2/Ar = 40/2x/60−2x; for x = 0 through 10) to steam reforming (CH4/H2O/Ar = 40/30/30) and the effect of methane oxygen mixture removal from oxidative steam reforming (CH4/H2O/O2/Ar = 40/30/20/10) on the catalytic performance and the bed temperature profile over monometallic Pt and Ni, and bimetallic PtNi catalysts."

[2] "Results show that the Ni(2.6) and Pt(0.1)+Ni(2.6) showed hysteresis between the steam reforming and the oxidative steam reforming. It is interpreted that the hysteresis can be caused by the deep oxidation of Ni species on the basis that metallic Ni species is the active site for the reforming reaction and the oxidized Ni species do not."

[3] "No hysteresis for the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) means that the deep oxidation of Ni is suppressed by the high reducibility of PtNi alloy particles, where Pt atoms are segregated on the particle surface. In addition, high reducibility can maintain the metallic state of Ni, even in the presence of oxygen."

[4] "Characterization of results using Pt LIII-edge and Ni K-edge EXAFS analysis and FTIR of CO adsorption suggest that the PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated to the surface can be formed on the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6), which might be related to the lack of hysteresis behavior by high reducibility and the suppression of the deep oxidation of Ni species."

The bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts, particularly those prepared by sequential impregnation (Pt/Ni), show improved performance in methane conversion reactions compared to monometallic Ni or co-impregnated Pt+Ni catalysts. 

The key mechanism appears to be the formation of PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated on the surface. This structure enhances the reducibility of Ni, allowing it to maintain its metallic state even in oxidizing conditions. As a result, the Pt/Ni catalyst shows no hysteresis between steam reforming and oxidative steam reforming, unlike Ni-only or co-impregnated catalysts.

The high reducibility of the Pt/Ni catalyst allows it to be active for both methane combustion and reforming reactions simultaneously. This overlap of reaction zones helps to suppress temperature increases in the catalyst bed, leading to more efficient and stable operation.

While the study does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions, the improved oxidation resistance and maintained metallic state of Ni in the Pt/Ni catalyst suggest potential benefits for these reactions as well.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by allowing detailed investigation of the surface structure and composition of these bimetallic catalysts. This could help correlate the observed reactor performance with specific surface properties, potentially leading to further catalyst optimizations. However, the current literature does not mention specific limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, so further research would be needed to identify and address these challenges.

双金属Pt-Ni催化剂，特别是通过序列浸渍法制备的(Pt/Ni)催化剂，在甲烷转化反应中表现出比单金属Ni或共浸渍Pt+Ni催化剂更好的性能。

关键机制似乎是形成了表面富集Pt原子的PtNi合金颗粒。这种结构增强了Ni的还原性，使其即使在氧化条件下也能保持金属态。因此，与仅含Ni或共浸渍催化剂不同，Pt/Ni催化剂在蒸汽重整和氧化蒸汽重整之间没有滞后现象。

Pt/Ni催化剂的高还原性使其能够同时催化甲烷燃烧和重整反应。反应区域的这种重叠有助于抑制催化剂床层的温度升高，从而实现更高效和稳定的操作。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及CO氧化或水煤气变换反应，但Pt/Ni催化剂改善的抗氧化性和维持的Ni金属态表明这些反应也可能受益。

未来的超高真空(UHV)研究可以通过允许详细调查这些双金属催化剂的表面结构和成分，提供有价值的见解。这可以帮助将观察到的反应器性能与特定的表面性质相关联，可能导致进一步的催化剂优化。然而，现有文献并未提及UHV研究Pt基双金属表面的具体限制，因此需要进一步研究来识别和解决这些挑战。

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtNi catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversions in reactor studies. These catalysts show improved performance in oxidative steam reforming of methane compared to monometallic Ni or Pt catalysts.

The key advantages of PtNi bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Reduced hysteresis: PtNi catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation method show no hysteresis with respect to the addition and removal of methane-oxygen mixture, unlike Ni catalysts or PtNi catalysts prepared by co-impregnation.

2. Enhanced reducibility: The formation of PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated on the surface drastically enhances the reducibility of Ni. This increased reducibility is linked to the absence of hysteresis behavior.

3. Improved temperature control: In oxidative steam reforming of methane, PtNi catalysts more effectively suppress temperature increases at the catalyst bed inlet compared to other catalysts. This is attributed to the overlap of exothermic combustion and endothermic reforming reaction zones, made possible by the high reducibility of the catalyst.

While the literature does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions, the improved performance in methane conversion suggests that these bimetallic catalysts may also show enhanced activity in these related reactions.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by:

1. Investigating the surface structure and composition of PtNi alloy particles under controlled conditions.
2. Studying the adsorption and reaction of relevant species (CH4, O2, CO, H2O) on model PtNi surfaces.
3. Examining the effect of Pt segregation on the surface reactivity and reducibility of Ni.
4. Correlating the atomic-scale structure and properties observed in UHV with the performance of supported catalysts in reactor studies.

These UHV studies could help elucidate the fundamental mechanisms behind the enhanced performance of PtNi bimetallic catalysts, potentially leading to the design of even more efficient catalysts for various reactions.

双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是通过序列浸渍法制备的PtNi催化剂，显著影响了反应器研究中甲烷转化的机理和效率。与单金属Ni或Pt催化剂相比，这些催化剂在甲烷的氧化蒸汽重整反应中表现出更好的性能。

PtNi双金属催化剂的主要优势包括：

1. 减少滞后现象：通过序列浸渍法制备的PtNi催化剂在甲烷-氧气混合物的添加和移除过程中不显示滞后现象，这与Ni催化剂或共浸渍法制备的PtNi催化剂不同。

2. 提高还原性：形成表面Pt原子偏析的PtNi合金颗粒大大提高了Ni的还原性。这种增强的还原性与滞后行为的缺失有关。

3. 改善温度控制：在甲烷的氧化蒸汽重整反应中，PtNi催化剂比其他催化剂更有效地抑制了催化剂床入口处的温度升高。这归因于放热燃烧反应区和吸热重整反应区的重叠，这种重叠是由催化剂的高还原性实现的。

虽然文献没有直接涉及CO氧化或水气变换反应，但在甲烷转化方面的改进性能表明，这些双金属催化剂在这些相关反应中也可能表现出增强的活性。

未来的UHV研究可以提供有价值的见解，通过：

1. 在受控条件下研究PtNi合金颗粒的表面结构和组成。
2. 研究相关物种（CH4、O2、CO、H2O）在PtNi模型表面上的吸附和反应。
3. 检查Pt偏析对Ni表面反应性和还原性的影响。
4. 将UHV中观察到的原子尺度结构和性质与反应器研究中负载催化剂的性能相关联。

这些UHV研究可以帮助阐明PtNi双金属催化剂性能增强背后的基本机理，可能导致设计出更高效的各种反应催化剂。

[1] "Results show that the band of the linear CO on Pt has almost the same position as that of multi-carbonyl species of Ni. Consequently, the relative intensity of the bands at 2070 and 2020 cm−1 was considered for the peak assignment in the bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "In contrast, no hysteresis was observed for Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6). Methane conversion at the steam reforming of methane (Fig. 2 (d) A) was lower than that for Ni(2.6) and Pt(0.1) + Ni(2.6). However, Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) gave the highest methane conversion in oxidative steam reforming of methane."

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly Pt-Ni, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversion in reactor studies. The Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst showed the highest methane conversion in oxidative steam reforming without hysteresis, indicating improved stability and activity compared to monometallic catalysts. This enhanced performance is attributed to the formation of PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated on the surface, leading to higher reducibility and suppression of deep Ni oxidation.

The Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst also demonstrated better temperature control during oxidative steam reforming, effectively suppressing temperature increases at the catalyst bed inlet. This is explained by the high reducibility of the catalyst, which causes an overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone.

While the literature does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions, the improved performance in methane conversion suggests that similar benefits might be observed for these reactions as well.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. Such studies could help elucidate the precise surface structure and composition of the PtNi alloy particles, the nature of active sites, and the mechanisms behind the enhanced reducibility and oxidation resistance. This could lead to a better understanding of the structure-activity relationships in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts and guide the development of more efficient catalysts for various reactions.

However, it's important to note that current UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces have limitations. These studies may not fully replicate the complex conditions present in reactor studies, such as high pressures and temperatures. Bridging this gap between UHV and reactor studies remains a challenge in the field of catalysis research.

双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是Pt-Ni，显著影响了反应器研究中甲烷转化的机理和效率。Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂在氧化蒸汽重整中表现出最高的甲烷转化率，且无滞后现象，表明其稳定性和活性优于单金属催化剂。这种性能的提升归因于表面富集Pt原子的PtNi合金粒子的形成，从而导致更高的还原性和抑制Ni的深度氧化。

Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂在氧化蒸汽重整过程中还表现出更好的温度控制能力，有效抑制了催化剂床入口处的温度升高。这可以解释为催化剂的高还原性导致放热燃烧反应区与吸热重整反应区的重叠。

虽然文献并未直接涉及CO氧化或水气变换反应，但在甲烷转化方面的性能改善表明，这些反应也可能观察到类似的优势。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可以通过将这些发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联，提供宝贵的见解。这些研究可以帮助阐明PtNi合金粒子的精确表面结构和组成、活性位点的性质，以及增强还原性和抗氧化性的机制。这可能会带来对Pt基双金属催化剂结构-活性关系的更好理解，并指导开发更高效的各种反应催化剂。

然而，需要注意的是，目前对Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究存在局限性。这些研究可能无法完全复制反应器研究中存在的复杂条件，如高压和高温。弥合UHV研究和反应器研究之间的差距仍然是催化研究领域的一个挑战。

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtNi catalysts, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversions in reactor studies. The study demonstrates that PtNi bimetallic catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation method show superior performance compared to monometallic Ni or Pt catalysts and PtNi catalysts prepared by co-impregnation.

The PtNi catalyst prepared by sequential impregnation forms PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated on the surface. This structure enhances the reducibility of Ni dramatically, leading to several beneficial effects:

1. Elimination of hysteresis: Unlike Ni catalysts or PtNi catalysts prepared by co-impregnation, the sequentially impregnated PtNi catalyst shows no hysteresis with respect to the addition and removal of methane-oxygen mixture. This indicates stable performance across different reaction conditions.

2. Suppression of deep oxidation: The high reducibility of the PtNi alloy particles prevents deep oxidation of Ni species, maintaining catalytic activity even in oxidative conditions.

3. Temperature control: In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the PtNi catalyst more effectively suppresses temperature increases at the catalyst bed inlet. This is due to the overlap of exothermic combustion and endothermic reforming reaction zones, enabled by the high reducibility of the catalyst.

These findings provide valuable insights into the structure-performance relationships of bimetallic catalysts. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these reactor study results with model surfaces and supported catalysts by:

1. Investigating the surface segregation of Pt atoms on PtNi alloy surfaces under various conditions.
2. Studying the adsorption and reaction behavior of methane, oxygen, and steam on these model surfaces.
3. Examining the oxidation state changes of Ni in the presence of Pt under reaction-like conditions.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, such as challenges in creating well-defined alloy surfaces and maintaining them under reaction conditions, may need to be addressed to fully bridge the gap between reactor studies and surface science investigations.

通过序列浸渍法制备的PtNi催化剂形成了表面富Pt原子的PtNi合金粒子。这种结构大大提高了Ni的还原性，导致了几个有益的效果：

1. 消除滞后现象：与Ni催化剂或通过共浸渍法制备的PtNi催化剂不同，序列浸渍的PtNi催化剂在添加和移除甲烷-氧气混合物时不显示滞后现象。这表明在不同反应条件下性能稳定。

2. 抑制深度氧化：PtNi合金粒子的高还原性防止了Ni物种的深度氧化，即使在氧化条件下也能保持催化活性。

3. 温度控制：在甲烷的氧化蒸汽重整中，PtNi催化剂更有效地抑制了催化剂床入口处的温度升高。这是由于催化剂的高还原性使放热燃烧反应区与吸热重整反应区重叠所致。

这些发现为双金属催化剂的结构-性能关系提供了宝贵的见解。未来的UHV研究可能通过以下方式将这些反应器研究结果与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联：

1. 研究不同条件下PtNi合金表面上Pt原子的表面偏析。
2. 研究甲烷、氧气和水蒸气在这些模型表面上的吸附和反应行为。
3. 在类似反应条件下，检查Pt存在下Ni的氧化态变化。

然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究中存在的限制，如创建良好定义的合金表面和在反应条件下维持这些表面的挑战，可能需要解决，以完全弥合反应器研究和表面科学调查之间的差距。
