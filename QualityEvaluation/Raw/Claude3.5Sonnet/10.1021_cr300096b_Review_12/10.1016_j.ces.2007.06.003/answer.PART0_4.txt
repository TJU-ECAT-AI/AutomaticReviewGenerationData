[1] "Effects of methane oxygen mixture addition to steam reforming of methane and subsequent removal of the methane oxygen mixture from the oxidative steam reforming of methane on catalytic performance were investigated using monometallic Ni and Pt catalysts and two PtNi bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "Hysteresis with respect to the addition and removal of the methane oxygen mixture was observed clearly on a PtNi bimetallic catalyst prepared by co-impregnation method and the Ni catalyst. In contrast, no hysteresis was observed for a PtNi catalyst that was prepared by sequential impregnation method."

[3] "PtNi catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation is formed PtNi alloy particles, where Pt atoms are segregated on the surface, enhances the reducibility of Ni drastically and this is related to the behavior without hysteresis."

[4] "Characterization of results using Pt L3-edge and Ni K-edge EXAFS analysis and FTIR of CO adsorption suggest that the PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated to the surface can be formed on the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6), which might be related to the lack of hysteresis behavior by high reducibility and the suppression of the deep oxidation of Ni species."

[5] "In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the temperature over the catalyst bed inlet is high. However, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase than other catalysts, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone."

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtNi catalysts, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversions in reactor studies. The study demonstrates that PtNi bimetallic catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation method show superior performance compared to monometallic Ni or Pt catalysts and PtNi catalysts prepared by co-impregnation.

The PtNi catalyst prepared by sequential impregnation forms PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated on the surface. This structure enhances the reducibility of Ni dramatically, leading to several beneficial effects:

1. Elimination of hysteresis: Unlike Ni catalysts or PtNi catalysts prepared by co-impregnation, the sequentially impregnated PtNi catalyst shows no hysteresis with respect to the addition and removal of methane-oxygen mixture. This indicates stable performance across different reaction conditions.

2. Suppression of deep oxidation: The high reducibility of the PtNi alloy particles prevents deep oxidation of Ni species, maintaining catalytic activity even in oxidative conditions.

3. Temperature control: In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the PtNi catalyst more effectively suppresses temperature increases at the catalyst bed inlet. This is due to the overlap of exothermic combustion and endothermic reforming reaction zones, enabled by the high reducibility of the catalyst.

These findings provide valuable insights into the structure-performance relationships of bimetallic catalysts. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these reactor study results with model surfaces and supported catalysts by:

1. Investigating the surface segregation of Pt atoms on PtNi alloy surfaces under various conditions.
2. Studying the adsorption and reaction behavior of methane, oxygen, and steam on these model surfaces.
3. Examining the oxidation state changes of Ni in the presence of Pt under reaction-like conditions.

However, current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, such as challenges in creating well-defined alloy surfaces and maintaining them under reaction conditions, may need to be addressed to fully bridge the gap between reactor studies and surface science investigations.

双金属Pt基催化剂，特别是PtNi催化剂，显著影响了反应器研究中甲烷转化的机理和效率。研究表明，通过序列浸渍法制备的PtNi双金属催化剂比单金属Ni或Pt催化剂以及通过共浸渍法制备的PtNi催化剂表现出更优越的性能。

通过序列浸渍法制备的PtNi催化剂形成了表面富Pt原子的PtNi合金粒子。这种结构大大提高了Ni的还原性，导致了几个有益的效果：

1. 消除滞后现象：与Ni催化剂或通过共浸渍法制备的PtNi催化剂不同，序列浸渍的PtNi催化剂在添加和移除甲烷-氧气混合物时不显示滞后现象。这表明在不同反应条件下性能稳定。

2. 抑制深度氧化：PtNi合金粒子的高还原性防止了Ni物种的深度氧化，即使在氧化条件下也能保持催化活性。

3. 温度控制：在甲烷的氧化蒸汽重整中，PtNi催化剂更有效地抑制了催化剂床入口处的温度升高。这是由于催化剂的高还原性使放热燃烧反应区与吸热重整反应区重叠所致。

这些发现为双金属催化剂的结构-性能关系提供了宝贵的见解。未来的UHV研究可能通过以下方式将这些反应器研究结果与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联：

1. 研究不同条件下PtNi合金表面上Pt原子的表面偏析。
2. 研究甲烷、氧气和水蒸气在这些模型表面上的吸附和反应行为。
3. 在类似反应条件下，检查Pt存在下Ni的氧化态变化。

然而，目前在Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究中存在的限制，如创建良好定义的合金表面和在反应条件下维持这些表面的挑战，可能需要解决，以完全弥合反应器研究和表面科学调查之间的差距。
