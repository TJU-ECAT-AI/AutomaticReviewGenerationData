[1] "For this study, we investigated the effect of added methane oxygen mixture (CH4/O2/Ar = 40/2x/60−2x; for x = 0 through 10) to steam reforming (CH4/H2O/Ar = 40/30/30) and the effect of methane oxygen mixture removal from oxidative steam reforming (CH4/H2O/O2/Ar = 40/30/20/10) on the catalytic performance and the bed temperature profile over monometallic Pt and Ni, and bimetallic PtNi catalysts."

[2] "Results show that the Ni(2.6) and Pt(0.1)+Ni(2.6) showed hysteresis between the steam reforming and the oxidative steam reforming. It is interpreted that the hysteresis can be caused by the deep oxidation of Ni species on the basis that metallic Ni species is the active site for the reforming reaction and the oxidized Ni species do not."

[3] "No hysteresis for the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) means that the deep oxidation of Ni is suppressed by the high reducibility of PtNi alloy particles, where Pt atoms are segregated on the particle surface. In addition, high reducibility can maintain the metallic state of Ni, even in the presence of oxygen."

[4] "Characterization of results using Pt LIII-edge and Ni K-edge EXAFS analysis and FTIR of CO adsorption suggest that the PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated to the surface can be formed on the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6), which might be related to the lack of hysteresis behavior by high reducibility and the suppression of the deep oxidation of Ni species."

The bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts, particularly those prepared by sequential impregnation (Pt/Ni), show improved performance in methane conversion reactions compared to monometallic Ni or co-impregnated Pt+Ni catalysts. 

The key mechanism appears to be the formation of PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated on the surface. This structure enhances the reducibility of Ni, allowing it to maintain its metallic state even in oxidizing conditions. As a result, the Pt/Ni catalyst shows no hysteresis between steam reforming and oxidative steam reforming, unlike Ni-only or co-impregnated catalysts.

The high reducibility of the Pt/Ni catalyst allows it to be active for both methane combustion and reforming reactions simultaneously. This overlap of reaction zones helps to suppress temperature increases in the catalyst bed, leading to more efficient and stable operation.

While the study does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions, the improved oxidation resistance and maintained metallic state of Ni in the Pt/Ni catalyst suggest potential benefits for these reactions as well.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by allowing detailed investigation of the surface structure and composition of these bimetallic catalysts. This could help correlate the observed reactor performance with specific surface properties, potentially leading to further catalyst optimizations. However, the current literature does not mention specific limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, so further research would be needed to identify and address these challenges.

双金属Pt-Ni催化剂，特别是通过序列浸渍法制备的(Pt/Ni)催化剂，在甲烷转化反应中表现出比单金属Ni或共浸渍Pt+Ni催化剂更好的性能。

关键机制似乎是形成了表面富集Pt原子的PtNi合金颗粒。这种结构增强了Ni的还原性，使其即使在氧化条件下也能保持金属态。因此，与仅含Ni或共浸渍催化剂不同，Pt/Ni催化剂在蒸汽重整和氧化蒸汽重整之间没有滞后现象。

Pt/Ni催化剂的高还原性使其能够同时催化甲烷燃烧和重整反应。反应区域的这种重叠有助于抑制催化剂床层的温度升高，从而实现更高效和稳定的操作。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及CO氧化或水煤气变换反应，但Pt/Ni催化剂改善的抗氧化性和维持的Ni金属态表明这些反应也可能受益。

未来的超高真空(UHV)研究可以通过允许详细调查这些双金属催化剂的表面结构和成分，提供有价值的见解。这可以帮助将观察到的反应器性能与特定的表面性质相关联，可能导致进一步的催化剂优化。然而，现有文献并未提及UHV研究Pt基双金属表面的具体限制，因此需要进一步研究来识别和解决这些挑战。
