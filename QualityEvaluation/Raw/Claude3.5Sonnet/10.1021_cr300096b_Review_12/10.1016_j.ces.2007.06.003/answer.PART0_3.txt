[1] "Effects of methane oxygen mixture addition to steam reforming of methane and subsequent removal of the methane oxygen mixture from the oxidative steam reforming of methane on catalytic performance were investigated using monometallic Ni and Pt catalysts and two PtNi bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "Hysteresis with respect to the addition and removal of the methane oxygen mixture was observed clearly on a PtNi bimetallic catalyst prepared by co-impregnation method and the Ni catalyst. In contrast, no hysteresis was observed for a PtNi catalyst that was prepared by sequential impregnation method."

[3] "PtNi catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation is formed PtNi alloy particles, where Pt atoms are segregated on the surface, enhances the reducibility of Ni drastically and this is related to the behavior without hysteresis."

[4] "Ni species on the Pt-segregated PtNi alloy particles have high reducibility; they can be maintained in the metallic state even in the presence of oxygen. These species can therefore be active for methane reforming as well as methane combustion, which can contribute to the overlap between the reaction zones of the reforming and combustion."

Bimetallic PtNi catalysts, particularly those prepared by sequential impregnation, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of methane conversions in reactor studies. These catalysts form PtNi alloy particles with Pt atoms segregated on the surface, which enhances the reducibility of Ni and prevents hysteresis during oxidative steam reforming of methane.

The high reducibility of Ni species on Pt-segregated PtNi alloy particles allows them to remain in a metallic state even in the presence of oxygen. This enables them to be active for both methane reforming and combustion simultaneously, leading to an overlap of reaction zones and improved efficiency.

The literature does not provide specific information on CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions with these catalysts. Additionally, it does not discuss potential insights from UHV studies or correlations with model surfaces and supported catalysts. Future UHV studies could potentially provide valuable information on the surface chemistry and atomic-scale interactions of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, which could help explain the observed reactor-scale phenomena and guide the design of more efficient catalysts.

双金属PtNi催化剂，特别是通过序贯浸渍法制备的催化剂，显著影响了反应器研究中甲烷转化的机理和效率。这些催化剂形成了表面富集Pt原子的PtNi合金颗粒，大大提高了Ni的还原性，并防止了在甲烷氧化重整过程中出现滞后现象。

Pt富集的PtNi合金颗粒上的Ni物种具有高还原性，即使在有氧存在的情况下也能保持金属态。这使得它们能够同时活跃于甲烷重整和燃烧反应，导致反应区域重叠，提高了效率。

文献中没有提供这些催化剂在CO氧化或水煤气变换反应方面的具体信息。此外，也没有讨论超高真空(UHV)研究可能提供的见解或与模型表面和负载催化剂的相关性。未来的UHV研究可能会提供有关Pt基双金属催化剂表面化学和原子尺度相互作用的宝贵信息，这可能有助于解释观察到的反应器尺度现象，并指导设计更高效的催化剂。
