[1] "In the specific conditions of the exhausts (low temperature, 300400 C; presence of 1015% of H2O; large excess of O2, low CH4 concentrations, 5001000 ppm) Pd supported catalysts are widely recognized as the most active in CH4 combustion"

[2] "Some literature reports suggest that the addition of Pt to Pd-containing catalysts leads to an improvement of catalyst stability under reaction conditions with respect to the Pd monometallic catalyst."

[3] "However, the influence of Pt on the catalytic activity of PdPt bimetallic catalysts is still a debated issue. Some authors claim that the addition of platinum to palladium results in increasing catalytic activity while for others the effect of Pt is not straightforward."

[4] "As a whole, the effect of Pt on PdO CH4 combustion activity is not straightforward. Depending on several factors, such as the extent of PdO formation, the strength of Pdsupport interactions, the stabilization of metallic Pd, Pt may act as an inhibitor or a promoter of catalytic activity."

The literature provides some insights on how bimetallic Pt-Pd catalysts influence methane combustion, but does not directly address CO oxidation or water-gas shift reactions. For methane combustion:

1. Pd-supported catalysts are generally recognized as most active for methane combustion under typical exhaust conditions.

2. Adding Pt to Pd catalysts can improve stability under reaction conditions compared to monometallic Pd catalysts. 

3. However, the effect of Pt on catalytic activity is debated. Some studies show increased activity, while others find the effect is not straightforward.

4. The influence of Pt depends on factors like PdO formation, Pd-support interactions, and metallic Pd stabilization. Pt can act as either a promoter or inhibitor of activity depending on these factors.

The document does not provide information on UHV studies or correlations with model surfaces for these reactions. To gain further insights, future UHV studies could examine:

- Surface compositions and structures of Pt-Pd bimetallic model catalysts
- Adsorption and reaction of methane, CO, and water on these surfaces
- Effects of oxidation state and support interactions
- Comparisons to supported nanoparticle catalysts

Such studies could help elucidate the fundamental mechanisms behind the complex effects observed in reactor studies of bimetallic catalysts.

该文献对Pt-Pd双金属催化剂如何影响甲烷燃烧提供了一些见解,但没有直接涉及CO氧化或水煤气变换反应。对于甲烷燃烧:

1. 在典型的尾气条件下,Pd负载的催化剂通常被认为是甲烷燃烧最活跃的催化剂。

2. 在Pd催化剂中添加Pt可以改善其在反应条件下的稳定性,相比于单金属Pd催化剂。

3. 然而,Pt对催化活性的影响还存在争议。一些研究表明活性增加,而其他研究发现效果并不直接。

4. Pt的影响取决于PdO的形成程度、Pd与载体的相互作用以及金属Pd的稳定化等因素。根据这些因素,Pt可以作为活性的促进剂或抑制剂。

该文档没有提供关于UHV研究或与这些反应的模型表面相关性的信息。为了获得进一步的见解,未来的UHV研究可以考察:

- Pt-Pd双金属模型催化剂的表面组成和结构
- 甲烷、CO和水在这些表面上的吸附和反应
- 氧化状态和载体相互作用的影响
- 与负载型纳米颗粒催化剂的比较

这些研究可以帮助阐明双金属催化剂反应器研究中观察到的复杂效应背后的基本机制。
