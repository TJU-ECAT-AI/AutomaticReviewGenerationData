[1] "Addition of Pt progressively promotes thermal decomposition and chemical reduction (by CH4) of PdO. On increasing the Pt/Pd ratio oxidation of metallic Pd is also progressively inhibited, being completely hindered for the Pt/Pd-1 sample."

[2] "Pt inhibiting effect on palladium re-oxidation also affects reactivation dynamics, which is progressively slower the higher is the Pt/Pd ratio."

[3] "The correlation of PdO reducibility to CH4 combustion activity which is observed in monometallic catalyst, in line with a redox mechanism kinetically controlled by the reduction step, does not apply in the case of bimetallic samples."

[4] "As a whole, the effect of Pt on PdO CH4 combustion activity is not straightforward. Depending on several factors, such as the extent of PdO formation, the strength of Pdsupport interactions, the stabilization of metallic Pd, Pt may act as an inhibitor or a promoter of catalytic activity."

Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts influence methane conversion mechanisms and efficiencies in complex ways:

1. Pt promotes PdO thermal decomposition and chemical reduction by CH4, while inhibiting Pd re-oxidation. This affects the redox behavior crucial for catalytic activity.

2. Higher Pt content slows reactivation dynamics due to inhibited Pd re-oxidation.

3. Unlike monometallic Pd catalysts, PdO reducibility does not directly correlate with CH4 combustion activity in bimetallic samples. This suggests different reaction mechanisms.

4. Pt's effect on CH4 combustion is complex, potentially acting as an inhibitor or promoter depending on factors like PdO formation extent, metal-support interactions, and metallic Pd stabilization.

The literature does not discuss CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions, nor does it mention UHV studies. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights by:

1. Investigating surface interactions between Pt and Pd atoms on model surfaces.
2. Examining CH4 adsorption and dissociation on bimetallic surfaces under controlled conditions.
3. Studying the oxidation state changes of Pd and Pt during reaction cycles.

These UHV studies could help correlate the observed reactor behaviors with fundamental surface processes, bridging the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts.

铂基双金属催化剂以复杂的方式影响甲烷转化机理和效率：

1. 铂促进PdO的热分解和被CH4化学还原，同时抑制Pd的再氧化。这影响了对催化活性至关重要的氧化还原行为。

2. 更高的铂含量会由于抑制Pd再氧化而减缓再活化动力学。

3. 与单金属钯催化剂不同，在双金属样品中PdO的可还原性与CH4燃烧活性并不直接相关。这表明存在不同的反应机理。

4. 铂对CH4燃烧的影响是复杂的，根据PdO形成程度、金属-载体相互作用和金属钯稳定性等因素，可能起抑制剂或促进剂的作用。

文献没有讨论CO氧化或水气变换反应，也没有提到UHV研究。未来的UHV研究可能通过以下方式提供见解：

1. 研究模型表面上铂和钯原子之间的表面相互作用。
2. 在受控条件下研究CH4在双金属表面上的吸附和解离。
3. 研究反应循环中钯和铂的氧化态变化。

这些UHV研究可以帮助将观察到的反应器行为与基本表面过程相关联，从而弥合模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距。
