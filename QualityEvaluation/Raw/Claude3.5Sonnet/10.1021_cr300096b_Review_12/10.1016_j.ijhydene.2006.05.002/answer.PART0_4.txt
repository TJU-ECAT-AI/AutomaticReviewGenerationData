[1] "Many studies have been made on the approach of combinatorial catalysis especially Pt and Pd for CO oxidation reaction [10]. Using bimetallic system is an attractive alternative that appears to enhance some properties of the catalyst or some synergistic effect as electronic effect/geometry effect. Although it is still not yet well understood, it has been established that the bimetallic system improves both activity and selectivity of a great number of reactions [11,12]."

[2] "The catalytic activity was obviously increased with the increasing content of Pd. However, the results at a ratio of Pt: Pd = 1: 9 evidenced that it was not necessary to load Pd in very high loadings. The catalyst with a ratio of Pt: Pd = 1: 7 showed the best performance, 76% CO conversion and 55% selectivity and at 90.110 C."

[3] "When increasing the O2 concentration to twice the stoichiometric ratio of the oxygen concentration (1% O2 ), the CO conversion increased to 76% at 90.110 C. Ninty nine percent CO conversion of 1% CO at 90 C can be achieved by increasing the oxygen concentration to 2%."

[4] "An enhancement of CO oxidation reaction can be apparently observed when adding 10% water vapor in the feed. At 90 C, when there was no water vapor in the feed stream the CO conversion was about 76% and when adding 10% water vapor in the feed stream the CO conversion was increased to 85%."

[5] "The CO conversion substantially dropped from 76% to 50% at 90.110 C when increasing CO2 concentration in the feed stream. The presence of CO2 also affected the selectivity in the temperature range of 50.190 C."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-Pd systems, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation. The literature shows that these bimetallic systems can enhance catalyst properties and produce synergistic effects, improving both activity and selectivity for various reactions, including CO oxidation.

For CO oxidation, the Pt-Pd bimetallic catalyst showed increased activity with higher Pd content, with an optimal Pt:Pd ratio of 1:7 achieving 76% CO conversion and 55% selectivity at 90-110°C. This suggests that the bimetallic composition affects the reaction kinetics and efficiency.

The study also demonstrated that increasing oxygen concentration improved CO conversion, with 99% conversion achieved at 2% O2 concentration. This indicates that the bimetallic catalyst's performance is sensitive to reactant concentrations.

Water vapor in the feed stream enhanced CO oxidation, increasing conversion from 76% to 85% at 90°C with 10% water vapor. This suggests that the bimetallic catalyst may facilitate the water-gas shift reaction or promote the formation of more reactive hydroxyl groups.

CO2 in the feed stream negatively impacted catalyst performance, reducing CO conversion from 76% to 50% when CO2 concentration increased. This could be due to the reverse water-gas shift reaction or carbonate formation on the catalyst surface.

While the current study provides valuable insights into reactor-scale performance, future UHV studies could help correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts. Such studies could elucidate the specific roles of Pt and Pd in the bimetallic system, investigate surface species and intermediates, and provide atomic-scale understanding of the reaction mechanisms. This could potentially explain the observed effects of reactant concentrations, water vapor, and CO2 on catalyst performance. However, conducting UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces presents challenges, which currently limit the direct correlation between reactor studies and model surface investigations.

双金属催化剂，特别是Pt-Pd系统，显著影响了CO氧化的机理和效率。文献表明，这些双金属系统可以增强催化剂的性能并产生协同效应，提高各种反应（包括CO氧化）的活性和选择性。

对于CO氧化，Pt-Pd双金属催化剂随着Pd含量的增加而表现出更高的活性，最佳Pt:Pd比例为1:7，在90-110°C下实现了76%的CO转化率和55%的选择性。这表明双金属组成影响反应动力学和效率。

研究还表明，增加氧气浓度可以提高CO转化率，在2%的O2浓度下达到99%的转化率。这表明双金属催化剂的性能对反应物浓度敏感。

进料中的水蒸气增强了CO氧化，在90°C下，10%的水蒸气使转化率从76%提高到85%。这表明双金属催化剂可能促进水气变换反应或促进更活性羟基的形成。

进料中的CO2对催化剂性能产生负面影响，当CO2浓度增加时，CO转化率从76%降至50%。这可能是由于逆水气变换反应或在催化剂表面形成碳酸盐所致。

虽然当前研究为反应器规模的性能提供了宝贵的见解，但未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可以帮助将这些发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联。这些研究可以阐明Pt和Pd在双金属系统中的具体作用，研究表面物种和中间体，并提供对反应机理的原子尺度理解。这可能解释反应物浓度、水蒸气和CO2对催化剂性能的观察到的影响。然而，在Pt基双金属表面上进行UHV研究存在挑战，这目前限制了反应器研究和模型表面研究之间的直接关联。
