[1] "Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are also quite largely used as dehydrogenation catalysts such as in the Oleflex light paraffin dehydrogenation technology and in the Pacol long linear paraffin dehydrogenation technology, both from UOP"

[2] "The activity of the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst does not present significant modifications with respect to the monometallic Ni catalyst. The conversion of both methane and CO2 is maximum for the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst."

[3] "It is evident that some kind of synergy occurs between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, improving DRM activity, in terms of conversion. Thus, these elements have a mutual role of activators for each other."

[4] "However, the most relevant effect that can also have practical application is that the addition of small amounts of Pt significantly decreases the deactivation rate of the catalyst (as discussed in detail elsewhere [28]) by reducing the formation of carbon nanotubes."

The bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts show synergistic effects that improve dry reforming of methane (DRM) activity compared to monometallic catalysts. Specifically:

1. The 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst showed maximum conversion of both methane and CO2, indicating improved efficiency for DRM. 

2. Adding small amounts of Pt to Ni catalysts significantly decreased catalyst deactivation by reducing carbon nanotube formation. This improves catalyst stability and lifetime.

3. Pt and Ni appear to mutually activate each other when combined on an alumina support, enhancing overall catalytic performance.

4. The synergy likely stems from changes in metal particle size, reducibility, and surface composition in the bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic versions.

While this study focused on DRM, the synergistic effects could potentially extend to other reactions like CO oxidation and water-gas shift. Future UHV studies on model Pt-Ni surfaces could help elucidate the atomic-scale origins of these synergistic effects by allowing detailed characterization of surface structure, composition, and adsorption properties. This could provide insights to correlate with the reactor studies on supported catalysts. However, preparing and studying well-defined bimetallic surfaces in UHV remains challenging.

双金属Pt-Ni催化剂显示出协同效应,可提高甲烷干重整(DRM)活性,相比单金属催化剂表现更佳。具体来说:

1. 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3催化剂显示出最高的甲烷和CO2转化率,表明其在DRM反应中的效率得到了提高。

2. 向Ni催化剂中添加少量Pt可显著降低催化剂失活率,减少碳纳米管的形成。这提高了催化剂的稳定性和使用寿命。

3. 当Pt和Ni结合在氧化铝载体上时,似乎可以相互激活,从而提高整体催化性能。

4. 这种协同效应可能源于双金属催化剂中金属粒子尺寸、可还原性和表面组成的变化,与单金属版本相比有所不同。

虽然这项研究集中在DRM反应上,但这种协同效应可能也适用于其他反应,如CO氧化和水煤气变换反应。未来在模型Pt-Ni表面上进行的超高真空(UHV)研究可以帮助阐明这些协同效应的原子尺度起源,通过允许对表面结构、组成和吸附性质进行详细表征。这可以为支撑催化剂的反应器研究提供相关性见解。然而,在UHV条件下制备和研究明确定义的双金属表面仍然具有挑战性。
