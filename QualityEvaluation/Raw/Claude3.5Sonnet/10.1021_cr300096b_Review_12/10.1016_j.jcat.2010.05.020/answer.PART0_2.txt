[1] "The catalytic data reported here show that the monometallic 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is slightly more active than the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the dry reforming of methane, in spite of the smaller metal content, in agreement with the intrinsically higher activity of platinum with respect to nickel in the reaction."

[2] "However, an improvement in the catalyst activity can be obtained not only by introducing a small amount of Pt on the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst) but also adding a significant amount of Ni to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst)."

[3] "It is evident that some kind of synergy occurs between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, improving DRM activity, in terms of conversion."

[4] "However, the most relevant effect that can also have practical application is that the addition of small amounts of Pt significantly decreases the deactivation rate of the catalyst (as discussed in detail elsewhere [28]) by reducing the formation of carbon nanotubes."

[5] "IR spectra of adsorbed CO confirm that a solid solution occurs, indicating that the surface appears to be dominated by Pt centers whose electron-withdrawing character is increased by nickel."

The bimetallic PtNi catalysts show synergistic effects that improve dry reforming of methane (DRM) activity compared to monometallic Pt or Ni catalysts. Adding small amounts of Pt to Ni/Al2O3 catalysts or Ni to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts enhances catalytic activity. The most significant effect is that adding small amounts of Pt to Ni catalysts decreases deactivation by reducing carbon nanotube formation.

The PtNi alloy formation results in Pt-dominated surfaces with increased electron-withdrawing character of Pt centers due to Ni. This modification of the electronic properties likely contributes to the improved catalytic performance.

The document does not provide specific information on CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions for these catalysts. It also does not discuss potential insights from UHV studies. To fully address the question, additional studies comparing reactor and UHV results for these reactions on PtNi bimetallic surfaces would be needed.

双金属PtNi催化剂表现出协同效应,相比单金属Pt或Ni催化剂,改善了甲烷干重整(DRM)活性。向Ni/Al2O3催化剂中添加少量Pt或向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加Ni都能提高催化活性。最显著的效果是向Ni催化剂中添加少量Pt可以通过减少碳纳米管的形成来降低失活率。

PtNi合金的形成导致表面以Pt为主,由于Ni的存在,Pt中心的吸电子性增强。这种电子性质的改变可能是催化性能改善的原因。

该文献未提供这些催化剂在CO氧化或水煤气变换反应方面的具体信息。它也没有讨论UHV研究可能带来的见解。要全面回答这个问题,需要进行额外的研究,比较PtNi双金属表面在反应器和UHV条件下这些反应的结果。
