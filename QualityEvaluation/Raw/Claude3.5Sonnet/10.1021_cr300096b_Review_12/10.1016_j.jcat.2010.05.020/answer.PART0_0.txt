[1] "The catalytic data reported here show that the monometallic 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is slightly more active than the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the dry reforming of methane, in spite of the smaller metal content, in agreement with the intrinsically higher activity of platinum with respect to nickel in the reaction."

[2] "However, an improvement in the catalyst activity can be obtained not only by introducing a small amount of Pt on the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst) but also adding a significant amount of Ni to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst)."

[3] "It is evident that some kind of synergy occurs between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, improving DRM activity, in terms of conversion. Thus, these elements have a mutual role of activators for each other."

[4] "However, the most relevant effect that can also have practical application is that the addition of small amounts of Pt significantly decreases the deactivation rate of the catalyst (as discussed in detail elsewhere [28]) by reducing the formation of carbon nanotubes."

[5] "IR spectra of adsorbed CO confirm that a solid solution occurs, indicating that the surface appears to be dominated by Pt centers whose electron-withdrawing character is increased by nickel."

Based on the provided literature, bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of methane dry reforming in several ways:

1. They exhibit synergistic effects, improving catalytic activity compared to monometallic Ni or Pt catalysts. The bimetallic catalysts show higher conversion rates in dry reforming of methane.

2. The addition of small amounts of Pt to Ni/Al2O3 catalysts significantly decreases the deactivation rate by reducing the formation of carbon nanotubes. This enhances catalyst stability and lifetime.

3. The bimetallic catalysts form a solid solution, with the surface dominated by Pt centers. The presence of Ni increases the electron-withdrawing character of these Pt centers, which likely affects their catalytic properties.

4. The formation of smaller metal particles in bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic ones increases the electron-withdrawing ability of Pt centers, potentially enhancing their catalytic activity.

While the literature does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reaction, it suggests that similar synergistic effects might be observed in these reactions as well.

Future UHV studies could provide insights into:

1. The surface composition and structure of Pt-Ni alloys under reaction conditions.
2. The electronic properties of Pt centers in the presence of Ni and how they correlate with catalytic activity.
3. The mechanism of carbon nanotube formation inhibition by Pt in bimetallic catalysts.
4. The role of particle size in determining catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces.

These UHV studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the structure-activity relationships in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.

根据提供的文献，Pt-Ni双金属催化剂以几种方式影响甲烷干重整的机理和效率：

1. 它们表现出协同效应，与单金属Ni或Pt催化剂相比，提高了催化活性。双金属催化剂在甲烷干重整中显示出更高的转化率。

2. 向Ni/Al2O3催化剂中添加少量Pt可显著降低失活率，减少碳纳米管的形成。这提高了催化剂的稳定性和使用寿命。

3. 双金属催化剂形成固溶体，表面以Pt中心为主。Ni的存在增加了这些Pt中心的吸电子性，这可能影响其催化性能。

4. 与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂形成的金属颗粒更小，增加了Pt中心的吸电子能力，可能增强其催化活性。

虽然文献没有直接涉及CO氧化或水煤气变换反应，但它暗示这些反应中可能也会观察到类似的协同效应。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可以提供以下见解：

1. 反应条件下Pt-Ni合金的表面组成和结构。
2. Ni存在下Pt中心的电子性质，以及它们与催化活性的相关性。
3. Pt在双金属催化剂中抑制碳纳米管形成的机理。
4. 粒子尺寸在决定双金属表面催化性能中的作用。

这些UHV研究可以帮助弥合模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距，为Pt基双金属催化剂的结构-活性关系提供更全面的理解。
