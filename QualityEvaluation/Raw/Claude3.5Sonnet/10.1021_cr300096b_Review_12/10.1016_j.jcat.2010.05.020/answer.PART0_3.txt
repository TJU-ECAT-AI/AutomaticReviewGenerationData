[1] "Bimetallic PtNi catalysts supported on a nanostructured γ-Al2O3 together with the corresponding monometallic materials, employed for the dry reforming of methane, have been prepared and characterized."

[2] "IR spectra of adsorbed CO indicate that the surface of the PtNi catalysts is dominated by Pt centers, whose electron-withdrawing character is increased by Ni."

[3] "It has also been confirmed the formation of PtNi alloy, which is enriched at the surface by Pt and has smaller metal crystal size than metal particles in monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts."

[4] "The alloy formation is associated with higher activity and lower production of carbonaceous materials upon dry reforming of methane."

[5] "The addition of platinum, however, favors the formation of even smaller metal particles with respect to pure nickel, thus increasing significantly the electron-withdrawing ability of Pt centers."

The literature provides insights into how bimetallic PtNi catalysts influence methane dry reforming, but does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions. For methane dry reforming:

1. Bimetallic PtNi catalysts show higher activity and lower carbon formation compared to monometallic catalysts.

2. The surface of PtNi catalysts is dominated by Pt, with Ni increasing the electron-withdrawing character of Pt centers.

3. PtNi alloy formation results in smaller metal crystal sizes compared to monometallic catalysts.

4. Addition of Pt to Ni catalysts increases Ni reducibility and enhances catalyst stability.

The literature does not provide information on potential insights from future UHV studies. To fully answer the question, additional research on CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and UHV studies of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces would be necessary.

这篇文献提供了双金属PtNi催化剂如何影响甲烷干重整的见解,但没有直接涉及CO氧化或水气变换反应。对于甲烷干重整:

1. 与单金属催化剂相比,双金属PtNi催化剂表现出更高的活性和更少的碳形成。

2. PtNi催化剂的表面主要由Pt主导,Ni增加了Pt中心的吸电子特性。

3. PtNi合金的形成导致金属晶体尺寸比单金属催化剂更小。

4. 向Ni催化剂中添加Pt可以提高Ni的还原性并增强催化剂的稳定性。

文献没有提供关于未来UHV研究可能带来的见解的信息。要全面回答这个问题,需要对CO氧化、水气变换反应以及Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究进行额外的研究。
