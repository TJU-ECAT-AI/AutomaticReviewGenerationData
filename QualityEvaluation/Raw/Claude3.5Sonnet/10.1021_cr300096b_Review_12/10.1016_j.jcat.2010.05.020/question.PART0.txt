Characterization of alumina-supported Pt, Ni and PtNi alloy catalysts for the dry reforming of methane
Abstract
Two bimetallic PtNi catalysts supported on a nanostructured γ-Al2O3 together with the corresponding monometallic materials, employed for the dry reforming of methane, have been prepared and characterized. Characterization of the catalysts, in reduced form, has been performed by FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide at low and room temperature. XRD, TEM and XPS analysis have also been performed. IR spectra of adsorbed CO indicate that the surface of the PtNi catalysts is dominated by Pt centers, whose electron-withdrawing character is increased by Ni. It has also been confirmed the formation of PtNi alloy, which is enriched at the surface by Pt and has smaller metal crystal size than metal particles in monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts. The alloy formation is associated with higher activity and lower production of carbonaceous materials upon dry reforming of methane.

1. Introduction
Hydrogen is mostly produced today through steam reforming of hydrocarbons, usually natural gas
[1]
,
[2]
, performed at 10001200 K. The industrial catalysts are invariably based on Ni supported on an alumina-based carrier, usually stabilized by the presence of alkali and/or alkali earth cations
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
. These catalysts can be prepared by different methods such as impregnation of pre-synthesized supports or by different coprecipitation procedures
[3]
,
[4]
. Slow coking of these catalysts gives rise to deactivation, although regeneration is possible. These catalysts, however, are reported to be rapidly irreversibly deactivated in case of daily start-up and shut-down operation, typical in case of hydrogen and fuel cells domestic use. In this case, Ni catalysts doped with small amounts of noble metals are reported to display an intelligent behavior, with suppression of such deactivation phenomena
[5]
.
Similar Ni-based catalysts are also proposed for the development of processes for the production of hydrogen from renewables
[6]
such as bioethanol
[7]
,

[9]
,
[10]
,
[11]
, acetic acid
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
and glycerol
[15]
, which would result in the release of the energy production from fossil fuels and, simultaneously, in the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. However, at least in the case of ethanol steam reforming, cobaltnickel bimetallic catalysts appear to be more efficient than Ni catalysts
[16]
,
[17]
.
The production of low H2/CO ratio syngases through the dry reforming of methane, i.e. the reaction of methane with carbon dioxide, is also a potentially useful process. Coking in this case is a more serious problem, and for this reason, noble metal catalysts, which suffer coking less than Ni-based ones, have longer life
[18]
,
[19]
,
[20]
. Also in this case, bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-doped Ni catalysts, may have optimal behavior
[21]
.
Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are also quite largely used as dehydrogenation catalysts such as in the Oleflex light paraffin dehydrogenation technology and in the Pacol long linear paraffin dehydrogenation technology, both from UOP
[22]
. Similar catalysts are used in the hydrogenation reactions, e.g. for isooctene hydrogenation to isooctane and dearomatization reactions
[23]
, as well as in the BenSat benzene saturation technology from UOP
[24]
. In contrast, Ni/Al2O3 catalysts find large industrial application as hydrogenation catalysts such as for methanation and substitute natural gas synthesis
[25]
,
[26]
, as well as for the dearomatization and desulfurization of hydrocarbon feeds. In general, one of the reasons of choice between Pt- and Ni-based catalysts is the resistance to sulfur compounds, rather than their catalytic activity.
In this work, two bimetallic combinations of PtNi have been prepared, supported over nanostructured γ-Al2O3 together with the corresponding monometallic materials. These catalysts have been characterized for their metal particle size and metal textural properties (with respect to the pure support and the corresponding monometallic materials). This work is part of an investigation aimed at the development of efficient catalysts for syngas production by methane dry reforming.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
A synthesized nanostructured γ-Al2O3 was employed as support. The nanostructured alumina was prepared using NaAlO2 as precursor. An aqueous NaAlO2 solution was added dropwise to 5 N acetic acid solution. The precipitate obtained was decanted, filtered and washed with water. The resulting powder was dried overnight at 100 C and subsequently mixed with a non-ionic surfactant (Tergitol 15-TS-5, Sigma) using a Tergitol/Al ratio of 0.5. The mixture was maintained in an autoclave for 72 h at 100 C and later calcined at 500 C for 20 h. Before the catalysts preparation, the support was calcined in air at 800 C for 2 h (10 C/min).
Bimetallic supported catalysts (Pt [0.04, 0.4 at/nm2]Ni [4 at/nm2], corresponding to 0.4 or 4 wt% Pt, 10 wt% Ni) denoted as xPt4Ni/Al2O3, where x is the Pt load (expressed in terms of calculated virtual atomic superficial density), were prepared by simultaneous incipient wetness impregnation of the support, with a solution of diaminedinitroplatinum and/or nickel nitrate. The impregnation was done in a single step. The support impregnated was dried at 100 C for 2 h and calcined at 600 C for 2 h (10 C/min). Monometallic catalysts (Pt [0.4 at/nm2], corresponding to 4 wt% Pt, and Ni [4 at/nm2], corresponding to 10 wt% Ni; denoted as 0.4Pt/Al2O3 and 4Ni/Al2O3, respectively) were also prepared. In

2.2. Catalytic measurements
Reactivity experiments were carried out in a Microactivity-Reference reaction system from PID Eng&Tech (Spain) at atmospheric pressure (650700 C). A tubular fixed-bed stainless steel reactor (i.d. 9 mm) with 100 mg of catalyst (250420 μm) was employed. The total gas flow rate was kept constant at 50 Ncm3/min with composition: CH4/CO2/He = 20/20/60. The space velocity and the contact time were 6000 h1 and 0.8 g h mol1, respectively, operating under plug flow conditions. Preliminary reactivity tests with different catalyst particle sizes and dilutions, measuring the radial and axial temperatures at different points, were performed to confirm the non-existence of heat or mass transfer limitations. Before reaction, catalysts were activated in situ with H2 (3% in He, 30 Ncm3 min1) at 700 C for 2 h. The reaction temperature was measured with a thermocouple placed in the reactor bed. The reactor effluent was analyzed by GC (Agilent 4890D) equipped with TCD and FID detectors. Stability runs were performed at 700 C, where the highest formation of carbon is expected.
2.3. Catalysts characterization
FTIR spectra of self-supporting catalyst disks have been recorded by a Thermofisher 380 Instrument. Pure powders have been reduced in hydrogen at 773 K and outgassed at the same temperature before each adsorption experiment. CO adsorption has been performed both at room temperature and liquid nitrogen temperature. These experiments could not be done with Ni-containing spent catalysts because of the carbonaceous material that hinders the preparation of thin pressed disks and causes full absorption of the IR light.
X-ray powder diffraction data have been recorded with an XPert MPD PRO diffractometer (PANalytical) using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.54059 Å) and a Ge (1 1 1) primary monochromator. The X-ray tube worked at 45 kV and 35 mA. The measurements were done from 20 to 70 (2θ).
The carbon content of the catalysts after reaction was obtained via elemental analysis technique using an Elemental Analyzer Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN.
Photoelectron spectra were recorded over fresh samples using a Physical Electronic 5700 spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer operating with a Mg Kα X-ray exciting source (1253.6 eV, 15 kV, 300 W). The binding energies (BE) were referenced to the C1s peak, used as an internal patron for calibration and fixed at 284.8 eV considering a deviation 0.2 eV. All deconvolutions of experimental curves were done with Gaussian and Lorenzian line fitting, minimizing the (χ2) chi-square values. The references values were taken from the NIST X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy database
[27]
.
TEM images were taken with a Philips CM 200 of 200 kV, coupled with EDX microanalysis; the samples were prepared using ethanol as dispersant.
3. Results
3.1. Catalytic activity measurements
The activity of the catalysts has been described in detail in
[28]
. The CO2 and CH4 conversion values obtained with the catalyst at 650 C and at 700 C are presented in
Table 2
. The CO2 conversion values are higher than those of methane, due to the presence of side reactions, such as the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction. In agreement with this, the H2/CO ratio values reached with all of the catalysts are similar, between 0.64 and 0.68 (
Table 2
). The activity of the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst does not present significant modifications with respect to the monometallic Ni catalyst. The conversion of both methane and CO2 is maximum for the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst.

In
Table 2
, the CO2 conversion loss expressed as conversion loss per hour of time-on-stream (% h1) over the catalysts under study working at 700 C are also shown, as a rough measure of deactivation kinetics. It is evident that the deactivation rate decreases strongly by the addition of Pt to Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Indeed, the Pt-containing catalysts supported on the fibrous alumina are rather stable for the DRM. This is in agreement with literature data showing that on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, carbon is removed by oxidation by CO2
[29]
, ensuring a longer accessibility to active Pt sites.
3.2. XRD patterns
In
Fig. 1
, the XRD patterns of the samples under study, after reaction in methane dry reforming, are reported. Here, a slightly different interpretation of the XRD pattern is reported with respect to the previous one
[28]
. In both cases of pure supported metal catalysts, the XRD diffraction peaks of the corresponding face-centered cubic phase (cF4, space group Fm 3m) are observed, as expected indeed. In particular, we observe the [1 1 1] and the [2 0 0] peaks for both pure phases, whose position is reported in
Table 3
. Also, in the case of sample 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3, the peaks of metallic Ni are evident, apparently not shifted, but lowered in intensity and broadened very much. This is an indication of the formation of smaller crystals, as deduced by the crystal size calculation made using the Scherrer equation. In the case of the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 sample, the [1 1 1] and [2 0 0] peaks of nickel metal are very much broadened but also definitely displaced to lower 2θ values. This corresponds to a further important lowering of the crystal size but also to a modification of the unit cell dimensions. From the position of the [2 0 0], peak is possible to calculate that the increase in the Ni fcc unit cell dimension in the case of the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 sample is roughly 10% the difference between the cell dimensions of the Pt and Ni monometallic catalysts, which is in rough agreement with the Vegards law for substitutional solid solutions, taking into account that the Pt molar fraction of this sample is 0.09 (assuming both Pt and Ni fully reduced and excluding alumina). These data show that in the case of the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 sample, a fcc substitutional solid solution is formed. In fact, it is well known that a partial solubility exists at temperatures below 900 K in the fcc phase between Ni and Pt. The solubility of Pt in Ni fcc decreases by decreasing temperature being near 15% mol at 650 K
[30]
. At higher Pt contents, three different intermetallic phases become thermodynamically stable, Ni3Pt, NiPt and NiPt3. The composition of the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 sample is near the limit of thermodynamic stability of the disordered fcc solid solution at r.t. On the other hand, in our experimental conditions, the disordered fcc solid solution can be distinguished with difficulty from the ordered Ni3Pt intermetallic phase (Cu3Au-type, L12 structure; space group Pm 3m). In fact, the weak superlattice [1 1 0], [2 1 0] and [2 1 1] peaks (not found in our XRD pattern) are expected weak and further weakened and broadened due to the very small crystal size of such a metallic phase. The [1 1 1] and [2 0 0] interplanar distances we measure here for the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 sample (
Table 3
) are smaller than those measured for Ni3Pt particles supported on silica
[31]
, suggesting that the NiPt ratio in this phase may be, in our case, larger than 3. The formation of NiPt alloys has already been determined by different techniques for silica-supported catalysts, where, depending on the composition, ordered PtNi intermetallic and disordered fcc solid solution were found to exist or coexist

Carbon content in spent catalysis, obtained by elemental analysis.
In the case of spent Ni-containing catalysts, an additional XRD peak is observed, which can be confidently assigned to graphitic carbon. In fact, it is well known that Ni-based catalysts tend to form carbonaceous materials under steam-reforming conditions, producing carbon whiskers or nanotubes
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
, as well as, possibly, other forms of carbonaceous materials. It is evident from the XRD pattern that the amount of graphitic carbon strongly decreases by adding Pt to Ni on the catalyst, in agreement with the carbon content in the catalysts after reaction obtained by elemental analysis (see
Table 3
).
3.3. TEM Micrographs and XPS study
The TEM micrographs of the samples registered after reaction are compared, at the same magnification, in
Fig. 2
. The TEM micrograph of the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst clearly shows the typical fibrous particles of the alumina support together with evident metallic particles. In the case of the three Ni-containing catalysts, carbon nanotubes are also very evident, as a typical behavior of Ni catalysts under reforming conditions. The amount of carbon whiskers definitely decreases by increasing the Pt content of Ni-containing catalysts, and possibly also the nature and thickness of their walls seems to be modified. However, Ni metal particles are also evident, in particular for the 4Ni/Al2O3 and the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. In
Table 3

In
Table 4
, the XPS peaks observed for the catalysts discharged under nitrogen (with a minimum contact with air) after reaction are summarized and compared with the data for the fresh catalysts. The data indicate that the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is only partially reduced after reaction, the most abundant species at the surface being Ni aluminate, together with NiO. On the contrary, the monometallic 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is fully reduced, as expected indeed due to its noble metal character. In the case of bimetallic catalysts, the reduction of Ni increases slightly, while Pt is still fully reduced after reaction. It is interesting to remark that, based on XPS data, the composition of the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in terms of metallic elements at the reduced state is out of the stability range of disordered fcc solid solution, entering in the stability range of the ordered Ni3Pt intermetallic compound. In fact, the molar ratio between Ni and Pt metals is, based on these data, a little higher than 3. As said, in our conditions it is certainly difficult to detect superlattice XRD peaks. Actually, a kinetic, rather a thermodynamic, control of the metallic phase crystallization in the preparation and reaction conditions of our catalysts may occur. In any case, the XPS data indicate that all Ni-containing catalysts are only partially reduced even after reaction.

3.4. IR study of CO adsorption over the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst
The characterization after reaction shows that in particular 4Ni/Al2O3 and 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts are partially reduced and covered by carbon nanotubes. To allow IR study, we decided to make this characterization on samples that underwent mild reduction by hydrogen in the IR cell, to avoid formation of carbonaceous materials.
The spectra of CO absorbed over the reduced 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, at low temperature are shown in
Fig. 3
, left. At the highest CO coverage (140 C), a main band is observed at 2069 cm1 with a broad weaker band centered at 1794 cm1. The positions and relative intensities of these bands are typical for CO adsorption on Pt metal particles, where terminal carbonyls (absorbing at 20502100 cm1) usually largely predominate over bridging ones (absorbing at lower frequencies, see Ref.
[35]
and references therein).

Fig. 3. FTIR spectra of absorbed species arising from CO adsorption over the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Left: adsorption at 140 C; (a) before outgassing, (bq) outgassing upon warming (140 C to 20 C). Right: adsorption at room temperature; (a) before outgassing, (b) after outgassing, and (cg) 100500 C.
Two additional sharp weak bands are observed in the presence of the gas, at 2186 and 2161 cm1, but disappear upon outgassing. These bands fall in the typical region of CO stretchings of CO interacting with metal cations
[36]
. The band at 2186 cm1 is assigned to CO σ-bonded to Al3+ ions exposed on the support surface, while the one at 2161 cm1 might be due to species interacting with surface hydroxy groups. However, an assignment of the last species to CO interacting with oxidized Pt centers, likely Pt2+CO species, cannot be completely ruled out.
Outgassing upon warming causes a slight shift of the main maximum from 2069 to 2055 cm1, and also a very slight shift of the band at 1794 cm1 to lower frequencies. However, both bands do not decrease significantly in intensity.
The spectra of surface species arising from CO adsorption over the reduced 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, at room temperature, are presented in
Fig. 3
, right. In contact with the gas, the largely predominant band is centered at 2064 cm1, still in the region of terminal carbonyls, while the band of bridging species is observed at 1815 cm1. The latter disappears faster than the former during outgassing upon heating, in agreement with the lower stability of bridging carbonyls on most Pt single crystal faces (such as Pt{1 1 1} and Pt{1 1 0}), as well as on its steps
[37]
.
Although the assignment of these two adsorptions to terminal and bridging species is straightforward, their position and their shape deserve some discussion. Indeed, the position of the lower frequency band is definitely at lower frequency than for typical bands of bridging carbonyls on Pt crystals, usually in the range 19101840 cm1 on both low-index faces and stepped faces, suggesting a possible assignment to triply bridging species.
On the other hand, also the band of terminal carbonyls is quite broad, clearly showing a sharp component at higher frequencies (2075 cm1) and a broad one at lower frequencies (1970 cm1). After outgassing at room temperature, the maximum slightly shifts to 2058 cm1, the highest frequency component becoming more evident, but the band does not change its relative intensity. After outgassing upon warming (
Fig. 3
, right (cg)), the band of linear carbonyls decreased in intensity and disappeared at 400 C. Additionally, the maximum significantly shifted downwards to 2032 cm1, the two shoulders still appearing more pronounced at the low (1970 cm1) and high (2058 cm1) frequency sides. We can propose that we have again two families of terminal carbonyl species (2058, 2032 cm1) and the anomalous formation of bridging species (1971 cm1) during outgassing upon heating.
This picture shows the presence of different kinds of Pt-adsorbing carbon monoxide.
The adsorption modes of CO on low-index platinum monocrystal surfaces have been reviewed some years ago by Curulla et al.
[35]
. At low coverages, both on Pt{1 1 1} and on Pt{1 1 0} monocrystal faces, only one band is observed by IRAS and/or EELS techniques due to CO adsorbed on atop sites. According to Crossley and King
[38]
, this band shifts from 2063 cm1 at the lowest coverages to 2100 cm1 at saturation on Pt{1 1 1}. Using sum-frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG), this band was found to shift from 2090 to 2105 cm1 when CO pressure increases from 107 to 500 mbar at 300 K on Pt{1 1 1}
[39]
. Klnker et al.
[40]
observed this band shifting from 2065 to 2088 cm1 on Pt{1 1 0}.
These bands have been assigned to isolated CO molecules on reconstructed Pt{1 1 0}-(1 × 2) face and on the 3 × 3-R30 structure on Pt{1 1 1}
[41]
, with only atop sites occupied.
On Pt{1 1 1} at θ > 0.33, a surface phase transition occurs leading to a c(4 × 2) structure where half CO molecules are on-top (2094 cm1) and half bridging (1870 cm1). Also, on Pt{1 1 0} at higher coverages (θ > 0.5), two bands are observed due to on-top and bridging species (1915 cm1)
[42]
.
A similar behavior has also been observed for CO adsorbed on Pt{2 1 1} and on Pt{3 3 5}
[43]
, which are constituted by A-steps (or {1 0 0} steps) separating {1 1 1} terraces of different size. Also, in these cases at low coverage, only step on-top adsorbed CO is observed at 20602070 cm1. At higher coverages, terrace on-top CO is observed (20852100 cm1) together with bridging species. According to Mukerji et al.
[44]
, a step-bridging species first forms on Pt{2 1 1} (18801888 cm1), followed, at saturation coverage, by a bridging species involving one terrace and one step atom (1918 cm1). Xu and Yates
[37]
reported lower frequencies (18451855 cm1) for step-bridging CO on both Pt{2 1 1}and Pt{3 3 5}.
A quite different behavior was observed for CO adsorbed on Pt{1 0 0}. In this case, bridging species appear already at low coverages: IRAS studies on reconstructed Pt{1 0 0}-(1 × 1) show at low coverages bands at 2067 cm1 (atop) and 1870 cm1 (bridging), both shifting to higher frequencies by increasing coverage
[45]
,
[46]
.
Baranova et al.
[47]
investigated by a reflection technique small unsupported Pt particles and observed CO-stretching frequency increasing in the range 20152045 cm1 for Pt particle size increasing from 1 to 6 nm. This shows that the CO stretching of adsorbed CO is sensitive to particle size, the smaller the size the lower the stretching frequency.
An absolute prevalence for terminal species with respect to bridging species is also observed in the IR studies of supported Pt catalysts. According to DeMnorval et al.
[48]
, the frequency of terminal CO on PtAl2O3 catalysts depends on Pt particle size, increasing from 2070 to 2100 cm1 by increasing size from 1 to 10 nm. Rask
[49]
concluded that on alumina, monoatomic zerovalent Pt metal may exist, on which CO adsorbs on-top giving rise to νCO at 2117 cm1. These species can be formed at high CO pressure by reconstruction of Pt particles, when the dominant band due to on-top CO on smooth Pt facets (d  1 nm) is observed at 2078 cm1. At lower CO pressure, bands due to CO adsorbed on edged and kinked Pt atoms of flat Pt particles (2069 and 2041 cm1) are predominant.
Our data appear to be in substantial agreement with those of both DeMnorval et al.

. In fact, the positions of terminal carbonyls with respect to the Pt crystal sizes agree with those reported by DeMnorval et al.
[48]
. We could suppose to have mostly two kinds of particles characterized by a slightly different CO stretching on terminal carbonyls at room temperature, 20752032 cm1 and 20642032 cm1. The latter of these two components, indistinguishable upon low-temperature adsorption, disappears by outgassing at 300 C. It may be assigned to terminal carbonyls on {1 1 1}-like face-exposing particles. The former one, instead, seems to be associated with the band assigned to bridging species, broader, centered near 1940 cm1. These features behave quite in parallel to outgassing at room or slightly higher temperature. They could be assigned to terminal and bridging carbonyls on Pt{1 0 0}-like face-exposing particles. A restructuring phenomenon upon heating may result in the conversion of Pt{1 1 1}-like face-exposing particles into {1 0 0}-like face-exposing particles at 200300 C.
3.5. IR study of CO adsorption over the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst
The spectra of surface species arising from CO adsorption over the reduced 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, at low temperature, are presented in
Fig. 4
, left. In the typical region of carbonyls interacting with metal cations
[36]
, two well-resolved bands were detected at 2184 and 2167 cm1. These bands appear to be more resistant to outgassing and a little stronger than those observed in the same region on 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Interestingly, the lower frequency one resists more than the higher frequency one to outgassing, shifting also upwards to 2173 cm1, which is anomalous for CO interacting with σ-bonds to cationic centers. This suggests that, in the case of the species responsible for the lower frequency band, some additional π-type back-bonding should occur. This allows us to assign with confidence the band at 2184 cm1 to CO adsorbed on Al3+ ions (only σ-bonds) and that at 21672173 cm1 to CO interacting with Ni2+ ions (σ-bonds and π-type back-bonding) like NiO particles or NiAl2O4
[50]
,
[51]
. From this observation, it should be pointed out that, even after reduction, some Ni ions resistant to reduction remain over the catalyst surface.

Several quite sharp bands are observed in the lower frequency region, 21502000 cm1, where CO stretchings of terminal carbonyls on reduced metal centers typically occur. The presence of several sharp bands and the almost total absence of bands in the region typical of bridging and triply bridging species (i.e. <2000 cm1) appear to be more consistent with the formation of polycarbonyl species rather than with CO interacting with metal particles. In fact, CO adsorption on Ni metal particles usually gives rise to low-frequency CO-stretching bands in the region assigned to bridging and triply bridging CO together with and more intense than those due to terminal ones
[52]
. On Ni{1 1 1} at low coverages, a predominant band is observed shifting from 1830 to 1900 cm1 depending on the coverage, traditionally assigned to bridging CO, and a weaker one at 17961825 cm1 usually attributed to hollow adsorbed molecules (triply bridging) together with weak bands due to terminal carbonyls (20302060 cm1 depending on the coverage
[52]
). In fact, more recent structural studies
[53]
,
[54]
show that at increasing coverages, a sequence of different ordered structures, namely p(2 × 2)-(CO), 3 × 3-R30-(CO) and c(2 × 4)-(2CO), all implying only triply bridging species (hcp and fcc positions) occurs. A recent DFT study
[55]
suggested that at half coverage, the two low-frequency bands can be due to in-phase and out-of-phase modes of these structures. Only at higher CO coverage (θ > 0.50), a structure with one on-top and three bridging species forms.
According to Yoshinobu and Kawai
[56]
, on Ni{1 0 0} at 20 K and very low coverage, the bands of terminal and bridging CO are observed at 20192029 cm1 and 18631875 cm1, respectively, the latter split at higher coverages. At room temperatures, these features were found at 2016 cm1 and 1935 cm1
[57]
. A similar situation was found for CO on Ni{3 1 1}
[58]
.
Also, for high loading and highly reduced alumina-supported Ni catalysts, quite broad bands are usually observed upon CO adsorption at 20802020 cm1 and at 19301870 cm1
[59]
,
[60]
,
[61]
, typically assigned to terminal and bridging carbonyls on extended Ni metal particles.
Here, several sharp bands detected above 2000 cm1 suggest the formation of Ni polycarbonyl species. The behavior of these bands upon outgassing under warming suggests the existence of a doublet, at 2090 and 2128 cm1, associated with a more labile species, and a triplet, at 2010, 2038 and 2065 cm1, assigned to a more resistant species. The doublet at 2090 and 2128 cm1 could be associated with the formation of Ni+(CO)2 complexes, which are typically characterized by adsorption bands at 21452130 cm1 and 21002081 cm1
[36]
,
[62]
.
The three weak bands at 2010, 2038 and 2065 cm1, with similar relative intensities, could be due to Ni0 polycarbonyls, like Ni(CO)3, likely frozen precursors of the formation of Ni(CO)4, which is in fact detected in the gas phase after contact of the catalyst surface with CO at room temperature. This may be an indication of the existence of atomically dispersed zerovalent nickel, as already reported for NiYSZ catalysts
[63]
.
Additionally, in the region 19002000 cm1, two really weak shoulders could be distinguished at 1912 and 1947 cm1, which are associated with the presence of small amounts of bridging species, likely on few sufficiently large Ni0 particles. After increasing the temperature, these bands increased in intensity and shifted to 1933 and 1973 cm1, coinciding with the band registered at room temperature.
The spectra of surface species arising from CO adsorption over the reduced 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, at room temperature, shown in
Fig. 4
, right, appear quite different from those observed in the low-temperature adsorption experiment.
In these spectra, in fact, together with several sharp maxima, quite large and strong absorption are observed centered in the regions typical for terminal and bridging carbonyls on extended Ni metal particles
[59]
,
[60]
,
[61]
. After outgassing at 100 C, i.e. at the lowest coverage, these bands are still evident, although weak, at 2017 and 1907 cm1, the latter stronger. The overall spectrum is very similar to the one observed for CO adsorbed at r.t. on Ni{1 0 0}
[57]
. After outgassing at r.t., an additional triplet is observed at 2050, 1976 and 1889 cm1, which could roughly correspond to the spectrum observed for CO adsorbed on Ni{1 1 1}, assigned to terminal and triply bridging species (antisymmetric and symmetric modes)
[52]
,
[53]
,
[54]
,
[55]
. It seems likely that the formation of extended Ni metal particles in this experiment can be due to a restructuring and agglomeration of Ni species favoured by the intermediate formation of gaseous Ni(CO)4, which is in fact detected by IR (strong band at 2057 cm1).
Before outgassing, bands associated with CO interacting with both ionic and metallic isolated Ni species can be identified. Ionic species are identified by bands at 2174 cm1, associated with the presence of Ni2+CO species, and at 2128 cm1, which could be due to the higher frequency component of the doublet assigned to Ni+(CO)2 species, ions, where the associated band located around 2090 cm1 could be masked by the stronger absorption at lower frequency. The sharp features at 2057, 2039 and 2032 cm1 could be due to species like physisorbed Ni(CO)4 and Ni(CO)3, as discussed earlier.
The spectroscopic data here discussed, in agreement with literature findings
[64]
point out the formation of highly isolated and partly ionic Ni centers that tend to aggregate favoured by the evolution of gas-phase Ni(CO)4 already at r.t., producing moderately extended Ni metal particles.
3.6. IR study of CO adsorption over the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst
The spectra of surface species arising from CO adsorption over the reduced 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, at low temperature, are shown in
Fig. 5
, left side. In the region of carbonyls interacting with cation centers, 21502200 cm1, two bands at 2156 and 2184 cm1 were registered. After outgassing, two bands are still evident at 2176 cm1 and 2193 cm1. The lower frequency peak remains in the spectrum even after extensive outgassing of the sample. As discussed earlier, the band shifting from 2184 cm1 toward higher frequencies is confidently assigned to Al3+CO carbonyls, while that at ca. 2176 cm1 is assigned to Ni2+CO. The very labile component at ca. 2156 cm1 can be due to CO interacting with surface hydroxyl groups, and/or to Pt2+CO species. This shows again the presence of unreduced Ni after our reduction treatment.

Right: adsorption at room temperature; (a) before outgassing, (b) after outgassing, and (cf) 100400 C.
In the lower frequency region, we can distinguish two bands of species that resist outgassing, although shifted significantly to lower frequencies. The bands at 20892060 cm1 and 19381925 cm1 seem to resemble more to CO adsorbed on Pt{1 0 0}-like face (as discussed earlier for the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst spectra), than to CO on Ni metal particles. On the other hand, the three bands at 2067, 2037 and 2012 cm1, which behave quite in parallel and correspond to a more labile species, are closely similar to those previously assigned to Ni0 polycarbonyls, like Ni(CO)3.
In
Fig. 5
, right, the spectra of absorbed species arising from CO adsorption at room temperature over the reduced 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst are presented. These features are again quite different with respect to those observed in the low-temperature experiment spectra. At high frequency, two weak bands at 2176 and 2127 cm1, corresponding to very labile species, are assigned again to Ni2+CO and Ni+(CO)2 species (higher frequency component).
In the lower frequency region, bands typical of terminal and bridging CO over metal crystals, resisting outgassing, can be seen again. This time, however, the maximum of νCO of terminal carbonyls is observed quite split, with one component shifting from ca. 2055 to 2019 cm1, and another component evident as a shoulder in the 20702050 cm1 range. While the former is typical for terminal CO on Ni crystal faces, the latter is more typical of CO on Pt monocrystal faces. This suggests that two kinds of metal particles exist, one of which is Ni rich, the other Pt rich. At lower frequency, a band assigned to bridging species is found also split, with a component near 1930 cm1, the other near 1889 cm1, also behaving in a different way. Only at high loadings, a further band at 1977 cm1 can be found. These data suggest that we can find three different kinds of metal surfaces, i.e. a Pt{1 0 0}-like face (20702050 cm1 and 1930 cm1), a Ni{1 0 0}-like face (2019 and ca. 1900 cm1) and a Ni{1 1 1}-like face (ca. 2050, 1977 and 1889 cm1). As a comparison, we can cite here that CO adsorption on a Pt25Ni75 {1 1 1} monocrystal face has been studied by HREELS
[65]
, showing a main band assigned to terminal surface carbonyls at 2065 cm1 and, depending on pre-treatment, a weaker band assigned to triply bridging CO on Ni atoms at 1839 cm1.
The formation of Ni metal particles at room temperature can be again attributed to the role of volatile Ni(CO)4, which allows the agglomeration of Ni atoms.
Also in this experiment, we find at high coverages weak and sharp features at 2058, 2039 and 2015 cm1, assigned to Ni0 polycarbonyls, like Ni(CO)3, likely frozen precursors of the formation of Ni(CO)4, which is in fact detected in the gas phase.
3.7. IR study of CO adsorption over the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst
In
Fig. 6
, left, the spectra of surface species arising from CO adsorption over the reduced 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, at low temperature, are presented. The spectra are clearly dominated by a main band shifting from 2079 to 2064 cm1 by increasing temperature upon outgassing, which is definitely similar to that of terminal carbonyls on Pt crystal faces. However, the position of this band is clearly shifted up with respect to that observed on the 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (20692054 cm1). This is certainly an effect of the presence of Ni species. Additionally, a broader band due to a less stable bridging species is found at 1930 cm1, which can be assigned to bridging CO on Pt{1 0 0}-like particles.

Right: adsorption at room temperature; (a) before outgassing, (b) after outgassing, and (c and g) 100500 C.
The spectra recorded at room temperature (
Fig. 6
, right) confirm the existence of terminal carbonyls over a Pt{1 0 0}-like surface, whose νCO is shifting from 2071 down to 2025 cm1, and weak and labile bridging species whose νCO is centered at 1920 cm1.
At low temperature (
Fig. 6
, left) besides these species, other more labile ones can be found, in particular at 2185, 2166, 2037 and 2010 cm1. The assignment of the band at 2185 cm1 to Al3+CO carbonyls, and of the bands at 2037 and 2010 cm1 to Ni0 polycarbonyls, like Ni(CO)3 species, seems straightforward, in agreement to the earlier discussion. The higher frequency component of the triplet is superimposed to the main band. Based on its frequency, the assignment of the band at 2166 cm1, to either H-bonded CO species or to Pt2+CO species is likely.
Interestingly, we do not find here the features associated with carbonyl species on unreduced Ni, like Ni2+CO and Ni+(CO)2, found in the case of 4Ni/Al2O3 and 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. This suggests that, in this case, due to the relevant amount of Pt present, nickel is more easily reduced. We can remind that XPS data point out that after reaction conditions all Ni-containing catalysts retain Ni largely oxidized. This may be due to the redox character of the dry-reforming reaction, where CO2 acts as an oxidant and may participate in keeping high the oxidation state of nickel.
4. Discussion
The catalytic data reported here show that the monometallic 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is slightly more active than the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the dry reforming of methane, in spite of the smaller metal content, in agreement with the intrinsically higher activity of platinum with respect to nickel in the reaction. However, an improvement in the catalyst activity can be obtained not only by introducing a small amount of Pt on the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst) but also adding a significant amount of Ni to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst). It is evident that some kind of synergy occurs between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, improving DRM activity, in terms of conversion. Thus, these elements have a mutual role of activators for each other. However, the most relevant effect that can also have practical application is that the addition of small amounts of Pt significantly decreases the deactivation rate of the catalyst (as discussed in detail elsewhere
[28]
) by reducing the formation of carbon nanotubes. Thus, small amounts of Pt can be useful to increase catalyst life, thus acting as stabilizer for Ni/Al2O3 catalysts.
The data summarized earlier show that the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is largely oxidized not only after mild reduction treatment in the IR cell but also after dry reforming of methane catalytic runs. XPS data show Ni aluminate, whose formation implies a slow reaction at high temperature with the support, as the predominant Ni species. This is typical for a non-noble metal-like nickel. However, these data, which may confirm previous ones reported for Ni-based ethanol steam-reforming catalysts
[16]
,
[63]
, suggest that dry-reforming and steam-reforming processes, where actually redox reactions are performed, may involve redox cycles of catalysts, thus involving not only Ni metal but also oxidized Ni centers. In practice, it seems clear that the oxidation state of nickel is flexible in reforming conditions and that nickel may be oxidized at the surface by water and by CO2, also with the help of the dispersing ability for Ni ions of ionic supports like alumina. As discussed previously
[61]
, this point of view partly contradicts all-metal catalysis, mostly supposed to occur for both reforming and methanation on Ni catalysts, although it is not excluded that two mechanisms can act simultaneously (all metallic and redox).
The difference between room-temperature and low-temperature CO adsorption experiments provide evidence of the formation at r.t. of Ni(CO)4 and of a likely role of this volatile compound of allowing restructuring and coalescence of Ni metal particles at room temperature. This is a case where the use of CO as a probe must be taken with care, because it may have a role in surface modification. The formation of gas-phase Ni(CO)4 has been put in relation to the formation of a sharp and weak triplet during CO adsorption, at ca. 2065, 2038 and 2010 cm1, with similar relative intensities, assigned to Ni0 polycarbonyls, like Ni(CO)3, likely frozen precursors of the formation of Ni(CO)4.
As expected, our Pt/Al2O3 catalyst appears to be fully reduced both after reaction and after hydrogen treatment in the cell, producing small but well-characterized nanocrystals whose surface appears to be formed by both Pt{1 0 0}-like and Pt{1 1 1}-like faces. A restructuring phenomenon upon heating may result in the conversion of Pt{1 1 1}-like face-exposing particles into {1 0 0}-like face-exposing particles at 200300 C.
As for the bimetallic catalysts, it is evident that at least for the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 sample, a fcc solid solution certainly forms, as previously found for silica-supported PtNi catalysts
[31]
,
[32]
,
[33]
,
[34]
. The application of the Vegards rule to the data arising from XRD for spent catalyst suggest that the real composition of the solid solution (in terms of Ni to Pt ratio) is similar to that of the virtual composition of the catalyst. However, XPS data suggest that only a small part of nickel is reduced after reaction, thus the metallic Ni to metallic Pt ratio is much lower. IR spectra of adsorbed CO confirm that a solid solution occurs, indicating that the surface appears to be dominated by Pt centers whose electron-withdrawing character is increased by nickel. In fact, the CO-stretching frequency on the alloy is 10 cm1 higher than on pure Pt. On the other hand, the data suggest that the alloy is enriched at the surface by Pt but has also a definitely smaller crystal size than the metal particles on pure Pt and Ni catalyst, and this may be the main reason of higher νCO for terminal carbonyls.
Previous studies reported face-dependent surface enrichment on PtNi alloys: according to these studies, {1 1 1} and {1 0 0} surfaces tend to be Pt-enriched, while {1 1 0} tends to be Ni-enriched
[65]
,
[66]
. In agreement with this, our data suggest that on the bimetallic catalyst a Pt{1 0 0}-like surface is mostly exposed.
In agreement with very recent results reported by Mukainakano et al.
[67]
, in spite of the larger concentration on nickel, the surface of bimetallic NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts seems to be due to Pt-rich metal surfaces together with mostly dispersed and easily oxidized Ni centers. The addition of platinum, however, favors the formation of even smaller metal particles with respect to pure nickel, thus increasing significantly the electron-withdrawing ability of Pt centers.
The presence of such particles modifies the chemical behavior of Ni, increasing its reducibility as shown by XPS data as well as by Temperature-Programmed Reduction results
[68]
. The surface enrichment by platinum is at the origin of the lower tendency to form carbonaceous materials, with the result of increasing stability of the catalyst
[28]
and enhancing slightly the catalytic activity of Ni/Al2O3.
