[1] "The catalytic data reported here show that the monometallic 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is slightly more active than the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the dry reforming of methane, in spite of the smaller metal content, in agreement with the intrinsically higher activity of platinum with respect to nickel in the reaction."

[2] "However, an improvement in the catalyst activity can be obtained not only by introducing a small amount of Pt on the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst) but also adding a significant amount of Ni to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst)."

[3] "It is evident that some kind of synergy occurs between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, improving DRM activity, in terms of conversion. Thus, these elements have a mutual role of activators for each other."

[4] "However, the most relevant effect that can also have practical application is that the addition of small amounts of Pt significantly decreases the deactivation rate of the catalyst (as discussed in detail elsewhere [28]) by reducing the formation of carbon nanotubes."

[5] "IR spectra of adsorbed CO confirm that a solid solution occurs, indicating that the surface appears to be dominated by Pt centers whose electron-withdrawing character is increased by nickel."

Based on the provided literature, bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of methane dry reforming in several ways:

1. They exhibit synergistic effects, improving catalytic activity compared to monometallic Ni or Pt catalysts. The bimetallic catalysts show higher conversion rates in dry reforming of methane.

2. The addition of small amounts of Pt to Ni/Al2O3 catalysts significantly decreases the deactivation rate by reducing the formation of carbon nanotubes. This enhances catalyst stability and lifetime.

3. The bimetallic catalysts form a solid solution, with the surface dominated by Pt centers. The presence of Ni increases the electron-withdrawing character of these Pt centers, which likely affects their catalytic properties.

4. The formation of smaller metal particles in bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic ones increases the electron-withdrawing ability of Pt centers, potentially enhancing their catalytic activity.

While the literature does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reaction, it suggests that similar synergistic effects might be observed in these reactions as well.

Future UHV studies could provide insights into:

1. The surface composition and structure of Pt-Ni alloys under reaction conditions.
2. The electronic properties of Pt centers in the presence of Ni and how they correlate with catalytic activity.
3. The mechanism of carbon nanotube formation inhibition by Pt in bimetallic catalysts.
4. The role of particle size in determining catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces.

These UHV studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the structure-activity relationships in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.

根据提供的文献，Pt-Ni双金属催化剂以几种方式影响甲烷干重整的机理和效率：

1. 它们表现出协同效应，与单金属Ni或Pt催化剂相比，提高了催化活性。双金属催化剂在甲烷干重整中显示出更高的转化率。

2. 向Ni/Al2O3催化剂中添加少量Pt可显著降低失活率，减少碳纳米管的形成。这提高了催化剂的稳定性和使用寿命。

3. 双金属催化剂形成固溶体，表面以Pt中心为主。Ni的存在增加了这些Pt中心的吸电子性，这可能影响其催化性能。

4. 与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂形成的金属颗粒更小，增加了Pt中心的吸电子能力，可能增强其催化活性。

虽然文献没有直接涉及CO氧化或水煤气变换反应，但它暗示这些反应中可能也会观察到类似的协同效应。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可以提供以下见解：

1. 反应条件下Pt-Ni合金的表面组成和结构。
2. Ni存在下Pt中心的电子性质，以及它们与催化活性的相关性。
3. Pt在双金属催化剂中抑制碳纳米管形成的机理。
4. 粒子尺寸在决定双金属表面催化性能中的作用。

这些UHV研究可以帮助弥合模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距，为Pt基双金属催化剂的结构-活性关系提供更全面的理解。

[1] "Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are also quite largely used as dehydrogenation catalysts such as in the Oleflex light paraffin dehydrogenation technology and in the Pacol long linear paraffin dehydrogenation technology, both from UOP"

[2] "The activity of the 0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst does not present significant modifications with respect to the monometallic Ni catalyst. The conversion of both methane and CO2 is maximum for the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst."

[3] "It is evident that some kind of synergy occurs between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, improving DRM activity, in terms of conversion. Thus, these elements have a mutual role of activators for each other."

The bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts show synergistic effects that improve dry reforming of methane (DRM) activity compared to monometallic catalysts. Specifically:

1. The 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst showed maximum conversion of both methane and CO2, indicating improved efficiency for DRM. 

2. Adding small amounts of Pt to Ni catalysts significantly decreased catalyst deactivation by reducing carbon nanotube formation. This improves catalyst stability and lifetime.

3. Pt and Ni appear to mutually activate each other when combined on an alumina support, enhancing overall catalytic performance.

4. The synergy likely stems from changes in metal particle size, reducibility, and surface composition in the bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic versions.

While this study focused on DRM, the synergistic effects could potentially extend to other reactions like CO oxidation and water-gas shift. Future UHV studies on model Pt-Ni surfaces could help elucidate the atomic-scale origins of these synergistic effects by allowing detailed characterization of surface structure, composition, and adsorption properties. This could provide insights to correlate with the reactor studies on supported catalysts. However, preparing and studying well-defined bimetallic surfaces in UHV remains challenging.

双金属Pt-Ni催化剂显示出协同效应,可提高甲烷干重整(DRM)活性,相比单金属催化剂表现更佳。具体来说:

1. 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3催化剂显示出最高的甲烷和CO2转化率,表明其在DRM反应中的效率得到了提高。

2. 向Ni催化剂中添加少量Pt可显著降低催化剂失活率,减少碳纳米管的形成。这提高了催化剂的稳定性和使用寿命。

3. 当Pt和Ni结合在氧化铝载体上时,似乎可以相互激活,从而提高整体催化性能。

4. 这种协同效应可能源于双金属催化剂中金属粒子尺寸、可还原性和表面组成的变化,与单金属版本相比有所不同。

虽然这项研究集中在DRM反应上,但这种协同效应可能也适用于其他反应,如CO氧化和水煤气变换反应。未来在模型Pt-Ni表面上进行的超高真空(UHV)研究可以帮助阐明这些协同效应的原子尺度起源,通过允许对表面结构、组成和吸附性质进行详细表征。这可以为支撑催化剂的反应器研究提供相关性见解。然而,在UHV条件下制备和研究明确定义的双金属表面仍然具有挑战性。

The bimetallic PtNi catalysts show synergistic effects that improve dry reforming of methane (DRM) activity compared to monometallic Pt or Ni catalysts. Adding small amounts of Pt to Ni/Al2O3 catalysts or Ni to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts enhances catalytic activity. The most significant effect is that adding small amounts of Pt to Ni catalysts decreases deactivation by reducing carbon nanotube formation.

The PtNi alloy formation results in Pt-dominated surfaces with increased electron-withdrawing character of Pt centers due to Ni. This modification of the electronic properties likely contributes to the improved catalytic performance.

The document does not provide specific information on CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions for these catalysts. It also does not discuss potential insights from UHV studies. To fully address the question, additional studies comparing reactor and UHV results for these reactions on PtNi bimetallic surfaces would be needed.

The literature provides insights into how bimetallic PtNi catalysts influence methane conversion mechanisms and efficiencies in reactor studies, particularly for dry reforming of methane (DRM). 

PtNi alloy formation results in higher catalytic activity and lower carbon deposition compared to monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts. This is attributed to several factors:

1. Surface enrichment with Pt: The PtNi alloy surface is dominated by Pt centers, which likely contributes to improved catalytic performance.

2. Smaller metal crystal size: The PtNi alloy particles are smaller than those in monometallic catalysts, potentially increasing the number of active sites.

3. Enhanced electron-withdrawing ability: Ni increases the electron-withdrawing character of Pt centers in the alloy, which may modify reactivity.

4. Improved Ni reducibility: The presence of Pt modifies Ni's chemical behavior, increasing its reducibility.

These findings suggest synergistic effects between Pt and Ni that enhance catalytic performance for methane conversion. However, the literature does not directly address CO oxidation or water gas shift reactions.

Future UHV studies could provide valuable insights by:

1. Investigating surface composition and structure of model PtNi alloy surfaces.
2. Examining adsorption and reaction mechanisms of relevant species (CH4, CO2, H2O, CO) on these surfaces.
3. Correlating UHV results with reactor studies to bridge the pressure and materials gaps.
4. Exploring how particle size and composition affect catalytic properties in more controlled environments.

Such studies could help elucidate the fundamental reasons for the improved performance of PtNi bimetallic catalysts and guide the design of more efficient catalysts for various reactions.

文献为我们提供了关于双金属PtNi催化剂如何影响反应器研究中甲烷转化机理和效率的见解，特别是对于甲烷干重整（DRM）反应。

PtNi合金的形成导致了比单金属Pt和Ni催化剂更高的催化活性和更低的碳沉积。这可归因于几个因素：

1. 表面富Pt：PtNi合金表面以Pt中心为主，这可能有助于提高催化性能。

2. 更小的金属晶体尺寸：PtNi合金颗粒比单金属催化剂中的颗粒更小，可能增加了活性位点的数量。

3. 增强的电子吸引能力：在合金中，Ni增加了Pt中心的电子吸引特性，这可能会改变反应活性。

4. 提高Ni的可还原性：Pt的存在改变了Ni的化学行为，增加了其可还原性。

这些发现表明Pt和Ni之间存在协同效应，可以提高甲烷转化的催化性能。然而，文献并未直接讨论CO氧化或水煤气变换反应。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可以通过以下方式提供有价值的见解：

1. 研究模型PtNi合金表面的成分和结构。
2. 检查相关物种（CH4、CO2、H2O、CO）在这些表面上的吸附和反应机理。
3. 将UHV结果与反应器研究相关联，以弥合压力和材料差距。
4. 在更受控的环境中探索粒子尺寸和成分如何影响催化性能。

这些研究可以帮助阐明PtNi双金属催化剂性能提高的根本原因，并指导设计更高效的催化剂用于各种反应。
