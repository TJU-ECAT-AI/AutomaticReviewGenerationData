          [1] "The catalytic data reported here show that the monometallic 0.4Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is slightly more active than the 4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the dry reforming of methane, in spite of the smaller metal content, in agreement with the intrinsically higher activity of platinum with respect to nickel in the reaction."

[2] "However, an improvement in the catalyst activity can be obtained not only by introducing a small amount of Pt on the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (0.04Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst) but also adding a significant amount of Ni to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 catalyst)."

[3] "It is evident that some kind of synergy occurs between Ni and Pt on the alumina carrier, improving DRM activity, in terms of conversion. Thus, these elements have a mutual role of activators for each other."

[4] "However, the most relevant effect that can also have practical application is that the addition of small amounts of Pt significantly decreases the deactivation rate of the catalyst (as discussed in detail elsewhere [28]) by reducing the formation of carbon nanotubes."

[5] "IR spectra of adsorbed CO confirm that a solid solution occurs, indicating that the surface appears to be dominated by Pt centers whose electron-withdrawing character is increased by nickel."

[6] "The formation of PtNi alloy, which is enriched at the surface by Pt and has smaller metal crystal size than metal particles in monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts. The alloy formation is associated with higher activity and lower production of carbonaceous materials upon dry reforming of methane."

[7] "The addition of platinum, however, favors the formation of even smaller metal particles with respect to pure nickel, thus increasing significantly the electron-withdrawing ability of Pt centers."

[8] "The presence of such particles modifies the chemical behavior of Ni, increasing its reducibility as shown by XPS data as well as by Temperature-Programmed Reduction results"

          Based on the provided literature, bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of methane dry reforming (DRM) in several ways:

1. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic PtNi catalysts show improved catalytic activity compared to monometallic Ni or Pt catalysts. The combination of Pt and Ni results in higher conversion rates in DRM.

2. Enhanced stability: The addition of small amounts of Pt to Ni/Al2O3 catalysts significantly decreases the deactivation rate by reducing the formation of carbon nanotubes. This improves catalyst stability and lifetime.

3. Surface composition: The bimetallic catalysts form a solid solution, with the surface dominated by Pt centers. The presence of Ni increases the electron-withdrawing character of these Pt centers, likely affecting their catalytic properties.

4. Particle size effects: The formation of smaller metal particles in bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic ones increases the electron-withdrawing ability of Pt centers, potentially enhancing their catalytic activity.

5. Improved Ni reducibility: The presence of Pt modifies the chemical behavior of Ni, increasing its reducibility.

6. Lower carbon formation: PtNi alloy formation is associated with lower production of carbonaceous materials during DRM.

While the literature focuses on DRM, it suggests that similar synergistic effects might be observed in other reactions like CO oxidation or water gas shift reaction.

Future UHV studies could provide insights into:

1. The surface composition and structure of Pt-Ni alloys under reaction conditions.
2. The electronic properties of Pt centers in the presence of Ni and how they correlate with catalytic activity.
3. The mechanism of carbon nanotube formation inhibition by Pt in bimetallic catalysts.
4. The role of particle size in determining catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces.
5. Adsorption and reaction mechanisms of relevant species (CH4, CO2, H2O, CO) on model PtNi surfaces.

These UHV studies could help bridge the gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the structure-activity relationships in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. However, preparing and studying well-defined bimetallic surfaces in UHV remains challenging.

          根据所提供的文献，Pt-Ni双金属催化剂通过以下几种方式影响甲烷干重整（DRM）的机理和效率：

1. 协同效应：与单金属Ni或Pt催化剂相比，双金属PtNi催化剂表现出更高的催化活性。Pt和Ni的组合导致DRM反应中更高的转化率。

2. 提高稳定性：向Ni/Al2O3催化剂中添加少量Pt可显著降低失活率，减少碳纳米管的形成。这提高了催化剂的稳定性和使用寿命。

3. 表面组成：双金属催化剂形成固溶体，表面以Pt中心为主。Ni的存在增加了这些Pt中心的吸电子性，这可能影响其催化性能。

4. 粒子尺寸效应：与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂形成的金属颗粒更小，增加了Pt中心的吸电子能力，可能增强其催化活性。

5. 提高Ni的可还原性：Pt的存在改变了Ni的化学行为，增加了其可还原性。

6. 降低碳形成：PtNi合金的形成与DRM过程中较低的碳质材料产生相关。

虽然文献主要集中在DRM反应上，但它暗示在其他反应（如CO氧化或水煤气变换反应）中可能也会观察到类似的协同效应。

未来的超高真空（UHV）研究可以提供以下见解：

1. 反应条件下Pt-Ni合金的表面组成和结构。
2. Ni存在下Pt中心的电子性质，以及它们与催化活性的相关性。
3. Pt在双金属催化剂中抑制碳纳米管形成的机理。
4. 粒子尺寸在决定双金属表面催化性能中的作用。
5. 相关物种（CH4、CO2、H2O、CO）在模型PtNi表面上的吸附和反应机理。

这些UHV研究可以帮助弥合模型表面和负载催化剂之间的差距，为Pt基双金属催化剂的结构-活性关系提供更全面的理解。然而，在UHV条件下制备和研究明确定义的双金属表面仍然具有挑战性。
