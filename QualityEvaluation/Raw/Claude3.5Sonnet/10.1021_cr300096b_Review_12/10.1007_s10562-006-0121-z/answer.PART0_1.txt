[1] "The co-impregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 was superior to Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/Pt/γ-Al2O3 prepared by a sequential impregnation of each component on alumina support."

[2] "As the reduction temperature increased above 423 K, the CO2 selectivity decreased and the atomic percent of Ni in the bimetallic phase of PtNi increased."

[3] "This catalyst exhibited the high CO conversion even in the presence of 2% H2O and 20% CO2 over a wide reaction temperature."

[4] "The bimetallic phase of PtNi seems to give rise to high catalytic activity for the PROX in H2-rich stream."

The study focuses on PtNi bimetallic catalysts for preferential CO oxidation (PROX) in hydrogen-rich streams. The co-impregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst showed superior performance compared to sequentially impregnated catalysts. The bimetallic PtNi phase was found to be crucial for high catalytic activity in PROX reactions.

The reduction temperature affected the catalyst's performance. Higher reduction temperatures above 423 K led to decreased CO2 selectivity but increased the atomic percentage of Ni in the bimetallic PtNi phase. The catalyst maintained high CO conversion even in the presence of water and CO2 over a wide temperature range.

While this study provides valuable insights into bimetallic PtNi catalysts for CO oxidation, it does not directly address water gas shift reactions or methane conversions. The research is based on reactor studies rather than UHV experiments, so it doesn't provide information on correlations with model surfaces or supported catalysts in UHV conditions.

Future UHV studies could potentially bridge the gap between reactor studies and model surfaces by investigating the surface structure and composition of PtNi bimetallic catalysts under controlled conditions. This could provide insights into the role of the bimetallic phase in enhancing catalytic activity and how it relates to the performance observed in reactor studies. Additionally, UHV studies could help elucidate the specific mechanisms of CO adsorption and oxidation on PtNi surfaces, which could inform the design of more efficient catalysts for PROX and related reactions.

这项研究主要关注PtNi双金属催化剂在富氢流中的优先CO氧化（PROX）反应。共浸渍制备的PtNi/γ-Al2O3催化剂显示出比顺序浸渍制备的催化剂更优越的性能。研究发现，双金属PtNi相对PROX反应的高催化活性至关重要。

还原温度影响了催化剂的性能。当还原温度高于423 K时，CO2选择性降低，但双金属PtNi相中Ni的原子百分比增加。该催化剂在存在水和CO2的条件下，在较宽的温度范围内仍保持高CO转化率。

虽然这项研究为CO氧化反应的双金属PtNi催化剂提供了宝贵的见解，但并未直接涉及水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化。该研究基于反应器研究而非超高真空（UHV）实验，因此未能提供与模型表面或UHV条件下负载催化剂的相关信息。

未来的UHV研究可能会通过在受控条件下研究PtNi双金属催化剂的表面结构和组成，来弥合反应器研究与模型表面之间的差距。这可能会提供关于双金属相在增强催化活性中的作用以及它如何与反应器研究中观察到的性能相关的见解。此外，UHV研究可能有助于阐明CO在PtNi表面上吸附和氧化的具体机制，这可能为设计更高效的PROX和相关反应催化剂提供指导。
