[1] "The co-impregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 was superior to Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/Pt/γ-Al2O3 prepared by a sequential impregnation of each component on alumina support."

[2] "As the reduction temperature increased above 423 K, the CO2 selectivity decreased and the atomic percent of Ni in the bimetallic phase of PtNi increased."

The literature provides some insights into how bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts influence CO oxidation, but does not directly address water gas shift reaction or methane conversions. The study shows that co-impregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts perform better than sequentially impregnated versions for preferential CO oxidation (PROX) in hydrogen-rich streams. The bimetallic PtNi phase appears to be responsible for high catalytic activity in PROX reactions.

The reduction temperature affects the catalyst's performance, with higher temperatures above 423 K leading to decreased CO2 selectivity but increased Ni content in the bimetallic PtNi phase. This suggests that the composition and structure of the bimetallic phase play a crucial role in determining catalytic activity and selectivity.

The document does not provide information on UHV studies or their potential insights. However, future UHV studies could potentially help elucidate the surface structure and composition of these bimetallic catalysts, which could be correlated with their performance in reactor studies. Such studies might provide atomic-level understanding of how the Pt-Ni interaction influences adsorption and reaction mechanisms, which could explain the observed superior performance of the bimetallic catalyst.

It's important to note that the current study focuses on supported catalysts under realistic reaction conditions, while UHV studies typically deal with model surfaces. Bridging this gap could provide valuable insights into the structure-function relationships of these catalysts, although the document does not address the current limitations of UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

该文献为双金属Pt-Ni催化剂如何影响CO氧化提供了一些见解，但没有直接涉及水气变换反应或甲烷转化。研究表明，共浸渍的PtNi/γ-Al2O3催化剂在富氢流中的优先CO氧化（PROX）反应中表现优于顺序浸渍的版本。双金属PtNi相似乎是PROX反应中高催化活性的原因。

还原温度会影响催化剂的性能，当温度高于423 K时，CO2选择性降低，但双金属PtNi相中Ni的含量增加。这表明双金属相的组成和结构在决定催化活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。

文献没有提供关于超高真空（UHV）研究或其潜在见解的信息。然而，未来的UHV研究可能有助于阐明这些双金属催化剂的表面结构和组成，这可以与它们在反应器研究中的性能相关联。这类研究可能提供Pt-Ni相互作用如何影响吸附和反应机理的原子级理解，从而解释观察到的双金属催化剂的优异性能。

需要注意的是，当前研究集中在实际反应条件下的负载型催化剂，而UHV研究通常涉及模型表面。弥合这一差距可能为这些催化剂的结构-功能关系提供宝贵的见解，尽管文献并未涉及UHV研究在Pt基双金属表面上的当前局限性。
