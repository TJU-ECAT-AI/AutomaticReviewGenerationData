[1] "The co-impregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 was superior to Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/Pt/γ-Al2O3 prepared by a sequential impregnation of each component on alumina support."

[2] "As the reduction temperature increased above 423 K, the CO2 selectivity decreased and the atomic percent of Ni in the bimetallic phase of PtNi increased."

[3] "The bimetallic phase of PtNi seems to give rise to high catalytic activity for the PROX in H2-rich stream."

The literature provides limited information on the specific mechanisms of bimetallic catalysts for CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions. However, it does offer some insights into the influence of Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts on CO oxidation efficiency.

The study shows that co-impregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts performed better than sequentially impregnated Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/Pt/γ-Al2O3 for preferential CO oxidation (PROX) in hydrogen-rich streams. The bimetallic phase of PtNi was found to contribute to high catalytic activity for PROX.

The reduction temperature affected the catalyst's performance. Higher reduction temperatures above 423 K led to decreased CO2 selectivity but increased the atomic percent of Ni in the PtNi bimetallic phase.

The literature does not provide information on water gas shift reaction or methane conversions, nor does it discuss potential insights from future UHV studies or correlations with model surfaces and supported catalysts. The limitations of UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are also not addressed in this text.

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of these topics, further research and literature review would be necessary, particularly focusing on UHV studies of Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and their correlations with reactor studies.

该文献对双金属催化剂在CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化方面的具体机理提供的信息有限。然而，它确实提供了一些关于Pt-Ni双金属催化剂对CO氧化效率影响的见解。

研究表明，共浸渍的PtNi/γ-Al2O3催化剂在富氢流中的优先CO氧化（PROX）反应中表现优于序贯浸渍的Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3和Ni/Pt/γ-Al2O3。PtNi的双金属相被发现有助于PROX反应的高催化活性。

还原温度影响催化剂的性能。高于423 K的还原温度导致CO2选择性降低，但PtNi双金属相中Ni的原子百分比增加。

该文献没有提供关于水煤气变换反应或甲烷转化的信息，也没有讨论未来UHV研究可能提供的见解或与模型表面和负载催化剂的相关性。文中也未提及UHV研究Pt基双金属表面的局限性。

要全面理解这些主题，需要进行进一步的研究和文献综述，特别是关注Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究及其与反应器研究的相关性。
