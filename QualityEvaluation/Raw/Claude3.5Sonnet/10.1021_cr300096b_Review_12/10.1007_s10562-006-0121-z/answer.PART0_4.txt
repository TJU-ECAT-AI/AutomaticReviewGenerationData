[1] "The co-impregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 was superior to Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/Pt/γ-Al2O3 prepared by a sequential impregnation of each component on alumina support."

[2] "As the reduction temperature increased above 423 K, the CO2 selectivity decreased and the atomic percent of Ni in the bimetallic phase of PtNi increased."

[3] "The bimetallic phase of PtNi seems to give rise to high catalytic activity for the PROX in H2-rich stream."

The literature provides limited information to fully answer the question, but it does offer some insights into Pt-based bimetallic catalysts for CO oxidation. The study focuses on PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for preferential CO oxidation (PROX) in hydrogen-rich streams.

The bimetallic PtNi catalyst prepared by co-impregnation showed superior performance compared to sequentially impregnated catalysts. This suggests that the preparation method influences the catalyst's efficiency for CO oxidation. The formation of a bimetallic PtNi phase was found to be crucial for high catalytic activity in PROX reactions.

The reduction temperature affected the catalyst's performance. Higher reduction temperatures above 423 K led to decreased CO2 selectivity but increased the atomic percent of Ni in the bimetallic PtNi phase. This indicates that the composition and structure of the bimetallic phase play a significant role in determining the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity.

While the study doesn't directly address water gas shift reactions or methane conversions, it does mention that the PtNi catalyst exhibited high CO conversion even in the presence of 2% H2O and 20% CO2 over a wide reaction temperature range. This suggests that the bimetallic catalyst may have potential applications in other related reactions.

The literature does not provide information on UHV studies or model surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially help elucidate the surface structure and composition of these bimetallic catalysts, providing insights into the atomic-level mechanisms of CO adsorption and oxidation. Such studies could also help correlate the performance of supported catalysts with model surfaces, leading to a better understanding of the active sites and reaction pathways involved in these catalytic processes.

文献提供的信息有限，无法全面回答问题，但确实为基于Pt的双金属催化剂在CO氧化方面提供了一些见解。该研究主要关注PtNi/γ-Al2O3催化剂在富氢气流中的优先CO氧化（PROX）反应。

通过共浸渍法制备的双金属PtNi催化剂表现出优于顺序浸渍法制备的催化剂的性能。这表明制备方法影响催化剂在CO氧化反应中的效率。研究发现，形成双金属PtNi相对于PROX反应的高催化活性至关重要。

还原温度影响催化剂的性能。高于423 K的还原温度导致CO2选择性降低，但双金属PtNi相中Ni的原子百分比增加。这表明双金属相的组成和结构在决定催化剂的效率和选择性方面起着重要作用。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及水气变换反应或甲烷转化，但确实提到PtNi催化剂在存在2%H2O和20%CO2的情况下，在较宽的反应温度范围内仍表现出高CO转化率。这表明双金属催化剂可能在其他相关反应中具有潜在应用。

文献没有提供关于超高真空（UHV）研究或模型表面的信息。未来的UHV研究可能有助于阐明这些双金属催化剂的表面结构和组成，为CO吸附和氧化的原子级机制提供见解。这些研究还可以帮助将负载型催化剂的性能与模型表面相关联，从而更好地理解这些催化过程中涉及的活性位点和反应途径。
