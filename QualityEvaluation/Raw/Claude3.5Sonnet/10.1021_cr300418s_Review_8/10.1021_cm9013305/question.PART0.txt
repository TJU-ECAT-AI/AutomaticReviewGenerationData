Abstract
Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 was synthesized by hydrothermal method using diethylenetriamine as complexing agent (Chem.Mater.2008, 20, 7268). Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 being the only compound likes UO2+δ to have excess oxygen, it releases a large proportion of its lattice oxygen (0.167 M [O]/mole of compound) at relatively low temperature (465 C) directly and it has been utilized for generation of H2 by thermo-splitting of water. An almost stoichiometric amount of H2 (0.152 M/Mole of compound) is generated at much lower temperature (65 C). There is an almost comparable amount of oxygen release and hydrogen generation over this material at very low temperature compared to other CeO2MOx (Mn, Fe, Cu, and Ni) mixed-oxide solid solutions (O2 evolution 1300 C and H2 generation at 1000 C). The reversible nature of oxygen release and intake of this material is attributed to its fluorite structure and coupling between the Ce4+/Ce3+ and Cr4+/6+/Cr3+ redox couples. Compound shows reversible oxygen release and intake by H2O absorption and subsequent hydrogen release to gain parent structure and hence this material can be utilized for generation of H2 at very low temperature by thermo-chemical splitting of water.

Synopsis
Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 releases 0.167 M [O]/mole at relatively low temperature (465 C) directly and subsequent generation of H2 (65 C) by thermo-splitting of water. Reversible O2 release and intake of this material is due to coupling between the Ce4+/Ce3+ and Cr4+/6+/Cr3+ redox couples in fluorite structure.
Introduction
The utilization of hydrogen (H2) energy as a clean energy is a solution to solve global environmental problems and exhaustion of natural energy resources. Water is the most abundant molecular compound on Earth: it is omnipresent and essential for life. Water is a stable compound because of its high formation enthalpy of 286 kJ mol1, and thus the splitting of water in to H2 and O2 is a high-energy process. The thermal splitting of water requires temperatures above 2500 C. In the theromchemical process, hydrogen is generated at a lower temperature by involving different chemical reactions than the direct thermal decomposition of water in to H2 and O2. One of the simplest examples of such a cycle is generation of H2 by two-step water splitting involving the metal oxide redox pair in the thermochemical cycle. (1-3) They can be represented as follows.

H2 generation step

Redox systems of FeO/Fe3O4, CoO/Co3O4, MnO/Mn3O4, Zn/ZnO have been studied for two-step water splitting. (2-5) A cerium oxide process has been reported by Abanades and Flamant. (6) The process uses a CeO2/Ce2O3 redox pair and reaction occurs in two step process as follows

The amount of lattice oxygen that can be reversibly exchanged from CeO2 is called oxygen storage capacity. (7, 8) CeO2 is a fantastic material utilized in exhaust catalysis because of its oxygen storage capacity (OSC). Substitutions of other transition metal ion in CeO2 are shown to enhance the OSC of Ce1xMxO2 (Zr, Ti). (9-13) It means lattice oxygen is activated and can be removed relatively easily. So substitution of other transition metal will not only enhance the OSC but can also bring down the oxygen releasing temperature. Indeed CeO2MOx (M = Mn, Fe, Cu, and Ni) mixed oxide solid solutions have shown higher amount of oxygen release at relatively low temperature (1400 C) than CeO2 and their subsequent utilization for generation of hydrogen from water splitting at lower temperature. (14)
In our efforts to search for new high OSC materials for exhaust catalysis we have developed OSC materials such as Ce1xTixO2 (0  x  0.40), (12) Ce1xSnxO2 (0 x  0.50), (15) Ce1xCrxO2.11 (0  x  0.33), (16) which have shown very high OSC at lower temperature. Among these OSC materials, Ce0.67Cr0.33O2+δ not only has shown higher OSC capacity than Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 but it also releases lattice oxygen directly at much lower temperature (300 C). (16) In this paper, we report the study of O2 evolution and the generation of H2 by thermochemical splitting of water over Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 catalyst. Oxygen release starts around 300 C from Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 but for higher O2 release and taking the stability of the material into account as well, we studied oxygen release at 465 C and H2 generation from water splitting starts at as low a temperature as 65 C over this material.
Experimental Section
Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 was synthesized by hydrothermal method represented in our earlier work. (16) In a typical synthesis, 6.7 mM Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 was dissolved in 20 mL of water and 3.3 mM CrO3 was dissolved in 15 mL of water. Both the solutions were mixed, and 0.03 M (3.1 mL) of diethylenetriamine was added. The resulting dark yellow colored gel formed was transferred in three autoclave bomb of 20 mL size with 75% of filling. The autoclave bombs were heated at 200 C for 24 h in a hot air oven. After reaction resulting solid was centrifuged and dried at 110 C. The solid product was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). X-ray diffraction patterns of all samples were recorded in a Phillips XPert diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at scan rate of 0.25 min1 with 0.01 step size in the 2θ range between 10 and 90. Structures were refined by Rietveld method, using FullProf-fp2k program. (17)
Composition is also confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis (JEOL JSM 5600LV scanning electron microscope). To know the oxidation states of the elements in the compound, we recorded X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) on a Thermoscientific Multilab 2000 equipment employing Al Kα X-rays at 150W. XPS binding energies are accurate within 0.1 eV. A thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was carried out on a home-built apparatus in air in the temperature range 30500 C at a heating rate of 4 C/min.
Oxygen evolution and hydrogen generation experiments were done in a micro reactor of length 30 and 0.4 cm internal diameter with ultra high pure (UHP) N2 (certified calibration gas mixture from Bhoruka gases Ltd., India) flowing at 100 sccm. Oxygen evolution experiments were done over 350 mg of compound by heating it at 465 C for 1 h and hydrogen generation experiments were done by cooling the sample to 50 C in water vapor along with N2. The flow of water vapor was then stopped and the sample was heated in UHP N2 at 65 C to release hydrogen. The generated oxygen and hydrogen gases were analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC). Total amount of hydrogen generated is also measured gravimetrically by passing the generated hydrogen over CuO at 300 C. The amount of hydrogen is calculated from the weight loss of CuO because of its reduction to Cu by H2 generated through water splitting.
Result and discussion
The powder XRD pattern of as prepared Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 is shown in Figure 1(a). Powder X-ray pattern is indexed to fluorite structure. The Rietveld refined XRD profile of Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 is shown in Figure 2. Structural parameters of Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 obtained by Rietveld refinement of powder XRD data are summarized in Table 1. Thermal stability of compound is studied by heating the compound in furnace at different temperature. The compound is stable up to 550 C. Powder XRD pattern of sample heated at 550 C is shown in Figure 1(b) and no diffraction lines were observed either for Cr2O3, CrO2, or Cr metal in powder XRD pattern. But when heated at 600 C for 2 h, impurity peaks for Cr2O3 are observed in the powder XRD pattern (not shown).

Structure, composition, oxygen storage capacity and oxygen evolution have been described in details in our previous work. (16) Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 shows high oxygen storage capacity and oxygen release by heating in air. The compound (Ce2/3Cr1/3O2.11) was heated under flow of He and gaseous products were analyzed by means of a quadrupole mass spectrometer. There were no additional peaks observed except O2 evolution with M/e at 32 was indeed observed, which was increasing with increasing temperature. O2 evolution plot is given in our earlier paper. (16) Oxygen evolution in this material starts around 200 C. To see the nature and the amount of oxygen evolution, TGA of the sample is done in UHP N2. From the TG curve in Figure 3, it is clear that weight loss is continuous after 200 C, a small plateau is found around 450 C, and then fast weight loss is observed. The weight loss is around 1.1% up to 450 C, which is equivalent to 0.1 mol of [O]. From TGA plot, the total weight loss up to 550 C is 3.1%, which corresponds to 0.28 mol of O/mol of compound. We have chosen oxygen removal experiment at 465 C because weight loss is fast after 450 C and the compound is also stable at this temperature. The schematic diagram of experimental set up for O2 release and H2 generation experiment is shown in Figure 4. Oxygen release experiment is done by heating the sample in UHP N2 at 465 C until O2 evolution is observed in a GC. The amount of evolved oxygen is calculated by calibrating the GC signal for evolved oxygen signal against the oxygen signal for known composition of O2 in N2. The oxygen evolution plot is shown for three cycles in Figure 5ac.

By taking 144.8 as the molecular weight of compound Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11, the amount of [O] released are 0.148, 0.186, and 0.163 M [O]/mol of oxide, respectively, for first, third, and fifth cycles. Average oxygen release with six consecutive cycles is 0.167 mol of O/mol of oxide. Values for each cycle are given in table 2. For H2 generation, compound is heated in a N2 flow at 465 C until oxygen evolution stops completely. Water vapor is passed along with N2 and compound is cooled up to 50 C under water vapor but no H2 signal is detected, we stopped the water vapor flow and under N2 flow only we heated the compound at 65 C and hydrogen evolution was observed. Compound is heated at this temperature until the H2 signal stopped. The H2 signal observed after stopping the water vapor flow and heating under N2 only because in the presence of high partial pressure of H2O vapor, H2O dissociation does not occur; similarly, no H2 detection/release is observed when water vapor is passed at higher temperature (450 C). As seen from TGA, the rate of oxygen evolution is highest around 450 C. Therefore, material can not be oxidized by O2 or H2O at this temperature at atmospheric pressure. The compound starts losing weight by heating in air and weight loss starts around 200 C (16) When the compound is cooled below the oxygen desorption temperature, oxidation is expected. That is why we need to cool the compound below 100 C. O2 is released from pure CeO2 at 2000 C and for CeO2MOx (M = Fe, Mn, Cu, and Ni) is around 13001500 C and the reduced compound is reoxidized at lower temperature 500 C by water. (6, 14) By the substitution of Cr4+/6+ ion in CeO2, the oxygen evolution temperature is brought down to 465 C and H2 generation temperature at 65 C.

The amount of evolved H2 is calculated by calibrating the GC signal for evolved hydrogen signal against the H2 signal for known composition of H2 in N2. The hydrogen generation plot is shown for three cycles in Figure 6ac at 65 C. By taking the molecular weight of the compound to be 144.8, the amount of H2 generated is 0.133, 0.146, and 0.152 M H2/mol of oxide in the first, third, and fifth cycles, respectively. The amount of H2 generated in each cycle are given in Table 2. Evolved H2 is also estimated gravimetrically by passing the generated hydrogen over a known weight of CuO in a reactor heated continuously at 300 C. From the weight-loss of CuO, because of formation of Cu metal by the reduction with generated H2, the amount of H2 is calculated. Details of H2 generated by gravimetric analysis are also given in Table 2. There is a good agreement in amount of generated H2 estimated by GC experiment and estimated gravimetrically by CuO reduction to Cu. H2 generation is repeated of for 8 cycle by heating the compound in N2 until O2 evolution stops and further cooling in H2O vapor along with N2 up to 50 C then again heating at 65 C in N2 only. The hydrogen generation step was tried at a higher temperature also. The rate of H2 generation was increasing with increasing the water splitting temperature, but the amount of H2 generated was decreased; for example, at 120 C, it was 0.16 and at 210 C, it was 0.13 mol/mol of compound. This is because O2 evolution starts around 200 C in N2 (Figure 3) from this material and it may reduce the reoxidation process.

Figure 6. H2 evolution curve for (ac) 1st, 3rd, and 5th cycles, respectively, by heating the material at 65 C under a N2 flow.
After performing the hydrogen generation experiment for 8 cycles by first heating the compound to release O2 and then passing water vapor to generate H2, we recharacterized the compound by XRD and XPS. There was no impurity peak in the powder XRD pattern shown in Figure 1c and diffraction lines are to index to fluorite structure only. Rietveld refined powder XRD pattern is also shown in Figure 7. Details of structure parameters of material after H2 generation cycle are given in Table 1. There is no significant variation in lattice parameters of the material before and after several cycling. Oxidation state of material is characterized by XPS. XPS spectra of Cr(2p) and Ce(3d) region of Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 after 8 cycles of H2 generations is shown in Figures 8a and 9a, respectively. XPS of Cr(2p) and Ce(3d) region of as-prepared Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 sample before cycling is also given for comparison in Figures 8b and 9b, respectively. There is no change in Cr (2p) spectra of the compound after hydrogen generation cycle as Cr exists in mixed-valence state Cr(2p3/2)(IV) and Cr(2p3/2)(VI) state in a ratio of 2:1, only with B.E. at 576.9 and 579.3 eV, which matches with the as-prepared sample where Cr(2p) also exists in mixed (IV) and (VI) states with the ratio of 2:1. (16) CrO2 is a metallic oxide. Therefore, Cr(3d) electrons are delocalized. When a core hole (Cr(2p6) to Cr(2p5)+e) is created due to photo ionization, electrons are transferred to the core hole by free electron in conduction band, unlike in the case of an insulating oxide such as Cr2O3. Therefore binding energy of Cr4+(2p3/2) at 576.3 eV in CrO2 (18) is lower than Cr3+(2p3/2) at 576.8 eV in Cr2O3. (19) Cr ion-substituted CeO2 is not conducting. In fact, it is insulating and Cr ion is in an insulating environment as in Cr2O3 and therefore Cr4+(2p3/2) core level binding energy is higher that Cr3+(2p3/2) core level, which is actually observed. Binding energies for the Cr4+(2p3/2) and Cr6+(2p3/2) state are observed at 576.9 and 579.3 eV and the Cr6+(2p3/2) binding energy is the same as in the CrO42 ion in K2CrO4, which is also insulating. Further Cr3+(2p3/2) ion is observed at 576.4 eV in the H2 reduced Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 up to 550C. Cr4+(2p3/2) observed at 576.6 eV instead of 576.3 eV when CrO2 film was grown over TiO2 film, which is again a semiconductor. (20) So from XPS study presence of Cr ion in 4+ and 6+ state in Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 is confirmed.

Further electronic state of Cr ion in Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 is also investigated by Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra of Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 and pure CeO2 are given in Figure 10 (a) and (b) respectively. Raman band at 462 cm-1 in Figure 10(a) is assigned as phonon mode stretching for symmetric breathing mode of oxygen atoms around cerium atom (21) and other band observed at 842 cm1 in figure 10(a) is close to V1 (Ag +B2 g) stretching band of CrO42- at 853 cm1 in K2CrO4 (22) and (CrOCr) vibration for chromate ion. (23) There is no band observed at 543 cm1, which is characteristic band for Cr2O3. (24) So Raman spectroscopy study also reveals the absence of Cr3+ and presence of Cr6+ in Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11.Ce(3d) spectrum of the compound after hydrogen generation cycle also shows that Ce is only in 4+ state with Ce(3d5/2) at 881.8 eV and a characteristic satellite peak at 916.8 eV. There is no change in the compound either in crystal structure or in electronic structure after hydrogen generation cycles, showing the material is robust for H2 generation and O2 evolution. So with these details, the mechanism of H2 generation is represented in Figure 11 and the reaction can be described as follows
In conclusion, 0.167 mol of [O] evolved at 465 C from Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 and corresponding H2 generation at 65 C.The amount of hydrogen generated is lower than pure CeO26 and comparable to CeO2-MOx14. But oxygen release and H2 formation temperature with Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 are far lower than pure CeO26 and CeO2-MOx14. So the oxygen evolution reaction can be written as
Because of redox potentials of CeIV/CeIII (1.61 V) (25) and CrVI/CrIII(1.33 V), (25) Cr3+ will get oxidized by Ce4+ reduction and the reaction occurs as follows
and because in the fluorite the CeO2 lattice Ce4+ exist in 8 coordination, Ce3+ in the fluorite lattice will be highly unstable and can get oxidized by O2 or H2O; the reaction can written as
That is why compound shows reversible oxygen release and intake by H2O absorption and subsequent hydrogen release to gain the parent structure and hence this material can not only act as very high oxygen release/storage material but also can be utilized for generation of H2 by thermo-chemical splitting of water.
