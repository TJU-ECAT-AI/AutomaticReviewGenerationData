[1] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."

[2] "Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown). We obtained very similar results forAuxCe1xO2 [27]. Moreover, doping TiO2 with Pt, Pd, Cu, Ni and Ag weakens the bond of the surface oxygen to the oxide even more than doping with Au (see table 1)."

[3] "It may seem strange that Cu or Ni are capable of weakening the bond of the surface oxygen to the oxide, more than Au, even though the Cu and Ni oxides are more stable than those of Au (Cu and Ni have higher affinity for oxygen than Au). This happens for several reasons. First, Cu and Ni are not capable of making compounds with the formal charge of 4+ and the oxygen surrounding them (when they are dopants) see an electron deficit, which weakens their ability to bond."

[4] "A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxygen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction."

The literature does not directly address same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) or make distinctions between them. However, it provides insights into how various metal dopants influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly TiO2 and CeO2.

The study shows that doping TiO2 and CeO2 with metals like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni significantly weakens the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, enhancing their potential as oxidation catalysts. This effect occurs even when the dopant is in the sublayer of the oxide.

Interestingly, dopants like Cu and Ni, which typically form more stable oxides than Au, can weaken the surface oxygen bond more effectively than Au. This is attributed to their inability to form compounds with a 4+ charge state, creating an electron deficit around the oxygen atoms near the dopant.

The research emphasizes that an effective oxidation catalyst in this class of materials requires a balance between the ability to donate oxygen during oxidation and the ability to replenish oxygen from the gas phase to fill vacancies. This balance is crucial for maintaining catalyst stability and efficiency.

The study does not provide general predictive rules for dopant behavior, as it focuses on specific metal-oxide combinations. However, it highlights the complexity of factors influencing catalytic performance, including the charge state of the dopant, its coordination environment, and its effect on the electronic structure of surrounding atoms.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules likely stem from the complex interplay of factors such as dopant size, charge state, and electronic configuration, as well as the properties of the host oxide. The study suggests that these interactions can lead to counterintuitive results, as seen with Cu and Ni dopants.

While the research doesn't explicitly discuss Lewis acid-base interactions or compare reducible and irreducible oxides, it implies that the electronic properties of the dopant-oxide system, including charge transfer and electron localization, play a crucial role in determining catalytic behavior.

该文献并未直接讨论同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)，也没有对它们进行区分。然而，它提供了关于各种金属掺杂剂如何影响金属氧化物（特别是TiO2和CeO2）的催化性能的见解。

研究表明，用Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni等金属掺杂TiO2和CeO2会显著削弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键，从而提高它们作为氧化催化剂的潜力。即使掺杂剂在氧化物的亚层中，这种效果也会发生。

有趣的是，Cu和Ni等通常形成比Au更稳定氧化物的掺杂剂，可以比Au更有效地削弱表面氧键。这是由于它们无法形成4+电荷状态的化合物，在掺杂剂附近的氧原子周围产生电子缺失。

研究强调，这类材料中有效的氧化催化剂需要在氧化过程中提供氧的能力和从气相中补充氧以填补空位的能力之间取得平衡。这种平衡对于维持催化剂的稳定性和效率至关重要。

该研究没有提供掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则，因为它主要关注特定的金属-氧化物组合。然而，它强调了影响催化性能的因素的复杂性，包括掺杂剂的电荷状态、其配位环境以及对周围原子电子结构的影响。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则的挑战可能源于诸多因素的复杂相互作用，如掺杂剂的大小、电荷状态和电子构型，以及主体氧化物的性质。研究表明，这些相互作用可能导致反直觉的结果，如Cu和Ni掺杂剂所示。

虽然研究没有明确讨论Lewis酸碱相互作用或比较可还原和不可还原的氧化物，但它暗示掺杂剂-氧化物系统的电子性质，包括电荷转移和电子局域化，在决定催化行为方面起着关键作用。
