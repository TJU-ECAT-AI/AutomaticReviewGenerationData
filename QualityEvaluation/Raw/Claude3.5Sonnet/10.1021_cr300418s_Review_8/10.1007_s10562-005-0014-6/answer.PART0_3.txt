The literature does not directly address the distinction between same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) in metal oxides. However, it provides insights into how various metal dopants influence the catalytic properties of TiO2 and CeO2.

The study shows that doping TiO2 with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni significantly weakens the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, making them better oxidation catalysts. This effect is observed for both reducible (TiO2) and irreducible (CeO2) oxides.

Computational studies using density functional theory reveal that doping dramatically reduces the energy required to remove surface oxygen atoms. For example, in Au-doped TiO2, the vacancy formation energy is much lower compared to undoped TiO2.

The research suggests that while copper doping produces the greatest weakening of the oxygen-oxide bond, this doesn't necessarily translate to the best catalytic performance. A balance between oxygen donation and vacancy healing is crucial for an effective catalyst.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior are implied by the complex interplay of factors affecting catalytic performance. The study emphasizes the need to consider both the ability to donate oxygen and to heal oxygen vacancies, which can vary depending on the specific dopant and host oxide.

While the paper doesn't explicitly discuss Lewis acid-base interactions, the observed effects on oxygen binding and reactivity likely involve such interactions between the dopants and the oxide surface.

Overall, the study provides valuable insights into dopant effects on metal oxide catalysts but also highlights the complexity of these systems and the need for further research to develop comprehensive predictive models.

该文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物中同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)的区别。然而，它提供了关于各种金属掺杂剂如何影响TiO2和CeO2催化性能的见解。

研究表明，用Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni掺杂TiO2会显著削弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键合，使它们成为更好的氧化催化剂。这种效果在可还原(TiO2)和不可还原(CeO2)氧化物中都有观察到。

使用密度泛函理论的计算研究表明，掺杂显著降低了移除表面氧原子所需的能量。例如，在Au掺杂的TiO2中，空位形成能量比未掺杂的TiO2低得多。

研究表明，虽然铜掺杂产生了最大的氧-氧化物键削弱效果，但这并不一定转化为最佳的催化性能。氧供给和空位愈合之间的平衡对于有效的催化剂至关重要。

在制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则方面的挑战，体现在影响催化性能的因素的复杂相互作用上。研究强调需要同时考虑供氧能力和愈合氧空位的能力，这些能力可能因特定的掺杂剂和宿主氧化物而异。

虽然论文没有明确讨论路易斯酸碱相互作用，但观察到的氧结合和反应性影响可能涉及掺杂剂和氧化物表面之间的这种相互作用。

总的来说，这项研究为金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂剂效应提供了宝贵的见解，但也突出了这些系统的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以开发全面预测模型的必要性。
