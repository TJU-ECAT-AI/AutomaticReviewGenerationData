[1] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."

[2] "Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown). We obtained very similar results forAuxCe1xO2 [27]. Moreover, doping TiO2 with Pt, Pd, Cu, Ni and Ag weakens the bond of the surface oxygen to the oxide even more than doping with Au (see table 1)."

[3] "A good oxidation catalyst in this class of compounds requires a fine balance between the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation."

[4] "It is well known that density functional theory does not describe correctly the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth oxides. Theory predicts that these compounds are metals, while experiments show them to be antiferromagnetic Mott insulators."

The literature does not directly discuss same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs). However, it provides insights on how various metal dopants influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly TiO2 and CeO2.

Computational studies using density functional theory (DFT) show that doping TiO2 and CeO2 with metals like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni significantly weakens the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide. This weakening of the oxygen bond makes the doped oxides better oxidation catalysts.

The study suggests that the effectiveness of a dopant is not solely determined by its ability to weaken the oxygen bond. A good oxidation catalyst requires a balance between the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation. This balance is crucial for maintaining catalyst stability and activity.

The literature highlights challenges in using DFT for studying doped oxides. DFT does not accurately describe the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth oxides, predicting them as metals when experiments show them to be antiferromagnetic Mott insulators. This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of DFT in predicting dopant behavior and energetics in these systems.

The study does not provide general predictive rules for dopant behavior or discuss factors like Lewis acid-base interactions. It also does not differentiate between the effects of dopants on reducible versus irreducible oxides. These aspects remain as challenges in understanding and predicting dopant behavior in metal oxide catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)。然而，它提供了关于各种金属掺杂剂如何影响金属氧化物催化性能的见解，特别是对TiO2和CeO2的影响。

使用密度泛函理论(DFT)的计算研究表明，用Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni等金属掺杂TiO2和CeO2会显著削弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键合。这种氧键的削弱使得掺杂的氧化物成为更好的氧化催化剂。

研究表明，掺杂剂的有效性不仅仅取决于其削弱氧键的能力。一个好的氧化催化剂需要在氧化物还原和氧化速率之间保持平衡。这种平衡对于维持催化剂的稳定性和活性至关重要。

文献强调了使用DFT研究掺杂氧化物的挑战。DFT无法准确描述过渡金属和稀土氧化物的电子结构，预测它们为金属，而实验表明它们是反铁磁莫特绝缘体。这种差异引发了对DFT在预测这些系统中掺杂剂行为和能量学方面准确性的质疑。

该研究没有提供掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则，也没有讨论路易斯酸碱相互作用等因素。它也没有区分掺杂剂对可还原氧化物和不可还原氧化物的影响。这些方面仍然是理解和预测金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂行为的挑战。
