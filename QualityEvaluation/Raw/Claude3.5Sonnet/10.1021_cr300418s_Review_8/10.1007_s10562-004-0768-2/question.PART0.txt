In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr.
VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related. That active Au on titania
spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created
by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen, is convincing evidence that the same basic
principles responsible for activation of Au on titania are operative for SMSI involving Gr. VIII metals.
KEY WORDS: gold, titania, CO oxidation, strong metal support interaction, SMSI.
The enhanced catalytic activity of small gold clusters
has been ascribed to a number of effects: bilayer
structures
that
exhibit
metalnonmetal
transitions
[13], the metal-support interface [47], uncoordinated
step- and corner atoms [811], strain [11], charge
transfer from the support [12, 13], and metal cationic
sites [14]. Early work on model Au clusters supported on
TiO2(110) correlated the presence of Au bilayer cluster
morphologies (figure 1) with catalytic activity for CO
oxidation [1]. These bilayer Au structures have been
shown to bind CO approximately 50% more strongly
than bulk Au (figure 2) [15]. Furthermore oxygen either
alone or in a reaction mixture has been shown to
promote
sintering
of
these
bilayer
Au
structures
(figure 3) [1]. A recent model study [16] of Au on a
highly reduced TiOx ordered film grown on Mo(112) has
demonstrated that a coordinatively unsaturated, con-
tinuous Au bilayer structure that precludes assess of the
reactant to the support, exhibits an exceptional high
activity for catalytic CO oxidation (figure 4). The
activity of this Au bilayer film is more than an order
of magnitude more active than any previous report on a
per Au atom basis [16]. A key feature of Au grown on
TiOx/Mo(112) is the strength of the interaction between
the overlayer Au and the support comprised of strong
bonding between Au and reduced Ti atoms of the TiOx
support, yielding electron-rich Au [16]. These recent
studies are entirely consistent with recent theoretical
studies [17] that show the importance of reduced Ti
defect sites at the boundary between Au clusters and a
TiO2 interface in determining the Au cluster shape and
electronic properties via transfer of charge from the
support to Au [18]. Finally a recent theoretical study [19]
has shown that a Au-only reaction pathway for a TiOx
supported Au bilayer cluster is energetically competitive
with alternative pathways requiring reactant-support
interactions.
In summary the essential features of the interaction of
Au with TiO2 that lead to enhanced catalytic activity
are: (1) wetting of the support by the cluster; (2) strong
bonding between the Au atoms at the interface with
surface defects (reduced Ti sites); (3) electron-rich Au;
(4) annealing at temperatures in excess of 750 K,
sufficient to create and mobilize surface and bulk
defects, is crucial in preparing an active catalyst; and
(5) oxidation leads to deactivation via sintering of Au.
In the late seventies and eighties considerable atten-
tion
was
given
the
unusual
properties
of
metals
supported on TiO2 when reduced at relatively high
temperatures, results first reported by Tauster et al.
for supported Pt and Ir [20], and designated as strong
metal-support
interaction
(SMSI).
Associated
with
SMSI were: (i) CO and H2 chemisorption suppression
[20,21]; (ii) an increase of methanation activity [22,23];
and (iii) a decrease in hydrogenolysis activity [24]. For
example, Tauster et al. [20,21] showed that H2 and CO
chemisorption on highly dispersed titania-supported
catalysts was suppressed. Vannice et al. [23,25,26], and
Bartholomew et al. [27,28], found similar results for
titania supported Ni. In addition, the methane yield for
titania supported Ni was found to increase by an order
of magnitude and the product distribution shifted
toward higher hydrocarbons compared with unsup-
ported Ni or Ni on other supports [23,25,27,28]. Chung
et al. [29,30] and others [31] studied metals deposited on
single crystal TiO2 and determined that electron transfer
occurs from the titania support to the metal; theory also
supported this conclusion [32]. Work by Huizinga and
Prins [33] as well as Baker et al. [34], showed that the
formation of suboxides of titania in the vicinity of

reduction causes spreading of the metal while treatment
in O2 leads to agglomeration of the metal.
These and numerous other researchers in the eighties
addressed the SMSI phenomenon and reached the
following general conclusions [31,35, and references
therein]:
(1)
high
temperature
reduction
leads
to
spreading of the metal on the support; (2) strong
bonding occurs between the metal and reduced (sub-
oxide) support; (3) interaction between the metal and
the support leads to the metal becoming electron-rich;
(4) reduction temperatures in excess of 750 K lead to
SMSI; and (5) SMSI effects are reversed in oxidative
environments.
In light of the many similarities between previous
studies
of
SMSI
involving
Gr.
VIII
metals
and
catalytically active Au, it is clear that these two
phenomena are very closely related. In fact, that active
Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is
electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment,
nucleates on reduced Ti defects made by annealing to
temperatures >750 K, and sinters in the presence of
oxygen is strong evidence that the same basic principles
responsible for activation of Au on titania are respon-
sible for SMSI involving Gr. VIII metals.
Specifically the following parallels can be drawn
between catalytically active Au on TiO2 and the SMSI
effect:
(1) Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K is the typical con-
dition required to induce SMSI. This temperature
has been shown to be sufficient to create surface
defects in model studies of single crystal TiO2 [36]
and to be critical in the nucleation and growth
morphology of Au clusters [37]. A recent study of
supported Au on titania has shown that catalysts
prepared at temperatures near 800 K exhibit higher
activity and higher dispersion [38].
(2) Inducement of SMSI leads to wetting of the support
by the metal [34]. Scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) studies of model Au/TiO2 catalysts have
shown that Au wets titania subsequent to an anneal
to 800 K [1].
(3) With SMSI electron transfer occurs from titania to
the supported metal yielding an electron-rich metal

[29,30]. For an active Au/TiO2 model catalyst, core
level shifts measured by X-ray photoelectron spec-
troscopy (XPS) are consistent with electron transfer
from titania to Au leading to electron-rich Au [3].
Density functional calculations also are consistent
with Au being electron-rich when supported on
titania [18,39].
(4) When induced, SMSI leads to suppression of H2
and CO chemisorption for various metals [22,23].
On the other hand, for an active Au/TiO2 catalyst
CO chemisorption is enhanced [15,38], presumably
because electron transfer from titania to Au leads
to destabilization of the d-band and to enhanced
back-bonding from Au to CO [18,39]. For Gr. VIII
SMSI metals electron transfer from the support to
the metal and the accompanying destabilization of
the d-band may actually lead to a reduction in the
metal back-bonding to CO. That is, a similar elec-
tronic interaction between the metal and the sup-
port for Au compared to Gr. VIII metals may
produce a decidedly different chemical (catalytic)
result.
(5) Oxidative environments reoxidize the reduced TiOx
support and reverse the SMSI effect [30]. Similarly, for
Au on titania an oxidizing environment re-oxidizes the
TiOx support [41] causing de-wetting and sintering of
the Au [1].
There is one outstanding discrepancy in the compar-
ison of SMSI and catalytically active Au. This discrep-
ancy is the assertion that SMSI arises from migration of
a reduced TiOx, perhaps TiO, onto the supported metal
causing inhibition of chemisorption and modified cata-
lytic properties [31,42]. No such evidence exists for a
similar migration of a TiOx species onto an active Au/
TiO2
catalyst.
This
discrepancy
could
be
due
to
the logical, yet possibly incorrect, interpretation of the
original data used to deduce migration of TiOx onto
the metal during SMSI. Indeed for a Au/TiO2 catalyst,
inspection shows an enhancement of reduced titania
species for the active catalyst compared to a deactivated
catalyst due to the critical role of defect sites in the
wetting of titania by Au, i.e., the enhancement of TiOx
at the cluster-support interface [17]. Assuming this
accumulation of defects at the cluster-support interface
occurs as well during SMSI formation, this could easily
be interpreted as TiOx formation on the cluster because
the metal bilayer structure that we now know forms on
TiO2 is relatively transparent to electron probes such as
XPS. Likewise, an increase in the Ti feature in low
energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) as a function
of anneal temperature, interpreted as migration of TiO

onto the metal, could be simply due to the improved
accessibility of the probe ions to Ti because of the
decrease in the oxygen stoichiometry during reduction.
Finally, there is the possibility that decoration occurs for
Gr. VIII metals but does not for Au. Nonetheless, the
essential feature for the activation of both systems is
the strong interaction between the metal and defects
formed at the surface of the reduced support at elevated
temperatures, and the de-wetting and sintering of the Au
in an oxidizing environment.
In any case, future work on catalytically active Au on
TiO2 and other supports known to activate Au should
be considered in the context of the extensive SMSI
literature of the last 30 years. Additional work viewed in
this perspective most certainly will illuminate the origin
of the exciting and unique properties of catalytically
active Au as well as uncover many of the remaining
mysteries associated with the SMSI effect.
