[1] "High-valence dopants in an irreducible oxide have a different behavior than in a reducible one."

[2] "If CeO2 is doped with Nb or Ta, these pentavalent dopants lose an electron, which fills an f-orbital localized on a Ce ion. The formal valence of this Ce ion is 3+."

[3] "When it replaces a Zr atom in ZrO2, a Ta atom can use only four of its five valence electrons. The unused electron stays on the Ta dopant, turning it into a strong Lewis base."

[4] "To explore this question, it is simplest to consider that O2 adsorption changed the dopant from D to DO2. Since the oxygen uses some of the extra electrons in D, DO2 has fewer electrons to affect the host oxide than D."

[5] "Calculations show that indeed it does. In Figure 3 we show the NiO(011) surface doped with NbO2. We marked two of the oxygen atoms as A and B. Making an oxygen vacancy by removing the atom A requires 2.31 eV, and making a vacancy by removing B costs 2.67 eV. This is substantially lower than the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy on the undoped surface, which is 3.28 eV."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides differently depending on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible. 

In reducible oxides like CeO2, HVDs like Nb or Ta lose an electron to reduce a Ce4+ ion to Ce3+. This electron transfer affects the oxide's redox properties and can influence its catalytic behavior.

In irreducible oxides like ZrO2, HVDs like Ta retain their extra electrons, becoming strong Lewis bases. This basicity can enhance the adsorption of acidic species and modify surface reactivity.

HVDs can also interact with gas-phase species like O2, forming DO2 complexes. This changes the electronic structure of the dopant and its effect on the host oxide. For example, NbO2 dopants in NiO(011) act as low-valence dopants, facilitating oxygen vacancy formation and potentially enhancing oxidation catalysis.

Computational studies have provided insights into these behaviors, revealing how dopants modify surface energetics and reactivity. However, formulating general predictive rules remains challenging due to the complex interplay between dopant type, host oxide nature, and gas-phase interactions.

Factors complicating prediction include:
1. The reducibility of the host oxide
2. Lewis acid-base interactions between dopants, the oxide, and adsorbates
3. Formation of dopant-adsorbate complexes (e.g., DO2)
4. Changes in dopant behavior upon gas adsorption

Further research is needed to develop more comprehensive models accounting for these diverse factors and their implications for catalytic performance.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对金属氧化物的催化性能的影响取决于宿主氧化物是可还原的还是不可还原的。

在可还原的氧化物(如CeO2)中,HVDs(如Nb或Ta)会失去一个电子来将Ce4+离子还原为Ce3+。这种电子转移影响氧化物的氧化还原性质,从而影响其催化行为。

在不可还原的氧化物(如ZrO2)中,HVDs(如Ta)保留其额外的电子,成为强Lewis碱。这种碱性可以增强酸性物种的吸附,改变表面反应活性。

HVDs还可以与气相物种(如O2)相互作用,形成DO2复合物。这改变了掺杂剂的电子结构及其对宿主氧化物的影响。例如,NiO(011)中的NbO2掺杂剂作为低价掺杂剂,促进氧空位的形成,可能增强氧化催化作用。

计算研究为这些行为提供了见解,揭示了掺杂剂如何改变表面能量和反应活性。然而,由于掺杂剂类型、宿主氧化物性质和气相相互作用之间的复杂相互作用,制定通用的预测规则仍然具有挑战性。

使预测复杂化的因素包括:
1. 宿主氧化物的可还原性
2. 掺杂剂、氧化物和吸附质之间的Lewis酸碱相互作用
3. 掺杂剂-吸附质复合物的形成(如DO2)
4. 气体吸附后掺杂剂行为的变化

需要进一步研究来开发更全面的模型,以考虑这些不同因素及其对催化性能的影响。
