[1] "High-valence dopants in an irreducible oxide have a different behavior than in a reducible one. To illustrate the difference, we contrast the effect of Ta dopant in ZrO2 and in CeO2."

[2] "If the HVD is a weak base, it will adsorb O2, but it will not neutralize completely its acidity. Therefore, O2 will react readily with bases such as CO, H, or CH3."

[3] "Calculations show that indeed it does. If ZnO is doped with Ti (or Al), the oxygen molecule adsorbs on the dopant. The Bader charge on O2 increases, and the bond length of the adsorbed molecule is larger than that of the gas-phase molecule."

[4] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic"

[5] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."

The influence of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of metal oxides varies depending on the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) and the strength of the dopant as a Lewis base.

For irreducible oxides:
- HVDs act as strong Lewis bases, increasing the difficulty of oxygen vacancy formation.
- Weak HVDs can adsorb O2 without fully neutralizing its acidity, allowing it to react with other bases like CO, H, or CH3.
- Strong HVDs may completely neutralize adsorbed O2, potentially turning the doped surface into a Lewis acid (e.g., NbO2 in NiO).

For reducible oxides:
- HVDs may donate electrons to reduce cations in the host oxide, potentially neutralizing their basicity.
- The behavior of HVDs in reducible oxides is more complex and less predictable.

Low-valence dopants (LVDs) generally act as Lewis acids in both reducible and irreducible oxides, lowering the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increasing the binding energy of bases to the surface.

Computational and experimental studies have provided insights into these behaviors, such as:
- The effect of Ti or Al doping in ZnO on O2 adsorption and activation.
- The contrasting effects of Ta doping in ZrO2 (irreducible) vs. CeO2 (reducible).
- The role of reducible oxides as Lewis acids in lowering vacancy formation energy and increasing metal atom binding.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:
1. The complex interplay between dopant properties, host oxide nature, and Lewis acid-base interactions.
2. The varying strength of Lewis acidity/basicity among dopants and host oxides.
3. The potential for dopants to change their behavior upon adsorption of species like O2.
4. The need to consider both electronic and structural effects of doping.

These factors make it difficult to establish universally applicable rules, necessitating careful consideration of each specific system and the use of advanced computational methods to predict dopant behavior accurately.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物催化性能的影响因主体氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）和掺杂剂作为路易斯碱的强度而异。

对于不可还原的氧化物：
- HVDs作为强路易斯碱，增加了氧空位形成的难度。
- 弱HVDs可以吸附O2而不完全中和其酸性，使其能与CO、H或CH3等其他碱反应。
- 强HVDs可能完全中和吸附的O2，potentially将掺杂表面转变为路易斯酸（例如NiO中的NbO2）。

对于可还原的氧化物：
- HVDs可能会捐赠电子以还原主体氧化物中的阳离子，可能会中和它们的碱性。
- HVDs在可还原氧化物中的行为更为复杂，难以预测。

低价掺杂剂（LVDs）在可还原和不可还原的氧化物中通常都表现为路易斯酸，降低氧空位形成能，增加碱性物质与表面的结合能。

计算和实验研究为这些行为提供了洞见，例如：
- Ti或Al掺杂对ZnO中O2吸附和活化的影响。
- Ta掺杂在ZrO2（不可还原）vs. CeO2（可还原）中的对比效应。
- 可还原氧化物作为路易斯酸在降低空位形成能和增加金属原子结合方面的作用。

制定掺杂剂行为通用预测规则的挑战包括：
1. 掺杂剂性质、主体氧化物性质和路易斯酸碱相互作用之间的复杂相互影响。
2. 掺杂剂和主体氧化物之间路易斯酸/碱强度的变化。
3. 掺杂剂在吸附O2等物质后可能改变其行为的潜力。
4. 需要同时考虑掺杂的电子和结构效应。

这些因素使得建立普遍适用的规则变得困难，需要仔细考虑每个特定系统，并使用先进的计算方法来准确预测掺杂剂的行为。
