[1] "High-valence dopants in an irreducible oxide have a different behavior than in a reducible one. To illustrate the difference, we contrast the effect of Ta dopant in ZrO2 and in CeO2."

[2] "Since the oxygen uses some of the extra electrons in D, DO2 has fewer electrons to affect the host oxide than D. How does this affect surface chemistry?"

[3] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic"

[4] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."

[5] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) are not explicitly discussed in the given literature, but high-valence dopants (HVDs) and low-valence dopants (LVDs) are extensively covered.

HVDs influence metal oxides differently depending on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible. In irreducible oxides, HVDs act as Lewis bases, adsorbing Lewis acids like O2 or halogens. This can activate these adsorbed species for further reactions if the basicity of the dopant is not too strong. In reducible oxides, HVDs may donate electrons to reduce the host cations, altering the oxide's properties.

LVDs, on the other hand, turn the oxide surface into a Lewis acid. This lowers the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, increases binding energy of bases like H, CH3, and CO, and makes dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic.

Computational and experimental studies have revealed that the effects of dopants can be dramatic, sometimes changing reaction energies by several electron volts. These studies have also shown that the presence of gas-phase reactants can significantly alter the behavior of dopants, as seen with the formation of DO2 groups that can act differently from the original dopant D.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The complex interplay between the Lewis acid-base properties of the dopant, host oxide, and adsorbates.
2. The difference in behavior between reducible and irreducible oxides.
3. The potential for dopants to change their behavior in the presence of reactants or under reaction conditions.
4. The need to consider both electronic and structural effects of doping.

Despite these challenges, the Lewis acid-base framework presented in this literature provides a useful conceptual tool for understanding and predicting dopant behavior in metal oxides for catalytic applications.

虽然所给文献中没有明确讨论同价掺杂剂（SVDs），但对高价掺杂剂（HVDs）和低价掺杂剂（LVDs）进行了广泛的讨论。

HVDs对金属氧化物的影响取决于宿主氧化物是可还原的还是不可还原的。在不可还原的氧化物中，HVDs作为路易斯碱，吸附O2或卤素等路易斯酸。如果掺杂剂的碱性不是太强，这可以激活这些吸附物种进行进一步反应。在可还原的氧化物中，HVDs可能会捐赠电子以还原宿主阳离子，从而改变氧化物的性质。

另一方面，LVDs将氧化物表面转变为路易斯酸。这降低了形成氧空位所需的能量，增加了H、CH3和CO等碱的结合能，并使烷烃的解离吸附更加放热。

计算和实验研究表明，掺杂剂的影响可能是巨大的，有时会使反应能量改变几个电子伏特。这些研究还表明，气相反应物的存在可能会显著改变掺杂剂的行为，正如在形成DO2基团时所看到的，这些基团的行为可能与原始掺杂剂D不同。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的挑战包括：

1. 掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和吸附质之间路易斯酸碱性质的复杂相互作用。
2. 可还原和不可还原氧化物之间的行为差异。
3. 掺杂剂在反应物存在下或在反应条件下可能改变其行为的潜力。
4. 需要同时考虑掺杂的电子和结构效应。

尽管存在这些挑战，但本文献中提出的路易斯酸碱框架为理解和预测金属氧化物中掺杂剂在催化应用中的行为提供了有用的概念工具。
