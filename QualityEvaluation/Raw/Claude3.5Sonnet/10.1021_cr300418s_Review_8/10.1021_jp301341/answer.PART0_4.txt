[1] "High-valence dopants in an irreducible oxide have a different behavior than in a reducible one. To illustrate the difference, we contrast the effect of Ta dopant in ZrO2 and in CeO2. In ceria, a Ta dopant donates an electron to the oxide to reduce a Ce4+ to Ce3+. Such reduction does not occur when Ta dopes ZrO2 since Zr2O3 does not exist, and there is no driving force to create Zr3+."

[2] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid)."

[3] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms. The vacancy is a strong base, and the unpaired electrons produced when the oxygen atom is removed are transferred to the cations of the oxide."

[4] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs), high-valence dopants (HVDs), and low-valence dopants (LVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides in different ways, depending on the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).

For reducible oxides like CeO2, HVDs like Ta can donate electrons to reduce the host cations (e.g., Ce4+ to Ce3+), affecting the oxide's redox properties. In irreducible oxides like ZrO2, this reduction doesn't occur, and the HVD acts as a strong Lewis base.

LVDs make the oxide surface more acidic, which lowers the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, increases binding of basic species, and promotes dissociative adsorption of alkanes. This can enhance catalytic activity for certain reactions.

HVDs generally act as Lewis bases, strongly adsorbing acidic species like O2 or halogens. If the HVD's basicity is moderate, the adsorbed species remain somewhat acidic and can still react with other bases, potentially activating them for catalysis.

Reducible oxides themselves act as Lewis acids, which affects their interaction with dopants and adsorbates. This acidity lowers oxygen vacancy formation energy and increases binding of single metal atoms, both of which can impact catalytic performance.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The complex interplay between dopant properties, host oxide nature (reducible vs. irreducible), and specific reaction conditions.
2. Varying strengths of Lewis acid-base interactions depending on the particular dopant-oxide-adsorbate system.
3. Potential structural changes or electronic reorganization upon doping or during reactions.
4. Differences in behavior between bulk and surface dopants.
5. The need to consider both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of catalytic processes.

Despite these challenges, computational studies have provided valuable insights into trends and mechanisms, allowing for more rational design of doped oxide catalysts. However, continued integration of theoretical predictions with experimental validation remains crucial for advancing the field.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)、高价掺杂剂(HVDs)和低价掺杂剂(LVDs)以不同方式影响金属氧化物的催化性质，这取决于宿主氧化物的性质(可还原vs.不可还原)。

对于可还原的氧化物如CeO2，HVDs如Ta可以捐赠电子以还原宿主阳离子(例如Ce4+到Ce3+)，影响氧化物的氧化还原性质。在不可还原的氧化物如ZrO2中，这种还原不会发生，HVD作为强Lewis碱。

LVDs使氧化物表面更具酸性，这降低了氧空位形成所需的能量，增加了碱性物种的结合，并促进烷烃的解离吸附。这可以增强某些反应的催化活性。

HVDs通常作为Lewis碱，强烈吸附酸性物种如O2或卤素。如果HVD的碱性适中，吸附的物种仍然保持一定的酸性，可以与其他碱反应，可能激活它们进行催化。

可还原氧化物本身作为Lewis酸，这影响它们与掺杂剂和吸附质的相互作用。这种酸性降低了氧空位形成能，增加了单个金属原子的结合，这两者都可能影响催化性能。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的挑战包括：

1. 掺杂剂性质、宿主氧化物性质(可还原vs.不可还原)和特定反应条件之间的复杂相互作用。
2. 根据特定的掺杂剂-氧化物-吸附质系统，Lewis酸碱相互作用强度的变化。
3. 掺杂或反应过程中可能发生的结构变化或电子重组。
4. 体相和表面掺杂剂行为的差异。
5. 需要同时考虑催化过程的热力学和动力学方面。

尽管存在这些挑战，计算研究为趋势和机理提供了宝贵的见解，允许更合理地设计掺杂氧化物催化剂。然而，继续将理论预测与实验验证相结合对推进该领域仍然至关重要。
