[1] "High-valence dopants in an irreducible oxide have a different behavior than in a reducible one."

[2] "If CeO2 is doped with Nb or Ta, these pentavalent dopants lose an electron, which fills an f-orbital localized on a Ce ion. The formal valence of this Ce ion is 3+."

[3] "When it replaces a Zr atom in ZrO2, a Ta atom can use only four of its five valence electrons. The unused electron stays on the Ta dopant, turning it into a strong Lewis base."

[4] "To explore this question, it is simplest to consider that O2 adsorption changed the dopant from D to DO2. Since the oxygen uses some of the extra electrons in D, DO2 has fewer electrons to affect the host oxide than D."

[5] "Calculations show that indeed it does. In Figure 3 we show the NiO(011) surface doped with NbO2. We marked two of the oxygen atoms as A and B. Making an oxygen vacancy by removing the atom A requires 2.31 eV, and making a vacancy by removing B costs 2.67 eV. This is substantially lower than the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy on the undoped surface, which is 3.28 eV."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides differently depending on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible. 

In reducible oxides like CeO2, HVDs like Nb or Ta lose an electron to reduce a Ce4+ ion to Ce3+. This electron transfer affects the oxide's redox properties and can influence its catalytic behavior.

In irreducible oxides like ZrO2, HVDs like Ta retain their extra electrons, becoming strong Lewis bases. This basicity can enhance the adsorption of acidic species and modify surface reactivity.

HVDs can also interact with gas-phase species like O2, forming DO2 complexes. This changes the electronic structure of the dopant and its effect on the host oxide. For example, NbO2 dopants in NiO(011) act as low-valence dopants, facilitating oxygen vacancy formation and potentially enhancing oxidation catalysis.

Computational studies have provided insights into these behaviors, revealing how dopants modify surface energetics and reactivity. However, formulating general predictive rules remains challenging due to the complex interplay between dopant type, host oxide nature, and gas-phase interactions.

Factors complicating prediction include:
1. The reducibility of the host oxide
2. Lewis acid-base interactions between dopants, the oxide, and adsorbates
3. Formation of dopant-adsorbate complexes (e.g., DO2)
4. Changes in dopant behavior upon gas adsorption

Further research is needed to develop more comprehensive models accounting for these diverse factors and their implications for catalytic performance.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对金属氧化物的催化性能的影响取决于宿主氧化物是可还原的还是不可还原的。

在可还原的氧化物(如CeO2)中,HVDs(如Nb或Ta)会失去一个电子来将Ce4+离子还原为Ce3+。这种电子转移影响氧化物的氧化还原性质,从而影响其催化行为。

在不可还原的氧化物(如ZrO2)中,HVDs(如Ta)保留其额外的电子,成为强Lewis碱。这种碱性可以增强酸性物种的吸附,改变表面反应活性。

HVDs还可以与气相物种(如O2)相互作用,形成DO2复合物。这改变了掺杂剂的电子结构及其对宿主氧化物的影响。例如,NiO(011)中的NbO2掺杂剂作为低价掺杂剂,促进氧空位的形成,可能增强氧化催化作用。

计算研究为这些行为提供了见解,揭示了掺杂剂如何改变表面能量和反应活性。然而,由于掺杂剂类型、宿主氧化物性质和气相相互作用之间的复杂相互作用,制定通用的预测规则仍然具有挑战性。

使预测复杂化的因素包括:
1. 宿主氧化物的可还原性
2. 掺杂剂、氧化物和吸附质之间的Lewis酸碱相互作用
3. 掺杂剂-吸附质复合物的形成(如DO2)
4. 气体吸附后掺杂剂行为的变化

需要进一步研究来开发更全面的模型,以考虑这些不同因素及其对催化性能的影响。

[1] "High-valence dopants in an irreducible oxide have a different behavior than in a reducible one. To illustrate the difference, we contrast the effect of Ta dopant in ZrO2 and in CeO2."

[2] "If the HVD is a weak base, it will adsorb O2, but it will not neutralize completely its acidity. Therefore, O2 will react readily with bases such as CO, H, or CH3."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The influence of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of metal oxides varies depending on the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) and the strength of the dopant as a Lewis base.

For irreducible oxides:
- HVDs act as strong Lewis bases, increasing the difficulty of oxygen vacancy formation.
- Weak HVDs can adsorb O2 without fully neutralizing its acidity, allowing it to react with other bases like CO, H, or CH3.
- Strong HVDs may completely neutralize adsorbed O2, potentially turning the doped surface into a Lewis acid (e.g., NbO2 in NiO).

For reducible oxides:
- HVDs may donate electrons to reduce cations in the host oxide, potentially neutralizing their basicity.
- The behavior of HVDs in reducible oxides is more complex and less predictable.

Low-valence dopants (LVDs) generally act as Lewis acids in both reducible and irreducible oxides, lowering the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increasing the binding energy of bases to the surface.

Computational and experimental studies have provided insights into these behaviors, such as:
- The effect of Ti or Al doping in ZnO on O2 adsorption and activation.
- The contrasting effects of Ta doping in ZrO2 (irreducible) vs. CeO2 (reducible).
- The role of reducible oxides as Lewis acids in lowering vacancy formation energy and increasing metal atom binding.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:
1. The complex interplay between dopant properties, host oxide nature, and Lewis acid-base interactions.
2. The varying strength of Lewis acidity/basicity among dopants and host oxides.
3. The potential for dopants to change their behavior upon adsorption of species like O2.
4. The need to consider both electronic and structural effects of doping.

These factors make it difficult to establish universally applicable rules, necessitating careful consideration of each specific system and the use of advanced computational methods to predict dopant behavior accurately.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物催化性能的影响因主体氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）和掺杂剂作为路易斯碱的强度而异。

对于不可还原的氧化物：
- HVDs作为强路易斯碱，增加了氧空位形成的难度。
- 弱HVDs可以吸附O2而不完全中和其酸性，使其能与CO、H或CH3等其他碱反应。
- 强HVDs可能完全中和吸附的O2，potentially将掺杂表面转变为路易斯酸（例如NiO中的NbO2）。

对于可还原的氧化物：
- HVDs可能会捐赠电子以还原主体氧化物中的阳离子，可能会中和它们的碱性。
- HVDs在可还原氧化物中的行为更为复杂，难以预测。

低价掺杂剂（LVDs）在可还原和不可还原的氧化物中通常都表现为路易斯酸，降低氧空位形成能，增加碱性物质与表面的结合能。

计算和实验研究为这些行为提供了洞见，例如：
- Ti或Al掺杂对ZnO中O2吸附和活化的影响。
- Ta掺杂在ZrO2（不可还原）vs. CeO2（可还原）中的对比效应。
- 可还原氧化物作为路易斯酸在降低空位形成能和增加金属原子结合方面的作用。

制定掺杂剂行为通用预测规则的挑战包括：
1. 掺杂剂性质、主体氧化物性质和路易斯酸碱相互作用之间的复杂相互影响。
2. 掺杂剂和主体氧化物之间路易斯酸/碱强度的变化。
3. 掺杂剂在吸附O2等物质后可能改变其行为的潜力。
4. 需要同时考虑掺杂的电子和结构效应。

这些因素使得建立普遍适用的规则变得困难，需要仔细考虑每个特定系统，并使用先进的计算方法来准确预测掺杂剂的行为。

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) are not explicitly discussed in the given literature, but high-valence dopants (HVDs) and low-valence dopants (LVDs) are extensively covered.

HVDs influence metal oxides differently depending on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible. In irreducible oxides, HVDs act as Lewis bases, adsorbing Lewis acids like O2 or halogens. This can activate these adsorbed species for further reactions if the basicity of the dopant is not too strong. In reducible oxides, HVDs may donate electrons to reduce the host cations, altering the oxide's properties.

LVDs, on the other hand, turn the oxide surface into a Lewis acid. This lowers the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, increases binding energy of bases like H, CH3, and CO, and makes dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic.

Computational and experimental studies have revealed that the effects of dopants can be dramatic, sometimes changing reaction energies by several electron volts. These studies have also shown that the presence of gas-phase reactants can significantly alter the behavior of dopants, as seen with the formation of DO2 groups that can act differently from the original dopant D.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The complex interplay between the Lewis acid-base properties of the dopant, host oxide, and adsorbates.
2. The difference in behavior between reducible and irreducible oxides.
3. The potential for dopants to change their behavior in the presence of reactants or under reaction conditions.
4. The need to consider both electronic and structural effects of doping.

Despite these challenges, the Lewis acid-base framework presented in this literature provides a useful conceptual tool for understanding and predicting dopant behavior in metal oxides for catalytic applications.

虽然所给文献中没有明确讨论同价掺杂剂（SVDs），但对高价掺杂剂（HVDs）和低价掺杂剂（LVDs）进行了广泛的讨论。

HVDs对金属氧化物的影响取决于宿主氧化物是可还原的还是不可还原的。在不可还原的氧化物中，HVDs作为路易斯碱，吸附O2或卤素等路易斯酸。如果掺杂剂的碱性不是太强，这可以激活这些吸附物种进行进一步反应。在可还原的氧化物中，HVDs可能会捐赠电子以还原宿主阳离子，从而改变氧化物的性质。

另一方面，LVDs将氧化物表面转变为路易斯酸。这降低了形成氧空位所需的能量，增加了H、CH3和CO等碱的结合能，并使烷烃的解离吸附更加放热。

计算和实验研究表明，掺杂剂的影响可能是巨大的，有时会使反应能量改变几个电子伏特。这些研究还表明，气相反应物的存在可能会显著改变掺杂剂的行为，正如在形成DO2基团时所看到的，这些基团的行为可能与原始掺杂剂D不同。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的挑战包括：

1. 掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和吸附质之间路易斯酸碱性质的复杂相互作用。
2. 可还原和不可还原氧化物之间的行为差异。
3. 掺杂剂在反应物存在下或在反应条件下可能改变其行为的潜力。
4. 需要同时考虑掺杂的电子和结构效应。

尽管存在这些挑战，但本文献中提出的路易斯酸碱框架为理解和预测金属氧化物中掺杂剂在催化应用中的行为提供了有用的概念工具。

The influence of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of metal oxides varies depending on the nature of the host oxide and the specific dopant. 

For irreducible oxides, HVDs act as Lewis bases, increasing the electron density of the oxide surface. This can lead to stronger adsorption of Lewis acids like O2 or halogens, potentially activating these species for further reactions. However, the strength of this effect depends on the basicity of the dopant - if it's too strong, it may over-stabilize adsorbed species and reduce their reactivity.

In reducible oxides, the behavior of HVDs is more complex. They can interact with the reducible cations of the host oxide, potentially leading to charge transfer and changes in oxidation states. This can affect the oxide's redox properties and its ability to participate in catalytic cycles.

Low-valence dopants (LVDs) generally act as Lewis acids in both reducible and irreducible oxides. They tend to lower the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of basic species (like H, CH3, CO), and promote dissociative adsorption of alkanes. These effects can enhance the catalytic activity for certain reactions, particularly oxidation processes.

Computational studies have provided valuable insights into these behaviors, allowing researchers to predict and understand trends in dopant effects. However, challenges remain in formulating general predictive rules due to the complex interplay of factors such as:

1. The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)
2. The specific electronic properties of the dopant
3. The strength of Lewis acid-base interactions
4. Surface reconstruction and structural changes upon doping
5. The influence of reaction conditions on dopant behavior

To develop more comprehensive predictive rules, further studies are needed to systematically investigate a wider range of dopants, host oxides, and reaction conditions. This would help to better understand the nuances of dopant behavior and their effects on catalytic performance across different applications.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物催化性能的影响因主体氧化物的性质和特定掺杂剂而异。

对于不可还原的氧化物，HVDs作为路易斯碱，增加氧化物表面的电子密度。这可能导致对O2或卤素等路易斯酸的更强吸附，可能激活这些物种进行进一步反应。然而，这种效应的强度取决于掺杂剂的碱性 - 如果太强，可能会过度稳定吸附物种并降低其反应活性。

在可还原氧化物中，HVDs的行为更为复杂。它们可以与主体氧化物的可还原阳离子相互作用，可能导致电荷转移和氧化态的变化。这可能影响氧化物的氧化还原性质及其参与催化循环的能力。

低价掺杂剂（LVDs）在可还原和不可还原的氧化物中通常都表现为路易斯酸。它们倾向于降低形成氧空位所需的能量，增加碱性物种（如H、CH3、CO）的结合能，并促进烷烃的解离吸附。这些效应可以增强某些反应的催化活性，特别是氧化过程。

计算研究为这些行为提供了宝贵的见解，使研究人员能够预测和理解掺杂剂效应的趋势。然而，由于以下因素的复杂相互作用，制定通用预测规则仍然面临挑战：

1. 主体氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）
2. 掺杂剂的具体电子性质
3. 路易斯酸碱相互作用的强度
4. 掺杂后的表面重构和结构变化
5. 反应条件对掺杂剂行为的影响

为了制定更全面的预测规则，需要进一步研究系统地调查更广泛的掺杂剂、主体氧化物和反应条件。这将有助于更好地理解掺杂剂行为的细微差别及其对不同应用中催化性能的影响。

[1] "High-valence dopants in an irreducible oxide have a different behavior than in a reducible one. To illustrate the difference, we contrast the effect of Ta dopant in ZrO2 and in CeO2. In ceria, a Ta dopant donates an electron to the oxide to reduce a Ce4+ to Ce3+. Such reduction does not occur when Ta dopes ZrO2 since Zr2O3 does not exist, and there is no driving force to create Zr3+."

[2] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids.

[3] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms. The vacancy is a strong base, and the unpaired electrons produced when the oxygen atom is removed are transferred to the cations of the oxide."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs), high-valence dopants (HVDs), and low-valence dopants (LVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides in different ways, depending on the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible).

For reducible oxides like CeO2, HVDs like Ta can donate electrons to reduce the host cations (e.g., Ce4+ to Ce3+), affecting the oxide's redox properties. In irreducible oxides like ZrO2, this reduction doesn't occur, and the HVD acts as a strong Lewis base.

LVDs make the oxide surface more acidic, which lowers the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, increases binding of basic species, and promotes dissociative adsorption of alkanes. This can enhance catalytic activity for certain reactions.

HVDs generally act as Lewis bases, strongly adsorbing acidic species like O2 or halogens. If the HVD's basicity is moderate, the adsorbed species remain somewhat acidic and can still react with other bases, potentially activating them for catalysis.

Reducible oxides themselves act as Lewis acids, which affects their interaction with dopants and adsorbates. This acidity lowers oxygen vacancy formation energy and increases binding of single metal atoms, both of which can impact catalytic performance.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The complex interplay between dopant properties, host oxide nature (reducible vs. irreducible), and specific reaction conditions.
2. Varying strengths of Lewis acid-base interactions depending on the particular dopant-oxide-adsorbate system.
3. Potential structural changes or electronic reorganization upon doping or during reactions.
4. Differences in behavior between bulk and surface dopants.
5. The need to consider both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of catalytic processes.

Despite these challenges, computational studies have provided valuable insights into trends and mechanisms, allowing for more rational design of doped oxide catalysts. However, continued integration of theoretical predictions with experimental validation remains crucial for advancing the field.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)、高价掺杂剂(HVDs)和低价掺杂剂(LVDs)以不同方式影响金属氧化物的催化性质，这取决于宿主氧化物的性质(可还原vs.不可还原)。

对于可还原的氧化物如CeO2，HVDs如Ta可以捐赠电子以还原宿主阳离子(例如Ce4+到Ce3+)，影响氧化物的氧化还原性质。在不可还原的氧化物如ZrO2中，这种还原不会发生，HVD作为强Lewis碱。

LVDs使氧化物表面更具酸性，这降低了氧空位形成所需的能量，增加了碱性物种的结合，并促进烷烃的解离吸附。这可以增强某些反应的催化活性。

HVDs通常作为Lewis碱，强烈吸附酸性物种如O2或卤素。如果HVD的碱性适中，吸附的物种仍然保持一定的酸性，可以与其他碱反应，可能激活它们进行催化。

可还原氧化物本身作为Lewis酸，这影响它们与掺杂剂和吸附质的相互作用。这种酸性降低了氧空位形成能，增加了单个金属原子的结合，这两者都可能影响催化性能。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的挑战包括：

1. 掺杂剂性质、宿主氧化物性质(可还原vs.不可还原)和特定反应条件之间的复杂相互作用。
2. 根据特定的掺杂剂-氧化物-吸附质系统，Lewis酸碱相互作用强度的变化。
3. 掺杂或反应过程中可能发生的结构变化或电子重组。
4. 体相和表面掺杂剂行为的差异。
5. 需要同时考虑催化过程的热力学和动力学方面。

尽管存在这些挑战，计算研究为趋势和机理提供了宝贵的见解，允许更合理地设计掺杂氧化物催化剂。然而，继续将理论预测与实验验证相结合对推进该领域仍然至关重要。
