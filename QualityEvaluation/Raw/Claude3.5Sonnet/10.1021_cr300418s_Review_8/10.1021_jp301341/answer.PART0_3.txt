[1] "High-valence dopants in an irreducible oxide have a different behavior than in a reducible one. To illustrate the difference, we contrast the effect of Ta dopant in ZrO2 and in CeO2."

[2] "If the HVD is a weak base, it will adsorb O2, but it will not neutralize completely its acidity. Therefore, O2 will react readily with bases such as CO, H, or CH3."

[3] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic"

[4] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."

[5] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."

The influence of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of metal oxides varies depending on the nature of the host oxide and the specific dopant. 

For irreducible oxides, HVDs act as Lewis bases, increasing the electron density of the oxide surface. This can lead to stronger adsorption of Lewis acids like O2 or halogens, potentially activating these species for further reactions. However, the strength of this effect depends on the basicity of the dopant - if it's too strong, it may over-stabilize adsorbed species and reduce their reactivity.

In reducible oxides, the behavior of HVDs is more complex. They can interact with the reducible cations of the host oxide, potentially leading to charge transfer and changes in oxidation states. This can affect the oxide's redox properties and its ability to participate in catalytic cycles.

Low-valence dopants (LVDs) generally act as Lewis acids in both reducible and irreducible oxides. They tend to lower the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of basic species (like H, CH3, CO), and promote dissociative adsorption of alkanes. These effects can enhance the catalytic activity for certain reactions, particularly oxidation processes.

Computational studies have provided valuable insights into these behaviors, allowing researchers to predict and understand trends in dopant effects. However, challenges remain in formulating general predictive rules due to the complex interplay of factors such as:

1. The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)
2. The specific electronic properties of the dopant
3. The strength of Lewis acid-base interactions
4. Surface reconstruction and structural changes upon doping
5. The influence of reaction conditions on dopant behavior

To develop more comprehensive predictive rules, further studies are needed to systematically investigate a wider range of dopants, host oxides, and reaction conditions. This would help to better understand the nuances of dopant behavior and their effects on catalytic performance across different applications.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物催化性能的影响因主体氧化物的性质和特定掺杂剂而异。

对于不可还原的氧化物，HVDs作为路易斯碱，增加氧化物表面的电子密度。这可能导致对O2或卤素等路易斯酸的更强吸附，可能激活这些物种进行进一步反应。然而，这种效应的强度取决于掺杂剂的碱性 - 如果太强，可能会过度稳定吸附物种并降低其反应活性。

在可还原氧化物中，HVDs的行为更为复杂。它们可以与主体氧化物的可还原阳离子相互作用，可能导致电荷转移和氧化态的变化。这可能影响氧化物的氧化还原性质及其参与催化循环的能力。

低价掺杂剂（LVDs）在可还原和不可还原的氧化物中通常都表现为路易斯酸。它们倾向于降低形成氧空位所需的能量，增加碱性物种（如H、CH3、CO）的结合能，并促进烷烃的解离吸附。这些效应可以增强某些反应的催化活性，特别是氧化过程。

计算研究为这些行为提供了宝贵的见解，使研究人员能够预测和理解掺杂剂效应的趋势。然而，由于以下因素的复杂相互作用，制定通用预测规则仍然面临挑战：

1. 主体氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）
2. 掺杂剂的具体电子性质
3. 路易斯酸碱相互作用的强度
4. 掺杂后的表面重构和结构变化
5. 反应条件对掺杂剂行为的影响

为了制定更全面的预测规则，需要进一步研究系统地调查更广泛的掺杂剂、主体氧化物和反应条件。这将有助于更好地理解掺杂剂行为的细微差别及其对不同应用中催化性能的影响。
