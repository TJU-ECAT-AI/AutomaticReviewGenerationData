[1] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO. Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase the OVFE;"

[2] "The third class consists of all the dopants from group 3 to group 7 of the periodic table (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Re, La, and Ce). We place them in one class because they all increase substantially the OVFE. All these dopants can form oxides in which their oxidation state is greater than 2."

[3] "We were unsuccessful in our attempts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with other properties of the dopants like: the ionization energy, the electronegativity, the chemical hardness, and the covalent or the ionic radius. Although some of these properties may be used for rationalizing trends in OVFE for a limited set of dopants, none of them are applicable for all the dopants."

[4] "At present, density functional simulations have to be performed for each particular dopant-oxide pair to obtain the trends in OVFE in a reliable manner."

[5] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."

"All of these calculations show that the dopant affects favorably the properties of the host oxide."

"In all cases, doping with an SVD improves performance. However, we were unable to formulate any simple rules regarding the SVDs in catalysis other than to say that they should be tried, especially if one tunes the properties of an oxide that is already an efficient catalyst."

"The effect of high-valence dopants on the chemistry of the host oxide is more complex than that of LVDs because it depends on whether the host is reducible or not."

"If the host oxide is irreducible, this additional electron is localized on the dopant. (260, 272) This means that the dopant is a Lewis base, and this controls some of its chemistry."

"A high-valence dopant in a reducible oxide (e.g., Ta dopant in CeO2) behaves differently. (258) Because Ce4+ cations are easily reduced to Ce3+ (Ce4+ is a Lewis acid), an HVD can donate its excess electrons to reduce Ce ions in the host oxide."

"Pala et al. (271) examined the effect of all substitutional dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the surface of ZnO. They showed that all HVDs increased the energy needed for removing a surface oxygen atom located near the dopant. This suggests that the HVDs can be used to hinder oxidation by the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."

"The examples presented here suggest that it may be difficult to find simple rules for the effects of flexible-valence dopants, especially if the host oxide is a reducible. More computational and experimental work is needed for clarifying the behavior of these systems."

[1] "We found that the low-valence dopants (LVDs) lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation near them or far from them. This is true when they dope a reducible (CeO2) or an irreducible (MgO) oxide."

[2] "In irreducible oxides, high-valence dopants seem to always increase the energy of vacancy formation. This increase is small in very stable oxides (MgO and La2O3) and substantial in less-stable oxide (e.g., ZnO)."

[3] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopant–oxygen bonds that are much shorter than the Ce–O bonds in ceria."

[4] "The effect of substitutional doping of ceria on the chemistry of the surface has been studied previously, by density functional theory, for the following dopants: Pd, (6-8) Al, (9) Sc, (9) Y, (9) Ta, (10) Nb, (10) La, (11, 12) Zr, (8, 13, 14) Ir, (15) Cu, (16) Ni, (17) Au, (18-20) Ti, (14) Hf, (14) and Pt. (21)"

[5] "An examination of the projected density of states (PDOS) shows that W and Mo donate two electrons to ceria to reduce two Ce atoms, and Ta and Nb donate one electron to reduce one Ce atom. After this electron donation, these dopants have only four electrons available for making bonds, just like the Ce atom they replace."

[1] "We use theory to identify energetically favored reaction pathways. We calculate the activation energy only for the most important steps: the reaction of CO with the adsorbed O2 molecule and the formation of an oxygen vacancy by transfer of an oxygen atom from the surface onto the dopant."

[2] "In previous calculations [50], we have found that doping ZnO with Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, or W increases substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the oxide; Al, Mg, Ca, La, Re, Os and Ce have a similar, but less pronounced, effect."

[3] "The fact that the oxygen atoms near the dopant bind more strongly to the oxide indicates that the dopant is undercoordinated. This would imply that such a dopant will adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy its need for a higher coordination."

[4] "We propose and demonstrate two CO oxidation pathways that are different from the traditional MVK mechanism. We have shown that cationic substitutional doping of ZnO with Ti or Al promotes adsorption of O2 on the dopant. Essentially, this happens because Ti and Al have a higher valence than Zn."

[5] "We speculate that numerous other oxides doped with cations having a higher valence than the host will behave like the present system in oxidation reactions, especially if the cation in the host is not able to reduce its valence when the dopant is present."

[1] "There are indications, from theory and experiment, that substitutionally doped oxides might be a class of interesting partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts."

[2] "More important to us are papers that set out to prepare doped oxides to use as catalysts or to make the host oxide a better oxidant."

[3] "Most among these papers found that doping lowers the temperature at which the oxide is reduced by CO or H2. Those who studied a catalytic reaction found that doping improves the catalytic activity of the host oxide."

[4] "Doping is not always beneficial. Ceria doped with Sm, Gd, La, Nb, and Ta has lower activity toward n-butane oxidation than ceria alone, and doping ceria with La, Pr, Gd, or Nb slows down CO oxidation."

[5] "Our premise was that in many systems the presence of a well-chosen dopant weakens the bond of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increases their chemical activity. Therefore, such a doped oxide is a better oxidant than the undoped one, and it is more likely to engage in an oxidation reaction by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism"

[6] "In previous work we have found that doping ZnO with metal atoms having a higher valence than Zn will increase the energy of vacancy formation. Surprisingly, this is not the case for the systems studied here. Doping TiO2 (110) with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of vacancy formation, and doping with W leaves it practically unchanged."

[7] "The doped oxides studied here are better oxidants than rutile TiO2 (110)."

[8] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

[9] "Doping rutile TiO2 (110) with Ru, Sn, Mn, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, or Au substantially lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, whereas doping with Zr and Hf causes practically no change. Doping CeO2 (111) with Au, Cu, and Ag also lowers the energy of vacancy formation. However, this effect is not universal; (56) doping ZnO (1010) with Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, or Ta very substantially increases the energy of vacancy formation."

[10] "If we speculate that this relationship holds for the systems studied here, then we can make some guesses regarding the activity of these doped oxides. Table 4 shows that the energy of CO2 desorption, by carbonate decomposition, and the energy of the reaction of CO with the adsorbed oxygen do not change when we change the catalyst; these reactions will not differentiate between catalysts. The catalysts will differ through their ability to adsorb CO on the surface and their ability to adsorb O2 at an oxygen vacancy site."

[1] "We present density functional theory (DFT) studies of doping of the CeO2 (1 1 0) surface with +5 cations, Ta and Nb, as a route to formation of Ce3+."

[2] "With both methods we find formation of Ce3+ ions due to the extra electron from the dopant residing on a single Ce site, confirming the DFT + U description of these systems."

[3] "Doping with Nb and Ta activates the surface to NO2 reduction  there is no interaction with the undoped surface but the Ce3+ ion in the doped surface interacts strongly with NO2."

[4] "We are interested in systems in which Ce3+ can be produced by doping, as an alternative to oxygen vacancy formation."

[5] "Thus the vital factor in the reduction of NO2 is the presence of Ce3+ ions at the oxide surface and the ease with which such ions can be reoxidised through charge transfer to an adsorbate."

[6] "Substitutional cation doping of ceria with another species, such as Zr [1012], Ti [10], Au [6] and Cu [13], has been shown to reduce the energy required for formation of oxygen vacancies."

[7] "Doping of ceria with high oxidation state cations is a novel and potentially more controlled means of generating Ce3+ ions that are active for molecular reduction, as compared to oxygen vacancy formation."

[8] "Given the problems with using density functional theory (DFT) to study ceria, we apply two DFT approaches: DFT corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, DFT + U [18] and hybrid DFT, in the shape of the HSE06 functional [19]."

[1] "We have found that all of these dopants lower substantially the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, as suggested by the propensity rule mentioned above."

[2] "We also found that there is an approximate linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant."

[3] "If the oxidation reaction uses oxygen from the surface, the oxidation creates oxygen vacancies on the surface. However, because oxygen is present in the gas, the vacancies will be filled by a competing process."

[4] "It is often suggested that, because oxygen vacancies are chemically active, they must play an important role in catalysis. This is not necessarily the case."

[5] "We proposed a possible explanation. We note that it is possible that many of the catalysts studied experimentally may be inadvertently doped."

[6] "By examining the results of prior calculations, (2, 4, 22, 28, 43, 48) we have formulated the following propensity rules: (1) To decrease the oxygen-vacancy formation energy, the valence of the dopant should be lower than or equal to that of the cation it is replacing (La in the present case). (2) The oxide of the dopant should be less stable (as judged by the enthalpy or the Gibbs free energy of formation) than the oxide being doped."

[7] "It is difficult to measure reliably the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the top layer of an oxide surface. Nevertheless, it appears that most DFT calculations find that the energy for forming oxygen vacancies is surprisingly high when compared with experiments. It is conceivable that this reflects errors in DFT, but we do not believe that the errors could be so large."

[8] "If the bonds in the system are purely ionic, the dopant with a lower valence will have a lower formal charge and this will affect its ability to bind the oxygen. If the dopantoxygen bond is purely covalent, the lower valence makes the dopant unable to bind all the oxygen atoms that La can bind, and this too will lead to a weakening of the bond of at least one oxygen atom to the surface."

[9] "It is unlikely that the effect of all of these factors can be captured by a linear relationship between the energy of vacancy formation in the doped oxide and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant. Further calculations are needed to determine how general this linear relationship is."

[1] "Significantly, its redox performance can be further enhanced by the presence of various dopants, such as Zr4+, Ca2+ and some noble metal [36]."

[2] "Zr-dopants further weaken the CeO bonds in the substrate and therefore facilitate direct formation of CO + OL  CO2,gas."

[3] "Zr is irreducible and thus may substantially change the local chemistry."

[4] "Apparently, Zr dopants strongly change the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation on the ceria (111) surface."

[5] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."

[6] "Zr dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and hence weaken the CeO bonds, which benefit the direct oxidation of CO on Zr-doped ceria."

[7] "Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."

[1] "High-valence dopants in an irreducible oxide have a different behavior than in a reducible one. To illustrate the difference, we contrast the effect of Ta dopant in ZrO2 and in CeO2."

[2] "If CeO2 is doped with Nb or Ta, these pentavalent dopants lose an electron, which fills an f-orbital localized on a Ce ion. The formal valence of this Ce ion is 3+."

[3] "When it replaces a Zr atom in ZrO2, a Ta atom can use only four of its five valence electrons. The unused electron stays on the Ta dopant, turning it into a strong Lewis base."

[4] "To explore this question, it is simplest to consider that O2 adsorption changed the dopant from D to DO2. Since the oxygen uses some of the extra electrons in D, DO2 has fewer electrons to affect the host oxide than D."

[5] "Calculations show that indeed it does. In Figure 3 we show the NiO(011) surface doped with NbO2. We marked two of the oxygen atoms as A and B. Making an oxygen vacancy by removing the atom A requires 2.31 eV, and making a vacancy by removing B costs 2.67 eV. This is substantially lower than the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy on the undoped surface, which is 3.28 eV."

[6] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."

[7] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic"

[8] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."

[1] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."

[2] "Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown). We obtained very similar results forAuxCe1xO2 [27]. Moreover, doping TiO2 with Pt, Pd, Cu, Ni and Ag weakens the bond of the surface oxygen to the oxide even more than doping with Au (see table 1)."

[3] "A good oxidation catalyst in this class of compounds requires a fine balance between the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation."

[4] "It may seem strange that Cu or Ni are capable of weakening the bond of the surface oxygen to the oxide, more than Au, even though the Cu and Ni oxides are more stable than those of Au (Cu and Ni have higher affinity for oxygen than Au). This happens for several reasons. First, Cu and Ni are not capable of making compounds with the formal charge of 4+ and the oxygen surrounding them (when they are dopants) see an electron deficit, which weakens their ability to bond."

[5] "Given the complexity of these systems the experimental observations are not absolutely conclusive, even though taken together they provide strong circumstantial evidence. It is therefore useful to use theory to examine the possibility that doped oxides are good oxidation catalysts and to understand the mechanism through which such catalysis proceeds."

[6] "We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts. We studied in detail titania doped with Au and used CO oxidation as a test of the oxidizing power of the system."

[7] "It is well known that density functional theory does not describe correctly the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth oxides. Theory predicts that these compounds are metals, while experiments show them to be antiferromagnetic Mott insulators."

[1] "Doping of ceria with other metallic elements, such as Zr, has been shown to enhance thermal stability (9, 10) and to promote catalytic activity. (9-17) It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria, (6, 9-18) by weakening the bonds to the oxide of the oxygen atoms around the dopant."

[2] "A number of computational studies have demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is lower when the surface is doped with Zr, (9, 10, 17) Pt, (19) Pd, (20) and Au, (6, 18) among others."

[3] "We used density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) to study the effect of doping the (110) surface of ceria with Ti, Zr, and Hf on CO adsorption and NO reduction, as well as the energetics of CO oxidation to CO2 and NO reduction to N2."

[4] "These dopants have formal 4+ oxidation states, which means that there are no issues with charge compensation or oxygen hole formation processes."

[5] "Consistent with the substantial reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy, the energy gain upon adsorption of CO is notably larger on the doped surfaces."

[6] "Thus, the correlation between oxygen vacancy formation and surface reduction and reoxidation is clear: enhancing oxygen vacancy formation will enhance the interaction of CO with a doped ceria surface, but the tradeoff will be that the interaction of NOx with the doped surface will not be as favorable."

[1] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO. Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase the OVFE;"

[2] "The third class consists of all the dopants from group 3 to group 7 of the periodic table (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Re, La, and Ce). We place them in one class because they all increase substantially the OVFE. All these dopants can form oxides in which their oxidation state is greater than 2."

[3] "We were unsuccessful in our attempts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with other properties of the dopants like: the ionization energy, the electronegativity, the chemical hardness, and the covalent or the ionic radius.

[4] "At present, density functional simulations have to be performed for each particular dopant-oxide pair to obtain the trends in OVFE in a reliable manner."

[5] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."

[5] "Calculations show that indeed it does. In Figure 3 we show the NiO(011) surface doped with NbO2. We marked two of the oxygen atoms as A and B. Making an oxygen vacancy by removing the atom A requires 2.31 eV, and making a vacancy by removing B costs 2.67 eV. This is substantially lower than the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy on the undoped surface, which is 3.28 eV."

[6] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."

[7] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic"

[8] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."

[1] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."

[2] "Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown). We obtained very similar results forAuxCe1xO2 [27]. Moreover, doping TiO2 with Pt, Pd, Cu, Ni and Ag weakens the bond of the surface oxygen to the oxide even more than doping with Au (see table 1)."

[3] "A good oxidation catalyst in this class of compounds requires a fine balance between the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation."

[4] "It may seem strange that Cu or Ni are capable of weakening the bond of the surface oxygen to the oxide, more than Au, even though the Cu and Ni oxides are more stable than those of Au (Cu and Ni have higher affinity for oxygen than Au). This happens for several reasons. First, Cu and Ni are not capable of making compounds with the formal charge of 4+ and the oxygen surrounding them (when they are dopants) see an electron deficit, which weakens their ability to bond."

[5] "Given the complexity of these systems the experimental observations are not absolutely conclusive, even though taken together they provide strong circumstantial evidence. It is therefore useful to use theory to examine the possibility that doped oxides are good oxidation catalysts and to understand the mechanism through which such catalysis proceeds."

[6] "We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts. We studied in detail titania doped with Au and used CO oxidation as a test of the oxidizing power of the system."

[7] "It is well known that density functional theory does not describe correctly the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth oxides. Theory predicts that these compounds are metals, while experiments show them to be antiferromagnetic Mott insulators."

[1] "Doping of ceria with other metallic elements, such as Zr, has been shown to enhance thermal stability (9, 10) and to promote catalytic activity. (9-17) It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria, (6, 9-18) by weakening the bonds to the oxide of the oxygen atoms around the dopant."

[2] "A number of computational studies have demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is lower when the surface is doped with Zr, (9, 10, 17) Pt, (19) Pd, (20) and Au, (6, 18) among others."

[3] "We used density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) to study the effect of doping the (110) surface of ceria with Ti, Zr, and Hf on CO adsorption and NO reduction, as well as the energetics of CO oxidation to CO2 and NO reduction to N2."

[4] "These dopants have formal 4+ oxidation states, which means that there are no issues with charge compensation or oxygen hole formation processes."

[5] "Consistent with the substantial reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy, the energy gain upon adsorption of CO is notably larger on the doped surfaces."

[6] "Thus, the correlation between oxygen vacancy formation and surface reduction and reoxidation is clear: enhancing oxygen vacancy formation will enhance the interaction of CO with a doped ceria surface, but the tradeoff will be that the interaction of NOx with the doped surface will not be as favorable."
