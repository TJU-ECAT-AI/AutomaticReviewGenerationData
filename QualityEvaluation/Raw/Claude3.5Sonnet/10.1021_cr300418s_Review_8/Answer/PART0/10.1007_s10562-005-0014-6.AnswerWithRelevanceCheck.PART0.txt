          [1] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."

[2] "Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown). We obtained very similar results forAuxCe1xO2 [27]. Moreover, doping TiO2 with Pt, Pd, Cu, Ni and Ag weakens the bond of the surface oxygen to the oxide even more than doping with Au (see table 1)."

[3] "A good oxidation catalyst in this class of compounds requires a fine balance between the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation."

[4] "It may seem strange that Cu or Ni are capable of weakening the bond of the surface oxygen to the oxide, more than Au, even though the Cu and Ni oxides are more stable than those of Au (Cu and Ni have higher affinity for oxygen than Au). This happens for several reasons. First, Cu and Ni are not capable of making compounds with the formal charge of 4+ and the oxygen surrounding them (when they are dopants) see an electron deficit, which weakens their ability to bond."

[5] "Given the complexity of these systems the experimental observations are not absolutely conclusive, even though taken together they provide strong circumstantial evidence. It is therefore useful to use theory to examine the possibility that doped oxides are good oxidation catalysts and to understand the mechanism through which such catalysis proceeds."

[6] "We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts. We studied in detail titania doped with Au and used CO oxidation as a test of the oxidizing power of the system."

[7] "It is well known that density functional theory does not describe correctly the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth oxides. Theory predicts that these compounds are metals, while experiments show them to be antiferromagnetic Mott insulators."

          The literature provides insights into how various metal dopants influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly TiO2 and CeO2, although it does not explicitly differentiate between same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs).

Key findings from computational and experimental studies include:

1. Doping TiO2 and CeO2 with metals like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni significantly weakens the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, enhancing their performance as oxidation catalysts.

2. Some dopants (e.g., Cu and Ni) can weaken the surface oxygen bond more effectively than Au, despite forming more stable oxides. This is attributed to their inability to form compounds with a 4+ formal charge, creating an electron deficit around the dopant site.

3. An effective oxidation catalyst requires a balance between the ability to donate oxygen during oxidation and the ability to replenish oxygen from the gas phase to fill vacancies.

4. Density Functional Theory (DFT) was used to study these systems, with CO oxidation as a test reaction. However, limitations in DFT's accuracy for describing the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth oxides are acknowledged.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The complex interplay of factors influencing catalytic performance, such as dopant nature, charge state, host oxide properties, and reaction conditions.

2. The need to balance oxygen donation and vacancy healing capabilities, which can vary depending on the specific dopant-oxide combination.

3. The limitations of current computational methods in accurately describing the electronic structures of these complex systems.

While the study doesn't explicitly address Lewis acid-base interactions or compare reducible and irreducible oxides, it implies that the electronic properties of the dopant-oxide system, including charge transfer and electron localization, play a crucial role in determining catalytic behavior.

          这项文献研究提供了关于各种金属掺杂剂如何影响金属氧化物（特别是TiO2和CeO2）催化性能的见解，但并未明确区分同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)。

计算和实验研究的主要发现包括：

1. 用Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni等金属掺杂TiO2和CeO2显著削弱了表面氧与氧化物之间的键合，提高了它们作为氧化催化剂的性能。

2. 一些掺杂剂（如Cu和Ni）能比Au更有效地削弱表面氧键，尽管它们形成更稳定的氧化物。这被归因于它们无法形成具有4+形式电荷的化合物，在掺杂剂位置周围产生电子亏损。

3. 有效的氧化催化剂需要在氧化过程中提供氧的能力和从气相中补充氧以填补空位的能力之间取得平衡。

4. 研究使用密度泛函理论（DFT）来研究这些系统，以CO氧化作为测试反应。然而，研究也承认DFT在描述过渡金属和稀土氧化物的电子结构方面存在局限性。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的挑战包括：

1. 影响催化性能的因素之间复杂的相互作用，如掺杂剂的性质、电荷状态、宿主氧化物的特性以及反应条件。

2. 需要平衡氧供给和空位愈合能力，这些能力可能因特定的掺杂剂-氧化物组合而异。

3. 当前计算方法在准确描述这些复杂系统的电子结构方面的局限性。

虽然研究没有明确讨论Lewis酸碱相互作用或比较可还原和不可还原的氧化物，但它暗示掺杂剂-氧化物系统的电子性质，包括电荷转移和电子局域化，在决定催化行为方面起着关键作用。
