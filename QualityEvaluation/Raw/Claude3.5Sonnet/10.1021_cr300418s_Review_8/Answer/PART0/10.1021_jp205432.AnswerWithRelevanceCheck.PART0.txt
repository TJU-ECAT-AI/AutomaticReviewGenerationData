          [1] "We found that the low-valence dopants (LVDs) lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation near them or far from them. This is true when they dope a reducible (CeO2) or an irreducible (MgO) oxide."

[2] "In irreducible oxides, high-valence dopants seem to always increase the energy of vacancy formation. This increase is small in very stable oxides (MgO and La2O3) and substantial in less-stable oxide (e.g., ZnO)."

[3] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopant–oxygen bonds that are much shorter than the Ce–O bonds in ceria."

[4] "The effect of substitutional doping of ceria on the chemistry of the surface has been studied previously, by density functional theory, for the following dopants: Pd, (6-8) Al, (9) Sc, (9) Y, (9) Ta, (10) Nb, (10) La, (11, 12) Zr, (8, 13, 14) Ir, (15) Cu, (16) Ni, (17) Au, (18-20) Ti, (14) Hf, (14) and Pt. (21)"

[5] "An examination of the projected density of states (PDOS) shows that W and Mo donate two electrons to ceria to reduce two Ce atoms, and Ta and Nb donate one electron to reduce one Ce atom. After this electron donation, these dopants have only four electrons available for making bonds, just like the Ce atom they replace."

          Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides differently depending on the nature of the host oxide:

1. In irreducible oxides (e.g., MgO):
   - Low-valence dopants (LVDs) lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation both near and far from the dopant site.
   - High-valence dopants (HVDs) generally increase the energy of vacancy formation, with the effect being more pronounced in less stable oxides.

2. In reducible oxides (e.g., CeO2):
   - LVDs also lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation both near and far from the dopant site.
   - The behavior of HVDs is more complex and less predictable. Dopants like Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, and W all lower the energy of vacancy formation by similar amounts, despite having different valences and chemical properties.

Computational studies, particularly density functional theory calculations, have provided insights into the effects of various dopants on the surface chemistry of ceria. These studies have covered a wide range of dopants, including Pd, Al, Sc, Y, Ta, Nb, La, Zr, Ir, Cu, Ni, Au, Ti, Hf, and Pt.

Mechanisms behind dopant effects:
1. Electronic effects: Some HVDs (e.g., W, Mo, Ta, Nb) donate electrons to reduce Ce atoms in ceria, effectively becoming tetravalent like the Ce they replace.
2. Structural effects: Many dopants in CeO2 form shorter bonds with oxygen than Ce does, pulling oxygen atoms away from Ce and weakening their bond to the surface.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:
1. The complex interplay between electronic effects and structural changes induced by dopants.
2. The different behaviors observed in reducible vs. irreducible oxides.
3. The unexpected similarities in effects between dopants with very different chemical properties.
4. The need to consider both local and long-range effects of dopants.

These findings highlight the importance of considering the specific host oxide and dopant combination when predicting catalytic behavior, rather than relying solely on general rules based on valence or chemical properties.

          同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物的催化性能的影响方式不同，这取决于宿主氧化物的性质：

1. 在不可还原的氧化物（如MgO）中：
   - 低价掺杂剂（LVDs）降低了氧空位形成的能量，无论是在掺杂剂附近还是远离掺杂剂的位置。
   - 高价掺杂剂（HVDs）通常增加空位形成的能量，这种效应在较不稳定的氧化物中更为明显。

2. 在可还原的氧化物（如CeO2）中：
   - LVDs也降低了氧空位形成的能量，无论是在掺杂剂附近还是远离掺杂剂的位置。
   - HVDs的行为更为复杂和难以预测。例如，Pt、Ru、Zr、Ta、Nb、Mo和W等掺杂剂都以相似的程度降低了空位形成的能量，尽管它们具有不同的价态和化学性质。

计算研究，特别是密度泛函理论计算，为了解各种掺杂剂对氧化铈表面化学的影响提供了洞见。这些研究涵盖了广泛的掺杂剂，包括Pd、Al、Sc、Y、Ta、Nb、La、Zr、Ir、Cu、Ni、Au、Ti、Hf和Pt。

掺杂剂效应的机制：
1. 电子效应：一些HVDs（如W、Mo、Ta、Nb）向CeO2捐赠电子以还原Ce原子，实际上变成与它们替代的Ce相同的四价态。
2. 结构效应：许多掺杂剂在CeO2中与氧形成比Ce更短的键，将氧原子拉离Ce并削弱它们与表面的键合。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的挑战包括：
1. 电子效应与掺杂剂引起的结构变化之间的复杂相互作用。
2. 在可还原和不可还原氧化物中观察到的不同行为。
3. 化学性质非常不同的掺杂剂之间效应的意外相似性。
4. 需要考虑掺杂剂的局部和长程效应。

这些发现强调了在预测催化行为时考虑特定宿主氧化物和掺杂剂组合的重要性，而不是仅仅依赖基于价态或化学性质的一般规则。
