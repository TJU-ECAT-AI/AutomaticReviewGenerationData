          [1] "There are indications, from theory and experiment, that substitutionally doped oxides might be a class of interesting partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts."

[2] "More important to us are papers that set out to prepare doped oxides to use as catalysts or to make the host oxide a better oxidant."

[3] "Most among these papers found that doping lowers the temperature at which the oxide is reduced by CO or H2. Those who studied a catalytic reaction found that doping improves the catalytic activity of the host oxide."

[4] "Doping is not always beneficial. Ceria doped with Sm, Gd, La, Nb, and Ta has lower activity toward n-butane oxidation than ceria alone, and doping ceria with La, Pr, Gd, or Nb slows down CO oxidation."

[5] "Our premise was that in many systems the presence of a well-chosen dopant weakens the bond of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increases their chemical activity. Therefore, such a doped oxide is a better oxidant than the undoped one, and it is more likely to engage in an oxidation reaction by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism"

[6] "In previous work we have found that doping ZnO with metal atoms having a higher valence than Zn will increase the energy of vacancy formation. Surprisingly, this is not the case for the systems studied here. Doping TiO2 (110) with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of vacancy formation, and doping with W leaves it practically unchanged."

[7] "The doped oxides studied here are better oxidants than rutile TiO2 (110)."

[8] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

[9] "Doping rutile TiO2 (110) with Ru, Sn, Mn, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, or Au substantially lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, whereas doping with Zr and Hf causes practically no change. Doping CeO2 (111) with Au, Cu, and Ag also lowers the energy of vacancy formation. However, this effect is not universal; (56) doping ZnO (1010) with Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, or Ta very substantially increases the energy of vacancy formation."

[10] "If we speculate that this relationship holds for the systems studied here, then we can make some guesses regarding the activity of these doped oxides. Table 4 shows that the energy of CO2 desorption, by carbonate decomposition, and the energy of the reaction of CO with the adsorbed oxygen do not change when we change the catalyst; these reactions will not differentiate between catalysts. The catalysts will differ through their ability to adsorb CO on the surface and their ability to adsorb O2 at an oxygen vacancy site."

          The influence of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of metal oxides varies depending on the specific oxide and dopant combination:

1. Generally, doping can improve catalytic activity for partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Many studies show that doping lowers the reduction temperature of oxides by CO or H2 and enhances catalytic activity.

2. For TiO2, both SVDs (Mn, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au) and HVDs (V, Cr, Mo, W) typically lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, making doped oxides better oxidants than undoped TiO2. This effect is more pronounced when HVDs like V, Cr, W, or Mo form a MO group.

3. Doping CeO2 with Au, Cu, and Ag (SVDs) also lowers vacancy formation energy. However, doping ceria with certain elements (Sm, Gd, La, Nb, Ta) decreases its activity for n-butane oxidation and CO oxidation.

4. ZnO shows opposite behavior: HVDs (Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta) substantially increase vacancy formation energy, potentially making the doped oxide a poorer oxidant.

5. The catalytic performance in CO oxidation is primarily differentiated by two factors: CO adsorption on the surface and O2 adsorption at oxygen vacancy sites. Both factors are related to vacancy formation energy, which serves as a useful descriptor for predicting catalytic activity.

These findings highlight that dopant effects depend on the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) and specific dopant-oxide interactions. Well-chosen dopants can weaken the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface, increasing chemical activity and promoting oxidation reactions via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

Computational and experimental studies have provided valuable insights into these mechanisms, but challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules due to the complex interplay of factors involved.

          同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物催化性能的影响因特定的氧化物和掺杂剂组合而异：

1. 通常，掺杂可以提高部分氧化和氧化脱氢反应的催化活性。许多研究表明，掺杂降低了氧化物被CO或H2还原的温度，并提高了催化活性。

2. 对于TiO2，SVDs（Mn、Ni、Pd、Pt、Cu、Ag、Au）和HVDs（V、Cr、Mo、W）通常都会降低氧空位形成能，使掺杂氧化物成为比未掺杂TiO2更好的氧化剂。当HVDs如V、Cr、W或Mo形成MO基团时，这种效果更加显著。

3. 用Au、Cu和Ag（SVDs）掺杂CeO2也会降低空位形成能。然而，用某些元素（Sm、Gd、La、Nb、Ta）掺杂氧化铈会降低其对正丁烷氧化和CO氧化的活性。

4. ZnO表现出相反的行为：HVDs（Sc、Y、La、Ti、Zr、Hf、Ce、V、Nb、Ta）大幅增加空位形成能，可能使掺杂氧化物成为较差的氧化剂。

5. CO氧化的催化性能主要由两个因素区分：CO在表面的吸附和O2在氧空位处的吸附。这两个因素都与空位形成能有关，空位形成能可作为预测催化活性的有用描述符。

这些发现强调了掺杂剂效应取决于宿主氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）和特定的掺杂剂-氧化物相互作用。精心选择的掺杂剂可以削弱相邻氧原子与表面之间的键合，增加化学活性，通过Mars-van Krevelen机制促进氧化反应。

计算和实验研究为这些机制提供了宝贵的见解，但由于涉及因素的复杂相互作用，制定通用预测规则仍然面临挑战。
