          [1] "We have found that all of these dopants lower substantially the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, as suggested by the propensity rule mentioned above."

[2] "We also found that there is an approximate linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant."

[3] "If the oxidation reaction uses oxygen from the surface, the oxidation creates oxygen vacancies on the surface. However, because oxygen is present in the gas, the vacancies will be filled by a competing process."

[4] "It is often suggested that, because oxygen vacancies are chemically active, they must play an important role in catalysis. This is not necessarily the case."

[5] "We proposed a possible explanation. We note that it is possible that many of the catalysts studied experimentally may be inadvertently doped."

[6] "By examining the results of prior calculations, (2, 4, 22, 28, 43, 48) we have formulated the following propensity rules: (1) To decrease the oxygen-vacancy formation energy, the valence of the dopant should be lower than or equal to that of the cation it is replacing (La in the present case). (2) The oxide of the dopant should be less stable (as judged by the enthalpy or the Gibbs free energy of formation) than the oxide being doped."

[7] "It is difficult to measure reliably the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the top layer of an oxide surface. Nevertheless, it appears that most DFT calculations find that the energy for forming oxygen vacancies is surprisingly high when compared with experiments. It is conceivable that this reflects errors in DFT, but we do not believe that the errors could be so large."

[8] "If the bonds in the system are purely ionic, the dopant with a lower valence will have a lower formal charge and this will affect its ability to bind the oxygen. If the dopantoxygen bond is purely covalent, the lower valence makes the dopant unable to bind all the oxygen atoms that La can bind, and this too will lead to a weakening of the bond of at least one oxygen atom to the surface."

[9] "It is unlikely that the effect of all of these factors can be captured by a linear relationship between the energy of vacancy formation in the doped oxide and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant. Further calculations are needed to determine how general this linear relationship is."

          Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides primarily by affecting the energy of oxygen vacancy formation. Both computational and experimental studies have shown that dopants can substantially lower this energy, which is crucial for catalytic activity in many applications.

Key findings from the research include:

1. Dopants with valence lower than or equal to the host cation tend to decrease the oxygen vacancy formation energy, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

2. An approximate linear relationship exists between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the dopant's oxide. This provides a useful predictive tool for estimating dopant effects, although its generality requires further investigation.

3. The effect of oxygen vacancies on catalysis is complex and context-dependent. While vacancies are often thought to be important for catalysis, this is not always the case.

4. The concentration of oxygen vacancies in catalytic applications is determined by a competition between reduction and oxidation processes. This can be manipulated by introducing controlled amounts of strong reductants like CO.

5. Unintentional doping in experimental catalysts may explain discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results for oxygen vacancy formation energies.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to multiple factors:

1. The difference in valence between the dopant and the host cation affects bonding.
2. The distance between the dopant and oxygen atoms in the doped oxide vs. the dopant's own oxide influences bond strength.
3. Structural differences between the host oxide and the dopant's oxide affect oxygen binding.
4. The nature of the bonds (ionic vs. covalent) in the system affects the dopant's ability to bind oxygen.

The study emphasizes the need for further calculations to determine the generality of the observed relationships and to develop more comprehensive predictive rules for dopant behavior across different metal oxides and catalytic applications.

While the research provides valuable insights, it does not directly address Lewis acid-base interactions or compare reducible vs. irreducible oxides, indicating that these remain areas for further investigation in understanding dopant effects on catalytic properties.

          同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)主要通过影响氧空位形成能来影响金属氧化物的催化性能。计算和实验研究都表明，掺杂剂可以显著降低这种能量，这对许多应用中的催化活性至关重要。

研究的主要发现包括：

1. 价态低于或等于主体阳离子的掺杂剂倾向于降低氧空位形成能，可能增强催化活性。

2. 氧空位形成能与掺杂剂氧化物的生成焓之间存在近似线性关系。这为估计掺杂剂效果提供了有用的预测工具，尽管其普适性还需要进一步研究。

3. 氧空位对催化作用的影响是复杂的，且依赖于具体情况。虽然空位常被认为对催化很重要，但并非总是如此。

4. 在催化应用中，氧空位的浓度由还原和氧化过程的竞争决定。这可以通过引入受控量的强还原剂（如CO）来操纵。

5. 实验催化剂中的无意掺杂可能解释了氧空位形成能理论预测与实验结果之间的差异。

制定掺杂剂行为的通用预测规则仍面临挑战，原因如下：

1. 掺杂剂与宿主阳离子之间的价态差异影响成键。
2. 掺杂氧化物中掺杂剂与氧原子之间的距离与掺杂剂自身氧化物中的距离不同，影响键强度。
3. 宿主氧化物与掺杂剂氧化物之间的结构差异影响氧结合。
4. 系统中键的性质（离子键vs.共价键）影响掺杂剂结合氧的能力。

研究强调需要进行进一步计算，以确定观察到的关系的普遍性，并为不同金属氧化物和催化应用中的掺杂剂行为制定更全面的预测规则。

虽然该研究提供了宝贵的见解，但没有直接涉及路易斯酸碱相互作用，也没有比较可还原与不可还原的氧化物，这表明在理解掺杂剂对催化性能的影响方面，这些仍然是需要进一步研究的领域。
