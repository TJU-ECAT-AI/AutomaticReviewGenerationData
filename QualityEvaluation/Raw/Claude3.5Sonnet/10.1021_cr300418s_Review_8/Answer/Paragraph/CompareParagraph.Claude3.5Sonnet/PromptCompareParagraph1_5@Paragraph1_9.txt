The complex effects of dopants on the catalytic properties of metal oxides: A comprehensive analysis of same-valence and high-valence dopants in various host systems

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) significantly influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, with their effects varying depending on the nature of the host oxide and the specific dopant-oxide combination. This review synthesizes findings from computational and experimental studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of dopant effects on catalytic performance.

1. Effects on Oxygen Vacancy Formation Energy (OVFE):

SVDs generally lower the OVFE in both reducible (e.g., CeO2) and irreducible (e.g., MgO) oxides [10.1021/jp205432]. This reduction in OVFE can enhance catalytic activity by making lattice oxygen more readily available for reactions [10.1021/cr300418s\_8]. However, the effects of HVDs are more complex and dependent on the host oxide:

- In irreducible oxides like ZnO, HVDs (e.g., Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Re, La, Ce) substantially increase OVFE [10.1021/jp071671n].
- In reducible oxides like CeO2, HVDs (e.g., Nb, Ta) can lower OVFE by donating electrons to reduce host cations (e.g., Ce4+ to Ce3+) [10.1016/j.cplett.2010.04.035].

2. Influence on Catalytic Activity:

The impact of dopants on catalytic activity varies across different reactions and oxide systems:

- In TiO2, both SVDs (e.g., Mn, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au) and HVDs (e.g., V, Cr, Mo, W) typically enhance oxidation catalysis by lowering OVFE [10.1021/jp802296g].
- In CeO2, doping with Zr4+ (SVD) enhances CO oxidation by weakening Ce-O bonds and facilitating oxygen mobility [10.1007/s10562-010-0446-5].
- However, doping is not always beneficial. For instance, doping CeO2 with certain elements (e.g., Sm, Gd, La, Nb, Ta) can decrease its activity for n-butane oxidation and CO oxidation [10.1021/jp802296g].

3. Mechanisms of Dopant Effects:

The influence of dopants on catalytic properties can be attributed to several mechanisms:

- Electronic effects: HVDs can donate electrons to reduce host cations, affecting the oxide's redox properties [10.1021/jp205432].
- Structural effects: Dopants can alter bond lengths and coordination environments, affecting oxygen binding strength [10.1021/jp205432].
- Lewis acid-base interactions: HVDs can act as Lewis bases in irreducible oxides, enhancing adsorption of acidic species like O2 [10.1021/jp301341].

4. Challenges in Predicting Dopant Behavior:

Formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging due to:

- The complex interplay between electronic and structural effects induced by dopants [10.1021/jp205432].
- Differences in dopant behavior between reducible and irreducible host oxides [10.1021/jp301341].
- The formation of dopant-adsorbate complexes, which can alter dopant effects [10.1021/jp301341].
- The lack of clear correlations between OVFE and various properties of dopants (e.g., ionization energy, electronegativity) [10.1021/jp071671n].

5. Computational and Experimental Approaches:

Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have been crucial in understanding dopant effects, although limitations in accurately describing the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth oxides are acknowledged [10.1007/s10562-005-0014-6]. Experimental studies have provided valuable insights, but challenges persist in reliably measuring OVFE in oxide surfaces [10.1021/jp103604b].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The complex effects of dopants on metal oxide catalysts highlight the need for a more holistic approach to catalyst design. Future research directions may include:

1. Developing more sophisticated computational models that can accurately predict dopant behavior across a wide range of oxide systems and reaction conditions.

2. Exploring the potential of multi-dopant systems to fine-tune catalytic properties and overcome limitations of single-dopant approaches.

3. Investigating the role of dopants in emerging applications, such as electrocatalysis for renewable energy technologies and photocatalysis for environmental remediation.

4. Studying the long-term stability and dynamic behavior of doped oxide catalysts under realistic operating conditions to bridge the gap between fundamental studies and practical applications.

5. Developing high-throughput experimental and computational screening methods to rapidly identify promising dopant-oxide combinations for specific catalytic applications.

By addressing these challenges and opportunities, researchers can work towards more rational design of doped metal oxide catalysts with enhanced performance and stability for a wide range of industrial and environmental applications.

10 The Effect of High-Valence Dopants (HVDs)
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
10.1 Introduction
The effect of high-valence dopants on the chemistry of the host oxide is more complex than that of LVDs because it depends on whether the host is reducible or not. It is easiest to understand why this is so in terms of Lewis acid&ndash;base interactions. (221) In an irreducible oxide (e.g., ZnO), a high-valence dopant, such as Al, has one excess electron (two out of the three valence electrons of Al are used to “replace” Zn2+). This formal electron counting is not rigorous, but it is very helpful in understanding the behavior of an oxide doped with an HVD. If the host oxide is irreducible, this additional electron is localized on the dopant. (260, 272) This means that the dopant is a Lewis base, and this controls some of its chemistry. A high-valence dopant in a reducible oxide (e.g., Ta dopant in CeO2) behaves differently. (258) Because Ce4+ cations are easily reduced to Ce3+ (Ce4+ is a Lewis acid), an HVD can donate its “excess” electrons to reduce Ce ions in the host oxide. For example, (258) hexavalent W or Mo dopants donate two electrons and reduce two Ce4+ ions; pentavalent Ta or Nb dopants donate one electron and reduce one Ce4+ ion. Thus, these high-valence dopants are formally tetravalent, and as a result they do not affect reducible oxides in the same way they would affect the irreducible ones.
Because of this situation, we treat high-valence dopants in irreducible oxides separately from those in which the host oxide is reducible. We generalize the results of a small number of calculations to propose some qualitative rules that need to be tested by further calculations on similar systems.
10.2 HVDs in Irreducible Oxides
Pala et al. (271) examined the effect of all substitutional dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the surface of ZnO. They showed that all HVDs increased the energy needed for removing a surface oxygen atom located near the dopant. This suggests that the HVDs can be used to hinder oxidation by the Mars&ndash;van Krevelen mechanism. However, this does not necessarily mean that their presence converts the host oxide into a poor oxidation catalyst. If an oxidation reaction is performed with O2 (as opposed to other oxidants such as CO2), the oxygen, which is a strong Lewis acid, will bind to the high-valence dopant, which is a Lewis base. At this point, we need to distinguish two limiting cases. If the valence of the dopant exceeds that of the cation it substitutes by 1 (we call this an HVD1), then the adsorbed oxygen molecules gain one electron (formally) in an antibonding orbital. As a result, the bond length of the adsorbed species is substantially longer than that of gaseous O2, and the adsorbed species gains electron charge and closely resembles O2&ndash;. This is a reactive species, and when exposed to CO it makes a carbonate that decomposes to release CO2. This leads to what Pala et al. (359) called a “non-Mars&ndash;van Krevelen” mechanism: the oxygen atom from the oxidized product originates from the gas, not from the surface of the oxide. Experiments on CO oxidation by Al- or Ti-doped ZnO (359) confirmed this prediction: when the oxidation was performed with short pulses of gaseous 18O2, the CO2 produced in the reaction contained 18O.
A limited number of calculations on other systems suggest that the activation of the oxygen adsorbed on an HVD1 is likely to be general. For example, Zr-doped La2O3(001) binds an oxygen molecule (see Figure 4) with an energy release of 2.63 eV. The O2 molecule is not dissociated, but its bond length is 1.35 Å, which is longer than the bond length of gas-phase O2 and comparable to that of the gas-phase O2&ndash; ion. The adsorbed O2 makes use of the extra electrons on Zr; therefore, the ZrO2 group no longer has three electrons to form bonds with the oxide. Thus, ZrO2 creates an electron deficit in the system, which means that it acts as a low-valence dopant and turns the surface into a Lewis acid. If this qualitative model is correct, then the presence of ZrO2 should facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies. Calculations show that indeed it does: it takes only 0.96 eV to remove an oxygen atom next to the ZrO2 group and form 1/2O2 in the gas. There are now two kinds of active oxygen atoms in the system: the adsorbed O2 and any one of the three surface oxygen atoms neighboring the ZrO2 group. This is reflected in the manner in which methane adsorbs dissociatively in this system. In Figure 5, we show one final state for dissociative adsorption, in which H and CH3 bind to the oxygen atoms adsorbed from the gas phase (which, in turn, are bonded to the Zr dopant). This reaction is exoergic by 1.20 eV. A second final state is shown in Figure 6, where the methyl radical binds to one of the oxygen atoms previously adsorbed from the gas (to form a methoxide bound to Ru) and the other binds to one of the oxygen atoms in the surface layer, near to Ru, to form a hydroxyl. This reaction is exoergic by 1.04 eV. Similar results are obtained for La2O3 doped with Ti, and we propose that this kind of behavior is general for HVD1 dopants in irreducible host oxides. However, more calculations and more experiments are needed for establishing this statement firmly.
The situation is different in the limiting case of HVD2. An example is provide by Ta-doped La2O3(001) exposed to oxygen. The O2 molecule dissociates: one atom binds to Ta, and the other binds to a surface oxygen atom forming a sort of O2 molecule (dark yellow in Figure 7). The binding energy of O2 is 4.58 eV. Similar results were obtained for Nb-doped La2O3. Although not many studies of this kind are available, we believe that this very strong bond with oxygen is typical for HVD2 or HVD3. This means that these dopants bind oxygen too strongly and the complex formed in this way is too low in energy to participate in redox reactions. More studies are needed to confirm these qualitative statements.
10.3 HVDs in Reducible Oxides
Very few calculations have examined this kind of system. They allow us to make some guesses and extrapolations, but they need to be reinforced (or modified) by further work. By definition, the cation in a reducible oxide (e.g., CeO2, TiO2) can easily change its formal charge while interacting with electron-donating species (Lewis bases). The few existing calculations suggest that Lewis bases adsorbed on the surface are able to reduce Ce4+ to Ce3+ (or Ti4+ to Ti3+). For example, H (a Lewis base) reduces a Ce ion when it is adsorbed on CeO2 (360) and so does a Cu atom adsorbed on ceria. (335) Nolan (331) has examined oxygen-vacancy formation at the surface of CeO2 doped with La. Because La is an LVD, its presence creates a hole located on an oxygen atom, which acts as an acid site. When an oxygen vacancy is formed, two unpaired electrons are created: one fills the hole and the other reduces Ce4+ to Ce3+. In all calculations, the reducibility of Ce4+ is present only in DFT+U (with sufficiently large U) or when hybrid functionals are used. These statements are consistent with experiments, which show that the adsorption of H (a Lewis base) or the formation of an oxygen vacancy (a Lewis base) is accompanied by the appearance of Ce3+ or Ti3+ in the XPS or in the EPR spectra.
On the basis of these observations, we accept the suggestion that Ce4+ and Ti4+ can act as Lewis acids. It is also reasonable to assume that in the presence of oxygen in the gas, the high-valence dopant will adsorb oxygen and form either an MeO2 group or an MeO group. (262) This should happen because oxygen is a much stronger acid than Ti4+ or Ce4+. We are not aware of the existence of calculations that have examined whether such behavior extends to other reducible oxides (V2O5, Nb2O5, SnO2, MoO3, etc.). We hope that the conjectures made here will stimulate more calculations on HVDs in reducible oxides.
10.4 The Stability of High-Valence Dopants
This is a question that has received little attention so far even though it is on the mind of anyone performing experiments with doped oxides. Consider a high-valence dopant that forms a very stable oxide (e.g., Ta, Nb, La) with a high coordination to oxygen. Imagine that such a cation is used to dope an oxide (e.g., NiO, PbO2, CuO) that is less stable than the dopant’s oxide. One would suspect that such a dopant in contact with gas-phase oxygen might prefer to leave the cationic site, move on top of the surface, and adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to form an oxide cluster. If this structure has lower energy it is likely that it will become prevalent during calcination (when the doped oxide is prepared). The intended doped oxide ends up being a submonolayer (or a layer) of small dopant&ndash;oxide clusters covering a surface with cationic defects. A few exploratory calculations in our group show that this is the case for Cr-doped CeO2 and for Nb-doped NiO. As we have discussed earlier, it is very difficult to determine by experiments whether this “segregation” of the dopant takes place.
11 Same-Valence Dopants (SVDs) and Flexible-Valence Dopants (FVDs)
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Quite a bit of work has been devoted to the situation when the dopant and the cation being substituted have the same valence. Calculations have been performed to study the properties of TiO2 doped with Ce, (361) Zr, (361) and Pt (141) and of CeO2 doped with Zr, (229, 235, 255, 258, 334, 361, 362) or with Ti, (362) or Hf, (362) or Pd, (229) or Pt, (258) or Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb. (363) We note in particular a study by Mayernick and Janik (229) on methane activation by Zr-doped ceria. All of these calculations show that the dopant affects favorably the properties of the host oxide. We mention a few experimental papers, many of which investigated the modification of the oxygen release in CeO2 doped with same-valence dopants, such as Zr, (364-367) Ti, (365, 368-374) Sn, (375) or Sn. (376) Other studies investigated the redox properties of CeO2 doped with Ti, (377) CO oxidation by CeO2 doped with Pt, (378) water&ndash;gas shift by Pt-doped CeO2, (379) and methane oxidation by ZrCeO2. (380) In all cases, doping with an SVD improves performance. However, we were unable to formulate any simple rules regarding the SVDs in catalysis other than to say that they should be tried, especially if one tunes the properties of an oxide that is already an efficient catalyst.
Because we define the valence of a dopant by examining the stoichiometry of its stable oxides, we cannot assign a unique valence to dopants that have several stable oxides. For example, V2O5 and V2O3 are stable oxides, VO2 and VO are also stable but less so, and compounds with formulas VnO2n+1 and VnO2n&ndash;1 have also been prepared. Obviously vanadium is a very versatile atom capable of taking a variety of valences when binding to oxygen. If we dope an oxide whose cations are tetravalent (e.g., SnO2) with vanadium, should we assume that vanadium is an HVD (because V2O5 is stable) or an LVD (because V2O3 is stable)? There is no a priori answer to this question. More complications arise if one considers that tetravalent and divalent vanadium are also possible. This is why we classify a V-dopant in a MeO2 host oxide as being a flexible-valence dopant (FVD). Not much is known about the general behavior of such systems.
Nb is an FVD (Nb2O5 is the most stable Nb oxide but NbO2 and NbO are also stable), and if it dopes CeO2 it will donate an electron and reduce a cerium ion. (258, 330) Therefore, the formal valence of Nb is IV. It is interesting that if NO2 is adsorbed on the Nb-doped ceria surface an NO2&ndash; ion is formed. (330) NO2 is apparently a stronger acid than Ce4+, and it manages to capture the electron that Nb (a Lewis base) makes available. The conclusions drawn from these calculations are supported by experiments on V-doped SnO2 catalysts, which consist, when the concentration of V is low, of a solid solution in which vanadium is V4+.
Another interesting example of flexible-valence dopant is provided by Cr-doped ceria. Experiments in Hegde’s group (381, 382) indicated that this doped oxide contains Ce3+ and Ce4+ as well as Cr4+ and Cr6+. Cr-doped ceria is a very good oxygen storage material (when heated it releases O2 at ∼350 °C). The as-prepared compound has an excess of oxygen (the proposed formula is Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11). While the amount of Cr in Hegde’s study is uncomfortably high (most solid solutions are not stable at such high concentrations of dopant), the XRD measurements show that no Cr oxide is present and the system has the fluorite structure of CeO2. Calculations in our group found that this system has very peculiar behavior. In general, doping CeO2(111) with a high-valence dopant distorts slightly the position of the oxygen atoms surrounding the dopant. Cr makes three stable oxides, CrO3, CrO2, and Cr2O3, so it is therefore capable of being hexa-, tetra-, or trivalent, which makes it a flexible-valence dopant. Calculations in which one Ce ion in the CeO2(111) surface is replaced with a Cr atom show that this system has six different geometries whose energy differs by at most 0.26 eV from the lowest energy one. Two of the structures are practically degenerate and have the lowest energy. In one of these Cr binds to five oxygen atoms, one of which is pulled out of its lattice site by ∼1 Å. We call this the CrO5 structure. When the oxygen atom is pulled out of its lattice site, a vacant oxygen-lattice site is created, and we call this a pseudo oxygen vacancy (“pseudo” because the O atom has been removed from its lattice site but not from the surface). In addition to having a pseudo vacancy, the system also has a reduced Ce atom. In another structure, with practically the same energy as CrO5, the Cr dopant binds to four oxygen atoms, makes one pseudo oxygen vacancy, and reduces two Ce ions to Ce3+. A dopant causing such large distortions of oxygen positions is unusual. Both the CrO4 and the CrO5 structures adsorb oxygen from the gas phase, and the reaction
is exoergic by 1 eV for CrO4 and 0.7 eV for CrO5. This means that excess oxygen is present in the system, and this might explain why Hegde et al. found that the stoichiometric formula of the compound is Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11. The calculations show that the compound formed by oxygen adsorption on Cr-doped ceria is a strong oxidant.
The examples presented here suggest that it may be difficult to find simple rules for the effects of flexible-valence dopants, especially if the host oxide is a reducible. More computational and experimental work is needed for clarifying the behavior of these systems.
