How do same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, and what insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications? Additionally, what challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)?

The provided literature does not contain information specifically addressing the effects of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of metal oxides. The document focuses on the properties and behavior of ceria-zirconia mixed oxides (Ce1-xZrxO2) nanoparticles, but does not discuss SVDs or HVDs in general or their impacts on other metal oxide catalysts. There is no information about computational or experimental studies comparing SVDs and HVDs across different oxide systems, nor any discussion of challenges in formulating predictive rules for dopant behavior considering factors like Lewis acid-base interactions or the nature of the host oxide. The literature does not provide sufficient information to answer the question as posed.

The document focuses on the properties and behavior of cerium-zirconium mixed oxides (Ce1-xZrxO2) nanoparticles, but does not discuss SVDs or HVDs in general or their impacts on various catalytic applications. 

The literature also does not provide insights from computational and experimental studies regarding SVD and HVD effects on catalytic performance across different metal oxide systems. While it does include some density functional (DF) calculations and experimental results for Ce1-xZrxO2, these are not framed in terms of SVD vs HVD comparisons.

Additionally, the document does not address challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, nor does it discuss factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions or compare reducible vs. irreducible host oxides in this context.

Given the lack of relevant information in the provided literature, this specific question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the given text. A more comprehensive review of literature focused on dopant effects in various metal oxide catalysts would be necessary to address these topics.

给定的科学文献并未包含特别针对同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对不同金属氧化物催化性能影响的信息。该文档主要关注铈-锆混合氧化物(Ce1-xZrxO2)纳米颗粒的性质和行为，但并未讨论SVDs或HVDs的一般情况或它们对各种催化应用的影响。

文献也未提供关于SVD和HVD对不同金属氧化物系统催化性能影响的计算和实验研究见解。虽然它确实包含了一些针对Ce1-xZrxO2的密度泛函(DF)计算和实验结果，但这些并未从SVD与HVD比较的角度进行阐述。

此外，该文档未涉及制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战，也未在此背景下讨论诸如Lewis酸碱相互作用等因素，或比较可还原与不可还原宿主氧化物。

鉴于所提供的文献中缺乏相关信息，仅基于给定的文本无法充分回答这个具体问题。要解决这些主题，需要对聚焦于各种金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂效应的文献进行更全面的回顾。
