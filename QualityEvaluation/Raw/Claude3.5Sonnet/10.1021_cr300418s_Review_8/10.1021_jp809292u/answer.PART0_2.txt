[1] "Doping of ceria with other metallic elements, such as Zr, has been shown to enhance thermal stability (9, 10) and to promote catalytic activity. (9-17) It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria, (6, 9-18) by weakening the bonds to the oxide of the oxygen atoms around the dopant."

[2] "A number of computational studies have demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is lower when the surface is doped with Zr, (9, 10, 17) Pt, (19) Pd, (20) and Au, (6, 18) among others."

[3] "These dopants have formal 4+ oxidation states, which means that there are no issues with charge compensation or oxygen hole formation processes."

[4] "Consistent with the substantial reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy, the energy gain upon adsorption of CO is notably larger on the doped surfaces."

[5] "Thus, on Zr- and Hf-doped ceria, the adsorption of NO is least favorable, and on Ti-doped ceria, NO adsorption is most favorable, with the undoped surface being intermediate."

The literature provides insights into how same-valence dopants (SVDs) influence the catalytic properties of ceria, a reducible metal oxide. Specifically:

1. SVDs like Ti, Zr, and Hf enhance the oxidative power of ceria by reducing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation. This facilitates the reduction of ceria and promotes catalytic activity.

2. Computational studies have shown that doping with elements like Zr, Pt, Pd, and Au lowers the oxygen vacancy formation energy in ceria.

3. The use of dopants with the same formal oxidation state as Ce (4+) avoids issues related to charge compensation or oxygen hole formation.

4. Doped surfaces show a larger energy gain upon CO adsorption compared to undoped surfaces, indicating enhanced reactivity for CO oxidation.

5. Different dopants affect NO adsorption differently, with Ti-doped ceria showing the most favorable NO adsorption among the studied dopants.

The literature does not provide specific information on high-valence dopants (HVDs) or their effects on irreducible oxides. It also does not discuss challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior or factors like Lewis acid-base interactions. The focus is primarily on same-valence dopants in ceria, a reducible oxide.

To fully answer the question, more comprehensive studies comparing SVDs and HVDs across different metal oxides, both reducible and irreducible, would be needed. Additionally, research addressing the challenges in predicting dopant behavior and considering factors like Lewis acid-base interactions would be required to formulate general rules for dopant effects on catalytic properties.

该文献提供了关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)如何影响可还原金属氧化物二氧化铈的催化性能的见解。具体来说：

1. 像Ti、Zr和Hf这样的SVDs通过降低氧空位形成所需的能量来增强二氧化铈的氧化能力。这有助于二氧化铈的还原和促进催化活性。

2. 计算研究表明，用Zr、Pt、Pd和Au等元素掺杂可以降低二氧化铈中的氧空位形成能。

3. 使用与Ce具有相同正式氧化态(4+)的掺杂剂可以避免与电荷补偿或氧空穴形成相关的问题。

4. 与未掺杂表面相比，掺杂表面在CO吸附时显示出更大的能量增益，表明CO氧化反应性增强。

5. 不同的掺杂剂对NO吸附的影响不同，在研究的掺杂剂中，Ti掺杂的二氧化铈显示出最有利的NO吸附。

该文献没有提供关于高价掺杂剂(HVDs)或它们对不可还原氧化物的影响的具体信息。它也没有讨论制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战，或诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用等因素。重点主要是二氧化铈这种可还原氧化物中的同价掺杂剂。

要完整回答这个问题，需要更全面的研究来比较SVDs和HVDs在不同金属氧化物（包括可还原和不可还原的）中的作用。此外，还需要研究解决预测掺杂剂行为的挑战，并考虑诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用等因素，以制定掺杂剂对催化性能影响的一般规则。
