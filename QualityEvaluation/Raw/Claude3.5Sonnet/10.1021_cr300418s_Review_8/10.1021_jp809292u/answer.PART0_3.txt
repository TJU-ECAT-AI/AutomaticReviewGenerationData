[1] "Doping of ceria with other metallic elements, such as Zr, has been shown to enhance thermal stability (9, 10) and to promote catalytic activity. (9-17) It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria, (6, 9-18) by weakening the bonds to the oxide of the oxygen atoms around the dopant."

[2] "A number of computational studies have demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is lower when the surface is doped with Zr, (9, 10, 17) Pt, (19) Pd, (20) and Au, (6, 18) among others."

[3] "Replacing a Ce atom on ceria surfaces [the (111) surface for Zr, Pt, Pd, and Au and (110) and (100) for Au] enhances CO oxidation; the CeO and dopantO bonds are weakened upon formation of the doped material, reducing the oxygen vacancy formation energy and enhancing the reactivity of the surface."

[4] "These dopants have formal 4+ oxidation states, which means that there are no issues with charge compensation or oxygen hole formation processes."

[5] "When doped with these elements, the oxidative power of ceria is enhanced: a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy is needed, CO adsorbs more strongly at the doped surface, and we expect CO oxidation to be enhanced. On the other hand, the reductive power of ceria could be correspondingly reduced: NO adsorption is weaker and, crucially, so is adsorption of two NO molecules at a defective surface."

The literature provides insights on how same-valence dopants (SVDs) influence the catalytic properties of ceria, a reducible metal oxide. SVDs like Ti, Zr, and Hf enhance the oxidative power of ceria by lowering the oxygen vacancy formation energy and strengthening CO adsorption, thus promoting CO oxidation. However, this comes at the cost of reduced reductive power, as evidenced by weaker NO adsorption.

Computational studies have shown that doping with elements like Zr, Pt, Pd, and Au lowers the oxygen vacancy formation energy in ceria. This is attributed to the weakening of Ce-O and dopant-O bonds, which enhances the reactivity of the surface.

The use of dopants with the same oxidation state as Ce (4+) avoids issues related to charge compensation or oxygen hole formation. This simplifies the analysis of dopant effects on catalytic properties.

While the literature provides valuable insights into the effects of SVDs on ceria, it does not discuss high-valence dopants (HVDs) or other metal oxides in detail. The study focuses primarily on ceria and a limited set of dopants, making it challenging to formulate general predictive rules for dopant behavior across different oxide systems.

The literature does not explicitly address Lewis acid-base interactions or compare reducible and irreducible oxides. These aspects, along with a broader range of dopants and host oxides, would need to be studied to develop more comprehensive predictive rules for dopant behavior in catalytic applications.

文献提供了关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)如何影响可还原金属氧化物氧化铈的催化性能的见解。Ti、Zr和Hf等SVDs通过降低氧空位形成能和增强CO吸附来提高氧化铈的氧化能力，从而促进CO氧化。然而，这是以降低还原能力为代价的，这从较弱的NO吸附可以看出。

计算研究表明，用Zr、Pt、Pd和Au等元素掺杂可以降低氧化铈中的氧空位形成能。这归因于Ce-O和掺杂剂-O键的减弱，从而增强了表面的反应活性。

使用与Ce相同氧化态(4+)的掺杂剂可以避免与电荷补偿或氧空穴形成相关的问题。这简化了对掺杂剂对催化性能影响的分析。

虽然文献对SVDs对氧化铈的影响提供了宝贵的见解，但它并未详细讨论高价掺杂剂(HVDs)或其他金属氧化物。该研究主要集中在氧化铈和有限的一组掺杂剂上，这使得难以制定适用于不同氧化物系统的掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则。

文献没有明确讨论路易斯酸碱相互作用，也没有比较可还原和不可还原的氧化物。这些方面，以及更广泛的掺杂剂和宿主氧化物范围，需要进行研究，以制定更全面的掺杂剂在催化应用中行为的预测规则。
