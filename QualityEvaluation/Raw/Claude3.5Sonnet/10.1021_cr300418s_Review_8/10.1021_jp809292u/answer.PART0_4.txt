[1] "Doping of ceria with other metallic elements, such as Zr, has been shown to enhance thermal stability (9, 10) and to promote catalytic activity. (9-17) It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria, (6, 9-18) by weakening the bonds to the oxide of the oxygen atoms around the dopant."

[2] "A number of computational studies have demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is lower when the surface is doped with Zr, (9, 10, 17) Pt, (19) Pd, (20) and Au, (6, 18) among others."

[3] "We used density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) to study the effect of doping the (110) surface of ceria with Ti, Zr, and Hf on CO adsorption and NO reduction, as well as the energetics of CO oxidation to CO2 and NO reduction to N2."

[4] "These dopants have formal 4+ oxidation states, which means that there are no issues with charge compensation or oxygen hole formation processes."

[5] "Consistent with the substantial reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy, the energy gain upon adsorption of CO is notably larger on the doped surfaces."

[6] "Thus, the correlation between oxygen vacancy formation and surface reduction and reoxidation is clear: enhancing oxygen vacancy formation will enhance the interaction of CO with a doped ceria surface, but the tradeoff will be that the interaction of NOx with the doped surface will not be as favorable."

The literature primarily discusses same-valence dopants (SVDs) like Ti, Zr, and Hf in ceria, rather than comparing SVDs and high-valence dopants (HVDs) across different metal oxides. However, some insights can be drawn from the information provided:

1. Effect on catalytic properties:
   - SVDs like Zr in ceria enhance thermal stability and promote catalytic activity.
   - They facilitate the reduction of ceria by weakening the bonds between oxygen atoms and the oxide around the dopant.
   - Doping lowers the oxygen vacancy formation energy, which is crucial for catalytic activity.

2. Computational and experimental insights:
   - Computational studies have shown that doping with Zr, Pt, Pd, and Au lowers the oxygen vacancy formation energy in ceria.
   - DFT+U calculations were used to study the effects of Ti, Zr, and Hf doping on CO adsorption and NO reduction on ceria (110) surface.
   - These studies reveal enhanced CO adsorption on doped surfaces due to the reduction in oxygen vacancy formation energy.

3. Challenges in formulating general predictive rules:
   - The study focuses on specific dopants (Ti, Zr, Hf) with 4+ oxidation states, avoiding issues of charge compensation or oxygen hole formation.
   - The trade-off between enhanced CO oxidation and potentially reduced NO reduction on doped surfaces suggests complex relationships between dopant effects and different catalytic processes.
   - The study does not provide a comprehensive comparison across different metal oxides or between SVDs and HVDs, limiting the ability to formulate general predictive rules.

While the literature provides valuable insights into the effects of specific SVDs on ceria's catalytic properties, it does not offer a broad comparison between SVDs and HVDs across various metal oxides. The study highlights the complexity of dopant effects on different catalytic processes, emphasizing the need for further research to develop more comprehensive predictive rules for dopant behavior in catalytic applications.

该文献主要讨论了像Ti、Zr和Hf这样的同价掺杂剂（SVDs）在氧化铈中的作用，而不是比较不同金属氧化物中SVDs和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）的效果。然而，我们可以从所提供的信息中得出一些见解：

1. 对催化性能的影响：
   - 像Zr这样的SVDs在氧化铈中可以提高热稳定性并促进催化活性。
   - 它们通过削弱掺杂剂周围氧原子与氧化物之间的键来促进氧化铈的还原。
   - 掺杂降低了氧空位形成能，这对催化活性至关重要。

2. 计算和实验见解：
   - 计算研究表明，用Zr、Pt、Pd和Au掺杂可以降低氧化铈中的氧空位形成能。
   - 使用DFT+U计算来研究Ti、Zr和Hf掺杂对氧化铈(110)表面CO吸附和NO还原的影响。
   - 这些研究揭示了由于氧空位形成能的降低，掺杂表面上CO吸附增强。

3. 制定通用预测规则的挑战：
   - 研究集中在具有4+氧化态的特定掺杂剂（Ti、Zr、Hf），避免了电荷补偿或氧空穴形成的问题。
   - 掺杂表面上CO氧化增强与NO还原可能减弱之间的权衡表明，掺杂剂效应与不同催化过程之间存在复杂关系。
   - 该研究没有提供不同金属氧化物之间或SVDs和HVDs之间的全面比较，限制了制定通用预测规则的能力。

虽然文献为氧化铈中特定SVDs对催化性能的影响提供了宝贵的见解，但它没有提供不同金属氧化物中SVDs和HVDs之间的广泛比较。该研究强调了掺杂剂对不同催化过程影响的复杂性，强调了需要进一步研究以制定更全面的催化应用中掺杂剂行为预测规则。
