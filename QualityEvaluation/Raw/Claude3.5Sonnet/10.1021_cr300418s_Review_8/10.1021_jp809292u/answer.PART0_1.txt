[1] "Doping of ceria with other metallic elements, such as Zr, has been shown to enhance thermal stability (9, 10) and to promote catalytic activity. (9-17) It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria, (6, 9-18) by weakening the bonds to the oxide of the oxygen atoms around the dopant."

[2] "A number of computational studies have demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is lower when the surface is doped with Zr, (9, 10, 17) Pt, (19) Pd, (20) and Au, (6, 18) among others."

[3] "These dopants have formal 4+ oxidation states, which means that there are no issues with charge compensation or oxygen hole formation processes."

[4] "When doped with these elements, the oxidative power of ceria is enhanced: a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy is needed, CO adsorbs more strongly at the doped surface, and we expect CO oxidation to be enhanced. On the other hand, the reductive power of ceria could be correspondingly reduced: NO adsorption is weaker and, crucially, so is adsorption of two NO molecules at a defective surface."

The literature provides insights primarily on same-valence dopants (SVDs) in ceria, particularly Ti, Zr, and Hf. These dopants influence catalytic properties in several ways:

1. They enhance the thermal stability and catalytic activity of ceria.

2. They facilitate the reduction of ceria by weakening the bonds between oxygen atoms and the oxide around the dopant.

3. Computational studies show that SVDs lower the oxygen vacancy formation energy, which is crucial for catalytic activity.

4. SVDs enhance the oxidative power of ceria, leading to stronger CO adsorption and potentially improved CO oxidation.

5. However, they may reduce the reductive power of ceria, resulting in weaker NO adsorption.

The study doesn't directly compare SVDs to high-valence dopants (HVDs), nor does it discuss their effects on other metal oxides. It also doesn't address challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior or factors like Lewis acid-base interactions.

The research suggests that the impact of dopants on catalytic performance is complex, with potential trade-offs between oxidative and reductive capabilities. This complexity highlights the need for further studies to develop more comprehensive predictive models for dopant behavior in various metal oxide systems.

该文献主要提供了关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)在氧化铈中的作用，特别是Ti、Zr和Hf。这些掺杂剂以几种方式影响催化性能：

1. 它们提高了氧化铈的热稳定性和催化活性。

2. 它们通过削弱掺杂剂周围氧原子与氧化物之间的键合，促进了氧化铈的还原。

3. 计算研究表明，SVDs降低了氧空位形成能，这对催化活性至关重要。

4. SVDs增强了氧化铈的氧化能力，导致CO吸附更强，可能改善CO氧化。

5. 然而，它们可能降低氧化铈的还原能力，导致NO吸附减弱。

该研究没有直接比较SVDs和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)，也没有讨论它们对其他金属氧化物的影响。它也没有涉及制定掺杂剂行为通用预测规则的挑战，或诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用等因素。

研究表明，掺杂剂对催化性能的影响是复杂的，氧化和还原能力之间可能存在权衡。这种复杂性突出了进行进一步研究的必要性，以便为各种金属氧化物系统中的掺杂剂行为开发更全面的预测模型。
