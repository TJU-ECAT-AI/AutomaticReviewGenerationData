How do same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, and what insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications? Additionally, what challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)?

The given literature does not contain any information about same-valence dopants (SVDs) or high-valence dopants (HVDs) and their influence on the catalytic properties of metal oxides. The document focuses on the structural characterization of CeO2-TiO2 and V2O5/CeO2-TiO2 catalysts using various analytical techniques, but does not discuss the effects of different types of dopants or their impact on catalytic applications. The text also does not address challenges in formulating predictive rules for dopant behavior or factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions in the context of host oxides. As such, the question cannot be answered based on the information provided in this document.

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. The text focuses on the characterization of CeO2-TiO2 and V2O5/CeO2-TiO2 catalysts using various techniques like XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and XPS. It does not discuss computational studies on dopant effects or challenges in formulating predictive rules for dopant behavior. The document lacks information on Lewis acid-base interactions in the context of dopants and does not compare reducible vs. irreducible host oxides. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
