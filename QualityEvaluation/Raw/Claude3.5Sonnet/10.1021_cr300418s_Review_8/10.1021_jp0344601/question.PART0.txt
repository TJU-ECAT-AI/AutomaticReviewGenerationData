Abstract
Structural characteristics of ceriatitania and vanadia/ceriatitania mixed oxides have been investigated using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The (1:1 mole ratio) mixed oxide was obtained by a coprecipitation method, and a nominal 5 wt % V2O5 was deposited over its surface by a wet impregnation technique. Both of the materials were then subjected to thermal treatments from 773 to 1073 K and were characterized by the above-mentioned techniques. The XRD results suggest that the CeO2TiO2 mixed oxide calcined at 773 K primarily consists of poorly crystalline CeO2 and TiO2-anatase phases and that a better crystallization of these oxides occurs with increasing calcination temperature. The a cell-parameter values suggest some incorporation of titanium into the ceria lattice. Impregnation of vanadia on ceriatitania enhances the crystallization of CeO2 and TiO2 oxides. However, no crystalline V2O5 could be observed from XRD and RS measurements. Furthermore, the dispersed molecular vanadium oxide (polyvanadate), evidenced by Raman measurements, interacts preferentially with the CeO2 portion of the mixed oxides and forms the CeVO4 compound at higher calcination temperatures. The XRD and RS results provide direct evidence about the formation of CeVO4. The XPS electron-binding energies indicate that ceria, titania, and vanadia are mainly in their highest oxidation states, Ce(IV), Ti(IV), and V(V). The formation of Ce(III) has also been noticed in both CeO2TiO2 and V2O5/CeO2TiO2 samples at all temperatures.

Introduction
Ceria-based materials have been receiving enormous attention recently owing to their broad range of applications in various fields. 1 CeO2 is a well-known additive in the so-called three-way catalysts for automobile exhaust treatment. 2 In particular, supported CeO2 and CeO2-based mixed oxides are the effective catalysts for the reactions of oxidation of different hydrocarbons and for the removal of total organic carbon from polluted waters from different sources. 3-6 The presence of CeO2 promotes various catalytic reactions such as CO2 activation, 7 CO oxidation,3 and CO/NO removal. 8 In all of these applications, two features are mainly responsible for making CeO2 a promising material for use either as a support or as an active catalyst. These are (a) the redox couple Ce3+/Ce4+, with the ability of ceria to shift between CeO2 and Ce2O3 under oxidizing and reducing conditions, respectively, and (b) the ease of formation of labile oxygen vacancies and particularly the relatively high mobility of bulk oxygen species. 9 However, pure ceria is known to be poorly thermostable and undergoes rapid sintering under high-temperature applications, thereby loosing oxygen buffer capacity. 10,11 Therefore, there are several attempts in the literature to overcome this problem. One approach among them is the substitution of another metal or metal oxide into the ceria lattice, thereby facilitating the formation of mixed oxides. 12-17 Replacing cerium ions by cations of different size and/or charge modifies ion mobility inside the modified lattice, resulting in the formation of a defective fluorite-structured solid solution. Such modifications in the defect structure of ceria confer new properties to the catalyst such as better resistance to sintering at high temperatures and high catalytic activity for various reactions. 18 The mixing of two different oxides also adds another parameter because they are liable to form new stable compounds that may lead to totally different physicochemical properties and catalytic behavior.17
Motivated by the favorable characteristics of ceria-based mixed oxides or solid solutions, their preparation and characterization has been the objective of a great number of investigations recently. There are several studies in the literature on the dispersion and surface structure of V2O5 on TiO2 and CeO2 single oxides. 19-21 However, there is no report, to the best of our knowledge, on the nature of V-oxide species and their chemical stability on CeO2TiO2 mixed oxides. Both cerium and titanium cations have multiple stable oxidation states, and the CeO2 and TiO2 surfaces can be relatively easily reduced. Vanadium oxide is also a well-known redox material used in many industrial catalysts for selective oxidation and ammoxidation reactions. 22-29 Therefore, an effort has been made in the present study to understand the evolution and physicochemical characteristics of CeO2TiO2 and V2O5/CeO2TiO2 mixed oxides of great commercial significance for various purposes. The CeO2TiO2 mixed oxide was prepared by a homogeneous coprecipitation method and was impregnated with a nominal 5 wt % V2O5. The CeO2TiO2 and V2O5/CeO2TiO2 samples were subjected to thermal treatments from 773 to 1073 K and were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (RS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and other techniques.
Experimental Section
Preparation of Samples. The CeO2TiO2 (1:1 mole ratio based on oxides) mixed oxide was prepared from CeCl3·7H2O (99.0%, Aldrich) and TiCl4 (99.9%, Aldrich) by hydrolysis with aqueous ammonia solution. The cerium chloride salt was dissolved in distilled water to the desired concentration (0.1 M). To make titanium chloride solution, TiCl4 was first digested in cold concentrated HCl and then diluted with distilled water. To the cerium and titanium chloride mixture solutions, dilute liquid ammonia was added dropwise with vigorous stirring until the precipitation was complete. The gel product was heated slowly to 363368 K on a hot plate with vigorous stirring to facilitate aging. The product was filtered off and washed several times with distilled water until no chlorides could be detected with Ag+ in the filtrate. The obtained cake was oven dried at 393 K for 12 h and finally calcined at 773 K for 5 h. Some portion of the calcined mixed oxide was once again heated at 873, 973, and 1073 K for 6 h. The V2O5/CeO2TiO2 sample, containing 5 wt % V2O5 to obtain a theoretical monolayer coverage on the support surface,24 was prepared by a standard wet impregnation method from NH4VO3 (99%, Fluka) dissolved in aqueous oxalic acid solution (1 M). To this aqueous solution, the finely powdered calcined (773 K) CeO2TiO2 support was added. The excess water was evaporated on a water bath, and the resulting material was oven dried at 393 K for 12 h and subsequently calcined at 773 K for 5 h in an oxygen atmosphere. Some portion of the finished catalyst was once again heated at 873, 973 and 1073 K for 5 h.
Characterization Techniques. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Siemens D-500 diffractometer using a nickel-filtered Cu Kα (0.15418 nm) radiation source. The intensity data were collected over a 2θ range of 380 with a 0.02 step size using a counting time of 1 s per point. Crystalline phases were identified by comparison with the reference data from ICDD files. The average crystallite size of CeO2 was estimated with the help of the DebyeScherrer equation using the XRD data of all prominent lines. 30
The Raman spectra were obtained on a DILORXY spectrometer equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled CCD detector. The emission line at 514.5 nm from an Ar+ laser (Spectra Physics) was focused on the sample under a microscope, and the analyzed spot was 1 μm. The power of the incident beam on the sample was 3 mW. The time of acquisition was adjusted according to the intensity of the Raman scattering. The wavenumber values reported from the spectra are accurate to within 2 cm-1.
The BET surface areas were determined by N2 adsorption using a Micromeritics Gemini 2360 instrument. Prior to analysis, the samples were oven dried at 393 K for 12 h and flushed with argon gas for 2 h.
The XPS measurements were performed on a Shimadzu (ESCA 3400) spectrometer by using Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) radiation as the excitation source. Charging of the catalyst samples was corrected by setting the binding energy of the adventitious carbon (C 1s) to 284.6 eV. 31,32 The XPS analysis was done at ambient temperature and pressures typically on the order of less than 10-6 Pa. Prior to analysis, the samples were outgassed in a vacuum oven overnight.
Results and Discussion
The N2 BET surface areas of CeO2TiO2 and V2O5/CeO2TiO2 samples calcined at various temperatures are shown in Table 1. The CeO2TiO2 mixed oxide calcined at 773 K exhibited a BET surface area of 59 m2 g-1. As can be observed from Table 1, there is a decrease in the specific surface area with increasing calcination temperature. This is primarily due to the sintering of the samples at higher calcination temperatures. Additionally, compound formation between ceria and titania with varying stoichiometries at higher calcination temperatures cannot be ruled out. This aspect has been elaborated on in subsequent paragraphs. The 5% V2O5/CeO2TiO2 sample calcined at 773 K exhibited a BET surface area of 44 m2 g-1. With increasing calcination temperature, a substantial decrease in the surface area can be observed. The decrease in the surface area after impregnating with vanadium pentoxide and subjecting the samples to higher calcination temperatures could be due to various factors such as penetration of the dispersed vanadium oxide into the pores of the support, thereby narrowing its pore diameter and blocking some of the pores and solid-state reactions between the dispersed vanadium oxide and the supporting oxides.24,33,34 The XRD measurements presented in the succeeding paragraphs provide evidence for the latter possibility.

Figure 1 shows the X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the CeO2TiO2 sample calcined at different temperatures. The XRD measurements provide typical diffraction patterns of cubic CeO2 (PDF-ICDD 34-0394) along with a few less-intense peaks due to the TiO2 anatase phase (PDF-ICDD 21-1272). With increasing calcination temperature, a slight increase in the intensity of the lines due to both of these phases can be observed. Preuss and Gruehn reported various CeTiO oxides, namely, Ce2TiO5, Ce2Ti2O7, and Ce4Ti9O24, by heating the appropriate mixtures of solids containing Ce and Ti at 1523 K. 35 However, no such crystalline phases could be seen in the present study. The absence of crystalline CeTiO compounds may be due to a different preparation method adopted and lower calcination temperatures employed in the present investigation. It is an established fact in the literature that the transformation of anatase to rutile is thermodynamically feasible beyond 873 K in impurity-free TiO2 samples. 24,36 In the present study, there is no evidence for the formation of the rutile phase even up to 1073 K. It appears from the present results that the anatase-to-rutile phase transformation is somehow inhibited in the CeO2TiO2 mixed oxides. As explained by Lin and Yu, 37 this phenomenon could be due to the stabilization of anatase by the surrounding cerium ions through the formation of CeOTi bonds. At the interface, titanium atoms are expected to substitute for cerium in the lattice of the cerium oxide to form octahedral Ti sites. The interaction between the tetrahedral Ti and octahedral Ti inhibits the phase transformation to rutile.36 Anderson and Bard offered an analogous explanation for TiO2SiO2 mixed oxides where a similar inhibition of anatase-to-rutile phase transformation was observed. 38

The XRD patterns of a 5% V2O5/CeO2TiO2 sample calcined at various temperatures are presented in Figure 2. Along with the prominent diffraction lines of cubic CeO2 and the TiO2 anatase phase, a few new diffraction peaks that can be attributed to the formation the CeVO4 compound (PDF-ICDD 12-0757) are also observed. The intensity of all of these lines increased with increasing calcination temperature. No diffraction lines due to crystalline V2O5 are observed. A few lines with less intensity can be seen at 1073 K; these could be assigned to the TiO2 rutile phase (PDF-ICDD 21-1276). There are also some weak extra lines that cannot be assigned to any known crystalline compounds. The absence of the crystalline V2O5 phase and the preferential formation of the CeVO4 compound indicates that the dispersed vanadium oxide selectively interacts with the ceria portion of the CeO2TiO2 mixed oxide and forms this stable oxide. It is a well-known fact in the literature that dispersed vanadium oxide on titania anatase accelerates the phase transformation from anatase to rutile. During this phase transformation, some of the V2O5 is reduced and gets incorporated into the rutile structure as VxTi(1-x)O2 (rutile solid solution).24 The preferential formation of the CeVO4 compound at T  773 K because of solid-state reactions between the dispersed vanadium oxide and the ceria portion of the CeO2TiO2 mixed oxide seems to be an interesting observation from this study. The formation of the CeVO4 phase can be explained by taking into account the charge-to-radius ratio of the mixed oxides as envisaged by Bond et al.24 The formation of surface compounds or unidimensional layers of vanadium oxide on various oxide supports has been related to the ratio of the charge of the support cation to the sum of the radii of cation and oxide ions (q/r).24 Normally, lower q/r ratios favor surface compound formation.24 The q/r ratio for vanadiaceria combination is lower because the radius of Ce4+ (0.97 Å) is higher than that of Ti4+ (0.64 Å). Therefore, the dispersed vanadium oxide is expected to interact selectively with the ceria portion of the mixed oxide, thereby leading to the formation of a crystalline CeVO4 surface compound. The PZC (point of zero charge or pH at surface neutrality) values reported in the literature also support the above observation. 39,40 The PZC of ceria (8.10.1) is much higher than that of titania (5.90.1), making it more basic. Therefore, a highly feasible acidbase interaction can be expected between the dispersed vanadium oxide and ceria, leading to the formation of the CeVO4 compound.

The crystallite size (DXRD) of CeO2 in various samples as a function of calcination temperature is summarized in Table 1. It appears from Table 1 that the CeO2 crystallization depends both on the calcination temperature and the presence of dispersed vanadium oxide over its surface. An increase in the crystallite size of CeO2 is observed with increasing calcination temperature, the increase being greater in the case of V2O5/CeO2TiO2 samples. This is due to the accelerating effect of dispersed vanadium oxide on the crystallization of ceria, a well-known fact documented in the literature.24,36,41,42 The a cell-parameter values for the CeO2 (111) base peak, calculated using the cubic indexation method, are also presented in Table 1. 43,44 The lattice parameters were estimated to determine whether Ti4+ could enter into the CeO2 lattice, resulting in the formation of solid solutions. The a cell-parameter values obtained at 773 and 873 K are in good agreement with the pure CeO2 (100%) phase.44 A subsequent decline in the a cell-parameter values with increasing calcination temperature can be taken as evidence for the substitution of Ti4+ in the ceria unit cell because the Ti4+ ionic radius (0.64 Å) is smaller than that of Ce4+ (0.97 Å).
The Raman spectra of CeO2TiO2 and V2O5/CeO2TiO2 samples calcined at different temperatures are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. As presented in Figure 3, the Raman spectrum of the CeO2TiO2 sample calcined at 773 K shows the typical spectra of TiO2 anatase (space group I41/amd)40 and CeO2. 45 The Raman bands pertaining to the anatase phase appear at 147, 196, 397, 514, and 638 cm-1, whereas ceria exhibits peaks at 272, 463, and 570 cm-1, which are in agreement with the literature report.45 To explain the presence of ceria Raman peaks, it is necessary to recall its space group and vibrationalmodes. Ceria crystallizes in the cubic fluorite-type lattice and belongs to the space group Fm3m.45 This structure possesses six optical-phonon branches, among which three zone-center frequencies at ca. 272, 463, and 595 cm-1 are ascribed to the doubly degenerate TO (transverse optical) mode, the triply degenerate Raman-active mode, and the nondegenerate LO (longitudinal optical) mode, respectively. 46 In general, the Raman mode at ca. 463 cm-1 can be directly detected by spectral measurements. This mode, assigned to F2g symmetry, can be viewed as a symmetric breathing mode of the oxygen atoms around cerium ions. McBride et al. 47 reported the Raman spectra of Ce1-xRExO2-y (RE = rare earth) solid solutions and found that the F2g mode becomes asymmetric with the presence of a long low-frequency tail as x increases, and there is also a weak shoulder on the high-frequency side of the band, which would evolve into a broad peak at ca. 570 cm-1 for a larger x. This broad peak is associated with oxygen vacancies in the solid solutions. 46,48 A similar phenomenon is apparent in the present study. The XPS measurements presented in the latter paragraphs provide information about the formation of Ce3+ ions, supporting this observation. In line with XRD results, there are a few extra Raman bands that could not be assigned to any known compounds.

As presented in Figure 4, the Raman spectra of the V2O5/CeO2TiO2 sample calcined at 773 K exhibit prominent peaks due to the titania anatase phase and the ceria cubic phase along with broad and less intense bands in the region of 930 and 9951020 cm-1. With increasing calcination temperature, the intensity of the bands pertaining to anatase and ceria increases proportionately, whereas the broad bands around 930 and 9951020 cm-1 disappear progressively. At a calcination temperature of 873 K, a few new peaks could be seen at 234, 260, 372, 783, 795, and 857 cm-1. These are the characteristic bands of the CeVO4 phase.51 The intensity of these bands increases with increasing calcination temperature. According to literature reports, the TiO2 rutile phase (space group P42/mnm) exhibits bands at 144, 148, and 611 cm-1, whose presence could be seen at 1073 K with very weak bands, in agreement with XRD results.40 No strongly crystalline V2O5 features (Raman bands at 995, 702, 527, 404, 284, and 146 cm-1) are apparent, in line with the XRD observations. 49,50 Generally, the Raman bands of supported metal oxide catalysts in the range of 1050950 cm-1 are assigned to the stretching mode of the short terminal MO bonds, whereas the bands in the range of 950750 cm-1 are attributed to either the antisymmetric stretch of MOM bonds or the symmetric stretch of (OMO)n bonds.52,53 The presence of weak bands at 930 and 9951020 cm-1 in the case of 773973 K calcined samples can be assigned to the dispersed vanadia on the surface of the mixed-oxide support, whose presence could not be found at 1073 K. At higher calcination temperatures, the dispersed vanadia interacts with the ceria portion of the mixed oxide, leading to the formation of the CeVO4 stable compound. At low calcination temperatures, the impregnated vanadia is mostly in a highly dispersed state (polyvanadate) on the surface of CeO2TiO2. Similar findings were also reported by Banares and Wachs for dehydrated VOx/CeO2 catalysts.49,54 By employing in situ Raman spectroscopy, they demonstrated the disappearance of surface vanadium oxide species with the simultaneous formation of a bulk CeVO4 phase (Raman peaks at 840, 774, 768, 458, 369, 259, 215, and 146 cm-1) with increasing calcination temperature.54 Raman is particularly powerful in the identification of the structure of amorphous systems that cannot be discerned by diffraction studies. On the whole, Raman spectra corroborate well with the XRD results.
To understand the nature of interactions between the supported oxide and the supporting oxides, samples of CeO2TiO2 and 5% V2O5/CeO2TiO2 calcined at different temperatures have been investigated by XPS technique. The electron-binding energies (eV) of the photoelectron peaks pertaining to O 1s, Ti 2p, Ce 3d, and V 2p are shown in Table 2 and agree well with the values reported in the literature.31,32,55 The representative photoelectron peaks of O 1s and Ce 3d pertaining to both the CeO2TiO2 and 5% V2O5/CeO2TiO2 samples are depicted together in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. Figure 5 displays the O 1s XP spectra of CeO2TiO2 and 5% V2O5/CeO2TiO2 samples calcined at different temperatures. As shown in Figure 5, the O 1s peak is, in general, broad and complicated because of the nonequivalence of surface oxygen ions. The peak shape suggests that it is composed of more than one peak arising from the overlapping contribution of oxygen from ceria, titania, and amorphous CeTiO compounds in the case of the CeO2TiO2 support. The binding energy of the most intense O 1s peak slightly increased for the 1073 K calcined sample. Similarly, the O 1s profile of the V2O5/CeO2TiO2 sample is further complicated because of the overlapping contribution of oxygen from various component oxides. The broad peak (indicated by a dotted line in the Figure) on the higher binding-energy end can be attributed to the formation of the CeVO4 compound, usually observed around 532.9 eV.41 The Ti 2p photoemission spectra of the support exhibited (not shown) typical XPS peaks in the range of 458.7459.1 eV for Ti 2p3/2; these agree well with the values reported in the literature.20,21 The intensity of the Ti 2p core-level spectra increased with increasing calcination temperature because of better crystallization of TiO2. In the case of V2O5/CeO2TiO2 samples, the binding energy of the Ti 2p3/2 peak varied between 458.8 and 458.3 eV. These values are within the range reported in the literature for stoichiometric TiO2 surfaces.20,21,31,32 Hence, it can be inferred from XPS results that titanium is mostly confined to its highest oxidation state (IV).

The Ce 3d XP spectra of CeO2TiO2 and 5% V2O5/CeO2TiO2 samples calcined at different temperatures are shown in Figure 6. The XPS core-level spectra of Ce 3d are generally characterized by complex but distinct features that are related to the final-state occupation of the Ce 4f level.56 On the basis of the works of Burroughs et al.,57 Pfau and Schierbaum,55 and Creaser et al.,58 the Ce 3d spectrum can be assigned as follows: The peaks labeled u are due to 3d3/2 spinorbit states, and those labeled v are the corresponding 3d5/2 states. The u/v doublet is due to the primary photoemission from Ce(IV)O2. The u/v and u/v doublets are shakedown features resulting from the transfer of one or two electrons from a filled O 2p orbital to an empty Ce 4f orbital. The u/v doublet is due to photoemission from Ce (III) cations. The Ce 3d spectrum of the CeO2TiO2 sample basically denotes a mixture of Ce3+/Ce4+ oxidation states giving rise to a myriad of peaks indicating that the surface of the sample is not fully oxidized. With increasing calcination temperature, the intensity of the u/v doublet due to primary photoemission from Ce3+ relative to the intensities of the peaks due to photoemission from Ce4+ (u/v) increases gradually up to 873 K and then decreases. An additional less-resolved peak centered at 880.9 eV can be observed in the spectrum. This peak is a shakedown feature resulting from the transfer of one electron from a filled O 2p orbital to a Ce 4f orbital during photoemission from Ce3+ cations. This shakedown feature gives rise to an additional doublet, which is labeled as u0/v0 in the spectrum. The presence of u0/v0 and u/v doublet peaks in the spectrum indicates that the CeO2TiO2 sample contains some oxygen vacancies and is in a partially reduced state. Partial photoreduction of CeO2 during XPS measurements is a well-known fact in the literature. 59-61 The reduction is mainly due to the progressive elimination of surface hydroxyls and oxygen ions from the CeO2 surface upon vacuum treatment. The Ce 3d spectra of vanadia-impregnated samples are fairly similar to the spectra of the CeO2TiO2 support. With increasing calcination temperature, an increase in the intensity of the Ce3+ designated peaks is observed up to 973 K. This can be attributed primarily to the formation of the CeVO4 compound. The Ce 3d spectrum of the 1073 K calcined sample was poorly resolved, which could be due to the incorporation of titanium cations into the ceria lattice in addition to the formation of the CeVO4 compound.
The core-level spectra of V 2p (not shown) were observed to be broad in the case of V2O5/CeO2TiO2 samples, which could be due to the presence of multiple oxidation states or charge transfer between the active component and the support (metal oxidesupport oxide interaction). 62-64 However, the intensity of the spectra increased with increasing calcination temperature. The V 2p BE values as presented in Table 2 indicate that vanadium is predominantly in the V(V) oxidation state. The BE of V 2p3/2 reported for the V(V) oxidation state ranges between 517.4516.4 eV.62-64 The BE values as presented in Table 2 and an increase in the intensity with increasing calcination temperature support the formation of CeVO4, as observed from other techniques. Thus, the XPS results support the conclusions drawn from XRD and Raman results fairly well.
Conclusions
The CeO2TiO2 mixed oxide is thermally stable, retaining its component oxides from poorly crystalline to well-crystallized phases with increasing calcination temperature from 773 to 1073 K. The a cell-parameter values indicate some incorporation of titanium into the ceria lattice. However, no defined mixed phases could be observed from XRD and Raman studies. Impregnating vanadia on the CeO2TiO2 mixed oxide enhances the crystallization of CeO2 and TiO2 oxides. No crystalline V2O5 could be observed from XRD and RS measurements irrespective of the calcination temperature. Furthermore, Raman results reveal that the dispersed vanadium oxide is mostly in the form of polyvanadate species on the surface of CeO2TiO2 at lower calcination temperatures. The characterization results further suggest that the dispersed vanadium oxide interacts preferably with the ceria portion of the CeO2TiO2 mixed oxide and forms a stable CeVO4 compound at higher calcination temperatures. The XPS electron-binding energies indicate that CeO2TiO2 and V2O5/CeO2TiO2 samples calcined at 773 K mainly contain the mixed-oxide elements in their highest oxidation states, Ce(IV), Ti(IV), and V(V). The presence of Ce(III) has been noticed in both cases at all temperatures in different proportions. Additional studies are required to understand the mechanism of the solid-state reactions between the dispersed vanadium oxide and the CeO2TiO2 mixed-oxide support because these materials are very promising for various catalytic purposes. 65

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
