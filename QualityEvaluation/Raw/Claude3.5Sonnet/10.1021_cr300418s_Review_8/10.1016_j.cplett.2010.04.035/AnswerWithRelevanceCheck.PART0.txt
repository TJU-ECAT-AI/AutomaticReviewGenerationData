          [1] "We present density functional theory (DFT) studies of doping of the CeO2 (1 1 0) surface with +5 cations, Ta and Nb, as a route to formation of Ce3+."

[2] "With both methods we find formation of Ce3+ ions due to the extra electron from the dopant residing on a single Ce site, confirming the DFT + U description of these systems."

[3] "Doping with Nb and Ta activates the surface to NO2 reduction  there is no interaction with the undoped surface but the Ce3+ ion in the doped surface interacts strongly with NO2."

[4] "We are interested in systems in which Ce3+ can be produced by doping, as an alternative to oxygen vacancy formation."

[5] "Thus the vital factor in the reduction of NO2 is the presence of Ce3+ ions at the oxide surface and the ease with which such ions can be reoxidised through charge transfer to an adsorbate."

[6] "Substitutional cation doping of ceria with another species, such as Zr [1012], Ti [10], Au [6] and Cu [13], has been shown to reduce the energy required for formation of oxygen vacancies."

[7] "Doping of ceria with high oxidation state cations is a novel and potentially more controlled means of generating Ce3+ ions that are active for molecular reduction, as compared to oxygen vacancy formation."

[8] "Given the problems with using density functional theory (DFT) to study ceria, we apply two DFT approaches: DFT corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, DFT + U [18] and hybrid DFT, in the shape of the HSE06 functional [19]."

          The study primarily focuses on the effects of high-valence dopants (HVDs), specifically Ta and Nb (+5 cations), on the catalytic properties of CeO2. Key findings include:

1. HVDs like Ta and Nb in CeO2 lead to the formation of Ce3+ ions, which are crucial for catalytic activity, particularly in NO2 reduction.

2. Doping with Ta and Nb activates the CeO2 surface for NO2 reduction, whereas the undoped surface shows no interaction.

3. HVD doping provides a more controlled method of generating Ce3+ ions compared to oxygen vacancy formation.

4. The presence of Ce3+ ions facilitates charge transfer to adsorbates, which is key for catalytic reactions.

5. Computational methods (DFT+U and hybrid HSE06) can effectively model the effects of dopants on metal oxide surfaces.

Regarding same-valence dopants (SVDs), the study briefly mentions that substitutional cation doping with Zr, Ti, Au, and Cu has been shown to reduce the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation in ceria.

The research demonstrates the potential of computational studies in understanding dopant effects on catalytic properties. However, it does not provide comprehensive information about other metal oxides or directly address the challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior. Factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions are not explicitly discussed.

To develop general predictive rules for dopant behavior in catalysis, more extensive studies across various metal oxides and dopant types would be needed.

          这项研究主要关注高价态掺杂剂(HVDs)，特别是Ta和Nb（+5阳离子）对CeO2催化性能的影响。主要发现包括：

1. Ta和Nb等HVDs在CeO2中会导致Ce3+离子的形成，这对催化活性至关重要，特别是在NO2还原中。

2. 用Ta和Nb掺杂会激活CeO2表面进行NO2还原，而未掺杂的表面则不显示相互作用。

3. HVD掺杂提供了一种比氧空位形成更可控的Ce3+离子生成方法。

4. Ce3+离子的存在促进了电荷向吸附物的转移，这对催化反应至关重要。

5. 计算方法（DFT+U和混合HSE06）可以有效地模拟掺杂剂对金属氧化物表面的影响。

关于同价态掺杂剂(SVDs)，研究简要提到用Zr、Ti、Au和Cu进行替代阳离子掺杂已被证明可以降低二氧化铈中形成氧空位所需的能量。

这项研究展示了计算研究在理解掺杂剂对催化性能影响方面的潜力。然而，它没有提供关于其他金属氧化物的全面信息，也没有直接讨论制定掺杂剂行为通用预测规则的挑战。诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用等因素没有被明确讨论。

要制定掺杂剂行为在催化中的通用预测规则，还需要对各种金属氧化物和掺杂剂类型进行更广泛的研究。
