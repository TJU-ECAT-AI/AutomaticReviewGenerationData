[1] "We present density functional theory (DFT) studies of doping of the CeO2 (1 1 0) surface with +5 cations, Ta and Nb, as a route to formation of Ce3+."

[2] "With both methods we find formation of Ce3+ ions due to the extra electron from the dopant residing on a single Ce site, confirming the DFT + U description of these systems."

[3] "Doping with Nb and Ta activates the surface to NO2 reduction  there is no interaction with the undoped surface but the Ce3+ ion in the doped surface interacts strongly with NO2."

[4] "We are interested in systems in which Ce3+ can be produced by doping, as an alternative to oxygen vacancy formation."

[5] "Thus the vital factor in the reduction of NO2 is the presence of Ce3+ ions at the oxide surface and the ease with which such ions can be reoxidised through charge transfer to an adsorbate."

This study focuses specifically on high-valence dopants (HVDs) rather than same-valence dopants (SVDs) in ceria. The research shows that doping CeO2 with +5 cations like Ta and Nb leads to the formation of Ce3+ ions, which activates the surface for NO2 reduction. This is in contrast to the undoped surface, which does not interact with NO2.

The computational studies using DFT+U and hybrid DFT methods provide insights into the mechanism of Ce3+ formation through doping. They demonstrate that the extra electron from the +5 dopant resides on a single Ce site, creating a Ce3+ ion. This offers an alternative method to generate Ce3+ ions compared to oxygen vacancy formation.

The presence of Ce3+ ions is crucial for the catalytic reduction of NO2. The study shows that these ions can easily transfer charge to the adsorbate (NO2), which is the first step in its dissociation to NO and oxygen. This mechanism explains the enhanced catalytic activity of the doped surface.

While this study provides valuable insights into the behavior of HVDs in ceria for NO2 reduction, it does not discuss SVDs or other metal oxides. The research is focused on a specific system and application, so it does not address broader challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior across different oxides and applications. Factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions are not explicitly discussed in this context.

The study demonstrates the importance of computational methods in understanding dopant effects on catalytic properties. However, it also highlights the complexity of these systems, as the specific lattice site of the Ce3+ ion depends on the structural distortions caused by different dopants.

这项研究特别关注氧化铈中的高价态掺杂剂(HVDs)，而不是同价态掺杂剂(SVDs)。研究表明，用Ta和Nb等+5阳离子掺杂CeO2会导致Ce3+离子的形成，这激活了表面进行NO2还原。这与未掺杂的表面不与NO2相互作用形成对比。

使用DFT+U和混合DFT方法的计算研究提供了通过掺杂形成Ce3+的机理洞察。它们证明了+5掺杂剂的额外电子驻留在单个Ce位点上，创造了一个Ce3+离子。与氧空位形成相比，这提供了一种生成Ce3+离子的替代方法。

Ce3+离子的存在对NO2的催化还原至关重要。研究表明，这些离子可以容易地向吸附物(NO2)转移电荷，这是其解离为NO和氧气的第一步。这一机制解释了掺杂表面增强的催化活性。

虽然这项研究为NO2还原中氧化铈的HVDs行为提供了有价值的见解，但它并未讨论SVDs或其他金属氧化物。该研究集中于特定的系统和应用，因此没有涉及制定适用于不同氧化物和应用的掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的更广泛挑战。在这个背景下，没有明确讨论诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用等因素。

该研究展示了计算方法在理解掺杂剂对催化性能影响方面的重要性。然而，它也突出了这些系统的复杂性，因为Ce3+离子的特定晶格位置取决于不同掺杂剂引起的结构畸变。
