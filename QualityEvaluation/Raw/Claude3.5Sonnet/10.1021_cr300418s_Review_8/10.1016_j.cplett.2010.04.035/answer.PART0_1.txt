[1] "Substitutional cation doping of ceria with another species, such as Zr [1012], Ti [10], Au [6] and Cu [13], has been shown to reduce the energy required for formation of oxygen vacancies."

[2] "We are interested in systems in which Ce3+ can be produced by doping, as an alternative to oxygen vacancy formation."

[3] "We use DFT + U (U = 5 eV [3]) and HSE06 to study the Ta and Nb doped (1 1 0) surface and show that DFT + U provides a consistent description of the resulting Ce3+ defect, with one Ce3+ ion being formed."

[4] "Thus DFT + U and HSE06 give similar structural changes upon doping of the ceria surface with Ta and Nb."

[5] "Doping of ceria with high oxidation state cations is a novel and potentially more controlled means of generating Ce3+ ions that are active for molecular reduction, as compared to oxygen vacancy formation."

The literature provides several insights into the effects of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly ceria (CeO2):

1. SVDs like Zr, Ti, Au, and Cu in ceria have been shown to reduce the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, which is crucial for many catalytic applications.

2. HVDs like Ta and Nb (+5 cations) can produce Ce3+ ions through doping, offering an alternative to oxygen vacancy formation for generating catalytically active sites.

3. Both DFT+U and hybrid HSE06 computational methods consistently show the formation of one Ce3+ ion when doping ceria with Ta or Nb, demonstrating the reliability of these computational approaches.

4. HVD doping with Ta and Nb is described as a more controlled method of generating Ce3+ ions compared to oxygen vacancy formation, potentially allowing for better tuning of catalytic properties.

The study focuses primarily on ceria and does not provide comprehensive information about other metal oxides. Additionally, it does not directly address the challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior or factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions.

The research demonstrates the potential of computational studies in understanding dopant effects on catalytic properties. However, more extensive studies across various metal oxides and dopant types would be needed to develop general predictive rules for dopant behavior in catalysis.

该文献对同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物催化性能的影响提供了几个见解，特别是对二氧化铈（CeO2）的影响：

1. 在二氧化铈中，像Zr、Ti、Au和Cu这样的SVDs已被证明可以降低形成氧空位所需的能量，这对许多催化应用至关重要。

2. 像Ta和Nb这样的HVDs（+5阳离子）可以通过掺杂产生Ce3+离子，为生成催化活性位点提供了一种替代氧空位形成的方法。

3. DFT+U和混合HSE06计算方法一致地显示，当用Ta或Nb掺杂二氧化铈时会形成一个Ce3+离子，证明了这些计算方法的可靠性。

4. 用Ta和Nb进行HVD掺杂被描述为一种比氧空位形成更可控的Ce3+离子生成方法，可能允许更好地调节催化性能。

该研究主要集中在二氧化铈上，没有提供关于其他金属氧化物的全面信息。此外，它也没有直接讨论制定掺杂剂行为通用预测规则的挑战，或诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用等因素。

这项研究展示了计算研究在理解掺杂剂对催化性能影响方面的潜力。然而，要制定掺杂剂行为在催化中的通用预测规则，还需要对各种金属氧化物和掺杂剂类型进行更广泛的研究。
