[1] "We are interested in systems in which Ce3+ can be produced by doping, as an alternative to oxygen vacancy formation."

[2] "Given the problems with using density functional theory (DFT) to study ceria, we apply two DFT approaches: DFT corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, DFT + U [18] and hybrid DFT, in the shape of the HSE06 functional [19]."

[3] "We use DFT + U (U = 5 eV [3]) and HSE06 to study the Ta and Nb doped (1 1 0) surface and show that DFT + U provides a consistent description of the resulting Ce3+ defect, with one Ce3+ ion being formed."

[4] "Since the dopants have a formal +5 oxidation state, the ionic picture says that four of the electrons will be donated to oxygen, with one electron left to be accommodated. In fact, this question is similar to the case of Ta and Nb doped TiO2, in which DFT + U calculations show formation of a localised Ti3+ [17]."

[5] "Doping of ceria with high oxidation state cations is a novel and potentially more controlled means of generating Ce3+ ions that are active for molecular reduction, as compared to oxygen vacancy formation."

The literature provides insights into the effects of high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly cerium dioxide (CeO2). The study focuses on doping CeO2 with +5 cations, specifically tantalum (Ta) and niobium (Nb), as an alternative method to generate Ce3+ ions without creating oxygen vacancies.

Computational studies using density functional theory (DFT) approaches, including DFT+U and hybrid DFT (HSE06), demonstrate that doping CeO2 with Ta and Nb results in the formation of Ce3+ ions. This is similar to the case of Ta and Nb doped TiO2, where DFT+U calculations show the formation of localized Ti3+.

The presence of Ce3+ ions is crucial for activating NO2, which is a key step in NOx reduction. The study shows that NO2 adsorbs strongly at the doped surfaces, with the Ce3+ ion transferring charge to the molecule, weakening one NO bond and initiating dissociation to NO and oxygen.

HVDs like Ta and Nb offer a more controlled means of introducing Ce3+ ions compared to oxygen vacancy formation, with one Ce3+ ion formed for each +5 dopant. This approach potentially allows for better control over the catalytic properties of the material.

However, the study does not provide comparative information on same-valence dopants (SVDs) or discuss challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior. The focus is primarily on the specific case of Ta and Nb doping in CeO2 and its effects on NO2 reduction.

这篇文献提供了高价态掺杂剂(HVDs)对金属氧化物催化性能影响的见解,特别是对二氧化铈(CeO2)的影响。该研究主要关注用+5价阳离子,特别是钽(Ta)和铌(Nb)掺杂CeO2,作为一种不产生氧空位而生成Ce3+离子的替代方法。

使用密度泛函理论(DFT)方法的计算研究,包括DFT+U和杂化DFT(HSE06),证明了用Ta和Nb掺杂CeO2会导致Ce3+离子的形成。这与Ta和Nb掺杂TiO2的情况类似,其中DFT+U计算显示了局部Ti3+的形成。

Ce3+离子的存在对于活化NO2至关重要,这是NOx还原的关键步骤。研究表明,NO2在掺杂表面上强烈吸附,Ce3+离子向分子转移电荷,削弱了一个NO键,并开始解离成NO和氧。

像Ta和Nb这样的HVDs提供了一种比氧空位形成更可控的引入Ce3+离子的方法,每个+5价掺杂剂形成一个Ce3+离子。这种方法可能允许更好地控制材料的催化性能。

然而,该研究没有提供关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)的比较信息,也没有讨论制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战。研究主要集中在Ta和Nb掺杂CeO2的特定情况及其对NO2还原的影响。
