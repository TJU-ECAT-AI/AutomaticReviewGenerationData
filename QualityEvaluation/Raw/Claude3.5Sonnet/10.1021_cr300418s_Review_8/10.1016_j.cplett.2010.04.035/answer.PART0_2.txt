[1] "We present density functional theory (DFT) studies of doping of the CeO2 (1 1 0) surface with +5 cations, Ta and Nb, as a route to formation of Ce3+."

[2] "With both methods we find formation of Ce3+ ions due to the extra electron from the dopant residing on a single Ce site, confirming the DFT + U description of these systems."

[3] "Doping with Nb and Ta activates the surface to NO2 reduction  there is no interaction with the undoped surface but the Ce3+ ion in the doped surface interacts strongly with NO2."

[4] "We are interested in systems in which Ce3+ can be produced by doping, as an alternative to oxygen vacancy formation."

[5] "Thus the vital factor in the reduction of NO2 is the presence of Ce3+ ions at the oxide surface and the ease with which such ions can be reoxidised through charge transfer to an adsorbate. Doping of ceria with high oxidation state cations is a novel and potentially more controlled means of generating Ce3+ ions that are active for molecular reduction, as compared to oxygen vacancy formation."

The literature primarily focuses on high-valence dopants (HVDs), specifically Ta and Nb (+5 cations), in CeO2. It does not directly compare same-valence dopants (SVDs) and HVDs across different metal oxides. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. HVDs like Ta and Nb in CeO2 lead to the formation of Ce3+ ions, which are crucial for catalytic activity.

2. Doping with Ta and Nb activates the CeO2 surface for NO2 reduction, whereas the undoped surface shows no interaction.

3. HVD doping provides a more controlled method of generating Ce3+ ions compared to oxygen vacancy formation.

4. The study demonstrates that computational methods (DFT+U and hybrid HSE06) can effectively model the effects of dopants on metal oxide surfaces.

5. The research highlights the importance of Ce3+ ions in facilitating charge transfer to adsorbates, which is key for catalytic reactions.

The study does not address challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior or factors like Lewis acid-base interactions. It also doesn't compare reducible and irreducible oxides. More comprehensive studies across various metal oxides and dopant types would be needed to develop general predictive rules.

这篇文献主要关注CeO2中的高价态掺杂剂(HVDs)，特别是Ta和Nb（+5阳离子）。它并没有直接比较不同金属氧化物中的同价态掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价态掺杂剂(HVDs)。然而，我们可以得出一些见解：

1. Ta和Nb等HVDs在CeO2中会导致Ce3+离子的形成，这对催化活性至关重要。

2. 用Ta和Nb掺杂会激活CeO2表面进行NO2还原，而未掺杂的表面则不显示相互作用。

3. HVD掺杂提供了一种比氧空位形成更可控的Ce3+离子生成方法。

4. 该研究表明，计算方法（DFT+U和混合HSE06）可以有效地模拟掺杂剂对金属氧化物表面的影响。

5. 研究强调了Ce3+离子在促进电荷向吸附物转移方面的重要性，这对催化反应至关重要。

这项研究没有讨论制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战，也没有涉及Lewis酸碱相互作用等因素。它也没有比较可还原和不可还原的氧化物。要制定一般性的预测规则，需要对各种金属氧化物和掺杂剂类型进行更全面的研究。
