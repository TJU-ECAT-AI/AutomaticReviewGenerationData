[1] "We are interested in systems in which Ce3+ can be produced by doping, as an alternative to oxygen vacancy formation."

[2] "Given the problems with using density functional theory (DFT) to study ceria, we apply two DFT approaches: DFT corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, DFT + U [18] and hybrid DFT, in the shape of the HSE06 functional [19]."

[3] "We use DFT + U (U = 5 eV [3]) and HSE06 to study the Ta and Nb doped (1 1 0) surface and show that DFT + U provides a consistent description of the resulting Ce3+ defect, with one Ce3+ ion being formed."

[4] "Since the dopants have a formal +5 oxidation state, the ionic picture says that four of the electrons will be donated to oxygen, with one electron left to be accommodated. In fact, this question is similar to the case of Ta and Nb doped TiO2, in which DFT + U calculations show formation of a localised Ti3+ [17]."

[5] "Doping of ceria with high oxidation state cations is a novel and potentially more controlled means of generating Ce3+ ions that are active for molecular reduction, as compared to oxygen vacancy formation."

The literature provides insights into the effects of high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly cerium dioxide (CeO2). The study focuses on doping CeO2 with +5 cations, specifically tantalum (Ta) and niobium (Nb), as an alternative method to generate Ce3+ ions without creating oxygen vacancies.

Computational studies using density functional theory (DFT) approaches, including DFT+U and hybrid DFT (HSE06), demonstrate that doping CeO2 with Ta and Nb results in the formation of Ce3+ ions. This is similar to the case of Ta and Nb doped TiO2, where DFT+U calculations show the formation of localized Ti3+.

The presence of Ce3+ ions is crucial for activating NO2, which is a key step in NOx reduction. The study shows that NO2 adsorbs strongly at the doped surfaces, with the Ce3+ ion transferring charge to the molecule, weakening one NO bond and initiating dissociation to NO and oxygen.

HVDs like Ta and Nb offer a more controlled means of introducing Ce3+ ions compared to oxygen vacancy formation, with one Ce3+ ion formed for each +5 dopant. This approach potentially allows for better control over the catalytic properties of the material.

However, the study does not provide comparative information on same-valence dopants (SVDs) or discuss challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior. The focus is primarily on the specific case of Ta and Nb doping in CeO2 and its effects on NO2 reduction.

这篇文献提供了高价态掺杂剂(HVDs)对金属氧化物催化性能影响的见解,特别是对二氧化铈(CeO2)的影响。该研究主要关注用+5价阳离子,特别是钽(Ta)和铌(Nb)掺杂CeO2,作为一种不产生氧空位而生成Ce3+离子的替代方法。

使用密度泛函理论(DFT)方法的计算研究,包括DFT+U和杂化DFT(HSE06),证明了用Ta和Nb掺杂CeO2会导致Ce3+离子的形成。这与Ta和Nb掺杂TiO2的情况类似,其中DFT+U计算显示了局部Ti3+的形成。

Ce3+离子的存在对于活化NO2至关重要,这是NOx还原的关键步骤。研究表明,NO2在掺杂表面上强烈吸附,Ce3+离子向分子转移电荷,削弱了一个NO键,并开始解离成NO和氧。

像Ta和Nb这样的HVDs提供了一种比氧空位形成更可控的引入Ce3+离子的方法,每个+5价掺杂剂形成一个Ce3+离子。这种方法可能允许更好地控制材料的催化性能。

然而,该研究没有提供关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)的比较信息,也没有讨论制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战。研究主要集中在Ta和Nb掺杂CeO2的特定情况及其对NO2还原的影响。

[2] "We are interested in systems in which Ce3+ can be produced by doping, as an alternative to oxygen vacancy formation."

The literature provides several insights into the effects of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly ceria (CeO2):

1. SVDs like Zr, Ti, Au, and Cu in ceria have been shown to reduce the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, which is crucial for many catalytic applications.

2. HVDs like Ta and Nb (+5 cations) can produce Ce3+ ions through doping, offering an alternative to oxygen vacancy formation for generating catalytically active sites.

3. Both DFT+U and hybrid HSE06 computational methods consistently show the formation of one Ce3+ ion when doping ceria with Ta or Nb, demonstrating the reliability of these computational approaches.

4. HVD doping with Ta and Nb is described as a more controlled method of generating Ce3+ ions compared to oxygen vacancy formation, potentially allowing for better tuning of catalytic properties.

The study focuses primarily on ceria and does not provide comprehensive information about other metal oxides. Additionally, it does not directly address the challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior or factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions.

The research demonstrates the potential of computational studies in understanding dopant effects on catalytic properties. However, more extensive studies across various metal oxides and dopant types would be needed to develop general predictive rules for dopant behavior in catalysis.

The literature primarily focuses on high-valence dopants (HVDs), specifically Ta and Nb (+5 cations), in CeO2. It does not directly compare same-valence dopants (SVDs) and HVDs across different metal oxides. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. HVDs like Ta and Nb in CeO2 lead to the formation of Ce3+ ions, which are crucial for catalytic activity.

2. Doping with Ta and Nb activates the CeO2 surface for NO2 reduction, whereas the undoped surface shows no interaction.

3. HVD doping provides a more controlled method of generating Ce3+ ions compared to oxygen vacancy formation.

4. The study demonstrates that computational methods (DFT+U and hybrid HSE06) can effectively model the effects of dopants on metal oxide surfaces.

5. The research highlights the importance of Ce3+ ions in facilitating charge transfer to adsorbates, which is key for catalytic reactions.

The study does not address challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior or factors like Lewis acid-base interactions. It also doesn't compare reducible and irreducible oxides. More comprehensive studies across various metal oxides and dopant types would be needed to develop general predictive rules.

The literature provides insights into how high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of ceria (CeO2), a reducible metal oxide. Specifically:

1. Doping CeO2 with +5 cations like Ta and Nb leads to the formation of Ce3+ ions, which are crucial for catalytic activity.

2. The extra electron from the high-valence dopant resides on a single Ce site, creating a Ce3+ ion without the need for oxygen vacancy formation.

3. The presence of Ce3+ ions activates the CeO2 surface for NO2 reduction, whereas the undoped surface shows no interaction with NO2.

4. Ce3+ ions formed by doping can easily transfer charge to adsorbates, facilitating the reduction of molecules like NO2.

5. This doping strategy offers a more controlled method of introducing Ce3+ ions compared to oxygen vacancy formation.

The study does not directly compare same-valence dopants (SVDs) to HVDs, nor does it discuss other metal oxides or provide general predictive rules for dopant behavior. It focuses specifically on the effects of Ta and Nb doping in CeO2 for NO2 reduction.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior are not explicitly addressed in this literature. The study demonstrates the importance of considering the reducibility of the host oxide (CeO2 in this case) and the charge transfer capabilities of the dopant-induced Ce3+ ions. However, it does not discuss Lewis acid-base interactions or provide a broader framework for predicting dopant effects across different metal oxides.

该文献提供了关于高价态掺杂剂（HVDs）如何影响可还原金属氧化物二氧化铈（CeO2）的催化性能的见解。具体来说：

1. 用Ta和Nb等+5阳离子掺杂CeO2会导致Ce3+离子的形成，这对催化活性至关重要。

2. 来自高价态掺杂剂的额外电子停留在单个Ce位点上，创造了Ce3+离子，而无需形成氧空位。

3. Ce3+离子的存在激活了CeO2表面进行NO2还原，而未掺杂的表面与NO2没有相互作用。

4. 通过掺杂形成的Ce3+离子可以容易地将电荷转移给吸附物，促进了NO2等分子的还原。

5. 这种掺杂策略提供了一种比氧空位形成更可控的引入Ce3+离子的方法。

该研究没有直接比较同价态掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价态掺杂剂（HVDs），也没有讨论其他金属氧化物或提供掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则。它专注于研究Ta和Nb掺杂对CeO2中NO2还原的影响。

这篇文献没有明确讨论制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战。该研究展示了考虑宿主氧化物（本例中为CeO2）的可还原性以及掺杂诱导的Ce3+离子的电荷转移能力的重要性。然而，它没有讨论路易斯酸碱相互作用，也没有提供一个更广泛的框架来预测不同金属氧化物中的掺杂剂效应。

This study focuses specifically on high-valence dopants (HVDs) rather than same-valence dopants (SVDs) in ceria. The research shows that doping CeO2 with +5 cations like Ta and Nb leads to the formation of Ce3+ ions, which activates the surface for NO2 reduction. This is in contrast to the undoped surface, which does not interact with NO2.

The computational studies using DFT+U and hybrid DFT methods provide insights into the mechanism of Ce3+ formation through doping. They demonstrate that the extra electron from the +5 dopant resides on a single Ce site, creating a Ce3+ ion. This offers an alternative method to generate Ce3+ ions compared to oxygen vacancy formation.

The presence of Ce3+ ions is crucial for the catalytic reduction of NO2. The study shows that these ions can easily transfer charge to the adsorbate (NO2), which is the first step in its dissociation to NO and oxygen. This mechanism explains the enhanced catalytic activity of the doped surface.

While this study provides valuable insights into the behavior of HVDs in ceria for NO2 reduction, it does not discuss SVDs or other metal oxides. The research is focused on a specific system and application, so it does not address broader challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior across different oxides and applications. Factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions are not explicitly discussed in this context.

The study demonstrates the importance of computational methods in understanding dopant effects on catalytic properties. However, it also highlights the complexity of these systems, as the specific lattice site of the Ce3+ ion depends on the structural distortions caused by different dopants.

这项研究特别关注氧化铈中的高价态掺杂剂(HVDs)，而不是同价态掺杂剂(SVDs)。研究表明，用Ta和Nb等+5阳离子掺杂CeO2会导致Ce3+离子的形成，这激活了表面进行NO2还原。这与未掺杂的表面不与NO2相互作用形成对比。

使用DFT+U和混合DFT方法的计算研究提供了通过掺杂形成Ce3+的机理洞察。它们证明了+5掺杂剂的额外电子驻留在单个Ce位点上，创造了一个Ce3+离子。与氧空位形成相比，这提供了一种生成Ce3+离子的替代方法。

Ce3+离子的存在对NO2的催化还原至关重要。研究表明，这些离子可以容易地向吸附物(NO2)转移电荷，这是其解离为NO和氧气的第一步。这一机制解释了掺杂表面增强的催化活性。

虽然这项研究为NO2还原中氧化铈的HVDs行为提供了有价值的见解，但它并未讨论SVDs或其他金属氧化物。该研究集中于特定的系统和应用，因此没有涉及制定适用于不同氧化物和应用的掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的更广泛挑战。在这个背景下，没有明确讨论诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用等因素。

该研究展示了计算方法在理解掺杂剂对催化性能影响方面的重要性。然而，它也突出了这些系统的复杂性，因为Ce3+离子的特定晶格位置取决于不同掺杂剂引起的结构畸变。
