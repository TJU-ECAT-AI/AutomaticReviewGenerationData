Nanostructured CeO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides have attracted great interest in the past 10 years, in
particular as redox or oxygen storage promoters in the three-way catalysts. However, it has now
became clear that both the chemistry of the simple oxides and the complex metal–CeO2-based
oxide interactions can play a critical role in developing novel and highly active materials for a
number of processes, ranging from catalysts for H2 production from fuels up to ceramic materials
and solid state conductors for fuel cells. Despite the apparent simplicity of these systems, extreme
variability of their chemical and textural properties has been observed. An attempt is made here to
rationalise the various factors and the inter-connections to the structure, the texture, and the
effects of the nanometre scale, which all contribute to the properties of these materials.
1. Introduction
CeO2- and ZrO2-containing materials have attracted much
interest in recent years due to their extensive use in very
different fields, ranging from catalysis1–6 to ceramics,7 fuel cell
technologies,8–11 gas sensors,12–15 solid state electrolytes,16
chromatographic materials,17–19 ceramic biomaterials,20 cos-
metics,21,22 etc., in addition to the classical application of CeO2
as a glass polishing agent.1 However, the most relevant use of
CeO2-based compounds is in automotive pollution control, as
promoters of the so-called three-way catalyst (TWC). Virtually
all vehicles are nowadays equipped with catalytic converters,
which invariably contain some CeO2-containing oxide as
catalyst promoter, mainly doped CeO2–ZrO2 materials. This
wide use of these systems as catalyst components prompted a
renewed interest with regards to these materials in the form of
nanosized, high surface area powders. We therefore address
the issues related to the catalytic use of such materials, by
considering specifically the targets for the synthesis and
characterisation of these apparently very simple systems in
the form of nanosized particles. The possibility of producing
redox nanomaterials with tuneable redox capability to activate
simple
reactants
has
recently
been
discussed.23
Nano-
structuring the materials to provide novel properties appears
as a cutting edge frontier in designing catalysts and catalyst
promoters for specific catalytic reactions.
The present paper is focused on CexZr12xO2 solid solutions
and organised as follows: first, the structural and phase
homogeneity
are
analysed,
then
textural
properties
are
discussed. Some correlations between these parameters and
chemical behaviour are traced. Attempts are made to give a
rationale of aspects concerning the structural and chemical
properties at the core of the intriguing properties of this
system. It is important to notice that despite 50 years of
investigations,24–36
there
are
still
disagreements
on
the
phase diagram itself and its phase boundaries,3,37 besides
problems related to structural aspects38 and chemical (redox)
behaviour.23

2. Structural properties of CeO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides
2.1. Phase diagram and phase homogeneity
Due to the wide interest in ZrO2-containing materials,
particularly in the field of ceramics, structural properties and
the phase diagram of CeO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides have attracted
interest for more than half a century.24–34,36,39–44 However,
despite the apparent simplicity of the system, both the phase
diagram and structural properties of the CeO2–ZrO2 system
are still a matter of investigation. This is due to the fact that
given the relatively large misfit between the Zr(IV) and Ce(IV)
ionic radii (0.084 vs. 0.097 nm) and the different structures at
room temperature (RT) of the parent oxides (ZrO2: mono-
clinic, space group P21/c and CeO2: cubic-fluorite type, space
group Fm3
¯m),45 formation of a thermodynamically stable solid
solution is not favoured over the whole range of composi-
tions.46 Yashima et al.31,47,48 categorised the tetragonal phases
into t, t9 and t0 phases, according to the type of the tetragonal
distortion (ratio of cell parameters c/a 5 1.02, 1.001–1.02 and
1 respectively) and its nature, i.e. t-phase which is stable, and
t9, t0 which are metastable. In addition to these phases, a cubic
phase is observed for CeO2 contents above 80 mol% and a
monoclinic below ca. 10 mol%. All the tetragonal phases were
indexed in the P42/nmc space group. Recently, two new phases,
designated k and t* have been reported and characterized for
the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 composition. These phases are generated by
controlled re-oxidation of pyrochlore Ce2Zr2O7+y and differ in
the cation ordering.49–52 The possibility of these oxides
undergoing a relatively facile reduction makes exact definition
of the phase diagram challenging because reduced phases
should be taken into account, as they may be formed at high
temperatures even under oxidising conditions.25 Furthermore,
it has now become clearly evident that, due to the metastability
of these systems, the processing of the sample, i.e. temperature
and extent of reduction and oxidation that have been
applied to the mixed oxide precursor, plays a key role in
leading to systems possessing different structural and chemical
properties.40,51,53–58
The metastability of the t9 and t0 phases, which exist in the
range of CeO2 content 20–80 mol%, has represented a real
challenge for the characterisation of these materials, particu-
larly those employed in catalytic applications. Even if redox
properties, which are the most important ones in catalytic
applications,
may
concern
the
bulk
even
at
moderate
temperatures,59,60 a high surface area of the products is a
necessary requisite in this case, to maximise the gas–solid
contact under catalytic conditions. This adds complexity to the
characterisation of these mixed oxides since: (i) the XRD
patterns are broadened due to low particle size of such high
surface area product, not allowing a proper assessment of the
presence of a single phase; and (ii) when the material is
calcined at high temperatures to induce its partial sintering and
hence sharpening of the XRD profiles, phase segregation may
be observed for compositions where the metastable phases are
formed (20 mol% , CeO2 , 80 mol%).61,62 In fact, the thermal
‘‘stability’’ of the metastable phases in high surface area
samples depends on several factors (compare ref. 37 and
references therein); the small particle size being a critical one.
Consistently, Colon et al. found that above a certain critical
particle size (,20 nm) the metastable CexZr12xO2 (x 5 0.50
and
0.68)
mixed
oxides
of
the
t0-symmetry
phase
segregated into thermodynamically stable t-Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 and
c-Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 products.62 As shown below, the assessment of
the presence or not of a solid solution is an important aspect of
the characterisation of these systems due to the fact that their
redox behaviour has been shown to depend on several factors,
including structure,60 texture,63,64 phase homogeneity65 and
even pre-treatment.51,56,57,66 The phase homogeneity generally
plays an important role as lack of incorporation of CeO2 into
the solid solution generally leads to reduction peaks at high
temperatures,3 whereas reduction at low temperature is
considered a favourable property.23 A possible interpretation
of such variability of the chemical behaviour may be that, due
to limited solubility of ZrO2 in the CeO2 lattice, the metastable
phases and the domain-type structures, which may be formed
at a nanoscale level in the synthesis, cannot easily be detected
by conventional characterisation methods.67 The failure of
detecting such nanosized non-homogeneities results in the
comparison of different materials with nominally equal composi-
tion. Accordingly, we have addressed the synthesis of the
CeO2–ZrO2 mixed oxide materials in detail, with the aim of
developing a simple, reliable and easily available criterion
which would allow the presence of a ‘‘homogeneous’’ solid
solution to be discriminated.58,65,68,69
The importance of this issue is clearly highlighted by a
detailed study, jointly reported by researchers from Ford and
Rhodia,70 on the effects of thermal and redox ageing on the
oxygen storage and release (OSC) property of four different
Ce0.7Zr0.3O2 samples prepared by different proprietary routes.
Very importantly, even if all four samples were found to be
equivalent in light of conventional characterisation techniques
(XRD, XPS), they featured significantly different redox
properties after ageing, suggesting that subtle (hardly detect-
able by conventional techniques) differences did exist in their
samples.
An example of the difficulties, which can be encountered
when the sample homogeneity is to be assessed, is shown in
Fig. 1: symmetrical line profiles are observed for the (111)
reflection in the pseudo-cubic symmetry of both the products
prepared by a slightly modified procedure and calcined at
773 K, which could suggest that formation of a homogeneous
solid solution has been achieved in both syntheses. There is a
shift of the (111) reflection from 28.6u 2h observed for CeO2 to
29.1u 2h observed for the Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 mixed oxides, which
further supports such incorporation of ZrO2 into the CeO2
lattice. A decrease of lattice parameter with ZrO2 incorpora-
tion is dictated by the Vegard rule, due to the smaller Zr(IV)
ionic radius compared to that of Ce(IV). On increasing the
calcination temperature segregation of a CeO2-rich phase is
observed in Fig. 1A (non optimised synthesis), which appears
well in line with the above considerations on the thermo-
dynamic stability of these materials. In contrast, using
optimised synthesis conditions,68 quite different results were
obtained (Fig. 1B), since no evidence for phase segregation
could be achieved even after calcination at 1273 K for 5 h. The
presence of the single-phase product to the sensitivity of this
methodology was assessed by Rietveld profile fitting of the
XRD patterns (Fig. 1C).68 Remarkably, comparable results

were obtained on a Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 sample;5,68 this composition is
expected from the phase diagram to be the most easily
segregated. A rationale for the data shown in Fig. 1 is that the
use of optimised synthesis conditions leads to a statistical
distribution of the Ce and Zr cations in the lattice of the mixed
oxides with negligible local enrichments in one or the other
phase. Such a situation makes the process of phase segregation
slow. On the contrary, when a non-homogeneous cation
distribution is achieved, induced by an inadequate synthesis
methodology, the ZrO2- and/or CeO2-rich nanodomains thus
formed act as nuclei for the segregation of the thermodyna-
mically stable phases, speeding up the kinetics of the process.
Consistent with this interpretation when the calcination
temperature was increased up to 1373 K, fast and complete
phase segregation occurred, as dictated by the phase diagram.
It is important to notice that the present phase homogeneity
criterion
has
been
successfully
applied
in
the
authors’
laboratory to samples prepared by a number of different
synthesis routes, indicating that, even if it is an ‘‘irreversible’’
type of analysis,72 i.e. leading to irreversible sample modifica-
tion, it can be widely applied to samples of different origin.
Accordingly, the important output of these observations is
the fact that the calcination at 1273 K for 5 h of CexZr12xO2
followed by an appropriate XRD analysis provided for the
first time65 a rapid and accessible criterion for definition of
phase purity in these materials and hence an indication of the
efficiency and adequacy of the synthesis methodology. It is
important to underline that the choice of the calcination
temperature (1273 K) and time (5 h) is critical since lower
calcination temperatures do not allow fine non-homogeneities
to be revealed.
We wish to stress at this point that detection of such ‘‘single
phase product’’ does not exclude the presence of nanodomains
of CeO2- and ZrO2-rich phases that may be undetectable by
conventional XRD technique, which analyses the sample on a
‘‘long range’’ scale. In fact, Mamontov et al. recently reported
Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 samples that appeared as a single-phase product
using conventional Rietveld profile fitting. However, when a
pair-distribution
function
(PDF)
structural
analysis
was
applied to the XRD patterns, the results indicated the presence
of 2.5–3.0 nm-wide nanodomains with respectively short
and long lattice parameters within the crystallite domain
(10–16 nm).73 This observation suggested an intrinsic non-
homogeneity of these materials, consisting of CeO2- and ZrO2-
rich nanodomains. Unfortunately, the authors calcined their
samples at 1073 K for 2 h. As discussed above, such a
low calcination temperature may not reveal sample non-
homogeneity induced by synthesis methodology.
Whereas a reliable criterion for detection of ‘‘bulk’’ type
(vide infra) non-homogeneities has been derived, much less
attention has been devoted to the issues of the surface
homogeneity of the CexZr12xO2 mixed oxides. In principle,
the XPS technique can profitably be employed to compare the
Ce/Zr ratios at the ‘‘surface’’ with those detected by bulk
analysis: thus comparable values were detected for surface and
bulk in a series of CexZr12xO2 samples prepared by Rhodia.74
However, it is important to note that the typical sampling
depth of this technique (2–5 nm) may be too high if compared
to the typical crystallite size of 5–7 nm of these nanodispersed
mixed oxides, even though very accurate analysis can provide
some
deeper
insight.75
Accordingly,
only
major
surface
segregation
phenomena
can
be
easily
detected
by
this
technique.76 Adsorption of probe molecules and their detec-
tion by spectroscopic techniques appears to be a more ‘‘surface
sensitive’’ technique in this context.72,74,77–83 Partners of an
EU research network have in the past dedicated strong efforts
in this direction,74,77–79 showing that methanol adsorption can
be successfully employed to detect surface composition.
Methanol dissociative adsorption is a very sensitive surface
tool capable of discriminating different adsorption sites and, in
particular, the band at 1150 cm21, attributed to an on-top
methoxy species adsorbed on Zr4+ site, was found to be highly
sensitive to the ZrO2 content of the mixed oxides, both in
terms of band intensity and its position, indicating that the
electronic properties of these surface sites changed con-
tinuously with sample composition.74 This is consistent with
the presence of a solid solution. Similarly, EPR characterisa-
tion of adsorbed oxygen species allowed discrimination of
different Zr and Ce adsorption sites at the surface.80,81
In a recent and accurate characterisation of two Ce0.5Zr0.5O2
samples
prepared
by
a
microemulsion
technique
using
different precursors, Martı
´nez-Arias et al.72 showed that both
samples presented similar characteristics after calcination at
773 K in light of XRD, Raman, XPS/Ar+ etching and TEM
techniques, detecting only a minor surface Ce enrichment with

respect to the bulk composition. However, EPR of adsorbed
superoxide species detected significant differences between the
two samples, evidencing the presence of small, more reducible
Ce-rich bidimensional patches disposed over a more Zr-rich
substrate in one of the two samples, suggesting surface
heterogeneity at a very short scale. No such phenomenon
was detected in the other sample. Only after calcination at
1173 K, the XPS/Ar+ etching profiles clearly revealed the
heterogeneous nature of one of the investigated samples;
curiously enough, the EPR technique was no longer able to
detect appreciable differences in these calcined samples, which
was attributed to the fact that changes had occurred on a
larger scale, where EPR is no longer sensitive. This clearly
outlines the extreme importance of the proper characterisation
methodology; combination of different techniques may be
necessary to adequately highlight fine details and subtle non-
homogeneities in these mixed oxides.
2.2.The Vegard rule and lattice parameters of the CexZr12xO2
nanoparticles
As explained above, despite the apparent extreme simplicity of
the CeO2–ZrO2 system and quite intensive research work, the
fine structural details of the CeO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides have not
been fully elucidated as yet. In fact, not only may the thermal
history of the sample generate different ordered structures but
even the structural analysis of Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 solid solutions, of
the same composition but different textural properties and
synthesis and that were (to the sensitivity of the above quoted
criterion) single phase products, revealed distinct structural
properties.71 Whereas cation order–disorder and lattice dis-
tortion can in principle be easily detected by conventional
X-ray analysis, such a technique does not allow accurate
detection of distortions of the oxygen sublattice and/or defects
in the structure due to the poor sensitivity of this technique to
the oxygen atoms in the presence of heavy Ce and Zr atoms.
Other techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, which is
sensitive both to M–O bond arrangement32 and lattice
defects,92 EXAFS,38,91 neutron diffraction,93,94 etc, need to
be employed to assess the structural details of these materials.
Since evidence for structure–property relationships has been
reported,55,60,73 it appears useful to attempt to rationalise these
aspects here.
Let us first recall that the Vegard rule has been extensively
employed to assess the presence of the solid solutions. To this
end several researchers have developed a number of empirical
models that could describe the variation of the lattice
parameter with composition.89,90,95 A survey of some early
data on CexZr12xO2 cell parameters is reported in Fig. 2,
which shows that there are significant differences in the
pseudo-cubic cell parameter{ between the CexZr12xO2 mate-
rials prepared for catalytic applications (HSA), i.e. high
surface area nanometre-sized particles, and those prepared
for ceramic applications (LSA), i.e. highly sintered material
with grains in a micron range. Further to be noticed is that a
lack of ZrO2 incorporation into the CeO2 lattice can be
deduced from the Vegard rule as shown by the deviation from
the linearity of the data shown as symbols ‘‘#’’ in Fig. 2; data
taken from ref. 85.
This difference in the lattice parameters between the two
types of materials is somewhat puzzling, as the presence of
solid solutions has been claimed in both systems. In fact, an
investigation
of
the
structure–property
relationships
in
Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 systems also revealed differences in the structural
properties between the ceramic type of material prepared by
high temperature (1873 K) solid state synthesis and that
prepared by a soft route, subjected to calcination at milder
temperatures (773–1273 K).71 In particular, modifications to
the oxygen sublattice were observed as a function of the
processing of the material that could account also for the
redox behaviour. Since the mobility of the oxygen atoms in
the lattice is a critical property for most of the applications of
these materials, both as ionic/electronic conductors and redox
catalysts, a deep insight into these fine structural details is
desirable. Two questions therefore arise: (1) why is there a
significant difference in the lattice parameters between the
HSA and LSA materials and (2) what perturbations to the
oxygen sub-lattice are induced by the formation of the solid
solution?
To shed some light on the first aspect, we have analysed
the effect of the crystallite size on the lattice parameter{ of
a homogeneous t-Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 solid solution and CeO2.
Variation of the crystallite size was achieved by progressively
increasing the calcination temperature of the precursor,
initially calcined at a mild temperature. Note that under the
calcination conditions here employed (573–1273 K) no phase
segregation is expected in the t-Ce0.2Zr0.8O2.32,96,97 Consistent
with the data reported in Fig. 2, there is a neat increase of the
lattice parameter as the crystallite size decreases for both
t-Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 and CeO2 (Fig. 3). In principle, on increasing
the calcination temperature, ceria segregation at the surface of

the mixed t-Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 oxide can be expected due to its
higher ionic radius and/or cerium reduction.98 However,
segregation of about 30 mol% of CeO2 would be necessary
to account for the observed shifts of the cell parameter as the
calcination temperature was increased from 773 to 1273 K. An
occurrence of such segregation should have been detected
either by XRD or Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, XPS
measurements performed on samples calcined at 773 and
1273 K showed only a minor surface Ce enrichment, ruling out
segregation of CeO2 or a CeO2-rich phase as the origin of this
shift of the cell parameter with calcination temperature. This
interpretation is further supported by the fact that a similar
shift of the cell parameter has been observed in pure CeO2
where no segregation can be expected. In fact, variation of the
CeO2 lattice parameter with particle size was attributed to the
generation of defects in the nanocrystalline materials.99–101
Formation of reduced Ce(III) species is suggested to occur
as the particle size decreases below 15 nm, approximately.
Actually, lattice relaxations have been observed in different
nanocrystalline materials,102–104 CeO2 included. For nano-
crystalline CeO2, Tsunekawa et al. suggested the co-existence
of a C-type cerium sesquioxide to take into account the
observed lattice expansion as the crystallite size decreased.99,101
However, the amount of oxygen vacancies that was estimated
from such a model, i.e. x 5 0.10 in CeO12x for crystallite sizes
of 6.7 nm, appears too large: negligible magnetic susceptibility
due to paramagnetic Ce3+ species was detected over nano-
crystalline high surface area CeO2.105 The observed expansion
of the CeO2 can be easily accounted for using the ion-packing
model developed by Yashima et al.,89,90 which shows that
about 1% of oxygen vacancies, i.e. 2% of Ce3+, can account for
the lattice parameter expansion found in a 6 nm CeO2 particle
compared to bulk CeO2.106,107
When such a calculation is applied to the lattice expansion
observed in the case of our Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 material, we find an
unexpected situation: because of the low content of CeO2, as
above mentioned, about 30 mol% of Ce3+ would be required in
the t-Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 with a particle size of 12 nm to account for
the observed lattice expansion, upon assumption that the
oxygen vacancies are associated with the smaller Zr(IV)
atom.108–111 This value is not consistent with the redox
properties of these mixed oxides, which indicate that nearly
all the ceria species are fully oxidised in the starting material.97
An alternative explanation is therefore needed. Palosz et al.
noticed that the assumption of the infinite crystal lattice with
respect to the representative structural unit (unit cell) is not
justified for small nanosized particles, which can lead to
significant changes of the diffraction patterns.112,113 Con-
sistently, profile fitting of XRD patterns of nanocrystalline
materials presents several challenges, in addition to instru-
mental problems that may arise when nanocrystalline mate-
rials are analysed.114–116
For a spherical 12 nm-size Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 particle, the surface
layer, chosen one unit cell thick (pseudo-cubic cell), accounts
for about 25% of the Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 units present. The infinite
crystal lattice length is clearly not satisfied in this surface layer,
which may be considered as an another phase (Fig. 4)
contributing to the overall XRD pattern.112,113 A simplified
picture (instrumental limitations and other factors, however,
should also be taken into account, see refs. 112–116) is that
according to the surface strain, this layer can be either
expanded or compressed, leading to an ‘‘apparent lattice
parameter’’, which is measured experimentally as lattice
relaxation/compression of the nanocrystalline material with
respect to the bulk, microcrystalline, material.
There are implications deriving from these considerations
related to the application of the Vegard rule in CexZr12xO2

for CeO2.

systems. It appears clear that the use of the Vegard rule for the
assessment of formation of a solid solution and for the
derivation of the CexZr12xO2 composition may become critical
for very small particles (typically , 15 nm), since an apparent
lattice parameter is measured in this case. The application of
the Vegard rule becomes sensitive to the crystallite size as
illustrated in Fig. 2; accordingly for the same lattice parameter
very different compositions can be derived according to the
nature of the sample (HSA or LSA). This possible source of
error may become severe when a rough XRD analysis is
performed using only the main peak ((111) or (101) reflections
for respectively the c- and t- phases) for assessing the Vegard
rule. An increase in lattice parameter of 0.19% with respect to
the ideal value is observed when the Rietveld refinement is
performed in the region 20–65u(2h) on the above quoted
t-Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 (12 nm) compared to a deviation of 0.02% when
the fitting is performed in the interval 70–125u(2h) due to the
fact that long distances, including the surface layer, are
sampled in the low-angle interval. We attribute these varia-
tions to surface lattice relaxation. Consistently, nanoanalysis
using EDAX did not reveal appreciable variations of the local
chemical composition.
In light of these observations, the contribution of surface
lattice relaxations to the variations of the lattice parameters,
which were found by Mamontov et al.73 and attributed to the
presence of nanodomains, cannot be excluded.113
The presence of a nanocrystalline layer that presents
different structural properties with respect to the bulk of the
materials nicely fits the kinetic model reported by Trovarelli
and co-workers for CeO2 reduction,117,118 which suggested
that the typical two peaks temperature reduction profile of
HSA CeO2
119 can be described as a reduction of two distinct
systems: a nanocrystalline and a microcrystalline, bulk, type of
CeO2.
2.3. Oxygen sublattice and cation ordering
Perturbation to the oxygen lattice by insertion of ZrO2 into the
CeO2 lattice has long been recognised as an important factor
leading to the exceptional capability of these mixed oxides to
be reduced in the bulk under much milder conditions
compared to bulk CeO2.59,60,120 We recall that dependency
of the reduction behaviour on structural properties has been
inferred on the basis of the low reduction temperature (500–
700 K) that has been observed in microcrystalline Rh/
CexZr12xO2 (x 5 0.1–1): the reduction temperature decreased
as the Zr content was increased from 0 to 50 mol%, and then it
again increased as the Zr content was varied from 60 to
90 mol%. The presence of Rh, which efficiently dissociates H2
at the surface, use of a sintered ceramic type of mixed oxides
and the fairly low reduction temperature suggested migration
of the oxygen species as rate limiting for the reduction
process;60 no isotopic kinetic effect was observed for low
temperature reduction of a Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 mixed oxide using
deuterium as reducing agent in subsequent studies, confirming
the validity of this hypothesis.83,121
Accordingly, the observed structural–redox dependency pro-
mpted the interest in structural analysis of the oxygen sublattice
to identify the origin of this phenomenon.38,71,83,91,122–125
At ambient pressure ZrO2 features three polymorphs,
depending on the temperature (Scheme 1).35 The ionic radius
of Zr(IV) is too small to ensure stability of the ZrO8
polyhedron, on the other hand it is not sufficiently small
enough to ensure the stability of the ZrO6 polyhedron.126
Accordingly, the stable at RT ZrO2 polymorph is baddeleyite
(m-ZrO2), which is constituted of basic ZrO7 polyhedra.
As explained above, except for the m- and c-phases, all the
other tetragonal phases can crystallographically be indexed in
the P42/nmc space group that gives two t-ZrO2 formula units
per unit cell; Zr at (0,0,0) and (1/2,1/2,1/2) special positions and
O at (0,1/2,z), (1/2,0,2z), (0,1/2,1/2 + z) and (1/2,0,1/2 2 z),
where the tetragonal displacement of the oxygen atoms is
directed along the c-cell parameter. The relationship between
the cubic cell and the tetragonal distortion of the oxygen
positions with respect to the fluorite structure is illustrated in
Fig. 5.
Before discussing the CeO2–ZrO2 system, it is important to
recall some structural features of both ZrO2 and the so-called
partially (PSZ) and fully (FSZ) stabilised zirconias, which are
technologically important advanced ceramics composed of
doped ZrO2 in tetragonal and cubic form, respectively. Their
importance stems from the observation that the martensitic
t A m phase transformation brings about a significant volume
expansion, which makes the precipitation of the ceramic
material
in
the
metastable
t-form
a
desirable
process.
Subsequently, for example on cooling of the ceramic material
or when it is subjected to an external stress, the expansion
induced by the t A m phase transformation is able to block
diffusion of cracks, resulting in materials with high strength
and
toughness.7,127–129
Despite
more
than
30
years
of
discussions, the exact mechanism of these transformations
does not seem to be yet elucidated,130 also due to the lack of a
full comprehension of the structural properties of these
materials. In fact, whereas m-ZrO2 is the stable polymorph

at RT, t-ZrO2 and even c-ZrO2 were stabilised at RT, provided
that a sufficiently small particle size has been obtained in the
synthesis.131–134 Independently of the origin of the stabilisation
of the metastable forms at RT (surface strain, surface free
energy, topotactic crystallisation, etc.),132,135,136 it is important
to notice that these transformations are very subtle in their
nature and often occur in a continuous manner rather than as
a discontinuous process, particularly in very small particles.137
Thus, decrease of the ZrO2 particle size led to ‘‘deterioration’’
of XRD patterns of Y2O3-doped ZrO2. The Raman spectra
also changed, due to the increasing influence of the surface
layer; the critical size where only bulk features are observed is
above ca. 15 nm.138 Furthermore, due to the low sensitivity of
conventional XRD patterns to oxygen atoms, the exact
determination of the oxygen sublattice is even more diffi-
cult.139 Simulation of XRD patterns of nanosized ZrO2
particles showed that the high symmetry XRD patterns of
nanocrystalline t- and c-ZrO2 phases can be successfully
modelled using a disordered model consisting of m-ZrO2
particles.140 In fact, the nature of these nanocrystalline systems
is very often highly disordered: evidence for a skin of m-ZrO2
and twinned particles, often undetectable by X-ray techniques,
growing at the surface of the t-ZrO2 nanocrystals, has been
found.141–148 Synthesis conditions in fact play a critical role
when these materials are prepared in the nanocrystalline form;
this is due to the fact that according to the conditions and rate
of the hydrolysis of the ZrO2 precursors, formation of either
m- or t-phase may be favoured.149,150
Even for sintered Y2O3-doped ZrO2, which are considered
well characterised PSZ (for 3 mol% , Y2O3 , 10 mol%) and
FSZ (Y2O3 . 10 mol%) systems, there are controversies
concerning the oxygen localisation within the lattice. Thus
studies have identified oxygen displacements along (001), (111)
or both directions (compare ref. 151 and references therein).
Discussion of the structural features of Y2O3–ZrO2 is out of
the scope of the present paper; however, there is an important
conclusion that stems from the above considerations: there is a
strong variability of the structural features of these systems,
due to the particular nature of the ZrO2-based systems, where
formation of a metastable phase, particularly in the case of the
nanosized systems, can give rise to structurally different and
possibly subtly non-homogenous systems, for which structural
characterisation becomes very difficult.
In a systematic study of the effects of doping on the
stabilisation
mechanism
of
ZrO2,
Li
et
al.109–111,152–154
evaluated the effects of dopant valency and radius on the
stabilisation of tetragonal zirconias. A general picture of the
stabilisation mechanism can be derived, where the role of
the dopant is essentially that of releasing the stress around the
Zr(IV) atom that is generated by adoption of tetragonal or
cubic symmetry (coordination number CN 5 8) with respect to
the monoclinic one (CN 5 7). Accordingly, low-valent
(valence , IV) and large cations appear as the most effective
ones in stabilising PSZ systems due to the fact that: (i) oxygen
vacancies are created, which effectively decrease the number of
oxygen atoms in the lattice, and (ii) these oxygen vacancies are
preferably located at the smaller Zr(IV) cation, releasing the
steric hindrance due to an overcrowded coordination sphere.
The more effective this mechanism of stress release, the higher
the symmetry of the mixed oxides, a Zr CN of 7.5 is typically
observed at the tetragonal–cubic boundary.111
Accordingly, also in the case of the CeO2–ZrO2 system, the
structural constraints concerning the co-ordination of Zr(IV)
still play a role. In addition, it is important to recall that CeO2
adopts a fluorite type of structure. Therefore, if the system is
considered from this point of view, the same reason which is
responsible
for
the
metastability
of
the
intermediate
CexZr12xO2 compositions (i.e. the small ionic radius of
Zr(IV) compared to Ce(IV)) may be considered the origin of
the modifications of the oxygen sublattice. In fact, it has
already been recognised in the pioneering works by Leonov
et al.25,40 that addition of ZrO2 to CeO2 generates structural
defects in the solid, however, the exact nature of the
modifications of oxygen sublattice and of the defects is still a
matter for discussion.38,71,91,93 A number of reasons may
account for this; accordingly we will try to provide a rationale.
Two important factors dominate the structural features of
the single-phase CexZr12xO2 solid solutions: (i) oxide compo-
sition and (ii) particle size (nanocrystalline (HSA) or micro-
crystalline, sintered-bulk type (LSA) systems). Let us first
consider the aspects related to the compositional issues,
considering the microcrystalline systems (ceramic type of
oxides). The parent oxide structurally dominates at each
CeO2-rich and ZrO2-rich extreme of the phase diagram.
Accordingly, Yashima et al. observed the t0 tetragonal
distortion in the oxygen sublattice for CeO2 contents higher
than 70 mol%,32 this value was later corrected on the basis of
high resolution XRD measurements to 90 mol%.94 On the
opposite side, the monoclinic structure is maintained up to
approximately 10 mol% of the CeO2 content, with both cell
parameter and all positional parameters gradually approach-
ing those of the t-Ce0.15Zr0.85O2.33 The tetragonal phase,
structurally related to t-ZrO2, with c/a 5 1.019–1.016, is found
for CeO2 content in the range ca. 10–25 mol%. A typical two-
shell
oxygen
coordination
sphere
is
found
around
the
zirconium atom with Zr–O bond lengths of ca. 0.210 and
0.235 nm.110 This oxygen sublattice was confirmed by Raman
spectroscopy.155
As written above, the metastable t9 and t0 phases exist at the
intermediate CeO2–ZrO2 compositions. The t9 phase typically
co-exists in the ceramic materials with the t-phase for CeO2
contents 25–40 mol%, which prevents a detailed analysis of the
oxygen sublattice in this composition field.29,43,91 Notice,
however, that cooling conditions play a critical role in the
preparation of these ceramic materials: on rapid cooling the
phase segregation predicted by phase diagram may, in fact, be
prevented. Thus, Torng et al. prepared a series of fully
tetragonal CexZr12xO2 solid solutions,156 which were char-
acterised by domains containing a c-phase.157 This phase
presents an oxygen displacement along the (111) direction.158
Increasing the CeO2 amount to and above 50 mol%, single
phase products can be achieved that have been characterised
by several researchers.29,32,47,94 Raman spectroscopy has been
employed to define the exact boundaries of the existence of the
various tetragonal, t-, t9-, t99-, and c-phases, due to its
sensitivity to the M–O bonds. Group analysis of the symmetry
around the metal cation in the tetragonal phase predicts six
Raman active modes of the A1g + 2B1g + 3Eg, whereas for the

cubic phase a single mode of F2g symmetry is observed at 490
and 465 cm21 respectively for cubic ZrO2 and CeO2.32,155,159
A perusal of the spectra reported in Fig. 6 reveals the
complexity of the systems, in that the tetragonal (six) and cubic
(single band) patterns are neatly observed only at the limiting
compositions, i.e. ZrO2- and CeO2-rich ones. For intermediate
compositions such patterns, particularly the tetragonal one,
are ill defined; less then the six predicted bands are observed.
This, together with the observation by EXAFS of a highly
disordered oxygen next nearest neighbour (NNN) shell, where
only six out of eight NNN could be detected, suggested that
the insertion of ZrO2 into the lattice leads to a highly
disordered local M–O situation at intermediate CeO2–ZrO2
compositions, which is responsible for the high mobility of
the oxygen atoms in the bulk of the material.91,122 Thus
structural–redox correlations could be identified,60,91 where
the structure and hence the chemical behaviour are dominated
by the parent (t-ZrO2 and CeO2 respectively) oxide at the two
extremes, i.e. ZrO2- and CeO2-rich compositions. The situa-
tion, however, is even more complex, due to the fact that in
analogy to what happen to ZrO2, the structural properties
related to the oxygen sublattice appear strongly related to the
nanocrystalline nature of the mixed oxide. As shown in Fig. 7,
on increasing the calcination temperature of a nanocrystalline
Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 single-phase product, as defined by the above
quoted criterion, significant modifications of the Raman
pattern were observed, as denoted by the increase of the
intensity of the band at 525 cm21.
Recently, a careful investigation92 of the Raman spectra of
these mixed oxides revealed the high sensitivity of the Raman
technique to the presence of unintentional impurities, particu-
larly rare earth impurities, that give rise to strong adsorption
bands even in the region of M–O lattice vibrations; different
Raman patterns could be obtained using different excitation
line wavelengths. According to the nature of the eventual
impurity and its electronic band structure, highly intense
electronic vibrations were observed that have been assigned to
impurity cations occupying highly distorted sites where a break
of the symmetry rules allows observation of such bands. An
important conclusion arising from this study is that the
presence of such impurities may be taken as a diagnostic test of
the presence of important distortions in the lattice, which
strongly depended on the CeO2 (or respectively ZrO2) content.
In summary, these studies suggested for intermediate CeO2–
ZrO2 compositions a significant degree of structural disorder
being introduced into the CeO2 lattice as the amount of ZrO2
inserted is increased. Further, the nanocrystalline nature also
leads to modification of the oxygen sublattice with respect to
the microcrystalline systems. Consistently, different M–O
coordination spheres were detected in the EXAFS investiga-
tion of nano- and microcrystalline Ce0.6Z0.4O2.71
The peculiar sensitivity of the oxygen sublattice to variations
in the nature of the mixed oxide was also confirmed160 by near-
edge XAS measurements (XANES), which showed that as the
amount of Zr inserted into the lattice is increased, the
separation and relative intensity of the peaks denoted as a
and b in Fig. 8, assigned to electronic transitions from the
occupied Zr 2p orbitals to the empty Zr 4d orbitals, are
strongly influenced by the chemical composition. An increase

of ZrO2 content in the mixed oxide quickly leads to features
resembling those of ZrO2, particularly at the Zr LIII-edge;
some similarity is also found at the oxygen K-edge, however,
the signal cannot be considered as a sum of the CeO2 and ZrO2
contributions. XANES and ELNES spectra taken at the
oxygen K-edge have been indicated as a sensitive tool, able to
discriminate the local symmetry around the cation in Y2O3
doped ZrO2.161 Consistently, the oxygen K-edge spectrum
reported in Fig. 8 shows a remarkable change in the oxygen
coordination environment as the amount of ZrO2 inserted into
the CeO2 lattice is increased. Lack of neat separation between
the 4d-eg and 4d-t2g features and the small separation between
them suggest that such changes can hardly be attributed to a
simple cubic-to-tetragonal transition of the local symmetry in
the oxide.161
Lemaux et al. suggested, in an interesting methodological
study on the elaboration of EXAFS data in ZrO2-containing
systems,38 that the high oxygen mobility in the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2
should preferentially be ascribed to a tetragonal coordination
of the oxygen atoms. In this way, the mixed oxide can be seen
as a layered structure, following the original structural model
of t-ZrO2 reported by Teufer,162 where the oxygen atoms can
easily move, due to the fact that the oxygen atoms located at
the longer distance from Zr experience weaker M–O bonds,
leading to high oxygen mobility. According to this investiga-
tion,38 the above quoted structural model, where oxygen atoms
at longer distance appear highly disordered, cannot describe
the CeO2–ZrO2 system, since they found a comparable
coordination in both HSA Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and Y2O3 (1 mol%)–
ZrO2. Unfortunately, in their study the authors missed the
critical points concerning the characterisation of these ZrO2-
containing mixed oxides when in the form of nanomaterials. In
fact, a crystallite size of about 5–6 nm can be evaluated from
Figure 1 reported in the paper38 and, as clearly commented
above, XRD characterisation of such nanomaterials using the
Rietveld method is prone to controversies. Consistently, the
authors could not refine thermal factors for the structures
of both the reference Y2O3–ZrO2 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 nano-
materials, indicating a strong disorder of the system.71 This
means that the assertion that their Y2O3 (1 mol%)–ZrO2
reference material had a well-defined symmetry of the M–O
bond was not supported by experimental evidence. The
presence of a monoclinic phase is dictated by phase diagram
for such a composition. As indicated above, the change of the
metal coordination with particle size, often undetectable by
XRD,143 is well documented for either the Y2O3–ZrO2 and
CexZr12xO2 systems.71,130 Further work is needed to properly
assess the M–O environment in these systems by EXAFS.
In summary, a strong dependency of the metal–oxygen
coordination sphere on the composition and particle size of the
CexZr12xO2 has unequivocally been detected, the exact nature
of such modifications with respect to the parent oxides needs
further investigations that should properly consider the issues
related to the nanosize nature of these mixed oxides.
An important aspect is the capability of the reduced
CexZr12xO22y to form pyrochlore related structures, where
an ordered cation sublattice can be achieved. The interest in
the formation of such structures arises from the fact that redox
ageing
treatments,
typically
consisting
of
a
deep
(high
temperature) reduction, followed by a mild oxidation, have
been identified as a tool to produce CexZr12xO22y oxides
characterised by a low reduction temperature compared to the
starting materials.37,51,55–57,163 Thus, application of such a
redox ageing procedure to HSA Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 produced a shift
of the reduction from 900 to 700 K, despite a severe sintering
experienced by the sample; the BET area dropped from 65 to
below 5 m2 g21.37 A remarkably low reduction temperature
of 500 K could be achieved by such redox ageing in a
Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 sample.97 However, the effects of this redox
treatment are reversible in that when the sample is oxidised at
high temperature, rather than at a mild one, a temperature
programmed reduction (TPR) profile featuring a reduction
peak at high temperature is again obtained.56 Importantly,
such reversible chemical behaviour has been observed in
samples
of
different
compositions,
whereas
a
common
observation is that the extent of such promotion appears
related to the extent of sintering experienced by the mixed
oxide, i.e. sintered oxides appear more susceptible to the effects

of the pre-treatment.63,64,83,97 For such sintered oxides (LSA,
microcrystalline materials), evidence for formation of an
ordered k phase obtained by the reduction/mild oxidation
treatment was reported.51,52,55 The observation of favourable
redox properties prompted strong interest in investigation of
such ordered phases; in fact, comparison of the OSC of a series
of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 mixed oxides increased as the homogeneity and
ordering of the solid solution was improved.123,124 This was
attributed to the higher rate of the oxygen diffusion in these
ordered systems.164 We will not address the exact mechanism
of the oxygen mobility and OSC functionality of these mixed
oxides, as this has been addressed recently,23,165 but wish to
point out that discussion still exists54 whether formation of the
ordered structures is a consequence of the redox ageing
treatment
or
it
is
their
formation
which
favours
low
temperature reduction and hence efficient OSC. We have in
fact recently shown that formation of an ordered phase is
not a necessary prerequisite to obtain a low temperature
TPR profile.23,166 Surface modifications, performed under
conditions where formation of ordered structures is unlikely,
led to TPR profiles with reduction occurring at quite low
temperatures.23,167–169
However, it is important to recognise that the sequence of
the different redox treatments is an important aspect, as
illustrated in Fig. 9. The combination of the reduction/
oxidation treatments can lead to a variety of different phases
that feature, however, a high degree of metastability. Even a
modest increase of the re-oxidation temperature easily leads to
a disordered type of cation structure.
Noticeably, these systems are structurally related to the
parent oxide; in the pyrochlore structure (Ce2Zr2O7), the Zr
and Ce cations are arranged in a cubic structure and the
oxygen atoms are located at tetrahedral sites. The structure is
related to that of fluorite with 1/8 of the anions missing and
thus may be considered as an ordered defect structure
(Fd3
¯m).50 The presence of the oxygen vacancies makes re-
oxidation easy and accordingly Ce2Zr2O7+y phases are easily
formed. The oxidation occurs even at RT and appears to
proceed selectively in that the interstitial oxygen enters the 8b
sites, which are vacant in the pyrochlore, but displacement of
the existing oxygen atoms in the 8a sites also occurs as the
formal
composition
of
Ce2Zr2O7.2
is
exceeded.50
It
is
important to note that recent studies confirmed the possibility
of the cation ordering even for compositions different from
those of a pyrochlore precursor,171 i.e. Ce2Zr2O8, suggesting a
large flexibility of these mixed oxides to act also as oxygen
intercalation devices due to the easy formation of the
substoichiometric oxides.49,172 It is important to underline
the delicate balance of the redox conditions leading to the
formation of these ordered systems due to the fact that
the presence of anti-phase domain boundaries may lead to the
identification of different structures by XRD, according to the
conditions of sample preparation.52 This highly ordered
CexZr12xO2 mixed oxide (k-phase) could be reduced at fairly
low temperature.
The indications that arise from these observations can
provide some insight into the redox chemistry of these oxides
and particularly their peculiar capability to reduce in bulk at
temperatures which are much lower compared to the parent
CeO2. As shown in a series of elegant papers by Trovarelli and
coworkers,117,118 the two peak reduction profiles of HSA CeO2
can be effectively modelled as a reduction of two kinds of
materials: nano- and microcrystalline CeO2. Since the diffusion
can control the TPR behaviour only at low temperatures,83,117
the observation of the high temperature peak in CeO2 at a
much higher temperature (1100 K) compared to CexZr12xO2
(about 900 K) can be attributed to the fact that the CeO2 phase
diagram shows a dome-like region of immiscibility between the
nonstoichiometric a-CeO22x and CeO2. Only above ca. 960 K,
there is a continuous region of substoichiometric oxides,
suggesting that the difficulty of reduction in the bulk of the
microcrystalline CeO2 could be associated with the energy
demanding segregation phenomena due to the order–disorder
transition,

the stoichiometry of the reduced mixed oxide (Fig. 10). It is
interesting to observe the nearly constant composition that is
achieved before the second reduction process started. It
indicates that the first step stabilizes the same number of
vacancies for all composition. When a tetrahedral defect is
formed
in
the
fcc
lattice,
strain
is
introduced
in
the
surrounding tetrahedra, which increases the lattice energy
locally.173,174 The magnitude of this strain can be assumed to
be inversely proportional to the distance from the central
defect, and it is so large in the nearest-neighbour tetrahedra
that formation of new defects is not favoured. The MO1.92
composition corresponds for a fluorite structure to macro-
complexes of seven T23 units.173,174 As the reduction proceeds,
rearranging of the defect association may occur, which clearly
depends on the ZrO2 content of the mixed oxide (Fig. 10). The
relatively small ionic parameter of Zr(IV) compared to Ce(IV)
(0.084 vs. 0.097 nm), in addition to favouring creation of
structural defects and therefore oxygen vacancies,25,60,93 helps
to cope with the lattice stress generated by the expansion of
the CeO2 lattice upon reduction (ionic diameter of Ce(III) 5
0.110 nm). The key role of ZrO2 is therefore to break the
immiscibility gap in the CeO2 phase diagram, which may be
further favoured by creation of ordered structures, thus
leading to a facile reduction in the bulk. In the case of
nanocrystalline CeO2, different reaction paths may occur due
to the critical role of the nanosized domains of the solid that
may affect the phase diagram.37 Whereas such a picture may
hold for the TPR processes, it is important to realise that a
different picture may arise when fast redox processes are
considered and also in the absence of the supported metal
particles, where activation of hydrogen at the surface may be
difficult.
It is important to underline the critical role of the nanometre
scale in this context also, as low temperature reduction could
be achieved on nanocrystalline systems under conditions where
such structure ordering may not be occurring.23,166
3. Textural properties of CeO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides
High surface area of the solid and its thermal stability are
essential prerequisites for any catalytic application in order to
maximise both the contact with the reactants and the
durability of the catalyst. As pointed out previously,175 the
requirements for the environmental catalysts are highly
demanding in comparison to industrial catalysts, due to the
wide variability of the reaction conditions (temperature and
composition) and very high space velocity of the reactants that
require extreme activity and high selectivity; conversion of
ppm level of pollutants are typically needed in streams of much
more concentrated different reactants. Due to their use in the
TWCs, the thermal stability required for CeO2-based oxides
has changed over the years as the converter technology
continued its development.176,177 Nowadays, thermal stability
up to 1373 K is typically required for the catalysts closely
coupled to the engine, which requires an extremely robust
design of the textural properties of the material. On the other
hand, many applications of CeO2-based materials operate
under mild conditions, which may require different synthesis
approaches for their preparation. In our view, it is extremely
important to focus on which is the final application of the
material in order to appropriately design the synthesis, leading
to the desired properties. Let us focus on thermal stability at
high temperatures first. Generally speaking, the addition of
ZrO2 was always aimed at increasing the thermal stability of
CeO2, which easily sinters above 1073 K, particularly under a
reducing atmosphere.178,179 An investigation of the effects of
ZrO2 content on the thermal stability suggested Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 as
a suitable composition;180 in contrast, ZrO2-rich compositions
were found to be more thermally stable compared to CeO2-rich
compositions
in
other
studies.181,182
Using
a
polymeric
precursor route with citrate as complexing agent, the lowest
sintering was observed for a Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 composition.68 Very
importantly, a single phase Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 solid solution with
high thermal stability featured very different redox behaviour
as a function of redox pre-treatments compared to that of a
poor thermal stability, indicating the importance of textural
properties on the chemical behaviour.97 Clearly, a rationale for
deriving the effects of the composition on thermal stability is
needed.
Let us first recall that the sintering behaviour of ceramic-
type materials is strongly affected by the pore structure of the
material itself.183 Broadly speaking, both the pore curvature
and pore radius are extremely important factors, larger pores
with negative pore curvature preventing sintering of the
materials. An example of the importance of the pore structure
on the rate of sintering/decrease of BET surface area following
calcination at high temperatures is shown in Fig. 11.
The first two samples were prepared to feature BET areas of
65 m2 g21 and 35 m2 g21 respectively, however, the second
sample was synthesized to produce a pore distribution centred
at pore radii significantly higher compared to first one.97 After
calcination at 1273 K for 5 h, the surface areas decrease
respectively to 9 and 22 m2 g21. This accounts for a relative
decrease of surface area of respectively 86 and 37 %. In terms
of durability of the TWCs, clearly the behaviour observed for
the second sample is more desirable because such a relatively
small drop in surface area after calcination at 1273 K suggests
that negligible loss of precious metal due to metal particle
encapsulation should occur in this case. Interestingly, when a
sample with a bimodal pore distribution was prepared, an
appreciable BET area (9 m2 g21) could be achieved even after

calcination at 1373 K. During the sintering process the pores at
smaller radii grow partially producing pores of large radii, thus
providing some additional stability to the system for very high
calcination temperatures.
Such importance of the initial texture on the thermal
stability of these mixed oxides was recently reported by
researchers from Rhodia who showed that the bimodal–fractal
type of pore distribution, exemplified in Fig. 12, confers a
remarkably high thermal stability to these mixed oxides. Again
it is observed that when the porous solid is sintered at high
temperature, pores with small radii tend to both annihilate
and grow. Accordingly, they partially act as a reservoir to the
secondary network of the macro-pores generated by the
synthesis, which is nearly unaffected by the thermal treatment.
In such a way, a final texture consisting of a network of very
large pores is produced, which confers a significant BET area
to the product after calcination at very high temperatures. It is
also claimed that the presence of such a stable pore network,
generated by the synthesis, minimizes encapsulation of the
precious metal particles upon ageing,184 which is a typical
drawback of CexZr12xO2 with poor textural stability.185 It is
interesting
to
observe
that
the
reported
bimodal
pore
distribution represents a kind of hierarchical network186 where
both types of pores can contribute to the final property, i.e.
thermal stability of the product.
Summarising, these results neatly show the critical role of
the pore design in providing textural stability at high
temperature. Thus researchers from Ford observed remark-
ably high thermal stability of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (30 m2 g21 after
calcination at 1323 K for 12 h) using a cellulose template for
the synthesis of the solid solution; such synthesis conferred a
filamentous-like morphology to the mixed oxide particles. A
corollary of these results is that the effects of the composition
can be detected only when systems of comparable textural
properties are considered.
Apart from the morphology–texture of these mixed oxides,
the degree of crystallinity as induced by hydrothermal methods
or by performing a medium to high temperature hydrolysis of
ceria and zirconia precursors also appeared as an important
factor leading to appreciable textural stability of the pro-
ducts.187–190 This indicates that both texture, in terms of pore
distribution, and the conditions of the crystallisation of the
product, affect the thermal stability of the surface area of
CexZr12xO2 mixed oxides.
In our view, the above quoted examples, taken from
industrial sources, provide an important warning as far as
the development of a novel synthesis of the CeO2-containing
materials is concerned. There has been flourishing activity in
this field in the last few years (compare for example ref. 5 and
references therein); many of the products, however, do not
present comparable performances to easily available industrial
products, at least in terms of thermal stability, which is the
critical property for their current application.
We believe that a target-oriented synthesis represents the
real challenge for the development of novel CeO2-based
materials. For example, stabilisation of extremely small
CeO2-containing nanoparticles192–198 resulted in materials
presenting an appreciable blue-shift of the UV absorption

with respect to conventional high surface area CeO2, which
opens the field to new applications such as cosmetics,
etc.21,22,199 Similarly, formation of a regular mesoporous
structure that has been achieved by different synthesis
strategies could represent an interesting route for providing
some kind of shape selectivity to these systems, applicable in
oxidation reaction, whereas application of such materials to
automotive catalysis is unlikely.200–204 As shown above, use of
mesoporous systems with relatively small pore radii is not an
attractive way for developing high performance TWCs due to
the fact that under the harsh converter conditions such pores
would invariably sinter. A few interesting examples of focused
syntheses of CeO2-containing materials have been reported
recently showing the importance of choosing the proper target
before simply addressing the synthesis issues.205,206
4. Conclusions
The critical analysis of the structural and textural properties of
CeO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides here reported clearly indicates the
paramount importance of the nanostructure of the material in
conferring both the chemical and structural properties to the
solid. Evidence was provided that for this conceptually very
simple system, synthesis and characterisation of the nanosized
material represent serious challenges due to the fact that many
of the classical characterisation methodologies are unable to
provide a detailed picture of the material at a very short,
nanosized, scale. This generates a complex situation, where
even the use of lattice parameter to assess the presence of a
solid solution, i.e. the well-known Vegard rule, can lead to
erroneous conclusions. CexZr12xO2 materials that are nomin-
ally equal, but with different nanodomain structure and
texture, feature different chemical and structural properties.
This highlights the need for very careful, critical and multi-
technique characterisation of these materials before their exact
nature can be properly assessed, and, in particular, possible
nanoscale heterogeneities can be evidenced.
A simple general criterion for evidencing the bulk-type of
heterogeneities is proposed here, which also takes into account
the apparently puzzling problem of the difference in the lattice
parameter between the nano- and microsized CexZr12xO2 solid
solutions. On the other hand, a criterion for detection of
surface nanosized non-homogeneities is missing, even though
spectroscopic analysis of adsorbed probe molecules seems
the most promising technique. In fact, definition of such
standard criteria for the assessment of the homogeneity/non-
homogeneity and nanodomain structure, also at the surface,
would open the door for the synthesis of standard reference
CexZr12xO2 solid solutions, leading to an unified description
of the properties of these intriguing materials. This could
provide a deep insight into some of the unexplained features of
these systems, such as their tuneable redox properties, e.g. high
or low temperature OSC, which can be induced by the pre-
treatments. Furthermore, use of ‘‘standard’’ CexZr12xO2 solid
solutions could allow development of general strategies,
leading to the above discussed ordered systems, potentially
attractive as intercalation devices and solid state electrolytes.
The design of the textural properties has attracted strong
interest in the industrial area, as a consequence of the need for
developing thermally stable materials, whereas it received only
relatively limited attention by other researchers. We believe
that this is an area of strong interest, as clear correlation
between chemical behaviour and textural properties have been
provided.97 This requires, however, the proper assessment of
the issue of the agglomeration of the nanoparticles, i.e. scaling-
up of the dimension of the material assembling process,
leading to a hierarchical architecture of the material. This field
is certainly of strong interest as it may lead to novel properties
and applications. Clearly, a target-oriented synthesis approach
must be applied in this case to open novel frontiers.
