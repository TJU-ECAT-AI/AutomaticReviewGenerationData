[1] "We use theory to identify energetically favored reaction pathways. We calculate the activation energy only for the most important steps: the reaction of CO with the adsorbed O2 molecule and the formation of an oxygen vacancy by transfer of an oxygen atom from the surface onto the dopant."

[2] "In previous calculations [50], we have found that doping ZnO with Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, or W increases substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the oxide; Al, Mg, Ca, La, Re, Os and Ce have a similar, but less pronounced, effect."

[3] "The fact that the oxygen atoms near the dopant bind more strongly to the oxide indicates that the dopant is undercoordinated. This would imply that such a dopant will adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy its need for a higher coordination."

[4] "We have used solgel synthesis to attempt the preparation of high-surface-area ZnO atomically doped with Al or Ti. We have chosen to work with Ti, Al and Zn because TiO2, Al2O3, or ZnO does not oxidize CO at temperatures below 450 C, where we perform our experiments."

[5] "We propose and demonstrate two CO oxidation pathways that are different from the traditional MVK mechanism. We have shown that cationic substitutional doping of ZnO with Ti or Al promotes adsorption of O2 on the dopant. Essentially, this happens because Ti and Al have a higher valence than Zn."

The study provides insights into how high-valence dopants (HVDs) like Ti and Al influence the catalytic properties of ZnO for CO oxidation:

1. Computational studies revealed that HVDs like Ti and Al increase the energy required to form oxygen vacancies on the ZnO surface, indicating stronger binding of oxygen atoms near the dopant.

2. HVDs are undercoordinated when substituting Zn atoms, leading to enhanced adsorption of O2 from the gas phase to satisfy their higher valence.

3. Experimental results showed that Ti- and Al-doped ZnO catalysts were active for CO oxidation at lower temperatures compared to pure ZnO, TiO2, or Al2O3.

4. Two novel CO oxidation pathways different from the traditional Mars-van Krevelen mechanism were proposed and demonstrated for HVD-doped ZnO.

The study focused primarily on HVDs and did not provide direct comparisons with same-valence dopants (SVDs). Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior were not explicitly discussed in the given excerpts. The study mainly considered ZnO as the host oxide, limiting generalizations to other metal oxide systems.

[5] "We believe that the fact that the dopant has a higher valence than Zn explains qualitatively the behavior of the doped oxide. There is, however, a second relevant factor: the Zn atoms do not adjust its valence to respond to the presence of a dopant; in the ZnOTi groups present on the surface, Zn will stay divalent."

The literature provides insights into how high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly ZnO:

1. HVDs like Ti and Al in ZnO increase the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation at the surface, indicating stronger binding of oxygen atoms near the dopant.

2. This stronger binding suggests that the dopant is undercoordinated, leading to increased adsorption of oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy its higher coordination needs.

3. The higher valence of dopants like Ti and Al compared to Zn promotes O2 adsorption on the dopant, enabling new CO oxidation pathways different from the traditional Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism.

4. The behavior of the doped oxide is explained by two factors: the higher valence of the dopant and the inability of Zn atoms to adjust their valence in response to the dopant's presence.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) plays a role, as exemplified by the difference between ZnO and CuO when doped with Ti.

2. The stability of the host cation's oxidation state affects the dopant's influence on catalytic properties.

3. Lewis acid-base interactions are not explicitly discussed in the given literature, indicating a potential area for further investigation.

The study combines computational and experimental approaches to gain these insights, using density functional theory calculations to identify energetically favorable reaction pathways and experimental techniques to validate the proposed mechanisms.

文献提供了有关高价掺杂剂（HVDs）如何影响金属氧化物（特别是ZnO）的催化性能的见解：

1. ZnO中的高价掺杂剂（如Ti和Al）增加了表面氧空位形成所需的能量，表明掺杂剂附近的氧原子结合更强。

2. 这种更强的结合表明掺杂剂配位不足，导致从气相吸附更多氧气以满足其更高的配位需求。

3. 与Zn相比，Ti和Al等掺杂剂的价态更高，促进了掺杂剂上的O2吸附，从而实现了不同于传统Mars-van Krevelen（MVK）机制的新CO氧化途径。

4. 掺杂氧化物的行为可以通过两个因素解释：掺杂剂的高价态和Zn原子无法调整其价态以响应掺杂剂的存在。

制定掺杂剂行为通用预测规则的挑战包括：

1. 宿主氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）起着重要作用，如Ti掺杂的ZnO和CuO之间的差异所示。

2. 宿主阳离子氧化态的稳定性影响掺杂剂对催化性能的影响。

3. 给定文献中未明确讨论Lewis酸碱相互作用，表明这是一个潜在的进一步研究领域。

该研究结合了计算和实验方法来获得这些见解，使用密度泛函理论计算来识别能量上有利的反应途径，并使用实验技术来验证所提出的机制。

The literature provides insights into how high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, specifically ZnO:

1. HVDs like Ti and Al in ZnO create new reaction pathways for CO oxidation that differ from the traditional Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

2. Doping ZnO with HVDs (Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, W) increases the energy required to form oxygen vacancies at the oxide surface. This effect is less pronounced for Al, Mg, Ca, La, Re, Os, and Ce.

3. HVDs in ZnO promote O2 adsorption on the dopant site, leading to enhanced catalytic activity for CO oxidation at lower temperatures compared to undoped ZnO.

4. The behavior observed in Ti- and Al-doped ZnO may be applicable to other oxide systems where the dopant has a higher valence than the host cation, especially if the host cation cannot reduce its valence in response to the dopant.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The complexity of interactions between dopants, host oxide, and reactants.
2. The influence of the host oxide's reducibility on dopant effects.
3. The need to consider factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the specific nature of the host oxide.

The literature does not provide direct information on same-valence dopants (SVDs) or their comparison to HVDs in this context.

[1] "We use theory to qualitatively explore various possibilities and to predict the best candidates, then use experiments to test whether the suggestions made by theory can be translated into real-world catalysts."

[2] "In the case of ZnO, many dopants increase the energy that is necessary for removing an oxygen atom from the surface [50]; doping the oxide with them will hinder the oxidation through the MVK pathway."

[3] "The fact that the oxygen atoms near the dopant bind more strongly to the oxide indicates that the dopant is undercoordinated. This would imply that such a dopant will adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy its need for a higher coordination."

[4] "Essentially, this happens because Ti and Al have a higher valence than Zn. When these dopants replace a Zn atom, at the surface of ZnO, they do not find enough lattice oxygen atoms to satisfy their valence. This drives them to adsorb gas-phase O2."

[5] "We speculate that numerous other oxides doped with cations having a higher valence than the host will behave like the present system in oxidation reactions, especially if the cation in the host is not able to reduce its valence when the dopant is present."

High-valence dopants (HVDs) like Ti and Al in ZnO influence catalytic properties by:

1. Increasing the binding energy of nearby oxygen atoms, making oxygen removal more difficult and hindering traditional Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) oxidation pathways.

2. Creating undercoordinated sites that readily adsorb and activate gas-phase oxygen, promoting alternative oxidation mechanisms.

3. Enabling new reaction pathways, such as direct reaction of adsorbed O2 with reactants like CO.

Computational studies have provided insights into these mechanisms, while experiments have confirmed the enhanced catalytic activity of HVD-doped ZnO for CO oxidation compared to undoped ZnO.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The complex interplay between dopant valence, host oxide reducibility, and Lewis acid-base interactions.

2. The ability (or inability) of host cations to adjust their valence in response to dopants.

3. The need to consider multiple potential reaction mechanisms that may occur simultaneously at different dopant sites.

While the study focuses on HVDs in ZnO, it suggests that similar behavior may be observed in other oxide systems doped with higher-valence cations, particularly when the host cations have a single stable oxidation state.

高价态掺杂剂（HVDs）如Ti和Al在ZnO中影响催化性能的方式包括：

1. 增加附近氧原子的结合能，使氧的移除更加困难，从而抑制传统的Mars-van Krevelen（MVK）氧化途径。

2. 创造配位不饱和位点，这些位点易于吸附和活化气相氧，促进替代氧化机制。

3. 实现新的反应途径，如吸附的O2直接与CO等反应物反应。

计算研究为这些机制提供了见解，而实验证实了HVD掺杂的ZnO相比未掺杂ZnO具有增强的CO氧化催化活性。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的挑战包括：

1. 掺杂剂价态、宿主氧化物可还原性和Lewis酸碱相互作用之间的复杂关系。

2. 宿主阳离子调整其价态以响应掺杂剂的能力（或无能力）。

3. 需要考虑可能在不同掺杂位点同时发生的多种潜在反应机制。

虽然该研究集中于ZnO中的HVDs，但它表明在其他被高价态阳离子掺杂的氧化物系统中可能观察到类似行为，特别是当宿主阳离子具有单一稳定氧化态时。
