          [1] "We use theory to identify energetically favored reaction pathways. We calculate the activation energy only for the most important steps: the reaction of CO with the adsorbed O2 molecule and the formation of an oxygen vacancy by transfer of an oxygen atom from the surface onto the dopant."

[2] "In previous calculations [50], we have found that doping ZnO with Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, or W increases substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the oxide; Al, Mg, Ca, La, Re, Os and Ce have a similar, but less pronounced, effect."

[3] "The fact that the oxygen atoms near the dopant bind more strongly to the oxide indicates that the dopant is undercoordinated. This would imply that such a dopant will adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy its need for a higher coordination."

[4] "We propose and demonstrate two CO oxidation pathways that are different from the traditional MVK mechanism. We have shown that cationic substitutional doping of ZnO with Ti or Al promotes adsorption of O2 on the dopant. Essentially, this happens because Ti and Al have a higher valence than Zn."

[5] "We speculate that numerous other oxides doped with cations having a higher valence than the host will behave like the present system in oxidation reactions, especially if the cation in the host is not able to reduce its valence when the dopant is present."

          The study provides insights into how high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly ZnO:

1. HVDs like Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, and W in ZnO increase the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation at the surface, indicating stronger binding of oxygen atoms near the dopant. Al, Mg, Ca, La, Re, Os, and Ce have a similar but less pronounced effect.

2. The stronger binding suggests that the dopant is undercoordinated, leading to increased adsorption of oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy its higher coordination needs.

3. HVDs like Ti and Al in ZnO create new reaction pathways for CO oxidation that differ from the traditional Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. These new pathways involve O2 adsorption on the dopant site, followed by reaction with CO.

4. The higher valence of dopants like Ti and Al compared to Zn promotes O2 adsorption on the dopant, enabling these new oxidation pathways.

5. This behavior may be applicable to other oxide systems where the dopant has a higher valence than the host cation, especially if the host cation cannot reduce its valence in response to the dopant.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The complexity of interactions between dopants, host oxide, and reactants.
2. The influence of the host oxide's reducibility on dopant effects.
3. The need to consider factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the specific nature of the host oxide.
4. The potential for multiple reaction mechanisms occurring simultaneously at different dopant sites.

The study combines computational and experimental approaches, using density functional theory calculations to identify energetically favorable reaction pathways and experimental techniques to validate the proposed mechanisms. However, the literature does not provide direct information on same-valence dopants (SVDs) or their comparison to HVDs in this context.

          该研究提供了关于高价掺杂剂（HVDs）如何影响金属氧化物（特别是ZnO）的催化性能的见解：

1. ZnO中的HVDs（如Ti、V、Zr、Nb、Hf、Ta和W）增加了表面氧空位形成所需的能量，表明掺杂剂附近的氧原子结合更强。Al、Mg、Ca、La、Re、Os和Ce有类似但不太明显的效果。

2. 这种更强的结合表明掺杂剂配位不足，导致从气相吸附更多氧气以满足其更高的配位需求。

3. ZnO中的HVDs（如Ti和Al）创造了不同于传统Mars-van Krevelen机制的CO氧化新反应途径。这些新途径涉及O2在掺杂位点的吸附，随后与CO反应。

4. 与Zn相比，Ti和Al等掺杂剂的价态更高，促进了掺杂剂上的O2吸附，从而实现了这些新的氧化途径。

5. 这种行为可能适用于其他氧化物系统，其中掺杂剂的价态高于主体阳离子，特别是当主体阳离子不能因应掺杂剂而降低其价态时。

制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战包括：

1. 掺杂剂、主体氧化物和反应物之间相互作用的复杂性。
2. 主体氧化物的可还原性对掺杂剂效果的影响。
3. 需要考虑诸如Lewis酸碱相互作用和主体氧化物的特定性质等因素。
4. 在不同掺杂位点可能同时发生多种反应机制的可能性。

该研究结合了计算和实验方法，使用密度泛函理论计算来识别能量上有利的反应途径，并使用实验技术来验证所提出的机制。然而，文献没有提供关于同价掺杂剂（SVDs）或其与HVDs在此背景下的比较的直接信息。
