[1] "We use theory to identify energetically favored reaction pathways. We calculate the activation energy only for the most important steps: the reaction of CO with the adsorbed O2 molecule and the formation of an oxygen vacancy by transfer of an oxygen atom from the surface onto the dopant."

[2] "In previous calculations [50], we have found that doping ZnO with Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, or W increases substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the oxide; Al, Mg, Ca, La, Re, Os and Ce have a similar, but less pronounced, effect."

[3] "The fact that the oxygen atoms near the dopant bind more strongly to the oxide indicates that the dopant is undercoordinated. This would imply that such a dopant will adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy its need for a higher coordination."

[4] "We have used solgel synthesis to attempt the preparation of high-surface-area ZnO atomically doped with Al or Ti. We have chosen to work with Ti, Al and Zn because TiO2, Al2O3, or ZnO does not oxidize CO at temperatures below 450 C, where we perform our experiments."

[5] "We propose and demonstrate two CO oxidation pathways that are different from the traditional MVK mechanism. We have shown that cationic substitutional doping of ZnO with Ti or Al promotes adsorption of O2 on the dopant. Essentially, this happens because Ti and Al have a higher valence than Zn."

The study provides insights into how high-valence dopants (HVDs) like Ti and Al influence the catalytic properties of ZnO for CO oxidation. Key findings include:

1. HVDs increase the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation at the oxide surface, indicating stronger binding of oxygen atoms near the dopant.

2. The undercoordinated nature of HVDs promotes O2 adsorption from the gas phase, satisfying their need for higher coordination.

3. Ti- and Al-doped ZnO demonstrate novel CO oxidation pathways different from the traditional Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism.

4. These pathways involve O2 adsorption on the dopant, which is then activated for reaction with CO.

5. The higher valence of Ti and Al compared to Zn is crucial for this behavior.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The complex interplay between dopant properties, host oxide characteristics, and reaction conditions.

2. The need to consider factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide.

3. The difficulty in experimentally verifying computational predictions, especially for low dopant concentrations.

4. The potential for multiple reaction mechanisms occurring simultaneously at different dopant sites.

While this study focuses on ZnO doped with Ti and Al, it suggests that similar behavior might be observed in other oxide systems doped with higher-valence cations, particularly when the host oxide cations have only one stable oxidation state.

这项研究提供了关于高价掺杂剂（HVDs）如钛和铝如何影响氧化锌在CO氧化中的催化性能的见解。主要发现包括：

1. HVDs增加了在氧化物表面形成氧空位所需的能量，表明掺杂剂附近的氧原子结合更强。

2. HVDs的配位不饱和性质促进了气相O2的吸附，满足了它们对更高配位的需求。

3. 掺杂Ti和Al的ZnO展示了不同于传统Mars-van Krevelen（MVK）机制的新型CO氧化途径。

4. 这些途径涉及O2在掺杂剂上的吸附，然后被活化与CO反应。

5. Ti和Al相比Zn的较高价态对这种行为至关重要。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的挑战包括：

1. 掺杂剂性质、宿主氧化物特性和反应条件之间的复杂相互作用。

2. 需要考虑诸如Lewis酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的可还原性等因素。

3. 实验验证计算预测的难度，特别是对于低浓度掺杂剂。

4. 在不同掺杂剂位点可能同时发生多种反应机制的可能性。

虽然这项研究集中在掺杂Ti和Al的ZnO上，但它暗示在其他掺杂高价阳离子的氧化物系统中可能观察到类似的行为，特别是当宿主氧化物阳离子只有一种稳定氧化态时。
