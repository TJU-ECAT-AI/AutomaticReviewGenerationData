[1] "We use theory to qualitatively explore various possibilities and to predict the best candidates, then use experiments to test whether the suggestions made by theory can be translated into real-world catalysts."

[2] "In the case of ZnO, many dopants increase the energy that is necessary for removing an oxygen atom from the surface [50]; doping the oxide with them will hinder the oxidation through the MVK pathway."

[3] "The fact that the oxygen atoms near the dopant bind more strongly to the oxide indicates that the dopant is undercoordinated. This would imply that such a dopant will adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy its need for a higher coordination."

[4] "Essentially, this happens because Ti and Al have a higher valence than Zn. When these dopants replace a Zn atom, at the surface of ZnO, they do not find enough lattice oxygen atoms to satisfy their valence. This drives them to adsorb gas-phase O2."

[5] "We speculate that numerous other oxides doped with cations having a higher valence than the host will behave like the present system in oxidation reactions, especially if the cation in the host is not able to reduce its valence when the dopant is present."

High-valence dopants (HVDs) like Ti and Al in ZnO influence catalytic properties by:

1. Increasing the binding energy of nearby oxygen atoms, making oxygen removal more difficult and hindering traditional Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) oxidation pathways.

2. Creating undercoordinated sites that readily adsorb and activate gas-phase oxygen, promoting alternative oxidation mechanisms.

3. Enabling new reaction pathways, such as direct reaction of adsorbed O2 with reactants like CO.

Computational studies have provided insights into these mechanisms, while experiments have confirmed the enhanced catalytic activity of HVD-doped ZnO for CO oxidation compared to undoped ZnO.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The complex interplay between dopant valence, host oxide reducibility, and Lewis acid-base interactions.

2. The ability (or inability) of host cations to adjust their valence in response to dopants.

3. The need to consider multiple potential reaction mechanisms that may occur simultaneously at different dopant sites.

While the study focuses on HVDs in ZnO, it suggests that similar behavior may be observed in other oxide systems doped with higher-valence cations, particularly when the host cations have a single stable oxidation state.

高价态掺杂剂（HVDs）如Ti和Al在ZnO中影响催化性能的方式包括：

1. 增加附近氧原子的结合能，使氧的移除更加困难，从而抑制传统的Mars-van Krevelen（MVK）氧化途径。

2. 创造配位不饱和位点，这些位点易于吸附和活化气相氧，促进替代氧化机制。

3. 实现新的反应途径，如吸附的O2直接与CO等反应物反应。

计算研究为这些机制提供了见解，而实验证实了HVD掺杂的ZnO相比未掺杂ZnO具有增强的CO氧化催化活性。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的挑战包括：

1. 掺杂剂价态、宿主氧化物可还原性和Lewis酸碱相互作用之间的复杂关系。

2. 宿主阳离子调整其价态以响应掺杂剂的能力（或无能力）。

3. 需要考虑可能在不同掺杂位点同时发生的多种潜在反应机制。

虽然该研究集中于ZnO中的HVDs，但它表明在其他被高价态阳离子掺杂的氧化物系统中可能观察到类似行为，特别是当宿主阳离子具有单一稳定氧化态时。
