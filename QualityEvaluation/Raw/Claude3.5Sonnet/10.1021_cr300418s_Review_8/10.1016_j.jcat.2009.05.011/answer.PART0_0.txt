[1] "We use theory to identify energetically favored reaction pathways. We calculate the activation energy only for the most important steps: the reaction of CO with the adsorbed O2 molecule and the formation of an oxygen vacancy by transfer of an oxygen atom from the surface onto the dopant."

[2] "In previous calculations [50], we have found that doping ZnO with Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, or W increases substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the oxide; Al, Mg, Ca, La, Re, Os and Ce have a similar, but less pronounced, effect."

[3] "The fact that the oxygen atoms near the dopant bind more strongly to the oxide indicates that the dopant is undercoordinated. This would imply that such a dopant will adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy its need for a higher coordination."

[4] "We have used solgel synthesis to attempt the preparation of high-surface-area ZnO atomically doped with Al or Ti. We have chosen to work with Ti, Al and Zn because TiO2, Al2O3, or ZnO does not oxidize CO at temperatures below 450 C, where we perform our experiments."

[5] "We propose and demonstrate two CO oxidation pathways that are different from the traditional MVK mechanism. We have shown that cationic substitutional doping of ZnO with Ti or Al promotes adsorption of O2 on the dopant. Essentially, this happens because Ti and Al have a higher valence than Zn."

The study provides insights into how high-valence dopants (HVDs) like Ti and Al influence the catalytic properties of ZnO for CO oxidation:

1. Computational studies revealed that HVDs like Ti and Al increase the energy required to form oxygen vacancies on the ZnO surface, indicating stronger binding of oxygen atoms near the dopant.

2. HVDs are undercoordinated when substituting Zn atoms, leading to enhanced adsorption of O2 from the gas phase to satisfy their higher valence.

3. Experimental results showed that Ti- and Al-doped ZnO catalysts were active for CO oxidation at lower temperatures compared to pure ZnO, TiO2, or Al2O3.

4. Two novel CO oxidation pathways different from the traditional Mars-van Krevelen mechanism were proposed and demonstrated for HVD-doped ZnO.

The study focused primarily on HVDs and did not provide direct comparisons with same-valence dopants (SVDs). Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior were not explicitly discussed in the given excerpts. The study mainly considered ZnO as the host oxide, limiting generalizations to other metal oxide systems.

该研究提供了关于高价掺杂剂（HVDs）如Ti和Al如何影响ZnO对CO氧化的催化性能的见解：

1. 计算研究表明，像Ti和Al这样的HVDs增加了在ZnO表面形成氧空位所需的能量，表明掺杂剂附近的氧原子结合更强。

2. 当取代Zn原子时，HVDs处于配位不足状态，导致增强了从气相吸附O2以满足其更高的价态。

3. 实验结果表明，Ti和Al掺杂的ZnO催化剂在较低温度下对CO氧化具有活性，相比纯ZnO、TiO2或Al2O3。

4. 对HVD掺杂的ZnO提出并证实了两种不同于传统Mars-van Krevelen机制的新型CO氧化途径。

该研究主要关注HVDs，没有提供与同价掺杂剂（SVDs）的直接比较。在给出的摘录中没有明确讨论制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战。该研究主要考虑ZnO作为宿主氧化物，限制了对其他金属氧化物系统的概括。
