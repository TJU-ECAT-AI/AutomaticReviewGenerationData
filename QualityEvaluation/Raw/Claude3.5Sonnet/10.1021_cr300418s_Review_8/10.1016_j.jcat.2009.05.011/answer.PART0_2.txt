[1] "We have chosen to work with Ti, Al and Zn because TiO2, Al2O3, or ZnO does not oxidize CO at temperatures below 450 C, where we perform our experiments."

[2] "Using a combination of theory and experiments, we show that ZnO substitutionally doped with Ti or Al oxidizes CO by several parallel reaction pathways that differ from the traditional Marsvan Krevelen (MVK) mechanism."

[3] "In previous calculations [50], we have found that doping ZnO with Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, or W increases substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the oxide; Al, Mg, Ca, La, Re, Os and Ce have a similar, but less pronounced, effect."

[4] "We speculate that numerous other oxides doped with cations having a higher valence than the host will behave like the present system in oxidation reactions, especially if the cation in the host is not able to reduce its valence when the dopant is present."

The literature provides insights into how high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, specifically ZnO:

1. HVDs like Ti and Al in ZnO create new reaction pathways for CO oxidation that differ from the traditional Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

2. Doping ZnO with HVDs (Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, W) increases the energy required to form oxygen vacancies at the oxide surface. This effect is less pronounced for Al, Mg, Ca, La, Re, Os, and Ce.

3. HVDs in ZnO promote O2 adsorption on the dopant site, leading to enhanced catalytic activity for CO oxidation at lower temperatures compared to undoped ZnO.

4. The behavior observed in Ti- and Al-doped ZnO may be applicable to other oxide systems where the dopant has a higher valence than the host cation, especially if the host cation cannot reduce its valence in response to the dopant.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The complexity of interactions between dopants, host oxide, and reactants.
2. The influence of the host oxide's reducibility on dopant effects.
3. The need to consider factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the specific nature of the host oxide.

The literature does not provide direct information on same-valence dopants (SVDs) or their comparison to HVDs in this context.

文献提供了高价掺杂剂(HVDs)如何影响金属氧化物催化性能的见解，特别是ZnO:

1. Ti和Al等HVDs在ZnO中创造了不同于传统Mars-van Krevelen机制的CO氧化新反应途径。

2. 用HVDs（Ti、V、Zr、Nb、Hf、Ta、W）掺杂ZnO会增加在氧化物表面形成氧空位所需的能量。Al、Mg、Ca、La、Re、Os和Ce的这种效果不太明显。

3. ZnO中的HVDs促进了O2在掺杂位点的吸附，与未掺杂的ZnO相比，在较低温度下表现出增强的CO氧化催化活性。

4. 在Ti和Al掺杂的ZnO中观察到的行为可能适用于其他氧化物系统，其中掺杂剂的价态高于主体阳离子，特别是当主体阳离子不能因应掺杂剂而降低其价态时。

制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战包括：

1. 掺杂剂、主体氧化物和反应物之间相互作用的复杂性。
2. 主体氧化物的可还原性对掺杂剂效果的影响。
3. 需要考虑诸如Lewis酸碱相互作用和主体氧化物的特定性质等因素。

文献没有提供关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)或其与HVDs比较的直接信息。
