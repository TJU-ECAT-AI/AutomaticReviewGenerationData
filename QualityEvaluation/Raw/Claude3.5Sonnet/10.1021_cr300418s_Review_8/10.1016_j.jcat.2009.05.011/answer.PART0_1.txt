[1] "We use theory to identify energetically favored reaction pathways. We calculate the activation energy only for the most important steps: the reaction of CO with the adsorbed O2 molecule and the formation of an oxygen vacancy by transfer of an oxygen atom from the surface onto the dopant."

[2] "In previous calculations [50], we have found that doping ZnO with Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, or W increases substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the oxide; Al, Mg, Ca, La, Re, Os and Ce have a similar, but less pronounced, effect."

[3] "The fact that the oxygen atoms near the dopant bind more strongly to the oxide indicates that the dopant is undercoordinated. This would imply that such a dopant will adsorb oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy its need for a higher coordination."

[4] "We propose and demonstrate two CO oxidation pathways that are different from the traditional MVK mechanism. We have shown that cationic substitutional doping of ZnO with Ti or Al promotes adsorption of O2 on the dopant. Essentially, this happens because Ti and Al have a higher valence than Zn."

[5] "We believe that the fact that the dopant has a higher valence than Zn explains qualitatively the behavior of the doped oxide. There is, however, a second relevant factor: the Zn atoms do not adjust its valence to respond to the presence of a dopant; in the ZnOTi groups present on the surface, Zn will stay divalent."

The literature provides insights into how high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly ZnO:

1. HVDs like Ti and Al in ZnO increase the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation at the surface, indicating stronger binding of oxygen atoms near the dopant.

2. This stronger binding suggests that the dopant is undercoordinated, leading to increased adsorption of oxygen from the gas phase to satisfy its higher coordination needs.

3. The higher valence of dopants like Ti and Al compared to Zn promotes O2 adsorption on the dopant, enabling new CO oxidation pathways different from the traditional Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism.

4. The behavior of the doped oxide is explained by two factors: the higher valence of the dopant and the inability of Zn atoms to adjust their valence in response to the dopant's presence.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) plays a role, as exemplified by the difference between ZnO and CuO when doped with Ti.

2. The stability of the host cation's oxidation state affects the dopant's influence on catalytic properties.

3. Lewis acid-base interactions are not explicitly discussed in the given literature, indicating a potential area for further investigation.

The study combines computational and experimental approaches to gain these insights, using density functional theory calculations to identify energetically favorable reaction pathways and experimental techniques to validate the proposed mechanisms.

文献提供了有关高价掺杂剂（HVDs）如何影响金属氧化物（特别是ZnO）的催化性能的见解：

1. ZnO中的高价掺杂剂（如Ti和Al）增加了表面氧空位形成所需的能量，表明掺杂剂附近的氧原子结合更强。

2. 这种更强的结合表明掺杂剂配位不足，导致从气相吸附更多氧气以满足其更高的配位需求。

3. 与Zn相比，Ti和Al等掺杂剂的价态更高，促进了掺杂剂上的O2吸附，从而实现了不同于传统Mars-van Krevelen（MVK）机制的新CO氧化途径。

4. 掺杂氧化物的行为可以通过两个因素解释：掺杂剂的高价态和Zn原子无法调整其价态以响应掺杂剂的存在。

制定掺杂剂行为通用预测规则的挑战包括：

1. 宿主氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）起着重要作用，如Ti掺杂的ZnO和CuO之间的差异所示。

2. 宿主阳离子氧化态的稳定性影响掺杂剂对催化性能的影响。

3. 给定文献中未明确讨论Lewis酸碱相互作用，表明这是一个潜在的进一步研究领域。

该研究结合了计算和实验方法来获得这些见解，使用密度泛函理论计算来识别能量上有利的反应途径，并使用实验技术来验证所提出的机制。
