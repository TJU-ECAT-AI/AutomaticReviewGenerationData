Abstract
A series of CexTi1-xO2 mixed oxide materials was synthesized by a solgel method with x varying from 0.1 to 0.9 and characterized by XRD, Raman, and TPR techniques. The structure of the mixed oxides changes with the Ce/Ti ratio. When the x value is decreased from 1.0 to 0.6 for CexTi1-xO2, only a cubic phase is detected, and the lattice parameter of the cubic phase decreases because of the formation of a solid solution by substituting Ti atoms into a CeO2 lattice. When x = 0.3, a new phase is observed. The structure of this new phase was characterized by Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction data. This mixed oxide adopts the monoclinic symmetry with the space group C2/m and a = 0.9811(8) nm, b = 0.3726(3) nm, c = 0.6831(6) nm, and β = 118.84. When x = 0.4 and 0.5, a mixed phase region is detected. The addition of Ti atoms into CeO2 significantly improves the storage capacity of mobile oxygen of CeO2 by increasing the reduction extent of the mixed oxides. When x = 0.30.6, the valence value of Ce after a TPR run is estimated to be close to +3, which obviously is smaller than that for reduced CeO2 alone. The Ce0.5Ti0.5O2 sample shows the highest capacity of storage oxygen among CexTi1-xO2 mixed oxides. The capacity for reoxidation of the reduced CeO2-rich solid solution is higher than that of CeO2-lean mixed oxides. CexTi1-xO2 mixed oxides are promising materials for oxygen storage as well as catalysts for many reactions involving oxygen, such as the catalysts for a three-way reaction to reduce the pollutant emissions or combustion of volatile organic compounds.

1. Introduction
Ceria (CeO2) has been extensively studied in recent years because of its wide applications in many areas of chemistry. In catalysis, for example, CeO2 has been used as an important component of automotive three-way catalysts (TWCs) for reducing the exhaust pollutants. The main roles of ceria in three-way catalysis are to promote the noble metal dispersion, (1) increase the thermal stability of the Al2O3 support, (2,3) promote CO oxidation and watergas shift reaction, (46) and store/release oxygen as an oxygen reservoir. (710) Among these functions, the most important property of CeO2 is as an oxygen reservoir, which stores and releases oxygen via the redox shift between Ce4+ and Ce3+ under oxidizing and reducing conditions, respectively. However, a major drawback of CeO2 is the loss of oxygen storage capability (OSC) due to its sintering at higher temperatures, which leads to the deactivation of the catalyst. (11) Therefore, a great number of CeO2-based mixed oxide systems (e.g., CeO2Al2O3, (12) CeO2SiO2, (13) CeO2La2O3, (12) CeO2HfO2, (14) and CeO2ZrO2 (15)) have been investigated with the aim to increase the thermal stability and the OSC of CeO2. Many studies have shown that the redox properties can be considerably enhanced if additional elements are introduced into the CeO2 lattice and solid solutions are formed. (15)
Among the CeO2-containing solid solutions, special attention has been focused on the CeO2ZrO2 solid solution because this material has been found to be very important to the three-way catalyst for eliminating the exhaust gases. From the reported results, the CeO2ZrO2 solid solution shows enhanced thermal stability, (16) redox, (1719) and catalytic properties (14,20) compared to single ceria. The CeO2ZrO2 mixed oxides have been shown to have high structural stability and oxygen storage capability over a wide range of ceria content. However, few studies were reported on other CeO2-containing materials.
The aim of this work is to synthesize new CeO2-containing materials and to investigate their structure and catalytic properties. In this article, we present one of the examples of our trial, CexTi1-xO2 mixed oxides, which shows a very high capability for oxygen storage and is a promising new material for three-way catalysis or other forms of catalysis for oxidation reactions.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Preparation of CexTi1-xO2 Mixed Oxides. CexTi1-xO2 (x = 01.0 with an interval of 0.1) mixed oxide samples were prepared by the solgel method. A solution of Ti[O(CH2)3CH3]4 and ethanol was added to another solution of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and ethanol under stirring. The solution was slowly gelled after finishing the reaction between Ti[O(CH2)3CH3]4 and H2O. The gel was dried at 100 C under stirring and then calcined at 650 C for 4 h.
2.2. X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD). XRD patterns were collected on a Rigaku Rotaflex (RU-200B) powder diffractometer equipped with a Cu target and a Ni grating monochromatic system. The working voltage of the instrument was 40 kV and the current was 50 mA. The mean crystallite size of the cubic phase was calculated from the Scherrer equation, where the Scherrer constant (particle shape factor) was taken as 0.89. The lattice parameters were calculated by the least-squares method according to the Cohen procedure. (21) For the Ce0.3Ti0.7O2 sample, the XRD pattern was analyzed by the Rietvald method. (22)
2.3. Laser Raman Spectra. Visible laser Raman spectra were recorded on a Jobin Yvon double monochromator (U-1000) coupled to a photomutiplier tube (PMT) detector and the laser line at 532 nm was used as the excitation source.
2.4. Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR). TPR of the mixed oxides was carried out using 10% H2 in an Ar flow as the reducing agent. The amount of consumed H2 during the reduction was estimated on the basis of the analysis with a thermal conductivity detector. The gas flow rate was 30 mL/min. The weight of the sample was 25 mg, and the heating rate of TPR was 20 C/min. Water produced during TPR was trapped in a molecular sieve (5 Å). The extent of reduction was quantitatively calculated according to the TPR peak areas and the result was calibrated on the basis of the hydrogen consumption from the reduction of CuO to Cu. (19)
The sample after a TPR run was reoxidized and then a second TPR run was performed with the purpose of revealing the redox properties of the sample. The first TPR run was carried out up to 950 C, and subsequently, the sample was cooled to a desired temperature (100, 300, or 500 C) in the H2 atmosphere. Then, the reduced sample was exposed to air at 100, 300, or 500 C for 0.5 h. Finally, the sample was cooled to 50 C in air for the second TPR experiment.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Structural Characterization of CexTi1-xO2 Samples. Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of CexTi1-xO2 mixed oxides calcined at 650 C. Crystalline phases were identified by comparing with ICDD files (anatase TiO2, 21-1272; rutile TiO2. 21-1276; CeO2, 34-394). From Figure 1, mixed phases, rutile and anatase, are observed for TiO2, while only the anatase phase is observed for Ce0.1Ti0.9O2. This result means that the addition of a small amount of CeO2 into TiO2 inhibits the phase transition from anatase to rutile. This is a very interesting finding that the anatase phase can be stabilized in the presence of a small amount of CeO2 because rutile is known to be the most stable crystalline phase of TiO2. For the Ce0.3Ti0.7O2 sample, the diffraction peaks cannot be attributed to any known Ti-containing or Ce-contained mixed oxides according to the current available ICDD files. Therefore, the structure and lattice parameters for the Ce0.3Ti0.7O2 sample were determined by the Retiveld method. The agreement between the experimental and calculated powder X-ray diffraction pattern in the final refinement is shown in Figure 2. Good agreement is found between the experimental and calculated powder X-ray diffraction patterns. Ce0.3Ti0.7O2 exists mainly in a monoclinic phase belonging to the space group C2/m with the lattice parameters a = 0.9811(8) nm, b = 0.3726(3) nm, c = 0.6831(6) nm, and β = 118.84. For the Ce0.2Ti0.8O2 sample, the weak diffraction peaks of the anatase phase are observed, except for the diffraction peaks of Ce0.3Ti0.7O2. For Ce0.4Ti0.6O2 and Ce0.5Ti0.5O2 samples, both cubic and monoclinic phases are also observed. It is clear that the addition of CeO2 into TiO2 leads to the formation of a monoclinic phase. According to the above results, CexTi1-xO2 samples in the region 0.2  x  0.5 (see Table 2) are composed of mainly a mixed phase, a monoclinic phase, and a cubic (or anatase) phase except when x = 0.3. When x = 0.3, a nearly pure monoclinic phase is formed. When the content of CeO2 is increased up to x = 0.6, the cubic phase is dominant in the CexTi1-xO2 samples.

Table 1 lists the change in the lattice parameter and the mean crystallite size of the cubic phase of CexTi1-xO2 in the composition range 0.4  x  1.0. From Table 1, it can be seen that the lattice parameter of the cubic phase decreases with increasing Ti content. This means that the incorporation of Ti4+ ions into the ceria lattice can derive the solid solution of CexTi1-xO2 because the radius of Ti4+ ions (0.068 nm) is smaller than that of the Ce4+ ion (0.094 nm). The mean crystallite size of the cubic phase also decreases with increasing Ti content. This means that the substitution of Ti atoms into the CeO2 lattice inhibits the crystal growth of the cubic phase.
Figure 3 shows the Raman spectra of CexTi1-xO2 mixed oxides calcined at 650 C. There are a number of Raman bands observed at 142, 192, 234, 395, 443, 513, 608, and 634 cm-1 for TiO2, which are in good agreement with the Raman spectra of rutileanatase mixed oxides reported by Busca et al. (23) This result confirms that the TiO2 consists of rutile and anatase phases. The spectrum of the Ce0.1Ti0.9O2 sample resembles the spectral feature of anatase. For the Ce0.3Ti0.7O2 sample, however, some new Raman bands appear at 166, 192, 272, 332, 368, 485, 596, 640, and 765 cm-1. These Raman bands have never been reported in the literature before. According to the above XRD result, we believe that these new Raman peaks are attributed to the new compound with a monoclinic phase formed by substituting Ce atoms into the TiO2 lattice. However, CexTi1-xO2 (x = 0.71.0) samples give mainly a single sharp band at about 461 cm-1, which is due to the Raman active F2g mode of CeO2, the typical band of a fluorite structural material. The Raman spectra (Figure 3) are consistent with the XRD patterns (Figure 1) of CexTi1-xO2 samples.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Raman spectra of CexTi1-xO2 samples.
Table 2 lists the phase composition of CexTi1-xO2 mixed oxides on the basis of XPD and Raman results. Compared with the phase composition detected by the two techniques (XRD and Raman), two phases, cubic and monoclinic phase, are detected by Raman spectroscopy for the Ce0.6Ti0.4O2 sample, and only the cubic phase for the Ce0.6Ti0.4O2 sample is detected by XRD. This can be attributed to the following two reasons. One is that the X-ray penetrates the bulk of a crystalline particle while the visible laser may not be able to reach the bulk because the CexTi1-xO2 absorbs the visible light. So the Raman results may reflect more information from the surface region than XRD. It also indicates that the phase transformation starts at the surface region and then develops toward the bulk for CexTi1-xO2 samples. Another reason may be that the relative sensitivities of Raman spectroscopy and XRD are different for some phases.
3.2. Redox Properties. Figure 4 shows the TPR profiles of the CexTi1-xO2 mixed oxides. There are two reduction peaks at about 650 and 850 C in the TPR profiles for CexTi1-xO2 (x = 0.3), while there is only one peak at 680 C for the Ce0.2Ti0.8O2 sample and a weak overlapped peak for Ce0.1Ti0.9O2. TiO2 does not show an evident reduction peak in the temperature range from 100 to 950 C. The position of the low-temperature peak, 680 C, shifts to higher temperatures with increasing TiO2 content except for the Ce0.1Ti0.9O2 sample, while that of the high-temperature peak remains stable. The intensity of the low-temperature peak increases with increasing TiO2 content and reaches a maximum at x = 0.4. However, the change of the high-temperature peak is very complex. As the x value decreases from 1 to 0.6, the intensity of the high-temperature peak is reduced when x = 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 and this peak grows and becomes very sharp and its intensity reaches a maximum at x = 0.5. Two reduction peaks of CeO2 at about 570 and 850 C are associated with the stepwise reduction. The peak at 570 C is generally attributed to reduction in the surface region, and the peak at 860 C is ascribed to the reduction of bulk. From the relative area of the reduction peak of mixed oxides, the increase in peak area at about 650 C is attributed to mainly the increase of Ti content in CexTi1-xO2 solid solution. The sharp peak at 850 C for CexTi1-xO2 samples may be associated with the cubic phase.

Table 3 lists the H2 consumption of CexTi1-xO2 mixed oxides and the reduction degree of CeO2 in CexTi1-xO2, supposing that only the CeO2 component is reduced. The reduction extent of ceria is estimated from the H2 consumption of the CexTi1-xO2 sample. The H2 consumption of any CexTi1-xO2 mixed oxide is much higher than that of CeO2 alone. This means that the presence of TiO2 promotes the reduction of CeO2 or the presence of Ti ions weakens the CeO bond in the solid solution of CexTi1-xO2 and makes the CeO2 component more easily reduced. When x = 0.20.6, the valence value of Ce in the reduced sample of CexTi1-xO2 is estimated to be close to +3, which is much smaller than +3.8 for reduced CeO2. This indicates that the CexTi1-xO2 solid solution is a potential material with a much higher capability for storage of oxygen.

The redox behavior of CeO2TiO2 mixed oxides is an important feature because most catalysts used for the oxidation reaction are under the redox cycle; for example, a three-way catalyst works under redox conditions. Figures 5 and 6 show the repeated TPR cycles of Ce0.8Ti0.2O2 and Ce0.4Ti0.6O2 samples at different reoxidation temperatures. The TPR peaks become weaker after reoxidation. However, as the temperature of reoxidation treatment decreases, the position of the TPR peak does not change for the Ce0.8Ti0.2O2 sample, whereas it shifts to lower temperatures for the Ce0.4Ti0.6O2 sample. Comparing the peak areas of the fresh and reoxidized samples, we found that H2 consumption of the reoxidized sample at 500, 300, and 100 C is about 98, 80, and 80%, respectively, for the first TPR run of the Ce0.8Ti0.2O2 sample and is respectively about 90, 78, and 8% for the Ce0.4Ti0.6O2 sample. This indicates that the reduced Ce0.8Ti0.2O2 sample is easier to be reoxidized than the reduced Ce0.4Ti0.6O2 sample. It is worthwhile to notice that the high-temperature peak, 860 C, is not observed for the reoxidized sample. This indicates that the recovery of the high-temperature peak is difficult with redoxidation.

Figure 6
Figure 6. TPR profiles of the Ce0.4Ti0.6O2 sample and reduced sample reoxidized at different temperatures.
According to TPR results, we conclude that the introducing of TiO2 into CeO2 leads to the formation of solid solution CexTi1-xO2, enhances the reduction of bulk oxygen, and results in high efficiency of the Ce4+  Ce3+ redox cycle, especially, for a CeO2-rich solid solution. In other words, this redox cycle is easier in a cubic-dominant Ce0.8Ti0.2O2 sample than in the Ce0.6Ti0.4O2 sample, which is a mixture of cubic and monoclinic phases.
3.3. Phase Stability at Different Calcination Temperatures. Figures 7 and 8 show the XRD patterns of Ce0.8Ti0.2O2 and Ce03Ti0.7O2 calcined at different temperatures for 4 h. For the Ce0.8Ti0.2O2 sample (Figure 7), the cubic phase is already formed when the precursor was calcined at 350 C. However, as the calcination temperature increases, the diffraction peak becomes narrower, which means the crystallite size becomes larger due to the sample sintering. We also found that calcination at higher temperatures does not change the Raman spectra of Ce0.8Ti0.2O2, as confirmed by the XRD results. For the Ce03Ti0.7O2 sample, the structure of the precursor is still amorphous after calcination at 500 C (Figure 8). The diffraction peaks of the monoclinic phase are obviously observed after calcination at 650 C. However, when the calcination temperature is increased from 650 to 950 C, the position and relative intensity of diffraction peaks no longer change. This means that the monoclinic phase of Ce03Ti0.7O2 mixes oxides has been well derived after calcination at 650 C. This monoclinic phase is very stable in the temperature range from 650 to 950 C, and the change of the crystallite size is very small. Figures 9 and 10 show TPR profiles of Ce0.8Ti0.2O2 and Ce03Ti0.7O2 calcined at different temperatures. As the temperature increases, the peak of TPR shifts to higher temperatures, possibly because of the sintering of the samples.

4. Conclusions
A series of CexTi1-xO2 mixed oxides was synthesized by the solgel method. XRD and Raman results indicate that the solid solution of CexTi1-xO2 is formed via the incorporation of TiO2 into a CeO2 lattice. A solid solution of CexTi1-xO2 with a cubic phase is detected when x  0.6 and a mixture phase for x  0.5 samples. When x = 0.3, a monoclinic phase is observed with the space group C2/m and a = 0.9811(8) nm, b = 0.3726(3) nm, c = 0.6831(6) nm, and β = 118.84. The lattice parameter and the mean crystallite size of the cubic phase decreases with increasing Ti content. This means that the incorporation of the Ti ion into a CeO2 lattice inhibits the crystal growth of the cubic phase. The crystallite phases of CexTi1-xO2 are shown to be stable at calcination temperatures from 500 to 950 C.
The reduction degree of CexTi1-xO2 is greatly enhanced, owing to the introduction of Ti into a CeO2 lattice. For CexTi1-xO2 (x = 0.20.6) samples, the Ce4+ ions reduced at 950 C are estimated to be about Ce3+, while the reduction of CeO2 alone at 950 C can reach only Ce3.8+. The reduced CexTi1-xO2 mixed oxides can be easily oxidized, indicating that the new material possesses excellent redox properties. The CeO2-rich solid solution shows better oxygen storage than the CeO2-lean solid solution.
