Abstract
Doping of oxides is used to modify their catalytic properties. The question we address here is whether a dopant affects only the oxygen atom next to it or also the ones further away. We find that low-valence dopants (Na and Li dopants in MgO and La and Y dopants in CeO2) have both a long-range and a short-range effect. In contrast, Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Mo, and W dopants in CeO2(111) affect only the oxygen atoms next to them. Furthermore, these dopants lower the energy of making an oxygen vacancy next to them by roughly the same amount. This is puzzling because these dopants have vastly different dopantoxygen bond strength in their own oxide. By analyzing the electronic structure of the doped oxide and the changes caused by vacancy formation, we suggest that they have similar effects on vacancy formation energy because when they dope ceria, they become tetravalent, just like the Ce atom they replace.

Introduction
Oxides are used as catalysts for many oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The energy, ΔEv, required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide is sometimes used as a predictor of the ability of the oxide to perform oxidation reactions. ΔEv, and therefore, the catalytic activity, can be manipulated by doping, which consists of replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations. (1, 2) In the catalysis literature, it is tacitly assumed that the effect of a dopant is local; namely, it affects only the oxygen atoms in its proximity.
A different point of view was formulated in the literature on the electronic properties of oxides. (3-5) This uses a model in which the dopants are replaced by an electron reservoir whose thermodynamic properties are defined by its electrochemical potential, μ. If μ is large, the reservoir will transfer an electron to the oxide, when an oxygen vacancy is formed, creating a negatively charged vacancy. If μ is very small, the formation of the oxygen vacancy is accompanied by an electron transfer to the reservoir, and the vacancy is positively charged. For moderate values of μ, the vacancy is neutral. The energy of vacancy formation depends on its charge state. In this model, dopants change the Fermi energy, and this affects the energy of forming an oxygen vacancy.
This model has an intriguing consequence. The dopants are viewed as an electron reservoir whose properties are described by μ alone. The electrochemical potential is a global quantity: it is the same at all sites in the system. In particular, the dopants in this model will affect the energy of vacancy formation no matter where the vacancy is located with respect to the dopant.
It is reasonable to assume that the two pictures coexist. To test whether this is the case, we have calculated the energy, ΔEv, for forming an oxygen vacancy in the surface layer for two dopant positions: one near the site where the oxygen vacancy is formed and one away from it. If a dopant does not have a global effect, the energy of forming a vacancy far from the dopant will be equal to that of forming a vacancy on the undoped oxide. If there is no local effect, ΔEv for forming a vacancy next to the dopant is equal to the energy of forming a vacancy away from it. If both effects are present, the energy of forming a vacancy near the dopant is different from the energy of forming a vacancy away from the dopant, and both are different from the energy of forming a vacancy on the surface of the undoped oxide.
To test which one of these alternatives takes place, we calculated the energy of vacancy formation near the dopant and away from it for CeO2(111) doped with Y, La, Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W, and for MgO(001) doped with Li, Na, Ca, Ga, Al, Y, and Sc. The oxygen vacancy is formed on the surface; the dopant is either on the surface next to the vacancy or inside the slab at the largest distance from the vacancy allowed by the supercell used in the calculations.
The effect of substitutional doping of ceria on the chemistry of the surface has been studied previously, by density functional theory, for the following dopants: Pd, (6-8) Al, (9) Sc, (9) Y, (9) Ta, (10) Nb, (10) La, (11, 12) Zr, (8, 13, 14) Ir, (15) Cu, (16) Ni, (17) Au, (18-20) Ti, (14) Hf, (14) and Pt. (21) We are not aware of any systematic study of the dependence of the energy of vacancy formation on the distance between the vacancy and the dopant.
The methods used in the present calculations are explained in section 2. Section 3 presents results on the energy of vacancy formation near and away from the dopant. We find that the low-valence dopants (La and Y for CeO2 and Li and Na for MgO) have both a long-range and a short-range effect. High-valence dopants (Al, Sc, and Y) in MgO(001) slightly increase the energy of vacancy formation next to them, with the exception of Ga, which behaves differently because it is reduced when the vacancy is formed. Al, Sc, and Y dopants in MgO(001) have a very small long-range effect on vacancy formation due to the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged vacancy and the positively charged dopant. Doping CeO2(111) with Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W has no long-range effect on the energy of vacancy formation. In addition, these dopants affect the energy of vacancy formation next to them by roughly the same amount, even though the dopants have very different chemical properties. For example, the heats of formation of the oxides made by the dopants are extremely different, but their effect on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation (when used as dopants) is almost the same. One common feature of these dopants is that their bond to oxygen, in their own oxide, is much shorter than the bond between Ce and oxygen in CeO2. This suggests that the dopants have difficulties making strong bonds with the oxygen atoms of ceria.
Section 4 examines the projected density of states (PDOS) of the doped oxides before and after an oxygen vacancy is made in the surface. We find a great diversity in the electronic structure of these systems and in the manner in which they react when a vacancy is formed. A particularly intriguing feature is that W and Mo dopants reduce two Ce atoms and are left with only four valence electrons; Ta and Nb reduce one Ce atom and are also left with four valence electrons. We speculate that Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W dopants have a similar effect on the energy of vacancy formation because they are all effectively tetravalent, like the Ce atom they replace.
Methodology
The p(3 × 3) supercell used in calculations on the CeO2(111) surface is shown in Figure 1. It consists of 9 atomic layers (3 stoichiometric CeO2 layers with 81 atoms) and a vacuum layer of 15 Å. Its dimensions are 11.45 × 11.45 × (31/2/2) × 22.79 Å3. The figure also indicates the position of the dopant and that of the oxygen atom that will be removed to make an oxygen vacancy. In Figure 1a the vacancy is near the dopant, in Figure 1b it is as far as the supercell allows (9 Å). The supercell used for the calculation on MgO(001) is shown in Figure 2, which also indicates the positions of the dopant and where the oxygen vacancy is made.

All calculations were performed with the VASP package (22-26) with the PAW (26, 27) pseudopotential. The pseudopotentials used in the calculations are [Kr4d]5s25p64f15d16s2 for Ce, [Kr4d] 5s25p65d16s2 for La, [Ar3d4s]4p64d55s1 for Mo, [Ar3d4s]4p64d45s1 for Nb, [He]2s22p4 for O, [Xe4f]5d96s1 for Pt, [Kr]4d75s1 for Ru, [Kr4d5s]5p65d46s1 for Ta, [Kr4d5s]5p65d56s1 for W, [Ar3d]4s24p64d15s2 for Y, and [Ar3d]4s24p64d25s2 for Zr. A Γ-centered 2 × 2 × 1 k-point mesh and 400 eV energy cutoff off were used. During geometry optimization, only the bottom oxygen layer is fixed, and the other 8 layers are free to relax until the force on each atom is less than 0.02 eV/Å. The total energy convergence criteria are 104 eV for geometry optimization and 105 eV for the single-point energy calculation.
It is widely believed (28-32) that the DFT + U method provides a better description of oxygen-vacancy formation than does GGA-DFT. In this article, we perform DFT + U calculations on the doped ceria surface under the approximation given by Dudarev (33) et al., as implemented in the VASP package. (22-26) We use the LDA functional with a U value of 5.5 eV because it gives the energy of the reaction CeO2  Ce2O3 + 1/2 O2, and the lattice constants for CeO2 are in agreement with experimental data. (30, 31) Fitting this reaction is sensible because it is a formal reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, a process that is believed to occur when a vacancy is formed. This value or one close to it has been used in other works on ceria. Nevertheless, one should keep in mind that there is no rigorous procedure for choosing a value for U. We believe that our qualitative conclusions (i.e., local versus global, etc.) are not changed if we use another reasonable value for U.
When an oxygen vacancy is made, two electrons that were engaged in the bonds between the removed oxygen atom and the surface are left unpaired in the oxide. Pirovano, Sauer, and da Silva (28) and Peijun Hus group (29) have shown that these two unpaired electrons can make polarons localized on two Ce atoms. The vacancy-formation energy depends on the location of these polarons. A similar behavior was proposed (34-36) and detected (37) for the unpaired electrons produced when making oxygen vacancies at the surface of rutile TiO2. In the case of TiO2, the position of the polarons can substantially change the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation. We have examined a few polaron locations when an oxygen vacancy is made in doped ceria and found the effect of their location to be small (0.20.3 eV). Our goal is to find whether the effect of the dopant on the energy of vacancy formation is local, global, or both. The precise position of the polarons does not affect the answer to this qualitative question. By doing a calculation on the MgO surface, we avoided the polaron problem and got the same trend.
After the work presented here was completed, we found that Ru-doped ceria has a structure whose energy is lower by 0.2 eV than that of the structure studied here. We believe that this difference in geometry does not affect the qualitative conclusions drawn here.
The Bader charges on the dopants were calculated by using the method proposed by Henkelman and co-workers. (38, 39) In this article, we give (see Table 1) what we call the Bader valence of the dopant, which is the number of electrons the dopant donates to the oxide.

aThe dopant was in the top layer, and the vacancy was made near the dopant. The dopant was in the bottom layer, and the oxygen vacancy was made on the surface, as far from the dopant as possible (9 Å). The Bader valence equals the total electron charge donated by the dopant (Bader charge of the atom minus the Bader charge on the dopant in ceria), when the dopant is in the top layer and the surface has no vacancy.
To explore the relationship between the Fermi level and the energy for forming an oxygen vacancy on the doped surface, we calculate the work function, WF, from
where χ is the electrostatic potential in the vacuum at a sufficiently large distance from the surface, and εf is the Fermi level given by the VASP output.
All DFT calculations were spin-polarized. The energy difference between different spin states is 0.2 eV or less. These differences are too small to affect the qualitative results reported here.
Effect of the Dopants on the Energy of Oxygen-Vacancy Formation
Introduction
The energy ΔEv of oxygen-vacancy formation is defined by
where Er is the energy of the oxide slab with one oxygen vacancy in the top layer of the supercell, E[O2(g)] is the energy of an O2 molecule in the gas phase, and Es is the energy of the slab without an oxygen vacancy. The calculated values of ΔEv are given in Tables 1 and 2.

aNear means that the dopant is in the surface layer, and the vacancy is next to it. Far means that the dopant is in the third layer, and the vacancy is in the top layer as far from the dopant as the supercell allows.
In previous work, (40) we have found it useful to introduce the concepts of low-valence dopant (LVD) and high-valence dopant (HVD). An LVD is a dopant whose valence is lower than that of the cation it substitutes in the host oxide. An HVD is a dopant whose valence is higher. The definition of valence in this context needs to be specified clearly. For example, the valence of La is III because it makes only one stable oxide, La2O3. We ignore the possibility that La is divalent, even though some compounds with divalent La are known. We are only interested in the valence of a cation in its own stable oxides. Therefore, when used as a dopant in ceria, La is a LVD, and so is Y. The only stable oxide of Ta is Ta2O5, and therefore, Ta is a pentavalent dopant, and when used to dope ceria, it is an HVD. Nb is multivalent because Nb2O5, NbO2, and NbO are stable. It is, therefore, difficult to know a priori whether a Nb dopant in ceria should be considered low-valence or high-valence, and we call such dopants flexible-valence dopants (FVDs).
As we explain below, we have chosen the dopants of ceria to determine whether their effect on the energy of vacancy formation follows simple rules based on the strength of their bond to oxygen and on their valence (in their own oxides). It is reasonable to assume that a dopant that substitutes a Ce atom will attempt to bind the neighboring oxygen atoms to form a structure similar to that of one of its stable oxides and that its ability to affect the nearby oxygen atoms correlates with the strength of the dopantoxygen bond in the dopants oxide. Because of this, we wanted to examine dopants having different valence, whose oxides have a large difference in stability (as estimated from the heat of formation per cation). Pt has two unstable oxides, PtO3 and PtO2; therefore, a priori it might attempt to be either tetravalent or hexavalent as a dopant. This is to be compared to W and to Mo, which make tetravalent or hexavalent oxides that have much higher stability than those of Pt. One would therefore think that it is much easier to make an oxygen vacancy in the ceria surface near the Pt dopant than near the W or Mo dopant. This is not what the DFT calculations find.
Ru makes only one stable solid oxide, RuO2, and this can be compared to Zr, which is also tetravalent but makes a much more stable oxide. We expected to find that making a vacancy near the Ru dopant is much easier than near Zr. This is not what the DFT calculations find.
Finally, Ta makes a pentavalent oxide that is very stable, and we compare it to Nb, which makes Nb2O5 but also NbO2 and NbO. We wanted to see if the ability of the dopant to have more than one valence, when it makes an oxide, does affect its influence on the oxygen-vacancy formation.
It is also important to keep in mind that Ce can readily adjust its valence in response to changes in conditions; besides Ce2O3 and CeO2, the following oxides are stable (41) under various oxygen pressures and temperatures: CeO1.714, CeO1.778, CeO1.800, and CeO1.818. Moreover, making an oxygen vacancy reduces two cerium atoms, and making a hydroxyl on the surface reduces one Ce atom. All these indicate that the redox chemistry of the ceria surface is affected by the ability of Ce cations to accept electrons. Since we suspected that this reducibility is important, we also examined MgO, which is not reducible. For MgO, we have looked at LVDs (Li and Na) and HVDs (Al, Ga, Sc, and Y) as well as Ca, which is very similar to Mg. We find that the effect of the dopant on the oxygen-vacancy formation in MgO is predictable on the basis of a dopants valence. This is not the case for ceria. The effect of high-valence dopants on the oxygen-vacancy formation depends qualitatively on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible.
Effect of Low Valence Dopants
The LVDs studied in this work are La and Y dopants in ceria and Li and Na in magnesia. As was shown in previous work, (40, 42, 43) the LVDs diminish by a substantial amount the energy of making an oxygen vacancy next to them. All LVDs we studied here affect the energy of vacancy formation even when the vacancy is made far from the dopant. For example, doping ceria with La lowers the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation from 3.00 eV, for undoped ceria, to 1.35 eV when the vacancy is near the dopant, and to 1.63 eV when the vacancy is at the largest distance from the dopant (see Table 1). A similar behavior is observed for MgO doped with Li or Na (see Table 2).
Having a lower valence than the cation it substitutes, an LVD creates an electron deficit in the system, and this weakens the bond of the electrophilic oxygen atoms to the surface. It is therefore tempting to think that the main effect of an LVD on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation far from the dopant is due to the presence of this electron deficit. To test this idea we calculated the energy of vacancy formation in an undoped slab from which we removed one electron from the supercell. The energy of vacancy formation in the charged MgO slab is 3.60 eV, which is very close to the value of 3.59 eV for the doped MgO surface (with Li or Na) when the vacancy is made far from the dopant. The energy of vacancy formation for the charged CeO2 slab is 1.40 eV, which is not very different from the values of 1.63 eV and 1.74 eV for CeO2 doped with La and Y, respectively. The slight difference may be attributed to the fact that ceria is a reducible oxide.
Ceria doped with LVDs (i.e., La or Y) has a very high work function, especially when compared to the work function of the other doped surfaces (see Table 1). This is consistent with the fact that these LVDs create a hole at the top of the valence band (see section 4). This is reminiscent of the long-range model; the dopant lowers the Fermi level, and when the vacancy is formed, one of the unpaired electrons produced by removing the oxygen atom fills the hole, thus lowering the energy of vacancy formation. In the presence of an LVD, the vacancy produces only one unpaired electron.
Effect of High Valence Dopants in MgO(001)
In previous work (42) on vacancy formation in doped ZnO, we have found that high-valence dopants (in this case, dopants whose valence is higher than that of Zn) increase the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation next to the dopant. This may be attributed to the fact that such dopants are undercoordinated and bind the nearby oxygen atoms more strongly to the surface. We see the same trend in the case of doped MgO, which is, like ZnO, an irreducible oxide. However, the increase of ΔEv upon doping MgO with HVDs is not as pronounced as on ZnO because the oxygen in MgO is very strongly bound to the oxide; there is little room for increasing this binding energy. Nevertheless, Al, Sc, and Y, which are all trivalent, manage to cause a slight increase in the energy for making an oxygen vacancy next to them.
The effect of the Ga dopant in MgO(001) goes counter to the rules we have observed so far; the energy to make a vacancy next to this HVD is lower than the energy of vacancy formation on the undoped magnesia. A possible explanation is provided by the change in the Bader charge on Ga when an oxygen vacancy is made on the surface of Ga-doped MgO. In the absence of a vacancy, the Bader valence of the Ga dopant is 1.17 electrons. This drops to 0.45 when an oxygen vacancy is made near the Ga dopant. This is a very large change, indicating that Ga is reduced when the vacancy is made; some of the charge density of the unpaired electrons created by the removal of an oxygen atom moves onto the Ga, and this lowers the energy to make the vacancy.
It is interesting to see in Table 2 that all trivalent dopants (i.e., Al, Ga, Sc, and Y) in MgO have a small long-range effect: the energy to make a vacancy far from the dopant is 6.27 eV, for all of them. This value is larger than the 6.15 eV required for making a vacancy on the undoped magnesia. The fact that all these dopants have the same long-range effect suggests a physical cause (as opposed to some form of chemical bonding). When an oxygen vacancy is made in an irreducible oxide, such as MgO or La2O3, the unpaired electrons are localized at the vacancy site. (40, 43) Because we replaced a divalent cation with a trivalent dopant, the dopant site is likely to have a negative charge. We propose that the additional energy (i.e., 6.276.15 eV) is due to the electrostatic repulsion between the unpaired electrons in the vacancy and a positive charge created by the presence of the dopant.
Effect of Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W on the Energy of Vacancy Formation in the Surface Layer, Far from the Dopant
We found that these dopants do not affect the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at a large distance (Table 1). The model used in the semiconductor literature to determine the effect of a dopant assumes that the main function of the dopant is to provide an electron reservoir whose chemical potential (Fermi energy) can influence the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation. Because of this, we looked for a correlation between the change in the Fermi level caused by doping and the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation away from the dopant. The work functions of the doped ceria vary between 4.8 and 5.97 eV (see Table 1), while the effect of these dopants on vacancy formation away from the dopant is practically zero. Obviously, the two quantities are not correlated.
Pt is the only dopant of ceria (besides La and Y, which are LVDs) that has a slight effect at a large distance. As we show later, it is likely that this is caused by the fact that the formation of a vacancy reduces Pt (transfers some electron charge on it). This long-range effect does not seem related to the Fermi level in Pt-doped CeO2(111) even though its low value (the work function is 5.78 eV) seems consistent with the long-range model. However, the Fermi level in Zr-doped ceria is lower, and Zr has no long-range effect on ΔEv.
The fact that these dopants have no long-range effect, even though they do change the Fermi level, does not invalidate the long-range model. In this model, the dependence of the energy of vacancy formation on the Fermi level is a staircase function: the vacancy is negative for a certain range of the Fermi level, neutral in another range, and positive in another. Each of these ranges corresponds to a different energy of vacancy formation. It is possible that the dopants used here do not span a broad enough range of Fermi energy to display the effect predicted by the long-range model.
Effect of Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W on the Energy of Vacancy Formation in the Surface Layer, Near the Dopant
In undertaking this work, we were hoping to discover a way of predicting a priori the effect of a dopant by using some of its properties known from experiments. In the past, we found a linear relationship between the energy of vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide made by the dopant (43) (for La2O3 doped with a few LVDs). We do not find such regularities in the case of the reducible cerium oxide doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, or W. The dopants in this list have very different chemical properties (see Table 3), but they lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation by roughly the same amount (Table 1). Table 3 gives the heat of formation of the oxide of each dopant divided by the number of atoms in the oxides formula. For example, for La2O3 or Nb2O5 the table gives the enthalpy of formation in Joules per mole, divided by 2. We also show the same enthalpy divided by the coordination number of the dopant in its most stable oxide. Neither of these quantities correlates with the effect of the dopant on the energy of vacancy formation next to it. The two Pt oxides, PtO3 and PtO2, are barely stable, and the Ru oxides decompose easily. On the other hand, Ta and Nb oxides are remarkably stable. Nevertheless, when these atoms are used to dope ceria they change the energy of vacancy formation by roughly the same amount. This indicates that the bond between the dopant and the surrounding oxygen atoms is dramatically different from that between the oxygen and the dopant in its own oxide. This unusual behavior is not predicated on the dopant being able to have a variety of valence states when it makes an oxide. For example, Nb makes three stable oxides, while Ta and Zr make only one stable oxide, but their effect on oxygen-vacancy formation when doping ceria is about the same. Furthermore, the valence of the dopant seems irrelevant: the effect of doping with Zr, which is tetravalent, is almost the same as doping with Ta, which is pentavalent.

aΔHf is the heat of formation per mole of oxide multiplied by 1 and divided by the number of cations in the chemical formula (e.g., for La2O3 we divide by 2, the heat of formation of one mole of oxide); co is the coordination number in the bulk oxide; ΔHf/co is the negative of the heat of formation per mole of oxide divided by the coordination number; DO is the distance between the dopant in the surface layer of CeO2(111) and the oxygen next to it (that is removed when the oxygen vacancy is formed); L1, L2, and L3 are the bond lengths between the cation and oxygen in the bulk oxide. Data is from Holleman and Wiberg (44) and from the CRC Handbook. (45) The DO distances have been calculated in the present work. The L1, L2, and L3 distances were calculated from published experimental lattice constants (see http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS/periodictable.php and http://database.iem.ac.ru/mincryst/search.php?select=Formula).
There is one factor that Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W dopants have in common: the dopantoxygen bonds in their own oxides are much shorter than the CeO bond in ceria (see Table 3). When a dopant in this list replaces a Ce atom, it finds that the oxygen atoms are too far, and it cannot make a strong bond with them. Consider for example Zr-doped ceria. The enthalpy of formation of CeO2 is comparable to that of ZrO2 (see Table 3). Zr makes only a tetravalent oxide; therefore, there is little chance that it will change its valence when it replaces a Ce atom. In addition, there are three phases of ZrO2 and one of them has the fluoride structure just like ceria. On the basis of these energetic and structural similarities, one would expect that replacing a Ce atom in ceria with Zr would not have a large effect on the binding of the surface oxygen atoms to ceria. However, the effect of Zr dopant is large: ΔEv is lowered by 0.8 eV. Let us now examine the possible effect of the bond length on this system. The longest ZrO bond in ZrO2 is 2.18 Å (Table 3), while the CeO bond in ceria is 2.33 Å long. Table 3 also gives the distance between the Zr dopant and the oxygen atom removed when the vacancy is formed on the surface of Zr-doped ceria, and this distance is 2.18 Å. When it replaces the Ce atom, the Zr atom pulls the oxygen atoms in its neighborhood closer to itself and increases the OCe distance. Given that the enthalpy of formation of ZrO2 divided by the coordination number is larger than the same quantity for CeO2, it is not surprising that Zr pulls away oxygen atoms from Ce. However, it is unexpected to see that Pt, which is barely able to bind oxygen and form an oxide, manages the same feat as Zr. The distance between the Pt dopant and the oxygen is 2.12 Å, the largest oxygenPt distance in PtO2 is 2.003 Å, and the CeO distance in the undoped ceria is 2.33 Å. Pt manages to pull oxygen close to it and away from Ce in spite of their great disparity in the ability to bind oxygen when they form an oxide. A look at Table 3 reveals that Mo, Nb, Ta, Ru, Zr, and W all manage to pull oxygen atoms closer to them and away from Ce.
The lack of correlation between the strength of the dopantoxygen bond in the oxide of the dopant and the effect of the dopant on ΔEv is explained, in part, by the ability of the Ce ions to change easily their formal charge from +4 to +3. This gives ceria great flexibility in adjusting to the extra electrons provided by these dopants. We will examine this possibility in section 4, where we discuss the changes in the projected density of states caused by doping and by the formation of an oxygen vacancy.
So far, we have discussed the lack of correlation between the ΔEv for doped ceria and the properties of the dopants oxides. We search for such correlations because if they exist, they can be used without performing calculations. We have found however some correlations between ΔEv and some of the computed properties of the dopants. Figure 3a shows that there is an approximate linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the Bader valence of the dopant. The Bader valence is the number of electrons donated by the dopant (the number of electrons on the atom of the dopant in gas phase, minus the number of electrons on the dopant, calculated by the Bader method). The two LVDs (La and Y) were not included in the linear least-squares fit because they influence the vacancy formation through a different mechanism than the other dopants.
Figure 3
Figure 3. (a) Dependence of the oxygen-vacancy formation energy on the Bader valence (i.e., the number of electrons lost by the dopant). The oxide is CeO2(111); the dopants are La, Y, Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, and W; the oxygen vacancy is in the surface layer close to the dopant. La and Y are LVDs and are not included in the linear least-squares fit of the data (which are taken from Table 1). (b) A linear fit of the bond length between the dopant and the closest oxygen atom, versus the electron gain (which is the maximum formal charge of the dopant minus its Bader valence (the number of electrons donated to the oxide)).
Figure 3b shows an approximate linear relationship between the bond length that is between the dopant and the oxygen closest to it in doped ceria and a quantity that we call the electrons on the dopant. This is the maximum formal charge of the dopant minus the Bader valence. For example, the maximum formal charge of Nb is 5, and its Bader valence in ceria is 2.56 (see Table 1); therefore, the electrons on Nb value is (5  2.56 = 2.44). The linear fit includes the LVDs La and Y. The graph shows a grouping of the dopants according to their maximum formal charge.
Projected Density of States (PDOS)
PDOS of CeO2(111)
The PDOS for CeO2(111) and reduced CeO2(111) (with one oxygen vacancy in the top layer, per supercell) has been published before. (28, 29) We calculated it for the slab used here because we want to compare it with the PDOS of the doped surfaces and would like to have them for the same functional value of U and slab size. As has been repeatedly shown, the creation of an oxygen vacancy produces two states in the gap, corresponding to two reduced Ce atoms (Figure 4).
Figure 4
Figure 4. Projected density of states for (a) undoped ceria and (b) undoped ceria with an oxygen vacancy in the surface layer of the supercell. The density of states of different systems were shifted to align the bottom of the conduction bands (dashed line). In each graph, the Fermi level is taken as the zero of the energy scale (dotted line). WF is the calculated work function. EOv is the energy of vacancy formation.
PDOS of Ceria Doped with the Low Valence Dopants La and Y
Table 1 shows that La and Y behave rather differently from the other dopants. They lower the energy of vacancy formation more and are the only dopants that have a long-range effect (in ceria). The stability of La and Y oxides is comparable to that of CeO2 (see Table 3), and if one used the cation-oxygen biding energy as a determinant of the change in ΔEv, one would predict that La and Y would bind the oxygen atoms near them as strongly as Ce. This guess is supported by the fact that the LaO and YO distances in La2O3 and Y2O3 are comparable to the CeO distance in CeO2. Thus, replacing a Ce atom with La or Y should not cause a large change in the oxygen positions. These observations would suggest that doping with La or Y would not change the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation. This is not what the calculations of ΔEv find.
Since La and Y are trivalent, they create an electron deficit in the system when they substitute a tetravalent cerium atom. A careful examination of Figure 5 shows a slight asymmetry at the top of the valence band: the density of states of the spin-up electrons is slightly less than that of the spin-down. Doping with La or Y creates a hole at the top of the valence band. This is consistent with the fact that the work function increases, and the Fermi level is now at the top of the valence band (see Table 1). When an oxygen vacancy is made in La-doped ceria, one of the unpaired electrons created when the O atom is removed (to make a vacancy) fills the hole, and the other electron reduces a cerium atom. This is in contrast with the vacancy formation in the undoped ceria surface where two Ce atoms are reduced. The energy of the hole is lower than the energy of the state in the gap (created by reducing cerium), and this is part of the reason why the presence of the dopant lowers the activation energy.

The presence of the hole in La-doped CeO2(111) also explains why the LVDs have a long-range effect. Since we calculate the lowest energy state, one of the electrons formed when the oxygen atom is removed (to create a vacancy) will always find the hole and fill it, lowering the energy of vacancy formation, regardless of whether the vacancy is far from or close to the dopant. Note that this mechanism is similar to that proposed by the long-range model: these dopants function as electron accepting reservoirs.
PDOS of CeO2(111) Doped with Pt, Ru, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W
The PDOSs are essentially the same whether the dopant is in the top or the bottom layer of the slab. The discussion that follows is valid for both situations. We address here the following questions: are there features in the projected density of states that explains why Pt, Ru, Ta, Nb, Mo, and W do not have a long-range effect? Why do these dopants affect by roughly the same amount of the energy of vacancy formation next to them?
The PDOSs of CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Ta, and W are shown in Figure 6. We are interested in the orbitals created by the presence of the dopant whose energy is in the band gap. Doping with Pt creates six new orbitals having energy at the top of the valence band. These orbitals are localized on Pt (see Figure 7a,b) and are a mixture of mostly Pt atomic orbitals with some contribution from O and Ce orbitals. Doping with Ru creates four degenerate spinorbitals in the band gap, localized on the Ru dopant (see Figure 8a) and consisting of a combination of Ru orbitals with a small contribution from oxygen.
Figure 6
Figure 6. Projected density of states for doped CeO2(111) without an oxygen vacancy and the dopant in the third Ce layer. The dopants are (a) Pt, (b) Ru, (c) Ta, and (d) W. Other details are the same as those in Figure 4. The density of states when the dopant is in the top layer are the same as the ones shown here. The PDOS of Mo are similar to those of W, and those of Nb are similar to those of Ta.
Figure 7
Figure 7. Orbitals in the band gap of CeO2(111) doped with Pt in the top layer. Before making a vacancy, there are six orbitals in the gap, all localized on Pt; four of them are very similar to the one shown in (a), and two are like the one shown in (b). After making the vacancy near the Pt dopant, there are eight orbitals in the gap, which are shown in parts (c) through (f). Each of these orbitals is doubly degenerate. There is no reduced cerium after the vacancy is made.
Figure 8
Figure 8. Doping with Ru forms four degenerate orbitals in the gap; one of them is shown in (a). The others look very similar. When a vacancy is made near the dopant, the degeneracy is lifted and one forms two pairs of orbitals, each pair consisting of identical orbitals with different spins. One orbital of a pair shown in (b), and an orbital from the other pair is shown in (c).
Doping ceria with Ta or W results in a different behavior. Ta donates one electron to the oxide, and this reduces a Ce atom; the one state in the gap, in Figure 6, is that of reduced Ce. A Ta atom has five electrons available for making bonds, but after this donation, it is left with four. The same is true for Nb (PDOS not shown). W donates two electrons to the oxide, which reduce two cerium atoms to produce two states in the gap. Since the W atom has six electrons available for making bonds, this electron donation leaves it with only four. This is also true for Mo (PDOS not shown). The Ru, Zr, and Pt atoms have four electrons available for making bonds, and none is used to reduce a Ce atom. Therefore, all dopants (Zr, Ru, Pt, Ta, Nb, Mo, and W) have four electrons available for bonding, which is the same as the Ce atom they substitute when the oxide is doped. We speculate that this might be one of the reasons why they affect ΔEv by roughly the same amount in spite of the fact that the stability of their own oxides is vastly different.
PDOS of CeO2(111) Doped with Pt, Ru, Ta, or W in the Third Layer and Having an Oxygen Vacancy in the Top Layer
Figure 9 shows the PDOS of the system with a dopant in the third layer and an oxygen vacancy in the surface-oxygen layer (located as far as possible from the dopant). For all doped surfaces, the two unpaired electrons created when the oxygen atom is removed (to make a vacancy) reduce two Ce atoms. This results in the formation of two new states in the gap, located on the reduced cerium atoms. This behavior is very similar to that seen when a vacancy is formed on the undoped surface. In particular, the formation of the vacancy does not affect the orbitals in the gap associated with the dopant. This is likely to be the reason why there is no long-range effect. We contrast this with the effect of the LVDs (La or Y), which create a hole in the valence band giving the electrons created when the vacancy is made a way to lower their energy (by occupying the hole).

PDOS of CeO2(111) Doped with Pt, Ru, Ta, or W in the Top Layer, Having an Oxygen Vacancy Next to the Dopant
In Figure 10, we show the PDOS of CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Ta, or W having an oxygen vacancy near the dopant. We examine Pt first since its electronic structure is different. Before an oxygen vacancy is made, there are six spinorbitals whose energy is in the band gap: four look very similar to the one shown in Figure 7a, and two are similar to that shown in Figure 7b. The six electrons populating these orbitals are all located mostly on the Pt dopant with minor contributions from the oxygen atoms. Making a vacancy near the Pt dopants multiplies the number of spinorbitals in the band gap to eight. Four of them are shown in Figure 7cf. For each orbital shown in the figure there is another one looking very similarly and having opposite spin. All these orbitals are located on the Pt atoms. This means that the two unpaired electrons created when an oxygen atom is removed to make the oxygen vacancy reduce the Pt dopant. In the absence of the dopant, making an oxygen vacancy would have reduced two cerium atoms. Pt is the only dopant on our list that is reduced when a vacancy is formed next to it.
Figure 10
Figure 10. PDOS for the CeO2(111) surface doped with Pt, Ru, Ta, and W in the surface layer, having an oxygen vacancy in the top layer, near the dopant.
Before making an oxygen vacancy in the top layer of Ru-doped CeO2(111) (the dopant and the vacancy are in the top layer, next to each other), the system has four degenerate orbitals in the gap, whose shape is shown in Figure 8a. Making a vacancy lifts the degeneracy and creates two pairs of orbitals, which are shown in Figure 8b,c. In addition, the unpaired electrons created when the vacancy is made reduce two cerium atoms, creating two new states in the gap, which are localized on Ce.
Before the making of an oxygen vacancy, Ta donates an electron to reduce one Ce atom (creating a state in the gap localized on Ce), and W donates two electrons to reduce two Ce atoms. When a vacancy is formed in these systems, the unpaired electrons produced when the O atom is removed reduce two Ce atoms, creating two new states in the band gap that are localized on Ce.
The electronic structure of ceria doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, W, or Mo varies substantially with the dopant. There is, however, a common factor that might explain why all of them change ΔEv by roughly the same amount. Mo and W atoms have six electrons available for making bonds, but two of them are used to reduce two Ce atoms. Therefore, Mo and W have only four electrons available for bonding and we can think of them as being tetravalent (when used to dope ceria). Ta and Nb have five electrons available for making bonds, but they use one of them to reduce a cerium atom. Therefore, they too are tetravalent when used as dopants in ceria. Zr is tetravalent, and Ru and Pt are capable of making tetravalent oxides. Therefore, the common factor is that all these dopants are tetravalent, as is the Ce atom they substitute. Another common factor is that the oxides of all these dopants have shorter metaloxygen bonds than the CeO bond in ceria. This means that all of these dopants pull the oxygen atoms away from the Ce atoms and thus weaken their bond to the oxide.
Summary
We found that the low-valence dopants (LVDs) lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation near them or far from them. This is true when they dope a reducible (CeO2) or an irreducible (MgO) oxide. It is very difficult to make doped oxides with all the dopant in the surface layer. XRD measurements show that some of the dopant is in the interior of the catalyst grains. It is, therefore, important to know if the dopants trapped inside the grain can affect the catalytic properties of the surface. If they do not, they are wasted, and this is troublesome when the dopant is expensive.
The LVDs affect the energy of vacancy formation because they create a hole at the top of the valence band. When an oxygen atom is removed, one of the unpaired electrons left behind lowers its energy by filling the hole created by the dopant. This mechanism is independent of the distance between the dopant and the site where the vacancy is formed. The energy to make a vacancy near the dopant is lower than the energy to make a vacancy away from it; this indicates that there is a chemical (local) effect that has to do with the way the dopant binds to the neighboring oxygen atoms.
The hole made by an LVD is sometimes delocalized (e.g., La-doped CeO2) and sometimes localized (e.g., Na-doped MgO). This does not affect the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, but it will affect the kinetics. If the hole is localized and an oxygen atom is removed (possibly by reaction with a reductant) at a site that is far from the dopant, the electrons left behind cannot instantly fill the hole. They will reduce two cerium atoms, near the vacancy site, making two polarons. Subsequently, the polarons will migrate, and when they are sufficiently close to the localized hole, the electrons will tunnel from the polaron into the hole. A kinetic simulation of this system must take into account the rate of vacancy formation (which does not benefit from the presence of a remote, localized hole), the diffusion of the polaron until it is close to the hole, and the rate of charge transfer from the polaron to the hole. A thermodynamic simulation is simpler because it is concerned with the equilibrium state, and when this is reached, the hole is filled; the energy of vacancy formation (to be used in a thermodynamic calculation) is the one calculated here; one of the unpaired electrons has an infinite time to find the hole and fill it.
In all the cases we examined, an LVD can be recognized a priori from the valence of the dopant in its own oxide and the valence of the cation in the host oxide (e.g., for Li-doped MgO, the monovalent Li replaces the divalent Mg). This is true for reducible or irreducible host oxides. In irreducible oxides, high-valence dopants seem to always increase the energy of vacancy formation. This increase is small in very stable oxides (MgO and La2O3) and substantial in less-stable oxide (e.g., ZnO). One exception to these rules is Ga-doped MgO. One expects Ga to be a trivalent dopant that will slightly increase the energy to make a vacancy. We were surprised to find that the energy decreases. An examination of the Bader charge on Ga, before and after vacancy formation, shows that Ga is reduced when the vacancy is formed, a process that reduces the valence of the dopant and the energy to make the vacancy.
The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopantoxygen bonds that are much shorter than the CeO bonds in ceria. This similarity is puzzling considering that the oxides of these dopants have vastly different enthalpies of formation.
An examination of the projected density of states (PDOS) shows that W and Mo donate two electrons to ceria to reduce two Ce atoms, and Ta and Nb donate one electron to reduce one Ce atom. After this electron donation, these dopants have only four electrons available for making bonds, just like the Ce atom they replace. The other dopants (Ru, Zr, and Pt) do not donate electrons to reduce Ce, and therefore, they also have four electrons for making bonds. We speculate that this is one the reasons for the similarity of their effect on ΔEv. The other reason is that their bonds with oxygen, in their own oxides, is much shorter than the CeO bond in CeO2. When one of these dopants replaces a Ce atom, it pulls the oxygen atoms in the oxide surface toward it and away from cerium. By doing this, they weaken the bond of the oxygen to the surface.
