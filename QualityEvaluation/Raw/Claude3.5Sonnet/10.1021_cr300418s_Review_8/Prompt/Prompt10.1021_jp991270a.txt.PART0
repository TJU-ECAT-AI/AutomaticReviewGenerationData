Abstract
Ceriumzirconium mixed oxides (CexZr(1-x)O2), precalcined at 900 C in dry air, were supplied by Rhodia Terres Rares as monophasic solid solutions. Introduction of some zirconium atoms in the ceria lattice by isomorphous substitution clearly influences the final properties of these materials as long as the cubic structure of ceria is maintained. Modifications in oxygen storage capacity (OSC measurements), redox properties (CO TPR), and oxygen exchange processes (TPIE) were studied. Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 was shown to have the most promising properties with the largest OSC at 400 C and the highest reactivity in O2 exchange. All mixed oxides are able to exchange very large amounts of oxygen compared to ceria, implying the participation of bulk oxygen. Furthermore, on CexZr(1-x)O2 samples, oxygen is predominantly exchanged via a multiple heteroexchange mechanism involving surface dioxygen species as superoxides or peroxides.

Introduction
Three-way catalysts (TWC) simultaneously have to oxidize CO and hydrocarbons (HC) to CO2 and reduce NOx to N2. Both oxidation and reduction reactions may take place at the same time if a stoichiometric mixture is employed. For that reason the ratio of oxidants (O2, NOx) to reductants (H2, CO, HC) should be maintained close to unity. This domain, where both CO, HC, and NOx conversions are optimum, is called the operating window. To enlarge this operating window and improve the catalyst performances during oscillations around the stoichiometry, ceria is systematically added to TWC. According to its redox properties, with a fast Ce4+/Ce3+ balance, ceria can store O2 during an oxygen-rich phase 1 and feed the noble metal with oxygen when the O2 partial pressure decreases. This specific property of ceria is commonly studied by measuring the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of the modified materials.
Nowadays, ceria tends to be replaced by CexZr(1-x)O2 mixed oxides. These new oxides have both better thermal stability and larger OSC. 2-9 High thermal stability is an essential requirement for these materials employed as supports in automotive converters. In fact, TWC can meet temperatures up to 1000 C. Numerous studies have been devoted to the investigation of structural, 10-19 surface, 20-22 and redox properties3,4,6,23-25 of these materials.
In this paper, OSC and redox properties of CeO2, ZrO2, and CexZr(1-x)O2 materials prepared by Rhodia are investigated, focusing on the correlation with 16O/18O isotopic exchange measurements. 26-27
Experimental Section
Materials. Ceriumzirconium mixed oxides with CexZr(1-x)O2 formula, x ranging from 0 to 1, were prepared by Rhodia Terres Rares (La Rochelle, France). Mixed oxide solid solutions are obtained by isomorphous substitution of Ce4+ cations (ionic radius 0.97 Å) with Zr4+ cations (ionic radius 0.84 Å). This substitution involves a decrease of the cell volume and the creation of structural defects. These defects play a crucial role in determining the redox properties of these solids.
Six oxides, with x = 1, 0.68, 0.63, 0.50, 0.15, and 0, are under study. These materials were calcined in a muffle furnace at 900 C for 6 h in order to work on stabilized samples.
Characterization. Structural Studies. Surface areas were measured by N2 adsorption at 196 C (single-point method) using a Micromeritics Flowsorb II.
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were collected on a Siemens D500 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Crystalline phases were identified by comparison with the ICDD files. To calculate the integrated width (β), diffractograms were simulated using Profile (Socabim, France). The best fit was obtained when assuming a Gaussian profile for the diffraction peaks. Calculated β values are corrected from the instrumental width determined using a silicium reference (SRM640a from NBS). An average crystallite size (D) was then calculated from the DebyeScherrer relation using peaks (111), (200), and (220) for ceria and cerium-rich mixed oxides (cubic structure), peaks (101), (110), (002), (200), (112), (211), and (103) for samples with tetragonal structure, and peaks (111) and (111) for zirconia. Experimental lattice parameters were finally calculated using a simulation program called U-FIT. This cell parameter refinement program was designed by M. Evain (IMN Nantes, France, 1992).
Structural properties of CexZr(1-x)O2 samples are summarized in Table 1.

Surface Oxygen Reactivity. Carbon monoxide oxidation on ceriumzirconium mixed oxides was studied by the way of three different methods of characterization: temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), oxygen storage capacity (OSC) measurements, and study of C16O oxidation and exchange on 18O-exchanged oxides.
Temperature-Programmed Reduction. Experiments were carried out in a conventional apparatus already described in a previous study. 28 An amount of 0.25 g of oxide is first prereduced at room temperature. The TPR itself proceeds by injection of CO pulses every 3 min into the He flow (30 mL min-1). At the same time, the sample is heated from room temperature up to 600 C at a ramp rate of 1.6 C min-1. Unconverted CO and produced CO2 are analyzed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a Porapak Q column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
The reducibility of the oxide is approached by calculating the total CO consumption (in μmol CO g-1) or CO2 formation.
Oxygen Storage Capacity. OSC of CexZr(1-x)O2 samples were measured at 400 C using the same kind of equipment as for TPR experiments. The sample (0.02 g) is first brought to 400 C under flowing He (30 mL min-1) before pretreatment under O2. Injection of pulses of CO (0.267 mL) every 2 min up to a maximum reduction of the sample (10 pulses) is followed by five pulses of O2. The cumulative oxygen storage capacity (OSCC) is calculated from both CO and O2 uptake. This value characterizes the total amount of oxygen available in the oxide. After that, to simulate lean and rich working conditions of an engine, alternate pulses of CO or O2 are injected. That way, we probed the amount of O2 immediately available in these materials (OSC).
Oxygen storage capacities (OSCC and OSC) are expressed in μmol CO g-1 from the CO consumption or CO2 formation (after CO pulses) or in μmol O g-1 from the O2 consumption (O2 pulses).
C16O Oxidation and Exchange. Experiments were carried out in a recycled reactor coupled to a mass spectrometer (QMG 420 Balzers). Mobile oxygen atoms of the oxide are first exchanged by contacting the sample with 50 mbar (1 mbar = 100 Pa) of 18O2 at 400 C for 2 h before 1 h outgassing at the same temperature. Carbon monoxide (50 mbar) is introduced in the reactor kept at 400 C. Evolution of the isotopomer partial pressures of CO (C16O, C18O) and CO2 (C16O2, C18O2, C16O18O) is monitored as a function of time. 29
18O2 Isotopic Exchange. Experimental Procedure. Six oxides (CeO2, Ce0.68Zr0.32O2, Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, Ce0.15Zr0.85O2, and ZrO2) were studied in the isotopic exchange of oxygen in order to examine the oxygen surface mobility. Experiments were carried out in the same equipment as for C16O oxidation and exchange on 18O-preoxidized samples. A quantity of 2.5 m2 of sample is placed in a quartz reactor and submitted to an in situ pretreatment proceeding as follows: oxidation (16O2) at 450 C for 15 min; reduction (H2) at 450 C for 15 min; outgassing at 450 C for 30 min. Finally, the sample is cooled to room temperature before reaction. Keeping in mind that all samples were supplied after precalcination at 900 C for 6 h, which clearly allows the removal of nitrates and carbonates surface contaminants issuing from the preparation, 30 this optimized procedure is sufficient for cleaning the surface from atmospheric pollutants. The validity of this standard cleaning procedure was also ascertained during FT-IR studies.
Exchange starts with the introduction of 50 mbar of pure 18O2 into the reactor. The temperature is increased from 25 to 600 C at a ramp rate of 2 C min-1. Oxygen isotopomer partial pressures P32 (16O2), P34 (16O18O), and P36 (18O2) are sampled every 10 s.
Results Interpretation. From the variation in partial pressures, information on the rate of exchange (Re), the number of oxygen exchanged (Ne), and the type of exchange mechanism may be obtained.26
where Ng is the total number of oxygen atoms in the gas phase, is the atomic fraction of oxygen-18 in the gas phase at time t, and is the initial atomic fraction of oxygen-18 in the gas phase.
Mechanisms for exchange are described by the following equations: 31
In our case, simple and multiple heteroexchange mechanisms are differentiated at the beginning of the reaction by prior appearance in the gas phase of 18O16O or 16O2, respectively.
Results and Discussion
Oxygen Storage Capacity. OSCC and OSC are measured on ceriumzirconium mixed oxides calcined at 900 C. OSCC values, obtained at 400 C for all CexZr(1-x)O2 samples (except ZrO2), are reported in Table 2. Those results clearly show that the introduction of small amounts of zirconium in the CeO2 lattice greatly improves its capacity to store oxygen and enhance its reductibility.

aReduction with CO uptake (μmol CO/g).bOxidation with O2 uptake (μmol O/g).
During OSCC measurements, CO uptake on an oxidized sample slowly decreases as the number of injected pulses increases. This observation indicates the kinetics of reduction. Nevertheless, after 10 pulses of CO, the sample is saturated and can be considered as fully reduced. In contrast, the reduced catalyst is completely reoxidized by the first pulse of O2. This observation remains valid for all oxides. As a conclusion, the reduction of these oxides is much slower than their reoxidation.
Furthermore, on pure ceria, more CO is consumed compared to the amount of CO2 produced. This discrepancy is attributed to the formation of carbonates species by reaction of CO with surface dioxygen species. 32-34 In fact, those species were clearly identified by FT-IR (12001600 cm-1).
Figure 1 represents the variations of the OSC values vs cerium content. As already seen above, incorporation of zirconium into the CeO2 lattice greatly improves the OSC. The largest OSC is obtained for Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 with 219 μmol O g-1 (5.5 μmol O m-2).

To go further into the interpretation of the results, the number of surface oxygen atoms may be calculated from the structure and the molar composition of the oxide (see Table 3). In what follows we will assume that Zr atoms do not participate in the redox process, no zirconium segregation occurs at the surface, and only one oxygen atom out of four is involved in the Ce4+/Ce3+ reduction process. Furthermore, different orientations of the surface may be considered and we will base our comments assuming either a (100) or an average (100) + (110) + (111) surface. In recent papers, Hori et al. 35,36 simply considered a (100) surface.

The above formula was transposed to the tetragonal system with a,btetragonal = a,bcubique2.
In the case of CeO2, OSC is limited to 74 μmol O g-1 (3 μmol O m-2) and the number of surface oxygen atoms can be estimated to be 13.7 atoms nm-2 (cubic structure: a, b, c = 5.403 Å, (100) surface), corresponding to a theoretical OSC of 5.7 μmol O m-2. Therefore, the storage of oxygen on ceria at 400 C is restricted to the surface.
In the same way, for Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, the number of surface oxygen atoms is estimated to be 14.2 atoms nm-2 (cubic structure: a, b, c = 5.31 Å, (100) surface) with a theoretical OSC of 3.7 μmol O m-2 while OSC measurements gave 5.5 μmol O m-2. In that case, oxygen storage takes place not only at the surface but also in the bulk.
No change in the interpretations occurs when considering an average (100) + (110) + (111) surface instead of the (100) surface.
These results show that the introduction of small amounts of zirconium into the CeO2 lattice promotes oxygen mobility. This specific behavior of mixed oxides is attributed to the participation of bulk oxygen atoms in the storage process.
In fact, similar results are found in the literature. Trovarelli et al.7 studied oxygen storage (OSC) on CexZr(1-x)O2 solid solutions prepared by mechanical milling of the parent oxides (ceria and zirconia). The maximum O2 uptake was observed for solids with 0.6  x  0.8, with an OSCC at 377 C of approximately 185 μmol O2 g-1. The same trend was also observed by Cuif et al. 6,37 with an optimum OSC for Ce0.6Zr0.4O2.
Temperature-Programmed Reduction. This method of characterization is used to test the reducibility of CexZr(1-x)O2 solids. CO TPR measurements were carried out on oxides calcined at 900 C. The results are shown in Figure 2. Reduction of CeO2 by CO occurs from 200 C and at a constant rate (constant CO consumption) up to higher temperature. The same type of flat profile had first been reported by Padeste et al. as they studied CO TPR of ceria. 38 In our case, the absence of any features at elevated temperature, presented as indicative of crystalline defects, could be taken as additional proof for the high perfection of the fluorite type structure of our ceria sample. For CexZr(1-x)O2 with x = 0.15, 0.5, 0.63, and 0.68, one single peak is observed with maximum CO consumption around 570, 480, 470, and 450 C, respectively. The CO uptake is much more important than for pure CeO2.
Figure 2 CO consumption calculated from TPR of CexZr(1-x)O2: (·) CeO2; () Ce0.68Zr0.32O2; () Ce0.63Zr0.37O2; () Ce0.0.50Zr0.50O2; () Ce0.15Zr0.85O2, () ZrO2.
At 400 C, the cumulative CO uptake for CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 is in agreement with OSC measurement results. In the case of pure ceria, reduction is restricted to the surface. At 600 C, the cumulative CO consumption indicates that the reduction occurs both at the surface and in the bulk for all oxides. In fact, considering a (100) surface, the reduction reaches up to two and seven oxygen atoms layers for CeO2 and Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, respectively.
By substitution of Ce4+ by Zr4+, the reducibility of the solids is widely modified. Ceriumzirconium mixed oxides are much more reducible than CeO2. The same conclusions were also drawn from previous H2 TPR. In fact, H2 uptake on CexZr(1-x)O2 samples has been widely studied.4,7,39,40 All the results show that incorporation of zirconium in the CeO2 lattice greatly increases the H2 consumption and decreases the temperature of bulk reduction. For pure CeO2, two peaks are observed around 600 and 800 C corresponding to the reduction of the surface and the bulk, respectively. 41,42 In the case of mixed oxides, the second peak is shifted toward lower temperatures and the far larger H2 uptake indicates a deeper reduction.
C16O Oxidation and Exchange. C16O oxidation and exchange was investigated on 18O-preoxidized CeO2 and Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 in order to understand the reactivity of surface oxygen atoms. These reactions also give additional information on the oxygen availability. In fact, this method had already been successfully used for the study of surface oxygen exchange reactions on Rh/CeO2 catalysts. 43
Evolution of the partial pressures for both C16O and the various products is recorded as a function of time. Results are shown in Figure 3 for CeO2 and Ce0.63Zr0.37O2. For both samples, oxidation of C16O to C16O2 is the predominant reaction while the formation of C18O2 is rarely detected. Moreover, exchange of C16O to C18O may be observed at a very low level. On Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, the oxidation of C16O to C16O2 occurs much more quickly than on CeO2. Oxygen is then much more mobile in this mixed oxide than in ceria.
Figure 3 Evolution of the isotopomer partial pressures of CO (·, C16O; , C18O) and CO2 (, C16O2; , C16O18O) as a function of time during C16O oxidation and exchange on CeO2 (A) and on Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 (B). Samples are preexchanged by 18O2 at 400 C.
To go further in the interpretation, the oxidation reaction can be written as
with r the rate of transformation of C16O,
Assuming steady-state conditions, the rate of transformation of CO is then directly equal to the rate of formation of CO2:
with
proportional to PCO2. Furthermore, if we assume that all reacting CO gives CO2(g) and that all formed CO2 comes from CO(g), the only possible reactions are
Starting from these reactions and by combining the different reaction rates, we get
where
with PC16O, PC18O, PC16O18O being the C16O, C18O, and C16O18O partial pressures, respectively, and α being the fraction of 18O atoms on the catalyst surface. From the early evolution of the partial pressures, α was calculated for both CeO2 and Ce0.63Zr0.37O2. We obtained α = 0.05 and 0.19 for CeO2 and Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, respectively. Now, from the results above we also know that during this period only surface oxygen atoms are involved in CO oxidation. Then the number of surface 18O sites on Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 participating in CO oxidation is 4 times greater than on CeO2. This difference can be explained by the difference in the amplitude of the exchange during the 18O pretreatment. In fact, we saw earlier, from the OSC measurements, that mixed oxides were able to store 4 times more oxygen than pure ceria.
Both methods (CO oxidation on 18O-preoxidized samples and the OSC measurements) are in very good agreement. Then a simple measure of the OSC already gives a good indication on the storage properties of the material.
18O2 Isotopic Exchange. Ceriumzirconium mixed oxides and ceria exchange in a narrow range of temperatures (Figure 4A). The temperature at the maximum rate of exchange (Tmax) varies between 440 and 540 C. As zirconium content increases, Tmax is progressively moved to higher temperature and the maximum rate of exchange increases. This surprising observation could be explained by the increase in the amount of oxygen exchanged. In the case of pure ZrO2, 18O2 exchange only occurs at elevated temperature (Tmax = 570 C). As a conclusion, the introduction of zirconium into the CeO2 lattice favors the exchange.
Figure 4 Evolution of the rate of oxygen exchange Re (A) and number of oxygen atoms exchanged Ne (B) on CexZr(1-x)O2 solids as a function of temperature (·, CeO2; , Ce0.68Zr0.32O2; , Ce0.63Zr0.37O2; , Ce0.50Zr0.50O2; , Ce0.15Zr0.85O2; , ZrO2).
For all oxides the total number of oxygen atoms exchanged at 600 C (3045 atoms nm-2) is important and much larger than the calculated number of surface oxygens (1017 atoms nm-2) (Figure 4B). In fact, for CeO2 and Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 oxides, surface oxygen atoms are already totally exchanged by 400 C. More precisely, from Table 4 we can see that this process also involves bulk oxygen atoms, with up to three oxygen layers exchanged (Nl). Again, Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 is the most reactive sample toward O2, as already seen before from OSC measurements.

aMechanism of exchange: simple (S) and multiple (M).bTotal number of oxygen atoms exchanged up to 600 C.cNumber of oxygen layers exchanged up to 600 C considering a (100) surface.
To identify the kind of mechanism of exchange on these oxides, the variation of P32 and P34 versus temperature was plotted (Figure 5). On CeO2, a simultaneous evolution of the partial pressures in 16O2 (P32) and 18O16O (P34) is observed at the beginning of the exchange (Figure 5A). This observation implies that both simple and multiple mechanisms take place at the same time. In the case of ZrO2, 18O16O is the first to be observed in the gas phase, which indicates a simple heteroexchange. For all mixed oxides, both simple and multiple mechanisms are observed (Figure 5B). Nevertheless, multiple heteroexchange is much more predominant on CexZr(1-x)O2 at the very beginning of the exchange (between 380 and 440 C) than it is on pure ceria.

Additional investigations on CeO2 and Ce0.68Zr0.32O2 were made on reduced and oxidized samples in order to study the effect of pretreatment. These experiments were carried out with 50 mbar of 18O2. We reported the variation of the ratio P32/P34 versus temperature (Figure 6). When P32/P34 is less than 1, simple heteroexchange is predominant, while multiple heteroexchange is favored for P32/P34 greater than 1. For CeO2, multiple heteroexchange is more favored on prereduced than preoxidized samples (Figure 6A). In contrast, for Ce0.68Zr0.32O2, the multiple mechanism is more predominant after an oxidizing pretreatment (Figure 6B). Pretreatment effects could be related to the variation in surface oxygen species populations.
Figure 6 Evolution of the partial pressure ratio P32/P34 as a function of temperature during TPIE experiments on CeO2 (A) and Ce0.68Zr0.32O2 (B). Effect of the pretreatment is shown for reduction under H2 at 450 C for 15 min (full symbols) or oxidation under O2 at 450 C for 15 min (open symbols).
Multiple heteroexchange occurs with simultaneous participation of two oxygen atoms of the oxide. Surface dioxygen intermediates involved could be superoxides (O2-) or peroxides (O22-) as proposed by Yao et al.1 Li et al. 44,45 studied dioxygen adsorption on ceria using FT-IR spectroscopy. Superoxides are indicated by a band at 1126 cm-1 and were found to be very sensitive to the pretreatment. Peroxide species are observed only on prereduced samples and identified by a band at 883 cm-1.
In our case, dioxygen adsorption was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy on both ceria and CexZr(1-x)O2 mixed oxide. Results obtained after oxidation of the wafer are shown in Figure 7. One minute after admission of O2 at room temperature, one single band at 1126 cm-1, characteristic of superoxides, is observed.
Figure 7 IR spectra of adsorbed dioxygen on preoxidized CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 1 min after admission of 20 mbar O2 at 25 C (absorbance m-2).
In the case of mixed oxides, the intensity of this band is also affected by the pretreatment of the sample. In fact, after a reducing treatment, the integrated surface of the band at 1126 cm-1 is lowered. This observation exactly correlates with the beginning of exchange presented above. The predominance of the multiple heteroexchange after an oxidizing treatment is derived from the higher concentration in superoxides at the surface. Furthermore, the large predominance of multiple heteroexchange at the beginning of the exchange on mixed oxides compared to pure ceria could be related to the presence at the surface of larger concentrations of dioxygen species (superoxides and peroxides), as indicated by FT-IR spectroscopy.
For CeO2, such a correlation has not yet been possible. In fact, carbonates species were also detected with specific bands in the 13001400 cm-1 wavenumber range. 46 Thus, since dioxygen species may be trapped to form carbonates by reaction with residual carbon, a proper quantification of superoxide species is difficult. To succeed, an extremely clean surface is required.
Furthermore, more recently, dioxygen adsorption on CexZr(1-x)O2 prepared by a solgel process8 has been investigated by Rossignol et al. 47 A successful correlation between OSC and the amount of surface dioxygen species observed by FT-IR was possible.
Conclusions
A study of monophasic zirconiumcerium mixed oxides (CexZr(1-x)O2, 0 x  1) demonstrated their specific properties.
First of all, Ce4+/Zr4+ cation isomorphous substitution in the ceria lattice markedly improves the thermal stability of such prepared oxides. In fact, after calcination at 900 C, Ce-rich mixed oxides maintain a relatively high surface area (4050 m2 g-1) compared to pure ceria. This makes those new materials good supports for catalytic converters.
Furthermore, oxygen storage capacity, redox properties, and oxygen mobility are also positively modified. In fact, OSC measurements and TPR experiments showed for Ce-rich mixed oxides both better oxidizing and better reducing abilities with larger OSC and CO uptake, respectively. In the same way, oxygen isotopic exchange studies indicated that mixed oxides react more quickly and on a larger scale than pure ceria. An optimum was identified for Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 with an OSC at 400 C of 219 μmol O g-1.
Finally, when TPIE results (number of exchanged atoms, exchange mechanism, ...) were closely examined, the behavior of CexZr(1-x)O2 was attributed to the participation of bulk oxygen atoms (number of oxygen layers exchanged was 3) and dioxygen surface species (superoxides, peroxides).
