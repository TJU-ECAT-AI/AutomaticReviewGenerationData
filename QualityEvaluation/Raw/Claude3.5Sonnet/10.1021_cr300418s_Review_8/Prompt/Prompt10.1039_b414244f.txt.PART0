Nanostructured CeO2ZrO2 mixed oxides have attracted great interest in the past 10 years, in
particular as redox or oxygen storage promoters in the three-way catalysts. However, it has now
became clear that both the chemistry of the simple oxides and the complex metalCeO2-based
oxide interactions can play a critical role in developing novel and highly active materials for a
number of processes, ranging from catalysts for H2 production from fuels up to ceramic materials
and solid state conductors for fuel cells. Despite the apparent simplicity of these systems, extreme
variability of their chemical and textural properties has been observed. An attempt is made here to
rationalise the various factors and the inter-connections to the structure, the texture, and the
effects of the nanometre scale, which all contribute to the properties of these materials.
1. Introduction
CeO2- and ZrO2-containing materials have attracted much
interest in recent years due to their extensive use in very
different fields, ranging from catalysis16 to ceramics,7 fuel cell
technologies,811 gas sensors,1215 solid state electrolytes,16
chromatographic materials,1719 ceramic biomaterials,20 cos-
metics,21,22 etc., in addition to the classical application of CeO2
as a glass polishing agent.1 However, the most relevant use of
CeO2-based compounds is in automotive pollution control, as
promoters of the so-called three-way catalyst (TWC). Virtually
all vehicles are nowadays equipped with catalytic converters,
which invariably contain some CeO2-containing oxide as
catalyst promoter, mainly doped CeO2ZrO2 materials. This
wide use of these systems as catalyst components prompted a
renewed interest with regards to these materials in the form of
nanosized, high surface area powders. We therefore address
the issues related to the catalytic use of such materials, by
considering specifically the targets for the synthesis and
characterisation of these apparently very simple systems in
the form of nanosized particles. The possibility of producing
redox nanomaterials with tuneable redox capability to activate
simple
reactants
has
recently
been
discussed.23
Nano-
structuring the materials to provide novel properties appears
as a cutting edge frontier in designing catalysts and catalyst
promoters for specific catalytic reactions.
The present paper is focused on CexZr12xO2 solid solutions
and organised as follows: first, the structural and phase
homogeneity
are
analysed,
then
textural
properties
are
discussed. Some correlations between these parameters and
chemical behaviour are traced. Attempts are made to give a
rationale of aspects concerning the structural and chemical
properties at the core of the intriguing properties of this
system. It is important to notice that despite 50 years of
investigations,2436
there
are
still
disagreements
on
the
phase diagram itself and its phase boundaries,3,37 besides
problems related to structural aspects38 and chemical (redox)
behaviour.23

2. Structural properties of CeO2ZrO2 mixed oxides
2.1. Phase diagram and phase homogeneity
Due to the wide interest in ZrO2-containing materials,
particularly in the field of ceramics, structural properties and
the phase diagram of CeO2ZrO2 mixed oxides have attracted
interest for more than half a century.2434,36,3944 However,
despite the apparent simplicity of the system, both the phase
diagram and structural properties of the CeO2ZrO2 system
are still a matter of investigation. This is due to the fact that
given the relatively large misfit between the Zr(IV) and Ce(IV)
ionic radii (0.084 vs. 0.097 nm) and the different structures at
room temperature (RT) of the parent oxides (ZrO2: mono-
clinic, space group P21/c and CeO2: cubic-fluorite type, space
group Fm3
m),45 formation of a thermodynamically stable solid
solution is not favoured over the whole range of composi-
tions.46 Yashima et al.31,47,48 categorised the tetragonal phases
into t, t9 and t0 phases, according to the type of the tetragonal
distortion (ratio of cell parameters c/a 5 1.02, 1.0011.02 and
1 respectively) and its nature, i.e. t-phase which is stable, and
t9, t0 which are metastable. In addition to these phases, a cubic
phase is observed for CeO2 contents above 80 mol% and a
monoclinic below ca. 10 mol%. All the tetragonal phases were
indexed in the P42/nmc space group. Recently, two new phases,
designated k and t* have been reported and characterized for
the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 composition. These phases are generated by
controlled re-oxidation of pyrochlore Ce2Zr2O7+y and differ in
the cation ordering.4952 The possibility of these oxides
undergoing a relatively facile reduction makes exact definition
of the phase diagram challenging because reduced phases
should be taken into account, as they may be formed at high
temperatures even under oxidising conditions.25 Furthermore,
it has now become clearly evident that, due to the metastability
of these systems, the processing of the sample, i.e. temperature
and extent of reduction and oxidation that have been
applied to the mixed oxide precursor, plays a key role in
leading to systems possessing different structural and chemical
properties.40,51,5358
The metastability of the t9 and t0 phases, which exist in the
range of CeO2 content 2080 mol%, has represented a real
challenge for the characterisation of these materials, particu-
larly those employed in catalytic applications. Even if redox
properties, which are the most important ones in catalytic
applications,
may
concern
the
bulk
even
at
moderate
temperatures,59,60 a high surface area of the products is a
necessary requisite in this case, to maximise the gassolid
contact under catalytic conditions. This adds complexity to the
characterisation of these mixed oxides since: (i) the XRD
patterns are broadened due to low particle size of such high
surface area product, not allowing a proper assessment of the
presence of a single phase; and (ii) when the material is
calcined at high temperatures to induce its partial sintering and
hence sharpening of the XRD profiles, phase segregation may
be observed for compositions where the metastable phases are
formed (20 mol% , CeO2 , 80 mol%).61,62 In fact, the thermal
stability of the metastable phases in high surface area
samples depends on several factors (compare ref. 37 and

<questions>


How do same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, and what insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications? Additionally, what challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)?
