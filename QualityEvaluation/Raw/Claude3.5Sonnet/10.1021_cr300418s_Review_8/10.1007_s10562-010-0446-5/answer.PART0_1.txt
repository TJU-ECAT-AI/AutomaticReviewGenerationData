[1] "Significantly, its redox performance can be further enhanced by the presence of various dopants, such as Zr4+, Ca2+ and some noble metal [36]."

[2] "Zr-dopants further weaken the CeO bonds in the substrate and therefore facilitate direct formation of CO + OL  CO2,gas."

[3] "Zr dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and hence weaken the CeO bonds, which benefit the direct oxidation of CO on Zr-doped ceria."

[4] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."

The literature primarily focuses on Zr4+ as a same-valence dopant (SVD) in ceria, providing insights into its effects on catalytic properties:

1. Zr4+ dopants enhance the redox performance of ceria.

2. They weaken CeO bonds, facilitating CO oxidation by lattice oxygen.

3. Zr4+ promotes the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, which is beneficial for CO oxidation.

4. The smaller size of Zr4+ compared to Ce4+ releases stress, allowing easier formation of Ce3+.

5. Zr-doping leads to lower reduction energy and higher oxygen mobility in ceria.

The study does not provide comprehensive information on high-valence dopants (HVDs) or compare SVDs and HVDs across different metal oxides. It also doesn't address challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior or discuss Lewis acid-base interactions in detail.

The research demonstrates that computational studies can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which dopants affect catalytic performance. However, the focus on a single dopant (Zr4+) in ceria limits the ability to draw broader conclusions about dopant behavior across various metal oxides or to formulate general predictive rules.

这篇文献主要关注Zr4+作为同价掺杂剂(SVD)在氧化铈中的作用,提供了关于其对催化性能影响的见解:

1. Zr4+掺杂剂增强了氧化铈的氧化还原性能。

2. 它们削弱了CeO键,促进了晶格氧对CO的氧化。

3. Zr4+促进了Ce4+到Ce3+的还原,这有利于CO氧化。

4. 与Ce4+相比,Zr4+的尺寸较小,释放了应力,使Ce3+更容易形成。

5. Zr掺杂导致氧化铈的还原能降低,氧移动性增加。

这项研究没有提供关于高价掺杂剂(HVDs)的全面信息,也没有比较不同金属氧化物中SVDs和HVDs的作用。它也没有讨论制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战,或详细讨论路易斯酸碱相互作用。

这项研究表明,计算研究可以为掺杂剂影响催化性能的机制提供有价值的见解。然而,仅关注氧化铈中的单一掺杂剂(Zr4+)限制了对各种金属氧化物中掺杂剂行为得出更广泛结论或制定一般预测规则的能力。
