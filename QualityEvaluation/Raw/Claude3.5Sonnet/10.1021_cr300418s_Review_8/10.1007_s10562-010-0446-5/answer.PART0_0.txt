[1] "Significantly, its redox performance can be further enhanced by the presence of various dopants, such as Zr4+, Ca2+ and some noble metal [36]."

[2] "Zr dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3 and hence weaken the CeO bonds, which benefit the direct formation and release of CO2."

[3] "Zr is irreducible and thus may substantially change the local chemistry."

[4] "Apparently, Zr dopants strongly change the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation on the ceria (111) surface."

[5] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."

The literature provides insights mainly on Zr4+ as a same-valence dopant (SVD) in ceria, but does not extensively discuss high-valence dopants (HVDs) or other metal oxides. For Zr-doped ceria:

1. Zr4+ enhances the redox performance and catalytic activity of ceria, particularly for CO oxidation.

2. Zr facilitates the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, weakening Ce-O bonds and promoting oxygen mobility.

3. The smaller size of Zr4+ compared to Ce4+ releases stress, allowing easier formation of Ce3+.

4. Zr doping lowers the reduction energy and oxygen vacancy formation energy in ceria.

5. These effects lead to changes in the reaction mechanism for CO oxidation on ceria surfaces.

The paper does not provide sufficient information to formulate general predictive rules for dopant behavior across different metal oxides or to compare SVDs and HVDs comprehensively. It also does not discuss Lewis acid-base interactions or compare reducible vs. irreducible oxides in detail. More studies on various dopants and host oxides would be needed to address these aspects and develop broader predictive models for dopant effects on catalytic properties.

该文献主要提供了关于Zr4+作为同价掺杂剂(SVD)在氧化铈中的见解，但并未广泛讨论高价掺杂剂(HVDs)或其他金属氧化物。对于掺锆的氧化铈：

1. Zr4+增强了氧化铈的氧化还原性能和催化活性，特别是对CO氧化反应。

2. Zr促进了Ce4+还原为Ce3+的过程，削弱了Ce-O键并提高了氧的迁移性。

3. 相比Ce4+，Zr4+的较小尺寸释放了应力，使Ce3+更容易形成。

4. 锆掺杂降低了氧化铈的还原能和氧空位形成能。

5. 这些效应导致了氧化铈表面CO氧化反应机理的改变。

该论文没有提供足够的信息来制定适用于不同金属氧化物的掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则，也没有全面比较SVDs和HVDs。它也没有详细讨论路易斯酸碱相互作用，或比较可还原与不可还原的氧化物。需要对各种掺杂剂和宿主氧化物进行更多研究，以解决这些方面的问题，并开发出更广泛的掺杂剂效应对催化性能影响的预测模型。
