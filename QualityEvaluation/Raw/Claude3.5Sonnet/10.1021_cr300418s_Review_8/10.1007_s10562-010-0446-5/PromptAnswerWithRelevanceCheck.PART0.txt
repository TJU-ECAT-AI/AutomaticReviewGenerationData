[1] "Significantly, its redox performance can be further enhanced by the presence of various dopants, such as Zr4+, Ca2+ and some noble metal [36]."

[2] "Zr dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3 and hence weaken the CeO bonds, which benefit the direct formation and release of CO2."

[3] "Zr is irreducible and thus may substantially change the local chemistry."

[4] "Apparently, Zr dopants strongly change the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation on the ceria (111) surface."

[5] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."

The literature provides insights mainly on Zr4+ as a same-valence dopant (SVD) in ceria, but does not extensively discuss high-valence dopants (HVDs) or other metal oxides. For Zr-doped ceria:

1. Zr4+ enhances the redox performance and catalytic activity of ceria, particularly for CO oxidation.

2. Zr facilitates the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, weakening Ce-O bonds and promoting oxygen mobility.

3. The smaller size of Zr4+ compared to Ce4+ releases stress, allowing easier formation of Ce3+.

4. Zr doping lowers the reduction energy and oxygen vacancy formation energy in ceria.

5. These effects lead to changes in the reaction mechanism for CO oxidation on ceria surfaces.

The paper does not provide sufficient information to formulate general predictive rules for dopant behavior across different metal oxides or to compare SVDs and HVDs comprehensively. It also does not discuss Lewis acid-base interactions or compare reducible vs. irreducible oxides in detail. More studies on various dopants and host oxides would be needed to address these aspects and develop broader predictive models for dopant effects on catalytic properties.

该文献主要提供了关于Zr4+作为同价掺杂剂(SVD)在氧化铈中的见解，但并未广泛讨论高价掺杂剂(HVDs)或其他金属氧化物。对于掺锆的氧化铈：

1. Zr4+增强了氧化铈的氧化还原性能和催化活性，特别是对CO氧化反应。

2. Zr促进了Ce4+还原为Ce3+的过程，削弱了Ce-O键并提高了氧的迁移性。

3. 相比Ce4+，Zr4+的较小尺寸释放了应力，使Ce3+更容易形成。

4. 锆掺杂降低了氧化铈的还原能和氧空位形成能。

5. 这些效应导致了氧化铈表面CO氧化反应机理的改变。

该论文没有提供足够的信息来制定适用于不同金属氧化物的掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则，也没有全面比较SVDs和HVDs。它也没有详细讨论路易斯酸碱相互作用，或比较可还原与不可还原的氧化物。需要对各种掺杂剂和宿主氧化物进行更多研究，以解决这些方面的问题，并开发出更广泛的掺杂剂效应对催化性能影响的预测模型。

The literature primarily focuses on Zr4+ as a same-valence dopant (SVD) in ceria, providing insights into its effects on catalytic properties:

1. Zr4+ dopants enhance the redox performance of ceria.

2. They weaken CeO bonds, facilitating CO oxidation by lattice oxygen.

3. Zr4+ promotes the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, which is beneficial for CO oxidation.

4. The smaller size of Zr4+ compared to Ce4+ releases stress, allowing easier formation of Ce3+.

5. Zr-doping leads to lower reduction energy and higher oxygen mobility in ceria.

The study does not provide comprehensive information on high-valence dopants (HVDs) or compare SVDs and HVDs across different metal oxides. It also doesn't address challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior or discuss Lewis acid-base interactions in detail.

The research demonstrates that computational studies can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which dopants affect catalytic performance. However, the focus on a single dopant (Zr4+) in ceria limits the ability to draw broader conclusions about dopant behavior across various metal oxides or to formulate general predictive rules.

这篇文献主要关注Zr4+作为同价掺杂剂(SVD)在氧化铈中的作用,提供了关于其对催化性能影响的见解:

1. Zr4+掺杂剂增强了氧化铈的氧化还原性能。

2. 它们削弱了CeO键,促进了晶格氧对CO的氧化。

3. Zr4+促进了Ce4+到Ce3+的还原,这有利于CO氧化。

4. 与Ce4+相比,Zr4+的尺寸较小,释放了应力,使Ce3+更容易形成。

5. Zr掺杂导致氧化铈的还原能降低,氧移动性增加。

这项研究没有提供关于高价掺杂剂(HVDs)的全面信息,也没有比较不同金属氧化物中SVDs和HVDs的作用。它也没有讨论制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战,或详细讨论路易斯酸碱相互作用。

这项研究表明,计算研究可以为掺杂剂影响催化性能的机制提供有价值的见解。然而,仅关注氧化铈中的单一掺杂剂(Zr4+)限制了对各种金属氧化物中掺杂剂行为得出更广泛结论或制定一般预测规则的能力。

The literature primarily focuses on the effects of Zr4+ as a same-valence dopant (SVD) in ceria for CO oxidation catalysis. It provides some insights into how SVDs influence catalytic properties:

1. SVDs like Zr4+ can enhance the redox performance of metal oxides like ceria.

2. Zr dopants weaken Ce-O bonds, facilitating CO oxidation with lattice oxygen.

3. Zr changes the local chemistry and reaction mechanism on ceria surfaces.

4. Zr reduces the energy cost for oxygen vacancy formation and increases lattice oxygen mobility.

5. The smaller size of Zr4+ compared to Ce4+ releases stress, allowing easier formation of Ce3+.

However, the document does not provide comprehensive information on high-valence dopants (HVDs) or comparisons between SVDs and HVDs across different metal oxides. It also does not discuss challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior or factors like Lewis acid-base interactions.

The literature is focused on computational studies of Zr-doped ceria for CO oxidation, so it lacks broader insights on dopant effects in various catalytic applications or experimental validations. To fully answer the question, additional research on a wider range of dopants, metal oxides, and applications would be needed.

该文献主要关注Zr掺杂二氧化铈用于CO氧化的计算研究，因此缺乏对各种催化应用中掺杂剂效应的更广泛见解或实验验证。要全面回答这个问题，需要对更广泛的掺杂剂、金属氧化物和应用进行额外的研究。

2. Zr doping weakens CeO bonds, facilitating CO oxidation by making lattice oxygen more reactive.

3. Zr dopants promote the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, which further weakens CeO bonds and benefits CO oxidation.

4. Zr doping improves catalytic performance through multiple mechanisms:
   a) The smaller size of Zr4+ reduces stress for Ce3+ formation.
   b) It lowers the reduction energy.
   c) It increases oxygen mobility in the ceria lattice.

The study does not provide direct comparisons between SVDs and high-valence dopants (HVDs), nor does it extensively discuss other metal oxides or general predictive rules for dopant behavior. The focus is primarily on Zr-doped ceria for CO oxidation catalysis.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior are not explicitly addressed in this literature. The study emphasizes the importance of factors such as dopant size, reduction energy, and oxygen mobility, but does not discuss Lewis acid-base interactions or compare reducible vs. irreducible host oxides in detail.

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of dopant effects across various metal oxides and to develop general predictive rules, further studies comparing different dopants, host oxides, and catalytic reactions would be necessary.

The literature provides some insights into how same-valence dopants (SVDs) like Zr4+ influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly ceria (CeO2). Zr-doping enhances the redox performance and catalytic activity of ceria for CO oxidation in several ways:

1. It weakens Ce-O bonds, making lattice oxygen more reactive.
2. The smaller size of Zr4+ compared to Ce4+ releases stress, facilitating the formation of Ce3+.
3. It reduces the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation.
4. It increases oxygen mobility in the doped ceria.

These effects make Zr-doped ceria more efficient at oxidizing CO through the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involving lattice oxygen.

The paper does not provide information on high-valence dopants or compare SVDs to HVDs. It also doesn't discuss dopant effects in other metal oxides besides ceria or address challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior. The focus is specifically on Zr-doping in ceria for CO oxidation catalysis.

More research would be needed to develop broader insights across different dopants, host oxides, and catalytic applications. Factors like Lewis acid-base interactions and reducibility of the host oxide are not explicitly discussed in this context.

1. 它削弱了Ce-O键，使晶格氧更具反应性。
2. 与Ce4+相比，Zr4+的尺寸更小，释放了应力，有利于Ce3+的形成。
3. 它降低了氧空位形成所需的能量。
4. 它增加了掺杂氧化铈中氧的移动性。

这些效应使Zr掺杂的氧化铈通过涉及晶格氧的Mars-van Krevelen机制更有效地氧化CO。

该论文没有提供关于高价掺杂剂的信息，也没有比较SVDs和HVDs。它也没有讨论掺杂剂在氧化铈以外的其他金属氧化物中的效应，或解决制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战。重点特别是在CO氧化催化中氧化铈的Zr掺杂。

需要更多的研究来开发不同掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和催化应用之间的更广泛见解。在这种情况下，没有明确讨论诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的可还原性等因素。
