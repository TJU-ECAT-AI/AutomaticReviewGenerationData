[1] "Significantly, its redox performance can be further enhanced by the presence of various dopants, such as Zr4+, Ca2+ and some noble metal [36]."

[2] "Zr-dopants further weaken the CeO bonds in the substrate and therefore facilitate direct formation of CO + OL  CO2,gas."

[3] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."

The literature provides some insights into how same-valence dopants (SVDs) like Zr4+ influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly ceria (CeO2). Zr-doping enhances the redox performance and catalytic activity of ceria for CO oxidation in several ways:

1. It weakens Ce-O bonds, making lattice oxygen more reactive.
2. The smaller size of Zr4+ compared to Ce4+ releases stress, facilitating the formation of Ce3+.
3. It reduces the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation.
4. It increases oxygen mobility in the doped ceria.

These effects make Zr-doped ceria more efficient at oxidizing CO through the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involving lattice oxygen.

The paper does not provide information on high-valence dopants or compare SVDs to HVDs. It also doesn't discuss dopant effects in other metal oxides besides ceria or address challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior. The focus is specifically on Zr-doping in ceria for CO oxidation catalysis.

More research would be needed to develop broader insights across different dopants, host oxides, and catalytic applications. Factors like Lewis acid-base interactions and reducibility of the host oxide are not explicitly discussed in this context.

该文献提供了一些关于同价掺杂剂（SVDs）如Zr4+如何影响金属氧化物，特别是氧化铈（CeO2）的催化性能的见解。Zr掺杂通过以下几种方式增强了氧化铈在CO氧化中的氧化还原性能和催化活性：

1. 它削弱了Ce-O键，使晶格氧更具反应性。
2. 与Ce4+相比，Zr4+的尺寸更小，释放了应力，有利于Ce3+的形成。
3. 它降低了氧空位形成所需的能量。
4. 它增加了掺杂氧化铈中氧的移动性。

这些效应使Zr掺杂的氧化铈通过涉及晶格氧的Mars-van Krevelen机制更有效地氧化CO。

该论文没有提供关于高价掺杂剂的信息，也没有比较SVDs和HVDs。它也没有讨论掺杂剂在氧化铈以外的其他金属氧化物中的效应，或解决制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战。重点特别是在CO氧化催化中氧化铈的Zr掺杂。

需要更多的研究来开发不同掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和催化应用之间的更广泛见解。在这种情况下，没有明确讨论诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的可还原性等因素。
