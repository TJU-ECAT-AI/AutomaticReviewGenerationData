          [1] "Significantly, its redox performance can be further enhanced by the presence of various dopants, such as Zr4+, Ca2+ and some noble metal [36]."

[2] "Zr-dopants further weaken the CeO bonds in the substrate and therefore facilitate direct formation of CO + OL  CO2,gas."

[3] "Zr is irreducible and thus may substantially change the local chemistry."

[4] "Apparently, Zr dopants strongly change the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation on the ceria (111) surface."

[5] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."

[6] "Zr dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and hence weaken the CeO bonds, which benefit the direct oxidation of CO on Zr-doped ceria."

[7] "Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."

          The literature primarily focuses on Zr4+ as a same-valence dopant (SVD) in ceria, providing insights into its effects on catalytic properties for CO oxidation:

1. Zr4+ enhances the redox performance and catalytic activity of ceria.
2. Zr dopants weaken Ce-O bonds, facilitating CO oxidation with lattice oxygen.
3. Zr changes the local chemistry and reaction mechanism on ceria surfaces.
4. Zr reduces the energy cost for oxygen vacancy formation and increases lattice oxygen mobility.
5. The smaller size of Zr4+ compared to Ce4+ releases stress, allowing easier formation of Ce3+.
6. Zr doping lowers the reduction energy of ceria.

The study does not provide comprehensive information on high-valence dopants (HVDs) or comparisons between SVDs and HVDs across different metal oxides. It also does not discuss challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior or factors like Lewis acid-base interactions. The focus is primarily on computational studies of Zr-doped ceria for CO oxidation, lacking broader insights on dopant effects in various catalytic applications or experimental validations.

To fully address the question and develop general predictive rules, additional research on a wider range of dopants, metal oxides, and applications would be needed, including studies on reducible vs. irreducible host oxides and the role of Lewis acid-base interactions.

          该文献主要集中讨论了Zr4+作为同价掺杂剂(SVD)在氧化铈中对CO氧化催化的影响，提供了以下见解：

1. Zr4+增强了氧化铈的氧化还原性能和催化活性。
2. Zr掺杂削弱了Ce-O键，促进了CO与晶格氧的氧化反应。
3. Zr改变了氧化铈表面的局部化学性质和反应机理。
4. Zr降低了氧空位形成的能量成本，增加了晶格氧的移动性。
5. 与Ce4+相比，Zr4+的尺寸较小，释放了应力，使Ce3+更容易形成。
6. Zr掺杂降低了氧化铈的还原能。

该研究没有提供关于高价掺杂剂(HVDs)的全面信息，也没有比较不同金属氧化物中SVDs和HVDs的差异。它也没有讨论制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战，或诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用等因素。研究主要集中在Zr掺杂氧化铈用于CO氧化的计算研究，缺乏对各种催化应用中掺杂剂效应的更广泛见解或实验验证。

要全面回答这个问题并制定一般预测规则，需要对更广泛的掺杂剂、金属氧化物和应用进行额外的研究，包括对可还原与不可还原宿主氧化物的研究，以及路易斯酸碱相互作用的作用。
