[1] "Significantly, its redox performance can be further enhanced by the presence of various dopants, such as Zr4+, Ca2+ and some noble metal"

[2] "Zr-dopants further weaken the CeO bonds in the substrate and therefore facilitate direct formation of CO + OL → CO2,gas."

[3] "Zr is irreducible and thus may substantially change the local chemistry."

[4] "Apparently, Zr dopants strongly change the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation on the ceria (111) surface."

[5] "Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."

The literature primarily focuses on the effects of Zr4+ as a same-valence dopant (SVD) in ceria for CO oxidation catalysis. It provides some insights into how SVDs influence catalytic properties:

1. SVDs like Zr4+ can enhance the redox performance of metal oxides like ceria.

2. Zr dopants weaken Ce-O bonds, facilitating CO oxidation with lattice oxygen.

3. Zr changes the local chemistry and reaction mechanism on ceria surfaces.

4. Zr reduces the energy cost for oxygen vacancy formation and increases lattice oxygen mobility.

5. The smaller size of Zr4+ compared to Ce4+ releases stress, allowing easier formation of Ce3+.

However, the document does not provide comprehensive information on high-valence dopants (HVDs) or comparisons between SVDs and HVDs across different metal oxides. It also does not discuss challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior or factors like Lewis acid-base interactions.

The literature is focused on computational studies of Zr-doped ceria for CO oxidation, so it lacks broader insights on dopant effects in various catalytic applications or experimental validations. To fully answer the question, additional research on a wider range of dopants, metal oxides, and applications would be needed.

该文献主要集中讨论了Zr4+作为同价掺杂剂(SVD)在二氧化铈中对CO氧化催化的影响。它提供了一些关于SVD如何影响催化性能的见解：

1. 像Zr4+这样的SVD可以增强二氧化铈等金属氧化物的氧化还原性能。

2. Zr掺杂剂削弱了Ce-O键，促进了CO与晶格氧的氧化反应。

3. Zr改变了二氧化铈表面的局部化学性质和反应机理。

4. Zr降低了氧空位形成的能量成本，增加了晶格氧的移动性。

5. 与Ce4+相比，Zr4+的尺寸较小，释放了应力，使Ce3+更容易形成。

然而，该文档并未提供关于高价掺杂剂(HVDs)的全面信息，也没有比较不同金属氧化物中SVDs和HVDs的差异。它也没有讨论制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战，或诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用等因素。

该文献主要关注Zr掺杂二氧化铈用于CO氧化的计算研究，因此缺乏对各种催化应用中掺杂剂效应的更广泛见解或实验验证。要全面回答这个问题，需要对更广泛的掺杂剂、金属氧化物和应用进行额外的研究。
