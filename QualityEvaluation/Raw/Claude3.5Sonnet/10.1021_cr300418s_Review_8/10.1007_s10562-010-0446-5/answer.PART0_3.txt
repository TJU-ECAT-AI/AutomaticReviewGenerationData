[1] "Significantly, its redox performance can be further enhanced by the presence of various dopants, such as Zr4+, Ca2+ and some noble metal [36]."

[2] "Zr-dopants further weaken the CeO bonds in the substrate and therefore facilitate direct formation of CO + OL  CO2,gas."

[3] "Zr dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and hence weaken the CeO bonds, which benefit the direct oxidation of CO on Zr-doped ceria."

[4] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."

The literature primarily focuses on Zr4+ as a same-valence dopant (SVD) in ceria, providing insights into its effects on catalytic properties:

1. SVDs like Zr4+ enhance the redox performance of ceria.

2. Zr doping weakens CeO bonds, facilitating CO oxidation by making lattice oxygen more reactive.

3. Zr dopants promote the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, which further weakens CeO bonds and benefits CO oxidation.

4. Zr doping improves catalytic performance through multiple mechanisms:
   a) The smaller size of Zr4+ reduces stress for Ce3+ formation.
   b) It lowers the reduction energy.
   c) It increases oxygen mobility in the ceria lattice.

The study does not provide direct comparisons between SVDs and high-valence dopants (HVDs), nor does it extensively discuss other metal oxides or general predictive rules for dopant behavior. The focus is primarily on Zr-doped ceria for CO oxidation catalysis.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior are not explicitly addressed in this literature. The study emphasizes the importance of factors such as dopant size, reduction energy, and oxygen mobility, but does not discuss Lewis acid-base interactions or compare reducible vs. irreducible host oxides in detail.

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of dopant effects across various metal oxides and to develop general predictive rules, further studies comparing different dopants, host oxides, and catalytic reactions would be necessary.

该文献主要关注Zr4+作为同价掺杂剂(SVD)在氧化铈中的作用，提供了关于其对催化性能影响的见解：

1. 像Zr4+这样的SVD可以增强氧化铈的氧化还原性能。

2. Zr掺杂会削弱CeO键，通过使晶格氧更具反应性来促进CO氧化。

3. Zr掺杂促进Ce4+还原为Ce3+，进一步削弱CeO键，有利于CO氧化。

4. Zr掺杂通过多种机制改善催化性能：
   a) Zr4+的较小尺寸减少了Ce3+形成的应力。
   b) 降低了还原能。
   c) 增加了氧化铈晶格中的氧移动性。

该研究没有直接比较SVD和高价掺杂剂(HVD)，也没有广泛讨论其他金属氧化物或掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则。研究主要集中在用于CO氧化催化的Zr掺杂氧化铈。

这篇文献没有明确提到制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战。该研究强调了掺杂剂尺寸、还原能和氧移动性等因素的重要性，但没有详细讨论路易斯酸碱相互作用或比较可还原与不可还原的宿主氧化物。

要全面了解掺杂剂在各种金属氧化物中的影响并制定一般预测规则，需要进一步研究比较不同掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和催化反应。
