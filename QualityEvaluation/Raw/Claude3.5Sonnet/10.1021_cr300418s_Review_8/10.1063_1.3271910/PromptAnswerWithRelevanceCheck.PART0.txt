How do same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, and what insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications? Additionally, what challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the question about same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) and their influence on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. The document appears to focus specifically on La doping of ceria surfaces and CO adsorption, without discussing the broader topics of SVDs, HVDs, or their effects on various catalytic applications. There is no information provided about computational and experimental studies regarding dopant effects on catalytic performance in general, nor about challenges in formulating predictive rules for dopant behavior considering factors like Lewis acid-base interactions or the nature of the host oxide. The content of the given literature is too specific and limited to address the broad questions posed.

给出的文献中没有相关信息来回答关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)及其对不同金属氧化物催化性能影响的问题。该文档似乎主要集中在铈表面的镧掺杂和CO吸附上，没有讨论SVDs、HVDs或它们对各种催化应用的影响等更广泛的主题。文献中没有提供关于计算和实验研究对催化性能的掺杂效应的一般信息，也没有关于制定掺杂剂行为预测规则的挑战，包括考虑Lewis酸碱相互作用或宿主氧化物性质等因素。给出的文献内容过于具体和有限，无法回答所提出的广泛问题。

The given literature does not contain any information specifically addressing same-valence dopants (SVDs), high-valence dopants (HVDs), or their influence on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. The document appears to focus on La doping of ceria surfaces and CO adsorption, but does not provide details relevant to the broader question about SVDs and HVDs across various metal oxides. There is no information about computational and experimental studies comparing these dopant types, their effects on catalytic applications, or challenges in formulating predictive rules for dopant behavior. The text does not discuss Lewis acid-base interactions or compare reducible and irreducible host oxides in this context. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) and their influence on catalytic properties of metal oxides. The text appears to be focused on the effect of La doping on CO adsorption at ceria surfaces, which is not directly related to the question asked. There is no discussion of SVDs, HVDs, their effects on different metal oxides, computational or experimental studies regarding their catalytic applications, or challenges in formulating predictive rules for dopant behavior. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
