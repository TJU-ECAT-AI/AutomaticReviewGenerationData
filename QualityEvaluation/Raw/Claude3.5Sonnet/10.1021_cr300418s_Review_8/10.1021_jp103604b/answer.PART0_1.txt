[1] "We are concerned here with two catalytic mechanisms in which the oxygen atoms in the surface of the oxide catalyst play an essential role. One is the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen atom responsible for the oxidation of the reactant originates from the oxides surface. The other consists of the dissociative adsorption of a reactant in which the fragments bind to the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide."

[2] "By examining the results of prior calculations, (2, 4, 22, 28, 43, 48) we have formulated the following propensity rules: (1) To decrease the oxygen-vacancy formation energy, the valence of the dopant should be lower than or equal to that of the cation it is replacing (La in the present case). (2) The oxide of the dopant should be less stable (as judged by the enthalpy or the Gibbs free energy of formation) than the oxide being doped."

[3] "We have found that all of these dopants lower substantially the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, as suggested by the propensity rule mentioned above. We also found that there is an approximate linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant."

[4] "It is difficult to measure reliably the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the top layer of an oxide surface. Nevertheless, it appears that most DFT calculations find that the energy for forming oxygen vacancies is surprisingly high when compared with experiments. It is conceivable that this reflects errors in DFT, but we do not believe that the errors could be so large."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides primarily by affecting the oxygen vacancy formation energy. Computational studies have revealed that dopants with valence lower than or equal to the host cation tend to decrease the oxygen vacancy formation energy, which can enhance catalytic activity in certain mechanisms like Mars-van Krevelen oxidation.

The research shows an approximate linear relationship between the oxygen vacancy formation energy and the enthalpy of formation of the dopant's oxide. This provides a useful predictive tool for estimating dopant effects. However, challenges persist in formulating general rules due to the complexity of factors involved, such as the dopant's ability to change valence states, the structural differences between the dopant's oxide and the host oxide, and the distance between the dopant and oxygen atoms.

The study highlights that the most effective dopant (in this case, Cu for La2O3) may not always be the best choice for catalysis due to the "moderation principle." This principle suggests that if a dopant makes the oxide too strong of an oxidant, it may not be an effective catalyst because it will be easily reduced and difficult to reoxidize.

Challenges in predicting dopant behavior include the discrepancies between DFT calculations and experimental measurements of oxygen vacancy formation energies. The study suggests that these differences might be due to inadvertent doping in experimental samples, which can affect the Fermi level and local bonding of oxygen atoms.

The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) also plays a role in dopant effects, as seen in the different behaviors of vacancies in La2O3 compared to reducible oxides like TiO2 or CeO2. This demonstrates the need for considering the specific properties of the host oxide when predicting dopant effects.

Overall, while computational studies have provided valuable insights into dopant behavior, formulating general predictive rules remains challenging due to the complex interplay of various factors in metal oxide catalysis.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)主要通过影响氧空位形成能来改变金属氧化物的催化性能。计算研究表明，价态低于或等于主体阳离子的掺杂剂倾向于降低氧空位形成能，这可以在某些机制中（如Mars-van Krevelen氧化）增强催化活性。

研究显示，氧空位形成能与掺杂剂氧化物的生成焓之间存在近似线性关系。这为估计掺杂剂效果提供了有用的预测工具。然而，由于涉及因素的复杂性，如掺杂剂改变价态的能力、掺杂剂氧化物与主体氧化物之间的结构差异以及掺杂剂与氧原子之间的距离等，在制定通用规则方面仍然存在挑战。

研究强调，最有效的掺杂剂（在本例中为La2O3的Cu）可能并不总是最佳的催化选择，这是由于"适度原则"。该原则表明，如果掺杂剂使氧化物成为过强的氧化剂，它可能不是有效的催化剂，因为它会容易被还原且难以重新氧化。

预测掺杂剂行为的挑战包括DFT计算与实验测量氧空位形成能之间的差异。研究suggests表明，这些差异可能是由于实验样品中的无意掺杂，这可能影响费米能级和氧原子的局部键合。

主体氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）也在掺杂剂效应中起作用，这可以从La2O3中空位的行为与可还原氧化物（如TiO2或CeO2）的不同行为中看出。这表明在预测掺杂剂效应时需要考虑主体氧化物的特定性质。

总的来说，虽然计算研究为掺杂剂行为提供了宝贵的见解，但由于金属氧化物催化中各种因素的复杂相互作用，制定通用预测规则仍然具有挑战性。
