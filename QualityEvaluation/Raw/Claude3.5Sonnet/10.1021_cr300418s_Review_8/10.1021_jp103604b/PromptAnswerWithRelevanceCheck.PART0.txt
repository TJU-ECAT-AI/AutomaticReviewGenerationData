[1] "We have found that all of these dopants lower substantially the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, as suggested by the propensity rule mentioned above."

[2] "We also found that there is an approximate linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant."

[3] "If the oxidation reaction uses oxygen from the surface, the oxidation creates oxygen vacancies on the surface. However, because oxygen is present in the gas, the vacancies will be filled by a competing process."

The literature provides insights into how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, particularly focusing on lanthanum oxide (La2O3). The study found that both SVDs and HVDs can lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, which is a crucial factor in determining catalytic activity.

The research revealed an approximate linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant. This finding suggests that the stability of the dopant's oxide plays a significant role in determining its effect on the host oxide's catalytic properties.

However, the study also highlights the complexity of dopant behavior and the challenges in formulating general predictive rules. Factors such as the difference in valence between the dopant and the host cation, the nature of the dopant-oxygen bond, and the structural differences between the dopant's oxide and the host oxide all contribute to the overall effect of doping.

The literature emphasizes that the presence of oxygen vacancies does not necessarily lead to improved catalysis. The concentration of vacancies on the surface is determined by a competition between reduction and oxidation processes, which depend on various factors including temperature and gas composition.

An important insight from the study is the potential impact of inadvertent doping in experimental studies. The presence of small amounts of impurities in catalysts can significantly affect the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, potentially explaining discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results.

The study does not explicitly address Lewis acid-base interactions or make a clear distinction between reducible and irreducible oxides in terms of dopant behavior. However, it does suggest that the ability of a dopant to change its valence state (e.g., Cu vs. Mg) can influence its effect on the host oxide's properties.

In conclusion, while the study provides valuable insights into the effects of dopants on metal oxide catalysts, it also underscores the complexity of the topic and the need for further research to develop more comprehensive predictive models for dopant behavior in various catalytic applications.

这篇文献提供了关于同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)如何影响金属氧化物催化性能的见解，特别关注了氧化镧(La2O3)。研究发现，SVDs和HVDs都可以降低氧空位形成能，这是决定催化活性的一个关键因素。

研究揭示了氧空位形成能与掺杂剂氧化物形成焓之间存在近似线性关系。这一发现表明，掺杂剂氧化物的稳定性在决定其对宿主氧化物催化性能的影响中起着重要作用。

然而，研究也强调了掺杂剂行为的复杂性以及制定一般预测规则的挑战。掺杂剂与宿主阳离子之间的价态差异、掺杂剂-氧键的性质以及掺杂剂氧化物与宿主氧化物之间的结构差异等因素都对掺杂的整体效果有贡献。

文献强调，氧空位的存在并不一定导致催化性能的改善。表面上空位的浓度是由还原和氧化过程之间的竞争决定的，这取决于温度和气体组成等各种因素。

研究的一个重要见解是实验研究中无意掺杂的潜在影响。催化剂中存在少量杂质可能会显著影响氧空位形成能，这可能解释了理论预测和实验结果之间的差异。

该研究没有明确讨论Lewis酸碱相互作用，也没有在掺杂剂行为方面明确区分可还原和不可还原的氧化物。然而，它确实表明掺杂剂改变其价态的能力（例如，Cu与Mg相比）可以影响其对宿主氧化物性质的效果。

总之，虽然这项研究为掺杂剂对金属氧化物催化剂的影响提供了宝贵的见解，但它也强调了这个主题的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以开发更全面的掺杂剂行为预测模型，以应用于各种催化应用中。

[1] "We are concerned here with two catalytic mechanisms in which the oxygen atoms in the surface of the oxide catalyst play an essential role. One is the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen atom responsible for the oxidation of the reactant originates from the oxides surface. The other consists of the dissociative adsorption of a reactant in which the fragments bind to the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide."

[2] "By examining the results of prior calculations, (2, 4, 22, 28, 43, 48) we have formulated the following propensity rules: (1) To decrease the oxygen-vacancy formation energy, the valence of the dopant should be lower than or equal to that of the cation it is replacing (La in the present case). (2) The oxide of the dopant should be less stable (as judged by the enthalpy or the Gibbs free energy of formation) than the oxide being doped."

[3] "We have found that all of these dopants lower substantially the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, as suggested by the propensity rule mentioned above. We also found that there is an approximate linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant."

[4] "It is difficult to measure reliably the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the top layer of an oxide surface. Nevertheless, it appears that most DFT calculations find that the energy for forming oxygen vacancies is surprisingly high when compared with experiments. It is conceivable that this reflects errors in DFT, but we do not believe that the errors could be so large."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides primarily by affecting the oxygen vacancy formation energy. Computational studies have revealed that dopants with valence lower than or equal to the host cation tend to decrease the oxygen vacancy formation energy, which can enhance catalytic activity in certain mechanisms like Mars-van Krevelen oxidation.

The research shows an approximate linear relationship between the oxygen vacancy formation energy and the enthalpy of formation of the dopant's oxide. This provides a useful predictive tool for estimating dopant effects. However, challenges persist in formulating general rules due to the complexity of factors involved, such as the dopant's ability to change valence states, the structural differences between the dopant's oxide and the host oxide, and the distance between the dopant and oxygen atoms.

The study highlights that the most effective dopant (in this case, Cu for La2O3) may not always be the best choice for catalysis due to the "moderation principle." This principle suggests that if a dopant makes the oxide too strong of an oxidant, it may not be an effective catalyst because it will be easily reduced and difficult to reoxidize.

Challenges in predicting dopant behavior include the discrepancies between DFT calculations and experimental measurements of oxygen vacancy formation energies. The study suggests that these differences might be due to inadvertent doping in experimental samples, which can affect the Fermi level and local bonding of oxygen atoms.

The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) also plays a role in dopant effects, as seen in the different behaviors of vacancies in La2O3 compared to reducible oxides like TiO2 or CeO2. This demonstrates the need for considering the specific properties of the host oxide when predicting dopant effects.

Overall, while computational studies have provided valuable insights into dopant behavior, formulating general predictive rules remains challenging due to the complex interplay of various factors in metal oxide catalysis.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)主要通过影响氧空位形成能来改变金属氧化物的催化性能。计算研究表明，价态低于或等于主体阳离子的掺杂剂倾向于降低氧空位形成能，这可以在某些机制中（如Mars-van Krevelen氧化）增强催化活性。

研究显示，氧空位形成能与掺杂剂氧化物的生成焓之间存在近似线性关系。这为估计掺杂剂效果提供了有用的预测工具。然而，由于涉及因素的复杂性，如掺杂剂改变价态的能力、掺杂剂氧化物与主体氧化物之间的结构差异以及掺杂剂与氧原子之间的距离等，在制定通用规则方面仍然存在挑战。

研究强调，最有效的掺杂剂（在本例中为La2O3的Cu）可能并不总是最佳的催化选择，这是由于"适度原则"。该原则表明，如果掺杂剂使氧化物成为过强的氧化剂，它可能不是有效的催化剂，因为它会容易被还原且难以重新氧化。

预测掺杂剂行为的挑战包括DFT计算与实验测量氧空位形成能之间的差异。研究suggests表明，这些差异可能是由于实验样品中的无意掺杂，这可能影响费米能级和氧原子的局部键合。

主体氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）也在掺杂剂效应中起作用，这可以从La2O3中空位的行为与可还原氧化物（如TiO2或CeO2）的不同行为中看出。这表明在预测掺杂剂效应时需要考虑主体氧化物的特定性质。

总的来说，虽然计算研究为掺杂剂行为提供了宝贵的见解，但由于金属氧化物催化中各种因素的复杂相互作用，制定通用预测规则仍然具有挑战性。

The literature does not directly address the specific effects of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on different metal oxides. However, it does provide some insights into how dopants in general influence catalytic properties:

1. Dopants can substantially lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in metal oxides, which is an important factor in catalytic activity.

2. There appears to be a linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the dopant's oxide. This suggests that the choice of dopant can be used to tune the catalytic properties of the host oxide.

3. The effect of oxygen vacancies on catalysis is complex and context-dependent. While vacancies are often thought to be important for catalysis, this is not always the case.

4. Unintentional doping can significantly affect experimental results, making it challenging to formulate general predictive rules for dopant behavior.

5. Dopants can affect oxygen vacancy formation through two mechanisms: a global effect by changing the Fermi level, and a local effect by modifying chemical bonds near the dopant.

The literature does not specifically address challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, Lewis acid-base interactions, or the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) in relation to dopant effects. More research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

1. 掺杂剂可以显著降低金属氧化物中氧空位形成的能量，这是影响催化活性的一个重要因素。

2. 氧空位形成能与掺杂剂氧化物的生成焓之间似乎存在线性关系。这表明可以通过选择掺杂剂来调节宿主氧化物的催化性能。

3. 氧空位对催化作用的影响是复杂的，且依赖于具体情况。虽然空位常被认为对催化很重要，但并非总是如此。

4. 无意的掺杂可能会显著影响实验结果，这使得制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则变得具有挑战性。

5. 掺杂剂可以通过两种机制影响氧空位的形成：通过改变费米能级产生全局效应，以及通过修改掺杂剂附近的化学键产生局部效应。

该文献并未特别提及制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战、路易斯酸碱相互作用，或宿主氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）与掺杂剂效应的关系。要全面解答这些问题的方面，还需要更多的研究。

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides primarily by affecting the energy of oxygen vacancy formation. Both computational and experimental studies have shown that dopants can substantially lower this energy, which is crucial for catalytic activity in many applications.

The research suggests an approximate linear relationship between the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the dopant's oxide. This provides some predictive power but is not a universal rule due to other factors at play.

In catalytic applications, the concentration of oxygen vacancies is determined by a competition between reduction and oxidation processes. The steady-state vacancy concentration can be manipulated by introducing controlled amounts of strong reductants like CO, which can increase surface vacancies and potentially improve catalytic performance.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to multiple factors:

1. The difference in valence between the dopant and the host cation affects bonding.
2. The distance between the dopant and oxygen atoms in the doped oxide vs. the dopant's own oxide influences bond strength.
3. Structural differences between the host oxide and the dopant's oxide affect oxygen binding.
4. Lewis acid-base interactions play a role but are not explicitly discussed in the given text.
5. The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) is important, but the text doesn't provide specific insights on this aspect.

Additionally, the research suggests that inadvertent doping in experimental catalysts may explain discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results for oxygen vacancy formation energies. This unintended doping can affect catalytic properties through both global (Fermi level changes) and local (chemical bond modification) effects.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)主要通过影响氧空位形成能来影响金属氧化物的催化性能。计算和实验研究都表明,掺杂剂可以显著降低这种能量,这对许多应用中的催化活性至关重要。

研究表明,氧空位形成能与掺杂剂氧化物的生成焓之间存在近似线性关系。这提供了一定的预测能力,但由于其他因素的影响,并不是一个普适规则。

在催化应用中,氧空位的浓度由还原和氧化过程的竞争决定。通过引入受控量的强还原剂(如CO),可以操纵稳态下的空位浓度,这可以增加表面空位并可能提高催化性能。

制定掺杂剂行为的通用预测规则仍面临挑战,原因如下:

1. 掺杂剂与宿主阳离子之间的价态差异影响成键。
2. 掺杂氧化物中掺杂剂与氧原子之间的距离与掺杂剂自身氧化物中的距离不同,影响键强度。
3. 宿主氧化物与掺杂剂氧化物之间的结构差异影响氧结合。
4. 路易斯酸碱相互作用起作用,但在给定文本中没有明确讨论。
5. 宿主氧化物的性质(可还原vs.不可还原)很重要,但文本没有提供这方面的具体见解。

此外,研究表明,实验催化剂中的无意掺杂可能解释了氧空位形成能理论预测与实验结果之间的差异。这种无意的掺杂可以通过全局(费米能级变化)和局部(化学键修饰)效应影响催化性能。

[2] "We also found that there is an approximate linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant."

[3] "If the bonds in the system are purely ionic, the dopant with a lower valence will have a lower formal charge and this will affect its ability to bind the oxygen. If the dopantoxygen bond is purely covalent, the lower valence makes the dopant unable to bind all the oxygen atoms that La can bind, and this too will lead to a weakening of the bond of at least one oxygen atom to the surface."

[4] "It is unlikely that the effect of all of these factors can be captured by a linear relationship between the energy of vacancy formation in the doped oxide and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant. Further calculations are needed to determine how general this linear relationship is."

The study primarily focuses on the effects of lower-valence dopants (LVDs) rather than same-valence dopants (SVDs) or high-valence dopants (HVDs) on La2O3. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Both LVDs and SVDs (Cu, Zn, Mg, Fe, Al) were found to lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in La2O3, which can potentially enhance catalytic activity.

2. A linear relationship was observed between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the dopant's oxide, suggesting a possible predictive tool for dopant selection.

3. The study highlights the complexity of dopant effects, considering factors such as ionic/covalent bonding nature, dopant-oxygen distances, and structural mismatches between the dopant's oxide and the host oxide.

4. The research emphasizes the need for further calculations to determine the generality of the observed linear relationship and to develop more comprehensive predictive rules for dopant behavior.

5. The study does not directly address Lewis acid-base interactions or compare reducible vs. irreducible oxides, indicating that these remain areas for further investigation in understanding dopant effects on catalytic properties.

Overall, while the study provides valuable insights into dopant effects on La2O3, it also highlights the ongoing challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior across different metal oxides and catalytic applications.

2. 观察到氧空位形成能与掺杂剂氧化物的生成焓之间存在线性关系，这为掺杂剂选择提供了一个可能的预测工具。

3. 研究强调了掺杂剂效应的复杂性，考虑了离子/共价键合性质、掺杂剂-氧距离以及掺杂剂氧化物与宿主氧化物之间的结构不匹配等因素。

4. 研究强调需要进行进一步计算，以确定观察到的线性关系的普遍性，并制定更全面的掺杂剂行为预测规则。

5. 该研究没有直接涉及路易斯酸碱相互作用，也没有比较可还原与不可还原的氧化物，这表明在理解掺杂剂对催化性能的影响方面，这些仍然是需要进一步研究的领域。

总的来说，虽然该研究为La2O3的掺杂剂效应提供了宝贵的见解，但也突出了在不同金属氧化物和催化应用中制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的持续挑战。
