[1] "We have found that all of these dopants lower substantially the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, as suggested by the propensity rule mentioned above."

[2] "We also found that there is an approximate linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant."

[3] "It is often suggested that, because oxygen vacancies are chemically active, they must play an important role in catalysis. This is not necessarily the case."

[4] "We proposed a possible explanation. We note that it is possible that many of the catalysts studied experimentally may be inadvertently doped."

[5] "These unknown dopants can affect the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in two ways. A global effect occurs because the dopants change the Fermi level. This can, in turn, change the charge of the vacancy and the energy of its formation, which will affect the catalytic properties of the oxide."

The literature does not directly address the specific effects of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on different metal oxides. However, it does provide some insights into how dopants in general influence catalytic properties:

1. Dopants can substantially lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in metal oxides, which is an important factor in catalytic activity.

2. There appears to be a linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the dopant's oxide. This suggests that the choice of dopant can be used to tune the catalytic properties of the host oxide.

3. The effect of oxygen vacancies on catalysis is complex and context-dependent. While vacancies are often thought to be important for catalysis, this is not always the case.

4. Unintentional doping can significantly affect experimental results, making it challenging to formulate general predictive rules for dopant behavior.

5. Dopants can affect oxygen vacancy formation through two mechanisms: a global effect by changing the Fermi level, and a local effect by modifying chemical bonds near the dopant.

The literature does not specifically address challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, Lewis acid-base interactions, or the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) in relation to dopant effects. More research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

该文献并未直接讨论同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对不同金属氧化物的具体影响。但它确实提供了一些关于掺杂剂如何影响催化性能的见解：

1. 掺杂剂可以显著降低金属氧化物中氧空位形成的能量，这是影响催化活性的一个重要因素。

2. 氧空位形成能与掺杂剂氧化物的生成焓之间似乎存在线性关系。这表明可以通过选择掺杂剂来调节宿主氧化物的催化性能。

3. 氧空位对催化作用的影响是复杂的，且依赖于具体情况。虽然空位常被认为对催化很重要，但并非总是如此。

4. 无意的掺杂可能会显著影响实验结果，这使得制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则变得具有挑战性。

5. 掺杂剂可以通过两种机制影响氧空位的形成：通过改变费米能级产生全局效应，以及通过修改掺杂剂附近的化学键产生局部效应。

该文献并未特别提及制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战、路易斯酸碱相互作用，或宿主氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）与掺杂剂效应的关系。要全面解答这些问题的方面，还需要更多的研究。
