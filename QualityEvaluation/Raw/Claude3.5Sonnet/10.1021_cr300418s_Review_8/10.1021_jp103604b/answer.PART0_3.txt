[1] "We have found that all of these dopants lower substantially the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, as suggested by the propensity rule mentioned above."

[2] "We also found that there is an approximate linear relationship between the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the oxide of the dopant."

[3] "If the oxidation reaction uses oxygen from the surface, the oxidation creates oxygen vacancies on the surface. However, because oxygen is present in the gas, the vacancies will be filled by a competing process."

[4] "It is interesting to note that the concentration of vacancies at steady state can be manipulated by introducing in the feed controlled amounts of a strong reductant (e.g., CO), which will increase the number of vacancies on the surface."

[5] "We proposed a possible explanation. We note that it is possible that many of the catalysts studied experimentally may be inadvertently doped."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides primarily by affecting the energy of oxygen vacancy formation. Both computational and experimental studies have shown that dopants can substantially lower this energy, which is crucial for catalytic activity in many applications.

The research suggests an approximate linear relationship between the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and the enthalpy of formation of the dopant's oxide. This provides some predictive power but is not a universal rule due to other factors at play.

In catalytic applications, the concentration of oxygen vacancies is determined by a competition between reduction and oxidation processes. The steady-state vacancy concentration can be manipulated by introducing controlled amounts of strong reductants like CO, which can increase surface vacancies and potentially improve catalytic performance.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to multiple factors:

1. The difference in valence between the dopant and the host cation affects bonding.
2. The distance between the dopant and oxygen atoms in the doped oxide vs. the dopant's own oxide influences bond strength.
3. Structural differences between the host oxide and the dopant's oxide affect oxygen binding.
4. Lewis acid-base interactions play a role but are not explicitly discussed in the given text.
5. The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) is important, but the text doesn't provide specific insights on this aspect.

Additionally, the research suggests that inadvertent doping in experimental catalysts may explain discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results for oxygen vacancy formation energies. This unintended doping can affect catalytic properties through both global (Fermi level changes) and local (chemical bond modification) effects.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)主要通过影响氧空位形成能来影响金属氧化物的催化性能。计算和实验研究都表明,掺杂剂可以显著降低这种能量,这对许多应用中的催化活性至关重要。

研究表明,氧空位形成能与掺杂剂氧化物的生成焓之间存在近似线性关系。这提供了一定的预测能力,但由于其他因素的影响,并不是一个普适规则。

在催化应用中,氧空位的浓度由还原和氧化过程的竞争决定。通过引入受控量的强还原剂(如CO),可以操纵稳态下的空位浓度,这可以增加表面空位并可能提高催化性能。

制定掺杂剂行为的通用预测规则仍面临挑战,原因如下:

1. 掺杂剂与宿主阳离子之间的价态差异影响成键。
2. 掺杂氧化物中掺杂剂与氧原子之间的距离与掺杂剂自身氧化物中的距离不同,影响键强度。
3. 宿主氧化物与掺杂剂氧化物之间的结构差异影响氧结合。
4. 路易斯酸碱相互作用起作用,但在给定文本中没有明确讨论。
5. 宿主氧化物的性质(可还原vs.不可还原)很重要,但文本没有提供这方面的具体见解。

此外,研究表明,实验催化剂中的无意掺杂可能解释了氧空位形成能理论预测与实验结果之间的差异。这种无意的掺杂可以通过全局(费米能级变化)和局部(化学键修饰)效应影响催化性能。
