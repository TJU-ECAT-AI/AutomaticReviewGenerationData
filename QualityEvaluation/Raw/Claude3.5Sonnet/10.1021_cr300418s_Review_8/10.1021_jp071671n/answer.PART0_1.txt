[1] "Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase OVFE."

[2] "All these dopants can form oxides in which their oxidation state is greater than 2."

[3] "We were unsuccessful in our attempts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with other properties of the dopants like: the ionization energy, the electronegativity, the chemical hardness, and the covalent or the ionic radius."

[4] "At present, density functional simulations have to be performed for each particular dopant-oxide pair to obtain the trends in OVFE in a reliable manner."

[5] "We found that alkali dopants, as well as Ag and Au, are particularly active in weakening the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide with Pt, Pd, Cd, Ir, and Rh being less active."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) have different effects on the catalytic properties of metal oxides:

SVDs like Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba generally increase the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) in ZnO, making it harder to create oxygen vacancies and potentially reducing catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

HVDs from groups 3-7 of the periodic table (e.g., Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Zr, Nb, Mo) also increase OVFE significantly. This is likely due to their ability to form stable oxides with higher oxidation states than the host oxide.

However, some dopants like alkali metals, Ag, and Au decrease OVFE, potentially enhancing catalytic activity by making surface oxygen more reactive.

Computational studies have provided insights into these trends, but forming general predictive rules remains challenging. Factors such as dopant size, oxide structure mismatch, and bond strength all play roles, but no single property correlates well with OVFE across all dopants.

The main challenges in formulating predictive rules include:

1. Complex interplay of multiple factors affecting dopant behavior
2. Lack of clear correlation between OVFE and common dopant properties
3. Differences in behavior between reducible and irreducible oxides
4. Limited experimental data to validate computational predictions

Current research suggests that density functional theory simulations are necessary for each specific dopant-oxide pair to reliably predict trends in catalytic behavior. This highlights the need for continued computational and experimental studies to develop a more comprehensive understanding of doped metal oxide catalysts.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对金属氧化物的催化性能有不同的影响:

同价掺杂剂如Mg、Ca、Sr和Ba通常会增加ZnO的氧空位形成能(OVFE),使得氧空位更难形成,可能会降低氧化反应的催化活性。

周期表第3-7族的高价掺杂剂(如Ti、V、Cr、Mn、Zr、Nb、Mo)也显著增加OVFE。这可能是因为它们能够形成比宿主氧化物具有更高氧化态的稳定氧化物。

然而,一些掺杂剂如碱金属、Ag和Au会降低OVFE,可能通过使表面氧更具反应性来增强催化活性。

计算研究为这些趋势提供了洞见,但形成普遍的预测规则仍然具有挑战性。掺杂剂大小、氧化物结构不匹配和键强度等因素都起作用,但没有单一属性在所有掺杂剂中与OVFE有良好的相关性。

制定预测规则的主要挑战包括:

1. 影响掺杂剂行为的多个因素之间的复杂相互作用
2. OVFE与常见掺杂剂性质之间缺乏明确的相关性
3. 可还原和不可还原氧化物之间的行为差异
4. 用于验证计算预测的实验数据有限

当前研究表明,需要对每个特定的掺杂剂-氧化物对进行密度泛函理论模拟,以可靠地预测催化行为趋势。这突出了继续进行计算和实验研究的必要性,以发展对掺杂金属氧化物催化剂更全面的理解。
