[1] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO. Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase the OVFE;"

[2] "The third class consists of all the dopants from group 3 to group 7 of the periodic table (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Re, La, and Ce). We place them in one class because they all increase substantially the OVFE. All these dopants can form oxides in which their oxidation state is greater than 2."

[3] "We were unsuccessful in our attempts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with other properties of the dopants like: the ionization energy, the electronegativity, the chemical hardness, and the covalent or the ionic radius. Although some of these properties may be used for rationalizing trends in OVFE for a limited set of dopants, none of them are applicable for all the dopants."

[4] "At present, density functional simulations have to be performed for each particular dopant-oxide pair to obtain the trends in OVFE in a reliable manner."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) have different influences on the catalytic properties of metal oxides:

1. SVDs: Dopants like Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba, which have the same +2 oxidation state as Zn in ZnO, tend to increase the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE). This suggests they stabilize oxygen atoms and make it harder to create oxygen vacancies, potentially reducing catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

2. HVDs: Dopants from groups 3 to 7 of the periodic table (e.g., Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo) substantially increase OVFE. These dopants can form oxides with oxidation states higher than +2, leading to stronger metal-oxygen bonds and potentially altering the redox properties of the host oxide.

Computational studies have provided insights into how dopants affect OVFE and their preferred location in the oxide (surface vs. bulk). However, experimental studies comparing these computational predictions are not mentioned in the given text.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to:

1. Lack of correlation between OVFE and various dopant properties (e.g., ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, ionic radius).
2. Complex interplay of factors such as dopant size, oxidation state, and bond strength with oxygen.
3. Differences in crystal structure between the host oxide and the dopant's native oxide.

The text does not specifically address Lewis acid-base interactions or the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) in relation to dopant behavior. However, it emphasizes that density functional simulations must be performed for each specific dopant-oxide pair to obtain reliable trends in OVFE, highlighting the complexity and case-specific nature of dopant effects on metal oxide catalysts.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物的催化性能有不同的影响：

1. SVDs：像Mg、Ca、Sr和Ba这样的掺杂剂，与ZnO中的Zn具有相同的+2氧化态，倾向于增加氧空位形成能（OVFE）。这表明它们稳定了氧原子，使创建氧空位变得更困难，可能会降低氧化反应的催化活性。

2. HVDs：来自元素周期表第3至7族的掺杂剂（如Ti、V、Cr、Zr、Nb、Mo）大幅增加OVFE。这些掺杂剂可以形成氧化态高于+2的氧化物，导致更强的金属-氧键，并可能改变宿主氧化物的氧化还原性质。

计算研究提供了关于掺杂剂如何影响OVFE及其在氧化物中的优先位置（表面vs.体相）的见解。然而，文中没有提到比较这些计算预测的实验研究。

制定掺杂剂行为通用预测规则的挑战仍然存在，原因如下：

1. OVFE与各种掺杂剂性质（如电离能、电负性、化学硬度、离子半径）之间缺乏相关性。
2. 掺杂剂大小、氧化态和与氧的键强度等因素之间的复杂相互作用。
3. 宿主氧化物与掺杂剂本体氧化物之间的晶体结构差异。

文中没有具体讨论Lewis酸碱相互作用或宿主氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）与掺杂剂行为的关系。然而，它强调必须对每个特定的掺杂剂-氧化物对进行密度泛函模拟，以获得可靠的OVFE趋势，突出了掺杂剂对金属氧化物催化剂影响的复杂性和特殊性。
