[1] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO. Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase the OVFE"

[2] "The second class consists of Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba, which have the same formal charge in their oxides as Zn in ZnO (i.e., the stoichiometry of alkali-earth metal oxide is the same as that of ZnO). The presence of any of these dopants in place of Zn stabilizes the oxygen atoms (they make it harder to make an oxygen vacancy)."

[3] "The third class consists of all the dopants from group 3 to group 7 of the periodic table (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Re, La, and Ce). We place them in one class because they all increase substantially the OVFE. All these dopants can form oxides in which their oxidation state is greater than 2."

[4] "We were unsuccessful in our attempts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with other properties of the dopants like: the ionization energy, the electronegativity, the chemical hardness, and the covalent or the ionic radius. Although some of these properties may be used for rationalizing trends in OVFE for a limited set of dopants, none of them are applicable for all the dopants."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides differently:

SVDs (like Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) generally stabilize oxygen atoms in the host oxide, making it harder to form oxygen vacancies. This typically reduces the oxidative power of the oxide.

HVDs (such as Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Re, La, and Ce) substantially increase the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE), which also tends to decrease the oxidative power of the oxide. However, these dopants may activate gas-phase oxygen molecules, potentially enhancing other aspects of catalytic activity.

Computational studies have revealed that some dopants (like Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd) decrease OVFE and prefer to substitute surface atoms in ZnO, potentially improving its oxidative properties.

Despite these insights, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging. Attempts to correlate OVFE with properties such as ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, and ionic radius have been unsuccessful. The effects of dopants appear to be highly specific to each dopant-oxide pair, necessitating individual computational studies for reliable predictions.

Factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) likely play important roles, but their exact influences are not fully understood. The complexity of these systems and the lack of clear trends across all dopants highlight the need for further research to develop comprehensive predictive models for doped metal oxide catalysts.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对金属氧化物的催化性能有不同的影响：

SVDs(如Mg、Ca、Sr、Ba)通常会稳定宿主氧化物中的氧原子，使氧空位的形成更加困难。这通常会降低氧化物的氧化能力。

HVDs(如Sc、Ti、V、Cr、Mn、Y、Zr、Nb、Mo、Hf、Ta、W、Re、La和Ce)会大幅增加氧空位形成能(OVFE)，这也倾向于降低氧化物的氧化能力。然而，这些掺杂剂可能会活化气相氧分子，潜在地增强催化活性的其他方面。

计算研究表明，某些掺杂剂(如Li、Na、K、Rb、Cs、Os、Rh、Ir、Ni、Pd、Pt、Cu、Ag、Au和Cd)会降低OVFE，并倾向于替代ZnO表面原子，可能改善其氧化性能。

尽管有这些见解，制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则仍然具有挑战性。尝试将OVFE与电离能、电负性、化学硬度和离子半径等性质相关联的努力未能成功。掺杂剂的效果似乎高度特定于每个掺杂剂-氧化物对，需要进行单独的计算研究才能做出可靠的预测。

路易斯酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质(可还原vs.不可还原)等因素可能起重要作用，但它们的确切影响尚未完全理解。这些系统的复杂性和所有掺杂剂之间缺乏明确趋势突出了进一步研究的必要性，以开发掺杂金属氧化物催化剂的全面预测模型。
