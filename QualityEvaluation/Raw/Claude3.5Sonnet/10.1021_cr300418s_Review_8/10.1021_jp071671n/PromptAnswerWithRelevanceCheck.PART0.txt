<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) have different influences on the catalytic properties of metal oxides:

1. SVDs: Dopants like Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba, which have the same +2 oxidation state as Zn in ZnO, tend to increase the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE). This suggests they stabilize oxygen atoms and make it harder to create oxygen vacancies, potentially reducing catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

2. HVDs: Dopants from groups 3 to 7 of the periodic table (e.g., Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo) substantially increase OVFE. These dopants can form oxides with oxidation states higher than +2, leading to stronger metal-oxygen bonds and potentially altering the redox properties of the host oxide.

Computational studies have provided insights into how dopants affect OVFE and their preferred location in the oxide (surface vs. bulk). However, experimental studies comparing these computational predictions are not mentioned in the given text.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to:

1. Lack of correlation between OVFE and various dopant properties (e.g., ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, ionic radius).
2. Complex interplay of factors such as dopant size, oxidation state, and bond strength with oxygen.
3. Differences in crystal structure between the host oxide and the dopant's native oxide.

The text does not specifically address Lewis acid-base interactions or the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) in relation to dopant behavior. However, it emphasizes that density functional simulations must be performed for each specific dopant-oxide pair to obtain reliable trends in OVFE, highlighting the complexity and case-specific nature of dopant effects on metal oxide catalysts.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物的催化性能有不同的影响：

1. SVDs：像Mg、Ca、Sr和Ba这样的掺杂剂，与ZnO中的Zn具有相同的+2氧化态，倾向于增加氧空位形成能（OVFE）。这表明它们稳定了氧原子，使创建氧空位变得更困难，可能会降低氧化反应的催化活性。

2. HVDs：来自元素周期表第3至7族的掺杂剂（如Ti、V、Cr、Zr、Nb、Mo）大幅增加OVFE。这些掺杂剂可以形成氧化态高于+2的氧化物，导致更强的金属-氧键，并可能改变宿主氧化物的氧化还原性质。

计算研究提供了关于掺杂剂如何影响OVFE及其在氧化物中的优先位置（表面vs.体相）的见解。然而，文中没有提到比较这些计算预测的实验研究。

制定掺杂剂行为通用预测规则的挑战仍然存在，原因如下：

1. OVFE与各种掺杂剂性质（如电离能、电负性、化学硬度、离子半径）之间缺乏相关性。
2. 掺杂剂大小、氧化态和与氧的键强度等因素之间的复杂相互作用。
3. 宿主氧化物与掺杂剂本体氧化物之间的晶体结构差异。

文中没有具体讨论Lewis酸碱相互作用或宿主氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）与掺杂剂行为的关系。然而，它强调必须对每个特定的掺杂剂-氧化物对进行密度泛函模拟，以获得可靠的OVFE趋势，突出了掺杂剂对金属氧化物催化剂影响的复杂性和特殊性。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) have different effects on the catalytic properties of metal oxides:

SVDs like Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba generally increase the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) in ZnO, making it harder to create oxygen vacancies and potentially reducing catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

HVDs from groups 3-7 of the periodic table (e.g., Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Zr, Nb, Mo) also increase OVFE significantly. This is likely due to their ability to form stable oxides with higher oxidation states than the host oxide.

However, some dopants like alkali metals, Ag, and Au decrease OVFE, potentially enhancing catalytic activity by making surface oxygen more reactive.

Computational studies have provided insights into these trends, but forming general predictive rules remains challenging. Factors such as dopant size, oxide structure mismatch, and bond strength all play roles, but no single property correlates well with OVFE across all dopants.

The main challenges in formulating predictive rules include:

1. Complex interplay of multiple factors affecting dopant behavior
2. Lack of clear correlation between OVFE and common dopant properties
3. Differences in behavior between reducible and irreducible oxides
4. Limited experimental data to validate computational predictions

Current research suggests that density functional theory simulations are necessary for each specific dopant-oxide pair to reliably predict trends in catalytic behavior. This highlights the need for continued computational and experimental studies to develop a more comprehensive understanding of doped metal oxide catalysts.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对金属氧化物的催化性能有不同的影响:

同价掺杂剂如Mg、Ca、Sr和Ba通常会增加ZnO的氧空位形成能(OVFE),使得氧空位更难形成,可能会降低氧化反应的催化活性。

周期表第3-7族的高价掺杂剂(如Ti、V、Cr、Mn、Zr、Nb、Mo)也显著增加OVFE。这可能是因为它们能够形成比宿主氧化物具有更高氧化态的稳定氧化物。

然而,一些掺杂剂如碱金属、Ag和Au会降低OVFE,可能通过使表面氧更具反应性来增强催化活性。

计算研究为这些趋势提供了洞见,但形成普遍的预测规则仍然具有挑战性。掺杂剂大小、氧化物结构不匹配和键强度等因素都起作用,但没有单一属性在所有掺杂剂中与OVFE有良好的相关性。

制定预测规则的主要挑战包括:

1. 影响掺杂剂行为的多个因素之间的复杂相互作用
2. OVFE与常见掺杂剂性质之间缺乏明确的相关性
3. 可还原和不可还原氧化物之间的行为差异
4. 用于验证计算预测的实验数据有限

当前研究表明,需要对每个特定的掺杂剂-氧化物对进行密度泛函理论模拟,以可靠地预测催化行为趋势。这突出了继续进行计算和实验研究的必要性,以发展对掺杂金属氧化物催化剂更全面的理解。

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides differently:

SVDs (like Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) generally stabilize oxygen atoms in the host oxide, making it harder to form oxygen vacancies. This typically reduces the oxidative power of the oxide.

HVDs (such as Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Re, La, and Ce) substantially increase the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE), which also tends to decrease the oxidative power of the oxide. However, these dopants may activate gas-phase oxygen molecules, potentially enhancing other aspects of catalytic activity.

Computational studies have revealed that some dopants (like Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd) decrease OVFE and prefer to substitute surface atoms in ZnO, potentially improving its oxidative properties.

Despite these insights, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging. Attempts to correlate OVFE with properties such as ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, and ionic radius have been unsuccessful. The effects of dopants appear to be highly specific to each dopant-oxide pair, necessitating individual computational studies for reliable predictions.

Factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) likely play important roles, but their exact influences are not fully understood. The complexity of these systems and the lack of clear trends across all dopants highlight the need for further research to develop comprehensive predictive models for doped metal oxide catalysts.

路易斯酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质(可还原vs.不可还原)等因素可能起重要作用，但它们的确切影响尚未完全理解。这些系统的复杂性和所有掺杂剂之间缺乏明确趋势突出了进一步研究的必要性，以开发掺杂金属氧化物催化剂的全面预测模型。

1. SVDs (e.g., Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) generally increase the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) in ZnO, making oxygen removal more difficult and potentially reducing catalytic activity.

2. HVDs (e.g., Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Re, La, Ce) substantially increase OVFE in ZnO. This suggests they strengthen the oxygen-metal bond, which may decrease the oxide's oxidative power.

3. Some lower-valence dopants (e.g., Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and noble metals (e.g., Au, Ag, Pt, Pd) decrease OVFE, potentially enhancing catalytic activity by making oxygen more readily available.

Computational studies have provided insights into these trends, but formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging. The study found no consistent correlation between OVFE and properties such as ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, or atomic radius across all dopants.

Challenges in predicting dopant behavior include:

1. Complex interplay of factors affecting OVFE, including electronic structure, coordination environment, and lattice distortions.

2. Lack of universally applicable trends across different dopant types and host oxides.

3. Need for case-by-case density functional theory simulations to reliably predict OVFE trends for specific dopant-oxide pairs.

The study does not explicitly address Lewis acid-base interactions or differences between reducible and irreducible oxides. However, the varying effects of dopants on OVFE suggest that these factors may play a role in determining catalytic properties. Further research is needed to elucidate these relationships and develop more comprehensive predictive models for dopant behavior in metal oxide catalysts.

预测掺杂剂行为的挑战包括：

1. 影响OVFE的因素复杂交织，包括电子结构、配位环境和晶格畸变。

2. 不同掺杂剂类型和宿主氧化物之间缺乏普遍适用的趋势。

3. 需要逐案进行密度泛函理论模拟，以可靠地预测特定掺杂剂-氧化物对的OVFE趋势。

该研究没有明确讨论路易斯酸碱相互作用或可还原和不可还原氧化物之间的差异。然而，掺杂剂对OVFE的不同影响表明，这些因素可能在决定催化性能中起作用。需要进一步研究来阐明这些关系，并为金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂剂行为开发更全面的预测模型。

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) generally influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides by affecting the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE). HVDs like Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, etc., tend to increase OVFE, which suggests they strengthen the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide. This could potentially make the oxide less active for oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

Computational studies, particularly density functional theory (DFT) calculations, have been crucial in understanding these effects. They have revealed that the impact of dopants on OVFE varies significantly and depends on the specific dopant-oxide pair. This highlights the complexity of dopant behavior and the difficulty in formulating general predictive rules.

Challenges in predicting dopant behavior persist due to the lack of clear correlations between OVFE and various properties of the dopants, such as ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, and ionic radius. This complexity necessitates individual DFT simulations for each dopant-oxide combination to reliably predict trends in OVFE.

The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) likely plays a role in dopant behavior, but the literature provided does not give specific insights into this aspect. Similarly, while Lewis acid-base interactions may be important, they are not explicitly discussed in the given text.

Despite these challenges, the research suggests that among the many possible dopant-oxide host pairs, there is potential for discovering promising oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts. This encourages further exploration and experimental studies in this field.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)通常通过影响氧空位形成能(OVFE)来改变金属氧化物的催化性质。高价掺杂剂如Ti、Zr、Hf、V、Nb、Ta等往往会增加OVFE，这表明它们加强了表面氧与氧化物之间的键合。这可能会使氧化物在遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制的氧化反应中活性降低。

计算研究，特别是密度泛函理论(DFT)计算，在理解这些效应方面起到了关键作用。它们揭示了掺杂剂对OVFE的影响差异很大，并且取决于特定的掺杂剂-氧化物对。这突显了掺杂剂行为的复杂性和制定一般预测规则的困难。

由于OVFE与掺杂剂的各种性质（如电离能、电负性、化学硬度和离子半径）之间缺乏明确的相关性，预测掺杂剂行为的挑战依然存在。这种复杂性需要对每个掺杂剂-氧化物组合进行单独的DFT模拟，以可靠地预测OVFE的趋势。

宿主氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）可能在掺杂剂行为中起作用，但所提供的文献并未对这一方面提供具体见解。同样，虽然Lewis酸碱相互作用可能很重要，但在给定的文本中并未明确讨论。

尽管存在这些挑战，研究表明在众多可能的掺杂剂-氧化物宿主对中，存在发现有前景的氧化和氧化脱氢催化剂的潜力。这鼓励了该领域的进一步探索和实验研究。
