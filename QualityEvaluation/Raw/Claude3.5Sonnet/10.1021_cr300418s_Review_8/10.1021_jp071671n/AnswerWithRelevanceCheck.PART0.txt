          [1] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO. Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase the OVFE;"

[2] "The third class consists of all the dopants from group 3 to group 7 of the periodic table (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Re, La, and Ce). We place them in one class because they all increase substantially the OVFE. All these dopants can form oxides in which their oxidation state is greater than 2."

[3] "We were unsuccessful in our attempts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with other properties of the dopants like: the ionization energy, the electronegativity, the chemical hardness, and the covalent or the ionic radius. Although some of these properties may be used for rationalizing trends in OVFE for a limited set of dopants, none of them are applicable for all the dopants."

[4] "At present, density functional simulations have to be performed for each particular dopant-oxide pair to obtain the trends in OVFE in a reliable manner."

[5] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."

          Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides differently:

1. SVDs (e.g., Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) generally increase the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) in ZnO, making oxygen removal more difficult and potentially reducing catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

2. HVDs (e.g., Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Re, La, Ce) substantially increase OVFE in ZnO. This suggests they strengthen the oxygen-metal bond, which may decrease the oxide's oxidative power.

3. Some lower-valence dopants (e.g., Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and noble metals (e.g., Au, Ag, Pt, Pd) decrease OVFE, potentially enhancing catalytic activity by making oxygen more readily available for reactions.

Computational studies, particularly density functional theory (DFT) calculations, have been crucial in understanding these effects. They have revealed that the impact of dopants on OVFE varies significantly and depends on the specific dopant-oxide pair. This highlights the complexity of dopant behavior and the difficulty in formulating general predictive rules.

Challenges in predicting dopant behavior persist due to:
1. Lack of clear correlations between OVFE and various properties of the dopants (e.g., ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, ionic radius).
2. Complex interplay of factors affecting OVFE, including electronic structure, coordination environment, and lattice distortions.
3. Need for case-by-case density functional theory simulations to reliably predict OVFE trends for specific dopant-oxide pairs.

The study does not explicitly address Lewis acid-base interactions or differences between reducible and irreducible oxides. However, the varying effects of dopants on OVFE suggest that these factors may play a role in determining catalytic properties. Further research is needed to elucidate these relationships and develop more comprehensive predictive models for dopant behavior in metal oxide catalysts.

          同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对金属氧化物的催化性能有不同的影响：

1. SVDs（如Mg、Ca、Sr、Ba）通常会增加ZnO中的氧空位形成能（OVFE），使氧的移除更加困难，可能会降低氧化反应的催化活性。

2. HVDs（如Sc、Ti、V、Cr、Mn、Y、Zr、Nb、Mo、Hf、Ta、W、Re、La、Ce）显著增加ZnO中的OVFE。这表明它们增强了氧-金属键，可能会降低氧化物的氧化能力。

3. 一些低价掺杂剂（如Li、Na、K、Rb、Cs）和贵金属（如Au、Ag、Pt、Pd）会降低OVFE，可能通过使氧更容易获得来增强催化活性。

计算研究，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，在理解这些效应方面起到了关键作用。它们揭示了掺杂剂对OVFE的影响差异很大，并且取决于特定的掺杂剂-氧化物对。这突显了掺杂剂行为的复杂性和制定一般预测规则的困难。

预测掺杂剂行为的挑战持续存在，原因包括：
1. OVFE与掺杂剂的各种性质（如电离能、电负性、化学硬度和离子半径）之间缺乏明确的相关性。
2. 影响OVFE的因素复杂交织，包括电子结构、配位环境和晶格畸变。
3. 需要逐案进行密度泛函理论模拟，以可靠地预测特定掺杂剂-氧化物对的OVFE趋势。

该研究没有明确讨论路易斯酸碱相互作用或可还原和不可还原氧化物之间的差异。然而，掺杂剂对OVFE的不同影响表明，这些因素可能在决定催化性能中起作用。需要进一步研究来阐明这些关系，并为金属氧化物催化剂中的掺杂剂行为开发更全面的预测模型。
