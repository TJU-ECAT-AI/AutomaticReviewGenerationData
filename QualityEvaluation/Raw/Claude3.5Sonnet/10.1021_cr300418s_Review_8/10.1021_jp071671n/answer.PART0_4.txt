Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) generally influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides by affecting the oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE). HVDs like Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, etc., tend to increase OVFE, which suggests they strengthen the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide. This could potentially make the oxide less active for oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

Computational studies, particularly density functional theory (DFT) calculations, have been crucial in understanding these effects. They have revealed that the impact of dopants on OVFE varies significantly and depends on the specific dopant-oxide pair. This highlights the complexity of dopant behavior and the difficulty in formulating general predictive rules.

Challenges in predicting dopant behavior persist due to the lack of clear correlations between OVFE and various properties of the dopants, such as ionization energy, electronegativity, chemical hardness, and ionic radius. This complexity necessitates individual DFT simulations for each dopant-oxide combination to reliably predict trends in OVFE.

The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) likely plays a role in dopant behavior, but the literature provided does not give specific insights into this aspect. Similarly, while Lewis acid-base interactions may be important, they are not explicitly discussed in the given text.

Despite these challenges, the research suggests that among the many possible dopant-oxide host pairs, there is potential for discovering promising oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts. This encourages further exploration and experimental studies in this field.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)通常通过影响氧空位形成能(OVFE)来改变金属氧化物的催化性质。高价掺杂剂如Ti、Zr、Hf、V、Nb、Ta等往往会增加OVFE，这表明它们加强了表面氧与氧化物之间的键合。这可能会使氧化物在遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制的氧化反应中活性降低。

计算研究，特别是密度泛函理论(DFT)计算，在理解这些效应方面起到了关键作用。它们揭示了掺杂剂对OVFE的影响差异很大，并且取决于特定的掺杂剂-氧化物对。这突显了掺杂剂行为的复杂性和制定一般预测规则的困难。

由于OVFE与掺杂剂的各种性质（如电离能、电负性、化学硬度和离子半径）之间缺乏明确的相关性，预测掺杂剂行为的挑战依然存在。这种复杂性需要对每个掺杂剂-氧化物组合进行单独的DFT模拟，以可靠地预测OVFE的趋势。

宿主氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）可能在掺杂剂行为中起作用，但所提供的文献并未对这一方面提供具体见解。同样，虽然Lewis酸碱相互作用可能很重要，但在给定的文本中并未明确讨论。

尽管存在这些挑战，研究表明在众多可能的掺杂剂-氧化物宿主对中，存在发现有前景的氧化和氧化脱氢催化剂的潜力。这鼓励了该领域的进一步探索和实验研究。
