[1] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

[2] "Doping rutile TiO2 (110) with Ru, Sn, Mn, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, or Au substantially lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, whereas doping with Zr and Hf causes practically no change. Doping CeO2 (111) with Au, Cu, and Ag also lowers the energy of vacancy formation. However, this effect is not universal; (56) doping ZnO (1010) with Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, or Ta very substantially increases the energy of vacancy formation."

[3] "Doping TiO2 (110) with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of vacancy formation, and doping with W leaves it practically unchanged. The energy of vacancy formation is lowered even more when V, Cr, W, or Mo bind an oxygen atom to form a MO group (which replaces a Ti atom at the surface of the oxide). The doped oxides studied here are better oxidants than rutile TiO2 (110)."

[4] "Our premise was that in many systems the presence of a well-chosen dopant weakens the bond of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increases their chemical activity. Therefore, such a doped oxide is a better oxidant than the undoped one, and it is more likely to engage in an oxidation reaction by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which a surface oxygen atom oxidizes a reagent and is removed from the surface leaving behind an oxygen vacancy."

[5] "If we speculate that this relationship holds for the systems studied here, then we can make some guesses regarding the activity of these doped oxides. Table 4 shows that the energy of CO2 desorption, by carbonate decomposition, and the energy of the reaction of CO with the adsorbed oxygen do not change when we change the catalyst; these reactions will not differentiate between catalysts. The catalysts will differ through their ability to adsorb CO on the surface and their ability to adsorb O2 at an oxygen vacancy site."

The study provides insights into how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides:

1. For TiO2, both SVDs (Mn, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au) and HVDs (V, Cr, Mo, W) generally lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, making the doped oxides better oxidants than undoped TiO2. This effect is even more pronounced when HVDs like V, Cr, W, or Mo bind an additional oxygen atom to form a MO group.

2. For CeO2, doping with Au, Cu, and Ag (SVDs) also lowers the energy of vacancy formation.

3. However, this trend is not universal. In ZnO, HVDs (Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta) substantially increase the energy of vacancy formation, potentially making the doped oxide a poorer oxidant.

These findings suggest that the effect of dopants on catalytic properties depends on the nature of the host oxide. For reducible oxides like TiO2 and CeO2, both SVDs and HVDs can enhance oxidation catalysis by facilitating oxygen vacancy formation. However, for less reducible oxides like ZnO, HVDs may inhibit oxidation catalysis.

The study also reveals that the catalytic performance of doped oxides in CO oxidation is primarily differentiated by two factors: the ability to adsorb CO on the surface and the ability to adsorb O2 at an oxygen vacancy site. Both of these factors are related to the energy of vacancy formation, which serves as a useful descriptor for predicting catalytic activity.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to the complex interplay between the dopant, the host oxide, and the specific reaction mechanism. Factors such as the reducibility of the host oxide, the valence state of the dopant, and the local electronic structure around the dopant site all play crucial roles in determining the overall catalytic performance. Additionally, the study suggests that considering spin conservation rules in reaction mechanisms may be important for accurately predicting catalytic behavior, adding another layer of complexity to the development of predictive models.

该研究为同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能提供了以下见解：

1. 对于TiO2，SVDs（Mn、Ni、Pd、Pt、Cu、Ag、Au）和HVDs（V、Cr、Mo、W）通常都会降低氧空位形成能，使掺杂氧化物成为比未掺杂TiO2更好的氧化剂。当HVDs如V、Cr、W或Mo与额外的氧原子结合形成MO基团时，这种效果更加显著。

2. 对于CeO2，用Au、Cu和Ag（SVDs）掺杂也会降低空位形成能。

3. 然而，这种趋势并非普遍。在ZnO中，HVDs（Sc、Y、La、Ti、Zr、Hf、Ce、V、Nb、Ta）会大幅增加空位形成能，可能使掺杂氧化物成为较差的氧化剂。

这些发现表明，掺杂剂对催化性能的影响取决于宿主氧化物的性质。对于可还原的氧化物如TiO2和CeO2，SVDs和HVDs都可以通过促进氧空位形成来增强氧化催化。然而，对于较难还原的氧化物如ZnO，HVDs可能会抑制氧化催化。

研究还揭示，掺杂氧化物在CO氧化中的催化性能主要由两个因素区分：在表面吸附CO的能力和在氧空位处吸附O2的能力。这两个因素都与空位形成能有关，空位形成能可作为预测催化活性的有用描述符。

由于掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和特定反应机理之间的复杂相互作用，制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则仍然面临挑战。宿主氧化物的可还原性、掺杂剂的价态以及掺杂位点周围的局部电子结构等因素都在决定整体催化性能中起着关键作用。此外，研究表明，在反应机理中考虑自旋守恒规则对于准确预测催化行为可能很重要，这为预测模型的开发增加了另一层复杂性。
