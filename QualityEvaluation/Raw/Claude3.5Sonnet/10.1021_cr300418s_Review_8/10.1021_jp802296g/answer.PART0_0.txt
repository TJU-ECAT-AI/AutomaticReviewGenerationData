[1] "There are indications, from theory and experiment, that substitutionally doped oxides might be a class of interesting partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts."

[2] "More important to us are papers that set out to prepare doped oxides to use as catalysts or to make the host oxide a better oxidant."

[3] "Most among these papers found that doping lowers the temperature at which the oxide is reduced by CO or H2. Those who studied a catalytic reaction found that doping improves the catalytic activity of the host oxide."

[4] "Doping is not always beneficial. Ceria doped with Sm, Gd, La, Nb, and Ta has lower activity toward n-butane oxidation than ceria alone, and doping ceria with La, Pr, Gd, or Nb slows down CO oxidation."

[5] "Our premise was that in many systems the presence of a well-chosen dopant weakens the bond of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increases their chemical activity. Therefore, such a doped oxide is a better oxidant than the undoped one, and it is more likely to engage in an oxidation reaction by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism"

[6] "In previous work we have found that doping ZnO with metal atoms having a higher valence than Zn will increase the energy of vacancy formation. Surprisingly, this is not the case for the systems studied here. Doping TiO2 (110) with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of vacancy formation, and doping with W leaves it practically unchanged."

[7] "The doped oxides studied here are better oxidants than rutile TiO2 (110)."

The literature provides insights into how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides:

1. Generally, doping oxides can improve their catalytic activity for partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Many studies have found that doping lowers the reduction temperature of oxides by CO or H2 and improves catalytic activity.

2. The effect of dopants depends on the specific oxide and reaction. For example, while doping improved catalytic activity in many cases, doping ceria with certain elements (Sm, Gd, La, Nb, Ta) decreased its activity for n-butane oxidation and CO oxidation.

3. Well-chosen dopants can weaken the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface, increasing chemical activity and making the doped oxide a better oxidant. This can promote oxidation reactions via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

4. Contrary to expectations based on previous work with ZnO, doping TiO2 with high-valence dopants (V, Cr, Mo, Mn) lowered the energy of vacancy formation, making them better oxidants than undoped TiO2. This highlights the challenges in formulating general rules for dopant behavior.

5. The effect of dopants depends on factors like the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) and Lewis acid-base interactions. The unexpected results with TiO2 compared to ZnO demonstrate that dopant behavior can vary significantly between different oxide systems.

6. Computational studies have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms by which dopants affect catalytic properties, such as oxygen vacancy formation energies and surface oxygen reactivity. However, challenges remain in developing universal predictive rules due to the complex interplay of factors involved.

In summary, while doping can often enhance catalytic properties, the effects are highly dependent on the specific oxide-dopant combination and the reaction of interest. Further research is needed to fully understand and predict dopant behavior across different oxide systems.

文献为同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能提供了见解:

1. 通常，掺杂氧化物可以提高其部分氧化和氧化脱氢反应的催化活性。许多研究发现，掺杂降低了氧化物被CO或H2还原的温度，并提高了催化活性。

2. 掺杂剂的效果取决于特定的氧化物和反应。例如，虽然在许多情况下掺杂提高了催化活性，但用某些元素(Sm, Gd, La, Nb, Ta)掺杂氧化铈反而降低了其对正丁烷氧化和CO氧化的活性。

3. 精心选择的掺杂剂可以削弱邻近氧原子与表面的键合，增加化学活性，使掺杂氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。这可以通过Mars-van Krevelen机制促进氧化反应。

4. 与之前在ZnO上的工作所预期的相反，用高价掺杂剂(V, Cr, Mo, Mn)掺杂TiO2降低了氧空位形成能，使它们成为比未掺杂TiO2更好的氧化剂。这突出了在制定掺杂剂行为一般规则时所面临的挑战。

5. 掺杂剂的效果取决于宿主氧化物的性质(可还原vs.不可还原)和路易斯酸碱相互作用等因素。与ZnO相比，TiO2的意外结果表明，掺杂剂的行为在不同的氧化物系统之间可能有显著差异。

6. 计算研究为掺杂剂影响催化性能的机制提供了宝贵的见解，如氧空位形成能和表面氧反应性。然而，由于涉及因素的复杂相互作用，开发通用预测规则仍然面临挑战。

总之，虽然掺杂通常可以增强催化性能，但其效果高度依赖于特定的氧化物-掺杂剂组合和所关注的反应。需要进一步研究以充分理解和预测不同氧化物系统中掺杂剂的行为。
