[1] "There are indications, from theory and experiment, that substitutionally doped oxides might be a class of interesting partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts."

[2] "Doping is not always beneficial. Ceria doped with Sm, Gd, La, Nb, and Ta has lower activity toward n-butane oxidation than ceria alone, and doping ceria with La, Pr, Gd, or Nb slows down CO oxidation."

[3] "Our premise was that in many systems the presence of a well-chosen dopant weakens the bond of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increases their chemical activity. Therefore, such a doped oxide is a better oxidant than the undoped one, and it is more likely to engage in an oxidation reaction by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism"

[4] "Doping rutile TiO2 (110) with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of vacancy formation, and doping with W leaves it practically unchanged. The energy of vacancy formation is lowered even more when V, Cr, W, or Mo bind an oxygen atom to form a MO group (which replaces a Ti atom at the surface of the oxide). The doped oxides studied here are better oxidants than rutile TiO2 (110)."

[5] "In previous work we have found that doping ZnO with metal atoms having a higher valence than Zn will increase the energy of vacancy formation. Surprisingly, this is not the case for the systems studied here."

The literature provides insights into how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides:

1. Substitutional doping can create interesting catalysts for partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The effects of doping are not always beneficial. For example, doping ceria with certain elements (Sm, Gd, La, Nb, Ta) decreases its activity for n-butane oxidation and CO oxidation.

3. Well-chosen dopants can weaken the bond between neighboring oxygen atoms and the surface, increasing chemical activity and making the doped oxide a better oxidant. This can promote oxidation reactions via the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism.

4. For rutile TiO2(110), doping with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of vacancy formation, making these doped oxides better oxidants than undoped TiO2. Doping with W has little effect on vacancy formation energy.

5. The behavior of HVDs can be counterintuitive and oxide-dependent. While doping ZnO with higher valence metals increases vacancy formation energy, this is not observed for the TiO2 systems studied here.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The complex interplay between dopant properties, host oxide characteristics, and specific reaction mechanisms.

2. Inconsistent effects of doping across different oxide systems (e.g., ZnO vs. TiO2).

3. The need to consider factors beyond simple valence comparisons, such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide.

4. The difficulty in predicting how dopants will affect key properties like oxygen vacancy formation energy across different oxide systems.

To develop more reliable predictive rules, further computational and experimental studies are needed across a wider range of oxide systems and dopants, with careful consideration of electronic structure, defect chemistry, and surface reactivity.

文献为我们提供了关于同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）如何影响不同金属氧化物催化性能的见解：

1. 替代性掺杂可以创造出有趣的部分氧化和氧化脱氢反应催化剂。

2. 掺杂的效果并不总是有益的。例如，用某些元素（Sm、Gd、La、Nb、Ta）掺杂氧化铈会降低其对正丁烷氧化和CO氧化的活性。

3. 精心选择的掺杂剂可以削弱相邻氧原子与表面之间的键合，增加化学活性，使掺杂氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。这可以通过Mars–van Krevelen机制促进氧化反应。

4. 对于金红石TiO2(110)，用V、Cr、Mo和Mn掺杂会降低空位形成能，使这些掺杂氧化物成为比未掺杂TiO2更好的氧化剂。用W掺杂对空位形成能的影响很小。

5. HVDs的行为可能违反直觉且依赖于氧化物。虽然用高价金属掺杂ZnO会增加空位形成能，但在这里研究的TiO2系统中没有观察到这种现象。

制定掺杂剂行为通用预测规则的挑战包括：

1. 掺杂剂性质、宿主氧化物特性和特定反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。

2. 在不同氧化物系统中掺杂效果的不一致性（例如，ZnO与TiO2）。

3. 需要考虑简单价态比较之外的因素，如路易斯酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的可还原性。

4. 难以预测掺杂剂如何影响不同氧化物系统中的关键性质，如氧空位形成能。

为了制定更可靠的预测规则，需要在更广泛的氧化物系统和掺杂剂范围内进行进一步的计算和实验研究，同时仔细考虑电子结构、缺陷化学和表面反应活性。
