[1] "There are indications, from theory and experiment, that substitutionally doped oxides might be a class of interesting partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts."

[2] "More important to us are papers that set out to prepare doped oxides to use as catalysts or to make the host oxide a better oxidant."

[3] "Most among these papers found that doping lowers the temperature at which the oxide is reduced by CO or H2. Those who studied a catalytic reaction found that doping improves the catalytic activity of the host oxide."

[4] "Doping is not always beneficial. Ceria doped with Sm, Gd, La, Nb, and Ta has lower activity toward n-butane oxidation than ceria alone, and doping ceria with La, Pr, Gd, or Nb slows down CO oxidation."

[5] "Our premise was that in many systems the presence of a well-chosen dopant weakens the bond of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increases their chemical activity. Therefore, such a doped oxide is a better oxidant than the undoped one, and it is more likely to engage in an oxidation reaction by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism"

[6] "In previous work we have found that doping ZnO with metal atoms having a higher valence than Zn will increase the energy of vacancy formation. Surprisingly, this is not the case for the systems studied here. Doping TiO2 (110) with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of vacancy formation, and doping with W leaves it practically unchanged."

[7] "The doped oxides studied here are better oxidants than rutile TiO2 (110)."

The literature provides insights into how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides:

1. Generally, doping oxides can improve their catalytic activity for partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Many studies have found that doping lowers the reduction temperature of oxides by CO or H2 and improves catalytic activity.

2. The effect of dopants depends on the specific oxide and reaction. For example, while doping improved catalytic activity in many cases, doping ceria with certain elements (Sm, Gd, La, Nb, Ta) decreased its activity for n-butane oxidation and CO oxidation.

3. Well-chosen dopants can weaken the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface, increasing chemical activity and making the doped oxide a better oxidant. This can promote oxidation reactions via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

4. Contrary to expectations based on previous work with ZnO, doping TiO2 with high-valence dopants (V, Cr, Mo, Mn) lowered the energy of vacancy formation, making them better oxidants than undoped TiO2. This highlights the challenges in formulating general rules for dopant behavior.

5. The effect of dopants depends on factors like the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) and Lewis acid-base interactions. The unexpected results with TiO2 compared to ZnO demonstrate that dopant behavior can vary significantly between different oxide systems.

6. Computational studies have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms by which dopants affect catalytic properties, such as oxygen vacancy formation energies and surface oxygen reactivity. However, challenges remain in developing universal predictive rules due to the complex interplay of factors involved.

In summary, while doping can often enhance catalytic properties, the effects are highly dependent on the specific oxide-dopant combination and the reaction of interest. Further research is needed to fully understand and predict dopant behavior across different oxide systems.

文献为同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能提供了见解:

1. 通常，掺杂氧化物可以提高其部分氧化和氧化脱氢反应的催化活性。许多研究发现，掺杂降低了氧化物被CO或H2还原的温度，并提高了催化活性。

2. 掺杂剂的效果取决于特定的氧化物和反应。例如，虽然在许多情况下掺杂提高了催化活性，但用某些元素(Sm, Gd, La, Nb, Ta)掺杂氧化铈反而降低了其对正丁烷氧化和CO氧化的活性。

3. 精心选择的掺杂剂可以削弱邻近氧原子与表面的键合，增加化学活性，使掺杂氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。这可以通过Mars-van Krevelen机制促进氧化反应。

4. 与之前在ZnO上的工作所预期的相反，用高价掺杂剂(V, Cr, Mo, Mn)掺杂TiO2降低了氧空位形成能，使它们成为比未掺杂TiO2更好的氧化剂。这突出了在制定掺杂剂行为一般规则时所面临的挑战。

5. 掺杂剂的效果取决于宿主氧化物的性质(可还原vs.不可还原)和路易斯酸碱相互作用等因素。与ZnO相比，TiO2的意外结果表明，掺杂剂的行为在不同的氧化物系统之间可能有显著差异。

6. 计算研究为掺杂剂影响催化性能的机制提供了宝贵的见解，如氧空位形成能和表面氧反应性。然而，由于涉及因素的复杂相互作用，开发通用预测规则仍然面临挑战。

总之，虽然掺杂通常可以增强催化性能，但其效果高度依赖于特定的氧化物-掺杂剂组合和所关注的反应。需要进一步研究以充分理解和预测不同氧化物系统中掺杂剂的行为。

[1] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

[2] "Doping TiO2 (110) with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of vacancy formation, and doping with W leaves it practically unchanged. The energy of vacancy formation is lowered even more when V, Cr, W, or Mo bind an oxygen atom to form a MO group (which replaces a Ti atom at the surface of the oxide)."

[3] "In previous work (56) we have found that doping ZnO with metal atoms having a higher valence than Zn will increase the energy of vacancy formation. Surprisingly, this is not the case for the systems studied here."

[4] "The only substantial difference between (VO)xTi1xO2 (110) and AuxTi1xO2 (110) is that the former adsorbs CO to make a carbonate (with the oxygens at b1 and b2) and the latter adsorbs CO perpendicular to the surface on top of the oxygen at b2."

[5] "It is unclear at present for which systems such errors exist, how large they are, or which quantities are described erroneously. However, we are interested here in qualitative questions: (1) is the energy of vacancy formation a good qualitative descriptor of oxidation catalysis by the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism? (2) Which doped oxide is a better catalyst? (3) Is there a wide variability in the chemistry of doped oxides (which would indicate that a study of various dopants is worthwhile)?"

The computational study provides several insights into how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides:

1. For TiO2, both SVDs and HVDs (V, Cr, Mo, Mn, W) generally lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, making the doped oxides better oxidants than undoped TiO2. This effect is more pronounced when V, Cr, W, or Mo bind an additional oxygen atom to form an MO group.

2. This behavior contrasts with previous findings for ZnO, where HVDs increased the energy of vacancy formation. This suggests that the effect of dopants can vary significantly between different host oxides.

3. The study found that the energy of vacancy formation (ΔEv2) is a good descriptor for oxidation catalysis by the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in these systems. The energies of key reaction steps (CO adsorption and O2 adsorption at vacancy sites) showed linear relationships with ΔEv2.

4. Different dopants can lead to varied reaction mechanisms. For example, VO-doped TiO2 adsorbs CO to form a carbonate, while Au-doped TiO2 adsorbs CO perpendicular to the surface.

5. The study highlights the complexity of predicting dopant behavior, as the effects can differ between host oxides (e.g., TiO2 vs. ZnO) and depend on factors such as the dopant's ability to take multiple valence states.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The need to consider the specific properties of both the dopant and the host oxide, as effects can vary between different systems.

2. The potential limitations of DFT calculations in accurately describing the energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and doped oxide chemistry, especially for narrow band oxides like TiO2.

3. The complexity of real catalytic systems, which may have ill-defined structures and compositions compared to the idealized models used in computational studies.

To address these challenges, further experimental validation and more advanced theoretical methods may be needed to develop more robust predictive rules for dopant behavior across a wider range of oxide systems.

这项计算研究为同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)如何影响金属氧化物的催化性能提供了几个洞见：

1. 对于TiO2，SVDs和HVDs（V、Cr、Mo、Mn、W）通常都会降低氧空位形成能，使掺杂氧化物成为比未掺杂TiO2更好的氧化剂。当V、Cr、W或Mo与额外的氧原子结合形成MO基团时，这种效果更为显著。

2. 这种行为与之前对ZnO的发现形成对比，在ZnO中HVDs增加了空位形成能。这表明掺杂剂的效果在不同的宿主氧化物之间可能存在显著差异。

3. 研究发现，在这些系统中，空位形成能（ΔEv2）是Mars-van Krevelen机制氧化催化的良好描述符。关键反应步骤（CO吸附和O2在空位处的吸附）的能量与ΔEv2呈线性关系。

4. 不同的掺杂剂可能导致不同的反应机制。例如，VO掺杂的TiO2吸附CO形成碳酸盐，而Au掺杂的TiO2垂直吸附CO到表面上。

5. 研究强调了预测掺杂剂行为的复杂性，因为效果可能因宿主氧化物（如TiO2与ZnO）而异，并取决于掺杂剂能够采取多种价态等因素。

制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战包括：

1. 需要考虑掺杂剂和宿主氧化物的具体性质，因为效果可能在不同系统之间有所不同。

2. DFT计算在准确描述氧空位形成能量和掺杂氧化物化学性质方面的潜在局限性，特别是对于像TiO2这样的窄带氧化物。

3. 实际催化系统的复杂性，与计算研究中使用的理想化模型相比，可能具有不明确的结构和成分。

为了应对这些挑战，可能需要进一步的实验验证和更先进的理论方法，以在更广泛的氧化物系统中开发更强大的掺杂剂行为预测规则。

The literature provides insights into how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides:

1. Substitutional doping can create interesting catalysts for partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The effects of doping are not always beneficial. For example, doping ceria with certain elements (Sm, Gd, La, Nb, Ta) decreases its activity for n-butane oxidation and CO oxidation.

3. Well-chosen dopants can weaken the bond between neighboring oxygen atoms and the surface, increasing chemical activity and making the doped oxide a better oxidant. This can promote oxidation reactions via the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism.

4. For rutile TiO2(110), doping with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of vacancy formation, making these doped oxides better oxidants than undoped TiO2. Doping with W has little effect on vacancy formation energy.

5. The behavior of HVDs can be counterintuitive and oxide-dependent. While doping ZnO with higher valence metals increases vacancy formation energy, this is not observed for the TiO2 systems studied here.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The complex interplay between dopant properties, host oxide characteristics, and specific reaction mechanisms.

2. Inconsistent effects of doping across different oxide systems (e.g., ZnO vs. TiO2).

3. The need to consider factors beyond simple valence comparisons, such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the reducibility of the host oxide.

4. The difficulty in predicting how dopants will affect key properties like oxygen vacancy formation energy across different oxide systems.

To develop more reliable predictive rules, further computational and experimental studies are needed across a wider range of oxide systems and dopants, with careful consideration of electronic structure, defect chemistry, and surface reactivity.

[2] "Doping rutile TiO2 (110) with Ru, Sn, Mn, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, or Au substantially lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, whereas doping with Zr and Hf causes practically no change. Doping CeO2 (111) with Au, Cu, and Ag also lowers the energy of vacancy formation. However, this effect is not universal; (56) doping ZnO (1010) with Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, or Ta very substantially increases the energy of vacancy formation."

[3] "Doping TiO2 (110) with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of vacancy formation, and doping with W leaves it practically unchanged. The energy of vacancy formation is lowered even more when V, Cr, W, or Mo bind an oxygen atom to form a MO group (which replaces a Ti atom at the surface of the oxide).

[5] "If we speculate that this relationship holds for the systems studied here, then we can make some guesses regarding the activity of these doped oxides. Table 4 shows that the energy of CO2 desorption, by carbonate decomposition, and the energy of the reaction of CO with the adsorbed oxygen do not change when we change the catalyst; these reactions will not differentiate between catalysts. The catalysts will differ through their ability to adsorb CO on the surface and their ability to adsorb O2 at an oxygen vacancy site."

The study provides insights into how same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides:

1. For TiO2, both SVDs (Mn, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au) and HVDs (V, Cr, Mo, W) generally lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, making the doped oxides better oxidants than undoped TiO2. This effect is even more pronounced when HVDs like V, Cr, W, or Mo bind an additional oxygen atom to form a MO group.

2. For CeO2, doping with Au, Cu, and Ag (SVDs) also lowers the energy of vacancy formation.

3. However, this trend is not universal. In ZnO, HVDs (Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta) substantially increase the energy of vacancy formation, potentially making the doped oxide a poorer oxidant.

These findings suggest that the effect of dopants on catalytic properties depends on the nature of the host oxide. For reducible oxides like TiO2 and CeO2, both SVDs and HVDs can enhance oxidation catalysis by facilitating oxygen vacancy formation. However, for less reducible oxides like ZnO, HVDs may inhibit oxidation catalysis.

The study also reveals that the catalytic performance of doped oxides in CO oxidation is primarily differentiated by two factors: the ability to adsorb CO on the surface and the ability to adsorb O2 at an oxygen vacancy site. Both of these factors are related to the energy of vacancy formation, which serves as a useful descriptor for predicting catalytic activity.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to the complex interplay between the dopant, the host oxide, and the specific reaction mechanism. Factors such as the reducibility of the host oxide, the valence state of the dopant, and the local electronic structure around the dopant site all play crucial roles in determining the overall catalytic performance. Additionally, the study suggests that considering spin conservation rules in reaction mechanisms may be important for accurately predicting catalytic behavior, adding another layer of complexity to the development of predictive models.

该研究为同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能提供了以下见解：

1. 对于TiO2，SVDs（Mn、Ni、Pd、Pt、Cu、Ag、Au）和HVDs（V、Cr、Mo、W）通常都会降低氧空位形成能，使掺杂氧化物成为比未掺杂TiO2更好的氧化剂。当HVDs如V、Cr、W或Mo与额外的氧原子结合形成MO基团时，这种效果更加显著。

2. 对于CeO2，用Au、Cu和Ag（SVDs）掺杂也会降低空位形成能。

3. 然而，这种趋势并非普遍。在ZnO中，HVDs（Sc、Y、La、Ti、Zr、Hf、Ce、V、Nb、Ta）会大幅增加空位形成能，可能使掺杂氧化物成为较差的氧化剂。

这些发现表明，掺杂剂对催化性能的影响取决于宿主氧化物的性质。对于可还原的氧化物如TiO2和CeO2，SVDs和HVDs都可以通过促进氧空位形成来增强氧化催化。然而，对于较难还原的氧化物如ZnO，HVDs可能会抑制氧化催化。

研究还揭示，掺杂氧化物在CO氧化中的催化性能主要由两个因素区分：在表面吸附CO的能力和在氧空位处吸附O2的能力。这两个因素都与空位形成能有关，空位形成能可作为预测催化活性的有用描述符。

由于掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和特定反应机理之间的复杂相互作用，制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则仍然面临挑战。宿主氧化物的可还原性、掺杂剂的价态以及掺杂位点周围的局部电子结构等因素都在决定整体催化性能中起着关键作用。此外，研究表明，在反应机理中考虑自旋守恒规则对于准确预测催化行为可能很重要，这为预测模型的开发增加了另一层复杂性。
