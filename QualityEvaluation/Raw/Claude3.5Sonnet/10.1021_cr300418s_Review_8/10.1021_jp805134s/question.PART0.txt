Abstract
The catalytic properties of CeO2 for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions have implications for a variety of applications. Surface reduction and methane activation are key processes in the overall oxidation reaction, and are examined herein for pure CeO2 (111), (110) and (100) surfaces and surfaces with Zr or Pd substituted in Ce lattice positions. Density functional theory, with the inclusion of an on-site Coulombic interaction (DFT+U), was used to calculate the energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and methane activation. Oxygen vacancy formation is more exothermic for Zr and Pd substituted ceria surfaces than for pure ceria, with Pd-substituted surfaces being significantly more reducible. Methane adsorbs dissociatively as *H and *CH3, and the thermodynamics of dissociative methane adsorption correlate with those of oxygen vacancy formation over the pure and substituted surfaces. The lowest energy pathway for dissociative adsorption on the (111) surface proceeds through H abstraction and the formation of a methyl radical, and subsequent chemisorption of the radical species. Sensitivity of the reported results to the choice of U value within the DFT+U method is discussed.

1 Introduction
Ceria(CeO2) offers unique properties as a heterogeneous catalyst or catalyst support for a number of applications, such as three-way automotive catalysts, (1) preferential CO oxidation, (2) and catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons. (1-10) For each of these applications, the use of ceria is motivated by its ability to store and release oxygen, or more generally to readily transition between oxidation states. Ceria exhibits activity for the oxidation of hydrocarbons, (3-10) making it suitable for catalytic combustion applications and as anode electrocatalysts for direct hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The addition of low levels of rare-earth or noble metals alters the redox properties (11-13) and hydrocarbon oxidation activity (5, 7, 9) of ceria-based materials. The redox properties of ceria-based materials have been probed using experimental (12-21) and theoretical (22-30) methods, however the correlation between redox properties and hydrocarbon oxidation activity with changes in composition is unclear. Herein, we use density functional theory, with the inclusion of an on-site Coulombic interaction (DFT+U), to examine the energetics of dissociative methane adsorption and oxygen vacancy formation over ceria surfaces with the addition of Zr or Pd. These results provide insight into the relationship between composition, surface reduction and catalytic activity of ceria-based materials.
The addition of Zr to CeO2 alters structural and electronic properties of relevance for heterogeneous catalysis, however the impact of Zr addition on surface reducibility and activity is unclear. The substitution of Zr into the ceria lattice to form solid solutions of CeO2ZrO2 results in greater reducibility and thermal stability as compared with pure CeO2. (11, 13, 15, 19, 31, 32) Structural doping of ceria with zirconia results in the substitution of Zr into Ce sites within the CeO2 lattice. (11, 13, 19) Oxidation enthalpies for ceria-zirconia solid solutions (11) obtained by Coulometric and flow titrations were between 200300 kJ·mol1 less than those of pure ceria (for ZrxCe1xO2 where 0.08 < x < 0.86). The presence of Zr increases the mobility of oxygen atoms within the lattice. Ionic conductivity measurements show that the bulk diffusion coefficient of O2 ions is approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher for ceria-zirconia than for pure ceria. (15) Zr doping also increases the stability of ceria when used for the oxidation of hydrocarbons. For the oxidation of CH4 to CO2, microreactor experiments performed by Bozo et. al suggest that Zr doping may increase the thermal stability of ceria by preventing deactivation at high temperatures. While fresh samples of pure CeO2 and Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 resulted in similar fractional conversion of CH4 to CO2, the Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 sample showed over 30% higher conversion than pure CeO2 after aging at 1000 K. (7) The effects of Zr on overall activity and reducibility are therefore well-defined experimentally, motivating the study of surface substitution effects on these properties. Additionally, the known substitution of Zr into Ce positions in the fluorite lattice provides a useful contrast with Pd-substituted systems studied herein.
Palladium supported on ceria has shown promise as an effective catalyst for hydrocarbon oxidation, (33-36) and also displays altered redox properties (37, 38) as compared to pure ceria. Palladium deposited at 2 wt % on CeO2 was observed to achieve 100% conversion for the catalytic combustion of methane at temperatures as low as 300 C, (35) compared to temperatures in excess of 700 C necessary for complete oxidation over pure CeO2. (7) In experiments utilizing ceria-based anode materials for the direct oxidation of hydrocarbons in a solid oxide fuel cell, (9) the addition of 1 wt % Pd to ceria increased the maximum power density nearly 2-fold for the oxidation of H2 and n-butane, and by a factor of almost 10 for the oxidation of methane. For Pd supported on ceria, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results indicate that surface reduction can occur at temperatures as low as 423 K, as compared to 623 K for pure ceria. (37, 38) The mechanism by which Pd alters the catalytic activity and reducibility of ceria is not well understood. Although supported Pd particles may catalyze otherwise limiting bond activation steps, many studies have highlighted that the nature of the metalsupport interaction is fundamental in dictating catalytic activity. (33-35, 37-39) While the reduction properties of the Pd/CeO2 system have been less extensively investigated than those of ZrO2CeO2, unique interactions between Pd and CeO2 at the metalmetal oxide interface have been observed. (34, 36-39) High resolution electron microscopy (HREM) images show evidence of alloying between Pd and Ce species at the Pd/CeO2 interface after reduction at temperatures exceeding 1173 K. (39) Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data, Xiao et al. propose that palladium oxide (PdOx) species may form at the PdCeO2 interface. (35) Experimental studies have demonstrated the effects on catalytic performance and redox properties of the addition of Pd to ceria, however the mechanism responsible for these effects merits further theoretical investigation. Herein, we postulate that Pd atoms may occupy Ce lattice positions at the intact or reduced CeO2 surface and probe the impact of this substitution on surface reducibility and methane activation energetics.
There are a number of DFT-based theoretical studies of ceria available in the literature which have informed the methodological choices made in this study, and provide analysis complementary to that presented. (22, 25, 26, 28-30, 40-46) The DFT+U methodology applied herein for substituted surfaces is similar to that implemented by Nolan et al. to study oxygen vacancy formation in bulk ceria as well as the (111), (110), and (100) surfaces of ceria. (25, 44) The energy of oxygen vacancy formation was found to be more exothermic for ceria surfaces than for bulk ceria. (25, 44) This result is in direct agreement with Coulometric and flow titration results obtained by Zhou et al., which show ceria surface oxidation enthalpies to be up to 200 kJ·mol1 O2 more exothermic than those of the bulk. (47) Nolan et al. also observe the appearance of a gap state between the valence band and unoccupied Ce 4f states upon formation of an oxygen vacancy, consistent with the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. (25, 44) Yang et al. have published DFT+U results for oxygen vacancy formation for bulk ceria with the substitution of both Zr (27) and Pd (26) into Ce sites within the CeO2 lattice. Using a 96-atom supercell to model the bulk fluorite lattice of ceria, one Zr or Pd atom was substituted into a Ce site corresponding to Ce0.97Zr0.03O2 and Ce0.97Pd0.03O2, respectively. For both Ce0.97Zr0.03O2 and Ce0.97Pd0.03O2, the most exothermic oxygen sites for vacancy formation are those coordinated to the substituted metal atom. They report that the oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEvac) is lowered by 0.65 eV next to a Zr atom and by 2.4 eV next to a Pd atom as compared with values calculated for pure ceria. They also conclude based on spin-density, density of states (DOS), and atomic charge results, that oxygen vacancy formation results in the reduction of nearest Ce atoms for Ce0.97Zr0.03O2 and the reduction of the Pd atom for Ce0.97Pd0.03O2. (26, 27) The current study extends a similar approach to the study of surface reducibility and activity for methane activation.
The addition of rare-earth or noble metals to ceria results in both altered redox properties as well as altered catalytic activity. The design of effective ceria-based catalysts motivates our application of electronic structure methods to investigate both reducibility and CH activation energetics and their relationship to each other. The energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption over pure and Zr or Pd substituted ceria (111), (110) and (100) surfaces were determined using the DFT+U method. This theoretical approach allows us to determine key electronic, structural and chemical characteristics of ceria surfaces on the atomic scale, less accessible to experiment. We do not address the preference for Pd or Zr to occupy Ce surface sites, a topic which will be addressed in subsequent studies. Investigation of ceria containing Zr is chosen in large part due to the well established effects of Zr doping on ceria reducibility which allows for qualitative validation of our theoretical approach and results. Pd has been chosen for this study due to the substantial improvements in catalytic performance of Pd/CeO2 materials. This study investigates the effects on redox properties and catalytic activity of Pd incorporation into the CeO2 lattice, a phenomena which has been observed for BaCe1xPdxO3δ. (48) Li et al. report neutron and X-ray diffraction data which confirm the substitution of Pd into the Ce sites in the perovskite structure of BaCe1xPdxO3δ, and show that Pd substitution can be instigated by heating in an oxidizing (O2) atmosphere or reversed by heating in a reducing atmosphere (H2/N2). (48) We report the energies of oxygen vacancy formation for each surface, the preferred adsorption mode and sites for methane adsorption, and the dissociative methane adsorption energy. The barrier for methane activation over the CeO2(111) surface is reported. Each result is discussed in the context of changes in electronic as well as structural features of each surface, and sensitivity of conclusions to the DFT+U method is discussed. These studies provide insight into properties of relevance to the catalytic performance of ceria-based materials, and ultimately will help facilitate future efforts in catalyst development.
2 Methods
Calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Program (VASP), an ab initio total-energy and molecular dynamics program developed at the Institute for Material Physics at the University of Vienna. (49-51) The strongly oscillating wave functions of core electrons are represented using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method. (52) Plane wave basis sets are used to expand the wave functions of valence electrons, with valence configurations for cerium being 5s25p66s24f15d1, for oxygen 2s22p4, for Zr 3d104s2, for Pd 4d10, for C 2s22p2 and for H 1s1. A cutoff energy of 450 eV was used for the plane-wave basis set, and all calculations were spin-polarized. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a (2 × 2 × 2) Monkhorst Pack (MP) grid (53) for bulk ceria, and a (2 × 2 × 1) MP grid for surfaces, with the third vector perpendicular to the surface. The PerdewWang (PW91) version of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is used to incorporate exchange and correlation energies. (54) Structural optimizations were performed by minimizing the forces on all atoms to below 0.05 eV·Å1.
Due to well-established difficulties within DFT to accurately represent the nature of 4f states in ceria, (22-24) we implement the DFT+U approach. (55, 56) Standard DFT representations fail to describe the partial occupation of Ce 4f states associated with the formation of oxygen vacancies and the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. The DFT+U method introduces the Hubbard U-term as an on-site Coulombic interaction in the f states of ceria, which allows electrons to localize in these states. When electrons localize on cerium atoms, a gap state appears between the occupied valence band and the remaining unoccupied states representing the unpaired, localized Ce 4f occupation. The energy between this gap state and the valence band is influenced by the value of the U parameter. We use a value of U = 5 eV for the majority of calculations presented herein, which is consistent with recommended values within this method used in previous DFT studies of ceria. (25-27, 30, 44, 45, 55-57) The reported energy differences for vacancy formation and methane adsorption differ based on the choice of U value, and therefore the sensitivity of reported values to the choice of the U parameter is discussed in Section 3.4.
Harmonic vibrational modes have been calculated to determine zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) corrections to adsorption energies and reaction barriers. Constrained vibrational calculations have been done for surface systems with adsorbates, where the Hessian matrix is populated solely with second derivatives of energy with respect to position of the adsorbate atoms. This approximation is sufficient to capture large energy differences associated with the breaking of CH bonds and the forming of OH and OC bonds. The climbing image nudged elastic band method (CI-NEB) (58-60) was used to isolate transition states, and thus determine reaction barriers for methane adsorption. Within the CI-NEB method, a sequence of images along the reaction path are optimized with the highest energy image required to climb up in energy along the elastic band to estimate the saddle point along the minimum energy path. (60) Four equally spaced images between reactant and product states were used in each search, and transition states were identified as the maximum energy image with an absolute tangential force of less than 0.04 eV·Å1. Atomic charge data has been obtained by the Bader atoms-in-molecules method in which individual atoms are divided by zero-flux surfaces which are defined as 2-D planes in which the gradient of charge density is zero perpendicular to the plane. (61-63)
Ceria has a cubic fluorite bulk structure, with four cerium and eight oxygen atoms per unit cell. Figure 1a shows the bulk fluorite unit cell of ceria. The optimized equilibrium lattice parameter is 5.466 Å, which is within 1% of the reported experimental value of 5.411 Å. (64) To examine the effects of Zr and Pd in bulk ceria, one cerium atom was substituted for either a Zr or Pd atom, creating a dopant concentration of 3.1%.

To model the ceria (111), (110) and (100) surfaces, slab models were constructed, with each slab separated by 15 Å of vacuum in the direction perpendicular to the surface. Mirrored slabs of 12 atomic layers (Ce16O32) for the (111), 7 atomic layers (Ce14O28) for the (110), and 9 atomic layers (Ce8O16) for the (100) were chosen to model the CeO2 surface, with slab sizes chosen to converge surface energy and vacancy formation energy with respect to slab thickness. Figure 1 displays each mirrored surface slab of ceria used in our calculations. We use a p(2 × 2) expansion of the surface unit cell for (111) and (100), and a p(2 × 1) expansion for (110). For each surface, this expansion results in a termination of four surface oxygen atoms on each side of the slab per unit cell. To maintain the CeO2 stoichiometry of the (100) unit cell, half of the oxygen atoms on each side (2 per side) of the slab were removed, as similarly addressed in previous DFT work done on ceria (100). (25, 44) Mirrored slabs were used specifically to examine oxygen vacancy formation in order to minimize slab to slab interactions which result from a large net surface dipole moment upon formation of a surface oxygen vacancy. Energies of gas-phase molecules were obtained by optimizing free O2, CH4, •CH3 molecules within a 15 Å × 15 Å × 15 Å unit cell.
To calculate the energy of surface vacancy formation an oxygen atom was removed from both sides of each slab, and all slab layers were allowed to relax. We calculated the energy of oxygen vacancy formation from the following formula:
(1)
where ECenO2n2 is the energy of the defective unit cell, EO2 is the energy of a gas-phase O2 molecule, EnCeO2 is the energy of the intact unit cell, and division by two accounts for the mirrored surface. To calculate bulk vacancy formation energies, a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell (Ce32O64) was used and one oxygen atom was removed to create a vacancy concentration of 1.6%. The vacancy formation energies reported in this study are not direct analogs to experimental reduction enthalpies, with key differences, as highlighted by Wang et al., (65) including DFT errors associated with overestimation of the O2 binding energy and incorrect electronic representation of metal reduced states. The DFT+U method is employed herein as a correction to the electronic structure of reduced ceria, and thus the reported values of ΔEvac can be expected to provide consistent qualitative results. Correction of the DFT calculated O2 binding energy may be necessary for direct quantitative agreement with experiment, however will not affect relative values of ΔEvac.
We calculated the energy of dissociative methane adsorption from the following formula:
(2)
where E2(*CH3+*H) is the energy of a given surface slab with adsorbed H and CH3 fragments, Esurf is the energy of the clean surface, and ECH4 is the energy of a gas-phase CH4 molecule. Methane fragments were allowed to adsorb on both sides of the mirrored slab.
To evaluate the reaction energy barrier for CH4  *CH3 + *H, a nonmirrored slab of 6 atomic layers was used to model the (111) surface, due to difficulties in implementing the CI-NEB method for a mirrored reaction. Methane fragments were allowed to adsorb on the top of the slab, and the top half of ions in the surface slab were allowed to relax while the bottom half were fixed at their bulk positions. To validate that slab to slab dipole interactions do not alter the energetics, adsorption energies for H and CH3 on the nonmirrored surface slab was compared with values obtained for the mirrored (111) slab. The dissociative adsorption energy (ΔEads) for methane differed between mirrored and nonmirrored slabs by no more than 0.03 eV for pure and substituted (111) surfaces.
The impact of Zr or Pd substitution on surface reducibility and methane dissociation was investigated by replacing a single Ce atom in the (111), (110) and (100) surfaces. Figure 2 shows top and side views of each surface, with the M1 position corresponding to the dopant site. The surface cell dimensions were not allowed to relax, thus neglecting changes in lattice parameter due to the presence of Zr or Pd. Oxygen vacancy formation energies were calculated for these systems by removing surface oxygen atoms of closest proximity to the substituted metal atoms.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Oxygen Vacancy Formation
Oxygen vacancy formation was considered for both bulk and surface CeO2, and Zr or Pd substituted CeO2. Bulk results are summarized first to illustrate agreement with previous experimental and computational studies.
Substitution of Zr into the bulk ceria lattice results in a slight distortion of the local metal coordination environment, where ZrO distances are 0.07 Å shorter than CeO distances for bulk pure ceria. The calculated bulk vacancy formation energy for Ce0.97Zr0.03O2 is 2.96 eV, which is 0.9 eV lower than that for the same vacancy concentration in pure ceria (3.86 eV). This difference is qualitatively similar to that found by Yang et al., (27) who reported the vacancy formation energy to be 0.6 eV lower for Ce0.97Zr0.03O2 than for pure ceria, using a U value of 6 eV. The oxidation enthalpy of Ce0.81Zr0.19O2 was experimentally determined to be 506 kJ·mol1 O2, (11) which is in reasonable agreement with the calculated value of 2.96 eV per vacancy (570 kJ·mol1 O2) for Ce0.97Zr0.03O2, though as mentioned above, direct comparison with experimental enthalpies is challenged by methodological difficulties. The Bader charge of two Ce atoms next to the vacancy increases by 0.250.3 e, indicative of cerium reduction due to vacancy formation. An occupied electronic state emerges in the DOS data (not shown) between the top of the occupied valence band and the bottom of the unoccupied band following vacancy formation. Projected density of states (PDOS) data shows the presence of this gap state on both of the cerium atoms for which the Bader charge increased. These results are in agreement with previous DFT results, (25, 44) as well as consistent with EELS (66) and XPS (67, 68) data which attribute the presence of this gap state to the formation of Ce3+. Yang et al. also conclude that Ce atoms are reduced rather than Zr atoms in Ce0.97Zr0.03O2x based on DOS data and Bader analysis. (27)
Substitution of Pd into the bulk ceria lattice results in a slight distortion of the local coordination environment, where PdO distances are 0.06 Å shorter than CeO distances for bulk pure ceria. The bulk vacancy formation energy for Ce0.97Pd0.03O2 is 0.67 eV, which is 3.19 eV lower than that for pure ceria (3.86 eV). This result is qualitatively similar to that found by Yang et al., (27) who reported a similar vacancy formation energy change due to the addition of Pd to the bulk CeO2 lattice. We determine a charge increase of 0.37 e for the Pd atom next to the vacancy, with no significant reduction of adjacent Ce atoms (<0.05 e). DOS analysis shows the presence of an occupied gap state between the valence and unoccupied bands, however this gap state has no net spin and PDOS data reveals that the gap state represents a newly occupied Pd state. Yang et al. also found evidence of Pd reduction rather than reduction of Ce, based on spin-density analysis and DOS data. (26)
Figure 2ac shows the top view of each surface, and the surface metal atoms as well as specific near-surface atoms are labeled for reference. Surface oxygen atoms of the (111) surface are coordinated to three subsurface metal atoms and there are four total surface oxygen atoms in each p(2 × 2) unit cell. For the (110) surface, surface oxygen atoms are coordinated to two surface metal atoms in the same plane and one subsurface metal atom, with a total of four surface oxygen atoms in each p(2 × 1) unit cell. Each surface oxygen atom of the (100) surface is coordinated to two subsurface metal atoms, with two surface oxygen atoms in each cell.
The oxygen vacancy formation energies for each surface and composition are shown in Table 1. For pure ceria, the values for vacancy formation energy are in agreement with similar calculations by Nolan et al. (25, 44) Bader charges (shown in Table 1) for each metal atom labeled in Figure 1 show a net charge increase in the range of 0.320.37 e for two of the cerium atoms next to each surface oxygen vacancy. The formation of a surface oxygen vacancy, therefore, results in the reduction of two adjacent cerium atoms. Figure 3 shows the density of states for the pure ceria (111) surface, with a plot for the intact surface, the surface with an oxygen vacancy, and the surface with CH3 and H adsorbates. For the vacant (111) surface, a gap state similar to that for vacant bulk ceria is attributed to the reduced Ce3+ states. This gap state is observed in the DOS for each pure ceria surface termination (not shown).

Zr substitution into the (111), (110), and (100) surfaces of ceria results in similar distortion of the coordination environment as bulk substitution, including shorter metaloxygen bonds around the Zr atom. Bader charges indicate that adjacent cerium atoms are reduced by 0.260.32 e during the formation of an oxygen vacancy, while Zr atoms show no significant reduction (<0.08 e). DOS analysis (not shown) yields a similar result for pure ceria, showing the presence of a gap state for each vacant surface tied to the formation of Ce3+. The vacancy formation energy for Zr substituted ceria surfaces is 0.421.13 eV lower (dependent on surface termination) than for pure ceria, compared to a reduction of 0.9 eV in the vacancy formation energy for Zr substituted bulk CeO2. The differences between bulk and surface vacancy formation energies for Zr substituted ceria indicate that the effects of Zr substitution on surface reducibility are dependent on surface structure. The thermodynamic preference of Zr to segregate to the surface versus bulk at these (low) dopant levels was not directly considered, however the range of vacancy formation energies spanning the bulk value suggests that segregation preferences for each surface termination are a function of atmospheric conditions. The substitution of Zr into the (111) surface decreases the energy of oxygen vacancy formation more (1.13 eV) with respect to pure ceria than does Zr substitution into the bulk (0.9 eV). Thus in a reducing environment, Zr may prefer to segregate to the (111) surface, whereas in an oxidizing environment Zr may prefer to remain in the bulk.
Pd substitution into the (111) surface of ceria results in notable distortions of the surface structure as compared to pure ceria, especially when an oxygen vacancy is formed. Figure 4 shows the optimized structure for each fully oxidized and oxygen vacant structure containing a Pd atom, with each oxygen atom which was removed to form a vacancy labeled. For the (111) surface, Pd substitution results in contraction of the lattice around the Pd center to form PdO coordination lengths 0.10.2 Å shorter than CeO lengths in the first three surface layers. Following vacancy formation, the distance between the Pd atom and subsurface O atom becomes 0.38 Å greater (2.74 Å) than the analogous CeO distance, allowing Pd to assume what resembles a square planar ligand coordination with four PdO distances of 2.102.20 Å (see Figure 4d) following vacancy formation. This type of configuration is consistent with the coordination environment for Pd2+ in PdO2. The vacancy formation energy for the (111) surface containing a Pd atom is 2.05 eV lower (0.71 eV) than for pure ceria (111). Bader charges (Table 1), indicate that Pd is reduced by 0.43 e upon formation of a vacancy, and DOS data confirm the presence of newly occupied Pd gap states similar to oxygen vacant bulk Ce0.97Pd0.03O2. As shown in Figure 3d, these newly occupied Pd states appear as a gap state with no net spin between the valence and unoccupied bands. This suggests that the formation of an oxygen vacancy in the presence of Pd on the (111) surface of ceria results in reduction of the Pd atom, and no change in the oxidation state of Ce atoms.

For the (110) and (100) surfaces, similar contraction around the Pd center is seen to that in the bulk however no surface specific distortions are observed for intact surfaces. The formation of an oxygen vacancy in the (110) surface results in significant lengthening of a remaining PdO interatomic distance from 2.17 Å previous to vacancy formation to 3.20 Å after vacancy formation. The Pd atom maintains the rest of its original coordination environment, resulting in four nearest neighbor oxygen at distances 2.16 Å. A vacancy in the (100) surface does not result in any significant distortions, yet similar to the (111) and (110) surfaces leaves the Pd atom in a four coordinate environment. The vacancy formation energies for the (110) and (100) Pd substituted surfaces are 2.19 and 2.29 eV lower than for pure ceria, respectively. For both of these surfaces, the vacancy formation energy is exothermic, indicating that reduction is favorable thermodynamically even without the inclusion of entropic terms. Bader charges and DOS data confirm that for both (110) and (100) surfaces of ceria, oxygen vacancy formation in the presence of Pd results in the reduction of the Pd atom.
A number of conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of surface vacancy formation. For pure ceria, oxygen vacancy formation is most exothermic for the (110) surface, followed by the (100) and then the (111) surface. Vacancy formation on these systems results in the reduction of two surface cerium atoms per vacancy. For Zr-doped surfaces, vacancy formation energies proceed in the following order: (100) > (111) > (110). The change in order can be attributed to the specific coordination environment of the (100) surface when Zr is substituted into the surface. The (100) surface becomes the most endothermic to reduce because the surface oxygen atoms are only coordinated with two metal atoms, one of which is Zr, which is not reduced upon formation of a vacancy. Thus, a subsurface Ce atom with a full oxygen coordination environment is reduced, which is less favorable than reducing a Ce atom adjacent to the vacancy. For Pd-doped surfaces, vacancy formation energies assume the same order as for pure ceria, with the (110) having the most exothermic ΔEvac. In each case, Pd is reduced instead of Ce, as visible in Bader charge and DOS data.
The energetics of further reduction of each (111) and (110) surface was considered by calculating the energy of forming a second oxygen vacancy per surface cell. For the Pd-substituted (110) surface, the surface oxygen atom which extends away from the Pd atom (labeled in Figure 4d) as a result of the first vacancy was removed to form the second vacancy. For Pd-substituted (111) as well as Zr-substituted (111) and (110), one of the equivalent remaining nearest neighbor surface oxygen to the dopant metal was removed to form the second oxygen vacancy. For pure ceria (111) and (110), remaining surface oxygen in the vacant surface are equivalent and thus a surface oxygen was removed to form a second vacancy. For Pd-substituted surfaces, the removal of a second surface oxygen results in further reduction of the Pd atom. For pure CeO2 and Zr-substituted CeO2 (111) and (110), previously unreduced cerium atoms become reduced due to second vacancy formation. Second vacancy formation energies for each surface are listed in Table 1 as ΔEvac. For each system, the formation of a second oxygen vacancy per surface is more endothermic than the formation of the first vacancy.
3.2 Thermodynamics of Dissociative Methane Adsorption
The dissociative adsorption of methane to the pure and Zr or Pd substituted CeO2 surfaces was studied using the DFT+U method. We found no notable interaction (>0.05 eV) between the intact CH4 molecule and the clean (111), (110) and (100) surfaces. The lack of an exothermic molecularly adsorbed state is consistent with the approach of a nonpolar adsorbate to the ceria surface and with the difficulty of DFT to represent long-range dispersion interactions. (69) Methane dissociatively adsorbs exothermically as CH3 and H fragments, with each fragment binding to different surface oxygen atoms as shown in Figure 2. Attempts to optimize adsorption configurations involving adsorbate interaction with surface cerium atoms were unsuccessful. For the (111) surface of pure ceria, OH and OC bonds align perpendicular to the surface giving each oxygen atom a tetrahedral coordination. CeO distances lengthen by 0.100.25 Å for those oxygen bound to H or CH3 species. The (110) surface of pure ceria displays similar CeO lengthening, with the most dramatic change seen in the distance between surface oxygen and subsurface cerium atoms (0.601.20 Å). For the ceria (100) surface, CH3 and H fragments also adsorb atop surface oxygen atoms, creating a trigonal coordination environment about O and lengthening the CeO distance by 0.30 Å.
Methane adsorption is a surface reduction process similar to that of vacancy formation, which suggests that surface reducibility and alkane adsorption thermodynamics are directly correlated. Bader charge analysis for each of the pure ceria surfaces reveals partial reduction of surface and subsurface ceria similar to that caused by oxygen vacancy formation. For two of the cerium atoms coordinated with oxygen atoms serving as adsorption sites, there is a 0.220.26 e increase in Bader charge following adsorption of CH3 and H. The DOS for each surface with CH3 and H adsorbed (shown for the (111) in Figure 3c), exhibits a similar gap state to that described earlier for vacancy formation. Thus, methane adsorption (CH4  *CH3 + *H) over CeO2 (111), (110), and (100) surfaces results in the reduction of surface cerium atoms similar to that of vacancy formation.
The preferred adsorption configuration on Zr-substituted surfaces is consistent with pure ceria surfaces, with CH3 and H both adsorbing on surface oxygen atoms. Adsorption is preferred with CH3 and H adsorbed to surface oxygen atoms also coordinated with the Zr. Equilibrium structures could not be located with adsorbates bound to surface Ce or Zr atoms. Table 2 lists methane adsorption energies and the resulting changes in Bader charge for each surface. The adsorption energy was 0.150.38 eV more exothermic, depending on surface termination, for surfaces containing Zr versus those of pure ceria. Bader charge analysis illustrates that adsorption resulted in the reduction of surface and/or subsurface cerium atoms by 0.220.30 e, with minimal charge differences for Zr (<0.05 e). DOS data confirms the presence of newly occupied Ce states as a result of adsorption, consistent with the reduction of cerium atoms similarly to vacancy formation. This result is similar to that for vacancy formation in Zr containing surfaces, as in both cases the reduction process (whether it be vacancy formation or adsorption) results in the reduction of Ce atoms but not Zr atoms.

Adsorption on surfaces containing Pd was most exothermic with CH3 and H binding to surface oxygen coordinated with Pd. As with Zr incorporated and pure CeO2 surfaces, equilibrium structures could not be located with CH3 or H species bound to Ce or Pd atoms. Adsorption energies were more exothermic than those found for pure CeO2 by 0.531.28 eV (Table 2). Bader charges indicate that Pd is reduced in these systems by 0.320.43 e with little change in Ce charge (<0.08 e), and DOS analysis confirms the reduction of Pd as a result of adsorption. Thus, the reduction caused by the dissociative adsorption of methane results in only reduction of the Pd atom, similar to that for vacancy formation. Adsorption is substantially more exothermic than over pure ceria due to the greater reducibility of the Pd-containing surfaces, despite no direct bonding of CH3 or H species with Pd atoms.
3.3 Methane Adsorption on Prereduced Surfaces
Dissociative adsorption of methane was investigated on CeO2 (111) and (110) surfaces with oxygen vacancies. Adsorption to vacant (100) surfaces was not studied due to the lack of two surface oxygen atoms in the vacant p(2 × 2) cell, and the excessive computational requirements of using larger supercells to model the (100) surface. For the vacant CeO2 (111) and (110) surfaces, adsorption preferentially occurs for CH3 and H on surface oxygen sites identical to those for intact surfaces. The adsorption energies for vacant surfaces (Eads) are given in Table 2. Adsorption is less exothermic on the vacant surfaces as compared to the fully oxidized surfaces by 0.17 eV (0.59 eV) and 1.27 eV (0.05 eV) on the (111) and (110) surfaces, respectively, due to the prereduced nature of the vacant surface. Adsorption on both surfaces results in reduction of surface and/or subsurface Ce4+ ions which were previously unreduced by vacancy formation, confirmed by Bader charges and PDOS. The dramatic increase in adsorption energy for the vacant (110) surface is likely due to the required reduction of two subsurface Ce atoms, whereas adsorption on the defective (111) surface results in only reduction of Ce atoms in the surface layer.
The dissociative adsorption of methane was also considered on vacant, Zr or Pd substituted surfaces. In each case, adsorption was less exothermic than for intact surfaces due to the prereduced nature of surface metal atoms. For the vacant Zr-substituted CeO2 (111) and (110) surfaces, the adsorption energy is 0.18 (0.82 eV) and 1.32 eV (0.28 eV) less exothermic, respectively. Adsorption on vacant Pd-substituted (111) and (110) is less exothermic by 0.41 (1.52 eV) and 0.68 eV (1.82 eV), respectively. As vacancy formation opens coordination sites on Zr and Pd atoms, direct bonding of CH3 and H species to metal atoms was considered for vacant surfaces. As with pure ceria surfaces, equilibrium structures could not be located with CH3 or H fragments bound directly to Zr or Pd, and adsorption occurred preferentially on remaining oxygen atoms. Adsorption of CH3 and H to surface oxygen atoms of vacant Zr-substituted CeO2 surfaces results in the reduction of two additional Ce atoms. Adsorption to the vacant, Pd-substituted CeO2 surface results in further reduction of the Pd atom. Thus, dissociative methane adsorption is a surface reduction process, and is less exothermic on surfaces which are prereduced due to the formation of oxygen vacancies.
3.4 Dependence of ΔEvac and ΔEads on Value of Hubbard U-term
The proper choice of U value is not well defined, as the value of 5 eV used thus far is based on proper representation of the band gap in Ce2O3, and is not certain to represent vacancy formation energetics. Pacchioni et al. (70) highlighted that the differences between vacancy formation energies for CeO2 determined by various computational methods may be as high as 3 eV, including methods which inaccurately describe the electronic structure of the reduced state. In this study, we have concentrated on implementing the DFT+U method to accurately describe the electronic structure of reduced ceria, and obtain consistent qualitative results. As discussed by Pacchioni et al., without a direct experimental benchmark, it is not possible to conclusively determine if the choice of U value reproduces the experimental vacancy formation energy. Therefore, the sensitivity of ΔEvac and ΔEads to the U value was determined to provide context for the results presented within the DFT+U method herein and to further justify a U value of 5 eV. The energies of oxygen vacancy formation and dissociative methane adsorption on the (111) surface were calculated for values of U between 0 and 8. Figure 5 shows ΔEvac and ΔEads plotted versus U value for pure ceria, Zr-substituted and Pd-substituted (111) surfaces. For pure and Zr-substituted ceria, the vacancy formation energy and adsorption energy increase in exothermicity linearly with increasing U value above 3 eV. For Pd-substituted ceria, the vacancy formation energy and adsorption energy linearly become less exothermic with increasing U value, however the values are considerably less dependent on the U value. Vacancy formation and adsorption on pure or Zr-substituted ceria reduces surface Ce atoms by Ce 4f occupation, leading to strong dependence of ΔEads and ΔEvac on the value of U. For the Pd-substituted ceria, vacancy formation and adsorption reduce surface Pd atoms instead of Ce, and thus the lack of occupied Ce 4f states leads to little influence of U value on energetics.

The influence of the U value on the energy of the Ce 4f states can be shown by considering the relative energy of the gap state (resulting from partial occupation of Ce 4f states due to reduction), with respect to the CeO2 valence band (ΔEgap). The energy difference between the CeO2 valence band and the 4f gap state, ΔEgap, is illustrated in Figure 3 and included for different U values in Table 3. The value of ΔEgap is strongly dependent on the U value for pure and Zr-substituted ceria, but shows only slight dependence on the U value for Pd-substituted ceria. For pure ceria, ΔEgap decreases with increasing U, and at U = 7 eV no gap state peak is visible in the density of states, which can be attributed to an overlap in energy between the gap state and the CeO2 valence band. At U = 3 eV, the gap state peak also cannot be identified, due to delocalization of f electrons into the Ce 4f band. Similar to the pure ceria case, vanishing of a distinct gap state for Zr-substituted ceria is observed at U values of 4 and 7 eV. A U value of 5 eV results in a distinct gap state due to the localization of Ce 4f electrons, and lies between the 4 and 7 eV limits, thus further motivating its use in this study.

3.5 Correlation between Vacancy Formation and Methane Adsorption
Oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption are both reduction processes on ceria, specifically causing the reduction of surface metal atoms. Thus, since both processes result in similar changes in the electronic structure of the ceria surface, correlation between the vacancy formation energy and methane adsorption energy is expected. Figure 7 shows the dissociative adsorption energy of methane plotted versus vacancy formation energy for each surface investigated. Adsorption energies to intact surfaces are plotted versus first vacancy formation energies, whereas adsorption energies to prereduced, vacant surfaces are plotted versus second vacancy formation energies. This plot illustrates correlation between the vacancy formation energy and adsorption energy across surface composition, though scatter is introduced due to differences in surface termination. Surfaces containing Pd atoms exhibit the most exothermic vacancy formation energies as well as adsorption energies, followed by surfaces with Zr and finally those for pure ceria. Perfect linear correlation between vacancy formation and methane adsorption energies is complicated by variations in MO bond energies in the intact and reduced states, and significant distortions of the surface structure for surfaces with two oxygen vacancies per unit cell. The general trend between the energetics of vacancy formation and methane adsorption, however, suggests that the energy of methane adsorption on ceria surfaces is dependent on surface reducibility.

3.6 Activation Barrier for Dissociative Methane Adsorption
The lowest energy reaction barrier for methane adsorption over CeO2 surfaces, regardless of termination, occurs through the abstraction of H from CH4. The highest energy state along this reaction path consists of an adsorbed (abstracted) H atom and a methyl radical. The initial, transition and final states for this process over CeO2 (111) are shown in Figure 4. At the highest energy state along the reaction path, as located by the CI-NEB search method, the OH bond is formed, the CH bond elongated to >2.5 Å, and there is no indication of interaction between the methyl C atom and the O atom to which it is bound in the final *CH3 state. Bader charge analysis is consistent with the highest energy state representing a •CH3 radical and a singly reduced, H* adsorbed surface. Comparison of the total energy of this highest energy state with the sum of H* adsorbed and isolated •CH3 fragments confirms the lack of interaction between the •CH3 fragment and the surface. This highest energy state does not have an imaginary vibrational frequency but instead is a local minimum along the potential energy surface. Attempts to use the CI-NEB method to locate a higher energy state between this minima and either the initial or final state indicated a monotonic increase in energy toward this state.
The energy barrier for dissociative methane adsorption proceeding through a methyl radical state is listed for each (111) surface in Table 4, along with changes in surface metal Bader charge for the radical state with respect to the clean (111) surface. The methane activation barrier, given as the relative energy of the radical state (Erad), decreases for Zr-substituted ceria with respect to pure ceria, and even further for Pd-substituted ceria. Pd incorporation thus leads to stronger adsorption and a lower energy barrier for dissociative adsorption, without direct involvement of Pd coordination sites. Based on the trends presented herein of the reduction energetics of pure, Zr-substituted and Pd-substituted ceria, the relationship between Erad and composition is consistent with the expected trend for a 1 e reduction.

In considering a number of possible methane activation paths over Mo3O9 clusters, Fu et al. (71) reported the H abstraction path to have the lowest barrier. Cheng et al. reported H abstraction with the formation of an isopropyl radical as the lowest energy path for propane dehydrogenation over V4O10 clusters. (72) The preference of this path over these flexible cluster structures, with the availability of bridging and terminal O atoms as well as a flexible coordination environment about the metal center, suggest that our findings over the more rigid CeO2 surface are reasonable. Multiple attempts to identify a concerted reaction path involving CO bond formation along with CH dissociation were unsuccessful. Analysis of the potential energy surface for methane activation over CeO2 and doped CeO2 surfaces is a subject of continuing investigation. Due to the inability of the CI-NEB method to identify a true transition state, the activation barrier for methane adsorption will be investigated in more detail in future studies.
4 Conclusions
The DFT+U method was used to show that both oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption on ceria and doped ceria are surface reduction processes, and thus the reaction energy for methane oxidation correlates with surface reducibility. Dissociative methane adsorption proceeds through H abstraction and the formation of a methyl radical transition state in which a metal atom of the surface is reduced by a single electron. The activation barrier for this step, therefore, also correlates with the surface reducibility measured by the oxygen vacancy formation energy. The incorporation of metals such as Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption. Previous studies (13, 19-21) have illustrated the incorporation of Zr into the fluorite lattice of ceria, however we have neglected to consider the thermodynamic preference of Pd surface substitution, which will be addressed in future studies.
This study illustrates the correlation between surface reducibility and catalytic activity for methane oxidation on CeO2-based materials. Calculated reaction energies suggest that a fully oxidized surface will provide enhanced activity for methane activation. The reducibility can be increased by the substitution of Zr or Pd into the CeO2 surface, which also lowers the energy barrier for dissociative methane adsorption.
