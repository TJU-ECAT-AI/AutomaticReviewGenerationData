How do same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, and what insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications? Additionally, what challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)?

The given scientific literature does not contain information specifically addressing the effects of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. The text focuses on the effects of tetravalent dopants on ceria (CeO2), particularly examining vacancy formation energies, redox properties, and oxygen storage capacity. It does not discuss SVDs vs HVDs or provide insights into their effects on various catalytic applications across different metal oxides. Additionally, the document does not address challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior considering factors like Lewis acid-base interactions or the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible). The content is primarily centered on computational studies of specific tetravalent dopants in ceria and does not provide the broader perspective on dopant behavior in various metal oxides that the question is seeking.

给定的科学文献并不包含特别针对同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对不同金属氧化物催化性能影响的信息。该文本主要关注四价掺杂剂对氧化铈(CeO2)的影响,特别是研究了空位形成能、氧化还原性质和氧储存能力。它没有讨论SVDs与HVDs的比较,也没有提供它们在各种催化应用中对不同金属氧化物影响的见解。此外,该文件没有涉及制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战,如考虑路易斯酸碱相互作用或宿主氧化物的性质(可还原vs不可还原)等因素。内容主要集中在氧化铈中特定四价掺杂剂的计算研究,没有提供问题所寻求的关于各种金属氧化物中掺杂剂行为的更广泛视角。

The given scientific literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering the question about same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influencing catalytic properties of metal oxides. The document focuses on theoretical studies of CeO2 doped with tetravalent ions, particularly examining redox thermodynamics and structural properties. It does not discuss catalytic applications or compare SVDs and HVDs. The paper is limited to computational investigations of specific tetravalent dopants in ceria and does not provide broader insights into formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior across different metal oxide systems.

The given scientific literature does not contain information specifically addressing the effects of same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) on the catalytic properties of different metal oxides. The document focuses on the theoretical study of CeO2 doped with tetravalent ions, particularly from groups 4a and 4b of the periodic table. It does not discuss catalytic applications or provide insights into formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior considering factors like Lewis acid-base interactions or the nature of the host oxide.

The literature primarily examines how small amounts of dissolved SiO2, GeO2, SnO2, or PbO2 affect the redox thermodynamics of ceria (CeO2). It discusses vacancy formation energies, migration barriers, and solution energies of these dopants in ceria. While this information is relevant to understanding the properties of doped ceria, it does not directly address the broader question about SVDs and HVDs in various metal oxides or their effects on catalytic performance.

Without specific information from the given text, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the question about the influence of SVDs and HVDs on catalytic properties of different metal oxides or the challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior.

给定的科学文献不包含特别关于同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对不同金属氧化物催化性能影响的信息。该文档主要集中于理论研究四价离子（特别是来自周期表4a和4b族的元素）掺杂的CeO2。它没有讨论催化应用，也没有提供关于制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的见解，如考虑Lewis酸碱相互作用或宿主氧化物的性质等因素。

这篇文献主要研究少量溶解的SiO2、GeO2、SnO2或PbO2如何影响氧化铈（CeO2）的氧化还原热力学。它讨论了这些掺杂剂在氧化铈中的空位形成能、迁移势垒和溶解能。虽然这些信息与理解掺杂氧化铈的性质相关，但它并没有直接回答关于SVDs和HVDs在各种金属氧化物中的作用或它们对催化性能影响的更广泛问题。

由于给定文本中没有具体信息，无法就SVDs和HVDs对不同金属氧化物催化性能的影响或制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战提供全面的答案。
