The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) or their influence on different metal oxides. The document focuses on the effects of Cu, Mg, and Zn doping on La2O3 for methane activation, but does not discuss SVDs and HVDs in general or their broader impacts on catalytic properties. The literature also does not cover challenges in formulating predictive rules for dopant behavior or factors like Lewis acid-base interactions. As such, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given text.

给定的文献并不包含特别涉及同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)或它们对不同金属氧化物的影响的信息。该文档主要关注Cu、Mg和Zn掺杂对La2O3甲烷活化的影响,但并未讨论SVDs和HVDs的普遍性或它们对催化性能的更广泛影响。文献也没有涵盖制定掺杂剂行为预测规则的挑战,或诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用等因素。因此,仅基于给定文本中提供的信息,无法充分回答这个问题。
