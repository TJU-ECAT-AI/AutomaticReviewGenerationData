[1] "We found that the low-valence dopants (LVDs) lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation near them or far from them. This is true when they dope a reducible (CeO2) or an irreducible (MgO) oxide."

[2] "In irreducible oxides, high-valence dopants seem to always increase the energy of vacancy formation. This increase is small in very stable oxides (MgO and La2O3) and substantial in less-stable oxide (e.g., ZnO)."

[3] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopant–oxygen bonds that are much shorter than the Ce–O bonds in ceria."

[4] "We speculate that this is one the reasons for the similarity of their effect on ΔEv. The other reason is that their bonds with oxygen, in their own oxides, is much shorter than the Ce–O bond in CeO2. When one of these dopants replaces a Ce atom, it pulls the oxygen atoms in the oxide surface toward it and away from cerium. By doing this, they weaken the bond of the oxygen to the surface."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides in different ways, depending on the nature of the host oxide:

1. In irreducible oxides like MgO:
- Low-valence dopants (LVDs) lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation both near and far from the dopant site.
- High-valence dopants (HVDs) generally increase the energy of vacancy formation. This increase is small in very stable oxides like MgO and La2O3, but more substantial in less stable oxides like ZnO.

2. In reducible oxides like CeO2:
- LVDs also lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation both near and far from the dopant site.
- The behavior of HVDs and same-valence dopants (SVDs) is more complex and less predictable. For example, dopants like Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, and W all lower the energy of vacancy formation by similar amounts in CeO2, despite having different valences and very different chemical properties.

Computational studies have provided insights into the mechanisms behind these effects:
- LVDs create holes in the valence band, which can be filled by electrons left behind when oxygen vacancies are formed, lowering the overall energy.
- In CeO2, some HVDs (like W and Mo) donate electrons to reduce Ce atoms, effectively becoming tetravalent like the Ce they replace.
- Many dopants in CeO2 form shorter bonds with oxygen than Ce does, pulling oxygen atoms away from Ce and weakening their bond to the surface.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:
- The complex interplay between electronic effects (e.g., electron donation, hole creation) and structural effects (e.g., bond length changes).
- The different behaviors observed in reducible vs. irreducible oxides.
- The unexpected similarities in effects between dopants with very different chemical properties.
- The need to consider both local and long-range effects of dopants.

These findings highlight the importance of considering the specific host oxide and dopant combination when predicting catalytic behavior, rather than relying solely on general rules based on valence or chemical properties.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物的催化性能的影响方式不同，这取决于宿主氧化物的性质：

1. 在不可还原的氧化物（如MgO）中：
- 低价掺杂剂（LVDs）降低了氧空位形成的能量，无论是在掺杂剂附近还是远离掺杂剂的位置。
- 高价掺杂剂（HVDs）通常增加空位形成的能量。这种增加在非常稳定的氧化物（如MgO和La2O3）中很小，但在较不稳定的氧化物（如ZnO）中更显著。

2. 在可还原的氧化物（如CeO2）中：
- LVDs也降低了氧空位形成的能量，无论是在掺杂剂附近还是远离掺杂剂的位置。
- HVDs和同价掺杂剂（SVDs）的行为更为复杂和难以预测。例如，Pt、Ru、Zr、Ta、Nb、Mo和W等掺杂剂在CeO2中都以相似的程度降低了空位形成的能量，尽管它们具有不同的价态和非常不同的化学性质。

计算研究为这些效应的机制提供了见解：
- LVDs在价带中创造空穴，当形成氧空位时留下的电子可以填充这些空穴，从而降低总体能量。
- 在CeO2中，一些HVDs（如W和Mo）捐赠电子以还原Ce原子，有效地变成与它们替代的Ce相同的四价态。
- 许多掺杂剂在CeO2中与氧形成比Ce更短的键，将氧原子拉离Ce并削弱它们与表面的键合。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的挑战包括：
- 电子效应（如电子捐赠、空穴创造）和结构效应（如键长变化）之间的复杂相互作用。
- 在可还原和不可还原氧化物中观察到的不同行为。
- 化学性质非常不同的掺杂剂之间效应的意外相似性。
- 需要考虑掺杂剂的局部和长程效应。

这些发现强调了在预测催化行为时考虑特定宿主氧化物和掺杂剂组合的重要性，而不是仅仅依赖基于价态或化学性质的一般规则。
