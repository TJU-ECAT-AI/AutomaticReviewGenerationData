[1] "We found that the low-valence dopants (LVDs) lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation near them or far from them. This is true when they dope a reducible (CeO2) or an irreducible (MgO) oxide."

[2] "In irreducible oxides, high-valence dopants seem to always increase the energy of vacancy formation. This increase is small in very stable oxides (MgO and La2O3) and substantial in less-stable oxide (e.g., ZnO)."

[3] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopant–oxygen bonds that are much shorter than the Ce–O bonds in ceria."

[4] "We speculate that this is one the reasons for the similarity of their effect on ΔEv. The other reason is that their bonds with oxygen, in their own oxides, is much shorter than the Ce–O bond in CeO2. When one of these dopants replaces a Ce atom, it pulls the oxygen atoms in the oxide surface toward it and away from cerium. By doing this, they weaken the bond of the oxygen to the surface."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides differently depending on the nature of the host oxide:

1. In irreducible oxides like MgO, HVDs generally increase the energy of oxygen vacancy formation. This effect is small in very stable oxides but more substantial in less stable ones.

2. In reducible oxides like CeO2, the behavior of HVDs is more complex. Dopants such as Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, and W all lower the energy of vacancy formation by similar amounts, despite having very different chemical properties.

3. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) consistently lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation in both reducible and irreducible oxides, both near and far from the dopant site.

Computational studies have revealed that:

1. The effect of HVDs in reducible oxides like CeO2 is difficult to predict based on simple rules.
2. HVDs in CeO2 tend to create shorter dopant-oxygen bonds than the Ce-O bonds, pulling oxygen atoms away from cerium and weakening their bond to the surface.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:

1. The complex interplay between dopant properties and the host oxide's reducibility.
2. The difficulty in predicting long-range effects of dopants, especially in reducible oxides.
3. The need to consider both Lewis acid-base interactions and structural changes induced by dopants.

These insights highlight the need for continued computational and experimental studies to develop more comprehensive models for predicting dopant behavior in catalytic applications.

同价掺杂剂（SVD）和高价掺杂剂（HVD）对金属氧化物的催化性能的影响因宿主氧化物的性质而异：

1. 在不可还原的氧化物（如MgO）中，HVD通常会增加氧空位形成的能量。这种效应在非常稳定的氧化物中较小，但在较不稳定的氧化物中更为显著。

2. 在可还原的氧化物（如CeO2）中，HVD的行为更为复杂。像Pt、Ru、Zr、Ta、Nb、Mo和W这样的掺杂剂都以相似的程度降低了空位形成的能量，尽管它们具有非常不同的化学性质。

3. 低价掺杂剂（LVD）在可还原和不可还原的氧化物中都一致地降低了氧空位形成的能量，无论是在掺杂剂附近还是远离掺杂剂的位置。

计算研究揭示了：

1. 在可还原氧化物（如CeO2）中HVD的效果难以用简单的规则预测。
2. CeO2中的HVD倾向于创造比Ce-O键更短的掺杂剂-氧键，将氧原子从铈拉离，从而削弱它们与表面的键合。

制定掺杂剂行为一般预测规则的挑战包括：

1. 掺杂剂性质与宿主氧化物可还原性之间的复杂相互作用。
2. 难以预测掺杂剂的长程效应，特别是在可还原氧化物中。
3. 需要同时考虑路易斯酸碱相互作用和掺杂剂引起的结构变化。

这些见解强调了需要继续进行计算和实验研究，以开发更全面的模型来预测催化应用中掺杂剂的行为。
