[1] "The effect of Ga dopant in MgO(001) goes counter to the rules we have observed so far; the energy to make a vacancy next to this HVD is lower than the energy of vacancy formation on the undoped magnesia."

[2] "In irreducible oxides, high-valence dopants seem to always increase the energy of vacancy formation. This increase is small in very stable oxides (MgO and La2O3) and substantial in less-stable oxide (e.g., ZnO)."

[3] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopantoxygen bonds that are much shorter than the CeO bonds in ceria."

[4] "An examination of the projected density of states (PDOS) shows that W and Mo donate two electrons to ceria to reduce two Ce atoms, and Ta and Nb donate one electron to reduce one Ce atom. After this electron donation, these dopants have only four electrons available for making bonds, just like the Ce atom they replace."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides in different ways, depending on the nature of the host oxide. In irreducible oxides like MgO, HVDs generally increase the energy of vacancy formation, with the effect being more pronounced in less stable oxides. However, exceptions exist, such as Ga-doped MgO, where the energy to create a vacancy next to the dopant is lower than in undoped MgO.

For reducible oxides like CeO2, the influence of HVDs is more complex. Dopants such as Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, and W all lower the energy of vacancy formation by similar amounts, despite having very different chemical properties. This unexpected behavior is attributed to two factors: (1) these dopants all end up with four electrons available for bonding, like the Ce atom they replace, and (2) they create shorter dopant-oxygen bonds than the Ce-O bonds in ceria, weakening the oxygen's attachment to the surface.

Computational studies, particularly those involving projected density of states (PDOS) analysis, have provided insights into the electronic structure changes caused by dopants. For instance, W and Mo donate two electrons to reduce two Ce atoms, while Ta and Nb donate one electron to reduce one Ce atom in ceria.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to the complex interplay of factors such as the dopant's valence, its ability to form strong bonds with oxygen, and the reducibility of the host oxide. The case of Ga-doped MgO demonstrates that exceptions to general trends can occur, likely due to the reduction of the dopant itself during vacancy formation.

The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) plays a crucial role in determining dopant behavior. In irreducible oxides, the effects of dopants are more straightforward and predictable, while in reducible oxides like ceria, the interplay between dopant properties and the host oxide's ability to change oxidation states leads to more complex and sometimes counterintuitive results.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对金属氧化物的催化性能的影响方式不同，取决于宿主氧化物的性质。在不可还原的氧化物(如MgO)中，HVDs通常会增加空位形成的能量，这种效应在较不稳定的氧化物中更为明显。然而，也存在例外情况，例如Ga掺杂的MgO，其中在掺杂剂附近创建空位的能量低于未掺杂的MgO。

对于可还原的氧化物(如CeO2)，HVDs的影响更为复杂。Pt、Ru、Zr、Ta、Nb、Mo和W等掺杂剂都以相似的程度降低了空位形成的能量，尽管它们具有非常不同的化学性质。这种意外的行为归因于两个因素：(1)这些掺杂剂最终都有四个电子可用于成键，就像它们替换的Ce原子一样，(2)它们创建的掺杂剂-氧键比CeO2中的Ce-O键短，减弱了氧与表面的结合。

计算研究，特别是涉及投影态密度(PDOS)分析的研究，提供了关于掺杂剂引起的电子结构变化的洞察。例如，在CeO2中，W和Mo捐赠两个电子以还原两个Ce原子，而Ta和Nb捐赠一个电子以还原一个Ce原子。

由于掺杂剂价态、其与氧形成强键的能力以及宿主氧化物的可还原性等因素的复杂相互作用，制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则仍然面临挑战。Ga掺杂MgO的情况表明，可能出现与一般趋势相反的例外情况，这可能是由于空位形成过程中掺杂剂本身的还原所致。

宿主氧化物的性质（可还原与不可还原）在决定掺杂剂行为方面起着至关重要的作用。在不可还原的氧化物中，掺杂剂的效果更直接和可预测，而在可还原的氧化物（如CeO2）中，掺杂剂性质与宿主氧化物改变氧化态能力之间的相互作用导致了更复杂和有时反直觉的结果。
