[1] "The effect of substitutional doping of ceria on the chemistry of the surface has been studied previously, by density functional theory, for the following dopants: Pd, (6-8) Al, (9) Sc, (9) Y, (9) Ta, (10) Nb, (10) La, (11, 12) Zr, (8, 13, 14) Ir, (15) Cu, (16) Ni, (17) Au, (18-20) Ti, (14) Hf, (14) and Pt. (21)"

[2] "We find that the low-valence dopants (La and Y for CeO2 and Li and Na for MgO) have both a long-range and a short-range effect. High-valence dopants (Al, Sc, and Y) in MgO(001) slightly increase the energy of vacancy formation next to them, with the exception of Ga, which behaves differently because it is reduced when the vacancy is formed."

[3] "Doping CeO2(111) with Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W has no long-range effect on the energy of vacancy formation. In addition, these dopants affect the energy of vacancy formation next to them by roughly the same amount, even though the dopants have very different chemical properties."

[4] "It is very difficult to make doped oxides with all the dopant in the surface layer. XRD measurements show that some of the dopant is in the interior of the catalyst grains. It is, therefore, important to know if the dopants trapped inside the grain can affect the catalytic properties of the surface. If they do not, they are wasted, and this is troublesome when the dopant is expensive."

[5] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopant−oxygen bonds that are much shorter than the Ce−O bonds in ceria. This similarity is puzzling considering that the oxides of these dopants have vastly different enthalpies of formation."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides in different ways, depending on the nature of the host oxide. For irreducible oxides like MgO, HVDs generally increase the energy of vacancy formation, slightly increasing it next to the dopant. However, for reducible oxides like CeO2, the effect is more complex and less predictable.

Computational studies, particularly density functional theory calculations, have provided insights into the effects of various dopants on the surface chemistry of ceria. These studies have covered a wide range of dopants, including Pd, Al, Sc, Y, Ta, Nb, La, Zr, Ir, Cu, Ni, Au, Ti, Hf, and Pt.

Low-valence dopants (LVDs) in both reducible and irreducible oxides have been found to have both long-range and short-range effects on oxygen vacancy formation energy. In contrast, high-valence dopants in reducible oxides like CeO2 show no long-range effect but affect the vacancy formation energy near them by similar amounts, despite their different chemical properties.

A significant challenge in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior is the complex interplay between the dopant's chemical properties and the host oxide's nature. For instance, dopants like Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, and W in CeO2 all lower the vacancy formation energy similarly and create shorter dopant-oxygen bonds than Ce-O bonds in ceria. This similarity is puzzling given the vastly different enthalpies of formation of their respective oxides.

Another challenge is understanding the impact of dopants located in the interior of catalyst grains. XRD measurements show that not all dopants are on the surface, and it's crucial to determine if these internal dopants can affect the catalytic properties of the surface. This is particularly important for expensive dopants, as their effectiveness could be limited if trapped inside the grain.

The behavior of some dopants, like Ga in MgO, deviates from expected patterns, further complicating the formulation of general rules. In this case, Ga is reduced when a vacancy is formed, leading to unexpected effects on vacancy formation energy.

Overall, while computational and experimental studies have provided valuable insights, the complexity of dopant-host oxide interactions, particularly in reducible oxides, continues to challenge the development of comprehensive predictive models for dopant behavior in catalytic applications.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物的催化性能的影响方式不同，这取决于主体氧化物的性质。对于不可还原的氧化物如MgO，HVDs通常会增加空位形成能，在掺杂剂附近略微增加。然而，对于可还原的氧化物如CeO2，其影响更为复杂和难以预测。

计算研究，特别是密度泛函理论计算，为了解各种掺杂剂对氧化铈表面化学的影响提供了洞见。这些研究涵盖了广泛的掺杂剂，包括Pd、Al、Sc、Y、Ta、Nb、La、Zr、Ir、Cu、Ni、Au、Ti、Hf和Pt。

研究发现，在可还原和不可还原的氧化物中，低价掺杂剂（LVDs）对氧空位形成能都有长程和短程影响。相比之下，在可还原氧化物如CeO2中的高价掺杂剂没有长程影响，但它们对附近空位形成能的影响程度相似，尽管它们的化学性质不同。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的一个重大挑战是掺杂剂的化学性质与主体氧化物性质之间的复杂相互作用。例如，在CeO2中，Pt、Ru、Zr、Ta、Nb、Mo和W等掺杂剂都以相似的方式降低空位形成能，并创造出比氧化铈中Ce-O键更短的掺杂剂-氧键。考虑到它们各自氧化物的生成焓差异巨大，这种相似性令人困惑。

另一个挑战是理解位于催化剂晶粒内部的掺杂剂的影响。XRD测量表明，并非所有掺杂剂都在表面，因此确定这些内部掺杂剂是否能影响表面的催化性能至关重要。对于昂贵的掺杂剂来说，这一点尤为重要，因为如果被困在晶粒内部，它们的效果可能会受限。

一些掺杂剂的行为，如MgO中的Ga，偏离了预期模式，进一步复杂化了一般规则的制定。在这种情况下，当形成空位时，Ga被还原，导致对空位形成能产生意外影响。

总的来说，虽然计算和实验研究提供了宝贵的见解，但掺杂剂-主体氧化物相互作用的复杂性，特别是在可还原氧化物中，继续挑战着在催化应用中开发全面的掺杂剂行为预测模型。
