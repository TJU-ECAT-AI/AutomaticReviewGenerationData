[1] "We find that low-valence dopants (Na and Li dopants in MgO and La and Y dopants in CeO2) have both a long-range and a short-range effect. In contrast, Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Mo, and W dopants in CeO2(111) affect only the oxygen atoms next to them."

[2] "In irreducible oxides, high-valence dopants seem to always increase the energy of vacancy formation. This increase is small in very stable oxides (MgO and La2O3) and substantial in less-stable oxide (e.g., ZnO)."

[3] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopant–oxygen bonds that are much shorter than the Ce–O bonds in ceria."

[4] "It is very difficult to make doped oxides with all the dopant in the surface layer. XRD measurements show that some of the dopant is in the interior of the catalyst grains. It is, therefore, important to know if the dopants trapped inside the grain can affect the catalytic properties of the surface."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides in different ways, depending on the nature of the host oxide:

1. In irreducible oxides like MgO, HVDs tend to increase the energy of vacancy formation, with the effect being more pronounced in less stable oxides.

2. In reducible oxides like CeO2, HVDs (e.g., Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, W) lower the energy of vacancy formation by similar amounts, despite their different chemical properties. They shift oxygen atoms away from Ce, creating shorter dopant-oxygen bonds.

3. Low-valence dopants (e.g., Na, Li in MgO; La, Y in CeO2) have both long-range and short-range effects on oxygen vacancy formation.

Computational studies have revealed that the effect of dopants on vacancy formation energy is not always predictable based on their properties in their own oxides. This challenges the formulation of general predictive rules for dopant behavior.

Challenges in predicting dopant behavior include:

1. The complex interplay between dopant properties and host oxide characteristics (reducible vs. irreducible).
2. The difficulty in isolating the effects of Lewis acid-base interactions from other factors.
3. The influence of dopant location within the oxide structure, as some dopants may be trapped in the interior of catalyst grains.

These findings highlight the need for further research to develop more comprehensive models for predicting dopant behavior in different metal oxide systems, considering factors such as electronic structure, bond lengths, and the reducibility of the host oxide.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物的催化性能的影响方式不同，这取决于宿主氧化物的性质：

1. 在不可还原的氧化物（如MgO）中，HVDs往往会增加氧空位形成的能量，这种效应在较不稳定的氧化物中更为明显。

2. 在可还原的氧化物（如CeO2）中，HVDs（如Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, W）以相似的程度降低了氧空位形成的能量，尽管它们的化学性质不同。它们将氧原子从Ce处移开，形成更短的掺杂剂-氧键。

3. 低价掺杂剂（如MgO中的Na、Li；CeO2中的La、Y）对氧空位形成既有长程效应又有短程效应。

计算研究表明，掺杂剂对氧空位形成能的影响并不总是可以根据它们在自身氧化物中的性质来预测。这给制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则带来了挑战。

预测掺杂剂行为面临的挑战包括：

1. 掺杂剂性质与宿主氧化物特性（可还原vs不可还原）之间的复杂相互作用。
2. 难以将路易斯酸碱相互作用的效应与其他因素分离。
3. 掺杂剂在氧化物结构中的位置的影响，因为一些掺杂剂可能被困在催化剂颗粒的内部。

这些发现强调了需要进一步研究，以开发更全面的模型来预测不同金属氧化物系统中的掺杂剂行为，考虑电子结构、键长和宿主氧化物的可还原性等因素。
