[1] "The effect of Ga dopant in MgO(001) goes counter to the rules we have observed so far; the energy to make a vacancy next to this HVD is lower than the energy of vacancy formation on the undoped magnesia."

[2] "In irreducible oxides, high-valence dopants seem to always increase the energy of vacancy formation. This increase is small in very stable oxides (MgO and La2O3) and substantial in less-stable oxide (e.g., ZnO)."

[3] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopantoxygen bonds that are much shorter than the CeO bonds in ceria."

[4] "An examination of the projected density of states (PDOS) shows that W and Mo donate two electrons to ceria to reduce two Ce atoms, and Ta and Nb donate one electron to reduce one Ce atom. After this electron donation, these dopants have only four electrons available for making bonds, just like the Ce atom they replace."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides in different ways, depending on the nature of the host oxide. In irreducible oxides like MgO, HVDs generally increase the energy of vacancy formation, with the effect being more pronounced in less stable oxides. However, exceptions exist, such as Ga-doped MgO, where the energy to create a vacancy next to the dopant is lower than in undoped MgO.

For reducible oxides like CeO2, the influence of HVDs is more complex. Dopants such as Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, and W all lower the energy of vacancy formation by similar amounts, despite having very different chemical properties. This unexpected behavior is attributed to two factors: (1) these dopants all end up with four electrons available for bonding, like the Ce atom they replace, and (2) they create shorter dopant-oxygen bonds than the Ce-O bonds in ceria, weakening the oxygen's attachment to the surface.

Computational studies, particularly those involving projected density of states (PDOS) analysis, have provided insights into the electronic structure changes caused by dopants. For instance, W and Mo donate two electrons to reduce two Ce atoms, while Ta and Nb donate one electron to reduce one Ce atom in ceria.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to the complex interplay of factors such as the dopant's valence, its ability to form strong bonds with oxygen, and the reducibility of the host oxide. The case of Ga-doped MgO demonstrates that exceptions to general trends can occur, likely due to the reduction of the dopant itself during vacancy formation.

The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) plays a crucial role in determining dopant behavior. In irreducible oxides, the effects of dopants are more straightforward and predictable, while in reducible oxides like ceria, the interplay between dopant properties and the host oxide's ability to change oxidation states leads to more complex and sometimes counterintuitive results.

同价掺杂剂(SVDs)和高价掺杂剂(HVDs)对金属氧化物的催化性能的影响方式不同，取决于宿主氧化物的性质。在不可还原的氧化物(如MgO)中，HVDs通常会增加空位形成的能量，这种效应在较不稳定的氧化物中更为明显。然而，也存在例外情况，例如Ga掺杂的MgO，其中在掺杂剂附近创建空位的能量低于未掺杂的MgO。

对于可还原的氧化物(如CeO2)，HVDs的影响更为复杂。Pt、Ru、Zr、Ta、Nb、Mo和W等掺杂剂都以相似的程度降低了空位形成的能量，尽管它们具有非常不同的化学性质。这种意外的行为归因于两个因素：(1)这些掺杂剂最终都有四个电子可用于成键，就像它们替换的Ce原子一样，(2)它们创建的掺杂剂-氧键比CeO2中的Ce-O键短，减弱了氧与表面的结合。

计算研究，特别是涉及投影态密度(PDOS)分析的研究，提供了关于掺杂剂引起的电子结构变化的洞察。例如，在CeO2中，W和Mo捐赠两个电子以还原两个Ce原子，而Ta和Nb捐赠一个电子以还原一个Ce原子。

由于掺杂剂价态、其与氧形成强键的能力以及宿主氧化物的可还原性等因素的复杂相互作用，制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则仍然面临挑战。Ga掺杂MgO的情况表明，可能出现与一般趋势相反的例外情况，这可能是由于空位形成过程中掺杂剂本身的还原所致。

宿主氧化物的性质（可还原与不可还原）在决定掺杂剂行为方面起着至关重要的作用。在不可还原的氧化物中，掺杂剂的效果更直接和可预测，而在可还原的氧化物（如CeO2）中，掺杂剂性质与宿主氧化物改变氧化态能力之间的相互作用导致了更复杂和有时反直觉的结果。

[1] "We found that the low-valence dopants (LVDs) lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation near them or far from them. This is true when they dope a reducible (CeO2) or an irreducible (MgO) oxide."

[2] "In irreducible oxides, high-valence dopants seem to always increase the energy of vacancy formation. This increase is small in very stable oxides (MgO and La2O3) and substantial in less-stable oxide (e.g., ZnO)."

[3] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand.

[4] "We speculate that this is one the reasons for the similarity of their effect on ΔEv. The other reason is that their bonds with oxygen, in their own oxides, is much shorter than the Ce–O bond in CeO2. When one of these dopants replaces a Ce atom, it pulls the oxygen atoms in the oxide surface toward it and away from cerium. By doing this, they weaken the bond of the oxygen to the surface."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides in different ways, depending on the nature of the host oxide:

1. In irreducible oxides like MgO:
- Low-valence dopants (LVDs) lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation both near and far from the dopant site.
- High-valence dopants (HVDs) generally increase the energy of vacancy formation. This increase is small in very stable oxides like MgO and La2O3, but more substantial in less stable oxides like ZnO.

2. In reducible oxides like CeO2:
- LVDs also lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation both near and far from the dopant site.
- The behavior of HVDs and same-valence dopants (SVDs) is more complex and less predictable. For example, dopants like Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, and W all lower the energy of vacancy formation by similar amounts in CeO2, despite having different valences and very different chemical properties.

Computational studies have provided insights into the mechanisms behind these effects:
- LVDs create holes in the valence band, which can be filled by electrons left behind when oxygen vacancies are formed, lowering the overall energy.
- In CeO2, some HVDs (like W and Mo) donate electrons to reduce Ce atoms, effectively becoming tetravalent like the Ce they replace.
- Many dopants in CeO2 form shorter bonds with oxygen than Ce does, pulling oxygen atoms away from Ce and weakening their bond to the surface.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior include:
- The complex interplay between electronic effects (e.g., electron donation, hole creation) and structural effects (e.g., bond length changes).
- The different behaviors observed in reducible vs. irreducible oxides.
- The unexpected similarities in effects between dopants with very different chemical properties.
- The need to consider both local and long-range effects of dopants.

These findings highlight the importance of considering the specific host oxide and dopant combination when predicting catalytic behavior, rather than relying solely on general rules based on valence or chemical properties.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物的催化性能的影响方式不同，这取决于宿主氧化物的性质：

1. 在不可还原的氧化物（如MgO）中：
- 低价掺杂剂（LVDs）降低了氧空位形成的能量，无论是在掺杂剂附近还是远离掺杂剂的位置。
- 高价掺杂剂（HVDs）通常增加空位形成的能量。这种增加在非常稳定的氧化物（如MgO和La2O3）中很小，但在较不稳定的氧化物（如ZnO）中更显著。

2. 在可还原的氧化物（如CeO2）中：
- LVDs也降低了氧空位形成的能量，无论是在掺杂剂附近还是远离掺杂剂的位置。
- HVDs和同价掺杂剂（SVDs）的行为更为复杂和难以预测。例如，Pt、Ru、Zr、Ta、Nb、Mo和W等掺杂剂在CeO2中都以相似的程度降低了空位形成的能量，尽管它们具有不同的价态和非常不同的化学性质。

计算研究为这些效应的机制提供了见解：
- LVDs在价带中创造空穴，当形成氧空位时留下的电子可以填充这些空穴，从而降低总体能量。
- 在CeO2中，一些HVDs（如W和Mo）捐赠电子以还原Ce原子，有效地变成与它们替代的Ce相同的四价态。
- 许多掺杂剂在CeO2中与氧形成比Ce更短的键，将氧原子拉离Ce并削弱它们与表面的键合。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的挑战包括：
- 电子效应（如电子捐赠、空穴创造）和结构效应（如键长变化）之间的复杂相互作用。
- 在可还原和不可还原氧化物中观察到的不同行为。
- 化学性质非常不同的掺杂剂之间效应的意外相似性。
- 需要考虑掺杂剂的局部和长程效应。

这些发现强调了在预测催化行为时考虑特定宿主氧化物和掺杂剂组合的重要性，而不是仅仅依赖基于价态或化学性质的一般规则。

2. 难以预测掺杂剂的长程效应，特别是在可还原氧化物中。
3. 需要同时考虑路易斯酸碱相互作用和掺杂剂引起的结构变化。

[1] "The effect of substitutional doping of ceria on the chemistry of the surface has been studied previously, by density functional theory, for the following dopants: Pd, (6-8) Al, (9) Sc, (9) Y, (9) Ta, (10) Nb, (10) La, (11, 12) Zr, (8, 13, 14) Ir, (15) Cu, (16) Ni, (17) Au, (18-20) Ti, (14) Hf, (14) and Pt. (21)"

[2] "We find that the low-valence dopants (La and Y for CeO2 and Li and Na for MgO) have both a long-range and a short-range effect. High-valence dopants (Al, Sc, and Y) in MgO(001) slightly increase the energy of vacancy formation next to them, with the exception of Ga, which behaves differently because it is reduced when the vacancy is formed."

[3] "Doping CeO2(111) with Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W has no long-range effect on the energy of vacancy formation. In addition, these dopants affect the energy of vacancy formation next to them by roughly the same amount, even though the dopants have very different chemical properties."

[4] "It is very difficult to make doped oxides with all the dopant in the surface layer. XRD measurements show that some of the dopant is in the interior of the catalyst grains. It is, therefore, important to know if the dopants trapped inside the grain can affect the catalytic properties of the surface. If they do not, they are wasted, and this is troublesome when the dopant is expensive."

[5] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation in the surface of the reducible CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, or W is difficult to understand. They all lower the energy of vacancy formation by a similar amount, and they all manage to shift the oxygen atoms away from Ce to create dopant−oxygen bonds that are much shorter than the Ce−O bonds in ceria. This similarity is puzzling considering that the oxides of these dopants have vastly different enthalpies of formation."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides in different ways, depending on the nature of the host oxide. For irreducible oxides like MgO, HVDs generally increase the energy of vacancy formation, slightly increasing it next to the dopant. However, for reducible oxides like CeO2, the effect is more complex and less predictable.

Computational studies, particularly density functional theory calculations, have provided insights into the effects of various dopants on the surface chemistry of ceria. These studies have covered a wide range of dopants, including Pd, Al, Sc, Y, Ta, Nb, La, Zr, Ir, Cu, Ni, Au, Ti, Hf, and Pt.

Low-valence dopants (LVDs) in both reducible and irreducible oxides have been found to have both long-range and short-range effects on oxygen vacancy formation energy. In contrast, high-valence dopants in reducible oxides like CeO2 show no long-range effect but affect the vacancy formation energy near them by similar amounts, despite their different chemical properties.

A significant challenge in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior is the complex interplay between the dopant's chemical properties and the host oxide's nature. For instance, dopants like Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Nb, Mo, and W in CeO2 all lower the vacancy formation energy similarly and create shorter dopant-oxygen bonds than Ce-O bonds in ceria. This similarity is puzzling given the vastly different enthalpies of formation of their respective oxides.

Another challenge is understanding the impact of dopants located in the interior of catalyst grains. XRD measurements show that not all dopants are on the surface, and it's crucial to determine if these internal dopants can affect the catalytic properties of the surface. This is particularly important for expensive dopants, as their effectiveness could be limited if trapped inside the grain.

The behavior of some dopants, like Ga in MgO, deviates from expected patterns, further complicating the formulation of general rules. In this case, Ga is reduced when a vacancy is formed, leading to unexpected effects on vacancy formation energy.

Overall, while computational and experimental studies have provided valuable insights, the complexity of dopant-host oxide interactions, particularly in reducible oxides, continues to challenge the development of comprehensive predictive models for dopant behavior in catalytic applications.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物的催化性能的影响方式不同，这取决于主体氧化物的性质。对于不可还原的氧化物如MgO，HVDs通常会增加空位形成能，在掺杂剂附近略微增加。然而，对于可还原的氧化物如CeO2，其影响更为复杂和难以预测。

计算研究，特别是密度泛函理论计算，为了解各种掺杂剂对氧化铈表面化学的影响提供了洞见。这些研究涵盖了广泛的掺杂剂，包括Pd、Al、Sc、Y、Ta、Nb、La、Zr、Ir、Cu、Ni、Au、Ti、Hf和Pt。

研究发现，在可还原和不可还原的氧化物中，低价掺杂剂（LVDs）对氧空位形成能都有长程和短程影响。相比之下，在可还原氧化物如CeO2中的高价掺杂剂没有长程影响，但它们对附近空位形成能的影响程度相似，尽管它们的化学性质不同。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的一个重大挑战是掺杂剂的化学性质与主体氧化物性质之间的复杂相互作用。例如，在CeO2中，Pt、Ru、Zr、Ta、Nb、Mo和W等掺杂剂都以相似的方式降低空位形成能，并创造出比氧化铈中Ce-O键更短的掺杂剂-氧键。考虑到它们各自氧化物的生成焓差异巨大，这种相似性令人困惑。

另一个挑战是理解位于催化剂晶粒内部的掺杂剂的影响。XRD测量表明，并非所有掺杂剂都在表面，因此确定这些内部掺杂剂是否能影响表面的催化性能至关重要。对于昂贵的掺杂剂来说，这一点尤为重要，因为如果被困在晶粒内部，它们的效果可能会受限。

一些掺杂剂的行为，如MgO中的Ga，偏离了预期模式，进一步复杂化了一般规则的制定。在这种情况下，当形成空位时，Ga被还原，导致对空位形成能产生意外影响。

总的来说，虽然计算和实验研究提供了宝贵的见解，但掺杂剂-主体氧化物相互作用的复杂性，特别是在可还原氧化物中，继续挑战着在催化应用中开发全面的掺杂剂行为预测模型。
