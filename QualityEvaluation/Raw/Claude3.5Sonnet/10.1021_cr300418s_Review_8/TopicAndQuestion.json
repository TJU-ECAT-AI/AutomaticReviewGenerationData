    "QuestionEnglish": "How do same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) influence the catalytic properties of different metal oxides, and what insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies regarding their effects on performance in various catalytic applications? Additionally, what challenges persist in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior, considering factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible)?",
    "QuestionChinese": "同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）如何影响不同金属氧化物的催化性能，从计算和实验研究中获得了哪些关于它们在各种催化应用中对性能影响的见解？此外，在制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则时，考虑到诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物性质（可还原与不可还原）等因素，仍然存在哪些挑战？"
