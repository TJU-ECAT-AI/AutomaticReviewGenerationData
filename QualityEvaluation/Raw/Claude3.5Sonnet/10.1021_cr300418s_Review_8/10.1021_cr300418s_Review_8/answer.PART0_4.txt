[1] "All of these calculations show that the dopant affects favorably the properties of the host oxide."

[2] "In all cases, doping with an SVD improves performance. However, we were unable to formulate any simple rules regarding the SVDs in catalysis other than to say that they should be tried, especially if one tunes the properties of an oxide that is already an efficient catalyst."

[3] "Pala et al. (271) examined the effect of all substitutional dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the surface of ZnO. They showed that all HVDs increased the energy needed for removing a surface oxygen atom located near the dopant. This suggests that the HVDs can be used to hinder oxidation by the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."

[4] "Very few calculations have examined this kind of system. They allow us to make some guesses and extrapolations, but they need to be reinforced (or modified) by further work."

[5] "The examples presented here suggest that it may be difficult to find simple rules for the effects of flexible-valence dopants, especially if the host oxide is a reducible. More computational and experimental work is needed for clarifying the behavior of these systems."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) generally have positive effects on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, but their specific influences vary depending on the nature of the host oxide and the specific application.

SVDs have been shown to improve the performance of host oxides in various catalytic applications. Computational and experimental studies have demonstrated that SVDs can enhance properties such as oxygen release in CeO2, redox properties, and catalytic activity for reactions like CO oxidation, water-gas shift, and methane oxidation. However, despite these positive effects, researchers have been unable to formulate simple, general rules for SVD behavior in catalysis.

HVDs exhibit more complex behavior, which depends on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible. In irreducible oxides like ZnO, HVDs can increase the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, potentially hindering oxidation through the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, this doesn't necessarily make the host oxide a poor oxidation catalyst, as HVDs can activate adsorbed oxygen molecules, leading to alternative reaction pathways.

For reducible oxides, the effect of HVDs is less well understood due to limited computational studies. The reducible nature of the host oxide cations (e.g., Ce4+ to Ce3+) complicates the interaction with HVDs, making it challenging to predict their behavior without further research.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to several factors:

1. The complex interplay of Lewis acid-base interactions between dopants, host oxides, and adsorbates.
2. The reducible or irreducible nature of the host oxide, which significantly affects dopant behavior.
3. The presence of flexible-valence dopants (FVDs), which can adopt multiple valence states and exhibit unpredictable behavior, especially in reducible host oxides.
4. Limited computational and experimental studies on certain dopant-host oxide combinations, particularly for HVDs in reducible oxides and FVDs.

To develop more comprehensive and accurate predictive rules for dopant behavior, additional computational and experimental work is needed, especially focusing on the complex interactions between dopants, host oxides, and reactive species in catalytic processes.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）通常对金属氧化物的催化性能有正面影响，但它们的具体作用因宿主氧化物的性质和特定应用而异。

研究表明，SVDs可以提高宿主氧化物在各种催化应用中的性能。计算和实验研究证明，SVDs可以增强CeO2的氧释放、氧化还原性能，以及CO氧化、水气变换和甲烷氧化等反应的催化活性。然而，尽管有这些积极影响，研究人员仍无法为SVDs在催化中的行为制定简单的通用规则。

HVDs表现出更复杂的行为，这取决于宿主氧化物是否可还原。在不可还原的氧化物（如ZnO）中，HVDs可以增加形成氧空位所需的能量，可能会抑制通过Mars-van Krevelen机制的氧化。但这并不一定使宿主氧化物成为劣质的氧化催化剂，因为HVDs可以活化吸附的氧分子，导致替代反应途径。

对于可还原的氧化物，由于计算研究有限，HVDs的影响还不太清楚。宿主氧化物阳离子的可还原性质（例如Ce4+到Ce3+）使其与HVDs的相互作用变得复杂，因此在没有进一步研究的情况下很难预测它们的行为。

在制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则方面仍然存在挑战，主要由于以下因素：

1. 掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和吸附物之间Lewis酸碱相互作用的复杂性。
2. 宿主氧化物的可还原或不可还原性质，这显著影响掺杂剂的行为。
3. 灵活价态掺杂剂（FVDs）的存在，它们可以采用多种价态并表现出不可预测的行为，特别是在可还原的宿主氧化物中。
4. 对某些掺杂剂-宿主氧化物组合的计算和实验研究有限，特别是对可还原氧化物中的HVDs和FVDs。

为了开发更全面和准确的掺杂剂行为预测规则，需要进行额外的计算和实验工作，特别是关注催化过程中掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和反应物种之间的复杂相互作用。
