Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) generally have positive effects on the catalytic properties of metal oxides. Computational and experimental studies have shown that SVDs consistently improve the performance of host oxides in various catalytic applications. However, the effects of HVDs are more complex and depend on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible.

For irreducible oxides, HVDs act as Lewis bases due to their localized excess electrons. This can lead to increased oxygen binding and activation, potentially enhancing oxidation reactions through non-Mars-van Krevelen mechanisms. In reducible oxides like CeO2, HVDs can donate excess electrons to reduce host cations, altering the redox properties of the material.

Despite these insights, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging. The complexity arises from several factors:

1. The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) significantly influences dopant behavior.
2. Lewis acid-base interactions between dopants, host oxides, and reactants play a crucial role but can be difficult to predict.
3. The valence state of the dopant can vary, especially for flexible-valence dopants (FVDs), making their effects hard to generalize.
4. The concentration and distribution of dopants within the host oxide can affect their impact on catalytic properties.

To address these challenges, more comprehensive computational and experimental studies are needed, particularly for HVDs in reducible oxides and FVDs in various host materials. These studies should aim to elucidate the complex interplay between dopants, host oxides, and reactants under realistic catalytic conditions.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）通常对金属氧化物的催化性能有积极影响。计算和实验研究表明，SVDs在各种催化应用中持续改善宿主氧化物的性能。然而，HVDs的影响更为复杂，取决于宿主氧化物是否可还原。

对于不可还原的氧化物，HVDs由于其局部过剩电子而充当Lewis碱。这可能导致增加氧气结合和活化，潜在地通过非Mars-van Krevelen机制增强氧化反应。在可还原的氧化物（如CeO2）中，HVDs可以捐赠过剩电子以还原宿主阳离子，从而改变材料的氧化还原性质。

尽管有这些见解，制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则仍然具有挑战性。这种复杂性源于几个因素：

1. 宿主氧化物的性质（可还原与不可还原）显著影响掺杂剂的行为。
2. 掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和反应物之间的Lewis酸碱相互作用起着关键作用，但难以预测。
3. 掺杂剂的价态可能变化，特别是对于灵活价态掺杂剂（FVDs），使其影响难以概括。
4. 掺杂剂在宿主氧化物中的浓度和分布可能影响其对催化性能的影响。

为了解决这些挑战，需要进行更全面的计算和实验研究，特别是针对可还原氧化物中的HVDs和各种宿主材料中的FVDs。这些研究应旨在阐明掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和反应物在实际催化条件下的复杂相互作用。

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) significantly influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, but their effects differ based on the nature of the host oxide and the specific dopant.

SVDs generally improve the performance of host oxides in various catalytic applications. Computational and experimental studies have shown that SVDs favorably affect the properties of the host oxide. For example, research on doped CeO2 and TiO2 has demonstrated enhanced oxygen release, improved redox properties, and better performance in reactions such as CO oxidation, water-gas shift, and methane oxidation.

HVDs have more complex effects on host oxides, depending on whether the oxide is reducible or irreducible. In irreducible oxides, HVDs act as Lewis bases, localizing excess electrons on the dopant. This can lead to increased oxygen binding energy and hinder oxidation through the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, it may also activate adsorbed oxygen molecules, potentially creating new reaction pathways.

In reducible oxides, HVDs can donate excess electrons to reduce host cations (e.g., Ce4+ to Ce3+), altering the redox properties of the material. This behavior can significantly impact catalytic performance, though more research is needed to fully understand these effects.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to the complexity of Lewis acid-base interactions and the varying nature of host oxides. The behavior of flexible-valence dopants (FVDs) adds another layer of complexity, as their effects can be highly dependent on the specific system and conditions.

To develop more comprehensive predictive models, additional computational and experimental studies are needed, particularly for HVDs in reducible oxides and FVDs in various host materials. These studies should focus on understanding the interplay between dopants, host oxides, and reactants under different conditions to elucidate the underlying principles governing catalytic performance.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物的催化性能有显著影响，但其效果因宿主氧化物的性质和特定掺杂剂而异。

同价掺杂剂通常能改善宿主氧化物在各种催化应用中的性能。计算机模拟和实验研究表明，同价掺杂剂对宿主氧化物的性能有利。例如，对掺杂CeO2和TiO2的研究显示，它们能增强氧释放、改善氧化还原性能，并在CO氧化、水气变换和甲烷氧化等反应中表现更好。

高价掺杂剂对宿主氧化物的影响更为复杂，取决于氧化物是否可还原。在不可还原的氧化物中，高价掺杂剂作为路易斯碱，将过量电子局限在掺杂剂上。这可能导致氧结合能增加，抑制通过Mars-van Krevelen机制的氧化。然而，它也可能激活吸附的氧分子，可能创造新的反应途径。

在可还原的氧化物中，高价掺杂剂可以捐赠过量电子以还原宿主阳离子（例如，Ce4+还原为Ce3+），改变材料的氧化还原性质。这种行为可能显著影响催化性能，尽管需要更多研究来充分理解这些效应。

由于路易斯酸碱相互作用的复杂性和宿主氧化物性质的变化，制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则仍面临挑战。柔性价态掺杂剂（FVDs）的行为增加了另一层复杂性，因为它们的效果可能高度依赖于特定系统和条件。

为了开发更全面的预测模型，需要进行额外的计算机模拟和实验研究，特别是对可还原氧化物中的高价掺杂剂和各种宿主材料中的柔性价态掺杂剂。这些研究应该集中在理解掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和反应物在不同条件下的相互作用，以阐明控制催化性能的基本原理。

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) have significant influences on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, as revealed by computational and experimental studies.

SVDs generally improve the performance of host oxides in various catalytic applications. Calculations on systems like TiO2 and CeO2 doped with elements of the same valence show favorable effects on the properties of the host oxide. Experimental studies have demonstrated that SVDs can enhance oxygen release in CeO2 and improve performance in reactions such as CO oxidation, water-gas shift, and methane oxidation.

HVDs have more complex effects, depending on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible. In irreducible oxides like ZnO, HVDs increase the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, potentially hindering oxidation by the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, they can also activate adsorbed oxygen molecules, leading to alternative oxidation pathways.

In reducible oxides like CeO2, HVDs can interact with the host's ability to change oxidation states. For instance, high-valence dopants can donate electrons to reduce Ce4+ to Ce3+, affecting the oxide's redox properties.

Despite these insights, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging. The effects of dopants depend on various factors, including Lewis acid-base interactions and the nature of the host oxide. The complexity increases with flexible-valence dopants (FVDs), which can adopt multiple oxidation states.

Challenges in predicting dopant behavior arise from:
1. The varying effects of dopants in reducible vs. irreducible oxides
2. The complex interactions between dopants and host oxides, especially in reducible systems
3. The difficulty in experimentally determining the exact location and state of dopants in the host oxide
4. The unique behaviors of flexible-valence dopants, which can adopt multiple oxidation states

To address these challenges and develop more comprehensive predictive rules, further computational and experimental studies are needed, particularly focusing on the behavior of dopants in different types of host oxides and their interactions with various reactants in catalytic processes.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物的催化性能有显著影响，这一点已通过计算和实验研究得到证实。

SVDs通常能改善宿主氧化物在各种催化应用中的性能。对TiO2和CeO2等系统进行的掺杂计算表明，同价元素掺杂对宿主氧化物的性能有利。实验研究证明，SVDs可以增强CeO2的释氧能力，并改善CO氧化、水气变换和甲烷氧化等反应的性能。

HVDs的影响更为复杂，取决于宿主氧化物是否可还原。在ZnO等不可还原的氧化物中，HVDs增加了氧空位形成所需的能量，可能会抑制Mars-van Krevelen机制的氧化过程。然而，它们也可以活化吸附的氧分子，导致替代性的氧化途径。

在CeO2等可还原氧化物中，HVDs可以与宿主的氧化态变化能力相互作用。例如，高价掺杂剂可以捐赠电子将Ce4+还原为Ce3+，从而影响氧化物的氧化还原性质。

尽管有这些见解，但制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则仍然具有挑战性。掺杂剂的影响取决于多种因素，包括路易斯酸碱相互作用和宿主氧化物的性质。对于可灵活价态掺杂剂（FVDs），由于它们可以采取多种氧化态，情况变得更加复杂。

预测掺杂剂行为面临的挑战包括：
1. 掺杂剂在可还原和不可还原氧化物中的影响各不相同
2. 掺杂剂与宿主氧化物之间的复杂相互作用，特别是在可还原系统中
3. 实验上难以确定掺杂剂在宿主氧化物中的确切位置和状态
4. 可灵活价态掺杂剂的独特行为，它们可以采取多种氧化态

为了解决这些挑战并制定更全面的预测规则，需要进行更多的计算和实验研究，特别是关注掺杂剂在不同类型宿主氧化物中的行为，以及它们在催化过程中与各种反应物的相互作用。

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) generally have positive effects on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, but their influence depends on the nature of the host oxide.

For SVDs, computational and experimental studies consistently show that they favorably affect the properties of the host oxide and improve catalytic performance. This has been observed in various systems, such as Zr-doped CeO2 for methane activation and Pt-doped CeO2 for CO oxidation and water-gas shift reactions.

HVDs have more complex effects that depend on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible. In irreducible oxides, HVDs act as Lewis bases, localizing excess electrons on the dopant. This can lead to the activation of adsorbed oxygen molecules, potentially creating new reaction pathways. In reducible oxides, HVDs can donate their excess electrons to reduce the host oxide's cations, altering the redox properties of the material.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior stem from the complexity of interactions between dopants and host oxides. Factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions, the reducibility of the host oxide, and the flexibility of dopant valence states all contribute to this complexity. For example, flexible-valence dopants (FVDs) like vanadium can adopt multiple oxidation states, making their behavior difficult to predict.

The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) plays a crucial role in determining dopant behavior. In reducible oxides like CeO2, the ability of the host cations to change oxidation states adds another layer of complexity to the system. This makes it challenging to establish simple, universally applicable rules for dopant behavior across different oxide systems.

Overall, while significant insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies, the field still lacks comprehensive predictive models for dopant behavior in metal oxide catalysts. More research is needed to fully understand the interplay between dopants, host oxides, and catalytic performance across a wide range of systems and applications.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）通常对金属氧化物的催化性能有积极影响，但其影响取决于主体氧化物的性质。

对于SVDs，计算和实验研究一致表明，它们对主体氧化物的性能有利，并提高了催化性能。这在各种系统中都有观察到，例如用于甲烷活化的Zr掺杂CeO2和用于CO氧化和水气变换反应的Pt掺杂CeO2。

HVDs的影响更为复杂，取决于主体氧化物是否可还原。在不可还原的氧化物中，HVDs作为路易斯碱，将过量电子局部化在掺杂剂上。这可能导致吸附氧分子的活化，潜在地创造新的反应途径。在可还原的氧化物中，HVDs可以捐赠其过量电子以还原主体氧化物的阳离子，从而改变材料的氧化还原性质。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的挑战源于掺杂剂和主体氧化物之间相互作用的复杂性。诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用、主体氧化物的可还原性以及掺杂剂价态的灵活性等因素都contribute to这种复杂性。例如，像钒这样的灵活价态掺杂剂（FVDs）可以采取多种氧化态，使其行为难以预测。

主体氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）在决定掺杂剂行为方面起着至关重要的作用。在像CeO2这样的可还原氧化物中，主体阳离子改变氧化态的能力为系统增加了另一层复杂性。这使得在不同的氧化物系统中建立简单、普遍适用的掺杂剂行为规则变得具有挑战性。

总的来说，尽管从计算和实验研究中获得了重要见解，但该领域仍然缺乏全面的金属氧化物催化剂掺杂剂行为预测模型。需要进行更多研究以充分理解掺杂剂、主体氧化物和催化性能在各种系统和应用中的相互作用。

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) generally have positive effects on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, but their specific influences vary depending on the nature of the host oxide and the specific application.

SVDs have been shown to improve the performance of host oxides in various catalytic applications. Computational and experimental studies have demonstrated that SVDs can enhance properties such as oxygen release in CeO2, redox properties, and catalytic activity for reactions like CO oxidation, water-gas shift, and methane oxidation. However, despite these positive effects, researchers have been unable to formulate simple, general rules for SVD behavior in catalysis.

HVDs exhibit more complex behavior, which depends on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible. In irreducible oxides like ZnO, HVDs can increase the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, potentially hindering oxidation through the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, this doesn't necessarily make the host oxide a poor oxidation catalyst, as HVDs can activate adsorbed oxygen molecules, leading to alternative reaction pathways.

For reducible oxides, the effect of HVDs is less well understood due to limited computational studies. The reducible nature of the host oxide cations (e.g., Ce4+ to Ce3+) complicates the interaction with HVDs, making it challenging to predict their behavior without further research.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to several factors:

1. The complex interplay of Lewis acid-base interactions between dopants, host oxides, and adsorbates.
2. The reducible or irreducible nature of the host oxide, which significantly affects dopant behavior.
3. The presence of flexible-valence dopants (FVDs), which can adopt multiple valence states and exhibit unpredictable behavior, especially in reducible host oxides.
4. Limited computational and experimental studies on certain dopant-host oxide combinations, particularly for HVDs in reducible oxides and FVDs.

To develop more comprehensive and accurate predictive rules for dopant behavior, additional computational and experimental work is needed, especially focusing on the complex interactions between dopants, host oxides, and reactive species in catalytic processes.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）通常对金属氧化物的催化性能有正面影响，但它们的具体作用因宿主氧化物的性质和特定应用而异。

研究表明，SVDs可以提高宿主氧化物在各种催化应用中的性能。计算和实验研究证明，SVDs可以增强CeO2的氧释放、氧化还原性能，以及CO氧化、水气变换和甲烷氧化等反应的催化活性。然而，尽管有这些积极影响，研究人员仍无法为SVDs在催化中的行为制定简单的通用规则。

HVDs表现出更复杂的行为，这取决于宿主氧化物是否可还原。在不可还原的氧化物（如ZnO）中，HVDs可以增加形成氧空位所需的能量，可能会抑制通过Mars-van Krevelen机制的氧化。但这并不一定使宿主氧化物成为劣质的氧化催化剂，因为HVDs可以活化吸附的氧分子，导致替代反应途径。

对于可还原的氧化物，由于计算研究有限，HVDs的影响还不太清楚。宿主氧化物阳离子的可还原性质（例如Ce4+到Ce3+）使其与HVDs的相互作用变得复杂，因此在没有进一步研究的情况下很难预测它们的行为。

在制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则方面仍然存在挑战，主要由于以下因素：

1. 掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和吸附物之间Lewis酸碱相互作用的复杂性。
2. 宿主氧化物的可还原或不可还原性质，这显著影响掺杂剂的行为。
3. 灵活价态掺杂剂（FVDs）的存在，它们可以采用多种价态并表现出不可预测的行为，特别是在可还原的宿主氧化物中。
4. 对某些掺杂剂-宿主氧化物组合的计算和实验研究有限，特别是对可还原氧化物中的HVDs和FVDs。

为了开发更全面和准确的掺杂剂行为预测规则，需要进行额外的计算和实验工作，特别是关注催化过程中掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和反应物种之间的复杂相互作用。
