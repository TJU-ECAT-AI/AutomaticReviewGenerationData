[1] "All of these calculations show that the dopant affects favorably the properties of the host oxide."

[2] "In all cases, doping with an SVD improves performance. However, we were unable to formulate any simple rules regarding the SVDs in catalysis other than to say that they should be tried, especially if one tunes the properties of an oxide that is already an efficient catalyst."

[3] "If the host oxide is irreducible, this additional electron is localized on the dopant. (260, 272) This means that the dopant is a Lewis base, and this controls some of its chemistry."

[4] "A high-valence dopant in a reducible oxide (e.g., Ta dopant in CeO2) behaves differently. (258) Because Ce4+ cations are easily reduced to Ce3+ (Ce4+ is a Lewis acid), an HVD can donate its excess electrons to reduce Ce ions in the host oxide."

[5] "The few existing calculations suggest that Lewis bases adsorbed on the surface are able to reduce Ce4+ to Ce3+ (or Ti4+ to Ti3+)."

[6] "More complications arise if one considers that tetravalent and divalent vanadium are also possible. This is why we classify a V-dopant in a MeO2 host oxide as being a flexible-valence dopant (FVD). Not much is known about the general behavior of such systems."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) generally have positive effects on the catalytic properties of metal oxides, but their influence depends on the nature of the host oxide.

For SVDs, computational and experimental studies consistently show that they favorably affect the properties of the host oxide and improve catalytic performance. This has been observed in various systems, such as Zr-doped CeO2 for methane activation and Pt-doped CeO2 for CO oxidation and water-gas shift reactions.

HVDs have more complex effects that depend on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible. In irreducible oxides, HVDs act as Lewis bases, localizing excess electrons on the dopant. This can lead to the activation of adsorbed oxygen molecules, potentially creating new reaction pathways. In reducible oxides, HVDs can donate their excess electrons to reduce the host oxide's cations, altering the redox properties of the material.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior stem from the complexity of interactions between dopants and host oxides. Factors such as Lewis acid-base interactions, the reducibility of the host oxide, and the flexibility of dopant valence states all contribute to this complexity. For example, flexible-valence dopants (FVDs) like vanadium can adopt multiple oxidation states, making their behavior difficult to predict.

The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) plays a crucial role in determining dopant behavior. In reducible oxides like CeO2, the ability of the host cations to change oxidation states adds another layer of complexity to the system. This makes it challenging to establish simple, universally applicable rules for dopant behavior across different oxide systems.

Overall, while significant insights have been gained from computational and experimental studies, the field still lacks comprehensive predictive models for dopant behavior in metal oxide catalysts. More research is needed to fully understand the interplay between dopants, host oxides, and catalytic performance across a wide range of systems and applications.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）通常对金属氧化物的催化性能有积极影响，但其影响取决于主体氧化物的性质。

对于SVDs，计算和实验研究一致表明，它们对主体氧化物的性能有利，并提高了催化性能。这在各种系统中都有观察到，例如用于甲烷活化的Zr掺杂CeO2和用于CO氧化和水气变换反应的Pt掺杂CeO2。

HVDs的影响更为复杂，取决于主体氧化物是否可还原。在不可还原的氧化物中，HVDs作为路易斯碱，将过量电子局部化在掺杂剂上。这可能导致吸附氧分子的活化，潜在地创造新的反应途径。在可还原的氧化物中，HVDs可以捐赠其过量电子以还原主体氧化物的阳离子，从而改变材料的氧化还原性质。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则面临的挑战源于掺杂剂和主体氧化物之间相互作用的复杂性。诸如路易斯酸碱相互作用、主体氧化物的可还原性以及掺杂剂价态的灵活性等因素都contribute to这种复杂性。例如，像钒这样的灵活价态掺杂剂（FVDs）可以采取多种氧化态，使其行为难以预测。

主体氧化物的性质（可还原vs.不可还原）在决定掺杂剂行为方面起着至关重要的作用。在像CeO2这样的可还原氧化物中，主体阳离子改变氧化态的能力为系统增加了另一层复杂性。这使得在不同的氧化物系统中建立简单、普遍适用的掺杂剂行为规则变得具有挑战性。

总的来说，尽管从计算和实验研究中获得了重要见解，但该领域仍然缺乏全面的金属氧化物催化剂掺杂剂行为预测模型。需要进行更多研究以充分理解掺杂剂、主体氧化物和催化性能在各种系统和应用中的相互作用。
