          "All of these calculations show that the dopant affects favorably the properties of the host oxide."

"In all cases, doping with an SVD improves performance. However, we were unable to formulate any simple rules regarding the SVDs in catalysis other than to say that they should be tried, especially if one tunes the properties of an oxide that is already an efficient catalyst."

"The effect of high-valence dopants on the chemistry of the host oxide is more complex than that of LVDs because it depends on whether the host is reducible or not."

"If the host oxide is irreducible, this additional electron is localized on the dopant. (260, 272) This means that the dopant is a Lewis base, and this controls some of its chemistry."

"A high-valence dopant in a reducible oxide (e.g., Ta dopant in CeO2) behaves differently. (258) Because Ce4+ cations are easily reduced to Ce3+ (Ce4+ is a Lewis acid), an HVD can donate its excess electrons to reduce Ce ions in the host oxide."

"Pala et al. (271) examined the effect of all substitutional dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the surface of ZnO. They showed that all HVDs increased the energy needed for removing a surface oxygen atom located near the dopant. This suggests that the HVDs can be used to hinder oxidation by the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."

"The examples presented here suggest that it may be difficult to find simple rules for the effects of flexible-valence dopants, especially if the host oxide is a reducible. More computational and experimental work is needed for clarifying the behavior of these systems."

          Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) significantly influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, as revealed by computational and experimental studies. SVDs generally improve the performance of host oxides in various catalytic applications. Calculations show that SVDs favorably affect the properties of the host oxide, enhancing performance in reactions such as CO oxidation, water-gas shift, and methane oxidation.

HVDs have more complex effects, depending on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible. In irreducible oxides like ZnO, HVDs increase the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, potentially hindering oxidation by the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, they can also activate adsorbed oxygen molecules, leading to alternative oxidation pathways.

In reducible oxides like CeO2, HVDs can interact with the host's ability to change oxidation states. For instance, high-valence dopants can donate electrons to reduce Ce4+ to Ce3+, affecting the oxide's redox properties.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to various factors:
1. The varying effects of dopants in reducible vs. irreducible oxides
2. The complex interactions between dopants and host oxides, especially in reducible systems
3. The difficulty in experimentally determining the exact location and state of dopants in the host oxide
4. The unique behaviors of flexible-valence dopants, which can adopt multiple oxidation states

To address these challenges and develop more comprehensive predictive rules, further computational and experimental studies are needed, particularly focusing on the behavior of dopants in different types of host oxides and their interactions with various reactants in catalytic processes.

          同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物的催化性能有显著影响，这一点已通过计算和实验研究得到证实。SVDs通常能改善宿主氧化物在各种催化应用中的性能。计算表明，SVDs对宿主氧化物的性能有利，提高了CO氧化、水气变换和甲烷氧化等反应的性能。

HVDs的影响更为复杂，取决于宿主氧化物是否可还原。在ZnO等不可还原的氧化物中，HVDs增加了氧空位形成所需的能量，可能会抑制Mars-van Krevelen机制的氧化过程。然而，它们也可以活化吸附的氧分子，导致替代性的氧化途径。

在CeO2等可还原氧化物中，HVDs可以与宿主的氧化态变化能力相互作用。例如，高价掺杂剂可以捐赠电子将Ce4+还原为Ce3+，从而影响氧化物的氧化还原性质。

制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则仍面临挑战，主要原因包括：
1. 掺杂剂在可还原和不可还原氧化物中的影响各不相同
2. 掺杂剂与宿主氧化物之间的复杂相互作用，特别是在可还原系统中
3. 实验上难以确定掺杂剂在宿主氧化物中的确切位置和状态
4. 可灵活价态掺杂剂的独特行为，它们可以采取多种氧化态

为了解决这些挑战并制定更全面的预测规则，需要进行更多的计算和实验研究，特别是关注掺杂剂在不同类型宿主氧化物中的行为，以及它们在催化过程中与各种反应物的相互作用。
