[1] "All of these calculations show that the dopant affects favorably the properties of the host oxide."

[2] "In all cases, doping with an SVD improves performance. However, we were unable to formulate any simple rules regarding the SVDs in catalysis other than to say that they should be tried, especially if one tunes the properties of an oxide that is already an efficient catalyst."

[3] "If the host oxide is irreducible, this additional electron is localized on the dopant. (260, 272) This means that the dopant is a Lewis base, and this controls some of its chemistry."

[4] "Because Ce4+ cations are easily reduced to Ce3+ (Ce4+ is a Lewis acid), an HVD can donate its excess electrons to reduce Ce ions in the host oxide."

[5] "The examples presented here suggest that it may be difficult to find simple rules for the effects of flexible-valence dopants, especially if the host oxide is a reducible. More computational and experimental work is needed for clarifying the behavior of these systems."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) generally have positive effects on the catalytic properties of metal oxides. Computational and experimental studies have shown that SVDs consistently improve the performance of host oxides in various catalytic applications. However, the effects of HVDs are more complex and depend on whether the host oxide is reducible or irreducible.

For irreducible oxides, HVDs act as Lewis bases due to their localized excess electrons. This can lead to increased oxygen binding and activation, potentially enhancing oxidation reactions through non-Mars-van Krevelen mechanisms. In reducible oxides like CeO2, HVDs can donate excess electrons to reduce host cations, altering the redox properties of the material.

Despite these insights, formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior remains challenging. The complexity arises from several factors:

1. The nature of the host oxide (reducible vs. irreducible) significantly influences dopant behavior.
2. Lewis acid-base interactions between dopants, host oxides, and reactants play a crucial role but can be difficult to predict.
3. The valence state of the dopant can vary, especially for flexible-valence dopants (FVDs), making their effects hard to generalize.
4. The concentration and distribution of dopants within the host oxide can affect their impact on catalytic properties.

To address these challenges, more comprehensive computational and experimental studies are needed, particularly for HVDs in reducible oxides and FVDs in various host materials. These studies should aim to elucidate the complex interplay between dopants, host oxides, and reactants under realistic catalytic conditions.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）通常对金属氧化物的催化性能有积极影响。计算和实验研究表明，SVDs在各种催化应用中持续改善宿主氧化物的性能。然而，HVDs的影响更为复杂，取决于宿主氧化物是否可还原。

对于不可还原的氧化物，HVDs由于其局部过剩电子而充当Lewis碱。这可能导致增加氧气结合和活化，潜在地通过非Mars-van Krevelen机制增强氧化反应。在可还原的氧化物（如CeO2）中，HVDs可以捐赠过剩电子以还原宿主阳离子，从而改变材料的氧化还原性质。

尽管有这些见解，制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则仍然具有挑战性。这种复杂性源于几个因素：

1. 宿主氧化物的性质（可还原与不可还原）显著影响掺杂剂的行为。
2. 掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和反应物之间的Lewis酸碱相互作用起着关键作用，但难以预测。
3. 掺杂剂的价态可能变化，特别是对于灵活价态掺杂剂（FVDs），使其影响难以概括。
4. 掺杂剂在宿主氧化物中的浓度和分布可能影响其对催化性能的影响。

为了解决这些挑战，需要进行更全面的计算和实验研究，特别是针对可还原氧化物中的HVDs和各种宿主材料中的FVDs。这些研究应旨在阐明掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和反应物在实际催化条件下的复杂相互作用。
