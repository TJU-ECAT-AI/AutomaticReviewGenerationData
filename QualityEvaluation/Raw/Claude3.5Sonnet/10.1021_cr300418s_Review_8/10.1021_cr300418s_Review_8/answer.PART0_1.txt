[1] "All of these calculations show that the dopant affects favorably the properties of the host oxide."

[2] "In all cases, doping with an SVD improves performance. However, we were unable to formulate any simple rules regarding the SVDs in catalysis other than to say that they should be tried, especially if one tunes the properties of an oxide that is already an efficient catalyst."

[3] "The effect of high-valence dopants on the chemistry of the host oxide is more complex than that of LVDs because it depends on whether the host is reducible or not."

[4] "If the host oxide is irreducible, this additional electron is localized on the dopant. (260, 272) This means that the dopant is a Lewis base, and this controls some of its chemistry."

[5] "A high-valence dopant in a reducible oxide (e.g., Ta dopant in CeO2) behaves differently. (258) Because Ce4+ cations are easily reduced to Ce3+ (Ce4+ is a Lewis acid), an HVD can donate its excess electrons to reduce Ce ions in the host oxide."

[6] "More complications arise if one considers that tetravalent and divalent vanadium are also possible. This is why we classify a V-dopant in a MeO2 host oxide as being a flexible-valence dopant (FVD). Not much is known about the general behavior of such systems."

Same-valence dopants (SVDs) and high-valence dopants (HVDs) significantly influence the catalytic properties of metal oxides, but their effects differ based on the nature of the host oxide and the specific dopant.

SVDs generally improve the performance of host oxides in various catalytic applications. Computational and experimental studies have shown that SVDs favorably affect the properties of the host oxide. For example, research on doped CeO2 and TiO2 has demonstrated enhanced oxygen release, improved redox properties, and better performance in reactions such as CO oxidation, water-gas shift, and methane oxidation.

HVDs have more complex effects on host oxides, depending on whether the oxide is reducible or irreducible. In irreducible oxides, HVDs act as Lewis bases, localizing excess electrons on the dopant. This can lead to increased oxygen binding energy and hinder oxidation through the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, it may also activate adsorbed oxygen molecules, potentially creating new reaction pathways.

In reducible oxides, HVDs can donate excess electrons to reduce host cations (e.g., Ce4+ to Ce3+), altering the redox properties of the material. This behavior can significantly impact catalytic performance, though more research is needed to fully understand these effects.

Challenges in formulating general predictive rules for dopant behavior persist due to the complexity of Lewis acid-base interactions and the varying nature of host oxides. The behavior of flexible-valence dopants (FVDs) adds another layer of complexity, as their effects can be highly dependent on the specific system and conditions.

To develop more comprehensive predictive models, additional computational and experimental studies are needed, particularly for HVDs in reducible oxides and FVDs in various host materials. These studies should focus on understanding the interplay between dopants, host oxides, and reactants under different conditions to elucidate the underlying principles governing catalytic performance.

同价掺杂剂（SVDs）和高价掺杂剂（HVDs）对金属氧化物的催化性能有显著影响，但其效果因宿主氧化物的性质和特定掺杂剂而异。

同价掺杂剂通常能改善宿主氧化物在各种催化应用中的性能。计算机模拟和实验研究表明，同价掺杂剂对宿主氧化物的性能有利。例如，对掺杂CeO2和TiO2的研究显示，它们能增强氧释放、改善氧化还原性能，并在CO氧化、水气变换和甲烷氧化等反应中表现更好。

高价掺杂剂对宿主氧化物的影响更为复杂，取决于氧化物是否可还原。在不可还原的氧化物中，高价掺杂剂作为路易斯碱，将过量电子局限在掺杂剂上。这可能导致氧结合能增加，抑制通过Mars-van Krevelen机制的氧化。然而，它也可能激活吸附的氧分子，可能创造新的反应途径。

在可还原的氧化物中，高价掺杂剂可以捐赠过量电子以还原宿主阳离子（例如，Ce4+还原为Ce3+），改变材料的氧化还原性质。这种行为可能显著影响催化性能，尽管需要更多研究来充分理解这些效应。

由于路易斯酸碱相互作用的复杂性和宿主氧化物性质的变化，制定掺杂剂行为的一般预测规则仍面临挑战。柔性价态掺杂剂（FVDs）的行为增加了另一层复杂性，因为它们的效果可能高度依赖于特定系统和条件。

为了开发更全面的预测模型，需要进行额外的计算机模拟和实验研究，特别是对可还原氧化物中的高价掺杂剂和各种宿主材料中的柔性价态掺杂剂。这些研究应该集中在理解掺杂剂、宿主氧化物和反应物在不同条件下的相互作用，以阐明控制催化性能的基本原理。
