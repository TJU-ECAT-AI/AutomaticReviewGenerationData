Abstract
The formation of retained hydrocarbons or coke in the conversion of methanol and dimethylether to hydrocarbons over zeolite H-MFI
was studied using ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy. Polyolefin, cyclopentadienyl species, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons have been identified
among the retained hydrocarbons from the Raman spectra. The results strongly support a reaction mechanism, proposed previously, where
cyclopentadienyl species are identified as a key intermediate in the formation of aromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons by ring expansion.
The spectra also suggest that the polyaromatic hydrocarbons have a chain-like topology, similar to polycenes, rather than a two-dimensional,
sheet-like topology, similar to pyrene or coronene.

1. Introduction
The deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts caused by the
build-up of carbonaceous deposits or coke is an issue of con-
cern for many industrial chemical processes. As a conse-
quence, a great deal of research has focused on the mech-
anism of coke formation, the chemical nature of coke, and
methods for its removal. Coke formation in zeolites or mole-
cular sieves has received particular attention both because of
their importance in industrial chemistry and because the net-
work of nanoscale channels and cavities that impart their de-
sirable shape-selective catalytic properties also make them
especially susceptible to blockage by coke build-up. Much
of this work has centered on determining the chemical nature
of the coke deposit. Typically, in these studies, the zeolite
matrix is dissolved in hydrofluoric acid, followed by solvent
extraction of the organic coke and traditional chemical sepa-
rations and analysis to determine the chemical constituents.
While this is an effective procedure for gaining access to the
chemical species that are otherwise locked in the pores of
the zeolite and dealing with a chemically complex material,
it is a laborious process, and the mechanism of coke forma-

tion can be deduced only indirectly from the nature of the
final coke produced.
In the present paper we describe an investigation, using
in situ ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy, which looks directly
into the nature of the chemical species retained in the cata-
lyst under the conditions of the methanol-to-hydrocarbons
(MTH) process catalyzed by zeolite H-MFI. MTH chem-
istry has been studied extensively, and a number of excellent
reviews have appeared [13]. A simplified representation
of the MTH process is shown in Scheme 1. Methanol and
dimethylether rapidly equilibrate at a reaction temperature
of 360 C. This equilibrium mixture reacts to form a range
of light olefins which subsequently react further to form a
mixture of paraffinic, olefinic, and aromatic hydrocarbons.
The product distribution can be controlled, within limits, by
the reaction conditions. Coke formation during this reaction
has also been studied extensively. There is general agree-
ment as to the location and chemical nature of the carbona-

ceous deposits that make up the coke and on its evolution
with time [38]. However, there is only indirect information
on the reaction pathway(s) to form coke [9,10]. In particular,
Schulz and Wei [11] proposed a detailed reaction scheme
(see Scheme 2) for coke formation under low-temperature
reaction conditions. This reaction scheme is based (1) on
previous observations of UV absorption bands that are con-
sistent with the presence of highly unsaturated hydrocarbons
retained in the zeolite [12], (2) on the recovery of alkyl-
substituted benzene from used H-MFI catalysts [11], and (3)
on sensible, acid-catalyzed organic chemistry [11]. In this
paper, we present UV Raman spectra measured at several
reaction times during the formation and transformation of
retained hydrocarbons formed under various conditions of
MTH catalyzed by zeolite H-MFI. These spectra provide di-
rect evidence for two of the chemical species proposed in
Scheme 2 and suggest a topology for the polyaromatic hy-
drocarbons that are the ultimate products of coke formation
chemistry.
2. Experimental
In situ UV Raman spectroscopy measurements were
performed using a fluidized bed reactor/Raman cell. Briefly,
the catalyst, in the form of a loose powder, was placed on a
stainless steel porous disk located near the end of a vertical
stainless steel tube, which also served as the gas inlet. The
stainless steel tube assembly was surrounded by a concentric
quartz tube with the top end sealed by a UV-transparent
window for Raman spectroscopic measurements. The space
between the inner stainless steel tube and the outer quartz
tube served as the gas outlet. An oven surrounded the entire
assembly to provide heating for catalyst pretreatment and
elevated reaction temperatures. Gas flow and mechanical
vibration were adjusted to produce stirring of the catalyst
powder without lifting the powder bed off the porous disk.
All spectra were measured using 244-nm radiation at a
power of 2 mW. Data collection times varied from 500 s
to 2 h depending on signal levels. Details of the UV Raman
instrument [1317] and the fluidized bed reactor [18] have
been described previously.
The H-MFI zeolite (Si/Al = 90) used in this study
was provided by BP Amoco Chemical Company. Methanol
(99.93% HPLC grade; Aldrich) and dimethylether (99+%;
Aldrich) were used as starting reagents without further
purification. In a typical experiment, 200 mg of catalyst
was placed in the fluidized bed reactor and calcined at
500 C in oxygen (60 ml/min) for 2 h. The temperature
was lowered to the appropriate reaction temperature and
oxygen was switched to helium. Methanol was introduced to
the reactor by admitting helium (30 ml/min) into a bubbler
containing the liquid. For dimethylether, the gas was allowed
to flow into the reactor at a rate of 15 ml/min in 30 ml/min
of helium. After a timed dose of reagent was passed through
the catalyst bed, the gas flow was switched to helium. The
doses cited in the results are given as molecules per zeolite
unit cell based on the known volume of reagent gas passed
through a measured quantity of catalyst. UV Raman spectra
were measured in flowing helium at reaction temperature.
Since recording the Raman spectra required lengthy signal
averaging and the fluidizing gas contained no hydrocarbon
reagent during the measurements, the spectra characterize
only the stable, nonvolatile carbonaceous species in the
zeolite after various contact times. Volatile reactants and
products would desorb during the initial portion of the signal
averaging interval.
3. Results
At all the reaction temperatures studied, a weak band at
2910 to 2940 cm1 was observed in the CH stretching
region. The position of this band is consistent with an
alkyl hydrocarbon CH stretch rather than an aromatic
hydrocarbon CH stretch, which appears near 3050 cm1.
3.1. Reaction at 360 C
Figure 1 shows spectra in the CC stretching and CH
deformation region after various doses of methanol as the
starting reactant. Spectrum a was measured from calcined
H-MFI prior to reaction. The bands at 805 cm1 and
1000 to 1250 cm1 correspond to symmetric and
asymmetric stretching vibrations, respectively, of TOT
units in the zeolite framework, where T is either Si or
Al [19,20]. The indicated doses correspond to the number
of reagent molecules per MFI unit cell, calculated from
the measured volume flow rate and the vapor pressure of
methanol at 25 C. Spectrum b corresponds to a methanol

dose of 1.5 molecules per unit cell. Following this dose,
several strong bands appear between 1000 and 1700 cm1.
There is no detectable signal from molecular methanol.
To distinguish which of the overlapping bands from 
1300 to 1450 cm1 are due to CH deformations and
which are due to CC stretches, experiments with deuterated
methanol, CD3OH, were also conducted. With the exception
of the peak at 1200 cm1, no significant deuterium shifts
are observed for these bands (spectrum c), indicating that
the bands are associated with CC stretching vibrations.
This Raman spectrum (and all others reported here) is
stable with time, at a constant temperature, following the
methanol dose. When the methanol dose was increased to
7.5 molecules per unit cell, the relative intensity of the
band at 1550 cm1 decreased, and the bands near 1360 and
1605 cm1 increased (spectrum d). The bands due to zeolite
vibrations are no longer detectable due to strong absorption
of the UV light by the retained hydrocarbons. Spectrum e
was recorded after a large methanol dose corresponding to
an additional 3600 molecules per unit cell. The intensity
and band shape in the region 1300 to 1450 cm1 and the
intensity of the band near 1605 cm1 remained essentially
unchanged. The 1550 cm1 band intensity decreased to the
point where it was barely detectable.
Raman spectra measured during coke formation with
dimethylether as the starting reagent are very similar to
Fig. 1. At this reaction temperature, it has been shown
that rapid equilibrium is achieved between methanol and
dimethylether [2,3,21]. Therefore, at 360 C, it does not
matter which of the two compoundsis the starting reagent, as
the equilibrium between the two species is quickly attained
before further reactions occur.
3.2. Reaction at 270 C
Figure 2 shows spectra in the CC stretching and CH
deformation region after low and high doses of methanol.
Spectrum a was measured from calcined H-MFI prior to
reaction. The activity of the catalyst for methanol conversion
was significantly lower at 270 C than 360 C so that
larger methanol doses were required to obtain detectable
concentrations of retained hydrocarbons in the zeolite in
Fig. 2 compared to Fig. 1. Spectrum b corresponds to a
methanol dose of 30 molecules per unit cell. Following
this dose, the strong bands between 1000 and 1700 cm1,

observed in Fig. 1 are also present in Fig. 2. However, an
additional prominent band is observed at 1483 cm1. To
distinguish which of the overlapping bands from 1300 to
1450 cm1 are due to CH deformations and which are
due to CC stretches, experiments with CD3OH were also
conducted. No significant deuterium shifts are observed for
these bands (spectrum c), indicating that the bands are due to
CC stretches. When the methanol dose was increased to 720
molecules per unit cell, the band at 1483 cm1 disappeared,
the intensity of the band at 1550 cm1 decreased, and a band
near 1365 cm1 increased (spectrum d). The bands due to
zeolite vibrations are no longer detectable.
3.3. Reaction at 200 C
Figure 3 shows the UV Raman spectra measured af-
ter dosing methanol at 200 C. Spectrum a was measured
from calcined zeolite H-MFI before reaction. Spectrum b
was measured after dosing 720 molecules per unit cell. The
805 cm1 due to the zeolite is only very slightly attenuated,
consistent with a small accumulation of hydrocarbon species
and a low reactivity at this temperature. Spectrum c, mea-
sured after dosing 4320 molecules per unit cell, is very sim-
ilar to the spectrum measured from the smallest methanol
dose at 360 C (Fig. 1). There is no detectable band at

1483 cm1 from methanol dosing at 200 C. After dosing
6 molecules of dimethylether per unit cell at 200 C, the
1483 cm1 band is very pronounced (Fig. 4b). Spectrum b
is very similar, but not identical, to the spectrum measured
after dosing 30 molecules of methanol at 270 C (Fig. 2b).
The 1483 cm1 peak decreases but remains detectable with
additional dimethylether dosing up to 2350 molecules per
unit cell (Fig. 4c). However, the species responsible for the
band at 1483 cm1 is thermally unstable. After the sample of
Fig. 4b is heated to 360 C the 1483 cm1 band is no longer
detectable, and the spectrum is similar to that obtained after
high doses of methanol at 360 C (Fig. 1e).
4. Discussion
4.1. Band assignments
The spectra shown in Figs. 14 are clearly from a com-
plex mixture of chemical species. However, it is possible to
make band assignments to general classes of molecular vi-
brations and chemical species. The Raman band assignments
for vibrations in the region from 1000 to 1650 cm1 are
listed in Table 1. Except for the bands at 1483 cm1 and

15451550 cm1, the vibrational features are assigned to
CC or ring stretches of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. These
assignments are based on the small deuterium isotope shifts
observed with deuterated reagents and on a comparison to
the UV Raman spectra of a series of polyaromatic com-
pounds, naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluorene,
pyrene, pentacene, and coronene, shown in Fig. 5. UV Ra-
man measurements for some of these compounds have been
reported previously by Asher and co-workers [22,23]. The
polyaromatic compounds typically have strong bands in two
spectral regions, 1300 to 1450 cm1 and 1600 to
1650 cm1, as do the spectra from retained hydrocar-
bons. Interestingly, the intensity in the spectral region 1600
to 1650 cm1 is significantly higher than that in the re-
gion 1300 to 1450 cm1 for the polyaromatic compounds
with a two-dimensional, sheet-like topology (pyrene and
coronene). By contrast, the intensity is more nearly equal in
these two spectral regions for the polyaromatic compounds
with chainlike topologies (phenanthrene, anthracene, and
pentacene). The spectra measured from the retained hydro-
carbons in H-MFI exhibit an intensity pattern more similar
to that for the chainlike polyaromatic compounds. While this
similarity is by no means a proof, a chainlike structure would
be expected for retained hydrocarbons located in the zeolite
pores, where the pore diameter is too small to accommodate
the sheetlike topology. We also note that the spectra from re-
tained hydrocarbons show subtle, but reproducible, changes

in the band positions and intensities with reaction tempera-
ture and the amount of reagent dosed into the zeolite. In the
future it may be possible to obtain a more detailed picture of
the polyaromatic hydrocarbon mixture from a larger data set
by using chemometric procedures [24,25]. Finally, the only
detectable CH stretching band is at a Raman shift character-
istic of alkyl CH. Since the CH2 scissor band at 1450 cm1,
characteristic of n-paraffins, is not observed, it appears that
the retained hydrocarbons detected by Raman spectroscopy
are alkyl polyaromatic species. This assignment is consis-
tent with the results of Schulz et al. [8,26], where primar-
ily methylated aromatics were recovered by dissolving the
coked zeolite catalyst.
None of the Raman spectra from the polyaromatic com-
pounds shown in Fig. 5 show strong bands at 1483 cm1
or 15451550 cm1, which suggests that these bands arise
from a different class of species. The Raman shifts in these
two regions are too high for CC single bonds (1060 cm1)
and too low for isolated CC double bonds (16401660cm1).
Additionally, these bands cannot be associated with CH
bending vibrations since they do not exhibit the expected
deuterium isotope shift. An examination of collections of
Raman spectroscopy data reveals a remarkable absence of
strong bands in this region of Raman shifts [27,28]. The
only plausible assignment for the band at 15451550 cm1
is the C=C double bond stretching vibration of conju-
gated olefins or polyenes [28]. The strong intensity of this
band suggests that its Raman cross section is resonance-
enhanced under 244-nm excitation. Indeed, polyenes with
4 to 10 double bonds exhibit strong optical absorption
at 244 nm [29]. In polyenes the frequency of the conju-
gated C=C stretch varies systematically with chain length
[3032]. For example, the C=C stretching frequencies for
C2H5OOC(CH=CH)nCOOC2H5 for n = 6,7,8 are 1562,
1550, and 1540 cm1, respectively [31]. A general empiri-
cal formula established by Baruya [30] indicates that a band
at 15451550 cm1 is consistent with a polyene having six
to eight double bonds. It is not clear why only this particu-
lar chain length of polyene is observed. Since polyenes with
chain lengths both shorter and longer than 68 double bonds
absorb at 244 nm, the observation of only one band does not
seem to be caused by selective resonance enhancement of the
Raman cross section. Possibly, polyenes with fewer double
bonds may not be retained by the zeolite or they may react
more quickly to form subsequent products at the tempera-
tures used in our study. Polyenes with 9 to 10 double bonds
would produce a Raman shift of 15301536 cm1, outside
the range of the measured peak position from retained hy-
drocarbons; thus it appears that polyenes larger than 6 to 8
double bonds are not formed during the MTH process. The
disappearance of the 15451550 cm1 band with increasing
methanol or dimethylether dose suggests that polyenes are
converted into aromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons.
The band at 1483 cm1 falls within a range which is
possible for polyenes with 25 double bonds. However,
the behavior of this band with reaction temperature, the
level of reagent dose where it appears, and the absence
of evidence for polyenes between 9 and 25 double bonds
are not consistent with an assignment as a polyene. The
low reaction temperatures and small reagent doses where
the 1483 cm1 band appears are conditions where shorter
polyenes should be more prevalent than longer polyenes.
Moreover, we would expect longer polyenes to be formed in
a distribution of chain lengths which would include polyenes
between 9 and 25 double bonds. Such a distribution would
produce a series of vibrational bands or a broad, indistinct
vibrational band rather than the sharp, intense band observed
in Figs. 2 and 4.
A class of compounds with a strong Raman band in
this spectral region has the five-membered aromatic ring
structure of cyclopentadiene (1500 cm1) [33,34], furan
(1490 cm1) [35,36], pyrrole (1472 cm1) [35,36], and
thiophene (1409 cm1) [36]. The band in this spectral
region has been assigned to the in-phase stretch of the
conjugated C=C bonds, which are a common structural
element in the five-membered-ring aromatic compounds
[3440]. Therefore, we assign the 1483 cm1 observed in
Figs. 2 and 4 to the in-phase stretch of the conjugated C=C
bonds in an alkylated cyclopentadienyl species.
4.2. Reaction mechanism
The literature on coke formation in acidic zeolites is
extensive, and there is general agreement on the overall
mechanism (see, for example, [41]). The current results are
most relevant to the previous work of Karge [4,12] and of
Schulz and Wei [11]. Karge identified the presence of poly-
olefin species under methanol conversion conditions using
in situ UV absorption. Schulz and Wei identified the aro-
matic products retained in the zeolite pores by liquid chro-
matography after dissolving the zeolite in hydrofluoric acid.
Based on these results Schulz and Wei proposed a mech-
anism wherein conjugated olefins undergo cyclization via
proton and hydride transfer reactions to form cyclopenta-
dienyl species which subsequently form aromatic and, ul-
timately, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (Scheme 2). The cen-
tral role of cyclopentadienyl species in coke formation at
metal sites on supported noble metal catalysts for catalytic
reforming has been known for some time (see, for example,
[4246]). The mechanism of Schulz and Wei is the first, to
our knowledge, to propose the cyclopentadienyl species as a
key intermediate for coke formation in a metal-free, zeolite
catalyst. Our results strongly support this mechanism by pro-
viding specific spectroscopic evidence for polyolefins with
chain lengths in the range from six to eight double bonds
and for a cyclopentadienyl species in the hydrocarbons re-
tained in the catalyst. To our knowledge this is the first time
the adsorbed cyclopentadienyl structure has been detected in
a heterogeneous catalyst.
Our results also suggest some additional subtleties in
the chemistry that are not captured by the mechanism of
Scheme 2. The spectra in Figs. 14 show that polyolefins,
Y.T. Chua, P.C. Stair / Journal of Catalysis 213 (2003) 3946
45
in a specific range of chain lengths, and polyaromatic
hydrocarbons are formed in the initial stages of reaction
at all three temperatures studied. Scheme 2 also seems to
require that polyolefins should all convert to polyaromatics
over time. However, since the Raman spectra do not change
with time in the absence of additional reagent, the retained
hydrocarbon species produced at a particular temperature
appear to be stable at that temperature. At the highest
reagent doses, the intensity of the band 15451550 cm1
generally decreases relative to those of the bands assigned
to polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Polyolefins may simply be
excluded as the zeolite pores are filled by polyaromatic
species.
With added reagent the 1483 cm1 band attributed to
a cyclopentadienyl species decreases relative to the bands
from polyaromatic species, presumably due to pore filling.
The cyclopentadienyl species also disappears when the tem-
perature is raised to 360 C, an indication of its thermal in-
stability. The absence of detectable cyclopentadienyl species
during methanol reaction at 200 C is not understood at this
time. This species is readily produced from dimethylether at
200 C or from methanol at 270 C, and the spectra in Fig. 3
indicate that the polyolefin precursor is present in the cata-
lyst during methanol reaction at 200 C. One possible expla-
nation is associated with the higher water content in the cat-
alyst with methanol at 200 C. If water increased the rate of
the hydride transfer step associated with the ring expansion
step in Scheme 2, then the cyclopentadienyl species may not
build up to a detectable level. Another explanation is associ-
ated with the low activity of the catalyst with methanol com-
pared to dimethylether at 200 C. The amount of retained hy-
drocarbon produced by a large dose of methanol is much less
than the amount produced by a small dose of dimethylether
as judged by the attenuation of the zeolite bands (compare
spectra 3b and 4b) and by changes in catalyst color. From
the fact that the spectra in Figs. 3 and 4 show that differ-
ent species are formed by the two reagents at 200 C, it
is also apparent that the methanol-to-dimethylether equilib-
rium was not established at this low reaction temperature.
With this explanation the formation of the cyclopentadienyl
species would depend on the concentration of hydrocarbon
species adsorbed in the zeolite, consistent with the concept
of the carbon pool mechanism for MTH put forth by Kol-
boe and Haw [4749].
The discussion so far has focused on the mechanism of
coke formation, the nonvolatile species that remained in the
zeolite. The detection of cyclopentadiene species has impli-
cations for the MTH reaction mechanism as well. As alluded
to in Scheme 1, some of the useful volatile components pro-
duced from the MTH reaction are alkylated benzenes that
are small enough to diffuse out of the zeolite pores. Haw and
co-workers have proposed that these alkylated benzenes are
produced from an alkylated cyclopentadienyl cation which
subsequently loses a proton to form alkylated cyclopenta-
diene [47]. The latter species converts to aromatic mole-
cules through a series of isomerization reactions and hy-
dride and proton transfers. The alkylated cyclopentadiene
species though not detected in the NMR experiments, is a
possible reaction intermediate according to theoretical cal-
culations [50]. The detection of cyclopentadienes in our ex-
periments supports the mechanism proposed by Haw and co-
workers.
It is interesting that the cyclopentenyl carbenium ion,
which is very prominent in the NMR measurements reported
by Haw [47], was not detected in the Raman spectra
reported here. The UV Raman spectrum of the cyclopentenyl
carbenium ion has been measured in separate experiments
reported elsewhere [51], and the signals were found to
be very weak. The absence of detectable cyclopentenyl
carbenium ion in our measurements is likely due to the small
acid site density in our H-MFI catalyst or the temperature
at which measurements were performed. The density of
carbenium ions is directly related to the acid site density
in the zeolite H-MFI. The acid site density in the H-MFI
catalyst used in our experiments is only 1/6 the density in
the zeolites used by Haw. The relative populations of neutral
diene and carbenium ion are related by the corresponding
proton transfer equilibrium. At the elevated temperatures
used in our experiments compared to Haws (200 C vs
25 C), the equilibrium population of the neutral species
may exceed that of the ion.
5. Conclusions
The formation and reaction of conjugated olefins, cy-
clopentadienyl species, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons re-
tained in zeolite H-MFI during the MTH reaction were ob-
served by UV Raman spectroscopy. Spectroscopic detection
of these species strongly supports the reaction mechanism of
Schulz and Wei as shown in Scheme 2 [11]. The pattern of
peak intensities in the spectra of the polyaromatic hydrocar-
bons suggest that these species have a chain-like topology
rather than a 2-D, sheet-like topology.
