[1] "This process is of renewed interest due to the recent boom in shale gas exploitation and the increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for the production of plastics."

[2] "Rapid deactivation is one of the disadvantages related to supported chromia catalysts. High reaction temperatures and low pressures used for the dehydrogenation reaction are optimal conditions for coke formation, which can be followed over time."

[3] "With increasing temperatures, conversion of propane increases, while selectivity towards propylene drops as cracking of reaction products becomes more prevalent."

The surge in shale gas production has renewed interest in propane dehydrogenation processes due to increased propylene demand for plastics production. Key technological advancements include the development of operando spectroscopic techniques to study catalyst behavior under realistic conditions. Current limitations involve rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation at high temperatures and low pressures. Areas for improvement include optimizing reaction conditions to balance propane conversion and propylene selectivity, as higher temperatures increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to cracking reactions. Enhancing catalyst stability and regeneration capabilities are also crucial for improving process efficiency and industrial viability.
