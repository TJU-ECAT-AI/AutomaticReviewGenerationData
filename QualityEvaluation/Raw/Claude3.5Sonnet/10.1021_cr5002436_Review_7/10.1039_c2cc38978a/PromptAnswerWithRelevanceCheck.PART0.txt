[1] "This process is of renewed interest due to the recent boom in shale gas exploitation and the increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for the production of plastics."

[2] "Rapid deactivation is one of the disadvantages related to supported chromia catalysts. High reaction temperatures and low pressures used for the dehydrogenation reaction are optimal conditions for coke formation, which can be followed over time."

[3] "With increasing temperatures, conversion of propane increases, while selectivity towards propylene drops as cracking of reaction products becomes more prevalent."

</quotes>

The recent boom in shale gas exploitation has renewed interest in propane dehydrogenation for propylene production. This is driven by increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene in plastics manufacturing. 

Key technological advancements include the development of operando spectroscopy techniques to study catalyst behavior under realistic reaction conditions. This allows monitoring of coke formation and combustion in real-time.

Current limitations of dehydrogenation processes include rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. The high temperatures and low pressures required for the reaction promote coke buildup. Additionally, increasing reaction temperature improves propane conversion but reduces propylene selectivity due to increased cracking reactions.

Areas for improvement include developing more coke-resistant catalysts, optimizing reaction conditions to balance conversion and selectivity, and implementing better process monitoring and control systems. Enhancing catalyst regeneration methods could also improve overall process efficiency and sustainability.
