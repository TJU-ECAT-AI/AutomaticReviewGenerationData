[1] "This process is of renewed interest due to the recent boom in shale gas exploitation and the increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for the production of plastics."

[2] "Rapid deactivation is one of the disadvantages related to supported chromia catalysts. High reaction temperatures and low pressures used for the dehydrogenation reaction are optimal conditions for coke formation, which can be followed over time."

[3] "With increasing temperatures, conversion of propane increases, while selectivity towards propylene drops as cracking of reaction products becomes more prevalent."

The surge in shale gas production has renewed interest in propane dehydrogenation processes due to increased availability of feedstock and growing demand for propylene relative to ethylene in plastics production. Key technological advancements include the development of operando spectroscopic techniques to monitor catalyst behavior under realistic reaction conditions.

Current limitations of dehydrogenation technologies include rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation at high temperatures and low pressures. There is also a trade-off between propane conversion and propylene selectivity at higher temperatures.

Areas for improvement include developing more coke-resistant catalysts, optimizing reaction conditions to balance conversion and selectivity, and implementing better process monitoring and control systems. Enhancing catalyst regeneration processes and extending catalyst lifetime would improve the overall efficiency and sustainability of these processes.

The industrial viability could be further improved by addressing the endothermic nature of the reaction, developing more efficient heat management strategies, and integrating the dehydrogenation process with downstream operations in a more optimized manner.

页岩气生产的激增重新引起了人们对丙烷脱氢工艺的兴趣，这是由于原料供应的增加以及塑料生产中丙烯相对于乙烯需求的增长。关键的技术进步包括开发原位光谱技术，以在实际反应条件下监测催化剂行为。

脱氢技术的当前限制包括在高温和低压下由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂快速失活。在较高温度下，丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性之间也存在权衡。

需要改进的领域包括开发更耐焦炭的催化剂，优化反应条件以平衡转化率和选择性，以及实施更好的过程监测和控制系统。改善催化剂再生过程和延长催化剂寿命将提高这些过程的整体效率和可持续性。

通过解决反应的吸热性质，开发更有效的热管理策略，以及以更优化的方式将脱氢过程与下游操作整合，可以进一步提高工业可行性。
