I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Abstract 
The dehydrogenation 
of isobutane to isobutene was conducted in a comparatively low-temperature 
range (from 623 to 723 K) 
using a hydrogen-permeable 
membrane reactor. An Al,O,-supported 
platinum catalyst exhibited high activity compared with a 
commercial CrzO,-A1z03 catalyst in a conventional flow reactor. In the membrane reactor, however, the platinum catalyst gave a 
lower yield of isobutene than the Crz03-AlzO, catalyst, although the isobutene yields on both of these catalysts were high compared 
with thermodynamic 
equilibrium values attained in a conventional reactor. The platinum catalyst deteriorated more rapidly in the 
membrane reactor, due to deposition of carbonaceous material. On the other hand, undesirable side reactions such as hydroisomer- 
ization and hydrogenolysis were suppressed in the membrane reactor due to the removal of hydrogen produced from the reaction 
side, leading to high selectivity for isobutene. The yield of isobutene in the membrane reactor increased by the addition of tin to 
Pt/AlZ03, due to the suppression of coke formation.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How have recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production, and what are the key technological advancements, current limitations, and areas for improvement that need to be addressed to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of these processes?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
