Abstract
In this communication we present experimental results showing that under certain reaction conditions the selective combustion of hydrogen
in the presence of light hydrocarbons is possible over a PtSn/SiO2 catalyst. This reaction is of importance in the development of new
dehydrogenation technology based on partial combustion of hydrogen to generate heat in situ to the endothermic dehydrogenation processes.
Both Sn/SiO2 and PtSn/SiO2 seem to be able to selectively combust hydrogen in a gas mixture with propane and oxygen, whereas Pt/SiO2
alone is less selective. If propene is added to the gas mixture, Sn/SiO2 is no longer able to selectively combust hydrogen. PtSn/SiO2, on the
other hand, can combust hydrogen with about 80% selectivity at 550 C and 90% selectivity at 500 C as long as the oxygen flow is less
than half the amount of hydrogen (stoichiometry to water formation). As soon as the oxygen flow exceeds half the amount of hydrogen, the
selectivity to COx increases at the expense of water. The results show that surface reactions are involved.

1. Introduction
The selective production of light alkenes, especially
propene, via catalytic dehydrogenation (DH), reaction (1),
is an important reaction, but the process often suffers from
poor economy. The strong endothermic character of the
equilibrium limited Eq. (1) (H= 124 kJ/mol)

(1)
demands a high reaction temperature, low pressure or strong
dilution (often with steam) to achieve high conversions. In
addition, the propanepropene separation is difficult and
energy consuming due to a small boiling-point difference,
thus making the recycling of unconverted reactant more
expensive. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) according to
Eq. (2), which is

but so far there has been no breakthrough in the search for
catalysts providing the necessary yield of propene [1]. The
main problem is the lack of selectivity due to complete com-
bustion, especially of the more reactive alkene. A recently
adapted idea as an alternative to the ODH for obtaining
olefin yields higher than equilibrium and for making the
total process heat balanced or exothermic is the selective
hydrogen combustion (SHC) according to Eq. (3) (H=
242 kJ/mol) in connection with dehydrogenation [27].

The principal idea is to supply heat by in situ combus-
tion of some of the hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation
reaction. If the process operation is adiabatic and heat bal-
anced it can be called autothermal dehydrogenation (ADH)
[3]. From the heats of reaction it is evident that about 50%
of the formed hydrogen needs to be combusted to make the
overall reaction (DH+SHC) thermoneutral. Additional ben-
efits are that the consumption of hydrogen will drive the
equilibrium towards the product side, and the steam formed
can aid in reducing coking, an important problem in cat-
alytic dehydrogenation. One proposal [3] is to use alternating
zones of dehydrogenation and selective hydrogen combus-
tion over the same catalyst. Over a Sn-Pt-Cs/ZnAl2O4 cat-

alyst at 600 C, 95% selectivity to propene was achieved at
a 38% conversion of propane [3]. Grasselli and co-workers
[57] studied the SHC over metal oxides of Bi, Bi-Mo, Sb, In
and W among other catalysts, and reported promising SHC
properties for several of the metal oxides. Among the best
catalysts for SHC are [5] Bi2O3, Bi2Mo3O12, In2Mo3O12,
Sb2O4, In2O3 and WO3. They used either alternating zones
of a Pt-Sn/ZSM-5 (DH) and the SHC catalysts or a physi-
cal mixture of the same catalysts for the total dehydrogena-
tion process, and got good selectivity towards SHC. In this
paper we will show results of experiments performed with
the aim of exploring the possibility of feeding oxygen to
a conventional catalytic dehydrogenation system, with par-
ticular emphasis on the conditions leading to the formation
of the undesired carbon oxides. We have included experi-
ments with large amounts of propene in the feed, simulating
high conversions in the DH reaction. The catalytic system
we report upon here is PtSn/SiO2. Pt is both a good catalyst
for DH, especially when promoted by Sn, and Pt is also a
known catalyst for combustion. This system is therefore an
obvious candidate to explore for the SHC reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The catalysts were prepared by aqueous incipient wet-
ness impregnation of silica (Merck Kieselgel 60, SBET =
483 m2/g, particle size 0.0630.2 mm), using SnCl2·2H2O
and H2PtCl6·6H2O. The dissolution of the tin salt was
aided by addition of HNO3. Three catalysts were used,
Sn/SiO2 (1.0 wt.% Sn), Pt/SiO2 (1.0 wt.% Pt) and PtSn/SiO2
(0.351.0 wt.%.) All reported loadings are nominal values.
The catalysts will be termed Sn, Pt and PtSn, respectively.
The catalysts were calcined at 600 C for 12 h with a ramp
rate of 5 C/min from room temperature using an airflow of
50 ml/min (GHSV = 0.30 l/g, h). The surface areas (BET)
of the catalysts were found to be: Sn/SiO2 = 457 m2/g,
Pt/SiO2 = 415 m2/g and PtSn/SiO2 = 428 m2/g.
2.2. Catalytic test
The reactions were studied in a fixed bed quartz
micro-reactor (U-shaped) with an inner diameter of 3.5 mm.
The reactions were carried out at atmospheric pressure us-
ing air as the oxidant. The catalyst loading was 0.3 g for all
experiments. The reactor was placed in an electrical furnace,
and the temperature controlled using external and internal
thermocouples in the range from ambient to 775 C. The
total flow rate was 100 ml/min with varying compositions of
propane, air, propene, hydrogen, the balance being helium.
Gases were premixed and fed to the reactor using electronic
mass flow controllers (Bronkhurst). The product gas was
analysed for hydrocarbons (C1C4) and for permanent gases
(O2, N2, CO, CO2) by GC. The catalyst was pre-reduced for
2 h with hydrogen (15 ml/min) at 500 C using a heating rate
of 10 C/min. The chromatograph used was a Perkin-Elmer
autosystem XL equipped with a TCD (Carbosieve SII, 10 ft,
80 mesh), and a FID (PoraPLOT Q, 27.5 m, i.d., 0.53 mm).
From the composition data the fractional conversion of
propane and oxygen was calculated. The selectivities were
calculated based on moles propane converted to CO/CO2
(C-selectivity) or number of moles dioxygen converted to
CO/CO2 or H2O (O-selectivity). Water and hydrogen in the
exit gas was not analysed by the GC, but the amounts were
calculated through mass balances.
3. Results
There was no significant conversion of propane at temper-
atures below 600 C for the empty reactor using a gas mix-
ture of propane (10%), oxygen (2%) and hydrogen (2%). A
gradual increase of the oxygen conversion was observed as
the temperature increased from 30 C, and at 550 C the con-
version was about 10%. The conversion of propane is in rea-
sonable agreement with what was observed by Beretta et al.
[8,9]. However, Burch and Crabb [10] observed propane
conversion in an empty reactor already at 550 C. The dif-
ference could be due to the different gas composition in
our experiments, the main difference being that we had a
co-injection of hydrogen in the feed.
The results using the silica support as catalyst was about
the same as observed for the empty reactor at 500 C, 37%
conversion of oxygen and total conversion to water.
Fig. 1 shows typical developments of the activity in
propane dehydrogenation over the platinum-based catalysts
with respect to time. In Fig. 1a the catalytic stability of
the PtSn is shown for the different gas mixtures (propane,
propane/H2, propane/O2 and propane/H2/O2). The propane
conversion is lower with oxygen present in the feed than
the case is for the gas mixtures without oxygen, but with
oxygen the catalyst is more stable. The reason for this
could be that oxygen (or the water formed in the reaction)
continuously removes coke or coke precursors deposited
on the catalyst. Co-fed hydrogen also seems to stabilise
the catalytic activity to some extent. When only propane
is present in the feed, the initial conversion is higher, but
the drop in activity over the first few hours on-stream is
pronounced. In Fig. 1b the catalytic stability of the Pt is
shown for the same gas mixtures. The unpromoted Pt is
more active initially, but deactivates faster compared to
the PtSn catalyst, as observed previously in the conven-
tional dehydrogenation system [11]. Here the same effect
is shown also in the presence of O2. Sn appears to have a
stabilising effect on the activity of the catalyst, irrespective
of the gas composition. This could be due to a selective
poisoning of the most active Pt-sites, or a dilution effect
as discussed earlier for the conventional dehydrogenation
reaction [11]. In the experiment with propane and H2, the
Pt shows a much higher activity than the case is for the

other gas compositions. The H2 addition again enhances the
activity of this catalyst, indicating that rapid initial coking
is the main cause of the deactivation of the Pt catalyst. This
was not the case for the PtSn catalyst, which is in line with
our previous observation [11]. Sn alone is not active for the
dehydrogenation or combustion of hydrocarbons at these
conditions. At 500 C the conversion is very low, and at
550 C the conversion of propane is less than 1% when the
1% Sn/SiO2 is used as a catalyst (data not shown).
Fig. 2 provides a summary of results obtained at 550 C
over the different catalysts when increasing amounts of oxy-
gen were added to a propane/hydrogen feed. The experi-
ments were conducted with a small amount (2.0 ml/min) of
gaseous H2 in the reactor feed gas to reduce the deactivation
and to study the reaction pathway of oxygen in the system.
From Fig. 2a it is evident that the O2 conversion is high, but
not complete for all cases for Pt and PtSn. There is some
unconverted oxygen, in the range 46% of the oxygen fed to
the reactor, and this number is constant, independent of the
feed rate and catalyst. This could indicate a by-pass of some
of the reactant gas through the catalyst bed, or as indicated
by Beretta et al. [8], that the oxygen conversion is limited by
diffusion (although their results were obtained in an annular
reactor with much higher flow rates). The Sn catalyst was
less active for oxygen conversion at high oxygen concen-
trations. Here the conversion is above 95% until the oxygen
flow exceeds 1 ml/min, but at 1.5 ml O2/min the conversion
of oxygen has dropped to 82%. The excess oxygen reacts
slowly with propane over the Sn catalyst and therefore the
conversion of oxygen is incomplete when all the hydrogen is

consumed. The empty reactor gave only a low oxygen con-
version at the same conditions (<10%). Fig. 2b shows the
propane conversion over the same three catalytic systems.
The propane conversion initially increases when oxygen is
introduced to the PtSn system. The main product is propene
from dehydrogenation. This is followed by a drop in the
conversion from 5.6% at an oxygen content of 0.5 ml/min
to a conversion of 4.0% at an oxygen flow of 1.5 ml/min.
When the oxygen feed rate exceeds 1.5 ml/min, the propane
conversion increases again. For Pt there is no such initial
increase in conversion of propane when oxygen is intro-
duced, but the same decrease in propane conversion as for
PtSn is observed as the oxygen flow approaches 1 ml/min.
This apparently complex relationship is probably the sum of
the two main reactions: The drop in the propane conversion
initially could be explained by deactivation of the catalyst,
since the experimental points were recorded with increasing
time on stream. But this could also be a kinetic effect on
the dehydrogenation reaction linked to the partial pressure
of oxygen or the water formed. This is however less likely
since the trend is different for PtSn. If the oxygen flow is
further increased (above 1 ml/min) the propane conversion
rises again. This is due to a steep increase in the forma-
tion rate of CO2, and the sum of these reactions gives the
observed overall consumption of propane. Sn is not a very
active catalyst for converting propane, only about 0.5% (or
less) of the propane is converted at oxygen flows lower than
1 ml/min. The selectivity to propene over PtSn (Fig. 2c) is
almost complete up to 1 ml/min of O2 in the feed gas, above
this amount the carbon selectivity drops due to the forma-

tion of CO and CO2. Pt shows lower selectivity to propene
than PtSn, and at a flow rate of 1 ml/min oxygen, the selec-
tivity to propene is only 60% compared to almost 100% for
PtSn. For Sn, the main product is propene, but significant
amounts of cracking products are observed for this catalyst.
In Fig. 2d a selectivity to C1 and C2 products as high as
20% at stoichiometric (1 ml/min) amounts of oxygen is ev-
ident, but the formation rate of cracking products is rather
low since the activity of Sn for the conversion of propane is
below 1%. The cracking selectivity is low over Pt and PtSn.
The promotion by Sn leads to a lowering of the cracking
selectivity at low O2 flows (DH-conditions), but when the
flow exceeds 1 ml/min the curves merge. Fig. 2e shows the
selectivities to H2O as a function of oxygen flow. Both PtSn
and Sn show excellent properties towards producing water
from hydrogen and oxygen without producing any COx, giv-
ing close to 100% selectivity to water as long as the oxygen
flow is below 1 ml/min. Pt, on the other hand, is a less se-
lective catalyst for water formation; at 1 ml/min oxygen the
selectivity to water is only about 60%.
Fig. 3 shows the carbon and oxygen selectivities to CO2
and CO for the same experiments as described in Fig. 2.
In line with the results shown above, the figure shows that
no COx is formed for oxygen flow rates below 1 ml/min for
PtSn and Sn catalysts. It can again be noted that an oxygen
flow of 1 ml/min corresponds to the stoichiometry of the
H2O2 reaction with the H2 added to the feed. The results
confirm that as long as the O2 is fed to the reactor at a
less than stoichiometric amount compared to the molecular
hydrogen in the feed according to reaction (3), the O2 reacts
selectively with hydrogen to form water. When the oxygen
flow is increased further above 1 ml/min, CO and CO2 are
formed in increasing amounts and this eventually becomes
the major reaction pathway. The results show that O2 reacts
selectively with hydrogen under certain conditions, i.e. when
hydrogen is in excess compared to oxygen. As soon as the
surplus hydrogen is reacted, the excess O2 will react with
hydrocarbons in a non-selective manner leading to CO/CO2,
with a simultaneous drop in the selectivity to propene. The
results in Fig. 3 ad also demonstrate that Pt does not show
the same effect concerning selective hydrogen combustion.
Already at oxygen flows of 0.5 ml/min significant amounts of
CO2 and CO are produced. The main product is always CO2.
Over Pt the CO-selectivity drops off with increasing O2 flow,
whereas for Sn and PtSn the trend is opposite. This could
indicate a higher activity in the CO oxidation reaction over
Pt, especially since the CO-selectivity drops when excess
O2 is fed to the reactor (O2 flows above 1 ml/min).
Figs. 4 and 5 (550 and 500 C) show results obtained using
a gas mixture containing a large fraction of propene, thus
simulating a high conversion in the DH reaction. The gas
contained propane, propene and hydrogen in a ratio close to
fulfilling the equilibrium criterion, to avoid any interchange
of propane and propene due to hydrogenation of propene.
The flow rate of oxygen was varied from 0 to 4 ml/min.
Figs. 4a and Fig. 5a show that the oxygen conversion is
high at all conditions and similar for all the catalysts. The
exception is for oxygen flows above 1 ml/min over Sn at
500 C, where the conversion dropped to about 90%. This
shows that Sn as expected is less active for hydrocarbon

activation, as previously discussed for the system without
propene in the feed. The oxygen conversions were slightly
higher for the propene-rich mixtures than for the system of
propane, hydrogen and oxygen. However, also in this case
(for all catalysts) is there some unconverted oxygen, in the
range 46% of the oxygen fed to the reactor. Again, this
could indicate a by-pass of some of the reactant gas through
the catalyst bed, or that the oxygen conversion is limited by
diffusion [8]. Figs. 4b and 5b show the oxygen-selectivity to
water formation. The main difference from the experiments
with propane as the only hydrocarbon is that 100% selectiv-
ity to water no longer is observed. At low oxygen flows (less
than 1 ml/min), a close to 80% selectivity to water is ob-
served over PtSn at 550 C. A 90% selectivity to water is ob-
served at 500 C over the same catalyst. At low oxygen flows
the selectivity decreases in the order PtSn > Pt > Sn for
both temperatures. The selectivity to water falls dramatically
when the oxygen flow is increased. The difference between
Pt and PtSn remains constant throughout, whereas for the Sn
catalyst the drop in selectivity is less severe. Above 2 ml/min
O2 feed rate the selectivity to water is in the range 4050%
at 550 C and slightly higher at 500 C, which indicates that
the hydrocarbons are being combusted, e.g. C3H6 combus-
tion would give a H2O-selectivity (based on consumed O2)
of 33%. Figs. 4c, d and 5c, d show the selectivities to CO2
and CO at 550 and 500 C, respectively. The main product
is always CO2. As the case was for the experiments with-
out propene in the feed (Fig. 3), the CO-selectivity drops off
with increasing O2 flow over Pt, whereas for Sn and PtSn the
trend is opposite. This could again indicate a higher activity
in the CO oxidation reaction over Pt also at these conditions.
Due to the composition of the feed gas the main dehy-
drogenation reaction (1) is close to equilibrium, and there
should be no propane to propene interconversion. However,
due to side-reactions, mainly cracking/hydrogenolysis type
reactions, and possibly also due to different reactivities to-
wards oxygen, the hydrocarbon composition is somewhat
changed at the reactor outlet. Table 1 shows the product dis-
tribution of C1 and C2 products for the different catalysts
at 550 and 500 C. There was no clear trend in the crack-
ing product distribution. It could however be observed over
both Sn and PtSn that the selectivity to methane in most

cases was lower than what would be expected if the C2
products were formed by a simple CC bond scission (ex-
pected C-selectivity SCH4:SC2H4 = 1:2). A possible expla-
nation is that the hydrocarbon adsorption involves a CC
bond scission. The adsorbed C1 species is oxidised to carbon
oxides, leaving a C2-unit as a hydrocarbon product. Since
methane is the most stable hydrocarbon, it is clear that the
C1 species can not desorb as methane, but has to react di-
rectly (from an adsorbed state) after the CC bond cleavage
of the propane/propene. On the other hand, the selectivity to
methane over the Pt catalyst at 550 C is higher than what
would be expected from a single CC bond cleavage, which
is the opposite trend from Sn and PtSn. This could indi-
cate multiple cracking events, or that ethene formed in the
cracking reaction is further oxidised to COx.
4. Discussion
The main finding reported here is that under certain con-
ditions, when the amount of oxygen in the feed is limited to
less than the amount necessary for the stoichiometric reac-
tion with the available hydrogen, a selective hydrogen com-
bustion is possible, even with high concentrations of propene
present in the gas. The results are dependent on the catalyst,
confirming that surface catalyzed reactions are involved. The
results show that a metallic catalyst system like supported
PtSn can provide a similar effect as the oxide catalysts de-
scribed earlier [57]. The mechanisms involved, especially
the explanation as to why PtSn (and to a certain extent Sn)
gives higher selectivity to water compared to Pt, are how-
ever not clear.
In conventional dehydrogenation there are two side-
reactions that compete with dehydrogenation; hydrogenol-
ysis and coke formation [12]. The addition of Sn improves
the properties of the Pt catalyst, but the mechanism depends
on the interaction with the support. We have previously
shown that Pt in the PtSn/SiO2 system has a low support
interaction, and has properties (in catalytic dehydrogena-
tion) that can be explained by PtSn alloy formation. In the
alloy, the surface properties of Pt are changed. The Pt sur-
face is diluted, giving small ensembles of Pt, with different
electronic properties than pure Pt particles. This leads to
a more stable catalyst, but these effects also give a lower
activity for dehydrogenation of propane, probably due to
a weaker adsorption of propane [11]. Based on this it is
possible to speculate that the PtSn/SiO2 system used here
has adsorption properties favouring hydrogen adsorption
in competition with hydrocarbons, and thereby promoting
subsequent reaction with adsorbed oxygen.
However, there is also some activity and selectivity for
the desired SHC reaction over pure Sn catalyst. The conver-
sion of alkanes is low over pure Sn, which confirms that Sn
does not adsorb alkanes to any significant degree. Since the
selectivity to hydrogen combustion is high, we propose that
Sn also activates hydrogen. If only oxygen is adsorbed on
the surface (i.e. an Eley-Rideal mechanism) it is difficult to
envisage a high selectivity towards SHC, since the probabil-
ity for collision from the gas phase must be similar for the
fuel molecules. This would also hold true for other oxidic
SHC catalysts.
On the other hand, unpromoted Pt gives high conver-
sions of alkanes, hydrogen and oxygen, especially in the
initial parts of the experiments. The conversion of the hy-
drocarbons over Pt drops off as a function of time, prob-
ably due to coke formation. This could be linked with a
stronger hydrocarbon adsorption on pure Pt, which also
can explain the lower selectivity to the desired SHC re-
action. When a hydrocarbon molecule approaches the cat-
alyst surface of the pure Pt, it adsorbs dissociatively to
an allylic species which can desorb to produce an alkene.
With oxygen present, either from the surface or from the
gas phase, the adsorbed intermediate is oxidized to COx.
When Sn is added to the Pt catalyst, the adsorption prop-
erties are changed so that hydrogen adsorption and activa-
tion is favoured compared to hydrocarbon adsorption and
oxidation.
5. Summary and conclusions
The results show that under certain reaction conditions
and in an excess of hydrogen the selective combustion of hy-
drogen in the presence of light hydrocarbons over Pt-based
catalysts is possible. Sn has a stabilising effect on the cata-
lyst activity, PtSn being more stabile than Pt. Both Sn and
PtSn seem to be able to selectively combust hydrogen in
a gas mixture with propane and oxygen. Pt does not show
this quality. If propene is added to the gas mixture, Sn is no
longer able to selectively combust hydrogen. PtSn, on the
other hand, combusts hydrogen with about 80% selectivity
at 550 C and 90% selectivity at 500 C as long as the oxy-
gen flow is less than half the amount of hydrogen. As soon
as the oxygen flow exceeds half the amount of hydrogen,
the selectivity to COx increases at the expense of water. The
mechanisms involved are not clear but probably involve ad-
sorbed species.
