Abstract
Catalytic propane dehydrogenation has been tested on different reactor configurations employing PtSn/MgAl2O4 as a catalyst. Hollow fiber palladium membranes coupled to the two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR) combine the possibility of improving propane conversion by hydrogen removal from the reaction bed through the membrane with in situ catalyst regeneration in the lower section of the TZFBR. Experiments have been carried out at different reaction temperatures and time on stream. In addition, the optimum regenerative agent flow fraction (diluted oxygen) to be fed into the TZFBR has been determined at the reaction temperatures between 500 C and 600 C to get a constant catalytic activity without net deactivation. Moreover, the TZFBR with palladium membranes has been successfully tested, displacing the reaction equilibrium towards the production of propylene, and still keeping steady state in the catalytic propane dehydrogenation. These results were better than those reported in the literature for conventional reactors.

1 Introduction
Membrane reactors are among the technologies in the frame of chemical process intensification. This kind of system enables a chemical reaction (oxidative reforming, steam reforming, etc.) to be performed in a single unit and product separation through a membrane. (1) In this case, membranes are not only considered as separators but also have a direct influence on the chemical reaction. (2-4) Main limitations of these reactors are related to the adaptation between the membrane and the reactor as well as chemical and physical membrane resistance. Membranes employed in these reactors are classified in two generic types according to its composition: organic and inorganic membranes. Inorganic membranes represent the most studied ones in catalytic processes since organic membranes are not able to work at harsh conditions. Inorganic membranes usually have a high thermal stability and high chemical and physical resistance, which allow them to work at high temperatures. (5) Membrane reactors are, then, commonly employed to carry out chemical reactions limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium or reactions with low kinetic rates. (6, 7) In fact, membrane separation capability is used to improve catalytic processes in two ways: by providing a selective product separation (extractive application) or by adding a reactant selectively (distributive application). (8) The removal of one of the main reaction products, in reactions limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium, modifies this equilibrium towards the products production.
Among the inorganic membranes, Pd-based dense membranes are the most employed ones in membrane reactors for hydrogen production. (9) Their ability to selectively remove high-purity hydrogen makes the Pd membrane interesting to be used in such reactions limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium, increasing their conversion and yield, thanks to the reaction displacement to more product formation. However, the high membrane cost represents an important limitation to implant it in industrial processes. The high price of both substrates and Pd, $27.5/g ($780/oz), is the bottleneck in employing membrane reactors for large-scale or distributed applications. Nevertheless, substrates are significantly more expensive than Pd; for example, medium quality porous stainless steel supports (PSS) are expensive, i.e. $100 per tube with dimensions of OD = 1 in. (2.54 cm) and L = 6 in.(15.24 cm), which is around 70% of the total price of the system since the Pd cost for a 5 μm Pd membrane over these PSS is about $20. (10) Another important process limitation is that the selective H2 removal increases the coke formation in catalytic hydrocarbon conversion at high temperature. Therefore, the H2 removal leads to a faster catalyst deactivation, being an important problem because it implies a catalyst deactivation with a critical yield process decrease. (11, 12)
Currently, most propylene is obtained as ethylene byproduct. The propylene consumption is increasing faster than ethylene consumption; therefore, new ways to produce propylene must be developed. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation is one of the most promising paths to produce propylene. This process implies an endothermic reaction (ΔH298K = 124 kJ/mol) limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium (13) where hydrogen is one of the reaction products (eq 1). According to its characteristics, this catalytic propane dehydrogenation is a suitable heterogeneous catalytic reaction where a membrane reactor can be implemented. This catalytic process is generally carried out with chromium (14, 15) or platinum (16) catalysts supported on alumina at 500600 C at atmospheric pressure. Different systems and catalyst modifications have been studied by several authors, who found important process limitations. (17, 18) One of them is the presence of undesired secondary reactions (eqs 2 and 3) that cause selectivity loss. Another important limitation is the coke formation reaction (eq 4).

This coke is deposited over the catalyst surface, inhibiting its activity and producing a severe and continuous yield decrease. However, the catalytic propane dehydrogenation is an already implemented process at industrial scale. As an example, BASF built a 350 kt/year plant in Tarragona (Spain) in 2004 based on the Oleflex process. In addition, the rise of shale gas has favored the use of propane as raw material, and several companies (Dow, Formosa Plastics, Enterprise Products) have announced new plants for 600700 kt/year each. (19) The process limitations are currently faced by employing serial systems where catalytic reaction and catalyst regeneration take place in different batch reactors that provide a semicontinuous propylene production. Other industrial configurations consist of supplying hydrogen with propane feed with an aim of reducing coke formation in reaction but reaching lower yield to propylene. In the past few years, some authors tested catalysts based on gallium species (20) and several promoters such as Ce, K, La, or Na (16, 21-23) to reduce the coke formation. Supports based on zeolites have also been used in catalytic propane dehydrogenation. (24)
The use of a two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR) has been proposed to carry out continuous catalyst regeneration (Figure 1). The TZFBR has been tested in several catalytic dehydrogenations, such as propane and butane catalytic dehydrogenation employing different catalysts, as well as other kinds of applications. (17, 25, 26) This novel reactor represents a useful system to be applied for such heterogeneous catalytic processes where the catalyst is deactivated by coke deposition or even for a red-ox process. The reactor configuration consists of two gas feed points that generate two different atmospheres inside the reactor. A reactive agent, e.g. propane, is fed at an intermediate point of a fluidized bed, creating the reaction zone in the upper part of the bed. Simultaneously an oxidant agent, e.g. diluted oxygen, is fed at the bottom of the bed, creating the regeneration zone. The characteristic bubbling regime in fluidized bed reactors provides the catalyst circulation between both zones. Therefore, the catalyst, which is deactivated by coke deposition in the reaction zone, flows down to the regeneration zone where coke combustion takes place. Due to the bed fluidization, the regenerated catalyst comes up to the reaction zone and it may react again with the same activity, resulting in a steady state system in only one unit. (27) To achieve a maximum yield at steady state, the TZFBR needs an exhaustive optimization of its operational conditions. On one hand, the system has to be operated in such conditions that the oxidizing agent does not reach the upper zone and does not interact with the reactive gas, avoiding an important selectivity loss. On the other hand, if the oxidant flow fed is lower than the optimum required, catalysts will not be completely regenerated, and coke would be accumulated over the catalyst surface leading to an important activity process decrease.

Palladium membranes coupled to the TZFBR represents a multifunctional membrane reactor for the catalytic propane dehydrogenation. The TZFBR could provide a constant process activity, whereas the dense Pd membrane could enhance the process yield to propylene via H2 removal. To reduce membrane costs, a thin palladium layer can be supported over porous alumina hollow fibers showing the highest surface area/volume value in selective-hydrogen-removal membranes. In addition, the fabrication process of asymmetric ceramic composite tubes is expensive due to the multiple fabrication steps. However, a more economical fabrication process can be achieved by using a phase inversion technique, in which the multiple fabrication steps are combined into a single step. As already discussed, the hydrogen removal through these membranes increases the catalyst deactivation rate by coke deposition, but the TZFBR could solve this limitation thanks to continuous catalyst regeneration. Although the use of membranes in fluidized bed reactors, as a way to increase the conversion, has been described by several groups, (28, 29) the combination of reaction, regeneration, and separation in a single unit is highly novel. In a previous study, (11) catalytic propane dehydrogenation was tested in the TZFBR with a palladium membrane employing a PtSnK/γAl2O3 catalyst. That study showed that the coke formation was higher than expected at working experimental conditions and good results could not be obtained, which suggested the use of other kind of catalysts with a lower trend to coke formation.
In the present study a PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst has been tested in the TZFBR with a hollow fiber palladium membrane. This catalyst shows low coke deposition because of the low support acidity and an improved yield to olefins in previously tested dehydrogenation reactions, e.g. n-butane dehydrogenation. (30) With this catalyst, cracking and coking reactions are hindered. Therefore, the oxidant requirements in the TZFBR will be lower, providing high propylene selectivity. By this way, the limitation found in the previous study could be solved. In this study, a novel two-section TZFBR configuration (TS-TZFBR) has been employed (Figure 2). Different bed sections between both reactor zones have been implemented to allow a better control of the fluid-dynamic regime in each reactor zone, allowing low regenerating flows when required. (31, 32) In the present work, the catalytic propane dehydrogenation is going to be tested for the propylene production on a TS-TZFBR with coupled dense Pd membrane. This multifunctional reactor could provide very important process intensification, where three different operations could take place: reaction, regeneration, and molecular separation. To illustrate the process improvement, the catalytic propane dehydrogenation has been carried out in different reactor configurations: traditional fluidized bed reactor (FBR), TZFBR, and the proposed coupled TS-TZFBR with palladium membrane.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
PtSn/MgAl2O4 was prepared by incipient impregnation of platinum and tin compounds after synthesizing the catalytic support by a solgel method. (30) First of all, magnesium (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Aldrich, 99%) and aluminum (Al(NO3)3·9H2O, Aldrich, 99%) compounds were dissolved and reaction took place at 50 C and pH 9, maintaining a vigorous stirring during 1 h. After that, the white-gel MgAl2O4 formed was precipitated and aged at atmospheric conditions for 8 h. Next, the white-gel was filtrated and neutralized in a vacuum system and dried at 120 C all night. Finally, it was calcined with the following steps: the gel was first heated at 350 C for 2 h and then at 800 C for 8 h. Before impregnating the catalyst, the obtained catalytic support was sieved to 75150 μm particle size. Once sieved, the MgAl2O4 particles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) techniques in order to analyze their structure, specific external surface, and pore size distribution.
In the second part of catalyst preparation, the support was coated by tin and platinum precursors (SnCl2, Aldrich, 98% and H2PtCl6, Aldrich, 8% dissolution in water) following an incipient impregnation method in two consecutive steps. First, tin is impregnated over the support for 6 h and dried at 120 C for the whole night. After that, platinum is impregnated in the same way. Finally, the catalyst was calcined in air at 650 C for 3 h (2 C/min heating rate) and sieved, again, to 75150 μm particle size.
Before proceeding with the experimental analysis, the PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst has been further characterized by determining its minimum fluidization velocity, umf. The minimum fluidization velocity test was carried out with Ar at 550 C in a traditional fluidized bed reactor, obtaining umf = 0.53 cm/s (i.e., 0.175 cm3 STP/cm2·s.).
Besides, several stabilization cycles (reduction, reaction, and regeneration of the fresh catalyst) have been performed to ensure the reproducibility of the PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalytic activity. These cycles have been carried out in a traditional fluidized bed reactor configuration at 550 C using reactive gas diluted in Ar. In a cycle, the volumetric percentage of reactive gas used was 25% hydrogen, 50% propane, and 5% oxygen for reduction, reaction, and regeneration steps, respectively.
2.2 Membrane Preparation
Palladium membranes have been developed by a direct deposition on a porous alumina hollow fiber. This support consists of a unique asymmetric alumina structure which was prepared via phase-inversion/sintering technique. (33) The preparation of the spinning suspension was previously described elsewhere. (13) After 2 h degassing under vacuum, the suspension was pressurized at 50140 kPag (720 psig) using nitrogen and extruded through a tube in orifice spinneret with 1.2 mm inner diameter and 3.0 mm outer diameter. Fibers were coagulated by deionized water after extruding and sintered to obtain the final hollow fiber in a three-step process. First, fibers are heated at 600 C during 2 h with 2 C/min heating rate, then heated at 1000 C during 2 h with a 5 C/min heating rate, and finally, fibers were sintered during 4 h at 1450 C. One side of the final hollow fiber is then sealed with glaze, whereas the other end remains opened. Moreover, the external hollow fiber surface was also sealed with glaze excepting the last 6 cm close to the sealed end where palladium will be coated.
Palladium deposition on the asymmetric hollow fiber was carried out by an electroless plating process. (34) Before coating, the hollow fiber surface was cleaned using deionized water and activated by six consecutive immersions in tin chloride (SnCl2HCl, 1 g/L, pH 2)) and palladium chloride (PdCl2HCl, 1 g/L, pH 2) solutions at atmospheric temperature. As a result, the surface color of the Al2O3 hollow fiber changed from white to dark brown. The aim of this process was to enhance the uniformity of palladium coating. Between each immersion, the support was cleaned with 0.1 M HCl. Finally, the hollow fiber surface was coated in the palladium bath (Table 1). The Pd membranes were dried in an oven at 120 C for 2 h. The uniformity of the Pd coating was checked by SEM images at different positions.

2.3 Reaction
Catalytic propane dehydrogenation has been tested with three different reactors: a traditional fluidized bed reactor (FBR), a TZFBR, and a TZFBR with palladium membrane. The FBR consisted of a 3 cm inner diameter quartz column, where the reactive propane flow was fed at the bottom inlet of the reactor. The TZFBR with membrane configuration is shown in the Figure 2. It consisted of a quartz column with a variable cross-sectional area between the regeneration and the reaction zones. The lower and the upper reactor cross sections were 1.8 and 3 cm inner diameter, respectively, and the transition region between them formed a 60 angle with respect to the horizontal position. This configuration improves the control of the fluid dynamic regime in both reactor regions separately, with respect to the original straight-column TZFBR (Figure 1). (25, 31) The oxidizer agent, i.e. diluted oxygen, enters the bed through a bottom porous quartz plate distributor. This porous plate acts as catalyst bed support as well. The reactive gas, i.e. propane, was fed through an immersed four-orifices gas distributor (4 mm external diameter), which was located at an intermediate point of the transition bed section. A palladium membrane, located within the reactive bed section, is placed inside a porous ceramic (2 μm pore size) α-alumina tubular membrane with 8 mm inner diameter. The use of an external shell provided better mechanical resistance to the palladium membrane and avoids erosive effects on the thin Pd layer due to catalyst particles circulation in the fluidized bed. Both the propane distributor and the Pd membrane were connected to the reactor top.
Before reaction begins, the catalytic bed was heated to reaction temperature at 2 C/min heating rate to avoid membrane damages and is activated (reducing PtO species to Pt0) at 550 C with hydrogen according to the conditions shown in Table 2. A series of experiments has been performed to evaluate the effect of the reaction temperature and the optimum percentage of oxygen in the regeneration flow in order to achieve a constant catalytic activity. For this purpose, the catalytic propane dehydrogenation was carried out at different temperatures between 500 and 600 C with 72 g of catalyst in each case. After each reactive experiment, the catalyst was fully regenerated with an oxygen flow at 550 C until no-CO and no-CO2 signal was detected by online gas chromatography. Table 3 shows the working conditions for each experimental series.

Each reactive gas flow was controlled by a set of digital mass flow controllers. The furnace temperature control was carried out by an immersed thermocouple (Controller 3116, Eurotherm). Reaction gas products were analyzed by online gas chromatography (μGC-R3000, SRA Instruments), and a vacuum pump (2P-3, Start) is employed to generate the pressure drop (driving force) between both membrane sides for the hydrogen permeation.
2.4 Materials Characterization
XRD data were obtained at 298 K in a D-Max Rigaku difractometer with a mobile anode. The difractometer works at 40 kV and 80 mA with a Cu anode and graphite monochromator to select CuKα1.2 radiation. Experimental measurements have been carried out varying the diffraction angle between 10 and 90 with a 0.03 step.
The BET specific surface of the catalyst has been obtained in a Micrometrics ASAP 2020.
Permeation tests across the Pd membranes were carried out at different temperatures. For this purpose, the Pd membrane was assembled in the reactor shown in Figure 2, but working without the catalytic bed and with the propane inlet pipe previously sealed. A constant flow rate of pure Ar or H2 + Ar was fed at the bottom inlet of the reactor using digital mass flow controllers. Then, a pressure drop across the membrane was established with the vacuum pump in the hydrogen exit pipe. Subsequently the nonpermeated flow was measured at the products exit pipe of the reactor using a flow meter at atmospheric pressure. Several gas flow rates with different H2/Ar ratios were tested.
3 Results
The results of solid characterization tests have shown that MgAl2O4 was correctly synthesized. Different X-ray diffraction peaks (Figure 3a) agree with the structural geometry of the MgAl2O4 spinel. The adsorption isotherm (Figure 3b) shows a typical type-4 adsorption curve, which is characteristic of mesoporous solids. From the BJH analysis an average pore size of 7.2 nm was obtained. The BET area was 123 m2/g, and the pore volume 0.26 cm3/g.

Figure 4 shows an example of how catalytic activity achieves a reproducible behavior after several reductionreactionregeneration cycles in a FBR at 550 C with the conditions shown in Table 2. For the experimental conditions used in the study reported in the Figure 4, it can be seen that both curves of propane conversion (XC3H8) and curves of selectivity to propylene (SC3H6), were reproducible from the sixth cycle (n = 6) onward. It seems that in the first reductionreactionregeneration cycles those active sites with more tendency to coke formation are transformed into weaker active sites, thus reducing the overall tendency to coke formation and improving the propylene selectivity. Accordingly, for further reaction studies a solid with n  6, i.e. a stabilized catalyst, was always used to load the reactor schematized in Figure 2.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Propane conversion and selectivity to propylene after n stabilization (reduction + reaction + regeneration) cycles of the fresh PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst. T = 550 C.
A first study was carried out in the FBR configuration in order to evaluate the reaction temperature influence on the catalyst deactivation and on the evolution of the yield to propylene, the product of interest. The propane conversion obtained (Figure 5) was higher when reaction temperature increased, due to the endothermic character of the dehydrogenation reaction. However, the selectivity to propylene decreases at higher temperatures because of the presence of competitive cracking and coke-formation reactions. Moreover, it can be observed how it was impossible to reach a steady state operation with a constant catalytic activity in this kind of traditional fluidized bed reactor. In this case, the process yield to propylene decreased along the time on stream. As a conclusion, the catalyst must be regenerated after only 1 h of chemical reaction time in order not to lose catalytic activity due to coke deposition.

As can be observed in Figure 5, the higher the reaction temperature, the faster the catalyst deactivation and the sharper the propane conversion decrease. This deactivation rate can be measured by the rate of the conversion change (dX/dt) for each reaction temperature (Figure 6). According to the results presented in Figure 6, the deactivation rate increases exponentially with the reaction temperature. Back to Figure 5, it can be observed how the selectivity to propylene increases quickly during the first reaction minutes. The explanation is that when reaction begins, propane reacts with fully active catalytic particles. It leads to massive coke generation (higher at higher temperatures). After a few reaction minutes, the catalyst active sites are partially covered by coke, and the coke deposition rate decreases. For this reason, the selectivity to propylene tends to increase in such deactivation conditions.

As a solution to counteract the catalyst deactivation, the TZFBR may provide steady state operation with a constant activity for catalytic propane dehydrogenation. It can be done by adjusting the amount of oxygen to be introduced through the regeneration bed section in order to burn the coke formed within the reaction zone. On the one hand, if the oxygen feed in the regeneration zone is too low, the rate of coke removal would be lower than the rate of coke formation, and the catalyst will be deactivated or will achieve a steady state with low activity. On the other hand, if the oxygen feed is too high, some oxygen could reach the reaction zone. It would lead to undesirable propane combustion and would entail an important propylene selectivity decrease. In this scenario, the catalyst could be overoxidized because of the lower hydrogen production that would impede the catalyst active sites reduction. Thus, the catalyst would be kept deactivated. Figure 7 shows several experiments performed at the same temperature T = 550 C with different oxygen percentage fed on the regeneration zone (relative to the total gas feed into the reactor, i.e. reaction plus regeneration zones). In case of adding a 3% of oxygen, it allows constant yield to propylene along the reaction time-on-stream, indicating the optimum value of oxidant reactive to be fed into the TZFBR. Figure 8 shows the optimum oxygen inlet percentage on the regeneration zone at different reaction temperatures after analyzing the yield to propylene at several oxygen percentages at each reaction temperature. This figure represents the rate of propylene yield decrease (dY/dt) for several oxygen percentages at each temperature. In this case, the higher the reaction temperature, the higher the need of regenerative oxygen supply. This result can be explained by the fact that high temperatures favor secondary reactions like thermal cracking and coke formation. Consequently the higher the temperature, the faster the deactivation (see Figure 6, or data corresponding to a value of 0% O2 inlet in Figure 8). The optimum oxygen percentage at different reaction temperatures has been plotted in Figure 6, showing that there is a logical correlation between the degree of deactivation in FBR configuration and the requirement of oxidant gas supply to continuously regenerate the catalyst in TZFBR configuration. The energy balances at adiabatic conditions for the TZFBR system working with the optimum oxygen percentage reveal autothermal functioning of the process when the temperature is about 550 C (3% O2) or higher (>3% O2). This implies that in such conditions the amount of coke combustion is sufficient to supply the energy for the endothermic propane dehydrogenation.

After determining the optimum oxygen flows in each case, several experiments at different reaction temperatures were carried out in order to confirm the good performance of the TZFBR. Figure 9 represents the propane conversion and the propylene selectivity for the catalytic propane dehydrogenation at different reaction temperatures employing the optimum conditions established before. Propylene selectivity is lower than 100% because part of the propane is converted to cracking products (eqs 2 and 3) and coke formed (eq 4) is transformed into COx. Under these conditions it was possible to reach steady state behavior for each reaction temperature. In this case, the catalyst was perfectly regenerated in situ, and it maintained the same activity along the time. This performance implies an important process intensification for the analyzed catalytic propane dehydrogenation.

The next stage in the process intensification consists in introducing the hollow fiber palladium selective membrane inside the reactor. One limitation of this kind of membrane is its maximum work temperature, around 600 C, in order not to damage the thin Pd layer. In this regard, gas did not permeate through the Pd membrane under the conditions studied in permeation tests when pure Ar is used as gas stream. This indicates that the Pd membrane consists of a defect-free continuous film with an infinite H2 perm-selectivity (SH2/Ar = ). Thus, H2 permeation takes place via metallic diffusion. (35) Figure 10 shows that the H2 permeation flux increases linearly with the difference of the square root of the H2 partial pressure at both sides of the membrane, according to Sieverts law, indicating that hydrogen permeation is controlled by metallic diffusion through the Pd bulk membrane and not by other steps such as dissociative adsorption or associative desorption. As it can be seen in Figure 10, a H2 permeation of 2.5 mL (STP) cm2 min1 was obtained working at 550 C and a ΔP0.5 of around 7.5 mbar0.5, which is expected to be the pressure gradient in reaction experiments. However, the use as external shell of a porous α-alumina tube leads to a decrease in the hydrogen flux (around 1.7 mL (STP) cm2 min1 at ΔP0.5 = 7.5 mbar0.5).

Figure 11 shows the evolution of the yield to propylene with different reactor configurations at a reaction temperature of 500 C. The novel TZFBR with membrane presents the highest values of yield to propylene with respect to the TZFBR and FBR. In the multifunctional reactor, a part of the produced hydrogen is removed from the catalytic system through the Pd membrane, producing a conversion increase compared to thermodynamic equilibrium in a conventional reactor. With this hydrogen removal, a higher coke formation takes place. This issue is counteracted, in this case, by adjusting the oxygen feed on the regeneration zone to allow the complete catalyst regeneration, making process stability possible. At the same time, the TZFBR configuration shows good result in the catalytic propane dehydrogenation as well, especially for the process stability with high yield to propylene values. On the other hand, FBR presents the worst result in the comparative figure with an important process yield decrease because of the lack of regenerative oxygen on this traditional reactor. This figure shows the process intensification evolution with each reactor. The first intensification occurs when TZFBR is employed replacing the FBR. In this case the process achieves a steady state performance in comparison with the unstable FBR. The second one is possible when a palladium membrane is coupled with the TZFBR to get the coupled TZFBR with membrane. At this moment, when hydrogen is removed from the bed reaction, propane conversion increases, and stability is possible by continuous regeneration. The selectivities to each product with respect to the total products (propylene, C2 hydrocarbons, methane, and COx) obtained in the experiments of Figure 11 are shown in Table 4. For TZFBR and TZFBR+MB configurations these selectivities correspond to a stationary state. For FBR configuration no stationary state is achieved, so the values in Table 4 correspond to the final state attained (i.e., t = 100 min in Figure 11). No net coke generation can be assumed in TZFBR and TZFBR+MB configurations working at steady state. However, in conventional FBR there is a continuous coke generation. As an example, the selectivity to coke with respect to the propane reacted, calculated assuming carbon mass balance closure, was 5.2% in the aforementioned final state (t = 100 min) for FBR run in Figure 11.

Finally, a comparison of obtained results in TZFBR and TZFBR+MB (Figure 11) with previously published results on propane dehydrogenation in other reacting configurations (12, 20, 36-41) is shown in Figure 12. To compare the data regardless of the operating conditions, the results were standardized with the equilibrium conversion for a traditional reactor, accounting for the different temperatures and propane dilutions in each study. Therefore, Figure 12 shows propene selectivity versus conversion/equilibrium conversion (at operating conditions). It may be seen that a higher yield to propylene related to equilibrium conversion of propane in a conventional reactor (Y*C3H6) is obtained with the TZFBR and especially with TZFBR+MB of Pd than with other reacting configuration used in literature. Moreover, it is worth remembering that the literature values shown in Figure 12 are instantaneous results in experiments with catalyst deactivation whereas the values obtained with both the TZFBR and the TZFBR+MB reactor configurations correspond to the steady state when the coke formation is counteracted continuously by the regeneration in the lower zone of the bed.

4 Conclusions
Catalytic propane dehydrogenation has been tested with different reactors at several reaction temperatures with a PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst. The coke formation during reaction with FBR highly influences the process, because it is impossible to maintain propane conversion along the time on the stream and the catalyst must be regenerated. Then, it is not possible to reach a steady state with this reaction system under these experimental conditions. The TZFBR allows working in a continuous way with only one reactor due to the presence of two different atmospheres inside the reactor, where catalyst can circulate between both zones. By this way deactivated catalyst can be regenerated in situ, preserving its activity during the reaction time. The amount of regenerative agent, oxygen, must be optimized for each reaction temperature, which was found to be higher at high temperatures. Finally, the use of a TZFBR with hollow fiber palladium membrane presents good results in the catalytic propane dehydrogenation, where process yield is improved with respect to other reactor configurations. Also, catalyst activity can be maintained. With this 2-fold process configuration, intensification is achieved in regard to FBR, and better results of yield to propylene than those reported in the literature for conventional reactors were obtained. The advantage of using PtSn/MgAl2O4, instead of PtSnK/γAl2O3 as in previous study, comes from its lower coking tendency. The limitation is the operation range of palladium membranes, which is different from the desirable reaction temperature range of the catalytic propane dehydrogenation. New palladium alloy membranes are needed to meet both operation requirements, with the aim of testing TZFBR with membranes at high temperatures.
