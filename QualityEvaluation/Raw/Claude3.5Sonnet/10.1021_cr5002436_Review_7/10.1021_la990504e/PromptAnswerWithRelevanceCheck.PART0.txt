<EnglishVersionAnswer>

This document does not contain information about recent economic factors like shale gas production or their influence on dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production. The text focuses on describing experimental studies of chromia-pillared zirconium phosphate catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss broader economic trends or recent technological advancements in the field. The document also does not address current limitations or areas for improvement in industrial dehydrogenation processes. To answer this question would require information from more recent sources focused on industrial and economic aspects of olefin production technologies.
