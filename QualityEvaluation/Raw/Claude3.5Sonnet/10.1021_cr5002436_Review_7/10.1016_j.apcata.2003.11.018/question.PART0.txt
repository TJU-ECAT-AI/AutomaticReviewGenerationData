Abstract
Theselectivehydrogencombustion(SHC)propertiesofsomemetal-oxidecatalystshavebeeninvestigatedat500and550 Candatmospheric
pressure. This reaction is of importance in the development of new dehydrogenation technology based on partial combustion of hydrogen
to provide in situ heat generation to the endothermic dehydrogenation processes. Selective hydrogen combustion in the presence of light
hydrocarbons is possible under certain reaction conditions for some catalysts. In2O3/SiO2 and unsupported Bi2O3 are able to selectively
combust hydrogen in a gas mixture with propane and oxygen, In2O3/SiO2 being the most active catalyst. Bi2O3/SiO2 and PbOx/SiO2 show
moderate properties as selective hydrogen combustion catalysts in the presence of propane. When propene is added to the gas mixture,
Bi2O3/SiO2 and PbOx/SiO2 are no longer able to selectively combust hydrogen. In2O3/SiO2, on the other hand, shows a higher activity and
combusts hydrogen with 90% selectivity at low oxygen flows, and with 80% selectivity at stoichiometric amounts (to water) of oxygen. The
explanation as to why certain oxides are selective is not known, but differences in electronic structure of the oxides can be linked with different
SHC properties.

1. Introduction
The selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) is a promising
method for improving the catalytic dehydrogenation of light
alkanes, especially propane (see e.g.) [17]. The catalytic
dehydrogenation of propane, Eq. (1), is endothermic and
equilibrium limited (H= 124 kJ/mole). The idea is to
provide in situ heating by oxidising some of the hydrogen
according to Eq. (2), (H= 242 kJ/mole). The sum of
these reactions is the exothermic oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH) of propane, Eq. (3), but the oxygen feed is limited
so that the system

as a whole is reducing. This requires catalysts that are able
to selectively oxidise hydrogen without attacking hydrocar-
bons present in the gas mixture. Grasselli and co-workers
[57] investigated oxide catalysts for SHC. Several catalyst
candidates (metal oxides and mixed metal oxides) were com-
pared using a gravimetric investigation of reduction rates
in hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases, respectively [5]. From
these experiments they proposed that materials that were
more reactive towards hydrogen compared to propane or
propene were suitable SHC catalysts, and they identified ma-
terials like Bi2O3, Bi2Mo3O12, In2O3, In2Mo3O12, Sb2O4
and WO3 (all supported on SiO2) as candidates.
In a recent study [8,9], using a continuous reactor set-up,
we have shown that it is also possible to achieve this se-
lectivity over metallic catalysts. Over a Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst
at 500 C 90% selectivity was achieved using a gas mix-
ture with large amounts of propene. With propane as the
only hydrocarbon in the feed, 100% selectivity to water was
achieved. Selective hydrogen combustion was also shown
for Sn/SiO2, while the unpromoted Pt/SiO2 catalyst was less
selective.

In this paper we will show results of continuous flow
experiments performed with the aim of exploring the se-
lective hydrogen combustion (SHC) properties for some
metal oxide systems previously investigated by Grasselli and
co-workers [57]. The work was done using gas mixtures
containing propane, oxygen and hydrogen, or with large
amounts of propene (simulating high conversions in propane
dehydrogenation).
2. Experimental
Several different catalytic systems were prepared and
tested. Bi2O3/SiO2, In2O3/SiO2, and PbOx/SiO2 were pre-
pared by refluxing aqueous solutions of the appropriate
metal nitrates in the presence of silica (Merck Kieselgel 60,
SBET = 483 m2/g, particle size 0.0630.2 mm). 50 wt.% of
the salts and 50 wt.% of silica were used for both cases.
In the preparation of Bi2O3/SiO2, HNO3 was added to the
solution in order to aid the solubility of bismuth-nitrate.
An unsupported bismuth catalyst was prepared in the same
way as the other catalysts, but in the absence of silica
and HNO3. The resulting slurries were refluxed for 16 h at
70 C, and dried at 120 C for 12 h. The catalysts where then
calcined at 600 C for 12 h with a ramp rate of 5 C/min
from room temperature using an airflow of 50 ml/min
(GHSV = 0.35 l/g h).
The oxide catalysts were characterised by XRD (Phillips
1710
spectrometer
equipped
with
a
graphite
crystal
monochromator, using Cu K radiation).
The BET surface area measurements were performed us-
ing a Carbo Erba Multisampler 1900 apparatus using liquid
nitrogen at its boiling point. The samples were evacuated
and dried at 150 C prior to the surface area measurements.
The reactions were studied in a fixed bed quartz
micro-reactor (U-shaped) with an inner diameter of 3.5 mm.
The reactions were carried out at atmospheric pressure
using air as the oxidant. The catalyst loading was varied
between 0.11 and 0.25 g in the experiments. The reactor
was placed in an electrical furnace, and the temperature
was monitored and controlled using external and internal
thermocouples. The temperature used in the experiments
was 500 or 550 C. The total flow rate was 100 ml/min
with varying compositions of propane, air, propene and
hydrogen, the balance being helium. Gases were premixed
and fed to the reactor using electronic mass flow con-
trollers (Bronkhurst). The product gas was analysed for
hydrocarbons (C1C4) and for permanent gases (O2, N2,
CO, CO2) by GC. The chromatograph used was a Perkin
Elmer autosystem XL equipped with a TCD (Carbosieve
SII, 10ft, mesh 80) and a FID (PoraPLOT Q, 27.5 m, i.d.
0.53 mm). Water and hydrogen produced were not analysed
by the GC, but were calculated through mass balances.
In some of the experiments the catalyst was pre-reduced
for 2 h at reaction temperature with a hydrogen flow of
15 ml/min.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalysts
Table 1 shows some characterization data for the catalysts
used. The supported materials have considerably lower sur-
face areas than the silica support used. The XRD results for
supported bismuth oxide and indium oxide are similar to the
observation reported by Grasselli et al. [6], but while they
report a crystalline phase of Pb3O4 we found no crystalline
Pb-oxide phase.
3.2. Experiments with propane, hydrogen and air
The possibility of gas-phase reactions was investigated in
an empty reactor using a gas flow consisting of 10 ml/min
C3H8, 2 ml/min H2, 2 ml/min O2, balanced by He to
total flow of 100 ml/min. There was no significant con-
version of propane at temperatures below 600 C in the
empty reactor. The oxygen conversion gradually increased
as the temperature was increased from ambient, and at
about 550 C the conversion was 10%. The results are in
good agreement with the work of Creaser and Anders-
son [10] Beretta et al. [11,12]. The main difference be-
tween our experiments compared to the results of the other
groups, is that we had a co-injection of hydrogen in the
feed.
Some catalytic materials were investigated and gave neg-
ative results. Among the systems not showing SHC prop-
erties and therefore not discussed further here were VMgO
(ODH-catalyst, preparation and characterisation described
in [13]), and silica supported Cr2O3 (a conventional DH cat-
alyst). The results using the silica support as catalyst and
50 wt.%Sb2O4/SiO2 was about the same as observed for
the empty reactor at 500 C, very low (37%) conversion of
oxygen and 100% selectivity to water.
The 50 wt.%In2O3/SiO2 was found to be the most active
and selective catalysts for the SHC under these conditions.
In Fig. 1 the activity and selectivity data for the indium cat-
alyst is shown as a function of oxygen flow for two temper-
atures. It is clear from the figure that the oxygen conversion
is independent of the reaction temperature in the range in-
vestigated. The oxygen conversion is high at low oxygen
flows, but when the oxygen flow is above 1 ml/min the con-
version decreases. An oxygen flow of 1 ml/min corresponds
to the stoichiometry of the H2O2 reaction with the co-fed

H2. Water is the main oxygen-containing product at all
oxygen flows, although some CO2 is formed at oxygen flows
of 1 ml/min and upwards. No CO was observed. The selec-
tivity to water was 100% at 500 C, and above 90% for all
oxygen flows at 550 C. The conversions of propane over
the indium catalyst are also shown in the plot. There is no
detectable conversion of propane at 500 C. At 550 C there
was some conversion (in the range 12%), giving propene,
ethene, CO2 and methane as the main products. At low oxy-
gen flows propene is the main C-containing product, but
when the oxygen flow exceeds 1 ml/min there is a sharp
drop in the propene selectivity and both some CO2 and
some ethene and methane formed. The ratio between ethene
and methane is higher that 2:1, as also observed over the
Pt-based system [9]. At the oxygen flow-rate of 1 ml/min the
selectivity ratio ethene: (methane + CO2) is however close
to 2:1. This would indicate that propane is adsorbed and a
CC bond is broken. The C1 fragment can then either des-
orb as methane or be oxidised to CO2 on the surface. With
increasing oxygen flow more CO2 is formed at the expense
of methane and ethene.
In Fig. 2 the results obtained over the Bi2O3 catalysts
(unsupported Bi2O3 and 50 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2) at 500 and
550 C are shown. The unsupported Bi2O3 shows an excel-
lent selectivity in the desired SHC reaction in the presence
of propane, but its activity is not as high as the case is
for the indium catalyst. The drop in the oxygen conversion
is extensive with an increase in the oxygen flow at both
temperatures (Fig. 2a), and at 0.75 ml/min the conversion
is below 50%. Water is the only product formed over the
unsupported bismuth at both temperatures, and there is no
conversion of propane over this catalyst. An experiment
with 50 wt% Bi2O3/SiO2 at 500 C was also performed.
About 80% selectivity to water was obtained throughout
the experiment (the rest being CO2), at oxygen conver-
sions ranging from 45 and down to 25%. It should be
mentioned that the experiment was performed with in-
creasing O2-flow over time. It is possible that the different
response to increased O2 flow also reflects a difference
in the deactivation of the supported/unsupported catalysts
(Fig. 2a, curve B & C), an issue that should be further
studied. The unsupported material was a fine powder that
made surface area measurements difficult, but sintering of
the material could explain the low activity. Pre-reduction
gave no significant changes in the behaviour of the
catalyst.
The results for 50 wt.% PbOx/SiO2 at 500 C are shown
in Fig. 3. This catalyst showed a low activity for oxygen
conversion, and at the same time a moderate selectivity to
water. The oxygen conversion decreased from about 25 to
12% with increasing oxygen flow, indicating that the rate of
oxygen conversion was almost constant with increasing oxy-
gen partial pressure. The selectivity to water was between
70 and 65%, the rest being CO2, no CO was observed. The
propane conversion was low, below 1.5%, and in addition to
CO2 some ethene and propene was formed, but no methane
was observed. The absence of methane is interesting, and
can also in this case be explained by a surface oxidation

of a C-C bond scission. The selectivities observed indicate
that hydrogen is combusted with a higher selectivity than
the hydrocarbon. There was no effect on the results from
pre-reducing the catalyst.

tion between hydrogen and propene (the more reactive

hydrocarbon) towards oxygen, thus simulating a high con-
version in the DH reaction. The catalysts tested at these
conditions were In2O3/SiO2, unsupported Bi2O3, 50%
Bi2O3/SiO2 and PbOx/SiO2, and all the experiments were
done at 500 C. The main results are shown for all the cat-
alysts in Fig. 4. In2O3/SiO2 and Bi2O3/SiO2 give close to
total conversion of oxygen for all oxygen flows. There is,
however, a small amount of unconverted oxygen (in the
range 35% of the oxygen fed to the reactor), as discussed
previously [9]. The activity for oxygen conversion for the
unsupported Bi2O3 decreased from 60 to 10% with increas-
ing oxygen flow, which is similar to that found with only
propane as the hydrocarbon. The PbOx/SiO2 shows con-
siderably higher oxygen conversion with propene present
compared to propane, but still with a strong decline in
conversion with increasing oxygen flows.
In2O3/SiO2 is the only catalyst tested here that is a good
SHC catalyst also in the presence of propene. A 90% se-
lectivity (based on oxygen) to water was obtained at low
oxygen flows (0.5 ml/min), but the selectivity drops off with
increasing oxygen flow. This is due to formation of mainly
CO2, but also some CO.
The other catalyst show close to constant selectivities
for all oxygen flows, thus the selectivity seems to be inde-
pendent of the oxygen partial pressure. Unsupported Bi2O3
gives 65% selectivity to water and 35% selectivity to CO2
for all oxygen flows at these conditions. Bi2O3/SiO2 and
PbOx/SiO2 do not show any tendency towards the selective
combustion of hydrogen preferentially to propene. About
60% selectivity to CO2 is found for these catalysts, which
indicates that the oxygen is mainly used for combustion
of propene. A complete combustion of propene gives 67%
oxygen selectivity to CO2 and 33% selectivity to H2O, ac-
cording to Eq. (4). The corresponding partial oxidation to
CO Eq. (5) gives 50% CO and 50% H2O from the oxy-
gen balance. Since the selectivity to CO2 is above 60% over
the PbOx and supported bismuth catalysts, and there also is
some CO formed, the rate of gas phase hydrogen combus-
tion must be close to zero over these catalysts. From Eq. (3)
and (4) and by using

(5)
the product selectivities (Fig. 4) the contribution to the wa-
ter production from each of the reactions was calculated.
From Fig. 4b-d the selectivities to H2O, CO2 and CO over
Bi2O3/SiO2 at 1 ml/min oxygen are found to be 37, 58 and
4%, respectively. From this it can be estimated that 76% of
the H2O production can be related to Eq. (4), 13% related
to Eq. (2) and the last 11% from Eq. (5). In other words,
the water production from the total combustion of propene
to CO2 is about 6 times faster than the combustion of hy-
drogen over the Bi2O3/SiO2 catalyst. A similar result was
also found for the PbOx/SiO2 catalyst.
4. Mechanism
The reactions involved are clearly surface catalysed, and
on some of the oxides (IN2O3, and to a certain extent also
Bi2O3) hydrogen reacts with high selectivity, in the presence
68
L. Lte et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 262 (2004) 6368
of gas phase propane or propene. It is also interesting to
note that silica-supported In shows a similar behaviour as
silica-supported Sn [9], albeit with better properties for SHC.
The reason for the different behaviour of the indium catalyst
compared to the others is not clear. It has been suggested
[6,7] that the SHC properties of the metal oxides are linked
with a certain electron configuration. Our most selective cat-
alyst, In2O3/SiO2 does not have any free [s2] electron pairs
in the outer shell (In has electron configuration [Kr 4d10 5s2
5p1]). The configuration of In3+ should be similar to Sn4+
in the common oxide SnO2. Pb2+ and Bi3+, on the other
hand have free [s2] electron pairs in their oxidised state (Pb
has electron configuration [Xe 4f14 5d10 6s2 6p2] and Bi
[Xe 4f14 5d10 6s2 6p3]). It is therefore possible that the free
[5s2] electrons in Pb2+ and Bi3+ may affect the catalytic
properties of the metals in a way that favour the adsorption
and total combustion of propene. However, the present data
is not sufficient to draw conclusions on these issues. Oxi-
dation catalysis is complex, oxygen and the fuel molecule
can be activated in many ways, and the present results do
not allow discrimination between the different mechanisms.
Both further reaction studies as well as characterisation of
the oxidation states and other properties of the active and
selective catalysts are necessary to understand and improve
these catalysts.
5. Summary and conclusions
The results show that over some catalysts the selec-
tive combustion of hydrogen in the presence of light hy-
drocarbons is possible under certain reaction conditions.
In2O3/SiO2 and unsupported Bi2O3 show the ability to
combust hydrogen in a gas mixture with propane and oxy-
gen with good selectivity, and also have some selectivity
with a high concentration of propene in the gas mixture.
Bi2O3/SiO2 and PbOx/SiO2 show moderate properties as
selective hydrogen combustion catalysts in the presence of
propene, but are unselective with propene in the gas phase.
The selectivity is clearly linked with surface reactions and
the differences could be due to the different electronic
structure on the surface.
