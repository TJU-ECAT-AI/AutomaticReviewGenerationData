The given literature does not contain any information about recent economic factors, shale gas production, or their influence on dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. The text focuses on experimental studies of propane dehydrogenation using membrane reactors, but does not discuss broader economic trends or recent technological advancements in the field. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided document.

However, the literature does discuss some limitations and areas for improvement in membrane reactor technology for propane dehydrogenation. These include:

1. Membrane stability: Both palladium and silica-based membranes showed stability issues under reaction conditions.

2. Catalyst deactivation: Membrane reactors experienced higher rates of catalyst deactivation compared to conventional reactors.

3. Hydrogen permselectivity: Improvements in hydrogen permselectivity are needed for silica-based membranes without significantly decreasing hydrogen permeance.

4. Sweep gas issues: Backpermeation of sweep gas and resulting downstream separation problems are a concern.

5. High-pressure operation: Development of membranes with improved hydrogen permselectivity is needed for high-pressure operation to reduce propane and propylene losses.

To enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of membrane reactor processes for propane dehydrogenation, these limitations need to be addressed through further research and development.

给定的文献中没有包含关于近期经济因素、页岩气生产或它们对烯烃生产中脱氢技术影响的任何信息。该文本主要关注使用膜反应器进行丙烷脱氢的实验研究，但没有讨论该领域更广泛的经济趋势或最新的技术进展。因此，无法根据提供的文档直接回答这个问题。

然而，文献确实讨论了丙烷脱氢膜反应器技术的一些局限性和需要改进的领域。这些包括：

1. 膜稳定性：钯膜和基于硅的膜在反应条件下都显示出稳定性问题。

2. 催化剂失活：与传统反应器相比，膜反应器经历了更高的催化剂失活率。

3. 氢气渗透选择性：需要改善基于硅的膜的氢气渗透选择性，同时不显著降低氢气渗透率。

4. 扫气问题：扫气的反渗透和由此产生的下游分离问题是一个值得关注的问题。

5. 高压操作：需要开发具有改进的氢气渗透选择性的膜，以实现高压操作，减少丙烷和丙烯的损失。

为了提高丙烷脱氢膜反应器过程的效率、可持续性和工业可行性，需要通过进一步的研究和开发来解决这些局限性。
