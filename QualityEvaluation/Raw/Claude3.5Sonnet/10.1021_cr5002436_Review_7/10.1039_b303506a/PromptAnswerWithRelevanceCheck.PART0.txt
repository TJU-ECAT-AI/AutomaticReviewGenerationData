<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain information about recent economic factors, shale gas production, or current industrial trends in olefin production. The document focuses on describing a novel catalyst (Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5) for alkane dehydrogenation, its performance characteristics, and comparisons with other catalysts. It does not discuss broader economic or technological trends in the industry.

To properly address the question, we would need additional sources that cover recent developments in shale gas production, its impact on the petrochemical industry, and current trends in olefin production technologies. The literature provided is too specific and does not contain the required information to answer the question comprehensively.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给出的科学文献没有包含关于近期经济因素、页岩气生产或烯烃生产当前工业趋势的信息。该文档主要集中描述了一种新型烷烃脱氢催化剂(Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5)、其性能特征以及与其他催化剂的比较。它并未讨论更广泛的行业经济或技术趋势。

为了恰当地回答这个问题，我们需要额外的资料来涵盖页岩气生产的最新发展、其对石油化工行业的影响，以及烯烃生产技术的当前趋势。所提供的文献过于具体，不包含全面回答该问题所需的信息。
