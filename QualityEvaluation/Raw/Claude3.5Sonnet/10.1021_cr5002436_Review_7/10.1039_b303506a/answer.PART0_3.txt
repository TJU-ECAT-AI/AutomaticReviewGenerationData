The given scientific literature does not contain any information about recent economic factors, shale gas production, or their influence on dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. The document focuses on describing a specific catalyst (Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5) for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, its performance, and comparisons with other catalysts. It does not discuss broader economic trends or technological advancements in the field of olefin production.

As the document does not address the topics mentioned in the question, I cannot provide an answer based on the given information. To properly address this question, additional sources discussing current economic factors, shale gas production, and their impacts on olefin production technologies would be required.

给定的科学文献中没有包含任何关于近期经济因素、页岩气生产或它们对烯烃生产中脱氢技术的影响的信息。该文档主要描述了一种特定的烷烃脱氢反应催化剂(Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5)，其性能以及与其他催化剂的比较。它没有讨论烯烃生产领域更广泛的经济趋势或技术进步。

由于文档没有涉及问题中提到的主题，我无法根据给定的信息提供答案。要正确回答这个问题，需要额外的资料来讨论当前的经济因素、页岩气生产及其对烯烃生产技术的影响。
