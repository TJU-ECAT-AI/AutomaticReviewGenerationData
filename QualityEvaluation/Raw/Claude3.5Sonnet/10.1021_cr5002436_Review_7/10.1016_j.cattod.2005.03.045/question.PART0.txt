Abstract
Isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene has been investigated experimentally and by modelling for a membrane reactor and a fixed bed
reactor under similar operating conditions using a Pt/alumina catalyst. Reaction kinetics were obtained from experiments in the fixed bed
reactor. Comparative tests showed that the membrane reactor achieved much higher yields of isobutene and also gave higher selectivities, with
less by-products than the fixed bed system.
Using the kinetic data, the simulations gave good agreement with the fixed bed experiments, but over predicted the yields from the
membrane reactor. Analysis of these results indicated that in the membrane reactor the hydrogen permeability of the membrane was much
greater than its hydrogen transfer requirement and that the reaction rate was the determining factor for isobutene yield.

1. Introduction
The demand for olefins and olefinic products continues to
increase and commercially has resulted in a number of
catalytic dehydrogenation processes. Current processes for
propene and butenes production from the corresponding
alkanes employ mainly fixed bedoperation,but because of the
necessarily high temperatures involved in these reversible
endothermic reactions, catalyst coking rapidly occurs, so that
frequent catalyst regeneration is required. To overcome this
problem a number of alternative procedures have been
suggested. One of these is oxidative dehydrogenation in
which partial oxidation of the alkane limits to some extent the
endothermic reaction requirement. A sizeable amount of
information on this method is available in the literature
especially for propane dehydrogenation [14]. A drawback is
the potential problem of flammability, with the necessity of
adopting a distributed feed in some instances [5].
An alternative is the use of a membrane reactor. In recent
years, the possibility of overcoming the equilibrium
constraint in reversible reactions such as dehydrogenations
has attracted wide attention. Separation of the hydrogen
product permits a higher conversion or better selectivity to
be achieved. Alternatively, operation may be made under
less severe conditions with a consequent reduction in the
extent of coking and less need to regenerate the catalyst.
Porous membranes such as glass and alumina [6,7] have
been used to study the catalytic dehydrogenation of
hydrocarbons and conversions as high as two to seven
times the equilibrium level have been observed for some
reactions [810]. However, these membranes exhibit poor
selectivity, due largely to the nature of the flow process in
their pore structure.
Dense metallic membranes on the other hand, such as
palladium and its alloys possess exclusive selectivity to
hydrogen and if they can be made sufficiently thin can
provide adequate fluxes for hydrogen [11,12]. The usual
method of achieving this is to use a porous metal or ceramic,
onto which a very thin but selective film is deposited.
Typically such membranes have hydrogen permeabilities of
about 101 mol m2 s1 bar1 [13,14].
Isobutane dehydrogenation using catalytic membrane
reactors has been studied previously by a number of

researchers. Ionnides and Gavalas [15] used a dense silica
membrane reactor and obtained increases in selectivity and
yield over a fixed bed reactor at higher space times. Matsuda
et al. [16] employed a palladium membrane reactor and
tested both a chromia/alumina and a platinum alumina
catalyst. The isobutene yield for both was greater than for a
conventional reactor. Shu et al. [17] used a membrane
reactor with a very thin palladium film, while Casanave et al.
used both microporous and zeolite membrane reactors for
this reaction [18,19]. Further zeolite membrane reactor
results by Ciavarella et al. [20] discussed the effect of
operating conditions. Using a palladium membrane reactor,
Raybold et al. [21] found that due to the very slow kinetics
obtained in their system, it was necessary to add oxygen to
the feed to increase the yield of isobutene.
In the present paper, the performance of a palladium/
silver membrane reactor containing a platinum catalyst
within the membrane tube, is compared with a conventional
fixed bed reactor under the same operating conditions.
Experimental kinetic data obtained for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst
used were employed to develop mathematical models to
predict the performance of both the membrane and the fixed
bed reactor.
2. Experimental
Experiments were conducted in a membrane reactor
comprising a porous stainless steel tube (average pore
diameter 1.2 mm) on the outside surface of which a
palladium/silver film was coated. Details of the procedure
are given elsewhere [22,23]. This composite membrane tube
was surrounded by a coaxial heated shell of stainless steel.
The effective length of the membrane was 180 mm with an
outside diameter of 12.7 mm. Sealing of the membrane tube
within the reactor was achieved using graphite rings.
Equant 3 mm pellets of 0.5% Pt/alumina were placed
within the bore of the membrane tube. The fixed bed reactor
comprised a non-porous stainless steel tube of the same
dimensions as the membrane tube and contained the same
amount of catalyst. The palladium/silver film was deposited
by sequential electroless plating, followed by annealing at
700 8C to give a film of 10 microns thickness with a
composition of approximately 20% silver. The resultant Pd/
Ag membrane had a hydrogen/nitrogen selectivity of 1200 to
1500 depending on the pressure difference and gave a
hydrogen permeance of 0.8 to 1.0 m mol/(m2 s Pa).
The feed stream was a mixture of 80% isobutane and 20%
hydrogen, fed at isobutane flow rates from 168 to 314 ml/min
and both gas steams were mass flow controlled. Nitrogen gas
was used as sweep, cocurrent to the reactant feed.
Product analysis was by gas chromatography for the
hydrocarbon gases using an FID detector, while a hydrogen
gas analyser measured the concentrations of hydrogen on-
line at the exits of both shell and tube sides of the membrane
reactor. Temperature profiles for both reactors were constant
to within 3 8C over the effective length of both reactors.
3. Results and discussion
Initial experiments were made with a commercial
chromia/alumina catalyst located within the reactor tube
of the fixed bed reactor, but this failed to produce significant
yields of isobutene within the temperature range of interest
(450520 8C). Therefore, a platinum/alumina catalyst was
used in all subsequent experiments.
The activity of this catalyst was tested in the fixed bed
mode and a sharp drop of activity was observed, the
conversion of isobutane falling to less than 5% over a period
of 6 h. In order to avoid this rapid activity decrease the
addition of 20% hydrogen was made to the isobutane feed
and the results for both the fixed bed and the membrane
reactor are illustrated in Fig. 1 together with the case
where no hydrogen was added. Clearly the addition of
hydrogen has provided a more stable catalyst activity,
although a slow decrease is still observed. However,
throughout the period of a measurement (up to 23 h) the
activity was essentially constant. The activity decrease for
the membrane reactor was slightly greater than that for the
fixed bed mode even with hydrogen addition; this is due
mainly to the removal of hydrogen by permeation from the
tube side in the membrane reactor giving a higher
concentration of olefin which has a greater potential for
coke deposition than the isobutane.
All reported experiments for the membrane reactor were
made with a sweep gas of nitrogen at flow rates from 100 to
1000 ml/min and atmospheric pressure on the sweep side. In
addition, a fairly high flow rate of 168 ml/min of isobutane
combined with 42 ml/min of hydrogen was adopted in most
experiments. Since the catalyst particles used had the
platinum deposited on the external surface, intraparticle
concentration gradients were absent. Estimates [24] of the
partial pressure difference of the reactant isobutane between

the bulk gas and the surface gave values of less than 0.5%
indicating that the flow rate used was sufficient to overcome
any external mass transfer restriction. Also, because the
platinum in the platinum/alumina catalyst pellets was
deposited solely on the outer surface of the catalyst pellets,
internal diffusion of reactants and products within the
catalyst
pellet
can
be
neglected.
Hence,
under
the
experimental conditions used in the present work neither
form of mass transfer was important.
The effect of sweep gas flow rate is shown in Figs. 2 and 3
for temperatures of 485 and 520 8C, respectively, where
yields of isobutene are plotted against residence time for the
fixed bed reactor and for the membrane reactor with two
sweep flow rates of 100 and 1000 ml/min. The yield of
isobutene increased slowly as the residence time increased,
but the major effect was the increased yield shown by the
membrane reactor compared with the fixed bed reactor.
Thus, for a temperature of 485 8C (Fig. 2) at a residence
time of 3.5 s the yield for the fixed bed reactor was 10%,
that for the 100 ml/min sweep was 15% and for the 1000 ml/
min sweep a value of 20% was attained. Fig. 3 shows
the corresponding plots at the higher temperature of
520 8C. The yield increases with residence time as for the
lower
temperature,
but
the
yields
of
isobutene
are
significantly higher with 17% attained for the fixed bed
reactor and 22 and 29% for the 100 and 1000 ml/min sweep
flows in the membrane reactor, all at a residence time of
3.5 s.
Equilibrium yields calculated from the feed conditions
used were 11.6 and 20.7 for temperatures of 485 and 520 8C,
respectively. For the fixed bed reactor in Fig. 2 the
equilibrium yield is barely attained even for the highest
residence time of 3.7 s. However, use of a sweep gas with the
membrane reactor, enables the equilibrium yield to be
exceeded for all residence times and at a sweep flow of
1000 ml/min and a residence time of 3.7 s the experimental
yield is almost double the equilibrium value.
Similar results are obtained at 520 8C (Fig. 3), but now
the equilibrium yield of 20.7% is exceeded throughout the
whole range of residence times for the highest sweep rate
only. Clearly the increased equilibrium yield is not matched
by a corresponding increase in the hydrogen permeation
rate.
The product stream from the membrane reactor was
found to consist of isobutane, isobutene, hydrogen, methane,
propane/propene and very small amounts of C2 and C4
hydrocarbons. This result is consistent with previous reports
[15,17,19] and the main side reaction is assumed to be either
isobutane decomposition
i  C4H10 ! CH4  C3H6
but it seems more likely in the present context that the
hydrogenolysis reaction
i  C4H10  H2 ! C3H8  CH4
is predominant, because the equilibrium constant of the
former reaction is very small under the present operating
conditions.
The fractional conversion to by-products is illustrated in
Fig. 4 for an operating temperature of 520 8C for two
membrane reactor sweep flow rates and for the fixed bed
(conventional) reactor. The fixed bed reactor shows a three-

fold increase in by-products compared to the membrane
reactor with the higher sweep rate.
The higher yields obtained with the membrane reactor
with a sweep gas are caused in part by the higher selectivities
compared to fixed bed operation as shown in Fig. 5 for two
bed pressures of 1.06 and 1.54 bar. In general, a lower
pressure favours selectivity since a lower pressure is
beneficial for the main reaction which occurs with a volume
expansion, but should have no effect on the side reaction.
This was observed in the fixed bed reactor where for the
shortest residence time of 2 s a selectivity of 75% at
1.06 bar and 67% at 1.54 bar was obtained whereas the
membrane reactor showed a progressive narrowing of the
yield difference between the two pressures as the sweep
flow increased until at a sweep flow of 1000 ml/min the
difference was only 12%. Furthermore, all membrane
reactor selectivities were greater than those for the fixed
bed, lying in the range from 75 to 92%. Another feature is
that the selectivity of the fixed bed reactor decreased with
increase in residence time as might be expected, due to
increase of side reactions with a longer residence of
reactants and products in the catalyst bed. No such
behaviour was observed for the membrane reactor, where
the
selectivity
was
almost
entirely
independent
of
residence time.
The increased conversion in the membrane reactor with
increase of pressure is due primarily due to hydrogen
removal from the reaction zone, so that the dehydrogenation
reaction occurred in a region remote from equilibrium. Also
higher pressure is more favourable for hydrogen removal
from the membrane. However, selectivity is a result of the
different rates of the main and side reactions. A higher
operating pressure increases the rate of the reverse of the
main reaction and hence slows down the main forward rate,
but the side reaction is unaffected. Therefore, the selectivity
becomes lower as the pressure is increased. Nevertheless, a
high sweep flow rate removes more hydrogen, resulting in a
lower hydrogen partial pressure, which reduces the rate of
the reverse of the main reaction and also reduces the rate of
the side reaction. As mentioned above, high pressure
facilitates the membranes removal of hydrogen and
consequently the effect of pressure on selectivity becomes
less.
3.1. Simulation
The simulation of the fixed bed reactor is based on the
following assumptions:
 flow within the reactor tube is in plug flow;
 operation is isothermal and isobaric.
For the simulation of the membrane reactor, in addition to
the above assumptions the following conditions were also
applied:
 the membrane is permeable to hydrogen only;
 the sweep gas is also in plug flow;
 diffusion of hydrogen through the Pd/Ag membrane is in
accordance with the relation J = K[(PHf)n(PHs)n], where
K and n are constant at a given temperature and are
obtained from permeation measurements. The subscripts
Hf and Hs refer to hydrogen partial pressures on the feed
and shell sides of the membrane, respectively.
Regression analysis of the conversionresidence time
data from the fixed bed reactor were used to derive rate
expressions for both the main and side (hydrogenolysis)
reactions. The appropriate rate equations were:
At 485 8C
rA1  2:106 PA  PBPC
0:0782

rA2  0:989PAPB
At 520 8C
rA1  2:462 PA  PBPC
0:196

rA2  1:212PAPC
where rA1 and rA2 refer to the dehydrogenation and hydro-
genolysis reactions, respectively and the subscripts A, B, and
C represent in turn isobutane, isobutene and hydrogen.
These reaction rate equations were incorporated into the
model.
Good agreement was obtained between experimental and
simulation results for the fixed bed reactor. However, the
simulation results for the membrane reactor gave consis-
tently slightly higher values than those for experiments. A
typical plot is shown in Fig. 6 and although there is
appreciable scatter in the experimental values the difference
is apparent especially for the higher sweep rates. Permeation
measurements had shown a decline in hydrogen perme-

ability after the first few experiments, which was attributed
to contamination from feed and product gases. Hence, it is
believed that the hydrogen permeabilities in the membrane
reactor are lower than those for the fresh membrane, the
latter being the values taken for the simulations such as that
shown in Fig. 6. Empirically, it was found that if the
hydrogen permeability was reduced to about 20% of the
value obtained from the hydrogen permeation measure-
ments, where an uncontaminated membrane was used, the
simulated results for the membrane reactor are now
consistent with their experimental counterparts as shown
in Fig. 7. In this figure, the fractional values of the original
(measured) permeablities are denoted by the symbol f.
A comparison of the simulated yields of isobutene for
values of f from 0.21 to 2 for a sweep flow of 600 ml/min is
given in Fig. 8, which also shows the fixed bed experimental
results for the same operating conditions. It can be noted that
the simulated yield of isobutene for an f value of 1 is not
much higher than that for f = 0.21, and there is barely any
difference between the yields for f = 1 and 2. This signifies,
that in the present research the permeation ability of the
membrane is not limiting. It is the reaction kinetics that limit
the yield of isobutene.
Confirmation of this is given in Fig. 9, where simulations
have been made of isobutene yield versus space time for
three assumed reaction rates, based on multiples of the
measured experimental reaction rate, rA1. Thus, 1.1rA1
represents a rate 1.1 times the reaction rate of rA1, while
1.2rA1 represents a reaction rate 1.2 times faster and so on.
For the fixed bed reactor, it is understandable that a higher
reaction rate does not affect the yield at high space times
because
the
reaction
is
reversible.
However,
in
the
membrane reactor, the yield of isobutene continues to
increase as the reaction rate is increased.
4. Conclusions
A comparison has been made between experimental
results obtained for a Pd/Ag composite membrane reactor
and a fixed bed reactor for the catalytic dehydrogenation of
isobutane to isobutene using a Pt/alumina catalyst. Because
of deactivation of the Pt catalyst, experiments were
conducted with a reactant feed of 20% hydrogen in
isobutane. Two reactions were identified as occurring, the
main dehydrogenation reaction and a side reaction produ-

cing C3 hydrocarbons and methane only. Isobutane yields
were much higher in the membrane reactor and the higher
selectivities obtained with the membrane reactor were the
result of the high hydrogen removal rates caused by the
sweep gas flow.
Whereas increase of pressure reduced the yield in the
fixed bed reactor, the yield increased slightly with pressure
in the membrane reactor, confirming that the overall reaction
in the membrane reactor was not influenced by equilibrium.
Sweep flow rate plays an important role in increasing the
conversion in the membrane reactor, a 10-fold increase in
sweep rate producing a conversion increase of between 45
and 55%.
A simple isothermal model of the process was developed,
which although giving good agreement with the fixed bed
results, indicated that transport in the membrane reactor was
not limited by the permeability of the membrane to
hydrogen, but was caused by the relatively low values of
the reaction rate produced by the catalyst.
