<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about recent economic factors like shale gas production or their influence on dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production. The text focuses on specific catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2, but does not discuss broader economic trends or technological advancements in the field. There is no mention of shale gas, industrial viability, or sustainability considerations for these processes. The document is limited to a narrow experimental study and does not address the wider context asked about in the question.
