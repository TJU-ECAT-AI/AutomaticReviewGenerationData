Unlike the perfect lens based on negative re-
fraction (13), loss is not an issue in this instance
because the fields are translated through loss-less
vacuum. The issue here is whether a time-reversing
sheet can be found sufficiently powerful to give the
resolution, D, required
D ≈1=k∥max ≈d=ln R
ð13Þ
A scheme for subwavelength resolution
was also proposed in (9) but, as noted above,
this scheme depended on the existence of sur-
face states derived from a mathematically postu-
lated boundary for which no physical realization
has so far been suggested.
Although our discussion has been in terms of
electromagnetic waves, the same principles apply
to any waves and particularly to acoustic waves,
where time-reversal studies are also well devel-
oped (14).
Our original discussion (illustrated in Fig. 2)
assumes a single-step transition from +w to –w.
Such processes occur but are very weak. At op-
tical frequencies, perhaps the best system for the
realization of these ideas is a four-wave mixing
experiment: One of two counterpropagating pump
beams of the same frequency as the signal writes
a hologram. The second pump beam then reads
the hologram to produce a time-reversed signal.
In other words, there is a two-step process in
which there first occurs a transition +w →0 and
then a second transition 0 →–w. This process has
much in common with the recent proposal for a
subwavelength focusing device (15), except
that in our scheme the system writes its own
hologram.
As a generalization of the analogy, any pos-
itively refracting medium can have the sign of its
refraction reversed by coating the surface with a
phase-reversing sheet. This leads to the possibil-
ity of curved lenses that can magnify an object
(16).
In principle, our new lens can be realized if
the hologram is written in a thin sheet of non-
linear material. In practice, such a hologram would
be very weak, and instead, 3D holograms are
written if a strong output is desired. As a con-
sequence of the 3D nature of the hologram, the
second phase-reversed beam (shown on the right
of Fig. 1C) is not seen, but if the left-hand surface
of the medium is half silver (Fig. 4), reflection of
the phase-reversed beam will generate an image
to the right of the system reproducing the effect
predicted in Fig. 1C and mimicking the Veselago
negatively refracting lens. However, the 3D na-
ture of the hologram precludes any subwave-
length resolution.
Creating a 2D hologram and attaining the
ideal shown in Fig. 3 will be a challenge. Enhanc-
ing the nonlinearity of existing media—possibly
through the use of plasmonic or metamaterial
layers to enhance the local fields (17)—may offer
a route to realizing a 2D version and hence sub-
wavelength resolution. Further discussion of the
practicalities of a four-wave mixing scheme can
be found in the SOM.

Surface-Modified Carbon Nanotubes
Catalyze Oxidative Dehydrogenation
of n-Butane
Jian Zhang, Xi Liu, Raoul Blume, Aihua Zhang, Robert Schlögl, Dang Sheng Su*
Butenes and butadiene, which are useful intermediates for the synthesis of polymers and other
compounds, are synthesized traditionally by oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane over
complex metal oxides. Such catalysts require high O2/butane ratios to maintain the activity,
which leads to unwanted product oxidation. We show that carbon nanotubes with modified surface
functionality efficiently catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes, especially
butadiene. For low O2/butane ratios, a high selectivity to alkenes was achieved for periods as
long as 100 hours. This process is mildly catalyzed by ketonic C=O groups and occurs via a
combination of parallel and sequential oxidation steps. A small amount of phosphorus greatly
improved the selectivity by suppressing the combustion of hydrocarbons.
T
ransition metal oxides have been widely
used as catalysts for the conversion of
butane to C4 alkenes, important industrial
precursors for producing synthetic rubbers,
plastics, and a number of industrially important
chemicals. Despite a great deal of research,
alkene selectivity in the current butane-to-
butadiene process is severely limited (1). One
important reason is that the unsaturated products
are much more readily oxidized to CO2 than is
the starting alkane. The chemical complexity of
polyvalent metal oxides, although found to be
necessary for catalytic activity, impedes satisfactory
selectivity through isolation of active sites (2−6).
For this reason, the origin of the catalytic activity
is debated, and there is as yet no generally ac-
cepted picture of the reaction mechanism (7, 8).
Carbon materials have been reported to
catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)
of an aromatic molecule, ethylbenzene. Howev-
er, conventional carbons, in particular activated
carbon, underwent unavoidable deactivations

due to coking or combustion (9−12). Recently, it
was shown that only well-nanostructured carbons
are stable and coke-free catalysts for styrene
synthesis (12, 13). Activation of C−H bonds in
the ethyl group is considered to be coordinated by
the ketonic carbonyl (C=O) group. Ethylbenzene
has an aromatic moiety that enables relatively
facile activation. Here, we report on surface-
modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a high-
performance catalyst for the ODH of the much
less active butane. Relative to metal-based cat-
alysts, CNTs displayed an enhanced selectivity
to C4 alkenes, especially butadiene.
We conducted the reaction at 400° or 450°C
with an O2/butane ratio of 2.0. The product mix-
ture contained only 1-butene, 2-butene, buta-
diene, CO2, CO, and residual reactants; the
resulting carbon balance was 100 T 3% (fig.
S1A) (14). In a blank experiment without cat-
alyst, the alkene yield was as low as 0.9%. Over
pristine CNTs, 88.9% of the converted butane
was burnt, yielding 1.6% alkenes (Fig. 1A). Con-
sidering the intensive stability of CNTs in O2
(fig. S1B) (14), we conclude that the CO2 during
the reaction mainly originated from the oxida-
tion of the hydrocarbon feedstock and not from
burning of the carbon catalysts. Neither washing
CNTs in HCl solution nor loading with acidic
nitro group could enhance the selectivity to al-
kene (fig. S2) (14).
We then functionalized surfaces of pristine
CNTs with oxygen-containing groups by reflux-
ing and oxidizing them in concentrated HNO3
(15). With the resulting oCNTs as catalyst, we
observed an improved yield of 6.7% alkenes.
The alkene yield was further enhanced to 13.8%
after the oCNTs catalyst was additionally mod-
ified by passivating defects with phosphorus
[P-oCNTs, 0.5 T 0.1 weight percent (wt %) P].
The increase in alkene selectivity is partially ex-
plained in Fig. 1B, which compares the catalytic
performance of oCNTs and P-oCNTs for three
individual reactions: (i) ODH of butane, (ii) ODH
of 1-butene, and (iii) combustion of butadiene.
The passivation apparently suppresses the acti-
vation and deep oxidation of the alkene substrates.
A survey of recent literature showed that
the P-oCNTs catalyst is as selective as the best
V/MgO catalyst developed during the past 20
years (fig. S3A) (14). To compare the present
reaction conditions to those previously used, we
synthesized and evaluated two V/MgO samples.
At the same conversion of butane, the Mg3V2O8
and Mg3V2O7 samples were less selective than
P-oCNTs (fig. S3B) (14); in particular, relative
to Mg3V2O7, P-oCNTs gave twice the selectiv-
ity to butadiene (16.2%).
Safety can be a challenge when mixing hy-
drocarbons with oxidants. One solution is to
operate the reaction under anaerobic conditions.
After we reduced the O2/butane ratio from 2.0 to
0.5, the P-oCNTs sample still exhibited outstand-
ing stability. During a reaction lasting 100 hours,
the butane and oxygen conversion remained
almost unchanged, and the alkene selectivity
stayed above 53% (Fig. 1C). To the best of our
knowledge, the oxidative stability of P-oCNTs
far exceeds those of metal oxide catalysts, which
only work well with excess oxygen (O2/butane ≥
2), a condition necessary to prevent severe de-
activation due to coke deposition.
In Fig. 1D, we show the ODH activity of
oCNTs and P-oCNTs as a function of residence
time. These results demonstrate that the overall
reaction comprises a combination of parallel and
sequential oxidation steps. The alkene selectivity
at zero residence time was not unity (16), indi-
cating that direct butane combustion occurred in
parallel with the ODH reactions (i.e., butane to
butenes, butane to butadiene). Two reaction path-
ways to butadiene were identified. Selectivity
toward butadiene remained finite at the zero resi-
dence time, evidencing a primary ODH of butane
to butadiene; it increased with the residence time
as the selectivity of butenes deceased, revealing
a secondary ODH of butenes to butadiene.

constants for primary reactions were quantified
as the residence time approached zero (16). After
the modification with P, three important changes
happened at the initial state: (i) The overall rate of
converted butane decreased from 0.75 to 0.56
mmol g–1 hour–1; (ii) the combustion of butane
was reduced by as much as a factor of 2.3; and
(iii) the formation rate of alkenes kept nearly
unchanged at 0.38 to 0.40 mmol g–1 hour–1.
Therefore, P increased the selectivity by sup-
pressing the combustion rate, rather than en-
hancing the formation rate of alkenes.
One of the key concerns in identifying and
describing metal-free catalysis is the suspected
influence of metal impurities in the catalyst.
Commercial CNTs were prepared on supported
metal catalysts, which inevitably remain as met-
al contaminants. Post-treatment by refluxing in
strong acid effectively removed the residual
metals to a great extent. X-ray fluorescence spec-
trometry revealed that the residual metals in the
tested CNTs were very low (table S1) (14). The
highest value of residual Fe was still as low as
0.09 wt %, as confirmed by energy-dispersive
x-ray analysis (around 0.1 wt %). Furthermore,
there was no signal of Fe or other metals in the
surface layer at the limit of detection by
synchrotron-excited x-ray photoelectron spec-
troscopy (XPS) (Fig. 2A). This difference
suggests that if there is residual metal, it must
be embedded in the carbon and not exposed to
the reactants. This explanation is supported by
the high-resolution transmission electron mi-
croscopy (HRTEM) image in Fig. 2B, which
shows a catalyst particle encapsulated inside
the CNTs. To fully exclude the role of Fe in the
reaction, we deliberately added Fe to oCNTs in
fractions ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 wt %. As
shown in Fig. 2C, both the butane conversion
and selectivity to C4 alkenes gradually decreased
with the increasing Fe content. Furthermore,
there was no correlation of alkene selectivity
with the residual metal content (fig. S4A) (14).
We prepared a sample with 5% Fe phosphate in
oCNTs; this sample also exhibited performance
inferior to that of P-oCNTs without Fe (fig. S4B)
(14). We can thus conclude that the reactivity
originated exclusively from metal-free active sites
on CNTs and that the residual metals played no
positive role.
To elucidate the structure-activity relation, we
studied the morphological features by TEM with
elemental mapping. Figure 3A gives an overview
elemental map from a typical area. Both P and O
are dispersed throughout the sample without
aggregation. After an ODH reaction that ran for
more than 800 min, the morphology of the CNTs
remained intact and no evidence for their
combustion was identified (Fig. 3B), as expected
from the thermal stability data (fig. S1B) (14).
Some areas of the outer and inner walls of the
CNTs were covered by thin layers of phosphorus,
which obviously differs from fullerenoid carbon
species on pristine CNTs originating from con-
densation of hydrocarbon fragments (fig. S5)
(14). Most of the surface of the CNTs did not
give rise to carbon deposition, which is one ad-
vantage of this metal-free catalyst.
We also monitored the working surface of
CNTs with near-ambient XPS (17). The best
P-oCNTs catalyst was heated in vacuum to
350°C; at this temperature, the less stable groups
(anhydride, carboxyl, ester, and nitro) would al-
ready have desorbed from the surface (fig. S6)
(14). We identified two contributions from
ketonic C=O groups (531.2 T 0.2 eV) and from
C−O groups (533.1 T 0.2 eV) (i.e., ether and
hydroxyl) (15, 18). Relative amounts of C−O
and C=O are represented in Fig. 3C by the ratio

of their intensities, I(C−O)/I(C=O). Under ODH con-
ditions (butane + O2, 1:1, 0.25 atm, 350° to 375°C),
I(C−O)/I(C=O) values ranged from 0.72 to 0.80.
However, after switching off O2, the I(C−O)/I(C=O)
value sharply increased to 1.87 (Fig. 3C) and the
activity went to almost zero. This finding indicates
that ketonic C=O groups are a critical ingredient of
the active sites, whereas C−O groups constitute in-
active intermediates or adsorbates.
Figure 4A summarizes our proposed mecha-
nism for the CNTs-catalyzed butane oxidation.
For this purpose, surface oxygen species are clas-
sified into electrophilic (superoxide O2
−, peroxide
O2
2−) and nucleophilic (O2−) types (19). Electro-
philic oxygen species are electron-deficient and
attack the electron-rich C=C bonds in alkenes, lead-
ing to the rupture of the carbon skeleton and sub-
sequent combustion. Pristine CNTs were produced
from chemical vapor deposition of unsaturated
hydrocarbons, resulting in a number of structur-
al defects and terminal carbon fragments. Below
600°C, these defect sites or edges of graphene
have been reported to convert O2 molecules to
electrophilic oxygen species (20) and thus cause
low selectivity to alkenes.
More controlled oxidation of carbon surfaces
can be carried out in liquid-phase oxidants (21).
After refluxing in HNO3, defect sites were func-
tionalized by O2−anions into various functional
groups. For example, ketonic C=O, a nucleo-
philic species with high electron density, preferen-
tially reacts with electron-poor saturated bonds.
However, at the reaction temperature, desorption
of less stable groups results in new graphitic
defects that subsequently generate new electro-
philic oxygen sites, thus partially limiting the
selectivity to alkenes on oCNTs. The addition of
phosphate reacting with these defects suppresses
the formation of electrophilic oxygen species
(22). Thus, P-oCNTs displayed a lower overall
activity but a much better selectivity.
We used density functional theory (DFT)
calculations with the CASTEP code and the
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient
approximation (23, 24) to study the ODH
reaction over ketonic C=O groups. These cal-
culations are independent of the precise mecha-
nism and the transition state of each elementary
step. We used the graphitic zigzag edge as a
model to anchor the ketonic C=O groups (Fig.
4B). Conversion of butane is energetically con-
trolled by the abstraction of the first H atom,
which was predicted to be mildly endothermic at
0.92 eV
. To convert butane into 1- or 2-butene,
two C=O sites would ultimately be needed, and
each one returns a single electron to the surround-
ing graphene as the reservoir. The remaining H
atoms combine with surrounding oxygen to water,
thereby closing the primary ODH cycle. The en-
thalpy of formation of water compensates for the
endothermic dehydrogenation of butane. As a con-
sequence, the calculated free energies for formation
of 1- and 2-butenes were −0.88 eVand −1.03 eV
,
respectively. Another pathway to regenerate active
sites is that H atoms recombine into H2 molecules.
However,asexpected,suchadirectdehydrogenation
reaction is energetically unfavorable, because en-
ergy barriers are as high as 1.45 to 1.60 eV.
The DFT calculation also provides insights
into the reaction pathways to butadiene. Butadi-
ene may directly form from butane as primary
product with an overall energy of −1.97 eV.
However, the need for neighboring C=O sites to
accommodate four H atoms in one elementary
step does not seem to be pronounced, accounting
for a much lower rate than the secondary ODH
from butenes (Fig. 1D). It is more likely that C=O
primarily activates butenes (rather than butane)
to butadiene. The energy for the abstraction of
the first H from butenes (DEbutenes,1H), 0.25 to
0.40 eV, is much lower than that from butane
(DEbutane,1H), 0.92 eV. In this way, we can un-
derstand the influence of residence time. Because
the residence time is long enough for the butenes
produced to diffuse and react with the surround-
ing C=O sites, butadiene will be primarily gen-
erated from the secondary ODH, as demonstrated
by the prevailing fraction of butadiene in C4 al-
kenes in an integral reaction, 63 to 74% (Fig. 1A).
Our work contains some implications for
catalysis in general. It is possible to imitate hetero-
geneously the concepts of homogeneous metal-
free catalysis. The function of oxygen heteroatoms
in molecular catalysts is reproduced by defects of
bent graphitic sheets. The catalytic principle of site
isolation can be realized by electronic localization
of charges at the defect sites corresponding to
molecular analogs of double bonds. The operation
mode of ODH reactions can be studied on metal-
free catalysts with greater precision than in metal
oxide systems. There is neither lattice nor structural
oxygen, but only oxygen at active sites. The present
catalysts are free of polyvalent metal sites with
complex electronic and spin structures, allowing for
a facile theoreticaltreatment. Finally,the application
of a heterogeneous CNTs catalyst is attractive be-
cause of favorable management of energy over a
good thermal and electronic conductor.

Merging Photoredox Catalysis with
Organocatalysis: The Direct
Asymmetric Alkylation of Aldehydes
David A. Nicewicz and David W. C. MacMillan*
Photoredox catalysis and organocatalysis represent two powerful fields of molecule activation that
have found widespread application in the areas of inorganic and organic chemistry, respectively.
We merged these two catalysis fields to solve problems in asymmetric chemical synthesis.
Specifically, the enantioselective intermolecular a-alkylation of aldehydes has been accomplished
using an interwoven activation pathway that combines both the photoredox catalyst Ru(bpy)3Cl2
(where bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine) and an imidazolidinone organocatalyst. This broadly applicable, yet
previously elusive, alkylation reaction is now highly enantioselective and operationally trivial.
N
ature’s ability to convert solar energy to
chemical energy in photosynthesis has
inspired the development of a host of
photoredox systems in efforts to mimic this
process. Arguably the most studied one-electron
photoredox catalyst has been Ru(bpy)3
2+ (where
bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine): an inorganic complex
that has facilitated important advances in the
areas of energy storage, hydrogen and oxygen
evolution from water, and methane production
from carbon dioxide (1, 2). Given its proven
ability to mediate electron transfer, it is surpris-
ing that Ru(bpy)3
2+ has not found a substantial
application in organic synthesis, wherein a large
number of fundamental reactions rely on the gen-
eration and exploitation of radicals or single-
electron intermediates (3).
Over the past decade, the field of organo-
catalysis has grown at a dramatic pace, provid-
ing more than 130 chemical reactions that rapidly
facilitate enantioselective C–C, C–O, C–N, and
C–halogen bond formation (4, 5). Whereas a
broad range of reaction types have recently suc-
cumbed to this mode of catalysis (including aldol,
Friedel-Crafts, and cycloadditions), it is important
to consider that nearly all organocatalytic bond
constructions are restricted to two-electron path-
ways, wherein the highest occupied molecular
orbital of an electron-rich substrate reacts with
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of an
electron-deficient partner. Recently, however, our
laboratory introduced the concept of organo–
singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) ca-
talysis, a one-electron mode of activation that has
enabled the development of several useful trans-
formations (6–10).
Given the widespread success of both elec-
tron transfer catalysis and organocatalysis, we
recently questioned whether it might be possible
to merge these two powerful areas, with the goal
of solving long-standing, yet elusive problems in
chemical synthesis. More specifically, as a blue-
print for reaction invention, we hoped to exploit
the lessons of photoredox enzymatic catalysis
(11), wherein a series of consecutive low-barrier,
open-shell steps are energetically preferred to high-
barrier, two-electron pathways. On this basis, we
hypothesized that the enantioselective catalytic
a-alkylation of aldehydes (12–15), a widely sought
yet elusive transformation, might be brought to
fruition via the marriage of inorganic electron
transfer and organic catalysis (Fig. 1).
