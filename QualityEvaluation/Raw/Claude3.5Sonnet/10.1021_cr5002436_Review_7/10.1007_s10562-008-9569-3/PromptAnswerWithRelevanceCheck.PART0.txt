<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about recent economic factors, shale gas production, or technological advancements in dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production. The document focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using carbon dioxide over CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts. It does not discuss broader economic trends or industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes. To properly answer this question, additional sources with more recent and industry-wide information would be needed.
