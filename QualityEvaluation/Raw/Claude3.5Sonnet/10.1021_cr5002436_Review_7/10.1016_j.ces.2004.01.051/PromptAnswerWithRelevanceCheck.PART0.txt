<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about recent economic factors like shale gas production or their influence on dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. The document focuses on a specific study of a carbon membrane reactor for isobutane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss broader economic trends or technological advancements in the field. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided text.

To properly address this question would require information on:
1. Recent developments in shale gas production and its economic impacts
2. Current industrial practices for olefin production 
3. Latest technological advancements in dehydrogenation processes
4. Economic and sustainability challenges facing these technologies
5. Areas of ongoing research and development in the field

The given literature lacks this broader context and industry-wide perspective needed to answer the question comprehensively.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献中没有关于页岩气生产等近期经济因素及其对烯烃生产中脱氢技术的影响的信息。该文档主要集中讨论了一项关于异丁烷脱氢的碳膜反应器的具体研究,但并未涉及该领域更广泛的经济趋势或技术进步。因此,无法根据提供的文本直接回答这个问题。

要正确回答这个问题,需要以下方面的信息:
1. 页岩气生产的最新发展及其经济影响
2. 烯烃生产的当前工业实践
3. 脱氢工艺的最新技术进步
4. 这些技术面临的经济和可持续性挑战
5. 该领域正在进行的研究和开发领域

所给文献缺乏回答该问题所需的更广泛背景和行业整体视角。
