<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain information about recent economic factors like shale gas production or their influence on dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production. The text focuses on a specific study of propane dehydrogenation using molybdenum-based catalytic membranes, but does not discuss broader industry trends, economic factors, or recent technological advancements in the field. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the given document.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain information about recent economic factors like shale gas production or their influence on dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production. The document focuses specifically on propane dehydrogenation using molybdenum-based catalytic membranes, but does not discuss broader economic trends or compare different dehydrogenation technologies. It also does not address current limitations or areas for improvement in industrial dehydrogenation processes more generally. The text is narrowly focused on reporting experimental results for a specific membrane reactor setup, rather than providing an overview of the olefin production industry or economic factors affecting it.
