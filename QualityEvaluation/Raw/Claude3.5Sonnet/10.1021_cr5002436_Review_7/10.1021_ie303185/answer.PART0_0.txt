[1] "As an example, BASF built a 350 kt/year plant in Tarragona (Spain) in 2004 based on the Oleflex process. In addition, the rise of shale gas has favored the use of propane as raw material, and several companies (Dow, Formosa Plastics, Enterprise Products) have announced new plants for 600700 kt/year each."

The surge in shale gas production has significantly influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. It has made propane more readily available as a raw material, leading to increased interest in propane dehydrogenation processes. This is evidenced by several major companies announcing new large-scale plants with capacities of 600-700 kt/year each.

Key technological advancements include the development of more efficient catalysts, such as PtSn/MgAl2O4, which shows lower coking tendency compared to previous catalysts. The use of novel reactor configurations like the Two-Zone Fluidized Bed Reactor (TZFBR) and its combination with palladium membranes (TZFBR+MB) has also improved process efficiency and stability.

Current limitations include the need for frequent catalyst regeneration due to coking, and the temperature limitations of palladium membranes used for hydrogen removal. The operating temperature range of palladium membranes is different from the desirable reaction temperature range for catalytic propane dehydrogenation.

Areas for improvement include developing new palladium alloy membranes that can operate at higher temperatures to better align with the optimal reaction conditions. Additionally, further research into catalysts with even lower coking tendencies and improved selectivity could enhance the overall process efficiency and sustainability.

To improve industrial viability, focus should be placed on scaling up the TZFBR and TZFBR+MB technologies, optimizing the regeneration process, and developing more durable and cost-effective membranes for hydrogen separation. Addressing these challenges could lead to more efficient, sustainable, and economically viable olefin production processes.

页岩气生产的激增对烯烃生产中脱氢技术的发展和采用产生了重大影响。它使丙烷作为原料更容易获得，从而增加了对丙烷脱氢工艺的兴趣。这一点从几家大公司宣布新建年产能为60-70万吨的大型工厂可以看出。

关键的技术进步包括开发了更高效的催化剂，如PtSn/MgAl2O4，与之前的催化剂相比，它显示出较低的结焦趋势。使用新型反应器配置，如两区流化床反应器（TZFBR）及其与钯膜的组合（TZFBR+MB），也提高了工艺效率和稳定性。

当前的限制包括由于结焦需要频繁进行催化剂再生，以及用于氢气去除的钯膜的温度限制。钯膜的操作温度范围与催化丙烷脱氢的理想反应温度范围不同。

需要改进的领域包括开发可在更高温度下操作的新型钯合金膜，以更好地与最佳反应条件保持一致。此外，对结焦趋势更低和选择性更高的催化剂进行进一步研究可以提高整体工艺效率和可持续性。

为了提高工业可行性，应该关注TZFBR和TZFBR+MB技术的规模扩大，优化再生过程，并开发更耐用和成本效益更高的氢气分离膜。解决这些挑战可能会导致更高效、更可持续和更具经济可行性的烯烃生产工艺。
