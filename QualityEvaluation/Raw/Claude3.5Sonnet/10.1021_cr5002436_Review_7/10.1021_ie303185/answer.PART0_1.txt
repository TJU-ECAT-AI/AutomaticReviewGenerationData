[1] "Currently, most propylene is obtained as ethylene byproduct. The propylene consumption is increasing faster than ethylene consumption; therefore, new ways to produce propylene must be developed."

[2] "As an example, BASF built a 350 kt/year plant in Tarragona (Spain) in 2004 based on the Oleflex process. In addition, the rise of shale gas has favored the use of propane as raw material, and several companies (Dow, Formosa Plastics, Enterprise Products) have announced new plants for 600700 kt/year each."

The surge in shale gas production has significantly influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. The increased availability of propane as a raw material from shale gas has led to several companies announcing new large-scale plants for propylene production through dehydrogenation. This trend is driven by the growing demand for propylene, which is outpacing ethylene consumption growth.

Key technological advancements include the development of more efficient catalysts, such as PtSn/MgAl2O4, which shows lower coking tendency, and novel reactor designs like the Two-Zone Fluidized Bed Reactor (TZFBR) with palladium membranes. These innovations aim to address current limitations such as catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and thermodynamic equilibrium constraints.

Areas for improvement include developing palladium alloy membranes that can operate at higher temperatures to better match the optimal reaction temperature range for propane dehydrogenation. Additionally, further research is needed to enhance catalyst stability, increase propylene selectivity, and reduce energy consumption to improve the overall efficiency and sustainability of the process.

To enhance industrial viability, future work should focus on scaling up these advanced reactor designs, optimizing process conditions for continuous operation, and integrating these technologies with existing petrochemical infrastructure. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for meeting the growing demand for propylene while improving the economic and environmental performance of olefin production processes.

页岩气产量的激增显著影响了烯烃生产中脱氢技术的发展和采用。页岩气提供的丙烷原料增加，导致多家公司宣布建设新的大规模丙烯生产装置。这一趋势由丙烯需求增长超过乙烯消费增长所驱动。

关键技术进步包括开发更高效的催化剂，如PtSn/MgAl2O4，它显示出较低的结焦趋势，以及新型反应器设计，如带钯膜的两区流化床反应器（TZFBR）。这些创新旨在解决当前的限制，如由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活和热力学平衡限制。

需要改进的领域包括开发能在更高温度下运行的钯合金膜，以更好地匹配丙烷脱氢的最佳反应温度范围。此外，还需要进一步研究来提高催化剂稳定性，增加丙烯选择性，并减少能源消耗，以提高整个过程的效率和可持续性。

为提高工业可行性，未来的工作应集中在扩大这些先进反应器设计的规模，优化连续运行的工艺条件，并将这些技术与现有的石化基础设施整合。解决这些挑战对于满足日益增长的丙烯需求，同时改善烯烃生产过程的经济和环境性能至关重要。
