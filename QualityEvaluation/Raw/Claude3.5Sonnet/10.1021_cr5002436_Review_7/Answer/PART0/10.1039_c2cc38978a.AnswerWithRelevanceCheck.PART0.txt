          [1] "This process is of renewed interest due to the recent boom in shale gas exploitation and the increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for the production of plastics."

[2] "Rapid deactivation is one of the disadvantages related to supported chromia catalysts. High reaction temperatures and low pressures used for the dehydrogenation reaction are optimal conditions for coke formation, which can be followed over time."

[3] "With increasing temperatures, conversion of propane increases, while selectivity towards propylene drops as cracking of reaction products becomes more prevalent."

          The surge in shale gas production has renewed interest in propane dehydrogenation processes for producing propylene, driven by increased availability of propane from shale gas and growing demand for propylene relative to ethylene in plastics manufacturing.

Key technological advancements include:
1. Development of operando spectroscopy techniques (e.g., UV-Vis) to monitor catalyst performance and deactivation in real-time under industrial conditions.
2. Improved understanding of catalyst behavior and deactivation mechanisms through in-situ characterization techniques.

Current limitations and challenges include:
1. Rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, favored by high temperatures and low pressures used in the process.
2. Trade-off between propane conversion and propylene selectivity at higher temperatures.
3. Endothermic nature of the reaction requiring efficient heat management strategies.

Areas for improvement include:
1. Developing more coke-resistant and thermally stable catalysts.
2. Optimizing reaction conditions to balance conversion and selectivity.
3. Implementing better process monitoring and control systems.
4. Enhancing catalyst regeneration processes and extending catalyst lifetime.
5. Integrating dehydrogenation processes with downstream operations more efficiently.
6. Refining in-situ characterization techniques for deeper insights into catalyst behavior under industrial conditions.
7. Addressing the endothermic nature of the reaction through improved heat management strategies.

These improvements are necessary to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of propane dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production.
