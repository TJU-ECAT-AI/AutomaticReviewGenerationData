[1] "This process is of renewed interest due to the recent boom in shale gas exploitation and the increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for the production of plastics."

[2] "Rapid deactivation is one of the disadvantages related to supported chromia catalysts. High reaction temperatures and low pressures used for the dehydrogenation reaction are optimal conditions for coke formation, which can be followed over time."

[3] "With increasing temperatures, conversion of propane increases, while selectivity towards propylene drops as cracking of reaction products becomes more prevalent."

[1] "Additionally, the recent surge in shale gas production has rendered the cost of natural gas very economical as compared to that of crude oil. Therefore, alternative methods for obtaining olefins, dehydrogenation and MTO, have become very competitive relative to more traditional methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking."

[2] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts."

[3] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."

[4] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."

[5] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."

[6] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

"Currently, most propylene is obtained as ethylene byproduct. The propylene consumption is increasing faster than ethylene consumption; therefore, new ways to produce propylene must be developed. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation is one of the most promising paths to produce propylene."

"As an example, BASF built a 350 kt/year plant in Tarragona (Spain) in 2004 based on the Oleflex process. In addition, the rise of shale gas has favored the use of propane as raw material, and several companies (Dow, Formosa Plastics, Enterprise Products) have announced new plants for 600700 kt/year each."

"Main limitations of these reactors are related to the adaptation between the membrane and the reactor as well as chemical and physical membrane resistance."

"One limitation of this kind of membrane is its maximum work temperature, around 600 C, in order not to damage the thin Pd layer."
