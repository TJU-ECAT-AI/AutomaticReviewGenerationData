[1] "The samples obtained were characterized by thermal analysis (DTA/TGA), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The textural properties of the catalysts were studied through N2 sorption isotherms measured at 77 K."

[2] "Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) photomicrographs were obtained in a Carl Zeiss DSM 950 microscope, at 30 kV/50 mA and 9-mm working distance."

[3] "The estimation of unit cell constant by Bragg law from tetragonal phase of DRX patterns is reported in Table 1 for our samples. Eqs. (1) and (2) were used to calculate the unit cell constant (a in Eq. (2))."

[4] "Unit cell constant of doping samples are slightly higher than the pure zirconia sample (Z). Then, we assume that the doping agents are not inside the zirconia structure."

The study employed a comprehensive set of characterization methods to analyze the doped zirconia catalysts:

1. Thermal analysis (DTA/TGA) was used to study the thermal behavior and phase transitions.

2. FT-IR spectroscopy provided information on chemical bonds and functional groups.

3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) allowed for crystal structure determination and phase identification.

4. N2 sorption isotherms were used to study textural properties like surface area and pore structure.

5. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed morphology and particle size.

6. Unit cell constant calculations from XRD data helped assess dopant incorporation.

These techniques collectively addressed challenges in establishing relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and catalytic performance. However, the study did not conclusively demonstrate homogeneous dopant distribution or rule out all alternative explanations. The slight increase in unit cell constants suggested that dopants may not be fully incorporated into the zirconia structure. To more comprehensively verify dopant incorporation and distribution, additional techniques like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for surface composition analysis or transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with elemental mapping could have been beneficial.

该研究采用了一套全面的表征方法来分析掺杂的氧化锆催化剂：

1. 热分析(DTA/TGA)用于研究热行为和相变。

2. FT-IR光谱提供了化学键和官能团的信息。

3. X射线衍射(XRD)允许进行晶体结构测定和相鉴定。

4. N2吸附等温线用于研究比表面积和孔结构等织构性质。

5. 扫描电子显微镜(SEM)揭示了形态和粒度。

6. 从XRD数据计算晶胞常数有助于评估掺杂剂的掺入。

这些技术共同解决了在建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能之间关系方面的挑战。然而，该研究并未conclusively证明掺杂剂分布均匀或排除所有其他解释。晶胞常数的slight增加表明掺杂剂可能未完全掺入氧化锆结构。为了更全面地验证掺杂剂的掺入和分布，额外的技术如X射线光电子能谱(XPS)用于表面成分分析或带有元素mapping的透射电子显微镜(TEM)可能会有益。
