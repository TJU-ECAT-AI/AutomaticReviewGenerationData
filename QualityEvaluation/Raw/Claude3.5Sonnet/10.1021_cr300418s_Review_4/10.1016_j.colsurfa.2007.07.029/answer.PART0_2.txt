[1] "The samples obtained were characterized by thermal analysis (DTA/TGA), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The textural properties of the catalysts were studied through N2 sorption isotherms measured at 77 K."

[2] "Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) photomicrographs were obtained in a Carl Zeiss DSM 950 microscope, at 30 kV/50 mA and 9-mm working distance."

[3] "The estimation of unit cell constant by Bragg law from tetragonal phase of DRX patterns is reported in Table 1 for our samples. Eqs. (1) and (2) were used to calculate the unit cell constant (a in Eq. (2))."

[4] "Unit cell constant of doping samples are slightly higher than the pure zirconia sample (Z). Then, we assume that the doping agents are not inside the zirconia structure."

Comprehensive characterization methods crucial for verifying dopant incorporation and distribution in metal oxide catalysts include:

1. Thermal analysis (DTA/TGA) to study crystallization and phase transformations
2. Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) to analyze chemical bonds and functional groups
3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine crystalline phases and structural changes
4. N2 sorption isotherms to evaluate textural properties like surface area and porosity
5. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine morphology and particle size
6. Unit cell constant calculations from XRD data to infer dopant incorporation

These techniques address challenges in establishing relationships between dopants, structure, and catalytic performance by providing complementary information on composition, crystal structure, surface properties, and morphology. However, the study notes limitations in conclusively determining dopant location, as slight increases in unit cell constants led to the assumption that dopants were not inside the zirconia structure. To rule out alternative explanations, additional techniques like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for surface composition or transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for detailed structural analysis could be beneficial.

验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂成功掺入和均匀分布的关键综合表征方法包括：

1. 热分析（DTA/TGA）用于研究结晶和相变过程
2. 红外光谱（FT-IR）用于分析化学键和官能团
3. X射线衍射（XRD）用于确定晶相和结构变化
4. 氮气吸附等温线用于评估比表面积和孔隙度等织构特性
5. 扫描电子显微镜（SEM）用于观察形貌和颗粒大小
6. 由XRD数据计算晶胞常数以推断掺杂剂的掺入情况

这些技术通过提供成分、晶体结构、表面性质和形貌等互补信息，解决了建立掺杂剂、结构和催化性能之间关系的挑战。然而，研究指出在确定掺杂剂位置方面存在局限性，因为晶胞常数的轻微增加导致假设掺杂剂不在氧化锆结构内部。为排除其他解释，可以采用X射线光电子能谱（XPS）分析表面成分或透射电子显微镜（TEM）进行详细结构分析等额外技术。
