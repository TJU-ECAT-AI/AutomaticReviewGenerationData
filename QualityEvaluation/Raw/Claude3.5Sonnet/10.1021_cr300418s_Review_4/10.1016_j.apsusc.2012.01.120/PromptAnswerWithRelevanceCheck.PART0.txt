[1] "NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents were prepared by a modified sol–gel method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning/high-resolution transmission electron microscope (SEM/HRTEM), BET surface area analysis, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and O2 temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD)."

[2] "XPS measurements were performed to obtain information about the oxidation state and chemical environment of the elements on the surface of NiZrO nanoparticles."

[3] "The XPS results clearly indicate that the chemical valence of nickel and zirconium ion on the surface has distinct variation for NiZrO compared with that of pure NiO or ZrO2 nanoparticles. It further confirms that there is a strong interaction between Zr and Ni, which may have a strong effect on the catalytic performance."

[2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and the chemical environment of the catalysts, indicating the existence of strong interaction between Ni and Zr."

[3] "The cell parameters variation was calculated by the peak positions of NiO-like phase by Debye–Scherrer method. The results, listed in Table 1, show that the cell parameter of the catalysts increased with the increasing Zr content up to 10%. Such increase indicates that larger Zr4+ ions (0.72 Å) could enter the lattice of nickel oxide and substitute Ni2+ (0.69 Å) sites, which results in lattice distortion."

[4] "XPS measurements were performed to obtain information about the oxidation state and chemical environment of the elements on the surface of NiZrO nanoparticles."

Compared with pure NiO, the temperature was increased approximately 125◦C because of a weak interaction at the interface of NiO/ZrO2."
