[1] "NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents were prepared by a modified sol–gel method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning/high-resolution transmission electron microscope (SEM/HRTEM), BET surface area analysis, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and O2 temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD)."

[2] "XPS measurements were performed to obtain information about the oxidation state and chemical environment of the elements on the surface of NiZrO nanoparticles."

[3] "The XPS results clearly indicate that the chemical valence of nickel and zirconium ion on the surface has distinct variation for NiZrO compared with that of pure NiO or ZrO2 nanoparticles. It further confirms that there is a strong interaction between Zr and Ni, which may have a strong effect on the catalytic performance."

[4] "Based on the characterization results of TPR, XRD, and XPS, it can be found that there is a strong interaction between Ni and Zr, which influences the physicochemical property and consequently the behavior of catalyst."

The comprehensive characterization methods crucial for verifying successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include:

1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) to analyze crystal structure and detect any new phases or lattice changes.

2. Scanning/high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (SEM/HRTEM) to observe particle morphology and size distribution.

3. BET surface area analysis to measure specific surface area changes.

4. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) to study reducibility changes.

5. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to examine surface composition, oxidation states, and chemical environment.

6. O2 temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD) to investigate oxygen species distribution.

These techniques address the challenges in establishing relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and catalytic performance by:

1. Providing evidence of dopant incorporation through lattice parameter changes (XRD) and surface composition analysis (XPS).

2. Revealing structural modifications like particle size and morphology changes (SEM/HRTEM).

3. Demonstrating physicochemical property changes such as reducibility (H2-TPR) and oxygen species distribution (O2-TPD).

4. Offering insights into surface chemical states and interactions between dopant and host material (XPS).

By combining these methods, researchers can rule out alternative explanations and establish clear links between dopant incorporation, structural/electronic changes, and enhanced catalytic performance. The complementary nature of these techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst system.
