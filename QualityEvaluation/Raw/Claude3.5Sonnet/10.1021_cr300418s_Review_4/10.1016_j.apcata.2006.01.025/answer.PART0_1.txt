Several comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts:

1. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): Used to estimate the surface composition and relative atomic ratios of elements.

2. Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS): Employed to examine the formation of solid solutions and provide direct evidence of atomic interactions.

3. X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES): Used to monitor changes in oxidation states and verify surface reduction processes.

4. Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR): Conducted to analyze reduction behavior and identify changes in reduction temperatures.

5. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS): Utilized for in situ measurements of surface species and their reactivity.

These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on surface composition, atomic interactions, oxidation states, reduction behavior, and surface reactivity. By combining these methods, researchers can rule out alternative explanations and obtain a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst structure and its relationship to performance.
