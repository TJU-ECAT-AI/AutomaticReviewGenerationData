[1] "XPS results, normalized to subtract out the signal from carbon, are depicted in Fig. 1AC and Table 2. The results are for the binary oxides prior to loading of metal promoter."

[2] "The possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia was further explored with EXAFS. EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively."

[3] "It is strongly suggested, therefore, from the EXAFS results, that a solid solution was, to a measurable degree, formed."

[4] "To verify that a true facilitation in the reduction of the ceria component occurred, XANES was employed, and results are depicted in Fig. 4A and B."

[5] "Moving to the analysis of DRIFTS, Fig. 5AC show that, after the surface reduction process, adsorption of CO leads to reaction with bridging OH groups to produce surface formate bands, in agreement with earlier studies."

[6] "Assuming a first order decay of the formate, we estimated the first order rate constant based on 0.15-life (i.e. 85% formate decomposition) results. The total active sites, based on the initial formate intensities, decreases with Zr addition (Table 4). However, the rate of their decomposition, passes through a maximum at 50% Zr addition."

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying successful dopant incorporation and distribution in metal oxide catalysts include:

1. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): Used to determine surface composition and relative atomic ratios of elements.

2. Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS): Employed to verify solid solution formation and provide direct evidence of metal-metal interactions.

3. X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES): Used to monitor changes in oxidation states and verify facilitation of reduction processes.

4. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS): Applied to analyze surface species, such as formates, and their decomposition kinetics.

5. Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR): Used to study reduction behavior and temperature shifts upon doping.

6. Catalytic activity tests: Performed to correlate structural changes with enhanced performance.

These techniques address challenges in establishing structure-performance relationships by:

1. Providing complementary information on bulk and surface properties.
2. Allowing in-situ monitoring of structural changes and reaction intermediates.
3. Enabling quantification of active sites and their reactivity.
4. Correlating spectroscopic data with catalytic performance.

By combining these methods, researchers can rule out alternative explanations and build a comprehensive understanding of how dopant incorporation affects catalyst structure and performance at multiple scales.
