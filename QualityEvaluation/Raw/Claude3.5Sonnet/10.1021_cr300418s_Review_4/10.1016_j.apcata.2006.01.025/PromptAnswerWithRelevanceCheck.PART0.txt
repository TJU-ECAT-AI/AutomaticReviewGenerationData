[1] "XPS results, normalized to subtract out the signal from carbon, are depicted in Fig. 1AC and Table 2. The results are for the binary oxides prior to loading of metal promoter."

[2] "EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively."

[3] "To verify that a true facilitation in the reduction of the ceria component occurred, XANES was employed, and results are depicted in Fig. 4A and B."

[4] "Moving to the analysis of DRIFTS, Fig. 5AC show that, after the surface reduction process, adsorption of CO leads to reaction with bridging OH groups to produce surface formate bands, in agreement with earlier studies."

[5] "Assuming a first order decay of the formate, we estimated the first order rate constant based on 0.15-life (i.e. 85% formate decomposition) results. The total active sites, based on the initial formate intensities, decreases with Zr addition (Table 4). However, the rate of their decomposition, passes through a maximum at 50% Zr addition."

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying successful dopant incorporation and distribution in metal oxide catalysts include:

1. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): Used to estimate surface composition and relative atomic ratios of elements.

2. Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS): Provides direct evidence of solid solution formation and atomic interactions between dopant and host atoms.

3. X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES): Verifies changes in oxidation states and reduction behavior of the catalyst components.

4. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS): Analyzes surface species formation and reactivity, such as formate groups.

5. Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR): Examines reducibility changes with dopant addition.

6. Catalytic activity measurements: Correlates structural changes with performance enhancements.

These techniques address challenges by:

1. Providing complementary information on bulk and surface properties.
