The study employed a comprehensive set of characterization methods to verify dopant incorporation and examine structural changes in the metal oxide catalysts:

1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to estimate surface composition and relative atomic ratios of Ce and Zr.

2. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy provided direct evidence of solid solution formation by revealing ZrCe interactions.

3. X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) was used to monitor surface reduction processes and oxidation states of Ce.

4. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) helped analyze reduction behavior of the catalysts.

5. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was employed to examine formate species on catalyst surfaces.

These techniques, when used in combination, provided a multi-faceted view of dopant incorporation, structural changes, and surface properties. By correlating these results with catalytic performance data, the researchers could establish relationships between dopant presence, structural modifications, and enhanced activity while ruling out alternative explanations. The use of multiple complementary techniques strengthened the validity of their conclusions about the role of Zr doping in enhancing catalyst performance.

该研究采用了一套综合的表征方法来验证掺杂剂的掺入情况并检查金属氧化物催化剂的结构变化：

1. 使用X射线光电子能谱(XPS)来估计表面成分和Ce与Zr的相对原子比。

2. 扩展X射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)光谱通过揭示ZrCe相互作用，直接证明了固溶体的形成。

3. 使用X射线吸收近边结构(XANES)光谱监测表面还原过程和Ce的氧化态。

4. 程序升温还原(TPR)有助于分析催化剂的还原行为。

5. 采用漫反射红外傅里叶变换光谱(DRIFTS)检查催化剂表面的甲酸盐物种。

这些技术结合使用，提供了对掺杂剂掺入、结构变化和表面性质的多方面视角。通过将这些结果与催化性能数据相关联，研究人员能够建立掺杂剂存在、结构修饰和活性增强之间的关系，同时排除其他解释。使用多种互补技术增强了他们关于Zr掺杂在提高催化剂性能方面作用的结论的有效性。
