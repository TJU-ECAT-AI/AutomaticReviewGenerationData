Abstract
The structural and electronic properties of Ce1xNixO2y nanosystems prepared by a reverse microemulsion method were characterized with synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional calculations. The Ce1xNixO2y systems adopt a lattice with a fluorite-type structure with an acute local order where Ni displays a strongly distorted (oxygen) nearest-neighbor coordination and the presence of Ni atoms as first cation distances, pointing to the existence of NiONi entities embedded into the ceria lattice. A Ni  Ce exchange within the CeO2 leads to a charge redistribution and the appearance of O vacancies. The NiO bonds in Ce1xNixO2y are more difficult to reduce than the bonds in pure NiO. The specific structural configuration of Ni inside the mixed-metal oxide leads to a unique catalyst with a high activity for the water gas shift (CO + H2O  H2 + CO2) reaction and a simultaneous reduction of the methanation activity of nickel. Characterization results indicate that small particles of metallic Ni at the interface position of a ceria network may be the key for high WGS activity and that the formatecarbonate route is operative for the production of hydrogen.

I Introduction
Ceria (CeO2) is an oxide with important applications in many areas of chemistry, materials science, and physics. (1-3) In its most stable phase, bulk CeO2 adopts a fluorite-type crystal structure in which each metal cation is surrounded by eight oxygen atoms. (1, 4)
The performance of ceria in catalytic processes and fuel cells can be enhanced by doping this oxide with a second metal (Zr, Ca, Cu, Tb, La, Mn, etc.). (1, 3, 5-7) With respect to single-metal oxides, the chemical behavior of mixed-metal oxides may be different as a consequence of several factors. (1, 8-10) At a structural level, a dopant can introduce stress into the lattice of an oxide host, inducing in this way the formation of defects to fulfill charge neutrality and modifying chemical reactivity. On the other hand, the lattice of the oxide host can impose on the dopant element nontypical coordination modes with a subsequent perturbation in the dopant chemical properties. Furthermore, the combination of two metals in an oxide matrix can produce materials with novel structural or electronic properties that can lead to superior catalytic activity or selectivity. (11-13) Metal  metal or metal  oxygen  metal interactions in mixed-metal oxides can give electronic states not seen in single-metal oxides. (9-11) For practical and academic reasons, (1, 3, 5-7) it is very important to gain a better understanding of the behavior of metal-doped CeO2.
In this study, we investigate the structural and chemical properties of nanoparticles of Ce1xNixO2y solid solutions prepared following a novel procedure. (14-16) Because the dopant is incorporated into a fluorite-type crystal structure that is very different from the rock-salt structure of NiO, (4) it is not clear what to expect for the physical and chemical properties of Ce1xNixO2y. In principle, a Ni cation embedded in a fluorite lattice can have up to eight oxygen neighbors versus six in NiO. Moreover, Ni usually does not adopt formal oxidation states of +4 and +3 like Ce does. These differences open the possibility for substantial structural perturbations (stress, point and line defects, O vacancies) (1, 17) within the ceria lattice.
Ni-based catalysts are widely employed in many industrial processes, such as the reforming of alcohols, hydrogenation reactions, hydrocracking, and also oxidation processes. (18, 19) Previous studies have addressed the behavior of NiO/CeO2 or Ni/CeO2 systems as catalysts for the water gas shift reaction (WGS, CO + H2O  H2 + CO2). (20, 21) The nickelceria system has proven to be quite active especially when compared to catalysts that contain other noble metals. The general agreement on the reaction mechanism is that reduced nickel interacts with CO while partially reduced CeOx species dissociate water. (20, 21) One disadvantage of these Ni systems is catalyst deactivation due to the formation of C deposits because Ni is also very active in the methanation reaction. (22) As compared to the Ni/CeO2 or NiO-CeO2 systems, the Ce1xNix O2y catalysts should have Ni species strongly interacting with the Ce or more likely Ni cations occupying Ce cations lattice positions. A strong metalsupport interaction effect (SMSI) has been reported for the Ni/CeO2 system. (23, 24) Upon reduction in hydrogen, at temperatures of 500 C or higher, metallic nickel particles were flattened, wetting the ceria surface, or were encapsulated by the oxide support. (24) This intermixing should be less pronounced than in a Ce1xNixO2y solid solution where individual Ni cations are incorporated into a well-defined oxide lattice.
In this study, the structural and electronic properties of Ce1xNixO2y are examined using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and density functional (DF) calculations. The behavior of Ce1xNixO2y under WGS reaction conditions is monitored using in situ time-resolved XRD, XAFS, and diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DR-FTIR). Being able to follow the structural changes with such a wide variety of characterization techniques will help to identify the active phase for the WGS reaction.
II Experimental and Theoretical Methods
A Sample Preparation
The NiO/CeO2 catalyst was prepared by employing reverse microemulsions containing n-heptane, Triton-X-100, and n-hexanol as an organic solvent, surfactant, and cosurfactant, respectively, in amounts similar to those reported previously. (25) The required amount of Ni(NO3)2 was dissolved in distilled water and added to the former in order to form the reverse microemulsion. Simultaneously, another microemulsion of similar characteristics was prepared containing, dissolved in its aqueous phase, the required amount of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH). After 1 h of stirring the two microemulsions, the TMAH-containing one was added to the metal-containing one, and it was left for a period of 24 h with continuous stirring in order to complete the precipitation reaction. The resulting solid was then separated by centrifugation and decantation, rinsed with methanol, and dried overnight at 100 C, and the resulting powder was calcined at 500 C for 2 h under air. As measured by ICP-AES, the sample atomic Ni/Ce percentages differ from nominal ones by 2% in the two compositions essayed and contain 10 and 20 atom % of Ni (cation total basis). BET area values were 136.1 (Ni/Ce = 10:90) and 121.7 (Ni/Ce = 20:80) m2 g1.
B X-ray Diffraction
In-situ time-resolved X-ray diffraction (TR-XRD) experiments were carried out on beamline X7B of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The sample (5 mg) was loaded into a glass or quartz reactor with a diameter of 1 mm, which was attached to a flow system. (26, 27) A small resistance heater was wrapped around the capillary, and the temperature was monitored with a 0.1 mm chromelalumel thermocouple placed in the capillary near the sample. Two-dimensional powder patterns were collected with a Mar345 image plate detector, and the powder diffraction rings were integrated using the FIT2D code. (28) The instrument parameters (ThompsonCoxHastings profile coefficients) were derived from the fit of a LaB6 reference pattern. Rietveld profile refinements were performed with the aid of GSAS software. (29, 30) The series of powder patterns was refined by sequential analysis where the starting model is based on the earlier powder pattern. Diffraction patterns were collected over the catalyst during the WGS reaction, reduction in 5% CO/He, and oxidation in 5% O2/He. The WGS reaction was carried out with a stepped temperature program from room temperature to 500 C, with 2 h soaks at every 100 C beyond 200 C amid a 1% CO and 99% He gas mixture flow rate of 10 mL/min at a space velocity of 4000 h1 (volumetric feed flow rate/catalytic bed volume). This gas mixture passed through a water bubbler (room temperature) before entering the reactor. The relative ratio of water vapor to CO pressures in the gas mixture was 3. Samples were also reduced in a 5% CO/He flow heating up to 500 C at a rate of 1.6 C/min.
C XAFS
Ni K edge in situ XANES spectra were collected at beamline X18B of the NSLS under similar operational conditions as those for the TR-XRD experiments. The same cell was used for the XANES experiments as that for the in situ XRD, except that the sample was loaded into a Kapton capillary and heated with a hot air blower. The X-ray absorption spectra were taken repeatedly in the fluorescence-yield mode using a passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS) detector cooled with circulating water. The XANES data were then analyzed using the Athena program. (31, 32)
The relative product concentrations from both TR-XRD and TR-XANES experiments were measured with a 0100 amu quadruple mass spectrometer (QMS, Stanford Research Systems). A portion of the exit gas flow passed through a leak valve and into the QMS vacuum chamber. QMS signals at mass-to-charge ratios of 2(H2), 4(He), 16(O,CH4), 17(OH), 18(H2O), 28(CO), 32(O2), and 44(CO2) were monitored and recorded during the experiments.
D Raman Spectroscopy and DRIFT
Raman spectra were acquired with an iHR320 Horiba Jobin-Ybon spectrometer using a He:Ne laser (633 nm). In-situ DRIFT analysis of the samples under WGS conditions was carried out using a Bruker Equinox 55 FTIR spectrometer fitted with an MCT detector and a Harrick DRIFT cell. Samples of ca. 50 mg were exposed to reaction conditions as detailed in the X-ray Diffraction section.
E Density Functional Calculations
The first-principles DF calculations reported in section for model Ce1xNixO2y systems were performed using the VASP5.2.2 code with projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials. (33) VWN spin-polarized calculations were performed within the general gradient approximation (GCA) using the PW91 functional (34) in a DFT + U approach (where U is a Hubbard-like term describing the on-site Coulomb interactions). (35) Following previous studies, values of 5.0 and 6.3 eV have been chosen for the U parameters of Ce (11, 12, 36) and Ni, (37) respectively. Our main objective in these calculations was to see variations in the ceria lattice dimensions after replacing Ce cations with Ni cations and after the creation of O vacancies. To better understand the electronic properties of the Ce1xNixO2y mixed oxides, the net atomic charges in the metal cations and oxygen anions were obtained using a topological analysis of the charge density. (38)
III Results and Discussion
A Characterization of Ce1xNixO2y Mixed Oxides: Solubility of Ni
Characterization of the as-prepared samples, Ce0.9Ni0.1O2y and Ce0.8Ni0.2O2y, by XRD showed a major contribution from a CeO2 fluorite-type structure (39) (see Figure 1). The Ce0.9Ni0.1O2y system did not show any clear peaks that could be attributed to NiO, (40) although the asymmetry of some ceria peaks near NiO positions can be noticed (see below). In the sample with a 20% Ni content, a weak signal arising from the NiO diffraction pattern could be observed. Rietveld refinement analysis gave a molar fraction of 0.08 for the nickel oxide phase, a value much lower than the nominal Ni content. Thus, only a minor fraction of the Ni present in the sample is forming a periodic structure of NiO. The rest of the Ni is probably forming a solid solution in the CeO2 lattice. The XRD study suggests that the limit of solubility for a Ce  Ni exchange in ceria is in the range of 1012%. The homogeneity and structural properties of the CeNi solid solution(s) are discussed below with the help of other techniques.
Figure 1
Figure 1. XRD patterns of Ni0.2Ce0.8O2y and Ni0.1Ce0.9O2y mixed-metal oxides.
The calcined samples were also analyzed by XAFS. An analysis of the Ni K edge XANES region displayed in Figure 2 shows that Ni is in a +2 oxidation state. The absorption edge position and spectral features (whiteline intensity) clearly match those of the NiO reference sample. Figure 2b displays a zoom-in view of the Ni s  p/d pre-edge transition. (41) For Ni0.1Ce0.9O2y, where XRD showed the most simple structural situation, we observe that the pre-edge shifted to a lower energy and had increasing intensity with respect to the NiO reference. Both are clear indications of a larger oxygen first coordination number, which may grow from 6 (NiO) to about 8, typical of the cation coordination at the ceria lattice. The 20% Ni sample displays an intermediate behavior, indicating the presence of a NiO phase contribution, as expected from XRD results. The higher intensity with respect to the Ni0.1Ce0.9O2y sample may indicate some additional distortion of the first NiO shell. Figure 3a shows an EXAFS analysis over the k-space of the samples in comparison with a NiO reference. The k-space oscillations of both NiCe mixed oxide samples are almost in phase with the NiO reference, though some subtle deviations can be observed especially at high K values and particularly for the Ni0.1Ce0.9O2y sample. The Fourier transform (FT) gave us the radial distribution of the local neighbors of Ni in the mixed oxide samples (see Figure 3b). The first contribution, around 1.8 Å, corresponds to the NiO first shell bond. In both mixed oxide samples, this first peak is broad and indicates a strongly distorted shell. Both the module and the imaginary part of the FT showed the presence of NiO contributions at shorter distances than the one corresponding to NiO. The FT imaginary part displays an interference characteristic of, at least, two well-differentiated NiO coordination distances. In the 10% Ni sample, the second shell seems to be NiNi but with a strong diminishing intensity. This indicates the formation of NiO clusters with some structural differences with a NiO oxide (particularly important in the NiO first coordination shell) originated by their embedding into a ceria structure. We may thus conclude that the sample where XRD exclusively detected a fluorite-type structure (Ni0.1Ce0.9O2y) is a CeNi solid solution with a characteristic local order, induced by a strongly distorted (with respect to NiO) NiO first shell coordination and a rather limited NiNi coordination at the second shell.

For the sample with a larger nickel content, a larger contribution from the NiO structure can be observed. In this sample, the Ni is partially dissolved into the ceria structure but is also forming an additional nickel oxide phase. As mentioned above, it seems that 20% Ni is above the solubility limit of the Ni into the ceria and whatever nickel species cannot fit end up forming a nickel oxide structure. This result is in agreement with the XRD results, which showed the presence of the NiO phase in the Ni0.2Ce0.8O2y sample.
DF calculations were used to investigate the structural and electronic properties of Ce1xNixO2y systems containing 12.5 and 25% of Ni. Table 1 lists the calculated lattice parameters and Bader charges for different models. In general, a Ce  Ni exchange within CeO2 leads to a clear contraction in the lattice parameters. Because the formal charge on Ni cations is much smaller than that on Ce cations, oxygen vacancies must be introduced into the mixed-metal oxide. The creation of O vacancies produces a lattice expansion (16) that compensates the lattice contraction produced by the Ce  Ni exchange. At the end, the lattice parameters calculated for the CeO2 and Ce1xNixO2y systems are very close, in agreement with trends found by the Rietveld refinement of the corresponding XRD data. The Bader charge seems to decrease for Ce with respect to CeO2 in a modest way, which may indicate charge redistribution mostly by an effect of changes in the OCe distances or by differences when going from Ce  O  Ce to Ce  O  Ni electronic interactions.

The fresh Ce1xNixO2y samples have also been characterized by Raman spectroscopy, and the results showed a strong frequency shift and broadening for the first-order F2g ceria peak located near 460 cm1 (Figure 4). This behavior can be interpreted as a result of the solubility of Ni into the ceria, more concretely, a decrease in the pure ceria domains size and the corresponding energy shift and band broadening due to confinement effects. (42) The shift is similar for the samples containing 10% and 20% Ni, indicating that the solubility limit is closer to 10%. Secondary peaks at ca. 230 and 330 cm1 characteristic of ceria nanostructures are also observed. (42) Contrarily, the broad NiO signal at ca. 520 cm1 cannot be detected, likely due to a shadowing effect by the long tail of the first-order ceria peak. (43)

In brief, the Raman results corroborated the XRD and EXAFS data. From the detailed characterization of the as-prepared materials, one can conclude that, in the Ce0.9Ni0.1O2y sample, the majority of the Ni is forming a solid solution with marked local structural characteristics and no segregated NiO species could be observed by any of the employed techniques. For the Ce0.8Ni0.2O2y sample, the nickel is split into two main species: 60% can be dissolved into the ceria matrix and 40% forms NiO.
B Reaction with H2
The chemical reactivity of the Ce1xNixO2y mixed oxides was tested using reaction with H2 as a probe. Would the embedding of Ni cations in ceria modify their reduction temperature with respect to that in pure NiO? Figure 5 shows TR-XRD data for the reduction of Ni0.2Ce0.8O2y in a mixture of 5% H2/95% He as a function of temperature. At 25 C, one could see the diffraction lines for the fluorite structure of the doped ceria and weak peaks for the rock-salt structure of NiO. The right-side panel in Figure 5 shows the sequential Rietveld refinement of the Ni species mole fraction and CeO2 lattice as a function of temperature (25950 C). We have performed a reference experiment with a commercial bulk NiO sample and heated it under the same flow conditions and temperature rate, finding out that the temperature onset for the reduction of bulk NiO is 290 C (see the inset of Figure 5). Near this temperature, the NiO present in the Ni0.2Ce0.8O2y sample transforms into metallic nickel. From 400 to 700 C, the Ni cations embedded in the ceria lattice are reduced. In the case of the Ni0.1Ce0.9O2y sample, which does not exbibit peaks for NiO in the XRD diffraction, no reduction of the nickel cations was observed at temperatures below 400 C. Thus, NiO bonds in the mixed-metal oxide are substantially stronger than the bonds in pure NiO. They likely gain stability through Ni  O  Ce interface interactions.

Figure 5. (a) TR-XRD patterns for Ni0.2Ce0.8O2y under a 5% H2/He flow as a function of temperature. (b) Sequential Rietveld refinement analysis of the Ni phase fraction and CeO2 lattice parameter.
In Figure 5b, the evolution of the ceria lattice with temperature exhibits a complex pattern. With thermal treatment, an expansion of the lattice is expected (thermal coefficient of ceria nanoparticles is ca. (66.5) × 105  K1), but sudden changes in the slope can be related to chemical processes and, particularly, to the creation of O vacancies with a partial reduction of the Ce4+ ions to Ce3+. (15) Additional processes may be associated with Ni reduction/segregation in our case. As it is shown in Figure 5, two significant changes are produced in the CeO2 lattice expansion. In first place, around 200 C, an abrupt expansion is observed that could be attributed to hydrogen incorporation into the ceria lattice. This process may occur due to the high number of oxygen vacancies as well as the specific local/long-range structural characteristics of the CeNi solid solutions, which may drive hydrogen activation at defect and/or interface sites between the local Ni and Ce moieties present at such phases. No Ni or Ce reduction processes are expected in this region, at least at the beginning. This abrupt expansion finished before appreciable Ni reduction, according to Rietveld results (Figure 5b). The next region displays a slope growth roughly consistent with the thermal expansion expected for a ceria-type lattice, indicating that, first, the NiO phase reduction did not affect the fluorite phase but, also, that lattice Ni reduction apparently happens without (complete) extraction of Ni from the fluorite. This hypothesis needs, however, further analysis. From 700 to 950 C, one can expect a bigger expansion of the ceria lattice due to a bulk Ce4+  Ce3+ transformation. (15) The structural changes observed during sample reduction point to a complex distribution of chemical species and a strong interaction between the nickel cations and ceria lattice.
C Reaction with CO
Before testing the WGS activity of the Ce1xNixO2y mixed-metal oxides, we investigated their interaction with pure CO. The Rietveld analysis of the diffraction data for Ni0.2Ce0.8O2y, taken under a 5% CO/95% He gas mixture and heating from 25 to 500 C, is displayed in Figure 6. The trends for both fluorite and Ni phase partition observables are similar to those obtained for hydrogen reduction. Between 100 and 200 C, an expansion of the ceria lattice is observed. From 250 to 400 C, the NiO is reduced to metallic nickel. However the fraction of Ni0 species is small, making it difficult to obtain consistent trends above 400 C. A very small amount of Ni/NiO could be coming out from the ceria lattice.
Figure 6
Figure 6. (a) TR-XRD patterns of Ni0.2Ce0.8O2y under 5% CO/He as a function of temperature. (b) Sequential Rietveld refinement analysis of the Ni phase fraction and CeO2 lattice parameter.
Figure 7 shows in situ Ni K edge XANES spectra for the Ni0.2Ce0.8O2y and Ni0.1Ce0.9O2y samples reduced under a 5% CO/95% He mixture. Note that the maximum temperature reached for the experiments is 400 C, as limited by the kapton tube used as a reactor. As the temperature is increased, the Ni cations are being reduced. For Ni0.2Ce0.8O2y, the nickel reduction is relatively small at 200 and 300 C and accelerates from 300 to 400 C, probably due to a NiO  Ni transformation (see above). At the end, a significant amount of the nickel remains oxidized, embedded into the ceria lattice. For the Ni0.1Ce0.9 O2y sample, there is also a drop in the intensity of the signal for oxidized nickel from 25 to 400 C. For this sample, the XRD does not show a crystalline NiO phase. Thus, the drop in the signal for oxidized Ni could be due to the reduction of an amorphous phase of NiO (not detected in XRD) or some of the Ni cations embedded in the ceria lattice. Apart form the initial drop, the sample displays, as expected, fewer changes than the Ni0.2Ce0.8O2y one in the region of temperatures explored, due to the absence of a NiO phase.

D Water Gas Shift Activity
Figure 8 shows data for the production of H2, CO2, and CH4 over the Ni0.2Ce0.8O2y and Ni0.1Ce0.9O2y systems after exposing them to a mixture of CO and H2O at elevated temperatures. The temperature program consisted of 30 min ramps and 3 h plateaus for steady-state measurements at 200, 300, 400, and 500 C. As the temperature is raised around 200 C, a small production of CO2 and H2 is observed, but the catalytic activity is not stable. Substantial catalytic activity is seen at 300 C and is very stable with time. In general, nickel particles supported on oxides are well-known catalysts for the formation of methane from CO and H2. (44, 45) As it can be observed in Figure 8, methane production also starts at 300 C but only a tiny amount of methane is formed, indicating that, under the conditions of the catalytic test, the CO methanation reaction is not a competing reaction path. When the temperature is raised, the production of hydrogen diminishes along with the CO2 production; in other words, the samples become less active at temperatures above 300 C. The reason for this deactivation is unclear. It does not seem to be related to a switch to the methanation reaction, because the production of methane is not increased, and apparently is more connected to a specific poisoning of specific surface sites (see below).

Figure 9 displays in situ Ni K edge XANES spectra for the Ni0.2Ce0.8O2y and Ni0.1Ce0.9O2y samples collected in situ during the WGS reaction. These data show subtle changes in the XANES spectra. As in the experiments of Figure 7, there is a decrease in the signal for nickel oxide, but this decrease is not as large as that found after exposure to pure CO. The reactant mixture for the WGS reaction includes a reducing agent (CO) and a mild oxidizing agent (H2O). The presence of water prevents the extensive reduction of the nickel cations. In a set of experiments, we exposed Ni/CeO2 systems to water at temperatures below 400 C and found the formation of NiO.
Figure 9

In-situ time-resolved XRD data for the WGS on the Ni0.2Ce0.8O2y sample is shown in Figure 10 along with the corresponding Rietveld analysis. The diffraction signal is governed by ceria contributions, but the evolution of the solid phases can be quantitative followed by the Rietveld refinement. Figure 10b displays the ceria cell dimension and the mole fraction of both NiO and Ni. The starting material is composed of some NiO (around 12%) and Ni-doped ceria. In the first place, one can observe a large expansion of the ceria lattice achieved when the temperature is raised up to 200 C. It is similar in magnitude to the expansion observed under CO or H2 flow. In the following step, when the temperature is raised to 300 C, a small contribution from metallic nickel appears. The appearance of metallic nickel is not accompanied by a decrease in the mole fraction of NiO, which probably suggest that some nickel species are being segregated from the bulk ceria. This is, in any case, a rather small effect in terms of the Ni percentage involved. It is worth mentioning that the appearance of the metallic nickel phase is correlated to the hydrogen production. Prior to the formation of some Ni0, no WGS activity is obtained. When the temperature is raised to 400 C, the mole fraction of NiO is diminished along with an increase in the Ni phase fraction. Under WGS reaction conditions, it is required that a temperature of 400 C is reached for a significant amount of nickel to be reduced. The activity data show that this structural change is accompanied by a deactivation of the sample. Metallic nickel is known to be active for carbon formation, (44, 45) so it looks like, when the amount of nickel is large enough, carbon deposits may start to block the active sites on the catalysts surface, justifying the modest activity decay observed above 300 C in Figure 8. Finally, at 500 C, more metallic Ni is formed, whereas the amount of NiO practically disappears. Again, the activity data show a subsequent decrease in hydrogen production. Small amounts of metallic Ni dispersed on a Ce1xNixO2y support seems to be the best catalyst for the WGS.

Figure 8 shows the amounts of H2, CO2, and CH4 produced on the Ni0.2Ce0.8O2y catalyst during the WGS reaction.
Figures 11 and 12 show in situ DRIFT data for the WGS on pure ceria and Ce1x NixO2y mixed-metal oxides. Ceria shows the presence of formate species (bands at 2945, 2825, 1510, and 1375 cm1) above 300 C with a concomitant detection of CO2 gas. Formate species are believed to be key intermediates in WGS on ceria-based systems and formed by water dissociation with subsequent reaction of hydroxyl groups and CO. (46) Water dissociation seems to be the rate-limiting step in CeM (M = Cu) solid solutions with similar structural characteristics to our samples. (47)

In the case of NiCe solid solutions, we detected formate species but together with a CH stretch (ca. 3010 cm1), indicating the presence of methane and the additional formation of carbonates. The intensity growth in the region below 1500 cm1 with no concomitant behavior of other IR regions proves the presence of carbonates in CeNi solid solutions. DRIFT results would thus indicate that the formatecarbonate route is active for hydrogen production in the case of CeNi nanomaterials and also that a methane maximum is reached at 300 C, disappearing at higher temperatures, in agreement with the MS results reported in Figure 8. The importance of carbonates as key intermediates in WGS has been recently analyzed, although this is not without debate. (48) Our results would indicate their potential involvement on the activity decrease observed above 300 C and would, therefore, indicate that the presence of metallic Ni clusters with some dimensionality favors the transformation of formate into carbonate species, poisoning some active surface centers. In any case and according to the literature, it is clear that the rate-determining step of the reaction is not only dependent on the specific catalyst used but also on experimental conditions and, particularly, on the gas-phase composition, which drastically changes above 300 C.49 This would suggest that carbonates may play a different role in the WGS reaction above and below this temperature.
IV Summary and Conclusions
A detailed characterization of the NiCe mixed oxides has been performed by XRD, EXAFS, DFT, and Raman studies. XRD shows that the solubility limit of a Ce  Ni exchange in ceria is in the range of 1012%. EXAFS analysis shows a strongly distorted first shell for NiO contributions and NiNi correlations with a diminishing intensity as compared with bulk NiO. In the sample Ni0.1Ce0.9O2y, the majority of the Ni is forming a solid solution, whereas in a sample with a higher Ni content (20%), there is also present a segregated phase of NiO. This result is corroborated by Raman spectroscopy. Density functional studies show that a Ni substitution in the Ce lattice would lead to a significant contraction of the cell dimensions that is compensated by the expansion produced by the oxygen vacancies created in the system to maintain a charge balance.
Results of in situ TR-XRD indicate that the strong Ce  O  Ni interactions present in the mixed-metal oxide delay the reduction of the nickel cations by hydrogen up to temperatures above 400 C. These temperatures are significantly larger than those observed (280300 C) for pure NiO. The hydrogen reduction process of the Ce1x NixO2y mixed-metal oxides is complex and involves the reduction of Ce4+ species to Ce3+ in addition to Ni0 formation. The reactivity of the samples toward CO was also followed by in situ TR-XRD and XANES experiments. Though some Ni reduction was observed, a significant amount of nickel remained embedded in the oxide matrix even after reaction with carbon monoxide at temperatures as high as 500 C.
Finally, the Ce1x NixO2y systems were tested as catalysts for the WGS reaction. In situ characterization of the catalysts during the reaction was performed by XRD, XANES, and DRIFT. The catalytic performance test showed significant hydrogen production at a temperature of 300 C. Methane production is minute throughout the test, ruling out the methanation reaction as a competing route for the WGS reaction. In situ XANES data during the WGS reaction showed a subtle reduction in the nickel oxidation state as the temperature was raised. Sequential Rietveld refinement of the TR-XRD experiment detects the incipient formation of metallic nickel at 300 C (the onset for catalytic activity) and a substantial reduction to the metal at temperatures of 400 and 500 C (correlated with a slight deactivation in the hydrogen production). The in situ DRIFT studies showed the formation of formates, a key intermediate in the WGS reaction, along with carbonates and methane species. At temperatures above 300 C, the formation of carbonate is favored over the formate, providing a route for catalyst deactivation. The active phase for the WGS reaction in the NiCeOx mixed oxide systems is probably small particles of metallic nickel dispersed on a Ce1xNixO2y support. The strong NiCe interaction prevents the formation of bulklike particles of Ni0, therefore, quenching the formation of carbonaceous deposits that would block active sites.
