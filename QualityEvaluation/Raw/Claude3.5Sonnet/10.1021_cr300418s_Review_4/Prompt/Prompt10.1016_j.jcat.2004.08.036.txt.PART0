Abstract
K-doped MoVSb mixed oxides catalysts have been prepared by impregnation of a MoVSbO mixed oxide (previously prepared by
hydrothermal synthesis) with an aqueous solution of potassium nitrate, characterized by XRD, SEM-EDX, EPR, XPS, XANES, and FTIR of
adsorbed NH3, and tested in the selective oxidation of propane and propylene in the 593693 K temperature range. The undoped MoVSbO
catalysts presented a selectivity to acrylic acid lower than 15%, while selectivities to acrylic acid of about 40% can be obtained on K-doped
catalysts. No appreciable differences between undoped and K-doped catalysts are observed in the nature of crystalline phases present in each
case, on the basis of X-ray diffraction analysis. However, important differences in both the oxidation state of surface Sb species (according to
XPS evidence) and the number of acid sites (determined from FTIR of adsorbed NH3) are observed between the undoped and the K-doped
catalysts. The high selectivity to acrylic acid on the K-doped catalysts seems to be related to changes in the acidbase properties of the
catalysts and most particularly to the elimination of (Brnsted) acid sites. In addition, the role of antimony species in activity and selectivity
is also discussed and a reaction network for the partial oxidation reaction is proposed.

1. Introduction
There is an increasing interest in the development of a
process for direct oxidation of propane to acrylic acid as
an alternative to the two-step conventional industrial process
based on the propylene feedstock, which represents approx-
imately 90% of the 1.84 × 106 tons/year of the total capac-
ity of acrylic acid production plants [1,2]. Although a large
number of catalytic systems have been studied, only few cat-
alysts seem to be relatively active and selective [3,4]. This
is the case of undoped and Me-doped VPO oxides [57],
NiMoTePO oxides [8,9], and metal and/or pyridine ex-
changed molybdovanadophosphoric acid [114].

MoVNbTe(Sb) catalysts have been recently proposed as
active and selective in the oxidation of propane to acrylic
acid [1524], but the selectivities achieved on Sb-containing
catalysts [1923] are generally lower than those obtained on
Te-containing catalysts [1518]. Despite their practical in-
terest, few fundamental studies on the nature and catalytic
behavior of MoVSb-based catalysts have been published
[2023]. Although some factors seem to have an important
influence on the selectivity to acrylic acid, such as the cat-
alyst calcination conditions [20,21] or the incorporation of
water in the feed [22], relatively low selectivities to acrylic
acid have been reported.
Characterization results published on MoVSbO [23] and
MoVSbNbO [20,21] catalysts suggest the presence of sev-
eral crystalline phases depending on the chemical compo-
sition, the catalyst preparation procedure, and the calcina-

tion conditions. Sb4Mo10O30 and Sb2Mo10O31 in addition
to Mo5x(V/Nb)xO14 were proposed to be present on sam-
ples prepared by a slurry method and heat-treated at 873 K
in N2 and activated in He or in O2/He mixtures (20% of
O2), although some changes in the DRX were observed de-
pending on the activation procedure [20,21]. (Sb2O)M6O18
and (SbO)2M20O56 (with M = Mo and V) were proposed,
however, in MoVSbO catalysts prepared by hydrothermal
synthesis and activated in air at 643 K for 20 min followed
by a second heat treatment, in pure nitrogen, at 873 K for
2 h [26]. Nevertheless, the similarities of the XRD pat-
terns of the oxides involved and the complexity of the sys-
tems render difficult an unambiguous interpretation of the
diffraction data, and to get additional information, which
may help to elucidate the crystallographic phases, present,
by using other characterization techniques. In this sense,
one of the differences among these crystalline phases is
the Sb oxidation state, which is Sb3+ in Sb4Mo10O30 and
Sb2Mo10O31 [20,25] and Sb3+/Sb5+ in (Sb2O)M6O18 and
(SbO)2M20O56 [26].
MoVSbO catalysts, prepared by hydrothermal synthe-
sis, have also been studied in the partial oxidation of
propane [23]. They present a selectivity to acrylic acid (ca.
6%) lower than that obtained on Te-based catalysts [16,23,
24], although their catalytic performance has partially been
enhanced by grinding the catalyst precursor before the calci-
nation step. However, selectivities to acrylic acid lower than
20% have been reported [23].
Recently, it has been shown that the selectivity to acrylic
acid obtained during the selective oxidation of propane on
MoVSbO catalysts can be improved by the incorporation of
potassium on the catalyst surface [27]. This higher produc-
tion of acrylic acid could be related to the modifications of
the nature and number of acid sites on the catalyst surface
after the incorporation of potassium. However, the role of
each element and the nature of the crystalline phases are still
unclear.
In this paper we will present the characterization and cat-
alytic behavior of undoped and K-doped MoVSbO, in which
the incorporation of potassium has a promoter effect on the
catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of propane
to acrylic acid. The characterization results show no changes
in the bulk of the catalysts after the incorporation of potas-
sium, suggesting that the higher selectivity to acrylic acid
observed on K-doped catalysts could be mainly related to the
modification of both the number and the nature of acid sites
rather than changes in the oxidation state of the Sb cations
on the catalyst surface.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A MoVSb mixed metal oxide catalyst was prepared
by a hydrothermal method, using vanadyl sulfate, anti-
mony sulfate, ammonium heptamolybdate, and water with
a Mo/V/Sb atomic ratio of 1/0.18/0.15. The gel was au-
toclaved in Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave at 448 K
for 48 h. The resulting precursor was filtered, washed, dried
at 353 K for 16 h, and heat-treated at 873 K for 2 h in N2
stream. It will be called the MVS sample.
K-doped MoVSb mixed metal oxide catalysts (with
K/Mo atomic ratios from 0.002 to 0.02) have been pre-
pared by impregnation of the MVS sample with aqueous
solutions of potassium nitrate. The samples were then ro-
tavapored at 323 K and 14 kPa. The resulting powders were
dried overnight at 373 K and finally heat-treated at 773 K
for 1 h in a N2 stream. The samples will be named MVSK-n
(n = 1 to 4); their main characteristics are shown in Table 1.
For comparative purpose, a portion of the MVS precursor
was first calcined in air at 553 K (2 h) and then heat-treated
at 873 K (2 h) in N2. This sample will be referred to as MVS-
A-N.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were collected using
a Philips XPert diffractometer equipped with a graphite
monochromator, operating at 40 kV and 45 mA and employ-
ing nickel-filtered CuKα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and EDX micro-
analyses were performed on a JEOL JSM 6300 LINK ISIS
instrument. The quantitative EDX analysis was performed
using an Oxford LINK ISIS System with the SEMQUANT
program, which introduces the ZAF correction.
Infrared spectra of the samples diluted in KBr (20 mg of
the sample mixed with 100 mg of dry KBr and pressed into
a disk) were obtained with a Nicolet 710 FTIR spectrometer.
Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra (EPR) were
recorded with a Bruker ER-200D spectrometer working
in the X-band and calibrated with a DPPH standard (g =
2.0036). Quantitative analysis was carried out by double
integration of the EPR spectra and comparison with a cop-
per sulfate (CuSO4 ·5H2O) standard. Computer simulations
were employed to determine experimental parameters or to
quantify contributions of overlapping signals. Portions of
ca. 40 mg of sample were introduced inside an EPR quartz
probe cell and subjected (under conventional high vacuum
conditions) to extensive room temperature outgassing prior
to recording their spectra.
Photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a VG-
Escalab-210 Spectrometer using AlKα radiation (AlKα =
1486 eV) operated at 12 kV and 20 mA. The spectrome-
ters hemispherical analyzer was set to 50 eV constant pass
energy. The samples were previously outgassed at 373 K
for 2 h in the preparation chamber of the spectrometer and
subsequently transferred to the analysis chamber where the
pressure during spectra acquisition was 5 × 1010 Torr. The
binding energy (BE) data were referenced to C1s (BE =
284.5 eV) from surface contamination. Atomic ratios of
the elements were calculated from the relative peak areas

of the respective core-level lines using the Wagner sensi-
tivity factors [28]. The influence of the Kα3,4 satellite of
the O1s line has been taken into account for the integration
of the V2p3/2 core-level line. Thus, the satellite subtrac-
tion (intensity ratios I/I0 and energies distances E, be-
tween main line and satellite) has been adjusted by using
a reference material without vanadium in order to obtain a
smooth background baseline, as indicated in Ref. [29]. By
optimising the above mentioned parameters, the values ob-
tained for the satellite subtraction are Kα3: I/I0 = 0.06225,
E = 9.8 eV; and Kα4: I/I0 = 0.030, E = 11.8 eV.
Determination of the O1s peak area is calculated after sub-
traction of the Sb3d5/2 peak area (assuming a 3:2 peak ra-
tio of the 3d5/2:3d3/2 doublets). Data analysis procedures
involve smoothing, a Shirley background subtraction, and
curve fitting using mixed GaussianLorentzian functions by
a least-squares method.
Sb LI edge XANES spectra were acquired at room tem-
perature at the line D42, XAS 13 beamline, at the LURE
Synchrotron Radiation facility (Orsay, Paris) using a double
crystal Si (311) monochromator, detuned until 50%. Detec-
tion was made in the transmission mode by using two ion
chambers with air filled gas. Three scans were collected
for every spectra in the range 46504680 eV, with varying
energy steps in three regions: 0.5 eV/s between 4650 and
4680 eV, 0.2 eV/s in the 46804735 eV region, and 0.4 eV/s
in the range 47354780 eV. Linear background absorption
was subtracted to the entire spectra, which was then normal-
ized at approximately 50 eV above the absorption edge. The
spectrum of FeSbO4 was recorded as a reference for the po-
sition of the Sb5+ cation, with the absorption maximum at
4707.5 eV.
Infrared spectra of adsorbed ammonia were obtained in a
Bio-Rad Fis-4017 spectrophotometer.Wafers of 10 mg cm2,
mounted in a Pyrex vacuum cell fitted with KRS-5 windows,
were degassed at 473 K for 2 h and then cooled at room tem-
perature. Ammonia was first admitted at room temperature,
degassed for 1 h, and finally desorbed at 298373 K.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The catalytic experiments were carried out in a fixed-
bed quartz tubular reactor (i.d. 20 mm, length 400 mm),
working at atmospheric pressure [24]. Catalyst samples
(0.30.5 mm particle size) were introduced in the re-
actor and diluted with 24 g of silicon carbide (0.5
0.75 mm particle size) in order to keep a constant volume
in the catalyst bed. The feed consisted of a mixture of
C3H8/O2/H2O/He or C3H6/O2/H2O/He molar ratio of
4/8/30/58 or 4/9/30/57, respectively. Experiments were
carried out in the 613673 K temperature interval in order to
achieve the highest selectivity to partial oxidation products.
Reactants and reaction products were analyzed by on-line
gas chromatography [16]. Blank runs showed that the homo-
geneous reaction could be neglected under the experimental
conditions used in this work.
3. Results
3.1. Catalyst characterization
A slight decrease of the surface area is observed upon
the incorporation of potassium in the MoVSbO catalyst (Ta-
ble 1), indicating that neither the incorporation of potassium
by impregnation nor a second heat-treatment in N2 at 773 K
for 1 h have a strong influence on the specific surface area of
MoVSb-based catalysts.
The XRD pattern of the undoped MoVSbO catalyst is
shown in Fig. 1a. The appearance of peaks at 2θ = 22.3,
25.8, 28.3, 36.3, 45.0, and 50.0can be attributed to the
presence of a Sb3+-containing compound like Sb4Mo10O30

[JCPDS, 33-0104] [20,21], although the formation of (Sb2-
O)M6O19 (with M = Mo and V), a Sb5+/Sb3+-containing
crystalline phase [26] cannot be ruled out. Besides this,
peaks at 2θ = 6.6, 7.8, 8.9, 22.3, 26.3, 26.7, 27.3, and 29.3
could be related to the presence of a Sb3+-containing com-
pound like Sb2Mo10O31 [JCPDS: 33-105] [20,21], although
the formation of (SbO)2M20O56 (with M = Mo and V),
a Sb5+/Sb3+-containing phase [26], (V0.07Mo0.93)5O14
[JCPDS: 31-1437] should also be considered. No sig-
nificant differences are appreciated in the XRD patterns
when comparing undoped and K-doped MoVSbO sam-
ples (Fig. 1b), although changes in the proportion between
Sb2Mo10O31/Sb4Mo10O30 or the presence of (SbO)2M20-
O56/(Sb2O)M6O18 cannot be detected by XRD. Further-
more, additional peaks at 2θ = 12.9, 25.4, 27.2, and 38.9
which can be due to the formation, as minor phases, of un-
doped or metal-doped MoO3 [JCPDS: 5-508] are present
in both the K-free and the K-doped samples. The intensity
of these peaks is particularly high in the MVS-A-N sample
(Fig. 1c). This suggests that, in this case, a partial oxidation
of the catalyst is produced during the calcination in air at
553 K.
The morphology of the catalysts has been studied by
scanning electron microscopy with X-ray energy dispersive
analysis (EDX). The results obtained are collected in Ta-
ble 1. The SEM image of the catalysts (not reported) shows

the presence of agglomerates containing small slabs and rods
of less than 5 m in diameter. This morphology is similar to
those previously observed in Te- [23,24] or Sb-based [23]
catalysts prepared by hydrothermal synthesis. The global
chemical composition obtained by EDX analysis is in fair
agreement with those obtained by AAS (Table 1). Never-
theless, the SEM-EDX analysis evidences the presence of
local inhomogeneities in the composition of the particles,
with Sb-depleted zones, in some cases associated with lower
V concentrations (Table 1). In every case, the composition
of the crystals seems to be consistent with the crystalline
phases observed by XRD.
Fig. 2 shows the IR spectra of undoped and K-doped
catalysts. In agreement with the XRD results, the introduc-
tion of K in the MoVSb catalyst does not produce strong
changes in the bulk of the catalyst, as no significant differ-
ences are found in the positions of the bands between sam-
ples with variable K content. The modifications observed in
the overall or relative intensities of a determinate group of
bands must rather be associated with K incorporation at sur-
face positions. The bands at 868, 800, 714, and 652 cm1
can be attributed to antisymmetric vibrations of MoOMe
(Me = Mo, Sb) bridging bonds [20,24,30]. The bands at ca.
925, 600, and 454 cm1 are probably related to V=O groups
and VOMe bonds (Me = Mo, V) [20,24,29] and/or to the
presence of Sb2Mo10O31 [20]. A shoulder at 990 cm1 in-
dicates the presence of Mo=O cis-dioxo groups of MoO3
[30], which contribute to the band at 868 cm1 too.
EPR spectra recorded at 77 K consist in all cases es-
sentially in the overlapping of two signals. An example of
spectrum deconvolution is shown in Fig. 3 for the MVS
sample. All spectra basically consist in the overlapping of
a major broad symmetric signal A1 at g= 1.93 with

Hpp 1000 G and a minor axial one at g= 1.96 and
g= 1.90, signal A2, which is narrower than the former
(average width 225 G). It must be noted that signal A1
could present certain anisotropy, difficult to be resolved as
a consequence of its considerable width. Parameters of sig-
nals A1 and A2 are consistent with the presence of Mo5+
cations [16,31]; though their large linewidth does not discard
the contribution of other possible paramagnetic cations (like
V4+), which could participate into magnetically coupled
phases. This is particularly true for the major broader signal
A1, for which a higher uncertainty in its estimated parame-
ters could be inferred from computer simulations. In any
case, the significant width of both signals, with the conse-
quent absence of resolution of hyperfine features on them (it
must be considered that ca. 25% of the molybdenum95Mo
and 97Mo isotopespresents nuclear spin I = 5/2, while
99.75% of the vanadium presents I = 7/2), suggests that the
paramagnetic centers are immersed into magnetically active
environments (probably subjected to strong spinspin inter-
actions and of a considerable magnitude for centers giving
rise to signal A1). In addition, some of the samples show
a set of relatively narrow features overlapped on the spec-
trum of signals A1 + A2, which corresponds to the presence
of residual amounts of isolated V4+ species. Another signal
represented by a feature appearing at g= 3.7 is apparent
for some of the samples, particularly MVSK-2 and MVSK-
4, although it can be also present in minor amounts for the
other samples. This most likely corresponds to the forbidden
transition (ms = 2) of Mo5+ ionic pairs in an excited
triplet state [32], based on the fact that a certain intensity in-
crease is observed upon recording the spectrum at 298 K. No
systematic study of these aspects has been done since they
do not appear of relevance in the context of the present work.
Concerning the quantitative aspects, the overall amount
of paramagnetic species detected is 158.8, 167.1, and
178.1 mol g1, for MVS, MVSK-2, and MVSK-4 sam-
ples, respectively, which correspond to about 3% of the
total amount of Mo. Concerning the relative contributions
of signals A1 and A2, the A1/A2 intensity ratio displays,
according to computer simulation results, values of 4.0, 5.0,
and 5.3 for samples MVS, MVSK-2, and MVSK-4, respec-
tively.
Binding energies at peak maximum and peak half widths
(FWHM) of the V2p3/2, Mo3d5/2, Sb3d3/2, and K2p3/2
core-level lines in the XPS spectra of the MVS, MVSK-2,
and MVSK-4 samples, as well as the surface metal atomic
ratio determined from XPS data, are given in Table 2. For
comparative purposes, the XPS results of the MoVSbO sam-
ple calcined initially in air at 553 K and then in N2 at 873 K
(sample MVS-A-N) are also included. It can be noticed that
the Mo/V/Sb surface atomic ratios of the catalysts remains
almost the same after the incorporation of potassium and are
in close agreement with the bulk composition (Table 1).
The FWHM values of the Mo3d peaks are similar in all
samples and can be fitted with two components at BE =
232.7 and 231.7 eV for the Mo3d5/2 peak, which can be as-
signed to Mo6+ and Mo5+ species [24,3335]. Noteworthy,
a Mo5+/Mototal atomic ratio of about 0.35 (Mo6+/Mo5+
molar ratio close to 2) is determined for samples calcined
under N2. This contrasts with detection of exclusively Mo6+
species for MVS-A-N, suggesting that a higher overall oxi-
dation degree is achieved in this sample as a consequence of
the intermediate calcination treatment under air performed
in this sample, in agreement with XRD results.
The V2p3/2 core-level spectra of all samples can be de-
composed into two components at BE = 516.3 and 517.4 eV,
which can be assigned to V4+ and V5+, respectively [24,35].
V4+ cations seem to be the main component in undoped
and K-doped catalysts, presenting a V4+/Vtotal atomic ratio
of 0.840.87 (V4+/V5+ molar ratio around 5.5) for MVS
and MVSK-n samples (Table 3). No V3+ species have been
detected in these catalysts. However, V3+ species (BE =
515.5 eV) are observed in sample MVS-A-N, which shows
V4+/Vtotal and V3+/Vtotal atomic ratios of 0.61 and 0.29.
So, a partial reduction of V4+ to V3+ is apparently produced
for this sample.
While the addition of potassium to the MoVSb oxide does
not appear to have a strong influence on the surface composi-
tion and the nature of V2p or Mo3d XPS spectra, a different
behavior is inferred for Sb, according to the Sb3d XPS spec-
tra (Fig. 4). The peak width of the Sb3d3/2 line is sensitively
higher in the K-doped samples than in the samples without
potassium (1.95 and 1.70 eV, respectively), which could be
related to the presence of another species or to differential
charging of the samples. Since no broadening has been ob-
served in the peaks from other zones in the spectra of the
K-doped samples, contributions from differential charging
of the samples can be neglected. We must indicate that the
identification of the Sb oxidation state is complicated be-
cause the Sb3d5/2 peaks overlap with O1s peaks and the
BE separation of Sb3+ and Sb5+ is relatively small (approx-
imately 0.6 eV). The deconvolution of the Sb3d3/2 line for

the K-doped samples is shown in Fig. 4. The Sb3d3/2 peak
of the K-containing samples can be fitted with two compo-
nents at BE = 540.2 and 539.4 eV, assigned to Sb5+ and
Sb3+, respectively [26,36,37], while only one component at
BE = 539.5 eV, of Sb3+, is observed in the K-free sample.
These results suggest an oxidation of Sb3+ to Sb5+ on
the catalyst surface (with Sb5+/Sbtotal atomic ratios of 0.17
0.29) after the incorporation of potassium. However, the for-
mation of Sb5+ species is lower than that observed in the
sample MVS-A-N (Sb5+/Sbtotal atomic ratios of 0.81). Such
on-surface oxidation is not a consequence of the presence of
oxygen during the calcination of these samples, but it could
be related with the presence of nitrates (from the KNO3 used
to incorporate potassium) during the calcinations step. In
fact, when the MoVSb precursor is calcined initially with
O2 and then with N2 (sample MVS-A-N), the partial oxi-
dation of Sb3+ to Sb5+ is accompanied by partial reduction
of V5+ to V4+ and V3+, although without apparent modifi-
cation of the oxidation state of Mo (Mo6+). At this point, it
has to be said that in VSb-containing catalysts Sb5+ species
are formed from Sb3+ at the expense of the partial reduction
of V5+ to V4+ and V3+ [36,37], although, in the presence
of Mo6+, V3+ formed is rapidly oxidized to V4+ with the
formation of Mo5+.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
