This work examines the effect of Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb and Ta on the properties and catalytic behavior of
Ni-based mixed metal oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. In all mixed oxides, with
the exception of Ta, the dopants modify the NiO lattice, which contracts or expands depending on the
radius of the cation, indication for the formation of solid solutions. This systematic study of doping metals
varying from low (+1) to high valence (+5) elements clearly demonstrates the large effect of the dopants’
valence. O2-TPD experiments showed that increasing the valence of the foreign cation reduces the non-
stoichiometric oxygen due to the cation deﬁcient nature of the host oxide, in complete agreement with
the principle of controlled valence. Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements
portray furthermore that not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species reduces with
increasing dopant valence. These electrophilic oxygen species catalyze the total oxidation reactions of
ethane to COx, and thus their reduction/elimination favors the selective oxidation to ethylene. Ni–Nb–
O exhibited the best catalytic performance with a 46% ethene yield at 400 C, while Ni–Li–O demon-
strated the worst results with a respective yield of 8.42%.
Based on the results of the present work, it can be inferred that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane
ODH can be tuned with doping, based on the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts.
Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective
electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity.

1. Introduction
Ethylene is the keystone of the petrochemical industry. Global
ethylene demand growth typically averages 4–5%/year. In 2005,
global demand for ethylene increased to 107 million tons, and esti-
mates point to ethylene supplies reaching 133 million tons by 2010
[1]. Global ethylene is produced via steam cracking of naphtha
feedstocks in Europe and Asia, and ethane feedstocks in regions
with associated natural gas production, including North America
and the Middle East. High energy prices and relatively slow de-
mand growth will focus ethylene producers on energy efﬁciency
and feedstock ﬂexibility projects, targeting to reduce the extremely
high-energy demands of the endothermic steam-cracking process
[2]. Moreover, stricter air quality standards proposed in the United
States targeting at 90% reduction of NOx emissions from different
point sources, such as furnaces for ethylene production, will drive
investments to energy-balanced, environmentally friendly ethyl-
ene production processes [2].
In this context, catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane at
low temperatures is an attractive alternative route for the produc-
tion of ethylene, exhibiting particular economic, technological and
environmental interest [3–12]. Its major advantage, compared
with the conventional method, is its high-energy efﬁciency, since
the process operates at low temperatures and involves an exother-
mic reaction thus has considerably lower energy requirements. The
use of ethane as feedstock greatly reduces the cost and conforms to
the need for sustainable development, while the emission of green-
house effect gases, such as NOx and CO2, is minimal due to the low
operating temperature (<500 C). The key for a viable industrial
application of this process is the development of a highly active
and selective catalytic material, able to activate and convert the
relatively inert alkane to oleﬁn at low temperature, and at the
same time minimize the parallel and consecutive side reactions
of both the alkane and the alkene to carbon oxides.
Ethane oxidative dehydrogenation has been studied over a wide
range of catalytic materials. The most promising catalytic materials
appear to be multicomponent mixed oxides. Lopez Nieto and co-
workers have developed a catalytic formulation based on mixed
Mo–V–Te–Nb oxides, exhibiting about 75% ethylene yield at low

reaction temperature (350–400 C). The enhanced catalytic activity
of the proposed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a mul-
tifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic phase [8].
High ethylene yields have also been reported over chlorine-pro-
moted non-reducible oxides (e.g. LiCl/MgO), where however the
reaction proceeds at high temperature (>600 C) via a homoge-
neous–heterogeneous reaction scheme [9,10].
We have recently reported [13–15] the development of highly
active and selective nickel-based catalysts for the efﬁcient dehy-
drogenation of ethane to ethylene in an oxidizing environment.
Although the good performance of nickel-containing materials in
oxidative dehydrogenation was ﬁrst reported by Schuurman
et al. [16], only limited research was further conducted [17–20].
The synthesis and investigation of bulk Ni–Nb–O mixed oxides
by our group led to the development of low temperature, highly
active and selective materials for ethane ODH that exhibit one of
the best catalytic performances compared to most catalysts re-
ported in open literature [21]. The catalyst with the optimum for-
mulation, Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, exhibits an ethylene yield of 46% at
400 C, a yield which can compete with the efﬁciency of conven-
tional naphtha steam-cracking units operating at 800 C [14]. De-
tailed structural and isotopic kinetic characterization of the
materials showed that due to the favorable ionic radii, valence
and electron-donor properties of niobium, Nb cations ﬁll the cat-
ionic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice,
forming a Ni–Nb solid solution [14,15]. This substitution process
is most likely responsible for the reduction of the non-stoichiome-
try and the cationic defects and, consequently, of the unselective
oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity. Recently,
the research group of Lopez Nieto [20] investigated alumina-sup-
ported and bulk NiO and Ni–W–O mixed oxides for the ethane
ODH. Similarly to our results, the addition of tungsten was found
to strongly increase the ethylene selectivity from 20% for bulk
NiO to 60% for bulk Ni–W–O. XPS and Raman characterization
demonstrated some interaction between NiO and WO3 modifying
the nature of Ni species, however, according to the authors, a more
exhaustive study is needed to understand the possible role of tung-
sten in the catalytic behavior of these catalysts.
In this work, we investigate the effect of other than Nb non-
reducible metals on the properties and catalytic behavior of Ni–
Me–O mixed metal oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogena-
tion reaction. In an effort to yield more generalized correlations,
representative non-reducible metals from each periodic group (va-
lences ranging from +1 to +5) with similar ionic radii to Ni2+ were
selected. A series of Ni–Me–O, where Me = Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti and Ta,
mixed metal oxide catalysts were prepared and tested in the eth-
ane ODH. Special attention was given to the characterization of
the oxygen species on the materials, investigated via advanced
temperature-programmed and isotopic oxygen techniques. The ef-
fect of the doping metal on the catalytic behavior is discussed in
view of the nature of the metal and the mixed oxides’ physico-
chemical characteristics.
2. Experimental part
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A series of mixed Ni–Me–O oxides, where Me = Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti
and Ta, with a Me/Ni atomic ratio of 0.176 was prepared by the
evaporation method. In the case of Li, Mg, Al and Ga, the mixed oxi-
des were prepared by the aqueous solutions of nickel nitrate hexa-
hydrate (Merck) and the respective metal nitrates, lithium nitrate
(Alfa-Aesar), magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Baker), aluminum
nitrate nonahydrate (Baker), gallium (III) nitrate hydrate (Sigma–
Aldrich). For the preparation of the Ni–Ti–O and Ni–Ta–O samples,
nickel (II) acetate tetrahydrate (Fischer) and titanium (IV) isoprop-
oxide (Sigma–Aldrich) and tantalum (V) ethoxide (Sigma–Aldrich),
respectively, in ethanol solutions were used.
In both cases, the solution containing both metals was heated at
70 C under continuous stirring for 1 h to ensure complete dissolu-
tion and good mixing of the starting compounds. The solvent was
then removed by evaporation under reduced pressure, and the
resulting solids were dried overnight at 120 C and calcined in syn-
thetic air at 450 C for 5 h. Pure NiO, obtained from the decompo-
sition of nickel nitrate hexahydrate at 450 C for 5 h in synthetic
air, and Ni–Nb–O with an atomic Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 reported
by Heracleous and Lemonidou [14] were used as reference
materials.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Surface areas of the samples were determined by N2 adsorption
at 77 K, using the multipoint BET analysis method, with an Auto-
sorb-1 Quantachrome ﬂow apparatus. Prior to the measurements,
the samples were dehydrated in vacuum at 250 C overnight.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Siemens
D500 diffractometer, employing Cu Ka radiation. Analysis of the
XRD patterns and application of the Scherrer equation allowed
the calculation of the average particle size of the samples. The lat-
tice constant, a, of the cubic nickel oxide crystalline phase in the as
synthesized mixed oxides was also determined from the obtained
diffractograms.
UV–vis spectra were recorded in the 11,000–50,000 cm1 range
on a HITACHI U-3010 UV/vis spectrophotometer. The measure-
ments were performed in ambient atmosphere with a scanning
speed of 60 nm/min. Fused silica was used as white reference.
The reduction characteristics of the catalysts were studied by
temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments performed
in a gas ﬂow system equipped with a quadrupole mass analyzer
(Omnistar, Balzers). Typically, the catalyst sample (50 mg) was
placed in a U-shaped quartz reactor and pretreated in ﬂowing He
for 0.5 h at 450 C, followed by cooling at room temperature. The
temperature was then raised from room temperature to 800 C
with a heating rate of 10 C/min in a 5% H2/He ﬂow (50 cm3/
min). The main (m/z) fragments registered were H2 = 2, H2O = 18
and He = 4.
The oxygen desorption properties of selected catalysts were
studied by O2-TPD measurements. The catalyst sample (200 mg)
was pretreated in a ﬂow of pure oxygen at 450 C for 1 h and
cooled to room temperature under the oxygen ﬂow. The system
was subsequently ﬂushed with helium for 1 h, and the tempera-
ture was raised to 850 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min in He
(50 cm3/min). The reactor exit was monitored online by a quadru-
pole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzers), and the desorbed oxygen
was detected by following the 32 (m/z) fragment. Calibration of
the mass analyzer was performed with O2/He mixtures of known
concentration. Quantitative estimation of the amount of desorbed
oxygen was performed by integration of the corresponding oxygen
desorption rates with time.
Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange experi-
ments (TPIE) were also performed in the earlier mentioned appara-
tus. Before each experiment, the catalyst (25 mg) was pretreated in
10% 16O2/He ﬂow at 450 C for 1 h, followed by ﬂushing in He for
1 h and subsequent cooling to room temperature. The catalyst
sample (250 mg) was subjected to 2% 18O2 (Cambridge Isotope Lab-
oratories; 95% atom enrichment)/He ﬂow (40 cm3/min), and the
temperature was raised from room temperature to 650 C at a
heating rate of 15 C/min. The system was maintained isothermally
at 650 C for 30 min under the reactant mixture. The reactor exit
was connected by a heated inlet capillary system to a quadrupole
mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzer) for the online monitoring of the
68

exit gas composition. The concentration proﬁles were obtained by
registering
the
following
(m/z)
fragments:
Ye = 4,
Y2J = 18,
N2 = 28, 16O2 = 32, 16O18O = 34 and 18O2=36. Calibration of the mass
analyzer was performed with O2/He mixtures of known concentra-
tion. The total amount of exchangeable 16O species in each catalyst
was calculated from the integration of the corresponding TPIE 16O
surface formation rate, expressed as the sum of 16O in 16O18O and
16O2 surface formation rates, with time. The apparent activation
energy of the exchange reaction was calculated from Arrhenius
plots for the 18O2 surface consumption rate. The data points used
for the construction of the Arrhenius plots corresponded to 18O2
conversions lower than 10%, in order to maintain the assumption
of differential conditions in the reactor valid.
2.3. Reactivity studies
The catalytic performance of the samples was measured in a
ﬁxed-bed quartz reactor. The catalyst particles were diluted with
equal amount of quartz particles of the same size to achieve iso-
thermal operation. The temperature in the middle of the catalytic
bed was measured with a coaxial thermocouple. The samples were
activated in ﬂowing oxygen at 450 C for 30 min. The composition
of the reaction mixture used was 9.1%C2H6/9.1%O2/81.8%He.
The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane was investigated in
the temperature range from 300 C to 425 C. For the determina-
tion of the activity of the catalysts as a function of temperature,
the W/F ratio was kept constant at 0.54 g s/cm3. In order to obtain
different ethane conversion levels at constant reaction tempera-
ture (400 C), the W/F ratio was varied from 0.02 to 0.71 g s/cm3.
The reaction products were analyzed online by a Perkin–Elmer
gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector
(TCD). Two columns in a series-bypass conﬁguration were used in
the analysis: a Porapak Q and a MS 5A. The main reaction products
were C2H4, CO2 and H2O. Negligible amounts of oxygenates were
observed at the reactor exit. The ethane conversion and the selec-
tivity to the reaction products were calculated on a carbon basis.
Closure of the carbon mass-balance was better than ±1%. The con-
tribution of gas-phase initiated reactions was tested by conducting
experiments using an empty-volume reactor. The conversion of
ethane at these experiments was lower than 1%, conﬁrming that
gas-phase reactions are negligible at the experimental conditions
used for the activity tests.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The main physicochemical characteristics of the Ni–Me–O
mixed oxides are tabulated in Table 1. The surface areas of the
mixed oxides vary considerably depending on the promoting me-
tal, with relatively large surface areas recorded for Ni–Nb–O, Ni–
Al–O, Ni–Ga–O and Ni–Ta–O. The mixed oxides of Li, Mg and Ti
yielded similar surface areas as pure NiO.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the
crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts. Fig. 1 illustrates
the diffractograms obtained for all the samples plus that of NiO and
Ni–Nb–O used as reference. In most Ni–Me–O mixed oxides, XRD
analysis exhibits only diffraction lines corresponding to a crystal-
line ‘‘NiO-like” phase. In the Ni–Nb–O sample, the appearance of
an additional broad band centered at 2h 27 is apparent. This dif-
fraction has been attributed to an amorphous niobium-rich phase
[14,22]. In Ni–Ti–O, minor amounts of free TiO2 anatase are also
formed, evidenced by the diffractions at 2h 27, 48 and 54, while
for Ni–Ta–O, very poor crystallization is generally observed with
diffraction lines corresponding to NiO and NiTa2O6 at 2h 26.7,
35 and 53.
The XRD patterns were also used to estimate the average parti-
cle size of NiO in the as synthesized materials using the Scherrer
equation. The results shown in Table 1 evidence that all Ni–Me–
O mixed oxides consist of NiO crystallites in the nanorange, with
sizes ranging from 17 nm for the Ni–Nb–O catalyst to 40 nm for
the Ni–Ta–O sample.
Further analysis of the XRD patterns allowed the calculation of
the lattice parameters of the nickel oxide-like phase in the as syn-
thesized mixed oxides, presented in Table 1. The XRD analysis
shows that pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure
with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, in agreement with reported
data (JCPDS 4-835). The changes observed in the size of the NiO
unit cell in the mixed oxides indicate the incorporation of the do-
pants in the NiO structure and the formation of Ni–Me–O solid
solutions. The graphic depiction of the NiO-like phase lattice con-
stant as a function of the difference in ionic radii between Ni2+
and doping ion clearly conﬁrms the above. As seen in Fig. 2, the
NiO unit cell size expands or contracts according to the radius of
the foreign cation in comparison with that of the host (Ni2+). This
supports our previous ﬁndings on the Ni–Nb–O system [14],
according to which niobium species (Nb5+) substitute some of
the host cations (Ni2+) and/or ﬁll in cationic vacancies in the NiO
structure leading to the formation of a nickel–niobium solid solu-
tion and subsequently to a contraction of the NiO lattice, since the
radii of Nb5+ is smaller than that of Ni2+.
It can be therefore deduced that in Ni–Me–O mixed oxides, do-
pants can insert the NiO lattice relatively easy and form solid solu-
tions, independent of the valence of the foreign species which
ranged in our study from +1 to +5. What seems to be important
is the ionic radius of the dopants – the main criterion for the selec-
tion of the investigated doping elements – which has to be similar
to Ni2+.
UV–vis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordi-
nation of the nickel species in the Ni–Me–O mixed metal oxides.
The UV–vis spectra are presented in Fig. 3. It should be mentioned
that high absorbance was recorded over the whole measured
wavelength range because of the dark (gray) color of the samples,
indicating the presence of nickel in a non-stoichiometric form and
resulting in weak absorbance bands. Moreover, the Ni–Li–O sample
did not give rise to any bands due to its extremely dark color and is

therefore not included in the ﬁgure. NiO has a rock salt structure
with Ni ions in an octahedral coordination. The NiO spectrum is
dominated by absorption bands in the 16,500–11,000 cm1 range,
due to the d–d transitions of octahedral Ni(II) in the NiO lattice.
The band at 26,500 cm1 and the strong band at 14,000 cm1, as-
cribed to the 3A2g ? 3T1g(F) transition of octahedral Ni(II), are ﬁn-
gerprints for NiO [23]. The spectra acquired for the Ni–Me–O
mixed oxides closely resemble that of NiO with main bands at
14,000 and 26,500 cm1 indicating, in accordance with the XRD re-
sults, that the NiO structure is pertained in the mixed oxides with
Ni(II) in octahedral coordination. This result supports the general
notion that the dopants are incorporated in the NiO structure,
and Ni–Me–O solid solutions are formed.
Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in
order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized
nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts. The TPR proﬁles, shown in
Fig. 4, were acquired by continuously following the H2 signal with
a quadrupole mass spectrometer, while linearly increasing temper-
ature. The TPR proﬁles of the reference materials NiO and Ni–Nb–O
are also included for comparison reasons in Fig. 4. NiO exhibits a
narrow reduction peak with a maximum at 415 C, with the
amount of consumed hydrogen corresponding to total reduction
to metallic Ni. The introduction of Nb causes the appearance of a
high temperature shoulder and broadens the reduction proﬁle,
while shifting the reduction temperature of the main peak to
360 C. According to our previous results [14], the main peak is
attributed to the reduction of Ni–O–Ni bonds and the broad shoul-
der to the removal of oxygen from Ni–O–Nb bonds.
The introduction of other than Nb metals also signiﬁcantly
modiﬁes the reduction proﬁles, as shown in Fig 4. While Nb was
found to ease the reduction of Ni–O–Ni bonds, shifting the reduc-
tion temperature at lower values, all other metals seem to inhibit
the reduction process compared to pure NiO. Ni–Li–O and Ni–Al–
O exhibit similar proﬁles to NiO with one main reduction peak,
shifted to +10 C and +35 C higher temperature, respectively.
Ni–Ti–O and Ni–Ga–O on the other hand display three peaks, indi-
cating the contribution of three different distinct species in the
reduction process. In both cases, the main reduction temperature

is again shifted to higher temperatures, 470 C and 530 C for Ti
and Ga, respectively. Finally, the mixed oxide with Mg shows a
very low reducibility with a broad peak at very high temperature
>650 C. This result agrees with previous TPR-H2 studies [24,25],
which attributed the very low reducibility of Ni–Mg–O mixed
oxide to the formation of non-reducible spinel precursors in a very
early stage (not detectable by XRD).
Besides the reduction temperature, the presence of the promot-
ers also modiﬁes the consumption of hydrogen in the TPR experi-
ments. It is interesting to comment on the ratio of hydrogen
consumption versus the stoichiometrically required hydrogen to
completely reduce the nickel species present in the Ni–Me–O
mixed oxides. A ratio of 1 was calculated for the Ni–Li–O, Ni–Ti–
O, Ni–Nb–O and NiO samples, indicating that the recorded reduc-
tion curves can be attributed only to the complete reduction of
Ni2+ cations to metallic nickel. Ni–Ga–O on the other hand exhibits
a ratio higher than 1, showing that besides the full reduction of
nickel species, gallium cations also undergo a full reduction from
+3 to 0. Ni–Mg–O and Ni–Al–O are the only two materials with a
lower H2 consumption than that required for the full reduction
of the nickel species. In accordance with the above, this can be
attributed to the presence of non-reducible, spinel-like phase pre-
cursors in these two mixed oxides.
Pure NiO, calcined at low temperatures, is a well-known non-
stoichiometric oxide with cationic deﬁciency. This property ren-
ders NiO a good p-type semiconductor with its conductivity being
attributed to this cation deﬁciency [26,27]. The cationic vacancies
induce the formation of positive holes p+, the main charge carriers,
which are introduced in the form of Ni3+ or O ions to keep charge
neutrality conditions [28,29]. Our previous electrical conductivity
and O2 desorption (TPD) studies on NiO [14] validated the above,
as NiO was found to accommodate a large amount of non-stoichi-
ometric oxygen and demonstrated a large oxygen desorption peak
in the 450–850 C temperature range, in agreement with O2-TPD
measurements on NiO reported in literature [17]. Moreover, inves-
tigations on Ni–Nb–O mixed oxides [14] showed that the dissolu-
tion of a higher valence cation, such as Nb5+, in the p-type cation
deﬁcient NiO lattice reduces the positive hole p+ concentration
and, consequently, the non-stoichiometric oxygen. From the elec-
trical point of view, the dissolution of hetero-valent ions in the lat-
tice of a host oxide creates free charge carriers (electrons or holes)
in order to maintain electrical neutrality. It is therefore expected
that the dissolution of lower valence cations should have the oppo-
site effect, i.e. charge compensation should occur by additional for-
mation of O species and consequently increase in the non-
stoichiometric oxygen. To verify this hypothesis, we performed
O2-TPD measurements on the synthesized Ni–Me–O mixed oxides.
The proﬁles of oxygen desorption with increasing temperature are
compiled in Fig. 5 for all Ni–Me–O oxides, plus that of reference
NiO and Ni–Nb–O. The amount of oxygen desorbed, expressed in
mg O2 per gram of catalyst, is tabulated in Table 1. Indeed, the oxy-
gen desorption proﬁles change dramatically in the mixed oxides
compared to pure NiO. The incorporation of Li1+ in NiO results in
a second oxygen species desorbed at signiﬁcantly lower tempera-
ture (380 C compared to 700 C for pure NiO), indicating the
formation of a second very active form of oxygen. It is also impor-
tant to note that Ni–Li–O is the only material that desorbs a higher
amount of oxygen than NiO, in complete agreement with theory,
since Li is the only cation with lower valence than Ni. Our results
are in line with the work of El-shobaky and Petro [30], who studied
the effects of Li-doping on the electrical properties and surface
characteristics of NiO and found that Li-doping considerably in-
creased the non-stoichiometric oxygen of NiO (determined iodo-
metrically), as well as its electrical conductivity. In Ni–Mg–O, the
second oxygen species observed on Ni–Li–O at 380 C is reduced
to a shoulder with a broader main desorption peak located at the
same temperature as in NiO, 700 C. The amount of oxygen des-
orbed is similar to NiO, an anticipated result given the fact that
complete solid solubility exists between the two systems as both
components are cubic oxides of equal valence [31].
As the valence of the doping metals increases from +3 to +5, a
progressive reduction in the amount of desorbed oxygen is re-
corded, while a shift in the temperature of desorption is also ob-
served. For Ni–Al–O, Ni–Ga–O, Ni–Ti–O and Ni–Nb–O, only one
main desorption peak is observed with maximum desorption tem-
perature at 655 C, 635 C, 500 C and 625 C, respectively. In the
case of Ni–Ta–O, two small peaks are again detected at 530 C
and 820 C which can be possibly attributed to oxygen desorption
from the NiTa2O6 and the NiO phase, respectively. It is reminded
that Ni–Ta–O was the only mixed oxide with very poor crystalliza-
tion and not clearly identiﬁable structure.
Overall, the oxygen TPD-O2 experiments clearly support and
conﬁrm the notion that the doping metals insert the NiO lattice
and successfully form Ni–Me–O solid solutions. The quantitative
results are consistent with the principle of controlled valence
[32], since the dissolution of lower than nickel valence cations
(Li1+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the
higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron
donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and conse-
quently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor. It should
be noted that the repetition of the O2-TPD experiments without
prior O2 adsorption yielded the same desorption patterns. This
indicates that the desorbed oxygen originates from the bulk struc-
ture of the materials under study.
Finally, temperature-programmed 18O2 isotope exchange mea-
surements were conducted in order to obtain further insight on
the oxygen species and the type and density of sites available for
oxygen activation on the Ni–Me–O mixed oxides. The tempera-
ture-programmed isotope oxygen exchange proﬁles in the 30–
650 C temperature range for all Ni–Me–O oxides, plus that of ref-
erence NiO and Ni–Nb–O, are shown in Fig. 6, where the surface

consumption and formation rate of all isotopic species (18O2,
16O18O and 16O2 species) is depicted as a function of temperature.
The oxygen balance in all experiments amounted to 95±5% and
hence, the amount of oxygen consumed for any irreversible
adsorption or desorption was not signiﬁcant. A ﬁrst general obser-
vation concerning the TPIE proﬁles is that the exchange process oc-
curs on all materials via both the simple (R1 mechanism –
exchange of only one surface oxygen species) and the multiple
(R2 mechanism – simultaneous exchange of two surface oxygen
species)
heteromolecular
18O
isotope
exchange
mechanism
[33,34]. Moreover, on all materials, the exchange takes place ini-
tially via the multiple exchange mechanism, since the ﬁrst product
detected is 16O2, and then proceeds, as the surface is depleted of
16O, via the dominant simple exchange mechanism, leading to
the formation of 16O18O cross-labeled species. It can be also ob-
served that the oxygen exchange process commences at low tem-
perature on all solids, temperature range of interest for the actual
catalytic reaction. It should be commented here that the onset
temperature for the oxygen exchange is slightly higher than the
temperature where oxidative dehydrogenation occurs on the Ni–
Me–O oxides. Based on our previous experience with isotopic
experiments under oxidizing and reaction atmosphere [15], we
postulate that when the surface is partially reduced, oxygen vacan-
cies are created, and thus lattice oxygen mobility is enhanced com-
pared to exchange in the absence of the alkane, thus explaining the
observed temperature difference.
The introduction of dopants in the NiO structure modiﬁes, as in
the case of the O2-TPD experiments, both the quantity and mobility
of the exchanged oxygen species. The exchange curves of all mate-
rials demonstrate the existence of at least two types of exchange-
able oxygen species, one active in the 350–550 C temperature
range and a second one mobile at higher temperatures >550 C.
Although both species exist on all catalysts, their quantity and pro-
portion vary with the different dopants. As the valence of the dop-
ant increases, the oxygen mobile at higher temperatures seems to
reduce. The Ni–Ti–O and Ni–Ta–O catalysts constitute an exception
to the above, as the amount of high-temperature oxygen species
seems to be quite high although Ti and Ta have a valence of +4
and +5, respectively.
Quantitative results of the temperature-programmed 18O2 iso-
topic oxygen (TPIE) experiments are shown in Table 2. Indeed,
the total amount of the oxides’ exchangeable oxygen species (esti-
mated from the integration of the TPIE 16O response curves, ex-
pressed as the sum of 16O in 16O18O and 16O2) depends greatly on
the valence of the doping metal. The introduction of Li and Mg,
with valence lower and equal to that of Ni2+, greatly increases nick-
el oxide’s exchangeable oxygen, while the higher valence cations
(Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) have the opposite effect and reduce
the catalysts’ 16O species available for exchange.
As aforementioned, not only the quantity but also the lability of
the oxygen species changes in the presence of the different do-
pants. The temperature dependence of the conversion of 18O2 to
the various oxygen isotopes allowed the estimation of the apparent
activation energy of the exchange reaction for the Ni–Me–O mixed
oxides (see Table 2). The value of 114.6 kJ/mol for NiO is in good
agreement with results reported by Winter [34]. The introduction
of the dopants with valences ranging from +1 to +5 affects, in the
same pattern observed with all previous results, also the activation
energy for the exchange: Li and Mg, with valence lower and equal
to that of Ni2+, decrease the activation energy compared to NiO,
while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) have
the opposite effect and progressively increase it. Therefore, it can
be safely stated that the introduction of high valence dopants in
NiO results in fewer and more strongly bonded oxygen species
available for exchange, and consequently, for participation in the
catalyst reaction.
3.2. Catalytic performance in ethane ODH
The activity of the Ni–Me–O mixed oxide catalysts in the ethane
oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was explored under steady
state conditions between 300 and 450 C with a constant W/F
(0.54 g s/cm3) and ethane-to-oxygen (1/1) ratio. It should be noted
that in all cases, oxygen conversion did not exceed 90%. It is also
important to mention that ethylene and carbon dioxide were the
only products detected in almost all catalysts, with the exception
of Ni–Mg–O, Ni–Ga–O and Ni–Ti–O where minor amounts of CO
(maximum selectivity <4%) were also recorded. Therefore, main
reactions taking place over nickel-based catalysts are the primary
selective oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, the pri-
mary unselective total oxidation of ethane to CO2 and the second-
ary overoxidation of the produced oleﬁn to CO2. The presence of
only CO2 as by-product is a major advantage and renders these
materials very attractive from an engineering point of view since
the separation costs downstream the reactor would be greatly re-
duced in a potential industrial application of an oxidative dehydro-
genation process.

Ethane conversion is plotted as a function of temperature in
Fig. 7. Wide variations can be observed in the activity of the nick-
el-based mixed oxides based on the dopant, with ethane conver-
sion ranging from 2% for Ni–Ti–O to 66% for Ni–Nb–O at
400 C. Our previous investigations [14] on the Ni–Nb–O system
revealed that surface-exposed nickel sites constitute the active
centers for the activation of the parafﬁnic substrate. It is therefore
evident that the nature of the promoting metal drastically affects
the properties and the ability of the nickel sites to activate ethane
at low temperature. Ni–Nb–O exhibits the highest ethane conver-
sion, while the reactivity of the rest of the catalysts roughly inver-
sely follows the valence of the dopants in the following order: Ni–
Nb  Ni–Mg > Ni–Li > Ni–Ga = NiO P Ni–Al  Ni–Ti  Ni–Ta.
To account for the different surface areas of the samples, the
activity of the catalysts in terms of speciﬁc surface activity (SSAc)
– expressed as lmol C2H6 consumed/m2 s – was also considered.
Based on this deﬁnition, the reactivity of the tested catalytic mate-
rials at 350 C decreases as follows (SSAc at 350 C shown in brack-
ets):
Ni–Li
(0.139)  Ni–Mg
(0.055)  NiO
(0.049) > Ni–Nb
(0.028) > Ni–Ga (0.018) = Ni–Ti (0.017) P Ni–Al (0.011)  Ni–Ta
(0.0004). The Ni–Li–O oxide exhibits now by far the highest surface
reactivity for ethane activation, due to its very small surface area
which thus increases the surface activity. However, as will be
shown in the next paragraph, ethane activation on Ni–Li–O is
highly unselective leading to combustion and will be further com-
mented in the discussion. The reactivity order for the rest of the
Ni–Me–O oxides under study does not change dramatically when
compared on a surface activity basis.
The most important requirement for a good ODH catalyst is the
ability to effectively convert ethane to ethylene at low temperature
with a high selectivity. In order to study the selectivity of the
mixed Ni–Me–O oxides and since selectivity is generally strongly
related to conversion, we conducted a second series of experiments
at constant temperature (400 C), constant ethane/oxygen ratio (1/
1) and varying W/F from 0.02 to 0.71 g s cm3 to attain different
conversion levels. Ethylene selectivity as a function of ethane con-
version is presented in Fig. 8. The corresponding data for the NiO
and Ni–Nb–O reference materials in Fig 8, taken from [14], were
obtained at 350 C. Again, signiﬁcant differences can be observed
between the different mixed nickel oxides depending on the nature
of the promoting metal. The data clearly demonstrate that the
higher the dopant cation’s valence, the higher the initial selectivity
to the desired product, with Ni–Nb exhibiting the highest selectiv-
ity (90%) and Ni–Li the lowest (19%). Over most Ni–Me–O catalysts,
ethylene selectivity remains fairly constant with increasing ethane
conversion. The secondary overoxidation of the produced alkene,
which causes the drop of selectivity with increasing conversion,
constitutes the main problem of ODH catalysts. These materials ex-
hibit very stable ethene selectivity, indicating that they are reac-
tive toward ethane but have a very low afﬁnity to ethylene, thus
preserving the oleﬁn from further oxidation. Exceptions constitute
the Ni–Ti–O and Ni–Ta–O materials where a clear decay of the
selectivity to ethylene is observed with increasing ethane conver-
sion. It is of interest to remark that these two catalysts were the
only mixed oxides that demonstrated a similar in shape oxygen
desorption peak at 500 C. Moreover, whereas increasing dopant
valence was found to decrease the amount of oxygen species ex-
changed at high temperature in the temperature-programmed iso-
topic oxygen exchange experiments, Ni–Ti–O and Ni–Ta–O were
again the only exceptions in this trend and exhibited a relatively
large peak corresponding to these species. It could be thus inferred
that the increased afﬁnity of the Ti- and Ta-doped NiO to ethylene
could be attributed to this high-temperature oxygen species; how-
ever, further investigations are needed in order to shed light into
the nature and reactivity of the different oxygen species on the
catalysts.
Furthermore, the TPIE results showed that the dopants inﬂu-
ence not only the amount but also the mobility of the oxygen spe-
cies present in the catalytic oxides. Li and Mg, with valence lower/
equal to that of Ni2+, were found to increase the lability of the oxy-
gen species compared to pure NiO, while the presence of higher va-
lence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) resulted in more strongly
bonded oxygen groups. Our previous work on the NiO and Ni–Nb–
O system [15] revealed a correlation between the ability of the cat-
alysts to convert ethane and exchange oxygen. When the same cor-
relation was attempted with the data of the present study, using
dopants with different valences, a clear relationship between the
surface rate of 16O exchange at 450 C in the TPIE experiments
and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption at 375 C in the activity
tests was demonstrated for all catalysts, with the exception of Ni–
Ta–O (see Fig. 9). The comparison of the two rates was performed
at different temperatures, as previous isothermal isotopic oxygen
exchange experiments on NiO and Ni–Nb–O under oxidizing and
under reaction conditions [15] demonstrated clearly that in the
presence of both oxygen and ethane in the feed, oxygen mobility
is signiﬁcantly higher than under purely oxidizing conditions.
When the surface is partially reduced, due to the presence of
reductive ethane, oxygen vacancies are created, and lattice oxygen
mobility is enhanced compared to exchange in the absence of the
alkane. Therefore and in order to correctly correlate the mobility
of oxygen species truly involved in the reaction, a surface rate of
oxygen exchange at higher temperature than the surface rate of
ethane consumption in activity tests was chosen. The established

correlation between the two rates conﬁrms that the oxygen species
exchanged in the TPIE experiments do participate and play an ac-
tive role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion,
and their amount can be tuned with dopants of different nature
and valence in Me-promoted NiO catalysts.
Finally, a clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxy-
gen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively con-
vert the ethane substrate to ethylene was established. In Fig. 10,
ethylene selectivity at 10% ethane conversion and the amount of
non-stoichiometric oxygen, derived from the TPD-O2 experiments,
are plotted for each Ni–Me–O oxide as a function of the foreign cat-
ion valence. It is clearly portrayed that these two values follow an
inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, i.e. with
increasing valence, the non-stoichiometric oxygen of the oxide is
reduced and selectivity is increased. The non-stoichiometric oxy-
gen accommodated in the Ni-based catalysts has been also previ-
ously reported to inversely correlate with the selectivity to
ethylene [17,35]. Xu et al. [35] investigated the ethane ODH cata-
lytic behavior of NiO pretreated in oxygen at 500 C and 700 C
and found that the amount of non-stoichiometric oxygen can be
controlled by the pretreatment temperature. In agreement with
the present results, the authors observed that the selective activity
toward ethylene decreases with the increasing amount of non-stoi-
chiometric oxygen species in NiO. The increase in ethylene selec-
tivity with increasing dopant valence in the Ni–Me–O mixed
oxides can also be related to the less mobile oxygen species of high
valence doped NiO, which appear to be more selective and convert
ethane to ethylene.
The previous observations reinforce and generalize the conclu-
sions previously drawn on the Ni–Nb–O system. NiO is a non-stoi-
chiometric
oxide
with
cationic
vacancies
which
induce
the
formation of p+ holes, in the form of O ions, to maintain charge
neutrality conditions. These oxygen species are electrophilic in
nature and mostly responsible for the total oxidation of ethane
to CO2 on the pure NiO sample. When a foreign metal is introduced
in the NiO structure and given that the ionic radius is such that the
foreign cation can insert the oxide host lattice, a solid solution is
formed. In the case of Ni–Li–O, the dopant’s valence is lower than
Ni, and the substitution process results in an extra negative charge,
which induces the formation of O species to maintain neutrality
conditions. This is in accordance with the O2-TPD measurements
which showed an increase in the amount of desorbed oxygen,
the TPIE experiments that demonstrated the exchange of a large
amount of oxygen at low temperatures in Li/NiO and the decreased
selectivity in the ethane ODH reaction, due to the highly oxidizing
electrophilic oxygen species. In the case of doping with a higher va-
lence element, the extra positive charge induced by the substitu-
tion
process
reduces
the
surface
defects
and
consumes
or
eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species,
thus signiﬁcantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to
CO2 and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The higher
the valence of the dopant, the higher the extra positive charge in
the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and
the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by
the presented data in this work.
4. Conclusions
The present systematic study of a series of Ni-based mixed oxi-
des with doping metals varying from low (+1) to high valence (+5)
elements clearly demonstrates the large effect of the dopant in
both the physicochemical properties and the catalytic behavior of
Ni–Me–O mixed oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation
reaction. The dopants (Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb) easily insert the NiO
lattice and form solid solutions, independent of the valence of
the foreign species and given a similar ionic radius to Ni2+. This
substitution process occurring upon the introduction of the foreign
elements seems to be responsible for the increase or decrease in
nickel oxide’s non-stoichiometry. Results obtained via the temper-
ature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-pro-
grammed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the
principle of controlled valence and clearly conﬁrm that the disso-
lution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) in-
creases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher
valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors
and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently
the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor. Furthermore,
not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species
is affected by the presence of the different dopants, with high va-
lence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species.
The linear relationship established between the surface rate of
16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of
C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests conﬁrms that the mon-
itored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the
mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correla-
tion between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accom-
modate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate
to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with
increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above. The

higher the dopant cation’s valence, the higher is the initial selectiv-
ity to the desired product, with Ni–Nb exhibiting the highest selec-
tivity (90%) and Ni–Li the lowest (19%).
Therefore, an important outcome of this work is that the cata-
lytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping,
according to the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO cata-
lysts. Based on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants
can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen rad-
icals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced activity
in the selective conversion of ethane to ethylene.
