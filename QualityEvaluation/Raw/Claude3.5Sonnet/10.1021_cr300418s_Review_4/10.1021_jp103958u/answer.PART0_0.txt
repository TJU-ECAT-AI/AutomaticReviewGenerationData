[1] "Characterization of the as-prepared samples, Ce0.9Ni0.1O2y and Ce0.8Ni0.2O2y, by XRD showed a major contribution from a CeO2 fluorite-type structure"

[2] "The Ce0.9Ni0.1O2y system did not show any clear peaks that could be attributed to NiO, although the asymmetry of some ceria peaks near NiO positions can be noticed"

[3] "From the detailed characterization of the as-prepared materials, one can conclude that, in the Ce0.9Ni0.1O2y sample, the majority of the Ni is forming a solid solution with marked local structural characteristics and no segregated NiO species could be observed by any of the employed techniques."

[4] "A detailed characterization of the NiCe mixed oxides has been performed by XRD, EXAFS, DFT, and Raman studies."

[5] "EXAFS analysis shows a strongly distorted first shell for NiO contributions and NiNi correlations with a diminishing intensity as compared with bulk NiO."

[6] "Density functional studies show that a Ni substitution in the Ce lattice would lead to a significant contraction of the cell dimensions that is compensated by the expansion produced by the oxygen vacancies created in the system to maintain a charge balance."

[7] "Results of in situ TR-XRD indicate that the strong Ce  O  Ni interactions present in the mixed-metal oxide delay the reduction of the nickel cations by hydrogen up to temperatures above 400 C."

[8] "In situ characterization of the catalysts during the reaction was performed by XRD, XANES, and DRIFT."

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include:

1. X-ray Diffraction (XRD): Used to determine the crystal structure and phase composition of the doped catalysts. It can detect the presence of segregated phases and changes in lattice parameters.

2. Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS): Provides information on the local atomic environment of the dopant, including coordination numbers and bond distances. This technique is particularly useful for detecting distortions in the crystal structure caused by dopant incorporation.

3. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations: Used to predict structural changes, such as lattice contractions or expansions, resulting from dopant incorporation and vacancy formation.

4. Raman spectroscopy: Helps in identifying changes in the vibrational modes of the host lattice due to dopant incorporation and can detect the presence of secondary phases.

5. In situ Time-Resolved X-ray Diffraction (TR-XRD): Allows for real-time monitoring of structural changes during catalyst activation or reaction conditions.

6. X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES): Provides information on the oxidation state and local electronic structure of the dopant atoms.

7. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS): Used to study surface species and reaction intermediates during catalytic reactions.

These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by:

1. Confirming the incorporation of dopants into the host lattice and ruling out the formation of segregated phases.
2. Providing detailed information on local structural changes caused by dopant incorporation, such as distortions in coordination environments.
3. Allowing for in situ monitoring of structural and chemical changes during catalyst activation and reaction conditions.
4. Enabling the study of electronic properties and oxidation states of dopants, which can be correlated with catalytic activity.
5. Providing insights into reaction mechanisms and the formation of key intermediates on the catalyst surface.

By combining these techniques, researchers can build a comprehensive understanding of the doped catalyst structure, from atomic-scale interactions to bulk properties, and correlate these findings with observed catalytic performance. This multi-technique approach helps rule out alternative explanations for enhanced activity by providing a holistic view of the catalyst's structure and behavior under reaction conditions.
