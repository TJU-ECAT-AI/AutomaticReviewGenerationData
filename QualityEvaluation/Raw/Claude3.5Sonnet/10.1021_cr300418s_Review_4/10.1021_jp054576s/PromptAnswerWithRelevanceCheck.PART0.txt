The given literature does not provide information to answer this question. The text appears to be only a title and author list for a scientific article about gold/ceria-zirconia catalysts for water gas shift reactions. It does not contain any details about characterization methods, analytical approaches, or techniques for verifying dopant incorporation and distribution in metal oxide catalysts. The document also lacks information on establishing relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and catalytic performance. Without access to the full text of the article, it is not possible to address the specific questions about comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches for metal oxide catalyst dopants.

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches for verifying dopant incorporation and distribution in metal oxide catalysts. The document appears to be focused on gold/ceria-zirconia catalysts for low-temperature water gas shift reactions, but does not provide details on dopant characterization techniques or methods for establishing relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and catalytic performance. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot provide a substantive answer to the question.
