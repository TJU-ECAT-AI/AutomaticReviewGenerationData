[1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts."

[2] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordination of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides."

[3] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts."

[4] "Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the principle of controlled valence and clearly confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor."

[5] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."

Several comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying successful dopant incorporation and establishing relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and catalytic performance:

1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to investigate crystalline phases and structural changes in the doped catalysts.

2. UV-vis spectroscopy examines the coordination of nickel species in the mixed metal oxides.

3. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analyzes the reduction characteristics of the mixed oxide catalysts.

4. Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (TPD-O2) and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange (TPIE) provide insights into oxygen species and their behavior in the doped catalysts.

5. Catalytic activity tests for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) are performed to assess performance.

These techniques collectively address challenges by:

- Confirming dopant incorporation through structural analysis (XRD, UV-vis)
- Examining changes in redox properties (TPR)
- Analyzing oxygen species and their mobility (TPD-O2, TPIE)
- Correlating oxygen exchange rates with catalytic activity to establish structure-function relationships
- Ruling out alternative explanations by providing multiple, complementary lines of evidence for dopant effects on catalyst structure and performance
