[1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts."

[2] "The changes observed in the size of the NiO unit cell in the mixed oxides indicate the incorporation of the dopants in the NiO structure and the formation of NiMeO solid solutions."

[3] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordination of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides."

[4] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts."

[5] "Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the principle of controlled valence and clearly confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor."

Several complementary characterization methods are crucial for verifying dopant incorporation and distribution in metal oxide catalysts:

1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) to analyze crystalline phases and changes in unit cell parameters.

2. UV-vis spectroscopy to study the coordination environment of metal species.

3. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) to examine reduction characteristics.

4. Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) to quantify non-stoichiometric oxygen.

5. Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange (TPIE) to assess oxygen mobility and reactivity.

These techniques collectively provide evidence of dopant incorporation by revealing structural changes, alterations in oxidation states, and modifications to oxygen species. The combination of bulk and surface-sensitive methods helps establish clear relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and catalytic performance. By correlating results from multiple techniques, alternative explanations can be ruled out and a comprehensive understanding of the doped catalyst system can be developed.

几种互补的表征方法对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的掺入和分布至关重要：

1. X射线衍射(XRD)分析晶相和晶胞参数的变化。

2. 紫外-可见光谱分析金属物种的配位环境。

3. 程序升温还原(TPR)检查还原特性。

4. 程序升温氧脱附(O2-TPD)定量非化学计量氧。

5. 程序升温同位素氧交换(TPIE)评估氧的移动性和反应性。

这些技术通过揭示结构变化、氧化态改变和氧物种修饰，共同为掺杂剂的掺入提供证据。体相和表面敏感方法的结合有助于建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能之间的清晰关系。通过关联多种技术的结果，可以排除其他解释，并对掺杂催化剂体系形成全面的理解。
