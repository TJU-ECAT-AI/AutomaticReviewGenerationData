[1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts."

[2] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordination of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides."

[3] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts."

[4] "Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the principle of controlled valence and clearly confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor."

[5] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."

The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying successful dopant incorporation and establishing structure-performance relationships include:

1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) to investigate crystalline phases and structural changes
2. UV-vis spectroscopy to study coordination of metal species
3. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) to analyze reduction characteristics
4. Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (TPD-O2) to examine oxygen species
5. Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange (TPIE) to probe oxygen mobility and reactivity

These techniques address challenges by:

1. Providing complementary structural and chemical information at different scales
2. Allowing direct observation of dopant effects on host lattice and oxygen species
3. Enabling correlation between oxygen properties and catalytic performance
4. Ruling out alternative explanations through multiple consistent characterization results

The combination of bulk and surface-sensitive techniques, along with isotopic labeling studies, provides strong evidence for dopant incorporation and its impact on catalyst properties and performance. The established relationships between dopant valence, oxygen species, and catalytic behavior further support the proposed structure-function correlations.
