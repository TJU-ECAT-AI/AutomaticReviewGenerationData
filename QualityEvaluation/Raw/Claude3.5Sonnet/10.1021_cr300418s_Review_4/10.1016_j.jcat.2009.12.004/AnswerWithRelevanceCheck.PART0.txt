          [1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts."

[2] "The changes observed in the size of the NiO unit cell in the mixed oxides indicate the incorporation of the dopants in the NiO structure and the formation of NiMeO solid solutions."

[3] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordination of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides."

[4] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts."

[5] "Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the principle of controlled valence and clearly confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor."

[6] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."

          Several complementary characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying successful dopant incorporation and establishing relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and catalytic performance:

1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) to investigate crystalline phases and structural changes in the doped catalysts. Changes in unit cell parameters provide evidence of dopant incorporation.

2. UV-vis spectroscopy to examine the coordination environment of metal species in the mixed metal oxides, providing further evidence of dopant integration.

3. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) to analyze the reduction characteristics of the mixed oxide catalysts and how they are modified by dopant incorporation.

4. Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (TPD-O2) to quantify changes in oxygen species due to dopant incorporation.

5. Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange (TPIE) to assess oxygen mobility and reactivity in the doped catalysts.

6. Catalytic activity tests (e.g., for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation) to correlate structural changes with performance.

These techniques collectively address challenges in establishing structure-property relationships by:

- Providing direct evidence of dopant incorporation through structural changes (XRD, UV-vis)
- Quantifying modifications to oxygen species and their reactivity (O2-TPD, TPIE)
- Demonstrating changes in redox properties (TPR)
- Correlating oxygen exchange rates with catalytic activity to establish structure-function relationships
- Offering insights into the nature and distribution of active sites

By combining these methods, researchers can establish clear links between dopant presence, structural modifications, and catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations for observed changes in activity or selectivity. The use of multiple complementary techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of the doped catalyst system, allowing for more robust conclusions about the role of dopants in enhancing catalytic performance.

          几种互补的表征方法和分析方法对于验证掺杂剂的成功引入以及建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间的关系至关重要：

1. X射线衍射(XRD)用于研究掺杂催化剂中的晶相和结构变化。晶胞参数的变化提供了掺杂剂掺入的证据。

2. UV-vis光谱用于检查混合金属氧化物中金属物种的配位环境，为掺杂剂整合提供进一步的证据。

3. 程序升温还原(TPR)用于分析混合氧化物催化剂的还原特性，以及它们如何被掺杂剂的引入所改变。

4. 程序升温氧脱附(TPD-O2)用于量化由于掺杂剂掺入而导致的氧物种变化。

5. 程序升温同位素氧交换(TPIE)用于评估掺杂催化剂中氧的移动性和反应性。

6. 催化活性测试（如乙烷氧化脱氢）用于将结构变化与性能相关联。

这些技术共同解决了建立结构-性能关系的挑战，通过：

- 通过结构变化提供掺杂剂掺入的直接证据(XRD, UV-vis)
- 量化氧物种及其反应性的修饰(O2-TPD, TPIE)
- 展示氧化还原性质的变化(TPR)
- 将氧交换速率与催化活性相关联，建立结构-功能关系
- 提供关于活性位点的性质和分布的见解

通过结合这些方法，研究人员可以建立掺杂剂存在、结构修饰和催化性能之间的明确联系，同时排除对观察到的活性或选择性变化的其他解释。使用多种互补技术提供了对掺杂催化剂系统的全面理解，从而能够对掺杂剂在增强催化性能中的作用得出更加可靠的结论。
