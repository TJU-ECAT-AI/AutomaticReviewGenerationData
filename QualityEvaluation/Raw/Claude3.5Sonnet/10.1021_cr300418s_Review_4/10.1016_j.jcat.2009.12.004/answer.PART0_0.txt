[1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts."

[2] "The changes observed in the size of the NiO unit cell in the mixed oxides indicate the incorporation of the dopants in the NiO structure and the formation of NiMeO solid solutions."

[3] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordination of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides."

[4] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts."

[5] "Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the principle of controlled valence and clearly confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor."

Several complementary characterization methods are crucial for verifying dopant incorporation and distribution in metal oxide catalysts:

1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) to investigate crystalline phases and changes in unit cell parameters, indicating dopant incorporation into the host structure.

2. UV-vis spectroscopy to study the coordination environment of metal species in the mixed oxides.

3. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) to examine the reduction characteristics of the doped catalysts.

4. Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange (TPIE) to analyze oxygen species and their mobility.

These techniques help establish relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and catalytic performance by:

- Confirming formation of solid solutions and dopant incorporation
- Examining changes in metal coordination and oxidation states
- Analyzing oxygen species and their reactivity
- Correlating oxygen mobility with catalytic activity

Using multiple complementary techniques allows researchers to build a comprehensive understanding of the doped catalyst structure and properties, ruling out alternative explanations by providing consistent evidence across different analytical methods.
