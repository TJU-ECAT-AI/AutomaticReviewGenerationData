[1] "In situ-EPR, in situ-UVVIS spectroscopy and on line-GC have been for the first time simultaneously combined to follow the behaviour of lanthanum-doped CrOx/ZrO2 and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."

[2] "These techniques provide complementary information on the structure and valence state of transition metal ions (TMI) during reaction."

[3] "For example, Cr6+ species are not visible by EPR but do give rise to intense charge-transfer (CT) transitions in the UVVIS spectrum while EPR is able to distinguish between Cr5+ and Cr3+ sites of different structure."

[4] "XPS measurements that reveal a markedly lower Cr concentration on the surface than in the bulk already for the as-synthesized catalyst which is expected to decrease even more upon reduction during time on stream."

The literature describes several crucial characterization methods and analytical approaches for verifying dopant incorporation and distribution in metal oxide catalysts:

1. In situ-EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance): This technique can distinguish between different oxidation states and structural environments of paramagnetic species like Cr5+ and Cr3+.

2. In situ-UVVIS spectroscopy: This method can detect species not visible by EPR, such as Cr6+, through charge-transfer transitions. It can also provide information on the formation of carbon deposits during catalyst deactivation.

3. On-line GC (Gas Chromatography): This allows for real-time monitoring of catalytic performance by analyzing reaction products.

4. XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy): This surface-sensitive technique can reveal the concentration of dopants on the catalyst surface compared to the bulk.

The simultaneous combination of these techniques addresses several challenges in establishing relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and catalytic performance:

1. It allows for the observation of catalyst behavior under real working conditions, rather than relying on ex-situ measurements.

2. It provides complementary information on different oxidation states and structural environments of the active species.

3. It enables the correlation of spectroscopic data with catalytic performance in real-time.

4. It helps rule out alternative explanations by providing a comprehensive view of the catalyst's state during reaction.

However, the literature does not explicitly discuss methods for verifying homogeneous distribution of dopants. Additional techniques like elemental mapping or high-resolution microscopy might be necessary to address this aspect fully.

文献描述了几种关键的表征方法和分析方法，用于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的掺入和分布：

1. 原位EPR（电子顺磁共振）：这种技术可以区分顺磁物种（如Cr5+和Cr3+）的不同氧化态和结构环境。

2. 原位UVVIS光谱：这种方法可以通过电荷转移跃迁检测EPR不可见的物种，如Cr6+。它还可以提供催化剂失活过程中碳沉积形成的信息。

3. 在线GC（气相色谱）：这允许通过分析反应产物来实时监测催化性能。

4. XPS（X射线光电子能谱）：这种表面敏感技术可以揭示催化剂表面与体相相比的掺杂剂浓度。

这些技术的同时组合解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能之间关系的几个挑战：

1. 它允许在实际工作条件下观察催化剂行为，而不是依赖于非原位测量。

2. 它提供了活性物种不同氧化态和结构环境的互补信息。

3. 它能够实时关联光谱数据与催化性能。

4. 它通过提供催化剂在反应过程中状态的全面视图，有助于排除替代解释。

然而，文献并未明确讨论验证掺杂剂均匀分布的方法。可能需要额外的技术，如元素映射或高分辨率显微镜，来充分解决这一方面。
