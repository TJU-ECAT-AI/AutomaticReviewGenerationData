[1] "In situ-EPR, in situ-UVVIS spectroscopy and on line-GC have been for the first time simultaneously combined to follow the behaviour of lanthanum-doped CrOx/ZrO2 and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."

[2] "These techniques provide complementary information on the structure and valence state of transition metal ions (TMI) during reaction."

[3] "For example, Cr6+ species are not visible by EPR but do give rise to intense charge-transfer (CT) transitions in the UVVIS spectrum while EPR is able to distinguish between Cr5+ and Cr3+ sites of different structure."

[4] "XPS measurements that reveal a markedly lower Cr concentration on the surface than in the bulk already for the as-synthesized catalyst which is expected to decrease even more upon reduction during time on stream."

The study demonstrates that a comprehensive approach combining multiple in-situ characterization techniques is crucial for verifying dopant incorporation and distribution in metal oxide catalysts. The key methods used are:

1. In-situ EPR spectroscopy: This technique can distinguish between different oxidation states and structures of certain metal ions, such as Cr5+ and Cr3+.

2. In-situ UVVIS spectroscopy: This method can detect species not visible by EPR, such as Cr6+, through charge-transfer transitions.

3. On-line GC: This allows for real-time monitoring of catalytic performance.

4. XPS: This technique provides information on surface composition and oxidation states.

The combination of these techniques addresses challenges in establishing relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and catalytic performance by:

1. Providing complementary information on the structure and valence state of transition metal ions during the reaction.

2. Allowing simultaneous monitoring of catalyst structure and performance under identical reaction conditions.

3. Enabling the observation of changes in metal oxidation states and the formation of carbonaceous deposits during the reaction, which cannot be obtained from ex-situ measurements.

4. Revealing the distribution of dopants between surface and bulk, which is crucial for understanding their role in catalysis.

This comprehensive approach helps rule out alternative explanations by providing a more complete picture of the catalyst's behavior under reaction conditions, rather than relying on a single characterization method or ex-situ measurements.

研究表明，结合多种原位表征技术的综合方法对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的掺入和分布至关重要。使用的关键方法包括：

1. 原位EPR光谱：该技术可以区分某些金属离子的不同氧化态和结构，如Cr5+和Cr3+。

2. 原位UVVIS光谱：该方法可以通过电荷转移跃迁检测EPR不可见的物种，如Cr6+。

3. 在线GC：这允许实时监测催化性能。

4. XPS：该技术提供表面组成和氧化态的信息。

这些技术的组合通过以下方式解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能之间关系的挑战：

1. 提供反应过程中过渡金属离子结构和价态的互补信息。

2. 允许在相同反应条件下同时监测催化剂结构和性能。

3. 能够观察到反应过程中金属氧化态的变化和碳质沉积物的形成，这些信息无法从非原位测量中获得。

4. 揭示掺杂剂在表面和体相之间的分布，这对理解它们在催化中的作用至关重要。

这种综合方法通过提供催化剂在反应条件下行为的更完整图像，而不是依赖单一表征方法或非原位测量，有助于排除替代解释。
