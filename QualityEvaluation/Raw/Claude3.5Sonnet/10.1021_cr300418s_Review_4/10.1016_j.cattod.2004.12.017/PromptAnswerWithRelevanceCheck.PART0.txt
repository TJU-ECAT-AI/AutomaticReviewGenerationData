The given literature does not specifically address comprehensive characterization methods for verifying dopant incorporation and distribution in metal oxide catalysts. The text focuses on operando spectroscopy methodology for studying catalysts under reaction conditions, but does not discuss techniques for analyzing dopants or establishing structure-activity relationships for doped catalysts. To properly answer this question would require information from other sources about characterization methods like XRD, XPS, EXAFS, and electron microscopy that can probe dopant incorporation and distribution. The literature provided does not contain the necessary information to address the specific challenges outlined in the question regarding dopants in metal oxide catalysts.
