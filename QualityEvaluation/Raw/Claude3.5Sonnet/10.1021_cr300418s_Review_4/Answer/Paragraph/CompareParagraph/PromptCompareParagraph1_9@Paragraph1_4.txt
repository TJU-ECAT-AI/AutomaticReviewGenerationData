4 Characterization Methods for Doped Oxides
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
4.1 Introduction
The substitution of a dopant atom in a metal oxide host, even at very small concentrations, can have profound effects on the properties of the host, including alterations in electronic and transport properties, morphology changes, and lower phase transition temperature. Ultimately, when making doped-oxide catalysts, we hope to improve their functional performance. If the performance is improved, we would like to show that the improvement is due to dopant substitution so that we might develop a more general understanding of the connection between dopant&ndash;oxide pairing and catalytic activity. The methods of characterization need to answer the following questions. Is the active catalyst a homogeneously doped oxide with some dopant in the surface layer? Are we sure that the dopant did not make very small oxide clusters on the surface? Can we rule out the presence of two phases? Are we sure that catalytic activity is not due to impurities in the precursors? What differences in activity are caused by different methods of preparation of doped oxides with the same nominal composition?
It is difficult to establish beyond doubt that (1) a true homogeneously “doped” oxide has been synthesized, and (2) it is the homogeneously doped phase that is responsible for the observed catalytic activity.
Below we discuss methods that have been frequently used in research on catalysis by doped oxides to help answer the questions posed above. Because we are interested in catalysis, our primary interest is in the properties of the surface. Nevertheless, it is helpful to show (i) that a material that is homogenously doped in the bulk has been synthesized (e.g., by XRD), and (ii) that the surface composition is the same or different from that of the bulk (e.g., by XPS). We will mention only characterization methods that use photons, electrons, or chemical behavior (Table 1).

4.2 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
It is generally accepted that a doped oxide should have the structure of the host oxide (e.g., Ti-doped ceria should have the fluoride structure of the undoped ceria). Rietveld analysis is used to determine whether doping caused a small shift in the lattice parameter. These are necessary conditions for “proving” that a doped oxide has been prepared. XRD can identify whether or not a single crystalline phase is present to within the resolution of the instruments (typically >1%). Peak widths are fit to the Debye&ndash;Scherrer equation to determine crystallite size. Shifts due to substitutional doping are often interpreted using Vegard’s rule, which states that there is a linear relationship between the concentration of a substitutional dopant and the change in the lattice parameter. There is no theoretical basis for Vegard’s rule, and many violations have been documented. As an added complication, the lattice parameters of small nanocrystals depend on crystallite size, and one is not sure whether the observed lattice parameters shift is due to doping or to the small size of the crystallites.
4.3 Synchrotron Radiation
The synchrotron provides tunable X-ray radiation having 6 orders of magnitude greater intensity than laboratory sources. The frequency is tunable, and ultrafast time-resolved pulses of X-ray beams with small angular divergence are available. The beamline spectrometers are routinely capable of resolution below 0.1 eV and below 1 meV in certain cases.
High intensity allows the performance of X-ray diffraction in situ, on a time scale comparable to that on which structural changes occur in a catalyst. For example, Rodriguez’s group (128) has used this technique to show that metallic Ni clusters are formed from NixCe1&ndash;xO2, under reaction conditions.
The monochromatic, high-intensity, coherent X-ray beams allow the investigation of solid-state catalysts both ex situ and in situ by examining the various aspects of energy dependent X-ray absorption. Different techniques explore different energy regimes. XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy) and NEXAFS (near edge X-ray adsorption fine structure) refer to the same measurements but different energy ranges. (129, 130) An X-ray photon is adsorbed to make a core hole, and as a result the sample emits photons and Auger electrons, whose energy and intensity are measured. The technique provides information about the empty states of the system, the oxidation state of the atom, and its coordination.
EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) is used to determine the geometry and the chemical composition of the atoms surrounding the atom that emitted the photoelectron. (129, 130)
In studies of ceria doped with Ba, La, Y, Hf, or Zn, used as a catalyst for the water&ndash;gas shift reaction, Linganiso and co-workers used XANES under TPR reaction conditions to show that the dopants increased the reducibility of ceria with hydrogen. (112) In work with K-doped MoVSbO, for selective oxidation of propane and propylene, Balsko et al. (113) were able to demonstrate with XANES that the presence of the potassium on the surface resulted in partial oxidation of surface Sb3+ to Sb5+; however, despite the use of FTIR, XRD, XPS, and EPR, in addition to XANES, there was no unequivocal evidence presented that the catalyst was atomically doped with K rather than intermixed with potassium oxides present on the surface.
EXAFS has been used to study the bulk properties of doped oxides, and it is capable of providing the location of the dopant in the solid (e.g., substitutional or interstitial) and the positions of its neighbors. (102, 104, 131-134)
4.4 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
This technique does not require synchrotron radiation and is widely used for the characterization of doped oxide catalysts. It provides information on atoms located within 2&ndash;4 times the electron inelastic mean free path (∼1&ndash;10 nm). (114) The surface composition and oxidation state may be determined if the species of interest are present at the surface in concentration greater than approximately 1 at. %. XPS is generally performed in vacuum and is typically ex situ; thus the oxidation states measured may not reflect the electronic environment under reaction conditions. When used in conjunction with XRD and other means of determining bulk ratios of host:dopant atoms, XPS data can (i) determine the surface concentration of the dopant, and (ii) provide the oxidation states of the atoms located on the surface or in several layers near the surface. In an investigation of Pt-doped Fe2O3, Hu et al. synthesized doped polycrystalline films by electrochemical codeposition, and then confirmed that homogeneous solid solution was obtained by both XRD and by performing XPS as a function of time while etching the material with an ion beam. (111) Recent work by Rajesh et al. demonstrated that ionic Pt was substituted on Ce sites of a doped BaCeO3 perovskite prepared by coprecipitation for the water&ndash;gas shift reaction. (135) High-resolution electron microscopy along with XRD with Rietveld refinement and neutron diffraction were used to confirm the structure. The XPS data supported the presence of Pt2+ substituting Ce4+ sites, which was consistent with the observed linear decrease in cell volume and increase in oxygen vacancies with increase in Pt concentration. No metallic Pt was observed either pre- or postreaction, but an increase in the surface concentration of Pt4+ after the reaction was noted.
4.5 X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (XRF)
In XRF, an X-ray beam is used to excite core electrons of the atomic constituents in the sample, which decay through the emission of X-rays with energies characteristic of the element. Use of energy dispersive spectrometers (EDX, EDS) or wavelength dispersive spectrometers (WDX, WDS) allows energy resolution sufficient for quantitative elemental characterization, provided sufficient source intensity is available. XRF is used for establishing the concentration of dopants in the bulk of the catalyst. The technique can detect strongly absorbing atomic species at low (ppm) concentrations within metal oxides. In their investigation of methane partial oxidation on yttrium-stabilized zirconia, Zhu et al. found by XRF that all of their metal oxide catalysts had 0.005&ndash;1.17 mol % titania and hafnium oxide contamination. (115) Surface analysis using LEIS did not have sufficient sensitivity to detect whether or not the Ti or Hf species were present on the surface.
4.6 Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)
In this technique, light absorption is used to identify the atoms produced by the atomization (e.g., by using a flame) of the doped oxide. In their investigations of doped rare earth oxides, Korf and colleagues used AAS to identify alkali promoters added by wet impregnation of Sm2O3, CaO, or MgO used for the oxidative coupling of methane. (65, 116) In both studies, the volatility and migration of monovalent Na and Li species downstream in the reactors and the stability of the divalent Ca promoters were established by AAS of the catalysts before and after reaction.
4.7 Ultraviolet Optical Spectroscopy (UV&ndash;Vis)
UV&ndash;vis can be used to establish the presence of isolated dopant cations within a metal oxide. The spectra of the metal ions are interpreted by ligand field theory: ions with tetrahedral coordination are readily differentiated from octahedrally coordinated ones. Brückner used in situ UV&ndash;vis and EPR to characterize lanthanum- and chromium-doped alumina and zirconia, which catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. (117) The UV&ndash;vis data showed that the as-synthesized catalyst exhibited Cr3+ d&ndash;d UV&ndash;vis absorbance at 630 nm in addition to a charge transfer bands from Cr6+ at 370 nm. Furthermore, EPR indicated the presence of Cr5+. Under the reducing environment of the propane dehydrogenation, even below reaction temperatures, the in situ characterization showed that both the Cr5+ and the Cr6+ were reduced to Cr3+. Zirconia stabilization in the cubic and tetragonal phases rather than monoclinic is of importance in maintaining an activated catalyst. Lopez et al. used UV&ndash;vis characterization of Mn-doped zirconia catalysts, prepared by coprecipitation, for the oxidation of phenanthrene and isopropanol. (118) At 10% doping, XRD confirmed that the Mn4+ substitutes for the Zr4+ and stabilized the catalyst against the monoclinic phase transition. The UV&ndash;vis data support the presence of a solid solution of Mn in ZrO2 at 10% substitution and show the presence on Mn2O3 at loadings greater than 10%.

Comprehensive characterization methods for verifying dopant incorporation, distribution, and effects on the structure and catalytic performance of doped metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation include:

1. X-ray Diffraction (XRD): This technique is crucial for determining crystal structure, phase composition, and lattice parameter changes due to dopant incorporation. High-resolution XRD can detect the formation of solid solutions and absence of separate dopant phases [10.1021/cm0103895]. Rietveld refinement of XRD data can confirm structural changes like oxide ion vacancies resulting from dopant incorporation [10.1021/cm0103895].

2. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): XPS provides information on surface composition, oxidation states, and chemical environment of dopants. It can reveal surface enrichment of dopants and changes in electronic structure [10.1021/cm040126l].

3. Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES): These synchrotron-based techniques offer detailed information on local atomic structure, coordination numbers, and bond distances around dopant atoms. They can confirm dopant incorporation into the host lattice and reveal structural changes [10.1021/cm0201706].

4. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX): TEM provides visual evidence of dopant distribution and absence of segregated phases, while EDX allows for elemental mapping [10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.01.120].

5. Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR): TPR examines changes in reducibility of the catalyst due to dopant incorporation, revealing alterations in metal-support interactions [10.1016/j.apcata.2006.01.025].

6. In-situ spectroscopic techniques: Combining in-situ EPR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and online GC allows for simultaneous monitoring of catalyst structure, oxidation states, and catalytic performance under reaction conditions [10.1039/b107005c].

7. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS): This technique analyzes surface species formation, reactivity, and decomposition kinetics, providing insights into how dopants affect reaction mechanisms [10.1016/j.apcata.2006.01.025].

8. High Sensitivity-Low Energy Ion Scattering (HS-LEIS): This surface-sensitive technique provides quantitative compositional information about the outermost atomic layer, crucial for understanding surface segregation effects [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.10.012].

These techniques collectively address the challenges in establishing clear relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by:

1. Providing complementary information at different scales (bulk vs. surface vs. local structure).
2. Allowing for the detection of subtle changes in the host lattice that may not be apparent from a single technique.
3. Enabling researchers to rule out alternative explanations by providing a comprehensive view of the material's structure and composition.
4. Offering insights into the electronic structure and chemical environment of the dopants, which can be directly related to catalytic performance.
5. Allowing for in-situ monitoring of structural and chemical changes during catalyst activation and reaction conditions.

By combining these techniques, researchers can build a strong case for the successful incorporation of dopants and their effects on the host material's properties, while ruling out alternative explanations such as phase segregation or surface deposition of dopants.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive characterization of doped metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation requires a multi-technique approach that spans various length scales and probes different aspects of the material. Future research directions may focus on:

1. Developing advanced in-situ and operando characterization techniques that can provide real-time, spatially-resolved information on catalyst structure and performance under realistic reaction conditions.

2. Integrating machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches to analyze and correlate the large datasets generated by multiple characterization techniques, potentially uncovering hidden structure-property relationships.

3. Exploring novel synchrotron-based techniques that offer higher spatial and temporal resolution, allowing for the detection of transient species and local structural changes during catalysis.

4. Advancing the development of environmental TEM techniques to observe dopant behavior and catalyst structural changes under reaction conditions at atomic resolution.

5. Investigating the use of isotope labeling combined with advanced spectroscopic techniques to elucidate reaction mechanisms and the role of dopants in catalytic cycles.

6. Developing standardized protocols for multi-technique characterization to ensure reproducibility and comparability of results across different research groups.

By pursuing these directions, researchers can gain deeper insights into the complex relationships between dopant incorporation, structural modifications, and catalytic performance in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, potentially leading to the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for this important industrial process.
