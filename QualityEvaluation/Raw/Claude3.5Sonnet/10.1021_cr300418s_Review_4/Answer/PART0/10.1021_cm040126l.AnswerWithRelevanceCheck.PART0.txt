          [1] "XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."

[2] "TEM images show only CeO2 crystallites of about 50 nm and no evidence of any metal particles up to 1 atom % Rh."

[3] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies demonstrate that Rh is dispersed in the +3 oxidation state on CeO2 with enhanced Rh ion concentration in the surface layers."

[4] "An average coordination number of 2.5 at a distance of 2.05 Å in the first shell is obtained around Rh ions from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, indicating an oxide ion vacancy around the Rh ion."

[5] "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern could be refined to the fluorite structure with Rh substituting in the Ce site."

[6] "Rietveld refinement confirms the absence of rhodium metal or rhodium oxide phases."

[7] "EXAFS analysis shows that Rh ion is substituted for Ce4+ ion in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites with oxide ion vacancies around it."

[8] "The H2/Rh ratio obtained from hydrogen uptake measurement was 5.4, 2.4, and 2.1, respectively in 0.5, 1, and 2% Rh/CeO2, indicating a significant contribution from the reduction of CeO2 in the presence of Rh."

[9] "The enhanced catalytic activity of Rh/CeO2 is shown to be due to the formation of a Ce1-xRhxO2-δ type of solid solution with Rh3+OCe4+ kind of linkages on the surface."

          The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include:

1. X-ray Diffraction (XRD): Used to confirm the absence of separate rhodium metal or oxide phases, verify the CeO2 structure, and refine the structure showing Rh substitution in Ce sites.

2. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): Provides visual evidence of the absence of metal particles and shows the size of CeO2 crystallites.

3. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): Demonstrates the oxidation state of Rh and its enhanced concentration in surface layers.

4. Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy: Provides detailed information about the local structure around Rh ions, including coordination numbers and bond distances, and indicates the presence of oxide ion vacancies.

5. Rietveld refinement: Confirms the absence of separate rhodium phases and helps in structural analysis.

6. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) with hydrogen uptake measurements: Assesses changes in redox properties and interactions between the dopant and host.

These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by:

1. Ruling out the presence of separate Rh phases or particles, confirming its incorporation into the CeO2 structure.
2. Providing evidence of Rh substitution in Ce sites and its oxidation state.
3. Showing the local environment around Rh ions, including oxide vacancies.
4. Demonstrating the enhanced concentration of Rh in surface layers, which is crucial for catalytic activity.
5. Revealing redox properties that are important for catalytic performance.
6. Quantifying surface enrichment of the dopant and altered reduction behavior indicative of strong dopant-host interactions.

By combining these complementary techniques, researchers can build a comprehensive picture of the catalyst structure and composition, ruling out alternative explanations for enhanced catalytic performance such as the presence of separate Rh phases or surface-deposited Rh particles. This approach provides strong evidence for dopant incorporation and its effects on catalyst structure, allowing researchers to establish clear relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced activity while systematically ruling out alternative explanations.

          验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂成功掺入和均匀分布的关键综合表征方法和分析方法包括：

1. X射线衍射（XRD）：用于确认不存在单独的铑金属或氧化物相，验证CeO2结构，并细化结构，显示铑在铈位置的替代。

2. 透射电子显微镜（TEM）：提供金属颗粒不存在的视觉证据，并显示二氧化铈晶体的大小。

3. X射线光电子能谱（XPS）：显示铑的氧化态及其在表面层的浓度增加。

4. 扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）光谱：提供关于铑离子周围局部结构的详细信息，包括配位数和键长，并指示氧离子空位的存在。

5. Rietveld精修：确认不存在单独的铑相，并有助于结构分析。

6. 氢气吸收测量的程序升温还原（TPR）：评估氧化还原性质的变化以及掺杂剂与主体之间的相互作用。

这些技术通过以下方式解决了在建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强的催化性能之间明确关系的挑战：

1. 排除单独铑相或颗粒的存在，确认其掺入二氧化铈结构中。
2. 提供铑替代铈位置及其氧化态的证据。
3. 显示铑离子周围的局部环境，包括氧空位。
4. 证明表面层中铑浓度的增加，这对催化活性至关重要。
5. 揭示对催化性能重要的氧化还原性质。
6. 量化掺杂剂的表面富集程度和表明掺杂剂-主体强相互作用的改变的还原行为。

通过结合这些互补技术，研究人员可以构建催化剂结构和组成的全面图像，排除增强催化性能的其他解释，如单独铑相的存在或表面沉积的铑颗粒。这种方法为掺杂剂的掺入及其对催化剂结构的影响提供了强有力的证据，使研究人员能够建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强活性之间的明确关系，同时系统地排除其他解释。
