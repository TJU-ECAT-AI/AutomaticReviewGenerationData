          [1] "NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents were prepared by a modified sol–gel method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning/high-resolution transmission electron microscope (SEM/HRTEM), BET surface area analysis, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and O2 temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD)."

[2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and the chemical environment of the catalysts, indicating the existence of strong interaction between Ni and Zr."

[3] "The cell parameters variation was calculated by the peak positions of NiO-like phase by Debye–Scherrer method. The results, listed in Table 1, show that the cell parameter of the catalysts increased with the increasing Zr content up to 10%. Such increase indicates that larger Zr4+ ions (0.72 Å) could enter the lattice of nickel oxide and substitute Ni2+ (0.69 Å) sites, which results in lattice distortion."

[4] "XPS measurements were performed to obtain information about the oxidation state and chemical environment of the elements on the surface of NiZrO nanoparticles."

[5] "The XPS results clearly indicate that the chemical valence of nickel and zirconium ion on the surface has distinct variation for NiZrO compared with that of pure NiO or ZrO2 nanoparticles. It further confirms that there is a strong interaction between Zr and Ni, which may have a strong effect on the catalytic performance."

[6] "After the addition of Zr, the reduction peaks became broader and shifted to high temperature. For 5% Ni–ZrO catalyst, the shoulder peak at about 355◦C might be ascribed the reduction of NiO–Ni. Compared with pure NiO, the temperature was increased approximately 125◦C because of a weak interaction at the interface of NiO/ZrO2."

[7] "Based on the characterization results of TPR, XRD, and XPS, it can be found that there is a strong interaction between Ni and Zr, which influences the physicochemical property and consequently the behavior of catalyst."

[8] "No XRD peaks corresponding to ZrO2 were detected, suggesting that the ZrO2 species probably were highly dispersed in NiO."

[9] "The quantitative results of the XPS analyses are also summarized in Table 1. The values of the surface composition were derived from the integration of the Ni2p, Zr3d, and O1s core-level photoemission spectra, using the appropriate sensitivity correction factors."

          The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include:

1. X-ray diffraction (XRD): Used to analyze changes in cell parameters, crystal structure, and detect new phases. It can confirm dopant incorporation through lattice distortions and absence of separate dopant phases.

2. Scanning/high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (SEM/HRTEM): Provides visual confirmation of particle size, morphology, and dopant distribution.

3. BET surface area analysis: Measures changes in surface area due to dopant incorporation.

4. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR): Reveals changes in reducibility of the catalyst due to dopant interaction, such as peak broadening and temperature shifts.

5. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS): Provides information on oxidation states, chemical environment, and surface composition of elements. It can confirm dopant-host interactions and quantify surface composition.

6. O2 temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD): Analyzes changes in oxygen species distribution due to dopant incorporation.

These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by:

1. Confirming dopant incorporation into the host lattice (XRD, HRTEM)
2. Analyzing changes in electronic structure and chemical environment (XPS)
3. Measuring alterations in surface properties and reactivity (BET, TPR, TPD)
4. Providing quantitative data on dopant concentration and distribution (XPS, HRTEM)
5. Demonstrating changes in reducibility and oxygen species distribution (H2-TPR, O2-TPD)
6. Revealing strong interactions between dopant and host material (XPS, XRD, TPR)

By combining these methods, researchers can rule out alternative explanations (such as surface segregation or inhomogeneous distribution) and establish a direct link between dopant incorporation, structural modifications, and improved catalytic performance. The complementary nature of these techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of the dopant's role in altering the catalyst's physicochemical properties and catalytic behavior.

          验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂成功掺入和均匀分布的关键综合表征方法和分析方法包括：

1. X射线衍射（XRD）：用于分析晶胞参数和晶体结构的变化，检测新相。可以通过晶格畸变和缺少单独的掺杂剂相来确认掺杂剂的掺入。

2. 扫描/高分辨透射电子显微镜（SEM/HRTEM）：提供粒子大小、形态和掺杂剂分布的直观确认。

3. BET比表面积分析：测量由于掺杂剂掺入导致的表面积变化。

4. H2程序升温还原（H2-TPR）：揭示由于掺杂剂相互作用导致的催化剂还原性变化，如峰宽化和温度偏移。

5. X射线光电子能谱（XPS）：提供元素的氧化态、化学环境和表面组成信息。可以确认掺杂剂-主体相互作用并量化表面组成。

6. O2程序升温脱附（O2-TPD）：分析由于掺杂剂掺入导致的氧物种分布变化。

这些技术通过以下方式解决了在确立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间明确关系的挑战：

1. 确认掺杂剂已进入主体晶格（XRD，HRTEM）

4. 提供掺杂剂浓度和分布的定量数据（XPS，HRTEM）
5. 证明还原性和氧物种分布的变化（H2-TPR，O2-TPD）
6. 揭示掺杂剂和主体材料之间的强相互作用（XPS，XRD，TPR）

通过结合这些方法，研究人员可以排除其他解释（如表面偏析或不均匀分布），并建立掺杂剂掺入、结构修饰和催化性能改善之间的直接联系。这些技术的互补性提供了对掺杂剂在改变催化剂的物理化学性质和催化行为中的作用的全面理解。
