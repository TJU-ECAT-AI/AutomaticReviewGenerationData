          [1] "X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were collected using a Philips XPert diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator, operating at 40 kV and 45 mA and employing nickel-filtered CuKα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm)."

[2] "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and EDX microanalyses were performed on a JEOL JSM 6300 LINK ISIS instrument. The quantitative EDX analysis was performed using an Oxford LINK ISIS System with the SEMQUANT program, which introduces the ZAF correction."

[3] "Photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a VG-Escalab-210 Spectrometer using AlKα radiation (AlKα = 1486 eV) operated at 12 kV and 20 mA."

[4] "Sb LI edge XANES spectra were acquired at room temperature at the line D42, XAS 13 beamline, at the LURE Synchrotron Radiation facility (Orsay, Paris) using a double crystal Si (311) monochromator, detuned until 50%."

[5] "Infrared spectra of adsorbed ammonia were obtained in a Bio-Rad Fis-4017 spectrophotometer."

[6] "Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra (EPR) were recorded with a Bruker ER-200D spectrometer working in the X-band and calibrated with a DPPH standard (g = 2.0036)."

[7] "No significant differences are appreciated in the XRD patterns when comparing undoped and K-doped MoVSbO samples (Fig. 1b), although changes in the proportion between Sb2Mo10O31/Sb4Mo10O30 or the presence of (SbO)2M20-O56/(Sb2O)M6O18 cannot be detected by XRD."

[8] "The incorporation of potassium by impregnation nor a second heat-treatment in N2 at 773 K for 1 h have a strong influence on the specific surface area of MoVSb-based catalysts."

[9] "While the addition of potassium to the MoVSb oxide does not appear to have a strong influence on the surface composition and the nature of V2p or Mo3d XPS spectra, a different behavior is inferred for Sb, according to the Sb3d XPS spectra (Fig. 4)."

          The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include:

1. X-ray Diffraction (XRD): Provides information on crystalline structure and phases, but may have limitations in detecting minor changes or certain phase proportions.

2. Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX): Allows for morphological analysis and elemental mapping to assess dopant distribution and quantification.

3. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): Offers surface composition analysis and information on oxidation states of elements.

4. X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES): Provides insights into local electronic structure and oxidation states of specific elements.

5. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) with adsorbed probe molecules: Helps characterize surface properties and acidity changes due to doping.

6. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR): Useful for studying paramagnetic species and their local environment.

These techniques address the challenges in establishing clear relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by:

1. Providing complementary information at different scales (bulk, surface, local environment).
2. Allowing detection of subtle changes in structure, composition, and electronic properties.
3. Enabling quantification of dopant concentration and distribution.

However, limitations exist:
1. Some techniques (e.g., XRD) may not detect minor phases or changes in proportion between similar phases.
2. Surface-sensitive techniques (e.g., XPS) may not represent bulk properties.

To rule out alternative explanations, it's crucial to:
1. Combine multiple characterization techniques and correlate their results.
2. Use appropriate standards and careful sample preparation.
3. Conduct in-situ or operando studies to understand catalyst behavior under reaction conditions.
4. Correlate characterization results with catalytic performance data.

This comprehensive approach helps establish clear relationships between dopant incorporation, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic activity while minimizing alternative explanations.

          对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功引入和均匀分布，以下综合表征方法和分析方法至关重要：

1. X射线衍射（XRD）：提供晶体结构和相信息，但在检测微小变化或某些相比例方面可能存在限制。

2. 扫描电子显微镜与能量色散X射线（SEM-EDX）：允许进行形态分析和元素映射，以评估掺杂剂的分布和定量。

3. X射线光电子能谱（XPS）：提供表面成分分析和元素氧化态信息。

4. X射线吸收近边结构（XANES）：提供特定元素局部电子结构和氧化态的洞察。

5. 傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）与吸附探针分子：有助于表征表面性质和因掺杂引起的酸度变化。

6. 电子顺磁共振（EPR）：用于研究顺磁物种及其局部环境。

这些技术通过以下方式解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间明确关系的挑战：

1. 在不同尺度（体相、表面、局部环境）提供互补信息。
2. 允许检测结构、成分和电子性质的微妙变化。
3. 能够量化掺杂剂浓度和分布。

然而，存在一些限制：
1. 某些技术（如XRD）可能无法检测到微量相或类似相之间比例的变化。
2. 表面敏感技术（如XPS）可能无法代表体相性质。

为排除其他解释，至关重要的是：
1. 结合多种表征技术并关联其结果。
2. 使用适当的标准和仔细的样品制备。
3. 进行原位或操作条件下的研究，以了解催化剂在反应条件下的行为。
4. 将表征结果与催化性能数据相关联。

这种综合方法有助于建立掺杂剂掺入、结构变化和催化活性增强之间的明确关系，同时最大限度地减少替代解释。
