[1] "IR spectroscopy can provide valuable and pertinent information on the adsorption sites on a catalyst, both directly or via the adsorption of adapted probe molecules (the best probe is always the reactants themselves). Physicalchemical properties of the sites can be described and ranked vs. reference compounds: acidity, basicity, redox properties are verified and quantified in strength and as site concentrations."

          [2] "Different operando techniques can complete such a view discriminating which sites play a role in the catalytic reaction, behaving as active sites or just hosting reacting agents or products."

          [3] "Studying very short lived intermediates cannot be done with standard catalytic setups and spectrometers. Both parameters have to be controlled, the time resolution of the catalytic setup, and of the spectroscopic observation."

          [4] "As shown out by Weckhuysen in his recent review about spatial resolution in catalysis, the few tentative studies of monitoring a catalyst by infrared light use IR microscopy. This technique is detailed in another contribution of this issue. It is interesting to remark that using synchrotron light in spite of a classical IR source, the spatial resolution is significantly boosted, allowing to catch sites in action at an impressive spatial resolution, such as distinguishing between the different morphological elements of a zeolitic single-crystal."

[1] "HS-LEIS compares favorably to XPS (ESCA) since the information depth for XPS is several nanometers (20 layers) whereas HS-LEIS is specific for the outermost atomic layer."

          [2] "HS-LEIS also compares favorably to SIMS, since quantification of HS-LEIS results is straightforward."

          [3] "The HS-LEIS instrument is very sensitive and typically exhibits detection limits on the order of several ppm for high values of m2/m1, while mass resolution is good for low values of m2/m1."

          [4] "As long as the experimental conditions are chosen with care (Ei cannot be too low, u is large and no grazing angles are used), for a given primary ion, primary ion energy and scattering surface atom, the HS-LEIS peak is proportional to the amount of scattering surface atoms [3]. This means that quantification is straightforward."

          [5] "HS-LEIS is orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional LEIS. In HS-LEIS, the scattered ions are collected from all azimuth angles and the HS-LEIS analyzer is imaging the ions onto a position sensitive detector."

[2] "The characterization results indicated that cerium doping could deform the spinel structure and cause redistribution of metal ions with different oxidation states; consequently, they would increase crystal defects and oxygen vacancy concentration, which facilitate oxygen mobility and thus increase the catalytic performance of cerium modified cobalt chromite catalysts."

[3] "The bulk structure was determined by Raman and XRD and the phase segregation was studied by SEM. The reducibility was studied by CH4 TPR-MS. The oxygen desorption behavior was studied by O2-TPD. The chemical states and surface composition has been analyzed using XPS."

"The methods of characterization need to answer the following questions. Is the active catalyst a homogeneously doped oxide with some dopant in the surface layer? Are we sure that the dopant did not make very small oxide clusters on the surface? Can we rule out the presence of two phases? Are we sure that catalytic activity is not due to impurities in the precursors?"

"It is difficult to establish beyond doubt that (1) a true homogeneously doped oxide has been synthesized, and (2) it is the homogeneously doped phase that is responsible for the observed catalytic activity."

"XRD can identify whether or not a single crystalline phase is present to within the resolution of the instruments (typically >1%). Peak widths are fit to the DebyeScherrer equation to determine crystallite size. Shifts due to substitutional doping are often interpreted using Vegards rule, which states that there is a linear relationship between the concentration of a substitutional dopant and the change in the lattice parameter."

"EXAFS has been used to study the bulk properties of doped oxides, and it is capable of providing the location of the dopant in the solid (e.g., substitutional or interstitial) and the positions of its neighbors."

"XPS is generally performed in vacuum and is typically ex situ; thus the oxidation states measured may not reflect the electronic environment under reaction conditions. When used in conjunction with XRD and other means of determining bulk ratios of host:dopant atoms, XPS data can (i) determine the surface concentration of the dopant, and (ii) provide the oxidation states of the atoms located on the surface or in several layers near the surface."

"UVvis can be used to establish the presence of isolated dopant cations within a metal oxide. The spectra of the metal ions are interpreted by ligand field theory: ions with tetrahedral coordination are readily differentiated from octahedrally coordinated ones."

[4] "The LEIS measurements were made at room temperature with 3 keV 4He+ ions to determine concentrations of the impurities on the surface. Since Y and Zr are neighbors in the periodic system, it is impossible to separate them with He ion scattering. The Y2O3 content is determined, therefore, with 5-keV 20Ne+ ions."

[5] "The Y2O3 concentration on the surface was estimated by fitting LEIS spectra of YSZ."

[6] "The major contaminations detected by XRF were TiO2 and HfO2, which were found in all samples."

[2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and the chemical environment of the catalysts, indicating the existence of strong interaction between Ni and Zr."

[3] "The cell parameters variation was calculated by the peak positions of NiO-like phase by Debye–Scherrer method. The results, listed in Table 1, show that the cell parameter of the catalysts increased with the increasing Zr content up to 10%. Such increase indicates that larger Zr4+ ions (0.72 Å) could enter the lattice of nickel oxide and substitute Ni2+ (0.69 Å) sites, which results in lattice distortion."

[4] "XPS measurements were performed to obtain information about the oxidation state and chemical environment of the elements on the surface of NiZrO nanoparticles."

[5] "The XPS results clearly indicate that the chemical valence of nickel and zirconium ion on the surface has distinct variation for NiZrO compared with that of pure NiO or ZrO2 nanoparticles. It further confirms that there is a strong interaction between Zr and Ni, which may have a strong effect on the catalytic performance."

[6] "After the addition of Zr, the reduction peaks became broader and shifted to high temperature. For 5% Ni–ZrO catalyst, the shoulder peak at about 355◦C might be ascribed the reduction of NiO–Ni. Compared with pure NiO, the temperature was increased approximately 125◦C because of a weak interaction at the interface of NiO/ZrO2."

[7] "Based on the characterization results of TPR, XRD, and XPS, it can be found that there is a strong interaction between Ni and Zr, which influences the physicochemical property and consequently the behavior of catalyst."

[8] "No XRD peaks corresponding to ZrO2 were detected, suggesting that the ZrO2 species probably were highly dispersed in NiO."

[6] "Moving to the analysis of DRIFTS, Fig. 5AC show that, after the surface reduction process, adsorption of CO leads to reaction with bridging OH groups to produce surface formate bands, in agreement with earlier studies."

[7] "Assuming a first order decay of the formate, we estimated the first order rate constant based on 0.15-life (i.e. 85% formate decomposition) results. The total active sites, based on the initial formate intensities, decreases with Zr addition (Table 4). However, the rate of their decomposition, passes through a maximum at 50% Zr addition."

[1] "The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy."

[2] "High-resolution XRD studies of 3 and 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 do not show CuO lines in their respective patterns. The structure could be refined for the composition Ce1-xCuxO2-δ (x = 0.03 and 0.05; δ  0.13 and 0.16) in the fluorite structure with 58% oxide ion vacancy."

[3] "EPR as well as XPS studies confirm the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix. Redox potentials of Cu species in the CeO2 matrix are lower than those in CuO."

[1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts."

[2] "The changes observed in the size of the NiO unit cell in the mixed oxides indicate the incorporation of the dopants in the NiO structure and the formation of NiMeO solid solutions."

[3] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordination of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides."

[4] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts."

[5] "Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the principle of controlled valence and clearly confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor."

[6] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."

[1] "In situ-EPR, in situ-UVVIS spectroscopy and on line-GC have been for the first time simultaneously combined to follow the behaviour of lanthanum-doped CrOx/ZrO2 and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."

          [2] "The fourth chapter jumps to a discussion of the characterization of metal valence states using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-filtered imaging in transmission electron microscopy, illustrated with several well-chosen examples."

          [3] "Also woven into this chapter is a section on resonant X-ray scattering, but the presentation is focused on orbital ordering phenomena in manganites and thus is not likely to be informative for the typical reader. This is unfortunate since the same technique can be a very powerful tool for applications in oxide characterization for cases where elemental distributions are difficult to resolve with conventional (off-edge) X-ray diffraction."

[3] "BET surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K with a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument."

[4] "The LEIS measurements were made at room temperature with 3 keV 4He+ ions to determine concentrations of the impurities on the surface. Since Y and Zr are neighbors in the periodic system, it is impossible to separate them with He ion scattering. The Y2O3 content is determined, therefore, with 5-keV 20Ne+ ions."

[5] "The Y2O3 concentration on the surface was estimated by fitting LEIS spectra of YSZ."

[6] "The major contaminations detected by XRF were TiO2 and HfO2, which were found in all samples."

[1] "High-resolution XRD shows the absence of the Pd metal or PdO diffraction line in 1 at. % Pd/CeO2 forming a solid solution, Ce1-xPdxO2-δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.03)."

[2] "Rietveld refinement confirms the oxide ion vacancy in 1 at. % Pd/CeO2."

[3] "XPS studies show that Pd is in a highly ionic Pd2+ state in 1 at. % Pd/CeO2."

[4] "XANES of catalysts show that a Pd2+-like species is present in the catalysts."

[5] "EXAFS analysis proves that Pd2+ ions are substituted for Ce4+ sites with oxide ion vacancy around Pd2+ ion."

[1] "NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents were prepared by a modified sol–gel method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning/high-resolution transmission electron microscope (SEM/HRTEM), BET surface area analysis, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and O2 temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD)."

[2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and the chemical environment of the catalysts, indicating the existence of strong interaction between Ni and Zr."

[3] "The cell parameters variation was calculated by the peak positions of NiO-like phase by Debye–Scherrer method. The results, listed in Table 1, show that the cell parameter of the catalysts increased with the increasing Zr content up to 10%. Such increase indicates that larger Zr4+ ions (0.72 Å) could enter the lattice of nickel oxide and substitute Ni2+ (0.69 Å) sites, which results in lattice distortion."

[4] "XPS measurements were performed to obtain information about the oxidation state and chemical environment of the elements on the surface of NiZrO nanoparticles."

[5] "The XPS results clearly indicate that the chemical valence of nickel and zirconium ion on the surface has distinct variation for NiZrO compared with that of pure NiO or ZrO2 nanoparticles. It further confirms that there is a strong interaction between Zr and Ni, which may have a strong effect on the catalytic performance."

[6] "After the addition of Zr, the reduction peaks became broader and shifted to high temperature. For 5% Ni–ZrO catalyst, the shoulder peak at about 355◦C might be ascribed the reduction of NiO–Ni. Compared with pure NiO, the temperature was increased approximately 125◦C because of a weak interaction at the interface of NiO/ZrO2."

[7] "Based on the characterization results of TPR, XRD, and XPS, it can be found that there is a strong interaction between Ni and Zr, which influences the physicochemical property and consequently the behavior of catalyst."

[8] "No XRD peaks corresponding to ZrO2 were detected, suggesting that the ZrO2 species probably were highly dispersed in NiO."

[9] "The quantitative results of the XPS analyses are also summarized in Table 1. The values of the surface composition were derived from the integration of the Ni2p, Zr3d, and O1s core-level photoemission spectra, using the appropriate sensitivity correction factors."

[1] "XPS results, normalized to subtract out the signal from carbon, are depicted in Fig. 1AC and Table 2. The results are for the binary oxides prior to loading of metal promoter."

[2] "EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively."

[3] "To verify that a true facilitation in the reduction of the ceria component occurred, XANES was employed, and results are depicted in Fig. 4A and B."

[7] "Assuming a first order decay of the formate, we estimated the first order rate constant based on 0.15-life (i.e. 85% formate decomposition) results. The total active sites, based on the initial formate intensities, decreases with Zr addition (Table 4). However, the rate of their decomposition, passes through a maximum at 50% Zr addition."

[1] "The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy."

[2] "High-resolution XRD studies of 3 and 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 do not show CuO lines in their respective patterns. The structure could be refined for the composition Ce1-xCuxO2-δ (x = 0.03 and 0.05; δ  0.13 and 0.16) in the fluorite structure with 58% oxide ion vacancy."

[3] "EPR as well as XPS studies confirm the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix. Redox potentials of Cu species in the CeO2 matrix are lower than those in CuO."

[4] "EXAFS investigations of these catalysts show an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion."

[5] "The present results provide direct evidence for the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ type of solid solution phase having Cu2+OCe4+ kind of linkages."

[1] "XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."

[9] "The enhanced catalytic activity of Rh/CeO2 is shown to be due to the formation of a Ce1-xRhxO2-δ type of solid solution with Rh3+OCe4+ kind of linkages on the surface."

[1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts."

[2] "The changes observed in the size of the NiO unit cell in the mixed oxides indicate the incorporation of the dopants in the NiO structure and the formation of NiMeO solid solutions."

[3] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordination of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides."

[4] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts."

[5] "Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the principle of controlled valence and clearly confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor."

[6] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."

[1] "In situ-EPR, in situ-UVVIS spectroscopy and on line-GC have been for the first time simultaneously combined to follow the behaviour of lanthanum-doped CrOx/ZrO2 and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."

[2] "These techniques provide complementary information on the structure and valence state of transition metal ions (TMI) during reaction."

[3] "For example, Cr6+ species are not visible by EPR but do give rise to intense charge-transfer (CT) transitions in the UVVIS spectrum while EPR is able to distinguish between Cr5+ and Cr3+ sites of different structure."

[4] "XPS measurements that reveal a markedly lower Cr concentration on the surface than in the bulk already for the as-synthesized catalyst which is expected to decrease even more upon reduction during time on stream."

[5] "Crystalline phase analyses were performed by X-ray powder diffraction using a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu K radiation in the 2θ range 1090."

[1] "Chapter 5 is the evaluation of surface composition, which is a critical issue for understanding the catalytic chemistry on transition-metal oxide surfaces and is an area in which unambiguous characterization poses some very significant challenges."

          [2] "The fourth chapter jumps to a discussion of the characterization of metal valence states using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-filtered imaging in transmission electron microscopy, illustrated with several well-chosen examples."

          [3] "Also woven into this chapter is a section on resonant X-ray scattering, but the presentation is focused on orbital ordering phenomena in manganites and thus is not likely to be informative for the typical reader. This is unfortunate since the same technique can be a very powerful tool for applications in oxide characterization for cases where elemental distributions are difficult to resolve with conventional (off-edge) X-ray diffraction."

          [4] "Chapter 6 is the longest of the contributions, providing a very nice overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides. It is perhaps the most important chapter in this volume in terms of utility for those needing a general introduction to the fundamentals of bulk metal oxides."
