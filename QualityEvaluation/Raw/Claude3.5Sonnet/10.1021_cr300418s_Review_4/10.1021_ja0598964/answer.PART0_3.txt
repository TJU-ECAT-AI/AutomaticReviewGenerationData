[1] "Chapter 5 is the evaluation of surface composition, which is a critical issue for understanding the catalytic chemistry on transition-metal oxide surfaces and is an area in which unambiguous characterization poses some very significant challenges."

[2] "Chapter 4 jumps to a discussion of the characterization of metal valence states using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-filtered imaging in transmission electron microscopy, illustrated with several well-chosen examples."

[3] "Chapter 6 is the longest of the contributions, providing a very nice overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides."

[4] "Also woven into this chapter is a section on resonant X-ray scattering, but the presentation is focused on orbital ordering phenomena in manganites and thus is not likely to be informative for the typical reader. This is unfortunate since the same technique can be a very powerful tool for applications in oxide characterization for cases where elemental distributions are difficult to resolve with conventional (off-edge) X-ray diffraction."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive list of characterization methods specifically for verifying dopant incorporation in metal oxide catalysts. However, it mentions several analytical techniques that are crucial for characterizing metal oxides in general, which could be applied to studying doped catalysts:

1. Surface composition evaluation is described as critical for understanding catalytic chemistry on transition-metal oxide surfaces, though it poses significant challenges for unambiguous characterization.

2. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-filtered imaging in transmission electron microscopy are mentioned as methods for characterizing metal valence states.

3. Resonant X-ray scattering is noted as a powerful tool for oxide characterization, particularly for resolving elemental distributions that are difficult to detect with conventional X-ray diffraction.

4. The text also emphasizes the importance of understanding the electronic structure of metal oxides.

While these techniques are not explicitly linked to dopant incorporation or distribution in the text, they could potentially be used to address these aspects. The literature does not directly discuss how these methods relate to establishing relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and catalytic performance, nor does it mention ruling out alternative explanations. To fully answer the question, additional information from other sources would be required.

文献并没有提供专门用于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂掺入的全面表征方法列表。然而，它提到了几种对于表征金属氧化物至关重要的分析技术，这些技术可以应用于研究掺杂催化剂：

1. 表面组成评估被描述为理解过渡金属氧化物表面催化化学的关键，尽管它对于明确表征构成重大挑战。

2. 电子能量损失谱（EELS）和透射电子显微镜中的能量过滤成像被提及为表征金属价态的方法。

3. 共振X射线散射被注意到是氧化物表征的强大工具，特别是对于解析难以用常规X射线衍射检测的元素分布。

4. 文本还强调了理解金属氧化物电子结构的重要性。

虽然这些技术在文本中并没有明确与掺杂剂的掺入或分布联系起来，但它们可能被用来研究这些方面。文献没有直接讨论这些方法如何与建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能之间的关系相关，也没有提到排除替代解释。要全面回答这个问题，需要从其他来源获取额外信息。
