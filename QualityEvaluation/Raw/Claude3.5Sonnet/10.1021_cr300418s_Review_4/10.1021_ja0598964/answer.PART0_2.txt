[1] "The fourth chapter jumps to a discussion of the characterization of metal valence states using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-filtered imaging in transmission electron microscopy, illustrated with several well-chosen examples."

[2] "Chapter 5 is the evaluation of surface composition, which is a critical issue for understanding the catalytic chemistry on transition-metal oxide surfaces and is an area in which unambiguous characterization poses some very significant challenges."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive answer to the specific question about characterization methods for verifying dopant incorporation in metal oxide catalysts. However, it mentions two relevant analytical techniques:

1. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-filtered imaging in transmission electron microscopy are discussed as methods for characterizing metal valence states.

2. Surface composition evaluation is mentioned as critical for understanding catalytic chemistry on transition-metal oxide surfaces, though it is noted that unambiguous characterization in this area poses significant challenges.

These techniques could potentially be applied to study dopant incorporation and distribution in metal oxide catalysts, but the text does not explicitly discuss their use for this purpose or how they address the challenges in relating dopant presence to structural changes and catalytic performance.

该文献并未对验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂掺入的综合表征方法提供全面答案。然而，它提到了两种相关的分析技术：

1. 提到了电子能量损失谱(EELS)和透射电子显微镜中的能量过滤成像作为表征金属价态的方法。

2. 提到表面成分评估对理解过渡金属氧化物表面的催化化学至关重要，但指出在这一领域进行明确表征存在重大挑战。

这些技术可能适用于研究金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的掺入和分布，但文本并未明确讨论它们在这方面的应用，或它们如何解决将掺杂剂存在与结构变化和催化性能增强联系起来的挑战。
