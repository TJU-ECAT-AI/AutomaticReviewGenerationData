[1] "X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were collected using a Philips XPert diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator, operating at 40 kV and 45 mA and employing nickel-filtered CuKα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm)."

[2] "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and EDX microanalyses were performed on a JEOL JSM 6300 LINK ISIS instrument. The quantitative EDX analysis was performed using an Oxford LINK ISIS System with the SEMQUANT program, which introduces the ZAF correction."

[3] "Photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a VG-Escalab-210 Spectrometer using AlKα radiation (AlKα = 1486 eV) operated at 12 kV and 20 mA."

[4] "Sb LI edge XANES spectra were acquired at room temperature at the line D42, XAS 13 beamline, at the LURE Synchrotron Radiation facility (Orsay, Paris) using a double crystal Si (311) monochromator, detuned until 50%."

[5] "No significant differences are appreciated in the XRD patterns when comparing undoped and K-doped MoVSbO samples (Fig. 1b), although changes in the proportion between Sb2Mo10O31/Sb4Mo10O30 or the presence of (SbO)2M20-O56/(Sb2O)M6O18 cannot be detected by XRD."

[6] "The incorporation of potassium by impregnation nor a second heat-treatment in N2 at 773 K for 1 h have a strong influence on the specific surface area of MoVSb-based catalysts."

[7] "While the addition of potassium to the MoVSb oxide does not appear to have a strong influence on the surface composition and the nature of V2p or Mo3d XPS spectra, a different behavior is inferred for Sb, according to the Sb3d XPS spectra (Fig. 4)."

Comprehensive characterization methods crucial for verifying successful dopant incorporation and distribution in metal oxide catalysts include:

1. X-ray Diffraction (XRD): Provides information on crystalline phases but may not detect minor changes in structure or composition.

2. Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX): Allows for morphological analysis and elemental mapping to assess dopant distribution.

3. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): Provides information on surface composition and oxidation states of elements.

4. X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES): Offers insight into the local chemical environment and oxidation states of specific elements.

5. Infrared Spectroscopy (IR): Can detect changes in chemical bonds upon dopant incorporation.

6. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR): Useful for studying paramagnetic species and their local environment.

These techniques address challenges in establishing relationships between dopant presence, structural changes, and catalytic performance by:

1. Providing complementary information on bulk and surface properties.
2. Allowing for detection of subtle changes in oxidation states and local environments.
3. Enabling quantification of dopant concentrations and distribution.

However, limitations exist:

1. XRD may not detect minor phases or changes in proportion between similar phases.
2. Surface-sensitive techniques like XPS may not represent bulk properties.
3. Some techniques may not be sensitive enough to detect low dopant concentrations.

To rule out alternative explanations, it's crucial to combine multiple characterization techniques and correlate results with catalytic performance data. This comprehensive approach helps establish clear relationships between dopant incorporation, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic activity.

对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布，以下综合表征方法至关重要：

1. X射线衍射（XRD）：提供晶相信息，但可能无法检测到结构或成分的微小变化。

2. 扫描电子显微镜与能量色散X射线（SEM-EDX）：允许进行形态分析和元素映射，以评估掺杂剂的分布。

3. X射线光电子能谱（XPS）：提供表面成分和元素氧化态的信息。

4. X射线吸收近边结构（XANES）：提供特定元素的局部化学环境和氧化态的洞察。

5. 红外光谱（IR）：可检测掺杂剂掺入后化学键的变化。

6. 电子顺磁共振（EPR）：用于研究顺磁物种及其局部环境。

这些技术通过以下方式解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能之间关系的挑战：

1. 提供体相和表面性质的互补信息。
2. 允许检测氧化态和局部环境的微妙变化。
3. 能够量化掺杂剂浓度和分布。

然而，存在一些限制：

1. XRD可能无法检测到微量相或类似相之间比例的变化。
2. 像XPS这样的表面敏感技术可能无法代表体相性质。
3. 某些技术可能不够敏感，无法检测低浓度的掺杂剂。

为排除其他解释，结合多种表征技术并将结果与催化性能数据相关联至关重要。这种综合方法有助于建立掺杂剂掺入、结构变化和催化活性增强之间的明确关系。
