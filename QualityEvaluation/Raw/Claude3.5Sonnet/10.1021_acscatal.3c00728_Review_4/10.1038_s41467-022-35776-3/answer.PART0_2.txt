[1] "Prior studies have reported that the exceptional product distribution on h-BN catalyst is ascribed to the combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals and subsequent gaseous reactions"

[2] "Given the BOx species were considered to be able to produce highly reactive radicals and release them to gas phase, the BOx sites formed on the BN surface may play a role in increasing the concentration of active species with the assistance of oxygen, e.g. propyl peroxide (C3H7OOH), which may be easily formed by rebound of peroxyl and propyl radicals and then released to the gas phase to react with propylene."

[3] "The unique synergistic activation of propane and ethane over BN was attributed to the mechanism with the co-presence and co-operation of surface-mediated radical formation processes and gas-phase channels, which was different from the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism of redox metal oxides and adsorbed oxygen mechanism of rare-earth oxide."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. This mechanism is characterized by the formation of radicals on the catalyst surface, which are then released into the gas phase to participate in subsequent reactions.

The synergistic effects between surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contribute significantly to catalyst performance. The BOx sites on the BN surface play a crucial role in generating highly reactive radicals, which are then released into the gas phase. These radicals, such as propyl peroxide (C3H7OOH), can further react with olefins like propylene, creating a complex network of reactions that enhance overall catalytic activity.

This unique mechanism distinguishes B-based catalysts from traditional catalysts that follow the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or adsorbed oxygen mechanism. The co-presence and co-operation of surface-mediated radical formation and gas-phase channels result in exceptional product distribution and improved catalytic performance.

The implications for catalyst design optimization are significant. Understanding this multidimensional mechanism allows for the development of catalysts that can effectively balance surface radical formation and gas-phase reactions. This could lead to the design of catalysts with improved selectivity towards desired products and higher overall efficiency. Furthermore, this mechanistic insight provides opportunities for fine-tuning reaction conditions to maximize the synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase processes, potentially leading to more efficient and selective ODHP reactions.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，为整体反应网络提供了全面的理解。这种机理的特点是在催化剂表面形成自由基，然后释放到气相中参与后续反应。

表面介导和气相反应之间的协同效应对催化剂性能有显著贡献。BN表面上的BOx位点在产生高活性自由基方面起着关键作用，这些自由基随后被释放到气相中。这些自由基，如丙基过氧化物（C3H7OOH），可以进一步与丙烯等烯烃反应，形成复杂的反应网络，提高整体催化活性。

这种独特的机理使B基催化剂区别于遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理或吸附氧机理的传统催化剂。表面介导自由基形成和气相通道的共存和协同作用导致了异常的产物分布和改进的催化性能。

对催化剂设计优化的影响是显著的。理解这种多维机理允许开发能够有效平衡表面自由基形成和气相反应的催化剂。这可能导致设计出对目标产物具有更高选择性和整体效率更高的催化剂。此外，这种机理洞察为微调反应条件以最大化表面和气相过程之间的协同效应提供了机会，可能导致更高效和选择性的ODHP反应。
