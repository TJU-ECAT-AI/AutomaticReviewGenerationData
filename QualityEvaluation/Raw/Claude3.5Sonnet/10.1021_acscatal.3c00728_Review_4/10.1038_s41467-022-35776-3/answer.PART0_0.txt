[1] "Prior studies have reported that the exceptional product distribution on h-BN catalyst is ascribed to the combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals and subsequent gaseous reactions"

[2] "Given the BOx species were considered to be able to produce highly reactive radicals and release them to gas phase, the BOx sites formed on the BN surface may play a role in increasing the concentration of active species with the assistance of oxygen, e.g. propyl peroxide (C3H7OOH), which may be easily formed by rebound of peroxyl and propyl radicals and then released to the gas phase to react with propylene."

[3] "The unique synergistic activation of propane and ethane over BN was attributed to the mechanism with the co-presence and co-operation of surface-mediated radical formation processes and gas-phase channels, which was different from the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism of redox metal oxides and adsorbed oxygen mechanism of rare-earth oxide."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex reaction network. This synergy between surface-mediated radical formation and subsequent gas-phase reactions contributes to the exceptional product distribution observed with h-BN catalysts.

The BOx sites on the BN surface play a crucial role in generating highly reactive radicals, which are then released into the gas phase. These radicals, such as propyl peroxide (C3H7OOH), can further react with other species like propylene, creating a dynamic interplay between surface and gas-phase processes.

This unique mechanism, combining surface-mediated radical formation and gas-phase channels, sets B-based catalysts apart from traditional catalysts that follow mechanisms like Mars-van Krevelen or adsorbed oxygen. The synergistic effects of these processes have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Enhanced activity: The cooperation between surface and gas-phase reactions can lead to higher overall catalytic activity.

2. Improved selectivity: The interplay between different reaction pathways can be tuned to favor desired products.

3. Lower operating temperatures: The synergistic effects may allow for efficient catalysis at reduced temperatures.

4. Novel catalyst designs: Understanding this multidimensional mechanism can guide the development of new catalyst structures that optimize both surface and gas-phase reactions.

5. Process intensification: The complex reaction network may offer opportunities for process integration and intensification in industrial applications.

By leveraging this comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism, researchers can design more efficient and selective B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions, potentially leading to improved processes for olefin production.

基于硼的催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，为复杂的反应网络提供了全面的理解。表面介导的自由基形成和随后的气相反应之间的这种协同作用，有助于解释在h-BN催化剂上观察到的异常产物分布。

BN表面上的BOx位点在产生高活性自由基方面起着至关重要的作用，这些自由基随后被释放到气相中。这些自由基，如丙基过氧化物（C3H7OOH），可以进一步与其他物种如丙烯反应，创造了表面过程和气相过程之间的动态相互作用。

这种独特的机制，结合了表面介导的自由基形成和气相通道，使基于硼的催化剂与遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制或吸附氧机制的传统催化剂区分开来。这些过程的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 增强活性：表面和气相反应之间的协作可以导致更高的整体催化活性。

2. 改善选择性：不同反应路径之间的相互作用可以被调节以有利于目标产物。

3. 降低操作温度：协同效应可能允许在较低温度下进行高效催化。

4. 新型催化剂设计：理解这种多维机制可以指导开发新的催化剂结构，优化表面和气相反应。

5. 过程强化：复杂的反应网络可能为工业应用中的过程集成和强化提供机会。

通过利用对反应机理的全面理解，研究人员可以设计更高效、更选择性的基于硼的ODHP反应催化剂，潜在地改进烯烃生产工艺。
