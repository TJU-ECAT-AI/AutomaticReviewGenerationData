[1] "Prior studies have reported that the exceptional product distribution on h-BN catalyst is ascribed to the combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals and subsequent gaseous reactions"

[2] "Given the BOx species were considered to be able to produce highly reactive radicals and release them to gas phase, the BOx sites formed on the BN surface may play a role in increasing the concentration of active species with the assistance of oxygen, e.g. propyl peroxide (C3H7OOH), which may be easily formed by rebound of peroxyl and propyl radicals and then released to the gas phase to react with propylene."

[3] "The unique synergistic activation of propane and ethane over BN was attributed to the mechanism with the co-presence and co-operation of surface-mediated radical formation processes and gas-phase channels, which was different from the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism of redox metal oxides and adsorbed oxygen mechanism of rare-earth oxide."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. This mechanism combines surface-mediated formation of radicals with subsequent gaseous reactions, which is distinct from traditional catalytic mechanisms.

The synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions contribute significantly to catalyst performance. BOx species on the BN surface produce highly reactive radicals and release them into the gas phase, increasing the concentration of active species. This process, assisted by oxygen, leads to the formation of intermediates like propyl peroxide, which can then react with olefins in the gas phase.

This unique mechanism has important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. It allows for high olefin selectivity and alkane conversion simultaneously, which is challenging to achieve with traditional catalysts.

2. The mechanism enables the activation of alkanes at lower temperatures through the synergistic effect of in-situ formed olefins.

3. It offers opportunities for novel reaction engineering approaches, such as co-feeding strategies, to enhance catalyst performance.

4. The understanding of this mechanism can guide the design of new catalysts that can effectively balance surface and gas-phase reactions for optimal performance.

5. It highlights the importance of considering both surface properties and gas-phase chemistry when optimizing B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions.

This multidimensional mechanism opens up new possibilities for catalyst design and process optimization in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, potentially leading to more efficient and selective production of valuable olefins.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，提供了对整体反应网络的全面理解。这种机理结合了表面介导的自由基形成和随后的气相反应，这与传统的催化机理不同。

表面和气相反应之间的协同效应对催化剂性能有显著贡献。BN表面上的BOx物种产生高度活性的自由基并将其释放到气相中，增加了活性物种的浓度。这个过程在氧的辅助下，导致中间体如丙基过氧化物的形成，然后可以在气相中与烯烃反应。

这种独特的机理对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 它允许同时实现高烯烃选择性和烷烃转化率，这对传统催化剂来说是具有挑战性的。

2. 该机理通过原位形成烯烃的协同效应，能够在较低温度下活化烷烃。

3. 它为新型反应工程方法提供了机会，如共进料策略，以提高催化剂性能。

4. 对这种机理的理解可以指导新催化剂的设计，有效平衡表面和气相反应以获得最佳性能。

5. 它强调了在优化B基催化剂用于ODHP反应时，同时考虑表面性质和气相化学的重要性。

这种多维机理为烷烃氧化脱氢领域的催化剂设计和过程优化开辟了新的可能性，有望导致更高效和选择性的有价值烯烃生产。
