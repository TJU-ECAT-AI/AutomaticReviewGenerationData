[1] "Prior studies have reported that the exceptional product distribution on h-BN catalyst is ascribed to the combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals and subsequent gaseous reactions"

[2] "Given the BOx species were considered to be able to produce highly reactive radicals and release them to gas phase, the BOx sites formed on the BN surface may play a role in increasing the concentration of active species with the assistance of oxygen, e.g. propyl peroxide (C3H7OOH), which may be easily formed by rebound of peroxyl and propyl radicals and then released to the gas phase to react with propylene."

[3] "The unique synergistic activation of propane and ethane over BN was attributed to the mechanism with the co-presence and co-operation of surface-mediated radical formation processes and gas-phase channels, which was different from the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism of redox metal oxides and adsorbed oxygen mechanism of rare-earth oxide."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex reaction network. This synergy between surface-mediated radical formation and subsequent gas-phase reactions contributes to the exceptional product distribution observed with h-BN catalysts.

The BOx sites on the BN surface play a crucial role in generating highly reactive radicals, which are then released into the gas phase. These radicals, such as propyl peroxide (C3H7OOH), can further react with other species like propylene, creating a dynamic interplay between surface and gas-phase processes.

This unique mechanism, combining surface-mediated radical formation and gas-phase channels, sets B-based catalysts apart from traditional catalysts that follow mechanisms like Mars-van Krevelen or adsorbed oxygen. The synergistic effects of these processes have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Enhanced activity: The cooperation between surface and gas-phase reactions can lead to higher overall catalytic activity.

2. Improved selectivity: The interplay between different reaction pathways can be tuned to favor desired products.

3. Lower operating temperatures: The synergistic effects may allow for efficient catalysis at reduced temperatures.

4. Novel catalyst designs: Understanding this multidimensional mechanism can guide the development of new catalyst structures that optimize both surface and gas-phase reactions.

5. Process intensification: The complex reaction network may offer opportunities for process integration and intensification in industrial applications.

By leveraging this comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism, researchers can design more efficient and selective B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions, potentially leading to improved processes for olefin production.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex reaction network. This synergistic effect between surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contributes to the exceptional product distribution and high selectivity observed in B-based catalysts.

The surface of the catalyst, particularly the BOx sites, plays a crucial role in initiating the reaction by producing highly reactive radicals. These radicals are then released into the gas phase, where they participate in subsequent reactions. This mechanism allows for a higher concentration of active species in the reaction environment, promoting the overall efficiency of the process.

The interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions has significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. It suggests that an ideal catalyst should not only have optimized surface properties for radical formation but also facilitate the release of these radicals into the gas phase. This understanding can guide the development of more efficient catalysts by focusing on enhancing both aspects of the reaction mechanism.

Furthermore, this multidimensional mechanism sets B-based catalysts apart from traditional catalysts that rely solely on surface reactions, such as the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or adsorbed oxygen mechanism. This unique feature contributes to the superior performance of B-based catalysts in terms of selectivity and conversion.

In terms of catalyst design, this understanding suggests that efforts should be directed towards optimizing the surface properties to enhance radical formation while also considering the catalyst's ability to facilitate gas-phase reactions. This could involve tuning the concentration and distribution of BOx sites, as well as optimizing the catalyst's morphology to promote the release and interaction of radicals in the gas phase.

Overall, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts provides a more nuanced understanding of the reaction network, opening up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization to further improve performance in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
