[1] "Prior studies have reported that the exceptional product distribution on h-BN catalyst is ascribed to the combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals and subsequent gaseous reactions"

[2] "Given the BOx species were considered to be able to produce highly reactive radicals and release them to gas phase, the BOx sites formed on the BN surface may play a role in increasing the concentration of active species with the assistance of oxygen, e.g. propyl peroxide (C3H7OOH), which may be easily formed by rebound of peroxyl and propyl radicals and then released to the gas phase to react with propylene."

[3] "The unique synergistic activation of propane and ethane over BN was attributed to the mechanism with the co-presence and co-operation of surface-mediated radical formation processes and gas-phase channels, which was different from the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism of redox metal oxides and adsorbed oxygen mechanism of rare-earth oxide."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex reaction network. This synergistic effect between surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contributes to the exceptional product distribution and high selectivity observed in B-based catalysts.

The surface of the catalyst, particularly the BOx sites, plays a crucial role in initiating the reaction by producing highly reactive radicals. These radicals are then released into the gas phase, where they participate in subsequent reactions. This mechanism allows for a higher concentration of active species in the reaction environment, promoting the overall efficiency of the process.

The interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions has significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. It suggests that an ideal catalyst should not only have optimized surface properties for radical formation but also facilitate the release of these radicals into the gas phase. This understanding can guide the development of more efficient catalysts by focusing on enhancing both aspects of the reaction mechanism.

Furthermore, this multidimensional mechanism sets B-based catalysts apart from traditional catalysts that rely solely on surface reactions, such as the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or adsorbed oxygen mechanism. This unique feature contributes to the superior performance of B-based catalysts in terms of selectivity and conversion.

In terms of catalyst design, this understanding suggests that efforts should be directed towards optimizing the surface properties to enhance radical formation while also considering the catalyst's ability to facilitate gas-phase reactions. This could involve tuning the concentration and distribution of BOx sites, as well as optimizing the catalyst's morphology to promote the release and interaction of radicals in the gas phase.

Overall, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts provides a more nuanced understanding of the reaction network, opening up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization to further improve performance in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

ODHP反应机理在B基催化剂上的多维性本质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，为复杂的反应网络提供了全面的理解。表面介导和气相反应之间的协同效应有助于解释B基催化剂中观察到的特殊产物分布和高选择性。

催化剂表面，特别是BOx位点，在通过产生高活性自由基来启动反应中起着关键作用。这些自由基随后释放到气相中，参与后续反应。这种机制允许反应环境中存在更高浓度的活性物种，提高了整个过程的效率。

表面和气相反应之间的相互作用对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响。这表明理想的催化剂不仅应该具有优化的表面特性以形成自由基，还应该促进这些自由基释放到气相中。这种理解可以指导开发更高效的催化剂，重点关注增强反应机理的这两个方面。

此外，这种多维机制使B基催化剂与仅依赖表面反应的传统催化剂（如Mars-van Krevelen机制或吸附氧机制）不同。这一独特特征有助于B基催化剂在选择性和转化率方面的优越性能。

在催化剂设计方面，这种理解表明，应该致力于优化表面特性以增强自由基的形成，同时也要考虑催化剂促进气相反应的能力。这可能涉及调整BOx位点的浓度和分布，以及优化催化剂的形态以促进自由基在气相中的释放和相互作用。

总的来说，ODHP反应机理在B基催化剂上的多维性本质为反应网络提供了更细致的理解，为催化剂设计和优化开辟了新途径，以进一步提高氧化脱氢过程的性能。
