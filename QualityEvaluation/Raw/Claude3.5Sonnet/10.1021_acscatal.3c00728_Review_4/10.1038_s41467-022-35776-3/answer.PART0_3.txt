[1] "Prior studies have reported that the exceptional product distribution on h-BN catalyst is ascribed to the combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals and subsequent gaseous reactions"

[2] "Herein, we demonstrated that, during the ODH reaction catalyzed by h-BN, the in-situ formed olefins, which were generally considered chemically inert in boron-based catalytic systems, played a crucial role in promoting parent alkane conversion and cracking of C-C bonds."

[3] "These outcomes demonstrated that the in-situ formed olefins were the most likely products to enhance the oxidation of alkane."

[4] "Given this, here we put forward a hypothesis that PO was an intermediate product formed by the interaction of propane and propylene in the ODH reaction of propane catalyzed by BN."

[5] "The unique synergistic activation of propane and ethane over BN was attributed to the mechanism with the co-presence and co-operation of surface-mediated radical formation processes and gas-phase channels, which was different from the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism of redox metal oxides and adsorbed oxygen mechanism of rare-earth oxide."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex reaction network. This synergy between surface-mediated radical formation and subsequent gas-phase reactions contributes to the exceptional product distribution observed with h-BN catalysts.

The research reveals that in-situ formed olefins, previously thought to be chemically inert, play a crucial role in promoting parent alkane conversion and C-C bond cracking. This finding expands our understanding of the reaction pathways and highlights the importance of considering both surface and gas-phase interactions in the overall reaction mechanism.

The study also proposes that propylene oxide (PO) acts as an intermediate product formed by the interaction of propane and propylene in the ODH reaction. This insight further illustrates the complexity of the reaction network and the interplay between different species in the gas phase.

The unique synergistic activation of alkanes over BN catalysts is attributed to the co-presence and co-operation of surface-mediated radical formation processes and gas-phase channels. This mechanism differs from traditional catalytic systems, such as the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism of redox metal oxides or the adsorbed oxygen mechanism of rare-earth oxides.

The implications of these synergistic effects for catalyst performance and design optimization are significant. Understanding the multidimensional nature of the reaction mechanism allows for more targeted catalyst design, potentially leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in ODHP reactions. By considering both surface and gas-phase interactions, researchers can develop strategies to enhance desired reaction pathways while suppressing unwanted side reactions.

Furthermore, this comprehensive understanding of the reaction network opens up possibilities for innovative approaches in catalyst development, such as designing catalysts that can effectively promote beneficial gas-phase interactions or tailoring surface properties to optimize radical formation and subsequent reactions. This knowledge can guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP reactions, potentially leading to improved industrial processes for olefin production.

BN催化剂上烷烃的独特协同活化归因于表面介导的自由基形成过程和气相通道的共存和协同作用。这种机制不同于传统的催化系统，如氧化还原金属氧化物的Mars-van Krevelen机制或稀土氧化物的吸附氧机制。

这些协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响是显著的。理解反应机理的多维性质允许更有针对性的催化剂设计，可能导致ODHP反应中选择性和效率的提高。通过考虑表面和气相相互作用，研究人员可以制定策略来增强所需的反应途径，同时抑制不需要的副反应。

此外，对反应网络的全面理解为催化剂开发中的创新方法开辟了可能性，例如设计能有效促进有益气相相互作用的催化剂，或定制表面性质以优化自由基形成和随后的反应。这些知识可以指导开发更高效和选择性的ODHP反应催化剂，可能导致改进的工业烯烃生产工艺。
