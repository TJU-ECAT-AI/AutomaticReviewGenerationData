Selective oxidation of methane to CO on Ni@BOx via reaction-induced vapor migration of boron-containing species onto Ni
Highlights
•
Classical SMSI state (Ni@BOx) is observed in Ni particles mixed physically with pBN during methane oxidation at 600 .
•
The classical SMSI state switches the methane oxidation selectivity from CO2 to CO.
•
High reaction temperature and water drive the vapor migration of B(OH)x species from pBN onto Ni leading to the SMSI state.
Abstract
Dynamic migration of support-derived species and subsequent encapsulation of supported metal nanoparticles (NPs) are the well-known features of the Strong Metal-Support Interaction (SMSI) effect. Here, we report occurrence of the classical SMSI state in physical mixture of Ni NPs and porous hexagonal boron nitride powder (NipBN) during methane oxidation reaction at 600 , in which Ni NPs are encapsulated by BOx overlayers derived from the pBN component. The SMSI state can switch the methane oxidation selectivity from CO2 on the fresh NipBN catalyst to CO on the used catalyst. The encapsulation of Ni NPs by BOx overlayers has also been observed in Ni/Al2O3 catalyst which is physically mixed with pBN. Comprehensive characterizations confirm that the SMSI state is induced by vapor migration of boron-containing species e.g. BOxHy from pBN to metal surfaces, in which both high reaction temperature and water product play an important role.

1. Introduction
Methane is the main component of natural gas and a major greenhouse gas
[1]
,
[2]
. The catalytic combustion of methane to carbon dioxide and partial oxidation of methane to syngas are the effective ways to reduce the greenhouse effect caused by methane
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
. Ni presents comparable activity to noble metals for catalytic oxidation of methane, while thermal stability and coking resistance of Ni-based catalysts still hinder their applications. The previous works have demonstrated that the Ni-catalyzed performance in the catalytic oxidation of methane can be significantly improved by utilizing the interaction of Ni catalysts with suitable supports such as CeO2, ZnO, and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)

[11]
. However, the evolution of the interfacial structure of both metal and support during the reaction needs to be further explored, which is also an important research direction for the Strong Metal-Support Interaction (SMSI) effect
[12]

.
The migration of support-derived species onto the surface of metal nanoparticles (NPs) to form an ultrathin overlayer is the typical characteristic of the SMSI effect, which has been widely observed on group VIII metals supported on transition metal oxides (TiO2, Fe3O4, CeO2, etc.) upon high-temperature reduction treatments

[26]
. Generally, the encapsulation structure can block the metal active sites, which can inhibit the catalytic activity of metals
[27]
,
[28]
. However, in some cases the resulting encapsulated overlayers can be used to modify the catalytic performance in various metal-catalyzed reactions, which has been utilized to improve catalyst stability and alter product selectivity
[11]

[33]
. Tang et al. found that the stability of Au/TiO2 catalysts in CO oxidation and hydrocarbon combustion reactions has been greatly improved by constructing the classical SMSI state at high temperature reducing atmospheres
[28]
. Xin et al. constructed a Ru@MoO3x encapsulation structure during CO2 hydrogenation reaction, which switches the selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation from 100 % CH4 on fresh Ru particles to above 99.0 % CO at the SMSI state
[33]
.
The classical SMSI effect has been recently extended to some unconventional catalyst systems such as Au/ZnO, Ni/h-BN and Au/MgO
[11]

[39]
. In these cases, the encapsulation structure has been produced under oxidation or other specific reaction conditions. For example, Liu et al. reported that Au NPs supported on ZnO nanorods could be encapsulated by zinc oxide (ZnOx) overlayers under oxidation conditions at mild temperatures, in which the formation of Au-O-Zn bonds plays a key role in ZnOx migration onto the surface of Au NPs
[34]
. Dong et al. observed Ni-aided oxidative etching of h-BN nanosheets in dry reforming of methane (DRM) reaction and then migration of boron oxide (BOx) species onto the Ni NPs forming ultrathin BOx encapsulation overlayers
[11]
. Upon the formation of the SMSI state in these systems, the metal NPs are in close contact with the supports and thus support-derived species are supposed to migrate along the metal nanoparticle surface to form the ultrathin encapsulation overlayers
[21]
,
[23]
. Recently, it has been reported that the SMSI effect can also occur over metal catalysts which are physically mixed with oxides. For example, ZnOx species were found to migrate from ZnO particles onto Cu particles upon reduction treatment of physical mixture of ZnO and Cu powders in H2
[40]
. Zhang et al. have observed migration of TiOx onto the surface of large Ni particles, which are physically mixed with anatase TiO2 particles, and formation of an amorphous TiOx overlayer on the large Ni particles after treatment in H2 and at 300 C
[41]
. Therefore, the transport of active species from oxide support via direct vapor migration and subsequent deposition onto the metal surface may be active for the SMSI state, which yet needs to be corroborated by solid researches.
In this work, physical mixtures of Ni NPs and porous h-BN support (NipBN) were used in methane oxidation reaction. The classical SMSI state is formed in the NipBN catalyst during the methane oxidation where the selectivity can be reversed from CO2 to CO at 600  due to encapsulation of Ni NPs by BOx overlayers derived from the pBN support (Ni@BOxpBN). Adding pBN as a diluent to Al2O3 supported Ni catalyst (Ni/Al2O3pBN) further reduces the contact area between Ni NPs and pBN, while the SMSI effect can still occur under the same reaction condition. Based on ex-situ and in-situ characterizations, it has been revealed that both high reaction temperature and generated water product are indispensable for the formation and vapor migration of BOx or B(OH)x species from pBN onto Ni NPs. The reaction induced vapor migration of support-derived species onto the metal surface observed in this work suggests a new path for the SMSI state.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.1.1. Synthesis of porous h-BN (pBN)
Melamine (C3N6H6, Sinopharm Chemical reagent Co., Ltd) and boric acid (H3BO3, Sinopharm Chemical reagent Co., Ltd) were used as a nitrogen source and a boron source, respectively. In a typical process
[42]
,
[43]
, 5.0 g boric acid powder was dissolved in 200 mL deionized water at 60 C, and then 20.4 g melamine powder was added into the solution and further stirred and heated at 90  until all the water was evaporated. The obtained white solid was ground into powder and annealed at 1000 C under pure NH3 for 4 h. The obtained white solid was denoted as pBN.
2.1.2. Synthesis of NipBN
The NipBN catalyst was prepared through a physical mixing method. 48 mg commercial nickel oxide powder (Aladdin) and 300 mg pBN powder were ground in an agate mortar for 10 min, and then pretreated in pure H2 for 1 h at 500  (denoted as NipBN).
2.1.3. Synthesis of NiAl2O3
The NiAl2O3 catalyst was prepared through a physical mixing method. 48 mg commercial nickel oxide powder (Aladdin) and 300 mg commercial Al2O3 powder (Alfa) were ground in an agate mortar for 10 min, and then pretreated in pure H2 for 1 h at 500  (denoted as NiAl2O3).
2.1.4. Synthesis of Ni/Al2O3
The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by an impregnation method. Typically, 0.94 g nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Sinopharm Chemical reagent Co., Ltd) was added to 20 mL ethanol. 1.0 g commercial Al2O3 powder was impregnated with the Ni(NO3)2 ethanol solution. The suspension was sonicated for 30 min, and further stirred and heated at 40  until all ethanol was evaporated. The residual solid was dried overnight at 110 . The resulting solid powder was further treated in pure H2 at 500  for 2 h, and the obtained sample was named as Ni/Al2O3.
2.1.5. Synthesis of Ni/Al2O3pBN
Ni/Al2O3pBN catalyst was prepared by a physical mixing method. 30 mg pBN powder was added as a diluent to the 60 mg Ni/Al2O3 powder, and then they were mixed by shaking in a reaction tube for 1 min (denoted as Ni/Al2O3pBN).
2.1.6. Synthesis of Al2O3pBN
Al2O3pBN catalyst was prepared by a physical mixing method. 30 mg pBN powder was added as a diluent to the 60 mg Al2O3 powder, and then they were mixed by shaking in a reaction tube for 1 min (denoted as Al2O3pBN).
2.2. Catalyst characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on an Empyrean diffractometer using a Cu kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation source and scanning rate of 15 /min. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on Hitachi HT 7700 microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEM-F200 and TECNAI G2 F30 microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 and 300 kV, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired by JSM7900F microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images were obtained using the JEM-F200 and JSM7900F microscopes. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopic (DRIFTS) spectra were acquired on a Bruker vertex 80 v spectrometer equipped with a Mercury-Cadmium-Tellurium (MCT) detector and a HARRICK heat chamber DiffusIR accessory. The DRIFT spectra were obtained in the range of 4000400 cm1 with a resolution of 4 cm1 and 32 scans. Before collecting CO adsorption signals, each sample was pretreated in pure H2 at 500 C for 1 h and cooled down to room temperature in flowing Ar. CO was introduced into the cell and then spectra were collected until the signals were stable. Ar flow was switched to purge the gaseous and weakly adsorbed CO till that the spectra were unchanged. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out with a SPECS spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα x-ray source operated at 300 W.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Methane oxidation reaction was evaluated in a home-built fixed bed microreactor. The products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent GC6890) equipped with a TDX-1 column and a thermal conductivity detector. 60 mg catalysts were loaded into a quartz tube, and the reaction gas consists of 0.5 % CH4, 2 % O2 and He balance. Before reaction, all catalysts were pretreated in flowing pure H2 at 500  for 1 h. The catalytic reaction was evaluated at 600 C, and the conversions of CH4 (C(CH4)) and selectivity of CO2 and CO (S(CO2), S(CO)) were calculated as follows:
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performance
The methane oxidation reaction data on the NipBN catalyst containing a physical mixture of Ni NPs and pBN are presented in
Fig. 1
a. CH4 conversion increases from 42 % to 88 % at 600 within 1h, and then gradually decreases to 40 % after 20h test. Meanwhile, the product selectivity changes from 100 % CO2 to 80 % CO after 5h test, and then the CO selectivity remains unchanged with the further increase of the reaction time. The reaction results show that the complete oxidation of methane to CO2 occurs first, which is well expected on Ni-based catalysts
[44]
,
[45]
. In contrast, the partial oxidation of methane to CO occurs with the on-going reaction process, which has not been observed. For comparison, NiAl2O3 catalyst containing a physical mixture of Ni NPs and Al2O3 has been tested under the identical reaction conditions. As shown in
Fig. 1
b, CH4 conversion increases from 72 % to 88 % at 600 within 1h and then drops to 49 % after 20h test. During the 20h test only CO2 is observed on the NiAl2O3 catalyst, which is in sharp contrast with the reaction behavior from the NipBN catalyst.

3.2. Structural properties of catalysts
The changes in the product selectivity suggest the evolution of surface structure of NipBN catalyst during the methane oxidation reaction. XRD patterns of the fresh and spent NipBN catalysts are presented in
Fig. 2
a. Strong diffraction peaks for metallic Ni at 44.5 and 51.8 are observed in the fresh NipBN catalyst
[8]
. In contrast, the spent NipBN catalyst (after 20h test at 600) shows three strong diffraction peaks at 37.2, 43.2 and 62.8 corresponding to NiO (111), (200) and (220), respectively. The disappearance of diffraction peaks of metallic Ni indicates that Ni NPs are oxidized after the methane oxidation reaction. XRD pattern of the fresh NiAl2O3 catalyst (
Fig. 2
b) also shows the diffraction peaks for metallic Ni at 44.5 and 51.8, and only the diffraction peaks of NiO appear in the spent NiAl2O3 catalyst, indicating that the Ni NPs of the fresh NiAl2O3 catalyst are also oxidized after the reaction.

(d) HRTEM and (e-h) EDS mapping images of the spent NipBN catalyst. Inset image of (c) and (d) show NiO (200) and NiO (111) lattice spacing, respectively. For the electron microscopy analysis, each sample was pretreated with air at 300C for 2h in order to exclude the influence of surface contaminating carbon overlayers.
The fresh and spent NipBN catalysts (
Fig. S1a
-b) are further characterized by TEM, which shows that the Ni NPs are in contact with the pBN surface, and the average size of Ni NPs is in the range of 48.7nm (fresh) to 29.5nm (spent). For the fresh and spent NiAl2O3 catalysts, the average size of Ni NPs is in the range of 40.2nm (fresh) to 30.3nm (spent) (
Fig. S2a
-b). HRTEM images (
Fig. 2
c,
S3
) show that Ni NPs in the fresh NipBN catalyst have bare and clean surfaces. In contrast, Ni NPs in the spent NipBN catalyst are covered by amorphous overlayers (
Fig. 2
d,
S4a-b
). EDS elemental mapping analysis (
Fig. 2
e-h) has been further conducted and turns out that the amorphous overlayers consist of B and O elements. Thus, we conclude that the Ni NPs are encapsulated by amorphous BOx overlayers which happens during the methane oxidation reaction. It should be noted that Ni NPs in both fresh and used NiAl2O3 catalysts present well-defined surface structures without amorphous overlayers (
Figs. S56)
.
The encapsulation of metal NPs with support-derived material overlayers is a typical characteristic of the SMSI effect in oxide supported metal catalysts
[12]
. The classical SMSI state usually results in the suppression of surface adsorption of small molecules such as CO and H2
[12]
,
[27]
, which can be well confirmed by the surface adsorption experiments. DRIFTS experiments of CO adsorption were performed over the fresh and spent NipBN catalysts. As shown in
Fig. 3
a, two adsorption peaks on the fresh NipBN catalyst centered at 2052 and 1894cm1 are observed, both of which can be ascribed to linear and bridge CO adsorbed on metallic Ni (Ni0), respectively
[46]
. Besides, the bands at 2171 and 2116cm1 originate from gaseous CO molecules, which disappear completely upon purging with Ar (
Fig. S7
). For the spent NipBN catalyst, the peak intensity of linear CO adsorption on Ni0 at 2052cm1 is significantly reduced, indicating that Ni NPs are encapsulated, which is consistent with the HRTEM result. On the contrary, the linear CO adsorption on Ni0 centered at 2057cm1 is observed over the fresh NiAlAl2O3 catalyst, which has no big change in the peak position and intensity after the reaction (
Fig. 3
b). XPS spectra in
Fig. 3
c demonstrate the difference in the chemical states of the fresh and spent NipBN catalysts. Two kinds of boron species are corresponding to h-BN (190.3eV) and BOx (192.2eV) species in both NipBN catalysts
[47]
,
[48]
. The BOx percentage increases from 39 % to 55 % after the reaction. Two components at 853.6 and 857.6eV in the XPS Ni 2p3/2 spectrum of the fresh sample (
Fig. 3
d) are attributed to NiO and Ni2O3 species, respectively, which are due to the surface oxidation when exposed to air
[49]
. For the spent NipBN catalyst, the shoulder peak at 863.8eV (satellite peak) indicates the presence of more than one nickeloxygen species on the catalyst surface after the reaction at 600
[50]
. The increase in Ni 2p3/2 peak intensity of the spent NipBN catalyst may be due to the decrease in Ni particle size after the reaction.

3.3. Evolution of the catalyst structure
The above results suggest that the methane oxidation reaction has induced a significant structural change of the NipBN catalyst from bare Ni NPs to Ni NPs encapsulated with BOx overlayers. The formation of an encapsulation structure of Ni@BOx leads to the change in product selectivity from 100 % CO2 to 80 % CO. This process has been illustrated in
Fig. 3
e. In the initial stage of the reaction, the activation of CH4 and O2 occurs on the surface of bare Ni NPs. CO2 and H2O are generated via combustion of methane. At the same time, more BOx species (
Fig. 3
c) are formed with the methane oxidation reaction. The produced BOx species may gradually migrate onto Ni NPs to form BOx encapsulation overlayers. Consequently, the reaction will mainly take place on the surface of BOx overlayers, in which molecular O2 bonded to surface coordinatively unsaturated BO3 centers acts as a judicious oxidant for methane activation with mitigated CO2 formation
[51]
.
In order to observe the formation of the SMSI state between Ni NPs and pBN more clearly, it is necessary to slow down the formation process. Therefore, reducing the contact area between Ni NPs and pBN has been further attempted. Here, pBN was added as a diluent to a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, which were mixed by shaking them in a reaction tube (denoted as Ni/Al2O3pBN,
Fig. 4
a). SEM and EDS mapping images (
Fig. S8
) show that Ni NPs of Ni/Al2O3 and pBN are distributed in the Ni/Al2O3pBN catalyst without direct contact. This catalyst is treated under the same reaction conditions as applied before for the NipBN catalyst. Interestingly, changes in product selectivity from CO2 to CO can still be observed during the reaction over the Ni/Al2O3pBN catalyst (
Fig. 4
b). Within 6h of the reaction at 600 the product is 100 % CO2. After 6h the selectivity of CO gradually increases and finally gets stabilized at 75 %, while CH4 conversion decreases from 100 % to 59 % after 42h test. For comparison, Ni/Al2O3, pure Al2O3 and pBN catalysts have also been tested under the same reaction conditions. For the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (
Fig. 4
c), only CO2 is observed and CH4 conversion decreases from 100 % to 72 % after 42h test. Pure Al2O3 has quite low methane oxidation activity (
Fig. S9
). CH4 conversion decreases from 93 % to 3 % over the pure pBN catalyst with 72 % CO selectivity after 42h test (
Fig. 4
d), suggesting that strong deactivation happens in the pBN-catalyzed process. These results confirm that the addition of pBN plays a key role in the modulation of product selectivity from CO2 to CO during Ni-catalyzed methane oxidation at 600.

SEM and Elemental mapping images (
Fig. 5
a-e, S10) of the spent Ni/Al2O3pBN catalyst display that Ni NPs are still located on Al2O3 without direct contact with pBN. HRTEM images of the fresh Ni/Al2O3pBN catalyst show clean Ni particle surface (
Fig. S11
). After the reaction, the surface of Ni NPs supported on Al2O3 is covered by an amorphous overlayer (
Fig. 5
f,
S12
). Elemental mapping analysis (
Fig. 5
g-j,
S13
) of the spent Ni/Al2O3pBN catalyst confirms that the overlayer has B and O components, indicating the migration of BOx species from pBN to the surface of Ni NPs on Al2O3 to form an encapsulation overlayer. It should be noted that B signals can be observed in the alumina supports, indicating that the support surfaces may be also covered by B-containing species.

DRIFTS spectra of CO adsorption (

XPS B 1s spectra of the fresh and spent Ni/Al2O3pBN catalysts are shown in
Fig. 6
b, indicating that the proportion of surface BOx species gradually increases with the increasing reaction time. The surface chemistry studies further confirm that the methane oxidation atmosphere indeed induces encapsulation of Ni NPs by BOx species in the Ni/Al2O3pBN catalyst.

3.4. Proposed formation mechanism for SMSI state (Ni@BOx)
We have observed the SMSI state (Ni@BOx) in the Ni/Al2O3pBN catalyst during the methane oxidation at 600, which alters the product selectivity of Ni-catalyzed methane oxidation. Ni NPs and pBN are distributed in the Ni/Al2O3pBN catalyst without direct contact and, therefore, the occurrence of the SMSI state strongly suggests the vapor migration of boron-containing species from pBN component to surfaces of Ni NPs. It is known that both BN and BOx species are very difficult to evaporate for direct gas phase migration
[52]
. Considering that the boron oxides can form volatile boric acid in the presence of high temperature water vapor
[53]
, we suggest that the SMSI between Ni NPs and pBN may be achieved by high temperature-induced vapor migration of B(OH)x species.
To prove this hypothesis, some confirmatory experiments have been carried out. The dehydrated commercial boron oxide powder was treated in 3 % H2O/Ar at 600 for 12h, and its mass was reduced by 9.2 % after the treatment. At the same time, boric acid was found to deposit onto the inner wall of the quartz tube at the exhaust end (
Fig. S14
), which proves that boron oxide can react with water vapor to generate volatile boric acid. As a comparison, pBN powder was first treated in O2 at 600 for 12h and its mass was increased by 5.4 % due to the oxidation of pBN into BOx. Then, the oxidized pBN powder was further treated in H2O/Ar at 600C for 20h and its mass was decreased by 12.2 %. Meanwhile, boric acid was also formed on the inner tube wall at the end of the quartz tube after the treatment (
Fig. S15
). The control experiments indicate that BOx species on the pBN surface can form volatile B(OH)x species in the presence of high temperature water vapor.
According to the above results, the formation of the SMSI state can be illustrated in
Fig. 6
c. In the initial stage of the reaction, the combustion reaction of methane preferentially occurs on Ni/Al2O3 to generate CO2 and water vapor. At the same time, the pBN surface is partially oxidized to generate a large amount of BOx species, which further react with the generated water vapor to produce volatile B(OH)x. As the reaction time increases, the volatile B(OH)x can gradually migrate onto the surface of Ni NPs supported on Al2O3 to form encapsulation overlayers, which continues to act as active sites to activate CH4 and O2
[51]
. Interestingly, the BOx overlayers migrated onto the Ni NPs of Ni/Al2O3pBN catalyst have better activity and stability than the BOx species on the pBN (
Fig. S16
) during the reaction at 600C (
Figs. 4
b, d and
S17
), which may indicate that Ni NPs also play a certain role in the reaction in addition to the function as a support to disperse and stabilize the BOx species. Here, given the lower melting point of boron oxide (around 450C), defects and pores may exist in the BOx overlayers, which allow the reactants to access the surface of Ni NPs. Therefore, Ni helps dissociate CH4 to generate CHx and H, and H adsorbs onto BOx species to form B-O-H active sites. Then, CHx reacts with B-O-H to generate CHxOH, which is further decomposed to CO and H2. So, Ni NPs may work synergistically with the BOx/B(OH)x species in the methane oxidation reaction

4. Conclusions
We have observed the occurrence of the classical SMSI state in both NipBN and Ni/Al2O3pBN catalysts in methane oxidation at 600, in which Ni NPs are only physically mixed with pBN. The BOx species from pBN can migrate onto Ni NPs to form the encapsulation structure (Ni@BOx) during the reaction, resulting in the switch of the reaction selectivity from CO2 (on the exposed Ni NPs) to CO (on the Ni@BOx NPs). Since Ni NPs are not in close contact with pBN or even with no direct contact with pBN in these catalysts, the formation of the BOx encapsulation overlayers indicates the vapor migration of boron-containing species from pBN to metal surfaces, in which both high reaction temperature and water product play an important role. Our study reveals a novel mechanism for the formation of encapsulation overlayers on metal nanoparticles under the SMSI state.
