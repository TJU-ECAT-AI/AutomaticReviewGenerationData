Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the multidimensional nature of the ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or its implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. The document primarily focuses on the selective oxidation of methane to CO on Ni@BOx catalysts via reaction-induced vapor migration of boron-containing species. It does not discuss ODHP reactions or their mechanisms.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有包含关于B基催化剂上ODHP(丙烷氧化脱氢)反应机理的多维性质或其对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响的任何信息。该文件主要关注通过反应诱导的含硼物种气相迁移在Ni@BOx催化剂上选择性氧化甲烷生成CO。它没有讨论ODHP反应或其机理。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about the multidimensional nature of the ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or its surface and gas-phase radical reactions. The document focuses on methane oxidation over Ni-based catalysts and the formation of strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) between Ni nanoparticles and boron-containing species. It does not discuss ODHP or the reaction network involving both surface and gas-phase reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

提供的文献中没有包含有关B基催化剂上ODHP(丙烷氧化脱氢)反应机理的多维性质或其表面和气相自由基反应的任何信息。该文档主要关注Ni基催化剂上的甲烷氧化以及Ni纳米颗粒与含硼物种之间的强金属-载体相互作用(SMSI)的形成。它没有讨论ODHP或涉及表面和气相反应的反应网络。因此，基于给定的文档无法回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The document does not contain any information about the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or its implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. The text focuses on the selective oxidation of methane to CO on Ni catalysts encapsulated by boron oxide overlayers. It does not discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) or surface and gas-phase radical reactions in that context.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

该文档不包含任何关于B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质或其对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响的信息。文本主要讨论了被氧化硼覆盖层包覆的Ni催化剂上甲烷选择性氧化生成CO的过程。它没有讨论丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODHP)或在这种背景下的表面和气相自由基反应。
