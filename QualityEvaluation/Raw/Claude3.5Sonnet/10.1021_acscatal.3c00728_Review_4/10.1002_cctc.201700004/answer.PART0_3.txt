<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not directly discuss the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or the synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase radical reactions. The document focuses primarily on the performance and characterization of edge-hydroxylated boron nitride as a catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, but does not go into detail about the broader reaction network or gas-phase reactions. Therefore, this specific question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information given in the document.

提供的文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质,也没有涉及表面反应和气相自由基反应的协同效应。该文档主要集中于边缘羟基化氮化硼作为丙烷氧化脱氢催化剂的性能和表征,但并未详细介绍更广泛的反应网络或气相反应。因此,仅基于文档中给出的信息,无法充分回答这个具体问题。
