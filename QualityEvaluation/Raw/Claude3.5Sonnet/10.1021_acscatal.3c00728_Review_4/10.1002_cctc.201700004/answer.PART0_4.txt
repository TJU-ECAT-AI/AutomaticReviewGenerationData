The provided literature does not contain information directly addressing the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or the synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase radical reactions. The text focuses primarily on edge-hydroxylated boron nitride as a metal-free catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, discussing its selectivity, stability, and characterization. It does not explore the broader implications of multidimensional reaction networks or synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions for B-based catalysts in general.

所提供的文献中并未直接涉及B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，或表面反应与气相自由基反应的协同效应。该文本主要集中讨论边缘羟基化的氮化硼作为无金属催化剂用于丙烷的氧化脱氢，包括其选择性、稳定性和表征。它没有探讨多维反应网络或表面反应与气相反应之间协同效应对B基催化剂的更广泛影响。
