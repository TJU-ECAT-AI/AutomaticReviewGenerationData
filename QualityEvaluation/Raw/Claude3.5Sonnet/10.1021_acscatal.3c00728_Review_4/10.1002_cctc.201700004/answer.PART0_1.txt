<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not directly address the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or discuss surface and gas-phase radical reactions. The document focuses primarily on the performance and characterization of edge-hydroxylated boron nitride as a catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, without delving into the detailed reaction network or synergistic effects between different types of reactions. Therefore, this specific question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，也未涉及表面和气相自由基反应。该文档主要集中于边缘羟基化氮化硼作为丙烷氧化脱氢催化剂的性能和表征，没有深入探讨详细的反应网络或不同类型反应之间的协同效应。因此，仅基于给定文献中提供的信息，无法充分回答这个具体问题。
