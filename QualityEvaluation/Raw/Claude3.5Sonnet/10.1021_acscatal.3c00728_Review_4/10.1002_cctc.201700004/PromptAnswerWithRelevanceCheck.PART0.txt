Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not directly address the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or discuss synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase radical reactions. The text focuses primarily on the performance and characterization of edge-hydroxylated boron nitride as a catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, but does not go into detail about the broader reaction network or gas-phase radical reactions. Therefore, this specific question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质,也没有探讨表面反应和气相自由基反应之间的协同效应。文本主要集中于边缘羟基化氮化硼作为丙烷氧化脱氢催化剂的性能和表征,但并未详细介绍更广泛的反应网络或气相自由基反应。因此,仅基于给定文献中提供的信息,无法充分回答这个具体问题。

The provided literature does not contain information directly addressing the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or the synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase radical reactions. The text focuses primarily on edge-hydroxylated boron nitride as a metal-free catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, discussing its selectivity, stability, and characterization. It does not explore the broader implications of multidimensional reaction networks or synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions for B-based catalysts in general.

所提供的文献中并未直接涉及B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，或表面反应与气相自由基反应的协同效应。该文本主要集中讨论边缘羟基化的氮化硼作为无金属催化剂用于丙烷的氧化脱氢，包括其选择性、稳定性和表征。它没有探讨多维反应网络或表面反应与气相反应之间协同效应对B基催化剂的更广泛影响。
