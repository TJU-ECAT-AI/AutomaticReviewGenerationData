1. The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism in B-based catalysts: Integrating surface and gas-phase radical reactions for a comprehensive understanding of catalytic performance and synergistic effects.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complex interplay between heterogeneous catalysis on the boron-based surface and homogeneous gas-phase chemistry contributes to the exceptional performance of these catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity.

Key aspects of the multidimensional mechanism include:

1. Surface Reactions:
   - BOx and BOH sites on the catalyst surface act as active sites for selective C-H bond activation [10.1016/j.jcat.2018.11.014].
   - These sites facilitate the formation of alkyl radicals, which are then released into the gas phase [10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330].
   - Oxygen activation occurs on the catalyst surface, forming selective oxidizing species [10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330].

2. Gas-Phase Reactions:
   - Alkyl radicals formed on the surface propagate and react in the gas phase [10.1002/anie.202003695].
   - Gas-phase reactions involve alkyl hydroperoxides and other radical species, contributing to olefin formation [10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330].
   - Direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals has been observed using SVUV-PIMS [10.1002/anie.202002440].

3. Synergistic Effects:
   - The combination of surface-mediated radical formation and gas-phase propagation explains the remarkable product distribution [10.1002/anie.202003695].
   - Surface reaction rates influence gas-phase free radical processes, and vice versa [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_4].
   - The effective coupling of surface and gas-phase reactions plays a crucial role in achieving high activity and selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_4].

4. Reaction Pathways:
   - Propene is mainly formed on the catalyst surface through C-H activation of propane [10.1002/anie.202002440].
   - C1 and C2 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways [10.1002/anie.202002440].
   - The reaction occurs not only on 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space of the gas phase [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_4].

5. Catalyst Structure and Performance:
   - The one-dimensional nature of edge sites in BN-based catalysts contributes to high olefin selectivity by stabilizing propyl radicals [10.1126/science.aaf7885].
   - Oxygen-terminated armchair edges (>BOON<) are identified as likely active sites for the ODHP reaction [10.1126/science.aaf7885].
   - The formation and distribution of BOH and BO sites on the catalyst surface are crucial for performance [10.1002/cctc.201700725].

Implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Selective Site Engineering: Design catalysts with optimized distribution of BOx and BOH sites to balance surface activation and gas-phase reactions [10.1016/j.jcat.2018.11.014].

2. Edge Site Optimization: Focus on creating and exposing more edge sites in BN-based catalysts to enhance selectivity [10.1126/science.aaf7885].

3. Radical Management: Develop strategies to control the formation and propagation of radicals in both surface and gas phases [10.1002/anie.202003695].

4. Oxygen Activation Control: Optimize oxygen activation on the catalyst surface to maintain high selectivity while avoiding over-oxidation [10.1002/cctc.201700725].

5. Reactor Design: Consider both surface catalysis and gas-phase reactions when designing reactors, optimizing factors such as temperature, pressure, and residence time [10.1002/anie.202002440].

6. Kinetic Modeling: Develop comprehensive kinetic models that incorporate both surface and gas-phase reactions for more accurate performance prediction [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_4].

7. In-situ Characterization: Employ advanced in-situ spectroscopic techniques to better understand the dynamic interplay between surface and gas-phase species during the reaction [10.1002/anie.202002440].
