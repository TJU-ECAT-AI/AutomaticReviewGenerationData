[1] "Our operando infrared spectroscopy and 18O isotope tracer study explicitly demonstrates that BO(H) active sites are formed at the edges of BN through the aid of ethane, and the dehydrogenation circle is completed over these BO sites by the assistance of O2."

[2] "Altogether, we were able to draw two possible catalytic pathways, as determined by the bond-breaking position of ethane (Scheme1). Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

[3] "At high reaction temperatures (X >10%, nonkinetic measuring region), the formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2, which is capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from ethane to form C2H4 and H2O, cannot be ruled out."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The study reveals that the reaction proceeds through different pathways depending on temperature and conversion rates.

At low temperatures and conversions, ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites at the edges of BN, which then facilitate direct dehydrogenation of ethane with the help of adsorbed O2. This process produces ethylene and H2 without combustion products.

At higher temperatures and conversions, BO active sites form from adsorbed O2, which can abstract hydrogen from ethane to produce ethylene and water. This pathway involves more aggressive oxidation and can lead to some combustion products.

The synergistic effects of surface reactions (formation of BO(H) sites) and gas-phase reactions (interaction of ethane with these sites) have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Catalyst edge sites are crucial for activity, suggesting that increasing edge exposure could improve performance.

2. The formation of BO(H) sites requires both ethane and oxygen, indicating the importance of managing reactant ratios.

3. Temperature control is critical, as it determines which pathway dominates and affects selectivity.

4. Catalyst design should focus on promoting BOH site formation while minimizing BO site formation to maintain high selectivity at higher conversions.

5. Understanding the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions can guide the development of catalysts that balance activity and selectivity across a wider range of conditions.

These insights can inform strategies for catalyst synthesis, reactor design, and process optimization to achieve higher yields of ethylene while minimizing unwanted side products.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，为我们理解整个反应网络做出了重要贡献。研究表明，反应通过不同的途径进行，取决于温度和转化率。

在低温和低转化率条件下，乙烷促进BN边缘BOH活性位点的形成，这些位点在吸附O2的帮助下促进乙烷的直接脱氢。这个过程产生乙烯和H2，不产生燃烧产物。

在高温和高转化率条件下，BO活性位点从吸附的O2形成，可以从乙烷中提取氢原子生成乙烯和水。这种途径涉及更激进的氧化，可能导致一些燃烧产物。

表面反应（BO(H)位点的形成）和气相反应（乙烷与这些位点的相互作用）的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 催化剂边缘位点对活性至关重要，表明增加边缘暴露可能提高性能。

2. BO(H)位点的形成需要乙烷和氧气，说明管理反应物比例的重要性。

3. 温度控制至关重要，因为它决定了哪种途径占主导地位并影响选择性。

4. 催化剂设计应着重于促进BOH位点形成，同时最小化BO位点形成，以在更高转化率下保持高选择性。

5. 理解表面和气相反应之间的相互作用可以指导开发在更广泛条件下平衡活性和选择性的催化剂。

这些见解可以为催化剂合成、反应器设计和过程优化提供策略，以实现更高的乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副产品。
