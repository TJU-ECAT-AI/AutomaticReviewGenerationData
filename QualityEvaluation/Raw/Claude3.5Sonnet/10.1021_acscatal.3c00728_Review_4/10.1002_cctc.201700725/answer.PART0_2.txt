[1] "Herein, our oxidation stability test of BN materials also showed that BN materials could not be oxidized below 800C under an O2 atmosphere (see FigureS1 in the Supporting Information), which indicated that with molecular O2 alone it was difficult to form the proposed BO species at the armchair edges under ODH reaction conditions (<600C)."

[2] "We therefore anticipated that O2 activation should be initiated by CH activation. Indeed, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane;"

[3] "Altogether, we were able to draw two possible catalytic pathways, as determined by the bond-breaking position of ethane (Scheme1). Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

[4] "At high reaction temperatures (X >10%, nonkinetic measuring region), the formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2, which is capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from ethane to form C2H4 and H2O, cannot be ruled out."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. The study reveals that the reaction mechanism is not straightforward but involves multiple steps and pathways depending on the reaction conditions.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Temperature-dependent pathways: At lower temperatures, ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, leading to direct dehydrogenation with adsorbed O2. At higher temperatures, BO active sites form from adsorbed O2, capable of abstracting hydrogen from ethane.

2. O2 activation mechanism: Molecular O2 alone cannot form BO species at armchair edges under typical ODH conditions. Instead, O2 activation is initiated by CH activation, highlighting the importance of the interplay between the reactants.

3. Active site formation: The BO(H) sites, crucial for the ODH reaction, are formed through an induction phase involving C2H6 activation. This suggests that the catalyst's active sites are not pre-existing but form during the reaction.

4. Selectivity control: The multidimensional nature of the reaction allows for high selectivity towards ethylene by preventing the formation of dissociative oxygen species (DOS) that lead to overoxidation.

These insights suggest that catalyst design should focus on optimizing the formation and stability of BO(H) active sites, controlling the O2 activation process, and maintaining the delicate balance between surface and gas-phase reactions to achieve high selectivity and conversion. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent reaction pathways indicate that precise temperature control is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance.

基于B的催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维特性，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，显著增进了我们对整体反应网络的理解。研究表明，反应机理并不简单，而是根据反应条件涉及多个步骤和途径。

表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 温度依赖的反应途径：在较低温度下，乙烷促进BOH活性位点的形成，导致与吸附O2直接脱氢。在较高温度下，BO活性位点从吸附O2形成，能够从乙烷中提取氢。

2. O2活化机制：在典型ODH条件下，单独的分子O2无法在扶手椅边缘形成BO物种。相反，O2活化由CH活化引发，突显了反应物之间相互作用的重要性。

3. 活性位点形成：对ODH反应至关重要的BO(H)位点是通过涉及C2H6活化的诱导阶段形成的。这表明催化剂的活性位点不是预先存在的，而是在反应过程中形成的。

4. 选择性控制：反应的多维特性通过防止形成导致过度氧化的解离氧物种（DOS），实现了对乙烯的高选择性。

这些见解表明，催化剂设计应该着重于优化BO(H)活性位点的形成和稳定性，控制O2活化过程，并保持表面和气相反应之间的微妙平衡，以实现高选择性和转化率。此外，温度依赖的反应途径表明，精确的温度控制对于优化催化剂性能至关重要。
