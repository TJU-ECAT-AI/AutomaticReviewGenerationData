[1] "Herein, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane; as such, unprecedented selectivity for ethylene without CO2 formation under the weak oxidation conditions was found."

[2] "Altogether, we were able to draw two possible catalytic pathways, as determined by the bond-breaking position of ethane (Scheme1). Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

[3] "At high reaction temperatures (X >10%, nonkinetic measuring region), the formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2, which is capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from ethane to form C2H4 and H2O, cannot be ruled out."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase reactions, contributing to a complex overall reaction network. The literature reveals that the reaction proceeds through different pathways depending on temperature and conversion levels.

At low temperatures and conversions (<10%), the mechanism primarily involves surface reactions. Ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites on the catalyst surface, which then facilitate direct dehydrogenation of ethane with the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2. This pathway results in high selectivity towards ethylene without CO2 formation.

At higher temperatures and conversions (>10%), the reaction mechanism becomes more complex, potentially involving both surface and gas-phase reactions. The formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2 becomes more prominent, capable of abstracting hydrogen atoms from ethane to form ethylene and water. This shift in mechanism suggests an interplay between surface-catalyzed reactions and possible gas-phase radical processes.

The synergistic effects of these multidimensional reaction pathways have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Temperature control: Careful temperature management is crucial to balance selectivity and conversion, as different mechanisms dominate at different temperature ranges.

2. Active site engineering: Catalyst design should focus on optimizing the distribution and nature of BOH and BO sites to enhance performance across various reaction conditions.

3. Oxygen management: The role of adsorbed O2 in both pathways highlights the importance of controlling oxygen concentration and activation to maintain high selectivity.

4. Conversion level considerations: Catalyst design must account for changes in reaction mechanism as conversion levels increase, potentially incorporating strategies to mitigate the shift towards less selective pathways at higher conversions.

5. Radical chemistry: Understanding and controlling potential gas-phase radical reactions at higher temperatures may be key to maintaining selectivity and preventing unwanted side reactions.

By considering these multidimensional aspects, researchers can develop more effective catalysts and reaction conditions for the ODHP process, potentially leading to improved yields and selectivities in industrial applications.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性涉及表面和气相反应，构成了一个复杂的整体反应网络。文献显示，反应通过不同的途径进行，取决于温度和转化水平。

在低温和低转化率（<10%）条件下，机理主要涉及表面反应。乙烷促进催化剂表面BOH活性位点的形成，这些位点在吸附O2的辅助下促进乙烷的直接脱氢，生成乙烯和H2。这种途径导致了高的乙烯选择性，且不产生CO2。

在较高温度和转化率（>10%）下，反应机理变得更加复杂，可能同时涉及表面和气相反应。从吸附O2形成的BO活性位点变得更加显著，能够从乙烷中提取氢原子形成乙烯和水。这种机理的转变表明了表面催化反应和可能的气相自由基过程之间的相互作用。

这些多维反应途径的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 温度控制：仔细管理温度对平衡选择性和转化率至关重要，因为不同的机理在不同的温度范围内占主导地位。

2. 活性位点工程：催化剂设计应集中于优化BOH和BO位点的分布和性质，以在各种反应条件下提高性能。

3. 氧气管理：吸附O2在两种途径中的作用突显了控制氧气浓度和活化以保持高选择性的重要性。

4. 转化水平考虑：催化剂设计必须考虑随着转化水平增加而发生的反应机理变化，可能需要纳入策略来缓解高转化率下向较低选择性途径的转变。

5. 自由基化学：理解和控制高温下潜在的气相自由基反应可能是维持选择性和防止不必要副反应的关键。

通过考虑这些多维方面，研究人员可以为ODHP过程开发更有效的催化剂和反应条件，可能导致工业应用中产率和选择性的提高。
