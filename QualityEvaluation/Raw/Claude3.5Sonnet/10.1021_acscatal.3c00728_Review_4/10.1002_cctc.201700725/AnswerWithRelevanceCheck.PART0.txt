          "Our operando infrared spectroscopy and 18O isotope tracer study explicitly demonstrates that BO(H) active sites are formed at the edges of BN through the aid of ethane, and the dehydrogenation circle is completed over these BO sites by the assistance of O2."

"Altogether, we were able to draw two possible catalytic pathways, as determined by the bond-breaking position of ethane (Scheme1). Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

"At high reaction temperatures (X >10%, nonkinetic measuring region), the formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2, which is capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from ethane to form C2H4 and H2O, cannot be ruled out."

"Herein, our oxidation stability test of BN materials also showed that BN materials could not be oxidized below 800C under an O2 atmosphere (see FigureS1 in the Supporting Information), which indicated that with molecular O2 alone it was difficult to form the proposed BO species at the armchair edges under ODH reaction conditions (<600C)."

"We therefore anticipated that O2 activation should be initiated by CH activation. Indeed, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane;"

"It can therefore be proposed that the presence of ethane promotes the activation of adsorbed O2 towards the edges of BN and the formation of BO(H) sites, and the dehydrogenation circle is finally completed over the BO sites."

          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The study reveals two main pathways depending on temperature and conversion rates:

1. Low-temperature pathway (&lt;10% conversion):
   - Ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites at the edges of BN.
   - These BOH sites facilitate direct dehydrogenation of ethane with adsorbed O2.
   - This process produces ethylene and H2 without combustion products.

2. High-temperature pathway (>10% conversion):
   - BO active sites form from adsorbed O2.
   - These BO sites can abstract hydrogen from ethane to form ethylene and water.
   - This pathway involves more aggressive oxidation and can lead to some combustion products.

Key insights into the reaction mechanism:
- O2 activation is initiated by CH activation, not by direct oxidation of BN.
- The formation of BO(H) sites requires both ethane and oxygen, indicating a synergistic effect.
- The catalyst's ability to activate O2 without dissociation is crucial for preventing combustion reactions.

Implications for catalyst performance and design:
1. Temperature control is critical, as it determines which pathway dominates and affects selectivity.
2. Catalyst edge sites are crucial for activity, suggesting that increasing edge exposure could improve performance.
3. Oxygen management is essential to maintain high selectivity while avoiding over-oxidation.
4. Catalyst design should focus on optimizing the distribution and nature of BOH and BO sites.
5. Understanding the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions can guide the development of catalysts that balance activity and selectivity across a wider range of conditions.

These insights can inform strategies for catalyst synthesis, reactor design, and process optimization to achieve higher yields of ethylene while minimizing unwanted side products.

          B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，涉及表面和气相反应，显著增进了我们对整体反应网络的理解。研究揭示了两条主要反应途径，取决于温度和转化率：

1. 低温途径（&lt;10%转化率）：
   - 乙烷促进BN边缘BOH活性位点的形成。
   - 这些BOH位点在吸附O2的辅助下促进乙烷的直接脱氢。
   - 这个过程产生乙烯和H2，不产生燃烧产物。

2. 高温途径（>10%转化率）：
   - BO活性位点从吸附的O2形成。
   - 这些BO位点可以从乙烷中提取氢原子形成乙烯和水。
   - 这种途径涉及更激进的氧化，可能导致一些燃烧产物。

反应机理的关键见解：
- O2活化由CH活化引发，而不是通过BN的直接氧化。
- BO(H)位点的形成需要乙烷和氧气，表明存在协同效应。
- 催化剂激活O2而不发生解离的能力对防止燃烧反应至关重要。

对催化剂性能和设计的影响：
1. 温度控制至关重要，因为它决定了哪种途径占主导地位并影响选择性。
2. 催化剂边缘位点对活性至关重要，表明增加边缘暴露可能提高性能。
3. 氧气管理对保持高选择性同时避免过度氧化至关重要。
4. 催化剂设计应着重于优化BOH和BO位点的分布和性质。
5. 理解表面和气相反应之间的相互作用可以指导开发在更广泛条件下平衡活性和选择性的催化剂。

这些见解可以为催化剂合成、反应器设计和过程优化提供策略，以实现更高的乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副产品。
