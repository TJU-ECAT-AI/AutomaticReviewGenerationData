[1] "Our operando infrared spectroscopy and 18O isotope tracer study explicitly demonstrates that BO(H) active sites are formed at the edges of BN through the aid of ethane, and the dehydrogenation circle is completed over these BO sites by the assistance of O2."

[2] "Altogether, we were able to draw two possible catalytic pathways, as determined by the bond-breaking position of ethane (Scheme1). Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The study reveals that the reaction proceeds through different pathways depending on temperature and conversion rates.

At low temperatures and conversions, ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites at the edges of BN, which then facilitate direct dehydrogenation of ethane with the help of adsorbed O2. This process produces ethylene and H2 without combustion products.

At higher temperatures and conversions, BO active sites form from adsorbed O2, which can abstract hydrogen from ethane to produce ethylene and water. This pathway involves more aggressive oxidation and can lead to some combustion products.

The synergistic effects of surface reactions (formation of BO(H) sites) and gas-phase reactions (interaction of ethane with these sites) have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Catalyst edge sites are crucial for activity, suggesting that increasing edge exposure could improve performance.

2. The formation of BO(H) sites requires both ethane and oxygen, indicating the importance of managing reactant ratios.

3. Temperature control is critical, as it determines which pathway dominates and affects selectivity.

4. Catalyst design should focus on promoting BOH site formation while minimizing BO site formation to maintain high selectivity at higher conversions.

5. Understanding the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions can guide the development of catalysts that balance activity and selectivity across a wider range of conditions.

These insights can inform strategies for catalyst synthesis, reactor design, and process optimization to achieve higher yields of ethylene while minimizing unwanted side products.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，为我们理解整个反应网络做出了重要贡献。研究表明，反应通过不同的途径进行，取决于温度和转化率。

在低温和低转化率条件下，乙烷促进BN边缘BOH活性位点的形成，这些位点在吸附O2的帮助下促进乙烷的直接脱氢。这个过程产生乙烯和H2，不产生燃烧产物。

在高温和高转化率条件下，BO活性位点从吸附的O2形成，可以从乙烷中提取氢原子生成乙烯和水。这种途径涉及更激进的氧化，可能导致一些燃烧产物。

表面反应（BO(H)位点的形成）和气相反应（乙烷与这些位点的相互作用）的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 催化剂边缘位点对活性至关重要，表明增加边缘暴露可能提高性能。

2. BO(H)位点的形成需要乙烷和氧气，说明管理反应物比例的重要性。

3. 温度控制至关重要，因为它决定了哪种途径占主导地位并影响选择性。

4. 催化剂设计应着重于促进BOH位点形成，同时最小化BO位点形成，以在更高转化率下保持高选择性。

5. 理解表面和气相反应之间的相互作用可以指导开发在更广泛条件下平衡活性和选择性的催化剂。

这些见解可以为催化剂合成、反应器设计和过程优化提供策略，以实现更高的乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副产品。

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The study reveals that the reaction proceeds through different pathways depending on the reaction conditions, particularly temperature and conversion rates.

At low temperatures and conversions (<10%), the reaction primarily occurs on the surface, with ethane promoting the formation of BOH active sites at the edges of BN. These sites facilitate direct dehydrogenation of ethane with the aid of adsorbed O2, producing ethylene and H2. This surface-dominated mechanism allows for high selectivity towards ethylene.

At higher temperatures and conversions (>10%), the reaction becomes more complex, involving both surface and gas-phase reactions. The formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2 becomes more prominent, capable of abstracting hydrogen from ethane to form C2H4 and H2O. This shift in mechanism likely contributes to the observed decrease in selectivity at higher conversions.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Temperature control: Maintaining optimal temperatures is crucial to balance selectivity and conversion rates.

2. Active site engineering: Designing catalysts with controlled BOH/BO ratios at the edges could help maintain high selectivity even at higher conversions.

3. Oxygen management: Controlling O2 adsorption without dissociation is key to preventing combustion reactions and maintaining high selectivity.

4. Surface area optimization: High surface area BN nanosheets provide more active sites, enhancing catalytic performance.

5. Stability considerations: The catalyst's ability to maintain its structure and activity over extended periods (400h at 575°C) is crucial for practical applications.

Understanding these multidimensional aspects of the reaction mechanism allows for more targeted catalyst design, potentially leading to improved performance in terms of selectivity, conversion, and stability in ODHP reactions.

3. 氧气管理：控制O2吸附而不发生解离是防止燃烧反应和保持高选择性的关键。

4. 表面积优化：高表面积BN纳米片提供更多活性位，增强催化性能。

5. 稳定性考虑：催化剂在长时间内（575°C下400小时）保持其结构和活性的能力对实际应用至关重要。

理解反应机理的这些多维方面允许更有针对性的催化剂设计，可能导致ODHP反应中选择性、转化率和稳定性方面的性能改进。

[1] "Herein, our oxidation stability test of BN materials also showed that BN materials could not be oxidized below 800C under an O2 atmosphere (see FigureS1 in the Supporting Information), which indicated that with molecular O2 alone it was difficult to form the proposed BO species at the armchair edges under ODH reaction conditions (<600C)."

[2] "We therefore anticipated that O2 activation should be initiated by CH activation. Indeed, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane;"

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. The study reveals that the reaction mechanism is not straightforward but involves multiple steps and pathways depending on the reaction conditions.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Temperature-dependent pathways: At lower temperatures, ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, leading to direct dehydrogenation with adsorbed O2. At higher temperatures, BO active sites form from adsorbed O2, capable of abstracting hydrogen from ethane.

2. O2 activation mechanism: Molecular O2 alone cannot form BO species at armchair edges under typical ODH conditions. Instead, O2 activation is initiated by CH activation, highlighting the importance of the interplay between the reactants.

3. Active site formation: The BO(H) sites, crucial for the ODH reaction, are formed through an induction phase involving C2H6 activation. This suggests that the catalyst's active sites are not pre-existing but form during the reaction.

4. Selectivity control: The multidimensional nature of the reaction allows for high selectivity towards ethylene by preventing the formation of dissociative oxygen species (DOS) that lead to overoxidation.

These insights suggest that catalyst design should focus on optimizing the formation and stability of BO(H) active sites, controlling the O2 activation process, and maintaining the delicate balance between surface and gas-phase reactions to achieve high selectivity and conversion. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent reaction pathways indicate that precise temperature control is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance.

基于B的催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维特性，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，显著增进了我们对整体反应网络的理解。研究表明，反应机理并不简单，而是根据反应条件涉及多个步骤和途径。

表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 温度依赖的反应途径：在较低温度下，乙烷促进BOH活性位点的形成，导致与吸附O2直接脱氢。在较高温度下，BO活性位点从吸附O2形成，能够从乙烷中提取氢。

2. O2活化机制：在典型ODH条件下，单独的分子O2无法在扶手椅边缘形成BO物种。相反，O2活化由CH活化引发，突显了反应物之间相互作用的重要性。

3. 活性位点形成：对ODH反应至关重要的BO(H)位点是通过涉及C2H6活化的诱导阶段形成的。这表明催化剂的活性位点不是预先存在的，而是在反应过程中形成的。

4. 选择性控制：反应的多维特性通过防止形成导致过度氧化的解离氧物种（DOS），实现了对乙烯的高选择性。

这些见解表明，催化剂设计应该着重于优化BO(H)活性位点的形成和稳定性，控制O2活化过程，并保持表面和气相反应之间的微妙平衡，以实现高选择性和转化率。此外，温度依赖的反应途径表明，精确的温度控制对于优化催化剂性能至关重要。

The study reveals that the reaction involves both surface and gas-phase interactions, with different pathways depending on reaction conditions.

At low temperatures and conversions, the mechanism primarily involves surface reactions. Ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites on the catalyst surface, which then facilitate the dehydrogenation of ethane with the help of adsorbed O2. This process produces ethylene and H2 without combustion products.

At higher temperatures and conversions, the mechanism becomes more complex, involving both surface and gas-phase reactions.

The ability of the catalyst to promote different reaction pathways under various conditions allows for high selectivity towards ethylene at low conversions and maintained high yields at higher conversions. This versatility suggests that catalyst design should focus on creating and controlling the distribution of BOH and BO active sites to optimize performance across a range of reaction conditions.

Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of the catalyst's ability to activate O2 without dissociation, which is key to preventing combustion reactions. This insight suggests that future catalyst designs should aim to maintain this property while enhancing the formation and activity of BO(H) sites.

Overall, understanding the multidimensional nature of the reaction mechanism allows for more targeted catalyst design, potentially leading to improved performance, selectivity, and yield in the ODHP process.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts involves both surface and gas-phase reactions, contributing to a complex overall reaction network. The literature reveals that the reaction proceeds through different pathways depending on temperature and conversion levels.

At low temperatures and conversions (<10%), the mechanism primarily involves surface reactions. Ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites on the catalyst surface, which then facilitate direct dehydrogenation of ethane with the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2. This pathway results in high selectivity towards ethylene without CO2 formation.

At higher temperatures and conversions (>10%), the reaction mechanism becomes more complex, potentially involving both surface and gas-phase reactions. The formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2 becomes more prominent, capable of abstracting hydrogen atoms from ethane to form ethylene and water. This shift in mechanism suggests an interplay between surface-catalyzed reactions and possible gas-phase radical processes.

The synergistic effects of these multidimensional reaction pathways have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Temperature control: Careful temperature management is crucial to balance selectivity and conversion, as different mechanisms dominate at different temperature ranges.

2. Active site engineering: Catalyst design should focus on optimizing the distribution and nature of BOH and BO sites to enhance performance across various reaction conditions.

3. Oxygen management: The role of adsorbed O2 in both pathways highlights the importance of controlling oxygen concentration and activation to maintain high selectivity.

4. Conversion level considerations: Catalyst design must account for changes in reaction mechanism as conversion levels increase, potentially incorporating strategies to mitigate the shift towards less selective pathways at higher conversions.

5. Radical chemistry: Understanding and controlling potential gas-phase radical reactions at higher temperatures may be key to maintaining selectivity and preventing unwanted side reactions.

By considering these multidimensional aspects, researchers can develop more effective catalysts and reaction conditions for the ODHP process, potentially leading to improved yields and selectivities in industrial applications.
