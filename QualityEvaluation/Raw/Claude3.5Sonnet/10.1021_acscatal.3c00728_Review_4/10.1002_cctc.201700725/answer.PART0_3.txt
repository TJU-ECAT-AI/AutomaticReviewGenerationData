[1] "Herein, we prepared a high-surface-area BN nanosheet (s-BN) for the ODH of ethane, an alkane with only terminal CH bonds, to study the selectivity for ethylene."

[2] "Altogether, we were able to draw two possible catalytic pathways, as determined by the bond-breaking position of ethane (Scheme1). Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

[3] "At high reaction temperatures (X >10%, nonkinetic measuring region), the formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2, which is capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from ethane to form C2H4 and H2O, cannot be ruled out."

[4] "It can therefore be proposed that the presence of ethane promotes the activation of adsorbed O2 towards the edges of BN and the formation of BO(H) sites, and the dehydrogenation circle is finally completed over the BO sites."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The study reveals that the reaction involves both surface and gas-phase interactions, with different pathways depending on reaction conditions.

At low temperatures and conversions, the mechanism primarily involves surface reactions. Ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites on the catalyst surface, which then facilitate the dehydrogenation of ethane with the help of adsorbed O2. This process produces ethylene and H2 without combustion products.

At higher temperatures and conversions, the mechanism becomes more complex, involving both surface and gas-phase reactions. BO active sites form from adsorbed O2 and can abstract hydrogen from ethane to form ethylene and water. This pathway suggests a more significant role for gas-phase O2 in the reaction.

The synergistic effects of these pathways have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. The ability of the catalyst to promote different reaction pathways under various conditions allows for high selectivity towards ethylene at low conversions and maintained high yields at higher conversions. This versatility suggests that catalyst design should focus on creating and controlling the distribution of BOH and BO active sites to optimize performance across a range of reaction conditions.

Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of the catalyst's ability to activate O2 without dissociation, which is key to preventing combustion reactions. This insight suggests that future catalyst designs should aim to maintain this property while enhancing the formation and activity of BO(H) sites.

Overall, understanding the multidimensional nature of the reaction mechanism allows for more targeted catalyst design, potentially leading to improved performance, selectivity, and yield in the ODHP process.

基于B的催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性对我们理解整个反应网络做出了重大贡献。该研究揭示了反应涉及表面和气相相互作用，并且根据反应条件存在不同的反应途径。

在低温和低转化率条件下，机理主要涉及表面反应。乙烷促进催化剂表面BOH活性位点的形成，这些位点随后在吸附O2的帮助下促进乙烷脱氢。这个过程生成乙烯和H2，而不产生燃烧产物。

在较高温度和转化率下，机理变得更加复杂，同时涉及表面和气相反应。BO活性位点从吸附的O2形成，可以从乙烷中提取氢原子形成乙烯和水。这个途径表明气相O2在反应中扮演更重要的角色。

这些途径的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化具有重要意义。催化剂在各种条件下促进不同反应途径的能力使其在低转化率时具有高乙烯选择性，并在高转化率时保持高产率。这种多功能性表明，催化剂设计应该集中于创建和控制BOH和BO活性位点的分布，以在不同反应条件下优化性能。

此外，研究强调了催化剂激活O2而不发生解离的重要性，这是防止燃烧反应的关键。这一见解表明，未来的催化剂设计应该在保持这一特性的同时，增强BO(H)位点的形成和活性。

总的来说，理解反应机理的多维性允许更有针对性的催化剂设计，可能导致ODHP过程中性能、选择性和产率的提高。
