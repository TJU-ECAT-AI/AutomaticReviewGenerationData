[1] "Herein, we show that metal-free boron nitride (BN) nanosheets not only enable the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene exclusively at near 10% conversion, but they also deliver a remarkable 60% selectivity at an ethane conversion of 78% and remain stable over 400h at 575C."

[2] "Our operando infrared spectroscopy and 18O isotope tracer study explicitly demonstrates that BO(H) active sites are formed at the edges of BN through the aid of ethane, and the dehydrogenation circle is completed over these BO sites by the assistance of O2."

[3] "Altogether, we were able to draw two possible catalytic pathways, as determined by the bond-breaking position of ethane (Scheme1). Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

[4] "At high reaction temperatures (X >10%, nonkinetic measuring region), the formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2, which is capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from ethane to form C2H4 and H2O, cannot be ruled out."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The study reveals that the reaction proceeds through different pathways depending on the reaction conditions, particularly temperature and conversion rates.

At low temperatures and conversions (<10%), the reaction primarily occurs on the surface, with ethane promoting the formation of BOH active sites at the edges of BN. These sites facilitate direct dehydrogenation of ethane with the aid of adsorbed O2, producing ethylene and H2. This surface-dominated mechanism allows for high selectivity towards ethylene.

At higher temperatures and conversions (>10%), the reaction becomes more complex, involving both surface and gas-phase reactions. The formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2 becomes more prominent, capable of abstracting hydrogen from ethane to form C2H4 and H2O. This shift in mechanism likely contributes to the observed decrease in selectivity at higher conversions.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Temperature control: Maintaining optimal temperatures is crucial to balance selectivity and conversion rates.

2. Active site engineering: Designing catalysts with controlled BOH/BO ratios at the edges could help maintain high selectivity even at higher conversions.

3. Oxygen management: Controlling O2 adsorption without dissociation is key to preventing combustion reactions and maintaining high selectivity.

4. Surface area optimization: High surface area BN nanosheets provide more active sites, enhancing catalytic performance.

5. Stability considerations: The catalyst's ability to maintain its structure and activity over extended periods (400h at 575°C) is crucial for practical applications.

Understanding these multidimensional aspects of the reaction mechanism allows for more targeted catalyst design, potentially leading to improved performance in terms of selectivity, conversion, and stability in ODHP reactions.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，对我们理解整体反应网络有重要贡献。研究表明，反应通过不同的途径进行，取决于反应条件，特别是温度和转化率。

在低温和低转化率（<10%）下，反应主要发生在表面，乙烷促进BN边缘BOH活性位的形成。这些位点在吸附O2的辅助下促进乙烷的直接脱氢，生成乙烯和H2。这种以表面为主的机制允许高选择性地生成乙烯。

在较高温度和转化率（>10%）下，反应变得更加复杂，涉及表面和气相反应。从吸附O2形成BO活性位变得更加突出，能够从乙烷中提取氢以形成C2H4和H2O。这种机制的转变可能导致在较高转化率下观察到的选择性降低。

表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 温度控制：保持最佳温度对平衡选择性和转化率至关重要。

2. 活性位工程：设计具有控制BOH/BO比率的催化剂边缘可以帮助在较高转化率下保持高选择性。

3. 氧气管理：控制O2吸附而不发生解离是防止燃烧反应和保持高选择性的关键。

4. 表面积优化：高表面积BN纳米片提供更多活性位，增强催化性能。

5. 稳定性考虑：催化剂在长时间内（575°C下400小时）保持其结构和活性的能力对实际应用至关重要。

理解反应机理的这些多维方面允许更有针对性的催化剂设计，可能导致ODHP反应中选择性、转化率和稳定性方面的性能改进。
