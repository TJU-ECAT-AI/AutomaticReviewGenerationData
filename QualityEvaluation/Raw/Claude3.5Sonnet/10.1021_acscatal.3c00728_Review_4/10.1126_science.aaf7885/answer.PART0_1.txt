[1] "To date, supported vanadium oxide catalysts show the most promising activity for ODHP, owing to the favorable redox properties of the active vanadium sites (6, 7). However, even after decades of research, propene selectivity remains too low, even at moderate propane conversion."

[2] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[3] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

[4] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical (Fig. 3C). This reaction is reminiscent of an alkyl hydroperoxide reaction proposed earlier to explain the formation of radicals in homogeneous autoxidation systems (ROOH + HR  RO• + HOH + •R) (33)."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network and has important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization.

The proposed mechanism involves a unique interplay between surface-catalyzed reactions and gas-phase radical processes. The oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) acts as the active site, initiating the reaction by abstracting a hydrogen atom from propane. This creates surface-bound species and radical intermediates, which then undergo further reactions.

The one-dimensional nature of the BN edge plays a crucial role in achieving high olefin selectivity. It stabilizes the propyl radical intermediate, avoiding the formation of highly reactive species that are typical of zero-dimensional single-site catalysts. This stabilization helps prevent overoxidation, which is a common problem with two-dimensional surface catalysts.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have several implications for catalyst performance and design:

1. Enhanced selectivity: The unique mechanism allows for better control of intermediate species, leading to higher selectivity towards desired olefins.

2. Improved efficiency: The combination of surface-catalyzed and radical processes may contribute to the observed high activity and productivity of BN-based catalysts.

3. Novel design principles: Understanding the multidimensional nature of the reaction network opens up new possibilities for catalyst design, focusing on creating and optimizing specific edge structures and active sites.

4. Potential for further optimization: By manipulating the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions, it may be possible to further enhance catalyst performance and selectivity.

5. New insights for related reactions: The mechanistic understanding gained from this system could be applied to other partial oxidation reactions, potentially leading to improvements in various industrial processes.

In summary, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts provides a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes. This knowledge can guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP and related reactions, potentially leading to significant advancements in the field of heterogeneous catalysis.
