[1] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

[2] "Starting from our modeled active site (namely, >BOON<), we then calculated key intermediates for the ODHP reaction. We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical (Fig. 3C). This reaction is reminiscent of an alkyl hydroperoxide reaction proposed earlier to explain the formation of radicals in homogeneous autoxidation systems (ROOH + HR  RO• + HOH + •R) (33)."

[3] "However, in the case of the surface-catalyzed reaction, we anticipate a rebound step where the secondary propyl radical reacts rapidly with the nitroxyl radical, forming a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate [namely, >NOCH(CH3)2] (Fig. 3D)."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network by highlighting the interplay between surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This understanding has several implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Selective radical stabilization: The one-dimensional nature of the oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) allows for the stabilization of propyl radicals by nitroxyl radical sites. This stabilization is crucial for preventing overoxidation and maintaining high olefin selectivity.

2. Controlled reactivity: The 1D edge structure strikes a balance between the high reactivity of 0D single-site catalysts and the unrestricted diffusion on 2D surface catalysts. This controlled reactivity helps to prevent the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppresses overoxidation of adsorbed species.

3. Surface-gas phase synergy: The mechanism involves both surface-catalyzed reactions and gas-phase radical processes. The initial hydrogen abstraction occurs on the catalyst surface, followed by a rapid rebound step where the propyl radical reacts with the surface-bound nitroxyl radical. This synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for better control of the reaction pathway.

4. Design implications: Understanding this multidimensional mechanism suggests that catalyst design should focus on optimizing the density and accessibility of the 1D edge sites (>BOON<) to maximize selectivity and activity. The goal would be to create materials with a high proportion of these active edge sites while maintaining their 1D nature.

5. Kinetic control: The proposed mechanism provides insights into how the catalyst structure influences reaction kinetics. By controlling the formation and stabilization of key intermediates, the catalyst can guide the reaction towards desired products.

6. Potential for further optimization: With this mechanistic understanding, researchers can explore modifications to the BN structure or edge functionalization to further enhance selectivity and activity, potentially leading to even more efficient ODHP catalysts.

This multidimensional understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts provides a foundation for rational catalyst design and optimization, potentially leading to more efficient and selective processes for propene production.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network and has important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization.

The proposed mechanism involves a unique interplay between surface-catalyzed reactions and gas-phase radical processes. The oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) acts as the active site, initiating the reaction by abstracting a hydrogen atom from propane. This creates surface-bound species and radical intermediates, which then undergo further reactions.

The one-dimensional nature of the BN edge plays a crucial role in achieving high olefin selectivity. It stabilizes the propyl radical intermediate, avoiding the formation of highly reactive species that are typical of zero-dimensional single-site catalysts. This stabilization helps prevent overoxidation, which is a common problem with two-dimensional surface catalysts.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have several implications for catalyst performance and design:

1. Enhanced selectivity: The unique mechanism allows for better control of intermediate species, leading to higher selectivity towards desired olefins.

2. Improved efficiency: The combination of surface-catalyzed and radical processes may contribute to the observed high activity and productivity of BN-based catalysts.

3. Novel design principles: Understanding the multidimensional nature of the reaction network opens up new possibilities for catalyst design, focusing on creating and optimizing specific edge structures and active sites.

4. Potential for further optimization: By manipulating the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions, it may be possible to further enhance catalyst performance and selectivity.

5. New insights for related reactions: The mechanistic understanding gained from this system could be applied to other partial oxidation reactions, potentially leading to improvements in various industrial processes.

In summary, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts provides a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase processes. This knowledge can guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP and related reactions, potentially leading to significant advancements in the field of heterogeneous catalysis.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The mechanism encompasses both surface reactions on the catalyst and gas-phase radical reactions, which work synergistically to enhance catalyst performance.

The proposed mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from propane by the >BOON< sites on the catalyst surface, forming a B-OH species and a nitroxyl radical. This step is followed by a radical rebound, where the propyl radical reacts with the nitroxyl radical to form a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate. The one-dimensional nature of the catalyst edge plays a crucial role in stabilizing these intermediates, avoiding the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppressing overoxidation.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions are evident in the second-order rate dependence with respect to propane concentration. This suggests that two propane molecules are involved in the reaction, generating two water molecules and creating BN edge vacancies that facilitate unique oxygen activation.

These insights have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. The one-dimensional nature of the active sites contributes to high olefin selectivity by stabilizing reaction intermediates and preventing overoxidation. This understanding can guide the development of catalysts with controlled dimensionality and optimized edge structures to enhance selectivity and activity.

Furthermore, the role of oxygen activation at BN edge vacancies highlights the importance of controlling surface oxygen coverage for optimal catalyst performance. This knowledge can inform strategies for tailoring catalyst synthesis and reaction conditions to achieve the desired balance between activity and selectivity in ODHP reactions.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The proposed mechanism involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, which work synergistically to achieve high olefin selectivity and unique reaction kinetics.

The one-dimensional nature of the oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) acts as the active site for the ODHP reaction. This 1D structure plays a crucial role in stabilizing the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site, which is key to achieving high olefin selectivity. Unlike 0D single-site catalysts that create highly reactive propyl radicals or 2D surface catalysts that allow unrestricted diffusion of adsorbates, the 1D edge structure of BN-based catalysts suppresses overoxidation of adsorbed species.

The reaction mechanism also involves gas-phase interactions, as evidenced by the second-order rate dependence with respect to propane concentration. This suggests that two propane molecules are required to generate two water molecules, which is consistent with the overall reaction stoichiometry. The desorption of these water molecules creates BN edge vacancies that enable unique oxygen activation, explaining the influence of adsorbed oxygen surface coverage on the rate of propane consumption.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. Understanding this multidimensional nature allows for the development of catalysts with improved selectivity and activity. By fine-tuning the 1D edge structure and controlling the oxygen activation process, it may be possible to further enhance the catalyst's performance in terms of olefin selectivity and propane conversion rates.

Moreover, this new understanding of the reaction mechanism opens up possibilities for designing novel catalysts that exploit similar multidimensional effects. It suggests that other materials with 1D edge structures or those capable of stabilizing radical intermediates could potentially be effective catalysts for ODHP or similar partial oxidation reactions.

In summary, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing catalyst design and performance, potentially leading to more efficient and selective catalysts for the production of valuable olefins.
