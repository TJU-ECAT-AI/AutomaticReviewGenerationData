[1] "To elucidate the origin of these vibrations, we performed ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) (31, 32). All computational details are given in the supplementary materials. We focused on a single BN sheet and calculated vibrational frequencies for a set of OH-terminated zigzag and armchair edges."

[2] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[3] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

[4] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical (Fig. 3C). This reaction is reminiscent of an alkyl hydroperoxide reaction proposed earlier to explain the formation of radicals in homogeneous autoxidation systems (ROOH + HR  RO• + HOH + •R) (33)."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network by revealing the interplay between surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This understanding has several implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Active Site Structure: The research identifies oxygen-terminated armchair edges of boron nitride (>BOON<) as the likely active sites for the ODHP reaction. This insight helps in focusing on specific structural features when designing and optimizing catalysts.

2. Selectivity Control: The one-dimensional nature of the edge sites plays a crucial role in achieving high olefin selectivity. It allows for the stabilization of propyl radicals, preventing overoxidation that typically occurs with 0D single-site catalysts or 2D surface catalysts.

3. Reaction Mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves a radical rebound process, which is different from traditional supported metal catalysts. This unique mechanism contributes to the high selectivity observed with B-based catalysts.

4. Surface-Gas Phase Interactions: The mechanism suggests a complex interplay between surface-bound species and gas-phase reactions, involving the formation and stabilization of radical intermediates.

5. Catalyst Design Strategy: Understanding the importance of edge sites and their dimensionality provides a clear direction for catalyst design, focusing on maximizing the number of these specific active sites.

6. Kinetics and Modeling: The insights into the reaction mechanism allow for more accurate kinetic modeling, which can be used to predict and optimize reactor performance.

7. New Materials Exploration: The success of boron nitride-based materials opens up possibilities for exploring other similar materials or modifications that could further enhance catalytic performance.

These insights collectively contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the ODHP reaction network and provide a foundation for rational catalyst design and process optimization in the pursuit of more efficient and selective propene production.
