[1] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical (Fig. 3C). This reaction is reminiscent of an alkyl hydroperoxide reaction proposed earlier to explain the formation of radicals in homogeneous autoxidation systems (ROOH + HR  RO• + HOH + •R) (33)."

[2] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

[3] "The second-order rate dependence with respect to Pc3h8 suggests that two propane molecules are required to generate two molecules of water, in line with the overall stoichiometry of the reaction. The desorption of these water molecules forms BN edge vacancies that allow for unique O2 activation, which explains the influence that the surface coverage of adsorbed oxygen has on the rate of propane consumption."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The mechanism encompasses both surface reactions on the catalyst and gas-phase radical reactions, which work synergistically to enhance catalyst performance.

The proposed mechanism involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from propane by the >BOON< sites on the catalyst surface, forming a B-OH species and a nitroxyl radical. This step is followed by a radical rebound, where the propyl radical reacts with the nitroxyl radical to form a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate. The one-dimensional nature of the catalyst edge plays a crucial role in stabilizing these intermediates, avoiding the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppressing overoxidation.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions are evident in the second-order rate dependence with respect to propane concentration. This suggests that two propane molecules are involved in the reaction, generating two water molecules and creating BN edge vacancies that facilitate unique oxygen activation.

These insights have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. The one-dimensional nature of the active sites contributes to high olefin selectivity by stabilizing reaction intermediates and preventing overoxidation. This understanding can guide the development of catalysts with controlled dimensionality and optimized edge structures to enhance selectivity and activity.

Furthermore, the role of oxygen activation at BN edge vacancies highlights the importance of controlling surface oxygen coverage for optimal catalyst performance. This knowledge can inform strategies for tailoring catalyst synthesis and reaction conditions to achieve the desired balance between activity and selectivity in ODHP reactions.
