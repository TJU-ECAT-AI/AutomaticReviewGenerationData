          "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

"Starting from our modeled active site (namely, >BOON<), we then calculated key intermediates for the ODHP reaction. We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical (Fig. 3C). This reaction is reminiscent of an alkyl hydroperoxide reaction proposed earlier to explain the formation of radicals in homogeneous autoxidation systems (ROOH + HR  RO• + HOH + •R) (33)."

"The second-order rate dependence with respect to Pc3h8 suggests that two propane molecules are required to generate two molecules of water, in line with the overall stoichiometry of the reaction. The desorption of these water molecules forms BN edge vacancies that allow for unique O2 activation, which explains the influence that the surface coverage of adsorbed oxygen has on the rate of propane consumption."

          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network by revealing the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This understanding has several key implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Active Site Structure: The oxygen-terminated armchair edges of boron nitride (>BOON<) are identified as the likely active sites for the ODHP reaction. This insight helps focus catalyst design on specific structural features.

2. Selectivity Control: The one-dimensional nature of the edge sites plays a crucial role in achieving high olefin selectivity. It allows for the stabilization of propyl radicals, preventing overoxidation that typically occurs with 0D single-site catalysts or 2D surface catalysts.

3. Reaction Mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves a radical rebound process, which differs from traditional supported metal catalysts. This unique mechanism contributes to the high selectivity observed with B-based catalysts.

4. Surface-Gas Phase Interactions: The mechanism suggests a complex interplay between surface-bound species and gas-phase reactions, involving the formation and stabilization of radical intermediates.

5. Kinetics and Stoichiometry: The second-order rate dependence on propane concentration indicates that two propane molecules are involved in the reaction, generating two water molecules. This aligns with the overall reaction stoichiometry and provides insights into the reaction kinetics.

6. Oxygen Activation: The desorption of water molecules creates BN edge vacancies, allowing for unique O2 activation. This explains the influence of adsorbed oxygen surface coverage on the rate of propane consumption.

These insights collectively contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the ODHP reaction network and provide a foundation for rational catalyst design and process optimization in the pursuit of more efficient and selective propene production.

          基于硼的催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质对我们理解整个反应网络的贡献显著，揭示了表面反应和气相自由基反应之间的复杂相互作用。这种理解对催化剂性能和设计优化有几个关键影响：

1. 活性位点结构：氧化硼氮化物的扶手椅边缘（>BOON<）被确定为ODHP反应的可能活性位点。这一洞见有助于将催化剂设计集中在特定的结构特征上。

2. 选择性控制：边缘位点的一维性质在实现高烯烃选择性方面起着关键作用。它允许稳定丙基自由基，防止通常在0D单一位点催化剂或2D表面催化剂上发生的过度氧化。

3. 反应机理：提出的机理涉及自由基反弹过程，这与传统的负载金属催化剂不同。这种独特的机理有助于解释B基催化剂观察到的高选择性。

4. 表面-气相相互作用：该机理表明表面结合物种和气相反应之间存在复杂的相互作用，涉及自由基中间体的形成和稳定。

5. 动力学和化学计量：丙烷浓度的二级速率依赖性表明两个丙烷分子参与反应，生成两个水分子。这与整体反应化学计量相一致，并为反应动力学提供了见解。

6. 氧气活化：水分子的脱附创造了BN边缘空位，允许独特的O2活化。这解释了吸附氧表面覆盖率对丙烷消耗速率的影响。

这些见解共同为ODHP反应网络提供了更全面的理解，并为理性催化剂设计和过程优化奠定了基础，以追求更高效和选择性的丙烯生产。
