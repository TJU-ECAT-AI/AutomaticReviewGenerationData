[1] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

[2] "Starting from our modeled active site (namely, >BOON<), we then calculated key intermediates for the ODHP reaction. We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical (Fig. 3C). This reaction is reminiscent of an alkyl hydroperoxide reaction proposed earlier to explain the formation of radicals in homogeneous autoxidation systems (ROOH + HR  RO• + HOH + •R) (33)."

[3] "However, in the case of the surface-catalyzed reaction, we anticipate a rebound step where the secondary propyl radical reacts rapidly with the nitroxyl radical, forming a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate [namely, >NOCH(CH3)2] (Fig. 3D)."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network by highlighting the interplay between surface and gas-phase radical reactions. This understanding has several implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Selective radical stabilization: The one-dimensional nature of the oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) allows for the stabilization of propyl radicals by nitroxyl radical sites. This stabilization is crucial for preventing overoxidation and maintaining high olefin selectivity.

2. Controlled reactivity: The 1D edge structure strikes a balance between the high reactivity of 0D single-site catalysts and the unrestricted diffusion on 2D surface catalysts. This controlled reactivity helps to prevent the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppresses overoxidation of adsorbed species.

3. Surface-gas phase synergy: The mechanism involves both surface-catalyzed reactions and gas-phase radical processes. The initial hydrogen abstraction occurs on the catalyst surface, followed by a rapid rebound step where the propyl radical reacts with the surface-bound nitroxyl radical. This synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for better control of the reaction pathway.

4. Design implications: Understanding this multidimensional mechanism suggests that catalyst design should focus on optimizing the density and accessibility of the 1D edge sites (>BOON<) to maximize selectivity and activity. The goal would be to create materials with a high proportion of these active edge sites while maintaining their 1D nature.

5. Kinetic control: The proposed mechanism provides insights into how the catalyst structure influences reaction kinetics. By controlling the formation and stabilization of key intermediates, the catalyst can guide the reaction towards desired products.

6. Potential for further optimization: With this mechanistic understanding, researchers can explore modifications to the BN structure or edge functionalization to further enhance selectivity and activity, potentially leading to even more efficient ODHP catalysts.

This multidimensional understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts provides a foundation for rational catalyst design and optimization, potentially leading to more efficient and selective processes for propene production.
