[1] "The combination of the interesting observations outlined in this work (i.e., improved selectivity to olefins and different reaction kinetics) points toward a fundamentally different reaction mechanism in conjunction with a different active site compared with other, previously studied and better understood catalysts for this reaction."

[2] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[3] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

[4] "The second-order rate dependence with respect to Pc3h8 suggests that two propane molecules are required to generate two molecules of water, in line with the overall stoichiometry of the reaction. The desorption of these water molecules forms BN edge vacancies that allow for unique O2 activation, which explains the influence that the surface coverage of adsorbed oxygen has on the rate of propane consumption."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The proposed mechanism involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, which work synergistically to achieve high olefin selectivity and unique reaction kinetics.

The one-dimensional nature of the oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) acts as the active site for the ODHP reaction. This 1D structure plays a crucial role in stabilizing the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site, which is key to achieving high olefin selectivity. Unlike 0D single-site catalysts that create highly reactive propyl radicals or 2D surface catalysts that allow unrestricted diffusion of adsorbates, the 1D edge structure of BN-based catalysts suppresses overoxidation of adsorbed species.

The reaction mechanism also involves gas-phase interactions, as evidenced by the second-order rate dependence with respect to propane concentration. This suggests that two propane molecules are required to generate two water molecules, which is consistent with the overall reaction stoichiometry. The desorption of these water molecules creates BN edge vacancies that enable unique oxygen activation, explaining the influence of adsorbed oxygen surface coverage on the rate of propane consumption.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. Understanding this multidimensional nature allows for the development of catalysts with improved selectivity and activity. By fine-tuning the 1D edge structure and controlling the oxygen activation process, it may be possible to further enhance the catalyst's performance in terms of olefin selectivity and propane conversion rates.

Moreover, this new understanding of the reaction mechanism opens up possibilities for designing novel catalysts that exploit similar multidimensional effects. It suggests that other materials with 1D edge structures or those capable of stabilizing radical intermediates could potentially be effective catalysts for ODHP or similar partial oxidation reactions.

In summary, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing catalyst design and performance, potentially leading to more efficient and selective catalysts for the production of valuable olefins.

基于硼的催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维特性对我们理解整个反应网络做出了重大贡献。提出的机理涉及表面和气相自由基反应，它们协同工作以实现高烯烃选择性和独特的反应动力学。

氧化硼氮纳米材料(>BOON<)的氧端接扶手边缘的一维性质作为ODHP反应的活性位点。这种1D结构在通过亚硝基自由基位点稳定丙基自由基方面起着关键作用，这是实现高烯烃选择性的关键。与产生高活性丙基自由基的0D单一位点催化剂或允许吸附物无限制扩散的2D表面催化剂不同，基于BN的催化剂的1D边缘结构抑制了吸附物种的过度氧化。

反应机理还涉及气相相互作用，这从丙烷浓度的二级速率依赖性可以得到证实。这表明需要两个丙烷分子产生两个水分子，这与整体反应化学计量相一致。这些水分子的脱附创造了BN边缘空位，实现了独特的氧气活化，解释了吸附氧表面覆盖率对丙烷消耗速率的影响。

表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化具有重要影响。理解这种多维性质允许开发具有改进的选择性和活性的催化剂。通过微调1D边缘结构和控制氧气活化过程，可能进一步提高催化剂在烯烃选择性和丙烷转化率方面的性能。

此外，对反应机理的这种新理解为设计利用类似多维效应的新型催化剂开辟了可能性。这表明具有1D边缘结构或能够稳定自由基中间体的其他材料可能是ODHP或类似部分氧化反应的有效催化剂。

总之，基于硼的催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质提供了对表面和气相反应相互作用的全面理解。这些知识对于优化催化剂设计和性能至关重要，可能会导致更高效和选择性的催化剂用于生产有价值的烯烃。
