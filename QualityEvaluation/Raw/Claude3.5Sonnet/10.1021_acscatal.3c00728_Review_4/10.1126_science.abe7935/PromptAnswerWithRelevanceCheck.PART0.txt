The literature provided does not discuss the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts in terms of surface and gas-phase radical reactions. The study focuses primarily on the isolated boron sites in zeolite frameworks and their catalytic performance in ODHP, without delving into the details of gas-phase radical reactions or their synergistic effects with surface reactions. The paper mainly explores the structure and stability of the boron sites, their hydroxyl groups, and the proposed reaction mechanism on these sites. Without specific information on the multidimensional aspects of the reaction network, it is not possible to directly answer the question about their synergistic effects and implications for catalyst performance and design optimization based solely on the given literature.

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a key technology for producing propene from shale gas, but conventional metal oxide catalysts are prone to overoxidation to form valueless COx."

[2] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."

[3] "To better understand the active sites, the kinetic parameters in ODHP have been measured (figs. S49 and S50). The BS-1 catalyst had a first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure, whereas the supported boron and hBN had a second-order rate dependence (fig. S49) (19)."

[4] "The reaction pathway of propane dehydrogenation on BS-1 was explored using density functional theory calculation (figs. S51 to S54), where the catalyst framework was taken into account by the extended cluster model with isolated boron functionalized with one or two hydroxyl groups."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The literature suggests that isolated boron in a zeolite framework exhibits different behavior compared to conventional catalysts or supported boron species.

The reaction involves both surface interactions and gas-phase processes. On the surface, the isolated boron sites in the zeolite framework play a crucial role in activating both propane and oxygen. The gas-phase component likely involves radical species formed during the reaction.

The synergistic effects of these multidimensional processes have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Selectivity: The isolated boron sites in the zeolite framework help prevent overoxidation, leading to higher selectivity towards desired products (propene and ethene) rather than COx.

2. Activity: The unique structure of isolated boron sites, particularly those with dihydroxyl groups, enables efficient activation of both propane and oxygen, contributing to high catalytic activity.

3. Stability: The zeolite framework hinders full hydrolysis of boron species, providing excellent durability and water tolerance.

4. Reaction kinetics: The first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure for the BS-1 catalyst, as opposed to the second-order dependence for supported boron and h-BN, suggests a different reaction mechanism that could be exploited for improved performance.

5. Catalyst design: Understanding the role of isolated boron sites and their local environment (e.g., presence of nearby silanol groups) provides insights for rational catalyst design, potentially leading to more efficient ODHP catalysts.

These findings highlight the importance of considering both surface and gas-phase processes in catalyst development, as well as the potential for tuning the coordination environment of active sites to optimize performance. This multidimensional approach to understanding and designing ODHP catalysts could lead to significant advancements in the field and potentially scalable applications for propene production from shale gas.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性对我们理解整体反应网络做出了重大贡献。文献表明，沸石骨架中的孤立硼表现出与传统催化剂或负载型硼物种不同的行为。

该反应涉及表面相互作用和气相过程。在表面上，沸石骨架中的孤立硼位点在活化丙烷和氧气方面起着关键作用。气相组分可能涉及反应过程中形成的自由基物种。

这些多维过程的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 选择性：沸石骨架中的孤立硼位点有助于防止过度氧化，从而提高了目标产物（丙烯和乙烯）的选择性，而不是生成COx。

2. 活性：孤立硼位点的独特结构，特别是那些具有二羟基的位点，能够有效地活化丙烷和氧气，从而提高催化活性。

3. 稳定性：沸石骨架阻碍了硼物种的完全水解，提供了优异的耐久性和耐水性。

4. 反应动力学：BS-1催化剂对丙烷分压的一级反应级数依赖性，与负载型硼和h-BN的二级依赖性不同，表明存在不同的反应机理，这可能被用于提高性能。

5. 催化剂设计：理解孤立硼位点及其局部环境（如附近硅羟基的存在）的作用，为合理设计催化剂提供了见解，可能导致更高效的ODHP催化剂。

这些发现强调了在催化剂开发中考虑表面和气相过程的重要性，以及调整活性位点配位环境以优化性能的潜力。这种对ODHP催化剂的多维理解和设计方法可能导致该领域的重大进展，并有望在页岩气制丙烯方面实现规模化应用。

[1] "For these catalysts, the BOB oligomers are generally regarded as active centers (2628), whereas a single-site boron in zeolite (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."

[2] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[3] "To better understand the active sites, the kinetic parameters in ODHP have been measured (figs. S49 and S50). The BS-1 catalyst had a first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure, whereas the supported boron and hBN had a second-order rate dependence (fig. S49) (19)."

[4] "For the catalyst with a dihydroxyl group on boron, O2 and C3H8 were initially coadsorbed on one hydroxyl group through weak van der Waals interaction (R; figs. S51 and S52). The other hydroxyl group in boron was able to form a hydrogen bond with SiOH and further constrain O2, as shown in Fig. 3D."

The literature does not directly address the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or explicitly discuss gas-phase radical reactions. However, the study provides insights into the surface reactions and catalyst design that contribute to our understanding of the overall reaction network.

The research reveals that isolated boron species in zeolite frameworks, specifically with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure, can act as active centers for ODHP. This finding challenges the previous understanding that BOB oligomers were the primary active sites for B-based catalysts in ODHP reactions.

The kinetic studies show different rate dependencies for the BS-1 catalyst (first-order) compared to supported boron and h-BN catalysts (second-order). This suggests distinct reaction mechanisms for isolated boron species versus oligomeric boron structures.

The study also provides detailed insights into the surface reaction mechanism, describing how O2 and C3H8 coadsorb on the dihydroxyl boron sites and interact with nearby silanol groups. This molecular-level understanding of the catalyst surface reactions contributes to the overall comprehension of the ODHP reaction network.

While the study does not explicitly discuss gas-phase radical reactions, the detailed surface mechanism insights and the novel active site structure provide a foundation for future research to explore potential synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions.

These findings have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. By understanding the role of isolated boron species and their specific structural requirements (e.g., B[OHO(H)Si]2), researchers can now focus on designing catalysts that maximize these active sites. This could lead to the development of more efficient and selective ODHP catalysts, potentially improving propene yields and catalyst stability.

虽然文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂ODHP反应机理的多维性质或明确讨论气相自由基反应，但该研究提供了关于表面反应和催化剂设计的见解，这有助于我们理解整个反应网络。

研究揭示了沸石框架中的孤立硼物种，特别是具有B[OHO(H)Si]2结构的物种，可以作为ODHP的活性中心。这一发现挑战了先前认为BOB寡聚体是ODHP反应中B基催化剂主要活性位点的理解。

动力学研究显示，BS-1催化剂（一级）与负载型硼和h-BN催化剂（二级）具有不同的反应级数依赖性。这表明孤立硼物种与寡聚硼结构具有不同的反应机理。

该研究还详细描述了表面反应机理，解释了O2和C3H8如何在二羟基硼位点上共吸附并与附近的硅醇基团相互作用。这种对催化剂表面反应的分子水平理解有助于全面理解ODHP反应网络。

虽然该研究没有明确讨论气相自由基反应，但对表面机理的详细见解和新型活性位点结构为未来研究探索表面反应和气相反应之间潜在的协同效应提供了基础。

这些发现对催化剂性能和设计优化具有重要意义。通过理解孤立硼物种的作用及其特定的结构要求（如B[OHO(H)Si]2），研究人员现在可以专注于设计能最大化这些活性位点的催化剂。这可能导致开发出更高效、更选择性的ODHP催化剂，潜在地提高丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性。

The literature provided does not directly address the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or discuss gas-phase radical reactions. The study focuses primarily on the performance and characterization of isolated boron sites in zeolite catalysts for ODHP, without exploring the broader reaction network including gas-phase reactions. Therefore, this specific question cannot be fully answered based solely on the information given in the document.

However, the study does provide some insights into the surface reactions and catalyst design that may be relevant to understanding the overall ODHP process:

1. The research demonstrates that isolated boron sites in zeolite frameworks, particularly those with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure, are highly active for ODHP.

2. The catalyst shows high selectivity for olefins (propene and ethene) with minimal overoxidation to COx, suggesting a controlled surface reaction mechanism.

3. The zeolite structure appears to play a role in stabilizing the boron sites and preventing full hydrolysis, which contributes to catalyst durability.

4. Density functional theory calculations suggest a reaction pathway involving the co-adsorption of O2 and C3H8 on the boron hydroxyl groups, with the zeolite framework providing confinement effects that influence reaction barriers.

These findings imply that optimizing the coordination environment of boron sites and leveraging the zeolite structure could be key strategies for improving ODHP catalyst performance. However, a more comprehensive study considering both surface and gas-phase reactions would be necessary to fully understand the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction network and its implications for catalyst design.

提供的文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，也没有涉及气相自由基反应。这项研究主要集中在沸石催化剂中孤立硼位点在ODHP反应中的性能和表征，而没有探讨包括气相反应在内的更广泛的反应网络。因此，仅基于文档中给出的信息无法全面回答这个具体问题。

然而，该研究确实提供了一些关于表面反应和催化剂设计的见解，这些可能与理解整个ODHP过程有关：

1. 研究表明，沸石骨架中的孤立硼位点，特别是具有B[OHO(H)Si]2结构的位点，对ODHP具有高活性。

2. 催化剂对烯烃（丙烯和乙烯）表现出高选择性，同时极少过度氧化生成COx，这表明存在受控的表面反应机制。

3. 沸石结构似乎在稳定硼位点和防止完全水解方面发挥了作用，这有助于催化剂的耐久性。

4. 密度泛函理论计算表明，反应途径涉及O2和C3H8在硼羟基上的共吸附，而沸石骨架提供的限域效应影响了反应能垒。

这些发现意味着优化硼位点的配位环境和利用沸石结构可能是改善ODHP催化剂性能的关键策略。然而，要全面理解ODHP反应网络的多维性质及其对催化剂设计的影响，还需要进行一项同时考虑表面和气相反应的更全面的研究。
