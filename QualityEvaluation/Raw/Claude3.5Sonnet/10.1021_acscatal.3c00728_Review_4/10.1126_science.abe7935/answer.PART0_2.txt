[1] "For these catalysts, the BOB oligomers are generally regarded as active centers (2628), whereas a single-site boron in zeolite (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."

[2] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[3] "To better understand the active sites, the kinetic parameters in ODHP have been measured (figs. S49 and S50). The BS-1 catalyst had a first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure, whereas the supported boron and hBN had a second-order rate dependence (fig. S49) (19)."

[4] "For the catalyst with a dihydroxyl group on boron, O2 and C3H8 were initially coadsorbed on one hydroxyl group through weak van der Waals interaction (R; figs. S51 and S52). The other hydroxyl group in boron was able to form a hydrogen bond with SiOH and further constrain O2, as shown in Fig. 3D."

The literature does not directly address the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or explicitly discuss gas-phase radical reactions. However, the study provides insights into the surface reactions and catalyst design that contribute to our understanding of the overall reaction network.

The research reveals that isolated boron species in zeolite frameworks, specifically with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure, can act as active centers for ODHP. This finding challenges the previous understanding that BOB oligomers were the primary active sites for B-based catalysts in ODHP reactions.

The kinetic studies show different rate dependencies for the BS-1 catalyst (first-order) compared to supported boron and h-BN catalysts (second-order). This suggests distinct reaction mechanisms for isolated boron species versus oligomeric boron structures.

The study also provides detailed insights into the surface reaction mechanism, describing how O2 and C3H8 coadsorb on the dihydroxyl boron sites and interact with nearby silanol groups. This molecular-level understanding of the catalyst surface reactions contributes to the overall comprehension of the ODHP reaction network.

While the study does not explicitly discuss gas-phase radical reactions, the detailed surface mechanism insights and the novel active site structure provide a foundation for future research to explore potential synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions.

These findings have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. By understanding the role of isolated boron species and their specific structural requirements (e.g., B[OHO(H)Si]2), researchers can now focus on designing catalysts that maximize these active sites. This could lead to the development of more efficient and selective ODHP catalysts, potentially improving propene yields and catalyst stability.

虽然文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂ODHP反应机理的多维性质或明确讨论气相自由基反应，但该研究提供了关于表面反应和催化剂设计的见解，这有助于我们理解整个反应网络。

研究揭示了沸石框架中的孤立硼物种，特别是具有B[OHO(H)Si]2结构的物种，可以作为ODHP的活性中心。这一发现挑战了先前认为BOB寡聚体是ODHP反应中B基催化剂主要活性位点的理解。

动力学研究显示，BS-1催化剂（一级）与负载型硼和h-BN催化剂（二级）具有不同的反应级数依赖性。这表明孤立硼物种与寡聚硼结构具有不同的反应机理。

该研究还详细描述了表面反应机理，解释了O2和C3H8如何在二羟基硼位点上共吸附并与附近的硅醇基团相互作用。这种对催化剂表面反应的分子水平理解有助于全面理解ODHP反应网络。

虽然该研究没有明确讨论气相自由基反应，但对表面机理的详细见解和新型活性位点结构为未来研究探索表面反应和气相反应之间潜在的协同效应提供了基础。

这些发现对催化剂性能和设计优化具有重要意义。通过理解孤立硼物种的作用及其特定的结构要求（如B[OHO(H)Si]2），研究人员现在可以专注于设计能最大化这些活性位点的催化剂。这可能导致开发出更高效、更选择性的ODHP催化剂，潜在地提高丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性。
