[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a key technology for producing propene from shale gas, but conventional metal oxide catalysts are prone to overoxidation to form valueless COx."

[2] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."

[3] "To better understand the active sites, the kinetic parameters in ODHP have been measured (figs. S49 and S50). The BS-1 catalyst had a first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure, whereas the supported boron and hBN had a second-order rate dependence (fig. S49) (19)."

[4] "The reaction pathway of propane dehydrogenation on BS-1 was explored using density functional theory calculation (figs. S51 to S54), where the catalyst framework was taken into account by the extended cluster model with isolated boron functionalized with one or two hydroxyl groups."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The literature suggests that isolated boron in a zeolite framework exhibits different behavior compared to conventional catalysts or supported boron species.

The reaction involves both surface interactions and gas-phase processes. On the surface, the isolated boron sites in the zeolite framework play a crucial role in activating both propane and oxygen. The gas-phase component likely involves radical species formed during the reaction.

The synergistic effects of these multidimensional processes have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Selectivity: The isolated boron sites in the zeolite framework help prevent overoxidation, leading to higher selectivity towards desired products (propene and ethene) rather than COx.

2. Activity: The unique structure of isolated boron sites, particularly those with dihydroxyl groups, enables efficient activation of both propane and oxygen, contributing to high catalytic activity.

3. Stability: The zeolite framework hinders full hydrolysis of boron species, providing excellent durability and water tolerance.

4. Reaction kinetics: The first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure for the BS-1 catalyst, as opposed to the second-order dependence for supported boron and h-BN, suggests a different reaction mechanism that could be exploited for improved performance.

5. Catalyst design: Understanding the role of isolated boron sites and their local environment (e.g., presence of nearby silanol groups) provides insights for rational catalyst design, potentially leading to more efficient ODHP catalysts.

These findings highlight the importance of considering both surface and gas-phase processes in catalyst development, as well as the potential for tuning the coordination environment of active sites to optimize performance. This multidimensional approach to understanding and designing ODHP catalysts could lead to significant advancements in the field and potentially scalable applications for propene production from shale gas.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性对我们理解整体反应网络做出了重大贡献。文献表明，沸石骨架中的孤立硼表现出与传统催化剂或负载型硼物种不同的行为。

该反应涉及表面相互作用和气相过程。在表面上，沸石骨架中的孤立硼位点在活化丙烷和氧气方面起着关键作用。气相组分可能涉及反应过程中形成的自由基物种。

这些多维过程的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 选择性：沸石骨架中的孤立硼位点有助于防止过度氧化，从而提高了目标产物（丙烯和乙烯）的选择性，而不是生成COx。

2. 活性：孤立硼位点的独特结构，特别是那些具有二羟基的位点，能够有效地活化丙烷和氧气，从而提高催化活性。

3. 稳定性：沸石骨架阻碍了硼物种的完全水解，提供了优异的耐久性和耐水性。

4. 反应动力学：BS-1催化剂对丙烷分压的一级反应级数依赖性，与负载型硼和h-BN的二级依赖性不同，表明存在不同的反应机理，这可能被用于提高性能。

5. 催化剂设计：理解孤立硼位点及其局部环境（如附近硅羟基的存在）的作用，为合理设计催化剂提供了见解，可能导致更高效的ODHP催化剂。

这些发现强调了在催化剂开发中考虑表面和气相过程的重要性，以及调整活性位点配位环境以优化性能的潜力。这种对ODHP催化剂的多维理解和设计方法可能导致该领域的重大进展，并有望在页岩气制丙烯方面实现规模化应用。
