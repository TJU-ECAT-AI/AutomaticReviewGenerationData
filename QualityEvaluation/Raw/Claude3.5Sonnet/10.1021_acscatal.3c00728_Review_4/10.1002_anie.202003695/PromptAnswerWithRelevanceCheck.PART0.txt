The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. This synergistic effect between surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contributes to the exceptional performance of boron-based catalysts.

The mechanism involves surface-mediated formation of radicals on metastable sites, followed by their propagation in the gas phase. This combination explains the observed product distribution and catalytic performance across various oxygen partial pressures. The interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for a more accurate prediction of catalyst behavior compared to previous models.

The implications for catalyst performance and design optimization are significant:

1. Surface species that initiate oxidation while favoring i-propyl radical formation can enhance ODH performance.

2. Optimal catalysts should generate reactive H-abstracting species that preferentially target secondary CH bonds in propane.

3. Catalysts should minimize strong interactions with intermediates and products to avoid fast consecutive surface oxidation steps.

4. The balance between surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions can be tuned to optimize selectivity and activity.

5. Consideration of void space in catalyst beds and development of catalysts that generate HOO. radicals rather than alkyl radicals may provide additional benefits.

This multidimensional understanding allows for more targeted catalyst design, potentially leading to improved selectivity, activity, and overall performance in ODHP reactions. It also highlights the importance of considering both surface and gas-phase chemistry when developing and optimizing catalysts for complex reactions like ODH.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. This synergistic effect between surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contributes significantly to catalyst performance and offers insights for design optimization.

The mechanism combines surface-mediated formation of radicals on metastable sites with their subsequent propagation in the gas phase. This dual nature explains the remarkable product distribution observed in B-based catalysts. The interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for better control over the reaction pathways, particularly in terms of dehydrogenation versus C-C bond cleavage, which is influenced by oxygen concentration.

This comprehensive model can predict the experimentally observed product distribution over a range of oxygen partial pressures, which was not possible with previous mechanistic hypotheses. It highlights the critical role of free-radical gas-phase chemistry alongside surface-mediated reactions in determining catalyst performance.

The implications for catalyst performance and design optimization are significant. The model suggests that optimal catalysts should generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary C-H bonds in propane, while minimizing strong interactions with intermediates and products to prevent rapid consecutive surface oxidation steps. Additionally, surface species that can initiate oxidation while favoring i-propyl radical formation are hypothesized to lead to enhanced ODH performance.

This understanding opens up new avenues for catalyst design, such as optimizing the void space in a catalyst bed or developing catalysts that preferentially generate HOO· radicals rather than alkyl radicals. By leveraging the synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions, it may be possible to further improve selectivity and efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，为整体反应网络提供了全面的理解。表面介导和气相反应之间的协同效应对催化剂性能有显著贡献，并为设计优化提供了见解。

该机制结合了在亚稳态位点上表面介导的自由基形成与其在气相中的后续传播。这种双重性质解释了在B基催化剂中观察到的显著产品分布。表面和气相反应之间的相互作用允许更好地控制反应途径，特别是在脱氢与C-C键断裂之间的平衡，这受氧气浓度的影响。

这个综合模型能够在一系列氧分压下预测实验观察到的产品分布，这是之前的机理假说所无法做到的。它强调了自由基气相化学与表面介导反应在决定催化剂性能中的关键作用。

对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响是显著的。该模型表明，最佳催化剂应生成有利于丙烷中仲C-H键断裂的活性H-抽取物种，同时最小化与中间体和产物的强相互作用，以防止快速连续的表面氧化步骤。此外，可以启动氧化同时有利于i-丙基自由基形成的表面物种被假设可以导致增强的ODH性能。

这种理解为催化剂设计开辟了新途径，例如优化催化剂床的空隙空间或开发优先生成HOO·自由基而不是烷基自由基的催化剂。通过利用表面和气相反应之间的协同作用，可能进一步提高氧化脱氢过程的选择性和效率。

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complex interplay between surface-mediated reactions and gas-phase chemistry explains several key aspects of catalyst performance:

1. Product distribution: The remarkable selectivity is attributed to the formation of radicals on metastable surface sites, followed by their propagation in the gas phase. This mechanism allows for better control over the reaction pathways compared to purely surface-catalyzed reactions.

2. Oxygen concentration effects: The balance between dehydrogenation and C-C bond cleavage is controlled by oxygen concentration, highlighting the importance of gas-phase radical chemistry in determining product selectivity.

3. Performance explanation: The combined surface and gas-phase reaction network provides a comprehensive framework for explaining catalyst performance, accounting for both the initiation of reactions on the catalyst surface and their propagation in the gas phase.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have several implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Radical distribution: Optimizing the balance between surface-generated and gas-phase radicals can lead to improved selectivity towards desired products.

2. Surface site design: Developing catalysts with metastable surface sites that favor the formation of specific radicals (e.g., i-propyl) can enhance ODH performance.

3. Reactor engineering: Consideration of void space in catalyst beds becomes crucial, as it affects the extent of gas-phase reactions and overall catalyst performance.

4. Catalyst functionality: Designing catalysts that can generate specific radical species (e.g., HOO• radicals) rather than alkyl radicals may provide additional benefits in ODH reactions.

5. Process optimization: Understanding the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for better control of reaction conditions to maximize selectivity and yield.

This multidimensional understanding of the reaction mechanism provides a foundation for developing more efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP and similar oxidation reactions.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. This synergistic effect between surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contributes to the remarkable product distribution observed in B-based catalysts.

The surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites initiates the reaction, while the sequential propagation occurs in the gas phase. This combination allows for better control over the reaction pathways, particularly the balance between dehydrogenation and C-C bond cleavage, which is influenced by oxygen concentration.

The interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions has several implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. It explains the unique selectivity patterns observed in B-based catalysts, which differ from traditional vanadium-based catalysts.

2. It suggests that optimizing both the surface properties and the void space in the catalyst bed can lead to improved performance.

3. It highlights the importance of developing catalysts that can generate specific types of radicals (e.g., HOO• radicals) to enhance selectivity.

4. It emphasizes the need for surface species that favor the formation of i-propyl radicals over n-propyl radicals to minimize undesired side reactions.

5. It indicates that optimal ODH catalysts should generate reactive H-abstracting species that preferentially target secondary C-H bonds in propane.

6. It suggests that catalysts should have weak interactions with intermediates and products to prevent fast consecutive surface oxidation steps.

Understanding this multidimensional mechanism allows for more targeted catalyst design, focusing on both the surface properties and the gas-phase reaction environment. This approach can lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for the ODHP reaction.
