[1] "We argue that the remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase."

[2] "Beyond surface speciation, there are observations from catalytic studies that require complementary investigation. Reaction kinetic studies have shown that the predominance of dehydrogenation versus CC bond cleavagethe most important side-reactionis controlled by the oxygen concentration."

[3] "Our proposed reaction mechanism (simplified schematic depicted in Figure10) clearly highlights the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry as well as surface-mediated reactions in explaining catalyst performance."

[4] "From a catalytic materials perspective, we hypothesize that surface species that can initiate oxidation while also favoring i-propyl radical formation would lead to enhanced ODH performance."

[5] "We conclude that optimal ODH catalysts should 1)generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane, and 2)not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. This synergistic effect between surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contributes to the remarkable product distribution observed in B-based catalysts.

The surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites initiates the reaction, while the sequential propagation occurs in the gas phase. This combination allows for better control over the reaction pathways, particularly the balance between dehydrogenation and C-C bond cleavage, which is influenced by oxygen concentration.

The interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions has several implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. It explains the unique selectivity patterns observed in B-based catalysts, which differ from traditional vanadium-based catalysts.

2. It suggests that optimizing both the surface properties and the void space in the catalyst bed can lead to improved performance.

3. It highlights the importance of developing catalysts that can generate specific types of radicals (e.g., HOO• radicals) to enhance selectivity.

4. It emphasizes the need for surface species that favor the formation of i-propyl radicals over n-propyl radicals to minimize undesired side reactions.

5. It indicates that optimal ODH catalysts should generate reactive H-abstracting species that preferentially target secondary C-H bonds in propane.

6. It suggests that catalysts should have weak interactions with intermediates and products to prevent fast consecutive surface oxidation steps.

Understanding this multidimensional mechanism allows for more targeted catalyst design, focusing on both the surface properties and the gas-phase reaction environment. This approach can lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

基于硼的催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，为整体反应网络提供了全面的理解。表面介导和气相反应之间的协同效应有助于解释在基于硼的催化剂中观察到的显著产物分布。

在亚稳定位点上表面介导的自由基形成启动反应，而随后的传播发生在气相中。这种组合可以更好地控制反应途径，特别是脱氢和C-C键断裂之间的平衡，这受氧气浓度的影响。
