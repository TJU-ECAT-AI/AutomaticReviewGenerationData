[1] "We argue that the remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase."

[2] "Beyond surface speciation, there are observations from catalytic studies that require complementary investigation. Reaction kinetic studies have shown that the predominance of dehydrogenation versus CC bond cleavagethe most important side-reactionis controlled by the oxygen concentration."

[3] "Our proposed reaction mechanism (simplified schematic depicted in Figure10) clearly highlights the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry as well as surface-mediated reactions in explaining catalyst performance."

[4] "This simple model is, to our knowledge, the first mechanistic hypothesis that can predict the experimentally observed product distribution of BOx-catalyzed ODH over a range of oxygen partial pressures."

[5] "From a catalytic materials perspective, we hypothesize that surface species that can initiate oxidation while also favoring i-propyl radical formation would lead to enhanced ODH performance."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. This synergistic effect between surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contributes significantly to catalyst performance and offers insights for design optimization.

The mechanism combines surface-mediated formation of radicals on metastable sites with their subsequent propagation in the gas phase. This dual nature explains the remarkable product distribution observed in B-based catalysts. The interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for better control over the reaction pathways, particularly in terms of dehydrogenation versus C-C bond cleavage, which is influenced by oxygen concentration.

This comprehensive model can predict the experimentally observed product distribution over a range of oxygen partial pressures, which was not possible with previous mechanistic hypotheses. It highlights the critical role of free-radical gas-phase chemistry alongside surface-mediated reactions in determining catalyst performance.

The implications for catalyst performance and design optimization are significant. The model suggests that optimal catalysts should generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary C-H bonds in propane, while minimizing strong interactions with intermediates and products to prevent rapid consecutive surface oxidation steps. Additionally, surface species that can initiate oxidation while favoring i-propyl radical formation are hypothesized to lead to enhanced ODH performance.

This understanding opens up new avenues for catalyst design, such as optimizing the void space in a catalyst bed or developing catalysts that preferentially generate HOO· radicals rather than alkyl radicals. By leveraging the synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions, it may be possible to further improve selectivity and efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，为整体反应网络提供了全面的理解。表面介导和气相反应之间的协同效应对催化剂性能有显著贡献，并为设计优化提供了见解。

该机制结合了在亚稳态位点上表面介导的自由基形成与其在气相中的后续传播。这种双重性质解释了在B基催化剂中观察到的显著产品分布。表面和气相反应之间的相互作用允许更好地控制反应途径，特别是在脱氢与C-C键断裂之间的平衡，这受氧气浓度的影响。

这个综合模型能够在一系列氧分压下预测实验观察到的产品分布，这是之前的机理假说所无法做到的。它强调了自由基气相化学与表面介导反应在决定催化剂性能中的关键作用。

对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响是显著的。该模型表明，最佳催化剂应生成有利于丙烷中仲C-H键断裂的活性H-抽取物种，同时最小化与中间体和产物的强相互作用，以防止快速连续的表面氧化步骤。此外，可以启动氧化同时有利于i-丙基自由基形成的表面物种被假设可以导致增强的ODH性能。

这种理解为催化剂设计开辟了新途径，例如优化催化剂床的空隙空间或开发优先生成HOO·自由基而不是烷基自由基的催化剂。通过利用表面和气相反应之间的协同作用，可能进一步提高氧化脱氢过程的选择性和效率。
