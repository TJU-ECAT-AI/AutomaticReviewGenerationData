[1] "We argue that the remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase."

[2] "Beyond surface speciation, there are observations from catalytic studies that require complementary investigation. Reaction kinetic studies have shown that the predominance of dehydrogenation versus CC bond cleavagethe most important side-reactionis controlled by the oxygen concentration."

[3] "Our proposed reaction mechanism (simplified schematic depicted in Figure10) clearly highlights the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry as well as surface-mediated reactions in explaining catalyst performance."

[4] "From a catalytic materials perspective, we hypothesize that surface species that can initiate oxidation while also favoring i-propyl radical formation would lead to enhanced ODH performance."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complex interplay between surface-mediated reactions and gas-phase chemistry explains several key aspects of catalyst performance:

1. Product distribution: The remarkable selectivity is attributed to the formation of radicals on metastable surface sites, followed by their propagation in the gas phase. This mechanism allows for better control over the reaction pathways compared to purely surface-catalyzed reactions.

2. Oxygen concentration effects: The balance between dehydrogenation and C-C bond cleavage is controlled by oxygen concentration, highlighting the importance of gas-phase radical chemistry in determining product selectivity.

3. Performance explanation: The combined surface and gas-phase reaction network provides a comprehensive framework for explaining catalyst performance, accounting for both the initiation of reactions on the catalyst surface and their propagation in the gas phase.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have several implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Radical distribution: Optimizing the balance between surface-generated and gas-phase radicals can lead to improved selectivity towards desired products.

2. Surface site design: Developing catalysts with metastable surface sites that favor the formation of specific radicals (e.g., i-propyl) can enhance ODH performance.

3. Reactor engineering: Consideration of void space in catalyst beds becomes crucial, as it affects the extent of gas-phase reactions and overall catalyst performance.

4. Catalyst functionality: Designing catalysts that can generate specific radical species (e.g., HOO• radicals) rather than alkyl radicals may provide additional benefits in ODH reactions.

5. Process optimization: Understanding the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for better control of reaction conditions to maximize selectivity and yield.

This multidimensional understanding of the reaction mechanism provides a foundation for developing more efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP and similar oxidation reactions.

基于硼的催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，对我们理解整体反应网络做出了重要贡献。表面介导反应和气相化学之间的这种复杂相互作用解释了催化剂性能的几个关键方面：

1. 产物分布：显著的选择性归因于亚稳表面位点上自由基的形成，随后在气相中传播。与纯表面催化反应相比，这种机制可以更好地控制反应途径。

2. 氧气浓度效应：脱氢和C-C键断裂之间的平衡受氧气浓度控制，突显了气相自由基化学在决定产物选择性方面的重要性。

3. 性能解释：结合表面和气相反应网络为解释催化剂性能提供了全面的框架，解释了反应在催化剂表面的启动和在气相中的传播。

表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有几个影响：

1. 自由基分布：优化表面生成和气相自由基之间的平衡可以提高对目标产物的选择性。

2. 表面位点设计：开发具有有利于形成特定自由基（如异丙基）的亚稳表面位点的催化剂可以增强ODH性能。

3. 反应器工程：考虑催化剂床中的空隙空间变得至关重要，因为它影响气相反应的程度和整体催化剂性能。

4. 催化剂功能：设计能够生成特定自由基物种（如HOO•自由基）而不是烷基自由基的催化剂可能在ODH反应中提供额外的优势。

5. 过程优化：了解表面和气相反应之间的相互作用允许更好地控制反应条件，以最大化选择性和产率。

这种对反应机理的多维理解为开发更高效、更具选择性的ODHP和类似氧化反应的催化剂提供了基础。
