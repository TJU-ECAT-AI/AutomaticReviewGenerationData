[1] "We argue that the remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase."

[2] "Our proposed reaction mechanism (simplified schematic depicted in Figure10) clearly highlights the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry as well as surface-mediated reactions in explaining catalyst performance."

[3] "This simple model is, to our knowledge, the first mechanistic hypothesis that can predict the experimentally observed product distribution of BOx-catalyzed ODH over a range of oxygen partial pressures."

[4] "From a catalytic materials perspective, we hypothesize that surface species that can initiate oxidation while also favoring i-propyl radical formation would lead to enhanced ODH performance."

[5] "We conclude that optimal ODH catalysts should 1)generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane, and 2)not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. This synergistic effect between surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contributes to the exceptional performance of boron-based catalysts.

The mechanism involves surface-mediated formation of radicals on metastable sites, followed by their propagation in the gas phase. This combination explains the observed product distribution and catalytic performance across various oxygen partial pressures. The interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for a more accurate prediction of catalyst behavior compared to previous models.

The implications for catalyst performance and design optimization are significant:

1. Surface species that initiate oxidation while favoring i-propyl radical formation can enhance ODH performance.

2. Optimal catalysts should generate reactive H-abstracting species that preferentially target secondary CH bonds in propane.

3. Catalysts should minimize strong interactions with intermediates and products to avoid fast consecutive surface oxidation steps.

4. The balance between surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions can be tuned to optimize selectivity and activity.

5. Consideration of void space in catalyst beds and development of catalysts that generate HOO. radicals rather than alkyl radicals may provide additional benefits.

This multidimensional understanding allows for more targeted catalyst design, potentially leading to improved selectivity, activity, and overall performance in ODHP reactions. It also highlights the importance of considering both surface and gas-phase chemistry when developing and optimizing catalysts for complex reactions like ODH.

基于B的催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，为整体反应网络提供了全面的理解。表面介导反应和气相反应之间的协同效应有助于解释硼基催化剂的卓越性能。

该机理涉及在亚稳态位点上表面介导的自由基形成，随后在气相中传播。这种组合解释了在各种氧分压下观察到的产物分布和催化性能。表面和气相反应之间的相互作用使得与先前模型相比，能够更准确地预测催化剂行为。

对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响是显著的：

1. 在引发氧化的同时有利于i-丙基自由基形成的表面物种可以提高ODH性能。

2. 最佳催化剂应产生反应性H-抽取物种，优先针对丙烷中的仲CH键。

3. 催化剂应最小化与中间体和产物的强相互作用，以避免快速连续的表面氧化步骤。

4. 可以调节表面介导反应和气相反应之间的平衡，以优化选择性和活性。

5. 考虑催化剂床的空隙空间，以及开发产生HOO.自由基而非烷基自由基的催化剂，可能会带来额外的好处。

这种多维理解允许更有针对性的催化剂设计，可能导致ODHP反应中选择性、活性和整体性能的改善。它还强调了在开发和优化复杂反应（如ODH）的催化剂时，考虑表面和气相化学的重要性。
