[1] "We combine catalytic activity measurements with quantum chemical calculations to put forward a bold new hypothesis. We argue that the remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase."

[2] "Beyond surface speciation, there are observations from catalytic studies that require complementary investigation. Reaction kinetic studies have shown that the predominance of dehydrogenation versus CC bond cleavagethe most important side-reactionis controlled by the oxygen concentration."

[3] "This simple model is, to our knowledge, the first mechanistic hypothesis that can predict the experimentally observed product distribution of BOx-catalyzed ODH over a range of oxygen partial pressures."

[4] "From a catalytic materials perspective, we hypothesize that surface species that can initiate oxidation while also favoring i-propyl radical formation would lead to enhanced ODH performance."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This combined approach provides a more comprehensive explanation for the observed catalytic behavior and product distribution.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have several implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Product distribution control: The interplay between surface-mediated radical formation and gas-phase propagation allows for better control of the product distribution, particularly the balance between dehydrogenation and C-C bond cleavage.

2. Oxygen concentration effects: The mechanism explains how oxygen concentration influences the selectivity towards desired products, providing a basis for optimizing reaction conditions.

3. Predictive capability: The proposed model can predict product distribution across a range of oxygen partial pressures, offering a powerful tool for process optimization.

4. Catalyst design insights: Understanding the role of surface species in initiating oxidation and favoring specific radical formation (e.g., i-propyl radicals) provides direction for designing more effective catalysts.

5. Optimization of catalyst bed design: The recognition of the importance of gas-phase reactions suggests that optimizing void space in the catalyst bed could enhance performance.

6. Radical management: The mechanism highlights the importance of controlling radical species for selectivity, indicating that catalysts capable of generating specific radicals (e.g., HOO·) may offer improved performance.

These insights open new avenues for catalyst development and process optimization in ODHP reactions, potentially leading to more efficient and selective catalytic systems.
