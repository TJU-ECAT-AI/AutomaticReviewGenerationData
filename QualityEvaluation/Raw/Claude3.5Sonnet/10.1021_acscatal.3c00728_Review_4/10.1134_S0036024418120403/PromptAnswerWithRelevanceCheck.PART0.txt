Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or the synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase radical reactions. The text primarily focuses on CrOx/SiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2, and does not mention boron-based catalysts or discuss detailed reaction mechanisms. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质或表面和气相自由基反应的协同效应的信息。该文本主要侧重于CrOx/SiO2催化剂在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢,并没有提到硼基催化剂或讨论详细的反应机理。因此,无法根据提供的文档回答这个问题。
