[1] "We hypothesize that hBN activates oxygen and forms surface oxygen species responsible for selective alkane oxidation."

[2] "Buyevskaya et al. carried out Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) experiments to determine the mechanism of propane and oxygen activation in B2O3/Al2O3. The study demonstrated that BOx surface species hinder the H/D exchange between the surface and C3D8 as well as the formation of 18O16O isotopologues."

[3] "The authors proposed a mechanism involving propyl radical formation on the catalyst surface and continuation of the reaction in the gas phase via alkyl hydroperoxides. While gas phase peroxide and radical decomposition mechanisms are common in combustion and methane conversion literature, further investigations on their role during ODH chemistry will be needed, particularly in the context of high olefin selectivities of B-based catalysts."

[4] "Furthermore, the role of gas phase chemistry must be established and its importance on the observed ODH activity under various conditions considered in future model development."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complexity highlights the interplay between heterogeneous catalysis on the boron-based surface and homogeneous gas-phase chemistry.

The surface reactions likely involve the activation of oxygen to form selective oxygen species, as well as the initial activation of the alkane. The formation of propyl radicals on the catalyst surface appears to be a key step. However, the reaction doesn't end there - these activated species can then participate in gas-phase reactions, potentially involving alkyl hydroperoxides.

This synergy between surface and gas-phase chemistry has important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. It suggests that catalyst design should focus not only on optimizing surface properties but also on how these properties influence subsequent gas-phase reactions.

2. The high olefin selectivities observed with B-based catalysts might be a result of this unique interplay, where the surface chemistry initiates the reaction in a selective manner, and the gas-phase chemistry completes it without significant overoxidation.

3. Understanding this multidimensional mechanism is crucial for developing accurate kinetic models, which are essential for reactor design and process optimization.

4. It highlights the need for in-situ and operando characterization techniques that can probe both surface species and gas-phase intermediates under reaction conditions.

5. The role of catalyst porosity and reactor design becomes more critical, as they influence the residence time and interaction of gas-phase species.

Future research should focus on elucidating the exact nature of the surface-activated species, the mechanisms of their formation, and how they influence subsequent gas-phase chemistry. This comprehensive understanding will be key to designing more efficient and selective B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions.

基于硼的催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，对我们理解整体反应网络做出了重要贡献。这种复杂性突出了硼基表面上的多相催化作用与均相气相化学之间的相互作用。

表面反应可能涉及氧的活化以形成选择性氧物种，以及烷烃的初始活化。在催化剂表面形成丙基自由基似乎是一个关键步骤。然而，反应并不止于此 - 这些活化的物种随后可以参与气相反应，可能涉及烷基氢过氧化物。

表面和气相化学之间的这种协同作用对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 它表明催化剂设计应该不仅关注优化表面性质，还应关注这些性质如何影响后续的气相反应。

2. 硼基催化剂观察到的高烯烃选择性可能是这种独特相互作用的结果，其中表面化学以选择性方式启动反应，而气相化学在没有显著过度氧化的情况下完成反应。

3. 理解这种多维机理对于开发准确的动力学模型至关重要，这些模型对反应器设计和过程优化是必不可少的。

4. 它强调了需要原位和操作表征技术，这些技术可以在反应条件下探测表面物种和气相中间体。

5. 催化剂孔隙度和反应器设计的作用变得更加关键，因为它们影响气相物种的停留时间和相互作用。

未来的研究应该集中在阐明表面活化物种的确切性质、它们的形成机制以及它们如何影响后续的气相化学反应。这种全面的理解将是设计更高效、更选择性的ODHP反应硼基催化剂的关键。
