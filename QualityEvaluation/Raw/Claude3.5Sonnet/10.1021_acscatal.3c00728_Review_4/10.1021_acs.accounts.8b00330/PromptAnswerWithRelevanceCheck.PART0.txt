[1] "We hypothesize that hBN activates oxygen and forms surface oxygen species responsible for selective alkane oxidation."

[2] "Buyevskaya et al. carried out Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) experiments to determine the mechanism of propane and oxygen activation in B2O3/Al2O3. The study demonstrated that BOx surface species hinder the H/D exchange between the surface and C3D8 as well as the formation of 18O16O isotopologues. These TAP experiments led the authors to conclude that surface BOx suppresses dissociative adsorption of reactants and was the likely reason for high selectivities toward the olefin product."

[3] "The authors proposed a mechanism involving propyl radical formation on the catalyst surface and continuation of the reaction in the gas phase via alkyl hydroperoxides. While gas phase peroxide and radical decomposition mechanisms are common in combustion and methane conversion literature, further investigations on their role during ODH chemistry will be needed, particularly in the context of high olefin selectivities of B-based catalysts."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a complex picture of the overall reaction network. The surface reactions appear to involve the activation of oxygen to form selective oxygen species responsible for alkane oxidation. The BOx surface species seem to suppress dissociative adsorption of reactants, which may contribute to high olefin selectivity.

The proposed mechanism suggests that propyl radical formation occurs on the catalyst surface, followed by continuation of the reaction in the gas phase via alkyl hydroperoxides. This interplay between surface and gas-phase chemistry implies that the catalyst not only initiates the reaction but also influences the subsequent gas-phase radical reactions.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. Understanding this complex interplay could lead to the development of catalysts that better control the balance between surface activation and gas-phase propagation, potentially improving olefin selectivity and yield.

However, the account emphasizes that further investigations are needed to fully elucidate the role of gas-phase chemistry in the context of high olefin selectivities observed with B-based catalysts. This suggests that optimizing catalyst design may require a holistic approach that considers both surface properties and their influence on subsequent gas-phase reactions.

ODHP反应机理在B基催化剂上的多维性质，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，为整体反应网络提供了一个复杂的图景。表面反应似乎涉及氧的活化，形成负责烷烃氧化的选择性氧物种。BOx表面物种似乎抑制了反应物的解离吸附，这可能有助于高烯烃选择性。

提出的机制表明，丙基自由基的形成发生在催化剂表面，随后通过烷基氢过氧化物在气相中继续反应。表面和气相化学之间的这种相互作用意味着催化剂不仅启动反应，还影响随后的气相自由基反应。

表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响。理解这种复杂的相互作用可能导致开发出能更好地控制表面活化和气相传播之间平衡的催化剂，从而可能提高烯烃选择性和产率。

然而，该报告强调，需要进一步研究以充分阐明气相化学在B基催化剂观察到的高烯烃选择性背景下的作用。这表明优化催化剂设计可能需要一种整体方法，同时考虑表面性质及其对后续气相反应的影响。

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complexity highlights the interplay between heterogeneous catalysis on the boron-based surface and homogeneous gas-phase chemistry.

The surface reactions likely involve the activation of oxygen to form selective oxygen species, as well as the initial activation of the alkane. The formation of propyl radicals on the catalyst surface appears to be a key step. However, the reaction doesn't end there - these activated species can then participate in gas-phase reactions, potentially involving alkyl hydroperoxides.

This synergy between surface and gas-phase chemistry has important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. It suggests that catalyst design should focus not only on optimizing surface properties but also on how these properties influence subsequent gas-phase reactions.

2. The high olefin selectivities observed with B-based catalysts might be a result of this unique interplay, where the surface chemistry initiates the reaction in a selective manner, and the gas-phase chemistry completes it without significant overoxidation.

3. Understanding this multidimensional mechanism is crucial for developing accurate kinetic models, which are essential for reactor design and process optimization.

4. It highlights the need for in-situ and operando characterization techniques that can probe both surface species and gas-phase intermediates under reaction conditions.

5. The role of catalyst porosity and reactor design becomes more critical, as they influence the residence time and interaction of gas-phase species.

Future research should focus on elucidating the exact nature of the surface-activated species, the mechanisms of their formation, and how they influence subsequent gas-phase chemistry. This comprehensive understanding will be key to designing more efficient and selective B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions.

This complex interplay between surface and gas-phase chemistry has important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Catalyst design: Understanding the role of surface sites in generating reactive intermediates can guide the development of catalysts with optimal surface properties to promote selective reactions.

2. Reactor engineering: The presence of significant gas-phase chemistry may influence reactor design, potentially requiring considerations for gas-phase residence time and temperature profiles.

3. Kinetic modeling: Comprehensive kinetic models will need to incorporate both surface-catalyzed steps and gas-phase radical reactions, presenting a challenge but also an opportunity for more accurate performance predictions.

4. Selectivity control: The balance between surface and gas-phase reactions may be key to controlling product selectivity, offering new avenues for optimizing catalyst performance.

5. Operating conditions: The relative importance of surface vs. gas-phase reactions may vary with reaction conditions, suggesting that careful tuning of parameters like temperature and pressure could be used to maximize desired outcomes.

Further investigations into the specific roles of surface and gas-phase chemistry, as well as their synergistic effects, will be crucial for advancing the development and optimization of B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complexity highlights the intricate interplay between heterogeneous catalysis on the boron-based surface and homogeneous gas-phase chemistry.

The surface reactions likely involve the activation of oxygen to form selective oxidizing species, which then interact with alkanes. The formation of propyl radicals on the catalyst surface, as suggested by previous studies, initiates the dehydrogenation process. These surface reactions are crucial for the high selectivity observed in B-based catalysts, as the BOx species appear to suppress the dissociative adsorption of reactants, which could otherwise lead to overoxidation.

The gas-phase component of the reaction involves the continuation of the dehydrogenation process through alkyl hydroperoxides and other radical species. This step is critical for completing the formation of olefins and may contribute to the high selectivity observed in these systems.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Selectivity control: The interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for better control of product selectivity. By optimizing the surface properties of the B-based catalyst, it may be possible to fine-tune the balance between initial activation and subsequent gas-phase reactions, maximizing olefin yield.

2. Reaction pathway manipulation: Understanding the multidimensional nature of the reaction allows for the potential manipulation of reaction pathways. This could lead to the development of strategies to suppress undesired side reactions and enhance the desired olefin formation.

3. Catalyst design: The recognition of both surface and gas-phase components in the reaction mechanism provides new avenues for catalyst design. Future catalysts could be engineered to optimize not only surface properties but also to influence the gas-phase chemistry occurring near the catalyst surface.

4. Process optimization: The complex interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions may require a holistic approach to process optimization, considering factors such as reactor design, gas flow dynamics, and temperature profiles to maximize the synergistic effects of the multidimensional reaction network.

5. Mechanistic insights: The multidimensional nature of the reaction provides a more complete picture of the ODHP process, allowing for better predictive models and mechanistic understanding. This could lead to the development of more accurate kinetic models and improved catalyst characterization techniques.

In conclusion, recognizing and studying the multidimensional aspects of the ODHP reaction over B-based catalysts opens up new possibilities for catalyst design and process optimization. It underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to catalyst development that considers both surface chemistry and gas-phase reactions to achieve high performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The literature suggests that the reaction begins with the activation of oxygen on the catalyst surface, forming selective oxygen species responsible for alkane oxidation. The surface BOx species appear to suppress dissociative adsorption of reactants, which may be a key factor in achieving high olefin selectivities.

The proposed mechanism involves the formation of propyl radicals on the catalyst surface, followed by continuation of the reaction in the gas phase via alkyl hydroperoxides. This synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions could explain the unique selectivity patterns observed with B-based catalysts compared to traditional metal oxide catalysts.

The implications for catalyst performance and design optimization are significant. Understanding this multidimensional mechanism could lead to the development of catalysts that better balance surface reactivity with gas-phase radical chemistry. Optimizing the formation and distribution of BOx species on the catalyst surface could potentially enhance selectivity towards desired olefin products. Additionally, considering the role of gas-phase reactions in the overall mechanism could inform reactor design and operating conditions to maximize olefin yield.

However, the literature also emphasizes that further investigations are needed to fully elucidate the role of gas-phase chemistry in ODH reactions, particularly in relation to the high olefin selectivities observed with B-based catalysts. This highlights the complexity of the reaction network and the need for continued research to optimize catalyst performance and design.
