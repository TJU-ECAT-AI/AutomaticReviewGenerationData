[1] "We hypothesize that hBN activates oxygen and forms surface oxygen species responsible for selective alkane oxidation."

[2] "Buyevskaya et al. carried out Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) experiments to determine the mechanism of propane and oxygen activation in B2O3/Al2O3. The study demonstrated that BOx surface species hinder the H/D exchange between the surface and C3D8 as well as the formation of 18O16O isotopologues. These TAP experiments led the authors to conclude that surface BOx suppresses dissociative adsorption of reactants and was the likely reason for high selectivities toward the olefin product."

[3] "The authors proposed a mechanism involving propyl radical formation on the catalyst surface and continuation of the reaction in the gas phase via alkyl hydroperoxides. While gas phase peroxide and radical decomposition mechanisms are common in combustion and methane conversion literature, further investigations on their role during ODH chemistry will be needed, particularly in the context of high olefin selectivities of B-based catalysts."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a complex picture of the overall reaction network. The surface reactions appear to involve the activation of oxygen to form selective oxygen species responsible for alkane oxidation. The BOx surface species seem to suppress dissociative adsorption of reactants, which may contribute to high olefin selectivity.

The proposed mechanism suggests that propyl radical formation occurs on the catalyst surface, followed by continuation of the reaction in the gas phase via alkyl hydroperoxides. This interplay between surface and gas-phase chemistry implies that the catalyst not only initiates the reaction but also influences the subsequent gas-phase radical reactions.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. Understanding this complex interplay could lead to the development of catalysts that better control the balance between surface activation and gas-phase propagation, potentially improving olefin selectivity and yield.

However, the account emphasizes that further investigations are needed to fully elucidate the role of gas-phase chemistry in the context of high olefin selectivities observed with B-based catalysts. This suggests that optimizing catalyst design may require a holistic approach that considers both surface properties and their influence on subsequent gas-phase reactions.

ODHP反应机理在B基催化剂上的多维性质，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，为整体反应网络提供了一个复杂的图景。表面反应似乎涉及氧的活化，形成负责烷烃氧化的选择性氧物种。BOx表面物种似乎抑制了反应物的解离吸附，这可能有助于高烯烃选择性。

提出的机制表明，丙基自由基的形成发生在催化剂表面，随后通过烷基氢过氧化物在气相中继续反应。表面和气相化学之间的这种相互作用意味着催化剂不仅启动反应，还影响随后的气相自由基反应。

表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响。理解这种复杂的相互作用可能导致开发出能更好地控制表面活化和气相传播之间平衡的催化剂，从而可能提高烯烃选择性和产率。

然而，该报告强调，需要进一步研究以充分阐明气相化学在B基催化剂观察到的高烯烃选择性背景下的作用。这表明优化催化剂设计可能需要一种整体方法，同时考虑表面性质及其对后续气相反应的影响。
