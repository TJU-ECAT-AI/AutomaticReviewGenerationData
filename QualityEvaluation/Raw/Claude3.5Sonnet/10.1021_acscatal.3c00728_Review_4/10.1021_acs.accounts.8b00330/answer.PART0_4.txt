[1] "We hypothesize that hBN activates oxygen and forms surface oxygen species responsible for selective alkane oxidation."

[2] "Buyevskaya et al. carried out Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) experiments to determine the mechanism of propane and oxygen activation in B2O3/Al2O3. The study demonstrated that BOx surface species hinder the H/D exchange between the surface and C3D8 as well as the formation of 18O16O isotopologues. These TAP experiments led the authors to conclude that surface BOx suppresses dissociative adsorption of reactants and was the likely reason for high selectivities toward the olefin product."

[3] "The authors proposed a mechanism involving propyl radical formation on the catalyst surface and continuation of the reaction in the gas phase via alkyl hydroperoxides. While gas phase peroxide and radical decomposition mechanisms are common in combustion and methane conversion literature, further investigations on their role during ODH chemistry will be needed, particularly in the context of high olefin selectivities of B-based catalysts."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The literature suggests that the reaction begins with the activation of oxygen on the catalyst surface, forming selective oxygen species responsible for alkane oxidation. The surface BOx species appear to suppress dissociative adsorption of reactants, which may be a key factor in achieving high olefin selectivities.

The proposed mechanism involves the formation of propyl radicals on the catalyst surface, followed by continuation of the reaction in the gas phase via alkyl hydroperoxides. This synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions could explain the unique selectivity patterns observed with B-based catalysts compared to traditional metal oxide catalysts.

The implications for catalyst performance and design optimization are significant. Understanding this multidimensional mechanism could lead to the development of catalysts that better balance surface reactivity with gas-phase radical chemistry. Optimizing the formation and distribution of BOx species on the catalyst surface could potentially enhance selectivity towards desired olefin products. Additionally, considering the role of gas-phase reactions in the overall mechanism could inform reactor design and operating conditions to maximize olefin yield.

However, the literature also emphasizes that further investigations are needed to fully elucidate the role of gas-phase chemistry in ODH reactions, particularly in relation to the high olefin selectivities observed with B-based catalysts. This highlights the complexity of the reaction network and the need for continued research to optimize catalyst performance and design.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对我们理解整个反应网络做出了重要贡献。文献表明，反应始于催化剂表面的氧气活化，形成负责烷烃氧化的选择性氧物种。表面BOx物种似乎抑制了反应物的解离吸附，这可能是实现高烯烃选择性的关键因素。

提出的机理涉及在催化剂表面形成丙基自由基，然后通过烷基氢过氧化物在气相中继续反应。表面反应和气相反应之间的这种协同作用可能解释了B基催化剂与传统金属氧化物催化剂相比观察到的独特选择性模式。

这对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响是显著的。理解这种多维机理可能导致开发出更好地平衡表面反应性和气相自由基化学的催化剂。优化催化剂表面BOx物种的形成和分布可能会增强对所需烯烃产物的选择性。此外，考虑气相反应在整体机理中的作用可能会为反应器设计和操作条件提供信息，以最大化烯烃产率。

然而，文献也强调需要进一步研究以充分阐明气相化学在ODH反应中的作用，特别是在与B基催化剂观察到的高烯烃选择性相关的方面。这突出了反应网络的复杂性以及继续研究以优化催化剂性能和设计的必要性。
