[1] "The complexity of surfaces with a variety of terminations and bulk structures, let alone their modification by the chemical potential of a reaction mixture, makes heterogeneous catalyst discovery serendipitous in many cases."

[2] "We hypothesize that hBN activates oxygen and forms surface oxygen species responsible for selective alkane oxidation."

[3] "Buyevskaya et al. carried out Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) experiments to determine the mechanism of propane and oxygen activation in B2O3/Al2O3. The study demonstrated that BOx surface species hinder the H/D exchange between the surface and C3D8 as well as the formation of 18O16O isotopologues. These TAP experiments led the authors to conclude that surface BOx suppresses dissociative adsorption of reactants and was the likely reason for high selectivities toward the olefin product. The authors proposed a mechanism involving propyl radical formation on the catalyst surface and continuation of the reaction in the gas phase via alkyl hydroperoxides."

[4] "While gas phase peroxide and radical decomposition mechanisms are common in combustion and methane conversion literature, further investigations on their role during ODH chemistry will be needed, particularly in the context of high olefin selectivities of B-based catalysts."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complexity highlights the intricate interplay between heterogeneous catalysis on the boron-based surface and homogeneous gas-phase chemistry.

The surface reactions likely involve the activation of oxygen to form selective oxidizing species, which then interact with alkanes. The formation of propyl radicals on the catalyst surface, as suggested by previous studies, initiates the dehydrogenation process. These surface reactions are crucial for the high selectivity observed in B-based catalysts, as the BOx species appear to suppress the dissociative adsorption of reactants, which could otherwise lead to overoxidation.

The gas-phase component of the reaction involves the continuation of the dehydrogenation process through alkyl hydroperoxides and other radical species. This step is critical for completing the formation of olefins and may contribute to the high selectivity observed in these systems.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Selectivity control: The interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for better control of product selectivity. By optimizing the surface properties of the B-based catalyst, it may be possible to fine-tune the balance between initial activation and subsequent gas-phase reactions, maximizing olefin yield.

2. Reaction pathway manipulation: Understanding the multidimensional nature of the reaction allows for the potential manipulation of reaction pathways. This could lead to the development of strategies to suppress undesired side reactions and enhance the desired olefin formation.

3. Catalyst design: The recognition of both surface and gas-phase components in the reaction mechanism provides new avenues for catalyst design. Future catalysts could be engineered to optimize not only surface properties but also to influence the gas-phase chemistry occurring near the catalyst surface.

4. Process optimization: The complex interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions may require a holistic approach to process optimization, considering factors such as reactor design, gas flow dynamics, and temperature profiles to maximize the synergistic effects of the multidimensional reaction network.

5. Mechanistic insights: The multidimensional nature of the reaction provides a more complete picture of the ODHP process, allowing for better predictive models and mechanistic understanding. This could lead to the development of more accurate kinetic models and improved catalyst characterization techniques.

In conclusion, recognizing and studying the multidimensional aspects of the ODHP reaction over B-based catalysts opens up new possibilities for catalyst design and process optimization. It underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to catalyst development that considers both surface chemistry and gas-phase reactions to achieve high performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.
