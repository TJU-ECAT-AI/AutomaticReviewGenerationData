The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This dual-pathway mechanism reveals that the catalytic process is not limited to surface interactions but also extends into the gas phase, creating a more complex and synergistic system.

The recognition of gas-phase radical reactions as an important factor in the ODHP process has led to new insights into catalyst performance. For instance, the improvement of ODHP activity through gas-phase radical chemistry over VOx-modified BN catalysts demonstrates the potential for enhancing overall catalytic activity by leveraging both surface and gas-phase reactions.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates propane activation, resulting in a higher reaction order for propane. This, in turn, leads to enhanced catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

These findings suggest that future catalyst design should focus on optimizing both surface properties and the catalyst's ability to promote beneficial gas-phase reactions. This could involve developing catalysts with specific pore structures or surface chemistries that encourage the formation and propagation of gas-phase radicals while maintaining efficient surface-catalyzed pathways. By considering both aspects, researchers can potentially create more effective and selective catalysts for the ODHP process.
