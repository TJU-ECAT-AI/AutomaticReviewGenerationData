The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a more comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. This multifaceted approach reveals that the catalytic process is not limited to surface interactions alone, but also includes significant contributions from gas-phase reactions.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity: The combination of surface-catalyzed pathways and gas-phase radical reactions can lead to improved ODHP activity, as demonstrated by the VOx-modified BN catalyst.

2. Increased reaction order: The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates propane activation, resulting in a higher reaction order for propane. This can lead to enhanced catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

3. Catalyst design considerations: Understanding the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for more targeted catalyst design. For example, creating catalysts with highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions could be a feasible way to construct highly active and selective ODHP catalysts.

4. Improved selectivity: The synergistic effects can potentially lead to better control over product distribution, allowing for higher selectivity towards desired products like propylene.

5. Process optimization: Knowledge of the multidimensional reaction mechanism enables better optimization of reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios, to maximize the benefits of both surface and gas-phase reactions.

By considering both surface and gas-phase reactions, researchers can develop more efficient catalysts and reaction systems for the ODHP process, potentially leading to improved industrial applications for propylene production.

基于B的催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，为整体反应网络提供了更全面的理解。这种多方面的方法揭示了催化过程不仅限于表面相互作用，还包括气相反应的重要贡献。

表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 增强催化活性：表面催化途径和气相自由基反应的组合可以提高ODHP活性，如VOx修饰的BN催化剂所证明的那样。

2. 提高反应级数：气相反应贡献的增强促进了丙烷的活化，导致丙烷的反应级数更高。这可以提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面的催化性能。

3. 催化剂设计考虑：理解表面和气相反应之间的相互作用允许更有针对性的催化剂设计。例如，创建具有高度暴露的活性硼中心和增强的气相反应的催化剂可能是构建高活性和高选择性ODHP催化剂的可行方法。

4. 提高选择性：协同效应可能导致对产物分布的更好控制，允许对所需产物（如丙烯）具有更高的选择性。

5. 过程优化：了解多维反应机理使得能够更好地优化反应条件，如温度、压力和反应物比例，以最大化表面和气相反应的益处。

通过同时考虑表面和气相反应，研究人员可以为ODHP过程开发更高效的催化剂和反应系统，潜在地改进丙烯生产的工业应用。
