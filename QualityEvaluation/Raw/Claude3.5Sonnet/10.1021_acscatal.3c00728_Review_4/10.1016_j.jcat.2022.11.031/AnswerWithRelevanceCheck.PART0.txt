          [1] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity"

[2] "Wu lately reported the improvement of ODHP activity via the gas-phase radical chemistry over VOx-modified BN catalyst, evidenced by the formation of NO according to the observation of synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS)"

[3] "The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, consequently resulting in higher reaction order of propane. It enables the enhanced catalytic performance of embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalyst in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity."

[4] "Combined with kinetic measurements, the reaction in the gas phase initiated by the active boron sites is mainly responsible for the high catalytic performance in ODH of propane reaction."

[5] "Structure characterizations and kinetic measurements revealed that the H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species were responsible for activating propane on the catalysts surface and gas phase, and the reactions in the gas phase were mainly responsible for the high performance in ODHP reaction."

          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This dual-pathway mechanism reveals that the catalytic process is not limited to surface interactions but extends into the gas phase, creating a more complex and synergistic system.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have several important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity: The combination of surface-catalyzed pathways and gas-phase radical reactions leads to improved ODHP activity, as demonstrated by the VOx-modified BN catalyst.

2. Improved propane activation: The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates propane activation, resulting in a higher reaction order for propane. This leads to enhanced catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

3. Catalyst design considerations: Understanding the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for more targeted catalyst design. For example, creating catalysts with highly exposed active boron centers and structures that promote gas-phase reactions could lead to more effective ODHP catalysts.

4. Reaction mechanism insights: The multidimensional nature of the reaction provides a more comprehensive understanding of the ODHP process. For instance, H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species are responsible for activating propane on both the catalyst surface and in the gas phase.

5. Performance attribution: Gas-phase reactions initiated by active boron sites are primarily responsible for the high catalytic performance in the ODH of propane reaction.

This multidimensional understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism opens up new avenues for catalyst development and process optimization. By considering both surface and gas-phase reactions, researchers can potentially create more efficient and selective catalysts for propylene production, optimize reaction conditions, and improve reactor designs to maximize the benefits of both reaction pathways.

          B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，显著增进了我们对整体反应网络的理解。这种双路径机制揭示了催化过程不仅限于表面相互作用，还延伸到气相，形成了一个更复杂和协同的系统。

表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有几个重要影响：

1. 增强催化活性：表面催化途径和气相自由基反应的结合导致ODHP活性的提高，如VOx修饰的BN催化剂所证明的那样。

2. 改善丙烷活化：气相反应贡献的增强促进了丙烷的活化，导致丙烷反应级数提高。这使得催化性能在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面得到提升。

3. 催化剂设计考虑：理解表面和气相反应之间的相互作用允许更有针对性的催化剂设计。例如，创建具有高度暴露的活性硼中心和促进气相反应的结构可能会导致更有效的ODHP催化剂。

4. 反应机理洞察：反应的多维性质提供了对ODHP过程更全面的理解。例如，缺陷三配位硼物种中的氢键BOH基团负责在催化剂表面和气相中活化丙烷。

5. 性能归因：由活性硼位点引发的气相反应主要负责丙烷ODH反应中的高催化性能。

这种对ODHP反应机理的多维理解为催化剂开发和过程优化开辟了新的途径。通过同时考虑表面和气相反应，研究人员可能创造出更高效和选择性的丙烯生产催化剂，优化反应条件，并改进反应器设计以最大化两种反应途径的益处。
