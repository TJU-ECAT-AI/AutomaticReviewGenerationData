The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This dual-pathway mechanism reveals that the catalytic process is not limited to surface interactions but also extends into the gas phase, creating a more complex and synergistic system.

The recognition of gas-phase radical reactions as an important factor in the ODHP process has led to new insights into catalyst performance. For instance, the improvement of ODHP activity through gas-phase radical chemistry over VOx-modified BN catalysts demonstrates the potential for enhancing overall catalytic activity by leveraging both surface and gas-phase reactions.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates propane activation, resulting in a higher reaction order for propane. This, in turn, leads to enhanced catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

These findings suggest that future catalyst design should focus on optimizing both surface properties and the catalyst's ability to promote beneficial gas-phase reactions. This could involve developing catalysts with specific pore structures or surface chemistries that encourage the formation and propagation of gas-phase radicals while maintaining efficient surface-catalyzed pathways. By considering both aspects, researchers can potentially create more effective and selective catalysts for the ODHP process.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，显著增进了我们对整体反应网络的理解。这种双路径机制揭示了催化过程不仅限于表面相互作用，还延伸到气相，形成了一个更复杂和协同的系统。

认识到气相自由基反应是ODHP过程中的一个重要因素，为催化剂性能带来了新的见解。例如，通过VOx改性BN催化剂上的气相自由基化学提高ODHP活性，展示了通过利用表面和气相反应来增强整体催化活性的潜力。

表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响。气相反应的增强贡献促进了丙烷的活化，导致丙烷的反应级数更高。这反过来又导致了丙烷转化和丙烯选择性方面的催化性能提高。

这些发现表明，未来的催化剂设计应该注重优化表面性质和催化剂促进有益气相反应的能力。这可能涉及开发具有特定孔结构或表面化学性质的催化剂，以鼓励气相自由基的形成和传播，同时保持高效的表面催化途径。通过考虑这两个方面，研究人员可能会为ODHP过程创造出更有效和选择性的催化剂。
