[1] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity"

[2] "Wu lately reported the improvement of ODHP activity via the gas-phase radical chemistry over VOx-modified BN catalyst, evidenced by the formation of NO according to the observation of synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS)"

[3] "Combined with kinetic measurements, the reaction in the gas phase initiated by the active boron sites is mainly responsible for the high catalytic performance in ODH of propane reaction."

[4] "The designed experiment indicates the strengthened gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, consequently resulting in the increase of reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This dual-pathway mechanism reveals that the catalytic process is not limited to surface interactions alone, but also includes important gas-phase radical reactions that can substantially influence the overall catalytic activity.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have several implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity: The interplay between surface-catalyzed pathways and gas-phase radical reactions can lead to improved ODHP activity, as demonstrated by the VOx-modified BN catalyst.

2. Increased reaction order: The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates the activation of propane, resulting in a higher reaction order with respect to propane. This suggests that optimizing catalyst design to promote gas-phase reactions could lead to more efficient propane activation.

3. Improved propylene selectivity: The embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) catalyst, which leverages both surface and gas-phase reactions, shows enhanced propylene selectivity compared to conventional MFI-type borosilicate zeolite.

4. Catalyst design considerations: Understanding the multidimensional nature of the reaction mechanism allows for more targeted catalyst design. For example, creating catalysts with highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions could lead to improved ODHP performance.

5. Reaction engineering: The recognition of gas-phase radical reactions as an important factor in the ODHP process may influence reactor design and operating conditions to maximize the benefits of these reactions.

In conclusion, the multidimensional reaction mechanism provides a more comprehensive understanding of the ODHP process, enabling researchers to develop more effective catalysts and optimize reaction conditions for improved propylene production.
