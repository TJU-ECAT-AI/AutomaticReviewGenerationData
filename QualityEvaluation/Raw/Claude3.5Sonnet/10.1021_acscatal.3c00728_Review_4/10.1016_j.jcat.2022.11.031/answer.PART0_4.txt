[1] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity"

[2] "Wu lately reported the improvement of ODHP activity via the gas-phase radical chemistry over VOx-modified BN catalyst, evidenced by the formation of NO according to the observation of synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS)"

[3] "Structure characterizations and kinetic measurements revealed that the H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species were responsible for activating propane on the catalysts surface and gas phase, and the reactions in the gas phase were mainly responsible for the high performance in ODHP reaction."

[4] "The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, consequently resulting in higher reaction order of propane. It enables the enhanced catalytic performance of embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalyst in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This understanding reveals that the reaction process is more complex than previously thought, involving not just surface catalysis but also important gas-phase radical reactions.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have several implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity: The combination of surface-catalyzed pathways and gas-phase radical reactions can lead to improved ODHP activity, as demonstrated by the VOx-modified BN catalyst.

2. Increased propane activation: The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates propane activation, resulting in a higher reaction order for propane.

3. Improved propylene selectivity and conversion: The synergistic effects enable enhanced catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity, as observed in the embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalyst.

4. Design considerations: Understanding the multidimensional nature of the reaction mechanism allows for more targeted catalyst design. For example, creating catalysts with highly exposed active boron centers and structures that promote gas-phase reactions could lead to more effective ODHP catalysts.

5. Reaction environment optimization: Recognizing the importance of gas-phase reactions suggests that reactor design and reaction conditions should be optimized to take advantage of both surface and gas-phase pathways.

This multidimensional understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism opens up new avenues for catalyst development and process optimization, potentially leading to more efficient and selective propylene production methods.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性，包括表面和气相自由基反应，极大地促进了我们对整个反应网络的理解。这种理解揭示了反应过程比之前认为的更为复杂，不仅涉及表面催化，还包括重要的气相自由基反应。

表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有几个重要影响：

1. 增强催化活性：表面催化途径和气相自由基反应的结合可以提高ODHP活性，正如VOx修饰的BN催化剂所展示的那样。

2. 增加丙烷活化：气相反应贡献的增强促进了丙烷的活化，导致丙烷的反应级数更高。

3. 提高丙烯选择性和转化率：协同效应使得催化性能在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面得到提升，这在胚胎型硼硅分子筛催化剂中得到了观察。

4. 设计考虑：理解反应机理的多维性允许更有针对性的催化剂设计。例如，创造具有高度暴露的活性硼中心和促进气相反应的结构可能会导致更有效的ODHP催化剂。

5. 反应环境优化：认识到气相反应的重要性表明，反应器设计和反应条件应该被优化以利用表面和气相两种途径。

这种对ODHP反应机理的多维理解为催化剂开发和过程优化开辟了新的途径，可能导致更高效和选择性的丙烯生产方法。
