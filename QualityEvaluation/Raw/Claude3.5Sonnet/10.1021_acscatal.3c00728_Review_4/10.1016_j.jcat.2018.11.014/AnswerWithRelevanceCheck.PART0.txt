          [1] "Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2"

[2] "Hermans and co-workers proposed that BOON, later on boron oxygen species were responsible for high activity and olefins selectivity that were influenced by electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures."

[3] "Our previous work [12] demonstrated that the BOH sites initially reacted with molecular oxygen leading to the production of BOOB intermediates and further abstracted the hydrogen atoms from propane, forming C3H6 and H2O in the ODH of propane."

[4] "Besides, Zhou et al. [28] further proved that the BOH species can promote the adsorption of O2 through adsorption microcalorimetric experiments."

[5] "An 18O isotope tracer study verified that an oxygen exchange between the surface oxygen atoms in the BOH groups and molecular oxygen occurred in the reaction of ODH process at hydroxylated h-BN catalyst."

[6] "Huang et al. [18] also found that the atomic exchange between 16O2 and 18O2 in the reaction of ODH process at h-BN catalyst."

[7] "Kinetic experiments were performed to gain insights into the reaction pathway of light alkanes ODH over the silicon boride catalyst."

[8] "Moreover, the apparent activation energy (Ea, Fig. S10) were estimated to be 268kJmol1, 244kJmol1 and 160kJmol1 for ethane, propane and isobutane, respectively."

          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts involves complex interactions between surface and gas-phase reactions. The literature suggests that BOH sites on the catalyst surface play a crucial role in the reaction network:

1. Surface reactions:
   - BOH groups act as active sites, selectively breaking C-H bonds while preventing overoxidation to CO2.
   - BOH sites initially react with molecular oxygen to form BOOB intermediates.
   - These intermediates then abstract hydrogen atoms from alkanes (e.g., propane), producing olefins (e.g., propylene) and water.

2. Gas-phase interactions:
   - BOH species promote the adsorption of O2 on the catalyst surface.
   - Oxygen exchange occurs between surface oxygen atoms in BOH groups and gas-phase molecular oxygen.
   - Atomic exchange between different oxygen isotopes (16O2 and 18O2) has been observed during the ODH process.

3. Synergistic effects:
   - The interaction between surface BOH sites and gas-phase oxygen contributes to the overall reaction network and affects catalyst performance.
   - The dynamic nature of the catalyst surface during the reaction, as evidenced by oxygen exchange processes, influences its stability and long-term performance.

4. Reaction kinetics:
   - Kinetic experiments provide insights into the reaction pathway of light alkanes ODH over silicon boride catalysts.
   - Different activation energies for various alkanes (ethane, propane, isobutane) correspond to the strength of their weakest C-H bonds, implying that C-H bond cleavage is a key step in the reaction mechanism.

Implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Understanding the role of BOH sites and their interaction with gas-phase oxygen can guide the development of more efficient catalysts.
2. Optimizing the concentration and accessibility of active BOH sites may enhance the catalyst's ability to activate both alkanes and oxygen, potentially leading to improved selectivity and yield.
3. Controlling the formation and distribution of active BOH sites on the catalyst surface while considering their interactions with gas-phase species is crucial for catalyst design.
4. The multidimensional nature of the reaction mechanism underscores the importance of comprehensive characterization and in-situ studies to fully elucidate the reaction network and guide catalyst development.
5. Future research should focus on integrating surface science, spectroscopy, and kinetic studies to capture the full complexity of the ODHP process over B-based catalysts and further improve catalyst selectivity and efficiency.
