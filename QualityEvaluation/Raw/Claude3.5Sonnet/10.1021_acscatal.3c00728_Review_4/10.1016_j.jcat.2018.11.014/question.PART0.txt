Abstract
Due to the free coking and no equilibrium limitation in alkanes conversion, the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins offers an attractive route, but encounters the difficulty in selectivity control for olefins because of the over-oxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of CO2. Here we report silicon boride exhibiting good oxidation resistance property at high temperature, as a metal-free catalyst efficiently catalyzed dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins with a high selectivity at a given reaction conditions. The stability was evidenced by the operation of a 100-h test with steady conversion and product selectivity. When the conversion of ethane, propane and isobutane reached 18.8%, 19.1% and 6.0%, the selectivity of olefins were up to 98.0%, 94.4% and 96.4%, respectively. This work experimentally supports that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiate the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

1. Introduction
The heterogeneous oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes (C2C4) featured with free coking and no thermodynamic restriction is an attractive process to direct dehydrogenation, and usually catalysed by transition metal oxides and alkaline-earth metal oxychlorides

[2]

[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]

[6]
,
[7]
. Nevertheless, the uncontrollable over-oxidation of olefins caused the formation of significant amounts of CO2 (1060%)
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
,
[11]
,
[12]
, which made the metal oxides or oxychlorides catalysed ODH process is still far away in prospect of industrialization.
The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bond of alkanes by the metal-free catalyst
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
. It consequently expands the fundamental understanding of the industrially important ODH process. The catalyst h-BN can convert propane to propylene with a selectivity reaching 80%, more than 90% for both propylene and ethylene, with negligible CO2 formation (0.5%) at a given propane conversion of 20.6%
[14]
. Hermans and co-workers proposed that BOON
[13]
, later on boron oxygen species
[16]
were responsible for high activity and olefins selectivity that were influenced by electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures. Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2
[14]
,
[17]
. In the following up study, Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction. Recently
[18]
, we showed that boron nitride can also oxidize methane to valuable products
[19]
. Moreover, Xie and coworkers demonstrated that carbon-doped BN catalyst showed good activity in ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene
[20]
. Anyhow, people in different groups identified with the idea that the boron species could be truly indispensable element for high ODH activity.
Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for ODH of light alkanes. Study on the metal-free silicon boride may make a better understanding on the catalytic origin of the boron species, and further initiate the exploration of other new boron-based catalysts. Herein, we prepared an oxygenic groups functionalised silicon boride (main phase is SiB6,
Fig. S1
) for ODH of light alkanes. The functionalised silicon boride showed high ODH activity for light alkanes; more importantly, the antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensured the catalytic stability.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Silicon boride was purchased from Shanghai Lantian nanomaterial Co., Ltd.. Before using, the silicon boride was first impregnated with 4M NaOH aqueous solution at 50C for 24h, afterwards, the sample was washed by aqueous ammonia, followed extensive washing with ultrapure water, and then dried at 100C in air.
2.2. Catalytic evaluation
Catalytic reactions were performed in a packed-bed quartz microreactor (I.D.=6mm). The reaction mixture was alkanes/oxygen/nitrogen with a molar ratio of 1/1/4 for ethane, 1/1.5/3.5 for propane and 1/0.5/4.5 for isobutane at atmospheric pressure. The flow rate was fixed at 48mLmin1, and the reaction temperature was varied in the range of 450595C. SiC (β phase, 0.25mm-0.43mm) was used as the control sample for blank test and the results were showed in
Table S1
. Reactants and products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC 7900). A GDX-102 and 5A molecular sieve column, connected to a TCD and a Plot Al2O3/S column connected to an FID were used to analyze the O2, N2, i-C4H10, i-C4H8, C3H8, C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, CH4, CO, and CO2.
Conversion was defined as the number of moles of carbon converted divided by the number of moles of carbon present in the feed. Selectivity was defined as the number of moles of carbon in the product divided by the number of moles of carbon reacted. The turnover rate (TOR) was calculated based on the hypothesis that per boron atom generates one BOH in B2O3 and BxOy species. The quantity of BO species was calculated from the results of XPS and mass change of catalysts (before and after reaction) due to the oxidation of catalyst surfaces. The number of active sites were 8×103molBOHsiteg1cat. The carbon balance was checked by comparing the number of moles of carbon in the outlet stream to the number of moles of carbon in the feed. Under our typical evaluating conditions, the carbon balance was higher than 95%. To account for the volume expansion in the reaction, nitrogen was used as the internal standard.
In kinetic analysis, reaction rates were measured in a packed-bed single-pass flow microreactor with plug-flow hydrodynamics. Catalyst samples weighing were 0.10.2mg (0.250.43mm). Experimental data of alkanes and oxygen conversion at different temperature levels were used to obtain the apparent activation energy. Reaction orders of alkanes and oxygen were obtained by measuring the effect of reactant partial pressure on reaction rates. The catalytic reactions were not affected by mass or heat transport limitations (
Fig. S2
).
2.3. Catalyst characterization
XPS analysis was performed on an Omicron Sphera II hemispherical electron energy analyzer with an in-situ reaction cell attached to the instrument. Monochromatic ALK X-ray source (1486.6eV, anode operating at 15kV and 300W) was used as incident radiation. Before the measurements, all the samples were treated in situ at 500C for 1h under an Ar stream (32mLmin1) and then moved to the measured chamber under vacuum conditions.
Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured with a Tristar 3000 sorption analyzer (Micromeritics). BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface areas.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (
Fig. S3
) were recorded on a FEI TECNAI F30 microscope, operating at an accelerating voltage of 300kV. Scanning electron microscope-Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (SEM-EDS) investigations were carried out with a FEI Nova NanoSEM 450 instrument.
In situ X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were operated on a PANalytical X'Pert3 Powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15406nm). The tube voltage was 40kV, and the current was 40mA. The 150mg catalyst was loaded into the reactor chamber and heated in nitrogen at a rate of 10C/min to 535C under a flow of N2. Subsequently, the gas flow was switched to O2/N2 or C3H8/O2/N2 to determine the change occurred in different environment for catalyst. The flow rate was fixed as 48mL/min.
In situ DRIFT spectra were recorded under reaction condition on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. The 20mg silicon boride catalyst was loaded into the cell with a CaF2 window. Spectra were averaged over 256 scans in the range 4004000cm1 with a 2cm1 resolution. The gas composition at the reactor outlet during was controlled by online mass spectrometry (MS, Pfeiffer, OminStar). The m/z of 41 was used to analyze C3H6. The contribution of C3H8 for the m/z signal of 41 was deducted.
Isotope-labeling experiments were performed in a packed-bed single-pass flow microreactor. The chemical and isotopic compositions of the reactor effluent were measured by online mass spectrometry. In the deuterium-labeling studies, the silicon boride catalyst was initially treated at 535C under N2 (50mLmin1) for 2h, and then a 12h H/D exchange process on the catalyst surface was accomplished by passing a N2 feed (30mLmin1) through a water saturator held at 25C by a thermostat to produce a 3.5vol% D2O/N2 feed. Heavy water (D2O, Cambridge Isotope Lab., 99.9%) was not further purified. Subsequently, the catalyst was purged with the N2 (50mLmin1) for 3h to remove the excess D2O. A mixture of the two (800mL each time) was then directly pulsed into the catalyst using N2 (50mLmin1) as the carrier gas. The following mass-to-charge (m/z) signals were analyzed: 29 (C3H8), 41 (C3H6, C3H8), 18 (H2O), 19 (HDO), and 20 (D2O).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performance of silicon boride
Before using, the silicon boride was activated by feed gas (C3H8/O2/N2) at 535C for 3h (possible impurity elements were showed in
Table S2
). The activity of silicon boride catalyst in ODH of light alkanes including ethane, propane and isobutane was showed in
Fig. 1
. The first example is ODH of ethane. The TOR of ethane approached 1.3×103mols1molsite1 (
Table 1
) at 575C and the ethylene selectivity reached 95.8% with COx (4.2%) as byproduct. The superior catalytic selectivity is better than those of carbon-based catalysts
[21]
and many metal oxide catalysts
[22]
(
Fig. S4
). In another case of ODH of propane, the TOR was 9×104mols1molsite1 at 535C and the selectivity of propylene was 82.2%. Taking the valuable product ethylene into account, the selectivity of light olefins including ethylene and propylene reached 94.4%, superior to that over most metal oxide catalysts
[23]
,
[8]
, carbon materials
[24]
,
[25]
. In the case of ODH of isobutane, the TOR was 3×104mols1molsite1 at 490C and the 77.1% selectivity of isobutene (96.4% selectivity of olefins) was observed. The selectivity of olefins is better than most of other metal-based and carbon-based catalysts
[26]
,
[27]
(
Fig. S4
). The catalytic selectivity of silicon boride catalyst was also higher than most of other boron-containing catalysts
[16]
,
[18]
. The difference of selectivity between silicon boride with other boron-containing catalysts maybe resulted from the different subsurface structure
[16]
. In addition, light olefins productivities reported on most metal oxide catalysts and boron-based catalysts were lower than 1golefinsgcat1h1, unattractive for commercial application
[12]
,
[16]
. In our case, the light olefins productivity was 1.22.6golefinsgcat1h1, demonstrating a good activity of the silicon boride catalyst for catalytic production of light olefins. The stability of the silicon boride catalyst in the ODH of propane to propylene was evidenced by the operation of a 100-h test at 535C. No significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred (
Fig. 1
). It needed to note that the catalytic activity of silicon boride was increasing over time during the activation process (
Fig. S5
), as we observed in h-BN catalytic system
[14]
. More interestingly, the propane conversion rate of the catalyst activated in oxygen atmosphere (535C, 3h; the catalyst was defined as SiB-O2) was much lower than that activated under reaction conditions (
Table S3
).

3.2. The origin of catalytic activity
An introduction period was observed on silicon boride catalysts which was also found in h-BN catalyzing ODH reactions
[17]
,
[28]
. To better understand the activation and reaction process, XRD measurement was performed to trace the structure evolution of the silicon boride catalyst under different conditions, including heated to 535C, activated in oxygen or reaction atmosphere and then cooled to room temperature (
Fig. 2
a). When silicon boride catalyst was activated in the reaction atmosphere and then cooled down to room temperature, the characteristic peaks (marked by blue asterisks) associated with B2O3 phase were observed, which implied that the origin of the unanticipated catalytic activity might be attributed to the existence of B2O3 species. It must be pointed out that the B2O3 signal cannot be detected at 535C for the low melting point of B2O3. In contrast, the bulk phase structure of silicon boride remained unchanged in the oxygen atmosphere at any stages except for slight peak shifts due to a change in lattice parameters resulted from the thermal expansion, implying that the oxyfunctionalization of catalyst was facilitated under ODH reaction conditions. After being subjected to ODH reaction, the catalyst retained the bulk structure of silicon boride (
Fig. S1
), suggesting that the oxyfunctionalization may only occur on the surface of catalyst.

To further identify the active sites, the structure evolution of the silicon boride catalyst before and after activation was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The surface concentrations of boron, silicon and oxygen of a fresh catalyst were 37.7%, 20.5% and 41.8%, respectively (
Table S4
). In the B 1s XPS spectrum of the fresh catalyst, the percentages of BSi bond (187.0eV) and BO bond (189.8eV) were 49.4% and 46.6%, while the suboxide (BxOy, y/x<1.5, 192.6eV) species
[29]
contributed the rest 4.0% (
Fig. 2
b). The Si 2p signal can be deconvoluted into three peaks centered at 99.4eV, 102.8eV and 103.3eV, corresponding to SiB bonds, SiO bonds and the silica (SiO2, 103.8eV) (
Fig. 2
c). Upon exposure to the ODH of propane reaction (535C), the surface oxygen concentrations increased to 50.4% after 1h (SiB-1h) and 54.8% after 3h (SiB-3h) (
Table S4
). Furthermore, a higher binding energy of the B 1s signal located at 193.8eV was detected for SiB-1h and SiB-3h catalysts, which was assigned to the boron oxide (B2O3,
Fig. 2
b). The specific surface area decreased from 23m2g1 to 5m2g1 after 3h might attribute to the formation of B2O3. However, as the catalytic activity increasing during the activation process, the concentrations of boron decreased to 31.8% after 1h and 30.2% after 3h, estimated from the B 1s XPS spectrum, suggesting that the catalytic activity was not direct related to boron concentration on the surfaces of the silicon boride. In contrast, the percentages of BO species (BxOy and B2O3) in B 1s XPS spectrum increased to 46.8% after 1h and 79.7% after 3h, indicating that the increased catalytic activity might relate to the newly generated BO species.
After running catalyst for 9h, the XPS spectra had no obvious changes referring to SiB-3h (
Fig. S6
), suggesting the surface of silicon boride retained stable after 3h reactions. This can be explained by the antioxidant ability of silicon boride. In addition, the XPS analysis (
Fig. 2
b) identified that the oxygen and BO species concentrations of the SiB-O2 catalyst were lower than those of the SiB-3h catalyst. Interestingly, Zhou et al.
[28]
showed that the h-BN activated by C2H6 and O2 presented much higher performance than treated with O2 or C2H6 solely. These phenomena demonstrated that the catalyst could be more effectively oxidized in reaction atmosphere. One of the speculated reasons is the in situ generated water on the catalysts surface can accelerate the oxidation rate of boride
[30]
. In addition, the presence of alkane may promote molecular oxygen dissociation then produce oxygen radicals
[17]
and leading to more effective oxidation of catalysts.
We conducted in situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier-Transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy coupled with an online mass spectroscopy (MS) for simultaneous monitoring the catalyst and the product of propane ODH, in order to better understand the reaction process (
Fig. 3
). As the reaction proceeding, the DRIFT difference spectra of the catalyst and the corresponding MS signal of propylene were recorded under aerobic or anaerobic conditions by switching the feed gas from N2 to C3H8 and then to C3H8/O2, respectively. Under the C3H8 atmosphere, the strong alkyl stretching signal at 2965cm1 is attributable to the presence of propane gas
[31]
, and no MS signal of propylene was detected (see the blue line in
Fig. 3
b), which indicates the silicon boride catalyst is unreactive for the dehydrogenation of propane under anaerobic conditions. With the addition of molecular oxygen, the stretching of boron-oxygen
[32]
,
[33]
(BO) for BO species at 1250cm1 gradually reduced, accompanied with the formation of propylene (see the red line in
Fig. 3
b), suggesting that the BO groups were incorporated into the reaction network. Moreover, when catalyst was just exposed to O2 atmosphere, the position of the absorption band of silicon boride catalyst remained unchanged (
Fig. S8
), indicating that the catalyst did not interact with O2 in the absence of propane.

Huang et al.
[18]
reported that the BO sites formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites in the ODH of ethane. Grant et al.
[16]
found that the high selectivity of propylene in the ODH of propane was related to the formation of BOx active site at the surfaces of h-BN and boron-containing catalysts. Our previous work
[12]
demonstrated that the BOH sites initially reacted with molecular oxygen leading to the production of BOOB intermediates and further abstracted the hydrogen atoms from propane, forming C3H6 and H2O in the ODH of propane. Besides, Zhou et al.
[28]
further proved that the BOH species can promote the adsorption of O2 through adsorption microcalorimetric experiments. In this work, the results in
Fig. 3
showed that the BO groups took part in the reaction network. However, the BO groups themselves have no catalytic activity for CH cleavage
[17]
. Extensive studies have showed that the BOH groups easily generates from BO species in the presence of steam
[33]
,
[34]
. Therefore, the high ODH activity in silicon boride catalyst most likely resulted from the BOH groups formed from the BO species on the surfaces of silicon boride with an assistance of steam.
Further isotope-labeling measurements were used to investigate the reaction process. As shown in
Fig. 5
, when the silicon boride catalyst has been treated by D2O (labeled as SiB-D) and then pulsed into C3H8 and O2 at 535C, both HDO and D2O were formed immediately with the formation of propylene, and their amounts gradually decreased during subsequent pulses. This result suggested that the H/D atoms in the SiB-D catalyst were abstracted during the reaction process, and also implied that the BOH(D) groups of silicon boride catalyst might incorporate into the ODH reaction.
3.3. Kinetic analysis
Kinetic experiments were performed to gain insights into the reaction pathway of light alkanes ODH over the silicon boride catalyst. The effect of propane and oxygen concentrations on the reaction rate was shown in

The kinetic analysis exhibited that the reaction order of oxygen approached 0.5. In our previous work
[14]
, an 18O isotope tracer study verified that an oxygen exchange between the surface oxygen atoms in the BOH groups and molecular oxygen occurred in the reaction of ODH process at hydroxylated h-BN catalyst. Huang et al.
[18]
also found that the atomic exchange between 16O2 and 18O2 in the reaction of ODH process at h-BN catalyst. Therefore, it was reasonable to speculate that molecular oxygen may dissociate on surface of catalyst in the reaction process. As shown in Eq.
(1)
, a near second-order dependence of propane concentration suggested that the activation of propane determined the total reaction rate. An increase in selectivity as increasing oxygen concentration (
Fig. 4
c) revealed that molecular oxygen favors the formation of propylene. Similar kinetic behaviors were also observed in ODH of ethane and isobutane (
Fig. S9
), which suggested that the light alkanes have an analogous reaction mechanism over silicon boride catalyst.
Moreover, the apparent activation energy (Ea,
Fig. S10
) were estimated to be 268kJmol1, 244kJmol1 and 160kJmol1 for ethane, propane and isobutane, respectively. The values of Ea were obvious higher than those reported for metal oxide catalysts. The difference in Ea of light alkanes does correspond to the difference in bond strength of the weakest CH bond in each corresponding alkane (the order of the weakest CH bond strength: C2H6>C3H8>i-C4H10), implying that the kinetically-relevant step might involve CH cleavage during ODH using silicon boride catalyst.
4. Conclusions
We have shown that silicon boride is an active metal-free catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to valuable olefins with high selectivity. When the conversion of ethane, propane and isobutane reached 18.8%, 19.1% and 6.0%, the selectivity of total olefins were up to 98.0%, 94.4% and 96.4%, respectively. The light olefins productivity of 1.22.6golefinsgcat1h1 were obtained. The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensured the catalytic stability. Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, the BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites. This work experimentally supports that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiate the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
