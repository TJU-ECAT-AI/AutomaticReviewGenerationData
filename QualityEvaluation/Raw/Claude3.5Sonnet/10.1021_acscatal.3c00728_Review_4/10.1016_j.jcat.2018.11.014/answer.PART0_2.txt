The literature does not directly address the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or discuss synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase radical reactions. However, the document provides some insights that can be extended to partially answer the question:

The reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts appears to involve multiple components, including surface reactions and potentially gas-phase processes. The active sites are believed to be BOH groups on the catalyst surface, which selectively break C-H bonds. The overall reaction network likely involves interactions between these surface sites, gas-phase reactants, and intermediate species.

The document mentions spectroscopic investigations, XRD measurements, and in-situ DRIFT spectroscopy coupled with mass spectrometry to study the catalyst structure and reaction process. This multi-technique approach highlights the complexity of the reaction mechanism and the need to consider various aspects simultaneously.

The selectivity differences observed between silicon boride and other B-containing catalysts are attributed to differences in subsurface structure, suggesting that the reaction network extends beyond just surface phenomena. This implies that optimizing catalyst performance requires considering both surface and bulk properties.

While not explicitly stated, the synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions could contribute to the high selectivity and activity observed for these catalysts. Understanding these interactions could be crucial for further catalyst design optimization.

The multidimensional nature of the reaction mechanism underscores the importance of comprehensive characterization and in-situ studies to fully elucidate the reaction network and guide catalyst development. Future research may need to focus on integrating surface science, spectroscopy, and kinetic studies to capture the full complexity of the ODHP process over B-based catalysts.

虽然文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂ODHP反应机理的多维性质或表面和气相自由基反应之间的协同效应，但文档提供了一些可以延伸用来部分回答问题的见解：

B基催化剂的反应机理似乎涉及多个组成部分，包括表面反应和潜在的气相过程。活性位点被认为是催化剂表面的BOH基团，可选择性地断裂C-H键。整体反应网络可能涉及这些表面位点、气相反应物和中间物种之间的相互作用。

文档提到使用光谱研究、XRD测量以及原位DRIFT光谱与质谱联用来研究催化剂结构和反应过程。这种多技术方法突出了反应机理的复杂性，以及同时考虑各个方面的必要性。

硅硼化物与其他含硼催化剂之间观察到的选择性差异被归因于亚表面结构的差异，这表明反应网络不仅仅局限于表面现象。这意味着优化催化剂性能需要同时考虑表面和体相性质。

虽然没有明确指出，但表面反应和气相反应之间的协同效应可能有助于这些催化剂表现出高选择性和活性。理解这些相互作用对于进一步的催化剂设计优化可能至关重要。

反应机理的多维性质强调了全面表征和原位研究的重要性，以充分阐明反应网络并指导催化剂开发。未来的研究可能需要集成表面科学、光谱学和动力学研究，以捕捉B基催化剂上ODHP过程的全部复杂性。
