[1] "Hermans and co-workers proposed that BOON, later on boron oxygen species were responsible for high activity and olefins selectivity that were influenced by electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures."

[2] "Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2"

[3] "Zhou et al. further proved that the BOH species can promote the adsorption of O2 through adsorption microcalorimetric experiments."

[4] "Therefore, the high ODH activity in silicon boride catalyst most likely resulted from the BOH groups formed from the BO species on the surfaces of silicon boride with an assistance of steam."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. The literature suggests that boron oxygen species, particularly BOH groups, play a crucial role in the catalytic process. These surface species are responsible for selectively breaking C-H bonds while inhibiting over-oxidation to CO2. 

The synergistic effects between surface reactions and gas-phase processes have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. The formation of BOH groups from BO species, assisted by steam, appears to be a key factor in achieving high ODH activity. Additionally, the ability of BOH species to promote O2 adsorption suggests a complex interplay between surface sites and gas-phase oxygen.

Understanding these multidimensional aspects allows for more targeted catalyst design strategies. By optimizing the formation and stability of active BOH sites, as well as controlling the balance between C-H bond activation and over-oxidation prevention, researchers can work towards developing more efficient and selective B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. This comprehensive approach, considering both surface chemistry and gas-phase interactions, is crucial for advancing catalyst performance and addressing the challenges associated with selective olefin production.

基于硼的催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，显著增进了我们对整个反应网络的理解。文献表明，硼氧物种，特别是BOH基团，在催化过程中起着关键作用。这些表面物种负责选择性地断裂C-H键，同时抑制过度氧化为CO2。

表面反应和气相过程之间的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化具有重要影响。在蒸汽的辅助下，从BO物种形成BOH基团似乎是实现高ODH活性的关键因素。此外，BOH物种促进O2吸附的能力表明表面位点和气相氧之间存在复杂的相互作用。

理解这些多维方面允许我们采用更有针对性的催化剂设计策略。通过优化活性BOH位点的形成和稳定性，以及控制C-H键活化和防止过度氧化之间的平衡，研究人员可以致力于开发更高效、更选择性的基于硼的ODHP反应催化剂。这种综合方法，同时考虑表面化学和气相相互作用，对于提高催化剂性能和解决选择性烯烃生产相关的挑战至关重要。
