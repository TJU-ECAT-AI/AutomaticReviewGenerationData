The literature does not directly address the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or discuss synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase radical reactions. The study focuses primarily on the surface reactions and active sites of the silicon boride catalyst.

However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the reaction mechanism involves both surface and gas-phase processes. The spectroscopic investigation suggests that BOH groups on the catalyst surface are the active sites for C-H bond breaking. The kinetic analysis reveals the involvement of gas-phase oxygen and alkanes in the reaction. 

The study of reaction pathways through kinetic experiments and activation energy measurements provides insights into the overall reaction network. The differences in activation energies for different alkanes correspond to the strength of their weakest C-H bonds, implying that C-H bond cleavage is a key step in the reaction mechanism.

While the paper does not explicitly discuss the synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions, understanding these interactions could be crucial for optimizing catalyst performance. The ability of the catalyst to selectively break C-H bonds while preventing over-oxidation suggests a delicate balance between surface-catalyzed and gas-phase reactions.

For catalyst design optimization, this implies the need to carefully control the formation and distribution of active BOH sites on the catalyst surface, while also considering how these sites interact with gas-phase species. Future research could focus on elucidating the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions to further improve catalyst selectivity and efficiency.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，也没有探讨表面反应和气相自由基反应之间的协同效应。这项研究主要集中在硅硼化物催化剂的表面反应和活性位点上。

然而，根据所提供的信息，我们可以推断反应机理涉及表面和气相过程。光谱研究表明，催化剂表面的BOH基团是C-H键断裂的活性位点。动力学分析揭示了气相氧和烷烃参与反应的情况。

通过动力学实验和活化能测量来研究反应途径，为整体反应网络提供了洞见。不同烷烃的活化能差异与它们最弱C-H键的强度相对应，说明C-H键断裂是反应机理中的关键步骤。

虽然论文没有明确讨论表面反应和气相反应之间的协同效应，但理解这些相互作用对于优化催化剂性能可能至关重要。催化剂能够选择性地断裂C-H键同时防止过度氧化，这表明表面催化反应和气相反应之间存在微妙的平衡。

对于催化剂设计优化，这意味着需要仔细控制催化剂表面活性BOH位点的形成和分布，同时还要考虑这些位点如何与气相物种相互作用。未来的研究可以集中在阐明表面反应和气相反应之间的相互作用，以进一步提高催化剂的选择性和效率。
