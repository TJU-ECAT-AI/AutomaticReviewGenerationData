[1] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."

[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."

[3] "Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts."

[4] "By coupling the results from kinetic and SVUV-PIMS studies with DFT calculations, detailed reaction pathways are proposed for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts. Propene is mainly formed from surface reaction via the cleavage of CH bonds of propane. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions pathways can contribute to the C1 and C2 products."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complex interplay between surface-mediated and gas-phase processes provides a more comprehensive picture of the reaction dynamics.

The discovery of gas-phase methyl radicals using SVUV-PIMS reveals the existence of parallel reaction pathways. While propene is primarily generated on the catalyst surface through CH activation of propane, C1 and C2 products can form via both surface-mediated and gas-phase routes. This dual-pathway mechanism explains the unique product distribution observed in B-based catalysts compared to traditional metal oxide catalysts.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. Understanding these multifaceted processes allows for more targeted catalyst development, potentially leading to improved selectivity and yield. By manipulating the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions, it may be possible to fine-tune product distributions and minimize unwanted side reactions.

Moreover, this mechanistic insight opens up new avenues for catalyst design. Future catalysts could be engineered to promote or suppress specific pathways, depending on the desired product profile. For instance, catalysts could be designed to enhance surface reactions for increased propene selectivity or to promote gas-phase radical chemistry for higher yields of C1 and C2 products.

In conclusion, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts provides a more nuanced understanding of the reaction network, enabling more informed and targeted approaches to catalyst design and optimization.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性，包括表面和气相自由基反应，显著提高了我们对整个反应网络的理解。表面介导和气相过程之间的这种复杂相互作用为反应动力学提供了更全面的图景。

使用SVUV-PIMS发现气相甲基自由基揭示了并行反应途径的存在。虽然丙烯主要通过丙烷的CH活化在催化剂表面生成，但C1和C2产物可以通过表面介导和气相两种途径形成。这种双路径机制解释了B基催化剂与传统金属氧化物催化剂相比观察到的独特产物分布。

表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响。理解这些多方面的过程允许更有针对性的催化剂开发，可能导致选择性和产率的提高。通过操纵表面和气相反应之间的平衡，可能可以微调产品分布并最小化不需要的副反应。

此外，这种机理洞察为催化剂设计开辟了新途径。未来的催化剂可以被设计成促进或抑制特定路径，这取决于所需的产品配置。例如，可以设计催化剂来增强表面反应以提高丙烯选择性，或促进气相自由基化学以提高C1和C2产物的产率。

总之，B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性提供了对反应网络更细致的理解，使得催化剂设计和优化能够采取更明智和有针对性的方法。
