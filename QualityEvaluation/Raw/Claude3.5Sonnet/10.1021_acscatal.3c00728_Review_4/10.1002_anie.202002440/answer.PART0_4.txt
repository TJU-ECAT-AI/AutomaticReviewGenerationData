[1] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."

[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."

[3] "Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts."

[4] "By coupling the results from kinetic and SVUV-PIMS studies with DFT calculations, detailed reaction pathways are proposed for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts. Propene is mainly formed from surface reaction via the cleavage of CH bonds of propane. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions pathways can contribute to the C1 and C2 products."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This comprehensive view reveals that the reaction proceeds through multiple pathways, each contributing to different product formations.

The surface reactions are primarily responsible for the formation of propene, the main desired product, through CH activation of propane. Simultaneously, the existence of gas-phase radical pathways, particularly involving methyl radicals, contributes to the formation of C1 and C2 products. This dual nature of the reaction mechanism explains the unique product distribution observed in B-based catalysts compared to traditional metal oxide catalysts.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. Understanding these complex interactions allows for more targeted catalyst design strategies. For instance, optimizing surface sites for propene formation while minimizing gas-phase radical reactions could potentially enhance selectivity towards the desired product.

Furthermore, this mechanistic insight provides a foundation for developing more selective catalysts for alkane ODH. By manipulating the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions, it may be possible to fine-tune product distributions and improve overall catalyst efficiency. This knowledge also opens up new avenues for catalyst characterization and in-situ studies, emphasizing the importance of techniques that can probe both surface and gas-phase species simultaneously.

In conclusion, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts not only deepens our fundamental understanding but also provides practical guidelines for future catalyst design and optimization in the field of alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.
