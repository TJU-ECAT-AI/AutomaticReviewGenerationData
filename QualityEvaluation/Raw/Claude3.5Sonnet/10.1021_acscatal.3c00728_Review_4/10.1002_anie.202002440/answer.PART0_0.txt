[1] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."

[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."

[3] "To investigate the possible radical chemistry, the gas-phase components of the ODHP reaction over h-BN-T catalysts were analyzed online by synchrotron radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS;"

[4] "By coupling the results from kinetic and SVUV-PIMS studies with DFT calculations, detailed reaction pathways are proposed for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts. Propene is mainly formed from surface reaction via the cleavage of CH bonds of propane. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions pathways can contribute to the C1 and C2 products."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This comprehensive view reveals that the reaction proceeds through multiple pathways, with different products forming via distinct mechanisms.

The main product, propene, is primarily generated through surface reactions, specifically the CH activation of propane on the catalyst surface. In contrast, C1 and C2 products can form through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. This dual-pathway mechanism for byproduct formation adds complexity to the reaction network and highlights the importance of considering both heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions in the ODHP process.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Selectivity control: Understanding the different formation pathways for desired products (propene) and byproducts (C1 and C2) allows for more targeted approaches to improve selectivity. By optimizing surface properties to favor propene formation while minimizing gas-phase radical reactions, catalysts with enhanced selectivity can be developed.

2. Reaction condition optimization: The knowledge of gas-phase radical involvement enables better control of reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed composition) to suppress undesired gas-phase reactions and promote surface-mediated pathways.

3. Catalyst design strategies: The multidimensional mechanism suggests that catalyst design should focus not only on surface active sites but also on controlling the formation and reactivity of gas-phase radicals. This could involve developing catalysts with specific pore structures or surface properties that can influence radical behavior.

4. Mechanistic insights for new catalysts: The understanding gained from B-based catalysts can guide the development of new catalyst systems that exploit both surface and gas-phase chemistry for improved ODHP performance.

5. Modeling and prediction: The comprehensive reaction network allows for more accurate kinetic modeling and prediction of catalyst behavior under various conditions, facilitating faster and more efficient catalyst optimization.

In conclusion, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism provides a more complete picture of the process, enabling more informed and targeted approaches to catalyst design and reaction optimization. This enhanced understanding paves the way for developing highly selective and efficient catalysts for alkane ODH reactions.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，显著增进了我们对整个反应网络的理解。这种全面的视角揭示了反应通过多种途径进行，不同产物通过不同的机制形成。

主要产物丙烯主要通过表面反应生成，特别是在催化剂表面上丙烷的CH活化。相比之下，C1和C2产物可以通过表面介导和气相途径形成。副产物形成的这种双路径机制增加了反应网络的复杂性，并突显了在ODHP过程中同时考虑非均相和均相反应的重要性。

表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 选择性控制：了解所需产物（丙烯）和副产物（C1和C2）的不同形成途径，可以采取更有针对性的方法来提高选择性。通过优化表面性质以有利于丙烯形成，同时最小化气相自由基反应，可以开发出选择性更高的催化剂。

2. 反应条件优化：了解气相自由基的参与，可以更好地控制反应条件（温度、压力、进料组成），以抑制不需要的气相反应并促进表面介导的途径。

3. 催化剂设计策略：多维机制表明，催化剂设计不仅应关注表面活性位点，还应控制气相自由基的形成和反应性。这可能涉及开发具有特定孔结构或表面性质的催化剂，以影响自由基行为。

4. 新催化剂的机理洞察：从B基催化剂获得的理解可以指导开发新的催化剂系统，利用表面和气相化学反应来改善ODHP性能。

5. 建模和预测：全面的反应网络允许对各种条件下的催化剂行为进行更准确的动力学建模和预测，促进更快速和更高效的催化剂优化。

总之，ODHP反应机理的多维性提供了对该过程更完整的图景，使得催化剂设计和反应优化能够采取更明智和有针对性的方法。这种增强的理解为开发高选择性和高效率的烷烃ODH反应催化剂铺平了道路。
