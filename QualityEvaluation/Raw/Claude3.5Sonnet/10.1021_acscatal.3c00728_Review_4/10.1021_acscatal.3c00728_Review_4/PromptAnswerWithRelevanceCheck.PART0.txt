[1] "With increasing research in this field, the ODHP reaction has gradually been discovered to involve a mixed mechanism including both complicated surface and gas radical reactions instead of a simple surface catalytic process. Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase."

[2] "For the ODHP reaction, both the surface reaction and gas radical reaction occur at the same time. The surface reaction rate will affect the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction will also have an adverse effect on the surface reaction. The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP."

[3] "The mixed heterogeneoushomogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which can be described as the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acting as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase. Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system."

[4] "Notably, some free radicals such as ·OOH, ·C3H7, ·OC3H7, etc., are transferred and exchanged between the surface and gas phase in the whole reaction network. Therefore, the influence of catalyst configuration on free radical transport and reaction must be considered in catalyst design."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complex mechanism reveals that the ODHP reaction is not a simple surface catalytic process but involves interactions between 1- and 2-D surface-active sites and 3-D gas-phase reactions.

The synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions contribute to the high activity and selectivity of propene during ODHP. The surface reactions, primarily occurring on boron oxide/hydroxide phases, initiate the formation of alkyl radicals. These radicals then participate in further reactions in the gas phase, creating a mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism.

This multidimensional understanding has several implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Catalyst design must consider both surface properties and their impact on gas-phase radical reactions.

2. The configuration of the catalyst bed becomes crucial, as it affects the transport and reaction of free radicals between surface and gas phases.

3. Optimizing the coupling between surface and gas-phase reactions is key to achieving high activity and selectivity.

4. Catalyst development should focus on creating materials that can effectively balance and control both surface-initiated reactions and subsequent gas-phase processes.

5. Understanding the transfer and exchange of free radicals between surface and gas phases is essential for improving catalyst performance.

By considering these multidimensional aspects, researchers can develop more effective B-based catalytic systems with improved activity, selectivity, and overall performance in ODHP reactions.
