[1] "With increasing research in this field, the ODHP reaction has gradually been discovered to involve a mixed mechanism including both complicated surface and gas radical reactions instead of a simple surface catalytic process. Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase."

[2] "From the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion, we divide the reaction mechanism into two parts: surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism."

[3] "For the ODHP reaction, both the surface reaction and gas radical reaction occur at the same time. The surface reaction rate will affect the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction will also have an adverse effect on the surface reaction. The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP."

[4] "Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complex mechanism reveals that the reaction occurs not only on 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D gas phase, highlighting the interplay between heterogeneous and homogeneous processes.

This understanding has several implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Reaction complexity: The mechanism involves a mix of surface and gas radical reactions, rather than a simple surface catalytic process. This complexity needs to be considered when designing catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions.

2. Spatial considerations: The reaction occurs in multiple dimensions, from surface sites to the gas phase. Catalyst design should account for both surface properties and the ability to facilitate gas-phase reactions.

3. Synergistic effects: The surface reaction rate affects gas-phase free radical processes, and vice versa. Optimizing the coupling between these two processes is crucial for achieving high activity and selectivity.

4. Catalyst bed configuration: The interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions means that catalyst bed configuration, including factors like mass and heat transfer, can significantly impact overall performance.

5. Reaction control: Understanding the multidimensional nature of the reaction allows for better control over the formation of desired products and the minimization of unwanted side reactions.

6. Catalyst design: The insights gained from this multidimensional understanding can guide the development of more effective B-based catalytic systems, focusing on optimizing both surface properties and the ability to facilitate beneficial gas-phase reactions.

In conclusion, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism provides a more comprehensive understanding of the process, enabling researchers to design more efficient catalysts and optimize reaction conditions for improved performance in propene production.
