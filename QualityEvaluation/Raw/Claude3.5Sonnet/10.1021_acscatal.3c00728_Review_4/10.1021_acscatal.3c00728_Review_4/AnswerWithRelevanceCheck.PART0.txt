          [1] "With increasing research in this field, the ODHP reaction has gradually been discovered to involve a mixed mechanism including both complicated surface and gas radical reactions instead of a simple surface catalytic process. Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase."

[2] "For the ODHP reaction, both the surface reaction and gas radical reaction occur at the same time. The surface reaction rate will affect the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction will also have an adverse effect on the surface reaction. The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP."

[3] "The mixed heterogeneoushomogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which can be described as the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acting as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase. Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system."

[4] "Notably, some free radicals such as ·OOH, ·C3H7, ·OC3H7, etc., are transferred and exchanged between the surface and gas phase in the whole reaction network. Therefore, the influence of catalyst configuration on free radical transport and reaction must be considered in catalyst design."

          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complex mechanism reveals that the reaction is not limited to simple surface catalysis but extends into the 3-D gas phase space.

Key contributions to our understanding include:

1. Mixed Mechanism: The ODHP reaction involves a combination of surface and gas radical reactions, rather than just surface catalysis.

2. Spatial Complexity: Reactions occur on 1- and 2-D surface-active sites and in the 3-D gas phase space.

3. Synergistic Effects: Surface reaction rates influence gas-phase free radical processes, and vice versa. The effective coupling of these processes is crucial for high activity and selectivity.

4. Heterogeneous-Homogeneous Mechanism: Boron oxide/hydroxide on the catalyst surface initiates alkyl radical formation, which then react in the gas phase.

5. Radical Transfer: Free radicals are exchanged between surface and gas phases, affecting the overall reaction network.

Implications for catalyst performance and design optimization include:

1. Holistic Design Approach: Catalysts must be designed considering both surface properties and their impact on gas-phase reactions.

2. Optimization of Synergy: Enhancing the coupling between surface and gas-phase reactions is key to improving activity and selectivity.

3. Catalyst Configuration: The design must account for free radical transport and reactions between surface and gas phases.

4. Reaction Control: Understanding the multidimensional nature allows for better control over product formation and minimization of side reactions.

5. Advanced Modeling: More complex models incorporating both surface and gas-phase kinetics are needed for accurate performance prediction.

6. Reactor Design: Considerations for both surface catalysis and gas-phase reactions may influence reactor dimensions and catalyst bed configurations.

In conclusion, this multidimensional understanding provides a more comprehensive framework for catalyst design and process optimization, potentially leading to more efficient and selective B-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

          B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，显著提高了我们对整个反应网络的理解。这种复杂的机理揭示了反应不仅限于简单的表面催化，还延伸到了3D气相空间。

对我们理解的关键贡献包括：

1. 混合机理：ODHP反应涉及表面和气相自由基反应的组合，而不仅仅是表面催化。

2. 空间复杂性：反应发生在1D和2D表面活性位点以及3D气相空间中。

3. 协同效应：表面反应速率影响气相自由基过程，反之亦然。这些过程的有效耦合对高活性和选择性至关重要。

4. 异相-均相机理：催化剂表面的硼氧化物/氢氧化物启动烷基自由基的形成，然后在气相中反应。

5. 自由基转移：自由基在表面和气相之间交换，影响整个反应网络。

对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响包括：

1. 整体设计方法：催化剂设计必须同时考虑表面性质及其对气相反应的影响。

2. 协同优化：增强表面和气相反应之间的耦合是提高活性和选择性的关键。

3. 催化剂构型：设计必须考虑表面和气相之间的自由基传输和反应。

4. 反应控制：理解多维特性允许更好地控制产物形成和最小化副反应。

5. 先进建模：需要更复杂的模型，同时包含表面和气相动力学，以准确预测性能。

6. 反应器设计：对表面催化和气相反应的考虑可能影响反应器尺寸和催化剂床构型。

总之，这种多维理解为催化剂设计和过程优化提供了更全面的框架，有可能导致更高效和选择性的丙烷脱氢B基催化剂。
