[1] "With increasing research in this field, the ODHP reaction has gradually been discovered to involve a mixed mechanism including both complicated surface and gas radical reactions instead of a simple surface catalytic process. Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase."

[2] "From the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion, we divide the reaction mechanism into two parts: surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism."

[3] "For the ODHP reaction, both the surface reaction and gas radical reaction occur at the same time. The surface reaction rate will affect the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction will also have an adverse effect on the surface reaction. The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP."

[4] "Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complex mechanism reveals that the reaction is not limited to simple surface catalysis but extends into the 3-D space of the gas phase.

The interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions contributes to a more comprehensive view of the reaction network. Surface reactions occur on 1- and 2-D active sites, while gas radical reactions take place in the 3-D gas phase. This dual nature allows for a more detailed understanding of how reactants are activated, intermediates are formed, and products are generated.

The synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Enhanced activity and selectivity: The effective coupling of surface and gas-phase processes plays a crucial role in achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP.

2. Improved catalyst design: Understanding the multidimensional nature of the reaction allows for the development of more effective B-based catalytic systems that can optimize both surface and gas-phase reactions.

3. Reaction control: By manipulating the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions, it may be possible to fine-tune the reaction outcomes and improve overall performance.

4. Catalyst bed configuration: The multidimensional nature of the reaction highlights the importance of considering catalyst bed configuration, as it can significantly impact the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions.

5. Process optimization: Knowledge of the complex reaction network enables better control of reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations, to maximize desired outcomes.

In conclusion, the multidimensional understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism provides a more holistic view of the process, allowing for more informed catalyst design and process optimization strategies that can lead to improved performance in industrial applications.
