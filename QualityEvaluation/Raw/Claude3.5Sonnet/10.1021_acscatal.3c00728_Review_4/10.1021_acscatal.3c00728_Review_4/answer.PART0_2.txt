[1] "With increasing research in this field, the ODHP reaction has gradually been discovered to involve a mixed mechanism including both complicated surface and gas radical reactions instead of a simple surface catalytic process."

[2] "Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase."

[3] "For the ODHP reaction, both the surface reaction and gas radical reaction occur at the same time. The surface reaction rate will affect the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction will also have an adverse effect on the surface reaction."

[4] "The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP."

[5] "Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly expands our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complex mechanism reveals that the reaction is not limited to simple surface catalysis but extends into the 3D gas phase space.

The synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions are crucial for catalyst performance. The surface reaction rate influences gas-phase free radical processes, while gas-phase radical reactions affect surface reactions. This interplay is key to achieving high activity and high propene selectivity in ODHP reactions.

Understanding this multidimensional mechanism has important implications for catalyst design optimization. It suggests that effective catalysts must balance surface and gas-phase reactions, rather than focusing solely on surface properties. Catalyst bed configuration, reactor dimensions, and gas composition all become important considerations in optimizing performance.

Moreover, this understanding allows for more targeted research into improving catalyst efficiency. By considering both surface and gas-phase aspects, researchers can develop strategies to enhance the synergy between these processes, potentially leading to more effective B-based catalytic systems with improved activity and selectivity.

In conclusion, the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism provides a more comprehensive view of the reaction network, highlighting the importance of considering both surface and gas-phase reactions in catalyst design and optimization. This approach opens new avenues for improving catalyst performance and efficiency in ODHP reactions.
