[1] "With increasing research in this field, the ODHP reaction has gradually been discovered to involve a mixed mechanism including both complicated surface and gas radical reactions instead of a simple surface catalytic process. Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase."

[2] "For the ODHP reaction, both the surface reaction and gas radical reaction occur at the same time. The surface reaction rate will affect the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction will also have an adverse effect on the surface reaction. The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP."

[3] "The mixed heterogeneoushomogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which can be described as the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acting as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase. Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system."

[4] "Notably, some free radicals such as ·OOH, ·C3H7, ·OC3H7, etc., are transferred and exchanged between the surface and gas phase in the whole reaction network. Therefore, the influence of catalyst configuration on free radical transport and reaction must be considered in catalyst design."

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complex mechanism reveals that the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space of the gas phase, challenging the previous notion of a simple surface catalytic process.

The synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Reaction kinetics: The surface reaction rate influences gas-phase free radical processes, while gas-phase radical reactions affect surface reactions. This interplay is crucial for achieving high activity and high propene selectivity.

2. Catalyst design: The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism suggests that the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the catalyst surface initiates the formation of alkyl radicals, which then react in the gas phase. This understanding is vital for designing more effective B-based catalytic systems.

3. Radical transport: The transfer and exchange of free radicals (e.g., ·OOH, ·C3H7, ·OC3H7) between the surface and gas phase necessitate careful consideration of catalyst configuration to optimize radical transport and reactions.

4. Performance optimization: Achieving synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions is key to enhancing catalyst performance, as it affects both activity and selectivity in the ODHP process.

5. Reactor design: The multidimensional nature of the reaction mechanism implies that reactor design must account for both surface catalysis and gas-phase reactions, potentially influencing parameters such as catalyst bed configuration and reactor dimensions.

In conclusion, the multidimensional understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism provides a more comprehensive framework for catalyst design and process optimization, potentially leading to more efficient and selective B-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维特性，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，显著提高了我们对整个反应网络的理解。这种复杂的机理揭示了反应不仅发生在1和2维表面活性位点上，还发生在气相的3维空间中，挑战了先前简单表面催化过程的概念。

表面和气相反应之间的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 反应动力学：表面反应速率影响气相自由基过程，而气相自由基反应也影响表面反应。这种相互作用对实现高活性和高丙烯选择性至关重要。

2. 催化剂设计：混合异相-均相ODH机理表明，催化剂表面的硼氧化物/氢氧化物相启动烷基自由基的形成，这些自由基随后在气相中反应。这种理解对设计更有效的B基催化系统至关重要。

3. 自由基传输：自由基（如·OOH，·C3H7，·OC3H7）在表面和气相之间的传递和交换，需要仔细考虑催化剂构型以优化自由基传输和反应。

4. 性能优化：实现表面和气相反应之间的协同作用是提高催化剂性能的关键，因为它影响ODHP过程中的活性和选择性。

5. 反应器设计：反应机理的多维性意味着反应器设计必须考虑表面催化和气相反应，可能影响诸如催化剂床构型和反应器尺寸等参数。

总之，对ODHP反应机理的多维理解为催化剂设计和过程优化提供了更全面的框架，有可能导致更高效和选择性的丙烷脱氢B基催化剂。
