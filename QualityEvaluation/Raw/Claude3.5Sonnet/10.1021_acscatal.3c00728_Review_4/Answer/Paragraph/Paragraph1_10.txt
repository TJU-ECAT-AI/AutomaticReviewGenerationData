The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism in boron-based catalysts presents a complex, multidimensional landscape that demands a holistic approach for comprehensive understanding. This intricate process involves the interplay between surface reactions occurring on the catalyst and gas-phase radical reactions, creating a dynamic system that influences overall catalytic performance. By integrating these two crucial aspects, researchers can gain deeper insights into the synergistic effects that drive the reaction. Surface reactions, including propane activation and oxygen incorporation, occur in tandem with gas-phase radical chain reactions, which can propagate and amplify the catalytic process. This interconnected network of reactions necessitates a nuanced analysis of factors such as catalyst composition, surface properties, and reaction conditions to optimize performance. Understanding the delicate balance between these multifaceted components is essential for designing more efficient and selective B-based catalysts for ODHP, ultimately paving the way for improved industrial applications and a more sustainable approach to propylene production.
