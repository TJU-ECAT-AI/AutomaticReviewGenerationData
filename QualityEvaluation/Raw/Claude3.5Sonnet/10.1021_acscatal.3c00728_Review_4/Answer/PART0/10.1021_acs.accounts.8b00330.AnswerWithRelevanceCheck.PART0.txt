          [1] "We hypothesize that hBN activates oxygen and forms surface oxygen species responsible for selective alkane oxidation."

[2] "Buyevskaya et al. carried out Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) experiments to determine the mechanism of propane and oxygen activation in B2O3/Al2O3. The study demonstrated that BOx surface species hinder the H/D exchange between the surface and C3D8 as well as the formation of 18O16O isotopologues. These TAP experiments led the authors to conclude that surface BOx suppresses dissociative adsorption of reactants and was the likely reason for high selectivities toward the olefin product."

[3] "The authors proposed a mechanism involving propyl radical formation on the catalyst surface and continuation of the reaction in the gas phase via alkyl hydroperoxides. While gas phase peroxide and radical decomposition mechanisms are common in combustion and methane conversion literature, further investigations on their role during ODH chemistry will be needed, particularly in the context of high olefin selectivities of B-based catalysts."

[4] "Furthermore, the role of gas phase chemistry must be established and its importance on the observed ODH activity under various conditions considered in future model development."

          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complexity highlights the intricate interplay between heterogeneous catalysis on the boron-based surface and homogeneous gas-phase chemistry.

Surface reactions likely involve the activation of oxygen to form selective oxidizing species, which then interact with alkanes. The formation of propyl radicals on the catalyst surface initiates the dehydrogenation process. These surface reactions are crucial for the high selectivity observed in B-based catalysts, as the BOx species appear to suppress the dissociative adsorption of reactants, which could otherwise lead to overoxidation.

The gas-phase component of the reaction involves the continuation of the dehydrogenation process through alkyl hydroperoxides and other radical species. This step is critical for completing the formation of olefins and may contribute to the high selectivity observed in these systems.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Selectivity control: The interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for better control of product selectivity.
2. Reaction pathway manipulation: Understanding the multidimensional nature of the reaction allows for potential manipulation of reaction pathways.
3. Catalyst design: Recognition of both surface and gas-phase components provides new avenues for catalyst design.
4. Process optimization: A holistic approach to process optimization is required, considering factors such as reactor design, gas flow dynamics, and temperature profiles.
5. Mechanistic insights: The multidimensional nature provides a more complete picture of the ODHP process, allowing for better predictive models and mechanistic understanding.

Further investigations are needed to fully elucidate the role of gas-phase chemistry in ODH reactions, particularly in relation to the high olefin selectivities observed with B-based catalysts. This highlights the complexity of the reaction network and the need for continued research to optimize catalyst performance and design.

          B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，显著增进了我们对整体反应网络的理解。这种复杂性突显了硼基表面上的多相催化作用与均相气相化学之间的复杂相互作用。

表面反应可能涉及氧气的活化，形成选择性氧化物种，然后与烷烃相互作用。在催化剂表面形成丙基自由基启动了脱氢过程。这些表面反应对于B基催化剂观察到的高选择性至关重要，因为BOx物种似乎抑制了反应物的解离吸附，否则可能导致过度氧化。

反应的气相部分涉及通过烷基氢过氧化物和其他自由基物种继续进行脱氢过程。这一步对于完成烯烃的形成至关重要，可能有助于这些系统中观察到的高选择性。

表面和气相反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响：

1. 选择性控制：表面和气相反应之间的相互作用允许更好地控制产品选择性。
2. 反应途径操纵：理解反应的多维性质允许潜在地操纵反应途径。
3. 催化剂设计：认识到反应机理中的表面和气相组分为催化剂设计提供了新的途径。
4. 过程优化：需要一种整体的方法来进行过程优化，考虑诸如反应器设计、气体流动动力学和温度分布等因素。
5. 机理洞察：反应的多维性质提供了ODHP过程更完整的图景，允许更好的预测模型和机理理解。

需要进一步研究以充分阐明气相化学在ODH反应中的作用，特别是在与B基催化剂观察到的高烯烃选择性相关的方面。这突出了反应网络的复杂性以及继续研究以优化催化剂性能和设计的必要性。
