          [1] "Prior studies have reported that the exceptional product distribution on h-BN catalyst is ascribed to the combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals and subsequent gaseous reactions"

[2] "Given the BOx species were considered to be able to produce highly reactive radicals and release them to gas phase, the BOx sites formed on the BN surface may play a role in increasing the concentration of active species with the assistance of oxygen, e.g. propyl peroxide (C3H7OOH), which may be easily formed by rebound of peroxyl and propyl radicals and then released to the gas phase to react with propylene."

[3] "The unique synergistic activation of propane and ethane over BN was attributed to the mechanism with the co-presence and co-operation of surface-mediated radical formation processes and gas-phase channels, which was different from the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism of redox metal oxides and adsorbed oxygen mechanism of rare-earth oxide."

[4] "Herein, we demonstrated that, during the ODH reaction catalyzed by h-BN, the in-situ formed olefins, which were generally considered chemically inert in boron-based catalytic systems, played a crucial role in promoting parent alkane conversion and cracking of C-C bonds."

[5] "These outcomes demonstrated that the in-situ formed olefins were the most likely products to enhance the oxidation of alkane."

[6] "Given this, here we put forward a hypothesis that PO was an intermediate product formed by the interaction of propane and propylene in the ODH reaction of propane catalyzed by BN."

          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex reaction network. This mechanism is characterized by:

1. Surface-mediated formation of radicals: BOx sites on the BN surface produce highly reactive radicals.

2. Gas-phase reactions: These radicals are released into the gas phase, where they participate in subsequent reactions.

3. Synergistic effects: The combination of surface and gas-phase processes leads to exceptional product distribution and improved catalytic performance.

4. Role of in-situ formed olefins: Previously thought to be inert, these olefins play a crucial role in promoting alkane conversion and C-C bond cracking.

5. Intermediate formation: Propylene oxide (PO) is proposed as an intermediate product formed by the interaction of propane and propylene.

This unique mechanism distinguishes B-based catalysts from traditional catalysts that follow the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or adsorbed oxygen mechanism. The implications for catalyst design and optimization are significant:

1. Improved selectivity and efficiency: The synergistic effects allow for high olefin selectivity and alkane conversion simultaneously.

2. Lower operating temperatures: Activation of alkanes at lower temperatures is possible through the synergistic effect of in-situ formed olefins.

3. Novel catalyst designs: Understanding this mechanism guides the development of catalysts that balance surface and gas-phase reactions for optimal performance.

4. Process optimization: New reaction engineering approaches, such as co-feeding strategies, can be developed to enhance catalyst performance.

5. Holistic approach: Both surface properties and gas-phase chemistry must be considered when optimizing B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions.

This comprehensive understanding opens up new possibilities for catalyst design and process optimization in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, potentially leading to more efficient and selective production of valuable olefins.
