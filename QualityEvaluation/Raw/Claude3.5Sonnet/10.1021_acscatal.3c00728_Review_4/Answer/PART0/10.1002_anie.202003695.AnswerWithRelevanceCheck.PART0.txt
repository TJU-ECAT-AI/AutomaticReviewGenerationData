          [1] "We argue that the remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase."

[2] "Our proposed reaction mechanism (simplified schematic depicted in Figure10) clearly highlights the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry as well as surface-mediated reactions in explaining catalyst performance."

[3] "This simple model is, to our knowledge, the first mechanistic hypothesis that can predict the experimentally observed product distribution of BOx-catalyzed ODH over a range of oxygen partial pressures."

[4] "From a catalytic materials perspective, we hypothesize that surface species that can initiate oxidation while also favoring i-propyl radical formation would lead to enhanced ODH performance."

[5] "We conclude that optimal ODH catalysts should 1)generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane, and 2)not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps."

[6] "Beyond surface speciation, there are observations from catalytic studies that require complementary investigation. Reaction kinetic studies have shown that the predominance of dehydrogenation versus CC bond cleavagethe most important side-reactionis controlled by the oxygen concentration."

          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. This synergistic effect between surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions explains the remarkable product distribution and catalyst performance.

Key aspects of this multidimensional mechanism include:
1. Surface-mediated formation of radicals on metastable sites, followed by their propagation in the gas phase.
2. The interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions, allowing for better control over reaction pathways.
3. The influence of oxygen concentration on the balance between dehydrogenation and C-C bond cleavage.

Implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:
1. Development of catalysts with metastable surface sites that favor specific radical formation (e.g., i-propyl radicals).
2. Optimization of both surface properties and void space in catalyst beds.
3. Design of catalysts that generate reactive H-abstracting species favoring secondary C-H bond abstraction in propane.
4. Minimization of strong interactions between catalysts and intermediates/products to prevent rapid consecutive surface oxidation steps.
5. Consideration of gas-phase radical chemistry in explaining and predicting catalyst performance.

This comprehensive understanding allows for more targeted catalyst design, potentially leading to improved selectivity, activity, and overall performance in ODHP reactions. It also highlights the importance of considering both surface and gas-phase chemistry when developing and optimizing catalysts for complex reactions like ODH.

          基于B的催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质，涉及表面和气相自由基反应，为整体反应网络提供了全面的理解。表面介导反应和气相反应之间的这种协同效应解释了显著的产物分布和催化剂性能。

这种多维机制的关键方面包括：
1. 在亚稳态位点上表面介导的自由基形成，随后在气相中传播。
2. 表面和气相反应之间的相互作用，允许更好地控制反应途径。
3. 氧气浓度对脱氢和C-C键断裂平衡的影响。

对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响：
1. 开发具有有利于形成特定自由基（如异丙基自由基）的亚稳表面位点的催化剂。
2. 优化催化剂床的表面特性和空隙空间。
3. 设计能够产生有利于丙烷中仲C-H键断裂的活性H-抽取物种的催化剂。
4. 最小化催化剂与中间体/产物之间的强相互作用，以防止快速连续的表面氧化步骤。
5. 在解释和预测催化剂性能时考虑气相自由基化学。

这种全面的理解允许更有针对性的催化剂设计，可能导致ODHP反应中选择性、活性和整体性能的改善。它还强调了在开发和优化复杂反应（如ODH）的催化剂时，考虑表面和气相化学的重要性。
