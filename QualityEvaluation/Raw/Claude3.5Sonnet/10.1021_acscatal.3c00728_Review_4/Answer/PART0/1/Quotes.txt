"Our operando infrared spectroscopy and 18O isotope tracer study explicitly demonstrates that BO(H) active sites are formed at the edges of BN through the aid of ethane, and the dehydrogenation circle is completed over these BO sites by the assistance of O2."

"Altogether, we were able to draw two possible catalytic pathways, as determined by the bond-breaking position of ethane (Scheme1). Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

"At high reaction temperatures (X >10%, nonkinetic measuring region), the formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2, which is capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from ethane to form C2H4 and H2O, cannot be ruled out."

"Herein, our oxidation stability test of BN materials also showed that BN materials could not be oxidized below 800C under an O2 atmosphere (see FigureS1 in the Supporting Information), which indicated that with molecular O2 alone it was difficult to form the proposed BO species at the armchair edges under ODH reaction conditions (<600C)."

"We therefore anticipated that O2 activation should be initiated by CH activation. Indeed, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane;"

"It can therefore be proposed that the presence of ethane promotes the activation of adsorbed O2 towards the edges of BN and the formation of BO(H) sites, and the dehydrogenation circle is finally completed over the BO sites."

[1] "Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2"

[2] "Hermans and co-workers proposed that BOON, later on boron oxygen species were responsible for high activity and olefins selectivity that were influenced by electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures."

[3] "Our previous work [12] demonstrated that the BOH sites initially reacted with molecular oxygen leading to the production of BOOB intermediates and further abstracted the hydrogen atoms from propane, forming C3H6 and H2O in the ODH of propane."

[4] "Besides, Zhou et al. [28] further proved that the BOH species can promote the adsorption of O2 through adsorption microcalorimetric experiments."

[5] "An 18O isotope tracer study verified that an oxygen exchange between the surface oxygen atoms in the BOH groups and molecular oxygen occurred in the reaction of ODH process at hydroxylated h-BN catalyst."

[6] "Huang et al. [18] also found that the atomic exchange between 16O2 and 18O2 in the reaction of ODH process at h-BN catalyst."

[7] "Kinetic experiments were performed to gain insights into the reaction pathway of light alkanes ODH over the silicon boride catalyst."

[8] "Moreover, the apparent activation energy (Ea, Fig. S10) were estimated to be 268kJmol1, 244kJmol1 and 160kJmol1 for ethane, propane and isobutane, respectively."

[1] "We hypothesize that hBN activates oxygen and forms surface oxygen species responsible for selective alkane oxidation."

[2] "Buyevskaya et al. carried out Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) experiments to determine the mechanism of propane and oxygen activation in B2O3/Al2O3. The study demonstrated that BOx surface species hinder the H/D exchange between the surface and C3D8 as well as the formation of 18O16O isotopologues. These TAP experiments led the authors to conclude that surface BOx suppresses dissociative adsorption of reactants and was the likely reason for high selectivities toward the olefin product."

[3] "The authors proposed a mechanism involving propyl radical formation on the catalyst surface and continuation of the reaction in the gas phase via alkyl hydroperoxides. While gas phase peroxide and radical decomposition mechanisms are common in combustion and methane conversion literature, further investigations on their role during ODH chemistry will be needed, particularly in the context of high olefin selectivities of B-based catalysts."

[4] "Furthermore, the role of gas phase chemistry must be established and its importance on the observed ODH activity under various conditions considered in future model development."

[1] "With increasing research in this field, the ODHP reaction has gradually been discovered to involve a mixed mechanism including both complicated surface and gas radical reactions instead of a simple surface catalytic process. Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase."

[2] "For the ODHP reaction, both the surface reaction and gas radical reaction occur at the same time. The surface reaction rate will affect the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction will also have an adverse effect on the surface reaction. The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP."

[3] "The mixed heterogeneoushomogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which can be described as the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acting as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase. Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system."

[4] "Notably, some free radicals such as ·OOH, ·C3H7, ·OC3H7, etc., are transferred and exchanged between the surface and gas phase in the whole reaction network. Therefore, the influence of catalyst configuration on free radical transport and reaction must be considered in catalyst design."

[1] "Prior studies have reported that the exceptional product distribution on h-BN catalyst is ascribed to the combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals and subsequent gaseous reactions"

[2] "Given the BOx species were considered to be able to produce highly reactive radicals and release them to gas phase, the BOx sites formed on the BN surface may play a role in increasing the concentration of active species with the assistance of oxygen, e.g. propyl peroxide (C3H7OOH), which may be easily formed by rebound of peroxyl and propyl radicals and then released to the gas phase to react with propylene."

[3] "The unique synergistic activation of propane and ethane over BN was attributed to the mechanism with the co-presence and co-operation of surface-mediated radical formation processes and gas-phase channels, which was different from the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism of redox metal oxides and adsorbed oxygen mechanism of rare-earth oxide."

[4] "Herein, we demonstrated that, during the ODH reaction catalyzed by h-BN, the in-situ formed olefins, which were generally considered chemically inert in boron-based catalytic systems, played a crucial role in promoting parent alkane conversion and cracking of C-C bonds."

[5] "These outcomes demonstrated that the in-situ formed olefins were the most likely products to enhance the oxidation of alkane."

[6] "Given this, here we put forward a hypothesis that PO was an intermediate product formed by the interaction of propane and propylene in the ODH reaction of propane catalyzed by BN."

[1] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity"

[2] "Wu lately reported the improvement of ODHP activity via the gas-phase radical chemistry over VOx-modified BN catalyst, evidenced by the formation of NO according to the observation of synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS)"

[3] "The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, consequently resulting in higher reaction order of propane. It enables the enhanced catalytic performance of embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalyst in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity."

[4] "Combined with kinetic measurements, the reaction in the gas phase initiated by the active boron sites is mainly responsible for the high catalytic performance in ODH of propane reaction."

[5] "Structure characterizations and kinetic measurements revealed that the H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species were responsible for activating propane on the catalysts surface and gas phase, and the reactions in the gas phase were mainly responsible for the high performance in ODHP reaction."

"We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

"Starting from our modeled active site (namely, >BOON<), we then calculated key intermediates for the ODHP reaction. We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical (Fig. 3C). This reaction is reminiscent of an alkyl hydroperoxide reaction proposed earlier to explain the formation of radicals in homogeneous autoxidation systems (ROOH + HR  RO• + HOH + •R) (33)."

"The second-order rate dependence with respect to Pc3h8 suggests that two propane molecules are required to generate two molecules of water, in line with the overall stoichiometry of the reaction. The desorption of these water molecules forms BN edge vacancies that allow for unique O2 activation, which explains the influence that the surface coverage of adsorbed oxygen has on the rate of propane consumption."

[1] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."

[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."

[3] "To investigate the possible radical chemistry, the gas-phase components of the ODHP reaction over h-BN-T catalysts were analyzed online by synchrotron radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS;"

[4] "By coupling the results from kinetic and SVUV-PIMS studies with DFT calculations, detailed reaction pathways are proposed for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts. Propene is mainly formed from surface reaction via the cleavage of CH bonds of propane. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions pathways can contribute to the C1 and C2 products."

[5] "Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts."

[6] "We find the formation of such as ethylene and methyl radicals can occur competitively over either the surface or the gas-phase (Supporting Information, FiguresS30, S31) with similar barriers."

[7] "The proposed mechanism bears similarities to other redox-poor oxides such as MgO, and shares their capacity for selective alkane conversions."

[1] "We argue that the remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase."

[2] "Our proposed reaction mechanism (simplified schematic depicted in Figure10) clearly highlights the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry as well as surface-mediated reactions in explaining catalyst performance."

[3] "This simple model is, to our knowledge, the first mechanistic hypothesis that can predict the experimentally observed product distribution of BOx-catalyzed ODH over a range of oxygen partial pressures."

[4] "From a catalytic materials perspective, we hypothesize that surface species that can initiate oxidation while also favoring i-propyl radical formation would lead to enhanced ODH performance."

[5] "We conclude that optimal ODH catalysts should 1)generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane, and 2)not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps."

[6] "Beyond surface speciation, there are observations from catalytic studies that require complementary investigation. Reaction kinetic studies have shown that the predominance of dehydrogenation versus CC bond cleavagethe most important side-reactionis controlled by the oxygen concentration."

"Our operando infrared spectroscopy and 18O isotope tracer study explicitly demonstrates that BO(H) active sites are formed at the edges of BN through the aid of ethane, and the dehydrogenation circle is completed over these BO sites by the assistance of O2."
