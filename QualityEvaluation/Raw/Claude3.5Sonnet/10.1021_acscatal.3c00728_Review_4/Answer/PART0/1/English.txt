The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase reactions, significantly contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The study reveals two main pathways depending on temperature and conversion rates:

1. Low-temperature pathway (&lt;10% conversion):
   - Ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites at the edges of BN.
   - These BOH sites facilitate direct dehydrogenation of ethane with adsorbed O2.
   - This process produces ethylene and H2 without combustion products.

2. High-temperature pathway (>10% conversion):
   - BO active sites form from adsorbed O2.
   - These BO sites can abstract hydrogen from ethane to form ethylene and water.
   - This pathway involves more aggressive oxidation and can lead to some combustion products.

Key insights into the reaction mechanism:
- O2 activation is initiated by CH activation, not by direct oxidation of BN.
- The formation of BO(H) sites requires both ethane and oxygen, indicating a synergistic effect.
- The catalyst's ability to activate O2 without dissociation is crucial for preventing combustion reactions.

Implications for catalyst performance and design:
1. Temperature control is critical, as it determines which pathway dominates and affects selectivity.
2. Catalyst edge sites are crucial for activity, suggesting that increasing edge exposure could improve performance.
3. Oxygen management is essential to maintain high selectivity while avoiding over-oxidation.
4. Catalyst design should focus on optimizing the distribution and nature of BOH and BO sites.
5. Understanding the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions can guide the development of catalysts that balance activity and selectivity across a wider range of conditions.

These insights can inform strategies for catalyst synthesis, reactor design, and process optimization to achieve higher yields of ethylene while minimizing unwanted side products.

The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts involves complex interactions between surface and gas-phase reactions. The literature suggests that BOH sites on the catalyst surface play a crucial role in the reaction network:

1. Surface reactions:
   - BOH groups act as active sites, selectively breaking C-H bonds while preventing overoxidation to CO2.
   - BOH sites initially react with molecular oxygen to form BOOB intermediates.
   - These intermediates then abstract hydrogen atoms from alkanes (e.g., propane), producing olefins (e.g., propylene) and water.

2. Gas-phase interactions:
   - BOH species promote the adsorption of O2 on the catalyst surface.
   - Oxygen exchange occurs between surface oxygen atoms in BOH groups and gas-phase molecular oxygen.
   - Atomic exchange between different oxygen isotopes (16O2 and 18O2) has been observed during the ODH process.

3. Synergistic effects:
   - The interaction between surface BOH sites and gas-phase oxygen contributes to the overall reaction network and affects catalyst performance.
   - The dynamic nature of the catalyst surface during the reaction, as evidenced by oxygen exchange processes, influences its stability and long-term performance.

4. Reaction kinetics:
   - Kinetic experiments provide insights into the reaction pathway of light alkanes ODH over silicon boride catalysts.
   - Different activation energies for various alkanes (ethane, propane, isobutane) correspond to the strength of their weakest C-H bonds, implying that C-H bond cleavage is a key step in the reaction mechanism.

Implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Understanding the role of BOH sites and their interaction with gas-phase oxygen can guide the development of more efficient catalysts.

This complexity highlights the intricate interplay between heterogeneous catalysis on the boron-based surface and homogeneous gas-phase chemistry.

Surface reactions likely involve the activation of oxygen to form selective oxidizing species, which then interact with alkanes. The formation of propyl radicals on the catalyst surface initiates the dehydrogenation process. These surface reactions are crucial for the high selectivity observed in B-based catalysts, as the BOx species appear to suppress the dissociative adsorption of reactants, which could otherwise lead to overoxidation.

The gas-phase component of the reaction involves the continuation of the dehydrogenation process through alkyl hydroperoxides and other radical species. This step is critical for completing the formation of olefins and may contribute to the high selectivity observed in these systems.
