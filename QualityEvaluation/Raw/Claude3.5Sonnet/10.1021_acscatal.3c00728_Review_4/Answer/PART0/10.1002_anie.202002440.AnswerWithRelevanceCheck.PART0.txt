          [1] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."

[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."

[3] "To investigate the possible radical chemistry, the gas-phase components of the ODHP reaction over h-BN-T catalysts were analyzed online by synchrotron radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS;"

[4] "By coupling the results from kinetic and SVUV-PIMS studies with DFT calculations, detailed reaction pathways are proposed for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts. Propene is mainly formed from surface reaction via the cleavage of CH bonds of propane. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions pathways can contribute to the C1 and C2 products."

[5] "Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts."

[6] "We find the formation of such as ethylene and methyl radicals can occur competitively over either the surface or the gas-phase (Supporting Information, FiguresS30, S31) with similar barriers."

[7] "The proposed mechanism bears similarities to other redox-poor oxides such as MgO, and shares their capacity for selective alkane conversions."

          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly enhances our understanding of the overall reaction network. This complex interplay reveals that propene is primarily formed on the catalyst surface through CH activation of propane, while C1 and C2 products can be generated through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. The direct detection of gas-phase methyl radicals using SVUV-PIMS provides crucial evidence for the existence of gas-phase radical chemistry in this system.

The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have important implications for catalyst performance and design optimization:

1. Selectivity control: Understanding the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions allows for better control of product selectivity. By manipulating catalyst properties and reaction conditions, it may be possible to favor desired pathways and suppress unwanted side reactions.

2. Improved catalyst design: Knowledge of the multidimensional mechanism enables the development of catalysts that can effectively balance surface reactions and gas-phase radical chemistry. This could lead to catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity.

3. Process optimization: The insights gained from this mechanistic understanding can guide the optimization of reaction conditions to maximize desired products while minimizing byproducts.

4. Predictive modeling: The comprehensive reaction network, including both surface and gas-phase pathways, provides a foundation for developing more accurate predictive models of catalyst performance.

5. New catalyst development: The mechanistic insights could inspire the design of novel catalysts that exploit the synergy between surface and gas-phase reactions for improved ODHP performance.

6. Reactor design: The multidimensional nature of the reaction implies that reactor design and operating conditions play a crucial role in optimizing the balance between surface and gas-phase reactions. Factors such as temperature, pressure, and residence time could be fine-tuned to favor desired pathways.

7. Broader applicability: The similarity of this mechanism to other redox-poor oxides like MgO indicates a broader applicability of this understanding to a class of catalysts known for selective alkane conversions.

In conclusion, this deeper understanding of the reaction network opens up new avenues for catalyst design and process optimization in ODHP reactions, potentially leading to more efficient and selective catalytic systems for alkane conversion.
