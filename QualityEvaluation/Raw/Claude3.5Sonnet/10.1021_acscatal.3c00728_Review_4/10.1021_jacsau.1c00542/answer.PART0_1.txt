The given literature does not contain any information related to the multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts or its surface and gas-phase radical reactions. The document appears to be a title and author list for a scientific article about vanadium oxide on boron nitride for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, but does not provide any details about the reaction mechanism or its implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. Without access to the full text of the article, it is not possible to answer this question based on the provided information.

所给的文献中没有包含任何与B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理的多维性质或其表面和气相自由基反应相关的信息。该文档似乎是一篇关于氧化钒在氮化硼上用于丙烷氧化脱氢的科学文章的标题和作者列表,但并未提供有关反应机理或其对催化剂性能和设计优化影响的任何细节。在无法获取文章全文的情况下,无法根据所提供的信息回答这个问题。
