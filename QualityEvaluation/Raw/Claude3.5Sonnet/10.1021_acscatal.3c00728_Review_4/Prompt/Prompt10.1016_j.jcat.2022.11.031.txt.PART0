•
The H-bonded BOH groups are presently identified as the active center for the activation of propane and triggering the gas-phase reactions.
•

Abstract
Boron-containing zeolites have been proven potential in catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process and the boron sites in open coordination are considered as the active center. By considering the diversity and adjustability in the crystal structure of zeolite, there is a great opportunity to further tune the activity and selectivity. Herein, the embryonic borosilicate zeolite with abundant defective sites and developed large porosity is prepared for catalyzing ODH of propane reaction. An  20 % improvement in propylene selectivity is achieved at propane conversion of 21.5 % at 540 C, with propylene productivity nearly an order of magnitude higher compared with crystalline MFI-type borosilicate zeolite. Solid-state NMR reveals the formation of boron sites in open coordination derived from the defect-rich structure of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, guaranteeing ample exposure of the active center. Combined with kinetic measurements, the reaction in the gas phase initiated by the active boron sites is mainly responsible for the high catalytic performance in ODH of propane reaction. The designed experiment indicates the strengthened gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, consequently resulting in the increase of reaction order of propane from 1.06 to 2.30. This work reveals the significant role of gas-phase reactions during the ODH of propane reaction and provides a new insight for boosting the propylene selectivity of zeolite-based catalysts.

. Recently, boron-containing zeolite catalysts with diversity and adjustability crystal structures are capable of catalyzing ODHP reaction and provide a unique perspective to understand the reaction process and further develop highly active and selective catalysts

. The aggregated boron species embedded in MWW- and MFI-typed zeolite displayed high efficiency in activating propane
[11]

[13]

[14]
. However, the hydrolysis-prone nature of BOB unit in the aggregated boron species tend to raise stability problem of the catalysts in humid atmosphere. The silanol-rich structure was shown to disperse boron species and limit their detachment from the catalytic system through the redispersion of over-hydrolyzed boron species. Lately, the isolated boron site with B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolite showed durability in long period test and enabled the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through three hydrogen bonds on the boron site
[12]
. In addition, the selectivity of propylene in zeolite-based catalysts was much lower under identical propane conversion compared with other boron-based catalysts. It was noteworthy that propane reaction orders of 1 and 1.5 were observed in zeolite-based catalysts, suggesting the surface activation of propane was more favourable
[12]
,
[13]
. These results enlightened that the activation of propane on the surface might dominate the ODHP process over zeolite-based catalysts, resulting in the distinctive catalytic properties and distinguishing them from other boron-based catalysts.
For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity

. Wu lately reported the improvement of ODHP activity via the gas-phase radical chemistry over VOx-modified BN catalyst, evidenced by the formation of NO according to the observation of synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS)
[25]
. Moreover, a 1.4-order dependent on the propane partial pressure was observed, which was caused by the enhanced surface contribution catalyzed by VOx site. Therefore, it can be reasonably deduced that the lower reaction order of propane and catalytic activity over zeolite-based catalysts could result from the limited contribution of gas-phase reactions. In consideration of the reaction pathways, the construction of highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions might be a feasible way to construct highly active and selective ODHP catalysts.
Compared with crystalline zeolite with microporous structure and saturated coordination framework atoms, embryonic zeolitic materials have the feature of extra-large microporosity with several unit cell dimensions of size. The greatly exposed small unit cells allow guest molecules easy to diffuse and the extra-large micropores improve the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites. More importantly, after embedding boron atoms, the defect-rich zeolitic structures offer abundant SiOH and BOH groups, which contributed to the stabilization of boron species and construction of active boron centers with proton transfer with adjacent SiOH through hydrogen bonds. In addition, the large microporous spaces provide free environments for gas-phase reactions, allowing X-ray amorphous zeolitic material as a model system for the fundamental investigation of ODHP reaction.
Herein, the embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) was prepared and used for investigating the ODHP reaction. Structure characterizations and kinetic measurements revealed that the H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species were responsible for activating propane on the catalysts surface and gas phase, and the reactions in the gas phase were mainly responsible for the high performance in ODHP reaction. The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, consequently resulting in higher reaction order of propane. It enables the enhanced catalytic performance of embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalyst in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity.
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The amorphous embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalysts were synthesized using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as organic structure-directing agents (OSDA) from clear homogeneous sols with a molar composition of SiO2: B2O3: TPAOH: H2O: EtOH = 1: x: 0.14: 21: 4 (x = 0.084, 0.168, 0.252 and 0.336). Typically, boric acid (Sinopharm) was dissolved in 4.8 g aqueous solution of TPAOH (25 wt%, Guangfu) and 24 mL deionized water with stirring at room temperature. Then, 8.68 g tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Sinopharm) was slowly added to the mixture and strongly stirred for 24 h. Then the gel was filtered, washed, dried by freeze-drying at 50 C under vacuum, and finally calcined at 550 C in the air for 6 h to remove the templating agent. The obtained solid product was washed thoroughly with deionized water at 60 C for 3 h to remove the soluble boron species, then the sample was filtrated, washed with ethanol, dried at 50 C, and calcined at 550 C for 2 h in air. The obtained samples were named EBZ-1, EBZ-2, EBZ-3, and EBZ-4, accordingly with B2O3: SiO2 of 0.084, 0.168, 0.252, and 0.336 in the sols. The EBZ-2-AT was prepared by stirring 500 mg EBZ-2 in 25 mL nitric acid (15 mol/L) at 80 C for 4 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was filtered, washed, dried at 120 C, and finally calcined at 550 C in air for 2 h.
The crystalline borosilicate MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) was synthesized with similar molar composition of EBZ-2. The resulting homogeneous sol was strongly stirred for 2 h at room temperature, then further hydrothermal treated at 150 C for 3 days in Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was filtered, dried, and finally calcined at 550 C in air for 6 h to remove the templating agent.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The actual boron content of the zeolites was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on Optima2000DV. Before the measurements, the sample (50 mg) was dissolved by hydrochloric acid (1 mL) and hydrofluoric acid (1 mL) mixed solution in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 150 C for 1 h. After evaporating up the solution that contained hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid, we repeatedly added deionized water into the Teflon container and then collected the solution into a polypropylene volumetric flask, finally fixed the solution volume as 25 mL.
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was recorded on PANalytical XPert3 Powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The zeolite powder was placed inside a quartz-glass sample holder for testing. The tube voltage was 40 kV, and the current was 40 mA.
N2 sorption isotherms were measured with an ASAP 2020 sorption analyzer (Micromeritics). Prior to the measurement, the sample was degassed by evacuation at 200 C for 6 h. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface area (SBET). Total pore volume (Vtotal) was calculated from the amount of gas adsorbed at a relative pressure P/P0 of 0.99. Micropore volume (Vmicro) was calculated using the t-plot method. The micro-mesopore size distribution was extracted from density functional theory modeling of the adsorption branch.
Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed on STA 449 F3 (NETZSCH) in air atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 C/min from room temperature to 800 C. Prior to analysis, the catalysts were pre-treated with flowing Ar (40 mL/min) at 200 C for 2 h, and then cooled to ambient temperature. The CO2 generated was monitored by online mass spectrometry (MS).
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. In-situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectra were collected on a Bruker 70 V spectrometer equipped with an in-situ reaction cell (HARRICK) and MCT detector. The catalyst powder (30 mg) was placed in the cell and pretreated at 530 C for 2 h in a flow of Ar. Subsequently, the sample was maintained at 500 C in flowing C3H8/O2/Ar (volume ratio of 1.5:1:2.5) gas mixture. The evolution of surface species was monitored by IR by averaging 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm1.
11B MAS NMR spectra were recorded on Agilent DD2-500 MHz spectrometer with an 11.7 T magnet, using a 4-mm MAS NMR probe with a spinning rate of 10 kHz. The spectra were acquired with 600 scans per increment, a recycle delay of 3 s. Chemical shifts were referenced to a 1 M H3BO3 aqueous solution at 19.6 ppm.
29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 99.3 MHz, using a 6-mm MAS NMR probe with a spinning rate of 4 kHz. The spectra were acquired with 500 scans per increment, a recycle delay of 4 s. Kaolin was used as the chemical shift reference.
2.3. Catalytic tests of propane oxidative dehydrogenation
Selective oxidation of propane was studied in a fixed bed reactor (I. D. = 8 mm, length = 420 mm, treated with nitric acid) packed with 100 mg catalyst (without diluent, 4060 mesh) in the middle of reactor and heated to 490550 C under atmospheric pressure. The feed gas contains C3H8/O2/N2 with a volume ratio of 1.5:1:2.5 at a weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV) of 5.3 gC3H8 gcat1h1. Before reaction, each EBZ catalyst was pretreated to stabilize the coordination environment of boron species under reaction conditions. Reactants and products were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC 7980) equipped with a GDX-102 and molecular sieve 5A column. A TCD was used to detect O2, N2, C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, CO, and CO2. H2 was not detected in EBZ catalysts. Conversion was defined as the number of moles of carbon converted divided by the number of moles of carbon present in the feed. Selectivity was defined as the number of moles of carbon in the product divided by the number of moles of carbon reacted. The carbon balance was checked by comparing the number of moles of carbon in the outlet stream to the number of moles of carbon in the feed. Under our typical evaluating conditions, the carbon balance was generally higher than 95 %.
The controlled homogeneous gas-phase reactions of propane were performed under the same experimental conditions, except for packing quartz sand (4060 mesh) to fill the empty volume of the reactor on both sides of the catalyst bed. The free space distance after the catalyst was adjusted to  0, 5, 10, and  25 mm for modulating the gas-phase reaction.
The mass and heat transfer diffusion limitations have been ruled out for the highest propane reaction rate based on the Weisz-Prater criterion and Mears criterion
