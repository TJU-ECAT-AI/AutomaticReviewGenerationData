<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about ODHP reaction mechanisms over B-based catalysts or gas-phase radical reactions. The document focuses on chromium-based catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), not oxidative dehydrogenation. There is no mention of boron catalysts or multidimensional reaction networks involving both surface and gas-phase reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于B基催化剂上ODHP反应机理或气相自由基反应的任何信息。该文档主要关注丙烷脱氢(DHP)的铬基催化剂,而不是氧化脱氢。文中没有提到硼催化剂或涉及表面和气相反应的多维反应网络。因此,无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。
