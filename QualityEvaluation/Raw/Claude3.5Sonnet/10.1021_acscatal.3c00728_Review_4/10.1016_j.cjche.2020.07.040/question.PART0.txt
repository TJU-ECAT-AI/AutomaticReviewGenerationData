Abstract
Boron-based metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have drawn great attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive activity and olefin selectivity. Herein, the SiO2 and B2O3 sequentially coated honeycomb cordierite catalyst is designed by a two-step wash-coat method with different B2O3 loadings (0.1%10%) and calcination temperatures (600, 700, 800C). SiO2 obtained by TEOS hydrolysis acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups. The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst. The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1, leading to a high propylene space time yield of 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1 by suppressing the overoxidation. The obtained results strongly indicate that the boron-based monolithic catalyst can be properly fabricated to warrant the high activity and high throughput with its high gas/surface ratio and straight channels.

1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important chemical building blocks [
1
]. The production of propylene from dehydrogenation of propane offers an important route for the value-added utilization of shale gas and the diversification in olefin supply. It could release the dependence of petroleum resources and accelerate the economic benefit development [
2
]. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has attracted great attention due to the lower energy consumption, anti-carbon deposition and equilibrium limit broken in propane conversion [
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
]. In the past decades, a variety of metal-based catalysts such as vanadium, nickel, iron, chrome and cesium-based catalysts, have been wildly studied for ODHP, which however suffered from poor propylene selectivity (less than 60% at a propane conversion of  20%) because of over-oxidation of olefins [
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
].
Boron-based metal free catalysts for ODHP are burgeoning in recent years due to the impressive propylene selectivity [
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
]. In the previous work, we reported that the edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) efficiently catalyzed ODHP, reaching a propylene selectivity of 80.2% with a little CO2 (0.5%) at propane conversion of 20.6%. On the basis of understanding the reaction mechanism, B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst has been prepared, which performed higher catalytic activity because the abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species presented as active sites while the formation of BOSi bonds effectively anchored the boron species [
16
]. Later on, B2O3 supported on commercial SiO2 (specific surface area of 300m2·g1) was also reported [
17
]. The high activity, olefin selectivity and commercial availability of B2O3 make the supported boron oxide catalyst being attractive candidate for industrial application.
Despite the promising advances of particulate boron-based catalysts in ODHP reaction, the problems such as high pressure drop of the catalyst packing and poor mass transfer in the catalyst pellets may limit their large scale application [
18
,
19
].To overcome these shortcomings, it is particularly desirable to develop catalysts that possess both excellent catalytic performance and enhanced mass transfer. Monolithic honeycomb ceramic catalyst with well-developed straight channels is capable to facilitate the active phase dispersion and efficient use of the catalyst, narrow the residence time differences and lower the pressure drop under high space velocity [
20
]. Owing to these advantages, monolithic honeycomb ceramic catalysts have been proven applicable to many fields such as the destruction of organic compounds [
21
], low temperature CO catalytic oxidation [
22
], selective catalytic reduction of NOx [
23
] and catalytic combustion [
24
]. Among several options, cordierite honeycomb monolith (2MgO2Al2O35SiO2) is the most popularly used catalyst support, due to the excellent hydrothermal stability, high mechanical stability and plasticity [
21
,
[25]
,
[26]
,
[27]
].
Herein, we prepared monolithic cordierite honeycomb catalyst by a two-step wash-coating of SiO2 and B2O3, which exhibited good catalytic activity and high propylene selectivity for ODHP. The advantages of monolithic structure were also discussed on the basis of catalytic performance under high GHSV.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The honeycomb cordierite (denoted as HC, non-metal chemical machinery plant co. LTD, Yixing, Jiangsu) was cleaned by HNO3 (4 molL1), then washed by deionized water until pH=7, and followed by drying and 600C calcination for 2h. The pretreated cordierite was dipped into the SiO2 sol (TEOS (C8H20O4Si)/H2O/Ethanol=0.6/5/2, pH 2.5, hydrolyzation at 60C for 12h [
28
]) for 10min until the air inside the channels were removed, then aged in a sealed container at 30C for 12h. The wash-coated SiO2@HC was further dried at 50C for 12h and calcined at 800C for 2h before use.
As a typical example, the supported B2O3 on SiO2@HC catalyst with the B2O3 loading of 5% was obtained by dipping the SiO2@HC support into boric acid solution with H3BO3 concentration of 1molL1 at 65C for 10min until the air bubbles disappeared, then dried at 50C for 12h. Subsequently, the sample was calcined at 700C for 2h to produce the supported B2O3/SiO2@HC catalysts. The loading amount of B2O3 of the catalyst was calculated by the equation of wt%=(mm0)/m, where wt% stands for the B2O3 loading, m and m0 are the mass of B2O3/SiO2@HC and SiO2@HC, respectively [
23
]. In addition, the pre-treated cordierite was crushed into powder, then loaded with SiO2 and B2O3 by impregnation, to prepare the powder samples, which are denoted as HC-p, SiO2@HC-p and B2O3/SiO2@HC-p, respectively. Supported BPO4 catalyst on cordierite was prepared by dipping pretreated cordierite into the mixture of 0.3molL1 H3BO3 solution and H3PO4 (mole rate B/P=1) for 10min until air bubbles disappeared, then dried at 50C for 12h. Subsequently, the sample was calcined at 700C for 2h to produce 4% BPO4@HC.
2.2. Characterization
The honeycomb monolith and catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The SEM investigations were carried out with a Hitachi FESEM SU8220 instrument to examine the cross section of the monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC. The element chemical analysis was implemented with a NOVA Nano SEM 450 instrument. A layer of gold film was deposited on the catalyst to improve the electric conductivity. The XRD patterns were recorded on PANalytical X'Pert3 Powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15406nm). The tube voltage was 40kV, and the current was 40mA.
2.3. Activity test
The catalytic tests were carried out with the entire monolith (600cpsi, dimeter: 11mm, length: 15mm) placed inside a quartz reactor (=12mm). The feed flow consisted of C3H8, O2, N2 (C3H8: O2:N2=1:1.5:3.5) with the total flow rate of 48ml·min1, 96ml·min1 and 144ml·min1, and the bed temperature was varied in the range of 450C540C. The temperature was measured by a thermocouple placed at the inlet of the catalyst bed. The SiO2@HC was used for blank test. Both reactants and products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC 7900). A GDX-102 and molecular sieve 5A column, connected to a TCD were used to analyze the O2, N2, C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, CO, and CO2.
The Carberry number [
29
,
30
], which indicates the influence of external diffusion on the rate of reaction, was much smaller than 0.05. Therefore, the influence of external gassolid mass transfer on the reaction rate was excluded.
The propane conversion was calculated as the number of carbon moles converted divided by the number of carbon moles in the feed gas. Selectivity was calculated as the number of carbon moles in the product divided by the number of carbon moles reacted. The propylene productivity was defined as the grams of propylene produced per gram boron oxide on the catalyst per hour. The carbon balance was kept in the range of 95%100% for all reaction process. To account for the volume expansion in the reaction, nitrogen was used as the internal standard.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. The structural features of the SiO2 and B2O3 sequentially coated honeycomb cordierite catalyst
As shown in
Fig. 1
a, the supported B2O3 on SiO2 pre-coated cordierite honeycomb ceramic catalyst (B2O3/SiO2@HC) exhibited a honeycomb structure with parallel square channels (600 cells per square inch) and 0.24mm wall thickness. The morphology of B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst was investigated by SEM at the cross-section (
Fig. 1
b), where the SiO2-B2O3 layer was clearly observed on the cordierite substrate. Furthermore, the EDS mapping showed the investigated B2O3 uniformly distributed on the surface of the coating layer (

The XRD measurements were carried out using the powder samples. The XRD patterns for B2O3/SiO2@HC-p, SiO2@HC-p and HC-p are shown in
Fig. 2
. The three samples showed the signals mainly assigned to cordierite, while the sample B2O3/SiO2@HC-p showed two peaks centered at 14.5 and 27.7 which were attributed to B2O3 (ICDD: 00-006-0297), confirming the formation of B2O3 phase. However, no peak belonged to SiO2 was detected for the sample SiO2@HC-p and the B2O3/SiO2@HC-p, probably due to the small loading amount and amorphous nature of SiO2.

The catalyst structure stability remains an important inspection parameter for the monolithic catalyst that the coating layer usually detaches from the support, leading to the deactivation of catalyst [
31
,
32
]. Therefore, the adhesion test was implemented by sonicating in petroleum ether for 150min (30min for each time followed by drying at 50C for 1h). The mass losses of the five tests are almost zero. These results showed the excellent adhesion of the coating layer on the cordierite, indicating the strong interaction between B2O3 and the SiO2@HC support.
3.2. Optimization of the B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst
The effect of temperature on catalyst activity and products selectivity was investigated over B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst, as shown in
Fig. 3
a and b. The presence of B2O3 largely promoted the catalytic activity as compared to the SiO2@HC support. The conversion of propane approached 16.0% at 500C, with high selectivity of olefin, e.g. C3H6 (84.9%), C2H4 (8.0%), and small amount of CO2 (0.3%), achieving a propylene yield of 13.6%, whereas SiO2@HC showed little activity. Furthermore, a series of B2O3/SiO2@HC catalysts with varied loadings or calcination temperatures (denoted as X% B2O3/SiO2@HC and B2O3/SiO2@HC-T, respectively) were prepared in order to optimize the catalytic performance. As shown in
Fig. 3
c, raising the loading of B2O3 from 0.1%1%, the catalytic activity increased, with propane conversion increasing from 2.8% to 17.7% at 500C, and the catalyst activity did not depend on B2O3 loading in the range from 1% to 5%, possibly due to the similar amount of accessible active sites. However, when the B2O3 loading increased to 10%, the activity of the catalyst decreased.
Fig. 3
d shows that catalysts calcined at 600C and 700C exhibited similar activity. However, when the catalyst was calcined at high temperature of 800C, its propane conversion was down to approximately 8% even at the reaction temperature of 500C. This conversion value was much lower than that over the catalysts calcined at 600C and 700C. As a result, the B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst with 5% B2O3 loading and calcined at 700C was used for the following investigation. These results confirm that B2O3 is the active phase for ODHP, which was consistent with our previous work [
16
]. Thermal treatments during calcination or under reaction condition may cause B2O3 vitrification or densification [
33
,
34
], causing the loss of accessible surface BOH groups. Therefore, B2O3 coated firmly on the cordierite channel walls and calcined properly are important for the design of boron-based monolithic catalysts.

Reaction conditions: gas feed, 16.7vol% C3H8, 25.0vol% O2, N2 balance; flow rate 48ml·min1.
The catalytic stability test of B2O3/SiO2@HC is shown in
Fig. 4
. The conversion of propane ( 16%), the selectivity of propylene (84.5%) and ethylene (6.5%) were constant at 500C for 20h on stream with no catalyst weight loss, demonstrating that after calcination at high temperature, active boron species were well anchored on SiO2@HC. In comparison, the stability test was conducted over a control catalyst, i.e. 5% B2O3@HC, however, 10% B2O3 component weight loss was found after 20h operation. The results mentioned above suggest that the bare cordierite was insufficient for boron immobilization. The reason could be that commercial cordierite honeycomb is usually produced after calcination at high temperature of  1400C, causing its surface inertness with limited anchoring MOH groups (MSi, Mg, Al). To solve this problem, the cordierite support was modified by an additional silica coating layer which can attach firmly on the cordierite substrate possibly by forming SiOAl, SiOMg, SiOSi bonds, and attach to the boron oxide layer via SiOB bonds. In this way, the silica layer, which has been confirmed inert toward ODHP, was used as the media layer to bridge the cordierite and boron oxide via the abundant SiOH groups, and thus enhancing the catalyst thermal stability and meanwhile, tightly bridging the B2O3 layer and the substrate [

Recently, h-BN and BPO4 have been realized as the active catalysts for ODH of propane [
36
]. To better clarify the advantages of B2O3 monolithic catalyst, h-BN/Cordierite [
37
] and the BPO4@HC with the same boron loading were taken into comparison. The 3% h-BN/Cordierite catalyst was prepared by CVD with H3BO3 and urea as precursors calcinating at 1000C, and the 4% BPO4@HC catalyst was prepared by dipping in the solution of H3PO4 and H3BO3 followed by calcination (details see
Section 2.1
). All of the three monolithic catalysts exhibited similar structure with straight channels of 600cpsi and was test under a flow rate of 48ml·min1.
Fig. 5
shows the propane conversion curve as a function of temperature over the three samples, the activity of h-BN/Cordierite was similar to that of B2O3/SiO2@HC, indicating a similar amount of active sites present on these two catalysts. However, an induction period of 3h is necessarily used for the h-BN/Cordierite to reach the optimal performance. Moreover, the BPO4@HC shows the lowest activity compared to B2O3/SiO2@HC and h-BN/Cordierite. It should be pointed out that the tricoordinated BO species has been proposed as the active sites of the boron-based catalyst over ODHP [
16
]. In the case of BPO4, boron species are presents as tetracoordinated. Overall, the B2O3/SiO2@HC could be recognized as a competitive catalyst in ODHP.

3.3. Effect of catalyst support on catalytic performance
To illustrate the role of catalyst structure of B2O3/SiO2@HC, the B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst with the same B2O3 loading weight was taken as comparison. The propylene selectivity as a function of propane conversion was plotted in
Fig. 6
a and the products selectivity comparison at low propane conversion was shown in
Fig. 6
b. It shows that the selectivity of the C3H6 was 92.9% (Selolefin  96.5%) and CO2 was not detected over the B2O3/SiO2@HC and the selectivity of the C3H6 and CO2 over the B2O3/SBA-15 was 84.1% and 1.3% (Selolefin  94.6%) [
16
], respectively. Furthermore, the propylene selectivity of B2O3/SiO2@HC (92%) is higher than other SiO2 supported boron oxide catalyst such as B/SiO2 (77%) [
17
] at similar propane conversion. These results show that the monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC was much more selective toward propylene than the other SiO2 supported pellet catalyst at similar propane conversions. These results suggested that the catalyst supports may have great impact on the product distribution of the resultant catalysts. Because the monolithic structure allows a uniform flow distribution facilitating the utilization of the active component, and the catalytic layer wash-coated on the monolithic wall shorten the diffusion paths so that the overoxidation was restrained. On the other hand, the negative effect of SiO2 was reported on propylene selectivity for h-BN and B/SiO2 catalysts [
17
,
30
]. However, the SiO2 coating layer on the monolithic support showed no negative effect on selectivity but largely improved the catalyst stability.

To determine the key factor of high selectivity, the space velocity dependence was investigated over B2O3/SiO2@HC at a similar propane conversion that adjusted by slightly varying the reaction temperature. As shown in
Fig. 7
a and
Table 1
, the product distribution depended on the space velocity. With a propane conversion of  16.0%, olefin selectivity increased from 92.9% to 97.6% as the space velocity increased. At the highest GHSV used, the selectivity of CO2 was as low as 0.1%, reaching a space time yield of propylene as 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1. This result is better than that over traditional metal oxide catalysts and also better than that over the most of boron-based catalysts (

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the honeycomb cordierite monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst was designed and prepared by a two-step coating method. A high selectivity toward olefin (97.2%) and negligible production of CO2 (0.1%) under high space velocity gave a high propylene productivity of 15.7 g C3H6(g B2O3)1·h1 for ODHP. The promising performance of the catalyst was attributed to not only the efficient dispersion and firm attachment of the catalytically active B2O3 layer on the modified SiO2@HC support, but also the improved mass transfer brought by the honeycomb structure. Overall, the SiO2- and B2O3-coated honeycomb cordierite monolith could be potentially recognized for industrial application of ODHP.
