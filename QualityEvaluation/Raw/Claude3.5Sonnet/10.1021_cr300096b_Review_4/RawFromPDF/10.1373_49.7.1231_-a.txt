This relatively short book is crammed
with useful tips and pointers for users
of this powerful spectroscopic tech-
nique. The book is organized into
seven chapters, with an extensive list
of literature references at the end.
Organization of the text is logical,
moving from a general overview,
theory, and background to method
development
(chapter
4),
routine
analysis (chapter 5), and the very
valuable
“Trouble-Shooting
and
Maintenance” (chapter 6). Numerous
specific applications are described in
some detail, and original research
manuscripts or government proto-
cols (e.g., USEPA) are referenced.
To this reviewer, the most useful
and unique feature of the book was
the inclusion of complementary in-
formation,
listed
with
identifying
symbols as “practical tips”, addi-
tional information, and complemen-
tary theory. These items are inserted
into the text clearly identified with
corresponding symbols in a way that
is useful and illuminating rather than
distracting to the flow of the text.
One
might
be
reminded
of
the
“Dummies” series of books, which
use a similar system for adding an-
cillary or explanatory materials.
All in all, this book should find its
way to the laboratory bookshelf and
be in constant use by practitioners.
The author’s many years of practice
and teaching of this useful technique
are clearly evident in the style and
clarity of presentation. The cost of
the book will not prevent its wide
use in the analytical and teaching
communities.

A Manager’s Guide to the Design
and
Conduct
of
Clinical
Trials.
Phillip I. Good. New York: John
Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2002, 242 pp.,
$64.95. ISBN 0-471-22615-7.
This book is must-have reading for
anyone in the business of designing,
managing, or conducting clinical tri-
als of drugs or medical devices. It is
easy to read and full of practical
pointers gleaned from the author’s
experience as a statistician and a con-
sultant to the Pharma industry; two
resources often brought in after the
fact to rescue a venture gone sour.
Taken to heart, Good’s philosophy
that it is better to prepare rather than
to repair will go a long way in assur-
ing the success of any clinical trial.
The book is arranged in a logical
series of chapters, each covering a
part of clinical trial planning, perfor-
mance, or analysis. The use of topics
and multiple short subtopics, usually
1–3 pages, devoted to a single con-
cept makes it easy to find specific
items when needed. As a result, the
book is a usable handbook that can
be referred to as needed. Emphasis is
placed on planning and monitoring
at all stages of the process as the best
ways to reduce errors in clinical tri-
als. The author obviously knows the
cost in terms of time and money that
errors contribute to the expense of a
trial and the negative effect they
have on regulatory agencies.
Unfortunately, the author misses
an opportunity to describe several
important roles of the clinical labo-
ratory in performance of clinical
trials as they are currently prac-
ticed. Phase III clinical trials, the
focus of this book, are typically
conducted at multiple clinical sites
with specimens sent to a central
laboratory for analysis. Good does
not discuss the advantages of using
a central laboratory vs multiple lo-
cal laboratories with regard to the
impact on data entry, data analysis,
or study monitoring—three items
that are stressed as critical for the
success of clinical trials.
Chapter 10 is devoted to “Comput-
er-Assisted
Data
Entry”
and
de-
scribes the advantages of electronic
case report forms (e-CRF) over the
typically used paper forms. At some
time in the future, the widespread
use of such e-CRFs will undoubtedly
streamline data entry and improve
the quality of such data. However,
today most clinical trials use the pa-
Clinical Chemistry 49, No. 7, 2003

per forms, and the conversion to e-
CRFs is slow. The possible mecha-
nisms for the transfer of data from
the central laboratory to the spon-
sor’s central database are mentioned
only in passing in chapter 11 (Data
Management). This is disconcerting
given the large amount of data often
collected and the need for the labo-
ratory to take responsibility for noti-
fying
clinical
sites
and
sponsors
when specific test results exceed pre-
defined critical limits (physician alert
values).
Although the book gives little di-
rect consideration to the role of the
clinical laboratory in clinical trials, it
will be of value to the laboratorian
who wishes to be educated in the
performance of clinical trials. Good’s
liberal use of anecdotal sidebars is
helpful to give practical depth to his
suggestions, and the numerous refer-
ences make this book a valuable ref-
erence resource.

Basic Atomic and Molecular Spec-
troscopy. J. Michael Hollas. New
York: Wiley Interscience, 2002, 192
pp., $34.95, softcover. ISBN 0-471-
28162-X.
As the title suggests, this book is a
basic overview of atomic and molec-
ular spectroscopy. The Preface states
that spectroscopy and quantum me-
chanics are intimately related. This
can be supported by simply glancing
at the Table of Contents: approxi-
mately one-half of the chapters are
about
quantum
mechanics;
only
about one-half of the chapters dis-
cuss spectroscopy directly.
The book is generally well written
and should be accessible to those
who have not had either quantum
mechanics or spectroscopy in a pre-
vious course. Both quantum mechan-
ics and spectroscopy can be heavily
mathematical, but the book (thank-
fully, in the minds of some) avoids
heavy derivations and other mathe-
matical manipulations and focuses
strongly on the results and their ap-
plication to spectroscopy. The initial
introduction of quantum mechanics
and the Schro
¨dinger equation, the
central equation of quantum me-
chanics, is deceptively simplified—
the purist in me objects, but the real-
ist in me recognizes (and ultimately
agrees with) the need to get over the
details of quantum mechanics and
focus on its conclusions relating to
spectroscopy.
The book covers the fundamentals
of electronic, vibrational, and rota-
tional spectroscopy, with some men-
tion of the Raman technique. Not
covered are more elaborate forms of
spectroscopy such as photoelectron
or Mo
¨ssbauer spectroscopy, which is
appropriate for a book of this level.
Unfortunately, in my opinion, there
is no mention of resonance spectros-
copies such as electron spin reso-
nance (ESR) or nuclear magnetic res-
onance
(NMR)
spectroscopy.
Not
only are these important and useful
techniques that should be included
in a tutorial book like this, but the
physics behind magnetic spectrosco-
pies are so different from “normal”
absorption and emission spectrosco-
pies that their discussion widens a
student’s perspective. Perhaps the
author can consider adding this ma-
terial in a next edition.
The ordering of chapters may be
confusing at first. First are several
chapters on the quantum mechanical
treatments of electronic, vibrational,
and rotational behavior, which are
followed by a short chapter on how
spectra are measured. Next are sev-
eral chapters on electronic, vibra-
tional, and rotational spectroscopy. It
might have made more sense to jux-
tapose the chapters on electronic be-
havior and electronic spectroscopy,
the chapters on vibrations and vibra-
tional spectroscopy, and so forth.
Finally, the book has several exam-
ple questions posed and answered
throughout the chapters, as well as a
few exercises to work out at the end
of each chapter. These problems are a
nice touch for this sort of book, but I
would have liked to see more em-
phasis on how the units work out in
the numerical problems. Students
need to realize that in physical sci-
ence, units are just as important as, if
not more than, numbers. Especially
when you consider how convoluted
some of our derived units are, seeing
a more explicit treatment of how the
units interact in mathematical ma-
nipulations would be welcome.

A Clinical Guide to Inherited Met-
abolic Diseases, 2nd edition. Joe
T.R. Clarke. Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 2002, 306 pp., $40.00,
softcover. ISBN 0-521-89076-4.
Although many textbooks are avail-
able on inherited metabolic dis-
eases, they are usually big in size
and
unapproachable.
Dr.
Clarke
has done an amazing task in pro-
viding this handy guide of approx-
imately 300 pages on how to diag-
nose inherited metabolic diseases.
Just as tourists need a travel guide
when visiting new places, pediatri-
cians and laboratorians will use this
clinical guide, which shows them
the way to arrive at a diagnosis.
This book begins with a chapter on
general principles of genetics, which
serves as a quick review of basic
medical sciences for clinicians. The
next six chapters describe six groups
of major presenting symptoms in
inherited metabolic diseases—neuro-
logic, acidosis, hepatic, cardiac, stor-
age, and acute metabolic—in new-
borns. In each of these chapters,
more detailed subdivisions of the
presentation types are listed at the
beginning of the chapter. For exam-
ple, in the chapter on neurologic pre-
sentation, symptoms are divided into
