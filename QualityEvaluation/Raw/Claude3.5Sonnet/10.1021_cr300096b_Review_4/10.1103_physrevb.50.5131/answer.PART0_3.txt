<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided scientific literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the question about CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. The document appears to be about a self-consistent Green's function technique for bulk and surface impurity calculations, which is unrelated to the topic of the question. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on this literature.

所提供的科学文献不包含任何与回答CO和H2化学吸附技术表征双金属催化剂相关的信息。该文档似乎是关于体相和表面杂质计算的自洽格林函数技术，与问题主题无关。因此，我无法根据这篇文献提供答案。
